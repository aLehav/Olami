Women, MTV
personality share
their stories of
abortion
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
The Pendleton Room of the
Michigan Union was filled to the
brim Thursday evening - many
had to stand at the back for lack
of room as they waited to hear
personal stories about women's
abortion experiences.
The University's chapter of
Students for Choice hosted the
event, 1 in 3 Abortion Speak
Out, to create a safe space for
women who have had abortions
to share their experiences. This
"speak-out" forum was the sec-
ond of its kind nationally. The
first occurred in the Civil Rights
and Public Policy conference at
Hampshire College in Massa-

chusetts last year.
Public Policy junior Carly
Manes and LSA senior Sydney
Gallup, co-presidents of Students
for Choice, said the was event
was intended to be an open envi-
ronmentwhere women couldfeel
free to discuss their experiences
with abortion and feel supported.
"We decided to do an abortion
speak out because we think it's
the best way for people to speak
directlyto their own experiences
and their own story," Manes said.
"A lot of women on campus don't
talk about their abortion experi-
ences."
The eventbegan with a mono-
logue from guest speaker Katie
Stack, who was featured on a
special episode of MTV's 16
and Pregnant TV show entitled
"No Easy Decision." Since then,
she has investigated anti-abor-
tion organizations nationwide
through The Crisis Project and
advocated for reproductive free-

Ed. adviser to
Obama speaks
. at Ford School

'U' alum Michael
Rodriguez aims to
create new student
aid standards
By TYLER GRINN
For theDaily
Students in over their heads
with student loans may want to
pay attention to new ideas com-
ing from the Ford School of Pub-
lic Policy this weekend.
The Public Policy School
kicked off its two-and-a-half-day
Conference on Student Loans,
yesterday with an address by
University alum Roberto Rodri-
guez, special assistant to Presi-
dent Barack Obama for education
policy. The focus of the confer-
ence is to better understand the
effects arid structure of student
debt, as well as to spur research
on the poorly understood topic.
Before joining the administra-
tion's education team, Rodriguez
'worked on Capitol Hill as chief
education counsel to former
senator Ted Kennedy. During his
time working with legislators,
Rodriguez contributed to the

development of landmark K-12
education programs such as the
No Child Left Behind Act and
worked on reauthorizing legis-
lations like the Head Start pro-
gram.
A video of the speech was
simultaneously streamed on the
school's website and questions to
Rodriguez were collected with
#policytalks on Twitter. Audi-
ence members also submitted
questions through paper.
Rodriguez's address focused
on the creation of a new college
rating system mandated by the
Obama administration. He pro-
posed a ratingthatwould include
more reliable data for students
about the personal economic risk
and reward for individual col-
leges. It would also distribute
federal financial aid to universi-
ties in proportion to the success
of their graduates.
"Almost all the federal student
aid that flows to colleges is given
based on the number of students
who enroll in thatschool," Rodri-
guez said.
He added that more factors
need to be taken into account
for federal student-aid funding,
especiallythe success of students

Appeal of ex-Guantanamo
detainee rejected by court

Man argues
constitutional
rights were violated
NEW YORK (AP) - In a
boost to U.S. efforts to gain
intelligence from terrorism
suspects before prosecuting
them, a federal appeals court on
Thursday upheld the conviction
of an ex-Guantanamo detainee
in the 1998 bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa.'
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals rejected arguments
that Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani's
long detention overseas by the
Central Intelligence Agency
violated his constitutional right
to a speedy trial, concluding
that he was properly convicted
and sentenced to life in prison
for his role in the attacks that
killed 224 people, including a
dozen Americans.
Ghailani's lawyer, Peter Qui-

jano, promised a Supreme Court
appeal.
The court seemed to embrace
an opportunity to say that evi-
dence necessary to prosecute in
U.S. civilian courts and the legal
rights of a defendant are not
necessarily spoiled by efforts to
obtain intelligence from terror-
ism suspects.
"This appeal presents a ques-
tion bound to arise from the
government's efforts to obtain
actionable and time-sensitive
intelligence necessary to thwart
acts of terror, while still bring-
ing those charged with commit-
ting crimes of terrorism against
Americans to justice in an
orderly fashion under the laws
of our coutry," Circuit Judge
Jose A. Cabranes wrote.
The three-judge panel con-
cluded Ghailani's right to a
speedy trial was not violated,
and it rejected his lawyers'
arguments that the government
may never bring a defendant

00 0

to trial after detaining him for
national security purposes.
Quijano, though, said in an
email statement that he never
argued that the government
could never bring a defendant
to trial after detaining him for
national security purposes.
"The government did not act
expeditiously to afford Ahmed
Ghailani a trial after subjecting
him to enhanced interrogation
techniques and then forcing
him to languish for years at
Guantanamo Bay," Quijano said.
"A claim of national security
does not and cannot suspend
and vitiate one's fundamental
right to a speedy trial. Here, a
delay of more than five years -
duringwhich the defendant was
tortured no extract information
- was constitutionally exces-
sive."
Last week, Abu Anas al-Libi,
also known as Nazih Abdul-
Hamed al-Ruqai, pleaded not
guilty to terrorism charges
when he was brought to a Man-
hattan courtroom after he was
snatched off the streets of Libya
and subjected to a week of ques-
tioning aboard an American
warship. He is charged in the
same embassy attacks. Republi-
cans in Congress have demand-
ed he be sent to the U.S. prison
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for
indefinite interrogation.
In supporting its conclusions
in the Ghailani case, the 2nd
Circuit noted that the Supreme
Court "has repeatedly held that
the government may purposely
delay trials for significant peri-
ods of time, so long as, on bal-
ance, the publics and private
interests render the delay rea-
sonable."
The court also rejected argu-
ments that Ghailani was preju-
diced for speedy trial purposes
by his treatment during his CIA
detention.
The Sixth Amendment's
speedy trial clause "protects
defendants against prejudice
caused by delays in their trials,
not against the harms of inter-
rogation," Cabranes wrote.

French President Francois Hollande gestures as he speaks to the media during an EU summit, Friday. European leaders

over U.S. spying allegations

French and German

denounce U.S.
actions
BRUSSELS (AP) - European
leaders united in anger Thurs-
day as they attended a.sum-
mit overshadowed by reports
of widespread U.S. spyihg on
its allies - allegations Ger-
man Chancellor Angela Merkel
said had shattered trust in the
Obama administration and
undermined the crucial trans-
Atlantic relationship.
The latest revelations that
the U.S. National Security
Agency swept up more than
70 million phone records in
France and may have tapped
Merkel's own cellphone
brought denunciations from
the French and German gov-
ernments.
Merkel's unusually stern
remarks as she arrived at the
European Union gathering
indicated she wasn't placated
by a phone conversation she

had Wednesday with President
Barack Obama, or his personal
assurances that the U.S. is not
listening in on her calls now.
"We need trust among allies
and partners," Merkel told
reporters in Brussels. "Such
trust now has to be built anew.
This is what we have to think
about."
"The United States of Amer-
ica and Europe face common
challenges. We are allies," the
German leader said. "But such
an alliance can only be built
on trust. That's why I repeat
again: spying among friends,
that cannot be."
The White House may soon
face other irked heads of state
and government. The British
newspaper The Guardian said
Thursday it obtained a confi-
dential memo suggesting the
NSA was able to monitor 35
world leaders' communica-
tions in 2006. The memo said
the NSA encouraged senior
officials at the White House,
Pentagon and other agencies to
share their contacts so the spy
agency could add foreign lead-
ers' phone numbers to its sur-

veillance systems, the report
said.
The Guardian did not iden-
tify who reportedly was eaves-
dropped on, but said the memo
termed the payoff very meager:
"Little reportable intelligence"
was obtained, it said.
Other European leaders
arriving for the 28-nation
meeting echoed Merkel's dis-
pleasure. Swedish Prime Min-
ister Fredrik Reinfeldt called it
"completely unacceptable" for
a country to eavesdrop on an
allied leader.
If reports that Merkel's
cellphone had been tapped
are true, "it is exceptionally
serious," Dutch Prime Minis-
ter Mark Rutte told national
broadcaster NOS.
"We want the truth," Ital-
ian Premier Enrico Letta told
reporters. "It is not in the least
bit conceivable that activity of
this type could be acceptable."
Echoing Merkel, Austria's
foreign minister, Michael
Spindelegger, said, "We need
to re-establish with the U.S. a
relationship of trust, which has
certainly suffered from this."

Nuclear talks with
Iran continue with
IAEA official
A top nuclear negotiator from
Tehran will meet with the head
of the U.N.'s nuclear agency next
week just hours before agency
experts sit down with Iranian
counterparts to renew their push
for access to sites, people and
documents believed linked to
possible work on atomic arms, the
agency said Thursday.
The talks between Internation-
al Atomic Energy Agency special-
ists and Iranian negotiators have
been set for nearly a month. But
Iran's decision to send Deputy
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi
was only announced Thursday.
Araghchi's mission in Vienna
was unclear, but he played a key
role in nuclear talks last week
with six world powers that nego-
tiators from both sides described
as encouraging after years of
inconclusive meetings. Those
talks in Geneva were focused

on limiting Iranian nuclear pro-
grams that can be used both to
generate power and make fissile
warhead material.

Saudi rights
activists call for
women to drive
It's been a little more than two
years since the last time women
in Saudi Arabia campaigned for
the right to drive. Now activ-
ists are calling for women to get
behind the wheel again Satur-
day, and they hope reforms made
by the monarchy since then have
readied the deeply conservative
nation for change.
The reforms made by King
Abdullah in recent years have
been cautious, showing his wari-
ness of pushing too hard against
influential ultraconservatives.
But given the overwhelming
restrictions on women in the
kingdom, where the strict inter-
pretation of Islam known as
Wahhabism is effectively the
law of the land, even the tiny
openings have had a resounding
effegt.
Perhaps one sign of the impact
of the changes is the loudness of
the backlash by conservatives
against Saturday's driving cam-
paign.

Thursday in New York City.
transit hub opens

Piece of the $4
billion project
officially opens
NEW YORK (AP) - The first
piece of a nearly $4 billion rede-
velopment of the World Trade
Center transportation hub
debuted Thursday with the offi-
cial opening of an underground
concourse that passes through
an area that has been closed
since 9/11.
The gleaming, marble-paved
expanse is expected to smooth
the way for tens of thousands
of commuters and visitors. It
ultimately will feature retail
outlets, but it offers something
new right now: A passageway
that links businesses and ferry
service to the west of the trade
center site to New Jersey-bound
PATH trains and the rest of
lower Manhattan to the east.
Prior to Sept. 11, pedestri-
ans used a bridge over heavily
traveled West Street. Since the
attacks destroyed the bridge,
they've used a temporary bridge
or crossed the streets at street
level. The temporary bridge is
being dismantled and is not in
use.
"The original World Trade
Center site eliminated the street
grid because that was the fash-
ion of the times," Port Author-
ity of New York and New Jersey

executive director Patrick Foye
said at Thursday's ribbon cut-
ting. "This restores that street
grid and adds an underground
grid that literally spans the
length of lower Manhattan."
Foye noted that designing
the $3.9 billion transportation
hub, scheduled to be completed
in 2015, provided the opportu-
nity for a "do-over" of sorts that
focuses more on linking mul-
tiple modes of transportation
than the original World Trade
Center site did.
The hub will connect the
PATH rail system, ferry service,
New York City subway lines and
the Fulton Street Transit Cen-
ter. Gone will be the days, Foye
said, of commuters having to
cross busy streets and trudge up
and down stairs to make transit
connections, Foye said.
The approximately 600-foot-
long underground concourse,
which features 40,000 square
feet of Italian marble, will house
stores and restaurants on two
levels, also by 2015. The Port
Authority is partnering with
Westfield Group to develop and
lease the more than 350,000
square feet of retail space.
Westfield had signed a long-
term retail deal with the Port
Authority not long before Sept.
11 and signed a new deal for the
redeveloped site in early 2008.
Other components of the
redeveloped World Trade Cen-

ter site will be rolled out over
the next several months.
The 72-story 4 World Trade
Center is scheduled to open next
month, and One World Trade
Center, once known as the Free-
dom Tower, is expected to have .
its official opening in early 2014.
The first new PATH rail plat-
form to replace the temporary
platforms that have been used
since Sept.11 should open by the
end of this year or early in 2014,
Steven Plate, World Trade Cen-
ter construction director, said.
. Yards from where hurry-
ing commuters passed through
the temporary PATH station
Thursday, workers continued
the construction of the massive,
800,000-square-foot transpor-
tation hub, whose dominant
feature will be an "oculus," two
wing-like sections of arches
separated by a huge skylight.
"To use a football anal-
ogy, we feel like we're on the
20-yard line and we're about to
punch it in," Plate said.
After two runs in Republi-
can gubernatorial primaries
and as the leader of successful
campaigns against ballot mea-
sures to raise a state sales tax
and fund stem-cell research,
Lonegan was a favorite of New
Jersey's relatively small right
wing.
The two candidates por-
trayed each other as too
extreme for the job.

Team members: City
was on edge weeks
before filing for
bankruptcy
DETROIT (AP) - Short of
cash, Detroit was delaying pay-
ments to vendors and "operating
on a razor's edge" weeks before it
filed for bankruptcy protection,
the head of the city's turnaround
team testified Thursday.
Ken Buckfire, a Wall Street
investment banker and Detroit-
area native, gave the most
detailed testimony so far on the
second day of a trial that will
determine whether the city can -
stay in bankruptcy court and
eventually unsaddle $18 billion
in debt.
Detroit must show it's broke

case should be thrown out.
Buckfire's firm, Miller Buck-
fire, got involved in Detroit's
finances before the bankruptcy.
He arrived in 2012 as the state
of Michigan signed an agree-
ment with the city to make cer-
tain changes in exchange for
financial support. The deal fell
apart and eventually led to the
appointment of an emergency

manager last March.
Buckfire said many city assets
were considered for possible sale
but none were viable, including
a small airport - "effectively
worth nothing" - and the water
department, which he described
as a "very complicated situa-
tion."
He said art is being appraised
at the Detroit Institute of Arts, a
museum that is operated on the
city's behalf
By last spring, there were esti-
mates that Detroit soon would
be down to just $7 million, a
small vein of cash in an annual
budget of more than $1 billion,
while payments to vendors were
repeatedly delayed, Buckfire
said.
"The city was operating on a
razor's edge of liquidity.... There
was nothing of significance that
could be converted to cash to
avert a cash crisis in June or
July," he said.
Emergency manager Kevyn
Orr, appointed by the Michi-
gan governor to run Detroit,
announced in June that the city
would stop making payments on
$2.5 billion in unsecured debt.
The Chapter9 bankruptcy filing
came a month later.
Lawyers opposed to the bank-
ruptcy asked that much of Buck-
fire's testimony be stricken. They
said he offered too much opinion
about finances that went beyond
the scope of his role in Detroit.

Gambians arrested for hosting
gay party' in violation of law

National Intelligence
Agency member
lurks at gathering
before accusation
DAKAR, Senegal (AP) - Alh-
aji, a 21-year-old gay man, knew
there was trouble when he heard
that an uninvited guest was
snapping photos in the middle
of his poolside birthday party in
Gambia's capital.
That photographer turned
out to be a member of Gambia's
feared National Intelligence
Agency, and accused Alhaji of
throwing "a gay party" in viola-
tion of Gambian law.
He and 17 other men were
taken into custody that night.
In the months that followed,
he said they were interrogated,
beaten and subjected to a very
public trial that destroyed their
reputations in a country where
President Yahya Jammeh has
called for sexual minorities tobe
decapitated.
As they were escorted from
the courtroom after their
acquittal, Alhaji heard someone
yell: "You think you're free, but
you're not. This is just the begin-
ning. When the law can't do any-
thing, we can do something."
Alhaji, a slight, soft-spoken
clothing vendor who insisted
that his full name be withheld
out of fear for his safety, fled
to neighboring Senegal where
he hoped to obtain refugee sta-
tus and then resettle in a third
country. More than a year later,
though, the Senegalese govern-
ment has made no progress on
his application, leaving him and
a dozen other gay Gambian men
stranded in a country where
homosexuality is also illegal
- and punishable by up to five
years in prison.

Rights workers advocating on
behalf of the would-be refugees
are calling for their cases to be
expedited. At the same time, Dji-
bril Balde, the Dakar-based rep-
resentative of the International
Refugee Rights Initiative, said
there was little hope for a posi-
tive outcome.
"I am fundamentally cer-
tain that these cases will be
rejected," he said. "People are
fundamentally hostile toward
gay-related issues. That's defi-
nitely clear."
Senegal's asylum office, the
National Commission of Eli-
gibility in Dakar, declined to
comment. The total number of
applications for refugee status
makes it impossible to ensure a
speedy process, said an official
at the commission who insisted
on anonymity because he was
not authorized to discuss its
work.
The commissionhas abacklog
of more than 2,000 refugee sta-
tus applications filed on all sorts
of grounds, meaning it is not just
homosexuals who are stuck in
limbo, said Mathijs Le Rutte,
regional representative for pro-
tection at the United Nations
refugee agency. But while most
refugee candidates from other
countries have removed them-
selves from immediate danger
simply by reaching Senegal, the
same cannot be said for homo-
sexuals.
Lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender, or LGBT, asylum
seekers are considered to be
among the most vulnerable in
Africa because of the high like-
lihood they will face discrimi-
nation in the countries where
they seek protection. In coun-
tries like Senegal, Kenya and
South Africa that receive a high
number of gay men and lesbians
hoping to obtain refugee status,
reports of ill-treatment by the


local population and indiffer-
ence from government officials
are common.
Abductions,' mob attacks
and rapes targeting gay asylum
seekers have been documented
in Kenya and Uganda - inci-
dents the victims had difficulty
reporting to police because of
their ambiguous legal status,
according to a May 2012 report
by Human Rights First.
"LGBT refugees face many of
the same challenges that other
refugees do, but in addition
they also face a range of other
challenges," said Eleanor Acer,
director of refugee protection
for Human Rights First. "In
some cases they're doubly mar-
ginalized."
Of the 38 African countries
that criminalize homosexuality,
Senegal and Gambia are among
the strictest enforcers. Since
2008, Senegal has been gripped
by what Human Rights Watch
describes as an anti-gay "moral
panic," with arrests and mob jus-
tice on the rise. In some towns,
the corpses of men presumed to
have been gay during their lives
have been dug from their graves
and dragged through the streets.
In Gambia, Jammeh has made
clear that gays are unwelcome,
saying repeatedly that any who
are found in the country would
"regret" being born.
For two weeks after the raid
on his birthday party, Alhaji says
he was kept in solitary confine-
ment in Banjul. Guards woke
him up each morningby dousing
him in cold water, then beat him
during interrogation sessions so
he would divulge the names of
other gay men and lesbians.
Police then searched Alhaji's
home for items that would con-
firm he was gay. He said all they
turned up were some boxer-
briefs, which they deemed "fem-
inine."


Nobel Peace Prize
laureate says youth
joblessness a
'time bomb'
BRUSSELS (AP) - As
Europe's leaders convened to
discuss the continent's mas-
sive unemployment problem, it
was a visitor this week, Nobel
Peace Prize laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi, who most eloquently
summed up what is at stake.
"Youth unemployment is a
time bomb" said the Myan-
mar opposition leader, who
held talks on how Europe could
help her country emerge from
decades of dictatorship.
In the EU, the world's big-
gest trade bloc, some 23.3 per-
cent - or 5.5 million - of those
under the age of 25 are jobless,
according to EU figures.
EU government leaders will
specifically address the issue
at their summit Thursday,
but there are few solutions in
sight due to countries' high
debt, a lack of funds, some-
times strict labor laws and a
reluctance among the young
to relocate.
The leaders took heart in
signs that the financial crisis
might have reached a bottom
- a timid return to economic
growth promises a pickup in
employment. But with jobless-
ness still near 11 percent, labor
unions were not convinced.
"Twenty-seven million
unemployed in Europe see no
light at the end of the tunnel,
only the light of a high speed
train ready to run them over,"
said Bernadette Segol, the chief
of the European Trade Union
Confederation.
Business federations want
to revive the jobs market by
making labor laws more flex-
ible and making it easier to hire
and fire at short notice. Unions
decry such moves, arguingthey
have spawned an increase in
short-term contracts and low
wages that leave households
uncertain about the future and
undermine Europe's vaunted
welfare state.
A pre-summit meeting
between labor and employ-
ers' federations yielded little
beyond agreeing to disagree.

EU leaders will later seek to
agree on an 8 billion-euro
($11 billion) package to allevi-
ate youth unemployment that
would kick in early -next year.
But for many that is too little,
too late.
"We need a much bigger
investment plan," Segol said.
The rise in unemployment is
worsening divisions within the
EU between mostly wealthy
countries in the north and the
needy in the south.
Germany's youth unemploy-
ment stood at only 7.7 percent
in August, whereas Spain's was
over 50 percent. In Greece, the
rate at last count in June was
even worse, at a staggering 61.5
percent.
As well as being a burden to
on public finances, high youth
unemployment has a long-term
impact on the labor force by
denying potential workers the
chance to learn valuable skills.
That degrades the, country's
future employment and growth
potential and has also fueled
social tensions.
EU president Herman
Van Rompuy said Thursday
that efforts should be geared
toward preparing workers for
the burgeoning information
and communication technolo-
gy sector. He estimated that by
2015, there would be 900,000
vacancies in those sectors.
"With unemployment still
so high, it is not hard to do the
math. This is where we need to
invest," he said.
Instead of going high-tech,
some nations embrace some-
thing as traditional as agricul-
ture.
In Portugal, a growing num-
ber of young people, including
graduates, have been returning
to the land to take up farming.
The government is encourag-
ing the trend and now offers
six-month paid training agri-
cultural courses for 6,000
people aged between 18 and 35.
The number of applicants for
such schemes rose to 8,000 in
2012 from just 1,000 in 2008.
Some 35 percent had higher
education.
Greece offers subsidies to
new farmers, and also provides
state-owned land at a nomi-
nal price, or even rent-free, to
under 35-year-olds who are
prepared to cultivate it.

No more NERD
Snyder's refusal to disclose donor names fails public obligation
Monday, Gov. Rick Snyder's press secretary Sara Wurfel
announced the impending dissolution of the controversial New
Energy to Reinvent and Diversify - or NERD - Fund. NERD is
considered to be a public state fund, but the revenue is generated by anon-
ymous, private donors. Since the NERD fund was created, it's been dis-
covered that some of the funds have been used frivolously, such as paying
for home improvements on Snyder's house. The ambiguity surrounding
the fund's donors and usage has created uproar from the public. Snyder's
consistent refusal to disclose donor names and explicitly state what the
funds were spent on infringes on the public's ability to participate in gov-
ernment affairs and breeds suspicion about the special interests of offi-

'm willing to bet that the
125-million Americans who
don't support federal fund-
ing for space
programs have
never met Colo-
nel Jack Lousma.
To hear the
distinguished
Michigan gradu-
ate, space shuttle
pilot and capsule JULIA
communicator ZARINA
of the Apollo 13
mission speak
about his 17
years as an astronaut is to forget for
a moment that you've never been
out of Earth's literal and figurative
sphere of influence.
The stories he told during our
interview were vivid reminders of
what inspired me and thousands
before me to live out childhood
afternoons in refrigerator box
spaceships big enough for tiny astro-
nauts with stars in their eyes. They
are what motivated dreams of space
camp and Tang-drinking orang-
utans in zero gravity.
Most importantly, his experienc-
es are critical reminders that space
exploration demands a continued
place in our curricula and political
agendas, not just in our history text-
books as a faint, retro-futuristic fad
of a bygone era.
Since the cancellation of the
Space Shuttle program two years
ago, the United States is at a crucial
crossroads in space research. In a
political climate that is unrecep-
tive to the financial costs associated
with a national space program, the
questions the country faces now are
different from the ones at the begin-
ning of the Space Race - funding
and support, more than technologi-
cal capabilities, are now the limit-
ing factors to space exploration.
Although societal trends dictating
the use of such technologies have
changed drastically in the past 60
years, space exploration today is
as important as ever for both the
immediate and long-term futures of
innovation and research.
One of the most visible changes
in space research is the introduc-
tion of commercial companies in an
area that had previously been the
exclusive jurisdiction of regulated
government initiatives. Businesses
like SpaceX and. Orbital Sciences
have proven themselves to be suc-
cessful, profitable partners in logis-

tical roles associated with space
exploration - such as delivering
cargo to the International Space
Station - and show potential for
great growth in developing manned
commercial spaceflight programs
in the near future.
While commercial space compa-
nies will undoubtedly play a role of
increasing importance in the future
of space exploration, it is premature
to say that we are past the era of
government-funded space programs
being necessary or useful. As Lous-
ma emphasizes, the goals and most
important functions of NASA as an
organization relate to exploration
and discovery, although their mis-
sion in recent years seemed analo-
gous at times to running a kind of
extraterrestrial airline to and from
the International Space Station.
"I think it's unlikely that the
commercial sector will eventually.
take over (activities like) deep space
exploration," Lousma says. "It's too
costly, takes too much time and I'm
guessing it will be an international
effort when it does get underway
... It's what NASA would like to do.
The resources required and the
startup cost of it is going to dictate
that the federal government do this
kind of research."
Opponents argue that funding for
space programs wastes money when
there are widespread fiscal crises on
Earth, and that the motivations that
drove the United States to develop
the world's most advanced space
program are no longer as relevant
as they were during the days of Cold
War rivalry. Although dominance in
space exploration may not be at the
forefront of our national security
interests anymore, the continued
support of these programs is both
an economic asset and a social and
scientific necessity.
Besides the positive economic
returns associated with investing in
space research, the avet'age Ameri-
can benefits from these govern-
ment-funded programs in tangible
ways. Lousma points out that the
benefits of space research have rel-
evant mainstream applications and
can be impossible to predict.
"Things we never thought might
spin-off (from space research) are
the things we have now: comput-
ers, in every house, GPS systems,
Internet, cell phones. A whole lot
of things like that are spinoffs of
space technology and are prod-
ucts that nobody ever thought of,"

Lousma says.
"I think our greatest benefit is
probably unknown at the moment."
This idea may appeal to policy-
makers like Jack Marburger, former
presidential science advisor, who
was once quoted as saying the debate
about space exploration "comes
down to whether we want to bring
the solar system within mankind's
sphere of economic influence".
Although this may be true when
it comes to debating the national
budget, the real, compelling rea-
sons space exploration matters are
not found in the numbers. We study
finance and government to be mas-
ters of our own systems, but the
challenge of exploring something
unknown for its own sake is what
makes us uniquely human. We are
compelled to write symphonies,
climb mountains and break records
not because it will make us rich, but
because it will make us better col-
lectively and as individuals.
"There are no grocery stores
or gas stations in space," Lousma
remarks. "You have to learn to con-
serve your supplies and get along
because you're on a mission that is
important, is risky and has conse-
quences. In the same way, we're on a
spacecrafthere;welive onthe space-
craft Earth. It's flying through space
at tremendous speed and we need
to learn to use our resources more
effectively and efficiently and learn
to get along with each other better
than we have in the past in order to
have a safe and successful mission."
To purposefully examine and
promote these ideas is to contrib-
ute to history and our own under-
standing in a profound and almost
super-human way - it's impossible
to quantify what is perhaps the most
under-valued benefit of space explo-
ration: the generations of scientists,
astronauts, engineers and students
who have been inspired to innovate
and explore because of it.
"You'll always find things that
haven't been done before," Lousma
says in support of those pursu-
ing careers in space research. "It's
being a part of something that's big-
ger than yourself. And you'll find
that when it's risky, there's a lot of
reward in winning."
This isthereal reasonspaceexplo-
ration matters. The rewards are out
there; it's up to us to go get them.

cials and private organizations. .
A play upon the governor's "One tough
nerd" slogan, the NERD fund was established
in 2011 to relieve the taxpayers of the burden
of paying for specific government expendi-
tures such as technology and event outreach.
Although the nonprofit was well-intentioned
and Snyder and board members assure it obeys
all tax and election laws, its aura of secrecy
rightfully disturbs Michigan citizens. Recipi-
ents of the money from this "social welfare
program" include Rich Baird, Snyder's friend
and top adviser, and Kevyn Orr, the appointed
emergency manager of Detroit.
Michigan citizens can't pinpoint who
donated the money or exactly how the
grossed $1.6 million was spent on "social wel-
fare." However, a major portion of NERD's
scrutiny stems from the money spent on pay-
ing the monthly $4,200 for Orr's condomin-
ium at Westin Book Cadillac and his travel
expenses. Likewise, NERD supplied Baird's
$100,000 annual salary and paid for furni-
ture in state-owned residences that Snyder,
uses. Other suspiciously vague expenses out-
lined in the non-profit's 2012 tax form include
- $411,917 for "charitable causes," $13,157
"to support public policies" and $173,630 for
travel in general.

NERD's status as a 501(c)(4) organization
allows for donor anonymity, and Snyder's
spokeswoman implied the donors won't be
disclosed due to the pretense that their con-
tributions would stay anonymous. When
questioned about the identities of these pri-
vate contributors, Snyder explained that
the board operates independent of him, and
therefore he does not know who donated.
Yet, the directors of the board include indi-
viduals who assisted in his 2010 election. The
lack of transparency in the inner workings
of the NERD fund prioritizes wealthy inves-
tors who can furnish extravagant lifestyles of
government officials over the people's right
to know how government funds are spent and
who truly is influencing state politics.
The public is the only entity who should
benefit from public funds - not Snyder him-
self or his political allies. Wurfel acknowl-
edged the dissolution of NERD will be
followed with a more "transparent fund that
will go far beyond what the law requires."
Spending and donor names will be posted
online on a regular basis, but these small
amendments will not erase the suspicions
and criticisms lurking within the minds of
the public after three years of secrecy.

EMILY GEISTER-DANVILLE I
Self-har
Sara felt unsure and afraid while she was
an undergraduate at the University. She cut
long slits into her thighs to relieve the stress
and anxiety, but instead of feeling better, she
felt more alone. She didn't know where to get
help and was afraid of being misunderstood.
Sara's story is a common one. Self-harm is
widely considered to be a growing problem
among adolescents, young adults and col-
lege students. Self-harm is the intentional
destruction of body tissue without the intent
to die. Like Sara, those who self-harm rarely
seek treatment. They are afraid of being insti-
tutionalized, marginalized and demonized.
Self-harming people have been treated poor-
ly by healthcare professionals due to a lack of
understanding and knowledge. This lapse in
treatment must be addressed at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. The Counseling and Psy-
chological Services administration must add
information to its webpage about self-harm
and its treatment, as well as developing the
University's philosophy on how self-harming
individuals will be treated.
CAPS does not list any specific treatment
or information about self-harm. Having
access to information regarding how self-
harm behavior is treated and understood is
important when trying to provide for those
who participate in this stigmatized behavior.
A multitude of descriptive pages on the CAPS
website exist. These pages include informa-
tion regarding the help groups available and a
variety of treatment philosophies. Depression,
anxiety, suicide, eating disorders, substance
use, sexuality and racial issues are addressed -
CAPS offers information as well as a variety of
treatment options. Even with the wide range of
present topics, self-harm is excluded.
Providing specific information will help
self-harming individuals feel more com-
fortable and welcomed at CAPS. A study by
researchers Michelmore and Hindley in 2012
found that self-harming individuals are less
likely to seek help than their non-harming
peers with other mental health issues. A 2009
study found that self-harming behavior pre-
dicted poorer school performance and higher
rates of suicidal thoughts. These facts amplify
the necessity to have comprehensive informa-

m stigma

tion to persuade students to seek treatment.
The DSM V - the latest edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Health Disorders - acknowledges self-harm
as a separate condition prevalent in mid- to
late-adolescence and continuing to reach its
peak in both severity and frequency during
a person's 20s. A study by researchers Whit-
lock, Eckenrode and Silverman revealed that
nearly 17 percent of undergraduate and grad-
uate students reported harming themselves.
Self-harm is a complex issue that should
have its own University webpage. This would
allow students to seek more information and
assuage their anxieties about treatment. On
this page, there should be a list of philoso-
phies about self-harm. This will provide self-
harming individuals with an idea of how the
counselors view their behavior. Specifically,
the University should use Deb Martinson's
1998 Bill of Rights for People Who Self-Harm,
in which Martinson delineates ten main val-
ues that guide self-harm treatment.
The self-harm specific CAPS webpage
should also display information on available
groups that address self-harm. If a group
specifically addressing self-harm doesn't
already exist, CAPS should establish one.
Targeted groups foster a sense of community
and aid in reducing the isolation, shame and
stigma around self-harm. Lastly, this page
should provide emergency contacts - such as
800-DONTCUT - where students can seek
self-harm-specific support.
Adding information and philosophies
of treatment for self-harm to the webpage
would be an effective and inexpensive way to
reach self-harming students. If changes are
not made, rates of self-harm will most likely
continue to rise. Students may continue to
feel unsure of counseling services and there-
fore won't seek help, possibly putting their
lives and academic careers at risk. Adding a
category of self-harm to the CAPS website
could change the future for many students
who have felt their mental health concerns
do not have a place on campus.

Is this the end of unpaid internships?

ike many of my fellow
seniors, I have been spend-
ing my few hours in-between
studying for
midterms and
pretending
to still have a
social life try-
ing to line up a
post-graduation
internship or
entry-level job.
Unfortunately, TIMOTHY
for more than a BURROUGHS
few students this
includes consid-
ering the dreaded unpaid intern-
ship, where experience and perhaps
a few academic credits replace a
paycheck. However, these positions
could be a thing of the past as indus-
tries that have relied on the grunt
work of unpaid interns for years are
reconsidering their payroll practic-
es. Last summer, a Federal District
Court of Manhattan ruled that Fox
Searchlight Pictures unlawfully did
not pay two interns who worked on
the production of the movie "Black
Swan". This decision is a strong
argument against the legal loophole
that allows job training to replace
wages in some instances.
The first major effect of the
"Black Swan" case was felt Wednes-
day as Cond6 Nast announced they
were cutting their entire internship
program asa result of a pending law-
suit against them. Cond6 Nast is a
publications company that produces
Vanity Fair, Vogue, The New Yorker
and various other magazines. Cur-
rent interns will not be affected by
the change and will work through
their previously established end
dates. Additionally, there's yet to be
an announcement about any new
entry-level or paid internship posi-
tions to fill the void left by the pro-

gram's end.
Last summer's "Black Swan"
decision brought validation and
substance to much of the criticism
against unpaid internships. In many
programs, the facade of valuable
work experience and training has
been completely debunked as work
days are filled with menial tasks
and little interaction with industry
professionals. In these instances, it
seems fairly obvious that compensa-
tion is deserved. Furthermore, many
critics of unpaid programs claim
that these internships aren't acces-
sible to lower-income individuals
who are unable to cover costs while
working long hours with no income.
Though many young professionals
have accepted unpaid internships as
a necessary evil to the start of one's
career, the "Black Swan" decision
represents the first major legal vic-
tory against these programs.
While the initial reception to the
decision from young profession-
als was very positive, the reaction
of Conde Nast could be a sobering
sign of things to come. Industries,
most notably media 'and publica-
tions companies, have begun to rely
on this low-cost labor and are cur-
rently not structured to offer their
many interns competitive wages.
Many see this as big companies
taking advantage of the competi-
tive nature of new hire programs
- which required extensive work
experience - and forcing students
to accept these unpaid positions.
In practice, these positions offer
the 'foot-in-the-door' experience to
numerous students and frequently
end with letters of recommendation,
a stronger professional network or
ideally a job offer.
By forcing companies to pay all
interns, firms, at a minimum, will
have to cut back the number of posi-

tions offered and select individu-
als even more carefully - limiting
opportunities even further. Alter-
natively, companies such as Conde
Nast may decide to completely scrap
internship programs entirely and
potentially replace their efforts with
new entry level jobs. Unfortunately,
those positions, especially when
paid competitively, attract more
qualified individuals, including
those looking for a potential career
change. Those established profes-
sionals can crowd outnew graduates
who are still looking for their first
major opportunity and trying to dis-
cover their future career. Though an
unpaid internship is far from ideal,
candidates are made well aware of
the compensation offered during the
application process and can decide
for themselves if the costs are worth
the potential benefits to their career.
Eliminating or forcing companies to
pay interns could potentially result
in a major increase in applicants,
including overqualified applicants,
to these already competitive jobs.
While the effects of the "Black
Swan" decision have only started,
the battle against unpaid intern-
ships is clearly gaining momentum.
Though critics argue that unpaid
internships represent a significant
cost to participants, the reaction
of Conde Nast illustrates how their
remedy could eliminate early career
opportunities even further. Ideally,
the "Black Swan" decision would
result in all interns' receiving pay
without a change in the quantity of
openings to college graduates, but
this appears far from reality. In a
super-competitive job market, any-
thing that amplifies this issue is bad
for young professionals.

her own abortion is to make oth-
ers feel safe enough to talk about
their own.

"I feel like what's important
about story sharing is that you
should be able to say your truth,
have your audience accept it, and
have them be comfortable enough
to share their truth," Stack said.
After Stacks's monologue,
women were given time to dis-
cuss their own abortions with
the audience. Five women told
stories, including several on the
Advocacy for Youth website that
were read by Students for Choice
members.I
Initially, Stack worried that a
safe environment wouldn't exist

United Students Against Sweat-
shops, North America's largest
student-run campaign organiza-
tion, organized the vigil along
with other student organiza-
tions, including the Bengali Stu-
dent Association, Canterbury
House and the Sikh Student
Association.
The goal of the vigil was
to empower the University
to help prevent future disas-
ters and demand that apparel
brands, such as Adidas, sign
the accord.
LSA senior Allysha Choud-
hury, a member of the Bengali
Student Association, suggested
that anti-sweatshop activism at

the University could influence
other universities to take a stand
as well.
"Once the University of
Michigan pushes this, other
universities might do the same,"
Choudhury said.
Most of the University's
apparel is licensed by Adidas,
which has manufacturing facili-
ties in Bangladesh. Most stu-
dents purchase their Maize and
Blue apparel without realizing
where it was made.
LSA sophomore Ryne Men-
hennick, a USAS member, said
consumers need to keep in mind
that the employees who make
their clothes are often suffering
in harsh factory conditions.
"We wear our own clothing
without thinking about who
made them," Menhennick said.

"What this brings us is a great
aspect for team-building," Naval
ROTC Capt. Joe Evans, chair of
the University's Naval Officer

ing that the exercise taught stu-
dent cadets how to apply their,
strengths within the team.
Carver now owns Bayo-
net CrossFit, a gym in Shel-
by Township, Mich., and
frequently runs similar train-
ing workouts on Saturdays.
Three Bayonet staff members

were on hand Thursday to help
coordinate and organize the
cadets.
Since students weren't given
information about what the
trfning would involve, Carver
sAid it made it more realistic for
careers in the armed services.
"If you know what you're
doing you can be mentally pre-

pared for it - (but) if you just
show up, it's a kick in the teeth,"
Carver said. "In a year to i6.ur
years, they are going to be lead-
ing soldiers in combat, so this
gives them a different perspec-
tive of how hard it could become,
and, as future leaders, what is
going to be demanded of them in
that role."

the federal government needs a

how they relate to women and

Nadasen said conservative
think tanks help to perpetuate
terms such as "food stamp fraud"
and "welfare cheat." She argued
that these pejorative terms are
used to enable incorrect notions

"Gone is that economy of a
quarter-century ago where a#
worker with a high school cre-
dential could make at least half
of what a college graduate would
earn," Rodriguez said.
Though a college degree may
be important in today's society,
Rodriguez said the nation's high-
er education system is nowhere
near perfect.
"Tuition and fees at our public
four-year colleges is now more
than three times higher than it

was thirty years ago, and over
this same period income has only
risen 16 percent for middle class
families," Rodriguez said, adding.
that the average college student
today accumulates more than
$26,000 of debt by graduation.
The Obama administration's
postsecondary education plan,
the 2020 College Attainment,
Goal, calls for the United States
to have the highest proportion
of college graduates in the world
by the end of the decade. Rodri-
guez said in an interview after

his address that the United States
is currently sixteenth in world
rankings, a fact thathas been pre-
viously cited by U.S. Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan.
Rodriguez also commended
the University for holding down
tuition increases for this aca-
demic year, saying it was thanks
in part to the state's commitment
to support higher education. The
University's Board of Regents
approved a 1.1-percent increase
in tuition this year, the lowest in
more than a decade.


en said. Fraud wastes only about
1 percent of the program's funds,
but public backlash against wel-
fare fraud has had profoundly
detrimental effects for the wel-
fare system.
"Although the outcry about
fraud is not based in reality, the,
political discourse about fraud
serves a purpose," Nadasen said.
It justifies cutback; it taints gov-
ernment programs as corrupt,
and it stigmatizes receipts of pub-
lic assistance."
Nadasen added that one of the
crucial developments during the
welfare rights movement was the
evolution of feminist conscious-
ness.
"It was through the process of
building a movement that came

to espouse a distinctive brand of
feminism," Nadasen said. "This
combined an analysis of race,
class, gender, sexuality and social-
welfare policy," Nadasen said.
In an interview before her
address, Nadasen said that her
passion for studying welfare was
sparked during her time as an,
undergraduate, when she was'
involved in anti-Apartheid and
anti-racist organizations on cam-
pus.
"It was at Michigan that I
found my passion for social jus-
tice, my interest in feminism and
my interest in issues of race,"
Nadasen said. "I have a very spe-
cial place in my heart for Michi-
gan, and I think it's an important
institution for people engaging in,

political activism and speaking
about the bigger world around
them."
Heidi Bennett, special events
planner for the Institute of
Research on Women and Gender,
said Nadasen's work on welfare
exemplified the institute's theme
semester on poverty and inequal-
ity.
Bennett said the last time the.
U.S. government fully directed]
its attention at combating poverty
was President Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society programs, which
he announced at the University
in 1964.
"It's a relevant time to look and
see what has changed what has
gotten better and how far wehave
to go."

National Guardsman
wounds two soldiers
before being subdued
MILLINGTON, Tenn. (AP)
- A member of the National
Guard opened fire at an armory
outside a U.S. Navy base in Ten-
nessee, wounding two soldiers
before being subdued and dis-
armed by other soldiers, officials
said Thursday.
Millington Police Chief Rita
Stanback said the shooter was
apprehended 'Thursday by other
National Guard members, and
that he did not have the small
handgun used in the shooting in
his possession by the time offi-
cers arrived. Stanback said two
National Guard members were
shot, one in the foot and one in
the leg.
"I'm sure there could have
been more injury if they hadn't
taken him into custody," Stan-
back said.
Maj. Gen. Max Haston, Ten-
nessee's adjutant general, said
at a news conference that the
victims were being treated at a
local hospital and he expected
them to be released.
The Tennessee National
Guard late Thursday identified
those shot as Maj. William J.
Crawford and Sgt. Maj. Ricky R.
McKenzie. The shooter's name
has not been released.
In a news release, Guard
spokesman Randy Harris said
the two were shot while disarm-
ing the gunman.
Haston said all three of the
men were recruiters. lie said
the shooter was a sergeant first
class who had been in the Guard
about six or seven years and that
the victims were his superiors.
He said the recruiters who were
shot were based in Jackson,
Tenn.
Haston characterized Thurs-
day's activity as disheartening.

"You never think something
like this is going to happen on
your watch or in good old Ten-
nessee here," he said.
Stanback said at an ear-
lier news conference that the
soldiers' conditions were not
immediately known, though the
Navy said on its official Twitter
account that neither had life-
threatening injuries.
The shooter was a recruiter
who had been relieved of duty,
said a law enforcement official
briefed on the developments.
The official was not authorized
to discuss the investigation pub-
licly and spoke on condition of
anonymity.
Asked about this at the news
conference, Hastln would only
say that there were "adminis-
trative policies and procedures
that we were going through
with him." He did not elabo-
rate.
Stanback said the shooting
happened inside an armory
building just outside Naval
Support Activity Mid-South.
There are more than 7,500
military, civilian and contract
personnel working on the
base, according to the facility's
official website. The facility
is home to human resources
operations and serves as head-
quarters to the Navy Personnel
Command, Navy Recruiting
Command, the Navy Manpow-
er Analysis Center and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Finance Center.
The Navy said the base was
briefly placed on lockdown as
a precaution, though the lock-
down was lifted in the after-
noon.
On 'Thursday afternoon, yel-
low crime scene tape remained
around the front of the building
where the shooting happened.
Law enforcement had blocked
off streets with access to the
armory, which is across the
street fromithe army base.

Explosion injures 40, kills one

Candy factory
leads to building
collapse in Mexico
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico
(AP) - An explosion inside a
candy factory in the border city
of Ciudad Juarez on Thursday
left one person dead and at least
40 injured, Mexican authorities
said.
The blast took place on the
second floor of the Dulces Blue-
berry factory and caused the

floor to collapse, injuring people
working downstairs, said fac-
tory worker Ismael Bouchet.
"I was able to help five people
who walked out of the building
but as soon as they were out they
went into shock and fainted," he
said outside the factory, which
produces gummy bears, jelly
beans, peach rings and other
sweets.
Authorities said the cause
of the blast hadn't been deter-
mined but Bouchet said a steam
boiler had been installed recent-
ly in the area.
Ciudad Juarez Civil Protec-

tion Director Fernando Mota
said firefighters found a body
inside and that six of the at least
40 injured are in serious condi-
tion. Several workers are miss-
ing and could be trapped inside"
the building, he added.
Firefighters and rescue crews
continued to search the build-
ing for more victims Thursday,
night.
Bouchet said people could
smell acid in the area where the,
explosion occurred.
"Since the morning, several
co-workers said there was a bad"
smell, that it smelled of acid and-

because it was a new area we
thought it was normal," Bouchet
said.
Photographs of workers
being helped by paramed-
ics showed people with inju-
ries that resembled chemical
burns.
Dulces Blueberry employs 300
people and the candy is sent to
a distributor based in El Paso,
Texas, which lies across the bor-
der from Ciudad Juarez.
Ciudad Juarez is a manufac-
turing hub and the assembly,
plants there employ many of its
residents.

'Shadow government forms in Libya

Division of country
could occur in
aftermath of uprising
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - The
leaders of a movement for self-
rule in oil-rich eastern Libyan
unilaterally announced Thurs-
day the formation of a shadow
government, the latest challenge
to the weakened central author-
ity. '
The announcement came sev-
eral months after the movement,
backed by some militias and local
tribes, declared the eastern half
of Libya to be an autonomous
state, named Barqa, claiming
broad self-rule powers and con-
trol over resources.
The central government ,in
Tripoli had rejected the declara-
tion. It had no immediate com-
ments on Thursday.
Advocates of the self-rule
in the east, who long has com-
plained about discrimination by
the government in the capital
Tripoli, have been pushing for
the reviving the system main-
tained under King Idris in 1951.

Libya then was divided into
three states, with Cyrenaica - or
Barqa, as it was called in Arabic
- encompassing the eastern half
of the country.
Opponents fear a declaration
of autonomy could be the first
step toward the outright division
of the country, particularly with
the turmoil that struck in the
aftermath of the fall of longtime
dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
The tension between the cen-
tral government and eastern
militias and tribal leaders has
already disrupted the exports
of oil. Eastern militias earlier
seized control of oil exporting
terminals, sending production
plunging from 1.4 million barrels
a day to around 600,000, robbing
the country of its main revenue
source.
Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi, the
head of the newly declared Barqa.
government, said the aim is to
improve distribution of resourc-
es and undermine the hold of the
centralized system that has dis-
criminated against their region.
"The aim of the regional gov-
ernment is to share resources in
a better fashion, and to end the'

centralized system adopted by'
the authorities in Tripoli," al-
Barassi said at a news conference.
in the northeastern town of Ajd-'
abiya.
He dismissed accusations that
the movement's leaders are only.
seeking to take control of the
region's oil resources. "We only
want Barqa's share according to,
the 1951 constitution," he said.
The new government is
made up of 24 posts, which
don't include the defense or
foreign affairs portfolios, he
said. Al-Barassi said the region,
will encompass four provinces,
includingBenghazi, Tobruk, Ajd-
abiya and Jebel Akhdar.
Since Gadhafi's ouster follow-
ing months of civil war, Libya,
has been beset by lawlessness
as the numerous armed men
who fought against the longtime
leader's forces formed into inde-
pendent militias now vying for
power and allying with compet-
ing politicians.
"The security file will be pri-
ority," Al-Barassi said. "It is a
thorny issue leading to the chaos
of illegitimate militias."
It is not clear how much sup-

portthenewautonomousgovern-
ment will have in the country's
east, though the movement's
leaders have seized control of
important resources. Officials
in the central government have
threatened to use military action
against any illegaLor unauthor-
ized shipment of oils.
Meanwhile, a Libyan court
on Thursday referred Gadhafi's
son and more than 30 others to
trial before a higher tribunal on
charges ranging from murder to
treason during the 2011 uprising,
a senior prosecutor said.
Prosecutor Al-Seddik al-Sur
said the Tripoli court also decid-
ed to appoint defense lawyers for
Gadhafi's son, Seif al-Islam, and
the late dictator's intelligence
chief, Abdullah al-Senoussi. He
did not announce a date for the
trial before the Criminal Court.
Al-Senoussi and al-Baghdadi
al-Mahmoudi, Gadhafi's last
prime minister, were among
about 10 of the 38 Gadhafi-era
officials to attend the hearing.
Seif al-Islam, held by a militia
group that captured him as he
attempted to flee to neighboring
Niger in 2011, was not present.

'Manganiyar' to
highlight traditions

Roysten Abel's


project to come to
Power Center
By LENA FINKEL
Daily Arts Writer
It's a whole new world full of
lights, movement and intoxicat-
ing music. A concept all its own,
"The Man-
ganiyar Seduc- Manganiyar
tion" hopes to $Wucion
transport audi-
ence members Saturday at

of the Indian
musicians, the Power Center
Manganiars, From $18
meet the bright
visuals of
Amsterdam's red light district.
The Manganiars are typically
classified as Sufi folk musicians.
But "Manganiyar Seduction"
creator Roysten Abel winced at.
the "folk" label.
"This folk thing is ques-
tionable. Of course, they have
been put in this (category), but
I would call them traditional
musicians," said Abel. "'Their
music goes back many thou-
sands of years."
Though not a Manganiar

himself, Abel has become quite
knowledgeable about the group,
having been introduced to their
music long before creating the
"Seduction."
"I was working on another
play (in Spain) with a lot of
traditional street performers,
musicians, acrobats, puppeteers
and snake charmers," Abel said.
"But we needed more musi-
cians."
The two musicians he found
happened to be Manganiars.
"One day I was sleeping and
in my dream, I could hear this
beautiful music. When I woke
up, there were the musicians,"
Abel said. "It became a tradition
for them to sit outside my room
and wake me up."
From then on, he was hooked.
"For me, they did not just
impact me on an emotional
level; it was also on a physical
level. That's when I realized
something fantastic had hap-
pened."
It's just this kind of magic
that Abel hopes to capture for
an audience. So, he went off to
Rajasthan, India, where the
Manganiar community resides,
and interviewed nearly a hun-
dred musicians for the perfor-
mance.
"All I did was listen to their
whole repertoire," Abel said.
"You start picking a score from

what they have already."
He explained that he wanted
to stick to the traditional music
and didn't try to alter their
songs in any way.
"I don't compose music.
Whatever the musicians have, I
arrange (it) like a theater piece."
The result was unlike any-
thing that had ever been done
before. The musicians, all 43 of
them, sit in cubicles surrounded
by red lights that illuminate
throughout the show.
The Manganiars are unable
to see one another, so the group
is led by a conductor, who danc-
es across the stage.
While the finished perfor-
mance is quite spectacular, the
whole process of organizing the
Manganiars wasn't without a
few bumps in the road.
As far the as the musicians
are concerned, "the problem
is, if you ask them to play a
whole songthey'll do it. But the
moment you ask them to play
one bar, it freaks them out. They
are not used to structure," Abel
said.
Overall, the process took
Abel about a year and a half,
but it seems to have paid off.
"The Manganiyar Seduction"
has toured all over the world
- from the U.K., to Singapore,
to New Zealand - and has
received critical acclaim.

"You want me to get on the wrecking ball?"
Gucci Mane needs to
save himself from spiral

By KEN SELANDER
For the Daily
Recently, Miley Cyrus has
been gracing the pages of nearly
every magazine and online news
source. It's not because of the so-
called "music" she's putting out
- like the so-stoned-I'm-tone-
deaf sound of "We Can't Stop" -
but primarily for her seemingly
slow, painful, downward spiral in
which she has transformed from
sweet and corny Hannah Mon-
tana into the druggy, slutty and
forced fagade dubbed "Miley."
The popularity of this one-time
face-of-Disney over the last
six months has overshadowed
the sparsely covered long-term
events that portray a decaying
and endangered Gucci Mane.
The beginning of the end for
Gucci can be traced back to his
disagreement with Young Jeezy
over the rights to their hit track
"Icy" in 2005. Gucci Mane pub-
lished the song on his album Trap
House without informing Jeezy,
who believed he was entitled
to royalties that he supposedly
never received.
Later that year an attempt
was made to rob Gucci at night.
In true gangster form, Gucci
whipped out a pistol and shot

ber how, only a year after "The
Hunger Games" debuted, Law-

She rocketed from obscurity to
stardom in an incredibly short
amount of time.
At this time next year, the fan-

heights. Mark my words: Though
many don't recognize the name
now, soon people will be utterly
maniacal about her. I'm talking
Buzzfeed .gif-articles, a catchy
nickname, millions hoping that
she's single - the whole shebang.
It's clear from the big splash-
es Woodley has been making
recently that fame is imminent.
She's slated to star next June in
"The Fault in Our Stars," beating
out 200 other auditioners for the
coveted role. She also landed the
main role for "Divergent," anoth-
er majorly hyped film coming out
next year. Both movies are based
off of high-profile bestsellers
many teens are fanatical about.
There's no question that Woodley
will cement her status as a favor-
ite among the younger popula-
tion. If there is any fanbase that
can really launch an actress in
spotlight, it's the Young Adult
section of Barnes & Noble - as
proven by the classic examples of
"The Hunger Games," "Twilight"
and "Harry Potter" series.
Some may worry that ifher act-
ing isn't on par, Woodley will ruin
any chances of rising to the top.
However, her previous record
has shown her genuine ability to
seize a role and make it her own.
This past summer, she co-starred
in "The Spectacular Now" and

McGary still day-to-day

Wolverines in close
battle for 1st in BIG

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
During last season's NCAA
Tournament, Michigan then-
freshman forward Mitch McGary
was the talk of the nation as -he
averaged a double-double of 14.3
points and 10.8 rebounds during
the men's basketball team's run to
the national championship game.
On Thursday, though, at Michi-
gan men's basketball media day,
he was at the center of attention
not for his on-court performance,
but for his current battle to get
back on the court.
Since late September, McGary
has been sidelined day-to-day
with a lower back injury, and
while Michigan coach John
Beilein didn't sound worried
in the long-term sense about
McGary, it remains unclear when
he will get back on the court.
"He's making great progress,"
Beilein said. "We're (being) super
cautious. He's been doing these
underwater treadmill workouts
that are really productive.... It's
still day-to-day. One of these days,
he's going to have to get out there
and see what he can do. But we're
very cautious."
When asked by reporters
about a possible target date for
McGary's return to practice, both
Beilein and McGary lacked an
answer.
"There's no target date or any-
thing right now," McGary said.
"Like I said, I'm day-to-day right
now. (But I'm) feeling really good
about my body and whatnot."
Besides McGary, no other Wol-
verines are currently injured.
However, Beilein did say a simi-
larly cautious approach was taken
with freshman guard Derrick
Walton Jr., who injured his foot in
recent weeks.
"Derrick is 100 percent, or at
least he has been in practice,"
Beilein said. "He missed about
four or five days just when we

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Sophomore forwards Glenn Robinson IIl and Mitch McGary are being counted on to continue Michigan's recent sucess.

made sure his foot was fine."
STRETCHING THE FLOOR: As
recently as two years ago, Michi-
gan was using a four-guard line-
up for the majority of its games.
Packaged with fifth-year senior
Jordan Morgan, the Wolverine
lineup was incredibly small.
That won't be the issue this
year.
Currently, Michigan houses 10
players that stand at least 6-foot-
6. With such height, Beilein
envisions a plethora of possible
lineups.
At the moment, Beilein admits
the team is not as versatile as it
can be, but after McGary recovers
from his lower back issue, he will
be spoiled for choices.
"With Mitch not being in there
right now, we're not as versatile as
we would like to be," Beilein said.
"We want to have people playing a
lot of different positions.... When
Mitch is healthy, we're fairly ver-
satile where we can play a bunch
of multi-position players and just
let it roll."

With sophomore guards Nik
Stauskas and Caris LeVert each
standing at 6-foot-6, the range of
their play could come in a variety
of ways.
With one weighing over 200
pounds - Stauskas, and one under
- LeVert, Beilein sees the duo
playing a "lot of positions."
"I think Nik and Caris can both
really play a big guard," Beilein
said. "Both are two-position play-
ers. Caris can probably play guard
and Nik can play what he played
(last season) and play the off-
guard."
Speaking further on the con-
cept of LeVert playing point
guard, Beilein went as far as to say
that Michigan "could go out there
with a 6-6, 6-6, 6-6, 6-6 and a big
guy" with the four 6-foot-6 play-
ers being LeVert, Stauskas, sopho-
more forward Glen Robinson III
and freshman Zak Irvin.
INTANGIBLES: When asked in
his press conference what was the
biggest challenge that Michigan
will face this year, Beilein was

quick to answer.
"I think the biggest (challenge)
is replacing the intangibles we
had off those five seniors that left
this team and won a lot of games
in their time," Beilein said. "There
were things going on in the locker
room, in the practice and in the
weight room (and) meals that you
(can) hardly replace."
Senior leadership won't be the
only thing that the Wolverines
will have to replace this season.
Another thing will be the pro-
duction of former Wolverines
Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway
Jr. With his two biggest scoring
threats and late-game options no
longer present, Beilein is already
questioning who exactly will fill
their spaces, especially with the
game on the line.
"At the end ofshot clocks, at the
end of games, if we were drawing
up things, it was going to them,"
Beilein said. "Who are you draw-
ing up things for the end of the
game? Those are the things we're
working through right now."

"Your best shot at winning a

win these games," said Michi-
gan coach Greg Ryan. "I think
this team is as good, if not bet-
ter, than the team we had last

The Wolverines are now sec-
ond in the conference stand-
ings with 19 points, two behind
Nebraska.
"Coming off those two wins,
I think we really need to refo-
cus," said senior defender She-
lina Zadorsky. "Those are in the
past now, and all that matters
are the three games we have
left."
This weekend, Michigan will
play its final two road confer-
ence games.
Friday, the Wolverines will
head to Champaign, IL, host of
the conference tournament in
November. Sunday, Michigan
will face Northwestern, closing
out the weekend in the Windy
City.
The Fighting Illini (3-4-1,
8-6-2) are a powerhouse on
offense. They are led by for-
ward Jannelle Flaws, who has
tied the Illinois single-season
scoring record with 18 goals,
which leads the conference.
In addition to Flaws, 12 play-
ers have added to the Illini's 41
combined goals, good for sec-
ond-most in the Big Ten.

Even with the offensive fire-
power, The Illini have been
shorthanded, missing their
two-time NSCAAAll-American
forward Vanessa DiBernardo.
DiBernardo has missed the last
six games due to a knee sprain.
It remains to be seen if she will
return Friday.'
"They've been very unfortu-
nate not to have Vanessa," Ryan
said. "She's certainly a differ-
ence maker."
On defense, Illinois' goal-
keeper Claire Wheatley will be
hard to beat. She has reached
a career-high nine saves three
times on her way to 79 total
saves this season, second most
in the conference.
The Wildcats (1-7, 3-11-2)
have won only one conference
game - largely due to their
struggling offense that has
scored just 15 goals this season,
worst in the Big Ten.
On a five-game win streak,
their longest since 2001, the
Wolverines are more focused
than ever and hope to finish
strong, claiming the Big Ten
title. For weeks, they have been
in a tight uphill battle with the
Cornhuskers for first place.
If Michigan wants to come

"Defense win games, and
that's just the fact of the mat-
ter," Zadorsky said. "If we can
continue going collectively and
have each individual know their
role, I think we'll have success."
Added Ryan: "We have great
defending, we're fast in the
counter attack and we have the
Nkem factor."
The key to success for the
Wolverines may lie in early
scoring opportunities, as Mich-
igan is 10-0 this year when
scoring first.
Zadorsky said capitalizingon
these early chances is extreme-
ly important to the team's suc-
cess, as it allows them to pick
up on the game's momentum.
"It's critical to score early,"
Ryan said. "We want to get on
top of (Illinois) and not be the
team chasing the game and try-
ing to play from behind."
"The focus isn't on Big Ten
Championship or going unde-
feated. The focus is on playing
Illinois Friday night, and if we
keep our heads right, maybe
things will turn out good for
us."

who answer the press box phone,
started working for the Athletic
Department in 1955 and 1968,
respectively. If there's anyone
who's seen history at the Big
House, it's these two.
At its core, their job is simple
- Parker and Collica answer the
phone to provide game statistics
to media outlets. If a radio sta-
tion or TV network has questions
about the game, Parker and Col-
lica are the ones they talk to.
The two have received every
kind of call imaginable, from a
mother demanding to speak to
her injured son on the field to
bomb threats in the late 1960s
and early 70s.

"We've had a lot of fun with
the media," Collica said. "They
rely on us a great deal, particu-
larly after the game. It's been a
fun job."
After this past weekend, Park-
er's consecutive home-game
streak is now. up to 434. It very
nearly ended in 2001, though.
On Sept. 8, 2001 the Wolver-
ines played Washington in Seat-
tle so Parker and his wife decided
to head down to San Francisco
afterward for a mini-break. Fol-
lowing the 9/11 terrorist attacks,
planes were grounded indefi-
nitely, it seemed unlikely Parker
was going to make it back to Ann
Arbor in time for Michigan's next
matchup against Western Michi-
gan. But the game was postponed .
until the following week and the
streak survived.
"It's selfish, but (the delays)
kept (the streak) going," Parker
said smiling.
From .Michigan's last minute
heroics against Notre Dame to
Desmond Howard's Heisman
pose, there have been many icon-
ic moments at the Big House.
But out of those 434 games,
it's not hard for Parker to pick a
favorite. Anthony Carter's touch-
down catch against Indiana in
1979 is a close second, but Mich-
igan-Ohio State in 1969 takes the

cake.
Michigan fans don't need to
be told how the story plays out.
Looking back, Parker has never
seen anything like it in a press
box anywhere after the Wolver-
ines upset the Buckeyes, 24-12.
"The local Detroit media ...
said 'No way Michigan can win
this game,' " Parker said. "It was
like an impossible game. It got
down to the last minute, this
whole place started vibrating. It
just went ballistic."
There's a very strict policy
about not showing partisanship
in the press box. But on that day,
all rules went out the window.
"They came on the PA and
said, 'There's no cheering in the
press box, but today, we'll make
an exception,' "Parker said.
The 1969 edition of The Game
is Collica's favorite too, but for
a different reason - by the time
November 22 rolled around, his
pregnant wife was three weeks
overdue. And when the phone
rang for Collica, he knew it was
his wife saying she had gone into
labor before he even picked up.
The pair could talk for hours
about their stories from over the
decades, from the time the field
flooded and former Michigan
Athletic Director Don Canham
jokingly demanded a thousand

squeegees to mop it up, to the
time the first cell phone was used
in the stadium.
Parker and Collica have time
to reminisce now - games are
less hectic than they used to be.
Before the advent of the Inter-
net, even in the early 2000s, the
phone would ring after every
play, with radio stations needing
to know every single detail.
Now, things like Twitter and
statistic websites mean that peo-
ple can find that kind of informa-
tion on their own without having
to go through an actual person.
But that doesn't mean the duo
thinks they're obsolete.
"Are we still needed here?"
Collica asked. "Yes, because
phone calls still need to come in.
Like any demographic, things
have changed, and technology
has changed."
When the old press box was
torn down after the 2009 season
as the whole stadium underwent
renovations, employees were told
they could take anything, they
wanted as a memento.
Collica took the old phone, the
one that had been his and Park-
er's friend those many years. It's
sitting at his house, and though it
won't be ringing any time soon,
the sounds of Michigan football
continue to echo in Collica's ears.

Minnesota
The Gophers are ranked first in
the country despite losing three
slayers who combined for more
than 35 points last season - Nick
Bjugstad, Erik Haula and Zach Bud-
ish, who have allmoved onto the
NHL.
One question mark for Minneso-
ta will be how to replace 123 points
the trio combined for last year. A
terrific recruiting class is a good
starting point, as Minnesota brings
.f4n seven talented freshmen that will
be expected to play significant roles.
Leading the pack will be Taylor
Cammarata, the Player of the Year
in the United States Hockey League
last season. He should fit nicely into
the Gophers' top two lines, with
classmates Vinni Lettieri and Hud-
son Fasching contributing on lower
lines.

questions, especially with the likes
of senior captain Frankie Simonelli
and junior Jake McCabe making up
one of the top blue line pairings in
the nation. Amongst many returning
upperclassmen, Wisconsin has just
five true freshmen on the roster. For-
ward Grant Besse looks to make the
most immediate impact after scor-
ing 76 points in his senior season at
Benilde-St. Margaret's High School
en route to winning Minnesota's Mr.

The Badgers' experience and

Michigan coach Red

coaching staff had briefly
talked with Andrew, but
still no scholarship on the
table. offers from Nebraska-
',"Omaha, Western Michigan
and Miami Ohio came in,
but many schools hadn't seen
enough of him since they
recruit during the football
season.
"You go through a lot of
doubts, wondering if you're
going to be able to play col-

lege hockey," Andy said about
his son.
But after Brown's depar-
ture, Andrew went from an
afterthought to an important
recruit for the coaching staff.
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son and assistant coaches
Billy Powers and Brian Wise-
man invited Andrew in for a
visit that same month.
This was it, the opportu-
nity to play for the team he'd
grown up watching. He made
one more visit, but by then,
Andrew was being spoiled.
At the end, Andrew and his
father walked with Berenson
out to the car while Andrew
smiled the entire time. He
committed that night..
"I'm sure he wanted us
to want him, too," Berenson

said. "He wanted this to be
a good fit. And I think it's
worked out better than any-
one could have ever imag-
ined."
With 1:07 remaining in the
Central Collegiate Hockey
Association championship,
Notre Dame's Jeff Costello
flung the puck near center ice
into an empty net past a div-
ing Steve Racine, and with it,
Andrew Copp watched his
team make history. After 22
consecutive NCCA Tourna-
ment berths, he would have
his name associated with
breaking "The Streak."
This wasn't what Andrew
had in mind when he set foot
in Yost. The Streak started
before he was born and

would end on his rookie cam-
paign, no matter howhard he
worked.
This memory haunts him.
They haunt everyone on that
team.
Months later, Andr6w is
with his family at the Pru-
dential Center in New Jersey.
He's waited three rounds of
the NHL Draft to hear his
name called in the fourth
round by the Winnipeg Jets.
A smile filled his face
at that moment and four
months later, it's still there
when he describes the story.
"It was indescribable, real-
ly," Andy said.
But for now, Andrew is
beginning his sophomore
year at Michigan, where the
jersey he pulls over his head

is emblazoned with the 'A.'
It's Oct. 9, the Wolverines'
season opener against Boston
College, and Andrew skates
out onto the ice with the
same drive that he did under
his father's tutelage and the
same passion he had from the
beginning.
"The Victors" echoes
throughout the cavernous
roof of Yost as Andrew skates
out to the circle to take the
first faceoff of the year. He
yells out to his teammates,
piles on the net just before
the face off with everyone.
He's back in his element
now asa leader.
"He is me and (senior for-
ward) Derek's (DeBlois)gate-
way into the lower classes,"
said senior defenseman Mac

Bennett. "He is the guy who
is close to the freshmen, he is
close to the guys in his class,
and he's done a tremendous
job.
"Andrew is a very easy kid
to be around. There's a rea-
son he's a captain."
A month ago, Andrew vis-
ited his alma mater for a foot-
ball game. Watching from the
stands this time, Andrew has
his phone out, sending texts
to Arthur on the offense's
miscue or where the defense
is exposed. He talks with
former teammates after the
game or calls up his coach
from time to time.
It's been three years and
he's wearing skates instead of
cleats, but Andrew Copp still
won't give up on his team.

The Apology Season

There is a sign, a big sign
with two block 'M's on
either side hanging in the
locker room at Yost Ice Arena.
During the week, it reads: Win
the next game.
On game days,
senior captain
Mac Bennett
swaps it for a
new one: Win
this game.
After a vic-
tory over Bos-EERIN
ton College in LENNON
the home open-
er, the sign was
replaced with the letters "BC," if
only for a moment of celebration.
The poster found its home in
Yost prior to the 2013-14 season,
after Bennett sat down with
his team to outline goals for
the upcoming year. Apart from
dreams of a national champion-
ship, the consensus was simple:
win the next game.
"The funny thing about it is
that if you win the next game,
eventually there's no more games
to win," Bennett said.
That is the motto of'Team 57,'
however clich6 it may sound.
Bennett apologizes for refer-
ring to last year so often when
talking about this team's charac-
ter, promising not to bring it up
again once the season picks up.

team dinners. The Wolver-

injured goaltender Steve Racine,
freshman Zach Nagevoort pro-
duced two solid games against
New Hampshire last weekend -
keeping the Wolverines out of the
loss column in overtime.
But Bennett knows the threat
of collapse is still very real. In
2012, Michigan was ranked No.
3 in preseason polls, projected
to make another NCAA title
run and to continue its 22-year
tournament-appearance streak.
The Wolverines had dazzling
freshmen last year, too. Jared
Rutledge, Jacob Trouba and Boo
Nieves, each of whom came to
Ann Arbor destined for greatness.
After a dominant exhibition-game
victory over Windsor at Yost, it
looked like Michigan would live
up to all of those expectations.
You know the rest.
Before the Wolverines' exhibi-
tion game against Waterloo (Ont.),
Bennett said that this team -
ranked No. 10 according to USA
Today - would surprise people
this season, knowing the expecta-
tions for this year had been low-
ered after last. For many schools,
a top-10 nod is not too shabby,
unless you're Michigan.
And so, with expectations and
disappointments in mind, every-
thing this year will be compared
the dismal lows and ultra highs
of last season. Every win will be

one more apology written into the
history books, every loss a sting-
ing reminder of what has yet to be
erased.
"We have the mentality of: just
focus on the here and now," said
sophomore forward Boo Nieves.
"Do what you can and play your
role."
The only Wolverine who
doesn't mention last season is
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
Without him, a post-seasonless
year is not the travesty that it was
this past March.
He built the status quo. Beren-
son doesn't need to apologize
and he doesn't want to hear 'I'm
sorry,' either.
He, like this Michigan hockey
team, wants one win at a time.
"We're playing for Michigan,
for that block 'M' and what its
represents," DeBlois said. "It's
kind of cliche but it's such a privi-
lege to put on that sweater."
So the Wolverines aren't apolo-
gizing to Berenson or the Chil-
dren of Yost, to former Wolverine
greats or even to themselves.
They are apologizing to the raf-
ters, to the banners of old and to
the ones they could have added.

In 2013, off-ice activities and
meals aren't organic, but this
doesn't diminish their impor-
tance.
This is an entirely new team.
More than a quarter of the roster
is new to Michigan hockey. But

back: not strong enough to
be a lineman, not quite tall
enough to be a wide receiver,
but a powerful arm, shifti-
ness and decisiveness.
"I personally think he's
the best quarterback I've
ever seen,' said Skyline head
coach Lee Arthur, an 18-year
veteran coach with time
in Saginaw and Ann Arbor
,.,.~Huron. "I've seen some great
quarterbacks, and I don't
care what name you pull up."
Andrew rarely lined up
under center, almost always
in shotgun, where he was as
much of a threat to run as
'he is to pass. His throwing
motion is a bit unorthodox,

though, resembling current
Nebraska quarterback Taylor
Martinez's baseball motion.
Andrew would wind his arm
back like a pitcher would a
fastball, shifting momentum
back and then thrusting him-
self forward.
But if anything, Andrew
was effective. He escaped
pressure, with a quick lateral
juke when his line fell apart
or moved the play to the right
to force a receiver open when
the play had broken apart.
"He's one of the smartest
guys on the football field,"
Arthur said. "He knew where
he was going with the ball -
he could read defenses."
Andrew runs right as
the pocket collapses, three
defenders chasing him, then
four then six. Five yards back,
Andrew stutters and the

tackler has made his move
too soon, grabbing Andrew's
shoulders as a last hope to
bring him down.
At the moment when
he appears to fall, Andrew
ducks the tackle and sprints
forward looking downfield.
Now there are four defenders
closing in from every direc-
tion. Before he's hit, Andrew
slides with his left leg for-
ward then heaves the ball to
an open receiver eight yards
down the field.
A 10-yard loss turns into
a 25-yard gain, and a drive
down the field that looked
threatened had a new life.
The lineman places his
hands up and walks up with
his head staring down at the
field. That defender knew
there were so few quarter-
backs that would have opted

to make that play, because
there are so few athletes like
Andrew Copp.
Second chances are hard
to come by. But Andrew
Copp's came just five months
after he turned down his
dream.
An ankle injury hadcut his
junior season of football short
by a couple of weeks, and
took him out of any sort of
physical activity for Novem-
ber. Andrew's love of hockey
never stopped, but now there
were fewer options to con-
tinue playing.
There was the United
States Hockey League,
but that would mean a
full-fledged commitment.
Andrew still wasn't going to
leave his team, not when they
needed him in his senior year.

But in December, just
before his holiday break,
Andrew received a visit from
Ryan Rezmierski, the head of
hockey personnel of the U.S.
NTDP.
"What have you got going
this weekend?" Rezmierski
said.
"I've got a couple of Michi-
gan Major games," Andrew
replied.
"Well, not anymore," Rez-
miersk responded. "We need
a guy and you're our guy."
There was a spot for him,.
if only just for one weekend,
when injuries and camps
left the U.S. NTDP with only
eight forwards.
Here Andrew sat again,
with the same opportunity to
live out his dream. This time
there was little hesitation.
Andrew travelled to Fargo

to play for his first game of
the weekend against the
Fargo Force of the USHL. His
team lost, 7-1. Andrew had
the only goal.
He was moved to the top
line, where he played well
enough against skaters more
than six years his age.
His performance on short
notice was enough to keep
him on the team for good,
even with football, for the
next year and a half.
Back at Yost, Andrew's
eyes begin to close a bit and
a smile lights up his suddenly
red face. After sitting on the
edge of his seat for 15 min-
utes, Andrew finally relaxes,
talking about a dream ful-
filled.
"I was ecstatic."

Andrew Copp:
Off the Gridiron,
onto thef rIce
by Greg Garno, Daily Staff Sports Writer



Andrew Copp sat at the Ann
Arbor Ice Cube three years
ago, facing one of the defining
moments of his young athletic
career.
He had waited so long for this
occasion - essentially his entire
life.
At the end of August, before
his junior year at Skyline High
School in Ann Arbor even began,
Andrew sat with his father,
Andy, listening to coaches from
the U.S. U-18 National Team
Development Program. They
presented Andrew with an
opportunity, one that had fallen
into place in just a short time: the
chance to play hockey while rep-
resenting his country.
The privilege is afforded to
less than 25 young men each
year. The group travels the
country to play against the best
college talent and garners the
attention of college coaches
and most importantly, National
Hockey League scouts.
Andrew had tried out for the
team in March, but didn't make
it. Now, he sat staring down his
second chance at fulfilling "a
dream," as his father would later
say.
But there was one caveat.
"You'll have to quit football,"
they would tell the starting
quarterback.
Quit? Surely, there must be a
way to do both. They wouldn't
leave him with that ultimatum,
would they?
"I can't. I can't quit on my
team. I can't let those people
down. I can't walk odt on these
people now," Andrew would

recall.
So he didn't. Now there's no
hesitation in his voice when he
speaks. He glances back up and
continues his story. Andrew's
gotten used to repeating it, now.
"I guess looking back on it, it
was kind of dumb," Andrew said
with a laugh.
"I wasn't 100-percent excited
about the decision," his father
added.
Yet behind the disappoint-
ment and the frustration,
Andrew's life fell into place five
months later, putting him on his
path to Michigan.
Three years after that fate-
ful day, Andrew is an alternate
captain for the Michigan hockey
team as a sophomore forward, -
waiting for his time to join the
Winnipeg Jets organization.
Once again in his life, Andrew
finds himself at the center of an
organization. And at the center
of Andrew is his character.
"I think that's what really
defines his character level," his
father said. "That he was willing
to turn down his dream, because
of his responsibility to his foot-
ball team."
Andrew's character level.
has come to define his work
ethic. His work ethic has come
to define how he performs in
a game. And his performance
could be what defines the Wol-
verines this year.
Andrew Copp grew up in a
hockey family. Like so many of
his teammates, he has played
since he was young and hasn't
stopped.

"Since he could walk," Andy
said.
His father has been a hockey
coach for nearly all of Andrew's
life for the Compuware teams a
short drive away in Plymouth,
Mich.
Andrew's mother was a figure
skating coach for the Wolver-
ines, making her living on the
ice. His brother, meanwhile, is
also a hockey player.
Andrew's father wasn't a
standout NHL player or a col-
lege star, but he loved the game
- something his son has picked
up as well.
When he wasn't on the ice,
Andrew spent his time watch-
ing more hockey, idolizing play-
ers like Michigan's first Hobey
Baker winner and Vancouver
Canuck, Brendan Morrison.
And when he wasn't watching it
on the TV or playing on the ice,
Andrew travelled the 15 minutes
to campus to watch Michigan
play at Yost.
"Hockey was always his first,
and his second, commitment,"
Andy said.
Andrew's family owned sea-
son tickets for much of his child-
hood, where he witnessed the
great players like Morrison and
goaltender Marty Turco on the
ice.
Andrew, though, had his
chance to follow his childhood
dream by accepting the position
on the U.S. NTDP - which regu-
larly fed players into Michigan.
He turned down that future.
Andrew Copp was a natural,
even though organized tackle

football was never a reality until"'
he was 14 years old and a fresh-
man in high school.
At Emerson School, a K-8
school 20 minutes west of Ann
Arbor, Andrew didn't have the
opportunities to compete in
anything outside of basketball
or track, so he competed in flag
football on weekends in the fall
and baseball in the summer.
Hockey was always his No. 1
priority, though. After eighth
grade, Andrew sat down with
his parents at home and dis-
cussed his future.
Andrew wasn't keen on going
to a private school in Ann Arbor.
And with a new public school
opening nearby to relieve the
overcrowded Ann Arbor Pioneer
and Huron High Schools, there
was one likely choice. Plus, Sky-
line offered football, something
his parents supported in the
summer and hoped would act as
an important social aspect.
"I encouraged him to play
football, because I thought it
was a really good experience
for him," Andy said. "I thought
the physicality would definitely
help him in hockey. That was
one of the things that Michigan
and other schools had said, they
wanted to see him be a little bit
more physical."
Andrew wasn't quite ready
for the next stage in hockey, but
football helped prepare him?'%-
With football, he could improve
his physicality for hockey.
Everything was done for hockey.
From the start, Andrew was
a natural fit to be a quarter-
