deans hail from
outside institutions
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
At their monthly meeting
Thursday afternoon, the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents confirmed
the appointment of Andrew
Martin, current vice dean of the
School of Law at Washington
University in St. Louis, as the
next dean of the College of Lit-
erature, Science and the Arts.
Martin was one of two dean
appointments approved Thurs-
day. James Dalton, a former
professor at The Ohio State Uni-
versity who most recently led
research and development at a
Memphis pharmaceutical com-
pany, was selected to head the
University's College of Pharma-
cy.
Whereas dean selections fre-
quently come from within the
institution, both of Thursday's
selections were external hires.
History Prof. Terrence
McDonald, director of the Bent-

ley Historical Library and former
LSA dean, said there are benefits
and drawbacks of an external
appointment like Martin.
"The widely thought benefit
of an external person is that they
come from a different context
and may have ideas that come out
of that context," McDonald said.
"Therefore some people would
argue that you have a chance
of a fresh look when you bring
somebody from the outside. The
contrary argument is that there
is a terribly steep learning curve
from someone who comes from
the outside. Inside people ironi-
cally know how to get things
done as well. SoI don't think that
necessarily either kind person
is necessarily going to be better
than the other."
McDonald, who served as
dean for a decade and has been
at the University since 1980,
stepped down in 2012 to direct
the Bentley Historical Library.
He was replaced by LSA interim
dean Susan Gelman, a professor
of psychology at the University.
Martin's term officially begins
July 1 of this year, and comes
with a tenured professorship

Regents approve
$6.9 million plan to
invigorate student
engagement
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
At the University's month-
ly Board of Regents meeting
Thursday, the board approved
the North Campus Grove proj-
ect, which will transform the

area's outdoor space.
The project will improve the
four acres of around the Lurie
Tower, located in between the
Duderstadt Center, Electrical
Engineering Computer Science,
H.H. Dow Building, Beyster
Building and Stamps Audito-
rium. With a budget of $6.9 mil-
lion, the initiative will renovate
the central plaza, plant addi-
tional trees, improve lighting,
add new walkways with seat:
ing throughout and feature an
informal amphitheater.
The renovations are con-

sistent with the North Cam-
pus Master plan that has been
revised many times, said Tim
Slottow, executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer.
"The North Campus Grove
project will greatly improve the
quality of this outdoor space,
creating more vitality and activ-
ity within the North Campus
core, and providing more oppor-
tunities for multidisciplinary
interaction," Slottow wrote in a
communication Monday.
Aplaza,madeprimarilyofbrick,
will be created on one side of the

Tower to provide a meeting place
and at times a stage for events,
DeanofEngineeringDave Munson
said. The space will accommodate
approximately 800 people.
The North Campus Diag,
which is currently flat, will
undergo landscaping changes
to create small hills for outdoor
seating to be built into.
"It is not going to be a tradi-
tional amphitheater," Munson
said. "We don't want that because

used look empty, and we don't

Expanded resources

By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
As a new push in the state to
increase immigration to promote
economic prosperity increases,
international student retention
has become a key focus, leading
to involvement from many col-
leges in the state, including the
University.
As of the Fall 2013 semester,
the international-student popu-
lation numbered 5,963 under-
graduate and graduate students,
according to data from the Inter-
national Center's 2013 annual
report. The number has been
increasing steadily since the
early 2000s, rising more than
1,500 since 2004.
After they graduate, these stu-
dents have two main options if
they want to stay in the state or
in the country: pursue another
degree or find a job through
post-completion optional practi-
cal training, or OPT. OPT allows
graduates to stay in the United
States for a preliminary period of
12 months as long as they find a
job in their field of study.
Right now, only about a fifth of
University international students
stay on OPT following gradua-
tion. However, a new program

may enhance more young talent
to extend their stay in the state.
Global Detroit, an initiative
to attract immigrants to Detroit,
was founded in 2010 to imple-
ment the objectives recommend-
ed by a study of the same name,
which found that immigrant tal-
ent is a huge driver of both the
U.S. economy and the Michigan
economy.
Global Detroit Director Steve
Tobocman said international
students have the potential to fill
in gaps in the state's STEM and
entrepreneurship fields.
"The average immigrant high-
tech entrepreneur starts their
business 13 years after enter-
ing the country, and the number
one reason they come to the U.S.
is not to start a business, but to
get an education," Tobocman
said. "You see international stu-
dent retention as the pathway to
become the Silicon Valley of the
Midwest."
Jeff Mason, executive direc-
tor of the University Research
Corridor, which is a partnership
between the University, Wayne
State University and Michigan
State University, said the URC's
three member schools are espe-
cially important for talent reten-
tion because of their research
focuses.
"Our three universities are a
tremendous pipeline to produce
that kind of talent, particularly
in the STEM fields," Mason said.
When it was founded in 2006,
the URC's initial focus was on

By TOM MCBRIEN
Daily StaffReporter
Think about a lecture you
attended just two days ago.
How many facts can you recall?
Odds are, not many. Decades of
research have shown that the
traditional lecture is a poor way
to teach, and a group of Univer-
sity faculty leaders is planning
to change how science and math
courses are taught over the next
three to five years.
The program, called
REBUILD - Researching Evi-
dence Based Undergraduate

Developments - received a $2
million National Science Foun-
dation grant to study evidence-
based educational practices and
institute the findings in intro-
ductory science courses that
affect more than 8,000 students
per term. Classes such as organ-
ic chemistry, introductory phys-
ics and introductory biology
could all see large changes.
For the past 30 years, the

Chaos follows the South Globally renowned novelist

Korean ferry accident

passes away at the age of 87

Boat sinking leaves
25 people dead with
270 passengers still
missing
MOKPO, South Korea (AP) -
There was chaos and confusion
on the bridge of a sinking ferry,
with the captain first trying
to stabilize the listing vessel
before ordering its evacuation,
a crewman said Thursday.
By the time the order came,
however, he said it had become
impossible to help many of the
passengers - although the cap-
tain and a dozen crew members
survived.
The confirmed death toll
from Wednesday's sinking of
the Sawol off southern South
Korea was 25, the coast guard
said. But the number was
expected to rise with about 270
people missing, many of them
high school students on a class
H-U

trip. Officials said there were
179 survivors.
Divers worked in shifts to
try to get into the sunken ves-
sel, but strong currents would
not allow them to enter, said
coast guard spokesman Kim
Jae-in. The divers planned to
pump oxygen into the ship to
help any survivors, but first
they had to get inside, he
added.
The water temperature in
the area was about 12 degrees
Celsius (54 degrees Fahren-
heit), cold enough to cause
signs of hypothermia after
about 90 minutes of exposure.
Kim said three vessels with
cranes are being brought in to
help with the rescue and to
salvage the ferry, which sank
not far from the southern city
of Mokpo and now sits with
just part of its keel visible.
The captain of the Sawol,
identified by broadcaster YTN
and the Yonhap news agency
as 68-year-old Lee Joon-seok,
5-m

was questioned by the coast
guard and made a brief, vid-
eotaped appearance, although
his face was hidden by a gray
hoodie.
"I am really sorry and deep-
ly ashamed," Lee said. "I don't
know what to say."
Kim Soo-hyun, a senior
coast guard official, said
officials were investigating
whether the captain got on
one of the first rescue boats.
Kim Han-sik, president of
Chonghaejin Marine Co., the
ship's owner, also apologized
separately, bowing deeply and
saying through his tears, "I
committed a sin punishable
by death. ... I am at a loss for
words. I am sorry. I am sorry."
The 146-meter (480-foot)
Sewol had left Incheon on
the northwestern coast of
South Korea on Tuesday for
the overnight journey to the
southern resort island of Jeju.
There were 475 people aboard,
including 325 students from
Danwon High School in
Ansan, which is near Seoul.
It was three hours from its
destination Weadnesday morn-
ing when it began to list for an
unknown reason.
Oh Yong-seok, a helmsman
on the ferry with 10 years of
shipping experience, said that
when the crew gathered on
the bridge and sent a distress
call, the ship was already list-
ing more than 5 degrees, the
critical angle at which a vessel
can be brought back to even
keel.
The first instructions from
the captain were for passen-
gers to put on life jackets and
stay where they were, Oh said.
Video obtained by The
Associated Press that was
shot by a survivor, truck driv-
er Kim Dong-soo, shows the
vessel listing severely with
people in life jackets cling-
ing to the side of the ship to
keep from sliding. The initial
announcement for passengers
to stay in their quarters can be
heard.

Garcia Marquez was born in
Aracataca, a small Colombian
town near the Caribbean coast on
March 6, 1927. He was the eldest
of the 11 children of Luisa San-
tiaga Marquez and Gabriel Elijio
Garcia, a telegraphist and a wan-
dering homeopathic pharmacist
who fathered at least four chil-
dren outside of his marriage.
Just after their first son was
born, his parents left him with
his maternal grandparents and
moved to Barranquilla, where
Garcia Marquez's father opened
the first of a series of homeopathic
pharmacies that would invariably
fail, leaving them barely able to
make ends meet.
Garcia Marquez was raised for
10 years by his grandmother and
his grandfather, a retired colo-
nel who fought in the devastat-
ing 1,000-Day War that hastened
Colombia's loss of the Panama-
nian isthmus.
His grandparents' tales would
provide grist for Garcia Mar-
quez's fiction and Aracataca
became the model for Macondo,
the village surrounded by banana
plantations at the foot of the Sier-
ra Nevada mountains where "One

DETROIT
Doctor found
guilty of 34 crimes
A Detroit-area doctor who
would see more than 100 patients
a day at his Hamtramck clinic has
been convicted of 34 crimes, from
fraud to illegal drug distribution.
It was a slam-dunk for federal
prosecutors Thursday as Dr. Basil
Qandil was found guilty of all
charges. Qandil was accused of
writing prescriptions for drugs
that would be sold on the streets.
In turn, he would bill Medicare
and Medicaid.
The government says he would
write prescriptions for an entire
family when only one member of
the family was in the clinic. Lines
would form at 8 a.m. and block
entry to a bank next door.

An ex-con who spent most of
his adult life in behind bars on

wanted for robbing a suburban
Chicago bank. The 74-year-old

As he had on the day he robbed

Judge questions
Oklahoma's gay
marriage ban
A judge in Colorado who
will play a pivotal role deciding
whether gays should be allowed
to wed in the United States asked
pointed questions Thursday
about whether Oklahoma can
legally ban the unions.
U.S. Circuit Judge Jerome
Holmes is seen as the swing vote
on the three-judge panel that
heard the Oklahoma appeal and a
similar case from Utah last week.
The two cases are the first to
reach an appellate court since
the U.S. Supreme Court last year
struck down the federal Defense
of Marriage Act. Since then, gay
rights lawyers have successfully

convinced eight federal judges
that the ruling means courts must
strike down laws against gay mar-
riage because they deprive same-

talks North Korea
The head of the commis-
sion of inquiry that accused
North Korea of crimes against
humanity told the U.N. Secu-
rity Council on Thursday that
it must take action against
"a totalitarian state without
parallel in the contemporary
world," and he told reporters
that most council members
"expressly said" the matter
should be referred to the Inter-
national Criminal Court.
It was the first time the
council had met to discuss the
unprecedented U.N. report that
contains graphic details and an
urgent call to action. The infor-
mal meeting comes as members
of the commission push for its
findings to be formally referred
to the council and the ICC.

first resolution passed by the
CSG assembly this school year
- was a call for student input
in future ticketing policies,
which was ultimately success-
ful in March when the Athletic
Department scrapped general
admission seating.
In an e-mail interview, Hunter
Lochmann, Athletic Department
chief marketing officer, said
working with Proppe and Dishell
to reform the seating policies
established the importance of
having a student voice contribute
to administrative decisions.
"Michael and Bobby have
been great partners throughout
the entire student ticketing pro-
cesses, both for football and for
basketball," he wrote. "They've
worked hard to represent and
communicate the students' best
interests and have been a good
sounding board for us in Ath-
letics. I appreciate the positive
relationship they have formed
between CSG and Athletics
going forward."
Proppe said increasing the
power ofstudents on campus was
consistently a goal of his, and the
CSG assembly's, throughout the
year.
When the University's Board
of Regents decided not to pro-
vide any student representatives
a seat on the presidential search
committee, Proppe and the CSG
assembly created a poll to ask the
student body what they hoped
to see from their new University
president. CSG submitted these
results to the regents' search
committee.
Additionally, he and Law stu-
dent Jeremy Keeney, CSG stu-
dent general counsel, introduced
a resolution to the assembly ask-
ing for increased student over-
sight of the Statement of Rights
and Responsibilities. The cur-
rent hierarchy allows the Office

of Student Conflict Resolution
and faculty to submit proposed
amendments to the statement
directly to the Student Relations
Advisory Committee without
consulting CSG first. The reso-
lution, which passed in Janu-
ary, would have made CSG input
mandatory. However, SRAC
struck it down.
Proppe's goal to promote stu-
dents was also evident in the
$10,000 CSG assembly contri-
bution to MUSIC Matters' end-
of-year event, SpringFest. This
year, LSA senior Phil Schermer,
MUSIC Matters president, said
SpringFest said the duo "active
supporters" of MUSIC Matters'
goals to elevate the student body
as a whole.
"CSG's role is to hear what stu-
dents want to do and help make it
happen," Schermer said. "We've
had a fantastic relationship with
that entire team."
While student voice was a
priority of Proppe's, there were
times this year when students
felt silenced rather than support-
ed. Though the CSG assembly
did pass resolutions in support
of the Black Student Union and
its #BBUM movement, it had a
more difficult relationship with
Students Allied for Freedom and
Equality, a pro-Palestinian stu-
dent organization that called for
the investigation of companies
allegedly complicit in human
rights violations in Palestine.
The CSG assembly initially
voted to indefinitely postpone
a full vote on a SAFE resolu-
tion asking for CSG's support in
divesting from these companies
in March. The assembly ulti-
mately voted down the resolu-
tion atits next meeting.
At the time of the indefinite
postponement, LSA senior Suha
Najjar, a member of SAFE, said
ignoring the resolution posed a
limitation on students' speech.
"What happened on this cam-
pus should never happen," she
said in a March interview with

The Michigan Daily. "What
we're hopingis to send a message
that we're the student body and
you need to listen to us."
Proppe said SAFE's subse-
quent sit-in set an important
precedent for CSG in the future.
"We spend alot of time talking
about the importance of the stu-
dent voice, and for us to do that
with legitimacy we have to make
sure that we are fully listening to
the voices of students."
"I think, moving forward,
you're not going to see CSG
indefinitely postponing resolu-
tions that students bring for-
ward," he added. "If students or
student groups put all the time
into bringing forth a resolution,
that resolution deserves a vote,
'yes' or 'no.'
Proppe said others accused
CSG of placing too much prior-
ity on the Athletic Department,
whereas diversity fell by the
wayside. He said significant bud-
get cuts may have made it seem
that CSG was less focused on
student organizations - but this
is not the case.
The assembly's strongest
strides for diversity and equality
on campus, he said, were CSG's
work in tandem with the BSU,
resolutions in support of tuition
equality and efforts bolster-
ing more University outreach
in underprivileged communi-
ties - which are also reflected in
Dishell's desired reforms as CSG
president.
Ultimately, Proppe said he
understands that not everyone
can be happy with what was
accomplished during his tenure
as president. He said there is
always more to be done.
"I think that we really dem-
onstrated this year that when
students and administrators are
working together, there are just
much better outcomes for the
University as a whole," he said. "I
hope this has really been a learn-
ing year for the University com-
munity."

STUDENTS

economic growth and collabora-
tion, but following a 2011 grant
from a private foundation, it
began pursuing ways to retain
international talent.
Today, the University's
involvement in the URC rep-
resents its main connection to
the statewide immigrant talent-
retention movement.
On a statewide level, the URC
works to promote international-
student-friendly hiring prac-
tices and make the state more
attractive to potential inter-
national students. On campus,
students often interact with the
URC through the Global Talent
Retention Initiative of Michi-
gan, a program founded in 2011
with which the URC has col-
laborated for the past several
years. GTRI works to encourage
and aid students in staying in the
state after graduation.
GTRI Director Athena Tren-
tin said the initiative's impor-
tance lies in complementing
the services already provided
at universities to better connect
international students to jobs in
Michigan.
"International offices do not
do career services," Trentin said.
"Career offices generally don't
have staff who have the cultural
knowledge to help international
students understand how to
sell themselves in a much more
individualistic setting. So what
we can do is we can come in and
bring that cultural component
in, and we can bridge the inter-
national and the career office."
Trentin added that as GTRI
has developed over time, the
University has been a key part-
ner in its success.
Mason said for all three
schools in the URC, the main

ment.
Martin was among a pool of
international candidates that
the University was vetting for
the position. University Provost
Martha Pollack said his aca-
demic resume and collaborative
skills made his external back-
ground easier to ignore.
"There was a predisposition
amongst a lot of the LSA faculty
to say, 'We don't want someone
from the outside'," Pollack said.
"But when they met Martin,
there was very positive feedback
about him. I think he'll fit in
wonderfully."
On the cusp of a presidential
transition, a number of admin-
istrators have been leaving for
other schools or stepping down
from their roles to engage in
other pursuits, and the Univer-
sity is trending toward replacing
them with faculty from other
universities instead of promot-
ing current faculty.
At the University, deans
propose the budgets for their
academic units and play a signif-
icant role in setting a vision and
culture in the schools and at the

University at large. Deanships
have also been stepping stones
to other University leadership
positions. Before becoming pro-
vost, Pollack was dean of the
School of Information.
Still, McDonald was quick to
warn about viewing such hiring
as along-term trend.

benefit comes from being able
to help enrich the broader state
community.
"I think the whole idea of
having a more educated, skilled
individuals coming out of our
universities and staying in the
state helps to grow the economy,
and that benefits the universi-
ties in terms of having a more
vibrant economy - a growing
economy - here in the state,"
Mason said.
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
government relations, said
the University is also invested
because of the high potential of
students.
"The University is interest-
ed in supporting international
students and their aspirations
because we know we recruit
some of the best and the bright-
est to come to the University,"
Wilbanks said. "If they are inter-
ested in and have the desire to
remain in the state and contrib-
ute to the state's economy in a
variety of ways, I think the Uni-
versity is all for it."
The effects of all these initia-
tives are still unclear because
the programs are still young.
Since 2011, the number of inter-
national students on OPT has
risen by almost 400, but that
increase could also be tied to a
general increase in the number
of international students at the
University, and it is unclear what
state these students are in past
graduation.
Mason said he thinks the
effects of these efforts are start-
ing to become visible both at the
University and in the state.
"I think there's more to
come," Mason said. "It's kind of
the snowball effect. More com-
panies are becoming familiar
and aware of hiring internation-
al students, and I think that will
bode well for the future."
"It's very hard to say that
there is a trend in these things
because you're working with a
certain pool, and so every dean
search is run by a search com-
mittee," McDonald said. "There
may be times when there's a lot
of internal people, and there
may be time when there's a lot
of external people, but I find
that to be more connected to
the components of the pool than
to some kind of trend you know
for example, the provost and the
president decided we should get
more outside deans."
Out of the current deans,
including Dalton and Martin,
10 were external candidates and
nine were internal hires. Seven
of the 12 appointments since
2008 were selected from outside
institutions.
For comparison, former Uni-
versity President James Duder-
stadt, who served from 1988 to
1996, said 13 were inside hires
and three were from the outside.
Additionally, Duderstadt said
seven more deans will approach
the end of their 10-year tenure
by the end of 2017.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily Thursday, Mar-
tin said he was confident that he
would find his footing.
"This is a very, very compli-

cated University," Martin said.
"LSA is a very complicated and
large school. So it will take me
some time to get up to speed
and learn the organization. One
of the things I'm very grate-
ful for is the terrific group of
people in LSA now who will be
helping me through this transi-
tion process.


LEARNING
From Page 1
educational techniques. While
the results of this research are
available to educators, there is
a gap~between knowledge of"
the best educational techniques
and the practices actually used
in introductory STEM classes.
"A typical instructor at the
University gets their job on
the faculty for being an excel-
lent researcher and by being
an excellent researcher," said
Physics Prof. Timothy McKay,
principal investigator for
REBUILD. "So they build a
career that's largely focused
on research until the point that
they become a faculty member.
And then, all of a sudden, they
become a person who's also
going to teach. And very little
formal training usually goes
into teaching."
To address this gap, the pro-
gram will bring together 12 fac-
ulty members from across the
departments of biology, chem-
istry, math and physics who
will meet for at least one and
a half hours once every other
week for the next three years.
These faculty members will
study the current literature on
STEM education, becoming
experts on the subject. They
will then share their findings
with the different departments
during the departments' col-
loquia - weekly meetings in
which all members are present
to learn about and discuss cer-
tain topics.
STEM education is becoming
increasingly important in the

United States and approximate-
ly 40 to 60 percent of prospec-
tive STEM majors drop their
degree program and select a
different major before gradua-
tion. While some of this change
is normal, one major goal of
REBUILD will be to stop the
flow of science and math stu-
dents leaving their majors just
because of the difficulty or
unpleasantness of the intro-
ductory courses.
McKay said that this effort is
an important one for the future
of the University and the future
of education.
"I have this feeling that this
is my one shot in my career to
change something of this scale.
We're down for three years for
sure; it might take five. But if
we don't make it move now, I'm
not going to see it move. Ever,"
McKay said.
The main goal of the program
is to build a culture of change
and innovation in education
across the science and math
departments at the University.
Educators would be expected to
have the time, tools and effort
to use educational techniques
proven by research to be effec-
tive.
The core faculty of the
REBUILD program are still
doing preliminary research and
getting a lay of the land in their
departments before instituting
any big changes.
"How is it being taught? How
is it being learned and how is
it being tested? We have just
started focus groups of students
to address question #2. We plan
to address questions #1 and #2
over the summer," Associate

Chemistry Prof. Anne McNeil
wrote in an e-mail interview.
Changes will likely begin
gradually and grow over time.
Eventually, REBUILD could
alter current introductory sci-
ence courses into almost unrec-
ognizable -versions of their
current forms.
One major alteration could
be changing many courses into
"flipped" classrooms. In this
model, students would teach
themselves a majority of the
material outside of the class-
room using textbooks, video
lectures and other tools. Class
time would then involve teams
of students doing problem
sets, practice exams and other
active-learning components
with the class instructor, GSIs
and undergraduate teaching
assistants walking around to
help.
McKay lauded this type of
learning, saying that it works
especially well because it allows
undergraduates and GSIs to get
more teaching experience. He
added that if the system works,
students should not be spending
any more time on their educa-
tion than they are currently,
due to the reduced need for self-
teaching from lecture slides and
office hours after nearly use-
less lectures. He also said there
would need to be some sort of
increased faculty investment,
whether through hiring new
faculty or greater time invest-
ment by current faculty.
The REBUILD program
began in January 2014 and the
first major changes to courses
could occur as early as this
fall.

Taubman Prof. Douglas Kel-
baugh, former dean of the Taub-
man College of Architecture
and Urban Planning, wrote in
an e-mail interview that the
new trees, walkways, benches
and lighting will create a more
human-scaled and lively center
for students, with the amphi-

theater facilitating informal and
organized outdoor activities.
Kelbaugh said the space
between buildings is often just as
important as the actualstructures.
"The North Campus has always
had an inferiority complex vis-
a-vis the Central Campus," he
wrote. "Conceived and designed
as a suburban campus, it has less
of a vibrant, walkable ambience
and pedestrian vitality, which is
often what graduates most fondly
remember of their student days.
Unlike Central Campus, there
are few outdoor rooms - the leafy
quadrangles, courtyards, and
promenades defined by buildings
that are delightful, comfortable
outdoor environments."
Munson said the funding is
going toward a project that will
benefit all of campus.
"We have alot of buildings that

face the Diag and we felt strongly
enough we decided we would do
the fundraising," Munson said.
The project will be funded
through gifts and College of Engi-
neering resources. The College of
Engineeringexpects thatthe proj-
ect will be paid back for by addi-
tional gifts from donors over time.
The project will result in a
temporary loss of some parking
spaces, but there will be no per-
manent impact on parking. The
project will also create 27 on-site
construction jobs.
School of Art and Design
freshman Olivia Moore said the
North Campus Diag is currently a
place she uses very rarely.
"If there was more to do in that
area I think it would build a bet-
ter sense of community between
all the schools and students on
North Campus," Moore said.

Fighting Molly (and other drugs)
Education and treatment are the best way to combat drug use on campus
According to recent reports, the use of hard drugs on campus
may be on the rise. While the popularity of marijuana is a well-
known cultural trait of Ann Arbor, harder drugs and misused
prescription medication pose a real threat to the safety and well-being of
students. In a recent news report by the The Michigan Daily, not only is
illegal usage of prescription drugs on the rise, but students who took the
Student Life Survey reported an increase in use of other hard drugs such
as Molly. The University can address this troubling trend by supporting
students who may be suffering from drug dependence or abuse by better
advertising the extensive resources for students.

ffyou've ever felt white guilt--.

S top. Stop right now and

the impact of
your guilt.
All of these MAJA
individual TOSIC
reflections are
necessary as
white guilt burns
rampantly among our vast white
student population. The emotion
is infiltrating individual minds,
but this is not an isolated incident.
White guilt is a socially constructed
reaction to socially constructed
racial divisions. It is a purposely
instilled emotion that is taught to
be regarded as an appropriate and
beneficial reaction. But who is it
appropriate and beneficial for?
By gathering several accounts
from my white peers at the
University on the inner workings
of their white guilt, the list of what
situations bring out guilt is endless.
Here on campus, some mentioned
that white guilt crawls up when
they go out to a party and see one
person of color among a sea of
whiteness. For others, guilt wiggles
in when a person of color is serving
them in a restaurant. Some stated
that it sneaks out when they notice
themselves as one of the few white
people in a space. These situations
and many more cause white guilt,
because in that moment individuals
are attaching misconceptions
and wrongful perspectives onto
students of color. In these many
moments, people of color are seen
as perpetual victims.
As students of color live and
learn alongside their white peers,
they're seen as unfortunate and
victims. Their very presence
ignites white guilt in some folks.
People of color are regarded as
victims even in situations that don't
directly place them in the hands of
victimization. As students of color
enjoy their time going out, working
and attending classes, some white
people regard their experiences
as lacking and tragic. Yet, some
white students who feel guilt
believe they're being good white

The University should work to ensure that
students who are suffering or fear they may
be suffering from drug abuse or dependence
have a place to go. The University Health
System has a program for substance abuse
called the University of Michigan Addiction
Treatment Services that students can utilize.
However, the existence of the program needs
to be made more visible and more accessible.
CAPS also provides some counseling on drug
abuse and diagnostic screening, called the
Assessment of Substance Abuse Patterns. In
order to promote the use of these services, the
University needs to make sure students know
they exist, and provide information on how to
best utilize them. Furthermore, students who
have used illegal substances maybe reluctant
to seek help for fear of self-criminalization. It
needs to be made clear through standardized
and frequent statements to patients,
prospective patients and in literature about
the programs that patient confidentiality
will be maintained with the utmost care and
to the highest degree allowed by the law.
Information about available resources should
also be provided in orientation materials and
activities, and be prominently featured in
the AlcoholEduonline educationprogram
- or a similar substitute - to be completed
by incoming freshmen. Proper publicity
and education may allow more students to
recognize the signs of dependence and utilize
University resources to seek treatment.
Though it may be hard to track the degree
at which these prescription drugs - such as
Adderall and Ritalin - are being used illegally,
the main problem lies in the fact that students
aren't aware of the various harmful effects that
such drugs can have. In order to help students
avoid potential dependency on prescription
drugs, the University needs to educate students
about the health problems that arise from
their usage as well as the resources available
to students for help with any drug-related

problems, such as UMATS and ASAP at
CAPS. However, this information could be
more meaningful if it came from a network of
students. This would create an environment of
community awareness, as opposed to the one of
ambiguity and danger currently surrounding
the issue. Most students may not be aware
of the effects these drugs have on the body,
and informing them of these effects through
a network of fellow students could spread
awareness in a relatable way.
The current state and federal drug policies,
created to discourage druguse, exacerbate the
problemofaddictionand abuse insome,though
certainly not all, cases. It is important that the
University makes student wellness a priority
when crafting its own drug policies. In some
cases, programs and warning systems that
work with students to reach the source of the
drug problem might be better than
taking a hard line against all drugs in all
circumstances. Administrators should
work with law enforcement authorities and
addiction and abuse specialists to ensure a
way to legally handle violations of the drug
policy on a case-by-case basis. Because illegal
drug abuse cannot be consistently caught by
law enforcement, when a student is caught it
is important to provide them with the help
they may need. Doing so will help create
a safer campus for all students. Forty-one
percent of violent crimes against college
students were committed by perpetrators
perceived to be under the influence of
drugs. Further, there is a strong correlation
between drug use and incarceration for not
only possession of illegal substances, but
for other crimes as well. Of all inmates, 82.2
percent self-reported using illegal drugs. In
order to help students lead healthy and safe
lives, the University has a responsibility to
not simply punish drug use, but also work
with students by providing support and
pathways to recovery.

Learning to see color

When I check off "white" on applications, I
think of the woman who taught me English. She
immigrated to the United States 22 years ago,
leavingbehind a country torn apart by civil strife.
When I ask if she ever wants to return to Leba-
non, she says she can't. I ask this ofmy mother on
a regular basis, and her answer never changes.
That doesn't make it any less painful to hear.
Taghreed. The song of birds. When birds
chirp, I hear my mother's laughter. I replay
the memories she's recounted to me hundreds
of times in her voice that is my only solace -
memories of a childhood stolen by war. My
mother changed her name when she received
her U.S. citizenship. She grew weary of hearing
it mangled by American tongues.
Don't forgetcwho taught you how to use those
words. My mother is an educated woman. She
holds degrees in journalism and business. She
read, wrote, and spoke English years before
moving to America. And yet, when the slightest
hint of her accent surfaces, she's immediately

am only beginning to understand what it means
to be a woman of color. As a white-passing
person of color, I have privileges my darker-

about myself. In the Arab World, my fair skin
and light eyes are coveted. Here in the United
States, I find myself desperately longing to look

the global obsession with Western standards of
beauty and perturbed by the surge in whitening

everyday task. When my friends question why

lives my parents once led, even though the very
reason we are here is that they would never

This is about the systemic racism that subjects

Color is not binary. Identities are fluid. Peo-

understand that they are all difficult to navigate.
It's not a matter of white versus non-white. It's
a matter of giving people the space they require
to negotiate their feelings and experiences.
I no longer seek others' validation and
affirmation of my thoughts and feelings. When
I say I am a woman of color, it has nothing to
do with my skin and everything to do with
the plight of my people. Refugee camps are
dispersed across the terrains of my heart,
tearing at its seams - this gives me color.
The call to prayer is recited as an explosion
is heard blocks away - this gives me color.
People who dream of returning to their home
one day - they give me color. I am a woman of
color, and I have every right to identify as such.

I thought it would be cool to
reflect on the past four and a half
years of my life.
Then I laughed.
Ilaughedbecause thatwould take
much more out of me than I could
even imagine. I found myself at this
university. I found my passion at
this university. I found my future
at this university. I loved at this
university. I lived at this university.
I learned at this university. And
most importantly, I laughed. Some
laughs so entertaining they would
cause rib pains. Other laughs
so conflicting they stemmed
from pain.
They say laughter is the best
medicine. I'm the girl laughing
three days in a row at the same old
joke. Laughter is my medicine. It
cures all. It cures my bad days. It
cures my discomfort. A day without
laughter is a day without coffee
and I need my coffee. I need my
laughter.
I have been challenged. My
laughter has been challenged.
For how exactly does one laugh in
moments of discomfort? Though
my moments of great comfort are
plenty, my moments of discomfort
will forever be more prominent and
vivid in my mind. My identity has
been questioned, my values have
been challenged, and my actual
being has been discriminated
against: all within the same space
that I found myself, that I found my
passion, that I found my future, that
I loved, that I lived, that I learned
and that I laughed in.
I still laugh. I laugh because
being able to find humor in
discomfort is my equivalence to a

-osing laughte
diamond in the rough.
My name is Zanib and I am an
ally of the #UMDivest movement.
I am a senior at this university, a
senior. Sometimes I am unsure
whether to cringe or smile over
this. A senior, I cringe as I wish I
had been involved earlier.
This is the first time I was
involved in a movement that SAFE
has pushed forward. Why now? I
witnessed my fellow students be
silenced. I watched as a crowd filled
with my best friends, my peers and
my allies were silenced. This was a
huge reality check for my previous
conceptions and perceptions of the
dynamics of my own campus.
I am no longer able to laugh.
I cannot find humor in such
discomfort.
Smiles turned to uncomfortable
looks. Open arms were closed
tight. Polite gestures became
discriminating screams. My
favorite t-shirt that reads "I feel
home" is now one I can barely look
at, let alone wear.
Home is a safe space. Home is
a comfortable space. I have never
felt so uncomfortable in my 21
years of living. I no longer "feel
home." I no longer feel safe. The
#UmDivestSitin was such an
empowering peaceful movement.
And I say that with confidence
and am allowed to make this
statement because I got to see it
for myself, every day. It was safe.
It was comforting. It felt like home.
The only "violent" part of any of
this was the horrible words from
outside forces that cut like knives
through the hearts of every single
member of this movement.

And so I wish I was involved
earlier. And so I wish I was more
informed earlier. But I am involved
now and will forever stand in
support of these courageous
individuals.
A senior, I smile as I look to
those who will continue to inspire.
The students and allies involved in
SAFE are truly the most inspiring
group of people I have had the
pleasure of being a part of. There
is nothing that can break the bonds
formed in the Edward Said Lounge.
There is nothing that can break a
movement with members as strong
as this one. So I smile. I smile that I
had the opportunity to be a part of
this as my last semester comes to a
close. I smile at my fellow peers who
will continue to work and stand
for what they believe in. I smile as
everyone who came together for
this cause did it with pure love. I
continue to smile at strangers the
same way I've done all my life; only
they no longer smile back.
I am no longer able to laugh.
I cannot find humor in such
discomfort.
We lost our safe space when
that sit-in ended. Confusion and
uneasiness swept us all, as we no
longer knew where to turn. We
could no longerleaveclass and make
our way directly to the Edward Said
Lounge; where we laughed, smiled
and cringed: together.
But I will continue to smile
because our safe space has been
recreated in each of our hearts; a
connection of love that can never
be devalued.

Don't reduce death to a
television plot device

By DREW MARON
Daily Arts Writer
"You're born alone and you die
alone and this world just drops
a bunch of rules on top of you to
make you forget those facts. But I
never forget. I'm living like there's
no tomorrow, because there isn't
one." - Don Draper, "Mad Men."
Sunday night marked the
return of one of the greatest TV
shows of all time, "Mad Men." The
second to last season coincides
with the fourth season of another
"TV Golden Age" gem, "Game of
Thrones." In evaluating a show,
one of the first things I look for
is how it treats death. I do this
mainly because too many shows
often exploit death and ultimately
cheapen it as a result.
I bring up "Mad Men" and
"Game of Thrones" as exemplary
examples not only because they're
both returning for buzz-worthy
seasons but like "Breaking Bad,"
"The Sopranos," "The Wire"
and "True Detective," death is
not used as a cliche or a "gotcha"
moment. No offense to Carter
Bays and Craig Thomas from
"HowI Met Your Mother," but the
"shocking twist" of the mother's
death somehow negated over nine
seasons of buildup by making Ted
pretty much the worst widower of
all time. If he was telling the kids
about the mother to somehow
keep her memory alive, he did a
pretty horrific job.
"Game of Thrones" and
"Mad Men" discuss death the
way it's meant to be discussed:
not as a convenient plot device
but as a harsh, universal truth.

A confession: I have never actu-
ally owned a record player. Trust
me, I've wanted to, but I've never
really been able to justify the cost
and the bulk. That probably seems
like a terrible way to lead an arti-
cle that's meant to inspire readers
to get downtown and buy physi-
cal music, but I needed to get it
out of the way. Truth is, though,
I still have a special, weird sort of
love for vinyl. I remember back
in elementary school, back when
"Indoor Recess" was a thing, I
had a teacher who brought in his
old collection of 45s - The Bea-
tles, The Rolling Stones, the hest
groups of the '60s, really - and let
us play them when we were stuck
inside on rainy days.
I was only around 11-years-
old then, but I remember need-
ing to put the needle down just
right, needing to treat the music
with respect in order to get it to
play. I remember, later on in high
school, my friend getting a hand-
me-down stereo system from his
grandpa. We listened to The Who's
Quadrophoenia in its entirety, tak-
ing in every detail of the music. A
system like that was too imposing
to ever allow you to be distracted
by the outside world.
I always buy CDs when I feel
like an album is special or worthy
enough to be able to hold in my
hand. I still call the music I listen
to "albums" or "records" - those
black vinyl disks encased in impos-
ing, statement-making artwork-
even though now they're mostly
just folders of MP3s on my com-
puter. I'm notgoingto pretendthat
there aren't enormous advantages
to being a music fan in the digi-
tal era, but the brick-and-mortar
record store is still a monument
to the days when all our music
couldn't be stashed in our pock-
ets. Thebest ones have an obvious,
endearingpersonalitytothem, like
you're walking around inside the
owner's iPod.
I never had a record store in
my hometown so I had to make
do with Dearborn Music, about
a half hour away. My trips there
when I was in high school were
ritualistic. I always brought a list
of all the albums I might possibly
want to look for; I always had to
walk up and down the aisles mul-
tiple times, double-checking all of
my favorite genres for something I

might have missed. I'd be shocked
if less than three-quarters of my
grass-cutting money went direct-
ly into their cash registers, but I
didn't care - the experience itself
was priceless.
We're so lucky in Ann Arbor.
During a time when so many
of these stores are closing their
doors, we stillhave fourbusinesses
devoted to selling physical music.
This Saturday is Record Store
Day, an event exclusive to inde-
pendent retailers, full of limited-
edition releases from some of the
best artists in the world (Nirvana,
Sam Cooke, Eric Church and The
Velvet Underground, just to name
a small few). Even if you've only
ever gotten music from iTunes or
The Pirate Bay, I encourage you to
check these landmarks out. Here
they are:
Underground Sounds -
255 E.LibertySt.
A little on the small side, and
mostly devoted to actual records
(the CDs only get a couple of
shelves), Underground Sounds
always seems to have the cutting-
edge new stuff. If you've been
wildly anticipating an album
and want to get it as soon as it's
released, definitely come here.
Its lack of depth means that you
can't spend hours browsing like
you can with some other stores,
but the taste is impeccable. I don't
think you can go wrong with any-
thing you buy there.
Encore Records -
417 E. Liberty St.
The weird thing about used
record stores is that in order for
them to be able to sell an album,
somebody else has to not want
it anymore. Encore Records is
the easiest store in Ann Arbor
to get lost in. Its shelves reach
all the way to the ceiling, each
one filled to saturation with
CDs of all kinds - just never the
one you're looking for. While
not the place for those with
a specific purchase in mind,
it's definitely the best place to
go to stumble across some old
album by a band you'd almost
forgotten. It's where you make
impulse buys and end up with
a new favorite, where you scour
the selection looking for hidden
treasure. The most adventurous of
purchasers come here.

Wazoo Records-336 State St
The store most likely to be play-
ing crazy-abrasive avant-garde
noise over the speakers and also
the store with the coolest records
ontheblock, Wazoo is the hipster's
record store (and I mean that with
love and sincerity). A small set-up
located up a flight of stairs next
to Ashley's, Wazoo is a Pitchfork-
reader's paradise, stocking only
those artists the tastemakers
approve of. Don't ask for the new
Katy Perry CD, but absolutely give
this place a visit if you want to be
up on the Next Big Thing and get
albums from music's most innova-
tive and influentialgroups.
PJ's - 617 Packard St.
Though it's apparently been
around for over 30 years, I had
honestlynever heard ofPJ'sbefore
this undertaking. That's prob-
ably because while the other three
stores are in mostly the same con-
centrated area, you're more likely
to pass PJ's on a walk to The Big
House than you are just strolling
around town. A somewhat dark
room located up some wooden
stairs that features a strong, deep
collection of music, PJ's is sort of
what I imagine "Old Ann Arbor"
was like. It's got more character
than the other three stores com-
bined. You can smell the weed as
soon as the very friendly owner
- an older hippie who clearly
participated in the golden age
of rock 'n' roll - starts chatting
with you. Anyone who wants to
talk about music for hours would
have no problem heading to PJ's
and just browsing while talking
with the owner. It is the anti-Best
Buy, the anti-Barnes and Noble.
In fact, it's basically just a dude
smoking weed and waxing about
music. Maybe that's a turn-off for
some people, but I think it's these
kinds of stores we need most.
Maybe everyone who would
read an article about record
stores already frequents these
places on the regular, and this list
won't be much help. But really,
if you're reading this, pop in on
these places the next time you're
around. You won't get algorith-
mic recommendations based on
your preferences like Pandora or
iTunes, but maybe that'll cause
you to take a chance. Your new
favorite band could be just a shelf
away.

Young Merlin.
'Jinn' actor talks A2

Local director
Ahmad draws on
Middle Eastern
mythology
By OMAR MAHMOOD
For the Daily
"In the Beginning, Three
were Created ... Man, made of
Clay. Angels, made of Light. And
a Third... made of Fire."
There could hardly be a more
thrilling opening to a film.
"Jinn," directed by Ajmal 'AJ'
Zaheer Ahmad ("It's a Mis-
match") and filmed in Ann
Arbor, centers around The Jinn,
a mysterious race which has
their origins in the depths of
Arabian folklore. Remarkably,
though, says Ahmad, no one has
yet made a Hollywood movie
about this race.
"Jinn" was filmed and pro-
duced totally in Michigan.
Shawn Walter (Dominic Rains,
"Captain America: The Winter
Soldier") is a sports car design-
er who lives in Ann Arbor with
his wife Jasmine (Serena Swan,
"Cousins"). They have an idyllic
life, a home that is far too clean
and well-kept, and a perfectly
happy young mariage together,.
Then all of a sudden a mysterious
birthday present shows up for
Shawn with a 25-year-old tape of
his father, who died when Shawn
was a toddler. Terrible things
are going to start happening to

Shawn, and he must seek out his
friends and fight back against
the forces that seek to destroy
him. It is in his blood.
This was the first major star-
ring role for the striking young
Rains and on the red carpet at
the Detroit Institute of Arts pre-
miere, he said that his work with
Ahmad was a "match made in
heaven."
There was little more telling
than when the audience burst
into applause as the screen
opened up to Shawn's footsteps
into the Law Quad, and the titles
announced 'Ann Arbor, MI.'
Rains was taken with the cam-
pus.
"I didn't have as much time
as I would have liked to explore
Ann Arbor, because we were
always so busy filming, but I fell
in love with the people there,"
Rains said. "It's a beautiful
place."
To make this folklore under-
standable for a Western audi-
ence seems a formidable task
to undertake with any kind of
budget. But as Ahmad told the
audience on the red carpet at
the premiere, the budget that
the crew was working with was
about a hundredth of what might
be expected for a major Hol-
lywood production. And that
statistic is probably the most
impressive thing about the film.
"We've shown Hollywood
that it can be done right here in
Michigan," Ajmal said.
All of the filming, editing
and special effects were done in

Michigan. Moreover, Ann Arbor
played a major role in the movie.
The Law Quad was done more
than justice, and the sweeping
panoramas of deciduous Michi-
gan canopies and the Detroit
skyline were enough to get any
Wolverine's blood pumping. An
LSA sophomore, Lance Shipp,
was involved in the tuning of the
soundtrack to give the movie a
darker feel.
Ahmad is ambitious in the
scope of the plot, and grandi-
osity does seem a trademark
of his. Why couldn't the movie
have been about a tame family
curse? Why did it have to involve
a war between the races of man
and jinn? Did there have to be
a prophecy? The director had a
ready answer, hintingat a sequel.
"The hints of a larger scheme
were seeds planted in the first
movie," he said, "(and) are going
to set the stage for a much big-
ger battle between mankind and
jinn."
The overtlyreligious post-pre-
view talks at the DIA premiere
revolved around the bringing
together of humanity under a
common understanding of good
across faiths. Ahmad forcibly
tried to bring together the three
Abrahamic faiths, using the jinn
of all things as abinding knot.
But beyond the preachy feel, it
holds that Ahmad's Exxodus Pic-
tures has brought sorely needed
attention to the film industry in
Michigan, as well as enlighten-
ing audiences to lesser-known
folklore.

on the introduction to "NY
State of Mind," the first full
song on his legendary debut
album. This week celebrates
the twentieth anniversary
of those famous words, as
Illmatic, the greatest rap
album ever made, turns two
decades old. Its legacy is still
felt today.
Nas, now a hip-hop legend,
has had a complicated career
full of missteps, but there
is no denying the impact of
his debut album. Illmatic
introduced hip-hop to a
charismatic young New
York rapper who would soon
become a worldwide star on
the strength of one album.
Nas' detailed lyrics about
the grittiness of street life
sound as authentic today as
they did in 1994. Listeners
across the country were
instantly transported to
the Queensbridge housing
projects, experiencing the

fear, pride and triumph of a
Black kid trying to make it in
Queens, New York.
Illmatic is only ten songs
long and each one is an
unimpeachable classic.
Nas has a way of bringing
small moments of real-life
into his raps through his
deeply personal rhymes. His
childhood love of the Jackson
5, for instance, makes his
escapades of gangbanging
and shootouts feel like they
actually happened. Nas is
more than a caricature.
The first full song, "NY
State of Mind," introduces
the listener to life on the
block. Tales of crackheads,
dreams of a better life and a
shootout in a building filled
with innocent children are
intensely honest meditations,
making Nas relatable even to
those who have never held a
gun or lived in squalor. The
following track isfillp.4 with
bleak nihilism, reminding
us all that "life's a bitch, and
then you die." This shocking
statement sees a 20-year-old
already world-weary from the
violence he has seen, ready to

drown his pain in a bottle or
with a blunt. Throughout the
album, there are shout outs to
Ill Will, Nas' best friend who
was shot and killed.Illmatic
is filled with reminders of
our mortality, although at
times Nas appears to possess
superhuman talent.
"The World Is Yours"
opens with some of the most
powerful lyrics ever recorded.
"I sip the Dom P, watching
Gandhi til I'm charged / Then
writing in my book of rhymes,
all the words past the margin."
This mind-bending lyricism
shows the multi-faceted
nature of Nas;even at age 20,
he is both a kid from the gutter
and a gifted intellectual. This
dual nature, coupled with his
honest delivery and his poise
behind the microphone made
Nas an emcee unlike any
other. Released at the height
of the G-Funk era,illnptic
was applar opposit gf glssy
West Coast rap. The New York
streets Nas lived on were
dirty, filled with garbage,
baseheads and dice games.
The crime-centric narratives
of Illmatic are a far cry from
the mafioso raps that were
popular with mainstream
audiences at the time, yet the
lyrics resonate deeper than
any pop-rap record.
"I rap for listeners,
bluntheads, fly ladies and
prisoners," Nas states on
"Memory Lane," showing the
diversity of his audience. Nas
made an album that anyone
can appreciate it is intricately
lyrical, sincerely personal
and a profound commentary
on the harsh realities of
street life. Illmatic's appeal
is universal. Upon its release,
the album was critically
acclaimed, earning a rare five
mic rating from The Source,
one of hip-hop's premier
magazines. This honor has
only ever been bestowed upon
15 albums, yet Nas holds two
of the top spots.
When Illmatic was
released, Nas was still living
in the same Queensbridge
housing projects that are
memorialized in his lyrics.
Today, Nas is undeniably a
rap legend. He has six chart-
topping albums, tied with
Eminem and Kanye West.
His work ethic is tireless; he
dropped his eleventh studio
album, the excellent Life Is
Good in 2012. Nas' talent is
still evident to this day, but he
has never topped the caliber
of his debut album, nor has
any other rapper. Illmatic is
simply the most perfect hip-
hop album to ever be recorded.
The flawless tapestry of
street life weaves together
gripping narratives with
eloquent lyricism, detailing
Nas' unrelenting pursuit of
success. Of course, Illmatic
also serves as a constant
reminder of how quickly life
can end. "I never sleep, cause
sleep is the cousin of death,"
raps Nas on "NY State of
Mind." Illmatic is a snapshot
of life in the Queensbridge
projects preserved throughout
time, and its honesty and

remarkable storytelling make
its greatness unequaled.

Can Wolverines overcome inconsistency at Purdue?

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan baseball team's
inconsistency is catching up with
it and it's catching up fast.
Though the
Wolverines Michian
took 2-of-3
games against at Purdue
Illinois last Matchup:

which is last
in the Mid-
American Conference standings.
Michigan has been
unpredictable, and its cold
bats and unfocused defense
have prevented the team from
followingthe script.
Bakich preaches his team's
sole goal is to win a Big Ten
Championship, and the
Wolverines will have to sweep
this weekend against Purdue if
they want to be back on track
toward the conference title - one

they haven't earned since 2008.
Friday, Michigan (6-6 Big
Ten, 16-20-1 overall) will begin
its three-game slate against the
Boilermakers (3-6, 8-24) in West
Lafayette. If the Wolverines can
clean up the inconsistencies,
they could take the series for
themselves.
"We are way too
inconsistent right now, with
great performances, average
performances and then a bad
showing," said Michigan coach
Erik Bakich. "We need to be
trending upwards - we did
that against Illinois, and then
we have- a .setback against
Eastern Michigan.
"Our biggest opponent is
ourselves."
There have been too many
discrepancies across the board
for Michigan, and with the end
of the season looming, it's more
important than ever to clean up
the mess.
First there is the pitching,
which started slow this year
and has taken baby steps toward
where itneeds tobe forreliability.
The Wolverines have
gotten their most consistent
performance on the mound from

sophomore left-hander Evan Hill,
who has put up an impressive 1.93
ERA in Big Ten play and will start
for Michigan in Friday's game.
Senior catcher Cole Martin will
be his batterymate, and together,
the two could form the defensive
resistance the Wolverines need to
build for a win. Fifth-year senior
Ben Ballentine should also make
an impact starting on Saturday.
But a stalwart defense can
only get Michigan so far in the
conference. This season, the
Wolverines' hit-or-miss offense
has been their downfall when
they are unable to string together
quality at-bats and rally behind
strong starting pitching - in
Friday's game against the Illini,
Hill allowed only one run but
Michigan was shut out, tallying
just six hits and leaving six
runners stranded.
"Hopefully we can get back
on the horse and trend upwards
again this weekend," Bakich
said. "We need to stop having as
many setbacks along the way and
start playing our best baseball
as the season is progressing and
moving towards the second half
of conference play."
Wednesday against Eastern

Michigan, junior first baseman
Kyle Jusick was the only one
to make a dent in the Eagles'
defense with a two-run bomb to
right field, and Michigan's insipid
offense left 11 runners stranded
on base.
Fortunatelyfor the Wolverines,
the Boilermakers rank at the
bottom of almost every statistic
in the Big Ten and have no star
players that stand out, with only
onebattingover.300. Left-hander
Jordan Minch, Friday's starter, is
second in the conference with
five losses.
"Purdue isn't going to give
us anything we haven't already
seen somewhere along the way,"
Bakich said.
This weekend's series could
be the fresh start Michigan
needs. Purdue is certainly of
a lower caliber than what the
Wolverines have seen thus far
in conference play. With just
three conference series left in
the season, Michigan could hit
a turning point and head in the
right direction to becoming
champions.
But for that to happen, there's
no room for error and the
inconsistency must vanish.

LUNA ANNA ARCHEY/Daily
Ben Ballentine has been a reliable force on the mound for Michigan this season.
If the Wolverines don't win the "The goal is to be firing on all
series against the Boilermakers, cylinders here moving into late
they'll be going home empty- April, May and June," Bakich
handed at the end of the regular said. "We got to have more

could always fall back to playing
softball in high school."
The switch from softball to
lacrosse wasn't an easy one, but
she was willing to accept the
challenge of learning a new sport.
Anna's athleticism and
determination helped her pick up
the game and because of all the
time she spent in the backyard
playing sports with her brother,
she was able to pick it up quickly.

always with me whenever I play."
By her sophomore year, she
began to stand out in lacrosse,
tallying 16 goals, nine assists and
scooping 19 ground balls in 23
games, helping her team to an
Illinois state championship. In
her next two seasons, Anna only
improved. She finished her senior
season with All-Conference,
All-State and U.S. Lacrosse All-

team lost its first eight games of
the season, she very easily could
have given up on the season. She
could have called it quits and
waited for the new season and
new recruits to arrive.
However, she thought back
to her brother - the grit and
determination she witnessed
of him on the playing field and
in the hospital - and with that
motivation she scored three hat
tricks against Winthrop, Penn
State and UC Davis, helping the
program to its first-ever win.
She was named the American
Lacrosse Conference Rookie of
the Week twice and now she
leads the team with 28 points,
consistingof21goals and7 assists.
"She was very deserving of
that award," Ulehla said. "Anna
is one of our hardest workers and
in those games she came up big
for us."
Though she leads the team in
statistical categories, she still has
a lot to learn due to her late start.
one thing she has really been
working on is her non-dominant
hand. In softball,she always batted
right-handed, and in basketball
she mostly used her dominant
hand to dribble. Thishas hindered
Anna's growth in learning how to
be a dual-handed threat to prevent
defenders from taking anything
away from her game.
Not only has she improved
her play on the field, but also her
leadership skills. In September,
the team voted five players to
a leadership council and Anna
was voted onto it despite her
inexperience.
"When she says something
people listen," Ulehla said. "She
is the type of player that can have
a real impact on a program but it
has got to go beyond just setting
an example. She has to go beyond
her own comfort zone, and she
has recognized that she needs to
be more vocal, more of a leader
in all different areas, not just
by example. "
Anna has excelled on the field
because she has continued to
push through any adversity. She
pushed through the adversity
of learning a new sport her
freshman year of high school
and now she has pushed her way
through learning how to play at
a consistent Division I level her
freshman year of college. With
her dedication she has helped the
team find recent success winning
its last two games.
"With my brother's passing I
am beginning to learn more and
understand that things like this
unfortunately do happen," Anna
said. "The thing I took away from
it is to put life in perspective. In
a game, I know that if we lose it
is not a big deal and a lot worse
can happen."
To Anna, competing at the
highest level is what's become
important. It's what her brother
had taught her, and it's what
Ulehla will count on when she
sends No. 9 onto the field.

Freshman midfielder Anna Scheuler switched from softball to lacrosse in high school before coming to Michigan.

to give up. When her brother
passed, Anna decided to learn
from his ways and changed her
game on the field. She decided
that she'd compete at her highest
possiblelevelatalltimesandnever
give up. His passing motivated
Anna to be more competitive and
push her through any adversity
that came her way.
Before her freshman year, she'd
always played basketball in the
winter and softball in the spring,
however, she chose to transition
from softball to lacrosse. Going
into her freshman year of high
school, she had never cradled
a ball or taken a shot on goal.
It wasn't until a family friend
convinced her to give the sport a
try that she decided she was up
for the challenge.
"I think my family was a little
sad about me switching at first
because we are a firm baseball
family," Anna said. "It was a
new sport and I felt I might as

taught her the necessary skills,
and she was able to push through
the frustration to make the varsity
team by her sophomore season, a
rarity at the Loyola Academy.
According to Michigan coach
Jennifer Ulehla, basketball
players very easily make the
transition between the two
sports due to similarities between
defensive concepts and offensive
movements. Anna, a three-time
varsity letter winner in basketball
and one of 25 basketball players
selected to the ESPN Chicago All-
Area team, fit that mold and was
able to convert sports in no time.
During her sophomore season
on the basketball team when she
was picking a jersey number, No.
41 was one of the few remaining
for her to choose, and her brother
immediately came to mind.
"I decided it was time I started
remembering my brother while
I play so I picked 41," Anna said.
"I wore it for the rest of my time

American honors after scoring
60 goals and leading Loyola to its
fifth straight state title.
When Ulehla started recruiting
Anna she could tell she was a little
rough around the edges because
she was new to the game, but
her athleticism and personality
confirmed Ulehla's belief that she
was perfect for the program.
"Once I got to knowher and her
family it was a real no-brainer,"
Ulehla said. "She not only lives her
life with such a strong character,
but obviously on top of that she
has such a competitive spirit that
I knew that I could really take her
under my wing and help develop
her into one of the best lacrosse
players in the country."
Michigan has had its ups and
downs in its first year, but Ulehla
has helped as Anna has taken the
new program by storm. After the

What to Watch for: Gophers pose first challenge

Wolverines' (9-0 Big Ten, 34-6
overall) last serious obstacle to
winning a seventh straight Big
Ten title.
The Golden Gophers (10-3,
32-6) enter the series in second
place in the Big Ten and look
to spoil Michigan's undefeated
season in conference play.
Here's what to watch for as the
Wolverines try to protect home

streak to 23 games:

Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins raves about Romero's
presence and patience at the
plate - a true compliment from
one of softball's most legendary
figures. The threat of Romero's
power is enough for multiple
teams to have intentionally
walked her to load the bases
this season.
When they do, it usually leads
to a big at-bat for sophomore
outfielder Sierra Lawrence.
Michigan's fifth hitter has
already surpassed her RBI
tally last season with 45 - she
had 38 in 2013. Lawrence also
has five home runs, and is
hitting a startling .600 with the
bases loaded.

Driesenga used to coming into a
game in the late innings.
Hutchins repeated her
strategy Wednesday, bringing
in Driesenga to close out the
last two frames of an 11-0 win
against the Chippewas.
That preparation should pay
dividends for Driesenga and
Michigan in the postseason,
when games aren't so lopsided
and the bullpen can make or
break a season.
With a much higher level
of competition coming from
Minnesota this weekend,
those types of high-pressure
situations may well be in store.
