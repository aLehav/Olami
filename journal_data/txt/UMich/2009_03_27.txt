Residents report
confusion, lack of
information after
sprinklers set off
By JILLIAN BERMAN
and JACOB SMILOVITZ
Daily News Editors
The small fire in West Quad last
night that triggered a full evacua-
tion of the residence hall has been
ruled an arson, officials said.
Department of Public Safety

Spokeswoman Diane Brownasaid an
arson in a residence hall is "highly
unusual."
"It was apparently intention-
ally set in the hallway of the lower
level," she said.
Peter Logan, spokesman for Uni-
versity Housing, said all residents
whose rooms were not directly
affected by the water damage could
return very early this morning.
Twenty students in 11 rooms
were displaced due to water dam-
age, Logan said. Those rooms are,
as of 3 p.m. this afternoon, still not
habitable due to the water.
"We're anticipating that most

of the 11 rooms that were affected
have been cleaned and will be
available for occupancy this eve-
ning," Logan said. "But if a resident
in one of those rooms feels that it is
too damp ... we'll work with them
to find temporary lodging for the
evening."
The confusion immediately fol-
lowing the evacuation was com-
pounded by an overall lack of
information reaching displaced
residents, according to several stu-
dents outside the residence hall
early Thursday morning.
West Quad resident advisor Kari
Sant said that when the alarms first

started ringing, people thought it
was a false alarm.
"This happened two weeks ago,"
she said. "And it was someone burn-
ing waffles."
Sant said officials had told resi-
dents the event was an "actual
incident" and that "everybody was
asked to evacuate for the entire
night."
LSA freshman Michael Wilinski
said residents weren't informed of
how long they would have to wait
for the clean-up to be completed.

but that got old pretty quick," he

Students abroad caught in
French political crossfire

GREEK PHILANTHROPY
With charity, Greek Week goes local

Professors on strike
after policy change
alters who controls
their research
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
University students studying
abroad in France this semester may
have gottenmore thanthey original-
ly bargained for.In addition to travel-
ingacross Europe and learningmore
about foreign cultures, students
have been caught in the crossfire of

a months-long battle between the
country's university professors and
the French government.
Since February, protest has
swelled in France surrounding
President Nicolas Sarkozy's edu-
cation reforms. Professors across
France have been cancelling class-
es, causing panic and frustration
for students concerned about com-
pleting their classes and obtaining
credits they counted on in order to
stay on track for graduation.
AccordingtoTheGuardian,aBrit-
ish newspaper, these reforms greatly
effect the research done by French
academics. University professors in
France are required to have a certain

balance of research and academic
teaching. And up until now, profes-
sors' peers determined whether or
not thatbalance was met.
But Sarkozy's education reforms
place that power into the hands of
the university presidents, enraging
French professors worried they are
losing control over their research.
University of Michigan students
studying in Aix-En-Provence, a
region in the South of France,
report they have felt the effects of
the strikes as much as any French
university student.
"The strikes have unfortunately
forced my academic program to hire

Changing course,
Greeks will donate
funds, efforts to
local charities
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
In years past, Greek Week par-
ticipants spent several days rais-
ing money for various charities,
but never got the chance to see the
impact of their donations. But this

year, Greek Week organizers are
hoping to change that by giving
the money to local charities, and
have already raising $48 thousand
to help that cause.
In addition to donating money,
participants are also giving their
time and service to local charities,
including the campus group Will
Work for Food.
Nursing senior Dayna Brooks,
one of the co-directors of Greek
Week, said this shift is benefi-
cial for both participants and the
charities they are helping.
"It's really great to just get

involved," she said. "Not just to
donate moneybecause alotofpeo-
ple just do that. We've really been
focusing this year on service and
giving back to the community."
Steven Weinberg, LSA senior
and president of Will Work For
Food, said he is excited to partner
with the Greek community for
the week because the push to help
local charities through both time
and money is at the core of his
group's mission.

MKHIGAN STUDENT ASSEMBLY
New MSA heads seek tranispareilcy

Mahanti, Rorro to
rework MSA website,
make it easier to use
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
During the hotly contested cam-
paign to lead the Michigan Student
Assembly, Abhishek Mahanti and
Mike Rorro promised to increase
the assembly's accountability and
transparency, if elected.

Now that the race is over, the
pair has started to take their cam-
paign slogans and make them more
concrete.
Rorro said all of the changes
they have in the works have to do
with using the assembly's resourc-
es to cater only to students' direct
needs.
"Going forward into the next
year, our primary goal, as it was in
the campaign, is to bring students
back to the assembly, a place where
people see it as a resource, where
they see their representatives

as public servants," Rorro said.
"Everything that we do is based on
the question, 'Have we made stu-
dent life better here at Michigan
through passing this resolution or
going out and doing this event or
funding this group?"'
Mahanti said one of the most
important changes inbringing about
this increased focus on student
needs is revamping MSA's website,
which he said should be finished by
the beginning of the fall semester.

WASHINGTON
More U.S. troops
sent to Afghan war
Confronting an inherited and fal-
tering war, President Barack Obama
plans to dispatch thousands more
military and civilian trainers to
Afghanistan by the fall on top of the
17,000 combat troops he has already
ordered, senior administration offi-
cials said yesterday.
Obama's war strategy, which
will he announce today, includes no
timeline for withdrawal of troops.
The war began more than seven
years ago.
As he plans to put more U.S. lives
andmoneyintothewarzoneObama
will set benchmarks for progress in
Afghanistan and neighboring, trou-
bled Pakistan. The goal is to show
Congress and the American people
that the strategy is working - and
to set a clear framework for making
corrections as needed.
Obama also will call for increas-
ing aid to Pakistan as long as its
leaders confront militants in the
border region. The U.S. will launch
an intensive and expanded diplo-
matic effort to gain international
cooperation, including reaching out
to Russia, China, India, Saudi Ara-
bia and even Iran.

Obama plans to
raise fuel efficiency
standards by 2 mpg
The Obama administration
plans to raise fuel efficiency stan-
dards by 2 miles per gallon to 27.3
mpg for new cars and trucks in the
2011 model year, marking the first
increase in passenger car standards
in more than two decades.
Under the changes, which are
slightly less stringent than those
proposed by the Bush administra-
tion, new passenger cars will need
to meet 30.2 mpg for the 2011 model
year and pickup trucks, sport utili-
ty vehicles, and minivans will need
to reach 24.1 mpg, an administra-
tion official told The Associated
Press yesterday. The official spoke
on condition of anonymity because
the person was not authorized to
speak in advance of an announce-
ment expected today.
The fuel efficiency rules are the
first step in meeting a 2007 energy
law that will require car makers to
meet at least 35 mpg by 2020, a 40
percent increase over the current
standard of about 25 mpg.

Michigan Senate
OKs stimulus road,
bridge spending
Michigan road and bridge con-
struction is poised to get an $847
million boost now that state law-
makers have approved legislation
authorizing spending federal stim-
ulus dollars.
The state Senate unanimously
passed a bill yesterday that allows
the state to receive and spend
stimulus cash for transportation
projects. The House already has

approved the measure so it soon
should be on its way to Gov. Jenni-
fer Granholm for her signature.
That will allow the state to begin
entering into contracts for the
work, much of which will be done
this construction season. It will
add to state road and bridge spend-
ing that was expected to be about
$1.5 billion this fiscal year.
The transportation bill includes
$635 million for main state high-
ways and bridges and $212 million
for local road departments. Anoth-
er $26 million goes to other areas,
including bus transit and freight
projects.

Record flood levels

Officials in North Dakota have
ordered a mandatory evacuation
of one Fargo neighborhood and
a nursing home after authorities
found cracks in an earthen levee
built around the area.
Authorities say the evacuation
late Thursday is a precaution and
that the 40 homes in the River Vili
neighborhood are not in immedi-
ate danger. They say no water has
breached the levee.
They also say Riverview Estates
nursing home is being evacuated.
The number of residents affected
isn't immediately clear.

casters said the Red River could

Brand name
birth control to
see big price dip

President Barack Obama holds an 'Open For Questions' town hall style meeting in the East Room of the White House in
Washington yesterday. It was the first online town hall done in the White House. The town hall came on the same day that
his budget proposal won a key committee vote in the United States Senate.

NuvaRing, also priced at $50 per
cycle, do not have generic equiva-
lents, Chivers said.
Dr. Susan Ernst, chief of gyne-
cology services at'UHS, said that
although most patients switched
to the generic brand of their birth
control product, for those patients
on products like the NuvaRing,
switching to a different form of
contraception was not always the
best option.
Ernstsaid the NuvaRing"is one of
those itemsthat really became unaf-
fordable for some patients," and that
because there is no generic alterna-
tive, patients would have to switch
to a pill form of contraception.
Despite the increase in pricing
for many brand-name contracep-
tive products, Ernst said she did
not see a decrease in patients' use
of birth control altogether.
"I really don't feel like patients
didn't use contraception because
of that problem," Ernst said. "I feel
like we were able to find something
that was acceptable to them and
often that was a generic because
we could give them a lower price."
But for some students, generic
products were not always advised.
Engineering sophomore Lianna
Gordon started getting her birth
control product from UHS in 2008.
But after switching to the birth
control pill Yaz, her doctor advised
her not to switch to the generic
brand when prices rose.
Gordon said she stopped buy-
ing Yaz from UHS, because the

price was $50, double the price she
would pay for the same product at
The Village Apothecary located at
1112 South University Ave.
But Gordon said if drug compa-
nies reinstated the discounts with
college health clinics, she would
reconsider where she purchases
her birth control.
"If they're doing discounts
through the school, then yeah, I
would definitely go through UHS,"
Gordon said.
Chivers said that on the same
day UHS received the news thatthe
federal budget bill could potential-
ly lower the price of birth control
products, it called the drug compa-
nies to inquire about reinstatingthe
contracts that would provide them
with the discounted prices.
"I'm just hoping they will think
very positively about how we can
move forward with the new lan-
guage and be able to roll back the
price,"Chiverssaid."But that can'tbe
guaranteed because it will all revolve
around the manufacturer and how
they choose to handle this."
Lisa Ellen, spokeswoman for
New Jersey-based drug company
Schering-Plough, said the corpo-
ration has not come to any con-
crete decisions about reinstating
contracts but is looking into the
possibility of doing so for certain
contraceptive products, includ-
ing the popular birth control pill
Desogen.
"Overall we're looking into the
pricing and the legislation," Ellen
said. "We have not made any final
decisions but we're evaluating it."

Obama's proposal
wins key committee
vote along party lines
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Democrats pushed a recession-
era budget backed by the Obama
administration through com-
mittee yesterday after rejecting
Republican attempts to cut spend-
ing and reduce mammoth deficits.
The 13-10 vote was along party
lines in the Senate Budget Com-
mittee, and came as GOP critics
sharpened their attacks on a plan
that Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama
derided as "the most irrespon-
sible budget in the history of the
Republic."
The plan calls for spending
of $3.5 trillion for the year that
begins Oct. 1, and assumes a

He added that Greek Week's
unique format also motivated him
to work with the organization.
"We were drawn to the social
and competitive aspects ofthe com-
munity service work done during
Greek Week," he said. "We want to
build upon this idea of making com-
munity service something social
thatyou can do with friends."
Rachael Reeves, president of
the Panhellenic Association, said
she was very "impressed" with
Greek Week's dedication to help
local charities.
"While it is always great how
much money we raise as a commu-
nity, it is also important to have a

David, an LSA junior and student
in the Aix-En-Provence program,
wrote in an e-mail interview.
Because of the situation and
uncertainty about regular class
meetings, many students are
concerned about fulfilling neces-
sary credits at the University of
Michigan.
"My concern was that I wasn't
going to receive credit for my
courses," LSA junior Sonita Moss,
whois alsointheAix-En-Provence

increases for hundreds of domes-
tic programs and clears the way
for major legislation later in the

priorities of health care, energy
and education.
Despite their criticism, Senate
Republicans have said they do not
intend to propose an alternative to
the Democrats' budget, a decision
that spares them the need to make
politically difficult choices.
Republicans conceded thatSen.
Kent Conrad, D-N.D., chairman
of the committee, had produced
a plan that sliced recommended
spending beneath levels Obama
requested less than a month ago,
with lower deficits projected as a
result.
But some said he had not gone

that the budget lacked the type

March 23 until April 1, pits 13 teams

participants to raise money.
As a supplement to Greek Week
this year, participants took part
in the first annual Service Day,
which allowed about 300 volun-
teers to get directly involved with
local charities.
Brooks said Service Day gave
students the chance to do some-
thing besides the typical Greek
Week events.
"I also think the members of the
Greek community were excited to
do something other than participat-
ing in competitive events such as
State Street Day and Diag Day," she
said. "Our first annual Service Day
allowed over 300 individuals to help

and Ypsilanti complete projects that

The University's Office of
International Programs is trying
to keep students aware of current
developments. The OIP has set up
a page on its website for students
studying abroad to get informa-
tion and has been in contact with
on-location program directors.
In an e-mail interview, Nicole
LeBlanc, assistant director at the
UniversityofMichigan's OIP,wrote
that fulfillingcredits in the wake of
the strikes is no longer a concern.
"(Fulfilling credits) should not
be an issue, based on the current
academic plan in place which will
give students a full semester of

of enforcement measures needed
to make sure the targets aren't
exceeded in future years.
Sessions' attempt to cut an
additional $200 billion from non-
defense domestic programs over
five years was defeated on a party-
line vote, 13-10.
Conrad responded that he
already had trimmed spending
below Obama's request by $160
billion over five years and had
reduced the deficit by two-thirds
over the same period. He said Ses-
sions' proposal would have frozen
spending in particularly worthy
programs like veterans services
"at a time when we have large

LSA senior Liz Henley, co-
director of Greek Week, said the
shift to more service was one
of the main goals for this year's
Greek Week.
"When Dayna and I were
appointed as co-directors, one of
our big goals for Greek Week 2009

"If an OIP student should find

While the situation caused

what are we supposed to do?'
"We just wish someone would
tell us what's goingon," he said.
Engineering sophomore Keith
Lamprecht expressed similar dis-
pleasure with the amount of infor-
mation authorities were getting to
the residents.
"They don't reallytell us awhole
lot and I kind of thought they
would," he said. "They haven't
really done anything for us besides
tell us to go to South Quad."
West Quad resident and Nurs-
ing freshman Breann Eckerle was
on the ninth floor of South Quad
hanging out in the hallway, wait-
ing for word on the situation in her
residence hall.
She said she was passing the
time by people watching, but was
"tired" and getting "pissed" about
the situation.
"I wish there was somewhere
we could sleep," she said.
Clean-up has been underway
since the incident occurred early
this morning, Brown said.
Logan said there was a delay
in getting residents back in their
rooms because of air quality
tests.
"The fire marshall did require
that we conduct an air quality
test for the safety of the students

because any time you have build-
ing material ina combustion it can
create fumes that could be discom-
forting," Logan said.
Logan said University Housing
is also adding $10 in Blue Bucks
to the accounts of each resident
affected by the water infiltration
into their -rooms, to assist with
laundry expense.
The residence hall's sprinkler
system quickly extinguished the
small fire, Brown said.
The cafeteria in South Quad,
which is directly across Madi-
son Street from West Quad, was
opened for West Quad residents
during the clean-up.
Brown said the incident took
place on the lowest level of the
building, which usually makes it
easier to contain.
Police Sergeant Michelle Chatell,
who was on the scene early Thurs-
daymorning, declined to comment.
Brown said there hadbeen some
flooding on the first floor because
once a sprinkler is activated, all
the water in its pipes has to come
down. Cleaning up that water,
Brown said, usually takes a long
time.
The University is offering a
reward of up to $500 for infor-
mation leading to the success-
ful arrest and prosecution of the
person or persons involved in the
arson. Anyone with information is
being asked to contact University
Police at (734) 763-1131.

A deadly option
The use of Tasers in police situations must be rethought
t's true that firearms are the weapon typically associated with
the term "deadly force." But the recent death of a teenage boy
in Bay City at the hands of police officers wasn't caused by
a gun - it was caused by an officer's Taser. Though Tasers come
with the assumption that they don't cause permanent harm, the
incident should serve as a reminder that Tasers are anything but
harmless. Tasering can have serious, even life-threatening effects.
Police agencies should recognize this danger and put an end to pol-
icies that encourage the use of this unpredictable weapon.

The science of science

Last Sunday, a 15-year-old in Bay City
was killed when a police officer Tasered
him. According to the police statement, the
officer responsible and one other were try-
ing to break up a fight between the boy and
another man. The boy resisted and the offi-
cer Tasered him, intending to immobilize
the teenager. Instead, the Taser killed him.
The boy was pronounced dead at a hospital
a short time later.
Admittedly, not all the facts about what
exactly happened are available yet, and if
the State Police investigation discovers
that the officer acted inappropriately, he
should be held accountable. But it seems
like the officers responded to the situation
in an appropriate manner.
And that's the problem - even when
used in the correct circumstances, Tasers
are inherently flawed. Tasers are clearly
much more dangerous than people consid-
er them to be. It's a faulty tool - one that
policy agencies across the country should
seriously reconsider.
According to Taser International, more
than 5,000 police agencies use Tasers,
despite evidence that shows they can be
unsafe. The death toll related to Taser-

ing between 2001 and 2007 now exceeds
220, according to Amnesty International.
Despite the fact that Tasers are unreliable
technology, law enforcement policies do
not reflect this reality, making police offi-
cers more likely to use them.
The biggest problem with Tasers is that
they're simply too easy to use. It's true
that discharging a firearm is easy, too -
all police have to do is aim and squeeze
the trigger. But police officers are aware
of all the consequences that result from
shooting someone. Because Tasers are
considered to be the responsible, "safe"
option, police use them with less caution.
And though there are times when police
officers must defend themselves and oth-
ers, they need to be aware that firing a
Taser can result in the same complica-
tions as firing a gun.
While plenty of attention has been paid
to the incidents in which police Tasered
people for no good reason, it's important to
remember that sometimes, even responsi-
ble uses of Tasers can go awry. Until police
protocol reflects this reality, the number of
unintentional Taser deaths will continue
to increase.

Science dominates the world
today. The fact that technol-
ogy is almost always viewed as
either evil incar-
nate or humanity's
savior is proof of
that. But there is
a fatal flaw with
leaningon science's
gift to us, technol-
ogy - most laymen
don't understand
what good scienceB
is. Science cannot BEN
prove anything CALECA
without a doubt,
and it is through
rigorous review of scientific research
and through skepticism of new dis-
coveries, that we better explain how
our world is governed.
An amusing recent example of not
understanding science comes from
the Large Hadron Collider located in
Switzerland. This 26-kilometer cir-
cumference ring contains a particle
accelerator capable of (hopefully)
finding the theorized but not as of yet
detected Higgs Boson, a subatomic
particle that in theory gives matter
mass. This, of course, bored the pub-
lic. After all, it's not exactly the kind
of thing that's very tangible to some-
one not interested in the subject. The
public was excited about the sugges-
tion by scientists that the particle
accelerator could form black holes of
an infinitesimal size.
The panic that followed was an
embarrassing show of ignorance.
Instead of asking what threat these
black holes posed, they assumed it
must be the stereotypical giant vor-
tex of death you might find in a bad
sci-fi movie. According to a world-
news.com.au article, a girl in India
watching her local station warn of
this possible global catastrophe
drank insecticide rather than risk
being around for the world to end

(Teen commits suicide after 'end of
world' reports, 11/11/2008). Scien-
tists from the European Organiza-
tion for Nuclear Research (CERN),
the particle physics laboratory
that runs the accelerator, tried to
explain the nature of what was real-
ly at stake.
So what of those horrific black
holes? They are so small, they would
not even be able to suck in a few mol-
ecules of air before evaporating into
nothing. Even more comically, the
science that says it could happen at
the LHC also supports the idea that
similar black holes can and probably
already do form and then disappear
randomly in our atmosphere. What
the scientists couldn't do to assuage
tinfoil-hatted naysayers was assure
that there was zero risk of the LHC
destroying the Earth.
This is where people'need to bet-
ter understand science and scien-
tific theory. A theory in science is an
explanation, with facts supportingits.
validity through observation. Theo-
ries aren't set in stone, nor can they
ever be, because scientific develop-
ments are fundamentally self-criti-
cal and skeptical. Scientists in good
conscience can never say a giant vor-
tex of death cannot possibly form,
because there is a slight chance that
it can. Then again, it is possible the
next time you go swimming you'll be
struck by lightning during a shark
attack, even in a lake.
Those who mock natural selection
as only being theory fail to realize
the inherent fluidity and uncertainty
of science. Germ theory and the cell
theory are just theories as well, still
vulnerable to being found incomplete
or perhaps even incorrect. All three
theories have evolved, so to speak,
over decades into more refined forms
that can broadly explain the natural
world. They are stronger than any
other theories because they are scru-

tinized so closely and are backed up
by experimental evidence and obser-
vationthat other theories donot have.
Theories almost always change and
develop, but often they remain useful
to predict natural phenomena.
Not every black
hole is a giant
vortex of death.

Inexperimentation, scientistshope
to prove their own work correct. But
more is often learned in the mistakes
scientists make, or in accidentally
' proving an exception to the accepted
theory. Exceptions are sometimesdue
to experimental error, but they some-
times show flaws that are valuable
to scientists looking to perfect their
work. All science has bias, such as
confirmation bias by narrow-minded
but driven researchers, but through
peer review of work and independent
confirmation of experimental results
we can filter out biased observations.
In the false name of science, ped-
dlers of useless items like magnetic

undermine scientific advancement to
suit political or religious beliefs use
unscientific arguments to "prove"
their claims. It is important for us to
be vigilant as a society to claims and
movements founded on outrageous
beliefs or faulty evidence. Part of this
takes better understanding of what
it means to be scientific. Caution and ,
skepticism mean more in the long run
than any idea that hasn't been - or is
unable to be - tested.

Love isn' tjust black and white

Despite valid arguments,
child labor isn't the answer
TO THE DAILY:
I appreciated hearing the viewpoint of Ibra-
him Kakwan concerning child labor ('Fair
trade' tragedy, 03/26/2009). His perspective as
a former resident of El Salvador is one that we
do not often hear at the University.
I am sure it is true that impoverished chil-
dren who do not have access to jobs in manu-
facturing or farming are more likely to turn
to prostitution or to gangs in order to survive.
However, this fact does not lead me to feel that
I should support multinational companies that
use child labor.
Instead, it strengthens my resolve to work
to ensure that children in developing countries
have greater access to education and resourc-
es. It makes me feel even more strongly that
I should show my support for legislation like
the Education for All Act, which would assist
developing nations in ending the school fees
that keep many impoverished children from
getting an education.
In addition, I know companies that use child
labor will likely not miss my business, as they
tend to make large profits. I feel that my money
is better spent on clothing made in worker-
owned cooperatives or on fair-trade certified
coffee.
The companies who make these goods are
more likely to pay their workers livable wages,
enabling their children to attend school and
not have to work in a factory or join a gang to
survive. !
I feel that the money I spend on these goods
has a far greater positive impact than money
spent on sweatshop-produced merchandise
ever could.

Earth Hour exemplifies
anti-progressive principles
TO THE DAILY:
This Saturday night, millions of people
around the world will be shutting off their
lights from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. to partici-
pate in Earth Hour, supposedly spreading the
message about reducing human impact on the
environment.
Before you shut off your lights, consider

the message you are sending.-By flipping that
switch, you endorse the movement for man to
withdraw, to stop changing the environment,
and to exist in a primitive, "natural" state.
Instead, participate in Edison Hour by turn-
ing on your lights during this hour in celebra-
tion of human progress and achievement.
. Before you condemnthe idea for being waste-
ful, think about what you mean by "waste."
Something that is "wasted" is used without an
adequate return.
We are using our energy in celebration of
the wonders of technology and an industrial
society. While too many people are sitting in
the darkness, perhaps trying to read by light
from their (mass-produced) candles, we will
be enjoying the freedom and safety provided by
the effort of man.
While the goal of efficiency is an admirable
one, the sacrifice of humanity suggested by
Earth Hour is not a solution. Efficiency and
the move toward sustainability should focus on
using fewer resources and less energy for the
same processes, not forcing us to give up the
things that we value.
Are you willing to surrender your laptop,
your heated house, your electric lights and
everything else you use daily just to reduce
your carbon footprint?
Will you return to a hunter-gatherer exis-
tence just to stop the human modification of
the environment?
As much as I would like to stop burning fos-
sil fuels since the by-products are bad for my
body, I value my modern conveniences enough
that I am willing to take that risk. If you are
not willing to do the same, you are welcome to
leave industrial society.
If you have a real commitment to efficient
development, consider purchasing "greener"
products and services.
Yes, you will probably pay more. Yes, your
product may be inferior in quality to the less
"eco-friendly" version.
However, spending your money is a personal'
choice and an investment. It will provide funds
and demonstrate a consumer demand for effi-
ciency so that newer, better products will be
developed.
As for nie: when these "green" products stop
asking me to sacrifice, I will happily switch,
but not before. For now, I plan to turn on my
lights and celebrate the current state of our
beautifully industrialized, pollution-creating
society during Edison Hour, and I hope you do
the same.

s black men who spent nine
months in a white woman's
womb, Obama and I have
something in common. We are the
beautiful progeny
of interracial rela-
tionships, a part of
a growing trend.
Multiracial couples
are simultaneously
loved by Ameri-
cans who dream
of a day when race
discrimination MATTHEW
ceases to exist MATTEW
and resented by HUNTER
people who reject
the prospect of
becoming romantically involved with
another to whom they cannot cultur-
ally relate.
According to Time Magazine,
interracial marriages have increased
almost 1,000 percent between the
ban of anti-miscegenation laws in
1967 and 2003 (Color-Blind Love,
5/12/2003). "Mmixing of the races"
is inevitable. Considerations about
maintaining racial loyalty when
searching for one's mate might be
more productively discussed in the
context of negotiating complexities
involved with interracial relation-
ships.
Interracial couples cannot escape
the scrutiny of outspoken intra-
breeders. Amongthe mostprominent,
and perhaps the most legitimate, of
those who oppose some form of inter-
racial dating are black women. In a
2006 essence.com survey, 53 percent
of readers disapproved of seeing a
black man with a white woman.
To strengthen their case, black
women cite the statistics of "ineli-
gible" black men. According to the
University's 2008 enrollment statis-
tics, black women make up 60 per-
cent of the African American student
population. Combine that with the
201,000 black male-white female
marriages, as determined by the U.S.
Census Bureau, gays and the incar-
cerated, and hopes for an eligible
black man understandably decrease.
All of these factors account for the

increase of black female-white male
relationships.
Similarly, black men seem to usu-
ally prefer black women. But in
social spaces dominated by whites,
the number of white women far out-
weighs that of black women. The
most likely candidate for a significant
other is then usually a white woman.
It is a rare man who, during his free
time, struggles to search far and wide
for the ideal black woman for the sake
of "staying loyal" to one's race.
Given that black men and women
who date outside of their race are
a growing minority group, practi-
cal questions arise. How can blacks
negotiate the issue of finding the
ideal white man or woman? How
can whites better understand why
they are usually not the first choice?
If they are the first choice, what cul-
tural negotiations might be made to
satisfy critics' questions? What sac-
rifices might whites make to experi-
ence the gain of one's black partner?
The Time Magazine article also
discussed the case of Chip, a white
man who was raised to be racist. He
fell in love with a black co-worker,
Yvette. Chip's father hasn't talked to
him since, and Chip's daughter said
that it was confusing when her dad
was the only white man at family
gatherings. But a child's confusion
can transform into wisdom. As their
13-year-old daughter said, "I feel
special because I can see the world
through black and white eyes both."
I have a few suggestions for inter-
racial couples. First, no one should
ignore race. Discussions of race and
politics should be on the front lines of
communication. Conversations about
identity, slavery, racism and race
education for children are essential
discourse. Second, each person must
attempt to better understand the
other's families. Having both white
and black families, I know that they
can be equally crazy but also equally
loving.
To black men: understand why the
sisters can be frustrated with you. To
black women: black men should be
with whomever they choose, so be

easy.
To whites; there are a few racial
issues that can easily create tension.
One such issue is the stereotypes of
white women being sexually over-
whelmed by black men. In a 2005
New York Press article entitled "A
White Woman Explains why she Pre-
fers Black Men," Susan Bakos claims
that she will never go back to white
men because, "that phrase, 'Once
you go black, you never go back' is
all about the feeling of the skin." She
continues, "I want black men. They
want me. We look at one another and
exchange a visible frisson of sexual
energy in the lingering glances. And
our attraction is based first on race."
The challenges
interracial couples
face today.
Lastly, white men should be care-
fulnot to treat a black partner as their
"ethnic prize." This subtle objectifi-
cation reminds many blacks of Jose-
phine Baker and of white men with
a long history of emphasizing the
"unique sexuality" of black women.
There is much to be gained from
datingoutside one's race. But because
racial stereotypes and tensions are
still so prominent, we must tread
carefully so as not to let society
determine the fate of interracial rela-
tionships. Limitation to one race is 4
not only sometimes impractical, but
also often restrictive of one's own
ability to share and learn from deep
relationships with others. I think our
openness to view the racial boundar-
ies of relationships on a continuum of
great possibility rather than binary
opposites will make this long transi-
tion into a nation of multiracial babies
much easier.

All-out aural 'Blitz!'

The Yeah Yeah Yeahs go
avant-garde and play off
retro music cliches
By WHITNEY POW
Senior Arts Editor
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are more baffling than
your average band. In an attempt to hype up
its third studio release It's
Blitz!, YYYs released a series ***
of short films called the
"SNAKESWEAT TRILOGY." Yeah Yeah
The films, according to the YeahS
band's blog, provide an inti-
mate look into the "day to day It's Blitz!
recording activities" involved DGC/Interscope
in the making of its music.
The films themselves, how-
ever, are crazy and avant-garde: They're filmed
in black and white, set in the desert and star
guitarist Nick Zinner setting Barbie dolls on
fire and drummer Brian Chase doing yoga on
an industrial oil drum. Perhaps the films really
do document YYYs's daily recording routines,
but, then again, probably not.
One might venture to guess that It's Blitz!,
the album the odd "SNAKESWEAT" films
endorse, is similarly ironic. Just as the films
play off avant-garde art cliches, the album
plays off retro music cliches - namely dance

music of the '70s and '80s - with an abun-
dance of kick-drum-heavy beats, an excess of
Enya-like synths and twangy disco guitars.
The sound is a step removed from sophomore
album Show Your Bones's acoustic center,
and it's a leap away from first studio album
Fever To Tell's art-house rock. But It's Blitz!
is still infused with the previous albums'
penchant for the dark and brooding hidden
beneath catchy melodies and sexy vocals. It's
a welcome move toward a more genre-specific
sound that, while playing off cliches, is ironi-
cally fresh.
It's Blitz! doesn't try to appropriate disco
music per se, but instead creates a moody,
dark parody of it; it's a dance album filmmak-
er David Lynch (in his "Blue Velvet" period)
would have made had he possessed the musi-
cal chops. While the album contains a copious
amount of upbeat dance grooves, its lyrics,
sung by the versatile Karen 0, are hauntingly
ironic and oddly macabre. On "Heads Will
Roll," while Chase knocks out a "Heart of
Glass"-like beat, Olashes out, honey-sweetand
reverb-heavy, "Off with your head / Dance 'till
you're dead / Heads will roll / on the floor."
Songs like "Soft Shock" and "Dull Life"
showcase O's voice as an essential instru-
mental component backing the drums and
guitars; her voice presents the album with a
necessary driving force with its sharp breathy
intonations and deep-throated moans. Still,
certain songs on the album lose their momen-

tum when the band tries to back-track and
revisit sounds from previous albums. "Skel-
etons," with its calming, atmospheric synths
and sparse drummer-boy percussion, tries
too hard to imitate YYYs's single "Maps" with
heartfelt yet overly reminiscent lyrics: "Love
my name / love left dry / Frost or flame / skel-
eton me."
Another such song is "Shame and Fortune,"
which revisits Show Your Bones's sound with
its loud, fuzz-heavy guitar lines and plain,
predictable rhythmic beat that doesn't strive
to achieve It's Blitz!'s twisted retro dance
sound.
The album, however, makes intriguing
headway on tracks including "Dragon Queen,"
where YYYs consciously uses harp plucks and
Bee Gees-reminiscent disco guitars to create
a dark dance feel, and "Zero," which relies
on addictively droning keyboards and Moog
synths.
It's Blitz!'s movement towards a new sound
is a welcome one, but the band on occasion
slips back into safer territory, preferring, at
times, sounds that've been done before. Per-
haps a more gutsy move into dance territory
would have made the album much more out-
standing, but YYYs has already cemented
itself into an art-rock oddity not only with its
Barbie-melting film series but with It's Blitz!'s
conscious foray into uncharted musical terri-
tories that still retains the band's characteris-
tically macabre feel.

"Kings," NBC's overly ambi-
tious attempt at retelling the bibli-
cal story of David
and Goliath, is*
essentially a soap
opera dressed in .n
prime-time dra-
ma's clothing. The Sundays at
plot is complex 8 p.m.
and occasionally NBC
baffling, making
the rewind func-
tion on a DVR more necessary than
ever. But its allegorical overtones
and resonating themes eventually
make it something more than just
arcane melodrama.
The two-hour premiere intro-
duced an alternate reality, a sort
of pseudo-New York City in which
King Silas Benjamin (Ian McShane,
"Deadwood"), ruler of the nation of
Gilboa, unveils his newly built capi-
tal city of Shiloh. Silas continuously
waxed poetic about the moment
God told him he would be king, and
a group of butterflies landed on his
head in the shape of a crown (view-
ers were beaten over the head with
this symbolism throughoutthe pre-
miere).
All of a sudden, it was two years
later, and viewers were intro-
duced to newly war-torn Gilboa
through the eyes of David Shep-
herd (Christopher Egan, "Resident
Evil: Extinction"), the aptly named
populist hero with a heart of gold, a
love for his country and an uncanny
resemblance to Matt Damon.
David and his brother Eli
(MichaelMosley, "The Insurgents")
are Gilboa's answer to white trash
- the siblings initially lived athome
with their mother and ran a car
repair business out of their garage.
The two are now ridiculously moral
and good-natured soldiers fight-
ing against the northern nation
of Gath. When Jack, King Silas's
whiny playboy of a son (Sebastian
Stan, "Law & Order"), was taken
hostage by Gath's soldiers, David
defied his superiors' orders and ran
haphazardly across the border into
the looming headlights of Gath's
tank, predictably named Goliath.
David wasrewarded handsomely
by King Silas, who threw him a lav-
ish banquet, allowed himto date his
daughter Michelle (Allison Miller,
"17 Again"), and gave him a shitty
apartment in Shiloh where he'll
work as army liaison to the press.
Naturally, country boy David was

uncomfortable with all the atten-
tion and all them crazy city folk,
and he spent the rest of the episode
either silent or enigmatically poet-
ic. Conflict ensued when it became
apparent that not everyone in Gil-
boa is on David's side, including
Silas himself.
In any other time or place, this
show may have been solely ridicu-
lous. And in some ways, it still is.
The premiere got off to a slow start,
but divulged shocking plot develop-
ments at an alarmingly rapid rate
during the second hour. We found
out within a matter of minutes that
Jack is gay and Silas has been hav-
ing an affair for years, has an ille-
gitimate son and married his wife
for the financial support of her
brother - who's now refusing to let
him end the war with Gath.
The head-spinning duplicity of
every single character is enough to
make our own reality seem almost
inviting. And unfortunately, the
most cringe-inducing moient
occurred in the very last scene,
when David found himself sur-
rounded by you guessed it - a

meets dystopia.
group of butterflies, descending
upon his head in the shape of a
crown while Silas looks on in hor-
ror. "Kings" manages to simultane-
ously echo Shakespeare, the "Bible"
and "The O.C."
And somehow, in 2009, "Kings"
manages to feel relevant. It has
all of the right allegorical ingredi-
ents: There's the nameless, faceless
enemy and the completely inexpli-
cable war; there's the young idealist
demonstrating the futility of fight-
ing to stop a war that's being waged
for all of the wrong reasons; there's
the bright, initially flawless leader
with dark secrets and complicated
interpersonal relationships; and
finally, there's the premiere's end-
ing, which hinted at a sharp and
protracted economic downturn for
Gilboa.
Despite its soapy overtones and
potentially outlandish plot, "Kings"
runs deep, hitting some of the right
nerves. Its intellectually developed
characters, oft-believable dialogue
and timely subject matter save it
from being too much of a guilty
pleasure.

An animation celebration at the AAFF

By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
The short films of Oscar-nom-
inated animator Don Hertzfeldt
employ varying
degrees of seri-
ousness. Some An Evening
shorts, like his wjt Don
absurdist black Hertzeldt
comedy "Billy's
Balloon" (about Tonightat
a child's balloon 7 p.m
that tortures its At the Michigan
owner), are just
meant to make
people laugh. Others, like his four-
years-in-the-making opus "The
Meaning of Life," leave audiences
amazed and in awe of the sheer
creativity and animation prowess
on display.
Then there's the darker side of
Hertzfeldt - the side responsible
for his 2006 Sundance winner
"everything will be ok" and its
sequel, the just-released "i am so
proud of you."
. Both films follow the sad,
strange journey of Bill, a stick
figure who lives every day of
his life in exactly the same way

until he suffers a mental break-
down and must compromise his
suddenly meaningless existence
with the possibility of death. The
films reflect the grim thoughts
of a man shaken out of his banal
state of mind to confront his own
mortality, and their dark nature
stands in direct contrast to the
bright and chipper exteriors of
most mainstream animation. Yet,
on closer inspection, perhaps all
of Hertzfeldt's work shares this
bleak motif.
"I think all of (my films) are
coming from more or less the same
place," Hertzfeldt wrote in an
e-mail interview. "A friend once
pointed out that the chain between
all the films, beneath the comedy,
is 'quiet dread' ... which sounds
like an underground goth band.
But I don't know, maybe it's true."
"i am so proud of you" will be
holding its regional premiere
tonight at 7 p.m. at the Michigan
Theater, when the Ann Arbor Film
Festival presents its program "An
Evening with Don Hertzfeldt."
The event will showcase many
selections from the filmmak-
er's past and present, including

By JOHN A. WEISS, JR.
Daily StaffReporter
The founder of the well-known
and often-used Internet radio ser-
vice Pandora will discuss the music
resource's development and inno-
vative business model on campus
today.
MPowered, the University's stu-
d in noip nniiz.

the michigan daily

Pandora, a free online radio
website, makes use of the Music
Genome Project to tailor custom
playlists based on users' preferenc-
es like favorite song or artist. It also
highlights lesser-known artists by
playing songs with similar attri-
butes to users' favorites.
Westergren will be speaking at
3:30 p.m. in Stamps Auditorium on
North Campus. A reception open to
the public will follow.
The event is part of a confer-
ence for Entreprelliance, a national
entrepreneurship organization of
which MPowered is a member.
It also will double as MPowered's
Entrepreneurship Hour for the
week, a one-credit seminar course

in the College of Engineering that
exposes students from across cam-
pus to a variety of business leaders
and innovators.
This is the fifth annual Entreprel-
liance Conference, the yearly con-
vention for an organization that
recognizes 40 top entrepreneurial
universities as members. It is the
first time it has been held outside
of the East Coast, said Engineering
senior Michelle Cheng, president of
MPowered.
The weekend long event will also
feature two other speakers, Joseph
Williams and Josh Linkner.
Engineering senior Andry Supi-
an, Vice President of MPowered,
said the three speakers each rep-

resent different types of entrepre-
neurship.
Supian described Williams as a
"social entrepreneur." He founded
New Communities Creation Out-
reach, an organization that works
to integrate former prisoners back
into society.
Linker is the founder and CEO of
ePrize, a company that helps other
companies transition from tradi-
tional advertisements to online
marketing.
Supian said that Westergren's
message, and the message of the
entire conference, fits with the
group's mission to expose students
to entrepreneurship and to support
student ventures.

inexpensive textbooks on Amazon.
com to the website, Mahanti said.
Mahantisaidthe website willalso
feature ways for students to contrib-
ute to and find out more about MSA.
There are plans to regularly upload
the budget, meeting minutes, agen-
das and resolutions to the page.
Students will also be able to log
in through their Facebook accounts
to comment on a new MSA blog.
Mahanti said the website changes
would help improve MSA's relation-
ship with students and would make
the assembly more transparent.
"By starting with a new website,
with documents, minutes, proposals,
resolutions, budget stuff, everything
and anything," he said, "having that
there from the get-go is going to real-
ly help us on that path."
In addition to revamping the
website's design, Mahanti and
Rorro also want to use it to pro-
mote and expand resources like
the Blue Hiring Blue program,
which helps students get jobs and
internships. They also plan to hold
a five-day job week, during which
MSA would bring in student orga-
nizations and representatives from
the Career Center and companies
to hold resume workshops, mock
interviews, information sessions
and forums.
The pair also has plans in the
works to help foster stronger rela-
tionships between MSA and stu-
dent organizations by matching up
interested student groups with an
MSA representative. The represen-
tatives would meet with their des-
ignated student organizations on
abi-weeklormonthl hais and

would attend some of their events.
"It's just sort of a way to devel-
op a closer connection to MSA, to
show that we can actually help
(student organizations) out," Rorro
said, "We want to help out student
groups with anything at all, not
just funding."
Additionally, Rorro said he and
Mahanti want to make funding an
easier process in itself by holding
workshops to teach student orga-
nizations how to fill out funding
applications.
Mahanti said that he and Rorro
also want to reach out to the stu-
dent body at large by holding
office hours outside of MSA's loca-
tion in the Michigan Union, like
on the Diag and in Mason Hall.
MSA representatives are already
required to hold one office hour a
week, but Mahanti said students
don't typically take advantage
of them because they aren't well
publicized and aren't held in con-
venient locations.
"Outreach is really hard. People
don't like to look at signs. They
don't like to talk on the Diag, so
it's inherently a difficult problem,"
Mahanti said. "But we've been
doing our best with the campaign
and moving forward to make sure
we're out there as much as possible
without annoying people."
While Mahanti and Rorro said
they plan to tackle larger goals like
tuition and helping students find jobs,
theywanttotakeimmediateactionto
focus on more attainable goals.
"MSA is a series of small victo-
ries, and I think that if we go into
the year looking at it like that, and
if we start having these small vic-
tories, then next year maybe we
can have bigger victories," Mah-
anti said. "But I think right now
we can look at these small things
and deliver on them, and then
hush forward."

College cost group
endorses Obama's
budget proposal

Group says increased
Pell Grant funding
will ease burden on
students' families
By MALLORY JONES
Daily StaffReporter
Representatives from the
Campaign for College Afford-
ability issued a report yesterday
explaining the group's support
for President Barack Obama's
budget proposal, which, if
passed, would increase direct
federal financial aid to stu-
dents.
In a conference call with
reporters yesterday Christine
Lindstrom, director of the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group's
Higher Education Program, and
a member of the Campaign for
College Affordability said the
federal student aid program
requires dramatic reconstruc-
tion.
"This is a stepping stone. The
Obama budget takes into con-
sideration that this is an initial
investment," Lindstrom said.
"More needs tobe done."
Obama's budget proposal calls
for an end to the Federal Family
Education Loan Program, which
provides subsides to banks that
loan to students. Instead, all
federal student loans would be
issued through the Department
of Education's Direct Loan Pro-
gram, according to the report,
Obama's Budget: Supporting
Students, Not Banks.
The Department of Educa-
tion predicts an increase of
$5 billion to the Federal Pell
Grant Program in the 2010-
2011 school year, taken directly
from money previously given to
banks.
In Michigan, 181,767 students
received Pell Grants. Obama's
proposal would provide for
an additional 9,172 recipients

in Michigan and increase the
average total awarded by $114,
according to research by U.S.
PIRG.
In 1977, the Pell Grant covered
77 percent of the total cost of
college for low-income students
according to research by U.S.
PIRG. Today, the grant covers 35
percent of the total costs.
Obama's proposal attempts
to safeguard the program from
falling behind the rising costs of
tuition, Lindstrom said. She said
she thinks the change will allow
the grant to stay useful for years
to come.
"Specifically, the budget actu-
ally proposes indexing (the Pell)
grant to inflation so it increases
by inflation plus one each year
after," Lindstrom said. "That's
currently not how the Pell Grant
works and that will help the Pell
Grant stay viable."
The average tuition for a four-
year public university in Michi-
gan increased by 11 percent
between the 2006-2007 to the
2007-2008 school years.
In the report, Campaign for
College Affordability officials
also expressed their support
for programs to help students
who have graduated repay their
debt.
Robert Brandon, of the
Campaign for College Afford-
ability, said on the conference
call that high debt discourages
college graduates from enter-
ing typically lower-paying, yet
extremely important career
fields like teaching and social
work.
Brandon said increasing pro-
grams to help students who have
graduated repay their debt, like
the Income-Based Repayment
Program, which will allow stu-
dents to pay back only as much
as they can afford according to
their income, will help to open
up opportunities for graduates.
The Department of Education
will implement this program
starting July 1.

Air Force up first for 'M'

CH ANEL VON H ABSBURG-LOT HRINGEN/Da
Early-enrollee Will Campbell was the most highly-touted recruit (a five-star, according to rivals.com) in this year's class.
Campbell settling
in early at Michigan

By ALEX PROSPERI
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan football fans held
their collective breath on Jan.
3 as highly touted recruit Will
Campbell picked which school
he'd attend on national television
during the Army All-American
Bowl. Late in the third quarter,
the Detroit native was ready to
announce his choice.
Sitting before him were three
hats - one from Miami (Fla.), one
from Louisiana State and one from
Michigan. The hat Campbell put
on would be his school of choice.
As Campbell uttered the words
"My school is," he reached for the
LSU hat with his right hand but
snagged the Michigan cap with
his left.
Michigan fans were relieved
that day, but it wasn't the first time
Campbell had them on the edge of
their seats.
At a summer camp before his
junior year at Detroit Cass Tech-
nical High School, Campbell com-
mitted to play at Michigan for
then-coach Lloyd Carr. But last
September, Campbell announced
that he'd decided to reopen his
recruitment.
Six days before the Army All-
American Bowl, Campbell essen-
tially said Michigan was no longer
in the running. The announcement
was devastating to the Wolverines,

who were losing defensive tackles size (6-foot-5, 330 pounds), speed

It's a matchup that predates the
days of college hockey, one that
former Michigan and Air Force
coach Vic Heyliger would be torn
between.

the opposite. blogs.michi-
Both top- gandaily.com
seeded Michigan
(29-11-0) and No. 4 seed Air Force
(27-10-2) play wide-open styles.
Both teams are led by Hobey Baker
candidates - Michigan's Louie
Caporusso and Air Force's Jacques
Lamoureux, who has an NCAA-
leading 32 goals.
The two teams face off in the
NCAA East Regional in Bridge-

port, Conn. today at 3 p.m. Last
year, the Wolverines won the East
Regional, beating Niagara 5-1 in
the first round and Clarkson 2-0 in
the quarterfinals.
"They're an experienced team,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said when asked about Air Force.
"Let's face it, they're excited about
going back and proving some-
thing in this tournament. They've
been there for two years. They're
juniors and seniors, and they want
to do more than just put a scare
into somebody."
The two offenses are compa-
rable - Michigan averages 3.63
goals per game while Air Force
averages slightly more with 3.69
goals per game.
The key for the Wolverines is
shutting down forwards Lam-
oureux, Brent Olson and Greg
Flynn, who power the Falcon
attack.
"We know that (Lamoureux is)
on the team - I'm sure that either
my line or Rust's line will play
against him and try to shut him
down," senior forward Tim Miller
said. "I know they have a big goal-
ie, and we're just going to have to
try and get to him."
Air Force isled in net by Andrew
Volkening, who has a .926 save
percentage.
Although the Wolverines are
playing a mid-afternoon game,
they aren't concerned about the

possible lack of attendance.
"Rightnow, whenyou're playing
college hockey, you need tobe able
to play in front of anyone," senior
forward Travis Turnbull said.
"Some of the best days when you're
a kid, there's no one is in the stands
but your mom and dad. I think if
you're playing college hockey, that
shouldn't be an issue."
To have any shot ofearningatrip
to the Frozen Four in Washington
D.C., Michigan must bounce back
from last weekend's poor perfor-
mance. The Wolverines showed
major kinks in their armor last
weekend against Notre Dame in
the CCHA Tournament title game,
allowing five unanswered goals en
route to a 5-2 loss.
Most of the team saw that col-
lapse against the Fighting Irish as
a wake-up call, but playing argu-
ably the worst period of the season
right before the NCAA Tourna-
ment isn't a good way to start a
playoff run.
But with the excitement of do-
or-die play underway, Berenson
thinks his team will recover.
"I think we'll turn the corner
here in the next few days," Beren-
son said on Monday. "I know that's
how I feel. I'm putting this game
behind us, knowing a little more
about Air Force and now there's
more talk about the tournament.
I think we'll get that excitement
going."

Blue ready to come back toA2

By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
This weekend is big. And not just
for the players.
When asked what she is expect-
ing out of this weekend's home-
opening doubleheader against
Loyola-Chicago, Michigan junior
third baseman Maggie Viefhaus
was resolute.
"A lot of cheering, a lot of loud-
ness," the junior said. "It's so cool
because we actually get to pick our
own walk-up song and hear our
song. Everyone is there for you."
After 29 away games so far this
year, the 12th-ranked Wolverines
(20-9, 0-2 Big Ten) are more than
ready for their home debut against
Loyola tomorrow. Fourteen of their
22remainingregular-seasongames
will be played at home.
Michigan has been touring the
warmer parts of the country -
Florida, California, Georgia and
Nevada - patiently waiting for the
weather back home to improve.
The team was finally able to
move practice outside a week and
a half ago when temperatures
reached the 40s and 50s. While the
cold causes the field to be a little

bouncier than the warmer fields
they are accustomed to, the Wol-
verines are confident in their abil-
ity to adjust.
"We've been playing for a cou-
ple months now and even though
it's home, it's still dirt, still field,
the same game," freshman second
baseman Stephanie Kirkpatrick
said. "So either way, we're going to
play our best."
And Michigan is eager to get on
the field.
"The home opener is like open-
ing day in Major League Baseball,"
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
said. "And you know, we get good
crowds. We are definitely the best
attendance in the Big Ten, so it's an
exciting place to play."
Kirkpatrick, freshman firstbase-
man Amanda Chidester and fresh-
man outfielder Bree Evans will
make their home debuts.
"Not so much nervous, more
anxious," Kirkpatrick mused about
tomorrow's opener. "I'm excited to
play at home ... I think our whole
team is just pumped and ready to
play, especially the other fresh-
man."
It has been an up-and-down
season so far for Loyola (13-9).

The Ramblers lost four-games in a
row, went on to win four straight
and then lost two more until win-
ning Thursday. Now, without clear
momentum in either direction, the
Ramblers could pose a challenge.
"They are bringing a team that
pitches pretty well and looks like
they have some speed," Hutchins
said. "I think it would be a big mis-
take for us to look past them or to
think that we get to winbecause we
have a bigger name on our chest."
Distractions could be another
variable during this weekend's
highly anticipated doubleheader. It
willbe thefirstgame in monthsthat
the team is not constantly together
before the game, on the bus and in
the hotel room.
"Well, I think game-day atmo-
sphere is actuallythe onethingthat
is a little different for our kids,"
Hutchins said. "We don't have as
much control over them. We don't
go to a hotel like football does."
Having won just three of its
last six home openers, Michigan's
history provides no insurance for
what might happen this weekend.
The good news: all three of those
wins were against non-conference
teams.
