University of Michigan students 
gathered at the University Spectrum 
Center Wednesday evening for a 
town hall discussion on creating 
a plan to implement an informed 
consent model for gender-affirming 
care at University Health Services. 
At the event, ten students worked 
to identify and address health care 
disparities for transgender students 

at U-M. 
The students explained that 
at UHS, individuals who wish to 
receive gender-affirming care must 
first obtain a letter of support from 
a licensed mental health provider, 
following the standards of care 
outlined by the World Professional 
Association for Transgender Health. 
In place of receiving a clinical 
diagnosis, 
town 
hall 
attendees 
advocated for UHS to begin using an 
informed consent model. This would 
let individuals receive treatment on 

a consensual basis instead of having 
to receive a diagnosis. 
LSA senior Camomile Honey 
lead the town hall meeting. In 
an interview with The Daily, she 
said the WPATH Standards of 
Care followed by UHS puts up 
unnecessary barriers for students 
wishing to receive hormone therapy.
“When it comes to the WPATH 
Standards of Care, the big word that 
comes out is gatekeeping,” Honey 
said. “It’s fundamentally difficult 
for students, more difficult than an 

informed consent model, but it also 
sends the wrong message in a lot of 
ways.”
According to the UHS website, 
UHS currently follows the WPATH 
Standards of Care to give individuals 
the best care possible. The website 
also points users towards the Corner 
Health Care Center in Ypsilanti 
if they wish to receive gender-
affirming care using the informed 
consent model.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

For Business junior Dajana 
Korcari, Instagram is more 
than just a social outlet. As a 
brand ambassador for several 
companies — including Tinder 
and Ulta Beauty — Instagram 
is also her job. Koracari, an 
influencer, relies on revenue 
from her posts. But potential 
changes to Instagram’s format 
could impact her work on 
campus.
Instagram 
has 
started 
testing a new feature where 
users will no longer be able 
to see the number of likes on 

other users’ photos. Users will 
still be able to see the people 
who liked the post and the 
number of likes on their own 
photos, but no definite number 
will be attached to photos and 
videos posted for others to see. 
While Korcari does not 
think that getting rid of likes 
will stop her from working as 
a brand ambassador, but said it 
would change how companies 
work 
with 
Instagram 
influencers. 
“I think brands are going 
to come up with a different 
way to choose who they work 
with,” Korcari said. “However, 
with the brands I’ve worked 

with so far, most of them have 
been with me posting rather 
than amount of likes I get on a 
picture.”
Instagram had been testing 
the new feature in Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Italy, 
Japan and New Zealand as 
early as April 2019. 
In an email, Seine Kim, 
product communications lead 
at Instagram, said the company 
began a global expansion of the 
test eliminating the option to 
view likes on photos and videos 
on Nov. 14, including in the U.S. 
market.
“While 
the 
feedback 
from early testing has been 

positive, this is a fundamental 
change to Instagram, and so 
we’re continuing our test to 
learn more from our global 
community,” Kim wrote. 
The 
results 
from 
other 
countries who have undergone 
the testing have been positive 
according to Kim, but creators 
are still concerned about how 
the change will impact their 
work through the app. In 
response to concern regarding 
influencers, Instagram has said 
the company is evaluating ways 
to ensure creators are able to 
keep their sponsorships. 

While Juan Muñoz should be 
in the final stretch of completing 
his Bachelor of Science degree 
in Architecture, the would-
be Taubman senior is instead 
launching a GoFundMe to help 
pay the University of Michigan’s 
out-of-state tuition despite being 
a resident of Michigan since age 
four.
Muñoz, who is undocumented, 
is a recipient of Deferred Action 
for 
Childhood 
Arrivals, 
a 
program enacted under former 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 
administration 
protecting 
undocumented child immigrants 
from deportation if they met 
certain requirements. President 
Donald Trump announced plans 
to rescind DACA in September 
2017. 
Muñoz transferred to the 
University as a junior after 
completing his associate’s degree 
in Architecture Technology and 
Industrial Design Technology at 
Henry Ford Community College. 
As the first person in his family to 
attend college, Muñoz completed 
his associate’s degree in a little 
less than five years, paying for 
his tuition out of pocket while 
balancing a job on top of his 
courses.

The University of Michigan 
College 
of 
Engineering 
welcomed Brandi P. Jones, Vice 
Dean for Diversity and Strategic 
Initiatives 
at 
University 
of 
Southern California’s Viterbi 
School of Engineering as a 
part of the Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion lecture series in 
Pierpont Commons Tuesday 
afternoon. 
Jones 
spoke 
to 
Michigan 
faculty 
about 
supporting Black engineering 
students 
at 
the 
University. 
About 50 faculty and students 
attended the event. 
 Jones has over twenty 
years of experience working 
in higher education. Her job 
consists 
of 
overseeing 
the 
graduation and retention rates 
for underrepresented students 
at USC. During her talk, she 
highlighted 
the 
problems 
American institutions often fail 
to address when working with 
Black engineering students. 
“I 
think 
it’s 
critical 
to 
understand specific populations 
particularly when there are 
differences in the way those 
populations are experiencing 
colleges of engineering,” Jones 
said.

Following Sunday’s opening 
of six dispensaries officially 
selling recreational marijuana 
in Michigan, three of which 
are based in Ann Arbor, 
students are considering the 
impact of this new legislation 
in a historically cannabis-
friendly city.
The 
commencement 
of 
recreational 
sale 
comes 
a 
year 
after 
Michigan 
passed Proposal 1, allowing 
adults over the age of 21 to 
possess up to 2.5 ounces 
of 
marijuana. 
Under 
the 
proposal, recreational sales of 
marijuana are subject to a 10 
percent excise tax in addition 
to 
Michigan’s 
six-percent 
sales tax. 
Students like LSA senior 
Luke Gaines feel this new 
supply 
of 
recreational 
marijuana won’t change life 
on campus much since the 

University must still abide 
by federal laws regarding 
the 
possession, 
use 
and 
distribution 
of 
marijuana. 
He likened the restraints on 
its usage to those placed on 
alcohol use on campus. One 
of the greatest positives, he 
believes, is a generally safer 
use of the drug. 
“I think weed is healthier 
than alcohol — period — 
but also, now it’s regulated; 
people aren’t worried about 
it being laced with anything,” 
Gaines said. “I think it will be 
safer overall. I think people 
like to know where they’re 
getting it from and will like 
to know that it’s safe and 
regulated by the government, 
as opposed to needing to buy 
it from whomever.”

CHAPPED LIPS
puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Muñoz has been a Michigan 
resident ever since his family left 
Mexico 20 years ago. 
“I got here when I was four 
years old, I turned five here,” 
Muñoz said. “I stayed in Detroit, 
Michigan. Literally from there 
forward I never left state. I’ve 
been going to Michigan schools 
since then and I’ve been going 
to school continuously. Even 
after graduating (high school), I 
never stopped, but I’m still being 
considered out-of-state.”
When Muñoz was accepted to 
the University, he was ecstatic, 
but it was not until he was already 
enrolled in Taubman College 
of 
Architecture 
and 
Urban 
Planning in fall 2018 he found 
out he did not qualify for in-state 
tuition. At the time Muñoz 
entered the University, residency 
eligibility required students to 
have attended an accredited 
Michigan high school for at least 
three years, attended a Michigan 
middle school for two years and 
to enroll at the University within 
28 months of graduating high 
school. Muñoz satisfied the first 
two requirements, but because 
he enrolled 60 months after 
graduating high school, he was 
told he owed the University out-
of-state tuition for the fall 2018 
semester. 
“I was already in the fall 
program when it turned out that 
there was nothing that could 
be done,” Muñoz said. “Even 
with my appeals … I was already 
enrolled. That meant that I had to 
pay that tuition. We went to try 
and get it resolved with Regents. 
The policy was not resolved in 
the fall. For winter semester, my 
professors allowed me to attend 
the classes, do the work, get an 
informal grade, but I couldn’t 
register, so it’s not formally on my 
transcript.” 
In July, the Board of Regents 
approved a revision extending 
the enrollment time limit from 
28 months to 40 months, but 
the policy revision still does not 
apply to Muñoz. After appealing 

his enrollment status, applying 
for scholarships and revising the 
policy, Muñoz said he exhausted 
all efforts and had to start the 
GoFundMe, his last resort and an 
option he wished he did not have 
to use. 
“I tried everything,” Muñoz 
said. “I tried changing the policy, 
I tried scholarships, I tried 
everything else that I could and 
that didn’t work. This is why 
I’m doing it. It’s not like, ‘Give 
me money.’ That’s not what I’m 
trying to say. I just want to finish 
my education.” 
Muñoz said taking an extended 
amount of time to complete an 
associate’s degree and transfer 
to the University was a common 
situation 
for 
undocumented 
students who often come from 
lower 
income 
backgrounds. 
According to a University Record 
article on the July update, Kedra 
Ishop, vice provost for enrollment 
management, said there was 
sufficient evidence supporting a 
residency time limit extension. 
“It’s not surprising that these 
students often need to take longer 
to finance and achieve their 
eventual successful application 
and enrollment,” Ishop said. 
“We need to make sure that we 
maintain reasonable access for 
those who need to stop along the 
way, for instance to work, but 
who continue to achieve and are 
great candidates for U-M.”
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen wrote in an email 
interview with The Daily that 
residency rules apply to all of 
those who qualify and noted the 
appeals process for students and 
families who wish to have their 
residency decision considered.
“Residency rules apply to all 
students who qualify,” Broekhuizen 
wrote. “Additionally, an appeals 
process exists for students/families 
who wish to have their residency 
decision reconsidered.”
Muñoz said he tried appealing 
the decision, but his case was 
rejected. 
The University is now requiring 
him 
to 
pay 
approximately 
$106,000: the remaining balance 
of his fall 2018 tuition, which is 
$26,700 per semester, and $80,000 

for the three remaining semesters. 
LSA 
senior 
Barbara 
Diaz, 
co-founder and outreach chair 
of 
Student 
Community 
of 
Progressive 
Empowerment, 
a 
student organization supporting 
undocumented 
students 
on 
campus, said many states already 
have 
in-state 
tuition 
policies 
specific to undocumented students. 
These policies often require a 
certain number of years attending 
a middle school and high school in 
the state and ask the student to sign 
an affidavit agreeing to apply for 
citizenship as soon as they are able. 
“Michigan for some reason 
doesn’t have a policy like that,” 
Diaz said. “It’s really up to each 
university to come up with its 
own policy on how they want to 
move students in. U of M is in a 
very complicated situation because 
there is such a large difference 
between in-state and out-of-state 
students. In terms of coming up 
with a way to amend the policy, it 
was trying to find a way to increase 
access, but not too much where 
people who aren’t from the state 
are able to apply or get in-state 
tuition.” 
Diaz is also a DACA recipient 
and noted the importance of 
showing 
prospective 
students 
who are undocumented they can 
apply to and attend the University. 
She emphasized the significance 
of building community in a time 
where the continuation of DACA is 
uncertain at the federal level. 
“You always hear about students 
thinking that they can’t go to college 
because they’re undocumented,” 
Diaz said. “Something with SCOPE 
is how do we reach out more to 
people? How can we mentor other 
students? How can we form those 
connections? Sometimes it feels like 
our goal is just to survive … especially 
right now with DACA going back 
to the Supreme Court … We’re 
worried about what happens if we 
lose status in a couple months.” 
While 
acknowledging 
the 
potential benefits from Muñoz’s 
GoFundMe would outweigh the 
risks, Diaz noted the mental and 
emotional burden of being an 
undocumented student.
“Just by being undocumented, 
and you being in this country, 
that inherently makes you not 
entitled to anything,” Diaz 
said. “You spend your whole 
existence trying to prove other 
people wrong about that.”
Muñoz and Diaz said the 
current hold on DACA puts 
immense pressure on DACA 
recipients, many of whom feel 
left in the dark about their 
immigration status. The DACA 
application halt has not stopped 
all 
undocumented 
students 
from enrolling at the University, 
but they are now enrolling as 
undocumented and not DACA-
documented.
“Currently, 
the 
program 
is 
still 
there,” 
Diaz 
said. 
“Hopefully it stays safe and 
expands 
and 
allows 
more 
people to apply.” 
The U.S. Supreme Court 
is currently considering if 
President Trump can continue 
with a shutdown of DACA for 
nearly 700,000 undocumented 
immigrants, and the decision 
would determine if DACA 
has an immediate end as 
opposed to a gradual wind-
down. However, a decision 
is not expected until 2020, 

and if a Democrat wins the 2020 
presidential race, Trump may lose 
his chance to end the program 
altogether. 
Muñoz echoed Diaz’ sentiments, 
noting in his senior year of high 
school he was unaware he could 
attend 
the 
University 
as 
an 
undocumented student. Fear of 
revealing his immigration status to 
the University restrained him from 
asking for help, he said. 
“My dream in high school was to 
get here as a freshman, but I didn’t 
even think that an undocumented 
person could come here,” Muñoz 
said. “Disclosing status is very 
scary, so I didn’t try and ask anyone 
here. It’s a big institution, it’s also a 
public institution which has ties to 
the government, so I wasn’t going to 
disclose. If I could have come here 
as a freshman I would have done 
so. I couldn’t, also, financially so I 
decided to go through community 
college.” 
Muñoz 
said 
starting 
his 
GoFundMe 
was 
terrifying 
because he had to disclose his 
undocumented status — possibly 
endangering his family by openly 
sharing his status with strangers on 
the Internet. 
“I was terrified, I had fear of 
backlash, I had fear of failure,” 
Muñoz said. “Now that my status 
is disclosed, at first it was okay, but 
after a day, I got a hateful message. 
And then more and more started 
just showing up … I see that it’s 
getting shared more and more and 
that means more people are going 
to know my status. I knew this came 
with it, I knew it was a risk, but this 
was my last resort … I don’t want to 
give up on being an architect.”
In October 2017, the U-M Student 
Community 
for 
Progressive 
Empowerment 
held 
a 
rally 
with four key requests: clearer 
resources 
for 
undocumented 
prospective 
students, 
an 
extension of the requirements to 
qualify for in-state tuition, a point 
person within administration for 
undocumented students and fully 
met financial aid for those who 
qualify. 
Broekhuizen 
cited 
the 
University’s 
resources 
for 
DACA 
recipients 
and 
other 
undocumented 
student 
as 
continued engagement with 
the undocumented community 
and organizations like SCOPE. 
 
“The University maintains 
a dedicated site specifically 
designed to address the needs 
of our undocumented student 
community,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“Furthermore, 
the 
University 
has 
actively 
engaged 
with 
the 
DACA/
undocumented 
community 
through 
the 
Office 
of 
Enrollment 
Management; 
Office of Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion; Student Life; 
the International Center; CEW+; 
Office of Government Relations, 
and others to identify resources 
and to make transparent how 
DACA/Undocumented 
students 
can navigate these issues.” 
Additional 
resources 
Broekhuizen highlighted included 
undocumented-specific sites for 
admissions, financial aid and 
Rackham, as well as the Spanish-
language sites for admissions and 
financial aid.

Professors, students reflect on 
online voting registration system

Electronic option will save costs on paper and mailing, increase accuracy of voter profiles

MADELINE MCLAUGHLIN 
Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan’s 
Secretary 
of State Jocelyn Benson 
announced Monday that 
Michigan residents can 
now 
register 
to 
vote 
and update their voter 
registration 
status 
online. In a statement, 
Benson 
announced 
the online option was 
implemented primarily as 
a means of enabling more 
streamlined, convenient 
means of registration for 
citizens.
“This fast, convenient, 
cost-effective and secure 
option to register to vote 
will enable many more 
people 
to 
participate 
in 
democracy 
and 
help 
Michigan’s 
clerks 
maintain 
complete, 
accurate and up-to-date 
voter rolls,” Benson said.
In 
the 
statement, 
Benson’s office outlined 
a number of benefits to 
implementing 
online 
voter 
registration, 
namely 
cutting 
costs 
on

and mailing, increasing 
accuracy 
for 
applicant 
files, 
facilitating 
more 
frequent voter updates 
and allowing for ease and 
convenience 
for 
voters 
trying to register. 
Michigan is now one 
of 38 states to allow 
electronic 
registration. 
Legislation to implement 
online voter registration 
was passed by the state 
legislature 
in 
2018. 
After 
identifying 
their 
residency from a driver’s 
license or state ID, users 
can register or update 

their registration through 
an 
online 
tool. 
Those 
without a driver’s license 
or state ID are able to use 
the streamlined website 
to learn more about the 
means by which they can 
register. 
LSA 
junior 
Carolyn 
Chen, director of voter 
registration for College 
Democrats, 
reflected 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
enacting 
legislation 
that eases the burden 
often 
associated 
with 
registering to vote.
“Voting 
registration 
laws are the number one 
reason 
why 
American 
voter turnout is low,” 
Chen said. “In a cost 
benefit 
analysis, 
the 
benefits 
of 
voting—
having 
your 
one 
vote 
sway the entire election. 
(These 
benefits) 
are 
way less than the costs 
of having to register—
taking the initiative to 
print 
out 
registration 
forms and mailing them 
into 
the 
city 
clerk. 
Anything that will help 
make voter registration 
easier will be a great step 
for democracy.” 
Chen 
went 
on 
to 
discuss 
how 
Michigan 
legislators 
should 
be 
cautious in the program’s 
implementation, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
may 
hinder 
some 
citizens 
from registering. 
“There are still some 
issues that need to be 
solved since the online 
registration is so new,” 
Chen said. “Some states 
are including new ID laws 
with online registration 
which will just suppress 

more 
voters 
as 
well 
as 
some 
issues 
with 
mistakes in the system 
purging some voters, but 
nothing is perfect and 
this will be a great step 
forward.”
The 
voting 
announcement 
came 
after 
Michigan 
began 
automatic 
voter 
registration 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
distribution of driver’s 
license and state ID cards 
in 
September. 
Despite 
these 
recent 
changes, 
longstanding 
methods 
of 
voter 
registration, 
like registration by mail, 
will remain options for 
citizens. 
Benson’s 
public 
statement 
claimed 
that young voters were 
particularly likely to take 
advantage of the online 
voter registration system. 
In 2017, the University of 
Michigan launched the 
Big Ten Voting Challenge, 
a nonpartisan effort to 
incite civic engagement 
among younger citizens 
and students across Big 
Ten 
universities. 
Edie 
Goldenberg, U-M political 
science and public policy 
professor, 
spearheaded 
the 
movement 
at 
the 
University. 
In 
an 
interview with The Daily, 
Goldenberg 
noted 
that 
while she was happy with 
the 
implementation 
of 
online registration, she 
wanted 
individuals 
to 
remember the program 
was 
only 
for 
in-state 
students.
“I 
am 
delighted 
that 
this 
is 
going 
to 
be 
implemented,” 

Goldenberg 
said. 
“It’s 
going 
to 
make 
things 
much easier, especially 
for 
students. 
But 
it’s 
important to remember 
that it’s only available for 
students who have either 
a 
Michigan 
driver’s 
license or a Michigan 
state ID.” 
While 
this 
program 
could 
open 
doors 
for 
Michigan 
residents, 
it 
does not apply to out-of-
state students, who make 
up a large portion of the 
student body, Goldenberg 
said. 
“We 
have 
students 
from outside the state 
of Michigan who might 
want to vote in Michigan, 
they have the right to do 
that — any college student 
may choose to vote either 
at home or where they’re 
studying,” 
Goldenberg 
said. 
“So 
for 
those 
students, they can’t use 
electronic registration.” 
She 
concluded 
by 
reflecting 
on 
the 
importance of legislation 
that 
allows 
for 
more 
streamlined 
voting 
registration, as it enables 
citizens to exercise one of 
their most fundamental 
rights.
“I think that voting 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
fundamental 
rights 
that 
citizens 
have,” 
Goldenberg said. “And I 
think that young people 
haven’t 
participated 
as much as I wish they 
would, 
and 
therefore 
… 
their 
priorities 
and 
interests are not being 
heard as much as older 
people’s 
priorities 
and 
interests are.”

was the first to apply for a 
recreational marijuana license 
upon its availability on Nov. 1. 

The operational marijuana 
facility 
prepared 
before 
Proposal 
1 
was 
passed, 
anticipating 
the 
eventual 
outcome. 
Narmin 
Jarrous, 
executive 
vice 
president 
of 
business 
development, 
explained 
Exclusive 
Brands 
used the general template for 
approval of a medical facility to 
apply for recreational sale. 
“We 
knew 
recreational 
marijuana 
would 
eventually 
be approved, so we always 
had that kind of in our sights,” 
Jarrous said. 
“Once 
it 
got 
approved, 
we went into overdrive. We 
used 
the 
medical 
facility 
application as a guide and 
kind of guessed our way 
through to figure out what 
we’d 
anticipate 
on 
the 
application. It was really a 
year-long process.” 
The 
process 
involved 
working with city officials, 
local businesses and the Ann 
Arbor community. According 
to 
Jarrous, 
all 
players 
have 
been 
very 
receptive 
to working with Exclusive 

Brands and other businesses. 
“The 
city 
made 
sure 
everything was in regulation, 
and we worked closely with 
them to understand the city’s 
rules and city’s regulations 
and their concerns,” Jarrous 
said. “And then we tied that 
into our application, and we 
made sure that everything 
from our building, to the 
traffic flow, to our hours of 
operation, were in regulation 
with the city and convenient 
for the businesses around 
us. We only want to have 
a positive impact on this 
community, and I think we’re 
doing a pretty good job at it, 
and we’re hoping that it only 
grows.”
LJ Horowitz, Kinesiology 
senior, 
is 
 
president 
of 
Green Wolverine, a student 
organization that educates 
students on the medicinal 
advantages 
of 
cannabis, 
discussed 
the 
growth 
of 
the cannabis industry and 
current 
policies 
revolving 
cannabis. While he believes 
Ann Arbor is one of the 
best places in the world to 
use cannabis, he expressed 
concern with the rollout of 
recreational 
marijuana 
in 
regards to possible shortages. 
This, he said, was one of 
the topics of the Michigan 
Cannabis Leaders Summit, 

which took place last week.
“We already had a weak 
harvest in Michigan, and 
then with the adult use, that 
is surely going to run out 
very quickly,” Horowitz said. 
“Just because there’s no limit 
on how much you can really 
purchase, and there’s only 
really three stores in the Ann 
Arbor area. It’s going to be a 
real supply issue pretty soon, 
and you’re going to see the 
prices sky-rocket probably 
after the new year. In which 
case 
they 
probably 
won’t 
come down again until the 
summer. At least that’s the 
prediction.”
He 
emphasized 
while 
recreational purchase is a 
step in the right direction, 
there will need to be a 
consistent effort to ensure 
a stable supply for medical 
patients. He also emphasized 
the importance of setting 
a good example model for 
other states on the path 
to 
legalizing 
recreational 
marijuana. 
“With 
regards 
to 
recreation, I don’t want it to 
seem like I have a negative 
viewpoint on it because of 
this price raise, I think it’s 
great; it’s going to be really 
great for the city and state,” 
Horowitz said. “It’s more 
so that they really need to 

figure out the supply chain 
and make sure that that’s 100 
percent safe and equitable 
for the medical community 
as well as equitable for the 
recreational 
community. 
Just 
because 
right 
now 
it’s being rolled out really 
inefficiently.” 
Jarrous 
said 
Exclusive 
Brands is receptive to these 
concerns and will always 
prioritize its medical patients 
first. 
“Our number one priority, 
we’ve said this time and time 
again, is always going to be 
to 
our 
patients,” 
Jarrous 
said. “Above the recreational 
entry, above the recreational 
users, 
who 
we 
love 
and 
appreciate, we’re dedicated 
to the patients who use this 
as medicine and need this to 
live comfortable lives.”
Students such as Public 
Health senior Sydni Warner 
have 
mixed 
feelings 
on 
recreational 
sales. 
While 
dispensaries 
will 
produce 
a higher quality product, 
Warner 
wonders 
if 
this 
increased access could extend 
possible underage purchase 
of marijuana with fake IDs. 
She 
also 
emphasized 
the 
need 
for 
currently 
incarcerated 
individuals 
under 
marijuana 
charges 
to be considered for early 

release, 
especially 
where 
Black people are much more 
likely to be arrested. 
“Often those in jail for 
these 
charges 
are 
Black 
men, an already historically 
marginalized 
community 
when it comes to drugs and 
crime,” Warner said. “While 
I 
recognize 
that 
at 
the 
time of conviction they had 
committed a crime, I believe 
that the time they have faced 
up until now should be ample 
time to serve for a crime that 
is no longer illegal.”
Warner, 
an 
Ypsilanti 
resident, 
believes 
that 
legalization 
could 
widen 
racial socio-economic gaps 
between Ypsilanti and Ann 
Arbor, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
Michigan areas. 
“Gentrified areas such as 
particular regions in Detroit 
are projected to have a large 
number of dispensaries in 
the next coming year, most of 
which is owned by whites,” 
Warner said. “This to me 
shows 
that 
white 
owners 
are taking advantage of a 
system that was previously, 
and still in most places, 
used 
to 
reprimand 
and 
discriminate 
against 
poor, 
low 
socioeconomic 
status 
Black men. I just simply 
think it’s unfair to have large 
percentages of young Black

Jones drew on data from the 
2017 University of Michigan 
Campus 
Climate 
Study. 
According to the study, Black 
engineers 
have 
different 
experiences compared to other 
engineering students. 
“In the area of feeling that they 
are treated fairly and equitably 
by others, Black students report 
much lower than the overall 
population,” Jones said. “When 
asked if they feel that they belong 
at University of Michigan the 
majority of students said ‘yes.’ In 
this case the outliers were Black 
students.”
Rackham 
student 
Jocelyn 
Jackson, a first-year Ph.D. student 
in 
Engineering 
Education 
Research and the national chair 
for the National Society of Black 
Engineers, 
attended 
Jones’s 
talk. She reflected on how she 
hopes faculty will take initiative 
to bring about change in the 
engineering community. 
“I think that the people who 
are really curious to learn and 
everyone that did come to the 
seminar I hope that they are able 
to hear diverse perspectives, but 
then think about what they’re 
going to do and how they’re going 
to be a change agent,” Jones said.
Jones said students would 
most 
likely 
be 
engaged 
in 
engineering and STEM fields 
if they had the support of their 
community. She recalled that 
students she spoke to often felt 
isolated by peers in large lecture 
halls and revealed anonymous 
quotes from students at the 
school of engineering. 
“‘No one wants to partner 
with me in class. I’m always 
the last choice because I’m 
Black,’” Jones recalled the 
student telling her.
Jones then went on to 
explain how professors and 
advisors at the University of 
Michigan can communicate 
with Black engineers in order 
to provide a more supportive 
and welcoming community. 
“When 
you 
see 
them 
isolated 
if 
there’s 
group 
work then perhaps this is 
where you make the groups, 
perhaps you go in and you say 
‘I know this is going to be an 
issue, so I’m going to create a 
situation where we’ve got to 
be inclusive,’” Jones said. 
Rackham student Corin 
Bowen attended the talk and 
expressed how she hopes the 
face of engineering at U-M 
and in America will change. 
“The demographics that 
currently exist in the College 
of Engineering does not 
represent this local area, 
they don’t represent the 
state, they don’t represent 
the country, and they don’t 
represent the world. We have 
to move in that direction 
and we need the kind of 
structural changes that we 
started touching on today 
in order to do that,” Bowen 
said.

As the implementation of the 
feature expands, some users are 
finding ways to get around it to 
show off their likes. 
LSA freshman Lucas Felpi 
is 
an 
international 
student 
from São Paulo, Brazil. Felpi’s 
Instagram account is verified as 
a result of internet fame from 
being of the few students to 
receive a perfect score on the 
National High School Exam in 
Brazil. Instagram had started 
testing the new feature in Brazil 
months before Felpi left for 
Michigan. Even after coming to 
the United States, the version of 
the app on his phone still does 
not show likes on his posts.
Felpi said being unable to see 
likes did not affect how often 
people used Instagram in Brazil 
and predicted that it will have 
a bigger effect in the United 
States.
“From my knowledge, I don’t 
think it changed,” Felpi said. “I 
don’t think anyone uninstalled 
Instagram because of it. I don’t 
think usage stopped. I think 
it has the same importance as 
it had before, but it was like 
an enforcement that they’re 
not gonna have likes anymore 
and 
people 
complained 
for 
like a week or a few days and 
then it was over. Everyone just 
continued using it. I think this 
is going to be bigger here. I 
don’t think the use is changing 
because Instagram has a strong, 
solid user base and people are 
not letting go now.”
As an alternative, Felpi said 
users were posting the number 
of likes a post got on their 
Instagram stories, since they 
were able to see the number of 
likes on their own posts. 
However, some influencers 
think 
the 
change 
will 
significantly 
impact 
users. 
Business 
sophomore 
Alyson 
Koh, who runs the food account 
@AllySnacks, believes this new 
feature will be detrimental to 
Instagram’s business model.
“To be honest, I think it’s 
detrimental 
to 
Instagram’s 
business model because if people 
don’t 
have 
that 
measurable 
statistic, 
what 
is 
Instagram 
going to do next?” Koh said. “I 
actually appreciate their move 
toward wellness and mental 
health 
with 
their 
platform 
because it makes people more 
self-conscious when it should 
just be about the picture and the 
gallery of photos you are posting 
and not how many people are 
viewing it. But I think people 
think will jump to another 
platform instead if they don’t 
have the concrete measurement 
of statistics. I think it will affect 
it in a sense that people will 
not use Instagram as often, 
but I think that the people who 
stay will still be there for the 
content.”
Korcari agreed. She thinks a new 
app will come up in response to 
Instagram getting rid of likes. 
“This might cause for another 
app to come out to try to do what 
Instagram was doing. If another 
app does come out, then I believe 
people will jump on that like how 
people left Facebook or Twitter to 
jump on Instagram,” Korcari said. 
“However, I’m interested to see if 
taking away the likes is going to 
increase the use of Instagram or 
decrease it. I feel like it could go 
either way.”
Kim said the testing is still going 
on and that there is no set date for 
this new feature to be released.
“We are testing and have yet 
to come to a final decision about 
private like counts,” Kim wrote.
Businesses 
themselves 
have 
also used Instagram to promote 
their products through exposure 
through social media influencers 
and advertisements. Bivouac is 
one of those companies which 
emphasizes social media in their 
marketing. 
While 
Instagram’s 
new feature may not affect how 
Bivouac markets its products, 
there are concerned about the 
use of other businesses marketing 
with Instagram.
Coco 
Herreria, 
a 
social 
media 
manager 
at 
Bivouac, 
said she thinks Instagram has 
been moving towards forcing 
businesses to purchase ads since 
they 
first 
launched. 
Herreria 
noted Instagram has changed the 
algorithm to control what photos 
are being viewed by users.

“We acknowledge and affirm 
that you are the expert on your own 
body, identity, and experience,” the 
website reads. “As the initiation of 
hormone therapy is a new service 
at UHS, for now, we are following 
the WPATH Standards of Care to 
ensure that you receive the high-
quality care you deserve.” 
In an interview with The Daily 
after the event, Engineering senior 
Violet 
Boyse-Peacor 
said 
she 
was concerned when she found 
out UHS still uses the WPATH 
Standards of Care, as she feels it is 
an older practice. 
“It’s easy, but it’s also a pain to 
get informed consent because you 
have to get to Ypsilanti (to Corner 
Health 
Care 
Center),” 
Boyse-
Peacor said. “When I learned that 

you had to use WPATH (at UHS), I 
was slightly surprised.” 
Boyse-Peacor 
said 
she 
has 
previously traveled to Corner 
Health Care Center to receive 
gender-affirming 
care 
under 
the 
informed 
consent 
model. 
Engineering junior Caitlin Beach 
told The Daily telling students to 
travel to Ypsilanti for hormone 
therapy has caused the Corner 
Health Care Center’s waitlist to 
become months long, preventing 
them from quickly receiving the 
care they desire. 
“(The 
WPATH 
model) 
doesn’t give respect to the people 
looking for the service,” Beach 
said. “It gives respect to people 
who are practitioners, who are 
psychiatrists, not the patient.”
Beach said sending students 
elsewhere for care using the 
informed consent model could 
potentially cause students to lose 

trust in other UHS services.
“When you’re going that far to 
avoid that process, you’re not going 
to be as confident when you go for a 
surgery (at the University) and you 
need three letters (of consent) to do 
that,” Beach said. “Right now, it’s 
inefficient and overall increases the 
number of hours put into a patient 
when it shouldn’t need to be that 
way.” 
At the town hall, attendees 
discussed their own experiences 
when 
attempting 
to 
receive 
gender 
reaffirming 
care 
at 
UHS. 
Individuals 
voiced 
concerns regarding the current 
WPATH model, saying it puts 
up 
unnecessary 
barriers 
for 
those wishing to receive gender-
affirming care.
To address this issue, the 
attendees plan to reach out to 
the Trans Care Team and set up 
a meeting early next semester 

to discuss the possible steps to 
achieving the informed consent 
model. By talking to the team 
along with other professionals at 
UHS, the group said they hope 
to continue the conversation of 
informed consent, discuss ways 
the team is helping them as well as 
ways they would be able to improve 
their care.
Honey said she has received 
care from the Trans Care Team at 
the University and had a positive 
experience. She hopes the group 
can help them better serve the 
LGBTQ+ community on campus.
“I found that the doctors were 
really supportive,” Honey said. 
“They are open to talking to 
students, I felt heard … In a lot of 
ways, this whole meeting is about 
helping them out as well.”

The im-Pact of the nuptial narrative

RILEY DEHR | COLUMN

No water, no air, no rights

A need for nostalgia

L

ike 
many 
students 
across 
the 
University 
of Michigan’s campus, 
on Monday, Nov. 11, I spent 
the evening distracted from 
my work in anticipation for a 
special inbox notification. It 
wasn’t related to an internship 
update, a grad school application 
or 
even 
a 
dreaded 
Canvas 
posting. On Monday night, I 
waited with bated breath for 
the results of an online dating 
survey — the Michigan Marriage 
Pact. Created by U-M students 
for U-M students, the survey 
originated as a project for a 
psychology class and quickly 
became so much more. Word of 
this matchmaking service spread 
across campus, and within a few 
weeks, it seemed like everyone 
had taken part — even those of 
us already in relationships. Soon 
after the results were sent out on 
Monday night, the U-M Facebook 
meme page was flooded with 
Pact-related content, including 
lamentations over large age 
differences, mismatched gender 
preferences and the algorithms’ 
failure to pair them with anyone 
at all. Unfortunately, after all 
the anticipation of the evening, 
I found myself among the 
unmatched. Despite my previous 
successes in online dating, the 
Marriage Pact left me loveless 
— well, within the boundaries of 
campus, at least.
My relationship journey with 
the Michigan Marriage Pact 
ended that Monday night. But 
for the survey takers who were 
properly paired up, the question 
changed from ‘So, who?’ to 
‘Well, what next?’ The project’s 
title implies a motive of tying the 
knot. Of course, this response 
would be a bit extreme — even the 
survey’s creators acknowledge 
this, 
disclaiming 
on 
their 
website that while ‘Marriage’ is 
in the name, they “never said it 
applied to your match.” And, yes, 
it does seem excessive to jump 
from an email notification to a 
nuptial celebration. But if a Pact 
match does happen to create a 
spark, shouldn’t the ultimate 
goal be to fan it into a lifelong 
flame and validate it with a 
legal ceremony? Whether one 
dates via swipe, soirée or online 
survey, there is an ever-present 
push towards the finish line 
of a marriage certificate. Any 
relationship that doesn’t achieve 
this end is regarded as not 
having worked out — as a failure. 
And every connection is, at some 
point, evaluated on its ability to 
be ‘the one’ leading to marriage. 
In the United States, the popular 

narrative of love is one of dating 
to marry. The domination of 
this single story normalizes 
an 
expected 
progression 
of 
relationships, leaving out the 
many alternative, equally valid 
pathways for lifelong love. The 
popularity 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Marriage 
Pact 
presents 
the 
perfect opportunity for us to 
reexamine and challenge the 
expectation of marriage and 
to promote the diversity of 
relationships and the expression 
of love in whatever form it may 
take. 
There is no questioning the 
prevalence of marriage in the 
United States. While it certainly 
has decreased since the mid-
20th century, the percentage 
of adults who are married has 
stayed about 50 percent for the 
past decade. According to a 2013 
Pew Research Center survey, 
love and lifelong commitment 
are cited as the two most 
important reasons for tying 
the knot. This sentiment may 
seem beautiful at first glance, 
but a deeper look at these high 
proportions naturally leads to 
the question of why so many 
people feel that marriage is such 
a crucial validation of love and 
commitment. There is nothing 
inherent about the relationship 
between love and marriage, 
yet through the domination of 
legal regulation in the realm 
of love, they have become 
inextricably intertwined. The 
same 2013 survey also pointed 
out the reality of the financial 
and legal benefits of marriage, 
which approximately a quarter 
of respondents claimed were 
important 
motivators 
for 
getting married. It’s difficult to 
deny these motivations when 
public and private institutions 
offer 
numerous 
advantages 
which can only be achieved 
through 
marriage, 
including 
tax deductions, Social Security 
benefits and health insurance 
savings. 
These 
benefits 
not 
only incentivize marriage, but 
also further normalize it as the 
ultimate form of a relationship 
when the same perks are not 
extended to other long-term 
commitments that don’t, or 
can’t, involve marriage.
Though 
the 
necessity 
of nuptials has remained a 
dominating idea in the U.S., the 
beginnings of a challenge to this 
norm are already underway, and 
millennials are the ones starting 
it. That’s right — the nation’s most 
vilified generation is back to kill 
yet another industry. And this 
time, they’re after the marriage 

complex. Millennials are the 
first age cohort to drop below a 
50 percent marriage rate for 25 
to 37-year-olds. The progression 
of love, then marriage, then baby 
carriage is also beginning to 
break down — the proportion 
of 
unmarried 
parents 
who 
cohabit nearly doubled from 
1997 to 2017, and a recent study 
revealed 55 percent of millennial 
births are occurring before 
marriage. It’s nearly impossible 
to investigate this trend without 
running into discussions of 
its 
negative 
consequences, 
such as financial hardship, on 
parents and children. But what 
these fearful arguments fail to 
recognize is that marital status 
itself does not produce these 
negative consequences — it is 
the social institutions that prefer 
married parents to unmarried 
ones. As late Gen Y and early 
Gen Z babies move into phases of 
serious dating and relationships, 
it’s 
important 
to 
continue 
challenging and restructuring 
the oppressive social structures 
that uphold marriage as the most 
valid expression of love.
The institutional regulation 
of relationships and repression 
of love has been slowly but 
surely decreasing in the past 
few decades. In June 1967, 
the Supreme Court decided 
unanimously 
in 
Loving 
v. 
Virginia that laws prohibiting 
interracial 
marriage 
are 
unconstitutional. In June 2015, 
the court made a much closer 5-4 
decision in Obergefell v. Hodges 
declaring the right to same-sex 
marriage to be guaranteed by the 
Fourteenth Amendment. These 
decisions were, without a doubt, 
crucial steps in terms of both 
civil rights and the liberation 
of love. But if we hope to move 
further in these fights, we must 
move beyond legalization and 
begin to question the need for 
a legal regulation of love in the 
first place. Instead of pacts, 
certificates and ceremonies, let’s 
focus on partnership, consent 
and communication. Let’s make 
freedom of love accessible to all 
by freeing love from regulation. 
To those of you who caught a 
match through the Marriage 
Pact, 
consider 
what 
you’re 
ultimately looking for in this 
and any dating venture. And 
for those of you who didn’t, just 
remember there are plenty of 
flexible fish in the sea. Of course, 
you may not even want to go 
fishing — and that’s fine, too.

T

here 
is 
something 
comforting and cozy 
about watching a show 
or movie from your childhood. 
A 
familiarity 
envelops 
the 
experience. You may remember 
every line, the introductory 
song or one episode that you 
really loved from a decade 
previous.
Nostalgia is a beautiful thing 
at times.
It is not a new concept for 
me, but nostalgia is something I 
did not really appreciate until I 
gradually made my way through 
high school and college. When 
we are all home on break, my 
friends and I regale each other 
with times from elementary 
school, middle school and all 
the in-between. There is a 
sense of comfort in the shared 
experience that, despite the 
seeming insignificance at the 
time, holds weight as memory 
in the present.
I remember as a kid, my 
parents always played their 
classic rock CDs throughout 
the house, and as an elementary 
schooler, I did not understand 
the appeal of “old music.” As a 
lover of classic rock now, this 
lack of understanding feels 
out of place upon reflection, 
but in the moment, I was 
genuinely confused as to why 
they wouldn’t play the music 
popular on the radio and 
instead opted for their CDs. The 
ability to connect a memory or 
feeling associated with a period 
of time in one’s life is truly 
remarkable. Little did I know it 
then, but there was an element 
of nostalgia when my parents 
put The Beatles or Pink Floyd 
or U2 on. Television shows, 
movies, songs, pictures 
— they 

can hold tangible memories 
encapsulated within them, like 
accessible personal supercuts 
made from some point in our 
lives.
This sense of nostalgia is 
prominent 
within 
today’s 
popular culture. Whether it 
be the inception of Disney+ 
or the fact that “Victorious”, 
a popular Nickelodeon show 
from the 2000s, was just put 
on Netflix, there is accessibility 
and focus among many high 
school and college students 
to re-watch things from our 
childhood. In the grand scheme 
of things, shows and movies 
from a decade ago may not be 
considered “nostalgic,” given 
that not much time has passed, 
but there is a sense of comfort in 
familiarity.
As college students, we are 
always 
undergoing 
change. 
There is always something 
happening, 
something 
being shifted out of its place 
of normalcy to a place of 
obscurity,. I think the onslaught 
and accessibility of shows and 
movies from our childhoods 
reflects something similar to 
what my parents sought in 
their classic rock CDs — a sense 
of familiarity amongst a vast 
newness. Recognizing a line 
from a show or a movie or being 
able to sing along to the opening 
theme gives us comfort in 
knowing exactly what is coming 
next.
Personally, 
I 
find 
the 
excitement 
and 
chatter 
regarding 
the 
new 
Disney 
platform simply a manifestation 
of something that has always 
been there, and now, college 
students are finding it. Nostalgia 
is something that we all search 

for in some capacity. For some, 
it may be the Disney movies of 
their childhoods, for others it 
is music. Feeling nostalgic can 
be brought upon by something 
as simple as a three-minute 
song or a 21-minute episode of a 
television show.
It is both good and bad to look 
back on things. Heavy reliance 
on looking back or attempting 
to relive parts of the past is not a 
healthy practice. Overindulging 
or fixating on things that have 
happened inhibit an individual’s 
ability to continue on in the 
present. There is a level of 
nostalgic indulgence that is 
appropriate but surpassing such 
fails to allow people to live in 
the moment.
Not all songs bring good 
memories, and not all television 
show episodes remind me of 
happy times, but that is the 
humanity of nostalgia. Not 
all moments are inherently 
joyful or upsetting, but that is 
what makes each individual 
who they are: The past shapes 
the present which builds the 
future. With that I think there 
is a human aspect surrounding 
the 
excitement 
of 
Disney’s 
new 
streaming 
service 
or 
Netflix’s 
newest 
additions. 
There is comfort as we move 
into adulthood, with so many 
question 
marks 
regarding 
differing parts of our lives, in 
reliving the familiar. As my 
parents did with their music, 
and I do with mine, we use 
nostalgia as a necessary means 
of comfort and warmth when 
so many things are changing 
around us.

s I explored campus 
those first few daunting 
and lonely weeks of 
college, I discovered the Nichols 
Arboretum. A patch of historic 
forests and prairies sitting in the 
center of Ann Arbor, it’s arguably 
the most beautiful part of the city 
and a rare peek at what the area 
may have looked like 300 years 
ago. I’ve spent many of my days 
watching the wildlife scamper 
through the grass and fly about 
the trees and underbrush as I do 
my homework.
While each part of the Arb 
is beautiful, the stretch of the 
Huron River that gently runs 
along its northern border and 
throughout the rest of Ann Arbor 
is particularly spectacular. I 
have countless fond memories 
of dipping my toes into the cold 
water or watching the stars with 
friends to the sound of its gentle 
babbling. What I didn’t know 
about this beautiful river is that 
it hides a toxic secret. 
From 
the 
‘60s 
through 
the ‘80s, 850,000 pounds of 
the 
chemical 
dioxane 
was 
improperly dumped by Gelman 
Sciences on their property in 
the outskirts of town. Long-
term exposure to dioxane can 
lead to liver and kidney damage 
and can cause cancer. This toxic 
pool, now known as “the plume,” 
threatens Ann Arbor’s access to 
clean drinking water. 
Floating under Ann Arbor in 
its groundwater, the plume has 
pushed the city to shut down 
more than 100 private drinking 
wells. The city has also become 
increasingly worried that the 
plume will reach Barton Pond, 
where the city gets its water and 
where trace amounts of dioxane 
were detected earlier this year. 
There are currently “virtually 
undetectable levels” of dioxane 
in Ann Arbor’s drinking water 
(which is why I now steal water 
from my roommate’s Brita). The 
problem will be one the city 
grapples with for decades. 
Gelman, now Pall-Gelman, 
is undertaking a process to 
minimize the spread of the 
pollution, with their level of 
effectiveness being described 
as “the least amount possible” 
by former Ann Arbor City 
Councilmember 
Chuck 
Warpehoski, D-Ward 5. The 
city has filed for the plume to be 
designated as a Superfund site in 
order to acquire more funds for 
the cleanup, a lengthy process to 
say the least.
When I learned of this vagrant 
threat to the Huron, I was 
shocked by not only how little 
was being done to stop it but also 
by how little punishment had 
been doled out to the polluter. 
It was unfair for the city having 
to beg for a company’s illegally 
disposed mess to be cleaned up. 
What seemed fair to me was to 
make Pall-Gelman pay to restore 
the groundwater to the way it 
was before they ruined it for 
everybody. We teach children 
to clean up after themselves, so 
why aren’t corporations held to 
the same standard? 
While Ann Arbor is forced to 

struggle with the pollution of 
its water, natives of Southwest 
Detroit’s 
Mexicantown 
can’t 
escape the reeking air pollution 
that fills their homes. Residents 
of this tourist and transportation 
hotspot, with the Ambassador 
Bridge right around the corner, 
have their air contaminated by 
toxic pollutants released from 
150 sites. It is the most polluted 
section of the most polluted ZIP 
code in the U.S.
The sky over Mexicantown is 
filled with chemicals released 
from coal and gas-powered 
power plants, the Marathon 
oil refinery, a steel mill and a 
wastewater 
treatment 
plant. 
The 
toxic 
chemicals 
being 
dumped into their community 
has decreased the air quality 
so severely that natives are 
three times more likely to be 
hospitalized with asthma than 
the average Michigander and 
face 
significantly 
increased 
rates of cancer and respiratory 
diseases. 
Instead 
of 
investing 
in 
cleaning 
the 
community, 
Detroit’s 
government 
has 
chosen to add another source 

of pollution to the mix. After 
destroying major parts of the 
historic neighborhood to build 
the new, six-lane Gordie Howe 
International Bridge, even more 
light, sound and air pollution 
will stream into the community. 
Detroiters, like Ann Arborites, 
are left with almost no recourse 
to fight the dumping of toxic 
chemicals into the resources 
they need to survive. This lack 
of rights is caused by the basic 
legal document that should 
ensure them: the United States 
Constitution.
While 
the 
Constitution 
promnises the right to life, it 
gives people no rights to the 
elements needed to live: clean 
air and water. It is a nonsensical 
legal 
paradox 
that 
keeps 
marginalized 
and 
prominent 
communities alike from using 
the courts to assert their basic 
human rights. With a Congress 
that 
has 
passed 
no 
major 
environmental 
legislation 
in 
decades, the Constitution might 
offer the only viable solution 
to a problem that is costing 
thousands of Americans their 
lives. 
America’s Constitution is one 
of the most important documents 
in human history, but even 
so, it seems like the Founding 

Fathers were in a hurry to get 
it done. It is one of the shortest 
national constitutions and is 
riddled with spelling errors, 
like 
“Pensylvania”. 
Written 
hundreds 
of 
years 
before 
conservation and ecology were 
concrete concepts, the writers 
also neglect to mention the 
environment, with all the power 
the government has to regulate 
it coming indirectly from the 
Commerce Clause. This is in 
stark contrast to almost any 
other nation, with 177 of the 193 
United Nations member states 
giving their people the right 
to the environment in their 
constitutions.
The effects of a constitutional 
right to the environment are far-
reaching, forcing governments 
to 
more 
tightly 
regulate 
polluters and more strongly 
protect 
communities 
from 
pollution. 
Most 
importantly, 
a constitutional right to the 
environment gives people the 
power and standing in court to 
fight back against polluters. 
In 
Argentina, 
the 
once-
heavily polluted Matanza River 
once ran red with the blood 
from the slaughterhouses that 
lined its banks, along with 
everything from mercury to oil. 
The millions of people that live 
along its shores saw decades 
of pollution take a toll on their 
health. In 2004, citizens from 
“Villa Inflamable”, a city deeply 
affected by the overwhelming 
pollution, filed a lawsuit against 
the governments of Argentina 
and 
Buenos 
Aires 
and 
44 
businesses for damage to their 
health caused by the pollution 
of the river, and won. Once 
named one of the most polluted 
places on Earth, the Matanza is 
still an industrial river, but the 
government of Argentina now 
works to ensure it gets a little 
cleaner every day.
People from The Netherlands, 
where the right to a survivable 
climate was secured in court, to 
the Ecuadorian Amazon, where 
communities are suing Chevron 
for over $9 billion for polluting 
the rainforest, have used their 
constitutional rights to protect 
themselves from corporations 
and their own governments. 
A 
constitutional 
right 
may 
very well be the solution to 
environmental 
injustice 
that 
runs 
rampant 
through 
our 
nation and especially our state. 
This would make courts the 
level playing field on which 
all 
Michiganders 
– 
from 
Ann Arborites, to Southwest 
Detroiters to those affected 
in Flint – could fight back 
against the state and federal 
governments on issues from 
the Line 5 pipeline to the 
constant corruption impeding 
justice for wrongfully poisoned 
communities. A constitutional 
amendment for the environment 
is the best chance Americans 
have at ensuring their lives are 
not sacrificed for profit.

Granowicz learning from emotion-driven error

Nick Granowicz could only 
watch. 
The freshman forward saw 
Wisconsin forward Cole Caufield 
skate with the puck from the right 
side of the boards over to center 
ice. Caufield spun to face the net 
as senior forward Nick Pastujov 
slid on his knees to try and block 
the shot. 
A shot never came though — 
Pastujov fell for Caufield’s fake 
shot deke.
Then 
senior 
defenseman 
Luke Martin dove on one knee 
attempting to do what Pastujov 
couldn’t, but it was too late. The 
puck had already left Caufield’s 
stick. 
A moment later, it connected 
with the back of the net.
The penalty box door swung 
open, 
and 
amid 
Wisconsin’s 
celebrations, Granowicz skated 
back to the bench — dejected at his 
costly mistake. 
He’d served just 56 seconds of 
his two-minute minor penalty for 
roughing. 
The call was the result of a 
punch Granowicz had thrown at 
a Badger play after the two had a 
battle on the boards.
As he sat on the bench, the 
reality of the situation hit him. 
The Wolverines’ two-goal lead 
was gone, and the Badgers were 
clawing their way back into the 
game because of his penalty.
“I felt horrible right after I 
did it,” Granowicz said. “I knew 
I messed up right away. I let my 
emotions kind of get the better of 
me. It was just a bad feeling. After 
they scored, it just made it even 
worse. I felt really bad because I 
let my teammates down at that 
point.”
After having a front-row view 
of Caufield’s goal from the box, 
Granowicz spent the remaining 
five-and-a-half 
minutes 
of 
Sunday’s 3-1 watching the game 
from a different vantage point — 
the bench.
But the decision wasn’t a 
punishment, rather a learning 

moment, according to Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. 
Pearson pointed out at that 
point, Wisconsin had all the 
momentum and was threatening 
to repeat a second comeback effort 
after scoring three unanswered 
goals to beat Michigan 3-2, 
on Saturday. So he used the 
repercussions of an untimely 
penalty as a way to teach the 
players what to do in the situation. 
It was an opportunity to show 
not only Granowicz, but the entire 
team, the importance of emotional 
control. 
“We’ve all done some things, 
taken 
some 
bad 
penalties,” 
Pearson said. “It’s a good learning 
lesson for our whole team, it’s an 
emotional game, we want guys to 
play with emotion, but it has to be 
controlled emotion.”
Caufield’s goal didn’t end up 
mattering. 
Forty-five 
seconds 
later, Ty Emberson received a 
five-minute major and a 10-minute 
game misconduct for contact with 
Pastujov’s head. The Wolverines 
caught a break and finished the 
game on the power play.
When senior forward Jake 
Slaker scored an empty net, power 
play goal, Granowicz breathed a 
sigh of relief. His momentary lapse 

in emotional control proved to be 
relatively inconsequential.
But still, Granowicz felt he 
owed his team an explanation. So 
in the locker room, he addressed 
his teammates.
“It’s just accountability and 
ownership 
for 
your 
actions,” 
Granowicz said. “If you mess 
up you should apologize to your 
teammates and tell them you’re 
sorry. Telling them you know you 
messed up. You’re sorry that you 
let them down, and you’re going 
to try and change and not let that 
happen again.”
No one on the team placed any 
blame on him. Slaker recalled 
two weekends ago when junior 
forward Michael Pastujov took 
a penalty after the whistle and 
negated a power-play opportunity 
for Michigan. The team wasn’t 
mad then, and it isn’t now.
Sometimes players lose control 
of their emotions. The important 
thing the Wolverines have chosen 
to emphasize is their willingness 
to reflect on the situation and 
learn from it.
“We were going to kill the 
penalty for him no matter what,” 
Slaker said. “(Granowicz) came 
in, and I thought he played a great 
game which is the most important 

part.”
For 
Granowicz, 
learning 
emotional control is part of the 
adjustment from junior to college 
hockey.
At the junior level, referees 
are sometimes more lenient with 
physical play. But in the NCAA, 
referees are more strict and aim to 
keep the game well controlled. 
This strictness hurt Granowicz 
especially — he hasn’t seen much 
lineup time this season, so the 
adjustment has been harsh. 
He’s only dressed four times, 
but he’s not using that as an excuse 
for his loss of control. Pearson’s 
message for him was well-received 
and well-understood — mistakes 
are okay, but it’s critical to grow 
from them.
Granowicz’s 
penalty 
aside, 
Pearson and his teammates were 
impressed with his performance. 
And while Sunday night proved 
an important learning moment for 
Granowicz, it granted Pearson a 
chance for reflection on the lineup 
decisions he’s been making. 
“I thought he had a really good 
game,” Pearson said. “For a kid 
who has only played three games, 
we’ve got to play him more, coach 
isn’t playing him enough. We’ve 
got to get him involved.”

Uche declares for NFL, 
Anthony enters portal 

Linebacker Josh Uche has 
announced that he will declare 
for the NFL draft, though he 
will still play in Michigan’s 
bowl game.
“Me and my family have 
made the decision to forego 
my final season of eligibility 
and enter my name in the NFL 
Draft,” Uche said in a statement 
on Twitter. “I am still working 
hard with my teammates to win 
our 10th game of the season 
in the Bowl Game and I am 
excited to represent Michigan 
one last time.
“I want to thank Coach 
(Jim) Harbaugh, Coach (Don) 
Brown, and all my coaches for 
believing in a kid from Miami, 
Florida and giving me a chance 
to come to Michigan. Thank 
you for pushing me to be my 
very best in every way and for 
giving me the chance to be a 
Wolverine.”
One of the Wolverines’ top 
pass-rushers 
the 
past 
two 
years, Uche played in all 12 
games this season and finished 
with 11.5 tackles for loss, 8.5 
sacks, six quarterback hurries 
and two forced fumbles. He 

was named to the All-Big Ten 
second team by coaches and the 
third team by media.
Uche is officially listed as 
a senior on Michigan’s roster 
but played in just four games 
his 
freshman 
year. 
With 
the new four-game redshirt 
rule coming into effect last 
year, Uche potentially could 
have earned an extra year 
of eligibility should he have 
chosen to remain with the 
program.
Additionally, 
redshirt 
sophomore linebacker Jordan 
Anthony 
has 
entered 
the 
transfer portal, per reports. 
Anthony 
was 
a 
four-star 
prospect out of IMG Academy 
in Florida but has played in 
just 16 games in two years and 
had little impact on the stat 
sheet. In 2019, he appeared in 
nine games and finished with 
11 tackles and a quarterback 
hurry.
Anthony has not commented 
publicly on his decision, but his 
spot in the linebacker rotation 
was in question due to redshirt 
freshman Cameron McGrone’s 
emergence at middle linebacker 
and junior Josh Ross’ decision 
to redshirt this season after 
injury.

First-half scoring woes cripple ‘M’

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Not 
much about the KFC Yum! 
Center in downtown Louisville 
is quiet.
The 
coaches 
who 
shout 
directions at their players from 
the sidelines? Not quiet. 
The teams’ benches, which 
cheer 
on 
their 
teammates, 
protest every call against them 
and urge for the whistle in 
indignation every time one of 
their players is touched? Not 
quiet. 
And 
22,000 
screaming 
Cardinals fans, decked out in 
white and waving matching 
rally towels above their heads? 
Definitely not quiet. 
But No. 4 Michigan’s first-
half offense on Tuesday night? 
Quieter than the Law Library 
before finals week.
Gone was the efficient ball-
screen offense. Gone was junior 
forward Eli Brooks’ success 
from the arc. Gone was senior 
center Jon Teske’s dominance 
in the paint.
Gone, for all accounts and 
purposes, was the Wolverines’ 
offensive attack.
“A lot of the shots just 
weren’t falling,” Teske said 

after the game. “I told the 
team, just keep shooting those 
same shots.”
In the first half, Michigan 
shot for a dismal 17 percent on 
its three-point attempts, and 
an even worse 11 percent on its 
layups. The Wolverines shot 
only 33 percent in the paint and 
11 percent on second-chance 
scoring attempts. 
They just couldn’t find the 
bottom of the net.
Some 
of 
it 
could 
be 
attributed to the Cardinals’ 
defense, which was effective 
all night at shutting down 
Michigan’s 
ball 
screens 
— 
plays that have set up much 
of the Wolverines’ success on 
offense this season. But not all 
of Michigan’s offensive woes 
can be credited to Louisville. 
The Wolverines had plenty 
of scoring opportunities, and 
even managed to open up a few 
easy shots for themselves. Even 
then, it seemed they were only 
hitting rim and backboard. 
“We missed some shots that 
normally go in,” said Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard. 
In the second half, Michigan 
had at least somewhat more 
success 
offensively, 
even 
drawing 
within 
a 
four-
point margin at one point. 

But by then, it was too late. 
The Cardinals had taken a 
10-point lead into the break, 
and from there, the game was 
never really in question again. 
Though the Wolverines drew 
closer at various points in the 
second half, the damage was 
already done. The outcome 
of the game was, by then, 
unavoidable. 
The Cardinals were far from 
the juggernaut they’ve been at 
times this season on Tuesday 
night. It’s a credit to Michigan’s 
defense that they weren’t. But 
on offense, the Wolverines just 
couldn’t quite do enough. As 
low-scoring and as gritty as 
this game was, Louisville was, 
simply put, the better team.
And 
for 
this 
game 
— 
Michigan’s offense the only 
quiet thing about it — that was 
enough. 
“We messed up a lot of 
assignments 
that 
we 
had 
coming into the game,” said 
junior forward Isaiah Livers. 
“We’ll keep taking the same 
shots. They fall, they fall, 
they don’t — let’s get back and 
defend.

Wolverines looking for signature win

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team has made short 
order of most of its opponents. 
Mid-major teams like Morgan 
State, Eastern Michigan and 
Bradley 
have 
offered 
little 
resistance, and as a result, the 
Wolverines’ six wins came at an 
average margin of 23 points. 
But against Notre Dame — the 
only real challenge Michigan 
has faced — the Wolverines fell, 
76-72, their only loss so far this 
season. While the loss has little 
impact on the team’s goals for the 
remainder of the season, it raises 
question marks about whether it 
can truly compete in Big Ten play 
this year. 
Michigan has an opportunity 
to answer some of those questions 
at Crisler Center Thursday night, 
when it hosts Syracuse in the Big 
Ten/ACC Challenge. 
Though the Orange dropped 
out 
of 
the 
rankings 
after 
consecutive losses to Stanford 
and Green Bay, they received the 
most votes outside the Top 25 in 
both the AP and Coaches’ Polls, 
effectively making them the No. 
26 team in the country. Much like 
the Wolverines, they’ll be looking 
to notch their first signature win 
and build some momentum going 
into conference play. 

Offensively, 
much 
of 
Syracuse’s 
production 
comes 
from beyond the arc. Despite 
shooting just 31 percent from 
three so far this year, the Orange 
rank 13th nationally in 3-pointers 
made, sinking 9.6 triples per 
game. 
Guard 
Gabrielle 
Cooper 
exemplifies 
this 
average 
efficiency, high volume style of 
play. So far this year, she has sunk 
14 of her 51 attempted 3-pointers 
— both numbers the most on the 
team. She is followed closely by 
forward Digna Strautmane, who 
has shot a slightly more efficient 
13-for-41, good for 31.7 percent 
from beyond the arc. 

But Syracuse’s most valuable 
offensive weapon by far is 
guard Kiara Lewis. The Ohio 
State transfer was thrust into 
the starting role after ACC 
Player of the Year candidate 
Tiana Mangakahia was forced 
to redshirt to recover from 
chemotherapy treatments. 
Lewis has shined in her new 
role, leading the team in both 
points and assists per game — 15.9 
and 6.0, respectively. Her ability 
to drive the lane and draw fouls 
adds diversity to the Orange’s 
offensive 
attack 
and 
forces 
opponents to play tentatively to 
avoid fouling out. 
“They can go inside-out, and 
they shoot a ton of threes,” said 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “So it’s going to be a real 
test for us (defensively).”
Syracuse also boasts a defense 
that matches up well against the 
Wolverines’ struggles to take care 
of the ball on offense. Michigan 
averages over 16 turnovers per 
game, and its 24 giveaways were 
crucial in the loss to Notre Dame. 
The Orange’s signature zone 
defense — as well as their length 
and quickness in the guard spot 
— could cause similar problems 
for the Wolverines’ turnover-
prone offense. 
“We 
have 
to 
limit 
our 
turnovers,” said senior guard 
Akienreh Johnson. “(We have to) 
score on the offensive end on the 
best shot every single time we’re 
on offense. Take pride in our 
possessions.”
Michigan 
showed 
promise 
against 
Morgan 
State 
on 
Sunday, when it followed up a 
12-turnover first half with only 
three in the second half. That 
change will need to stick if the 
Wolverines want to pick up their 
first signature win Thursday 
night. 
“They’re a tremendous team,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We need to 
be able to handle their pressure, 
their length, and their zone 
defense … It’s going to be a great 
opportunity for us to get another 
great opponent at home.”

After losing two All-Americans, Wolverines look toward their future

Walking into the Donald R. 
Shepherd Gymnastics Center, 
it’s near impossible to miss the 
maize and blue championship 
banners that hang in rows all 
across the ceiling. The flags — 
26 in total — create an imposing 
image against the white interior 
of the building, a constant 
reminder 
of 
the 
program’s 
success.
Freshman Gabby Wilson felt 
the weight of those banners long 
before she came to Michigan. 
Growing 
up 
in 
Ypsilanti, 
Wilson 
was 
always 
in 
the 
stands for the 
Wolverines’ 
home 
meets, 
watching 
All-
Americans like 
Sarah 
Curtis 
and 
Natalie 
Beilstein. Since 
being recruited 
her freshman year of high 
school, she’s been waiting in the 
wings, seeing Michigan rack 
up wins year after year. Now 
continuing that legacy falls on 
Wilson’s shoulders. 
“The 
hardest 
part 
(of 
the 
transition 
to 
collegiate 
gymnastics) was getting used to 
the pride of the ‘block M’ because 
in high school, we did club 
gymnastics,” 
Wilson 
said. 
“We 
weren’t 
representing our 
school and our 
sport at the same 
time. You don’t 
want to put too 
much 
pressure 
on yourself, but 
you also want to 
give your school 
a reputation.”
Michigan 
has 
quite 
a 
reputation 
already, 
clinching 
five of the last seven regular-
season Big Ten titles and 17 Big 
Ten championship wins since 

2000. With 24 titles, Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki is the most 
decorated gymnastics coach in 
the conference by a mile. The 
runner-up has just five. Last 
year, the team continued that 
success all the way to the NCAA 
Championships 
where 
they 
finished third behind UCLA and 
LSU. 
In 
recent 
history, 
the 
Wolverines’ dominance of the 
Big Ten can be largely traced 
to All-Americans and recent 
graduates 
Olivia 
Karas 
and 
Emma McLean. They held 60 
event 
and 
all-around 
titles, 
four 
NCAA 
Championship 
appearances 
and 100 routines 
scoring 9.90 or 
higher. The duo 
set the bar high 
in the gym and 
out of it, serving 
as 
leaders 
and 
helping to create 
the team culture. 
“Last 
year 
was a pretty specially year,” 
Plocki said. “I think for a lot of 
reasons, but one of them was 
definitely the leadership we had 
with Emma and Olivia. You can 
lead vocally and you can lead by 
example. Both of those two did 
both. They walked the talk. They 
were committed. They worked 
hard everyday. I think that they 
gave everything that they had 
and then some.”
After 
losing 
two 
dominant 
members of the 
team, 
Plocki 
and the rest of 
the 
coaching 
staff 
got 
right 
to work making 
plans 
for 
this 
upcoming season. 
In the end of year 
meetings 
last 
spring, the coaches analyzed 
the Wolverines’ strengths and 
how they could be replicated the 
following year. They came to the 
consensus they had to recreate 

the culture developed by Karas 
and McLean. 
“They laid the framework 
for us (current) seniors,” said 
senior captain Maddy Osman. 
“My 
whole 
class 
has 
kind of taken 
what they’ve 
done. 
We’ve 
taken 
their 
leadership, 
their 
skills, 
the way that 
they 
cheer, 
the 
way 
that 
they 
embodied the 
‘block M’ and transitioned it into 
this year.”
Plocki is confident in the 
team’s ability to pick up where 
they left off, both in terms of 

team chemistry and depth of 
talent across the squad. The 
returning athletes have a strong 
track record with three All-
Americans, 
including 
Osman 
and 
second-time 
captain, senior Lexi 
Funk, still on the 
roster. 
Purely 
looking 
at the numbers, the 
freshman 
class, 
considered one of 
the best recruiting 
classes 
in 
the 
country, balance out 
the loss of Karas and 
McLean. With three 
freshmen who compete for the 
all-around title replacing two 
seniors — one of whom didn’t 
always perform every event — 
the team should statistically be 

in a better spot coming into this 
season. 
“The potential is huge,” Plocki 
said. “Gabby Wilson and Sierra 
Brooks 
are 
just 
straight 
up 
rockstars. Nicoletta 
Koulos 
is 
going 
to be the secret 
weapon 
of 
our 
season. She doesn’t 
have quite the level 
of difficulty in her 
skills, but I think 
she’s a competitor. 
She’s 
beautiful 
to 
watch 
and 
she’s very clean. I 
think those three 
freshmen can make a huge impact.”
While Wilson and the rest of the 
newcomers may feel the pressure 
of those banners now, Plocki thinks 
they’ll feel differently after their 

first competition this weekend, an 
exhibition against Central, Eastern 
and Western Michigan. 
“It’s a big responsibility to 
represent the ‘block M’,” Plocki 
said. “This is the 
hard part. It’s all 
the preparation 
for the fun part 
that starts with 
competition. 
Then — all of 
the pressure of 
representing 
that ‘block M’ 
— you get to see 
the reward of 
that. All of the 
sudden, not only is it easier, but 
that pride starts to bubble up 
inside of you. The next thing you 
know, you’re preaching that to 
the next class of freshmen.”

Simpson, Michigan struggle to overcome Louisville’s ball-screen defense

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — When 
Michigan hired Juwan Howard, 
it wasn’t much of a secret that 
the Wolverines would try their 
hand at an up-tempo, pro-style 
offense grounded in the pick-
and-roll.
Leading 
up 
to 
Tuesday 
night’s 
game 
against 
top-
ranked Louisville (8-0), the No. 
4 Michigan men’s basketball 
team (7-1) had found its callin 

card in exactly that. Coming 
off 
wins 
against 
then-No. 
6 North Carolina and No. 8 
Gonzaga at the Battle 4 Atlantis 
Tournament in which they 
averaged over 75 points per 
game, the Wolverines’ ball-
screen offense was rolling.
As for what Michigan had 
to show for it, senior point 
guard Zavier Simpson — a 
preseason All-Big Ten selection 
— 
entered 
Tuesday 
night 
leading the nation in assists. 
His 
effectiveness 
in 
both 

passing and finishing at the rim 
out of the pick-and-roll was a 
driving force to the Wolverines’ 
undefeated November.
But on Tuesday night, the 
Cardinals 
made 
it 
difficult 
for him to do either from the 
start. They hedged hard on 
some screens and sagged off 
of 
others, 
leaving 
Simpson 
uncertain of what to expect. 
Ultimately, Michigan’s offense 
struggled to adapt in its 58-43 
loss.
In the Wolverines’ first seven 
games, Simpson 
shredded 
opposing 
defenses 
with 
three 
actions 
coming out of 
ball 
screens: 
taking it to the 
rim 
himself, 
dishing 
to 
the 
rolling 
or 
popping 
screener, 
or 
swinging a cross-court pass 
to a shooter. With an arsenal 
of chest passes, hook passes 
and bounce passes, his success 
rate at even the most damning 
angles made Michigan’s offense 
an efficient work of art.
For 
Cardinals’ 
coach 
Chris 
Mack, 
game-planning 
against the nation’s assists 
leader proved to be the most 
challenging aspect of facing the 
Wolverines.
“(Simpson) 
is 
very, 
very 
quick,” Mack said. “He’ll reject 
a lot of ball screens, he’ll act 
like he’s using it 
and then drive 
the space and 
kick. 
Teams 
have 
tried 
to 
go under, and 
Zavier 
is 
so 
clever, he just 
plays 
peek-a-
boo and figures 
out which side 
you’re 
trying 
to 
catch 
him 
on then he goes down the lane 
with 
that 
Kareem 
(Abdul-
Jabbar) hook.” 
Regardless of which move 
Simpson tried in the early 
going, all 6-foot-10 of Louisville 

center Steve Enoch stood in 
his way. The Cardinals began 
the game by hedging high on 
ball screens, making Simpson’s 
passing angles difficult.
The impact was easy to see. 
Michigan missed its first five 
shots. Soon, it was 1-of-10 from 
the floor. Then the struggles 
amounted to a 2-for-17 stretch 
and 
a 
double-digit 
deficit. 
By the end of the night, the 
Wolverines were staring at a 
15-point loss, and the zero in 
their loss column was no longer 
intact.
On the other 
bench, all Mack 
could 
do 
was 
smile and fold 
his arms.
“It 
starts 
with 
Zavier,” 
Mack said. “The 
deeper he gets 
in the lane, the 
more 
it 
puts 
your 
off-ball 
defenders in a bind. How much 
do I help in? In the Bahamas, 
he’d just get in the lane and 
spray it out, and (junior forward 
Isaiah) Livers and (junior guard 
Eli) Brooks, they couldn’t miss. 
And so all we talked about was 
keeping him out of the lane, and 
then hard closeouts, hands are 
early. I really didn’t think they 
generated a whole lot of good 
looks.”
For the first time all season, 
Michigan struggled to get the 
ball into the paint. And for 
the first time all season, an 
offense 
that 
entered Tuesday 
night averaging 
over 80 points 
per game went 
silent.
“Our 
goal 
was 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
we 
could get those 
paint 
touches 
that 
we 
were 
comfortable 
with getting throughout the 
year thus far,” Howard said. “ 
… (Louisville) did a really good 
job of compacting the paint, 
keeping us out of the paint 
going downhill.”

B-SIDE: MUSIC NOTEBOOK

For better or for worse, black metal broke the mold 
in the 2010s. It was a long time coming, too. From its 
inception in the early ’80s until shortly before 2010, 
black metal, with regard to both its sound and its 
culture, had barely budged. In any other genre, this is 
a completely foreign idea — artists are supposed to live 
and breathe, experiment and develop. But not in black 
metal. In black metal, bands are supposed to live within 
the common sounds of the genre, nudging up against the 
boundaries but never pushing (or even breaking) them. 
Before, artists were supposed to look, sound and carry 
themselves a certain way, or else they were doomed to a 
lackluster, dead-end career. In the past 10 years, though, 
bands suddenly stopped caring and started doing their 
own thing, and some bands became very popular as a 
result. To some, this was a long time coming. To others, 
though, this was damn near the end of the world. 
You see, metal purists (especially black metal purists) 
want to be familiar with every piece of music they hear. 
They want to be surprised by how each artist bends the 
genre to meet their desired sound, but they don’t want 
any curveballs. They want what they know, and they 
don’t care about anything else. So when black metal 
began to turn outward in the early 2010s, heads from 
every corner of the music world turned. Critics began 
to find themselves drawn to new black metal musings. 
Casual music fans began to dip their toes into the 
subgenre. Notably, though, metal heads began to turn 
a blind eye to the progress that lay in front of them. As 
black metal began to turn to the sky, the heads began to 
look to the stagnant pond that is metal, pretending their 
world remained unaltered.
The first band to really break the mold was Liturgy, 
a group of Brooklyn hipsters (largely unversed in 
black metal) led by vocalist/guitarist/theorist Hunter 
Hunt-Hendrix. In 2009, Hunt-Hendrix released a 

manifesto titled “Transcendental Black Metal: A 
Vision of Apocalyptic Humanism” at a black metal 
theory conference. The manifesto explained the idea 
of transcendental (American) black metal, a subgenre 
of metal that could transcend the “Haptic Void,” the 
imaginary boundary that contains all other forms of 
metal, a task that Hyperborean (Scandinavian) black 
metal could never accomplish given its fixation on death, 
executed through its signature pummeling and lifeless 
drum technique, the blast beat. Transcendental black 
metal, focused instead on life and growth, was to be 
accomplished through the burst beat, a drum technique 
that lives and breathes as each song progresses. Don’t get 
it misconstrued, though: the music is still heavy, but it 
attempts to reach a higher plane. Given the radical ideas 
and rampant experimentation they fostered, Liturgy 
was met with some serious backlash. In fact, some 
claimed that they were nothing more than hipsters set 
out to ruin another good thing. Others claimed that they 
were too pretentious and didn’t carry the spirit of black 
metal.
Liturgy came close to realizing transcendental black 
metal with the release of 2009’s Renihilation (the opposite 
of annihilation), but it didn’t quite meet the mark. It was 
still heavily influenced by the so-called Hyperborean 
black metal, but moments like the chilling, evolving 
“Ecstatic Rite” show the potential of transcendental 
black metal. The band came even closer with 2012’s 
incredible (and incredibly polarizing) Aesthetica. The 
album broke the boundaries of black metal with songs 
like “Sun of Light” and “Red Crown,” but it didn’t quite 
transcend the Haptic Void. After 2015’s misstep The Ark 
Work, the electronic and hip hop influenced release that 
left fans flustered, it seemed that the band had run its 
course. The Ark Work simply was not metal, nor could 
anyone consider it to be metal. Liturgy, specifically 
Hunt-Hendrix, jumped too high and inevitably missed 
the mark. However, after an electronic release from 
Hunt-Hendrix and four years away from the genre, 
2019’s surprise release, H.A.Q.Q., set Liturgy back on the 

right course, keeping things metal as hell but correctly 
introducing electronic and glitch elements. From heavy 
hitters brimming with life and humanity like “GOD 
OF LOVE” and “HAJJ” that utilize electronic stutter 
steps in lieu of sonic progressions to challenging yet 
palate-cleansing interludes like “EXACO I,” H.A.Q.Q. is 
evidence that even though it will not be easy, eventually, 
Liturgy will transcend the Haptic Void. Black metal 
purists be damned, the band has already begun to 
transform, and there’s no reason for them to stop in the 
next decade.
Similarly, the advent of atmospheric black metal 
has ruffled the feathers of many metalheads. Bands 
were creating rock and alternative-infused black metal 
that more resembled the Cure than it did Darkthrone. 
Expectedly, metalheads were largely unhappy, and no 
band made them more unhappy than San Francisco’s 
Deafheaven. Formed in 2010, the band released Roads 
to Judah in 2011. Musically, the album was typical black-
metal fare, but with a twist. Rather than an onslaught 
of destruction, the violence was often broken up with 
glistening piano and acoustic guitar ballads. They 
are, like so many other boundary-pushing black 
metal acts, inspired by Japan’s Envy, one of the 
first bands to blend black metal with countless 
softer, more accessible genres. Lyrically, the album 
diverged from black metal’s typical depictions of 
the wilderness and critiques on various religious 
and governmental institutions, instead focusing 
on vocalist and lyricist George Clarke’s substance 
abuse and general tomfoolery. The album was 
generally a success, finding a home on several year-
end lists, but it started to make purists grumble. 
Once again, the hipsters were dead-set on ruining 
yet another good thing.
Deafheaven didn’t stop there, though. Their 
next release, 2013’s Sunbather, blew the iron gates 

of black metal wide open. First of all, the album cover 
was vibrant peachy-pink. Never has this color ever been 
associated with black metal. Second, the music — it was 
beautiful, often crushingly so. Just listen to “Dream 
House,” far and away the band’s most popular song. 
Guitarist and songwriter Kerry McCoy introduced 
elements of shoegaze and new wave (two very un-black-
metal genres) to the band’s sound (hence The Cure 
comparisons). Third, and finally, the lyrics. Similar to 
the idea of Transcendental black metal, Clarke writes 
about life. However, he writes about man’s never-ending 
pursuit of perfection and man’s accompanying, inevitable 
failure. Critics adored this album, which made black 
metal purists hate it even more than they already did. On 
top of this experimentation, the members of Deafheaven 
are conventionally normal looking and could potentially 
function normally within society, which is inherently 
not very metal. Worse yet, the members of Deafheaven 
like other genres of music, including hip hop, a genre 
generally disliked by metalheads for its materialism and 
supposed lack of lyrical depth.

The best selling poet of 2017 wasn’t Shakespeare, 
Homer or William Blake. It was Rupi Kaur, a 27-year-
old Indian-Canadian woman whose success can be 
largely attributed to her following on Instagram. In fact, 
so-called “Instapoets” made up 12 of the top 20 best 
selling poets in 2017.
Anyone with a passing interest in poetry has likely 
encountered Instapoets in their social media feed. 
They’ve come to define much of the literature of the 
decade. Their poems often deal with themes like 
relationships, loneliness and mental health. Their 
meanings are clear so a reader can usually “get it” on the 
first read. Most importantly, they’re short, making them 
perfectly suited for the brief encounters social media was 
structured for. 
Instapoets have almost single-handedly brought 
poetry back into the mainstream, and yet they’re taken 
less seriously than “real” poets. There’s a tacit assumption 
that their poems are about just feelings and emotions and 
can’t be compared to their print-only counterparts. The 
critique, when fully thought out, is that Kaur and other 
Instapoets too often oversimplify their work, hoping to 
appeal to a large audience, and supposedly resulting in 
poetry that’s hollow and boring.
While there’s truth to this claim, it would be 
irresponsible to dismiss Instapoets without asking why a 
social media presence seems to diminish their legitimacy. 
One similarity among many popular Instapoets is that 
their pages aren’t simply free spaces where they casually 
share new pieces; these pages are polished, deliberate 
and well thought out. More than just a platform to share 
poetry, they are an effective marketing tool. There are 
promotional materials, book release dates and clear 
intents to build a brand. They’re reminiscent of the pages 
of Instagram models — they blend a carefully curated 
marketing message with an intimate space to share and 

interact with fans. 
The use of social media as a business tool isn’t an 
innovative practice. It is difficult to find a sizable company 
without a twenty-something “Social Media Specialist” in 
its marketing department. It would simply be an oversight 
to sell anything without having some kind of social media 
presence, so any poet trying to make money will follow 
suit. Social media, however, tends to favor smaller units 
of content as many accounts compete for the limited 
attention of users. Platforms reinforce this tendency with 
character limits, dense layouts and systems of ranking 
posts with an eye for maximizing advertising revenue at 
the expense of long-form content.
What we find is that medium dictates form. Poets 
have to meet their audience where they are, and where 
these readers reside is a space that is hyper-commodified. 
Everything, right down to a user’s attention, can have a 
price tag and be sold to the highest bidder. Poets, whose 
content can’t cleanly fit into this paradigm, are forced into 
the impossible task of competing with actors willing to 
instantly gratify a user’s base impulse in search of profit. 
It is then unsurprising that Rupi Kaur’s specific 
brand of poetry is notoriously able to capitalize on social 
media’s potential for content promotion. That being 
said, the success of Instapoets on social media is not an 
affirmative indictment of their quality. Despite what a 
tenured English professor might have to say about them, 
Instapoets have attracted an otherwise disinterested 
audience to poetry. In doing so, they’ve expanded into 
subject matters that were previously ignored, and have 
been highly inclusive of marginalized communities. 
These are poems that are worth something to many 
people, and there’s no reason to be concerned about that. 
Instapoets as they exist aren’t the issue. It is the limiting 
constraints of social media that keep so many Instapoets 
from ever being called poets.

Instapoetry, then and now

B-SIDE: BOOKS NOTEBOOK

In January 2010, I sat in the waiting room of a 
doctor’s office, squirming impatiently in an oversized 
chair — the entire room was designed for adults, but 
I was only 11. On the side table next to me sat the 
obligatory vase of fake flowers and pile of severely 
outdated magazines. On top was the previous 
December’s edition of TIME. The front cover offered a 
sneak peek of the issue’s topic: a decade in review. The 
rest of that memory is quite blurry. I don’t remember 
where the office was or what I was there for, but that 
red cover sticks out like a bright light. Barely older than 
a decade myself, the concept of 10 years was hard to 
wrap my young head around. I remember wondering 
where I’d be the next time TIME had to make another 
decade in review.
And here we are. I haven’t checked in with the 
offices of TIME, but The Daily will do.
Despite my ongoing disbelief and denial that 2020 
is right around the corner, I will acknowledge that I 
feel quite removed from that girl in the doctor’s office. 
She is hidden deep inside the dustiest of my brain’s file 
cabinets. I don’t remember the specifics of her day-to-
day thoughts, but in retrospect I do know that she was 
in for a whirlwind of a decade.
In 2010, the iPhone was barely three years old. None 
of my friends nor I owned any sort of cell phone and 
the only screens in my house were an old box TV and a 
desktop computer.
Later that year, Instagram came to fruition. In 
2011, Snapchat would be founded by a trio of friends 
at Stanford University. Vine started in 2012, only to 
receive an ongoing international mourning upon its 
demise in 2016 — that same year — TikTok was born.
All of this is to say: my 2010-childhood world was 
teetering on the brink of an unprecedented social 
media revolution. At the same time that our parents 

and grandparents grappled with a world turned 
upside down, my generation became tasked with 
finding our places within the rubble. This challenge 
came alongside a decade of pop culture that would 
permanently define our coming of age.
Such experiences made for many interesting 
debates, a handful of seriously influential events and 
a constant cascade of new memes. I gave up on my 
attempt to list all of them. Instead, here is my highlight 
reel. Consider it my own version of a Vine compilation.
2010: At the MTV Music Awards, Lady Gaga walked 
the red carpet in perhaps the most infamous fashion 
statement of all time: her meat dress. I was barely old 
enough to be deciding on middle school dance outfits, 
none of which involved steak.
2011: The final Harry Potter film hit theaters and 
ended a full childhood of fandom.
2012: I was in eighth grade when a man shot and 
killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook 
Elementary School. I remember sitting in my morning 
English class the day that the story broke, looking up 
at a teacher who I worshipped. He’d been teaching for 
far longer than I’d been alive, but I still remember the 
look of his eyes that day, searching for answers that he 
did not have.
2013: The Jonas Brothers cited “creative differences” 
upon announcing their breakup, wreaking havoc on 
pre-teen fans across the world.
2014: Over Thanksgiving vacation I watched 
my cousin, a St. Louis native, stream the footage of 
Missouri v. Darren Wilson after the police shooting 
of Michael Brown. After the officer’s acquittal, I saw 
friends and strangers rally behind the newly formed 
Black Lives Matter. At the time, I did not realize or 
understand the importance and longevity of the 
anger that sat behind the hashtag.

The thoughtful thrifter
On Aug. 27, 2012, Macklemore released his 
hit single, “Thrift Shop.” In it, the Seattle-
raised rapper lists the gems he’s discovered 
at his local thrift store, from a leopard-print 
mink to a flannel button-up donated by 
someone’s grandpa. He pities all the jerks who 
waste money on designer clothes and flexes by 
telling us how little his pre-worn pieces cost 
(“I’m gonna pop some tags / Only got $20 in my 
pocket”). Bragging about saving money was a 
massive lyrical departure for the mainstream 
rap of 2012 — the year’s other chart-topping 
songs included Drake’s “Started From the 
Bottom,” an anthem for getting rich or dying 
trying. Still, “Thrift Shop” soared high, 
spending six weeks at the number-one spot on 
the Billboard Hot 100.
“Thrift Shop” didn’t do well in spite of 
its anti-mass market messaging; it did well 
because of it. Just two years into the second 
decade of the millennium, the youth of 
America were ready to embrace a new form of 
conspicuous consumption, one that finds more 
allure in a pair of old gator shoes than a $50 
T-shirt.

The 2010s introduced the U.S. to a wave 
of conscious consumerism. National media 
warned us to watch out for greenwashing, 
or 
misguided 
marketing 
schemes 
from 
corporations 
hoping 
to 
appear 
eco-
friendly. Once a burden to mass production, 
sustainability became the focus of a new 
generation of Instagram-friendly clothing 
brands 
like 
Reformation 
and 
Girlfriend 
Collective. 
Perhaps 
the 
most 
accessible 
sustainable practice to gain traction during 
the decade? Secondhand shopping.
From 2010 to 2019, my wardrobe has 
transformed 
from 
a 
collection 
of 
mall-
purchased clothes to a mish-mash of mostly 
preowned pieces. If my estimates are right, 
I’ve purchased no more than 30 new garments 
in the decade, which isn’t a lot considering I 
went through puberty during that time frame. 
In my 10 years shopping at predominantly 
vintage and thrift establishments, I’ve come 
to the conclusion that there are three kinds of 
secondhand shoppers: those who know it’s the 
most sustainable way to shop, those who want 
to save money and those who, like Macklemore, 
just want to wear your grandad’s clothes. All 
are valid reasons to choose used over new 
clothing, and they’re not mutually exclusive. 
You can thrift because you fear climate change 
and because you’re tight on funds and because 

you love the look of an ’80s windbreaker.
As the 2010s draw to a close and the impacts 
of climate change become more dire, I realize 
that no motive for secondhand shopping is 
more dignified than the next. If you’re doing 
it, you’re hurting the earth a little bit less than 
you could be. It doesn’t matter why.

The 
cosmetic 
connoisseur
The 
past 
decade 
has 
witnessed 
a 
shift 
in 
consumer 
preferences 
to 
beauty products that are 
better for the environment 
and 
society. 
The 
2010s 
saw 
us 
moving 
toward 
brands that contain more 
ethically sourced, natural 
ingredients 
that 
provide 
sustainable packaging. The 
decade started off with 
companies 
prioritizing 
performance 
above 
all 
else, 
characterized 
by 
color cosmetics and pop 
looks. However, the beauty 

industry shifted gears some time in the past 
few years, and the spotlight shifted to clean 
ingredients, “no-makeup” looks and more 
positive associations with concepts like the 
aging of the body. This is reflected by the 
changing popularity of brands, as shown by 
companies like Glossier and Philosophy gaining 
traction while demand for traditional industry 
leaders like Olay and Estée 
Lauder has slowed down. 
Additionally, 
terms 
such 
as “sustainable,” “ethical” 
and “vegan” are now more 
commonplace 
than 
ever, 
with a 175 percent increase 
in the launch of vegan 
products between 2013 and 
2018. However, the impact 
of these shifts has been 
restricted by a single factor: 
the price tag. Even in 2019, 
the most popular products 
that meet the golden trifecta 
of being clean, ethical and 
sustainable tend to be way 
out of the price range for an 
ordinary college student.

Television shows can be immortalized in a number of ways. 
Perhaps it’s a character like The Fonz from “Happy Days,” who 
haunts our lives and Henry Winkler’s to this day. Or maybe it’s a 
catchphrase like “You got it dude!” uttered in “Full House” by a 
much-less-terrifying Olsen twin. Even a setting, like the Central Perk 
coffee shop of “Friends,” can launch a TV show into everlasting fame. 
But among these quirks and traits, there is one element of television 
that is both wildly important and vastly underrated: the theme song.
Like the score to a movie but arguably much more important, a TV 
show’s theme song sets the tone for the entire series. Take one of the 
most famous, “Where Everybody Knows Your Name,” of “Cheers” 
fame. The soft piano, banging chorus and melancholy lyrics perfectly 
mirrors the escape from the brutality of life the show’s bar provides 
its characters. Or the catchy rap of “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” 
that literally details the entire background to the series. How could 
we possibly understand what was going on if we didn’t hear that Will 
Smith got into one little fight and his mom got scared, so he had to 
move in with his auntie and uncle in Bel-Air?
Theme songs are a unifying force among people 
who love a show and those who hate it. Even if 
the characters and plotlines of “Friends” send you 
spiraling into a fit of rage, you’re still going to do the 
four claps when called for. Does “Full House” make 
you want to punch Bob Saget a little? Too bad, you’ll 
be wondering whatever happened to predictability 
everywhere you go.
Every theme song I’ve mentioned so far is just that 
— a full-blown song. The themes of pre-21st century 
were long and cheesy, featuring some band you haven’t 
heard of singing vague references to the show. This 
changed in the years approaching the 2000s. With 
some exceptions, most contemporary shows rely on 
an instrumental to define themselves; it’s a brilliant 
display of sound association. What was before just 
some dramatic orchestral music will have you thinking 
of “The Simpsons” for the rest of your life. All one has 
to do is look at the impact that “Law and Order”’s dun-
dun has had on society to understand this phenomena.
But some shows are more successful at this than 
others, and some theme songs will fall from the 
public’s mind while others will be associated with 
their series forever. In the past decade, some of the 

best theme songs of all time have kept us from clicking “Skip Intro” 
on our streaming services. For the sake of options, I’ll be talking 
about (not ranking) shows that may have started before 2010, but that 
ended in this decade or are still airing today. So as much as it kills me 
to have to leave out the absolute banger that is the “That ’70s Show” 
theme, it won’t be included here. All of these themes are also solely 
instrumental, so Zooey Deschanel will have to remain locked up in her 
fairy castle for yet another day.
“Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Frolic” by Luciano Michelini
Leave it to Larry David to use a short and springy theme that 
perfectly captures the mediocrity of life. “Curb Your Enthusiasm”’s 
bouncy theme combines a tuba and a mandolin to accent the ridiculous 
mishaps and embarrassments of David’s life. The way the tuba pomp 
pomp pomps in before the strings take over is pure genius, capturing 
a human emotion of absurdity that words cannot. The theme song has 
taken on a life of its own, becoming a meme and the go-to music to 
edit over any stupid event that occurs. The title of the theme, “Frolic,” 
further embodies the essence of “Curb” as Larry David scampers 
through life in yet another show about nothing.
“Bojack Horseman,” “Bojack’s Theme” by Patrick and Ralph 
Carney
Similar to “Curb,” “Bojack” is a mildly depressing show that’s 

thematically centered around the mundanity of life. The theme 
song’s psychedelic synths are drowned out by horns as the colors 
of Bojack’s life flash behind him while he stares, emotionless. The 
theme embodies the confusion that Bojack faces as he tries to turn 
his life around, bouncing back and forth between who he once was 
and who he is now. The theme is slightly mournful, rounding out an 
artistic commentary unexpected from a show in which people and 
animals coexist, have sex and use drugs.
“30 Rock,” “Theme from ‘30 Rock’” by Jeff Richmond
Comedy theme songs love their horns, and “30 Rock” is no 
exception. The theme to this “SNL”-based sitcom is rushed and 
upbeat, as though New York City has been turned into sheet music. 
The unmistakable rise and fall of the baritone sax works its way 
through the hectic background of the drums. Anyone that’s ever 
walked outside 30 Rockefeller Plaza or worked in entertainment 
knows exactly the sentiment being conveyed: Everything is chaotic 
and a disaster, but hey, at least we’re having fun.
“Game of Thrones,” “‘Game of Thrones’ Theme” by Ramin 
Djawadi
Yes, the show is overrated, but the music definitely isn’t. The 
intense orchestral intro to “GOT” sounds both modern yet fitting to 
the medieval setting to the series. The battling of string instruments 
that start low and eventually crescendo is able to 
represent many aspects of the show without saying a 
word. The listener can feel the battle raging between 
dark and light, good and evil. There is a sense of 
urgency to the sound that brings the viewer through 
a journey before the first scene. If you’re not about the 
gore and assault that this show is rooted in, at least 
watch the first two minutes for some good music.
“Mad Men,” “A Beautiful Mine” by RJD2
Just as comedies love horns, dramas love strings. 
Set in the ’60s, “Mad Men” could have easily picked 
a jazzy piece from the era, but they went a different 
way. While Beck was originally contracted to make 
a theme, the singer dropped out due to little faith in 
the success of the show. After hearing this RJD2 song 
on NPR, show creator Matthew Weiner scratched the 
words and edited the instrumentals to get the theme 
song for his showpiece. The suspenseful strings in 
the beginning suggest danger is near, and when the 
drums come in it’s as if someone’s running to get 
away. The song is sexy, polished and mildly unsettling 
— everything you would get if you took starring actors 
Jon Hamm and John Slattery and turned them into a 
composition.

Lyricless theme songs, featuring orchestras ... also horns

B-SIDE: TV NOTEBOOK

HBO

Canadian-born violinist Lara St. John made 
headlines this past July when The Philadelphia 
Inquirer published a 5,000 word exposé detailing 
St. John’s allegations of sexual abuse against former 
Curtis School of Music faculty member Jascha 
Brodsky. The article also contained allegations that St. 
John had told Curtis administrators of this abuse, first 
in 1986 and more recently in a letter she wrote to the 
school’s president in 2013.
The Daily spoke to St. John by telephone about the 
#MeToo movement, classical music, her allegations of 
abuse and others that have rocked this industry. 
The Daily: How do you think the #MeToo 
movement has affected classical music as a whole?
St. John: I think pretty strongly in the past two 
and a half years. It started with Levine and then there 
were some other conductors like (Charles Dutoit) and 
then William Preucil in Cleveland. I came out with my 
allegations against my teacher in Curtis. I don’t think 
I would ever have been listened to back then. And I 
probably would have been blacklisted … I’m sure it still 
happens but hopefully those would-be perpetrators 
are shaking in their boots at this point.
TMD: Your allegations spoke to institutional 
culpability that extended a lot beyond one person. 
How has the structure of the industry 
at large dealt with this?
St. John: I don’t think the 
institutions have been dealing well 
with it. I think every school is hoping 
that this will just go away, that 
we’ll just forget about it. It’s like the 
anonymous commenters that are just 
like, “Get on with it. Go on with your 
life.” And it’s just like, “No!”
TMD: How have people who 
don’t have an institutional tie and 
don’t have a reason to be scared been 
responding to you?
St. John: I sort of became a hotline 
this past summer. I heard from a lot of 
people for a couple of months. People 
are afraid because it’s their livelihood 
and if they do come out with their 
name, it’s still possible that presenters 
or orchestral representatives will 
blacklist them. People will say to me, 
“Look I’ll talk to you but it has to be 
off the record.” Of course I won’t ever 
out them but it’s really upsetting. It 
shouldn’t have to be that way. That’s 
what I want to change and that’s what 
hasn’t ever changed.
If you look at Placido Domingo, for 
example, who was one of the latest 
who was accused of harassment 
— everyone’s known that. It was 
an open secret. But only two of the 
many women came out with their 
own name. It was something like 10 
percent of (the women) came out with 
their name and it hurt the other 90 
percent.
The Daily: You came forward so 
publicly with this allegation and you 
refused to stop speaking about it. How 
has your role in the industry evolved?
St. John: People talk to me a lot, 

which is why I am working on a documentary about 
this. I feel like people will speak to me long before 
they will speak to some interviewer like you or Katie 
Couric or one of those people. It’s an understanding 
that I have that maybe the average person doesn’t 
have.
I have yet to see what’s going to happen. It’s 
totally probable that there’s going to be some dude 
in Kentucky that doesn’t want to hire me because I 
said this or that, but in that case I don’t want to work 
with someone who won’t work with me because I was 
raped as a child.
The Daily: Right.
St. John: (Laughing) And I shouldn’t have said 
Kentucky! I mean any place, of course.
The Daily: If you look back ten years and then 
come back to the present, what has changed over the 
past ten years? Do you think institutions have made 
changes?
St. John: There’s no question that these institutions 
wouldn’t have changed without the pressure of the press 
… Without sunlight as the disinfectant nothing would 
have changed. They would keep trying to pretend that 
nothing happened. And I think that people are less and 
less willing to allow that to happen. 
And this is not to say that only women are abused 
by their teachers, but women have had a lot more 
recognition in the past ten years. And as women get more 
chances these things start to change. You see a lot more 
women composers being recorded, 
being performed. Women conductors 
are (becoming more common) as well. 
It’s not great but it’s a start. And it’s 
much, much better than it was ten years 
ago. 
The Daily: And here we’ve had the 
allegations against David Daniels and 
Stephen Shipps and we’re in the same 
state as Larry Nassar. How do you think 
education has been affected by this too?
St. John: I know when I was a kid 
there was this mentality, especially 
in music, that your teacher is God. I 
think it’s changing now, especially 
because a lot more teachers are women, 
especially in the violin world. If you 
look at Curtis right now, for example, 
(many) of the teachers are women. And 
none of the teachers think “in order 
to teach you I need to break you down 
psychologically.” 
I’m hoping that, given what’s come 
out in the past two years, it will scare 
potential perpetrators from doing these 
things. And windows in doors — I mean 
how hard is it to put windows in doors? 
These are simple steps that need to be 
taken.
The Daily: And what do you see 
going forward? If this movement were 
to continue to evolve, how do you hope it 
would?
St. John: In music … we start so young. 
It’s all one-on-one and it’s so intense and 
it’s so much practice from such a young 
age. It’s so ripe for abuse. I just hope we 
can keep future 14-year-olds from having 
this happen to them. And if it does happen 
— when it does happen — they won’t be 
ignored, and mocked, for what someone 
did to them. I want people to be listened 
to and I want people to be believed. 

The evolution of #MeToo

SAMMY SUSSMAN
Daily Arts Writer

Hip hop is the most popular genre in the country 
right now (when lumped together with sister genre 
R&B). YouTube data geek Data Is Beautiful shows 
hip hop and R&B becoming most popular around 
’08 or ’09 by measure of record sales; Nielsen 
places its ascendancy at 2017, with hip hop and 
R&B dominating in sales, charting and Grammy 
nominations. Either way, by most measures, hip 
hop has become the genre of the nation in the 2010s 
— and the decade’s ruling rapper has never been 
clearer.
The meteoric rise of a decade-defining rapper
Even though he got his beginnings in ’04 under 
the moniker K-Dot, Compton-based Kendrick 
Lamar wasn’t on anybody’s radar until Overly 
Dedicated in 2010. The little-known mixtape earned 
Kendrick a spot in XXL’s 2011 Freshman Class, an 
accolade that meant a lot more back then than it 
does now. His first independent album Section.80, 
like Overly Dedicated, remained low-key outside of 
Los Angeles and hip-hop circles. Still, Section.80 
was acclaimed for its dark and thought-provoking 
lyricism. While others, inspired by West Coast 
legends like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, wore their 
Compton background like a brand of toughness, 
Kendrick used his experience to develop a socially 
aware message.
At the end of 2012, good kid, m.A.A.d. city was a 
hurricane in hip hop. Kendrick’s debut studio album 
sparked heated online arguments about the concept 
of an “instant” or “modern” classic. Storytelling was 
already Kendrick’s greatest strength, but he amped 
it up to the max for one of hip hop’s most cinematic 
albums of all time. Every music journalist made it 
their mission to explain what a “concept” album 
was and why GKMC was the greatest one of all 
time. By the time To Pimp A Butterfly dropped in 
2015, Kendrick was one of rap’s most universally 
acclaimed emcees, the holy hip-hop prophet. 
Few albums have combined so much artistic 
experimentation and conscious, clever songwriting 
while remaining smooth and accessible. President 
Obama himself deemed “How Much A Dollar Cost” 
his favorite song of 2015.
Since then, Kendrick has been eating Grammy 
awards and Platinum certifications like candy. 
Somehow untitled unmastered., a compilation album 
of TPAB demos, sounds better than most records 
from 2016, even without any unifying theme or 
message. DAMN. in 2017 was a little more divisive 
among hip-hop superfans, but critics and the 
mainstream rallied behind it for album of the year. It 
even won a Pulitzer Prize. Masterminding the hype 
of Black Panther: The Album in 2018 was just icing 
on the cake of Kendrick’s decade of domination. He 
didn’t need to release another album in 2019; there 
was no rapper who could do anything in 2019 to 
make a difference to the record. If Kendrick hadn’t 
sealed the deal halfway through the decade with 
TPAB, then DAMN. put the nail in the coffin.
What makes for a “decade-defining” rapper?
My gut instinct is to say that when you think of hip 
hop in the 2010s, the recording artist that naturally 
comes to mind is the one who defines that decade. 
But that’s who defines your decade in hip hop. Who 
defines the decade? Some point at the numbers: 
Kendrick has numerous awards and sales accolades 
and chart positions, all the stuff that only kind of 

matters. But that has little to do with his dominance.
Not much of Kendrick’s work has shown direct 
influence in terms of the type of music that’s coming 
out. That’s something we’ll probably see in the next 
10 or 20 years. But there is something to be said for 
the way every move Kendrick makes creates an 
earthquake in hip hop. Like when his aggressive 
throne-claiming verse on Big Sean’s “Control” 
sparked an enormous backlash. Or when his 
chorus, “We gon’ be alright,” was adopted by police 
brutality protesters to show solidarity in the Black 
community.
What really made Kendrick the king of the ’10s 
is simple: Prolificity, consistency and quality. In 
10 years he’s had two masterpieces and four other 
amazing albums. His versatility has led to songs 
that are dense, layered works of art while remaining 
accessible in the mainstream (see “Swimming 
Pools”). And his writing is some of the most thought-
provoking across all genres of music, whether it’s 
intricate metaphorical storytelling or gripping lines 
that could be broken down and analyzed for days on 
end. My personal favorite: “If a flower bloomed in a 
dark room, would you trust it?”
No real competition
The strongest defense for Kendrick as the rapper 
of the decade really comes in just two words: Who 
else?
Looking specifically at the 2010s, the competition 
immediately slims down. Kanye West and Lil 
Wayne have arguments for the 2000s, but not the 
2010s. Many rappers that started to gain traction 
in the beginning of the decade haven’t been as 
consistent or maintained their relevance, like Big 
Sean or A$AP Rocky. So who does that leave? Who 
first started to pick up steam in 2010, and has had 
an enormous impact going into 2020?
Tyler, the Creator is one of the first to come to 
mind, especially in terms of influence. His work 
with Odd Future has already done so much for hip 
hop — there’s no BROCKHAMPTON without Odd 
Future. I don’t think his pre-Flower Boy material is 
near good enough for him to qualify, though.
One of the few artists who has enjoyed as much 
mainstream popularity over the decade as Kendrick 
Lamar is J. Cole. He’s also similarly celebrated by 
his peers. That’s where the argument for Cole ends, 
though. Among hip-hop fans, his fame has always 
been divisive — so divisive that it wouldn’t be fair 
to consider him.
That only leaves one real competitor. Someone 
who first rose to prominence this decade and stuck 
in the popular consciousness ever since. Whose 
influence on hip hop can be seen far and wide. A 
pop culture icon of the decade: Drake.
This is the closest call to make, and the only real 
threat to Kendrick’s title. Drake came up in the 2010s, 
he has popularity and influence that transcends 
Kendrick Lamar, he is easily the best-selling rapper 
of the decade and has numerous awards and records. 
But there is one thing that really holds him back.
When you stack the best Drake album — If You’re 
Reading This It’s Too Late or Take Care — against the 
worst Kendrick Lamar album — DAMN. or Black 
Panther: The Album — there’s a very fair argument 
to be made that Kendrick’s worst is better than 
Drake’s best. I think about what will stand the test 
of time. What will be a celebrated classic, and what 
will become a relic. I don’t know if Drake will be a 
relic or a celebrated classic of the 2010s. Kendrick 
Lamar though — he will never be a relic, and he will 
certainly be a celebrated classic.

The Daily 
spoke to 
St. John by 
telephone 
about the 
#MeToo 
movement, 
classical 
music, her 
allegations 
of abuse 
and others 
that have 
rocked this 
industry.


Each year, the quality of content released to the 
public from the entertainment industry hits new 
highs and lows. With every sequel and prequel 
released, I sink further into doubt that Hollywood 
can surprise us anymore. After all, what can shake 
audiences to their core the way that “Arrival of a 
Train” did? Or the “firsts” of every genre? Thankfully, 
something always comes along that proves me 
wrong, and after all these years that Hollywood has 
gifted me with pleasant surprises and whirlwinds 
of emotion, it would be an absolute shame if I didn’t 
take a moment to thank the shows that shifted my 
perspective on the industry and society as a whole. 
I’ve been blessed by the entertainment industry a 
countless number of times, but the most memorable 
gift was my introduction to the depths and bounds 
that animated shows can reach in their content, 
spirit and artistry. People have a tendency to 
associate animation with children, failing to realize 
how animation allows creators to push boundaries 
with more flexibility and ease. When you start 
to realize just how far they can go, it completely 
changes the way you view television.
My proper introduction to a good animated show 
was “Avatar: The Last Airbender” in the basement 
of my childhood home. My memories of it are 
hazy — it was long ago when the show was still on 
Netflix. As someone who grew up on Disney and 
Nickelodeon sitcoms, it was rare to see a normalized 
version of Asian culture in a mainstream television 
series. There’s still an ongoing debate as to whether 
“Avatar” counts as anime — if it does, the show blows 
my whole article wide open. So let’s say it doesn’t. 
As a Nickelodeon-produced show, “Avatar” displays 
astonishing layers of cultural sensitivity and 
inclusion 
with 
tact and ease. It 
quickly became 
my 
personal 
standard 
for 
what 
I 
can 
expect from a 
good 
animated 
series, and few 
animated shows 
over time have 
been 
able 
to 
stand 
beside 
or 
surpass 
its 
predecent.
The first to do 
it was “Bojack 
Horseman.” 

Anyone who knows me has likely been pestered to 
watch the show several times, and those who I can 
force to get past the first season never regret it. At 
its best, it’s a surprise. Like most first time watchers, 
I began the series with a halfhearted effort. 
Even though I had been told it was better than 
it appeared, good shows aren’t appreciated until 
they’re lived and experienced. I had subconsciously 
categorized it under the expectation that it would be 
a jaunty, vulgar adult cartoon like the rest, and while 
it starts that way, it finds its footing and maintains 
its excellence throughout its nearly-concluded 
six season run. Its existentialism is gradual, and 
the depths it reaches are wholly unexpected but 
entirely welcome. The creators somehow made 
this animated anthropomorphic horse such a 
heartbreaking yet alarmingly relatable character, 
not to mention the other side characters, each of 
whom have complex, three-dimensional features 
that the majority of secondary television characters 
lack. It’s extremely predictable of me to stamp this 
as the best animated show of the decade, but I can’t 
help it. There aren’t many shows that’ll make you 
feel the same way that this one does, and it’ll draw 
out any buried existential dread that you might 
have hoped to get rid of by early adulthood. 
But that’s not to say that there are only two good 
animated television shows out there. This decade 
had much to offer in the realm of animation and 
its various art styles, which advanced quickly 
throughout the decade. 2019 alone has had amazing 
animated shows start, end and get cancelled by 
cruel shifts in streaming and entertainment. A 
notable mention is “Undone,” a show by the same 
creator as “Bojack.” It’s a quick eight episodes on 
Amazon Prime Video, and breaks barriers of genre 
like I’ve never seen before. Its run is too recent to 
label as the best animated series of the decade, but 
it’s a beacon of hope for those who fear that the new 
decade will have 
nothing to offer 
but terror and 
moral 
panic. 
Apart from some 
select 
real-life 
issues we might 
have to face head 
on in the very 
near future, at 
least we can be 
soothed in the 
fact that good 
television is out 
there, and likely 
won’t be going 
away for some 
time.

‘Bojack’ is bright, always

In her 1992 book “Men, Women, and Chainsaws,” 
Carol J. Clover coined the term ‘Final Girl,’ referring 
to female leads in horror movies who survive as 
the other characters are killed off. Carol writes 
that they “shriek, run, flinch, jump or fall … (and) 
sustain injury and mutilation” until they escape or, 
infrequently, kill the attacker themselves. Clover 
explains that they are less people and more “abject 
terror personified,” existing solely to be afraid. 
The tormented female protagonist has existed 
almost as long as horror has, with ‘Scream Queens’ 
like Ann Darrow in 1933’s “King Kong” shrieking 
their way through the plot, a stereotype that 
transformed into the ‘Final Girl’ through the 
decades. The concept coalesced in the 1970s, with 
characters like Laurie in “Halloween” being hunted 
by powerful villains like Michael Myers. While 
they do fight back, every ‘Final Girl’ spends most of 
their stories terrified, trying to escape the villain. 
This lasted until the new millennium, when cinema 
began to embrace new ideas and voices.
In 1999’s “Scream,” Sydney is still a ‘Final Girl’ but 
violently fights with almost no fear when compared 
to Laurie from “Halloween,” and even terrifies 
her attackers. Then there is Sarah in 2005’s “The 
Descent,” who hits another character with a pickaxe, 
leaving them for the monsters so she can escape with 
her own life. A weirder example is 2006’s “Inland 
Empire,” where Laura Dern (“Blue Velvet”) plays 
both the hero and villain, and it is sometimes unclear 
who is who. 
While the roles of ‘Final Girl’ and villain were still 
obvious in these movies, the inhumanity stretched 
to both. In the 21st century, The ‘Final Girl’ didn’t 
just flee the monsters blindly. She made ambiguous, 
brutal choices that ran against the ‘Scream Queen’ 
stereotype. In the 2000s, the ‘Final Girls’ strained 
the trope’s limits, with a horrific action here or a 
murky decision there. In the 2010s, however, they 
transformed entirely.
In 2014’s “Under The Skin,” an alien stalks the 
streets of Scotland, abducting humans for food. 
While this seems like the perfect set up for an “alien 
terrorizes Final Girl” scenario, like 1979’s “Alien,” the 
extraterrestrial instead takes the form of a woman 
played by Scarlett Johansson (“Marriage Story”) and 

does not fit the typical role of the antagonist. This 
time, the alien is the main character. The female 
protagonist in “Under the Skin” is no ‘Final Girl,’ 
though. She is intelligent, powerful and unafraid. 
She murders people but develops shades of kindness, 
creating an empathetic push and pull that’s 
impossible with simple heroes and villains.
While the alien is chased by an assailant in the 
final minutes of the film, it’s by an average man, 
not a monster like the usual ‘Final Girl’ adversaries. 
After being assaulted by said man, the alien sheds 
their female skin and stares into its human eyes. 
An alien, a creature usually depicted as a monster 
in horror, holds the skin of an assaulted woman, a 
trait that typifies the ‘Final Girl,’ as if contemplating, 
why wear the skin if it only brings terror and injury? 
Subsequent characters chose not to.
In 2015, Thomasin in “The Witch” survives as her 
family is killed off, but, ultimately, doesn’t fight back 
or even run from the witches. She joins them. 2018’s 
“Suspiria” is similar: Susie triumphantly becomes 
the leader of a sinister witch coven in 1970s Berlin. 
Like “Under The Skin,” these women break the 
‘Final Girl’ mold and become something far more 
complicated.
They are attacked by horrific forces and fight back, 
but don’t do it out of fright; their violence is imbued 
with deep power. They also embrace violence and 
the supernatural, without being confined to the role 
of a villain.
Without the ‘Final Girl’ trope, horror can tread 
new ground, forcing audiences to empathize with 
dark, complex characters and examine their own 
capacity for evil. 
What happens after losing one’s humanity? Can 
violence be healing and redemptive? Can one escape 
the patriarchy by joining a coven of witches? 
These questions, and many more, could be asked 
only by discarding the ‘Final Girl’ stereotype, and 
are mostly unique to the 2010s. In no other genre, 
and at no other time, have the roles of hero and 
villain converged in this way, to such profound and 
horrific effect. 
In 2018’s “Halloween,” everything comes full 
circle. Laurie and Michael Myers return, and the 
ending is shot to mirror the original. Yet it’s Myers 
that hides, as Laurie hunts for him with a shotgun. 
She is ferocious in a way that approaches that of a 
serial killer, like Myers. It may have taken almost 
half a century, but Laurie finally isn’t afraid.

After recently being added to the Subtle Depressed People 
Traits group on Facebook, I enjoyed laughing in my room 
late at night, scrolling from a macabre Winne the Pooh joke 
about mental illness to a self-deprecating tweet complaining 
about being lonely but never leaving the house. These are 
the jokes for the generation of kids who are trying to cope. 
The past decade saw a rise in mental illness and mental 
health awareness in schools and in my own life. I was 
officially diagnosed with anxiety and depression in early 
2016. At first, I was embarrassed about the stigma, worried 
that others would not want to associate with someone so 
unstable. Going into college, I felt like I had “ANXIETY 
AND DEPRESSION WATCH OUT” scrawled in black 
Sharpie on my forehead. However, the more I opened up 
to others, I found that many students were struggling with 
what I was. 
Generation Z, those born from 1997 onward (according 
to the Pew Research Center), has grown up amid the 
divisive politics, mass shootings, sexual harassment and 
climate change of the 2010s. The American Psychological 
Association’s October 2018 study “Stress in America: 
Generation Z” wrote, “America’s youngest adults are most 
likely of all generations to report poor mental health, and 
Gen Z is also significantly more likely to seek professional 
help for mental health issues.” 
The APA survey found that a major stressor for 
Generation Z was gun violence caused by mass shootings 
and school shootings. By the time the Pulse (2016), Las 
Vegas (2017) and Parkland (2018) mass shootings had 
happened, our generation grew anxious of the reality 
that it could happen at any of the malls, high schools or 
concerts that we were attending. The panic over continued 
mass shootings opened up a conversation about gun 
control, followed by the backlash for politicizing a tragedy, 
ultimately burying the discussion of gun laws until the next 
mass shooting. The resilience of Gen Z activists like Emma 
Gonzalez and David Hogg, survivors of the Parkland school 
shooting, sparked the March for Our Lives movement 
and a national conversation. A few days after the Walmart 
shooting in El Paso, I remember being on the second floor 
of a Target and wondering how I would escape if there was 
a shooter. It is this kind of anxiety that proliferates around 

our generation. 
While politics in America were forever changed in the 
2016 elections, Gen Z-ers continued to charge through 
childhood and adolescence surrounded by the white noise 
of this divisive political era. The normalization of acts like 
deportation and family separation has led our generation to 
become almost numb to the news cycles and Twitter battles. 
The #MeToo movement opened up an entire system of 
sexual harassment and oppression of the powerless by the 
those in power, unveiling the systemic levels of silence and 
cover-up, a rude awakinging for young women espeically. I 
hope I can speak for most college students when I say I can 
remember holding my breath during the Christine Blasey 
Ford and Brett Kavanaugh hearings. It felt like “he said” 
would eventually trump “she said,” and it was enraging to 
witness. 
All the while, climate change’s detrimental effects 
continue to escalate to unprecedented levels by 
anthropogenic causes, like air and water pollution. Even with 
the overwhelming support and evidence from the scientific 
community, leaders within our country and around the 
world continue to ignore how pressing and dire our climate 
crisis is. Another Gen Z activist, Greta Thunberg, is leading 
the charge and inspiring Generation Z and others to become 
more vocal and steadfast in fighting for our beliefs.
Generation Z is known for their mental health, but 
maybe our identity stems from more than just increasing 
levels of anxiety about our changing world. I believe it also 
displays our generation’s ability to show vulnerability about 
our anxieties and the effects they bring, leading to mental 
health awareness popping up as a conversation topic and, 
sometimes, outright theme at college events and high school 
pep rallies. 
A Wall Street Journal article this past May stated 
that companies are now implementing mental health 
seminars and protocols for their employees in the wake 
of Gen Z’s enterance into the workforce. The rise of stress 
management apps and programs is just the start of the major 
de-stigmatization of mental illness and the embracing of the 
importance of mental health in overall well-being. 
When a tumultuous world called, Generation Z bit back 
with internet culture blended with creative genius and 
a sharp sense of humor. We are the generation that cuts 
darkness with humor and wit, attempting to diffuse the 
tension and fear, to allow ourselves to bond over shared 
anxieties and feel less alone in these chaotic times. 

Love, an anxious generation

The stories all follow the same general outline: 
A girl lives her whole life thinking her society is 
normal. She prepares for the day when she is old 
enough to be be categorized by a system prescribed 
by her society. She meets a boy. She begins to 
realize something is off with the world she lives in, 
that maybe it isn’t as perfect as she thought it was. 
She discovers the truth and she and the boy lead a 
reformatory revolution. Split that story up into three 
young adult novels, and you have the “Divergent” 
series by Veronica Roth. Or the “Delirium” series 
by Lauren Oliver. Or the “Matched” series by Ally 
Condie, or the “Uglies” series by Scott Westerfield, 
or a variant of “The Hunger Games” or any of the 
young adult female-led trilogies that hit stores and 
teenagers between the years of 2010 and 2015. This 
literary phenomenon was mostly ignored (as most 
young adult fiction is) by older generations. But the 
weird Millennial-Gen Z mashup generation that 
went to middle school in the early 2010s received 
the full brunt of its force. Dystopian novels took 
bookstores and middle schools by storm, and even 
self-professed seventh-grade literary snobs (like 
my past self) could not ignore the love. 
This specific breed of young adult fiction had a 
remarkable ability to hold the attention spans of 
tween and teenage readers, even in a period when 
this age group was, for the most part, getting their 
first smartphones. Something made them magnetic, 
even after reading was no longer considered “cool.” 
These series achieved the effect in two ways: They 
organize their stories into a series format, which 
kept readers reading, and they employ just enough 
plot twists to keep the reader engaged without 
feeling tricked. Their prose is simple, usually in 
the first person, and involves more action than 
description, which is perfect for a book written 
for a mass of thirteen-year-olds. Furthering their 
popularity, series like “Divergent” and “The 
Hunger Games” were turned into movies with 
attractive leading actors and aggressive marketing 
teams. 
Much of the tension in these novels stems 
from governmental restriction and control. In 
“Matched,” the government controls who you 
love; in “Delirium,” the government controls 
whether you can love at all; in “Divergent,” the 
government controls your behavioral traits (which 
determines who you love), and so on. Almost every 
young adult has problems with some form of 
authority figure. These novels paint these figures 
in an overwhelmingly negative light, but family and 
guardians often remain relatively unscathed. The 
family, in fact, is usually a source of support and 
an object of devotion and love. Even when it seems 
like parents are the “bad guys,” setting boundaries 
and enforcing curfews, novels from this specific 
subgenre remind the reader that they have our 

best interests at heart. Perhaps this comes from 
the writers themselves being parents — they are 
more inclined to show characters that are most like 
themselves in the most positive light possible, even 
in a story where they are writing from a 16-year-
old’s point of view. 
The dystopian novels of the 2010s take the 
universal fears and frustrations of young adults and 
cloak them in science fiction and dramatic action. 
Middle school is a constant battle to fit in and find 
out who you are. It’s probably the first time you had 
a real crush on someone else. These books, with 
their categorizations and romantic subplots, frame 
these problems not as inconsequential — how most 
middle schoolers are told — but instead as absolutely 
crucial. In the same way a sixth grader might 
be choosing which table to sit at for lunch, Tris 
chooses which faction she will call her new home. 
Young teenagers do not need fiction to solve their 
problems — people of this age have been having 
the same issues, in one form or another, for a very 
long time. Instead, young adult readers simply need 
fiction to validate their emotions in a world that tells 
them those very emotions are superfluous. Looking 
back, a sixth grade crush or choice of dress for the 
eighth grade formal seems utterly insignificant. But 
at the time, it feels like the decision of a lifetime. 
Middle school years are defined by big emotions 
attributed to little things: Being melodramatic and 
crying because a paper fortune teller told you your 
crush would never like you back is an integral part 
of being a young adult. The role of these dystopian 
novels, then, is to give readers a space in which they 
can fully experience those emotions without being 
condescended for their “unimportance.”
At their core, all these series rely on the idea that 
human nature cannot be categorized, no matter 
how hard humans try. The evil authoritarian 
societies try to confine human nature to one aspect. 
In the beginning, before the main character and 
the reader uncover the sinister underbelly of the 
particular society, this seems perfect. After all, 
categorization makes things so much simpler: 
Imagine a world without all the messy emotions and 
trial-and-error of trying to find yourself. Life would 
be much more straightforward if we all knew our 
explicit, definite role in society — where, exactly, 
we fit in. It would be nice if we all knew exactly 
where we belonged by our early teens, but these 
books gave our middle school selves the answer we 
didn’t really want to hear: That easy categorization 
might seem like utopia, but is actually just a 
gross oversimplification of human nature. This 
dystopian literary phenomenon, though perhaps 
unoriginal and overly romanticized, validated the 
larger existential and emotional frustrations our 
generation experienced at the time of their peak 
popularity.

B-SIDE: TV/FILM CROSSOVER

Comedians Tina Fey and Amy Poehler began their 
night as hosts of the 2015 Golden Globes with a joke 
that would define popular media in the 2010s: “Only at 
the Golden Globes do the beautiful people of film rub 
shoulders with the rat-faced people of television.” 
This line, while intended to poke fun at the persistent 
belief that film is a higher and more prestigious art 
form than television, actually exposes a recent trend 
that has made this belief obsolete. The Golden Globes 
aren’t the only place where faces from both film and 
TV cross paths; in fact, the worlds of the two mediums 
have become so enmeshed that the distinction between 
movie star and TV actor is no longer clear-cut. 
In a decade where streaming services like Netflix 
and Hulu dominate cable television, the idea that TV 
has no artistic value has faded away almost entirely. 
When sitcoms and procedurals were the most popular 
shows on television, it was easy to say that the medium 
may not be as impactful or meaningful as cinema. 
However, with billions of dollars spent every year on 
original content for streaming services, television has 
evolved far beyond its small-time roots. 
While bitingly funny, Fey and Poehler’s suggestion 
that the worlds of film and TV are overlapping fails to 
acknowledge that, in the past ten years, these worlds 
have become nearly identical. Rather than pushing 
“serious” actors to film, renowned television series 
have pulled top-billed names into the TV industry 
and made the careers of countless new stars. With 
the stigma towards TV as a lower-budget medium 
effectively erased, talent has sprawled across its native 
platforms. 
In fact, the Golden Globes are the perfect 
representation of how the film and TV industries have 
intersected. The award show, which has categories for 
film and TV productions, has seen steady ratings in a 
time where more niche award shows like the Emmys 
and the Oscars have experienced a significant decrease 
in ratings over the past few years. The Golden Globes 
have also been lauded for their commitment to coming 
through on promises of diversity on-screen and 
on-stage.

The blurring of lines between TV and film has 
opened doors for new stars and new representation that 
was previously unseen in the nearly all-white films and 
shows before the 2010s. While minorities and women 
are still underrepresented in pop culture, the push for 
more varied stories and faces to tell those stories has 
intensely affected both industries. By acknowledging 
the growing similarities between the forms of media, 
the quality of TV shows and films has responded to 
the other’s respective success with more thought for 
the consumer. As the demand for representation has 
increased, each platform has raced to make that goal 
a reality.
While there is still much work to be done in 
improving the entertainment industry as a whole, it is 
undeniable that the reactions of TV and film producers 
will be similar. With content and public interest 
becoming more closely aligned, the two formats will 
continue to merge as reflections of the calls for social 
change in popular media. Soon, it won’t be just the 
Golden Globes where TV and film are in the same room 
together. It’ll be in every aspect of their production and 
use.
— Anya Soller, Daily Arts Writer
In sum: The 2010s have been a decade of convergence 
for television and movies. “Movies,” here, means 
specifically the Scorsese-would-spit-on-their-graves 
type, all the “Potters”, and Marvels, and “Star Wars” 
and “Jurassic Parks.” The “television” I’m referencing 
is not the latest CBS sitcom — not “God Friended Me,” 
not “Man with a Plan.”
The convergence of movies and television has 
been brought on by that other class of TV, those 
script-driven-dramas that aim to rise to a higher 
artistic occasion, reckoning themselves serious and 
important, and receiving crucial praise that would 
validate them as such. High-brow television has, as 
Richard Brody put it in his recent New Yorker article 
on the 27 best movies of the decade, taken the place of 
the “so-called mid-range drama for adults,” filling the 
niche in entertainment for script-driven narratives, 
often “(subtracting out any) discernable directorial 
originality or inventiveness.”
At the same time, movies have stolen a core tenet of 
the television show: the serialization. Every single one 
of the top twenty movies in the box office this decade, 
as well as the most profitable film from each year 
this decade (minus 2014’s ticket-stub crown going to 

“American Sniper”), has been a remake or a franchise 
film. If it’s true that there’s been a resurgence of box 
office numbers, if it’s true that people are getting back 
to the theaters, it’s cinematic, extended universes and 
nostalgia trips that are putting butts into seats.
The decade-long period that 
started in the mid-2000s and ran 
through the middle of the 2010s, 
often called the Golden Age of 
Television, was headlined by 
television shows that aimed to 
reach past what was narratively 
expected of them, working with 
literary aspirations, even, in some 
cases. As Adam Wilson noted in 
his reflective essay in Harper’s on 
the many Golden Ages of television 
earlier this fall, critics aren’t 
afraid to pass around the idea of 
the visual medium as a literary 
one, pulling a quote from writer 
Brett Martin, who called “The 
Wire” “one of the greatest literary 
accomplishments of the early 
twenty-first century.” If you ask 
the average, avid fan of television, 
you’ll hear that it’s TV, not cinema, 
that’s taken the seat as the rightful 
artistic heir to the novel, the play, 
the poetic epic — not that there 
needs to be a successor, not that it 
was necessarily going to be cinema 
in the first place.
What does it say that the evolution of each of these 
forms — of television and of movies — seems to have 
come at the hands of the other? More so in the past 
decade than ever before, industry creativity and talent 
has been pumped into prestige dramatic television, 
with every studio, cable channel and streaming service 
looking for their spiritual successor to “The Sopranos” 
and “The Wire.” Just so, we’ve seen Hollywood rear its 
ugly (and obviously profit-driven) head — the advent 
of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the sequel-

storm that followed, making explicitly clear what 
the industry values: Selling tickets at any cost, even if 
that means the end product tends toward unoriginal, 
repetitive, increasingly vapid. Hollywood’s major 
model to this end has been to franchise everything, 
to jam anything they can into a 
cinematic, extended, multi-movie 
universe. All of a sudden, the slate 
at your local multi-plex begins to 
resemble the schedule of a cable 
television channel. Installment 
after installment after installment 
of stories that seem like they’ll 
never advance, nevermind end.

Throughout 
this 
decade, 
streaming services like Netflix, 
Hulu and Amazon Prime have 
further blurred the line between 
television and film, releasing 
Oscar-contending 
features 
directly onto laptops and living 
room televisions, a type of direct, 
front-facing 
access 
with 
the 
content that used to be reserved for 
TV. Big name directors like Noah 
Baumbach, Alfonso Cuarón, Bong 
Joon Ho and Martin Scorsese 
have turned to Netflix to make 
movies, in many cases bypassing a 
theatrical release wholesale.
Just a few weeks ago, the 
Department of Justice released a statement declaring 
that they would be terminating the Supreme Court 
decision from 1948 which broke up vertical integration 
— the monopolies that studios like Paramount had — in 
the entertainment industry. The historic Paramount 
decision prohibited studios from owning their own 
theaters, creating competition by ensuring that each 
local theater, maybe the only one in a city or region, 
wasn’t showing movies made by only one company. 
The timing of the DOJ’s decision comes with more 
than a hint of irony.

The crossover of the decade: 2020 in film and television

As we move into 
the next decade, 
I can’t help but 
believe that 
cinema — in the 
Scorsese-would-
NOT-spit-on-
their-graves sense 
— will be further 
banished from 
the studio system.

B-SIDE: TV NOTEBOOK

Ranking television shows is an impossible task, one that’s only gotten more difficult 
as there are fewer and fewer shows that everyone watches. There is little difference 
between number five and number three, so I am opting to chronologically rank them 
instead. Binge-watching television shows, as opposed to viewing them week-to-week, 
makes it harder to recall the details as you don’t have any time to process. As we near the 
end of the decade, here is a list of the shows no one should forget.
5. “30 Rock” (2006-2013)
Available on Hulu
138 Episodes
Bizarre, hilarious and witty. Loosely based on Tina Fey’s experience as a head writer 

for “Saturday Night Live,” “30 Rock” follows Fey’s character, Liz Lemon, as the head 
writer and showrunner of the NBC sketch comedy show “TGS with Tracy Jordan.” 
She supervises the cast and crew, which includes her best friend Jenna Maroney (Jane 
Krakowski, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”), the difficult-to-manage Tracy Jordan 
(Tracy Morgan, “Green Eggs and Ham”) and network executive Jack Donaghy (Alec 
Baldwin, “Saturday Night Live”). Episodes often feature arguments between Donaghy’s 
conservative views against Lemon’s liberal ones, Maroney’s attempts to become a film 
star, Jordan’s poor behavior and their romantic and personal lives. It is extremely 
reflexive, making jokes about NBC and even satirizing Comcast’s acquisition of it.
4. “The Office” (2005-2013)
Available on Netflix
201 Episodes
Based on the British show of the same name, “The Office” is a mockumentary-style 
sitcom that depicts the everyday lives of office employees in Scranton, Pennsylvania at 
the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. It employs a huge ensemble cast, most 
notably Steve Carell as Michael Scott, the well-intentioned yet often misunderstood 
regional manager who frequently ends up annoying his employees. The first season 
was met with mixed reviews but was followed by several seasons of critical acclaim. 
Although the final two seasons did not feature Carell (resulting in a large dip in quality), 
the show will always be remembered for being one of the first comedies in the United 
States without a laugh track to have solid ratings. There may never be a character like 
Michael Scott on television again, so get your last couple re-watches through because 
the show is heading to NBC’s own streaming platform in January of 2021. Until then, 
“The Office” remains Netflix’s most streamed show.
3. “Parks and Recreation” (2009-2015)
Available on Netflix
125 Episodes
“Parks and Rec” is often compared to “The Office,” and people will get in heated 
debates about which show is better (I am, personally, Team Leslie). This mockumentary-
style political satire sitcom stars Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, the deputy director of the 
Parks and Recreation Department in the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana alongside 
her best friend Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones, “Angie Tribeca”). Additionally, it features a 
strong supporting cast that includes Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza and Chris 
Pratt.

Laugh, TV is funny

B-SIDE: COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

I come from a family of five: a brother, a sister and two moms. 
“Two moms” is an interesting way to express the different and 
historically complicated relationship of being raised by a lesbian 
couple, though “two moms” is how I have always described my 
family situation. This is often followed by “oh, you have a step-
mom.” Nope. “Your dad remarried?” Wrong again. “Then were 
you adopted?” Sperm donor.
It took some time before I was able to comprehend why my 
situation was so confusing. To be raised by an openly gay couple 
is rare. Alix, the co-writer of this piece, is the first person I have 
ever met who shares this experience. Rare experiences make for 
interesting writing, and I am happy to share as we reminisce on 
the decade and the legalization of gay marriage that came with 
it.
One question I often receive, as a heterosexual male, is what 
it was like to be void of fatherly influence in my upbringing. My 
response to this, for the majority of my life was, “Well, I have 
uncles and grandfathers,” which is a response I regret to have 
ever given out. The question itself is problematic, for what is 
fatherly influence? Is it knowing how to play football? My mother 
taught me how to throw a tight spiral. Is it having some older 
representative of male anatomy? My parents are both physicians 
— they know more about male anatomy than most dads.
I call my brother my brother and my sister my sister even 
though we share no genetic connection. I call them my brother 
and my sister because we grew up together, under the same roof, 
calling the same people our parents. I call both my parents mom, 
because that is who they have always been to me and my siblings.
This is not in defense of gay marriage, because we have 
nothing to be defensive of. My family and I lack anything to be 
sorry for, we bear no burdens for having lived the way we always 
have. Gay marriage should have never have had to be legalized, 
because it never should have been illegal in the first place. I 
was provided a safe home, a childhood I am fond of, a space for 
creativity and freedom of ideas. My lesbian parents raised three 
children and did a fine job doing so. We are all healthy, in a good 
state of mind, with goals and aspirations: I’m not sure what else 
a straight family could provide.
For years, I was silent at school about our family situation, 
especially since my siblings and I grew up in a fairly conservative 
area. After the legalization of gay marriage, it felt as though 
there was some national recognition of our family after years of 
rejection and fear of exile.
The legalization of gay marriage meant a great deal for my 
family, though it was more symbolic of national and political 
acceptance. My parents had been together for over twenty years 
and had raised three children before their partnership was 
legally recognized. In this sense, the act was more an affirmation 
than a permission slip, but it was celebrated nonetheless.
In 2015, my mother proposed to my other mother at our family 
home, despite already having been together for twenty years. 
There are many stories like my parents’ because the legalization 
was a chance to renew an already solid partnership, in a bond 
familiar to those who had disavowed them for millennia.
— Zachary M.S. Waarala, Daily Arts Writer 
***
Growing up with lesbian moms meant that there was a routine 
of phrases I had plenty of practice saying. “Yes, I really have four 
moms.” “No, they are not in a polygamous relationship.” “No, 
I’m not adopted, I had a sperm donor.” “No, I don’t really care 
to meet him.” The list goes on. I’ve told the story of my familial 
life so often, I could say it in my sleep. My parents are lesbians. 
When I was three they separated and each met new partners. 
My two lesbian mothers multiplied into four and boom, I have 
four moms.

When I was in third grade, I came up with nicknames for 
all of them in order to make conversations about my moms less 
confusing when I was talking with my friends. The nicknames 
stuck and now, whenever I talk about my moms I refer to them 
as “Broken Ankle Mom” (because she had a broken ankle at the 
time), “Police Mom” (because she is a policewoman), “Taco Bell 
Mom” (she used to work at Taco Bell) and British Mom (she’s 
British).
Growing up, my familial life never seemed out of the ordinary. 
Even though there was only one other kid in my town who had 
gay parents, I didn’t feel any different. I grew up in a pretty 
conservative area, yet nobody made fun of me. At least, not to my 
face. I’m sure they might’ve said some things behind my back. In 
fact, one time in high school, a football player whispered to me, “I 
know your secret … your parents are gay.” Which I found pretty 
hilarious at the time (and still do).
The only thing I found weird was that before June 26, 2015, 
my parents were never married. My birth mother and my British 
mom were together for ten years before they separated. If they 
could have legally gotten married, they would have. Sure, all of my 
mothers acknowledged that marriage wasn’t a defining factor of 
their love. Yet, the numerous legal issues that came along with not 
being allowed to marry was quite frustrating. I remember once, 
when my Birtish mom was hospitalized, the hospital did not allow 
my policewoman mom to visit her during “family only hours.” She 
had to sit outside in the waiting room, unable to stand beside the 
love of her life during what was quite a traumatic experience. In 
the eyes of the law, they were just two women who lived together. 
It was because of this that I so desperately wanted gay marriage 
to be legalized. In fact, I even wrote a letter to President Obama 
asking him to make it legal. I still have the “letter” he wrote back 
to me framed in my childhood bedroom, complete with the ever-
personal phrase, “Dear Student of America.”
The day gay marriage was finally legalized was a visceral 
experience. I was on my first ever date with a girl when I heard 
the news. We were at the local zoo and my phone exploded with 
texts from all of my moms. I came home from my date to the 
rainbow flag flying outside of our house. Our family had always 
been valid to us, but now we were seen as valid in the eyes of our 
country. The five remaining years of the 2010s were complete 
with both sets of mothers tying the knot with one another. 
While the love between 
my 
parents 
was 
omnipresent during the 
first half of the decade, 
it was the legalization 
of gay marriage that 
made the latter half of 
the decade something 
to celebrate.
After gay marriage 
was legalized, there 
was a sense of hope 
that both Zach’s and 
my family shared. A 
hope for the future. 
A hope that families 
like ours wouldn’t feel 
the insecurity we felt. 
Because there is no 
reason to feel insecure. 
Families 
like 
Zach’s 
and mine have love at 
their core, just as other 
families do. Love that 
has always existed and 
will continue to exist, 
regardless of what any 
law could ever say.

While there’s no cut-and-dry definition of the best film of the 
decade, some measures are better than others. For me, a decade-
defining movie must be more than technically, critically or 
commercially successful. Many films from the 2010s met all of 
these criteria, all competent, some more memorable than others. 
After all, even the most holistic and unambiguous appreciation is no 
guarantee that the product will persist in our collective conscious 
for years to come.
So what makes the difference then? What sets apart the 
momentarily 
great from the 
transcendent? 
In 
a 
word, 
dynamism. How 
can 
art, 
film 
or 
otherwise, 
define its time 
unless it pulls 
off a magic trick 
of transforming 
and 
warping 
right 
before 
our very eyes? 
For a film to 
say 
something 
meaningful 
about its era is 
one thing. To 
still 
have 
an 
incessant voice, 
a 
stamp 
on 
culture several 
years 
after 
its release, is 
another 
thing 
entirely.
With that broad metric in mind, there is a clear winner here. 
It might not even be a close contest — the best movie of the 
decade is David Fincher’s “The Social Network.” As both a wildly 
entertaining tragedy of deteriorating friendships and a diagnosis on 
the impending future of technological communication, “The Social 
Network” perfectly straddles the line between watchability and 
cultural dynamism in a way that no other film from the decade does.
Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin once admitted, “I’ve heard of 
Facebook, in the same way I’ve heard of a carburetor. But if I opened 
the hood of my car I wouldn’t know how to find it.” This information 
is important; Sorkin explicitly distinguishes his story from reality. 
Not once do the words “Based on a true story” appear across the 
screen. Yet that fact is what makes the film so compelling as an 
artifact of this decade. What Sorkin intended as a human drama 
with Facebook in its periphery ultimately speaks for itself about 
the woes, dangers and evils of the tech conglomerates that rule 
our lives. In this way, “The Social Network” is an unintentionally 
oracular statement more than it is a testament to Sorkin’s predictive 
instincts.
“Gretchen, they’re best friends.”
The collaboration of Fincher and Sorkin is perplexing on its 
surface — Sorkin is most concerned about the depth of his content 
where Fincher prefers a focus on structure and tone. Sorkin’s 
characters are snappy and shrewd where Fincher’s are idiosyncratic 
and futile. And yet the marriage of their work manages not only to 
retain the best qualities of both, but also adds synergy to them. 
Fincher is notorious for being a rigid perfectionist, so Sorkin’s 
esoteric, game-theoretic dialogue plays out with striking clarity. 
“But you’re going to go through life thinking that girls don’t like you 
because you are a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of 
my heart, that that won’t be true. It’ll be because you’re an asshole,” 
Rooney Mara’s (“A Ghost Story”) Erica Albright hisses at the end of 

the first scene. And the precision of those words stings.
Moreover, Fincher’s attention to immaculate set design and 
tendency 
toward 
claustrophobically 
immersive 
camerawork 
never falters. In particular, the Henley 
Royal Regatta race is an adrenaline shot 
of a scene, depicting the athletes as vivid, 
imperfect figures amid blurry, dreamlike 
scenery. While every other scene in the film 
is essentially a conversation, Fincher never 
misses an opportunity to let his characters’ 
violent undertones rudely shift the camera, or 
their positions in the frame tell us something 
new. It’s an easy movie to direct with obvious 
choices. 
But 
Fincher’s direction 
takes 
more 
than 
enough 
risks 
to 
impress.
“What sound is 
he making? Is that 
like a tsk?”
A 
scrawny 
college 
student 
with 
a 
backpack 
and a hoodie is 
sprinting 
across 
campus. He weaves 
through 
arches 
and 
alleyways, 
a 
shortcut 
here, 
a 
sidestep 
there. 
His humility is present; several trios 
of piano notes that seem to float and 
hover in your ears. His rage is palpable 
too — it’s a sinister, soul-shaking hum in 
the background. Together, these sonic 
textures communicate the tender darkness 
of Mark Zuckerberg. I’ve studied to Trent 
Reznor and Atticus Ross’s Oscar-winning 
score more than I’ve studied to anything else. It is a thrumming 
electronic abyss peppered with deeply comforting melodies. The 
industrial-techno beat of “In Motion” is followed promptly by the 
squeaking grittiness of “A Familiar 
Taste.” Hopeful chords can exist, 
if only for a fleeting moment, taken 
over by dissonance. Our characters 
chase their ambitions and only 
falter when those ambitions incite 
sour consequences. Dreams can 
reach only so far, long enough 
until that droning buzzy emptiness 
subsumes all, until friendships are 
only burdens.
While Reznor and Ross have 
identified a style to their score 
compositions, they are probably 
better known for their work in 
Nine Inch Nails. But what I find 
most remarkable about the movie’s 
score is how little of a departure 
it actually is from the industrial 
rock band. Reznor is no stranger to 
writing depraved, lonely music. He 
has an uncanny ability to affirm one 
while dragging them further into 
his dark orbit. And that quality is 
precisely how he gives the score its 
lasting edge. Sometimes, we are all 
the kid behind the computer, fingers clacking furiously away into 
the void.
“We don’t know what it is yet.”
“The Social Network” imagines the beginnings of Facebook as 

a youthful, enterprising endeavor. “The Facebook is cool,” Justin 
Timberlake’s (“Inside Llewyn Davis”) Sean Parker says. “You don’t 
want to ruin it with ads because ads aren’t cool.” And for all the 
things that the real life 
Facebook has become since 
the movie’s release, “cool” 
and “ad-free” are certainly 
not accurate descriptors. 
In 
Sorkin’s 
optimistic 
imagination, the company 
was created by people who 
didn’t understand what it 
was. If anything, reality 
has affirmed this narrative; 
only 
since 
the 
Brexit 
vote and the Cambridge 
Analytica scandal has the 
world woken up to the 
actual extent of political 
and social power the site 
has.
Actual 
events 
affect 
how 
we 
rewatch 
the 
film, but interaction goes 
both 
ways. 
Watching 
Jesse 
Eisenberg’s 
(“The 
Hummingbird 
Project”) 
real-life counterpart and 
his blabbering testimony on 
Capitol Hill is fascinating. 
He carries all the high-
strung, geeky energy, but without the ease or the nonchalance of 
the character. He in every way has become the worst version of a 
lonesome coder who got dumped in a bar; more accurately, lonesome 
coder with his tendrils in control of global communication. It doesn’t 
matter that Facebook wasn’t started over a breakup at a Harvard 
bar. Whether we like it or not, Jesse Eisenberg’s performance has 
irreversibly shaped our perception of one of the biggest figures in 
tech today.
***
What better way for this decade to end then for Sorkin himself to 
pen a New York Times opinion lambasting Mark Zuckerberg? “The 
Social Network” 
is a movie that 
has dramatically 
changed 
since 
its 
release. 
Its 
interaction 
with 
culture 
is 
a 
conversation, not 
a statement. How 
its 
impact 
will 
shift in the future 
is impossible to 
tell, so we need to 
keep watching it.
But the actual 
experience 
of 
watching it isn’t 
boring, or a chore. 
It’s a delightful 
example 
of 
talented 
craftspeople 
working 
at 
the 
peak 
of 
their 
respective 
potentials. 
Our 
need for communication will never end. And, unfortunately, the 
deluge of creepy hacker tech figures might not either. “The Social 
Network” is a half-open window into the kind of loneliness that 
drives our desire to stay connected with each other.

Sorry! My Prada’s at the cleaners: “The Social Network”

ANISH TAMHANEY
Daily Arts Writer

Bro-country, a word that sends shivers down the spines of genre 
traditionalists, brings smiles to the faces of millions of loyal listeners and 
sounds like money to industry insiders. Coined in 2013 by Jody Rosen in 
New York Magazine, he pins down the subgenre as being “music by and of 
the tatted, gym-
toned, 
party-
hearty American 
white 
dude.” 
Whether 
you 
like it or not, this 
character 
(and 
his 
infatuation 
with trucks, beer 
and girls) defines 
the past decade 
of 
mainstream 
country 
music. 
Popular 
but 
polarizing, 
it’s 
worth 
acknowledging 
the best, or at 
least the most 
memorable, 
bro-country 
hits of the 2010s 
— if not for 
sentimentality’s 
sake, 
than 
to 
help us figure 
out 
where 
mainstream 
country music is 
headed in 2020.
“Dirt Road Anthem” was recorded twice before it became the highest-
selling record by a solo male country artist, so it’s significant that its success 
came with Jason Aldean. It was a glimpse into the future. In 2011, a rap-
influenced country song had never broken into the mainstream before, that is 
until the mash-up was endorsed by Aldean, an already established artist. The 
popularity of “Dirt Road Anthem” offered just an inkling of the potential that 
its kind of sound and shallow themes might hold when given the opportunity 
to reach a bigger audience. Soon enough, everyone was trying to rap about 

“cornbread and biscuits.” 
“Baby you a song / You make me wanna roll my windows down / and 
cruise.” In the summer of 2013, with an added verse from Nelly, “Cruise” 
by Florida Georgia Line was inescapable. And let’s be honest, the hook is 
probably in your head right now. But what is it even about? Literally, it’s about 
getting a girl to ride in your truck with you. But really, as the first country song 
to ever go diamond, it’s about country songs not needing to be about anything. 
That’s key. If the genre’s best-selling song was a heartfelt, acoustic story-song, 
then that’s what country radio would have been playing the past few years. 
But it wasn’t. Instead, we have hundreds of “long, tanned legs” copycats. 
Later that year, Zac Brown infamously called this song “the worst song 
(he’s) ever heard” and for good reason: “That’s My Kinda Night” by Luke 
Bryan can sound painfully cringe-y. “Little Conway a little T-Pain / Might just 
make it rain,” Bryan croons, which feels more like a threat than a welcome 
suggestion. If that wasn’t bad enough, an auto-tuned voice echoes the “make 
it rain” verse unironically. But as hard as it is to admit, I like it. I understand the 
song’s appeal. It’s insanely catchy, and, for a young woman from the suburbs, 
it’s fun to play pretend, to embody the swagger of a cocky, hypermasculine 
bro, if only for three minutes. 
“It’s gettin’ kinda cold in these painted on cut off jeans” Maddie & Tae 
sigh on their refreshing first single, giving country listeners a much-needed 
reality check. Even though 
“Girl In a Country Song,” 
released in 2014, is anti-
bro-country, it absolutely is 
worth acknowledging as it 
proves that bro-country’s 
domination was met with 
some pushback from fellow 
artists. The song takes the 
perspective of the one-
dimensional props used in 
all of the songs mentioned 
above, the girl, and finds out 
that being the bro’s muse isn’t 
as fun as they make it sound. 
It’s chock full of references 
to the songs it got played 
alongside on the radio, but 
twists their lyrics into funny 
one-liners to prove a point. 
“Can I put on some real 
clothes now?” they wonder. 
Although the song hit #1 and 
got the duo plenty of interviews, bro-country continued answering no.
After bashing Bryan’s hip hop-infused country, Zac Brown decided to 

give the style a try himself on his 2016 album Jekyll + Hyde. “Beautiful Drug” 
is one of its standouts, exemplary of the way country can blend with EDM 
relatively seamlessly. It’s a glossy, highly produced, extended metaphor with 
a beat drop as irresistible as Brown finds his love interest. Because of Brown’s 
initial resistance to this kind of genre-bending, the song’s existence also 
demonstrates the overwhelming wave of experimentation country started 
going through in the latter half of the decade, something that sprouted from 
bro-country. If Zac Brown got on board, rest assured nearly everyone else in 
mainstream country music did too. 
Released in 2017, “Body Like a Back Road” is “Dirt Road Anthem” 2.0 
which makes the genre’s dramatic evolution all the more evident. Unlike 
Aldean, Sam Hunt is open about his rapping influences. Instead of real drums, 
Hunt opts to rhyme against a snap track. And the narrative itself is different. 
The singer no longer meets the girl on the dirt road — in Hunt’s version, her 
agency has been cut down to the point that she is the dirt road. Hunt’s style 
had already struck up a conversation about the boundaries of country music, 
what’s borrowing and what’s appropriating, but ultimately the success of the 
song pushes all of those questions aside. “Body Like a Back Road” and Hunt 
himself suggest that anything can be country, so long as that’s what the artist 
calls themself. 
Throughout the past 10 years, country radio has been playing women 
less 
and 
less, 
bringing in sounds 
and 
artists 
from 
different 
genres 
more and more, and 
finding new ways to 
compare women to 
inanimate objects. 
But it wasn’t all bad.
As 
Kacey 
Musgraves 
gets 
recognized for her 
instrumentally rich 
and witty style and 
traditional-leaning 
and Luke Combs 
starts to dominate 
the 
charts, 
it’s 
clear 
that 
the 
genre is preparing 
to 
start 
a 
new 
chapter. The 2010s 
raised 
questions 
fundamental to the essence of what country music is. For better or for worse, 
the next decade holds the answers.
