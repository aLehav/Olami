Every time Business senior 
Mia Heard walks into class, she 
is the only Black person in the 
room.
“When I walk in a room, I 
don’t get the luxury of being 
like, ‘Oh, I’m just a person 
walking to class,’” Heard said. 
“It’s like, I’m the Black girl 
walking into this class, and I 
can just feel the pressure of just 
being that Black girl; the black 
dot that always has to be there 
or they know I’m gone.”
According to the Office of 
the Registrar, for the winter 
semester of 2019, 2 percent 
of students in the Stephen M. 
Ross School of Business at the 
University of Michigan were 
Black, 6 percent were hispanic 
and 57 percent were white. In 
addition, 62 percent of students 
were male and 38 percent were 
female. 
These demographics are not 
unnoticed by the entirety of the 
Business School. To improve 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
efforts, students and faculty 
developed the DEI Task Force 
during the winter of 2018. Part 
of the Bachelor of Business 
Administration Council, the 
Business 
School’s 
student 
government, 
the 
taskforce 

hosts events and initiatives 
to 
develop 
an 
inclusive 
environment for students. 
Though parts of the Business 
School have been working to 
improve DEI efforts, some say 
the lack of a race and ethnicity 
course 
requirement 
in 
the 
Business School, paired with 
the lack of communication 
between administration and 
students, has impeded the 
growth of diversity in the 
Business 
school. 
Opposing 
views from students on the 
Identity 
and 
Diversity 
in 
Organizations workshops in 
the school has also been an 
obstacle, according to some 
students. 
“I literally felt like a slave 
in that instance, because I 
felt like I was begging people 
to buy me”
In one of her group projects 
for class, Business senior Elsa 
Ramesh, head of the Inclusive 
Classroom Committee for the 
DEI taskforce, said a student 
made transphobic and racist 
comments while other students 
laughed along. She said the 
students 
present, 
including 
herself, did not speak up about 
the incident to avoid upsetting 
their peers. They worried it 
could impact their grades, 
Ramesh said.

As of Sept. 27, the University of 
Michigan has spent $1.6 million 
defending against a lawsuit alleging 
its policies violate the due process 
rights of those accused of sexual 
misconduct, MLive reported at the 
beginning of October. 
When asked by The Daily, 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick 
Fitzgerald clarified costs incurred 
by the Doe v. University of Michigan 
lawsuit are not drawn from tuition 
money and state appropriations. 
Instead, Fitzgerald explained, the 

University’s legal fees are covered 
by its insurer, Veritas Insurance 
Corporation, which the University 
owns. 
A report in 2017 found higher 
education institutions around the 
nation spend an average of $350,000 
on sexual misconduct lawsuits. To 
explain the significantly higher cost 
of the Doe v. University of Michigan 
lawsuit, Fitzgerald pointed to the 
amount of legal work required in 
the “3-year-old, heavily litigated 
case involving complicated legal 
issues.”
“The plaintiff filed an initial 
complaint, an amended complaint, 

and second amended complaint, 
the latter of which is 40 pages 
long and contains more than 
200 paragraphs of allegations,” 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email. 
“There has been a total of 64 briefs 
in the trial court, with 38 filed by 
the plaintiff, resulting in a record 
that exceeds 5,000 pages. There 
have been five lengthy hearings and 
four status conferences in the trial 
court, as well as full briefing and 
oral arguments in the Sixth Circuit 
Court of Appeals.”
However, 
Deborah 
Gordon, 
the 
attorney 
representing 
the 
anonymous 
plaintiff, 
pushed 

back 
against 
the 
University’s 
explanation. According to Gordon, 
$1.6 million is an “incredible” sum 
of money to spend on a case not 
involving discovery of evidence. 
Instead, she blamed the cost on the 
University’s legal briefings. 
“I’m a four-person law firm, I 
do contingency fee work mostly,” 
Gordon told The Daily. “At one point 
they had 12 different attorneys 
working for them from three 
different law firms, two of them out-
of-state … I’m a very small firm and 
they’re saying it’s me that caused 
this? That’s laughable.” 

The 
Search 
Advisory 
Committee for a new Vice 
President 
of 
Student 
Life, 
appointed by the University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel, held the first of two 
town hall meetings Monday 
evening. Around 20 students 
and 
community 
members 
attended the event which was 
intended to gauge specific 
areas 
of 
student 
interest 
when selecting a shortlist of 
candidates to recommend to 
Schlissel. E. Royster Harper, 

the current Vice President 
of Student Life, will retire in 
January.
The town hall, which was 
held in a question and answer 
format, gave an opportunity for 
the committee to hear student 
opinions 
about 
the 
vision, 
experience and values they 
want the new vice president to 
uphold. Students at the meeting 
also expressed a desire for 
more one-on-one interaction 
between communities of color 
and the VP of Student Life. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Ronnie 
Alvarez said he hopes for a 

candidate who will listen to and 
understand different cultures, 
specifically 
mentioning 
the 
Latinx community. 
“I think someone who has 
culture 
empathy 
and 
has 
experience working with the 
Latinx community would be a 
quality that’ll be a good fit for 
the new VP,” Alvarez said. 
The committee addressed 
questions about ensuring the 
pool of candidates was diverse, 
how different cultural voices 
would be heard and how 
decisions would be made with 
a student-centric focus.

Alec Gallimore, the Search 
Advisory 
Committee 
Chair 
and Dean of the College of 
Engineering, reflected on the 
importance of student opinion 
in the search for the new VP.
“We knew this person has to 
be student-focused in a big way, 
and the town hall reinforced 
it,” 
Gallimore 
said. 
“It 
is 
important to hear the diverse 
points of view that represent 
where our students are coming 
from.”

The 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court 
overturned 
a 
ruling 
Monday 
morning that would have caused 
almost three dozen Michigan 
congressional 
and 
legislative 
districts to be redrawn on account 
of the districts unfairly helping 
one political party.
The 34 Michigan districts under 
examination by the Court included 
15 state house, 10 state senate and 
nine congressional districts.
Multiple Democratic plaintiffs 
along 
with 
the 
League 
of 
Women 
Voters 
first 
brought 
the case to attention, and a 
panel including three federal 
judges 
in 
April, 
saying 
the 
districts were unconstitutionally 
gerrymandered. The group gave 
the state a deadline of Aug. 1 to 
redraw the district lines in time 
for the 2020 election or the court 
would do it for them.
The panel then released a 
146-page 
opinion 
which 
said 
the 
boundaries 
enacted 
by 
Republicans following the 2010 
census either filled districts with 
Democratic 
voters 
or 
spread 
out their own voters in other 
districts in a way in which was 
unconstitutional.

Ann Arbor’s frequent sporting, 
academic and cultural events 
draw in large numbers of tourists, 
creating an expansive market 
for short-term rentals through 
platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. 
But, in light of Ann Arbor’s lack of 
affordable housing crisis and the 
threat to the hospitality industry, 
city officials are considering 
regulating 
short-term 
rental 
companies.
There are currently 978 Airbnb 
listings in Ann Arbor, and over 
300 of these are for an entire 
home — whether it is a house or 
one bedroom apartment. This 
means there are 300+ less homes 
available for people who want to 
live in Ann Arbor.
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Councilmember 
Elizabeth 
Nelson told The Daily she is 
concerned about how short-term 
rentals are affecting Ann Arbor’s 
housing market.
“If people are going to advocate 
strongly to city council that we 
need to build new housing, those 
same people should be every bit 
as concerned about the housing 
that we are losing to short term 
rental,” Nelson said.

Ann Arbor City Council 
convened Monday evening 
to 
discuss 
a 
range 
of 
policy topics ranging from 
municipal 
staffing 
levels 
to permit fees for medical 
marijuana facilities. 
The 
council 
discussed 
CA-4, 
a 
resolution 
to 
increase the amount of full-
time city employees. The 
resolution would increase 
the 
budget 
to 
include 
funding 
for 
new 
staff 
members, 
which 
caused 
discussion 
across 
the 
council. 
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, 
I-Ward 
2, 
discussed how she believed 
adding 
another 
full-

time city employee was 
unwise from a budgetary 
standpoint. 
“For 
fiscal 
year 
20, 
we 
added 
14 
full-time 
employees 
to 
the 
city 
budget, and over the last 
three years, we’ve added 30 
FTEs,” Lumm said. “That is 
a huge number...It roughly 
represents 
three 
million 
dollars a year additionally…
Adding FTEs during the 
year and outside of the 
budget 
process 
is 
poor 
budget discipline at any 
point during the year, and 
it’s especially poor process 
when we’re three and a half 
months into the fiscal year.”
Lumm went on to discuss 
how seeing the budget as 
a flexible document is a 
bad habit for the council to 

cultivate. 
“We rarely used to do 
it, now it seems we do it 
frequently,” 
Lumm 
said. 
“Instead of a firm, binding 
document, 
the 
budget 
has become a suggested 
starting point that council 
just adds to during the year. 
Emergencies are one thing, 
but adding resources for 
normal business activities 
this soon into the fiscal 
year is not the kind of fiscal 
responsibility I believe we 
need to maintain.”
Councilmember 
Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1, agreed 
with 
Lumm’s 
concerns 
about 
budget 
flexibility. 
He also argued that city 
residents didn’t specifically 
indicate a desire for these 
new positions. 
“We reach out to 
these communities and 
we ask them, ‘Would 
you want us to lower 
your 
revenues 
next 
year or do you want 
more service?” Hayner 
said. “They say they 
want 
more 
service. 
That’s 
great, 
and 
I 
think that’s great that 
the city is going to 
provide that service...
But I’m not so sure 
they knew that they 
were going to get a 
sustainability person.”
Overall, the motion 
carried, authorizing an 
increase in community 
service staffing. 
The 
council 
went 
on to discuss a new 
permit fee for medical 
marijuana 
facilities. 
The ordinance would 
establish 
an 
initial 
$5000 fee for suppliers 
of medical marijuana 
when 
obtaining 
a 
permit, 
and 
a 
subsequent 
yearly 
$5000 renewal fee. 

Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 
5, 
discussed 
how 
this 
provision was a part of 
the process of legalizing 
recreational marijuana use, 
and expressed his desire for 
the fees to fund programs 
targeting social injustice. 
“I 
sponsored 
the 
ordinance 
allowing 
recreational 
marijuana 
to take effect November 
1st, this is just protocol 
in allowing that to follow 
through,” 
Ramlawi 
said. 
“The fees that are associated 
with 
the 
permitting 
process will go back into 
administering the program, 
I just hope that future fee 
that we collect give us the 
latitude to put money into 
social programs associated 
with the social ills and 
social injustice that come 
along in everybody’s life.”
Hayner 
expressed 
concern 
with 
the 
high 
fees, citing they may act 
as barriers to entry in 
the market for supplying 
medical marijuana.
“There’s 
some 
equity 
issues 
with 
these 
fees,” 
Hayner said. “That seems 
for small business owners to 
me, five grand just to ask for 
a permit and then five grand 
to renew it…it just seems 
like a large amount.”
He went on to express 
concern that the fees were 
unfairly 
high, 
and 
did 
not provide an equivalent 
benefit to permit-holders.
“Does this not have to 
be commensurate with the 
service provided?” Hayner 
said. “What is it that we are 
doing for that five thousand 
dollars?” 
The 
motion 
passed, 
authorizing the permit fees 
for suppliers of medical 
marijuana.

The lawsuit Doe v. University 
of Michigan was first filed 
in 
June 
2018 
by 
a 
male 
undergraduate student, referred 
to in the lawsuit as “John Doe.” 
It arises from a complaint filed 
by a female student against Doe 
in the University’s Office of 
Institutional Equity, claiming 
Doe sexually assaulted her. 
At the time, the University’s 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy 
operated 
under 
the 
single-
investigator 
model, 
which 
involved 
one 
investigator 
who had conversations with 
the accuser, the accused and 
witnesses, without opportunity 
for parties to confront one 
another. 
Doe 
claims 
this 
procedure 
violated 
his 
due 
process rights and amounted to 
gender discrimination against 
male students accused of sexual 
assault. 
In the lawsuit, Doe denied the 
female student’s allegations and 
said he was not made aware of 
them when he was interviewed 
by the OIE investigator, leaving 
him unable to fully respond to 
the accusations against him. 
In addition, the University put 
Doe’s official transcript and 
degree on hold following the 
complaint, which the lawsuit 
argued 
put 
Doe’s 
academic 
and professional future at risk 
without full investigation. Doe’s 
transcript was released soon 
after the lawsuit was filed.
Three months later, the U.S. 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals 
struck down the University’s 
single-investigator model in Doe 
v. Baum, a separate lawsuit filed 
by Gordon against the University. 
The 
ruling 
required 
the 
University’s sexual misconduct 
policy to grant students accused 
of sexual misconduct the option 
of a live hearing and cross-
examination. 
The 
University 
tried 
to 
appeal 
the 
ruling, 
arguing 
cross-examination discourages 
those who have been sexually 
assaulted from reporting and 
disadvantages 
lower 
income 
students who cannot afford legal 
counsel. The Sixth Circuit Court 
declined to re-hear the appeal, 
forcing the University to release 
a new interim sexual assault 
policy in December 2018 that 
included cross-examination and 
a live hearing. 
In 
June, 
a 
week 
before 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
was 
prepared 
to 
appear in U.S. District Court 
for a private, off-the-record 
settlement 
conference, 
the 
University filed a motion to 
dismiss the lawsuit, contending 
the due process argument was 
no longer relevant because of 
changes in the new policy. 
U.S. District Judge Arthur 
Tarnow opened the conference 
to the public and to the media 
two days before it was scheduled 
to occur. Sixteen hours before the 
planned conference, the Sixth 
Circuit Court granted a request 
by the University to postpone 
the meeting, a move criticized 
by Tarnow. In August, the Sixth 
Circuit Court ruled that Schlissel 
did not have to appear in court 
for the settlement conference, 
determining 
Tarnow 
had 
overstepped his discretion by 
requiring so. 
The University maintains the 
ongoing lawsuit is irrelevant 
now that the sexual misconduct 
policy requires a live hearing 
and 
cross-examination 
and 
already meets the ruling of 
Doe v. Baum. However, Gordon 
explained she is still pursuing 
the lawsuit because she wants to 
obtain relief for her client, which 
includes clearing his permanent 
record. 
Ultimately, she said she wants 
the District Court to issue an 
order requiring the University 
to have a live hearing and cross-
examination to further ensure 
the University will maintain 
these due process procedures. 
Gordon explained the ruling in 
Doe v. Baum is a court opinion, 
which only allows the University 
to be sued. If there were a court 
order and the University changed 
its policy, it would be in contempt 
of court, which imposes further 
punishment. 
“It’s like a University rule 
you could think of it … Unless 
there’s somebody that sends 
you disciplinary action, the rule 
doesn’t really mean as much,” 
Gordon said. “You just know 
you’re not supposed to violate it, 
until you get a directive saying if 

you do violate it you’re out.”
Gordon said she believes the 
University should address sexual 
misconduct by providing the 
option of a live hearing and cross-
examination as it does all other 
cases of student misconduct. 
She disparaged the Start by 
Believing campaign, a program 
the 
University’s 
Division 
of 
Public Safety and Security has 
signed 
onto, 
that 
nationally 
works to change the way sexual 
misconduct is responded to.
“They 
think 
student-to-
student sexual misconduct is not 
like other misconduct. Why is 
that, I don’t know,” Gordon said. 
“I guess it’s because they want to 
be politically correct, they like 
the ‘Start by Believing campaign,’ 
which is the antithesis of due 
process … But our whole system 
of justice is based upon the 
concept 
(of) 
innocent 
until 
proven guilty.”
In November 2018, Secretary 
of 
Education 
Betsy 
DeVos 
proposed 
new 
regulations 
for Title IX — the federal law 
preventing sex discrimation in 
federally-funded 
universities 
often raised in discussions about 
sexual assault — that would 
allow for cross-examination of 
victims. Some have lauded the 
move as a necessary to ensuring 
due process rights of the accused. 
However, students at the 
University 
and 
activists 
against sexual assault across 
the nation have criticized the 
use of cross-examination in 
cases of sexual misconduct, 
arguing 
it 
re-traumatizes 
victims and thus discourages 
reporting. In addition, some 
scholars suggest the practice is 
actually counterproductive to 
truth-finding as it encourages 
manipulation and intimidation. 
Lawyers 
and 
Title 
IX 
professionals also worry cross-
examination will push colleges 
to facilitate courtroom-esque 
hearings they may not have the 
capacity to take on. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Emma 
Sandberg 
is 
the 
founding 
member and executive director 
of the non-profit Roe v. Rape, 
which works to help survivors 
of sexual violence heal through 
activism and prevent sexual 
misconduct through education. 
She explained she believes cases 
of sexual assault should be 
handled differently from other 
cases of misconduct because the 
former can often be very personal 
and is especially traumatizing. 
Sandberg also noted only 
5 percent of campus sexual 
assaults are reported to the 
University and only 2 percent 
of sexual assault accusations 
nationally are false. However, 
Sandberg said she knows several 
students who didn’t report or 
who dropped their case because 
of 
the 
cross-examination 
requirement. 
“The 
amount 
of 
students 
who would be falsely accused 
at the University is just so low 
compared to the amount of 
survivors who are prevented 
from both getting justice and 
ensuring 
they 
feel 
safe 
at 
school,” Sandberg said. “When 
a perpetrator is off the hook, it 
puts all the rest of the students in 
danger.”
When asked about concerns 
surrounding cross-examination, 
Gordon pointed to resolution 
of 
sexual 
assault 
cases 
in 
the criminal justice system. 
According to Gordon, students 
who protest cross-examination 
by bringing up the trauma it can 
cause are “extremely immature,” 
“short-sighted,” and “focused 
only on themselves.”
“Rape victims that don’t go to 
the University of Michigan don’t 
have these special protections, 
and still the system somehow 
works, more or less,” Gordon 
said. “There’s nothing unique 
about being a college student 
that should give you more 
protection than anybody else … 
I realize they’re college students, 
and so maybe they’re just not 
thinking of the bigger picture, 
but lawyers are. To me, it just 
seems 
really 
straightforward 
situation. Whatever pain you feel 
and trauma is unfortunate, but 
it doesn’t trump throwing aside 
our justice system.”
The University has received 
criticism for implementing cross-
examination in its sexual assault 
policy. However, in a previous 
Daily article, LSA junior Sidney 
Aloisi, co-coordinator at the 
Sexual Assault and Prevention 
Awareness Center, noted some 
may not realize the University 
did not voluntarily require a live 
hearing and cross-examination.

“I think that a lot of people 
have the misconception that 
it 
was 
Michigan’s 
decision 
completely and that’s what we 
wanted, but that is a myth I am 
happy to debunk,” Aloisi told 
The Daily in October. “It wasn’t 
our decision … We didn’t really 
have a say in the hearing, and 
it’s something that we’ve tried 
and tried again to get the Sixth 
Circuit Court to reconsider, but 
repeatedly they will not.”
Many remain unsatisfied with 
this explanation. Though the 
Doe v. Baum decision requires 
cross-examination 
in 
sexual 
misconduct 
cases, 
it 
allows 
the option for representatives 
to do the questioning, yet the 
University’s policy requires the 
accuser and accused to cross-
examine one another. 
In January, Sandberg created 
a petition — which has over 
78,000 signatures at the date 
of publication — calling for 
the University to allow cross-
examination by a third-party 
adviser instead. Last month, the 
American Civil Liberties Union, 
at Sandberg’s request, released 
a public letter calling for the 
University to change its policy. 
In response to these concerns, 
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen 
previously 
told 
The Daily the University does 
not allow for a third-party 
representative to conduct cross-
examinations for equity reasons.
“Questioning 
by 
personal 
advisors — often attorneys — 
is not allowed at U-M out of 
concern that not all students 
would be able to afford counsel,” 
Broekhuizen said. 
However, both Sandberg and 
Gordon agreed the University 
should pay for legal counsel if a 
student, either the accused or the 
accuser, would like a lawyer but 
cannot afford it. Gordon noted 
she would be willing to represent 
these cases pro-bono for both 
sides and conjectured many 
other lawyers would feel the 
same. She accused the University 
of intentionally preventing third-
party representatives to provide 
justification for fighting the 
Sixth Circuit ruling.
“I personally think they’re 
doing that on purpose to make 
this more traumatizing so they 
can they were right all along,” 
Gordon said.
Sandberg 
conjectured 
the 
University refuses to change its 
policy to discourage reporting.
“The conclusion I have reached 
is that they chose this cross-
examination model because they 
want fewer students reporting,” 
Sandberg said. “They want less 
perpetrators suing them, and 
it’s about money. I find this very 
concerning, that administrators 
seem to be valuing the school’s 
money 
over 
the 
emotional 
wellbeing of survivors.”
In messages to the University 
community, 
Schlissel 
has 
emphasized 
the 
University’s 
hopes 
to 
increase 
rates 
of 
reporting. In support of this 
claim, the administration has 
pointed to the implementation of 
the adaptable resolution pathway 
to handle sexual misconduct 
cases without a live hearing or 
cross-examination. 
The 
University 
recently 
released two reports on trends 
of sexual misconduct on campus. 
The Campus Climate Survey 
found a decrease in sexual 
assault rates overall since 2015 
and an increase of trust in 
the University’s investigation 
process, and the DPSS report 
showed the number of on-campus 
sexual 
assault 
reports 
have 
dramatically increased. 
In an email to University 
students, faculty and staff last 
week, Schlissel announced a new 
draft umbrella policy for sexual 
and gender-based misconduct. 
According 
to 
Schlissel, 
the 
umbrella policy aims to clarify 
the 
University’s 
policies 
to 
ensure 
consistency 
between 
them for all University groups. 
Before the umbrella policy 
is implemented in early 2020, 
Schlissel asked members of the 
University community in an 
email to submit survey feedback 
through Nov. 22. He said the 
University continues to work on 
its goal of ensuring a safe and 
respectful community for all. 
“The 
number 
of 
sexual 
assaults and misconduct cases 
continues to be too high at U-M, 
on college campuses across the 
country, and throughout our 
society in general,” Schlissel 
wrote. “We must do everything 
we can as we strive to reduce the 
number to zero.” 

CASE
From Page 1

“You kind of just want to go with 
the flow to get things over with,” 
Ramesh said. “So, when these 
problematic things happen, you just 
kind of have to sweep them under 
the rug. And unless your professor 
makes it intentional that they’re 
open to talk about things like that, 
you’re not going to trust them with 
that information.”
In one instance, Heard, head of 
the Communications Committee 
for the DEI Task Force in the 
Business School, said she was the 
only Black woman in a class of 60 
or 70 people. She said one day, the 
professor told students to promote 
themselves in an elevator pitch, and 
then after, had students go around 
and select groups. Heard described 
the immense discomfort she felt 
from this exercise after having to 
convince people why she deserved 
to be in their group, especially 
because she was the only Black 
person in the room. 
“I literally felt like a slave in that 
instance, because I felt like I was 
begging people to buy me. I feel like 
the professor didn’t realize that’s 
how that experience would impact 
me, because there were plenty of 
groups that looked at me and were 
like, ‘we don’t want you, we just 
don’t want you’ for 30 minutes.”
According 
to 
Heard, 
her 
experience shows the significance 
of the activities and general 
teaching 
approaches 
used 
by 
professors. 
“I remember, I went home and 
I cried and I wanted to drop the 
class,” Heard said. “I didn’t end up 
dropping the class, because I had 
to remember who I was, but there’s 
been a lot of times where I feel like 
teachers don’t realize that or don’t 
take into consideration that how 
you teach or the examples you give 
in class or anything that makes up 
the class experience can impact 
someone with a different identity.”
Ramesh, who is an international 
student herself, took issue with the 
case studies her professors used 
and had students work on in class. 
Often times, these studies were 
US-centric, focusing on American 
brands and companies, which 
made it difficult for international 
students to relate. Another issue 
was with students and professors 
having trouble pronouncing certain 
students’ names in class, according 
to Ramesh.
Working towards a Race and 
Ethnicity class requirement in 
the Business School
Unlike the University’s College 
of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, 
the Business School does not have a 
race and ethnicity requirement for 
students. In LSA, all students must 
take a minimum of one course of at 
least three credits which discusses 
the meaning and effects of race, 
ethnicity and racism in the U.S. 
or across the globe in some form. 
Classes also promote discussion on 
social class, gender and/or religion.
According to Taryn Petryk, 
director of diversity and inclusion 
for the Business School, the school 
is working to have this requirement 
in the future. They also want to 
ensure that, if and when the course 
does come, students truly feel as 
though it will be beneficial to them, 
rather than just being an add-on 
class.
Business 
sophomore 
Matt 
Person 
believes 
the 
Business 
School has provided students with 
sufficient exposure to different 
backgrounds and identities thus 
far, despite not having a race and 
ethnicity requirement.
“At least from my perspective, I 
think we’re doing a lot of that within 
Ross without having a specific three 
credit course solely dedicated to it,” 
Person said. “So, I feel as if I have 
been getting exposure.”
“I had a ... general lack of 
understanding of how much 
Michigan cared about DEI”
According 
to 
Heard, 
many 
students and faculty alike feel 
there has been a communication 
gap between the Business School 
administration and the rest of 
the community. While the small 
percentage of people working 
directly 
with 
administration 
recognize the DEI work it has 
been putting in over the past 
several years, Heard said those not 
involved with the administration 
are unaware of these efforts. 
“I think that before I was part 
of taskforce, I had a very bleak 
and probably just general lack 
of understanding of how much 
Michigan cared about DEI, but in 
having these conversations through 
taskforce and just being on the 
administration level and talking to 
them about it, they really actually 
genuinely care, and that was very 

surprising for me,” Heard said. “But 
I feel like they’re struggling with 
connecting to students as well as 
communicating with students.”
As a Black woman, Heard said if 
she had understood the DEI-related 
actions the administration took as 
an underclassmen, she would have 
had an overall better experience. 
This year, the Business School 
has 
focused 
largely 
on 
the 
development of the school’s culture 
and betterment of DEI efforts, 
according to Petryk. She said 
Business Dean Scott DeRue’s 2019 
Dean’s Report highlighted these 
efforts.
“(The 
report) 
really 
talked 
about diversity and inclusion at the 
center of our values,” Petryk said. 
“I do think that there’s probably 
been some messaging gaps or 
communication gaps around what 
our values are and what we aspire 
to be, and that’s changing this year. 
We’re really focusing on the culture 
that we want to create and the 
values that we hold that really do 
stem from our deans.”
While the administration may 
be putting in effort to promote 
diversity 
this 
year, 
Ramesh 
described how its current methods 
are not effective in connecting with 
the student body.
“It’s like what would be the 
best medium to communicate 
(administration’s efforts) through, 
because no one is going to read 
the emails. They put together a 
dean’s report, but no one is going 
to read (the) report,” Ramesh 
said. “So, I think there’s no good 
medium, there’s no good way to 
communicate it in terms of what to 
say … I think that’s what we need to 
focus on.”
According 
to 
Heard, 
students should be apart of the 
administration’s messaging efforts. 
“I think (the) administration is 
just now realizing that, ‘Hey, we’re 
discussing 
amongst 
ourselves 
about how to communicate to the 
students; let’s involve students 
in a conversation to figure out 
how we should communicate to 
the students,’” Heard said. “I feel 
like once they get more students 
involved with that, things are going 
to just start rolling.”
“I am an IDO peer facilitator, 
and, even within that, I would 
say that that’s not enough”
Currently, 
the 
Business 
School provides students with 
mandatory Identity and Diversity 
in Organizations workshops, which 
“prepare students to interact with 
people from different backgrounds 
who have had different experiences 
from their own.” Workshops occur 
once a year and are 90 minutes long. 
According to Petryk, they are run by 
about 25 peer facilitators, who are 
Business upperclassmen trained in 
diversity and inclusion facilitation.
Though she sees the workshops 
as a value to students at the Business 
School, as a peer facilitator, Ramesh 
said they are not sufficient enough 
to fully educate students on the 
necessity of cultural sensitivity.
“I am an IDO peer facilitator, 
and, even within that, I would say 
that that’s not enough, because I 
engage with these students in a 
one and a half hour workshop,” 
Ramesh said. “There’s not enough 
time to build that relationship, build 
that trust, have those important 
conversations. We need a race and 
ethnicity requirement.”
The IDO workshops are solely 
offered to sophomores, juniors 
and seniors in the Business school, 
though 
certain 
students 
have 
explained the beginning years in 
the Business School are crucial for 
the students’ development. 
“I feel like once you’re a junior 
and senior, you’re kind of set or 
don’t care anymore,” Heard said. “If 
we refocused a lot of this work for 
freshman year, the culture would 
completely shift.”
According 
to 
marketing 
professor Carolyn Yoon, faculty 
director of diversity and inclusion, 
professors are moving beyond 
the IDO workshops this year by 
integrating curriculum regarding 
identity and diversity. For example, 
in Business Administration 100 
and 200 courses, professors are 
incorporating 
workshops 
to 
educate students on how their 
identities affect their opportunities 
in business.
Both faculty and students are 
aware of pushback from Business 
students who do not see the value in 
taking the IDO workshops, Petryk 
said.
“We are also working with 
some resistance which is with 
students especially within the BBA 
population around, ‘Why do I need 
to do this? Why is it important? 
How is this going to help me in 
my career?’” Petryk said. “So, we 
are working in multiple different 
ways to make that connection 

for folks who don’t necessarily 
see themselves in the problem of 
diversity and inclusion.”
According 
to 
Ramesh, 
the 
polarizing 
views 
of 
Business 
students regarding these IDO 
workshops have stemmed from 
their 
different 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds. On the one hand, 
Ramesh said white students from 
privileged backgrounds might feel 
uneasy having these discussions.
“I think it’s that students who 
come from very white, upper class 
communities are not comfortable 
talking about these things, don’t 
want to say the wrong thing, don’t 
know how to be in that environment 
because they’ve never really been in 
an uncomfortable space like that,” 
Ramesh said. 
Ramesh 
said 
that 
on 
the 
flip side, minority students are 
tired of having to have the same 
conversations regarding diversity. 
“They’re one of two of their 
identity in the entire class, and they 
have to sit in this workshop where 
they’re the only ones speaking 
for their whole community again, 
having to learn this information 
that they already know, having to 
teach their peers,” Ramesh said. 
“So, I think on both sides it’s very 
uncomfortable.”
The presence of wealth is 
especially noticeable in the Business 
School, even outside of the IDO 
workshops, according to Ramesh. 
While many people are financially 
comfortable, others without the 
same financial capabilities can be at 
a disadvantage in regards to certain 
elements of the school’s culture.
“I think SES is very noticeable 
in the way people dress and the 
way people show up,” Ramesh said. 
“Even I think just small things, like 
we do a lot of team projects and 
they encourage team bonding, and 
people tend to want to eat out, etc. 
and that’s not always accessible to 
a lot of people. Even recruiting, I 
know someone was talking about 
having to fly out for an interview, 
and you have to pay for your flight 
and they’ll reimburse you, but if you 
don’t have that money in the first 
place, it’s an obstacle.”
“The burden is always falling 
on the same people to do the 
work”
The taskforce, BBA Council 
and certain faculty members have 
worked to further improve the 
culture of Ross by trying to make 
it a more inclusive environment 
for international students and 
minorities as a whole.
Business senior and BBA Council 
President Liza Hochberg said the 
DEI taskforce has worked with 
faculty to expand the conversation 
on case studies to include a more 
diverse range of topics. Business 
senior Robbert Massie, BBA Council 
vice president of leadership and 
ethics, said in one of his courses, his 
professor now encourages student 
feedback on the cases he chooses 
and asks whether students feel they 
are inclusive for everyone. 
The taskforce also encouraged 
the introduction of name tags with 
phonetic pronunciations, which 
the Business School implemented 
schoolwide this semester.
People like Petryk and Yoon 
have led initiatives with the 
faculty to raise awareness around 
unconscious biases and how to 
promote more of an inclusive 
classroom 
environment. 
For 
instance, 
they 
run 
several 
workshops per year for faculty 
within 
the 
Business 
School. 
Within the past two years, faculty 
evaluations also explicitly ask 
professors questions about what 
they are doing in terms of inclusive 
teaching practices and promoting 
DEI. 
“That signals and lets the faculty 
know that this is an important part 
of their professional development 
and it matters,” Yoon said. “And 
the vast majority of faculty really 
care and they do show up to 
these workshops, and many have 
thought very carefully about how 
to incorporate that into their own 
teaching or pedagogy.”
Ramesh said though great work 
is being done, more people need to 
be involved in efforts to better DEI 
at the Business School. Plus, those 
who are currently involved should 
get the recognition they deserve. 
“The burden is always falling on 
the same people to do the work, and 
there is so much work to do that it 
cannot just be them anymore, and it 
cannot be them doing this work and 
then upper administration getting 
credit,” Ramesh said. “I mean, if 
our diversity numbers go up, or 
students of color are landing these 
amazing job offers and things like 
that, it doesn’t fall on the programs 
that put them through this. It’s not 
often that those programs and the 
amazing people that lead them will 
get credit.”

Legalizing marijuana should include 
retroactively clearing convictions
S

ince 
Colorado 
and 
Washington 
legalized 
recreational 
marijuana 
use in 2012, nine more states 
and the District of Columbia 
have legalized small amounts 
of marijuana for recreational 
consumption. An additional 15 
states have decriminalized it, 
making it a civil infraction or 
low-level misdemeanor with no 
possibility of jail time. Despite 
these recent trends, thousands 
of people across the United 
States continue to have records 
of marijuana convictions, even 
in states that have legalized or 
decriminalized it. Though some 
states have instituted policies 
to address this, every state that 
has legalized marijuana should 
automatically 
expunge 
all 
convictions and clear citizens’ 
records. 
States 
should 
clear 
marijuana convictions because 
those records can continue to 
haunt past offenders. Even if 
the state in which they were 
charged no longer considers it 
a crime to possess or consume 
small amounts of marijuana, 
people still struggle to access 
public services or get jobs. 
A 71-year-old Vermont man 
named Glyn Wilkinson was 
first charged with a marijuana 
violation in 1968. As a result, 
he was unable to purchase 
a firearm and even travel to 
Canada. Wilkinson’s record 
was cleared last year on an 
“Expungement Day,” during 
which he was required to 
travel to Burlington. Rather 
than making someone petition 
the state and travel to clear 
their record, the states that 
have legalized marijuana use 
should do it automatically. 
Before 
Illinois 
legalized 
marijuana, 42 percent of all 
drug arrests in that state were 
for cannabis-related offenses. 
Since 
prosecutors 
targeted 
marijuana users during the 
War on Drugs, the default 
should be to update every 
offender’s record to current 
standards. If someone was 
charged with a misdemeanor 
for an act that is now legal, 
that charge should be wiped 
from their record. 

Furthermore, 
marijuana 
enforcement 
historically 
disproportionately targets African 
Americans. Despite the fact that 
people across all races consume 
marijuana at similar rates, African 
Americans are almost four times 
as likely as white people to be 
arrested for possession of cannabis. 
Legalization is a way to stop this 
specific instance of discrimination 
going forward, but it does not 
address the continuing effects 
of these historically oppressive 
policies. 
While 
automatically 
clearing records does not erase 
the actions of the past, it is a step 
in the right direction. Since drug 
convictions 
negatively 
impact 
people’s eligibility for federal 
student aid, clearing records is all 
the more important in ensuring 
the ability of Americans to attend 
college and university.

Some states have taken the 
initiative 
and 
have 
already 
begun to automatically clear 
past 
marijuana 
convictions. 
California in particular has been 
making headway on this issue. 
After marijuana was legalized 
there, officials expected waves 
of people to petition to clear 
their old convictions, but the 
process was so complicated most 
people did not even attempt it. 
To remedy that problem, the 
counties of Los Angeles and 
San Joaquin enacted plans to 
automatically clear or decrease 
the 54,000 recorded convictions. 
San 
Francisco 
did 
similarly 
and promised to clear 9,300 
convictions going back decades. 
Aside from the concrete issues 
associated with the failure of 
states to remove convictions, 
moral issues still exist with 
leaving them on the books. The 

point of maintaining criminal 
records is to make certain 
people who may come into 
contact with the person, such 
as employers or universities, 
are aware of serious problems 
regarding a person’s conduct. 
But because certain states no 
longer believe that possession 
of marijuana is as serious an 
offense, 
punishing 
someone 
with that outdated standard 
undermines the legal system.
To be clear, this does not 
work the other way around. A 
state should not press charges 
against someone who acted 
a certain way if the act was 
subsequently 
made 
illegal. 
That is called an ex post facto 
law, and it is immoral to punish 
someone based on an action 
that was unpunishable when it 
occurred. On the other hand, if 
someone acts in a certain way 
that society eventually comes 
to understand as legal, their 
record ought to reflect the same 
data as someone who engaged 
in the newly legal activity. The 
difference between the two lies 
in standards of culpability —
that of the state versus that of 
an individual. If an individual 
engages in an activity that is 
legal when it happens, but the 
state outlaws it afterwards, it 
is unacceptable to punish the 
individual for an action that was 
legal at the time it happened. 
On the other hand, if a state 
eventually changes its laws to 
legalize a certain action, the 
state is acknowledging that it 
was in the wrong to prosecute 
anyone for that action when it 
was illegal and therefore should 
make amends by wiping the 
convictions. 
As more states legalize and 
decriminalize marijuana, they 
face the issue of what to do 
with past convictions. Since 
it is clear that keeping these 
criminal records makes it far 
more difficult for convicted 
Americans to get jobs and 
federal student aid, and that 
it 
disproportionately 
targets 
people of color, those states 
should clear these convictions.

When partisanship poisons the Supreme Court
S

ince 
its 
inception, 
the 
Supreme Court has long 
been 
regarded 
as 
the 
United 
States’ 
arbitrator of the law. 
It was created as a 
neutral institution, 
devoid of any bias 
or party inclination, 
only to intervene 
when legislative or 
executive 
action 
deviated from what 
was constitutional. 
Yet now the Supreme 
Court, 
previously 
seen by some as 
the quintessence of justice, has 
been plagued by the partisanship 
that has afflicted other facets of 
American government. As a result, 
American legislators should seek 
to reconsider our interpretation 
of 
the 
Constitution’s 
“good 
behavior” clause in order to better 
combat the maladies partisanship 
has created. 
Tracing back to Federalist No. 
78, Alexander Hamilton dictated 
that the judicial branch would 
be the weakest of the three, as 
it would only issue judgments 
and remain dependent on the 
other two branches for efficacy. 
Furthermore, Article III of the 
Constitution, which established 
the judicial branch of the federal 
government, 
refrained 
from 
delineating the exact organization 
of the Supreme Court, leaving 
its development largely up to 
Congress. What was specified, 
though, was that judges would 
continue to hold their offices 
during good behavior. This “good 
behavior” clause maintains that 
those who serve as judges for 
the Supreme Court can only be 
removed from office through 
impeachment 
— 
essentially 
establishing lifelong tenure. 
The purpose of lifelong tenure 
was to sequester judges from any 
volatile political landscape that 
could jeopardize the integrity of 
the court. Judicial independence 
was imperative to the notion of a 
Supreme Court; with a lifetime 

term, judges could execute their 
duties in preserving the intentions 
of the Constitution unbeholden 
to external pressures. 
The gravity of judicial 
independence 
only 
intensified with Marbury 
v. 
Madison, 
which 
ruled that the Supreme 
Court could void acts by 
Congress that it deemed 
unconstitutional. 
As 
a 
result, 
Supreme 
Court justices are now 
given 
the 
immense 
responsibility 
of 
impartially interpreting 
the Constitution out of duty simply 
by serving on the highest tribunal 
of the land.

But truly how impartial are the 
judges of today? In the last two 
Supreme Courts, more than 20 
percent of all rulings were decided 
by a 5-4 majority: pre-World War 
II, less than 5 percent were. Unlike 
in the past, the voting behavior 
of most any justice can be highly 
predictable given the party of the 
president who appointed them. 
In fact, six out of the ten most 
important Supreme Court cases 
thus far in 2019 were decided along 
ostensible partisan lines, with an 
added swing vote by either Chief 
Justice John Roberts or Associate 
Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This 
newfound court polarization can 
be attributed to the changing 
dynamic 
of 
norms 
regarding 
judicial appointment, for example, 
strategically-timed 
retirements 
by judges and near-exclusive 

consideration 
of 
ideological 
similarity and reliability by 
presidents. With justices voting 
so commonly along party lines in 
controversial cases, the Supreme 
Court seems to be nothing more 
than a puppet of the executive 
branch.
The framework of European 
nations’ constitutional courts 
demonstrate that perhaps our 
Supreme Court isn’t doomed to 
democratic degeneracy if reform 
can be achieved. In Germany, 
the 
appointment 
process 
is 
conducted 
bipartisanly, 
with 
negotiation 
between 
both 
parties 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
concord on suitable judicial 
candidates. Spain and Portugal 
similarly require a legislative 
supermajority 
in 
order 
to 
confirm 
most 
or 
all 
court 
nominees. European nations’ 
implementation of a bipartisan 
confirmation 
process 
seems 
much more sensible, and the 
United States would be wise to 
imitate it if it hopes to overcome 
its rampant hyperpartisanship. 
Fortunately, modifying our 
current Supreme Court wouldn’t 
even 
require 
the 
arduous 
amendment process. The “good 
behavior” clause is ambiguously 
worded, and it’s possible that 
our Founding Fathers meant 
something other than till death 
when articulating the length of 
a judge’s tenure. Rather, “good 
behavior” could plausibly be 
interpreted as behavior in which 
the duties of office are executed 
professionally and righteously. 
And with the blatant partisanship 
seen on the Supreme Court today, 
it isn’t unreasonable to believe 
that the current state of the 
court is not in good behavior. 
Therefore, 
a 
simple 
act 
of 
Congress would suffice as a step 
in the right direction to fight the 
plague of hyperpartisanship that 
has weakened the integrity of our 
nation.

Who is to blame for America’s opioid crisis?
T

he epidemic surrounding 
opioid 
abuse 
in 
the 
United 
States 
is 
inescapable. On average, 140 
Americans 
die 
everyday 
of 
drug overdoses, with over 90 
of those deaths resulting from 
opioid abuse alone. Accidental 
drug overdoses recently became 
the leading cause of death by 
injury for Americans under 50, 
surpassing homicides and car 
accidents. Beyond the obvious 
impact on human life, the current 
opioid crisis has had massive 
economic effects. The Centers 
for Disease Control estimates 
that the economic costs of the 
opioid epidemic total around 
$78.5 billion every year, including 
“healthcare, lost productivity, 
addiction 
treatment, 
and 
criminal justice” costs. By this 
point, it is clear that the opioid 
epidemic is a colossal emergency 
our society faces. Much less clear, 
though, are the reasons behind 
this outbreak of substance abuse 
disorders and exactly what steps 
can be taken to combat it. 
The 
catastrophic 
level 
of opioid abuse has become 
increasingly common in recent 
years. As cases of addiction 
and overdose deaths reach new 
heights, many Americans are 
looking for the reasons behind 
the mounting crisis and where 
to place the blame. The obvious 
first place to look for many is 
the pharmaceutical industry. 
In terms of history, this is 
a logical place to start. The 
opioid crisis in its current form 
effectively began in the 1990s. 
In 1996, Purdue Pharma began 
manufacturing 
OxyContin, 
a narcotic used to manage 
moderate to severe pain. Prior to 
this point, doctors in the United 
States had demonstrated a long 
history of what was referred to 
as “opiophobia,” or an extreme 
resistance in prescribing opioids 
because of the possibility of 
addiction.
In order to combat this trend 
and, in effect, increase their 
drug 
sales, 
pharmaceutical 
companies began to aggressively 
market their products. Such 
companies 
also 
started 
to 
engage in misleading advertising 
techniques. 
For 
example, 
pharmaceutical 
company 
Endo International sponsored 
a website claiming that the 
notion 
of 
opioid 
painkillers 
causing addiction was a myth. 
As a result of such marketing, 
health care providers began 
to prescribe opioids at ever 
increasing 
rates. 
Since 
this 
point, 
opioids 
have 
become 
dangerously 
overprescribed, 
with 
prescription 
sales 
increasing 
alarmingly 
since 
1999. Opioid use thus became 
more widespread, and opioid-
related overdose deaths much 
more common.
The immoral acts of companies 
such 
as 
Purdue, 
Allergan, 
Johnson & Johnson and Endo 
in prioritizing their own profits 
over the lives of their consumers 
are 
clearly 
reprehensible. 
In fact, over 35 percent of 
all 
opioid-overdose 
related 

deaths 
are 
from 
prescribed 
opioids, 
demonstrating 
just 
how influential the actions 
of pharmaceutical companies 
were in creating the current 
epidemic. The guilt of the 
pharmaceutical 
industry 
is 
highlighted by the abundance 
of lawsuits against varying 
companies over their roles in 
manufacturing the crisis.
However, 
pharmaceutical 
companies do not stand alone 
in their guilt. The government 
officials who enabled the sales 
of opioid drugs to skyrocket are 
equally to blame in the opioid 
crisis. Agencies such as the 
Food and Drug Administration 
and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration were created 
to protect the American people 
from abuses and misuses of 
drug 
distribution 
such 
as 
this one. This past summer, 
a federal court ordered the 
release of DEA-collected data, 
revealing 
that 
the 
agency 
began collecting data on the 
manufacture, distribution, and 
sale of all opioid pills in 2006. 

Despite the documentation of 
data recording the astronomical 
surge in opioid sales and related 
overdose 
deaths, 
the 
DEA 
effectively did nothing to help 
save the lives of American 
people. In conjunction with 
the 
malicious 
marketing 
techniques employed by the 
pharmaceutical 
industry 
beginning in the 1990s, the 
inaction of the government 
in the face of clear misuse of 
opioid prescription implicates it 
in the current state of the opioid 
epidemic. 
It is difficult to deny that 
the disastrous effects of the 
opioid crisis clearly have their 
origins in abuses of power and 
governmental inaction. More 
difficult than determining the 
overall causes of the epidemic, 
though, is figuring out how to 
handle the effects. As hundreds 
of thousands of people die 
of drug overdoses annually, 
it is clear that the current 
methods of dealing with the 
crisis are not working. Many 
pharmaceutical companies are 
in the early stages of being held 
accountable for their own parts 
in the epidemic. Most recently, 
a $260 million settlement was 
reached between three major 
drug distributors and two Ohio 
counties, 
allowing 
them 
to 
avoid the first federal opioid 
trial. The government should 
begin to acknowledge their own 
guilt by vowing to combat the 
epidemic more aggressively.

They can first do this by 
portraying opioid addiction 
and related substance abuse 
issues as the mental health 
issues 
they 
are, 
instead 
of 
criminalizing 
them. 
The 
decriminalization 
is 
particularly necessary in Black 
communities or communities 
of lower socioeconomic status. 
The majority of the media 
attention on the opioid crisis 
has been on white Americans, 
and the reason for this may 
be the fact that opioid deaths 
among 
white 
individuals 
outnumber 
those 
among 
Black individuals. However, 
deaths from opioid overdoses 
are more rapidly increasing 
among 
Black 
Americans. 
Furthermore, 
Black 
drug 
addicts are more likely to be 
portrayed as criminals than 
their 
white 
counterparts, 
who are more often seen as 
requiring medical treatment. 
In the pursuit of combating 
the opioid epidemic through 
decriminalization, 
it 
is 
imperative 
to 
include 
all 
demographics in this process, 
especially those who have been 
hit hardest by the criminal 
justice system.
Beyond 
the 
total 
decriminalization of opioids, 
the 
federal 
government 
should fund and implement 
effective 
public 
education 
and 
awareness 
campaigns 
about 
the 
opioid 
crisis, 
including 
instructional 
information 
about 
where 
to find effective treatment 
options. 
Furthermore, 
the 
government 
should 
additionally 
develop, 
fund 
and implement more effective 
school and community-based 
prevention techniques. These 
techniques 
must 
be 
non-
punitive in nature and address 
the often underlying mental 
health issues that contribute 
to opioid addiction.
Finally, 
the 
federal 
government must circle back 
to the origins of the crisis and 
be more stringent in holding 
the DEA accountable in their 
documentation of opioid sales. 
This can include requiring 
that the DEA uphold stricter 
standards 
in 
the 
issuance 
of registrations to doctors 
with the ability to prescribe 
opioid medications, as well 
as the prohibition of direct-
to-consumer 
advertising 
of 
opioids. 
The 
complexity 
and 
magnitude 
of 
the 
current 
opioid crisis in the United 
States is overwhelming. It is 
important to avoid getting 
caught up in the intricacies 
and hold those responsible to 
account. By holding both the 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
and the federal government 
accountable for the epidemic, 
society can begin to more fully 
combat the crisis and prevent 
any further catastrophic loss 
of life.

Disney rarely puts out unsuccessful movies; almost 
all of their films please fans and maintain box-office 
success. Often, the movies do well in the box office 
because fans can expect to enjoy a Disney film, but 
that doesn’t mean that all the films are necessarily 
amazing. Most Disney films fall somewhere in 
a neutral middle ground — not bad, not great. 
“Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,” directed by Joachim 
Rønning (“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell 
No Tales), fits perfectly in this 
category. Overall, the film’s 
not a bad watch, especially 
with kids who would love the 
fairytale aspects and the special 
effects, but it’s still a film with a 
lot of issues, especially in how 
the plot unfolds.
“Mistress of Evil” picks 
up five years after its 2014 
predecessor, 
“Maleficent.” 
Aurora, played by Elle Fanning 
(“Super 8”), who now rules over the Moors as their 
wide-eyed, barefoot, fairy-like queen, accepts a 
marriage proposal from Prince Philip (Harris 
Dickinson, “Trust”). Their union has the potential 
to link their respective kingdoms, the Moors and 
Ulstead, but Philip’s mother, Queen Ingrith (Michelle 
Pfeiffer, “Batman Returns”), has other plans. The 
premise of the plot, though a little derivative with its 
fairytale aspects and evil mother-in-law, is tolerable. 
Despite the plot not being unique, the film has some 
really high points. Where the movie succeeds is in its 
stellar understanding and explanation of two major 
characters and their bond: Maleficent (Angelina 
Jolie, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”) and Aurora. The two 
talented actresses do a fabulous job of making their 
relationship seem real; little details like Aurora 
being the only one who was able to calm Maleficent 
down, Maleficent practicing how to smile to avoid 
make a bad impression on Philip’s parents and their 
nicknaming of each other (Godmother and Beastie), 
all contributed to a believable mother-daughter-like 
relationship. Disney’s attention to detail makes for 
wonderful world-building.
However, the amount of plot holes in the movie 

make it difficult to follow and frustrating to watch. 
One of the most confusing parts of the movie is 
understanding the motive that Queen Ingrith had 
for wanting to hurt Maleficent personally. Ingrith’s 
grudge against the fae kingdom in general makes 
some sense after hearing her backstory (though told 
too late, in the last 45 minutes of the film), but the 
feelings of resentment and hatred that she harbors 
against Maleficent alone seem unfounded and 
unbelievable.
The other plot hole, this one even harder to ignore, 
is the reveal of an underground society of Maleficent-
like creatures. We get very little background on them 

as a group, just that they were driven into hiding 
by humans. We miss out on learning the extent of 
their history, and more importantly, why Maleficent 
doesn’t know they exist when she seems to play 
such an important role in their hierarchy. With the 
addition of these creatures in the movie, it feels like 
too much was going on at once, with not enough 
detail or time spent on anything. 
“Mistress of Evil” is a nice escape from 
midterm stress and 40-degree October weather 
in Michigan, but not a must-see. It’s one of those 
trademarked Disney movies that you know you’ll 
enjoy and you know will have a ‘happily ever after,’ 
but not necessarily worth spending ticket money 
on. In a world of Disney live-action remakes and 
in the era of sequels, “Maleficent: Mistress of 
Evil” falls exactly where you would expect it to. It 
doesn’t have the nostalgia of the original cartoon 
“Sleeping Beauty” nor the novelty of the 2014 film 
— the live-action remake that started the trend. 
It feels obvious that they dragged out a sequel to 
make money, and while it wasn’t an unenjoyable 
film, it didn’t feel necessary. I think it’s safe to say 
that this probably won’t be a trilogy, and that’s OK.

Colette Fellous’s “This Tilting World” takes place 
at the shoreline of a nameless sea. There, its narrator 
reflects on the 2015 Sousse mass shootings that had 
occurred just a day before, the lives and deaths of 
various men in her life and the many places she has 
called home. The novel’s slimness tricks readers into 
believing they are in for a quick and simple read; I felt 
slightly betrayed when I realized (just a few pages in) 
that I had been made a fool. “This Tilting World” is 
dense. The winding passages are devoid of quotation 
marks and steeped in poetics, which effectively has 
the effect of making me feel as though my body was 
being hit with wave after wave of text, struggling to 
stay alive and afloat.
“This Tilting World” is filled with descriptions of 
the people, marketplaces, foods and smells of Tunisia, 
France and other places the narrator has lived and 
loved in. The novel is described as being “a love letter 
to (the narrator’s) homeland,” but it is arguably also a 
love letter to her father, literature and her life itself, 
which she is reflecting on in response to the massacre 
that had unfolded the previous day, and the death of 
her friend Alain. Once I reached the end of the novel, 
I understood how Fellous combines these elements 

to paint a portrait of the burden of responsibility and 
guilt of being a child of expatriates, one who is also 
without a country she can firmly claim as “home.” 
The narrator has inherited the trauma of exile from 
her parents; it has become “(her) wound now.” 
“...I felt like an orphan even when my parents 
surrounded me with the best they could provide… 
this is what I’ve done all my life: cradle (my father), 
cradle them both in their innocence and sweetness, 
and even cradle what I call the country … Tunisia or 

the long-past memories of my parents? I don’t know. I 
held them up so they would not collapse.” 
This is one of those books that lack a cohesive 
plot structure. This writing style, however, is the 
novel’s downfall. Without the aid of the back cover, 
it is hard to understand what “This Tilting World” is 
even about. Minimal plot structure can be liberating 
if done right, but Fellous’s writing is suffocating. 
I initially attributed it to the fact that the novel is 
translated from French. I attempted to slow down and 
savor the prose, thinking that perhaps I was rushing 
too much and it would be more comprehensible if I 
tiptoed my way through the landmine of poetics. I 
soon realized, though, that there was no escaping the 
convoluted nature of the text. I discovered that the 
most effective way for me to read the novel was to 
skim it slightly, or at least not dwell too long on every 
sentence. But there were undeniably several gems, 
including this image-heavy moment of reflection: 
“So many images in a few seconds. With each sip 
the throbbing of even more invisible hearts joins 
me, moments of a life, reflections of light on a face, 
the scars of hours, culled from the past or perhaps 
still unknown, thousands of sparks dissolved in my 
every breath. Hearts in thrall drawing together. 
Geraniums, pink and white carnations, the unfurling 
leaves of bougainvillea, odd fragments of broken 
pots, pieces of colored glass…” 
The way that Fellous writes feels 
as though she is a poet attempting 
to pummel a very long poem into 
submission 
through 
the 
rigid 
structure of a fiction novel. Pummel 
romantically, of course. Fallous’s 
writing style is refined, but too 
flowery for my taste. I felt minimal 
connection to any of the characters, 
even the narrator herself. While there 
are several segments of the text that 
are undeniably beautiful, they are 
too far and few between to fully appreciate, and 
wrapped in a complicated snarl of text that made 
my eyes glaze over. 
“This Tilting World” is certainly not an easy 
read. See, the thing about love letters is that they 
are meant for one person in particular. The letter 
that “This Tilting World” offers is carefully crafted, 
laced with beautiful prose, but, unfortunately, 
intended for the select few who enjoy murky plot 
structures and poetry-prose hybrids.

‘Mistress of Evil’ is lacking

For The Daily

When I first volunteered to write about METAL 
GALAXY, I didn’t know what I was getting into. I had 
a vague memory of BABYMETAL as a band with some 
sort of gimmick. My editor said it was right up my alley, 
which upon first listening to “Chocolate,” I understood 
that to mean BABYMETAL was in line with my taste 
for weird and unique. Later I would remember where 
I first heard the band: My JPop-superfan cousins were 
showing me videos of them performing on YouTube 
back in 2012. BABYMETAL might be kind of a meme, 
but their staying power is beyond any gimmick.
Somewhere at the intersection of anime and Death 
Grips, BABYMETAL has amassed an enormous 
international following for their hardcore-cute JPop-
metal fusion. Its members, Su-Metal and Moa-Metal, 
are pulled straight from the Japanese idol industry, 
which reflects in the band’s focus on performance 
and theatrics. The core members sing and dance 
and scream at their shows, while a group of backing 
musicians (called Kami Band) provide the heavy metal 
instrumentation.
The band’s idol industry roots are crystal clear in their 
sound. Something to get comfortable with to properly 
enjoy this record is that most of the music sounds 
like it was concocted by record company executives 
spitballing ideas at a round table meeting. For “Shanti 
Shanti Shanti,” the men in suits said, “BABYMETAL, 
but make it ‘Aladdin.’” For “OH! Majinai,” they said 
the same, but fantasy-renaissance. This is a natural 
extension of how the band came to be in the first place 
— somebody said “Baby, but make it metal,” and now 
here we are.
While BABYMETAL’s existence is itself a left hook, 
the tracklist on METAL GALAXY rolls out surprise 
punch after surprise punch. The guests are unexpected 
and brilliant. Japanese music legend Tak Matsumoto 
plays guitar on “DA DA DANCE.” Tim Henson and 
Scott LePage of Polyphia fame help compose “Brand 
New Day.” Thai rapper F.Hero spits a verse on “PA PA 
YA!!” Sweden has multiple footprints on the album: 
Joakim Brodén, vocalist of Swedish power metal band 
Sabaton, singing and screaming on “OH! Majinai,” and 
Alissa White-Gluz, vocalist of Swedish death metal 

band Arch Enemy, growling on “Distortion.” Despite 
these features, nothing can eclipse the bizarre power of 
young women singing over aggressive heavy metal, so 
every track remains distinctly BABYMETAL.
Other than the novel JPop-metal mix, it’s hard to 
pinpoint what is distinctly BABYMETAL; they skillfully 
juggle so many different sounds in their music. “Da Da 
Dance” manages to smuggle a bit of electropop into 
the album. “Arkadia” oozes with Dragonforce energy. 
While “Elevator Girl,” “Shanti Shanti Shanti” and 
“OH! Majinai” are clearly contrived to have a certain 
aesthetic (just like everything about BABYMETAL), it 
all still kinda bangs.
All the global fame that BABYMETAL capitalizes on 
with their international sounds, however, complicates 
the issue of Western influence on Asian media. The 

current media talk about American studios altering their 
content to get through Chinese censorship makes me 
wonder how much Asian media producers are coloring 
their material to be Western-friendly. “Elevator Girl,” 
sung entirely in English, is a clear appeal to a Western 
audience. I can’t speak to the songwriting on the rest of 
METAL GALAXY — I can’t understand it — but based 
on the lyrics to “Elevator Girl,” I think I prefer to keep 
things a mystery. And yet, the track has been integral to 
the band’s international promotion, coinciding with the 
announcement of their most recent world tour.
For the purpose of providing tracks to perform 
live, METAL GALAXY is a great addition to 
BABYMETAL. While the band has an enormously 
talented support system — the backing band’s 
instrumentation is often skillful and flashy, and 
the guests are highly accomplished — the joy of 
BABYMETAL is in their music videos and live 
performances. More than anything else, listening 
to METAL GALAXY has had me on the lookout for 
BABYMETAL’s next stop in Detroit.

New BABYMETAL is a trip

I’ve only been in love once, and it was 
with the back of a stranger’s head on the two 
train. I was listening to Frankie Cosmos and 
had just spilled cold brew on my sundress, 
so it was ripe to happen. I looked up from 
my New York Times Crossword app and my 
eyes met his cervical vertebrae; it was magic. 
His head wasn’t perfectly round, like maybe 
he was dropped a few times as a baby. I was 
intrigued. He had just gotten a haircut, I could 
tell because his neck was still slightly red. He 
wore a suit that was just a little wrinkled, as if 
to say I am employed but I don’t own an iron. 
His socks were “Firefly” themed — the show, 
not the bug. He listened to his music or podcast 
(probably podcast) on wired headphones, not 
AirPods, a rare sighting in New York City or 
Ann Arbor nowadays.
His posture looked like he had been touched 
by scoliosis or hit a growth spurt late in high 
school. He wasn’t popular in high school but 
he wasn’t unpopular. His friend group was 
solid and he still keeps in touch with some of 
them, they catch up every time he comes home 
for Thanksgiving at the diner they used to 
frequent. He probably went to a good college, 
maybe one in the Ivy League, but not Harvard 
or Yale, one of the underrated ones like Brown 
or Cornell. He probably studied English or 
history or political science or my favorite, 
philosophy. There was a time where I only 
dated philosophy majors, not because I love 
philosophy but because I love guys who think 
they’re smarter than me and then proving 
them wrong. But he wasn’t like that, he was 
considerate, he calls his mom once a week, he 
has a little sister he cares madly about but not 
in a weird way.
His family had a golden retriever named 
Florence but she died in a tragic car accident 
when he was eight years old. His dad ran her 
over in the family Jeep but they never told 
him that. His parents replaced Florence with 
a beagle named Harry but it wasn’t the same. 
He played soccer in elementary school and he 

was really good. When people asked him what 
he wanted to be when he grew up he said a 
professional soccer player and people kind of 
believed him because he was so confident. He 
still has that air of confidence, the certainty 
of a child telling someone what they want to 
be when they grow up. When all the other 
boys on the team hit their growth spurts in 
seventh grade, he was still the same size. 
He didn’t hit puberty till age 15. His soccer 
dreams faded, but he had new hobbies, new 
passions. He loved playing street hockey with 
his buddies and flying small planes above his 
neighborhood. He had a highschool girlfriend. 
She was controlling and paranoid. He lost his 
virginity to her when he was 17 in the back of 
the family Jeep, the one that killed his dog.
He plays golf with his dad on the weekends 
and helps his mom in the garden. He has a 
collection of thimbles from everywhere he 
has traveled. He loved to travel so he studied 
abroad in Spain. He fell in love with a girl he 
met in Cartagena named Anna. They had a 
short-lived courtship and a tearful goodbye at 
the end of the semester. She sends him nudes 
sometimes. His name was Ethan or Adam or 
Josh or Nathan or Peter, definitely not Jason. 
His eyes were blue or brown, definitely not 
green. I didn’t know anything about him apart 
from the back of his head but I felt like I knew 
him.
His face was a mystery but I could see it 
clearly in my head. He had strong features 
with a softness to them. He had braces when 
he was young but he doesn’t wear his retainer 
so his teeth have shifted a bit, adding some 
imperfection to his perfected pearly whites. 
His jawline was sharp enough to cut marble. 
He was a suburban James Dean, a Jewish 
Marlon Brando, the long lost Franco brother. 
He was perfect.
It was rush hour, people shuffled in and out 
but he stayed right where he was, trying to 
figure out the Casper-mattress advertisement 
riddles. We got off at the same stop downtown 
and I walked behind him for a little while 
hoping to catch a glimpse of his face, to see if 
he was everything I imagined he was. He left 
the station before I could even see it.

Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. They hit it off, 
hold hands into the sunset, get married, have 
kids — the whole shebang. It’s a tale that’s been 
recycled throughout all of time, and while it’s not 
entirely realistic, it doesn’t mean there’s no hope 
for us. As society has slowly started to realize, love 
takes shape in infinite forms, and “Modern Love” 
presents this to us in a beautiful, realistic, painful 
and sometimes convoluted way. The eight-episode 
anthology was inspired by a column in The New 

York Times under the same name, and portrays 
love stories in a light that’s true to life. Like all 
great anthologies, some episodes will stand out 
among the rest and leave you thinking for days, 
and some will simply disappoint. This season has 
a strong start and finish with not much of value in 
between, but a great part of the anthology format 
is that you can skip episodes without missing a 
beat. 
Under a common theme of love, each episode 
features nuances of affection rarely seen on the 
big screen: The platonic love between a woman 
and her doorman, the ones that got away, two gay 
men and their adopted daughter and a bipolar 
woman and herself, to name a few. These episodes 

were some of the most impressive ones from the 
series, and their departures from the romance 
genre are just enough to provide a fresh new 
take, but not far enough to be cold and detached. 
They hit you just as hard as any cheesy love story 
would, but force you to think about love in a more 
realistic sense. 
The episode featuring Anne Hathaway (“The 
Hustle”), in which a woman reconciles herself 
with the presence of her own mental illness, 
marks the end of a great start to the season. After 
that, the season takes a weird dip downward 
into the territory of stale acting and unrelatable 
plotlines. The worst and frankly creepiest 
episode of the season is about a young girl named 
Maddy (Julia Garner, “Dirty John”) with serious 
daddy issues. She attaches herself to Peter (Shea 
Whigham, “Joker”), a higher-up at her workplace 
who seems to be around 30 years older than her. 
Long story short, she begins to see him as a father 
figure, he thinks of her differently, mixed signals 
are exchanged and things get very, very weird. 
Maddy’s story makes you wonder whether the 
creators thought it was supposed to be watchable. 
On the bright side, the good stuff picks back up in 
the last two episodes of the season. 
If you’re a crier, you’ll surely shed tears at the 
best parts of the series. It crushes you, gives you 
hope, rinses and repeats. With the diversity of 
topics the stories cover, anyone should be able 
to find an episode they vibe with the most and, 
who knows, maybe it’ll be the daddy issues one. 
The anthology format makes the show a lot more 
watchable and digestible, and we can only hope 
that the show will get picked up for a second 
season so we can continue feeling all the things.

TV REVIEW

When Zac Brown Band released Welcome Home 
in 2017, it sounded as though they were home 
to stay. Songs like “Roots” and “Family Table” 
celebrated Brown’s family-man image and firmly 
planted the band back in the country soundscape in 
which they started. But this September, the band’s 
latest album, The Owl, found them on a different 
planet. The Owl is Frankenstein’s monster: Dance-
pop beat drops, questionable lyrics, rock and 
country all mashed together haphazardly. It’s not 
like there weren’t any warning signs beforehand — 
Zac explicitly made the leap in 2016 by starting the 
EDM trio Sir Rosevelt. It’s just that Welcome Home 
seemed to promise that these interests would 
be kept separate. The Owl blends them together. 
Unsurprisingly, fans were disappointed. But what 
was most shocking was when Zac Brown doubled 
down on his new sound by dropping a solo pop 
album, The Controversy, a week later. Then fans 
were worried.
The band’s album titles have always been 
markers of their artistic development. Their first 
album, The Foundation, poured the foundation 
for Zac Brown Band’s wheelhouse with hits 
like “Chicken Fried” and “Toes.” These songs 
established the band in its corner of country music 
filled with strings, salt water and sincerity. Jekyll + 
Hyde (2015) embodied two personas — one at the 
beach, one suited for the club, both still country. 
This album is sonically closest to The Owl, the only 
difference on the former is that Brown doesn’t try 
to be both Jekyll and Hyde at the same time. 
The Owl is an equally revealing title. Like Zac 
Brown’s interest in the EDM world, owls aren’t 
seen as much as they are understood to always 
be around, living in the shadows. Additionally, 
owls are nocturnal. So it’s fitting that The Owl 
would come out during a period of darkness for 
Zac Brown a year after he and his wife announced 
they were separating. The first song, “The Woods,” 
invites the listener into that darkness and a side 
of the band they’ve never seen before, while 
acknowledging that a longtime fan might decline 
the invitation.
“What makes me smile / might make you cry” 
he shrugs over an auto-tuned and fiddle-heavy 
pop track. While “The Woods” is bearable, other 
tracks, like “OMW,” are not. “When you see that 
OMW / OMW / meaning I’m on my way, yeah / 
hell yeah / I’m on my way, yeah,” Brown croons 
like a dad rushing to hook up with someone half his 
age. Most of the songs on The Owl fall somewhere 
in between. For example, “Already on Fire” has a 

believable Western film groove and catchy hook 
that a deep, dark, out-of-nowhere autotuned 
bridge derails.
The title of Brown’s solo album, The Controversy, 
speaks for itself. It’s clear that Brown knew what 
he was about to incite when he dropped it. Labelled 
pop instead of country, (unlike The Owl), the 
album still feels too busy with EDM, hip hop, R&B 
and rock meshed together. But the music itself isn’t 
really what I have a problem with, it’s the lyrics. 
In “Swayze,” Brown brags that, “every time I get 
a new bitch, I need a new bitch.” It’s so gross that 
it’s comical. In “This Far,” the song questions how 
he became so successful — something listeners 
will be wondering throughout the album, Brown 
sings, “No C-G / I’m still I” so solemnly I can’t help 
but smile. The only joy I get from listening to The 
Controversy is from recognizing how ridiculous it 
is. 
Every artist changes their sound. Whether it’s 
a switch in genre or producers, a musician’s urge 
to try something new is as natural as a fan’s initial 
discomfort in hearing their favorite band sound 
different. But I don’t feel uncomfortable listening 
to The Owl or even The Controversy despite how 
cringe-worthy both can be. I just feel sad. It’s 
tempting to write an obituary for the Zac Brown 
Band, but the situation is worse than that. No-fun 
attempts to push genre boundaries like Jekyll + 
Hyde, The Owl and The Controversy sound like 
cries for help. It’s assumed that when musicians go 
through difficult times, they make their best music. 
But what happens when an artist already made 
meaningful music about their happy everyday life, 
and then has their world flipped upside down? In 
Zac Brown’s case, all that was deep turns shallow.
Still, there are two songs to return to out of all 
of this. “Someone That I Used to Know” pulls off 
EDM-country and offers some explanation for 
the band’s new direction. “When you keep on 
losing / with the path you’re choosing / then it’s 
time to let go / of someone that I used to know,” 
Brown advises. Unfortunately, that someone 
seems to be the “cold beer on a Friday night / 
pair of jeans that fit just right” beanie-wearing 
Zac Brown fans grew to love. The other song is 
The Owl’s closer “Leaving Love Behind.” Entirely 
acoustic with gorgeous harmonies, this song is so 
good it’s frustrating. It’s a reminder of what the 
Zac Brown Band is capable when Zac Brown is in 
the right headspace. It also provides context for 
the rest of the album by showing what got him in 
the wrong headspace — his heartbreak at the end 
of his marriage.
“Everything we lose / will be a gift in time” he 
sings, and I agree. But it’s obvious this time hasn’t 
come yet for Zac Brown.

Who hurt Zac Brown?

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Mozart’s “Requiem.” Mahler’s “5th Symphony.” Glass’s 
“Glassworks.” Davis’s “Kind of Blue.” All of these pieces of 
music have proved to be seminal works that have proved to 
influence the shape of music yet to come. It’s common to see 
them performed live by different symphonies, chamber groups 
or jazz combos. However, despite being the spark that began the 
ambient movement of music, Brian Eno’s Ambient 1: Music For 
Airports is rarely heard outside of a prerecorded context. The 
Digital Music Ensemble hopes to change that. 
Stephen Rush, the director of the the University of Michigan’s 
Digital Music Ensemble (DME), compares Eno’s Music For 
Airports to Beethoven’s 9th Symphony. “It’s not that hard to 
see live,” Rush said of the Symphony in an interview with The 
Daily. “But has anyone seen Music for Airports done? This is 
a piece of music that founded a genre. And we have not seen it 
live? That’s crazy!”
Although it wasn’t his first dive into ambient music, Music for 
Airports is certainly Eno’s most popular and influential work. 
In the winter of 1975, right after he released his critically-
acclaimed art rock album, Another Green World, Eno took a 
sharp turn in the opposite direction with his first ambient 
album, Discreet Music. This album proved to be a teaser for 
what was to come three years later with Ambient 1: Music for 
Airports.
After waiting for a delayed flight in a European airport, Eno 
was inspired by the soundscape he heard. 
“Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of 
listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must 
be as ignorable as it is interesting,” Eno said. Eno accomplished 
this through a series of tape loops — tape that has been spliced 
together to create a seemingly infinite loop that continuously 
repeats itself. Eno originally recorded the piece by phasing in 
and out tape loops of different lengths, using a variety of sounds 
from instruments like piano, voice and even synthesizer.
Just like the original piece, the Digital Music Ensemble 
plans on recreating the album through tape. Although Rush 
wrote that the group plans on recreating the piece as closely 
as possible, he also chose to make the piece more of their own. 
“I asked all of the students to write their own loops to place 

or play over the original music,” Rush wrote. “People that love 
the original may be disappointed because they will hear it (the 
original piece), but they will also hear what our students have 
placed over the top. The main thing that is different, of course, 
is that this is a physical installation … not an LP record.”
The official title of the group’s performance is “Pond Music 
XVII: Brian Eno’s Music for Airports.” In the past, the ensemble 
has done a variety of performances on the pond by the Earl V. 
Moore School of Music, each serving as more of an installation 
than a performance. While the pond doesn’t directly play a role 
in making the music, Rush says that it plays an integral role in 
the installation. 

“The pond provides a beautiful natural landscape. It is also a 
neutral gathering space for music. No one has any expectations 
of what music would come from a pond space,” Rush wrote. 
“It also messes with the audiences notion of time. When is the 
piece over? When does it start? Most of it really doesn’t matter 
with 40 hours of installation time. Just sit and listen, or walk by 
and notice.” The group spent time installing airplane propellers 
on the pond in order, spinning and mimicking the tape loops in 
order to visually accompany the music. 
The Digital Music Ensemble will present four performances 
of “Pond Music XVII: Brian Eno’s Music for Airports” on Oct. 
24 through 27, starting at noon on the Pond near the Earl V. 
Moore School of Music. Admission is free, and the public is 
welcome to come and go as they please.

Johnny Beecher settling in faster than expected

There were 46 seconds left 
on the clock. Michigan led, 
4-3, but Lake Superior State 
was pressuring after pulling its 
goaltender for an extra attacker. 
If the Wolverines could get the 
puck cleared out of their zone, it 
would likely seal a sweep over the 
Lakers.
In that high-pressure situation, 
where a faceoff win could mean 
the difference between victory 
and defeat, Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson had a decision to make. 
Seconds 
later, 
6-foot-3 
freshman 
forward 
Johnny 
Beecher glided into the faceoff 
circle to take the draw against 
6-foot-6 
forward 
Hampus 
Eriksson. As the referee dropped 
the puck, Beecher beat Eriksson 
to the puck, twisting as he sent 
it back between his legs to senior 
defenseman Luke Martin, who 
waited in the corner.
Martin brought the puck up 
toward the blueline, looking to 
get the clear or put the puck in the 
empty net, but forward Ashton 
Calder was waiting to keep it in 
the zone for his 
team 
and 
his 
play created two 
scoring chances 
for Lake Superior 
State. 
After 
a 
flurry of activity 
in front of the 
net, 
sophomore 
goaltender 
Strauss 
Mann 
covered the puck, 
which 
meant 
another faceoff was coming.
This time, there were just nine 
seconds left. Once again, Pearson 
gave Beecher the nod. Once 
again, Beecher won the draw.
“You just kinda have to dial it in 
and focus on the draw,” Beecher 
said after the game. “Obviously, 
there’s a lot on the line with a 
one-goal lead, but I’m extremely 
happy that coach has that much 
faith in me and my teammates as 
well. I just wanted to go out there 

and try to win the draw for them.”
The second time, Beecher 
beat Calder off the drop and 
sent the puck out and around 
the corner, where sophomore 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
chased it down. Blankenburg’s 
pass around the boards came up 
to senior forward Will Lockwood 
at the point, who ensured a game-
winning clear for 
the Wolverines.
“(Beecher) 
was really good, 
we 
tried 
him 
there and he’s 
been excellent,” 
Pearson said after 
the game. “Two 
big 
important 
faceoffs, and we 
win them. But 
we got to make 
sure we get those out though, 
especially the first one. But got a 
lot of confidence in Johnny in his 
faceoff ability.”
Just four games into his 
Michigan 
career, 
Beecher’s 
earned Pearson’s full confidence 
to win crucial draws at key 
moments of the game — and 
Beecher’s 16-of-20 record on 
draws 
throughout 
Saturday’s 
game exemplifies why Pearson 
trusts him implicitly.

But he didn’t always expect to 
be turning to Beecher this early 
in his career. Earlier in October, 
Pearson told MIHockey.com that 
he thought it would take Beecher 
time to adjust to college hockey.
In his two years at the U.S. 
National 
Team 
Development 
Program, Beecher was somewhat 
buried on the line chart behind 
future 
top-
five picks Jack 
Hughes 
and 
Alex 
Turcotte. 
His role wasn’t 
to be the go-to 
scorer — Hughes 
and 
Turcotte 
and 
their 
linemates 
were 
there for that. 
At 
Michigan, 
Beecher’s role is 
expanding, and Pearson thought 
it would be a month or two before 
Beecher — the No. 30 overall pick 
to the Boston Bruins in the 2019 
NHL Draft — fully adjusted.
But with three points in his 
first four games, it’s clear that 
Beecher is settling in faster than 
anyone expected.
“He’s got a quick learning 
curve,” Pearson said Monday. 
“He’s picked a lot of things up. … 
His practice habits have gotten 

better. I think that’s the biggest 
area we’ve seen and then that’s 
flown into — just flow right into 
the game with his preparation 
and whatnot.
“Practice, it took him a while to 
get going, and now he’s practicing 
better. He sees the importance 
of it and understands, and that’s 
part of the learning curve, too.”
And Beecher’s 
teammates 
can 
also 
see 
and 
appreciate 
how 
quickly 
he’s 
adjusted to the 
pace and style of 
play in college 
hockey.
“I 
don’t 
think 
it 
really 
took 
much,” 
Lockwood said. 
“I think he kinda jumped right in 
and has been great. He really uses 
his speed well. In practice, he 
wasn’t always utilizing that, but 
in games, he was blowing by guys. 
I think the first couple games he 
was a bounce or two away from 
having three, four breakaways 
and then this past weekend, I 
think he did have three or four 
breakaways.
“He’s been able to jump and do 
really well.”

Michigan women take fourth place

As the sound of the gun 
pierced the fall air and sent 
a 
flurry 
of 
runners 
into 
the 
opening 
straight, 
the 
Wolverines clad in pink ran 
to battle against some of the 
nation’s top programs.
The No. 5 Michigan women’s 
cross country 
team 
took 
fourth 
place 
out of 37 teams, 
only losing to 
the other three 
top-10 
teams 
that 
were 
present at the 
meet: 
No. 
7 
Washington, 
No. 3 BYU, and 
No. 6 Colorado. 
It was a strong performance 
from the Wolverines, but still 
wasn’t enough, as they were 80 
points off first place and never 
truly in contention for the 
team title.
“We’re satisfied, but at the 
same time looking to improve,” 
said Michigan coach Mike 
McGuire.
The main problem for the 
Wolverines was the back half 
of their top five not moving 

up enough. Their top runner, 
freshman Erika VanderLende 
— who ran the second-fastest 
time for a freshman at this 
course in the meet’s history — 
came in fifth, but their second 
runner, junior Kathryn House, 
came in 31 seconds later in 
31st 
place. 
In 
comparison, 
the 
winning 
team 
— 
the 
Washington Huskies — put 
their entire top 
five 
ahead 
of 
House. Michigan 
did tie for the 
most in the meet 
with six runners 
in the top 50, but 
nearly all of that 
depth was near 
the back of that 
group.
“Our 
key 
is 
gonna 
be 
our depth moving up a bit,” 
McGuire said.
However, this doesn’t mean 
that depth is a problem — in 
fact it is one of the Wolverines’ 
strong suits. In the open race, 
where Michigan used their 
runners not in the top seven, 
they showcased this with a 
one-two finish, and put five 
runners in the top seven. 
“I thought the performances 
we had in the open race put us 

in a good position going into 
Big Tens,” McGuire said.
And, with the regular season 
coming to a close, giving way 
to the November postseason, 
all of the Wolverines’ goals are 
still attainable. McGuire hopes 
that the team will hit its stride 
once the postseason hits.
“We’re happy with the 12 
we had today,” McGuire said. 
“We’ll continue to build on 
that.”
The race did see some very 
strong individual performances 
as well. VanderLende held the 
lead up until the last kilometer, 
senior 
Anna 
West 
raced 
competitively for the first time 
this season, and junior Jenna 
Metwalli had what McGuire 
labeled a “career performance” 
— coming in 43rd and besting 
her 6k personal record by 26 
seconds.
As Michigan looks ahead to 
the EMU Fall Classic on Friday 
and beyond, they know what 
they have to work on as a team 
before they can reach their 
goals. 
“We’re 
excited 
for 
the 
opportunity that’s presented 
to us going forward,” McGuire 
said.
And what an opportunity 
that is.

Wolverines’ practice competition 
intense after offseason departures

Charles Matthews, Jordan 
Poole and Ignas Brazdeikis. 
If 
you 
followed 
Michigan 
basketball at all last season, 
those three names probably ring 
a bell. 
Names like Brandon Johns Jr., 
David DeJulius, Adrien Nunez 
and Franz Wagner likely don’t, 
at least not to the same degree. 
And yet, some combination of 
this youthful quartet, the first 
three all sophomores and the 
last a true freshman, will feature 
significantly for the Wolverines 
this year. The departures of 
Matthews, Poole and Brazdeikis 
— who together accounted for 
56 percent of Michigan’s scoring 
last season — make it so. 
“We’re ready to step up to that 
challenge,” DeJulius, a guard, 
said. “It’s big shoes to fill losing 
those three. We understand that 
and are mature enough to know 
that. All of us are just locked in 
to fill those big shoes.”
Roster turnover is an intrinsic 
part of college athletics — 
basketball especially — but losing 
three starters to the professional 
ranks, all of whom had eligibility 
remaining, came as a bit of a 
surprise for the Wolverines. 
As the saying goes though: 
when one door closes another one 
opens. Let’s just say that door is 
gaping.
Especially with the recent 
news 
that 
Wagner, 
who’s 
received the most praise of 
anyone early on, suffered a non-
surgical fracture in his right 
wrist this week and is set to miss 
four to six weeks. 
On the perimeter, there will 
likely be two starting positions 
up for grabs between senior 
point guard Zavier Simpson and 
junior forward Isaiah Livers — 
who primarily played the ‘4’ last 
season. So far in practice, the 
aforementioned young guns and 
junior point guard Eli Brooks are 
all in the battle. 
“There’s always competition, 
especially when there’s a sudden 
change,” Brooks said. “You just 

gotta do your job. You wanna 
be the best teammate you can 
be because at the end of the day, 
they’re still on your team. You 
have to just let the better player 
get the job.” 
While Brooks has the most 
playing experience of that group, 
he hasn’t been much of a scoring 
threat throughout his career, 
averaging just 2.2 points per 
game. Brooks knows that and 
has tried to focus on it in the 
offseason. 
“One thing I lacked was 
offensive production,” Brooks 
said. “So I’ve been looking for 
my shot more, getting to spots 
where I’m comfortable at and 
being more aggressive.”
Regardless 
of 
Brooks’ 
expected 
improvements, 
DeJulius and Nunez pose a 
significant threat to his playing 
time. 
DeJulius 
featured 
in 
25 games last season and has 
impressed new coach Juwan 
Howard with his work ethic. 
“He’s like (Simpson) in so 
many ways,” Howard said. 
Nunez, who was left on the 
outside looking in last season, 
is also trying to make a leap 
forward this season with his 
sharpshooting ability being his 
biggest asset. 
Both Johns Jr. and Wagner 
are natural scorers who are more 
than capable of slotting into the 
starting lineup this season, too. 
Johns Jr. played in all 28 games 
last season, flashing his offensive 
potential in an eight-point, eight-
rebound performance against 

Indiana in early January.
“Brandon is a very athletic guy 
who has a beautiful stroke in his 
jumpshot,” Howard said. “He’s 
been competing hard in practice. 
He’s grasping a lot of the new 
responsibilities in teaching what 
is asked of him. I see that he’s 
gonna have his chance to play a 
lot this year, but as he knows, it 
starts in practice. You gotta earn 
your minutes.”
Wagner’s temporary absence 
will put even more of an onus on 
his teammates, like DeJulius and 
Johns Jr. to pick up the slack. The 
freshman played professionally 
in his native Germany as an 
18-year old last season. His 
polished offensive game, sneaky 
athleticism and maturity have 
been major talking points thus 
far. Upon his return, look for 
Wagner to eventually crack the 
primary rotation. 
Until 
then, 
the 
fierce 
competition that characterized 
practice will be even more 
important. That relentless drive 
to improve is just what Howard 
wants from his team though. 
“Coach said that any drill 
we do, where we’re trying to 
compete, is like the Hunger 
Games,” Nunez said. “At the 
end of the day, we’re all family 
and teammates. When it gets on 
the court though, we’re all just 
trying to compete and earn that 
spot. 
“It’s 
all 
just 
healthy 
competition but whoever is the 
hungriest is gonna be the one 
who plays in the end.”

Defense spurs victory

As the No. 9 Michigan women’s 
field hockey team took the field 
Friday night, the lyrics of Queen’s 
We Will Rock You blasted through 
Ocker Field. 
The song proved a fitting 
backdrop to the type of match that 
followed: a smashmouth, defensive 
slugfest. For the Wolverines (11-3 
overall, 4-1 Big Ten), it was a team 
effort on the defensive end that 
ushered them to a 1-0 victory over 
No. 2 Maryland (13-2, 5-1). 
“We just worked as a team 
together,” 
said 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Anna 
Spieker. 
“Everybody knew exactly where 
they were supposed to be, in their 
right pockets and having a good 
angle with the ball.”
Throughout the game, the 
Wolverines’ press was relentless 
and aggressive, often forcing 
Maryland into sloppy play and 
rushed passes. 
“It all starts with the forwards,” 
said senior midfielder Guadalupe 
Fernandez Lacort. “The forwards, 
they had a great press. You would 
see their sidebacks fumble the ball 
or hesitate, not knowing what to 
do. It really all started from there.”
Limiting 
Maryland’s 
corner 
opportunities 
also 
keyed 
the 
defense. The Terrapins are known 
for having a robust corner game, 
led by two standout drag flickers, 
forwards 
Bibi 
Donraadt 
and 
Jen Bleakney. With Michigan’s 
press 
helping 
keep 
the 
ball 
predominantly in the Wolverines’ 

possession, 
Maryland 
only 
managed to create three corners.
When 
the 
Terrapins 
did 
slip through the cracks in the 
Michigan defense, Spieker was 
there to thwart any notion of a goal. 
Despite facing ten shots, Spieker, 
the anchor to the Wolverines’ 
defense, ensured none reached 
the back of the net by recording 
four saves. The shutout helped her 
improve upon her nation-leading 
.75 goals against average. 
“She made really solid, poised 
decisions 
back 
there,” 
said 
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz. 
“Obviously she shut them out, and 
that’s not an easy team to shut out. 
So it was a great game from her.”
Michigan 
was 
humming 
defensively from the very start, 
allowing no shots and no corners 
in the first quarter. Any doubt that 
the Wolverines would lose the 
intensity and physical play for the 
remaining 45 minutes gradually 
washed away as the game went on. 
Stout defensive performances 
are nothing new for this Michigan 
squad — the team now has eight 
shutouts on the season. Yet doing 
it against a Maryland team that 
entered the match eighth in the 
nation with 3.29 goals per game 
is an impressive reminder of the 
team’s 
defensive 
capabilities 
moving forward.
“They 
played 
60 
minutes 
tonight,” Pankratz said. “That’s 
one of the goals we’ve had all 
season, to play an entire 60 
minutes really strong. We know 
we had to against Maryland, and 
they did.”

Franz Wagner out 4-6 
weeks with wrist injury

Michigan freshman wing 
Franz Wagner will miss the 
next four-to-six weeks with 
a non-surgical fracture to his 
right wrist, according to a 
Michigan spokesperson.
“While this is an unfortunate 
situation for Franz, we know 
he will make his return as 
soon as he is able,” Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard said in a 
statement. “We have the finest 
medical staff and trainers at 
Michigan so we know he is in 
good hands.”
While Wagner is expected 
to make a full recovery, the 
news comes at a particularly 
poor time for the Wolverines. 
Wagner 
was 
expected 
to 
bring immediate offense to a 
Michigan team that lost Ignas 
Brazdeikis, Jordan Poole and 
Charles Matthews, a trio that 
combined for over half of 
the team’s scoring last year, 
to early departures in the 
offseason. Now, it becomes 
crucial to make sure the wrist 
fracture doesn’t become a 
lingering injury capable of 
limiting 
Wagner’s 
shooting 
abilities 
throughout 
the 
season.
At 
6-foot-8, 
Wagner 
provides a rare combination 
of size and skill for a player 
capable of creating his own 
shot. At Big Ten Media Day on 
Oct. 2, Howard lauded such 
abilities.
“Franz is talented,” Howard 
said. “Franz is a big, huge 
pickup for us. In my opinion, 
if Franz lived in the U.S. he’d 
be the equivalent of what 
today’s players are rated five-
star — he’s that good. And to 
be almost 6-foot-9 at a wing 
position, he has a high IQ. He’s 
tough, he’s skilled. He can put 
the ball on the floor, create his 
own shot, and he’s not afraid 
to dunk on you.
“One thing I did not mention 
which I should’ve mentioned 
first was he’s an underrated 

defender. We all talk about his 
skill level offensively, but the 
guy can defend. He wants to 
defend, and that’s the beauty 
of Franz. He’s going to be a 
pro.”
If the timetable holds, it 
appears the Wolverines will 
be 
without 
their 
highly-
touted 
freshman 
until 
sometime around the team’s 
trip to Atlantis during the 
week 
of 
Thanksgiving. 
Wagner’s return would be a 
crucial boost with potential 
matchups against teams like 
North Carolina, Alabama and 
Gonzaga.

S

moke still drifted over 
the field at Beaver Sta-
dium, a remnant of the 
pregame fireworks show. Fans 
clad all in white raised their 
pom-poms in unison, scream-
ing as Penn 
State play-
ers gestured 
to get even 
louder. 
Amidst the 
commotion, 
Michigan 
took the field.
Before 
running a 
single play, 
the Wolver-
ines took a timeout, and every-
one who’d seen Michigan play 
a game in the past five years 
said, “Here we go again.”
This team is known for going 
on the road and playing scared, 
and on that front, coach Jim 
Harbaugh is guilty until prov-
en innocent.
In previous games, that’s 
manifested itself in the team 
completely crumbling after 
allowing an early score — like 
at Wisconsin, when it was 35-0 
by halftime after the Badgers 
scored on their first posses-
sion.
But that’s not what hap-
pened Saturday, at least not 
quite.
This time, the players did 
about as much as you could’ve 
asked for after a slow start. 
Instead, it was Harbaugh and 
offensive coordinator Josh 
Gattis who panicked.
The Wolverines put together 
a first drive that was surpris-
ingly good. Junior wide receiv-
ers Nico Collins and Tarik 
Black each had a catch — Col-
lins’ for 17 yards and Black’s 
for seven. Senior quarterback 
Shea Patterson kept the ball 
himself on a read for two more 
after criticism he hadn’t done 
so enough.
Michigan stared the white-
out right in the face and drove 

into the Nittany Lions’ territo-
ry. For a minute, it looked like 
an offense that maybe really 
was hitting its stride.
It was fourth-and-1 from 
Penn State’s 47, the perfect 
time to be bold. The Wolver-
ines could’ve sent a message 
that their pregame jitters 
were over, that the narratives 
weren’t true this time, that 
they were here to win.
Instead, the punt team came 
on the field.
“We were playing for field 
position, and we wanted to get 
the ball put inside the 15 or 
10-yard line,” Harbaugh said. 
“Unfortunately, it went into 
the end zone.”
Playing for field position can 
be a legitimate strategy, but it’s 
one you use when you’re play-
ing a team like Iowa, one that 
struggles to string big plays 
together. It’s what you do with 

a game you expect to be a 10-3 
slog.
Anyone who thought that 
was where Saturday’s game 
was headed was deluding 
themselves. Penn State runs 
a pro-spread offense and has 
a playmaking receiver in KJ 
Hamler, who has at least one 
catch of 20-plus yards in every 
game this season. On Saturday 
alone, the Nittany Lions hit 
six plays for 15 or more yards. 
Against a team that moves the 
ball like that, field position 
doesn’t mean a lick.
Statistically, fourth-and-1 
conversion rates are pretty 
high — Michigan did it itself 
with a Patterson quarterback 
sneak in the fourth quarter. A 
2017 Football Study Hall report 
concluded that in college foot-
ball, with just one yard to gain, 
it’s better to go for it than punt 
anywhere past a team’s own 43.

But decisions like this aren’t 
just about the analytics. Har-
baugh’s been preaching all sea-
son that the offense was better 
than anyone had seen. Going 
for it would’ve been a manifes-
tation of everything he’s been 
saying. Last week against the 
Illini, he did just that, convert-
ing a fourth-and-2 quarterback 
run in the fourth quarter that 
turned into a touchdown.
“We all knew that we want-
ed to get the first down and 
end the game on our terms,” 
Bell said of the Illinois game. It 
follows that Michigan would’ve 
wanted to start a game on its 
own terms, too.
One playcalling decision 
probably wouldn’t have been 
make-or-break, and the truth 
is, the Wolverines probably 
wouldn’t have scored a touch-
down on that first drive. But 
at the end of the first half — 

after they had found the end 
zone and cut the deficit to two 
scores — Harbaugh opted to try 
a 58-yard field goal with Jake 
Moody instead of going for it 
on fourth-and-6. (He missed). 
Then, in the third quarter, Pat-
terson appeared visibly frus-
trated when Harbaugh opted to 
punt on fourth-and-3 from the 
50. (Michigan scored a touch-
down on its next possession.)
“Thought we could make it,” 
Harbaugh said of the field goal 
attempt after the game. “Right 
at that line where we could 
make it and it’s a long field 
goal. It was that or go for it on 
fourth down, so we decided to 
kick the field goal.”
Yes, it was fourth-and-6. 
But Moody, while gener-
ally reliable, has never made 
a field goal longer than 48 
yards. If the Wolverines were 
still playing for field posi-

tion, kicking was probably the 
riskiest choice — and without 
the upside of rejuvenating the 
offense’s confidence.
In his Monday press con-
ference, Harbaugh extolled 
Patterson’s virtues, calling 
his performance against Penn 
State “heroic” and reaffirming 
that he’d seen that potential all 
season.
“He’s excited about it, being 
in that atmosphere and playing 
that type of game,” Harbaugh 
said. “You could sense it from 
everything about him.”
And after Patterson had his 
best game of the season in the 
toughest possible environment, 
it was easy to believe. Except 
that, on the sidelines of Beaver 
Stadium, Harbaugh didn’t act 
like a coach who could sense 
Patterson’s enthusiasm.
Instead, he acted like a 
coach who was scared, who 
was doing damage control 
before there was any damage 
to speak of.
There is, of course, blame 
to go around for Saturday. 
The defense gave up too many 
big plays. Bell wasn’t the only 
wideout with a crucial drop. 
Patterson threw a costly 
interception on a screen pass 
attempt.
But on a day when the 
offense bucked the trend and 
fought back, a day when it 
showed that — at least after a 
shaky beginning — it wasn’t 
scared, Harbaugh seemed 
to abandon the trust he’d so 
steadfastly preached.
Sure, Michigan didn’t make 
the most of its chances until it 
was too late. But facing his best 
opportunity yet for the elusive 
big road win, Harbaugh didn’t 
give his team nearly enough of 
them.
Maybe he was the one rat-
tled by the lights.

Seniors grappling with reset goals after PSU loss

Ben 
Bredeson 
situated 
himself at the center of a media 
scrum Monday afternoon, an 
expressionless look plastered to his 
face beneath a low-riding trucker 
hat.
The first question was as simple 
as it was predictable: What are 
your goals for the rest of season? 
Implicit in the question was that 
the goals Michigan carried into the 
season — win the Big Ten and make 
the College Football Playoff, at a 
minimum — are bust, evaporated 
in the familiar pitfall of road losses 
to ranked teams.
Bredeson, a captain and one 
of Michigan’s unofficial senior 
spokesmen, 
stared 
into 
the 
surrounding cameras and provided 
the diplomatic answer.
“We’re just taking it week by 
week,” Bredeson said. “We can’t 
control anything other than our 
own play so just focusing on that is 
the next step.”
Minutes later, defensive tackle 
Carlo Kemp — another one of those 
captains and spokesmen — echoed 

Bredeson. “Yes, we lost, but you 
gotta remember, this wasn’t our 
last game of the year,” Kemp said 
“This isn’t, ‘Alright, we’re done, 
let’s start packing up.’ ”
Neither will say it, because that 
would undermine the significance 
of the season’s final five games, but 
both know their senior seasons 
will end without achieving their 
ultimate goals. 
Bredeson chose the Wolverines 
despite 
offers 
from 
Alabama, 
Oklahoma and Ohio State. Kemp 
could have gone to Notre Dame or 
Wisconsin, calling Michigan an 
opportunity to play “top-caliber 
football” when he committed. Yet, 
both will finish their collegiate 
careers without an appearance in 
the Big Ten championship game 
or College Football Playoff, unless 
Kemp successfully petitions for a 
retroactive redshirt.
Those goals — repeated ad 
nauseam through the offseason 
— are so entrenched in the 
Wolverines’ 
self-identity 
that 
redshirt 
freshman 
linebacker 
Cam McGrone promised a Big Ten 
championship game rematch with 
Wisconsin after last month’s 35-14 

loss in Madison. “I know when 
we see them again, we’re going 
to smack them in the mouth,” 
McGrone said at the time.
That 
same 
week, 
VIPER 
Khaleke Hudson — another senior 
captain often paraded in front of 
the media — was more cautious, 
but still delivered a message of 
confidence rooted in controlling 
their own destiny. “We still are able 
to reach our goals that we had for 
the whole season,” Hudson said.
Not anymore.
Now, the only mention of 
expectations is to dismiss them. 
“Win our next game, that’s our 
goal,” Jim Harbaugh said, when 
asked how he defines a successful 
season.
“Expectations, those are just 
outcomes,” Kemp said. “And you 
start focusing on expectations, like 
‘we were supposed to do this, we 
were supposed to do that’ — none 
of that really matters.” 
The message stands in direct 
contrast to everything that was said 
all offseason, through Wisconsin’s 
rout and up to Saturday night’s 
28-21 loss to Penn State.
That loss, featuring a spirited 

fight back from a 21-0 deficit, 
proved Michigan with its latest 
reason for optimism. Built into 
that optimism is that whatever the 
Wolverines do over the next five 
weeks carries into next year — for 
everyone except the seniors.
It’s why Bredeson, Kemp and the 
rest of those seniors have turned 
to using their experience to help 
keep Michigan’s underclassmen 
grounded.
“Worrying 
about 
Big 
Ten 

championship, 
National 

Championship, really the only 
thing you can control is the next 
game,” Bredeson said. “So just 
trying to help them see that and see 
there’s still a lot of great things that 
we can attain this season.”
Asked whether that’s hard to 
grapple with as a senior, when 
winning those championships was 
the goal he brought to Michigan, 
Bredeson called it “part of being 
a teammate” and reaffirmed his 
focus on this week’s game against 
Notre Dame.
“You can’t let two losses take 
your season,” Bredeson said.
Take your season, no. Take your 
goals, well, that’s unavoidable.
