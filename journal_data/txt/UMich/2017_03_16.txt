In an effort to continue the 

building of Flint following 
its declaration of a state 
emergency 
in 
2015, 
Gov. 

Rick Snyder’s recommended 
budgetfor 
the 
2018 
fiscal 

year allocated funds toward 
multiple 
programs 
and 

initiatives within the city. The 
budget will run from Oct. 1, 
2017, to Sept. 30, 2018.

To offset the thousands 

affected by lead contamination, 
about $49 million has been 
promised to be allocated for 
Flint in the proposal. Since 
the state of emergency was 
declared, 2015 a total of $234 
million in aid has been sent 
the city. However, Rep. Dan 
Kildee (D–Flint) said while 
this continued funding is a 
step in the right direction, it is 
not a complete solution.

“The state of Michigan is 

responsible for what happened 
in Flint and we need their 
long-term 
commitment,” 

Kildee said. “They spend some 
money and treat it as if they 
have solved the problem. The 
real question is whether it’s 
enough, and so far it’s not.”

In order to support the 

drinking 
water 
declaration 

of emergency in Flint, $25 
million of the total $49 million 
has been allocated to address 
the emergency state. If the 
proposal receives legislative 
approval, the funding will be 

available to Flint residents 
as needed. Though this state 
funding is appreciated and 
necessary, 
state 
Sen. 
Jim 

Ananich (D–Flint) noted the 
programs that have appeared 
more successful have been 
community efforts and ideas.

“There’s been a number 

positive solutions that the 
community helped develop,” 
Ananich said. “Lansing caused 
the problem, and I think they 

need to let Flint come up with 
the proper solutions.” 

Though 
Kildee 

acknowledged Flint has an 
inevitably 
slow 
recovery 

ahead, 
largely 
because 
of 

the long-term effects of lead 
poisoning, the state needs to 
expedite the recovery process 
as much as possible.

“All of the improvements 

that have taken place are good 
but are too slow,” Kildee said. 

“The state does not have a 
sense of urgency — the most 
positive thing about Flint is 
that the people of Flint haven’t 
given up.”

Ananich also mentioned the 

long-term nature of the water 
crisis and the problems that 
causes for both the people and 
the budget.

While women are rising to 

equality in most fields, a seminar 
hosted 
by 
Central 
Student 

Government 
Wednesday 

evening 
discussed 
the 
fact 

that women remain a distinct 
minority within technology and 
the sciences.

LSA junior Olivia Luciani, 

one of two event organizers, 
alongside Engineering freshman 
Julia 
O’Sullivan, 
expressed 

the importance of this topic 
and why she was inspired to 
coordinate the event.

“Visibility 
of 
women 
in 

technology 
and 
dialogues 

around diversity in computer 
science are both very important, 
at Michigan and nationwide,” 
Luciani said. “Women have 
made huge strides in tech 
industries over the past 50 years, 
but there are still perceptions 
some hold that pose unique 
challenges to women and may 
stand in the way of true gender 
parity in the workplace.”

Keysha Wall and Lauren Kay, 

if elected in the upcoming Central 
Student 
Government 
elections, 

hope to use their positions to amplify 
the voices of minority students 
on campus to the University of 
Michigan administration. Wall, an 
Art & Design senior, and Kay, an LSA 
senior, are running for president and 
vice president, respectively, with the 
Defend Affirmative Action Party, 
the University’s longest-standing 
student political party.

Though the party has not won 

the executive ticket in recent 
years, 
DAAP’s 
preliminary 

platform consists of a long list of 
policies focusing on issues such as 
minority enrollment, expanding 
rights for undocumented students 
and other marginalized groups 
on campus, and mental health, 
among others.

DAAP is the political arm of the 

larger local group BAMN, which 
fights for affirmative action, 
integration 
and 
immigration 

rights.

Though several institutions 

and officials serve as agents 
in supporting the community 
of people with disabilities on 
campus at the University of 
Michigan, those in it still face 
daily hurdles. Many resources, 
students object, fall short of 
inclusion. Furthermore, much 
of 
the 
conversation 
around 

marginalization — students and 
staff agree — fails to consider the 
experiences of individuals with 
disabilities.

The perks and pitfalls of 

registration

Services for Students with 

Disabilities is the University’s 
central 
office 
with 
which 

students who have disabilities 
can register. It helps provide 
accommodations and access for 
students academically and in 
other capacities on campus.

The office’s annual report 

from the 2015-16 school year 
shows 
a 
record 
832 
newly 

registered students — more than 

100 students higher than the 
previous year — and an overall 
registration of 2,277 students. Of 
students registered with SSD, 40 
percent have learning disabilities, 
26 percent have mental-health 
conditions and 15 percent have 
chronic-health conditions.

The 
office’s 
primary 
role, 

once students register, is to 
provide students with a Verified 
Individualized 
Services 
and 

Accommodations 
letter 
to 

compensate 
for 
a 
student’s 

disability. Students then provide 
these letters to professors — 
generally early on in the school 
year — so accommodations can be 
made for them in terms of testing, 
absences and other portions of the 
class. 

However, according to SSD 

Director Stuart Segal, the office 
can only go so far in terms of 
assisting students.

“We don’t have the ability to 

make any fundamental alterations 
in a classroom, a curriculum, or a 
program of study that leads to 
certification or licensing,” he said. 
“Students have to be able to do

Administration announces plans to roll back emissions standards, cut EPA funding

As wind speeds surged and 

temperatures 
plummeted 

Wednesday afternoon, activists 
gathered near the Willow Run 
manufacturing 
complex 
in 

Ypsilanti to protest President 
Donald Trump’s arrival and 
speech in the city.

With just two days’ notice of 

the presidential visit, several 
grassroots organizations from 
the community organized the 

protest. Despite the lack of time 
available, they still managed 
to draw a crowd of about 400 
people.

Michelle Deatrick, vice chair 

of 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 

Board of Commissioners and 
co-founder 
of 
Michigan 
to 

Believe In, stressed the event 
was a collaboration between 
many groups.

“I had the honor of getting to 

help organize, along with a lot 
of other people,” she said. “It 
shouldn’t be just one voice, not 
just my organization, Michigan 

to Believe In, it needs to be many 
… it couldn’t just be one middle-
aged white woman’s voice

Trump arrived at Willow 

Run — the future site for the 
American Center for Mobility’s 
autonomous 
and 
connected 

vehicle-testing facility — to hold 
a roundtable with executives 
from the automotive industry 
and speak to select employees. 
During 
the 
speech, 
he 

announced plans to review the 
EPA’s auto-emissions standards, 
and roll back restrictions he 
deems unnecessary.

The Michigan Daily was not 

granted credentials to Trump’s 
speech.

The protest took place on 

one side of Airplane Road, 
just outside the Willow Run 
facilities. On the other side 
of the road stood a handful of 
Trump supporters, who came to 
counter the protest with a large 
float sporting Trump signs and 
American flags.

whatever the requirements are of 
whatever class or program they’re 
in.”

Specifically, the SSD cannot 

alter components of the course 
— including attendance, grades 
and 
homework 
obligations 

that are outlined in syllabi — 
to 
accommodate 
students. 

Additionally, students in certain 
programs that lead to certification 
or licensing must abide by the rules 
of the program as it was designed. 
Students can ask for adjustments 
themselves, but it is up to the 
discretion of their professor or 
supervisor to agree.

Art & Design freshman Celeste 

Adams recently registered with 
the office, but does not entirely 
agree with its tactics. Adams uses a 
power chair.

“I get why (the SSD office) is 

important and how helpful it is, 
but I think there are a lot of issues 
with it,” she said. “If you look at any 
history of any minority, having to 
register to prove you’re part of that 
group isn’t something that has been 

appropriate (or has gone well).”

She pointed out a teacher 

in one of her classes recently 
accommodated another student 
who will be absent from class for 
the upcoming Jewish holidays 
without documentation.

“She doesn’t have to prove that 

she’s Jewish,” Adams said. “I was 
told by a teacher last semester that 
she was unable to give me any 
accommodation unless I had proof 
through the SSD, even though 
it’s pretty obvious that I have a 
disability.”

Adams went on to explain the 

incident led to a conflict in the class 
before she registered with SSD. 
The teacher threatened to fail her 
and then told her that people like 
her, with disabilities, shouldn’t be 
allowed to go to college.

“It just seems like for some 

reason 
with 
the 
disabled 

community, whenever we need 
stuff we have to prove it,” she said.

Adams explained some argue 

people could manipulate the system 
by lying they have disabilities 
when they don’t in order to get 
accommodations.

“It’s never made sense to me that 

we have to go through proving our 
own identities and the fact that 

we need certain things because 
someone might lie about it, which 
in reality doesn’t really happen,” 
she said. “If it does, that’s when the 
University needs to reflect and say, 
‘Ok, are we pushing our students 
too much?’ ”

Adams noted students do not 

have to register with the SSD, 
but if they don’t, it is up to the 
discretion of teachers to offer 
accommodations. The difference, 
she said, can sometimes be between 
passing and failing a class.

Engineering 
junior 
Drew 

Canada 
wrote 
in 
an 
email 

interview he has had a positive 
experience with teachers in the 
College of Engineering, but not 
to the same degree in LSA. He is 
also registered with SSD for his 
muscular dystrophy.

“(The College of Engineering 

is) very empathetic of my health 
issues and have easily rescheduled 
exams for me,” he wrote. “Large 
LSA classes (like Calc 1-3) were 
less accommodating and couldn’t 
reschedule exams due to the lack of 
a doctors note. With my Muscular 
Dystrophy, I have all the medical 
equipment in my dorm to treat 
my health issues except to an IV. 
Things can get pretty bad even 

without a doctor / hospital 
visit. The CoE profs I’ve had 
understand that while even 
though the LSA teachers might 
understand as well, they haven’t 
given the same support.”

Architecture 
graduate 

student 
Mieko 
Preston 

experienced a stroke five years 
ago and now uses a medical 
scooter. She said registering 
with the SSD was an “uphill 
battle” and she did almost as 
much paperwork to register 
with the University as she did to 
receive government assistance.

“The accessibility of being 

able to benefit from those 
accommodations or resources 
that are necessarily put in place 
is actually extremely difficult,” 
she said.

Building accessibility — or 

lack thereof

Students 
with 
disabilities 

also face significant barriers in 
regard to accessing buildings on 
campus.

When three students in a 2013 

Real Estate Essentials class at the 

University of Michigan Ross School 

of Business were assigned to create 

their own potential real-estate 

development deal for a final project, 

they crafted a realistic idea, with 

hopes that one day their project 

would come to life.

Four years later, the project 

that began as a simple idea in a 

University classroom is taking 

shape, as development on their 

proposed site is set to begin this 

month.

University alumni Dang Duong, 

Myles Hamby and Clarke Lewis 

dubbed their project Baltimore 

Station, with an initial goal of 

re-developing abandoned, city-

owned buildings in Detroit located 

near the historic Fisher Building.

That original group of three 

students is now adding one more 

partner to its team: Peter Allen, 

owner of an Ann Arbor-based real-

estate firm Peter Allen + Associates, 

and the same professor who taught 

them in the Real Estate Essentials 

class in 2013.

Allen noted the Baltimore 

Station project was realistic 

and affordable, making the idea 

especially promising for a student 

process.

“The new kid on the block 

for cities is Detroit,” he said in 

a Business School press release. 

“It has replaced Chicago as the 

favorite city to go to, in my mind, 

especially if you’re in real estate.”

The idea for the project came 

from the team’s general interest 

in urban planning and lifestyle. 

Though each alum specializes in 

different areas — Duong studied 

business and law, Hamby received 

a master’s in urban planning 

and Lewis studied architecture 

— they all were committed to a 

project that would be effective 

and relevant.

“I want to treat this as more 

than an academic exercise,” Hamby 

said about the project. “I want to do 

this as a real deal.”

To get its project off the ground, 

the team initially struggled finding 

adequate funding. Duong recalls 

the team made approximately 100 

pitches to investors, with none 

agreeing to invest.

When I was a kid, I loved 

American Girl dolls. They were 
just expensive dolls, but they were 
also a defining innovation of my 
entire upbringing. The historical 
dolls scene was the best — don’t 
argue. Felicity was my favorite, 
but Nellie was pretty cool and 
Molly was all right. Don’t talk to 
me about Samantha though. My 
best friend and I would spend 
hours at her house poring through 
magazine pages, picking out the 
dolls we wanted and the outfits 
we would put them in. We read all 
the books together, and made up 
our own stories once we finished 
the books. I wanted, more than 
anything, to have an American Girl 
doll. And when my best friend got 
Kit Kittredge, I was so jealous.

But here’s the thing: part of the 

attraction of American Girl dolls 
is that the doll looks like you. All 
the girls in the magazines looked 
just like their dolls. There were 
always sections in the back where 
you could customize your own 
doll so it really fit — Truly You, or 
whatever it was called. You could 
even buy matching clothes and 
pajama sets, so you know it was 
real. But my friends and I would sit 
for ages, leafing through eye colors 
and hair colors and skin tones but 
we could never come up with a 
doll that looked quite like me. A 
chubby-faced, Chinese-American 
girl.

That really messed with my 

head for a while. Especially playing 
with my friend and Kit Kittredge, 
with their matching blonde bobs, 
I wondered why I couldn’t get 
a doll that looked like me. So I 
decided I would write a letter to 
the American Girl organization. 
I saved all my Christmas money, 
all my birthday money and all 
my Chinese New Year hong bao 
(red packets of Chinese New Year 
money) for this moment. I had 
$132.74 in cash and a mission. 
I wrote to the American Girl 
organization in Chicago — with my 
best handwriting, to make it clear I 
wasn’t fucking around — to ask if 
they could make a doll that looked 
like me. A doll with little almond 
eyes that her classmates sometimes 
made fun of, and straight black 
hair that stood out among a sea of 
brunette. I put all my money into 
the envelope, figured out how to 
address an envelope and sealed my 
letter in tight.

Unfortunately, my grand plan 

was thwarted by my mom, who 
thought putting a fat stack of cash 
into an envelope was not a good 
idea. And even though I wasn’t 
happy about it, I was willing to let 
it go. It was my mom, after all.

Fast-forward 
to 
2007, 
and 

American Girl released Ivy Ling. 
I was shook. Yeah, Ivy was a Best 
Friend and not a main doll and 
she was Taiwanese, not mainland 
Chinese, so I didn’t relate to 
everything about her. But she 
looked like me, ate the same kind 
of food at home and celebrated 
Chinese New Year, like me. And 
when I say I begged for that doll, 
I’m not playing. I swear I almost 
cried when she arrived in the mail, 
with her red qipao — traditional 
Chinese dress — and black bangs. 
Finally, I had an American Girl 
Doll that looked just like me. I felt 
like I belonged.

This is the story of so many 

Asian-American girls. I spent 
so much of my childhood, and 
still spend so much time today, 
searching for women who look 
like me in outlets of my life. It’s not 
something that I would spend a lot 
of time thinking about, but I think 
its effects were more pertinent than 
I recognize. Because whenever I 
see Asian-American women like 
Constance Wu, Amy Tan or Judy 
Chu, it makes me think that I could 
be them in the future. I can make 
as much change as they have made. 
I can be successful, I have a place 
in America. For all the backlash I 
have gotten for looking the way I 
do, seeing Asian-American women 
in the eye of the public makes me 
feel as though it doesn’t matter. If 
they could make it out and keep 
chasing their dreams, I can too.

Recently, I have also been 

spending an ungodly amount of 
time explaining to people why 
Asian-American 
representation 

matters. From Facebook friends, 
class discussions and our own 
university president, I hear that 
Asians are a smaller population 
anyway. It’s an economic and 
business choice to use white 
people. Asians are better off 
compared to other minorities, 
and I need to pick my battles. 
Some Asians don’t care, so why 
should I? And when I consider 
those perspectives, it makes sense. 
Stereotypically, 
Asians 
stack 

paper, keep their mouths shut and 
fulfill the image of immigrants 
that is marketed to the rest of the 
world. But why don’t people think 
Asian-Americans have problems? 
Because I know there is unspoken 
poverty in urban Chinatowns, 
there are ignored issues among 
the Hmong population in Detroit, 
and that Jiansheng Chen, Srinivas 
Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani 
were shot unarmed this month 
and no one really cared. However, 
I have realized that people are 
only aware of the Asian-American 
statistics publicized to the rest 
of the world. They do not see 
our issues because, to them, 
Asian issues don’t exist. All they 
see are the numbers of Asians 
getting university degrees, the 
nerdy Asian sidekicks on the big 
screens, the Asian fantasy girls 
in pornography, but that is not 
the reality of the Asian-American 
experience. Although Asians are 
part of the ethnic group that is 
most likely to receive a college 
education, there exists a serious 
lack of Asian-American leadership 
in industries across the board. 
That’s not even mentioning that 
many subcategories of Asian-
Americans receive below-average 
educations — we just don’t talk 
about it.

So Asian-Americans get degrees, 

but that doesn’t mean anything 
when they leave campus if they 
want to make change in a field. 
People still want white faces to lead 
their businesses and institutions. 
And while it is a huge privilege 
to be able to receive an education 
at the university level, Asians 
still have to combat the notorious 
bamboo ceiling when they finish 
college. It all stems back to how 
Asian-Americans are perceived in 
this country. Media is a huge outlet 
for many Americans, and that is 
why accurate and multifaceted 
representation matters so much. 
It’s why Karlie Kloss dressing 
as a geisha in Vogue’s diversity 
shoot was offensive, and why 
Scarlett Johansson in “Ghost in 

the Shell” was unacceptable. If 
you really needed a model for 
a 
diversity 
shoot 
celebrating 

Japanese culture, wouldn’t it be a 
great opportunity to help Japanese 
models break into the modeling 
industry? Isn’t it more economical 
to cast an Asian actress in “Ghost 
in the Shell,” rather than try digital 
alterations on Scarlett Johansson’s 
face to make her look more Asian? 
Hearing about things like this 
makes me, as an Asian girl, feel as 
though I’m not needed in society. 
That someone can just take a white 
woman, give her an angled bob and 
call it about the same. Preferable, 
even.

I have been taught, through 

instances like these, that white 
America 
doesn’t 
want 
actual 

Asians. They want Becky to 
squint a little, and that’s more 
palatable for society. They want 
me to mispronounce my Rs and 
say things that don’t make sense, 
because English can’t possibly be 
my mother tongue. They want 
me to stir-fry rice in the corner, 
and laugh along with their jokes 
that simply aren’t true. But you 
want to know a secret? It’s not 
“ching chong,” it’s Chongqing, 
and Chongqing is a major Chinese 
municipal city with over 30 million 
people. You don’t have yellow fever, 
Chad, you have a problem with 
hypersexualizing Asian women. 
And my eyes might be smaller than 
yours, but I still somehow see more 
than you, because you can’t even 
recognize the ignorance coming 
out of your own mouth.

When I tutored kindergarteners 

a few weeks ago, I walked into the 
classroom and noticed that, while 
the classroom was quite diverse, 
there was only one Asian girl in the 
room. She noticed it, too. When she 
saw me, her eyes grew so big, they 
looked like marbles. She ran up to 
me when activities started, still in 
disbelief.

“You 
look 
like 
me,” 
she 

whispered.

“I do,” I replied.
She stayed by my side for the 

whole time I helped out in class, 
playing phonics Go Fish with all 
the kindergarteners. And when 
my time was up, her little hand 
waved goodbye, watching me with 
those big marble eyes. All I could 
think about for the rest of the day 
was the look on her face when she 
first saw me. It reminded me of my 
own inexplicable obsession with 
Selena Gomez when I was younger. 
I couldn’t put a finger on it at the 
time, but I later realized it was 
because she looked vaguely like 
me. Representation matters. When 
I see another Asian woman doing 
important things in society, it gives 
me so much hope for myself. And 
this feeling is probably applicable 
to other groups of people. Diverse 
representation is a powerful tool 
that must be harnessed to truly 
attain an inclusive society. And 
people will question, degrade, 
dismiss and push my beliefs aside, 
but I will not stand down. This is 
important, and I will push until 
people understand.

Progress comes slowly, but I 

am willing to take slow progress 
if the alternative is none. Ivy Ling 
was discontinued in 2014, but in 
February, American Girl released 
not only a new Korean-American 
doll, but also a Pacific Islander doll. 
American Girl dolls might not be 
the hypest scene for kids anymore, 
but I hope those who still care can 
learn more about those cultures, 
or find a place for them within the 
context of American Girl Dolls. 
Because if you are here in America, 
you deserve to be visible.

American Girl Doll
LSA Dean Andrew Martin 
Promotes Ignorance of Asian/
Pacific Islander Americans

STEFFI CAO
MiC Contributor

If you are worried that the 

dissemination 
of 
“alternative 

facts” is undermining intelligent 
discourse and threatening our 
democracy, we advise you to 
pay closer to attention to LSA’s 
attempts 
to 
eliminate 
and 

distort the history of Asian/
Pacific Islander Americans at the 
University of Michigan.

On March 10, LSA Dean 

Andrew Martin sent an email 
for mass distribution in which 
he announced “the first-ever 
campus-wide 
convening 
of 

students, faculty, and staff for an 
afternoon of informal meet-and-
greet networking, information 
sharing, 
and 
structured 

conversations on issues of concern 
to Asian, Asian-American, and 
Pacific 
Islander 
communities 

across campus.” 

Apparently, 
Dean 
Martin 

has just discovered the A/
PIA 
community 
the 
same 

way 
Columbus 
“discovered” 

America. 
The 
flier 
Martin 

attached says the summit will 
discuss the “History of APIAs at 
U-M.” However, his misleading 
announcement suggests this will 
be a whitewashing of history.

As members of a network 

of A/PIA alumni and former 
student leaders, we are here to 
tell Martin that our community 
has convened dozens of campus-
wide gatherings of student, staff 
and faculty for more than four 
decades. 
Not 
coincidentally, 

overcoming LSA’s lack of support 
for A/PIA Studies and lack of 
awareness of A / PIA concerns 
has been a central impetus for 
these regular convenings.

To 
erase 
the 
history 
of 

A/PIA 
organizing 
at 
the 

University is to ignore the 
collective struggles we have 
fought against Eurocentrism, 
hate crimes and institutional 

racism, 
while 
fighting 
for 

ethnic 
studies, 
affirmative 

action and social justice. This 
erasure reinforces the model 
minority stereotype of Asians as 
passive and conservative, thus 
fostering divisions between the 
A/PIA community and other 
communities of color.

In 
recent 
years, 
A/PIA 

students, 
faculty 
and 
staff 

organized a series of campus-
wide summits, conferences and 
events in response to LSA’s failure 
to retain A/PIA Studies faculty, 
which reached a crisis point 
starting in 2011. Within an eight-
month period, the United Asian 
American Organizations, the A/
PIA Studies program and Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs convened 
two summits, one strategy session, 
one 
community 
conversation 

and an Asian-American activism 
conference, where more than 
80 presenters addressed both 
campus and community issues.

Participants 
included 

prominent 
A/PIA 
scholars, 

artists, 
organizers 
and 
off-

campus leaders, including a U.S. 
congressman and a state senator. 
Two presenters have since been 
elected to the Michigan House of 
Representatives and Philadelphia 
City Council, respectively. These 
gatherings also addressed the lack 
of space for A/PIA and student of 
color organizations on campus, 
as well as the problem of a hostile 
campus climate.

To pretend that events of 

this magnitude never happened 
demonstrates 
either 
profound 

audacity or a supreme level of 
ignorance that should disqualify 
oneself 
from 
leadership 
in 

education. But why is LSA trying 
so hard to erase this history? We 
have some ideas.

First, when students don’t 

know how vibrant A/PIA Studies 
used to be, it is easier for LSA to 
pretend as if its new diversity plan 
is breaking new ground rather 
than peddling old rhetoric. Prior 
to the demise of the program, 

A/PIA Studies curriculum and 
faculty had a strong presence 
among 
student 
organizations 

and campus life, and frequently 
collaborated to put on events 
several times a semester. One of 
the annual events that has since 
dropped off was “HolidAPA”, 
an event held at the end of the 
fall semester to showcase A/
PIA Studies end-of-the-semester 
projects.

Second, 
setting 
low 

expectations makes it easier for 
LSA to defend its poor decision-
making 
regarding 
leadership 

choices for the A/PIA Studies 
program and Department of 
American Culture, which lost 20 
faculty of color from 1997 to 2016, 
including all four prior A/PIA 
Studies directors.

Third, Dean Martin and LSA 

are covering up their own roles in 
undermining faculty of color and 
ethnic studies. The University 
is currently the defendant in 
a landmark suit by two highly 
successful, 
award-winning 

faculty, who cite the University’s 
own documents to reveal how 
prior LSA deans and senior 
faculty opposed ethnic studies 
and favored white professors with 
thin resumes to lead American 
Culture.

If he wants to believe he is 

so committed to diversity and 
the A/PIA community, Dean 
Martin 
should 
retract 
these 

alternative facts and implement 
the five demands we presented 
in November 2016, and reinstate 
professors Kurashige and Lawsin 
immediately, giving them the 
resources needed to restore A/
PIA Studies at the University. If 
he will not do this, we challenge 
Martin 
— 
a 
quantitative 

researcher — to show us the data 
that on A/PIA Studies activity 
(e.g., student enrollment and 
involvement, fundraising, public 
events, 
local/national 
awards, 

media coverage) before and after 
Prof. Kurashige’s termination and 
explain the discrepancy.

F

or 
Christmas 
my 

sophomore year of college, 
my mom gave me “Just 

Mercy” by Bryan Stevenson. 
Since 
I 
had 
been 

aspiring to become a 
lawyer, she thought I 
might be inspired by 
the story of a lawyer 
who 
advocated 

for 
marginalized 

criminal defendants. 
She couldn’t have been 
more 
correct: 
Few 

books have the ability 
to 
transform 
my 

worldview as much 
as “Just Mercy” did. The work 
was compelling not just for its 
heart-wrenching stories about 
clients Stevenson represented, 
but also for the captivating and 
impassioned way that he made 
his case for justice, equality 
and mercy.

This 
combination 
was 

so 
compelling 
because, 
in 

my 
experience, 
these 
three 

ideals seem to be increasingly 
disentangled. 
The 
quest 
for 

justice and equality that I usually 
see, at this university and around 
the world, is a quest that reserves 
its compassion and mercy for 
only some. Often it alienates, 
ostracizes 
and 
condemns 

instead. This is found in “public-
shaming” culture, which reviles 
and castigates without asking 
questions or looking for context. 
We often decide based on a 
tweet or off-hand comment that 
someone is incurably prejudiced, 
evil and irredeemable. From our 
high horse we look down and 
judge. Stevenson, in contrast, 
argues 
for 
understanding 

and forgiveness, ideals that I 
have found to be difficult to 
implement in practice, but strive 
for nonetheless.

I 
embraced 
these 
ideas 

surrounding justice, particularly 
racial 
justice, 
upon 
reading 

“Just Mercy,” but over the 
years as I have had to deal 
with 
academic, 
professional 

and familial challenges, they 
have slowly faded to the back 
of my mind. They came to the 
forefront, however, when I found 
myself confronted with the sort 
of marginalized people whom 
Stevenson championed over the 
course of my legal internships 
and 
volunteering 
positions. 

These ideas also came back to 
me during heated debates on 
racial inequality with family 
and friends, particularly in light 
of the 2016 elections. Upon the 
rise of racial hatred, so many 
who advocated for racial justice 
and equality responded with 
equal amounts of hatred and 
anger. This might have been an 
acceptable response to a neo-
Nazi, but not so much to a Trump 
voter for whom the economy was 
a primary concern.

I 
was 
frustrated 
and 

disheartened that so many in 
our country either embraced a 
candidate who stirred up racial 
hatred and had close ties to 
white nationalists, or had simply 
chosen to look the other way. 

I was also worried about the 
response from the other side that 
chose to stigmatize and shame 
people instead of working to 

better 
understand 

them. 
Stevenson’s 

message came back to 
me, and I wondered 
what could have been 
done if bigotry had 
been met by mercy 
instead of venom.

Recently, 
it 

couldn’t have been 
more 
fitting 
that 

Stevenson spoke on 
campus, 
delivering 

the 25th annual Wallenberg 
Lecture. He was awarded the 
Wallenberg Medal for upholding 
the values of Raoul Wallenberg, 
a University alum who risked 
his life by (and was likely killed 
for) saving the lives of thousands 
of 
Hungarian 
Jews 
during 

the Holocaust. Stevenson and 
Raoul both embody the words 
inscribed on the medal, “One 
person can make a difference.”

During his lecture, Stevenson 

spoke at great length of his 
experiences representing clients 
who 
may 
have 
committed 

reprehensible crimes, but were 
still greatly mistreated by the 
criminal justice system. These 
stories 
still 
tugged 
on 
my 

heartstrings even years after 
having first read them in “Just 
Mercy.” Stevenson emphasized 
how the criminal justice system 
treats Blacks, Latinos, children, 
people of low income and people 
with mental disabilities unfairly.

Speaking of his experiences 

representing 
these 
guilty 

yet 
mistreated 
defendants, 

Stevenson 
said 
people 
“are 

more than the worst thing they 
have ever done.” When he says 
this he means that we should 
understand people are flawed 
and we should treat them with 
kindness and mercy. We should 
be willing to show forgiveness 
to people and not let them 
be defined by their mistakes, 
however severe. Stevenson also 
made clear that this empathy 
should not just be reserved for 
the marginalized. We use mercy 
when we deal with convicted 
felons as well as bigots.

During the lecture, Stevenson 

also advocated for the “power 
of proximity” as a way to gain 
understanding of the struggles 
of others, and thus be better able 
to help individuals instead of 
problem-solving from a distance. 
He also believes that this power 
of proximity can help to address 
bigotry. In fact, he believes we 
need to free people of their 
bigotry, and this can only happen 
when we have uncomfortable 
conversations. He believes these 
uncomfortable 
conversations 

about racism and inequality can 
help us address our country’s 
legacy of racism, and when we 
acknowledge and accept these 
truths we will be set free.

A powerful example of how 

effective these uncomfortable 
conversations can actually be is 
the case of Derek Black, the son 

of prominent white supremacists 
and the godson of David Duke, 
a former Ku Klux Klan grand 
wizard. Black embraced the 
white-nationalist ideology he 
was born into and surrounded 
by, and was widely considered 
to be the heir to the movement. 
This all began to change after 
he started studying at New 
College of Florida, a liberal and 
somewhat 
diverse 
university. 

After a few semesters of trying 
to hide his familial background, 
news spread around campus that 
a white supremacist was present. 
Although many students chose 
to shun him, some of Black’s 
acquaintances reached out to 
him and chose to include him. 
Black credits the conversations 
he had with these students as 
being one of the factors that 
helped him realize the damage 
that he had done. As a result, 
he has renounced the white 
nationalist movement.

Stevenson 
suggested 
during 

his lecture that children who 
are indoctrinated with white 
supremacy by their parents are 
subject to a certain form of child 
abuse. Certainly, people must 
take responsibility for their 
decisions and actions, but we 
must recognize that some people 
are taught racial superiority and 
hatred from a young age, which 
hinders their ability to recognize 
the liberating truth of equality. 
Luckily for Black, he went to 
school with peers who used mercy 
and compassion to set him free.

Stevenson encouraged us not 

to consider bigots and racists 
lost causes, and his manner of 
discussing issues of inequality 
and injustice seemed to show 
he had experience attempting 
to convert these people. His 
lecture 
was 
beautiful 
and 

persuasive, 
articulating 
his 

messages of equality, justice and 
mercy as convincingly as he did 
in his book. I appreciated that 
he conveyed these messages 
in a way that didn’t seek to 
punish those who didn’t already 
understand, but instead sought 
to create understanding. He 
avoided using overly academic 
terms to speak of issues of 
inequality and racism. He spoke 
with conviction and passion but 
avoided letting his emotions 
turn into anger or hatred. I hope 
the rest of us hoping to spread 
equality and fight injustice take a 
page out of his book, and learn to 
embrace mercy.

I’m 
not 
suggesting 
that 

anybody 
put 
themselves 
in 

danger or go out and befriend 
their local Klansman. Rather, 
I’m suggesting that we look 
for the humanity in everyone 
and try to have these difficult 
conversations 
when 
possible. 

Although meeting bigotry with 
mercy can be hard, it often helps 
me when I remember something 
I was taught in high school, 
“Hurt people hurt people and 
open hearts open hearts.”

I

n March, I moved to the 
United States and started 
my new position as a 

researcher at the University of 
Michigan. I accepted this offer 
when I still had the certain 
belief that Hillary Clinton 
would be elected president. 
Yet, I believed wrong — like 
so many others. Though I 
highly respect the vote of 
the Electoral College, on the 
morning of Nov. 9, I woke up 
overwhelmingly shocked and, 
in fact, scared by the election 
of Donald Trump as the next 
president of the United States. 
When I checked my phone, a 
friend of mine had texted me: 
“Now are you already looking 
forward to the purge?”

In her concession speech, 

Hillary 
Clinton 
said, 
“We 

owe (Donald Trump) an open 
mind and a chance to lead.” 
This might or might not be 
true, 
and 
in 
my 
opinion, 

when respecting democratic 
standards, there is no other 
option but to give him that 
chance. Particularly, as a non-
American I feel I am not in 
the position to say or demand 
otherwise. Also, I think I am 
not in the position to criticize 
or judge Trump’s ideas and 
actions concerning internal 
U.S. politics. But there are two 
things in particular that give 
me collywobbles when I think 
about the new president of the 
United States.

On Jan. 20, a person who 

literally said, “The concept of 
global warming was created 
by and for the Chinese in order 
to make U.S. manufacturing 
non-competitive” took office. 
During the presidential race, 
Trump 
promised 
anything 

but fighting climate change or 
progress toward clean energy 
in the United States. This has 
been underpinned by his first 
actions as president, and if 
he continues to implement 
what he promised, it will not 
only concern U.S. citizens — 
especially those who would 
become victims of fracking — 

but have a severe impact on the 
whole world.

This is a deeply frightening 

reality. I have heard people 
say things like “We just have 
to survive those four years 
and everything will be back 
to normal again.” But the 
sad truth is that a lot can be 
damaged in just four years. 
Already now, it will require 
a tremendous, collaborative 
effort to keep the planet from 
rising two degrees Celsius 
above 
the 
“pre-industrial” 

global temperature. But if 
the United States really quit 
the Paris climate agreement, 
that goal could be buried for 
good. This would be a disaster 
of global scale and the mere 
thought that it could actually 
happen is scaring me.

Second, in a foreign policy 

briefing — i.e., not in a speech 
before 
his 
supporters 
— 

Donald 
Trump 
reportedly 

asked, “If we have (nuclear 
weapons), why can’t we use 
them?” Now, if this does not 
worry you, I do not know 
what would. When looking 
at his well-documented lack 
of 
knowledge 
regarding 

foreign affairs and how thin-
skinned 
he 
can 
be 
when 

confronting criticism, I find 
it not exaggerated that before 
Election Day, Barack Obama 
said: “In the last two days, (his 
campaign team) had so little 
confidence in his self-control, 
they said, ‘We’re just going to 
take away your Twitter.’ Now, 
if somebody can’t handle a 
Twitter account, they can’t 

handle the nuclear codes.”

To 
be 
fair, 
the 
more 

experienced people that were 
chosen for Trump’s cabinet 
give me hope that they will 
have a moderating influence, 
especially in terms of foreign 
policy. 
But 
nonetheless, 

Donald 
Trump 
carrying 

around the launch codes for 
the United States’s nuclear 
weapons is a serious matter 
that concerns the whole world.

For some people in Europe, 

it now seems pretty convenient 
to 
blame 
the 
“stupid 

Americans.” But it is not that 
easy. And it is not about the 
United States, and not about 
Trump alone. On the one hand, 
as Michael Moore put it: “THE 
MAJORITY 
of 
our 
fellow 

Americans preferred Hillary 
Clinton over Donald Trump. 
Period. Fact.” This disproves the 
“stupid Americans” argument 
and is a sign of hope for everyone 
disapproving of Donald Trump’s 
views. On the other hand, the 
“movement” that helped Trump 
become president is happening 
in Europe as well. (Anyone 
heard of the Alternative für 
Deutschland party in Germany?) 
Hence, it is not an exclusively 
American phenomenon.

What I ultimately learned 

from the rise of Donald Trump 
is that voting alone is not 
enough anymore. Voting does 
not require you to create your 
own ideas, you just decide for 
or against the ideas of others. 
It is now more important than 
ever to actively participate 
in the political process and 
commit oneself to leaving a 
better world and a healthy 
planet behind. Therefore, just 
like Trump has an agenda for 
his first 100 days in office, I 
have an agenda for my first 
100 days in Michigan. And one 
of my first to-dos is to contact 
the Democratic Party in Ann 
Arbor and ask what I can do to 
help them.

O

ne of the first things 
you 
learn 
in 
film 

school is editor Walter 

Murch’s theory on the “ideal 
cut.” When deciding exactly 
where to make a cut, he says 
emotion, or the feeling in the 
scene, accounts for 51 percent 
of the decision. All of the other 
categories combined — story, 
rhythm, 
continuity, 
etc. 
— 

account for less than half of the 
decision-making process.

Last year, I decided to 

make a cut that very much 
went against the continuity, 
rhythm and story of my life up 
to that point. I was in the Ross 
School of Business, working 
an amazing job as student 
manager 
for 
the 
Michigan 

football team and was in the 
Sport Business Association and 
Big Ten Network Student U. I 
was well on my way to a career 
in sport business.

Yet, after much deliberation, 

I decided to leave the business 
school and go study film in LSA. 
The reasons were simple: I hate 
talking about money, and I love 
talking about movies. Now, 
after almost a full year in my 
new major, I’m making another 
cut. Again, I’m disregarding 
the continuity and the story in 
favor of what I’m feeling. I’m 
running for president of CSG 
because of that overwhelming 
51 percent. Because it kills 
me to know that at my school, 
the University of Michigan, 
there are students who have 
to face racial prejudice on a 
daily basis. At the University, 
students have to wait multiple 
weeks to get an appointment to 
talk about their mental health. 
At the University, a student 
can go through an entire 
semester 
without 
learning 

the name of one single person 
in their class. I created the 
Movement because I want to 
go to a university that lives up 
to its name, and because I see 
a potential for this school that 
I don’t think anyone else does.

What we stand for is quite 

literally 
“movement.” 
Our 

platform is divided into four 
main 
“pillars” 
highlighting 

aspects of the University we 

think need to move forward. 
Our first pillar is student-
body unity. We recognize that 
these are uncertain times in 
our country, and as students, 
we must be a united front 
to respond when we feel the 
need to do so. This means 
creating more public forums 
where students can share and 
discuss ideas, disseminating 
more 
information 
to 
keep 

our students up to date on 
important 
national 
events 

and conducting school-wide 
surveys 
to 
gauge 
student 

sentiment on these matters.

Next is education reform. 

There is evidence out there to 
suggest many college grads 
in the United States are not 
ready 
for 
the 
workforce. 

According to a 2015 study 
featured in Money, employers 
gave recent college graduates 
low grades in all 17 career-
readiness outcomes surveyed. 
Although this is a national 
issue, it’s our duty to address 
it here, on our campus. One 
thing that we can do is re-focus 
on the social aspect of the 
classroom and give students a 
voice in their own education. 
Our 
“Annual 
Education 

Forum” is one initiative we 
have 
where 
students 
will 

get up in front of faculty and 
voice their suggestions in an 
auditorium setting. By making 
the professors listen to us 
for a change, it will serve as 
a symbol of the University 
putting the students first and 
will give them the voice they so 
badly need.

Another huge issue on this 

campus is diversity. Over the 
last decade, though enrollment 
of 
some 
minority 
groups 

on 
campus 
has 
increased, 

enrollment of Black and Native 
Americans 
has 
decreased 

significantly, and more and 
more students are upset with 
an apathetic campus culture. 
We aim to change that through 
multiple ideas like our “Send 
the 
Elevator” 
initiative, 

where students from lower 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds 

mentor 
younger 
kids 
from 

similarly 
disadvantaged 

backgrounds to help navigate 
the path to higher education. 
Hopefully, 
this 
mentorship 

could 
help 
highlight 

opportunities that students in 
poorer communities might not 
see as available to them, and 
attract students from more 
diverse backgrounds to the 
University. Moreover, we wish 
to create paid positions within 
the University for people who 
engage in diversity labor. These 
people will help our school 
become a more welcoming 
and understanding place, and 
without compensation, they 
don’t have the time to commit 
to do this.

Our fourth and final pillar 

is mental health. We feel that 
in addition to continuing to 
expand CAPS, we must work 
together to combat the source 
of mental health issues on 
campus. One initiative we have 
in place to do just that is our 
Four-Years Campaign — a 
University-sponsored mission 
to help students thrive in the 
four years that they have here 
on campus. For many students, 
it’s the first time on their own 
and managing everything can 
become 
overwhelming. 
For 

others struggling, the stresses 
of college life may manifest 
certain problems which were 
previously 
manageable. 

This program will serve as a 
guide, through mentorship, 
workshops and conferences, 
to help students find the 
work-life balance that is right 
for them.

These are just some of our 

ideas under these four pillars 
that we are ready to fight for. 
We plan on listening to you, the 
students, and incorporating 
any major concerns you may 
have. For the next week we 
plan on having “office hours” 
at 
Movement 
Headquarters 

on 1304 Geddes Ave. for all 
following weekdays before 
the election on March 22. All 
students feel free to stop by 
anytime between 8 p.m. and 
10 p.m. to talk to us about 
your ideas.

‘Bitter Harvest’ overlooks 
genocide in new romance

Techno 
music, 
celebrity 

culture and a sheep: David 
Adjmi’s 
wildly 
extravagant 

and 
superbly 
funny 
play, 

“Marie Antoinette,” combines 
these 
elements 
and 
others 

to create an eccentric telling 
of the French Queen’s reign. 
This Friday and Saturday, the 
Residential College Players are 
performing the anomalous tale 
in East Quad’s Keene Theater.

Modernizing 
interactions 

and conversations of the 1700s, 
the play brings new insights to 
Antoinette’s lavish life.

“It is historical, but all of the 

dialogue is in contemporary 
vernacular. The author kind 
of picked some really unusual 
moments in her life to hone 
in on,” said RC Senior and 
director of the production, Sara 
Head. “I think it’s a much more 
psychological look at what 
happened to her and her life 
and her story.”

Original 
and 
grandiose, 

the 
tragicomedy 
leads 
up 

to 
Antoinette’s 
execution, 

following her throughout her 
reign as Queen of France.

“I think it’s super timely. 

One would expect it to not be 
super relevant considering it 
all happened 300 years ago, but 
it offers some really poignant 
commentary 
on 
celebrity 

culture 
and 
what 
happens 

when you put somebody up on 
a pedestal and give them all 
of this authority over culture 
without really holding them to 
any set standards,” Head said.

Pertinent to the current 

political climate, the show 
plays with the concept of power 
and the extent to which it can 
be interpreted and stretched. 
It deals with the lavishness 
that so often consumes society, 
crafting the character of Marie 
Antoinette out of the grand 
values of her setting. The play 
delves into this and takes the 
audience through the rise and 
fall of her royal 
tragedy.

“Marie 

Antoinette” 
combines 
its 

themes 
with 

diverse 
lighting 

and 
soundscapes 

to 
create 
an 

otherworldly 
experience. 
Drawing 
inspiration 
from 

both 
traditional 

and contemporary 
music, 
Head 
crafted 
a 

soundtrack that ranges from 
classical all the way to techno.

The effect: a show that’s 

grand enough to entice the 
audience, 
strange 
enough 

to keep them interested and 
impactful 
enough 
to 
leave 

them mulling over what just 
happened.

The nature of the production 

is 
“surrealist,” 
Head 
said. 

“There’s a sheep character that 
comes in and talks to Marie, 
and all of these kinds of weird 
things that you can’t really tell 
what’s real and what’s not.”

With a context that calls for 

an over-the-top set and time 
period costumes, the opulence 
of Marie Antoinette’s life is 
something that has necessitated 
extreme time and efforts to 

emulate. The play has been a 
true labor of love for Head and 
the rest of the RC Players.

“The RC players can only 

provide a small budget, and I’ve 
been fundraising like crazy and 
applying for grants, and I think 
we’ve managed to get enough to 
put together a really cool set,” 
Head added. “We also have the 
whole of the RC Players kind 

of backing us up 
and 
providing 

support 
wherever 
we 

need it. It has 
been 
a 
huge 

group 
effort. 

Our 
faculty 

advisor 
has 

been coming in 
and helping us 
get access to set 
pieces and props 
that 
we 
need, 

so I’ve gotten 

everybody on board with this 
project.”

Tirelessly 
working 
to 

embody the artifice of Marie 
Antoinette’s world, the RC 
Players have put together a 
show that journeys through 
the concepts of power and 
extravagance, 
giving 
the 

audience 
a 
spectacularly 

original experience.

“Just come in looking to 

experience a new take on a 
classic story,” Head said. “We’re 
mostly hoping that people are 
a little bit different when they 
walk out than when they first 
walked in, whether that just 
means they were entertained 
or they took something a little 
deeper from it. We just want to 
make some kind of impact on 
the audience.”

Roadside Attactions

People will always cycle 

in and out of your life. The 
“revolving” door metaphor that 
we so heavily rely on in order 
to understand our changing 
relationships 
has 
remained 

relevant 
because 
of 
our 

widespread 
acknowledgment 

of 
its 
truth. 
Relationships 

change and people come and 
go, and as one who enjoys 
analyzing the habits of the 
communities 
I 
live 
in, 
it 

seems only fitting I share the 
observations I have gathered.

Our 
world 
has 
become 

immune 
to 
relationships 

changing all the time. We go 
through “seasons” of being 
close with some people before 
eventually falling out of that 
community. This has led to 
the failure to commit; that 
is to really, truly commit 
to 
maintaining 
a 
level 
of 

knowledge about a person and 
his or her life. We should reject 
this passive, “that’s how things 
go” 
mindset, 
and 
instead, 

express an adamant and sincere 
effort to keep relationships 
strong. It’s impossible to do 
with everyone, and of course, 
that is to be expected.

But when we run into that 

old friend and say, “Wow, it 
has been so long! We should 
grab lunch soon!” Do we ever 
actually do that? If it has 
become 
a 
consistent 
habit 

to never follow through, is 
it because we are relying on 
the belief that we have lost 
touch with enough people in 
our past? And will it matter 
whether or not we make the 
effort now? When we say that 
we wish to see that person, are 
we also reminding ourselves 
that it likely won’t happen?

A few weeks may go by and 

you think to yourself: “I would 
have liked to see that person.” 
Maybe you could have cleared 
that window of time, but it 
didn’t happen. Those months 
become years, and soon you 
wonder what ever happened to 
the person you had seen so long 
ago on the sidewalk.

Maybe 
it’s 
just 
that 
a 

majority of our relationships 
lack substance, so it seems the 
shallow level of our friendships 
or relationships is just one 

more unavoidable fate and we 
lose touch simply because of 
that. I’m admittedly a victim 
of this mindset, and it has 
resulted in a consistent form of 
neglect.

Just a few days ago, my 

professor reminded me of the 
importance 
of 
maintaining 

these ties. He said: “We declare 
our priorities most in our use of 
our time.”

How we choose to use our 

time is among one of the few 
things we can actually control, 
and it reveals the quality of 
our 
relationships 
and 
our 

willingness 
to 
continually 

invest in them.

He went on to explain that 

if you walk around saying to 
people, “I care so much about 
you or I love you, but I am too 
busy,” than you’ve made your 
priorities abundantly clear.

Writing this as someone 

who was once told by a former 
boyfriend he was just too 
“busy” to date me, it seems 
appropriate to also address 
what 
implications 
these 

habits carry. Let’s get out of 
this ridiculous mindset that 
relationships should exist when 
it is convenient. The excuse 
you use today will change to 
something 
else 
tomorrow. 

By using the easy escape of 
claiming you’re “too busy,” 
you’re inexplicitly stating what 
matters most to you.

My point is that generally, 

people are always in and out of 
our lives — and many of those 
people we lose unwillingly. 
Sickness 
strikes 
and 
takes 

away a loved one. Friends move 
away. 
Family 
ties 
weaken. 

Relationships, platonic or not, 
fall apart.

In light of knowing people 

are going to leave, why not 
make more of an effort now 
to sustain the bonds with 
others when it is possible to 
do so? It takes tremendous 
effort and sacrifice, which I’m 
not convinced we are always 
willing to contribute to others.

Whether it is college, or 

wherever you go beyond this 
place, make sure you are aware 
of how you are investing in 
your 
relationships. 
If 
you 

prioritize such efforts, whether 
convenient or not, you’ll reap 
the benefits of relationships 
that 
are 
long 
lasting 
and 

persist even through the ever-
changing 
circumstances 
of 

your life. 

SINGLE REVIEW

In 2013, at age sixteen, 

Lorde, a then-unknown girl 
from New Zealand, became 

an international pop star. 
Like many before her, she 

gained stardom and quickly 
lost privacy. Tabloids body-
shamed her, plastering pho-
tos of her and her boyfriend 
across the internet. “Royals” 

— her break-out single — 

debuted in June of 2013, and 

by October it was number 

one on the Billboard Hot 100. 
In five short months, Lorde’s 

life was entirely public.

“Liability,” Lorde’s second 
single from her sophomore 
album Melodrama, details 

how fame tore apart her rela-

tionship. The fame-ruined-
my-life narrative is nothing 

new. In fact, it’s almost 

expected: Britney Spears 

had “Lucky,” depicting the 

never-ending labors of a 

pop star, while Taylor Swift 

penned “The Lucky One,” 

lamenting on the loneliness 
of fame. But Lorde’s single 

stands out from her peers in 

its specificity. Everything 

about the song is pointed, 
leaving room for listeners 
to process the heartbreak. 
The piano notes are repeti-

tive and simple, a drastic 
change from Lorde’s typi-

cally diverse and electronic 

production. Even Lorde’s 

cadences are acute, ending 
her phrases with succinct 

pronunciations, signaling 
listeners to really hear her 

story.

Aside from the stripped 

down production, the 

single’s true merit comes 

from Lorde’s lyrics, as she 
recalls a conversation with 

a past lover. In retelling 

an exact moment in time, 

Lorde invites listeners into 
this conversation. They can 

picture Lorde “crying in 

the taxi” while the ex tells 

her that “he made the big 

mistake of dancing in (her) 
storm.” After the breakup, 

Lorde goes home and returns 
to “the arms of the girl (she) 
loves,” an allusion to finding 
solace in one’s self after los-
ing a lover. Throughout the 

song, Lorde’s voice is so clear 

and exposed, it’s almost 

as if she’s singing directly 
into your ear. Her voice is 

intimate and burdened with 
emotion, dragging the word 

“poison” like it was too 

heavy to let go. 

For two minutes and 52 sec-

onds, listeners act like an 

omniscient entity, witness-

ing Lorde’s breakup and sub-
sequent recovery. “Liability” 

showcases an entirely new, 
raw and profoundly intro-
spective side of Lorde, sug-

gesting that Melodrama may 

not be Pure Heroine … and 

that’s okay.

Life as the revolving door: 
Who is coming and going?

BAILEY 
KADIAN

As far as films about tragic 

historical events go, most of 
the lot manage to elicit any 
number of reactions from the 
audience. From “Saving Private 
Ryan” to “Schindler’s List” to 
“Inglourious Basterds,” tough 
subject matter can make us 
scream, cry or laugh. However, 
the only reaction viewers of 
“Bitter Harvest” will have is one 
of regret, regret for buying the 
ticket in the first place. “Bitter 
Harvest” is supposed to tell the 
story of romance within the 
frame of the genocidal impact of 
the Holodomor famine in 1933 
Soviet Ukraine. However, the 
romance is over-the-top and the 
tragic famine is disregarded for 
obviously staged fight scenes 
and desperately dramatic scores. 
The outcome of “Bitter Harvest” 
is a cliché war movie bathed 
in melodrama and ending in 
disappointment. 

“Bitter Harvest” follows Yuri 

(Max Irons, “Red Riding Hood”), 
a young artist who leaves his 
small Ukrainian village and his 
lover, Natalka (Samantha Barks, 
“Les Miserables”), to pursue 
art in the capital, Kiev. While 
Yuri is painting and attending 
boisterous Ukrainian nationalist 
rallies, Natalka and his family 
are being starved by Stalin and 
his army in one of the deadliest 
famines, later to become known 

as the Holodomor Famine. While 
Yuri gets into some trouble 
in an overly-bloodied, overly-
expected bar fight, Natalka finds 
herself starving and reluctantly 
pursuing a career as a “lovely 
lady” a la Barks’s previous role 
in “Les Miserables.” The lovers 
exchange 
terribly 
romantic 

letters in the sappiest language 
since 
“The 

Notebook.” 
The 

letters are of course 
narrated, because 
why not, with letter 
writing voiceovers 
reminiscent of a 
bad Jane Austen 
adaptation.

The 
small 

Ukrainian village that Yuri 
and Natalka call home is a 
fetishized version of a life-
size doll house for one of those 
Russian stacking dolls, filled 
with random festive dances and 
enough colorful embroidery to 
cover your grandmother’s doily 
collection. Like everything else 
in “Bitter Harvest,” the acting 
is 
melodramatic 
and 
over-

dramatic. Irons and Barks turn 
every interaction into the end of 
a Shakespearean tragedy with 
an overdose of crying and face-
touching. A lot of people die in 
this movie, but they all blend 
into one — bedridden, gasping 
for breath and reaching for the 
heavens almost-corpse adorned 
with makeup so gray and sad 
that it looks as if Tim Burton 
animated it.

Every 
choice 
in 
“Bitter 

Harvest” 
is 
either 
obvious, 

melodramatic or both. However, 
it is worth commending the 
film on its one success; the 
cinematography 
(Douglas 

Milsome, “Full Metal Jacket) 
is stunning. Filmed in the 
Ukrainian 
countryside, 
the 

beautiful opening shots give 

false hope to a 
rather mediocre 
film. While the 
bleak, 
gloomy 

footage 
from 

Kiev 
and 
the 

wintry 
tundra 

of 
Siberia 
add 

contrast 
to 

the 
painterly 

landscapes of Ukraine, it is 
again, an expectedly obvious 
choice.

“Bitter 
Harvest” 
is 
a 

substandard attempt at trying 
to depict an overlooked tragedy. 
The romance between Yuri 
and Natalka overshadows the 
tragedy of Holodomor. “Bitter 
Harvest” is so preoccupied with 
trying to capture the love story, 
that both the romance and the 
famine suffer. Sadly, the viewer 
will not learn anything of the 
Holodomor famine until the very 
end of the film, where before the 
credits roll the event is finally 
clarified with a few frames of 
text. The Holodomor famine 
is most certainly a story worth 
telling, but “Bitter Harvest” 
does not do near enough justice 
to the heartbreaking genocide.

Instagram stars dressed 
by and for the internet age

Promoting personal brand in a digital community that 
promotes copy-cat culture in order to join ‘The Culture’

In “Orlando” by Virginia 

Woolf, she writes: “There is 
much to support the view that 
it is clothes that wear us, and 
not we, them; we may make 
them take the mould of arm 
or breast, but they mould our 
hearts, our brains, our tongues 
to their liking.”

That’s a quote that has 

stuck with me for a long time. 
Where the likes of David 
Bowie and Keith Richards 
have 
defined 
what’s 
now 

known as the rock ‘n’ roll 
aesthetic, others wear the garb 
in an aspirational sense. When 
skaters wore Thrasher to show 
their support of subcultural 
publications, others donned 
the hoodies once they hit the 
mainstream. Nowadays, style 
is trending towards a sense of 
conformity. I think the biggest 
culprit for the proliferation of 
unoriginality is Instagram.

Instagram is a wonderful 

platform for the dissemination 

of fashion. Through Instagram 
I have connected with people 
from all over the world with an 
interest in fashion, and some 
of these people have become 
close friends. I sometimes 
find myself spending more 
time messaging people from 
these fashion groups than my 
best friends from high school 
— not because we’re better 
friends, but because we finally 
have a platform where we can 
nerd out about fashion. It’s 
something that I craved for the 
longest time: Finding people 
who were equally passionate 
about clothing.

When I found platforms like 

Instagram and Reddit that let 
me connect with both lifelong 
friends and strangers, I was 
hooked. At the same time, the 
thirst for Instagram success 
is not a foreign concept; there 
are countless articles outlining 
the twelve-step program for 
gaining followers. For some 
it’s a way of making money, but 
for most it’s simply driven by 
a desire to share content with 
similarly-interested 
people 

and to feast in the likes and 
followers.

When I really started to 

spend 
time 
on 
Instagram, 

exploring different fashion-
related hashtags and accounts, 
I had the realization that 
people love to dress the same 
way. That’s not necessarily 
to say that the exact outfit is 
replicated by dozens, if not 
hundreds, of people, but that 
a certain, paint-by-numbers 
approach is taken to fashion. 
The people you see under 
the 
tag 
#thefeargeneration 

dress up in Jerry Lorenzo 
cosplay, while a search of the 
#supremenewyork 
tag 
will 

yield enough box-logo hoodies 
to put a salty taste in your 
mouth for coming up empty on 
the last drop. The thing is that 
there are people who will post 
outfits that deviate from the 
cookie-cutter 
aesthetic, 
but 

the problem with Instagram is 
the fact that these photos don’t 
get as many likes, comments 
or lead to as many followers 
as simpler outfits. It’s difficult 
for anyone who is motivated 

by internet fame to push 
boundaries because it won’t 
lead to the same success as 
sticking with what works.

I think this overlooks a key 

point, which is the fact that 
many people know that they 
want to dress well or dress in 
a certain way but don’t know 
how to achieve that aesthetic. 
It’s very easy to look to a 
person whose fashion sense 
has been applauded by the 
masses 
on 
Instagram 
and 

work to emulate it at the start. 
Once someone is comfortable 
with their new look, they will 
begin to post their own fits to 
the Internet. From there, it’s 
undeniable that many people 
like the self-gratification of 
knowing that well-established 
fashion accounts are dressing 
like them, so they are more 
likely to follow accounts and 
like photos that reaffirm their 

fashion choices.

From here the cycle begins 

again: Someone looking to 
begin to define their style 
will look up to more well-
established users for tips and 
tricks. Because these users 
know that the more avant-
garde outfits aren’t going to 
give them sufficient exposure, 
they will continue to post 
basic outfits to Instagram, 
which will once again inspire 
someone who is just getting 
into 
fashion, 
which 
will 

increase the body of people 
who are focused on a certain 
look. All of this boils down 
to the fact that so long as 
people are driven by likes and 
followers, which isn’t likely to 
stop anytime soon, the current 
state of Instagram fashion 
is going to stagnate for the 
foreseeable future.

French women and the 
myth of ‘effortlessness’

Vogue // Instagram

This 
past 
week 
as 
Paris 

shuttered Fashion Month I was 
greeted with a barrage of French 
girl-related headlines from nearly 
every sartorial news outlet. Said 
headlines ranged from inane 
(“French Girls Do Everything 
Better, Even Instagram (And 
It’s Because They Don’t Care)”) 
to absolutely eye-roll inducing 
(“Confirmed: French Girls Love 
the Underwear You Hate”). Vogue 
even went as far as to publish an 
article titled “Are French Girls the 
Only Ones We Should Look to for 
Style Advice?” on their Snapchat, 
which quoted this sage insight 
from fashion writer Elizabeth 
Hawes: “There is no word in 
English for chic. Why should there 
be? Everything chic is by legend 
French. Perhaps everything chic 
is in reality French.” 

This is, of course, blatantly 

false. The French do not hold 
claim on chicness, and they most 
definitely are not the only ones 
with a word for it. Just because 
the word “chic” is French in 
origin does not mean it is not also 
very much part of the English 
lexicon. Analogously, the word 
“restaurant” is likewise French, 
but no one would ever assert 
that we do not have a word for it 
in English. Factual inaccuracies 
aside, I find this deification of 
the French woman and her style 
irksome.

 French style stereotypically 

diverges 
from 
American’s 

primarily in the application of 
effort. The French girl mindlessly 
tousles her hair, her skin both 
unblemished by makeup and 
stunningly clear. Her outfit is 
marked by its simplicity, perhaps 
just a sweater, trousers and heels 
— everything tailored impeccably. 
Conversely, the American girl 
twirls a loose strand of her 
blowout, her words framed by 
an undaunted shade of lipstick. 
Her body is wrapped in layered 
garments. These tropes both look 
perfect — but only the American 
seems to have tried.

I have nothing against French 

style. I find their minimalism 
elegant, 
and, 
despite 
advice 

from friends, I have been on the 
hunt for a good beret for some 
time. Not to mention, there is 
something undeniably alluring 
about the idea that you can look 
great while “undone.” What I 
find bothersome is the vilification 
of effort. The recurring motif in 
all these articles is that French 
women are superior to American 
counterparts because they do not 
try. 

Perhaps my annoyance is a 

pervasion of my own personal 
insecurities. 
I 
was 
first 

introduced to the term “try-hard” 
when I was 13-years-old by an 
identically-aged boy. He used the 
term frequently, each time with 
disgust. I was not entirely sure 
what a try-hard was, but I knew 
it was the absolute worst thing 

to be. Thankfully, I was spared 
the awareness that the loser who 
he was describing was, in fact, 
me. I have been the Hermione in 
Snape’s inaugural potions class 
(me: Hand eagerly erect, teacher: 
Anyone? Anyone?) multiple times. 
Granted, 
the 
aforementioned 

scene is the apex of my try-hard-
ness — usually I am much more 
mellow. Still, my accolades are 
almost invariably coupled with 
effort.

So, yes, I am bugged by lazy 

journalism 
that 
propagates 

the superiority of French style. 
French women are gloriously chic, 
and there’s nothing wrong with 
modeling your style after them, 
but they are not the sun upon 
which the sartorial solar system 
rotates. If you love fashion the 
fun is often in the effort. I enjoy 
the sometimes 30 minutes it takes 
me to get dressed, “outfit testing” 
as I dance about to pop music. 
And after I’ve finally settled on 
an outfit, I want to look perfect; I 
want you to take note of my outfit 
and know that I tried. 

The idea that your outfit would 

be improved with less effort is 
offensive — your trouble merits 
appreciation. It shows you care 
and it’s indicative of prowess. 
What’s more: Don’t believe for a 
second those French women don’t 
apply themselves. Of course they 
do, they just double their effort 
simply to make it seem as if they 
didn’t. Don’t fall for the farce. 
You’re pretty cool, too; don’t let 
anyone tell you any different.

Wolverines rolling into Big Ten Tournament

The Michigan hockey team’s 

change in mentality was wholly 
apparent from the moment it 
began around a month ago.

The Wolverines started to 

come to terms with an unpleasant 
reality: 
with 
a 
record 
well 

below .500, Michigan would 
not be securing a bid to the 
NCAA Tournament during the 
regular season. From there, the 
Wolverines started to think of 
themselves as the underdog. 

If they were to qualify for the 

NCAA Tournament at all, they 
would need to run the gauntlet at 
the Big Ten Tournament, winning 
three games in as many days — a 
scenario that players such as 
senior forward and captain Alex 
Kile were quick to point out as the 
team’s ultimate goal.

And so, the second half of the 

season became a trial run of sorts. 
How much desperation could this 
team play with, and how much 

progress could it show before the 
conference tournament? After all, 
the same version of the team that 
at one point held a 9-17-3 record 
wouldn’t be likely to make it past 
the first day.

But give Michigan credit: it 

took its blows, and while some 
may say the change in identity 
took too long to happen, it has 
the 
Wolverines 
experiencing 

the most success they’ve had all 
season. They have dropped only 
one of their past five games, with 
all four wins coming against 
ranked teams that have either 
locked up or are competing for 
NCAA Tournament bids: No. 13 
Ohio State, No. 5 Minnesota and 
No. 15 Penn State.

And now, that long-awaited 

moment is here. Michigan is 
headed to Joe Louis Arena, where 
it will fight to keep its season — 
and in the case of the seniors, their 
careers — alive, starting with an 
opening-round game Thursday 
night against the Nittany Lions.

“I think we had beginner’s 

luck at the beginning of the year 
with a couple of wins when we 
didn’t really know ourselves yet,” 
said senior defenseman Nolan 
De Jong. “Then we obviously 
struggled through the heart of the 
season. Now we’ve come into our 
own a little bit. We understand 
how we have to play. …”

“We found our identity a little 

more, and we know we can grind 
out these games and hold a lead 
better now than in the middle of 
the season.”

The Wolverines are coming 

off the heels of a sweep against 
Penn State this past weekend that 
included a 4-0 shutout Saturday. 
Though the score was lopsided, 
Michigan was well aware that it 
didn’t play as well as it could have. 
Berenson pointed it out after the 
game, as did senior goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort, who stood on 
his head and turned in a 46-save 
performance as the Nittany Lions 
outshot the Wolverines by a 2:1 
ratio.

It was evidence that although 

Michigan’s 
record 
may 
be 

red-hot 
amidst 
its 
attitude 

adjustment, the team still has a 
lot of room for improvement. The 
Wolverines, with their abysmal 
Corsi numbers, don’t have the 
firepower to play the way they 
have in the past. Any postseason 
run will involve a combination 
of pucks bouncing the right way, 
the team’s trio of goaltenders 
continuing their stellar play and a 
tangible improvement on defense, 
which Michigan spent all week in 
practice working for.

“It all comes down to the F3 

and F2,” said senior forward Alex 
Kile. “If you’re in on the forecheck 
and (Penn State) breaks the puck 
out, you’ve got to backcheck 
because their defensemen are 
really active and provide a lot 
of offense for them. That’s been 
our main focus. All their good 
chances this weekend were off 
rushes — 3-on-2s, 4-on-2s — with 
no backcheck, as we’ve found.”

Yet the Wolverines, thanks to 

Nagelvoort, withstood Saturday’s 
onslaught, and winning the game 
in that fashion only added to the 
growing belief within the team 
that they can write their own 
Cinderella story this weekend.

“I think this is definitely the 

most confident we’ve been all 
year,” De Jong said. “We know 
it’s going to be a challenge to beat 
the same team three times in a 
row because we know that we 
got outplayed at certain times on 
the weekend. But we definitely 
have that confidence and we 
know that we can win games 
whether they’re tight games or 
having to hold a lead. It’s the Big 
Ten Tournament and anything 
can happen — that’s the kind of 
attitude we’re going in with.”

Added 
Kile: 
“Once 
you’re 

realistic with yourself and realize 
other teams have better records 
and you are the underdog in most 
of the games you play, I think it 
benefits you. … The past three 
weeks have been the closest we’ve 
ever been as a team this year. We 
just have a belief in the locker 
room right now.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ to open WNIT run

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team 
is 
facing 
a 

postseason test — not of skill but of 
character. The Wolverines (11-5 Big 
Ten, 22-9 overall) were snubbed by 
the NCAA Tournament selection 
committee after finishing third in 
the Big Ten, but their postseason is 
not over.

Michigan will play its first 

game of the Women’s National 
Invitational Tournament against 
Kent State on Thursday night. 
While this is not the tournament 
it strove to end up in, it will give 
the Wolverines the chance to 
conclude their season on a high 
note — and potentially prove the 
NCAA wrong. 
 

“Obviously, we’re extremely 

disappointed,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico. “But 
it’s going to be about how we 
move on from here and let that 
disappointment fuel us.”

This will be Michigan’s eighth-

straight postseason appearance, 
with its last two seasons ending 
in the WNIT semifinals. The 
Wolverines have never made it 
past the semifinal round but they 
certainly have the potential to 
break that record this year.

The Golden Flashes (13-5 Mid-

Atlantic, 19-12 overall) have a 
similar record to Michigan, but 
the Wolverines’ schedule was 
undeniably 
more 
challenging. 

Michigan faced five top-25 ranked 
teams, while Kent State only 
played then-No. 5 Baylor, to whom 
they lost 84-42 back in November.

The two teams have also 

faced off against four common 
opponents this season: Western 
Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota and 
Iowa. The Wolverines beat all 
four, while the Golden Flashes 
were victorious over just the 
Broncos and the Bobcats. Kent 
State suffered blowout losses 
to the Golden Gophers and the 
Hawkeyes, falling 92-62 and 
83-48, respectively.

Yet, Michigan’s defense, led by 

junior guard Jillian Dunston and 
senior guard Siera Thompson, will 
have to watch out for offensive 
juggernaut guard Larissa Lurken, 
who averages 23.6 points, 6.6 
rebounds and 2.8 assists per 
game. Forward Jordan Korinek is 
the only other Golden Flash who 
averages over 10 points a game. If 
the Wolverines are able to shut the 
duo down, Kent State will have a 
hard time sinking shots.

Michigan’s 
main 
concern 

will be regaining its scoring 
confidence. 
The 
Wolverines 

have not played since losing to 
Michigan State 74-64 in the 
Big Ten Tournament on Mar. 3. 
In that game, freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick, junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty and sophomore 
center Hallie Thome scored 23, 18 
and 16 points, respectively. Despite 
their considerable efforts against 
the Spartans, Michigan’s top three 
scorers (and the highest scoring 
trio in the Big Ten) were unable to 
solidify the win.

The 
Wolverines 
also 
lost 

their last regular season game 
to Penn State on Feb. 26, though 
Gondrezick tallied 25 points, 
Flaherty scored 22 and Thome 
had 14. Against better teams, the 
trio’s talent has not been quite 
enough to push Michigan over 
the brink. While it may not be a 
deciding factor against the Golden 
Flashes — who have not proven 
to have a deep offensive unit this 
season — the Wolverines could use 
scoring help from Thompson and 
sophomore guard Nicole Munger.

Even though Michigan has lost 

four of its last five games, it has had 
almost two weeks off to rest and 
practice. With a proper mindset, 
the Wolverines can shake off 
lingering disappointment and still 
make program history by winning 
the WNIT.

“Our senior class has done a little 

better than the year before it and 
put our team in a better position 
than the year before it every year 
since I’ve been here,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We’re definitely headed in 
the right direction.”

Brdar, Thomas spark Michigan 
as a potent infield combination

Through 15 games this season, 

the 
Michigan 
baseball 
team 

has kept pace with last year’s 
offensive 
output. 
The 
2016 

Wolverines scored at a rate of 
6.35 runs per game, while this 
year’s edition currently crosses 
the plate an average of 6.33 times 
per game. 

With seven regular starters 

returning from last year, this type 
of production at the plate was 
expected. But two other players 
have also stepped up as offensive 
contributors – senior shortstop 
Michael Brdar and sophomore 
second baseman Ako Thomas.

Last season, Brdar and Thomas 

were new to the team – Brdar 
as a junior college transfer from 
Diablo Valley College in California 
and Thomas as a freshman 
from 
Chicago. 
Despite 
their 

lack of experience in Division I 
baseball, the pair quickly became 
mainstays in Michigan’s lineup, 
both appearing in 53 games. 
However, Thomas and Brdar 
were relative nonfactors at the 
plate, ranking just seventh and 
10th on the team, respectively, in 
batting average, and they drove in 
just 32 runs between them.

This year, the pair lead the 

Wolverines in batting average, 
with Thomas hitting .339 and 
Brdar putting up a .328 clip. 
Thomas is also tied for second in 
runs batted in with 10, and Brdar 
has already eclipsed his home run 
total from last season with two, 
while driving in eight runs of his 
own.

There isn’t anyone in the 

Michigan 
program 
who 
has 

forgotten last season’s dismal 
finish, in which the Wolverines 
let a NCAA Tournament bid slip 
out of their hands by losing seven 
of their final nine games after a 
34-12 start. The memory of that 
slide has manifested itself as a 
more aggressive mentality for the 
Wolverines this season.

“There’s no taking the foot off 

the gas pedal,” Brdar said. “We 
saw last year the difference was a 

couple games – every pitch, every 
moment we have is important. 
You always talk about that, but 
we never really saw it until last 
year.

“We’re more aggressive in 

everything we do, with running 
the bases, playing defense, coach 
calling signs and in the weight 
room. I think we have more intent 
with everything we do.”

This new mentality has shown 

itself most prominently on the 
basepaths. Michigan was a solid 
base-stealing team last season, 
with 60 steals in 83 attempts, but 
this season the Wolverines have 
gone from decent to dangerous, 
swiping 35 bases in 39 attempts to 
rank sixth nationally.

Leading this improvement has 

been Brdar and Thomas, who 
combined to steal just four bases 
while being caught six times in 

2016. However, raw speed was 
never the issue for the pair – it 
was instead getting acclimated 
to the pressures of Division I 
college baseball. With a full year 
of experience under their belts, 
Thomas and Brdar now rank 15th 
and 26th in the nation in steals, 
respectively – Thomas with nine 
and Brdar with eight.

“We’re just as fast as we were 

last season, but it was our first 
year, and we didn’t have all the 
confidence we do now,” Brdar 
said. “Now when we’re on the 
bases, we have more confidence, 
we trust our jumps and trust what 
we see to be able to actually steal 
bases instead of being hesitant.”

Added Thomas: “We’ve just 

been more aggressive this year, 
trying to get guys in scoring 
positions as much as we can.”

But a team must be able to 

reach base in order to steal bases 
in the first place, and Michigan 
has excelled in putting runners 
aboard in a variety of ways. The 
Wolverines are drawing one more 
walk per game than they did last 
season. Thomas (.438 OBP) and 
Brdar (.418 OBP) have paced 
the Wolverines with their plate 
discipline, and they have excelled 
at making contact as well, having 
combined to strike out in just 13 
percent of their at-bats.

“We can manufacture some 

runs for sure,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “I like when 
our offense is very disciplined 
and doesn’t chase out of the zone, 
and we’ve got a lot of speed in the 
lineup that can really get around 
those bases fast.”

Brdar and Thomas have also 

formed 
a 
defensive 
bedrock 

in the middle of the infield. 
Michigan has committed just 
half as many errors per game as 
it did last season, and Brdar and 
Thomas have been central to this 
defensive resurgence. Working in 
combination with each other, the 
pair has helped the Wolverines 
turn 11 double plays already, 
while the Wolverines recorded 
just 26 for the whole of last 
season. Thomas in particular 
has displayed a penchant for 
highlight-reel moments at second 
base, while sporting a perfect 
fielding percentage.

“What doesn’t show up in 

the boxscore is the web-gem 
play after web-gem play that 
he makes,” Bakich said. “The 
difficult play that you think is a 
hit that somehow he’s got a glove 
on it and then throws a guy out, 
and the double plays that he’s in 
the middle of with he and Michael 
Brdar. He is a true sparkplug type 
guy.”

Michigan shot out to a fast 

start last season, and this year’s 
version has done so as well. But 
a more aggressive mindset in

Cost of admission hurts Michigan students during NCAA Tournament

There were just five of them, 

but by the noise they were making, 
you would have thought there were 
more. 

Way up in the upper deck of the 

Verizon Center, five members of the 
Michigan Maize Rage stood, yelled 
and cheered the Wolverines for four 
straight days all the way to a Big Ten 
Tournament championship.

For two of those fans — 

kinesiology sophomore Jonathan 
Markwort 
and 
engineering 

sophomore Alex Kettwich — it was 
a once in a lifetime experience.

“I don’t know if I’m ever going 

to see anything as amazing again,” 
Kettwich said. “I thought the 
Maryland game last year when (the 
Terrapins) were ranked No. 2 was 
amazing, but that wasn’t even close. 
This was absolutely fantastic.”

But for many other passionate 

members of the Maize Rage, it was 
a weekend that could never happen. 
When the Big Ten announced back 
in May 2014 that the conference 
was taking its annual basketball 
tournament to the East Coast, 
students were just about the last 
group considered in the decision-
making process when they chose 
the location.

Ann Arbor is 530 miles — over an 

eight-hour drive — from the heart of 
Washington. But compared to the 
distance between most other Big 
Ten schools and the Verizon Center, 
that’s an easy ride. Maryland, 
Rutgers, Penn State and Ohio State 
are the only schools closer.

Kettwich, 
though, 
said 

after experiencing the Big Ten 
Tournament for the first time last 
year, there was no distance too far 
for him to travel to be a part of it 
again.

“I went to Indianapolis last year 

as a freshman, and I loved going 
there,” Kettwich said. “I’ve always 
liked basketball, and a year-and-
a-half ago, I went to D.C. I wanted 
to join the two together. Compared 
to Indianapolis, it was a lot more 
difficult, but I wouldn’t complain. 
Washington is an awesome city.”

While having to go all the 

way to Washington to get his 
fix of basketball wasn’t ideal for 
Kettwich, the Big Ten at least made 
it worthwhile for him and others 
making the trip.

The conference offered $35 

ticket packages for students making 
the trek to the Verizon Center. 
That package got students an 
upper-deck seat for every session 
in which their school was playing. 
That meant Kettwich, Markwort 
and their friends ended up paying 
$5 each per game to watch all four 
games Michigan played in plus an 
additional three games played in the 
same sessions.

“That was a fantastic deal,” 

Kettwich said. “I guess I understand 
why they put us up so high, because 
it was a really good deal. I would 
certainly pay more to sit closer, 
though.”

Added Markwort: “The flat rate 

by itself really depends on how well 
Michigan does, but being able to 

go to any game they were in was a 
really good deal. You can’t find very 
many tickets in the arena for $20.”

As the Wolverines shift gears 

and look forward to playing their 
opening NCAA Tournament games 
closer to home in Indianapolis, 
their fans, especially students, are 
looking to hop on the bandwagon.

But something many students 

have come to realize since Sunday 
night is that it’s going to cost them 
one way or another to get on that 
wagon to Indiana.

On 
the 
Monday 
afternoon 

following the NCAA Tournament 
Selection 
Show, 
the 
Michigan 

Athletics Ticket Office released 
information via email to all student 
basketball season ticket holders on 
how to make requests for a small 
pool of tickets allocated to students 
for the games in Indianapolis.

The email detailed policies the 

ticket office had set up to process 
the allocation. Students who are 

granted a ticket would be required to 
show up at Bankers Life Fieldhouse 
in Indianapolis on Friday to claim 
their tickets with a valid MCard to 
both the game played that day, and 
a ticket for Sunday if Michigan were 
to advance. By submitting a request, 
a student would be committing to 
attend both the Friday and Sunday 
(if the Wolverines win Friday) 
sessions and could not purchase 
a ticket to one game without the 
other.

This policy causes a problem 

for students who have classes late 
Thursday night or Friday. Many 
students are unable to attend 
Friday’s game due to class conflicts 
and other academic priorities. An 
official in the Michigan Athletics 
Ticket Office confirmed there were 
many inquires made by students 
about purchasing tickets for just one 
session, but none were granted due 
to these policies.

The ticket office had also put 

in place a policy limiting ticket 

requests to students who are season 
ticket holders for this season. As 
MLive’s Brendan Quinn reported 
in December, student season ticket 
sales have declined 44 percent 
between the 2015-16 and 2016-
17 seasons. A number of factors 
have led to this decline, but this 
alarming trend will carry over into 
the postseason, as many students’ 
decision not to purchase season 
tickets will rule them ineligible for 
postseason ticket requests.

But 
nothing 
has 
deterred 

students from buying tickets more 
than the price they’re being asked 
to pay. The Michigan Athletics 
Ticket Office has little control over 
price, an official told the Daily on 
Wednesday. Rather, the NCAA sets 
prices when it passes on the tickets 
for the office to distribute. Michigan 
only profits off a $5 service fee it 
charges with every transaction. 
The price set for each ticket was 
$81, meaning if the Wolverines beat 
Oklahoma State on Friday, students 

who committed to buying the 
package will be charged $162 plus 
a service fee for tickets to the two 
games. For comparison, the cost for 
a student to purchase season tickets 
to the upcoming 2017-18 season is 
$175 for somewhere between 16 and 
19 home games.

That combination of policy, 

apathy and price created the 
perfect storm for an incredibly 
underwhelming number of ticket 
requests. According to a Michigan 
Athletics Ticket Office official, 
just 27 students requested the 
package by the 10 a.m. deadline on 
Tuesday.

An official from the office 

confirmed they had planned for a 
higher demand from students, and 
even warned in the original email 
that tickets were not guaranteed if 
the demand exceeded supply.

But that was never going to 

happen.

The extra tickets not claimed by 

students have since been turned 
over to the allocation reserved for 
the general public, which did have 
excess demand.

As for students, there certainly 

will be more than 27 of them 
attending Friday’s game at Bankers 
Life Fieldhouse. They’ll just have 
to look elsewhere, mainly on the 
streets or through online ticket 
exchanges, to be in attendance to 
see if the Wolverines’ postseason 
run continues.

Markwort 
and 
Kettwich 

won’t be two of them: the pair 
needs the weekend to catch up on 
schoolwork and patch up the hole 
burnt through their wallets after 
spending four days in Washington. 
But they feel they made the arena 
atmosphere better for everyone 
around them. 

It’s unfortunate many students 

like them won’t have the chance to 
do the same in Indianapolis.

“The people sitting around us 

were very receptive of us being 
there,” Markwort said. “Multiple 
people came us to up after the game 
and said, ‘We’re really glad you 
guys came here, thanks for making 
the trip, it was really cool.’ They 
definitely appreciated it.”

‘M’ to face Northern Illinois in 
first home series of the season 

Last Wednesday, when asked 

about Michigan baseball’s first 
series of the year at Ray Fisher 
Stadium, a jubilant smile filled 
the face of second baseman Ako 
Thomas. Yet, on a day when 
Michigan experienced record-high 
winds, the standout sophomore 
pleaded one simple wish for the 
upcoming series against Northern 
Illinois:

“Hopefully the weather isn’t too 

crazy.” 

Unfortunately for Thomas, his 

request did not become reality. 
The No. 21 Wolverines (12-3) 
will host the Huskies (3-12) amid 
frigid temperatures and potential 
snowfall. Current forecasts predict 
the high temperature for the 
weekend series to be 40 degrees 
Fahrenheit and the low to be 17 
degrees.

In fact, the teams were initially 

scheduled to commence their series 
on Friday. However, one of the 
doubleheaders slated for Saturday 
has been moved to Thursday as a 
result of the expected inclement 
weather.

Heading 
into 
the 
winter 

showdown, Michigan has been on 
a blaze – winning nine of their last 
10 games. During the first 15 games 
of the season the Wolverines have 
consistently outperformed their 
competition, 
outscoring 
their 

opposition 95 to 49.

In addition to the stable offense 

and pitching, Coach Erik Bakich 
points out that Michigan’s defense 
has played an integral role in the 
team’s early season success.

“I really like our defense,” 

Bakich said. “That’s an area we 
take a lot of pride in, playing good 
fundamental defense.”

While coach Bakich explains 

that “surprised is (not) the right 
word” when discussing the team’s 
high level of play on defense – the 
team currently ranks eighth in 
the NCAA with a .984 fielding 
percentage – it is an area that seems 
to have caught his eye, and perhaps 
even exceeded his expectations.

“From a coaching standpoint, 

our guys not only making the 
routine play, but making the web 
gem play has generated a lot of 
momentum for our team,” Bakich 
said.

In addition to their superb 

defense, one area that has also 
sparked the Wolverines this season 
is their success on the base path 
– Michigan ranks fourth in the 
country with 2.33 stolen bases per 
nine innings and sixth overall with 
35 total steals.

Bakich explains how this is a 

byproduct of the speedy personnel 
they have on the roster. He points 
out that while stealing bases is 
a great weapon to have, it is not 
necessarily something they hunt 
for.

“We don’t go into any game 

with a set number of stolen bases 
in mind,” Bakich said. “Really, 
who cares if we lead the nation in 
stolen bases or not, it really doesn’t 
matter.”

The 
duo 
that 
leads 
the 

Wolverines in stolen bases, Thomas 
and senior shortstop Michael 
Brdar, have nine and eight stolen 
bases respectively on the season. 
The duo feels the team has not only 

been more aggressive on the base 
path, but in all areas of the game.

This 
sort 
of 
intensity 
is 

something coach Bakich expects 
from his players:

“The players understand what 

the expectation level is, which is 
100 percent all the time,” Bakich 
said. “They’ve done a really nice 
job with it.”

Michigan will have to channel 

this intensity while playing in 
below freezing temperatures this 
weekend.

While Northern Illinois has 

found little success this season, 
winning just three games and 
boasting a subpar .232 batting 
average, they are coming off of a 
win and will undoubtedly look to 
steal a few games from the ranked 
Wolverines. The Huskies will turn 
to left-hander Donovin Smith – 
who last week was awarded the 
Mid-American Conference pitcher 
of the week – to try and defeat 
Michigan.

While on paper the Wolverines 

should be able to handle Northern 
Illinois, the inclement weather 
could prove to be an unpredictable 
element.
