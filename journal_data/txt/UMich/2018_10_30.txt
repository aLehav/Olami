begin to 

accept applications 
and deposits during the fall 
semester.

For 
many 
freshmen, 
the 

search for off-campus housing 
can begin only a few months into 
their college careers and can 

present many obstacles for those 
unfamiliar with the ins and outs of 
securing and negotiating housing 
contracts. 

“We’ve been working really 

hard to correct a misperception 
that you have to rush and be in a 
hurry to make a decision about 
your housing for the subsequent 
year,” she said. “We’re working 
really hard with landlords and 
city officials to make it more 
comfortable for you to know, at 
whatever time of the year is right 
for you, that you will be able to find 
housing that works for you.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Mikaela 

Uddfolk said she signed a lease by 
the end of October of her freshman 
year. Uddfolk, who is currently 
living in an off-campus apartment, 
said due to her plans to study 
abroad next year, the process has 
been significantly less stressful 

compared to 
her freshman year.

“I’m planning on finding 

a sublease for next year,” she said. 
“If I was just starting to look into 
housing now, to actually sign a 
lease, I think I’d be pretty stressed 
out.”

Uddfolk said it would be 

helpful if the University included 
information about the housing 
search during orientation so new 
students could be better prepared 
for it.

Among the other speakers at 

the event was Gayle Rosen, an 
attorney working for Student 
Legal Services, the University’s 
law office for students. Rosen is 
in charge of advising students 
in negotiating their leases and 
housing contracts.

“We do anything from renewing 

leases to helping you with security 
deposits, as well as helping you deal 
with construction, noise, eating 
issues, air conditioning issues and 

permitting 
emotional support 
animals,” Rosen said.

The event also included a 

question and answer session with 
student 
representatives 
from 

Beyond the Diag, the university’s 
program intended to “improve 
off-campus 
safety 
resources, 

communication, and education for 
UM students.” Jones specifically 
referred to the program in her 
comments, citing the support they 
provide to undergraduates.

“A lot of people think their 

problem or concern is a little too 
personal or specific to them,” 
Jones explained. “I want you to 
know that our help can be very 
personalized to your needs. If you 

With the midterm elections 

just around the corner, the 
University of Michigan chapter 
of 
College 
Democrats, 
the 

Roosevelt Institute and the 
Michigan 
Affordability 
and 

Advocacy Coalition hosted 

a 
panel 
Monday 

night 
to 

discuss 

and explain Proposal A to 
University 
students 
at 
the 

Ford School of Public Policy. 
Panel members included Mayor 
Chris Taylor, Councilmember 
Zack 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward 

3, and Public Policy Kellie 
Lounds, president of College 
Democrats.

Proposal A was introduced 

following the City Council’s 
approvalof the Library Lot 
development in June, with 
plans of creating a 17-story 

commercial 
development 

complex 
on 
top 

of 
the 
711 

Underground 
Parking 

Structure in downtown Ann 
Arbor. The building would 
include 43 affordable housing 
units, 
office 
spaces, 
hotel 

rooms and a public plaza. If 
passed, Proposal A would reject 
these development plans, and 
instead, propose the city builds 
an additional urban park and 
civic center commons. 

The panelists argued the $5 

million price tag of this park 
could 
instead 
be 
allocated 

towards 
affordable 
housing, 

which, 
according 
to 
the 

panelists, is a more pressing 
and relevant issue. Ackerman 
said with this new privately-

owned complex, students or 

Ann Arbor residents 

that 
use 

federal 

housing 
vouchers to pay their rent 
would be able to live in the 
central downtown area, rather 

than on the outskirts of the 

city.

“If we truly 

want to 

remain a diverse and inclusive 
community, 
housing 
is 
the 

crux of this entire equation,” 
Ackerman said.

Ackerman said this complex 

would bridge the gap between 
the adult population in the Main 
Street area with the student 

population in the State Street 

Students and faculty gathered 

in Palmer Commons at the 
University of Michigan Monday 
morning to listen to panelists 
describe the origins and mission 
of 
the 
Boycott, 
Divestment 

and Sanctions movement. The 
movement has always been a 
contentious issue on campus, 
but has become a rising issue 
recently 
after 
a 
Graduate 

Student 
Instructor 
and 
a 

professor 
declined 
to 
write 

letters of recommendation for 
students hoping to study abroad 
in Israel last month.

The panel was hosted by 

the Center for Middle Eastern 
and 
North 
African 
Studies. 

CMENAS 
director 
Samer 

Mahdy Ali opened up the event, 
first recognizing the tragedy 
of the shooting at the Tree of 
Life synagogue in Pittsburgh 
this past weekend. Ali then 
noted

As 
students 
begin 
the 

search 
for 
their 
housing 

arrangements for next year, 
the University of Michigan’s 
Central Student Government 
held a town hall Monday night 
to address the challenges of 
finding off-campus housing.

CSG 
president 
Daniel 

Greene, a Public Policy senior, 
began the town hall discussing 
the dynamics of student and 
landlord relationships.

“A lot of students blindly 

sign 
their 
lease,” 
Greene 

said. “They don’t know the 
information they should look 
out for, and a lot of students 
find themselves unsure of 
what to do when they have a 

conflict with their landlord 
or 
housing 
management 

company.”

Dean of Students Laura 

Blake Jones followed Greene, 
going 
into 
further 
detail 

about 
the 
resources 
that 

are 
available 
to 
students 

searching 
for 
help. 
The 

University offers resources 
including Tenant Rights and 
Responsibilities 
materials, 

Student Legal Services for 
issues with landlords and 
more.

“We’re 
committed 
to 

making sure that when you 
move off campus and go into 
residential environments that 
you have those that are among 
the highest quality,” Jones 
said. 
According 
to 
Jones, 

now is a stressful time for 
students, as many landlords

Ann 
Arbor’s 
highly 

partisan 
local 
elections 

make it an outlier among 
cities in Michigan, and City 
Councilmember Jane Lumm, 
I-Ward 2, wants to change 
that.

According to Lumm, only 

two other cities in Michigan 
— Ionia and Ypsilanti— have 
partisan local elections, while 
most have nonpartisan races, 
meaning candidates do not 
run as members of a particular 
political 
party. 
She 
also 

noted that Ann Arbor’s usual

and South University Avenue 
area. According to Ackerman, 
this building would fill an 
otherwise desolate area and 
give students walking home 
at night a greater sense of 
security.

The 
panelists 
explained 

even 
though 
the 
Library 

Lot 
development 
isn’t 
a 

comprehensive 
solution 
to 

affordable housing in Ann 
Arbor, this is a necessary first 
step in the process.

“With respect to affordable 

housing in the city of Ann 
Arbor, we have nowhere near 
enough of it,” Taylor said.

Many 
Ann 
Arbor 

residents who were vocal 
against Proposal A were in 
the audience and, though 
audience members were not 
allowed time to speak during 
the event, they passed out 
written materials to other 
audience members.

In a letter passed out, 

Ann Arbor resident Daniel 
Rubenstein said the housing 
and business complex would 
contribute 
to 
the 
urban 

clutter of downtown Ann 
Arbor and urged the audience 
to vote yes on the proposal.

“Unless we protect this 

parcel now, it is more than 
likely that we will never again 
have an opportunity to create 
public open space in the heart 
of downtown,” Rubenstein 
wrote.

LSA junior Yosef Gross, 

co-president of the Roosevelt 
Institute, said the event was 
intended to inform students 
and young voters of the 
implications of Proposal A.

“We think this is an event 

that 
is 
being 
portrayed 

in across Ann Arbor and 
through the ballot proposal 
question as an event about 
development and about a 
park, but really it’s … a ballot 
proposal 
about 
affordable 

housing and we wanted to 
make sure that students at 
the University of Michigan 
— people who are going to 
be voting on this — are clear 
about that,” Gross said.

First Year Experience, a 

division of the University of 
Michigan’s Office of Student 
Life, 
hosted 
“First 
Gen? 

First Year? Questions and 
Community” 
Monday, 
an 

event intended to help first-
generation students navigate 
their 
freshman 
years, 
in 

Couzens Multipurpose Room.

 
Two 
of 
the 
student 

coordinators, 
LSA 
junior 

Khanh Le and LSA sophomore 
Mariah Benford, voiced their 
opinions on what this event 

meant 
for 
first-generation 

students.

“There 
are 
definitely 

specific problems that first-
generation students have to 
go through and I think it’s 
for that,” Le said. “First-gen 
students make up a small 
population of overall students 
here. Problems that first-
gen students face can be 
overshadowed or ignored by 
bigger priorities.”

 
According 
to 
a 
2016 

campus 
climate 
survey, 

first-generation 
students 

constitute 8 percent of the 
student 
body. 
First-gen 

students in the past have 

said the coupling of lack 
of parental guidance and, 
typically, a low-income status 
has made the transition to 
higher 
education 
difficult. 

Benford said she “appreciated 
the fact that there’s a space 
for 
first-gen 
students,” 

especially 
through 
events 

such as Monday’s

In her opening remarks, 

Allie Harte, the associate 
director of FYE, said as the 
event marked the beginning 
of the first annual First Gen 
Week at the University, FYE 
wanted to help first-year 
students on campus in their 
first months at the University.

“First Year Experience 

really wanted to partner 
and be a part of that 
and 
provide 
resources 

and a place and space 
for communityfor first 
year, first-gen students 
specifically,” Harte said.

Several 
tables 
were 

set 
up, 
each 
focused 

on 
a 
different 
issue, 

and students had the 
opportunity to rotate to 
whichever table suited 
their concerns. One of 
the 
tables 
discussed 

housing, 
specifically 

finances and the pros and 
cons of different types of 
housing. LSA sophomore 
Alexandria Bly, a student 
coordinator for FYE, said 
the pressure of searching 
for 
housing 
was 
of 

particular 
concern 
for 

first-generation students.

“Housing next year is 

a big topic on campus,” 
Bly said. “This is probably 
one of the best programs 
we’ve had so far. Students 
are worried about a lot of 

things like ‘How am I going to 
get involved?’ but it’s not like, 
‘If I’m not involved, I’m going 
to be homeless.’”

 LSA freshman Richard 

Demeter said the event made 
him feel welcome at the 
University.

“I was a little worried about 

coming to a big university and 

not knowing what to expect,” 
Demeter said.

Nursing freshman Kaylee 

Johnson was able to benefit 
from 
other 
resources 

available.`

“I learned about a new 

course I could take and about 
community service,” Johnson 
said. “They should definitely 
do it again in the future.”

University kicks off first annual First 
Gen Week with community gathering

According to the ‘U’s 2016 campus climate survey, first-generation students make 
up 8 % of the student body, First Year Experience wants to serve as a resource


question CMENAS’s decision 
to hold an event discussing a 
movement some equate with 
anti-Semitism. He explained 
CMENAS 
decided 
BDS 
is 

too vital a movement to not 
be discussed, claiming the 
movement is against a racist 
institution rather than a group 
of people.

“Why hold an event like 

this 
after 
such 
a 
terrible 

tragedy?” Ali said. “Frankly, 
we considered canceling the 
event altogether. But violence 
is contagious … BDS is the 
most important global issue for 
thousands of students on the 
U-M campus. This nonviolent 
movement is part of who they 
are. BDS is not against any 
group, but against a racist 
structure 
that 
oppresses 

millions of people daily.”

The 
first 
speaker 
was 

Susan Abulhawa, a political 
commentator, 
poet 
and 

founder of Playgrounds for 
Palestine. 
Abulhawa 
began 

her presentation by reading 
aloud some of Israel’s laws. 
One of these was a law put 
into effect this summer, which 
declared Israel as the nation-
state of the Jewish people and 
downgraded Arabic from its 
official language status.

Abulhawa then talked about 

the history of Palestine and 
Zionism. Seventy years ago, she 
said, Palestine was a thriving, 
pluralistic 
country 
with 

sophisticated businesses and 
infrastructure. She said this 
changed with the introduction 
of Zionism, which was seen as a 
movement for Jews to return to 
a land devoid of a culture and 
a people. 

“They said it was a land 

without a people for a people 
without a land,” Abulhawa 
said.

She showed an image of 

an online recipe for falafel, 
calling it an Israeli dish. This, 
Abulhawa said, illustrates how 
Israel has co-opted Palestinian 
culture.

“You get to see this kind of 

stuff,” Abulhawa said. “Israeli 
cuisine, 
falafel, 
shakshuka, 

hummus, which has nothing 
to do with Israel. Not only has 
Israel stolen our home, and 
our lands and our dignity, and 
our heritage. But they’re also 
stealing our culture and our 
story and our history.”

Abulhawa 
continued 
to 

describe some of the Israeli 
government’s 
policies, 

including 
former 
prime 

minister 
Yitzhak 
Rabin’s 

instruction to Israeli soldiers 
to break Palestinians’ bones 
while he was the minister of 
defense. She said in response 
to these types of policies, and 
despite what she described as 
the U.S.’s perception of Israel 
as a start-up nation, protesters 
and 
activists 
in 
the 
BDS 

movement work to hold Israel 
accountable.

The next speaker, Israeli 

sociologist and activist Tom 
Pessah, spoke of the difference 
between 
anti-Semitism 

and what he called “anti-
Semitizing.” He delved into the 
history of anti-Semitism and 
explained anti-Semitizing is 
a way of equating criticism of 
Israel with the hatred against 
Jews.

“The most common response 

that you see is what I would call 
anti-Semitizing, which means 
casting the words and the 
deeds of the opponents of Israel 
as resembling traditional anti-

Jewish posts,” Pessah said. 
“This is a way of stigmatizing 
people as anti-Jewish in order 
to silence opposition.”

This conflation is bad for 

everyone, 
Pessah 
said. 
He 

said he believes strongly in 
solidarity and noted he has 
found 
that 
while 
working 

with the BDS movement — a 
movement which he said works 
to end the Israeli occupation 
— to recognize equality of 
Palestinians, 
and 
to 
allow 

Palestinian refugees to return 
home. Pessah said BDS is 
a strong opponent of anti-
Semitism.

“BDS has been a model of 

solidarity from my knowledge 
of 
participation 
in 
the 

movement,” Pessah said. “You 
see many Palestinians, many 
Jews, many Israelis working 
side by side, acknowledging 
the rights of Palestinians as 
we said. But also, the BDS 
movement has been outspoken 
in combating anti-Semitism.”

Huwaida Arraf, a civil rights 

attorney and co-founder of 
the 
International 
Solidarity 

Movement talked about state 
policies targeting institutions 
that participate in the BDS 
movement. Arraf explained the 
foundation BDS is built on.

“In 2004, Palestinian civil 

society, 
170 
organizations, 

unions, representing really all 

facets of Palestinian society, 
political factions came together 
and announced this call to 
the world to help us achieve 
our freedom by instituting 
the same kind of pressure on 
Israel that the world instituted 
against apartheid in South 
Africa that helped bring it to 
an end,” Arraf said.

Arraf 
encouraged 
the 

audience to research and verify 
anything her or the other 
panelists discussed in order 
to form their own opinions. 
But 
she 
said 
she 
expects 

independent 
research 
will 

affirm her points.

“Anything I’ve said here, I 

don’t expect you to take as a 
given — please go and research 
yourself to learn more about 
it,” Arraf said. “Anything that 
Susan said, anything that Tom 
said. We want people to do the 
research themselves and then 
I’m confident you will also sign 
on.”

In 
November 
2017, 
for 

the first time in the school’s 
history after years of attempts, 
Central Student Government 
passed a divestment resolution 
calling for the University to 
investigate several companies 
it had investments in which 
have contracts with the Israeli 
military. The Board of Regents 
later rejected the resolution.

One 
student 
later 
asked 

how the panelists felt about 
the incidents of faculty and 
staff 
members 
declining 

recommendation 
letters. 

Abulhawa denied these actions 
were discriminatory, as the 
professors 
had 
originally 

agreed to write the letters 
before learning they wanted to 
study in Israel.

“I don’t believe the professors 

were discriminating against 
the students,” Abulhawa said. 
“The professors were pointing 
out, they were discriminating 
against Israel if you want to 
call 
it 
discrimination. 
My 

understanding is that they 
had actually agreed to write 
recommendation 
letters 
for 

those students, but when they 
learned that these students 
were applying to a colonial 
institution, 
they 
exercised 

their conscience not to be party 
to that.”

After these recommendation 

letter incidents, Shay Vaughn, 
an administrative partner and 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
advocate in LSA, said she 
received many phone calls 
about this issue. That’s why 
she attended the panel — she 
hoped to learn how to support 
as many people through DEI as 
possible.

“When it comes to being the 

DEI advocate, I think there is a 
responsibility to know certain 
things, and I take that very 
seriously, so I shared this event 
out to everyone in the office,” 
Vaughn said. “I just really 
appreciate being allowed to be 
here.”

“benchmarks” — university 
cities like Berkeley, California; 
Austin, Texas; and Madison, 
Wisconsin — have nonpartisan 
local elections.

Since 
2015, 
Lumm 
has 

introduced 
three 
ballot 

proposals before City Council 
to allow voters to decide if 
they want to get rid of partisan 
city elections. Each time, her 
proposal was voted down. 
Her most recent attempt in 
July 2018 fell one vote short of 
making the November ballot.

“It 
is, 
frankly, 
very 

frustrating, because I think 
that while one can debate the 
merits of nonpartisan versus 
partisan 
local 
elections, 

there’s no argument that I can 
see for not allowing voters to 
decide the question,” Lumm 
said.

Lumm 
said 
nonpartisan 

elections 
would 
shift 
the 

focus 
from 
Democratic 

primaries 
held 
in 
August 

to 
the 
November 
general 

election, when voter turnout 
is typically higher.

“Ann Arbor is a clear outlier 

in holding local elections on a 
partisan basis. We’ve been an 
outlier for a very long time,” 
Lumm said. “… None of our 
traditional benchmarks have 
partisan local elections. So 
that fact, coupled with the fact 
that Ann Arbor residents have 
not had an opportunity in 60 
years to weigh in on this, are 
compelling reasons why this 
question about nonpartisan 
elections should, I think, be 
on the ballot.”

Lumm pointed out that 

despite the fact the council 
is 
composed 
primarily 
of 

Democrats, members still have 
disagreements and spirited 
debates over municipal issues, 
pointing out political parties 
are not particularly relevant 
in local races. She also said 
her efforts were not related 
to the fact that she is the only 
Independent on the majority-
Democratic City Council.

“This isn’t about me,” Lumm 

said. “Local elections are not 
philosophical, 
ideological 

issues where party matters. 
It’s best practice. We’ll have 
higher turnout, we’ll attract 
more 
qualified 
candidates. 

It would require more voter 
scrutiny on the issues or 
candidates’ positions on the 
issues and the candidates’ 
priorities, and those are all 
really good things. I think it’s 
just good government, and 
that’s why I think we should 
be doing this.”

Jeff 
Hayner, 
D-Ward 
1 

candidate, disregarded party 
affiliation when he ran as 
an 
Independent 
against 

incumbent Democrat Sabra 
Briere in 2013. Hayner said 
he did so to spend more time 

talking 
about 
the 
issues 

central to his campaign.

“I’ve 
been 
a 
registered 

Democrat since ’84,” Hayner 
said. “The Democratic Party 
is where it’s at. In 2013, I 
knew I didn’t really have a 
chance to win because the 
woman who held the seat 
was sort of a beloved figure 
in local politics. I ran as an 
Independent so I could go all 
the way to November and talk 
about two issues that I ran 
on, which hadn’t been talked 
about at the time, which was 
the Gelman plume — the 
dioxane plume that’s creeping 
under our city — and also our 
city’s woefully underfunded 

pension mandates.”

Hayner said he focused 

more 
on 
the 
issues 
than 

political ideology.

“I know we’re a heavily 

Democratic 
city 
— 
that’s 

pretty evident — but there’s 
all kinds of people that live 
here and some of them aren’t 
as interested in politics as 
issues, so I’m just more of an 
issues guy,” Hayner said. “I 
guess that would make me a 
moderate.”

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy, 
D-Ward 
1, 

announced she would not be 
seeking re-election in April, 
and endorsed Hayner, who 
then narrowly won the Aug. 
7 primary in a contentious 
race against Ron Ginyard, 
who was backed by Ann Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor. 

Ginyard, a retired financial 
adviser, faced criticism for his 
failure to vote in an election 
since moving to Ann Arbor 
four years ago, while Hayner 
received scrutiny over several 
uncouth tweets as well as his 
membership in the National 
Rifle Association.

“It was closer than I would 

have hoped since he had never 
voted, which I think is sort of 
a big red flag for a Democrat, 
you know, but people are 

involved and active,” Hayner 
said. “There was a lot of get-
out-the-vote efforts on one 
side or another. He had a 
backing 
from 
the 
current 

council majority, so you know, 
that’s a powerful lobby.”

In the general election, 

Hayner is facing off against 
Ryan Hughes, a Democratic 
Socialist. 
Hughes 
said 
he 

ended 
up 
running 
as 
an 

Independent rather than a 
Democrat because, by the 
time Kailasapathy announced 
she 
was 
not 
running 
for 

re-election, 
he 
felt 
there 

wasn’t enough time for him 
to 
marshal 
the 
resources 

necessary 
to 
compete 
as 

Democrat.

“I was worried if people 

saw the word ‘Independent’ 
on the ballot they would think 
I was just a Republican who 
was too ashamed to admit it or 
something like that,” Hughes 
said. “So I said, ‘I got to 
write Democratic Socialist on 
everything that I do.’ People 
have to know that’s what I 
stand for — I think this is the 
time and this is the place to be 
a Democratic Socialist right 
now.”

Hughes 
centered 
his 

campaign around the issue 
of affordable housing in Ann 
Arbor. He has called for the 
city 
to 
intervene 
directly 

to provide low-cost public 
housing. Hughes said there 
was a dichotomy between 
those 
who 
believed 
the 

problem 
could 
be 
solved 

with market forces alone and 
those who were preoccupied 
with concerns that building 
new housing would cause the 
price of existing housing to 
increase.

“That’s kind of been the 

spectrum of debate in the city, 
and I don’t think that either of 
those are very realistic plans, 
just in and of themselves,” 
Hughes said. “My whole point 
in running was kind of to say, 
there’s something else we 
could be doing. We could be 
tackling this problem more 
directly than either of those 
things will allow us to do.”

Lumm said she plans to 

introduce the ballot measure 
again after the November 
election, 
once 
the 
new 

members of City Council are 
seated.

“So in terms of next steps, 

where we go from here, I 
remain determined to provide 
voters 
an 
opportunity 
to 

decide 
this 
question 
and 

obviously 
I 
very 
much 

believe that we should afford 
residents the opportunity, not 
force folks to collect ballot 
signatures,” Lumm said. “If 
council 
rejects 
the 
ballot 

question for the fourth time, 
I am fully prepared to help 
folks obtain the necessary 
signatures.”

come in and seek the support, we 
will find a way to work with your 
concerns.”

Housing prices in Ann Arbor 

have long been on the rise. 
According to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, the median rate for rent 
in Ann Arbor has increased 14 
percent from 2010 to 2015 and now 
sits at approximately $1,075 per 
month. 

Last 
spring 
CSG 
received 

backlash 
for 
its 
Campus 

Affordability Guide, which offered 
tips to make University living 
more affordable. Suggestions such 
as cutting down on housekeeping 
services, 
laundry 
delivery 
or 

limiting impulse purchases were 
deemed out of touch by much 
of the student body. Students 
responded negatively to the Guide, 
calling it “out of touch.” Public 
Policy senior Lauren Schandevel 
and LSA senior Griffin St. Onge, in 
collaboration with other student 
groups, wrote an abridged guide 
called Being Not-Rich at UM 
which improved the advice from 

“So in terms 
of next steps, 
where we go 
from here, 
I remain 

determined to 
provide voters 
an opportunity 
to decide this 

question ”

Palestinians,

t’s a word you have read a 
million times, it’s a word 
you have used a million 
times, but you have no idea 
what it actually means. An 
initial reaction would be to 
say that “lol” isn’t actually a 
word, it’s an acronym. While 
it is true that in 1989, when it 
is believed that “lol” was first 
used, “lol” did literally mean 
“laugh out loud,” but it is hard 
to argue that is still the case.
Just quickly looking at my 
recent text messages “lol” has 
been used in the following 
ways: 
“Lol 
it’s 
nothing,” 
“Excellent lol,” “Maybe it’s 
not better for u lol?,” “I have 
never heard of him lol,” “lol 
no worries it’s on the second 
floor next to the reference 
room.” While all these texts 
are 
stripped 
from 
their 
context it is pretty clear that 
in none of these conversations 
“lol” was used to mean laugh 
out loud. So what does “lol” 
actually mean? And what role 
does it play in our language?
In a 2008 paper studying 
teen usage of acronyms and 
instant messaging language, 
researchers Sali Tagliamonte 
and Derek Denis find that 
“lol” is used “in the flow of 
conversation as a signal of 
interlocutor involvement, just 
as one might say mm-hm in 
the course of a conversation.” 
This understanding of “lol” is 
certainly useful and describes 
some of the ways “lol” is used. 
If a friend is in the middle 
of sending a series of texts 
telling a story, I often drop 
“lol” in the middle just to let 
them know that I am reading 
and keeping up with what they 
are saying. Tagliamonte’s and 
Denis’s definition, however, 
fails to describe how “lol” 
is being used in most of the 
sample 
texts. 
In 
“I 
have 

never heard of him lol,” the 
“lol” was not at all necessary 
to maintain the flow of the 
conversation, nor did it imply 
the idea of mm-hmm.
John 
McWhorter, 
a 
linguist 
at 
Columbia 
University, 
believes 
that 
“lol” 
“no 
longer 
‘means’ 
anything. Rather, it ‘does 
something’ — conveying an 
attitude — just as the ending 
‘-ed’ doesn’t ‘mean’ anything, 
but conveys past tense. “Lol” 
is, of all things, grammar.” 

McWhorter’s understanding 
of “lol” does a much better job 
of describing the wide variety 
of ways that “lol” is used. In 
all of the sample texts, “lol” 
was used as a way of implying 
a certain tone or adding a 
feeling to the text message.
McWhorter’s 
intuition, 
that “lol” is an attitudinal 
expression 
seems 
correct, 
but his theory can be further 
specified. 
What 
actually 
constitutes grammar is a 
highly theoretical and loaded 
discussion 
that 
linguists 
debate endlessly. “Lol,” in my 
view, should be understood as 
a “symbol” just like commas, 
colons 
and 
exclamation 
points. 
The 
purpose 
of 
symbols within our language 

is to help convey emotion 
and attitude of the delivery 
of words. For example, an 
exclamation point marks that 
something has been said with 
a special amount of vigor and 
emphasis. By adding “lol” 
to the end of “I have never 
heard of him,” I signaled 
to my friend that I had a 
slight bit of embarrassment 
about my ignorance. In the 
example of “Lol it’s nothing,” 
“lol” helped signal that my 
friend wanted to casually 
move on in the conversation. 
If the text read simply as 
“It’s nothing,” the level of 
seriousness and the overall 
mood of the conversation 
would have been a lot more 
unclear to me. 
As texting has become 
a more ubiquitous part of 
society, so has the new forms 
of language that texting has 
brought along with it. If 
my theory is correct — that 
“lol,” more than anything 
else, is used a symbol to help 
express emotion — what does 
the mean for the future of 
“lol?” Will “lol” escape the 
realm of digital messaging 
and seep its way into other 
linguistic contexts? Part of 
my intuitions leans towards 
yes — “lol” is often uttered 
in face-to-face conversation 
without hesitation. Another 
part of me, however, has a 
very hard time imagining a 
world where “lol” is used as 
a grammatical symbol in a 
novel or an article. If “lol” 
shows us one thing, it’s that 
language 
is 
flexible 
and 
unpredictable which means 
predicting 
the 
future 
of 
“lol” is a nearly impossible 
project.

Nostalgia’s place in popular culture
C

ertain 
senses, 
and 
certain media, can put 
you in the past. A rerun 
of “Tom and Jerry” takes me 
back to 5 years old, 
sitting on my long-
gone 
fabric 
couch, 
eating a peanut butter 
sandwich 
with 
my 
dad before afternoon 
kindergarten. 
This 
bittersweet 
feeling 
of 
nostalgia 
can 
be 
incited 
by 
the 
simplest 
of 
senses 
and can make you 
smile about a past 
memory while also longing for 
those good times. But scientists 
have explored the feeling and 
determined that nostalgia is 
an overall positive experience 
— not holding you in the past 
but rather lifting your spirits. 
Nostalgia 
provides 
a 
sense 
of continuity in your life and 
personality, which is something 
that can bring people peace with 
themselves. And because of this 
emotional pull of nostalgia, it’s 
no surprise that marketing 
officials and personal brands 
have been increasingly pulling 
on these feelings in exchange 
for profits.
One of the most prominent 
examples of this is the new 
wave 
of 
Disney 
live-action 
remakes, beginning with “Alice 
in Wonderland” in 2010, which 
was later joined by “The Jungle 
Book,” “Beauty and the Beast,” 
“Cinderella” and “Christopher 
Robin.” The films did quite 
well overall in the box office, 
with “Beauty and the Beast” 
hitting a record-breaking $170 
million in its opening weekend. 
These films, based on Disney 
cartoons, pull the attention of 
those who grew up watching 
the originals, a media-favorite 
from the childhood of both 
millennials and Gen Z. Due to 
their unprecedented success, 
Disney plans on producing 
at least five more live-action 
versions through 2020.
The use of nostalgia is not 
limited to media conglomerates 
like Disney. This marketing 
tool has been extended into 
the world of personal brands 

and online influencers. On 
social media accounts with 
large followings, “influencers” 
can be making well into six 
figures, and this is 
often dependent on 
viewership. 
Josh 
Peck, an actor best 
known for his role 
as 
Josh 
Nichols 
on 
the 
popular 
Nickelodeon 
show 
“Drake & Josh,” has 
moved his career 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
social 
media, 
becoming active on 
platforms like Instagram and 
YouTube. Peck has also created 
a close association with fellow 
influencer David Dobrik, who 
recently reunited Peck with his 
“Drake & Josh” costar Miranda 
Cosgrove. The resulting video 
got over 9.6 million views, is 
nearly double the average views 
for Dobrik’s content.
The use of nostalgia in an 

attempt to generate viewership 
and excite audiences has its 
place, but if taken too far can 
feel disingenuous. Disney, one 
of the six most influential 
media conglomerates in the 
United States, is consistently 
producing original content, 
however, a large portion of 
their current work stays based 
in these recreations. While 
the reboots are well done, it’s 
difficult not to see the trend of 
remakes increasing alongside 
box office sales. They know 
that nostalgia sells tickets. 
The authenticity of a reunion 
between childhood stars who 
have not seen each other for 

years can be questioned in the 
same way. But nostalgia gets 
clicks.
As a sentimental person, 
I enjoy these nostalgic media 
moments, and more often than 
not, they do draw me to certain 
content. The enjoyment of 
nostalgia is a natural response, 
which is why it remains an 
effective 
tactic 
despite 
its 
prominence 
in 
our 
media. 
And 
the 
content 
certainly 
can be artistic, thought out 
and strong. Not all nostalgic 
media is bad content, but it’s 
important that as consumers 
we 
acknowledge 
nostalgia’s 
new 
role 
as 
a 
marketing 
strategy in popular culture. 
At what point does nostalgic 
media stop being a worthwhile 
extension 
of 
the 
original 
content and instead begin to 
stifle authenticity?
Each 
use 
of 
nostalgia 
can be examined with these 
criteria, and it’s up to the 
consumer to determine the 
worthiness of these projects 
and whether or not they 
stand as strong pieces of 
content, outside the realm 
of the original. We have all 
seen a bad sequel or remake 
— the cult classic “Scream” 
did 
get 
three 
sequels 
— 
and those are the types of 
projects that simply try to 
profit off of the extension of 
a successful original. Media 
content is a blend of art 
and entertainment, but its 
greatest purpose has become 
making money. We live in an 
attention economy where the 
media is constantly vying for 
our viewership, and it’s no 
surprise that nostalgia has 
become so central in doing 
this. We need to become more 
active in our media decisions. 
Consumers should be more 
aware of their choices and 
understand the intentions of 
brands before they passively 
accept the recycled content 
coming across their screens — 
separating exciting nostalgia 
from lazy recreation.

Everybody wants to be famous

ELLERY ROSENZWEIG | COLUMN
L

ying on the couch side 
by side, my sister and 
I shoved potato chips 
into our mouths as we spent 
our 
Sunday 
afternoon 
watching 
a 
marathon of E! 
True Hollywood 
Story. During one 
of the episodes 
about the artist 
P!nk, her closest 
friends 
shared 
their memories of 
P!nk as a teenager 
and how she was 
given her iconic name. My 
sister paused the show and 
passed me the bag of potato 
chips, asking, “Who do you 
think would be interviewed 
about 
you 
in 
your 
True 
Hollywood Story?” Without 
any 
hesitation, 
I 
begin 
drafting out loud which family 
members, friends and teachers 
would 
tell 
stories 
about 
me because I had already 
fantasized about becoming a 
famous star.
When I was younger, I 
always thought I would grow 
up to be famous for some 
reason. I wasn’t sure exactly 
for what, but my dream was 
to be as a famous singer. I 
thought I would be discovered 
through all my beautifully 
awkward solos in choir or by 
a stranger finding my covers 
of songs on YouTube, just like 
Justin Bieber. However, here I 
am, somewhat grown up and 
not famous or well known for 
any of my spectacular talents. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Last week, when I was 
hanging out with a group of 
friends, one of them asked 
all of us what we would want 
to be famous for. We all had 
different answers, from visual 
arts, to music, writing and 
sports. Yet we still all have 
this dream to be known for 
our passions, crafts and skills. 
This 
piqued 
my 
interest, 
because how is it that we all 
established the same mindset 
that one day we would be 
famous for our work? Where 
did we get this idea or is it 
human nature to want to be 
well known and have a legacy?
Looking back at the media 
I consumed as a preteen, many 
of my favorite shows and 
movies were about normal kids 
who become famous for their 
different talents. For instance, 
Hannah Montana, the Jonas 
Brothers, the Naked Brothers 
Band and the Cheetah Girls 
all were about normal teens 
who also doubled as famous 
singers 
and 
musicians. 
In 
“iCarly,” three friends become 
well known on the internet for 
their web show. Seeing these 
storylines repeated over and 
over again has impacted the 
way I think about fame today.
Additionally, we grew up 

and are still living in the era 
of social media. There are 
famous people on varying 
applications such as YouTube, 
Vine, Instagram and 
Twitter 
accounts 
that people subscribe 
to 
and 
follow 
for 
updates. 
With 
all 
of 
these 
different 
platforms, 
there 
is 
this new culture of 
following, 
creating 
and posting content 
for others to see. But 
even everyday people 
are 
treating 
their 
normal accounts as if they 
maintain 
great 
viewership. 
For example, in the recent 
film “Eighth Grade,” main 
character Kayla has a YouTube 

channel where she has themed 
videos with advice and talks 
to the camera like she has a 
large following. We later find 
out she only has a small circle 
of friends.
Our 
commonly 
used 
applications 
have 
been 
updating so there is more 
audience user communication 
and interaction. For instance, 
the new “ask question” sticker 
available 
on 
Instagram 
stories allows people to ask 
you questions and you can 
post the responses or the 
ability to respond to stories 
by sliding into the direct 
message section. Also, normal 
people are being sponsored 
by different companies and 
posting about products for 
their 
followers. 
Accounts 
by everyday people changed 
from just for your friends 
into platforms or “influencer” 
pages 
for 
audiences 
of 
strangers or potential bosses 
to explore.
For most of us, we don’t 
have a big following and we 
only have our friends and 
family members interacting 
with our content. But we are 
still treating and preparing 
our accounts like they are 
made for a general audience. 
When I was younger, I was 
always nervous about posting 
things to Instagram and would 
spend large amounts of time 
going through my pictures 
to post the best one with 
the most creatively crafted 
caption — but in retrospect, 
there was no reason for me 
and my friends to spend so 

much time on one picture that 
someone is just going to scroll 
through in a second.
Reflecting 
on 
this 
occurrence, it reminded me 
of a theory that I learned in 
my developmental psychology 
class 
called 
“adolescent 
egocentrism.” 
During 
adolescence, 
teens 
feel 
as 
if they are the center of the 
world. 
During 
this 
stage, 
adolescents can experience 
a feeling of an imaginary 
audience, where they feel like 
everyone is paying attention 
to their appearance, actions 
and 
behaviors. 
Also, 
they 
may experience the personal 
fable, where they think their 
experience 
is 
incredibly 
unique and no one is having a 
similar experience.
These 
theories 
explain 
why my friends and I spent 
so much time and energy 
thinking about how others 
would perceive our posts and 
the content we were posting 
online. But the truth is that 
you are probably the only 
one spending time on your 
page and others are not even 
thinking about your content 
for that long. Our culture right 
now seems to highlight those 
with the most likes and views, 
but not everyone is going to 
have a large following. So 
instead of spending time and 
energy crafting content for 
others, you might as well post 
your content for yourself.
As 
I 
am 
writing 
this 
column, 
I 
have 
the 
song 
“Everybody 
Wants 
To 
Be 
Famous” 
by 
the 
band 
Superorganism repeating in 
my head. It is really catchy 
and highlights the point that 
everyone does want to be 
famous and have their name 
well-known — but what is 
the cost? We spend so much 
time thinking about how to 
make ourselves well-known 
and 
remembered. 
I 
find 
myself dropping my handle 
(cough cough, @elleswag) and 
writing my name all over the 
place when I have the chance. 
I think this is just the hope 
that the things we create 
and impact we make in our 
field, community and world is 
recognized and used because 
then all of our efforts would 
be worthless.
So, instead of spending 
our time and energy creating 
and doing things for others to 
enjoy and consume, consider 
thinking about sharing your 
talents 
and 
skills 
because 
you love doing them. You 
may become well-known and 
famous from this, but it is 
probably better for your own 
motivation, 
well-being 
and 
time.

Ironically 
enough, 
with 

the release of Be The Cowboy, 
Mitski’s most experimental 
and 
pop-inflected 
album 

to date, Mitski has finally 
become the true rock ‘n’ roll 
star she was clearly born to be. 
Untethered from her guitar 
with a full band and backing 
tracks, 
Mitski 
completely 

owned the stage and attention 
of the audience, diving deep 
into the emotionality of her 
music with a newly developed, 
incredibly 
intense 
stage 

presence. 
In 
an 
interview 

with The Fader, Mitski said, 
“How can I use my voice as 
an instrument and make this 
interesting?” and she delivers 
on all fronts when it’s the only 
instrument she’s focusing on.

Only 
limited 
by 
the 

struggling sound system of 
a club venue like The Magic 
Stick, 
Mitski 
brought 
her 

new material to life this past 
Tuesday among a surprising 
number of deep cuts from her 
earlier 
material, 
including 

tracks 
like 
“Townie” 
and 

“First Love / Late Spring,” 
closing with “Goodbye, My 
Danish Sweetheart,” which 
elicited much screaming and 
excitement from the crowd. 
Surprisingly, 
Mitski 
only 

has three full-length studio 
albums under her name, yet her 
21-song set felt surprisingly 
evolutionary for such a young 
artist; she flashed all of her 
best facets within an hour 
and a half, revealing growth 
not only in songwriting but in 
performance as well.

Yet, this is precisely the 

unfortunate 
paradox 
of 
a 

Mitski 
performance: 
She 

played a full set spanning her 
entire career, and it still left 
me wanting more. This isn’t 
to the fault of the artist, but 
speaks more to the fact that 
the only way to be satisfied 
by a Mitski set is a full three 

hours to perform her entire 
catalogue. I was heartbroken 
that “Fireworks” had lost its 
spot in her setlists, while I 
heard others mourn the losses 
of “A Burning Hill” and “Texas 

Reznikoff.” Simply put, she’s 
that talented, and while her 
set 
perfectly 
exemplified 

her growth as an artist, her 
individual 
tracks 
are 
too 

nuanced to not notice when 
they’re missing.

Regardless of these selfish 

tendencies 
of 
her 
fans, 

Mitski’s 
live 
performances 

are spectacular, and her vocal 
abilities and new emotional 
investment 
in 
movement 

contribute to her magnetic 
nature. Her control of volume 
in particular weighed heavily 
on the room’s atmosphere; she 
can just as easily overpower 
the 
room 
with 
bellowing, 

soaring vocals like those of 
“Geyser” as she can softly tease 
out sadness and nostalgia as 
witnessed during “Two Slow 
Dancers,” which completely 
silenced the crowd.

While her older songs more 

or less carry an indie-rock 
sound with them, her newer 
material added the perfect 
amount of diversity to her 
setlist. 
Playing 
“Washing 

Machine Heart” only three 
songs into the set, the crowd 
bobbed 
and 
swayed 
with 

the 
disjointed 
synth 
and 

drum lines, which perfectly 
accent her soft ruminations 
before the song falls into an 
elegant melody over it all. 
It’s an aching song masked 
in some of the most inventive 
pop music written this year, 
and her delivery perfectly 
mirrored this. She proceeded 
to pull this off several more 
times, especially with singles 
“Geyser” and “Nobody” which 
both pull from a similar vein 
of songwriting style.

Having sold out The Magic 

Stick weeks in advance of the 
concert, it’d be shocking if 
Mitski doesn’t start to take 

I am 16 years old, standing 

on 
West 
40th 
Street 
in 

Manhattan, 
freezing 
and 

naive. There’s a Dec. chill in 
the air, a longing beating in my 
chest and a day-of Broadway 
ticket burning a hole through 
my jacket pocket. My hands 
reach for the door in front of 
my wide eyes and pink nose 
and I exhale. I stare up at the 
published plays and musicals 
lining the shelves and wonder 
what it would take to get my 
name printed down one of the 
slim, glossy spines. In that 
moment, I commit myself to 
the goal of making it here. This 
is my first time in New York 
City’s The Drama Book Shop. 

Anyone 
who 
knows 
me 

knows that my two greatest 
loves are theatre and books. 
I cannot choose between the 
two, because they share my 
affection 
both 
passionately 

and evenly. If you get me 
started on either topic, I’m 
likely to never stop ranting on 
some romantic diatribe about 
one or the other or both. The 
Drama Book Shop marries the 
comfort and security I feel in 
a bookstore with the magic 
and passion the theatre brings 
me. They have 8,000 original 
plays in stock — waiting to 
be read, waiting to be picked 
up, waiting to live. The shop 
nurtures and sponsors new 
and established playwrights 
alike with a 50-seat theatre 
in 
the 
basement 
for 
new 

performances, workshops and 
trial runs. It’s a theatre inside 
a bookstore — one inside of the 
other, like the Russian doll of 
my dreams. Walk through the 
front doors and be in the arms 
of the playwright — ready to 
be transported to whatever 
world you so choose as you 
scan the shelves. Moments 
later, descend a flight of stairs 
and be removed from reality 
entirely as you’re inspired 
and pushed as an artist and 
a human being. New work is 
enthralling. It is imaginative 

and 
energizing. 
There 
is 

no place quite like this one 
anywhere in the world. When 
I’m leaving The Drama Book 
Shop, my backpack weighed 
down by a few new plays and 
perhaps another book or two 
that caught my eye on my 
way to the checkout, I wish to 

bottle up the feeling the place 
gives me. For the fear and the 
knowledge that there’s no 
other place like it in the world. 

The 
Drama 
Book 
Shop, 

for me and for so many other 
creators, is what some call 
a home away from home. 
The people who have passed 
through those doors — artists, 
visionaries, 
appreciators, 

designers and tourists — all 
share a universal love for 
theatre. This is not your normal 

bookstore; it is the safe haven 
for theatre lovers and readers. 
It is specifically unique and a 
wild idiosyncrasy: a bookstore 
for 
plays, 
bulletins 
with 

audition listings lining the 
wooden walls, musical scripts, 
biographies, 
guides 
and 

history books filling the place 
like air. This store is a staple in 
the theatre community. It has 
thrived in Manhattan for over 
100 years. Like oxygen and 
water, it fulfills a specific need 
for so many of us. Theatre 
people need to be brought 
together with other theatre 
people because collaboration 
is where the magic happens. 
Theatre 
people 
understand 

the rise and fall, the trial and 
error, the effortless pushing 
and pushing and pushing to 
break through into something 
magnificent. 

So it comes as a heartbreak, 

and somewhat of a personal 
tragedy for me, to see that 
The Drama Book Shop has had 
to announce that it is being 
forced out of its home (not 
its first location, but the only 
location I’ve ever known) due 
to New York’s classic rising 
rents. Patrons and theatre-
goers and customers of the 
shop have flooded the store’s 
moderately-sized 
interior 

since, 
declaring 
they 
will 

spend as much money as they 
can to attempt to make even 
the smallest dent in the shop’s 
rent cost. In addition, Lin 
Manuel Miranda, who wrote 
much of “In The Heights” in 
that very The Drama Book 
Shop basement, stopped by the 
store recently to sign copies 
of everything with his name 
on it. But even then, with this 
outpouring of support, the 
owners are unsure if they’ll be 
able to stay afloat. 

For 
some 
people, 
Pete 

Davidson and Ariana Grande’s 
breakup or Kim Kardashian 
losing a diamond earring in a 
tropical destination overseas 
hits hard, but in the past few 
days, I’ve held back tears more 
than once thinking of one of 
my favorite places in the world 
closing its doors, potentially

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
A love letter to New York City’s The Drama Book Shop

for good. As a playwright 
and a theatre creator and an 
avid reader, I’m constantly 
terrified nobody will ever 
read my plays or stories, and 
that one day soon there will 
be nowhere to see them on 
shelves. I wonder where the 
childhood dream of being 
published on a shelf at The 
Drama Book Shop will go long 
after they’re gone. I wonder 
what young playwrights are 
supposed to do in a world that 
doesn’t seem to be buying 
enough 
plays. 
I 
wonder 

how we’re supposed to find 
communities or little safe 
havens in cities as large and 
looming as New York, if our 
safe spaces are struggling 
to survive. I wonder what 
this says about our society 
— one where it’s becoming 
increasingly easier to choose 
online ordering to standing 
outside on a cold Dec. day and 
waiting for The Drama Book 
Shop to open. Everything is an 
iPhone click away — all of our 
books and words and human 
moments. I fear there’s no 
solution. 

I want my children to see 

The Drama Book Shop and I 
want them to get the feeling I 
do when I go there: empowered 
as an artist, thrilled that 
places exist to celebrate our 

artistry 
and 
excited 
that 

there are communities for 

burgeoning 
playwrights. 
I 

want so desperately for my 

children to know book shops 
— independent book shops 
— or something, anything 
other than Amazon Prime. I 
feel foolish by adding to the 
problem. How easy it is to 
send myself books and plays 
from the comfort of my bed, 
and I feverishly and angrily 
decide to stop doing it all 
together. I need to walk to a 
bookstore, to open the door 
and feel at home in its warm 
glow, a feeling I lose when I 
order online. I am terrified 
that we are going to Amazon-
Prime away the experience 
of independent bookstores. I 
wonder again if there’s a way 
to bottle up the feeling of The 
Drama Book Shop so I can hold 
it near when I’m longing for it 
halfway across the country, or 
in a few months, when it says 
its forced goodbyes. 

But more than this, and 

maybe selfishly so, I’m sad that 
there’s a very real potential 
that I’ll never have the chance 
to see my own plays lining a 
shelf. That there will never 
come a day that a young, naive, 
freezing-cold girl with a day-
of Broadway ticket burning a 
hole in her pocket stares up 
at my name printed on the 
sleek, slim spines, wondering 
if maybe one day, that will be 
her, too. 

I wonder 

how we’re 

supposed to find 

communities 

or little safe 

havens in cities 

as large and 

looming as New 

York, if our 

safe spaces are 

struggling to 

survive

Mitski only 

has three full-

length studio 

albums under 

her name, yet 

her 21-song set 

felt surprisingly 

evolutionary for 

such a young 

artist; she 

flashed all of 

her best facets 

within an hour 

and a half

her shows to larger venues 
that can better accommodate 
her demanding vocal range 
and complex arrangements. 
But for now, she continues to 
put out incredible work that is 

deeply moving to see delivered 
live. Mitski is an artist that 
has proved her dedication to 
her art time and time again, 
and it seeps into every aspect 
of her shows, from her dancing 

and singing to her interaction 
with the crowd. Mitski is truly 
loved by her fans, and based 
on last week’s performance, 
it’s likely she truly loves them 
back.

Where to begin? The new 

“Heathers” 
has 
a 
simple 

message: 
People 
from 

marginalized groups do not 
deserve to have confidence and 

should be stopped at all costs. 
That’s it. Roll credits. I had my 
suspicions that this would more 
or less be the central message 
undercutting the “Heathers” 
reboot, but I decided to watch it 
for myself before I crucified it.

It’s crucifying time.
Just in case everyone else 

forgot (like the showrunners 
clearly did), the pitch-black 
humor of the 1987 “Heathers” 
solely 
worked 
because 
the 

victims 
of 
the 
murders 

themselves were horrendous 
people. 
They 
were 
hyper-

privileged, 
conventionally 

attractive, evil embodiments 
of 
the 
conformist, 
white 

suburban culture the movie 
set out to skewer. The three 
Heathers and their comrades 
having 
enormous 
privilege 

is a non-negotiable factor in 
constructing 
the 
humor 
of 

the movie, which is why the 
universe took a collective side-
eye when it was announced 
that the new eponymous clique 
would be re-cast with actors 
who all come from a different 
marginalized group.

Blonde-haired, 
blue-eyed, 

statuesque Heather Chandler 
has been reimagined as plus-
sized and androgynous, yet 
her 
cold 
persona 
remains. 

However, rather than her evil 
energies being directed at nerds 
and losers, it is being directed 
at a popular jock for wearing a 
culturally insensitive shirt. And 
we’re supposed to hate her. The 
new Heathers are rounded out 
by Heather McNamara (Jasmine 
Matthews, 
“Sweetbitter”), 

now a lesbian of color, and a 
genderqueer 
Heather 
Duke 

(Brenden Scannell, “Bonding”). 
As aforementioned, the choice 
to “diversify” the Heathers was 
eyebrow-raising, 
a 
decision 

that felt like a case of good-
intentioned 
tone-deafness 

at best. The episode quickly 
contradicted this perception.

It is very clear that we are 

supposed to hate the Heathers 
for 
supposedly 
using 
their 

“differences” to guilt people 
into making them popular. 
Icky. This pilot represents a 
stark 
misunderstanding 
of 

what 
marginalized 
groups 

mean 
in 
terms 
of 
better 

representation and inclusion 
in media. It also proves to be a 
missed opportunity for quality 
content. The new “Heathers” 
could have easily been a satire 
on disingenuous allyship that 
exposed the vapidness that 
so often lingers beneath the 
surface. Instead, “Heathers” 
is an unfunny mess where our 
villains are minorities who dare 
enough to not take anyone’s 
shit, and our “sympathetic” 
protagonist, Veronica, (Grace 
Victoria Cox, “Twin Peaks”) is 
a self-important white woman. 
Go figure.

In addition to the weak 

foundation the show is built 

upon, it also fails to take a solid 
stance on anything. It attempts 
to mimic Ryan Murphy’s acerbic 
wit found in the first seasons of 
“Glee” and “Scream Queens,” 
but fails miserably — primarily 
because from scene to scene it is 
unclear what they are arguing 
for or against. Veronica calling 

Heather Chandler “fatty” is 
supposed to be lauded, and J.D. 
(James 
Scully, 
“Quantico”), 

who for some reason is in 
possession 
of 
serious 
Nazi 

paraphernalia, is still treated as 
the unquestionable, smoldering 
hottie.

For 
a 
show 
that 
so 

desperately 
wants 
to 

distinguish itself from its 
movie predecessor, it still 
allows the 1987 film to do most 
of the heavy lifting when it 
comes 
to 
characterization. 

Viewers who have no prior 
knowledge of the movie would 
be deeply confused by many 
elements of the pilot episode. 
Character 
relationships, 

personalities and motivations 
are murky and hastily thrown 
at the audience. For example, 
in the movie, Veronica latches 
onto J.D. after he pulls a gun 
on bullies Kurt and Ram; in 
the show, J.D. just randomly 
approaches 
Veronica, 
a 

member of a top clique. Based 
on the politics of Woodcrest 
High School that the show 
itself presented to us, this 
feels unrealistic. In addition 
to J.D. and Veronica’s torrid 
relationship feeling rushed 
and 
contrived, 
Veronica’s 

urge to kill Heather Chandler 
comes 
across 
as 
baseless. 

A movie should not feel as 
though it has better pacing 
than a show that has nine 
episodes to lay everything out.

Hopefully, 
the 
havoc 

“Heathers” is wrecking on 
television will be limited to 
the nine episodes already 
released. Not only is the show 
irresponsible in many of its 
“daring” social stances, but 
also the show has nowhere 
else to go. “Heathers” is a 
narrative best told with a clear 
ending in sight, and with the 
pointless plotlines the show is 
opening up, I fear what else is 
next.

TV REVIEW

“Heathers”

Series Premiere

Paramount 
Network

Keira 
Knightley 
(“The 

Imitation 
Game”) 
and 

European period dramas go 
hand in hand. Whether she 

takes on the role of Elizabeth 
Bennett or Anna Karenina, 
Knightley delivers wittiness 
and 
sells 
the 
historical 

throwback 
with 
ease. 
She 

could be a time traveler, an 
actress actually born in the 
1800s and 1900s, sent to the 
future to give audiences a taste 
of life before computers and 
social media and clubbing.

Set at the turn of the 

20th 
century, 
“Colette” 

follows Gabrielle Colette, the 
true author of the popular 
French 
Claudine 
novels, 

and 
her 
husband, 
Henry 

Gauthier-Villars, 
pen 
name 

Willy (Dominic West, “The 
Square”). Willy has relied on 
ghost writers for his success, 
approaching literature as a 
marketing 
challenge 
rather 

than 
an 
artistic 
pursuit. 

When bills pile up and he 
can 
no 
longer 
afford 
the 

men who wrote his earlier 
works, he turns to his wife, 
Colette. Colette draws from 
her memories and deepest 
thoughts 
to 
create 
what 

Willy initially rejects: the 
most popular book in France, 
particularly 
among 
women 

readers. However, since Willy 
publishes the book and its 
sequels under his own name, 
Colette receives none of the 
acclaim or credit.

The great American (or 

British) novel has always been 
a 
male-dominated 
pursuit. 

The lists of classic “greats” 
usually showcase white men 
like Ernest Hemingway, Tom 
Wolfe and Jonathan Franzen. 
“Colette” dives into the psyche 
of this obsession, showing 
Willy’s views of what makes 
a book enjoyable — plot, sex, 
action — versus Colette, who 
focuses instead on literary 
elements. Willy wants a story 
about school girls for the 
fantasy-fulfillment 
factor, 

while 
Colette 
wishes 
to 

connect with her readers and 
convey her personal truths.

Along 
the 
way, 
Colette 

discovers a taboo truth about 
herself: She does not solely love 
men. As Willy openly pursues 

other women, so does Colette. 
Their 
marriage 
reaches 
a 

surprisingly progressive state 
where the two spouses carry 
out affairs and inform one 
another. However, as Colette 
soon realizes, she is still an 
oppressed woman. Willy only 
allows her to take on female, 
not male, lovers, and does 
so in the hope of sparking a 
higher rate of production for 
the Claudine novels. “Colette” 
explores the hidden LGBTQ+ 
community 
in 
the 
early 

1900s 
with 
simultaneously 

refreshing 
casualness 
and 

an alarming lack of politics. 
Although 
Colette 
and 
her 

trans lover are harassed at a 
show, the film does not address 
how the society as a whole 
treated or was aware of non-
heterosexual relationships.

“Colette” suffers from trying 

to cover a large period of time, 
but does justice to the woman 
who was almost written out of 
history. Knightley carries the 
weight of the film, appearing 
in nearly every scene and 
making a lasting impression 
in 
one 
particular 
uncut 

monologue. She embodies the 
role with thoughtfulness and 
a quiet rage. Knightley and the 
real life Colette remind the 
world why women should not 
be ignored.

“Taking the Arrow Out of 

the Heart” is the first bilingual 
poetry book of Alice Walker’s 35 
published and prolific works. The 

first female African American 
winner of a Pulitzer Prize in 
fiction, Walker’s writing shows 
all the marks of a revered author, 
poet and activist; each poem is 
eloquent, honest and touching. 
Many 
admirers 
recognize 

Walker for her work in “The 
Color Purple,” a novel tracing the 
life of Celie, an African American 
girl who is impregnated by 
her stepfather. In “Taking the 
Arrow Out of the Heart,” Walker 
once more explores themes of 
feminism and humanity, while 
writing with a sense of urgency 
for 
action 
and 
constructive 

contemplation. If Mother Earth 
could form audible words, they 
would be the words of Walker 
in “Taking the Arrow Out of the 
Heart.”

Walker chooses to opt out of 

polarized political circles, but 
makes it clear she is on the side of 

the oppressed. Through poetry, 
Walker 
replaces 
bereavement 

for 
the 
past 
with 
valuable 

fragments of hope for the future, 
but she makes clear that a better 
humanity is only feasible through 
immediate action against past 
wrongdoings. Her words lead 
you towards the light, but doing 
that involves a sense of humanity, 
sorrow and action against the 
darker shades that infiltrate the 
world at large. With poems for 
the children of Palestine, Iraqi 
women, the mothers of police 
brutality victims and many more 
oppressed 
groups, 
Walker’s 

words of sorrow and redemption 
account for all forms of oppression 
against 
the 
intersections 
of 

marginalized people globally. 
She further memorializes artists, 
activists and other brave fighters 
of oppression and injustice, like 
Martin Luther King Jr.

Walker 
recognizes 
the 

deprivation of all forms of life 
beyond humans with lines like 
“Anybody 
who 
assassinates 

rivers, oceans, and the air, is not 
from here. / You can sleep on if 
you like. But this is the easiest 
way to tell who is not Earthling.” 
Alice Walker is not blindly 
optimistic, but rather pragmatic 
and compassionate. She asks if 
dreams for the future are at the 
climax of possibility with the 
following questions: “Is it the 
peaceful nation in which every 
child is wanted and adored; 
where every woman has a voice? 
Where every man’s dignity is 
rooted in nonviolence?” 

Walker further interrogates 

power structures that employ 

privileges to favor some while 
leaving 
others 
silenced 
and 

unheard. She rightly confirms 
that 
people 
who 
have 
the 

privilege to ignore the disparities 
faced by so many are basking 
in ignorant grandeur and not 
stepping up to the plate of dignity 
for humankind.

Within the 70 poems in 

“Taking the Arrow Out of the 
Heart,” lines like “Blackness is 
not where whiteness wanders 
off to die: but that it is like the 
dark matter between stars and 
galaxies in the Universe that 
ultimately holds us together” 
really stick out. These lines are 
from the poem “Here It Is,” 
commemorating Jesse Williams’s 
(you may also recognize him as 
Dr. Avery from the TV series, 
“Grey’s Anatomy”) speech after 
winning 
the 
Humanitarian 

Award at the 2016 BET Awards 
for his work with the Black 
Lives Matter movement. Walker, 
like Williams, refuses to define 
Blackness as the absence of 
whiteness, and further speaks to 
eliminate “fear of Blackness in 
white culture.”

“Taking the Arrow Out of the 

Heart” is a four leaf clover for 
all activists and fighters against 
injustice needing a glimmer of 
hope. Alice Walker writes with 
patience and understanding, but 
remains demanding while posing 
reformative thoughts. Kind but 
necessary; grateful but urgent. 
Walker doesn’t just capture the 
reader’s attention — she pulls 
you soothingly against her chest 
and gets right to the heart of the 
matter.

Mel Pearson adjusting to new NCAA rule allowing an extra skater

After 36 years of coaching 
college 
hockey, 
Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson is learning 
something new.
For the 2018-19 season, the 
NCAA increased the number of 
skaters each team is allowed to 
have dressed for a game from 
18 to 19. So, for the first time, 
Pearson has to balance an extra 
level of decision-making when 
he’s setting his lineup.
“I’ve gone 36 years in college 
hockey with a certain way, and 
now all of a sudden you have 
an extra body,” Pearson said. “I 
think it’s taken me and will take 
me a little time to learn how to 
really maximize that position 
and get the most out of them.”
Five games into the season, 
the No. 12 Michigan hockey 
team (3-2) has had different 
lineups almost every night. 
Other than keeping the same 
skaters for two games against 
Western Michigan, Pearson has 
made a different decision about 
his 19th skater for the other 
three games.
In the first game against 
Vermont, freshman forward Jack 
Randl saw his first collegiate 
action as the 13th forward. 
Against the Broncos, freshman 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
earned his first two starts. And 
in last weekend’s series against 
St. 
Lawrence, 
two 
different 
forwards — freshman Jimmy 
Lambert 
and 
junior 
Adam 
Winborg — saw time as the extra 
man on the line chart.
Lambert was listed as the 
19th man on Friday night, after 
playing on the second and third 
lines in the previous four games. 
Saturday, he was back in his spot 
as the right winger on a line with 
senior forward Brendan Warren 
and redshirt sophomore forward 
Luke Morgan and Winborg made 
his season debut.
The frequent changes are all 

part of Pearson’s plan to figure 
out the best way to use the extra 
skater and create competition 
amongst his players.
“We just want to give everyone 
an opportunity to see what we 
have,” Pearson said. “We just 
want to create some competition 
and some players have played 
well, so we give them the 
opportunity to get in the lineup.”
In Saturday’s game, Pearson 
scratched 
freshman 
forward 
Nolan 
Moyle, 
sophomore 
forward 
Dakota 
Raabe 
and 
junior defenseman Griffin Luce. 

And while Pearson wanted to 
reward players who deserve an 
opportunity, he has a hard time 
taking players out of the lineup.
“You have to reward guys who 
have played well in practice,” 
Pearson said. “It’s always hard 
taking somebody out. It’s easy 
to throw somebody in, but it’s 
always hard to take somebody 
out.
“The guys we took out didn’t 
necessarily have a bad game, 
like I thought (Moyle) had 
maybe his best game for us. We 
just want to continue to create 

some competition and get them 
to push each other and one of 
the best ways to do that is by 
changing the lineup.”
The addition of a 19th skater 
complicates the already-difficult 
process of setting a lineup. It 
gives an extra chance to play 
someone who has worked hard 
and is ready for an opportunity, 
but 
it 
also 
creates 
more 
ambiguity. Adding a forward 
without a line or a defenseman 
without a partner adds a layer 
of complexity to the decision of 
who to play at what times.

That difficulty showed itself 
Saturday night, as Winborg — 
dressed for the first time all 
season — was listed as the 13th 
forward. Pearson planned to play 
him on the penalty kill, but the 
Wolverines were penalized only 
one time in the game.
“We thought he was more of a 
specialty player that’s gonna kill 
penalties for us,” Pearson said. 
“Then we had one penalty again, 
and I didn’t get (Winborg) in the 
game, which I felt bad about.
“He’s earned a chance to play. 
He played last year for us in the 

Frozen Four, so he’s not a bad 
hockey player, we just gotta find 
a way to get him in and get him 
involved. That’s on me.”
The addition of the 19th 
skater 
offers 
Pearson 
more 
opportunities to get players 
like Winborg involved. It gives 
space on the bench for a penalty 
kill or power play specialist but 
figuring out who those players 
are takes time.
And after 36 years as a coach, 
Pearson is taking his time to 
figure out the best way to use his 
extra man.

EVAN AARON/Daily
Michigan coach Mel Pearson has had to adjust, in his 36th season, to the new NCAA rule for the 2018-19 season which allows teams to employ a 19th skater on the ice for each game.

Michigan has used four different players in its first five games as the 19th skater allowed on the ice

Wolverines finish fall 
season on strong note

Puddled 
greens 
coupled 
with flashes of thunder and 
lightning plagued the course 
for the Michigan women’s golf 
team. Over the weekend, the 
Wolverines finished their fall 
season at what was supposed 
to be a three-day tournament 
at the Landfall Tradition in 
Wilmington, North Carolina. 
They got called off the course 
on Friday due to weather, 
and 
the 
tournament 
was 
suspended 
until 
Saturday 
morning. 
Though 
these 
poor 
weather 
conditions 
might 
have 
actually 
been 
an 
advantage for 
Michigan. The 
Wolverines 
are 
used 
to 
getting 
their 
paws 
wet 
and 
playing 
through rough conditions.
“Being from Michigan, we 
get the chance to practice in 
these rough conditions,” said 
Michigan coach Jan Dowling. 
“We really just stayed tough, 
limited our mistakes, and 
handled it well.” 
It 
almost 
seemed 
like 
Michigan 
embodied 
the 
bishop from Caddyshack in 
that one rainy scene on the 
green (before he got struck by 
lightning). 
After 
the 
thunderstorms 
and 
rain, 
the 
Wolverines 
faced a challenging lineup 
that boasted several top-25 
teams and played up to the 
competition. 
This tournament concluded 
the fall season, so Michigan 
will be not be competing 
again until February. The 
confidence and enthusiasm 
derived from this strong finish 
could certainly bleed into the 

team’s postseason work ethic. 
“We will continue to get 
better through daily effort 
and on a consistent basis,” 
Dowling said. 
On Saturday, using team 
totals of 306 and 293, the 
Wolverines had a 46-hole total 
of 599, which tied them with 
Maryland for fifth-place. 
Freshmen 
Ashley 
Lau 
and 
Sophia 
Trombetta 
led Michigan through the 
Saturday tournament; the two 
tied for ninth with a 147 two-
round total. Lau shot a 71-76, 
and Trombetta shot a 77-70. 
Lau opened her event tying 
her 
career-
low, 
carding 
a 
one-under 
71 in the first 
round, 
while 
Trombetta, 
carding a two-
under 70 in the 
second 
round, 
also 
tied 
her 
career-best 
as well as the 
Wolverines’ 
season-low. 
“Ashely and Sophia had 
awesome rounds,” Dowling 
said. “Having freshmen on the 
leaderboard really shows the 
depth of our team. It also gives 
the team a lot of confidence 
that any of them can be up 
there.”
This type of performance 
continued 
into 
Sunday. 
Michigan, with a final-round 
tally of 297 and season-low 
896 
54-hole 
total, 
closed 
its fall season with a fifth-
place finish. This can be 
credited to Trombetta and 
Lau’s consistent playing. Lau 
led the Wolverines with her 
career-low 221 54-hole total. 
Additionally, she got a career-
best tie for 11th place overall.
“In 
other 
tournaments 
we were not playing up to 
our 
capabilities, 
but 
here 
we competed well in tough 
conditions,” 
Dowling 
said. 
“We showed up and played.”

Freshman Paige Jones emerging as a leader

When 
No. 
3 
Minnesota 
rolled into Crisler Center on 
Saturday night, everyone in 
the arena knew it would be an 
uphill battle. Without starting 
setter Mackenzi Welsh, outside 
hitter 
Sydney 
Wetterstrom, 
middle back Cori Crocker and 
an entirely new formation? An 
even steeper hill to climb.
What the audience might not 
have seen coming, however, 
was freshman Paige Jones’ 
18-kill performance at a .349 
clip 
while 
almost 
single-
handedly winning the first 
set for the No. 12 Michigan 
volleyball team.
With junior outside hitter 
Carly Skjodt playing through 
a sprained ankle after posting 
a 27-kill double-double the 
night before, Jones knew she 
had to step up at the other 
outside hitter position if the 
Wolverines (18-5 overall, 7-5 
Big Ten) were going to have any 

chance at knocking off the Big 
Ten-leading Golden Gophers 
(18-2, 12-0).
“I was ready to embrace (the 
bigger role),” Jones said. “I 
know my teammates trust me, 
and I trust them. So I just go 
(into) every game hoping I can 
do what they need me to do.
“We knew we had to bounce 
back pretty quick 
and prepare for 
this match, and 
before the game, 
(Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen) just 
told us to come 
out and swing at 
the ball. Go for 
every ball. Don’t 
hold 
back 
and 
good things will 
happen.”
With an ailing roster, Rosen 
was impressed with how the 
freshman showed up under the 
lights in front of a large Crisler 
crowd.
 “(Jones) has been working 
really hard to raise her level 

and raise her game,” Rosen 
said. “It’s been tough in this 
conference to play back-to-
back nights and have good 
nights. I thought, you know, 
last night she played great, 
and she came out tonight and 
played great offensively as well 
so that was a big step for her as 
an individual.
“When 
you 
have a change 
or 
somebody 
goes 
down, 
you 
want 
somebody else 
to step up, and 
I thought she 
really stepped 
up tonight and 
did a great job. 
I think it’s a 
good step in 
her 
progression 
and 
that’s 
what we’re looking for, to keep 
getting better every day. And 
I thought (Jones) got better 
today.”
Though the freshman played 
a near-flawless set, one of 

her few mistakes catalyzed a 
Minnesota run that carried 
throughout the rest of the set. 
After dropping two set points, 
the Wolverines were tied at 
25-25 when Jones failed to 
return 
a 
relatively 
routine 
serve, giving Minnesota the 
point it needed to steal the set.
“Personally, 
my 
passing 
wasn’t as good at the end of 
that set,” Jones said. “I could 
have let that ball go out of 
bounds. I could not get aced. 
I mean, there’s just something 
I 
personally 
could 
have 
controlled and that my team 
knows that I can do and I just 
didn’t do it.
“Minnesota’s a good team 
so they’re going to emphasize 
when somebody does that.”
After another stellar outing 
in an otherwise disappointing 
result, Jones hopes to continue 
her 
successful 
freshman 
campaign as Michigan figures 
out a way to get over the hump 
of 
beating 
higher-ranked 
teams.

Stats dive: ‘M’ third-down offense

Last season, the Michigan 
football 
team 
had 
well-
documented 
offensive 
issues: 
quarterback 
injuries, 
inconsistent pass protection 
and play calling that was forced 
to become less complex. You’ve 
heard some version of that 
before.
But lost in the fold, perhaps, 
was 
how 
ineffective 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
on 
third 
down. They moved the chains 
at just a 33-percent rate in 
2017, 
which 
ranked 
112th 
nationally — the worst during 
coach Jim Harbaugh’s tenure. 
That was one of several factors 
that prompted an offseason 
full 
of 
assistant 
coaching 
changes, including the hiring 
of offensive line coach Ed 
Warinner and wide receiver 
coach Jim McElwain, on top 
of the departure of offensive 
coordinator Tim Drevno.
The 
moves 
have 
helped 
Michigan 
transpose 
that 
unseemly third-down statistic. 
The Wolverines are converting 
just over 47 percent of their 
third-down opportunities, up 
97 spots from last season.
“It’s nobody’s fault for what 
happened last year and the last 
couple years,” said fifth-year 
senior defensive end Chase 
Winovich on Monday. “But I’d 
just say in general this year, 
it’s a big relief knowing we can 
actually score touchdowns on 
a pretty consistent basis and 
move the ball and control time 
of possession.”
More of that responsibility 
has 
fallen 
on 
junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson’s 
running 
ability 
in 
recent 
weeks. On a 4th-and-2 during 
the 
Wolverines’ 
eventual 
game-sealing 
drive 
against 
Michigan 
State, 
Patterson 
faked to 245-pound sophomore 
fullback Ben Mason and picked 
up the conversion himself.
Excluding sacks, Patterson 

has 242 yards and a touchdown 
on the ground this season. 
Over 60 percent of that has 
come in his last two games, 
per SB Nation’s Bill Connelly. 
Lopsided scores took the load 
off Patterson early in the 
season, but his scope has been 
widened with more zone read 
and run-pass-option looks.
“(Patterson’s running) opens 
up a lot in the offense — it’s 
something the defense has to 
defend,” Harbaugh said after 
Patterson ran for 113 yards 
against Wisconsin on Oct. 6. 
“I thought he did a heck of a 
job with his fakes, with his 
ball handling, with his running 
ability, all facets.”
Improved run blocking has 
also opened up Michigan’s 
offense. Karan Higdon, despite 
missing 
the 
season’s 
third 
game, has already amassed 831 
yards.
The senior running back’s 
production continues to be the 
backbone of Michigan’s offense. 
20 percent of the Wolverines’ 
third downs come in short-
yardage situations, which ranks 
first nationally. Getting 5.4 
yards-per-carry from Higdon is 
undoubtably pivotal to that.
“Karan deserves a lot of 
credit,” Harbaugh said Monday. 

“He’s gotten tough yards and 
yards after contact and yards 
more than what the play is 
blocked for.”
Hidgon’s efforts appear even 
more critical when you consider 
the flip side of the Wolverines’ 
third-down 
coin. 
Michigan 
has the country’s third-worst 
conversion rate — 14.6 percent 
— when faced with 3rd-and-6 
or longer.
It reveals another linchpin 
to the Wolverines’ offense: 
staying on schedule. By giving 
itself manageable situations on 
third down, Michigan keeps the 
chains moving to wear down 
defenses eventually. It’s second 
to only Texas A&M in time of 
possession among Power Five 
teams.
Perhaps that is not a surprise 
considering Harbaugh’s style. 
His background lies within 
the West Coast offense, which 
is predicated on the short-to-
intermediate 
passing 
game. 
That allows Michigan chances 
to keep the ball and chew the 
clock.
But system aside, a simple 
truth remains: When they work 
themselves into manageable 
third-down 
situations, 
few 
teams are better than the fifth-
ranked Wolverines. 

Penn State next on “Revenge Tour”

Last we saw Chase Winovich, 
he was parading off the field in 
East Lansing, calling Michigan 
State little brother after a win over 
the Spartans.
“On one hand, it’s like I’m 
moving on from it,” the fifth-
year senior defensive end said on 
Monday.
But it’s Chase Winovich, so, 
naturally, there’s another hand.
“But on the other hand, it’s like 
— which, I still am moving on from 
it, distancing myself from it — but 
it’s like, in my eyes, I didn’t start 
the fight. … For them, they called 
us Little Sister in the summer. 
They came there and tried the 
antics with the helmet, you guys 
know how that went. From there, 
they wanted us to take the low 
road, maybe I took the bait. But 
like I said, I don’t mean any harm 
from it. I’m just having fun.” 
Then a pause.
“I’m moving on. I’m focusing on 
Penn State now.”
The bye week has done little to 
quell Winovich’s self-proclaimed 
“revenge tour” or its gregarious 
torch-bearer. 
It’s 
a 
phrase 
Winovich coined in the offseason 
while reflecting on a disappointing 
8-5 season a year ago, one in which 
he felt other teams, “were kind of 
bullying” Michigan. 
It’s undoubtedly about avenging 
losses to Wisconsin, Michigan 
State, 
Penn 
State 
and 
Ohio 
State. But it’s also, more broadly, 
Winovich says, “an attitude.”
“They kind of took advantage of, 
we were kind of in an in-between 
year,” Winovich said. “Something 
about that gave a bad taste in my 
mouth. I knew, me personally, I 
wanted our lunch money back, and 
I wanted them to pay interest.”
Perhaps no one bullied the 2017 
Wolverines team worse than Penn 
State did, marching its way to a 
42-13 win at night in Happy Valley. 
Michigan allowed over 500 total 
yards in the rout.
That demolition started when 
running back Saquon Barkley 

galloped to a 69-yard touchdown 
less than a minute into the game 
and ended with Penn State 
snapping the ball near the goal line 
in an attempt to add yet another 
touchdown to extend the lead 
to 37 points with mere seconds 
remaining.
Players regarded the latter play 
as a slight. This week, Winovich 
and Michigan want that “interest.”
“(That game) lingers with 
us every day,” Winovich said. 
“It lingered with us in winter 
conditioning. Obviously, we don’t 
like what they tried to do at the 
end of the game; they tried to score 
that touchdown again.”
Defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown echoed a similar senitment 
last Monday night on the Inside 
Michigan Football radio show.
“I wake up every morning and 
think about (that game),” Brown 
said. “Honest.”
Added 
Winovich: 
“I’d 
say 
(Brown) is definitely a little bit 
more amped up this week than 
he’s been, and that’s saying 
something.”
But just as this isn’t that 
Michigan team, this season’s 
Nittany Lions team is not the 
same.
The fifth-ranked Wolverines 
opened up in most sportsbooks 
as a double-digit favorite. They 

are riding a seven-game winning 
streak with legitimate College 
Football Playoff aspirations in 
sight. The 14th-ranked Nittany 
Lions have two last-minute losses 
to Ohio State and Michigan State 
and are all but eliminated from 
title talks.
Win Saturday and Michigan 
can start to peer ahead at a 
potential de facto playoff game 
in Columbus in three weeks. It 
would have three of four legs on 
the “revenge tour” checked off.
Lose Saturday and much of that 
flies out of the window. 
“The wins are definitely more 
satisfying,” Winovich said. “Just 
seeing our transition from last 
year’s team to this year’s team, and 
how much growth we’ve had. It’s a 
really cool thing to see.” 
And for Winovich, each passing 
Saturday carries more and more 
meaning. He came back to play 
his fifth season at Michigan to be 
in this very position. It’s all right 
there as he envisioned it.
“For me personally, it’s like I can 
look up and I’ve got eight quarters 
left in the Big House, and my time 
is coming to an end here,” he said. 
“And it’s very special to me to see 
Michigan in a position where, if I 
leave it, and we do big things here 
hopefully, it’s just leaving on a 
great note.”

What we’ve learned about the Michigan men’s basketball team so far

opened parts of three practices 
to the media, and most recently 
opened the last hour of practice 
Monday night to the public. 
Fans were treated to various 
drills, 
a 
30-minute, 
full-
court five-on-five scrimmage 
between Maize and Blue teams 
and a three-point shooting 
contest between sophomores 
Isaiah Livers and Jordan Poole. 
(Poole drained twelve treys in 
a row to cruise to the victory.)
With the obvious caveat 
that the Wolverines have yet 
to play a game, here are five 
observations to draw from 
the last month of availability, 
and 
Monday’s 
practice 
in 
particular:
This is Zavier Simpson’s 
team
He might not be Michigan’s 
best player, and he certainly 
doesn’t have the most pro 
potential on the team. But 
the 
junior 
point 
guard’s 
importance is unmatched.
During five-on-five drills 
after the Wolverines’ media 
day on Oct. 22. Simpson was 
his typical ball-of-fire self, 
constantly barking at players 
after defensive stops and all 
the while leading with his 
signature ferociousness.
While he was much more 
toned down on Monday, his 
influence was still obvious. In 
one sequence, he leapt to snare 
an errant pass with both hands, 
before 
finding 
sophomore 
guard Eli Brooks with a perfect 
outlet pass, leading to a Livers 
alley-oop finish.
Defensive 
intensity 
will 
always be Simpson’s calling 
card, but Michigan’s practices 
have shown a player very much 
in control of the offense, who 
at the same time is aware of his 
limitations.

While 
not 
necessarily 
explosive, Simpson has shown 
a knack for crafty finishing 
— before scrimmage drills at 
the past two open practices, 
he could be seen working on 
unorthodox flip shots from 
almost 
underhand 
angles. 
And 
during 
this 
Monday’s 
scrimmage, he showed the 
physicality necessary to drive 
past freshman guard David 
DeJulius for layups on multiple 
occasions.
Simpson’s main weakness 
— his shooting — didn’t seem 
to impair his unit’s offensive 
production on Monday either, 
as efficient passing, off-ball 
movement and a solid pick-
and-roll 
connection 
with 
junior center Jon Teske made 
up for this deficiency. He’s a 
different kind of floor general 
than Beilein has had in years 
past. That much was clear last 
year, but this year, it’s even 
more apparent how Simpson’s 
molded Michigan’s identity.
Big men will be a focal 

point
The 
aforementioned 
Simpson-Teske 
two-man 
game dominated the Maize 
team’s offensive sets, and if 
Monday was any evidence, 
the Wolverines may rely on 
their big men quite heavily 
for production. 
What 
that 
actually entails, 
though, is still 
up for debate.
Teske 
and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
center 
Austin 
Davis displayed 
solid 
mobility 
after 
setting 
screens 
and 
diving to the basket, and both 
flashed an ability to finish in 
traffic. Neither showed much 
ability to score with their 
backs to the basket, but post-
ups usually are not a large part 
of Beilein’s offenses anyway.
Teske’s improved shooting 
has 
been 
of 
interest 
this 

offseason. 
In 
Monday’s 
scrimmage, he airballed his 
first 
attempt 
from 
three-
point range, but later on, he 
was able to set his feet and 
flush a 17-foot jumper with no 
hesitation. More importantly, 
though, Beilein could be heard 
on 
multiple 
occasions 
yelling 
at 
the 
Maize team to 
set up the pick-
and-pop 
game. 
Even if Teske 
isn’t 
Moritz 
Wagner 
from 
downtown, the 
Wolverines 
clearly 
are 
confident 
that 
they’ll be able to run offense 
through him.
Ignas Brazdeikis will be 
counted on
Brazdeikis started at power 
forward 
during 
Michigan’s 
closed-door 
scrimmage 
at 
Toledo last Saturday, per The 
Athletic’s Brendan Quinn. It’s 

a sign that the Wolverines want 
to get their prized freshman on 
the court in any way they can.
It’s pretty clear why — 
Brazdeikis 
simply 
knows 
how to score. Not only is he 
athletic, skillful and physical, 
but he possesses a relentless 
determination 
to 
attack 
the basket and got to the 
line 
multiple 
times 
during 
Monday’s scrimmage. For a 
Michigan team with a dearth 
of shot-creators, Brazdeikis’ 
aggression will be essential.
However, 
Brazdeikis 
also 
functioned as a ball-stopper, 
and there was generally less 
offensive movement on his Blue 
team with him in the game — 
almost every time Brazdeikis 
got the ball, he put his head 
down and drove straight to the 
basket. In an offensive system 
that relies on constant motion 
and generating open shots, 
Brazdeikis will still have to 
refine his raw scoring ability.
Livers still expanding his 
game

Players and coaches alike 
have wanted the sophomore 
forward to take more offensive 
initiative this season. Monday’s 
scrimmage was encouraging in 
this regard — but it was also a 
reminder that it won’t happen 
overnight.
In one offensive set, Livers 
received the ball alone at the 
top of the key, with Charles 
Matthews just out of position 
to close out. Livers paused for 
a second too long, and ended 
up passing out of the situation, 
prompting Beilein to shout, 
“Shoot that, Isaiah!”
One possession later, Livers 
made up for his indecision. 
Curling to his left, he received 
a pass on the right wing and 
put 
up 
a 
catch-and-shoot 
three without any hesitation, 
catching nothing but net. The 
Wolverines hope he eventually 
won’t need a reminder to do so.
Adrien Nunez might have 
a role
The freshman guard from 
Brooklyn, N.Y., on the other 
hand, doesn’t need to be told 
twice to let it fly, which might 
explain why he started the 
scrimmage for the Maize team 
on Monday.
Nunez 
might 
be 
the 
least-heralded 
member 
of 
Michigan’s freshman class, but 
one could argue he’s already 
the best pure shooter on the 
team. He has a quick, smooth 
release with terrific elevation 
and little excess motion. With 
Duncan Robinson gone to the 
NBA after drilling 237 treys 
over the last three years, 
Nunez is the closest thing the 
Wolverines have to a like-for-
like replacement as a shooter.
Nunez missed all three of 
his 3-point attempts in the 
30-minute 
scrimmage, 
but 
those three attempts were 
diverse — they came from the 
left corner, off a screen and 
four feet behind the arc — and 
displayed what Michigan will 
need from him this season. 
If those shots start to fall, 
Nunez could find himself in an 
integral role sooner than later, 
considering the Wolverines’ 
team composition.

Michigan coach John Beilein could rely heavily on players like Isaiah Livers, Ignas Brazdeikis and even Adrien Nunez to replace lost production from last season.
