"I was actually very surprised.
The first week that I uploaded it, it
was unlisted and that means that
you ... search it in YouTube (and)
you can't find it because it's not
there," Yong said.
Yong said part of the reason he
was surprised at his video's popu-
larity is because he didn't exten-
sively promote the video.
"It was really crazy because
not that much advertising hap-
pened on my part. I posted it on
my blog, but I only have a couple of
friends that follow me," Yong said.
"My dad shared it with a couple of
church friends, but that's about all
the advertising that happened on
our part."
While there are now many sup-
portive and positive comments,
Yong said the first few comments
were negative.
"It was actually kind of scary
because the first two comments
that I got were very discourag-
ing," Yong said. "All of a sudden
this influx of really positive com-
ments came in, and then I got this
one comment saying, 'By the way
your video is flying around Uni-
versity staff,' and Ikind of thought,
'Whoa, that's crazy."'
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, University alum
Craig Gruenberg, choir director
at Granada Hills Charter High
School, said Yong was a partici-
pant in choir and the a cappella
group Smooth White Chocolate.
Gruenberg, who participated in
the Friars a cappella group at the
University when he was a student
in the 1960s, said Smooth White
Chocolate was inspired by the Fri-
ars.
"The University of Michigan is
a school that kids talk to me a lot
about."
Gruenberg said Yong had a
strong desire to go to Michigan
and added that he posted the video
on Facebook to support Yong.
"When he found out that he
said. "Though we have only been
here for two years, panhandlinghas
had a bigger impact on other busi-
nesses."
Engineering sophomore Chelsea
Pugh said she wouldn't give money
to a panhandler on campus because
it is inconvenient to have to take out
money from her purse when she's
rushing to class.
"I would donate money to
charities and social welfare orga-
nizations instead," Pugh said. "(Stu-
dents) are definitely being more
intentional when (they) donate to a
charity." r

was on the waitlist he (made
the video)," Gruenberg said. "I
responded to the video and said,
'Hey Michigan, get this guy into
the college therebecause he's a
great guy.'"
Gruenberg said he saw a lot of
other people from their commu-
nity support Yong's video online.
"Everyone was cheering (Yong)
on," he said.
Gruenberg also said he thinks
the University is a perfect fit
for Yong and added that Yong
deserves to receive some credit for
taking initiative.
"He used social media in a very
creative way to help make it hap-
pen," Gruenbergsaid.
In an e-mail to the Daily, Uni-
versity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said the University has a holistic
approach to admissions and that
creative expressions like Yong's
don't hurt.
"U-M offers admission to stu-
dents based on academic excel-
lence, their potential to succeed at
U-M and their abilityto contribute
to the university community dur-
ing their time here," Fitzgerald
wrote.
Fitzgerald said before Yong
even made the video, he was obvi-
ously of an appropriate academic
caliber to make the waitlist.
"With this particular student,
it's worth noting, of course, that he
met U-M admission requirements
or he would not have been offered
a spot on the waitlist," Fitzgerald
wrote.
Fitzgerald explained that while
reaching out to admissions in ways
like Yong did doesn't necessarily
factor into an admissions decision,
it is still encouraged.
"We always welcome expres-
sions of intent to enroll - by
video or other means - but these
expressions are not something
that would determine whether
someone was offered admission,"
Fitzgerald wrote.

"We heard the panhandlers were
in it for money," Briere said. "They
weren't in it to raise money to pay
rent or for food. They weren't in it
because they had no other options.
They saw it as a job."
Briere said she thinks panhan-
dlers wouldn't target the Ann Arbor
area if citizens and students weren't
so generous.
"If you are not willing to say no

to a panhandler, then they would
still be in Ann Arbor and on cam-
pus," Briere said. "We've heard
from one panhandler that he would
ask for a quarter and receive 20
dollars from someone on their way
to a bar."
Eric Schreffler - lead sales asso-

he will definitely support the may-

MEN'S ROWING
Former Wolverine rower headed to Summer Olympics

Monday, June 18, 2012
The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
Usually, athletes train all their
life to go to the Olympics.
But Tom Peszek has only been
training eight years, and he's head-
ed to London this summer. With a
partner he's only been competing
with for a few months.
The former Michigan rower and
his partner, Silas Stafford, recently
won the men's pair event in West
Windsor, N.J. to qualify for the 2012
Summer Games.
"It's awesome, it's quite a thrill,"
Peszek said.
After starting out in second
place after a quick jump off the line,
Peszek and Stafford fought off a
tough headwind to take the lead.
"It was a pretty good race - it

was long," Peszek said. "We had a
strong headwind, so it was one of
the longest races I've ever had.
."(But) it was relatively simple,
we just went out, got up early, and
stayed ahead."
Peszek and Stafford beat out a few
other boats for the victory, which
clinched a spot on the national team
to represent the United States in
London in a couple'of months - but
their win didn't come that easy.
Peszek originally tried out for
national team's eight-man crew, but
things didn't work out in his favor.
That's how he and Stafford decided
to become partners.
"We were both the last guys not
selected, so pretty much right after
that, we went to the pair and picked
up right from there," Peszek said.
"Silas and I started rowing as a pair

a few months ago, but we've known
each other since 2007. We were on
the under-23 U.S. National Team, so
we go way back, but this is the first
time we've raced as a pair."
New things don't seem to be a
problem for Peszek, though - he
just started rowing when he came
to Michigan, after deciding to join
a club sports team to keep in shape.
He wasn't even sure that rowing
was a serious sport until he joined
the Wolverines' club team.
"It kinda just slowly took over my
life, in a good way," Peszek said. "I
really had no idea what I was get-
ting myself into."
Despite the club sport status
of the men's rowing team - the
women's squad is a varsity sport at
Michigan - they still take racing
very seriously.

During his time at Michigan,
Peszek mentioned that beating Wis-
consin and Cornell, two of the big-
ger varsity programs, were some of
the greatest moments of his career
at Michigan. He also said that the
squad competes against anybody
and everybody, from top varsity
teams to other club squads.
"It's run by the students, (so) you
have to pay dues and do all sorts of
fundraisers to keep the club alive
and kicking, but at the same time
we'll race anybody," Peszek said.
"We'll race better varsity programs,
other club programs - it doesn't
really matter. And I've always loved
the fact that being a club program
was never an excuse. We've never
walked away from anything."
That mentality has surely helped
Peszek get to where he is today. He

noted that all of his coaches have
helped him become a better rower
- especially his current coach, a
former Olympian.
"I'm fortunate enough to be
coached right now by Bryan Vol-
penhein, who won the Olympics
back in 2004 (and) set the world
record in the process," Peszek said.
"He knows what he's doing and he's
been a big help."
Does Peszek think being coached
by a former gold medalist comes
with high expectations?
"(Silas and I) don't really have
much for expectations," he said.
"We feel like we can go out and beat
anybody, just about. We're look-
ing forward to it because we don't
know how we're going to stack up,
so we're really excited to see what
we can get."

to The Michigan Daily that the
Sherriff's department "will begin

meaning the residents may have

Alonzo Young, the first gradu-
ate of Camp Take Notice, heard of
the camp through word of mouth
and pursued his associate's
degree at Washtenaw Communi-
ty College during his stay. Young
referred to the camp as a "family."
Anthony Ramirez, a Camp
Take Notice resident, said he
went down to the camp because
he could not stay at a shelter due
to not being a resident of Washt-
enaw County.
Ramirez expressed the same
"family" mentality as Young, say-
ing the camp provided him with
heaters, blankets and safety.
"Everybody looks after every-
body," he said.

MARATHON

national companies like Macy's.
Currently, the marathon's web-
site has released times for 580 peo-
ple in the full marathon and 1,211
people in the half marathon. Run-
ning store chain Running Fit pro-
vided timing services for the event.
Finishing first in the marathon
was 39-year-old Marco Capelli with
a time of 2:48:02. The first woman
to finish was 24-year-old Allyson
Weimer, who had a time of 3:11:36.
In the half marathon, 20-year-old
Toledo native Trevin Flickinger
finished first with a time of 1:18:40.
29-year-old Denver native Sarah
Pizzo was the first female to finish
with a time of 1:27:10.
Among the marathon's organiz-
ers were Michael Highfield, found-
er of Champions for Charity, and his
wife Andrea Highfield.
In an interview after the mara-
thon started, Andrea Highfield
said she was thankful for the gentle
weather, adding that she and her
husband had been concerned the
morning would be ruined with rain
and storms.
The night before the race, the
website for the marathon noted that
there was a planned procedure of
postponing the race or pausing the
race's timing if lightning was spot-
ted before or during the race.
"So thankful," Highfield said.
"We were both up all night just
making arrangements for if we had
to switch times."
Water stations were set up at
every mile, and stations providing
GU energy gel were set up at miles
12,18 and 22.5.
At the beginning of the mara-
thon, Highfield told runners they.
could to vote for the best, most
enthusiastic water station when
they finished the race. Highfield
explained the best-voted station
would receive prizes such as a Veri-
zon tablet and $250 in cash.
Highfield added that volunteers
came from places including Ann
Arbor Public Schools.
Highfield also said her husband's
committee, the Ann Arbor Mara-
thon Committee, had researched
the best course for Ann Arbor.
"My husband and his commit-
tee wanted to show off all of Ann
Arbor," Highfield said.
Though the inaugural marathon
started outside Michigan Stadium,
Highfield said future events could
try finishing there.
"It would be nice to be able to
finish (in the Big House) - and
maybe we'll get to that someday,"

Highfield said.
Standing on the corner of East
Madison and State streets, North-
ville resident Sarah Hendricks
waited to cheer on Rackham stu-
dent Clarissa Freeman, who ran the
half marathon after suffering from
prolonged paralysis due to a debili-
tating condition called spina bifida
while in high school.
"She has a medical condition,
and she had a relapse and wasn't
able to walk or take care of herself,"
Hendricks said. "She's been work-
ing really hard and training, so it's
pretty much a miracle."
Hendricks explained Free-
man's relapse occurred 18 months
before the marathon and while her
time was well done for a first-time
runner, she knows Freeman can
improve.
"For a (first) race, there's always a
learning curve for both participants
and the organizers, so you (can)
always learn," Hendricks said.
Before the marathon, supporters
of an Immaculate Heart of Mary
Catholic nun named Julia, who was
running the full marathon, stood by
the starting line.
Maxine Kollasch, an IHM sister
from Monroe, said Julia was run-
ning the event to fundraise for their
faith and spirituality outreach blog
called A Nun's Life Ministry.
"We have Julia running the mar-
athon," Kollasch said. "She's been
training faithfully, and she's really
excited about this."
She added that they were happy
to provide Julia with a much-need-
ed energy boost of coffee after she
completed the marathon.
Team Red, White & Blue, an Ann
Arbor-based nonprofit group for
wounded veterans, had members
running in the full marathon, half
marathon and SK, including John-
ny Algor, a recent law and business
graduate and military veteran.
Before he ran the 5K, Algor said
his foundation fundraised in sup-
port of the event, which he added is
one of many events his organization
participates in to promote wounded
veterans' well-being.
"We try to reintegrate wounded
.veterans back into society, and one
of the ways we try to get them out
is through physical fitness," Algor
said. "That's also how we build
awareness."
Algor said his organization was
able to come together and bond
with a dinner at Conor O'Neill's
the night before as well as a tailgate
planned for after the event.
Algor said he was excited to run
by the places where he studied for
years.
"We'll get to see some of the

sights, I'm excited for it," Algor said.
Ann Arbor residents Christopher
and Carolyn Todd sat in chairs on
the corner of Hill and State streets
to cheer on their son Kevin and
friend Josh, who traveled from
their respective homes in Boston
and Miami to run.
Carolyn Todd said the marathon
did not count as a qualifier for the
esteemed Boston Marathon, some-
thing she said would have drawn in
more competitive runners.
"This is not a qualifying event,
which is not disappointing, but that
means it's not (the) highest caliber
- but it's their first (marathon),"
Todd said.
The Todds said it was nice that
the event was in their hometown
because this was their first time
getting to see their son run a mara-
thon, even though he has run many
and qualified for the Boston Mara-
thon this year.
Christopher Todd said if they
had a gripe about the marathon, it
would be at their struggle to find
parking.
"We were planning on parking at
Yost, but there's no way of getting in
there," Todd said.
Carolyn Todd said the marathon
turned out great, but added that she
presumed drivers were probably a
little irked about the closed streets.
"Locals are not happy about the
traffic situation," she said.
Kinesiology senior Ian Prochas-
ka and his twin brother Zachary
tied as winners of the 5K, both run-
ning times of 16:59.
Prochaska said he found the
course easy to follow.
"There were maps online, so
those were nice, so I had a little
bit of a look (at) the course before
I showed up, and then since my
brother and I were out front, there
was a lead vehicle," he said. "So I
just followed (the vehicle) the entire
race and that was wonderful."
Prochaska said the scheduling of
their final exam in their springclass
the next day deterred them from
running one of the longer courses
and led them to compete in the 5K.
"My brother and I actually
planned on doing the half mara-
thon, but since we have our bio-
chem final tomorrow, we wanted
to be off our feet for the rest of the
day," he said.
Prochaska said he was happy
that the marathon benefited a good
cause.
"Any time you get to support
things like the Ann Arbor school
system, that's always a wwonderful
thing," he said. "Getting out there
and competing with a bunch of peo-
ple is just an added bonus."

Person previously
noticed in other
cities in southeast
Michigan
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
ManagingEditor
According to a security bulle-
tin issued by the Department of
Public Safety, a man - who has
repeatedly been seen in southeast
Michigan - approached a group of
14-year-old girls on the north side
of the Diag, calling them "beauti-
ful," at about 6:05 p.m. Thursday.
The 69-year-old man, whose
address is in Wisconsin, eventu-
ally asked them if they would like
to leave with him.
The bulletin notes that it has
been issued for "awareness pur-
poses only" and though no crimi-
nal charges have been issued
against the man, the bulletin
identified the man's behavior as
"concerning."
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said the man had been seen
in Chesterfield Township near
Lake St. Clair, which is more than
an hour's drive east of Ann Arbor.
"There had been a report the
previous day out of Chesterfield
Township that they were looking
for a man matching this descrip-
tion," she said.
According to a press release
issued by the Chesterfield Police
Department, the man drove up to
two boys - only 9 and 11 years old
- the night of June 13. He report-
edly asked one child his gender.
Also according to the report, an
adult approached the vehicle and
asked the man a question, but he
drove away before answering.
Both Chesterfield's Police

Department and the Ann Arbor
Police Department describe the
man's vehicle as a black Ford
Explorer with a Wisconsin license
plate. However, the AAPD identi-
fies the vehicle as a 2004 model
while the CPD identifies it as a
2008-2010 model.
Ann Arbor's report goes on to
describe the man as 5'8" and 220
pounds with a gray beard.
Brown said she has not heard of
any charges filed against the man,
despite his peculiar actions.
"None of the police depart-
ments, at least that I'm aware of,
have reports of anything that con-
stitutes a crime - just very dis-
turbing behavior," Brown said.
To avoid situations like Thurs-
day's incident, Brown recom-
mended residents not walk alone
or speak to strangers, adding they
should call the police if a stranger
approaches or "if you feel like
there is somethingnot quite right."
LSA junior Omar Hadied said
he hadn't heard of this particular
incident and he feels it's impor-
tant that DPS use crime alerts to
keep students informed of poten-
tial dangers on campus, like the
man with the van.
"I do see the crime alerts that
are sent out," Hadied said. "I
think those are really important
just to keep students aware of
what's going on."
While the incident occurred
in the early evening, Hadied said
that staying with multiple people
is a common-sense measure to
avoid crime, especially after dark.
"I think one very good tip ... is
to go out in groups at night - don't
be alone," Hadied said. "Even
though those fourteen-year-old
girls were in a group, I still think
that it's important to go (out with)
a group and not keep yourself vul-
nerable at night."

he results of this November's election will have a major impact on
numerous policy decisions at the local, state and federal level. But
a new set of laws passed by the Michigan House of Representa-
tives threatens to deny voters the opportunity to express their views at
the voting booth. The House bills are clearly deliberate attempts to pro-
hibit many Michigan citizens from voting, including college students and
minority groups. In such a pivotal election year, Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder must veto these bills so everyone's voices can be heard without
unfair and unnecessary restrictions.

New album climaxes
into Usher-uncharted
territory
ByKAYLA UPADHYAYA
SeniorArts Editor
The release of pop-soul phenom
Usher's newest album comes at
a time when pop music is largely
struggling to hold
on to any sense *
of craftsmanship
and genuine- Looking 4
ness. And with f
his last album,
Raymond v. Ray- Usher
mond, Usher
wholly bought RCA
into these fads,
releasing some of his most trite and
unimpressive singles. With Looking
4 Myself he transforms the trends,

bends and twists them to make
them his own. And the end product
is nothingshort of masterful.
But Usher isn't really looking for
himself - he knows who he is and
that's why he's a lasting megastar in
a genre where so many have their
brief, fiery moment in the spotlight
before flickering and fading. His
music has always been honest, and
Looking 4 Myself is no exception. In
fact, it's his most emotionally lay-
ered album since the sensational
Confessions.
But the album is not without its
missteps, and Usher still throws
on a few auto-tuned, Top-40-
esque tracks to guarantee radio
playability. The album's first two
tracks, "Can't Stop Won't Stop" and
"Scream," make absolutely no pre-
tensions, the former opening oh-so-
daftly with "Hey, what's up, this is
a jam / Turn it up," and the latter
featuring a too-familiar beat. When


will Usher learn that a song with-
out his sweet, lilting falsetto is like
a sugarless cake? The bonus tracks
similarly lack musical or emotional
depth: The intriguing classical vio-
lin sampling in "I.F.U" is overshad-
owed by forced "Birthday Cake"-y
robo-claps.
The supporting cast Usher
employs speaks to the eccentric-
ity of influences at play on Looking
4 Myself In "Twisted," he teams
up with The Neptunes to create
a stripped-down funk jam that
blends a throwback, swinging beat
with early '00s soul, similar to the
likes of Gnarls Barkley. To create
an instant pop-house dance hit, he
turns to Swedish House Mafia and
their crisp, layered synth sounds.
Perhaps most bizarrely is his part-
nership with Empire of the Sun's
Luke Steele on the smooth titular
track, "Looking 4 Myself," that
spectacularly imbues Usher's soul

sounds with a bouncing, electro-
rock guitar line.
Alive and effortless, the lead sin-
gle, "Climax," remains the albums
most skillful endeavor. The Dip-
lo-helmed power-ballad features
delicate, ever-crescendoing synths
sprinkled amongst a brew of per-
fectly timed percussive sounds.
Usher's vocals are huge and vulner-
able all at once, as he wails around
a trilling string arrangement from
composer Nico Muhly. It might just
be one of the best breakup songs of
all time.
Usher similarly shows off his
pipes on "Dive," a lulling and under-
stated anthem that reaches Marvin
Gaye levels of vocal variation. And
there's "I Care For U," which opens
with a warbling bass and hollow
percussion suggesting another
lackluster club banger. But the song
unfolds into a beautiful electro-soul
slow jam with verses reminiscent of

Prince.
Usher calls the genre of Look-
ing 4 Myself "revolutionary pop"
and considering the way the album
culminates so many influences into
a cohesive sound that highlights
the multi-platinum, multi-Gram-
my-winning artist's finest skills,
he might just earn such an enter-
prising claim. The album has the
crossover and sex appeal of Justin
Timberlake's FutureSex/Love-
Sounds, but whereas J.T. focused a
bit too much on bending the genre,
leaving the lyrics underthought
and gooey, Usher experiments and
still maintains an endearing level
of sincerity with his verses. He
doesn't redefine himself, because
he doesn't need to. Instead, he sug-
gests that big-pop doesn't necessar-
ily need to follow the crass Top-40
template and the genre isn't com-
pletely isolated from musical and
emotional breadth.

Mediocre variation of Rock' musical

If Gov. Snyder signs the eight-
bill House package, Michigan
voters would have to "present
photo identification when apply-
ing for an absentee ballot in their
first election or sign an affidavit,"
the Associated Press reports. The
House bills would also require
third-party voter registration
groups - including registration
groups affiliated with universi-
ties - to "register and receive
training." House Republicans
argue that these bills would
make voting more secure in the
state of Michigan.
Under the Higher Education
Act, universities have a legal
obligation to help their students
register to vote. For example, the
Voice Your Vote group here at the
University works to "encourag(e)
student voter participation"
under a "non-partisan" label.
Many University students will
be voting for the first time this
fall, and some won't know the
proper registration process or
other voting logistics. The House

bills would make these groups
receive training from Michi-
gan's Secretary of State as well
as submit completed voter reg-
istration forms within two busi-
ness days in the last week of the
voter registration period, which
would greatly hinder the ability
for third-party voter registration
groups to help students with the
voting process.
The bills also are very likely to
be politically motivated. College
students and minority groups
usually vote for Democrats in
elections, so the Republican-led
House would naturally want to
reduce the number of potential
Democratic votes in a close elec-
tion. This tactic is unacceptable
since the right to vote is undeni-
ably guaranteed by the Consti-
tution. House Republicans also
claim that 1,000 dead people
voted in Michigan between 2008
and 2011. This is a false notion,
as they were "clerical errors,"
according to Michigan's Secre-
tary of State Office. It's clear that

voter fraud is not the problem
here, and Republicans are grasp-
ing at straws to-try to determine
who votes and who doesn't.
There is no reason the gov-
ernment should be intervening
to further diminish voter turn-
out as only 40 to 60 percent of
American citizens vote in nation-
al elections. Strict voter ID laws
shouldn't be established to turn
even more Americans away from
the polls each year. Instead, the
government should be working to
increase voter turnout, so that as
many American citizens as pos-
sible can vote and become part of
our nation's future.
Gov. Snyder needs to veto this
unjust bill in order to ensure that
as all Michigan citizens over
18 have the ability to vote come
November and have an impor-
tant say in our nation's future.
Moreover, the governor's veto is
imperative, as it could potentially
deter many minorities and col-
lege students from voting in the
future.

"The fact is that the system is
broken. I predict to you there will
be scandals," Sen. John McCain
lamented on CNN this month
when asked about the current state
of campaign finance.
Sen. McCain was referring to a
2010 Supreme Court Decision in
which Citizens United sued the
U.S. government for not allowing
them to run an anti-Hillary Clin-
ton ad during the democratic pri-
mary, arguing that the restriction
violated their freedom of speech as
a corporation. The Supreme Court,
in a monumental decision, over-
turned the law, allowing unlim-
ited influence by corporations and
unions in national elections for the
first time since 1947.
Chief Justice John Roberts,
writing the opinion of the court,
argued that corporations have the
same protection of free speech
under the First Amendment as
individuals, so their influence on
campaigns should be limitless.
Justice John Paul Stevens,
however, adamantly objected to
the court's decision, arguing that
wealthy Americans will essentially
have more political influence than
poor and middle-class Americans
who can't afford to make political
donations. Unfortunately, Justice
Stevens was right, and the disas-
trous effects of the court's ruling
are emergingas the election season
heats up.
Ultra-rich Americans now
donate millions to what are known
as Super PACs, political action
committees that typically run
attack campaigns on behalf of their
preferred candidate. Super PACs
drown out the voices of those who
do not have the luxury to spend
millions of dollars on political
campaigns.
For example, Sheldon Adel-
son, a casino owner in Las Vegas,
just donated $10 million to a Mitt
Romney Super PAC. In a Forbes
magazine interview, he said his
political donations could be "limit-
less" to prevent President Obama's
"socialization" of America. Adel-

son is worth an estimated $20 to
$25 billion and could finance Mitt
Romney's presidential campaign
single-handedly if he so chooses.
Adelson acknowledges that his
personal wealth gives him greater
political influence than others.
"I'm against very wealthy people
attempting to or influencing elec-
tions," Adelson explained. "But as
long as it's doable I'm going to do
it. Because I know that guys like
Soros have been doing it for years,
if not decades. And they stay below
the radar by creating a network
of corporations to funnel their
money. I have my own philosophy
and I'm not ashamed of it." Adelson
justifies his donations by the exam-
ple of George Soros, a left-leaning
activist who has funded Democrat-
ic campaigns for years. This allows
for continuous funding, as blame is
always placed on others.
Consequently, even when
wealthy Americans are aware that
they're literally buying extra polit-
ical influence, they continue to do
it anyway since that's simply how
politics is played these days.
The issue of wealthy Americans
buying political influence will
only worsen as our government
expands and has a greater influ-
ence in daily life. In the past five
years, the government has expand-
ed its influence by deciding which
startup companies receive loans
and which banks receive $1 billion
in bailout money. Corporations not
only have an ideological stake in
election results, but they increas-
ingly have financial stakes as well.
The new ruling thus far has
helped the Republican party more
than Democrats. But the Citizens
United decision has the potential
to be disastrous for the future of
free elections in the U.S. While
there ought to be concern for keep-
ing free speech in elections, ulti-
mately the lower- and middle-class
political opinions must be protect-
ed from those with the money to
buy influence.

A threesome is not out of the question.
times more exciting without the
love-sick puppy dog auras hang-
ing over their heads every waking
moment. The premiere has their
new bromance fully on display,
with Moyer and Skarsgard each
complementing the other to per-
fection. They never needed Sookie
anyway.
Moving on to Sookie: she
really is the worst character in
the premiere, and, undoubtedly,
the entire series. Her self-cen-
teredness knows no bounds and
her calm demeanor while clean-
ing tattered bits of Debbie's (Brit
Morgan) blown-off head from
the kitchen floor just comes off
way creepier than was probably
intended. At least there aren't any
pining lovers hanging around,
besides poor Alcide (Joe Mangan-
iello), who's truly having some bad
luck in the romance department
lately.
Besides Sookie and Lafayette's
(Nelsan Ellis) poorly played grief
(did we really need the scene of
Lafayette lying in the tub star-
ing at the razor while the sad
music mourns heavily in the
background?), the rest of the pre-
miere promises plenty of twisty
plots to keep the next 11 episodes
juicy. Especially compelling is
the imminent return of suppos-
edly dead, badass ex-Vampire-
King Russell Edgington (Denis
O'Hare), who breathed new life

- so to speak - into season three
and is the best villain the series has
conjured up so far.
What's more, we finally come
close to the illustrious vampire
"Authority," a constant teaser pres-
ence.in previous seasons. At the
same time, we meet Eric's sister,
allowing "True Blood" to violate
yet another social dictate. But the
incestuous sex comes off asa cheap
rip-off of HBO's golden child,
"Game of Thrones," rather than a
shocking moment. The series has
to work a lot harder than that to
shock it's audience with mere sex.
Though the premiere did have its
upsides - not the least of which is a
newly gay, newly fanged Rev. Steve
Newlin (Michael McMillian) and
Pam (Kristin Bauer van Straten) in
a sweat suit - there are still way too
many plot lines to make sense of.
And why does "True Blood" feel the
need to constantly pull in a bunch
of unnecessary new characters,
who don't matter and no one cares
about? We're looking at you Terry
(Todd Lowe) and all the brouhaha
with your former Marine buddy
(Scott Foley) about the weird and
pointless fires.
But truly, the worst moment of
the premiere has to be when Tara
awakens as a vampire. "True Blood"
just can't find the courage to kill off
any big characters, which is unfor-
tunate as there are way too many to
begin with. And Tara has been use-

less for a while now. What a perfect
way to rid the show of yet another
boring loose end. Instead, now we
have to deal with Tara's whole baby
vamp drama, when we've already
gone through that mess with Jes-
sica (Deborah Ann Woll) ages ago.
"True Blood" really needs to stop
taking itself so seriously. It's at it's
best when the quips are flying and
the cheese factor is high, as long as
the series remains self-aware. The
premiere makes the mistake of fall-
ing into soap opera territory, with-
out having any fun along the way.
Still, the show somehow manages
to be as addictive as V and equally
unpredictable. It has its faults, but
none so great as to make us tear our
eyes away from the screen and, god
forbid, miss whathappens next.

Some pundits are calling this November's presi-
dential election one of the most important in recent
history, a showdown that will determine the direc-
tion of our country. They're right - there hasn't been
a greater debate over America's political ideology in
more than three decades, when Ronald Reagan took
office and changed the face of conservatism, the
Republican Party and America. With the soul of our
country atstake this November, voting - and for that
matter, illegal voting - is as important an issue as
ever. However, a chink in the armor of our democ-
racy still lurks: voter fraud laws.
Voter fraud is a huge problem inAmerica. In 2000,
the Gore campaign was accused of racking up thou-
sands of votes from dead people. And currently, non-
citizens are voting in threatening numbers, while
other individuals are voting twice. Any American in
favor of the principles of our democracy should see
these issues as a great threat to the makeup of our
government. But - and yes, there is always a but -
there's just one problem: voter fraud is nothing more
than a red herring to promote laws that will discour-
age and deny legal voters.
Though these laws may seem nonthreatening at
first, they are far from it. They range from simply
requiring a photo ID for voting to complex systems
that confuse and push people away from register-
ing, especially in low-income and minority areas.
Requiring a voter to have an ID may seem innocent,
but according to New York University's School of
Law Brennan Center for Justice, some one in 10 vot-
ers possess no photo ID. Getting a driver's license is
a simple task for some of us, especially those with
access to cars, but low-income people without vehi-
cles or reliable public transportation have a more dif-
ficult time.
Obtaining a photo ID can be especially difficult,
and in some states impossible, if one does not have
a copy of their birth certificate, an issue faced by
many older African-Americans. In fact, a 93-year-
old woman has brought suit against Pennsylvania for
its new voter laws, as she does not possess a driver's
license or a birth certificate. According to the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities, requiring a passport
or birth certificate to get an ID to vote would mean
that almost one in every 11black adults would be dis-

qualified from voting. In Florida, anti-voter fraud
acts have predominantly targeted the Latino com-
munity, as dozens of letters have been sent to eligible
citizens telling them they can't vote.
Further- measures influencing the process of
voter registration greatly affect minorities living in
poorer areas, where voter registration groups can
have a huge impact. In Florida and Michigan, legisla-
tion has passed putting unnecessary restrictions on
such groups while creating short windows of time
between when a voter can fill out his or her registra-
tion and when it can legally be turned in. In Florida,
the time is set at 48 hours and in Michigan at only 24
hours. These restrictions are hurting organizations
trying to register citizens to vote, creating major
roadblocks and little time to navigate through them.
There are plenty of other laws on the books in
Iowa, Texas, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Kansas and
South Carolina - all of which are quite alike and
defended in very similar ways. Voter fraud, for the
most part, is not what people say it is. When fraud
does occur, it happens at rates of about a hundred-
millionth of a percent, as in 20 to 100 people will
actually have illegally voted. On the other hand,
voting will become "significantly harder" for some
5 million eligible voters. In Florida in 2000, some
20,000 people were barred from voting due to
errors in voter restriction systems. Pair these issues
with traditionally poor voter turnout, and the result
is an ineffective law discouraging an already apa-
thetic electorate.
Regardless of whether this is a partisan plot to dis-
courage traditionally Democratic voters from vot-
ing in the upcoming election, or just another poorly
developed anti-fraud policy, these laws are unac-
ceptable. It shouldn't matter whether or not liberals
or conservatives will benefit - what should matter
is that the country formerly known as the "arsenal
of democracy" is subverting the very philosophy we
champion. If we want to end voter fraud, there are
ways to do so. But those ways should not prevent
thousands of eligible citizens from participating in
our country's greatest tradition.

concerned about my vagina.
But no-means no'

of Representatives, according to the Detroit Free Press. She was banned the
next day from speaking in the House.

"People will see a lot of fami-
lies and a lot of curious festival
goers coming up for (the troupe),"
Woulfe added.
But for many, the live music
defines their Top of the Park expe-
rience.
"I love that element of sur-
prise," Woulfe said. "You could
be stumbling across the festival
and all of the sudden you have this
great band from the other side of
the world, or you could stumble on
the festival, and it's a local street
musician."
One rock band hails all the way
from Pakistan: Noori. Sponsored
by the U.S. State Department for
their very first tour of the United
States, the members aim to pro-
mote cultural diplomacy through
their original yet communicable
Pakistani sound.
"Sometimes even within the
same night, you'll have a variety
of music genres playing," Woulfe
said. "I think that's the texture of
a festival, that's what gives it its
quirky personality."
There are 60 performers over
the course of Top of the Park,
including Bearfoot, The Infamous
Stringdusters, Los Gatos, Charlie
Slick and Jennie DeVoe.
The Mainstage events are the

indoor component to the festival,
mainly showing at Power Cen-
ter. While tickets are not free,
they're an investment to experi-
ence performers such as Rufus
Wainwright, Esperanza Spalding,
Pilobolus and Cinematic Titanic,
among others. Al Green opens the
series with his performance this
weekend.
Even with all of the exciting
acts coming up for Top of the Park,
Woulfe still cherishes the outdoor
cinema series. These movies, cho-
sen by the community last fall,
will play outdoors at Ingalls Mall.
"Yeah, you're there to watch the
movie, but you're really there to
hang with your community ... and
it ends up being sometimes a big-
ger social experience than it does
a movie-going experience," Woulfe
explained. "But I think those are
defining moments in peoples' lives
within this festival. We're thrilled
to be a part of that, if we can help
make those kinds of memories."
This year Top of the Park will
feature the films "Ghostbusters,"
"Forrest Gump," "Breakfast at
Tiffany's," "The Big Lebowski,"
"Jurassic Park" and "Dirty Danc-
ing" among others.

events at Top of the Park, please

Nearly five and a half years after
its first release, the seventh game
and prequel to the "Ys" series saw
its North Ameri-
can release via *
the Steam digi-
tal distribution Y .O.i
platform. With Ys
five difficulties Nihon Falcom
ranging from
"Very Easy" to PC
"Nightmare,"
three playable characters, a
20-plus hour main story and two
bonus modes, "Origin" delivers
intense, dynamic combat and high
replay value.
The expansive "Ys" series uni-
verse's beginnings are explained
in "Origin," which covers the jour-
neys of one of three main charac-
ters - Axe-wielding apprentice
knight Yunica, the magician Hugo
and the mysterious and agile Claw
- through 25 floors of a demon-
infested tower. Yunica and compa-
ny hail from Ys, an idyllic floating
sanctuary that is home to a pair of
twin goddesses, Reah and Feena
and the root of all magic, the Black
Pearl. Ys hovers above a ruined
and war-torn landscape fraught
with danger and demons, which
the goddesses have seen fit to dis-
appear to, taking the Black Pearl
with them.
This is where the player char-
acter comes in, hacking, slashing
and blasting their way through the
tower and uncovering the reality
behind the goddesses' disappear-
ance. Each character has a dif-
ferent story, and mastering each
one's abilities is key to fully clear-
ing and understanding "Origin" 's
plot. Serious gamers can even take
a stab at timed and arena modes,
with times and achievements dis-
played in leaderboards worldwide.
The combat is incredibly fast-
paced even on lower levels of dif-
ficulty, and each character has
a vastly different playstyle from
the others. Progressing means
adapting to various platformer
and puzzle-solving elements and
dealing with the various obstacles
enemies impose, from lighting up
your screen with dozens of light-
ning bolts to teleporting and spew-

ing acid. Bosses require inventive
strategies to take down and, while
they border on frustrating, pro-
vide fun and white-knuckled, no-
frill, no-break tests of skill.
As much of "Origin" 's appeal
can be placed into its crazy combat
as can be placed into its environ-
ment; stages are designed to test
out-of-the-boxthinkingand speed,
the synth-heavy, rock-orchestra
soundtrack keeps engagements
lively and the big-eyed Japanese
art style is a welcome break from
the recent string of dark releases.
Fans of other Japanese RPGs like
the "Star Ocean" series or ear-
lier "Final Fantasy" series will
feel at home with the anime-style
cutscenes, wailing synth riffs and
the heavy grind necessary to take
down later bosses.
Hack and slash
to a new level.
Occasionally, players will
encounter a wall in their prog-
ress. This is especially true in
the harder difficulties. In a fash-
ion typical of the "Ys" series and
other RPGs, a startling difficulty
jump separates certain areas
which forces players to go back
and grind for experience and
upgrades. Fortunately, "Origin"
features stacking experience,
defense and strength bonuses for -
individuals engaged in extended
combat, which not only encour-
ages but rewards this kind of
play.
"Ys Origin" is a great game
for anyone looking for fast-
paced action, and with roughly
60 hours necessary just to fully
uncover the plot, five difficulties
to conquer and an Arena. mode
that provides nigh-limitless new
tests of skill, it has a very large
amount of content to explore
and master. Devotees of the
series will find their sanctuary
in this prequel, and newcomers
will have a taste of the signature
balls-to-the-wall combat, puz-
zling platformer characteristics
and adorable character cast the
"Ys" series is famed for.
