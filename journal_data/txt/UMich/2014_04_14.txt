Task force team to
meet with federal
investigators on
Wednesday
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily News Editor
Two months after its formation,
a special Central Student
Government task force has issued
its findings and recommendations
in regards to the University's
handling of former Michigan
football kicker Brendan Gibbons'
sexual misconduct case.
Led by CSG Vice President
Bobby Dishell, a Public Policy
junior and CSG president-elect, the
task force investigatedthe Office of
Student Conflict Resolution's han-
dling of the case. OSCR is respon-
sible for facilitating disciplinary
proceedings against students.
Shortly after The Michigan
Daily reported the permanent sep-
aration of Gibbons from the Uni-
versity, CSG formed a task force to

examine the University's relatively
new Student Sexual Misconduct
Policy and review its handling of
the Gibbons case. According to
documents reviewed by the Daily,
the violation of the Student Sex-
ual Misconduct Policy stemmed
from an incident reported to have
occurred Nov. 22, 2009.
Dishell said the task force will
meet Wednesday with the Depart-
ment of Education Office of Civil
Rights officials conducting the
federal investigation to discuss its
findings. He said the investigators
requested a meeting in late March.
The task force found that the
University "failed to explain the
four-year delay between Brendan
Gibbons' conduct and the perma-
nent separation," that it "failed to
investigate third-party complaints
of Gibbons' conduct within sixty
days of receiving the complaint,"
and that they believe "Brady Hoke
knowingly issued false statements
in December 2013 concerning the
status of Gibbons."
The findings cite an August
2013 phone call complaint to

Annual event draws
nearly 1,900 student
participants
By CHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily StaffReporter
For 24 hours, students,
survivors, caregivers and
community members gathered
at Palmer Field for MRelay, the
University's annual Relay for
Life.

Beginning at 10 a.m.
Saturday and ending at 10
a.m. Sunday, a host of student
organizations gathered to
participate in the relay, which
is one of hundreds held globally
to raise awareness and funds
for the American Cancer
Society. To participate, each
team has one member walking
the track at any given time.
About 1,900 students
registered for the event and 102
teams signed up. Many teams
were composed of members of

student organizations, Greek
Life and Club Sports teams.
MRelay leaders estimate that
3,000 to 5,000 people walked
the event during the day.
This year's event surpassed
the goal of $315,000 to raise
$316,041.08. MRelay will
continue to accept donations
through August. Last year's
MRelay raised about $312,000.
The relay is an opportunity
for those affected by cancer to
receive support and share their
stories. The event includes a

Luminaria Ceremony, which
commemorates those who lost
their battle with cancer by
placing a lighted paper latern
on the track in their honor
Business senior Kirby Jacobs,
a member of the MRelay senior
leadership team, said she most
anticipated speaking in honor
of her mother, who passed
away last summer from cancer,
during the ceremony.
"She was my hero, my every-
thing," Jacobs said. "I knew I

'U' institutes lottery for housing

39 years ago this week (April
15th, 1975)
Members of the University's
Board qf Regents said they did
not have previous knowledge of
a housing shortage for the next
year.
The University expected
a 5 to 6 percent increase in
freshmen for the upcoming
year, which combined with
higher re-application rates from
current students, meant that not
everyone who wanted housing
would receive it, necessitating a
lottery for housing.
Regent Paul Brown (D) said
before the lottery occurred, he
was not aware of the problem -
a sentiment echoed by several

other regents.
"I was not hit over the head
with any sort of prediction that
we were going to be short of
housing next fall," Brown said.

13th, 1984)

President Bashar Assad said the
conflict in Syria was shifting in
the government's favor.
"This is a turning point in
the crisis, both militarily in
terms of the army's continuous
achievements in the war against
terror or socially in terms of
national reconciliation and
growing awareness of the
true aims of the attack on the
country," state-run Syrian
television quoted Assad as
saying. He spoke to a group
of students and teachers from
Damascus University.
His comments follow a string
of government triumphs against
rebels, particularly around the
Syrian capital. Assad's forces
also have struck local cease-fire
agreements with the opposition
in a number of neighborhoods,
where weary rebels have turned
over their weapons in exchange
for an easing of suffocating
blockades.
Opposition groups, including
the main Western-backed Syr-
ian National Coalition, said the
poison gas attack at Kfar Zeita
hurt dozens of people, thought
it did not identify the gas used.
State-run Syrian television
blamed members of the al-
Qaida-linked Nusra Front rebel
group for the attack, saying they
used chlorine gas to kill two
people and injured more than
100. It did not say how it con-
firmed chlorine was used.
Chlorine, one of the most
commonly manufactured
chemicals in the U.S., is used to
purify drinking water. But as a
gas, it can be deadly.
Adham Raadoun, an
opposition activist on the edge
of Kfar Zeita, said government
helicopters dropped a number
of barrel bombs on the village
that appeared to carry the toxic
gas, killing one person and
choking about 100 people, many
of them in their homes.
Quoting eyewitnesses,
Raadoun said the gas had a
thick, yellowish color that
smelled of chlorine.

Shaka Senghor speaks about youth violence at the Socially Just Neighborhoods: Urban Communities Addressing Violence
and Incarceration event hosted at the School of Social Work Friday.
Former prisoner tls inner-
city violence, his experiences

Shaka Senghor stops
at School of Social
Work as part of
national tour
By CAROLINE BARON
Daily StaffReporter
Shaka Senghor, an author,
motivational speaker and
social activist, discussed the
perpetuated cycle of inner-city
violence and how his experience
in prison led him to speak and
write at the School of Social
Work Friday.
After he shot and killed a
man at age 19 and spent nearly
two decades in prison, Senghor
is now an author of six books,
youth mentor and recently
spoke at a regional TEDx
Conference. At the event,
Senghor discussed his life
growing up on the west side of
Detroit in an abusive home and
running away at age 13.
"One of the things that often
happen in inner cities and
tougher environments where
kids might run away is that
there are other people looking

to exploit them and so, after a
couple of weeks on the street,
I was seduced into the crack
trade," Senghor said.
Senghor said the violence
in his neighborhood was part
of everyday life. At 18, he was
shot working as a drug dealer
in Detroit's Brightmoor neigh-
borhood, an area afflicted with
crime, poverty and .abandoned
buildings. From then on, he car-
ried a gun wherever he went.
"I made up in my mind that
if I was ever in a conflict again,
I would shoot first," Senghor
said.
In response to one Social
Work professor's question
concerning how Senghor could
have benefited from a social
worker after he was shot, he
said a way to deal with the
trauma of violence would have
been crucial. He added that
counseling in underprivileged
areas is still lacking.
"I just knew he'd get
treatment or counseling; but
just like when I got shot, they
passed him up, sent him right
back to the hood, and nobody
ever intervened in that way,"
Senghor said of his shooter.
On a separate occasion, an

argument with a man to whom
Senghor was selling drugs
escalated into violence: Senghor
shot him to death. He was
sentenced to up to 40 years in
prison. Then, he said he learned
the power writing gave him to
atone and reflect on his life.
"I sat back and started journ-
aling," he said. "I was disgusted
with what my life turned out
to be, and more importantly I
was tired of hurting myself and
hurting others."
He spoke about solitary
confinement during his
19-year tenure in prison. He
was on 23-hour lockdown
five days a week and 24-hour
lockdown the other two days.
During this period, he became
depressed.
"I'm not sure if we think crit-
ically in American society about
what solitary confinement does
to human beings," . Senghor
said. "You get three five-minute
showers, and you're allowed to
go to recreation cages on breaks,
which is really a little dog ken-
nel, and when they bring you out
of your cell you're in handcuffs
with a leash attached to them.

Drinking water in
Fenton safe again
after leak fixed
Fenton authorities say it's
safe for everyone in the Genesee
County community to drink the
water again.
The city issued a boil-water
warning after discovering
Wednesday that a 6-inch water
man on Trealout St. was broken.
WEYI-TV says crews were
unable to make repairs without
depressurizing the system,
which allows bacteria to enter
pipes.
That led to the warning to
residents of a number of streets
and apartment complexes not to
use water without boiling it first.
The station reported Sunday
that Fenton has lifted the order
after confirming the system has
been decontaminated.

Authorities say three

Jewish community center and
retirement community, and two
were shot at but not injured.
Overland Park Police Chief
John Douglass said at a news
conference Sunday that the
person who had been reported to
be in critical condition was one of
the three dead.
Douglass said shots were fired
behind the Jewish Community
Center of Greater Kansas City in
a parking lot, and two males died.
Shots were reported minutes
later at the Village Shalom
retirement community, where
one female died.
Ages and identities of the
victims were not released.
A man in his 70s who is not

British police are appealing
for help finding five stolen dogs,
including a Chihuahua puppy that
recently won a major prize at the
prestigious Crufts competition.
The thieves apparently broke
into a house in the village of
Lissett in central England and
made off with the valuable dogs.
The best known was Xena,
named best Chihuahua puppy at
the annual Crufts dog show in
March. Her mother, grandmother
and two other Chihuahuas were
also taken.
Humberside police said Sunday
they are asking the public to

VERACRUZ, Mexico
Thirty-six dead
in bus crash on
Mexican highway
A passenger bus slammed
into a broken-down truck and
burst into flames, killing at least
36 people Sunday in southern
Mexico, the Veracruz state
government reported.
Both state and federal officials
said that four people survived
the crash, which occurred
shortly after midnight in the
southeastern state of Veracruz.
A communique from the state
civil defense agency said the vic-
tims were business people from
the region who were travelling
from the Tabasco state capital of
Villahermosa to Mexico City.
The agency's emergency
director, Ricardo Maza Limon,
said that victims apparently
burned to death inside the bus,
which was so badly charred that
the tires melted and the markings
on its sides were unreadable.

CSG
From Page 1A
the University's Title IX
coordinator regarding Gibbons'
2009 sexual misconduct as the
sole complaint submitted on
the subject. Gibbons was not
found responsible until Nov. 20,
2013, beyond the usual 60-day
deadline for beginning a sexual
misconduct investigation.
The findings also note a
2012-2013 OSCR Annual Report
stating that one instance of
sexual misconduct filed from
that year remained "Unresolved:
investigation in process." The
task force could not confirm that
this complaint was in reference
to the Gibbons case but, if so, it
would mean that more than a
year passed before the University
completed its investigation.
Additionally, the task force
found that OSCR and OIE were
unable to handle all the reports
of sexual misconduct by the
beginning of the 2012-2013
academic year. The University
acknowledged that it needed
more staff to handle all the
complaints. The report also
read that according to the OSCR
director, the OIE often was often
unable to investigate complaints
within the 60-day deadline. The
University didn't hire a second
investigator until 2014, far too
long after acknowledging the
problem of poor staff, the report
stated.
CSG President Michael
Proppe, a Business senior, said
this was more indicative of a
broader problem of how the
University deals with sexual
misconduct cases and less likely

an instance of an athlete being
given special privileges to keep
them eligible for play.
"The University was regularly
missing the 60-day deadline to
investigate sexual misconduct
and that delay could have
undermined the confidence that
survivors had in the process
and may have kept people from
coming forward," Proppe said.
Thetaskforce alsodetermined
that OSCR did not properly apply
the Statement of Students Rights
and Responsibilities - stating
that the University "improperly
prohibited student conduct
retroactively," using the interim
sexual misconduct policy or
finalized but not the pre-2011
policy that would have been in
effect when Gibbons' offenses
occurred. The findings note
that the differences in the new
and old policies are fairly small
and unlikely to change the OIE
findings but wanted to make it
clear the University could not
retroactively apply new policies
on old cases.
In a statement, University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said the University applauds
CSG's investigation, as it shows
the importance of the Student
Sexual Misconduct Policy.
"We appreciate that Central
Student Government takes
the issue of sexual misconduct
seriously, as do we," Fitzgerald
wrote inthe statement. "We hope
the CSG's focus on these issues
will lead to a greater awareness
of the student sexual misconduct
policy and even more survivors
coming forward."
Additionally, the task force
could only determine that
either OIE or OSCR did not

or else Hoke did indeed issue a
false statement; they were not
able to confirm one of these
scenarios specifically.
However, the report notes that
representatives from the Athlet-
ic Department do not believe the
OIE failed to notify the depart-
ment of a student-athlete being
accused of sexual misconduct
and it is the practice of the Asso-
ciate Athletic Director to notify
the head coach of the team of
the player in question. When
Michigan coach Brady Hoke said
Gibbons would not play in the
2013 Buffalo Wild Wings game
in December, Hoke said it was
because of a "family matter."
The task force report lists
Proppe's recommendations,
including that the University's
Board of Regents and other
administrators work to involve
students in such policy matters.
Also, it recommends that OSCR
reviews all sexual misconduct
cases occurring before the
interim policy but under the
proper policy applicable at the
time of the offense and that
OSCR files a report once they
complete this review.
Proppe also recommended
more clear and published
policies be developed in regard
to student-athlete disciplinary
information sharing between
departments, as well as creating
more straightforward policies
with the Ann Arbor Police
Department, the University
Police Department, OSCR and
OIE regarding sharing of student
conduct information.

solitary confinement."
Senghor completed two
novels in prison, which he
noted was rare for an inmate.
"I represent less than
1 percent of the solitary
confinement population who's
been able to make that leap,"
Senghor said.
Since his release in 2010,
Senghor has committed himself
to giving other prisoners
the opportunity to address
problems that are often
ignored. He started a program
called Live in Peace in which
he speaks to students in Detroit
and addresses emotional issues
he also grappled with.
He subsequently won the
Black Men Engagement of
Leadership Award funded
by the Knight Foundation,
which invests in community
innovation in American cities.
This led him to the
MIT Media Lab, an
"antidisciplinary" research
foundation. It was working in
Detroit to address ways that
technology could improve
production of new businesses
in the city. Senghor and
another member of the

time wisely.
"Find your locals, and you
build small and you build realis-
tically," Vial said.
Along with taking the next
step and getting featured on
a radio station, the speakers
stressed the importance of keep
track of finances.
DuPont said it was important
for musicians to spreadsheet
all of their expenses, whether
it is touring different towns
or purchasing new music
equipment.
"If you do that, you'll see how
much money you'll be making,
and you'll be surprised," DuPont
said.
The event closed with a con-
cert featuring various Ann
Arbor musicians, including San
Cristobal, Mike Vial, Brendan
Asante and KhrispyK.
Of the three teams that
competed, many participants
were AEPi brothers. Students
watched and cheered as the
participants gorged themselves
on doughnuts and face-planted
into plates of whipped cream.
"It's definitely entertaining
to watch boys be in an eating
competition," said LSA
sophomore Nicole Axelowitz, a
member of the Spoon University
public relations team.
However, after a record-
breaking winter, some students
were just excited to enjoy the
warmth.
"It's great just being outside
for the first time in months
and having everybody happy
and together and just doing
something for good cause,"
Axelowitz said.
MIT Media Lab created the
Atonement Project, dedicated
to bettering Detroit.
"Detroit is a very, very
complex city," Senghor said.
"While there are a lot of
amazing things taking place,
there's still a very different
reality that people are afraid
to talk about and afraid to
discuss. And that reality is
that there are people living
in communities who don't
have access to anything,
and there are police that
just don't respond in these
communities."
They brought the Atonement
Project to the University to
engage with the Prison Creative
Arts Project, an initiative
collaborating with incarcerated
people to strengthen creative
expression. Students can take
a class with Senghor and PCAP
director Ashley Lucas.
LSA senior Judith Rontal,
one of Senghor's students, said
Senghor emphasized a focus on
antoning for one's actions and
not judging someone on their
current situation.
"Perpetrators were often
victim," Rontal said. "We
try to bring this theme of
reconciliation and atonement
to our project, and the guys we
work with are so brilliant with
what they do with that."

said he hopes to bring a voice for
the students to City Council, but
his goals for the city go beyond
the interests of students. He said
thatafterresearchingthecurrent
state of local politics in Ann
Arbor, he sees developmental
and economic room for
improvement, particularly in
the way the council chooses to
allocate its funds.
"What started out my
interest in this campaign was to
represent the students that don't
have a voice on City Council, but
as I sort of researched the state of
politics in Ann Arbor, I realized
there are a lot of things I care
about," he said.
According to McMullen, there
is potential growth and progress
in areas of overspending on
policehospital and incarceration
needs in Ann Arbor. He added
that there is a need for affordable
housing and increased care for
the poor and homeless in Ann
Arbor, which was demonstrated

Though Jacobs had no experi-
ence with Relay for Life before
coming to the University, she
became involved as a Team
Captain during her freshman
year. Her mother, who had been
recently diagnosed with ovarian
cancer, attended the 2011 MRe-
lay and stayed with Jacobs over-
night in the 30-degree weather.
Kinesiology senior Sara
Knysh, executive director
of MRelay, said she also
participated in MRelay because
of her family's experiences with
cancer. This year was Knysh's
12th year being involved with
Relay for Life.
The relay moved back to its
usual location of Palmer Field
on Hill Campus this year after
taking place on Ferry Field in
2013. Knysh said the space at
Palmer Field allows for more
activities.
This year's MRelay was

"I think there are better ways
we can spend our money in
real ways Ann Arbor can stand
behind," McMullen said.
He added that relations
between the University and
the city would improve if he
were elected to City Council
and hopes to foster cooperation
and communication, and use
students at the University as a
resource for the city.
"There is a complete
disconnect between the Ann
Arbor community, the residents
and the students, and I think
that is a huge resource that isn't
being used," McMullen said.
"We have 40,000 students and
if you get students involved, then
real changes will happen and
everyone stands to benefit."
With the election of a new
mayor and the retirement of
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, an opportunity for real
change in Ann Arbor lies ahead,
he said.

For the past two years, MRelay
has sponsored a fashion show
with Rent the Runway, which
offers rentals of designer

year, MRelay paired up with
Ann Arbor restaurant guide Eat

Student organizations also

selling food or hosting activities.

In response to concerns about
McMullen's abilities to manage
being both a student and a City
Council member, Councilmem-

said she was optimistic about his
potential for the city, but recog-
nized the issues a student faces
in running for the council.
"The people who vote most

Renovating Detroit
Duggan's proposal will strengthen and help the Detroit community
April 9, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced that owners of 79
vacant homes in the Marygrove neighborhood will have three days
to make arrangements to fix up their homes before the Detroit
Land Bank Authority auctions them off to new homeowners. This marks
the beginning of the mayor's ambitious plan to target blight across the city.
The plan was realized with the help of Talmer Bank, which will offer each
bid-winning homeowner $25,000 of forgivable loans at the rate of $5,000
to be forgiven each year the owner lives in the home, for a maximum of
five years. This proposal is worthy of praise. It's an efficient form of blight
removal and control because it maintains salvageable homes and also works
with community members to guide the process.

Blessings in disguise

was set on Notre Dame. No
question about it. I had toured
the school and had fallen in
love with the
campus, the
students and the
tradition. Notre
Dame was the
school for me.
Unfortunately,
the kind folks at
the University
of Notre Dame PATRICK
Admissions MAILLET
Office didn't
agree.
When I received my rejection
letter, I was heartbroken. How
could this have happened? I worked
so hard throughout high school,
took SAT prep classes, wrote great
essays - Notre Dame was the
perfect fit for me.
After getting rejected from
the school of my dreams, I had to
decide which school would be the
right fit for me. I began touring the
schools that I had been accepted to.
Actually, to be fair, I only went on
one of these post-acceptance tours.
when I arrived in Ann Arbor for
the first time, I liked the general
feel, but wasn't entirely sold right
away. My tour guide was atrocious
and my parents and I were
famished. Instead of finishing the
tour, we dipped out midway through
as we passed through the Diag.
We decided to have lunch at this
quaint little restaurant called Good
Time Charley's. We had nachos
and talked about how terrible the
tour guide was. Little did I know
that three years later, I would be
celebrating my 21st birthday a few
feet from the very table we ate at -
a night I will remember forever ...
well most of it, at least.
After eating, we decided to
embark on a self-guided tour of
campus. During college visits,
my mom would always pick out
students and ask them about
the school. Though this method
was quirky and downright
embarrassing, it actually helped me
gauge schools and the type of kids
at the institution.
At Michigan, every kid my
mom stopped was ecstatic to tell
someone new about how much they
loved the school. I noticed that
everyone wore maize and blue and
everyone was involved in one of the
1,000-plus student organizations.

By the third kid my mom stopped, I
was sold; I knew that Michigan was
the place for me.
When move-in day came, my
parents and I noticed that my dorm
was not part of the original tour
we had gone on. In fact, the entire
campus my dorm was part of was
not seen during our tour. I had been
assigned to Bursley Hall on North
Campus and it didn't take me long
to realize my dorm was separated
from everything else. Needless to
say, I was upset.
While helping me move in, my
mom couldn't help but notice that
the kid across the hall from me was
playing some classic music. A die-
hard Bruce Springsteen fan, my
mom has a special place in her heart
for classic rock and approached the
kid to tell him that he was play-
ing some great hits. His name was
Chris and before I knew it, my mom
was introducing him to me. When
I met him, I had no idea that four
years later I would've lived with
Chris and that he and his friends
from high school would become
some of my most cherished friends.
The people that lived in my hall
with me in Bursley helped define

to, The Michigan Daily, I saw an
advertisement that said, "Write for
The Daily! Come to one of our mass
meetings!" Considering that I had
nothing else to do with my recently
freed-up schedule, I decided to
stop by. When I walked into the
newsroom of the Daily for the first
time, I had no idea that over the
next four years, I would sit on the
editboard, be an Assistant Editor of
the Opinion Section and eventually
a columnist. Though the Daily is
famous for its openness, it has but
one restriction on who can be on
staff: no members of CSG.
Throughout my life, my par-
ents have raised me to look at life's
mishaps as blessings in disguise.
Though this mindset is hard to
appreciate when life throws an
unfortunate obstacle your way,
accepting the fact that things hap-
pen for a reason is truly the key to
happiness. The fact that I am a stu-
dent at Michigan, writing this very
column. Even acknowledging some
of the people who are reading it are
all results of blessings in disguise.
I have written more than 50
pieces for The Michigan Daily.
This column will be my last. I will

Currently, blighted properties drive down
the prices of the surrounding houses and
neighborhoods, don't generate tax revenue
for the city and jeopardize the safety of the
surrounding area. This new program aims
to combat many of these issues, while also
stimulating the rehabilitation of clearly
salvageable properties in an important
area of Detroit - Marygrove College,
University of Detroit Mercy and Sinai-
Grace Hospital are all in the neighborhood
- with a free incentive to new homeowners.
In the future, this new plan will serve to
increase neighborhood safety, generate tax
revenue and drive up the property values in
the neighborhood.
However, Detroit must be cautious of the
fact that not all homeowners of abandoned
houses have left them intentionally, and
that this program shouldn't have an agenda
to push new homeowners into the area
while pushing community members out. In
order to ensure that current homeowners
receive adequate help and information
in retaining their homes, the city should
reach out to residents at risk of losing their
homes and provide them with preventative

assistance and help in acquiring control
of their foreclosed homes. Furthermore,
though the Detroit homes are salvageable,
the Talmer Bank loans of $25,000 each
may not be sufficient for full reparation.
In the future, larger loans may be needed
to fully incentivize homeowners to make
the necessary repairs. Other land banks
within the area - many of which are already
involved in some sort of corporate giving in
Detroit - should also partner with the city
to help expand the scope and scale of the
loans.
Duggan's plan is a step in the right direction
- many other cities such as Minneapolis
and Baltimore have implemented similar
programs to combat blight. A similar measure
has been taken in New Haven, Conn., with the
formation of a task force called Real Options
Overcoming Foreclosure.
Blight removal is a major stepping-stone
in the revival of Detroit. Duggan's plan
for forgivable loans will drive up property
valie, incentivize migration into the city
and expand the tax base. Both Duggan and
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder must help
expand this program to a larger scale.

Funding the Michigan Difference

Student organizations at the University of
Michigan are an incredible source of vibrancy
and community on our campus. More than
1,400 of our organizations are run by students
and for students to provide our campus with
opportunities for personalgrowth, professional
development, education and advocacy. Students
benefit massively from student organizations
and their activities, gaining not only skills, but
memories and friendships that they will retain
well beyond their days in Ann Arbor.
Theonlymissionofthe StudentOrganization
Funding Commission of the Central Student
Government is to support these students and
their organizations.We provide about $300,000
a year in funding for students to explore
our world, make it a better place, educate
themselves andbethe Michigan Difference.We
are committed to ensuring that as many events
as possible take place on our campus, and that
the events we fund have a broad campus impact
or bring benefit to students, faculty and staff
at the University. We are focused on providing
funding to a wide cross section of campus.
Last semester alone, we funded 222 groups,
providing more than $130,000 in funding.
We provide funds for conferences, speakers,
performances, social events, travel, service and
many, many other types of student activities.
It's almost impossible for a student to graduate
from the University without attending at least
one CSG-funded event.
We're very proud of this impact, and
humbled that you, the students of the
University of Michigan, have entrusted us
with such an important responsibility. But
we believe that our impact has been limited
by our own funding constraints, something
that inhibits us from supporting students.
Our mission is simple, to enable students to
do what they want to do. We are not failing
that mission, but we're not achieving it in
the manner we would like. Each year, we
receive an average of $1.16 million in funding

requests and we only have about $300,000
to disburse. That means we're leaving more
than $700,000 of student requests for funding
unmet, forcing the cancellation of some events
and the re-organization of others. We don't
believe that this is right, fair or appropriate
for a campus that values student activities and
boasts about the number and activity level of
its student organizations. Ideally, we would
like to be able to fund every student group
that walks in the door, allowing all students
to achieve what they wish to achieve. This is
impossible with our current level of funding,
and is, in reality, almost impossible to ever
achieve. But we believe we can and we must do
more. CSG exists to serve students, and if we
have to turn away hundreds of students who
need thousands of dollars, then we are not
doing our job the way it ought to be done.
This is why I and my fellow co-chairs of the
Student Organization Funding Commission
wholeheartedly and unequivocally support a $2
increase in the CSG student fee. This increase
will generate a minimum of $75,000 for SOFC,
all of which will be budgeted to support student
organizations in their important endeavors.
The cost increase is less than the cost of a cup
of coffee, but the impact will be immeasurable,
increasing the already impressive diversity
of events and programming on campus, and
allowing Michigan students to achieve their
best. The increase is covered under financial
aid,andwebelievethatitwillnotbedetrimental
to students to pay $2 more for the benefits they
will receive. We are conscious of the rising cost
of education, but we believe that education is
not just what you learn in the classroom, but
what you learn outside of its four walls, and
that we should all be willing to pitch in at least
a little bit to enrich our Michigan experience,
and make our time at Michigan more valuable.
Alex Abdun-Nabi is the Co-Chair ofnthe
Student Organization Commission.

A bout two weeks
ago, someone very
important to me
moved away. I helped him pack
his things into a car much too
small to fit
four years
of college
life. On his
last night, a
group of us s
sat around
on stained
couches KAYLA
and shared UPADHYAYA
our favorite
memories
of him. Except me. Because
I hate goodbyes. The next
morning, before he drove
away in his filled-to-the-brim
Range Rover, I kept most of
what I wanted to say to myself
as we hugged and waved.
I've never done too well
with goodbyes. And as with
most things in my life, I think
that probably has something to
do with my love of television.
You see, us TV obsessers never
do too well with closure.
We're spoiled. When we find
a new show to settle down
with, we (usually) get to be a
part of that world and spend
time with those characters for
years.
I've watched a lot of series
finales over the years and feel
pretty comfortable declaring
that they're mostly garbage.
Particularly in the world of
broadcast television, so long
as a show is making enough
money, the show keeps on
getting made, even when it
should probably be put to rest.
In these cases, by the time we
get to the end, the writers have
squeezed every drop of blood
out of the series that we're left
with something hollow and
sagging that looks nothing like
the show you fell in love with.
"Alias," for instance,
devolved into an entirely dif-
ferent show after its third sea-
son (I would say "never forget
those season-four zombies, but
you should actually definitely
forget about them because
what?") If you are one of those
people who stopped watching
"Battlestar Galactica" during

its final season, I don't blame
you. In fact, don't force your-
self to finish it. It's not a polar-
izing finale like that of "Lost"
or "The X-Files" - it's just
straight-up bad.
Most days, I pretend seasons
six and seven of "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer" never even
happened. Of course, that
would mean we never would
have gotten "Once More
With Feeling" or "Tabula
Rasa" or "Selfless," the rare
but treasured gems buried
among trash like "Doublemeat
Palace" and "First Date"
(another thing you should
erase from your TV memory:
"Special Guest Star Ashanti").
Maybe it would have been
worth drudging through all
that hell if the series finale
had recaptured the heart and
soul of the series. But it didn't.
Instead, it validates an abusive
relationship (Spike/Buffy) and
spends way too much time on
the season's most boring plot
device (the Potentials). Worst
of all, Anya dies, and the entire
Scooby Gang spends about two
seconds being sad about ituntil
they start patting themselves
on the backs for saving the
world. I'm still mad at Joss
Whedon for that one. Season
five's finale "The Gift" should
have been the series finale. I'll
stand by that opinion to my
grave.
Do you even remember what
happened in the "Gilmore
Girls" finale? Lorelai kissed
Luke and Rory decided to fol-
low the Obama campaign. It
was 2007, I was 14 years old,
and I was so disappointed in
the remarkably average ending
to the series that backdropped
my after-school snack time for
seven years that I turned off
my TV and stormed upstairs
to air my grievances on the
message boards, because
that's what you did in the pre-
Twitter days.
Flash forward to today. As I
wrote that paragraph, I shared
my very strong feelings with
my friend Alex and he looked
at me like I was a monster.
Before I know it, we're
watching a scene from the
finale. Richard tells Lorelai
what an amazing mother and
person she is and suddenly
I'm sobbing in Mighty Good.
What? Where were these feels
seven years ago? Why can I so
distinctly remember slumping
away from that finale so
unsatisfied?
Well, the obvious answer
is that I'm a different person
now. I'm weeks away from
graduating, and watching
Rory say goodbye to all the
people she loves so she can
start the next phase of her life
hits way too close to home.
TV doesn't exist in a vacuum;
when we watch, we bring in
parts of ourselves and our
lives, that affect the way we
interpret and receive what we
see on s creen.
But even though the
"Gilmore Girls" series finale
has more emotional power
over me now than it did
seven years ago, I still found
myself snapping, "yeah, but
that Lorelai-Luke kiss is still
so anticlimactic," at Alex as
I wiped away my tears and

remembered I'm supposed to
hate this episode.
Yes, the "Gilmore Girls"
series finale is anticlimactic.
Of course it is. The only shows
that don't have anticlimactic
finales are the ones that are
canceled before the writers
get to write a true finale.
Well, and "Angel" 's "Not
Fade Away," which somehow
manages to end on an upbeat
note but also with a sense of
finality, and I'm not really
sure how it strikes such
a magical balance; I'd be
tempted to say Joss Whedon
is a wizard, but again, see: the
"Buffy" finale. Series finales
are anticlimactic because
they're not climaxes; they're
resolutions. There's a reason
why penultimate episodes
are almost always going to be
better than finales: They're
the exciting buildup and the
finale is the slow exhale. I
gave "30 Rock" 's finale an A+,
but "A Goon's Deed in a Weary

World" is a better episode.
So, yeah, even the finales
I love never leave me wholly
satisfied. Everyone loves the
"Friday Night Lights" finale,
but WHERE WAS SMASH
WILLIAMS, HUH? Sure,
there are about a million
logistical reasons the writers
probably couldn't bring back
Smash - many of which were
probably out of their control.
But how can I be logical about
the television industry and all
its moving parts at a time like
this?! When I'm emotionally
fragile, logic and reason pack
up their bags, and few things
make me as emotionally
fragile as a series finale.
Because series finales are
goodbyes and goodbyes are
always going to suck. There's
no such thing as a perfect
goodbye. You're always going
to want more time. You're
always going to wish you had
done something differently.
This is my last television col-
umn for The Michigan Daily
and I know I have about a
hundred more columns in me,
and, yes, most of them would
probably include the words
"feminist," "the CW" and
"witches" because those are
indeed my favorite things to
write about. I never wrote that
column about "H20: Just Add
Water." I never wrote about
how my dad learned English
from American television
when he emigrated from India
or how he used to say phrases
like "I can't do it, captain"
and "beam me up, Scotty" so
often when I was growing up
that I thought they were just
regular American idioms and
not references to a TV show.
That one probably would have
been called "Kayla Upadhy-
aya: TV is in my DNA" and,
as usual, I would have pissed
off my editors by writing 500
words over the limit.
Saying goodbye
is never easy.
So don't make
me say it, please.
So, if this column is my
series finale, I hope it's like
the "Clarissa Explains it
All" finale, in which Clarissa
writes her very last article
for the school paper and
everyone is sad but then she
dedicates the article to The
Future, which is I guess what
I dedicate this column to, too.
But this column is probably
more like that "Gilmore Girls"
finale; it's not my best work,
it could be better, but it'll
possibly make me cry in seven
years when I revisit it.
I apologize in advance to
everyone who have to say
goodbye to in a few weeks. I
got a taste of what it's going
to be like two weeks ago, and
I can tell you, it's definitely
going to suck, and it's
definitely not going to satisfy.
It's going to feel like your
favorite TV show is coming
to an end. And maybe those
two characters who you were

always rooting for don't end
up together. And maybe not
everyone gets a happy ending.
But looking back, you're going
to remember your favorite
episodes and not that painful
goodbye.
OK, I might be a little too
married to this metaphor.
But so long as we're lost deep
within it, I'll keep it going by
calling the post-grad part of
my life my spinoff series. I'm
off to Los Angeles to try to be
a professional Funny Lady,
whatever that means, and to
hopefully eventually create
my own TV series that ends
up at the top of everyone's "10
Shows With the Best Series
Finales" lists.
But it probably won't.
Because I'm terrible at
goodbyes. So don't make me
say it, please.
This is Upadhyaya's last
column. To thank her for her work,

AMC's 'Turn' to 1700s

"Ain't nobody got time for this!"
Stu nnig'Oculus'

Film calls upon
horror classics in
winning story
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
This past weekend I had
forgotten my ID when I went to see
"Oculus" with some friends, and
the cashier told
me she could
not admit me.
It was against Oculus
policy to admit
anyone into an AtQuality 16
R-rated film and Rave
under the age Relativity Media
of 18 without a
legal guardian
after "bedtime." I am beardless
and skinny; I look like a child. I
have no ID and my friends, who
are younger and shorter than I,
must now argue on my behalf. Yep.
This is feeling 22. I start laughing.
Kids may buy tickets to watch
"Rio 2," but when no one is watch-
ing, they will steal away into the
theater to see what others would
protect them from. The fact I have
to grovel my way past security
confirms that our fascination in
horror and violence is still strong,
and our desire to "protect the
children"stronger yet. And "Ocu-
lus," a near masterpiece, demon-
strates'the ability of that genre to
lead us further into the territory
of madness in a well-structured,
well-executed story that tests and
violates your sensibilities.
Call "Oculus" the MacGyver of
horror. Like the "Saw" franchise
(a dumber concept), there is a
winding assembly of machines in
this film, and they are set going on
a clock right off the start.
Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites,
"Blue Lagoon: The Awakening") is
a man recently freed from a mental
institution, determined to split
himself from the past. As a child,
he shot dead his own philandering
father, whom the police called
a sick man in need of help. His
mother is also dead, driven to
insanity at the end of her life.

Tim is free to move on and
continue his healing process. But
his sister, Kaylie Russell (Karen
Gillan, TV's "Doctor Who"), has
other plans. To her, the guilty
party has yet to be revealed.
She believes their father was
not seduced by a woman, but by
something else: a mirror. A mirror
that possesses you and consumes
you. The siblings reunite at last,
and she has decided for the both
of them, they will destroy this
paranormal object.
The buildup to this showdown
takes time and energy, sometimes
overwrought, sometimes over-
dramatic, and you may wonder
whether there will be a payoff
- a pouring of gore (the money
shot) or at least a jump scare. It's
tedious, but you have to admire
the plot's mechanics (Despite the
really dumb-lookingghosts.)
The structure of this film is
almost untouchable. Much of the
plot operates through flashbacks.
Two timelines move parallel
to each other: the past and the
present. Writer-director Mike
Flanagan ("Absentia"), who based
this feature-length film on his
own short film "Oculus: Chapter
3", moves between these two
dimensions effortlessly. But the
mirror, a supernatural force, as
the tagline of the film puts it, only
lets you see what it wants you to
see. These two dimensions, past
and present, overlap. That the
brother's and sister's sense of
reality is also split from each other
only exacerbates the problem,
makes it more complex, and yes,
horrifying. This is perhaps the
film's most unsettling quality: the
mirror delineates reality.
All of the mirror's victims have
gazed into its reflection. You see
their yearning, an excruciating
sense of incompleteness, and they
want inside its image. Each time
reality is split, fissured, fractured
into shards, our dread grows.
The characters are fighting their
madness, kicking off its cloak
like they're trying to wake from
a nightmare, and the horror lies
in a realization: what have I done
while I was away?

The mirror itself, once brought
into the room, fills the atmosphere
with ghosts. By virtue of there
being a reflection, there is already
the added presence of unseen
observers. Horror films are most
electric with dread when we sense
eyes on our back. Their voyeurism
fills uswith premonition. And the
mirror is a great eye (an oculus)
that opens alternate realities,
ghosts that trace the curve of our
spines.
Two horror classics, "A
Nightmare on Elm Street" and
"The Shining" explored similar
themes of madness and reality
through the manipulation of
their physical and figurative
space of setting. Freddy Krueger,
a specter of a killer, bends and
reshapes the boundaries of the
dream and reality. You descend
into aplace whose horror depends
on the imagination of its villain.
The Torrance family wanders
the passageways of an immense
hotel. You lose your way and you
lose yourself. "Oculus," however,
brings you into the intimacy of a
home. Its killers are mothers and
fathers, brothers and sisters.
The visual culture of Japan
understands the terror of
mutation. The perversion of
nature, the Unnatural, repulses
our sensibilities. It goes against
our innate sense of what is
"correct." As in "Akira," which
provides one of the most stunning
transformations in cinema, you
can still see where there was once
a human. In "Oculus" you will find
yourself thinking: This was once
a mother, a father and so on. The
power of mutilation is profound
in our imaginations. (I would
also recommend playing through
the "Silent Hill" franchise. Just a
screenshot makes me tighten up)
Still, this is a film that under-
stands possession, its essence, the
deeper reason why itnterrifies us: It
is the agony of living in a body not
your own. In a mind outside your
control. This is why we wander
into the dark and invite horror into
ourlives. We come because we like
the thrill, we are masochists and
sadists, and it leaves usviolated.

By JOE REINHARD
Daily Arts Writer
You shouldn't always judge a
show by its pilot, but in the case
of AMC's "Turn," it's hard not to
have a few res-
ervations. For a
program that's
supposed to be Turn
a mix of a spy
thriller and a SeriesPremiere
Revolutionary Sundays at 9 p.m.
War drama, it's AMC
disappointing
that the first 90
minutes aren't as exciting as one
would hope. The show opts for
a slow-burn approach, and that
isn't to say there's nothing to
enjoy here, but it's clear it'll take
some time before there's any
real payoff. Luckily for "Turn,"
its first episode, a well-rounded
premiere if nothing extraordi-
nary, helps it along in proving
itself a worthwhile investment.
In part, that's because the
program's slower pace is rather
deliberate. Just by taking a look
at the source material - Alexan-
der Rose's book "Washington's
Spies: The Story of America's
First Spy Ring" - it's interesting
to see the show's approach to
the history. "Turn" stars Jamie
Bell ("The Adventures of Tin-
tin") as Abe Woodhull, a man
who's hesitant to work as a spy
because of conflicting priorities
between family, country and
what he feels is right. Because
the book doesn't give Abe's per-
spective alone, they could have
easily chosen a more heroic lead,
such as Benjamin Tallmadge
(Seth Numrich, "The Good
Wife"), whose early involve-
ment with the rebellion could
have lent itself to more exciting
stories sooner in the season.
Instead we primarily follow
Abe, and as of right now, he's not
the most interesting character.
Bell does a fine job in the role
though, so it should be interest-

'Silicon Valley' shows promise

By EMILY BODDEN
DailyArts Writer
"Silicon Valley," HBO's newest
series, premiered last Sunday,
April 6, and it seems to hold a
lot of promise.
Despite its
underwhelming
pilot, the show Siliwn
as a whole
seems to be a Valley
smorgasbord Series Premiere
of other well-
reevd Sundays at 10 p.m.
received
comedies - HBO
particularly
prominent in the writing of the
characters.
Intelligently constructed, the
showtakes place in the titular Sil-
icon Valley and revolves around
website and app developers.
Unlike Comedy Central's "Work-
aholics," the type of work that the
characters do is very much at the
show's forefront. Several times
during the premiere, a social
hierarchy within the tech world
is established. While the writers
obviously play up stereotypes (the
coders are described as "douche-
bags" and characterized much
like the douchey jocks that can be
found roaming the halls of Ameri-
ca's high schools), it seems crucial
to the show's future development.
Even within a world that could
easily be filled with the dorki-

est and smartest kids you grew
up with, audiences discover that
Richard (Thomas Middleditch,
"The Wolf of Wall Street") and his
friends still remain at the bottom
of the social ladder, casted as the
underdogs.
Some of the secondary charac-
ters are brilliantly written. Some
personal favorites include Peter
Gregory (the late Christopher
Evan Welch, "War ofthe Worlds")
and the doctor (Andy Daly, "East-
bound and Down"). Welch plays
Peter Gregory beautifully. In his
first scene, Gregory gives a TED
Talk with a cadence so painfully
awkward and forced that it's clear
the writers are entirely famil-
iar with the banality of the real
TED lectures. The doctor gives
nods to Dr. Spaceman from
NBC's "30 Rock" through a few
slightly incompetent and self-
involved mannerisms. His pitch
at the end of the visit, which
sent Richard into even more of
a downward spiral, is similar
to the times Tracey visited Dr.
Spaceman in "30 Rock."
But not all of the secondary
characters are welcome
inclusions; having a hot, yet
well-informed techie as a
love interest for our socially
awkward, but endearing
protagonist, seems undeniably
trite. Even if Richard does
not get romantically involved

with Monica (Amanda Crew,
"Charlie St. Cloud"), the writers
will surely play up the sexual
tension. Hopefully HBO doesn't
fall into this repetitive pattern
and instead looks to use the
character for something more
compelling.
HBO's latest has
plenty room
for growth.
The character Gavin (Matt
Ross, "American Psycho")
seems like he could have
been taken out of a sketch in
"Portlandia." When Richard
goes into his office to discuss
selling his website, all of Gavin's
employees gush about their
employer in a seemingly cult-
like manner. While Richard
does not prescribe to the vibes
of Gavin's office, the discomfort
of the relationships permeated
the scene.
While notHBO'sbestpremiere,
"Silicon Valley"has plenty ofroom
to grow. The characters, evoking
those of shows past, are solid, and
the writers have set themselves
up for potential greatness as the
season progresses.

"What year is it?"
Postmodernism and
Gondry's 'Is the Man...

So how does Gondry try
to not to let us forget the
cuts? The first three minutes
and thirty seconds provide
an overture to the work as
whole, at least in this regard.
The film's exposition works
to reveal and subvert the
inherent coerciveness of film
by inventorying the film's
cinematic tools. The very first
frame, squarely bird's-eye-
view over Gondry's backlit
animation desk, displays
Gondry's colorful palate of
Sharpies. Then Gondry's hand
physically enters the frame,
declaring, "Here I am! I am the
filmmaker manipulating the
film." His hand draws a hand,
desk, lamp and sheet of paper.
Once again, he is inventorying,
saying, "This is the stuff of my
film." Gondry's hand exits the
frame and the now animated
hand begins to draw. It draws
a cartoon Gondry sitting at a
desk, creating the animation.
Lastly, on the subtitle frame,
Gondry displays his own Bolex
film camera, which he used
to record his conversation
with Chomsky. Thus here, in
short, is supposed to be the
(at least partial) achievement
of Gondry's goal of artistic
honesty: deliberate showing
of the constitutive elements
of his film in order to expose
the subjectivity of Gondry's
artistic interpretation.
But I'm not convinced that
Gondry is really as honest
as he's trying to be, and
I'm skeptical that he's even
capable of being so honest
considering the constraints of
human "psychic continuity,"
which he recognized himself.
Gondry sees animation as
distinctly different from other
forms of film. Thereby he
grants (his) animation relative
propagandistic immunity.
But this is strange to
me. Why should animation
be exempt from Gondry's
critiques of film? Gondry
gave us some reasons, but I'm
not so sure they hold up. For
example, when I was a kid,
Bugs Bunny didn't feel like it
was "clearly the interpretation

of its author." One might
argue, "Oh, you were just a
child then." But I would say
that I'm still a child now,
especially when I'm watching
a movie. Even when Looney
Tunes were at their epitome of
meta postmodern expression
(e.g., "Duck Amuck"), I never
felt like I was really aware of
the manipulative influence
of its author - especially not
while I was watching. I didn't
feel like I was "constantly
reminded that (I wasn't)
watching reality" - not when
I was watching Road Runner
and not when I was watching
"Is the Man Who Is Tall
Happy?"
The only time viewers can
be conscious of the author's
influence is when the flow
of psychic continuity is dis-
rupted (e.g., with analytic
thought like the kind Gondry
demonstrates in his inciting
explication). This is to say,
psychic continuity can only
be disrupted when the view-
er sees "the cuts." But, like
gestalt figure-ground draw-
ings of faces and goblets, the
viewer cannot see the cuts and
maintain the flow of psychic
continuity simultaneously.
So, despite Gondry's senti-
ments, his animation cannot
subvert the coerciveness of
film because animation is no
exception to the principle that
film must maintain psychic
continuity for the viewer.
Gondry's unfulfilled goal of
artistic honesty represents a
greater problem of the present
postmodern project. Despite
many of the postmodernists'
attempts at self-exposition
and self-deprecation through
repeated self-reference, they
often cannot escape the under-
lying hypocrisy of their own
creative critiques. For those
who worry about such prob-
lems - artists, writers, think-
ers, etc. - it presents us with
an opportunity for new solu-
tions. How will this problem
be solved? How will the next
art and philosophy movement
look? Thankfully, the answers
seem to still be undecided.

ofthe film by Gondry that
reveals the film's intended
philosophical and artistic
paradigm in a very useful way,
analytically speaking.
Accompanied by his own
handwritten scrawl, Gondry
(off-screen) speaks directly to
the audience:
"Film and video are both
by their nature manipulative:
the editor/director proposes
an assemblage of carefully
selected segments that he/
she has in mind ... And, as a
result, the voice that appears
to come from the subject
actually comes from the
filmmaker. And that's why I
find the process manipulative:
the human brain forgets the
cuts - a faculty specifically
human, that, as I will
learn, Noam calls psychic
continuity. The brain absorbs
a constructed continuity as a
reality and consequently gets
convinced to witness a fair
representation of the subject."
Gondry does an excellent
job reciting the typical
postmodernist claims about

film: Film often pretends not to
be film and that, more or less,
makes it coercive. Therefore
postmodern filmmakers want
to find ways to make films that
express this critique without
being hypocritical.
In this film, Gondry does so
with animation. "(Animation)
is clearly the interpretation of
its author. If messages, or even
propaganda, can be delivered,
the audience is constantly
reminded that they are not
watching reality."
The film, therefore, can be
seen through the lens of Gon-
dry's desire not to deceive the
audience. And thus his goal for
the rest of the film has been
firmly established: Don't let
the audience "forget the cuts."

Men's gymnastics
champions again

Second-ranked
Wolverines complete
perfect season
By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
The word 'perfect' is almost never
mentioned in gymnastics, a sport
that adheres countless deductions
to the smallest of errors, but the
Michigan men's gymnastics team's
performance Friday night came
pretty darn close.
After finishing the regular season
undefeated and then winning the
Big Ten championship, the second-
ranked Wolverines wrapped up

their perfect season by winning the
National Championship with a score
of 445.050. Competing at home in
the Crisler Center, Michigan edged
out second place Oklahoma and third
place Stanford to reach the pinnacle
of collegiate gymnastics for a second
straight year.
The Wolverines earned the first
repeat national championship in
school history since the Trampoline
program did so in 1969-1970. Friday
also marked the third championship
in five years for Michigan, and its
sixth all time.
"It just doesn't get any better
than winning it at home," said
Michigan coach Kurt Golder. "And
this is my fourth one, and they are
all great, but winning it in front of

a Michigan crowd in Crisler Center.
And then it being a repeat, it just
makes it all the sweeter. I couldn't
ask for anything more."
In addition to winning back-to-
back team championships, senior
Sam Mikulak also took home back-
to-back all-around titles, with a
total score of 91.10. Mikulak had the
highest score in three out of the six
events on the night, highlighted by
his performances on parallel bars
and floor exercise.
His individual title, the sixth
individual championship of his
career, leaves him only two short
of holding the most individual
championships in NCAA history
ahead of Saturday's conipetition.
See CHAMPS, Page 2B

Mikulak equals record with seventh title

Senior struggles but
still makes history
Saturday night

Hartung and Illinois' Joe Giallombardo.
One more first-place finish to earn
seven titles. And after a long night of
underwhelming routines, Mikulak
finally earned his place in history.
"It feels good," Mikulak said. "That's
a great class of men to be a part of, and
I'mhonored to be one ofthose gymnasts
who will forever be remembered."
Mikulak's night started on pommel
horse, but his usually tight routine
fell apart at the seams with a couple
of failed moves. He would finish
with a 13.250 for 10th

place out of 10.
With an opportunity to make up for
his mistakes on floor, Mikulak couldn't
stick dismounts to earn a final score of
15.125 - good enough for fourth place,
just ahead of his teammate, Stacey
Ervin, who took fifth.
On his next attempt,
the vault, ult._

Mikulak's dismount doomed him once
again, and he finished eighth. Even
freshman Tristan Perez-Rivera finished
ahead of him in seventh.
So with one final event remaining, the
parallel bars, Mikulak found himself in
a pressure-packed situation. He had
one shot for the history books, so he
had to feel some anxiousness, right?
"You know what they say: nope,"
Mikulak said with a laugh.
And
perhaps
there
shouldn't
have
been.

Just two weeks ago, Mikulak set a new
NCAA record in the event. The night
before, he was just .05 points away from
tying it. If anything, a strong parallel
bars routine was expected of him.
As Mikulak released the bars to enter
his dismount, Crisler Center held its
breath. The crowd didn't know what to
expect after his first three routines.
Mikulak stuck
the dismount. The
green flag - the
sign for an added
stick bonus -
flew in the air.

Friday, the night Superman fell

On the horizontal bar,
the full-twisting double
back release requires the
gymnast to release both hands
and perform two backflips and a
360-degree twist above the bar
before regrasping the bar.
All of this is to say:
Gymnastics is unlike almost any
other sport on campus in that
you or I could never execute any
of the skills
involved.
Any of
them. You
can throwa
javelin. Not
far - but
you can
throw a ZACH
javelin. You HELFAND
can catch
a football.
You can
make a jump shot. You can swim
and run and kick and swing.
You cannot do a full-twisting
double back release. I couldn't
even do a swing around the bar.
And that is precisely what
has made Sam Mikulak the best
athlete on campus for the past
four years. He has the individual
titles: seven of them now, tied
for the most in NCAA men's
gymnastics history. He has won
three all-around titles. He has
been a part of two team national
titles. This alone makes him one
of the most successful Michigan
athletes of all time.
But it's the way he has done
all of this - in skills that most
others can't even dream of
performing - that ismost
impressive. And his command
of these skills is unmatched in
college gymnastics.
The full-twisting double back
release isn't Mikulak's alone or
even his trademark skill. There
is now a skill on the pommel
horse officially called the
"Mikulak." This skill isn't like
that. But it's Mikulak's mastery
of it - of all his skills, really -
that sets him apart.

ALLISON FARRAND (LEFT) AND ADAM GLANZMAN (RIGHT)/Daily
Senior gymnast Sam Mikulak, star of the Michigan men's gymnastics team, fell to the mat Friday, but he recovered and the Wolverines took the title the next night.

Golder called the "domino effect."
"One guy goes up and misses,
and then the next guy misses,"
Golder said. "It's really hard to
get turned around sometimes."
And then Michigan had its
lowest score of the night on the
horizontal bar, and Mikulak
was up to turn it around as
he always does, and then he
dropped his feet down too low
and held onto the bar too long,
and he missed the bar and
disaster struck.
Now, everything was in
question.
"He never misses," Golder
said of Mikulak. But Mikulak
had just missed.
Oklahoma was now within
striking distance of Michigan's
team score. Stanford's excellent
freshman Akash Modi was
now .100 off Mikulak's once
unassailable all-around lead.
The Wolverines watched
Mikulak's routine from yards
away. When he fell, some put
their hands over their heads.
Some turned away.
Remember that depth? Next
up: Hub Humphrey, a junior
from Kalamazoo, Mich. who
only competed on the floor. He
was coming in cold.
The dominoes were falling.
Could Humphrey stop gravity?
He hit his routine. The
dominoes stopped.
Then Tristian Perez-Rivera
hit too, and so did Syque Caesar,
and so did Stacey Ervin, who
was competing with a torn bicep.
All that was left was Mikulak,
and it was all over then for
Oklahoma and for Modi and for
anyone else.
Sam Mikulak had fallen. And
now it was over because he got
back up.
Helfand can be reached
at zhelfand@umich.edu or
on Twitter @zhelfand.

After the national
championship meet on Friday,
a meet that would determine
the team champion and the
all-around champion, Mikulak
estimated that he had gone two
months without missingthat
trick.
And that was why it was such
a shock to everyone at a raucous
Crisler Center Friday when Sam
Mikulak - star of collegiate
gymnastics, defier of gravity,
master of the full-twisting
double back - released the bar
and performed two backflips
and a 360-degree twist and
then missed the bar and fell to
the mat.
For Michigan, repeat national
championships are rarer than
positive rushing plays in a
football game.
The men's gymnastics team

entered Friday with a chance to
become the school's first repeat
champion in any sport since the
trampoline team (seriously) in
1969-70.
So how did Michigan reach
this point?
"Our first two years went
horribly," Mikulak said,
referring to the 2011 and 2012
seasons. "We lost too many
times."
In two years, they recognized,
the team would be loaded
with upperclassmen - 19 of
25 gymnasts on the roster this
season are juniors or seniors. So
they regrouped, and they started
a mantra, "MGymDynasty,"
which they plastered all over
social media.
This wasn't just a struggling
team's plan to improve. This
was a strategy for dominance.
Michigan wanted multiple
championships.
"We let every single team out

there know that this is what
we're going for," said Syque
Caesar, a graduate student and
the first Michigan athlete to win
three national championships.
"Sure, other teams might
laugh at it, but it was a tangible
element."
Michigan's secret is its depth,
a product of its experienced
roster. In postseason team
competition, five gymnasts
must compete in each of the six
disciplines. All five scores count.
One low score can tank the meet.
The Wolverines went
30-0 this season because
little separates their best
gymnasts from their worst.
Mark Williams, the coach of
Michigan's top challenger,
Oklahoma, said he knew his
gymnasts would have to hit on
all 30 of their routines Friday to
have a shot at Michigan and the
championship.
The Sooners, though, were

less than perfect on the parallel
bars, and Michigan was
nearly flawless on the pommel
horse, the trickiest of the six
disciplines. One rotation in,
Michigan just needed to hold on.
Mikulak went last in all
the rotations. Each time,
his presence either added
an exclamation point to a
successful rotation or stopped
the bad momentum before it
spread. He stuck his pommel
horse landing. He had a
solid routine on rings. When
Michigan showed its first
cracks on the vault, Mikulak
stuck the landing. Michigan
coach Kurt Golder, usually
reserved, gave a big fist pump.
On the parallel bars, no one
had stuck a double pike to that
point. Mikulak did, of course.
He scored a 16.050 - tied (with
himself) for the highest score of
the night.
The only worry was what

While there weren't many
Wolverines who could say they
had a good game, freshman
goaltender Robbie Zonino was
phenomenal in the cage.
Zonino had 15 saves, many
of them acrobatic, even though
Ohio State dominated most of
the offensive posessions.
"Robbie played great," Paul
said. "He had a couple clearing
mistakes, but he saved us a lot
of times, which is what a good
goalie should do."
One of the biggest themes
of Michigan's season has been
inconsistency. After playing
one good half and one bad half
last week against Fairfield, the
Wolverines repeated that same
performance this week.With the
four-team ECAC Tournament
looming, Michigan will have
to curb the inconsistency if
it wants a chance to win the
conference title.
"Last year, at this time,
we lose a game and we had
nothing to play for other than
pride," Paul said. "This year
is different, and anything can
happen in the ECAC.

Wolverines down Cal, earn second victory

ByAZALEA HINOJOSA
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's
lacrosse team's second-ever
win came in an all-too-familiar
fashion. Saturday afternoon at
the Big House, the young team
rallied past
California, CALIFORNIA 12
thanks to a MICHIGAN 13
triumphant
double-overtime performance.
This victory marks the
second time the Wolverines
have snagged a game in double
overtime, the first coming
against UC Davis with an
identical 13-12 final score, but
Saturday marked the first. time
they outshot their opponent, a
35-30 advantage.
Freshman attacker Tess
Korten tallied four points,
garnering her third career hat
trick. She scored the game's first
goal less than four minutes into
the match.
With just 1:03 remaining
in double overtime, freshman
attacker Jess Angerman found
herself open in the middle of the
eight-meter arc and with a quick
pass from Korten, she lashed
the ball straight to the bottom
corner of the net.
"To have two home games
that we've won in overtime,
in a dramatic fashion, says a
lot about their character and
strength," said Michigan coach
Jennifer Ulehla.
The first half saw alot of back-
and-forth exchanges of points.
When California scored the next
two goals following Korten's,
the Wolverines answered with
a pair of their own, by freshman
midfielder Anna Schueler and
Angerman, respectively.
The Golden Bears notched
four more goals and Michigan
drilled in an additional two, one
by freshman midfielder Madeline
Dion and the second of Schueler's
four goals.
The Wolverines faced a 6-5
deficit by the end of the first half,
but Ulehla knew that her team
had more fight in them.
"Initially, I wasn't very happy
with our performance,"'Ulehla

Freshman Jess Angerman scored the game-winning goal with just 1:03 left in the second overtime, giving the Michigan women's lacrosse teamn

got Anna who's a threat from
the top."
The trio has been troubling
defenses all season, and it
was apparent more than ever
against the Golden Bears.
Angerman scored four goals
and had two assists, Korten
had a career-high seven points
- four goals and three assists
- and Schueler notched three
goals and one assist.
"We're at the point in the
season where everyone'sworking
well together," Angerman said.
The improved chemistry is
evident on the field. Schueler
and Angerman found room
running isolation plays from
the midfield, which forced
California to bring quick double
teams, leaving room on the
crease for Korten and other
attackmen. Korten's dodging
from behind the net forced
double teams as well and led to

said. "We didn't come out the
way I knew we could come out
against this team. At halftime,
I said to them 'The bad news is
that we just played a very bad 30
minutes. The good news is we're
only down one goal. We're going
to make some adjustments."'
The halftime talk proved to
be beneficial when freshman
attacker Kelly Schlansker scored
her first career goal one minute
into the second half.
The Wolverines indeed
adjusted and executed a new
game plan. Freshman goaltender
Allison Silber was noticeably
farther out from the goal than
usual in an effort to create more
pressure on the Golden Bears'
offense. Silber joined her defense
at times and succeeded in
creating crucial turnovers.
By the end of regulation play,
the score was knotted 11-11 and
the teams prepared for overtime,
which consisted of two three-
minute halves.
Overtime began on a negative

note for the Wolverines. Within
the minute, California scored
and maintained control of the
ball for the majority of the first
overtime half.
But after switching nets,
Michigan was hungry for a tying
goal. As the fight for ground balls
intensified and collisions became
a common occurrence, Korten
found Angerman for a game-
tying goal with a little less than
two minutes left.
Double overtime called for an
even bigger fight, though, as it
was now sudden death.
When Schueler's penalty shot
was disqualified by an early
whistle, the fans voiced their
outrage.
Her second chance at the
eight-meter mark wasn't
successful, bouncing off the
opposing goaltender.
But the Wolverines responded
to adversity and secured avictory.
"They're just growing every
single day and that's our goal,"
Ulehla said.

and doubles helped the Wolver-

Wisconsin, 6-1, to get within one
match of that goal.
Saturday, Michigan (7-0 Big

The Michigan lineup wasn't
broken, but coach Carol Hutchins
still wanted to fix it.
Hutchins
had moved NOTEBOOK
sophomore
left fielder Sierra Lawrence to
the cleanup slot for games on
Wednesday and Friday to fill in
for slumping senior firstbaseman
Caitlin Blanchard. But with
Blanchard returning to form
Friday and Lawrence looking
what Hutchins described as
"uncomfortable," the sophomore
was back in her usual place for
the final two games of the series
against Michigan State.
"I like to extend the order,"
Hutchins said. "Sometimes
getting moved around gets you
going."
That was exactly the result for
both Lawrence and Blanchard.
Lawrence hit a three-run homer
over the scoreboard inleft-center
field in the third inning Sunday
and followed it up with two more
RBI and two runs in a booming
seventh inning.
The Wolverines piled up 10
runs in that inning, including a
pinch-hit grand slam by junior
right-hander Sara Driesenga,
finishing off a 14-0 win.
TURNING TWO: Driesenga
was bailed out in each of the
first three innings Saturday by
timely double plays from her
defense.
Freshman second baseman
Abby Ramirez caught a sharp
liner and relayed a throw to
Blanchard in the first inning
after Driesenga gave up a
leadoff single, starting a series
of twin killings.
Blanchard recorded one
unassisted in the second,
and freshman third baseman
Lindsay Montemarano got

Driesenga out of a bases-loaded
jam in the third, showing off
her reflexes.
Montemarano fielded a well-
hit grounder, then threw home
to junior catcher Lauren Sweet,
who pegged the batter in the
back, getting her out by way of
runner interference.
Driesenga, who hasn't
allowed a run since March 21,
was able to recover from her
early jams and settle back in
to complete an 8-0 run-rule
victory in five innings.
"(Being bailed out by the
defense) was huge for my
confidence, and huge for the
team," Driesenga said. "It keeps
the momentum going our way."
MAKING THE CUT:
Wednesday, junior left-hander
Haylie Wagner and sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero
were named among the top 25
finalists for the USA Softball
Collegiate Player of the Year.
Romero is third in the nation
in batting average (.511), eighth
in slugging percentage (.879)
and leads the country with an
on-base percentage of .636.
Wagner gave up one run in
five innings in a 9-1 victory
Friday and closed out the
seventh inning Sunday to lower
her earned-run average to 0.95
and bump her record to 19-0
this season.
The two should be
co-favorites for the Big Ten
Player of the Year, but the
national honor may be out of
reach at this point in the season
because of the Wolverines'
weak schedule within the
conference.
Florida State's Maddie

percentage (.959), and Lacey

EAST LANSING - All
weekend, it seemed the
Michigan softball team had held
back. Two runs in one inning,
one run the next. The result was
two mercy victories, but the
runs never poured on.
Until the seventh inning of
the final game - the last chance
to erase all doubt.
In that frame, the Wolverines
(12-0 Big
Ten, 33-6 MICHIGAN ST. 1

home runs,
finishing MICHIGAN ST. 0
off a 14-0 MICHIGAN 14
victory at
Michigan State (2-12, 9-28) for
their 19th straight win.
The bats had been fairly
sluggish in the first six innings
Sunday, managing just three
runs on six hits. Sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero
went 1-for-3, and sophomore
outfielder Sierra Lawrence's
three-run homer in the third
inning represented the team's
only earned runs.
Four innings later, it was
Lawrence who got the ball
rolling once again, and it didn't
stop rolling until Michigan
State had nothing left.
"Our hits were feeding off,
each other, we were feeding off
each other's energy," Lawrence
said. "It was alot of fun."
After Lawrence's RBI single,
junior catcher Lauren Sweet
and freshman third baseman
Lindsay Montemarano hit back-
to-back home runs. Romero
followed four batters later with
a two-run single.
Then, with the bases loaded
and the game long since
decided, junior right-handed
pitcher Sara Driesenga stepped
up for her 21st at-bat of the
season. She drilled a grand slam

insult to injury.
"They were all loosened up
and swinging well," Hutchins
said. "It's good to see we know
the game is seven innings, not
five.
"We weren't in it the whole
game - early in the game, I
didn't think we were."
In one inning, the series finale
had gone from competitive
pitcher's duel to blowout. The
Wolverines won the series by
a total score of 31-1 - and it
wasn't their most lopsided Big
Ten series of the season.
After the game, Hutchins was
pleased with the seventh-inning
outburst because Michigan
played a complete game, which
hasn't happened much in the
past month.
While the bats took time
to get going, freshman right-
hander Megan Betsa kept the
lead comfortable with a six-

inning, four-hit shutout.
"I don't think I had my best
performance today, but it's
giving the best that I have, and
that's what I did," Betsa said.
"My defense was there to work
behind me."
For the second straight
weekend, the freshman got the
nod in the series finale. She
scattered seven baserunners
over six shutout innings,
lowering her season earned-run
average to1.89.
Betsa did, however, struggle
early for the third straight
weekend. After retiring the
first two batters, she gave up
a single to Michigan State
third baseman Sara Gutknecht
and walked designated player
Stephanie Sanders to bring
Hutchins out to the circle.
"She looks like she tries too
hard, or maybe she gets nervous
that the hitter is going to hit it,

I don't know," Hutchins said.
"But it's not sharp. Her change-
up is her best pitch, and it
bounces in too often for me."
But after that, she struck out
catcher Lindsey Besson and
retired nine of the next 10 as
well, finishing with a six-pitch,
1-2-3 fourth inning.
Betsa negated Michigan
State's strong defense and
pitching early in the game.
Senior outfielder Nicole
Sappingfield was thrown out
at home in the first, and senior
designated player Taylor
Hasselbach was robbed of a
home run at the right-field wall
in the second.
The Wolverines let Michigan
State hang around and play all

of the weekend.
But in the seventh, the
Wolverines kept piling on,

Martin's two hits Sunday, the
Michigan baseball team beat
Illinois, 4-2, to win the weekend
series, 2-1.
Martin's timely hitting, both
Saturday and Sunday, spelled
doom for the Fighting Illini.
Before the weekend, Martin
was hitting .205, but he upped
his average to .252 after tallying
six hits.
"(Martin) played like a senior
and a leader," said Michigan
coach Erik Bakich. "This was
his coming-out party offensively.
He was swinging the bat well
in practice and the hits weren't
falling for him earlier in the year."
Illinois (6-3 Big Ten, 18-13
overall) wasted no time getting
on the scoreboard, when David
Kerianripped aline drive to center
field, scoring Will Krug. The
center fielder hit a frozen rope to
right field on the game's first pitch
and used his speed to advance to
third on a fielder's choice.
Michigan, though, kept an
aggressive approach at the
plate. Sophomore shortstop
Travis Maezes lined a double
to deep left field and scored
on junior outfielder Jackson
Glines' sacrifice fly.
Michigan (6-6, 16-19-1) took
its momentum to the fifth inning,
when Maezes reached base on a
fielder's choice before stealing
second and third. Junior first
baseman Kyle Jusick knocked
Maezes home on a sacrifice fly to
take the lead, 2-1.
Fifth-year senior Logan
McAnallen took the mound for
the Wolverines, making his first

Big Ten start. The left-hander
pitched to contact early, and
he benefited from the strong
defensive play behind him.
McAnallen threw five innings
and allowed only one run.
"We weren't sure in the early
part of the game because he
was getting behind in counts,"
Bakich said. "But he battled
back and competed. He's one of
our tough guys, and we needed
to him to pitch tough - and he
pitched tough."
McAnallen also used a steady
pickoff move to keep the Illini
grounded on the base path. In
the fourth inning, the southpaw
picked off Reid Roper for the
first out of the inning.
McAnallen wasn't the only
Wolverine having success
picking off runners.
In the seventh inning,
freshman left-hander Brett
Adcock picked off the go-ahead
runner, and in the eighth,
sophomore right-hander Jacob
Cronenworth added a pickoff of
his own to end the frame.

Eric Jacob rounded out the
Wolverines' scoring when
Maezes doubled to left.

rhythm early on the hill and
closed out the game, earning his
seventh save.
"We took advantage of
some mistakes, which, in a
close game, are magnified,"
Bakich said. "We showed some
toughness in a lot of spots.
"When we needed our guys to
come through in big spots, our
guys came through in big spots -
in all facets of the game."

only one run but was tagged
