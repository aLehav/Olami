“I can say ‘I’m gay’ so easily 

now, but for the majority of 
my life those words held me 
hostage,” one performer said.

Public Policy junior Lena 

Dreves 
recently 
started 

approaching 
student 
groups 

and organizations for support 
to create a LGBTQ Monologues 
event 
happen, 
which 
was 

ultimately co-sponsored by the 
Spectrum Center and LGBT+ 
Michigan. Dreves wanted to 
bring to light the experiences of 
members of this community, and 
saw this come to fruition at the 
first annual event Wednesday 
night.

LGBTQ Monologues consisted 

of 11 student speakers detailing 
their experiences as members of 
the community and the different 
struggles they have faced. Dreves 
emphasized people need an 
outlet to express the range of 
emotions associated with coming 
out.

“Not 
only 
is 
this 
event 

beneficial for the people sharing, 
but for the people hearing, I 
think it really puts a face to the 
LGBT community,” Dreves said. 
“I think a lot of times we hear 
about statistics and everything’s 
institutionalized and political, 
especially around this topic 
today. I think by hearing stories, 
when people are reading these 
statistics 
they’re 
going 
to 

remember a face and a story.”

Speakers talked about the 

different intricacies associated 
with coming out, focusing on 
topics such as parental dynamics, 
acceptance 
and 
reconciling 

identity with faith. LSA senior 
Michael 
Miller-Perusse, 
who 

was a co-chair of the event and 
is the community outreach chair 
for LGBT+ Michigan, mentioned 
the importance of attending 
monologue events and holding 
supportive events for community 
members.

“We thought Coming Out 

Week would be a great time 
to 
do 
this,” 
Miller-Perusse 

said, referring to the week of 
Oct. 4 to Oct. 11. “I think it’s 
really beneficial for students to 
hear different people in their 
community 
with 
different 

backgrounds and life experiences 
and really listen to their story, 
as well as attend events held by 
people from communities I’m not 
a part of and learn more about 

their experiences.”

Public Policy junior Daniel 

Greene spoke about coming out 
and dealing with unexpected 
backlash after a Michigan Daily 
article about his experience 
as a gay man in Greek life ran 
the same day. He changed his 
monologue after the article was 
released.

by the catastrophic damage 
of 
Hurricane

The 

Category 4 hurricane, which 
struck the island on Sept. 
20, has created a total power 
outage across the nation and 
left only 20 percent of the 
island with water service. As of 
right now, seven percent of the 
island has power back and 47 
percent have access to potable 
water.

campus to provide students 
and faculty with direct access 
to donate until Oct. 12.

With the two Jewish High 

Holidays — Rosh Hashanah, the 
Jewish New Year, from Sept. 20 
to 22, and Yom Kippur, the Day 
of Atonement, from Sept. 29 to 
30 — only 10 days apart this year, 
Jewish University of Michigan 
students have been struggling 
to juggle academics and their 
religious 
responsibilities. 
The 

University’s long-standing policy 
regarding the religious holiday 
schedule is outlined on the Office 
of the Provost’s website; however, 
while many Jewish students are 
able to accordingly compromise 
with their professors to work 
around their religious schedules, 
some say they find their professors 
to be rather unaccommodating.

Public Policy professor Paul 

Courant, former interim provost, 
emailed the University’s religious 
holidays policy to faculty and 
staff in late August. The current 
policy states the University does 
not cancel classes for religious 
holidays but does require faculty 
and 
staff 
to 
work 
together 

in 
accommodating 
students’ 

academic 
needs

Wednesday afternoon, the 

University of Michigan settled 
its FOIA lawsuit with the 
Mackinac Center for Public 
Policy to release University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

personal 
emails 
from 
his 

University 
email 
account 

during and following the 2016 
presidential election.

Prior 
to 
the 
election, 

Schlissel’s 
concerns 
about 

Trump were prevalent, as the 
emails indicate.

“I realize that some may 

interpret this as anti-Trump 
although 
there 
is 
nothing 

explicit 
in 
the 
remarks,” 

Schlissel 
wrote 
to 
Lisa 

Rudgers, 
the 
University’s 

former vice president for global 
communications and strategic 

initiatives, on Aug. 24, 2016, 
discussing why his freshman 
convocation 
speech 
was 

planning to be heavily focused 
on the election. “I would 
feel awful if Trump won the 
election and I was too afraid of 
appearing political to make any 
effort to encourage our students 
to thoughtfully participate.” 

In one of the emails, Schissel 

remarked 
on 
conservative 

students’ feelings to Daniel 
Little, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan-Dearborn’s 
chancellor. 

“An 
(sic) 
also 
some 

compliants 
(sic) 
from 
our 

minority of Trump supporters 
who now feel marginalized and 
ostracized in our campus milleu 
(sic) and post election activity,” 
he wrote on Nov. 11. “Ironic.”

The emails later revealed 

Schlissel’s anxiety during the 
aftermath of Trump’s election, 
citing this as a pivotal moment 
of 
his 
term 
as 
University 

president.

Fallout from violent arrest due to miscommunication, concerns of police brutality

Hundreds 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 

residents 
marched 
Wednesday 

night from the Blake Transit Center 
to City Hall to protest last week’s 
violent arrest of Ciaeem Slaton, a 
Black 16-year-old who was waiting 
at the BTC for a bus home.

According 
to 
University 
of 

Michigan 
alum 
Anna 
Lemler, 

an organizer with local activist 
group Collective Against White 
Supremacy, the arresting officer 

was responding to reports of a fight 
that had occurred there earlier.

“It sounds like there was some 

high energy because of that fight 
and so he got there for a different 
reason, to take the bus home, and 
the cop said, ‘You need to leave,’” 
she said in an earlier interview. “So 
he started to walk away from the 
crowd and the cop came up and 
approached him again, and that’s 
when he asked for his ID.”

At that point, Slaton told the 

officer he didn’t have any ID because 
his school had not yet issued them. 
It is unclear if anything transpired 

in between, but the officer then 
proceeded to arrest Slaton, putting 
him face-down on the ground and 
pinning him with his knee. In the 
video, Slaton’s friends can be heard 
telling him not to move, and others 
saying, “F--- 12.”

Ahead of the march, DaQuann 

Harrison, a friend of Slaton’s who 
organized the rally, noted the 
historical context of police brutality 
against young Black men, and the 
history of police brutality in Ann 
Arbor.

“(Ciaeem) is one of many youth 

of color who are targeted by police 

in here. His situation is also one of 
many that has historically appeared 
here in Ann Arbor,” Harrison said. 
“And we cannot forget the many 
young Black people who have been 
brutalized around the country 
by police: Tamir Rice, Jordan 
Edwards, 
Oscar 
Grant, 
Mike 

Brown, Freddie Gray, just to name 
a few. And here in Ann Arbor, Aura 
Rosser, a Black woman shot and 
killed while in crisis by an AAPD 
officer.”

Arthur Brooks, president 

of the American Enterprise 
Institute, 
says 
there 
are 

several ways in which those 
in poverty can escape their 
situation. One of these ways is 
by living a “startup life.”

Brooks, who gave a talk 

Wednesday afternoon about 
escaping 
poverty 
through 

entrepreneurship as a part 
of the Policy Talks at the 
Ford School of Public Policy, 
said living a “startup life” 
includes 
taking 
risks 
and 

using weaknesses to propel 
strengths. He also discussed 
how those in positions of 
privilege can help those in 
poverty.

Brooks 
highlighted 
the 

Prison 
Entrepreneurship 

Program, 
an 
organization 

based in Houston, Texas, that 
works to educate and mentor 
men in prison on starting and 
running their own businesses.

“People 
walking 
around 

who 
can’t 
work, 
they’re 

literally the most vulnerable 
people in our society today,” 
Brooks said. “The reason the 
Prison 
Entrepreneurship 

Program exists is because 
they’re trying to find a way to 
solve this.”

Of the men who were took 

part in the program, only 7 
percent went back to jail in 
their first three years out, as 
opposed to 50 percent of those 
who were not a part of the 
program, according to Brooks.

Through 
the 
program, 

Brooks said, he realized what 
the incarcerated men were 
learning was changing their 
outlooks on life. Suddenly, 
they started talking about the 

things that were going right in 
their lives and living like an 
enterprise.

“I thought I was going to 

find the secret to startup 
businesses, and what I found 
was the secret to startup 
lives,” Brooks said. “See, when 
I talked to these guys, they 
didn’t want to talk about their 
businesses and the money they 
were making. They wanted to 
talk about all the things that 
were going right in their lives 
because they had learned 
about entrepreneurship.”

Public 
Health 
student 

Stuart 
Hammond 
came 

to 
the 
event 
because 
he 

wanted 
to 
get 
Brooks’s 

perspective on capital within 
entrepreneurship.

“I have experience working 

in pretty low-income settings 
and so I was interested in 
what he was going to say about 

the role of capital in having 
successful 
entrepreneurial 

experiences,” 
Hammond 

said. “The indirect way that 
he talked about it was he 
did talk about these people 
coming out of prison, they 
had time, and time itself 
is a resource that you can 
capitalize on.”

The men in the program 

implemented 
two 
things 

Brooks 
later 
recognized 

were part of people living 
“startup lives”: taking risks 
and using weaknesses to 
propel strengths.

Brooks 
cited 
a 
study 

done by Steven Levitt, an 
economist at the University 
of Chicago and the co-author 
of 
Freakonomics, 
which 

looked at participants facing 
a big decision. Levitt told the 
participants that he would 
make the decision for them 
through the flip of a coin, 
with heads being yes and 
tails being no.

Meeting on the first floor of 

the Michigan Union Wednesday 
night, speakers at the South 
Asian Awareness Network event 
discussed 
civic 
engagement, 

political 
issues 
and 
their 

personal experiences working in 
government.

Christine Stead, president of 

the Ann Arbor Public Schools 
Board, and Bobby McKenzie, 
director 
of 
the 
Muslim 

Diaspora 
Initiative, 
answered 

questions 
from 
community 

engagement 
chairs 
Subhan 

Chaudry, a Business sophomore, 
and 
Srinidhi 
Subramanian, 

an LSA senior. Chaudry and 
Subramanian 
moderated 
the 

event for an hour and then 
entered an open, unmoderated 
discussion with attendees. Three 
state representatives were also 
scheduled to attend but were 
unable to attend last minute. 

Stead discussed her years of 

experience working in the Ann 
Arbor 
Public 
Schools 
Board 

extensively. She said living in 
Ann Arbor has led her to become 

passionate about education in 
politics.

“It’s been a huge privilege 

for me to grow up in this town 
because education is important 
here, and that’s unique,” Stead 
said. “Education in general — it’s 
given me every opportunity that I 
have.”

Stead voiced her opposition to 

the work of Secretary of Education 
Betsy DeVos when she worked 
in 
Michigan 
on 
the 
Detroit 

charter school system, saying 
her school-choice system works 
well in theory but has led to the 
disenfranchisement of a number 
of students in the city. Stead also 
encouraged attendees to become 
involved in the political process 
in any way that they could. She 
identified the use of technology by 
young people as a new way to vote 
and participate. 

Stead was satisfied with the 

dialogue at the event and the role 
she and McKenzie played despite 
the absence of the other speakers.

“Between the two of us, we had 

some hopefully helpful tactical 
ideas around how to raise an 
issue and stay engaged and get 
to solutions,” Stead said. “These 
things unfortunately do take time, 
and they also take lots of people to 

kind of create momentum. But I’m 
hoping people heard something 
that is useful and constructive.”

McKenzie 
spoke 
on 
his 

experience 
as 
the 
head 
of 

the MDI and working with 
legislators on local, state and 
national scales. He recounted his 
experiences working with hard-
right 
Republican 
congressmen 

and his ability to pesuade them 
to work with him. Despite being 
a Democrat, he said, using data 
and objective explanations of the 
problems the MDI faces helped to 
bridge the political gap.

He said a major problem with the 

American political environment 
is that politicians are forced to 
pander to their bases instead of 
working constructively across the 
aisle. He praised the skills and 
competence of elected officials, 
but he also expressed frustration 
with the political requirements of 
the system and what he views as 
the limits it places on progress.

Chaudry said this event is the 

first of its kind for SAAN. He said 
the organization is now able to 
help students effect change on 
campus and that that has become 
a goal for the leadership.

“All we’ve ever focused on is 

awareness and knowledge and 

getting that out, but we’ve never 
really gone into the activism area,” 
Chaudry said. “And that was a big 
thing for us: How do we get people 
energized? How do we help them 
in achieving these goals? Because 
yeah, we can teach them all about 
these issues and show them what’s 
wrong. But in the end, if we don’t 
do anything about it, there’s no 
solution.”

LSA senior Sahr Yazdani, a 

board member for SAAN and part 
of the marketing team, expressed 
a similar excitement about the 
evolving role of the organization 
and this event.

“Events like these are really 

important because they remind 
students of their ability to make 
change and to catalyze something 
that could actually be productive 
for people in the future,” Yazdani 
said.

Stead and McKenzie answered 

several questions about student 
activism on the University of 
Michigan campus specifically and 
said persistence is key for any kind 
of advocacy. After the event, Stead 
expressed her optimism in the 
face of ongoing challenges and her 
confidence in student activists.

White girls sure love tofu.
They put it in quinoa bowls, in almond 

bowls and in Buddha bowls (a concept 
which I don’t understand — but that’s for 
another time), on their Instagram feeds 
topped off with a rustic-chic filter. It’s 
one of the new health guru staples — 
throw some tofu in, it’ll change your life. 
It’s so healthy, so simple, it’s amazing, 
it’s to die for.

I, too, love tofu. My mother used to fry 

it for me with green onions, thick slices 
with a crispy skin over rice. Or she’d 
put it in a fish soup, and I’d spend ten 
minutes carefully clearing the premises 
of any bones or eyeballs before eating it. 
When we went to dim sum restaurants, 
I’d order the mapo tofu, with black chilli 
peppers, so spicy that I could feel it 
coating my tongue.

White girls didn’t want my tofu back 

then.

The right to cook a cuisine that is 

not your own is still incredibly messy. 
From obscure health bloggers to high-
profile chefs like Andy Ricker, a white 
man from Oregon hailed as a “Thai-
cooking superstar”, white people making 
Asian food is a very touchy subject. And 
although the arguments are true that 
yes, white people can study a cuisine 
extensively, and white culture is based 
in cultural appropriation, the question 
is not of whether they can cook it well 
or not, because cultural appropriation is 
rooted much deeper than the food itself. 
Just as Sarah Bond pointed out in an 
article for Forbes, food has been used as 
a tool to show status dating back to the 

Roman Empire, distinguishing between 
the 
‘sophisticated’ 
and 
‘barbarian’ 

people. When white girls pointed out 
my weird homemade lunch in the first 
grade, it certainly felt that way. So to 
see it now being lauded as the big new 
trend by white people does not sit right. 
One blogger I saw had posted a picture 
of their tofu and grain bowl, talking 
about how special “Asian cuisine” was 
to them. But what even is Asian cuisine 
to them? Because to me, Filipino food is 

incredibly different from Indian food, 
which is different from Japanese food, 
which is different from Chinese food. 
Not even accounting for the fact that 
within China, Shanghainese food and 
Sichuan food are on two completely 
unrelated palates. One cuisine might 
be influenced from the other, and there 
might be overlap, but each one brings a 
distinct character to the table. You can’t 

throw tofu in a bowl and expect all Asian 
people to believe it’s theirs.

That’s just the problem with white 

people making so-called “ethnic” foods. 
So much room opens up for mislabeling 
and shallowness, and more importantly, 
the undermining of a community for 
profit. A white person can make money 
off another cuisine, while simultaneously 
squashing another opportunity for the 
community itself to be represented, and 
demonstrating a lackluster, insensitive 
approach to actually uplifting the people 
they are profiting off. Cultural exchange 
is important and has given us many of 
the cuisines we enjoy today; but cultural 
exchange 
is 
not 
synonymous 
with 

oppression, and past oppression seems 
to have justified today’s appropriation. 
I’m no food expert, but I do know the 
sting of people cherry-picking from my 
culture, taking out the tofu and Chinese 
characters 
and 
silk 
jackets, 
while 

reinforcing the ideas that my history is 
unimportant, my eyes are ugly and my 
community is doing fine even when it’s 
not. 

The truth is, I want to share my food 

with white people. I want them to learn 
more about my community, and I want 
to fuse cuisines to make even more 
delicious tofu (I hope I have established 
by now that I really like tofu). But 
exchange becomes hard when you know 
your community has been exploited 
throughout history, your culture taken 
apart and picked over at the ease of a 
larger systematic oppressor. Bottom line: 
don’t. White people might throw their 
hands up and say, “If you want to share 
with us, why don’t you just reach across 
the aisle more?” But I’ve been reaching, 
and it’s a labor that’s been one-sided. 
And so far in return, I’ve received bland 
tofu with Instagram filters, and Andy 
Ricker. And I’m tired.

Anyone who has ever met me knows 

that asking about my racial and ethnic 
identity is the quickest way to confuse me. 
But there is one particular question that 
perpetually haunts me: Am I Asian? The 
answer: maybe? I find myself selectively 
identifying as Asian American. Sometimes 
it just depends on the day. Other times, it’s 
based on whom I’m with. Most often, I’m 
not just Asian American but I’m South 
Asian American; the South is key. Looking 
back, I’ve realized that throughout my 
life, the fluctuations in how I’ve identified 
as Asian American have been heavily 
influenced by various Asian-American 
peers, particularly East Asian Americans.

I definitely did not start identifying 

as Asian American until I was in middle 
school. 
The 
Asian-American 
student 

population at my middle school was equal 
parts East and Southeast Asian American; 
I was one of the few South Asian-
American students there. I remember 
asking my friends if they thought I was 
Asian American and they immediately 
responded with “Yeah, of course. What 
other continent are India and Sri Lanka 
in?” This reassured me that I was 
undoubtedly Asian American; what else 
could I be?

That changed in high school. At my 

high school, the Asian-American student 
population was mostly composed of East 
Asians, and there were fewer South Asian, 
Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander 
Americans there. Many of my Asian-
American and white peers would say, “No 
way you’re Asian, like you’re not Chinese” 
or “Being Indian isn’t the same as being 

Asian.” My experiences in high school 
taught me that here in America, Asian is 
equated with East Asian.

What is interesting is that when I asked 

my parents whether I was Asian, they 
were surprised that I did not already 
know the answer. My parents spent much 
of their lives living in England. They 
have told me on multiple occasions that 
based on their experiences, in England 
the Asian identity is equivalent to being 
South Asian. It took them quite a while 
to recognize that here Asian is equated 
with East Asian. This showed me just how 
relative and subjective (and let’s not forget 
confusing) the Asian identity can be.

Many large Asian-American student 

organizations, including Uncover: A/
PIA and the United Asian American 
Organizations, have pushed for more 
diversity, inclusivity and representation 
of the Asian-American identity. More 
often than not, I tend to identify as 
Asian American within these spaces. 
Despite this, there are still quite a few 
student organizations that claim to be 
pan-Asian American but have little to no 
representation of South Asian Americans, 
Southeast Asian Americans or Pacific 
Islander Americans. Also, when I am with 
individual Asian Americans or smaller 
friend groups of Asian Americans, I don’t 
really feel Asian American. I’ve come 
across comments from my East Asian-
American peers that include “You’re not 
Asian. You’re different” and “But, like, 
Asians, like, you know what I mean.” To 
be honest, no I don’t. I genuinely have no 
idea what you mean.

I’ve basically lived all 21 years of my life 

as an American-Born Confused Desi (even 
though I was technically born in Canada), 
but now I’m also an equally confused, 

maybe fake Asian American as well? Yikes.

Disclaimer: My experiences in (self-

) identifying as an Asian American or 
people dictating whether I am Asian 
American have been neither positive nor 
negative experiences for me. They just 
happen. I’ve always been curious and 
perplexed about how the Asian-American 
identity seems to be extremely relative, 
flexible and subjective.

With that in mind, here are some 

questions that I often find myself thinking 
about:

1. What does it mean to be Asian or 

Asian American?

2. What does it mean to be a real Asian 

American versus a fake Asian American?

3. If there is no singular Asian-

American 
experience, 
why 
is 
Asian 

American tantamount to East Asian 
American?

4. Why do Asian Americans who 

are not of East Asian descent often find 
themselves having to justify or qualify 
their identity with a prefix?

5. Why do people not want the Asian-

American identity to be as diverse and 
inclusive as possible?

I’m not sure that I know, or ever will 

know, the answers to any of those questions. 
However, I think it’s important for Asian 
Americans to have conversations about 
these kinds of questions. And while I’m 
not sure I will ever be wholly comfortable 
identifying as Asian American, only time 
(and maybe the opinions of other Asian 
Americans) will tell.

Schrödinger’s Asian: Defining my identity

We’re tired of this

You shoot me with a gun,

I didn’t do anything

But yet you still run.

Silent judgement

You pass upon me and mine

Because the color of my skin,

So bronzed and full of shine.

My fellow people say

You make us seem less,

Beating us up, pulling our hair,

“Oh it’s such a mess.”

The way my lips 

Are full and round,

The way my hips sway 

As I walk over dreaded ground.

You want me to respect you

No matter what you do to me.

You want me to agree with you,

“Mexicans have no right to be

Here” when you know 

As much as I,

What only should be heard 

Are Native cries.

Don’t look at me

With a scowl on your face.

Look at me,

As I belong in this place.

“Cultural exchange

given us many of the 

cuisines we enjoy today; 
but cultural exchange 
is not synonymous with 

oppression”

religious obligations.

“Faculty are expected to provide 

reasonable 
accommodations, 

if 
possible, 
when 
religious 

observances cause a student to 
miss classes, examinations or 
other 
assignments,” 
Courant 

wrote.

However, 
despite 
the 

University’s steadfast policy, some 
students do not always have an 
accommodating experience with 
their professors.

LSA sophomore Madison, who 

requested her last name remain 
anonymous to avoid academic 
repercussion, had trouble with a 
professor she emailed a week in 
advance of Rosh Hashanah about 
missing a lab. Though her graduate 
student instructor assured her 
she would have a chance to make 
up any missed work, the course 
coordinator’s strict policies made 
it difficult to reschedule the 
lab. According to Madison, the 
syllabus stated students must 
email the coordinator three weeks 
in advance, but students did not 

receive the course coordinator’s 
email until the second week. Rosh 
Hashanah took place during the 
third week of school.

The coordinator’s policy does 

not align with the University’s 
religious holiday policy, which 
states students must give notice 
of class conflicts by the add/drop 
deadline for the term on Sept. 25.

Madison said she sent an email 

a week in advance only to receive a 
reply from her course coordinator 
a day before the holiday that 
stated her request could not be 
accommodated because she did 
not give the coordinator enough 
time to reschedule.

This situation would seem to 

violate the University’s policy.

“Faculty should make every 

effort 
to 
avoid 
scheduling 

required work that is difficult 
to reschedule, e.g., lab, exams 
or 
high-profile 
non-classroom 

activities, on religious holidays,” 
Courant wrote.

As a result, Madison’s lab was 

counted as an excused absence 
on the condition that she could 
not miss another lab for a Jewish 
holiday or for any illness, since she 
used up her one excused absence.

“I was so upset. She was putting 

so much pressure on me that I 
almost went to lab instead of going 
to services at Hillel and observing 
the holiday because I was so 
worried I would be sick one day 
in the future and be penalized,” 
Madison said.

She also feared the situation 

would affect her overall grade in 
the course as a result of earning 
fewer points in the lab she was 
absent from. 

“I was afraid that I would not 

get as good of a grade in the class 
as I would if the total points were 
higher and I am still not sure how 
that will affect my grade yet,” 
Madison said.

However, LSA senior Elana 

Rosenthal has found most of her 
teachers to be respectful of her 
religious observances. In advance 
of the holidays, she has always sent 
emails to her GSIs and professors 
that outlined the specific dates she 
will need to miss class. She has 
never had a problem with having 
her absences excused or getting 
extensions for assignments.

“T

hat’s incredible. I 
wish I could be there 
alongside him right 

now,” I thought as I 
clicked the like button 
on the article detailing 
University of Michigan 
student Dana Greene’s 
protest 
against 

racism on the Diag. 
I 
closed 
Facebook 

and continued typing 
away at the paper due 
in class the next day, 
sitting 
comfortably 

on my bed. My paper 
had a long way to go; 
protests would have to wait. 

Looking back at this moment, 

my excuse didn’t hold up. I could 
have stopped by the Diag multiple 
times that day, but I didn’t. And 
besides, was a grade really more 
important than demonstrating 
against the racism students of 
color face all too frequently on 
this campus? I consider myself an 
ally in the fight against racism, but 
what is allyship without action?

I’m far from the first white ally 

who’s given into complacency. 
White people have been telling 
Black people to wait for a more 
convenient time for their rights 
as long as the movement for Black 
rights has existed. In 1963, Martin 
Luther King Jr. lamented not 
about the “Ku Klux Klanner, but 
the white moderate, who is more 
devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; 
who prefers a negative peace 
which is the absence of tension 
to a positive peace which is the 
presence of justice.”

The white moderate is Thomas 

Jefferson 
“paternalistically 

(believing) he can set the timetable 
for another man’s freedom,” as 
King wrote referring to when 
Jefferson called slavery a “moral 
depravity” but continued to profit 
from forced labor. The white 
moderate is President Eisenhower 
publicly condemning racism, but 
showing hesitation to enforce 
Brown v. Board of Education 
because 
“you 
cannot 
change 

people’s hearts merely by laws.” 
The white moderate is 96 percent 
of white Americans disapproving 
of the Ku Klux Klan but only 35 
percent expressing support for 
Black Lives Matter, a group known 
for large and disruptive protests 
against police brutality. A number 
of staunch conservatives have 

condemned the group as violent 
and hateful.

National divisions over Black 

activists’ 
protests 

of 
police 
brutality 

exemplify how white 
moderates can impede 
racial 
progress. 
In 

2014, Black activists 
organized large street 
demonstrations 
in 

Ferguson, 
Mo., 
to 

protest 
the 
police 

shooting of Michael 
Brown. A New York 
Times poll indicated 
67 percent of whites 

believed the protesters’ actions 
went too far.

I’m going to assume most 

of these white respondents 
believe 
police 
brutality 
is 

harmful 
and 
Black 
people 

have a right to demonstrate 
against it. So is it the perceived 
violence of Black Lives Matter 
that taints white public opinion 
of protests? The fact that up 
to 43 percent of white people 
believe NFL players should be 
fired for taking a knee — an 
inarguably 
peaceful 
protest 

— during the national anthem 
suggests not. No matter the 
form, some white people will 
always 
express 
disapproval 

when Black people publicly 
demand just treatment.

If 
white 
people 
are 
to 

effectively combat racism, we 
must shift our understanding of 
white supremacy from long white 
hoods to the day-to-day behaviors 
of ourselves and those close to 
us. White supremacy is not an 
abstract concept, far removed 
from daily action. It is nurtured in 
the everyday actions and inactions 
of white people. When a hiring 
manager skips past a resume 
with a “funny name,” when a jury 
indicts a Black youth for a crime a 
white teenager would never have 
been charged with, when a family 
stays silent during an uncle’s rant 
against “those people,” racism 
flourishes.

These 
subtle 
yet 
insidious 

behaviors act as tacit endorsements 
of systematic racism, whether 
intentional or not. Even the most 
well-meaning allies can fall into 
the trap of staying silent in the 
face of racism because they want 
to avoid conflict or discomfort. 
Racism is uncomfortable; white 

privilege is the ability to ignore 
that discomfort because it doesn’t 
affect you. 

Dismantling racism requires 

embracing discomfort. It requires 
calling out racist comments from 
friends and family. It requires 
joining protests and listening to 
the grievances of people of color. 
It requires being active and being 
present.

To 
defeat 
racism, 
white 

people must raise their voices 
against racism as often as people 
of color do. White people built 
and 
benefit 
from 
systematic 

racism. Therefore, the system 
cannot be dismantled without 
us. We can’t stand silently on the 
sidelines in situations of injustice 
while people of color protest 
discrimination. We must show 
up and support Black voices when 
they bring attention to police 
brutality, 
mass 
incarceration, 

voter suppression or any of the 
other symptoms of racism. As the 
NFL police brutality protests and 
Dr. King’s writings show, people 
will attempt to delegitimize Black 
activists no matter how peaceful 
or small their protests. These 
voices must be counteracted with 
cries of affirmation and support 
from white allies.

I’m not saying a white person 

has to attend every single Black 
Lives Matter protest to effectively 
combat racism. Activism is often 
a day-to-day, small-scale effort. 
One small step allies can take is 
speaking up when we hear racist 
language. It’s easiest to be racist in 
white-only spaces where no faces 
of color exist to remind someone 
of the consequences of their hate. 
Considering that according to a 
2013 survey, 75 percent of whites 
in the United States don’t have a 
single friend of color, these spaces 
are all too common. Therefore, 
white allies must hold our friends 
and families accountable. 

We must call out those around 

us who abuse the “N-word” 
or slip on the cloak of casual 
racism when they feel safe in 
their whiteness. It’s on us to 
dismantle racism’s safe spaces. 
As Desmond Tutu once said, “If 
you are neutral in situations of 
injustice, you have chosen the 
side of the oppressor.”

I 

hate sports.

I have absolutely no interest 

in any team, franchise, game 

or athlete.

My 
lack 
of 

care 
immediately 

disqualifies 
me 

from 95 percent of 
all 
conversations 

occurring 
within 

reach of a bottle of 
Budweiser, as men 
are horrified at my 
utter neglect over 
the statistics of the 
most recent game of 
the home concussions versus 
the away concussions.

Yet, though I don’t care for 

sports, I do care for politics.

And I don’t just care — I 

know politics like a Vegas 
bookie knows sports.

So when the two worlds 

collided last week due to our 
commander-in-tweet pandering 
to his base condemning the 
protests in the NFL, the political 
world I follow brought forth 
ample historical evidence about 
how protests have been utilized in 
the past within American sports. 
More specifically, these sports 
have become a righteous platform 
for marginalized Black athletes to 
voice their objections to a country 
that preaches equality. 

Several 
pieces 
written 

these 
past 
few 
weeks 

conveyed 
these 
ideas, 
and 

NPR’s Domenico Montanaro 
wrote a particularly excellent 
article that demonstrated the 
“complicated history of black 
athletes protesting in sports.”

In 
the 
Olympic 
Games, 

Black 
athletes 
have 
won 

countless medals for a country 
that divides, segregates and 
marginalizes 
them. 
From 

Jesse Owens in Nazi Germany 
to John Carlos and Tommie 
Smith in Mexico City, Black 
athletes have competed and 
succeeded 
for 
the 
United 

States despite the blatantly 
racist institutions that exist in 
the homeland.

And in 1968, when 

Smith 
and 
Carlos 

donned black gloves 
and raised their fists 
in 
a 
Black 
Power 

salute throughout the 
entirety of the national 
anthem, they did so to 
a United States caught 
in the grips of racial 
and social chaos.

As 
Montanaro 

wrote, 
“1968 
was 

another inflection point year in 
American political and social 
history. Violence was spilling 
out in the civil rights and 
integration movement. Cities 
had been burned from rioting 
the year before. Martin Luther 
King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy 
had been assassinated.”

And 
that 
was 
how 
they 

could respond: capturing white 
America’s attention.

That was how they could 

utilize the success of their 
athleticism 
to 
move 
the 

indifferent and tepid white 
American population into an 
uncomfortable 
conversation 

on race.

Yet, naturally, the two athletes 

faced an overwhelming amount 
of criticism and condemnation for 
such an act. They were stripped of 
their gold medals and condemned 
for their disrespect to our country.

Or take Muhammad Ali and 

his refusal to be drafted into a war 
he and millions of others morally 
objected to (and rightly so). His 
defiance to the draft landed him 
a sentence of five years in prison, 
yet he was unwavering about 
being sent to fight and kill the 
Vietnamese: “And shoot them for 
what? They never called me n-----, 
they never lynched me, they didn’t 
put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob 
me of my nationality, rape and kill 
my mother and father. … Shoot 

them for what? How can I shoot 
them poor people? Just take me 
to jail.” The Supreme Court later 
overturned Ali’s conviction, and 
he never served time.

And now, within the NFL, acts 

of protest face an overwhelming 
amount 
of 
chauvinistic 

condemnation due to the near-
satirical amount of patriotism 
displayed at our football games 
(we fly military aircraft over our 
stadiums). The vilification of 
these protesters comes from the 
ignorant and unsympathetic who 
lack the understanding that what 
these athletes are protesting has 
nothing to do with a piece of cloth.

Athletic success is an extremely 

effective platform for protest. 
I have often looked at sports 
as something nearly free from 
political 
discourse, 
which 
I 

thought justified my lack of 
interest. But I forget I come 
from a position of privilege and 
ignorance, living my comfortable 
life unaware of Black athletes’ 
effective protests in the past. 
These athletes were offered an 
audience politicians could only 
dream of. They were revered 
and idolized for athletic ability, 
granting them the eyes and ears 
of millions.

Perhaps 
our 
president 
is 

calculating, and utilizing his 
outrage over this issue to mask the 
other glaring problems plaguing 
his administration. (Hey, Jared, 
cute email server, and, Tom Price, 
nice government jet you got there.)

Or maybe, just maybe, he’s an 

impulsive old racist who panders 
to a base that worships a piece of 
cloth while disregarding the very 
intangible rights it represents.

I may hate sports, but I now 

realize 
it’s 
another 
platform 

that can be used to address the 
problems that continue to infect 
our country.

I

t’s just past sundown and, 
after failing to make it over 
to Trader Joe’s on East 

Stadium 
Boulevard 

for the past two and 
a 
half 
weeks, 
I’m 

overwhelmed by the 
snacking possibilities 
awaiting me in my 
parents’ pantry. Upon 
any given arrival to my 
childhood home, the 
first stop is always the 
kitchen. Today is no 
exception. My phone 
buzzes as I’m halfway 
through my third breakfast biscuit. 
My relatives want to know whether 
I’m fasting today. 

If it weren’t for that text, I 

would’ve completely forgotten it 
was Yom Kippur.

Yom Kippur, or The Day of 

Atonement, is the holiest day of the 
year in Judaism. Following Rosh 
Hashanah by 10 days, the holiday 
is typically observed through 
participation in intensive prayer 
and sundown-to-sundown fasting. 
It is said that, after Yom Kippur, 
God has officially solidified his 
inscriptions in the Book of Life. 
According 
to 
Judaism, 
these 

inscriptions dictate who will or 
will not stick around for another 
earthly year. So yeah, the premise 
of Yom Kippur seems pretty high 
stakes: Repent or bust.

I 
say 
this 
light-heartedly 

because I have a relatively weak 
relationship with religion. This 
wasn’t always the case. I remember 
lying in bed as a child, praying 
to a compartmentalized image 
of God — a man in the sky with a 
nightcap and grizzly white beard. 
Sometime around age 16, my 
mental picture of an all-powerful 
Albus Dumbledore lookalike no 
longer made sense to me. I stopped 
practicing religion and have only 
recently started to re-evaluate this 
decision. There seemed to be ways 
to connect with religion on a more 
individualized basis than I had 
formerly acknowledged through a 
narrow and standardized Judeo-
Christian lens.

Though the apathetic high-

school-atheist phase does not grace 
the life of every American teenager, 
it seems a growing theme among the 
country’s Judeo-Christian youth. 
Teenage years are characterized 
by 
an 
increased 
desire 
for 

autonomy, a rebellious sensation 
likely limited by strict loyalty to 

Mom and Dad’s religious roots. 
Preservation of religious routine 
proves itself especially difficult 

on a largely secular 
college campus, where 
quantitative 
grade 

point 
averages 
and 

median exam scores 
feel exponentially more 
urgent than the pursuit 
of a spiritual outlet. 

As a former member 

of that demographic 
of 
apathetic 
and 

nonreligious 
youth, 

I’ll speak to my own 

experience: There were other 
things I wanted to do on Friday 
nights besides attend Shabbat 
services at the synagogue. It was as 
simple as that. I didn’t see the place 
for a system of belief in a busier 
life schedule, so I abandoned it 
altogether.

A 
return 
to 
religion 
can 

follow 
any 
combination 
of 

transformational life events — 
the death of a loved one, a bout 
of intense depression, a period 
of 
extreme 
turbulence 
and 

uncertainty. In many cases, the 
search for a new belief system may 
not be as much of a return as it is a 
reconstruction.

My 
religious 
base 
from 

childhood makes the return to a 
set of beliefs highly accessible to 
me. Accompanied by this desired 
return is the knowledge that I need 
to entirely recalibrate this base 
in organized religion by way of 
my own discretion. The said base 
holds many valuable teachings, 
and it is my current project to 
decide which of those teachings 
I find particularly applicable and 
worthwhile.

Reconstruction of faith can 

adopt 
many 
different 
forms. 

Maybe it’s a strong adherence to 
the communal aspect of religion, 
the attendance of services and 
prayer 
circles 
alongside 
like-

minded folk. Maybe it’s a learning 
process, the research of religious 
philosophies and subsequent use 
of that information to navigate 
the physical world in a sensible 
manner. I mean, talk about a 
rich text — religious scriptures 
and philosophies are endlessly 
fascinating to read with a more 
critical modern eye. Maybe it’s 
silent and completely personal, 
the revived yet revalued utterance 
of prayers retained from youth, 
a communication with a newly 

assessed concept of divine force.

In addition to emphasizing 

the metaphysical aspects of an 
otherwise tactile daily routine, 
religious adherence of some variety 
has proven itself widely beneficial 
in relation to mental health and 
wellness. 
Comparatively 
low-

stress levels have been recorded 
in 
religious 
or 
semi-religious 

individuals, as well as a stronger 
sense of purpose and meaning. 
Though this could be rooted to 
the existential notion of place in a 
higher order, the participatory and 
social aspects of religion appear 
the most strongly correlated to 
these statistics.

The participatory aspect of 

religion has specifically occupied 
my attention as I’ve started to 
tentatively consider belief a part 
of my life again. Participation in 
traditional practices gives me this 
feeling of meaningful contribution 
to a heritage that has undoubtedly 
shaped me in ways I may not fully 
realize. Determining whether to 
preserve particular traditions on 
an individual basis has become, for 
me, a helpful way to navigate the 
otherwise passive acquisition of a 
Jewish heritage.

Though I don’t foresee a 

strictly 
regimented 
religious 

practice in my near future, I hope 
to continue that participation 
in 
smaller 
acknowledgments 

of belief. I proceeded to fast on 
Yom Kippur after receiving my 
family’s post-sundown reminder 
with 
a 
mouthful 
of 
biscuit 

crumbs, and the cup of coffee I 
had on that Saturday morning 
didn’t technically align with the 
holiday’s 
fasting 
expectations 

either. I broke the rules a little bit, 
and that’s OK.

For the first time in years, 

I took part in a tradition that 
made me feel like a contributing 
member to the preservation 
of a deeply rooted religious 
philosophy. I took into account 
my own expectations for myself 
on this day instead of focusing 
solely on the standardized rules 
that I’d worked so hard to reject 
as a teenager. An otherwise 
mundane Saturday adopted a 
new meaning, drawn from an old 
religious base and shaped into 
something currently applicable 
and consciously chosen.

Paul McCartney gives live 
music newfound meaning

LAURA DZUBAY

Daily Arts Writer

My ideal concert venue is an 

abandoned barn.

Hear me out: It’s surrounded 

by empty fields, all quiet and 
attentive to themselves. It’s dark, 
but not frightening: you feel 
welcome, you’ve only stopped 
here for the night. The roof is 
patchy, the windows and doors 
open to the night air, the sky 
wild and soft. A single ukulele is 
strumming lightly, and all around 
the countryside, the stars turn 
and drizzle like rain.

The thing is, I didn’t even 

know this was my ideal concert 
venue until last night. I know now 
because I experienced it — that 
same barn, that same soft night — 
inside a stadium full of thousands 
of people. The countryside was 
in the middle of Detroit, and the 
person strumming the ukulele 
was Paul McCartney.

This sounds cheesy, so I’ll 

backpedal a little. This was my 
second time seeing McCartney 
live. Walking into the venues 
(which are almost invariably 
enormous), it’s not hard to get a 
sense that the concert has already 
started. Even if the lights are still 
on and the artist is nowhere to 
be seen, the other aspects that 
give the concert value — the 
hype, the variety, the feeling 
of togetherness — are already 
present. 
Fans 
mill 
around, 

buying 
drinks, 
finding 
their 

seats. Some of them are elderly, 
some are teenagers and children. 
Many 
wear 
shirts 
declaring 

their 
primary 
allegiances 
— 

The Beatles, Wings, even solo 
McCartney.

And 
everyone, 
it 
seems 

through my rose-colored glasses, 
is excited. Everyone is smiling. 
The stranger in the seat next to 
mine tells me he’s never seen 
McCartney before, but he can’t 
wait, he’s wanted this for so many 
years.

When McCartney comes out, 

he does it with a bang. He waves 
hello, and from his open-faced 
smile, you’d never know he’d 
played this exact same venue the 
night before. You’d never know 
that none of this was strange 
to him — at least, one wouldn’t 
expect for it to be. He slams 
the opening chord of “A Hard 
Day’s Night,” a chord that sends 
everyone in the stadium into 
instant cheers, and then he’s off. 
We’re all off.

It quickly becomes clear that it 

wasn’t just the opening song — the 
entire concert is going to happen 
with a bang. He reels through 
fast-paced rockers like “Save Us,” 
“I’ve Got a Feeling” and “Drive 
My Car,” and classic seventies-
guitar songs like “Letting Go” 
and “Let Me Roll It.” He launches 
from the middle of “A Day in the 
Life” straight into the refrain of 
“Give Peace a Chance.” Stagelight 
explores the far reaches of the 
stadium, showering us in colors 
that seem to shift with every 
minute. Balls of fire and literal 
fireworks explode onto the stage 
multiple times during the chorus 
of “Live and Let Die.” Later, when 
he sprints back out for an encore, 
confetti bursts from cannons, 
and McCartney and the other 
musicians run across the stage 
with giant flags rippling behind 
them (American, Union Jack 
and rainbow). When the show 
is finally over, he disappears 
magician-style 
behind 
white 

clouds of smoke and confetti that 
will probably take at least half an 
hour to disappear from the stage.

The special effect that remains 

throughout the entire show is the 
screen behind the stage. Every 
song is complemented by some 
sort of visual counterpart. There 
are reanimated photographs of 
Wings members during “Band 
on the Run,” and of himself and 
his baby daughter when he sings 
“Maybe I’m Amazed” in honor 
of the late Linda McCartney. 
A montage-style video plays in 
the background while he slams 
through “Lady Madonna” on the 
piano, showing photographs and 
footage of working women and 
mothers, all over the world and 
from all different time periods, 
dancing in unison, sprinting 
across finish lines.

It’s maybe a third of the way 

through the concert when the 
old barn assembles itself on the 
screen. The stars prop themselves 
up one by one around the stadium 
as people turn on the flashlights 
on their phones and lift them 
high. They’re closer than real 
stars — tangible, the kind you 
might actually risk a wish on. 
McCartney tells us a story about 
how he and The Quarrymen 
recorded this song on their first 
demo ever, and then he and his 
fellow musicians play “In Spite of 
All the Danger,” with harmonies 
so fine-tuned you wouldn’t think 
they were live, or coming from 
live people. It’s a perfect moment 
and it feels as though he’s singing 
with all of us, as individuals.

There are plenty of loaded 

moments 
throughout 
the 

concert, which is three hours 
long and practically nonstop. 
There are the tributes to George 
Martin (“Love Me Do”), George 
Harrison 
(“Something”) 
and, 

of course, John Lennon (“Here 
Today”), which comes along 
with a word of advice from Paul 
to never wait to tell people you 
love them, even if it feels silly, 
because you never know when 
it might be too late. There’s the 
performance 
of 
“Blackbird,” 

during which a platform slowly 
raises McCartney up and digital 
flowers appear blooming on the 
new wall beneath him. There’s 
“Hey Jude,” the last song before 
the encore, which has the entire 
stadium on our feet and singing 
in total unison. He even brings 
people up on stage: a father with 
a daughter who gets her arm 
signed by McCartney, and two 
excited fans here all the way from 
Japan.

But later, when I bring myself 

back to the present and look back, 
the moment that has lasted with 
me the most is the barn, with 
the stars of strangers lighting up 
all around. Maybe it’s because 
I grew up in the Midwest, 
driving through empty fields 
and exploring old buildings and 
making haphazard wishes. If you 
ask someone else who went to 
the same show, they’ll probably 
have found home in a different 
moment: maybe the pumping 
singalong of “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-
Da,” or the hardcore metal of 
“Helter Skelter,” or the Abbey 
Road medley that closed out the 
encore.

But I think that’s one of the 

things that makes McCartney’s 
concerts so special: He wants 
you to find a home in his work. 
He’s one of the most famous and 
enduring popular musicians of all 
time; he could probably charge 
the same amount of money for a 
shorter concert with half as many 
special effects. But he wants you 
to find something that really 
lands with you — or, at least, he 
gives the genuine impression that 
he does. And he wants to give 
everybody a complete experience; 

it’s like he doesn’t want to leave 
you wishing for anything if he 
can help it.

“We’re gonna play some old 

songs, some new songs and some 
in-between songs,” he said, right 
before launching into “Can’t 
Buy Me Love,” and so he did — 
spanning all the way from the 
oldest major song in his repertoire 
(“In Spite of All the Danger”) to 
the latest (“FourFiveSeconds”). 
Whether you were one of those 
fans who were here for The 
Beatles or for Wings or just for 
whatever McCartney felt like 
playing, your bases were covered.

McCartney also made it clear 

that he could easily tell which 
songs we all liked, because the 
stadium would “light up like a 
galaxy” whenever he played an 
old Beatles song, but when he 
switched to something newer, it 
would be “like a black hole.”

“But we don’t care!” he added. 

“We’re 
going 
to 
play 
them 

anyway!”

And he did — he played “My 

Valentine” on the piano for his 
wife, Nancy, and ripped through 
songs like “Queenie Eye” and 
“New” with the same boundless 
energy that would overtake him 
during the popular Beatles songs.

The 
slower 
songs 
were 

confessional and heavy, the faster 
ones lively. We swayed with 
McCartney through “Let It Be” 
and “Yesterday,” and we jumped 
and pumped our fists with him 
during “Nineteen Hundred and 
Eighty-Five” and the reprise of 
“Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts 
Club Band.”

But it wasn’t just the music that 

gave off the feeling that we were 
experiencing all of them joined 
with him; it was also deeply 
ingrained in the way he spoke. 
He told us stories about meeting 
Keith Richards and Mick Jagger 
on the streets of London and 
giving them the “I Wanna Be Your 
Man” single, and performing 
“Back in the USSR” twice in one 
concert at Red Square. When he 
asked everyone who’d ever tried 
to learn “Blackbird” on guitar 
to raise their hands, he joked, 
“And you all got it wrong,” before 
thanking us and saying, “That 
makes me feel really good.”

By the time the three hours 

were up and we filed out of the 
arena, back onto the streets of 
Detroit and under the sprawl of 
the faraway stars we’d known 
before, it felt like the close of 
a years-long journey. In a way, 
maybe it was; many people wait 
lifetimes to see the people they 
most look up to in person, and 
hearing these age-old anthems 
felt like the most recent tying-off 
of an experience that really began 
ages ago, whenever it was that we 
first heard them.

This is something I love about 

this type of concert. Of course, 
any concert can have energy, 
can grip you, and I’ve had so 
many 
fulfilling 
experiences 

with live music that it seems 
like a strange arena in which to 
make any comparisons at all. All 
I know is that it felt like magic 
to live through that show, with 
people of all different ages and 
backgrounds — many of whom 
have known this music longer 
than they can even trace back, so 
long that by this point it feels less 
like something learned and more 
like something intrinsic and felt. 
To be alive at the same time as 
someone you admire, out of all 
the times you could possibly have 
been alive, that is the feeling: 
a moment of real consequence 
joined, a home found, a wish 
granted. 

Recently, it was announced 

that J.J. Abrams (“Super 8”) 
would 
be 
replacing 
Colin 

Trevorrow (“Jurassic World”) 
as the director of the upcoming 
“Star Wars: Episode IX.” When 
all is said and done, Abrams 
will have directed four of the 
six major “Star Wars” and 
“Star Trek” releases made this 
decade. “Star Wars” and “Star 
Trek,” once forever at odds 
with each other, have in this 
nostalgia driven era of reboots, 
somehow became the same, 
appealing to the same part of 
the audience and being guided 
by the same director.

If you had told any major 

“Trekkies” or “Wars Nerds” of 
the last generation that one day 
the same man would control 
both franchises both groups 
would probably have suspected 
you of either being a member 
of the Borg collective or a 
Dark Lord of the Sith. To the 
unknowledgeable 
moviegoer 

these two franchises may seem 
pretty similar on the outside, 
but to anyone with more than a 
passing interest in the subject 
it is clear that the two are in 
fact anything but. Yes, both 

feature spaceships and aliens, 
but the themes and inherent 
structures of the series could 
not be more different. Since its 
creation by Gene Roddenberry 
in the late ’60s, “Star Trek” has 
been about exploring the great 
unknown, the final frontier, 
and displaying a version of 
humanity 
that 
has 
moved 

beyond the problems of class 
and race that plague us today. 
It’s about big theological ideas 
and hard sci-fi concepts. In 
contrast, “Star Wars” is a 
fantasy 
space 
opera, 
with 

wizards, 
secret 
siblings, 

magical 
swords 
and 
epic 

battles of good against evil. 
Both franchises are storied 
parts of our cultural history. 
Both have inspired countless 
imitators as well as each other. 
To simplify the differences 
down: “Star Trek” is for the 
brain, “Star Wars” is for the 
heart. Never should we have 
gotten to a place where the 
two are dangerously close to 
becoming interchangeable.

Allowing one man to put 

his defining stamp on both 
of the great science fiction 
franchises 
of 
all 
time 
is 

giving one man far too much 
cultural 
power. 
A 
similar 

situation is about to play out 
with the impending release of 
“Justice League” which, after 
original director Zack Snyder 
(“Batman v. Superman”) was 
forced to step away due to 
personal reasons, is now being 
completed by Joss Whedon of 
“Avengers” and “Buffy” fame. 
Should one man really get to 
shepherd both The Avengers 
and The Justice League to the 
big screen? Surely the point of 
having both an Avengers and a 
Justice League is to highlight 

the differences between the 
two? Why would we want to 
watch two superhero teams 
that are exactly the same? 
Why, for that matter, is it okay 
with us for the differences and 
peculiarities of “Star Wars” 
and “Star Trek” to become 
muddled until even their own 
fans can barely tell them apart?

The reboot “Trek” films, 

while fun movies in their own 
right, choose to leave behind 
the introspective nature of 
the franchise in favor of an 
action adventure vibe more 
similar to “Star Wars.” The 
recent premiere of “Star Trek: 
Discovery” has led to more 
comparisons with “Star Wars” 
and other big budget action 
spectacles. The decision by 
Lucasfilm to give Abrams his 
second crack at a “Star Wars” 
movie is a decision based 
purely in the logic of safety. 
It is a safe choice. It is a fine 
choice. What it is not is an 
inspired choice, and it will not 
leave us with a modern day 
“Star Wars” trilogy that pushes 
the boundaries of cinema, 
emotional 
storytelling, 
or 

special-effects in the ways 
that either the originals or the 
often-maligned prequels did. 
Turning “Star Wars” into a 
repetitive retread of what has 
come before and turning “Star 
Trek” into an action-adventure 
franchise ignores what made 
both 
of 
these 
franchises 

remarkable to begin with.

Science fiction has long been 

a place for experimentation, 
a place for different kinds of 
people with different voices 
to challenge and dare us to 
ask questions about each other 
and ourselves that we might 
not have otherwise. Letting 

our major sci-fi franchises be 
primarily controlled by one 
person or simply one kind 
of person severely limits the 
types of questions that science 
fiction can ask. All six of the 
major 
“Trek” 
and 
“Wars” 

pictures of this era will end 
up being directed by white 
men who rose up through 
the Hollywood system in an 
eerily similar way, four of 
those movies being directed by 
exactly the same guy. Science 
Fiction has always been a 
place of narrative and creative 
danger. We cannot allow it to 
become one of safety.

In the face of a choice 

between “Do or do not, there is 
no try” “Star Wars” has chosen 
“do not.” Afraid of taking risks, 

“Star Trek” has stopped going 
where no man has gone before 
and has begun retreading all 
the places we’ve already been. 
These are our most beloved 
science 
fiction 
properties. 

Generations of people have 
fallen 
in 
love 
with 
these 

universes and the characters 
housed 
within 
them. 
For 

decades “Star Wars” and “Star 
Trek” fans have argued over 
which franchise is superior. 
If we allow these two sagas to 
become interchangeable, there 
will be no more arguments, 
no more questions, no more 
wars and no more treks. There 
will just be stars like Abrams, 
continuing to capitalize on 
creative work that was done 
years ago by somebody else.

‘American Made’ bores

You may not know the name 

Barry Seal, but you know his 
story. You know Pablo Escobar, 
the Iran-Contra Affair, American 
paternalism 
towards 
Central 

America. You know 
the 
American 

Dream.

“American 

Made” tells a story 
not so much based 
on, 
but 
rather 

loosely inspired by, 
Seal’s life, who, as 
depicted in the film, 
was a commercial 
pilot-turned-CIA operative (Tom 
Cruise, “The Mummy”) tasked 
with taking aerial photographs of 
communists in Nicaragua, then 
with delivering captured Russian 
arms to the Contras in Honduras, 
who then became a drug runner 
for 
the 
Medellín 
Cartel 
in 

Colombia (serving a young Pablo 
Escobar). He was punished by the 
U.S. government not with prison 
but with a promotion, assigned 
to manufacture and capture 
evidence that the communist 
Sandinistas in Nicaragua were 
working in the drug trade with 
the Medellín Cartel. It was the 
’80s. And it was crazy.

And the film knows it. It draws 

heavily from its predecessors — 
black comedies that highlight 
episodes in capitalist power 
and collapse in recent history, 
like “The Wolf of Wall Street” 
and “The Big Short”— and 
appropriates 
the 
bombastic 

narrator, who addresses the 
audience with a sly satisfaction 

and promises if not warns 
that everything you see really 
happened.

That’s good enough for Cruise, 

whose recent roles (the last five 
of which are three different 
franchises 
and 
two 
science 

fiction action films) read more 
like the bad side of a big studio 
contract than a quality film guide. 

He’s in a different 
mode here (and, 
to note, at $50 
million, which is 
no small amount, 
this is the tightest 
budget 
of 
a 

Cruise movie in 
ten years). He’s 
got the charisma, 
sure, but at the 

film’s key moments, for better or 
worse (and it’s often the latter), 
Cruise seems locked into one 
emotion: 
effortless 
cool, 
yet 

astonished 
and 
bewildered. 

Every crest has a trough, and 
Cruise doesn’t sufficiently dive 
into depths of paranoia and 
despair that defines his life 
after his CIA career in the film’s 
denouement.

If there are other characters, 

they’re barely drawn. Excusable 
is Seal’s CIA contact, Monty 
Schafer 
(Domhnall 
Gleeson, 

“Brooklyn”), who serves as a 
plot driver, but inexcusable is 
Seal’s long-suffering wife, Lucy 
(Sarah Wright, “Marry Me”), 
who is given so little to do, it’s as 
if second-time screenwriter Gary 
Spinelli (“Stash House”) hasn’t 
paid attention to years and years 
of disappointment and anger over 
poorly written female roles. Lucy 
gets angry with Barry at first, and 
then takes the ride for the money, 
and we know nothing of how 

she’s really feeling.

The problem is that while 

antecedents of “American Made” 
are well directed and acted on top 
of a compelling story, “American 
Made” can only claim the last of 
those attributes. Doug Liman, 
the otherwise competent but 
not outstanding director behind 
“The Bourne Identity” and the 
more recent Cruise action film 
“Edge of Tomorrow,” is the weak 
link here. Handed on a plate 
an absurdly great plot, Liman 
mangles his film with utterly 
bizarre 
filmmaking 
choices. 

In order to ape the sort of faux 
documentary style promulgated 
by “The Big Short” and “The 
Wolf of Wall Street,” Liman 
features a number of cut-aways 
to photographs and historical 
footage, but none help move the 
story along. Cinematographer 
César 
Charlone 
(“Blindness”) 

escalates the shaky camera work 
of “The Big Short” to something 
much more dizzying, if not 
nauseating, though sometimes. 
The worst offense is a seemingly 
absent understanding of how 
shots ought to be constructed. 
Charlone’s cinematography is 
beyond chaotic: it’s an assault on 
spatial logic. It’s hard to describe, 
but the best analogy at hand 
currently is if the director were 
a spastic eight-year-old given a 
35mm camera and instructed to 
make a two-hour film in just as 
much time. All the more stranger 
is that Tom Cruise, one of the 
biggest movie stars of all time, 
appears in nearly every slipshod 
frame. Liman may have been 
visually uninteresting before, but 
with “American Made” he verges 
into visual repugnancy.

launched A$AP Mob more 
than a decade ago, their vision 
expanded well beyond the 
boundaries of rap: Together, 
the duo recruited a diverse 
collective 
of 
creative-types 

and took critical early steps to 
broadcast their Harlem-gone-
Hollywood style. Both imagery 
and aesthetic were vital to 
the Mob’s branding from the 
start, with fashion adding an 
extra vehicle through which 
music 
could 
be 
marketed. 

From this tradition stemmed 
popular hits, buzzy streetwear 
labels and short films, projects 
that often feel disconnected 
creatively, yet are united by 
their now-famous mantra.

But what exactly is the 

A$AP mantra, if not solely 
a 
promotional 
prop? 
It 

was once natural to view 
the 
group 
as 
a 
tight-knit 

fraternity, 
its 
members 
a 

#rare blend of neighborhood 
connections who, for obvious 
reasons, found it mutually 
beneficial to link and build 
beneath 
a 
common 
alias. 

Since 
Yams’s 
heartbreaking 

passing in 2015, though, unity 
among its members has felt 
opportunistic: It’s difficult to 
imagine Rocky — the Mob’s 
staple A-list celebrity, who 
models for Dior and has dated 
a Jenner — hanging out with 
his old pals when business isn’t 
involved. Plus, the addition of 
an out-of-towner — Atlanta’s 
Playboi Carti — best known for 
revitalizing East Coast hip-hop 
is rather diluting of its ethos.

Amid 
this 
mild 
identity 

crisis, A$AP Mob has released 
a new crew tape — Cozy 
Tapes Vol. 2: Too Cozy — and 
launched a North American 
tour. Both ventures aim to 
satisfy (or at least quiet) fans’ 
hunger for new music from 
Rocky, who has not released 
a solo album in almost three 
years. Yet, despite the rapper’s 
natural role as the traveling 
circus’s ringmaster, he is not 
its exclusive headliner: The 
Too Cozy Tour exists to bring 
lesser-watched 
members 
of 

A$AP — such as Twelvyy, who 
also released a solo album 
in 
#Awgest 
(read: 
August) 

— into fully packed theaters 
nationwide. 

It’s in this vein that A$AP 

Mob 
arrived 
at 
Detroit’s 

Masonic Temple on Fri., Sept. 
29th, luring a flood of mostly 
college and late-high-school-
aged kids downtown for a 
full night of hip-hop-inspired 
mosh pits. By 8:00 p.m., the 
general admission pit’s crowd 
was already spilling over its 
brims, its tightly-packed (and 
mostly intoxicated) attendees 
screaming along as recent hits 
like “Bodak Yellow” and “XO 
Tour Llif3” helped pass the 
time.

Once A$AP Nast emerged on 

stage, the show was underway. 
Despite 
lacking 
depth 
in 

his discography, Nast is a 
profound technical rapper true 
to the spirit of New York, and 
his performances of boom-
bap tracks “Nasty’s World” 
and “Trillmatic” allowed him 
to prove so. He was followed 
promptly by A$AP Twelvyy, 
who — coming off the heels 
of his long-overdue debut LP, 
12 — used his time to perform 
gritty solo cuts that wouldn’t 
otherwise fit into the night’s 
turnt-up setlist.

After 
opening 
with 

“Periodic 
Table,” 
Twelvyy 

warned 
Detroiters 
to 
“put 

(their) guns up,” then dove 
into 
ammunition-themed 

anthem “Strapped,” which was 
followed by “Ea$t$ideGho$t.” 
Before rapping the latter, he 
proudly announced that the 
Mob has been visiting the city 
since its inaugural touring 
effort —the Long Live A$AP 
Tour — in 2013, a notion 
that 
morbidly 
dated 
their 

joint 
shenanigans, 
at 
least 

slightly. He then closed with 
the inspiring “LYBB (Last 
Year Being Broke),” earning 
consistent 
feedback 
during 

its choruses, and departed 
from the stage, only to return 
shortly thereafter.

When A$AP Mob finally 

stormed the stage as a troop, 
walking 
out 
to 
epilepsy-

inducing 
flashes 
and 
the 

explosive 
“Yamborghini 

High,” it was Rocky who stood 
front and center, briefly by his 
lonesome, with an Off-White 
belt dangling in his trail, 
holding 
up 
paint-splattered 

jeans. In the background were 
two 
Lamborghini 
vehicles, 

parked and converted into 

luxury DJ booths, plus a parade 
of his cohorts, acknowledging 
of their sidekick statuses.

Though the songs performed 

across the next hour came 
mostly from the group’s joint 
projects 
(“Telephone 
Calls” 

and “Crazy Brazy” off the first 
Cozy Tapes; “Blowin’ Minds,” 
“Black Card” and many more 
from 
the 
second), 
Rocky 

managed 
to 
maintain 
the 

spotlight throughout, acting 
as a master of ceremonies. 
Before “Please Shut Up,” he set 
the tone by asking the crowd: 
“How many people got that 
boss or parent that y’all just 
want to smack the shit out 
of?” Then, backtracking only 
slightly, added: “But they got 
this thing called the law… So, if 
you don’t wanna go to jail, you 
can calmly, politely ask that 
person…”

“Please shut up!” the crowd 

gleefully roared in response.

“Bahamas” 
received 

a 
similarly 
enticing 

introduction, 
with 
Rocky 

probing fans to open up mosh 
pits through teases like, “Y’all 
niggas ain’t ever been to a 
A$AP Mob concert?” It was 
followed by Twelvyy’s “Hop 
Out,” then a brief ode to Ferg, 
who skipped Detroit despite 
being an otherwise regular 
part of the tour.

Even 
when 
sharing 
the 

spotlight, 
though, 
Rocky 

remained 
in 
total 
control, 

earning 
the 
night’s 
most 

emphatic reactions during his 
a cappella lead-ins to songs 
such as “Multiply” and “Feel 
So Good.” Appropriately, “Get 
That Bag” — which features all 
members of A$AP Mob — was 
one of the night’s final songs. 
However, as if the show simply 
could not end without a total 
acknowledgement of Rocky’s 
core status, it was followed by 
a raucous solo cut of his.

“We are not letting this 

nigga A$AP Rocky leave this 
stage. He’s too hot!” said 
someone, it barely matters 
who. 
Sure 
enough, 
Rocky 

swiftly returned for a final 
verse, one which everyone was 
expected to know.

“Who the jiggy nigga with 

the gold links?”

Who else but Lord Pretty 

Flacko Jodye, the leader — and 
still the primary selling point 
— of the entire A$AP Mob?

Secondary to face new test against Spartans

Jim Harbaugh’s assessment 

was brief, yet accurate. 

“He throws very well, runs very 

well,” Harbaugh said of Michigan 
State quarterback Brian Lewerke 
on Monday. “He has a penchant 
for making the big play.”

Against Western Michigan, 

Lewerke flashed an example of his 
playmaking ability, taking a read 
option 61 yards to the house — a 
play on which he beat the safety 
and linebacker in a foot race.

Through four games, Lewerke 

has completed 84 of his 133 
attempts for 963 yards. He boasts 
eight passing touchdowns and has 
thrown just two interceptions.

As for Lewerke’s ability on the 

ground, Harbaugh might have 
been making an understatement. 
He leads the Spartans in rushing 
yards and touchdowns, with 248 
and two, respectively.

And therein lies the latest 

challenge 
for 
a 
Michigan 

secondary that ranks as the 
fourth-best passing defense in 

the nation. Lewerke and the 
Spartans present a threat that 
this young Wolverine defense has 
yet to face.

To this point, that unit may 

still be getting overlooked on 
the 
grand 
scale. 
Sophomore 

cornerback Lavert Hill admitted 
as much. That’s what happens 
when your team boasts a defensive 
line leading the country in sacks 
and a linebacker like Devin Bush 
Jr. who has made the case that he 
is the best player on the roster.

But it’s those same reasons 

that perhaps escalate the threat 
that Lewerke could pose to the 
Wolverines’ secondary. Michigan 
may have the ability to collapse 
the pocket, but Lewerke has 
a knack for escaping it. And 
while the secondary has been 
exceptional at times, it has also 
been susceptible to big plays — a 
busted-coverage play against Air 
Force that turned into a 64-yard 
touchdown reception being the 
most startling example.

On top of Lewerke’s individual 

ability, he has a useful crop of 
receivers as his weapons. Felton 

Davis leads that group, fresh off 
a performance against Iowa in 
which he caught nine passes for 
114 yards and two touchdowns.

“Just from watching the film, 

they keep their routes on when 
he’s on his feet and he’s constantly 
looking downfield,” said junior 
safety Tyree Kinnel. “So I feel 
like we’re gonna have a great 
chance to get back there and push 
him out the pocket a lot during 
this game, so the secondary has 
to stay on the receivers as much 
as we can.”

Added defensive backs coach 

Brian Smith: “(The secondary 
will) face a good challenge. 
They have good solid receivers. 
They’re young. Felton’s coming 
off a good game against Iowa 
and he’s a threat down the field. 
He’s a tall guy that they can go 
out and throw him the ball and 
then he can come down and get 
it. He poses a problem, and they’ll 
spread it around a good bit. We’ve 
got our hands full.”

Still, the trio of Kinnel, Hill 

and sophomore cornerback David 
Long have plenty going well for 

them.

The Wolverines are allowing 

just 134 yards per game in the air, 
rank second nationally in team 
passing efficiency defense and 
have shown an affinity for forcing 
turnovers — recording three 
interceptions for 52 yards and two 
touchdowns.

The unexpected production, 

in large part, is a product of 
improved 
communication 
— 

an aspect that Hill pointed out 
Monday afternoon.

And when asked about it 

Wednesday 
afternoon, 
Smith 

acknowledged the same thing. He 
said he couldn’t point to a specific 
play or series, but that the Purdue 
game stood out.

The Boilermakers, of course, 

implemented plenty of trickery 
and Michigan was capable of 
handling it. In the first half, 
Purdue posted 139 yards in the air. 
In the second half, the Wolverines 
conceded just 25.

But the one phase that stood 

out to Smith was Michigan’s 
ability to stop the jet sweep 
package, a collection of plays that 
he said have given the Wolverines 
some problems in the past.

“The 
communication 
has 

improved with the group as 
a whole,” Smith said. “Again, 
just seeing things over and over 
again — the first time, guys learn 
differently. Some guys learn in the 
classroom, and other guys learn 
by actually going out on the field 
and doing it, getting reps.

“You can see it, when teams 

give us different looks — maybe a 
look that we haven’t seen before — 
and we can adjust to it. That’s the 
result of guys communicating and 
getting on the same page.”

Michigan 
has 
faced 
an 

up-tempo offense. It has faced 
the triple-option. And it has 
faced a two-quarterback system 
brimming with deception.

Now, another look is coming to 

Ann Arbor. And if the Wolverines’ 
defensive backfield can adjust 
to this one, its place among 
nationally-ranked secondaries is 
going to look a lot more legitimate. 

ICE HOCKEY
Lockwood looks to be 
more complete player

As the Michigan hockey team 

wound down practice Wednesday, 
Will Lockwood, as usual, was one 
of the last players to leave the ice.

According to his coach, Mel 

Pearson, that’s no surprise. It’s 
why the Wolverines’ new coach 
has 
gained 
an 
even 
greater 

appreciation for Lockwood since 
watching him from the opposing 
sideline while coaching Michigan 
Tech last season.

“That’s how you define a true 

hockey player,” Pearson said. 
“When they enjoy practice and 
they can’t wait to get to the rink 
and get on the ice.”

Due to a nagging shoulder 

injury, though, Lockwood wasn’t 
on the ice quite as much as he 
would have liked last season. As 
a freshman, the forward quickly 
made a name for himself, finishing 
with 20 points on eight goals and 
12 assists — good for second on the 
team in all three categories. But 
the injury kept Lockwood out of 
five games, and restricted him at 
times when he did play.

During 
the 
offseason, 

Lockwood had surgery on his 
shoulder, undergoing a multi-stage 
rehabilitation process he described 
as “pretty tedious.”

“After you get the surgery, a lot 

of it is getting your motion back, so 
that’s the first month,” Lockwood 
said. “Then getting some strength 
into the muscle is the next couple 
of months, and then after that it’s 
strengthening it past what it was so 
you can prevent it from happening 
again.”

But Lockwood did see a silver 

lining in being limited, and at 
times, sidelined last year. The 
injury helped him understand the 
need to continue adding facets 
to his game and fine-tuning his 
technical skills alongside his raw 
athletic attributes.

“I like to play a very physical 

style,” Lockwood said. “(I) kind of 
have to shy away from that a little 
bit more this season. It’s not going to 
change the way I play in the corners 
or the way I have confidence going 
into the dirty areas, but I think the 
game’s changed a lot, where it’s 
a lot of speed and skill. So that’s 
something I want to focus on a little 
more this year.

“The game’s always changing, 

and that’s the side of the game 
that everyone’s adapting to right 
now, so I’m going to try to use my 
strength, my speed and skill to my 
advantage.”

And Lockwood has plenty 

to use to his advantage. He’s 
one of the Wolverines’ fastest 
skaters — Pearson describes him 
as “explosive” and “dynamic.” 
Pearson’s new offensive system 
also plays into Lockwood’s biggest 
strengths by emphasizing quick 
movement.

Michigan caught a glimpse of 

that Saturday against Western 
Ontario. Halfway through the 
second period, Lockwood tore 
after the puck on a breakaway 
and was brought down near the 
Mustangs’ goal. On the ensuing 
penalty shot, Lockwood smoothly 
sped towards goal, deked right and 
calmly deposited the puck into the 
net for a 4-0 Wolverine lead.

Considering 
his 
substantial 

physical gifts, a more refined — 
not to mention fully healthy — 
Lockwood has the potential to 
be a dominant offensive force for 
Michigan this season. But even if 
that were not the case, his passion 
and work ethic have already won 
Pearson’s endearment.

“A lot of guys think they’re 

players or want to be a player,” 
Pearson said. “But you have the 
guys that really, really, really 
want to be players, and there’s a 
difference.

“He’s full out. There’s no 

halfway or taking drills off, he’s 
full out all the time. He’s just a 
hockey player.”

Amid scathing NCAA scandal, 
Beilein remains unblemished

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

coach John Beilein can afford a lax 
answer when discussing the recent 
FBI investigations into violations 
at college basketball programs. 
He’s earned that luxury. 

“I take a couple showers a 

day,” Beilein said. “That keeps me 
clean.”

Some 
coaches 
around 
the 

country, it appears, need to shower 
more often.

Last week, the FBI released 

findings of mass corruption within 
college 
basketball, 
stemming 

from payment of recruits and 
the untidy relationships between 
shoe companies and recruiting. 
The FBI arrested four assistant 
coaches last Tuesday. Louisville, 
currently the most high-profile 
school implicated, has effectively 
fired its legendary coach Rick 
Pitino and has placed its athletic 
director, Tom Jurich, on a leave of 
absence.

Lousiville is the first major 

victim. It doesn’t seem likely to be 
the last.

While coaches around the 

country plan calculated responses 
with public relations staff to fend 
off reporters’ inquiries, Beilein 
doesn’t have to sweat. 

After all, he was recently voted 

the “cleanest coach in college 
basketball” in a poll of 100 of his 
coaching peers.

Wednesday, when speaking to 

reporters, a jovial Beilein didn’t 
tense up, nor recite some painfully-
rehearsed plea of innocence.

Instead 
he 
came 
to 
the 

defense of the integrity of college 
basketball.

“How isolated is it? I do not 

think it’s rampant among NCAA,” 
Beilein said. “I don’t think the sky 
is falling in college basketball. I 
think there’s certainly some rogue 
coaches. How many? Maybe I’ll be 
proven wrong, but I don’t think 
there’s too much of that going out 
there.

“There’s a lot of really, really 

clean coaches out there.”

While “the dark underbelly of 

college basketball,” as US Attorney 
Joon H. Kim described, slowly 
comes to the fore, Beilein remains 
perched above the fray. 

He admits to having lost 

recruits over his staff’s overt “tone 
of compliance,” but notes that 
those aren’t the types of players he 
would want at Michigan anyway.

“People 
— 
whether 
its 

parents or prospects — if they 
are looking for that, they’re not 
talking with me or we’re off 
their list immediately,” Beilein 
said. “Because they know it’s not 
happening here, so we don’t even 
have to deal with it. It might not 
get us some recruits. Well, we 
don’t want those recruits that 
come for any other reason than 
what Michigan is all about.”

In 2009, Beilein was named 

head 
of 
the 
NCAA 
Men’s 

Basketball Ethics Coalition. He 
takes compliance seriously and 
doesn’t think he’s alone in doing 
so.

“I’m not trying to put ourselves 

on some pedestal,” Beilein said. 
“Most programs are doing it this 
way. I believe that deep in my 
heart, most of us are doing it.”

Though 
he 
maintained 
a 

joking tone at times, Beilein was 
unmistakeably stern in regard to 
his coaching peers who do violate 
the rules. 

“If people are breaking the law, 

if people are committing felony 
crimes in our business,” Beilein 
said, “then get them the heck out 
of our business.” 

“College basketball is my life, 

and it should be clean.”

Beilein went on to commend 

his team’s defensive grit, lament 
the hefty travel schedule, detail 
the trials and tribulations of the 
incoming freshmen class, discuss 
fifth-year transfer guard Jaaron 
Simmons’ desire to make the 
NCAA tournament and more. 
He didn’t dwell on the black 
cloud looming above the college 
basketball world.

He didn’t have to.

Michigan falls to Iowa on the road

Despite the efforts of junior 

outside hitter Carly Skojdt — who 
posted a season-high 22 kills — 
the No. 22 Michigan volleyball 
team fell to Iowa on Wednesday 
night in a four-set battle.

Skojdt put the team on her back, 

as the next highest scorer for 
the Wolverines totaled just nine 
kills. Skojdt pulled together the 
22 kills on a total of 59 attempts, 
solidifying her role as Michigan’s 
offensive workhorse.

“We need more of it,” said 

coach 
Mark 
Rosen. 
“We’re 

obviously really excited about 
how she’s playing — she’s playing 
really hard. But we have other 
players who can step up and be in 
the mix with her.”

Coming off a strong weekend, 

in which it beat Ohio State and 
Maryland at home, Michigan 
went into the match looking to 
continue its hot streak.

The Wolverines started strong, 

decisively winning the first set 
of the match, 25-21. Everything 
was clicking early as Michigan 
maintained 
a 
.326 
hitting 

percentage, its highest of any set 

during the match. The Wolverines 
also racked up 19 kills during the 
set, setting the tone early.

“I think we started out really 

well,” Rosen said. “The first 
half we played really steady. 
Defensively, we did a good job, we 
executed the gameplan, and the 
first set we started well. But then 
we let our execution go down.”

The 
explosive 
Michigan 

offense of the first 
set 
seemingly 

vanished. 
After 

that, its hitting 
percentage 
dwindled to .256 
in the second set 
before dipping to 
a shocking .079 in 
the third set.

The 

Wolverines 
still 
managed 

to put together 
a respectable second set, only 
dropping it, 25-22. Michigan 
even started the set strong, 
establishing a 16-11 lead, but a 
composed and balanced Hawkeye 
team mounted a steady comeback 
to claim the set.

The Wolverines then seemingly 

hit the panic button as Iowa 

waltzed through the third set to 
a decisive 25-15 win. Michigan 
never led as the Hawkeye offense 
found its groove.

With the end of the match 

inching closer, Michigan made a 
last-minute rally in the fourth set 
to try and salvage the night but 
eventually fell short, dropping the 
last set, 25-21.

“(The team) played really, 

really well, but I 
think we didn’t 
do a good enough 
job defensively,” 
Rosen said.

The 

Wolverines will 
look to bolster 
their 
defensive 

unit 
before 

facing a talented 
Minnesota team 
on 
Saturday. 

Rosen will look 

to leaders such as Skojdt, senior 
middle blocker Claire Kieffer-
Wright, senior outside hitter 
Adeja Lambert to lead the team to 
a bounce-back performance.

“Those guys usually do a great 

job,” Rosen said. “Those are the 
players we look to, and we’ll look 
to them next weekend.”

Dueling Columns: 2017

R

especting our opponents in 
this “touch” football game 
has become very difficult.

Every year, The Michigan Daily 

plays The State News. And every 
year, your staff 
continues to 
degrade itself.

Maybe I 

should have 
expected 
that, but to 
be honest, as 
a New York 
native, the 
Michigan-
Michigan State 
rivalry was entirely foreign to me 
four years ago.

With all due respect to Cortland 

and Ithaca’s annual matchup, 
my home state isn’t exactly the 
epicenter of college football. It took 
much convincing on my brothers’ 
part for me to come to Michigan at 
all. The only memory I had of the 
Wolverines’ football program was 
their loss to Appalachian State in 
2007.

It didn’t take long for me to catch 

up on the history, but the first real 
taste I had of the in-state rivalry 
didn’t happen within the confines 
of a football stadium.

I worked in a deli the summer 

before I came to Ann Arbor for 
the first time. And on my last 
day of work, I was ringing up my 
final customer. I turned to hand 
a woman her bags, expecting 
the interaction to be no different 
than the hundreds like it that I’d 
experienced that summer. I was 
wrong. 

As it turned out, she was a 

Michigan State alum. I handed her 
the bag, she glanced at the block ‘M’ 
hat I was wearing and looked me in 
the eyes.

“Don’t start thinking you’re 

better than everyone else,” she said, 
“just because you go to Michigan.”

I didn’t then. I don’t now.
At that point, I never planned 

on contributing to my university’s 
student publication. But after 
joining the Daily during my first 
year here, I have come to realize the 
rivalry between our newspapers is 
what I really care about.

As a freshman, I watched one of 

your players get ejected for tackling 
one of our writers to the ground 
and punching him in the head. 

Later in the same game, I watched 
members of your staff — and your 
adviser, for that matter — laugh at 
my friend after he tore his ACL.

A year later, having not spent 

a minute actually playing in the 
game, your editor-in-chief had 
some choice words for me at the 
50-yard line. Sorry to disappoint, 
but the one-sided dialogue isn’t fit 
to print here. Children might be 
reading.

And last year, your team still 

found comic relief in an injury, 
making a backhanded comment 
to one of our staffers about his 
“daddy’s health care” as he 
struggled to walk off the field.

But that game — the Daily’s 12th 

consecutive win — did have one 
redeeming moment. After we won 
on your field, one of your football 
beat writers came to our sideline 
and thanked us for making the trip 
to East Lansing.

I appreciated the rare case of 

sportsmanship — almost as much 
as I appreciated the column he 
needed to write two days later, 
clarifying the headline printed 
on The State News’ front page 
following Michigan’s 32-23 win 
over Michigan State.

That headline read, “Defeated 

with Dignity – MSU lost the Paul 
Bunyan trophy but prevented a 
blowout against U-M.”

That’s quite the spin, so much 

that I had to go back and make 
sure Michigan State still had that 
journalism school State Newsers 
always talk about.

In the second and third 

paragraphs of his column, he wrote:

“Upon filing the story, I left 

the spot for the headline blank, 
as I usually have no say in the 
process of titling an article. I left 
the newsroom after the story was 
complete, long before it ever went 
to print.

“By the time I woke on Monday, 

I saw the headline and was 
disgusted.”

He went on to write critically 

about Michigan State’s effort and 
performance to that point in the 
2016 season, and he wrote it well. 
Somehow, though, somebody in 
your newsroom thought — or, it 
seems, desperately hoped — that 
headline was indicative of the 
game.

But here’s the thing: that debacle 

wouldn’t happen at the Daily. Not 
only do our writers create their own 
headlines, but we have a thorough 
editing process to ensure we aren’t 
hopelessly biased. Apparently that’s 
not the case in East Lansing.

Our writers are given the 

opportunity to chase a passion 
and make this newspaper what it 
has been for 127 years, whether 
that’s by covering a soccer team, 
a volleyball team or, eventually, a 
football team.

When it comes to our football 

game, some may take exception to 
the size of our staff — claiming that 
it has contributed to our success 
over the last 12 years. But it’s for 
that same reason that we don’t need 
a journalism school.

Our staff is given the chance 

to learn through the experience 
of publishing a daily newspaper. 
That requires individuals to work 
collaboratively until 1 a.m. every 
night. Sitting in a college lecture 
hall, or publishing a print edition 
just twice a week, can’t replicate 
that.

At the end of the day, the broader 

rivalry can be boiled down to my 
interaction in that deli.

Students at Michigan make 

assumptions about their 
counterparts in East Lansing. 
Students at Michigan State 
make assumptions about their 
counterparts in Ann Arbor.

I’m not here to make 

assumptions. I haven’t grown to 
know anyone at Michigan State 
well enough to make any sweeping 
declarations about your student 
body.

What I have grown to know 

pretty well, though, is The State 
News. And I think I’ve gathered 
enough knowledge to say this: I 
don’t think I’m better than you. 
But I know my newspaper — on 
a football field and in every 
journalistic sense — is.

We’ve defeated you 12 years in a 

row. We’re going to defeat you again 
Friday night. And the saddest part 
is, if past games are any indicator, 
you won’t be able to claim dignity 
this time, either.

N

ote: Most of you are likely 
confused because I am not 
a football reporter, a sports 

editor or a man. This column over the 
years somehow became dominated 
by one type of person, so welcome to 
my readers.

I’m reminded of “Mad Men” 

Season 5, Episode 8. Michael Gins-
berg approaches Don Draper livid 
about a call 
Draper made 
during a pitch 
meeting.

Ginsberg 

attacks 
Draper for his 
choices, his 
role and more 
importantly, 
his character. 
He finishes 
his frustrated 
exaggeration with one final jab and 
says, “I feel bad for you.”

In a calm, almost soothing voice, 

without looking Ginsberg in the 
eye, Draper says, “I don’t think 
about you at all.”

The State News, only in this 

sense, is Draper. The Michigan 
Daily is Ginsberg. That is the best 
way to explain how The State News 
feels about the Michigan Daily.

We don’t think about you. We 

don’t care what you do.

But, the last year of name-calling 

and “fake news” made me decide 
that we can no longer afford to 
ignore you. News organizations 
need each other for both 
competition and camaraderie. We 
are under attack in some respects.

By attacking each other we not 

only show our immaturity, but we 
don’t get anywhere. We’re tearing 
each other down and people are 
already trying to do that enough.

My mom always says you should 

say what you believe, but it is all a 
lie if you don’t walk the walk. So, I 
donated $5 to the Michigan Daily.

No, seriously.
I believe in what all of you do, but 

I do think you can do it a lot better. 

We serve our community. We work 
hard. We do all of this quietly, no 
fuss. Despite what all of you may 
think about us, you can learn from 
our newsroom.

As an investor, here are some of 

my thoughts.

The digital age is here and your 

newsroom needs to adapt better. 
I admire the diligent connection 
to a print product. I read two print 
newspapers a day. However, your 
content needs to make better 
shifts to online. Infographics and 
interactives are a perfect example 
of where you can succeed. Instead, 
I see screenshotted infographics 
made for print.

Event coverage — you do plenty 

of it. One more story on a panel and 
I will scream. Trends and issues 
stories are in short supply.

One of my favorite stories from 

your newsroom was reported by 
your editor-in-chief and it delved 
into mental health issues on your 
campus. The in-depth reporting 
made an impression, and more 
importantly it shined a light on a 
real issue.

Your sports section is, as usual, 

the part of your newsroom which 
receives the most attention. 
Don’t ignore that. Hold athletics 
accountable. In some ways you do, 
but both of our newsrooms need to 
shift our focus to that conclusion.

The State News is not perfect, 

but I’ll tell you a secret: neither 
is the Michigan Daily. We are 
learning our craft. Regardless, 
collegiate journalism is essential to 
our audiences.

People like to pit us against each 

other. Despite what all of you might 
think, I don’t hate you. In most 
ways, I root for you. I would hope 
all of you could get over yourselves 
enough to root for us, too. We’re 
on the same team, just on opposite 
sides of the field. In my mind, the 
rivalry is a technicality.

I suppose I didn’t really write a 

dueling column, which might upset 
some, but I’m fine with that. I spoke 

my truth. That’s all I want to do.

My last piece of advice: If 

you want to stand on someone’s 
shoulders and call yourselves tall 
that’s fine, but you’re better than 
it. We both need to be better than 
that.

A few years ago, during my first 

football game, I realized something.

After your players scored the 

final touchdown and all of you 
rushed the field, I was upset for a 
split second and then it hit me — 
like that elbow which broke one of 
our player’s teeth, still waiting on 
that apology, but I digress — this 
game means so much more to all of 
you than it does to all of us.

I looked back at my comrades 

who were exiting the field. All of 
them appeared disappointed, but 
then like a switch they started to 
smile and congratulate each other.

After that, you left my mind for 

good.

You can have your football 

games and ivory towers because 
even when you win, you lose. 
There are always people like you, 
but nobody roots for you. No one 
ever will until you understand 
what is so much more important 
— your newsroom – even if the 
“impossible” happens and you lose 
on Friday.

I have a group of scrappy kids 

who work hard for me every day. 
They make me better version of 
myself.

You take your track record, your 

numbers and your shiny fields, I’ll 
still take my underdogs any news 
day.

I like my pick. I hope you like 

yours.

Stay vigilant, my rivals.
