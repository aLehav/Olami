MCity Launches Driverless 
Shuttles on North Campus

Self-driving cars 
now running five 

days a week

By ROB DALKA

Daily Staff Reporter

On Monday, Mcity launched 

their driverless shuttles on the 
University of Michigan’s North 
Campus. 
The 
shuttles 
run 

Monday through Friday, from 
9 a.m. until 3 p.m. The current 
shuttle encompasses the North 
Campus Research Complex, a 
one-mile round trip, with future 
plans to extend the route down to 
the Lurie Engineering Center.

According to Mcity’s website, 

the project is the first of its kind 
to focus on consumer research of 
driverless shuttles.

For the automated shuttles 

to be approved, Mcity complied 
with various levels of oversight 
and worked to make sure they 
were 
meeting 
regulations. 

Mcity worked with Institutional 

Autonomous Systems Committee 
to be sure they were meeting 
the regulations for autonomous 
vehicles. Mcity also received 
permission from the Institutional 
Review Board, as part of their 
research involves human subjects 
and their experiences with the 
shuttles.

Sarah Wentzloff, the program 

manager for the shuttle launch, 
commented on the hard work and 
time put into the project.

“The biggest challenge was 

being the first,” Wentzloff said. 
“Everyone was learning what had 
to be done to get us on the road.”

The 
program 
is 
currently 

comprised 
of 
two 
shuttles, 

capable of holding 11 passengers 
each. These shuttles are fully 
electric and were manufactured 
by the French firm, NAVYA. 
A shuttle will drive along a 
prescribed route at 12 miles per 
hour, using invisible lasers to 
create a view of its surroundings 
and a GPS system to keep track 
of location. The shuttle is able to 
come to a complete stop quickly if 

it senses another car, pedestrian 
or other obstacle obstructing the 
road. If a car is stopped in front of 
it for a longer than normal period 
of time, the shuttle will honk its 
horn.

Although these shuttles are 

driverless, a safety conductor 
is on board at all times with 
the ability to stop the shuttle in 
case of emergency. Along with 
the emergency stop button, a 
Microsoft Xbox 360 controller 
can be used by the safety 
conductor to manually drive the 
shuttle.

Currently, the safety conductor 

also is in control of when a shuttle 
will start moving after coming 
to a stop. At each intersection at 
which the shuttle stops, the safety 
conductor checks if it is safe 
before telling the shuttle to start 
moving again. The shuttle does 
have the capabilities to make this 
decision itself, but the current 
procedure was put in place for the 
initial rollout.

University 
Hosts Teach-
Out Academy
Other institutions to 
adopt U-M’s model

By ZOE BAXTER

Daily Staff Reporter

In 
1965, 
U-M 
faculty 
members 

organized the first ever teach-in on the 
Vietnam War. The event drew in over 
3,000 University students and the concept 
spread to numerous higher education 
institutions across the country.

Last year, the Office of Academic 

Innovation began the Teach-Out Series. 
Its website describes the series as “an 
opportunity for learners around the 
world to come together with our campus 
community in conversation on topics 
of widespread interest,” emphasizing 
that teach-outs are free and accessible to 
anyone through online platforms such as 
Coursera. 

“The University of Michigan Teach-

Out Series can be a model for a new era 
of 
engagement 
between 
institutions 

of higher education and the global 
communities they serve,” James Hilton, 
University librarian and dean of libraries, 
said in a previous Daily article.

Now, the idea is spreading to other 

institutions across the country including 
Brown University, Davidson College, 
Emory 
University, 
MIT, 
Stanford 

University, 
Texas 
A&M 
University, 

University 
of 
Colorado, 
University 

of Illinois, University of Notre Dame 
and 
University 
of 
Pennsylvania. 

Representatives from each of these 
schools attended a two-day “Teach-Out 
Academy” hosted by the University to 
learn more about this unique method of 
engagement.

At the academy, the representatives had 

the opportunity to discuss their own ideas 
with OAI faculty.

Andy Herring, a Texas A&M professor 

of animal science, attended the academy 
because he believes teach-outs can help 
encourage 
informed 
discussions 
on 

campus.

Council Discusses 
Game Day Condos

Councilmembers 
review zoning laws

By SAYALI AMIN

Daily Staff Reporter

On Monday June 4, Ann Arbor 
City Council convened to discuss 
a variety of issues, including the 
Unified Development Code as well 
as implications of zoning laws on the 
proposed construction of new game-
day condos.
The revision of the UDC was 
first brought up by a group of 
residents during the public hearing. 
Wendy Carman, a member of the 
Environmental Commission, said 
she was in support of a consolidated 
ordinance and has reviewed parts of 
the new working draft.
“The 
draft 
went 
almost 
completely unnoticed by the public,” 
Carman said. “I began with the 
Wetland Ordinance and I found 
one glaring mistake — a missing 
sentence requiring a permit to drain 
a wetland.”
Carman said the mistake was later 
corrected, but explained that there 

was no process in place to catch these 
errors. It took Carman four months 
to review a small portion of the more 
than 200-page document.
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, suggested 
postponing discussion to the second 
council meeting in June, while 
Councilmember Jack Eaton, D-Ward 
4, said it should be postponed to the 
second meeting in July.
“We really need to have a chart,” 
Eaton said. “When you do complex 
legislation like this and you move all 
the parts around you should have 
a cross-reference chart of it, where 
it used to be and where it ended up. 
This is what we should be doing, 
instead we issued a report that was 
275 pages long and 656 footnotes, 
pointing things that had been done to 
the previous code.”
Ackerman 
said 
any 
desired 
changes to the zoning laws should 
be carried out through the UDC and 
should not be tabled for months. 
Ultimately, City Council voted to 
move the decision to July 16.

Partnerships focus 
on women’s health in 
Sub-Saharan Africa

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

A University of Michigan-led 
study published May 1 in the 
American College of Surgeons 
Bulletin reported partnerships 
between 
the 
Obstetrics 
and 
Gynecology departments of high-
income 
academic 
institutions 
and corresponding departments 
of 
sub-Saharan 
African 
institutions have the potential 
to 
greatly 
improve 
maternal 
and neonatal medical care. The 
study referenced several U-M 
collaborations that enrich ob-gyn 
training 
and 
improve 
access 
to women’s health care in sub-
Saharan nations.
According 
to 
Timothy 
R.B. 
Johnson, 
ob-gyn 
chair 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
the 
University has a long history 
of academic partnerships with 
medical institutions in other 
countries, 
especially 
Ghana. 
Johnson 
founded 
an 
ob-gyn 
clinic in Ghana in 1989 during an 
epidemic of maternal morbidity, 
starting a partnership that has 
helped expand access to women’s 
health care. The University now 
participates in other initiatives 
with the mission of improving 

international ob-gyn training. The 
1000+ OBGYNS project, founded 
in 2014, is working to educate 
new doctors about maternal and 
newborn health in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Also founded in 2014, 
the 
Center 
for 
International 
Reproductive Health Training 
works with 10 institutions in 
Ethiopia and one in Rwanda to 
improve reproductive health care 
education. In the future, it aims to 
extend its work to Southeast Asia.
The 
University’s 
efforts 
in Ghana and Ethiopia have 
expanded to other medical fields, 
such as emergency medicine, but 
women’s health remains a central 
focus. Johnson said Sub-Saharan 
African countries suffer from high 
rates of maternal deaths. In a joint 
email interview, CIHRT Program 
Director Lia Gebremedhin and 
CIRHT Managing Director Janet 
Hall 
added 
underprivileged 
women in these areas also lack 
safe 
abortion 
methods 
and 
contraceptives.
“Women and girls in developing 
countries 
disproportionately 
suffer from maternal morbidity 
and mortality due to unsafe 
abortion,” Gebremedhin and Hall 
wrote. “In addition, they lack 
adequate access to comprehensive 
family 
planning 
services 
to 
prevent unwanted pregnancies.”

Downtown festival 
celebrates African 
American businesses

By ROB DALKA

Daily Staff Reporter

On 
Saturday, 
the 
23rd 
annual 
African 
American 
Downtown Festival was held 
in Kerrytown on the streets 
of East Ann and North 
Fourth. Started by Lucille 
Hall-Porter, the festival is a 
celebration of African Amer-
ican culture and the local 
African 
American-owned 
businesses’ contributions to 
the community.
A grand stage was set up on 
the corner of East Ann and 
North Fourth. Live music 
and 
performances 
from 
many different groups con-
tinued throughout the day. 
Vendors lined the streets 
promoting their businesses 
and organizations, and many 
sold food, clothes, books and 
much more. These vendors 
came from Ann Arbor and 
the surrounding areas to 
share what they do with the 
people of the city. They were 
made up of both returning 
and first-time participants.
Charles Young, a Metro 
Detroit-area resident, runs a 
traveling bookstore. Charles’ 
Collectables and Books was 
among the many vendors 
that was represented at the 
festival.
“I wanted to give folks an 
opportunity to get books for 
themselves and their kids,” 
Young said. “We serve as a 
recourse for parents, teach-
ers, grandparents and any-
one who is interested in 
history.”
This year was Young’s 15th 
year bringing his bookstore 
to the AADF. He is a strong 
proponent of the festival.
“It is always a great festi-
val to come to,” Young said. 
“Ann Arbor is a great town, 
and people always come out 
and support.
Although 
the 
weather 
was cooler than earlier in 
the week, the AADF was 
warm and welcoming, with 
the smell of good food and 

sounds of vibrant music fill-
ing the air. Throughout the 
day, people from all over Ann 
Arbor and the surrounding 
communities came to enjoy 
the festival.
Mike and Kari Victor, Ann 
Arbor residents, came to 
spend some of their day at 
the AADF.
“Everybody should come 
out,” Kari Victor said. “There 
has been great entertain-
ment and food. It has been a 
ton of fun.”
The festival has grown 
each year, with this year’s 
festival being the largest 
one yet. The Ann Arbor Cul-
tural and Community Events 
Coalition works on planning 
the event all year to make the 
AADF come to fruition.
“We love that it brings 
everyone 
from 
the 
area 
together,” Teesha Montague, 
the events coordinator for 
the festival, said. “There is 
a lot of diversity. We appre-
ciate that, and we celebrate 
that. We like to celebrate our 
history at the same time.” 
Montague 
became 
the 
events coordinator in 2008 
and has helped plan the 
AADF each year since. Mon-
tague also just started a local 
business with her mother.
Ultimately, 
Montague 
hopes that the festival can 
continue to grow as the years 
go on.
“We need to extend the 
AADF,” Montague said. “We 
have been getting requests in 
the past few years, to expand 
the festival to a few days. 
Hopefully by our 25th year, 
2020, we would be able to 
that. We’ve talked with the 
city and they have totally 
supported us and we have 
appreciated that.”
Young says he is apprecia-
tive of how the community 
works together for the festi-
val.
“It’s 
a 
beautiful 
thing 
to see everybody coming 
together,” Young said. “I 
think that just seeing the 
smiles and responses is so 
satisfying and worth all the 
hard work.”

VR training helps the disabled find jobs

By RILEY LANGEFELD

Daily Staff Reporter 

Adults and children with men-
tal disabilities may soon have a 
better shot at finding jobs, thanks 
to a research project that uses vir-
tual reality job interview training 
to develop their skills.
The training has been in devel-
opment for eight years and is 
just beginning to be tested and 
applied in real-world scenarios. 
Matt Smith, an associate profes-
sor at the School of Social Work, 
joined the project in its early 
stages to help evaluate the train-
ing after a prototype was devel-
oped. Smith has been working on 
the project for seven years now, 
and its promise is only becoming 
clearer as his research continues.
At the center of the program is 
a virtual character named Molly 
Porter, who is driven by a living 
algorithm that determines her 
questions, responses and behav-
ior. The researchers refer to the 
training as the “Molly training.” 
An interview with Molly takes 
roughly 20 minutes, and trainees 
receive an overall score as well as 
eight scores for individual learn-
ing objectives when they finish. 
They use these scores to mea-
sure their progress over repeated 
interviews with Molly.
Smith and the team researched 
the effects of the Molly training 
on five disadvantaged groups, 
including those with severe 
mental illness, mood disorders, 
autism, addiction and post-trau-
matic stress disorder. In pre-
liminary testing, their subjects 
were twice as likely to get jobs 
or internships after the training 
than a control group that did not 
undergo the training.
Now, the training is being 
evaluated in four different initia-
tives with funding drawn from a 
variety of sources. One project, 
funded by the National Institute 
of Mental Health, is evaluat-
ing whether the Molly training 
is effective for adults receiving 
mental health unemployment 
services. Another, funded by 
the Kessler Foundation, focuses 
on high school students with a 

range of disabilities. These stu-
dents typically receive federally 
mandated “transition services” 
that help them in the transition 
from high school to either college 
or the workforce, and the Molly 
training could be an effective 
addition to these services.
A third project, funded by 
the NIMH and the University’s 
School of Social Work, works on 
adapting the Molly training for 
different groups of people. And 
the fourth project is funded by 
the University’s Poverty Solu-
tions initiative. Its goal is to 
evaluate the potential of working 
with Certified Peer Support Spe-
cialists on Molly training. The 
Peers, as they are called, have 
lived mental health experiences 
and received treatment, and they 
act as advocates for other individ-
uals suffering from mental health 
problems.
Smith hopes the training will 
be used with as many groups as it 
can help. He expressed his belief 
that the tool could be applied in, 
among other situations, re-entry 
services for people with prior 
criminal convictions. He suggest-
ed that the training could help to 
reduce recidivism — the tenden-
cy of a criminal to commit more 
crimes — by making it easier for 
former criminals to find jobs.
“We really want to make the 
tool accessible and evaluate if this 
tool can help other groups, too,” 
Smith said. “At the end of the day, 
job interviewing is something 
everybody has to do. Whether 
you’re somebody with a certain 
type of disability or whether 
you’re somebody that has no dis-
ability, it causes anxiety. And it’s a 
skill set that needs practice.”
Although the training is still 
in the process of being evaluated, 
its success in laboratory condi-
tions appears to have translated 
to tangible success for prelimi-
nary trainees. In their project 
to deliver the training to high 
school 
students, 
30 
percent 
found employment and 20 per-
cent found internships in the first 
four months following the train-
ing. This was consistent with the 
team’s prior research, suggest-
ing that the training could be 
immensely helpful for adults and 
young people alike.
Educators who have worked 
with the training testify to its pos-
itive impact. Meredith Schindler 
is the executive director of the 

Ann Arbor Academy, an indepen-
dent school where a third of the 
students have autism. These stu-
dents have worked started using 
the Molly training at the begin-
ning of the 2017-18 academic year.
“The 
Molly 
training 
is 
designed to help people speak 
more effectively about their abil-
ity to work well on a team — that 
they’re a hard worker,” Smith 
said. “If they’d had gaps in their 
work history, it helps them learn 
how to frame their responses in a 
positive way.”
Schindler expressed a similar 
sentiment. She noted that adults 
with mental disabilities gener-
ally make excellent employees, 
and that their primary challenge 
is getting their foot in the door 
with employers wary of hiring 
disabled people. According to 
Schindler, the Molly training has 
helped her students develop the 
skills necessary to face this chal-
lenge.
“We’ve definitely seen an 
improvement in kids’ social 
skills,” Schindler said. “And I 
think it’s definitely partially due 
to what they’re getting with the 
training. You see more confi-
dence and you see a better ability 
to handle some questions.”
Karen Steffan is the coordina-
tor of vocational services at the 
LaGrange Area Department of 
Special Education in Illinois. She 
oversees a variety of work pro-
grams for high school students 
and coordinates educational pro-
grams for around 4000 students 
with disabilities. Like Schindler, 
she has seen a marked improve-
ment in the skills of students 
using the Molly training.
“It was new to all of us,” Stef-
fan said. “We all had our learning 
curve on it. But it captures your 
interest and certainly allows you 
to stay engaged with it. … It fits in 
every environment we tested it 
in. It was convenient for people. 
It was timely for people. It was 
engaging. And it gave you imme-
diate results.”
Feedback like this is encourag-
ing for Smith and his team, who 
are hopeful about the program’s 
potential and eager to apply it 
wherever it can help. Likewise, 
for disabled people and their 
advocates, Smith’s work is a 
source of hope for the future.

OPINION

Ann Arbor, MI 48109

Edited and managed by students at 
the University of Michigan since 1890.

I 

spent this past weekend moving 
into a new house, “new” meaning 
not yet lived in by me, but old by 
all other standards. My father and I 
rolled up our sleeves and got to work, 
climbing up and down three stories, 
arms filled with boxes of oddities, 
mementos of game days and fragile 
mugs. We worked strategically and 
hastily, combining our mental and 
physical capacities to rebuild the 
deconstructed IKEA bed in the 
designated corner of my uniquely 
shaped room.
My dad taught me how to do this–
how to move. How to ready cardboard 
boxes for packing, how to use a set 
of tools, how to lift boxes from your 
knees (not your back) and how to 
declutter. I had 45 minutes a day in 
the third grade dedicated to cursive, 
another 45 to long division. In high 
school, 60 minutes a day were set aside 
for lacrosse and another generous 60 
to seeing friends. However, among 
the dance classes and math tutors, 
there was one lesson I was never 
explicitly taught, a sport for which 
I’ve never attended practice. Nobody 
has taught me how to be happy.
Intrinsically, we are inclined to 
try to find happiness ourselves. We 
all take a break from homework to 
surround ourselves with positive 
friends or music, allow ourselves 
to wander and get lost between the 
pages of a book, go for a run or stop 
for an ice cream cone just because 
it makes us happy. But when those 
tactics don’t work, I (along with many 
other college students, it seems) don’t 
know where to turn. My classmates 
and friends are often stressed and 

unhappy, riddled with anxiety and 
inclined to hide it in order to prioritize 
the coursework that needs to be 
done by tomorrow. And the day after 
tomorrow. And the day after that. 
Slowly, classes trump hobbies, and the 
things that make us happy succumb 
to the tasks that keep us enrolled in 
school; it’s hard to enjoy the pages 
you’re reading when they come with a 
looming due date or require a 10-page 
analysis. My lacrosse coach and third 
grade teacher taught me how to work 
hard but not how to be happy. Who is 
responsible for doing that now?
Colleges 
and 
universities 
nationwide 
are 
beginning 
to 
recognize this gap in education. At 
Yale University, Happiness 101 aims 
to change the culture on campus 
by 
promoting 
social 
activities, 
organizational skills and gratitude 
while pointing out detrimental habits 
like procrastination and sweeping 
emotions under the rug. Nearly a 
quarter of Yale’s undergraduate 
population enrolled in the course this 
semester, a statistic that reflects the 
need and desire for information about 
happiness and how to achieve it.
The University of Michigan is 
following this trend and joining 
Yale in offering courses designed to 
discussing happiness. For example, 
a first-year seminar offered this fall 
term called Psychology as a Social 
Science addresses what makes life 
worth living and promotes practices 
that align with a healthy and 
meaningful life. Another course, titled 
Happiness and Health: Exploring 
the Science, will hit on similar 
ideas, asking if laughter can heal us, 

if thinking positively can help us 
succeed, and how stress, depression 
and anxiety play a role in the world of 
psychology and medicine.
A big question that we must ask 
ourselves is whether we think our 
University can fill that role and 
promote a noncompetitive, grade-
independent 
well-being 
rather 
than focusing simply on academics. 
Certainly the kinks would need to be 
smoothed out and questions answered 
regarding how one would be graded 
in a U-M Happiness 101 class. But I 
believe Wolverines would welcome 
this class into the LSA Course Guide 
with open arms. Many of us prioritize 
our classes over anything else (to any 
who discredit that claim, I challenge 
you to find a table at the Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library 
on 
any 
given Sunday), meaning this week’s 
statistics lecture takes the No. 1 spot 
on our to-do list, and our hobbies and 
interests are slighted. We’ve been 
conditioned to deprioritize happiness 
in order to achieve a high grade 
point average, resulting in life habits 
that are harmful and unsustainable. 
That’s why I think that a Happiness 
101 class here at the University would 
allow us to reprioritize happiness 
along with our GPAs and forgo those 
harmful habits altogether. Given 
the competitive nature and drive for 
success that is bred at the University, 
Happiness 101 might be the only way 
to simultaneously focus on our work 
and well-being.

Confessions of a closeted Rosshole
I

t really is a daunting 
task, 
deciding 
your 
career path at the ripe 
old age of 18. It has been a 
little over a year since I found 
out I was accepted into the 
University of Michigan and 
the Ross School of Business. 
I 
remember 
thinking 
everyone knew what they 
were going to study in the 
fall. Little did I know, that 
is not true for everyone and 
many people will change 
their minds at least once, if 
not twice, in college. With so 
much excitement joining the 
U-M community, I did not 
realize it came with a whole 
new 
platform 
for 
college 
memes. The punchline for a 
lot of these jokes, however, 
involves business majors or 
– as we’re known on campus 
– Rossholes.
I’m what you might refer 
to as a “closeted” Rosshole. 
I applied to the Business 
School without any rhyme or 
reason and, to my surprise, 
was accepted. I remember 
being 
ecstatic 
until 
I 
realized the reputation that 
being in Ross carries on 
this campus. STEM majors 
scoff at you and you can’t 
exactly 
bond 
with 
other 
non-STEM majors because, 
you know, capitalism. As a 
freshman 
with 
absolutely 
no 
idea 
what 
the 
stock 
market is and an inability to 
pretend I understood how 
Wall 
Street 
worked, 
this 
was particularly confusing 
to me. What exactly is the 
stigma 
surrounding 
the 
B.B.A.? What exactly made 
me a “Rosshole?”
Honestly, to truly define 
what 
campus 
deems 
a 
Rosshole, you have to go 
to the meme pages. There, 
you can find the meaning of 
Rosshole clear as day. First, 
you have to be someone 
who incessantly talks about 
the fact that they’re in the 
Business 
School. 
Then, 
obviously, comes the Canada 
Goose jackets. Can’t be a 
true Rosshole without it. 
The overall effect is just a 
stuck-up person who will 
end up with some kind of 
fancy internship – that they 
may or may not deserve – 
doing something they don’t 
particularly understand that 

will eventually get them a 
lot of money. Kind of mind-
boggling, no?

I can totally see why the 
rest 
of 
the 
school 
hates 
business students so much. 
The building itself screams 
Rosshole with its namesake, 
Stephen M. Ross, donating 
millions 
of 
dollars 
to 
enhance the already-garish 
façade on East University 
Avenue. Meanwhile, across 
campus, other departments 
may be struggling to find 
funding. It is infuriating. It 
is, wait for it, capitalism.
With 
this 
mindset, 
I 
entered 
freshman 
year 
unwilling to divulge the fact 
that I was in the Business 
School, which, let me tell 
you, was very difficult. The 
first two questions you get 
when meeting someone new 
anywhere on this campus is, 
“What are you studying?” 
and, as a freshman, “Where 
are you living?” Both of 
these questions posed issues 
because I was in the Business 
School and living in Martha 
Cook. Both of these answers 
can garner very negative, 
albeit interesting responses. 
I learned how to explain 
away the funny looks I got 
when I said I lived in the 
all-girls dorm with a severe 
reputation by mentioning it’s 
actually a really nice place 
to live, but that’s another 
story for another time. How 
did I deal with answering 
the major question? I had 
a couple of solutions, both 
of 
which 
were 
equally

ust 
as 
ticket 
prices 
appear 
to 
impact 
the 
public’s 
opinion 
of 
women’s sports, so does the 
sports media. There is little 
to no coverage of women’s 
athletics and that leads to a 
lack of investment, interest 
and education on the part of the 
public. It becomes extremely 
difficult to generate support 
when the big inf luencers in 
sports media disregard any 
important events that happen 
in the female athletics world. 
In fact, the only time there 
is any significant coverage of 
women’s sporting events is 
during the Olympics and the 
World Cup.
This becomes more obvious 
during 
March 
Madness. 
The 
men’s 
and 
women’s 
tournaments run side by side, 
yet 
the 
men’s 
tournament 
receives 
all 
of 
the 
media 
attention. In fact, I cannot 
recall a single time during the 
tournaments when I turned on 
ESPN and they were talking 
about the women’s tournament. 
For example, Sister Jean and 
the Loyola men’s basketball 
team 
received 
an 
extreme 
amount of media attention 
and were constantly in the 
conversation while the Notre 
Dame 
women’s 
basketball 
team received no attention 
despite the fact that they beat 
the undefeated University of 
Connecticut team in the Final 
Four, and Arike Ogunbowale 
went on to hit a buzzer beater 
to win it all. Of course, the 
Loyola team and their chaplain 
deserved attention as they 
were a fantastic Cinderella 
story, but perhaps some of 
the time spent covering them 
could have been better spent 
on the women’s tournament.
As I am certain most of us 
remember, Jordan Poole hit a 
buzzer beater to beat Houston 
and send Michigan to the 
Sweet 16. That shot was highly 
publicized 
and 
everyone 
was talking about it. When 
Ogunbowale 
hit 
a 
buzzer 
beater to win it all, I don’t 
think I even saw a single video 
of it. This kind of media deficit 
is crippling to all women’s 
sports.
Another 
issue 
that 
accompanies the lack of media 
coverage is that it becomes 

very difficult to find articles 
and 
news 
about 
women’s 
sports. 
Even 
if 
someone 
is 
interested 
in 
reading 
articles and news on female 
athletics it takes at least five 
to 10 minutes of digging to 
find 
something 
interesting 
or 
relevant. 
For 
example, 
women’s sports receive only 
4 percent of all sports media 
coverage and big sources like 
SportsCenter only devoted 1 
percent of their on-air time to 
women’s athletics. It is very 
discouraging to many young 
athletes and sports fans when 
they have to go digging to find 
something that interests them.
There is already a deficit 
between interest in men’s and 

women’s sports and it certainly 
isn’t helping when you have to 
spend a bunch of time looking 
for 
something 
interesting 
about women’s sports. This 
lack of representation becomes 
a huge problem for young 
female athletes as well. With 
so little media coverage, young 
girls struggle to find role 
models in their various sports. 
It is important that young 
athletes have someone they 
can look up to and relate to 
who encourages them to keep 
going and proves to them they 
can accomplish big things. 
Because this is so absent for 
female athletes, it may make it 
harder for young girls to feel 
like it’s worth it to continue to 
pursue their athletic careers. 
This leads to a higher rate of 
young girls who stop playing 
sports 
and 
therefore 
lose 

the many benefits that come 
from playing a sport such as 
higher self-esteem, positive 
body image, and lower anxiety 
levels.
The argument has become 
that women’s sports don’t have 
a lot of media coverage because 
they are not mainstream and 
popular, but as Cheryl Reeve, 
head coach of a WNBA team, 
said, 
“The 
more 
women’s 
sports are covered, the more 
popular and mainstream, they 
will become.” I understand 
that most media outlets are 
in it for the money. They 
want to cover the events that 
bring them the most profit. 
However, they appear to be 
missing out on a huge market 
here. About half of all athletes 
are women which means that 
sports media is ignoring about 
half of their potential income.
If the media were to cover 
more 
female 
sports, 
they 
would make more money while 
simultaneously 
building 
up 
the public’s interest in female 
athletics, which would result 
in more money for them later 
on. So if we want to take the 
fact of unjustified inequality 
out of it and only consider the 
financial aspect, it seems as 
though it would make sense 
for media outlets to cover 
women’s sports far more often 
than they currently do.
All sports were unpopular 
at one point or another. It all 
comes down to exposure and 
marketing. 
Once 
women’s 
sports are given more coverage 
and the public becomes more 
exposed 
to 
the 
women’s 
sports world, these sports will 
become more popular. When 
women’s sports become more 
popular, people will become 
more educated on the topic. 
When people become more 
educated on the topic, the 
ability to close the pay gap and 
other inequalities is no longer 
an impossible task, but rather a 
goal that can be accomplished. 
When 
sports 
media 
starts 
to devote more of its time to 
female athletes, the fight for 
equality will become far less 
difficult and burdensome.

annoying 
and 
equally 
harder to deal with than if 
I had just said I was in the 
Business School. I learned 
if I asked the question first 
– bam – I could tailor my 
answer to whatever they 
said: “Oh, you’re in Ross? 
Me too!” or “Not in Ross? 
Okay then, I am in LSA and 
undecided.”
The 
whole 
“LSA 
and 
undecided” answer worked 
really well until I went to 
go fill out forms or people 
started to get more curious 
about my class schedule. 
The Business School isn’t 
part of LSA and business 
students are not undecided 
because 
they 
receive 
a 
B.B.A. Super specific, I 
know. Anyways, I would 
forget 
about 
the 
whole 
B.B.A. thing because I was so 
determined to ignore the fact 
that I was in the Business 
School. I’ll admit it, I was 
ashamed.
The first five months of 
the school year, a long time 
for a school that gets out in 
April, were awful. I treaded 
lightly when I met people, 
not knowing whether or not 
being a business student 
would 
somehow 
affect 
our 
possible 
friendship. 
Spoiler alert: it didn’t. I 
put so much emphasis on 
the negative aspect of the 
fact that I was in Ross that 
I didn’t look at the bright 
side. I’m in Ross. Some 
people would kill to be in 
my position.
I 
didn’t 
appreciate 
that until the middle of 
winter term. I think it 
had to do with the fact 
that I was in denial about 
not being a STEM major. 
The people with which I 
surround myself are all 
pre-med or some kind of 

biochemical science major 
taking organic chemistry 
their first year while I sat 
around doing ethics case 
studies. Both are super 
interesting, it’s just that, 
for a long time, I didn’t 
understand the weight of 
what I was studying, didn’t 
think it was as “academic” 
as, say, doing a chemistry 
lab.
Now, though, things are 
different. During the winter 
term, I met a lot more of my 
business peers and began 
to wonder why exactly I 
was uncomfortable telling 
people about my major. 
You don’t see biochemical 
students 
rushing 
to 
cover up their scientific 
endeavors, 
nor 
do 
you 
ever 
hear 
international 
studies students gloss over 
interests 
in 
the 
world. 
So, why should I hide my 
interest in business? The 
answer was I shouldn’t. 
The 
opportunities 
that 
a 
well-earned 
business 
degree can provide are 
infinite and the subjects 
within it are nuanced and 
applicable.
I 
think 
one 
of 
the 
biggest reasons I didn’t 
feel comfortable with my 
standing in the Business 
School was that I have no 
idea what I want to do with 
my life. Do I want to go into 
health-care? Do I want 
to manage a hedge fund? 
Do I want to somehow do 
both? 
These 
questions 
continue 
to 
plague 
me, 
but a business degree is at 
least start in some kind of 
direction. So, yeah, maybe 
I am a Rosshole after all.

I lingered in the Michigan 
Theater’s main auditorium last 
Thursday 
after 
the 
screening 
of 
Bo 
Burnham’s 
directorial 
debut, “Eighth Grade.” A crowd 
of teenagers, young adults and 
retirees had just finished giving 
Burnham a standing ovation after 
his short Q&A and were now 
streaming out the back of the 
theater while I fought to make my 
way to the front. Not a seat in the 
theater had been empty that night. 
The movie, which marked the 
beginning of the Cinetopia Film 
Festival, had sold out earlier that 
day — and for good reason. 
“Eighth Grade” is a continuation 
of movies like “Lady Bird” and 
“Call Me By Your Name.” While 
they’re not all explicitly similar in 
genre or plot, they evoke a similar 
feeling from their audiences — 
something like nostalgia, but not 
quite, and like nervousness, but 
more trepid. These films zero 
in on the familiar and universal 
experiences of growing up and 
falling in love, while skillfully 
retaining 
the 
autonomy 
and 
individuality of their characters.
“Lady Bird” and “CMBYN” 
fit nicely into the coming-of-age 
category of films, but “Eighth 
Grade” 
narrowly 
avoids 
this 
label. While the movie introduces 
an 
expectedly 
coming-of-age 
abstract — Kayla (Elsie Fisher, 
“Despicable Me”) is a shy middle 
schooler entering her last week 

of eighth grade who decides to 
put herself out there before the 
school year ends — the entire 
movie 
is 
undercut 
by 
larger 
anxieties concerning technology, 
social media and problems beyond 
Kayla’s impending high school 
career.
Burnham, who got his start in 
comedy by making Youtube videos 
filmed in his childhood bedroom, 
has always had these concerns 
on his mind. Much of his standup 
challenges our expectations of 
technology and tries to illustrate 
the 
complex 
relationship 
our 
generation 
has 
with 
it. 
“I’m 
addicted to the internet too,” 
Burnham conceded during the 
Q&A after the screening, but that 
doesn’t mean he still doesn’t share 
the anxieties we all do, especially 
when looking at the effect it could 
have on younger generations.
“There 
is 
a 
much 
subtler 
conversation to be had about 
the internet beyond Russia and 
cyberbullying, 
something 
very 
personal 
and 
interior 
to 
the 
internet and what it does to people 
that is not okay,” said Burnham 
earlier that night in response to an 
audience member’s question about 
this aspect of the film. “There’s 
this sudden impulse to see yourself 
as a commodity or a character. To 
sort of float above your life and 
watch other people watch you 
and watch other people watch you 
watch them.”
Much 
of 
“Eighth 
Grade” 
concerns this kind of watching. 
Kayla aimlessly scrolls through 

her Instagram feed, liking pictures 
and videos of other 13 year olds 
pulling pranks and painting their 
nails. She makes videos with 
survival guide tips on how to be 
more confident, while suffering 
from crippling shyness in her day-
to-day life. She wants to be seen 
as someone she’s not, an expert on 
relationships and “Being Yourself.” 
Access to Instagram and Youtube 
makes this very easy for her to do. 
Kayla’s the eighth grader most of 
us were: awkward and introverted 
with acne-prone skin. But unlike 
us, she can hide this under 
Snapchat filters and good lighting.
Making my way to the front 
of the Michigan Theater under 
the massive chandelier, swarms 
of people moving in the opposite 
direction of me stared. I found 
Burnham’s representative, who I 
was directed to in an email, and 
taken backstage to wait for him 
to finish up another interview. As 
I waited, no matter who I talked 
to, be it Ella, the A24 publicist 
traveling 
with 
Burnham 
on 
the tour or a 68-year-old male 
Michigan 
Theater 
employee, 
everyone’s reactions stuck on the 
same point: The universality of 
a 13-year-old girl’s last week of 
middle school and her efforts to 
woo the cool kids in school.
“What’s the score?” Burnham 
asked Ella as we walked down 
the narrow hallway towards the 
dressing room. He was referring 
to the Cavs and Warriors game 
taking place that night, and I was 
immediately 
worried 
I 
would 
have to make small talk about 
basketball, a subject far from my 
specialty. But Burnham barely 
acknowledged this pause before 
sitting down next to me. He had 
been answering questions all day; 
it was 10:45 p.m. and he admittedly 
looked tired.
A 
question 
many 
people 
have fixated on in relation to 
“Eighth Grade” is how Burnham 
managed to perfectly capture the 
experiences of a 13-year-old girl 
without basing it off himself or 
someone else. Multiple years of 
touring has exposed him to the 
age demographic he was trying to 
paint a picture of but, as he pointed 
out, anything we need to know 
about middle schoolers these days 
is right at our fingertips. They put 
everything online to be seen.
“I 
think 
it 
would’ve 
been 
different if it had been sort of 
polluted by like ‘Oh this is my 
little cousin or my friend’s sister,’” 
Burnham responded when I asked 
how he managed to draw such 
a perfect portrait. “When I was 

writing it, it felt like someone I 
knew, but it wasn’t specific.” This 
is how he avoided the nostalgia 
trap this film could’ve easily 
become. He was chasing a feeling, 
not nonfiction.
“I just wanted to do an intense 
movie about being this person, not 
what it means to be a kid always 
throughout all of time. I was 
feeling very nervous and panicked 
and anxious on the internet, and 
I was looking at the internet and 
meeting people, and I saw all these 
people also feeling very nervous 
and panicked in their lives too. So 
I wanted to explore what it felt like 
to feel anxious, to feel …” Burnham 
paused here, thinking. “Anxious is 
the opposite of nostalgic. It’s the 
opposite of distance at least. You’re 
locked in it and you can’t really 
see outside of yourself. So it was 
important that the movie didn’t 
see outside of her. I didn’t want the 
movie to know any more than she 
did.”
It’s terrifying to think that 
the common thread from one 
generation to the next is anxiety, 
but the internet undeniably doles 
out this feeling of uneasiness 
from one user to the next. And 
all the details of the film lend 
themselves to creating this feeling 
of uneasiness, but also the feeling 
that we are in Kayla’s world where 
every look, word and wink is a life 
or death situation. The audience 
truly doesn’t see outside of Kayla 
as Anne Meredith’s EDM score 
ropes us into the film, dropping 
a hard-hitting bass drop when 
Fisher’s character sees her crush 
for the first time or confronts the 
mean girl in school.
As far as influences go, Burnham 
didn’t have any but the faces he’s 
come across in life and online. But 
there’s something to be said about 
how the experience of 27-year-old 
Burnham can be easily translated 
to 13-year-old Kayla or 20-year-old 
me. Why did he think that is the 
case? I wondered, and then I asked, 
“What do you think it is about the 
internet that allows you to write 
convincingly from the point of 
view of a 13-year-old and not have 
the audience bat an eye?”
“I think the culture at the 
moment is existing on an eighth-
grade level, you know what I 
mean?” Burnham replied. “The 
national conversation is taking 
place at an eighth-grade level, our 
president has like an eighth-grade 
reading level. So it just feels very 
true to me. I think the internet 
makes eighth graders of us all.”
What struck me about this 
conversation 
with 
Burnham, 

and replies like these, was the 
concern and anxiety seeping into 
his voice as he talked about these 
topics, and how starkly it contrasts 
from the Burnham confined to 
Netflix specials and computer 
screens. While his standup drips 
with vitriol and is known for 
its dramatic flare, this movie is 
entirely different. It’s smart and 
clever and honest, tackles similar 
subject matters as “what.” and 
“Make Happy,” but isn’t the least 
bit arrogant or pretentious.
As Burnham put it, this movie 
is truer to who he is. “I am not 
naturally 
that 
pyrotechnic, 
overridden, cynical thing. It’s 
what the medium called for … 
and the truth was I was onstage 
terrified every night.” Making the 
move from irony to sincerity for 
Burnham was “freeing.” “It was 
natural. It felt more like dropping 
things like finally I can drop all 
these tools. I’m so excited to finally 
do something that isn’t ironic, isn’t 
satirical.”
When we’re children, we just 
want adults to recognize the 
magnitude of our situation. “Eighth 
Grade” captures the life and death 
feeling attached to being 13 years 
old. Between the music, Elsie 
Fisher’s 
fantastic 
performance 
and Burnham’s attention to the 
most minute details, the audience 
was dragged into this feeling 
and left laughing, squirming and 
occasionally shielding their eyes, 
unable to stand the familiarity of 
it.
“I didn’t want to make a 
nostalgic movie,” Burnham said 
during the theater’s Q&A session. 
“I wanted to know about what it’s 
like to be young now. I watched 
hundreds of videos of kids online 
talking about their own life and the 
boys talked about Minecraft, and 
the girls talked about their souls.”
I don’t think Burnham made a 
nostalgic movie. It’s difficult to feel 
nostalgic about such a confusing, 
anxious, hormonal time in one’s 
life. But he did make a reflective 
movie, an honest one. He made 
a movie that triggers feelings of 
anxiety and terror as we feel them 
in eighth grade and now on a larger 
scale. As Burnham put it, “sweeping 
decisions about the future of our 
brain’s neurochemistry are being 
made by nine guys with no social 
skills in Silicon Valley.” And while 
being a girl in eighth grade is a 
common experience among many, 
these sweeping decisions make 
every 
generation’s 
experience 
in middle school more and more 
unknowable.

At risk of sounding nostalgic, I 
don’t know if there’s anything better 
in life than re-living a seemingly 
perfect memory.
Your mind might wander to 
that familiar place, or the feeling 
is unwittingly triggered, or you 
consciously recall it. Either way, 
for several fleeting seconds, our 
brain is entirely consumed with 
the 
unmatched 
sights, 
sounds 
and emotions of that memory. 
Everything is bathed in a warm, 
goldish hue and all seems well in the 
world.
And then we’re violently and 
unceremoniously thrown back into 
reality. It’s almost like a cruel joke, 
as if our minds are teasing us with 
a reminder of a world that once was.
But what if we could stay in that 
space for longer? We’d probably do 
anything to achieve that, right?
These questions lie at the heart 
of 
NBC’s 
thought-provoking 
new series, “Reverie.” Drawing 
inspiration from sci-fi concepts 
lately popularized in “Black Mirror” 
and 
“Westworld,” 
“Reverie” 
examines 
the 
delicate 
balance 
between immersive virtual reality 
and reality.
In the show, emerging virtual 
reality company Onira Tech, led by 
virtuoso programmer Alexis Barrett 
(Jessica 
Lu, 
“Awkward.”), 
has 
developed an application dubbed 
Reverie that “allows two people 
to interact in a shared, immersive 
virtual world” indistinguishable 
from reality.
Although 
the 
clear 
benefits 
of 
Reverie 
— 
namely, 
letting 
individuals 
relive 
experiences 
with family or friends who have 
passed away — are enormous, the 

drawbacks of the program are just 
as glaring and severe.
As “Reverie” somewhat clumsily 
outlines 
in 
its 
premiere, 
it’s 
becoming increasingly common for 
users to remain in the program for 
weeks at a time and fall into a coma 
in reality due to the intoxicating 
nature of their memories. At the 
expense of their sanity, “the dream 
has become their reality.”
To alleviate this issue, Onira 
brings in behavioral psychologist 
Mara Kint (Sarah Shahi, “Person of 
Interest”), who previously worked 
as a hostage negotiator alongside 
the 
firm’s 
security 
consultant, 
Charlie Ventana (Dennis Haysbert, 

“24”). Kint is tasked with entering 
programs and persuading users to 
leave Reverie in favor of the real 
world.
While this concept is clearly 
influenced by (read: ripped from) 
Christopher Nolan’s psychological 
thriller “Inception,” it remains 
an 
intriguing 
exploration 
of 
human relationships and prompts 
existential 
questions 
about 
happiness. These questions are 
the series’ greatest contributions, 
challenging viewers to consider 
their past and confront whether they 
would trade the rest of their lives 
for a few euphoric, yet ephemeral, 
moments.
Beyond 
its 
philosophical 
ponderings, “Reverie” features a 
strong performance from Shahi, 
who manages to add layers to her 
cliché backstory as someone driven 
by witnessing personal tragedy. 
Shahi brings a level of intrigue and 

charisma to the series that produces 
a complex and somewhat enigmatic 
Kint.
While Shahi’s co-stars are not 
as adept at deepening their roles, 
Haysbert — the trademark gravelly 
voice of Allstate commercials — is 
convincing as a conflicted Reverie 
staffer grappling with the mental 
weight of the program’s implications 
for reality. Playing Onira’s chief 
scientist, 
Sendhil 
Ramamurthy 
(“Heroes”) does a nice job of 
providing some comic relief, though 
Lu disappoints as the completely 
forgettable creator of Reverie.
Although its cast is a mixed bag, 
the visuals of “Reverie” are entirely 
the 
opposite. 
Throughout 
the 
show’s pilot, Reverie’s virtual world 
is treated to a brighter, enhanced 
color palette that reflects the warm 
hue which envelops our mind when 
reliving fond memories.
“Reverie” excels at portraying 
a virtual utopia, making it easier 
for audiences to empathize with 
users who elect to stay in its 
confines rather than return to 
reality. The show contrasts the 
friendly, inviting colorways of the 
simulation with a more sleek and 
minimalist coloring for its scenes 
depicting the real world. Consisting 
primarily of varying shades of 
grey, blue and black, the series’s 
color palette for reality is intended 
to subtly encourage viewers to 
further question whether Reverie 
as an application represents a better 
alternative.
It’s 
in 
these 
methodical, 
thoughtful decisions that “Reverie” 
overcomes its struggling cast and 
occasionally heavy-handed writing 
to emerge as an engaging and 
introspective look at the power of 
the past. Let’s hope there’s more of 
it on the way.

‘Reverie’ is a provocative 
dive into virtual reality

“Arrested 
Development”

Netflix

Season 5

When it was brought back to 
small screens everywhere in 2013, 
“Arrested Development” was the 
first major series to be revived by a 
streaming service. It was a big deal. 
It was in the early days of Netflix 
originals and before shows like 
“Brooklyn 99” could be saved within 
hours of their cancellation. It was 
also very different from the first 
three seasons of the show, which 
originally aired on Fox from 2003 
to 2006, breaking up the bungling 
Bluth family into character centric 
episodes that came together by the 
season’s end. It was darker than the 
original series and it pushed the 
characters to places they had never 
gone before. It was also savaged by 
critics and most general audiences, 
with only the hardest of the hardcore 
fans seeming to enjoy it. Now, five 
years later, comes season five.
At first glance, season five seems 
to function as a direct response to the 
reception of season four, with more 
scenes that feature the entire family 
and most characters appearing in 
every episode. Dig a little deeper 
though and the cracks begin to show. 
Almost right off the bat the new 
batch of episodes fails to capitalize on 
the two most promising cliffhangers 
left hanging five years ago, the 
disappearance of Liza Menilli’s 
Lucille II and the congressional race 
between longtime enemies Lindsey 
Bluth (Portia De Rossi, “Scandal”) 
and Sally Sitwell (Christine Taylor, 
“Zoolander 2”).
Back in 2013, it seemed obvious 
that series creator Mitch Hurwitz 
was setting up some 
kind 
of 
murder 
mystery 
involving 
Lucille 
II, 
with 
practically 
every 
member of the Bluth 
family 
potentially 
implicated 
in 
the 
crime. Sadly this storyline barely 
simmers in this first half the new 
season (the rest will come sometime 
later this year). The election storyline 
is marred down by two main issues, 
one of which is the basic absence 
of De Rossi from the show, which 
renders the plotline toothless, and 
the other is the fact that and election 
storyline involving a candidate 
advocating for a wall now feels 

incredibly played out.
It’s hard to judge these first 
eight episodes in isolation without 
knowing how it all pans out in 
the second half. They certainly 
don’t stand on their own. The only 
characters who truly shine are the 
now grown up George Michael 
(Michael Cera, “Molly’s Game”) 
and Maeby (Alia Shawkat, “The 
Intervention”), who are the only 
members of the Bluth family who 
can offer up new things that we 
haven’t seen before. Will Arnett’s 
GOB has a potentially emotionally 
resonant story about struggling to 
come out of the closet, but the almost 
complete absence of his counterpart 
Tony Wonder (Ben Stiller, “Brad’s 
Status”) again causes his storyline to 
feel incomplete.
In general the new season feels 
strangely barren. Unlike the first 
four seasons, which were in different 
ways crammed to the gills with jokes 
and guest stars and enough plot for 
episodes double their length, season 
five feels devoid of content, as if they 
had to stretch out a few episodes 
worth of story to fill the entire 
season. Even more so than season 
four, it doesn’t feel like “Arrested 
Development” and with so many 
important characters and actors 
either missing or barely appearing, 
it seriously begs the question if it’s 
worth it to keep moving forward.
The show no longer knows what 
it is about or what story it is trying 
to tell. Back in 2013 Mitch Hurwitz 
claimed he had a three act story 
planned out, of which season four 
was act one and a forthcoming 
“Arrested” movie would be acts two 
and three. It seems unlikely that this 
version of season five 
is even remotely close 
to what he originally 
had planned for the 
movie and it seems 
doubly unlikely that 
another five year wait 
for season six will 
result in anything worthwhile. This 
is besides the fact that off-screen 
problems now mob the cast and key 
actors are aging faster than the show 
can keep up. It was once said “there’s 
always money in the banana stand.” 
In this half season of a once-iconic 
series, the banana stand is gone, the 
money is nowhere to be found and 
the magic that once made this series 
great seems to be gone with it. 

Season five of 
‘Arrested’ loses

Voices of Hong Kong, Rise Up 

When I was younger, the 
modern history of China, 
or the People’s Republic of 
China, including the 1989 
democracy movement and 
Tiananmen Square mas-
sacre, was briefly taught 
in schools in Hong Kong. 
My curiosity about this 
taboo history of China 
was sparked, so I casu-
ally brought it up in front 
of my parents. When I 
asked them about it, little 
did I know it was a sensi-
tive topic for my parents, 
as they experienced the 
‘89 democracy movement 
in Hong Kong when they 
were teenagers.
They looked at me flus-
tered, paused for a second 
and said, “Son, personal 
liberty, 
and 
democracy 
in China were basically 
nonexistent after June 4, 
1989. Even though we are 
privileged enough to have 
limited personal freedom 
and liberty in Hong Kong, 
it is still dangerous to get 
involved in Chinese or 
Hong Kong politics. The 
less you know, the better.” 
Since 
talking 
about 
these experiences could 
be difficult for my par-
ents, I tried to avoid asking 
them about it any further. 
However, 
my 
curiosity 
about their experiences of 
the movement had only 
grown since then. Espe-
cially on anniversaries of 
the Tiananmen massacre, 
I sometimes could not 
help but make comments 
like, “I wonder what the 
‘89 democracy movement 
experience was like.” My 
dad would respond by put-
ting on his straight face 
and telling me, “Son, go 
study for your classes or do 
something more produc-
tive. What are you gonna 
gain from learning about 
the movement? No one can 
change China.”
Fast forward to high 
school, when I became 
more 
knowledgeable. 
I 

cared even more about 
China and Hong Kong poli-
tics. Seeing how passion-
ate I was, my mom finally 
opened up to me about her 
experiences as a teenager.
“I still vividly remember 
seeing a million Hong Kong 
people filling up the streets 
protesting that night. It 
was pouring rain because 
a massive hurricane was 
striking Hong Kong, but 
that did not stop us from 
speaking up for what we 
believed in. It was probably 
the most powerful thing I 
have seen in my life.”
In 1989, thousands of 
Chinese college students 
and educators stood in 
front of the Beijing Capi-
tol building in Tianan-
men Square, demanding 
democracy 
and 
politi-
cal reform in China. The 
’89 democracy movement 
lasted for two months and 
soon spread throughout 
China to major cities such 
as 
Nanjing, 
Guangzhou 
and British Hong Kong 
with a turnout of millions 
of people. It even sparked 
protests in Taiwan eventu-
ally. Everyone, including 
my parents, was so hope-
ful for political reform and 
ultimately democracy in 
China. However, June 4, 
1989 marked the downfall 
of social progression and 
democracy in China. The 
Chinese government used 
military forces such as 
automatic rifles and tanks 
to kill hundreds of students 
in Tiananmen Square to 
stop the movement from 
advancing. The shunning 
of social progression then 
led to Chinese diaspora 
and ultimately the silenc-
ing of anti-China voices, 
which is why it was a diffi-
cult experience for my par-
ents and why they always 
remind me to be careful of 
my words and actions in 
regards to China.
As a Hong Kong citi-
zen, this piece of history 
is extremely valuable and 
prevalent 
to 
me. 
Since 
Hong Kong and Macau 

are 
the 
most 
socially 
advanced places in China 
due to democratic influ-
ences under Western col-
onization, our freedom 
allows us to preserve and 
discuss the truth of taboo 
events in China like the 
Tiananmen massacre and 
the May Fourth Move-
ment. Even though I never 
personally 
experienced 
the movement, the politi-
cal impact of the tragedy 
of Tiananmen massacre 
is, however, readily visible 
in the democracy of Hong 
Kong and Macau today. 
It enrages me to see my 
people’s culture, person-
al liberties and freedom 
of speech slowly being 
limited by China as the 
Communist 
government 
attempts to Sinicize Hong 
Kong and Macau politi-
cally and culturally so that 
China can silence the truth 
and assert its dominance. 
Likewise, it is outrageous 
to see the way Taiwan is 
being suppressed interna-
tionally and Sinicized by 
China, despite the fact that 
Taiwan is a state that func-
tions independently from 
China. With the privilege 
of having personal liberty 
and freedom living in the 
United States, I almost see 
it as an obligation for me to 
speak out against China’s 
oppression for myself, my 
people back in Hong Kong 
and other oppressed indi-
viduals. That said, I hope 
my fellow Chinese Ameri-
cans, Hong Kong Ameri-
cans, Macau Americans 
and Taiwanese Americans 
will be eager to learn more 
about the effects of the 
events in China’s modern 
history like the ’89 democ-
racy movement and can 
become advocates of our 
parents’ narratives as well.
Rest in Peace to all 
the 
courageous 
col-
lege students, educators, 
and activists who were 
silenced and killed during 
the ’89 democracy move-
ment. Your social impact 
shall never be forgotten.

A TV show all about 
trying to survive as a Black 
student at a predominant-
ly white university? The 
narrative is pretty familiar 
to me, and unfortunately, 
some of the storylines 
are not that exaggerated. 
Proving statistics against 
the 
Black 
community 
wrong by getting a degree 
at a prestigious university 
while keeping mentally 
stable is something that 
many of us have to deal 
with, and this is the first 
time I’ve seen this perspec-
tive 
largely 
publicized. 
With a hooking name that 
received massive backlash 
from audiences, a provoca-
tive storyline and relevant 
issues; let’s talk about the 
importance of this Netflix 
Original. 
From the jump, I was 
surprised by the sheer 
unapologetic premise of 
the show. With some-
thing as touchy as racial 
tensions, 
I 
think 
that 
both seasons did a great 
job incorporating satire 
and important issues into 
every episode. With a play 
on many of the different 
perspectives that are never 
shown for black charac-
ters on shows, such as the 
nerdy journalist (Lionel 
Higgins), the activist (Sam 
White), and the ambitious 
girl on campus (Coco Con-

ners) this is one of the first 
shows I had seen in a long 
time with such depth and 
diversity for black charac-
ters. Not to mention, that 
Dear White People also 
did a great job tieing in 
other identities such as the 
LGBTQ community and 
African identity within 
their storylines. Dedicat-
ing plot sequences and 
episodes to the growth of 
Lionel’s sexuality, from 
being shy about telling his 
roommate Troy that he’s 
gay, to publicly making 
out with his head writer 
in the season one finale. 
Also giving time to Coco’s 
roommate, Nia, a lesbian 
from Trinidad to explain 
the rich pride of her heri-
tage and attending college 
far away from her home. 
Often times, TV can gloss 
over Black characters and 
make us into the submis-
sive secretaries, butlers 
or the underrepresented 
friend in a group of people. 
This show threw all of 
those tropes into the trash 
and I loved every second 
of it. 
Now let’s talk about the 
issues that arise while the 
characters are on campus. 
From season one’s “Black-
Face Party” to Sam’s white 
boyfriend calling the cops, 
and the scene escalating to 
Reggie getting a gun from 
a cop pulled out on him, I 
was shook. Besides having 
experienced the blatant 

racism that many Black 
Students face on campus, 
the way in which Reggie 
handles his emotions after 
the event also deeply reso-
nated with me. Season two 
begins with him having to 
attend therapy by request 
of Troy’s father, the head 
dean. For many in the 
Black community, mental 
health is a touchy subject, 
and I think the show did an 
excellent job reaching into 
this piece of Reggie’s char-
acter. Infusing the taboo 
nature of therapy with a 
police officer pulling a gun 
on Reggie is what creates 
hurdles for his character 
but also reminds the audi-
ence that for many, these 
situations are not just new 
headlines and rallies, they 
are issues that many char-
acters face trying to prog-
ress in a world that holds 
deep-rooted prejudice. 
Dear 
White 
People 
addressed the issues that 
I, being a Black college stu-
dent have faced as well as 
have seen within my own 
community. 
There 
are 
plenty of topics that Dear 
White People discussed 
that I did not touch on in 
this article as well as issues 
that are yet to appear in an 
episode. Despite this, I still 
immensely enjoyed being 
able to see the Black com-
munity on screen and with 
the pressure put on this 
show to accomplish such 
tasks, it did a good job.

SPORTS

To put it bluntly, the bookends of 
the Michigan baseball team’s season 
were a disaster.
The Wolverines started their 
season 4-11, a mark they won’t soon 
forget, and ended it 2-7. However, 
in the middle portion, Michigan 
found itself successful in amassing a 
20-game win streak.
In a rebuilding season, the 
Wolverines faced almost everything 
you can experience in baseball. 
From heartbreaking defeats to 
walk-off wins, Michigan and its 
young core was there through it 
all and gained a crucial element 
that can’t be found in any statbook: 
experience.
Heading into the season, the 
hope was that the Wolverines could 
fill the vacancies left by their 15 
departing juniors and seniors with 
fresh, young talent and avoid the 
pangs of rebuilding. After a long 
recruiting season, Michigan was 
poised to do just that. It acquired 
the 10th-ranked recruiting class in 
the nation, good for the best batch 
of incoming freshman in the history 
of the Big Ten. But to whom much is 
given, much is expected.
And after a long road trip to begin 
the season posited the Wolverines at 
4-11, a large cloud of disappointment 
loomed large over Ray Fisher 
Stadium.
“We’d like to think that coming 
into this season that we’ve put 
ourselves into a position to reload 
and 
not 
rebuild, 
but 
clearly 
we’re rebuilding right now,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich after 
a series loss to Lipscomb. “We’ll 
see how we progress from here, 
but so far this has been nothing but 
disappointment.”
Then, it was as if someone 
flipped a switch. The Wolverines 
began winning at an unparalleled 
rate, and the freshmen adapted to 
college ball. The young guys began 
showing what they were capable of: 
cementing their legacy at Michigan.
Frequently contributing to the 
Wolverines’ game on a daily basis 
were slugger Jesse Franklin, left-
hander Ben Dragani, left fielder 
Jordan Nwogu, shortstop Jack 
Blomgren and right-hander Jeff 
Criswell.
Franklin led the team with 10 
home runs, and Dragani worked 
his way into the weekend starting 
rotation highlighted by a 2.76 ERA 
and a 6-2 record—all impressive 

stats for any college baseball player, 
let alone one in his first season.
Supporting 
and 
mentoring 
the freshmen throughout their 
inaugural season were the juniors 
and seniors in the the Wolverine 
dugout.
“The future is really bright,” 
said junior center fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann. “As you can tell, we had 
a lot of younger guys contributing on 
a day-to-day basis, and it’s inspiring 
to the older guys too. This is a team 
where it’s good to be in a mentorship 
role, but I feel like I learn as much 
from them as I’ve taught them.”
Added Bakich: “What I’ll take 
away (from this team) is that the 
older guys, the guys that have 
evolved into leadership roles, like 
(senior catcher Brock Keener) 
and Engelmann and others, they 
just didn’t let the team go in the 
wrong direction when so many 
teams could’ve just said, ‘This is a 
rebuilding year and it’s a bad year.’ 
And we were clearly heading in that 
direction.”
Seeing that resolve in the older 
guys will be monumental going 
forward. It’s one thing to merely 
develop your physical tools as an 
athlete, but completely something 
else to experience true team 
cohesion and mental toughness. In 
a sport where failure is abundant, 
the strength of one’s character 
is determined by their ability to 
overcome rather than their success 
in the scorebook. If this season is any 
indication, the freshmen’s character 
is as strong as its ranking suggests.
Besides grit and resilience, the 
freshmen have also learned, and will 
continue to learn, the importance 
of representing the block-M well. 
Michigan and championships are 
synonymous, so the more a player 
wears a maize and blue jersey, the 
more they understand the weight it 
carries.
“I hope more than anything that 
they understand the significance of 
playing for Michigan,” Engelmann 
said. “That above all is the most 
important 
thing. 
Wearing 
the 
block-M over your jersey, that’s 
the main thing that I think is the 
most important, and I hope that’s 
the most important thing they’ve 
learned this year.”
Looking back, the Wolverine 
faithful will debate whether this 
season was a failure or success. 
In many ways it was both, but 
regardless of how you feel, one thing 
is certain: a strong foundation has 
been laid for the future.

Eight Wolverines qualify for NCAA 

After losing to Notre Dame 
2-1, the Michigan softball team 
(43-13 overall,18-3 Big Ten) saw 
its season come to an end in the 
NCAA Regionals.
For much of this season, it 
seemed like the Wolverines’ 
early exit in the 2017 NCAA 
Tournament was a fluke. The 
Wolverines reclaimed the Big 
Ten regular season title, put 
together multiple 15-plus game 
win streaks, and statistically 
had one of the most dominant 
pitching staffs and defenses in 
the country.
The warning signs, though, 
were real. Throughout the season, 
Michigan failed to capitalize 
with runners in scoring position 
— especially when it mattered 
most. Against the Fighting Irish, 
that trend that came back to bite 
it. Despite a dominant stretch 
in the middle of the season, the 
Wolverines saw blowout losses 
to Western Michigan and Ohio 
State at home nearing the end of 
the season.
By the time Michigan State 
eliminated 
Michigan 
in 
the 
second round of the Big Ten 
Tournament, its fate seemed 
all but sealed. The Wolverines 
narrowly missed out on hosting 
an NCAA Regionals group, and 
Michigan’s momentum — and 
more importantly, its confidence 
— was all gone.
The Daily breaks down the 
highlights of the 2018 softball 

season, and ultimately where 
Michigan and head coach Carol 
Hutchins might go from here.
Most 
Valuable 
Player: 
Meghan 
Beaubien, 
freshman, 
pitcher
Most 
freshmen 
don’t 
just 
walk into a softball program like 
Michigan’s and get the proverbial 
keys to the Ferrari, but the left 
hander made it clear right away 
that she was no ordinary rookie, 
leading the NCAA in wins with 
a 33-6 record and compiling a 
1.16 earned-run averaged. In her 
first collegiate start, Beaubien 
tossed a six-inning no-hitter and 
proceeded to accomplish that 
feat two more times. As a result 
of her early heroics, Hutchins 
wasn’t afraid to make Beaubien 
the workhorse of the rotation, 
putting the left hander in for 
217.0 innings pitched, over 100 
more innings than the next 
closest pitcher.
It didn’t take long for Beaubien 
to gain national recognition, 
either. The left hander notched 
countless Big Ten Pitcher of 
the Week awards and ended 
the season as one of only three 
freshman finalists for the USA 
Softball Collegiate Player of 
the Year award. For a team that 
needed an ace after Megan Betsa 
graduated, Beaubien fit the bill. 
She’s well on the path to becoming 
the next great Wolverine pitcher.
Honorable Mention: Faith 
Canfield, junior, second baseman
Breakout Player: Madison 
Uden, sophomore, third base
After only seeing 47 at-bats 

all of last season, Uden initially 
struggled — hitting just .186 
through her first thirteen games 
as the starting third baseman. 
But as the season progressed, 
the sophomore morphed into 
one of the teams most consistent 
hitters, finishing second on the 
team in batting average (.357) and 
on-base percentage (.448), and 
third in runs batted in (35).
One of the areas where Uden 
improved considerably was her 
plate discipline. In the offseason, 
the third baseman did extensive 
vision training to process pitches 
more quickly and efficiently and 
has since become a key cog as 
the fifth hitter in the Michigan 
lineup. 
When 
Uden 
earned 
a walk-off walk against Ball 
State, Hutchins summed up the 
sophomore’s improvement best.
“Last year’s Maddie might 
have torn herself out of the 
at-bat,” Hutchins said. “I think 
she’s matured. I think she’s 
done a nice job of staying within 
herself.
If Uden can continue to 
maintain that calmness and 
maturity 
at 
the 
plate, 
the 
Wolverines can safely plug her 
into the lineup and not worry 
about third base for the next two 
years.
Honorable Mention: Natalia 
Rodriguez, freshman, shortstop
Best Moment: Michigan beats 
Ohio State 8-0 to clinch the Big

The Michigan baseball team faced almost everything possible on a baseball field from walk-off wins to brutal losses this season
Michigan baseball season in reivew

Coming off the back of a second 
NCAA Tournament appearance in 
three years and their first 40-win season 
since 2008, head coach Erik Bakich 
and the Michigan baseball team were 
looking to build on their successful 2017 
season with an even better campaign 
in 2018. The Wolverines lost 11 players 
from that 2017 team to the majors — 15 
in all — but welcomed a recruiting class 
— ranked tenth nationally — of 13.
However, 
the 
optimism 
that 
accompanied Team #152 into the season 
quickly turned sour. A combination of 
returning starters not performing well 
enough and freshmen struggling to 
make an impact saw Michigan lose 11 of 
its first 15 games. This run was capped 
off by a humiliating 3-8 loss to NAIA 
program Lawrence Tech.
A switch was flipped following the 
loss, though. The Wolverines rattled off 
20 consecutive wins and became one 
of the hottest teams in college baseball. 
There was a newfound positivity in the 
dugout, and both upperclassmen and 
freshmen were benefiting from it on the 
field.
A loss to Iowa ended their streak and 
seemed to phase the youthful Michigan 
team. Like earlier in the season, it was 
knocked off its pedestal and ended the 
regular season with a dissapointing 8-7 
record in which all seven losses came to 
Big Ten opponents.
The Wolverines entered the Big Ten 
tournament in a bit of a rut and weren’t 
able to shake it. Although they won their 
first game 2-1 against Iowa in extra 
innings, they came up just short in the 

next two games to Purdue and Ohio 
State, respectively. Their inability to 
move on in Omaha ultimately cost them 
a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
The 2018 season was a rollercoaster 
for the Michigan baseball team. The 
Wolverines finished 33-21, 6.5 games 
behind last year’s mark. They flashed 
boundless potential at times and 
exhibited inconsistency at other times. 
The Daily reflects on the 2018 season 
and looks ahead to the 2019 team.
Most Valuable Player: Jonathan 
Engelmann
On a team full of freshmen and 
sophomores, 
junior 
centerfielder 
Jonathan Engelmann was a much-
needed leader. The All-Big Ten First 
Team Selection isn’t necessarily the 
most boisterous guy on the field, but 
the uber-mature Engelmann led by 
example and was a major reason why 
this Michigan team was as successful 
as it was.
Offensively, he did it all this season. 
He was second on the team with a .351 
batting average, led the team in hits, 
total bases and doubles and was second 
only to freshmen slugger Jesse Franklin 
in home runs and RBIs. Additionally, he 
was a defensive pillar out in centerfield, 
registering a .974 fielding percentage 
and only two errors.
His likely return to Ann Arbor for 
his senior season is one of the many 
reasons to be optimistic about the 2019 
Wolverines.
Breakout Player: Jesse Franklin
Like most freshmen on the team, 
Franklin struggled to adapt to the 
college game early on. After playing 
in his first nine games, five of which 
he started, Franklin had a .095 batting 

average and two hits. Having been 
named Washington’s Gatorade Player 
of the Year as a senior in high school, 
Franklin wasn’t necessarily used to a 
slump.
Eventually, though, his talent shone 
through. He blasted his first of a team-
high 10 homers on March 20th and 
went on a hitting tear over the next few 
weeks. Franklin finished the season 
with the most RBI on the team and a 
respectable batting average of .327.
A prolific first season at Michigan 
made 
Franklin 
an 
All-Big 
Ten 
Freshman Team Selection.
Freshman of the Year: Ben Dragani
If it wasn’t for freshman left-
hander Ben Dragani’s consistency 
this year, him and Franklin might 
have swapped categories. Another 
extremely talented freshman, Dragani 
was named the Gatorade Player of the 
Year in Wisconsin and a Rawlings-
Perfect Game Honorable Mention All-
American in 2017.
Dragani saw time in the first game 
of the season coming in to relieve senior 
starter Alec Rennard. His solid relief 
performances quickly endeared him to 
the coaching staff and in the last game of 
the Bowling Green series in mid-March, 
Dragani made his first career start. He 
went seven innings without giving up 
an earned run, allowing only five hits 
and striking out six Falcons.
From there Dragani took over 
the Saturday starter position for the 
Wolverines. His team-leading 2.76 ERA 
and consistency on the mound made 
him an All-Big Ten Freshman Team 
Selection joining Franklin in the glory.
Best Individual Performance: 
Jordan Nwogu against Bowling Green 

on March 16th
Freshman 
outfielder 
Jordan 
Nwogu’s performance against Bowling 
Green not only proved he was ready for 
more playing time, but also catalyzed 
the first victory of the Wolverines’ 
20 game win streak. Yet another 
freshman who made waves this season, 
Nwogu first announced himself to the 
Michigan faithful with a multi-hit, two-
RBI effort. His most impressive feat 
of the day, though, was scoring from 
second on a double suicide squeeze 
laid down by freshman shortstop Jack 
Blomgren. The Wolverines made a habit 
of using such a maneuver throughout 
the season, but its first installment saw 
the hulking freshman outfielder beat 
the throw home and put Michigan up 
by two.
There 
may 
have 
been 
better 
statistical performances in the 2018 
season, but none seemed as important. 
In his first career start, Nwogu was the 
main reason the Wolverines secured the 
victory over Bowling Green in the game 
following the Lawrence Tech loss.
High Point: 20 game win streak
From March 16th to April 27th, 
Michigan didn’t lose a game. The streak 
lasted 20 games, and was the program’s 
longest since 1987. The win streak 
featured some thrilling and memorable 
individual moments: the ninth inning 
execution of another double suicide 
squeeze to give the Wolveirnes the 3-1 
win over Michigan State in East Lansing 
and Blomgren’s walkoff sacrifice bunt 
in extra innings against Penn State. A 
number of solid pitching performances 
also factored into Michigan’s success 
during this period.
Overall, though, the streak itself and 
the positivity surrounding the team 
during this time was the high point. The 
Wolverines transitioned from a team 
who had lost to a NAIA team to one 
that was climbing the national rankings 
and capturing the attention of collegiate 
baseball fans everywhere.
Low Point: Losing to Lawrence 
Tech
Sure, Michigan had a disappointing 
end to the regular season and were 
hoping to go farther in the Big Ten 
Tournament than it did— but that 
all paled in comparison to losing to 
Lawrence Tech. The midweek game 
encapsulated all of the team’s struggles 
up to that point and left both the players 
and fans wondering what the hell 
had happened. The Wolverines were 
dominated on their home field by a 
program which was only started in 2012. 
Bakich called it “the most embarrassing 
loss in program history.” The baseball 
program at Michigan started in 1866—
what more needs to be said?
The Future:
The optimism surrounding this 
team prior to the 2018 season was not 
unwarranted, it was maybe just a little 

premature. The 2017 Wolverines had 
just won 42 games and reached the 
NCAA Tournament, and the incoming 
recruiting class was the highest-ranked 
in program history. Yet the veteran 
losses from that 2017 squad and the time 
it took for the freshmen to acclimate 
hindered the 2018 Michigan team.
This program is still trending 
upwards, though. Bakich and the 
coaching staff want to make the 
Wolverines 
perennial 
Big 
Ten 
champions and NCAA Tournament 
participants. They didn’t accomplish 
either of those this year, but with the 
returning players and another talented 
freshman class coming in, there is 
definitely room for optimism.
Michigan loses only five seniors 
this year: pitchers Alec Rennard, Jayce 
Vancena and Austin Batka, and catchers 
Hector Gutierrez and Brock Keener. Of 
this group, only Rennard and Keener 
saw substantial time this season. 
Vancena was set to be a starting pitcher 
this season, but his struggles early on 
saw him pitch sparingly in relief. At both 
catcher and pitcher, the Wolverines 
have the talent to absorb these losses.
Assuming all eligible players return 
next year, the three weekend starters 
should stay the same: sophomore 
Tommy 
Henry, 
Dragani, 
and 
sophomore Karl Kauffmann. Barring 
injury or regression, that threesome is as 
formidable of a rotation as any in the Big 
Ten. The bullpen should also be strong 
as junior Troy Miller will return to 
Ann Arbor as a senior, and the youthful 
contingent of freshmen Jeff Criswell, 
Angelo Smith and sophomore Jack 
Weisenberger will also play prominent 
roles.
Highly-touted freshman catcher 
Joe Donovan saw some time in his 
first collegiate season, but he will enter 
next season as the leading candidate to 
replace Keener behind the plate. Jesse 
Franklin will surely be the starter at first 
base next season and will hit in the four-
spot of the lineup. At second base, junior 
Ako Thomas, one of the team’s best 
all-around players, will hope to bounce 
back from a disappointing individual 
season. Blomgren and either junior 
Blake Nelson or Jimmy Kerr will round 
out the infield.
Nwogu and Lewis will share time 
out in left field most likely, with the other 
claiming the designated hitter role. 
Engelmann and sophomore Christian 
Bullock should both be offensive and 
defensive leaders next year for the 
Wolverines as well.
A 22nd-ranked recruiting doesn’t 
match the previous year’s esteem, 
but should nevertheless add depth. 
If Michigan can learn from this 
year’s shortcomings, they have all the 
ingredients to win the Big Ten and 
secure an NCAA tournament spot next 
season.

After 
heavy 
speculation 
into his rumored departure, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
unequivocally 
announced 
his 
plans 
to 
stay 
with 
the 
Wolverines 
for 
the 
foreseeable future.
Rumors recently surfaced 
of Beilein’s potential move 
further east in the state of 
Michigan to undertake the 
head coaching job for the 
Detroit Pistons. After firing 
coach Stan Van Gundy, the 
Pistons 
are 
in 
desperate 
need of solid leadership and 
are surveying all possible 
options. Somewhere in the 
mix was Beilein’s name.
Putting all worries to bed 

in one tweet, Beilein made his 
intentions known, “I love the 
University of Michigan and 
I am excited about coaching 
our Men’s Basketball Team 
next season and in the years 
to come ! Let’s go hang 
some more banners at ‘THE 
GREATEST 
UNIVERSITY 
IN THE WORLD ‘ #GoBlue.”
Wolverine 
faithful 
were 
left in limbo after Beilein 
interviewed 
with 
the 
Pistons last Thursday, but as 
reported by The Athletic on 
Wednesday, Beilein is now 
close to an extension to his 
current contract with the 
school.
It’s no wonder the 65-year-
old 
coach 
drew 
interest 
from the next level after he 
led Michigan to a program-

record 
33 
wins 
and 
an 
appearance in the national 
title game — his second in 
five years.
Consistently 
summoning 
top-level play from low-level 
recruits, Beilein has amassed 
a 249-143 record in 11 seasons 
with 
the 
Wolverines 
and 
has led Michigan to two Big 
Ten titles and eight NCAA 
Tournament appearances.
Already the ninth-highest 
paid 
coach 
in 
college 
basketball, Beilein’s rumored 
increase 
in 
salary 
could 
bolster his spot in that sense.
“We are thrilled that John 
Beilein will be our coach now 
and into the future.” said 
Michigan athletic director 
Warde Manuel. “We made it 
a priority to sit down shortly 

after our tremendous run 
in the Final Four to discuss 
and solidify his future at 
Michigan. 
Michigan 
has 
become home for John and 
Kathleen the past 11 years 
and we are excited they plan 
to stay for years to come.”
Ask any player or fan of 
the Wolverines, and they will 
share 
Warde’s 
sentiment. 
Having coached eight NBA 
draft picks and tremendously 
raised their pro-ready stock 
with his complex offensive 
schemes, Beilein has two 
elite 
incoming 
freshman 
classes for the 2018-19 and 
2019-20 seasons.
Recently announcing his 
verbal commitment, highly-
touted recruit Jalen Wilson 
is set to play under Beilein 

in Crisler Center for the 
2019-20 season. Coming in 
as the 34th-ranked recruit 
nationally 
according 
to 
247sports.com, 
Wilson 
will be the highest ranked 
recruit for Beilein since Kam 
Chatman in 2014 who was the 
27th-ranked recruit in his 
class.
Coming to Ann Arbor in 
the fall is his second-highest 
ranked class in his tenure at 
Michigan. The class is ranked 
11th nationally and includes 
in-state stars such as forward 
Brandon Johns and guard 
David DeJulius.
Needless to say, Beilein has 
a strong foundation on which 
to expand his legacy with the 
Wolverines in pursuit of the 
ultimate goal: a national title.
