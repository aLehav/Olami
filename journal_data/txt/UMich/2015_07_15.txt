Artists flock to A2 for 56th annual Art Fair

Event organizers and 
officials prepare for four 

unique fairs

Daily Staff Reporter and

Summer Managing News Editor

After a year of intense collaboration 

between local officials and event organizers, 

the 56th annual award-winning Ann Arbor 
Art Fair returns to Tree Town Wednesday.

Occupying 30 Ann Arbor city blocks, 

Art Fair draws roughly 500,000 visitors 
to the city to browse the work of a variety 
of Michigan-based artists. Many visitors 
don’t realize, however, that Art Fair con-
sists of four unique fairs: the “Original” 
Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, extending from 
North University southward to the Diag, 
the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair, located on 
Main Street, the State Street Area Art Fair 
and the South University Art Fair.

According to Maureen Riley, executive 

director of the “Original” Street Art Fair, 
each individual fair reflects the unique 
personality of its location.

“The character of the neighborhoods 

play heavily into the overall feel of each 
fair,” Riley said, adding that the State 
Street fair is known for its sidewalk sales 
while the Summer Art Fair showcases the 
many restaurants and shops that line Main 
Street, in addition to quality artwork. 
Riley said the “Original” fair is organized 
by a non-profit arts organization, which 

explains the fair’s heavy focus on art over 
local businesses.

“Our focus has always been on main-

taining high-quality artistic standards. We 
remain small to accomplish that,” Riley 
said. “We also are committed to engaging 
the public in experiential and educational 
opportunities.”

In addition to showcasing artwork, the 

“Original” fair offers art demonstrations, 
activities and other programs for students.

ARTS

Urban Outfitters 
goes to extreme 
lengths, offering 

crowd-drawing sales 

By DANIELLE 

RAYKHINSHTEYN 

Daily Arts Writer

A headband, a pair of TOMS, a 

skirt, a romper, two dresses, three 
pairs of jeans and two shirts: a list 

of items I bought at Urban Outfit-
ters last year — for approximately 
$120. About $11 an item. This is the 
magic of Art Fair.

If you’ve never been to Urban 

during Art Fair: 1. I would recom-
mend it because you can get half of 
a wardrobe for 100 bucks, and 2. It’s 
quite the production. As an Urban 
Outfitters employee, I help to set 
up tents outside the store just like 
any other vendor — an 80-foot tent 
for women’s clothing and a 40-foot 
tent for men’s clothing, all of which 
is on sale. This in addition to the 

sale section inside the store, and on 
top of all the sale bins of shoes and 
accessories we put out in the front 
of the store.

You can only imagine how 

insanely busy this makes us. With 
all five registers manned at all 
times and at least four mobile regis-
ters outside by the tents for people 
paying with cards, there’s still con-
stantly a line of at least 10 to 20 peo-
ple throughout the day. Our normal 
hours are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Our Art 
Fair hours are 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.

We have our normal fitting 

rooms in the back, and we also set 
up temporary fitting rooms in the 
front of the store. They’re always 
filled; there’s always a line.

And while I can’t give exact 

numbers, suffice it to say Urban 
makes a highly significant number 
in the thousands every day during 
Art Fair … on merchandise that is 
mostly five to 10 dollars. Even as 
an employee, I remain astounded 
by the amount of merchandise sold 
everyday that amounts to such sig-
nificant profits.

Schlissel takes first 
international visit 
as ‘U’ president

Trip to strengthen 
current ties with 
China and foster new 

opportunities

By MAYA SHANKHAR

Daily Staff Reporter

While many in Ann Arbor 

enjoyed the generally pleas-
ant weather of the past few 
days, President Schlissel expe-
rienced a typhoon halfway 
across the world.

Schlissel spent the past week 

in Beijing and Shanghai, meet-
ing with Chinese research 
partners, University alumni, 
students and faculty on his first 
international visit as president 
of the University.

James 
Holloway, 
Univer-

sity vice provost for Global and 
Engaged Education, accompa-
nied President Schlissel on the 
trip.

“China is a nation in which 

UM has deep historical ties,” 
Holloway said.

From 1880 to 1881, James B. 

Angell, president of the Uni-
versity at the time, also served 
as U.S. ambassador to China. 
Angell played an important role 
in encouraging more Chinese 
students to study in the U.S. by 
creating scholarship programs 
specifically for them. Cur-
rently, the University is home 
to over 2,500 students from 
China. According to Holloway, 
China is the most popular des-
tination for University students 
studying abroad, with 400 Uni-
versity faculty, students and 
staff living in China last year.

“We have many successful 

research collaborations with 
the nation’s top universities” 
said Holloway of China. “This 
trip allowed President Schlis-
sel to learn firsthand about the 
University of Michigan’s work 
in China”.

The purpose of the trip was 

twofold, Holloway said: to 
strengthen previously existing 
connections in China through 

direct leadership engagement 
and to develop new opportu-
nities for University students 
and 
faculty 
to 
collaborate 

with China, a world leader in 
research.

“The nation’s large popula-

tion and wide array of academ-
ic and research institutions 
make it an excellent place from 
which to attract academic tal-
ent and establish the mutu-
ally valuable partnerships that 
UM needs to remain a world-
leading research institution,” 
Schlissel said in a press release.

The visit began in Beijing, 

where 
Schlissel 
and 
other 

University leaders met with 
China’s Vice Minister of Edu-
cation, 
Huiqing 
Lin. 
They 

visited the University of Michi-
gan’s Peking University Health 
Science Center Joint Institute 
for Translational and Clini-
cal Research, a collaborative 
research 
center 
established 

in 2010. Twenty-five of the 
29 departments at the Uni-
versity Medical School have 
been involved with the joint 
institute, working on projects 
studying diseases that affect 
both the U.S. and China. The 
president also visited Tsinghua 
University in Beijing, where the 
University has collaborations 
in energy, sustainability and 
the environment. The Universi-
ty is a partner in the U.S.-China 
Clean Energy Research Center, 
a $50 million project that both 
the U.S. Department of Energy 
and the Chinese Ministry of 
Science and Technology are 
involved in.

From Beijing, Schlissel trav-

eled to Shanghai, where the 
University helped create the 
UM-Fudan 
Joint 
Institute 

on Gender Studies, founded 
in 2005. The president then 
toured the Shanghai Jiao Tong 
University Medical School, and 
visited the UM-Shanghai Jiao 
Tong University Joint Insti-
tute, the 2014 recipient of the 
prestigious Andrew Heiskell

Professors analyze Pope’s Latin American tour

Nontraditional topics 

including LGBTQ 
rights among issues 

discussed

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Pope Francis finished his eight-

day tour of the Latin American 
countries of Ecuador, Bolivia and 
Paraguay on Sunday.

Although Latin America 

contains the largest Catho-

lic population in the world — near-
ly half of the world’s believers live 
there — Pope Francis has only vis-
ited once before when he attended 
Brazil’s World Youth Day in July 
of 2013.

Daniel Ramirez, assistant pro-

fessor of History and American 
Culture at the University and an 
expert on Latin American reli-
gious history and culture, said 
the number of Catholics in Latin 
America has been decreasing in 
recent years.

“In general, the Americas repre-

sent the global bulwark for Roman 
Catholicism, and this bulwark 

is showing signs of serious slip-
page,” Ramirez said. “What the 
national figures do not show is the 
most serious trend: the indigenous 
Americas are slipping away at a 
higher rate, mostly to Evangélico 
and other non-Catholic groups.”

Pope Francis came to Latin 

America to address a wide range of 
issues — many of which are seem-
ingly not related to religion.

“As 
peripheral 
countries, 

(Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay) 
represent this pope’s advocacy for 
the economically disenfranchised 
and vulnerable,” Ramirez said.

During his tour, the Pope 

emphasized the corruption of cap-
italism and encouraged grassroots 
organizations to combat economic 
inequalities. He also apologized 
for the horrific acts committed 
on the indigenous peoples in the 
name of Catholicism during colo-
nialism.

Pope Francis is widely regard-

ed as one of the most popular 
popes in recent history and has 
distinguished himself from his 
predecessors with his simplistic 
approach.

“With his prophetic encycli-

cals, pastoral style, administrative 
reforms and downscale lifestyle, 

he has earned a hearing from sec-
tors who previously would have 
disdained an outreach from his 
predecessor(s),” Ramirez said.

Brian Porter-Szücs, professor 

of history at the University and 
expert in Roman Catholicism, dis-
tinguished Pope Francis from his 
predecessor, Pope Benedict.

“Benedict was concerned about 

clarity– having a message that was 
unambiguous and rigorous even if 
that meant the church was small-
er. He was a theologian,” Porter-
Szücs said. “Francis is the pastoral 
pope.

A drug initially designed to 

treat arthritis may now be the 
biggest development in the last 
two decades in treating diabet-
ic kidney disease, according to 
recent University research.

Last week, University Medical 

School researchers and their col-
leagues presented results from a 
randomized, controlled study of 
the experimental drug baricitinib 
in patients with diabetic kidney 
disease.

The results of the study showed 

that, after six months, baricitinib 
substantially reduced a measure 
of kidney dysfunction called uri-
nary albumin/creatinine ratio, 
or UACR. They also showed that 
baricitinib reduced blood and 
urine levels of IP-10 and sTNFR2, 
two compounds that indicate 
inflammation in the kidneys.

Findings also indicted the 

only significant side effect of the 
drug was the onset of mild ane-
mia among the treatment group 
with the highest dose, which was 
predicted based on previous find-
ings.

Frank Brosius, professor of 

internal medicine and a co-leader 
of the multi-institutional clinical 
trial, said his team’s new findings 
are significant because kidney 
disease is a large problem among 
diabetic patients and will only 

worsen in the future.

“Once diabetic patients get 

kidney disease, it leads to a host 
of other problems, so anything 
that we can do to prevent, fore-
stall or treat diabetic kidney 
disease is extremely important,” 
Brosius said.

Nearly 40 percent of diabetic 

patients eventually develop kid-
ney disease. Because diabetes 
incidence rates are currently ris-
ing, especially in countries such 
as China, where half of all adults 
are now pre-diabetic, the results 
of this trial have implications on 
a global health scale, said Brosius.

Matthias Kretzler, professor of 

internal medicine and co-leader 
of the study, said the new find-
ings are a product of decades 
worth of research. 

experiences, the Art Fair oper-

ates as one event. Each fair is set 
to run from Wednesday to Satur-
day. During the week the fair will 
be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and 
on Saturday the fair will close at 6 
p.m.

This year, the Art Fair will 

introduce the Art Go ‘Round, a free 
bus shuttle service that will trans-
port visitors between the four fairs 
throughout the day.

For the enormous event to run 

smoothly, Art Fair requires com-
munication between city officials, 
Art Fair coordinators and Univer-
sity representatives alike.

Jim Kosteva, University direc-

tor of community relations, said 
Art Fair takes a lot of planning on 
the University’s end.

“Primarily, our activities revolve 

around trying to coordinate with 

affairs with the city on the street 
closures to make sure we can still 
conduct as close to business as nor-
mal as we need to and accommo-
date during the art fairs,” Kosteva 
said, citing the University’s need 
to accommodate summer stu-
dents with disabilities who require 
handicap parking, as well as food 
and trash collection services that 
are restricted by the Art Fair.

Kosteva also said this year’s 

Art Fair organizers had to work 
around the University’s construc-
tion along Ingalls Mall off of North 
University.

Along with University represen-

tatives, the City of Ann Arbor is 
also heavily involved in the prepa-
ration process for Art Fair.

“The arts and culture are very 

important to Ann Arbor residents, 
so we provide a welcoming loca-
tion for vendors and visitors alike,” 
Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher

The streets of Ann Arbor are slowly

I took the wrong way to work,

That was a huge mistake.

The Ann Arbor Art Fair actually 

consists of four separate art fairs 
combined for ease of services — the 
Ann Arbor Street Fair, the State Street 
Art Fair, the Ann Arbor Summer Art 
Fair and Ann Arbor’s South University 
Art Fair. The eldest, the Ann Arbor 
Street Fair is celebrating its 56th year. 
The others are 48-, 46- and 16-years-
old, respectively.

Attractions at the Art Fair are highly 

expansive. Demonstrations on North 
University 
include 
printmaking, 

ceramics, photography, drawing and 
wood projects. Artist exhibits, in all 

sorts of mediums, throughout all four 
fairs can be located on the official art 
fair map. The Diag will be host to the 
Art Activity Zone, where at least five 
“kid-friendly” art projects open to all 
of the public from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. The 
Art Fair Main Stage is located on the 
corner of Willard and Church Street 
and will feature artists such as the 
Cadillac Cowboys and Ann Arbor’s 
Keri Lynn Roche.

This year, the Art Fair has four 

featured artists. Chuck Wimmer, 
Katie Hofacker, Dylan Strzynski and 
Ralph Rankin, that will be featured 
by Ann Arbor’s South University Art 
Fair, the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair, 
the Ann Arbor Street Fair and the 
State Street Art Fair, respectively.

The streets are filled with booths, 

tents and stands, selling food, cheap 
crafts and cliché paintings meant for 
lakeside cottages. A variety of fair-goers 
crowd the streets, mingling with artists 
and other pedestrians as they make 
their way through the collections.

I’m finally able to get to the parking 

spot I rent from a student who lives on 
Packard Street. I arrive at work after 
an eight minute speed-walk through 
a field of white tents. Maynard Street 
is covered with artist exhibits and 
stands with cute, but cheaply made 
earrings for sale at $10 a piece. I arrive 
at work and my coworker, running 
around hurriedly behind the counter,

her ponytail in small, ombre wisps. 
Six people wait in line at the register 
as the two employees on shift scurry 
around, trying to finish their tasks 
and help the customers that keep 
piling in.

I grab an apron and jump in.
The day goes by in a blur. Our 

sales are higher than they’ve been all 
summer, and our stock is depleted. 
Twelve people came in asking for a 
glass of water; our store policy is to 
only give water glasses to customers 
who have bought something. I caved

Allowing 
consumers 
to 

choose between established 
energy sources, which are 
extremely costly to the envi-
ronment 
and 
are 
unsus-

tainable, 
and 
renewable 

energies, which aren’t harm-
ful to the environment, but are 
from fledging industries and 
thus pricier, would likely result 
in a decrease in renewable 
energy consumption. The gov-
ernment must mandate renew-
able energy consumption or 
consumers will choose cheaper 
energy sources, regardless of 
the effects on the environment. 
Consumers cannot be expected 
to weigh the long-term effects 
of global climate change and 
the 
benefits 
of 
affordable, 

renewable energy sources in 
the future over their present 
needs to make ends meet; the 
government must step in to act 
on behalf of the best interests 
of its people.

Furthermore, 
the 
energy 

bill introduced by the Senate 
includes potentially devastat-
ing changes to net metering. 
Currently, energy customers 
who produce renewable energy 
through solar panels are cred-
ited for electricity that they add 
to the grid in a process called 
net metering. If the new energy 
bill is made into law, custom-
ers who produce solar energy 
won’t be able to use the energy 
they make from their solar pan-
els. Instead, the power that is 

produced can be sold to energy 
companies at a wholesale rate 
and net metering as we know 
it will be obsolete. Amy Heart, 
from the industry trade associ-
ation Alliance for Solar Choice, 
claims the new bill “dramati-
cally reduces the amount of 
solar that’s going to be sold in 
Michigan because it reduces 
the economic value of it.”

In March, Gov. Rick Snyder 

released an energy message 
that said he’d like to see 30 to 40 
percent of Michigan’s energy 
needs met by a combination of 
renewable and efficient energy 
by 2025. Similarly, Snyder said 
it’s possible for Michigan to get 
19 percent of its energy from 
renewable sources. Yet, like 

All in for the Art Fair

FROM THE DAILY

Dirty energy, bad policy 
 Not updating the renewable energy mandate is a bad decision
M

ichigan Republican lawmakers have introduced a set of bills in 
the Senate that seek to eliminate the mandate for renewable 
energy, which currently requires that 10 percent of energy 

provided by utilities in Michigan be renewable. These bills would allow the 
use of renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines, to be determined 
by the market. Furthermore, these bills prioritize “clean” energy over 
renewable energy, and consider fossil fuel generation technology to be 
“clean,” so long as “at least 85 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions 
captured and permanently sequestered or used for other commercial or 
industrial purposes that do not result in the release of carbon dioxide 
into the atmosphere.” These policies work against renewable energies 
and flagrantly disregard the importance of fighting against global climate 
change and the government’s role in doing so. It’s necessary for the 
government to promote renewable energies through mandates to allow 
them to develop into more cost-efficient and practical technologies. 
Failing to do could allow these technologies to fall into disuse, doing a 
great disservice to the environment and the humans who inhabit it.

the Senate’s new bill, Snyder did not 
include a renewable energy mandate in 
his message. Instead, Snyder is focused 
on reducing energy waste through pro-
grams that help citizens update fur-
naces, water heaters, insulation, etc.

Snyder and the Michigan legisla-

ture, while valiant in their efforts to 
benefit all stakeholders, are misguided 
in their solutions. Without a compensa-
tory reward, it’s unlikely that ordinary 
citizens who are focused on pressing 
issues outside of climate change will 
create the “demand” they’re supposed 

to create. After all, in 2014, a Gal-
lup poll found United States’ concern 
about climate change has dropped, 
with only 24 percent of respondents 
worrying a “great deal.” Michigan 
needs renewable energy because, no 
matter how aware people are, climate 
change is a major issue that needs 
strict, enforced policy in energy-eating 
nations like the United States. Snyder 
and the legislature must create better 
energy policy that benefits consum-
ers and also actively promotes clean, 
renewable energy.

t’s no secret that some-
one presented with both 
a sweater on sale and the 

same sweat-
er 
at 
full 

price 
will 

pounce 
on 

the cheaper 
sweater. No 
one likes to 
pay a lot for something they can 
get for less, especially if it’s not 
against the law. This seems to 
be a major contributor to why so 
many people love streaming ser-
vices such as Spotify, Pandora 
and Netflix.

The recent release of Apple 

Music on June 30 adds to the 
discussion about music stream-
ing services and how streaming 
services add to the deterioration 
of the artist’s position. These 
services have become widely 
used because they’re cheaper 
than buying individual episodes 
or songs on iTunes or DVDs 
from Barnes & Noble. Yet, more 
recently, we’re learning just 
how low the royalties artists 
 

receive are.

If we have annual award 

shows to honor our favorite 
singers and actors, don’t they 
deserve to be paid fairly? Per-
formers spend years of their lives 
making albums and movies, and 
streaming services, such as Spo-
tify, Apple Music and Pandora 
are known for often underpay-
ing their artists, sometimes only 
paying them less than one cent 
per play. They deserve more.

Before the release of Apple 

Music, Apple was set on with-
holding royalties to artists dur-
ing the three-month free trial 
period for customers.

On Pandora, for example, a 

song with one million plays means 
that the songwriter (or writers), 
make only $90. “Wake Me Up!” by 
Avicii, despite the fact that people 
streamed it more than 168 mil-
lion times, only yielded $12,359 in 
domestic royalties from Pandora. 
That money was then divided 
amongst three songwriters and 
Avicii’s publishers. Less popular 
artists (in terms of number of lis-
teners, stand to make much less).

Pandora 
isn’t 
the 
only 

problematic streaming service. 
Spotify pays artists less than one 
cent for each time their song is 
played. To be more precise, they 
pay their artists between $0.006 
and $0.0084 per play.

According to its website, Spoti-

fy says that its purpose is to allow 
people to listen to content legally, 
without having to pay as much as 
they normally would when one 
purchases individual songs. It 
purports that streaming services 
reduce piracy.

As of July 14, its website 

claims there are 20 million paid 
subscribers with over 75 million 
active (free) users on Spotify. 
So there’s no doubt that more 
and more people — who might 
otherwise use pirated copies of 
songs — are using these services. 
Yet, that still doesn’t take away 
from the fact that these sites 
are cheap and free because they 
don’t pay their artists enough. 
In fact, a change in the way that 
these services operate would not 
only benefit artists, but also the 
streaming sites themselves.

There’s always the argument 

that these artists — Taylor Swift 
included — make so much money 
in sales every year that they 
shouldn’t need to worry about 
streaming sites profits. After all, 
Swift made $80 million in 2015.

But that’s just the paradox. She 

is making that 
much money 
because 
she 

has fans who 
are 
willing 

to pay for her 
music, go to 
her concerts, 
read 
maga-

zines that put 
her 
on 
the 

cover and buy 
clothing because she endorsed 
the brand. People idolize her, and 
as a result, companies hire her to 
do ads and cover their magazines 
because she’ll bring in sales and 
draw in readers. If we, as fans and 
consumers, idolize artists for their 
music, movies and TV shows, buy 
magazines where our favorites 
landed the covers, watch them on 
Jimmy Kimmel, put them under 
a microscope in the tabloids, they 
have a certain level of fame and 
deserve the reward that comes 
with it. We shouldn’t expect them 
to be okay with giving us their 
work for almost nothing.

That being said, to provide 

artists with what they deserve 
from 
the 
public 
and 
from 

streaming sites, we must work 
collectively. Every party involved 
can help in various ways. Until 
it’s a collective effort, we cannot 

expect much change. Artists can 
take a page from Swift’s book and 
pull their music off of Spotify, 
which will increase pressure on 
streaming sites to give artists 
what they deserve.

But not every artist has the 

ability to do so, and not every 
artist has the popularity behind 
their movement to make a similar 
impact. Services, such as Spotify 
and Pandora, should rework their 
models so that they’re no longer 
free, but still allow for a free-trial 
period. This would bring in money 
to pay the artists on those sites 
better royalties.

In fact, Premium subscribers 

bring in even higher royalties 
to Spotify artists, so introduc-
ing users as paying subscribers 
is a start to changing the cul-
ture around the entertainment 
industry 
that 
is 
gravitating 

away from adequately compen-
sating its artists. This would 
benefit both these streaming 
services and artists. If these 
streaming services paid their 
artists more, these services’ rev-
enues would also increase from 
 

new subscribers.

Fortu-

nately, there 
has been a 
good 
deal 

of 
research 

done 
that 

shows 
that 

these stream-
ing sites busi-
ness 
models 

are not prof-
itable in the 

long run, so a change would help 
both parties.

Finally, it’s up to the users of 

these services to force them to 
pay artists more, whether it’s 
not using Spotify, or agreeing to 
pay for a premium subscription. 
It’s time something changed. 
Although it would mean pay-
ing a little extra a month for 
a subscription, or paying for 
songs on iTunes, it’s important 
to think about the value of the 
content. Do you go into a cof-
fee shop and expect free coffee? 
When it comes down to it, art-
ists and actors are no different 
from the store owners that you 
buy merchandise from. Artists, 
as anyone else, deserve to be 
 

paid fairly.

How can any 

celebration of art, 

no matter how 

pretentious, really be 

that bad? 


I began working at Urban Outfitters last April as a part-

time sales associate, but I had been to Art Fair the previous 
year, and I think the thing I wondered most was, where on 
earth do all those clothes come from?

In the United States, there are 179 Urban Outfitters stores, 

and, in preparation for Art Fair, we get shipments from near-
ly all of them. Boxes of clothes, shoes and accessories come 
literally by the hundreds — one day, I swear, we got over 200 
boxes — from all over the country.

The process of sorting these boxes by their content is 

extensive and it’s all done in the grungy basement below the 
store and the bustling sidewalk.

Ah, the basement. The basement of Urban is a kind of bit-

tersweet place; it’s nice in the summer when it’s hot and you 
spend your shift in the wonderfully cool basement, listening 
to music and hanging up clothes from all those boxes. It’s 
not so nice when you have to carry over 200 boxes of ship-
ment that are sometimes rather heavy (think: an entire box 
of jeans) down about two flights of concrete steps. Keep in 
mind, the boxes are big, a.k.a. hard to see over. It can be a 

rather frightening experience.

For weeks before Art Fair, we send about five people down 

to the basement every day for five hours to hang all of the 
merchandise.

So, if there are five people in the basement, and at least five 

people upstairs on the floor, and this is still only a part time 
job, I pose my next question: Where on earth do all these 
people come from?

The short answer: lots and lots and lots of interviews.
In preparation for Art Fair, Urban hires 60 to 70 people. 

Yes, 60 to 70. They each get about one or two shifts a week, 
usually in the basement, work about 40 hours during the 
actual Fair as all employees do (it’s definitely an all-hands-
on-deck situation), and then get let go. Considering we were 
still training people the Sunday before the Fair, it can be a 
very seasonal job.

But, it’s worth it for the big fat Art Fair check. Employees 

also get to shop the sale a day early — a huge perk.

There are some exceptions: depending on how many 

employees left Urban over the summer (especially in a col-
lege town, as people graduate or transfer, it’s a pretty high 
turnover rate), about 10 to 20 Art Fair hires get to stay on as 
official hires. But, considering how many are hired, chances 
of that aren’t that great. However, it’s usually pretty obvious 

who wants and is good enough to stay; because we hire so 
many people just for Art Fair, there are a lot of people who 
might not get hired regularly, but we need the humanpower 
for the Fair.

During actual Art Fair, managers from close-by stores 

also come to help out. We acquire more mobile point of sale 
systems. And because everything is so crazy, each employee 
gets a name tag with his or her schedule for the entire Fair 
written on the back, broken down by hour which, for Art 
Fair hires, mostly consists of running down to the basement 
to refill dwindling sale as people purchase items. Everything 
is hyped.

And then, on July 19, everything goes away. Managers 

return to their stores, our basement returns to not doing 
much until next Art Fair and Art Fair hires go on their way.

To be honest, Art Fair is probably my favorite thing about 

working for Urban. While it’s a ton of work for everyone, 
especially for all the managers who have to do even more in 
preparation, it’s by far our busiest and most exciting couple 
of days of the year. I’m kind of sad when it’s over, but it’s also 
fulfilling knowing you helped to pull it off.

As consolation, the new outfits I buy and wear to work 

remain with me, a solemn reminder of those few days of Art 
Fair madness and that mysterious Urban basement.

Ann Arbor sculptor, 

Royce Dubrow 
practices craft

By MATTHEW BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Sometimes it takes a little while 

to act on a fascination. Such is the 
case for local potter and sculptor 
Royce Disbrow who took time out of 
his preparations for the Ann Arbor 
Art Fair to participate in a phone 
interview.

“As a little kid there was a woman 

on TV who used to throw pots on 
some television show and I thought 
it looked like magic,” Disbrow said, 
“Then when my wife and I got mar-
ried there was an adult ed. class on 
pottery and we took it together. I 
was able to throw pots and my wife 
was a fabulous glazer. That’s what 

we did for a little while and my wife 
got pregnant and said, ‘I’m done,’ 
and I continued. That was in the 
’60s.”

Despite his delayed entry into 

the artistic field, Disbrow has been 
creating pottery for more than 40 
years and is a member of the Pot-
ters Guild, a non-profit organization 
operating in Ann Arbor.

“There have been some pretty 

incredible members of The Potters 
Guild and I’ve learned from all of 
them,” Disbrow said. “We go back 
of course to J.T. Abernathy who’s 
been at every art fair in Ann Arbor 
for the last 50-plus years. Bobbi Ste-
vens who was also very active in the 
Potters Guild and was on the board 
of directors of the Street Fair for 
many years. People like that all have 
an influence and yet it’s remarkable 
how our work is all so different from 
each other’s.”

Disbrow 
focused 
mainly 
on 

sculptural work as he outlined his 
artistic process.

“It all starts in your head of 

course. You get an idea for a pot or a 
design or something like that. Then 
you spend a few days to a few weeks 
working on prototypes and testing 
glazes to see what you end up with.” 
Disbrow said. “It takes many left 
turns in that process and so what 
you think you’re going to do when 
you start out usually isn’t what you 
end up with; usually it’s much bet-
ter.”

One left turn happened two years 

ago when Disbrow was working on 
eight-inch Queen Anne style chairs. 
When the pieces were fired, the legs 
began to warp and come up. Dis-
brow embraced the result and called 
the pieces Queen Anne Dancing 
Chairs, writing poems on the bot-
tom of the sculptures to reflect their 
new form.

Along with his ability to adapt 

and change his pieces, Disbrow 
practices his craft with a striking 
mix of storytelling and self-enforced 
efficiency.

“A lot of times as I’m making my 

pots, I make up stories and some-
times history for my own entertain-
ment as I’m working,” Disbrow said.

Along with giving each piece 

a unique tale, Disbrow, a former 
middle 
school 
history 
teacher, 

approaches his craft at times like a 
game, timing himself and empha-
sizing proficiency in creating his art.

“It goes back again to my child-

hood when I read a book called 
‘Cheaper by the Dozen’ and the 
parents were efficiency experts so 
they would time their kids, every-
thing they did, getting ready for 
school or driving someplace. And so 
everything became trying to make 
everything more efficient,” Disbrow 
said. “So as I’m throwing a pot or 
extruding a pot, I time it to see how 

many I can make in an hour or how 
many minutes it takes to make one 
and just try and get more and more 
efficient and sparring in my move-
ments.”

This effectiveness in production 

is more than useful for Disbrow, 
who’s been working nearly everyday 
since January in order to prepare 
for the Art Fair. In that time he has 
created around 400 pieces that will 
be displayed and available for pur-
chase.

Among these sculptures are Dis-

brow’s towers, several of which are 
miniature representation of Ann 
Arbor landmarks. The pieces have 
a standout surreal quality to them 
while maintaining the iconography 
of their larger inspirations, which 
include the University’s Law Quad, 
Engineering 
Arch 
and 
Burton

‘Masters of Sex’ flashes 
forward to new issues

TV REVIEW

Season 3 will shape 

portrayals of feminism 
and sexuality on TV

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

If the pilot and sophomore sea-

sons of “Masters of Sex” haven’t 
aroused modern TV enough, season 
three penetrates 
even 
deeper 

than 
before. 

Eponymously, 
sexual 
tension 

has always been 
abundant; it’s the 
inner, 
personal 

tension 
that’s 

harder to create.

Season Three 

leaps 12 years ahead to 1965 when 
Dr. Bill Masters (Michael Sheen, 
“Frost/Nixon”) and Virginia John-
son (Lizzy Caplan, “Mean Girls”) are 
about to publish their breakthrough 
book, “Human Sexual Response.” 
The episode cuts between the pres-
ent at their press conference and a 
flashback to their lake house vaca-
tion with Libby (Caitlin FitzGerald, 
“It’s Complicated”) four months 
ago. The time jumps are slightly 
disorienting, though, as the show 
already illustrates character devel-
opment brilliantly without the jux-
taposition of past and present.

Bill and Virginia have plateaued 

into familiar — even familial — 
intimacy with each other, but their 
closeness alienates them from their 
families. Virginia cannot stop her 
belovedly 
bespectacled 
Henry 

(Noah Robbins, “Aftermath”) from 
dating a cougar, from getting hit by 
a car, or from enlisting for Vietnam. 
She cannot curb teenage Tessa’s 
(Isabelle Fuhrman, “The Hunger 
Games” series) curiosity for drugs 
or her sexual advances toward Bill. 
The formidable Bill Masters, too 
preoccupied with his own work, 
cannot make himself emotion-
ally available to the children he 
never quite wanted. When Bill’s 
son throws his manuscript into the 
lake in an explosive moment, Bill — 
usually disciplined and calculated 
— has no choice but to accept that 
there are some inevitabilities he 
cannot control. 

The episode delicately captures 

the essence of parenting and uses 
it to examine the duality that exists 
in every individual. Deep down, Bill 
has good intentions, but his evasion 
of fatherly responsibility reflects the 
traumatic neglect he experienced in 
his own childhood. In previous sea-
sons, conflicts with their children 
have stood in the shadows of larger 
adult issues, but the new season may 
pit familial issues against their pro-
fessional lives.

As Bill and Virginia head into 

the public spotlight, they force 
themselves to façade the friction of 
their private lives. They use sex to 
mask deeper emotional problems in 
their relationship. The pristine lake 
house attempts to mask underly-
ing issues in the trio’s lives. Every-
one zips up tightly and plasters on 
a smile, even in moments pregnant 
with discomfort.

The episode especially high-

lights the tragic complexity of 
Libby as a character. Thus far, 
she has doormatted herself, hid-
den beneath her own immaculate 
appearance and her feigned obliv-
ion about her husband’s affair with 
her best friend. She has emotional-
ly prostituted herself in an attempt 
at connection with any willing 
individual. As homoerotic as her 
scene in bed with Virginia is, the 
kiss — her desire to be desired — is 
more tragic than titillating.

However, Libby finally realizes in 

this episode that approval and love 
must come from within. She humbly 
and nobly announces that she will 
end her marriage with Bill. Though 
Bill is also a complex character to 
sympathize with, his separation 

from Libby is a long-awaited breath 
of fresh air. Their divorce is one of 
the first events that strips down 
to the naked truth. Season Three 
insinuates that Libby’s own revolu-
tion is coming.

A disclaimer at the end of the 

episode notes that the children’s 
plotlines are completely fictitious, 
a fact that other reviews condemn. 
However, the beauty of film is that 
fiction adds the dimension of mod-
ern interpretation. “Masters of Sex” 
is not meant to be a documentary or 
textbook. By adding fictional sub-
plots and secondary characters, we 
identify how history is pertinent 
and relatable to society today.

The episode elucidates the “revo-

lution” aspect of Masters and John-
son’s medical research because 
even 50 years later today, human 
sexuality is still taboo. Set amid the 
Vietnam War and the Civil Rights 
movement, the show discusses mul-
tiple instances of female empower-
ment – when Libby independently 
ends her marriage, when Virginia 
insists on finishing her college 
degree – when women finally tear 
down the facades. 

Whereas “virtuosity” was most 

commonly used in terms of sexual 
chastity in the ’60s, “Masters of 
Sex” defines it as personal morality 
— doing good as a mother, as a wife, 
and as a woman for herself.

“We are the sexual revolution,” 

Virginia says.

“You’re pregnant,” Bill adds. 
In a climactic end, what Virginia 

chooses to do with her body in the 
upcoming season will shape the 
portrayal of feminism and sexuality 
on television here forth.

‘Minions’ lives up 
to expectations

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

By CONRAD FOREMAN

Daily Arts Writer

If you watched “Despicable 

Me” and thought I like that movie 
a lot but really 
wish 
there 

more 
scenes 

with just min-
ions 
and 
no 

people 
then 

you’ll love the 
summer’s lat-
est 
animated 

feature, “Min-
ions.”

If 
you’re 

unfamiliar with the minions, 
don’t worry; the narrator (Geof-
frey Rush, “The King’s Speech”) 
offers a thorough backstory. Min-
ions have been around far longer 
than humans, their existence 
dedicated to faithful service of 
the most despicable master they 
can find. And they have had to 
find a lot of masters, since keep-
ing a master has been so hard 
for the minion tribe. After a lit-
any of masters lost, three brave 
minions, Kevin, Stuart and Bob, 
decide to venture into the world 
to find a new master so their 
tribe may survive. When the trio 
comes into service of the world’s 
first female super villain, Scarlet 
Overkill (Sandra Bullock, “The 
Blind Side”), it seems they have 
achieved their goal, though things 
are never quite simple when deal-
ing with a super villain.

The film’s core strength, obvi-

ously, lies in the adorability of 
the minions. To enjoy the film 
it’s essential that you enjoy the 
interactions between and per-
sonalities of the minions. While 
minions don’t speak any one 
human language, their dialect 
includes plenty of phrases and 
words directly from Spanish and 

French (and others). The heroic 
trio is designed to optimize the 
minions’ most endearing fea-
tures: Kevin, the inspired leader; 
Stuart, the wild one; and Bob, 
the eager but simple-minded 
one. Every minion is voiced by 
Director Pierre Coffin, who also 
directed “Despicable Me 2.”

The year of this adventure is 

1968, and the film incorporates 
the era’s culture into its com-
edy. Between the minions walk 
through the set where the moon 
landing was faked, the film’s 
soundtrack laden with hits from 
the British Invasion, and a won-
derful Abbey Road reference, 
the film clearly aims to make the 
experience a relatable one for 
parents and grandparents in the 
audience with their little ones. 
And, of course, the timeframe 
functions to catapult the minions 
into the service of the master we 
already know and love, Gru (Steve 
Carell, “Foxcatcher”).

Sandra Bullock’s Scarlet Over-

kill never convinces us that she 
poses a great threat to the min-
ions, but one shouldn’t expect 
anything but a happy ending 
from this movie (it is a “kids 
movie,” after all). Her punchlines 
are some of the film’s weakest, 
but her partner, Herb Overkill 
(Jon Hamm, TV’s “Mad Men”), 
delivers delightful silliness in 
small doses.

One of the film’s strengths is 

its pace. “Minions” knows itself 
enough keep the runtime right 
at 90 minutes, which means 
the plot unfolds quickly. Any 
film can drag if bogged down 
by extraneous scenes, but that’s 
especially true of a film where 
the main characters speak gib-
berish and jokes are overtly 
silly. The film’s quick pace main-
tained throughout is its success.

Diabetic kidney disease treatment found

University researchers 
develop alternative 

use for arthritis 

drug 

By SANJAY REDDY

Daily Staff Reporter

A drug initially designed to 

treat arthritis may now be the 
biggest development in the last 
two decades in treating diabet-
ic kidney disease, according to 
recent University research.

Last week, University Medi-

cal School researchers and their 
colleagues 
presented 
results 

from a randomized, controlled 
study of the experimental drug 
baricitinib in patients with dia-
betic kidney disease.

The results of the study 

showed 
that, 
after 
six 

months, baricitinib substantial-
ly reduced a measure of kidney 
dysfunction called urinary albu-
min/creatinine ratio, or UACR. 
They also showed that barici-
tinib reduced blood and urine 
levels of IP-10 and sTNFR2, 
two compounds that indicate 
inflammation in the kidneys.

Findings also indicted the 

only significant side effect of 
the drug was the onset of mild 
anemia among the treatment 
group with the highest dose, 
which was predicted based on 
previous findings.

Frank Brosius, professor of 

internal medicine and a co-
leader of the multi-institutional 
clinical trial, said his team’s new 
findings are significant because 
kidney disease is a large prob-
lem among diabetic patients and 
will only worsen in the future.

“Once diabetic patients get 

kidney disease, it leads to a host 
of other problems, so anything 
that we can do to prevent, fore-
stall or treat diabetic kidney dis-
ease is extremely important,” 
Brosius said.

Nearly 40 percent of diabetic 

patients eventually develop kid-
ney disease. Because diabetes 
incidence rates are currently 
rising, especially in countries 
such as China, where half of all 
adults are now pre-diabetic, the 
results of this trial have impli-
cations on a global health scale, 
said Brosius.

Matthias 
Kretzler, 
profes-

sor of internal medicine and 
co-leader of the study, said the 
new findings are a product of 
decades worth of research. 

He explained that, over many 

years, researchers gathered tis-
sue samples from cohorts of 
patients and genetically ana-

lyzed these samples to iden-
tify groups of genes that were 
activated in the progression of 
kidney disease. According to 
Kretzler, these analyses helped 
establish 
the 
connection 
to 

arthritis.

“After 
identifying 
these 

genes, we mapped them into 
networks of interacting genes, 
which led us to identify a sig-
nal transduction cascade called 
JAK-STAT, 
an 
inflammation 

pathway implicated in arthri-
tis,” Kretzler said.

Collaborations amongst the 

University 
Medical 
School’s 

Business Development, the Uni-
versity research team and Eli 
Lilly & Co., the pharmaceutical 
company that first engineered 
the drug to treat arthritis, were 
crucial to the study. 

Kretzler said this collabora-

tion made the strategy of repur-

posing the drug possible.

“This is an example of how 

connecting 
very 
different 

knowledge domains can help 
make what we believe is a sig-
nificant finding for treating 
a disease that has evaded any 
advancement in care for the last 
two decades,” Kretzler said.

Future research aims to iden-

tify different target compounds 
that are involved in the same 
JAK-STAT pathway, or in other 
pathways that have connec-
tions to diabetic kidney disease. 
Once this is done, Brosius said 
researchers can tailor treat-
ments to inhibit or activate the 
pathways.

“We are looking for other 

pathways and targets that aren’t 
even related,” Brosius said. “We 
think that patients have differ-
ent ways of getting to the same 
final point.”

Cindy Ofili stepping out from 
older sister’s Olympic shadow

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Editor

As Cindy Ofili lined up at the 

start line at the British Champi-
onships, she didn’t take her eyes 
off the 100-meter hurdles course.

She didn’t glance at her older 

sister, Michigan alum Tiffany 
Porter, who now runs profession-
ally for Great Britain. And she 
didn’t glance at Michigan coach 
James Henry, who has been at 
the helm of her training through 
her entire Michigan career and 
throughout the summer.

She stared straight ahead and 

ran.

The rising senior sprinter and 

hurdler crossed the finish line to 
place second 12.96 seconds later, 
right behind her sister (12.83).

“Honestly, even though she is 

my sister, she was my competitor,” 
Ofili said. “In between rounds we 
shook hands, but other than that, 
we focused on ourselves. She’s 
one of the best in the world, so I 
know that I’m making progress 
by running with her. It’s a great 
experience and it was very spe-
cial running against each other in 
the finals.”

It’s this discipline and focus 

that affirmed Ofili’s standout 
junior year. She went undefeated 
in the 100-meter hurdles through 
the outdoor season and finished 
runner-up at the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships. With her final 
time of the season, 12.60, she 
broke her personal record by .21 
seconds and the school record 
by .13 seconds 
— a record pre-
viously set by 
Porter 
seven 

years prior.

Her 
time 

also stands as 
the 
seventh-

fastest time in 
the world for 
the 
100-meter 

hurdles.

In the same day as her qualify-

ing 100-meter hurdle race at the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships, 
she broke a second school record 
in the 100-meter dash, finishing 
in 11.39 seconds.

Earlier in the season, she 

defended her title in the indoor 
60-meter hurdles, clocking in 
at 8.15. She was named Big Ten 
Track Athlete of the Week six 

times 
between 
January 
and 

April and received the presti-
gious Michigan Chapter Wilma 
Rudolph Award, among other 
athletic and academic achieve-
ments.

“Every athlete at this stage is 

experienced and skilled,” Ofili 
said. “So you see a lot of similar 
mindsets. I’m definitely excited 

and I feel very 
accomplished. 
I 
did 
things 

I 
didn’t 
even 

imagine 
doing. 

I 
feel 
accom-

plished, 
but 
I 

still 
feel 
very 

hungry 
and 

very motivated 
for this coming 

year.”

She currently holds the school 

record for the indoor 60-meter 
and 200-meter events, as well as 
the outdoor 100-meter dash and 
100-meter hurdles.

A large part of her motivation 

also stems from her coach.

Henry has been the head coach 

for the Michigan women’s track 
and field team for 31 seasons. 
At the 2012 London Olympic 

Games alone, he had three former 
athletes 
competing, 
including 

Porter, as well as one graduate 
student.

“My sister had a similar rela-

tionship with (Henry) as I do 
now,” Ofili said. “He loves us both 
and treats us like we’re great ath-
letes. The thing about (Henry) is 
that he’s always had more con-
fidence in me than I have had in 
myself. He’s always told me I had 
greatness. He knew I had this in 
me all along.”

The four-time Big Ten Cham-

pion is preparing for her senior 
year “hungry” for the upcoming 
competition. Between now and 
the start of the collegiate season, 

she will compete in China at the 
IAAF 
World 
Championships, 

already having clinched her bid 
alongside her sister at the British 
Championships.

She is also enjoying her new 

role on the international stage 
as a soon-to-be professional, and 
states that it’s an “eye-opening 
experience.”

Going into senior year, Ofili 

recognizes that she’ll be facing 
heightened expectations to per-
form and to succeed. She copes 
with the pressure by telling her-
self that her time as a Wolverine 
is a journey, and that with Michi-
gan behind her, she hopes this is 
just the beginning.

“I did things 
I didn’t even 

imagine doing.”


He explained that, over many 

years, researchers gathered tissue 
samples from cohorts of patients 
and genetically analyzed these 
samples to identify groups of genes 
that were activated in the progres-
sion of kidney disease. According 
to Kretzler, these analyses helped 
establish the connection to arthri-
tis.

“After identifying these genes, 

we mapped them into networks of 
interacting genes, which led us to 
identify a signal transduction cas-
cade called JAK-STAT, an inflam-
mation pathway implicated in 
arthritis,” Kretzler said.

Collaborations 
amongst 
the 

University Medical School’s Busi-
ness Development, the University 
research team and Eli Lilly & Co., 
the pharmaceutical company that 
first engineered the drug to treat 
arthritis, were crucial to the study. 
Kretzler said this collaboration 
made the strategy of repurposing 
the drug possible.

“This is an example of how con-

necting very different knowledge 
domains can help make what we 
believe is a significant finding for 
treating a disease that has evaded 
any advancement in care for the 

last two decades,” Kretzler said.

Future research aims to identify 

different target compounds that 
are involved in the same JAK-STAT 
pathway, or in other pathways 
that have connections to diabetic 
kidney disease. Once this is done, 
Brosius said researchers can tailor 
treatments to inhibit or activate the 
pathways.

“We are looking for other path-

ways and targets that aren’t even 
related,” Brosius said. “We think 
that patients have different ways of 
getting to the same final point.”

This approach is going to be 

helpful in Latin America where the 
church has been losing members 
to protestant churches. Francis’ 
approach is very appealing and is 
going to be enormously helpful in 
Latin America.”

Not everyone, however, was 

receptive of the Pope’s anti-capi-
talist messages. Evo Morales, the 
president of Bolivia, said Pope 
Francis was preaching socialism.

In addition to social issues, Pope 

Francis addressed several envi-
ronmental concerns as well: the 
impact of mining on ecosystems 
and the impact farming has on land 
and water resources.

According to Daniel Levine, 

professor emeritus of political sci-
ence at the University as well as a 
professor of political science at the 
Pontificia Universidad Católica of 
Perú, the Pope saw these issues as 
affecting the economic inequal-
ity the indigenous populations are 
experiencing.

“For Francis, the environment is 

a religious issue,” Levine said. “The 
earth is God’s gift and we need to 
respect that gift and think about 
how our use affects all. What he 
is doing is precisely what someone 

in his position can and should do: 
shine light on the issue, legitimize 
it as a matter for public discussion, 
take a position and show its impli-
cations. As for the criticism that 
he should leave science to the sci-
entists, Francis does have a scien-
tific background, more than many 
politicians who cite the science 
only to scorn it.” Before beginning 
his seminary studies, Pope Francis 
worked as a chemical technician.

Ramirez does not see the trip 

as an overall success, however, in 
terms of maintaining the num-
ber of Catholic believers in Latin 
America.

Ramirez said an increasing num-

ber of people raised in the church 
eventually leave it as adults. Citing 
a November 2014 Pew Research 
Institute report on Religion in 
Latin America, Ramirez said that 
of the 94 percent of Paraguay-
ans raised Roman Catholic, only 
a population of 89 percent remain 
as adults. In Ecuador, of the 91 
percent raised in the church, only 
79 percent remain as adults, and 
in Bolivia of the 88 percent raised 
Roman Catholic, only 77 identify as 
Catholic as adults.

“As a researcher and observer 

of ecumenical dialogues, I see 
that this trip is falling very short,” 
Ramirez said. “Perhaps that was 
not on the agenda at all. In any 

case, it would have been an uphill 
slog in a hemisphere where Catho-
lic prelates and elites still have 
trouble relinquishing the levers of 
political and social influence.”

In what was seen as a controver-

sial move for many in the Catholic 
Church, Pope Francis also invited 
gay rights activist leader Simon 
Cazal to his speech on Sunday in 
Asunción, Paraguay.

Ramirez explained the signifi-

cance of this invitation. “I wouldn’t 
expect him to reference the recent 
U.S. Supreme Court decision,” 
Ramirez said. “In fact, things are 
so bad for LGBT folk in Paraguay 
that the simplest gesture of com-
passion and pastoral solidarity 
may suffice for that meeting in that 
country.”

Porter-Szücs saw the Pope’s 

decision to address such issues as 
LGBTQ rights as a step in the right 
direction for Catholics and non-
Catholics alike.

“His 
influence 
among 
non-

Catholics is even more power-
ful,” Porter-Szücs said. “Now he’s 
every non-Catholic’s favorite pope 
because he’s talking about issues 
that transcend denominations.”

Pope Francis will continue his 

oversea travels this fall with a trip 
planned to tour the U.S.

Boo Nieves heads home to 
New York for Prospect Camp

Fifteen Wolverines 
play at NHL camps

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

TARRYTOWN, N.Y. — It’s 

been three years since the New 
York Rangers drafted Cristoval 
“Boo” Nieves in the second 
round (59th overall) of the NHL 
draft. And it’s been two years 
since he first participated in the 
annual Rangers Prospect Camp.

In one year, he will graduate 

from Michigan and, depend-
ing on his performance, pos-
sibly transition from wearing 
maize and blue shirts to being a 
Blueshirt.

But after a standard freshman 

year, a shaky sophomore year and 
a solid junior year, the senior for-
ward might have figured out the 
key to consistency — confidence.

“Between the first time I 

came to camp and the second, I 
would definitely say confidence 
is the biggest difference in me,” 
Nieves said. “Confidence in skat-
ing, faceoffs, everything around 
me. I think confidence is giving 
me a little more of a performance 
boost, and I want to bring that 
back to Michigan.”

His 
execution 
during 
the 

Rangers’ camp at the Madison 
Square Garden Training Center 
in Westchester County, N.Y. cer-
tainly improved from his 2014-
2015 collegiate season and his 
spring six-week workout with 
the Michigan hockey team. And 
his skating earned respect from 

fellow prospects and potential 
future teammates.

Fellow Big Ten hockey player 

and Rangers prospect, forward 
Vinnie Lettieri from the Univer-
sity of Minnesota, said Nieves 
is a “standout leader and (has) 
promising potential.”

Nieves attributes his attention 

to detail — most importantly his 
need to get low, keep his stick 
controlled and become a better 
two-way player — to Michigan 
coach Red Berenson.

“My goal is to make sure 

everyone knows it’s me every 
time I’m out there,” Nieves said. 
“I need to be engaged, be consis-
tent and make something hap-
pen every time I go on the ice.”

He added after the camp: 

“Leaving, I feel way better than I 
did walking in. I had a good start 
but a better finish. I think I did 
pretty well.”

Most notable to the Rang-

ers’ staff, sportswriters and a 
couple of fans in attendance was 
the physical difference between 
2013 and now. With more muscle 
definition and standing a tad 
taller, Nieves was a formidable 
force on the ice.

Nieves was also complimented 

on his skating and passing skills. 
Both were noticeably developed 
in contrast to his first year at the 
camp.

The newly elected alternate 

captain for the 2015-2016 Wol-
verines did admit that his defen-

sive skills could use a little help. 
The forward also acknowledged 
his need to keep the puck on his 
stick longer and attempt more 
shots.

Nieves, 
both 
at 
Rangers’ 

camps and at Michigan, has 
shown an affinity for setting 
up his teammates with passes 
rather than being more assertive 
with his own shots.

His tendency to go for the 

assist rather than the shot has 
led to relatively low scoring 
statistics. He scored just seven 
goals his junior season, three as 
a sophomore and eight his fresh-
man campaign, but had 21 assists 
in both his junior and freshman 
seasons and 19 as a sophomore.

Despite the slightly disap-

pointing statistics, Nieves said 
he plans to carry his “posi-
tive vibes” from training camp 
through to his senior season, 
while looking to increase his 
goal production. Aside from 
team goals, Nieves knows he still 
faces an uphill battle to staying 
in Rangerstown for good.

The Baldwinsville, N.Y. native 

has connected with current and 
former members of the Rangers 
organization in hopes of bridg-
ing the gap between college and 
the pros. A lot of progress needs 
to be made, but one thing will 
stay the same.

“I introduced myself as Boo,” 

Nieves said. “It’s my hockey 
name.”

Fifteen Wolverine team draft 

picks and free agent invitees par-
ticipated in NHL Development 
Camps over the past few weeks, 
honing their skills and gain-
ing valuable experience without 
affecting their NCAA eligibility. 

For the NHL hopefuls, the 

camps provide unmatched expo-
sure to life in the world of pro 
hockey while giving participants 
on-ice training, off-ice workouts 
and the opportunity to meet fel-
low prospects, players and key 
members of the organizations 
they may eventually play for. 

Rising junior forward JT Com-

pher, who was originally drafted 
35th overall by the Buffalo Sabres 
in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, 
officially joined his new team 
for the first time at the Colorado 
Avalanche development camp, as 
his rights were traded to the Ava-
lanche in June. He isn’t letting this 
opportunity go to waste.

“These camps are a great time 

to learn about the professional 
lifestyle and to get familiar with 
the team that may have your NHL 
rights,” Compher told MGoBlue.
com. “Which is important, as 
many guys have the goal to play 
professional hockey. Each camp is 
different but has a focus on skills 
and teaching you useful informa-
tion that you can take back to use 
during the year at Michigan and 
throughout your career. The main 
thing is soaking in this informa-
tion and learning from these dif-
ferent coaches.”

Incoming freshman forward 

Kyle Connor echoed his future 
captain’s sentiments after his first 
skate at the Winnipeg Jets devel-
opment camp, highlighting the 
opportunity to develop and hone 
his skating and other skills after 
the draft. 

The first-round 2015 Entry 

Draft selection — Connor was 
selected 17th overall by the Jets 
— isn’t letting the pressure of his 
top-pick status affect his game, or 
take away from the excitement of 
the whole experience.

“I think it’s more excitement 

(than pressure) for me, definitely,” 
Connor told NHL.com. “I waited 
a long time this year and it was a 

lot of fun this year. And now that 
the draft is over, I think it’s all hard 
work from here.”

Fellow 
first-rounder 
Zach 

Werenski, 
who 
was 
selected 

eighth overall in the 2015 Entry 
Draft by the Columbus Blue Jack-
ets, saw marked improvement over 
his week at development camp. 
The rising sophomore defenseman 
valued the opportunity to focus on 
aspects of his game that often go 
overlooked during the collegiate 
season.

Rising junior forward Alex Kile 

was the only Wolverine to attend 
two different teams’ development 
camps as a free agent invitee. The 
Michigan native spent a week 
training with the Detroit Red 
Wings, his favorite team grow-
ing up. Kile joined former line-
mate Dylan Larkin, who decided 
to forgo his final three years at 
Michigan to sign with the Red 
Wings. 

Kile then immediately went 

to join another former linemate, 
Zach Hyman, at the Toronto 
Maple Leafs Development Camp.

Two future Michigan team-

mates also trained together with 
the Minnesota Wild. Incoming 
freshman defenseman Nicholas 
Boka joined rising junior defense-
man Nolan De Jong with the Wild 
over the past week. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
incoming 

senior class was represented at 
the camps by forwards Boo Nieves 
with the New York Rangers and 
Justin Selman with the St. Louis 
Blues

Goaltender Zach Nagelvoort 

with 
the 
Edmonton 
Oilers, 

defensemen Michael Downing 
with the Florida Panthers and 
Kevin Lohan with the Washington 
Capitals and forward Tyler Motte 
with the Chicago Blackhawks 
rounded out the rising junior class 
for Michigan. 

While Werenski was the only 

rising sophomore to attend a 
camp, the incoming freshman 
class had a strong showing. Future 
Wolverines attending camps in 
addition to Boka and Connor 
included 
forwards 
Brendan 

Warren with the Arizona Coyotes 
and Cooper Marody with the 
Philadelphia Flyers as well as 
defenseman Joseph Cecconi with 
the Dallas Stars.

Alternate captain Boo Nieves left camp confident that he proved why the New York Rangers drafted the forward in the second round in 2012.

Softball stays busy over the 
summer in pros, world cup

Wagner, Romero 
among softball 
players on Team 

USA, NFPL.

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan softball team 

ended its 2015 campaign one 
win 
away 
from 
a 
national 

championship. There isn’t much 
improvement to be made, but with 
impact seniors like pitcher Haylie 
Wagner, catcher Lauren Sweet 
and possibly right-hander Sara 
Driesenga leaving the program, 
multiple 
Wolverines from 
last 
season’s 

successful team 
are playing this 
summer to hone 
their skills.

Rising senior 

infielder Sierra 
Romero 
and 

Wagner highlight the Michigan 
softball players’ summer plans. 
Among the returning players, 
Romero earned a spot on the USA 
National Team, trading in her 
maize and blue uniform to don the 
red, white and blue.

And Wagner, though graduated, 

is continuing her softball career 
with the Pennsylvania Rebellion in 
the National Pro Fastpitch League.

With 
every 
player 
playing 

softball in some capacity while 
school is out, The Daily recaps 
some of the Michigan softball 
players’ summer schedule, past 
and present.

In the 14 games the USA 

National Team has played this 
summer, seven have been against 
international competition. The 
United States have only lost one, 
to Canada, but still bounced back 
to win the World Cup of Softball 
with a 6-1 victory over Japan.

Wolverine 
alum 
Amanda 

Chidester hit a key two-run 
triple in the first inning of the 

championship 
game. 
The 

catcher, 
who 

graduated 
in 

2012, has only 
started in two 
games featuring 
international 
competition, 
but has reached 

base in each appearance. In a July 
1 battle against the United States 
Junior National Team, Chidester 
scorched a two-run homer in the 
second inning. The blast ended up 
being the difference, as the elder 
national team won, 3-2.

Romero played the first three 

games of the tournament, while not 
seeing action in the last four. She 
played well in her starts, knocking 
in six RBI, including three by way 
of a three-run-go-ahead homer 
in the first World Cup of Softball 
contest against Japan.

Romero also faced off twice 

against incoming junior third 
baseman Lindsay Montemarano 
and the New Jersey All-Stars, 
with 
Romero’s 
side 
winning 

both of the matchups, 3-1 and 
8-1, respectively. Montemarano 
batted once in each game and 
struck out both times. Romero 
played in the first matchup, 
batting three times, but recording 
zero hits.

The Stars and Stripes will take 

the field next in the Pan American 
Games starting July 15 in Canada.

As for Wagner, she is enjoying 

her time with the Rebellion, 
but has yet to record her first 
professional win in two starts. 
Her record stands at 0-3, but has 
a 2.14 earned-run average — good 
for 10th best in the league. Wagner 
does have a complete game and a 
save under her belt through five 
starts, so she is getting the hang of 
playing on the professional circuit.

Wagner tweeted Sunday night 

that she is “so content with life 
right now.” Softball fans can 
understand why. She’s living her 
dream, playing the game she loves. 

But as Wagner has learned in her 
rookie season, playing softball 
doesn’t get any 
easier 
after 

college.

“There 
is 

definitely better 
competition 
here,” 
Wagner 

said 
in 
an 

interview with 
the 
Observer-

Reporter. 
“It’s 

a lot harder. This is a higher step 
up.”

Wagner, Romero and the rest 

of the last Michigan squad are 

continuing to play high-caliber 
competition 
even 
during 
the 

offseason. 
And 

in 
Wagner’s 

case, even after 
their 
collegiate 

careers 
are 

over. 
Instead 

of 
summer 

being a time of 
relaxation 
and 

recovery, 
for 

the Wolverines, 

it’s another opportunity to put in 
work.

After all, the quest for a national 

championship never stops.

step up.”
