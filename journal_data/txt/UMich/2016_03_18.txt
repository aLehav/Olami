ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Board also 

addresses concerns 

with new transit 

center

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

During their meeting at the 

University of Michigan’s Dearborn 
campus Thursday, the University 
of Michigan’s Board of Regents 

discussed renovations to Bursley 
Hall Dining Facility, a new transit 
center and the appointment of a 
new interim chief officer at the 
medical school.

Renovation Approvals
The Regents approved a $4.3 

million project to renovate the 
Bursley Dining Hall on North 
Campus this summer. The project 
aims to remodel the dining area 
— which covers approximately 
4,700 square feet — and create 
five separate serving stations with 
different types of foods, much 

like the East Quadrangle and 
South Quadrangle dining halls. 
Funding for the project will be 
provided from University Housing 
resources, and construction is 
scheduled for completion in the 
fall of 2016.

Over 
the 
past 
few 
years, 

significant parts of Central Campus 
housing and dining have seen 
renovations, including West, East, 
North and South Quadrangles, but 
this is the first major renovation 
initiative 
planned 
for 
North 

Campus.

The Regents also approved a 

$46 million project, funded by 
the Hospitals and Health Centers’ 
resources, to build a new University 
health center west of Ann Arbor, 
replacing the current West Ann 
Arbor Health Center facility. The 
new center will be roughly 75,000 
square feet, compared to the 
existing 6,000-square-foot facility. 
It will house a new ambulatory 
diagnostic and treatment center 
as well as a walk in clinic, primary 
and 
specialty 
care, 
infusion,

At end of first 

iteration, opposition 

to program still 

remains

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

On the evening of January 4, 

sharpshooters contracted by the 
city of Ann Arbor from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture were 
scheduled to begin a X-month 
campaign to remove 100 deer 
from the city — a cull — in the face 
of concerns over a outgrowth in 
deer population.

During the day, the city 

streets were largely quiet — the 
New Year had been only three 
days before and two days still 
remained in the University of 
Michigan’s Winter Break.

Nonetheless, by the evening a 

crowd of about 100 had gathered 
outside in front of the Washtenaw 
County Administration Building 

to protest the cull, one in what 
would become a series of ongoing 
demonstrations. At 7 p.m., they 
all piled into the building as 
City Council’s weekly meeting 
commenced.

“What do we want? Stop 

the 
shoot!” 
they 
chanted, 

brandishing signs with similar 
slogans, their shouts resonating 
through the adjacent hallways of 
the building. “When do we want 
it? Now!”

Each speaker at the podium 

during public commentary was 
more emotional than the last, 
with many loudly condemning 
the city for undertaking the 
cull and council members for 
supporting it in a 8-1 vote.

“I see you don’t care much 

about facts, or public safety,” Ann 
Arbor resident Sabra Sanzotta, 
head of protest group Save the 
Deer, said. “Our council has been 
bought and sold — cheaply.”

One 
woman 
kept 
loudly 

interrupting the meeting until 
Mayor Christopher Taylor called

Tenants say they 
weren’t involved in 
talks about changing 

lease duration

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Staff Reporter

Over 
Spring 
Break, 
the 

residents of Munger Graduate 
Residences received a surprising 
e-mail 
from 
University 
of 

Michigan 
administration 

regarding the terms of their 
leases.

The 
e-mail 
detailed 
a 

change in their leasing policy, 
announcing future leases must 
be for a 12-month period. The 
former policy allowed students 
to choose between nine-month 
and 12-month leases, as well as 
to break their contracts upon 
graduation, should they graduate 
during the lease.

Munger, opened in year, is 

University housing specifically 
designated for graduate students 
interested in working with other 
graduate students from different 
areas of study. It was funded 
largely by a $155 million donation 
from Charles Munger.

Rackham 
student 
Marissa 

Quigg, a resident of Munger, said 
these changes were unexpected 
and could make graduation a 
more stressful time than usual.

“This is contrary to what we 

were previously promised as 
recently as February, when we 
were assured that we would all 
have the opportunity to break our 
contracts upon graduation,” she 
said.

Given the late timing of the 

e-mail, many residents who were 
planning to renew their leases for 
a nine-month period next year 
now find themselves in a difficult 
situation, as a 12-month contract 
would require significantly more 
commitment, and little time 
remains for them to search for 
alternative housing.

At the University, students 

can begin to sign leases for off-
campus housing as early as 
Welcome Week. For on-campus 
housing, start dates vary. Both 
often fill quickly.

“There are dozens of students 

who are no longer willing or able 
to renew their lease with Munger 
with a 12-month promise, and 
we find ourselves essentially 
displaced,” Quigg said.

According 
to 
Robert 

Alexander, director and chief 
innovation officer of Munger, 
the policy change is intended 
to foster community within the 
program.

“We form a strong community 

together, and when it is not at 
full strength we are not able to 
deliver on our promise of a truly 
transformational living-learning 
experience,” Alexander wrote in 
the e-mail to the residents. “That 
is why we believe it is important 
for residents to stay for the full 
12-month duration.”

Originally conceived of as a 

large-scale, 
transdisciplinary 

learning community, Munger’s 
self-proclaimed goal has been 
to 
facilitate 
discourse 
and 

partnership between students of 
different backgrounds and career 
paths.

NPR host Diane Rehm discusses her time in radio and her experience with her husband’s death at Rackham Auditorium 
Thursday.

Author discusses 
husband’s battle 
with Parkinson’s 
disease in memoir

By LOGAN HANSEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Diane Rehm, a longtime 

National Public Radio host 
who has hosted “The Diane 
Rehm Show” for more than 
30 years, visited Ann Arbor 
Thursday to promote her new 
book, a memoir published 
earlier this year titled “On My 
Own”.

Along with Cynthia Canty, 

host 
of 
Michigan 
Radio’s 

“Stateside” 
program, 
Rehm 

addressed the topic of “death 
with dignity” in front of a 
sold-out crowd at Rackham 
Auditorium, an issue she’s 

frequently discussed on her 
show.

The 
term 
refers 
to 
a 

set of laws six states have 
made motions to adopt that 
allow 
mentally 
competent 

terminally ill adult patients 
the option to decline further 
treatment, essentially ending 
their own lives. In a on-stage 
conversation 
with 
Canty, 

Rehm largely explored the 
issue through the recent death 
of her husband of 54 years, 
John Rehm, which her memoir 
also discusses in extensive 
detail.

She 
described 
how 
her 

husband, who had lived with 
Parkinson’s disease for nine 
years, told his doctor “he was 
ready to go,” but was told there 
was nothing a doctor could do 
from a legal, moral or ethical 
standpoint.

“John said, ‘I feel betrayed,’ 

” Rehm said. “(He) decided 

on June 14 that he would stop 
taking food, water, medicine. 
I sat by his side for 10 days, 
knowing that his mouth had 
to be dried ... and just watched 
over him carefully.”

Her book, she said, aims 

to be a honest account of her 
husband’s passing, exploring 
how Rehm has had to adapt 
without 
him 
after 
being 

married for most of her life.

She said every person should 

be given the option of whether 
they would like to continue to 
be cared for near the end of 
their life, or if they’d rather go 
out on their own terms, also 
stressing that Americans don’t 
seem to be comfortable talking 
about death.

“The problem here in this 

country is that we are death 
averse,” she said. “We don’t 
like the subject of death and so 
we shy away from it.”

Aerospace prof. 
says he wants to 
more fully define 
impact of college

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

When 
Aerospace 

Engineering 
Prof. 
Alec 

Gallimore joined the faculty 
at the University of Michigan 
in 1992, it wasn’t with plans 
of one day being appointed 
as dean of the College of 
Engineering.

However, two years later 

Gallimore, 
currently 
the 

associate dean for academic 
affairs in the College of 
Engineering, was appointed 
to the position at February’s 
Board of Regents meeting. 
The position is effective July 
1, 2016, through June 30, 2021.

The 
position 
has 
been 

held by current Dean of 
Engineering David Munson 
since 2006.

In 
a 
statement 
on 

Gallimore’s 
appointment, 

University Provost Martha 
Pollack wrote Gallimore is 
uniquely qualified to lead the 
college.

“I am confident that he 

brings the experience, energy, 
and demonstrated leadership 
to guide the world to greater 
visibility as a true exemplar of 
innovation, thus placing (the 
College of Engineering) in the 
highest echelon of institutions 
worldwide,” Pollack wrote.

Groove performs at VictorThon 2016 in the Indoor Track and Field Building on 
Saturday.

Residences challenge students 
to 
develop 
networks 
across 

disciplines and to pursue new 
ideas together, through both 
formal programs and 
casual 

interaction,” its website reads.

In practice, however, this has 

not necessarily been the case, 
says second-year law student 
Marika Rothfeld.

“(My 
roommates 
and 
I) 

requested to be on not the first 
floor, and then we got assigned 
to the first floor. We asked why, 
and (the administration) said 
that they were putting everyone 
with the nine-month lease on 
the first floor, and everyone with 
the nine-month lease happened 
to be law students. And then 
they constantly get angry that 
we’re not very involved with the 
other students, but we’re literally 
segregated on the first floor,” 
Rothfeld said.

Quigg, who is not a law student, 

said in an interview she has had a 
different experience.

“Munger is very unique in that 

it has allowed me to meet tons of 
new students from all different 

disciplines,” Quigg said. “Unlike 
undergrads, graduate students 
primarily, if not exclusively, spend 
time and make friends solely 
within their own department. 
Living in Munger has given me 
the chance to meet students 
that I probably wouldn’t have 
otherwise.”

Spring Break was not the 

first time this year Munger 
unexpectedly changed its leasing 
policy, either. At the beginning 
of (winter) semester, the Munger 
administration announced in an 
e-mail to its residents that only 
residents who had a 12-month 
lease, or would extend their 
current lease to a 12-month lease, 
could reapply for the program as 
current residents, whereas nine-
month leaseholders would have 
to apply through the general 
application.

“As 
previously 
mentioned, 

only those with current 12 
month contracts are eligible for 
reapplication,” the e-mail reads. 
“For those of you who do not 
wish to transfer rooms/extend 
your contract to 12 months but 
wish to live in Munger next year, 
the general application will open 
in early February and all are 
welcome to apply to it.”

However, in a spirited reply-

to-all e-mail, second-year law 
student Dana Ziegler pointed out 
that the residents had not, in fact, 
received any previous warning 
about the policy.

“At 
no 
point 
in 
the 

electronic 
lease 
document, 

or in any advertisements or 
communications 
related 
to 

recruiting residents for Munger, 
did 
Munger 
stipulate 
that 

9-month leaseholders would be 
subjected to additional hurdles 
in order to be considered current 
residents for the purposes of 
reapplication,” Ziegler wrote. “In 
fact, Munger’s Google Plus posts 
encouraging current residents 
to reapply did not distinguish 
between 9- and 12- month leases.”

Though he said he was not able 

to give his own opinion on the 
handling of the policy change, 
Amir Baghdadchi, spokesperson 
and director of communications 
for University Housing, made it 
clear that the administration is 
now taking steps to give residents 
a voice in the process.

“Since this was a change, a 

number of residents asked the 
Munger team to review the new 
policy, and feedback from all 
over the building was collected 
and shared with a task force of 
residents and Fellows working 
on 
flexible 
alternatives 
for 

those residents who took part 
in Munger’s inaugural year,” 
Baghdadchi said in an e-mail to 
the Daily.

The Munger administration 

held 
a 
town 
hall 
meeting 

Wednesday 
night 
to 
discuss 

alternative options for students 
who had lived there the past year 
and were under the impression 
they would be able to live there 
next year without the restriction 
of a 12-month lease.

“After a lot of comments, the 

administration conceded to our 
requests,” Quigg wrote. “As it 
stands, if you lived in Munger 
this year, and plan to live there 
the following year, 9 and 4 month 
leases will be honored.”

The 12-month lease policy 

remains in place for future 
residents of Munger, but the 
administration 
is 
currently 

exploring 
ways 
to 
be 
more 

inclusive of people who would 
leave Ann Arbor for the summer 
or graduate during the school 
year.

Ann Arbor’s 

groundwater is 

center of talk with 
officials, activists

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan’s 

chapter of College Democrats 
held 
a 
discussion 
Thursday 

on 
Michigan’s 
water 
issues, 

focusing on the Flint water crisis, 
a pipeline that carries oil across 
the Great Lakes and the possible 
contamination of Ann Arbor’s 
water supply on Thursday.

LSA sophomore Collin Kelly, 

chair of the College Democrats, 
said the group held the event to 
highlight water issues across the 
state.

“Flint shed a lot of light on water 

issues in general,” he said. “So we 
wanted County Commissioner 
Yousef Rabhi to come in because 
he’s been fighting for six years 
about water issues in Ann Arbor. 
He was able to shed a light on 
things we don’t really see in the 
news, but are really important 
and affecting the people in Ann 
Arbor.”

Flint was a prominent topic 

of 
discussion 
following 
the 

testimony of Michigan Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) earlier in the day 
before the U.S. House Oversight 
Committee, drawing calls from 
several Democratic members of 
the committee for his resignation.

A clip of the hearing was played 

at the College Democrats’ meeting, 
in which Rep. Matt Cartwright 
(D–Pa.) said the governor should 
claim responsibility for creating 
the crisis.

“Plausible 
deniability 
only 

works when it’s plausible,” Rep. 
Matt Cartwright said in the clip. 
“You were not in a medically 
induced coma for a year. I’ve 
had about enough of your false 
contrition 
and 
your 
phony 

apologies.”

Earlier 
in 
the 
day 
the 

University’s College Democrats 
also released a statement calling 
for Snyder’s resignation based on 
his perceived negligence of the 
Flint water crisis.

“It should not take national 

outrage to compel officials to 
address the issues faced by 
our state’s most underserved 
communities,” the statement said. 
“Governor Snyder has prioritized 
fiscal austerity over the health 
and safety of those he is obligated 
to protect.”

During Thursday’s meeting, 

County 
Commissioner 
Yousef 

Rabhi (D) also discussed the 
safety of the Ann Arbor well 
water supply, where a plume 
of 
1,4-dioxane-contaminated 

groundwater is being monitored 
to prevent human consumption. 
Dioxane has been linked to 
cancer and concentration to large 
amounts of it can cause nervous 
system, liver and kidney damage.

Rabhi charged that Michigan’s 

Department of Environmental 
Quality — who allowed Gelman 
Sciences to pump dioxane into the

the room back to order.

The start of the cull — and the 

corresponding outpouring of anger 
that night — was the culmination 
of years of research and advocacy, 
as it became clear that Ann 
Arbor faces both a growing deer 
population and plenty of opinions 
on what to do about it, ultimately 
leading to bitter local politicking 
and accusations of foul play over 
the past few months.

Concerns
There are no reliable figures 

held by the city or county for 
exactly how many deer are in Ann 
Arbor, or how quickly the herd 
has been growing. However, there 
are proxies for it. In 2004, there 
were 31 deer-car collisions in Ann 
Arbor, according to data obtained 
from the Michigan Department 
of Transportation. In 2015, that 
number nearly tripled to 88. In 
the city’s 2015 deer management 
report, an analysis by local activists 
estimated the city’s herd size to be 
between about 1,100 and 1,800.

Ann Arbor’s ecosystem is ideal 

for an expansion in deer population, 
according to Christopher Dick, 
associate professor of ecology at 
the University, who has spoken 
in favor of the cull. He said this 
growth 
would 
ultimately 
be 

destructive to the environment.

“Deer have definitely increased 

in Ann Arbor from what they 
were 10 or 20 years ago,” Dick 
said. “Without any kind of major 
predator, these deer populations 
are going to explode just because of 
their fertility.”

Dick referred to two previous 

studies 
conducted 
at 
the 

University’s George Reserve — of 
which he is director — where a 
herd of six deer in 1928 grew to 162 
by 1933, and a herd of 10 deer in 
1975 grew to 212 by 1980.

“At some point they’re going 

to become overwhelming, there’s 
going to be so many traffic 
accidents, there’s going to be 
so 
much 
ecological 
damage,” 

Dick said, adding that large deer 
populations also increase the risk 
of tick-borne illnesses such as 
Lyme disease.

Some 
residents 
noticed 
a 

problematic increase in deer as 

early as 2006, but attempts by 
individual city council members 
to bring attention to the growth in 
both 2008 and2010 failed to gain 
traction.

By 2013 and early 2014, a more 

visible number of Ann Arbor 
residents began raising concerns 
to both city and county leaders, 
and the overpopulation of deer 
began to be formally addressed by 
Council.

A number of these concerned 

residents 
formed 
the 
local 

association Washtenaw Citizens 
for Ecological Balance by early 
2014. Referred to as “WC4EB”, it 
sought to bring attention to the 
deer issue.

These 
actions 
did 
not 
go 

unnoticed by local animal rights 
groups, who were opposed to the 
possibility of the cull on ethical 
grounds. The Humane Society of 
Huron Valley — headed by Tanya 
Hilgendorf — became one of the 
most prominent of those voices on 
the issue.

“As a community, we embrace 

nonviolent 
conflict 
resolution 

and want to do everything in our 
power to avoid the horrific gun 
violence we have seen elsewhere,” 
Hilgendorf wrote in an e-mail 
interview. “Those same values 
should be applied to our conflicts 
with animals.”

Cull opponents — including 

HSHV — have also questioned 
whether 
deer 
were 
indeed 

overpopulated 
in 
the 
city, 

advocating for non-lethal methods 
of deer control to be explored.

However, advocates like Prof. 

Dick have said over past months 
that they think many of the cull 
opponents’ positions are based on 
scientific misinformation.

“There’s a lot of actual science 

that they refer to, but it’s told 
in 
a 
misleading 
way,” 
Dick 

said, adding that studies have 
shown that non-lethal methods 
of deer management — such as 
immunocontraception 
— 
are 

ineffective.

Road to a cull
On August 17, 2015, City Council 

chose to follow the lethal route 
to control the deer population, 
approving a 1700-page plan put 
forth by city staff that would cull 
100 deer each winter for the next 
four years in city parks. Only 
Mayor Chris Taylor voted against 
the resolution, citing the large 

number of constituents who were 
opposed.

“I 
fully 
empathize 
and 

appreciate the concerns with the 
deer-human interaction,” Taylor 
said in the meeting. “At the same 
time, there are many members 
of the community whose sense 
of place in their city will be 
substantially affected by shooting 
deer within our borders.”

A series of surveys and public 

meetings conducted by the city 
between November 2014 and 
May 2015 suggested a majority of 
residents favored a cull, though cull 
opponents have since contended 
that the surveys were conducted 
in a disingenuous manner to create 
an artificial affirmation for a cull.

Hilgendorf 
wrote 
that 

inadequate 
public 
notice 
was 

given for public meetings on 
deer 
management, 
and 
the 

online survey contained leading 
questions “claiming culling was 
the only effective way of managing 
the problem.”

She noted that even with the 

allegations of bias, 43 percent of 
respondents still voiced opposition.

“So many people knew nothing 

about the issue until after (City 
Council) voted to cull,” Hilgendorf 
wrote, 
adding 
that 
the 
city 

typically advertises such meetings 
with mailed postcards. “No one 
received a postcard inviting them 
to the public meeting on deer 
management.”

Some 
cull 
opponents 
have 

also claimed WC4EB — whose 
advocacy 
efforts 
included 

extensive correspondence with 
city, county and state-level officials 
— were given undue influence 
with the council at the expense of 
groups opposed to the cull.

Hilgendorf 
wrote 
in 
an 

interview that though the city 
interviewed her for an hour in 
October 
2014, 
HSHV 
played 

no role in the decision-making 
process, even though the city 
website listed them as a partner. 
Hilgendorf eventually requested 
HSHV be de-listed as a partner, 
citing that she didn’t feel HSHV’s 
position was being given any 
weight, and therefore the title “had 
no meaning.”

She also charged that WC4EB 

had peddled misinformation on 
the issue, and spoke to Council in 
private

“I wouldn’t say people were 

shut out of the official public 
input process,” Hilgendorf wrote, 
acknowledging HSHV took part 
in public forums. “I would say they 
were shut out of the backroom 
conversations that led to a decision 
to cull — largely before the public 
engagement process even began.”

Sanzotta cited WC4EB email 

exchanges beginning in August 
2014, which she obtained through 
FOIA, to claim pro-cull groups had 
greatly influenced the council’s 
decision long before the rest of the 
public could weigh in.

When presented with these 

accusations, cull supporters — 
including WC4EB member Bernie 
Banet — dismissed the charges as 
ridiculous.

“All 
groups 
were 

communicating with council, as 
we have a constitutional right to 
do. The notion that there were 
some improper connections, or 
we had some magical power other 
than the information we provided 
is kind of laughable,” Banet said. 
“We did this in the public eye, 
and there was ample opportunity 
for the animal rights groups to 
give input. The red-shirted army 
of (cull) opponents was at each 
meeting.”

Banet also said numerous city 

officials have ties to many of the 
animal rights groups opposed to 
the cull that are longer-standing 
and more substantive than their 
ties to WC4EB, also charging 
that cull opponents were the ones 
spreading misinformation.

“What they’ve tried to do to 

document this is to falsify the 
record,” Banet said, saying that he 
and other WC4EB members have 
been intentionally misquoted in a 
pamphlet compiled by Sanzotta, 
and other cull opponents continue 
to spread scientific misinformation.

City 
Councilmember 
Kirk 

Westphal 
(D–Ward 
2) 
also 

dismissed the accusations, saying 
the council listened to all its 
constituents, primarily acted on 
the city staff’s recommendations 
and actually received more e-mail 
traffic from cull opponents.

“It falls on my charge to 

represent the people of my ward, 
and it happens that a couple of 
(WC4EB 
members) 
are 
from 

my ward,” Westphal said. “They 
certainly worked very hard, as did 
the anti-cull people, in gathering 
information, and I think we were 

informed by both sides.”

November 5th
Though the council approved 

the deer management plan in 
August, several roadblocks and 
formalities 
remained 
before 

the cull could begin. Animal 
rights groups rallied from across 
Michigan to oppose the cull, 
including HSHV, the Michigan 
Political Action Committee for 
Animals and the local citizens’ 
group Save the Deer.

MiPACA and Save the Deer 

openly backed councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm’s 
(I-Ward 
2) 

challenger 
in 
the 
November 

election, Sally Petersen, due to 
Lumm’s support for the cull. 
HSHV started a “Stop the Shoot” 
campaign. 
Anti-cull 
websites 

and e-mail newsletters emerged, 
and yard signs with the “Stop the 
Shoot” slogan appeared across the 
city.

The political nature of the 

cull opponents’ new tactics drew 
criticism from some of the public.

In an October 2015 open letter, 

Thomas Weider, local attorney 
and longtime HSHV contributor, 
criticized the organization for 
the lengths it was going to oppose 
a measure that was already 
approved. He also suggested that 
by taking a stance in an election, 
HSHV was violating its tax-
exempt status.

“Council 
voted 
8-1 
(with 

the two absent members also 
supportive) to proceed with the 
cull,” Weider wrote. “The issue 
has been decided, whether HSHV 
likes it or not. Please stop wasting 
my donation dollars.”

On Nov. 3, 2015, Lumm defeated 

Petersen with 64 percent of the 
vote and the highest voter turnout 
among the wards in this year’s 
City Council elections.

Two days later, after a marathon 

public hearing, all of the council 
but Taylor approved resolutions to 
temporarily allow the discharge 
of firearms on public land and 
contract 
USDA 
sharpshooters 

for $35,000 for the cull. A recall 
petition against councilmember 
Westphal in December and a 
January lawsuit — both protesting 
the cull — were swiftly struck 
down.

The cull would proceed as 

planned, despite the objections.

A question of values
By the conclusion of the cull’s 

first 3-month iteration on March 
1, only 63 deer had been killed, 
their meat distributed to local 
homeless 
shelters. 
An 
aerial 

surveyconducted 
in 
the 
final 

week suggested the city’s deer 
population had still grown despite 
the cull.

Leading 
WC4EB 
member 

Maurita Holland said she was 
pleased by the first cull results, 
adding 
that 
the 
successful 

implementation would allay safety 
concerns from other residents. 
WC4EB’s current goals, she said, 
are now public education on the 
issue and the development of a 
comprehensive countywide deer 
management plan.

“We got through this first year, 

nobody died, no pets got hurt, so 
in many ways that was probably a 
success” Holland said.

The 
city’s 
2015 
deer 

management plan described a 
“divergence in values” in the 
city’s population as a significant 
obstacle to overcome. Among 
the local residents interviewed, 
fundamental differences in how 
they viewed humans’ role in nature 
were evident.

Though the ongoing protests 

about the cull have subsided since 
earlier this month, that divide 
clearly remains.

“One of the reasons we came to 

Ann Arbor was to enjoy the park 
systems, the natural habitat, the 
little bit of nature we were missing 
in downtown Detroit,” Sanzotta 
said. “As soon as we got here, 
the next thing we knew was that 
they were going to slaughter two-
thirds of the deer they counted.”

Sanzotta added she intends 

to continue protesting the cull, 
and her group has recently filed 
a new lawsuit against the State of 
Michigan to attempt to halt it.

In contrast, local landscaper 

Christopher Graham noted that 
the original Native Americans 
inhabitants of Ann Arbor would 
hunt deer and maintain ecological 
balance, and said today’s cull is in 
the same spirit.

“If the Indians thought they 

shouldn’t kill deer, the deer 
would’ve eaten them out of house 
and home,” Graham said. “And 
if we don’t control the (deer) 
population one way or another, 
and the most cost-effective way to 
that is killing them, things will get 
out of hand.”

said upon hearing the news, 
he was flushed with feelings of 
nostalgia and appreciation.

“It was a flashback of my 

career at Michigan,” Gallimore 
said. “I started as an assistant 
professor and was thinking wow, 
I didn’t see this one coming 24 
years ago. I felt excitement and 
gratitude for a lot of the people 
who have been very supportive, 
including the current dean, Dean 
Munson, and all of my students, 
faculty members and colleagues 
that I’ve worked with.”

Gallimore’s past experience 

includes 
various 
leadership 

positions. 
He 
was 
formerly 

associate dean for academic 
programs and initiatives in the 
Rackham Graduate School and 
has also served as associate 
dean for research and graduate 
education in the College of 
Engineering. Additionally, he 
has two professorships: He is an 
Arthur F. Thurnau professor and 
the Richard F. and Eleanor Tower 
Professor of Engineering. He also 
has several academic awards, 
including 
acknowledgements 

from the University and the U.S. 
Air Force.

“It’s 
an 
incredible 
honor, 

unbelievable honor actually,” he 
added of the appointment. 

During 
his 
time 
as 

associate 
dean 
of 
academic 

affairs, Gallimore said he has 

experienced the ins and outs of 
the Engineering school.

“My current position until 

July 1 is sort of equivalent to 
a chief operating officer, so in 
some respects I was exposed 
to about all facets of how the 
college works,” Gallimore said. 
“And that’s been extraordinarily 
helpful, not just to faculty fairs, 
space and resources but really 
because Dave (Munson) runs 
a very collaborative team, I 
was able to see a lot of what 
was going on in the other 
areas, like graduate education, 
undergraduate et cetera.”

Gallimore 
founded 
the 

Plasmadynamics and Electric 
Propulsion Laboratory at the 
University, which has become 
one 
of 
the 
world’s 
leading 

and most successful electric 
propulsion research centers, in 
1992. The lab has 50 graduate 
alumni, including 36 doctoral 
degrees and 14 master’s degrees.

Several doctoral and master’s 

degree students work in the lab 
with Gallimore. Among these is 
Sarah Cusson, who is pursuing a 
Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering.

Cusson said Gallimore has 

far more than just the basic 
credentials to be the College of 
Engineering dean.

“He’s very good at what he 

does and he’s very dedicated 
to anything he attempts to do,” 
Cusson said. “He will put as 
much effort, and probably more 
than necessary into anything he 
does.”

One of Gallimore’s defining 

features is his love for the 
University, 
and 
specifically 

engineering, Cusson added.

“He’s very easy to talk to and 

so even though he has so much 
experience and is this big man on 
campus, it doesn’t seem like that 
when you’re talking to him,” she 
said. “You can ask any question 
and I don’t feel like I have to 
impress him when I talk to him, 
I can just ask questions.”

Frans 
Ebersohn, 
Cusson’s 

colleague 
and 
fellow 
Ph.D. 

candidate, echoed her praise for 
Gallimore.

“From 
the 
research 
side, 

he knows what he’s doing and 
he’s done incredible things,” 
Ebersohn said. “As a leader, 
you can ask anybody that has 
worked under him that he is and 
can be the leader you need him 
to be. This is incredible from 
a leadership standpoint that 
somebody’s willing to think of 
the people under him that much, 
and just the fact that he cares 
so much about the people under 
him is something that I think 
makes him an awesome leader 
and perfect for a position like 
this.”

When Gallimore takes over 

the position in July, he has 
many ideas for the College of 
Engineering, he said, but noted 
that he largely hopes to continue 
on the path Munson has laid out.

“There’s a lot of overlap in 

our style,” Gallimore said. “I 
think both Dave and I take the 

work extremely seriously but 
we tend to have a little fun and 
have a little bit more of a relaxed 
style. We’re very approachable; 
both of us are people. I think 
we lead by consensus and are 
very transparent, we try to be as 
transparent as possible.”

His ideas for the future are 

focused on how the College of 
Engineering could become more 
accessible 
to 
undergraduate, 

master’s and doctoral students, 
as well as faculty and facility 
development.

“When I was interviewing for 

the position… the things I focused 
on were faculty recruiting and 
development,” Gallimore said. 
“Planning of the facilities, short 
and long term planning, what 
buildings make the most sense 
to renovate, to add to, to build, 
those types of things.”

Gallimore added that he also 

wants to develop a college-wide 
educational mission, defining 
what exactly it means to graduate 
from the College of Engineering.

“I’m hoping that we’ll actually 

think more critically about our 
educational mission, and think 
about what we should be doing 
at the Bachelor’s, Master’s and 
Ph.D. level more so in the next 
few years,” he said. “We haven’t 
had a major discussion as a 
college to say what does it mean 
to come out with a bachelor in 
engineering? What does it mean 
to have a master’s of engineering? 
What does it mean to have a 
Ph.D. in engineering?”

Transportation 
is 
another 

initiative on Gallimore’s mind. 
One of his longterm goals is 
making the commute between 
central 
campus 
and 
north 

campus easier and re-imaging 
north campus as a destination for 
all students. 

He’s approaching the position, 

he said, with both vehemence 
and apprehension. His first goal: 
Don’t mess up.

“It’s such a great college 

already, and really part of it is 
that there’s a lot of responsibility 
in making sure that we have such 
a world-class university as it is 
of right now, and the College 
of Engineering has to make 
sure that things continue to get 
better,” he said. “There’s a lot of 
competition out there, a lot of 
people looking at Michigan both 
for leadership but also to try and 
knock us off our perch, if you 
will.”

Once the college’s community 

decides which direction it would 
like to pursue over the next five 
years, Gallimore said he plans to 
push for positive change in his 
time as dean.

“It’s a big place, a huge place,” 

Gallimore said. “Almost 10,000 
students, 600 faculty members, 
600 staff, 75,000 alums, so there’s 
a lot to it. It’s a very complicated 
and complex organization. In 
some respects it’s a medium-
sized university. Where do you 
begin in terms of trying to make 
positive and effective change in 
that kind of organization?”

The project is scheduled for

Transit 
center 
public 

comments

During public comments at the 

end of the meeting, the regents 
heard from several community 
members concerned about a 
planned North Campus transit 
facility near several residential 
neighborhoods. 
The 
$38.5 

million project, approved in a 
2014 meeting, is slated to include 
a full-service bus depot and 

maintenance site.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel paused the plans for the 
project earlier this month after 
continuous concern from the 
surrounding residential areas, 
including 
during 
aFebruary 

meeting held about the center by 
the University

During the February meeting, 

Ann Arbor residents expressed 
concern about the proximity of 
the site to residential areas, the 
environmental implications of 
the construction and its impact 
on the community’s character. 
Several also claimed that the 
University 
failed 
to 
engage 

with the residents and lacked 
transparency.

Following 
the 
discussion 

with 
Canty, 
Rehm 
fielded 

questions 
from 
those 
in 

attendance, many of whom 
expressed 
their 
gratitude 

toward her in light of her 
recent announcement that she 
would retire after the 2016 
presidential election.

Like many in attendance 

at Thursday’s event, Russell 
Dykstra, a physician from 
Holland, Mich., was drawn to 
the event because he has been 
a longtime listener of Rehm’s 
show.

After the talk, he said he 

thought Rehm’s discussion of 
death with dignity was unique 
in 
the 
aspects 
of 
patient 

advocacy she discussed: both 
advocacy for people who want 
to choose how they end their 
life, but also advocacy for those 
who may know what they want 
but are unable to articulate it.

Samantha 
Banda, 
a 
lab 

technician in the Ann Arbor 
area, 
expressed 
similar 

sentiments.

“I fully support (Rehm) 

in the movement to create a 
dialogue about dying with 
dignity in America,” Banda 
said. “We are all going to die 
and we might as well be able to 

do it the way we choose.”

Rehm told the audience that 

conversations like Thursday’s 
will be a focus of hers after 
her 
retirement, 
reiterating 

the 
need 
to 
have 
more 

conversations 
nationwide 

about death.

“Too often, what doctors 

are not taught to do is to listen 
to what the patient wants,” 
Rehm said. “Our population is 
aging and we have to confront 
the reality that death is as 
inevitable as birth, and death 
is part of the life cycle. So let us 
talk about this in reasonable, 
easy, absolute, conversational 
ways.”

comply with it, and the state 
legislature still needs to approve 
the standard.

Another major water issue 

in Michigan — Enbridge’s Line 
5, a pipeline that carries oil 
across the Great Lakes — has 
been 
controversial 
because 

environmental 
groups 
are 

concerned about the potential of 
a spill. Another pipeline owned by 
the same company had an oil spill 
in 2010, affecting 35 square miles 
of the Kalamazoo River, the largest 
inland oil spill in U.S. history.

The 
62-year-old 
Enbridge 

Line 5 runs beneath the Straits 
of Mackinac and carries up to 23 
million gallons of light crude oil 
and liquid natural gas every day. 
An oil spill in the Straits would 
be disastrous for the region due 
to the strong currents in the area, 
which would cause it to impact 
the majority of the Great Lakes, 
according to the presentation.

Dave 
Schwab, 
a 
research 

scientist 
for 
the 
University’s 

Graham Sustainability Institute, 
created a simulation showing how 
oil would flow across the Great 
Lakes in the event of a spill.

In the documentary “The Dirty 

Secret at the Bottom of the Great 
Lakes: Oil & Water” made by 
Motherboard, shown during the 
meeting, Schwab said he believes 
the Straits of Mackinac] is the 
worst place for an oil spill in the 
Great Lakes.

“I can’t imagine another place in 

the Great Lakes where it’d be more 
devastating to have an oil spill,” he 
said.

Last 
May, 
various 
groups 

protested outside of the Mackinac 
Island Policy Conference to raise 
awareness for the issue.

LSA sophomore Sari Greife, who 

attended the event, said she found 
the information presented in the 
discussion shocking as an Ann 
Arbor native.

“I thought that it was really 

scary,” she said. “Everything that’s 
happening with the water supply 
in Ann Arbor over the past 30 years 
is really surprising to me because I 
didn’t know much about it and I’m 
from Ann Arbor. My house is in 
that area, so that is kind of freaky.”

W

hen I was eight, I 
nearly 
drowned 
in 

my neighbor’s pool. It 

was one of the 
first weeks of 
the 
summer 

season, 
and 

my friend and 
I were sitting 
cross-legged on 
her sun deck, 
giggling 
in 

our 
matching 

heart-shaped 
sunglasses. 
We 
watched 

her brother as 
he removed the blue tarp that 
covered their in-ground pool. 
We had bothered him to take 
us swimming all morning and, 
reluctantly, he finally gave in. 
After he finished opening the 
pool for us to use, he ran inside 
the house to grab something. 
Without waiting for him to come 
back outside to give us permission 
to swim, as any impatient 8-year-
old would, I slipped feet first into 
the shallow end. Unfortunately, I 
hadn’t realized that the “shallow 
end” was really 6 feet deep.

I was able to keep myself on the 

surface of the water by kicking 
and screaming for what felt like an 
eternity. My throat tightened and 
I gasped for air in short breaths. I 
became exhausted trying to fight 
the water in an attempt to stay 
afloat. In that moment, I forgot 
where I was, what I was doing; I 
only knew fear. Apparently my 
friend’s brother could sense my 
distress through the fear that 
showed in my wide eyes, so he 
jumped into the pool and pulled 
me out.

Afterward, I sat on the side of the 

pool, scared to go back in. I hoped 
to never experience that feeling 
again, and I stayed away from pools 
for a while.

I’ll admit that my drowning 

incident hadn’t really crossed my 
mind as I blossomed into adulthood. 
Honestly, the only kind of drowning 
I had on my mind during my first 
year of college was drowning in debt. 
Fortunately, prior to this point in my 
life, I had learned how to swim. I 
even joined the high school’s varsity 
swim team, even though I wasn’t 
that great. I hadn’t thought about the 
accident again until my freshman 
year of college.

This semester, I was sitting in 

Spanish class and everything was, 
more or less, going smoothly. My 

instructor caught me off guard 
when she called me out to answer 
a question — I had been closely 
studying the hour hand on the 
clock behind her instead of paying 
attention to the discussion. This 
happened often: She always called 
me out when she knew that my 
mind was drifting to another place.

She repeated her question, and 

suddenly, all of the feelings that 
I experienced during my 8-year-
old drowning experience came 
flooding back to me. My chest 
started to tighten and my breath 
began to shorten. I became dizzy, 
nauseous and I felt displaced from 
reality. I couldn’t answer her 
question. For the rest of the class 
I sat in silence.

I went over what could have 

caused the panic attack that I just 
had, and I came to the conclusion 
that my inability to answer her 
question was its driving source. 
Even though having a panic attack 
over something that insignificant 
seemed like an overreaction, I 
couldn’t prevent myself from feeling 
as upset and disconnected as I did. It 
just happened — I had no control; I 
couldn’t stop it.

Afterward, embarrassed, I went 

to office hours to explain to my 
instructor what had happened. I 
felt that I needed to explain to her 
why I didn’t participate for the rest 
of the class. I walked into her office 
resting my palm against the doorway, 
resisting the urge to collapse from 
light-headedness and exhaustion. 
I sat down in the chair that was 
nearest to her desk. I began to sputter 
out an apology.

This normally doesn’t happen, I 

just felt sick. I’m on a new medication 
for anxiety… 

I could tell that what I had 

just said had turned into a pile of 
incomprehensible word vomit by 
the blank expression on her face. 
I could tell that she couldn’t really 
understand what I was saying, so I 
collected myself the best that I could 
and gave my apology another go:

You see, I didn’t participate … 

I couldn’t participate ... because 
I had a panic attack. It normally 
doesn’t happen, but I just switched 
medications, so maybe that’s why … it 
won’t happen again. 

She tilted her head, rested her chin 

on her hand and gave a slight nod of 
approval.

I thought that I was in the clear. A 

moment passed before she spoke.

“Medication…?” She questioned 

accusatively. 
“You 
don’t 
need 

medication; you need a walk 
through the park. Have you ever 
been to the Arb…?”

After half-heartedly contributing 

to the rest of our short conversation, 
I left her office reflecting on what she 
had said:

1) To answer her condescending 

question, yes, of course I had been to 
the Arb.

2) Even if a quick walk through 

the park was all I needed to feel 
like myself again, was she in the 
position to give me advice on how 
to fix my health issue? Was it right 
for her to assume my problem as her 
responsibility to handle, even though 
she didn’t have the appropriate 
medical training to do so?

I came to her in a time of 

vulnerability, not to ask for advice, 
but to seek support and possibly 
kindness 
and 
understanding. 

She swept my concerns aside and 
was extremely patronizing and 
disrespectful.

Angrily, 
I 
shared 
my 
story 

with friends. I learned that other 
people had experienced similar 
problems with their professors. 
One of my friends explained that 
her professor’s lack of respect 
when dealing with her situation 
discouraged her from seeking help. 
This proved to be deleterious to her 
comfort and success in the course.

Teaching staff at the University 

of Michigan should be required 
to partake in more extensive 
sensitivity training. Staff should 
be effectively trained to know how 
to communicate with students 
who suffer from mental health 
disorders. They should be trained 
to recognize common symptoms 
and they should know how to 
intervene appropriately, or they 
shouldn’t be teaching.

It’s hard for a student to learn 

if they feel that they aren’t being 
respected. No one deserves to do 
poorly in a class because their illness 
isn’t taken seriously. Instructors 
should work on their communication 
skills with students and they should 
understand that some students might 
need flexibility with certain course 
requirements. Professionals at the 
University should be educated on 
students with disabilities’ rights 
and services so they can better 
facilitate the success of students with 
disabilities. No student deserves to 
drown because there isn’t someone 
willing to pull them out of the water.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

I 

didn’t spend my spring break in the most 
tropical locale, or one unfamiliar to me: I 
spent my Spring Break in Detroit.

There’s 
a 
sort 
of 

transparent barrier that 
separates 
Detroit 
from 

the suburbs. Even though 
I’ve lived so close to the 
city my whole life (just a 
30-minute drive away), I 
would only go to the city 
if I had an actual reason to 
do so — a concert, a sports 
game, a volunteer event. 
Despite Detroit being a 
mere 45-minute drive away 
from campus, it seems like 
it’s a completely different world: one that, 
for some, seems to be a ghost town rife with 
poverty, crime and hopelessness. Students have 
to make a concerted effort to go to the city, let 
alone engage with its issues. Such a cognitive 
and, in a way, physical distance from the city, 
breeds grave misconceptions about the city. 
These misconceptions make us, as University 
of Michigan students, feel like we need to drop 
in and help them.

My Spring Break trip to Detroit through 

University of Michigan Hillel’s Alternative 
Spring Break program was an immersive, 
service-oriented one. I, along with eight others, 
worked with several different organizations 
that deal with loads of different issues plaguing 
the city, from food justice to land and water 
rights. We worked especially closely with 
children in its broken school system, running 
in-school and after-school programming for 
elementary and middle school students.

At the end of the week, we recognized that 

we did not fix anything. And I believe that 
this realization made our trip much more 
meaningful than it would have been otherwise.

Yes, we did tremendous amounts of work 

over the course of the week. Yes, we learned a 
lot about the issues pressing a city so close but 
yet so far from our campus. But these issues 
run so deeply in Detroit’s history, and are so 
ingrained in its society, that we recognized 
the work we did during that week just barely 
scraped the surface, if it even did at all.

But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do 

service in Detroit. We just need to remember to 
do so mindfully.

At a university as prestigious and competitive 

as our own, service and volunteerism are often 
taken as a resume booster, something that 
can make a student look like an upstanding 
citizen to a future graduate school admissions 

officer or employer. Service turns into a sort 
of obligation as opposed to a genuine effort. It 
becomes a rote, mindless activity, a task to be 
completed in an hour and left at that, rather 
than one meant to challenge beliefs or seek 
what is actually important in the world.

Perhaps the reason this is the case is because 

we’re rarely ever forced to consider the 
implications of the service we do as students. 
There’s an unsaid assumption that sacrificing 
our free time to do community service can only 
do good, when in reality such is not the case. 

There’s often a pretense to service that we 

are helping those who do not have the means to 
help themselves. To think the people of Detroit 
do not have the power to help themselves is a 
grave misconception. The people of Detroit 
started to make tangible change in ways that 
suit their communities well through countless 
different grassroots movements long before 
the city’s “revitalization” was covered by the 
media. And who knows their community better 
than those who live there?

One of the reasons I love Detroit is because 

I learn something new every time I go there. 
It gives me perspective on injustice that I 
could never ascertain from a classroom or a 
discussion on campus, because many students 
or faculty here have never had to deal with the 
types injustices Detroiters face on a daily basis.

During our trip, we constantly talked about 

what it meant for us to come to the city to do 
service for a week, and at some places, for no 
longer than a couple of hours. We listened to 
Detroiters from all walks of life — teachers, 
pastors, students, politicians who deal with the 
city’s issues on a daily basis — speak of their own 
experiences in the city. How are we to make 
any progress without building relationships 
with those directly affected by the issues we so 
much desire to fix?

We need to stop going into places looking for 

opportunities to make them better. We need to 
stop looking at cities like Detroit as places, but 
rather as communities full of people. We need 
to stop acting without listening first.

That means we need to stop looking 

at ourselves as saviors but instead as 
allies — allies who are ready to offer their 
unrelenting support for whatever cause we 
are passionate about. Once we support what 
the people truly want, maybe then we will 
see the injustices subside.

Together, and only together, will we be able 

to fix injustice.

Service and Detroit

I 

never want to get married or have 
children. Yes, I’m 20 years old and I 
know this already. When I smile and say 

I don’t think either are 
for me, I’m disregarded 
by most adults because, 
according to them, my two 
decades on this Earth are 
hardly enough to make 
that 
decision. 
“You’ll 

change your mind one 
day” is something I hear 
quite often. Except, I don’t 
think I will. Actually, I’m 
sure I won’t. I understand 
I’m young, but I think I’m 
able to make informed and 
well-thought-out decisions about my body 
and the types of relationships I want to have.

Just because my body is built to produce 

children, it in no way exsists for just 
that. I want to have 
a bustling career and 
travel 
wherever 
my 

little heart desires and 
children don’t seem to 
fit into that equation. 
The lifestyle I want is 
not kid-friendly. Not to 
mention I know enough 
about myself to say, 
“I don’t want to birth 
a child” and mean it. 
Birth is terrifying to me 
and I applaud my mother for going through 
it twice.

I figure, if one day I decide I want to 

be a mother, there are about 153 million 
orphans around the world who need a mom 
and I would be happy to be that for them. 
But that’s a very heavy “if.” I’m a terribly 
irresponsible person. I can’t keep my room 
clean let alone remember to eat meals every 
day and I don’t see that changing any time 
soon. Keeping myself alive and well on a 
day-to-day basis is a hard enough task. I’m 
not cut out for motherhood.

Nor am I cut out for marriage. I’m not good 

with failure, and let’s be honest, the odds are 

stacked against me. It’s pretty common to hear 
that about half of all marriages end in divorce, 
and though this might not be entirely true, 
I haven’t been exposed to many successful 
marriages in my lifetime. Personally, I don’t 
see the point in having a piece of paper bind 
me to another human being for the rest of 
my life. Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell have 
been together for 32 years, and despite typical 
Hollywood rumors, they do not plan on getting 
married. Having a functional, continuous 
relationship is worth far more to me than 
throwing a party to prove it. If getting married 
is a goal of yours, by all means, go for it. I’m not 
discrediting marriage as a whole, as I know 
there are benefits of having that bond for some 
people. I’m simply saying it is not for me. 

It is time people realize that not all women 

aspire to be moms and wives. If I am self-
aware enough to be making these conscious 
decisions as a young woman, I shouldn’t be 

written off. I’m tired of 
people telling me I’ll change 
my mind one day. I have 
never once heard someone 
tell a woman who says she 
wants to get married and 
have children that she’ll 
change her mind about that. 
When I was growing up, my 
parents 
never 
mentioned 

marriage and children when 
discussing my future with 
me. My education and career 

were their priorities. They saw more in me 
than a future wife or mother.

First and foremost, I am a human being 

who has more purpose in life than starting 
a family. Telling me I’m going to change my 
mind someday is implying that I don’t have 
the agency to understand myself now. It’s 
implying I’m not allowed to have a future 
that doesn’t involve starting a family. Well, 
these decisions are entirely my own and as 
much as you may think I will, I won’t change 
my mind.

Not changing myself

REBECCA 
TARNOPOL

R

obert Reich, former sec-
retary of labor, perfectly 
summarized 
the 
2016 

Democratic pri-
mary 
when 
he 

argued, 
“(Hill-

ary) is the most 
qualified candi-
date for president 
of the political 
system we now 
have. But Bernie 
Sanders 
is 
the 

most 
qualified 

candidate to cre-
ate the political 
system we should 
have.”

Reich’s 
state-

ment, I believe, is reflective of one 
of the most critical divides among 
Democrats this election cycle: the 
necessity to work within the cur-
rent system versus the desire to 
change it entirely.

While it is natural for voters to 

disagree on a primary candidate, 
the rivalry of this particular elec-
tion cycle could prove to be detri-
mental to the future of the party, 
so much so that Clinton cannot 
even rely on supporters of her 
opponent to vote for her in the 
general election if she becomes the 
democratic nominee — and there-
in lies the problem. If Democratic 
voters cannot reconcile their dif-
ferences before the general elec-
tion, they risk being on the wrong 
side of history in the instance that 
the embodiment of radical con-
servatism, prejudice and violence 
assumes the presidency.

The argument within the Dem-

ocratic 
party 
ultimately 
boils 

down to a matter of how much 
one believes this country should, 

and is capable of, systemic change 
— and while the candidates agree 
to some extent on almost every 
major issue, they clash on how 
exactly to reach their respective 
goals, as well as how lofty these 
particular goals should be. Clinton 
seems interested in incremental 
progress, if not the enforcement of 
current progressive policies, while 
Sanders is more inclined to insti-
tute radical change.

On some specific issues, this key 

distinction is a little more obvious 
than on others. For example, Clin-
ton intends to leave Obamacare in 
place, while Sanders favors a sin-
gle-payer system; both candidates 
support raising the minimum 
wage, though Sanders’ $15 an hour 
exceeds Clinton’s $12; and Sand-
ers’ tuition-free plan surpasses 
Clinton’s state grants and debt 
alleviation proposals for higher 
education.

The same fundamental differ-

ences can be found among their 
supporters, with some (particu-
larly those within the establish-
ment) insisting that the only path 
to progress is through patience 
and compromise and others advo-
cating for complete bottom-up 
reconstruction.

That being said, for many Dem-

ocrats, deciding for whom to cast 
their vote is a divergence in ideol-
ogy more so than preference. Hill-
ary supporters write Sanders off 
as being unrealistic, radical and 
naive, while Sanders fans lament 
that the former first lady and sec-
retary of state is disingenuous, 
untrustworthy and too involved 
with the establishment to advocate 
on behalf of the average person. 
Yet as much as the two candidates 

differ in their technique, they see 
eye to eye on most matters of pub-
lic interest, and rejecting one on 
the basis of their strategy is coun-
terproductive to everything the 
party hopes to accomplish in the 
next four years.

This is because regardless of 

who assumes office next January, 
one thing is for certain: The future 
president will have to follow in 
Obama’s footsteps in dealing with 
the largest Republican major-
ity Congress since the early 1930s, 
and in doing so, must successfully 
transform his or her progressive 
rhetoric into tangible, bipartisan 
policy. Though Sanders has been 
labeled as one of the most partisan 
senators on the floor, Republicans 
have shown little interest in work-
ing with Clinton, and it is unclear 
whether or not their attitudes will 
change if the next four years prove 
to be anything like the last eight.

It is clearer now than ever 

before that far more is at stake this 
election cycle than just contention 
between the two major parties. For 
Democrats, the real challenge will 
come in working with one another 
to form a united front against the 
Republican candidate, and if sup-
porters of either candidate can-
not reach some sort of agreement 
before November, their party will 
suffer the consequences. Prag-
matists must make amends with 
idealists, and vice versa, because 
in the end, it is easier to compro-
mise with those who are willing 
to meet you halfway than it is to 
argue with those who are sprint-
ing in the opposite direction.

‘My Land’ reveals an 
educational disparity 

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

French-Israeli 
filmmaker 

Tamara Erde’s debut documen-
tary “This is My Land” offers 
insight into 
the differing 
educational 
systems 
of 

Israel 
and 

Palestine, 
yet fails to 
allow view-
ers to con-
nect with its 
subjects.

In an early 

interview, 
a female Pal-
estinian teacher describes the 
lack of information about Pales-
tinians in Israeli textbooks. She 
opens a textbook and points to a 
small black and white photo in 
the bottom corner of the page. 
Only one child stares directly 
at the camera: a young girl. The 
instructor states that she is the 
only Palestinian in her class. 
After watching this scene, I 
excitedly anticipated intimate 
interviews with other students 
in similar situations. Unfor-
tunately, this is not how Erde 
chose to craft her documentary. 
 

Instead, she structures it as 

an argumentative essay. She 
introduces the film by imme-
diately presenting the audience 
with her thesis — a huge dis-

crepancy exists between the 
actual history of Israel and Pal-
estine and what is taught. The 
body of the film depicts Erde’s 
visits to an Israeli school, an 
Arab school, a Talmudic school, 
a UN school for refugees and a 
mixed school (one that incor-
porates students of Jewish and 
Arab descent). Overall, she 
nicely blends sit-down inter-
views with strictly observa-
tional footage. Maintaining this 
framework to the very end, Erde 
provides a succinct conclusion.

While 
Erde 
commendably 

represents both sides, her style 
makes “This is My Land” feel 
scattered. Once each setting 
is introduced, the film alter-
nates between shots of the 
students and teachers without 
re-establishing which school 
they’re from, causing occasion-
al moments of confusion. Fur-
thermore, while every teacher 
gets his or her own scene, most 
children only get a few sentenc-
es before they’re replaced with 
another. These unsettled tran-
sitions between subjects hinder 
the development of a connec-
tion between the child and the 
audience. 

The footage from the mixed 

school powerfully demonstrates 
how differently the two nations 
teach their respective histories. 
The featured class is co-taught 
by a Palestinian woman and an 
Israeli man. They each pres-

ent their own interpretation of 
the causes of certain historical 
events, allowing the students 
to decide whom they believe. 
Both arguments are ridden with 
faults, which is made appar-
ent in the awkward pauses that 
occur when one teacher cannot 
refute the other’s argument. 

Toward the end of the 90 

minutes, we’re offered a rare 
moment of intimacy. Outside 
the UN school for refugees, two 
young boys and their teach-
er converse on a brick ledge. 
The teacher asks one boy if he 
ever thinks about his parents. 
The boy nods, then proceeds 
to explain how he distinctly 
remembers the moment his 
mother was shot; he violently 
fell from her arms the instant 
the bullet struck and killed her. 

It’s hard not to think of that 

young boy and how government 
officials will try to foster his 
anger toward those who killed 
his mother into violence when 
discussing the film, further 
fueling the tension between the 
nations instead of resolving it. 
His anecdote emphasizes the 
direness of the situation more 
than any other technique or clip 
Erde uses. I wish that the film 
was dominated by testimonies 
so that instead of just being 
made aware of this intense 
manipulation, one could more 
fully understand its destructive 
impact on the children’s lives. 

ALBUM REVIEW
Pete Yorn can’t top 
working with ScarJo

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

Daily Arts Writer

You would think anyone who 

has already created an entire 
album with Scarlett Johansson 
would 
stop 

making 
music 

after 
that, 

because 
noth-

ing would be 
able to top the 
Norah 
Jones-

esque 
qual-

ity 
Johansson 

brings to the 
table. However, 
for 
better 
or 

for worse (the jury is still out on 
that one), Pete Yorn has contin-
ued to make music after Break 
Up, including his newest album, 
ArrangingTime. 

ArrangingTime is a peculiar 

album in the sense that it has 
every quality needed to be amaz-
ing; it’s cohesively put together, 
the individual tracks are well-
composed and Pete Yorn’s croon-
ing vocals do not disappoint. But 
something stops this album from 
becoming a stellar piece, and that 
something seems to be the aura 
of gloominess that surrounds 
ArrangingTime in its entirety. 
From the album cover, tinged a 
shallow blue with Yorn himself 
looking dramatically off into the 
distance, to every song weighing 
itself down with angst, this album 
results in only one question:

Pete Yorn, who hurt you?
ArrangingTime begins with 

“love goes weak when it won’t 
escape / lies and broken faces” 
from “Summer Was A Day,” con-
tinues in the middle with “we 
were born to be discarded” from 
“Shopping Mall” and ends with 
“this fire’s burned out” from “This 
Fire.” These three songs really 
showcase the arc of sadness run-
ning throughout the entire album 
(from 
moderately 
gloomy 
to 

extremely mournful, it concludes 
in a mild level of despair). The 
songs in between fare no better; 
tracks like “Roses” and “Walking 
Up” are equally as soul-crushing 
in their dreariness. These songs 
aren’t abysmal by any means, but 
hearing Pete Yorn’s flat and dole-
ful voice sing about heartbreak 
track after track gets to be cheer-
less and a bit repetitive. 

Even songs with exciting and 

uplifting background rhythms, 
like “In Your Head,” “Scream-
ing At The Setting Sun” and 

“Tomorrow” are shot through 
by the flat line of Pete Yorn’s 
vocals, providing an odd discon-
nect which echoes throughout 
the rest of the album. Arrang-
ingTime is off-putting because 
nothing seems purposeful; the 
songs end up sounding sad, but 
they didn’t seem to be com-
posed with the intention of 
melancholy. The album is aim-
less in the sense that there is 
no substance behind any of the 
songs. From hollow melodies to 
unchanging vocals, Arranging-
Time has no depth or anything 
of importance to say.

The only songs on the album 

that reach any semblance of 
intensity and profundity are 
“Halifax” and “Lost Weekend.” 
The breezy melody showcased in 
“Halifax” complements the easy-
going vocals, creating an airy, yet 
balanced track. “Lost Weekend” 
is ever changing — its melodies 
spark with variation and add 
a third-dimension to the song. 
But even “Halifax” and “Lost 
Weekend” pale in comparison 
with what Pete Yorn could have 
achieved with this album and has 
achieved in past albums. 

But hey, life is a highway (of 

sadness), and Pete Yorn’s just try-
ing to ride it all night long through 
ArrangingTime. Which isn’t a bad 
thing but, just like “Titanic” and 
any book written by Nicholas 
Sparks, it’s only good for shedding 
a few tears … and not much else.

LSA senior joins 
Gaga for Oscars

Fabiana Diaz and 
other survivors 
helped create a 

heartfelt performance 

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

On the Tuesday morning 

before the Oscars, LSA senior 
Fabiana Diaz woke up to an 
email with the subject “Con-
fidential — Academy Awards.” 
She opened it skeptically, posi-
tive it was spam.

Five days later, Diaz was 

standing on the Dolby The-
ater stage at the 88th Academy 
Awards with 50 other survivors 
of sexual assault as Lady Gaga 
sang “Till it Happens to You,” 
the 
Oscar-nominated 
ballad 

from “The Hunting Ground,” 
the song reverberating power-
fully around the theatre to an 
immediate, thundering stand-
ing ovation.

At first Diaz wasn’t sure she 

wanted to be a part of Gaga’s 
performance. As amazing an 
opportunity as it sounded, she 
wasn’t sure she wanted to stand 
up in front of millions of viewers 
and “come out” as a survivor.

But her trepidation evapo-

rated after she talked to her 
parents, her fiancé and her 
friend Andrea Pino — Pino was 
a primary subject of “The Hunt-
ing Ground,” and had nomi-
nated her for this event — all of 
whom convinced her this was an 
opportunity she couldn’t pass 
up.

A few hastily constructed 

excuses to professors later, Diaz 
found herself sitting on a plane 
to Hollywood, getting classified 
email updates from Gaga’s team 
about itineraries.

“We got there Friday and I 

didn’t really think about all my 
emotions, you know, because 
there was just so much adrena-
line,” she said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily, add-
ing that she was thinking about 
the possibility of meeting Leon-
ardo DiCaprio on the airplane. 
“It was a bit of a starstruck 
moment.”

But once the plane touched 

down, meeting the other col-
lege kids who were there to par-
ticipate in Gaga’s performance 
brought her back to reality. The 
conversations naturally turned 
to discussing their experiences; 
“Oh, that happened / happens to 
me too,” was the most common 
thing you’d hear throughout the 
day, Diaz said. Hearing about 
how other schools across the 
nation were dealing with assault 
cases, if at all, was sobering and 
led to immediate and deep emo-
tional connections within the 
group.

“And that’s when I got on a 

rollercoaster ride that I wasn’t 
really prepared for,” Diaz said.

She said Lady Gaga was emo-

tionally “a mess” when she first 
came out on stage to meet the 
college students.

“She was just like, ‘I just want 

to hug all of you.’ She was very 
emotional. She was like, ‘It’s 
been so hard to get out of bed, I 
didn’t want to come to practice 
… but you all being here with 
me is giving me the strength I 
need,’ and I think that showed 
us that we didn’t have to pretend 
we’re fine,” Diaz said. “This 
is when we first realized this 
isn’t easy, and it’s not going to 
be easy. And as exciting as this 
weekend sounds, it’s also very 
triggering.”

The formation of the partici-

pants for the show was three 
lines behind Gaga and her piano; 
they entered after the second 
chorus.

“We were just supposed to 

float in and all walk in together, 
and honestly when the song first 
started to play, this girl next 
to me, we just both started to 
cry,” Diaz said. “Gaga was talk-
ing to us constantly, she would 
not stop talking … it was an all-
around good practice because it 
was just so personal.”

Towards the end of Friday 

night, one of the survivors 

suggested they all get match-
ing tattoos. She brought it up 
to Gaga, who agreed — so they 
did. Stanford University student 
Jackie Lin, one of the survivors, 
designed it, using a symbol for 
unity and Lady Gaga’s favorite 
flower on fire. Gaga got the sym-
bol tattooed on her back later in 
the week, but all of the survivors 
had the tattoos when they were 
on stage Sunday night. The tat-
too itself is “kind of going viral,” 
Diaz said, with hundreds of 
requests daily from survivors 
who want to know if they can 
use the tattoo themselves.

Throughout 
Saturday 
and 

Sunday morning, the news of 
what Lady Gaga’s performance 
was incorporating started to 
leak; eventually people began to 
figure out what the 50 of them 
were there for, even though they 
weren’t allowed to talk about it 
on social media. While people 
were respectful, they often kept 
their distance.

“There was definitely an ele-

ment of ‘oh, the survivors are 
coming through,’ ” Diaz said, 
even sometimes among Gaga’s 
team. It was an attitude that 
they understood, but didn’t 
appreciate.

“My name is Fabiana. I’m 

more than just a survivor; that’s 
not my only identity,” Diaz said. 
“I don’t want this awful thing to 
be the only thing I’m recognized 
for.”

Sunday morning, the group 

had a suite to themselves, com-
plete with what Diaz called “the 
most bougie brunch.” There 
were kale chips, coconut water 
and some sort of non-fat bacon 
chocolate popcorn. Everything 
was non-GMO or vegan. Then 
they went straight into practice, 
after which they had to change 
into 
different 
clothes; 
they 

then had until 5:00 p.m. to do 
whatever they wanted. Gaga’s 
team wanted them in their own 
clothes on stage; they were col-
lege students, and the team 
wanted that to resonate with 
the millions of viewers. Being in 
jeans at the Oscars was weird, 
Diaz said, but before getting 
ready for the show, they all got 
dressed up for the red carpet.

“That’s when it started to hit 

you, like, ‘whoa, we’re at the 
Oscars,’ ” Diaz said.

They had a nice lunch and 

got their pictures taken, includ-
ing some that “The Hunting 
Ground” will be using on social 
media. It was fairly overwhelm-
ing, Diaz said, as there was no 
time to digest. But that part 
of the day was also filled with 
laughter and fun. At one point, 
Diaz saw Ryan Seacrest and 
turned to her friend to try and 
convince her to go with her to 
introduce themselves. But her 
friend was too busy laughing 
hysterically at a pair of puppet 
hot dogs being filmed saying 
“Live from the Oscars.”

Once they were in hold-

ing — meaning they couldn’t 
leave until they were called to 
the stage — Gaga’s choreogra-
phers Richie and Lacey taught 
them the choreography to the 
song “Telephone” to calm their 
nerves. Then they got their hair 
and makeup touched up — all 
of which was minimal — and 
watched the first part of the 
awards ceremony on TV.

Gaga came backstage to talk 

to them before going on, telling 
the group “ ‘I want them to feel 
your pain,’ ” according to Diaz. 
After the performance, Diaz 
saw celebrities crying; while she 
appreciated their sympathy, she 
noted that she didn’t want them 
to forget about the people they 
saw on stage that night.

“For them, it’s a moment.” 

Diaz said. “I’ve cried for four 
years.” 

When the survivors heard 

Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden’s 

speech from backstage, it sud-
denly hit them that this wasn’t 
practice anymore. Then the 
lights turned off. It was so dark 
Diaz couldn’t see the person 
next to her. All 50 of them wait-
ed in silence, listening to each 
other breathing. When Gaga 
started singing, it immediately 
brought her back.

“Freshman 
dorm, 
second 

day,” Diaz said.

The survivors holding hands 

when they walked on stage 
wasn’t planned, Diaz said; nei-
ther was holding their arms 
up at the end of the song. Sev-
eral were crying. They all had 
words or phrases written on 
their arms, like “survivor,” “we 
believe you,” “it happened to 
me,” or “not your fault.” For 
many of them, this was the first 
time they were public about 
their assaults.

As they were going off stage, 

Brie Larson (“Room”) hugged 
all of them, and several Oscar 
attendees thanked them. They 
watched as “Till it Happens to 
You” lost to Sam Smith’s “Writ-
ing’s on the Wall” for Best 
Original Song. While everyone 
was surprised — they had been 
expecting Gaga to win — in the 
end, Diaz said, although it felt 
wrong, it also felt like it didn’t 
matter.

“She didn’t win, but she won, 

you know?” Diaz said. “She won 
the night.”

When Lady Gaga talked to 

them afterwards, she reiter-
ated that sentiment. She spoke 
powerfully and graciously, Diaz 
said, and then posed for pictures 
with all of them.

Even though it sounds like a 

golden weekend in Hollywood, 
Diaz said, “I would give it all 
back.” And she added that’s also 
what she felt upon arriving back 
on the University of Michigan 
campus — that people didn’t 
understand. 
Everyone 
want-

ed to hear about the Oscars; 
she fielded constant questions 
about celebrities, the red carpet, 
awards, etc., but the people ask-
ing the questions didn’t seem to 
realize that expressing friendly 
envy was insulting. Diaz often 
felt like she had to remind peo-
ple of the reasons she was there 
in the first place. Her phone was 
flooded with messages Sunday 
night, even from people to whom 
she hadn’t spoken in years, with 
messages like “I’m so proud of 
you!” and “We should meet up 
over break!”

“I wish I had turned my 

phone off that night,” Diaz said.

The thoughtless comments 

she dealt with prompted her to 
write about her experiences, 
sharing with Facebook friends 
and on other platforms that as 
cool as it was to share a stage 
with Lady Gaga, hug Joe Biden 
or hold Brie Larson’s award, 
none of that mattered nearly as 
much as the real reason she was 
there. Being a survivor of sexual 
assault doesn’t just mean you 
had a singular horrible experi-
ence.

It’s an “exhausting process,” 

Diaz said, and “there’s no guide-
book to living” with it.

Over the past four years, Diaz 

said she has seen a change in 
how sexual violence is talked 
about and handled at the Uni-
versity, but added that there’s 
still a long way to go.

When she arrived on campus 

as a freshman, “Rape wasn’t 
talked about, unless it was a 
rape joke,” she said.

When she went to the admin-

istration about her own assault, 
she said, they handled it poor-
ly. Even though her assailant 
wasn’t found guilty, she said, 
the administration promised he 
wouldn’t be in any of her cours-
es. However, upon walking into 
her first class, she saw the back 
of his head, sitting in the front 
row. Four years later — weeks 
from now— he will be standing 
on the same graduation stage. 

Going to the Oscars, Diaz 

said, was amazing. She got 
her picture taken on the red 
carpet, met interesting and 
quirky celebrities, made life 
long friends, ate bougie food 
and watched in person as Leo 
DiCaprio won his first Academy 
Award. And she’s happy that 
Lady Gaga’s team gave survi-
vors a place to stand tall and be 
acknowledged.

“But,” Diaz said, “even 

though we deserved to be heard, 
and we were ... this is an issue 
we want to continue to bring to 
the stage.”

An intimate release 
from Buckley’s vault

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

You and I, Jeff Buckley’s lat-

est posthumous release, is aptly 
titled — it’s intimate, stark and 
revealing. It is 
Buckley 
and 

his guitar, con-
fronting 
the 

microphone 
and honing in 
on his craft. 
The 
album 

features 
only 

one 
original 

piece, “Calling You,” in which 

Buckley plucks away at his 
guitar and describes a dream. 
“Calling You” aside, the work 
is comprised almost entirely 
of covers recorded as demos. 
These covers ultimately show-
case Buckley’s strengths while 
uncovering some of his few 
weaknesses in tackling styles 
outside of his Grace scope.

You and I takes on big, genre-

defining names like Bob Dylan, 
Sly and the Family Stone, Led 
Zeppelin and The Smiths — 
some more successfully than 
others. 
Starting 
out 
with 

Dylan’s “Just Like a Woman,” 
Buckley seems at home. Danc-
ing across the melodies and 
building up the vocals, the track 
seems to seep out of him with-
out strain or thought.

Unfortunately, the same can-

not be said for his renditions of 
“Everyday People” and “Poor 
Boy Long Way from Home.” 
The groove of Sly and the Fam-
ily Stone is lost with Buckley, 
as the vocals and sporadic gui-
tar seem forced. His voice is at 
times wobbly and unpolished, 
but not without obvious effort. 
His rendition of “Poor Boy Long 
Way from Home” follows much 
in the same style. Buckley sticks 
fairly closely to Bukka White’s 
original instrumentation, but is 
unable to fully capture the blues 
feel that is so essential to con-
veying the track’s emotion.

Though still straying further 

from his Grace roots, Buckley’s 
cover of Led Zeppelin’s “Night 
Flight” is a bigger success than 
the aforementioned tracks. The 
song’s instrumentation is lively 
but has an edge; it prompts you 
to envision Buckley in a dimly-
lit studio engulfed in his own 
musicality. The vocals are on 
the same wavelength as that 

of Robert Plant, but Buckley’s 
higher 
register 
notes 
seem 

strained in comparison to the 
original. Despite the vocal prob-
lems, the track shows Buckley’s 
passion for music. He is an art-
ist, appreciating, enjoying and 
being inspired by another art-
ist’s work in the best way he 
knows — musically.

The highlights of the album 

come in the covers of The 
Smiths’ songs “The Boy With 
the Thorn In His Side” and 
“I Know It’s Over.” The for-
mer manages to capture The 
Smiths’ jangling instrumenta-
tion and the soaring vocals of 
Morrissey 
without 
creating 

a copycat feel. For the most 
part, Buckley sticks closely to 
the original, but he does slow 
down and mellow out the track 
a bit. Adding some length, he 
expands upon the original gui-
tar melody. Repeating phrases 
and rhythms, Buckley gives 
himself room to interact with 
the instrumentation and add in 
vocal improvisations.

The album wraps with the 

latter Smiths cover, “I Know It’s 
Over.” Flowing out of him so nat-
urally, listeners unfamiliar with 
the original track would never 
guess this final song was not 
penned by Buckley himself. The 
finality and delicacy of the track 
is even more poignant when con-
sidering Buckley’s young life and 
untimely fate. Lines like “See, 
the sea wants to take me” and 
“Love is natural and real” are 
both foreboding and character-
istic of Buckley’s work and life.

“I Know It’s Over” itself is 

beautiful, but can also be used to 
make a bigger statement. When 
thinking 
about 
the 
original 

singer, Morrissey, and the iconic 
status and influence that he and 
The Smiths had on the music 
industry, the short life of Buck-
ley seems all the more bitter. It 
prompts listeners to ask, “What 
if?” The finality of the title of 
the track may be an indicator 
that the Buckley’s posthumous 
releases, as there have been 
many before You and I, are com-
ing to an end. If this is the case, 
You and I is the perfect note to 
close on; a note that is telling, 
experimental and sweet. 

FILM REVIEW
‘Crouching Tiger’ 
worse than first

Sequel to the classic 
martial arts movie is a 

total failure

By JOE WAGNER

Daily Arts Writer

The original “Crouching Tiger, 

Hidden Dragon” is considered one 
of 
the 
great-

est martial arts 
movies 
ever 

made — or, at 
least, one of the 
most popular in 
the West. The 
story is entic-
ing and doesn’t 
feel cheesy. Cin-
ematographi-
cally, the film 
inspires 
awe 

as 
the 
cam-

era follows the 
dance 
of 
the 

martial artists. 
“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drag-
on” is packed with beautiful shots 
of incredibly orchestrated mar-
tial arts fights that take place in 
breathtaking landscapes.

If you go into the sequel 

“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drag-
on: Sword of Destiny” expecting 
a movie like the original, though, 
you’ll be seriously disappointed. 
The only thing the two movies 
have in common is the title.

The plot is barely intelligible. 

Warrior Yu Shu Lien (Michelle 

Yeoh, “Tomorrow Never Dies”) 
travels to Peking, where the Green 
Destiny (AKA the titular “Sword 
of Destiny”) is located. While trav-
eling through the forest, a battle 
ensues. Here, we get our first taste 
of the martial arts that “Sword of 
Destiny” has to offer.

At first, the scene brings you 

right back into the world of the 
original “Crouching Tiger, Hidden 
Dragon.” Unfortunately, though, 
the fight choreography in “Sword 
of Destiny” is no longer the semi-
supernatural dance that elevated 
the original movie above the typi-
cal martial arts film. These scenes 
lack the sparkle that made the first 
film so special.

A prophecy is told to Hades 

Dai (Jason Scott Lee, “Back to 
the Future II”), the stereotypical 
mustache-twirling villain of the 
film, that he will rule the martial 
world if he obtains the Green Des-
tiny. Yu Shu Lien brings the sword 
to the House of Te. Hades Dai then 
sends Wei Fang (Harry Shum Jr., 
“Step Up 2: The Streets”) to steal 
the sword from Yu Shu Lien and 
her clan.

Are you following? No? Me nei-

ther.

The story is poorly constructed. 

The object of the title remains rela-
tively unexplained throughout the 
entire movie. There’s no explana-
tion as to why the sword would 
allow Hades Dai to control the 
martial world. There’s no explana-
tion as to why the sword is green. 
The sword doesn’t even look par-

ticularly cool. When the sword is 
used, it doesn’t seem to have any 
special powers. Perhaps this is the 
point of the film, but cinematically, 
it isn’t interesting. When a movie is 
called “Sword of Destiny,” it seems 
like it would be a good idea to make 
the sword something special and 
give a detailed, understandable 
explanation about it.

If upon watching “Sword of 

Destiny” you feel like you’ve seen 
it before, it’s probably because 
almost every scene has appeared in 
a genre movie before, like “Karate 
Kid,” “House of Flying Daggers” 
or “Kill Bill.” For example, when 
Snow Vase (newcomer Natasha 
Liu Bordizzo) trains with her mas-
ter, she is repeatedly asked to do 
unreasonable tasks that only the 
master can do. She gets frustrated. 
This cycle constitutes the majority 
of the training scenes.

Most of the events in the movie 

seem to be constructed for the 
sole purpose of having a martial 
arts scene, which would be OK if 
these scenes were totally spectacu-
lar. The story is seriously lacking. 
Visually, the martial arts scenes 
aren’t as beautiful as they were 
in the original “Crouching Tiger, 
Hidden Dragon.” They often take 
place in lame CGI landscapes that 
have very little to do with the plot 
of the movie.

From the original “Crouching 

Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” we came 
to expect fantastical fights from 
motivated plots. “Sword of Des-
tiny” ultimately fails to live up to

‘M’ takes on Notre Dame

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

BROOKLYN, N.Y. — It has 

been a whirlwind week for 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team, but the 
Wolverines are 
finally 
where 

they want to 
be — playing in 
the first round 
of the NCAA 
Tournament.

It 
may 

have been the 
strangest path 
Michigan 
has 

ever 
taken 

to get there. 
Thanks 
to 
a 

three-day Big Ten Tournament 
run that included victories over 
Northwestern 
and 
conference 

champion Indiana, and then a 
First Four victory over fellow No. 
11 seed Tulsa on Wednesday, the 
Wolverines have earned the right 
to play No. 6 seed Notre Dame at 
the Barclays Center in Brooklyn 
on Friday. It will be their fifth 
game in nine days, spanning three 
different states.

“This has certainly been unique 

being in the First Four and now 
moving forward,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “That was 
something brand new.”

The Wolverines’ unique road 

also made for some unique 
travel circumstances. With the 
game in Dayton tipping off at 
9:10 p.m., Michigan was forced 
to travel to Brooklyn overnight 
after knocking off the Golden 
Hurricane. 
The 
Wolverines 

didn’t arrive in New York until 
4 a.m. and had a wake-up call of 
12:45 p.m. — according to Beilein, 
maybe the latest wake-up time he 
has ever set.

Michigan’s 
legs 
may 
be 

tired, but it certainly won’t be 
catching a break against the 
Fighting 
Irish. 
Notre 
Dame 

doesn’t play particularly fast 

— according to advanced stats 
guru Ken Pomeroy’s website, 
its estimated tempo is 318th 
among 351 Division I teams — 
but the Fighting Irish have five 
starters averaging double-digit 
scoring. They also love to shoot 
from the outside, as four of the 
starters attempted more than 100 
3-pointers this season and the 
team shot 37.6 percent.

The Wolverines have their 

own group of dangerous outside 
shooters — redshirt sophomore 
guard Duncan Robinson, junior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. and 
junior forward Zak Irvin — but it 
may be difficult for them to create 
space and also hold off Notre 
Dame’s offense, especially with 
potential fatigue setting in.

Robinson, 
though, 
isn’t 

concerned about that.

“We’re all 19-, 20-, 21-year-old 

kids,” Robinson said. “I wouldn’t 
necessarily say that (fatigue) is 
always a factor. ... I wouldn’t expect 
it to be a problem tomorrow.”

Michigan did take it especially 

easy 
Thursday 
afternoon 
in 

Brooklyn, 
conducting 
only 
a 

walkthrough session in its hotel 
ballroom and a light 40-minute 
open practice at the arena — 
half of which was devoted to 
stretching and foul shooting.

The Wolverines have little idea 

what to expect from the Fighting 
Irish — despite 
the 
storied 

football rivalry, 
the two teams 
have 
met 
in 

basketball 
just 22 times, 
with Michigan 
leading the all-
time series 15-7. 
The two teams 
haven’t 
met 

since the 2006 NIT, and Beilein 
hasn’t faced off against Notre 
Dame head coach Mike Brey since 
Jan. 9, 2007, when Beilein was 
coaching at West Virginia.

“Mike continues to have great 

players and run great stuff,” 
Beilein said. “Just go back nine 
years ago — they’re gonna throw 
the ball in the post with really 
good post players, they’re gonna 
have 
point 
guards 
that 
are 

excellent and they’ve got enough 

shooters 
all 

over the place. 
... You’ve got 
to be able to 
come ready to 
play, be ready 
to handle a lot 
of really good 
individual 
players 
and 

some 
great 

schemes 
that 

he runs.”

One possible advantage the 

Wolverines might have is that 
they’re already in the NCAA 
Tournament do-or-die mindset — 
unlike Notre Dame, Michigan has 

been fighting for its life for a week 
now and already has a tournament 
win under its belt. In fact, since 
the First Four began in 2011, every 
non-16 seed who won their First 
Four game on Wednesday has 
advanced to the second round.

“There are some advantages to 

it, definitely,” Robinson said. “You 
kinda get that rust off. That’s kinda 
the approach last week we had 
with the Big Ten Tournament — 
we had just played Northwestern 
the night before and went into 
overtime, and Indiana had yet to 
play a game yet.”

The 
Wolverines 
and 
the 

Fighting 
Irish 
have 
another 

late tip-off: 9:40 p.m. on Friday 
night. The winner will advance 
to face the winner of the matchup 
between No. 3 seed West Virginia 
and No. 14 seed Stephen F. Austin, 
which will take place earlier 
Friday evening.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Dakich provides 
lift off the bench

By LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Writer

BROOKLYN, N.Y. — Andrew 

Dakich 
began 
the 
season 

expecting to sit, watch and wait. 
A walk-on junior, Dakich was 
considering spending the year as 
a redshirt.

Dakich is finishing the season 

doing the exact opposite. He 
played 
five 
minutes 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ NCAA Tournament 
victory over Tulsa on Wednesday, 
a statistic nobody would have 
predicted entering the season.

“It’s crazy,” Dakich said. “It’s 

kind of a dream come true. You 
play for Michigan, in the Big 
Ten, and now you’re getting 
postseason action with minutes 
here and there. I don’t really care 
about the redshirt — obviously, 
it’s gone for this year. But (the 
opportunity) 
is 
something 

special, obviously. I’m not looking 
back, and I’m very excited about 
my role on this team.”

The transition from captain 

of the “Bench Mob” to fill-in 
captain of the entire team — 
Dakich sometimes attends pre-
game check-ins with referees 
and opposing team captains — is 
purely a child of circumstance.

It took an early-season injury 

to junior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. to pull Dakich off the bench. As 
Walton sat with an ankle sprain, 
Dakich burned his redshirt on 
Dec. 8 after missing Michigan’s 
first eight games, marking the 
second straight season he has risen 
to the call of duty after beginning 
the year intending to redshirt.

Another pair of injuries kept 

Dakich in the rotation — first, 
senior guard Spike Albrecht’s 
decision to prematurely end his 
season as he recovered from a pair 
of offseason hip surgeries, then 

Caris LeVert’s still-mysterious 
lower-left-leg malady.

Now, Michigan coach John 

Beilein is asking Dakich for 
mistake-free minutes on a regular 
basis. Dakich acknowledges it’s a 
tough assignment for a player who 
relies on his ability to distribute 
and play solid defense in lieu of 
being the scoring spark many of 
his teammates provide, but it’s a 
spot he has come to embrace.

“That’s my role, and I’ve 

accepted that role, obviously, 
because (I’ll do) whatever we can 
do to win,” Dakich said. “At the 
end of the day, my job is to not turn 
the ball over, play the best defense 
I can and set guys up. There is 
pressure, but it’s what you prepare 
your mind for day in and day out.”

Dakich took a step beyond 

his 
role 
last 
week 
against 

Northwestern, draining just his 
third career 3-pointer on an open 
look from the corner. He has 
fulfilled another major part of his 
own listed responsibilities, too, 
turning the ball over just twice in 
his last 34 minutes, dating back to 
Feb. 10 at Minnesota.

Lately, Dakich has seemed more 

assertive, occasionally putting the 
ball on the floor and driving to the 
rim — with varied success — in 
Michigan’s last four games.

Impressively 
open 
about 

his limitations, Dakich simply 
acknowledged the obvious on 
Wednesday: Walton can’t play 
40 minutes per game, and with 
injured senior guard Albrecht 
out of the picture, it’s up to him 
to bridge the gap in whatever 
way possible.

“I love what Andrew’s been 

able to do,” Beilein said, echoing 
Dakich’s own phrasing. “It’s a 
dream come true for him, and 
he’ll be in there again tomorrow 
(against 6-seed Notre Dame).”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’, Irish players 
revisit rivalries

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

BROOKLYN, N.Y. — Growing 

up, 
most 
members 
of 
the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
were aware of the deep history 
between Michigan and Notre 
Dame — on the gridiron, that is.

It’s hard to be a fan of college 

football 
without 
knowing 

about the tradition between the 
two schools, even if you play 
basketball instead of football. 
Though there isn’t a basketball 
rivalry, some sort of rivalry will 
exist on Friday for those who hail 
from the Hoosier State.

“Our young men, (the Fighting 

Irish) have a lot of Midwest 
kids,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “We have a lot of Midwest 
kids. They’ve all played against 
each other. I think those rivalries 
probably were formed way before 
anybody thought it would be a 
Notre Dame-Michigan game. It 
might have been eighth grade 
they played against each other. 
So it’s a great basketball game. 
I know that there will be a lot of 
people tuned in.”

Juniors Zak Irvin, Andrew 

Dakich 
and 
Sean 
Lonergan 

will see many familiar faces on 
the court Friday, including V.J. 
Beachem, Demetrius Jackson, 
Austin Torres and Austin Burgett. 

“Growing up in Indiana, you 

hear about IU basketball, Butler, 
Purdue and Notre Dame,” Dakich 
said. “So to actually get a chance 
to play them — because we don’t 
play them in the regular season — 
to get the chance to play them in 
the first round, I mean, everyone’s 
looking forward to it.”

Lonergan is looking forward 

to seeing the improvement in 
each player since the last time 
he played against them, noting 
that Beachem’s game has grown 
considerably in the past few years. 

Dakich, on the other hand, 

mentioned 
that 
he 
enjoyed 

watching the football matchup 
between 
Notre 
Dame 
and 

Michigan during his freshman 

and sophomore seasons. Though 
the rivalry game was discontinued 
indefinitely starting his junior 
year of college, he thinks it will 
be interesting to meet with the 
Fighting Irish on the hardwood 
for the first time since 2006. 

“To play them in the first 

round, we know it’s going to be 
a challenge,” Dakich said. “It 
should be a great game, and I 
think we have a lot of (alumni) 
in this area and they do too, so it 
should be fun.”

Senior guard Spike Albrecht, 

who’s also from Indiana, didn’t get 
the chance to play with the same 
athletes throughout high school 
because of his older age. But he 
remembers Auguste well from 
prep school in Massachusetts.

“He’s a really good player,” 

Albrecht said. “He gave us the 
business out of prep school. 
He’s real good. He’s obviously 
had a great college career and a 
really good senior season. He’s 
going to be a tough matchup for 
us, but they’re just a really good 
overall team.”

Though 
Lonergan, 
Dakich 

and Albrecht saw the future 
Fighting Irish occasionally, it 
wasn’t anywhere near as often 
as Irvin did. He grew up playing 
AAU and high school basketball 
with Beachem, and played on the 
same all-star team with Jackson 
in their senior year.

Irvin doesn’t see Beachem 

and Jackson — both of whom are 
starters — as often anymore, but 
talks with them every now and 
then over the summers when 
there’s more free time. 

Despite going their separate 

ways, Irvin doesn’t feel any ill will 
against either of them.

“Especially when you’re old 

teammates with someone, you 
always want to see them do well,” 
Irvin said. “Notre Dame has done 
really well, especially in the Elite 
Eight last year.

“I know it’s going to be a tough 

game for us, and I wish them 
the best, but once we step on the 
court, there’s no friends.”

Wolverines open Big Ten tourney

‘M’ faces Penn 
State first after 
sweeping regular-

season series

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

For the last three years, 

the same narrative has been 
written 
about 

the 
Michigan 

hockey team’s 
postseason.

Each 
of 

those 
years, 

the Wolverines 
entered 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament as 
an 
underdog 

with 
their 

season on the 
line. 
There 

were 
two 

options — win 
and go to the 
NCAA Tournament, or lose and 
go home. And each time, they 
have been faced with the latter.

But now, that ultimatum is 

gone.

Michigan 
is 
entering 
its 

conference 
tournament 
as 

the No. 2 seed, with an NCAA 
Tournament 
berth 
already 

locked 
in 
place. 
Despite 

that guarantee, though, the 
Wolverines still have plenty to 
play for.

“We’ve got three seniors who 

haven’t won the tournament,” 
said 
freshman 
defenseman 

Nicholas Boka. “It’s a big thing 
for them and 
for all of us. 
(We all) want 
to 
win 
the 

tournament for 
them.”

After 

maintaining 
the 
No. 
2 

seed 
with 
a 

dominating 
sweep of Penn 
State 
last 

weekend, the seniors’ pursuit 
of the previously unattainable 
hardware became a little bit 
easier.

The 
seeding 
guaranteed 

Michigan 
a 
first-round 
bye, 

meaning it will play its first 
game Friday against No. 3 seed 
Penn State, which defeated No. 
6 seed Wisconsin on Thursday, 

5-2. The Wolverines now have 
less than 24 hours to prepare for 
their semifinal matchup.

“This is kind of as much 

as we’re familiar with all the 
teams in our league,” Berenson 
said. “There’s not going to be 
any surprises. So it’s not who 
we’re playing, it’s how we’re 
playing.”

The biggest concern for the 

Wolverines may be the simple 

fact that they 
have a target 
on their back. 
Though they 
finished 
second 
in 

the Big Ten 
regular-
season 
standings, 
they 
are 

also the only 
team with a 

guaranteed bid to the national 
tournament.

That, 
combined 
with 
the 

fact that every other team is in 
desperation mode to earn an 
NCAA Tournament bid, could 
land Michigan in the middle 
of 
two 
dogfight 
matchups 

before it can hoist the Big Ten 
Tournament trophy.

The Wolverines are entering 

the tournament at the perfect 
time, though, and there’s no 
denying that they have the talent 
to turn a dogfight into a blowout 
very quickly.

Michigan is fresh off its sweep 

against Penn State, in which 
the Wolverines outscored the 
Nittany Lions by an aggregate 
total of 13-2. One weekend after 
conceding nine goals to Ohio 
State, the Wolverines’ defensive 
effort against Penn State was 
one of their best this season, and 
senior goaltender Steve Racine 
returned to elite form. Penn 
State likes to play fast, but all 
year, it has seemed Michigan is 
plenty capable of beating the 
Nittany Lions at their own game.

“Based on how we’ve played 

against Penn State, it would 
probably be them (that we would 
prefer), but it’s so hard to beat 
a team five times in one year,” 
said 
sophomore 
defenseman 

Zach Werenski. “It’s the Big Ten 
Tournament, I think most teams 
are fighting for an automatic 
bid in the (NCAA) Tournament. 
They have a lot to play for. Going 
into the weekend, I think we’re 
just going to stick to our game. 
We’re going to look at them a 
little bit, but it’s mainly about us, 
how we play.”

The story has finally changed 

this 
year. 
After 
an 
NCAA 

Tournament 
drought 
that 

seemed to last forever when 
stacked up against Berenson’s 
historic resume, Michigan is 
finally entering its conference 
tournament with that monkey 
off its back.

Frankly, 
the 
Wolverines 

don’t need to win the Big Ten 
Tournament. 
If 
they 
don’t, 

their season will go on. But 
they 
aren’t 
content 
with 

that. Michigan isn’t flying to 
Minneapolis for a participation 
trophy. After all, the seniors 
have had that experience three 
times too many.

“We don’t want to come 

home with our tails between 
our legs from St. Paul and 
then expect to regroup for the 
NCAA,” Berenson said. “We 
want to go there and come back 
with a championship.”

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Senior goaltender Steve Racine picked up two wins against Penn State just last weekend, giving up only one goal in each.

“We don’t want to 
come home with 
our tails between 

our legs.”

Managing Sports Editor

Two and a half months after 

the end of the 2015 Michigan 
football 
season, 
Dymonte 

Thomas still thinks about all of 
Jarrod Wilson’s mentorship.

Wilson, who started all 13 

games as a senior at free safety, 
became the de facto leader at 
the back end of the Wolverines’ 
vaunted defense. He lined up 
everyone — safeties, cornerbacks, 
even linebackers — called out 
the schemes and kept everything 
together in the secondary.

But Wilson is gone now, and 

he left Thomas in control of his 
old position.

Thomas, who came to Michigan 

as a four-star recruit out of 
Alliance, Ohio, had a tumultuous 
first two years. He moved around 
from nickelback to cornerback 
to 
linebacker, 
never 
getting 

comfortable at any of them. When 

the new coaching staff took over 
last spring, he tried a fourth 
position — safety — and finally it 
clicked, becoming his favorite spot.

“When you can focus on one 

job, you can really learn it, and you 
can really excel it and do the best 
you can,” Thomas said. “When you 
focus on one spot, you can really 
see the weaknesses and strengths 
you have at that spot, rather than 
focus on too many. Because then 
you’re like, ‘OK, at this position 
I’m good here, but I’m not good 
there,’ and then you gotta worry 
about too many things.”

Thomas spent most of last year 

as a backup strong safety, with 
redshirt junior Delano Hill as the 
backup free safety. This year, the 
two have switched, with Thomas 
poised to take over Wilson’s 
starting role.

It’s a bigger one than Thomas 

has ever had, but he couldn’t have 
had a better teacher than Wilson, 
whom Thomas has admired as a 

leader since the two played against 
each other in high school in Ohio.

“It was pretty cool, for someone 

who beat me in high school, that 
I got to play with him,” Thomas 
said. “He was being a leader for us, 
and he was always helping me, and 
telling me, ‘This is how we make 
the checks, this is how we make 
the calls.’

“Sometimes you compete for 

positions, sometimes they don’t 
want to help you. But Jarrod was 
never like that. He always wanted 
to help.”

Since their high school days, 

Thomas has soaked up everything 
that he liked about Wilson: his 
command of the defense, his job 
of calling the plays and his loose 
playing style.

But while Thomas has tried 

to live up to Wilson’s standard, 
he has also brought a leadership 
flavor of his own.

“Jarrod’s really quiet — he 

don’t really say much,” Thomas 
said. “Me, I’m really outgoing. 
I’m always trying to talk. I’m 
always trying to let people hear 
me. Jarrod was never like that, but 
when you really needed Jarrod, 
you could go talk to him about 
anything. That was pretty cool 
about Jarrod. He didn’t have to be 
very loud or anything.”

Thomas may turn up the volume, 

but he hopes to continue the 
success of Michigan’s defense last 
season under Wilson and several 
others. For that, Wilson — who still 
talks with Thomas every so often 
— has given Thomas some advice 
since he played his last game.

“You know it’s up to you this 

year,” Thomas recalled Wilson 
telling him. “You gotta make the 
right checks. You gotta make the 
right calls. You gotta get people 
lined up. Everyone’s going to 
count on you and look at you, and 
you know if anything goes bad, 
everyone’s going to blame you, so 
you might as well make the right 
checks and make the right calls. 
Get everyone lined up, play fast 
and have fun.”

It was a big responsibility 

Wilson placed on Thomas, but 
after three years of learning, 
Thomas is ready to be the mentor 
in his own right.
