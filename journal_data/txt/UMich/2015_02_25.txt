CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Trip comes after 

Snyder recommends 
2 percent increase 
for higher education

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel spent Tuesday afternoon 
in Lansing meeting with mem-
bers of the state Senate and House 
Appropriations Subcommittees on 
Higher Education.

Schlissel and several other state 

university leaders, including the 
chancellors of the University’s 
Flint and Dearborn campuses, 
addressed Gov. Rick Snyder’s 
higher education budget recom-
mendation during the meeting, 
with a focus on his proposed 
funding to higher education.

Schlissel voiced appreciation 

for Snyder’s proposed 2 percent 
increase in higher education 
funding and the state’s contin-

ued interest in the University’s 
work.

In the first budget of Snyder’s 

term, colleges and universities 
saw a 15 percent cut to higher 
education funding. Though Sny-
der has increased funding levels 
incrementally each year, the cuts 
came during a time when high-
er education funding already 
faced a declining trend. Univer-
sity President Emerita Mary Sue 
Coleman frequently made simi-
lar trips to Lansing to emphasize 
the importance of state funding.

Schlissel noted that Michigan 

residents support higher educa-
tion as “a pathway to prosper-
ity,” a belief he observed while 
traveling around the state last 
summer before beginning his 
term as University president.

During Tuesday’s meeting, 

he said he was impressed by the 
state’s beauty, history and focus 
on the future. He added that 
residents’ pride in state univer-
sities and colleges was apparent 
over the course of the trip, dur-

Revival of #UMDivest 

initiative calls for 
examination of ‘U’ 

investments 

By EMILY MIILLER

Daily Staff Writer

Students Allied for Freedom 

and Equality — the University 
chapter of the activist group Stu-

dents for Justice in Palestine — 
read a new divestment resolution 
Tuesday during the Divestment 
and Sanctions Symposium. Orga-
nizers intend to bring before the 
Central Student Government.

The resolution calls for CSG 

to support the creation of a com-
mittee through the University’s 
Board of Regents to examine the 
ethics of the University’s invest-
ments, specifically in companies 
that allegedly facilitate the viola-
tions of Palestinian human rights. 

The resolution calls on the regents 
to divest University endowment 
holdings from Caterpillar Inc., 
The Boeing Company, G4S and 
the United Technologies Corpo-
ration.

SAFE advocated for a similar 

divestment resolution last March 
that failed to pass in CSG. The 
vote brought hundreds of individ-
uals both supporting and oppos-
ing the divestment resolution to 
the Michigan Union during the 
CSG vote.

LSA senior Sami Shalabi, a 

member of SAFE, said the group is 
trying to approach the resolution 
differently this year.

“We’re 
mainly 
steering 

towards focusing on the compa-
nies that are socially irrespon-
sible,” Shalabi said. “We’re trying 
to take the emotion out of it and 
present facts.”

Following the reading, there 

was an opportunity for those in 
attendance to provide their input

University prof. 

establishes system 
to increase student 

risk-taking

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

When Education Prof. Barry 

Fishman walks into one of his 
classes, he uses a program called 
GradeCraft in which students 
begin with a grade of 0 percent and 
have the ability to build up their 
grade as high as they desire.

This is a far cry from typical 

first-day-of-class speeches, Fish-
man, who is also a professor in the 
School of Information, explained. 
Most professors tend to tell their 
students that they begin class with 
an A+ and the grade is theirs to 
lose.

“It’s 
incredibly 
problematic 

because once someone says that, 
all you can do is lose points,” Fish-
man said. “So say you do a fabulous 
job on your first paper and get a 99 
percent. While that’s great, you 
don’t have 100 percent anymore 
and you never will again.”

GradeCraft, an online learning 

platform created at the University 
and designed to complement sites 
such as CTools and Canvas, pres-
ents a potential solution to this 
problem by making grades some-
thing to win.

According to Fishman, there 

are two types of learning environ-
ments that involve gaming and the 
classroom: what he calls “gami-
fication” and having a “gameful 
classroom.”

Gamification is taking an exist-

ing system and giving it game-like 
features to force people into doing 
specific tasks. Fishman does not 
support this method of teaching, 
and compared it to the advertising 
incentive methods used by airline 
companies.

“Maybe you don’t love Delta Air 

Lines but you’ve got a lot of fre-
quent flyer miles so you’re going 
to fly Delta,” Fishman explained. 
“They’ve got you because you’re 
kind of trapped in their points sys-
tem.”

He called this method ineffec-

tive because it does not allow for 
people to take the course of action 
they actually desire.

In contrast to gamification, the

Governor’s plan 
includes renewed 

emphasis on 

community c ollege

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Following statewide elections 

in which higher education was 
a point of debate, this article is 
the second in a series examining 
the changing landscape of higher 

education funding in Michigan, 
and what those changes mean for 
four-year universities.

When 
Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder 

delivered his State of the State 
address in January, he discussed 
career technical training pro-
grams, associate’s degrees, dual 
enrollment and other higher 
education pathways.

“One of our goals is to be 

number one in skilled trade 
training,” Snyder announced in 
the address.

However, while he made a 

point to emphasize these pro-

grams in the address, the gov-
ernor did not mention any of the 
state’s four-year colleges and 
universities.

Snyder’s focus on options 

beyond 
four-year 
universi-

ties isn’t new. Over his tenure, 
among other initiatives, the 
governor has introduced a new 
apprenticeship program in the 
state. As part of the GOP agen-
da, this legislative session has 
featured bills to increase dual 
enrollment opportunities for 
high school students.

Ackerman to face 
incumbent member 
in August’s Ward 3 
Democratic primary

By EMMA KERR

Daily News Editor

In a city where the City Council 

wards split Ann Arbor’s student 
population five ways, LSA senior 
Zachary Ackerman declared his 
candidacy Tuesday for a seat on 
the Ann Arbor City Council.

Ackerman, a Democrat and 

Ann Arbor native, will run in 
Ward 3 for a seat currently held 
by Councilmember Stephen Kun-
selman (D–Ward 3).

In an interview with The Michi-

gan Daily, Ackerman said by age 15 
he had already found a passion for 
local government and was inspired 
by his experience shadowing Ann 
Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor 
(D), then a city councilmember.

Ackerman said his interest in 

civic engagement played a key 
role in moving him toward run-
ning for city council.

Now 21 years old, Ackerman

BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING

MSU is one of the last Big 

Ten schools to establish a Bio-
medical Engineering program, 
The State News reported. The 
program was approved by the 
MSU Board of Trustees in 
October 2014 and officially 
became part of the program on 
Jan. 1, 2015.

While 
biomedical 
engi-

neering has been available for 
engineering students as a con-
centration for several years 
— in the chemical, materials 
science, biosystems, mechani-
cal, electrical and computer 
engineering departments — it 
didn’t become a department of 
its own until now.

The dean of MSU’s College 

of Engineering said the col-

lege is currently in the pro-
cess of hiring a chairperson 
and assigning faculty. Their 
goal is to offer a graduate pro-
gram beginning January 2016, 
though it will likely be sev-
eral years before they have the 
resources to offer an under-
graduate program.

University of Pennsylvania 
professors protest school’s 

new sexual misconduct 

policy

Last week, 16 professors at 

the University of Pennsylvania 
Law School released an open 
letter criticizing the school’s 
newly revised sexual assault 
policy, The Washington Post 

reported. The professors’ pri-
mary concern was insufficient 
procedures to ensure due pro-
cess and a fair trial for students 
accused of sexual assault.

“We do not believe that pro-

viding justice for victims of 
sexual assault requires sub-
ordinating so many protec-
tions long deemed necessary 
to protect from injustice those 
accused of serious offenses,” 
the letter stated.

The brief argues that the 

new policies have “sacrificed 
the traditional safeguards that 
accompany 
traditional 
law-

making procedures.”

CSG Assembly endorses new 
spirit song ‘Hail and Unite’

Resolution to fund 

Dining Dollar 

donation program 

also discussed

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

In its final meeting before 

Spring Break, the Central Student 
Government Assembly cemented 
its support of the “Hail and Unite” 
spirit song, in addition to listening 
to a proposal for the body to fund 
promotional materials for a new 
food donation program.

Hail and Unite

The new spirit song, which 

had been discussed at the pre-
vious two assembly meetings, 
made a third appearance Tues-
day night as “Hail and Unite” 
creator Mike Weinberg, an LSA 
senior, reintroduced a resolution 
for CSG to endorse the project.

In a vote following Wein-

berg’s 
presentation 
to 
the 

assembly, which included the 
screening of a promotional video 

for the movement, the resolution 
passed.

When the “Hail and Unite” 

team first introduced the proj-
ect, they asked the assembly for 
$2,750 to fund the promotional 
video — a resolution that was 
referred to the finance commit-
tee.

However, because Weinberg 

and his team felt that “Hail and 
Unite” accrued negative feed-
back from the University com-
munity following its launch, 
they withdrew the resolution 
from CSG’s consideration.

“We decided that given what 

was happening, we should just 
start over, come back in so I 
could explain the real story, and 
clarify what exactly ‘Hail and 
Unite’ is,” Weinberg said in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily.

The new resolution asked 

CSG for its endorsement, not 
funding, and includes language 
to express that the goal of the 
project is to unite and ener-
gize the University community. 
This addition responds to con-
cerns that the spirit song would 
replace “The Victors.”

Weinberg, 
and 
Business 

sophomore Adam Weiss, a CSG 
representative who introduced 
the original “Hail and Unite” 
resolution, wrote the new legis-
lation.

“We really wanted to clarify 

that ‘The Victors’ and what we 
are doing couldn’t be further 
apart,” Weinberg said.

He declined to disclose which 

organizations have guaranteed 
support for the song, though he 
said he is in negotiations with 
a variety of departments and 
schools at the University.

Now that the resolution has 

passed, Weinberg said he wants 
to continue to share accurate 
information about what “Hail 
and Unite” actually is with the 
University community.

“If we heard that someone 

was trying to do something with 
‘The Victors’ or a fight song, or 
something that wasn’t com-
pletely organic to the University 
of Michigan, we would be furi-
ous too,” he said. “I ask that peo-
ple be willing to listen and hear 
what we’re actually doing.”

Flynn suggests that live

Canadian study 
focuses on ‘risky’ 

intercourse between 

homosexual men

SEATTLE (AP) — For the first 

time, a study shows that a drug 
used to treat HIV infection also 
can help prevent it when taken 
before and after risky sex by gay 
men.

The results offer hope of a 

more appealing way to help pre-
vent the disease beyond taking 
daily pills and using condoms, 
although those methods are still 
considered best.

The study, done in France and 

Canada, is the first to test “on 
demand” use of Truvada, a pill 
combining two AIDS drugs, by 
people planning to have risky 
sex. The uninfected men who 
took it were 86 percent less like-
ly to get HIV compared to men 

given dummy pills.

“That impressed me,” Dr. 

Scott Hammer said of the size of 
the benefit. He is an AIDS spe-
cialist at Columbia University 
in New York and heads the Ret-
rovirus Conference going on in 
Seattle, where the results were 
discussed Tuesday.

Daily Truvada pills are used 

now to prevent HIV infec-
tion in people at high risk for 
it, and studies show the drug 
helps even when some doses 
are skipped. Health officials 
have been leery of billing it as a 
“chemical condom” out of fear 
that people will not use the 
best prevention methods, but 
many won’t use condoms all 
the time or take daily pills.

The study of Gilead Sci-

ence’s Truvada was led by the 
French national HIV research 
agency.

Men were given fake or real 

Truvada and told to take two 
pills from two to 24 hours 
before sex, a third pill 24 hours 
later, and a fourth pill 48 hours 
after the first dose. The men 
also were given condoms and 
disease prevention counseling.

The study was stopped early, 

in November, after 400 men 
were enrolled and researchers 
saw that the drug was working; 
there were two new HIV infec-
tions among those on Truvada 
and 14 in those on dummy pills. 
The two infections in the Tru-
vada group were in men who 
stopped using the pills after 
more than a year in the study.

The drug was safe, but nau-

sea and diarrhea were more 
frequent among men who used 
it. Only one stopped using it 
because of side effects.

Dr. Susan Buchbinder, an 

AIDS specialist at the San 
Francisco Department of Pub-
lic Health, called the results 
exciting but warned that it 
can’t be assumed they would 
apply 
to 
male-female 
sex, 

because different types of sex 
expose partners to differing 
amounts of virus.

“After we divested from South 

Africa, when that happened, if you 
look in the University records, 
what they wanted to do was to 
create a committee to look at 
our investments,” Khamis said. 
“Unfortunately, that hasn’t been 
the case, and that doesn’t exist.”

The resolution cites United 

Nations 
Security 
Resolution 

242 and various University poli-
cies, including the University’s 
divestments from South African 
apartheid in 1978 and tobacco 
companies in 2000, as the reason-
ing for creating the committee.

If the committee is formed and 

decides the University should 
divest from the companies, the 
four corporations would be given 
a year’s warning to change the 
policies deemed unethical. The 
University 
would 
discontinue 

investing in the companies if 
these changes were not imple-
mented.

Apart from SAFE, members of 

the University’s Divest to Invest 
group gathered on the Diag ear-
lier this month to call for the Uni-
versity’s divestment from fossil 
fuels.

However, according to Univer-

sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald, 
the threshold for passing a divest-
ment policy is purposefully diffi-
cult to reach.

“The bar is set intentionally 

high ... to somewhat insulate 
the investment office from the 
political winds that could change 
from one direction to the other,” 
Fitzgerald said in an interview 
last year. “So the bar for consider-
ing divesting is set intentionally 
very high and requires this broad 
pervasive sentiment throughout 
University community to even be 
considered.”

Prior to the reading of the 

resolution, various booths pro-
vided information on the history 
of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict 
and information about the SAFE 
movement.

Khamis said the symposium 

sought to raise awareness and 
understanding about the conflict, 
as well as encourage students to 
instigate change.

“It’s about what you can do 

right now,” Khamis said.

LSA senior Daniel Hurwitz-

Goodman, a member of Jewish 
Voice for Peace, attended the 
event in support of SAFE and the 
divestment movement.

“I think that the idea of hav-

ing education and feedback at the 
forefront is an important aspect 
of getting something like this 
actually passed rather than just 
talked about,” Hurwitz-Good-
man said.

While he’s also spent time 

addressing 
four-year 
schools, 

these initiatives have caught the 
attention of educational institu-
tions around Michigan, many of 
whom are wondering what this 
new emphasis will mean for their 
future.

Give and take?

In public appearances over his 

tenure, the governor has stressed 
that his focus is on bringing more 
career readiness to the states’ 
higher education offerings, not 
taking something away.

Speaking at his annual educa-

tion summit last March, Snyder 
said he wants higher education to 
adopt a broader approach in pre-
paring students for the workforce.

“(Michigan education) is too 

often focused on a diploma or a 
degree, and not saying, ‘Are you 
career ready?’” he said at the time.

In a public appearance in 

Macomb late last year, Snyder said 
the idea individuals need a college 
degree has been reinforced too 
much, and he wants to swing the 
balance back, The Macomb Daily 
reported.

“The part we messed up is that 

we didn’t say with equal fervor and 
equal passion (to teens) that you 
should also look at skilled trades 
and you should look at career tech-
ed … the whole country messed up 
on this issue and we were a part of 
messing up on this issue.”

Many higher education poli-

cymakers and university officials 
across the state say they are opti-
mistic about that idea of an addi-
tion, not a replacement, especially 
in regards to how those programs 
are funded in the state budget.

In Snyder’s fiscal year 2016 

budget recommendation this Feb-
ruary, he doubled the amount of 
money allocated to skilled trades 
programs — from $10 million to 
$20 million. However, appropria-
tions for universities and colleges 
also received an increase of 2 per-
cent, in line with previous increas-
es over the past few years.

Cynthia Wilbanks, the Univer-

sity’s vice president for govern-
ment relations, said in an interview 
before the budget’s release that 
she did not believe universities 
would have to make concessions 
as a result of increased attention to 
trades programs.

“I am very reluctant to iden-

tify the governor’s focus as being 

singly focused, and an either or 
proposition where winners and 
losers are identified as coming 
out of that kind of a discussion,” 
Wilbanks said. “I prefer to think 
about the governor’s comments as 
not an either-or opportunity, and 
I think that’s really important. 
What I think people will try to 
do on occasion is divide and con-
quer: if we just put more resourc-
es into this area of education, 
that means someone else is going 
to lose out. And I do not believe 
that is the intention of the gover-
nor and other policy makers.”

State Rep. Amanda Price (R–

Holland), chair of the House 
Education Committee, said she 
sees skilled trades programs as 
a way to better match student 
needs.

“Some people are going to 

feel that their skills are served 
better by four-year universi-
ties, and they want to go in that 
direction,” she said. “A lot of 
kids … they know they’re going 
to work with their hands, or 
know they’re going to work in 
the skilled trades and then that’s 
a better fit for them. So I think 
it’s finding what is the best fit for 
that individual, as opposed to a 
zero-sum game.”

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–

Ann Arbor), who serves on the 
Appropriations subcommittee on 
Higher Education, said while he 
did not think that the increased 
attention 
towards 
alternative 

higher education routes would 
have an impact on university 
funding, it’s hard to ever be sure.

“I don’t personally see a direct 

conflict between that and uni-
versity funding,” he said. “Of 
course there’s always a conflict 
between any funding line and 
another. I would see that more 
as a conflict than say, our cor-
rections expenses.”

Speaking before the budget 

recommendation release, Dale 
Tahtinen, vice president of gov-
ernment relations at Michigan 
Technological University, said 
he thinks the impact on a uni-
versity’s budget would depend 
on the focus of that university’s 
programs.

“Hopefully 
(the 
financial 

impact) will be minimal, but 
it may have an impact, prob-
ably on some more than others 
depending on what they offer,” 
Tahtinen said.

MAT2

The governor’s push for 

career education has manifest-

ed in several distinct ways.

During his State of the State 

address, Snyder highlighted one 
of his earliest initiatives — the 
Michigan 
Advanced 
Techni-

cal Training Program. MAT2 
launched in 2013, after the gover-
nor observed a similar program 
during a 2012 visit to Germany.

Ryan Hundt, a senior program 

manager for the Michigan Eco-
nomic Development Corpora-
tion’s Talent Enhancement unit, 
runs MAT2, which combines 
both job training and in-class-
room learning. He said when it 
comes to Michigan, the program 
is the first of its kind.

“There have been apprentice-

ship programs around the state 
and around the country for quite 
some time,” he said. “The MAT2 
program was modeled on the 
German dual education system, 
and the German dual education 
system kind of blends compo-
nents of a traditional classroom 
setting with employer on-the-job 
training.”

What makes the MAT2 pro-

gram unique, he said, is that it is 
employer-driven, based on con-
necting students with potential 
future employers, rather than 
only teaching job skills.

MAT2 currently is involved 

in three community colleges on 
four college campuses: Macomb 
Community College at their south 
campus in Warren, Oakland Com-
munity College on the Auburn 
Hills and Orchard Ridge cam-
puses, and Henry Ford College in 
Dearborn.

More than 90 students are cur-

rently enrolled.

In 2013, MAT2 had partnered 

with Oakland Community Col-
lege and Henry Ford Community 

College and only offered a mecha-
tronics program, with just 31 stu-
dents enrolled. In 2014, with the 
governor’s support, the programs 
expanded to include Macomb 
Community College, adding a 
technical product design program, 
an information technology pro-
gram and enrolling more than an 
additional 60 students.

This year, MAT2 plans to 

expand to both include a new 
technician program, and move 
outside of the Southeast Michigan.

“We’re planning on partnering 

with Lansing Community College, 
Kalamazoo Valley Community 
College, Delta College in Saginaw, 
North Central Community Col-
lege in Petoskey and Baker College 
in Cadillac,” Hundt said. “We’re 
hoping that MAT2 is not just an 
educational and training model for 
Michigan, but we’re hoping that it 
can be replicated throughout the 
U.S. at some point as well.”

Hundt said he saw several ben-

efits to the governor’s focus on the 
skilled trades, including increased 
awareness of them as options.

“It also makes programs like 

MAT2 seem like a viable educa-
tional aid career option,” Hundt 
said. “Especially for students that 
may not necessarily know what 
they’d like to do after high school, 
or they may be interested in a par-
ticular field but they don’t neces-
sarily want to go off to a four-year 
college or a university.”

Participant Rebekka Neumann 

said she fell in this category, and 
was encouraged by her teachers 
and robotics team coaches to join 
the MAT2 program after gradua-
tion.

ing which he met with leaders of 
startup companies born out of 
University research and a hand-
ful of local non-profits.

Schlissel stressed the Uni-

versity’s deep connection to the 
state, highlighting its commit-
ment to meeting 100 percent 
of demonstrated financial need 
for all in-state students. He said 
that commitment has made the 
University more affordable than 
it was five years ago for in-state 
students that demonstrate finan-
cial need.

This was a point Coleman 

made in a February 2013 speech 
to the House Appropriations Sub-
committee on Higher Education. 
Snyder’s budget proposal that 
year also provided for modest 
funding increases for public state 

universities; Coleman said this 
allowed for continuing improve-
ment of the University’s financial 
aid programs.

“Only one (University) bud-

get item is sacrosanct and that 
is financial aid; here we are add-
ing dollars,” she said. “This year 
alone, we invested $137 million 
for financial aid. We are very, 
very deliberate when targeting 
savings on campus — the kind of 
precision you might experience in 
an advanced course in nano-engi-
neering or microsurgery.”

Schlissel also cited the Uni-

versity’s collaborations with the 
state’s automotive, technology, 
urban planning and insurance 
industries. For example, he noted 
the University is currently work-
ing with government and educa-
tion officials to build a 32-acre 
mobility transformation center 
to develop automated, driverless 
vehicles.

will graduate from the University 
in December — a semester late due 
to a brief stint working as a depu-
ty field director for Rep. Debbie 
Dingell’s campaign during the sec-
ond half of 2014.

After leading a volunteer group 

during Taylor’s campaign for 
mayor last year, Ackerman said 
his experience working on vari-
ous campaigns has taught him the 
importance of dedication to one’s 
constituents.

“You learn how to really engage 

in the community and you learn 
how to really be active and present, 
and you learn that combination of 
thoughtfulness, open-mindedness, 
and a data-driven, progressive 
approach to governance,” he said.

When deciding whether to run, 

Ackerman considered what he 
could offer to the community. He 
said he aspires to be a leader, but 
one that promotes civic engage-
ment rather than a personal agen-
da.

“As a civic leader, I want to 

make 
municipal 
government 

more accessible and understand-
able to constituents,” Ackerman 

said. “We need to invest primar-
ily in our infrastructure and basic 
services. We can’t do those things 
well enough. As a community 
leader, I want to make Ann Arbor 
more accessible and attractive to 
residents. To achieve that qual-
ity of life, we need to invest in our 
people.”

Ackerman said the type of peo-

ple the city caters to and attracts 
is important, and subsequently 
he hopes his more youthful per-
spective will provide insights into 
how the city can best attract and 
keep young professionals. He also 
emphasized that he is interested in 
collaboration and respecting dif-
fering ideas — values he said reflect 
the spirit of Ann Arbor.

Vying for the seat held by 

incumbent Councilmember Ste-
phen Kunselman (D–Ward 3), 
Ackerman said he aspires to bring 
open-mindedness to City Council.

“I find (Kunselman) to be not 

necessarily the most collaborative 
person, and I think a lot of people 
who work in city politics, includ-
ing city staff, and a lot of residents 
would agree with that. I don’t 
think he comes to the table with 
a sense of open-mindedness that 
I believe is necessary to help make 
Ann Arbor fully functional.”

Kunselman did not wish to 

comment on these remarks at this 
time, but said he is planning to run 
a full, competitive campaign for 
re-election in the coming months.

Ackerman said one issue he 

has noticed that requires more 
attention is homelessness and the 
resources available to create more 
permanent solutions, including 
shelters and affordable housing.

“We have to make sure Ann 

Arbor is accessible to anyone who 
wants to call Ann Arbor home,” he 
said.

In addition to considering new 

locations for possible affordable 
housing units, Ackerman said 
the Delonis Center — a shelter 
that offers temporary housing 
for those who need it — could 
be restructured to better serve 
Washtenaw County residents. The 
shelter is currently funded in part 
by the state, which means it has to 
accept any Michigan resident.

“(The 
Delonis 
Center) 
has 

become the homeless shelter for 
the greater southeast area,” Ack-
erman said. “We need to take a 
look at how we fund the Delonis 
Center in a way that allows us to 
focus on Washtenaw County and 
Ann Arbor residents so that we 
can provide not only a temporary 

shelter for people but also any 
social support they need while on 
their way to permanent housing 
and a place in Ann Arbor’s work-
force.”

Ackerman said encouraging an 

increase in affordable housing — 
an issue he said he will approach 
with a unique perspective — is 
necessary in Ann Arbor.

Amid lengthy debate, City 

Council has been working to 
update zoning protocols, an issue 
Taylor emphasized during the 
mayoral race and one Ackerman 
agreed still requires attention. 
The construction of high-rise 
apartment buildings has attract-
ed extensive debate in recent 
years.

Considering both student needs 

and residential needs, Ackerman 
said he is prepared to come to the 
table with fresh ideas and a unique 
outlook in the conversation about 
housing and downtown develop-
ment.

“I think there were some over-

sights in the zoning process that 
began in 2007,” Ackerman said. 
“Zoning can be done better to 
make sure Ann Arbor stays the 
historic and attractive skyline we 
want — like considering a buf-
fer zone between residents and 

downtown, staggering heights, 
things like that.”

Ackerman also suggested find-

ing innovative approaches to 
affordable housing, such as pro-
moting accessory units, or small 
dwellings attached to single-fam-
ily homes that are often rented at 
more affordable rates.

“This is just supplemental, but 

it’s creative and communal,” he 
said. “There are a lot of issues at 
play when you talk about afford-
ability and the student body. “

As an employee of the Univer-

sity’s Information and Technology 
Services, Ackerman said he hopes 
his knowledge and perspective 
will help bring Ann Arbor as a city 
into the 21st century.

“In terms of road repair, there 

are a lot more proactive measures 
that we can take.” he said. “In 
terms of problem reporting, places 
like Jackson are experimenting 
with civic applications for your 
phones.”

Ackerman said there is a notice-

able divide among members of 
Council, preventing the body from 
taking more progressive initia-
tives.

“I would say that AA politics 

is more factionalized than it has 
been,” Ackerman said.”There are 

those that want to take a forward 
looking lens to municipal govern-
ment and there are those who 
want to look at the short term and 
what will serve their benefit in the 
immediate.”

Students have struggled to 

secure a seat on Council for years. 
The Mixed Use party focused on 
adopting a more relaxed zoning 
code, and ran several several Uni-
versity students for Council in the 
2013 election. In 2014, LSA fresh-
man Sam McMullen ran for a seat 
on council as well. These attempts 
proved unsuccessful.

This year, University alum Will 

Leaf, a former co-chair of the 
Mixed Use party, will run also for 
a seat on council.

According to a Daily analysis 

last month, 14.72 percent of Ward 
3 consists of students who are 
registered voters. Of the 7,000 
students registered to vote, only 
1,900 voted in the 2014 Ann Arbor 
election.

Ackerman, however, said he 

won’t be relying too heavily on 
student support at the polls, but 
rather hopes to reach out to com-
munity members in his ward, run-
ning a grassroots campaign and 
going door-to-door.

second method, which is used in 
GradeCraft, is known as a “game-
ful classroom.” Theorized to foster 
a better learning environment in 
the classroom, the model attempts 
to encourage students to take risks.

“I would actually claim that all 

of school is a game right now — 
it’s just a terrible game,” Fishman 
said. “My job is to figure out what 
makes it such a terrible game and 
what I can do to make it into a bet-
ter game.”

Fishman said his inspiration for 

“gameful learning” can be found in 
very successful video games.

“They have been designed very 

well to get people very engaged and 
want to try very difficult things,” 
he said. “They’re set up to encour-

age you to take risks and even if 
that means you’re going to fail, the 
cost of failure isn’t so critical — if 
your character dies, you’ll get a new 
character.”

Fishman said students’ fear 

of failure is what inspired him to 
create an online learning system 
where students can determine 
their goals and grades for their 
own classes.

“High school used to be prepa-

ration for college and now it’s 
preparation for applying to col-
lege,” Fishman said. “The result is 
you’ll end up in college and you’re 
so used to be doing exactly what 
you’re supposed to do that you’re 
not sure how to take a risk. But 
failure is super important.”

With these ideas in mind, Fish-

man created GradeCraft. The plat-
form currently serves over 1,400 
students in 15 classes at the Uni-

versity and two at the University 
of Michigan—Dearborn in disci-
plines ranging from kinesiology to 
linguistics.

The site allows students to view 

their assignments, course prog-
ress, grade predictor, badges and 
teaching teams.

Students are able to choose 

which assignments they want 
to do and see how the preferred 
assignments 
will 
affect 
their 

grade.

Fishman said the key to the 

platform is the grade predictor. 
The predictor allows students 
to view their cumulative points 
within a class and alter the assign-
ments they elect based on the 
feedback they receive from their 
instructor.

“Everything is optional — even 

attendance,” Fishman said. “It 
also allows students to have free-

dom to fail. If you don’t do well on 
an assignment, you can try some-
thing else.”

Fishman said he believes the 

greatest problem with students 
using the site is their early anxi-
ety after assessing the amount of 
work required for a GradeCraft 
course. However, he said Gra-
deCraft allows instructors to look 
for “cues” that may hint at a future 
poor performance by the student.

“I have a different interface 

that lets me see how students are 
doing,” Fishman said. “It lets me 
analyze at what point students 
begin to fall into trouble.”

Fishman said interest in Gra-

deCraft is growing among educa-
tors from all over the world.

“We get half-a-dozen requests 

per week from people who want 
to use it,” he said. “We’re not 
ready for the outside world to use 

it yet.”

In an e-mail interview, Infor-

mation junior Monica Chen said 
GradeCraft is unlike any other 
online learning platform because 
it fuses the concepts of competi-
tion and cooperation together. 
Because the system is so complex, 
the success of the program is left 
largely to the professor.

“The badge system might not 

be tweaked or implemented at all, 
the scale of points might be too 
low to inspire dedicated work, 
there might not be a theme or 
leveler scheme as encourage-
ment, and depth of information 
as a whole might be inadequate, 
among other things,” Chen said.

Rackham student Ryan Wawr-

zaszek, a former student of Fish-
man’s as an undergraduate, said 
in an e-mail interview that the 
benefits of GradeCraft lie in the 

flexibility students have in choos-
ing what work to do outside of the 
classroom.

“In Professor Fishman’s class, 

every assignment was optional, so 
you were able to pick and choose 
which assignments seemed more 
interesting to you,” Wawrzaszek 
said. “GradeCraft made it easy to 
plan out the semester by clearly 
showing due dates, assignment 
specifications, grading rubrics 
and point values right at the 
beginning of the semester.”

Wawrzaszek added that the 

grade predictor helped him man-
age his assignments.

“It was nice to have a clear but 

flexible list of assignments right 
from the start and to also have an 
option to do an extra assignment 
or two if I didn’t do as well as I 
had hoped on one of the projects I 
picked out at the start,” he wrote.

O

f all the relationships in my life, the 
one I have with my body is the most 
turbulent. My body image, over the 

years, 
has 
continually 

fluctuated. 
Honestly, 

strike that. It alters daily. 
Depending 
on 
the 
day, 

my perceptions can range 
from vaguely accepting, to 
indifferent, to criticisms I’d 
never dare direct at another 
person. I’d like to say I’m 
entirely comfortable in my 
own skin. I’d like to say that 
when my gaze meets the 
one of the woman staring 
back at me from the surface of a brightly lit 
mirror, I don’t grimace. I’d like to take a photo 
with friends without a self-conscious and 
disparaging thought creeping into my head.

I struggle whenever I try to decipher the 

roles bodies play in our lives and in society 
as a whole. I’d prefer to view bodies as 
merely vehicles to breathe, travel, play, work, 
create, love and enjoy life. However, I know 
perceptions surrounding the physical body in 
our society are far more complex than that. 
Whether we’re being introduced to someone 
or merely sitting in class, our bodies are one of 
the first impressions we make. From that initial 
moment, we begin the process of appraising, 
or “sizing each other up.” In our society, we 
classify and compartmentalize. We toss around 
adjectives like “tall,” “stout,” “lean,” “twiggy,” 
“chubby,” “athletic” or “muscular.” We fix these 
designations on people until the descriptions 
seep under our skin. We formulate idealized 
classifications of bodies that deserve to be 
labeled as healthy or as attractive. We even 
create incorrect images of what individuals 
struggling 
with 
their 

bodies look like.

Yet 
eating 
disorders 

and body image concerns 
afflict individuals across 
a wide spectrum that’s 
overlooked far too often. 
Despite 
the 
common 

misconception that eating 
disorders 
only 
affect 

individuals who are young, 
white, 
heterosexuals, 

they’re not exclusive to any particular group. 
Classified by the fifth edition of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
as “persistent disturbance(s) of eating or 
eating-related behavior that results in the 
altered consumption or absorption of food 
that significantly impairs physical health or 
psychosocial functioning,” eating disorders 
are experienced by individuals of any age, 
sexuality, gender, race or socioeconomic status.

In order to address the discrepancies and 

misconceptions about disordered eating across 
the nation, the National Eating Disorder 
Association recently kicked off National Eating 
Disorder Awareness Week by surrounding the 
campaign around the phrase “I Had No Idea.” 
Personal experiences and interactions have 
convinced me the stereotypical images and 
perceptions of eating disorders are not true, 
but until I did the research, I was unaware of 
numerous aspects regarding the subject.

Even though the DSM offers detailed 

definitions and symptom descriptions of 
eating disorders, the information and research 
surrounding the discussion is constantly 
evolving. Binge-eating disorder — a type of 
eating disorder characterized by “frequent 
episodes of consuming large amounts of food, 
but without behaviors to prevent weight 
gain” — previously fell under a category of 
non-specified disorders. The emergence of 
this disorder into the manual shows eating 
disorders aren’t limited to anorexia and bulimia. 
Likewise, the existence of other-specified and 
unspecified categories in the DSM helps to 
reinforce the fact that eating disorders vary as 

much as the individuals who suffer from them. 
A variety of diverse sociocultural and genetic 
factors contribute to the development of eating 
disorders and the manifestation of symptoms 
in individuals.

For example, eating disorders — although 

they are commonly categorized as an issue 
pertaining mostly to women — greatly impact 
men. In the past 30 years, the percentage of 
men who are dissatisfied with their bodies has 
risen from 15 percent to 43 percent. For binge-
eating disorder, in particular, men compose 
40 percent of the individuals diagnosed. 
Men who exhibit signs of binging episodes or 
symptoms of bulimia may partake in excessive 
amounts of exercising. While women may 
focus on slimming down, men with disordered 
eating patterns focus on maintaining a more 
stereotypically masculine form by obtaining 
muscle. The stigma of eating disorders being 
exclusively associated with women deters men 
from seeking treatment.

In addition, gender roles and stereotypes 

play a role in the manifestation of eating 
disorder symptoms in members of the LGBTQ 
community. According to NEDA, stressors, 
“such as coming out and harassment in school 
or in the workplace, can impact levels of anxiety, 
depression, low self-esteem, and unhealthy 
coping mechanisms such as substance abuse 
— all of which are common co-occurring 
conditions and can be contributing factors to 
the development of an eating disorder.”

For members of the transgender community, 

attempting to obtain a masculine or feminine 
ideal could provoke anxiety and dissatisfaction 
with one’s body. Research regarding aspects 
such as the idealized forms in LGBTQ 
community, the effects of discrimination, and 
the factors contributing to eating disorders is 

still ongoing.

Taking 
excessive 

exercise and gender roles 
into account, many people 
may 
consider 
athletes 

exempt 
from 
eating 

disorders 
as 
result 
of 

their strenuous exercise 
schedules 
mandated 
by 

their 
respective 
sport. 

However, appearances can 
be deceiving. The stress of 

competition, of maintaining the form of one’s 
body and of wanting to improve can contribute 
to the development of an eating disorder. 
Likewise, in aesthetic sports like gymnastics, 
wrestling and ice-skating, the form-fitting 
uniforms participants are expected to wear can 
increase one’s concern about the way their body 
looks to others.

In an environment like the University — 

where competition, independence and high 
standards thrive — students may refrain from 
seeking help or feel like the condition is a phase 
they can struggle through and improve on their 
own. However, numerous resources — at CAPS 
and UHS — exist to assist students with each 
variable of eating disorders and body image 
concerns.

Just as a culmination of diverse factors 

can contribute to the development of eating 
disorders, many diverse approaches need be 
taken to increase awareness about the wide 
variation of body concerns among students. 
There is no immediate solution for the 
widespread prevalence of eating disorders, but 
there are numerous steps that can be taken 
to raise awareness. The first is to increase 
our knowledge of these conditions. Raising 
awareness, learning more about diverse 
populations 
affected 
and 
understanding 

symptoms can help in removing inhibiting 
stigmas and allowing people to begin to view 
their bodies outside of restricting, incorrect 
idealizations.

Thank you, Victoria’s 

Secret Angels

TO THE DAILY: 

I’m not a size two. My stomach 

isn’t as flat as a washboard when I 
sit down. I enjoy an occasional slice 
of pizza. I’m already well aware 
that I’m not destined to model, or 
marry a hot rock star, or be the face 
of some cosmetic line. But full dis-
closure: I’m not one who doesn’t 
know the difference between Top-
shop and Top Cat, and I don’t cause 
passersby to shriek in horror as I 
walk past their gaze.

As I stared at my laptop with an 

empty Cheez-It bag in front of me, 
an article from Harper’s Bazaar 
was conveniently, or perhaps incon-
veniently, brought to my atten-
tion by a friend. It read, “If you’re 
bummed about waiting a full year 

for the next Victoria’s Secret Fash-
ion Show, today’s news is sure to lift 
your spirits.”

Wow, 
Harper’s 
Bazaar, 
you 

really speak to me, don’t you? I’m 
a 19-year-old, stressed-out col-
lege freshman who gets bummed 
out by bad grades, disappointment 
and not knowing what I want to 
do with my life. But I will never 
be bummed about having to wait a 
full year (gasp!) to see the entranc-
ing, immortal, glamazon Victoria’s 
Secret models grace the catwalk 
in nipple covers and bathing suits 
made of floss. No thanks, I’ll pass.

I would hereby like to thank the 

Victoria’s Secret Angels for remind-
ing me that looks are what peo-
ple covet the most, and that your 
tanned and toned bodies (kudos to 
that California girl, Katy Perry) are 
what set the societal standard for 

beauty and sex symbolism. Thank 
you for reminding me that I, and 
99 percent of other girls like me, 
will never touch those standards. 
While you bronze your chests with 
self-tanner and wear push-up bras, 
I wrap my chest in thick scarves 
to inform the world that I’m more 
than just a body — the exact antith-
esis to the messaging which these 
fashion shows promote.

Maybe I’m just cynical, or 

maybe I’m just jealous. But what I 
do know is that I refuse to aspire 
to be like women who, with a little 
luck and a lot of starvation, suc-
ceed in superficiality. See, angels 
aren’t real, and I choose to watch 
real women do real things. Sorry if 
that’s a “bummer.”

— Detroit mayor Mike Duggan on Tuesday, in reference to the city currently 

bringing in higher revenues than estimated by the 2015 budget.

conservative in our revenue 

estimates, and make adjustments 
only when we’re absolutely certain 

the money is there.”

Why I can’t support 

“Fifty Shades of Grey” 

TO THE DAILY: 

I’m all for female writers. I’m all 

for exploring sexuality. I’m all for 
safe, consensual sex. I’m not all for 
“Fifty Shades of Grey.”

When I first started hearing 

about “Fifty Shades of Grey,” I 
didn’t pay much attention. Several 
of my close girlfriends had picked 
up the book as their first foray into 
erotica and would occasionally 
remark to one another about their 
enjoyment of the piece. They found 
the scenes sexy, the visuals steamy 
and even if the writing was subpar, 
at least they were finally getting a 
female-centric perspective of sex 
(something often lacking in male-
engineered porn and other erotic 
expressions).

I’m supportive of people tak-

ing control of their sexuality. I’m 

supportive of people reading and 
watching various types of material 
to determine their intimate prefer-
ences. I’m in no way shaming any 
sexual preference, fetish or the 
BDSM culture depicted in “Fifty 
Shades of Grey;” if that works for 
sexual partners, by all means, they 
have my blessing.

My problem with “Fifty Shades 

of Grey” is that it presents an abu-
sive relationship in a glamorized 
way. “Fifty Shades of Grey” is a 
disappointment in that it normal-
izes abuse and has joined a cultural 
trend of romanticizing behavior on 
the big screen that is dangerous in 
reality. Outside of their sexual rela-
tionship, Christian Grey attempts 
to control Anastasia Steele. He 
stalks Ana, wires her phone with-
out her knowledge, limits who 
she can talk to and when, controls 
what she eats, is prone to threat-
ening outbursts and frequently 
isolates Ana from other company. 

The problem with Grey and Steele’s 
relationship is that the dominating 
behavior continues outside of the 
bedroom; it’s manipulation dressed 
up in a sexy tuxedo. Christian Grey 
isn’t a sexual fantasy; he’s a preda-
tor you could find on any street.

Instead of spending money on 

the dissemination of this unhealthy 
relationship archetype, I urge you 
to find ways to give back to those 
most affected by the popularity 
of these movies: abused women. I 
donated the ticket price to “Safe 
Haven Shelter for Battered Women” 
online. Volunteering and speaking 
out against unhealthy relationship 
behaviors are other important ways 
to help change our unhealthy sex-
ual culture. We have the consumer 
purchasing power to change what 
we see in our media. Now is the 
time to use it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Change the schedule and 

Christian privilege 

TO THE DAILY: 

The Michigan Daily recently 

published an editorial in which it 
argued that, for the reason of reli-
gious accommodation, the Uni-
versity should avoid scheduling 
future fall terms to end as close to 
Christmas as the Fall 2015 term, 
which ends on Dec. 23. In so doing, 
the Daily uncritically and unjustly 
upholds the hegemony Christian-
ity exercises over the University’s 
schedule.

Our entire calendar is already 

designed to cater to Christian holi-
days. We will never have classes or 
exams on Christmas or Easter, and 
we have an entire break that is de 
facto designed to facilitate the cel-
ebration of the former. This level 
of accommodation is not avail-
able to other religious groups. For 
example, 
Hanukkah 
overlapped 

with final exams last term, and yet 
there were no widespread peti-
tions or editorials demanding that 
we reschedule the Fall 2014 term 
to avoid this conflict. Given the 
diversity of holidays celebrated by 

members of the University commu-
nity, there are undoubtedly many 
more holidays that regularly con-
flict with our academic calendar. 
The reason is simple: the Univer-
sity’s calendar, like most calendars 
in America, is planned around the 
Christian calendar, and other reli-
gious groups are given little, if any, 
consideration. Requesting religious 
accommodation 
for 
Christmas 

beyond that which is already grant-
ed is a blatant display of Christian 
privilege, and completely over-
looks the unequal consideration the 
University already gives towards 
Christianity in scheduling.

The Daily asserts that Pro-

vost Martha Pollack’s request to 
reschedule the end of Winter 2016 
classes by two days to accom-
modate 
Passover 
constitutes 
a 

“glaring inconsistenc[y]” in sched-
uling policy. However, this point 
is clearly unfounded: the proposed 
one-day gap between the begin-
ning of Passover and the end of 
classes in that policy is exactly 
equal to the one-day gap between 
the end of exams and Christmas 
already in place. Additionally, the 
proposed changes still had exami-

nations overlapping with some of 
Passover, whereas Christmas does 
not, and will never, overlap with 
finals. Finally, the Daily ignored 
that Pollack’s requests also sought 
to accommodate a Christian holi-
day: Greek Orthodox Easter. The 
Daily’s request to accommodate 
Christmas with an even larger gap 
than that which was requested for 
Passover therefore constitutes a 
“glaring inconsistency,” not Pol-
lack’s actions.

I am highly sensitive to the 

increased cost of travel around 
Christmas, and for this reason I 
do not disagree with the proposed 
changes. But to assert that the cel-
ebration of Christmas deserves 
increased religious accommoda-
tion when it already receives more 
accommodation than any other hol-
iday is both insensitive to the ways 
our University and nation privilege 
Christianity, and unfair to the non-
Christians whose religious calen-
dars receive nowhere near the same 
level of consideration automatically 
granted to Christians, if any at all.

Opinion
Wednesday, February 25, 2015 — 5A

T

he night of Tuesday, Feb. 
9, Deah Barakat, age 
23, his wife Yusor Abu-

Salha, age 21, 
and her sister, 
Razan 
Abu-

Salha, age 19, 
were 
killed 

execution-
style by Craig 
Stephen 
Hicks. 
Hicks 

was 
indicted 

in the triple 
homicide, 
allegedly over 
a parking dispute. However, 
many 
people, 
including 
the 

families of Deah, Yusor and 
Razan, believe that the shootings 
were a hate-crime due to the 
victims’ Muslim faith.

I will start by saying I do not 

claim that the actions of Hicks 
were due to him being an atheist 
or that somehow atheism is fun-
damentally violent or hateful. To 
do that would be stooping down 
to the level to those who claim 
that Islam is inherently violent, 
and I know what it feels like to be 
stereotyped and labeled based on 
the actions of someone else.

I would like you to step into my 

world as a Muslim-American in 
the aftermath of this event.

On Wednesday morning, I 

woke up to texts about how Deah, 
Yusor and Razan were killed 
from my friends and family who 
were upset and shocked at the 
heinous crime and lack of media 
coverage. I saw tweets and Face-
book posts by Muslims pressur-
ing the media to cover the story 
and read the media coverage 
that called the incident a sim-
ple “parking dispute.” Despite 
the shock, I dragged myself out 
of bed, put on my “Respect my 
Choice” T-shirt with a hijab logo 
on it, and walked out of my room 
with a brave face.

I would not let hate change me.
That night, the University’s 

Muslim Student Association held 
a candlelight vigil where people 
expressed their mourning, shock 
and frustration with the media 
coverage. There was support 
from people from all different 
faiths, proving to me that there 
were others who could under-
stand why this was so heart-
breaking. And while the media 
still debates whether Islamo-
phobia exists, I can tell you that 
at the vigil, a place where people 
should have their time to mourn, 
hagglers yelled slurs like, “Is that 
ISIS?” It added insult to injury; 
needless to say, I wasn’t com-
pletely surprised.

And then Thursday came, and 

it felt like a second blow. I could 
not focus on any of my classes, 
and yet it seemed like there 
weren’t many who understood 
why this hit me so hard. I could 
have sat out of class or explained 
why I didn’t finish my homework 
in time, but the fear that no one 
would understand overwhelmed 
me. Why I would feel so upset 
by an event that is only consid-
ered a hate-crime by those who 
choose to believe it is something 
I could not bear to explain, and 
so I stayed silent.

I spent the day scrolling 

through articles and pictures of 
the newly wedded couple and 
Razan, who was the same age 
as me. I thought of my broth-
ers, friends and family members, 
thinking about their similarities 
and the bright futures that had 
been lost.

Today, I look back at these 

events and tell you that all they 
have done is made me more aware 
of some crucial realities.

I thought long and hard about 

my own identity and my place in 
America, the country I was born 
and raised in. 
The 
media 

portrayal of 
these events 
claimed that 
this 
was 
a 

parking dis-
pute, 
and 

newscast-
ers 
spent 

their 
time 

interviewing 
Hicks’ 
wife 

instead of the family of the vic-
tims. I could not help but feel a 
lump in my throat. These were 
people that looked so similar to 
me, and yet there seemed to be 
little sympathy. Instead, another 
round of public debates.

As if something deep inside 

me had been uncovered, I 
thought to myself, “Where do I 
exist?” Am I the enemy in sight 
of the eyehole of the American 
sniper? Am I the woman hid-
den behind a veil of oppression? 
Maybe I’m one of those name-
less characters screaming in a 
foreign language in the back-
ground of an action scene.

Am I a suspected terrorist or a 

moderate Muslim who seems to 
be somewhere silently floating in 
the midst? If you could point me 
to one American television show 
or movie that has a portrayal of 
the happy Muslim neighbor, I 
would be more than happy to 
watch it. Is the media trying to 
ignore that an educated, practic-
ing, American Muslim can pos-
sibly be a part of society?

Am I to sit silently while the 

media tries to push me aside and 
make me feel like I just do not 
belong here?

Or maybe I will have hope that 

people will see these problems for 
what they really are: a product of 
misconceptions.

Regardless of whether or not 

you believe that this was a hate 
crime, there have been several 
after the shooting that paint a 
larger picture of hate-driven 
crimes against Muslims and 
Arab-Americans. On Monday, 
Feb. 16, a man in Houston was 
charged with arson in an Islam-
ic center and on Thursday, Feb. 
12 an Arab-American man was 
beaten at a Kroger in Dearborn. 
These are just a few of the recent 
hate crimes against Muslims, 
crimes that are five times more 
common now than they were 
before Sept. 11, 2001.

The idea that Islam is inher-

ently violent or anti-Western is 
one that incites hatred of Mus-
lims. The only way to combat 
these ideas is by combating the 
ignorance 
surrounding 
these 

claims. 
I’ve 

heard 
too 

many 
times 

about people 
that 
simply 

“aren’t sure” 
what Islam is 
really about. 
They 
take 

the words of 
people 
who 

pull excerpts 
of the Quran 

out of context or claim that some-
how the one person or even one 
government is representative of 
every Muslim. People must learn 
to separate Islam from terrorism 
if the hatred against innocent 
Muslims is to cease.

I could go on to say that the 

lesson I learned from the death 
of Deah, Yusor and Razan is 
that it’s solely Muslims who face 
these obstacles, but the great-
er reality is that we should be 
working toward a society with-
out hate on all levels. Islamo-
phobia isn’t just a problem for 
Muslims the same way that 
racism is not just a problem for 
Black Americans. It affects us 
all, and ignoring it as a prob-
lem only allows more and more 
people to be hurt. The only way 
to combat these hate crimes is to 
stand up against them regard-
less of the victim.

I will stand with you. Won’t 

you stand with me?

On Monday, the University 

Medical 
School 
Information 

Services rolled out its imple-
mentation of AirWatch, a mobile 
device 
management 
system 

being used to secure personal 
cell phones of employees and 
students. Numerous high-profile 
losses of protected health infor-
mation at other institutions — 
and the inevitable lawsuits that 
followed — were cited as pre-
cipitating factors leading to our 
health system’s adoption of the 
security software.

AirWatch aims to prevent sen-

sitive data from falling into the 
wrong hands by providing the 
ability to remotely wipe a device 
that has been lost or stolen, as 
well as the means to constantly 
monitor whether a device has 
been compromised. The software 
requires full administrator access 
to one’s phone to do so; permis-
sions granted to the AirWatch 
Agent application are broad, 
including the ability to determine 
the device’s precise location, 
directly call phone numbers and 
even take pictures and videos. 
MSIS maintains that our version 
of AirWatch “does not collect 
any data related to phone calls, 
texts, location or web browsing,” 
because “these capabilities have 
been disabled.”

Questions 
about 
AirWatch 

have been raised by medical stu-
dents, many of whom learned 
about the decision to support the 
software on a Friday, only three 
days before the platform’s offi-
cial Monday launch. Confusion 
regarding the scope of surveil-
lance, access to tracked infor-
mation and the possibility of 
uninstallation reigned, but one of 
the most commonly voiced con-
cerns was simply, “Do I need to 
install AirWatch?”

Announcements 
included 

phrases such as “deadline for 

enrolling” without pointing out 
that participation is strictly vol-
untary; users who do not install 
the monitoring package will still 
be able to access their UMHS 
e-mail accounts through their 
devices’ web browsers.

An important concept in medi-

cine is the right to an informed 
decision, one which can only be 
made after understanding all of 
the relevant facts about each of 
the options available, without 
being coerced or rushed. It isn’t 
necessary for the health care 
provider to agree with the deci-
sion, as each patient makes each 
choice within the context of his 
or her own value system; hence, 
there are no “right” or “wrong” 
options. Similarly, the crux of 
issues surrounding privacy and 
technology resides in supply-
ing the end user with enough 
information to weigh costs and 
benefits before arriving at an 
informed decision.

Patient data should be protect-

ed, but at what cost to the securi-
ty of employee and student data? 
The large number of medical stu-
dents who change their names on 
Facebook during the residency 
application cycle indicates that 
privacy remains a major concern 
— if we are so guarded about the 
information that we have chosen 
to share online, why would we 
not also wish to protect our pri-
vate texts and e-mails?

We live in a time when the 

nature 
of 
the 
relationship 

between 
citizens, 
companies 

and government over communi-
cations is in a state of constant 
flux; in the last few days alone, 
headlines 
have 
been 
awash 

with revelations that computer 
manufacturing 
giant 
Lenovo 

intentionally packaged a major 
security flaw into its new laptops, 
while ongoing revelations about 
the extent of NSA surveillance 

continue to astound in both vol-
ume and audacity.

As consumers and responsible 

citizens, we must take active 
steps to protect our privacy. This 
can be difficult in the mobile 
device domain, as the only way 
to truly ensure that one’s data is 
completely safe is to not own a 
cellular phone in the first place. 
Obviously for many people this 
is not a viable option, so every 
day we make tradeoffs, judging 
which risks we deem accept-
able. We may still choose to talk 
where we can be overheard, 
or text where our screens can 
be read over our shoulders or 
e-mail knowing the messages 
can be intercepted.

Some users will trust Air-

Watch, 
acknowledging 
the 

potential privacy compromises 
that it presents in favor of the 
convenience of accessing e-mail 
on their own devices. Others 
will opt not to install AirWatch, 
choosing instead to check their 
mail with their phones’ web 
browsers while relying upon 
their pagers to communicate 
urgent messages. A few may 
even decide to use entirely sep-
arate devices for personal and 
professional business.

There 
are 
no 
“right” 
or 

“wrong” options, as each choice 
is made in the context of the end 
user’s individual value system. 
Moving forward, it’s important 
that we focus on seeking student 
input about changes related to our 
school’s information technology 
policies, in addition to continuing 
to supply users with the informa-
tion necessary to make informed 
decisions regarding their privacy, 
without being coerced or rushed.

“Are we Simon and Garfunkel yet?” “I don’t know, do you have an afro yet?”
Tears for Fears is 
still revolutionary

30th anniversary 
of synth pioneers’ 

biggest album

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

Roland 
Orzabal 
and 
his 

classmate John Baker stroll 
through the streets of Bath, 
England. It’s 1978 and they’re 
both 16 years old. 

As they traverse the rich, 

antiquity-begotten city, they 
talk about that night’s show: a 
short half-hour gig at the local 
pub. The last time they played 
the venue they were nearly 
ridiculed off stage, as attend-
ees were quick to pounce on the 
youth and naivety of the “Baker 
Brothers” band. 

But tonight would be dif-

ferent, the two friends agreed. 
They would first find a new 
name for the band, and it had 
to be something simple, some-
thing American maybe. The 
group was, after all, descended 
from the new wave and the 
mod revival. New wave music 

was just starting to split from 
punk, and the Americans were 
taking an early charge. Orzabal 
and Baker thought for a while, 
and they eventually settled on 
something familiar: the movie 
“The Graduate.” They’d been 
opening with Simon and Gar-
funkel’s “Mrs. Robinson” pretty 
consistently, and it made sense 
to stick with something iconic. 

And so it was. The Baker 

Brothers became Graduate.

After releasing an album that 

achieved moderate success (it 
was a strange but catchy con-
tribution to early ska music), 
the group toured in Spain and 
Switzerland. They continued 
to negotiate with the new wave 
movement, but when electron-
ics came to prominence as 
viable means of music making 
around 1980, Graduate quickly 
dissolved.

Orzabal and Curt Smith were 

members of the camp that saw 
the emergent realm of syn-
thesizers and computers as an 
avenue for exploring human 
emotion. They were, in their 
earliest days, fascinated by the 
idea of primal therapy – a psy-

chological treatment developed 
in the 1970s by psychiatrist 
Arthur Janov.

Janov believed all painful 

experiences in childhood are 
shaped by long-term repression, 
and that much of the anxiety 
and neuroses we face as adults 
comes from this avoidance of 
trauma. As part of the doctrine 
of his larger primal therapy 
theory, he states that he and 
his colleagues “have found a 
way into those early emotional 
archives and have learned to 
have access to those memories, 
to dredge them up from the 
unconscious, allowing us to re-
experience them in the present, 
integrate them and no longer 
be driven by the unconscious. 
For the first time in the history 
of psychology, there is a way to 
access feelings, hidden away, in 
a safe way and thus to reduce 
human suffering.”

What’s most interesting, and 

what was also most relevant 
to Orzabal and Smith, is the 
notion that previous emotions 
can be summoned to the pres-
ent moment. In the present, 
they can be experienced and 

approached in an entirely dif-
ferent light. These ideas of emo-
tional access, self-address and 
re-learning childhood are what 
captivated Orzabal and Smith 
most while they were forming 
their new group. They believed 
that music had a responsibility 
to perform this kind of conjur-
ing, to draw out the personal 
and individual emotions of lis-
teners.

Similarly, it was the place of 

computers and modern tech-
nology to assist with music’s 
emotional summon. The devel-
oping electronic mode prom-
ised access to a range of human 
emotions not yet touched or, 
in light of primal therapy, 
not yet recalled. Orzabal and 
Smith resolved to pursue this 
infant frontier. They added Ian 
Stanley and Manny Elias to the 
group, as both were renowned 
for their work with program-
ming. 
The 
foursome 
called 

themselves Tears for Fears. 

With their debut album The 

Hurting, the group found three 
major hits in “Mad World,” 
“Change” and “Pale Shelter.” 
The true genius of the work, 
however, can be heard in Stan-
ley’s careful ventriloquizing of 
the keyboards through comput-
erization. In “Mad World,” he 
pushes the song’s tone toward 
an absurdist blend of the sinis-
ter with the frightened. It’s as 
though the speaker’s deep fear 
of madness in the world makes 
him simultaneously superior to 
it, outside of it or without it. 

Echoes of Stanley’s imagi-

native programming can be 
heard in the jadedness of “Pale 
Shelter” or the indecision of 
“Change.” He lifts their oth-
erwise synthetic overwhelm 
into a state of dark ethereality, 
one in which elements of post-
punk conjoin with new wave 
to create a sense of comfort-
able isolation in the listener. 
Listening to Tears for Fears’ 
early work with The Hurting is 
like floating alone through the 
night sky and feeling somehow 
cocooned by the clouds. Stan-
ley’s skillful programming and 
engineering efforts, combined 
with Orzabal’s flair for grandi-
ose songwriting, would set the 
framework for their next and 
greatest album: Songs from the 
Big Chair.

Thirty 
years 
after 
its 

release, Songs from the Big 
Chair remains one of the most 
beloved, 
iconic 
and 
unap-

proachable pop albums of the 

’80s. For every 50-something 
music collector concerned only 
with the album’s place in Pho-
nogram Records history, there’s 
a 
self-conscious 
15-year-old 

newly exposed to the pangs of 
love and the deep melancholy 
recoiled within the music. 

The album’s detractors con-

sistently note its artificiality 
and its residence in surface-lev-
el sound. The synthesizers are 
too prominent and the melodies 
are too exuberant to promote 
any kind of intellectual reso-
nance. Perhaps the lyrics are 
too flat, the melodies too broad, 
the themes too toned and cheap. 
It was halfway through the 
decade of decadence, many crit-
ics claimed. What’s one more 
MIDI-programmed 
album 

going to do for the new wave? 
Who would care?

The answer: teenagers. 1985 

was the year designated by 
the United Nations as “Inter-
national Youth Year” mostly 
as a marketing ploy, but also, 
as some would argue, because 
few things mattered more than 
getting the new ‘digital’ gen-
eration onboard. The Internet’s 
Domain Name System – its cen-
tralized operation as a direc-
tory – was instituted on Jan. 
1. For the first time, a patient 
with an artificial, computer-
ized heart lived long enough 
to leave the hospital. “Back to 
the Future” was released and 
became the highest grossing 
film of the year. Super Mario 
Bros. was introduced to the 
public, as was the newly minted 
Nintendo Entertainment Sys-
tem. Microsoft issued its inau-
gural version of Windows. This 
was, perhaps, the first year in 
which world leaders recognized 
that the emerging generation 
would not be like them; instead, 
they would be brought up in the 
age of computers.

And so, teenagers felt the 

music of Songs from the Big 
Chair not as any kind of inflat-
ed new wave pop hysteria, but 
as a vessel, a connector that 
mapped their own malaise and 
confusion onto the strange new 
world of electronics. The album 
captured the precise moment 
at which youth and technology 
shared, for the only time in his-
tory, the same uncertainty about 
the future. It brought together 
teenage girls who wanted to 
understand themselves in the 
eyes of teenage boys. It showed 
young men how to be sensitive 
without losing their sense of 
cool or self-confidence. Mostly, 
with its rich layers, synthetic 
intensity and timeless melo-
dy, Songs from the Big Chair 
reflected back to teenage listen-
ers what they were most afraid 
of seeing in themselves: fear of 
not living up to expectations, no 
matter how grand. 

This is why when, on the 

opening track “Shout,” Orzabal 
belts, “In violent times / You 
shouldn’t have to sell your soul 
/ In black and white,” it’s like 
a release. He’s talking about 
the career-induced existential 
crisis we all know we’re heir 
to as members of the digital 
age, but the one we all hope to 

avoid anyway. This is also why 
his calm statement “I’m talking 
to you” seems to hit with extra 
weight. It’s because the noise 
and the fury of the world that’s 
barking orders still can’t extin-
guish the light the music holds 
in front of us. Tears for Fears 
know as well as we do that this 
isn’t escapism. It’s not romanti-
cism. It’s revolution. 

The immortal “Head Over 

Heels” and “Everybody Wants 
to Rule the World” each boast 
similar 
sentiments. 
Under-

neath the wash of treble tones 
and obvious air of romance on 
“Head Over Heels,” Orzabal 
unleashes the wisdom of some-
one who understands youth 
but who realizes that he can-
not help them. He sings, “But 
traditions I can trace against 
the child in your face / Won’t 
escape my attention / You keep 
your distance with a system 
of touch.” In other words, the 
songs achieve in a smaller sense 
what the album achieves in a 
larger sense: a sort of comfort-
able isolation. 

Perhaps the most endur-

ing of the album’s great hits 
is “Everybody Wants to the 
Rule the World,” a so-’80s-it’s-
beyond-’80s song that, once 
again, 
professes 
melancholy 

beneath the array of ebullient 
beats and bars. Its prescience 
into 
the 
modern 
Internet-

infested world, with all its secu-
rity issues and cyber attacks, is 
tucked perfectly between witty 
observations and pop-anthem 
declarations. “Welcome to your 
life / There’s no turning back / 
Even while we sleep / We will 
find you,” Orzabal sings. These 
verses sound like they could 
have been written yesterday 
about any one of a dozen online 
privacy breaches and hacks, 
only he goes a step further and 
offers a way out of the watch: 
“There’s a room where the light 
won’t find you / Holding hands 
while the walls come tumbling 
down / When they do I’ll be 
right behind you.” The message 
here is simple, if not entirely 
understated. Tears for Fears 
believes in one defense against 
the inevitable overcrowding of 
the digital era: human emotion. 

Take this into account with 

the album’s inspiration, a 1976 
television film called “Sybil,” 
which is about a girl with 16 
different personalities. The girl 
feels as though she can know 
herself only when she’s sitting 
in the ‘big chair’ of the analyst. 
She feels safe there – from her 
mother, from other children and 
even herself. 

Songs from the Big Chair, like 

the analyst’s big chair, swallows 
listeners up. Its oversized, over-
stuffed songs, which are too com-
fortable for some but just right 
for others, tower over us and, by 
doing so, obstruct any sight of 
the horizon or the sky. This is 
the world in which we live, the 
album seems to say. It’s not a bad 
world, nor is it condemning or 
unwelcoming. It’s just big and 
full of expectation. These emo-
tions and feelings, though grand, 
tall and overstretched in some 
places, are ultimately true. And 
above all, they’re yours.

“Please don’t P.M.D.”
‘Repeat After Me’ 
refreshes old idea

Celebrities parody 
themselves on Ellen-
produced ABC show

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

ABC’s new half-hour comedy 

“Repeat After Me” premiered Feb-
ruary 17 and, despite its modest 
viewership, 
it 

proved to be a 
fresh take on a 
recycled 
idea. 

Ellen 
DeGe-

neres executive 
produces 
the 

show, and her 
mischievous 
mark is all over 
it. Like DeGe-
neres’s 
day-

time talk show 
“Ellen”’s hidden camera segment, 
“Repeat After Me” distinguishes 
itself as funny, not because we 
get to watch celebrities make fun 
of people or watch regular people 
make fun of other regular people, 
but because we get to watch celeb-
rities make fun of themselves.

Wendi McLendon-Covey (“The 

Goldbergs”) hosts “Repeat After 
Me,” dictating to celebrities via 
earpieces what to say to people 
who recognize them, but have no 
idea they are being filmed. In this 
episode, Scott Foley (“Scandal”) 
interviews a potential babysit-
ter for his kids. “My six-year-old 

smokes,” he says, impressing upon 
her how “terrible” his kids are. 
Sarah Hyland (“Modern Family”) 
meets a French tutor, and says part 
of the reason she wants to learn 
French is because she has a French 
lover, so she’s “got French kissing 
down.” Randy Jackson (“American 
Idol”) speaks to the people tinting 
the windows of his new truck, ask-
ing if they do houses too, because 
he has a “huge mansion with lots 
of windows” in which he likes to 
“walk around nakey.”

After each scene, the actors 

tell the people being pranked that 
they are on a hidden camera show 
and bring them out to see the live 
audience. At the end of the epi-
sode McLendon-Covey chooses 
her favorite moment of the night 
— which for this episode is Foley 
curled up in the fetal position and 
doing his best impression of a cry-
ing baby while the nonplussed 
nanny attempts to comfort him.

What gives “Repeat After Me” 

its energy isn’t so much the unpre-
dictable interactions themselves 
— though they are, for the most 
part, hilarious. It’s in watching 
talented actors make complete 
fools of themselves. They know 
how to maintain their momentum 
on camera, even in the moments 
when they are waiting for their 
next command, so the energy 
never lags. The actors of this 
episode complement each other 
particularly well; Foley says every-
thing he’s told to but can’t quite 
keep the mischief out his eyes, 

Hyland is completely straight-
faced throughout her whole ridic-
ulous scenario and Jackson can’t 
stop making the rookie mistake 
of laughing before delivering his 
lines.

Another aspect of the show 

reminiscent 
of 
DeGeneres’s 

own segment is that McLendon-
Covey’s jokes play on the fact 
that these are very recognizable 
celebrities interacting with regu-
lar people. Foley tells his poten-
tial babysitter that if she wants 
an autograph, they better get that 
out of the way first, and then he 
asks her if she ever worked with 
famous people before and if she 
has any good gossip. Hyland 
asks teasingly if her new teacher 
recognizes her from “Modern 
Family” and then brags with a 
cutesy laugh, “I’ve won a bunch 
of Emmys,” pointing proudly 
to the shelf behind her. Randy 
Jackson 
introduces 
himself 

quite simply as Randy Jackson 
“from television.” They all sub-
tly poke fun at the kind of things 
people expect celebrities would 
say, and it never comes across 
as mean-spirited or exploitative 
towards the people on the show. 
“Repeat After Me” may not be 
new, and it may be a while before 
McLendon-Covey reaches the 
skill level of DeGeneres when 
it comes to improvising, but at 
least it’s not plagued by petty 
problems that characterize the 
majority of reality programs on 
television now.

BIG MACHINE

The whitest Kardashian.
Haters gonna hate, 
but I still love Taylor

By CATHERINE BAKER

For The Daily

Let me be the first to tell you 

that I own every song Taylor 
Swift has ever released. There, 
I said it ... moving on now.

It’s 
December 
2007 
and 

much of my extended family 
has flown in from Minnesota 
to spend Christmas at my 
home in Michigan. I’m about 
to descend the stairs from my 
bedroom where I have carefully 
crafted my outfit — a jean skirt 
and pastel sweater — when my 
cousin Becca stops me. She 
informs me that I must listen 
to this new song her friend 
showed her.

I’m 11 years old and my life is 

about to be changed forever.

Ok, 
that 
may 
be 
a 
bit 

dramatic, but you get the point. 
As soon as I heard the opening 
violin on “Our Song,” I was sold. 
The combination of pop music 
with a slight country twang 
was right up my alley. Taylor 
has come a long way since that 
fateful day, and her songs have 
matured from what played after 

“Blue” by Crazy Frog at my 
junior high dances to anthems 
that have taken the entire world 
by storm.

For the past seven years, 

I’ve grown up alongside Taylor 
Swift, and despite all of the 
criticism 
she 
receives, 
she 

continues to remain a positive 
and growing force in the music 
industry. She’s evolved from 
a heartbroken girl singing in 
a prom dress on her bed to an 
empowered and shamelessly 
independent 
young 
woman. 

Yes, her dancing at awards 
shows is somewhat awkward 
and her cat pictures take up a 
large portion of her Instagram, 
but that’s what makes her 
human. 
Think 
about 
it 
— 

when is the last time you saw 
a celebrity baking cookies or 
sending Christmas gifts to her 
fans?

These pop idols and super-

stars are placed on such high 
pedestals that it’s hard to imag-
ine them walking their dogs 
or eating breakfast. (Seriously, 
does Beyoncé even have time to 
eat breakfast?) It’s refreshing to 
feel a connection to the elusive 
world that is populated by icons 
like Lady Gaga and Kanye West. 
Some of her new songs on 1989 
may be about Harry Styles, but 
no one was outraged when Sam 
Smith sang about his ex on “Stay 
With Me” or when Katy Perry 
wrote songs about her ex-hus-
band, Russell Brand. The double 
standard that surrounds Taylor 
is unfair and, frankly, overused. 
It’s not outrageous that she sings 

about actual experiences that 
happen to her in her actual life 
— it’s what everyone does. Even 
after embracing all the stereo-
types that surround her, she still 
receives disapproval.

My memories of Taylor Swift 

don’t include the times she 
receives mean tweets or when 
someone makes jokes about her 
abundance of ex-boyfriends. 
Her songs are reminders of the 
time I danced to “Our Song” 
at Christmas with my cousin, 
when I blasted “Long Live” 
while getting ready for my first 
homecoming dance or sang 
to “Shake It Off” in the car 
during my senior year of high 
school. While taking Buzzfeed 
quizzes, I still pick Taylor to 
be my celebrity best friend. My 
love for her has not diminished 
— 
it 
has 
simply 
matured, 

and I suspect that I’ll always 
squeal a little when I hear she 
is releasing a new album. An 
entire generation has grown 
up alongside Taylor Swift and 
I suspect she’s just getting 
started. So keep shaking it off, 
Taylor, and the haters are gonna 
hate, but I’m rooting for you.

Senior Arts Editor

The vacation is written into 

our middle-class contract. We 
enter the workforce to earn 
money to squirrel away, but 
with the redemptive belief that 
there will be an opportunity 
for escape. Originally a luxury 
only for the elite, by the mid-
19th 
century 

the 
vacation 

was 
tugged 

down 
a 
few 

class notches. 
Amid a grow-
ing 
religious 

and 
medical 

suspicion that 
perhaps 
our 

Puritan indus-
triousness was 
turning against us, the vacation 
gained a prescriptive urgency. 
The beach wasn’t a luxury – it 
was a necessity.

Tatjana Soli’s latest book, 

“The 
Last 
Good 
Paradise,” 

unfurls against this psycho-
social landscape. With elegant 
prose that can swell into poetic 
intervals or sharp commen-
tary, Soli presents a book that 
courses with flawed, colorful 
characters, lavish food descrip-
tions (courtesy of a chef protag-
onist) and political intrigue. But 
beneath its lovely veneer is a 
book that confronts the Ameri-
can urge to escape on the balmy, 
outermost beaches of Polynesia.

The novel centers on Ann, 

an 
unhappy, 
yet 
successful 

attorney. In the first pages, 

she watches a fire consume a 
Los Angeles home; the proofed 
glass of her office blocks out 
the sirens and 90-degree heat, 
effectively enveloping her in a 
reclusive, airless bubble. Ann 
is suspended in a state of pro-
longed emergency — her job and 
her marriage festering instead 
of 
blooming, 
leaving 
Ann 

“marooned and stationary” in 
her stale life.

Ann’s chef husband Richard 

is on the brink of opening his 
first restaurant (financed by 
Ann) and fraying around the 
edges, especially as he’s saddled 
with managing his unreliable, 
charismatic business partner, 
Javi. And beyond their financial 
strain, Ann’s own body is muti-
nying against a fertility treat-

ment, which promises to deliver 
a baby she’s not sure she wants.

But before the siren call of 

motherhood sounds too shrill, 
the novel unleashes a set of 
legal circumstances that finally 
sends the couple on the luxury 
vacation they’ve put off for 
years (and funded by a trail of 
maxed out credit cards). There’s 

some delicious irony in the 
vacation finally taken to escape 
the law, but their flight mostly 
highlights the prolonged state 
of emergency that didn’t elicit 
escape — the paralyzed life, 
which contributes to its paraly-
sis by spinning its wheels.

As it is, travel isn’t the 

solution so much as the fleeting 
answer: 
“In 
the 
old 
days, 

when California was the end 
of the line, before the forces 
of 
globalization, 
one 
could 

just 
keep 
flinging 
oneself 

farther 
and 
farther 
west, 

hopefully landing somewhere 
that fulfilled one’s dreams of 
happiness before one ended up 
back in the place one started.”

Once on the balmy outreaches 

of Polynesia’s furthest tropics, 
Soli continues to sow the text 
with germane seeds of satire: 
free of WiFi and cell reception, 
the resort basks in its gadget-
free minimalism — which is 
slapped with a steep price tag, 
of course. Respite from society 
requires a chunk of change.

Beyond incisive commentary, 

the technology-free mandate 
severs Richard and Ann from 
all but memories of their old 
partners and bosses, which 
is 
crucial 
in 
transforming 

the island into a crammed 
stage full of combative egos. 
Once 
isolated, 
relationships 

unravel and reknit: somewhat 
implausibly, Ann’s rock star 
crush 
is 
vacationing 
there, 

along with his tan and supple-
limbed girlfriend Wende who 
catches the eye of Richard.

Daily Book Review: ‘Last Good Paradise’

The protagonists’ dissolution 

into 
the 
narration 
allows 

other residents to move into 
the foreground with varying 
results. 
While 
Loren, 
the 

resort’s mercurial owner with 
a mysterious past, plays an 
unlikely 
yet 
intriguing 
love 

interest for Ann, the rockstar and 
his girlfriend remain shallow 
even amid attempts to give them 
depth. Joli tries to repurpose 
the stock characters of Rockstar 
Sex God and Groupie, which 
feel flimsy against the originally 
hewed figure of Ann.

As Soli notes, lawyer-turned-

escapee Ann’s inner material 
is rich for excavation: “Wild 
could be in the heart of the most 
buttoned-down, 
burned-out 

lawyer … Wild was refuting the 

scratchy, dry surface of things 
and digging into the rich, loamy 
depths.”

What elevates this from a 

lovely character study is Soli’s 
heed to the invisible backbone of 
the resort — the native workers 
and their complex relationship 
with 
imperialism. 
The 
final 

third of the book unbinds the 
hidden hierarchy that organizes 
the island through a series of 
escalating political acts. Unlike 
Gaugan’s paintings that enamor 
Ann, this detour is surreal 
without 
artificiality;

‘M’ opens spring camp

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Jim Harbaugh compared the 

first day of spring practice to 
some warped combination of 24 
hours that included New Year’s, 
Christmas Day, Thanksgiving, 
a birthday, a family reunion and 
the first day of school.

That day was Tuesday for 

Harbaugh, and based upon the 
level of excitement one could 
imagine in his fictional holiday, 
it should have been difficult to 
function. But then again, the 
Michigan football coach is the 
same person who, when he was 
the coach at Stanford, said that 
he doesn’t observe major holidays 
because he’s “a jackhammer.”

Based on his thoughts after 

the 
Wolverines’ 
first 
spring 

practice Tuesday, it seemed as 
though that was the case. He 
wore his trademark khakis and 
a Michigan hat styled similarly 
to the one previously worn 
by former Michigan coach Bo 
Schembechler. Cleats were his 
footwear of choice.

Nothing surprised Harbaugh 

about his first day of practice 
as the Wolverines’ coach, other 
than how quickly it went by. 
He enjoyed the day with his 
players — whether it was to the 
extent that a child would enjoy a 
birthday or Christmas is unclear.

“Time flies by when you’re 

having fun,” he said.

If Harbaugh learned much of 

anything about his team during 
that four-hour period, he tried to 
avoid saying it.

“We’re not really answering 

questions as much as we’re 
asking 
questions,” 
Harbaugh 

said. “What can we do? How 
can we get better? Where can 
we improve? Where can we get 
a mile an hour faster? Where can 
we get a percent better?”

The 
position 
of 
starting 

quarterback can be added to his 
question list. The team currently 

has seven quarterbacks on the 
spring practice roster. Junior 
Shane Morris, redshirt freshman 
Wilton Speight and early enrollee 
Alex 
Malzone 
are 
widely 

considered 
the 
frontrunners 

for the job, with highly touted 
recruit Zach Gentry expected to 
enter the mix during fall camp.

Harbaugh was noncommittal 

about putting a timetable on 
naming the winner of that battle.

“At some point, you’d like to 

think that that’s clear-cut and 
somebody earns that and it’s not 
close,” Harbaugh said. “That’s 
what we’ll be hoping for.”

Harbaugh said he’s keeping 

all seven quarterbacks involved 
in practice for now, giving them 
each opportunities. The role of 
coaching the quarterbacks will 
be a group effort, according to 
Harbaugh, and every offensive 
coach will be involved in some 
respect.

Harbaugh played quarterback 

at Michigan and in the NFL, but 

his trade position isn’t his only 
concern this spring.

During 
his 
brief 
tenure 

at 
Michigan, 
Harbaugh 
has 

insisted that all playing time 
will be earned, no matter the 
position, and that the positions 
themselves are up for grabs. The 
currently listed roster spots are 
of little matter, as much as fans 
might wonder about the position 
changes of redshirt sophomore 
Ross Douglas (from running 
back to cornerback) and redshirt 
freshman Brady Pallante (from 
defensive tackle to fullback).

“We 
don’t 
mandate 
what 

positions a player plays. Some 
guys are trying out at multiple 
positions, both sides of the ball,” 
Harbaugh said. “It’s too early to 
say what’s going to take place.”

Harbaugh claims his main 

focus this spring is ensuring that 
his team gets better every day.

“I know that sounds very 

simplistic, but it’s so simple it 
might work.”

Losses magnify defensive 
concerns for Wolverines

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

The 
Michigan 
hockey 

team has been a bewildering 
spectacle this season, boasting 
the nation’s top offense but 
a defense that hasn’t quite 
reached respectability.

There have been questions 

swirling as to why the Wolverines 
can’t buckle down in their own 
zone for consistent stretches. 
Even the coaching staff has 
shuffled 
defensive 
pairings 

and hopped on the goaltending 
carousel more than once.

But what if the nation’s top 

offense is feeding into the 
lackluster defensive effort? To 
Michigan coach Red Berenson, 
that has been the root of the 
recurring defensive concerns.

“No question,” he said. “You 

get overconfident. That’s all 
you’re thinking about is offense. 
Even if you’re not playing 
well, you start worrying about 
playing better with the puck.”

Saturday, Berenson called the 

team in for a meeting to watch 
film and to emphasize defensive 
details one day after suffering 
a 5-3 loss at Ohio State. The 
message was simple — be a 
better player without the puck.

“Sometimes when you’re a 

good player, all you do the whole 
game is you’re hoping to get the 
puck, and then you get it, and 
then you hope to get it (again),” 
Berenson said after the game. 
“During that hope time, we’ve 
been giving up too many scoring 
chances and too many goals.”

The potency that Michigan 

has enjoyed for much of this 
season has created a mindset 
that screams offense first and 
defense second. This perception 
goes against all Berenson stands 

for as a defensive guru.

In 
Saturday’s 
meeting, 

Berenson preached about being 
more aware in the defensive 
zone, and he encouraged his 
players to stop watching and 
waiting for the puck to come 
to their sticks. Instead, they 
needed to make a conscious 
effort to body up and help 
teammates tighten up their 
defensive-zone 
coverage. 

Offense can wait.

“We talked a lot about taking 

pride in defense, because Red 
hates getting scored on more 
than he likes scoring,” said 
junior forward Boo Nieves. 
“Getting scored on is one of 
his biggest pet peeves. If you 
get scored on, you might find 
yourself sitting on the bench.”

Man-on-man 
defense 
and 

being active in the defensive 
zone have been parts of the 
Wolverines’ game that have 
been lacking. At times, scoring 
nearly four goals each game can 
be enough to place defensive 
concerns on the back burner.

But this week, that back 

burner gets shut off. Michigan 
started 
Tuesday’s 
practice 

with consecutive drills that 
emphasized 
defensive-zone 

coverage. Another drill at the 
tail end of the session was 
designed to help players make 
quick decisions on transitioning 
between defense and offense at 
the snap of a finger.

“This week, and probably the 

past couple of weeks, we’ve been 
talking on detail, whether it’s 
our forecheck or our D-zone,” 
said sophomore forward Tyler 
Motte. “Whether you’re on the 
right side or the wrong side of 
the puck, at a certain time, you 
never know how a puck is going 
to bounce, but as long as you’re 

detailed and on the right side of 
the system, things should start 
going our way.”

All of that means that in 

Berenson’s mind, his players 
have too often jumped the gun 
offensively 
when 
the 
other 

team corrals the puck in a 50-50 
battle. These mistakes have 
sprung the opposition toward 
odd-man rushes that magnify 
the Wolverines’ defensive lapses.

“When in doubt,” Motte said, 

“have a defensive mindset, and 
know that the offense will come 
with that.”

From the forwards down 

to 
the 
defense, 
improving 

defensively 
is 
a 
collective 

effort. 
Saturday’s 
meeting 

put an emphasis on showing 
that defense should be the 
priority heading forward. If it 
isn’t, Michigan’s chances at an 
NCAA Tournament berth will 
continue to fade.

With such a discrepancy 

between 
its 
offensive 

capabilities and its defensive 
shortcomings, 
Berenson 

deemed it time to shift focus. 
Defense, and defense alone, has 
held the Wolverines back from 
consistency and excellence.

At times, the offense and 

defense mesh well, and in those 
moments 
Michigan 
seems 

poised to compete with any 
team in the country. Other 
times, like Friday’s game at 
Ohio State, there are moments 
that leave this team asking what 
it could have done differently.

Just three weeks and six 

games remain before the Big 
Ten Tournament, and there’s 
no time for questions. The 
Wolverines can only settle for 
answers, and it appears they’re 
finally starting to grasp onto 
some.

Michigan routs Purdue on Senior Night

Elmblad ties career 
high with 19 points 
as Wolverines wrap 
up home schedule

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Writer

If it was going to be Nicole 

Elmblad’s last regular-season 
game as a Wolverine at Crisler 
Center, it was going to be a 
memorable one for the senior 
forward.

A player 

known 
best 
for 

her hustle and tenacity, Elmblad 
did just fine on the stat sheet, 
finishing with 19 points and 
tying her career high. Most of 
her points came from open looks 
from the free-throw area.

Even 
with 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team up by 
almost 30 points for a majority 
of the second half, coach Kim 
Barnes Arico didn’t take any 
chances with her team, which 
has squandered four leads in 
February games.

This time was different, as 

the Wolverines started off the 
game with a 10-2 run and never 
looked 
back, 
thrashing 
the 

Boilermakers, 81-50.

And 
especially 
after 

Saturday’s 
heartbreaking 

91-88 double-overtime loss to 
Minnesota, 
the 
Wolverines 

bounced back convincingly, just 
like they have done for most of 
the season after a loss. Michigan 
is now 6-3 in games following a 
defeat.

“That was an incredibly tough 

loss,” 
Barnes 

Arico 
said. 

“We’ve had a 
bunch of them 
this year, but 
our practices 
the last two 
day have been 
so focused. We 
can’t 
worry 

about 
that 

game because 
it’s over, we 
just have to focus on the next 
one and be the next Michigan 
team we can be in the next 
game. They did that, and I think 
that really speaks volumes of 
their character.”

Elmblad 
and 
freshman 

guard Katelynn Flaherty led 
the 
Wolverines 
in 
scoring 

with 19 points each, while 
senior forward Cyesha Goree 
led the way on the glass with 
11 
rebounds. 
Junior 
guard 

Madison Ristovski also had 
her best offensive output of the 
season, scoring 15 points on 
70-percent shooting.

The 
Wolverines 
shot 
53 

percent as a team.

As potent as the Wolverine 

offense was, the defense was 
just as stout. Playing a 2-3 zone 

for much of 
the 
game, 

Michigan held 
Purdue to its 
third-lowest 
scoring 
half 

of the season, 
allowing just 
21 
points 

before 
the 

break.

“Purdue 

is 
definitely 

a 
strong 
post 
team 
with 

(forwards Whitney Bays and 
Liza Clemons) on the inside,” 
Elmblad 
said. 
“They 
have 

bigger guards, so we wanted 
to pack it in and make them hit 
shots from the outside.”

The Wolverines forced 20 

turnovers and held Bays — 
Purdue’s leading scorer and 
rebounder — to just eight points 
and a single rebound. Bays didn’t 
record a point in the second half.

“She’s a great player, and she’s 

done a really good job for them 
all year,” Elmblad said. “We 
wanted to make sure we locked 
in on her.”

With 
the 
win 
tonight, 

Michigan has clinched the No. 8 
seed in the Big Ten Tournament 
next week in Chicago and will 
play the No. 9 seed March 5.

The 
winner 
will 
play 

Maryland, which clinched the 
Big Ten title Saturday night and 
is ranked No. 5 nationally, in the 
next round.

Tonight was all about the 

seniors, and for the Wolverines 
to get a win is huge for three 
players that have done so much 
for the program.

But staying in the NCAA 

Tournament picture isn’t too 
shabby, either.

“Yes, it’s Senior Night, but at 

the end of the day, we still have 
a season to finish,” Goree said. 
“Our mentality tonight was to 
finish the season strong to put 
us in the best position possible 
for the postseason.”

Week of rest aids 
‘M’ down stretch

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan coach John Beilein 

couldn’t help but laugh after 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s 64-57 win over Ohio State 
on Sunday.

“Who would’ve thought, three 

years ago when I was recruiting 
him, that (junior guard Spike 
Albrecht) would play 40 minutes 
and a team as good defensively 
as Ohio State would be in a full 
denial on Spike?” Beilein said.

Albrecht’s humble origins as 

a late signee make his successes 
seem 
like 
fantasy. 
But 
as 

Albrecht can attest, the reality 
of his high volume of minutes 
has taken its toll.

The junior battled through 

a hip injury for the bulk of the 
season, and though he looks to be 
at full strength now, his time on 
the court is adding up.

And it’s not just Albrecht. 

Freshman 
guards 
Aubrey 

Dawkins 
and 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman and sophomore 
forward Zak Irvin have been 
forced to play huge minutes in the 
thick of Big Ten play.

So with almost a week off 

between Sunday’s win over the 
Buckeyes and Saturday’s game 
at Maryland, it’s a safe bet that 
the Wolverines (7-8 Big Ten, 
14-13 overall) will be using the 
time to rejuvenate themselves. 
If the Ohio State game was any 
indicator, that could mean good 
things for their offense.

Coming off four days rest 

since its loss to Michigan State 
last Tuesday, Michigan came 
out bursting with energy against 
Ohio State, opening up a 12-point 
lead in the first 10 minutes. That 
initial burst was crucial to the 
Wolverines’ victory, building a 
lead for them to protect and to 
withstand an impending rally in 
the second half.

In the first half against the 

Buckeyes, 
Michigan 
looked 

the best it has since long before 
junior guard Caris LeVert went 
down with a broken left foot. And 

while part of the gained energy 
can be attributed to the growth 
and cohesion the newest unit has 
shown, the other part is as simple 
as getting more rest.

“Some guys have had selected 

rest, the guys that we felt need 
it, the Spike Albrechts and Zak 
Irvins, that are really playing a lot 
of minutes,” Beilein said Saturday. 
“Probably it’s a little bit of a shock 
to the bodies of Aubrey and 
Muhammad as well.”

Michigan’s 
schedule 
hasn’t 

done it any favors. The Wolverines 
have played two games every week 
since conference play opened, and 
their rigorous schedule has only 
been compounded by LeVert and 
sophomore guard Derrick Walton 
Jr.’s injuries.

With those two out, Abdur-

Rahkman has played over 30 
minutes in each of Michigan’s last 
seven games, and Dawkins hasn’t 
played fewer than 24 since Jan. 17. 
But as problematic as LeVert and 
Walton’s absence in practice has 
been, it has forced the freshmen 
to play nearly every minute of 
scrimmages.

That’s where extended rest 

comes into play. Without the 
urgency of learning an opponent’s 
system in limited time, Beilein 
is able to isolate players and give 
them rest as he sees fit.

And when he does rest players 

like Albrecht and Irvin, it leaves 
more 
room 
for 
one-on-one 

interaction with coaches.

“The guys that aren’t playing 

a lot of minutes are getting a lot 
of good individual instruction,” 
Beilein said Saturday.

Still, Michigan will have to 

guard against rust, making sure 
its longest break of the season 
doesn’t leave it struggling to catch 
up. Maryland will be coming 
off an emotional win over No. 
5 Wisconsin on Tuesday, so the 
Wolverines shouldn’t expect an 
opponent as lulled as Ohio State 
looked at tip-off.

But if Michigan’s long week of 

rest shifts it to a newfound gear, it 
could be huge for a team desperate 
for resume-building wins.

T

he ratemyprofessors.com evaluation 
said that [name removed] could turn 
a phrase, and they were right. The 

thing about [name removed] that I found out 
on my own, was that his ego sometimes gets 
in the way of the point — the point of the dis-
cussion, the reading, the class, educating the 
youth, good taste, imparting wisdom, etc., 
etc. Sometimes, there was no point. Some-
times, you could see him peering down at the 
point as if from very far away, waiting for it to 
catch up with him. I mean to say, that he was 
good at his job, but in a way that made want to 
bite your own teeth off. (Imagine). Obscure, 
unhelpful, and smarter-than-you. And this 
was the most consistent vibe in the room, I 
found. For a semester, it teetered between 
“this is fun and interesting” and “this is sort 
of offensive, so now we are going to wait it 
out.” The class, I mean. As a whole. The His-
tory of Art. It should be so simple. Jesus. 

I guess, put in a different way, my biggest 

frustration with this class (although it was 
usually interesting and well-presented) was 
that there was a certain need to answer the 
question in [name removed]’s own personal 
way, or maybe the way that [name removed] 
found personally meaningful. Oftentimes, it 
seemed like we were being tested for under-
standing [name removed]’s last impression of 
the readings. The real question is, how well 
do you know [name removed]? 

For example, I was the guy who was curi-

ous about the social reception of Hume’s 
aesthetics (i.e. “can the ‘goodness’ of ‘good 
art’ be measured by how it would actually 
be received?”), but I was sort of written off 
or filtered out because it was construed that 
I wanted to take some kind of trans-histor-
ical “survey” or whatever, and that “sur-
veys” weren’t going to help us understand art 
through the ages, and that is not what I was 
saying with a snide lilt, (which is also impos-
sible since so many of its would-be partici-
pants are dead), but rather must have been 

based entirely [name removed]’s terrible 
experience with “surveys,” since he seemed 
so premeditated-ly averse to this concept. At 
other times, I was filtered out because what 
I was saying didn’t match a given author, 
like X: “What X is saying,” [name removed] 
would say, “is that you are basically wrong, 
and I have no interest in the point you’re 
making divorced of the internal world I have 
constructed so that we can all like the same 
things because I like them and I have good 
taste, thanks for sharing.” Emphasis on the 
“X.” 

Maybe another example is that I’m writing 

this final paper on Ogilvy’s ideas about fiction 
and emotions (assigned by [name removed]), 
but I’m only quoting him where he’s relevant 
to a.) Poulet on the phenomenology of read-
ing, b.) Henry James, and also, c.) it must be 
said, the blank, staring obvious. Although 
we’ve been led to believe that [name removed] 
knew Ogilvy and got tenure by disproving 
some of his ideas, it doesn’t seem like a very 
good last word on the subject. Rather, and 
again, it seems like something that was per-
sonally meaningful to the professor, whose 
name has been removed. 

Of course, I’m not trying to be a dick, but 

hey, maybe it will help with “the quality of 
instruction in this course,” which despite the 
tenure thing, appears to be something that 
[name removed] – who I feel so privileged to 
address in the third person, as if he were a 
person you and I had just met (it is you actu-
ally reading this [name removed], isn’t it? Hi!) 
– “takes seriously,” and “values,” and what a 
great start we’re off to already! We are, actu-
ally, (I think). We are probably even past the 
start, and into somewhere in the middle, 
where the end is the ultimate, unreachable 
Form of this class as taught by a manifest god, 
or something even less interesting. 

In sum: 8/10. I basically liked this class.

The ship went down with its captain

as all sturdy sea ships do.

It sank in a flash

of briny salt splash

as the captain gazed over his crew.

The ship she sank to the bottom

as the captain turned sweetly mad.

And the crew they all shrieked 

as the cruel waves peaked

and the sea took back what it had.

Then all was lulled to some peace

as the crew walked tiredly ashore.

They all looked around

but no captain they found

whose ship lay on the sea floor.

Now all who remember dear captain

honor with venerable grace.

There was sea in his eyes

with strong waves as the prize

of his salty, sweet resting place.

When the men hoot and holler

It’s not because you’ve done something.

Flowers do nothing to be picked 

Except be there and beautiful.

Grow where you will

And bury your roots deep

Like a spiked weed.

Don’t wish you looked like one.

It’s not because you’ve done something.

Living shouldn’t be this hard.

A bitter bunch of pennies sit on the back of my tongue,

Each time your fist makes love to my eye.

We always begin with a dance of words.

The battered goat in the basement of our love

Limps into light,

All matted fur and tattered ears.

You create the creatures in the corner 

That crawl up my spine.

I force you to feel like you are falling from the 35th floor.

Nightmares and fears:

Weapons best wielded by the ones we trust most.

Our words have weight behind them,

Then we put our weight behind them.

Strange flowers, the prints of knuckle on flesh.

Strange paint.

A math teacher once told me that

Architects are considered geniuses

for close following of a form to it’s function

That when the form of an object is suited perfectly to its 

function,

We are left with inherent beauty.

And it’s got me wondering

If the number of hearts I break

Exceeds the number of times I trip over my own feet

Does that deem my form

My architecture,

Inherently beautiful?

If I conduct my body like a well oiled machine

With grace and maximized efficiency,

Am I the product of some architectural genius?

Because if my form followed function

I’d have hips just wide enough for you to paint on

And above that,

A sliced piece of cedar bark

Cascading curls would serve their purpose

Of driving lovers to dizzying insanity.

I’m no mathematician nor a masterpiece

But they say that when your form follows its function

With empty spaces to be filled

And smooth surfaces to run fingertips across

All things reflective and light

You’ll have beauty like bridges unbroken

And towers tall and thin.

Johnny knew of the angry nights in pool rooms, when his father whirled like an eight ball spinning 

above the socket. A shiver of movement, and the game was over. He saw the muscles rippling as the 

man rustled his morning paper, the flash of gritted teeth as he pushed the lawn mower through the 

sticky pit of summer. His strength was his skin, worn into like the habit of flinching at a firing gun. 

The same thick blood raced through his son. While the house quivered under his father’s footsteps, 

Johnny would run. Dashing in the dewy mornings, guided by starlight and his own breath, around 

wispy fields and sunken sidewalks and unmarked rivers, their names scrubbed off of maps. He would 

sit at a school desk, sneakers tied, legs wiggling too much to concentrate on combustion reactions. 

Boom. At the bell, he was a hamster in a wheel, treading on rubber until the coach told him, 

Go home, Johnny Boy. Desire bubbled from his tremendous lungs at supper, burning a hole 

through the tablecloth, deep in the wood. He would walk dutifully to bed, only to slip 

out of his sheets — a blurred bandit. The day of the race came. Johnny broke the 

news like eggs over breakfast with his father. I’m busy today, Son the 

man said. And that day, outside, the defeated man pushed

the lawn mower over the dying grass. It was his third 

week without work. He was listening. The 

chorus of voices rose up, over the 

bushes, through the thick, wet air.

A roar.

W

e’ve been together for years. 
You are, in a way, just a sofa, 
and I am mostly a raven, a door-

knob, a lunatic. I don’t seek vindication for 
this, I know I just am, and you, for this long 
moment, are. In terms of accessibility, you’ve 
always been the best, and courted many and 
offered your services freely to a whimsical 
republic, those people who enter and exit 
and spend much shorter moments around 
us, and sometimes they grope me, but seem-
ingly more often you, them; you offer me no 
protection apart from some small aspect of 
distraction, and you do not look disgustedly 
on me when man-handled but remain illus-
trious in your position, watching; for your 
attention is everywhere, and though I swing 
and revolve and am maneuvered, any move-
ment by you would catch all the attention 
of those fragment-moment-minded maneu-
verers in this room—they do not realize the 
piece is in your handle of your long-sitting, 
your lack of deformity over time, your 
patience; what I mean to say is I think you’re 
not well-enough-appreciated.

And the space between us rattles and 

grows, and I’ve squeaked and been lubricat-
ed and you’ve only just begun. And the space 
between us reduces and could shimmer, or 
maybe I only imagine so. Your light yellow-
stained satin body glows like soft lightning; 
your parallel body is a forced symmetry that 
affords itself with the realization that a mask 
is a blink—a realization I remember hap-
pening, that knocked me off my seat, post-
alighting at the window-sill, and took away 
all my anger from you. Who has the right to 
show such perfection? There is no balance of 

this sort in nature. Perhaps during the basic 
explosion there was some. Why should there 
be here, was my question? I admit I felt some 
sort of godly perfection when I came from 
the inner-gilded, though outwardly brown 
furnace. Or was this the whimsy of inexpe-
rience? For though I’ve flown from there to 
there daily a-time, I’ve only done so. But I’ve 
never forgotten. I’ve never even fallen asleep 
in surgery.

The realization that the mask is tempo-

rary, and truth will never be found, but may 
happen in experience at moments of divine 
insight, like crashing, orgasm, or at the edge 
of sleep. When we don’t know what is hap-
pening but might. That the divinity within 
you truly may be found greatly within your 
constituents at the end when all is so un-
pressured that the split re-happens again 
in totality. Everything is allowed to break 
apart; and if anything were ever anything or 
even imagined, it can and must be real there 
in the recombination of all parts and motives 
that become the great thing—including us, 
including us two together, for the briefest 
of any moment, when light and void become 
irrelative, and inseparable. No longer two 
sides of a page, they are the flame that burns 
it, dynamic, an end of god and balance, a cho-
ral glissando at the end of time. Until then, 
we masquerade, and it could be that nobody 
notices.

Though I’ve seen you every second since 

I came to be in this room. Can I say it? That 
I’m jealous of the asses of those humans 
who bleat around rubbing appendages 
on things, who rub things and each other 
down, (sometimes on you!) and move and 

run their mouths off with their bleating, 
who sometimes spill. I hate them. I’m jeal-
ous of their asses. Had they the respect for 
you they should they would lick (lick!) you, 
though I’m glad that they never did. I want 
to be set atop you. I want to roll underneath. 
I am promised physical exasperation, I have 
always been potential, pent up, with a spring 
down my back and wings that won’t stop to 
flutter and won’t pretend to until unstopped 
universal flight. Were it a fool who wished 
he were an ass? I am both; also a raven and 
a doorknob.

Also I am here on this side-table, for they 

took me down when they left, placed my 
body here so close to yours, inches, even, 
from touching for the first time. And we have 
been this way for years, though you’ve been 
unkindly tarpaulin’d and I collect dust with 
my skirts in the air open; and I lay as if crest-
fallen, prostrate, crucified, wings and beak 
agape. And I am crestfallen; the room has 
not been lit for some time. The last—when I 
was moved—I was taken down with screws 
and carried in a man’s back pocket. The door 
hasn’t closed since. He travelled in the room, 
adjusting and removing the final things, 
blanketing the chairs, the table, and then 
he came to you, and sighed. He turned to 
sit and lowered himself, me first, so close to 
you I could feel something that just buzzed 
between us, a sign of electricity that I’m sure 
would have killed the man upon collision, 
something that pushed away all dust and left 
just the you and the me in the glob of cre-
ation of the first dawn, the planar spread of 
pulsing final, we two segments on a line and 
me alone and you alone in me and just this 

man who nobody could recognize, bring-
ing we two finally to we! And he whispering 
“Lenore” and watching me. He removed me 
from his pocket, placing me open chested on 
the small table near you, mouth gasping in 
horror, distance from you horrible. And then 
he sat on you. And then he covered you up.

It is believed that nothing can ever be 

touched. Just, it’s your electrons bounc-
ing against other electrons, or magnetized 
against each other or something, and the 
atoms in your fingers never touch the atoms 
in another’s fingers, like a doorknob can 
never touch a couch, even were they to ever 
be finally against one another. Your fingers 
can never touch a pencil, or a keyboard. Simi-
lar to how a voice can never speak a thought 
except for using a language, how there could 
be no perfect communication but touch, were 
touch true, except in memory, the expand-
ing original, or the end that breaks. How the 
words are broken thought, learned or given, 
accepted because what are you ever without 
them, and it’s beautiful, and it’s like some 
sort of technological beast designed and who 
walks you, and loses pieces in walking, and 
how every moment you are creating in your 
choice to even move or not, operating in the 
realm of imitation and novelty, everything as 
possible as any other thing, where imagina-
tion is revealed to be just belief in everything 
as it’s all true, like the love between a door 
handle and a couch. All necessarily plausible, 
because what can you ever sense that never 
existed, and what whatnot extant.

It’s bad, and like I’m laying similar to open 

near but never to touch you and horrible, or 
normal.

THE GREAT SUMMER 

BLACKOUT OF 2003

ILLUSTRATIONS BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND

DESTINY’S 

CHILD

I 

saw her first through the fog that engulfed 
the courthouse in one swift embrace. I 
wondered if she would recognize me, 

even though I knew she wouldn’t. My car’s 
headlights were my shield, just as her teardrop 
eyes were safetly locked, protecting her from 
the truth. I guess I wouldn’t want to know me 
either, all things considered. 

Her hands were small and strong. She was 

hunched over, as though she was carrying an 
enormous load upon her back. I suppose, in a 
way, she was. My eye focused on the wrinkle 
carved over her left eyebrow. I couldn’t help 
but think that I had put that age-mark there 
by accident, like a sculptor whose hand slips 
and leaves a line that was never meant to exist. 
Her brow trembled. Don’t cry now, I encour-
aged silently from the warmth of my sedan. I 
can’t handle crying. Not now. She pushed an 
empty stroller, the ghost of her child playing 
peekaboo under its hood. The stroller was 
red, pierced with yellow stars and tagged with 
rainbows here and there. The woman didn’t 
seem to know the where of her destination. 
She didn’t seem to have a choice in the mat-
ter. She was pulled by necessity, by the tug 
of guilt that she was the one still alive. If she 
stopped, she’d think and remember the hole I 
had ripped in her family tree. Her footprints 
dug deeper in the tread of yesterday’s walk-
to-forget. Smudges of dirt flicked up on to the 
backs of her legs. 

I circled around the block, so she wouldn’t 

think I was following her. “There’s a parking 
spot,” you pointed out. But I ignored you and 
drove past the meter. I needed to see her one 
last time before it was my time to serve. In a 
moment of guilt-ridden masochism, I needed 
to see the mother’s tar-streaked tears, stain-
ing her lily-blossom cheeks. The little girl’s 
rattling laughter pounded in my head, stron-
ger than it had the night that I silenced her. 

We had parked outside of a quaint little 

house on a dark and quiet street. “Lovelock 
Court. That sounds like a nice one,” you said. 
While you and I had been dancing swirly tan-
goes on each other’s skin, car leather sticking 
to our necks, she was stocking up on taffeta 
make-believe and glass-slippered innocence. 
Coming out of our dizzy haze, I blindly flexed 

the pedal, and made contact with the runaway 
princess, whose frog prince waited in front of 
the car. She was a fly on my windshield, not 
making a dent as she collapsed on the road. 

And yet, I’ve never felt more weighed down. 
When had the world around me become so 

polarized? I had grown accustomed to the in-
betweens of this half-caff, capri length world. 
Suddenly, decisions needed to be made. Either 
we do or we don’t. We are or we aren’t. We live 
or we die. Yet, what was a life in prison but 
the slowest death known to man. The mother 
understood this much, I knew. She died a bit 
every day without her babe, while her tread-
marked memory lived on in her head. 

Would you visit me? I wondered. We had 

always said, that when the time was right, our 
child was going to be beautiful. Nights staring 
up at the ceiling imagining the chestnut hair, 
the brown eyes with my long slender nose and 
a bit of your freckles across the cheeks. She 
would have been a flautist. He would have 
been a doctor (a radiologist because he would 
get squeamish at the sight of blood). But our 
dreams were cracked like the pavement the 
mother walks on, day after day. It’s hard to 
fuck between metal bars, I wanted to say even 
though I hate swearing in front of you. I knew 
you would only understand if I was explicit.

But, she, the mother, and I, we were more 

alike than she would ever know. Both shack-
led in an endless reverie of the path not taken. 
You squeezed my hand and returned me to 
the present. “It wasn’t your fault. You know 
that.” I looked once at the court’s four Grecian 
columns, looming ahead. My vision blurred 
and combined them into one fat cement wall, 
blocking my view. I turned to see my victim’s 
victimized mother, taking the lonely path she 
never saw coming. “But I blindsided her,” I 
said. “I didn’t give her the chance to choose 
a different way.” It’s not your fault, I thought, 
hoping that in some magical way, my thoughts 
could transmit through glass windows and 
highly polluted urban smog. She was looking 
for her prince. You can’t stop a love like that. I 
took the key out of the ignition, wiped a black 
fleck of mascara from the corner of my eye, 
and prepared my retreat into destiny’s cold, 
metal womb.
