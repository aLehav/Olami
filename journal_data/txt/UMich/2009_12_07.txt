New student group
led primarily by
officials from MSA
By MALLORY JONES
Daily StaffReporter
After the Central Student Judi-
ciary ruled the Michigan Stu-

dent Assembly-led Constitutional
Convention unconstitutional, the
leaders of the former convention
and 20 of its members formed
a student group to continue the
convention's efforts to amend the
campus-wide constitution.
On Sept. 29, MSA created the
Constitutional Convention in
hopes of amending the student
constitution, but CSJ ruled on

Nov. 23 that the convention's
participants were not properly
elected.
Students interested in the origi-
nal convention submitted applica-
tions to MSA President Abhishek
Mahanti, who then selected about
40 applicants and presented their
names to the assembly for approv-
al. CSJ ruled that this process
did not constitute an election as

required by the constitution and
ordered the Constitutional Con-
vention be disbanded.
Immediately after the trial,
members of the former convention
mobilized to create the student
group Students for Progressive
Governance to continue the effort
to revise the constitution.

Big Ten schools push to curb
drinking at football games

TELLING SECRETS

'U' officials: There's
no plan to bring
similar program to
the Big House
By GRACELIN BASKARAN
Daily StaffReporter
In an effort to cut down on
excessive drinking before foot-
ball games, two Big Ten schools
are implementing probationary

programs for students who are
ejected from games because of
drunkenness.
But the University of Michigan
doesn't plan to implement a simi-
lar program any time soon.
The Show and Blow program at
theUniversityofWisconsin allows
students who have been ejected
from a game due to excessive
drinking to attend future games if
they take a breathalyzer test prior
to kickoff. The University of Min-
nesota began a similar program
this year called Check BAC.

Mary Jo Desprez, alcohol and
other drug policy and prevention
administrator, said University
of Michigan officials don't have
any plans to implement a similar
program, adding that managing
incidents of excessive alcohol con-
sumption can be difficult given
the number of other activities and
demands at football games.
"Alcohol issues, especially on
a Football Saturday, can really be
a tremendous issue to manage,"
Desprez said. "I think it's even

Atnleast two Virginia Tech University

of the cwo residence hail shootings in
April 2007 before announcing ic no the

reported.
These officials, who accordingcto the
Times "could have saved lives bynotify-

Hofstra University dropped its foot-

COPENHAGEN
* UN climate science
head hopes for more
action from the US
By executive action, the Obama
administration can boost the U.S.
target for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions beyond levels envi-
sioned in legislation working its
way through Congress, the head of
the U.N. climate science network
said yesterday.
"There is scope for going above
what is going to be legislated,"
Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of
the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, told The Associ-
ated Press on the eve of the U.N.
climate conference in Copenha-
gen.
Senate and House bills capping
carbon dioxide emissions would
reduce them by 17 to 20 percent by
2020, compared with 2005 levels.
Compared with 1990 levels, the
standard U.N. benchmark, that's
only a 3-4 percent reduction,
experts calculate, a contribution
far short of what scientists say is
needed among industrial coun-
tries to avoid dangerous climate
change.
WASHINGTON
White House still
lacks solid intel on
Osama bin Laden
Osama bin Laden may be slip-
ping back and forth from Paki-
stan to Afghanistan. Or the U.S.
might not have a clue, more than
eight years after the al-Qaida
leader masterminded the terrorist
attacks on America.
Given a chance yesterday to
clear away some of the mystery
surrounding the whereabouts of
the world's most wanted terror-
ist, Obama administration offi-
cials seemed to add to it with what
appeared to be conflicting assess-
ments.
President Barack Obama's
national security adviser, James
Jones, said bin Laden, believed
hiding mainly in a rugged area of
western Pakistan, may be periodi-
cally slipping back into Afghani-
stan. But Obama's Pentagon chief,
Robert Gates, said the U.S. has
lacked good intelligence on bin
Laden for a long time - "I think it
has been years" - and did not con-
firm that he'dsiped into Afghan-
istan.
DETROIT
Report suggests that
Michigan target
pensions for taxes
A national study questions
whether financially strapped
Michigan should continue its gen-
erous tax exemptions for retirees
on pensions.
If retired public employees,
those on private pensions and with-
drawals from IRAS and similar
retirement plans that are currently
exempt were taxed, the state could
collect as much as $700 million

more a year according to figures
from the state treasury, the Detroit
Free Press reported yesterday.
A recent study by the Pew Cen-
ter on the States questioned the
wisdom of those exemptions. The
study ranked Michigan among the
10 most financially troubled states
and said it has a growing elder-ly
population that requires more state
services but contributes little rev-
enue.
BRIDGMAN; Mich.
* Marshals use
website to track
Mich. sex offender
Authorities used a social net-
working Web site to track a man
wanted for failing to register as a
sex offender in Michigan.
The Herald-Palladium reports
that authorities in Topeka, Kan.,
have arrested Tommy Lee Col-
burn, formerly of Benton Harbor,
Mich. He was awaiting extradition
Sunday in the Shawnee. County
Jail. Jail officers had no record of
an attorney for Colburn.
Michigan state police say U.S.
marshals tracked 30-year-old Col-
burn's movements through a social
networking Web site.
Berrien County authorities
issued a warrant for his arrest
in 2006 for alleged violations of
the Sex Offender Registry Act.
Colburn had been convicted of
criminal sexual conduct involv-
ing a child.

MSA ELECTIONS
From Page 1A
day, MSA's Election Board met to
certify results and notify candidates
of their positions. But because of
the delay in confirming schools,
the positions of write-in candidates
could not yet be certified.
Students whose names appear
on the ballot must apply and have
their information checked before
the election. However, because
write-in candidates don't have to
apply to the Election Board before-
hand, the schools they are enrolled
in aren't verified until after the
election is over.
According to MSA President
Abhishek Mahanti, the Office of the
Register would not release the data
CONSTITUTION
From Page 1A
a student-wide ballot one of three
ways: by a duly created constitu-
tional convention, a two-thirds
majority vote by MSA, or by an
individual student or student
group with 1,000 student signa-
tures in support of the changes.
About 20 members of the for-
mer Constitutional Convention
have expressed interest in the
student group, according to MSA
Vice President Mike Rorro, for-
mer chair of the convention.
MSA Student General Coun-
sel Jim Brusstar, former conven-
tion secretary, and MSA Rules
and Elections Committee Chair
Michael Benson, former conven-
tionvice chair,willalsobeinvolved
in the new student group.
Rorro said that although many
of the student group members are
former convention members, and
the group retains the same lead-
ership, this student group is dis-
tinctly different.
"It's not the same thing, even
though there are some of the same
people involved in it, we recog-
nize that, we're not trying to hide
that," Rorro said. "We're not try-
ing to seclude ourselves within
the same group of people and con-
tinue work by limiting people."
Former MSA Rep. Tim Hull dis-
agrees. Hull said the involvement
of MSA executive board members
in the student group makes it hard
to believe the group is really sepa-
rate from MSA.
"MSA execs are participating
in it and I feel, (though) that might
be permissible under the Consti-
tution, the circumstances behind
the formation of this group make
it hard to confer legitimacy," Hull
said.

to Susan Wilson, director of Office
of Student Activities and Leadership,
who has been filling in for Awai-Wil-
liams, even though Awai-Williams
technicallyreports to Wilson.
"(Wilson) has been tryingto get
the data in a pretty timely fashion,
but for some reason they have not
been able to get us the data," Mah-
anti said.
Despite the confusion, Mahanti
said the Registrar's Office has been
helpful with trying to get the elec-
tion results certified.
Mahanti said he believes MSA
will be able to get the names veri-
fied today. However, the MSA
Compiled Code requires the Steer-
ing Committee to hear official
election results before the candi-
dates can be sworn in.
The committee, which meets
Rorro -said the group acknowl-
edges that there are members who
also serve on MSA, but since the
attempt to amend the constitution
through a body connected to MSA
failed, forming a student group is
the best option.
"We ran for student govern-
ment to fix things and to make
it a better University and unfor-
tunately we couldn't do that
through the MSA's procedure,
because it's not well-defined
and it continues to not be well-
defined," Rorro said.
According to the group leaders,
one of the goals of the revisions
will be to clarify the procedures
within the constitution that the
convention violated.
"We attempted to work within
the process and were unable to,"
Benson said. "One of the reasons
we're trying to change this docu-
ment is to make it so things are
easier, (so) it's clear."
To become a member of the
student group, a student must be
nominated by a current member
and then garner a majority vote of
the group. Rorro said this process
makes it much easier to join the
group than it was to be a part of
the convention.
Rorro said that because the stu-
dent group will need 1,000 signa-
tures before the document goes
up for a student-wide vote, the
process is valid, even with MSA
members in the sudent group.
"It's not an undemocratic pro-
cess," Rorro said, "because it
might be a small group making
the changes, but we're having
everyone look it over and finally
every student that votes in the
election is going to have a say
in that."
Brusstar said amending the
constitution through a non-
MSA affiliated student group

every Sunday, met last night and is
not scheduled to meet again before
tomorrow's MSA meeting.
Mahanti said the write-in can-
didates will be informed they won
and will be invited to Tuesday's
meeting, which is the last one of the
semester. They will then be sworn
in at the first MSA meeting next
semester on Jan.12.
Mahanti said he plans to work
with the candidates during winter
break.
"We'll keep in touch with them
over break, and it gives us time to
get them to learn the rules of the
road," he said.
Though the candidates will
eventually be seated, Mahanti said
the delay was unnecessary.
"This has kind of put a hitch in
everything," he said.
is better than through a Consti-
tutional Convention because the
group is more open to the student
body.
Hull said he thinks MSA should
amend the constitution internally,
possibly by creating a select com-
mittee to propose changes and
then gain a two-thirds vote of the
assembly to add them to the bal-
lot.
Rorro said he thinks the pro-
cess of amending the constitution
will be most effective if it is some-
what separated from MSA. He
said it's hard for MSA representa-
tives to support large changes to
a governmental system they are
central to.
"The inherent ability to chal-
lenge the status quo effectively is
not there when you have only peo-
ple that work within the system,"
he said.
The student group must submit
their completed petition to the
CSJ five weeks before the election,
which will take place sometime in
March. Rorro said the group is
planning to acquire the necessary
signatures the week before spring
break.
Rorro said he plans to hold
town hall-style meetings and talk
to student groups to get the 1,000
signatures.
Though the former Constitu-
tional Convention had been meet-
ing for about two months before
CSJ ordered the meetings to cease,
Brusstar said the convention got
"bogged down" in procedure and
was not very efficient.
Rorro said that in the past week
the student group seems to be
making faster progress.

feedback on their paper before
they have to turn it in for a grade,"
Speagle said.
According to the Mindbounce
website, students upload a docu-
ment and indicate an "academic
tag" - subjects ranging from
genetics to African studies. A
writing mentor who specializes
in that academic field then reads
the document and provides feed-
back on content, style or grammar,
called "bounces."
Part of Speagle's job as qual-
ity assurance manager is to make
sure these mentors are up to par
in their writing abilities. To test
these abilities, mentors are asked
to rewrite a poorly written essay.
"The essay is the biggest indica-
tor in how well they can write or
review something," Speagle said.
"And so after we read the essay,
we'll go over their r6sum6 and
then we invite them into the men-
tor pool."
According to Speagle, the web-
site employs more than a thou-
sand mentors from places from
Germany to Australia and from
backgrounds ranging from Ph.D
candidates to lawyers.
The company offers 10 free
"bounces" for first-time users.
However, these free trials also
serve as trial runs for new men-
tors, which Speagle and his team
use to evaluate the mentors. If
potential members prove strong
enough, they become paid men-
tors.
Students choose the amount of
"bounces" they want per essay.
Mindbounce's website advertises
that $9.99 translates to "4-5 pieces
of crucial feedback."
Though Speagle said feedback
currently takes as long as 12 to
24 hours to return, he said in the
future essays will likely take only
a few hours to return as busi-
ness increases and the company

expands its mentor pool.
While Speagle said using Mind-
bounce isn't necessarily better
than going to see a teacher, he said
there were some advantages, like
receiving feedback from varying
sources.
"With the varying mentor per-
spectives and each one coming
from their own educational back-
ground, it allows the document to -
get feedback from multiple peo-
ple," he said.
Speagle said while college stu- -
dents arethe primarygroup Mind-
bounce caters to, the company also
hopes to expand to other people in

"Colleges are one area of our -
target areas, but also I think
Mindbounce is really important
for people who for whatever rea-
-son were not given an adequate
education while growing up," said
Speagle.
LSA junior Hilary Markus said
she thinks Mindbounce is a "good
idea in theory."
"I don't know if I would person-
ally use it, but I think a lot of stu-
dents would take advantage of it,"
she said.
First-year Law student Julie
Bernard said she currently uses
senior judge editors - similar to
graduate student instructors -
and professors for feedback, but
that she would be open to using a
service like Mindbounce.
"I think it would be good to
have an objective set of eyes on
your work," Bernard said. "Imight
be worried about the quality of'
the person that is reading it, but I
think to have a second set of eyes
- that isn't your friend is a good
thing."
Engineering sophomore Chris
Fowlkes said he would consider
using Mindbounce for technical
papers.
"I'm in engineering, and I'll be
writing a lot of papers based on
technical composition," he said.
"That would help a lot just to veri-
fy technical things."

QW1Zdom fal s
University should replace faulty, frustrating device
t can be difficult for University professors in large classes to
get students to participate. So when the Qwizdom - an inter-
active remote control used to survey and quiz students - was
introduced to University classrooms in 2007, there was potential
for this device to strengthen student-teacher interaction in packed
lecture halls. But after two years of use in the classroom, faculty
and students are reconsidering its usefulness. The University is
right to look into replacing Qwizdom with a device that ensures a
greater degree of flexibility and reliability. But in doing so, teach-
ers should be more limiting of the role such devices play in stu-
dents' grades.

Terry, enough is enough

everal weeks ago, the Dean's
Office at the College of LSA
requested all departments to
cut their budgets by
six percent over the
next three years.
Needless to .say,
department morale
is rather low.
My personal
morale dropped
even lower when 4.
I found out that a
GSI position I had PATRICK
applied for appears O'MAHEN
to have been cut
by LSA. I suppose
I should be proud
that I can save the University roughly
$9,000 next term by being unem-
ployed, but somehow the thought of
being unable to pay my rent dims my
enthusiasm.
But I'm being selfish, and I need to
be more of team player. After all, LSA
Dean Terry McDonald is a team play-
er-he got a $63,000 raise in 2008.
Terry, you're an inspiration for all
of us. So I'm taking the torch from you
and challenging my colleagues in the
Department of Political Science to find
ways we can cut spending and increase
revenue to meet profit projections-er,
educational goals- this year.
For starters, let's start with how
we allocate office space. In the Politi-
cal Science Department, all GSIs get
office space. But we're only there for
eight to 10 hours a day. That means
that valuable space is unused more
than 60 percent of the time.
That's why I'm petitioning my
department chair, Chuck Shipan, to
mandate that GSIs find boarders for
their offices. Think of all the students

who are looking for cheap housing.
Charging them $10 a night to sleep on
our desks would bring in thousands
of dollars in revenue per month. We
could even have flexible options -
perhaps a monthly discount for long-
term boarders. I understand some
hotels turn quite a profit - and also
support local entrepreneurs - by
charging hourly rates.
But more efficient use of space is
only the start. We need to examine
how we use department and Universi-
ty resources. The obvious targets are
to cut copying and printing costs and
make faculty and staff pay for their
own staples. But these simple mea-
sures won't close a six-percent hole in
the budget. We need to think bigger.
We don't just consume the depart-
ment's paper and staples - we wear
down its floor, smudge its walls, con-
sume its water supply and breathe
its air. We need to be mindful of
this consumption. One way to raise
departmental revenue and help the
environment would be to assess indi-
vidual carbon taxes on faculty, staff
and students for exhaling carbon
dioxide. Professors known' for their
loquaciousness will be charged extra.
(You know who you are.)
Or we could steal an idea from the
Ohio Turnpike: toll booths. We'll put
them up-in front of the elevators and
department stairwells. If we charged
per person, we could enhance cash
flow by charging pregnant women a
pro-rated toll depending on how far
along gestation is. Erecting toll gates
in front of the restrooms could also
be a big cash earner, not to mention
charging for toilet paper. Why not
make it a quarter per flush? Rais-
ing the prices on feminine products

might be a real revenue spinner.
of course, these departmental
ideas will get us only so far. All of us
need to step up and take our share
of cutbacks. Personnel costs make
up much of the University's budget.
When the Lecturers' Employees
Organization starts negotiations this
January, I advise them to take one
for the team and be sensitive to LSA's
plight. After all, lecturers don't need
health insurance as much as admin-
istrators do, right? Please, be reason-
able, LEO.
The rich get
richer while the
poor get fired.
And that's my point. I understand
we need to make some cuts. But when
I'm struggling to find a job and see
people hurting around me - gradu-
ate students scrambling for funding,
janitors paying more for their health
care and lecturers waiting in vain for
the University to value their services
- I really don't have much sympathy
when I don't see cuts at the top.
Come on, Political Science depart-
ment, let's do our part. imagine how
great we'll all feel when we're able
to meet our efficiency goals and the
Board of Regents approves another
20-percent raise for Terry McDonald
in reward for his outstanding leader-
ship.

According'to the Daily, LSA Student Gov-
ernment and the faculty-run Instructional
Support Services said they're looking into
replacing the Qwizdom, a device that stu-
dents can use to answer questions the pro-
fessor asks in lectures. The search started
after students and faculty reported numer-
ous complaints about Qwizdom's techni-
cal malfunctions and incompatibility with
Apple and Windows software. University
faculty also noted difficulty using multime-
dia and Qwizdom at the same time, and neg-
ative student feedback also encouraged the
search for an alternative device. Represen-
tatives from LSA-SG and ISS said they are
considering two new options, the iClicker
and Turning Technology. According to ISS,
these systems are compatible with both Mac
and PC computers and run more smoothly
than Qwizdom.
There are many good reasons to replace
Qwizdom with better technology. The fact
that professors are unable to incorporate
other forms of media like video and audio
clips while using Qwizdom is certainly
grounds for replacing it. Professors should
feel encouraged to modernize their lectures
with multimedia, and the University needs
software that permits this. In addition, the
new devices are less likely to malfunction,
and will ultimately cause students and facul-
tyless frustration overtheir usage. As long as
they are affordable for students, one of these
new devices should replaced Qwizdom.

But whether the University replaces
Qwizdom or not, it's important to realize
that the device's major failing is not just its
technological problems, but also the fact that
it's often used as an attendance-taking pop
quiz. Using this technology to compel atten-
dance in lectures and base students' grades
on answers to rapid-fire multiple choice
questions shouldn't be classroom policy. if
teachers want students to come to class, they
should be presenting interesting, engaging
lectures covering material that will be tested
through papers and exams. Using Qwizdom-
like devices to require attendance sidesteps
this responsibility.
Legitimately used, this technology should
serve as an interactive learning tool. Teach-
ers should use it to survey their students,
gather feedback and encourage participation
in lectures. But students' grades should not
be based on quick responses to these multiple
choice questions. Instead, teachers should be
grading on comprehensive answers that are
more likely to be found in regularly sched-
uled essays and exams.
But in a sense, such attempts at encour-
aging participation through new technol-
ogy only circle around the fact that many
classes have gotten too big, making interac-
tion between students and professors more
difficult. New technology shouldn't be used
to mask the fact that the University needs to
hire more teachers to lower the amount of
bodies in some classrooms if necessary.

SAMANTHA NAWROCKI|
Access to the American"'"DREAM

BRIAN HURD |
G.I. Joe deserves a beer

Last week, President Barack Obama called
for 30,000 additional troops to be deployed to
Afghanistan over the next seven months. Given
that many of these soldiers will be between 18
and 20 years of age, how is it that the drinking
age is still 21?
Accordingto the National Youth Rights Asso-
ciation, over 700 soldiers between the ages of 18
and 20 have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan
since March 2003. Apparently, G.I. Joe is good
enough to go to Iraq but not good enough to get
into a bar. At 18, we are able to enter contracts,
have an abortion and vote: We possess the matu-
rity to sit on a jury trial, convict people of murder
and sentence them to death. The law views those
above the age of 18 as adults. But a beer still isn't
allowed.
'the Federal Highway Act of 1984 requires
states to adopt a minimum drinking age of 21 or
receive 10 percent less federal highway funding.
President Ronald Reagan thought alcohol-relat-
ed fatalities on American highways would be
reduced. In reality, his signature tied the hands
of the states and eviscerated the country's feder-
alist system. Yes, states have the right to deter-
mine the legal-drinking age. But let's be honest
- cash is king. State Budget planners would
rather fatten the states' coffers than let 18-year-
old adults enjoy a Guinness.
of course, the main argument for the law in
the first place was that it would save lives by
keeping drunk kids off the road. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration esti-
mates the increase in the minimum legal drink-
ing age saved 23,733 lives in twenty years. But
while a decreasing trend in fatalities is undeni-
able, the decline actually began in the early 1970s
- nearly a decade before the passage of the 1984
Act. Society was already beginning to see drunk
drivingwas unacceptable.
That was to due to the emergence of manda-
tory seatbelt laws and safer automobile stan-
dards - changes that contributed far more to the
decrease in fatalities than the drinking law. The
NHTSA contends the introduction of seatbelts
and airbags alone saved 206,287 lives between
1975 and 2004. More people were spared by
these safety technologies in 2002 and 2003 than
during the entire lifespan of the drinking law.

When we take a step back, we can see the
drinking policy is arbitrary. In most societies,
the right to consume alcohol coincides with the
age of adulthood, which is typically 18. In many
cases, these societies also allow minors to drink
under the supervision of adults. In the United
Kingdom, a 5-year-old can drink at home and a
16-year-old at sit-down meals. In Belgium, the
drinking age precedes the driving age. Informal,
social and cultural drinking allows adolescents
to become educated about alcohol. They learn
that drinking in moderation is natural and nor-
mal.
The United States is another story.
The World Health Organization reports 18
to 20-year-old Americans drink to the point of
intoxication in almost half of all drinking occa-
sions. Only 10 percent of the same age group do
this in Europe. Young adults in America aren't
just drinking, they're bingeing. Binge drinking -
consuming large quantities of alcohol in a short
period of time - is found to be the fashion in
which 90 percent of underage drinkers consume
alcohol, according to the Institute of Medicine.
Studies show the reasoning and judgment
portions of the brain don't fully develop until
the dge of 25. Then why is the age for activi-
ties requiring maturity only 18 or 21? One word:
education. When children begin to approach the
driving age, usually 16, they need to take a state-
mandated educational course and examination
before they are permitted to drive. Parental
supervision and instruction is a key component.
When kids turn 16, we don't simply throw them
the keys and say, "Hit the road." This would be
ludicrous. Yet, magically, at the age of 21, we tell
"real adults" to grab a bottle and go for it.
Is it fair that we hand G.I. Joe an assault rifle
but stick him with a Minor in Possession if he
holds a plastic red cup? Think of that word-
"minor." The age at which a child transitions
from "minor" to "adult" in the United States is
18, but we call these adults "minors" in drinking
situations. These minors are allowed to go to war
and vote, but holding a red plastic cup can stop
them from getting into law school or a top job.
Nothing could be more hypocritical.
Brian Hurd is a Public Policy junior.

Consider this scenario: There's thit cool guy ou sit
with in discussion section. You know his name and his
hometown. You know that he always comes five minutes
late to class because.he comes from the other side of cam-
pus, and you've laughed together while making snarky
comments about the GSI's verbal tics. He wants to gradu-
ate and go to medical school. He's going to make the Uni-
versity's Alumni Association really happy, buy premium
seats at the Big House and make his newborn kids wear
Wolverine onesies.
What if he turned to you tomorrow and told you that he
needed you to make his dream a reality? What if he told
you that you had the power to help him? Would you sup-
port him and fight for him?
He's an undocumented immigrant - he was born in
another country, and there are thousands of students like
him in the United States. In many cases, parents brought
students like him to the U.S. when they were children. He
may have grown up watching American television and
celebrating Thanksgiving. But when it's time to go to col-
lege, he either can't attend or needs financial aid.
If he graduates from college, he then learns that no U.S.
citizenship means he can't actually work in the country.
So he's told to go back to the country he left as a child and
can barely remember.
At the University, we've answered his kind of call
before. During the civil rights movement, students led
protests and fought for a more inclusive campus. Ann
Arbor is the kind of place where we should fight for the
rights of our classmates - brotherhood is not just for
football games.
In October of 2007, this dream alinost became a reality
HARUN BULJNA

for these students. The Development, Relief and Educa-
tion for Alien Minors Act would provide a path to citizen-
ship for those who arrive in the country before the age
of 16 and obtain at least two years of higher education or
two years of military service. In other words, the DREAM
Act is the change that undocumented immigrant students
across the country desperately need.
It gained 52 votes in the Senate, just 8 short of the
filibuster-proof margin it needed to move forward. Not
approving this legislation was an inexcusable and cow-
ardly act, and those missing 8 votes shattered the dreams
of thousands of students - students that are just as quali-
fied to gain an education as any other American.
Thankfully, the DREAM Act was reintroduced to
Congress this year. In hopes of its passage, more than
a dozen groups, including university clubs, academic
departments, local retailers and community-based orga-
nizations, are coming together to host a series of events
this week. We invite you to join with your friend at 6:30
p.m. tonight in Angell Hall Auditorium D for a workshop
on the DREAM Act. We also hope you can join us on
Wednesday night at 7 p.m. in Angell Hall Auditorium C
for the first-ever Michigan screening of the riveting new
documentary film, "Papers."
So it's time to meet the challenge and help out a friend.
You can choose to "meekly live, going slow, slow, slow" (in
Langston Hughes's words), or you can pick up the pace,
make a phone call and sign the petition. Your friend's
dream can't wait.
This viewpoint was submitted by Samantha Nawrocki
on behalf of Migrant and Immigrant Rights Awareness.

By KRISTYN ACHO
Daily Arts Writer
Apologies are in order for every other indie band
that recorded an album in 2009. They didn't have a
fighting chance: 2009 will forever
be known as the year ofAnimal Col- *
lective. Resident indie gods among
us, Animal Collective set the bar in Animal
early January with the innovative ConecW
Merriweather Post Pavilion, gar-
nering an obsessed cult following Fall Be Kind
claiming Animal Collective as the Domino
"true" indie rockers among a sea
of pseudo-indie rockers. In a day and age when indie
rock has become almost a misnomer, Animal Collec-
tive is making music that's indie in every sense of the
word. It's actually independent: The band has its own
style, trumping the paltry, generic indie rock being
manufactured by so many record labels today.
Fall Be Kind is the perfect conclusion to a ban-
ner year for Animal Collective. Instead of trying
to top the success of Merriweather, the EP's sound
explores a similar realoh tempering with trippy
synths and loops while employing a chillier, melan-
cholic demeanor.
Opener "Graze" unfolds in a sleepy spiral,
with the juxtaposition of fairy tale-esque strings,
twinkling piano keys and Avey Tave's continuous
chants "let me begin," leaving listeners in a bliss-
ful daze that - out of nowhere - launches into a
renaissance fair jive. Yup. Complete with pan flute,

dude," the second part of the song seems to come
out of nowhere. But a lack of fluidity is what makes
Animal Collective sound so definable.and unique -
with all its twists and turns, what remains is a joy-
ful mess of seriously complex sound.
"What Would I Want? Sky" is next, with the EP's
easiest listen. Convoluted with the band's charac-
teristic strangeness, dizzying vocals are interposed
with water-imitating feedback and crashing cym-
bals that gradually float into the clouds. Halfway
through the track, a dreamy melody is exposed,
intertwining with a simple drum beat, bursting
chimes and the aid of the Grateful Dead's "Unbro-

This is an album cover, apparently.
ken Chain" over Tare's probing vocals, "Is every-
thing all right? / You feeling moany? / You feeling
stony? / You're not the only."
The meld of the Grateful Dead as the main event
could have left the track feeling slapped together,
but it proves to be one of the breeziest recordings of
the band's career. Parts of the track feel like a full-on
pop song that could easily go mainstream. Following
in the footsteps of upbeat, catchy tracks like Mer-
riweather's "My Girls" and "Summertime Clothes,"
"Sky" is a masterful creative endeavor that will like-
ly garner the band an even wider fan-base.
"Bleed" and "On a Highway" are moody, foggy
ballads that are similar to the eccentric, abstract
quality of tracks on earlier albums like Feels.
"Bleed" is an eerie, haunting interlude that sets the
tone for the final darker tracks of the EP. The tex-
tured track coarsely meanders along, trading off
emotions with the alternating lyrics "I feel hope-
ful" and "I feel shameful," before morphing into
"On A Highway." "Highway" deals with the tor-
ments of loneliness and boredom that come with
the life of a touring musician. Over sonic waves,
electric synths and echoing vocals, Tare depicts
life: "I let some hash relax me / Get lost in human
pleasure." Those hippies.
Fall concludes with "I Think I Can," using snaps
and claps to return to the upbeat demeanor of the
EP's earlier tracks. While EPs can often times
feel like a hodgepodge of songs left off of various
albums, Fall Be Kiid is the epitome of flow and
cohesion. With this EP, Animal Collective ends a
chapter in its career of creating psychedelic, inno-
vative outfits.

ALCOHOL
From Page 1A
more so for people who have a
really negative experience inside
the stadium."
At the same time, Desprez
stressed that if the University
were to implement a similar pro-
gram, it would not just duplicate
another program, but rather it
would create something specifi-
cally designed for the University's
community and its needs.
"Whatever strategies we use,
they must be effective for our
own community," she said. "We
can't just take another program,
we need to think in terms of our
community."
Currently, there is no blanket
policy for what happens to season
ticket holders when they're eject-
ed from the Big House for exces-
sive drinking.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said the Athletic Depart-
ment makes the decision of how
to handle cases of excessive
drinking and DPS treats the cases
like it would any other alcohol-
related incident on campus.
"DPS only deals with the
legal issues just like an alcohol
infraction anywhere on cam-
pus," Brown said. "Athletics
addresses any potential other
consequences."
During the 2009 football sea-
son, 30 University students were

ejected for alcohol-related issues,
according to Brown.
"This includes those who were
arrested, issued a citation or court
summons or simply ejected,"
Brown said. "In all 30 instances,
the students were ejected from
that football game."
However, the Athletic Depart-
ment does not currently have a
procedure for handling ejections
due to excessive drinking.
"We do not have any sanctions
on students removed from the
stadium," said Michael Steven-
son, executive associate director
of athletics.
Desprez said before a program
like Check BAC or Show and Blow
could be implemented at the Uni-
versity, it would first be impor-
tant to gather large amounts of
input from all affected parties.
"We don't have anything insti-
tuted that involves the breatha-
lyzer," she said. "One of the most
important things to do before we
start any type of program is to get
all the stakeholders around the
table and see what it would do for
this community."
Accordingto Desprez, stake-
holders include the Department
of Public Safety, the Athletic
Department, Alcohol and Drug
Prevention, students and season
ticket holders.
Though the UniversityofMich-
igan has no plans to implement a
probationary program, Show and
Blow has been a success, school

officials said, and is currently in
its third year of operations. The
program was piloted during the
2005-2006 school year and had
about 77 students participate this
past season.
"The easy thing to do is to tell
kids they can't go to many games,
and it would have been a fair con-
sequence," said Ervin Cox, direc-
tor of student assistance judicial
affairs at Wisconsin. "But we
decided we wanted to let them
come back, but they had to be
sober if they wanted to."
"The students that have gone
through the program think it's
fair," Cox said. "Other students
think that if they can't drink for
a football game, it ruins their Sat-
urdays, but our response is that if
they can't go through a Saturday
without drinking, they probably
need to seek help."
However, Cox said many stu-
dents drink rather than attending
the football games to avoid being
on the Show and Blow list.
"Our student section is only
half full at kickoff. We have a
bad culture here that Saturdays
are about drinking and partying
rather than watching football,"
Cox said. "Kids who do come at
halftime leave by the end of the
quarter to go party after."
But Cox said the program has a
positive impact overall.
"Most students don't like kids
who are stumbling and puking
all over the student section. Our

goal is to send a message about
a second chance that you can
enjoy a game without drinking
and that you don't really want to
get on that list in the first place,"
he said.
The University of Minnesota
implemented Check BAC at the
start of this season along with
their new football stadium.
Students are made aware of the
consequences of showing up to
a game excessively drunk when
they sign the "Golden Gophers
make Golden Choices" fan code
of conduct.
"We don't go looking for kids
but if someone can't walk, is
throwing up or is visibly drunk,
the copswill approach them," said
Amy Barsness, associate director
of the student conduct and aca-
demic integrity at the University
of Minnesota.
If a student gets ejected and
tries to enter the next game with-
out taking a breathalyzer, Bars-
ness said her office is made aware
of the situation through the com-
puterized ticket system and the
student's season package is then
revoked.
"We've had a high turnaround
rate," Barsness said. "Most kids
come back. They're happy they
have a second chance to go. At
the beginning we had people con-
cerned about it, but now people
understand that we want (stu-
dents) to soberly enjoy the game.
Students are on board with that."

CLIMATE CHANGE
From Page 1A
events that focus on global warm-
ing's effect on the world's water
supply. She said that while she's
there she will also be blogging for
the Detroit Free Press.
"I will be covering the inter-
sections of how water and cli-
mate change are related - (things
like) agriculture and irrigation
and torrential storms and El Nifno
and recent storms like Hurricane
Katrina. Things like that that are
attributed in great part to global
climate change," she said.
Rackham graduate student Nich-
olas Parker, meanwhile, said he is
going to Copenhagen because he's
interested in international develop-
ment and how developing countries
handle abiding by climate change
policies.
"My research is geared towards
the adaptation side of things -
how developing nations are going
to adapt and they're going to fund
adaptation activities. And not
just developing nations, but here
at home," he said. "So, where the
money is going to be coming from
and how it's going to be spent.
Those are some serious questions
that are unresolved right now."
Originally, organizers of the
conference had hoped to produce
a binding resolution that would
limit carbon emissions to curb cli-
mate change and stop rising sea

Monday, December 7, 2009 - 7A
levels. It's expected, however, that
world leaders will not sign a final
agreement this year, but rather an
interim one, with the plan to con-
vene again in 2010 to sign a binding
treaty.
Despite this, leaders are optimis-
tic as the United States, China and
India - three of the world's larg-
est emitters of greenhouse gases
- have each made commitments
to substantially lower their emis-
sions.
Rood said, however, that he isn't
sure the emissions reductions goals
are the best options in the fight
against climate change.
"Itwould be a wonderful thing, if
we did in fact make some real prog-
ress on reducing emissions," Rood
said. "My biggest concern is that
those goals - while they would be
admirable almost to show we can
do it in and of themselves - they
don't reduce the emissions enough
to have large consequences on the
climate."
Instead, Rood said he hopes the
leaders focus on short-term goals in
termsofcarbonemissionsreduction
that are more attainable, instead of
long-term goals that many scien-
tists say are unreachable.
"What I would like to see is
strong solid commitments to the
things that we know that would
work, which for the most part
would also save money, which is
efficiency," Rood said. "We have to
develop technology to make alter-
native energy sources viable."

Alljazzed up for 2009

"Fun fact: These are not my hands."
Jones's rise and'Fall'

With a little help from her
friends, Norah Jones more than
gets by on her latest disc
By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Arts Writer
Norah Jones was probably your mom's favorite
artist at some point. With that smoky, silky voice and
those cabaret-pop arrangements,
Jones's music is, for all intents and
purposes, pretty safe stuff. It was
precisely this smooth formula that NrhJones
garnered her debut album, 2002's
Come Away with Me, multiple The Fall
Grammys, and that has kept her on Blue Note/EMI
Starbucks music racks and family
living room stereos ever since.
Strange, then, that Jones's newest album, The
Fall, is her deliberate attempt to try her hand at
harder, edgier sounds on an album billed asa "rock"
record. Jones enlisted songwriters Ryan Adams and
Will Sheff (Okkervil River) to collaborate on a few
songs (not surprisingly the best two on the record),
and assembled a cast of more rock-pedigreed musi-
cians to spruce up the arrangements: Joey Waronker
(R.E.M. and Beck) sits in on drums, along with gui-
tarists Smokey Hormel (Johnny Cash, Joe Strum-
mer) and Marc Ribot (Tom Waits, Elvis Costello).
So, with all this in place, does the record "rock"?
Well, as it turns out, not really. But that's OK.
While the songs on The Fall retain a lot of the
breeziness and rhythmic safety that made her past
records fairly innocuous, they are noticeably more

guitar-driven and loose. The deft hands of Jones's
guest musicians help her tremendously, giving each
song a more unwound, freewheeling and live feel.
While Jones's vocals are expectedly in the fore,
much emphasis is placed on the musicians them-
selves, with long instrumental codas and introduc-
tions appearing throughout the record.
Lead-off track and first single "Chasing Pirates"
is propelled by a grooving Rhodes keyboard and a
winding vocal melody, each with a vintage feel rem-
iniscent of early soul records of the '70s. Adams's
contribution, "Light as a Feather," is darker and
moodier, withstormy folk arrangements and Jones's
voice evoking Emmylou Harris.
Sheff's "Stuck" is most notable, combining lilting
melodies and wide-eyed Tex-Mex soul that sound
more at home in an Austin bar than a New York jazz
club. Closing track "Man of the Hour" is minimal but
endearing, with Jones playfully crooning about her
inability to "choose between a vegan and a pothead."
While The Fall is impressive to a point - Jones
has a brilliant voice, with an incredible knack for
melody and texture - it does little to dispel her
image as tame chanteuse. As with her other records,
her songwriting and delivery lack adventure -
Adams and Sheff's songwriting are miles beyond
Jones's, and it shows.
Despite some shortcomings, The Fall is a good
listen - all people could use a little latte-rock in
their iTunes library. And though these songs are
relatively light, don't expect the same jazz-pop lul-
labies that made Jones's career in the past - there's
a good helping of fuzzed-out guitar and instrumen-
tal interplay and plenty of soul-drenched vocals to
be found. Having said that, you're mom's probably
going to like it.

BROTHERS
From Page 5A
First and foremost, "Brothers" is a narrative. Aris-
totle said that the greatest aspect of tragedy lies in
neither character nor quality of writing, but in plot.
In this facet, writer David Benioff ("25th Hour") and
director Jim Sheridan ("My Left Foot") indisputably
excel. The film is not a mechanism for overacting thes-
pians to strut around and chew scenery. Instead, the
cast members to synergistically feed off of each other,
working together for a common cause, wholly and
completely dedicated to the story. When necessary,
the performances can be wonderful, thrilling and
frightening, but also subtle and low-key. Portman, for
her part, seems content to bow out of the spotlight to
the more important characters when that's what her
character dictates.

song structures.
A couple of the year's best
"jazz" releases have actually
been jazz-electronica hybrids.
While there may be a gaping
generational spilt between the
heyday of these two genres, their
fusion actually makes perfect
sense. Jazz, a genre that's always
been about pushing the boundar-
ies, is practically tailor-made for
the synthesized sonic infinity
that electronic production pro-

these elements in exotic studio-
produced worlds. On "1972,"
the album takes an ethereal
flute composition reminiscent
of a beatnik nightclub and digi-
crunches it eerily with tweaked
game show noises over a limber
trip-hop beat. And trumpeter
Ben Neill has smudged these
generic boundaries with his
invention of the "mutantrum-
pet," an instrument that blends
brass with silicon, employing an
analog processing system that
allows him to digitally alter his
music on the fly. Night Science,
his broodingly minimalist 2009
release, sounds much closer in
spirit to dub-step than to jazz.
So while it's almost a given
that none of these albums will
find their way onto any of this
year's standard-issue year-end
lists, they are certainly worth
knowing about (Double Booked by
Robert Glasper and O'o by John
Zorn are also work checking out).
The only issue: These albums are
not readily available for illegal

But where Sheridan particularly shines is in direct-
ing children. In cinema, a child is rarely allowed to
possess a personality. Sheridan manages to skirt the 4
obligatorily cute, precocious nonsense in favor of
a depiction rooted in emotion and dimensionality.
The best scene of the movie is performed not by an
adult, but by elder daughter Isabelle (Bailee Madison,
"Bridge to Terabithia"). The scene is a harrowing out-
burst charged with emotional energy and bile. Even
though she will probably never be recognized for it,
her performance is the stuff of Oscar gold.
"Brothers" is a blisteringly real depiction of the
overarching effects ofa soldier coming home, as bril-
liantly muscular as it is intimate. But this isn't to say
that "Brothers" is pitch perfect: The message of "war
is bad" runs too simplistically, and it can get a little
tiresome watching Portman mourn for two hours.
Despite his slightly moralizing tone, Sheridan man-
ages to gather up the ribbons of dissent and tie them

SAM WOLON/Daily
Senior DeShawn Sims tallied 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead Michigan past Arkansas- Pine Bluff. The Detroit native led the charge for the struggling Wolverines after the team only managed to tie the Golden Lions through the first half of Saturday's gamn.

lege last week, senior and

Sims notched four points and .
four rebounds in just 23 minutes.
Part of the issue was foul trou-

Sims just didn't
show up. JOE
Saturday STAPLETON
was a differ-
ent story. At On Men's
halftime of the Basketball
Wolverines'
67-53 win against Arkansas-Pine
Bluff, Michigan was tied at 32
with an 0-5 team relatively new
to Division I. And this time, Sims
was the only one who played
well - he had 15 points at the
break.
While it was great for fans to
see Sims coming back and look-

can be, his performance pointed
to one of his greatest flaws:
inconsistency.
This has been a knock on Sims
ever since he first donned the
maize and blue - it's old news.
The not-so-old news: Michigan
needs him to start finding some
consistency fast, because he is
the single most important player
on the team.
The question is how can Sims,
a player with talent through the
roof who at times disappears in
stretches during games, find a
way to perform at a high level,
game after game?
While Saturday's game
against the Golden Lions may
have seemed like a ho-hum,
somewhat disappointing game, it
holds the answer to that question
and the key to Michigan's suc-

In fact, Sims himself touched
on it in the locker room after the
game.
"They just went to me," Sims
said. "Coach stressed that we
play from the inside out today
and we executed the game plan."
There it is - inside out. A
phrase Michigan fans have been
dying to hear all season after
watching an offense that seems
to always be going outside in.
Throughout the early season,
Michigan coach John Beilein has
said Sims is working on beinga
more complete player - refining
his outside shot and his ability
to score from the wing-- even
though he has traditionally
found success down low.

but we're also, in practice, trying

There are still problems, and
the Wolverines know that. One
torrid second-half run doesn't
change much.
But with the Michigan men's
basketball team's 67-53 win over
Arkansas-Pine Bluff, the Wol-
verines showed they can still
grab momentum at any given
moment.
After taking just two shots
in the first half and playing
uncharacteristically passively on
offens'e, junior forward Manny
Harris tallied 14 points in the
opening eight minutes of the sec-
ond half to lead a 17-5 Michigan
run.l
A halftime tie turned into a

comfortable lead and the Wolver-
ines (4-3) cruised from there, but
it took much longer than anyone
on the team would have liked.
Michigan shot just 4-of-21 from
the outside in the first frame,
including 3-of-15 from behind
the arc. Each miss magnified the
defensive lapses that allowed
Arkansas-Pine Bluff (0-6) to stay
within striking distance.
And Michigan coach John Bei-
lein seemed very concerned that
several of the team's sharpshoot-
ers couldn't break out of their ear-
ly-season slump.
"The best players that were out
there were getting good shots,"
Beilein said. "And other guys who
were out there wide open didn't
make them. You tell me another
day when you're going to see Zack

(Novak) and Stu (Douglass) go
1-of-11 (on 3-pointers). ... People
are going to keep packing it in
until we get it going (from the
perimeter)."
Harris, Novak and Douglass -
last season's primary three-point
shooters - have combined to hit
23 of 93 shots from behind the
arc in the team's first six games.
Redshirt sophomore guard Laval
Lucas-Perry, who opened Satur-
day with two quick triples, has
been the lone offensive bright spot

Blue bound for NCAA Sweet 16

ICE HOCKEY
After hitting new low,
'earns series split

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Writer
On Saturday, the ingredients
for the Michigan volleyball team
to advance to the Sweet 16 of the
NCAA Tournament were there:
experience, senior leadership and
a refuse-to-give-up mentality.
But it took a 2-0 match deficit
for those ingredients to start boil-
ing.
The 16th-ranked Wolverines
squared off against Ohio Univer-
sity in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament on Saturday
after advancing past Niagara the
night before.
And after two sets, the Bob-
cats looked like they would easily
advance to the third round.
"We looked at each other
(after the second set) and refused
to lose," senior captain Megan
Bower said.
That's when Michigan's
strengths began to surface.
Experience.
In last year's NCAA Tourna-
ment, the Wolverines were down
2-1 in the first and second round
and rallied to win in five sets on
both occasions.

Michigan (26-9) had been in
a come-from-behind situation
before, and this predicament
was nothing new for the veteran
team.
All of the Wolverines' current
starters played in last year's tour-
nament, so everyone had the con-
fidence and trust in each other to
rebound from the 2-0 hole.
But against Ohio, the Wolver-
ines would have to win three sets
in a row after losing the first two,
a feat the team hadn't accom-
plished all season.
"This team has been playing
together for two years, and we
just looked into each other's eyes,
and we knew we were going to
win," outside hitter Juliana Paz
said.
The Wolverines were facing an
Ohio team that upended Notre
bame - the Big East undefeated
regular season champion - the
previous night in five sets.
Michigan's offensive average
was an abysmal .172 in the first
two frames.

the con-
ference, a
position it hasn't finished in since
the 1978 season - three years
before the Wolverines joined the
CCHA.
To come out of the cellar,
Michigan was forced with to do
something it has done just two
times before this season - win
the Saturday game after a loss in
a weekend series. The Wolverines
managed to win 2-1.
The weekend started out like
many others this season, with
Michigan falling behind early. But

unlike games earlier in the season
against Miami (Ohio) and Michi-
gan State, Michigan showed signs
of life instead of laying down.
In Friday's second period, soph-
omore Luke Glendening picked up
a turnover at the Wolverine blue
line and beat an Ohio State defen-
semen to the outside. As Glenden-
ing was about to go behind the
net, his backhand beat Ohio State
goaltender Cal Heeter over the left
shoulder.
"We stayed pretty positive
on the bench," Glendening said.
"We're confident. We were down
2-0, but it didn't seem to faze us
much."
Michigan scored again to tie
the game, but two quick Buckeye
goals to start the third period
sealed the loss.
Even though Michigan
couldn't pull out the win, Glen-
dening's goal jumpstarted the
team's the offensive momentum
for the rest of the weekend. The

IOWA CITY - With Michigan up
by one against Iowa and two min-
utes left in the game, both teams
were desperate for possession.
But as the 2,300-person crowd at
Carver-Hawkeye Arena yelled and
screamed, the Wolverines calmly
held onto their lead.
Despite Iowa's home-court
advantage and lopsided 41-15 all-
time series edge, Michigan was able
to eke out a 54-51 victory to open Big
Ten play.
"Most of the games thatare being
won are by big margins," junior
guard Veronica Hicks said. "But I
think this win was something great
for us because it shows that even
if you try to slow us down, we can
fight that adversity and come out
on top, and I think that's something
that's really huge."
The fans came alive in the last
minutes of the game after the
Hawkeyes surged in the second half
to narrow Michigan's lead to five
with just five minutes left on the
clock.
"I don'tcknow that we were overly
aggressive," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said. "I don't know that
many of our players wanted the ball.
At the end I think (Hicks) knew she
needed to have it. I think (senior
center Krista Phillips) wanted it.
They are veterans. But I don't think
the other kids really wanted to have
the basketball and you have to want
that, especially at crunch time."
The Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten, 6-2
overall) were able to use momentum
from early in the game to stave off
the aggressive Hawkeyes when it
mattered most. Michigan's energy
was evident prior to the game as the
team jumped and danced in its pre-
game huddle. And that energy was
crucial in Michigan's fight until the

buzzer.
Early in the game, when Phil-
lips won the tipoff and later got the
ball back for a layup, the Wolverines
took advantage. That momentum
translated into a 12-2 run in the
first five minutes for Michigan, who
never relinquished the lead.
But the Hawkeyes pulled within
five with three minutes left in the
first half before Michigan went on a
9-0 run, led by Phillips' shots from
the post and Hicks' consecutive
layups.
Michigan held its lead comfort-
ably for much of the second half, but
was unable to keep the Hawkeyes
from making the game a nailbiter in
the last two minutes. Iowa (0-1 Big
Ten, 5-4 overall) threatened with
a 7-1 run to make the score 52-51
Michigan. Neither team scored
again until freshman guard Day-
eesha Hollins scored a layup at the
buzzer.
In Michigan's most physical

game this season, bothsides record-
ed numerous fouls. Iowa was able to
capitalize on those fouls late in the
game to put pressure on the Wolver-
ines.
"(Iowa's defense) is definitely
an in-your-face kind of thing, and
you just run right into it," fresh-
man guard Jenny Ryan said. "So
it's everything that people say, and
then, I guess you get ready for it
mentally."
Once Iowa narrowed Michigan's
lead to one with less than two min-
utes remaining, fouls became even
more important. Luckily for the
Wolverines, the Hawkeyes weren't
able to capitalize on any of those
opportunities.
After Iowa's last chance at the
line, it took a team effort by the
Wolverines to score that lastbasket.
Hollins's layup increased the lead
to three and sealed the victory that
could have so easily slipped away in
the waning minutes.

Every week, Michigan fans hold
signs that read "team defense."
The signs are deserved -- the
Wolverines' style of defense
makes up for their size disadvan-
tage. Even though Michigan was
outrebounded 41-37 last night,
the team made up for it, forcing18
turnovers compared to Iowa's 14.
"I love 'team defense,' " Ryan
said. "I love to get into the pass-

Even more impressive was the
Wolverines' edge in blocks. Mich-

compared to Iowa's five.

COLUMBUS - Midwaythrough
the third period of Friday night's
game against Ohio State, the Mich-
igan hockey team was in complete
control.

Ohio State goalie Cal Heeter, a sta-
tistic countered by just 14 Buckeye
shots. The Wolverines had knotted
the game at 2-2, coming back from
a two-goal deficit. And the way
they were buzzing in the Buckeyes'
zone, it seemed that scoring the
winning goal was only a matter of
time.
But in the blink of an eye, all of
that momentum was erased. Ohio
State struck withtwogoals inaspan
of 2:18 and held on for a 5-3 victory.
While Michigan's inability to capi-
talize on scoring chances kept the
Buckeyes in the game, what hurt
most was the Wolverines' lack of
consistency in the defensive zone.
"It's a game of mistakes," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said after
the loss. "If you make mistakes in
your own zone, you're going to pay
for them."
Despite being outshot 45-20
for the game, the Buckeyes made
the most of their chances each
time Michigan had a defensive
lapse.
Buckeye forwards were wide
open in the slot for two of the goals
on Friday, one of which resulted
from a turnover behind the net.
Another goal occurred on the rush,
and only one Michigan blue liner
was back to defend the pass.

combined in the two games. To
climb out of the CCHA cellar,
the team looked to their senior
captain Chris Summers to pull
them out of the hole on Satur-
day. And he responded.
Halfway through Saturday's
first period, Michigan won a
faceoff in the offensive zone and
set the faceoff play in motion.
Two passes later, Summers
took the puck and wristed it
into the left corner of the net.
"Any time you get the first
goal of the game, especially in
the first period, the momentum
is going your way," Summers
said. "That's what we've talked
about all year ... make sure we
go out and get that first goal
that changes the entire game."
Summers' goal was the only
marker until junior Matt Rust
put in the eventual game-win-
ner on a power play goal early in
the third. The win pulled Mich-
igan up to tenth of 12 teams in
the conference.

VOLLEYBALL
From page B
Ohio (27-7) had time to set up its
block and prevent the Wolverine
offense from grabbing momentum.
After the break, Michigan ran
out of the locker room with the
game plan necessary to fuel a
comeback.
The Wolverines (26-9) got back
into their rhythm due in large part
to junior setter Lexi Zimmerman's
play.

ference. ... Our team has high
expectations. We're trying to
get better every game, and today

Getting better every game
doesn't always mean wins.
Michigan still stands 16 points
behind CCHA leader Miami and
was swept by the RedHawks in
the teams' only series this sea-

If the Wolverines want to
find themselves in more famil-
iar territory at the top of the
standings, continuing to split
with teams like the Buckeyes
(5-6-1-1, 7-10-1) will make it
impossible for the Wolverines
to catch up.
"As far as the standings are
concerned, I think that's kind of
in the back of our mind," Sum-
mers said. "Some guys might use
that as motivation, but I think
as a team, we're going to work
to improve for every game."
After the Golden Lions shot 14-of-
26 in the first half, the Wolverines
held Arkansas-Pine Bluff to just 27
percent shooting after the break.
Part of that percentage can also
be explained by the Golden Lion
offense averaging out.
Arkansas-Pine Bluff was shoot-

"That's just heart and players who-

Seniors Paz and Veronica Rood

seniors who carried Michigan
against the Bobcats, and if the
team expects to have any shot at
beating fourth-seeded Stanford
this upcoming weekend, it'll take
that same type of performance and
execution.
"The skill part (of our seniors)
has been great," Rosen said. "But

Tankers cruise in EMU tourney

YPSILANTI - Winning more
than half of the 20 events, the
Michigan women's swimming and
diving team easily left Ypsilanti
this weekend with its seventh
straight EMU invitational title.
The 19th-ranked Wolverines
scored 1123 points, 307 points
more than the second-place team,
in a meet where the competition
was not as strong as in past con-
tests.
"I don't worry so much as
whether it's a big meet or not a big
meet," Michigan coach Jim Rich-
ardson said. "It's 25 yards, and
there is water. You've got a chance
to work on something and try to
improve something, and that's
what we're always trying to do."
Leading the way for the Wol-
verines was senior Margaret
Kelly, who, over the two-day peri-
od, won the 200-yard butterfly,
200-yard individual medley and
so-yard freestyle. She was also a
member of all of the Wolverines'
winning freestyle relays.
Senior Emily Brunemann, the
2008 NCAA champion in the
1,650-yard freestyle, did not swim
the event. But senior Emily Han-
son stepped up and won the event
for Michigan, capturing a NCAA
consideration time of 16:38.28.

at. I've been training real well all
season and gotten pretty consis-
tent results."
About eight Wolverines were
half tapered for this meet, mean-
ing they were somewhat rested.
The rest of the team is continuing
a strenuous training regimen.
"It's not a full taper," Richard-
son said. "We don't believe that
we need to rest a whole lot at
this point in the season because
of the nature of the training that
we're doing. It's enough to get
a good glimpse of where people
are right now and what their
potential can be at the end of the
season."
At the beginning of the year,

Richardson and his staff decid-
ed to increase the Wolverines'
weightlifting load, hoping that
it would make the team stronger
and ultimately faster.
"It was a conscious decision we
made this year to try and make
improvements, and that was one
area we felt we could improve,"
Richardson said. "We felt like
we could be stronger, and if we
do a good job of transferring that
strength into power, then we have
a better than average chance of
swimming faster by the end of the
year."

The strength that they have
built and are still building was
evident, considering how easily
the Wolverines dominated their
opponents.
Michigan's chemistry and
camaraderie was also apparent
during the meet. The swimmers
were constantly slapping hands,
laughing and just generally hav-
ing a good time on the deck.
"I am having an absolute blast,"
Hanson said. "Our team is such a
tight-knit group. There's still a lot
left to the season, but I am having
a lot of fun."

Biondo withdraws
from tournament
with knee injury
By AMY PARLAPIANO
For the Daily
If the Michigan wrestlingteam's
season so far could be summa-
rized in a two-word phrase, it's a
"learning experience." The latest
lesson for the young team came
this weekend at the Cliff Keen
Las Vegas Invitational, where the
Wolverines placed 16th overall.
Michigan is still a team in tran-
sition, with more than half of its
squad made up of freshmen and
sophomores. These large tourna-
ments - this one 42 teams - are
excellent ways for the younger
wrestlers to gain confidence. In
the past, the Wolverines would
aim to win this tournament. But
coach Joe McFarland knows that
this year, the major goal is to
use this kind of tournament as a
building block. It was also a great
way for his young team to get
some experience against tough,
ranked teams like Ohio State and
Cornell.
"We're going through some
SIMS
From page 1B
to develop him so that he can play
at the next level," Beilein said
after a game against Northern
Michigan on Nov.14. "And his
next level is not as a post man.
We want him to have a skill level
where he can do things on the
outside, and he can use some ath-
leticism."
Beilein said that after the
team's season-opening win in
which junior Manny Harris
posted a triple-double, Sims had a
double-double and freshman Matt
Vogrich went 5-of-5 from 3-point
land.
Those were better days, to be
sure.
Now, Sims is disappearing at
times during games, Harris's
hamstring is bothering him more
than ever, and the thought of
any Wolverine going 5-of-5 from
beyond the arc is about as far-
fetched as Terrelle Pryor finding a
cure for cancer.
It would be nice if Sims had
the luxury of playing outside and
fine-tuning his guard skills to pre-
pare for the NBA, but he doesn't.
Michigan's recent struggles have
upped the stakes in every game
they play before the Big Ten sea-
son starts, which means it needs
Sims to perform now more than
ever.
And Saturday's game proved
that in order for Sims to play well,
and Michigan to win, he needs to
return to his roots.
"I was definitely more focused
on staying on the block and show-
ing my moves," Sims said after
Saturday's win. "And I was effi-
cient today."
In the first half, like the halves
in all of Michigan's losses, the

growing pains," McFarland said.
"We still need to work on our
intensity level. Intensity comes
with confidence, and it's a hard
thing because you need that
intensity to get those wins, and
you need those wins to get your
confidence."
One of the ways the younger
Wolverines learned about wres-
tling was by watching team cap-
tain Anthony Biondo, who has
talked in the past about leading
by example. The redshirt junior
hasn't lost a match for the team
since Nov. 7.
Earlier in the young season,
Biondo struggled with stay-
ing aggressive all match, even
though he was winning them.
That was not the case this week-
end. The captain advanced to
the semifinals after defeating
Cornell's Cam Simaz thanks to
a last-second offensive strike in
the final period.
"I thought he had a great
tournament," McFarland said.
"When Anthony wrestles hard
and he puts complete matches
together, he can beat anyone in
the country."
Biondo ultimately took 6th
place at 197 pounds with a 3-0
record. After hurting his knee

in an earlier match, McFarland
made the decision that it would
be wisest to withdraw him from
the tournament to avoid further
risk.
This weekend's meet was a test
to see if the Wolverines could
capitalize on the momentum they
generated in last week's come-
from-behind victory against
Penn State. The team went out to
Las Vegas and showed they were
capable of being successful, as
all 10 wrestlers won at least one
match throughout the two-day
tournament.
McFarland and his team
watched the championship
matches and saw what it takes
to win big tournaments. They
learned from some of the best
teams that it takes aggressive-
ness, consistency and a refusal to
give up.
"In a tough tournament like
that, you have to be in the battle
and fight every second out there,"
McFarland said. "I'm hoping we
got a lot out of this tournament
and our guys are really trying
to figure out and understand
what to do to win a tournament
like this, and the effort that they
need to have when they step on
the mat."

Despite trailing No. 3 California
by six points entering the third and
final day of this weekend's AT&T
USA Swimming Short Course
National Championships, the No.
7 Michigan men's swimming and
diving team easily overcame the
deficit to win the meet for the sec-
ond consecutive year.
Michigan beat a field of NCAA
teams that included California,
No.12 Southern California and
No. 18 Indiana, as well as dozens
of private clubs, at the three-day
meet in Federal Way, Wash.
Four individual top-five fin-
ishes on the last day of the meet
fueled the Wolverines' come-
from-behind victory, as Michigan
finished the competition 46 points
ahead of California. Junior Tyler
Clary finished third in both the
200-yard backstroke and butterfly
events, sophomore Dan Madwed
touched fifth in the 200-yard but-
terfly and freshman Ryan Feeley
placed fifth in the 1,650-yard free-
style.
"What we wanted coming in to
the meet was to not be rested and
swim the events that we will be
swimming at the end of the year
and learn how to swim them,"
Michigan coach Mike Bottom said
through the Athletic Department.
"Not trusting that we are rested
but trusting in our goals. We want-
ed to focus on things that they
needed to learn and do right when
it is the end of a race."
Clary, who is recovering from
the HCN1 u, did not start the
meet quite the way he had wanted.
After he was seeded first in both
the 500-yard freestyle and the
200-yard individual medley, he
was visibly upset after finishing
the events in eighth and eleventh,
respectively.
He and Bottom considered
withdrawing from some of his
other events, but eventually Clary
said he decided to "set the example
that it does not matter how you are
feeling, you have to get the work
done."
His subsequent swims were
much better. In addition to his
third-place performances on the
final day of the meet, he touched
third in the 400-yard individual

Junior Tyler Clary turned heads with a strong perfomance in Washington.

medley and won the meet's high-
point award.
"I came back with the attitude
that this is going to be the kind of
a meet where I can work on the
details," he said through the Ath-
letic Department. "I kind of had
to force myself to focus on hitting
my walls, going underwater, hit-
ting my breakouts. As the meet
progressed, my mindset changed
a little bit, allowing me to turn in
some swims that were respectable,
especially for not being rested or
completely healthy."
Bottom also praised senior
co-captain Andre Schultz for his
"stud" performances and team
leadership throughout the week-
end.
The So Paulo, Brazil native
was the national runner-up in
the 200- and 400-yard individual
medleys and swam on three relays.
Because he is not a United States
citizen, Schultz was not allowed to
score points for Michigan, since it
was a national championship swim
meet. Senior Alon Mandel and
freshmen Iassaan Abdel Khalik
and Miguel Ortiz were not permit-
ted to win points for the Wolver-
ines, either, for the same reason.
Michigan alum Peter
Vanderkaay (2003-06), who still
trains in Ann Arbor withclub Wol-
verine, joined his former team-
mates at the meet. He won the
200-, 500- and 1,650-yard free-

style events.
After the Short Course National
Championships ended on Satur-
day, Michigan won three events
Sunday in the morning session
of the Long Course Invitational,
held at the same facility. Each
event was swam in a 50-meter pool
instead of a 25-meter pool.
Senior co-captain Chris Brady
.won the 100-meter butterfly and
Clary added one more victory to
his r6sum6 in the 100-meter back-
stroke.
The Wolverines also swept the
top three spots in the 400-meter
freestyle, with senior Charlie
Houchin touching first, Madwed
second and Feeley third.
Junior Neal Kennedy, who
is becoming the team's premier
breaststroker, placed fifth in the
100-meter breaststroke at the
Long Course Invitational and
also finished 20th in the 100-yard
breaststroke at the Short Course
National Championships. Bot-
tom, who has been impressed with
Kennedy's performances in the
last few meets, called his swim-
ming this weekend a "pleasant
surprise."
The two meets last weekend
marked the final times Michigan
will compete this month. The
Wolverines will train in the Flor-
ida Keys over the holiday break
and will race again on Jan. 2 in the
Orange Bowl Classic.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY TOP 10 POLL
Each week, Daily Sports staffers will fill out ballots, with first place votes
receiving 10 points, second-place votes receiving nine, and so on.

Senior DeShawn Sims will be key tothe Wolverines' success this season.

Wolverines couldn't buya bucket.
So they dumped the ball in to
Sims and let him go to work down
low, and he put on a clinic against
the Golden Lion big men who
couldn't keep up with his speed.
With the threat of Sims in the
post, the defenders were forced to
stay behind on him and not follow
Michigan's shooters all the way
out to the 3-point line. This led to
more open looks, which the Wol-
verines took advantage of - the
second half of the game was the
first time in three games the team
cracked 30 percent from beyond
the arc.
The defenders staying home on
Sims also opened up opportuni-
ties for Harris, who scored 16 of
his 18 points in the second half.
But most importantly, this win
more than any other proved that
while Harris is the biggest name
on the team and certainly a great

player, Michigan goes as Sims
goes. It may sound like blasphemy
to the Manny Fresh worshipers,
but the numbers back it up.
In Michigan's two worst losses,
against Marquette and Boston
College, Manny Harris had 22
points and 19 points, respectively.
Sims? Eight and four.
In the only game that could
even remotely be considered a
signature win for the Wolverines,
Sims notched a double-double,
with 16 points and 11 rebounds.
The point is, while Manny
Harris is the best player on the
team, DeShawn Sims is the most
valuable.
And as Saturday's game proved,
the only way for Michigan to get
the numbers it needs from its
most valuable player on a regular
basis is to feed him in the post.
Only then will Michigan con-
sistently win.

1. ALABAMA: The Tide's Heisman
hopeful, RB Mark Ingram, is
from Flint. Hmm, wonder how he
slipped away from the Wolverines.

2. TEXAS: The Big 12
Championship was excruciating.
Good luck at the Downtown
Athletic Club after that one, Colt.

3. CINCINNATI: Brian Kelly might
be the best offensive mind in the
game right now. Too bad he takes
a nap whenever Cincy's on 'D.'
4. TCU: The Horned Frogs are one
of the nation's best-coached teams.
How do you think they'd match
up with a stalwart like Alabama?
5. BOISE STATE: The only thing
more exciting than the Bronco
offense is the bright blue turf on
which they play home games.

6. FLORIDA: Did anyone else see
Tebowbawling after the game?
Was that because of the loss or
the beating he took from'Bama?
7. OREGON: What a roller coaster of
a season - from the Blount Blow to
a Rose Bowl berth after besting the
Beavers. Beat the Buckeyes, Ducks.
8. GEORGIA TECH: The Yellow
Jackets have a BCS bowl berth
in year two under Paul Johnson.
Take notes, Rich Rodriguez.
9. IOWA: The Hawkeyes slipped
into the BCS this year. Unbelievable,
after aone-point win over Northern
Iowa to start the season.
10. VIRGINIA TECH: Hokie,
Hokie, Hi, Hi, Tech, Tech, VPI!
A down year in Blacksburg is
not making the BCS. Oh, well.
