UEC to consider
revisions to code

After lengthy
hearings, Parikh
declared next CSG
president
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
In the wake of a series of
lengthy hearings in relation to
last week's controversial Central
Student Government presidential
election, members of the Univer-
sity Elections Commission called
for a review of the election code

to prevent similar occurrences in
the future.
The five-person commit-
tee voted 3-2 to issue only four
demerits to recently elected CSG
President and Business junior
Manish Parikh, just one short
of the five demerits that consti-
tute disqualification. The deci-
sion came following a marathon
hearing, which began Thursday
at 7:30 p.m. and ended on Friday
at 7 a.m.
The hearing proved crucial
in determining the eligibility of
Parikh after the election results
were tabulated and showed he
had won.

Parikh, and his running mate
LSA sophomore Omar Hashwi,
garnered 31.54 percent of the
vote. YouMICH candidates Busi-
ness junior Shreya Singh and LSA
junior Ethan Hahn finished sec-
ond with 29.7 percent of the vote.
The MForward and OurMichi-
gan candidates finished a distant
third and fourth.
Election director Peter Borock
wrote the commission's opinion
from the hearing and voiced his
thoughts of the election code.

ment Compiled Code article on

15th annualM
raises over $500,000

Money raised at
Dance Marathon
to aid local
children
By YOUNJOO SANG and
EMILY KASTL
Daily Staff Reporters
As 1,000 weary partici-
pants completed 30 hours of
non-stop dancing at the 15th
annual Dance Marathon at
the University of Michigan
this weekend, they found sol-
ace in knowing that they had
cumulatively helped raise a

record-breaking $510,325.76
for pediatric therapy.
To commemorate 15 years
on campus, DMUM gave more
than $500,000 to North Star
Reach - a camp in Pinckney,
Mich. that provides free year-
round camping opportunities
for children with illnesses
- and formally presented a
check to the organization at
the marathon's closing cer-
emony yesterday at the Indoor
Track Building.
In an interview before the
event, LSA senior Amanda
Koons, DMUM community
outreach chair, said the orga-
nization sought to expand
their proceeds to areas

beyond just the University of
Michigan Health System.
"It's our 15th year, and we
were looking for a way to fur-
ther our cause, not only at our
two hospitals, but in the sur-
rounding community," Koons
said. "We thought this was a
good way to expand our reach
into the community."
The more than half-million
dollars raised this year will
support non-traditional ther-
apies for children with cere-
bral palsy, hearing loss and
autism.

Journalist shares
difficulties of
engaging the public
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffRepoter
When the Deepwater Hori-
zon exploded in April 2010,
spewing into the Gulf of Mex-
ico, one journalist sought to
investigate beyond the surface
to uncover the hidden enor-
mity of the disaster.
At the 125th anniversary
celebration of the Environ-
mental Health Sciences
Department on Friday, Rich-
ard Harris, a science reporter
for National Public Radio,
discussed his experiences as
a reporter in the field. Dur-
ing his keynote address at the
event, hosted by the School of
Public Health, Harris shared
his account of covering the
Gulf oil spill of 2010 and
uncovering the extent of the
oil leakage from the Deepwa-
ter Horizon pipe.
In an interview after the
speech, Harris said his expe-
rience working with a team of
scientists that discovered the
oil spill was more severe than
initially reported, inspired his
desire to continue to pursue
environmental journalism.

"I found some scientists
that could analyze the flow
(from a video of the oil leak-
age) and they realized there
was as much as 10 times the
oil coming out of there as
the official estimate," Harris
said. "The government had to
change the estimate of how
much oil was coming out, and
BP was in a position of figur-
ing outa different way of cop-
ing with this volume of oil. It
was one of those times you
think, 'I can make a difference
as a reporter."'
Harris - who has severed
as a science reporter for NPR
for 26 years and broadcasts
on the "Morning Edition,"
"All Things Considered" and
"Weekend Edition" programs
- covered the United Nations
climate negotiations in
December, the Gulf of Mexico
oil spill and was a contributor
to the NPR award winning
series, "Climate Connections,"
which addresses the various
aspects of climate change and
how it is changing the world.
Harris discussed the diffi-
culties in communicating the
realities of science to the pub-
lic, particularly in the areas
of global warming and radia-
tion, where news consumers
are often skeptical. He said

Leaders of Greek Life
hesitant to merge

MSU Police investigate freshman's death

Michigan State University
Police are investigating the
death of Olivia Pryor, an MSU
freshman who was found unre-
sponsive in her dorm room last
Monday the State News reported
last Tuesday.
Quishanna Coleman, Pryor's
roommate, who is also a fresh-
man, discovered Pryor's body
last Monday morning. MSU
Police told The State News that
autopsy results have not yet been
released, but alcohol poisoning
may have played a factor in the
18-year-old's death.
Stratton Lee, an undergradu-
ate adviser for the College of
Communication Arts and Sci-
ences, told The State News that

Pryor was a hard-working, pas-
sionate student, who planned on
pursuing journalism studies.
Princeton bans freshmen
from going Greek
Starting this fall, freshmen
at Princeton University will be
banned from rushing or other-
wise affiliating themselves with
fraternities or sororities. The
Daily Princetonian reported yes-
terday.
A report from the Univer-
sity's Greek Life Implementa-
tion Committee recommended
to University President Shirley
Tilghman that freshmen be
banned from attending formal

and semiformal events held by
Princeton's fraternities or soror-
ities. The report also suggested
punishment against upperclass-
men that organize Greek events,
and recommends that any stu-
dent who violates the ban be sus-
pended from the university, the
Princetonian reported.
According to the Princeton-
ian, the University disapproves
of Greek life on campus and
does not recognize fraterni-
ties or sororities as valid stu-
dent groups. The university has
threatened a complete ban on
Greek life if students don't com-
ply with the new rules.

containing a number of incoher-
ent, ambiguous, contradictory and
absurd provisions," Borock wrote
in the opinion's first sentence.
Thursday's hearing was con-
vened to discuss an e-mail sent
in support of Parikh to numerous
e-mail listservs. Back-up election
director Elson Liu said the e-mail
reached several hundreds of stu-
dents, a concerning number for a
race that was only decided by 146
votes.
"We're talking at least 800 stu-
dents (who received the e-mail),"
Liu said.
Liu said the commission ulti-
mately decided not to issue Parikh
enough demerits to disqualify
him from the election because
the connection between Parikh

and Social Work student Victor
Andrews, the president of the
School of Social Work and the stu-
dent who sent the e-mail, was dif-
ficult to determine.
"We weren't able to establish
beyond a reasonable doubt that
Manish knew that Victor was
goingto e-mail lists otherthan the
ones of the School of Social Work,"
Liu said.
Liu, who wrote a dissenting
opinion in the 3-2 decision, said he
considered the decision to be an
egregious error.
"Even on that alone, that's a
pretty serious breach of the elec-
tion rules when you reach an audi-
ence of hundreds of students and
you break the election rules to do
so," Liu said. "That's most of the
basis of my dissent."
Borock said the commission
received a total of 17 complaints,
which he added might be the most

it has ever received.
"This is my first time sitting on
the University Elections Commis-
sion, but I would imagine that's
the most they've ever heard or
quite close to it," Borock said.
Borock said the lengthy pro-
cess was more indicative of faults
in the election code, rather than
immoral campaigning tactics.
"I think this was a really clean
election actually," Borock said. "I
think it speaks to the fact that the
election code is really poorly writ-
ten."
He added that most demer-
its were issued for minor affairs,
like poor attendance at mandated
meetings.
"The vast majority of demer-
its issued were because people
missed their meetings," Borock
said. "It's incredibly clean ... stu-
dents at the University of Michi-
gan have a lot to look forward to in

greatleadership next year."
Borock said he did not antici-
pate the hours that being election
director would entail, noting that
in the past month he said he has
worked 115 hours on the elections,
after being told it would only be
about 20 hours.
Borock provided examples of
some of the less practical rules the
election code contains, including
strict regulations on party names.
"One of the absurdities of the
election code is ... the first letter of
each word has to be capitalized,"
Borock said.
Under those circumstances,
youMICH, OurMichigan and
MForward are breaking election
code, Borock noted. However,
Students for Puppies did not break
this rule.
"So technically, if a case was
brought up, we would have to
give violations and demerits for

that which would just be absurd.
It would just be absurd," Borock
said.
Still, the seemingly never-end-
ing case that spanned Thursday
night until Friday might not be
over yet.
LSA senior Katy Tylus, the you-
MICH campaign manager, said
youMICH will be appealing the
case to the Central Student Judi-
ciary, the judicial branch of CSG.
Law student Betsy Fisher acted
as counsel for Parikh, and said she
and Parikh also plan to appeal the
decision, as a reaction to the you-
MICH appeal.
"We're only appealing because
we anticipate that the other
side will appeal," Fisher said.
"If they're going to argue that
(Parikh) should get more demer-
its we need to make a counterar-
gument."
Law student Ryan Gersovitz,

the CSG chief justice, said he has
not received any formal appeals
yet. According to Gersovitz, the
average time - which is subject
to change - for CSG to hear an
appeal is a week and a half, add-
ing that CSG could remand the
case back to the UEC, which was
supposed to have held its last
meeting yesterday.
In response to the problems
in the election code, Business
senior Matt Eral, a member of
the UEC and the speaker of the
assembly, said he plans to intro-
duce a resolution to ensure last
week's incidents never happens
again.
"The title is 'a resolution
amending the compiled code to
strike the election code in its
entirety,"' Eral said. "It's going
to be sponsored by every mem-
ber of the University Elections
Commission."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Parade to rid
Detroit of evil spell
Detroit is nearly broke. Its
mayor is recovering from sur-
gery. Seems like a good time for
a parade to try to chase away an
evil spirit.
More than 3,000 people turned
out yesterday for a third annual
parade intended to rid Detroit of
a spell cast by a red dwarf who
was struck by a cane by a famous
pioneer centuries ago, Antoine
Cadillac. Or so the story goes.
The dress code was costumes.
The Detroit News says a subur-
ban woman attended the parade
with her sheepdog dressed in a
tutu. Shari Lombardo says any-
thing "new and different" is good
for Detroit. A man dressed as the
feared red dwarf taunted spec-
tators by declaring, "I own this
town."
LONGMONT, Colo.
Two people killed
in midair crash
A pilot whose plane crashed -
possibly after a midair collision
with another aircraft - was con-
scious when people ripped off the
door of her Cessna 180 to pull her
to safety, but authorities said two
people in the other plane were
killed.
The crashes of the single-
engine planes north of Denver
Friday - reported about five min-
utes and six miles apart - are
being investigated as a possible
midair collision, Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Mike
Fergus said.
The two people who died
appeared to be males and were
believed to be an instructor pilot
and a student in a Cessna 172 that
crashed about a half mile from a
Walmart southeast of Longmont.
The survivor crashed within
sight of the Vance Brand Airport
runway in Longmont after clip-
ping four overhead power lines.
The clipped lines caused 132
customers to temporarily lose
power.
SEOUL, South Korea
Media denied
entrance to Obama
meeting in Seoul
When President Barack Obama
arrived at the presidential palace
in Seoul yesterday, he was missing
his constant traveling compan-
ions: members of the U.S. press
corps traveling in Obama's motor-
cade.
In an embarrassing bilateral
blockade, members of the media
were denied entrance to the Blue
House. The messy scene resulted
in their missing Obama's meeting
with South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak.
At first, the media were held
inside an entrance to the build-
ing as security scrambled to lock

the doors around them. When
that didn't work, they walked up
a street and were met by security
guards brandishing batons.
No reason for the mix-up was
ever provided.
CAIRO
Teenager killed, 68
injured as police
clash with fans
Egyptian soldiers clashed with
thousands of angry soccer fans in
a Mediterranean coastal city over
the suspension of their club fol-
lowing a deadly riot last month,
witnesses said Saturday. A medi-
cal official said a teenager was
killed and 68 people injured.
The Feb. 1 melee following a
match in the city of Port Said in
which at least 73 people died was
the world's worst soccer-related
disaster in 15 years. The causes
remain murky.
In the latest clashes, Egyptian
troops fired volleys of tear gas
and shot into in the air to disperse
protesters affiliated with Port
Said's Al-Masry club.

under the current system.
LSA junior Kinnard Hocken-
hull, president of the Psi Upsi-
lon fraternity, which is an IFC
chapter, is largely responsible for
spearheading the campaign. He
said the University's Greek com-
munity is unnecessarily divided.
"It's really not one communi-
ty," Hockenhull said. "On a very
basic level, one of the goals we
had was to start a conversation
about the nature of our commu-
nity."
Beyond increased interaction
among the executive boards of
the four councils, Hockenhull
said he would like to see more
communication among members
of Greek community in general.
"I think it's odd that we con-
sider ourselves to be one com-
munity, but we never have all the
(presidents) of this community
come together in the same room,
sit across the table and have a
conversation," Hockenhull said.
Engineering junior Emily
Desanti, president of the Pan-
hellenic Assocation, released a
statement to The Michigan Daily
yesterday on behalf of the presi-
dents of all four councils regard-
ing the campaign, expressing
that they are currently unsure of
the effort's plans and are inter-
ested to see what it has to offer.
"At the moment, the inten-
tions of the Unified Greek
Council are not clear to us," the
statement said. "Increased cohe-
siveness between the four coun-
cils is a goal we all share and we
look forward to meeting with
the leaders of this campaign in

order to learn more about what
inspired their movement, what
they want to achieve, how they
plan on carryingoutthis endeav-
or, and if there is anything that
our councils could do to assist
them."
Still, in an e-mail to Panhel-
lenic Association sorority presi-
dents on March 15, DeSanti
warned Greek leadership against
having Hockenhull speak with
sorority members, noting that
due to their membership within
the National Panhellenic Con-
ference, they are unable to break
away from the organization.
"Some of you may have
received an e-mail from Kinnard
Hockenhull, the president of Psi
Upsilon about his platform to
unify the four Greek councils,"
she wrote. "I would strongly
advise against allowing him to
speak to your chapters."
Despite the dissension, Hock-
enhull said he feels the Greek
community could have great
potential if the four councils col-
laborated more frequently.
"At Michigan, we have great
diversity, but it's sort of locked
up in these camps," he said.
"There's incredible potential
when you release it and allow
people to connect, free of these
barriers."
According to Hockenhull,
the campaign's meetings have
included discussions about the
history of the Greek communi-
ty, analysis of the system's cur-
rent structure and the leaders'
visions for the community in the
future. He added that last week,
individuals began to take lead-
ing roles as they worked toward
composing an actual plan.
Hockenhull said conversa-

tions about the past and future
are key in order to achieve an
understanding of what the cam-
paign envisions for the Greek
community.
"It's not something that any
one person in power can imple-
ment," he said. "It's not really
about whether a few kids get
together and have meetings
every few months. It's really
about 'are we really connecting
to each other as a community?"
Hockenhull said he is happy
with the response the campaign
has received and the quality of
ideas, noting that attendance at
the meetings hasn't been reflec-
tive of the widespread response
to the initiative.
"I think the response has been
very good and broad, which,
I think, is the most important
thing, and it has been from a lot
of different parts of the commu-
nity, beyond Greek Life as well,"
Hockenhull said. "I think this
is a natural progression and a
positive progression."
Though the campaign lead-
ers have not presented any offi-
cial proposals to the executive
members of the four councils,
they are planning to meet with
the presidents soon, Hockenhull
said.
LSA sophomore Sara Berke
- a member of the Chi Omega
sorority, which is a part of the
Panhellenic Association - said
she was contacted by Hocken-
hull to help spread the word
about the campaign.
"We're not asking organiza-
tions to leave their councils;
that's not what we're trying to
do at all," Berke said. "We just
want there to be a community
sense between the councils."

able to benefit from DMUM.
In an e-mail interview, Alex's
mom, Dawn Ham-Kucharski,
explained how DMUM played
a pivotal role in helping Alex
grow.
"The opportunity for rec-
reational and social activities
has given him confidence and
pride," Ham-Kucharski wrote.
"The funds raised for (Physical
Medicine and Rehabilitation)
have given him a voice, strong
muscles - an opportunity to
thrive."
Among therapy services pro-
vided by the organization, tree
climbing, dance, cheerleading
and Dreams and Wings - a pro-
gram that allows children to co-
pilot an airplane - are the most
popular.
"(The therapies) try to help
kids who have disabilities have
those experiences that all other
kids get to have," Koons wrote.
This year's theme was games,
and dancers partook in a vari-
ety of gaming activities to take
their mind of their sore legs.
However, LSA senior Amanda
Remer said the children were
what keep her motivated dur-
ing the marathon.
"I think about what these
kids go through on a daily basis,
and I realize I can do it," she
said. "If they go through it their
whole lives, I can stand for 30
hours."
DMUM began in 1997 and
initially partnered with the
Children's Miracle Network
to donate to Beaumont Hos-
pital in Royal Oak. As stu-
dent involvement increased
and subsequently boosted the
organization's fundraising
ability, DMUM began partner-
ing with C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital in 2000, splitting its
funds between the two hospi-
tals. DMUM later moved to the
Indoor Track Building from the
Sports Coliseum to accommo-
date for increasing participa-
tion in the organization.
Nancy Forster, whose family
has been involved with DMUM
for seven years, explained she
is impressed each year by the
growing amount of student par-
ticipation.
"To take time out of their
lives and busy schedules to do
this and get nothing tangible in
return. It shows that there is so
much love and kindness in peo-

ple. It warms my heart," Forster
wrote in an e-mail interview.
The Cox family, who attend-
ed the marathon for the first
time this year, said they enjoyed
themselves and Suzanne Cox
added she was glad that her son,
Byron, had a chance to "come
out of the shell."
"We told the (dancing team)
that we're proud of them," Cox
said.
Before the marathon, Ohio
State University students
uploaded a YouTube video
titled, "Bring it," challenging
DMUM to a fundraising battle
against their dance marathon
program. According to Koons,
OSU raised $450,000 during
their marathon this year, and
it was monumental for the Uni-
versity to beat them at more
than $500,000.
"This was a record-breaking
year," Koons said. "This was the
first year that we have exceed-
ed $500,000, and it's our 15th
anniversary on campus, so it
was really powerful for every-
one."
During the marathon, dance
captains for each team had the
duty of keeping the dancers
moving and motivated to help
them pull through 30 hours of
dancing.
LSA senior Amanda Popiela,
one of the dance captains, said
her goal was to help the dancers
stay energized, assist with fun-
draising and ensure the dancers
had a good time.
"We say motivating mes-
sages, and I also remember why
I am here," Popiela said. "I am
here for the kids and I make
sure that (the dancers) remem-
ber the message too."
As a graduating senior and
fourth-time DMUM partici-
pant, Popiela said it felt great to
see the success of DMUM.
"We raised a record-break-
ing amount of money, which is
really great, and I think we had
a lot of energy," she said.
Though the dancers were
on their feet for 30 hours,
LSA senior Megan Richards
explained that the overall expe-
rience is more rewarding than
tiring.
"After the marathon is over,
you don't remember your feet
hurting, you remember.all the
smiles on the kids' faces," Rich-
ards said. "(After the last sec-
ond countdown), it's a combo of
relief, amazement and an over-
whelming sense of accomplish-
ment."

Research, the Office of Research
and Sponsored Programs and the
Office of Technology Transfer to
propel the policy change.
Weinert said once the policy
has been fully implemented,
the University will benefit from
enhanced research opportunities
with corporate partners.
"Most of our graduates will
end up with careers in industry,
and greater exposure to chal-
lenges identified by the business
community helps to inform the
research conducted on campus
and to improve our educational
programs," Weinert said.

Weinert added that the busi-
ness partners will benefit from
the philosophical shift in the
policy.
"For the businesses, they now
can enter into partnerships on
campus with a greater under-
standing of the overall contrac-
tual relationship," Weinert said.
"Rather than entering into a
research contract and then nego-
tiating again to secure rights to
any intellectual property that
may have resulted from the fund-
ed research, they now can negoti-
ate both aspects of the contract at
once, as they enter into the rela-
tionship."
Weinert pointed out that the
new policy has garnered positive
feedback from both companies

and the research community on
campus, and he predicts that few
researchers will choose to opt out
of the policy.
"We recognized that a new
approach was necessary to
unlock the potential for produc-
tive research partnerships with
business," Weinert said.
The Ann Arbor area and the
state of Michigan, will benefit
from the developing economic
activity - a result of the Univer-
sity's growing entrepreneurial
culture, Weinert said.
"Business and academia are
critical pillars of our society and
it is imperative that we recognize
and develop mechanisms for us
to productively work together,"
Weinert said.

difficult because of the polarizing
nature of science and the public.
In his address, Harris
explained that public opinion
is often difficult to sway when
Americans are concerned with
other areas beyond environmen-
tal affairs. However, Harris said a
major turning point for the public
occurred was implementation of
the Waxman-Markey bill - legis-
lation advocating for energy effi-
ciency, passed in the U.S. House
of Representatives in May 2009.
Harris discussed in a May 22,
2009 NPR broadcast how the new
bill was a stepping stone toward
creating a law that limits green-
house gas emissions.

Harris referred to those who
do not believe in global warming
as "deniers," noting that many of
them speak out against the sci-
ence of climate change because of
pressuresfromtheirsocialcircles.
"It's importantto see how peo-
ple reach their conclusion, but not
to say they are irrational," Harris
said. "This puts us into the politi-
cal dialogue ... We all need to work
together to solvethis problem."
Harris explained how science
stories can often be misinformed
or misinterpreted, noting that
one of the biggest uncertainties in
reporting in recent years has been
on health risks of radiation.
"Reporting about radiation
is always filled with trepidation
because people have no proof of
how dangerous radiation is," Har-
ris said. "It is too hard to measure;

if there is a risk, it is too small to
measure."
After a series of nuclear melt-
downs at the Fukushima Dai-ichi
power plant last March, which
were triggered by the tsunami
that struck Japan, Harris inter-
viewedscientistsfromthe Natural
Resources Defense Council and
the National Academy of Sciences
about the effects of radiation from
the Fukushima cloud. Harris said
data revealed that there was only
an excess of 100 cancer instances ,
in a population of two million,
which downplayed the radiation
danger perceived by the public.
"If the cancer incident rate in
Japan is 40 percent, and what
they are talking about is a 100th
of a percent increase going from
40 percent to 40.01percent, what
health physicists were saying

was that this is too small to mea-
sure and justify," Harris said.
Public Health student Lindsay
Ward wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that she met Harris before
his speech during a workshop
for students interested in science
journalism, and noted that Har-
ris offeredvaluableknowledge for
students interested in his field.
"We talked about things like
pressure from outside influences
like industry and policy mak-

ers," Ward wrote. "He also talked
about how, in careers like jour-
nalism where independence and
ambition determine a lot of what
is possible in a given individual's
career, flexibility and curiosity
are invaluable strengths."
Ward added she was particu-
larly interested with the ways
in which Harris interacted with
scientists, and the difficulties of
translating interviews into stories
the public can understand.

Use intelligent dialogue, not accusatory rhetoric
tudent government elections had a greater than usual pres-
ence on campus during this year's Central Student Gov-
ernment campaign cycle. From chalking on the Diag and
supporters donning party t-shirts to Facebook events and debates,
the numerous candidates' campaigns left few stones unturned. In
the midst of these elections, an accusatory e-mail targeting one can-
didate went viral after circulating among the Greek community for
several days. An e-mail sent out to multiple sororities on campus
accused LSA sophomore Omar Hashwi, now vice president-elect of
CSG, of being anti-Semitic and homophobic. Some of these accusa-
tions were baseless and inflammatory. In the Internet age, informa-
tion travels at lightning speed, and as a result words and accusations
carry great weight. Dialogue is always more beneficial than one-sid-
ed arguments, where untruthful and defamatory statements can be
disguised as fact and seriously damage a person's reputation.

This week in news...

T he University was put
on high alert last Thurs-
day when a "suspicious
animal," possibly a cougar, was
reportedly seen
roaming North
Campus. And no,
I'm not talking
about a middle-
aged woman
hoping to meet
a nice Engineer-
ing student. (Bet DANIEL
you hadn't heard CHARDELL
that one before.)
The alleged
cougar sighting may have captured
the attention of students for a few
hours, but it wasn't the most ridicu-
lous piece of news to make waves
this week. Here are some other sto-
ries that, like Cougargate, caught
my attention for their sheer absur-
dity. Except, for better or for worse,
these stories actually matter.
1. The true cause of Trayvon
Martin's death? According to Fox
News' Geraldo Rivera, the 17-year-
old's hoodie. Of course. Because
when you see a "dark-skinned kid
walking down the street," shooting
to kill is simply a "reflexive action."
We all know that murder is bad.
But murdering someone wearing a
hoodie? Well, Rivera seems to think
that's a reasonable thingto do. Rive-
ra has received considerable back-
lash for his insensitive statements,
and rightly so. There's a way to talk
about stereotypes and their deadly
consequences with integrity. And
then there's Rivera's tactic: blame
the victim of those stereotypes,
thereby reinforcing them.

2. The newest star in the Repub-
lican presidential primaries? The
Etch A Sketch. On Wednesday,
senior Romney adviser Eric Fehrn-
strom said he wasn't worried that
Romney's extremist rhetoric would
alienate moderate voters come
November.
"It's almost like an Etch A
Sketch," he said on CNN. "You can
kind of shake it up, and we start all
over again."
Pouncing on the opportunity to
discredit Romney's claim to conser-
vatism, Rick Santorum and Newt
Gingrich made the Etch A Sketch a
centerpiece in their public appear-
ances over the next couple days.
Both candidates could be found
holding up the toy as they con-
demned the "inevitable" candidate's
inevitable flip-flop. I enjoy picturing
the interns who were sent on a wild
goose chase to track down an Etch A
Sketch - almost as much as I enjoy
Santorum and Gingrich's attempts
to brandish the Etch A Sketch casu-
ally in the middle of their speeches,
as if they just happened to have one
on hand. That's a political gimmick
at its finest. Who would've thought
that the decades-old toy would be
making headlines in the 2012 race
for the White House? Call me crazy,
but I'd say the Etch A Sketch is this
year's most surprising comeback in
national politics.
3. Who's getting a new lease on
life? Dick Cheney. The former vice
president received a heart trans-
plant on Saturday. Still no word on
whether Cheney's new heart will
make him a decent human being or,
given the series of car bombingsthat

devastated Iraq last Tuesday, any
more capable of expressing shame
and regret for the futile war he
helped to manufacture. The attacks
marked the ninth anniversaryofthe
2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Appar-
ently, violence lingers even after
war officially ends. Who would have
guessed that? Back in October, for-
mer presidential candidate Michele
Bachmann argued that "Iraq should
reimburse the United States fully for
the amount of money we've spent to
liberate these people." Aside from
the backwardness of her morals, I
wonder if Bachmann still subscribes
tothis pay-per-liberationlogic. Now
that Cheney has a heart, maybe he'll
convince Bachmann and her fellow
Republican presidential nominees
to do some soul-searching of their
own. Or maybe she'll just get the
Iraqis to reimburse Cheney for his
surgery.
The North
Campus cougar
and other stories.
A heart transplant, an Etch A
Sketch and a hoodie. It sounds like
the beginning of a bad joke.
Worse: it's a recipe for bad news,
bad politics and bad people.

Last Tuesday, an e-mail began circulating
in the University's Greek community claim-
ing that Hashwi was an anti-Semite and a
homophobe. The e-mail urged students not
to vote for Hashwi, citing fear of what he
could do in a leadership position. The e-mail
was forwarded to many other members of
the Greek community. Leibach cited Hash-
wi's behavior at CSG meetings as proof of his
anti-Semitism. She claimed that Hashwi had
repeatedly voted to allow an individual who
vehemently portrayed anti-Israel views to
have more than the allotted three minutes to
speak at meetings. Hashwi and his running
mate, Business junior Manish Parikh, repeat-
edly asserted their support of the Jewish and
gay communities.
Beyond the initial sendingof the e-mail,
it's discouraging that students receiving it
didn't read more critically. It's also disap-
pointing these claims were forwarded quickly
and extensively. In a time when the Internet
allows people to spread information rapidly,
it's more than necessary to pay attention to
what you send. The accusations made against
Hashwi were supported by little evidence -
reading the entirety of the e-mail made that
clear. It's important not only to filter this type
of rhetoric, but also to separate rumor from
fact. Instead of being forwarded, the e-mail
should have been condemned. Small commu-
nities on campus can create an echo chamber,
turning rumors into fact.
It may be cliche, but the University's
"Expect Respect" motto sets an appropriate
goal for campus dialogue. Students should

foster an atmosphere deserving of the leaders
and best by giving the respect they'd expect
from others. Hashwi was a candidate run-
ning for office, putting himself ina position to
be criticized. Criticism, however,-is separate
from hearsay and rumors. Any potentially
valid critiques of Hashwi's policy positions
were invalidated by the strong rhetoric. Espe-
cially since it was broadcast to a large campus
community, the e-mail was unprofessional
and petty. When this type of sensationalized
rhetoric is passed around as fact, it's essential
that students speak out against it. Emotional-
ly-charged and politicized claims pit students
against each other and divide our campus.
Listening to someone's perspective doesn't
mean you support his or her views. The-fact
that Hashwi allowed someone to engage in
free speech is in no way grounds for the accu-
sation that he believes those views. When
dealing with controversial topics - be it the
Iraq War, the Arab/Israeli conflict or abortion
- it's necessary to have open dialogue with
all perspectives represented. People can and
should advocate their viewpoints, backed up
with evidence, and hearing other perspectives
is a benefit to all. Attacking people like Hash-
wi for simply listening to another individual's
opinion makes it impossible to have produc-
tive and insightful conversations about highly
divisive topics.
The campus environment is what we, as
students, make it. If we want an environ-
ment where people feel safe and comfortable
expressing their views, it's important to pro-
mote dialogue based in fact.

JESSE KLEIN W
Clicking'delete' on memories

It was inevitable that everyone on campus would
forget St. Patrick's Day, but most of us would have paid
to forget the morning after. According to an article in
the March issue Wired magazine, the time where this
is possible is within reach: "In the near future the act
of remembering will be a choice."
Scientist Karim Nadar conditioned a group of rats
to fear a sound by electrically shocking them. After
reinforcing their fear for several weeks, Nadar inject-
ed the rats with a protein synthesis blocker just as he
played the noise. Suddenly the fear was gone. The rats
forgot the memory of the shocks associated with the
noise. Nadar proved memory reconsolidation. Memo-
ries are not videos or pictures in the mind, static and
never changing. They are chemically and electrically
recreated every time they are remembered. Timing is
everything - "to get people to forget something. just
ask them to remember it."
If memories are recreated with the act of remember-
ing, the highly sought after eyewitness account in the
justice system might be worth nothing more than awork
of fiction. Witness recounts of illegal activity are the
most persuasive to juries and cause the most unanimous
convictions. But according to Nadar's research, these
shouldn't be trusted. The witness isn't lying, rather cre-
ating a memory where the events have been indoctri-
nated with their own emotions,justifications and biases,
without their knowledge or conscious consent. But
while the discovery reveals cracks in the justice system
it is working to fill them in the medical field.
Nader's research is a huge step for the cure and
treatment of PTSD, a disease of memory. People who
have experienced a traumatic event are haunted by the

memories they can't forget. But it's not the memories
that cause their stress, but the negative emotions that
are injected into the memory as it is being remem-
bered. In time scientists will. and should, be able to
erase the memories that are haunting PTSD patients.
Pain is a good teacher - didn't you decide to never
drink again after March 17? It's hard to argue with
this. The past is gone as soon as it happens and only
lives on through our memories. But as Nadar proved
with his research, those memories are not true repre-
sentations of reality.
Instead, our minds reconstruct them while insert-
ing false realities and emotions in the process. Our
memories are the basis for who we are. Without them
we would lose ourselves. Being able to delete certain
memories gives us unprecedented power over our
lives; past, present and future.
And this can be as dangerous as it could be helpful.
Imagine a dictator who could erase the memories of
his subjects, or an abusive parent, erasing memories of
the abusive relationships with his family. If the power
of wiping memories becomes commercial, we create a
society that allows the average person to delete every
bad or painful event in their lives. How will we as a
population learn and grow into better people if we
can't remember the times when we were at our worst?
With every passing year, it seems we get closer to
the science fiction advances of books and movies and
with each passing year we get closer to dystopias these
books warn against.

U.S. should support afreer Syria
TO THE DAILY:
March 21st was Mother's Day in the Middle East.
Normally, mothers and grandmothers would be busy
collecting gifts, cards and roses from family members.
This year was different. This year, the Syrian dicta-
tor murdered those women, ordered the rape of those
women, and ensured that this beautiful day turned
into a day of tragedy and mourning. Modest estimates
put the death toll in Syria at 11,000. Tens of thousands
more are being detained and tortured. Homes are
being destroyed. For what? What could possibly make
a dictator lash out in such an inhumane way? All of this
is because the people of Syria are asking for freedom,
democracy and just a little bit of dignity.
The world has failed to respond. In the United Nations,
Russia and China continue to veto any resolution that
does more than tell Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad that
he's doing something bad. President Barack Obama has
been dragging his feet, only to condemn Bashar al-Assad

in a few sound bites here and there. Words are no longer
enough. As humans, we have an ethical responsibility to
support each other. We should be encouraging humani-
tarian intervention in Syria. Something as basic as send-
ing medical equipment and food would go a long way in
a place where people are dying for lack of access to hos-
pitals.
It's also in our interest to gain an ally in the region
for diplomatic reasons. If we support Syria, Syria will
support us in our attempts to encourage security in the
area. Iran is only a border away. Israel is right around
the corner. Iraq is right next-door. Syrians would be
greatly appreciative of U.S. support in such a critical
time. They will not forget it. Just like we were on the
right side of history by liberating Jews in the concen-
tration camps of Hitler, we can be on the right side of
history again by encouraging the democratic move-
ment in Syria.

PARIS (AP) - A Frenchman
suspected of helping his broth-
er plot attacks against Jewish
schoolchildren and paratroop-
ers was handed preliminary
murder and terrorism charges
yesterday.
But Abdelkader Merah denied
any role in the attacks. Investiga-
tors looking into France's worst
terror attacks in years believe
Merah helped his brother
Mohamed prepare the killings,
and are investigating whether
they were linked to an interna-

worked on their own.
Abdelkader's lawyer said he
feels like "a scapegoat."
"No one knew anything"
about what Mohamed was
plotting, lawyer Anne-Sophie
Laguens told reporters in
Paris. She dismissed reports
that Abdelkader had praised
his brother's attacks. "He was
never proud of those actions."
Mohamed Merah, 23, claimed
responsibility for killing three
Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi
and three paratroopers ear-
lier this month. After a 32-hour
standoff with police, he died
Thursday in a hail of gunfire as
he jumped out a window of his
apartment in the southern city
of Toulouse.
Since then, attention has

focused on his older brother
Abdelkader Merah, who was
handed preliminary charges on
Sunday of complicity to murder
and theft, and involvement in a
terrorist enterprise, prosecu-
tors said. Detained last week, he
will remain in custody pending
further investigation.
Preliminary charges under
French law mean there is strong
reason to believe a crime was
committed, but allow magis-
trates more time to investigate.
Authorities suspect
Abdelkader had a role in acquir-
ing his younger brother's arse-
nal and financing his trips to
Afghanistan, Pakistan and the
Middle East. Mohamed Mersah
claimed allegiance to al-Qaida
and told police he traveled to
Afghanistan and Pakistan for
training.
The brother's girlfriend,
Yamina Mesbah, was held, then
released early Sunday without
being charged.
The girlfriend denied any
involvement in what happened
and said she was shocked bythe
killings, her lawyer Guy Debuis-
son said, adding that Abdelkad-
er Merah appeared to have led a
double life.
The couple married accord-
ing to Muslim custom in 2006,
but did not undergo the civil
ceremony required in France
for a marriage to be recognized.
Abdelkader Merah took five
or six long trips to Egypt, osten-
sibly to study Arabic literature,
and his girlfriend joined him on
two or three, the lawyer said.
During questioning by police,

the lawyer said, Mesbah learned
that Merah had had other moti-
vations for his trip to Egypt and
"a life that led him toward an
extremely intense ... fundamen-
talism."
"The question to ask today is
if Mohamed was the only one
that was indoctrinated. Was it
just him or are there others?"
Debuisson asked.
The first paratrooper killed,
Imad Ibn Ziaten, was buried
Sunday in his hometown in
Morocco on the Mediterra-
nean coast. Townspeople held
French and Moroccan flags as
soldiers carried the coffin to the
grave.
"It is incomprehensible, it
is unimaginable. Terrorism
doesn't understand this. And
above all we must not confuse
Islam and fanaticism. They
have .nothing to do with one
another," his brother Hatim Ibn
Ziaten said.
French State Secretary for
Defense Marc Laffineur accom-
panied the family to Morocco,
saying he wanted to show that
"France is in mourning." The
other paratroopers were bur-
ied in France last week, and the
Jewish children and rabbi were
buried in Israel.
The killings have affected
the race for French presiden-
tial elections in April and May,
and raised concerns of tensions
among France's large Muslim
and Jewish communities.
Thousands of people in Paris
and Toulouse marched silently
Sunday urging unity and toler-
ance of all religions and cul-

Court at center of
partisan debate
over Obama's
legislation
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
monumental fight over a health
care law that touches all Ameri-
cans and divides them sharply
comes before the Supreme Court
today. The justices will decide
whether to kill or keep the larg-
est expansion in the nation's
social safety net in more than
four decades.
If upheld, the law will force
dramatic changes in the way
insurance companies do busi-
ness, including forbidding them
from denying coverage due to
pre-existing medical conditions
and limiting how much they can
charge older people.
The law envisions that insur-
ers will be able to accommodate
older and sicker people without
facing financial ruin because of
its most disputed element, the
requirement that Americans
have insurance or pay a penalty.
Another major piece ofthelaw
is an expansion of the Medicaid
program for low-income Ameri-
cans that will provide coverage
to more than 15 million people

who currently earn too much to
qualify.
By 2019, about 95 percent of
the country will have health
insurance if the law is allowed
to take full effect, the Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates.
Republicans are leading the
fight to kill the law either bythe
court or through congressio-
nal repeal. They say the worst
fears about what they derisively
call "Obamacare" already have
come to pass in the form of
higher costs and regulations,
claims that the law's supporters
dispute. GOP presidential can-
didates all promise to repeal it
if elected.
"Obamacare has already prov-
en unpopular and unaffordable,"
House Speaker John, Boehner,
an Ohio Republican, said on the
law's second anniversary.
Polls have consistently
shown the public is at best
ambivalent about the benefits of
the health care law, and that a
majority of Americans believe
the insurance requirement is
unconstitutional.
The administration's public
education campaign has come
under strong criticism from its
allies who say the White House
has been timid in the face of
relentless Republican attacks.
Having rarely talked about

the lawsince he signed it, Obama
issued a brief statement Friday.
"The law has made a differ-
ence for millions of Americans,
and over time, it will help give
even more working and middle-
class families the security they
deserve."
The main event before the
court is tomorrow's argument
over the constitutionality of the
individual insurance require-
ment.
The court also will consider
whether the challenge is prema-
ture under a19th centurytax law
because the insurance require-
ment doesn't kick in until 2014
and people who remain unin-
sured wouldn't have to pay a
penalty until they file their 2014
income taxes in early 2015.
The case arrives at a high
court in which ideology and
political affiliation align for
the first time in generations.
The four Democratic appoin-
tees make up the liberal wing,
while the five justices named by
Republican presidents form a
cohesive conservative majority
on several key issues.
Despite calls for Thomas,
from liberal groups, and Justice
Elena Kagan, from conserva-
tives, to step aside, it appears all
the justices will take part in the
historic case.

Questions linger
on one-month
anniversary of
Martin' death
EATONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -
Wearing hooded sweatshirts
similar to the one that Trayvon
Martin wore on the night he was
killed, many preachers and wor-
shippers echoed calls for justice
yesterday in the shooting death
of an unarmed black teenager in
Florida last month.
The one-month anniversary of
Martin's death is today. He was
shot while wearing a "hoodie" as
he walked home on a rainy night
in a gated community. The neigh-
borhood watch volunteer who
shot him, 28-year-old George
Zimmerman, is the son of a white
father and Hispanic mother, and
the demands to charge him in
Martin's slaying have grown ever
louder. He had called police to
report the hooded figure as sus-
picious'tthe 17-year-old Martin
was carrying a bag of Skittles and
a can of iced tea, talking to his
girlfriend on his cellphone.
In African-American and
other religious centers from

Florida to Atlanta, New York
and Chicago, messages from pul-
pits couldn't help but touch on a
seemingly avoidable tragedy that
continues to be rife with more
questions than answers. But
while the call continued for the
arrest of Zimmerman, there were
also pleas to use the incident to
spark a larger movement.
"How do we turn pain into
power?" the Rev. Jesse Jack-
son asked a standing-room only
congregation of hundreds while
preaching at Macedonia Mission-
ary Baptist Church in Eatonville,
Fla., saout 20 miles from the site
of the Sanford shooting. "How do
we go from a moment to a move-
ment that curries favor?"
Jackson preached a sermon
entitled "The Substance of
Things Hoped For." He called
for Martin's "martyr" death to
be used as an opportunity to
revive the Civil Rights Com-
mission and draw attention to
long-standing issues. Very young
children and teens sat in the
choir behind him.
"The blood of the-innocent has
power," Jackson said to shouts of
"Amen" and loud clapping.
Jackson invoked the names
of Emmett Till, the 14-year-
old boy bludgeoned and shot to

death in Mississippi in 1955 for
supposedly whistling at a white
woman, and slain civil rights fig-
ures Medgar Evans and Martin
Luther King, Jr.
"There's power in the blood
of Emmett Till! There's power
in in the blood of Medgar Evers!
There's power in the blood of
Dr. King!" declared the 70-year-
old Jackson, who marched with
King.
Jackson made a direct plea to
change the "Stand Your Ground"
self-defense law that many
believe authorities in Florida
used to avoid arresting him.
Amid the outcry over the lack
of charges against Zimmerman,
the Sanford police chief and
state's attorney in the case have
both stepped aside. The U.S. Jus-
tice Department has opened a
civil rights probe into the shoot-
ing, and a grand jury is scheduled
to meet April 10 to consider evi-
dence in the case.
Zimmerman's attorney has
said he believes the case falls
under Florida's stand-your-
ground law, which dictates that a
person has the right to stand his
or her ground and "meet force
with force" if attacked. Attor-
ney Craig Sonner has said Zim-
merman is not a racist.

Citizens celebrate
Macky Sall's win
as fear of election
violence fades
DAKAR, Senegal (AP) - Pres-
ident Abdoulaye Wade conceded
defeat to his former protege
Macky Sall late yesterday, con-
gratulating him several hours
after polls closed when prelimi-
nary results showed the opposi-
tion candidate had trounced the
85-year-old incumbent.

Wade called Sall around 9:30
p.m. (2130 GMT) yesterday to
congratulate him on his victory,
state television reported. The
move alleviated fears that Wade
would attempt to stay in office
after 12 years or would challenge
the runoff results.
Even before Wade conceded,
Sall's supporters began celebrat-
ing in the streets of the capital,
singing and marching through
downtown Dakar. Some even
danced on the roofs of moving
vehicles, and one man did a cart-
wheel amid the traffic near the
Place de l'Independance.

Sociologist Hadiya Tandian
said that Wade's concession
washes away the wounds of a
violent election season, which
left at least six people dead and
tarnished the country's reputa-
tion.
"This is a great victory for
Senegal - it shows the maturity
of our democracy," Tandian said.
"It shows that the Senegalese
believe in their voter IDs, that
a voter card can change some-
thing, can make a difference. It
shows that our long democratic
heritage continues to live in us
day by day."
Senegal's democratic roots
run deep, and many feared
Wade would notcconcede defeat
and in the process muddy Sen-
egal's image as one of the only
established democracies in
western Africa.
Whereas most African
countries began holding elec-
tions post-independence in
the 1960s, the Senegalese first
cast their ballots 164 years ago
starting in 1848 when France
gave its territory the right to
elect a deputy to the French
parliament.
At a midnight press con-
ference at a Dakar hotel, Sall
offered few details on the con-
versation he had with Wade
earlier in the evening. Instead,
he praised the voters and said
he would be the president for
all Senegalese..
"Tonight, a new era begins
for Senegal," Sall told the
hundreds of journalists and
euphoric supporters who
crammed into the venue to
hear him speak.
There was no immediate
comment from Wade himself,
though his spokesman Seri-
gne Mbacke Ndiaye confirmed
the president's concession of
defeat.
"Senegal, through a trans-
parent election, just proved
once again that it remains a
great democracy, a great coun-
try," he said in a press release.
Wade first took office in
2000 after his predecessor con-
ceded in a historic moment for
Senegal. He easily won re-elec-
tion in 2007, but has seen his
popularity suffer amid soaring
costs of living and unemploy-
ment. When he cast his ballot
last month in the first round
of balloting, some voters even
booed him at the poll shouting:
"Old man, get lost."
His image also was tar-
nished after he began giving
an increasingshare of power to
his son Karim, who was deri-
sively called "the Minister of
the Sky and the Earth" after he
was handed control of multiple
ministries including infra-
structure and energy.

'Hunger Games' triumphs

Sts no secret that many
forms of fine art are strug-
gling to stay relevant in the
21st century.

returned to
its dusty box
in favor of more modern accesso-
ries. Directors fight to draw new
crowds as the advent of televi-
sion and film make the exclu-
sivity of theater performances
an inconvenience of the past.
Most musicals older than "Les
Misdrables" feel as if they've
been hermetically sealed in a
time we can no longer relate to.
As people are drawn away
from the artistic expressions
that captured the imaginations
of earlier decades and centuries,
a critical question must be asked:
Do the fine arts have the ability
to evolve alongside the audi-
ences that enjoy them? Or is the
art community forever set in its
ways?
Believe it or not, the answer
comes in the form of a little
Canadian entertainment com-
pany called Cirque du Soleil.
Cirque du Soleil, French for
"circus of the sun," is a collection
of touring and stationary shows
that are part circus, part opera
and part narrative-in-motion.
The company has been perform-
ing for just 28 years - infantile
when compared to ballet's
400-year-old pedigree - but
something about its artistic for-
mula has clicked with viewers.
What else would have already
drawn more than 100 mil-
lion people worldwide to their
shows?
While the more than 5,000
members of this troupe may
call themselves a circus, their
performances prove that the
term is woefully inadequate in
describing the vortex of color,
sound and motion that charac-
terizes their work. Actors are
required to do much more than
run through a series of spandex-
covered acrobatic acts - each
show is knit together by an over-
arching narrative or abstract
allegory that is chosen specifi-
cally because of its universality
and culture-bridging familiarity.
In this way, entire stories are
woven without the aid of spoken
language (their self-composed
music almost always utilizes
made-up words) using themes
that connect to audiences on
each of the six continents where
the company performs. The
passing of time, growing up, fall-
ing in love, dreams and reality,
the circle of life - each of these
themes have been infused into a
stream of pantomimed emotion
W put to music.
These wonders of the human
imagination are then ingeniously
paired with the wonders of the
human form. Feats of strength

and power are synthesized into
graceful acts of expression,
allowing actors to become living,
breathing, bending and flying
works of performance art - in
the truest sense of the phrase.
This synthesis is only one
facet of the proof that fine art
is a genre surprisingly capable
of change - the venues used by
Cirque du Soleil are technologi-
cal and visual marvels in their
own rights. The company has
mastered the art of performing
in integrated 3-D spaces that
project outward into their audi-
ences even as they draw viewers
into the action. Stages of every
shape and size spin, unfold, and
catch fire as the shows burst
out of the proscenium and take
advantage of everything from
tanks of water to wires in the air.
Canadian circus
troupe blends
fine arts and
modernity.
Cirque du Soleil has also
bridged yet another gap that the-
ater has yet to embrace - their
performances have consistently
proven to be some of the best
examples of art translated onto
film. More than 10 video-record-
ed versions of various shows
have been produced, garnering
three Gemini Awards and four
Primetime Emmy Awards. With
masterful editing and a keen
sense of performance space, the
movie versions of the shows are
the next best thingto actually
sitting beneath the human com-
ets suspended above you.
Artistically, Cirque du Soleil
tackles metaphors that can't
be put into words, creating
a vibrant consciousness that
builds on established forms
without being weighed down by
an unspoken dedication to them.
There's something electrifying
about watching a dying firebird
proudly preen its scraggly feath-
ers in between staggering leaps
to which the traditional self-
aware poise of a ballerina doesn't
do justice. Limited only by the
imaginations of their artistic
directors, shows become more
like living works of art than the-
atrical presentations.
Cirque du Soleil gives hope to
the future of art that strives to
evolve beyond the standard visu-
al, audible and theatrical arts
triad that has dominated for so
long. By embodying the abstract
without forgetting where it
comes from, the company has
managed to enchant children of
all ages by dragging out our ids
and giving them a physical form.
With 21 different productions
currently performing around the
world, it seems as though Cirque
du Soleil has found a niche with-
in all of us.

Film adaptation
of popular novel
beats the odds
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
Now hold on just a second.
Can it be possible? Can a film
based on a bestselling young
adult saga, with
a fan base ****
frighteningly
similar to that The Hunger
of the "Twi- Games
light" series
(a moment's At Quality16
pause to shud- and Rave
der at the mem-
ory...), hit all Lionsgate
the right notes?
Yes, yes it can! "The Hunger
Games," with its flawless cast,
perfectly paced action and dra-
matic intensity, is everything
we've been waiting for and more.
Breathe easy, Suzanne Collins
- perhaps Hollywood's finally
learning how not to mess up a
beloved piece of fiction.
Though, the movie's victory
has to be due in part to Collins's
contribution to the screenplay.
Director Gary Ross's ("Seabis-
cuit") decision to hire Collins,
writer of the original trilogy,
yields a film that's true to its lit-
erary counterpart even after
certain scenes from the book are
cut and altered. If anything, it
ensures that the books' multitude
of fans get what they pay for - a
movie that's loyal to the material
it's inspired by.
To most, the story is familiar.
Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Law-
rence,"Winter's Bone") lives with
her mother and younger sister
Prim (newcomer Willow Shields)
in an exhausted part of District
12 called the Seam. As happens
annually, all children between

Tributessss ... make it work.
the ages of 12 and 18 from the
12 districts have to submit their
names for the Hunger Games - a
competition in which 24 children
battle to the death, used by the
Capitol to maintain totalitarian
control. When her 12-year-old
sister is picked to compete, Kat-
niss volunteers in Prim's place.
When it comes to the Capitol,
Ross lets his imagination fly. It's
precisely as over-the-top, color-
ful and extravagant as readers
undoubtedly expected. But just
as Katniss and fellow District 12
tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson,
"The Kids Are All Right") are
pawns in the Capitol's games, the
Capitol is a pawn in Ross's game.
It's a means for him to break the
emotional intensity of the games
themselves, to occasionally hide
the fact that under the love tri-
angle most teenagers in the audi-
ence have come to see, this film
is actually about survival, death,
desperation and unrestrained
animalistic instincts.

Execs at Lionsgate must have
really pushed hard for the film's
PG-13 rating. While not as Tar-
antino-esque as most would have
liked, "The Hunger Games" stays
true to the blood and gore of the
first book. Herein lies the film's
greatest strength - it's all about
raw emotion. There are no obtru-
sive, overwhelming soundtracks
that detract from the emotional
trauma of the lead actors at the
death of their friends.
This organic approach allows
the actors to shine in their roles.
Hutcherson is believably love-
stricken and embattled as the
guy who knows he can't win but
wants to make sure the girl he
loves does. Woody Harrelson, as
the tributes' mentor Haymitch,
is equally perfect as a drunk
mess trying to get his act togeth-
er. Of course, no one can forget
the adorably naive Effie Trin-
ket (Elizabeth Banks, TV's "30
Rock"). Her comedic one-liners
are as invaluable as Dnonald

Sutherland's ("Horrible Bosses")
cold stares as President Snow.
But while the games have two
winners, the film only has one.
Lawrence is a powerhouse of
talent. She churns out arrogant,
impatient, sweet, sexy, trauma-
tized and desperate faster than
the speed of one of Katniss's
arrows.
There's no other way of saying
it - this film is a cornucopia of
surprises. Instead of capitalizing
on its love triangle, it sticks to its
roots and captures the frustra-
tion of an oppressed society that's
just trying to survive. More than
anything, it's a beautiful ode to
'hunger' and 'passion' - the hun-
ger that drives people physically
and emotionally, the passion that
causes people to act against their
better judgement. As such, "The
Hunger Games" definitely leaves
you craving more.
So longbrooding, poutingvam-
pires - this is how a young-adult
adaptation is done.

VIDEO GAME NOTEBOOK
A'Dark Descent' into terror

'Amnesia' provides
realistic scares only
for the bravest
By JULIAN AIDAN
DailyArts Writer
At some point, everyone has
seen a scary movie and wondered
"what if that were me?" Not one of
those "Underworld"- or "Resident
Evil"-style flicks, in which you
would be a leather-bound badass
armed to the teeth against an
onslaught of hapless zombies, but
something more along the lines
of "Cabin Fever," "Texas Chain-
saw Massacre" or "Hostel." One
in which you're the helpless one,
trapped in an unfamiliar place
with no means of fighting back
against an onslaught of faceless,
sadistic psychos whose goal in life
is to destroy you in the most pain-
ful way possible.
Intentionally putting yourself
in that situation would be crazy,
right? On a scale of terrible things
that could possibly happen, from
losing your pencil to finding out
you made out with your sister,
waking up somewhere unfamil-
iar and knowing you're being
hunted would undeniably reside
close to the worst. That's where
playing "Amnesia: The Dark
Descent" fits in.
Frictional Games is a studio
known for making scary games.
The creators don't make and-
then-a-skeleton-jumped-out
games or bash-zombie-faces-in-
until-you-win games, but instead
survive-in-the-most-creative-
way-possible productions - such
as the "Penumbra" series - in
which "creative" means "passive,
and while crying."
"Amnesia: The Dark Descent"

is notorious in certain circles for
basically being one of the most
terrifying games on the planet.
You can't fight. You don't get a
map. You don't have the luxury
of being heavily armed, being an
Olympic sprinter or having night
vision - in fact, staying in the
dark too long makes you start hal-
lucinating, because being stalked
by deformed servants of a quasi-
immortal extraterrestrial in a
crumbling castle isn't terrifying
enough. You need to learn how
to hide, and fast - "Amnesia" is
nothing if not unforgiving and
relentless in its psychological
assault. ... Appetizing.
In case you haven't heard of

of therapy necessary for dealing
with the immense psychological
strain "Amnesia" induces.
None of this is to say that
"Amnesia" is a bad game, or that
you shouldn't play it under any
circumstances. It's awesome. The
scare factor is second-to-none,
and even though it's a year-and-a-
half-old, the graphics look pretty
good for a small developer such as
Frictional. Playing "Amnesia" is
an experience literally unlike any
other, and causes an adrenaline
rush that I'm pretty sure you'd
only feel when actually running
for your life.
Casual gamers and thrill-'
seeking hardcore players alike
can take advantage of its intense
atmosphere and simple gameplay
if they have the right mindset,
and anyone with even a passing
interest in gaming or a profound
disregard for the sanctity of their
undergarments should give it a
shot. Just snake sure to have a
good therapist on speed dial and
a good bit of caffeine on hand to
make up for the sleep you're guar-
anteed to lose.

FROZEN IN THE TUNDRA
Michigan 2

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
GREEN BAY, Wisc. - At
some point during the postsea-
son, overtime became the norm
for the Michigan hockey team.
In two of its four CCHA playoff
games, the Wolverines needed
an extra frame to decide things,
and it won both of those playoff
games.
But the first round of the
NCAA Tournament on Friday
night was different. Michigan
played Cornell to a 2-2 tie in
regulation, then lost a little less
than four minutes into over-
time.
A shot rebounded off the
front pad of fifth-year senior
goaltender Shawn Hunwick,
and he had no chance to recov-
er. He was caught out of posi-
tion, and Cornell's Rodger Craig
shoveled the puck past him - it
was the last shot Hunwick will
ever see in a Michigan uniform.
The Wolverines were
exhausted after a long weekend
in Detroit for the CCHA Cham-
pionship a week ago, which
included a double-overtime vic-
tory against Bowling Green in
the semifinal and a loss to West-
ern Michigan in the final.
Less than a week later, they
initially looked like they had
rested for a couple weeks.
Senior captain Luke Glen-
dening gave No. 2 Michigan its
best start of the season when he
recovered a rebound's rebound
a little over a minute into the
first period and sent it home.
Cornell goaltender Andy Iles
blocked the first and second
shots, but couldn't recover in

time to stop the third.
A little less than 30 seconds
later, junior forward Kevin
Lynch thought he had given the
Wolverines their quickest two
goals of the year. No. 14 Cornell
was going to have to deal with
a two-goal deficit less than two
minutes into the game, a fright-
ening prospect for a team in a
win-or-go-home playoff game.
But the officials ruled that
sophomore forward Luke Mof-
fatt had interfered with Iles,
and the goal was taken off the
board after Cornell took a time-
out. With the wind taken out
of its sails, Michigan didn't get
another puck in the net until
late in the third period.
"I'm not questioning the offi-
cials, but typically, you either
you blow the whistle or you
don't," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "If he's out of the
crease, you probably let itgo. It's
not a penalty."
Cornell tied it up halfway
through the first period, and the
shootout was supposedly on.
The tables seemed to be set
that way for Michigan in the
second period, when the Big
Red were called for a whopping
six penalties. One of those pen-
alties was a five-minute major
contact-to-the-head penalty on
Armand de Swardt, who was
given a game misconduct.
But the momentum of that
power play was promptly killed
when junior defenseman Lee
Moffie took a penalty of his own
just 10 seconds after De Swardt
left the ice.
The Big Red spent more than
half of the period in the box, but

Barely two minutes into

and Cornell had a second life.

skate off with it.
He made toward the benches,
toward his teammates, toward
his friends.
They said little.
As they patted him on the back,
he skated on until he arrived not
as his bench, but at the bench

next to it, where he found a Cor-
nell assistant coach.
For the last time, Hunwick
took the puck out of his glove, and
he handed it to the coach whose
team had just defeated him. It
was their goal, not his, and he
wanted them to have it.
Behind him, workers took the
goal off its moorings and moved it
through the tunnel.
After shaking hands, Hunwick
skated off past that empty crease.
Thirty seconds later and one
time zone away, clocks at Yost Ice
Arena blinked to midnight.

Closing the book on the unlikeliest Michigan hero

S hawn Hunwick's entrance
was scripted.
When Shawn finally
heard his name called, he was
supposed to explode off the
bench, tear
across the ice -
pumping his
first and turn
sharply into
his crouch
when he
reached the
crease-
He was STEPHEN J.
supposed to NESBITT
re-enact the
famous scene
from the 1993 film Rudy. Shawn
Hunwick wouldbe Daniel "Rudy"
Ruettiger. The kickoff would be
a faceoff. Notre Dame Stadium
would be Yost Ice Arena.
Shawn turned to Chris Porter
and laughed at the idea.
It was the first time the 5-foot-
6 wisp of a goaltender had been
compared to Rudy. Chris, the
youngerbrother of Michigan's
second Hobey Baker winner
Kevin Porter, was on to some-
thing.
"Five fist pumps as you run out
there, just like Rudy," Chris said.
"No one's going to remember
you if you're only goingto play a
few plays anyway, so you've got to
do something funny."
But that wasn'thow Shawn
Hunwick would be remembered.
Seated in the open-air patio
outside BTB Cantina on South
University Avenue, with the sun
beating down on a warm summer
afternoon, Shawn called his shot.
Ittwas August 2007, and
Shawn, a third-string freshman
goaltender, declared that he
would be the Michigan hockey
team's starting goaltender before
it was all said and done.
That might normally fly. But
not for this last-resort goalie.
That's because his brother, senior
defenseman Matt Hunwick, was
seated beside him.
"Hey, even though you think
that, you can't say that stuff,"
Matt said, pulling Shawn aside.
"You're coming here to be a role
player, so you need to know your
role and accept that."
Shawn wasn't really serious.
Truth be told, he didn't even
belongthere. Just a few months.
earlier, he was preparing to join
the hockeyteam at Division-III
Adrian College, when he got a
chance phone call.
It was Kevin Porter and Chad
Kolarik, two of his brother's
teammates at Michigan. Steve
Jakiel didn't show up for spring
workouts.
"We need athird goalie. Do you
want us to talk to coach?" they
asked.
"Sure, I guess," Shawn said.
Small beginnings.
Later that week, he dressed
up fancy, shaved, made sure his
blonde hair was standing just

to be remembered by the people
inside the program.
"That's what I thought I was
going to be. No one's ever goingto
know my name. I'm not going to
get spotted on campus."
Shawn won't be remembered
for his three years holding a clip-
board. He'll be remembered for
being a HobeyBaker finalist.
He won't be remembered for
three consecutive season-ending
overtime losses. He'll be remem-
bered forbeing the No.1 goalie in
Michigan history in goals-against
average (2.05) and save percent-
age (.928), and seventh in wins
(54).
He won't be remembered for
failing to repay Berenson with a
national championship. He'll be
remembered forbeingthe closest
we'll come to Cinderella, to Rudy.
Shawn doesn't know what's
next. One NHL team followed
him during the season, but he's
hedging on a few offers he's had
from East Coast and European
teams. He'll figure it out in the
next week or so.
He'll give himself two or three
years in hockey. If nothing works
out, he'll turn to coaching or
front-office hockey administra-
tion.
"Obviously, it's a little nerve-
wracking when you don't know
where you're going to go," he said
with a nervous laugh.
For now, he's very much where
he was when he arrived at Michi-
gan - waiting for his chance.
"The last few years I've been
playing with house money. Pretty
much my whole time at Michi-
gan has been house money. I was
never expected tobe here, so
everything I did here was adding
on top of that."
Shawn Hunwick's entrance
was scripted. His legacy, though,
wasn't.
And that's how Shawn Hun-
wick willbe remembered.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Michigan fifth-year senior goalie Shawn Hunwick carried the Michigan hockey team to three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, losing 3-2 each time.

right and marched into Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson's office.
When Shawn marched back out,
he was still missing something.
He forgot to ask one question,
so he called Michigan assistant
coach Billy Powers to clarify.
"I had to ask Billy if I actually
got a spot on the team, because
I didn't comprehend what they
were sayingto me," Shawn
remembers.
He had a spot. But that was it.
Shawn was the third-string
goaltender, firmly planted behind
junior Billy Sauer and freshman
Bryan Hogan.
"I remember reading on one
blog, where someone wrote,
'(Hunwick) is a waste of space.
I'm not sure why we're bring-
ing him in. He's going to stand at
the end of the bench with a clip-
board,"' Hunwick said.
"That's pretty much what I
was for the first three years I was
here. That's where I thought I was
going to be."
Shawn finally made his fresh-
man debut in a 10-1 rout of
Nebraska-Omaha on March 14,
2008. He didn't pump his fist as
he skated onto the ice, as he'd for-
gotten all aboutbeing Rudy.
"I think everyone (in the
crowd) was probably scared when
I first came in, thinking, 'Who's
the little midget in the net?"'
Shawn said.
He played two minutes and 52
seconds. He didn't see the ice the
next season. That was alright.
"Back then is when I wasn't
even sure if I could play, soI
wasn't too beat up about not play-
ing," Shawn said.
"I was just more safe and sound
on the bench."
But that wasn't how Shawn
Hunwick would be remembered.

Shawn carved up the crease
at the Xcel Energy Center in St.
Paul, Minn. It was a big day.
He had vaulted Michigan into
the National Championship game
against Minnesota-Duluth by
shutting out No.1 overall seed
and perennial powerhouse North
Dakota two nights earlier.
And it was Shawn's 24th birth-
day.
After a lingering groin injury
had sidelined Hogan for the sec-
ond half of the season, Hunwick
had taken over. He did the same
thinga year earlier, as a junior,_
when he filled in for Hogan in the
last light of the regular season
and carried Michigan to the brink
of a Frozen Four berth, before
Miami (Ohio) finally prevailed in
a double-overtime thriller.
But now he was in net for the
championship game. He was no
emergency fill-in - he was Beren-
son's starter. He was Michigan's
star.
He was Cinderella. He was
"Tiny Jesus." He was Rudy.
And the birthday boy was still
a walk-on. Michigan's star goal-
tender was still paying for college,
splitting a scholarship with junior
captain Luke Glendening.
It's a funny thought, all things
considered.
"It's what we signed up for. We
came in as a walk-ons. We could
have gone..."
He paused.
"Actually, neither of us could
have gone anywhere else."
Shawn laughed. He and Glen-
dening really didn't have other
options. If Michigan hadn't
called, Glendening would have
joined Shawn at the Division-III

level, playing football at Hope
College or Wheaton College.
Matt, a Colorado Avalanche
defenseman, had been helping
out, paying for his younger broth-
er's tuition at Michigan. Halfway
through his senior season, a few
months before the national title
game, Berenson told Hunwick
that he finally had a full scholar-
ship open. Shawn was coming
back for a fifth year.
Michigan lost to Minnesota-
Duluth in overtime. The Cinder-
ella story was on hold. Rudy had
come up short - on his birthday.
But that wasn't how Shawn
Hunwick would be remembered.

forgotten?
Shawn wrestled with the ques-
tion. He doesn't know exactly
what happens next. His journey
is over. Michigan lost in overtime
again, this time to Cornell.
Less than 48 hours after the
game, Shawn sank back into his
seat and gazed across Dewey
Street on a sunny Sunday after-
noon.
He hadn't expected it to end
this early. But, then again, he
didn't expect it to everbegin.
From the most inglorious roots
came a star that won't be forgot-
ten.

Blue takes rubber match vs. JPFW =


By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Entering the weekend, the last
time the Michigan baseball team
won consecutive contests was
during a
four-game IPFW 6
winning MICHIGAN 8
streak in
late Febru- I PF W 2
ary. But if MICHIGAN 4
this week-
end's series MIC HIGAN 11
against
Indiana-
Purdue Fort Wayne was any
indication, winning consecutive
games might become a regular
occurrence for the Wolverines.
Behind a dominant pitching
performance from junior left-
hander Bobby Brosnahan and an
offensive outbreak, Michigan (11-
12) took the rubber match of the
series, 11-2, after a 8-6 loss on Fri-
day and a 4-2 victory on Saturday.
"It's good to have (Brosnahan)
back after he missed one start
last week," said Michigan coach
Rich Maloney. "He was throwing
three pitches for strikes, and he
was outstanding. The good thing
is that we got to limit his pitches."
Brosnahan stifled IPFW's
offense all game. He retired the
first 10 batters he faced and didn't
allow a hit until the fifth inning,
when Mastodon third baseman
Kristian Gayday led off the frame
with a single. But it was the only
trouble that Brosnahan encoun-
tered while on the mound. He
then recorded six consecutive
outs before Maloney pulled him
to keep his arm fresh.
In six innings of work, Brosna-
han gave up only one hit, struck

out four batters and allowed just
two baserunners.
"I just (tried) to mix my pitch-
es," Brosnahan said. "They're not
really an offensive powerhouse,
so if you throw strikes, you're
going to get a good result."
Brosnahan's performance coin-
cided with the Wolverines' best
day at the plate in three weeks, as
eight different batters recorded at
least one RBI. Sparked by junior
centerfielder Patrick Biondi,
Michigan scored runs in four of
the first five innings, including
four-run frames in the fourth and
fifth innings. Senior catcher Coley
Crank and senior third baseman
John Lorenz smacked back-to-
back solo home runs to start off
the bottom of the fifth inning.
But Biondi set the tone for the
Wolverines. The junior - who
went 4-for-5 with two runs, two
RBIs and one stolen base - was a
constant threat on the basepaths.
The leadoff hitter went 7-for-11
during the series and reached
base four more times on walks.
"I've been able to get on base to
lead off a couple of games lately,
which is good, and it helped out
our team today," Biondi said. "I'm
glad that our whole team kind of
woke up, because we hadn't been
playing as well as we wanted. It
was nice to come out today and
get a lot of hits and score some
runs."
Brosnahan wasn't the only
starting pitcher to one-hit the
Mastodons this weekend. On Sat-
urday, senior right-hander Bran-
don Sinnery earned his first win
of the season when he befuddled
IPFW's lineup. The Mastodons
managed only one hit and an
unearned run against Sinnery in

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Junior Bobby Brosnahan retired the first 10 batters he faced on the weekend.

seven innings.
IPFW didn't fare much bet-
ter against the Wolverines' bull-
pen. Freshman Trent Szkutnik,
fifth-year senior Travis Smith
and freshman James Bourque fin-
ished off the one-hitter, as Michi-
gan won, 4-2. Crank batted in two
runs in the first inning, and the
Wolverinesscored insurance runs
late to secure the victory.
Michigan didn't have as much
early success at the plate in its
thrilling home opener. On Friday,
the Wolverines were unable to
find any sort of rhythm on offense
against IPFW's Charles Weaver
until the ninth inning. Weaver,
who entered the series with a 5.06
ERA, allowed only one earned run
and struck out out nine batters
through the first eight frames.
But in the ninth inning, his con-
trol deserted him. ]He walked
two and hit a batter before being
yanked with the bases loaded and
one out.

The Wolverines took advan-
tage of the opportunity. With
the crowd cheering, sophomore
catcher Cole Martin walked to
bring in a run to cut the deficit
to 5-2. Freshman left fielder Will
Drake then knocked in two more
runs with a two-out single before
O'Neill singled home the tying
run. The two teams traded runs in
the tenth inning before the Mast-
odons' left fielder Carter DeBoe,
who was 0-for-5 up to that point,
smacked a two-run homerun off
junior Kyle Clark, giving IPFW an
8-6 victory. Junior right-hander
Ben Ballantine, who started the
game, struck out a career-high
seven batters in five innings of
work.
Though a sweep was expected,
Maloney was encouraged by how
Michigan bounced back.
"In the first game, they took
it to us," Maloney said. "But give
our kids credit for fighting back.
It's good to see our guys respond."

Somehow, Cinderella stayed
at the ball for three mesmeriz-
ingyears.
The kid who was too small
to geta chance in goal, got
a chance in goal. The goalie
who wasn't good enough to
start, started. The starter who
wouldn't possibly win, won.
He led Michigan on its
miracle run to clinch an NCAA
Tournament berth in 2010, and
then willed it into the National
Championship game the follow-
ing year.
He was the team's best player
all season, but he was more than
that.
"What can you say to Hun-
wick?" said senior forward Luke
Glendening.
"He's been the rock of this
team for three years now. Words
can't describe what you say to
him."
Three years' worth of memo-
ries came tumbling toward
Hunwick eight minutes into the
overtime period against Cornell
on Friday. Three years of chance
injuries and breaks, three years
of saves, three years of improb-
able wins, burst past Derek DeB-
lois and Kevin Lynch.
A lifetime of those who told
him he would never make a save
for Michigan stared Hunwick in
the face and dared him to save a
Greg Miller wrister.
And, with an outstretched
pad save, he did.
If this really were Cinderella,
if this were a fairy tale, that
would be that.
Michigan would ride the

momentum of that great save to
a season-saving overtime win.
But this isn't a fairy tale and
there are no happily ever afters,
even for Shawn Hunwick. This
is college hockey, and this is
single-elimination, and the play-
ers? Humans.
So that wasn't that, Michigan
didn't go down and score, and
Hunwick didn't get the ring.
"Shawn Hunwick here has
had a Cinderella year," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"I wish he could've had abetter
ending."
And the ending?
All-too-human: Hunwick
couldn't control the rebound,
Rodger Craig put the puck into
the open net, and at 10:56 on a
rainy night in Green Bay, Wisc.,
the career of the most improb-
able goalie in Michigan hockey
history ended.
Losing the battle against
tears, Shawn Hunwick passes
Cornell coach Mike Schafer at
12:23 a.m.
Schafer was walking to the
podium to speak to the media.
Hunwick was walking out.
"One of the classiest things
I've seen in 25 years of coach-
ing," Schafer would say of Hun-
wick's gesture to Cornell after
the game.
Outside, ina concrete hall-
way, a man whose Cornell tie
matches Hunwick's eyes taps
the former Michigan goalie on
the shoulder and shakes his
hand.
Hunwick turns to his right
toward his locker room. He
stops, then turns back and calls
out:
"Good luck tomorrow."
You too, Shawn.


SWEEP
From Page 1B
Amy Knapp crushed her second
home run of the season to deep
right field. The hit landed half-
way up the right-field bleachers
and traveled an estimated 260
feet, according to Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins.
Hutchins was impressed by
the perseverance displayed by
Knapp, who was replaced but
reinserted into the game due to
the rule allowing one starter per
team to re-enter the game.
"I pinch hit for her, and she
didn't hold her head," Hutchins
said.
Perseverance is a trait that
Hutchins believes the team pos-
sesses.
"It's tough to play a team three
times and beat them all three,"
Hutchins said. "We had to perse-
vere and we persevered through-

out this game."
Freshman pitcher Haylie Wag-
ner progressed as the weekend
series progressed. After going
the distance in Michigan's first
game, which was shortened to
five innings due to the mercy
rule, Wagner relieved freshman
pitcher Sara Driesenga after
three innings in Saturday's sec-
ond game.
Hutchins said Driesenga
"threw a couple fat pitches that
(Penn State) hit well," and as a
result, she was yanked after three
innings.
Driesenga started the inning
by giving up a leadoff walk to the
Nittany Lions. After junior sec-
ond baseman Ashley Lane made
an error, pitching coach Bonnie
Tholl, freshman catcher Lauren
Sweet and Driesenga met at the
mound in an attempt to calm
the pitcher down. The aftermath
of the meeting was not what
Hutchins wanted. Driesenga

went on to walk the next batter
to load the bases and then gave up
a two-run double to sophomore
catcher Kasie Hatfield, making
the score 5-2.
Hutchins had to pull the plug.
"When the bullpen comes in
the game, it's their job to stop the
bleeding," Hutchins said.
This was exactly what Wagner
did.
Though Wagner was able to get
out of the jam and earn the win in
the mercy-rule-shortened game,
she did not appear as sharp as
she has been. However, her per-
formance on Sunday was at that
level.
"She seemed a little bit more
relaxed," Hutchins said. "Haylie
really came back."
The Wolverines' patience at
the plate was key for Michigan
over the weekend.
In the three-game set, the
Wolverine hitters drew 20 walks,
including 10 in one of Saturday's

games.
"Quality at-bats are the reason
we get runs," Hutchins said. "We
are trying to gain momentum in
quality at-bats."
The Wolverines' play this
weekend showed the potential
the team has.
"We're approaching it like we
should have been approaching it
the whole year," said senior cen-
terfielder Bree Evans.
Something that Hutchins was
reminded of this weekend was
the 2005 championship team's
motto: "When the bottom of the
order comes through, champion-
ships are won."
Hutchins knows her team is a
very capable one. She envisions a
three-tool team - good pitching,
good defense and hitting hittable
pitches.
"You have to be consistent
in all those categories to have
a chance to achieve any of our
goals," Hutchins said.

press conference by mentioning
it.
"The goal that was disallowed
was obviously a factor in the
game," Berenson said.
It became more than a factor.
The game's entire complexion
was changed. The Big Red played
like a team with absolutely noth-
ing to lose. And why shouldn't
they have? The nightmarish start
proved to be
nothing more
than a bad
dream. "The g

it caught the
Wolverines off
guard, no mat-
ter how highly they thought of
the Big Red.
"When I popped one in, emo-
tions were running high," Lynch
said. "We're astrongenough team
where we could come back (from
the disappointment of the no
goal). ... Obviously, we would've
liked to have had that goal. Going
up 2-0 would've been huge."
Though the Wolverines
couldn't hang on to the lead that
eventually disappeared, they
never let the game out of their
reach. In fact, when Lynch did
finally score - a blue-collar goal
late in the third period off of a
grade-A chance in front of the net
- his disallowed goal became all
the more important.
But when Schafer called time-
out just over a minute into the

game, his counterpart Berenson
didn't even think that the tally
could be taken off of the board.
Then, when the call came for a
review, he was confused.
"I was wondering why it was
being reviewed," Berenson said.
"I thought they called a timeout
because of the momentum. ... If
I were their coach, I probably
would've called a timeout, too.
"When a player goes through
the crease, typically - and I'mnot
questioning the officials - but,
typically, they'll blow the whis-
tie. If he's out
of the crease,
you'll probably
oal that let itgo."
The time-
allowed out did end up
being about
ViouSly momentum,
but not in the
:tor let's-stop-
the-bleeding
manner Scha-
fer probably
intended. Rather, when the refer-
ee crossed his arms to signal the
disallowed goal, the momentum
swungtoward Cornell.
The Wolverines felt helpless
when the officials changed the
call.
"Goals are precious this time of
year," Berenson said. "If you score
(one), you'd like to know they're
sure.
"And I'm sure they were sure....
We had something going (before
the review)."
Berenson couldn't have asked
for a more promising opening two
minutes from his team. But the
disappointment of the stripped
goal made the Wolverines look
like the ones with an uphill climb,
not the Cornell team that then
trailed.

CORNELL
From Page 1B
their penalty kill weathered the
onslaught, penalty after penalty.
"Our penalty killers tonight
were just unbelievable," Iles said.
"Those guys are the ones who
really stole the show in the sec-
ond period and they did a great
job. We were really able to build
off that momentum going into
the third."
The Wolverines came out flat
in the third period, managing
just two shots through the first 16
minutes of the final frame, high-
lighted by the only power play of
the period. That man-advantage
got exactly zero shots on goal.
The season was slipping out

of hand, a sloppy performance to
send off the senior class in Green
Bay.
Then Lynch, so often the
example of a Wolverine skater
that plays his best when the
lights are the brightest, pulled
Michigan out from its deep
slumber. He made sure this goal
counted, sliding the puck past
Iles, who was out of position
after a rebound, with just over
four minutes remaining.
The game almost ended with
12 seconds left, as the puck sat
a couple feet away from send-
ing the Wolverines to a second-
round matchup against Ferris
State.
But Isles and a swarm of
defensemen flew over to sit on
the puck.

After a third intermission,
Cornell took over in overtime
and ended Michigan's season.
An overtime defeat wasn't
how it was supposed to end for
the one-seed Wolverines. They
drew what was considered the
easiest regional bracket, play-
ing a Cornell team that won five
fewer games than Michigan.
Hunwick, a former walk-on,
was supposed to continue his
brilliant career to the Frozen
Four in Tampa Bay, Fla., where
he would be flanked by one of the
most heroic and unlikely senior
classes in recent Michigan hock-
ey history.
"It's a tough pill to swallow
because we've had some real
good efforts from our team this
year, particularly with Shawn

Hunwick, who has had a Cinder-
ella career here," Berenson said.
"I wish he could have had a bet-
ter ending."
This team played through the
CCHA gauntlet, coming back
from the dead in November and
losing just four games in the first
three months of 2012, working
through the ups and downs that
came with having eight fresh-
man and four seniors.
Hunwick, Glendening, defen-
seman Greg Pateryn and for-
ward David Wohlberg pulled off
their Michigan jerseys for the
last time on Friday night, with a
plane waiting to fly them back to
Ann Arbor. This wasn't expect-
ed.
This wasn't how it was sup-
posed to end.

Pitching key for Michigan

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Freshman forward Phil Di Giuseppe battles for positioning on a faceoff in Saturday's 3-2 loss to Cornell.
Power play runs dry

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
GREEN BAY, Wisc. - Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson bluntly
stated that Cornell's special
teams were a "factor" and "a big
part of the game" in No. 2 Michi-
gan's 3-2 overtime loss against
the Big Red in first round of the
NCAA Tournament.
That's a bit of an understate-
ment. Cornell's special teams
were clear difference-makers in
a game that saw 27 minutes of
penalties for the Big Red but no
power-play goals from the Wol-
verines.
Cornell's own power play
knotted up the game with Michi-
gan in the firstperiod and itspen-
alty kill propelled them forward
in the opening minute of the sec-
ond frame.
That second stanza was what
started the slew of penalties.
The referees could not keep their
whistles away from their lips,
with the game being paused often
to march various players into the
penalty box.
Amidst all the whistle blowing
and game stoppages, Cornell's
Armand de Swardt took a five-
minute major penalty and gaie
misconduct for contact to the
head. It seemed like the answer

Michigan was looking for, the
perfect occasion to make a state-
ment and get back in the game.
Hardly. Ten seconds after the
call was made, junior defense-
man Lee Moffie took his own
trip to the sin bin, throwing away
part of the Wolverines' valuable
opportunity.
Once Moffie left the box,
Michigan still had another three
minutes to try and make the
most of its man advantage. And
the team tried its best, getting 13
shots on goal during the course of
the game misconduct.
But the puck didn't find twine.
The closest thing the Wolverines
saw to a goal during that five-
minute stretch was just a loud
clank off the post.
"We had 13 shots on goal dur-
ing that five-minute major,"
Berenson said. "We didn't score.
That was the frustrating part,
especially when you're behind in
a game."
But just like Moffie's penalty,
the power-play pendulum took
another swing in Cornell's direc-
tion when sophomore defen-
seman Jon Merrill's tripping
penalty resulted in a Cornell pen-
alty shot.
Locke Jilson took a weak shot
on goal that fifth-year senior
goaltender Shawn Hunwick eas-

ily saved. And though it was still
a sobering reminder to the Wol-
verines about how costly mind-
less penalties can be, Michigan
seized the momentumback again
to play what Berenson consid-
ered to be some of the team's best
hockey of the night.
"We felt that we played well in
the last five minutes of the second
period," Berenson said. "We just
wanted to play the game five-on-
five and get some pace going, get
some momentum going."
The power play visibly strug-
gled all year. The Wolverines
converted a measly 15 percent of
the time with the man advantage.
Cornell doesn't have that much
better of a record at 17 percent,
but with the Big Red holding onto
the lead for the most of the night,
their primary concern was sim-
ply to starve off Michigan for as
long as possible.
Despite the special team's
woes, junior forward Kevin
Lynch didn't think the power
play's problems deflated the
morale of the team at all during
that five-minute period.
"For us guys on the bench that
aren't on the power play, we just
try to get the team going," Lynch
said. "We just try to get our team
going, and we get out there, we
just try and do the best we can."

In their first career Big Ten
games, freshman pitchers Hay-
lie Wagner and Sara Driesenga
handled the event like veterans -
calm, cool and collected.
This past weekend, the No. 20
Michigan softball team swept
Penn State (0-3 Big Ten, 7-18 over-
all) in a three-game series, win-
ning by scores of 11-2, 12-4 and
6-0.
Michigan (3-0,21-9) was able to
find a rhythm on the mound, but
its pitching wasn't the only story
over the weekend: the Nittany
Lions' bullpen was, too.
While Driesenga and Wag-
ner carried their matchups with
poise, Penn State struggled to
control its pitches, which led to
several runs for Michigan. The
troubles of Nittany Lions' bull-
pen gave confidence to the Wol-
verines' pitchers - they knew
they could rely on their offense to
maintain a lead.
"Anytime somebody gives you
something for free, don't you
think it's a good thing for your-
self and not so good for the other
team?" said Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins. "They gave us a lot of
free bases."
The Wolverines certainly capi-
talized, with 22 hits in two games
on the first day of play and a sea-
son-best 13 hits on Sunday. Michi-
gan's success at the plate Sunday
forced Penn State ace Lisa Aka-
mine to throw 137 pitches.
Meanwhile, left-hander Wag-
ner pitched a two-hitter while
striking out three from the
mound for Michigan in the first
game of the series.
"At first, I didn't think Haylie
was her most confident self out
there," Hutchins said Saturday.
"But she cleaned up in the end."
In the second game on Satur-
day, Driesenga, a right-hander,
started off by striking out her
first two batters. But after walk-
ing three, she was pulled in the
middle of the third inning, hav-
ing notched three strikeouts and
allowed two hits.
"Sara came out strong and she
looked great," Hutchins said. "We
took her out because bases were
loaded and we still didn't have

Sugiyama captures Big Ten vault title, 'M' places fourth

By GLENN MILLER JR.

There are 19 Big Ten Champi-
onship banners that hang inside
the Shepherd Training Center
- home of the Michigan wom-
en's gymnastics team. If all went
according to plan, the Wolverines
would have raised up their 20th
on Saturday night.
But Michigan's season hasn't
gone according to plan. It's been
riddled with unexpected injuries
and flashes of inexperience.
The Wolverines will now have
to wait another year to raise
another banner.
Though, if there is a silver lin-
ing to Michigan's fourth-place
finish at the 2012 Big Ten Cham-
pionships, it may be the difference
a whole year can make. Just ask
freshman Sachi Sugiyama, who

took home Saturday's Big Ten
vault title in her rookie campaign.
No. 21 Michigan claimed the
top spot in the morning session of
Saturday's event but was topped
by three others during the sec-
ond session inside Iowa's Carver-
Hawkeye Arena. The Wolverines'
195.875 was fourth-best out of the
eightteams competing, as Nebras-
ka claimed its first Big Ten title
with a 197.100 finish.
"It was so exhilarating," Sugi-
yama said. "There's so much
energy going around. Everyone
wanted it so badly. It just came
down to who had the cleanest rou-
tines and who could hit today. We
did the best we could today, and
I'm proud of myteam for it."
Michigan (8-5 Big Ten, 13-8
overall) placed two competitors
on the podium at the conclusion
of the day's events, while posting

its fourth-highest overall score
for the season. In addition to her
vault crown, Sugiyama earned
second on uneven bars after being
bested by the Cornhuskers' Lora
Evenstad in the second session.
Sophomore Joanna Sampson tied
for runner-up on vault, contribut-
ing to the team's second-highest
score this season for the event.
Both Sugiyama and Sampson were
selected to theAll-Championships
Team, while junior Katie Zurales
represented the team for the Big
Ten Sportsmanship Award.
The Wolverines' strong start
on beam was executed without a
single fall, as they tallied a 48.725.
Freshmen Annette Miele led
Michigan with a 9.800, her sec-
ond time this season recordingthe
team's top score on beam. From
the middle of the lineup, Zurales
posted a 9.775, only to be followed

by sophomore Shelby Gies' 9.750.
A pair of 9.700s from Sampson
and sophomore Stephanie Colbert
rounded out the rotation for the
Wolverines. The team continued
its streak of consecutive beam
performances without counting
a fall since its meet in February
against Utah.
"The first event, you get your
nerves out," Zurales said. "It was
challenging, but we started off
solid. I am so proud of everyone.
We all went out there and hit real-
ly solid routines. Again, I think
we have a lot to be proud of, and I
can't say that enough."
In its second rotation, Michigan
looked to continue its momentum
on floor. Zurales' team-leading
9.825 was accompanied by four
other Wolverine scores of 9.700 or
higher. A pair of 9.750s from Sugi-
yama and Miele was followed by

Sampson and sophomore Reema
Zakharia with 9.725 and 9.700,
respectively. At the halfway point
of the meet, Michigan (97.475)
trailed both Illinois (97.850) and
Michigan State (97.500).
Needing a spark of energy, the
Wolverines completed a series of
spectacular vault routines. Sugi-
yama's event-winning 9.950 paved'
the way for Michigan, followed
by Sampson's 9.900, which tied
for second. Colbert's impressive
9.825 out of the leadoff spot was
preceded by Zurales' 9.875 and
Miele's 9.825. The Wolverines
finished with a total of 49.375 for
the event, their highest score in
a month. The freshman duo of
Sugiyama and Miele both set new
career-highs, while Colbert tied
her season-high on vault.
"The team really helped to
set her up for that, because we
were just sticking one vault after
another,"said Michigan coach Bev
Plocki. "When you're doing that,
you help to build the scores. It was
a beautiful vault, and she absolute-
ly nailed the landing. It's pretty
impressive to come out your fresh-
men year winning first and second
place on two of four events."
As Michigan headed into the
final event on bars, it trailed
Illinois by one-tenth of a point.
Another team-leading score by
Sugiyama (9.900), contributed to
the Wolverines' late push to win.
Miele followed with a 9.825, as
did Zurales and Gies with a pair
of 9.800s. In her first-ever bars
routine, Colbert's 9.700 sealed
Michigan's win over the Fighting
Illini and a first-place finish in the
morningsession.
"After vault, I took it as a chal-
lenge," Colbert said. "I've never
competed on bars, and (I) knew it
wasn't my best event but felt confi-
dent. I tried to tell myself that it's
just another routine in the gym
and focus on doing what I needed
to do."
Colbert's final routine placed
her as an all-arounder for the
meet, as the Wolverines finished
with five all-arounders forthe first
time this season. Zurales' team-

leading total of 39.275 was closely
followed by Sugiyama's 39.250.
Miele broke her career-high with
a 39.175, while Colbert's 38.650
was her first career all-around
score. Sampson finished the night
with a 38.600 to complete the
night for Michigan.
Sugiyama's vault title made
her the program's 77th Big Ten
individual champion and the pro-
gram's 14th Big Ten vault champi-
on. The crown also continues the
Wolverines' streak of 22 straight
conference meets with at least one
Big Ten individual champion, dat-
ing back to 1991.
"I'm feeling amazing," Sugi-
yama said. "It's an indescribable
feeling to go up on the podium for
Michigan and win vault. To get
that first-place medal around your
neck is just so awesome."
Though Michigan won't raise
its sixth-consecutive Big Ten
banner this season, it still has
the opportunity to win at NCAA
Regionals - the team's ultimate
goal for the season. With Satur-
day's score added to the team's
regional qualifying score, the
Wolverines can now drop their
195.300 from the meet against
Georgia. That will improve Michi-
gan's RQS from 195.710 to 195.825
before heading to Regionals on
April 7.
The Wolverines will find out
where they'll compete on Mon-
day at 3 p.m. during the NCAA
Regionals Announcement Show.
No matter the venue, Michigan
will undoubtedly need its best per-
formance of the season in order to
make a reappearance to the Super
Six appearance in the hopes of
winninga national championship.
"I thought that with the excep-
tion of a couple small breaks we
had on floor, we had an excellent
meet," Plocki said. "We're young,
we've improved throughout the
season, and ultimately, we're
going home finishing higher than
the ranking we came in. That's
definitely awin for us. We're going
to look forward to coming back
and trying to regain our place at
the top of the podium next year."
