It is estimated that an addi-

Study: 6,382
students studying
abroad at the 'U'
By FARONE RASHEED
For theDaily
Students hailing from sev-
eral foreign countries have
helped place the University ina
new group of "Big Ten" schools
- the top 10 schools with the
largest international student
enrollment.
The University was ranked
eighth largest international
student body in the United
States - with a reported 6,382
international students as of
2012 - in the 2011-2012 Open
Doors Report released by the
Institute of International Edu-
cation this week,
Kavita Mokha, tIE manager
of public affairs; said Open
Doors - a publication funded
by the Bureau of Educational
and Cultural Affairs of the U.S.
Department of.State - aggre-
gates institutional data from
across the nation for a greater
understanding of the flux of
international students on U.S.
campuses.
Mokha said approximately
3,000 American institutions

self-report their numbers each
year to the IIE.
The Open Doors data
includes students who have
graduated from the University
but are still on a student visa,
which makes the data vary
slightly from the numbers the
University publishes on its
International Center website,
which report only 'currently
enrolled students, according to
John Greisberger, the director
of theUniversity's Internation-
al Center.
Greisberger said there were
"no surprises," referring to
the University's eighth place
finish in the category for the
second year in a row. Last year,
the University had 5,995 total
international students accord-
ing to 2010-2011 lIE data.
Greisberger said a diverse
and global education has
always been emphasized and
implemented at the University,
addingthat about 40 to 50 per-
cent of American students at
the University participate in
study abroad programs or some
type of academic experience
abroad. Greisberger said rela-
.tionships with international
students on campus encour-
age American students to go
abroad.

R.U.B. BBQ to
feature local beer,
home-style meals
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily Staff Reporter
Tailgating for the 2013 season
just got a little saucier with the
addition of R.U.B. BBQ Pub to
the South Campus diningscene.
The R.U.B. BBQ Pub, a Michi-
gan family-owned, sports-style

pub founded 40 years ago in
Detroit and Warren, will open
its third locationwithin the next
30 to 60 days on the corner of
South State Street and Packard
Avenue in the space formerly
occupied by the Packard Pub.
Customers will be able to
wash the Southern-inspired,
home-style meals down with
one of more than 200 varieties of
bottled beer, or 60 beers on tap,
many of which were produced in
Michigan.The smokehouse will
also offer tailgating packages

and draft beer to-go.
Omar Mitchell, the smoke-
house's regional manager, said
opening a restaurant in Ann
Arbor is almost obligatory given
its reputation as a "restaurant
capital" throughout the state.
"As crazy as it may sound,
Ann Arbor is missing great bar-
becue," Mitchell said. "They
have many different styles of
cuisine, but good old Southern
comfort barbecue is missing."

Interior secretary apologizes for
threatening reporter in Colorado

Said he would punch
journalist for wild
horse program
questions
COLORADO SPRINGS,
Colo. (AP) , U.S. Interior Sec-
retary Ken Salazar apologized
Wednesday for threatening to
punch a Colorado reporter who
asked him about problems with
the government's wild horse
program at a campaign event.
Salazar called Dave Philipps,
a reporter with The Gazette of
Colorado-Springs, to apologize
and offer him an interview, and
also sent him a letter of apol-
ogy. The apology came a day
after the newspaper posted a
story and an audio recording
of comments Salazar made at
an Election Day event in Foun-

President Barack Obama's re-
election.
Salazar told Philipps by
phone Wednesday that "I
want you to hear me loud and
clear," The Gazette reported. "I
shouldn't have said that."
In the audio recording from
the campaign event, Philipps is
heard asking for an on-camera
interview with Salazar, a Colo-
rado native who previously
served as a U.S. senator from
the state.
Salazar noted he was appear-
ing at the campaign event, about
80 miles south of Denver, in a
"personal capacity," and said
his office could arrange to talk
about Davis "at an appropriate
time."
After the interview, Salazar
accused Philipps of setting him
up. He then posed the threat,
saying: "If you do that to me
again, I'll punch you out."

is heard telling Salazar that he
previously got no response after
tryingimultiple times to arrange
an interview through Salazar's
press secretary.
The Gazette reported that
it initially held off on posting
the audio in hopes of getting
an interview with Salazar. But
a Colorado Springs-based wild
horse advocacy group, The
Cloud Foundation, publicized
the exchange Monday and the
Gazette published a story Tues-
day.
Philipps, a Pulitzer Prize final-
ist in 2010, and Gazette editor
Carmen Boles declined to com-
ment on the matter Wednesday
to The Associated Press, but the
newspaper did editorialize in
favor of Salazar issuing an apol-
ogy and granting an interview.
The BLM has struggled with
how to manage growing horse
herdswhich can double naturally

Egyptians chant slogans against latest Israel airstrikes in Gaza during aprotest in Cairo on Wednesday. Egypt has recalled its ambassador to Israel
afteran Israeli airstrike killed the military commanderof Gaza's ruling Hamas.
Egypt recalls its envoy to
Israel after Gaza offensive

Action taken in
protest of attacks in
territory
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's
Islamist president recalled the
country's ambassador to Israel
to protest its strikes in the Gaza
Strip on Wednesday after com-
ing under mounting domestic
criticism for not taking a strong
enough stance against Israel.
The move may signal a shift
in the way Cairo deals with
Israel following last year's
popular uprising that ush-
ered in the country's first free
presidential elections over the
summer and a wave of protests
since. Ousted President Hosni
Mubarak, who built close ties
with Egypt's neighbor, was
accused by Egyptians for refus-
ing to bend to popular pressure
for tough stands against Israel.
Ironically, his successor
President Mohammed Morsi,
who hails from the Muslim
Brotherhood, came under simi-
lar sharp criticism earlier this
week for failing to speak out
after seven Palestinians were

killed in Israeli airstrikes over
the weekend in retaliation for
rocket attacks by Gaza militants.
Secular parties and revolution-
ary groups on Monday held a
vigil denouncing Morsi and pro-
testing the Israeli airstrikes.
On Wednesday, Israel height-
ened its offensive by killing
Ahmad Jabari, the commander
of the Hamas military wing, in
one of some 20 airstrikes on the
Gaza Strip in the wake of fur-
ther militant rocket attacks. Ten
people were killed in the assault
on Gaza, two of them young chil-
dren.
This prompted a protest of.
around 200 people in down-
town Cairo on Wednesday who
demanded Morsi take a stand
against the Israeli attack.
"Morsi where is your deci-
sion," they chanted. "Our lead-
ers, enough with the silence. The
people of Gaza are dyingthere."
Late Wednesday, presi-
dential spokesman Yasser Ali
announced on state TV that
Morsi had recalled the Egyptian
ambassador.
The Muslim Brotherhood is a
vocal critic of Israel, and the Pal-
estinian Hamas militant group

that rules Gaza is an offshoot
of the group. Since taking office
as Egypt's first freely elected
president in late June, Morsi has
refused to meet or contact any
Israeli officials and doesn't even
mention Israel by name in official
statements.
Still, while relations have
cooled, Morsi has not brought
radical change in Egypt's policy
toward Israel. He has promised
to abide by Egypt's 1979 peace
deal with Israel and his govern-
ment has continued contacts
with Israel through its non-
Brotherhood members.
Israel and Egypt have quietly
cooperated over an Egyptian
military operation in the Sinai
Peninsula against Islamic mili-
tants who have been attacking
Egyptian forces and launch-
ing attacks into Israel. Morsi's
government also still tightly
controls Palestinian movement
through the Rafah border cross-
ing with Gaza in the Sinai. Under
Mubarak, Egypt's backing of a
blockade of Gaza imposed by
Israel after Hamas won elections
and later overran the territory
in 2007 was highly unpopular
among Egyptians.

The country already has a civil

Auctioning permits
for pollution
allowances
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Cal-
ifornia began auctioning permits
Wednesday for greenhouse gas
emissions, launching one of the
world's most ambitious efforts
to cut heat-trapping gases from
industrial sources.
The California Air Resourc-
es Board said it began selling
the pollution "allowances" in a
closed, online auction expected
to create the world's second-
largest marketplace for carbon
emissions.
Under the program, the state
sets a limit, or cap, on emissions
from individual polluters. Busi-
nesses are required to either cut
emissions to cap levels or, buy
allowances through the auction
from other companies for each
extra ton of pollution discharged
annually.
The board said the results of
the auction - what price is paid
for a ton of carbon, and how many'
companies participated - would
be released Nov. 19.
The cap-and-trade plan is a
central piece of AB32, the state's
landmark 2006 global warming
regulations.
The auction was being closely
watched nationally, as the world's
ninth-largest economy institutes
a program that has eluded law-
makers in Washington.

implemented a similar plan in
terms of scope, and it currently
operates the world's largest car-

ers in the northeastern United
States.
Failure of the California pro-
gram would be a devastating blow
to carbon control efforts nation-
ally, said Severin Borenstein, a
professor at the University of
California, Berkeley,an expert on
energy economics.
"Cap and trade is still probably
the most likely way we eventually
could get to a national carbon mit-

igation program," Borenstein said.
For the first two years of the
program, large industrial emit-
ters will receive 90 percent of
their allowances for free in a soft
start meant to give companies
time to reduce emissions through
new technologies or other means.
The cap, or number of allow-
ances, will decline over time in an
effort to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions year-by-year.
If a business cuts emissions
below its cap, it could profit by
selling its extra allowances at a
later auction.
Firms can also generate credits
by investing in forestry and other
projects that remove carbon from
the atmosphere. Those credits
can satisfy up to 8 percent of a
company's mandated emissions
reductions
Some businesses targeted by
the program have argued the
increased costs will drive jobs
out of California. Executives also
argue it could result in increased
emissions by businesses in neigh-
boring states that boost produc-
tion to grab business.
"Raisingcosts in California will
allow out-of-state firms to lower
prices and take market share,"
said Shelly Sullivan of the AB32
Implementation Group, a business
coalition that supports green-
house gas reductions but opposes
the auctioning of allowances.
"As it stands now the auction
equates to a tax for these busi-
nesses to continue to operate in
the state," Sullivan said. "Those
costs will be passed through to
consumers."
The California Chamber
of Commerce has filed a law-
suit challenging the air board's
authority to sell the allowances
to generate revenue for the state.
It claims the sale of allowances is
an illegal tax because taxes need
a two-thirds vote by the Legisla-
ture.
Stanley Young, a board
spokesman, said cap-and-trade
will withstand legal scrutiny.
"This market-based approach
to cutting greenhouse emissions
gives businesses the flexibility to
best decide how to reduce their
emissions," Young said.


Pakistan frees a handful (
prisoners to jumpstart pe

Move comes at
the request of the
Afghan government.
ISLAMABAD (AP) - Pakistan
agreed to free a handful of Tali-
ban prisoners at the requestofthe
Afghan government, in a move
meant to help jumpstart a shaky
peace process with the militant
group in neighboring Afghani-
stan, officials said Wednesday.
The decision to release the
prisoners - described as mid- and
low-level fighters - is the most
encouraging sign yet that Islam-
abad maybe willing to play a con-
structive role in peace efforts that
have made little headway since
they began some four years ago,
hobbled by distrust among the
major players involved, including
the United States.
The U.S. and its allies fighting
in Afghanistan are pushing to
strike a peace deal with the Tali-
ban so they can pull out most of
their troops by the end of 2014
without the country descending
into further chaos. Butcconsider-
able obstacles remain, and it is
unclear whether the Taliban even
intend to take part in the process,
rather than just wait until foreign
forces withdraw.
Pakistan is seen as key to the
peace process. Islamabad has
ties to the Taliban that date back
to the 1990s, and many of the
group's leaders are believed to
be based on Pakistani territory,
having fled there following the
U.S-led invasion of Afghanistan
in 2001.
There were conflicting reports
about whether Pakistan had
already released the Taliban pris-
oners or just intended to. There
was also some confusion about
exactly how many prisoners were
involved.
A Pakistani government offi-
cial and an intelligence official

said Islamabad released at least
seven Taliban militants Wednes-
day in response to a personal
request by Salahuddin Rabbani,
the head of an Afghan govern-
ment council for peace talks with
the Taliban, who was wrapping
up a three-day visit to Islamabad.
The officials spoke on condition
of anonymity because they were
not authorized to brief the media.
An Afghan official with
knowledge of the talks said no
prisoners had yet been released.
He said the delegation gave
Pakistan a list of 40 Taliban
prisoners they wanted released.
Pakistan provided a list of 10
prisoners they would release,
but this list was rejected by the
delegation, the official said on
condition of anonymity because
he was not authorized to talk to
the media. The two sides were
still trying to reach a compro-
mise, he said.
A joint statement put out by
Pakistan and Afghanistan on
Wednesday said "a number of
Taliban detainees are being
released" to support the peace
process at the request of the
Afghan government. It also
called on the Taliban and other
armed opposition groups to par-
ticipate in peace talks and sever
links with al-Qaida.
The Pakistani government
official said the men involved in
the release were "low- and mid-
level" fighters and did not include
the Taliban's former deputy lead-
er, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar,
who was captured in Pakistan in
2010.
The Afghan government has
repeatedly asked Pakistan to
release Baradar because he is seen
by some as crucial to the peace
process. Baradar was reportedly
conducting talks with the Afghan
government that were kept secret
from the Pakistanis, and his
arrest in the sprawling southern
port city of Karachi reportedly

)f Taliban
ace talks
angered Afghan President Hamid
Karzai.
Pakistan helped the Taliban
seize control of Afghanistan in
the 1990s - providing funding,
weapons and intelligence - and
the Afghan government and the
U.S. have accused Islamabad of
continuing to support the group.
Pakistan has denied the allega-
tions, but many analysts believe
the country continues to see the
militant group as an important
ally in Afghanistan to counter
archenemy India.
However, Pakistan is also wor-
ried about instability in Afghani-
stan following the planned
withdrawal of foreign forces.
If civil war breaks out again as
it did in the 1990s, hundreds of
thousands of Afghan refugees
could stream across the border
into Pakistan. Violence could
also give greater cover to Paki-
stani militants who are at war
with Islamabad.
These concerns have made a
peace deal more urgent in the
minds of Pakistanis.
Talat Masood, a retired Paki-
stani army general and defense
analyst, said the prisoner release
would improve the relationship
between Pakistan and Afghani-
stan, increasing the chances they
could work together to strike a
peace deal with the Taliban.
"It will improve the trust level
and confidence," Masood said.
"It will help Kabul find a genuine
solution to the problem."
The prisoners could also playa
positive role in the negotiations,
said Masood.
"I am sure the released Tali-
ban can play some partin making
the peace process a success," he
said.
Pakistan has also increased
'its cooperation with the U.S. in
recent months. The two sides
have set up working groups to
identify Taliban leaders who
could be open to reconcilia-

Students for regent
Board should amend its bylaws to allow oversight
A s the University's Board of Regents preps for its monthly
meeting on Thursday, the board, as of late, has stepped up
the security at its meetings, incorporating metal detectors,
a rope divider and a separate door through which the regents enter
and exit. Some allege that these measures create an unnecessary rift
between students and their University's governing body. To ensure
a direct line of communication between students and regents, the
regents should amend its bylaws to institute a de facto, non-voting
student regent position in the vein of the University of Nebraska.

State schools in Arizona, California, Texas
and Washington all have governor-appointed
student regent positions. Some of the posi-
tions including voting privileges and some
don't, but the general goal of each is to keep
students apprised of and involved in their
schools' decision-making processes. The
University cannot provide for a voting stu-
dent regent position, since an amendment to
the state constitution would be required to
allow the governor to appoint a student to the
University's Board of Regents, as regents are
elected by a statewide vote.
However, Nebraska's regents - who are
also selected via general election - amended
its bylaws to state, "the student body presi-
dent of the University of Nebraska Kearney
shall be recognized and serve as a de facto
member of the Board." Since the University of
Michigan's regency is restricted by the same
electoral procedures as Nebraska's, the Uni-
versity's board could follow their precedent
by amending its bylaws to incorporate one
or two student regent positions. While the
students' de facto designation would prevent
them from voting, they would still share a
table with the regents, discuss issues of per-
tinence to students and potentially influence
key decisions.
Newly elected regents Mark Bernstein and
Shauna Ryder Diggs won on a platform of
open mindedness and consensus building, so

it seems an opportune time to implement this
change. Nearly every governor-appointed
regency has either a voting or non-voting stu-
dent regent position. Though the fact that our
regents are chosen by general election may
hinder the speedy implementation of an offi-
cial, voting student regent position, a defacto
student regent is the logical first step.
Perhaps the provision of a non-voting stu-
dent regent would motivate interest groups to
propose an amendment to the state constitu-
tion intime for the midterm election. An ideal
voting student regent position would follow
the template of the University of Arizona's
Board of Regents. In Arizona, there are two
rotating student regent positions - one vot-
ing and one non-voting - appointed by the
state's governor to serve two-year terms. The
non-voting student spends their first year
learning about the regency in preparation for
a second year as a voting member.
Regardless of whether or not a de facto
student regent position could someday cul-
minate in an official voting position, an
amendment of the board's bylaws would be
a welcome means of bringing students closer
to those who make decisions that affect their
daily lives. The board - equipped with a new-
ly-elected regents - should follow Nebraska's
lead by establishing provisions for a student
regent position in whatever capacity the cur-
rent state laws allow.

've spent a significant portion
of my last two Julys, Augusts,
Septembers, Octobers and
Novembers
immersed in
dancing. Not
only dancing,
but choreo-
graphing, teach-
ing and helping
to produce the
Indian Ameri-
can Student HEMA
Association's KARUNA-
annual cul- KARAM
tural show. The
IASA show is
the largest student-run production
in North America, selling out Hill
Auditorium and raising thousands
of dollars for charity each year.
Until last week, I was committing
the equivalent of eight to 10 credit
hours per week to the show, and it
turned out to be a great success. But
still, I continue to encounter the
voices that ask, "Isn't that such a
waste of time?"
I'm committing more time to
a student organization than I am
to some of my classes, swapping
exam reviews for practices, writ-
ing e-mails instead of finishing
homework. Sound familiar? On my
resume, it seemsI'm dancing away
several hours of my school year,
which appears to be directly cor-
related with my less-than-stellar
academics. And I know I'm not
alone. Many of us discover our
passions in college - and they're
not in our schoolwork, but in our
extracurriculars. This inevitably
takes a toll on our academic per-
formance, but that doesn't stop us
from putting in countless hours
toward activities that will never
be graded. Just because something
doesn't contribute to your GPA,
however, doesn't make it a waste.
My position as a choreographer

is only one of many student organi-
zation experiences from which I've
learned immense amounts through-
out college. Even though many of
these activities have nothing to do
with what I'm studying, they repre-
sent a wide and important range of
interests that definitely contribute
to my skill set. But how much of this
passion can be justified within the
scope of college, where we're told
that our duties as a student come
first and foremost?
Perhaps our definition of "stu-
dent" is wrong. Sure, we're repeat-
edly told that college is about
much more than our GPAs. That's
why such a large percentage of us
are involved with student orga-
nizations. But for those of us who
commit so much time to these
organizations that we sometimes
compromise school for them, we
shouldn't have to feel that we are
inferior "students." In fact, organi-
zational experiences really do teach
us things we woild never learn in
class, and provide a release for aca-
demic or personal stress.
Choreographing for IASA has
taught me people skills, logistics,
time management and so much
more. This is the stuff that fuels not
only my personal conversations but
also my interviews. I've seen these
extracurricular skills regularly
translate into my academic life. No,
I'm not teaching my lab partners
how to dance But Im organizing
and leading group meetings, moti-
vating others to get things done
and dealing delicately with difficult
people or situations.
Yes, "go get involved!" people
say. Have new experiences, meet
diverse groups of people, broaden
your horizons! Until it starts mess-
ing with your grades. That's when
you should take a step back, they
say. Grades are more important,
and you're wasting your time.

Skipping one or two lectures for
a student organization is fine.
Per semester. But one or two in
a month? A week? Are you out of
your mind?
Students who
spend hours in
clubs shouldn't
feel inferior.
I suppose that's where we start
to wonder where to draw the line.
How much time spent on extracur-
riculars is too much? It's important
to have a full, vibrant resume, but
not at the cost of academic suc-
cess. For me, I'm willing to make
that compromise. I'm passing my
classes - and not necessarily by
painfully small margins - and
learning to balance my time well
as a result of all my other commit-
ments. Academics are important,
but grades mean little after our first
job or graduate experience. Extra-
curricular experiences stay with us
much longer and affect us in much
greater ways. These are the things
from college that will really stick.
Has my GPA taken a hit as a
result of all the time and effort I
spend on my student organiza-
tions? I'll be honest - absolutely.
But I wouldn't trade these experi-
ences for anything. I'm convinced
that they're worth something.
Something big; something more
than'what my B.S.E. degree alone
will stand for when I graduate.
And certainly something more
than a waste of time.

Curb anuC ear ran

As the United States closed out its elec-
tion season heavily concentrated on domestic
economic concerns, unemployment and job
growth, it's important not to lose siglit of issues
that resonate at the international level. While
the United States is largely focused on getting
itseconomymovingforward,Americansshould
push for their government to continue leading
global opposition toward Iran's nuclear pro-
gram. While sanctions on Iran's central bank
have taken their toll on the Iranian regime, it's
clear that more mustbe done to ensure that Iran
does not achieve nuclear capabilities.
Throughout the election season, American
leadership was noticeably quiet when it came
to discussing efforts to halt Iran's nuclear
developments. Meanwhile, Israel has been
working with the international community
to advance further cooperative efforts. In a
joint appearance, Israeli Prime Minister Bibi
Netanyahu and French President Francois
Hollande stated that while the current round
of international sanctions is adversely affect-
ing Iran's economy, it's equally clear that Iran
has continued its nuclear program.
The international community has already
taken several critical steps on this issue. Firstof
all, it is now widely accepted that Iran's nuclear
program isn't solely intended for the creation of
civilian power, but indeed exists with the inten-
tion of developing weapons. Additionally, the
international community has come together
around the implementation of economic sanc-
tions levied against the Iranian regime. Anoth-
er important step was taken Wednesday when
Hollande indicated agreement with Netanyahu
that further sanctions against Iran should still
be implemented by the European Union in
order to further curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.
However, after all of the progress that has
been made, there still exists serious discord
among members of the international commu-
nity regarding how to ultimately end Iran's
pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Namely, in order
to stop Iran's nuclear program, members of the
European Union are hesitant to open the door to
military action as a means of last resort. While

Hollande and Netanyahu showed unity on the
issue of sanctions, the French President refused
to endorse Netanyahu's view that it would still
constitute "a relief" if Iran were militarily pre-
vented from acquiring nuclear arms.
Instead, Hollande pushed for direct nego-
tiations with the Iranian government with-
out preconditions, a strategy that's perilous at
best, given Iran's propensity not to negotiate
in good faith and the Iranian leadership's his-
tory of irrational decision making. Indeed, a
rational actor facing economic sanctions, such
as those currently faced by Iran, would surely
demonstrate a willingness to end their nuclear
weapons program, wouldn't they? In order to be
effective in such negotiations, the international
community must establish a credible threat of
military action against Iran if they refuse to
make concessions. Otherwise, Iran is in a posi-
tion where, given their previous intransigence,
they have no real incentive to negotiate.
For all of these reasons, it's critical that
Americans push the government to outline a
clear strategy for ending Iran's nuclear pro-
gram. America must encourage the interna-
tional community to keep all options on the
table when dealing with Iran. Israel doesn't
wish to engage Iran militarily without cause.
Rather, they seek to wait until all other options
are completely exhausted in stymieing Iran's
pursuit of nuclear weapons. It's critical that the
international community takes this stand in
order to maintain a united front against Iran's
nuclear program. Only then will the threat of
military action be credible enough to induce
Iran to begin making concessions, should the
next round of sanctions be unsuccessful. Amer-
ica's diplomatic leadership is critical in standing
with Israel and their position against a nuclear
Iran. As such, the time is now for Americans
to ask their government to lead in opposition
to Iran. Though election season can lead our
nation to be insular, the Iranian threat contin-
ues to pose danger nonetheless and must be a
priority for our elected leaders.

Pseudoscience, real money

A recent study bya team of Michi-
gan State University researchers has
been making its rounds through the
news circuit with some variation of
the headline, "Reflexology eases can-
cer symptoms." Currently heralded
by the researchers and various news
outlets as a safe and effective treat-
ment based on this study, reflexol-
ogy is a form of alternative medicine
based on the idea that mechanical
stimulation of specific points on the
surface of the feet will relieve stress,
reduce pain and restore one's "ener-
gy balance" via undiscovered path-
ways that run throughout all major
organs in the body.
For this particular study, nearly
400 patients with advanced-stage
breast cancer were divided into three
groups and received one of three
therapies, in addition to their chemo-
therapy and/or hormonal therapy: a
specialized reflexology treatment, a
foot massage by a caregiver or con-
ventional nursing care. Based on
interviews conducted during the
weeks before and after treatment,
the researchers found that dyspnea
- shortness of breath - and overall
physical functioning of the reflexol-
ogy group were improved more than
the conventional care group.
What has been left out of all
reports of this story thus far are
the other results the authors found

which included no significant dif-
ferences in , health-related qual-
ity of life, symptoms of depression
or anxiety, pain and nausea relief.
Furthermore, the group of women
that received a regular foot mas-
sage showed a significant improve-
ment in fatigue relief that was not
matched by the group that received
reflexologytechniques. These irreg-
ular findings are typical of reflexol-
ogy and, in fact, systematic reviews
of the entire field have shown that
it's not an effective treatment for
any medical condition.
This is also true of complemen-
tary and alternative medicines as a
whole, where evidence of effective-
ness is nonexistent, inconsistent or
unable to perform better than a pla-
cebo. Yet many of these practices,
including acupuncture, chiroprac-
tic practices, herbal supplementa-
tion and homeopathy seem to be
increasingly sought outby people to
cure what ails them, typically as a
desire to cure the "whole" individ-
ual (mind, body and soul) through
"ancient" and "natural" remedies.
It's easy to understand the line of
reasoning that might lead to such a
desire: if it's been around for a long
time, there must be something to it;
if it's natural, it must not be harm-
ful; if it cures the whole individual,
it will fix me, not my disease.

But the reason such therapies are
able to thrive is because our modern
society is such an amazingly safe
place. Everything from level roads
and clean drinking water to the
mass availability of good food and
medicine has ensured that more
and more of us will die age-related
deaths. This is wonderful news -
we're living as long as humans can
possibly live. Added to the fact that
alternative medicines are gener-
ally so impotent as to not be harm-
ful, the use of the placebo-effective
medicine will continue to rise.
Though a case could be made
for the administration of placebos,
what is inexcusable is pretending
that such treatments work because
of meridians, chakras, toxin remov-
al or bioenergy. It's all nonsense.
While we should commend the
researchers of this study for their
desire to help people, their poor
methodology and reliance on a dis-
proven theoretical structure don't do
any good. Touching someone's feet
has been a sign of charity, humility
and love for millennia.We don'tneed
to embellish these gestures with
mystical language or pseudoscien-
tific claims to treat those around us
with the care they deserve.

gan state Senate's Health Policy
Committee in June about the issue,
said current Michigan regulations
do not allow APRNs to practice
under their own license. Instead,
they must work in collaboration
with physicians who are regularly
pressed for time and could benefit
from greater APRN responsibility.
She added that it has been more
than 30 years since any revisions
have been made to these regula-
tions.
The legislation would allow
APRNs - defined as nurse prac-
titioners, nurse midwives or clini-
cal nurse specialists - to practice
under an independent license
without a physician's supervision.
She noted that the push to pass
i the bill is not an effort to eliminate
collaboration with physicians,
but rather to allow caregivers to
decide when that partnership is

"It's not that we don't like or agree
with collaboration. We think (all
health care professionals) should
be collaborating when they need
to. But they are the ones who pro-
fessionally know when they need
to (collaborate)."
Pohl said the current regulation
system likely adds to the financial
burdens of health systems because
patientsmay be seen by both a phy-
sician and an APRN; which takes
time and isn't always necessary.
She added that data shows the
current requirements are not
based on evidence that APRNs
lack the necessary education to
make decisions about prescribing
medication or other elements of
practicing.
Pohl said all careers the bill

a high rate of patient satisfaction.
Pohl said the bill is particularly
important as more aspects of the
Affordable Care Act will be imple-
mented next year. She said regula-
tions that increase the standard of
patient care are a priority, since
the shortage of health care profes-
sionals is not expected to improve
quickly.
"You want regulations that
protect patients, but the current
regulations really don't do that,"
she said.
She added that there is no evi-
dence supporting the fact that
patients in Michigan get better
care than they would in a state
with more progressive regulations
of ARPNs.
"We think this would be a real
opportunity to increase access to
care," Pohl said.
Subway located at 902 State St.
next door to R.U.B., said he isn't
worried about the pub's arrival
because he believes Subway
attracts a different crowd.
"We're open until three in the
night and that's when a lot of
people come," Meyei said.
Mitchell said he gets as many
as a dozen inquiries a day about
the restaurant's opening and
that students seem excited about
the smokehouse. Rackham stu-
dent Megan Williams confirmed
that she believes the restaurant
will do well with the collegiate
crowd.
"That area could always use
more restaurants," Williams
said. "I think that for me, I really
like barbecue, and also that it's
the kind of food, especially lately,
that's becoming more and more
popular."
were familiar with the Univer-
sity as a hub for international stu-

"Usually people who are inter-

know about Michigan," Kim said.
Engineering sophomore Mihir
Sheth, who hails from India,
chose to study at the University
instead of regional universities in
India for the cooler climate and
small-town vibe. He added that
he has no regrets with the deci-
sion and finds it is easy to relate
with other international stu-
dents on campus.
"People are really friendly
here; especially when they're
going through the same things,"
Sheth said. "People don't care if
you're international or not."

the report featured LSA fresh-
man Nick Rinehart, who was
the first recipient of the Chris
Armstrong scholarship, which
rewards LGBT student advo-
cates and activists in honor of the
University's first openly gay stu-
dent body president.
Rinehart said the University
is more welcoming to diversity
compared to his high school in
Rochester, Mich.
"I think it's a very big change
for me, coming from a conserva-
tive area, where the administra-
tion was more fighting against
you and trying to stop what you
wanted to do rather than encour-
aging diversity and anti-discrim-
ination policies," Rinehart said.
He added that he has not faced
discrimination while attending
the University.
"I think the University has
been doing a very good job with
promoting diversity and having
as many programs as possible to
help it," he said. "I have never
come across issues with discrim-
ination or anything."
Sharp said students should
feel proud to be a part of such a
uniquely diveirse campus.
"The Michigan community
should actually be proud," Sharp
said. "Out of all those schools,
Michigan has been able to show
how they have a stronger com-
mitment to diversity than those
other schools do right now."



"We mourn our late leader
who walked the path of jihad
while he knew the end, either
victory or martyrdom," Haniyeh
said. "There is no fear among our
people and our resistance, and
ye will face this vicious attack."
In the interview, Chodoff
defended Israel's military action,
and said Israel did not want
to intensify its attacks but the
country could no longer with-
stand rocket fire.
"We have no particular inter-
est in escalating," Chodoff said.
"In fact, hundreds of rockets
have been fired and we respond
to them, but there hasn't been a
ground operation since January
2009. There is a point at which
schools are closed, people are not
going to work, and that's aside
from the grand phenomenon of
living under that kind of stress."
In Gaza and southern Israel,
civilians have been preparing for
a prolonged battle. Palestinians
in the Gaza Strip, which Hamas
has controlled since 2006, are
stocking up on food and fuel as
Israel expressed willingness to
send ground troops into the ter-
ritory if necessary.

The result of the military
action Wednesday could be a
short-term exchange, Chodoff
said.
The attacks on Wednesday
broke an informal four-year
peace agreement between Israel
and Hamas.
Chodoff called the airstrike
that killed Jabari Wednesday a
calculated act of war. He said it
was not random but the result of
aligning circumstances and the
continuation of Israel's attempt
to assassinate Hamas's top lead-
ership.
"It's not random, but coin-
cidence of the right observers
and the right intelligence and
he being in a place where he
could be gotten," Chodoff said of
Jabari. "Those are all the things
that you don't know in advance
and today was the day."
Chodoff said it is unclear how
long fighting could last, and
when it ends Egypt could be a
serviceable intermediary for
negotiations between Israel and
Hamas.

students and will take priority in
the decision process.
"Our goal is really to provide
a nice complementary set of
.options down in the (basement of
the Union)," Pile said. "We don't
want to have a vendor that's com-
peting directly with another ven-
dor. I think that would actually
limit options for students."
Pile also said the seating adja-
cent to the food vendors in the
area near Wendy's and Subway
will be renovated. According to
her, improvements will be made
to seating, lighting, architectural
elements and floring.
"If you go down there now it's
pretty dark... it feels a little dated,
a little enclosed," Pile said. "We
can actually get ... a vaulted ceil-
ing and some lighting that'll be
much improved. Maybe some
different types of seating ... some
counter-top or high-top seating,
or a nice long community table."
Laura Seagram, a market-
ing communications specialist
for University Unions, said the
expected cost of the renovations
is still unknown because design
and engineering plans are not
finalized. She added that the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents is not
required to approve the choice of
vendors in the Union, but will be
kept informed through E. Roys-
ter Harper, the University's vice
president for student affairs.
The Union has made healthy
eating a priority in the search.
Seagram said nutrition stan-
dards will play a prominent role
in the decision making process.
"Another thing we are ask-
ing all of the applicants to bring
forth is their healthy options,
even an expansion of what they
may have now, because that's
really important on campus,"
Seagram said. "The whole point
is to have a balance of options."
Keith Soster, the food ser-
vice director for the University
Unions, said student feedback
has indicated that the Unions
should provide more seasonal
selections, which he hopes will
come to fruition in the Market-
cafd.
"It's more than a coffee shop
or a cafe per se, and we wantit to
have that market atmosphere,"
Soster said. "... Envision a deli
case with a fresh array of salads
fixings and then you can have
your salad prepared right there
for you. or you can have a grab-
and-go type option."
LSA senior Archana Bharad-
waj, the chair of the Michigan

Union Board of Representatives,
said incorporating more locally
grown and nutritional produce
into Union food options was a
priority for the student board.
"I think these changes will
be really reflective of what we,
as students, want to see in the
Union," Bharadwaj said.
LSA senior' Caroline Can-
ning, the vice chair of the Board
of Representatives and the
president of LSA Student Gov-
ernment, said she and other com-
mittee members want to make
the Union more unique to the
University, and they are excited
about the upcoming changes.
"The finishes that we're look-
ing at are things that are more
modernized but also a more
timeless sort of feeling," Canning
said. "If we wanted to renovate
more of that downstairs area, we
could continue using the tiles and
using the same wall fixtures ... to
make it look cohesive."
It is unknown whether the food
vendors in the Michigan League
or the Pierpont Commons will also

change. Seagram said the changes
are a model for the Division of Stu-
dent Affairs to potentially follow
in the residencehalls.
"We're all trying to meet the
needs of students as best as we
can as the chances present them-
selves," Seagram said
Kinesiology junior Alexandra-
Putich said she never buys food
from Union vendors because
they aren't particularly accom-
modating to her nutrition needs.
"I'm gluten free ... so I know
they don't serve those options
here," Putich said. "If they
accommodated those kinds of
things I'd be more likely to eat
here."
LSA senior Ryan Marina said
he eats at the Union about once
every two months, but he would
be interested and more likely
to eat there if ethnic food were
available.
"I mainly get the feel that it's
fast food down here," Marina
said. "Maybe something else
would spice it up."

could you run your 40-meter dash
at the scouting combine if you
weren'twearing a suit?
RE: Well, I don't know and I
don't intend to find out, because
I only run it the one way I know
how, and that's slow and in my
uniform - the suit. I feel like the
whole endeavor would jump the
shark if I actually put on running
clothes. I don't think anybody
really wants to see that, I'm con-
cerned people may not even want
to see my run in a suit anymore.
But Denard best watch out
when I see him in February when
he comes out for the scouting
combine. I suggest he lace 'em
up for that one. When he runs at
the combine, I'll be there, and I'll
be breaking six seconds this year.
I'm working on my core, I'm men-
tally prepared and I have my suit
already picked out. I'm focused,
and I understand Shoelace is fast,
but I have straight-ahead speed.

FOOTBALL
Robinson boo-boo
hinders Iowa's prep

Kwiatkowski blazes walk-on trail

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Maybe there is something to
this boo-boo business.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
has declined to give any sort of
update on senior quarterback
Denard Robinson's status against
Iowa. And that's at least a bit of
an obstacle for
the Hawkeyes, NOTEBOOK
according to
coach Kirk Ferentz.
Hoke's refusal to provide any
information regarding Robinson
has produced some interesting
explanations. Last week, Hoke
said he would stop giving updates
on Robinson and redshirt fresh-
man quarterback Russell Bellomy
"in fairness to those kids." Ever
since, Hoke has favored the term
"day-to-day." On Monday, even
the potential for disappointment
if Robinson couldn't play was
deemed "day-to-day."
Ferentz said that means his
team must spend time preparing
for two quarterbacks.
"Hoke said it was a day-to-day
thing, which we understand that
totally," Ferentz said in a press
conference. He chuckled quietly,
then added, "You gotta be ready
for both. ... It's a little bit tricky
because you have two prepara-
tions. They're not that much dif-
ferent, but they're not the same
either. So it's two different prepa-
rations and both of them are tough
preparations."
Both Robinson and junior
quarterback Devin Gardner have
earned Big Ten player of the week
honors this year after Gardner
won it for his performance against
Northwestern last week. Though
both signal-callers are similar in
the sense that they are dual-threat
quarterbacks, Ferentz noted that.
Michigan typically has more
designed runs with Robinson in
the game.
His players also said their

approach to the game differs
depending on who plays quarter-
back l r the Wolverines. Mostly,
it was Robinson's electric running
ability that posed the biggest chal-
lenges. Iowa defensive back Micah
Hyde said of Robinson, "when you
talk about Michigan's offense, you
gotta start with him."
Iowa defensive tackle Steve Big-
ach said that with Robinson in the
game, the defense has to treat the
Wolverines' offense as a two-back
set, with Robinson as an extra
running back. That forces Iowa to
put more defenders in the box.
"It's definitely dangerous," Big-
ach said. "It adds an extra element
to the game."
On Monday, Hoke added anoth-
er element of uncertainty. When
one reporter asked whether Rob-
inson would be available in a non-
throwing role if his injured elbow
healed enough to play, Hoke of
course revealed nothing certain.
"I guess I'll talk to him about
that day to day," he said.
HUT, HUT, HUH?: Borges
was mum on the reasons behind
Michigan's newfound propensity
to draw the opposing team off-
side with Gardner under center.
The Wolverines have induced five
encroachment flags with Gardner
as the starter.
That's a pretty significant devi-
ation from the average number of
offsides penalties.
Borges declined to say whether
this was simply an effective hard
count by Gardner or whether it
was by design.
"I won't answer that question,"
Borges said. "It's too -- tells too
much."
Follwing Saturday's victory
over Northwestern, redshirt
junior Taylor Lewan said plays are
called to draw teams offsides.
"That's a situation we've gone
over a lot of times, and we have
packages we put in every once in
a while for different teams to keep
them on their toes," Lewan said.

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
Mike Kwiatkowski wasn't sup-
posed to make it this far.
The fifth-year senior tight end
admits that much himself. As a
senior at Dakota High School in
Macomb, Mich., Kwiatkowski
was only recruitedto play football
by Division-II schools.
Though he ended up choosing
to attend the University of Michi-
gan due to the school's strong
academics, Kwiatkowski never
thought he'd end up on the foot-
ball team. When he pushed his
way up to somewhere around the
fifth row of Michigan Stadium as
a fan during his first two years at
the school, he thoughtcthat was as
close to the field as he'd ever get.
Yet here is Kwiatkowski, pre-
paring to play his final game at
the BigHouse on Saturday, joined
by 22 other seniors, most of them
much more than ballyhooed than
he ever was.
It's fine to recognize how
unlikely it is that Kwiatkowski
rose from regular student to
scholarship starter in a matter of
three years - but don't call him a
walk-on.
"I actually despise that label,"
Kwiatkowski said. "Because like
you said, there's been a number
of (walk-ons) who have played,
and just because you weren't
given a scholarship doesn't mean
you aren't as capable. Obviously,
there's some exceptions to that, of
people who walk on and don't end
up playing.
"I guess that's the rule, if any-
thing."
Kwiatkowski has managed to
break that rule. When he arrived
at Michigan in 2008, he ignored
former high school teammate
Ricky Reyes, then a redshirt
junior walk-on himself, who
prodded him to try out for the
team right then and there.
Two years later, Kwiatkowski
was checking the Athletic Depart-
ment website to see how an exam
for a genetics class matched up
with the football schedule. He
noticed a blurb about open try-

outs - one of several suc

guez in his three season

Kwiatkowski's role has only
increased.
He's started sixofthe team's 10
games, and the fifth-year senior
has been the most reliable blocker
at the position. He's also man-
aged to record three catches, the
first coming in the season opener
against Alabama.
Kwiatkowski's relative lack
of accolades hasn't discouraged
him from helping out the younger
tight ends as much as possible,
a trait that earned him compli-
ments from Hoke. And the dearth
of credentials hasn't made him
any lesser part of the team - nor
has it endeared him any less to his
fellow seniors.
"I think it's what makes it spe-
cial, and I think it's what makes
a lot of us close, is we've all had
different experiences," said fifth-
year senior center Elliott Mealer.
"We got guys like Mike and Jor-

on the team only for a couple
years. They're all seniors, and

"(Being walk-ons) doesn't take
away from anything that they've
put into this program. It feels like
they've been a part ofit the whole
time since I've been here."
And yet it can't be denied that
Kwiatkowski's journey to this
Saturday's senior day was a very
different one from the rest of the
seniors.
"When I first got here, I never
expected this day to come," Kwi-
atkowski said. "The first game I
dressed for was Michigan State,
and I was just happy to be out
there. I had no foresight of think-
ing three years in the future, I'd

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
 Barnes Arico inks first
recruiting class for 'M'

By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer.
One of the biggest challenges
for any first-year coach is to make
an immediate impact on recruit-
ing for the future. It's especially
difficult for coaches who are hired
mid-way through the offseason,
like Michigan's women's basket-
ball coach Kim Barnes Arico, since
they have ^ late entrance into the
sweepstakes for national talent.
But once she arrived in Ann
Arbor, it didn't take long for
Barnes Arico to get out on the
recruiting trail and start build-
ing a roster for the 2013-14 sea-
son. On Wednesday, Barnes Arico
announced that high schoolers
Paige Rakers, Shannon Smith,
Siera Thompson and Danielle Wil-
liams had signed National Letters
of Intent with Michigan. As the
first four recruits of the Barnes
Arico era, the quartet brings an
exceptional amount of talent and
experience from AAU programs
and high school teams. The new-
est additions to the Wolverines'
roster provide depth at the guard
position, which will help replace
the offensive production lost from
this year's seniors Jenny Ryan,
Rachel Scheffer, Nya Jordan, Kate
Thompson and SamArnold.
Rakers, a 5-foot-11 guard from
Carlyle," Ill., is an outstanding
shooter who averaged 19.4 points
per game on 44-percent shooting
in her junior year of high school.
After leading her team to the title
game of the Class 2-A Regional,
Rakers finished the year with a
team-best 52 steals and 49 assists.
Last year, she won the Illinois
High School Association's state-
wide 3-point shooting, earning
the name "Queen of the HilL." In
addition to leading her high school
team, Rakers also competes on
Team Adidas, an AAU team based
out of St. Louis.
Smith will transfer to Michigan
from Trinity Valley Community
College after spending two red-
shirt seasons at North Carolina.
After a medical redshirt sidelined
Smith her freshman year, she
averaged three points and 13 min-

utes per game. With two years of
eligibility remaining, Smith will
provide her scoring talents and
experience of playing in Division
I. The 5-foot-7 guard was heavily
recruited out of high school, earn-
ing the Associated Press women's
prep co-player ofthe year in North
Carolina during the 2009-10
season. Averaging 23 points and
seven assists per game, Smith led
Forestview High School to the 3-A
state title. She finished her high
school career as the leadingscorer
in Forestview and Gaston County
history, and was named North
Carolina's Miss Basketball in 2010.
The Wolverines' top-ranked
commit is Thompson, who ESPN
graded as the 68th-best player
in the nation and 15th-best point
guard. The Gardena, Calif. native
averaged 11 points, 4.9 assists and
4.4 rebounds in her junior year,
while leading Serra to three con-
secutive section championships.
Thompson also plays for AAU's
highly regarded Cal Sparks.
Rounding out the incoming
class is Williams, a 5-foot-9 guard
ranked 97th in the nation and 28th
at her position by ESPN. Williams
helped lead St. Mary's to the Divi-
sion I Arizona state championship
while completing an undefeated
30-0 season. In 2012, St. Mary's
reached the national champion-
ship and earned the No. 1 ranking
in the ESPN/USA Today poll.
"I have had the opportunity to
watch Danielle play since she has
been in the seventh grade," Barnes
Arico said. "I have watched her
progress and develop ...Hercoach,
Curtis Ekmark, he has done a phe-
nomenal job with her and making
his program one of the best in the
country. Once I got the job here,
knowing the academic piece was
so important for her and her fam-
ilyhe knew it would be a great fit."
Barnes Arico's first four com-
mits are expected to be just the
start for Michigan's recruit-
ing process. The Wolverines are
already planning to take a foreign
trip during next summer's off-
season, which should allow the
rookies some extra time to adjust
before practices start in the fall.

Each character is fantastically
flawed, human and imperfect. If
you didn't dislike each charac-
ter at some point, you've done an
injustice in reading the novel.
My unhappiness stems from
the overtly ungratifying depths
to which the characters sink

I've been a fool while muddling

difficult to imagine a scenario
in which, after witnessing my
ungrateful, unfaithful true love

for me to imagine a time in which
I would take a mistress, find her
struck dead and promptly take

People are irrational. They
are fearful and uncertain, but
more often than not, the imme-
diate need for self preservation
kicks in. Furthermrnr, the desire
to have and to own supersedes
the desire to please. Had Daisy
chosen Gatsby, I'd understand
his reaction. Had Daisy not
slept with Gatsby, I'd under-
stand Tom's reaction. But I can't,
and the novel feels incomplete:
like something that had all the
workings to be phenomenal, but
instead falls right before the big
jump. It feels like a cop-out to
watch Gatsby die without con-
fronting Daisy. It feels wrong to
watch Nick be a casual bystander
who doesn't interfere, but has all
the opinions.
The novel, as a piece of lit-
erature, is phenomenally writ-
ten. Fitzgerald is a master of
language, and it shows in each
sentence. But the rationale, the
logic behind the novel, is inher-
ently harder to understand. It
doesn't have to be cut and dry.
I don't mind analyzing motives,
I don't mind accepting that cer-
tain characters are more flawed
than others. I do mind making
excuses for characters: witness-
ing them make mistakes that
seem forced.

Into the future
The 2012 annual includes
significant updates on the cabin
itself, which recently received
$130,000 worth in renovations
funded by LV alumni. Completed
last summer, renovations includ-
ed an expansion of the entire
cabin to create more floor space
accompanied by new hardwood
floors, new heating systems and
a brand new kitchen.
McNair was a huge compo-
nent in the renovations. He is
one of the two members on the
society's advisory board, over-
seeing the officers and providing
support with upkeep of the lodge
and ensuring the continuity of
LV traditions.
When the lodge transitioned
from serving solely as a meeting
house to becoming a home for
members, indoor plumbing and
an indoor kitchen were 'added,
but those were the exceptions
- the cabin hadn't really been
updated since it was built in
1926, McNair said.
The alumni-funded renova-
tions hearken back to the prin-
ciples former LVs supported as
actives, many years ago.
"Les Voyageurs is not some-
thing you do for four years and
then graduate," Bonadonna said.
"You're a voyageur for life."
From financial contributions
to tutorials on how to use a com-
pass properly, LVs are always
around.
McNair is still very active out-
doors, and sees alums at many
LV events who he has kept in
touch with.
"We want to maintain a huge
family," Bonadonna said. "If you
need somethingthey're there for
you."
The everlasting, idiosyncratic
friendships specific to Les Voya-
geurs are felt when members
come together, especially when
alums are around, Alexander
said.
"It's one big friendship," she
said. "We'll have people come
back who graduated last -year
and also people who graduated
in 1960 and we get along so well,
it's easy."
Bonadonna has no doubt that
she'll keep in touch with fellow
LVs and probably travel with
them in the future.
"We have this thing that con-
nects us," she said. "And we
always can come back to the
cabin, it'll always be here."
After Alexander, Bonadonna
and other Les Voyageurs gradu-
ate, the traditions that glue the
society together will continue.
They'll come back as alumni
for Old Timers' Night and teach
actives the skills they learned
when they were at the Univer-
sity.
And just as they did before
every meal together, they'll sing

the same song that's been sung
for more than 100 years.

University alum Sarah Gibson
acts as creative director for Ella
Sven, which involves creating
the ideas for the photo shoots
and designing the sets.
Moreover, Gibson helped ini-
tiate Ella Sven's photo shoots in
unpopulated areas of Detroit.
"You see the abandoned
building, see the beautiful mold-
ing and you transform it to make
it beautiful," Gibson said.
Swenson added that the city
serves as a great background
for her garments because they
fit the "tousled glamour" of the
clothing line.
"There's something really
offbeat about the fact that we're
shooting in abandoned Detroit,
in buildings that are falling
apart," Swenson said. "There's
something disheveled and dis-
torted about that."
Though Swenson plans to
continue shooting her line in
Detroit, she doesn't plan to stay
in Michigan forever. Her long-
term goal is to open a store in
New York and eventually sup-
ply other stores with a similar
vision.
Hoping to build a "fashion
empire," she said: "You can have
good-quality merchandise that's
responsibly made for the same
price as clothes that aren't."
She calls this idea "fashion for a
cause."
Her more immediate plans are
to add nearly 1,000 new items
online, she said. While most cur-
rent garments are smaller sizes,
Swenson said that the new items
will range in size and style.
Whether it's in her impend-
ing collection or any future gar-
'"' _nents, Swenson explained she
will keep the clothes "at a high
fashion level where it doesn't
look recycled" Through her
use of old-world craftsmanship,
Swenson wants to redefine the
fashion industry.
"The fact that there could be a
company that offers everything,
and at the high fashion level with
COURTESY OF ILASVEs old world craftsmanship, that's
what I want," Swenson said.

Position-by-position Michigan roster breakdown

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan men's basketball
team has one of its most talented
squads in recent memory, which
means there are roster options
aplenty.
Here's a breakdown of this sea-
son's roster:
Point Guard: After sophomore
Trey Burke was suspended for
the first exhibition of the sea-
son against Northern Michigan,
freshman Spike Albrecht was
thrust into a starting role that
no one expected him to occupy.
Albrecht impressed, scoring 16
points with six assists in his col-
legiate debut against the Wildcats.
After the game, Michigan
coach John Beilein joked that
even though Albrecht played well,
there would be no point guard
controversy. That's what happens
when the starter is a preseason
All-American.
Still, having Albrecht on the
roster will be crucial for the
team's depth, especially during
Big Ten play. Burke averaged just
over 36 minutes a game last year,
partially because the Wolverines
didn't have another true point
guard they could rely on. Burke
had to play.
It's a little different this sea-
son now that there is a legitimate
backup option in Ann Arbor. Burke
will get his minutes, but there will
undoubtedly be games in January
and February when Burke will
need a couple minutes to get off
the court and rest. Albrecht - a
solid ball-handler coming off the
bench - might play fewer than 10
minutes a game, but an important
10 minutes nonetheless.
Guard/Forward: The shooting
guard might be the only start-
ing position that could change
between now and Big Ten season.
After two exhibitions and two
regular season games, the starter
has been senior Matt Vogrich. His
role offensively isn't that com-
plicated - he's the shooter in the
corner with no slashing responsi-
bilities.
But so far, Vogrich hasn't been
shooting at the level of someone

things could get interesting,
because this is arguably the best
big-man talent that Beilein has
ever had. While the combinations
of bigs could change depending on
what offensive mood he is in, the
starting forwards will almost cer-
tainly be Glenn Robinson III and
Jordan Morgan.
The lone freshman starter is
Robinson, who is a combination
of a guard and forward in Beilein's
four-guard offense. He is a 6-foot-
6 offensive weapon who can shoot
as well as he can drive, and a
leaper who has already been at the
receiving end of several alley-oops
from Burke and Hardaway.
The big man on the court is
Morgan, the 6-foot-8 redshirt
junior who will be counted for all
things interior - scoring, defense
and rebounding.
Behind the two starters are
where the combinations become
intriguing. Freshman Mitch
McGary has been coming off the
bench to replace Morgan about
five minutes into every game. The
freshman is 6-foot-10 and has a
ton of talent, albeit raw talent. The
coaching staff will help him devel-
op until he sees more and more of
the floor.
McGary is naturally more of a
center, but he can also play for-
ward..If Beilein wants to turn his
team from small to big very quick-
ly, he inserts McGary into the
forward role alongside Morgan,
which he has at times already this
season. Having a 6-foot-10 power
forward is an interesting lineup
maneuver that Beilein could look
into against certain, bigger teams
down the road. The other variable
among the bigs is Jon Horford, the
talented redshirt sophomore who
is coming off an injury-shortened
2011-12 season because of a stress
fracture in his foot. Horford and
McGary could play together, or
Horford and Morgan could play
together, to create another two-
big lineup.
Point is, this roster could go big
or smal depending on the oppos-
ing team and Beilein's mood,
which should be exciting for any-
body looking for points this sea-
son at the Crisler Center.

Freshman guard Nik Stauskas has been red-hot from deep in the first few games in a Michigan basketball uniform.

whose only job is to shoot. He's
4-for-16 from deep if you count the
two exhibition games, and while
he is a hustler and plays solid
defense, his role is to shoot.
The guy behind him right now
is freshman Nik Stauskas, who
might be billed as one of the most
prolific shooters in Michigan his-
tory by the time his career is over.
Through two games, he's shoot-
ing 70-percent from deep, and
while that number will certainly

decrease, it's fair to say the Cana-
dian will lead the team in 3-point
percentage.
Vogrich has more experience
and is a better defender than
Stauskas at this point, but by the
time Big Ten play rolls around,
don't be surprised if it's the fresh-
man instead of the senior in the
starting lineup.
The small forward will be Tim
Hardaway Jr., who has looked
like the Wolverines' most com-

plete player in this young season.
Whatever Hardaway did in the
off-season is paying off so far, as.
the junior has already looked bet-
ter on defense, in rebounding and
in distributing the ball than he
did last year. On a team with more
offensive weapons all over the
roster, Hardaway isn't going to be
relied upon as much for scoring,
and a more complete Hardaway is
a good thing for Michigan.

This way, Beilein couldleverage the one posi-
tion in which Michigan had the edge in physi-
cality, whereby Morris could attack smaller
defenders and spread the court for the team's
shnoters.
Follnwing the humiliating loss to Minnesota
in Jan. 2011, the Wolverines curbed a six-game
losing streak and won nine of their next 12.
They earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament
and won their first game in convincing fashion,
75-45 over Tennessee.
"I think he learns how to be more flexible

he has," Morris said
last week. "He might

phy and the morals
that he instills in his

Many thought
Morris's early
departure for the
NBA meant doom
and gloom for Mich-
igan for the foresee-
able future. What
they couldn't have
realized was that the

Beilein had the
task of integrating Freshman forward Mitch M
a freshman point
guard into a team with seniors Novak and Stu
Douglass, who had dreams of makinga lasting
impact in their last year.
So did the coach work extra hourswith Trey
to teach him all of the intricacies of his offense
so that he could command the system by Big
Ten play in January? Quite the opposite.
"What we did do, because that's the tough-
est position to come into, is we shortened our
package in games," Beilein said. "We tried
to work on our package for the future, but
we shortened our package for him in games
because it would be too much for him."
The plan seemed to work. Burke led the
team in scoring and assists, was named Big
Ten Freshman of the Year and earned the com-
plete respect of his teammates.

Burke led the team to its.first BigTen cham-

"We all came here with some different ideas.
and John filters the best of them," said assis-
tant coach LaVall Jordan. "He's always think-
ing about the strengths of the team to get us in
the best position."
Burke's season earned him national acclaim
and preseason All-America honors this year.
But that success almost came at the expense of
the Wolverines' success this season.
News came out shortly after Michigan
bowed out in the first game of the NCAA

on his players for four years. Now, there's a
tradeoff. The better his players become, the
better his teams will be - but long-term suc-
cess is placed in jeopardy as the allure of
money and fame in the NBA is too much for a
college student to ignore.
In all but one of Beilein's seasons at Michi-
gan, an underclassman has led the team in

flourished in the system, and the. NBA came
calling for each of them. This wasn't Canisius

"With Manny and Darius and now our cur-

said. "And if they're in a position to move to

But other things need to stay the same.
"We adjust to the players," Beilein said. "But
there's certain things that are not negotiable.
You're going to be a good teammate, you're
goingto be in a (defensive) stance, you're going
to buy into defense."
The rise of Michigan basketball and the
growing presence of top-flight talent in Crisler
Center might follow an easily constructed nar-
rative.
Beilein came to
Michigan, a higher-
profile program and
made use of rapidly
improving facilities
and culture to attract
some of the best bas-
ketball talent in the
country on the way to

If only it worked
that easily.
More likely was
that Beilein didn't
just begin to attract

He developed

Burke said. "But then
he'll get on you if you're doing something that
you're not capable of doing. The players love
playing for him because he's a players' coach.
He allows his players to make mistakes."
Morris says high schoolers with dreams of
playing in the NBA ought to heavily consider
Michigan.
Twenty-five years after Hicks at Le Moyne,
the styles of Beilein's teams have varied. Ear-
lier teams were slower and operated mainly in
the half-court.
This year's athletically superior group fig-
ures to run much more in the open court, but
the principles stay the same.
The underdoglabel for Beilein's offense may
have been shed, but the tenets of the offense
stay constant. Find the open man.

about entering the NBA Draft. On April 4, CBS
Spotts reported that Burke was indeed leaving

Wolverines would be able to deal with losing
their underclassman point guard for the sec-
ond straight year. in a year that seemed to be a
big step forward for Michigan, Burke's depar-
ture would beckon a rebuildingyear.

Certainthings change when Beilein has this

the program once the NBA guy has moved on.
He needs to take advantage of the late

goals of the program align with the individu-

Michigan's Youth Revolution
Neal Rothschild I1Daily Sports Editor

For a man with more talent than he's
ever had in 35 years of coaching, John
Beilein doesn't feel spoiled.
The sixth-year Michigan coach constructed
and perfected an offense with the purpose of
doing more with less, but today Beilein doesn't
have less. He has more than opposing coaches
feel comfortable with.
He has the top-flight talent he could once
see only by scheduling a marquee opponent
when he was laboringthrough the lower rungs
of college basketball.
These days?
Tim Hardaway Jr. Trey Burke. Mitch
McGary. Glenn Robinson IIt. The future is
in place too: heralded recruits Derrick Wal-
ton and Zak Irvin both signed their letters of
intent for the 2013 recruiting class this week.
At the center is Burke. Without the sopho-
more from Columbus, the bridge from Darius
Morris to the future of Michigan basketball
may not have been built.
Burke is the quarterback of Beilein's pres-
ent-day offense, the 2012 iteration of the floor
general that Beilein's always had, but never

like this - a lightning-quick, no-look passing,
jump-shooting, off-balance-finishing dynamo.
Beilein's rosters used to be inundated with
blue-collar talent. Now, you'll have a tough
time finding a team of his devoid of NBA tal-
ent. Very quickly, Beilein's teams went from
the pursuers to the pursued.
And in the process, the face of Beilein's
teams has transformed. Where there once was
the savvy, but limited senior leader, now is the
stud underclassman with the talent to make it
to the next level.
But through this transformation, Beilein
hasn't changed his attitude. He doesn't feel
spoiled because nothing he touches is differ-
ent. The expectations are the same, the atti-
tude is the same, and the respect he commands
is the same.
Therein lies the paradox of Beilein: noth-
ing has changed about how he approaches his
teams - but the constant is that he won't stop
changing.

Before he won a Big Ten championship,
reached the Elite Eight at West Virginia or
groomed NBA-level talent, John Beilein had
Scott Hicks in 1987.
The guard for Le Moyne College in upstate
New York had the height Beilein liked, but
lacked quickness to keep up with opposing
guards.
So Beilein tinkered. He plugged the under-
sized Hicks in as a stretch forward, and Le
Moyne won 16 out of 17 games that season, fin-
ishing 24-6.
If that sounds familiar, it should. History
repeated itself 23 years and four coaching
stops later when Beilein used an athletically
limited, 6-foot-4 scrapper as the undersized
forward. Zack Novak flourished in the role and
captained Michigan for three years, leading
the Wolverines to consecutive NCAA Tourna-
ments for the first time since the Steve Fisher
era.
But to conclude that the undersized power
forward is a Beilein trademark would be to look
liiiitedly at the players he's had. West Virgin-
ia's six-foot-11 Kevin Pittsnogle took the nation

by storm during March Madness in 2005. The
tattooed 3-point sharpshooter played the same
position as Novak, just as the versatile 6-foot-8
DeShawn Sims did at Michigan.
"We have to adapt to our players," says
Beilein. "Because Jordan Morgan, for exam-
. ple, is not a 3-point shooter. You tailor the
game to him. That's the beauty of our staff and
our experience level. We're going to tailor our
plan to what our talent level is."
Novak's departure, though, may have sig-
naled a farewell to the legacy of the Beilein
Overachiever. He was Burke's first running
mate and came at the intersection of John
Beilein old and new. He represented the
Beilein of the past, who found himself on a
team rapidly becoming the Beilein team of the
future.
Novak may be the last of a dying breed. As
Beilein's status continues to climb in college
basketball, he won't need to rely on the self-
made, "small-town boy makes good" mold.
Why try to catch lightning in a bottle when you
can create it yourself? Beilein, able to get his
pick of the litter of high school talent, will be

able to customize his teams based on current
and future personnel.
Where the Novak archetype may be falling
out of favor, the other pieces still need to be
there to surround Burke. The stretch swing-
man - a versatile, inside-outside threat with
the ability to rebound and guard opposing
power forwards - is filled by the 6-foot-6 Rob-
inson. That spot-up shooter who can bury the
big 3-pointer from the corner? Freshman Nik
Stauskas. Hardaway is the athletic wing player.
Morgan, and eventually McGary, plays the role
of the steady big man to clean up around the
rim.
It's as though, after 35 years of coaching,
Beilein finally has his fantasy lineup.
That offense Beilein developed at Le Moyne
became a trademark. He'd overcome bigger
and more athletic teams with ball movement,
screening and backdoor cuts. The offense was
made to find the open man, not the five-star
recruit - mainly because he didn't have one.

It was an underdog system through and
through. But before he developed it in the late
'80s, he led unheralded programs at Erie Com-
munity College and Nazareth to dominant sea-
sons. Once he broke into the Division-I ranks,
he led Canisius College to its best record in the
last 55 years. He coached Richmond to five-
straight winning seasons and he took West
Virginia to the Elite Eight, a height the Moun-
taineers hadn't reached since 1959.
At West Virginia, Beilein turned the pro-
gram around, but not because of the freakish
talent. His first top-100 recruit was Da'Sean
Butler who signed in Beilein's last year in Mor-
gantown. It was a school that had been to the
NCAA Tournament just twice since 1989, but
has missed the tournament just twice since
Beilein arrived in 2004.
Then, as he brought Michigan back from the
brink of NCAA basketball irrelevance, a funny
thing happened.
Suddenly, the Wolverines started to enjoy
the size and athleticism that they'd been
designed to take down. The alley-oops, spin
moves and tip-slams started to infiltrate

Crisler Center. Now, they're pulling in the top-
flight recruits.
Manny Harris was inherited by Beilein
from former coach Tommy Amaker and was
developed into an NBA talent. In the 2010-11
season, Morris went from a standard Big Ten
point guard to a Los Angeles Laker. The fol-
lowing year, Burke went from alightly recruit-
ed three-star from Columbus to a probable
second-rounder in the NBA Draft.
This begs the question whether Beilein
has attracted a much better crop of players,
or whether the players reached NBA caliber
because of their time under Beilein.
According to Beilein, the NBA wasn't on
Burke nor Morris's radar early in their break-
out seasons.
"There is no way that ir January, or even
February of Trey's freshman year and Dari-
us's sophomore year they were even thinking
of going to the NBA," Beilein said. "If you're
thinking aboutgoing to the NBA in December,
you probably won't be going to the NBA."

Michigan had one of its youngest rosters
in 2010-11, Morris's sophomore season. There
were no seniors and there was a serious void
in size.
This was the pre-windfall Beilein team. The
last glimpse of the not-quite-there era. Burke
was in his senior season at Northland High
School, and Morris had the reins to the offense.
Morgan was the lone reliable post pres-
ence in his redshirt freshman season, and the
Wolverines lived and died by Morris and the
3-pointer.
In a particularly embarrassing loss to Min-
nesota, Michigan totaled 11 rebounds and the
high on the team belonged to Hardaway and
Novak, who each pulled down three. The Wol-
verine frontcourt amassed a single board.
That season, the 6-foot-4 Novak led the
squad in rebounding.
Size was clearly an issue, so Beilein did what
he had to do. He stationed Morris - his strong,
physical 6-foot-4 point guard - in the post
where Michigan could take advantage of the
traditionally smaller opposing pointguards.
