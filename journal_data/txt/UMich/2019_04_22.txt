About 50 people gathered 
Friday night in the Forum 
Hall of Palmer Commons 
for the 2019 Mental Health 
Monologues, 
sponsored 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
chapter 
of 
Active Minds. This is the 
fourth year Active Minds, 
an 
organization 
dedicated 
to raising awareness about 
mental health among college 
students, has put on the 
show. Students and alumni 
prepared monologues about 
their personal struggles with 
mental health.
Nursing 
junior 
Laura 
Halprin was an organizer 
of the event. She said the 
purpose of the event was to 
humanize to the broad issue 
of mental health by allowing 
people to share their stories. 
“It’s supposed to put real 
faces behind real stories,” 
Halprin said. “As students I 
think it’s really empowering 
to put faces to what we maybe 
just hear in the media.”
Halprin hoped the event 
would 
educate 
people 
on 
what mental health looks like 
and help get rid of the stigma 
often associated with it.
“It 
makes 
things 
more 
personalized and normalized 
for 
the 
experiences 
that 
many people have,” Halprin 
said. “For people who don’t 
necessarily identify as having 
a mental illness, it really 

helps open their eyes to what 
others around them may be 
experiencing and how they 
could potentially play a role 
in helping that.”
LSA junior Jessica Kolbe 
also organized the event, 
and was one of the speakers. 
She wrote an eight-minute 
monologue and performed 
it for the audience, and said 
she wanted her story to help 
normalize her illness.
“I’m just hoping to educate 
people, 
because 
with 
my 
disorder, 
I 
have 
bipolar 
disorder, it’s very stigmatized 
and people fear it a lot,” Kolbe 
said. “So if I can like help 
normalize it, it would just be 
really great. And it’s also just 
empowering to like be there, 
standing in front of other 
people and be like, ‘Yeah, I do 

have this, and I’m a perfectly 
functioning human being.’”
In her monologue, Kolbe 
recounted the details of her 
journey with mental illness 
that led her to where she is 
today. She reflected on how 
far she has come.
“There are no cures for my 
struggles so I will have to 
fight my disorders for the rest 
of my life,” Kolbe said. “But I 
know I will be okay. Life gets 
worse, but it also gets better. 
I have the tools to persevere 
and I will use them.”
Kolbe 
finished 
her 
monologue by discussing her 
hope for the future.
“Although 
there 
is 
no 
happily ever after in this 
story, there are happy times 
in store for me, and I will 
continue to live so I can 

experience them,” Kolbe said.
Engineering freshman Ben 
Firstenberg 
attended 
the 
event to support his friend, 
LSA freshman Jordy Garcia, 
who was one of the speakers. 
Firstenberg hopes the event 
will showcase the seriousness 
of mental illness, as well as 
how it can affect a person’s 
overall health.
“I also think it’s important 
because 
mental 
health 
is 
an important issue today,” 
Firstenberg said. “And I think 
a lot of people should be aware 
of how their mental health 
can 
affect 
their 
physical 
health and their overall well-
being.”

Democratic 
lawmakers 
in 
both chambers of the Michigan 
Legislature proposed a series of 
bills Wednesday that would enact 
protections for LGBT couples when 
adopting children.
The lawmakers behind House 
Bills 4469-4472 and Senate Bills 
272-275 hope to allow same-sex 
parents to adopt their partner’s 
biological or adoptive child, further 
protect same-sex couples from 
discrimination when adopting and 
hold adoption agencies accountable 
for discrimination.
State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 
Arbor, told The Daily he and his 
colleagues proposed the package 
of bills because former Gov. Rick 
Snyder 
signed 
bills 
allowing 
faith-based 
adoption 
agencies 
to 
discriminate 
against 
LGBT 
individuals.
“In 
some 
cases, 
(adoption 
agencies) were using their religious 
beliefs as a rationale to deny adoption 
to certain parents, particularly 
LGBT parents … and parents who 
may be out of the mainstream in any 
number of other ways,” Irwin said.

When Taubman junior Juan 
Muñoz graduated high school 
in 2013, he was unsure how 
to navigate higher education 
financially. Although he resides 
in Michigan, his status as an 
undocumented individual has 
made — and continues to make 
— his ascent into public higher 
education rocky.
The University of Michigan 
has a route for students who 
do not meet the traditional 
residency guidelines to receive 
in-state tuition, according to 
University 
spokesperson 
Kim 
Broekhuizen. In an email to The 
Daily, she wrote that the policy, 
which is called the Attendance 
and Veterans pathways, was 
added in 2014. It allows students 
who 
attend 
middle 
school 

in Michigan for two years, a 
Michigan accredited high school 
for three years and enroll in the 
University within 28 months of 
high school graduation to receive 
in-state tuition. 
This pathway was the result 
of advocacy by the Coalition 
for 
Tuition 
Equality, 
which 
fought for the right of resident 
undocumented 
students 
to 
receive in-state tuition since 
October 2011. The Board of 
Regents 
approved 
the 
new 
guidelines in July 2013, and they 
were put into place in 2014. 
Broekhuizen wrote the 28 
month transition time may have 
been the standard amount of time 
students waited to apply to the 
University in 2014.

Daily surveys 400 undergrads, finds most compare their academic ability to peers

This past semester, The Mich-
igan Daily conducted a survey 
which received close to 400 
responses about the nature of 
imposter syndrome at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. Imposter 
syndrome refers to a psychologi-

cal pattern in which an individual 
dismisses their accomplishments 
and fears being exposed as lack-
ing or just simply a “fraud.” The 
survey included questions that 
asked students to self-report 
their demographics. Demo-
graphics questions that had the 
most significant results included 
income and gender, while oth-

ers such as race did not provide 
conclusive data. The survey was 
intended to gauge how students 
perceived themselves in relation 
to the rest of their peers at the 
University in their respective 
fields of study.
Originally, LSA senior Ciara 
Hancock wanted to attend Alma 
College to train as a cheerlead-

er. In her rural, predominantly 
white, hometown of Charlotte, 
Michigan, Hancock outlined 
two distinct post-high school 
paths: either belonging to the 
top 10 percent that transition 
to college, or falling within the 
other 90 percent that attend a 
trade school.

After getting her ACT scores 
back, Hancock decided to relin-
quish her dreams of back-spotting 
a basket toss and set her sights on 
a more academic path: the Univer-
sity of Michigan. Yet her decision 
was met with hesitation from her 
peers, parents and even her teach-
ers, causing her to fully realize the 
“name that Michigan carries.”
“A lot of the teachers that I came 
across when I told them about 
my plans were kind of like ‘Oh 
wow, really? That’s kind of a reach 
school,’” Hancock said. “Not a lot of 
people from my school move on to 
bigger name schools. An important 
professional at the school pulled me 
aside and told me, ‘I think it’s good 
that you’re going to Michigan, but 
I think you need to be ready and 
aware that you’re going to go from 
being top to the middle or bottom.’ 
It seemed like really good realistic 
advice then, but now that I think 
about it, it feels like it was really dis-
counting. I went to a small school 
where they weren’t prepared to 

prepare to students to strive for 
more. So, I think that kind of set me 
up for feeling a little anxious here.”
Hancock is not the only student 
harboring anxieties about being in 
“the middle or bottom.” Accord-
ing to the survey of 400 students 
conducted by The Michigan Daily, 
87.9 percent of undergraduates said 
they often compare their academic 
ability to those around them.
By 
attending 
a 
university 
ranked fourth in “Best Public Uni-
versities,” 20th in the world for 
research-intensive universities and 
one which routinely generates cap-
tains of industry, Nobel laureates 
and Hollywood elites, Hancock 
wondered: How can you not have 
imposter syndrome?
“You look at that student and 
think, ‘Holy cow, how are you 
so smart? How are you doing so 
much? How are you on the execu-
tive board of six different organiza-
tions?’” Hancock said. “It kind of 
makes you feel like shit. I’m strug-
gling to sometimes remember to 
take a shower.”
The students polled by The 
Daily reported symptoms of impos-
ter syndrome, a term coined by 

psychologists Pauline Clance and 
Suzanne Imes in 1978. Imposter 
syndrome refers to the feeling of 
“phoniness in people who believe 
that they are not intelligent, capable 
or creative despite evidence of high 
achievement.” While these people 
are “highly motivated to achieve,” 
they regularly “live in fear of being 
‘found out’ or exposed as frauds.”
Overall, Hancock said imposter 
syndrome affects her day to day 
life, hindering her ability to suc-
ceed at the University.
“I feel like there has not been 
enough acknowledgement of the 
impact it can have,” Hancock said. 
“I feel like for me at least it might 
be a combination of other things, 
but it’s had a big impact on my men-
tal health and just my hope for the 
future. When you believe that you 
don’t belong here, you don’t believe 
that it is going to give you the poten-
tial to be great.”
Counseling and Psychological 
Services psychologist Dr. Chris-
tine Asidao has recently noticed 
a growing trend among students 
with symptoms of the imposter 
syndrome.
“It’s 
not 
typically 
students 
directly say they have impos-
ter syndrome — it’s typically 
the qualities that I see such 
as feeling inadequate, maybe 
having experiences of just low 
self-confidence, low self-worth, 
there’s a lot of social compari-
son,” Asidao said. “Thinking 
about the motto of the univer-
sity: leaders and best. Does that 
mean everyone can be a leader 
and everyone can be the best?”
Socioeconomic status can 
also heighten the impact of 
imposter 
syndrome. 
Every 
semester since her freshman 
year Hancock has worked a 
part-time job. For three years, 
Hancock operated as an assis-
tant manager at a bar, serving 
drinks from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. 

multiple days a week. During foot-
ball seasons, she said would work 
up to six days a week.
“I actually feel like I don’t think 
I made it work that well,” Han-
cock said. “My grades went down. 
They’ve gotten way better this 
semester, as it’s the first semester I 
haven’t worked since my freshman 
year. For me, that’s cold hard evi-
dence that having to work in order 
to survive is not really beneficial for 
students here.”
Hancock is also a residential 
adviser at Bursley Residence Hall, 
a position she said she took to com-
pensate for the lack of affordable 
housing in Ann Arbor.
In The Daily’s survey, 68.1 per-
cent of respondents from house-
holds with a yearly income of less 
than $100,000 said they found it 
challenging to accept compliments, 
compared to half of respondents 
with a yearly family income of 
$100,000-200,000 and only 35.9 
percent of those whose families 
made more than $200,000 a year.
Paired with a lack of interest 
and insufficient funding for books, 
Hancock said she felt discouraged 
and switched her focus from pre-
med to gender and health.
“I had a hard time thinking of 
being this put-together profes-
sional when I kind of come from a 
‘white trash’ family — and antici-
pating that I don’t know how to 
work a job that’s not like my par-
ents in a factory,” Hancock said. 
“I had to be taught by my partner, 
like, whether you wear a belt with 
dress pants or not. A lot of it is just 
trying to separate where I come 
from and where I’m going. I don’t 
have to remain completely the 
same as where I’m from, I’m here, 
so I should be on the same bar as all 
these other people.”

wq“Kayleah... 
Kayleah… 
KAYLEAH.”
My mother always repeated her 
statements in threes, louder each 
round, without any care if I had 
responded or not. It didn’t matter 
to her whether it was at the dinner 
table, the grocery store, in the quiet 
aisles of the library, or while driving 
on the freeway with me in the 
car… sitting next to her.
And with every repetition, I 
became equally impatient and 
irritated.
“Mom… MOM… WHAT DO 
YOU WANT?”
I admit, I’ve lost my temper 
at times when my mom and I 
simply talk – merely because of her 
severely prolonged explanations 
(repeated several times, of course) 
that would drive me insane.
“Get to the point,” I would tell 
her. “Stop talking so loud,” I would 
yell back. I became frustrated: Was 

it her difficulty in speaking English? 
Was it her personality? Or was it 
because of her home culture?
I searched for all the possible 
rationales to explain her ceaseless 
echo of thoughts.
“Sorry ddal *…” she would 
apologize.
Afterwards 
rolled 
in 
an 
uneasy silence that left both of us 
awkwardly shuffling our hands at 
the dinner table, the grocery store, 
in the quiet aisles of the library, or 
while driving in the car.
“It’s fine, but mom –– explain 
clearer,” I would say. Then I would 
sheepishly smile. But I always felt 
bad.
Ensuing our altercation was 
always this look on her face that I 
couldn’t describe: Sorrow? Guilt? 
Embarrassment? Frustration?
I could never figure out.
For my entire life, I’ve always 
assumed 
her 
gradually 
loud, 
repetitive demeanor was a fusion 
of her immigrant experience and 
lack of knowing English. Her long-
winded commentary and responses 

would prime my ignorance; I would 
berate her with a harsh tone, hoping 
to stifle her monotonous discourse.
However, it’s taken years for me 
to realize that it’s women who come 
from backgrounds where they’re 
not heard –– women of color –– that 
have learned to speak louder to get 
their points across. Consequently, 
her life as a maternal figure, 
housewife and stay-at-home parent 
nurtured and shaped her voice, 
while simultaneously muffling her 
inherent range of expression as 
a human. Within the East Asian 
culture that perpetuates the male 
dominance 
and 
subordinate, 
inferior women, I realized her loud 
and discursive conversations was 
not to overpower others, rather 
for someone to simply listen to her 
thoughts.
So mom –– I’m sorry for getting 
mad at you. I’ll always try my best to 
hear you out.
Whenever you need me,
I’ll always be listening.
Love,
Kayleah

Diminished voices, 
speaking loud

What’s in a name?

When parents and teachers bully kids

Sylvia. 
Silvia. 
Sylvie. 
Sophia. Sofia. Sophie. Saliva. 
Okay, maybe the last one 
isn’t as common as the first 
couple examples, but you get 
the point. All of these names 
have graced my Starbucks 
cups, have been called out 
by GSIs and professors in 
class roll call, and sometimes 
even have slipped out of the 
mouths of both friends and 
family members at one point 
or another. For the last 20 
years of my life, I have lived 
with a name that gives off 
major old lady vibes and 
seems to confuse pretty much 
every person that has the 
unfortunate job of reading it 
out loud (don’t even get me 
started on my last name).
But 
regardless 
of 
these 
(mostly) 
minor 
inconveniences, 
I 
can’t 
imagine being called by any 
other 
name. 
The 
history 

behind my name and its 
quirkiness fits my personality 
to a tee. My parents were 
expecting a boy and had the 
name 
Maximilian 
picked 
out and ready to go. It was a 
surprise when I showed up 
a week after my due date not 
only late, but also a different 
sex than they were expecting. 
They played with the idea 
of keeping “Max,” but felt as 
though it didn’t quite fit their 
new bundle of chubby cheeks 
and mass of black hair. After 
much debate (it was a close call 
between Sylvia and Noelle), 
I was given a first name after 
my 
maternal 
grandmother 
and a middle name that was 
a variation of my paternal 
grandma. The full name on 
my birth certificate is Sylvia 
Marie Gisler.
I 
absolutely 
love 
being 
named after my grandmas. It 
feels as though a piece of them 
is with me always and I am 
constantly reminded of my role 
models and the type of woman 
that I aim to be. One of the best 

parts of having the same first 
name as my maternal grandma 
is the differentiations my 
family uses to keep us apart. 
My grandma is referred to as 
“Big Sylvia” while I am “Little 
Sylvia,” which is hilariously 
ironic due to our height 
difference of almost a foot. I 
am constantly in awe of how 
strong she is as a person and 
the lengths that she’s gone to 
keep our family together.
My mom and her family 
differ in many ways, from 
parenting styles to political 
beliefs, 
and 
there’s 
often 
tension at holidays and dinners. 
But despite these differences, 
she’s always ready to keep 
the conversation moving and 
regroup after a particularly 
heated debate. She has learned 
how to adapt and live in 
America after immigrating 
from the Philippines and was 
able to give her children the 
opportunities and choices that 
weren’t always available to 
her. I am proud to be called by 
her name.

In December 2018, a teenage 
girl named Aritry Adhikary in 
Bangladesh ended her life after 
her parents were insulted by her 
teachers. Aritry went to a Bengali 
medium school, Viqarunnisa, 
and during her exams was found 
with her cell-phone,— in violation 
of the rules in school. Her parents 
were summoned to school the 
next day where they spoke to 
the class teacher who informed 
them Aritry was expelled. Her 
father narrated the incident and 
revealed that they all cried and 
asked for mercy, including his 
daughter helplessly begging for 
forgiveness at the principal’s 
feet. However, the headmaster 
remained unconvinced. Aritry 
left this scene earlier, and was 
found hanging from the ceiling 
later in the day.
Following this tragic incident, 
there has been uproar from 
students and Aritry’s parents 
have 
sued 
the 
school 
for 
instigating her suicide. When I 
heard this excruciating story, I 
had many thoughts on my mind 
and a deepening sadness for a 
life that shouldn’t have been lost. 
But I found myself horrifically 
empathizing with the shame 
she felt. There were many points 
in my life where I couldn’t see 
anything but a bleak future,— a 
suffocating image imprinted on 
my mind by punitive pressures 
exerted from those older than me, 
whether they were my teachers 
or family members.
Even 
though 
I 
went 
to 
a 
different 
school, 
penal 
disciplinary 
methods 
were 
largely normalized in educational 
institutions and in every corner of 
the social structure. As suicides 
and tragic incidents continue 
to happen, it’s not the 66-year 
old institute and their policies 
that should be held accountable. 
There is a larger sociocultural 
problem that undergirds such 
devastating events. We must 
recognize that humiliation and 
fear-mongering narratives have 
become intrinsically embedded 
in schooling and parenting, and 
we have to come to terms with it.
During my formative years, 
some teachers were the most 
caring individuals I’ve ever seen, 
but others were not. I have seen 
more teachers bully students 
than I have seen peers bully each 
other. I still remember a teacher 
slapping the most notorious kid 
when we were in first grade. 
When insulting a student for 
poor grades, references were 
made to family backgrounds. 
Teachers routinely yelled and 

we were expected to silently 
swallow our shame even when 
the most insulting words words 
were fired upon us. They were 
our educators, and in respect to 
their service, we were expected 
to obey without question. We 
were taught to be stoic; in our 
uniforms; we were somehow 
expected to be the same human 
being — robotic, methodical and 
straight A students. The value of 
academic success was taught as a 
matter of life and death, not as a 
concept that serves our lives and 
our personal passion.
This sort of policing was not 
only limited to formal education. 
Many of us had private tutors, 
and 
we 
attended 
“coaching 
centers” for private tuition. When 
I was fifteen, I joined three of 
these tutors’ private classes with 
my peers for chemistry, physics 
and math. The Physics teacher 
had a great track record: “All his 
students get As in the IGCSEs.” 
Prior to joining his class, I asked 
parents of other students what 
was the key to his success? Some 
forty-year old mothers boastingly 
informed me: “He is very strict. 
He hits you with a scale if you 
score less than 80.”
In reality, it was never this 
“hitting” that made me study. I 
stopped going to my math tutor 
after he hit me with a scale. I 
stopped going to Chemistry class 
after the tutor grossly insulted 
my parents for my absences. I 
revolted to my Physics teacher 
for hitting his students, and when 
he listened to what I had to say, 
I stayed in his class. I learned 
nothing from those who belittled 
me. I learned that I never want 
to see their hateful faces again 
— which is a very “normal” 
reaction. I received good grades 
by disciplining myself to study at 
home. I learned when my father 
sat with me to discuss Demand-
Supply 
curves 
with 
current 
events, and when he handed out 
excel sheets with a timetable 
to help me study for my exams. 
Violence and humiliation can 
never enforce discipline. It only 
cooks fear that is never effective 
in the long run.
But the question is why is this 
sort of behavior allowed from 
adults? Why is this considered 
productive? 
And 
why 
do 
parents so readily accept it? It 
is because many parents also 
believe degradation is key to 
train children. Most of us, South 
Asian kids, have been bullied 
by adults, and beaten up by our 
parents. In Kindergarten, my 
teachers complained about my 
handwriting and short attention 
span. They scolded me in class, 
and mother physically abused me 

for it as though I was on trial for 
first degree murder. Most of my 
friends can empathize with such 
treatment from adults. Fifteen 
years later, my handwriting is 
now worse than Kindergarten, 
and it makes no difference to my 
academic performance or my life. 
And I still have a short attention 
span, except I now know it’s 
called ADHD. I also learned I can 
get treated for it and I don’t have 
to kill myself because I couldn’t 
concentrate and got a seventy-
percent in my fourth grade math 
exam.
For the longest time, my family 
members said: “It’s for your own 
good, you’ll learn when you are 
a parent.” I can assure you I 
won’t need to choke my kid to 
make them eat and study. I can 
assure that there is zero logic in 
nurturing my worst impulses. 
About five years ago, mother 
apologized and owned up to 
her mistakes. I don’t resent my 
mother for what she did because 
I always understood it was a 
societal problem and not her 
personal issue. I even consider 
myself lucky for my mother’s 
realizations, because most of my 
friends’ parents still continue to 
believe that abuse was the right 
method. In other words, irrational 
violence 
and 
humiliation 
is 
normalized under the fallacious 
umbrella: 
“Authority 
of 
the 
elderly.” And the most dangerous 
element 
to 
this 
pernicious 
normalization 
of 
violence 
is 
recycling it intergenerationally. 
Many friends of mine believe that 
you need to hit and yell at kids to 
make them listen, which shows 
how ingrained this problem is.
The irony of all this is that 
parents 
and 
teachers 
who 
adopt 
destructive 
techniques 
actually do it out of love and care. 
Intimidation and punishment 
has become standardized as the 
most effective form of training 
to the extent that it has become 
difficult to see the problem with 
it. It is difficult to look beyond 
the system and realize that you 
cannot teach kids to respect 
others by disrespecting them. 
And as I write this, a part of me 
still fears that those older than me 
will read it and I will be labelled 
as the delinquent girl, who went 
to the United States and became 
too foreign. Yet, all I’m trying to 
say is don’t bully kids, just don’t, 
and that shouldn’t be an invalid, 
ungrateful or belligerent tagline 
when kids are out there feeling 
hopeless and ending their lives. 
Adults need to be vigilant, they 
need to lighten up and stop 
nourishing their own anger at the 
cost of a child’s mental health.

L

ike 
countless 
people 
from around the globe, 
I 
watched 
in 
horror 
as a terrible fire ravaged the 
irreplaceable 
Notre 
Dame 
Cathedral in Paris on April 
15. As the damage unfolded, 
I found myself transfixed to 
whatever screen was in front of 
me, watching the same images 
of fire and destruction over and 
over again. At some point during 
the day, I started to question 
why I was mired in grief over 
the devastation of a cathedral I 
seemingly had little connection to 
as a non-Christian American.
It’s this universal sense of 
loss for humanity, however, that 
illuminates the essence of Notre 
Dame. The cathedral is a symbol 
for spirituality and togetherness 
that transcends time, space and 
ideology. While part of what was 
lost in the fire is gone forever, it’s 
important to remember that the 
cathedral is more than the sum of 
its stone and timber. The process 
of rebuilding Notre Dame gives us 
an opportunity to renew not only 
the structure of Notre Dame, but 
the values it stands for as well.
The Notre Dame Cathedral is 
one of the earliest and grandest 
examples of Medieval Gothic 
architecture, built over a century 
on the Seine River island of Île de 
la Cité. Notre Dame has stood out 
among other Gothic cathedrals, 
utilizing a revolutionary flying 
buttress support system to soar 
to 35 meters high, taller than any 
Catholic church before it. The 
cathedral’s Gothic architecture 
has awed those in its presence 
for the past 850 years, bringing 
worshippers closer to the heavens 
above and minimizing their size in 
the presence of God. Abbot Suger, 
one of the earliest proponents of 
Gothic architecture, described 
the effects of the jeweled altar 
as such: “When … the loveliness 
of the many-coloured gems has 
called me away from external 
cares … and that, by the grace of 
God, I can be transported from 
this inferior to that higher world 
in an anagogical manner.”
Adding 
to 
Notre 
Dame’s 
distinction 
as 
a 
cultural 
monument, the cathedral has 
played host to a great deal of 
Europe’s storied history. Among 
many historic events at Notre 
Dame, Henry VI of England 
was crowned king there in 1431, 

Napoleon 
crowned 
himself 
emperor there in 1804 and Pope 
Pius X beatified Joan of Arc 
there in 1909. It’s these historical 
events that have solidified Notre 
Dame’s role in our culture as a 
place where any person, even 
the most powerful, stands small 
before God, acknowledging the 
inferiority of our world compared 
with the heavens above.
As part of Notre Dame’s 
intriguing history, the cathedral 
has been subjected to vandalism 
and neglect. During the French 
Revolution, the cathedral was 
targeted by vandals and renamed 
the “Temple to the Goddess 
Reason” 
by 
a 
revolutionary 
state hostile to the Catholic 
Church and religion in general. 
Additonally, worshippers at Notre 
Dame paid tribute to a woman 
posing as the goddess of reason, 
mocking the Catholic faith. The 
targeting of Notre Dame by anti-
Catholic zealots only solidified 
the cathedral’s lasting role as a 
universal symbol for God’s grace 
on earth.
Even 
though 
Napoleon 
returned Notre Dame back to 
the Catholic Church following 
the revolutionary period, the 
building was in a state of disrepair 
by the early to mid-19th century. 
French poet and novelist Victor 
Hugo brought the cathedral’s 
dilapidated 
condition 
to 
the 
public’s attention with his popular 
historical novel “The Hunchback 
of Notre Dame” in 1831. With 
that book, the enduring legend 
of Quasimodo, the hunchback 
of Notre Dame, was born along 
with renewed public interest 
in maintaining the cathedral. 
The renewed interest led to a 
major restoration project in the 
mid-19th century by the French 
architect 
Eugène-Emmanuel 
Viollet-le-Duc. It was during this 
restoration that Notre Dame’s 
now iconic spire was added on to 
the structure. This substantial 
alteration illustrates part of Notre 
Dame’s physical transformation 
through the centuries, never 
losing its core meaning along the 
way.
With Notre Dame restored 
to glory in the mid-19th century, 
the cathedral was again ready to 
set the scene for history during 
the liberation of Paris in 1944. 
The area directly in front of 
Notre Dame saw heavy fighting 

during a major uprising of French 
resistance 
fighters 
against 
occupying Nazi soldiers. When 
Allied forces finally liberated 
Paris, crowds rejoiced in front of 
Notre Dame as the cathedral bells 
rang, signifying a free France. 
With the liberation of Paris, Notre 
Dame again claimed a central 
role in European history. It’s this 
history as a place where humanity 
meets the heavens that makes 
Notre Dame an icon, irrespective 
of 
physical 
changes 
to 
the 
structure over the years.
Notre 
Dame’s 
legendary 
status as a backdrop to history 
and monument to the heavens 
makes this week’s devastating 
fire difficult to process. While 
it appears that much of Notre 
Dame’s religious relics and art 
survived the fire, the losses are 
still immense. The cathedral lost 
most of its roof made of original 
13th century timber, known as 
“the forest” for the sheer number 
of trees cut down for the wooden 
latticework. The soaring Notre 
Dame spire, an iconic element of 
Paris’ skyline, also succumbed to 
the flames.
Despite 
the 
devastating 
damage, 
French 
President 
Emmanuel Macron has pledged to 
rebuild the Notre Dame cathedral 
to its former glory in 5 years. 
While Notre Dame will never be 
quite the same, its next chapter 
has the potential to live up to its 
illustrious history. With societal 
changes such as globalization 
and migration roiling the fabric 
of Western culture, the ideals of 
Notre Dame are more important 
than ever. More than a simple 
structure, Notre Dame is a 
symbol for what human beings 
can accomplish when we put 
our differences aside and work 
together for a higher purpose. 
The soaring proportions of Notre 
Dame remind us all that, no matter 
our worldly stature, we pale in 
comparison to a higher power. 
These universal ideals cannot 
be destroyed by fire. Instead, we 
have an opportunity to live up to 
the meaning of Notre Dame by 
putting aside our differences and 
working together as one to rebuild 
it. In doing so, we will only add to 
the legacy of Notre Dame as the 
cathedral rises out of the ashes.

ABBIE BERRINGER | COLUMN

What if I become a stay-at-home mom?
I 

have always been raised on a 
path toward a successful, full-
time career. My parents and 
I have talked about it since I was 
young. I am the oldest daughter with 
only one other sibling who was very 
ill for much of her childhood, so as a 
kid I spent a lot of time as my parents’ 
sole helper. Living on a farm, there 
was never a shortage of work to be 
done, and I was expected to pull my 
weight and do a good job. “We have 
to go fix the fence” is still a phrase 
that haunts an occasional nightmare. 
My parents taught me that I could 
do any work I put my mind to and 
always wanted me to be successful. 
As I began to excel in school they 
challenged me to pursue my dreams 
and always pushed me to go to college 
and to have a career someday.
Yet as I went into my sophomore 
year of college, the decision to pursue 
a full-time career began to weigh 
on me. I had spent the past year 
working with first-grade students 
at an elementary school in Ypsilanti 
through the America Reads program 
and felt an immense amount of 
satisfaction from the relationships I 
created with them. This experience 
helped me to realize how much I 
truly yearn for a family someday, 
and thus I began to face the gnawing 
question of what type of mother I 
wanted to be.
All of a sudden I began to ask 
myself: Would I feel more fulfilled 
staying at home with my kids, if 
financially possible? Would I feel 
more fulfilled being there with them 
through every milestone in their 
youth, being the one to teach them 
to walk, talk, read and write? While 
I know so many wonderful working 
mothers, and know many children 
raised by two working parents who 
admire them immensely and are 
proud of all the skills they gained 
from that lifestyle, I began to wonder 
if trying to work full-time and raise a 
family would be right for me or would 
create the kind of family dynamic 
that I want to have as an adult.
My 
mother 
stayed 
home 
with my sister and I most of our 
childhood, but as we entered high 
school she re-entered the workforce. 
This dynamic completely changed 
how our family functioned. Even 
with all of us picking up more of 
the workload at home with chores, 
cooking and cleaning, things weren’t 
the same. Now both of our parents 
came home tired, more irritable and 
distracted after long days of work, 

missed some of our extracurricular 
events and couldn’t always answer 
our phone calls or be around on 
weekends. The feelings associated 
with this change were no doubt 
accentuated by a lifetime of taking all 
that my mother did for us at home for 
granted. Yet as I looked back, I began 
to reflect on how fundamental she 
was throughout all of the seemingly 
mundane day-to-day parts of my 
childhood.
During my infancy, she read 
and talked to me constantly as she 
went about her day. As I grew older 
she was able to make me healthy 
homemade lunches, drop me off 
at school and pick me up if I got 
injured or sick. She sat with me 
through hours of homework, took 
my sister and I on fun adventures 
in the summertime and we read 
books all the time. Because of her 
influence, I began watching the 
news and became invested in politics 
long before I finished elementary 
school. I’ve always known that she 
fueled my passion for history and 
politics through her own, but I never 
stopped to consider how different 
my childhood could have been if she 
had been working 40-hour weeks 
just like my dad all that time. While 
many modern childcare providers 
provide excellent education and care 
for young children, if one can afford 
it (and that is a big if), I feel that these 
benefits couldn’t have replaced the 
strong relationship I developed with 
my mother or the family values she 
cultivated in me everyday.
Studies have found that children 
“who spend long hours in child care 
may experience more stress and 
are at increased risk of becoming 
overly aggressive and developing 
other behavior problems.” While 
competing studies have shown that 
there may be benefits for children 
of 
working 
parents, 
especially 
daughters of working mothers, due to 
increased independence and having 
a working mother as a positive role 
model, others have continued to 
question the importance of the role 
of a stay-at-home parent. The better 
economic situation of having two 
incomes can often benefit a child’s 
education, while the lack of parental 
attention can lead to feelings of 
neglect and troubled inter-family 
relationships later on in a child’s life.
All of this conflicting literature, 
however, hasn’t changed how I feel 
about potentially staying home with 
my kids. My only fear is that if I make 

the choice to stay home, I will lose the 
respect of many of the career women 
around me. Even on campus I have 
heard many young women make 
negative comments about stay-at-
home mothers that concern me when 
I consider that these peers will be the 
women that surround me as an adult 
as well.
My mother faced the scrutiny 
and judgment of career women in our 
communities who treated her as if 
her life was easy and raising kids full-
time wasn’t a respectable choice. She 
was scolded by women around her 
as if she were a failure to feminism, 
a sentiment that many women who 
choose to stay at home claim to share. 
These particular women seemed 
to hold the opinion that because 
women had access to work they 
had a responsibility to permanently 
shed homemaking and stay-at-home 
motherhood all together. So much 
of third and fourth-wave feminist 
theory claims to be embracing the 
liberal mantras of intersectionality, 
diversity and inclusion, and yet they 
exclude the increasing number of 
women who make the choice to stay 
home.
My hope is that by the time I am 
in a position to make that choice, if 
it becomes financially available to 
me, I will have the appreciation and 
respect of not only my spouse and 
parents, but of the women around 
me too. I don’t want to feel as if I have 
failed anybody’s expectations and it 
is sad to think that making the choice 
to stay home and raise kids is seen as 
a failure in our modern world. While 
I am immensely grateful to live in a 
time where I have the opportunity 
to choose to enter the workforce 
full time in nearly any career field I 
would like, it doesn’t mean that I have 
to make this choice simply to buck 
traditional values. In fact, I hope that 
modern America can learn to respect 
families and women who still choose 
traditional values and stay-at-home 
motherhood instead of shaming 
them the way my mother and other 
stay-at-home mothers I know have 
been shamed. While the choice may 
not be for everyone, I know one thing 
for certain: I have nothing but respect 
and admiration for the work my 
mother did in raising my sister and 
me, and she deserves that respect not 
just from me but from other women 
as well.

E

veryone’s a disrupter 
these 
days. 
Whether 
it’s trying to disrupt 
capitalism or trying 
to disrupt how the 
residents 
of 
San 
Francisco consume 
their 
overpriced 
juice, no one seems 
to be happy with 
the way things are. 
However, I believe 
we’ve run into a 
problem 
of 
sorts 
that there is not 
much disrupting left 
to do.
Netflix is a prime example 
of disruptive technology. As 
Netflix has gotten older, it 
has become a worse platform 
because everyone has tried 
to disrupt the industry by 
introducing more and more 
streaming services – Hulu, 
Amazon Prime Video, HBO 
Go 
and 
Disney’s 
recently 
announced 
Disney+. 
And 
though Netflix was the original 
steaming service, since other 
copycat services were created, 
certain broadcast companies 
have 
started 
pulling 
their 
content 
from 
Netflix. 
I 
remember when you could 
watch “Family Guy,” “How I 
Met Your Mother” and others 
on Netflix, but today those 
have all gone elsewhere – and 
there is no sign this will stop. 
Perhaps we are headed toward 
a reality wherein CBS, NBC 
and every other studio will 
stray from signing contracts 
and instead launch their own 
streaming service and if you 
just want a few shows from 
each provider, you have to 
buy all of those subscriptions. 
Of course, once this happens, 
rates of pirating content will 
probably rise. This entire mess 
is ironic because this problem 
is exactly what was supposed 
to be fixed with Netflix. 
Recall that one of the original 

motives behind the whole “cut 
the cord” movement was that 
instead of watching all shows 
offered on cable you 
had to subscribe to 
them all – something 
addressed 
by 
Netflix.
Uber 
is 
another 
example 
of 
disruptive 
technology, but in 
a 
different 
way. 
Uber worked well 
because it addressed 
a 
monopoly. 
The 
reason 
Uber 
was 
able 
to 
grow as fast as it did (despite 
leadership being caught with 
their pants down about once a 
month) was because of the way 
most taxi medallion markets 
were set up. Let’s take New 
York City as an example. In 
a nutshell, the cycle went 
something like this: someone 
would want to be a taxi driver 
and hence needed a medallion. 
Very few new medallions were 
released by the government 
each year due to lobbying 
by the taxi industry, so the 
only way to start was to buy 
a retiring cabbie’s medallion, 
usually for enormous sums. 
That 
cabbie 
would 
then 
retire on that money, so the 
person who wanted to be a 
cabbie would then work until 
retirement and this process 
would happen again. Uber 
came along and removed the 
need for that medallion. They 
democratized the profession of 
taxi driver almost overnight. 
What 
has 
happened 
as 
a 
result? Like most things, there 
have been ups and downs — 
discrimination 
tended 
to 
both decrease and increase 
with 
these 
ride 
sharing 
services, and there have been 
complaints 
about 
Uber’s 
business practices.
Uber worked well because it 
addressed a niche market that 

was in need of being disrupted 
— Netflix did the same when 
it joined the market as a 
streaming service. However, as 
Uber has started doing things 
like Uber Pool Express, a bit 
of a problem has come up. The 
idea behind Express is pretty 
simple: A group of people set 
their destinations and then 
all meet at a predetermined 
spot. Then they are driven to 
another predetermined spot 
and walk the rest of the way 
to their destination. If this 
sounds familiar, then you may 
have heard of a revolutionary 
technology known as a bus, 
which dates to 1905. The issue 
with buses, however, is not 
that they need to be disrupted 
– it is that they need to be 
better funded, among other 
things.
Uber Pool Express’s problem 
is that it’s trying to reinvent 
the wheel and that really gets 
at the banality of so much of 
“disruption” and “innovation”: 
it is done for seemingly no 
reason (save ego stroking). 
However, it makes sense that 
this problem has come up — 
and it is not just with Netflix 
and Uber. I would argue we as 
a society have run out of things 
to change, and we ought to 
stop pretending otherwise and 
creating things for the sake of 
it. This is how we ended up in 
the near parody that we live 
in today featuring everything 
from Netflix for coffee to Uber 
for private jets. Disruption 
just for the sake of disrupting 
(you don’t need a Netflix for 
everything, same with Uber) 
is tiresome. Truth be told, a lot 
of things are fine the way they 
are, and it would do us well to 
reflect on that before trying to 
reinvent the wheel – or bus.

If 
you’re 
familiar 
with 
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan at all, 
you’ve probably heard him sing 
alongside Pearl Jam’s Eddie 
Vedder in a rendition of Neil 
Young’s “The Long Road” in 
the 1995 Tim Robbins film of 
the same name. Or, like me, 
you grew up with parents who 
practically 
worshipped 
the 
man. Either way, you’re familiar 
with a voice that is stunningly 
beautiful and haunting, one 
of those voices that makes you 
believe in the existence of a 
special muse inhabiting a lucky 
few because surely such a gift 
cannot be human.
Born in Faisalbad, Pakistan, 
Khan came from a musically-
inclined family. Several of his 
family members were skilled 
in the art of Qawwali music, a 
form of devotional music linked 
to Sufi Islam, a mystical sect of 
Islam. The genre was invented 
in 12th-century Persia and can 
be compared with Gospel music 
in the sense that it combines 
devotional 
and 
religious 
themes with a complex musical 
tradition as well. Qawwali songs 
are typically sung in groups of 
eight to nine men accompanied 
by instruments such as the 
harmonium (comparable to a 
portable pipe organ) and tabla 
(a type of drum). Often long and 
sprawling in length and scope, a 
Qawwali song aims to induce a 
trance-like state in its listeners. 
 
Following a strict structure 
dedicated 
to 
various 
topics 
of 
both 
religious 
and 
secular 
concepts, 
Qawwali 
compositions 
nonetheless 
feature 
several 
moments 

of 
vocal 
and 
instrumental 
improvisation around a central 
theme. They are sung in South 
Asian languages such as Urdu, 
Hindi, Punjabi or Bengali. As 
noted before, they can be both 
secular and religious in nature, 
with the implicit assumption 
that even the secular can be 
interpreted in the context of 
religion and the common themes 
of love and devotion. Qawwali 
is deeply related to a similar 

but separate genre of poetry 
and music known as Ghazal, 
which usually juxtaposes the 
pain and beauty of love in a 
form 
somewhat 
reminiscent 
of a sonnet. Khan’s nephew, 
Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, as well as 
the Indian singer Jagjit Singh, 
were 
also 
instrumental 
in 
introducing and briding these 
traditional forms of music to a 
modern audience, influencing 
the music heard in movies in 
India and Pakistan.
Ali Khan was a sight to behold 
in more ways than one. Zareena 
Grewal, a professor of religion 
at Yale, mentions in an NPR 
piece that he was “morbidly 
obese, (had) crazy hair, (and 
had) 
these 
intense 
facial 
expressions as he’s singing,” 
as one can see in any of his 

performances. The man seemed 
to extract every possible ounce 
of power and emotion out of his 
body during his performances: 
He was blessed with an unreal 
vocal range. Despite his wild 
gesticulations, 
he 
had 
an 
impressive control over his 
voice down to the tightest 
vibrato. It carried an inherent 
throatiness 
and 
roughness 
which he somehow utilized 
perfectly even with the most 
delicate of lyrics.
Khan was not the most 
likely of international South 
Asian 
superstars, 
yet 
he 
cultivated 
an 
extremely 
successful 
international 
career. 
He 
performed 
in 
concert 
venues 
across 
the 
world and collaborated with 
artists from Peter Gabriel to 
the 
aforementioned 
Vedder. 
He received a host of awards, 
from a UNESCO Music Prize 
to his own country’s Pride of 
Performance award. While he 
was never entirely comfortable 
with the fact that most of his 
modern audience could not 
understand his lyrics, he also 
felt that “whatever spiritual 
component that was in the 
lyrics, it was also in the way he 
sang it,” according to guitarist 
Michael Brooks.
Unfortunately, his career was 
cut short at the early age of 48 
in 1997. Ever since, his influence 
on both Qawwali as well as 
South Asian music in general 
has spread all over the world, 
bringing the characteristics of a 
relatively niche, spiritual form 
of music to an international 
audience. 
While 
not 
“easy 
listening” by any means, it is 
not difficult to listen to that 
legendary voice and appreciate 
the talent behind it.

DAILY WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

SAYAN GHOSH
Daily World Music Columnist

Ali Khan was a 
sight to behold in 
more ways than 
one.

Going home to an empty 
house after seeing “High Life,” 
I saw the sharp dichotomy of 
absence and presence in a new 
light. I was acutely aware of the 
sensations of being alive and 
being alone. As the absences in 
“High Life” call attention to the 
meaningfulness of presence, 
the empty sofas and chairs in 
my living room are heavy with 
the weight of empty space.
“High Life” calls to mind 
“2001: A Space Odyssey” and 
perhaps 
a 
dystopian 
“Star 
Trek.” 
Rich 
with 
brilliant 
colors 
and 
mind-bending 
interstellar graphics, the film 
immerses the viewer in space. 
Pun unintended, “High Life” 
revolves around a black hole — 
an absent center representing 
absence itself. The film follows 
Ship 7, its crew comprised 
of 
society’s 
rejects: 
Death-
row inmates sent to be the 
conductors and subjects of 
experiments beyond the solar 
system. Ship 7 has a dual mission, 
at once seeking a way to harvest 
energy from a black hole while 
simultaneously 
investigating 
human reproduction in deep 
space. It is the latter which has 
greater consequence and which 
drives the film’s temporally 
convoluted 
plot. 
Jumping 
between past, long past and 
present, we see humanity from 
every angle.
Robert 
Pattinson 
(“Twilight”) 
gives 
a 
monumental 
and 
career-
defining performance as Monte, 
our main protagonist. Monte 
is unique among the crew 
for his thoughtful interiority 
and 
genetic 
strength. 
The 
gentleness at his core is most 
evident 
in 
his 
relationship 
with 
his 
daughter, 
Willow 
(Jessie Ross, “The Frankenstein 
Chronicles”). Monte remains 
grounded by tending to the 
ship’s fertile garden. A garden 

to remind the crew of Earth 
and the viewer of the potency 
of life and death. Not unlike the 
womb, the garden is a place of 
cultivation; Monte is the lone 
cultivator among chaos and sick 
minds. For the early part of the 
mission, Monte and the rest of 
the crew are at the mercy of Dr. 
Dibs (Juliette Binoché, “The 
English Patient”). It is the doctor 
who controls the investigation 
of reproduction, much to the 
dismay of her subjects. Seeking 
life in the most inhospitable 
of environments, Dr. Dibs is 
a twisted personification of 
female sexuality. Mia Goth 

(“A 
Cure 
for 
Wellness”) 
compliments 
Binoché’s 
performance, 
offering 
a 
juxtaposed 
relationship 
between a woman and her body. 
The cast plays well off of one 
another; tension and passion 
saturate each scene and bleed 
into the theater.
Director Claire Denis (“Beau 
travail”) probes the human 
experience of solitude through 
Monte’s powerful will to live. 
Toward the end of the film, 
Monte asks Willow, “Cruelty? 
What do you know about 
cruelty?” 
Having 
spent 
an 
eternity sailing through space, 
Monte poses the question to 
the viewer as well. What is left 
of our human nature when the 
human is so far removed from 
home? Travelling at lightspeed, 
time passes more slowly for 
the crew than for those on 
Earth. If I follow the film’s 

math correctly, the roughly 17 
years Monte spends on Ship 7 is 
equivalent to over 200 years on 
Earth. Monte and Willow share 
an unfathomable experience 
of love bounded by solitude, 
stretched to eternity’s end. The 
relationship between father and 
daughter stands in refreshing 
contrast 
to 
the 
lustful, 
mechanical presentation of sex 
and reproduction throughout 
the film. Filial love does more 
to sustain Monte than the 
ship’s life-support systems — a 
poignant statement about love 
as a fundamental requisite for 
survival.
Without spoiling anything, 
I would be remiss not to 
mention the film’s finale. The 
final scene emerges from a 
collaboration between Denis 
and artist Olafur Eliasson and 
incorporates Eliasson’s 2014 
art installation “Contact.” A 
site-specific work exhibited at 
the Fondation Louis Vuitton 
in Paris, “Contact” evokes the 
horizon, and is used in “High 
Life” as a representation of the 
event horizon, a black hole’s 
theoretical point of no return.
The film comes together 
beautiful in its final moments. 
The incorporation of Eliasson’s 
work echoes the thematic use 
of evocative color throughout 
the film, while the diverse 
soundtrack 
composed 
by 
Stuart A. Staples fits each scene 
perfectly. I really dig the intro 
track, “The Garden,” which 
reminded me of Schoenberg’s 
12-tone work. As the credits 
roll, Pattison’s voice fills the 
theatre on the original track 
“Willow”; 
a 
mellowed-out 
Donovan meets The National 
with a Max Richter chill.
Stanley 
Kubrick 
would 
be proud of Denis’s artistry 
behind 
the 
camera. 
“High 
Life” rightfully joins the ranks 
of science fiction classics like 
“2001,” thrilling at every turn 
and questioning the very nature 
of humanity in the face of 
eternity.

‘High Life’ brings us to 
the brink in a spectacle

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Food is womanly power. 
Women 
should 
not 
be 
sentenced 
to 
the 
kitchen, 
but in my family the men are 
barely allowed in our sacred 
enclave. We are always yelling 
at each other, criticizing the 
young and laughing loudly. 
Every woman in my family 
instinctively knows how to 
cook. We all know how to roll 
grape leaves, work with filo 
and make lamb less gamey. 
There’s a pride in creating joy 
within sustenance.
My mother’s maiden name 
is Maniatakis. Greek culture 
has been the most dominant 
in my life. My grandfather’s 
family emigrated from Crete, 
and with them they brought 
a 
massive 
appreciation 
of 
Greek food. All my aunts and 
female cousins sit together like 
witches, whipping up spells 
filled with feta cheese and 
loads of garlic.
When I was in second grade, 
I went over to a friend’s house 
for dinner and we ate Lean 
Cuisine. I asked them, “What 
happened?” I was genuinely 
worried. My friend responded, 

“This is what we eat all the 
time.” Their parents didn’t 
cook. Growing up, my mother 
always made dinner. Even if it 
wasn’t a feast, we always had 
a full, homemade meal. The 
same is true for my extended 
family. Even if the women in 
my family had full-time jobs, 
they always concocted home-
cooked dinners.
I never thought of this as a 
sign of weakness of the women 
in my family. Regardless of 
gender, 
our 
lives 
revolved 
around the kitchen. It has to 
do with the power that comes 
with 
feeding 
each 
other. 
Women keep the family strong, 
both physically and mentally. 
When we have a big family 
dinner, you eat everything on 
your plate — you eat until you 
literally cannot eat anymore. 
It’s rude not to gorge yourself.
My father — who wasn’t 
initially 
accepted 
into 
the 
family with open arms because 
he’s not Greek — once took 
all his coworkers to my great 
grandmother’s house for a 
meal. After this gesture of 
respect, he became a golden 
icon in the family. Food is love. 
It takes time to make, and it 
gives us a reason to be together.

Now, my friends ask me if I 
would teach them what I know. 
“Can you teach me to make 
baklava?” I don’t know how to 
respond.
The 
memories 
of 
sunny 
afternoons with the women I 
look up to are getting farther 
away. I don’t remember those 
recipes anymore. Food is the 
last aspect of a culture to 
assimilate. To think I am the 
end of the line is horrifying. 
Although 
their 
baklava 
is 
delicious, 
I 
couldn’t 
just 
refer my friend to the nearest 
Ahmo’s Gyros and Deli.
I requested the recipe for 
baklava in our Facebook group. 
Yes, my big fat Greek family 
is so large and sprawling, my 
cousin created a Facebook 
group for us. I received over a 
dozen detailed responses along 
with little suggestions that go 
along with making the best 
batch.
Perhaps 
the 
greatest 
privilege I’ve been given is 
to be raised by impossibly 
strong, supportive women. I 
want to share the joy they’ve 
bestowed upon me with those 
I love. I want to inject pride 
and passion into everything I 
create. Food is where it starts.

Goddesses eat baklava

NATALIE KASTNER
For the Daily

Perched onstage at The Ark 
this past Sunday, Darlingside 
member 
Harris 
Paseltiner 
mused on the band’s journey 
across borders (domestic and 
international) to arrive at the 
rain-soaked streets of Ann 
Arbor. The weather, however 
dreary, did nothing to dampen 
the 
warmth 
and 
vibrant 
energy shared by musicians 
and patrons alike. Paseltiner 
related 
their 
long-awaited 
arrival to a homecoming; their 
performance felt every bit as 
comforting, 
exuberant 
and 
intimate 
as 
a 
homecoming 
should. Darlingside is at their 
best when performing live 
— everyone else should take 
notes.
To start, The Ark’s intimate 
concert space was a perfect 
compliment to the multilayered 
harmonies and soulful lyrics 
of 
the 
band. 
The 
band’s 
signature folk-gospel hybrid 
— rootsy banjo combined with 
the chorus style singing of 
hymns — came to life Sunday 
night. Their music, which can 

sometimes feel heavy, thick 
and buried, was instead crystal 
clear and feather-light. In an 
age where streaming reigns 
supreme, 
Darlingside 
is 
at 
their best when performing 
live. Of course, that’s not 
to say that their recorded 
albums are bad — rather, 
Darlingside capitalizes on the 
unique 
performer-audience 
dynamic that exists only in the 
electric enchantment of live 
performance.
The 
band’s 
energy 
and 
personality shined brilliantly 
as 
they 
offered 
one-sided 
banter to the audience. From 
Auyon 
Mukharji’s 
friendly 
and 
somewhat 
surreal 
introductions, which included 
priceless tidbits like the band’s 
flirtation with red bananas (the 
fruit) or Paseltiner’s admirable 
(but futile) struggle to give up a 
caffeine addiction, Darlingside 
felt more like a group of old 
friends than a larger than 
life band gracing the humble 
streets of Ann Arbor.
Spectacle is a big and beloved 
aspect of performance — from 
show-stopping dance numbers 
to infamous red carpet outfits. 
But it’s the air of simplicity 
Darlingside offers that can be 

so endearing. There’s a touch 
of humility in their demeanors, 
and a sense of vulnerability in 
their singing. They’re just a 
group of friends making good 
music, having good times and 
enjoying as much of life as they 
can.
There’s so much that makes 
Darlingside good — charm, 
talent, a cool name — what 
more could a group need? 
Ah, yes, they also play banjo 
and cello, even the mandolin 
(which, let’s be honest, is 
pretty awesome). They also 
somehow make the lyrics “I 
liked it and I’d do it again / To 
be a turtle and a mayonnaise 
magnet” oddly beautiful. But 
throw away the fancy music 
terms 
and 
unnecessarily 
lengthy descriptions, and at 
their core, Darlingside is just 
fun. And everyone could use 
a little more fun in their lives, 
whether they’re a stressed 
student or the happiest person 
on the planet. So, do yourself 
a big favor, and go listen to 
Darlingside. Pro-tip: Start with 
“In the Morning,” because 
everyone should aspire to be 
a “mayonnaise magnet,” then 
buy tickets to their next live 
show — you can thank me later.

Let the good times roll at 
the Ark with Darlingside

In the run-up to “Avengers: 
Endgame,” I’m running down 
every movie and TV show the 
MCU has ever put out and 
ranking them based on how well 
they tell their stories with the 
means available to them. This 
is the final part of a four part 
series.
11. 
“Marvel’s 
Daredevil”: 
Season One (2015)
The 
first 
season 
of 
“Daredevil” signaled another 
turning point for the MCU, 
proving 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
their Netflix series wasn’t 
only viable, it was different 
from 
anything 
the 
studio 
had 
done 
before. 
Instead 
of its zippier counterparts, 
“Daredevil” 
showed 
that 
Marvel wasn’t afraid to get 
dark with an emphasis on 
heavier 
themes 
and 
more 
complex 
characterization, 
brought to life by Charlie Cox’s 
portrayal of the title character 
and 
Vincent 
D’Onofrio’s 
immediately-iconic take on the 
Kingpin.
10. “Guardians of the Galaxy 
Vol. 2” (2017)
Everything “Guardians of 
the Galaxy Vol. 2” does well 
is exemplified in a single 
perfect scene. As Jay and the 
Americans belt out “Come a 
Little Bit Closer,” we watch 
Yondu take his revenge on his 
mutinous crew and massacre 
his way back to control of his 
ship with Rocket and Groot in 
tow. This is the most delightful 
killing 
spree 
ever 
put 
to 
film. True to the spirit of the 
“Guardians” films, it’s fun, 
hilarious, 
inventively 
shot, 
marvelously scored and really 
twisted when you stop to think 
about it. Over the course of 
about three minutes, hundreds 
of people are killed. And our 
heroes laugh.
9. “Marvel’s The Avengers” 
(2012)
The first time the MCU 
came together and showed 
what it was capable of still 
ranks as one of its finest hours. 
The action soars more so 
than almost any other Marvel 
property with no shortage 
of all-time great moments of 
spectacle — the shot tracking 
the 
Avengers 
through 
the 
streets of New York is as 
astounding today as it was 
the first time we saw it — but 
as always, the most important 
work “The Avengers” does is 
on the Avengers themselves. 
The 
character 
dynamics 
established here are what have 
carried us to the precipice of 
“Endgame.”
8. “Avengers: Infinity War” 
(2018)
“Infinity War” is a film so 
gargantuan in scale that it 
seems 
impossible 
anything 
could ever top it. From the 
first scene to the last, the 
pedal is pushed firmly to the 
floor. There’s little time to 
breathe, yet the Russo brothers 
somehow managed to craft an 
emotional story that put our 
heroes through the ringer, 
gave us a showstopper of a 
villain in Josh Brolin’s Thanos 

and ended on a note of pure 
terror that has kept us all 
waiting with bated breath for 
a year now.
7. “Guardians of the Galaxy” 
(2014)
If you’re looking for the 
moment where Marvel started 
to rule the world, I give you 
“Guardians of the Galaxy.” 
Sure, “The Avengers” had to 
bring together characters from 
separate standalone films, but 
“Guardians” had to introduce 
us to its ensemble cast of 
D-List intergalactic a-holes, 
bring them together and make 
us care about them all in one 
movie while working with a 
cast whose most recognizable 
stars played a talking raccoon 
and tree. “Guardians of the 
Galaxy” is a miracle, and the 
fact that James Gunn and 
Marvel pulled it off in such 
fun, emotional and thrilling 
fashion is what earned the 
MCU the loyal fanbase it has 
today.
6. “Marvel’s Jessica Jones”: 
Season One (2015)
The first season of “Jessica 
Jones” is a bruising story of 
trauma and recovery, a fiery 

rebuke of toxic masculinity 
and a stylish “feminist noir” 
all rolled into one. Led by 
Krystin Ritter’s commanding 
performance, there are few 
beats 
the 
series 
doesn’t 
absolutely 
nail, 
from 
the 
treatment of its title character’s 
PTSD to the characterization 
of its villain, David Tennant’s 
Kilgrave. The shared history 
that reveals itself between 
these two lends itself to the 
most unsettling material in the 
entire MCU, made all the more 
horrifying for its real world 
parallels.
5. “Iron Man” (2008)
Hey, 
remember 
that 
time a multi-billion dollar 
superhero franchise got its 
start with a critique of the 
military-industrial 
complex 
starring an actor coming off 
a string of career setbacks 
and directed by the guy who 
made “Elf”? I’ve mentioned 
a lot of miracles the MCU 
pulled off, so it’s fitting that 
the movie where it all began 
was itself totally miraculous. 
On top of everything else, the 
cast and crew were working 
from an unfinished script and 
reportedly improvised most 
of the dialogue. Somehow it 
all came together, though, and 
provided the foundation for 

the biggest film franchise of 
all time.
4. 
“Marvel’s 
Daredevil”: 
Season Three (2018)
“Daredevil” ended its run 
with one of the finest takes 
on faith and identity the small 
screen has seen in years. Based 
on the iconic “Born Again” arc, 
the season essentially plays 
out as an arresting 13-episode 
game of chess between Matt 
Murdock 
and 
a 
seemingly 
omniscient 
Kingpin. 
D’Onofrio 
has 
never 
been 
better in the role than he is as 
he plots and enacts his revenge 
against Daredevil, while Cox 
plays Matt’s struggle with 
his own duality with brilliant 
precision, a man whose every 
belief has been shattered and 
who has no idea how to pick up 
the pieces.
3. “Captain America: The 
Winter Soldier” (2014)
If you thought you wouldn’t 
leave a “Captain America” 
film uneasy about America’s 
surveillance state, you’d be 
wrong. On top of its surprising 
depth, “The Winter Soldier” 
packs some of the best action 
Marvel has brought to bear, 
ranging from Falcon’s high-
flying stunts to the grounded 
hand-to-hand combat of the 
fights between Steve Rodgers 
and the titular villain. Package 
the whole thing as an espionage 
thriller, and you’ve got one of 
the most electric superhero 
films in recent memory.
2. “Captain America: Civil 
War” (2016)
If the MCU is its characters, 
then it’s “Civil War,” not 
“Infinity War,” that functions 
as the true culmination of 
everything that came before it. 
Just about everyone from every 
corner of the world Marvel 
created is here and they all 
bring their own motivations 
to the fight. While the airport 
sequence 
is 
undoubtedly 
breathtaking, it’s in the final 
battle 
between 
Tony 
and 
Steve that everything comes 
together (while the Avengers 
fall apart). It’s not just about 
the spectacle, it’s about the 
futility of revenge and the ways 
we lash out when the person 
we blame most is ourselves.
1. “Black Panther” (2018)
Ryan Coogler’s exhilarating 
introduction 
to 
Wakanda 
was only released last year, 
but there’s nothing else that 
could have claimed the MCU’s 
throne. 
The 
Afrofuturist 
fantasy world Coogler creates 
feels wholly original even as 
he draws from a diverse set of 
influences in both his sharp 
storytelling and immaculate 
visual design. That’s without 
even touching on the cast, 
filled with so many great 
performances and characters 
that picking a single favorite 
becomes simply impossible. 
It isn’t perfect, but then, 
no Marvel movie has been. 
Instead, like its franchise and 
the heroes it has brought to 
life, it rises to the top because it 
serves as a reminder that all of 
us — from kings down to high-
school students — are capable 
of rising above ourselves and 
becoming something more.
And with that, we’re in the 
endgame.

COLUMBIA RECORDS 

FILM NOTEBOOK

I’m running down 
every movie and 
TV show the 
MCU has ever put 
out and ranking 
them based on 
how well they tell 
their stories 

The most valuable advice 
I can give to any ardent 
fan of a particular piece of 
media, especially one as deep 
and sprawling as “Game of 
Thrones,” is to avoid Internet 
forums. While it’s great to 
dissect every single tiny detail 
of an episode or hatch the most 
elaborate of theories, you’ll 
notice that you will soon drown 
in pools of cynicism and hatred 
among those most invested. 
There’s probably much more 
to say about how that relates to 
the human psyche, but my point 
is: I entered the final season of 
the biggest TV phenomenon in 
history with as clear a mind as 
possible.
“Winterfell,” the premiere 
of the six-episode final season 
of “Game of Thrones” is a 
suitable episode to kick things 
off. Jon Snow (Kit Harington, 
“The Death and Life of John F. 
Donovan”) and his lover/aunt/
queen/breaker of chains/etc. 
Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia 
Clarke, “Solo: A Star Wars 
Story”) arrive in Winterfell 
to more suspicion than pomp. 
Sansa (Sophie Turner, “Josie”), 
now the Lady of Winterfell, 
is one of those suspicious of 
the Targaryen as well as the 
massive 
army 
of 
Dothraki, 
Lannisters and many others 
they have brought with them. 
Meanwhile, in King’s Landing, 
Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asbaek, 
“Borgen”) arrives to form an 
alliance 
with 
Cersei 
(Lena 
Headey, “Thumper”) as well 
as a disturbing relationship of 
sorts.

For better or for worse, “Game 
of Thrones” is a markedly 
different show than it was four 
or five seasons ago. Earlier on, 
showrunners 
David 
Benioff 
(“The Kite Runner”) and D.B. 
Weiss (“It’s Always Sunny in 
Philadelphia”) 
could 
work 
entirely off of author George 
R.R. 
Martin’s 
complicated 

narratives of political intrigue 
and family feuds to great 
effect. Now, with no source 
material to feed off of and the 
show’s worldwide success of 
unprecedented levels, “Game 
of Thrones” is forced to lean 
more 
into 
its 
fantastical, 
spectacular aspects. This does 
have the effect of somewhat 
neutering a few of the more 
fascinating characters of the 
series like Varys and Tyrion, 
as exemplified by the episode 
opening 
with 
an 
off-color, 
barely funny joke about Varys’s 

lack of genitals. Moreover, the 
dialogue in general has shifted 
more into pithy exchanges of 
one-liners and fanservice.
Nonetheless, 
if 
one 
can 
accept 
these 
fundamental 
changes, what’s left is not 
at 
all 
underwhelming. 
The 
actual performances are, as 
usual, excellent, with Sophie 
Turner’s performance as de 
facto Stark family head Sansa 
being a standout. One of the 
best character arcs in the series 
is seeing the young, naïve Sansa 
turn into an exceedingly mature, 
pragmatic 
and 
intelligent 
leader. Another standout is 
John Bradley (“Patient Zero”), 
who plays Samwell Tarly. In 
particular, the scene in which 
he learns about his father and 
brother’s gruesome end and 
the subsequent scene where he 
reveals to Jon his true family 
heritage are some of the best 
peformances 
ever 
seen 
on 
“Game of Thrones.”
On the flip side, Euron, 
after all this time, is still 
an impossibly dull and one-
dimensional 
character, 
especially compared to his 
siblings Theon (Alfie Allen, 
“The 
Predator”) 
and 
Yara 
(Gemma Whelan, “The End 
of the F***ing World”). While 
Clarke is tasked with playing 
one 
of 
the 
most 
popular 
characters on the show, she is 
given little material to work 
with in a compelling manner 
and her scenes with Harington 
are rarely full of chemistry.
“Game of Thrones” has five 
episodes left to bring an end to 
its glorious run. I expect the 
next few to be action-filled and 
epic, and we can all expect to 
enjoy them — even if some or 
many of us miss the political 
thriller of old.

Design by Jack Silberman

As the first of two games on Sunday 

wound down, it wasn’t entirely clear which 
team would come out on top. It was tied, 
2-2, in the seventh inning, and neither 
Michigan nor Northwestern had mustered 
any offense.

Then, junior center fielder Christian 

Bullock sprung to action.

For the second time that game, he 

worked his way to third base after stealing 
second and advancing on the ensuing 
throwing error. Wildcat second baseman 
Alex Erro couldn’t handle sophomore Jack 

Blomgren’s ground ball, and Bullock 

scored the eventual winning run.

“It feels great to score 

winning runs for this 

team,” Bullock 

said. “And to 

score the 

winning 
run feels 

amazing.”

The 3-2 win over Big Ten foe Northwestern 

(16-19 overall, 5-6 Big Ten) was the first of the 
day, as the Wolverines (27-11, 7-3) established 
their dominance by taking the second game 
of the double header, 10-1 to complete a three-
game sweep.

In both games, Michigan got off to a hot 

start.

In the first game, the offense 

manufactured two runs in the first two 
innings to go up 2-0. The first came from 
sophomore designated hitter Jordan Nwogu 
after he had extended his hit streak to nine 
games with a leadoff single and was advanced 
to third. An error by Wildcat third baseman 
Charlie Maxwell allowed the run to score. 
Bullock scored in a nearly identical way to 
the seventh, forcing his way to third base and 
then coming home on a single.

“The two bases that (Bullock) stole in 

the first game, the throw got away from the 
fielders and he was able to advance to third 
on an error and scored both times,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. “So just by being 
aggressive we had huge opportunities, and we 
certainly needed it.”

In the later game, runs didn’t need to be 

manufactured, two home runs in the second 
inning — senior outfielder Blake Nelson’s first 
career home run and Bullock’s first of the 
season, a three-run shot to right field — gave 
the Wolverines a 4-0 lead and they never 
looked back.

It ended up being a career day for 

Bullock, who found himself 
behind strong 
offensive and 
defensive 
starters. 
But with 
junior 

outfielder Jordan Brewer and sophomore 
outfielder Jesse Franklin struggling with 
injuries, Bullock proved he can play, totaling 
three runs and four RBI.

“Coach is always telling me to stay ready,” 

Bullock said, “and is always working on me 
in the morning and at night in the evening 
practice just staying ready for the next 
opportunity.

“ … I know (my speed) is a game changer 

and coach always tells me to use it as much as 
possible so I can score runs.”

Added Bakich: “Everybody likes playing 

with a lead. It allows everybody to breathe 
a little bit and play a little bit looser. Every 
team in college baseball plays better with the 
lead than playing with a deficit. You can be 
aggressive, you can take chances, you don’t 
have to be quite as conservative.”

Northwestern didn’t give up when it got 

down, though, battling back in the first game. 
It tied the game 2-2 with a pair of two-out 
runs in the third inning after sophomore 
shortstop Jack Blomgren missed a double 
play throw to first base.

It had less success in the second game. 

The Wildcats only managed to score one 
run, unable to cut into the early lead as the 
Michigan defense routinely made plays like 
the one Blomgren missed.

Three double plays in three different ways 

quickly snuffed out any hope of offense that 
Northwestern could muster.

E

very email I’ve ever sent 
to the sports staff has 
ended with some varia-
tion of “I love 
you.”
To some, 
that probably 
seems like 
an unpro-
fessional, 
aggressive 
overuse of 
the term “I 
love you.” 
Under other 
circum-
stances, I might agree. But I 
don’t agree here, because: a) 
it’s absurd for anyone to limit 
their allotted number of “I love 
yous” in this lifetime, especial-
ly if you really, truly mean it, 
and b) I really, truly meant it.
My “I love yous” were never 
included on the basis of say-
ing it just to say it. They were 
included because I meant it, 
from the bottom of my heart, 
every single time. 
I have so much love for The 
Daily, for the sports staff and 
for everyone who has ever con-
tributed in any capacity to this 
institution. It’s kind of hard to 
explain why, because to a lot 
of people, this is probably just 
a student newspaper. It’s just 
like any other organization 
on this campus: It’s a creative 
outlet, it’s an extracurricular, 
it adds a little spice to students’ 
resumes, something fun to talk 
about in interviews.
Not for me. 
For me, The Daily is so, so 
much more. For being a student 
journalist, it’s a little ridiculous 
that I’m sitting here struggling 
to string together coherent sen-
tences that accurately convey 
The Daily’s importance to me. 
It should be easy to explain, 
but it’s not. The only way to 
explain it, I think, is to explain 
why The Daily is a large part of 
the reason I’m graduating from 
Michigan in two weeks. 
In high school, my plan was 

commmunity college. I applied 
to Michigan on a whim, and 
only decided to come here after 
the love of my life (financial 
aid) came through. But when I 
first got here, I realized I knew 
no one, and I was as academi-
cally ill-prepared as humanly 
possible.
I quite literally hated it. 
Everything about Michigan 
was different from my little 
village back home — my econ 
class was bigger than my high 
school graduating class, by a 
lot. I knew maybe three people? 
The lowest-level math class you 
could take was pre-calculus, 
which was still two levels too 
high for me. I failed two of 
those exams in a row, and nei-
ther of my parents had gone to 
college, so I felt like I had no 
one to talk to about it. 
And, to top it all off, I got 
sunburnt at every single god-
damn football game.
I was ready to transfer. I 
was going to go anywhere else. 
Michigan was not my home. I 
hadn’t even planned on going 
anywhere other than commu-
nity college in the first place. I 
did not sign up for this. 
Instead of transferring, 
though, I signed up for The 
Daily. It was 
kind of a last-
ditch effort 
to stay at 
Michigan, and 
I did techni-
cally only join 
because I was 
binge-watching 
Gilmore Girls 
at the time and 
Rory wrote 
for her school 
paper, but that’s not important. 
Because when Ted and Kevin 
started offering to help me 
with my math homework, and 
when Avi offered to meet me 
at South Quad for lunch before 
volleyball, and when Kelly gave 
me every piece of advice she 
had, I realized that there was 

a reason for me to stay on cam-
pus and give it another chance. 
My rocky start wasn’t at all 
indicative of the life I’d have 
at Michigan, and that chance 
I took on staying has given me 
the best four years of my life. I 
flew with the hockey team to 
Madison and State College, and 
I drove to Ohio State my senior 
year to cover a football game 
with four amazing friends. We 
went to the Peach Bowl last 
December where we met Mel, 
and if you haven’t met Mel 
(which you probably haven’t), 
just know he makes mean 
peach booze slushie. 
Joining The Daily carried me 
through Michigan. It taught me 
that going out of my comfort 
zone and attending a four-
year university had been hard, 
but exactly what I needed to 
grow as a person. It gave me 
the chance to start collecting 
coffee mugs at every school I 
went to, whether that was to 
cover a sport or for some other 
random, unimportant reason, 
in hopes that my future kids 
will grow up and see these 
mugs and not think twice about 
going to college.
(I don’t have an Ohio State 
mug, but that’s not my fault. I 
tried to buy one 
at both a hockey 
and football 
game. Their 
stores only car-
ried fake buck-
eyes and foam 
fingers.)
The Daily 
gave me a home 
in a place where 
I felt like I 
didn’t have one, 
and now I can’t imagine hav-
ing gone anywhere else. That’s 
why I have an absurd amount 
of love for these people, and 
why I don’t care that ending 
every email with “I love you” 
was probably unnecessary and 
ridiculous.
What I do care about is that 

everyone on this staff — every 
freshman, every senior, every 
junior and every sophomore — 
knows that they are a part of 
one of the best experiences on 
this campus.
At this point, it’s important 
to note that I tried to write 
this column a million times 
and couldn’t figure out what I 
wanted to say. A couple nights 
ago, I asked a former MSE how 
to best approach this column, 
and he said to write it for your-
self — not for anyone else. 
I kept thinking about what I 
wanted to say. What I needed, 
not what anyone else needed. 
All I could think of, though, 
was how much I loved every-
one, how grateful I am that I 
got to be a part of something so 
special for these four years. 
So, really, this column is just 
a 1,000-word extension of my 
senior goodbye from back in 
December. Oops.
In reality, that’s probably 
because I wasn’t really ready 
to say goodbye back then. I 
couldn’t write that goodbye 
in its entirety because saying 
goodbye meant I was done here 

at Michigan, and I wasn’t ready 
to be done. 
But, I think I am now. So, let 
me finish by wrapping up a few 
things I left unsaid:
Megan and Lauren, thanks 
for putting up with me (and 
The Daily). I can’t believe we 
made it through four years 
together even though we went 
in blind freshman year. I’m 
happy none of 
our fights over 
plastic bags 
and dishes ever 
had serious 
consequences. 
Thanks, 
Mrs. John-
son and Mrs. 
Jarrad, for 
calling Michi-
gan’s office of 
financial aid 
every day after I got accepted 
to find a way to get me here. 
Thanks, Christopher Loben-
herz, for picking up the phone 
one of those days and helping 
an unaccompanied homeless 
youth get to college. 
Turns out, I don’t have any 
big-picture theme or advice to 

give, mostly because I’m 22 and 
really don’t need that kind of 
liability on my hands. But I do 
want to say thank you, and not 
just to The Daily. Thank you if 
you read a story, if you were a 
professor who went out of your 
way to help me, if you were a 
GSI who didn’t fail me in pre-
calculus even if you probably 
should have.
Thank you all 
for being here, 
for being a part 
of this commu-
nity, for reading 
this incoherent 
goodbye col-
umn. Thank you, 
everyone, for 
doing whatever 
it is that you did 
to help me get to 
where I am today. 
I love you.

Twitter @laneybyler or by email

to thank you (obviously) for

ridiculously emotional last column.

Time to turn the lights out
A

fter a basketball game 
is finished, and the fans 
have left, some media 
members prefer to work in the 
media room.
I always 
try to go back 
to the press 
box, partially 
because I 
work better 
by myself, 
but mostly 
because there 
is nothing 
like an empty 
stadium. 
Where there was deafening 
noise and heart-stopping action 
mere hours earlier, now there is 
silence.
It helps my creativity for 
working and fuels my nostalgia 
when I’m done.
Over the last four years, from 
hockey to football, I’ve been 
lucky enough to walk around 
Joe Louis Arena, the Dean 
Dome, Mackey Arena, Madison 
Square Garden, the Alamodome, 
Mercedes-Benz Stadium and 
yes, Michigan Stadium. All 
empty. All magnificent.
In the basketball arenas, 
I think of my dad, Mike. He 
taught me how to shoot a jump-
shot and drove me all around 
hell and back for tournaments 
and games over the years, shar-
ing stories and advice like only a 
dad can do.
In the football stadiums, I 
think of my mom, Martha, who 
I remember yelling at the televi-
sion on fall Saturdays and tear-
ing up at the Michigan marching 
band during post-game perfor-
mances when we came to games 
in Ann Arbor years ago. She has 
always been there for me, in the 
stands for the easy times and in 
the trenches for the hard ones.
I look around these stadiums 
and think of my parents, the 
role they’ve played in getting 
me here and how much I wish I 
could show them these experi-
ences in person.
I liked to sit for a while by 
myself after running produc-
tions at The Daily last year, too. 
The posters around the room 

from past Managing Editors are 
a little like jerseys hung in raf-
ters. I think of myself here, and 
how I’ve somehow found a place 
in the history of this 128-year-
old newspaper.
Both experiences settle me 
down and give me the slightest 
sense of imposter syndrome. 
They are my two first thoughts 
when I think of my “happy 
place.”
The difference is that, if all 
goes well, more stadiums will 
be in my future. A silent, empty 
Stanford Lipsey Student Pub-
lications Building at 2:00 a.m. 
will not.
***
From a young age, I would 
wake up early in the morning 
to watch SportsCenter. When 
it ended, I would watch the 
next episode, which was just an 
exact repeat of the one I had just 
watched.
In those days, sports were 
synonymous with Michigan 
sports to me, and I never really 
had a choice.
My grandpa — Gumpa, as his 
grandkids called him — attend-
ed Michigan, and from there, I 
think my fate was preordained.
So I grew up with maize and 
blue everything. In Sunday 
School as a child, I colored a 
picture of Jesus Christ maize 
and blue.
I used to play catch with 
Gumpa in my grandparents’ 
living room with a little, blue, 
plastic football for hours. I’d say 
I was Marquise Walker (the real 
ones will remember) or Braylon 
Edwards or some other Wolver-
ines receiver, as I dove into their 
couches making one-handed 
catches.
I always thought I would be 
a Michigan athlete one day. Of 
course, that dream was dashed, 
because I am not close to 
D-1-caliber at anything, though 
I do hold my own on the IM 
courts.
Time passed, and it eventu-
ally came time to apply for col-
lege. I thought for a second that 
I might want to go somewhere 
else. I knew sports journalism 
was my interest and that Michi-

gan didn’t have a journalism 
major.
But when I actually got 
accepted here, I don’t even think 
I had to tell my parents where 
I wanted to go. They probably 
knew I’d end up in Ann Arbor 
before I did.
The sports journalism aspect 
took care of itself, too.
At Festifall my freshman 
year, I was actually looking for 
the WCBN table — I thought 
I wanted to do radio or televi-
sion. But I stumbled across The 
Daily’s table, where then-MSE 
Max Cohen was standing.
He asked me if he could be 
honest with me, and his pitch 
was something along the lines 
of, “We’re the best fucking stu-
dent newspaper in the country, 
and we’ll get you a job.”
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, 
I was sold, and the rest is his-
tory.
Gumpa passed when I was 
nine. I’d give anything to tell 
him about the last four years.
***
I remember when my Dad 
was laid off. He is a press opera-
tor, and I was too 
young to have it 
explained to me 
fully, but he spent 
time at home for a 
while. Mom is an 
elementary school 
teacher, and we 
got by.
I also remem-
ber taking a 
drive one day. 
My parents, my 
two sisters — Katie and Mary 
— and I packed into our car and 
drove about five minutes away 
from home, pulling down a long 
driveway into the woods. At the 
end of it was a small house. We 
were moving here, away from 
my childhood home, to this air-
condition-less, fresh-water-less 
place.
I know I didn’t take that 
change well, and I imagine my 
reaction didn’t make things easy 
on my parents. I realize now 
that the move was partially for 
me.
Mom and Dad have always 

told us kids not to worry about 
the costs of things, because we’ll 
make it work.
When I wanted to play AAU 
basketball, they figured out a 
way to pay for it. When Katie 
decided on Western Michigan, 
and I decided on Michigan, they 
figured out a way to pay for it. 
When Mary gets into Harvard 
or Oxford or something, they’ll 
figure out a way to pay for it. 
When I got my first internship 
in Colorado Springs, my Dad 
got in my shitty, old car with 
me and drove through the night 
to Colorado to make sure I got 
there safe.
I don’t write any of this 
because I think I’m special, or 
for pity’s sake. I recognize there 
are thousands of kids and par-
ents who have to grind to make 
ends meet.
I tell these stories because I 
am so, incredibly lucky to have 
the parents I do. They deserve 
so much credit. Truthfully, they 
deserve so much more than that.
No matter how many times 
I’ve been down to my last dol-
lar, scrambling to pay rent, they 
kept a promise. 
We’ve always 
made it work.
So I’ll repeat 
what I said 
in my Senior 
Goodbye.
Mom and 
Dad, one day I 
swear it will all 
be worth it.
***
I’ve said a 
fair number of goodbyes in my 
life, and I’ve sucked at all of 
them. 
The last football game I 
attended as a fan was Michi-
gan’s loss to Ohio State in 2017. 
My friends went home before 
me, and when the final whistle 
blew, I made my way to the 
50-yard line. In the shadow of 
the press box, I watched the 
marching band’s postgame show 
and cried.
At the end of my MSE tenure, 
I went home for a family wed-
ding. I was tired. A year of this 
job takes something out of you. I 

had a long talk with Mom about 
school and The Daily and my 
own mental health, and I cried 
then too. I wasn’t ready to be 
done with The Daily, and I’m 
still not. I’m certainly not ready 
to be done with Michigan.
And that’s why this goodbye 
is especially painful.
Because, even if those other 
ones were “lasts” for specific 
situations, I still had time left.
For this one, I have two 
weeks, and then nothing will 
ever be the same as it was these 
last four years.
When I would sit at The Daily 
on those late nights, I would 
leave and walk through the 
silent campus. The walk was 
better before The Union was 
under construction, but it’s still 
pretty good.
Maybe after the stories I’ve 
already told, it’s a surprise I

I’ll remember The Daily for

never once dreaded walking

else was going on in my life. For 
a year, that staff — the best god-

It was the biggest factor in 
the best four years of my life.

It is the worst part.

McCallum wins national title as 
Michigan finishes in fourth place

Anthony 
McCallum 
stood 
at the end of the runway, 
visualizing himself sticking his 
Tsukahara double pike vault. 
Five seconds later, he landed it, 
for the final time in his Michigan 
men’s gymnastics career, with 
his feet glued to the floor.
All gymnasts strive for stuck 
landings, and this time, it won 
the senior his third national 
title on vault with a score of 
15.266 — just 0.434 below his 
maximum score. In a sport 
where even the smallest errors 
incur deductions, that’s about as 
good as it gets. 
“It doesn’t feel real yet,” 
McCallum said. “It just feels 
really good to end it the way I 
envisioned it to end. So many 
other things could’ve happened. 
It just feels good to make my 
legacy even better than it was 
before and finish off the way 
that I wanted to.”
After winning the title on 
vault both his freshman and 
sophomore 
years, 
McCallum 
missed the majority of the 2018 
season with an injury. That year, 
he scored just a 14.000 in the 
qualifying round at the NCAA 
Championships and failed to 
advance to the vault final. 
In 
Friday’s 
qualifying 
session, 
McCallum 
again 
marked a 14.000 after putting 
his hands down when landing, 
but he advanced to Saturday’s 
final because the Wolverines 
qualified as a team. Michigan 
ultimately finished fourth of six 
teams with a score of 406.354. 
“Yesterday, he had trouble 
with his vault,” said Michigan 
coach Kurt Golder on Saturday. 
“It’s just such a difficult vault, 
but for him to stick it today — 
you know, it’s the last vault he’ll 
ever do for Michigan and he 
sticks it and wins the national 
title. Doesn’t get much better 

than that.”
For the first time in his 
NCAA Championships career, 
McCallum competed alongside 
his teammates in the final 
round of competition. Until 
Friday, the Wolverines had not 
made it to the second day of the 
championships as a team since 
2015.
“It was really exciting being 
with 
the 
team,” 
McCallum 
said. “In the past, the other 
times that I’ve won, it was as 
an individual. I really was just 
thinking about the team and 
that ended up bringing out the 
best competition in myself.”
McCallum’s score propelled 
Michigan to a score of 73.264 
on the vault and made the 
Wolverines just the second team 
this season to score above 73.
But despite the high scores 
on vault, Michigan couldn’t 
overcome low scores on pommel 
horse and high bar.
“Anytime you can (make it 
to the Super Six), you’ve gotta 
be happy,” Golder said. “Just 
didn’t do quite what we were 
capable of, and of course that’s 
what you want in a national 
championship.”
While the Wolverines didn’t 
find much success as a team, 
three of McCallum’s teammates 
joined him as All-Americans 
after placing in the top eight on 

their respective events.
Fifth-year 
senior 
Marty 
Strech earned a seventh-place 
finish on the still rings for his 
routine that he capped with 
a stuck dismount. Michigan 
competed 
on 
rings 
in 
the 
second rotation on Saturday, 
and Strech’s score of 14.300 
remained in podium position 
throughout the competition.
“(Strech is) just so clean,” 
Golder said. “He doesn’t have a 
great start value. There’s a lot of 
guys with a higher start value, 
but he executes so well that it 
doesn’t surprise me at all. It’s 
nice to see in a big championship 
meet that he holds up pretty 
well.”
Sophomores 
Jacob 
Moore 
and Cameron Bock also earned 
All-American honors. Moore 
finished in third place on floor 
exercise and Bock placed fourth 
in the all-around.
Although Michigan earned 
high scores from gymnasts 
like McCallum and Moore, its 
overall struggles in the team 
competition left the Wolverines 
scoring more than two points 
below their season average.
But it was Michigan’s first trip 
to the Super Six since 2015, and 
for a program that’s won three 
national titles this decade, it was 
an important step toward being 
a national contender again.

Offense leads Wolverines to sweep

Any good team needs players 
to step up when others aren’t at 
their best. 
The No. 22 Michigan softball 
team (33-11 overall, 15-1 Big Ten) 
proved its mettle this weekend, 
coming out ahead in all three 
contests against Illinois (27-
17, 6-9) this weekend despite 
uncharacteristically 
poor 
pitching. 
The bats started slow in the 
series. Friday’s game was low-
scoring on both sides, ending 
with a final score of 2-1. The first 
of these runs came in the first 
inning when senior first baseman 
Alex Sobczak fired a ball deep into 
center field, driving in freshman 
outfielder Lexie Blair from first. 
Both 
Sobczak 
and 
Blair 
continued to be assets offensively 
as the weekend continued. They 
combined for nine hits over 
the course of the weekend and 
had back-to-back homers in the 
fourth inning of Sunday’s game. 
The energy picked up on 
Saturday, when the Wolverines 
edged out the Illini, 9-8. Two 
runs in the first inning got the 
ball rolling for Michigan, but it 
lost the momentum, failing to 
score another run until the fifth. 
By then, the Wolverines faced a 
four-run deficit. But they didn’t 
let it faze them. 
In the fifth inning, a single 
by 
Blair 
allowed 
sophomore 
shortstop Natalia Rodriguez to 
score, and from there, the runs 
kept coming. In the sixth inning, 
junior third baseman Madison 
Uden blasted a ball over the 
center field wall, further chipping 
away at Illinois’ lead. In the 
seventh inning, a double hit down 
the third base line by Canfield 
sent two runners home, putting 
Michigan one run ahead by the 
game’s close. 
“I think we’re just getting 
better and we’re just fighting,” 
said senior second baseman Faith 
Canfield. “They’re going to throw 
a punch, we’ve got to throw a 

punch back. This weekend, we 
trusted our ability to do that.” 
“Saturday, we saw that (Illinois 
pitcher) again and we made some 
adjustments,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “It made a 
difference. You have to do what it 
takes to win.”
By Sunday, the Wolverines’ 
offense virtually functioned as a 
carousel, sending runners around 
the bases one after the next in a 
game that ended in a 16-5 victory. 
Michigan took a commanding 
lead in the first inning with 
five runs, which included two 
of the day’s six home runs — 
by 
senior 
designated 
player 
Mackenzie Nemitz and junior 
outfielder 
Haley 
Hoogenraad. 
The Wolverines didn’t let up, 
amassing a total of 17 hits by the 
end of the contest. 
“Our offense throughout the 
weekend improved just within 
the three games,” Blair said. 
“That’s just from staying within 
ourselves, knowing we can pick 
each other up if someone can’t get 
the job done.” 
While the Wolverines’ hitting 
improved as the weekend wore 
on, the same couldn’t be said of 
their pitching. 
Friday, sophomore left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien gave up just 
three hits in seven innings, one 
of which translated into a run. 
Saturday’s game was a different 
story. She entered in relief in the 
sixth inning and gave up two 

runs before pitching a scoreless 
seventh. 
The pitching staff as a whole 
struggled in the second game. 
Hutchins pulled freshman right-
hander Alex Storako after she 
gave up three runs and loaded the 
bases in the bottom of the third 
inning. This has become standard 
practice for Storako, who has 
rarely gotten beyond the third 
or fourth inning without being 
substituted out. 
Unlike past games, Storako 
was switched back in less than 
an inning later after sophomore 
right-hander Schaefer gave up 
three more runs and loaded the 
bases in the fourth. This wouldn’t 
be 
Michigan’s 
last 
pitching 
change. Hutchins opted to swap 
Storako out again — this time for 
Beaubien. Despite her struggles 
in the sixth, Beaubien held off the 
Illini in the seventh, preserving 
the Wolverines’ narrow lead. 
The 
pitchers’ 
struggles 
followed them into Sunday’s 
game, in which Beaubien started 
in the circle. She gave up five runs 
before Storako came in for relief 
in the last inning. 
Luckily for the Wolverines, 
the offense’s production kept 
Michigan afloat. 
“Our offense had our pitchers’ 
backs,” Hutchins said. “Some 
days the hitters have to pick 
up the pitchers and some days 
the pitchers have to pick up the 
hitters.”

From sprinter to marathon runner, Jeff Criswell grows into starting role

It’s a completely different 
ballgame. 
That’s what Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich will say, what 
pitching coach Chris Fetter 
will say, what sophomore right-
hander Jeff Criswell will say 
about transitioning from the 
bullpen to a starting role. 
“It’s going from the mindset 
of being a sprinter to a marathon 
runner,” Bakich said. “It’s a 
totally different way of training, 
a totally different mindset. You 
go from an adrenaline junkie 
who’s gonna go blow it out for 
one inning to a guy who still 
needs 
to 
have 
his best stuff and 
pitch with his 
best intent, but 
who has to do it 
over six or seven 
innings 
every 
time he goes out 
there.”
That’s 
the 
challenge 
that 
Criswell 
has 
faced this season. 
With 
sophomore 
left-hander 
Ben Dragani injured, Criswell 
was next up to fill the No. 3 
spot in the Wolverines’ rotation 
behind 
junior 
left-hander 
Tommy Henry and junior right-
hander Karl Kauffman. His solid 
performance out of the bullpen 
last year — a 2.23 earned run 
average and 32 strikeouts over 
32.1 innings pitched — made 
him the natural choice.
He hadn’t been a starter since 
high school, though. Criswell 
pitched in relief all of his 
freshman year, and all of last 
summer. He only threw more 
than two innings once in his 24 
outings and 32.1 total innings 
last year.
But over his nine starts this 
season, Criswell has virtually 
erased all of those concerns. He 
hasn’t allowed an earned run in 
almost a month, since his March 
23 start against No. 16 Texas 
Tech. He struck out 12 batters 
in Dodger Stadium against a 
formidable 
Oklahoma 
State 
squad on the tail end of a long 
and difficult California swing. 

So far, he’s given up just five 
extra-base hits on the season 
over 45.2 innings of work.
His pitches — what Fetter 
called a “major-league” fastball, 
and a changeup and slider that 
are already strong — are looking 
better than ever. And with the 
work Criswell and Fetter have 
been putting in, they’re just 
continuing to get stronger. 
“On any one day, you’ll see 
three pitches from Jeff that 
could be at the highest level,” 
Fetter said.
Criswell has gone at least 
five innings in all but two of his 
starts. The two exceptions: 4.2 
innings against the Red Raiders 
— easily among the toughest 
competition 
Michigan 
has 
faced 
this 
season 
— 
and 
two innings in a 
midweek 
game 
against Toledo. 
As 
the 
season has gone 
on, 
Criswell 
has 
grown 
increasingly 
comfortable 
going later into games. Over 
his first four starts, he only 
went six innings once. In the 
five starts since, he’s made it 
almost seven full innings twice. 
Now, Criswell and Fetter are 
looking to bring that to eight 
and eventually maybe even nine. 
The 
Sunday 
after 
that 
Wednesday start against the 
Rockets, 
Criswell 
went 
6.2 
innings against a Minnesota 
team 
that 
is 
among 
the 
Wolverines’ biggest competition 
in the Big Ten. With the series 
tied at the game apiece, the 
Wolverines needed a win to 
take the home series and keep 
up their momentum in one of 
the toughest stretches of their 
schedule. Criswell held the 
Golden Gophers to three hits 
and no runs while striking out 
eight — on three days’ rest. 
A week later, he took the 
mound at Ohio State as the 
Wolverines tried to stave off 
a sweep by their archrivals. 
Again, 
Criswell 
went 
6.2 
innings, striking out four and 
not allowing a single extra-base 

hit as Michigan went on to win, 
6-2, in what Fetter called his 
best outing of the season.
“With Minnesota and Ohio 
State, you can see his growth; 
you can see his improvement,” 
Bakich said. “It’s been very 
impressive, and 
we’ve certainly 
needed 
it. 
Having a guy 
like 
Jeff 
on 
Sunday gives us 
a great chance 
to win or sweep 
every 
series 
that we play.”
But 
transitioning 
from a one-or-
two-inning reliever to a six-or-
seven-inning 
starter 
doesn’t 
happen overnight, even for a 
player with starting experience. 
Criswell and Fetter have been 
working 
on 
extending 
the 
pitcher’s outings — and keeping 
his pitches up over longer 
stretches — since August.
They’ve 
smoothed 
out 

Criswell’s delivery, streamlined 
his motion, and put an emphasis 
on delivering power from the 
legs — changes targeted at 
delivering the same pitches but 
using less energy. 
“Because he’s using his legs 
more, and because 
he’s more efficient 
in what he’s doing 
delivery-wise, 
he’s able to go 
much deeper in 
the game,” Fetter 
said. “He’s still 
showing the same 
stuff he had last 
year in one-inning 
stints, 
but 
he’s 
able to maintain 
that now for six, seven innings.”
The 
bigger 
challenge 
for 
Criswell has been adopting the 
mindset of a starter. After a year 
in a closing role, the adjustment 
back to longer outings was 
tough, not just physically, but 
mentally.
“The biggest thing with Jeff 
was trying to convince him, 

‘Hey, you’re still a closer in your 
mentality. We’re just gonna 
close out the first inning, and 
then the second inning, close 
out the third inning, and keep 
that up and not look at the 
long picture about trying to go 
deep into a game and conserve 
energy,’” Fetter said. “You’re 
still using the same amount 
of energy, the same amount of 
force. You’re just trying to close 
out each inning now instead of 
just one.”
Henry and Kauffmann, both 
of whom started last year as 
well, have also helped Criswell 
make the transition. A converted 
closer, 
Criswell’s 
adjustment 
centered around mentality more 
than anything else.
“It 
was 
definitely 
very 
different for me, but Coach 
Fetter, Tommy Henry and Karl 
Kauffmann have all been huge 
in helping me along,” Criswell 
said. “Karl and Tommy both 
have a couple more years of 
experience than I do in the 
starting role, and those guys 

have been absolutely great to 
me. With their help, and the 
work I’ve done with Coach 
Fetter, it’s just been really good 
for me.”
As the Wolverines head into 
the final stretch of their season, 
having Criswell dominate like 
this in that Sunday-starter role 
is more important than ever. 
The Big Ten race is tightening 
up, with Nebraska, Indiana and 
Iowa all looking like strong 
contenders. 
But if Criswell can keep 
up this improvement — and 
Bakich and Fetter have both 
expressed 
every 
confidence 
that he can — the Wolverines 
have the potential to be serious 
competitors for the conference 
title too, and maybe even a 
postseason run.
“I’m ready to go,” Criswell 
said. “We’re excited to continue 
into Big Ten play, and we know 
that we’ve got some work to do, 
but we’re going to be ready for 
the next couple weeks to come. 
I’m excited.”

4B — April 22, 2019
SportsMonday
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

It was easy to be skeptical a 
month ago. Jim Harbaugh has 
adapted, but he has never given 
up control, at least not in this way. 
Michigan’s offense has always 
been his, and before that, so was 
the 49ers’, Stanford’s and the 
University of San Diego’s. Hiring 
Josh Gattis to be his offensive 
coordinator was one thing. Letting 
him coordinate the offense was, 
entirely, another.
Still, 
that’s 
exactly 
what 
Harbaugh committed to doing.
“He’s 
going 
to 
coordinate 
the offense and call the plays,” 
Harbaugh said on March 18, when 
asked exactly what it meant to give 
Gattis the keys to the offense. “And 
that’s what that means.”
And, at least through spring 
ball, that’s what it has been.
After 15 practices, about 90 
percent of Gattis’ offense has been 
installed, he said Friday afternoon. 
That offense, entirely, belongs to 
Gattis.
“(Harbaugh) 
hasn’t 
been 
involved at all,” Gattis said. “He 
hasn’t stepped in.”
With the offense run to Gattis’ 
liking, it took three or four 
practices into the spring before 
Michigan had things down. The 
new elements — run-pass options, 
no-huddle and the like — weren’t 
all too hard to pick up, according to 
most players after the spring game.
The hard part, Gattis said, was 
going against Michigan’s defense 
every day in practice.
“You look at the average defense, 
you gotta go in throughout the year 
and they’re gonna be a four-down, 
they’re gonna be a static front in 
static coverage,” Gattis said. “Our 
defense presents a number of 
different challenges. So once we 
were able to able to apply our roles 
and they were able to learn the 
installs and then learn the rules 
going against our defense, you were 
able to see a lot of successful plays 
happen from that standpoint.”
As defensive coordinator Don 

Brown pointed out just after Gattis 
finished talking, the Wolverines 
are a package defense. There’s 
little trickery going on — they’re 
going to play man coverage and 
dare you to beat them. And with 
90 percent of the offense installed, 
the other 10 will be determined, in 
part, by what doesn’t work against 
Michigan’s defense.
Otherwise, 
it’s 
formations 
Gattis wants to add and things he 
wants to build on that have yet to 
be taught.
“One of the things to our 
advantage in this offense is the 
flexibility,” 
Gattis 
said. 
“This 
offense is what I call like a mutt of 
a dog. It’s got — it’s the pretty dog 
walking down the road and you’re 
trying to figure out, what kind of 
dog is it? And for us, we do a little 
bit of everything.”
At one point, as Gattis extolled 
his belief in the offense, Brown 
was standing about 20 feet to the 
side, behind a secretary’s desk. He 
was leaning down, arms crossed 
and eyes trained forward, out the 
door — a picture of intensity.
As his defense has sharpened 
Gattis this spring, so too has Gattis’ 
offense sharpened him.

“I think coach Gattis has done 
a great job of, got those guys going 
fast,” Brown said. “Which, that 
certainly helps us. … You better 
get up to speed, be running with 
a sense of urgency to get lined up 
and all those things. So, I think that 
part of it’s been really tremendous 
for us.”
And where is Harbaugh in all of 
this?
“He’s the CEO,” Brown said. 
“He’s running the program.”
That, according to Brown, 
means maximizing repetitions, 
keeping everyone on their toes 
and managing the bigger picture. 
It doesn’t include the thing 
Harbaugh has built his career on — 
running the offense.
During the spring game, Gattis 
called all the plays, and not off a 
script. Gattis doesn’t need one, he 
said, because this is his offense, 
and he knows what to do and 
when. This is his show.
“A lot of people have put a lot of 
questions and comments out there 
in the spring,” Gattis said. “This is 
a sign of what great head coaches 
do. They’re willing to change.”
For now, Harbaugh has done 
just that.

While Don Brown spoke to 
the media in Schembechler Hall 
on Friday afternoon, senior 
linebacker 
Khaleke 
Hudson 
walked down a hallway about 
20 yards over Brown’s shoulder.
As Hudson began to walk out 
the door and onto State Street, 
he paused, flashed a smile and 
pointed at Brown, bestowing a 
gesture of “You the man” on his 
defensive coordinator.
This is, after all, how just 
about everybody inside these 
halls feels about Brown. And 
it’s why — after losing eight 
defensive starters from a year 
ago — Michigan has no shortage 
of confidence in its defense.
“When you look at coach 
Brown’s track record, I would 
argue he’s the best defensive 
coordinator in the country,” 
said 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh Gattis. “He’s constantly 
produced top defenses year in 
and year out, no matter where 
he’s been.”
Regardless of the man in 
charge, losing eight starters, 

including all four along the 
defensive line, poses a daunting 
challenge. 
Brown, 
though, 
has been through this before. 
“(After) last season was really 
like a picnic (compared to) 
after the ‘16 season, in terms 
of changing guys,” he said. 
And like it did then, Brown’s 
adjustment has come down to 
finding schemes that work with 
his new personnel. 
Solidifying schemes is even 
more important in Brown’s 
defense than in most. Gattis, 
in his first month practicing 
against 
Brown’s 
defense, 
said the toughest challenge 
his offense faces every day 
in 
practice 
is 
that 
the 
Wolverines 
don’t 
just 
run 
their 
base defense, 
instead 
alternating 
between three 
and 
four-
down 
fronts 
and displaying 
an 
array 
of 
blitz packages, even in spring 
practices.
That ability to mix and match 
packages 
to 
his 
personnel, 
though, 
has 
helped 
Brown 
mitigate the impact felt by 
Michigan’s losses from a year 
ago.
“I think this is gonna be an 
interesting group defensively,” 
Brown said. “We may be a little 
different, because we may have 
more guys like, ‘This guy’s good 
at this, that guy’s good at that.’ 
So you might have to piece it in 
a little bit like that, but that’s 
the fun part.”
In 
the 
linebacker 
corps 
— 
a 
group 
Brown 
called 
“unbelievable” 
on 
Friday 
despite losing Devin Bush to 
the NFL Draft — mixing and 
matching is less of an option, as 
Brown said he wants to find his 
top three and stick to them in 
most situations. But in the front 

four, the Wolverines will have 
to be more flexible than they 
were last year, when Rashan 
Gary 
and 
Chase 
Winovich 
could slot in at defensive end on 
nearly every down.
Gary’s 
midseason 
injury, 
though, provided a peak of 
what could lie ahead this fall, at 
least at one defensive end spot.
“We found out last year, 
through 
injury,” 
Brown 
said, “that we were able to, 
between (junior defensive end 
Josh Uche) and (sophomore 
defensive end Kwity Paye), 
we’ve got first, second-down 
production out of Kwity and 
third-down production out of 
Josh, which was 
an exciting thing 
for us.”
This 
year, 
those 
types 
of 
splits will become 
more 
common, 
with Bryan Mone 
and 
Lawrence 
Marshall, 
Michigan’s 
two 
interior 
starters 
for much of last 
year, also gone. Beyond Uche 
and Paye, Brown remained 
mum on exactly what those 
splits will be, but Carlo Kemp, 
Michael 
Dwumfour, 
Mazi 
Smith, David Ojabo, Donovan 
Jeter, Aidan Hutchinson and 
Ben Mason were all listed by 
Brown on Friday as part of 
the competition for snaps — 
potentially a deeper group than 
last year’s, even if it lacks the 
first-round edge-rushing talent 
of Gary and Winovich.
But whatever the personnel 
combinations, 
Michigan’s 
confidence 
in 
its 
defense 
remains as persistent as ever. 
And for that, it has one man to 
thank.
“I 
remember 
all 
the 
headaches coach Brown would 
present 
when 
you 
game-
planned against him,” Gattis 
said. “Imagine doing that for 15 
(spring) practices.”

Wolverines place third in NCAA semifinals

Throughout the meet, Bev 
Plocki heard people talking about 
the first session of the NCAA 
Championship semifinals.
The Gauntlet was what they 
called it. There were other names 
the Michigan coach heard, but 
The Gauntlet resonated with her.
It couldn’t have been more 
fitting to describe what the No. 
7 Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team faced in attempts to make 
the NCAA Championship final.
The Wolverines would have 
to finish top two — the finals 
advancement cutoff — in a field 
with No. 2 UCLA, No. 4 LSU and 
No. 6 Utah. Instead, they settled 
for a third place finish, scoring 
197.2000.
And The Gauntlet was only 
part of the struggle they faced.
All season, Michigan battled 
adversity, and its last week of the 
season served the team a heaping 
pile of it — on the final day of 
practice, senior Emma McLean 
broke her hand. McLean played a 
pivotal role in both the vault and 
floor lineups, and without her, 
if the Wolverines wanted a shot 
at the championship, someone 
would have to step up.
“That was a little emotional 
on our last day of practice,” said 
senior Olivia Karas. “To watch 
my best friend go down and know 
that was the end of her career. 
That was pretty hard for me.”
Opening the meet on bars, that 
call was answered. Michigan’s 
lineup featured all four members 
of the freshman class — Abby 
Brenner, Abby Heiskell, Maddie 
Mariani and Natalie Wojcik — 
and all four members contributed 
scores at or above a 9.8000. When 
Karas stepped up to the bars, 
she was calm and confident. She 
swung through the routine with 
ease and stuck her double pike 
landing receiving the highest 
score of the rotation. Altogether 
the Wolverines earned a 49.300 
— and a spot in second place.
“They’re 
amazing 
and 
incredible,” Plocki said. “I said 
to the freshmen, ‘You guys this is 
the beginning of something really 
special.’ They have contributed at 
such an incredible level. I’m so 

excited about how they’ve done.”
Headed to the balance beam, 
the Wolverines hoped to continue 
their streak of clean routines. 
Sophomore Lauren Farley led 
off and performed a routine that 
had a few wobbles and balance 
checks. Farley spent the week 
leading up to nationals in a boot 
with a foot injury. She earned 
a 9.7250. After four polished 
routines that all scored in the 
9.8000 range, the only gymnast 
left was breakout star Wojcik.
From start to finish, Wojcik’s 
routine was nearly flawless. She 
flipped. She jumped. She stuck 
her landing. Her score flashed 
— a 9.9500 — and Wojcik’s name 
topped the beam leaderboard. 
When both semifinal sessions 
concluded, she was crowned the 
NCAA national champion on 
beam.
The solid beam rotation kept 
Michigan in second place, but 
competition was closing in on 
the Wolverines. They were less 
than a tenth of a point behind 
first-place UCLA, and third-place 
LSU was only .0125 points behind 
them.
Headed 
to 
floor 
without 
McLean, Heiskell opened the 
rotation. The freshman tumbled 
her way through the routine 
and started Michigan off strong 
with a 9.8375. Next up was junior 

Maddy Osman. During her second 
tumbling pass, Osman bounced 
out of bounds and received an 
automatic one-tenth deduction. 
Her score was a 9.6500.
The Wolverines turned to 
Brenner, who danced, tumbled 
and entertained the crowd on her 
way to a 9.8500. Wojcik and Karas 
anchored the lineup, and both 
performed routines filled with 
personality and clean tumbling. 
Despite ending the rotation with 
a 9.9000 from Wojcik, a 9.9250 
from Karas and the dropping of 
Osman’s score, Michigan had 
slipped into third place.
“Our whole theme, everything 
we talked about in our team 
meeting last night, and even 
leading into competition was 
all about the fact that I wanted 
them to have fun,” Plocki said. “I 
wanted them to not pay attention 
to what anyone else was doing. I 
wanted them to compete for each 
other and stay in the moment and 
enjoy every moment.”
Just half a tenth behind second-
place LSU, the Wolverines’ last 
chance to earn a qualifying spot 
came down to the apparatus that 
has been their Achilles heel all 
season — the vault.
Michigan 
called 
upon 
its 
freshman class to fill McLean’s 
shoes. 
Heiskell 
started 
the 
rotation off with her Yurchenko 

full and after a small hop on the 
landing, earned a 9.8000. The 
only stuck landing of the rotation 
came from sophomore Anne 
Maxim. Her Tsukahara received 
the highest score of the rotation 
for the Wolverines — a 9.8625.
Wojcik, Brenner and Karas 
couldn’t hold onto the stuck 
landings, and, like Heiskell, took 
small hops. When the scores 
settled, Michigan finished in 
third place with a score of 197.200 
— only .163 behind the Tigers.
Four 
Wolverine 
gymnasts 
earned All-American honors — 
Karas, Wojcik, Osman and Funk. 
Karas led the group with four, 
earning first team honors on the 
uneven bars and floor and second 
team honors on beam and in the 
all-around.
“The people that we were 
competing 
against, 
I 
mean 
nobody 
anticipated 
us 
to 
advance,” 
Plocki 
said. 
“We 
were in second place after two 
events, and only down by a half 
a tenth after three and it just so 
happened that we ended on vault 
which is probably our event that 
we’re most challenged on.
“What this team was able to 
do and the pieces we picked up 
and the fight and determination 
and grit that they had, I’m 
incredibly proud of what we’ve 
accomplished.”

‘M’ finishes seventh

Elodie Van Dievoet teed off 
Sunday morning knowing that 
it could be her last time as a 
Wolverine.
The Michigan women’s golf 
team was a long shot to make the 
NCAA Tournament, needing to 
win the Big Ten Championships 
to do so. But Van Dievoet still had 
a chance to finish her career on a 
high note.
Two years ago at the very same 
location — TPC River’s Bend in 
Maineville, Ohio — Van Dievoet 
secured her place in the record 
books by earning the program’s 
first-ever individual conference 
title. On Friday and Sunday, she 
shot a 142 for two under par and 
finished tied for fifth.
“She’s got a lot of good, positive 
memories from this place and 
loves playing here,” said Michigan 
coach Jan Dowling. “ … She went 
into this tournament with the 
possibility that this is her last 
tournament ever for Michigan 
women’s golf. So that’s kind of a 
tough place to be and really proud 
of her to kinda get really tough 
— and she had a low score — and 
finish with a bang. So we’re proud 
of her round today. It showed 
character.”
Led by Van Dievoet and 
freshman Ashley Lau — who shot 
a 145 to finish tied for 11th — the 
Wolverines 
finished 
seventh 
of 14 teams with a total of 583, 
seven over par, in the weather-
shortened tournament, ultimately 
falling short of the finish required 
to qualify for NCAA Regionals.
On Friday, cold and rainy 
conditions 
slowed 
everything 
down, with all teams at least 
three over par. Michigan sat tied 
for sixth at the end of the day, just 
seven shots behind first-place 
Illinois.
But Saturday, it was colder 
and rainier, rendering the course 
unplayable. 
The 
Wolverines 
waited and waited as tee times 
were pushed back further and 
further, playing cards and doing 
homework to pass the time. 
Ultimately, the second round 
was canceled altogether, and 
Michigan instead got in some 

practice time before dinner with 
the players’ families.
While the canceled second 
round provided some advantage 
in that it meant fewer holes for 
a team like the Fighting Illini to 
gain separation, it was also one 
fewer round in the Wolverines’ 
season.
“It’s not ideal,” Dowling said. 
“We want to be playing 54 holes, 
but that was the scenario that was 
given to us. So we tried to make 
the most of it.”
The cancellation did afford 
Michigan one thing. It spurred 
the Wolverines to adopt an 
aggressive, 
chase-down-the-
leaders mindset Sunday, knowing 
that there was only one day to 
play catch up, instead of two.
Ultimately, 
it 
made 
little 
difference for the team as a whole, 
which finished three under par 
on Sunday to cement its spot in 
the middle of the pack. But for 
Van Dievoet, it paid off.
Sitting in just 14th on Friday, 
Van Dievoet came out Sunday 
and birdied five of 18 holes. She 
crept up the leaderboard with 
each passing turn, at one point 
sitting in third before a bogey on 
the 16th hole landed her just off 
the podium. She shot a 68 in the 
second round, the third-lowest 
score of the day.
Junior 
Alisa 
Snyder 
and 
freshman Sophia Trombetta also 
improved their standings Sunday. 
Snyder shot a 73 to finish four over 
par for the weekend, good enough 
for 
24th 
place. 
Trombetta, 
meanwhile, shot a 72 to shoot up 
from 41st after one day to 33rd 
after two.
Though 
Trombetta 
and 
Snyder punched above their 
weights, what ultimately held 
the Wolverines back was the 
struggles of sophomore Ashley 
Kim. Kim, who recorded the 
second-lowest score in program 
history as a freshman, never 
got into a groove, hitting a few 
loose iron shots and putting well 
below her standards. She shot 76 
on Friday and 77 on Sunday and 
tied for 56th, the lowest-placing 
Michigan golfer.
