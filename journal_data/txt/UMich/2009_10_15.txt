Notion that team
had highest GPA
ever not based on
data, official says
By MATT AARONSON
and JACOB SMILOVITZ
Daily News Editors
Michigan head football coach
Rich Rodriguez distanced himself
yesterday from an assertion he has
made in the past that this year's
team had the program's "highest
GPA ever recorded."
Rodriguez said in a statement
posted yesterday on the Athletic
Department's website that he
made the claim "several" times in
the past. The most notahle among
them was during his Aug. 31 press
conference in which he defended
the program against a Detroit
Free Press story that alleged the
team violated NCAA rules regard-
ing practice time and offseason
workouts.
"They're working hard in ath-
letics, and they're working hard
in academics," Rodriguez said
at the press conference, discuss-
ing his players' work ethic on
and off the field. "And they've
showed that in the balance, in
that endeavor, in the way they've
recorded the highest GPA ever
recorded."
He added: "And as a coach, I am
very, very proud of them."

According to a report in the Free

the Detroit paper made a similar
request.
Both informationrequestswere

"No responsive records exist,"
Patricia Sellinger, the University's
Freedom of Information Act coor-

In a recent interview, Kallie

for communications for the Uni-

the unconfirmed metric as a way
to motivate the team.
"The goal was to motivate his
team," she said, adding thatRodri-

were "motivated academically."

New center to reexamine 'U' ventures now under one roof

child advocacy process

By LAURA BRUNNER
For theDaily
Today, the laws and systems gov-
erning how cases involving a child's
well-being are handled vary from
state to state. But that could all soon
change with the establishment of
a new center at the Law School,
which officials say will overhaul
the way child advocacy operates in
this country.
The University's National Quali-
ty Improvement Center on the Rep-
resentation of Children in the Child
Welfare System was created after
the Law School received a $5 mil-
lion grant from the U.S. Children's
Bureau of Health and Human Ser-
vices.
The new center will focus on
reconstructing, improving and
standardizing child advocacy pro-
grams nationwide.
Don Duquette, a clinical pro-
fessor of law at the University and
director of the Law School's Child
Advocacy Clinic, will lead the new

Michigan Venture
Center hopes to
encourage startups
By JILLIAN BERMAN
Daily NewsEditor
In hopes of spurring more inno-
vation from faculty and research-
ers, the University is launching
the Michigan Venture Center, a
"one-stop hub for University of

Michigan technology," according
to Jim O'Connell, the associate
director for business formation at
the University's Office of Technol-
ogy Transfer.
The aim of the center isto bring
faculty inventors closer to venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs who
can help them turn their inven-
tions into viable startups.
"The University has a tremen-
dous number of technology oppor-
tunities," O'Connell said. "We
have a chance to license those
out to big companies that are out-
side the state, but when there are

opportunities to create companies
or jobs inside Michigan, we like to
do that."
"We want to make sure those
things don't pass us by," he added.
O'Connell said that though the
center brings together resources
that already exist at the Universi-
ty, the move makes the office more
"high profile." That will encour-
age, he said, faculty inventors to
start businesses who might not
have considered doing so other-
wise.
He added that the center's goal

Instituting a race and ethnicity requirement

All current LSA students
must take one course address-
ing issues of race and diversity
before graduation - but that
wasn't always the case.
The University's diversity
course requirement passed on
Oct. 8, 1990, according to an
article published in The Mich-
igan Daily Oct. 9, 1990.
The article reported that
LSA's Faculty General Assem-
bly voted 139-90 to approve a
mandatory course for under-
graduates "examining the
meaning of race, ethnicity and
racism."
After three years of
debate, the General Assem-
bly welcomed the new course
requirement with "applause
and cheers."
Then-History Prof. Ter-

rence McDonald, who now
serves as dean of the Col-
lege of Literature, Science
and the Arts, co-authored
the proposal and told the
Daily at the time that three
other diversity proposals had
been presented to the faculty,
though only one of them was
seriously considered.
That plan, termed Proposal
A, focused only on "ethnic
and racial intolerance in con-
temporary American society,"
according to the Daily article.
The faculty had voted against
it 99-50 the previous April.
The Daily article quoted
McDonald as saying that his
Faculty Proposal included a
broader range of disciplines
and directly involved faculty
in the development of diver-

sity courses.
While Proposal A focused
only on diversity in the United
States, the Faculty Proposal
looked at those issues in any
society. ThiswayLSAstudents
could satisfy the requirement
by taking courses like Jews
in the Modern World, Dutch
Culture or Introduction to
Anthropology.
Students stood divided over
the new requirement, as the
Daily reported in an Oct. 10,
1990 article.
"It would get people to
confront issues they wouldn't
ordinarily," LSA senior Nicole
Susser told the Daily at the
time.
Chad Reidler, an LSA
freshman, was more critical,
arguing that requiring such

a course eliminated choice.
Reidler also told the Daily that
because of the University's
emphasis on racial and ethnic
diversity on campus, a manda-
tory course was unnecessary.
Although the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly did not take an
official position, its president,
Jennifer Van Valey, expressed
both enthusiasm and skepti-
cism over the proposal in an
interview with the Daily at the
time.
"I will always be in favor of
a diversity requirement," Van
Valey told the Daily.
However, she added the
broad range of classes would
not force students "to look at
the way racism is constructed
in their minds."

* LANSING
Mich. lawmakers:
No gov. shutdown
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm and Republican Senate
Majority Leader Mike Bishop said
yesterday they don't expect anoth-
er government shutdown over the
budget, but they didn't seem close to
agreeing on anything else.
The two met for just over an hour
yesterday afternoon before speak-
ing separately with reporters.
Bishop said he told Granholm he
sees no need for additional tax rev-
enue to enact a yearlong budget for
the state, and warned her against
vetoing items in the budget bills.
"What she's going to do, if she
decides to veto, is to unilaterally
de-fund sections of the budget,"
he said. "They're still pursuing tax
increases that are unnecessary at
" this time. They're bad for Michigan.
And we're going to stand strong."
Granholm told reporters that she
urged the Rochester Republican to
compromise on limited tax and fee
increases she says the state needs to
pay for college scholarships, Medic-
aid, K-12 education and money local
governments use for police and fire
protection.

Dow Jones shows
economy recovering
When the Dow Jones industrial
average first passed 10,000, traders
tossed commemorative caps and
uncorked champagne. This time
around, the feeling was more like
relief.
The best-known barometer of the
stock market entered five-figure ter-
ritory again yesterday, the most vis-
ible sign yet that investors believe
the economy is clawing its way back
from the worst downturn since the
Depression.
The milestone caps a stunning 53
percent comeback for the Dow since
early March, when stocks were at
their lowest levels in more than a
decade.
"It's almostlike an announcement
that the bear market is over," said
Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst
at Jefferies & Co. in Boston. "That
is an eye-opener - 'Hey, you know
what, things must be getting better
because the Dow is over 10,000."'
WASHINGTON
Obamacalls for $250
Soc. Sec. payment
President Barack Obama called on
Congress yesterday to approve $250
payments to more than 50 million
seniors to make up for no increase in
Social Security next year. The Social
Security Administration is sched-
uled to announce today that there
will be no cost of living increase next
year. By law, increases are pegged to
inflation, which has been negative
this year.
It would mark the first year with-
out an increase in Social Security
payments since automatic adjust-
ments were adopted in 1975.
"Even as we seek to bring about
recovery, we must act on behalf of
those hardest hit by this recession,"

Obama said in a statement. "This ad-
ditional assistance will be especially
important in the coming months, as
countless seniors and others have
seen their retirement accounts and
home valuesfdecline as aresultofthis
economic crisis."

85,000 killed in
Iraq, report says
Iraq's government said at least
85,000 Iraqis were killed from 2004
to 2008, officially answering one of
the biggest questions of the conflict -
how many perished in the sectarian
violence that nearly led to a civil war.
What remains unanswered by the
government is how many died in the
2003 U.S. invasionand inthe months
of chaos that followed it.
A report by the Human Rights
Ministry said 85,694 people were
killed from the beginning of 2004
to Oct. 31, 2008 and 147,195 were
wounded. The figures included Iraqi
civilians, military and police but
did not cover U.S. military deaths,
insurgents, or foreigners, including
contractors. And it did not include
the first months of the war after the
2003 U.S.-led invasion.
The Associated Press reported
similar figures in April based on gov-
ernment statistics obtained by the
AP showing that the government
had recorded 87,215 Iraqi deaths
from 2005 to February 2009. The
toll included violence ranging from
catastrophic bombings to execution-
style slayings.

NTSB report says pilot
caused 'U' plane crash

Two years later,
government report
says pilot's record
was "disturbing"
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
pilot of a 2007 medical flight that
crashed into Lake Michigan, kill-
ing all six aboard, mishandled an
unusual flight situation and was
unable to properly coordinate
with his first officer, the National
Transportation Safety Board said
yesterday.
Capt. Bill Serra was flying the
twin-engine Cessna from Milwau-
kee to Michigan. A four-member
medical crew affiliated with the
University of Michigan was on
board, as well as human organs for
transplant.
Besides faulting Serra and first
officer Dennis Hoyes at a hearing,
the NTSB said that a culture of lax
security by flight operator Marlin
Air contributed to the crash. The
board also cited the failure of the
Federal Aviation Administration
to detect and correct deficiencies

of the company.
On a cockpit voice recorder,
Serra can be heard soon after
take off struggling to control the
plane. The NTSB was unable to
determine what caused this, nar-
rowing it to two potential causes:
Hoyes inadvertently turning on
the plane's autopilot, or a problem
with the aircraft's trim control,
which helps maintain the air-
craft's position. A problem with
this control could have caused the
plane to turn sharply, leading to
the crash.
Under either scenario, NTSB
experts said, the crash likely could
have been avoided if the pilots had
maintained a reduced airspeed.
The safetyboard cited the check-
ered history of Serra, and faulted
Marlin Air for not being aware that
in two separate incidents, Serra's
pilot's license was temporarily
revoked. He had been convicted of
using a plane to smuggle drugs into
the United States.
NTSB experts also said their
investigation showed Serra had a
history of cavalier behavior and
rule bending.
Other pilots told NTSB inves-

tigators that Serra had instruct-
ed others to ignore treacherous
weather in some cases and had
once tried to fly even though a strut
had collapsed on his plane.
Reports from other pilots about
Serra "were disturbing," said Mal-
colm Brenner, human performance
group chairman for the NTSB. "At
(Serra's) initial safety meetings he
said something to the effect that
all of us have broken regulations at
some point."
Hoyes had logged many hours
in the air, but seemed inept and
unskilled as a pilot, experts said.
Hoyes made a series of routine
errors that distracted the pilot
and may have contributed to the
crash.
The NTSB also recommended
that Cessna make design modi-
fications to the aircraft involved
- the Citation II - including mov-
ing the location of the button that
switches the plane to autopilot.
The autopilot button and another
motion control button are located
near each other on the center con-
sole, and some aircraft makers
have redesigned consoles to avoid
confusion.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke with business and govern-
ment leaders during her visit to Russia this week.

U.S. urges Russian
officials to stop
"living in the past"
KAZAN, Russia (AP) - U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton on Wednesday challenged
Russians to open up their politi-
cal system, embrace diversity and
scorn Cold War-era thinking.
In Moscow and Kazan, the capi-
tal of Russia's religiously and ethni-
cally diverse republic of Tatarstan,
Clinton underscored to audiences at
elite universities the Obama admin-
istration's desire to "reset" relations
with Russia.
"We have people in our govern-
ment and you have people in your
government who are still living in
the past," she told a crowd of about
2,000 students at Moscow State
University. "They do not believe
the United States and Russia can'
cooperate to this extent."
"They do not trust each other
and we have to prove them

wrong," she said.
Though she seemed to cast blame
equally, Clinton took particular
aim at Russian suspicions toward
improved ties and the influence of
U.S. policies and Western values.
"The more open that Russia can
become, the more Russia will con-
tribute," she said. "The more active
and dynamic the political system
you have, the more ... ideas will go
into the mix and out of it will come
even better answers to the problems
that we all face."
The comments came a day after
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov objected to the Obama
administration's strategy of publicly
threatening Iran with more sanc-

Israel says U.N.
report is one-sided,
biased and wrong
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
Palestinians called yesterday for
global action to punish Israel for
alleged war crimes during its mili-
tary assault on Gaza last winter,
warning that the credibility of the
United Nations and international
human rights law was at stake.
The demand was based on the
findings of a commission headed by
former South African judge Richard
Goldstone that accused both Israeli
forces and Palestinian militants
of war crimes and possible crimes
against humanity during their Dec.
27-Jan.18 war.
Israel immediately rejected the
commission's report, calling it "one-
sided, biased and therefore wrong."
The report became the focus
of the Security Council's monthly
Mideast meeting yesterday after an
about-faceby the Palestinians.
Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riad Al-Malki and Israel's U.N.
Ambassador Gabriela Shalev
opened the council meeting yester-
day by trading accusations about
the Goldstone report. The session
ended yesterday evening after near-
ly50 speeches.
The U.N. Human Rights Council
commissioned the report and took
it up in early October, but Palestin-
ian diplomats agreed to delay con-
sideration until March under heavy
pressure from the United States.
The U.S. feared it would jeopar-
dize attempts to revive the Mideast
peace process.
The call for a delay sparked
scathing criticism of Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas and led
the Palestinians to reverse course,
first seeking an emergency Secu-
rity Councilmeetingand then seek-
ing to reopen the Human Rights
Council debate, which will happen
today.
The Goldstone report concluded
that Israel used disproportionate
force, deliberately targeted civil-
ians, used Palestinians as human
shields, and destroyed civilian
infrastructure during its incursion

into Gaza to root out Palestinian
rocket squads.
It accused Palestinian armed
groups of deliberately targeting
civilians and trying to spread terror
through its rocket attacks on south-
ern Israel. Hamas, the Palestinian
Authority's main rival, controls
Gaza and most armed groups in the
territory.
Al-Malki said "the savage Israeli
military aggression" exhibited "a
callous disregard for human life"
and deliberately destroyed thou-
sands of homes, schools, mosques
and industrial and agricultural
facilities.
He called the report "another
wake-up call to the internation-
al community that must not be
ignored," adding that "the credibil-
ity and foundations of international
human rights and humanitarian
law, as well as of the U.N. as awhole,
is at stake."
Israel's Shalev countered that
the report "favors and legitimizes
terrorism."
She insisted that "it denies Isra-
el's right to defend its citizens. ... It
permitsterrorists to victimize civil-
ians, target the innocent, and use as
human shields those it claims to
defend."
Shalev accused the world of
"doing nothing" about Hamas'
smuggling of Iranian arms into
Gaza, its launching of attacks from
schools, mosques and hospitals, or
its firing if 12,000 rockets against
innocent Israeli civilians.
And she accused Libya - the
only Arab member on the council
- of trying to "hijack" its agenda by
raising the Goldstone report, noting
that three weeks ago Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi called the Secu-
rity Council a "terror council."
The report recommended that
the Security Council require both
sides to carry out credible investi-
gations within three months into
alleged abuses during the conflict
- in which 13 Israelis and almost
1,400 Palestinians, including hun-
dreds of civilians, were killed - and
to follow that up with action in their
courts.
If either side refuses, the investi-
gators recommended that the Secu-
rity Council refer the evidence for

prosecution by the International
Criminal Court, the world's first
permanent war crimes tribunal,
within six months.
France's U.N. Ambassador
Gerard Araud called the allega-
tions in the report "grave indeed"
and urged both parties to conduct
independent investigations that
meet international standards. Brit-
ain's U.N. Ambassador John Sawers
expressed regret that Israel refused
to cooperate with the commission
and urged the Israeli government
"to carry out full, credible and
impartial investigations."
The draft resolution to be con-
sidered at this week's Human
Rights Council meeting in Geneva
would condemn Israel's failure to
cooperate with Goldstone's fact-
finding mission and endorse the
report's recommendations. The
draft calls on the U.N. and other
bodies to ensure implementation
of the recommendations, calls on
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
to submit a report to the council on
the status of implementation, and
asks the General Assembly to take
up the Goldstone report in the cur-
rent session.
The Human Rights Council is
expected to vote on the resolution
tomorrow, and approval will likely
return the issue to the Security
Council.
But council diplomats say there
is little chance that the Security
Council will take any action, pri-
marily because of objections by
the United States, Israel's closest
ally, which said the report should
be handled by the Human Rights
Council.
U.S. deputy ambassador Ale-
jandro Wolff reiterated yesterday
that the report and "the allegations
of human rights and humanitarian
law violations ... are not a matter for
Security Council action."
Healsocriticizedwhathetermed
"its unbalanced focus on Israel."
Wolff said Israel has the institu-
tions to seriously investigate the
allegations "and we encourage it to
do so." On the other hand, he added:
"Hamas is a terrorist organization
and has neither the ability nor the
willingness to examine its viola-
tions of human rights."

University must pursue open legal strategy in lawsuit
ne would expect a university that prides itself on its
accepting and friendly community would make it a pri-
ority to enforce its own non-discrimination policy. But
when a gay law professor filed suit against the University alleging
that he had been discriminated against, the University took the
position that it wasn't obligated to uphold its policy - a position
it only changed after an outcry from faculty. After more than five
years of the University's attempts to dismiss the lawsuit, a hearing
was finally conducted Friday. But regardless of how this case is
decided, the University must formulate its legal arguments more
sensitively - and more openly - in the future.

ast month, one of my sorority
sisters was getting married. For
the first time in my life, I was
stumped aboutwhat
to buy as a wed-
ding gift. I knew
my sister's sizes for
shoes and lingerie,
book preferences,
favorite foods and
biographic details
- the whole nine
yards. But now that ROSE
I wasn't just buying
for her, the whole AFRIYIE
twosome bit was-
throwing me for a
loop.
House appliances were overdone.
Money and gift cards weren't personal
enough. So, I did what any sorority girl
would do when faced with this situ-
ation: I headed to the nearest sex toy
store.
It's a beautiful thing to attend a
university where safe, affordable sex
toys are sold right off campus. One of
Ann Arbor's best-kept secrets is that
the Safe Sex Store (S3) on South Uni-
versity is a hub for sorority girls who
sometimes travel in pairs to buy their
big, little, dean, pledge, sands, soror
or sister tokens of affection to get her
vibe on. The thing is, I wasn't the run-
of-the mill customer. I had spent my
past summer doing evidence-based
research and one of thetopics I covered
was sex toys and lubricant.
Because of this research, I knew
that according to a 2009 study in the
Juurnal of Sexual Medicine, a majority
of women - 53 percent - had used a
vibrator. Additionally, I knew that men
were also getting in on it - 91 percent
of men and 81 percent of women who
used a vibrator used it with a part-
ner. And this couldn't help but bring a
smile to my face as I walked pastpenis-
shaped baking tins and breast-shaped
kegs. Accordingto the study, those who

used sex toys had higher rates of sexual
pleasure and better sexual health than
non-users.Womenwhousedtoysfound
it easier to naturally lubricate and men
had higher erectile functioning.
As I eyed the goods, I was immedi-
ately impressed: All toys were phtha-
late-free. While research on phthalates
is still ongoing, researchers have linked
these plastic-softening chemicals to
negative health outcomes. S3 offered
affordable silicone vibrators and dildos,
ranging in price from $20 to $140. The
deal with silicone, and glass for that
matter, is that it is one of the few toy
material types that can be thoroughly
cleaned. Other materials such as jelly
rubber, polyvinyl chlorides, elastomer
- and anything else that smells like a
shower curtain -is porous. Thismeans
itretainsbacteria, no matterhow much
antibacterial soap you use to clean it.
That's not to say all rubber toys should
be hurled to the nearest landfill. Itjust
means that porous toys should be used
with a condom to ensure one doesn't
get an infection.
The collection of male sex toys had
also grown since my last visit. From
disposable masturbator toys, male
masturbation sleeves and vibrating
cock rings priced $5 to $30, men have
some great options for self-love or a
pleasurable exchange.
But because I believe that sex is a
holistic act, I wasn'tjustgoingtofill my
shopping cart with a vibrator and cock
ring and call it a day. I was interested
in the adult sex education books. Itwas
nice to see books donning pictures of
African-American couples that taught
erotic massage and Kama Sutra posi-
tions that weren't just for contortion-
ists. I offered a silent prayer of thanks
for all the authors that dedicated gal-
lons of ink to how-to books for going
down on a woman.
After that, I was on my way to the
lube counter. Lube is a safe sex essen-
tial. Many will attestto the miraculous

powers of saliva, but it only lasts so
long. I scanned labels to secure some
glycerin and paraben free lube. While
studies are still inconclusive, parabens
have been linked to cancer. Glycerin, on
the other hand, creates an environment
in the vadge that is friendly to yeast
infections. I didn't want my friend to
have any unwanted guests during their
honeymoon period, so I was thrilled to
seelubethatmet all the healthrequire-
ments and still lefta film on my finger-
tips an hour later. With healthy lube,
toys for him and her and books galore,
my mission was accomplished.
A few weeks later, I went back to
thank the storeowner of S3, University
alum and educator Beth Karmeisool,
and to get some insights for this col-
umn. I asked her what toys students
come in for the most, and how one
knows when a toy is right.
Students have
good options for
pleasing partners.
"I sell a lot of Jack Rabbits and cock
rings, but it's not about what other
people buy," she said. "I keep products
that are fresh and hot based on design,
material and customer feedback. It's
all about meeting people at their com-
fort level."
I glanced around the room at my
peers. Sorority women held fetish fan-
tasy kits and condoms. Average Joes
clung to their lube proudly. Couples
searched through condoms branded
with the word "ecstasy." And I thought
to myself, this is what sexual literacy
looks like.

Peter Hammer, who is now a law professor
at Wayne State University, sued the Univer-
sity after being denied tenure at the Univer-
sity's Law School in 2003. The University
review board initially approved Hammer's
tenure in a 4-1 vote. But the Law School
tenured faculty only voted 18-12 in favor of
approving tenure, two votes less than the
necessary two-thirds majority. Because of
that Hammer was denied tenure. He claims
he was the first male law school professor
to be denied tenure in more than 40 years
and that the decision was made that way
because he is gay. Hammer is now waiting
for the court to determine if this case will go
to trial.
The manner in which the University first
handled this issue was extremely troubling.
In 2006, the University argued for the case
to be thrown outonthe basis that the Univer-
sity has no legal responsibility to uphold the
non-discrimination policies outlined in its
employee handbook. The University's gen-
eral counsel specified that the non-discrim-
ination guidelines are only a "commitment,"
that don't necessarily have legal value.
The strategy, which was supposed to be
private, was obviously absurd. And faculty
and students called the University out for it.
As a result, the University switched its strat-
SEN
"Right to defend itself" is
too vague a claim for Israel

egy and instead argued that discrimination
didn't occur. Absorbing this criticism and
changing its strategy was the right move for
the University.
But students and faculty need some assur-
ance that other legal decisions being made
by the University are consistent with this
university's values. Such decisions should
not be kept private, and should never violate
the University's commitment to uphold a
policy of acceptance for all kinds of people.
After all, the University should feel morally
compelled to uphold its non-discrimination
policy regardless of whether it's legally
binding. Moving forward, the University
must rest its legal strategies on a sound com-
mitment to non-discrimination instead of
simply reverting to such a position to cover
its back. And if legal strategies were not for-
mulated behind closed doors, people would
be able to put more faith in the University's
position.
It's very unclear whether anti-gay preju-
dice played a role in Hammer's denial of
tenure. If it did, the University has a respon-
sibility to do something about it. But in either
case, the University's position should always
be open to the campus population and should
consistently support policies of non-discrim-
ination, whether the law says it has to or not.

Fifth-year senior David Moosman has filled in at center for the last three games while regular starter David Molk rehabs a broken foot.

ZACHARY MEISNER/Daily

With Molk out, Moosman
adds own touch to center

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan Stadium field
turf poses a bit of a problem for
fifth-year senior David Moos-
man.
How does he remove the rub-
ber artificial pellets that get stuck
in his grizzly thick, strawberry
blond beard?
"My girlfriend's always pick-
ing it out," Moosman said with a
laugh. "She makes sure I know.
Good shower helps, too."
Considering Moosman's con-
tact on the offensive line, it's
inevitable the 6-foot-5, 293-pound
lineman would be very famiJiar
with the ground. After receiv-
ing his first varsity letter just last
year, Moosman has stepped into a
very versatile role for the Wolver-
ines this season.
In 2008, Moosman started all
12 games at right guard. As a sta-
ble force on an offensive line that
spent the better part of Michi-
gan's 3-9 season in flux, Moos-
man and his teammates tried to
adapt to Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez's system.
Within that system, a year
made a wealth of difference. The
offensive line, one of the Wolver-
ines' biggest liabilities last sea-

son, was supposed to be one of
their biggest strengths coming
into this year.
"It's actually a huge differ-
ence," center David Molk said
during fall camp. "We all know
each other, all know where each
other's feet are going to be. Pass
protection is a lot different, pass-
ing off, zone blocks, belly blocks
... it's completely different."
But halfway through the sea-
son, shuffling has replaced sta-
bility as the offensive line has
endured multiple injuries. And
Moosman has been at the fore-
front.
After starting at right guard in
.the Wolverines' rst two games,
Moosman injured his left shoul-
der against Notre Dame in Michi-
gan's come-from-behind win.
The next week, the line was
forced to respond against Eastern
Michigan withouthim. But things
would get even worse against the
Eagles, when Molk went down
with a broken foot. Because he
didn't know the extent of his
injury at the time, Molk stayed on
the field.
"It takes a different type of
person, and Molk is that type of
person," Moosman said. "You
need to not be able to think about
it, you just got to keep going and

not stop. And, he's that kind of
guy. He's a real tough kid, a real
tough guy. He just kind of puts it
out of his mind.
"It's a tough thing to put out of
your mind. You're kind of walk-
ing on it."
Molk's injury wasn't the best
news for a rehabbing Moosman.
Still nursing his battered left
shoulder, Moosman was tapped
to start at center in the Wolver-
ines' next game against Indiana.
Having played seven games at the
position earlier in his career and
taking reps during practice, the
move seemed logical.
But Moosman's first start as
center was more complicated.
Michigan endured six botched
snaps against Indiana, includ-
ing two that resulted in 20- and
22-yard losses.
With ice cushioning his still
ailing shoulder, Moosman didn't
shy away from his faults, saying
after the game, "Put the blame on
me."
Moosman said the biggest
challenge he has faced at center
is ability to snap the ball with one
hand. For the split second that he
snaps the ball with his right arm,
he has just his left arm available
to block. With his shoulder at less
than 100 percent, the process has

been trying.
"I was kind of hoping that Molk
would not get hurt, so I could get
another week of rehab in, but as
it was, I got in there," Moosman
said this week. "Like I said, you
don't want to think about it. Gut
through it. Played well, needed to
play better. Now it's fine."
With three games now at cen-
ter, Moosman is more acclimated
with the snaps and the mistakes
are less obvious.
Moosman said Monday that
he doesn't know where his natu-
ral position on the line is, and
he anticipates that when Molk
returns in a couple weeks, the
shift back to right guard may take
some time.
At center, Moosman has taken
up a leadership position on the
line, making calls, connecting
with the quarterback and com-
ing through with quality snaps.
Unlike Molk, who is very outgo-
ing, Moosman said his leadership
style could be described as more
laid-back.
"If you ask the other guys, I'm
sure they'll say mine's a little bit
less regimented," Moosman said.
"I feel like I'm a little bit more
relaxed than Molk sometimes. He
gets really fired up, and I'm more
of a calm guy."

Wright and Gibson
point to Lee and
Merritt as good
examples
By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Writer
At Michigan Media Day on Tues-
day, most of the questions about the
basketball team's leadership per-
tained to junior Manny Harris and
senior Deshawn Sims, last year's
leading scorers.
What went largely unnoticed is
the fact that you don't need to score
a lot of points to be a team leader.
"Everybody who was here last
year needs to be more of a leader,"
redshirt junior Anthony Wright
said. "Just being able to tell the
younger players what to do because
they have respect for us. We've
been there, finally, and done that,
finally."
While having a team's leading
scorers step up is always a good
thing, last year's team proved that
formula isn't the only route to suc-
cess.
C.J. Lee, a walk-on point guard
who graduated last year, averaged
under three points per game but
was widely considered to be the
most vocal leader on the team.
"C.J. emerged as a starter and
was always great with team chem-
istry," coach John Beilein said.
Fellow point guard and graduate
David Merritt averaged under two
points per game but also brought

many valuable qualities off the
court.
Really, the only requirement for
last year's leaders was experience.
"One of the things I want to do,
being in my last year and being
a senior, is be more of a leader,"
fifth-year senior Zack Gibson said.
"Helping the freshmen get involved
and making sure they can help us."
While Beilein encourages every-
one to be a leader, he would clearly
welcome Sims and Harris filling
the leadership role while they fill
out the stat sheet.
"Both of them need to assume
ownership of the team," Beilein
said. "When you do that, that's usu-
ally a pretty major step. They need
to do that. But until they're cast
into that, like they are right now,
you don't know how they're going
to- respond."
Wright averaged just under three
points per game last year, Gibson
just under four. Wright said being
a leader is not just about what you
say, but about what you do.
"In practice, it's about doing
every drill thinking, 'This might
help us win a game down the
road,'" he said.
When asked if he felt any added
responsibility to be a leader this
year, Wright was adamant.
"Always," he said. "Getting up
for workouts, calling team meet-
ings, it's just the small things."
If Wright and Gibson can step
up in a leadership role this year and
take some of the pressure off Harris
and Sims, those small things could
prove to be game-changing.

Business yesterday about the opportunities for investment.
Hong Kong off l talks

Tong says economic
freedom of Hong
Kong makes it an
investor's paradise
By ALEX KIRSHENBAUM
For the Daily
With its low tax rates and eco-
nomic freedom, Hong Kong is an
idealdestination forinvestment, an
official from the budding city said
in an address on campus yesterday.
Donald Tong, the Hong Kong
Commissioner for Economic and
Trade Affairs in the United States,
spoke before about 70 people at the
Ross School of Business yesterday
afternoon.
In his presentation, Tong dis-
cussed Hong Kong's present eco-
nomic state, as well as the city's
future prospects and its potential
relationship with Michigan and
the United States.
HongKongstands out as aglobal
city largely because of how inviting
the economy is, ranked the freest
in the world, Tong said.
"You should keep most of what
you earn," Tong said.
"Trade is our bread and butter,"
he said. "We pay no taxes to foreign
authorities. Our tax rate is simple
and low."

Tong said Hong Kong's warmth
to foreign investors, embraced by
the United States as a whole, has
historically notextended as fully to
Michigan. He said he believes that
this is changing, though.
"If you look at the trade volume,
it's not on the very high side," he
said. "Butthemore importantthing
is that you look at the growth."
Over the past few years, trade
between Michigan and Hong
Kong has been steadily increas-
ing, according to Tong. This figure
should increase even more in the
near future, Tong said, especially
with the American auto industry's
new focus ongoinggreen.
"Hong Kong and China, and
indeed most of the global players,
have attached great importance to
reduction of greenhouse gasses,"
Tong said. "Electric vehicles would
be one way to shift that."
Tong pointed out, however,
that Hong Kong's hilly geography
makes current electric car models
difficult to sell there.
Though electric cars with
roughly a 100-kilometer range are
useful for travel within a most cit-
ies, Tong said that with the heavy
automobile traffic between Hong
Kong and mainland China, cars
with longer battery ranges are
needed.
"Hopefully, somewhere down
the road, there will be further

innovation in terms of technology,"
Tong said. "Then we would be able
to look at the same issue again."
When asked why he chose the
University of Michigan as his
forum to speak, Tong said it was
because the University is a good
school.
"It has a very good reputation,
especially the Ross School of Busi-
ness," Tongsaid. "It's agood oppor-
tunity to reach out to graduates
and undergraduates while they're
still in college.
Tong expressed his desire to
attract students to Hong Kong,
hoping that by coming to the Uni-
versity, he would help "put Hong
Kong on (students') radar screens."
Some members of the audience,
most of whom were graduate stu-
dents from the Ross School of Busi-
ness or the Ford School of Public
Policy, thought Tong had good
things to say.
MBA student Ramana Atluri
said he thought the presentation
was fantastic.
"It was a wonderful window
into Hong Kong's economy," Atluri
said.
Public Policy graduate student
Simon Tam agreed.
"I'm originally from Hong
Kong," Tam said. "Being there
you're sort of desensitized with the
competitive advantage Hong Kong
has."

WASSERSTEIN

careful reporter with an eye for
personal details and was, I think,
very good at strategizing, scoping
things out, and again, of course
that's where he made his living,"
Killingsworth said in a phone con-
versation yesterday evening.
Many on campus were angry
after the University turned over a
list of names to Congress, accord-
ing to Killingsworth, who is now a
professor of economics at Rutgers
University.
Wasserstein responded to the
University's decision by extensively
interviewing members of the Uni-
versity's Law School community to
find out where University officials
stood on the event and whether
they had tried to prevent it, Killing-
sworth said.
"It's eerie reading (Wasserstein's
article) and then knowing he went
on to become, first of all, a great
lawyer and secondly, a great deal-
maker," Killingsworth said. "All
of the themes of that, I think, are
clearly visible in what he did."
Though Wasserstein was recog-
nized by all who knew him for his
remarkable smarts, he was also
keenly identified by his Daily co-
workers by his disheveled appear-
ance, according to Daniel Okrent,
another Daily alumnus who now
writes for Time Magazine as well
as other publications.
"The key things about Bruce was
he was incredibly smart (and) he
was a total slob in college," Okrent
said. "He meant to tuck in his shirt
but he never managed to really pull
it off. He was pudgy, he was amus-
ing and he always seemed to be
thinking a few steps ahead of the
rest of us."
Those messy tendencies proved
to be more endearing than detri-
mental.
Wasserstein graduated from the
University in 1967 at the age of 19
with an Honors degree in political
science. He later went on to gradu-
ate from both Harvard Law School
and Harvard Business School, and
later studied at Cambridge Univer-
sity as a Knox Traveling Fellow.
"I guess (his appearance) didn't
do that much against him," said
Andy Sacks, who was a Daily Photo
Editor. "You and me were prob-
ably taught that we had to tuck our

Success Program were polled to

tive grade point average for the
football team would be, on aver-
age.
"He was given an estimate," she
said. She added that a number of
players had lately achieved their
"personal best" academically.
According to the Free Press
report, Rodriguez also made a
similar statement before a group
of University alumni in Washing-
ton, D.C. in May.
"We have a couple, two or three
of our student-athletes, who have
not gotten their grades back. I
think the professors maybe left
early, but when we get those back,

is to increase the average number
of startups in the next five years
from nine to 12 a year.
"The first step is to create the
thought that this mightbe a startup
as opposed to just another technol-
ogy, and I guess hopefully get them
excited about the opportunity,"
O'Connell said. "It's not like we
have a new set of offices or a new
building, it's just a way of focusing
and gatheringtogether the resourc-
es that were there already."
Ken Nisbet, executive director
of the Office of Technology Trans-
fer, said though the University has
been relatively successful at turn-
ing inventions into startups, the
goal of the center is to increase
the "quality and quantity" of those
startups.
"We've averaged about nine
startups a year which is actually
equivalent to a school like Stan-
ford," he said. "We've done well,
but we knew given the economy,
knowing the opportunities that
exist within the University we
wanted to improve."
While other colleges like the

sentation is very rare."

shirts in to get ahead in the world.
Bruce got ahead without paying
much attention to that detail."
Killingsworth said Wasserstein
- a born deal-maker - was also
instrumental in handling a situa-
tion during the winter of 1967 in
which the Board in Control of Stu-
dent Publications rejected Roger
Rapoport, the editorial staff's nom-
inee for editor in chief. At the time,
top editors needed the approval of
the Board - a process that is no lon-
ger in place.
The paper's top editors decided
that despite their ongoing efforts to
resolve the confrontation with the
Board, they had a responsibility to
report on the proceedings.
"Bruce's attitude about the
whole thing was that we were first
and foremost reporting this," Kill-
ingsworth said. "And sure we had
to make decisions about how we
were going to wage war against the
Board. Bruce was, I'd say, one of
the key strategizers in figuring out
what to do and sticking to it."
Killingsworth said it was during
this time that Wasserstein's com-
mitment to journalistic integrity
was truly proven.
"The remarkable thing about it,
I think, was he never, ever, even
for a moment, suspected or consid-
ered the possibilities that we might
somehow withhold something that
we knew for fear that it would clear
a deal with the Board," Killings-
worth said. "His attitude was,'We'll
press ahead with what we want,hbut
in the meantime we've got to report
the news."'
"I have an enormous amount
of respect for what he did at the
Daily," Killingsworth added.
Respect for Wasserstein carried
on long after his time at the Uni-
versity ended - especially because
of Wasserstein's attachment to his
college workplace.
For example, one day during the
summer of 1984, Wasserstein came
back to Ann Arbor and stopped
off at 420 Maynard St. to visit the
Daily's summer staff, according to
Neil Chase, who was working as
the Daily's summer editor-in-chief
at the time.
Wasserstein treated the Daily
staffers to lunch at Cottage inn
on East Liberty Street, inquired
about their doings at the Daily and
spoke of his time there. Meanwhile,
because of Wasserstein's humble
nature, they had no idea they were
we think we'll break the record
- 25-year record - for overall
football team GPA this semester,"
Rodriguez is quoted as saying in
the Free Press story.
In Rodriguez's statement yes-
terday, he said the Academic Suc-
cess Program officials "did not
make it clear that the number was
just an estimate and not an exact
calculation."
"We apologize ifthis has caused
any confusion," he added.
In the interview, Michels
admitted that there never were
and still aren't any real numbers
to support the claim.
"It was not based on any spe-
cific data," she said.
Atthetime,Rodriguez "thought
it was an actual number," accord-
ing to University spokeswoman
Kelly Cunningham.
have venture centers, Nisbet said
the University of Michigan hopes
to bring the concept to a new level.

"Several universities have-
dedicated units that work on new
startups," he said. "The venture
center concept of an integrated set
of resources is not totally unique.
We're not unique in what we're
doing, but we're going to be world-
class in how we execute the con-
cept."
Nisbet said there are currently
about 60 or 70 inventions in the
pipeline that could be eligible to be
licensed to companies.
"Most of our new discoveries
would end up being licensed to an
existing company," he said. "Some
of these ideas could form a basis of
a company. In the end we analyze it
to ensure that the idea makes sense
for a new business startup."
O'Connell said if the project has
"enough legs" to become a startup,
they will put it on a path toward
becoming its own business, instead
of being licensed to another com-
pany.
Thewhole process - from inven-
tion to startup - usually takes
about one and a half to two years.
The center will provide inven-
tors with resources throughout
the process, like access to venture

hanging out with one of the most
prominent names on Wall Street,
Chase said.
"It wasn't until after he left, we
did a little research on our own and
figured out what a powerful guy in
the investment business he was,"
Chase said. "He was already really
successful by then."
Though primarily a finance
guru, Wasserstein did contribute
substantially to the world of jour-
nalism, Chase said.
Wasserstein went on to found
The Deal, a financial newsweek-
ly, and also bought and reshaped
other publications like American
Lawyer and New York magazine.
Before his death, Wasserstein
was also rumored to be among
the potential bidders to purchase
BusinessWeek.
He also co-founded Wasserstein
Perella, an investment banking
firm where he served as CEO from
1988 to 2001. Following his success
there, Lazard hired Wasserstein in
2002. In his first year on the job,
Wasserstein boldly took the com-
pany public after more than a cen-
tury of private ownership.
Besides his undeniable mark on
the investment banking, Wasser-
stein left a definite mark on Univer-
sity of Michigan students' lives. He
established the Morris Wasserstein
Award through the LSA Honors
Program, in honor of his father,
which provides honors students
on the Daily's writing and editorial
staffs with scholarship money that
"can exceed $1000/term for one or
two terms," according to the Uni-
versity of Michigan Honors Pro-
gram website.
Though Okrent claims Wasser-
stein was "smarter than the rest of
us combined," he never could have
guessed he would become such
an immense leader in the finance
world.
"When he went off to get his
juris law degree at Harvard, you
knew that if Bruce ever got his act
together, which he did, he would
be very successful, but there was
no clue he would pursue a career in
high finance," he said.
Killingsworth, too, said he didn't
foresee Wasserstein's trancedence
from Daily editor to Wall Street
power broker, but he did know
Wasserstein had the skills to be
very successful.
"He was a phenomenon," Killing-
sworth said. "He was amazing."
Michels said that the cumula-
tive GPA for the team is neither
compiled for University purposes
nor for NCAA eligibility purpos-
es.
"Nobody uses that informa-
tion," she said.
Michels said, "there's just no
good academic reason" to compile
the information.
She said that in the past Uni-
versity officials have compiled
the team's cumulative grade point
average in rare instances.
In the fall of 2008, Rodriguez
asked for a cumulative GPA for
the team. That information was
compiled, Michels said. But the
information was later destroyed
and not retained.
"The Academic Success Pro-
gram doesn't use that for any-
thing," Michels said.

capitalists - the center has about
200 in its "Rolodex," according
to O'Connell - and mentors in
residence, who are local business
owners and entrepreneurs with
experience with startups.
David Hartmann, who has start-
ed three companies of his own, is
a mentor in residence. He said his
role is to aid faculty inventors by
tracking down interested alumni,
helping them in the grant-writing
process and providing them with
other resources that will help them
start their companies get off the
ground.
Hartmann said he decided to
become a mentor in residence
because he wanted to find a way
to "give back to the community"
after he gothis third startup off the
ground.
"I think the Michigan economy
really needs a transformation," he
said. "It's going though a very dif-
ficult time and certainly with the
one billion (dollars) inresearchthat
we've earned and spent last year
with the University, there's got to
be more commercial possibilities
coming out of that."
"For me," he added, "it's about
finding the next bright idea that
can replace the Pfizers of the com-
munity."

Gunmen attack three law
enforcement facilities in
eastern Pakistan city,

Federal Investigation
Agency says
attacks will be
closely examined
LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -
Teams of gunmen attacked three
law enforcement facilities in Pak-
istan's eastern city of Lahore on
Thursday, a major escalation in an
audacious wave of terror strikes
as this U.S.-allied, nuclear-armed
country prepares for an offensive
in a Taliban and al-Qaida strong-
hold.
At least seven people died in a
gunfight with police at one site,
police said as the city plunged
into chaos.
In the Taliban-riddled north-
west, meanwhile, a suicide car
bomber detonated his vehicle
next to a police station, killing
at least eight people, while a sus-
pected U.S. missile strike killed
four alleged militants, officials
said.
"The enemy has started a guer-
rilla war," Pakistan's Interior
Minister Rehman Malik told a
local television station.
One attack in Lahore occurred
at a building housing the Fed-
eral Investigation Agency, a law
enforcement organization that
deals with matters ranging from
immigration to terrorism. Local
media channels reported that
hostages were being held.
"We are under attack," said
Mohammad Riaz, an FIA employ-
ee reached inside the building via
phone by The Associated Press
during the assault. "I can see two
people hit, but I do not know who
they are."
Senior government official Saj-
jad Bhutta said the attack lasted
about 11/2 hours and was over by

11 a.m. He said the dead included
two attackers, four government
employees and a bystander. Senior
police official Chaudhry Shafiq
said one of the dead wore a jacket
bearing explosives.
Two other groups of attackers
struck police facilities in the area
Lahore's outskirts in violence that
was continuing, Shafiq said.
One occurred at the Manawan
police training school - the sec-
ond time attackers have struck
there this year. The earlier attack
led to an eight-hour standoff with
the army that left 12 people dead.
No casualty figures were immedi-
ately available for the Thursday
strike.
Another was at anelite police
commando training center not far
from the airport. Senior police
official Malik Iqbal said at least
one police constable was killed
there.
Television footage showed
helicopters in the air over one of
the police facilities and paramili-
tary forces with rifles and bullet-
proof vests taking cover behind
trees outside a wall surrounding
the compound.
The militants have claimed
credit for a series of attacks in
recent days, including a siege of
the army's headquarters in the
garrison city of Rawalpindi that
left 23 people dead.
The Taliban have warned Paki-
stan to stop pursuing them in mil-
itary operations.
The Pakistani army has given
no time frame for the expected
offensive in South Waziristan
tribal region, but has reportedly
already sent two divisions total-
ing 28,000 men and blockaded
the area.
Fearing the looming offensive,
about 200,000 people have fled
South Waziristan since August,
moving in with relatives or rent-

ing homes in the Tank and Dera
Ismail Khan areas, a local gov-
ernment official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity because
he was not authorized to talk to
the media.
The Thursday morning suicide
attack occurred in the Saddar
area of Kohat, a district near the
tribal areas.
Police official Afzal Khan said
at least 20 people were wounded,
and that both police and civilians
were among the eight killed. Half
the police building was brought
down.
"We fear that some policemen
are trapped under the rubble," he
said.
The U.S. has encouraged Paki-
stan to take strong action against
insurgents who are using its soil
as a base for attacks in Afghani-
stan, where U.S. troops are
bogged down in an increasingly
difficult war.
The Americans have carried
out a slew of their own own mis-
sile strikes in South and North
Waziristan over the past year,
killing several top militants
including Pakistani Taliban chief
Baitullah Mehsud.
The early Thursday missile
strike hit a compound in Dande
Derpa Khel, an area in North
Waziristan where members of
the militant network led by Jala-
luddin Haqqani are believed to
operate.
The two intelligence officials
who gave word of the strike said
the exact identities of the four
killed were unclear. The officials
spoke on condition of anonymity
because they were not authorized
to speak to media on the record.
Pakistani formally protests the
missile strikes as violations of its
sovereignty, but many analysts
believe it has a secret deal with
the U.S. allowing them.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Berenson preaches offensive toughness.

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
After playing 987 games as a
defenseman protecting NHL creas-
es, Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson knows the price forwards
need to pay to be successful in front
of the net.
Two games into the season,
Berenson hasn't seen any of his for-
wards consistently offer up their
bodies in front
of the pipes. But NOTEBOOK
when his play-
ers do swarm the net, the effort is
rewarded. After failing to score a
goal in its previous game, Michigan
found more success swarming the
net in its 6-1 win against Alaska-
Anchorage Saturday.
"On Friday night, we were get-
ting good shots from the point,"
Berenson said. "But the goalie saw
all the shots. We never got any-
body in front. Our forwards weren't
determined enough to get to the
front of the net. Saturday, we were,
and that was the difference."
While the physical role currently
remainsvacant,there's a212-pound
glimmer of hope in senior Brian
Lebler. He scored his first goal of
the season on a deflection early in
the game and has been one player to
go to the net occasionally.

"Lebler should be (the guy in
front)," Berenson said. "He's a
senior, he's a big body, and he's a
big strong kid. He's played that role
from time to time, but we're still not
as consistently good at it. I could
never puta (Detroit Red Wings for-
ward Tomas) 'Holmstrom' stamp
on anybody on this team until they
can do it night after night."
YOUNG GUNS COOL DOWN:
Freshman forward Chris Brown
led all freshman in points on the
weekend with two goals and an
assist. His three points were tied
with junior Matt Rust for the most
on the team. None of the other six
freshman have recorded a point
yet.
"You can't expect your fresh-
man to carry your team," Berenson
said. "But they still need to know
the level of play, the level of com-
mitment and competition to play at
Michigan, and I think they learned
that this weekend."
With six freshmen on offense
and just one on defense, the expe-
rienced blue liners have provided
support not just with producing
offense, but helping the players
along.
"We have brought in a lot of
freshmen forwards and they're
learning real quick," juniordefense-
man Tristin Llewellyn said. "Hav-

ing this veteran group (on defense)
helps really speed up the process."
With experienced teammates
and this weekend off, the for-
wards should be able to get up
to speed in time for their home
opener next Thursday. Whatever
the learning curve may be, Beren-
son doesn't seemed concerned
with his freshmen at this point in
the season.
"The team, really, is as good as
its upperclassmen," Berenson said.
"Freshmen and sophomores need
to be making us better and hopeful-
ly making a little bit of a difference
in different roles."
NOTES: Unlike last season,
whenthe Wolverines were plagued
with injuries early in the season,
the team remains in good health.
Senior forward Anthony Ciraulo
sat out practice with a sore back
yesterday, and junior defenseman
Chad Langlais sat out Monday's
practice with a sore groin, but both
are expected to be 100 percent for
the next game. ... The Wolverines
play in their home opener October
22 against Niagara before flying
east to take on Boston Univer-
sity the following Saturday. They
played the same Thursday/Satur-
day schedule last year, beating the
Purple Eagles 4-2 before losing to
BU 7-2.

SAID ALSALAH/Daily
Senior Brian Lebler may become the Wolverines' most physical forward, in part because of his 212-pound frame.

Wolverines, Quihano dance around Bearcats in shutout

By JAKE FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Earlier this week,junior defend-
er Jeff Quihano brought a sombre-
ro to practice and choreographed a
"Mexican Hat Dance."
As a defender who takes very
few shots, Quihano wanted a spe-
cial way CGN
to cel-M
ebrate his CINCINNATI 0
next goal
and intended to reveal the "Hat
Dance" whenever the opportu-
nity presented itself. Little did
he know that he would need his
hat in his next game - during
Wednesday's 2-0 victory at Cin-
cinnati.

In the game's 20th minute, the
Wolverines already led 1-0. Quih-
ano found freshman midfielder
Hamoody Saad on the flank and
vacated his left-back position to
streak up the field.
Saad chipped the ball over
Bearcat defenders back to Quih-
ano, who faced a near-impossi-
ble angle on the baseline. The
defender blasted a shot over the
keeper into the roof of the goal.
Without his sombrero, he needed
to improvise.
"After I scored, one of my
teammates, (senior defenseman)
Julian Robles, told me, 'Go ahead
and do the 'Stanky Leg,' " Quih-
ano said. "So I put my finger on
my nose, made it seem like it was

a smelly scene, and just did the session.

Chris Blais continued his solid
play by posting six saves in the
winning effort and earning his
fifth shutout of the season.
"Our overall management of
the game was superb - the best
of the season to date," Michi-
gan coach Steve Burns said.
"Our team showed their class in
the first 20 minutes and really
opened up Cincinnati through
some great possession and play
in the flanks.
"The two goals we scored in
that time were deserved, and
we weren't far off delivering the
knockout punch with a third
goal.
"To Cincinnati's credit, they
were up for the challenge and we

showed a lot of poise in weather-
ing their direct play the rest of the
way."
In securing the victory against
the physical Bearcats, Michigan
proved that it can win by employ-
ing many different styles of play.
Such versatility will be needed
as Michigan prepares for its final
stretch of the season against
Akron, Michigan State, North-
western, and Ohio State.
These games will be much
easier if the Wolverines continue
to receive scoring contributions
from unlikely players like Quih-
ano.

SAVING OLD
*SOUNDS.
A HOME ON CAMPUS FOR
FORGOTTEN INSTRUMENTS
BY LEAH BURGIN |I DAILY ARTS WRITER

I ELEVISIUN
Before there was
"SNL," the world had
Monty Python. Though
the Pythons have
been largely inactive
since "Monty Python's
The Meaning of Life"
was released in 1983,
IFC is airing a mini-
series documenting
the comedy troupe's
rise to greatness
and graceful fall into
cult fandom. "Monty
Python: Almost the
Truth (The Lawyer's
Cut)" premieres
Sunday at 9 p.m.
ON DISPLAY
Grey skies, barren
fields, solemn figures
- not the ingredi-
ents for cheery art.
Still, photographers
Robert and Shana
ParkeHarrison prove
there can be beauty in
bleakness. Their sur-
real, monochromatic
portraits explore the
isolation of humans
in a world dominated
by technology, chaos
and suffering. Their
work is on display in
the Slusser Gallery on
North Campus from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. tomor-
row. The event is free.

Among the roughly 2,500 instruments preserved in the Stearns Collections are a Javanese gamelan,
the first mass-produced Moog synthesizer, the theremin used for the radio show "The Green Hornet"
and a collection ofttrumpets donated by a former trumpeter of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

FILM
"Under Our Skin," a
documentary about
the untold effects of
Lyme disease, plays
tonight at 6:45 p.m. at
the Michigan Theater.
The movie exposes
how America's health
care system has fre-
quently misdiagnosed
the disease, which
affects three million
people nationwide.
The condition can
become debilitating
if left unchecked.

There are always
new things to
discover about
the instruments,
and they start
to tell very long,
complex stories.
- STEVEN BALL
DIRECTOR OF THE STEARNS COLLECTION

tifully hand-
varytng tn
shape and
size, stretches
out across
the room. The metallic bars of
several xylophone-like instru-
ments glint dimly in the harsh
fluorescent lighting. Decora-
tive curly-cues of golden dragon
tails morph into snarling snouts
that guard the massive instru-
ments upon which they perch.
The first question: "What is
this thing?"
The second: "CanI touch it?"
This monstrous and unique
instrument,aJavanesegamelan,
is the jewel of the Stearns Col-
lection of Musical Instruments.
Traditionally used to accom-
pany Javanese shadow-puppet
shows, this obscure instrument
is rarely found outside of East
Asia. Even though this mag-
nificent treasure is housed right
here on campus, many students
don't know of its existence.
Too bad the Stearns Col-
lection is similarly obscure. If
more students knew about it,
more would take the opportu-

nity to touch - and even play -
the gamelan.
It's not surprising that the
Stearns Collection is over-
looked - less than 5 percent of
its approximately 2,500 musical
instruments are permanently
displayed, and of this small per-
centage, the majority of the dis-
plays are tucked away in a widely
unpopulated wing of the School
of Music on North Campus.
This wasn't always the case,
though. Between 1914 and 1974,
the entire collection enjoyed
constant exposure and public-
ity. Housed in the upper lobby
of Hill Auditorium (where some
remnants of the old exhibit still
remain), the collection used
to be widely admired. Indeed,
according to the collection's
website, "many long-time Ann
Arborites still remember how
the displays looked" from this
time period.
So why the devolution? Why
should students care about
some moldy old instruments
that have fallen into obscurity?
What makes the Stearns Collec-
tion so special?
Originally donated to the
University in 1899 by Frederick

M. Stearns, a wealthy business-
man and pack rat from Detroit,
the collection is unique in that
Stearns collected everything.
Similar to his acquisitions of
parasols, mummies, conch
shells and mollusks, no instru-
ment was beyond Stearns's
interest.
Since then, the collection has
grown from Stearns's donation
of 940 instruments into a behe-
moth containing around 2,500.
Because of the efforts of several
individuals the collection has
earned world-wide notoriety
among selected circles. Past
director Robert A. Warner pro-
motedthe collectioninthe1950s
when an interest in authentic
performances with historically
accurate instruments arose.
Professors William Malm and
Judith Becker traveled to Asia
in the '60s and '70s and brought
backmany eastern instruments,
including one of the earliest
complete and playable Javanese
gamelans.

lection's online catalogue on
Google Books or actually visit-
ing the displays, one can under-

ProductionSeniorLecturer, Departmentof ScreenArts &Cultures
What are your favorite
avant-garde films?
1. "San Soleil" (1984), Chris Marker: The ultimate reflexive film about time, seeing, memory,
meaning and history. It is the "The Waste Land" as a motion picture.
2. "Nude on the Moon" (c. 1970), Doris Wishman: This might better fit the category of "Under-
ground Film." Wishman sets this outrageously artless science fiction film in a California nudist colo-
ny. Naked humanoids with aluminum foil antennae find thermselves on the moon.
3. "Mothlight" (1963), Stan Brakhage: Sublime - what can I say? A masterpiece made without
a film camera.
4. "Alpsee" (1994), Matthias Muller: A richly photographed psycho-drama without words (my
favorite kind of film). Move over Hitchcock and Sirk.
5. "But You Knew That Already" (2007), Sean Stewart: A brilliant film produced by one of our
own students who graduated a few years back. Enigmatic suburban angst in a coming-of-age drama.
It is one of the funniest films I have seen. There are almost no words.

TRAILER REVIEW
ASTRO BOY
SUMMIT
"I got machine guns? In my butt?" These are the last
words of the latest "Astro Boy" trailer, and the lines
manage to stand out from other more groan-worthy
gags. In the film, the big, bad military schemes to use
Astro Boy as an instrument of war. Heavy on curves
and light on textures, the film's graphic style is closer to
"The Incredibles" than the ancient anime on which the
film is based. Hopefully this adaptation will fare better
than the rainbow-vomit train wreck of last year's "Speed
Racer."

Obama's big prize

L ast week, the president
of the United States was
awarded the Nobel Prize for
Peace "for his extraordinary efforts
to strengthen
international 1
diplomacy and
cooperation
between peo-
ples." Naturally,l
there is only one
appropriate reac- ZACH
tion to news like SIMovL
this: disgust.
Like the Taliban, which shock-
ingly disagreed with the Norwegian
Nobel Committee's decision, many
on the political right in this coun-
try have also decried this terrible
injustice. As Rush Limbaugh put it
last Friday, "I'm on the same side of
something with the Taliban ... We
all are on the same side as the Tali-
ban." Now, I don't know if it was just
the pills talking, but Rush is right.
Today, we are all Taliban.
How could this have happened?
Popular conservative blogger and
founder of RedState.com Erick
Erickson provided one possibility:
"I did not realize the Nobel Peace
Prize had an affirmative action
quota for it, but that is the only thing'
I can think of for this news." Not a
bad thought. President Obama has
always been quick to play the race
card. Whether it was being born
black, being the first black editor of
the Harvard Law Review, the third
African American elected to the
Senate or the first black president,
this is clearly a guy who's only got-
ten to the top thanks to the color of
his skin.
Even on the left, many people
couldn't believe it. As prominent
lefty Barack Obama put it, "I do not
feel that I deserve to be in the com-
pany of so many of the transforma-
tive figures who've been honored by
this prize - men and women who've
inspired me and inspired the entire
world through their courageous
pursuit of peace." What a diva.
Also, let's not forget, the Nobel
Peace Prize is a storied and honored
award they don't give away to just
any guy off the street. You have to
really earn it. Whether it was noted
peace advocates like Yasser Arafat
(1994 laureate) or Henry Kissinger
(1973 laureate), you have to do at
least something transient and irrel-
evant before they give you one of
those giant, meaningless gold coins.
And besides, Barack Obama
hasn't done anything yet. As Alfred
Nobel put it in his will, the prize
should be given to the person who
"duringthe preceding year (..) shall
have done the most or the best work
for fraternity between nations, for
the abolition or reduction of stand-
ing armies and for the holding and
promotion of peace congresses."
Now this award has been sullied
by a guy whose only accomplish-
ments have been awakening a new
vision of American Exceptionalism
around the globe, re-engaging the
United States with an alienated and
hostile world, extending an open
hand of peace to Muslim nations,
working for the non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons, trying to broker a
new and lastingpeace in Israel, tak-
ing drastic steps to solve a complete
international financial meltdown
and, finally, quitting smoking. But

come on, what has he actually done?
But there is a silver lining. Thanks
to winning the Nobel Prize imme-
diately after his failing to bringthe
Olympic games to Chicago, a new
and exciting trend has taken the
anti-Obama movement by storm.
First, there were the "birthers"
who unraveled the decades-old
conspiracy that Obama was actually
born in Nairobi or Jakarta or some
other weird-sounding place. Then,
there were the "deathers," those
who discovered Obama's secret plan
to euthanize your grandmother
unless you worked for ACORN, reg-
istering illegal immigrants to vote
for federally funded gay abortions.
Now, we've got the "douchers."
This is a true and faithful Country
First crowd who celebrates when
America fails and woefully whines
when she succeeds. "Douchers"
want to alert Americans to the
dangers we face. And to do so, they
are willing to respond to events
in the most backwards way pos-
sible, just so everyone can see how
crazy Barack Obama's America has
become.
It was only a few years ago that
whenever people criticized the
execution of the war in Iraq or the
reasons for it, they were immediate-
ly accused of being in an Al-Qaeda
Today, we are
all Taliban.
sleeper cell. But Commie-Nazis
like Sean Penn and the rest of those
Hollywood elite were clearly low-
balling it. Firm, peaceful criticism is
so 2004.
These days, "douchers" know the
only real way to support America
is to ecstatically cheer and applaud
bad news for their country. This is
just the way the conservative group
Americans for Prosperity did on
camera when Chicago's failed Olym-
pic bid was announced. This is the
same organizing committee that
helped the voices of literally dozens
of tragically misinformed shut-ins
be heard at this summer's town hall
meetings. These "douchers" have
fought against our march toward
socialism (or fascism or communism
or progressivism, or whichever term
Glenn Beck prefers that day) by
shouting down a wheelchair-bound
woman with no insurance or a wait-
ress who couldn't pay for her child's
medical bills. Real "doucher" values.
But back to the story of the
week, Obama's sham Nobel Prize.
If I had my druthers, we would do
away with the award entirely. Only
Democratic presidents win anyway.
(Except for John McCain's declared
"hero" Teddy Roosevelt) But still, I
think it's time we started giving out
the Nobel Prize for Cognitive Dis-
sonance. It takes a Real American
to look at losing the Olympic games
and our president winningthe
Nobel Peace Prize and know when
you're supposed to boo and when
you're supposed to cheer. If you're
unsure, here's a hint: Just do the one
that feels wrong.
Smilovitz thinks Mike Huckabee
should've won this year's Prize. Give
Huck a shoutout at zachis@umich.edu.

A god among geeks

Jonathan Coulton makes
nerds everywhere proud
with his home-spun tunes
By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Daily TV/New Media Editor
One day, geeks will rule the world. Though
this just may sound like a mother's com-
forting words to her picked-on son, it has a
grain of truth. With the combined power of
the Internet and uniquely creative minds,
geeks have built a strong community and an
even stronger culture. With conferences like
Comic-Con, QuakeCon and PAX, TV chan-
nels like G4, gaming magazines like Game
Informer and masses of forums and websites
for every type of nerd imaginable, what was
once a shameful label is now thrust in our
faces wherever we look. It's impossible to
ignore the nerds' presence.
Former computer programmer Jonathan
Coulton doesn't just wear his badge of geek-
dom proudly - he spreads his love of the cul-
ture to the masses as the singer/songwriter
of some of today's most famous geek-rock
songs. Though he always had a love for music,
it wasn't until somewhat recently that he
made the transition from a steady paycheck
and systematic profession to the creative yet
unpredictable world of art.
"In general, I've always been interested in
singing," Coulton said in a phone interview
last week before his Thursday night show at
The Ark. "I grew up in a musical
family. We were always singing
and playing instruments and
I started writing somewhere
in maybe junior high or high
school when I picked up gui-
tar and started learning to play
that. You know, it was sort of a
lifelong hobby - just being able
to write and record for fun. It
wasn't until the end of 2005 that
I actually left the day job and
started doing the song-writing
thing full-time."
In September 2005, Coulton
started a creative experiment he
called "Thing a Week," where
he published one new song
every week for the duration of
a year. While such experiments
are more common now, four
years ago it was a pretty bold
endeavor.
"I was always sort of really
hating it," he said. "It was easy
the first couple weeks because I
had a few ideas that I had stored
up, and I guess when I was first i
starting it was pretty low pres-
sure. You know, nobody was lis-
tening. And then as I got into it
and ran out of ready-made ideas,
it was starting from scratch
every week and that - it's kind
of a terrifying place to be when
you're trying to create some-

thing and you're starting from absolutely
nothing."
Though his "Thing a Week" project was
taxing, it became an Internet sensation pro-
pelling him into fame and pushing him to a
new creative level.
"Frequently, the weeks that were worst for
me and where I spent the most time walking
around desperately trying to come up with
something and really hating myself and hat-
ing the whole project, those were the weeks
when the good stuff seemed to happen,"
Coulton explained. "And you know, I don't
know if it was digging deep as much as it was
just allowing strange things to happen out of
... desperation."
One of Coulton's most famous songs "Still
Alive" is probably best known as the credits
song for the popular video game "Portal." It
outlines the perspective of the game's antag-
onist, an artificially intelligent computer
named GLaDOS, after her defeat. Another
popular tune of his, "Code Monkey," follows
a computer programmer looking for love, and
in "Re: Your Brains" a zombie tries to ratio-

It's somewhat surprising that such a spe-
cific type of music could appeal to the mass-
es, but Coulton has found his niche and has
carved out a new genre that happens to work
out pretty well for him. He recently released a
live performance album, Best. Concert. Ever.,
and is constantly booked for shows.
"I'm not sure I would've guessed - in fact,
I'm quite certain I never would've guessed
- there'd be such a big market for nerd
rock," he said. "I believe that classic, solid
songwriting is going to reach people regard-
less of genre. (Popular music) has to reach
as many people as possible to be successful,
but when you're a guy like me, you're sort of
doing everything yourself, you. can afford
to be- a niche player. I can write stuff that's
really honest and true and you know, stuff I
really believe in."
Perhaps his honesty is what attracts peo-
ple to his music. For years, nerds were looked
down on in popular culture and encouraged
to hide what set them apart. In this new
era, geek is chic, truthfulness is revered
and bared emotions are encouraged. Last

STEARNS
From Page 1B
stand the collection's scope. In
addition to the Javanese gamelan,
Stearns also includes the first mass-
produced Moog synthesizer, the
RCA theremin used for the radio
program "The Green Hornet," a
collection of trumpets donated by
Armando Ghitalla (a former trum-
peter of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra), numerous rattles, reed
instruments, drums and horns
from different cultures around the
world and a fantastic collection of
forged instruments.
It's this wide range of instru-
ments that, according to Dr. Steven
Ball, assistant professor of music
and current director of the exhibit,
renders the collection unique.
"Stearns is the only collection (of
instruments) that has truly anthro-
pological origins," Ball said. "Each
instrument in the collection is a
product of its maker and of its time
and of its place."
Because the collection includes
so many diverse instruments, study
of the collection extends into the
realm of human culture.
A prime example of this anthro-
pological insight lies with the
forged instruments of the collec-
tion. Some of the keyboards origi-
nally donated by Stearns were
purchased from notorious Italian
forger Leopoldo Franciolini, whose
business boomed during the late
19th and early 20th century. In
one particularly incredible forg-
ery, Franciolini added two tiers of
keyboards to a basic harpsichord
and then scrawled the signature of
BarolomeoCristofori, awell-known
harpsichord maker from the 1700s
and inventor of the modern piano
forte, on to the instrument.
Inmostcases,anhistoricalobject
subjected to this level of tampering
would be viewed as a travesty. But
for Ball, who intends to create an
exhibit titled "Fantastic Forgeries,"
it's a blessing in disguise.
"When you boil the forgeries
down, usually at the core there are
many important pieces. Forgeries
aren'tjustdisposable, infactthey're
sort of like sleeping beauties," Ball
said. "We can learn about the origi-
nal instruments at the base of the
forgery and in this case, also learn
about the culture of 19th-century
museum world. And then there's
the whole aspect of Franciolini
himself. The instrument tells you
about the forger and the buyer."
"There are always new things
to discover about the instruments,
and they start to tell very long,
complex stories," he added.
Unfortunately, one of the stories
the Stearns instruments tell is a
sad one - while the collection was
growing during its golden years,
the instruments were also tarnish-
ing due to a lack of adequate preser-
vation techniques. A combination
of what Ball calls "a chronic lack

rializing an instrument in the name
of a relative. For example, let's say
you had an uncle who really loved
clarinets. You could pick a clari-
net from the collection, donate a
certain sum and have that instru-
ment be named in memory of your
uncle."
However, Stepanchuk firmly
believes that the best
way to help the collec-
tion get through (and
even grow in) these
economic times is to
partner with other
arts programs and reC
museums. She hopes
to see more collabora -of t
tions with other Uni-
versity departments,
like the Kelsey Muse- ho
um, the University N
Musical Society and b
the Exhibit Museum
in the future.
"In the past, we've
housed special exhib-
its in other muse-
ums," she said. "For
example, a couple of
years ago there was
a fantastic exhibit DIRE
at the Kelsey that
explored the idea
of reconstructing
ancient instruments and trying
to replicate the sounds and music
the instruments made. Frederick
Stearns also donated large parts of

his collection to other institutions,
like the mollusk collection in the
Exhibit Museum and the mummy
collection at the Detroit Institute
of Arts. We hope to consider col-
laborating with other recipients of
Stearns's massive collection."
All these ideas are subject to
change, however, and largely

depend on funding and public
interest.
Both Ball and Stepanchuk stress
the importance of students get-

ting involved with the collection,
whether in working as part of its
administration, taking a tour or
simply looking at the website. Ball
and Stepanchuk are eager to get in
contact with anyone with ideas for
an exhibit, instruments to donate
or just an interest in becoming
actively involved with the collec-
tion.
Most importantly, every-
one involved with Stearns
wishes to impress upon
the public just how unique
the collection is and why
it is worth preserving. Ball
emphasizes how important
it is to study these instru-
~'ments, interact with them
and preserve them for future
generations. He stresses that
every object is a concrete
piece of history worth pre-
serving.
"That's why museums are
critically important: The
information that the instru-
ments contain is stable so
long as the instruments exist
-it's its ownrecord of itself,"
Ball said. "And because of
thermodynamics, the second
law - entropy - all things
go to hell basically over time,
everything is deteriorating.
Museums are a really critical part
of the networks that house infor-
mation because they are advocates
for preservation."

--------------- - --- - - -

The Stearns Collection was established in
of funding" and a lack of interest
caused the collection to nose dive
into its current condition, with the
collection split and the manage-
ment changing hands.
Appointed on June 1, 2009 as
the collection's new director, Ball
has many ideas to counterbalance
the collection's distressing situa-
tion. His goals focus on stabilizing
and expanding the collection in
addition to getting the community,
especially students, more moti-
vated and involved. Tentative plans
are being proposed to the Univer-
sity regarding a unified, larger
space in which the collection could
be permanently housed. Ball hopes
to acquire such a space within the
next five years.
Students should also expect to
see a new website for the collection
that may contain one of Ball's other
initiatives - an online catalogue of
the Stearns instruments directed
specifically toward student use.
Ball also extends a campus-
wide call for any antique or unique
instruments that may be "looking
for a home." In the spirit of the col-
lection's founder, Ball is extremely
interested in expanding the col-
lection and will take a look at any
instrument. He asserts that this is
a new direction, as the directors
of the past three decades have not
shown much interest in increasing
the collection's size.
The most promising plans for

the future will hopefully be real-
ized in extending the collection's
current outreach programs in the
form of lectures, performances and
tours. Ball believes that "when you
stand in front of an instrument,
you should have the ability to expe-
rience it." Instruments cannot be
fully appreciated when they are
immobile and behind glass.
Carol Stepanchuk, docent of the
Stearns Collection and head tour
guide, couldn't agree more. While
working with the collection for the
past four years, Stepanchuk has
taken many individuals on tours
and attests to the power a tactile
connection with the instrument
can have.
"Sometimes students find it very
therapeutic to play the instru-
ments, especially the gamelan," she
said. "There's just something about
that instrument that can take stress
away."
Stepanchuk seems hopeful that
under Ball, the collection will flour-
ish. She is up for the implementa-
tion of his new ideas and even has a
few suggestions of her own.
"In the past, Stearns has had
an 'adopt an instrument' program
where individuals can become the
guardians of an instrument in poor
condition - they restore the instru-
ment and keep it in good condition
until the collection wants to house
it again," she said.
"There is also the idea of memo-

'MYSTICAL NINJA STARRING GOEMON'(1998) N64
Even if it doesn't translate, 'Mystical Ninja' endures

By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
There havebeenmanysuccessful
Japanese games released in Ameri-
ca - "Mega Man" and "Harvest
Moon" immediately come to mind
- that sport relatable characters
and universal gameplay, stretching
the games' fanbase across oceans.
And then there's Goemon, the
wacky, pipe-swinging ninja with a
hairdo that resembles a giant blue
pineapple and his robot doppel-
ganger who boxes other robots.
Goemon stars in the "Mysti-
cal Ninja" series, which was quite
possibly the most bizarre group of
Japanese games aimed at popular
American audiences in the 1990s.
(This throne, naturally, has been
reclaimed in recent years by the
"Katamari Damacy" games.) The
best, and easily the strangest of the
bunch was "Mystical Ninja Starring
Goemon" for the Nintendo 64, the
fifth game in the series but only the

second released in North America.
After playing through "Star-
ring Goemon" with all the head
scratching and constant utter-
ances of "What the hell?," it should
become obvious why only one more
entry, the enjoyable but infinitely
more frustrating "Goemon's Great
Adventure," ever found its way to
American store shelves.
At first glance, the games
wouldn't seem that difficult to sell.
After all, the action-adventure
gameplay, town exploring and epic
quests merged the best bits from
the Mario and Zelda series. In the
game, there is strategy involved in
switching between the four play-
able characters and their special
abilities (Goemon, his flatulent
best friend Ebismaru, tea-drinking
robot Sasuke and half-mermaid
Yae), as well as plenty of variety
between the on-foot segments and
the robot battles that basically play
out like first-person "Punch-Out!!"
For whatever weirdness "Mys-

tical Ninja" lacked in gameplay, it
more than made up for it in story
and presentation. You're barely
five minutes into the game before
a giant, peach-shaped spaceship
lands on Mt. Fuji. After Goemon
fights his way to the ship, he discov-

Naturally, the only way to stop
him is to ride on the backs of drag-
on gods, teleport with the help of
magic tea houses and equip robots
with roller skates so they can pull
off extreme tricks while destroy-
ing entire towns in the name of the

thing like that. And he reveals all translation and my own unfamil-
of this through a song-and-dance iarity with Japanese culture. For
number. With a laugh track. example, the character of Goemon

is based on a legendary bandit from
the 1500s who was essentially
the Japanese Robin Hood, steal-
ing gold from the rich and giving
it to the poor. (One of video-game
Goemon's abilities is to hurl stolen
coins as projectile weapons.) Not
to mention that the villain's seem-
ingly nonsensical theater obsession
is actually modeled after kabuki, an
ancient Japanese performance art.
Had these things been apparent to a
certain young American boy at the
time, I mighthave had more respect
for the game beyond laughing at the
silly hair.
But there's no denying that the
pure ridiculousness of "Mystical
Ninja" is what's kept it alive in my
memory all these years, long after
other generic action-adventures
faded away. And even pulling back
all the silliness, there's still a very
strong game to explore. The puz-
zles are challenging, the in-game
trek across Japan is daunting in all
the right ways and the feeling you

get upon seeing the countryside for
the first time is comparable to that
warm-and-fuzzy sensation of rid-
ing into the sunrise on horseback
in "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of
Time." Plus, you learn a ton about
Japanese geography, thanks to the
talking dogs along the way.
And maybe it's just a side effect
of the translation, but much of the
humor can be refreshingly dis-
arming. Take the gatekeepers who
guard the entrance to Goemon's
hometown,whotellyouthatthey're
just going to keep standing in the
same exact spot until you've beaten
the game. "Kinda painful ... kinda
depressing," one of the guards says.
It's enough to make you feel for all
the other non-player characters
in all the other adventure games
you've ever played. In instances
like this, "Mystical Ninja" may not
know how to appeal to a main-
stream American audience, but it
does know how embody the soul of
a damn good video game.
