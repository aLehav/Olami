U-M sued by Speech First
over Bias Response Team

Organization files 
injunction against 
“U” over free speech 
 

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

The University of Michigan is 

the first university in the nation to 
receive a federal lawsuit regarding 
the effect the U-M Bias Response 
Team might have on speech 
freedom on campus. 

On Tuesday, Speech First, an 

organization of students, citizens 
and alumni advocating free speech 
on college campuses, filed a federal 
lawsuit against the University, 
challenging the Bias Response 
Team’s accordance with the U.S. 
Constitution and calling for a 
permanent injunction prohibiting 
the Bias Response Team from 
investigating students.

Speech First President Nicole 

Neily said the organization is 
filing the injunction against the 
University based on three main 

factors.

“We have multiple members of 

the organization at the University,” 
Neily said. “The University of 
Michigan also has a combination 
of a very bad speech code that 
is very vague, a very active bias 
response team that is very proud of 
its achievements because it keeps 
a log and we have numbers there, 
though not all were listed in the 
complaint. These were the three 
things we needed.”

This is not the first time the 

University’s 
speech 
code 
and 

freedom of speech has been called 
into question. In 2017, hundreds of 
students flooded into the Michigan 
League to voice displeasure with 
the Michigan Political Union’s 
decision to debate the Black Lives 
Matter movement as harmful to 
racial relations, causing many 
people outside of the University 
to question whether unpopular 
voices or perspectives can be 
heard at the University. Similarly, 
when Charles Murray, author of 
“The Bell Curve,” a book which 
argues for the concept of racial 

differences in intelligence, spoke 
at the University, several students 
attempted to shut down the event.

The University has experienced 

controversy on the speech code 
as far back as 1989. A 1989 case, 
Doe v. University of Michigan, 
determined the University’s 1988 
hate speech law violated the 
constitutional right to free speech. 

Neily claims freedom of speech 

and the campus atmosphere are 
stifled by vague and subjective 
speech codes and bias response 
teams. 

“It is very difficult to have a 

system in place (like a bias response 
team) without having a mechanism 
that kills speech,” Neily said. “I fail 
to see how you can have that kind 
of system without entirely stifling 
free speech.”

According to the University’s 

Bias Response Team website, 
a bias incident is anything that 
discriminates against a community 
based on their identity.

New pill
can detect
breast cancer
Researchers at “U” 
develop pill to reduce 
overtreatment 

By NATSAHA PIETRUSCHKA 

Daily Staff Reporter

Researchers at the University of 

Michigan are developing a new diagnostic 
pill that improves conventional detection 
methods and reduces the overtreatment 
of breast cancer. The U-M research 
team, led by Greg Thurber, chemical 
engineering 
assistant 
professor, 
is 

refining an oral pill that dissolves in the 
bloodstream and illuminates tumors 
under infrared light.

According to Thurber, many women 

who have breast cancer tumors would 
never suffer from the disease but are 
treated 
anyway. 
Mammography, 
a 

common form of breast cancer detection, 
determines the existence of a tumor but 
not if the tumor is cancerous or benign. 
Chemicals in the new pill are able to bind 
to cancerous tissue and light up under 
infrared light to inform physicians where 
cancerous tumors are located.

Thurber 
says 
that 
knowing 

information at the molecular level is at 
the core of effective cancer detection.

“We’ve known from decades of 

research in cancer biology that it’s really 
a molecular disease, so what’s nice about 
our approach is that you’re actually 
getting molecular information,” Thurber 
said.

The 
pill 
is 
an 
alternative 
to 

mammograms or other methods such 
as magnetic resonance imaging and 
ultrasounds. According to Thurber, 
mammograms 
can 
sometimes 
be 

inaccurate, as they may miss tumors in 
women with dense breast tissue.

Thurber believes his team’s method 

would be useful at spotting tumors in 
patients where mammograms don’t work 
well.

Ann Arbor voters
approve millage

Citizens decide 
to increase 
school millage
By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

The vast majority of Ann Arbor 
voters Tuesday opted to increase the 
funds collected by public schools. 
The millage renewal proposed by the 
Ann Arbor Public Schools Board of 
Education passed with 76 percent in 
favor.
A school millage rate is a decided 
amount of money per $1,000 of 
property value that goes toward 
property tax, which in turn funds 
public schools. In Ann Arbor, this 
tax is the public school system’s 
main source of revenue. Members 
of the AAPS Board of Education say 
the operating millage affected by 
Tuesday’s vote will impact the taxes 
levied on non-homestead properties, 
including businesses and rental 
properties, rather than homeowners.
Effective for the next 20 years, the 
vote renewed the existing millage 
of 18 mills, or dollars per $1,000 

value, and added an upper limit of 
21 mills. The new 3-mill cushion 
gives the AAPS Board of Education 
more flexibility in dealing with the 
Headlee Amendment, a decades-
old piece of state legislation that 
allows towns to roll back millages 
when 
property 
values 
increase 
more quickly than inflation. The 
amendment was designed to limit 
property taxes, but according to 
Board President Christine Stead, it 
complicates school funding. Stead 
claims rising property values coupled 
with the Headlee Amendment have 
produced financial losses for the Ann 
Arbor public school system.
“Even though property values are 
increasing, you’re going to be at a 
slower-paced recovery because of the 
Headlee Amendment,” Stead said. 
“The gap can get bigger and bigger, 
and so for us, the Ann Arbor Public 
School 
District, 
that 
difference 
between what we’re collecting and 
what we should be collecting is equal 
to $1.3 million.”

Students criticize 
 
lack of response 
from University

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

 
The University of Michigan 
claimed 
it 
is 
continuing 
to 
investigate a vulgar scavenger 
hunt list that went viral nearly two 
weeks ago detailing numerous 
sexual acts and calls for public 
nudity and using a racial slur.
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen 
explained 
there 
are no new developments in the 
investigation. In addition, The 
Michigan Daily and the Office 
of Public Affairs and Internal 
Communications were unable to 
contact the Division of Student 
Life investigating the incident 
because its members were at a 
retreat.
Meanwhile, LSA senior Casey 
Jong, who first posted the list on 
Facebook under the title “The 
Elite Bar Crawl,” said she has yet 
to be contacted by the University, 
the Interfraternity Council, the 
Division of Student Life or the 
Bias Response Team with which 
she filed her complaint.
“On my (bias) report I indicated 
that I would be willing to provide 
further information if needed,” 
Jong 
said. 
“Other 
than 
the 
automatic email indicating they 

had received my complaint, they 
never contacted me again.”
Despite the lack of information 
and communication with the 
University, Jong has received 
plenty of positive feedback from 
people just as frustrated with the 
racism and sexism detailed on the 
list. 
“There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
comments and I did get a few 
messages, but they’re pretty much 
all in support of investigating 
and 
getting 
the 
responsible 
parties off campus and putting 
pressure on the University to see 
real repercussions,” Jong said. 
“Nobody has contacted me or told 
me that I have been spreading lies 
outside of the AEPi international 
member who was quoted by The 
Daily.”
Jong explained the list could 
be traced back to the fraternity 
Alpha Epsilon Pi because she 
received the list via a group 
message containing several AEPi 
members. In addition, Jong said 
several of the redacted names on 
the list belong to AEPi members 
or women associated with AEPi 
members.
The list also features several 
acts that could only be performed 
by female participants, such as, 
“Call your mom tell her you’re 
pregnant.”

“In the short term, we wouldn’t be 
necessarily replacing a mammogram; 
we would be trying to provide more 
information to the physician so that they 
could make better decisions from the 
results they would get from both this 
imaging and a mammogram,” Thurber 
said. “Long term, the idea would be to 
completely replace (mammograms) 
because there are many challenges 
with mammograms that we believe our 
approach can help overcome.”
Providing more accurate screening 
results is also comforting to patients. 
Rackham student Sumit Bhatnagar 
assisted with the research for the 
project and emphasized the importance 
of reducing the overtreatment of breast 
cancer.
“When you have a lot of patients 
that have to go through chemotherapy 

and all these procedures that are not 
required, it leads to a loss of quality in life 
for a lot of these people,” Bhatnagar said. 
“So that’s something that can be avoided 
in the screening stage that would be 
preferable.”
The pill is taken orally and dissolves 
into the bloodstream, just like food, 
says Thurber. The carefully-designed 
molecules are distributed throughout 
the body and bind onto breast cancer 
cells. After a few days, a physician looks 
for tumors by shining a near-infrared 
light on the breasts.
Pharmaceutical sciences professor 
David Smith assisted Thurber’s team 
with the research. According to Smith, 
one of the team’s challenges was assuring 
the molecule was correctly absorbed 
by the body. The team had to design a 
molecule that was soluble enough to be 
absorbed into the bloodstream, but also 
greasy enough to pass through a tumor 
cell’s membrane.
“It has to have the right chemical 

structure to have selectivity for cancer 
cells and not normal regular cells,” 
Smith said. “So you can imagine getting 
all those qualities in one molecule is not 
so easy.”
According to Bhatnagar, the research 
team created a range of different 
imaging agents with varying properties 
to see which combination of properties 
would work best in the body.
“We did cell experiments and plate 
experiments to eliminate a few of 
these, so based on certain properties we 
narrowed it down from the five or six 
to about three, which we then tested in 
mice to see which one was the one we 
could get the highest amount of into the 
blood,” Bhatnagar said.
With successful results on mice, the 
team is looking to expand the method 
for not only other types of cancer, but 
other diseases as well.

Holocaust survivor shares 

her memoir at local library

Retired Public 
Health professor 
presents book

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

Author Irene Butter, a retired Pub-

lic Health professor, presented her book 

“Shores Beyond Shores, From Holocaust 

to Hope: My True Story” at the Ann Arbor 

District Library Tuesday evening. Original-

ly from Berlin, Butter is a survivor of Bergen-

Belsen concentration camp. She arrived in 

the United States on Dec. 24, 1945.

The Holocaust lasted from 1941 to 1945, 

where Jews and other groups were sys-

tematically tortured and exterminated by 

the Nazis throughout camps in Europe. 

According to the United States Holocaust 

Memorial Museum, approximately 6 mil-

lion Jews, and many others from other 

groups, were killed.

Library Director Josie Parker intro-

duced Butter, giving positive reviews of 

Butter’s book for its enlightening and mov-

ing content.

“It’s a very different story than many 

of you might think of or read in the past 

regarding the Holocaust,” Parker said. “It’s 

inspiring. It’s moving. It awakens your spirit 

in a time when we really that.”

Butter began by explaining how she 

came about to write the book with her co-

authors, Kris Holloway and John Bidwell. 

Holloway was a former student of Butter’s 

and Butter met Bidwell through her. She 

explained that their goal was to recapture 

childhood memories Butter had at each 

stage of her Holocaust experience.

“The guiding principle throughout our 

journey was to recapture the (course) of the 

child at each stage in this narrative,” Butter 

said. “There are many memoirs about the 

Holocaust, yet how children lived through 

these experiences, what they heard, what 

they saw and what they felt has really been 

revealed.”

Holloway felt it was important to docu-

ment what life was like for Irene before the 

Holocaust began.

“An important part for me of writing the 

book was to portray the early years before 

all the horror happened,” Holloway said.

Holloway then went on to read a section 

of the book detailing Butter’s first experi-

ence seeing a “Jews Forbidden” sign while 

biking.

Bidwell then read a section of the book 

detailing Butter’s experience in Bergen-

Belsen as the camp became overcrowded 

and hunger more prevalent.

“As the food hit my lips, my body wanted 

to slurp down every last drop and chew 

every last crumb,” Bidwell read. “Maybe, 

maybe this is how vampires feel about 

blood.”

After working with Detroit and Ann 

Arbor students, Butter explained that she 

feels students see the importance of toler-

ance and have a desire for stories that bring 

hope.

“Students recognize that all of us are 

responsible for each other regardless of our 

color, religion or race,” Butter said. “We are 

all hungry for stories of hope and triumph 

over tragedy.”

Butter explained the impact of a mar-

riage between her Jewish daughter and a 

Palestinian man.

“My granddaughters were born in 

Israel to a Jewish mother, my daughter, 

and a Palestinian father,” Butter said. “This 

has not always been easy for them. But I’ve 

learned that the surest path to peace may be 

when the other becomes your own.”

In a question and answer portion, But-

ter answered a question regarding what 

“Never Again,” a phrase dedicated to geno-

cide awareness, means to her.

“‘Never Again’ is a wish,” Butter said. 

“So far, I would say it has been an unfulfilled 

promise. Just seeing it doesn’t make it hap-

pen. I think a lot more has to go on before 

‘Never Again’ can become a reality.”

Butter then reflected upon her relation-

ship with Anne Frank. Although she did 

not know her well, Butter lived near Frank 

when in Amsterdam, and eventually ended 

up at Bergen-Belsen with her. Butter was 

friends with Frank’s close friend Hanneli 

Goslar, and the two threw clothes to Frank 

when she did not have any in Bergen-

Belsen.

“One day she (Hanneli) found out that 

Anne was in a joining (camp) separated by 

barbed wire,” Butter said. “She found out 

her sister (Margot) was too sick to come to 

the fence and she didn’t have any clothing, 

only a grey blanket wrapped around her, so 

Hanneli said she would try and find some 

clothing and come back the next night.”

Butter explained that the next day some-

one else picked up the clothing bundle they 

threw over the fence, but the pair tried again 

with another bundle and Frank received it.

Ann Arbor resident Helen Aminoff‘s 

family came to the United States from 

England at the beginning of World War II 

without any trouble. At the event, Aminoff 

explained she felt fortunate that her fam-

ily could come to the US before the borders 

closed.

“We were very fortunate,” Aminoff said. 

“We did not have anyone who died in the 

Holocaust. I have so many friends who lost 

family members. I usually get very annoyed 

with people who deny the Holocaust and 

say it didn’t happen. It’s not true. Check your 

facts.”

“A bias incident is conduct 
that discriminates, stereotypes, 
excludes, 
harasses 
or 
harms 
anyone 
in 
our 
community 
based on their identity (such as 
race, color, ethnicity, national 
origin, sex, gender identity or 
expression, sexual orientation, 
disability, age or religion),” the 
website states.
Ultimately, the lawsuit filed by 
Speech First questions whether 
the opportunity to report bias 
incidents and mete out justice 
stifles the atmosphere at the 
University. Speech First also 
challenges the legitimacy of the 
bias reports filed and focuses on 
the vague terminology on the 
Bias Response Team website. 
The University’s Bias Response 
website explains a bias incident 
can 
be 
anything 
inciting 
uncomfortable “feelings.”
“Bias comes in many forms. 
It can be a hurtful action based 
on who someone is as a person,” 
the website states. “The most 
important indication of bias is 
your own feelings.”
The 
Bias 
Response 
Team 
allows students to file complaints 
and follows up the reports by 

investigating the incidents and 
the students involved. The Bias 
Response Team reacts to incidents 
such as the blackface Snapchat 
mocking 
#BlackLivesMatter 
during the spring term and the 
racial slurs written on dorm door 
name tags during the fall term, by 
investigating the incidents and 
using a detailed log to explain 
the steps taken to respond to the 
racist incidents. 

While 
the 
Bias 
Response 
Team seeks to eliminate hateful 

and harmful speech, Speech 
First seeks to protect all student 
voices, even if they might be 
unpopular.
“In 
recent 
years, 
colleges 
have adopted various policies 
— including speech codes, ‘safe 
spaces,’ and ‘free speech zones’ 
— with the goal of shutting 
down unwanted speech,” the 
Speech First website states. “The 
message is clear: Students with 
unconventional 
ideas 
should 
shut up and keep their opinions 
to themselves. Censoring speech 
infringes the rights of students to 
express their opinions on campus. 
Just as important, it harms the 
rights of other students to listen 
to the speech — to challenge, 
debate, and learn from the views 
of their fellow students.”
The University is one of several 
universities in the nation with 
a bias response team, but the 
first to receive a federal lawsuit. 
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen declined to 
comment regarding the lawsuit.
“We haven’t been served a 
copy of the lawsuit and have 
no 
comment 
at 
this 
time,” 
Broekhuizen wrote.

Edited and managed by students at 
the University of Michigan since 1890.

A 

s a student of political science 
and international studies at 
the University of Michigan, 
I have learned about human rights 
atrocities across the globe from the 
Rwandan Genocide to the Rohingya 
Crisis in Myanmar. In these courses, 
I have learned that a fundamental 
human right is freedom 
from 
discrimination based on any identity 
including race, ethnicity and gender. 
These courses have touched on 
human rights concerns in the United 
States such as suffrage for women 
and human trafficking. Not once have 
I heard of Jim Crow laws referred to 
as human rights violations or seen the 
Civil Rights Movement addressed in 
a class focused on human rights. The 
Civil Rights Movement was a fight 
for human rights and, as such, should 
not be excluded from conversations 
or classes about human rights. 
On Tuesday, March 20th, Carol 
Anderson came to the University 
of Michigan to give a lecture about 
her most recent book “White Rage” 
which addresses the reactions of 
White Americans throughout history 
to combat attempts to provide Black 
Americans with equality and human 
rights. Earlier that day, I had the 
privilege of meeting Dr. Anderson 
through an International Institute 
event. Anderson told us about her 
first book “Eyes off the Prize: The 
United Nations and the African-
American 
Struggle 
for 
Human 
Rights, 1944-1955.” She spoke about 
the groundbreaking research that 
she did while writing this book, 
linking the movements together 
in a way that had never been done 

before. She treated the Civil Rights 
Movement as an extension of the 
human rights movement of the time. 
This perspective made me stop and 
think; I had never heard these two 
movements connected before. As Dr. 
Anderson described the Civil Rights 
Movement as a fight for human rights, 
I realized that the conversation about 
human rights is still incomplete.
The Civil Rights Movement was 
a human rights movement. Black 
Americans were fighting for rights 
as citizens of the United States, rights 
that have also been recognized by 
the international community as 
fundamental human rights. The 
Civil Rights Movement fought for the 
equal treatment of Black Americans 
during the time of Jim Crow laws. 
Jim 
Crow 
laws 
discriminated 
against Black Americans based on 
their race and prevented them from 
receiving equal access to education 
and public services. Under the 
Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights of which the United States is 
a signer, all humans have a right to 
education and equal access to public 
services. Under this document, all 
people specifically have the right to 
freedom from discrimination. The 
Civil Rights Movement fought for 
Black Americans’ access to these 
universal human rights making it just 
as relevant in the history of human 
rights as any other movement.
Civil rights movements in other 
countries, such as the movement 
against Apartheid in South Africa, 
are referred to in the framework of 
human rights so the American Civil 
Rights Movement should be as well. 

Apartheid called for the separation 
of citizens of the same nation 
based on their racial identities and 
appearances. Black South Africans 
were separated from their White 
counterparts and treated as second-
class citizens, much like Black 
Americans were in the Civil Rights 
Movement. There is no reason for two 
such similar moments in history to be 
treated differently in the academic 
context. Black American Civil Rights 
should be included in the framework 
of human rights education.
The conversation about human 
rights needs to be expanded to 
make room for discussion of the 
Civil Rights Movement. One way 
to accomplish this on campus is 
greater collaboration between the 
International 
Institute 
and 
the 
Department 
for 
Afroamerican 
and African Studies. International 
studies 
courses 
focusing 
on 
human rights should utilize this 
collaboration to better include the 
Civil Rights Movement in their 
curriculum. The two departments 
are already making progress with 
this event featuring Dr. Anderson. 
However, 
the 
Donia 
Human 
Rights Center should use increased 
collaboration with the Department 
for 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 
Studies as an opportunity to host 
more events focusing on this issue 
to encourage students to think of 
Black Americans’ civil rights as 
human rights.

Republicans’ Medicaid madness
E

arlier 
this 
year, 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s administration 
told state Medicaid 
directors it would 
support 
states 
seeking 
waivers 
to 
impose 
work 
requirements 
for 
people 
covered 
by 
the 
public 
health 
insurance 
program— 
a 
partnership 
between the federal 
government 
and 
the 50 states plus 
the 
District 
of 
Columbia. So far, 
Kentucky, 
Indiana, 
Arkansas and New Hampshire 
have received these waivers 
and it is estimated over a 
million people will be affected 
by these work requirements.
In 
April, 
the 
Michigan 
state Senate passed their own 
Medicaid 
work 
requirement 
bill, Senate Bill 897, that would 
require “able-bodied” enrollees 
to document at least 29 hours of 
work, education or job training 
per week lest they lose their 
health coverage. Off the bat, I 
should note other states that 
have already implemented work 
requirements, or have asked for 
waivers to do so, set them at 
only 20 hours per week. So even 
by their fellow Republicans’ 
standards, S.B. 897 proposed 
by state Sen. Mike Shirkey, 
R-Clarklake, is extreme.
The bill is currently in the 
state House of Representatives 
and has the support of Speaker 
Tom 
Leonard, 
R-DeWitt. 
Luckily, 
Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder, 
whose one silver lining may 
be his support of Medicaid, 
believes 
this 
bill 
to 
be 
unreasonable and will likely 
veto it. However, according to 
Leonard, Shirkey is working 
with the governor’s office to 
make changes to S.B. 897. The 
only solution I can suggest is to 
burn the bill.
The logic behind Shirkey’s 
bill is simple enough to follow. 
Medicaid is expensive, costing 
Michigan 30.2 percent of its 
budget in 2016. Republicans’ 
solution? 
Use 
work 
requirements to force people 
off of the program. Under less-
stringent work requirements 
like those in place in Kentucky, 
approximately 
150,000 

Michiganders would lose their 
Medicaid coverage resulting 
in a 15-percent reduction in 
enrollment. 
The 
impact of S.B. 897 
would be even more 
devastating.
To be fair, there 
is an urgency in 
reducing the cost of 
Medicaid 
because 
the legislation that 
created the Healthy 
Michigan program, 
an 
expansion 
of 
Medicaid 
under 
Obamacare, 
has 
a 
provision 
that 
would 
shut 
the 
program down if net 
costs outweigh net savings. 
If 
that 
happens, 
Michigan 
will revert to pre-expansion 
Medicaid rules and thousands 
would lose coverage. However, 
just because work requirements 
are a solution does not make it 
the right solution for Michigan.
The 
basic 
logic 
behind 
work requirements, as far 
as I can tell, is that they 
will eventually lead people 
either 
to 
employer-based 
private health insurance or 
to a family income above 
138 percent of the federal 
poverty line, the cutoff under 
Medicaid expansion.
While Obamacare did reduce 
the medically uninsured rate 
in this country, there is still 
the problem of the Medicaid 
coverage gap, an unfortunate 
circumstance where a person 
or family makes too much 
to qualify for Medicaid but 
not 
enough 
to 
qualify 
for 
Obamacare 
subsidies 
to 
help pay for private health 
insurance. And what about 
employer-provided 
health 
insurance? Well, that workplace 
benefit is rapidly disappearing 
(though state legislators may 
not have noticed seeing as 
they have coverage). Per the 
Kaiser 
Family 
Foundation, 
only 57 percent of surveyed 
employers 
in 
2015 
offered 
health insurance to at least 
some of their employees and 
expect workers to contribute, 
on average, 29 percent of the 
premium for family plans.

HANNAH HARSHE | COLUMN

I

’m standing in the doorway 
of Shannon’s room. She’s 
sitting on her bed, her laptop 
on her lap with an 
episode of “New Girl” 
paused on the screen. 
We’re yelling at each 
other, over each other, 
really. Our voices are 
growing 
increasingly 
loud and angry, and 
people walking down 
the street outside our 
apartment are probably 
wondering 
whether 
we’re safe.
For the record, yes, 
we’re safe, but I’m pissed 
and so is she. We’re arguing over 
what is probably the most trivial 
thing a person could possibly 
argue over and we know it, but we 
also both know that we’re right, 
so the conversation isn’t going 
to end anytime soon. Shannon 
mentions most girls are pretty 
and very few girls are average-
looking. I counter that according 
to the definition of the word 
“average,” most girls are average-
looking, even if that means that 
average-looking girls are also 
pretty. From there, we begin 
arguing. I pull out my laptop to 
look up the dictionary definition 
of 
“average,” 
we’re 
holding 
whiteboards and plotting what 
we believe are the distributions 
of various levels of attractiveness. 
I thought it’s definitely a bell 
curve, but Shannon’s adamant 
that it’s skewed to the left, and, 
yep, we’re yelling.
After about 15 minutes of 
arguing, I walk out of the room 
and 
say 
she’s 
annoying 
me 
and I don’t want to talk to her 
anymore. She asks if I want to go 
to Starbucks. I say yes, and we 
put on our shoes and go. Neither 
of us ever concedes or apologizes, 
but later that afternoon, Shannon 
says to me, “I’m thankful that 
I have a roommate I can get in 
yelling matches with.”
Unfortunately, not everyone is 
so appreciative of situations in 
which women loudly voice their 
opinions. In her study “Who 
Takes the Floor and Why,” Yale 
researcher Victoria L. Brescoll 
determined that when a male CEO 
speaks more often than his peers, 
professional men and women 
consider him to be 10 percent 
more competent than his peers. 
However, when a female CEO 
speaks more often than her peers, 

she’s perceived to be 14 percent less 
competent than her peers.
Seemingly 
confirming 
this 
viewpoint, in a board 
meeting 
for 
Uber 
last June, Arianna 
Huffington 
spoke 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
women 
on the board, saying 
when more women 
join, it shows other 
women 
that 
they 
can feel comfortable 
joining. 
“Actually, 
what 
it 
shows 
is 
that it’s much more 
likely to be more talking,” David 
Bonderman, who was on the board 
at the time, infamously replied. 

He 
resigned 
after 
receiving 
pushback for this comment.
This is a pervasive attitude in 
the workplace: When men talk a 
lot it’s because they’re smart, but 
when women talk a lot it’s simply 
because 
they’re 
opinionated. 
Further, anger is typically seen 
as a positive quality in a man but 
a negative quality in a woman. 
Brescoll elaborates on this in a 
New York Times article, stating, 
“Men are less often punished 
for (showing anger), but they are 
actually seen as more deserving 
of power, status and higher 
salaries. By contrast, women who 
show even mild forms of anger are 
often viewed as emotionally ‘out 
of control’ and are less likely to 
be hired and advanced to higher 
positions within their firms.”
So how do people respond to 
women who have strong opinions 
and anger? They interrupt these 

women. A study found that male 
Supreme Court justices interrupt 
their female colleagues more, 
ignore their ideas and ultimately 
hinder them from moving up in 
the workplace. 
In a few short years, Shannon 
and I will be moving out of our 
apartment 
at 
the 
University 
of Michigan and starting our 
careers. The days of our yelling 
matches will be behind us and 
we’ll no longer stand in her 
bedroom 
growing 
genuinely 
angry, desperate to prove who’s 
right. We’ll still be the same 
people, just as adamant and 
bold and strong in our beliefs 
as we are now, but we’ll hold 
those qualities in our workplaces 
instead. If we were men, this 
would be perceived as a good 
thing; we’d be seen as smart 
and confident. But because we 
happen to be women, we’ll likely 
be punished for those qualities.
So, I guess, this is my formal 
promise: In two years, or five 
years or 10 years or however long 
it takes me to get a real job, I 
will not give up the tenacity that 
keeps me standing in Shannon’s 
bedroom, determined to prove 
that I’m right. Never in a million 
years would I let Shannon talk 
over me or let her imply my 
opinions are wrong. When I’m in 
the workplace, I refuse to give up 
that adamant, determined spirit. 
I hope Shannon doesn’t give up 
hers either.
It’s easier said than done, 
I’m sure. Women face so much 
backlash for being angry and 
opinionated, and retaining those 
qualities 
into 
the 
workplace 
puts your career at risk and is 
not realistic for everyone who 
needs to keep their job. But I 
know who I am: I’m the girl who 
can engage random strangers in 
debates about Michigan football, 
and I’m the girl who always 
finds herself in a yelling match 
with Shannon over something as 
shallow as what constitutes an 
“average-looking girl.” If I were a 
man, this confidence would be a 
career asset. To my fellow college 
women, let’s make a pact: When 
we enter the workplace, let’s 
refuse to let anyone turn our bold 
spirits into liabilities.

Furthermore, the nature 
of employment in America 
has 
become 
part-time; 
6 
million Americans have part-
time jobs but want full-time 
employment. 
Twenty-five 
percent of part-time workers 
live in poverty and would 
likely qualify for Medicaid. 
Part-time 
work 
and 
the 
associated job insecurity also 
leads to worse mental health. 
Imagine adding the potential 
of losing Medicaid coverage 
or a family’s coverage to 
the mix. Chronic stress is 
linked 
to 
many 
physical 
health 
problems 
including 
cardiovascular 
disease. 
Conditions 
like 
diabetes 
can also worsen with stress. 
Programs like Medicaid are 
meant to improve health, not 
make people sick.
Even if work requirements 
did have a positive impact 
on 
people, 
how 
many 
people would be affected? 
According 
to 
the 
Kaiser 
Family Foundation, only 7 
percent of Medicaid enrollees 
are not working for a reason 
other than disability, school 
attendance 
or 
caregiving. 
Furthermore, 25 percent of 
workers, such as seasonal 
workers, who would meet 
the 
29 
hours 
per 
week 
requirement on average would 
risk losing their Medicaid 
because they cannot meet the 
requirement 
every 
month. 
In another cruel twist to the 
already toxic bill, there is no 
exemption for caregivers of 
children up to thirteen years 
old despite the efforts of state 
Sen. Rebekah Warren, D-Ann 
Arbor, to amend S.B. 897.
But perhaps the biggest, 
reddest 
flag 
concerning 
S.B. 897 is the clearly racist 
provision that would exempt 
residents in rural, mostly 
white 
counties 
from 
the 

requirements. The provision 
states 
that 
counties 
with 
unemployment greater than 
8.5 percent would be exempt 
from the work requirements. 
Sounds fine and not-racist, 
right? Well, let us conduct 
a comparison. Lake County 
is in western Michigan and 
is 87 percent white. In this 
county, the unemployment 
rate as of March was 9.2 
percent, 
well 
within 
the 
range for exemption. On 
the other hand, in Detroit, 
which is 80 percent Black, 
unemployed people would 
not be graced with the same 
exemption because Wayne 
County writ large has an 
unemployment rate of only 5 
percent. Same goes for other 
majority-minority cities like 
Flint, Saginaw and Benton 
Harbor. While I do not think 
that this provision to S.B. 
897 was meant to be racist, it 
certainly is.
In summary, S.B. 897 will 
lead to poorer health for 
disadvantaged Michiganders 
who rely on Medicaid with 
particularly harsh impacts 
on seasonal workers, parents 
or guardians of children, and 
urban people of color. It is 
racist and classist.
I understand the need to cut 
down on Medicaid spending 
in Michigan but there are 
better alternatives. It is clear 
from the push for Medicaid 
work requirements and the 
earlier fiasco to repeal the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
that 
Republicans do not believe 
health care is a basic human 
right. It is up to vigilant 
voters to defend the health of 
our fellow Michiganders. S.B. 
897 must be opposed.

‘Tully’ is fresh

Caitlyn Smith discusses 
her music career, album 

FILM REVIEW

“This album 
was the end of 
a long, winding 

road.”

MUSIC INTERVIEW

When the next big thing is in 

front of you, you sit up and take 
notice. That’s the effect Cait-
lyn Smith has on a room: She 
demands your undivided atten-
tion. While she may not be a 
household name yet, her show at 
The Blind Pig on May 3 had the 
distinct feel of a rising star — the 
kind of grungy, small-venue per-
formance you brag about having 
seen a year later when the artist is 
all over the radio.

Smith is already the biggest 

name you’ve never heard in the 
music industry. Her origin story 
fits neatly into the mythology of 
the all-American country singer: 
Raised in a small town in Min-
nesota, Smith started performing 
in the Twin Cities before mov-
ing to Nashville, where she built 
a career as a songwriter. Some 
of her songs were picked up by 
major recording artists, including 
Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton 
(“You Can’t Make Old Friends”), 
Rascal Flatts (“Let it Hurt”), Lady 
Antebellum (“747”), James Bay 
(“Hear Your Heart”) and Meghan 
Trainor and John Legend (“Like 
I’m Gonna Lose You”). Smith 
struggled to establish herself as a 
performer in her own right until 
Starfire, her breakout release this 
January from Monument Records 
for which she is currently touring.

“This album was the end of a 

long, winding road. I went around 
to every label in Nashville and 
tried writing for radio and tried 
writing what I thought other peo-
ple wanted from me. Finally, after 
years of hearing ‘no’ from record 
labels and ‘no’ from most of Nash-
ville, that’s what brought me to 

creating Starfire,” said Smith in a 
phone interview with the Michi-
gan Daily. “I stepped back and I 
thought, you know what, I can 
write songs that are my story and 
not think about genre, not think 
about radio, not think about any-
thing except making music that I 
love.”

The tracks on Starfire tend 

toward 
confessional, 
drawing 

from Smith’s Minnesota roots 
and the hustle of trying to make a 
name for herself in Nashville. For 
Smith, the freedom to be more 
vulnerable and personal in her 
songwriting was an important 
reason for the shift towards per-
forming her own songs: “When 
you go in the room to write for an 
artist or for a specific project, it’s 

a little bit more like work. You’re 
able to dig around in what the art-
ist is thinking, but not necessar-
ily tell your story. You can play a 
character in a room, but it’s not 
as personal. When I’m writing 
for myself I’m digging around my 
own heart and my own story and 
my own truth and trying to write 
that.”

The intimacy of these songs is 

always evocative and occasion-
ally heartbreakingly raw like in 
“This Town Is Killing Me,” a song 
about Smith’s struggles in Nash-
ville with the lyrics, “Nashville, 
you win / Your steel guitars and 
broken hearts have done me in / 
I gave you my soul / I wanted it 

so bad and now I just wanna go 
home / This town is killing me, 
this town is killing me.”

Smith covers a lot of ground in 

Starfire, both in terms of emotion-
al range and genre. As much as 
she can access vulnerability and 
grief, Smith is also able to pump 
out brighter, brassier tracks like 
“Contact High” and “Before You 
Call Me Baby” that wouldn’t be 
out of place on the Top 40 charts. 
While the album holds a country 
backbone, Smith includes pop-
inflected hooks and elements of 
blues and rock, making her style 
difficult to pigeonhole.

Despite this variety, Smith’s 

songs show off her meticulously 
honed instinct for songwriting 
— unsurprising, since she consid-
ers herself “a student of songs” 
and cites singer-songwriters like 
Carole King, Paul Simon and 
Patty Griffin as some of her big-
gest influences. Smith identifies a 
common thread in her work: “All 
the songs have some guts! Even 
on the more fun songs, I still feel 
it from my toes.” With Smith’s 
powerhouse vocals and take-no-
prisoners confidence, it’s easy to 
see how gutsiness could be her 
calling card.

After finishing the Starfire 

tour, Smith will go on the road 
with country legends Faith Hill 
and Tim McGraw, and then with 
Sheryl Crow. She says, “2018 is 
about getting this music out to 
the fans. And then anytime I’m 
in Nashville and have a few days 
off I’ll definitely be writing and 
making some new stuff up for the 
next record.” Whatever that next 
record may be, there’s no denying 
that Caitlyn Smith is on the rise, 
and she’s taking all of us along for 
the ride.

What does modern motherhood 

look like? The spectrum of cinematic 
depictions of what it means to be a 
mother is seemingly endless, ranging 
from lighthearted, surface-level por-
trayals of mothers in “Freaky Friday” 
and “Mean Girls” to far darker depic-
tions of mothers acting ‘un-motherly’ 
in “Carrie” and “Ordinary People.” 
Despite the variation in genre, what 
all these films have in common is that 
their portrayals of moth-
erhood are over-exag-
gerated and unrealistic. 
When it comes to inter-
preting 
motherhood, 

the film world turns to 
using a phony lens rather than show-
ing the grittier and occasionally less-
pleasant truth of the stresses and 
anxieties that mothers actually expe-
rience. Void of unnecessary fluff and 
over-dramatization, Jason Reitman’s 
film “Tully” offers audiences a fresh 
and sobering glimpse into the rarely 
revealed side of modern-day mother-
hood and its overshadowed intersec-
tion with mental health, challenging 
the unfair standards that expect con-
stant stability and overall perfection 
from mothers.

Marlo (Charlize Theron, “Mad 

Max: Fury Road”), a mother of 
two elementary-aged kids and a 
newborn baby, is far beyond her 
breaking point. Life has become 
a merry-go-round, but instead of 
spinning around and around among 
colorful animals and smiling faces, 
Marlo is rotating through the same 
numbing routine that mainly consists 
of changing diapers, breastfeeding 
and prepping microwave dinners. In 
a state of perpetual sleeplessness and 
with minimal aid from her loving 
yet ridiculously unhelpful husband 
Drew, (Ron Livingston, “The Con-
juring”) Marlo is running on empty, 
heading toward a downward mental 
spiral. However, a beacon of light 
shines down when, eager to revive 
his sister’s spirits, Marlo’s wealthy 
brother Craig (Mark Duplass, “Safety 
Not Guaranteed”) offers an unusual 
baby-shower gift: a night nurse.

Desperate for a sliver of R&R, 

Marlo takes her brother up on his 
offer, quickly finding herself face-to-
face with the youthful, enviable and 
illustrious Tully (Mackenzie Davis, 
“Blade Runner 2049”). Despite 
Tully’s initial purpose of simply car-
ing for the baby through the night, 
her late-night house calls gradu-
ally evolve into gossip-filled eve-

nings with Marlo. As the friendship 
between the two women grows, their 
bizarre, almost sister-like chemistry 
strengthens and, invigorated by Tul-
ly’s free-spirit and zest, Marlo slowly 
emerges from her state of emotional 
blankness and depression.

Through her character’s feelings 

of self-doubt, numbness and inner 
and outer exhaustion, Theron bril-
liantly delivers the powerful message 
that motherhood is multifaceted. 
While, in part, it is unconditional 
love, joy and relentless devotion, it 

can also lead to a loss of 
identity and emotional 
deterioration. 
Mar-

lo’s unsweetened and 
uncensored moments as 
a mother create the tone 

of realness that persists throughout 
the movie.

Arguably 
most 
commendable 

about “Tully” is its boldness in tack-
ling the theme of mental health, 
a topic seldom explored in adult 
characters. Throughout the film, as 
audience members, it is clear that 
Marlo is experiencing some form of 
postpartum depression and severe, 
debilitating insomnia. Yet, the other 
characters in the film, Marlo’s hus-
band included, are oblivious to her 
struggles. This oblivion speaks more 
broadly to the manner in which, until 
fairly recently, mental health, espe-
cially postpartum depression, was 
often unacknowledged as legitimate 
or relevant by society. Still today 
there exists a skewed and ancient 
notion that mental health can be 
boxed up and designated to fit a spe-
cific type of person, which simply is 
not true. Through the presentation 
of Marlo, a thirty-something mother 
and a character that viewers would 
not expect to be suffering from 
depression, “Tully” overturns the 
false assumptions that there is a mold 
of any sort for what mental health 
‘should’ look like.

More than anything else, “Tully” 

is a film that aims to enlighten. 
Reitman re-evaluates the notion of 
motherhood from a more human-
istic perspective, tearing down the 
implicit and outdated stereotypical 
standards that expect expert child-
care, relentless positivity and endless 
smiles from mothers. With Mother’s 
Day fast approaching, “Tully” takes 
an unconventional route, exposing 
the reality of motherhood’s tribula-
tions, honoring all mothers by chal-
lenging the illusion of ‘the perfect 
mother’ and beautifully shattering 
the misconception that there is a way 
that mothers are supposed to be.

For a title as open-ended as 

“This is America,” one would 
assume Childish Gambino’s latest 
single would poignantly capture 
the racial tensions of the nation, 
using the Black experience as a 
vessel for artistic expression. For a 
listener completely unaware of the 
clandestinely corny wunderkind 
that is Donald Glover, they would 
perceive him to be a yet another 
(admittedly more melodic) tough-
guy rapper singing self praises 
while lyrically waving the barrel 
of an AK in their faces.

While the artist known as 

Childish Gambino, a masquerade 
slowly thinning to reveal a bristly 
Donald Glover wise beyond his 
years, is far from being a garden-
variety trap rapper, with “This 
is 
America,” 
he 
purposefully 

assumes that costume for the sake 
of flashiness. “I got the plug in 
Oaxaca / they gonna find you like 
blocka” boasts Bino, an NYU grad 
raised middle-class whose stand-
up routines often cycle back to his 
love for nerdy, traditionally white 
interests. Yet his boasting isn’t 
hollow flexing; his claims flow 
naturally because they’ve become 
the 
accepted 
social 
rhetoric. 

It’s the talk of the trap music 
scene, an environment ironically 

glorified by society where a 
violent background is seemingly 
essential, where every Black man 
is a gun-toting gangbanger.

Throughout the song, Donald 

recruits a veritable team of trap 
maestros to bolster this irony. 
BlocBoy JB, 21 Savage and Young 
Thug 
pop 
up 
erratically 
for 

the occasional woo, blaow and 
skrrt, with the latter lending a 
whimsically haunting outro as 
well. These varied ad libs are 
woven frequently into the lyrical 
content, as if Childish Gambino 
aims to elevate something which 
ends up being critically associated 
with lazy, repetitive rapping. 
“This is America” is deceptively 

simple, but through the dichotomy 
of the music (which quivers from 
spirited sing-alongs to booming, 
sparsely instrumented snares), 
a bigoted dichotomy of Black art 
is revealed: If it’s not deemed by 
our predominantly white artistic 
world to be culturally important, 
it’s ignorant. Black artists are 
seldom described as within the 
intermediary space of the critical 
spectrum which white artists can 
freely populate, a place where 
one can be corny or innovative or 
plain without their race labeled as 
a defining characteristic of their 
art.

This titular “America” is one 

where to be Black is to be trending, 
be it for the latest dance craze or 
the latest kid to be shot. The music 
video for the song is a microcosm 
of the world Glover 
lives in. He cavorts 
around a warehouse 
followed 
by 
a 

legion 
of

built on choice. We choose to 
parse Black culture only for 
its shining success stories and 
remain ignorant of the chaotic 
backgrounds from which Black 
artists came, which systematically 
fight to keep them down. We 
choose to handle guns with care 
and disregard the bodies of the 
people they slayed (as represented 
by the gleefully jarring murder

off

Race, 

however, is not a 
choice. The chorus, 
where 
Gambino 

implores the “Black

acknowledged 
values 
of 
our 

society. The illusion of choice 
bestowed upon people of color 
is one-strike-and-you’re-out: To 
be caught “slippin’ up” is to be 
engulfed by America herself.

Billy Joel’s and Elton John’s Face 

to Face tour came to Buffalo, New 
York, in March of 2010, and it was 
the first concert I ever attended. 
Sitting eagerly in the stands of the 
massive, sold-out HSBC Arena, I was 
12 years old and knew the majority 
of the men’s discographies by heart. 
My parents started playing their 
Greatest Hits albums for my sisters 
and I when we were too young to 
understand the lyrics, but old enough 
to commit them to memory. Years 
later, we would learn their songs 
on the piano, each of us assuming 
a different anthem. For Mimi and 
Elizabeth, it was Joel’s “Piano Man” 
and “Miami 2017,” and for myself it 
was John’s “Tiny Dancer.”

The performance itself operated 

around the premise of these two 
legends playing individually and 
then in tandem. Their pianos, which 

would rise out from under the stage, 
faced each other from opposite ends 
where they would banter and play 
duets in response to the adoring 
screams from the audience. As it 
turned out, this would be the final 
rendition of the Face to Face tour, 
which had been recurring since 
1994. Rumors of discontent between 
the artists circulated, but nothing 
was ever confirmed. Joel would later 
sign a contract with Madison Square 
Garden to become their resident 
artist and pretty much stop touring, 
while John, who recently announced 
his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, 
is heading towards retirement, but 
not without playing 300 stadiums 
across the world first.

Here are two gods, both of classic 

rock fame, who are careening 
towards the end of their careers 
in the way typical of our surviving 
rock legends — performing at large 
stadiums to fans who grew up 
treasuring their music, be them Baby 

Boomers or Gen-Xers. It is a popular 
progression of classic rock legends 
these days. Live albums, stadium 
tours and residencies seem to be the 
three distinguishing elements of the 
rock star in the 2000s. Steven Hyden 
points this out in his new book 
“Twilight of the Gods: A Journey 
to the End of Classic Rock,” but also 
adds a caveat to these characteristics: 
Soon, tours like these will no longer 
exist because the legends will all be 
gone. Stadium concerts are unique 
to our rock gods, the ones draped in 
nostalgia for the beat-up leather of 
Cadillacs and drug-addled parties in 
a stranger’s basement. Once men like 
Billy Joel and Bruce 
Springsteen 
and 

Mick Jagger finally 
kick it, what will 
become of classic 
rock?

It is easy to tell 

that “Twilight of the 
Gods” is a response 
to the recent loss of musicians who 
seemed incapable of ever dying 
because, in truth, they never seemed 
human. David Bowie, Prince, Tom 
Petty, Gord Downie and Greg 
Allman — none of these stars ever 
seemed subject to mortality, but 

in the last two years alone, this is a 
reality the music world has had to 
face. But while the subtitle for this 
book suggests that Hyden reaches 
the end of classic rock, whatever 
this may look like, he instead acts 
as a catalyst for what the discussion 
of classic rock will look like once 
all of its icons are gone. For years, 
cultural critics have written and 
reflected on the effect these bands 
and musicians have had, but most of 
these conversations have occurred 
while the members are still alive. 
Now, we face the strange task of 
retrospectively 
considering 
the 

careers of all these artists in a time 

when young listeners 
are 
further 
and 

further 
removed 

from the tenets of 
classic 
rock. 
The 

admiration 
and 

recognition for stars 
like Bowie and Petty 
are there, but it’s 

difficult to truly reckon with their 
deaths when we are so far removed 
from their heyday.

At the start of the book, Hyden 

takes care to differentiate between 
classic rock and classic rock. “Classic 
is a value judgement, whereas classic 

rock denotes a particular era of 
music signified by bands that may 
or may not be shitty.” This sentence 
serves as a foreshadowing for both 
the structure and tone of the book. 
Stylized like a double album, the 
book has four sides which are split 
into songs — or chapters — and 
which follow the trajectory of a 
concept album like The Who’s 
Tommy or Genesis’s The Lamb Lies 
Down on Broadway. A “hero” makes 
his way from birth to death while 
attempting to uncover the meaning 
of life along the way, be this through 
drugs, God or both. Except the hero 
here seems to be Hyden himself, and 
Hyden is just a placeholder for the 
larger category of classic rock fiends 
who were captivated by classic rock 
mythology at a young age with its 
tortured artists and romantic visions 
and who now face its impending end. 
Hyden traces the arcs of our most 
beloved rockstars from Bob Dylan 
to Bruce Springsteen alongside the 
overarching decline of classic rock as 
we move into an increasingly digital 
age.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Thursday, May 10, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

Through the public eye, it’s 

easy to view every aspect of 
Serena Williams’s life as picture-
perfect. She’s not only one of 
the greatest athletes of our 
generation — with 23 Grand Slam 
tennis titles and four Olympic 
gold medals — but she’s also a new 
mom to an adorable eight-month 

old 
daughter 
with 
charming 

husband, and Reddit co-founder, 
Alexis Ohanian. Still, what the 
media so often fails to recognize 
about Williams is the adversity 
she had to overcome to make it to 
the top as a Black female athlete, 
as well as the more personal 
insecurities she continues to face 
about being a “good-enough” 
mother. In a raw look into the 
anxiety and pressures that lurk 
within the greatest tennis player 

in the world, the five-part HBO 
documentary 
series 
“Being 

Serena” lets Williams take the 
reigns and write her own life 
story for a change.

In the first episode of the 

series, titled “Fear,” Williams 
encounters a series of unexpected, 
yet significant challenges. Just 
days before she was set to take 
on her sister, Venus, 
in the final match of 
the 2017 Australian 
Open, Serena had a 
bewildering 
dream 

that she was pregnant. 
Her 
suspicions 

rang true and, after 
receiving clearance to play from 
her doctor, she went on to win 
the title (with Venus joking that it 
wasn’t a fair match because it was 
really two against one).

From then on, the documentary 

showcases 
Williams 
coming 

down off of her good-news high 
and sinking into a deep hole of 
fear. Worries about not being the 
best mother and tennis player 
of all time rise to the forefront 
of Williams’s thoughts. Not to 

mention, Serena stays terrifiedly 
cognizant of the riskiness of 
her future delivery (considering 
her past history with blood 
clots during surgery). All of this 
pressure to be perfect and the 
uncertainty that comes along with 
being a first-time mother appear 
to suck the confidence right out of 
our champion, her vulnerabilities 

manifested 
and 

exposed.

As the camera — 

sometimes intimately 
handled 
by 
her 

husband, 
Alexis 
— 

follows Serena around 
the house, to training 

sessions and, ultimately, into 
the delivery room, we become 
privy 
to 
some 
very 
private 

moments. Even though filmed 
celebrity births are nothing new 
to television, the way in which 
Williams documents the entirety 
of her pregnancy sheds light on 
the not-so-glamorous parts of 
the process. In this way, “Being 
Serena” rarely feels forced or 
manicured as a series and ends up 
playing out more along the lines 

of an upscale home movie.

The 
most 
heartwarming 

instances 
of 
the 
premiere 

episode occur when Serena gets 
up close and personal in a one-
shot frame and provides some 
very conversational video diary 
updates. She vows that she will 
return to tennis even stronger 
after the birth of her daughter, 
using the documentary as a 
source of motivation to re-watch 
down the road. As the credits role 
and no formal director is cited, 
the most remarkable aspect of 
“Being Serena” is revealed — its 
honest, first-hand perspective.

Even without an uber dramatic 

storyline or intense, singular 
moment 
of 
conflict, 
“Being 

Serena” wins in its willingness 
to highlight vulnerability and 
the unpleasant truths associated 
with change. As the episodes go 
on, the documentary will surely 
continue to offer some much-
needed 
reassurance 
to 
those 

feeling isolated by their anxieties 
because in the end, even those 
who seem unstoppable are still 
human.

‘Being Serena’ is a 
look into a full life

SINGLE REVIEW: “STREAKY”

THIRD WORLDS

“Streaky”

Death Grips

Third Worlds

 “Streaky,” released this 
past Saturday, is not standard 
fare from Death Grips. It still 
has all their tells — blipping 
synths, MC Ride’s inexhaust-
ible, commanding voice at 
every volume, anxiety and a 
sense of foreboding but not 
since “Hacker,” from their 
2012 release The Money Store 
has Death Grips sounded so 
pop friendly. There’s a clear 
progression from chorus to 
verse and back to chorus 
again, which seems to be an 
intentional choice rather than 
falling back on simpler com-

positions. In addition, all leit-
motifs are introduced within 
the first minute of the track. 
There’s something comfort-
ing about the shift to a more 

traditional place, but also 
something intensely discon-
certing. “Streaky” possesses 
the sleekness of a Government 

Plates track and the coolness 
of some of the calmer moments 
of Bottomless Pit, but, as 
always, tension and worry 
are boiling underneath. Their 
six albums and other releases 
have proved that the group is 
capable of creating evocative, 
disparate sonic landscapes and 
“Streaky” points to a definite 
turn for Year of the Snitch. 
The predictability and ease of 
“Streaky” might be a sign of 
future restraint —or just a red 
herring.

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

Donald Trump, as 

always, broadcasts his 
political 
affairs 
and 

opinions on Twitter’s 
platform. On April 1, he 
tweeted: “Border Patrol 
Agents are not allowed 
to properly do their job 
at the Border because of 
ridiculous liberal (Dem-
ocrat) laws like Catch & 
Release. Getting more 
dangerous. ‘Caravans’ 
coming. 
Republicans 

must go to Nuclear 
Option to pass tough 
laws NOW. NO MORE 
DACA DEAL!”

Trump’s 
reason-

ing for getting rid of 
DACA is ridiculous. 
He believes that people 
under the age of 31 who 
immigrated to America 
before turning sixteen 
protected under DACA 
since 2012 or, “Dream-
ers”, 
are 
inherently 

criminal and danger-
ous. In fact, he attri-
butes America’s crimes 
and economic problems 
on immigrants, includ-
ing the Dreamers. How-
ever, the Dreamers are 
law-abiding 
residents 

of this country who 
positively contribute to 
the country’s growth. 
These individuals are 
young people who grew 
up in America and have 
attended our schools, 
served in our army and 
have careers. The only 
thing that sets them 
apart from any other 
citizen in America is 
their citizenship status.

The 
government 

has encouraged immi-
grants, 
particularly 

Mexicans, to travel to 
America to assist in 
its economic develop-
ment. DACA is the 
least America can do 
to 
acknowledge 
and 

appreciate 
this 
fact. 

DACA should be kept 
and here’s why.

Mexico and the Unit-

ed States have had a 
relationship for a long 
time. Once the “Mexi-

can Miracle” came to an 
end in the 1970s, Mex-
ico experienced a huge 
recession that contribut-
ed to a decline in wages, 
worsened working con-
ditions and plummeting 
economic 
conditions. 

Due to Mexico’s fail-
ure to provide subse-
quent opportunities for 
families to live in, many 
Mexicans 
migrated, 

illegally, to the United 
States to find work and 
to support their fami-
lies.

What was the cause 

of the decline of the 
Mexican Miracle? What 
or who made Mexico no 
longer internally suffi-
cient?

America. Of course, 

it was America.

American and Mexi-

can ties were renewed 
because of America’s 
need for oil, manufac-
tured goods and labor 
in the early 1940s. This 
alliance harmed many 
Mexicans because it 
took jobs away from 
them. Mexican farm-
ers were replaced with 
commercial 
farmers 

who expedited the pro-
cess of farming through 
hybrid seeds and new 

technologies. Mexico’s 
government also priori-
tized commercial farm-
ers and illegally rented 
Ejido land to agribusi-
ness or private farmers.

Aside from the steal-

ing of property and 
eradication 
of 
jobs, 

America tried to assist 
Mexico by providing 
jobs.

American companies, 

including rail lines, beet 
factories 
and 
manu-

facturing 
companies, 

recruited 
heavily 
in 

Mexico starting in the 
early 1920s. Companies 
and employees saw the 
work done in America 
as temporary. However, 
American 
companies 

began requesting their 
workers to stay longer 
by increasing wages. 
This is when the occur-
rence of long-term stay 
in America truly began. 
It was highly influenced 
by America itself.

As Mexicans began 

to stay in America, the 
economy 
in 
Mexico 

continued to get worse. 
For example, today, the 
pay rate and working 
conditions in Mexico 
are drastically different 
than those in America. 

America pays more and 
provides better working 
conditions than Mexico.

According to Busi-

ness Insider, “Mexi-
co OECD data show 
that Mexican workers 
labored 2,327 hours on 
average during 2014, 
far ahead of the 1,796 
hours worked by Amer-
icans. These workers, 
however, 
were 
only 

paid $12,850 (based on 
purchasing power par-
ity) during the year. 
… Americans earned 
$57,139 during the same 
period.”

America’s 
presence 

in Mexico for recruit-
ment 
and 
dominat-

ing 
production 
has 

left Mexico dependent 
on America. Further-
more, many Mexicans 
have made a home in 
America because of the 
lack of opportunities in 
Mexico.

The 
United 
States 

government 
has 

acknowledged 
these 

facts and has, in some 
ways, tried to protect 
some of the immigrants 
who are merely trying 
to help their families by 
migrating. DACA was 
not the only legislation 

passed to help immi-
grant workers.

The first appearance 

of a support for migrants 
who support the econo-
my was the implementa-
tion of the Immigration 
Reform and Control Act 
of 1986 also known as 
the IRCA. The IRCA 
provided amnesty for 
the previous genera-
tion of unsanctioned 
border-crossers 
com-

prised of undocumented 
immigrants who had 
continuously resided in 
the United States since 
January 1, 1982; penal-
ized the employers of 
unsanctioned 
workers 

and increased funding 
for the United States 
Border Patrol.

The IRCA introduced 

the idea of protecting 
immigrants who posi-
tively contributed to 
society from deporta-
tion. Under this bill, 
immigrants’ 
educa-

tion 
increased, 
pov-

erty rates fell and the 
rate of homeownership 
increased 
drastically. 

Once the immigrants 
were legalized, many 
gained jobs of high 
ranking. 
The 
IRCA 

was a great foundation 

for the creation of the 
DACA legislation.

Former 
President 

Obama’s reasoning for 
developing 
Deferred 

Action for Childhood 
Arrivals (DACA) was to 
lift the fear of deporta-
tion from young people 
who were brought here 
as children so that they 
could continue to con-
tribute to our communi-
ties and our country and 
maybe become citizens 
of the United States. 
Immigrants were con-
sidered for DACA if 
they were under 31 
years old on June 15, 
2012, came to America 
before turning 16 and 
had lived in the coun-
try since June 15, 2007. 
Another 
requirement 

was 
that 
individuals 

must have a high school 
diploma, GED, have 
an honorable discharge 
from the military, or 
must still be in school. 
They could not have a 
criminal record.

The benefit of DACA 

is that it awards tempo-
rary work permits and 
protection from depor-
tation 
to 
childhood 

arrivals. Today, DACA 
serves 
over 
800,000 

people, who are often 
called Dreamers.

The 
thought 
of 

eradicating DACA is 
frightening for many 
American citizens and 
those who classify as 
Dreamers. Trump con-
tinues to talk about the 
disadvantages of DACA 
and insists on repealing 
it. It is time for every-
one to fight this battle 
for DACA. The lives 
of the Dreamers and 
American citizens have 
become intertwined as 
one. Our nation’s cul-
ture, economic growth, 
and 
protection 
have 

been 
supported 
and 

uplifted by the Dream-
ers. To turn our backs 
on people who have 
grown up here and who 
have never harmed the 
country is absurd.

Don’t forget, it was 

America who initiated 
the presence of these 
migrant workers.

Beaubien highlights All-Big Ten selections for ‘M’

In a season where the No. 16 
Michigan softball team (18-3 Big 
Ten, 43-10 overall) reclaimed its 
spot atop the Big Ten standings, 
it’s only natural that the acco-
lades have come pouring in.
Four Wolverines were named 
to All Big-Ten teams Wednes-
day, with freshman left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien — named Big 
Ten Pitcher of the Year and Big 
Ten Freshman of the Year — 
highlighting the slate. She and 
senior first baseman Tera Blanco 
were also unanimous All-Big Ten 
First Team selections. Joining 
them on the first team was junior 
second baseman Faith Canfield, 
while junior catcher Katie Alex-
ander 
garnered 
second-team 
honors.
Additionally, 
Beaubien 
and 
freshman 
shortstop 
Natalia 
Rodriguez made the inaugural 
All-Big Ten Freshman Team, 
while Canfield was recognized 
for her glovework as the second-
base representative on the All-
Big Ten Defensive Team. Senior 
catcher Morgan Swift was Mich-
igan’s Sportmanship Award hon-
oree.
For her work in leading a rela-

tively young team to the top of 
the conference standings, Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins was 
named Big Ten Coach of the Year 
— the 17th time she has received 
this honor.
The Daily breaks down each 
all-conference 
selection 
and 
their best performances in con-
ference play.
Meghan Beaubien
People knew Beaubien was 
going to be good, but they’d be 
forgiven if they didn’t think she 
was going to be this good. No-
hitters, statistical milestones, 
national recognition — Beaubien 
has them all.
Beaubien ranks fifth in the 
country and first in the Big Ten 
with a 0.90 earned-run aver-
age and leads the nation with 32 
wins — including a 16-1 confer-
ence record. She is just the 11th 
pitcher in school history to rack 
up 30+ wins. As if that weren’t 
enough, she also threw three no-
hitters and combined for anoth-
er with freshman right-hander 
Sarah Schaefer.
Due to her eye-popping statis-
tics, Beaubien was also named a 
top-10 finalist for the USA Soft-
ball Collegiate Player of the Year.
Best performance: May 5 vs. 
Ohio State — 5 IP, 1 H, 5 Ks

Though Beaubien threw two 
no-hitters 
against 
conference 
foes in Purdue and Maryland 
and had games where she gar-
nered twice as many strikeouts, 
her start against the Buckeyes 
— her final of the regular sea-
son — was her best because the 
lights were brightest. Against 
one of the toughest offensive 
teams the Wolverines would 
face, Beaubien delivered, making 
Ohio State batters look silly time 
and time again. The lone hit she 
allowed was to Lilli Piper — one 
of the best hitters in the confer-
ence — and Piper was thrown 
out attempting to advance to 
third base with no damage done. 
Michigan would eventually win 
the game, 8-0.
Tera Blanco
After a down season by her 
standards last year, Blanco large-
ly returned to form at the plate 
while also serving as the Wol-
verines’ No. 2 starting pitcher, 
behind Beaubien.
In conference play, she batted 
.438 with an on-base percentage 
of .645 and a slugging percent-
age of .813. She also knocked ten 
home runs — five in conference 
games — and drove in 23 runs. 
Her OBP and RBI marks were 
both second in the Big Ten.

This is the third consecutive 
year that Blanco has been named 
to the All-Big Ten First Team.
Best performance: Mar. 31 vs. 
Purdue — 3-3, 2 HR, 4 RBIs
In the second game of a week-
end series against Purdue, Blan-
co had a game for the ages. She 
reached in all four of her plate 
appearances — garnering three 
hits and a walk — in Michigan’s 
11-1 win. In the fourth inning, 
she hit a home run into the out-
field of Ray Fisher Stadium, and, 
not to be outdone, ended the 
game in the fifth when she blast-
ed another pitch off the camera 
tower in center field for a walk-
off three-run shot.
Faith Canfield
As the Wolverines’ leadoff bat-
ter, Canfield’s job was to set the 
tone for every game and serve as 
a catalyst for the rest of the line-
up. She did just that.
In Big Ten play, Canfield post-
ed a batting average of .417 — just 
behind Blanco for fifth in the 
conference. She also had seven 
doubles, 15 RBI and only one 
strikeout. She also showcased 
her speed with four stolen bases.
Defensively, Canfield posted 
a fielding percentage of 1.000 — 
unusual for a middle infielder — 
and demonstrated her ability to 
make both the routine and flashy 
plays, earning her a spot on the 
All-Defensive Team.
Best performance: May 5 vs. 
Ohio State — 3-4, 2B, SB, 2 RBIs
In one of the most important 
series of the year and against the 
toughest opponents Michigan 
would face in conference play, 
Canfield came through. With the 
Wolverines up 1-0, an RBI single 
and an error by the Buckeyes’ 
right fielder extended Michigan’s 
lead to a more-comfortable 3-0. 
Then, in the bottom of the fifth 
with runners on first and second, 
two outs and the score sitting at 
6-0, Canfield hit a deep double to 
right-center field to score both 
runners and end the game early 
with a run-rule rivalry win.
Katie Alexander
Though her stats weren’t as 
flashy as Blanco’s or Canfield’s, 
Alexander made her presence 
known both at the plate and 
behind it. Not only did the former 
bullpen catcher develop into an 
offensive force, she also caught 
all six of the Wolverines’ no-hit-
ters — a program record — and 
managed the varying personali-

ties of the newcomer Beaubien 
and the veteran Blanco.
Alexander earned her second-
team nod by batting .351 in con-
ference play with 11 RBIs, five 
doubles, two triples and a home 
run and even added a stolen 
base. Defensively, she boasted a 
.994 fielding percentage and Big 
Ten opponents went just three-
for-nine on stolen base attempts 
with Alexander behind the plate.
This is her first all-conference 
nod.
Best performance: Apr. 6 at 
Penn State — 3-4, 2B, 2 RBIs
After an up-and-down start to 
her season, Alexander broke out 
in State College. In Michigan’s 
14-2 run-rule win, Alexander 
had an RBI single in the second, 
a double in the fifth and a two-
out, bases-loaded RBI single in 
the sixth — part of a seven-run 
rally that extended the Wolver-
ines’ lead from five runs to 12 
runs and ended the game early.
Other honorees
Rodriguez — along with Beau-
bien a representative on the 
All-Big Ten Freshman Team 
— didn’t post the eye-popping 
traditional stats of some of her 
teammates, but she made her 
presence known in other ways. 
A vacuum at shortstop, Rodri-
guez showed off her range by 
saving many a would-be hit. She 
posted a .913 fielding percentage 
in conference play. At the plate, 
the slap-hitter punished oppos-
ing defenses with her speed and 
was a perfect three-for-three in 
stolen bases.
Swift, Michigan’s Sportsman-
ship Award winner, served pri-
marily as the bullpen catcher and 
appeared in just four games over 
her career with the Wolverines 
— and only one in 2018. Though 
her lone career at-bat was three 
years ago, Swift is still an impor-
tant veteran leader on the team. 
A stalwart in the classroom as 
well, Swift double-majored in 
business 
administration 
and 
mechanical engineering and was 
named Academic All-Big Ten in 
2016 and 2017.
Hutchins kept her team calm 
through a bad start to non-con-
ference play and led them to an 
18-3 conference record — includ-
ing a 15-game winnings streak. 
Michigan won 37 of its last 41 
games and will once again be the 
top seed in the Big Ten Tourna-
ment.

Salter brothers’ final face off

For as different as the Michigan and 
Michigan State baseball teams are, on 
Wednesday they both had one thing 
in common: a Salter brother squatting 
behind home plate donning the num-
ber 11 on the back of his jersey.
In the non-conference rivalry con-
test, the younger brother Harrison 
and his fellow Wolverines prevailed, as 
Michigan (14-3 Big Ten, 31-14 overall) 
trounced Michigan State (8-9, 17-26) 
10-2.
It’s fitting that a rivalry depicted 
as the squabbling between siblings 
has now featured a legitimate battle 
between brothers.
It was clear that this game would be 
special for the Salter family from the 
beginning. During the second inning, 
Will Salter stepped up to the plate 
where his younger brother Harrison 
was waiting for him.
Sitting a mere inches from his broth-
er, Harrison anxiously awaited to see 
how his brother would perform under 
the unique circumstances. Not want-
ing to disappoint, the senior knocked 
a single to left field to load the bases. 
After a forceout and strikeout ended 
the inning, it was the redshirt fresh-
man’s turn.
Not to be outdone, Harrison 
knocked an RBI single also to left field 
to match his brother hit-for-hit and 
give the Wolverines the lead.
But the fraternal competition would 
not stop there.
In the bottom half of that same 
inning, Will would get another chance 
to show his brother who was boss.
Will then legged out an infield single 
which was hit to third base for his sec-
ond hit of the day.
After the Wolverines regained the 
lead in the fourth inning, Harrison and 

co. entered the fifth wanting to extend 
that lead and show his brother up. The 
younger Salter would do just that, clob-
bering his first career home run deep 
over the right field fence again with his 
brother within spitting distance.
“I haven’t hit a homerun since I was 
12 years old,” Salter said, “but the past 
couple weeks I’ve been working with 
the coaching staff on getting balls to 
drive and stuff like that. Luckily I got 
that pitch to drive. It was kinda a blur 
for me walking around the bases, but it 
was a really cool experience.
“I’ll probably hold on to that forever.”
Wanting to add further to his career 
day, Salter then slapped another RBI 
single up the middle extending Michi-
gan’s lead even further to 6-2.
This would mark the end of the 
Salter family’s fruitful day at the plate. 
Ending with a combined five hits and 
a lot of brotherly love, this contest will 
surely be one the boys will remember.
“It was a little weird at first because 
he’s always been my best friend, always 
been on my side,” the younger Salter 
said. “He’s definitely my role model, my 
older brothers are my role models, so 
it’s definitely a cool experience to defi-
nitely compete with him, but I got over 
it now and it’s a great feeling.”
Besides sharing a field together, the 
brothers also share a number — 11.
The number was worn by their 
grandfather, legendary catcher Bill 
Freehan and is even retired at Ray 
Fisher stadium in Ann Arbor. Harri-
son was granted special permission to 
wear the number in honor of his grand-
father.
“When you can assign deeper pur-
pose and deeper meaning to wearing 
a number and playing for a school, 
that’s how you get some magical per-
formances,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “And for he and his brother 
Will and his brother Blaze, they have 

been so strongly influenced by one of 
the legends of the game in their grand-
father Bill Freehan, so it means an 
awful lot to wear number 11 for him… 
so he’s a totally selfless kid and it just 
means so much for him to play for 
Michigan and wear the block-M and 
to be at a school that his grandfather 
played at and coached at.
“There’s not a person on the field or 
in the stands that isn’t happy for those 
types of moments.”
Also contributing to the Wolverines’ 
big day was freshman left fielder Jor-
dan Nwogu.
The first-year had two momentous 
plays that added crucial insurance runs 
deep into the game.
The first came from an extremely 
rare inside-the-park home run off a 
ball clobbered to center field. After 
flying out to center field earlier in the 
game, Nwogu found better luck in the 
seventh inning, as he turned on the jets 
and rapidly slid into home plate.
“At first, I thought it was a line drive 
to center field because at my first at-bat 
I hit a very similar hit and he caught it, 
so I was discouraged a bit because I saw 
it went right to him, but then I saw him 
dive for it and immediately I turned on 
the burners,” Nwogu said. “It was just 
exhilarating. I ran as fast as I could, and 
it just felt like little league.”
Then, to follow up with the astound-
ing play, Nwogu cranked an absolute 
moonshot over the left field wall for 
perhaps the team’s farthest home run 
of the year. The solo shot marked the 
team’s 10th run and the last of Michi-
gan’s dominant performance.
For a game between conference 
opponents but without conference 
standings consequences, the dramat-
ics surely were not lacking. Despite 
the outcome, this was a game that 
both programs — and brothers — will 
remember forever.

Wolverines victorious 
over Central Michigan

Whether it wanted to or not, the 
Michigan baseball team has faced its 
last non-conference opponent.
On Tuesday, the Wolverines (14-3 
Big Ten, 30-14 overall) trounced 
Central 
Michigan 
(12-9 
Mid-
American, 20-26-1) 9-2 in the kind 
of play that one expects from a 
program gearing up for its conference 
tournament on the horizon.
While it eagerly awaits its shot at 
glory in the remainder of conference 
play, Michigan has had a love-hate 
relationship with its non-conference 
schedule, officially ending it with 
a 
non-conference 
game 
against 
Michigan State on Wednesday.
Perhaps legendary rock group Led 
Zeppelin best characterizes the testy 
relationship in its smash-hit, “Good 
Times Bad Times.”
Good times bad times you know I 
had my share
Throughout 
the 
long 
season, 
the Wolverines suffered crushing 
defeats, been on the wrong side of 
walk-off hits and were dealt blistering 
losing streaks while also surging to 
walk-off wins, glorious victories and 
uplifting win streaks all against non-
conference opponents.
In the days of my youth, I was told 
what it means to be a man
And now I’ve reached that age, I’ve 
tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way 
into the same old jam
Starting 
the 
season 
with 
a 
demoralizing 4-11 record, Michigan 
was crushed by non-conference foes. 
No matter how incessantly Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich reminded his 
players of the fundamentals of 
Wolverine baseball, nothing seemed 
to be working. Michigan knew what it 
meant to be a man but couldn’t escape 
the pangs of rebuilding.
Then, after returning from a 
bruising west coast road trip, the 
Wolverines turned it around and 
began their famed 20-game win 
streak against yet another non-
conference opponent: Bowling Green.
Then, sixteen, I fell in love with a girl 
as sweet as could be
Since then, it’s been nothing but 
blue skies against non-conference 
combatants, as Michigan failed to lose 
a game against them. The Wolverines 
fell in love with winning and couldn’t 
seem to quit it.
The driving factor behind their 

success can largely be attributed to 
mentality. In its successes this season, 
Michigan has consistently stayed on 
the offensive, letting the bats fly early 
and often while being buttressed by 
stout pitching and solid defense.
These positives were on full display 
against the Chippewas as three 
different Wolverines notched three-
hit games and on seven separate 
occasions, Michigan put its leadoff 
hitter on base.
“That’s the most leadoff hitters 
that we’ve had reach base that I can 
certainly remember this season and 
in quite some time,” Bakich said. “It’s 
something you strive to do. We have 
a goal to always try to hit the leadoff 
hitter on most innings, but it was an 
advantage today. We were able to get 
guys in motion and keep pressure on 
‘em and score in multiple innings, so 
just a good job by the offense of being 
locked-in and ready to go.”
In a separate demonstration of 
the team’s locked-in mental state, 
the Wolverines suffocated Central 
Michigan with a three run ninth 
inning while already being up 6-1.
“They understand how valuable 
those runs are and how fresh in 
everybody’s mind was the beginning 
we gave up at Rutgers on Friday,” 
Bakich said. “So a 6-1 lead is a good 
lead, but it’s not enough. Credit to the 
guys for wanting to expand that lead 
and put that pressure on ‘em and keep 
competing in the box and not throw 
any at-bats away.”
One player who surely did not 
squander 
any 
opportunity 
on 
Tuesday was junior second baseman 
Ako Thomas. Thomas went three-
for-five from the plate after missing 
the previous weekend’s contests due 
to injury.
Thomas 
and 
his 
teammates 
completed the dominant win despite 
not playing at home — the final 
piece of Michigan’s non-conference 
success.
I sure do wish I was at home
Over the season, the Wolverines 
are an astounding 17-1 at home and 
undefeated against non-Big Ten foes 
at Ray Fisher stadium.
Therefore, it’s fitting that Led 
Zeppelin’s ballad concludes with a 
touching sentiment that can also be 
applied to Michigan’s affinity for the 
turf field in Ann Arbor.
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realise, sweet babe, we ain’t ever 
gonna be apart.

Wolverines find glory on Senior Day against rival OSU

Life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness.
The essence of the American 
dream is chasing those ideals as well 
creating success and opportunity 
through hard work and dedication. 
So for the Wolverines, they were liv-
ing the dream.
On Saturday’s matchup against 
Ohio State, the No. 14 Michigan soft-
ball team celebrated its senior day 
with a 8-0 win in six innings. After a 
blunder-filled game Friday, the Wol-
verines eased their doubts by fixing 
all the the wrong things and keeping 
all the right.
“You always want to beat Ohio 
State, especially on Senior Week-
end,” said senior designated player 
Taylor Swearingen. “It’s the cherry 
on top. And winning the Big Ten 
Championship, it’s like a dream 
come true right now.”
However, a rivalry win, a domi-
nant display and a Big Ten title don’t 
just fall from the sky. None of those 
things came easy. And as early as the 
opening inning, that was evident.
After creating some momentum 
with a quick three-up-three-down 
inning at the top of the first, the team 
saw its offensive struggles return 
with three outs on four at-bats — 
including two groundouts and a 
pop out. With the three outs com-
ing in rapid succession, silence was 
ushered throughout the crowd and 
dugout.
A 
positive 
that 
came 
from 
the inning was second baseman 
Faith Canfield returning to form. 
The senior hit a single to left field 
attempting to find a groove to offset 
her recent batting struggles. Canfield 
then additionally came away with a 
steal — upping her confidence.
However, it would take more than 
just a single and a steal to rile up the 
dwindling spirits around Alumni 

Fields.
Another three-and-out top of the 
inning brought some noise around 
the stadium but it still teetered 
between the edge of snoozing and 
erupting — just looking for the extra 
push to tip the balance.
Then it came at the bottom of the 
second inning.
With bases loaded, sophomore 
outfielder Haley Hoogenraad broke 
open the scoring — and the silence 
— with a fielder’s choice play that 
brought the stadium back to life.
The run was set up by junior 
catcher Katie Alexander’s walk. 
Senior outfielder Aidan Falk drove a 
fly ball down centerfield that enabled 
them to advance a base before being 
joined by Swearingen to load the 
bases. Swearingen’s patience at the 
plate allowed her to fight back from 
a 0-2 count to eventually get the free 
base by walk.
“Hitting the ball out of the infield,” 
said Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“You know our first run kind of came 
on kind of a blue pit, and don’t get me 
wrong, those are great because we’re 
swinging.
“And you know, our whole group 
broke through a bit because I saw 
more, I mean, Aidan had a well-hit 
ball.So we’re just trying to score runs 
and it was really big to get out and get 
a lot of runs. We really needed that.”
The exuberance in the dugout and 
in the stands showed just how much 
it was needed. After Friday’s game, 
where runs came at a premium, the 
early signs of a potent offense was 
much appreciated. And it didn’t end 
with one run.
Freshman 
Natalia 
Rodriguez 
hit a line drive to second base that 
advanced everyone but Hoogenraad 
who was subsequently tagged out on 
her way to second. With runners on 
the corners, Canfield looked prime 
to inject even more life back into the 
stadium. Hitting a single down right 
field, she sprinted to first, pleased to 

expand the lead even if it was just by 
one. But a mishandle by the Buckeye 
outfielder allowed Canfield to con-
tinue on her path and end at third — a 
two-RBI hit.
From that point on, the Wolver-
ines had all the freedom at the plate 
as they wanted.
Junior outfielder Natalie Peters 
stood firm at the plate, waiting for 
her pitch. But it never came. She 
watched three go by without biting 
on any for a 3-0 count. The next pitch 
she chose to swing, but she had the 
liberty to do so even though it result-
ed in a strike. The pressure wasn’t on 
her. It was on the Ohio State pitcher 
who was facing a runner in scoring 
position with a three-ball count dur-
ing the at-bat.
What was the result? Peters was 
walked in the next pitch — restrain-
ing her swing on the high ball.
Senior first baseman Tera Blanco 
followed suit during the very next at-
bat. Sensing the thin ice the pitcher 
was walking on, she took a chance on 
the off-speed pitch but was called for 
a strike. However, the liberty at the 
plate came to her just as it had Peters. 
Four consecutive balls came, and 
she made her way to first for loaded 
bases. Now in an defensive free fall, 
the Buckeyes changed pitcher in 
hopes of a more promising outcome.
But it was the same story for the 
Wolverines. Sophomore third base-
man Madison Uden knew the strike 
zone and waited for the pitch to 
enter. Instead, she came out of her at-
bat seeing four straight balls, upping 
the lead by one.
“Yeah, I think we were just try-
ing to command our zone a little bit 
better today,” Swearingen said. “And 
that actually helped us, and I mean, 
we took advantage of the free bases, 
and we got timely hits that way.”
Ohio State stopped the bleeding 
with a strikeout on Alexander to end 
the inning and close a threatening 
situation.

Whereas the Michigan batters 
had liberties at the plate, the Buckeye 
batters had none.
Another three-up three-down 
inning forced Ohio State off the field 
and gave the Wolverines an ample 
opportunity to widen the gap. It was 
all part of the game plan.
“I think more than anything with 
our offense, you look at up at (Michi-
gan State) the other day, we ended up 
with eight runs,” Hutchins said. “We 
kind of chipped away every inning. 
And taking walks was huge. We took 
a lot of bases. And if they’re going to 
give us bases, we need to take them. 
We need to not be walking back to 
the dugout after ball four.”
While in many situations, a walk 
or two can be made up for with stel-
lar defense. But with the unforgiving 
lineup for Michigan, every mistake 
matters. So when Swearingen was 
once again walked — another four-
pitch walk — Hoogenraad promptly 
capitalized. With knees bent and 
stance tightened, she hit a no-doubt 
home run into the branches of the 
trees behind left field.
“I don’t know if anything I saw 
to any of them really matters,” 
Hutchins said, “but I said I’d like 
them to swing more like Haley 
Hoogenraad, because Haley’s got a 
big ole swing.”
The Wolverines ended the inning 
after two outs by Rodriguez and 
Canfield on a bunt attempt and a 
groundout, but the team did its dam-
age.
Pushing for a response, the Buck-
eyes failed to deliver — though giv-
ing a viable scare at the top of the 
4th. After a groundout by the leadoff 
batter, Ohio States’ Lilli Piper — their 
most potent offensive player who 
had hit a home run the game prior — 
hit a double down line in left field. A 
fielder’s choice sent her to third, and 
hope emerged that the team could 
put one on the board. But Uden put 
the crowd at ease with a groundout.

It wasn’t until a full inning later 
did another scoring chance emerge, 
but this time, for Michigan. Swear-
ingen saw another free base as she 
was walked through four pitches at 
the bottom of the fifth. Sophomore 
designated player Abby Skvarce — 
substituting for Rodriguez — was hit 
by pitch before being replaced at first 
back by Rodriguez.
The spotlight fell to Canfield to 
put an early end to the game. After 
three balls and a foul for a count in 
her favor, the junior saw Hutchins 
urge her on to swing hard.
“She hit the ball way better today,” 
Hutchins said. “She did. She swung 
harder. She swung through it. I said 
you can’t be afraid to miss. It’s ok if 
you miss. I’d rather have you swing 
well and miss than just make contact 
and be out.”
Getting full contact on the swing, 
the ball was sent down centerfield 
and to the wall. The runners made 
a mad dash to home where Swearin-
gen easily saw home plate. However, 
Rodriguez froze at third despite fur-
ther urgings by Hutchins to contin-
ue. The moment of hesitation looked 
costly, as Rodriguez bit the bullet and 
made her way to home plate even 
though the catcher looked prime to 
garner the ball in time. But with her 
speed, the freshman hustled near the 
batter’s box before diving to the dirt 
— her hand safely on the plate just as 
the catcher bent over to tag.
It was ironic. The freshman tag-
ging home to secure the seniors a Big 
Ten championship on their senior 
day, effectively accepting the torch 
being passed down. In a rush of hap-
piness, the dugout emptied, as the 
players inundated the field to accept 
their title.
This was supposed to be just a 
stop in the long race. After all, the 
Wolverines have their eyes on the 
finish line — a College World Series 
title — but in the moment, they were 
living the dream.
