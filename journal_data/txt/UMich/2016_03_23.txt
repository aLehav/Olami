By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Sticking to his original 

platform 
of 
improving 

basic services and quality 
of life in Ann Arbor, Mayor 
Christopher Taylor (D–Ann 
Arbor) formally kicked off 
his re-election campaign at 
a fundraising party in the 
Arbor

Company 

Tuesday. This is his second 
time 
running 
for 
mayor, 

but 
first 
time 
doing

The Social Work and Education 

Collaboration, 
a 
new 
student 

organization based out of the 
School 
of 
Social 
Work 
and 

the School of Education at the 
University of Michigan, held a 
panel event Tuesday featuring 

educators from the Detroit Public 
Schools system.

During the event, panelists 

discussed what they considered 
misconceptions 
about 
Detroit 

Public 
Schools, 
such 
as 

deteriorating infrastructure, and 
emphasized how the controversy 
surrounding DPS impacts students 
and the school environment. 

Kaili McGrath, a Social Work 

graduate student and one of the 
coordinators of the event, said 
she found members of SWEC 
wanted to learn more about DPS. 
SWEC focuses on bridging service 
gaps in education and bridging 

interdisciplinary 
professional 

learning communities, according 
to their website.

“When we first started our 

organization, we asked if there 
was one thing you would want to 
learn more about what would it be, 
and the answer was Detroit Public 
Schools,” she said.

During the event, Marnina

From THE MICHIGAN DAILY

This 
Central 
Student 

Government 
election 
season 

has brought new debate to the 
often-discussed issues of mental 
health, diversity and inclusion 
and student voice. All three 
CSG parties — Your Michigan, 
the Defend Affirmative Action 
Party and newMICH — have 
commendable 
platforms 
that 

seek to address these issues using 
a multitude of means. However, 
newMICH’s 
specific 
plans 

for the most important issues 
facing campus today stand out 
among the three. LSA junoors 
David 
Schafer 
and 
Micah 

Griggs, running for president 
and vice president respectively 
on the newMICH ticket, are 
experienced, 
socially 
aware 

students, with detailed plans 
to improve CSG. The Michigan 
Daily’s Editorial Board endorses 
the newMICH candidates in this 
year’s CSG elections.

The 
four 
core 
tenets 
of 

newMICH’s platform — student 
voice, connection, well-being 
and safety and opportunity 
— 
outline 
their 
plans 
to 

implement change. Though their 
platform is ambitious, Schafer’s 
experience as a student assistant 
with the Office of Academic 
Multicultural 
Initiatives 
and 

Griggs’ 
experience 
working 

with the Black Student Union 
and as an Intergroup Relations 
facilitator shows their ability 
to work with groups dedicated 
to 
diversity 
and 
inclusion. 

This experience and their time 
working as LSA representatives 
in 
CSG 
demonstrate 
firstly 

that they are committed to 
these issues. Secondly, it shows 
 

that they have worked with 
administrators through these 
groups to accomplish goals like 
increasing minority enrollment, 
establishing 
international 

student mentorship programs 
and requiring CSG members to 
complete Integroup Relations 
training. However, many of 
their plans hinge on the crucial 
approval, and subsequent funds 
of the University’s Board of 
Regents. 

The Board of Regents is 

empowered by the state of 
Michigan’s 
constitution

Revisions aim to 
clarify enforced 

definition of 

consent, harassment 

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter 

The University of Michigan 

announced an updated policy 
on sexual misconduct Tuesday, 
including 
changes 
to 
the 

enforced definition of consent, an 
expansion of what is considered 

prohibited 
conduct 
and 
the 

consolidation 
of 
sanctioning 

and appeals procedures. The 
amendments will be effective 
July 1.

The new policy, renamed the 

University of Michigan Policy and 
Procedures on Student Sexual 
and Gender-based Misconduct 
and Other Forms of Interpersonal 
Violence instead of the Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy, will be 
officially updated and available to 
the public on April 6. A draft of 
the updated policy was released 
in September 2015. The policy 
was last revised in 2013.

The 
revisions 
expand 
the 

policy’s scope to include gender-
based harassment — violence 
suffered due to gender identity, 
sexuality 
and 
orientation 

— 
and 
intimate 
partner 

violence in addition to sexual 
harassment and sexual assault. 
Stalking, which was originally 
encompassed under the label of 
sexual harassment, will now be 
addressed as its own category.

Holly 
Rider-Milkovich, 

director of the Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center, said in a joint interview 
Tuesday 
with 
University 

President Mark Schlissel and Title 
IX Coordinator Anthony Walesby 
that the expansions ensure the 
University’s 
compliance 
with 

federal guidelines.

“It aligns with the Clery Act 

and Title IX concerns,” she said. 
“We want these behaviors that 
students sometimes experience 
concurrently to fall under the 
same policy.”

The University is currently 

under 
investigation 
by 
the 

Department of Education’s Office 
of Civil Rights, which enforces 
Title IX, over its handling of 

newMICH party 
platform includes 
adding member to 
‘U’ governing body

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

A central component of one 

of this year’s Central Student 
Government platforms might 
require changes to either the 
state’s 
constitution 
or 
the 

University of Michigan’s Board 
of Regents’ bylaws — which 
has raised questions among 
students and other candidates 
for CSG executive offices on 
the feasibility of their plans 
given 
the 
legal 
strictures 

surrounding the board.

The 
component, 
from 

newMICH’s platform, calls for 
the addition of a student to the 
Board of Regents. LSA junior 
David 
Schafer, 
newMICH 

presidential 
candidate, 

emphasized the platform point 
in an interview on February 11. 
 

“We’re 
very 
proud 
that 

newMICH is the only party 
that calls for student presence 
on the Board of Regents, either 
in a voting or non-voting 
capacity,” Schafer said.

When they declared their 

candidacy 
in 
February, 

newMICH cited the progress 
of 
campus 
initiatives 
in 

colleges 
similar 
to 
the 

University, noting that some 
had succeeded in placing a 
student on their equivalent of 
a Board of Regents in a non-
voting capacity.

LSA junior Micah Griggs, 

newMICH’s vice-presidential 
candidate, said in a February 
interview having a student 
sit on the board with a voting 
capacity would be ideal, but 
the overall goal is to amplify 
the students’ voice. She said a 
non-voting member would still 
play a large role in supporting 
issues pertinent to the well-
being of students, such as the 
University’s Counseling and 
Psychological 
Services 
and 

Sexual Assault Prevention and

KRISTINA PERKINS/Daily

Angela Davis, activist and recipient of UM Flint’s Winegarden 
Visiting Professorship, addressed intersectional feminism at 
the Riverfront Banquet Center in Flint, Michigan on Tuesday.

ACTIVISM OF DAVIS 

A petition authored 

by Wolverines for 
Preferred Pronouns 
urging the University 
of Michigan to allow 
students to indicate 
their preferred pronoun 
to professors is gaining 
traction. The month-
old online letter, 
addressed to University 
Provost Martha Pollack 
and Kedra Ishop, 
associate vice president 
for enrollment 
management, 
gained more than 50 
supporters today.

“Currently, students 

must reach out to their 
professors and GSIs 
on their own or risk 
being misgendered in 
the classroom,” the 
petition reads. “This 

can be a mentally 
and emotionally 
draining experience 
for individuals who 
constantly have to 
inform or correct their 
professors of their 
identity.”

The petition advises 

a space for students to 
fill out their pronoun — 
male, female or gender-
neutral — on Wolverine 
Access, and that faculty 
and staff be notified of 
the student’s preference 
on class rosters.

“Knowing the 

pronouns of one’s 
students is especially 
important in small 
lectures, discussion 
sessions, and 
language classes that 
focus on classroom 

conversation,” the 
petition reads.

Authors also invoke 

precedent at other 
universities around the 
country nothing that 
institutions including 
Harvard University 
and the University 
of California system 
provide ways for 
students to indicate 
their pronoun of 
choice when applying. 
The University 
garnered similar 
attention in 2010 when 
student government 
passed a resolution 
eliminating gender-
specific pronouns 
from the Statement 
of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities.

 CSG discusses 

resolution to amend 

current election 

procedures

By MEHRUNISA KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Included 
in 
this 
week’s 

Central Student Government 
positions 
is 
a 
student 

representative 
seat 
on 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Police Department Oversight 
Committee, run through the 
University’s Human Resources 
Department and responsible 
for monitoring the University’s 
police response to disturbances 
on campus.

The 
creation 
of 
the 

committee is mandated by state 
law, adhering to Act 120 of the 
Public Acts of 1990 of the State 
of Michigan. The committee 

considers 
complaints 

against 
the 
University’s 

police department, and also 
recommends 
changes 
and 

disciplinary measuring to the 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security.

It is made up of six members: 

two students, one of which 
will be voted in this week, as 
well as two faculty members 
and two staff members. The 
other student position will be 
filled in the next CSG election. 
The current student positions 
are held by Business senior 
Jacob Glinke, who is rotating 
off after this election, and LSA 
sophomore 
Lisa 
Pomerantz. 

Students 
hold 
ex-officio 

positions, and cannot vote — 
they run for one year-long term 
on the committee, as opposed 
to faculty and staff, which both 
run for two terms.

Two candidates are running 

for this seat, one from Your 
Michigan 
and 
one 
from 

newMICH — though this may 
be the last year that candidates 
have affiliation with parties. 
Public Policy sophomore Jacob 
Pearlman, CSG Student General 
Counsel, put forth a resolution 
the the assembly at Tuesday’s 
CSG meeting clarifying that for 
next year’s election, candidates 
will have to run independant 
of a party. If passed, this 
resolution would ban future 
candidates from attaching to a 
CSG platform.

LSA 
sophomore 
Olivia 

Furano, 
the 
newMICH 

candidate for the role, said she 
thought the seat allows students 
to have more communication 
with 
DPSS 
to 
clear 
any 

confusion 
about 
on-campus 

rules regarding issues such 
as alcohol, drugs and sexual 
misconduct.

“I think that the committee is 

important,” she said “Especially 
for first-year students, there’s 
a lot of confusion about the 
difference between University 
of Michigan rules and Ann 
Arbor police rules. There’s a

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

Two University of Michigan 

Art & Design graduates are 
working to bring a unique 
touch to sign-making in the 
Motor City.

Jordan Zielke and Kelly 

Golden graduated from Stamps 
School of Art & Design in 
2009 and 2010 respectively, 
and shortly after launched 
the Golden Sign Company, 
which provides hand-painted 
signs for business throughout 
Detroit.

Golden Sign Co. has painted 

several prominent signs for 
Detroit businesses including 
Bobcat Bonnie’s in Corktown 
and Carhartt’s flagship store 
in Midtown, which is the 
company’s largest project to 
date, standing at three stories 

tall and more than 200 feet 
long.

Zielke said he and Golden 

became interested in utilizing 
their experiences learning art 
at the University toward sign-
making after reading Sign 
Painters, as well as watching 
the film adaptation, which 
explores the re-emerging hand 
painted sign-making industry.

The first painter examined 

in the book is Doc Guthrie, 
whose 
work 
Zielke 
said 

influenced him, along with 
Golden, to move to Los Angeles 
and train directly under him 
at the Los Angeles Trade 
Technical College.

“We were reading that and 

were like, ‘This is where we 
gotta go,’ ” Zielke said. “It just 
kind of clicked in my head 
that if we were going to do it, 
the best, fastest way to get 
there would be to go to this 
program.”

After completing a year 

of 
the 
two-year 
program, 

Zielke and Golden launched 
the Golden Sign Co. in 2014, 
centering their operation in 
the metro Detroit area.

Golden said they decided to 

move to Detroit because the 
city had earned a reputation 
for its emerging art scene.

“It was discovered as this 

place 
of 
opportunity 
for 

artists,” Golden said. “A lot of 
young people started moving 
from the suburbs and pursuing 
all sorts of different things — 
opening their own businesses 
or any number of things, but 
trying to contribute and help 
Detroit in any way they could.”

Zielke and Golden noted 

that 
while 
the 
increased 

gentrification 
of 
Detroit 

neighborhoods 
has 
created 

past tensions between current 
residents and newcomers, they 
said they have only had positive 
experiences with their work 
in the city and said Detroiters 
have been welcoming.

One of Golden Sign Co.’s 

projects was commissioned in 
the city’s East English Village 
neighborhood, 
an 
area 
of 

Detroit that hasn’t seen the 
same investment and business 
growth as other neighborhoods 
like Midtown, Corktown and 
Downtown.

several sexual misconduct cases.

Walesby 
noted 
that 
the 

expansion of categories may 
affect the Office of Institutional 
Equity’s 
ability 
to 
conduct 

both a timely and thorough 
investigation. Both the new and 
current versions of the policy 
limit the investigation process 
to 60 days, a time period chosen 
to balance considering as much 
information as possible with 
timeliness, according to Walesby.

“It could affect case time, but 

we also want to make sure we’re 
getting the full picture,” he said.

The revision will also refine 

definitions of consent in regard 
to incapacitation and coercion. A 
Michigan Daily report last year 
found inconsistencies between 
SAPAC’s definition of consent 
and the definition of consent 
enforced in the University’s 
policy. Rider-Milkovich said the 
extended specifications are an 
attempt to address any ambiguity 
of consent when students are 
under the influence of alcohol.

“I think that we did not do 

a good enough job at defining 
incapacitation the first time 
around … We make clear to 
students 
that 
incapacitation 

is a state greater than mere 

intoxication,” she said. “And we 
provide other kinds of guidance. 
We tell students the best thing to 
do if one or both parties has been 
consuming alcohol is to forgo 
sexual activity.” 

In terms of the restructuring 

of the sanctioning and appeals 
process, Rider-Milkovich said 
it was aimed at improving the 
efficiency of the process. A new 
sanctioning board — made up of 
appointees from Central Student 
Government, the Office of the 
President and the Office of the 
Vice President for Student Life — 
will be charged with reviewing 
cases in which an individual 
has been found responsible for 
misconduct 
and 
determining 

the consequences of the finding. 
The Office of Student Conflict 
Resolution, 
which 
currently 

facilitates 
sanctions 
through 

a Resolution Coordinator or a 
resolution process, will have no 
official role in the revised policy.

Though 
students 
voiced 

concerns 
during 
roundtable 

talks about whether a CSG 
appointee on the board would be 
the best way to be representative 
of the student body, University 
President Mark Schlissel said 
in an interview Tuesday that 
pursuing other means of naming 
a student would threaten the 
integrity and efficiency of the 
process.

“You could imagine another 

extreme where you want to be 
as representative as possible, 
and you’ve got 20 people on a 
sanctioning board,” he said. 
“Confidentiality is very difficult. 
Arriving at a decision is very 
challenging; timeliness is harder 
... We’re trying to balance lots of 
things.” 

As well, instead of appeals 

being reviewed by an internal 
board as the current policy 
mandates, the new policy will 
rely on an external reviewer to 
assess findings and sanctions if 
the respondent or complainant 
chooses to appeal an outcome. 
Though no one has been chosen 
to fill the position yet, Schlissel 
said the third party will most 
likely be an attorney, and must 
be an impartial expert on sexual 
misconduct and the law.

The reports generated during 

investigations will also see a 
change under the new policy, 
which states that they must reveal 
the identities of all witnesses to 
both parties. Schlissel said the 
naming of witnesses will ensure 
fairness to both parties.

Other modifications to the 

policy include clearly identifying 
employees 
responsible 
for 

sharing information on sexual 
misconduct with the University, 
providing further detail on how 
the University shares information 

with 
law 
enforcement 

and 
changing 
the 
label 
of 

“complainant” to “claimant.”

Schlissel 
and 
Rider-

Milkovich 
acknowledged 
the 

administration faces a significant 
hurdle 
in 
ensuring 
students 

are aware of the changes to the 
policy. A campus climate survey 
conducted last fall found that 
though roughly 86 percent of all 
students know the University 
has a Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy, only 55 percent of students 
reported receiving training or 
attending programs on sexual 
assault prevention and reporting.

Schlissel 
said 
the 
new 

policy 
was 
formed 
through 

consulting and guidance from 
the Department of Education’s 
OCR and outside experts, as well 
as internal conversations with 
students and other community 
members. Initially slated to be 
ready before the Winter 2016 
semester, 
conversations 
with 

students, looking at policies at 
other schools and reviewing 
government materials delayed 
the process.

Overall, Schlissel said he hopes 

the revisions will boost student 
engagement and reporting. 

“This might make people more 

likely to come forward ... and we 
hope that’s the case,” he said.

issue.

“These vacancies lead to things 

like overcrowded classrooms or 
long-term subs who are covering 
the class all year because they can’t 
find a teacher,” she said.

Kim Travis-Ewing, a DPS school 

social worker since 1991 and the 
chapter chair for SSW for DFT, 
echoed Falk’s concerns about DPS 
staffing.

“Representing the school, social 

workers have been a task because 
we used to have over 300 and now 
we are probably down to about 100,” 
said Travis-Ewing. “They’re also 
leaving in high numbers because 
of the financial conditions, the 
buildings, and how we’re being 
treated as employees.”

The 
panel 
members 

also 
discussed 
some 
of 
the 

misconceptions and ignored issues 
that surround DPS, which they said 
were largely due to the media.

Kaity Nicastri, the community 

school site coordinator at Bennett 
Elementary, said she thought one 
common misconception was who 
the right people are to handle 
Detroit’s education systems.

“I think a misconception that 

I’ve noticed and that seems to 
be persistent is that a business 
perspective works in educational 
systems,” said Nicastri. “I think that 
is something that is not really talked 
about in the media.”

However, 
among 
discussion 

of problems, speakers also noted 
several positive aspects of DPS.

Steve 
Ezikian, 
the 
deputy 

superintendent of Wayne County 
Regional 
Educational 
Service 

Agency, said helping children in DPS 
systems is extremely rewarding.

“My observation in many cities, 

especially in the city of Detroit, is 
that sometimes you are the best part 
of that child’s day,” he said.

After the event, Education senior 

Claire Forhan said she thought the 
panelists offered hope.

“You enter DPS not only as a 

teacher, but also as a fighter,” said 
Forhan. “It was encouraging to hear 
the efforts going on tonight and 
hear that there is some movement 
towards regaining local control.”

lot of confusion around medical 
amnesty, when to MIP and high 
risk game days, and of course, 
sexual misconduct, which is 
a big thing we’ve been talking 
about this year with the policy 
being revised in the University.”

Furano said having a CSG 

representation on DPSS can 
help bridge gaps of information 
between students and the police 
department, which she said she 
believes has been an issue in the 
past.

“As UMPD representative, I 

think that I can help the UMPD 
be 
more 
transparent 
with 

students and understand what’s 
going on and that there is not 
this big distance between policy 
that’s being created by the 

University and student,” Furano 
said. “Because if students don’t 
understand 
and 
they 
can’t 

engage with the policy, then 
how are they going to be able to 
follow it?”

LSA sophomore Jacqueline 

Reingold is also running for 
the seat. A member of Your 
Michigan, Reingold is currently 
CSG’s chief operations officer. 
She said she was inspired to run 
after attending the American 
Association of America’s Big 
Ten Conference and hearing the 
initiatives the other universities 
have taken to enhance their 
public safety. Reingold has also 
worked closely with Beyond the 
Diag, 

“I feel this is an important 

position 
that 
hasn’t 
been 

necessarily 
utilized 
to 
its 

fullest,” Reingold said. “I would 
love to be that student voice and 

to represent those students.”

Reingold said though she 

has not personally experienced 
issues with UMPD, she’s heard 
from students who felt they have 
recieved unjustified charges and 
were unsure of who to turn to.

“I think that what’s been 

happening across the country 
really brings this committee 
into 
light,”Reingold 
said. 

“All of the protests on other 
college campuses, I think it’s 
an important time for this 
committee to have a voice and 
stand strong as it represents 
students.”

Aside from the student seats, 

the other four positions on the 
committee are selected by a 
mix of nominations and voting. 
One of the faculty spots is also 
selected through a governance 
body — in this case, the Faculty 
Senate — instead of nomination. 

Nominees for the other faculty 
and staff spots are currently 
being decided. Faculty member 
nominations 
can 
be 
made 

through March 25.

David Potter, secretary of the 

University Faculty Senate and 
professor of Greek and Latin, 
said the committee suggests 
different 
ways 
to 
approach 

situations on campus to the 
police department. Potter, who 
runs the election process, added 
that the committee plays an 
important role by providing 
community guidance to DPSS.

“There have been times in the 

past when the department has 
responded to issues in ways that, 
while consistent with its mission, 
have been rather more aggressive 
than are the norm in an academic 
environment,” Potter said. “This 
was particularly the case with 
the issue of trespass orders.”

Taylor’s longtime predecessor 
John Hieftje, who was also at 
the party on Tuesday.

“I think what we did last 

time around has been right, and 
my plan for next term is to do it 
again, “ Taylor said, adding he 
is proud of improvements made 
in sustainability and road and 
stormwater 
infrastructure 

during his two-year term as 
mayor. “We as a city are going 
in the right direction.”

Taylor also emphasized the 

need to improve the supply of 
affordable housing, saying if the 
city fails to do so its economic 
diversity and the quality of life 
will be threatened.

“This is something that’s 

good for the people in need 
of affordable housing, and it’s 
good for people who don’t need 
affordable 
housing,” 
Taylor 

said. “Economically diverse 
communities are far better off 
than other communities.”

Many 
of 
Taylor’s 
City 

Council 
colleagues 
were 

present — as well as Hieftje 
— and spoke favorably of 
his leadership and ability to 
accommodate 
conflicting 

opinions on City Council and 
from the public.

“One 
thing 
about 
(Ann 

Arbor) is that we’re doing way, 
way better than almost any 
other (city),” Hieftje said as he 
introduced Taylor. “It isn’t an 
easy job.”

Many of the local residents 

at the event said though they 
may not necessarily agree with 
Taylor on every issue, they trust 
his character to best represent 
the city and accommodate its 
conflicting viewpoints.

Ann Arbor resident Scott 

Trudeau said he disagrees 
with the mayor on some issues 
but looks favorably on Taylor’s 
leadership.

“I think in general he’s 

done a good job of making 
his 
decisions, 
balancing 

the 
concerns, 
organizing 

the 
council 
and 
overall 

representing the city,” Trudeau 
said.

He added that he appreciates 

Taylor’s focus on affordable 
housing, saying he thought 
housing costs in the city must 
be addressed to preserve the 
city’s character.

“If housing continues to 

become unaffordable, we’re 
going to have a certain class 
of relatively well-off people,” 
Trudeau said. “Ann Arbor’s 
character has been a lot funkier 
and more interesting, and that 
requires more people of more 
socioeconomic statuses.”

Kathy Griswold, a longtime 

resident of Ann Arbor also 
in attendance, said she has 
been long critical of the city 
administration on pedestrian 
safety, 
including 
during 

Taylor’s 
time 
as 
mayor. 

However, she said she thought 
the continuation of Taylor’s 
leadership is necessary for 
substantive change to be made 
in the city.

“I am not at all satisfied with 

the (city) government … a lot 
of our processes are broken,” 
Griswold said. “I can further 
my 
agenda 
of 
pedestrian 

safety and good governance 
by working through Taylor’s 
organization more easily than 
trying to develop another one.”

pretty welcoming,” Golden 
said. “People would sit down 
and watch us work and chat 
with us and say they were 
happy 
to 
see 
something 

that looked good in their 
neighborhood.”

Zielke said the projects 

Golden Sign Co. completes are 
sometimes large and complex 
but they have no current 
desire to hire any additional 
help 
to 
complete 
future 

projects.

“I have more interest in 

painting signs than managing 
people,” he said.

Awareness Center funding.

“It would be important to 

have that non-voting member 
on (the) Board of Regents 
and 
various 
committees 

talking about diversity, equity, 
curriculum,” Griggs said.

Schafer also stressed in a 

March interview the need for 
having a student on the Board 
of Regents, saying the CSG 
president’s five-minute address 
during meetings is not enough 
in terms of open communication 
and 
transparency 
between 

students and administration.

“He doesn’t have access to 

committee meetings, he doesn’t 
have 
access 
to 
back-door 

conversations within the Board 
of Regents, and he’s not seen as 
an official member of the Board 
of Regents,” Schafer said.

The 
state 
of 
Michigan’s 

constitution 
outlines 
the 

composition 
and 
roles 
of 

the 
regents, 
establishing 

eight 
members 
with 
eight-

year terms “who shall be 
elected as provided by law.” 
Consequently, 
the 
creation 

of a student voting position 
would require amending the 
state constitution, which can 
be accomplished through one 
of three ways: the change can 
be placed on the ballot by a 
citizen-led initiative garnering 
a minimum of signatures, be 
referred to the ballot by the 
state legislature, or be amended 
through 
a 
constitutional 

convention.

The 
state 
constitution 

also provides for the current 
university president to sit on 
the board, but as an ex-officio 
member 
in 
a 
non-voting 

capacity.

In an interview, Regent Mike 

Behm raised some concerns 
with 
the 
logistics 
behind 

having a student member with 
voting capabilities on the board, 
noting the current eight-year 
term structure in particular.

“We serve for 8-year terms, 

so I’m always up for good ideas, 
but with these 8-year terms, I 
don’t know if a student would 
want to stay for the whole 
term or after they graduated. 
They would then want to have 
someone 
take 
their 
place,” 

Behm said.

Universities 
in 
several 

other states have provided for 
student representation on their 
boards through the creation of 
a de facto, non-voting student 
member — a model Schafer said 
he would like to see adopted at 
the University.

The Association of Governing 

Bodies reports 70.8 percent of 
public institutions have some 
sort of student presence on 
their governing body.

When 
asked 
about 
the 

addition of a non-voting member, 
University spokesperson Kim 
Broekhuizen wrote in an e-mail 
interview that she did not see a 
specified provision for it in the 
current law.

“That doesn’t mean it isn’t 

possible, I’m just not aware of 
one,” she wrote.

Schafer stressed the addition 

of a non-voting member would 
not require an amendment 
to the state constitution as 
there is no explicit provision 
prohibiting students from the 
Board of Regents. He said a 
non-voting 
student 
member 

would still be an invaluable, 
effective 
resource, 
pointing 

to the University of California 
systems as an example, which 
allow for both voting and non-
voting board members.

Students at UC schools may 

apply for the position through 
a standard application process.

Broekhuizen wrote that any 

registered voter may run for 
regent on the state ballot for the 

eight voting positions already 
established, including a student.

“Candidates are nominated 

by the state political parties,” 
she added.

Behm, who is also an attorney 

in Flint, highlighted that a 
student running for regent on a 
ballot would have to be a citizen 
of Michigan, which he said 
might prompt legal concerns.

“It sort of has a bit of an equal 

protection argument because 
part of the student body who 
are out-of-state students might 
say, ‘Wait a minute, I want to 
sit on the board,’ and that’s 
another thing that would have 
to be addressed,” Behm said.

However, 
he 
said 
he 

appreciates such new ideas and 
would be interested in learning 
more about the platform point, 
acknowledging this particular 
initiative isn’t something he has 
explored in the past.

“I do think that in the year 

that I’ve been on the board, that 
we’ve been really trying to be 
open to more people’s ideas,” 
Behm said. “I come from the 
school of the more people you 
listen to and the more ideas, the 
better. Hopefully, that’ll help 
allay some of those concerns.”

Schafer said his main goal 

is to begin the groundwork for 
future 
CSG 
administrations 

and pave the way for them to 
continue to advocate for student 
voice on the board.

“We 
believe 
that 
it’s 

entirely within the realm of 
possibility that a non-voting 
student is added to the Board 
of Regents by the end of our 
administration,” Schafer said. 
“But I think it’s also important 
to understand that some of this 
stuff set forth by each party we 
have to understand will not be 
accomplished within the life of 
our administration or our life at 
Michigan.”

NEWMICH
From Page 1A

@MICHIGANDAILY


supervise the University and direct expendi-
tures. To have a greater voice on campus, new-
MICH advocates for a student representative on 
the board. Your Michigan told the Daily that a 
student representative is not necessary, because 
the CSG president currently has an allotted time 
to present at every Board of Regents meeting. 
Though this is a compelling rebuttal by Your 
Michigan, we believe creating a position for a 
student on the board would allow this represen-
tative to focus solely on the board, to be active in 
discussions with the regents and not just to serve 
as a presenter of information, and to provide a 
second voice for students. The student repre-
sentative would actually sit with members of 
the board and participate in dialogue, unlike 
the CSG president.

The state constitution, beyond creating eight 

elected, voting positions for the regents, addi-
tionally only specifies that the University presi-
dent sits on the Board of Regents as an ex-officio 
member. It does not specify about any other ex-
officio members, so having a student reresenta-
tive is undoubtedly contestable. However, even if 
newMICH does not succeed in winning a student 
spot on the Board of Regents, Schafer and Griggs 
have demonstrated they have working relation-
ships with administrators that will help them 
enact changes regardless of whether there is a 
student on the board.

Nonetheless, in light of this risk, it is notable 

that CSG has a budget of $400,000 per year, 
which means many items on newMICH’s plat-
form are achievable only if they receive funding 
from the Board of Regents. This funding will 
most likely only come if there is student repre-
sentation by a non-voting student member. With-
out representation by a student representative, 
it is unlikely that newMICH will be able to fully 
execute many of their goals.

All three parties do share a number of plans, 

most notably the demand to increase minority 
enrollment and improve diversity and inclusion 
on campus. Your Michigan plans to “improve 
recruiting and outreach efforts to underrepre-
sented high school communities...” Similarly, 
newMICH wants to “improve the relationship 
between UM and Detroit Public Schools.” Both 
parties are aware that change in this area is diffi-
cult to achieve within CSG, but the relationships 
newMICH has built with administrators, such 
as Dean of Students Laura Blake Jones, show us 
they are already on the way to working toward 
these goals.

DAAP’s commitment to social justice is laud-

able, but their ideas will be very difficult to 
achieve in practice. DAAP proposes to eliminate 
the use of the SAT and ACT in favor of a system 
similar to the Texas 10 percent plan, which guar-

antees any student in Texas in the top 10 percent 
of their high school automatic admission to pub-
lic universities in the state. Though the SAT and 
ACT have been shown to exhibit a racial bias, 
this plan will be extremely difficult for DAAP to 
implement without a working relationship with 
the administration, which they currently lack 
and have stated they have no interest in starting.

All parties agree mental health resources need 

improvement, and we appreciate this collective 
desire to change the status quo, but newMICH 
is the only party that plans to fully expand both 
Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter and Counseling and Psychological Services 
to North Campus. In 2014, CAPS launched their 
embedded model, which places counselors in 
specific schools and colleges to meet an increase 
in demand for mental health resources. Though 
three of these counselors were assigned to North 
Campus schools in July 2014, the need for mental 
resources for students on North Campus still has 
not been met and newMICH’s plans best address 
this discrepancy. Additionally, newMICH can-
didates have also stated that they have a good 
relationship with the director of CAPS, a con-
nection vital to a productive CSG-CAPS partner-
ship. At the CSG debate hosted by the Daily on 
March 11, newMICH spoke of their plans to add 
11 counselors to decrease the University’s 1:1,300 
student to counselor ratio to 1:1,000. The party’s 
specific plan to improve mental health resources 
demonstrates knowledge of the system and what 
exactly needs to be done that is not found among 
their opponents.

While each party stressed the importance of 

preventing sexual misconduct, we found that 
newMICH’s plan has the most specific goals. In 
addition to expanding SAPAC to North Campus, 
newMICH wants to work to change SAPAC’s 
24/7 crisis hotline to a 24/7 in-office presence. 
In contrast, Your Michigan wants CSG to serve 
as an “ally” to SAPAC to create culture shift and 
plans to expand the Panhellenic Peer Educa-
tor program to other clubs and sports teams. 
We appreciate both initiatives, and would hope 
that any winning party would try to incorporate 
their opponent’s ideas. An interesting addition 
to the mental health conversation on campus 
came from DAAP. At the CSG debate hosted by 
the Daily, they suggested the increase in mental 
health problems came directly from the lack of 
an inclusive environment on our campus. DAAP 
aims at solving mental health by addressing cam-
pus culture issues first.

newMICH has the candidates and the ideas 

to make a change on campus. They will advocate 
for better mental health resources, more effec-
tive resources for victims of sexual misconduct 
and an increase in student voice on the Board of 
Regents. A CSG governed by newMICH would 
make incremental changes in the right direction.

I believe there’s a sense of achievability that 

comes with being on a college campus, especially 
one as prestigious as this university’s. We all came 
to Ann Arbor with the belief that our experiences 
here would be life-changing; that we would, in 
some way, make an impact on our surroundings 
and be remembered by the students following 
after us. Ever since freshman orientation, we’ve 
been told that we’re the “leaders and best” 
because we’ve been accepted into the University 
of Michigan, and therefore we will someday 
change the world. And despite the endless hours 
of stress that this institution will end up putting 
us through, there’s a sense of invincibility, a 
sense of invulnerability, that comes with being a 
University of Michigan student.

In many ways, this type of environment suits 

a college campus. It helps to foster ideas and 
creativity, and it encourages students to take 
the risks that will make them better workers 
and thinkers in the future. It’s this type of self-
confidence that has inspired great thinkers and 
scholars for millennia. Accepting challenges 
that may or may not be out of one’s league has 
become a crucial part of the college process, 
and college campuses foster an environment 
that tells everyone they can and will succeed at 
whatever project they take on. Failure is a taboo 
word, never discussed and never accepted.

But Icarus flew too close to the sun, and 

likewise, 
Michigan 
students 
sometimes 

overstep their bounds. This happens all over 
the campus, when students decide to talk 
about topics they don’t necessarily understand, 
arguing for or against certain positions and 
then taking action based on those discussions. 
Especially in the case of social justice, students 
feel that because they took a sociology course 
or attended a protest that they are qualified to 
speak on behalf of a marginalized group they 
may not be a part of.

In some ways, this can be a positive thing; at 

least people are aware of and discussing issues 
that really are important to the world. But on the 
negative side, what type of information is being 
spread? Is this information truly helpful to the 
marginalized group, or is it actually working to 

silence and oppress these individuals more?

I recently attended a discussion about 

anxiety and depression where the facilitators 
had not been trained to talk about the specific 
topic at hand. As a result, one of the facilitators 
inadvertently insulted a participant for the 
decisions they made with their body. In their 
defense, the facilitators were very receptive to 
the criticism they received from the attendees. 
In my opinion, the organization, who does 
do great things on campus and of which I 
am a proud member, should have been more 
sensitive and hired trained professionals to 
host this dialogue.

This type of insensitivity is also prevalent in 

discussions regarding sexual assault on campus. 
I recently heard someone running for Central 
Student Government talk about this topic using 
heteronormative pronouns, with “her” referring to 
the survivor and “him” referring to the perpetrator. 
Using this type of language demonstrates a 
lack of awareness, as people within the LGBTQ 
community face sexual violence at a distressing rate 
and is detrimental as it takes away the voices of the 
people within this community, discouraging them 
from seeking help.

Here at the University, we are told that we can 

do anything. On this campus, people have found 
the inspiration to become doctors, writers, movie 
stars and politicians. This environment has 
cultivated some of the best learners and thinkers 
of our time. As students here, we are constantly 
being told that nothing is out of reach and that 
our work will someday change the world. But 
we are never told that in some situations it’s not 
our place to speak out, that it’s OK to be quiet. 
Although it may be hard, sometimes admitting 
you don’t know enough about an issue to act on 
it is the most impactful thing a person could do. I 
will freely admit there are a lot of issues I would 
not be confident to speak out on, knowing that 
my well-intentioned words could accidentally 
harm someone. In this type of situation, the 
best course of action is to educate oneself before 
moving forward.

O

n a beautiful spring day last 
week, 
President 
Barack 

Obama strolled into the Rose 

Garden 
and 

executed 
what 

might 
be 
the 

most 
brilliant 

political move of 
his 
presidency. 

He 
introduced 

Merrick Garland, 
an 
unimposing 

figure who was 
visibly moved by 
his nomination to 
the highest court 
in the land. The 63-year-old jurist 
called it “the greatest honor of his life” 
before correcting himself, noting that 
he could not forget the comparable 
honor of his wife agreeing to marry 
him. Garland came off as incredibly 
likable and given the political climate, 
the president’s move is ingenious. 
And yet I cannot help but be partially 
disappointed.

In all likelihood, Merrick Garland 

will sit on the Supreme Court. Nothing 
is definite, and I will avoid making 
the brash claims that some senators 
and journalists have made over the 
course of the last week, but the current 
situation favors President Obama and 
his party in a handful of ways; therein 
lies the genius. Senate Republicans 
have made it abundantly clear that 
their position will not change. Majority 
leader Mitch McConnell commented 
that the GOP’s unwillingness to 
consider any nominee was “about 
the principle, not a person.” Just six 
senators have indicated they would 
be willing to meet with Garland, and 
only Mark Kirk (R–Ill.) has called for 
an up-or-down vote. There will be no 
vote before the election in November.

For Democrats hoping to reclaim 

the Senate and for Hillary Clinton, 
Obama’s pick is great news. What 
better demonstration of Republican 
obstructionism than refusing to even 
hold a hearing for someone who is 
consistently said to be moderate, 
fair and qualified? According to the 

Martin-Quinn 
scores, 
ironically, 

Garland would sit firmly on the court’s 
liberal wing; but what matters is the 
public perception and the narrative 
that voters see played out in the media 
— that he is a centrist and an effort 
at compromise on the part of the 
president.

How can GOP senators like Pat 

Toomey, 
Kelly 
Ayotte 
and 
Rob 

Portman, all seeking reelection in 
battleground 
states, 
defend 
this 

action? Add in Donald Trump as the 
presumptive nominee and suddenly 
the Republican Party becomes defined 
by immaturity in 2016. Meanwhile, 
Merrick Garland not only paints the 
Democrats in the light of maturity and 
compromise, but he also highlights 
hypocrisy and partisan gridlock on 
the other side of the aisle.

Recently, 
the 
prospect 
of 
a 

confirmation vote after the election 
was ruled out by Senate GOP 
leadership, with McConnell saying 
he “can’t imagine that a Republican 
majority in the United States Senate 
would want to confirm in a lame-duck 
session.” But talk is cheap. Should 
Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders 
win in November (not exactly a tall 
order against The Donald), why 
would conservatives wait for the next, 
undoubtedly more liberal, nominee? 
The next president will nominate 
two to three justices to the Court 
as it is, and if the Democrats win 
big in November, rejecting Garland 
would mean allowing a sizable liberal 
majority. Obama’s nomination of a 
centrist allows him to play good cop/
bad cop with his successor, which 
strengthens Garland’s chances at 
confirmation.

For all of these reasons, the 

nomination of Merrick Garland is a 
demonstration of impeccable political 
strategy on the part of the White 
House. But that doesn’t mean he’s 
the perfect nominee for the country, 
especially for the seat he is about to fill.

Antonin Scalia, though a staunch 

conservative with little in common 
with Garland, was a vocal advocate 

for diversity on the bench. In his 
dissent from the ruling in Obergefell 
v. Hodges, the case that ruled same-
sex marriage constitutional, Scalia 
bemoaned how unrepresentative he 
and his colleagues were of the country 
at large. The Court, he wrote, “consists 
of only nine men and women, all of 
them successful lawyers who studied 
at Harvard or Yale Law School,” and 
Garland would continue this trend. 
Before Scalia’s passing, eight justices 
grew up on either the East or West 
Coast, with four coming from New 
York City alone. All but one have been 
a circuit court judge. Garland would 
make the fourth Jewish justice on the 
Court and the fifth white man.

Writing opinions takes more than 

legal expertise — it often takes life 
experience. When conferring on civil 
rights cases in the late 20th century, 
the justices turned to Thurgood 
Marshall for his experience as an 
African-American man in a previously 
segregated society. When deciding 
cases on the topic of campaign finance, 
Sandra Day O’Connor, the only justice 
at the time who had ever run for office 
in her career, shed important light on 
the context of the legal question. But 
what does Merrick Garland bring in 
terms of diversity? He’d be the only 
justice on the bench from Illinois. 
That’s about it.

No one can deny that Merrick 

Garland’s nomination is a political 
move. 
Whether 
it’s 
meant 
to 

embarrass Senate Republicans or 
give Hillary Clinton a boost with 
moderates in November is yet to 
be seen. But what is nearly certain 
is that President Obama’s third 
nominee to the Court is brilliant, 
fair-minded and professional. Given 
the current political landscape, 
he will likely sit on the Supreme 
Court someday in the near future. 
Unfortunately, this comes at the cost 
of judicial diversity, which may have 
to wait for the next administration.

T

he Undergraduate Library 
isn’t the only place in 
town to get books, though 

I’m sure many 
students 
don’t 

know about the 
alternative: the 
Ann Arbor Dis-
trict Library, or 
AADL for short. 
For students from 
out of state or 
even out of town, 
AADL 
probably 

doesn’t 
factor 

highly into their 
day-to-day 
rou-

tine. This strikes 
me as strange, simply because I’m so 
deeply in love with this library and 
all it offers to the community.

Sure, there are weeks that go by 

when I don’t venture down William 
Street to do homework among child-
height bookshelves in the warm and 
brightly colored kids’ section, but 
barely a week passes when I don’t 
at least set foot inside of the down-
town library. More often, I’ll make 
a quick stop to check the hold shelf 
and peruse in search of new com-
ics while I wait for my bus to pull up 
across the street. I grew up reading 
in this library, or at one of its four 
other branches around town, and 
AADL has always been a part of my 
life. I can’t really imagine waiting for 
the bus without first going across the 
street to check for books on hold.

Laura Raynor, a Youth and Adult 

Services librarian who has worked 
at AADL for many years, empha-
sized that the library’s mission is to 
reach as many people as possible and 
to serve the public in whatever way 
makes the most sense.

“We’re always thinking about our 

population,” she said in an interview 
with the Daily. “Who are we try-
ing to reach? And how can we do that 
in creative new ways that will keep 
the library vital in the community.” 
Because of this, the library has been 
working to expand its collection in 
recent years by making objects such 
as art prints, book-club kits and house-
hold tools from telescopes to sewing 

machines available for checkout.

“We’ve really thought carefully 

about what should be available for 
checkout that won’t compete with 
the local businesses in town,” Raynor 
explained. While I mainly go for the 
books, it’s always fun to walk past 
the art prints and watch kids play 
with the music mixers or magnifying 
glasses on display.

“Programming is one of our pri-

orities, and we reach out to all ages,” 
Raynor said. In addition, AADL 
offers a number of programs — from 
video game tournaments to work-
shops on getting published — that are 
free to the public. Aside from impart-
ing skills or just offering a good time, 
the events also foster a sense of com-
munity, allowing friends and families 
a chance to do something fun togeth-
er or giving people the chance to 
connect and make friends over their 
shared interests.

The thought that many students at 

the University don’t know about such 
an impressive and versatile resource 
right here in town is somewhat of 
a downer for me. I’ve found books 
at AADL that for whatever reason 
weren’t available in the University’s 
library system, and I’ve passed many 
a productive hour getting homework 
done at the spacious tables present in 
every branch. I’ve picked up unusual 
titles at the Friends Book Shop, a won-
derfully affordable place for used-
book shopping inside the downtown 
location. I’ve even won a couple of 
gaming tournaments in my day.

This is why I was thrilled to learn 

AADL has been forging new connec-
tions with the campus community in 
recent years. Booths on the Diag and 
visits to classrooms have helped to 
spread the word about the library’s 
services, as have collaborations with 
the University’s library system. Cer-
tain events such as Proyecto Avance: 
Latino Mentoring Association meet-
ings, which pair students in the Resi-
dential College’s Spanish program 
with families seeking help with 
English as a second language, and 
Nerd Nite, a fun monthly trivia event 
held at the bar LIVE, have served to 
expand AADL’s reach all the way to 

people of my own age group.

I find it interesting that some stu-

dents, then, might come to know the 
library through these outreach pro-
grams, while my understanding of 
AADL comes from years of explor-
ing its offerings. Raynor emphasized 
that no matter how innovative AADL 
tries to become by incorporating 
technology and new materials into 
the catalog, the traditional collection 
of books, magazines and movies still 
sees a lot of use.

Raynor says visitors come to the 

library seeking a place of comfort. 
“They can find quiet here — all of 
the stereotypical library things are 
still in place, because we still see the 
need is there.” For her, being a librar-
ian is about watching kids grow up at 
the library, where they can develop a 
life-long love of books and learning. 
That passion is present inside any 
branch of AADL, which truly serves 
as a focal point where members of 
the vibrant Ann Arbor community 
can come together and learn — from 
the resources around them as well 
as from one another.

At the end of the day, I go to the 

public library because it’s free, 
it’s convenient and it’s familiar. 
It’s what comes to mind when one 
thinks of the word library. In many 
ways, I did much of my growing 
up between the old brick walls 
and metal shelves, and among the 
thousands of pages and stories 
contained in just the downtown 
branch alone. I don’t intend to stop 
using this collection, even with 
all the resources on campus that 
are made available to me because 
of my student status. That may 
be partly because, even for those 
with no library card, it’s always 
free to walk down William Stret 
and step through those doors. Stu-
dents who are interested can apply 
for a card for free. With or with-
out that, find a good book or your 
favorite TV show on Blu-ray, grab 
an open table or study room and 
stay as long as you want.

‘Nashville’ wedding

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

There’s nothing like a wedding 

to bring deep-seated family issues 
to the forefront. Rayna (Connie 
Britton, “Fri-
day 
Night 

Lights”) and 
Deacon’s 
(Charles 
Esten, 
“Enlight-
ened”) tumul-
tuous past has 
finally found 
its resolution 
in their mar-
riage. 
But 

what should seemingly be a happy 
occasion for the two deserving 
characters ends up being a roller-
coaster of doubt and family drama.

After the years of alcoholism and 

bitter fighting that have plagued 
Deacon’s relationship with Rayna, 
the two have overcome more pain-
ful experiences than many other 
TV couples to finally tie the knot. 
Though the two are finally happy, 
Rayna’s 
overprotective 
sister 

Tandy (Judith Hoag, “Armaged-
don”) can’t bring herself to share 
in their joy after everything Dea-
con has put her sister through. It’s 
understandable, but still a banal 
point of conflict for the episode. 
Her dislike for Deacon seeps into 
the minds of Maddie and Daphne 
(Newcomers Lennon Stella and 
Maisy Stella), who are already feel-
ing conflicted about their mother’s 
nuptials. Pretty much your average 
celebrity mom getting married to 
the recovered alcoholic love of her 
life family dynamic.

The family goes to great lengths 

to keep the wedding private, but 
the location and date are of course 
eventually leaked to the tabloids. 
In a spontaneous moment of post-
rehearsal dinner action, Deacon 
attacks a particularly tenacious 
reporter who sticks his camera 
in Maddie’s face. For some rea-
son, her father trying to protect 
her from media parasites causes 
Maddie to become terrified of 
her father and the thought of him 

and her mother getting married 
(though their wedding is all she’s 
wanted since discovering that he’s 
her birth father).

Poor Daphne, the youngest and 

inevitably neglected member of 
the family, also has reservations 
about her mom marrying some-
one who’s her sister’s birth father 
but not hers. Going along with 
the show’s efforts to make Rayna 
both a acclaimed country singer 
superstar and devoted mother, the 
various conflicts threatening her 
wedding are neatly resolved in just 
a few calm, reasonable conversa-
tions with her sister and daugh-
ters. That’s essentially how most of 
the show’s conflicts end — with a 
family-friendly, unsatisfying, dull 
invocation of emotional reasoning.

While handling all this with her 

usual poise, Rayna must continual-
ly reassure Deacon that their wed-
ding should happen. Though it’s 
hard not to support their relation-
ship, which Deacon has worked 
hard to reclaim, it’s disappointing 
to see him as the anxious shell of a 
man agonizing over losing it all at 
any sign of trouble. While the show 
doesn’t fall into the trap of once 
again creating irrevocable conflict 
at Deacon’s expense, turning to 
textbook family conflict falls short 
of the show’s typically thoughtful 
and compelling dramatic narra-
tive.

With Juliette’s (Hayden Panet-

tiere, “Heroes”) absence sorely 
felt in the episode, the triviality 
of some of the drama is especially 
salient. Her character adds allure 
and drama to the series, draw-
ing us in with her brazenness 
and emotional plights. While she 
receives treatment for her postpar-
tum depression, Avery (Jonathan 
Jackson, “General Hospital”) helps 
sustain her public image and care 
for their daughter. This culminates 
in an abrupt emotional meltdown 
at Rayna and Deacon’s wedding, 
when he can no longer stand 
lying to the wedding guests about 
Juliette’s whereabouts.

The consequences of Juliette’s 

struggles are especially moving, 
given Hayden Panettiere’s real-

life grapple with PPD. Though the 
show had no way of predicting that 
Panettiere’s reality and Juliette’s 
storyline would intersect under 
unfortunate circumstances, her 
story demonstrates the show’s 
ability to tackle difficult topics 
with poignancy and depth. With 
one of the show’s most well-writ-
ten central characters temporar-
ily gone, there’s even less content 
to hold our attention, leaving the 
remaining characters floundering 
to hold the story up.

While there’s still some drama 

left to go around without Juliette, 
it’s not much to stretch through 
the remainder of the season. Layla 
still reels from the death of Jeff, 
who fell off the roof trying to save 
Juliette from killing herself. It’s 
apparent 
something’s 
brewing 

in her mind as she quietly sulks 
through the episode. Though we 
can’t blame her for hurting, her 
pattern of falling victim to forces 
in the series more compelling than 
her, then bouncing back with some 
ego-driven, half-baked plan to stir 
up trouble is getting a little old. I’m 
honestly not really sure I even care 
what she’s up to this time, and it 
seems like the writers were more 
interested in delivering an audi-
ence-pleasing TV wedding to the 
show’s fans anyways.

Rather than continuing the 

show’s dramatic momentum, the 
midseason premiere serves more 
as a chance for the audience to 
catch their breath. The wedding 
itself offers an overarching reso-
lution to one of the most riveting 
storylines of the series, forcing the 
show to have to think up sources of 
tension elsewhere. The remaining 
subplots either tie up loose ends 
from conflicts in previous epi-
sodes or introduce inconsequen-
tial problems that are immediately 
resolved within the episode itself. 
Though the midseason premiere 
feels more like a conclusion than 
a new beginning, the soapy nature 
of “Nashville” has the potential to 
galvanize new subplots that will 
reenergize the series. But if the 
show’s going to do so, it’s going to 
have to do it quickly.

Improv Fest at ‘U’

By NATALIE ZAK

Daily Community Culture Editor

The lights are beating down 

as Ross senior Lauren Barrett 
and her teammates in Midnight 
Book Club stand frozen in place 
on stage. Sweat 
drips 
down 

her face as the 
person 
whose 

hands 
fate-

fully 
clapped 

moments 
before carefully 
decides 
how 

he or she will 
approach 
the 

situation. 
Sec-

onds later Bar-
rett has moved 
off stage and 
the next scene with new charac-
ters and players is already unfold-
ing before the audience’s eyes.

An example of Freeze Tag, one 

of the many kinds of long-form 
improvisation groups like Mid-
night Book Club perform, this skit 
involve two or more members of 
the group acting out strange and 
hilarious storylines that begin, 
grow and progress from a word 
suggested by the audience. The 
interactions can range from two 
moms at Lollapalooza to parents 
casually talking about how much 
they can’t stand their son as the 
players continuously tag one 
another in and out of scenes. But 
unlike short-form in which bits 
have no relation to each other, the 
ideal goal of long-form improv is 
to tie the unrelated events and 
characters together in the end 
in order to create a storyline 
that originated from nothing but 
group 
member’s 
imaginations 

and gut reactions.

“So many people at Michigan 

are interested in comedy but have 
had limited exposure to it because 
it’s centered in LA, Chicago and 
New York. That’s why I’m so 
excited to have a festival here,” 
Barrett said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily. “Improv can 
be an artform especially when it 
goes right.”

President of the University’s 

improv group Midnight Book 
Club and brand ambassador for 
Funny or Die University of Michi-
gan, Barrett has been interested 
in improvisation and comedy 
since the age of 18 and is now able 
to bring the University its first 
annual improv festival. Due to a 
stroke of luck in the form of the 
Upright Citizens Brigade Tour-
ing Company, Barrett and fellow 
improvisers from groups around 
campus had seized the opportu-
nity to bring comedy to the main-
stage of Rackham Auditorium on 
March 26.

“The Upright Citizens Brigade 

Touring Company reached out to 

Kelsey Fox, a member of ComCo 
and asked how to get a show here 
on campus,” Barrett said. “Rather 
than forward that information 
onto the University we kind of 
just grabbed onto it.”

Along with LSA sophomore 

Kelsey Fox and LSA senior Ryan 
McDonough, Barrett reached out 
to several other groups not only 
from the University but other 
schools and independent compa-
nies, as well.

“We want this to be the first of 

a long series of festivals. The idea 
is that we’ll get the groundwork 
set with a couple of Michigan 
teams, a couple of other schools, 
a couple independent teams and a 
couple of professional teams. And 
from there it’ll just keep grow-
ing,” Barrett said.

With teams such as University 

of Iowa’s Paperback Rhino and 
George Washington University’s 
receSs, this festival will present 
not only the skilled comedians 
that are hidden on our campus 
and others, but the skills of pro-
fessional independent groups as 
well.

ImprovOlympic and Second 

City, the two biggest performance 
theaters in improvisational com-
edy, both centered in Chicago, 
have produced comedians rang-
ing from Del Close to Gilda Rad-
ner to Chris Farley. Now, they 
serve as places in which impro-
visers can get together and create. 
Independent groups from iO like 
Alterboyz and Wet Bus are two 
that Barrett, Fox and McDonough 
have reached out to to perform at 
Rackham Auditorium this Satur-
day.

Alterboyz, an independent, all-

female team, and Wet Bus, an iO 
team housing some of Midnight 
Book Club’s founding members, 
are performing in ten minute 
sets besides receSs, Paperback 
Rhino, the University’s own 
Comco, Midnight Book Club and 
Funny or Die University of Mich-
igan, with UCB Touring Com-
pany rounding out the event in a 
90-minute set.

Through grants and spon-

sorship from various Univer-
sity 
organizations, 
Fox 
and 

Barrett have managed to raise 
over $9,000. Funds will cover 
everything from props to airport 
transportation for the various 
groups.

Up until two and a half months 

ago, this festival barely existed 
other than hypothetical situa-
tions dreamt up by Barrett and 
other improvisers. But once UCB 
Touring Company reached out, 
the event grew swiftly and chaot-
ically as it overcame many of the 
time and space constraints with 
which it was presented. Because 
of this, Barrett remains optimis-
tic about the potential for future 

festivals.

“Next year, I want to get 

more improv groups on campus 
involved. Every single group on 
campus that has a call to comedy 
has a stake in this festival,” Bar-
rett said. “We found out two and a 
half months ago about UCB — this 
festival didn’t exist until then. We 
just wanted to make it happen so 
right now it’s at it’s smallest stage 
but we want to make it big.”

What differs from the typi-

cal University events put on at 
Rackham and Hill Auditorium is 
that this is improvisational com-
edy — it is silly and strange and 
unpredictable. Unrehearsed and 
on the spot, teammates play off 
one another’s visceral decisions. 
Although most of the time it is for 
the hilarity of the audience, there 
is also an undertone of caution 
that must be exercised in comedy 
on college campuses, especially 
when performed in this large a 
magnitude.

“In terms of what material is 

okay … in general we’re on a col-
lege campus so we have to keep in 
mind that one in so many people 
have been affected by something,” 
Barrett said. “At my age, my expe-
riences are too narrow to make a 
thoughtful comment on the spot 
about a certain issue. My rule of 
thumb is just don’t. If you’re good 
enough you won’t have to rely on 
controversial humor to make the 
audience feel interested. There’s 
a common expression that goes, 
‘Unless you’re about to make a 
comment about race at the Key & 
Peele level, just don’t.’ ”

And this is an accurate evalu-

ation to make, since well-inten-
tioned comedy can be easily 
misinterpreted and easily taken 
too far. But this is not the atmo-
sphere Barrett, Fox, Donough 
and the participants are trying 
to create. Rather, it will be one of 
fun and funniness, a point Bar-
rett passionately emphasized.

“Here’s your exposition: The 

audience can expect the event 
to be on March 26, in Rackham 
Auditorium, from 6-7:30 pm and 
then 9-11:30 pm. The audience 
can expect to have fun because 
that’s what matters most. They 
can expect to live, laugh, love, 
cry, sob — it’ll be the pursuit of 
life, love and happiness but most 
of all, it’ll just be fun.”

There is endless talent at the 

University found in the count-
less improvisation groups that 
hold their performances in back-
rooms of the Michigan Union and 
classrooms in the Ross School of 
Business. Through this festival, 
Barrett and her co-conspirators 
will be bringing these intimate, 
concealed environments to the 
mainstage in a grand endeavor to 
begin a new tradition at the Uni-
versity.

SMTD does Mozart

By ALLIE TAYLOR

Daily Arts Writer

From March 24-27, The School 

of Music, Theatre & Dance will put 
on a production of Mozart’s last 
great 
opera, 

“Così 
Fan 

Tutte” 
at 

the 
Lydia 

Mendels-
sohn Theatre. 
“Così 
Fan 

Tutte” 
liter-

ally translates 
to 
“Women 

are like that;” 
it is a com-
edy following 
the story of 
two women, 
Fiordiligi and 
Dorabella, 
and their respective beaus, Fer-
rando and Guglielmo. As the men 
are bragging about the fidelity and 
commitment of their women, a 
misogynistic older friend of theirs, 
Don Alfonso, bets 100 gold pieces 
that, if they follow everything 
he says, their women will betray 
them. Through a series of comi-
cal antics and schemes, the rela-
tionships take tumultuous turns, 
and all characters are faced with 
confusion and confronted with 
situations regarding their own 
faithfulness.

An incredibly immense amount 

of work has gone into this produc-
tion: the opera was cast in October, 
and the performers got their scores 
in 
November. 
Music 
rehears-

als began in January as soon as 
the Winter semester began, with 
staging beginning mid-February. 
Rehearsals with the live orches-
tra started a few weeks ago, and 
rehearsals on the Lydia Mendels-
sohn stage began just last week.

“The whole process has been an 

absolute blast,” said Josh Lovell, 
a first-year Masters student, in 
an interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “This is a very intense show 
for all of us. It’s great to do this as a 
part of the University of Michigan, 
where you are working with pro-
fessionals who can coach you along 
the way.”

Lovell, who worked profession-

ally with the Pacific Opera Victoria 
in Canada prior to beginning his 
studies at the University, will be 
playing the lead role of Ferrando, 
one of the two men trying to prove 
their significant other’s loyalty.

“Mozart writes realist stories 

with realistic characters that are 
all about the human condition. It’s 
a story that anyone can connect 
to,” Lovell said of “Così Fan Tutte.” 
“It’s not totally blown over the top 
— it is so real.”

“There’s such a high level of 

excitement,” said Amy Petrongelli. 

Petrongelli plays the role of Des-
pina, a servant who is bribed to 
help Don Alfonso in getting Fiordi-
ligi and Dorabella to be unfaithful. 
“Everybody is hungry. Everybody 
wants to be the next big thing. It 
creates such a fun atmosphere,” 
Petrongelli said of her cast mates.

Lovell agreed, saying “(The high 

level of excitement) builds a really 
nice momentum between the 
learning and performing process.”

The opera is in Italian, but there 

are supertitles above the stage that 
will translate everything that the 
performers sing.

“Sometimes operas can get 

really confusing, but we’re talk-
ing about love and relationships, 
and it’s set in modern day, so it will 
be really easy for the audience to 
understand what’s happening,” 
Petrongelli said.

The 
whimsical 
nature 
of 

Mozart’s composing style is evi-
dent through the humorous ele-
ments present in the music, acting 
and storyline.

“It’s really funny. It’s like a clas-

sical chick-flick.” Lovell said.

“Così Fan Tutte” is loved by 

international audiences, and is 
seen as one of Mozart’s three great 
operas, along with Don Giovanni 
and The Marriage of Figaro. Resi-
dents of Ann Arbor will have the 
opportunity to see this opera come 
to life next weekend.

‘Counting’ explores 
modern urban life

By JOE WAGNER

Daily Arts Writer

At the Ann Arbor Film Festival 

on 
March 
16, 
filmmaker 
Jem 
Cohen 

(“Museum 
Hours”) 
joked 
that 

documen-
tary is often 
called 
the 

bastard child 
of the dra-
matic 
nar-

rative 
film, 

so the essay 
film, the city symphony film, and 
the diary film must therefore be 
the bastards of documentary. He 
described his most recent film, 
“Counting,” as a combination of 
those three.

Told in 15 chapters, “Count-

ing” is an exploration of modern 
urban life. Finding beauty in the 
smallest of things, the film dis-
covers and rediscovers the intri-
cacies of the city. Each section 
varies drastically in length and is 
unique, powerful and impactful 
in its own right. The film travels 
through locations, not creating a 
linear narrative but rather form-
ing a slideshow of moving images.

Cohen has kept a large archive 

of shoots throughout his career 
and over the past three years, he 
has accumulated footage from 
New York, Moscow and Istanbul. 
In “Counting” he combines these 
three locations to construct his 
film.

The shots are not complicat-

ed nor particularly difficult to 
achieve. Cohen shoots the city 
from the street, always on the 
go. He depicts what it feels like 
to be walking on the boardwalk 
in Coney Island or through the 
Red Square. Cohen gets his hands 
dirty showing the little things 
that make the city come alive. 
He shows trash stuck in place — 
slowly revealing that place is in 
a gigantic tangled tree and the 
tree is in a parking lot in Istanbul. 
Everyday objects become pieces 
of art. Description can’t do jus-
tice to the images Cohen has cap-
tured.

The film is beautiful and spa-

cious. Cohen chooses not to make 
a clear and firm thesis so as to 
not dictate the viewer’s thoughts 
on the film as a whole. The film 
allows for the viewer to interpret 
it in their own way. Certain sec-
tions may speak to some view-

ers and other sections will speak 
to others. But this is part of the 
beauty of Cohen’s film — its open-
ness allows for interpretation and 
study of urban life, modern life 
and the movie itself.

The clearest, and possibly most 

impactful, section of the film is 
“Three-Letter Words” in which 
Cohen photographs people mov-
ing through Manhattan with 
audio of leaders of the NSA tes-
tifying before Congress. This 
section is by far the most heavy-
handed. However, this is not a bad 
quality in this instance. In a film 
where the viewer is able to wan-
der, study images and interpret 
them how they like, it is refresh-
ing to be given a clear cut message 
from the filmmaker.

Although the film is success-

ful, it is no doubt difficult. Lasting 
nearly two hours with essentially 
no dialogue or narration, except 
text, it is not for those who bore 
easily. But it is the lack of these 
two things which allow the view-
er to take the time to analyze and 
understand the images Cohen 
presents. “Counting” is a long 
exploration of the modern urban 
experience in an avant-garde yet 
accessible form.

W

henever I think 
“vegan,” the per-
son who comes to 

mind isn’t some earthy yogi, but 
rather his stark opposite: Ron 
Swan-
son from 
“Parks 
and Rec-
reation.” 
If 
you 

haven’t 
seen 
the 

show, 
I’ll 
give 

you some 
insight 
as to just 
how obsessed this man is with 
meat.

For 
instance, 
when 
he 

finds his soul food: “I’d go to 
a banquet in honor of those 
Somali pirates if they served 
bacon-wrapped shrimp.” At a 
restaurant: “Just give me all 
the bacon and eggs you have ... I 
worry what you just heard was 
‘give me a lot of bacon and eggs.’ 
What I said was, ‘Give me all 
the bacon and eggs you have.’”

And finally, when he walks 

in onco-worker Chris Traeger 
doing yoga: “There’s a hot, 
spinning cone of meat in the 
Greek restaurant next door. I 
don’t know what it is, but I want 
to eat the whole thing.”

Don’t get me wrong; Ron 

Swanson is hilarious. But the 
guy’s dietary habits, to put it 
nicely, are not something to 
emulate in real life. There’s 
never reason to eat an entire 
cone of meat. Or all the bacon 
and eggs. And according to 
hundreds of dieticians, doctors 
and scientists, there’s really no 
reason — close your ears, Ron 
— we need meat or eggs in our 
diets at all.

But 
before 
all 
the 
Ron 

Swansons of the world run 
away, 
or 
even 
the 
more 

moderate, chicken and greek 
yogurt inclined eaters scram, 
hear this article out. (It might 
make you run a little faster — in 
a good way.)

“Veganism,” both a diet and 

a philosophy, can be loosely 
defined as a lifestyle that 
abstains 
from 
consuming 

animal 
products. 
Like 

vegetarians, 
vegans 
exclude 

meat from their diets, but they 
also reject dairy products, eggs, 
honey — all foods produced by 
animals — as well as processed 
foods with traces of animal, 
such as marshmallows that 
contain gelatin. Instead, vegan 
diets are plant-based, majorly 
consisting 
of 
unprocessed 

grains, 
vegetables, 
fruits, 

legumes (mainly beans), seeds 
and nuts.

They 
may 
sound 
like 

squirrels, but vegans are slowly 
but surely taking over the 
world. Though humans have 
been eating plant-based diets 
since our ancient scavenging 
days 
(berries 
and 
edible 

mushrooms, 
anyone?), 
the 

term “veganism” was properly 
coined in 1944 by Donald 
Watson, former secretary of 
the UK’s Vegetarian Society. 
At the time, vegetarianism was 
growing more popular, largely 
for 
ethical 
reasons. 
Soon, 

discussions 
surfaced 
about 

not only the maltreatment of 
animals in the meat industry, 
but 
also 
the 
unethical 

exploitation of animals for 
dairy and eggs.

In 
the 
decades 
that 

followed, 
veganism 
gained 

traction, 
especially 
in 
the 

1960s 
countercultural 
food 

movement. Then the 2000s 
brought 
a 
surge 
of 
vegan 

support: In 2004, Dr. T. Colin 
Campbell’s bestselling “China 
Study” argued that animal 
products are the real culprits 
in causing cancer and other 
diseases; the book prompted a 
group of filmmakers to produce 
“Forks Over Knives” in 2011, 
focused on case studies of 
people who improved their 
health 
by 
nixing 
a 
meat-

centered, high-sugar American 
diet. Though vegan proponents 
have been met with criticism 
— largely stemmed by doubts 
that veganism provides enough 

protein and other nutrients 
to be healthy — the American 
Dietetic Association affirms 
that a properly planned (read: 
you’re not only eating apples), 
plant-based diet is perfectly 
healthy.

What does a vegan meal look 

like? It might be a rice bowl 
with black beans, avocado, 
roasted sweet potatoes and pico 
de gallo, tortilla chips on the 
side. Or macaroni and “cheese,” 
noodles topped with a creamy 
blend of butternut squash and 
roasted peppers. If your mouth 
is watering, don’t worry — these 
steaming bowls of plant-based 
goodness are right here in Ann 
Arbor.

To 
learn 
more 
about 

veganism — and yes, eat that 
rice bowl — I visited The Lunch 
Room, Kerrytown’s all-vegan 
restaurant. After devouring my 
lunch, I met Phillis Englebert, 
co-owner of the restaurant, to 
pick her brain about veganism 
and 
see 
what 
her 
advice 

would be for college students 
interested in adopting the diet. 

In particular, I asked what 

the 
biggest 
misconception 

people had about veganism was.

“Four things,” Phillis said. 

“First, everyone thinks they 
won’t get enough protein. They 
don’t realize there’s protein in 
everything, even vegetables.” 
She pointed to my empty bowl 
of rice and beans. “See that? 
You just ate a bowl of protein.”

She continued, “Then they’ll 

think a vegan diet won’t fill 
them up. And that they’ll need 
supplements to make up for 
lost nutrients. Finally, people 
will say that it’s just too hard 
to figure out — too much 
sacrificing of food, too much 
planning for meals, too weird.”

For Phillis, cooking vegan 

meals 
has 
become 
like 

second nature. An on-and-off 
vegetarian since she was 16, 
Phillis adopted veganism in 
2007 when she discovered she 
was lactose intolerant. Before 
opening The Lunch Room in 
2013, she and co-owner Joel 
Panozzo hosted vegan dinner 
parties 
with 
their 
friends, 

which 
eventually 
led 
to 

operating a vegan food cart in 
Mark’s Carts on Main Street. 
Customer reactions — from 
vegans and non-vegans alike — 
were so positive that The Lunch 
Room was born.

“Looking around this room, 

I’d bet $100 that not one person 
is vegan,” Phillis said. There 
wasn’t a small crowd, either. 
Turns out, you don’t have to 
be vegan (Exhibit A: myself) 
to enjoy fresh, tasty, satisfying 
food that boosts your health 
and doesn’t break your bank. A 
hearty bowl of rice and beans, 
for example, was just $6 — a 
hell of a lot cheaper than Ron 
Swanson’s 16-ounce ribeye.

I also asked Phillis what her 

advice would be for a college 
student who was considering 
veganism.

“First of all, you need a good 

vegan cookbook,” Phillis said. 
(Her favorite is “Isa Does It,” 
available at Literati.) “You need 
about a dozen pantry staples, 
like 
grains, 
beans, 
spices 

and dressings. Then it’s all 
planning; I make a huge salad 
with grains, roasted veggies, 
nuts, chickpeas and dressings 
every weekend, and that’ll be 
my lunches for the week.”

Phillis said it’s all about 

experimenting and roasting, 
tossing 
together 
nuts 
and 

grains and fresh produce to 
make a meal that satisfies you. 
She added, “And feel free to 
stop in The Lunch Room, if you 
ever want to talk to a living, 
breathing vegan.”

And if I had to guess, I’d say 

they’re probably living and 
breathing better than the rest 
of us.

Tom Bissell talks 
new book tracing 
Christ’s apostles

By MERIN MCDIVITT

Daily Arts Writer

Renowned writer Tom Bissell 

travels the world for his books, 
dealing with Eastern European 
law enforcement, rocky landings 
in the Arctic and instability 
in 
war-torn 

Afghanistan 
and Iraq along 
the 
way. 
For 

his latest novel, 
“Apostle: 
Travels Among 
the 
Tombs 

of 
Twelve,” 

Bissell 
traced 

the footsteps of 
Jesus’ original 
followers 
to 

better understand their complex 
legacy. In a recent interview 
with The Michigan Daily, he 
reflected on his provocative 
career thus far.

His career has spanned not 

only continents, but genres. 
Often described as a travel 
writer by the press, Bissell and 
his publishers often shy away 
from this label as being overly 
narrow for a writer that covers 
everything from video games 
to 
history 
to 
contemporary 

world issues with eloquence and 
humor.

“I’ve 
been 
innovative 
or 

stupid enough — which is a 
fine line, really — to write a 
bunch of books that defy easy 
categorization,” 
Bissell 
said. 

“Most of them are technically 
travel books, and I like seeing 
them in the travel section, but 
often times they wind up getting 
shelved or grouped with other 
books that address the same 
subject matter but aren’t travel 
books.”

Bissell 
lets 
his 
own 

fascinations be an extension 
to 
his 
own 
voice 
through 

his 
prolific 
writing, 
which 

extends far beyond the book 
world 
into 
online 
columns 

and frequent appearances in 
magazines, 
anthologies 
and 

other publications. The only 
common 
thread 
that 
runs 

through this diverse body of 
work seems to be his own sense 
of curiosity — a driving interest 
in understanding the things that 
others take for granted, whether 
it be the latest edition of “Grand 
Theft Auto” or a thousand-year-
old religious movement.

“There’s travel but also a lot 

of history, for better or worse, 
because I enjoy writing about it, 
but I think that’s what creates 
this perception of categorical 
hybridization,” he explained. 
“Back when I taught, I used to do 
a class called ‘Weird Nonfiction: 
Geoff 
Dyer, 
Joan 
Didion, 

Ryszard 
Kapuscinski, 
John 

D’Agata, Eula Biss.’ I think, in 
my heart of hearts, that’s where 
I’d like to be shelved.”

All the international intrigue 

that has defined his career as 
a writer belies a small town 
upbringing 
in 
Escanaba 
in 

Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

“When I was a kid, Escanaba 

seemed like the center of the 
universe to me,” Bissell said. “I 
knew it wasn’t London or Paris, 
obviously, but not until I got 
out and about did I realize how 
comparatively 
sheltered 
life 

truly was there,” Bissell said. 
“This came as quite a shock to 
me, naturally. Yet Escanaba 
remains a hugely important 
part of my life and imagination. 
I love being from the Upper 
Peninsula.”

But this protected, isolated 

UP life wasn’t quite what it 
appeared. 
The 
foundations 

of Bissell’s writing life were 
established back then, in large 
part due to the influence of 
several friends of his father 
— wartime companion Philip 
Caputo and Jim Harrison, both 
well-respected 
writers 
who 

exposed Bissell to the realities of 
their world.

“It was probably the biggest 

gift a young wanna-be writer in 
the Upper Peninsula could have 
had. Being a writer never seemed 
to me like an impossible goal,” 
he said. “And from hearing them 
talk about their lives, I knew it 
wasn’t glamorous. It was hard. 
Very hard.”

Bissell’s latest book, eight 

years in the making, brought 
him to another corner of the 
world to satisfy an itch he has 
always had.

It 
began 
with 
“a 
deep 

and abiding interest in early 
Christianity — how it began, 
what happened to it — and my 
own desire to get to the bottom 
of what I actually felt about this 
topic I’d read so much about 
and lived with in my head for so 
long,” he explained.

His search for these answers, 

as 
personal 
as 
they 
were 

universal, took him throughout 
the ancient world and led him 
to plenty of texts, some as old 
as time and others hot off the 
presses.

For 
the 
aspiring 
writers 

of 
tomorrow, 
Bissell 
said 

there is no magic formula to 
success, particularly in travel 
or nonfiction, both notoriously 
finicky genres prone to constant 
reinvention and short attention 
spans. All he could offer is trust 
— in your own skills, and even 
more than that, in curiosity. 
Always complaining that no one 
ever writes about something 
you’re 
obsessed 
with? 
Do 

something about it.

“Write what you’d like to 

read,” he said. “And try to get 
paid for it.”

FOOTBALL
Mone back to 100 
percent in practice

After broken leg 
in 2015 fall camp, 
defensive tackle 

prepared to step in

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Already dominant for most 

of last season, the Michigan 
football team’s defensive line has 
yet another contributor healthy 
again for 2016.

Redshirt sophomore defensive 

tackle Bryan Mone, who missed 
all of last season with a broken 
leg, is back to 100 percent and 
practicing in full during spring 
camp.

In fact, he has been practicing 

since the team’s Citrus Bowl trip 
to Florida and believes he could 
have played in 
the game, but 
by sitting out, 
he saved an 
extra year of 
eligibility.

Seven 

months 
ago, 

Mone was in 
the 
middle 

of his second 
fall camp as a Wolverine and 
appeared ready to be in the 
rotation at defensive tackle as 
only a sophomore. When he went 
down with an injury last August, 
he didn’t initially think it would 
keep him out. He told head athletic 
trainer Paul Schmidt, “Just strap 
me up and I’m good to go!”

It wasn’t that simple, Schmidt 

told him. The leg began to swell 
up in the days after the injury, and 
Mone’s worst fears became reality.

“I really didn’t know it was 

going to be a season-ending 
injury,” he said.

He then spent the season on 

the sideline, watching Michigan’s 
defensive line grow into one of the 
best in the country. He said that 
having to watch the team play gave 
him extra motivation to get back 
on the field as quickly as he could.

“The thing that hurt me the 

most was not being able to help 
out the team, especially when 
we were struggling,” Mone said. 
“And of course, I’ve got too much 
love for the game of football. 
When you love something and it 
goes away, you’re heartbroken.”

After weighing 320 pounds 

at the start of last season, he has 
slimmed down to 309 and become 
faster as a result. He worked back 
into his routine in Florida because 
he wanted to get one last shot 
on the scout team against first-
teamers such as fifth-year senior 
center Graham Glasgow, and now 
he’s back and ready to go.

“I 
feel 

amazing,” 
he 

said. “I’m still 
a little rusty on 
little stuff like 
my technique, 
especially my 
feet and my 
hands. That’s 
what I need to 
fix the most, 

but I feel like I’m stronger, more 
explosive, faster.”

By the end of last season, 

with players such as Mone and 
defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow 
injured, the Wolverines were just 
trying to plug the gaps on the 
interior of the defensive line. Now, 
they’re back to having legitimate 
competition at those positions.

Even among the returning 

contributors, Mone has stuck 
out as a viable contributor.

“No rust at all,” said fifth-year 

senior 
defensive 
tackle 
Matt 

Godin. “He’s played really well.”

“I feel like I’m 
stronger, more 

explosive, faster.”

Poggi, Hill now at fullback

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

The last time Khalid Hill 

carried the ball in a game, he was 
10 years old and just learning how 
to play football.

The carry went for 60 yards 

— but not a touchdown — and 
it marked the final highlight of 
what Hill described as a “great” 
but brief career as a youth football 
running back.

Now a redshirt junior on the 

Michigan football team, Hill — 
recruited as a tight end by former 
coach Brady Hoke — may soon 
find the ball in his hands again. 
After a mutual decision between 
Hill and current head coach Jim 
Harbaugh, sparked in part by 
Hill’s performance as an injury 
replacement against BYU last 
season, Hill will move back off the 
line of scrimmage and transition 
to the fullback position this year.

He’s not alone in that regard 

— former defensive lineman and 
fellow redshirt junior Henry 
Poggi, who made the switch to 
offense last season and played 
several snaps at tight end, is 
also making a full-time move to 
fullback in 2016.

Though playing in the backfield 

versus on the line of scrimmage 
sounds fundamentally different 
on paper, tight ends and fullbacks 
don’t function that differently in 
Harbaugh’s offense, making the 
transition a little more seamless 
for two players with tight end 
experience. 

“They’re basically the same 

thing — the tight ends just run a 
lot more routes,” Hill said.

Hill, who previously stood tall 

on the line and focused on his 
routes, has worked extensively 
on playing lower and blocking 
in the backfield. And of course, 
matching up with players like 
senior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis and redshirt sophomore 
safety Jabrill Peppers instead of 

defensive linemen brings a new 
set of challenges.

“At fullback, you’re four or five 

yards deep in the backfield,” Hill 
said. “You come out of the backfield 
and either you’re in the hole or 
you’re going outside to block a 
guy. You’ve gotta worry about a 
DB or somebody who’s quick or 
agile — like Jourdan Lewis is one 
of the hardest players to block 
because he can 
move and dip, 
and Jabrill is 
another one.”

Neither 

Hill nor Poggi 
is 
averse 
to 

blocking, 
though. 
Harbaugh 
has 
regularly 

valued a hard-
hitting style in 
his fullbacks — his frequent usage 
of then-senior Sione Houma last 
season is a prime example — and 
the new fullbacks have been quick 
to embrace that mindset.

“There’s always gonna be some 

sort of physical play during it,” 
Poggi said. “I like that a lot. I like 
coming downhill and smashing 
skulls with guys. (We) get the 
ball, too, which is very nice 
— something that we’ve been 
working on.”

Such is another benefit of 

being a Harbaugh fullback — not 
only are they frequently used 

in 
blocking 

situations, but 
they get their 
fair share of 
touches as well. 
Last 
season, 

Houma 
and 

then-fifth-
year 
senior 

Joe 
Kerridge 

combined 
for 

57 carries, 246 
yards and six 

touchdowns. Houma had never 
run the ball or scored a touchdown 
in his first three years on the field 
at Michigan, but he became a 
go-to goal-line option last season, 

getting 43 carries and finding the 
end zone five times.

Hill and Poggi have zero 

combined career rush attempts 
between them, but that hasn’t 
deterred 
them 
from 
taking 

advantage of their chance to see 
the field. Kerridge and Houma 
have already laid out the model, 
and 
their 
successors 
know 

they’ll have plenty of chances to 
follow it.

“(Harbaugh) gives us a lot of 

opportunities,” Hill said. “He 
wants everybody out there to get 
their chance to go do something 
good. 

“I feel like replacing those two 

guys is gonna be tough, because 
they set a standard. Me and Poggi, 
(Bobby) Henderson, we’ve all 
been working to fill those steps 
that they had.”

After 10 years, Hill may not 

have another 60-yard run in 
him, but if recent history is any 
indication, he might just get 
another chance to make it to the 
end zone.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Redshirt junior Khalid Hill should find himself blocking more after moving from tight end to fullback this season.

“There’s always 
gonna be some 
sort of physical 
play during it.”

Blanco, Montemarano carry 
Wolverines to run-rule win

Michigan’s offense 
capitalizes late in 
rout of Western 
Michigan at home

By TYLER COADY 

Daily Sports Writer

As 
Michigan 
junior 
right-

hander Megan Betsa watched the 
ball land in right centerfield, the 
Western 
Michigan 
bench 
jumped 
to its feet. A new sense of life 
emanated in the Bronco dugout, 
but only for a fleeting moment.

Without 
hesitation, 
Betsa 

walked 
back 
to 
the 
circle, 

received a command from the 
Wolverine dugout, and tossed 
a first-pitch strike. Before long, 
Western Michigan’s Ivy Schaaf 
was trudging back to the dugout, 
as Betsa struck her out to put an 
exclamation point at the end of a 
dominant, one-hit performance.

“I think I did a really good job 

of staying in my process,” Betsa 
said. “I got rid of bad thoughts 
really quickly, which is something 
I haven’t done very well this 
season.”

Betsa’s 
14 
total 
strikeouts 

proved more than enough as the 
Michigan softball team (22-2) 
eased past the Broncos, 8-0, in 
six innings at Alumni Field on 
Thursday.

The second-ranked Wolverines 

started 
quickly 
as 
senior 

centerfielder 
Sierra 
Lawrence 

drew a walk and immediately 
stole second base.

With Lawrence in scoring 

position, senior shortstop Sierra 
Romero — who is hitting near 
.500 — ripped a double into the 
outfield to bring her home.

Whereas 
the 
Wolverines’ 

14-1 win over Eastern Michigan 
last week featured an outburst 
of runs in the early innings, 
the offense needed more time 
to click at the plate against 

Western Michigan (9-13).

“I thought we could have swung 

a lot better,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “I would like to 
see us be more attacking and hit 
the ball harder and farther.”

Junior third baseman Lindsey 

Montemarano 
answered 

Hutchins’ call. 
The 
junior 

has struggled 
with a batting 
average 
hovering 
below .200, but 
she 
rectified 

her problems 
against 
the 

Broncos.

With senior 

pinch runner 
Mary Sbonek on second base, 
Montemarano laced her fourth 
double of the season into left 
field to increase the Wolverines’ 
lead to 2-0.

“I think the biggest competitor 

for me is myself and my mind,” 

Montemarano said. “I’ve let that 
control too much because I want 
to do so well, so bad … but I need 
to remember the game doesn’t 
change, and playing at home 
allows (me) to calm down.”

With two outs in the third 

inning, 
Montemarano 
proved 

to be a timely 
hitter 
once 

again 
as 
her 

single 
scored 

senior 
right 

fielder 
Kelsey 

Susalla to make 
the score 4-0.

“Well, 

(Montemarano) 
had 
to 
start 

somewhere,” 
Hutchins said. 

“I told her today, ‘If you want your 
batting to go up, swing.’

“We just need her to be more 

aggressive, and I was really 
pleased she came out swinging at 
the first pitch.”

In the fourth inning, sophomore 

first baseman Tera Blanco, hitting 
a staggering .446, drove in the 
ever-on-base Romero and junior 
left fielder Kelly Christner.

With a six-run cushion and 

a no-hitter in hand, Betsa went 
back to work in the fifth and sixth 
innings. Strikeouts continued to 
pile up, and Michigan’s fielders 
had little reason to move. 

Though 
Betsa 
lost 
her 

no-hitter in the sixth inning, her 
commanding outing set the stage 
for a run-rule victory.

“A 
no-hitter 
is 
something 

difficult to do,” Betsa said. “It was 
just one hit, not anything major, so 
I just moved onto the next pitch.”

In the bottom of the sixth, 

freshman pinch hitter Natalie 
Peters started the inning with 
a single. Romero advanced on a 
fielder’s choice before making 
her way to second on an error. 
With runners on second and 
third, Blanco finished the game 
with a double that scored both 
Peters and Romero.

SOFTBALL
Betsa dominates, 
twirls one-hitter

By AVI SHOLKOFF 

Daily Sports Writer

Early this season, junior right-

hander Megan Betsa struggled to 
pitch to the level that made her 
an All-American last year with 
a 31-5 record and a 1.72 earned-
run average. She walked batters 
as often as she struck them out, 
struggling at times with her 
command and failing to get 
hitters out in important moments.

But on Tuesday at Alumni 

Field, Betsa seemed to put that 
behind her. She pitched a one-
hitter to help lead the No. 2 
Michigan (22-2) softball team 
to an 8-0 victory over Western 
Michigan (9-13).

Betsa dominated every facet 

of the game, allowing just two 
Broncos to reach base. After 
a marathon 10-pitch at-bat in 
which Western Michigan second 
baseman Melissa Palmer itched 
out a walk to lead off the game, 
Betsa retired the next 16 hitters 
she faced, striking out 12. She 
finished her outing with a season-
high 14 strikeouts, just two short 
of her career-best mark of 16. Part 
of Betsa’s success can be attributed 
to her extended rest in between 
starts — an eight-day period.

During this time, she continued 

her usual drills of spinning the 
ball and practicing pitching in the 
zone. Both Betsa and Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins explained 
that the Wolverines participated 
in a special activity this week 
because of their earlier-than-
usual game.

“We threw live this week at 

practice against our own hitters, 
(which is) always challenging,” 
Betsa said. “It’s a mentality thing, 
so I can get everything feeling 
right before I get out there.”

The drill certainly helped. 

From the first inning onward, 
she showed her authority from 
the circle.

Betsa had tremendous control 

of the Bronco lineup — of the 
20 batters she faced, she got two 
strikes on 17 of them. She also 

walked only one batter.

Betsa demonstrated poise in 

the circle, frequently battling 
with the offense as Western 
Michigan’s batters refused to go 
down easily.

“It feels nice to be able to throw 

that many pitches and (the hitters) 
see whatever differences they’re 
seeing and they’re getting their 
swings off and (I’m able to) get 
them fooled,” Betsa said. “That’s 
what I do best, fool hitters. My job 
is to spin it and make ‘em swing 
and miss.”

For Hutchins, it is imperative 

that Betsa to maintains her 
composure throughout the game. 
Should she lose it, she’ll struggle 
to find the zone.

In some earlier games this 

year, Betsa tended to fall behind 
in the count and failed to recover, 
causing unnecessary walks and 
base runners.

“The only time she gets herself 

in trouble is when she doesn’t 
have confidence or focuses on the 
hitter,” Hutchins said. “(Betsa) 
was clearly focused on her 
pitches today and that’s the kind 
of Megan that can have a lot of 
success for us.”

Betsa did not allow a hit 

through the first five innings and 
was one out away from her fourth 
career no-hitter until a two-out 
double by Palmer.

The Wolverines were well 

aware of Betsa’s special moment, 
and Hutchins sought to keep her 
in the game in order for her to 
reach the milestone. Sophomore 
right-hander Tera Blanco warmed 
up in the bullpen toward the end of 
the game, but Hutchins ultimately 
chose to leave Betsa in to finish.

Michigan should be excited 

that its top pitcher has returned 
to her All-American form as the 
Big Ten season begins on Friday.

Hutchins, for one, remains 

steadfast in her belief in Betsa.

“I have a ton of confidence in 

Megan,” Hutchins said. “The 
only concern I have is Megan’s 
confidence in Megan. That’s the 
only confidence that matters.”

Breakdown: Notre Dame

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 7 Michigan hockey 

team heads to Cincinnati to 
face off against Notre Dame in a 
first-round NCAA Tournament 
matchup on Friday.

It’s the first time the two 

ex-CCHA programs have met since 
the Wolverines were eliminated 
from 
postseason 
contention 

with a loss in that conference’s 
championship game in 2013.

The 
Fighting 
Irish 
(15-5-2 

Hockey East, 19-10-7 overall) are 
not so different than they were 
three years ago. They will pose a 
stringent defensive challenge to 
Michigan’s high-flying offense. 
The 
Wolverines 
(12-5-3 
Big 

Ten, 24-7-5) are the hotter team 
heading into the weekend after 
capturing the program’s first 
Big Ten Tournament title, but 
March hockey remains highly 
unpredictable.

The Daily breaks down the 

matchup:

Goaltending

Notre Dame ranks 14th in the 

nation with a 2.31 goals-against 
average, led primarily by standout 
goaltender Cal Petersen.

Petersen owns a top-15 save 

percentage — .928 — as well as the 
highest percentage of available 
minutes played among all Division 
I goaltenders — 98.5 percent. 
Drafted in the fifth round, Petersen 
was not considered a grade-A goalie 
prospect, but he has challenged 
that notion with a startlingly high 
level of play this season.

The 
sophomore 
improved 

his save percentage by 10 points 
from his first collegiate year and 
has been the foundation of Notre 
Dame’s success all season.

Michigan’s senior netminder, 

Steve Racine, has been decidedly 
less 
confidence-inspiring 
this 

year, but has elevated his play over 
the last two months. In the Big 
Ten Tournament, Racine stopped 
70 of 75 shots and made several 
big-time saves in the final against 
Minnesota.

Racine’s 
save 
percentage 

of .919 ranks just 41st among 
collegiate goaltenders. His play 
over the past few weeks has 
been enough to extinguish any 
lingering goalie controversy, but 
Petersen still takes the edge here 
with ease.

Edge: Notre Dame

Special Teams

Michigan’s power play has 

been clicking at unsustainable 
levels 
for 
nearly 
a 
month, 

creating some gaudy statistics. 
The Wolverines are converting 
31.8 percent of all power play 
attempts into goals on the 
season, and no opponent has 
been able to effectively disrupt 
Michigan’s extra-man attack in 
some time.

Notre Dame may have just 

the antidote, though, boasting a 
penalty kill that allows goals on 
just 16 percent of attempts. The 
even-strength defense is also 
prone to getting hot, allowing 
just 13 goals in eight games in 
the month of February. This is an 
elite defensive team, no matter 
the circumstance.

Both contenders are also 

respectable on the other ends 
of the special teams battle — 
though 
Michigan’s 
penalty 

kill has suffered over the last 
few weeks — but the contest to 
watch will be the Wolverines’ 
power play against the Fighting 
Irish kill.

Friday 
will 
answer 
what 

happens when an unstoppable 
force meets an immovable object. 
Whichever team emerges from 
that spectacular collision will 
likely be headed to the next round.

Edge: Push

Offense makes the best defense

Notre Dame is a stout defensive 

team, but it hasn’t played anyone 
quite like Michigan this season. 
The 
Wolverines 
lead 
college 

hockey with 4.89 goals per game 
— the highest average in 15 years.

No doubt about it — either team 

is going to need to score plenty in 
order to win this game. Even with 
Petersen’s impressive performance 
this season, a 2-1 contest seems 
exceedingly unlikely.

Perhaps the best indicator is the 

Fighting Irish’s non-conference 
tilts earlier this season with Big Ten 
foes Penn State and Minnesota. 
Notre Dame split both two-game 
series, conceding 19 total goals.

The Irish have shown an ability 

to post high goal totals on occasion, 
but it has been too rare to suggest 
an ability to match Michigan.

The clash of styles makes for an 

interesting guessing game, but it 
seems doubtful that Notre Dame 
will have much hope shutting 
down Hobey Baker frontrunner, 
freshman Kyle Connor and the 
rest of the CCM line.

The Fighting Irish do have a 

habit of jumping out to early leads, 
but will need offensive production 
of a scale not yet seen this season 
to compete with the Wolverines.

Edge: Michigan

Pick: Michigan 5, Notre Dame 3

Michigan and Notre Dame haven’t played since the 2013 CCHA title game, which the Fighting Irish won, 3-1.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Siera Thompson 
sets assists mark

Senior point guard 

breaks Jenny 

Ryan’s 2013 record

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

If there were any question as 

to Siera Thompson’s role on the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team, one look at the stat sheet 
Tuesday would leave no doubt. 
The junior guard was the hub of 
the Wolverines’ offense, dishing 
out assists left and right, and 
in the WNIT third round, she 
added to that legacy.

In the final three minutes of 

the first quarter of Michigan’s 
game against San Diego, two 
assists 
from 
Thompson 
to 

sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty 
pushed 
Thompson 

to 168 on the season and gave 
her sole possession of the 
Wolverines’ 
single-season 

record in the category.

“The way she controls the 

game for our team and the way 
she finds her teammates and 
the way she’s so unselfish in 
passing up open shots to make 
an easier shot and to make a pass 
is incredible,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “I just 
think she’s our floor leader and 
has an unbelievable amount of 
confidence with the basketball 
in her hands.”

The 
assists 
record 
was 

previously held by guard Jenny 
Ryan, who totaled 167 assists in 
the 2012-13 season.

Ryan went on to finish her 

time 
at 
Michigan 
ranking 

second on the program’s career 
list.

Along with her knack for 

finding open teammates and 
getting them the ball in a 
position to score, Thompson 

can step up and score when she 
needs to. She led the team with 
19- and 20-point performances 
in the first two WNIT games.

“I think that’s my maturity 

level over the years,” Thompson 
said. “I know, as a freshman, if 
I didn’t score as many points, 
I would be down or not be as 
effective on the court, and I 
think I’ve learned that it’s not 
about me, it’s about the team. 
So however I can help the team 
win, if that’s getting assists or 
stops, it doesn’t always have to 
be scoring for me.”

Thompson’s five assists on 

the night led the Wolverines, 
who totaled 20 in the contest 
and ended the game with 578 
on the season, surpassing the 
team’s 2014-15 season total and 
program record of 570. Flaherty 
and 
senior 
guard 
Madison 

Ristovski 
were 
just 
behind 

Thompson with four assists 
each against the Toreros.

“We definitely work on extra 

passes, just having the open shot 
and not the contested shot,” 
Thompson said. “We work on 
that as guards. I know the guard 
group works on that all the time, 
driving and kicking it, looking 
for open people.”

The 
team 
has 
greatly 

benefited this season from its 
ability to get the ball to a variety 
of different scoring options, led 
by Flaherty, who surpassed 100 
made 3-pointers on the season 
on 
Tuesday, 
and 
freshman 

center Hallie Thome, who was 
averaging 15.5 points per game 
this postseason heading into 
Tuesday’s game.

“I think that our assists are 

at a higher level because we 
have multiple people that can 
score the basketball,” Barnes 
Arico said. “And people are 
trying to make extra passes and 
find their teammates.”

Michigan routs San Diego

Wolverines win 
third straight to 
charge into WNIT 

quarterfinals

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Daily Sports Editor

It took the San Diego women’s 

basketball team two and a 
half minutes to score its first 
basket. 
By 

that point, 
though, 
it 

was already 
too late.

Behind an explosive first-

half 
performance 
Tuesday 

night, Michigan jumped out to 
a 22-point lead at the break by 
outshooting, outrebounding and 
outhustling the Toreros. In the 
end, the Wolverines earned a 
78-51 win and an entrance into 
the WNIT quarterfinals, where 
they’ll face either Ohio or Temple.

En route to the 26-point 

victory, Michigan showed that 
this year’s team — which is 
averaging 84.7 points in the 
postseason for the team’s fifth 
straight 20-win season, most 
wins at home (14) and most 
single-season assists (578) — 
may be best equipped to win a 
WNIT Championship.

With it, the program would 

hang its first banner.

“I was really happy with 

the way that we jumped on 
them,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “Our defense 
early on led to our offense. We 
pressured them, we made them 
feel uncomfortable and (we) 
were able to block out and get 
rebounds early and that led to 
some transition.”

That transition offense gave the 

Wolverines a quick 14-2 advantage, 
and their defense gave up just nine 
points in the first quarter. San 
Diego’s offense couldn’t generate 

anything without guard Malina 
Hood, whom junior guard Siera 
Thompson keyed in on right away.

Thompson 
dominated 
the 

one-on-one matchup, limiting 
Hood to five points and forcing 
her to commit three fouls in the 
first half, resulting in just 10 
minutes of playing time.

“Having her out was critical to 

our success,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We did a great job of attacking 
her early on and setting the tone 
and really drawing fouls. That 
was the difference in the game.”

With the Toreros’ all-time 

leading 
scorer 
and 
3-point 

shooter out of the picture early 
on, sophomore guard Katelynn 
Flaherty couldn’t be stopped for 
Michigan.

Flaherty, who finished with 

24 points, bounced back from 
her slow start against Bucknell 
on Saturday and came out firing 
on all cylinders against San 
Diego. With three 3-pointers, 
Flaherty 
surpassed 
100 
on 

the season, becoming just the 
second Wolverine to do so and 
joining Kate Thompson, who hit 

110 in 2012-13.

But 
it 
was 
Michigan’s 

impenetrable defense that fed 
into the offense’s success. The 
Wolverines outrebounded the 
Toreros, 25-14, on the defensive 
glass, minimizing San Diego’s 
second-chance 
opportunities. 

Sophomore 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston, junior guard Danielle 
Williams and freshman center 
Hallie Thome combined for 16 
boards, and the Toreros — whose 
tallest player is 6-foot-2 — didn’t 
stand a chance under the glass.

“We knew that they are pretty 

athletic and that they were 
gonna go after the board, and 
our block-outs were gonna be 
really important,” Barnes Arico 
said. “That was our number 
one goal today — to outrebound 
them. Rebounding was top on 
the list, and I thought we did a 
pretty good job of that.”

Late in the second half, 

though, Thome went up for a 
rebound and had her legs swept 
out from under her. She fell 
on her back, hit her head on 
the floor and took a minute to 

get up. After sinking two free 
throws, she came out for the 
rest of the game.

“It’s just scary when people 

fall that hard,” Flaherty said. 
“She’s OK, and I think she’s 
gotten a lot tougher this year in 
those situations and goes to get 
up and shake it off, so just I’m 
very proud of her.”

Luckily for Michigan, it had 

enough of a scoring cushion to 
play without her down the stretch. 
The explosive first half gave 
Michigan an overwhelming edge, 
making a San Diego comeback 
highly improbable. With 14 first-
half points each, Flaherty and 
senior guard Madison Ristovski 
led the Wolverines to shoot 64 
percent from the field and 80 
percent beyond the arc in the first 
20 minutes.

Better 
yet 
for 
Michigan, 

it was not only relentless for 
one half but for all 40 minutes 
— something the Wolverines 
struggled with in the beginning 
of the year but are now getting a 
grasp on in the postseason when 
it matters most.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 23, 2016


“

Oh, I edit, I don’t write,” is my standard response 
to any and all questions about what I do at The 
Michigan Daily. I fact-check and correct gram-

mar; those are my two responsibilities. Sure, as a 
whole, our section is responsible for upholding the 
integrity of the paper by making sure we don’t print 
incorrect facts or misspelled names. But functionally, 
most of my time is spent Googling obscure City Council 
members and deleting commas. Our section is one big 
group of grammar nuts generally confused as to how 
people are unable to conduct basic Internet research, 
full of bitter loathing every time we’re forced to delete 
an Oxford comma (bite me, AP, they’re important) 
and extremely well-versed in the art of leaving snarky 
copy notes that end in a passive-aggressive question 
mark to make them seem like suggestions. We’re too 
eloquent to be all that fun at parties, and our desk 
tends to be one of the more quiet ones in the news-
room. And I love it.

But every once in awhile I look up from whatever 

846th article about the deer cull I’m reading over and 
pause. I love it, but I also love the anonymity and the 
shield that accompanies it. I’m not the one with the 
opinions, and I’m not held accountable for anything. 
Second-handedly accountable, sure, but whatever mis-
print or other offense the public is up in arms about is 
always directed at the writer, not the editor. I avoid 
the dirty work and long hours and lounge in the safety 
net that comes from being able to sweep by and make 
everyone else’s opinions look pretty, and leave my own 
in their carefully guarded box. And the fact that I love 
that is a bit of an issue.

Because it’s not like I don’t have opinions, I just don’t 

like passing judgment on a subject until I feel as though 
I’ve been properly educated on it and have taken the 
time to think it through. I collect perspectives, hoard-
ing as many different opinions as I can to try to get a 
glimpse of the bigger picture. But a side effect of this 
is a crippling uncertainty, a barrage of options that 
does not lend itself well to being pared down. Look at 
it this way: I had some two months’ notice to write this 
article and yet here I am, writing it two hours before 
it’s due, because it took me two months to properly for-
mulate my opinions on not having opinions. And it’s 

not like the neutral is a valid option — I can’t decide if 
an “I don’t know” feels more like a cop-out or a neon 
dunce cap, although it most often best describes what 
I think. It’s not that I don’t have adequate information 
on the subject, but that I just don’t know which bit is 
most applicable to how I view the world. Needless to 
say, the gestation period tends to last longer than the 
duration of your average conversation, so I often find 
myself having to prematurely spit out half-formulated 
ideas that are graceless at best and offensive at worst.

But luckily, I don’t write. I think maybe I’ll just stick 

to my bubble and keep restructuring dangling parti-
ciples in peace.

Wednesday, March 23, 2016 / The Statement 

I 

don’t really like to tell people I’m an immigrant.

It’s not because I’m ashamed of my South Asian 

identity; this column is proof enough that I’m very 

much the opposite of that.

It’s because when, freshman year, I told my friend’s 

boyfriend that I can’t vote because I’m not an American 
citizen, the first thing he thought to say was, “Wow, you 
speak really good English.”

I speak English very well.

Ugh, of course. Even when I was being hit with a 

micro-aggression, the first thing I wanted to do was 
insufferably correct his grammar.

But I was too stunned to really say anything to him, 

and my friend, who was standing next to him red-faced, 
apologized to me later that day for his behavior. The 
apology didn’t matter, but I didn’t tell her that. 

“It’s fine!” I said. “It’s totally not a big deal.”
It was though. A big deal, I mean.

It was a big deal because in that 

moment I felt like I was 8 years old 
again, sitting alone in my 2nd grade 
classroom in Texas on the verge of 
tears because my classmates had 
made fun of the way I talked.

Or when I was put in the spe-

cial education classroom because I 
refused to speak and instead of find-
ing out why an 8-year-old girl had 
suddenly gone mute, my school had 
decided that the best thing to do was 
to isolate her even more.

Or when I would stand in front of 

the bathroom mirror, hidden from 
my parents, and practice sounding 
American.

Or when I would make up excuses 

every day to get sent to the school 
nurse’s office so that I could go home 
early.

Or when I would purposefully 

make myself trip up while reading 
paragraphs out loud from our text-
book, so that I could blend in with 
everyone else because they couldn’t 
get through a simple sentence with-
out needing help.

By the third grade, through diligent 

practice, I had modeled my elocution 
to be perfectly American and blended 
in seamlessly with other American 
kids. Things also improved when 
I moved to Michigan in fifth grade 
and I embraced Midwestern culture 

whole-heartedly.

My school district had the privilege of a diverse stu-

dent body — teachers, not so much, but that’s for another 
column — and I quickly made friends who, while not 
all immigrants, had a strong cultural identities. Soon, I 
didn’t feel like an immigrant — I was part of the South 
Asian diaspora, a subculture that thrived on auntie jokes 
and purchasing bootleg DVDs of Bollywood movies from 
a local Patel Brothers.

A culture that collectively agreed that dancing against 

the backdrop of East-West music remixes was the only 
socially permissible way to get involved in our rich his-
tory.

A culture that thrived on making cruel jokes at the 

expense of “fobs.”

In high school, when someone from India had moved 

to my suburban hometown, I said nothing when people 
made fun of the funny way he talked and the “weird” 
clothes he wore.

For a long time, I thought I’d disassociated myself from 

the unkind nature of the South Asian diaspora’s domi-
nant attitude. Instead, I focused on social movements 
that I thought deserved more support from our com-
munity — like #reclaimthebindi — and became acutely 
aware of our media underrepresentation, as well as the 
egregious acts of cultural appropriation that occur at our 
culture’s expense.

But then, in college, when someone complained about 

the “fobs” that hang out in North Quad, I said nothing.

The truth of the matter is, the diaspora at large, no 

matter how much we harp on and on about our struggles 
and cultural appropriation, will never understand what 
it feels like to be a South Asian immigrant.

It’ll never understand what it’s like to have someone 

laugh behind your back at everything you say, to have 
your credibility questioned in a professional environ-
ment simply because of the way you speak or dress, or 
to have your own people reject you just because you’re 
from a homeland from which they claim to have a proud 
heritage.

And until my friend’s boyfriend had reminded me, I’d 

forgotten these things too.

So yes, what he said was hurtful and aggravating, but, 

more than anything, it was humbling.

Milan Crawford is used to being the only Black girl in the room. She attended Cranbrook-

Kingswood, an elite, predominantly white private school in Bloomfield Hills. She was also 
competitive in swimming, a sport with notably few Black athletes.

But when on break during her freshman year, Crawford, now an LSA senior, told her family 

members that she had pledged Alpha Phi, one of the University of Michigan’s 16 Panhellenic 
sororities. In return, she remembers receiving looks of confusion.

Many of Milan’s family members were part of the National Pan-Hellenic Council, a historically 

Black Greek life council composed of nine fraternities and sororities known as the “Divine 9” on 
their respective college campuses.

Crawford is one of few minority women in her sorority and within the University’s Panhellenic 

community. Choosing to rush a Panhellenic sorority rather than one of the “Divine 9” was a 
personal decision that came down to her comfort and experience operating in predominantly 
white spaces — a multicultural choice many students on campus find themselves facing, even as 
Greek life considers ways to approach diversity and inclusion.

***

Diversity, or lack thereof, isn’t an isolated challenge on campus.
This past September, University President Mark Schlissel launched a Diversity, Equity 

& Inclusion Strategic Planning Initiative in an effort to improve the campus climate across 
every school and college. A Diversity Summit held this past November additionally served as 
a platform for students and faculty members to directly express their ideas and concerns they 
have surrounding issues of equity and inclusion on campus.

While the planning process is underway, with the release of official plans scheduled for 

Spring 2016, several programs have already jumpstarted the president’s push for an improved 
racial climate, resulting in visible improvements on campus.

One such program, the HAIL Scholars program, short for the High Achieving Involved Leader, 

seeks to improve the recruitment of economically disadvantaged, high-achieving students from 
throughout the state through increased resources and full-tuition scholarships. While minority 
enrollment increased this past year for the first time since 2005, diversity, equity and inclusion 
on campus is still a prevalent issue not only within academic and administrative spheres, but 
within the social one as well. Overall, underrepresented minority enrollment increased by 12.8 
percent, and the number of Black students increased by 4.82 percent.

The University’s Greek life community is one in particular slowly working to improve 

enduring racial divisions.

Twenty-five percent of this campus is involved in Greek life, and when the term “Greek life” 

comes to mind, activities such as the Mud Bowl, Winterfest and St. Fratty’s Day undoubtedly 
follow. Giant houses that line Hill Street and Washtenaw Avenue are common associations, but 

what many don’t realize is that these fraternities and sororities comprise just two of the four 
Greek councils on this campus.

Greek Life at the University is comprised of four groups: the Inter-Fraternity Council, the 

Panhellenic Council, the National Pan-Hellenic Council and Multi-Cultural Greek Council.

It’s been a tumultuous year for the University’s IFC/Panhellenic community following 

several ski trips gone awry last February. Mary Beth Seiler, who has been the director of Greek 
life at the University for the past 37 years, is also set to retire amid many reforms currently 
underway within the Greek community. Each reform is set to combat such campus issues as 
alcohol abuse, sexual assault, the relationship between the city’s police department and the 
campus community and diversity.

Seiler said there is no denying that racism was once present in Greek life.
“Historically, honestly, there has been discrimination,” Seiler said. “Absolutely. That’s why 

we have organizations that were founded as African American, Jewish, Catholic ... There was 
outright discrimination. Nobody can really deny that.”

She added that the disproportionate sizes of the separate Greek Councils pose a barrier to 

mixing and socializing between the councils. For instance, she says, a social event between a 
200-person Panhellenic sorority and a 30-person NPHC Fraternity might pose discomfort for 
minority students involved. In addition, IFC/Panhel’s Greek Week, one of their largest events, 
falls around many NPHC organizations’ Founders Days — an important, busy season of tradition 
within the NPHC community.

Nonetheless, Seiler said there has been a push within the past year to promote awareness 

of the separate councils and their unique traditions within each organization. This push starts 
with encouraging members of the four councils to attend the philanthropic, cultural and social 
events of the four different councils.

“Are we where we want to be? No, absolutely not,” Seiler said. She noted that she strives to 

improve relations and communication between the four councils, but that she also believes it’s 
important for them to maintain their own identities within such diversity, equity and inclusion 
efforts.

“When we find those times we can actually collaborate and do something together — that’s 

great, but the goal is not to do everything together necessarily,” Seiler said.

She went on to say that many people ask her about the inherent issue of inclusion in 

organizations historically founded for certain races, ethnicities and religions within the 
four councils. She explained that she believes the separate councils and individual Greek 
organizations that cater to specific identities are an important source of comfort for students of 
different backgrounds on campus.

“Not everybody wants to be in a 200-member sorority no matter what, so the fact that 

there are options is good,” Seiler said. “And I 
think, especially at Michigan, making your 
organization intentionally diverse — and some 
students feel like that’s what they should do 
— you know, they should reach out more to 
students with different identities, and while 
that may sound very noble, you have to realize: 
Well, maybe that’s not what they want.”

***

LSA senior Arnold Reed, a former Black 

Student Union speaker, said his NPHC 
fraternity, Kappa Alpha Psi, has been a source 
of comfort for him as a minority student on a 
campus with more than 43 thousand students, 
less than 5 percent of which are Black.

While both he and LSA senior Reid 

McManus, an LSA senior and former NPHC 
council president, said equity and inclusion 
between the four councils has gradually 
improved on campus over the past year with 
the creation of the Greek life task forces, they 
added that the University has a long way to go 
to achieve equity and inclusion.

Both Reed and McManus identified a 

general lack of awareness among the four 
councils as a major barrier between the 
organizations. The councils don’t mix often, 
they explained, due to a lack of knowledge of 
each other’s traditions and events.

Reed said he would specifically like to see 

more IFC/Panhel members demonstrating 

a willingness to learn about NPHC’s unique 
traditions, such as twirling canes — a tradition 
sacred to Kappa Alpha Psi.

“When people see that for the first time, 

they’re not really sure what to make of it,” Reed 
said. “But I appreciate the organizations who, 
when they see us do that, they’re respectful 
and they say ‘Hey, what do you call that? What 
is that? That’s really cool. What’s the history 
behind it?’ As opposed to, I’ve had other 
organizations when I’ve had it in my hand try 
and grab it.”

Reed added that NPHC has a strong history 

of reaching out to other minority groups on 
campus, as demonstrated by its 27th annual 
multicultural talents show “Night at the Set” 
held earlier this year.

“I think just on an exterior level people tend 

to feel more comfortable with people that look 
like them,” Reed said. “Nothing is necessarily 
wrong with that; however, our organization 
has tried to make its recruiting efforts very 
diverse ... I think it really just depends case by 
case.”

And 
while 
he 
understands 
some 

organizations 
within 
the 
four 
councils 

choose not to interact with other councils 
out of comfort, Reed says he is hopeful that 
members within each community don’t feel as 
though the opportunity to socialize with other 
councils isn’t there.

“Whether or not you choose to interact with 

each other across councils, I don’t want people 
feeling as if there’s a wall there,” Reed added.

McManus 
attributed 
the 
apparent 

separation between the four councils to 
potential differences in students’ motivations 
behind joining Greek organizations in the first 
place. NPHC, for instance, attracts students 
seeking to continue the legacy of their parents, 
aunts or uncles. Both McManus and Reed 
chose to join Kappa Alpha Psi because of the 
influence of family members who were also 
members on their own college campuses. IFC 

and Panhel, McManus said, is more of a social 
draw for students than one of culture and 
legacy.

McManus pointed out another potential 

social barrier between students across the 
University’s four councils: their pre-exposure 
to different races and ethnicities. McManus 
explained that, because he went to a diverse 
high school, he came to the University with 
a certain level of comfort operating in all 
different racial and ethnic communities, 
whereas some of his friends, in both NPHC and 
IFC/Panhel alike, attended schools dominated 
by a specific race.

“I don’t think there’s a divide in how we 

socialize with each other,” McManus said. “I 
think it’s that some people don’t know how, 
just because they haven’t had to or haven’t 
been exposed to it. I feel like a lot of the white 
students that come to this University — they 
don’t know about the organizations within the 
NPHC and what they can offer. It’s not their 
fault because they just haven’t been exposed 
to it.”

McManus also pointed out a stereotype he 

finds harmful that, he said, is often applied to 
men and women of color who choose to join 
IFC or Panhellenic organizations: that they 
don’t want to be within their culture.

“A lot of people say ‘Oh, they’re washed. 

They don’t wanna be with their culture,’ 
” McManus said. “But I mean, I’ve talked 
to them, and they’re actually really cool 
individuals. They just decided that’s what they 
wanna do just because they grew up around 
not really knowing the African-American 
community.”

In reference to the stereotype, McManus 

added: “I don’t like that. A lot of my friends are 
white, and if I had joined an IFC fraternity I 
wouldn’t want that.”

***

Looking back on her time at the University, 

Crawford says her experience as a member of 
Alpha Phi was only positive. She said she feels 
fortunate she has never experienced instances 
of racism as a minority woman in a Panhellenic 
sorority.

She did, however, say that national headlines 

following instances of cultural appropriation 
and racism in Greek organizations — both at 
the University and on other college campuses 
— upsets her. In 2013, for instance, the 
University’s chapter of Theta Xi planned to 
hold a “ratchet” themed party, complete with 
an offensive Facebook event description and a 
photo that parodied Black culture.

“You hear that and you’re just like ‘Why 

the hell would I wanna join or be a part of 
anything like that?’ ” Crawford said. “And it 
makes sense. I don’t know how you change an 
entire culture.”

“It’s kind of opened my eyes, and I don’t 

wanna say that I’ve been ignorant this whole 
time, but I’m starting to see things and realize 
that ‘OK, I understand that I’m the only African 
American in my pledge class or chapter, but 
how can I use that to educate my peers?’ ” 
Crawford said. She added that, as a woman of 
color operating in an overwhelmingly white 
space, she often feels lacking in a space for 
open dialogue.

“When things like that tend to come up I’m 

silent — and I don’t like that I’m like that,” 
Crawford said. “I’m not very open about 
throwing my opinions on people, but when 
things like that come up, I feel like me speaking 
up can give my friends a new perspective, but 
I guess I’m not comfortable having those types 
of conversations around them.”

On the topic of diversity, equity and inclusion 

efforts on campus, Crawford says she sees 
significant room for improvement within the 
IFC/Panhel community. She recalled telling 
her mother she was excited after seeing three 
or four girls of color walk through the Alpha 
Phi house during a recent formal recruitment 
process.

“I wish that it was something that wasn’t so 

rare. It’s slowly but surely getting better, but 
there needs to be so much more that’s done,” 
Crawford said.

Crawford echoed McManus’ thoughts on a 

severe lack of education and awareness among 
IFC/Panhel organizations of the traditions 

and events of MGC and NPHC organizations. 
For instance, she said she believes a mandatory 
community meeting, held earlier this year by 
Schlissel to address issues of alcohol abuse, 
sexual misconduct and other issues that have 
put Greek life at the center of attention both 
on campus and across the nation, was the first 
time members of all Greek life organizations 
came together.

She added that the IFC/Panhel could 

significantly benefit from increased interaction 
with the MGC and NPHC communities. 

“There’s 
just 
so 
many 
different 

perspectives,” Crawford said. “You learn 
so much from someone who is completely 
different from you. There’s people from so 
many different backgrounds and so many 
different cultures and so many races and I feel 
that Panhel and IFC is very closed off to that 
and I think it’s a problem.”

To minority women thinking of rushing 

Panhellenic sororities, Crawford highlighted 
confidence and self-awareness as crucial 
pieces of advice.

“Always make sure that you’re confident 

in yourself,” Crawford said. “When you hear 
these disgusting things in the news, and you 
hear these headlines, and you hear what’s 
going on and you’re hearing about the Black 
Lives Matter movement, it’s really easy in a 
situation where you are the minority to start 
not to be self-aware and you start feeling 
uncomfortable and feeling judged. It’s really 
easy for that to happen.”

A

s a kid, I convinced myself that I had “almost-
insomnia.” Every night I would melodramati-
cally toss and turn, my body tired but my mind 

whirring on. Unlike an actual insomniac, I would 
always fall asleep, usually only one or two hours 
after I had first climbed into bed. But as a bored kid 
growing up with an astonishingly comfortable life, I 
loved to create my own problems.

So I told myself I was an insomniac. While my 

physician father recommended actual physiologi-
cal solutions to my problem — drink less water at 
night, don’t read in bed, exercise more — I was too 
impatient. I started telling myself stories, fantastical 
imaginations of my future. It became a strange pat-
tern; I would stay up late the first time I created a 
story, planning and executing an elaborate tale. The 
nights thereafter I would retell it to myself, the com-
fortable familiarity of my own fiction lulling myself 
to sleep.

I wouldn’t create stories of fantasy or magic; no 

princesses or dragons dotted my dreams. Instead — 
in perhaps the first indication of the self-indulgent 
pragmatist I would become — I was always the cen-
ter of the story, and they were always closely realis-
tic fictions of what I hoped my life to become.

When I was 10, obsessed with “Footloose” and 

with dreams of becoming an elementary school 
teacher, I pretended that as a teenager I would meet 
Kyra Sedgwick (yes, “The Closer”) in a park with 
her two children. You see, her husband Kevin Bacon 
would be filming a movie in the area, and Kyra would 
be so taken with me that she’d insist that I babysit 
their kids, even bringing me to glamorous Los Ange-
les for the summer.

When I was 15, prone to unrequited crushes and 

an incessant love of Harry Potter, one particular 
story took hold. I was in my twenties, living in Lon-
don, single and successful and empowered, when I 
was called into a meeting with Daniel Radcliffe, and 
asked to manage his charity. The specifics of the 
charity were unclear, but our love affair was fully 
fleshed out, the details developed and redrawn as 
I fell asleep each night. I found security in these 
details, in taking these admittedly impossible ven-
tures and grounding them in the day-to-day. Dan-
iel and I would live in the city but spend a month 
each summer at my parent’s Lake Michigan cottage. 
I would become beloved by the Brits for my sweet as 
pie American goodness, but would personally strug-
gle with a life in the public eye.

I knew these creations could never be real, but 

developing these worlds slowed my mind down 
enough to let me sleep. In real life, I wasn’t flashy 
or popular. While I was a happy person, my day-to-
day life was free of much excitement. In my fresh-
man yearbook, someone wrote that I “seemed nice 
and smart.” When I ran for student council, a friend 
overheard a boy asking, “Who’s Natalie Gadbois?” 
Another girl answered, “You know, that nice girl 
who looks like Matilda.” My best friend’s mom told 
me I would “blossom” in college, and I internalized 
that concept, believing that when my time came, it 

would be spectacular. I was OK with being known 
as just that nice, smart girl, because I looked ahead 
to my own exciting future. It thrilled me what wild 
machinations my future could hold. I just had to 
wait, and to dream. Hence, the stories.

They continued as I grew older, even as I entered 

college, and I did seem to blossom, my life really 
becoming exciting and adventurous. But the futures 
I created always held more — places to go and peo-
ple to fall in love with and jobs to have. The stories 
became more realistic, or at least more grounded in 
my personal reality: rekindling a romance in some 
warm, far-away city with a friend I had long had 
feelings for; moving to a big city, meeting exciting 
men at book parties and museums; quitting a corpo-
rate job and developing a television show with a best 
friend. As recently as six months ago, there was still 
a joy in charting the infinite paths my twenties could 

take.

Now, I find it harder and harder to fall asleep, and 

these stories almost become menacing. I’m lucky 
that as a graduating senior I know where I’m work-
ing and living after college ends. I know that I am 
lucky, and I’m excited. But I’m also terrified. All 
these years of imagining, of creating an adult future, 
of dreaming of blossoming. All the possible imagi-
nations of my future that I’ve cultivated for years 
are funneling into one actionable reality. My future 
is being anchored in ways I never envisioned. I’m 
going West; I always thought I would go East. I’m 
working the corporate job Natalie Gadbois-Radcliffe 
would have scoffed at. The close friends that accom-
panied my exploits are all moving in the opposite 
direction from me. In college, I blossomed. Some-
times I’m afraid in adult life I’ll wilt — or, at least, 
that I won’t live up to my dreams.

by Alyssa Brandon,
Daily News Editor

“Dipped in chocolate, bronzed in elegance, enameled with grace, toasted with 

beauty. My Lord, she’s a Black woman.”

I read this quote often — one of my favorite quotes from Yosef A.A. Ben-Jochan-

nan — and when I do, it makes me feel positive and confident about who I am. I 
read this quote and I want to take a deep breath and yell from my chest that I am 
a confident, complex and phenomenal Black woman.

Funny thing is, I don’t get to really do that so much in my writing.
In fact, I’d have to say this is honestly the first time I’ve been able to be forth-

coming about being Black in my writing. You see, as a news journalist for The 
Michigan Daily, I feel like I never get the chance to share that nugget of informa-
tion with my readers — or that I’m really supposed to for that matter.

Of course, that may lead one to ask why the fact that the person writing this 

article happens to be Black matters in the first place. 

I myself hadn’t really thought about that until a few weeks ago, when an associ-

ate at the Daily told me her professor had incorporated an article I wrote, which 
was about a campus event dealing with intersectionality within the Black com-
munity, into a mandatory course for students on residential staff. My associate 
told me that during a class discussion on the article, one of her classmates said 
she thought the author, meaning me, probably didn’t know what she was talking 
about since she’s not even Black. Of course, you can imagine the look on every-
one’s faces when my associate kindly corrected her, and shared with the class that 
I am indeed, Black.

After she told me what happened, the first thing that came to mind was, “Great! 

She couldn’t tell I was Black, so there’s no way she can think I was being biased in 
my article!” But then, I thought, how can I really be OK with this? This girl com-
pletely misidentified me. Not only that, but because she misidentified me, she was 
critical of my credibility as a journalist. Is this really what I want my readers to do? 
Am I really all right with my identity being hidden and misunderstood like this?

Being the journalist that I am, I did some searching to try to find some answers. 

Of course, as usually tends to happen, I realized the issue here is much deeper.

Let me start by saying, I really can’t blame this girl for thinking I’m not Black. 

I’m the only Black student involved in the News section.

Not to mention the name Alyssa doesn’t exactly scream, “She’s black!” What 

can I say? My mom loved Alyssa Milano in “Who’s the Boss?” So, I can see how 
she was able to think I’m not Black. That makes sense to me. The part that’s really 
leaving me puzzled is how the conclusion that I wasn’t Black was used to argue 
that my work wasn’t credible. In fact, I’ve learned that it’s supposed to be quite 
the opposite.

Ethical journalism standards have taught me that I have to suppress parts of my 

identity in order to remain objective in my work. I’ve learned my job as a journal-
ist who sometimes writes about the Black community requires me to suppress my 
identity as a Black woman in order to be unbiased. Why? Well, as our friend in 

that residential staff course inadvertently showed, my identity as a Black woman 
apparently makes a big difference when it comes to the objective quality of my 
work.

The principles of objective journalism and their popular perception made me 

feel that because I’m Black, I will inevitably agree with every Black person I 
interview for my articles. It made me feel that I will always vote for the candi-
date that promises to do the most for the Black community. It made me feel that 
I can’t always write about things related to diversity on campus because I will 
identify too much with some of the students of color I may need to interview for 
the story. Objective journalism made me feel that being Black means I’m going 
to be too opinionated, so when I write, I should strive to be just a name on a page 
with no interests, no passion and certainly no identity.

Objective journalism taught me that if I truly want to be unbiased in my writ-

ing, then I absolutely cannot be Black.

It didn’t take long for me to realize that this way of thinking about ethical 

journalism standards was all wrong. All Black people don’t have the same expe-
riences. All Black people don’t support the same political candidates. All Black 
people don’t agree on every issue. I cannot accept that being Black is code for a 
specific set of beliefs, experiences and interests that I must lay aside for the sake 
of being ethical.

My identity is much more complex than just being a Black woman; being 

Black is who I am, but it doesn’t completely define my views, my interests or my 
experiences. I respect ethics and I understand my responsibility as a journalist 
to share nuanced and objective information with my community, but I just can’t 
bring myself to believe that being Black makes my coverage of specific issues 
biased.

Am I a writer who happens to be a Black woman or am I a Black woman who 

happens to be a writer? I don’t know, and I may never know. I do know that I 
love to write and when I’m writing is when I really feel like I’m being myself and 
doing something that really matters. I hope one day, my readers will be able to 
appreciate me for the Black woman that I am and glean my passions and inter-
ests from my writing.

So with that, for the first time, let me introduce myself to you. My name is 

Alyssa Brandon. I am from Romulus, Michigan and I am a junior studying com-
munication studies and Japanese language and culture. I love romance novels, 
American history, sushi, travel and a nice, hot cup of green tea with a shot of 
steamed lemonade every now and then. I’m a woman who has had many strug-
gles, but I believe there are many victories in store as I discover my true assign-
ment for the world.

And, I’m Black, dipped in chocolate, bronzed in elegance, enameled with 

grace, toasted with beauty. My Lord, I’m a Black woman.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
