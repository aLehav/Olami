occurred between 1:45 a.m. and
2:15 a.m. on Oct. 30 in East Quad
Residence Hall and released on
Wednesday photographs from a

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
Network to connect public
universities with businesses

Six institutions
in Michigan to
participate in new
collaboration
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Several public universities
in Michigan are joining forces
with businesses across the
state in a new collaborative
association.
Six public universities,
including the University of
Michigan Ann Arbor and
Dearborn campuses, have
joined together to create the
Michigan Corporate Relations
Network - an effort that will
connect industry leaders with
academic talent at state uni-
versities. The universities were
selected because of the wide-
spread research conducted at
the intuitions and the diverse
geographic backgrounds of the
students and faculty.

In the 2011 fiscal year, the
University spent $1.24 billion
on research - an 8.5-percent
increase from the previous
year.
The network will receive
$1.8 million in funding from
the Michigan Economic Devel-
opment Corporation, and
the Michigan Strategic Fund
Board, organizations that
promote economic growth in
Michigan. The goals of the
network include creating or
further developing business
engagement offices at the insti-
tutions, establishing an online
search function for private
businesses to find faculty to
aid in corporate research and
expanding small businesses'
access to university libraries.
Michael Finney, Michigan
Strategic Fund chairman and
CEO of the MEDC said that the
network will help foster turn-
ing more campus innovations
into success.
"Michigan is one of the
top states in the nation for
research and development

with more than $16 billion in
industrial R&D and close to $2
billion in university research,"
said Finney, former Ann Arbor
SPARK CEO, in a Nov. 10 Uni-
versity press release. "Com-
panies like Google, Facebook
and Dell were born on college
campuses and we want to keep
helping our leading universi-
ties turn the latest develop-
ments into jobs."
Daryl Weinert, executive
director of the University's
Business Engagement Center,
said the network allows the
University to put a larger focus
on relationships between busi-
ness and academia.
"We benefit in ... getting
this network of offices that
really can take forward more
comprehensive and really ben-
eficial relationships between
University and then academia
around the state," Weinert
said. "That's going to be good
for the whole state of Michi-
gan, which is certainly good for
the University of Michigan."

Twitter, Facebook change
the nature of 2012 campaign

GOP debate watchers
take to Twitter after
Rick Perry mishap
NEW YORK (AP) - Rick
Perry had barely gotten through
his gaffe in Wednesday's Repub-
lican primary debate when a
rolling commentary on the TV
screen declared his campaign on
life support.
"Perry is done," came a Twit-
ter posting from a viewer called
(at)PatMcPsu, even while the
Texas governor struggleddto
name the third of three federal
agencies he said he would elimi-
nate as president. Another, called
(at)sfiorini, messaged, "Whoa?
Seriously, Rick Perry? He can't
even name the agencies he wants
to abolish. Wow. Just wow."
Perry insists his campaign
isn't over and has vowed to move
on from his meltdown.
One used to have to wait
for several minutes after the
debate ended for analysis of the
2012 presidential contest. But

if Wednesday's exchange is any
indication, social networking
has become the instant pundit-
ry: The 140-character messages
known as tweets came from
ordinary viewers and prominent
campaign strategists alike.
Social networking sites like
Twitter and Facebook have long
been hotbeds of political con-
versation, largely for an insider
crowd of activists and news
junkies. But CNBC, which aired
the debate, took things a step
further, featuring an onscreen
crawl of tweets from viewers
reacting to what was transpiring
onstage. That allowed ordinary
viewers to chime in on the politi-
cal conversation and an even
larger audience.
Social media provides "a real
time citizen voice," according
to Matthew Nisbet, an associate
professor of communications at
American University who stud-
ies politics and digital media.
"It's no longer a passive
audience experience, watch-
ing commentators and political
strategists discussing what is

being seen on the screen," Nis-
bet said. "Now people can hear
it from a more diverse range
of voices, and potentially from
their peers."
CNBC spokesman Brian Steel
said the network, which spe-
cializes in business and finan-
cial news and runs a continuous
stock ticker, viewed social media
as a natural partner for the
debate.
"During business hours CNBC
is focused on providing real-time
data analysis and information, so
social media was a great way to
work in real-time reaction to the
debate. It's very consistent with
what we do," Steel said.
The network had chosen a
mix of citizen tweets to feature
onscreen along with those from
"influencers" like former Gener-
al Electric Chairman Jack Welch
and Larry Sabato, a University
of Virginia professor and well-
known political commentator,
Steel said.
CNBC even posted a tweet
from (at)BarackObama, the pres-
ident's re-election Twitter feed,
where campaign staff tweeted
their reactions to the debate.
"'Obamacare' and 'repeal'
are tied for the most men-
tions at the second commercial
break," the post said.
To be sure, there were far
more tweets and mentions
of the debate on other social
media than those that actually
appeared on TV.
Bluefin Labs, a Cambridge,
Mass., social analytic compa-
ny that tracks digital chatter
around television, found there
were almost 275,000 social
media mentions of the CNBC
debate as it was underway.
That was second only to the
October 18 CNN debate, which
drew more than 548,000 men-
tions.
By comparison, the Fox
comedy Glee, which draws
more social media commen-
tary than any other show on
television this season, aver-
ages about 189,000 mentions
per episode.

Katsav to become
highest Israeli official
to go to prison
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's
Supreme Court yesterday upheld
the rape conviction of former Pres-
ident Moshe Katsav and ordered
him to begin serving a seven-year
prison term next month, a land-
mark decision that culminated a
sordid five-year saga.
The rape conviction for the
former head of state was hailed
as a victory for women's rights
and equality under the law, par-
ticularly at a sensitive time when
Israel's liberal democracy has
come under assault from extreme
nationalists and the burgeoning
ultra-religious minority.
"From this day on, let nobody
dare claim that these are women
who tried to conspire against the
president. Rather they are brave
women who must empower all
harassed women who are afraid
to complain," said Tzipi Livni,
Israel's opposition leader and the
nation's most prominent female
politician.
It also completed the tragic
ending for a man whose rag-
to-riches story had served as a
symbol of success for Mizrahi
Jews, those of Middle Eastern

descent who for decades were an
underclass in Israel. Ordered to
report to prison on Dec. 7, Kat-
say becomes the highest-ranking
Israeli official to serve time.
The Iranian-born Katsav, 65,
was convicted last December of
raping a former employee when he
was a Cabinet minister and of sex-
ually harassing two other women
during his term as president from
2000 to 2007. He received a sev-
en-year prison sentence in March,
but remained free pending his
appeal.
Katsav has vociferously pro-
fessed his innocence since the
accusations against him first
emerged five years ago, claiming
he was the victim of a political
witchhunt. And the case against
him depended entirely on testi-
mony, fueling a debate in Israel on
the difficulties of prosecuting sex
crimes.
But in a decisive ruling yester-
day, the judges said his testimony
had not been credible and accused
him of exploiting his status as a
high public official.
The former president "fell
from the loftiest heights to the
deepest depths," Judge Salim
Joubran told the hushed court.
"Such a senior official should be
a role model to his subordinates.
Every woman has a right to her
own body. A right to dignity. A

right to freedom. No one has the
liberty to take any of those from
her."
Katsav sat stone-faced
throughout the session, briefly
smiling wryly as it became clear
his appeal was beingrejected.
Katsav's attorney, Avigdor
Feldman, faulted the judges for
believing the rape victim despite
serious holes in her testimony.
"They would have believed her
if she said the rape occurred on
Venus," Feldman said.
Noya Rimalt, an expert on crim-
inal law and feminist legal theory
at Haifa University, said the pros-
ecution prevailed in because of
strong witness testimony. "Differ-
ent women who didn't know each
other told similar stories about the
way he treated female subordi-
nates. That is what the conviction
was based on," she said.
Israel's presidency is a largely
ceremonial office, typically filled .
by a respected elder statesman
expected to rise above politics
and serve as a moral compass.
The case against Katsav, which
broke in 2006 after he told police
one of his accusers was trying to
extort money from him, shocked
Israelisbyportrayinga manwide-
ly seen as a bland functionary as
a predatory boss who repeatedly
used authority to force sexual
favors.

The head of Michigan's new

Plans had been to serve about

Attackers blow up
Egyptian gas line
S Attackers set off explosives
along a gas pipeline in Egypt's
Sinai Peninsula that transports
fuel to neighboring Israel and
Jordan early yesterday, Egypt's
state news agency MENA report-
ed.
It was the seventh attack on
the pipeline since the popular
uprising ousted longtime Egyp-
tian leader Hosni Mubarak in
February.
The report on MENA said
unidentified assailants placed
explosive charges in two sepa-
rate places on the line that trans-
ports natural gas near the north
Sinai town of el-Arish, causing
blasts and huge fires. The explo-
sions forced a shutdown and halt-
ed exports to Jordan and Israel.
But later, a Sinai security
official said there was only one
explosion yesterday on the pipe-
line. He said the attackers blew
a hole in an underground part of
the pipeline, causingless damage
than in past attacks, which most-
ly targeted pumping stations.

going to be a tough slog."
Eleveld returned to her alma
mater last night to speak to stu-
dents aboutherfirsthandexperi-
ences inthe world ofWashington
politics and the contemporary
progressive movement. In MSA
Chambers in the Michigan
Union surrounded by about 20
antendees, Eleveld discussed
LGBT rights, which she said
have not made enough headway
in the nation's capital.
Washington is "way behind"
in LGBT equality perspectives,
Eleveld said, more so than the
American public because poli-
ticians are reluctant to make
radical changes and distinguish
themselves as leaders in LGBT
rights.
However, the reluctance of
politicians to stand up for LGBT
rights alone doesn't character-
ize issues of the contemporary
progressive movement, Eleveld
said. Environmentalism, social
justices and reproductive rights
are a few facets of the movement
that haven't been adequately
addressed in American politics
NETWORK
From Page 1
Weinert added that the Uni-
versity has been at the fore-
front of corporate engagement.
"(It's) partly a testament to
the fact that the University of
Michigan has shown the lead-
ership on this front, and it's
very fulfilling to see that taken
forward to additional institu-
tions across the state," Weinert
said.
Charles Hasemann, execu-
tive director of Business-
CONNECT, the business
engagement office at Michigan
State University, said the net-
work is especially beneficial
to the University of Michigan-
Dearborn, Michigan Techno-
logical University and Western
Michigan University because
these schools didn't previously
have business develop-

either, she said.
Eleveld contrasted journal-
ists' pursuitofthe truth to politi-
cians, whose campaign promises
are influenced by which groups
provide them the most funding,
she said.
"Our Washington advocates
or organizations are not get-
ting the job done," Eleveld said.
"The individual activists are the
ones holding our government
accountable."
However, the LGBT commu-
nity is taking strides to educate
and motivate citizens whether
they're in Washington D.C. or on
the Diag, Eleveld said. Shedding
light on shadowed issues isn't
easy, but it's not impossible, she
added. Eleveld noted the repeal
of the U.S. Military's 'don't ask,
don't tell' policy - which banned
gays from openly serving in the
military - as one of the several
achievements LGBT activists
have made in the last 18 months.
"There's a long way to go, but
I feel like the pastyear and ahalf
has been incredibly significant,"
she said.
Helen Fox, professor of
human rights in the Univer-
sity's Residential College, said
before yesterday's forum, she
thought LGBT issues were easy
ment offices. Wayne State Uni-
versity is also involved in the
collaboration.
"It will be a really nice tool
for connecting - in a really cool
and informative way - what is
it that we have at the univer-
sities both in terms of faculty
and just resources," Hasemann
said.
He added that the network's
focus on small businesses is

"One of the hallmarks of
small companies is that they
don't have a lot of money.
They're trying to make their
way," Hasemann said. "While
they would love to work with

have deep pockets that's hard,
so this money will subsidize
that relationship."

"(Eleveld) really showed how
these issues take a tremendous
amount of work, and not only

She added that while the mil-

do more to make greater social
impacts.
"(Students should) delve into

LSA junior Ethan Hahn, chair

The first program is designed
to help small businesses devel-

of the universities. The second

sation for students to intern or
work with small businesses in
the STEM - science, technol-

Hasemann explained that
the entire state will benefit
from the collaborative work of
the businesses and universities

incident likely caused the stu-
dent's hesitation to report it, and
DPS did not issue a crime alert
due to the delay in the reporting.
"We didn't perceive that by
the time we had the informa-
tion there still was a threat to
the community's safety," Brown
said. "But that did not stop us
from investigating because we
do want to hold this person
accountable."
After obtaining security foot-
age, DPS officials conducted
an investigation and internal-
ly shared pictures of the man
believed to be connected with
the sexual assault, Brown said.
However, DPS could not identify
the suspect and decided to share
the evidence with the public.
"At this point we are releas-
ing them more broadly so that
perhaps members of our broad-
er community might be able to
assist in that identification,"
Brown said.
Brown could not confirm
whether police have received
any tips since the pictures have
been released. She added that
no similar incidents have been
reported to DPS since the stu-
dent contacted the police.
Brown said the incident is
"not at all" related to the string
of sexual assaults that occurred
throughout Ann Arbor last
summer. AAPD Chief Barnett
Jones also said the East Quad
incident isn't related to previ-
ous assaults.
Residents and employees of
East Quad were upset about the
11-day period between the inci-
dent and the e-mail notifying
them of the assault.
LSA freshman Melissa Free-
land said the decision to post-
pone notification to residents
was "ridiculous," and students
should have been given some
type of warning immediately
after the crime was reported.
"I think that this should be
something they send an emer-
gency alert about," Freeland
said. "East Quad has always
seemed like such a safe place ...
(I am) a little more nervous now.
(This is) something to be careful
about."
Freeland said she will begin
taking additional safety precau-
tions in the residence hall at
night, like making an effort to
stay with other students at all

times.
University Housing officials
organized a meeting in East
Quad yesterday to provide stu-
dents the opportunity to meet
with Brown, DPS Lt. Bob Larry
and representatives from the
University's Sexual Assault Pre-
vention and Awareness Center
and Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services.
About 20 female students
attended the meeting and
addressed the lack of security on
the residence hall's first floor and
DPS's decision to delay notifying
students of the incident.
Several students called for the
installation of additional Mcard
readers to secure doors within
the building. Brown and Larry
suggested that students keep
curtains and windows closed
and refrain from holding the
building's main doors open for
people waiting to get inside.
Kelly Pearson, a graduate stu-
dent in the School of Social Work
and an East Quad resident advi-
sor, said she plans to hold a meet-
ing with University Housing
security officers for her residents
to attend.
"I'm living on the ground
floor, (and) a few of my residents
were at the meeting tonight and
were concerned," Pearson said.
"I'm setting up (another) secu-
rity meeting to ensure my resi-
dents feel safe."
Brown said DPS currently sta-
tions Housing security officers
in each residence hall to ensure
a quick response should an inci-
dent arise. Officer protocol in the
residence halls will not change
in wake of the sexual assault, she
added.
"Housingsecurity will contin-
ue to do the things they've been
doing well; (which is to) be able
to build awareness of risk reduc-
tion techniques," Brown said.
"I'm sure the Housing security
staff will be focused on provid-
ing that because that's one of
their significant functions."
Engineering freshman Scott
Wigler said he is satisfied with
the security presence in East
Quad, but thinks officers should
spend more time in certain areas
of the building.
"DPS walks around my hall
a lot, but there's never a DPS
officer-by the entrance (of the
building), so I think they should
increase that," Wigler said.

enter the crosswalk, but it also
provides drivers with much-
needed clarity as to whenthey're
obligated to stop for pedestri-
ans," Taylor said.
Council member Carsten
Hohnke (D-Ward 5) noted that
the original ordinance was
drafted as a result of a two-year
research project and public
input. He advised the council to
be careful when alteringthe law.
"It's useful to make sure that
we keep in mind what we're try-
ing to accomplish here, which is
... to ensure the safety of pedes-
trians," Hohnke said, adding
that pedestrians should not be
asked to risk "life and limb" to
use a crosswalk.
Hohnke said he wasn't sure if
the amendment addresses citi-
zens' concerns. He said he wants
to leave the text of the ordinance
unchanged.
"I'm much more confident
in the language we earlier had,
and it's not clear to me that this
addresses any particular chal-
lenge that we have," Hohnke
said. "We're simply shifting the

burden of discretion to the weak-
er party to which the heavier
machines should be yielding."
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje said he believes the amend-
ment offers clarification of the
ordinance.
"We may have thought that
'approaching' was a term that
had been used in other places
and was working well," Hieftje
said. "Obviously not everyone
considered it that same way."
He added that input from
community members has been
particularly helpful to deter-
mine how to alter the ordinance.
While answering questions
from council members last night,
Ann Arbor Police Chief Barnett
Jones noted that from Sept. 18
to Nov. 1 about 30 accidents in
Ann Arbor involved pedestri-
ans or bicyclists using a cross-
walk. Though many residents
have attributed several rear-end
accidents to drivers' confusion
regarding the ordinance, Jones
said pedestrians are not at fault
for suchcollisions.
In the public commentary
section of the meeting, Architec-
ture and Urban Planning gradu-
ate student Joel Batterman, vice
chair of the Washtenaw Bicy-

cling and Walking Coalition,
praised the current pedestrian
ordinance.
"The ordinance is working,"
Batterman said. "A few months
of education and enforcement
will dramatically increase the
proportion of folks stopping for
pedestrians on our streets."
Batterman, also a Michigan
Daily columnist, said local media
outlets have attributed rear-end
crashes on Plymouth Road near
North Campus directly to the
ordinance. He noted, however,
that pedestrian safety has been
a long-standing problem. He
referred to an accident in 2003 in
which two University students
were killed when they were hit
by a pickup truck while attempt-
ing to cross the five-lane thor-
oughfare.
Batterman said while he
believes the ordinance will pro-
tect pedestrians' rights, driv-
ers will need to embrace the
changes for the ordinance to be
effective.
"What's been needed on
Plymouth for years is greater
awareness and better facilities,"
Batterman said. "Not backped-
aling on our commitment to
pedestrian safety."'

ARTWORK
From Page 1
gher, director of the Center for
Chinese Studies, papercuts are a
traditional type of Chinese folk
art that consists of images made
from thin red paper that is cut
into various designs. This par-
ticular set of papercuts tells the
story of China's Cultural Revo-
lution and features key images
and people who defined the time
period.
Gallagher said while the
papercuts are not rare artifacts
themselves, it was special to find
a complete set. She added that
it was particularly unusual that
some of the papercuts depicted
Lin Biao, a controversial politi-
cal figure in China who was sup-
posed to succeed Mao Zedong
as emperor before he was killed
in a plane crash in 1971. Biao
gained notoriety when it was
later discovered he was fleeing
China at the time of his death in
an attempt to plot a coup against
Zedong, Gallagher said.
"A lot of papercuts that
were produced in the Cultural
Revolution that showed Lin
Biao would've been destroyed
because his reputation was
destroyed after his death," Gal-
lagher explained. "So it is also
unusual that they had this aspect
too."

Gallagher said the papercuts
were likely originally acquired
by the late Prof. Mike Oksenberg
during his visit to Hong Kong in
the early 1970s. Oksenberg was a
senior staff member in the U.S.
National Security Council from
1977 to 1980 and worked dur-
ing the Carter administration
to improve relations with China
after the Cold War.
While it is not exactly clear
how Oksenberg obtained the
papercuts, Gallagher said the
center's staff believes he either
bought or was given the col-
lection, and then proceeded to
donate the set after he left the
University in 1991.
Wang Zheng, a University
professor of history and women's
studies, was able to contact the
artist of the papercuts, according
to Gallagher. Wang discovered
the papercuts were created in a
small art academy in Guangdong
- a southern Chinese province
near Hong Kong. According to
Gallagher, the artist crafted the
papercuts with knives, rather
than scissors, which made them
easier to replicate.
The center has digitized
images of the papercuts so that
people can view them online.
Currently, the center is trying to
find a way to display the paper-
cuts, but it first plans to frame
them so they are preserved and
protected.

A refuge in Detroit
Wildlife clean-up will have positive impact
t's difficult to envision the transformation of a land plot used for
manufacturing into an environmental protection arena, but it is
happening in Detroit. A 44-acre property on the Detroit River
that was previously used for manufacturing will soon be renovated
and added to the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge - an
initiative to protect and restore the habitats of hundreds of species.
This federally funded project will improve Detroit's natural environ-
ment and potentially produce revenue from tourism. Environmental
projects like the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge will help
rebuild Detroit.


Right now, I'm not the football coach, and that's
something I have to get used to."
- Pennsylvania State University coach Joe Paterno said to students outside his home
about the Board of Trustees' decision to fire him, as reported by the AP on Wednesday.

Don't 'rave' about drugs

The 44-acre property will be the newest
addition to the refuge that is celebrating its
10th anniversary next month. Starting with
only 300 acres, the Detroit Refuge now holds
more than 5,700 acres of protected land. The
territory lies directly in what once was the
industrial core of the Motor City.
The new addition to the refuge will include
a visitor's center along with a dock and fish-
ing pier. The makeover is already underway
and is funded by $1.2 million in federal funds
with another $1.4 million from independent
agencies. The current project is paid for by fed-
eral funds, giving Detroit the benefit of all the
profits. It's good to see the federal government
take an interest in Detroit and support the city
financially.
The property was once a part of the Chrys-
ler Corporation and was utilized by the com-
pany for 44 years. As Michigan moved away
from a manufacturing economy, the site was
abandoned and sat behind barbed wire for 12
years. During its active operation, the site con-
taminated the surrounding area with waste
and industrial byproducts. Today, the Detroit
Refuge is attempting to change an abandoned

wasteland into a source of pride for the city.
The initiative is replanting grasses, restoring
wetlands and capping off contaminated areas.
As Detroit recovers from its economic hard-
ships, becoming more eco-friendly should be at
the top of its priority list.
The waterfront will become safer and
cleaner because the project will help reduce
the contamination. Aside from the site's natu-
ral beauty, the refuge will house endangered
species, like bald eagles, and include attractive
recreational opportunities, like kayaking and
canoeing, that could generate revenue.
Detroit was once an industrial environ-
ment, but rather than mourn the now aban-
doned buildings, city officials are making
positive changes by converting vacant areas
into natural environments. The new addi-
tion to the Detroit River International Wild-
life Refuge will do exactly that. City officials
should seek out similar sites in the Detroit
area and investigate their potential to join the
refuge. Instead of reflecting on the city's eco-
nomic and physical downfall, residents and
officials should focus on developing Detroit's
green future.

The music pul- LEAH
sates, putting POTKIN
listeners in a sed-
ative trance. The
beat grows stronger and faster - rave
culture at its finest.
Until recently, rave culture -
including both the music and the
drugs - was most frequently associ-
ated with past generations. We were
still in diapers during the late '80s
and early'90swhen raves were at the
height of their popularity. However,
the recent reemergence of electronic
music has brought with it a reemer-
gence of notonly raves, butalso drugs
like as ecstasy. Often referred to as
"rave drugs," stimulants like ecstasy
are reportedly taking center stage at
concerts worldwide, and there is no
exception here on campus. Rolling
on ecstasy is becoming increasingly
trendy and, notsurprisingly, the drug
is also becoming increasingly acces-
sible. However, despite the drug's
availability, it is by no means safe and
there are still serious dangers associ-
ated with its use that students should
not disregard.
MDMA, the drug that ecstasy is
primarilymade ofhasbeen shown to

have negative effects on the brain and
body. While the allure of the drug lies
inthe euphoric sensationitproduces,
the sensation does not come without
risk. Not only does long-term use of
MDMA damage the brain, but short-
term, and even single-use, can be
harmful and in some cases deadly.
However, it appears that more and
more often people use popularity as a
way to measure safety and figure that
the more people are doingit,the safer
it must be.
With some of the biggest DJs in
house music - such as Avicii and
Deadmau5 - making appearances
either on or near campus, students
immersed in the electronic music
scene - or possibly eager to experi-
ment - have likely had little trouble
finding excuses to "roll face." How-
ever, it is not only those students
who identify with the house music
scene who pop pills for concerts.
As DJs make sets that cater to their
drugged-out audiences, concertgo-
ers feel it is necessary to take drugs
like ecstasy in order to be on par with
other concertgoers and fully appreci-
ate the music.
Bootstrapping the growing accep-
tance of ecstasy is its sister-drug,
Molly - a drug that boasts deliver-
ance of pure MDMA to its users.
While ecstasy can often be laced
with other drugs unbeknownst to the
user, Molly has a reputation for being
a purer form of the drug that delivers
the same desired effects. Though log-
ical to users, this idea is actually quite
skewed, seeing as it often gives users
a false sense of safety and security -
the I'm "only" doing Molly attitude.

Sure, Molly mightbe the lesser of two
evils, but just because the drug is sup-
posedlypure in form,itstill posesthe
same risks associated with MDMA.
It's all 'rolls'
and games until
somone gets hurt.
While it is easy to ignore the risks
of "rave drugs" when many of your
peers are taking them, students must
remember that it is all fun (or rather,
rolls) and games until someone gets
hurt. To counter the potential dan-
gers related to the resurgence of this
rave culture, it is vital that students
stay educated about drug use and
effects beyond the confines of what
they learn from their friends' experi-
ences with drugs.
Students should also familiarize
themselves with the many resources
available on campus, such as the Uni-
versity Alcohol and Other Drug Pre-
vention Program and others listed on
the University Health Services web-
site, which aim to help educate stu-
dents about drug use and help users
in need. As DJs and house music con-
tinue to grow in popularity, students
must take caution and learn the facts
about drugs before glibly assuming
they are safe merely because "every-
body is doing them."

Bins should better reflect
single-stream recycling
TO THE DAILY:
When I moved into Bursley Residence Hall
my freshman year, I distinctly remember
reading a sign in the trash room at the end of
my hall stating, "Here in University Hous-
ing, we recycle!" Sure, there were separate
bins marked for paper, cardboard, plastic and
waste,but didthis implythat the recyclingsys-
tem set in place was efficient? All the bins in
the trash room were tan and indistinguishable
until I looked closely to determine what mate-
rial belonged in each bin. Although I made a
conscious effort to sort mytrash, I often found
trash inthe recycling bins and vice versa.
Luckily, the University has since made the
switch to single-stream recycling, so the days
of sorting waste into different recycling bins
are history. However, the recycling bins on
campus have not been updated to reflect this
switch. From the Modern Language Building
to Angell Hall, I still see the visually displeas-
ing tan bins indicating paper, plastic or waste.
A lack of uniformly labeled recycling bins has
led to general confusion in the student body.
Although some of the bins have lids that help
New fund gives students the
chance to boost sustainability

students better understand what waste goes
where, this form of identification needs to be
updated.
For example, some of the recycling bins
in the UGLi have rectangular lids, implying
that paper can be placed in the bin. This con-
flicts with the idea of single-stream recycling
because it sends a message to students that
trash must still be sorted. The beauty of sin-
gle-stream recycling is its simplicity, so there
should be a University-wide effort to make
recycling bins more distinguishable from
trashcans.
I am not suggesting that the University
needs to replace the current recycling con-
tainers. The University could instead update
the existing recycling bins by painting them
blue and attaching clear, single-stream recy-
cling signs. Single-stream recycling has
already become more apparent in the Diag
due to the prominent blue bins with infor-
mative signs indicating what can be placed
in the bins. Updating the bins in University
buildings would help to increase the volume
of materials recycled at the University while
also promoting a general understanding of
recycling.

icy announced by President Barack
Obama is a start towards lessening
this burden, in scope of how big the
student loan bubble is expected to
be, it is necessary to begin consider-
ing whether such a financial burden
- for students and for the economy
- is ultimately worth it.
In an Oct. 22 New York Times
opinion piece, Michael Ellsberg
argues that while higher education
is good at producing professionals,
writers, critics and historians, it isn't
necessarily the best at producing
entrepreneurs. He argues that the
late Apple CEO Steve Jobs dropped
out of college and then went on to
invent the iPod. Bill Gates dropped
out, only to found Microsoft. Mark
Zuckerberg dropped out, and we
got Facebook. The co-founders of
Twitter were also, you guessed cor-
rectly, college dropouts. Now this is
a pretty convincing list. These ideas
have grown into multi-billion dollar
companies and all without a college
degree to inspire them.
Ellsberg argues that a college
degree is overrated. In no way is a
college degree necessary to produce
the job creators of society - suc-
cessful entrepreneurs. According to
the National Bureau of Economic
Research, the number one job cre-
ators in this country are start-ups,
not small businesses, as most politi-
cians and lobbyists proclaim (how-
ever, start-ups tend to be small so
the two are often combined). When

it comes to start-ups or entrepre-
neurship, Ellsberg argues that for-
mal education does little to prepare
people.
And, in a way, he has a point. We
grow up learning how to ace stan-
dardized tests or write a formulaic
five-paragraph essay. We don't learn
how to pitch ideas, set up networks
of people or build up and manage an
organization. And the same contin-
ues throughout college. Unless stu-
dents are specifically in a business
program, they don't get lessons on
how to market products, sell things
or formulate innovative ideas. For-
mal schoolingdoesn't focus on train-
ing students to become innovative
entrepreneurs.
Instead of delving into creative
ideas and projects, students are
bogged down by rigid syllabi and
being tested on constricted, nar-
rowly defined subject material. The
way most academic classes are set up
leaves little room for students' cre-
ativity to flourish. Students fall into
the routine rut of papers, assign-
ments and exams. When entering an
increasingly competitive job market,
communication skills, networking
and originality of ideas are just as,
if not more, important than being
able to answer questions about last
week's reading.
But formal education isn't struc-
tured in a way that supports this -
the most practice students get with
these skills occurs due to what they
do outside the classroom. There is
room for improvement. Curriculums
and objectives need to be re-evalu-
ated. In addition to having students
memorize every carbon molecule
structure or all the events of the
Cold War, universities should also be
teaching them how to communicate
ideas, build relations and manage
people and situations. Instead of just
asking them about how well they
know a subject matter, universities
should be asking them about what
they'd like to create.
While it may be true that colleges
and schools in general should do a

better job of encouraging and allow-
ing room for creativity, it is naivete
to think that a college education
isn't useful. In a Nov. 4 Washington
Post article, David E. Drew, chair
for the School of Education Studies
at the Claremont Graduate Univer-
sity writes in response to Ellsberg's
column that Jobs and Gates are the
exceptions, not the rules. Few peo-
ple make it that big without a solid
educational foundation. Statistics
showing that college graduates con-
sistently earn more than non-col-
lege graduates reaffirms this point.
Moreover, even people like Gates
affirm that education is necessary "
to prepare the American workforce
to be competitive. The truth is not
all of us will be the next Bill Gates
or Steve Jobs. Many of us will be
the workers that the new start-ups
employ. And for those positions, a
college education isn't just desirable, *
but necessary.
Formal education
should encourage
creativity.
More than writing off the value
of a college education as a whole, it
is time to re-evaluate what a college
education should provide - what
you want your education to pro-
vide. A college degree still goes a
long way, but at upwards of $50,000
per year, just getting the degree
isn't enough. It is about making
sure that in addition to the piece
of paper and the knowledge, stu-
dents have learned the creative and
communications skills necessary to
make them successful workers and
entrepreneurs.

Michigan duo goes global

By LUCY PERKINS
DailyArts Writer
Last night at The Ark, the ears
of many Ann Arborites were
graced by soft, twangy folk melo-
dies of Michigan's Seth Bernard
and May Erlewine. The concert
celebrated the Oct. 28 release of
their latest album, New Flower,
born from a recent pilgrimage to
Ethiopia. Their energy was infec-
tious - beneath Bernard's bushy
brown beard he never stopped
smiling - and only grew as Erlew-
ine sang. Despite the wild range

Glee Club.
Under the new Hill Auditorium
directorship of From $5
Eugene Rogers,
we will see not only this famil-
iar energy, but also a new level of
global depth within the repertoire
that advances the lauded tradition
of the Michigan Men's Glee Club.
"(It's) not just singing diverse
types of music, but actually in giv-
ing of ourselves to that repertoire
with a fuller understanding of the
music and its culture and where
it come from, and then to do that
with as much authentically as
possible," Rogers said.

Rogers is associate director
of choirs and assistant professor
of conducting in the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance. He has
taken over the reign of the Michi-
gan Men's Glee Club and will be
debuting four premiere pieces in
his first concertas director tomor-
row in the 152nd Annual Fall Hill
Auditorium Concert.
"We're doing everything
from classical pieces to spiritu-
als, music from Germany, Lat-
via, America - anywhere you
can imagine," said Raul Jimenez,
public relations manager for the
Men's Glee Club and a junior in
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance. "It has been a challenging
transition, but Director Rogers
has brought this twist to every-
thing, which has added so much
to our identity as a group."
Among these new twists is Rog-
ers's "Pan African Medley." This
song combines six African pieces
and its compilation speaks to the
range of stylistic breadth that Rog-
ers has as a composer and director.
"These pieces are not con-
nected as much bytextbut in that
they show you different types of
African expression, which spans
from primal energy to traditional
South African music, from joy-
ful Tanzanian tunes to slow and
intimate moments, before ending
in a triumphant Zulu anthem,"

Rogers said.
The Men's Glee Club will
also perform Dave Matthews's
"Gravedigger" and Timothy
Takach's "Luceat Eis" - which
remembers the death of 9/11 vic-
tim Mary-Yolanda Dowling and
reminds us of the value of selfless-
ness during the toth anniversary
of the tragedy.
The show also features a spe-
cial performance by students
from Renaissance High School in
Detroit through the "Brothers In
Song" program, which Jimenez
describes as "a diversity and com-
munity engagement initiative that
provides outreach to underrep-
resented choral programs across
the state."
The "Brothers In Song" pro-
gram has grown large, thanks to
the work of University alumni
and has emerged on other col-
lege campuses. In the concert, the
So young men from Renaissance
High School will both sing their
own material and join in collabo-
ration with the Glee Club.
"But it is not just about sing-
ing," Rogers said. "It is about
engaging them and showing them
our school. It's a tangible way to
connect with others who have
trouble imagining themselves at
this university. That bridge begins
with the Glee Club, and I am very
honored to be a part of that."

"The hotel was on this big lake,

Though each track of New
Flower is tied to the couple's
Ethiopian expedition, some of
the songs, like "When We Run"
and "Talkin Coffee," are more
transparently connected to their
experience.
While some of Seth and May's
songs are performed together,
"Talkin Coffee" features Seth
alone. It focuses on the creation
and importance of fair trade cof-
fee through the musical style of
talking blues, which was made
famous by artists such as Woodie
Guthrie and Bob Dylan.
"The talking blues form is dear
to my heart," Bernard said. "The
form is traditionally American,
where you just talk about the
news of the day, whether it's the
word on the street or an opinion.
I talked about coffee because it's
the third largest traded com-
modity in the world and I wanted
to relate to the coffee regions
throughout the world through
music."
Other songs, like title track
"New Flower," holistically
embody experiences and themes
they found in Ethiopia.
"A lot of our inspiration came
through a lot less educationally
and more inspirationally," Ber-
nard said. "It's about hope strug-
gling and surviving. We were
trying to take what we learned
and experienced from the Ethio-
pian people and put it out there
with all of our heart."

A gross 'Allen Gregory'

Right off the bat, he's estab-

crybaby. From his overtly osten-

just plain awful. In said balcony
scene, Allen Gregory's father,
Richard (French Stewart, "3rd

"Jeremy has AIDS? Full-blown-

writers - if you're going to tell
an AIDS joke, it better be gut-

In fact, Jeremy doesn't have
AIDS, but he does have to get
a job. Meaning Allen Gregory
is stuck going to public school

A month ago, the Miami (Ohio)
hockey team looked like it was
running on all cylinders.
The RedHawks had won the
CCHA Tournament last season
and was fresh off an NCAA Tour-
nament berth. Though they lost
Hobey Baker award winner Andy
Miele, they filled the void with
prized freshman forward Tyler
Biggs. But things have changed
since spring, and now Miami (2-4-
0 CCHA, 4-6-0 overall) is slug-
ging through a mediocre season.
Its forward corps ishavingtrouble
converting its shots into goals,
and even though it has two senior
goalkeepers, its save percentage
has declined.
No. 4 Michigan (3-2-1, 7-2-1)
has dropped seven of its last 10
games against the RedHawks, and
though the Miami team it will face
this weekend is not playing at the
expected level, Michigan coach
Red Berenson does not anticipate
walking away with two easy wins.
"I don't think (the matchup) has
lost any luster for us," Berenson
said. "They've got a good team,
I know they're better than their
record."
But even with a less-than-
stellar start to their season, the
RedHawks are leading Michigan
in one category: time spent in the
penalty box. If Berenson has been
unimpressed with the amount of
penalties the Wolverines have
been taking, it's nothing com-
pared to Miami. The RedHawks
have spent a third of their season
playing a man down, and almost
half of their opponent's goals
have come from power plays.
As a result, the Wolverines
know how critical their special
teams will be during this series.
Michigan's power play unit

end after staying relatively quiet
for most of the season. Last week
proved the unit can score - it did
twice. Now Berenson wants it to
convert more frequently.
"(The power play) has to (play
well)," Berenson said. "We're not
going down there to play ina pen-
alty-filled game, but I know how
they play. If they're playing on
the edge, you've got to be ready to
win with a special teams game if
it comes down to that."
Playing a man up will provide
Michigan with much needed
opportunities to get ahead, but
how it plays shorthanded will be
just as important. According to
Berenson, the power play on last
year's RedHawks squad could
"take you out of a game," and they
did - Miami scored three power
play goals over the course of two
games against Michigan last sea-
son. This year, the RedHawk unit
hasn't been as forceful, but Beren-
son still has important advice for
his team: stay out of the box.
Berenson and the players know
that's easier said than done. The
immensely physical nature of
hockey means that penalties are
inevitable. But though Michigan
can't limit its number of penal-
ties, it can control what kind of
penalties it takes.
"You don't go into a game
thinking 'We can only take four
penalties,' " said junior forward
Lindsay Sparks. "We say we don't
want to take any bad penalties,
we want to take hard working
penalties."
The RedHawks might be the
statistical underdogs in this
weekend's series, but the Wolver-
ines prefer to take that title upon
themselves.
With a 1-1 record on the road,
Michigan hopes to prove that it
can win important games with-
out the comforting confines of

Redshirt sophomore kicker Brendan Gibbons has newfound confidence as Michigan's starting kicker this season, hitting seven of his nine field-goal attempts.

Second-year kicker

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
Redshirt sophomore kicker
Brendan Gibbons grew accus-
tomed to the criticism. He had
to, eventually.
After two games as Michi-
gan's starting kicker last season,
Gibbons was 1-for-4 on field-
goal attempts, missing from 39,
40 and 43 yards.
On a trip to Olive Garden last
season, Gibbons and his room-
mate, redshirt sophomore offen-
sive lineman Taylor Lewan,
decided to test their server's
facial recognition of a few Mich-
igan football players.
"So what do you think of the
kicker this year?" they asked
her.
Without helmets and num-
bers, she had no chance on this
one.
She didn't recognize Lewan,
and Gibbons doesn't look much
different than many other col-
lege students.
"I mean, just make a kick,"
the server said. "What're you
doing?"
"This is (No.) 34, our kicker,"
Lewan said with a grin.
Uh-oh. The embarrassed
employee tried to make amends,

h looks different, but With the unit at 4-for-15,
s taking the field is no then-Michigan coach Rich

Rodriguez exhausted his
options. He resorted to sending
the offense back onto the field
on typical kicking downs.
Gibbons didn't blame him.
"It's pretty hard to go out
there and kick when you're not
doing so well - when it's not
money." Gibbons said.
This season, it's been money
for Gibbons. This time, he even
has the offense behind him.
"He's more confident this
year than he's been in the past -
that's a big thing," said redshirt
senior wide receiver Junior
Hemingway. "And we've got his
back 100 percent, so if he does
miss a field goal, pat him on the
butt and tell him you've got his
back."
When Hoke gave Gibbons
the starting nod in 2011, he did
so on one condition: field-goal
attempts from over 42 yards
would likely be placed on the
booming leg of freshman kicker
Matt Wile.
But the only 40-plus-yard try
went to Gibbons against North-
western. It looks like Wile's
going to have to wait his turn.
"I think I'll kick the rest, but
that's up to him, it's coach's deci-
sion," Gibbons said. "He knows
Matt has a strongleg, but I think
I've proven that I can kick the
long field goal, too."
As Michigan hits the final
stretch of November, the kick-
ing game is increasingly impor-
tant. Finally, the Wolverines
have a headliner.
His face might not be famil-

Opposing defensive
lineman leads the
nation with 11.5
quarterback sacks
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Illinois defensive lineman
Whitney Mercilus is many dif-
ferent things to the Michigan
football team.
To redshirt sophomore offen-
sive tackle Taylor Lewan, and
probably most of his teammates,
he's "85." To Michigan coach
Brady Hoke he's "Marcellus
Wiley, err, Whitney." To redshirt
junior offensive lineman Patrick
Omameh he's Whitney Mercilus,
"the leadingsack producer in the
country."
Mercilus's 11.5 sacks do in fact
lead the country.
A year after Michigan and
Illinois combined for a basket-
ball-like 67-65 score in triple
overtime,hdefense highlights
the matchup this Saturday as
both teams have defensive units
ranked in the top 25 nationally.
And to borrow a basketball term,
Mercilus is the best PTPer (read:
Prime Time Player) on the field.
"He's got great body control,"
Lewan said. "That's something
you don't usually see out of
everybody. Some of the play-
ers you go against are power
guys but they can't really speed
rush off the edge. He's doing a
great job of coming off the edge,
also using the power using his
strength all the time."
So No. 24 Michigan has to
double team Mercilus the whole
game, right?
"I never would want to say
that," Lewan said. "I feel like
if you're going to play football,
especially in this league at this
school, when you get on the field
you have to be the most confident
person on the field and believe
that everything you do is going
to be better than the person in
front of you."
A lot of Michigan's offensive
success will rely on Lewan and
the offensive line's matchup
with Illinois' defensive front.
The Wolverines' 15th-ranked
rush offense averages 232 yards
a game. And with the emergence
of redshirt sophomore Fitzgerald
Toussaint as the lead running
back, Michigan's rushing attack

has found some more stability in
recent weeks.
Toussaint, though, will be
running right into the Fighting
Illini's strength. Mercilus has
combined with fellow defen-
sive end Michael Buchanan - a
player Lewan said didn't get
enough credit because he was
behind Mercilus - to help the
Illinois (2-3 Big Ten, 6-3 overall)
become the best rushing defense
in the Big Ten, allowing just 103
yards a game. The two defensive
ends have done most of the dam-
age, combining for 27 tackles for
a loss. No Michigan player has
more than eight tackles for loss
this season.
If the Wolverines (3-2, 7-2) can
get by the line, it only means run-
ning into the speedy Illinois line-
backers. Hoke said the biggest
thing about the Fighting Illini
defense was their athleticism,
making it tough to counter their
scheme.
"You've got to play (with)
great fundamentals," Hoke said.
"You can't chase ghosts."
Michigan's defense faces the
same problem as its offense:
countering athleticism. Illini
dual-threat quarterback Nathan
Scheelhaase torched the Wol-
verines for four total touchdown
passes and over 300 total yards a
year ago.
Wide receiver A.J. Jenkins
was named to the Biletnikoff
Award preseason watch list.
With Jenkins standing at 6-feet
and 190 pounds, he poses simi-
lar problems as Iowa's Marvin
McNutt, who had 101 receiving
yards a week ago against the
Wolverines.
"We could double him and then
you're going to put single (cov-
erage) on two other guys," said
defensive coordinator Greg Mat-
tison. "When teams do that and
havae ability todothatusually
you have a lot of other guys that
can do it. I don't know that we're
ready to do that right now."
It seems an imperfect fit for
the improved Michigan defense.
Though the unit doesn't have its
own Mercilus, the two counter-
parts have similar elements: a
strong defensive line and a lot of
movement.
Adding in the mobile quarter-
backs, similar to last year, the
two teams appear to be mirror
images of each other, even if it is
one of the funhouse ones. Except
this time, it likely won't be first
to 67.
