Members of the Climate Action 
Movement and the One University 
Campaign 
released 
a 
joint 
statement Friday after staging a 
series of protests and blockading 
the 
exits 
of 
the 
University 
of Michigan Golf Course at 
Thursday’s Board of Regents 
Meeting. The statement reflects 
upon the decisions made at the 
meeting and condemns what 1U 
and CAM claim is inaction on the 
part of the University to divest 
from fossil fuels and equally 
distribute resources across the 
three campuses. 
Some of the two organizations’ 
principal 
demands 
to 
the 
University 
include 
extending 
the Go Blue Guarantee to the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses, 
committing to carbon neutrality 
by 2030 and freezing further 
fossil fuel investments. All of 
these demands were mentioned in 
the joint statement to the Board of 

Regents. 
“The 
shameful 
response 
from 
the 
Administration 
is 
symptomatic of a consistent lack 
of funding transparency, moral 
accountability, and commitment 
to productive dialogue with the 
student body,” the statement 
reads. “Members of the One 
University Campaign and the 
Climate 
Action 
Movement 
understand our demands require 
the Administration to undergo a 
deep examination of its priorities, 
and this process is not simple.”
On Nov. 25, CAM and 1U 
released their first joint statement 
announcing their list of demands 
and establishing a connection 
between the two organizations. 
The first statement also called 
on the University community to 
join 1U and CAM at the protests 
before, during and after the Dec. 
5, regents meeting. No students 
were arrested during any of 
Thursday’s protests.

The University of Michigan 
Medical 
Center 
hosted 
a 
lecture this past Friday on the 
history of its development. The 
lecture was given by Professor 
of Medical History Joel Howell. 
About 120 people attended 
the event, including doctors 
from the medical center and 
applicants for the hospital’s 
intern program. 

Howell said the University 
Hospital was the first hospital 
in the U.S. to be owned and 
operated 
by 
a 
university 
when it was built in 1817. He 
emphasized the fact that the 
introduction of the University 
Medical School in 1850, was 
a key player in the hospital’s 
existence. At the time, it was 
not common for medical schools 
to teach in an application 
structured 
curriculum, 
let 
alone exist as a college. Due 

to the absence of any licensing 
laws on medical practitioners, 
most 
people 
aiming 
for 
a 
medical career would simply 
hold an apprenticeship for two 
years and could open their own 
practice afterward. 
“First of all, there were 
no license-laws. This meant 
that anyone could go out and 
hang up a shingle and start to 
practice 
medicine,” 
Howell 
said. “If you were good, people 
would come to you, and if you 

weren’t so good, people would 
stop seeing you.”
Howell 
said 
the 
school 
ran a two-year program in 
which students would attend 
a specific series of lectures 
the first year, and then take 
the same exact lectures their 
second year. Howell explained 
the hospital did this in the 
hopes students would absorb 
more information.

Analyst examines impact of energy 
needs on nuclear nonproliferation
Expert highlights connection between domestic fuel industry, policy

SOPHIA AFENDOULIS/Daily
Ty Otto, analyst for the Pacific Northwest Laboratory, discusses nonproliferation policy and the U.S. Fuel Cycle at White Auditorium on Friday. 

Friday afternoon, about 50 of 
University of Michigan students, 
professors 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 
community members gathered to 
hear Ty Otto, an analyst at Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory, 
speak 
about 
nonproliferation 
policy and how it relates to and 
affects the nuclear industry at 
the Nuclear Engineering and 
Radioactive Sciences colloquium.
Otto began by explaining 
nonproliferation in the nuclear 
space.
“The 
nonproliferation 
regime … is an overlapping set 
of institutions, laws, treaties, 
informal 
treaties 
between 

governments … that are all 
working to prevent the spread of 
nuclear weapons and to help roll 
back nuclear arsenals where they 
might currently exist,” Otto said.
He 
then 
illustrated 
the 
difficulty 
of 
nonproliferation 
from a policy perspective and 
the many intricacies involved in 
nonproliferation.
“The nuclear nonproliferation 
regime has emerged as the art 
of the possible and every one 
of these agreements requires 
a serendipitous alignment of 
political will and interest coming 
together,” Otto said. “The non-
proliferation 
regime 
is 
not 
perfect … but when you have 
195 countries in the world and 
you want them to all … commit 
to giving up their freedoms and 

rights in order to take part in 
these, sometimes you have to 
take what you can get.”
Otto continued his talk by 
discussing the Atomic Nuclear 
Energy Act of 1954, specifically 
Section 123 of the act, which 
lays out the requirements for 
cooperation between nations.
“The Atomic Energy Act of 
1954 … set out a guideline in 
Section 123 for the requirements 
for peaceful nuclear cooperation 
with other countries,” Otto said. 
“And prior to that time, it was not 
really something that the United 
States had meaningfully engaged 
in.”
He also described the issues 
facing the U.S. today in an 
increasingly competitive nuclear 
industry.

“Back in the day, the United 
States was basically the sole 
provider to most of the Western 
world of enrichment services,” 
Otto explained. “But now China, 
South Korea, Russia, France, 
there is a whole host of different 
countries that we are competing 
against the nuclear marketplace, 
and some of them have different 
perspectives on nonproliferation 
than we do.”
In an interview with The 
Michigan Daily, Todd Allen, 
chair of nuclear engineering 
and 
radiological 
sciences 
at 
U-M, explained why Otto had 
been invited and the NERS 
colloquium.

Smoothie 
King 
held 
its 
grand opening of its Ann Arbor 
location this past Saturday. 
The new store is located in the 
Westgate Shopping Center at 
the intersection of Jackson 
Road and I-94. About 20 people 
attended.
The location held a soft 
opening 
two 
weeks 
ago, 
making it the eighth location in 
Michigan. 
Bob 
Bannatz, 
Smoothie 
King’s district leader for the 
state of Michigan, described the 
reasoning behind the brand’s 
plan to open 50 locations in 
Michigan within the next five 
years. 
“Smoothie King has a big 
footprint 
down 
South, 
and 
because of the cold weather and 
the smoothies and ice, people 
were afraid to move into (the 
north), but we found out that 
it’s a high-quality product,” 
Bannatz said. “People like it, 
and it sells all year round, so we 
came to Michigan.” 
Bannatz said he anticipates a 
mutually beneficial relationship 
with 
the 
students 
at 
the 

University of Michigan. 
“Smoothies are the kind of 
product that fits,” Bannatz said. 
“We have the healthy smoothies, 
we have ones for wellness 
and slim, and then we have a 
dessert blend, so that’s kind of 
our target, what we’re looking 
for. So we hope to grow our 
relationship with the students at 
the University of Michigan.” 
Ann Arbor resident Zhao 
Chen, who currently works for 
Google, was very eager to attend 
the grand opening. 
“I tried it once at the airport. I 
have had the other place before, 
Tropical Smoothie,” Chen said. 
“They’re all right. So, when I 
tried Smoothie King out, it was 
so good. So, when we heard 
there was an opening here, we 
got so excited.”
Other 
locals 
who 
hadn’t 
previously heard about the grand 
opening were also intrigued 
by the event and enthusiasm 
about the opening of a Smoothie 
King in Ann Arbor. Washtenaw 
Community 
College 
student 
Joel Karschbaum learned about 
the event that morning and said 
he was compelled to attend.

“The classes were ungraded, 
and by that I don’t mean A, B, 
C, D, I mean that you heard the 
same lectures, two years in a row,” 
Howell said. “Presumably you 
got more out of it the second time 
around.” 
Howell also said the University 
used to run two separate hospitals: 
one for homeopathic medicine 
and one for allopathic medicine. 
Howell 
explained 
operations 
were performed in the medical 
school amphitheater prior to the 
development of operating rooms.
“The operations were done in 
the medical school amphitheater, 
which was a little bit dicey 
because dissections with cadavers 
were also in the medical school 
amphitheater,” Howell said. “After 
operating on patients, they had to 
be carried across the street and 
across the University to get back 
into the hospital.”

In 1881, the medical school 
became the first to admit women. 
People of color were also admitted 
around the same time, according to 
Howell. Howell shared a photo of 
a classroom in which men of color 
are sitting in the back row of the 
class and the women are sitting in 
a sectioned off bench to the side. He 
also shared a note from the Board of 
Regents in 1870 and two responses 
from news sources of the time.
“The 
regents 
resolved 
in 
1870 that ‘the Board of Regents 
recognized the right of every 
resident 
of 
Michigan 
to 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
the 
privileges 
afforded by the University and 
that they will admit anyone with 
the requisite in literary and moral 
qualifications,’” 
Howell 
said. 
“And with that, we became the 
first major medical school in the 
country to admit women, and they 
got national attention.”

Inagape co-founder Patricia Griffin speaks at the Emerging Markets Conference in Ross Tauber Colloquium Friday.

Seminar highlights immigration 
lawyer’s work with government

Monica Dorman discusses career helping families navigate legal system

University of Michigan alum 
Monica L. Dorman spoke to about 
80 economics students in Lorch 
Hall Friday afternoon. Her talk 
was a part of a lecture series for 
the semester designed to help 
students implement the skills 
they learn in the classroom in 
everyday life. 
Dorman is an immigration 
lawyer 
and 
has 
represented 
clients from over 60 countries. 
She began her own law firm in 
2010 after realizing her previous 
work at a different firm was 
not allowing her to grow as an 
individual. 
She explained she begins her 
day by meeting with new clients 
and 
assessing 
their 
current 
immigration status.
“In any given day, I meet about 

four clients,” Dorman said. “At 
least one of those will be a new 
client — someone who’s coming 
into my office who has never 
met me before who’s going to 
be explaining to me what their 
current immigration situation 
is … I’ll sit down with them, look 
over all of their paperwork, and 
we’ll assess both their current 
situation and what their options 
are.”
During 
Dorman’s 
time 
at 
Michigan, 
she 
majored 
in 
economics. 
After 
debating 
whether or not to take the GRE, 
Dorman ended up deciding to 
pursue a career in law. Then, after 
pursuing law school and working 
at various corporations, Dorman 
said she wanted to help more 
people. 
“I realized that there were 
three main components that I was 
looking for in a job that I would 
derive utility from,” Dorman said. 

“One was contact with clients. 
I knew that I wanted to engage 
with my contacts … that I wanted 
some autonomy over my career, 
over my caseload. I wanted to be 
able to make decisions about the 
proper way to handle a case … to 
make decisions about whether 
or not I even felt comfortable 
representing that client at all.” 
Dorman told the economics 
students to only pursue a career 
they feel is rewarding to them. 
“I would encourage you as you 
go through your studies in econ, 
whether or not you’ve decided 
this is truly your academic 
home or not, whether or not you 
buy into the principles behind 
economics, at least utilize them to 
your advantage, so you’re able to 
make those decisions for yourself 
and come to a conclusion or 
come to a career or come to some 
other undertaking that you find 
rewarding,” Dorman said. 

LSA sophomore Ryan Perry 
said he thought Dorman’s words 
were different from what students 
typically hear from other guest 
lecturers. 
“The whole semester has been 
a series of different speakers, so 
this was very interesting, because 
it was something totally different 
from the rest,” Perry said. “The 
other ones were about consulting 
and business, which it great, but 
it was cool to get another, diverse 
view on what you can do with an 
econ major.” 
LSA junior Isabel Chaney said 
she was surprised by the event 
overall. 
“I really liked the diversity 
of 
questions 
that 
students 
had,” Chaney said. They were 
about a mix of her career, the 
immigration process in general, 
and I liked that she was able to 
touch on a lot of different things 
through the talk.”

Monday, December 9, 2019 — 3A

This is now one of the best times 
of the year in my opinion. Even if 
you don’t celebrate a particular 
holiday, it is great to acknowledge 
the power of love, offering and 
being surrounded by others. I 
personally celebrate Thanksgiving 
and Christmas — growing up in 
a Christian family has made this 
time very important to me. When 
I think about the holidays, I realize 
the integrity of culture to the 
traditions of these celebrations. I 
am used to going to church more 
during this season and having 
huge family dinners consisting of 
soul food and card games.
But there is another holiday 
that I realize has ties to my 
heritage that I have yet to formally 
celebrate: Kwanzaa is a week-long 
holiday celebrated from December 

26th to January 1st in and around 
the United States to celebrate and 
honor African heritage in our 
culture. For some reason when I 
was in elementary school learning 
about Kwanzaa, I always thought 
of it as something celebrated by 
people of another culture. I didn’t 
have any friends who celebrated 
it even though the majority of 
my friends were also African-
American, so it never seemed 
strange to me that my family never 
did.
I think the reasoning for this 
is sometimes it is hard for people 
of African descent to think of 
ourselves as African. We are called 
“African-American,” but many of 
us have no idea what country in 
Africa our ancestors came from. 
I guess this brings the question of 
what African heritage means in 
America.
 When I have to check off 

boxes describing myself, I always 
have to check off “Black/African-
American.” I am an American 
citizen, and I know that I have 
African ancestry, but somehow I 
always feel guilty for calling myself 
“African.” This is an issue that 
many people come across because 
we don’t have a straightforward 
answer as to where our ancestors 
came from. Is it okay for us to 
celebrate it even if we don’t feel 
connected to African culture? 
I have to be honest, if someone 
asked me to name one African 
tradition or even something of my 
heritage, I would struggle. This 
is why celebrating a holiday that 
is supposed to be dedicated to my 
“heritage” is difficult. I don’t know 
my heritage or what it means. This 
is something that I will continue to 
think about as I am enjoying the 
holidays this season –– and I might 
even celebrate Kwanzaa, too.

Should I celebrate 
Kwanzaa?

Deceiver

Africa hears my name and calls 
me to herself
She doesn’t know Ayomide 
means Jacob
Or maybe she does and ignores 
this because 
I smell like Sunday afternoons 
filled with Nigerian yams
And fried egg seasoned with 
suya peppeh
Africa knows the difference 
between peppeh and pepper but
Kiana does not
Kiana 
smells 
like 
Sunday 
morning breakfasts filled with 
slow-cooked grits 
And shrimp seasoned with 
cayenne pepper
I see how Africa treats her 
because of this so I am

caught between a rock and a 
hard place
The rock is the dusty, pothole-
ladden “highway” between Lagos 

and Abeokuta
The hard place is the breached 
levees in New Orleans 
And I wait in the middle 
wondering whose frustration I 
should carry
I am wary of the line between 
Africa 
and 
her 
descendants 
because
Africa has been born again
And the diaspora are just 
children of the slave woman
And the diaspora are just 
children of the same woman

Every day,
I find myself caught between a 
rock and a hard place
The rock is green and white and 
corrupt
The hard place is red and green 
and black and 
I wait in the middle wondering 
whose anger I should carry
I am wary of the line between 
African-American
But I don’t know if it is for 
connection or separation

Africa 
has 
been 
writhing 
with the pains of labor since her 
conception
And her first born have long 
been forgotten

And their language has long 
been forgotten

The pressure increases as I find 
myself caught between a rock and 
a hard place
The rock is my identity
Or the one I grew up with
The hard place is my destiny
Where I’ve been given a chance 
to grow
I don’t know whose purpose I 
should carry
I am wary of the line between 
Nigerian and Black
And I don’t know if I can keep 
double dutching much longer
Africa sees my name and calls 
me to herself
And knows I’m not her firstborn 
when she smells my clothes
But she blesses me anyway

October, 
November 
and 
December are some of my 
favorite months of the year. 
There are holidays such as 
Halloween and Thanksgiving, 
followed by one of my favorite, 
Christmas. Being Muslim, I 
always get weird looks from 
people when I tell them that 
Christmas is one of my favorite 
times of the year. It’s true, I am 
Muslim and I love Christmas 
time. To specify, I love the 
atmosphere that comes with 
Americanized Christmas. 
I don’t love the consumerism 
that comes with Christmas. I 
don’t love the idea of minimum-
wage 
workers 
working 
overtime 
instead 
of 
being 
with their families. I don’t 
love how commercialized a 
religious holiday has become. I 
understand that Christmas was 
originally a holiday to celebrate 
the birth of Jesus. There are 
several Christian traditions that 
come with traditional Christmas 
such as going to mass, having a 
tree that represents Jesus and 
singing Christmas songs to talk 
about the birth of Jesus. Parts 
of traditional Christmas still 

do exist today but Christmas in 
America has definitely evolved 
from these traditional ideas.
What 
I 
actually 
love 
about Christmas time is the 
community, 
culture 
and 
happiness that seems to come 
with it. There are very few days 
in the year where the entirety of 
the U.S. seems to comes together 
to celebrate one thing happily. 
Though not everyone in the U.S. 
today 
celebrates 
Christmas, 
including my family, everyone 
has some sort of sense that it 
is Christmas time and that it is 
a time of coming together with 
the ones you love. 
With that being said, I do 
understand that Christmas is 
not always a happy time for 
everyone. 
People 
have 
bad 
memories 
associated 
with 
Christmas and not everyone has 
a family or someone to celebrate 
Christmas 
with. 
Christmas 
can be a hard time for many, a 
time of mourning, sadness and 
nostalgia. 
In my experience, Christmas 
has always been a time where 
I can watch Christmas movies, 
listen to Christmas music, walk 
down any sort of downtown 
and look at Christmas lights, 
etc. Even though my family 
does not celebrate Christmas 

whatsoever, I have different 
traditions that are my own that 
happen during Christmas time. 
My friends and I play Secret 
Santa or White Elephant, we 
drive around to see Christmas 
lights, 
we 
bake 
Christmas 
cookies with siblings, and for 
an instant, we forget everything 
else bad going on in the world. 
For some, Christmas is like 
an escape from reality for a 
quick second. It is a time where 
you can be with the people you 
love and do what you enjoy. 
Celebrating the small things 
in life such as putting up lights 
with grandparents or decorating 
cookies with a sibling. 
So yes, I am a Muslim who 
loves 
Christmas 
time 
and 
most aspects of it. I come 
from a family that has never 
celebrated Christmas yet I am 
that person that starts listening 
to Christmas music right after 
Halloween 
and 
sometimes 
even before. I have 12 Days of 
Christmas socks and a small 
Christmas tree in my room. I 
love Christmas time because 
it is one of the only times of 
the year where people come 
together with their families 
and communities, are happy 
and kind to others, and there is 
goodwill in the air.

With the closing of A/PIA 
Immigration Awareness Week, we 
present this year’s UAAO Execu-
tive Board annual board photo-
shoot as an opportunity to raise 
awareness 
regarding 
former 
University of Michigan presi-
dent James B. Angell’s role in the 
creation of the Chinese Exclu-
sion Act, how this established 
precedence 
for 
longstanding 
anti-Asian rhetoric in the United 
States, and UAAO’s stance as an 
Asian American advocacy group 
on campus.
We 
present 
this 
year’s UAAO photoshoot: “Can 
you recognize Angell with all of 

our Colors?”
The U.S. legislation created 
by James B. Angell, the former 
University of Michigan president 
that we commemorate when we 
participate in any institutional 
entity named after him, such as 
simply walking through Angell 
Hall, played a foundational role in 
U.S. exclusion of Chinese immi-
grant populations. This period of 
Chinese exclusion paved the way 
for the xenophobic propaganda 
that has pervaded many facets of 
Asian American discourse.
The Angell Treaty, drafted by 
James B. Angell and signed by 
U.S. Senate on November 17th, 
1880, paved the way for the Chi-
nese Exclusion Act. In this treaty, 
Angell advocated to severely limit 
Chinese immigration to the Unit-

ed States, with justification that 
Chinese immigrants were unas-
similable and threats to white 
racial purity. The Angell Treaty 
amended the Burlingame-Seward 
Treaty of 1868, which had sought 
to expand the right to free immi-
gration and held provisions for 
Chinese citizens. Instead of sup-
porting the pre-existing effort to 
expand the rights of the Chinese 
immigrant communities working 
on the transcontinental railroad, 
the Angell Treaty was signed as 
U.S. law in 1881, ending free Chi-
nese immigration into the United 
States. The success of the Angell 
Treaty became an outlet for the 
agendas of anti-Chinese lobby-
ists, culminating into the Chinese 
Exclusion Act of 1882 that barred 
the 
immigration 
of 
Chinese 

laborers. The Chinese Exclusion 
Act was the first U.S. immigration 
law to ban an entire ethnic group. 
The Chinese Exclusion Act 
separated marriages, prevented 
the formation of families, and 
trapped Chinese laborers who 
intended to return to their homes 
in China. In this time, Asian 
populations had never asked to 
be American. The Angell Treaty 
of 1880 not only set precedence 
for Chinese American exclu-
sion following 1882 through the 
demonization of this immigrant 
population, but also an era of pan 
Asian American exclusionary leg-
islation.The Chinese Exclusion 
Act was later expanded into the 
Immigration Restriction Act of 
1924 that barred all Asian immi-
gration, except for migrant labor 

from the Philippines, a U.S. colo-
ny at the time. The Immigration 
Restriction Act was not amend-
ed until 1965. Angell’s abuse of 
power, which furthered a xeno-
phobic and white supremicist 
agenda, produced and perpetu-
ated several harmful perceptions 
that affect our Asian American 
identity, from perpetual for-
eignness to the model minority 
myth, which our community is 
still left to navigate. The era of 
Asian American exclusion can be 
understood as a catalyst for Asian 
and American to be put together 
as a political identity. We reclaim 
political exclusion when we say 
Asian/ American, Asian-Ameri-
can, and Asian American.
To Stand in Angell is to Stand 
in Resistance.

UAAO looks onto the Univer-
sity’s historical involvement in 
Asian American exclusion with 
only revulsion. While our his-
tory 
books 
have 
propagated 
these exclusionary practices to 
have been acceptable in the time 
period, we reject such claims 
in consideration of the Chinese 
immigrant populations whose 
detestments to exclusion were 
never considered in the White 
centric history that we remem-
ber the Chinese Exclusion Act by. 
President Angell’s actions only 
become admissible by accepting a 
history of silencing Asian Ameri-
cans through exclusion of our 
populations.

The juvenile justice system needs reform

Ask first, post later

I

n October, Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer 
signed 
into 
law a bill decreeing that 
Michigan’s 
court 
system 
will no longer automatically 
treat 17-year-old offenders 
as adults. Unless the district 
attorney wants to try the 
defendant as an adult, which 
it reserves the right to do, 
juvenile courts will handle 
the cases. This is a victory 
for proponents of criminal 
justice reform, and it is not 
the only way in which the 
juvenile system has improved.
In the past 20 years, the 
population 
of 
incarcerated 
juveniles has been at its 
highest, reaching a peak in 
2000, after a long spate of 
heightened crime in the 1990s. 
However, between 2001 and 
2013, the number fell more 
than 53 percent, from 76,000 
to 35,000. In addition, 23 
states and Washington D.C. 
have banned life sentences 
without parole for juvenile 
offenders. In the 2012 case 
Miller v. Alabama, the U.S. 
Supreme Court banned the 
practice 
of 
automatically 
giving 
juvenile 
offenders 
life in prison without the 
possibility 
of 
parole. 
The 
court 
then 
applied 
that 
standard retroactively with 
the 2016 case of Montgomery 
v. Louisiana, which forced 
states to reconsider the life 
sentences 
of 
people 
who 
committed 
crimes 
when 
they were juveniles. Because 
of this crackdown on the 
practice, just three states 
account for two-thirds of 
all juvenile life sentences: 
Michigan, Pennsylvania and 
Louisiana. As of this August, 
55 percent of those Michigan 
prisoners — almost 200 people 
— are still waiting for their 
sentences to be reviewed in 
accordance with Montgomery 
v. Louisiana.
These sentencing numbers 
are different from state to 
state 
because 
each 
state 
conducts juvenile proceeding 
in different ways. Some states 
charge people as young as 
16 years old as adults, while 
others, like Vermont, will let 
non-violent offenders as old 
as 21 be tried as juveniles. 

States distinguish between 
juveniles and adults during 
criminal proceedings because 
young minds are different 
than older ones. Teenager’s 
brains are still developing, 
so 
their 
mental 
analysis 
of risk and reward is less 
sophisticated than an adult’s. 
Because young people have 
less mental capacity to make 
calculated 
decisions, 
their 
actions are not to be held to 
the same standard as adults.

Additionally, kids are more 
likely to conform to their 
surroundings than adults are, 
and prison can therefore shape 
their worldview and behavior 
much more extensively than 
it would an adult’s. This was 
recognized in 1889, when 
Chicago established the first 
separate detention system for 
youth. When young people are 
detained with adult offenders, 
they 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
reoffend upon release. 
Rehabilitation, 
the 
idea 
that the state should help 
criminals back into society 
and prepare them for their 
release, is one of the main 
theories 
of 
punishment. 
Treating juveniles as adults 
is not just ineffective, it is 
counterproductive to the goal 
of criminal justice. One way 
juvenile justice has changed 
to better accommodate this 
goal is through disciplinary 
measures that do not involve 
incarceration. They offer help 
like guidance counselors that 
are meant more to support 
the offenders than punish 
them. These are critical to 
the success of the system 
because they are effective in 
preventing young offenders 
from committing crimes as 
adults. 

Despite 
that 
effort, 
the 
system still falls short all 
too often. More than 4,000 
juveniles are locked in adult 
jails 
and 
prisons, 
which 
severely 
endangers 
them: 
a young person goes into 
prison, they often become 
victims of heinous crimes. 
A 
juvenile 
incarcerated 
in an adult prison is five 
times more likely than an 
adult 
imprisoned 
in 
the 
same facility to be sexually 
assaulted in prison, as noted 
by Congress in 2003.
Racial 
disparities 
have 
also gotten worse in the 
juvenile 
justice 
system. 
Young 
African-Americans 
were detained, on average, at 
four times the rate of of their 
white counterparts in 2001. 
That 
difference 
increased 
fivefold in 2017. In Wisconsin, 
New 
Jersey, 
Montana, 
Delaware, Connecticut and 
Massachusetts, 
African-
American 
minors 
are 
10 
times 
more 
likely 
than 
white minors to be detained. 
Furthermore, 
while 
the 
population of incarcerated 
juvenile offenders sharply 
declined during the early 
2000s, 
it 
dropped 
much 
faster for white youth than 
it did for Black youth, which 
worsened 
the 
existing 
racial divide. This disparity 
reflects a structural bias 
within the juvenile justice 
system that extends to the 
criminal justice system at 
large. 
The juvenile justice system 
has succeeded in addressing 
a variety of problems that 
the overall criminal justice 
system often struggles with. 
It 
has 
seriously 
brought 
down 
its 
incarcerated 
population, and states have 
been 
passing 
more 
laws 
protecting 
the 
rights 
of 
minors during sentencing. 
That 
said, 
the 
atrocious 
racial disparity and high rate 
of sexual assault, especially 
among juveniles locked up 
with 
adults, 
demonstrates 
that the system still has large 
strides to make.

O

n a recent weekend 
night, a friend of mine 
had too much to drink, 
leading to some embarrassing 
but funny moments. These 
moments 
were 
inevitably 
captured 
and 
uploaded 
to 
social media as part of the fun. 
At the time it seemed natural. 
But thinking about it later, 
I wondered: Was it wrong 
to have shared the video 
without our friend’s consent? 
Were we unnecessarily using 
them for our own benefit? 
Sharing pictures and videos 
of our friends and family has 
become automatic in a lot 
of contexts. Parties, game 
nights, random embarrassing 
or funny moments — time 
spent with those closest to 
us is a consistent source of 
content for our social media. 
But should it be?
Not without their consent.
When thinking about this, 
I found a thought experiment 
helpful: Would you be willing 
to show the picture or video in 
question as part of a slideshow 
to a room of your followers? 
If 
not, 
maybe 
posting 
it 
deserves a second thought. 
We’ve 
been 
conditioned 
to 
assume 
anything 
and 
everything belongs online as 
part of our perpetual digital 
performance. See something, 
post 
something. 
This 
mentality makes everything, 
including the people closest to 
us, a means to an end — the end 
being a post that entertains or 
fulfills our particular social 
media goals.
There 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
capturing 
moments and taking scripted 
snapshots. 
Capturing 
a 
moment involves recording 
something that is happening, 
usually spontaneously (think 
a picture you take of a friend 
doing something at a party). 
A scripted snapshot is where 
everyone involved decides to 

come together to take a picture 
or video (think the picture 
you take after a family event). 
I’m writing about capturing 
moments and posting them. 
Scripted snapshots involve a 
level of consent that makes 
posting 
them 
unsurprising. 
Capturing moments, however, 
usually involves a level of 
intimacy that makes posting 
them 
more 
invasive 
and 
problematic. We do things 
with our close friends and 
family 
that 
we 
don’t 
do 
with anyone else because of 
the 
trust, 
acceptance 
and 
bonds that come with those 
relationships.
The 
funny 
thing 
about 
the real world is that we 
are invisible to most people 
outside of our inner circle. 
But when we are recorded and 
put online, we are suddenly 
visible. People who would 
otherwise have no interest in 
what you’re doing are suddenly 
captivated by the face staring 
back at them. They have a 
whole digital profile (name, 
Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, 
Instagram, 
etc.) 
to 
attach 
to the content that they’re 
seeing, making the irrelevant 
and meaningless relevant and 
meaningful. Our close friends 
and family are the only people 
who can break through this 
wall. They are the only ones 
who care enough to record 
our everyday moments, and 
therefore they are the only 
ones with the power to make 
the 
quotidian 
permanent, 
searchable 
and 
visible 
to 
everyone else.
Asking for consent when 
sharing 
moments 
would 
respect those closest to us and 
encourage critical thinking 
about 
privacy. 
Asking 
permission 
acknowledges 
people’s 
autonomy 
and 
personal 
preferences. 
It 
treats them with respect and 
avoids making them simple 

fuel for social media. Asking 
permission also forces the 
poster and the subject to 
consider the costs, benefits 
and motivations of a post 
instead of participating in 
the automatic sharing process 
common 
today. 
It 
would 
resist the commoditization 
of our lives and encourage 
conversations 
about 
social 
media use and privacy that 
rarely 
occur. 
Do 
parents’ 
embarrassing moments need 
to be online? Should their 
kids’ be? Should your friends’ 
weird 
habits 
or 
drunken 
revelry be posted? Maybe. 
Maybe not. But the question 
should be asked.
As more and more people 
feel 
like 
they 
have 
lost 
control 
of 
their 
privacy 
online, asking before posting 
moments would be a small 
step toward regaining control. 
Yes, it won’t eliminate the 
constant tracking from tech 
companies, data brokers and 
everyone else with a vested 
interest in the surveillance 
economy. 
But 
it 
would 
encourage 
more 
awareness 
about privacy and the effects 
of technology and potentially 
foster healthier relationships. 
Thinking back to my friend, 
holding off on posting until 
asking 
them 
would 
have 
cost next to nothing (other 
than 
instant 
gratification) 
while 
potentially 
avoiding 
making them an instrument, 
embarrassing them or creating 
anxiety about who saw the 
video. It seems obvious that 
asking for permission before 
posting 
moments 
is 
the 
right thing to do in a close 
relationship. We care for our 
close friends and family in 
many different ways. Why 
should their presence online 
be any different?

Make friends who don’t look like you
I 

never had trouble making 
friends. 
Coming 
into 
college, the least of my 
concerns was being able to 
connect with others and form 
new relationships. However, 
looking 
back 
at 
my 
first 
semester, I realize I neglected 
to 
acknowledge 
a 
certain 
tension I felt while trying to 
socialize with other freshmen. 
Something continuously made 
me 
uncomfortable, 
and 
it 
took me time to realize this 
discomfort signified a problem 
I never experienced before. 
There 
were 
consistent, 
subtle comments of disgust 
from my peers about the types 
of food I liked, such as raw fish 
and soy-sauce based dishes. 
There was also a dislike for the 
way I ate in regard to sounds 
my mouth made. This divide 
in palate and food shouldn’t 
have discouraged me from 
opening up to others — but it 
did. It made me ashamed of my 
eating habits and my cultural 
background 
as 
a 
whole, 
causing me to feel isolated and 
resulted in me shying away 
from communities I bonded 
with at U-M. 
I was a little disheartened 
but 
remained 
determined 
to 
branch 
out 
and 
meet 
more people. A group of my 
friends I just met decided 
to get poke bowls, and I was 
excited to explore the variety 
of restaurants in Ann Arbor. 
But throughout the meal, I 
had 
stereotypical 
questions 
directed toward me regarding 
eastern Asia. A girl asked 
me whether or not Japan 
experienced daylight, because 
all the images she saw of the 
country were at night. Another 
asked if I ate poke often, even 
though I never mentioned 
anything about my heritage.
Refusing to be discouraged, 
I went out on a Friday night 
with a new group of people, 
and at a party one guy asked 
one of the girls I was with to 
dance, and she said no. When I 
later asked her why, she replied 
that “she had already hooked 
up with one Black guy” earlier 
that week. Even though I don’t 
identify as Black, it was clear 
that race was salient to them 
when considering a hook-up, 
which meant they filter people 
by race, including me. 

This disconnect or feeling 
of alienation stemmed from 
the fact that, in all these cases, 
I was the only person in the 
group who identified as a 
person of East Asian descent. 
It 
would 
be 
grossly 
inaccurate to say I haven’t met 
people who are open-minded, 
compassionate 
and 
kind 
people. That being said, what I 
underestimated was the extent 
that microaggressions would 
upset me. This is not because 
of 
prejudice 
or 
ignorance, 
but 
because 
they 
created 
racially-charged barriers that 
prevented me from making 
friends outside my race. 

My 
closest 
friends 
back 
home don’t identify as my race, 
and until now, I surrounded 
myself with people who didn’t 
look like me. I planned to 
create the same communities 
in college. However, the past 
few months have highlighted 
the significance of race at 
U-M. Students recognize each 
other’s race and use it to create 
barriers 
in 
their 
personal 
communities, with or without 
intention. It seems to me that 
friend groups are often created 
along the lines of skin color 
and force people to stay in 
their comfort zones. 
I understand that diverse 
groups exist at the University, 
but 
I 
have 
noticed 
as 
a 
freshman that friend groups 
within 
the 
class 
of 
2023 
are often divided by race. 
And 
this 
isn’t 
uncommon. 
It makes logical sense that 
people 
create 
friendships 
based 
on 
similarities, 
and 
commonalities tend to not cut 
across race.
Given this observation, I 
want to emphasize how crucial 
it is for students — especially 
freshmen 
— 
to 
create 
diverse 
relationships 
and 

how integral and beneficial 
interracial friend groups can 
be to individuals. Researchers 
Thomas Pettigrew and Linda 
Tropp conducted the “Meta-
analytic test of intergroup 
contact theory”, which found 
that 
intergroup 
contact 
typically reduces intergroup 
prejudice. 
These 
prejudices 
and fear of prejudice from 
peers convey that students 
expect interracial encounters 
to go badly, according to 
another 
study 
done 
by 
Elizabeth Page-Gould, Rodolfo 
Mendoza-Denton and Linda 
Tropp at UMass Amherst. The 
study also defines the solution 
to this dilemma as “guided 
relationship-building,” which 
rectifies the anxiety people 
have interacting with groups 
of different races. 
My desire to reach out 
to 
people 
from 
different 
backgrounds, along with the 
prejudice I have encountered, 
could 
both 
be 
virtually 
resolved by students becoming 
mindful 
of 
who 
they 
are 
surrounding themselves with. 
According to Professor Miles 
Hewstone at the University of 
Oxford, behavior sociologists 
warn 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
homophily — the tendency for 
people to create relationships 
with people who are socially 
similar 
to 
themselves 
— 
fortifies 
stereotypes 
about 
both 
ourselves 
and 
other 
groups. This leads us to believe 
our own groups are superior, 
and 
consequently 
portray 
other groups as lesser, which 
can even result in a dislike of 
these “lesser groups.” 
I don’t take the comments 
I mentioned before to heart. 
I realize that, in part, what 
makes 
freshman 
year 
so 
difficult is the fact that we 
are 
encountering 
people 
from a multitude of different 
communities. 
University 
students 
need 
to 
take 
advantage of the sheer number 
of undergraduates in school 
here 
and 
create 
not 
only 
racially diverse communities, 
but 
communities 
with 
variation 
in 
socioeconomic 
background 
and 
cultural 
heritage.

Homophily 
fortifies 
stereotypes about 
both ourselves 
and other groups

Treating juveniles 
as adults is not just 
ineffective, it is 
counterproductive

Monday, December 9, 2019 — 5A

Midway through Paul Yoon’s “Run Me to Earth,” a woman 
quietly mends shirts in her hut in the mountains. Within 
the next few pages, she finds herself tangled in a stand-
off between a hysterical father and the other people in her 
camp, a stand-off that involves weeping, strangulation and a 
stabbing. Extraordinarily, this moment of violence and what 
should be excitement has the same emotional impact as the 
one of neutral stillness just moments before. Though the novel 
promises an intricately woven story about the aftermath and 
effects of war, it somehow manages to paint images of pain and 
graphic suffering with the same brush used to depict tranquil 
scenes observing birds and peaceful landscapes. This strange 
dichotomy is not a singular occurrence; rather, the lack of 
contrast between emotionally charged and depleted scenes 
repeats throughout the novel, rendering the plot flaccid and 
monotonous.
The novel follows the stories of teenage orphans Alizak, 
Prany and Noi as they navigate bomb-ridden Laos to care 
for wounded civilians and obtain supplies on behalf of 
Vang, a doctor who supplies them with food and shelter as 
compensation for their services. It is 1969, and the country 
is being torn apart by a civil war between the United States-
backed Royal Lao Government and Communist opposition. 
The novel is structured as a patchwork of voices of several 
characters, stretching across countries and years; but despite 
its ambitious arch, I was forced to admit that the end of the 
novel had me feeling as indifferent and unfamiliar towards its 
characters as I had when reading the first page. 
While such narrative structure allows for a more multifaceted 
take on traditional linear plot construction, the jarring leaps in 
time and indecisive switches between narrative voices render 
“Run Me to Earth” shallow and groundless. While these kinds 
of novels often have a satisfying effect of bringing the overall 
narrative full circle, it felt as if Yoon was reaching too far to 
find a way that the different voices of each section are related 
to each other. 
This is not to say that the novel is devoid of descriptive words 
and phrases for outward characteristics and scenes. There are 

even a few passages that are unquestionably beautiful:
“He fought back, got cut four times, swallowed his own 
tooth once, and waited a day thinking it would exit out of him 
— that he would get it back — and then wept when he searched 
for it in his own shit, alone, in a field, and it wasn’t there. His 
own tooth had vanished somewhere inside of him. There were 
times this fact bothered him more than his own hunger or the 
sudden volley of gunfire.”
And still, despite the lyricism of these passages, they manage 
to merge in a way that still fails to add color to a drab landscape.
Though the novel is a conglomerate of several different 
characters’ voices, there is an element of detachment that 
not only disconnects them from each other, but also alienates 
the reader. Somehow, even at halfway through the novel, any 
semblance of character development was nonexistent. Even 
the plot progression felt lagging, and it was extremely difficult 
to continue mucking through the plot without attachment to 
any part of the novel. Yoon’s detached and impersonal writing 
style works for other readers, who praise it as “a sparely (sic) 
written gem.” Others claim that the novel “(finds) depth of 
emotion in formal restraint,” but the repressed nature of this 
novel only served in estranging me from its characters. 
Perhaps Yoon intentionally wrote in a restrained manner to 
suggest how normalized the violence and suffering of war has 
become for the Laotian people. Though even if his intention 
is to make such a statement, it fundamentally impairs one’s 
reading experience by failing to create an engaging narrative 
and presenting characters to which readers find it difficult 
to forge connections with. “Run Me to Earth” addresses 
an interesting and important facet of history, but with an 
approach that lacks emotional weight and urgency. While it is 
not an enjoyable read, the novel lacks enough traction to even 
formulate an aggressively negative review.

‘Run Me to Earth’ is oddly alienating

BOOK REVIEW

JO CHANG

My eldest cousin just passed his second level sommelier test. A 
sommelier is a trained wine professional who generally works in a 
fine restaurant with an expertise on food and wine pairing along with 
wine selection. He’s the first of the six cousins to become a sommelier 
— my father and my uncle have both been sommeliers since their mid 
twenties. 
When we turned 15, all five of us — my two brothers, two cousins and 
I — started working in our family’s restaurants. We didn’t have much 
of a choice, I suppose, but we also wanted to be there. Our evenings 
were spent in the crazed push and pull of a smoky, beloved building on 
Riverside Avenue — Basil T’s — a place where, among homemade beer 
and perfectly crispy pizzas, the five of us were raised. Instead of learning 
to ride bikes or fill out multiplication tables, we focused on how to grate 
parmigiano reggiano, how to use a prosciutto cutter properly, how to 
pour the perfect ratio of olive oil to balsamic vinegar. These restaurants 
feel more like home than our parent’s houses. They are the product of 
so much labor and so much love, they rest on my father’s shoulders like 
tangy, sweet tomato sauce on top of ropes of homemade pasta. They are 
physical manifestations of my family bloodline, a consistent reminder 
of my heritage, a sanctuary of Italian wines and Sicilian rice balls, and 
most importantly, a love letter to the place I love most: Italy. 
From hostess to waitress to bartender, I certainly wore as many hats 
possible in the restaurant industry (save line cook or sous chef because 
I’m not a very good cook, embarrassingly), and fell in love with quality 
food and the almost poetic, out of the ordinary experience that is a 
Saturday night in an Italian restaurant in New Jersey. At most jobs, one 
can anticipate how a day will go — but in a restaurant, nothing will ever 
be concrete or known until it occurs. The customers, filling the tables 
I’ve known and adored for my entire 21 years, are the audience.
Eating at a restaurant is an experience from start to finish. In many 
ways, a chef is an artist. A restauranteur is a conductor. From soil to 
plate, ingredients are thought out, carefully placed, creatively paired. 
Long before the forkful of ricotta gnocchi paired with roasted eggplant 
and bufala mozzarella is suspended on a fork, steaming below your nose, 
it’s been methodically thought through.

When you’re in peak adolescence, the world seems like it’s going 
to end at any second. Every test you fail, every sports game you 
lose, every dance you go to without a date — it’s all amplified by the 
thousands until you graduate and realize it meant so little. But while 
you’re there, it’s comforting to know that you’re not the only one that 
sees things through a movie lens, which is why shows like “Pretty 
Little Liars” and “Gossip Girl” have been so successful in their reign 
of television. “Dare Me” merges 
the good and bad of the modern 
teenage drama into a mixture of 
sorts: it’s a blend of high school 
pettiness, 
toxic 
friendships, 
sports 
competitions, 
crime, 
cheating and random dance 
scenes. Based off the book of the 
same name by Megan Abbott, 
the television adaptation centers 
around a group of teenage girls, 
each a mirror image of a type 
of high school girl we’ve seen 
in the past. Seeing as they’re all 
on the cheerleading team, they 

carry a sense of superiority with them as they go throughout high 
school. That is, until a championship-winning new coach takes over, 
and the team struggles with the new structure.
At its best, the show is well-paced and unpredictable. The lighting 
is dim and ominous; it captures the essence 
of the typical teen drama and makes us feel 
like something is always lurking around the 
corner. Its tone makes you feel on edge while 
watching it, and it’s hard to tell what the main 
conflict is going to be. The small, ongoing 
passive-aggressive moments edge toward the 
feeling 
that 
something’s 
going 
to 
implode 
at 
any moment — the main quality of the 
show that keeps viewers locked in. 
It’s evident that the show is primarily 
targeted toward a young teenage 
audience, but it’s entertaining enough 
that someone else may continue to 
watch it without being too invested 
into the lives of each character like the 
targeted audience would. 
However, it was a struggle to figure 
out whether the topics of the show 

were suitable for a younger audience to be watching in the first 
place. As the girls train for the cheerleading competitions, several 
of them show clear symptoms of having an eating disorder, but none 
of them are called out for their unhealthy habits. For instance, one 
of the girls is seen bent over the toilet in an 
attempt to vomit, and when she struggles to 
do so, is kicked in the stomach by one of the 
cheerleaders to help her out. While it’s clear to 
healthy adults that this is abnormal behavior, 
it may not be to impressionable teenagers. 
The best way the show can succeed is to find 
the correct target audience, and as of now, 
it seems to be floating in a limbo between 
demographics. 
Like most other teen dramas, it’s the 
script that lacks the most attention and care. Each comeback and 
motivational quote is reused and recycled from other dramas, and 
if anything’s predictable about the show, it’s what each character is 
going to say next. With a script that hits harder and flows smoother, 
the show could likely draw itself in the direction of an upper teenage 
audience. As of now, “Dare Me” comes off as a coming-of-age story 
with toxic themes that tweens might have to avoid (depending on 
their current mindstates). There’s entertaining aspects of it for all 
adolescent age groups, but the task at hand remains in the hands of 
the creators, who need to determine the direction they want to take 
the show in and who they want to lock in as their target audience. 

For the gossip girls: ‘Dare Me’ is a ghost of teen dramas

In the final scene of “It’s a Wonderful Life,” George Bailey opens 
a copy of “Tom Sawyer” that was found under his Christmas tree. 
Written on the back of the cover is the inscription: “Remember 
no man is a failure who has friends.” As a crowd of loved ones 
sings “Auld Lang Syne,” George squeezes his young daughter and 
declares “That’s right!” He turns to the sky, winks and repeats, 
“That’s right.” 
For most of my life, Frank Capra’s (“It Happened One Night”) 
“It’s a Wonderful Life” has been synonymous with Christmas, my 
unequivocal favorite time of the year. It can’t be Dec. 25 until I’ve 
watched the movie one, two, sometimes three times, with a mug of 
hot chocolate in hand, surrounded by the balsam scents and white 
lights of my living room. 
Yet for a movie so associated with Christmas, it depicts very 
little of it. The majority of the film takes us through the life of 
George Bailey (James Stewart, “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington”), 
a selfless family man living in the quaint village of Bedford Falls. 
No matter how many times I’ve watched the film, I am astounded 
every time by just how much of it is dedicated to simply setting up 
George’s life. From a young boy to a grown man, you are shown how 
George has lived his entire life for the benefit of others. He jumps 
into icy water to save his little brother while they sled as children. 
He risks his job at a drug store as a teenager by not delivering pills 
he saw the distressed pharmacist accidentally fill with poison. He 
gives up his dream of going to college and traveling to take on the 
family building and loan business after his father dies.
Following this man through his life, it’s easy to become 
attached. Watching him experience love and pain, joy and despair, 
George becomes a living, breathing force jumping off the screen 
into real life. I know how the story starts and I know how it ends, 
but everytime I watch I feel myself praying for a happy ending, 
waiting for the moment that someone finally gives back.
But each time, nearing the end of the film, it seems that life 
has still not repaid George. As the film takes us into the present 
day, the Bailey Building and Loan business has been forced into 
thousands of dollars of debt. To pay off these debts with life 
insurance, George goes to a bridge on Christmas Eve to commit 
suicide. But somebody jumps before him, and George dives 
into the freezing river to save them. The man George rescued 
is Clarence — an angel, second class — and in order to earn his 

wings, Clarence must prove to George just how important his life 
has been for others.
The remainder of the movie shows how miserable everybody is 
in a world where George had never been born. His brother died 
in that icy water, the pharmacist went to jail and even Bedford 
Falls is not the same, now named after the avaricious banker that 
is trying to run George out of business.
For a movie entitled “It’s a Wonderful Life,” the majority of the 
film is quite dreary. Greed, suicide, war — these aren’t exactly the 
themes one would expect from a Christmas story. But that is what 
makes the story so real, so persistent. With every year I watch the 
film, with every new life experience, I understand George Bailey 
a little bit more. When I was a kid I didn’t know why George 
went to the bridge that night, but now I see. Misery doesn’t end 
when the holidays start, and 
even a life of selflessness can feel 
empty. Capra doesn’t sugar coat 
life they way the other candy-
colored Christmas movies do. 
The emotions from George Bailey 
and those who have come to love 
him are raw, breaking the surface 
of 
life’s 
unyielding 
struggles 
during a time of year they are 
most stifled. 
Perhaps it’s that desperate 
need for catharsis that makes 
the end of the movie so moving. 
As George returns to the bridge 
and cries desperately for his life 
back, snow begins to fall and he races through town, hugging and 
waving at everyone in his way. He returns home to a parade of 
people whose lives he touched, waiting to give him money to pay 
off his debts. A bell chimes on the family Christmas tree and his 
daughter utters the famous line: “Teacher says, every time a bell 
rings, and angel gets his wings.”
The story is one of classic Christmas feel-good victories, 
and like its protagonist, the movie itself also has somewhat of a 
comeback story. Following its release in 1946, “It’s a Wonderful 
Life” was a complete box office flop, to the point that it shuttered 
Frank Capra’s production company. Yet 30 years later, after 
someone forgot to file an updated copyright request, the movie 
became public domain and networks played it every day, every 
hour, during Christmastime.

Perhaps that’s the greatest allure of the movie: its timelessness. 
It’s been over 70 years since “It’s a Wonderful Life” was first 
released, but to this day, it gives family and friends occasion to 
squeeze together onto couches and under blankets to watch 
George Bailey’s story play out. Everybody wants to see themselves 
in George Bailey, in a world where nobody would be better off 
without their presence. Where everything one does somehow 
affects someone else which affects someone else, and so on. 
It’s a message even a toddler watching it for the first time in 
her grandparent’s basement can understand. Nobody’s life is 
worthless.
For 20 years I’ve been watching Frank Capra’s unlikely 
masterpiece in the lead up to Christmas. I don’t race my brother 
down the steps on Christmas morning anymore. My presents to 
family are bought with money 
from jobs rather than twisted 
together with construction paper 
and pipe cleaners. I’m too far 
away from home to help string up 
the lights, and there’s an empty 
seat at our Christmas table now.
The sad truth is that sometimes, 
it truly is a terrible life. There 
is pain, loss, helplessness. It is 
easy to look around and give up, 
to feel beaten by life. But the 
most important scenes in “It’s a 
Wonderful Life” aren’t the ones 
predicated on sacrifice and anger. 
They’re the silent promises to 
love someone until the day you die. The pocketing of petals to 
bring a young girl’s flower back to life. The quiet prayer muttered 
in a crowded bar. The decision to jump in to save someone else 
before you save yourself. Believing that even at the lowest point, 
there is hope.
As much as the world has changed since 1946, and as much as 
my life has changed since that first viewing, “It’s a Wonderful 
Life” has not gone away. I predict it never will. The human desire 
to feel needed transcends time and age. The six year old watching 
next to their grandmother may be inspired to reach out one more 
hand, to be kind to one more person. The grandmother may reflect 
on her many years, and be grateful for the good and the bad. Like 
the motto hanging in the Bailey office insists, “all you can take 
with you is that which you have given away.”

As I entered Literati, I walked by Grace Tulusan, author of “The Body 
Papers,” who sat in the back of the room with a small smile and an earnest 
glow in her eyes. The lights on the second floor of Literati Bookstore 
dimmed, and the seated audience murmured in quiet excitement as she 
weaved her way to the front. 
On her final stop on the book tour for her memoir “The Body Papers,” 
winner of the Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing author 
Grace Talusan began her talk with why she had to get these words out 
and onto a page. The catalyst was her niece’s 
eye cancer diagnosis, a reminder of life’s 
fickleness. It also served as a reminder that 
voices like hers mattered and needed to be 
heard. 
Talusan said she never considered herself 
worthy enough to be a protagonist. Growing 
up in the 1970s and 1980s in New England as 
a Filipina-American, she only ever saw her 
identity portrayed as a joke or caricature. 
As she began writing the essays that would 
eventually be compiled to become the memoir, 
Talusan wrote a story for her former and 
present self. At two, Talusan and her family 
immigrated to New England. In a mostly 
white town, the Philippines faded into a far-
away place people knew about because of the 
U.S. military bases set up there. 
In the excerpts Talusan read from her memoir, she unraveled the 
necessity detailing the immigrant experience. Otherwise, others would 
take over that narrative and misconstrue the truth. In a mixed-status 
family (having some documented and undocumented family members), 
Talusan’s family was granted a path to citizenship with an amnesty bill 
passed in the ’80s, a compassion toward immigrants she fears has been 
lost today. 
As one of the Filipina-Americans attending the lecture, it was almost 
unnerving hearing Tagalog words in public and having experiences to 
relate to. I rarely found books or any forms of art that I could culturally 
relate to. In this way, Talusan is the electrifying mouthpiece for the 

unseen and unacknowledged, especially those silenced by a society not 
made for them. Talusan, like so many other minorities in the U.S., lived 
that unwritten narrative and finally wrote it down. 
Talusan described the experience of being told that “Filipinos eat 
dogs” and discovering that Filipinos were on display at the 1904 World’s 
Fair in St. Louis. In a scrapbook during her research, she found a photo 
of her great-grandfather at the fair, playing the piccolo in a military 
parade, in what Talusan called America’s “ideal outcome of colonialism.” 
Talusan argued that assimilation becomes erasure, as even her parents 
told her to only speak English, eventually losing any Tagalog she knew. 
Talusan skillfully weaved her Filipinx identity with the anxieties of 
having her personal trauma public for the first time. 
“The Body Papers” is about the unsayable. 
Living with anxiety, depression and PTSD, 
Talusan feared the world and those she 
loved most would turn on her once the bomb 
exploded — once the truth that she was a 
survivor of abuse surfaced. She worried about 
how the people closest to her would react. 
A major support system for her, Talusan’s 
writing circle told her that there was no need 
to protect those who did not need protecting: 
Her abusers and those who didn’t believe 
her. In revealing her truth, Talusan hoped it 
helped survivors feel less alone. 
Her publisher warned her that “a book is a 
bomb.” Talusan joked that she initially heard 
“balm” instead of “bomb.” And when the 
memoir dropped, the bomb did explode and 
reverberate around the country and the world but not in the way she 
expected. Critically acclaimed but more importantly with the flood of 
love and gratitude from readers, Talusan was embraced by every person 
with a passion for words and for an understanding of the pains and joys 
of being human. 
In the process of crafting the memoir, Talusan learned to cultivate 
writing as a relationship with herself. Much of Talusan’s talk explored 
writing as a joyful and cathartic practice. An audience member asked 
what kept her writing, even if she was afraid. Talusan said her rage over 
why stories like hers are not out there fueled her. And, because, despite 
that anxiety and pain, it was writing that pulled her out of those depths 
every time, to realize the joy in living again.

In conversation with Grace Tulsan

NINA MOLINA
For The Daily

It’s that time of year again — Christmas trees sit outside of 
hardware stores and string lights line rooftops. Cookies are in the 
oven and carols on the speakers. The holidays are here! 
There are many things I love about December. Soft sweaters and 
fuzzy socks top the list, along with warm drinks and cozy nights. 
Behind the generalized jubilee, however, lies another 
reason for my Christmastime affection.
It’s Nutcracker season. It’s time for Sugar Plum Fairies 
and Snowflakes to grace almost every stage of the world, 
launching a yearly resurgence in the public’s proclivity for 
dance performance. 
Nutcracker season is the only month of the year when 
my love for ballet aligns with the rest of the world’s. For 30 
days, I revel in the same classical music as everyone else 
in Starbucks who hears it over the speakers. I see images 
of my beloved art form in the windows of Hallmark stores 
and on billboards on the side of the highway. I cherish 
this opportunity to share what I love so much with an 
audience that is so big. In a report from DanceUSA, “The 
Nutcracker” makes up an average of 48 percent of revenue 
for American ballet companies — that’s almost half their 
money from only one show. 
The story of “The Nutcracker,” like many ballet classics, 
is very odd. A little girl bursts into joyful dance upon 
receiving a weird nutcracker doll from her even weirder 
Uncle Drosselmeyer. Later that evening, she encounters a 

pack of life-size rats led by an evil Rat King trying to attack her for 
reasons that are completely unclear. She then watches as her doll 
turns into a life-size soldier and she ends up killing the Rat King by 
simply hitting him once on the head with her ballet slipper. After 
the rats leave, she flies off into a land of sweets with her nutcracker, 
who has now turned into a prince. 
Needless to say, no one goes to this show for the narrative. We are 
there for the beautiful music and Christmas themes, which is why 
the production has been successfully redesigned so many times. 

This statement then begs the question: Which is the best? Which 
choreography, whose costumes and what version of the story is 
most effective? 
Well, I quite like the Waltz of the Flowers by George Balanchine, 
and the Mother Ginger costume from Pacific Northwest Ballet. The 
San Francisco Ballet drops so much snow during their Waltz of the 
Snowflakes that it’s awe-inspiring to see the dancers able to keep 
moving without slipping. The Royal Ballet has a beautiful pas de 
deux (dance for two) in the first act and their Sugar Plum adagio at 
the end of the ballet is so well-matched to the grandeur of 
Tchaikovsky’s genius music that even watching it on my 
phone makes my heart swell. 
But that’s just me. The true beauty of Nutcracker lies 
in its accessibility. By nature of its mass production, 
December is the best time of year to go to the ballet. Even 
locally, you can see the Academy of Russian Ballet at the 
Michigan Theater on Dec. 14, or there’s a performance 
supported by the Ballet Detroit Foundation at the Lydia 
Mendelssohn Theatre on Dec. 15. Randazzo Dance 
Company will perform their version at the Power Center 
on Dec. 22 and you’re only a quick Google search away 
from finding dozens more possibilities in Ann Arbor’s 
neighboring towns. 
For many dancers, the Nutcracker will be their first or 
only chance to perform. For many audiences, it will be the 
first time they’ve seen a ballet. The intersection between 
these two firsts, underneath a flurry of snow and a dash of 
sugar plum sweetness, is often what makes this production 
so special.

Battle of the ‘Nutcrackers’: The holidays are for ballet

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

ZOE PHILLIPS
Daily Arts Writer

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

Just in case you’ve missed their steamy award show 
performances or flirty social media banter, I’ll break the news: 
Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes are an item. That’s why 
the title of Cabello’s sophomore effort, Romance, shouldn’t 
come as a surprise. Nor should the album’s content — a 
deep dive into Cabello’s rose-colored vision of love to the 
tune of anthemic pop. Luckily, however, it isn’t all lovey-
dovey as Cabello attempts to capture the dark, thrilling 
and painful aspects of romance whether you’re in it or not. 
“My emotions are naked, they’re taking me out of my 
mind,” Cabello confesses on “Shameless.” It’s the perfect 
track to plunge the listener into the emotional landscape 
of Romance and peek into Cabello’s headspace: nervous, 
overwhelmed and very much in love. The music itself feels 
heavy. Guitars close in on Cabello until she absolutely has 
to spill her feelings. 
If “Living Proof” is the aftermath of her shameless 
confession, the situation worked out in her favor. Cabello 
is blissful. Thematically, this song is the pickup line, “Did 
it hurt when you fell from heaven?” on steroids. “Where 
did you come from baby / and were you sent to save me?” 
she asks wide-eyed. In the chorus, Cabello’s voice reaches 
the heavenly heights she sings about, an impressive feat 
no matter how you feel about her gushing.
Cabello is 
more clear-
headed 
when 
fending 
off 
a 
former 
flame. 
“So you want 
me now? That’s 
funny / ‘Cause 
you didn’t give 
a … back then” 
she sings on the 
Latin 
inspired 
“Should’ve Said 

It.” It’s a much-needed dose of sass and suitable dance-alone-
in-your-room material.
“Feel It Twice” is the flip side of this poor timing. Cabello 
is sympathetic to the person she fell for “two years” ago, but 
who only just made up his mind about her now. “I know love 
is the loneliest place when you fall alone,” she sings from 
experience, but this time it’s her telling him she “doesn’t 
feel the same.” As the song builds, her voice echoes until 

Cabello and the listener both are overwhelmed by her rush 
of thoughts. 
Cabello wholeheartedly dives back into the sweet side of 
love on “Easy.” The message is straightforward — thinking 
that you’re “hard to love” until the right person makes it 
“seem so easy,” but Camila is playful about it. Her lover lists 
“her crooked teeth” as one of his favorite things about her and 
she coyly asks, “Anything else?” 
The only explicit track on the album, “This Love” finally 
gives Cabello some edge. “Fuck this love / Get out of my 
veins,” she cries. It’s the moment romance burns her and it’s 

refreshing. A subdued ode to the toxic person who plays her 
“again and again,” Cabello sounds just as passionate in love as 
in misery, if not more so. 
“I’ve known you forever / now I know you better” Cabello 
winks on “Used to This,” which chronicles Camila’s journey 
out of the friendzone with Shawn. It’s sweet, but it stands out 
for feeling real. Cabello grounds her feelings in experiences 
instead of the abstract. “No, I never liked San Francisco / 
never thought it was nothin’ 
special / ‘til you kissed me 
there” she admits. 
But out of all of the 
touchy-feely 
songs 
on 
Romance, 
Cabello’s 
song 
for her dad, “First Man,” 
takes the cake for being the 
mushiest. A piano ballad 
that follows her going on 
a date to walking down 
the aisle, she thanks her 
dad for being the “first

‘M’ TOPS OAKLAND DAYS AFTER BEATING ‘CUSE IN OT

Monday, December 9, 2019 | michigandaily.com

A grueling, late-night victory against one 

of the country’s most consistent powerhouses 

can leave a team limping unsuspectingly 

into a game two days later against a weaker 

in-state opponent, ripe to be upset.

Instead, Michigan’s momentum from 

the end of Thursday’s electric victory over 

Syracuse continued into Sunday as the 

24th-ranked Wolverines (8-1) muscled their 

way to a 79-64 win over Oakland (4-4).

The victory wasn’t without its struggles. 

A high-scoring first quarter ended in a tight 

22-21 lead for Michigan, but a strong second 

quarter gave the team essential breathing 

room to sustain its lead, coming into half up, 

40-28.

The Grizzlies narrowed the gap to four 

points with 2:18 left in the third quarter, going 

on a 13-4 run over the span of three minutes 

and missing only one shot.

Just as they did in the second quarter, 

though, the Wolverines slammed the door 

shut with offensive rebounds and second-

chance points, freezing the heat Oakland built 

up on the offensive end.

“I think just really making in-game 

adjustments, that’s the biggest thing coach 

has challenged us on,” said sophomore guard 

Amy Dilk. “Being able to recognize how a 

team is scoring, and then stopping that player 

or that set from executing.”

Despite the Grizzlies shooting 60 percent 

from the field in the first quarter and going 

3-for-4 from beyond the arc, Michigan kept 

pace by playing to two of its strengths — 

one emerging in its most recent matchups, 

another a season-long dominance.

The Wolverines forced seven turnovers 

in the first quarter, scoring 10 points off 

Oakland’s mistakes — eventually finishing 

with 29 points off turnovers. Senior forward 

Kayla Robbins, who is becoming one of the 

team’s most impressive defenders, had three 

steals in the first quarter.

Unlike the previous game, however, 

Michigan found its success without laying out 

its press-and-trap defense, instead reading the 

Grizzlies’ passes from the start. Dilk, senior 

guard Akienreh Johnson and Robbins all 

converted easy, full-court runs for layups.

On the offensive glass, nothing could stop 

the Wolverines, who tallied six offensive 

rebounds in the first quarter alone, totaling 

17 after 40 minutes. Freshman center Izabel 

Varejão, at one point, put up a layup and 

missed, but followed it up with a standing 

offensive rebound and a second-chance layup.

“I think that’s a strength of our team,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico. 

“(Johnson), (Robbins) and especially Naz 

(Hillmon) are just tremendous, tremendous 

offensive rebounders. So don’t get 

discouraged on that first shot not falling, but 

keep tracking it down.”

All told, the Wolverines showed they could 

bend, but not break, against a streaky offense 

that could hurt them from beyond the arc. 

And when they were pushed, they pushed 

back — going on an eight-point run to close 

out the third quarter.

Even with its overpowering starting five, 

Michigan needed its bench to spur on the 

starters who were dealing with their own set 

of nicks and bruises from the overtime affair 

on Thursday.

In the second quarter, freshman guard 

Maddie Nolan checked in and, after dishing 

a backward pass to Johnson, was standing 

alone, unguarded, in the corner. Johnson held 

onto the ball and took a long three as the shot 

clock wound down, bouncing off the front of 

the rim. Nolan anticipated the bounce and 

was all alone to collect the rebound, split two 

defenders and finished through contact.

As time wound down in the fourth quarter, 

junior guard Priscilla Smeenge caught fire 

and drained two 3-pointers and two layups.

“We were dragging a little bit, and we 

talked about it this morning, what can we 

change up if we need a little bit of a spark,” 

Barnes Arico said. “We talked about maybe 

putting (Smeenge) at the front of the press. 

She’s just so athletic. Having her run around 

a little bit and be annoying, and just give us a 

little bit of a lift.”

Added Smeenge: “We’ve had a lot of back-

to-back games these past couple days, like a 

lot of people were kind of tired and we had a 

lot of injuries coming into today’s game and so 

you never know when you’ve got to be ready 

when your number’s called. It was really 

exciting, I mean my teammates did a great job 

of finding me and having confidence in me to 

shoot it, so it was really helpful to have their 

support.”

The Wolverines ultimately avoided a 

collapse, springing forward and keeping 

momentum from Thursday’s win.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

T

he bowl game has 
become an annual meta-
phorical zombie for the 
Michigan 
football team. 
The team 
traverses to 
some warm, 
southern 
city, still wal-
lowing from 
the letdown 
weeks prior, 
patently 
unmotivated 
to face off 
against an SEC opponent. For 
the last three years, the Wol-
verines have taken their lumps, 
underperformed, then haphaz-
ardly spewed that next year will 
be different.
In some ways, it’s under-
standable. Expecting a bunch 
of college kids to recuperate 
from the most devastating loss 
of their lives to properly prepare 
for a glorified exhibition game 
is, perhaps, too idealistic. The 
equally-understandable fad of 
skipping bowl games so as to not 
risk injury (and poor game tape) 
doesn’t help.
This year could be the same. 
But Michigan has a unique 
opportunity here to make it dif-
ferent.
Saturday, it was announced 
that Michigan 
will head to 
Orlando, Fla. to 
face off with Ala-
bama in the Cit-
rus Bowl. This 
is not a Crimson 
Tide team on par 
with those of 
the recent past, 
with the injury 
to quarterback 
Tua Tagaviloa 
casting a pall over a forgettable 
season in Tuscaloosa. 
But it could be a game of 
euchre for all I care — if Jim 

Harbaugh and Michigan beat 
Nick Saban and Alabama in any-
thing, it will matter. It will mat-
ter for recruiting. It will matter 
to a downtrodden fanbase. It 
will matter for morale. It will 
matter as a springboard to next 
year.
“A very, very elite team,” Har-
baugh said on a conference call 
Sunday. “Our preparation will 
have to at its highest level. Good 
to know who you’re going to 
play and get started on prepar-
ing for the bowl game. Will be 
a big-time matchup. We’re very 
much looking forward to it.”
The Wolverines haven’t won 
a bowl game since 2015, a 41-7 
win over Florida, which provid-
ed a bridge from Year One of the 
Harbaugh era into a season that 
should have ended in a College 
Football Playoff berth. Opti-
mism was at an all-time high. It 
seemed a matter of if, not when, 
Harbaugh would bring this pro-
gram to glory.
Each year since that win in 
2015, Michigan has lost the last 
two games of its season. Har-
baugh has garnered a reputation 
for his team falling flat at the 
end of the season (a tad harsh, 
given one of those games is 
against Ohio State, a perennial 
CFP team, but still.)
Though you can scoff, a win 
against Alabama 
would give 
Michigan dou-
ble-digit wins for 
the fourth time 
in five years. The 
last time Michi-
gan had four 
double-digit-win 
seasons in five 
years? 1976-1980.
Dismiss that 
if you wish, 
but it’s a testament to both the 
understated success Harbaugh 
has had in getting the program 
back on track, and also the 

unreasonable expectations this 
fanbase places on him. It’s not 
unreasonable to expect a Big 
Ten title here and there, to be 
sure, but it’s willfully ignorant 
to blanketly chalk up his tenure 
to a failure.
Of course, there is the pos-
sibility — nay, the likelihood 
— that the Citrus Bowl will be 
nothing more than a superior 
team beating down an inferior 
one. The Crimson Tide are more 
talented at every position, per-
haps quarterback aside. Even in 
their worst year since 2010, they 
will be a double-digit favorite. 
As they should be.
But you want to do something 

that will quell mounting con-
cerns about the future of this 
program? Here 
you go. Beat the 
team that has 
won five of the 
last 11 national 
titles, the pro-
gram that has 
defined the last 
decade of college 
football and the 
coach who will 
go down as per-
haps the greatest 
to ever do it. More importantly, 
for the first time in Harbaugh’s 
five years in Ann Arbor, beat 
a team that is, on paper, more 

talented.
“My feeling about the team is 
we’re right there 
at the top,” Har-
baugh said after 
last year’s 41-15 
loss to Florida in 
the Peach Bowl. 
“But we have to 
put it over the 
top, especially 
in the big games 
at the end of the 
year.”
A win on 
New Year’s Day will do little 
to appease the necessity for 
this team to start beating Ohio 
State. It will not make Michigan 

de facto Big Ten champions. It 
will not secure anything in the 
future. It won’t drastically alter 
the trajectory of anything as it 
relates to this team’s standing in 
the national landscape.
But a win against Alabama 
will send Michigan to the 
offseason on a high note and 
restore some semblance of opti-
mism that brighter pastures lie 
ahead.
Optimism. Remember what 
that felt like?

Citrus Bowl provides unique opportunity

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
The Michigan football team will have a unique chance to salvage its season when it plays SEC powerhouse Alabama in the Citrus Bowl on New Year’s Day.

A very, very 
elite team. ... 
Will be a big-
time matchup.

My feeling 
about the team 
is we’re right 
there at the top.

For the No. 22 Michigan 
women’s volleyball team, the 
NCAA 
Division 
I 
Women’s 
Volleyball Championship was 
a tale of two games — one in 
which the Wolverines were 
dominant and one in which they 
got dominated. In the last two 
games of the season, Michigan 
swept and got swept by two 
teams in Kentucky to to end its 
2019 campaign. 
Michigan (21-11) made its 
13th appearance in the NCAA 
Tournament in the last 14 
years and its 19th tournament 
appearance overall — 18 of them 
with Michigan coach Mark 
Rosen. The Wolverines were 
placed in the region hosted by 
No. 9 Kentucky, a tough matchup 
if it came to be. Michigan 
traveled to Lexington, Ken. to 
first compete against Northern 
Kentucky (19-13) in the first 
round. The Wolverines handled 
business, finishing off the Norse 
in a clean, three-set sweep. 
“It’s good to advance, it’s 
good to move forward,” Rosen 
said. 
“I 
thought 
Northern 
Kentucky played really well … 
Proud of our players for taking 
care of that and moving on. 
Excited about it.”
Michigan started out the 
match struggling in the first set, 
hitting just .167. Unfortunately 
for Northern Kentucky, though, 
the Norse hit even worse and 
were unable to take advantage of 
the Wolverines’ early struggles 
— losing the set, 25-22. Michigan 
bounced back, improving its 
hitting percentage to .370 in the 
second set and .342 in the third 
set, winning both, 25-15 and 
25-22, respectively. 
Freshman 
middle 
blocker 
Jess 
Robinson 
and 
senior 
middle blocker Cori Crocker led 
the attack with a .500 hitting 
mark, each having at least eight 
kills. 
“Both her (Crocker) and Jess, 
I thought did a great job,” Rosen 
said. “Both middles hit .500. 
They were two and three in kills 

for us … I thought that that was 
great that we had that option to 
go to when our outsides were 
struggling, and it was great that 
we passed the ball well enough 
to get them the ball.”
When 
asked 
about 
her 
success, Crocker credited her 
teammates for her success — 
something she has done all 
season.
“I’m not here without her 
(senior setter MacKenzi Welsh) 
being here for sure,” Crocker 
said. “I think she definitely got 
me in positions to put the ball 
away.”
Welsh, a key contributor 
for the Wolverines all season, 
led the team with 36 assists. 
Setters serve as the core of 
any volleyball team and Rosen 
believes it helps that Michigan 
had a senior with experience at 
that position.
“The 
nice 
thing 
is 
our 
seniors have been in the NCAA 
Tournament four years in a 
row,” Rosen said. “It’s awesome 
to have a senior who’s played in 
an NCAA experience to be the 
one who steps in.”
The Wolverines had a tough 
turnaround after their first 
round game on Friday as they 
faced No. 9 Kentucky (25-6) 
the next day. Heading into the 
matchup, the Wildcats’ success 
could 
be 
largely 
attributed 
to their outside hitter and 
SEC Player of the Year, Leah 
Edmond, and SEC Libero of the 
Year, Gabby Curry. Kentucky 
proved 
too 
much 
for 
the 
Wolverines, winning in three 
sets and ending Michigan’s 
season. 
“They run a good tempo, it’s 
fast,” Rosen said. “We had a 
pretty good idea of what they 
were doing, we just didn’t do 
a very good job of stopping it 
… There were times we played 
well, but there were times where 
we were very inconsistent with 
out offense … It’s not a good 
combination. 
They 
certainly 
outplayed us today.”
Michigan failed to hit over 
.200 and averaged .146 for all 
three sets. Kentucky, on the 

other hand, hit the ball at the 
.323 mark — including a .438 
hitting percentage in the second 
set. Edmond and outside hitter 
Alli Stumler led the charge 
offensively for the Wildcats, 
with 15 and 11 kills respectively. 
Curry also made her impact felt 
with a match-high 19 digs. 
Sophomore 
outside 
hitter 
Paige Jones led both teams 
with a match-high of 16 kills 
and Crocker led all players 
with a game-high of .500 
hitting percentage, but those 
performances weren’t enough 
to overcome the juggernaut 
Wildcats. 
It wasn’t the way Michigan 
wanted to end its season and 
send its seniors off, but it was 
the goodbye that they got. 
“This team’s worked really, 
really hard to become the best 
version of themselves they can 
be,” Rosen said. “So, I’m really 
proud of how hard this team 
worked and how committed 
they were to our process and 
really developing as a team … 
I really am super proud of this 
team and very appreciative 
of 
what 
they’ve 
done 
for 
our program and Michigan 
athletics.”

Out of the 16 games in the 
second round of the NCAA 
Women’s Volleyball Tournament, 
only three were won by lower 
seeded teams — and Michigan 
was not one of them.
After 
sweeping 
Northern 
Kentucky (19-13) Friday night, the 
22nd-ranked Wolverines (21-11) 
fell to No. 11 Kentucky (25-6) in 
straight sets Saturday night, as the 
Wildcats out-hit Michigan, .323 to 
.146, and sided-out over 15 percent 
higher.
But this was expected. The 
Wolverines 
were 
supposed 
to 
beat 
Northern 
Kentucky. 
Michigan was supposed to lose 
to Kentucky. That is exactly how 
the Wolverines’ season has gone, 
nearly without fail; they have 
beaten the teams they were meant 
to beat and have lost to the teams 
they were meant to lose to. 
Michigan’s record against the 
five Big Ten teams that finished 
above it in the standings — 
Wisconsin, Nebraska, Minnesota, 
Penn State and Purdue — was a 
combined 0-7. Its record against 
the eight teams that ranked below 
it? 13-0.

So when the Wolverines arrived 
in Lexington, Kentucky for their 
fifth-straight NCAA tournament 
appearance, the outcome was all-
but decided. They were going to 
beat Northern Kentucky in the 
school’s 
first-ever 
tournament 
berth, and they were going to lose 
to Kentucky, which touted the 
SEC player of the year and libero 
of the year — Leah Edmond and 
Gabby Curry, respectively.
But that doesn’t mean that 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen was 
disappointed in the outcome. 
“I’m really proud of this 
team,” Rosen said. “Tonight’s a 
frustrating night. It’s a difficult 
night but when you get to a point 
like this when the season’s coming 
to an end. I think you have to look 
at the big picture, and the big 
picture is this group. This group 
came a long way … I’m really 
proud of how far they’ve come. 
I think that I couldn’t be more 
appreciative of what this group’s 
done.”
The group did what it was 
supposed to be able to do — no 
more, no less. And now, after 
the season is over, Rosen and its 
players will move on to the next 
season, but not without any losses.
The Wolverines are losing 

seven seniors — out of 18 total 
players on the roster — four of 
which started in the weekend’s 
NCAA tournament matches. This 
includes Big Ten first-team setter, 
MacKenzi Welsh and Big Ten 
second-team middle blocker Cori 
Crocker. In a large senior class, 
the loss is sizeable, but the seniors 
aren’t leaving without making 
their mark. 
“I thought this group really did 
a great job of stepping up to be 
senior leaders and senior veterans 
and really set a great course for 
our young players coming in,” 
Rosen said. “It’s been a great 
group.”
The young group is anchored 
by sophomore outside hitter Paige 
Jones. In only her second season, 
she was unanimously named 
to the All-Big Ten First Team 
and leads Michigan in kills and 
service aces. 
Among the freshman, outside 
hitter 
May 
Pertofsky 
and 
middle blocker Jess Robinson 
were named to the Big Ten All-
Freshman 
team 
after 
strong 
freshman seasons. This group 
also includes players that haven’t 
seen the court as much this year, 
but show promise. Players such 
as freshman defensive specialist 
Amber Beals who got her chance 
to prove herself against Kentucky.
“We were subbing a lot in the 
sets, more than me normally 
do,” Rosen said. “Unfortunately 
it didn’t work, but I thought the 
players that went in really were 
ready to go in and try to get an 
impact, and I thought Amber did 
a great job.” 
At the end of a season that went 
as expected, Rosen looks forward 
to his 22nd season as Michigan’s 
head coach and looks to a core of 
young players to fill the positions 
left open by the graduating seniors 
— but not without reflecting first.
“I think they’ve been a really 
fun team to work with,” Rosen 
said. “They work hard every 
day. They’re good personalities. 
They’re team players. So I really 
am super proud of this team 
and very appreciative of what 
they’ve done for our program and 
Michigan athletics.”

In drawing matchup with Alabama, Harbaugh and Michigan get a chance they wouldn’t otherwise have in the bowl game

December 9, 2019 — 3B

All game, the No. 4 Michigan 
men’s basketball team had one 
roadblock to an otherwise easy 
win: Iowa big man Luka Garza.
On his way to an astounding 
44 points, Garza was a force to 
be reckoned with in the low post, 
dominating in his back-to-the-
basket play. The Wolverines (8-1 
overall, 1-0 Big Ten) saw early that 
Iowa’s (6-3, 0-1) offense started and 
stopped with Garza, but they were 
helpless to stop it.
In the end, it didn’t matter, 
seeing as Michigan’s offense was 
firing on all cylinders and strode 
past the Hawkeyes en route to a 
103-91 win on Friday night. 
Seemingly every time the ball 
touched his hands, Garza was 
unstoppable in his efforts to put 
the ball in the basket. By the end 
of the game, Iowa’s offense felt 
unmistakingly routine. Push the 
ball up the floor. Get it to Garza. 
Garza goes up for two points. 
Repeat.
“Well, he’s a guy who’s got 
a ton of different moves,” said 
Iowa coach Fran McCaffrey. “I 
thought we did a really good job 
of getting him the ball, made a 
concerted effort to do so. He never 
stops moving. He sprints hard in 
transition and posts hard, so he’s 
a handful for any defender who’s 
trying to guard him.”
The 
Wolverines’ 
response 
seemingly 
prioritized 
keeping 
their big men out of foul trouble 
as opposed to making Garza’s 
path to a bucket as difficult as it 
could’ve been. Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard was operating 
under a near auto-bench policy 
for his big men after picking up a 
foul with senior center Jon Teske, 
sophomore center Colin Castleton 
and senior center Austin Davis all 
seeing the floor.
Teske, known for his defensive 
prowess in the lane, picked up four 
fouls and was unable to contain 
Garza’s post presence. Castleton 
and Davis fared much the same 
throughout the game.

Fouls were a recurring problem 
for the Wolverines, with the 
team picking up 19 in the game 
and Teske and Simpson both in 
foul trouble. The crowd at Crisler 
Center looked to be a factor in the 
game, letting the refs hear their 
discontent following every blow of 
the whistle — a number that kept 
building for Michigan’s key players.
On the other side of the court, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense 
was 
everything that it lacked in its first 
loss of the season against Louisville 
last 
Tuesday. 
Senior 
guard 
Zavier Simpson was effective in 
distributing the ball, totaling seven 
assists and the team found its 
offensive balance again with shots 
falling from behind the arc and the 
guards feeding the big men down 
low to get points in the paint.
Everyone got in the action, too, 
with six of Michigan’s players 
scoring in double digits. The 
Wolverines got there by taking 
advantage of Iowa’s lax zone 
defense and were able to find lots 
of easy looks in the paint. Leading 
the charge was freshman forward 
Franz Wagner led the charge with 
18 points — nine of which came 
from the free throw line.
“I shot like 10 free throws, so I 
got to the line,” Wagner said. “It’s 
always good to find a rhythm. I 
just try to take what the defense 
gives me, just getting to the basket 
helped us today, getting some easy 
ones early.”
The bench players provided 
a spark in the game offensively, 
highlighted by sophomore forward 
Brandon Johns Jr. who led the 
team at half with 10 points and 
finished with 12. After coming into 
the game in the middle of the first 
half, Johns drilled two 3-pointers 
and threw down a ferocious slam 
upon entering in the second. Johns 
was also a menace on the glass, 
totaling eight rebounds.
On a night where Michigan’s 
defense wasn’t up to the task, its 
offense carried the load.
“Well, we played with pace,” 
Howard said. “One thing that we 
did not do was just walk the ball up 
the floor. We knew that they were 

gonna come with a lot of pace, too … 
Just kept encouraging our guys to 
stay in the moment. Can’t celebrate 
after a bucket, get back, and make 
sure you talk on defense, so on the 
offensive end, we’re able to get out 
in transition.”
This mentality manifested itself 
with Davis’ play. With Castleton 
sitting after taking an elbow to the 
face in the first half, Davis got the 
crowd excited with back-to-back 
dunks later in the second half, then 
sprinted down to the other end of 
the floor rather than revel in his 
play. 
The difference in the offensive 
performance for the Wolverines 
came down to Simpson’s ability to 
control the game from halfcourt 
as well as the other guards finding 
success controlling the basketball 
and finding good taking advantage 
of Iowa’s zone defense.
Simpson picked up three quick 
fouls in the half’s opening four 
minutes, but quick to respond, 
junior guard Eli Brooks drove to 
the lane and found a wide-open 
Teske for the easy slam.
When it was all said and done, 
Garza was left with nothing to 
show for his legendary numbers 
other than a spot in Iowa’s record 
books.

Michigan teams of years 
past have at times tended 
to rely on a few players 
– the Jordan Pooles and 
Moritz Wagners – for much 
of their success. But so far 
this season, the fourth-
ranked 
Wolverines 
have 
been winning more on the 
strength of the many than 
the success of a few. Friday 
night’s 103-91 win over 
Iowa, their first conference 
matchup and Big Ten victory 
of the season, was the 
perfect example. 
“I saw great production 
out of (the bench) tonight,” 
said Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard. “I saw them playing 
with a lot of energy, a ton 
of effort, and just playing 
inspiring basketball. It was 
great to see that.”
Some 
of 
the 
most 
impactful players weren’t 
starters on Friday night. 
Sophomore 
center 
Colin 
Castleton has also seen his 
fair share of time off the 
bench this season, especially 
when senior center Jon Teske 

has been in foul trouble, and 
he looked good when Teske 
again racked up a few fouls 
early 
before 
exiting 
the 
game to get stitches in his 
lip.
But bench players with 
less 
in-game 
experience 
were just as much of a 
factor in the game. With 
Teske in foul trouble and 
Castleton injured, redshirt 
junior forward Austin Davis 
saw 
extended 
playing 
time for the first time this 
season. Sophomore guard 
Brandon Johns Jr. saw more 
minutes 
than 
he 
normally 
does as well. 
Davis 
had 
eight 
points 
and 
three 
rebounds 
on 
the night and 
put up a dunk 
from 
behind 
the net around 
the 
eight-
minute 
mark 
and two more on either 
side of the seven-minute 
mark, to the delight of the 
fans in the crowd at Crisler 
Center. Johns accounted for 

12 points – his first career 
double digit night and a 
new career high – and threw 
down a massive dunk of his 
own at the 12-minute mark.
“Before the game, I was 
really thinking to myself, I 
can contribute more,” Johns 
said. “I can help out my 
teammates – just being out 
there on the floor. I’m not 
doing 
anything 
different. 
The rebounding’s good, for 
sure, but I felt like I can be 
there – I can be a presence 
on both ends, so I always just 
really want to be aggressive, 
on 
offense 
and defense.” 
It 
was 
a 
stark contrast 
to 
the 

Hawkeyes, 
whose 
nine-
man rotation 
was 
about 
what 
the 
Wolverines 
had expected 
it 
to 
be. 
Michigan looked effective 
all night on defense, even 
successfully putting a lid 
on Iowa’s star guard, senior 
Jordan Bohannon. 
Although the bench lacks 
size to a certain extent, with 
the exception of Davis, a 
6-foot-10 behemoth, and 
especially compared to both 
Michigan’s 
starters 
and 
Iowa’s very physical team, 
the defense was solid all 
night, no matter who was 
on the floor. Michigan held 
Iowa to just 20 percent on 
their 3-point attempts and 
came up with 38 rebounds in 
a dominant first conference 
victory.
“We have this motto on 
our team: ‘Stay ready so you 
don’t have to get ready,’” 
Howard said. “That’s how 
our guys responded tonight. 
I’m just so proud of their 
effort.”
Although there have been, 
and certainly will continue 

Hawk hunters

Garza raises questions about defense

As the modern style of men’s 
basketball continues to evolve 
with an emphasis on 3-point 
shooting, 
teams 
across 
the 
collegiate 
and 
professional 
ranks 
have 
ditched 
the 
traditional ‘5.’
But not in the Big Ten, and 
not in Ann Arbor.
In a conference ruled by some 
of the country’s most talented 
big men, traditional centers are 
alive and well. The short list of 
testaments includes Michigan’s 
Jon Teske, Iowa’s Luka Garza, 
Ohio State’s Kaleb Wesson, 
Purdue’s Matt Haarms, Illinois’ 
Kofi 
Cockburn, 
Minnesota’s 
Daniel Oturu and Penn State’s 
Mike Watkins.
In Friday night’s 103-91 win 
over the Hawkeyes, the fourth-
ranked Wolverines saw the 
impact of a dominant Big Ten 
center firsthand. Garza entered 
the game as the nation’s only 
Power Five player averaging 
20 points and 10 rebounds, 
and promptly poured in a 
career-high 44 points against 
Michigan.
Garza 
showcased 
one 
of 
the 
conference’s 
best 
low-
post repertoires Friday night, 
using his full arsenal of reverse 
layups, post hooks and mid-
range jumpers to record the 
third-most 
points 
in 
Iowa 
history.
“He’s a guy that’s got a 
ton 
of 
different 
moves,” 
said Hawkeyes’ coach Fran 
McCaffery after the game. “I 
thought we did a really good 
collectively of getting him the 
ball, (we) made a concerted 
effort to do so. He never stops 
moving, he sprints hard in 
transition and posts hard, so 
he’s a handful for any defender 
that’s trying to guard him.”
Throughout the night, the 
Wolverines had no answer for 
Garza. Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard initially tried stopping 
him by assigning three different 
defenders, but when Teske, 
sophomore 
forward 
Colin 
Castleton and senior center 
Austin Davis tried their hand at 
halting Garza’s big night, they 

found themselves out-muscled 
or in foul trouble. Castleton, 
in particular, took an errant 
elbow to the face that required 
stitches on his lip before he 
made a second-half return.
By 
halftime, 
Garza 
had 
already racked up 27 points. 
He was responsible for 11 of 
Iowa’s 15 field goals, while 
24 of its 38 points came in 
the paint. Howard tried to 
draw up different defensive 
assignments, traps and double-
teams against Garza, but none 
of it seemed to matter.
“We were just trying to make 
it tough on (Garza),” Davis said. 
“Tough to get the ball, tough 
once he got it, just tried to make 
it as hard on him to score as 
possible. … We know he’s a great 
player, we knew that coming 
in.”
Friday could very well have 
been an outlier. Regardless of 
whether it was, Michigan is in 
a good place to learn from it. 
The Wolverines’ porous interior 
defense allowed Iowa to post 91 
points, even as it shot just 3-of-
15 from beyond the arc. With an 
influx of frontcourt depth this 
season, it’s best to learn such a 
lesson in December as opposed 
to March.
At 7-foot-1, Teske has been 
an impactful paint presence 
since stepping into the starting 
center role last season. He’s 
averaging 
2.1 
blocks 
per 
game across 46 starts, while 
Castleton is averaging just over 
two rejections per 36 minutes in 
his career to date.
But their real value lies in 
altering close-range looks with 

their 
size. 
Against 
driving 
guards 
and 
fellow 
centers 
around the rim, the presence 
of Teske or Castleton often 
forces 
opposing 
players 
to 
take off-balanced shots from 
uncomfortable angles.
Without a reliable backup 
center last season, there was 
pressure on Teske to remain 
on the floor. That wasn’t the 
case the season before, when he 
averaged just 12.3 minutes while 
playing behind Moritz Wagner. 
Teske’s minutes more than 
doubled 
following 
Wagner’s 
departure, which brought about 
a necessary learning curve in 
staying out of foul trouble.
He 
answered 
the 
call, 
improving from one foul per 
7.6 minutes to 12.6 minutes, 
but Michigan still struggled 
without him on the floor. 
After beginning the season as 
the primary backup center, 
Davis fell out of the rotation as 
Castleton and forward Brandon 
Johns Jr. spent much of their 
freshman seasons adjusting to 
the college level.
This 
season, 
though, 
Michigan is better equipped 
to weather stretches without 
Teske than it was a season 
ago. And as a result, he and 
the centers behind him are 
afforded the luxury of defensive 
aggression.
With a long line of strong Big 
Ten centers on the upcoming 
docket, 
that 
aggression 
has to become a staple of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
interior 
defense. 
Otherwise, 
Garza’s 
performance could be just the 
beginning.

‘M’ finishes second in crowded field

While there was an admitted 
talent gap between the Michigan 
women’s swim and dive team and 
its rivals, the Wolverines relied on 
long-term development to power 
past more highly-ranked opponents 
at this weekend’s Minnesota Invite. 
No. 19 Michigan came in second 
out of seven, falling 422.5 points 
shy of first-place No. 3 California.
Michigan (3-0) came out of the 
weekend with 10 top-three finishes 
and seven athletes qualifying for 
NCAA Championships. 
The second-place finish was 
better than Michigan coach Mark 
Bottom was expecting facing the 
Golden Bears, No. 5 Texas and 
other top teams. 
Bottom had reason be worried 
after losing a dominant senior 
class last spring, comprised of 
Siobhán Haughey, Catie DeLoof 
and Jamie Yeung, who led the 
team to a third-place finish at the 
NCAA Finals. But after this week, 
it’s clear this won’t be a rebuilding 
year for the Wolverines. The 
team’s depth was evident in its 
relay — made up of seniors Chloe 
Hicks and Miranda Tucker, as well 
as junior Daria Pyshnenko and 
sophomore Maggie MacNeil — in 
which they placed third behind 
California and the Longhorns.
Junior diver Christy Cutshaw 

secured valuable points for the 
team with her first-place finish on 
the platform dive. 
In recent years, Michigan has 
been a dominant program, but 
has yet to best the Golden Bears in 
the postseason. Bottom attributes 
the gap to different levels of 
recruiting. California typically 
has a top-10 recruiting class in 
the county, while the Wolverines 
focus on developing their athletes 
once they get to Ann Arbor — a 
strategy Bottom thinks will be 
integral to the team’s future 
success. 

“We recruit well and develop 
greater athletes,” Bottom said. 
“That’s kind of what we’ve done 
in the past and will continue to 
do. We won’t always get the best 
athletes — as a matter of fact, we 
get very few, but we get some and 
we develop a great team.”
That development seems to 
have paid off. Friday, MacNeil tied 

the NCAA and U.S. Open records 
on the 100-yard butterfly with a 
time of 49.26 seconds. While she 
already has a lot to show for her 
time at Michigan, including the 
Big Ten of the Year accolade and 
four Big Ten Championship titles, 
Bottom stresses that MacNeil’s 
success is a product of the work 
she’s put in since joining the team. 
“She 
didn’t 
come 
in 
a 
superstar,” Bottom said. “She 
came in a good swimmer, just like 
a lot of our girls. They have hope 
that they can achieve some of the 
things she’s achieved. She’s real 
good about understanding where 
she came from and encouraging 
others to follow that path.” 
Many other members of the 
team followed MacNeil’s lead, 
setting 
personal-best’s 
and 
approaching school-wide records. 
Hicks clocked in at 1:53.12 minutes 
on 
the 
200-yard 
backstroke, 
trumping her previous record by 
almost 10 seconds. Pyshnenko 
just edged out her previous record 
of 50.20 seconds on the 100-yard 
freestyle with a time of 48.12. 
“We’re getting better, and 
that’s what we want to do,” 
Bottom said. “Every time we get 
to a mid-season meet like this, 
the idea is that you want to be as 
close to your best in season times 
and better than last year’s end of 
season times. That’s where we’re 
moving.”

Wolverines fall to Nittany Lions, 3-1

Almost. 
The Michigan hockey team 
(6-10-2 overall, 2-7-1-0 Big Ten) 
almost completed a comeback 
against No. 6 Penn State (12-
5-0, 7-3-0-0). And if it had, the 
comeback 
would’ve 
marked 
the first time this season the 
Wolverines were able to do so, 
amid their first Big Ten sweep.
Instead, the game followed the 
same trajectory that can sum up 
the first half of the Wolverines’ 
season — they played well enough 
to win, but ultimately couldn’t 
finish the job.
“We 
played 
hard,” 
said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. “All 
we can do is ask our players to 
give it their best and lay it on the 
line and walk out of here knowing 
they did that. I don’t know if we 
can play much better than we did 
tonight. We fought our way back 
from that two-goal deficit, and 
I thought in the third period, we 
were the best team.” 
But really, the Wolverines had 
sealed their fate by the time the 
first period ended. The Nittany 
Lions nabbed a 2-0 lead heading 
into intermission, and though the 
Wolverines responded quickly, it 
wasn’t enough. When the clock 
expired at Yost Ice Arena, the 
scoreboard favored Penn State 
over Michigan, 3-1. 
The Wolverines’ two-minute 
struggle started when they took 
a penalty for too many men on 
the ice. It happened while senior 
defenseman Griffin Luce was 
heading off the ice for a line 
change.
His 
replacement, 
freshman 
defender Keaton Pehrson, had 
already come over the boards. 
Luce was a just a step from the 
bench when the puck ricocheted 
off the boards and hit his skate. 
The referee blew his whistle — 
and for the third time that period, 
Michigan was going to have to kill 
a penalty. The Wolverines had 
successfully killed the Nittany 
Lions’ first two opportunities, 
and they hoped to continue their 
shutdown of Penn State’s power 
play.
But these hopes were thwarted 
18 seconds later, when Nittany 

Lions forward Nate Sucese buried 
a one-timer to beat sophomore 
goaltender Strauss Mann.
In the wake of Sucese’s goal, 
Michigan needed to regroup and 
badly. But it would have to wait for 
the intermission, because barely a 
minute after the first goal, Penn 
State extended its lead to 2-0.
There 
were 
just 
seconds 
remaining when Nittany Lions 
forward Evan Barratt found the 
puck at the top right side of the 
crease. Carrying the puck on his 
stick, he danced around Mann 
and finished on a wide open net.
“I think that was just a lapse,” 
said redshirt junior forward Luke 
Morgan about the second goal. 
“We took the penalty, that’s tough, 
and they score (while we’re) 
shorthanded. We might have put 
our foot off the gas at the end of 
the period a little bit. You can’t do 
that. They capitalized on that.”
Then, when the puck dropped 
to signal the start of the second 
period, Michigan mustered a 
quick response to the Nittany 
Lions’ late offensive push.
The 
Wolverines 
pushed 
into the offensive zone off the 
opening drawing. Junior forward 
Michael Pastujov found himself 
in the middle of a battle along the 
boards. Pastujov was checked by 
a defender and lost his balance 
but not before he threw the puck 
across the ice and toward the goal. 
Simultaneously, redshirt junior 
Luke Morgan streaked towards 
the net.
Pastujov’s pass crossed his 
path, and in one fluid motion, 
Morgan rifled the puck into 
the goal. With Morgan’s goal, 
Michigan inched closer to a 
comeback, but still trailed, 2-1.
“It was huge,” said senior 
forward Will Lockwood. “You 
could just tell, the momentum 
swung there. That was really big 
for us. I’m really surprised we 
didn’t get another. I think if we 
got that next one, got that bounce, 
we would’ve won the game, no 
doubt. Unfortunately, that didn’t 
happen, but that first goal was big 
for us.”
As the storyline has been 
all season, the Wolverines had 
chances, but didn’t finish them. 
They outshot Penn State in both 
the second and third periods, 

tallying a total of 43 shots on net. 
But none of these chances crossed 
the goal line, none of them aided 
the attempted comeback.
With time running out, and 
Michigan still applying pressure, 
still searching for an equalizer, 
still looking to prove it could 
stage a comeback Pearson made 
the decision to pull Mann for an 
additional attacker.
It almost worked. As Mann 
skated to the bench, Pastujov 
climbed over the board and skated 
into the offensive zone. Fifty 
second later, he was faced with 
an open net, as the Penn State 
goaltender was sprawled on the 
ice. Pastujov fired a shot. It went 
just over the crossbar. 
The Wolverines had almost 
tied the game. 
But not even twenty seconds 
later, Nittany Lions forward Denis 
Smirnov shot the puck into the 
empty and made the score 3-1.
As the teams lined up to shake 
hands, the Wolverines’ ability 
to respond quickly to adversity 
didn’t matter. All their offensive 
opportunities didn’t count for 
anything more than stats in a 
column. 
When the game ended, the 
score sheet favored Penn State 
and though Michigan almost 
staged a comeback, the only thing 
reflected in the stats was how 
damaging its two-minute mental 
lapse proved to be.

Offense falls short in Penn State loss

Standing just below the left 
circle, Michael Pastujov received 
a pass from Jacob Hayhurst 
behind the net. In an instant, 
without wasting time settling 
the puck for a shot, Pastujov 
snapped a wrist shot toward the 
mouth of the goal.
Penn 
State’s 
goaltender, 
Peyton Jones, lied prone in the 
crease as Michigan applied 
pressure. It looked as though 
Pastujov was going to find twine 
and tie the game at two goals 
apiece with just over a minute 
left. The Wolverines even began 
to celebrate as the puck flew 
toward the net, thinking there 
was no way it wouldn’t be a goal. 
Pastujov was quick with his 
release, and he had a wide-open 
target to shoot at.
But instead, somehow, some 
way, Jones got a piece of the 
puck, deflecting it high and 
neutralizing the scoring chance.
Seventeen 
seconds 
later, 
forward 
Denis 
Smirnov 
hit 
the empty net to make it a 3-1 
game with under a minute left. 
Michigan’s chance at coming 
back and getting the sweep was 
gone.
“It’s kind of just been the 
same story all year,” said senior 
forward Will Lockwood. “Guys 
just gotta bear down on chances, 

including myself, and that’s 
just a mindset. We gotta come 
in with that mindsight right at 
the beginning, but I think we’re 
doing a lot of the right things.”
Throughout Saturday’s game, 
the Wolverines struggled to 
finish on scoring opportunities. 
And 
as 
Lockwood 
said, 
Michigan’s offense has told 
the same story throughout the 
season.
Through 
their 
18 
games 
this season, the Wolverines 
rank third in the nation with 
584 shots on goal. Their shot 
percentage, however, is 58th out 
of 60 teams at just 6.7 percent. 
The numbers state it about as 
plainly as anything could — 
Michigan just cannot find the 
back of the net. In Saturday’s 
matchup, the Wolverines put 43 
shots on net and attempted 68 in 
total.
They scored only one goal.
“We continue to struggle 
scoring goals,” said Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson. 
“Last 
night, we didn’t score on our 
best chances. You saw we got 
four, and we could’ve had nine. 
Tonight, we could’ve had I don’t 
know how many.”
And it isn’t a matter of not 
getting opportunities, as the 
Wolverines’ third place shot 
total 
demonstrates. 
Every 
game, players fail to convert on 
Grade-A scoring chances.

Saturday, 
that 
stood 
out 
about as much as it has all 
year. Throughout the lineup, 
Michigan missed chance after 
chance.
Senior forward Jake Slaker 
was stopped by Jones on a one-
on-one breakaway from point-
blank 
range. 
Jones 
stopped 
sophomore 
forward 
Garrett 
Van Wyhe that way, too. Late in 
the game, when Pearson pulled 
sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann to give the Wolverines an 
extra attacker, they continued 
to fail to execute on scoring 
opportunities.
Pastujov missed the best look 
Michigan had with the extra 
attacker, and freshman forward 
Johnny Beecher had a couple 
chances of his own that couldn’t 
find the back of the net.
In the third period, Michigan 
outshot Penn State, 19-10, but 
couldn’t get a goal out of it.
“We probably had as many 
good chances this weekend as 
we’ve had all year, against a team 
that has played well defensively,” 
Pearson said. “Against a team 
who likes to spend a lot of time — 
I don’t think we spent much time 
in our zone in the third period 
when the game’s on the line.”
Even earlier in the game, 
when 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
attempting to battle back from 
a one-goal deficit, Michigan 
demonstrated an inability to 
convert on chances. Sophomore 
forward Jimmy Lambert had 
two open looks on the power play 
in the second period. Hayhurst, 
too, had multiple chances on 
the doorstep of the crease and 
couldn’t punch the puck in.
And 
as 
the 
Wolverines 
continue to try to dig themselves 
out of last place in the Big 
Ten, the offense needs to find 
a 
rhythm. 
Michigan 
hasn’t 
won this year when it’s scored 
less than four goals, and the 
Wolverines average just 2.17 
goals per game.
It’s 
becoming 
clear 
that 
without the offense finding a 
way to light the lamp, this team 
will continue to struggle at the 
bottom of the conference.
“We have to score goals,” 
Pearson said. “And we’re not 
doing that.”

Sophomore forward Nolan Moyle was one of many Wolverines to struggle in Saturday’s 3-1 loss to Penn State.

‘M’ to play Alabama in Citrus Bowl

Ever yelled “We want Bama” as 
a joke when Michigan had a good 
game? Well, you got your wish.
It’s official: the 14th-ranked 
Wolverines will be headed to 
Orlando to play No. 13 Alabama in 
the Citrus Bowl on New Year’s Day.
“Certainly a privilege and an 
honor for our team to be … playing 
a great team like the University of 
Michigan with great tradition and 
a great coach in Jim Harbaugh,” 
Alabama coach Nick Saban said on 
a conference call Sunday evening. 
“And this is something that we — 
a challenge that we certainly look 
forward to.”
Harbaugh is 1-4 in bowl games 
during his time at Michigan, 
though the one he did win was also 
the last time the Wolverines were 
in the Citrus Bowl, where they 
beat Florida to conclude the 2015 
season.
All three teams Michigan lost to 
in the regular season made either 
the Playoff (Ohio State) or a New 
Year’s Six bowl (Wisconsin and 
Penn State), clearing the way for 
the Wolverines to get a spot in the 
Big Ten’s top non-New Year’s Six 
bowl.
Meanwhile, the powerhouse 
Crimson Tide seemed destined 
for a College Football Playoff 
spot — what would’ve been their 
sixth in six years of the Playoff — 
for most of the season, but when 
quarterback Tua Tagovailoa went 
down for the season with a hip 
injury and Alabama lost to rival 
Auburn, it fell out of a New Year’s 
Six spot altogether.
Still, the Crimson Tide are 
second in the country in SP+ and 
have the third-ranked offense and 
the No. 6 defense. Michigan is 19th 
and ninth, respectively.
“The Alabama team is a great 
team,” Harbaugh said. “I have the 
utmost respect for them. They’ve 
set the bar for college football over 
the last many years, the model of 
success and credit to Nick Saban 
and his coaches. High-powered 
offense, a great defense, and I’ve 

already started to look at them.
“… That offense, they average 
somewhere around 48 points 
a game and their two offensive 
tackles look to be guys that could 
be top-20 picks in the draft. A lot 
of good receivers. This could be the 
best group of receivers maybe ever. 
Three top picks, probably three 
first-round picks in that group and 
two really talented running backs. 
Very impressed with (quarterback) 
Mac Jones and the defense is, the 
other thing is, the special teams is 
dynamic. The punt returns, kick 
returns, those two especially. We’ll 
need to have a great plan in regards 
to all three phases of the game. 
Excited for the opportunity.”
The two teams last played in 
2012, when they met at a neutral 
site for the season opener. The 
Crimson Tide won in a blowout, 
41-14. Before that, their most 
recent matchup was in the 2000 
Orange Bowl — 20 years to the 
day before their upcoming Citrus 
Bowl tilt — where Tom Brady led 
the Wolverines to a 35-34 win in 
the first-ever overtime BCS Bowl 
game.
Though Michigan and Alabama 
rarely play each other, there is still 
some level of familiarity. Offensive 
coordinator Josh Gattis spent 
the 2018 season as the Crimson 
Tide’s co-offensive coordinator 
as they made a run to the national 
championship 
game. 
Shea 
Patterson also faced off against 
Alabama as Mississippi’s starting 
quarterback in 2017.
Saban 
and 
Harbaugh 
only 
really have a passing relationship, 
but as coaches of two blue blood 

programs, they respect each other 
and know the Citrus Bowl will 
bring a unique challenge.
“I have a lot of respect for 
Jim,” Saban said. “I think he’s 
been a great coach and done a 
great job at Michigan, did a great 
job every place he’s been prior to 
that. We have a lot of respect for 
the University of Michigan, their 
program, their tradition and the 
job that he’s done as a coach.”
Normally, the Citrus Bowl 
doesn’t feature marquee matchups 
by design. But when schools with 
two of the largest fanbases in the 
country fell there, the meeting 
seemed like a no-brainer for the 
bowl.
Most of the Wolverines have 
not announced whether they 
intend to play in the bowl, though 
linebacker Josh Uche and tight 
end Sean McKeon, both seniors, 
have indicated that they will play.
“We still got one more game 
to play for,” McKeon said after 
the loss to Ohio State. “One more 
game to win. Looking forward to 
preparing with the team one more 
time and trying to get that (win).”
With a match against one of 
the consistent best teams in the 
country, that task just got quite a 
bit harder.
“It’s 
a 
fabulous 
team,” 
Harbaugh said. “A very, very elite 
team and as I said, credit to Nick 
Saban and the coaching staff and 
our preparation will have to be 
at its highest level. Good to know 
who you’re gonna play and get 
started. It’s a big-time matchup. 
We’re very much looking forward 
to it.”

Dilk cuts down on turnovers in win

Oakland had just cut the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s lead to seven, in the 
midst of a 10-4 run, and Amy 
Dilk had the ball at the top of 
the key. The sophomore guard 
looked to do what she does so 
often: find sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon in the paint and let 
Hillmon go to work. 
But this time, Hillmon wasn’t 
open, and Dilk threw the ball 
over her head — Dilk’s second 
turnover of the game. On the 
ensuing possession, Grizzlies 
guard Alona Blackwell drained 
a corner 3-pointer, and the 
Wolverines found themselves 
leading by just four with two 
minutes remaining in the third 
quarter.
This wasn’t an uncommon 
occurrence 
for 
Dilk. 
She 
averages over 3.5 turnovers 
per game, and her greatest ball 
security issues have come when 
the stakes are highest. In the 
Nov. 23 loss to Notre Dame, Dilk 
had three costly fourth-quarter 
turnovers, leading to a blown 
five-point lead. 
While Dilk has let her play 
spiral after bad turnovers in the 
past, she showed improvement 
Sunday. She didn’t turn the 
ball over the rest of the game, 
and on each of the next three 
possessions made no attempt to 
be the hero as she had against 
the Fighting Irish. She made 
easy passes, took an open 
shot in the paint and made a 
great bounce pass to a cutting 
Hillmon for an easy layup. The 
Wolverines scored on all three 
possessions, extending the lead 
to 10 — a lead they wouldn’t give 
up, defeating Oakland, 79-64.
“Amy Dilk’s decision making 
has really really taken strides 
in 
the 
positive 
direction,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico. 
“She’s 
really 
conscientious and trying to 
stop hitting the home run 
pass initially and moving the 

ball more on the offensive 
end. 
(She’s) 
showing 
great 
discipline.”
Added Dilk: “Coach is doing a 
great job of if I make a mistake, 
just let it go — don’t dwell on it. 
There’s a lot of game left to be 
played.”
From 
a 
ball 
security 
standpoint, Sunday was Dilk’s 
best game since the loss to Notre 
Dame, when she played the 
entire game. While Barnes Arico 
didn’t think that fatigue played 
a role in Dilk’s lackluster fourth-
quarter play, she has made an 
effort to give 
Dilk 
a 
few 
minutes on the 
bench in every 
game since — 
especially when 
she makes a bad 
turnover.
This change 
is in large part to 
Barnes 
Arico’s 
newfound trust 
in 
sophomore 
guard Danielle Rauch, who 
has appeared in each of the 
last four games at point guard. 
While lacking some of Dilk’s 
scoring prowess, Rauch has 
shown the ability to be a capable 
floor general with Dilk off the 
floor and has impressed on 
the defensive end, grabbing 
four steals over the four-game 

stretch.
Rauch played an important 
role in a 12-2 Michigan run to 
end the first half, assisting on 
two of the Wolverines’ five field 
goals in that span.
Having the ability to put 
Rauch in for extended periods of 
time has helped Dilk calm down 
after making a bad decision and 
keeps her fresh for the end of the 
game.
“I think Danielle has proven 
in practice every single day 
she’s ready for the opportunity,” 
Barnes Arico said. “She limits 
her 
turnovers 
as well and her 
decision making 
has been really 
good for us.
“Just to give 
Amy 
a 
break 
every now and 
again to get her 
re-focused 
and 
locked in really 
helps 
Amy, 
as 
well.”
The change in Michigan’s 
use of Rauch has paid dividends 
for Dilk, allowing her to calm 
down when her play gets sloppy. 
Sunday showed just how much 
of a weapon Dilk can be when 
she takes care of the ball, and a 
spell on the bench after a poor 
decision has made this version 
of Dilk the new norm.
