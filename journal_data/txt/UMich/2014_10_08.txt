Government meeting Tuesday in the CSG Chambers.

resolution, after debat~e

Despite several
.amendments,
assembly decides
against proposal
By EMMA KERR
DailyStaff Reporter
Nearly a month after its ini-
tial introduction, Central Stu-
dent Government voted against
the adoption of a resolution that
would have formally affirmed

CSG's support of the people of
Ferguson, Mo. and their dem-
onstration efforts following the
death of Michael Brown.
The resolution received 22
dissenting votes and 11 affirma-
tive votes.
After being proposed Sept.
16 and postponed Sept. 23, the
assembly was given opportuni-
ties to propose amendments,
three of which were voted upon
and passed.
The resolution asked CSG to
stand in solidarity with the Fer-
guson community and against

"increased racist, unjustified
police brutality," while support-
ing any nonviolent actions of
youth against this alleged police
brutality.
In August, following the
shooting of an unarmed Black
teenager, Michael Brown, by
a white police officer, Darren
Wilson, a protest against police
brutality escalated as police
responded to the protest, accom-
panied by incidents of looting.
The events spurred national
discussion this past summer on
the topic of racial stereotyping

by law enforcement and over-
militarized police forces, many
voicing the opinion that use of
armored vehicles, automatic
weapons and body armor was
unnecessary for handling the
situation.
Past approvedamendments
included the removal of milita-
rization language, the phrase
"local cops are trained and
armed to treat local residents
like criminals," and the addi-
tion of language that would only
ask CSG to consider supporting

Governor has
maintained roots
in Ann Arbor area
since 1975
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder,
one of Michigan's most popular
conservative leaders, resides in
Ann Arbor, a city comprised of
mostly liberal-leaning citizens.
Though the 48th governor
spent his childhood in Battle
Creek, Mich., he moved to Ann
Arbor after being accepted to the
University. He currently lives in
the city with his wife Sue, with
whom he has three children.
Snyder entered the University
in 1975. By the time he turned 23,
the future governor had received
a bachelor's degree, business
degree and law degree, and
earned his license as a Certified
Public Accountant.
Snyder left Ann Arbor to work
as a tax accountant for Coopers

& Lybrand in Detroit, going on to
become one of the firm's youngest
partners after working for only six
years. He then moved to Chicago
to work at Gateway Computers for
six years and eventually became
the company's president. Snyder
moved backto Ann Arbor in1997to
form two Michigan-based venture
capital funds worth about $200
million in investment capital.
Along with living in the city,
Snyder served as the chair of Ann
Arbor SPARK, a nonprofit orga-
nization dedicated to economic
development in the greater Ann
Arbor region, and served as an
adjuwnct assistant professor of
accounting at the University from
1982 to 1984.
The governor keeps in close
contact with his alma mater,
holding talks at the University
and sponsoring an internship
program in his office that many
students participate in. Most
recently, he visited the Univer-
sity to speak at the inauguration
ceremony for University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel.

Daily Detroit Arts Columnist
When I walked into Dmytro
Szylak's backyard, I was greeted
by a towering structure com-

prised of wood, carousel horses,
windmills, rockets, helicopters
and ceiling fans. Everything has
been painted with bright col-
ors and connected together in
a ramshackle way that makes it
look like it could fall down at any
moment, which, Szylak assured
me, it will not.
It's been standing as is for
more than 20 years.
For a 90 year old, Szylak

moves quite fast, bustling about
his yard, pushing the tail end of
an airplane, sending it spinning
in a circle. His face is wrinkled,
his hat covered in paint and his
chin dotted with white whiskers.
I ask if we can chat about the
project, but before he'll tell me
anything, he gestures over at a
box with a hand-painted sign
that reads "FREEDONATION".

Across the nation,
response teams put
preemptive protocol
in place
NEW YORK (AP) - Public
hospitals in New York City are so
concerned about Ebola, they've
secretly been sendingactors with
mock symptoms into emergency
rooms to test how well the triage
staffs identify and isolate possible
cases.
A small Ohio hospitalhas hung
up signs imploring patients to let
nurses know immediately if they
have traveled recently to West
Africa.
And across the U.S., one of the
nation's largest ambulance com-
panies has put together step-by-
step instructions for wrapping
the interior of a rig with plastic
sheeting.
There hasn't been a single con-
firmed case of an Ebola infection
happening on U.S. soil; the case
confirmed in Dallas involves a
man who, like several health care
workers treated in the U.S., con-
tracted the virus in Liberia. But
health care providers are worried
enough to take a wide variety of
precautions.
It isn't yet clear whether these
preparations are overkill, or not
nearlyenough.
But health care experts say
that at the very least, the scare is
providing a chance to reinforce
and test infection control proce-
dures.
"The attention has been, in a
sad way, very helpful," said Dr.
Richard Wenzel, an epidemiolo-
gist at Virginia Commonwealth
University and a former president
of the International Society for
Infectious Diseases.
Even small hospitals far from
international travel, hubs should
be reviewing protocols and
screening questions, and poten-
tially buying protective equip-
ment such as face masks and
protective suits, he said. This will
help them avoid repeating the

mistakes of Dallas, where a Libe-
rian man with Ebola symptoms
was sent away despite telling
a hospital staffer he had trav-
eled from Africa, and potentially
infected many others before he
was readmitted two days later.
"The debacle in Texas should
stimulate improved awareness
and responses," Wenzel said.
A growing number of false
alarms are already giving hos-
pitals around the country ample
opportunities to test infection
control procedures.
In New York, 24 patients
screened for Ebola have been put
into isolation over the past eight
weeks in city-owned hospitals,
accordingto Dr. Ross Wilson, the
chief medical officer at the New
York City Health and Hospitals
Corporation. None had the dis-
ease (some had malaria and one
had typhoid), but Wilson said iso-
lating potential cases as quickly
as possible is essential to keep the
virus from spreading.
"We're taking this very seri-
ously," he said.
Emergency room staffers have
been confronted with actors to
test their triage measures, and
some have been retrained on how
to properly put on and remove
protective gear, Wilson said.
At the city's flagship. Bellevue
Hospital Center, technicians are
assembling a lab to exclusively
handle Ebola blood tests, keep-
ing samples from contaminat-
ing other equipment, and a small
number of beds are ready and
waiting in an isolation ward for
any confirmed cases.
New York City's 911 operators
have been told to ask people who
describe Ebola-like symptoms
and ask for ambulances if they've
traveled to West Africa recently.
That question is also becoming
thenormatAMR,whichoperates
private ambulances in 40 states.
It has told its staff of 19,000
paramedics and EMTs that if
patients with these symptoms
answer yes, they must alert other
health authorities and put on
extra protective gear, including
shoe coverings, a mask and gog-

gles.
"We don't want to respond
with apresumptionthateveryone
in the field has Ebola" said Dr.
Ed Racht, AMR's chief medical
officer. "The idea is, if the travel
question is positive with the
symptoms,itgivesusayellowflag
... It doesn't mean immediately
putting on the space suits."
That said, the company has
issued step-by-step instructions
for using plastic sheeting, gar-
bage bags and ducttapecto protect
the ambulance and driver from
patients with the virus. Step No.

the rig and affix to bench seat,

bowl affectinanefforttochannel
any body fluids toward the center
of the floor causing fluids to col-
lect inone area:'
A more commonplace pre-
caution is in place at the Mercer
County Community Hospital
in Coldwater, Ohio, a village of
4,400 people near the Indiana
state border. Nicole Pleiman, an
infection prevention and control
nurse, said the hospital posted
signs at entrances a month ago
telling patients to notify the staff
immediately if they've traveled
recently to African countries hit
by the outbreak.
"We will definitely revisit that
to see if we need to do anything
additional," she said.
And three major hospitals in
Dallas have established isolation
units and consulted with staff on
handling anyone else with Ebola.
With eight children sent home
from school because they had
direct contact with the lone con-
firmed Ebola victim, Children's
Memorial Hospital in northwest
Dallas is preparing for pediat-
ric Ebola patients, and doctors
at Parkland Memorial Hospital
and Baylor University 'Medical
Center have identified teams of
doctors and nurses to be ready.
As has' become commonplace
nationwide, the Dallas hospitals
are screening incoming patients
to see if they've traveled to West
Africa within the last three
weeks.

Invasive Asian

Kalamazoo River
Genetic material from
Asian carp has been found
in the Kalamazoo River in
southwestern Michigan, but
there's no indication the invasive
fish have become established in
the river that flows into Lake
Michigan, officials said Tuesday.
DNA from silver carp was
detected in one of 200 water
samples taken in July from the
river in Allegan County, this
one from below the Caulkins
Dam about 24 miles from Lake
Michigan, the state Department
of Natural Resources and the

said.

DNA for silver carp has been

"environmental DNA" refers to

waters, shedding scales, mucous
or excrement.
BOISE, Idaho
Appeals court rules
same-sex marriage
legal in Idaho
A federal appeals court
declared gay marriage legal in
Idaho and Nevada on Tuesday,
a day after the U.S. Supreme
Court effectively legalized
same-sex marriage in 30 other
states.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco struck
down the two states' bans on
gay marriage, ruling they vio-
lated equal protection rights.
"This is a super sweet vic-
tory," said Sue Latta, who along
with Traci Ehlers sued Idaho
last year to compel the state
to recognize their 2008 mar-
riage in California. Three other
couples also joined the lawsuit
to invalidate Idaho's same-sex
marriage ban.
"Taxes are easier, real estate
is easier, parenting is easier,
end-of-life planning is easier,"
Latta said.

Texas Ebola patient

The family of a man diag-

Ebola again visited him at the
hospital Tuesday but declined
to view him via video the last
time had been too upsetting.
Relatives of Thomas Eric
Duncan glimpsed him using a
video system at Dallas' Texas
Health Presbyterian Hospi-

tal on Monday. But when they
returned anew, this time with
Rev. Jessie Jackson, they decid-
ed such images were too much.
"What we saw was very pain-

Duncan's nephew, Josephus
Weeks.
Weeks said he and Duncan's
mother were unable to sleep
after seeing Duncan's face.

city.
The government and students
leaders announced they will
begin talks on political reform
on Friday. But while a govern-

the students expressed anger

SNYDER
From Page 1A
Michigan a truly special place
is not one area or sectors, it is
the humanity of the University,
the people," Snyder said in his
speech.
In the same month, Snyder
also toured the MHacks expo
to see projects created by inno-
vative students from all areas
of campus, including various
mobile apps, a robotic arm and.
software that analyzes the
mood in speeches.
The University's chapter of
College Republicans is one of
the largest organizations that
supports Snyder's actions in
the state and the University
and has been working for his
reelection this fall. LSA senior
Gabriel Leaf, chairman of the
University's chapter of College
Republicans, said he believes
the biggestcreason why students
believe in Snyder are because of
his job-creating policies.
A major platform of Snyder's
2010 campaign was creating
jobs and stimulating Michigan's
economy, earning him the title
of "one tough nerd." Since tak-
ing office in January 2011, the
state has created approximately
300,000 new private sector

jobs and the administration
has overseen the sixth-fastest
growing economy in the nation
- though there is significant
debate about how much Sny-
der's policies have contributed
to the economic growth.
Leaf said the hardest posi-
tion a student finds themselves
in after graduation is the task of
actually finding a job and enter-
ing the workforce, a problem he
believes Snyder understands
and wants to simplify.
"He understands where
they're coming from, he under-
stands their background," Leaf
said. "He's been what we've
been through."
Members of the College
Republicans and other stu-
dents have been helping galva-
nize voters to support Snyder
through the student group
Wolverines For Rick. Though
Leaf acknowledges the city's
liberal reputation, he fully

"It is hard trying to get a
Republican basis here in the

is some here."

KillTheCup.com. After uploading
the pictures, participants are eli-
gible to receivea prize.
After calculating the results,
KillTheCup.com uses prizes
and gift cards as incentives to
encourage student participation.
After the end of the campaign,
the teams who achieve the high-
est participation will be eligible
to receive a $5,000 grant to start
and fund their personal sustain-
ability project. Along with this
grand prize, four weekly prizes of
$50 and one iPad will be awarded
for each individual campus.
Drew Beal, co-founder of
SVS, said he- likes to view the
organization as a "social enter-
prise" because of the combina-
tion of social and environmental
impacts. Beal said he hopes stu-
dents, faculty and staff will gain
a general awareness of the impor-
tance of sustainability that can
result ina daily habit.

"They can learn that little
adjustments to daily routine col-
lectively, can have a huge impact
on the environment," Beal said.
Along with encouraging con-
sumers to reuse coffee cups as
a daily routine, Beal hopes that
the Kill the Cup campaign will
construct a new norm on college
campuses across the country.
"If we can really celebrate the
fact that more and more people
are getting coffee in a reusable
cup on a specific campus, then it
will help establish a social norm
within that university," Beal
said. ,
Beal and Mike Taylor, co-
founder of Kill the Cup, started
the program while in graduate
school at the University of Cali-
fornia, San Diego in 2013. They
piloted the program last year at
UCSD and decided to expand
their outreach after an estimat-
ed 1,300 disposable coffee cups
were saved, which translates to
approximately 80 pounds of land-
fill waste.
"Not only were people bringing
their own cup more frequently
and there was a lot of excitement
around sustainability, but the cof-

fee shops we worked with also
were more profitable," Beal said.
Beal and Taylor implemented
a four-week program at George-
town University in the fall of 2013
to compare and validate their
initial findings. Georgetown's
results were also positive, which
resulted in Taylor and Beal pursu-
ing this campaign into SVS.
Public Policy senior Kayla
Ulrich, co-director of Kill-A-Watt
at the University, said Beal con-
tacted her and LSA senior Natalie
Stevenson, co-director of Kill-A-
Watt, and explained the details of
the competition and the mission
of SVS. Ulrich said this competi-
tion would expand the current
sustainability movement at the
University and "bring something
new and fun to campus."
While there are many different
sustainability efforts on campus,
Ulrich said Kill the Cup is dif-
ferent than others because the
results are concrete since Kill the
Cup's focus is waste reduction.
"Because we are talking about
cups, I think that it is a lot more
relevant and more tangible. Peo-
ple will be ableto relate to it much
better," Ulrich said.

Assembly members dis-
cussed amendments to the res-
olution extensively and, though
each proposed amendment
passed, the resolution was still
voted down, with dissenting
voters noting the language as
being generally too extreme
and overreaching.
The resolution presented
to CSG was submitted at 4:54
p.m. Tuesday, two days after
the deadline to submit resolu-
tions and did not include pre-
vious amendments made and
passed by CSG in prior weeks.
Those amendments were added
and the updated resolution wdl
presented to CSG and voted on.
Among those voting yes for
this resolution, LSA senior
Michael Chrzan, School of
Education representative, said
though the resolution was
flawed, it was his belief that the
CSG body should still have sup-
ported the amended resolution.
"Obviously there were
ways that it could have been
improved," Chrzan said, "It did
not have to be a perfect resolu-
tion and I think that this reso-
lution fit the bill enough that it
could have been passed. There
were no extreme generaliza-
tions or inaccuracies and as a
person who has lived experi-
enced like these, I will say it is
disappointing."

Stephen Richards said, as the
representative of the School of
Social Work, he advocates for
social justice and believes in
this cause and the values set
forth in the resolution.
"It is fact that these things
do happen to people of color,"
Richards said. "I do under-
stand that this assembly is not
a majority of people of color
and do not have these personal
experiences, but all of us do
have experiences with these
sorts of things. It is hard to rec-
oncile the fact that these things
do happen in our communi-
ties."
Members from By Any
Means Necessary responsible
for recent protests on cam-
pus this month and earlier'
this year were in attendance.
BAMN Organizer David Doug-
lass asked CSG to colnsider the
opportunity their resolution
presented for minority stu-
dents on campus to be involved
in the Ferguson movement as
leaders for campuses across the
country.
"We are in a very impor-
tant historic window. We can
make history tonight and stand
against this racist murderer,"
Douglass said, referring to
Wilson. "Students come here
because they expect to be a part
of a diverse, integrated student
body, but they are met with
the reality of a segregated and
white student body."
Members who voted for the
resolution said they hope to
continue to address this issue
and develop and present a new
resolution in the future.

Kurdish troops work
to expel extremists
along Thrkish border
MURSITPINAR, Turkey
(AP) - Islamic State fighters
were poised to capture a stra-
tegic Syrian town on the Turk-
ish border, Turkey's president
warned Tuesday, even as Kurd-
ish forces battled to expel the
extremists from their footholds
on the outskirts.
The outgunned Kurdish fight-
ers struggling to defend Kobani
got a small boost from a series
of U.S.-led airstrikes against the
militants thatsenthuge columns
of black smoke into the sky. Lim-
ited coalition strikes have done
little to blunt the Islamic State
group's three-week offensive,
and its fighters have relentlessly
shelled the town in preparation
for a final assault.
Warning that the aerial cam-
paign alone was not enough to
halt the Islamic State group's
advance, Turkish President
Recep Tayyip Erdogan called
for greater cooperation with
the Syrian opposition, which
is fighting both the extremists
and forces loyal to Syrian Presi-
dent Bashar Assad.
"Kobani is about to fall,"
Erdogan told Syrian refugees
in the Turkish town of Gazian-
tep, near the border. "We asked
for three things: One, for a no-
fly zone to be created; Two,
for a secure zone parallel to
the region to be declared; and
for the moderate opposition in
Syria and Iraq to be trained and

equipped."
Erdogan's comments did not
signal a shift in Turkey's position:
He has said repeatedlythat Anka-
ra wants to see a more compre-
hensive strategy for Syria before
it commits to military involve-
ment in the U.S.-led coalition.
Turkish tanks and other
ground forces have been sta-
tioned along the border within a
few hundred yards of the fight-
ing in Kobani, also known as
Ayn Arab, but have not inter-
vened. And while Turkey said
just days ago that it wouldn't let
Kobani fall, there's no indica-
tion the government is prepared
to make a major move to save it.
Since mid-September, the
militant onslaught has forced
some 200,000 people to flee
Kobani and surrounding villag-
es, and activist say more than
400 people have been killed in
the fighting. It has also brought
the violence of Syria's civil war
to Turkey's doorstep.
Capturing Kobani would give
the Islamic State group, which
already rules a huge stretch
of territory spanning the Syr-
ia-Iraq border, a direct link
between its positions in the Syr-
ian province of Aleppo and its
stronghold of Raqqa, to the east.
It would also give the group full
control of a large stretch of the
Turkish-Syrian border.
Syrian Kurds scoffed at the
rhetoric coming out of Ankara.
They say that not only are the
Turks not helping, that they are
actively hindering the defense
of Kobani by preventing Kurd-
ish militiamen in Turkey from
crossing the border into the

town to help in the fight.
"We are besieged by Tur-
key, it is not something new,"
said Ismet Sheikh Hassan, the
Kurdish defense chief for the
Kobani region.
Relations between Turkey
and Syria's Kurds have long been
strained, in large part because
Ankara believes the Kurdish
Democratic Union, or PYD - the
leading Syrian Kurdish politi-
cal party - is affiliated with the
Kurdish PKK movement that has
waged a long and bloody insur-
gency in southeast Turkey.
In towns across Turkey,
Kurdish protesters clashed
with police Tuesday, while
Kurdish demonstrators forced
their way into the European
Parliament in Brussels - part
of Europe-wide demonstrations
demanding mor help for the
besieged Kurdish militiamen
struggling to defend Kobani.
Turkish news agencies say
least at 14 people have died and
scores were injured in clashes
between Turkish police and
Kurdish protesters.
Despite Erdogan's dire
assessment of the battle for
Kobani, the front lines were
largely stable despite heavy
clashes Tuesday.
Kurdish forces managed to
push back Islamic State mili-
tants from some neighbor-
hoods on the eastern edges of
town, hours after the extrem-
ists stormed into the areas,
according to the Britain-based
Syrian Observatory for Human
Rights. Still, two black jihadi
flags fluttered from a building
and a small hill on the eastern

An alternative application
The problem of student economic homogeneity needs to be targeted
Last month, Goucher College in Baltimore announced its
decision to implement an alternative application process,
where students may submit two pieces of work and a two-
minute video instead of a high school transcript..Goucher College
President Jose Bowen has said that this change was made in an
effort to broaden the applicant base - financially and creatively
- to the school. The success of students who elect these different
application paths is not currently known and will be traced as
they continue their college career. Several other liberal arts
colleges have presented similar options. Bard College in New York
has introduced an entrance exam consisting of academic essays
as a substitute to the traditional transcript. Dozens of colleges
like Wake Forest University and Smith College have application
processes that don't require SAT or ACT scores and allow optional
videos. Though these strategies are helpful in attracting a more
creative applicant base, it fails to address low socioeconomic
diversity in higher education.

ast Saturday, the enduring
walls of Michigan Stadium
reverberated with a new,
deafening chant:
"Fire Hoke! Fire
Brandon!" It was
a sad sight to see
and aneven sadder "
sound to hear. The
spirit of those
walls seemed
as absent as the
upper portions ELI
of the student CAHAN
section.
That spirit, too,
seemed absent in
the play of the team that day, and
it seemed absent in the subsequent
press conferences and releases put
out by Michigan coach Brady Hoke
and Athletic Director Dave Brandon.
The burning ember of our football
tradition has seen its passion extin-
guished, replaced by an insidious
sense of disgust and shame.
The hysteriaubiquitous during the
beginning of last week began with
an irresponsible call by an ESPN
TV announcer. When the replay
of sophomore quarterback Shane
Morris' stumble played, he, as is the
tendency of the media, immediately
resorted to hyperbole. This was an
announcer in no position medically,
nor organizationally, to make a claim
about the health of our quarterback,
nor the decisions of our staff. He was
completely and utterly unqualified in
this regard. He gave an uneducated,
superficial opinion and extrapolated
that out to a manifestation of a
struggling football program. He had
no right.
I resent the amount of coverage
news outlets have given this debacle.
It is without a doubt that we should
be winning more games in the

hose who sta
fourth year of Hoke's tenure. It is
without a doubt that Morris should
have been benched, in the context
of his obvious injuries. However we,
as malleable and restless students,
have perpetuated what were two
manageable, resolvable situations
into a festering sore on the face of a
previously proud block 'M.'
The calls and petitions for firings
are the impulsive, defensive reac-
tions of a cornered fan base. I, too,
felt this immediately following what
happened and I signed the petition. I
wholeheartedly regret it. These acts
have contributed more to the defac-
ing of our
university
than any-
thing else;
particularly However we,
whatever and restless sl
nonsense
came out of perpetuated
an announc- two manageal
er's mouth.
So, to situations int
those who sore on th
continue
to rally on previously prc
the Diag or
in front of
University
President Mark Schlissel's house,
on Facebook or on blogs: what do
you intend to achieve? Attention or
relief? This is not thesort of attention
that our school needs or deserves.
Headhunting will achieve little
more than rescinded commitments
from recruits and more flux and
uncertainty. None of the above
are long term solutions: they are
myopic forms of satiation for a
bloodthirstymob.
Bo Schembechler must have
anticipated these problems long ago
when he asserted that, "Those who

r'
t
b
tc
e
o

stay will be champions." Michigan
football then was most certainly not
in championship form. Neither is it
now. Itwould have been easy for play-
ers to quit under the new, authoritar-
ian regime Bo was putting in place. It
would have been easier to speak out
and bow out. He made his rallying
crying not in the best of times, but in
the most difficult. What happened?
Bo demanded commitment, his play-
ers remained committed and they
became champions.
We students must show the same
sense of commitment now as his play-
ers did then. Loyalty is consecrated
through
hardship and
challenge.
Naturally, it
as malleable is easier to
:udenst, have love Hoke
after win-
what were ning a Sugar
)le, resolvable Bowl than it
is after los-
O a festering ing a Little
e face of a . Brown ug.
But our job
)ud block 'M'. isn't to love
the team
when it's
easy. Our
dutyis to be there, through thick and
thin: to brave the August heat, the
Septemberstorms and the November
ice, to man our posts in sections 26 to
33, to cheer for a team that may not
be the best it has ever been, but isstill
ours. We, the students, ought to be
those who stay, no matter what.
I support Hoke and Brandon
because I support Michigan Football.
I think you should, too. Forever and
always, Go Blue.

These nonstandard ways to apply for college
benefit students who might learn and best
present themselves in nontraditional fashions.
The conventional college application simply
requires a high school transcript, one or more
personal essays and standardized test scores,
sometimes with a recommended interview.
Students that express themselves better
visually, or through additional samples of
academic writing, may be eager to opt for these
alternative processes. Colleges receive a wider
range of creative applicants, and potentially
diversify the student body with leaders in
different avenues. Itappears to be a greatoption
for economically disadvantaged students who
do not perform as highly in grades and test
scores due to a lack of additional educational
resources. Goucher'spresidentsuggeststhatthe
move will encourage students of lower-income
areas to apply to selective schools because they
can more easily represent themselves. They can
"show" their story instead of telling it through
current means that favor classically successful
and affluent applicants.
It is well known that disparities in financial
resources, and thus education, across
communities place extreme obstacles on
students of lower socioeconomic status as they
head toward college. While Goucher's new
policy is well-intentioned, this method does not
address the source of a major problem in the
college application process. Widening the range
ofmediathat students mayuse does not account
for the financial inequalities that pervade the
application process each step of the way. Just as
with normal applications, well-off students can
hire producers or other professionals to help

them create a higher quality video or academic
essay. Financially privileged students will
continue to have the upper hand in admissions,
regardless of the manner in which they are
allowed to express themselves. The measures
Goucher and other colleges have taken help to
even differences in learning and expression,
but do not extendbeyond that.
The University of Michigan currently
provides programs to recruit students of
lower socioeconomic status. The University's
Center for Education Outreach collaborates
with schools in Michigan to provide college
awareness and preparation for students in
kindergarten through12th grade. Its Michigan
College Advising Corps aims to increase the
number of underrepresented students in
higher education by hiring recent Michigan
graduates to work as college advisers in a few
high schools throughout the state. Michigan's
Detroit Center specificallyfocuses on coaching
students in schools of the Detroit metropolitan
area as well.
The University should consider expanding
and intensifying its efforts toward poorer
areas, and fully committo the goal of spreading
awareness for underprivileged students in
a broader context. Comprehensive outreach
that includes information about securing
financial aid, supplemental after-school
curriculums and positive attitudes toward
higher education increases success rates of
underprivileged students. If universities
truly intend on opening their doors to less
conventional students, they could start by
aiding those of lower socioeconomic status
years before applications even begin.

The real problem with Dave Brandon

'd like to believe that sports are
purely entertainment. That we
all watch purely to see athletes
run, jump and
throw faster,hard-
er and stronger
than the average
fan could dream ofs
doing. Obviously,
this isn't reality.
If you heard about
the rally lastweek-
end in Ann Arbor DEREK
calling to fire Uni- WOLFE
versity Athletic
Director Dave
Brandon, sports are anything but
just entertainment. The thousands of
hours I've invested in watching and
discussing sports would attest to that
as well.
There's no denying that sports
have the unique ability to rally com-
munities and, in many cases, repre-
sent the character of a city. This leads
to millionsofpeople regularlyrelying
on well-paid athletes or a bunch of
18- to 22-year-old kids to define their
moods. And despite having never
met these athletes, we genuinely care
about howthey perform. Win and it's
ecstasy. Lose and depression sets in.
That passion made this past
weekend especially tough for fans of
Michigan football, the Detroit Tigers
and Detroit Lions. They all lost. Butit
wasn't just that they lost; it was that
they all lost having failed to meet
high expectations.
Michigan lost again despite
having all the talent in the world. It
was supposed to be a great season.
The Lions lost because their
kicker missed three field goals. It was
supposed to be a big win.
The Tigers lost because their best
players didn't come through when it
counted most. There was supposed
to be a World Series celebration.
At one point, all of these teams had

somethingto play for - and the Lions
still do - but because of not meeting
these high expectations, Michigan
football and the Tigers' seasons can
only be looked at as failures. Goals
were not met, plain and simple.
Now of course, the teams''
performances don't have any tangible
effect on my life. Win or lose, I still
have an 8 a.m. class on Tuesdays.
Yet like most fans, I was and still am
upset. However, it was in the midst
of this downright disappointment
that I realized why sports
matter and where this emotional
dependence originates.
It's because ___
we all see or
want to see That pass
a little bit of his past
ourselves in
our favorite especially to
athletes - well, of Michiga
not the physical
skills, but the the Detroit'
storylines. Detroit
It's seeing
a player come
back from injury,
make a major impact on the team and
then making a connection such as,
"This is kind of like when I failed my
first chemistry test, then somehow
pulled off an A in the class."
It's the Detroit Pistons of the late
1980s and early 1990s where the
"Bad Boys" symbolized the tough,
underdognature bywhichthe people
of Detroit identified themselves.
That brings me back to-my point
on expectations. Seeing our favorite
teams lose and fail to meet expecta-
tions triggers a soft spot, because
we're all dealing with trying to meet
expectations in our ownways.
Sure, ours aren't coming from
millions of fans. They're coming
from friends, family and ourselves.
But that doesn't make them any less
significant. I despise-not meeting

my goals. I don't want to let anyone
down.
And I now realize that I project
those feelings onto my favorite
teams. After all, they're supposed
to be representing me. Therefore, I
expect the players to react the way
I would if I failed: I expect them to
care as much as I do.
"You feel like you let the fans
down. You feel like you let the
organization down. But there is
nothing we can do about it now,"
Brad Ausmus, the manager of Tigers,
said after Sunday's season-ending
loss to the Orioles.

Last year, 50 Michigan students and I,
under the leadership of the Student Union
of Michigan, marched through the Diag to
protest an Athletic Department that cared
more about its money than our safety. The
protest was in response to something I
would assume most people have heard about
by now. If you haven't, I will sum it up as
bluntly as I can: In 2009, Brendan Gibbons,
who eventually became our football team's
starting kicker, sexually assaulted a girl. In
the years following the event, the Athletic
Department has all but covered up the
incident. Gibbons went on to play for four
more years as our school's beloved kicker.
Sitting and studying on the fifth floor of
the Hatcher Grad library last week, I was
startled to hear 1,000 protesters, marchingto
do what we had intended to bring about less
than a year ago. This protest, though, wasn't
initiated to fire the Athletic Department
officials because of their rape-enabling cover-
up. Indeed, it didn't have anything to do with
justice at all. This protest was a reaction to
our team's losing streak, mixed with the
frustration about sophomore quarterback
Shane Morris' concussion and rising ticket
prices. If justice had been the reason for
last week's protest, it would have occurred
months, if not years ago.
Don't get me wrong - I love our football
team, and I too am upset by our losses and

dwindling student attendance at the games.
I stopped going to them this year because I,
as well as other members of the Big House
family, stopped feeling like fans and began
feeling like data. To Brandon, we have
all become the extension of his reign as
Domino's CEO. The fan base has morphed
into a fan market, the importance of student
support has been replaced by the importance
of student dollars and most importantly, our
safety has been compromised for our money.
Yet, what we all need to understand is
that these issues - the low attendance at
games, the exploitation of Shane Morris,
the rising prices - are all part of Brandon's
same dehumanizing scheme that became
immediately apparent when the Gibbons
cover-up was revealed. That is why instead
of marching against the Athletic Department
for losing games and raising ticket prices, we
should be marching for justice for the victim.
We should be marching to let our University
and Athletic Department know that we will
not accept the mere lip service they pay to
"our safety." Until this occurs, and until Dave
Brandon steps down for these reasons, we are
all complicit in the sexual assault of a fellow
student. And until we reassess what we are
marching for, we are all committed to making
this campus unsafe.
Jake Rothenberg is an LSA junior.

Indifference?
That's not me. Well, I guess you can't
expect everyone to think like you.
Regardless, I'm probably going to
keep lookingto athletes for direction.
Not because it's the best idea, but
because it's natural.
Sports find a way to simplify the
intricacies and complexities of life
and make nearly every scenario -
the last-second shot, winning after
being really down in the first half,
etc. - somehow applicable to a real
life scenario.
Itwouldn'tbeastretchto saythese
athletes embody the human condi-
tion: the good, the bad and the ugly.
And that's something an Introduc-
tory Psychology class can't teach.

I left my wallet in the car,
I tell him.
"I wait here," he says
matter of factly, in a heavy
Ukrainian accent. He crosses
his arms across his chest,
and leans against the multi-
colored garage. After return-
ing with $2 (which he made
sure to say was not enough to
buy a bag of chips) he agrees
to show me around.
Szylak came to the United
States back in 1950. He lived
in Gettysburg first. "You
know history of Gettysburg?"
he asks, cracking a smile to
reveal his one gold tooth.
He moved to Hamtramck
in the late '50s and worked
on the General Motors
assembly line for three
decades before retiring. Even
though he was no longer an
autoworker, he still felt the
need to work. So he began
erecting a massive, light-up
sculpture of painted objects
spanning across his entire
backyard, from one garage to
another.
"What you see," Sylvak
says, raising his paint-cov-
ered hands to the structure
looming above him, "my job.
I'm 90. Still I work every-
day."
The death of his wife
motivated him further to
keep adding on to Disney-
land, spending most of his
days inside the multicol-
ored garage in his backyard,

mediums have had as much
impact on the 20th century as
comic books, yet despite. their
influence on popular culture,
the actual success of comics

advent of digital comics and

The "Citizen Kane of
comics," "the Great American
Novel with superheroes;" if
there's a single comic book
you should ever read, it's
"Watchmen." Not so much
a comic book as a radical
experimentation in narrative,
"Watchmen" acts as a hybrid
in form, with panels broken
up between fictional passages,
documents and other works of
prose. It also joins "The Great
Gatsby" and "The Catcher in
The Rye" on the list of Time
Magazine's 100 Greatest
English Language Novels since
1923. It's a watershed, not just
for the graphic medium, but in
the delineation between high
and low culture in general.
The greatest comic book of
all time? This book might
very well be one of the most
important stories of the last
century. Read it.

Dark Knight Returns" by Frank
Miller; "Kingdom Come" by

2. "The Sandman"
by Neil Gaiman
A personal favorite. Neil
Gaiman creates a Homeric
poem and one of the greatest
fantasy stories ever written.
The story of Morpheus, the
personified manifestation of
dream, takes place in worlds
both real and imagined. In
the first volume, "Preludes
and Nocturnes," a crazed
magician imprisons
Morpheus for the majority
of the 20th century. When
he escapes, Morpheus finds
a world that has moved
on without him. With his
kingdom in shambles, the
Dream King must adapt to
a changed world and the
people he's ignored for
a millennium. Gaiman's
"Sandman" represents far
more than just a fantasy
story. It's a powerful,
often moving tragedy of
redemption, identity and the
power of storytelling. It also
acts as a poignant depiction
of the marginalized, with
an eclectic, diverse cast of
characters. A remarkable
creation of invention and wit.

4. "We3"
by Grant Morrison
One of the most emotional
experiences you will have
in a long time, "We3" is
a perfect starting point
for comic book newbies.
It's premise: "Homeward
Bound," if the animals were
experimented on and forced
to wear giant mechanized
robot-suits. "We3" is more
than an action tale, however;
it's a minimalistic, often
poetic exploration of the
arbitrary line between man
and animal, in our shared
capacity for good and our
disturbing potential for
savagery.

5. "Transmetropolitan"
by Warren Ellis
WhatifHunterS.Thompson
lived in a dystopian future?
Warren Ellis's cyberpunk
satire follows the exploits of
gonzo journalist of tomorrow
Spider Jerusalem, a mix
between Bugs Bunny, Hunter
S. Thompson and the Joker.
In "Transmetropolitan,"
Ellis invents a new type of
journalism, one where the
line between science-fiction
and reality shrinks every day.

Non-Comic Honorable
Mention: "The Amazing
Adventures of Kavalier and

This Pulitzer Prize winner
for fiction possesses just
as much visual splendor as
any comic. It's also a great
introduction for any literary
types looking to lower their
brow a centimeter or two
and turn to the funny books.
Chabon's magnum opus also
happens to be one of the
greatest novels written by a
living writer. The epic tale of
Josef Kavalier, Sammy Clay
and their fictional superhero
The Escapist takes its reader
on a beautiful odyssey into
the heart of the American
dream and the power of
storytelling, uniting high and
low culture. A masterpiece of
fiction.

He isn't focusing on the aesthet-

presenting his audience, through
music, with a personal experience
that relates to a larger, more criti-

My cinematic Judaism

ByZAKWITUS
DailyArts Writer
When I was younger, I never
thoughtthatmyJewishnesswould
survive the hellfire of adolescence
and puberty. My parents forced
Judaism upon me. They made me
attend worship services at syna-
gogue, take Hebrew school class-
es, have a bar mitzvah and all the
rest. I hated almost all of it, except
for the bar mitzvah loot, of course.
So, when hair sprouted from my
scrotum and the teenage rebellion
commenced, I tried very hard to
sever ties with Judaism: I refused
to attend services, declared my
atheism and chose not to partici-
pate in many Jewish traditions.
But the rebellion failed. See, my*
rebellion against Judaism focused
almost entirely on religious Juda-
ism; Ifailed to account for Judaism
as a culture, particularly Jewish
cinema. To simplify the story, my
mom was the one trying to raise
me Jewish religiously, whereas my
dad was the one trying to raise me
Jewish cinematically. Of course,
Dad didn't think about it like that,
and consequently neither did I,
which was probably why his way
was more effective; becoming
Jewish through film was cooler,
less "in-your-face" and overall
more enjoyable.
By age seven, Dad had my
younger brother Noah and I
watching Woody Allen's early
comedies - films like "Take the
Money and Run," "Sleeper" and
"Love and Death." There was no
way 7-year-old me understood
the gist of what was happening
in those films - plot-wise and
meaning-wise - but nonetheless
they shaped my development. For
example, in middle school, when I
was neither the most athletic nor

'Transparent' a study
in indentity, discovery,

Jeffrey Tambor stars
inAmazon Prime
trans-gender drama
By CATHERINE SULPIZIO
DailyArts Writer
In recent years, character
likeability is a debate that's
taken on heated and ethical
arguments
from both
sides.
Vulture
magazine Transparent
declared Amazon Prime
this the Streaming
age of the
streaming
TV auteur, and to ask for
likeable protagonists seems
akin to asking for laugh tracks
back or no nudity. It signals
you're unsophisticated,
maybe prudish. It's easy
to justify Walter White
because he's so far removed
from an everyday selfish
person. But in Jill Soloway's
"Transparent," the lens is a
little closer to home - which
makes the characters equal
parts heartbreaking and
redeemable, by the skin of
their deft characterization
and acting.
With light-washed
cinematography that casts
the show under its signature
elegiac gaze, we're introduced
to the Pfeffermans, a secular
Los Angeles Jewish family.
At its center is Mort/Maura
(Jeffrey Tambor, "Arrested
Development"), a retired
professor who reveals her
identity as a trans woman in
the stages of single, senior
life. The first episodes of
"Transparent" are tasked with
Maura's (ne Mort's) attempts
to breach the gap between her
identity and the world, which
most substantially consists of
her three children. The gap
between self and world is a
recurring theme that connects
the Pfeffermans: all are
struggling to fit their inward
identities into a jagged,
sometimes uncomprehending
outside. But as wise Maura
notes, part of that is because
they lack the ability to see
beyond themselves.
Together, the Pfeffermans
have rich and warm chemistry.
In a pilot scene that evokes
"Annie Hall" 's Easter dinner,
the camera restlessly circles
around the dining table with
Pfefferman chatter trickling
(actually, flooding might be a
more accurate word) in from
all edges. Soloway, especially
in the family scenes, has a
knack for taking the pulse of
Jewish identity and writing it
in with all its idiosyncrasy. It
also makes for some perfect
comic beats: "We come from
Shtetl people, your Grandma
Rose actually ate lettuce with
her bare hands," Maura says,
a gory slash of barbeque sauce
on her cheek.
For all their loving
familiarity, "Transparent"
's cast is equally self-
centered, though the show

neither moralizes nor

sentimentalizes. Rather,
it watches the characters
under a nonjudgmental gaze,
not unlike Maura's. Her
children are difficult and
good by different notes, and
we come to understand them
through a distinctly parental
survey. There is Sarah (Amy
Lendecker, "A Serious Man"),
a suburban mother whose
self-assured fagade belies a
fundamental uncertainty of
her life; she's married to a
Len (Rob Huebel, "Human
Giant"), whose name explains
everything there is to know
about him. When old college
flame, Tammy (Melora
Hardin, "The Office"),
re-enters ina haze of pantsuit-
rocking, aviator-wearing.
cool with a career as an
interior decorator ("designer,
actually," Tammy interjects),
we practically see a lightbulb
go off above Sarah's head.
Sarah's attraction to Tammy
represents a complex sexual
identity, but also yearning for
Tammy's iron-grip seize on
life. Ina telling scene with
Len,' Sarah asks if Tammy
and her kids can come over
for a play-date. Len responds
with the verbal equivalent of a
shrug at her sexual identity: "I
love lesbians." We learn Sarah
has a habit of harnessingthese
passive discontents until
they tumble into big, abrupt
changes. Almost immediately
as her affair begins with
Tammy, Len is swept out
of the picture. These rapid
narrative beats mirror Sarah's
own sudden decision-making:
she picks up one life and
plunks it into another.
Part of "Transparent"
's strength in capturing
queer identity is that it isn't
attempting to suggest the
universal; it's concerned
with particular character
studies. Sarah and Tammy
in no way' represent the
entire gay community, just as
Maura isn't a spokesperson
for the trans one. Because
of this, "Transparent" gives
the characters room to
breathe outside of impossible
obligations to perfectly define
an entire group.
"Transparent" also takes
the modernviewthatsexuality
is tangled amid gender and
sex, but that doesn't mean
it's all a homogenous knot.
Take the terminally drifting
Ali, played by lovely Gaby
Hoffman ("Girls"), who can't
seem to get unstuck from her
own patterns. Both Hoffman
and Carrie Brownstein
("Portandia"), who plays
her best friend Syd, gained
their acting chops from
playing quirky character
roles, and in "Transparent,"
they flesh those characters
out with adjoining crevices
and shadows. Hoffman
plays Ali with a precocious
intelligence, even as a thirty-
something year-old. In every
scene she's in, Ali imparts
a melancholic quality that
will feel achingly familiar to
every viewer who's dealt with
depression. She is also the

most 'queer' of the Pfefferman

children, in how she moves
between identities freely and
uninhibitedly. Throughout
Ali's various relationships,
'the edge of her undirected
intelligence damages most
often. In one scene, she
swiftly dismantles a sexual
relationship with two male
friends by suggesting they're
gay. She's high, thJ'r high,
it might be true, but we get
the sense that Ali isn't new
to these situations. Her self-
destructiveness is a growth
of her intellect and talent -
her potential nervously hangs
over Ali's constant wheel-
spinning.
What Ali lacks in self-
awareness, Josh, the sole
brother played by indie
darling Jay Duplass ("The
Mindy Project"), renders with
hyper image-consciousness.
He's the successful kid with a
high-paying job iri n'ii, the
hot band girlfriend (in a band
named Glitterish, go figure)
and tltehouse to go with it.
But healso has the childhood
babysitter with whom he
has a disturbing sexual
relationship that's bred a host
of problems. However, by epd
of season Josh has moved the
most of the children, even
miraculously self-actualized
a little.
Josh's storyline also
serves as one of the many
entrances into the origins
of the Pfefferman family
dysfunction. Through
flashback, we learn Shelly
(Judith Light, "Law and
Order: SVU") and Mort were
too entrenched in marital
problems to be the parents
the Pfeffermans needed. In
present day, Maura's quiet
grace radiates on screen,
and how she tolerates her
children is almost saint-like.
The mostly judicial use of
flashback fills in how her
composure was formed. In a
way, the flashbacks cast the
young parents of the same
type as their present-day
children: richly hewed but
oh-so-troubled.
Tambor brings masterful
sophistication to his
portrayal. of Maura. Seeing
her integrate who she always
was into the rest of her life is
educating, never preachy, her
navigation of a world which
prefers to neatly- bifurcate
people, like using the lady's
restroom or bumping into
an old colleague, executed
exquisitely. We never worry
about Maura, and in every
episode we see her come
more into herself. The show
is centered around Maura,
but she acts as a springboard
for the rest of the Pfefferman
family where the real turmoil
lies. "Transparent" takes the
asymmetrical form of many
shows today with its loose
plotting and natural dialogue.
Its quietness doesn't hinder
its power, and watching
the show in its entirety, it's
hard not to feel emotionally
overwhelmed at times. Pace
yourself=ith "Transparent"
and marvel over its detail -

this show stands up to it.

"You looooove mother Russia, don't you?!"

the most confident and was strug-
gling to figure out how to talk to
girls, I fell back on what I learned
from Woody Allen films - how
wit, humor and intellect could be
used flirtatiously. And when those
tactics failed, the leftover wit and
humor could be used as coping
mechanisms. Humor, I would
argue, is the Jewish people's quint-
essential coping mechanism: With
six million of our people dead,hav-
ingagoodsenseofhumorbecomes
all but necessary for maintaining
sanity. With Hollywood on the
rise, Jewish humor finds an outlet
that's popular and profitable.
In "The Gay Science,"Frederick
Nietzsche famously declared that
God is dead, but that His shad-
ow would continue to flicker on
our cave walls for a while before
finally vanishing. Traditional
forms of religion are dead too, and
Judaism is no exception. Yet the
shadow of religion continues to
flicker on our cave walls. For me,
this flickering is the flickering of
images from the movie projector.
I am not a religious Jew, but Iam,
whether I like it or not, a cultural

Jew. For me, God is dead and so is
religion, but in order to cope with
life, I still need the culture built
around the religion; and so in a
sense I still need religion. While
I still can, I want to bask in the
flicking shadows.
Two things I learned from
this introspection: Covertness
is key to ideological indoctrina-
tion and enjoyment is essential
to ideology. If I had noticed how
enjoying Woody Allen movies
was reinforcing my Jewishness,
my teenage rebellion may have
also included abstaining from
his films. But the fact of the mat-
ter is that I still enjoy "Take the
Money and Run," "Sleeper" and
"Love and Death," and no amount
of critique or analysis will change
that. Likewise, the Jewishness
that Woody Allen, Mel Brooks,
Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David
instilled in me, and continue to
instill in me, will probably never
go away. When I was younger, I
never thought that my Jewish-
ness would survive the hellfire

ARE YOU A DEGENERATE OR DRUNK?
JOIN DAILY SPORTS.

We'll make you worse!

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Skating through the
handshake line after Monday's
game, Zach Werenski could
finally take a deep breath. One
by one, he embraced his best
friends, his former teammates,
and when he got to the end of
the line, both U.S. National
Team Development Program
coaches slapped the freshman
defenseman on the backside.
He didn't feel: relieved
because Michigan defeated the
U.S. NTDP, a team that's come
into Ann Arbor and.won two
consecutive years, but rather he
didn't have to play against his
best friends any longer.
These were his teammates
just two months ago. Werenski,
a 17 year old, skated in the
NTDP last year, and was slated
to play with the same team that
faced off against the Wolverines
Monday night had he not taken
the opportunity to graduate
high school early.
"At first, I didn't think it was
going to be so bad going out
there and playing against my
friends," Werenski said Monday.
"Once I got out there I was
pretty nervous. I'm close with
all of them so it's kind of hard.
At first, you couldn't really treat
it like a regular game. I kind of
had to tell myself to get out there
and play."
Werenski added that he
felt more nervous on Monday
than he did on Saturday when

Michigan opened its season on
the road against Ferris State,
Werenski's first collegiate game.
Freshman forward Dylan
Larkin, another alumnus of
the NTDP program, said he
"couldn't imagine" playing

told him it was difficult to play

case and Werenski was reluctant
to be an aggressor, it certainly
didn't show.

added a formidable line to one
of Michigan's most uncertain
positions.
Against Ferris State, down
4-1 in third period, Werenski
made a strong effort to keep
the puck in the offensive zone,
passed to junior forward Justin
Selman, who dished a pass to
senior forward Travis Lynch
who buried it home. Michigan
coach Red Berenson lauded the
play after the game, saying the
freshman certainly rose to the
occasion in a raucous arena.
Despite being the youngest

player on the ice, Werenksi's
success doesn't surprise NTDP
coach Don Granato - Werenski's
coach last season - one bit.
"He's (a) heck of a player,"
Granato said. "His skills are
incredible; it's almost like he sees
the game in slow motion. He can
stay calm when other guys are

"He'll go 100 miles per hour

that it was strange facing off

and that he would talk to him
later in the night.
"(Werenski's) a tough player
to play against," Warren said.
"He's a really good defenseman,
going into college a year early.
We're good buddies and he's not
going to give you anything easy."
Werenski proved that to
be true Monday night. It just
took him a moment to realize
he wasn't donning the same
uniform as Warren.

PHOTOSTAFF PERSONAL STATEMENTS
As photographers, we express ourselves through our lenses instead of
our words. We remember moments of our lives though the frames of our
cameras. You can't place a word count on the sentiment of a photograph of
a loved one or special place. This week, Photostaff presents a collection of
moments that tell their personal stories.

Growing up surrounded by adults whose lives were defined by manual labor, I have gained
a immense admiration and respect for workers who make things with their hands.

The unusually stressful events that have punctuated the end of this summer in Ann Arbor have made simple
moments in beautiful places with gracious friends even more valuable to me.

I took this in North Bend, WA, which I consider to be my favorite place on earth. This photo
means so much to me because it sums up what I love most about North Bend and, to some
extent, what I love most about life: family, dogs, and an abundance of trees.

This is my grandmother, Charlotte Charter, at the family brunch where we celebrated her 90th The emotions I have when I look at this picture are indescribable. There is a dimension about this photograph that

out keep you from coming
up to bat."- Babe Ruth.
My heart dropped when Kevin
turned to me in the office and said,
"Oh you played baseball in high
school? That's perfect! You've got
to come play."
Kevin was one of the staff writ-
ers at the Chicago Reader, Chica-
go's alternative weekly newspaper'
and the publication I interned at
this summer. Kevin was also the
captain of the staff softball team,
part of a citywide softball "media
league."
I tried my best to look excited,
forced a smile and said, "Sure,
sounds fun!" but inside I was pet-
rified. My stomach ached with
nerves; my mind raced with worry;
I couldn't shake the feeling that
getting back out on a baseball field
would go horribly wrong.
It's true, I did play baseball
up through high school, starting
from the age of six playing T-ball.
As a young boy I fell in love with
the game - partly because it's the
best game in the world, and partly
because I was good at it. Baseball
took up the majority of my iden-
tity asa kid. For a short time, I was
somewhat of a local legend in my
little Chicago Park District house
league. Kids on other teams knew
who I was and would make sure
their teammates prepared them-
selves for when "that tall kid"
would be pitching. I was a star.
All of that changed when I final-
ly played at the high school level.
Because most of the other kids
were really good players, I wasn't
a hot shot anymore. Most of my
teammates and opponents played
on far more competitive travel
leagues. The coaches were critical
and if I wanted to keep playing I
would have to impress them. I was
humbled quickly and felt like I had
to constantly prove myself; I had
to earn the right to play the game
I loved.
Baseball wasn't just for fun any-
more; there was constant pressure
to prove myself. I didn't want to
lose that star quality from my mid-
dle schoolyears, but now I ended
up paying more attention to my
performance than the experience
of the game. I quickly assumed a
mentality of self-doubt, a tactic

that aimed to keep me constantly
working harder. I was careful not
to boast, brag or be over-confident
for fear that I might jinx myself.
This tactic might have been effec-
tive for a reasonable person, but
in my already worrisome brain, it
manifested as constant nerves and
frequent anxiety.
When Kevin invited me to play
over the summer, I figured it would
be a good chance for me to at least
get to know the writers - maybe
even staff at other papers - but
I still felt nervous. The pressure
now came from the high expecta-
tions from the staff: "He's good, he
played in high school."
I drove out to Seward Park, just
north of downtown Chicago, on a
Monday night, trying to calm my
nerves but finding it hard to get
out of my own head the same way I
had in high school. What if I stink?
Won't that make them think I'm a
loser? I'm supposed to know how
to write, too ... what if this shows
them I was never good at anything?
I arrived at the park and found
my co-workers, in the dugoutoppo-
site our opponent: CHIRP Radio.
My palms were sweaty, I was forc-
ing myselfto smile and make jokes.
Through all this anxiety I was also
supposed to show I could relax and

Despite my persistent -nerves,
some of the old feelings from my

back to me: the feel of the evening
breeze, the smell of the all-dirt
field and the sight of the Chicago
Skyline stood impressively just a
few miles away.
One of the senior writers
came over to me.

Wednesday, October 8,2014 Thestatement 3B

ou're lucky I'm not an asshole," my
father said to me on my 21st birth-
day. "I could have easily black-
mailed you by takingsome photos."
Birthdays have always been a strange
occasion for me. I wouldn't say I've ever had
a "bad" one, but it's difficult to say that I did
anything remarkable or memorable.
As I neared my 21st birthday in August,
the feeling of actually becoming an adult took
over. And it was scary.
Having a summer birthday usually seemed
to take away the stress that came with becom-
ing older and gaining more responsibilities.
- always appreciated my birthdate - Aug. 18
- because it acted as a good divider between
the other major events in the year. It was also
a cushion before the new school year began.
The only time I can remember getting emo-
tional on my birthday was when my family
visited my auntcand uncle in the Bay Area dur-
ing the early 2000s.
After enjoying an ice cream cake shaped
like a watermelon, I went to bed that night
deep in thought. Maybe it was because I had
too much dairy or because I really felt upset,
but I went to the bathroom to let it pass.
As I sat there hoping the feeling would
subside, I suddenly began to cry. Thoughts of
death, getting older and becoming an adult
crept in my mind. Perhaps it was triggered by
the adolescent thrill of eating a fruit-shaped
cake that madetears flow. All I know was that
I had stayed in the bathroom for a good 20
minutes, sobbing.
Maybe it had to do with me being the baby
of the family. I would never complain that my
parents looked out for me more than my other
siblings and tried extra hard to imprint what
was wrong and right in my head. Being the
third child, I guess it all came with the terri-
tory.
Still, as Igot older and more birthdays came
and went, the momentous day was marked
with pretty reserved celebrations: going to
the Mets game, seeing David Beckham play
in person, going out for sushi, having my first
beer (at least according to my parents' knowl-

opposed to theidea, it didn't exactly make me
giddy to hang out with aging hipsters at a place
that literally could only exist in Brooklyn.
As Aug. 1 neared and my time at home and
summer job crept closer to the end, I was
reminded that I had been summoned for
grand jury duty in Downtown Brooklyn.
I didn't think much of it at the time. I was
a student soon returning to Michigan for the
fall semester, so why would Iever get picked?
The only concerning thought that came across
my mind was that I had to wake up before 9
a.m. to get to the building.
With my paperwork and phone in hand, I
slouched down in a seat at the Kings County
Court building, waiting for the moment when
I finally gotto leave and get along withthe rest
of the month.
As the man in charge asked all students to
come up, I assumed I would verify that there
would be no way I could stay in Brooklyn long
enough for duty, and accordingly, get on with
my day.
"Are you in classes right now?" he asked.
"Well, no, but I'm leaving for Michigan on
the 20th," I replied.
"Great, this goes, from the fourth to the
15th," he quipped back.
As I sat back down confused as to what just
happened, I began to realize that, shit, I might
just get selected for grand jury duty.
As each name was called, my hopes began
to rise again that I would not be called. Then
it happened.
"Daniel Feldman. Please raise your hand if
you're in the room. Daniel Feldman."
Slowly, my hand rose.
I wanted to be angry, but what good would
that do? I was later told to report back to the
building on Monday for orientation.
After never truly experiencing a stress-
ful August day in my life, I suddenly had two
weeks full of stress because my weekdays
would be spend in court, following by week-
ends of working at my summer job in a local
restaurant.
With that, my early entry into adulthood
had begun. Each weekday for two weeks

I woke up at 7:30 a.m., prepped my lunch,
packed some reading material and workout
clothes, then headed to Jay Street to decide
whether people should be indicted for a crime.
I won't lie, it wasn't the worst thing in the
world; albeit the courtroom was as cold as an
igloo and the vending machines only carried
Classic Lays.
All things considered, it wasn't a bad way to
make an extra $400 for sitting down in a chair
and tryingnot to fall asleep.
As harmless as it turned out to be, my par-
ents still felt guilty that I had to serve jury
duty. Even though I was basically being paid
to just sit there, my father said he'd give me
$100 if I had to sit all 1odays.
I don't think he understood at that moment
how grand jury duty worked but I wasn't
going to argue with two crisp $50 bills.
As my last day of jury duty came to a close, I
felt older for some reason.
Maybe it was because of the tragic nature of
some cases I saw. Maybe it was because I was
among the youngest on the jury, which made
me realize I wouldn't have to do this again for
a while. Maybe it was the concept of waking
up early, commuting to "work" and riding the
train home with the "work crowd."
Or, you know, maybe it was all just leading
up to the relief I felt because I was finally free
from responsibility. I could act young again,
like a soon-to-be 21-year-old.
With my last of work at the restaurant Sun-
day, I made plans to go out with my co-work-
ers to celebrate my last shift and my birthday
come midnight.
After getting cut around 10 p.m., I rushed
home to take a shower and freshen up before
hittingthe town. As I tied my shoes, my moth-
er walked in half asleep to wish me an early
happy birthday. She also gave me the usual
"don't do anythingstupid, be safe" speech.
While I took the message to heart, I really
had no idea what was going to happen in the
next five hours.
After a brief refuge back at the restaurant,
we walked to a bar down Flatbush Avenue.
With a SixPoint IPA in my possession and my
friends gathered around me, we waited forthe
clock to reach midnight, signaling the begin-

ning of the next stage in my adult life.
As the clock struck double 12s, I imme-
diately yelled out, "Shots!" The next thing I
knew a shot glass of whiskey was in my hands
with a beer in the other acting as a chaser.
I knew this could mark the beginning of a
path toward blacking out, but I couldn't care
less. After a month of acting like an adult in
some capacity, I was finally ready to act my
age and, well, do somethingI might regret, but
surely remember.
And so the parade of drinks began, with my
coworker Juan floating out the crazy idea of
hitching a cab to a strip club in Queens at some
point during the point of no return.
What did I have to lose?
From the combination of kind of knowing
I was at a strip bar and being very drunk, I
was very scared, despite my new legal ID, to
confront the bouncer at the door. But after my
friend Drea yelled for all to hear that it was my
21st birthday, the bouncer immediately let us
in. "Have fun," I remember him whispering.
So I sat at the bar in front of the stage,
drinking a beer and watching the show. I
would have enjoyed just sitting there taking
in the scene, but I was escorted into the side
room for, um, VIP service. I don't really know
how to explain a very drunk lap dance, nor do
I care to try.
Returning to the bar, I felt pleased but not
really sure if I experienced it all the right way.
Fortunately, my friends dragged back in there
again an hour later, before last call, to go for
round two. At the end of it, I wasn't sure how
to handle the payment.
When we finally left the club at 4 a.m. to
return to Brooklyn, I felt the most drunk I'd
ever been. Walking into the building's lobby,
I approached the doorman, who I'd had
many serious, deep conversations about life
throughout the summer.
Finally feeling like an adult, I could have
easily had a brief but serious conversation
with him. Instead, I have no idea what I said.
Just like when I was 16, I found myselfback
in the bathroom. But this time, it felt good to
grow up and embrace what would come next
in my life.
Oh yeah, I also passed out next to the toilet,

t was just a joke, really. If
I got to know some cool
people, maybe even go
on a few dates, that would be
a bonus, but it wasn't the goal.
That's what real life is for.'
I don't remember what day
or even what month my life on
Tinder began, but I remember
the first night vividly. Fol-
lowing a friend's tweet ques-
tioning the ethicality around
Tinder, I got one immediately.
It was an impulse decision. I didn't think
about the potential cons of getting the app
when it meant a chance to meet girls.
I learned more in my first night on Tinder
than I did in an average month of school. I
learned that, like it or not, Greek Life is an
exceptionally photogenic organization; I
learned that there are at least six different
ways to spell Courtney; I learned that judg-
ing people can be way more fun than it lt oks.
I learned that no matter how much stigma
surrounds Tinder, the bulk of my female
friends had crafted their own profiles, I also
learned that girls near me actually find me
attractive. Huh.
I also learned, quickly, that it's still a cold
world for shy, awkward boys. Even on an app
where mutual attraction, location and age
are clearly stated, conversations don't start
themselves. I learned that even if a girl is
interested in you, she is capable of stopping
and giving you a digital cold shoulder simply
because the extra y in "hey" or the sideways
winking face in your opening message was
too forward.
But the most important thing that I
learned over the course of that year was the
saddest one. No matter how stupid I found
Tinder to be, I simply couldn't stay away.
They say not to let school get in the way
of your education, so I wasn't going to let my
classes get in the way of me refining and mas-
tering my Tinder bio. Day by day, I'd scour
every decent photo of myself and look for
ones that sent the "right message." Was my
black-and-white photo of me in a cutoff flag
football uniform giving the cool and edgy
look I wanted? Or would the photo of me
coaching and smiling with one of my nine-
year old swimmers on my shoulders give off
the friendly-guy look that girls might crave?
I weeded through my photos while
using every marketing and communi-

cations lesson I knew to perfect the accom-
panying 240-character bio. I constantly
searched for the right mix of bragging about
my accomplishments and being laid back or
even 'cool,' giving enough information for my
readers to understand who they were dealing
with, but holding back just enough to pique
their interest and make them ask for more.
Not too long, not too short. Not too serious,
but not too goofy either. My professors - who
thought I was merely texting or on Facebook
- would've been so proud to see the critical
thinking that went into every word on Tin-
der.
Clearly having too much free time, I:
attempted to acquire as many matches and
carry as many conversations as possible.'
I joined Tinder in a state of confusion and
boredom, but now I was hooked.
The first few days were simple enough;;
swipe right now, ask questions later. For me,
the most desirable trait ina woman on Tinder
is mutual interest. That's it. If you don't run:
at my weirdness, neediness, or bad puns, it's
very likely I won't ever leave.
After attainingmanyrmatches but with few
strong connections to show for it, it became
clear that there were too many matches to
keep track of on Tinder. SoI developed some
rules.
Like an elite internship, the rules were
arbitrary, but something .had to be done.
Mirror selfies, fishing pictures, being Cana-'
dian, having large tattoos Or using emojis to'
describe your lifestyle would result in a left-'
ward flick of my all-powerful thumb. The
same could be said for girls who posted too
many "moments," or were named'Darlene.'
I realized now that the goofiness of Tinder
had faded, and there was an end-goal. Past
generations finally decided to settle down
after years of exhausting dating, I was ready
to settle down on Tinder after three weeks. If

take
Tinder
past the explo-
ration stage, I
needed to streamline my efforts.
This didn't mean looking for love or "the
one" per se, just more than the typical small
talk that ended somewhere between learning
what they studied and what they thought of
their hometown.
Checking out matches and making small
talk aren't necessarily premium forms of
entertainment, but they're safe and easy to
do. Little attachment meant little risk. Once
conversations got going though, my lifetime
spent avoiding talking to girls started to take
its toll. I was in trouble.
It seemed no matter howI played my cards,
I would've been better off folding. There were
the times I corrected girls' grammar, times
where I somehow thought insulting the Chi-
cago Blackhawks would increase my chances
of a date and the time I thought comparing a
girl to a teddy bear would be a sweet compli-
ment. Tinder was designed to make my love
life more efficient, not my stupidity.
I eventually found success on Tinder. The
biggest complaint about Tinder is the horni-
ness of male users. It took the app years to
develop a photo-sharing feature, and the
report button gets increasingly visible with
each successive update. These two trends are
not coincidental.
Which left me as a weirdo who sucks at
small talk but can keep it in his pants. Did I
stand a chance after all?
The rejections piled up, but so did my
determination. I had invested too much time
into this game to stop early. Like a gambler
glued to the slot machine, I resisted giving
up, assuring myself that my luck was bound
to turn around at the next swipe. This led
to mass messaging, copying and pasting the
same lines to dozens of matches and unsuc-
cessfully counting on the law of averages.
This all went on for longer than I care to

ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND
admit and would probably still be going on, if
I hadn't realized how shallow Tinder was in
the most devastating way possible.
After roughly 1500 matches and hundreds
of mostly meaningless conversations, I had
finally found someone I "clicked" with. So
much so, that I spent an entire Friday evening
in front of my phone, chatting with her about
everything.
Mercifully, she suggested after hours
of conversation that we go grab pizza
and talk in person. A DATE!
Ecstatic, I put on shoes and
real clothes with an enthusi-
asm that my 8:30 accounting class would've
killed for. I returned to my phone to see a
rather rare message.
"Wait hold up ... how tall are you?"
Without blinking, I responded by explain-
ing I was 5'11." I'm not wowing anyone with
my height, but to me there's no reason to lie or
fudge details. Could I have rounded up, even
an inch? Yes. Should I have? Apparently.
"Lol," she replied. Adding a quick "nvm
then" a couple minutes later.
After a moment of sheer confusion, I found
out that she was 5'8," and considered boys
under six-foot "just friends."
Sound weird? Unfair? Moronic? Unfath-
omably shallow? Welcome to Tinder.
Unsurprisingly, that pretty much did it for
Tinder and me. I know that isn't a normal
situation, but the fact that I actively engaged
in a culture where fortune favors the shallow
(and tall, I guess) finally sunk in. I was out.
Yes, there were the casual hook-ups Tinder
was designed for, but were they worth it? Not
once.
Sadly, that's what made me keep com-
ing back for as long as I did. I'd learn later
in a psychology class that the potential for
"success" kept me swiping, even when the
rewards were few and far between. Because
in Cupid's latest, cruelest and shallowest love
game yet, I couldn't stay away.
I still have Tinder buried in the apps on my
phone, but every time I push the red flame
icon, I take it with a grain of salt.
Gone are the days of carrying 14 con-
versations at once, of using Tinder all over
the country 'just in case,' of obsessing over
whether or not I should refer to my academic
pursuits as "Michigan Business" or simply
"Ross."
At long last, I have returned to the real
world, and that isn't a joke.
