Ann Arbor’s recreational 
marijuana 
businesses 
reported higher levels of 
sales since local retailers 
took 
advantage 
of 
the 
statewide 
legalization 
of 
marijuana. Skymint joined 
five other cannabis retailers 
in Ann Arbor licensed to sell 
recreational marijuana on 
Jan. 9. 
Skymint, which is owned 
by Green Peak Innovations, 
is 
the 
largest 
marijuana 
company in Michigan. The 
dispensary has been open 
since November, and is one 
of six locations throughout 
the 
state, 
including 
one 
in Flint, which opened on 
Thursday. 

Summer 
Ransom, 

Skymint’s 
president 
of 
retail, said gaining a license 
for recreational sale has 
transformed business at the 
Ann Arbor location. 
“It’s been night and day for 
how busy we are,” Ransom 
said. 
“It 
has 
increased 
business by five times — 
certain days even more than 
that — so it’s been pretty 
crazy.”

The University of Michigan’s 
Central Student Government will 
send five representatives to the 
Association of Big Ten Students 
winter 
conference 
at 
Indiana 
University in Bloomington, Ind., on 
Friday.
The 
Association 
of 
Big 
Ten Students brings together 
representatives from each of the Big 
Ten schools’ student governments 
to 
share 
information 
about 
student governance and represent 
students to administrations and 
governments. 
LSA junior Aidan Sova is 
the executive director of ABTS 
and said he is excited to bring 
20 pieces of legislation to the 
conference, up from CSG’s typical 
10 items. The legislation includes 
tackling student affordability and 
developing 
ABTS 
partnerships 
with student advocacy groups. The 
flagship piece of legislation urges 
all Big Ten universities to invest 
with a climate conscious lens. 
“Ben Gerstein wrote on behalf of 
Michigan a piece of legislation that 
would increase our commitment 
to sustainability in asking our 
respective 
administrations 
across the Big Ten to no longer 
invest in fossil fuels,” Sova said.

When 
remembering 
Sam 
Epstein, 
linguistics 
and 
cognitive 
science 
professor, 
who passed away on Nov. 
29, colleagues and students 
reflected on his brilliance. 
During his 22-year career 
at the University of Michigan, 
Epstein 
was 
the 
founding 
director 
of 
the 
Weinberg 
Institute for Cognitive Science 
in 2014 and worked closely 
alongside 
Noam 
Chomsky, 
famed intellectual and linguist. 
Colleagues say his work in 
linguistics 
and 
cognitive 
science 
propelled 
forward 
these 
departments 
at 
the 
University, and his teaching 
was recognized by a 2009 John 
D’Arms Award for Excellence 
in 
Graduate 
Mentoring 
and an Arthur F. Thurnau 
Professorship in 2013. 
Marlyse 
Baptista, 
Department 
of 
Linguistics 
and the Weinberg Institute 
faculty member, met Epstein 
during her time as a student 
at Harvard University nearly 
30 years ago, where he was an 
assistant professor. They kept 

in touch when Epstein came 
to the University, and when 
Baptista received a position, 
they were able to continue their 
close 
working 
relationship, 
which 
became 
a 
life-long 
friendship. 
His 
knack 
for 
complex thinking, she said, was 
one of a kind. 
“If you think of Sam Epstein, 
one of the first things that 
come to mind is his brilliance,” 
Baptista said. “The brilliance 
of his intellect. And whenever 
you had a conversation with 
him, both as a colleague and 
as a friend, you knew that you 
were going onto some type 
of academic journey, whose 
endpoint would always be so 
deeply satisfying, because he 
had that kind of mind. It was 
always very elegant in the way 
that he reasoned and argued for 
a specific point. I don’t know 
anybody who can match what 
he had to offer.” 
While Epstein’s excellence 
as an academic is undisputed, 
Baptista and other colleagues 
unanimously 
emphasized 
the personality, charm and 
empathy he brought to campus.

Colleagues, students reflect on legacy 
of Cognitive Science Institute founder

Sam Epstein
remembered: 
‘His door was 
always open’

The Michigan Daily has 
a tip line just for these 
kinds of stories – tipline@
michigandaily.com. This is 
a private tip line viewable 
by a small team of reporters 
committed to this work. The 
Michigan Daily is listening.
University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel’s 
announcement 
on 
Wednesday 
of 
numerous 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations against Provost 
Martin 
Philbert 
follows 
long-running criticism of 
how the University’s Office 
of Institutional Equity has 
handled such claims in the 
past, as reported on by The 
Daily. 

Philbert, 
who 
was 
Schlissel’s 
second-in-
command, was placed on 
paid administrative leave 
Tuesday after the University 
received multiple allegations 
of his misconduct on Jan. 16 
and 17. 
The Office of Institutional 
Equity investigates sexual 
misconduct claims, among 
other 
allegations. 
OIE 
reported directly to Philbert 
as of Sept. 2019. 
University 
spokesman 
Fitzgerald 
said, 
despite 
supervising OIE, Philbert 
had no direct involvement 
with the investigations. 
“On a day-to-day basis, he 
has no hands-on role with 
the office or investigations 
at all,” Fitzgerald said. 
He 
noted 
that 
any 
allegations 
made 
against 

Philbert “absolutely do not” 
taint 
OIE 
investigations 
conducted 
while 
they 
reported to the provost. 
Fitzgerald 
emphasized 
the provost did not play a 
role in OIE’s investigations, 
adding 
that 
the 
office 
conducts its investigations 
independently. 
“It would be a mistake to 
think the provost, or anyone, 
had power or influence over 
investigations,” 
Fitzgerald 
said. 
“The 
investigations 
are 
done 
by 
trained 
investigators in the Office 
for 
Institutional 
Equity 
and they’re signed off by 
the Title IX coordinator 
if it’s a sexual misconduct 
investigation.”
Philbert had been on leave 
for part of last semester for 
medical reasons, Fitzgerald 

confirmed. Amy Dittmar, 
acting provost at the time, is 
not resuming the role as that 
particular 
administrative 
leave has ended. 
Before May 2019, OIE 
reported to both the Office 
for 
Diversity, 
Equity 
& 
Inclusion 
and 
University 
Human 
Resources. 
Fitzgerald 
said 
the 
University 
administration 
changed who OIE reported 
to in order to make the 
process more efficient. 
“It (the move to have OIE 
report to the provost) was 
partially to indicate the 
importance of this office, 
but 
it 
reported 
to 
two 
different offices,” Fitzgerald 
said. 
“And 
sometimes 
a 
joint reporting relationship 

Just a few minutes before 
7 p.m. on Thursday, the front 
steps of the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art were 
dotted with students dressed 
in a collection of cultural attire 
and winter jackets. Despite 
the cold, more than a hundred 
students were all there for the 
same reason: Paani Culture 
Night. 
Paani 
is 
a 
non-profit 
organization 
comprised 
of 
student volunteers dedicated to 
creating sustainable, evidence-
based solutions to supply clean 

water 
and 
improve 
health 
disparities. The organization 
has built more than 200 wells 
and donated around $100,000 
towards 
alleviating 
the 
sanitation crisis in Pakistan.
To host the event, Paani 
partnered with 10 cultural 
student 
organizations 
across 
campus, 
including 
the 
Bangladeshi, 
Egyptian, 
Iraqi, 
Jordanian, 
Lebanese, 
Palestinian, Pakistani, Persian, 
Syrian and Yemeni student 
organizations. 
Last year, Paani launched 
their first culture night at 
Rackham 
Graduate 
School 
which drew more than 100 
attendees not just from the 

University but also from across 
metro Detroit, including from 
schools such as the University 
of 
Michigan-Dearborn, 
Michigan State University and 
Wayne State University.
LSA 
sophomore 
Sukaina 
Himmati said the organization 
hoped to make this year’s event 
even bigger. 
“It was very important for 
those who initially started it 
and for us now to uplift the 
community that we started 
from,” 
Himmati 
said. 
“We 
noticed that a lot of our 
friends were a part of cultural 
orgs, and all the countries 
that we represented, all of 
them suffered from serious 

sanitation issues that affected 
the lives of the people back 
home.”
Comedian Abdallah Jasim 
emceed the event, entertaining 
the crowd and helping to 
bring awareness to Paani’s 
sanitation 
efforts. 
Decked 
in colored lights and music, 
the UMMA was filled with 
people of all backgrounds and 
interests. From card games 
to 
papyrus 
making, 
each 
organization set up a booth 
where attendees could learn 
about traditions and activities 
most meaningful to their 
organization’s culture.


A group of about 30 faculty 
members, including the nine 
members of the tenure bylaw 
working group, gathered in 
the Pendleton Room of the 
Michigan Union Thursday to 
discuss proposed changes to 
the University of Michigan’s 
tenure policy. 
Due 
to 
recent 
sexual 
misconduct allegations against 
Provost Martin A. Philbert, 
many 
professors 
expressed 
a feeling of urgency about 
amending these bylaws.
The working group, which is 
comprised of faculty members 
from 
various 
departments 
across the three University 
campuses, 
was 
created 
in 
October 
2019. 
The 
group 
was formed after the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
professor David Daniels was 
accused of sexual assault in 
August 2018 and placed on paid 
leave. The University is still in 
the process of firing Daniels.
Sharon Glotzer, Chemical 
Engineering department chair, 
chairs 
the 
working 
group. 
Glotzer led the discussion, 
which focused on suggesting 
a new tenure removal policy in 
regards to items 5.09 and 5.10 
in the regents’ bylaws, which 
deal with standard procedure 
in cases of faculty dismissal as 
well as severance pay.
David 
Potter, 
Arthur 
F. 
Thurnau professor of Greek 
and 
Latin, 
delivered 
the 
opening 
remarks. 
Potter 
said the University created 
these tenure policies during 
the McCarthy era to protect 
professors’ 
academic 
and 
personal freedom.
In addition to calling for 
the changes to these outdated 
bylaws, 
professors 
and 
attendees said they hoped the 
recommendations 
would 
be 

made quickly. 
Ella A. Kazerooni, professor 
of 
radiology 
and 
internal 
medicine 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine, said she wants to 
know more about the final 
outcome 
of 
the 
working 
group’s 
recommendations. 
Kazerooni 
said 
she 
thinks 
by determining the group’s 
goals the bylaws can be more 
efficiently restructured. 
“So I think, for me, it’s 
trying to understand what the 

goal is,” Kazerooni said. “If 
the goal is to streamline the 
process and make the process 
clearer for everybody, faculty 
departments, administration, 
I think that’s a laudable goal 
and we’d really like to see that 
happen.” 
The 
working 
group 
suggested that, in the case of 
tenured faculty removal, two 
separate trials could run in 
conjunction with one another. 
They proposed having two 
separate groups of professors 
who have no contact with one 
another in order to guarantee a 
more fair trial for the professor 
being tried. 
Astronomy professor Sally 
Oey said she felt two trials 
would not only diminish the 
quality of the examination but 
would lead to confusion for all 
parties.
“I think one of the most 

problematic things is the fact 
that they want to try to run 
two consecutive hearings that 
are right in parallel with each 
other for the faculty member 
who’s been charged,” Oey said.
The 
group 
proposed 
allowing the University to 
terminate the pay of tenured 
faculty 
members 
charged 
with 
“manifestly 
egregious 
misconduct” who are placed on 
administrative leave. They also 
discussed how a committee 

would be able to justify taking 
a professor off tenure and 
withholding pay.
“The 
pay 
suspension 
is 
created 
by 
acts 
that 
are 
‘manifestly 
egregious 
misconduct’ 
beyond 
the 
standard process,” Potter said.
Glotzer said pay removal 
would be a very rare situation 
reserved for only the highest 
levels of misconduct. Bruce 
Maxim, Engineering professor 
at U-M Dearborn and member 
of the faculty working group, 
said the two-trial process is 
supposed to place power in the 
hands of faculty.
“From 
my 
perspective, 
we do not want this to be an 
administrative driven process 
(where) the administrators call 
the shots,” Maxim said. “If four 
of the five faculty members 
on there do not agree with 
(the claim), guess what? It’s 

not egregious and the report 
will 
say, 
‘Sorry, 
President 
Schlissel, we don’t think this 
is 
‘manifestly 
egregious.’ 
Schlissel may decide that he 
doesn’t care and may decide to 
continue to withdraw pay, but 
at least the faculty had a chance 
to object and say, ‘No, we don’t 
want to see this happen.’”
Psychology 
professor 
Twila Tardif, a member of the 
faculty tenure working group, 
addressed 
issues 
with 
the 
language in bylaws 5.09 and 
5.10. Twila said though the 
language is ambiguous, other 
universities have tried to use 
language that reflects how 
the misconduct impacts the 
community.
“I completely agree that 
‘manifestly egregious conduct’ 
is very difficult to define,” 
Twila said. “... However, it 
can be misinterpreted. The 30 
or so other institutions we’ve 
looked at, one of the things 
we’re doing is trying to look 
at and see: How have people 
identified this?”
Glotzer 
said 
though 
the 
faculty is being given the 
opportunity to provide their 
own suggestions, the Board 
of Regents can change this 
bylaw without their input. She 
said more discussions will be 
held regarding the possible 
pay 
suspension 
policy 
and 
hopes people will be devoted 
to determining the outcome of 
this issue.
“These are the Regents’ 
bylaws and they can change 
those 
bylaws 
whether 
we 
want them to or not,” Glotzer 
said. “So we’re being given an 
opportunity, and in this room 
too, to provide feedback on 
what that process ought to look 
like.”

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look at 
one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA senior Molly Shea on her 
story “‘I think she was with me tonight’: Granowicz nets two goals 
on late mother’s birthday”:

“I thought his story of his journey thus far with Michigan Hockey has 
been really interesting. When I asked him about his summer and about 
what that night meant to him, he just said that he knows that his mom 
is with him and that he’s really glad that things have been working out 
with him with hockey.”

“I think something I really liked about this story is that it had a really 
human aspect to it. I think sometimes that’s rare in sports. Sometimes 
you just look at the game and you think, ‘Oh the team won or lost’ and 
you forget that the athletes are people too and have things going on in 
their lives that are often a lot greater than losing a game.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
“This is the year 2020. What significant centennial 
anniversary are we observing this year? … White women got 
the vote in 1920. That is what we should acknowledge, and 
that is very important, and I applaud that. But all women did 
not get the vote in 1920. Black women did not legally acquire 
the right to vote until 1965, with the passage of the Voting 
Rights Act.”

Renowned activist Angela Davis at the Martin Luther King Jr. Symposium Keynote Memorial Lecture

It’s trying to understand what the 
goal is. If the goal is to streamline the 
process for everybody and make the 
process clearer for everybody, I think 
that’s a laudable goal and we’d really 
like to see that happen.

“We realize that it is deeply 
complicated to ask to divest 
completely from fossil fuels cold 
turkey, so we’re just asking for no 
more from here.” 
Student 
groups 
and 
CSG 
have lobbied the University to 
divest from fossil fuel companies. 
While the University Board of 
Regents voted in December against 
investing $50 million in a company 
with ties to oil and gas production, 
members of the Climate Action 
Movement released a statement on 
Jan. 13 urging Michigan to divest its 
existing $1 billion invested in fossil 
fuel companies.
Engineering sophomore Carla 
Voigt, liaison to the ABTS, said 
the legislation will send a loud and 
clear message to administrators 
that students are concerned about 
climate change and want to see 
schools take action to reduce their 
environmental footprint. 
“There was a divestment passage 
in the University of Michigan’s 
CSG a few years ago, and that went 
worldwide, these can also have the 
possibility of doing that,” Voigt said. 
“If we take a stance on something 
and the entire Big Ten is agreeing 
on this, there’s a potential to have an 
impact. Especially if the legislation 
that they take back is able to be built 
upon in each of the schools.” 

The delegation is bringing two 
newly created positions, government 
relations 
chair 
and 
deputy 
government relations chair, to learn 
the best practices for lobbying local, 
state and federal representatives 
on behalf of the University of 
Michigan’s student body. 
LSA senior Tyler Ziel became 
government 
relations 
chair 
in 
November 2019 and said he wants 
to learn how other students have 
successfully lobbied their state and 
federal governments. 
“Since we started this year, I’ll 
get a better understanding of how 
specifically student advocacy works, 
and the roadblocks that come with 
it,” Ziel said. 
Since becoming the liaison to 
ABTS in June 2019, Voigt has helped 
the Association make an impact 
on U-M students. The Association 
launched a week of action in 
November across the Big Ten to 
advocate for the reauthorization 
of the Aim Higher Act, a federal 
program working to make higher 
education more affordable. 
Voigt, along with CSG, organized 
a Diag Day last semester to raise 
awareness for the AHA and handed 
out postcards students could send 
to their federal representatives 
encouraging them to reauthorize 
AHA.

 He had a unique sense of 
humor, adored by students 
and colleagues alike, and a 
deeply caring nature. Baptista 
said Epstein’s office door was 
always open, welcoming in 
students and colleagues. 
“He would go down to the 
mezzanine level and pester 
graduate students, of course 
in a positive way, asking them 
‘what are you up to?’” Baptista 
said. “And this is their refuge, 
and every other faculty would 
respect that space, that it’s 
theirs, but Sam would just 
barge in. And he was always 
very welcome, because he 
really cared.”
Richard 
Lewis, 
current 
Weinberg Institute director, 
remembers 
his 
first 
job 
interview at the University in 
2000, where Epstein was one 
of the first professors Lewis 
met. Lewis immediately knew 
Epstein would be someone 
he’d want to work alongside, 

and notes Epstein’s integral 
role in setting a positive 
climate in the department. 
“He was like a beacon on 
campus, both for linguistics 
and the campus as a whole,” 
Lewis said. “A beacon for 
humanity. I’ve never met 
anybody who was such a 
dedicated scholar, and such a 
warm, gentle human being.” 
Acrisio 
Pires, 
former 
mentee 
of 
Epstein 
and 
current 
linguistics 
professor, 
expressed 
how 
Epstein’s 
work, 
primarily 
in theoretical syntax, was a 
catalyst for establishing new 
groundwork 
in 
cognitive 
science and linguistics. 
“He worked in a framework 
called 
minimalist 
syntax,” 
Pires said. “One of the goals of 
this framework is to actually 
look at what has been done, 
and what’s still being done 
in linguistics and say, ‘Look, 
we can do better theories, 
we can do theories that are 
much 
more 
unifying 
and 
that are really built upon the 
most foundational aspects of 

what could represent human 
knowledge of language. “
However, 
Pires 
said 
Epstein 
proved 
science 
and 
personality 
were 
not 

mutually 
exclusive 
in 
the 
learning process. Epstein was 
a humorous professor who 
engaged 
curious 
students 
in introductory classes and 
always 
remembered 
their 
names despite large class 
sizes.
“People got this sense of him 
being a very caring person, 
and very committed to helping 

them and contributing to their 
intellectual development — to 
their scientific development 
— as people who are doing 
research and contributing to 

science,” Pires said. “But he 
didn’t leave the personal side 
out. He was able to clearly 
convey to people that he cared 
about them as people, that was 
a very important thing which 
made a huge difference.”
One of these students was 
2018 University alum Claire 
Butz, a close family friend 
to the Epsteins, who met his 

daughter 
in 
kindergarten. 
She 
decided 
to 
take 
the 
introductory 
Linguistics 
209 course when she was a 
sophomore, 
and 
ultimately 
declared cognitive science as 
her major. She recalled his 
skill in connecting with people 
and his “utterly hilarious 
and goofy” personality while 
teaching. 
“He 
did 
have 
this 
incredible academic legacy 
and this legacy in the field 
of linguistics, but he was 
able to meet people where 
they were at intellectually,” 
Butz 
said. 
“The 
concepts 
were 
challenging 
but 
approachable, because of who 
he is. He had the emotional 
and 
social 
intelligence 
to 
communicate really complex 
things to people who didn’t 
have his experience and his 
unbelievable mind.”
Butz said his welcoming 
nature and natural ability 
to 
create 
a 
meaningful 
learning experience is one 
of his greatest legacies at the 
University. 

“Anyone who knew him as a 
professor will remember him 
as someone who connected 
deeply with his students,” 
Butz said. “He was someone 
who created space for every 
person in the room, and kept 
his door open to all students, 
and who found tremendous 
joy in others learning what he 
loved, and being able to see 
their excitement grow.” 
Butz 
expressed 
her 
gratitude to have known such 
a special person, and to have 
a close relationship with his 
family and loved ones. 
“Nothing made him happier 
than seeing the people who 
he loved be happy in such 
a real way, and I think that 
was definitely special.” Butz 
said. “Anyone who knew him 
laughed more, loved more, 
and knows more because of 
him, and has endured a great 
loss.”
Epstein’s 
memorial 
is 
Sunday at 1 p.m. on the 10th 
floor of Weiser Hall.

Student 
organizations, 
campus resources and local 
businesses set up more than 
30 
booths 
in 
the 
Central 
Campus Recreational Building 
on 
Thursday 
afternoon 
to 
represent different aspects of 
mental, physical and emotional 
health. Arranged in a circular 
pattern for students to walk 
through, the event aimed to 
address all “360 degrees” of 
wellness. 
Sarah 
Button, 
the 
assistant 
director 
for 
marketing, sponsorship and 
academic partnerships with 
Recreational Sports, organized 
the event. Button said she and 
other Student Life partners 

have wanted to host an event 
encouraging a more holistic 
approach to well-being. 
“This is a great time in 
January, being that it’s the new 
year,” Button said. “You can 
refocus on your health, your 
well-being … so it’s kind of an 
ideal scenario.”
Visitors were encouraged 
to play with therapy dogs, 
pot small plants, eat healthy 
food 
and 
enter 
giveaways. 
Throughout 
the 
event, 
MDining, University Credit 
Union 
and 
Counseling 
& 
Psychological Services hosted 
hourly 
free 
educational 
workshops.
Engineering junior Devin 
Gohel, a student manager at the 
Computer Showcase, described 
how the Showcase is currently 

exploring fitness technology in 
hopes of encouraging people to 
improve their physical health. 
“We’re 
here 
showcasing 
some of the fitness technology 
we offer … like demonstrating 
different features, especially 
the workout app on the Apple 
Watch,” Gohel said.
LSA senior Caroline Baloga 
worked a booth representing 
the student-led campus farm. 
She 
said 
the 
organization 
wants to increase access to 
produce for students who live 
off-campus by selling their 
produce in retail locations 
such as Maizie’s Kitchen and 
Market and Munger Graduate 
Residences.
“Our motto is that we grow 
food for students, by students,” 
Baloga said.

To adjust to the influx of 
customers, the location has 
hired six additional staff. The 
store is staying open for an 
extra three hours to reduce 
lines and wait times once the 
new staff are trained. 
Currently, 
approximately 
93 
percent 
of 
customers 
at 
Skymint’s 
Ann 
Arbor 
location 
are 
recreational 
users, according to Ransom. 
However, 
Skymint 
has 
taken 
measures 
to 
ensure 
medical users are minimally 
affected by the inflated wait 
times caused by crowds of 
recreational users.
Ransom 
said 
medical 
customers are permitted to 
skip lines to enter the store. 
Additionally, she said one of 
four registers at checkout is 
an “express lane” intended to 
accelerate their experience.
“Recreational 
customers 
need a lot more assistance; 
they have a lot more questions, 
so one-on-one time with them 
is probably triple what we 
would spend on a med patient,” 
Ransom said. “We want to 
make sure med patients aren’t 
kind of feeling that pain, so we 
do what we can to expedite 

their process.”
Currently, there are more 
products available to medical 
users than to recreational 
users within the store due to 
state limits on the amount of 
product available to transfer 
from medical to recreational 
inventory. 
Ransom 
said 
Skymint is working toward 
increasing 
its 
recreational 
inventory 
because 
their 
growing 
facility 
received 
licensure to grow marijuana 
for 
recreational 
use.That 
product 
can 
be 
shipped 
directly to the store. However, 
Ransom said the company 
aims to continue to serve 
both medical and recreational 
users in the long run.
“I think most people, once 
rec comes on, pretty much 
go only rec, but we’re trying 
to continue to serve med, so 
eventually I see our inventory 
being 
split 
fifty-fifty, 
and 
hopefully we’ll be able to 
serve the same exact skews 
and products to both med and 
rec,” Ransom said. 
The layout of the Skymint 
store, with product displayed 
in cases on the floor and 
on the walls, is meant to 
encourage new recreational 
users to browse and learn 
about products at their leisure, 
Ransom 
said. 
Customers 
can 
find 
informational 

signage next to each product 
explaining how they work 
and what to expect. She said 
that this sets the store apart 
from most other dispensaries, 
where product is typically 
kept behind the register.
LSA 
sophomore 
Gabriel 
Ferguson, a medical marijuana 
user, 
said 
his 
experience 
was positively impacted by 
interactions with staff and 
recommends 
Skymint 
to 
recreational users.
“(The staff is) very friendly, 
they talked with me for like 
an hour about picking out the 
best stuff,” Ferguson said. 
“It’s the kind of place that you 
would want to chill in. It’s very 
homey. I came out of there and 
talked for like an hour about 
the experience I had, because 
it was the coolest dispensary 
I’ve been in.”
Ransom said the company 
has 
submitted 
applications 
for 
recreational 
licensure 
at all its locations within 
municipalities 
that 
have 
opted in to recreational sales. 
However, 
the 
applications 
have yet to be approved at any 
location outside Ann Arbor. 
Supporters 
of 
marijuana 
legalization 
point 
to 
recreational 
availability 
as 
a step forward in terms of 
safety and destigmatization of 
marijuana use. Jeff Radway, 

Green Peak Innovations CEO, 
echoed this sentiment in a 
news release. 
“This is a historic moment 
for our company, but more 
importantly, it’s another step 
towards destigmatizing and 
legitimizing 
our 
industry,” 
Radway 
said. 
“We 
are 
thrilled to offer patients and 
recreational consumers a full 
range of premium marijuana 
products through a safe and 
secure supply chain.”
Eighty percent of Skymint’s 
inventory is grown by Green 
Peak Innovations, with the 
remaining 
amount 
sourced 
from 
other 
businesses. 
Ferguson 
viewed 
this 
as 
an attractive feature of the 
dispensary.
“It’s all homegrown, so you 
don’t have to worry about 
what’s in it,” Ferguson said. 
“It’s not a GMO weed with 
who-knows-what inside … it’s 
‘healthy weed.’”
Ransom believes knowing 
the source of the marijuana 
is a crucial factor that sets 
recreational marijuana sold 
in dispensaries apart from the 
black market.
“This offers clean, clean 
product,” Ransom said. “They 
know where it’s grown, they 
know how it’s been processed, 
it’s all been tested, it’s safe. It’s 
nothing but beneficial really.”

LSA senior Yara El-Tawil, 
Egyptian Students Association 
representative, 
shared 
the 
process of making bookmarks 
decorated with hieroglyphics. 
She said this is a part of her 
culture’s history. 
“Culture night is a night of a 
unity of a bunch of cultures to 
come together and showcase 
something about themselves 
that they’re really proud of,” 
El-Tawil said. “It’s a night of 
appreciation of everyone else.”
Murad 
Ali, 
a 
graduate 
student 
at 
the 
University 
of Texas at Dallas, said he 
traveled to Ann Arbor to attend 

the event.
“Paani is the reason we’re 
here,” Ali said. “It’s pretty cool 
to see the different cultures, 
different perspectives, and the 
different dresses. … So it’s cool 
that they’re putting their name 
out there by combining all 
the cultures and introducing 
themselves to all these cultures 
and ethnicities.”
Himmati said she believes the 
event helps attendees contest 
negative media representation 
of their countries and cultures. 
“The reason culture night 
came to be was because modern 
media usually portrays a lot 
of the countries that are going 
to be showcased at this event 
solely as victims of political 
warfare,” Himmati said. “We 

wanted to have a celebration 
where we could showcase more 
than that.”
According 
to 
Himmati, 
Paani ultimately hopes to bring 
together 
different 
cultural 
communities toward positive 
change. 
“These are all so rich and 
beautiful, and culture night is 
supposed to be a celebration 
of that cultural empowerment, 
so that all the different orgs 
on campus can be at a unified 
front,” Himmati said. “We 
can not only learn to honor 
the generations of love and 
pride from where we come 
from, but also to take away 
that victimized narrative and 
highlight the diversity of all 
of us.”

can be a little awkward or 
confusing, you know, who’s 
your boss … And while those 
offices worked very closely 
together, 
the 
analysis 
was they were going to 
streamline the reporting 
relationship to the office.”
OIE 
has 
undergone 
a 
number 
of 
additional 
operational 
changes 
in 
the 
past 
year. 
Tamiko 
Strickman 
became 
the 
director of OIE on Jan. 
6 
and 
Elizabeth 
Seney 
was appointed Title IX 
coordinator 
over 
the 
summer.
This is not the first time 
a University employee has 
faced sexual misconduct 
allegations, nor is it the 
first time OIE has faced 
criticism. 
In October 2018, The Daily 
released an investigation 
into OIE’s process when a 
student filed a complaint 
alleging that her graduate 
student instructor sexually 
assaulted her. The student 
told The Daily she found 
the process to be protracted 
and difficult for survivors 
to 
navigate, 
requiring 
months for any substantial 
action to be taken. 
In the middle of this 
student’s OIE investigation, 
the Sixth Circuit Court of 
Appeals issued a ruling 
mandating 
that 
the 
University allow students 
accused of sexual assault 
to directly question their 
accusers 
through 
cross-
examination.
This 
ruling 
has 
been 
widely 
criticized 
by 
the campus and outside 
community, 
with 
claims 
that 
cross-examination 

retraumatizes 
survivors 
when they have to face 
their assaulters.
In 
November 
2018, 
The Daily published an 
investigation 
into 
David 
Daniels, 
a 
well-known 
Music, Theatre & Dance 
professor 
and 
opera 
singer. The Daily found 
that OIE knew of several 
allegations of misconduct 
against Daniels as early 
as March 2018 — and the 
University 
still 
awarded 
him with tenure in May 
2018. One of his accusers, 
Andrew Lipian, claimed the 
University knew Daniels 
had been assaulting him 
for years and ignored the 
information. 
Similar 
to 
Philbert, 
Daniels 
was 
placed 
on 
paid 
leave 
for 
months 
during the investigation. 
Daniels remained on paid 
leave while he underwent 
the subsequent trial. The 
University is still in the 
process of firing Daniels.
In Fall 2019, following the 
Daniels case, the University 
created a faculty working 
group to suggest changes 
to 
the 
tenure 
bylaws 
procedure 
for 
faculty 
dismissal 
and 
severance 
pay. In an interview with 
The 
Daily, 
Information 
professor Kentaro Toyama, 
one of the faculty members 
in 
the 
working 
group, 
described how their goals 
include 
looking 
at 
how 
tenure affects the process.
“Our 
involvement 
is 
basically thinking through 
what the key principles 
are and the values we want 
to uphold in that process 
are, especially with regard 
to tenure,” Toyama said. 
“But (we’re) also thinking 
about the responsible use 
of 
public 
resources 
for 

people who do end up going 
through that process.”
About a month after the 
publication of The Daily’s 
article on Daniels, Music, 
Theatre & Dance professor 
Stephen 
Shipps 
retired 
following reporting in The 
Daily documenting sexual 
assault allegations against 
Shipps spanning 40 years. 
The Daily confirmed in 
its investigation that at 
least one Music, Theatre & 
Dance faculty member was 
aware of these allegations 
prior to Shipps’ time at the 
University. 
In April 2019, shortly 
before OIE began reporting 
to Philbert, The Daily spoke 
to six students about their 
experiences 
with 
OIE’s 
reporting process. These 
students spoke about how 
they felt unsupported. One 
student told The Daily that 
OIE’s 
process 
negatively 
affected 
her 
well-being 
and her academic work as a 
student. 
“Honestly the school is 
supposed to support the 
student, (and) that is the 
biggest 
problem 
that 
is 
the most heartbreaking,” 
she said. “I came here for 
an education and they’re 
not going to give it to me, 
they’re just going to make 
it worse and I have to walk 
out of school with a GPA 
that’s not mine because of 
this and the school’s the 
one that’s giving me the 
problems.”
In this article, The Daily 
found that less than 10 
percent of OIE reports are 
investigated.
In 2019, OIE received 272 
reports and conducted 16 
investigations.

Finding a sense of belonging on campus

W

ith a child on the way, 
my mother and father 
made their way to the 
United States from 
a 
hole-in-the-wall 
town in South India 
to begin a new life 
in a melting pot of 
endless opportunities 
— 
but 
without 
family 
or 
friends. 
This is a familiar 
story to children of 
immigrants. 
Roger 
Cohen phrases this 
unique 
experience 
best in his New York Times 
Opinion piece “The Quest to 
Belong.” “New opportunity is 
only one side of the immigrant 
story, its bright star,” says Cohen. 
“The other side, its black sun, is 
displacement and loss.”
This isn’t just the reality of an 
immigrant, it’s the reality for all 
of us. Finding a sense of belonging 
is a fundamental component of 
human nature. Our identities 
are often divided into what an 
outsider can see and how we view 
ourselves. A sense of identity and 
belonging is not a characteristic 
or trait we can visibly see, but 
is rather innate and specific to 
the individual. This sense of 
belonging is often an indicator 
of the student’s ability to engage 
within 
a 
community, 
and 
ultimately, of their success.
How 
often 
do 
you 
ask 
yourself, “do I feel like I belong 
at the University of Michigan?” 
The following research study, 
“College 
Students’ 
Sense 
of 
Belonging: 
A 
National 
Perspective,” recognizes the lack 
of existing data and information 
surrounding our understanding 
of the concept of “belonging.” The 
report says, “In college, feeling 
a sense of belonging may lead 
students to engage more deeply 
with their studies, leading to 
persistence and success.” A sense 

of belonging serves as a source 
of 
motivation. 
The 
students 
who reported higher feelings 
of 
belonging 
also 
reported 
improved 
mental health. The 
study concludes that 
underrepresented 
racial-ethnic minorities 
and 
first-generation 
college students report 
the 
lowest 
sense 
of 
belonging. 
The 
primary 
author 
of 
this research report, 
Maithreyi 
Gopalan 
— an assistant professor of 
education at the Pennsylvania 
State University — suggests that, 
“We know from other studies 
that student advising, institutions, 
faculty, advisers — all of them have 
to make an effort to reach out to 
students who feel like they don’t 
belong and provide attention as 
well as services to ensure that all 
students can integrate on campus.” 
Gopalan explains that faculty 
representation and mentorship 
can significantly mitigate feelings 
of alienation.
With that in mind, it’s important 
we take it upon ourselves to 
identify 
methods 
by 
which 
University staff and faculty can 
better support underrepresented 
racial-ethnic minorities and first-
generation students with their 
college 
experiences. 
Likewise, 
it’s crucial for students whose 
identities aren’t underrepresented 
to act as allies.
It is essential to seek out 
mentors within the ranks of 
upperclassmen, GSIs or faculty 
who share similar identities to 
your own, and to actively engage 
in social science courses that 
relate to your core identity. 
This 
is 
essential 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
students, 
whether 
they 
are 
a 
first-generation 
college student, identify with a 
marginalized 
community, 
are 

a child of immigrants or have 
another campus identity, find a 
community they belong to within 
the University.
The University offers a wide 
variety of courses and programs 
for the purpose of fostering a sense 
of belonging among first-year 
students. For example, The Center 
for the Education of Women 
(CEW+) 
offers 
professional, 
academic and financial support 
to all students, in particular 
women 
and 
underserved 
students. CEW+ offers counseling 
services, funding for initiatives 
on campus and hosts many 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
events as well as professional 
development workshops. Another 
great example of a community-
building resource is the Spectrum 
Center, which provides support 
to LGBTQ+ students, staff and 
faculty through workshops and 
programs. In partnership with 
the Spectrum Center, there are 
social and support groups such 
as Out in Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Math (OSTEM). 
This 
student 
and 
national 
organization operates at both the 
undergraduate and graduate level 
to provide peer support networks 
and resources for students to 
navigate their identities in 
professional STEM settings. 
The University is home to 
a diverse array of students 
holding a multitude of social 
identities. It’s often easy to 
feel lost amid the thousands of 
student organizations, programs, 
majors 
and 
opportunities 
available. This means there is 
a larger community at your 
disposal. Take advantage of 
it. At the end of the day, we 
are all just students trying to 
find a place we belong at the 
University.

Ann Arbor’s changing skyline
T

he city of Ann Arbor, 
much like the student 
body of the University 
of 
Michigan, 
is 
eclectic 
in 
composition. 
The 
University’s 
Central Campus preserves an 
architectural style from the better 
part of the last two centuries, and 
the areas surrounding campus 
are extremely diverse in style. 
The parts of Ann Arbor directly 
surrounding the U-M Central 
Campus, commonly referred to 
as “downtown Ann Arbor,” have 
continued to attract businesses to 
their historic storefronts around 
areas like North Main Street, 
East Liberty Street and South 
University Avenue. 
The 
preservation 
of 
architecture and the upkeep of 
historic buildings are inherent 
to the identity of Ann Arbor. 
The 
ability 
to 
physically 
interact with the history of a 
city and to observe the period-
specific style with which a 
city’s 
buildings 
were 
built 
are culturally vital to the city 
itself. The historic downtown 
storefronts and homes are a key 
part of Ann Arbor’s image, but 
the construction of over a dozen 
high rise apartment buildings in 
downtown Ann Arbor over the 
last sixteen years has clashed 
with the goal of preserving 
the look of small and historic 
downtown Ann Arbor.
However, these old buildings 
are home to modern people, 
and the economic development 
in Ann Arbor has inherently 
driven the city skyward. This 
can be seen as a threat to the 
cultural history of Ann Arbor, 
as this economic development 
may change the city forever. 
But to reject development is to 
reject modernity. Many small 
cities in the Midwest aren’t in a 
position to be critical of it, since 
they aren’t experiencing much 
economic growth. Ann Arbor 
is certainly privileged as it can 
afford to be concerned with rapid 
urbanization as opposed to mere 

survival. Ann Arbor is changing as 
the needs and demands of people 
change, and it seems unwise to 
interfere with positive progress 
toward a more modern city.
Appreciating history is natural, 
but the eclectic style of Ann Arbor 
came to be eclectic because 
of change, and the changes 
demanded by our current society 
are for modern, urban life in 
downtown Ann Arbor. To truly 
believe in the importance of 
having an eclectic downtown 
Ann Arbor you must understand 
the 
constant 
change 
and 
development that has occurred 
and will occur in attribution to its 
aesthetic.

Ann Arbor has consistently 
been ranked as one of the best 
college towns in America, and 
its continuity in keeping up with 
the demands of its residents and 
students will continue to fuel 
economic and real estate related 
development within the city. 
Adding more beds downtown 
inherently increases foot traffic 
and the amount of money being 
put into the downtown economy. 
More people and more money 
downtown are positive growth 
factors.
The scale and power of the 
increased demand for housing 
downtown 
shouldn’t 
be 
underestimated, as nearly 4,800 
new beds from apartment and 
condo developments have been 
added downtown since 2004. 
U-M has added 1,080 beds of 
on-campus housing in the last 
decade near downtown, and 

there are some 1,800 more beds 
currently 
under 
construction 
or 
being 
planned 
city-wide. 
This demand for housing is the 
transformation of Ann Arbor 
from town to city, as the mass 
urbanization (and subsequent 
centralization) 
will 
continue 
to fuel economic growth and 
development.
The city of Ann Arbor has 
depended on the tax dollars 
brought on by new construction 
in recent years as a significant 
component in the city’s budget, 
which adds an interesting element 
to the story. The question that 
has derived from this situation 
is whether or not this growth is 
sustainable for the city financially, 
as the city is exposed to risk if 
property values decrease or if 
demand for housing downtown 
declines. 
Additionally, 
those 
feeling upset about the fading 
sense of historic Ann Arbor may 
feel betrayed by the city’s decision 
to allow unrestricted growth 
and development in exchange for 
property tax revenue.
Ann Arbor has been able to 
provide outstanding public goods 
like its public education system, 
city parks and vibrant downtown 
area at a very high price tag. 
It seems the cost of running a 
growing city is the willingness 
to accept modernity and embrace 
change. Old walls may have to 
fall, but the market continues 
to 
demand 
development 
downtown, and the city of 
Ann Arbor is dependent on 
the property tax revenue from 
these 
new 
developments. 
Sacrificing part of the charm of 
Ann Arbor has been necessary 
in maintaining the quality 
of life within the city. It is a 
scenario at the intersection 
of ethics and finance, but to 
be truly modern and urban is 
to promote development and 
change in all endeavors.

Learning to be open to new experiences

T

he college experience 
is 
something 
to 
be 
cherished 
forever, 
or 
so we’re told. Our parents talk 
about college as the peaks of their 
lives, filled with opportunities 
they’ll never have access to 
again. In some ways they make 
it seem like life goes downhill 
after college, almost like adults 
become zombies inundated on 
repetitive lifestyles. With that in 
mind, I embarked on a four-year 
quest to make memories. After 
three years I find myself looking 
back on what was, admittedly, a 
wild ride. I made new friends, 
tried new things and lived what 
could only be described as a 
hectic, chaotic but ultimately 
fun lifestyle. 
So why is it that upon 
reflection I have this underlying 
worry that I missed out, or 
didn’t live it to the fullest? I feel 
regret that I didn’t reach out 
to more people and completely 
break out of my mold, or step 
out of my comfort zone in the 
pursuit of trying new things — 
maybe joining clubs I normally 
wouldn’t have in the event I 
might gain a new hobby or 
interest. I think these types of 
feelings are normal, and some 
of their roots may lie in how 
our lives are constructed by the 
older generation and societal 
norms.
By graduation I will be 
21 years old. According to a 
2019 study, the average life 
expectancy for someone with 
a college is at least 79, meaning 
I am presumably not even 
halfway through my life. Yet 
I am being told by society, 
including 
pop 
culture 
and 
media, that what happens now 
seals my fate for the rest of my 
life. The cultural perception 
that this decade is the most 
important of our lives may be 

true, but is definitely overstated. 
The fear I have expressed 
regarding college may be framed 
differently than the average 
student. I find that I am less 
worried about the present as 
a means to properly prepare 
for the future and more about 
not enjoying it for what it is 
worth. If I had to guess, I would 
think the thoughts that mainly 
preoccupy the everyday student 
are schoolwork and advancing 
their academic future, enabling 
them to have a career to support 
their future lifestyle. But these 
two 
perspectives 
aren’t 
as 
dissimilar as they would appear 
and both stem from a basic 
mindset. Our time is short and 

we have to make it count. To a lot 
of college students, if we don’t 
do so our future is in jeopardy. 
After all, isn’t the point of 
college to provide a stepping 
stone between avenues of our 
lives and ensure a smooth 
transition? 
One of my best friends came 
to college not knowing what 
he wanted for his future. He 
enjoyed biology — specifically 
anatomy and physiology — 
and thus assumed a pre-med 
track was best for him, only 
to find after two years of 
taking the prerequisites, that 
he was not interested in them. 
Now he had to battle the idea 
that he had wasted two years 

of college. After pondering 
for nearly a full semester 
about what he would do, he 
remembered a hidden passion 
for ceramics he had in high 
school. Channeling a love 
for creating and designing, 
he is now in the Taubman 
College of Architecture and 
Urban 
Planning, 
and 
will 
spend an extra semester to 
graduate. His concern was one 
often voiced by students, the 
dreaded future mid-life crisis. 
Instead of focusing our future 
on what we love now, we try 
and guess at what we’ll still 
love then. 
College 
is 
definitely 
preparatory in nature, but 
it isn’t so much about what 
you do or what you learn. 
Rather it is about developing 
an appreciation for learning 
and seeing new things. I 
realize now that the memories 
themselves 
aren’t 
what’s 
important when I look back 
on my college experience, 
but 
what 
those 
memories 
taught 
me 
about 
life. 
In 
my friend’s case, it doesn’t 
matter that the University 
of 
Michigan 
unveiled 
his 
love for architecture. What 
matters is that it showed him 
his interests were subject to 
change, and there is always 
an avenue to pursue them. The 
world is big, and there’s so much 
there to explore and discover. 
College does an excellent job 
of conveying this. If one can 
incorporate this lesson into 
the rest of their life, it provides 
far more value than a diploma, 
because no matter what happens 
one can sleep easily knowing 
there is more to explore and a 
sea of opportunity ahead.

There are no Kinks in The Kinks, no Smiths 
in The Smiths, not a stroke in the The Strokes 
to be found. Perhaps then, to some surprise, 
front woman María of The Marías seems 
anything but out of place. María (who leaves off 
her surname in press) is the focal point of the 
band’s aesthetic, supplying the velvety vocals 
to the songs she co-writes, wearing the bob of 
black hair recognizable on the album art of all 
of their EPs, releasing singles and song-snippets 
with clips from Goddard’s “Vivre sa Vie” and 
Almodovar’s “Los Amantes Pasajeros.” A Puerto 
Rican LA transplant who grew up in Atlanta, 
María sings in both English and Spanish in her 
songs, the band somewhere along the border 

of indie-dream pop and Latinx, though I don’t 
see any reason to force a distinction on them — 
The Marías are comfortably, necessarily, multi-
faceted. 
In the band, María is joined by drummer, 
boyfriend and co-writer Josh Conway, as well 
as Jesse Perlman on guitar, Edward James on 
Keys and Gabe Steiner on Trumpet. Conway 
recruited Perlman and James to join on after he 
had already approached María about working 
together. Steiner also functions as the band’s 
touring manager. 
The band’s platform has grown steadily since 
they released their second EP, Superclean Vol. 
II, in the fall of 2018. Their debut single “I 
Don’t Know You” recently topped thirty million 
hits on Spotify, they played festival shows and 
venues across the country for the better part of 
last year; they’re the type of band that you’re 
indie-attuned friend has already added to a 
playlist, the type of band they’ll claim finders-
fee-dibs over if their next album breaks big. All 
to say, there’s many sets of eyes and ears waiting 
eagerly for what comes next.
Last year, I met up to talk with the band at 
their show in Detroit.
***
The Marías’ day-to-day has steadied between 
projects. They were on and off the road from 
March until August, embarking on a set of three 
tours throughout spring and summer. These 
were their third, fourth and fifth tours, their 
travels taking them through some two-dozen 
cities, onto a Coachella stage, altogether playing 

in five countries across three continents. The 
great irony of an artist’s sophomore project has 
nipped at The Marías’ heels too: So busy with the 
promotion and maintenance of the work that’s 
made their name, any time or inspiration needed 
to build toward the next project pinched.
“All our growing pains we felt touring have 
already happened,” María said, “it’s been a lot 
easier on this tour than previous tours.” 
Their final summer tour, a docket of fifteen 
domestic shows, was their first with a band bus. 
The four Marías were in agreement that having 
a known space to come back to every day had 
helped them settle into those weeks on the road. 
“Since we used to drive, just the stress of 
getting to shows in the past was very draining – 
leaving on time, sometimes driving eight hours 
the day of the show,” James said.
 They told me their free time before and after 
shows was split equally between streaming 
shows and movies and playing badminton 
outside on Hotel lawns. 
***
When asked “who’s the best badminton 
player,” the band (with a shifty-eyed James) 
answered unanimously:
Conway: “Derone (the band’s touring bass 
player), he’s by far the best, he brought the set. 
María: “Then Jesse, probably.” 
James: “No way, me! I think I’m definitely 
number two.”
Perlman: “I think I’m number two.”
James: “I’m not gonna let this slide, like I — 
definitely Derone and I are neck and neck.”
The four of them all talk at once.
María: “I just heard you like to…” She mimes 
whipping the badminton birdy back and forth.
James: “No no — yesterday we were hitting 
it straight at each other for like thirty-five 
minutes.”
María: “Oh, well I missed that.”
James: (to me) “I’m not gonna — that’s the only 
thing I’m not gonna let up on.”
They all laugh.
***
From what I saw, they’re a pretty tight-knit 
group. It was interesting to see María, Conway, 
Perlman 
and 
James 
organize 
themselves 
for the interview. Immediately Perlman and 
James separated themselves from the leading 
couple, though, on all questions apart from 
those considering writing, Perlman and James 
weren’t at all hesitant to jump in. Sometimes 
the questions would sort of default back to 
María, probably coming from the fact that most 
interviews they have are very focused on the 
singer.
At some point, when I was asking the band 
about their current music tastes, we got into 
a 
conversation 
about 
avoiding 
repeating 
something that’s already been done – essentially 
the awareness (and, hopefully, the avoidance) 

of writing a song that sounds too similar to 
something else. To my ear, The Marías have one 
of the most unique sounds right now. Hearing 
them voice their fears about being unoriginal 
made me think this need for novelty might be 
exactly the reason for this style. I wonder if this 
also plays a part in their patient approach to 
recording and releasing new music.
Early last year, fighting a bout of writer’s 
block, María and Conway left the city to get some 
fresh air. They spent a few weeks in Joshua Tree 
National Park, thinking the change in scenery 

would help spur them on. 
“We’ve been there many times. Up until that 
point we’d recorded everything in our living 
room,” María said, “we wanted to just get away 
to somewhere peaceful and open – and get 
ourselves into a different mindset because we’d 
been touring so much last year. We needed to 
get away from people and clear our heads. It 
definitely did that. It was just fun; it was a good 

time.”
***
Both María and Conway were upfront about 
the difficulties they found writing while on the 
road. 
María: “The mindset of … before we went on 
tour, the mindset was all about the songwriting, 
it was all about the songs. Once we started 
touring it became, just, a different journey of 
those songs. When we weren’t touring, there was 
so much more to draw inspiration from. Like our 
heads were in a better, more creative space –”
Conway: “Sort of in the clouds.”
María: “Yeah, and then when touring, it’s 
definitely more difficult to find inspiration. 
We’re in a bus. We drive to a city. And even 
though they’re different cities, we don’t get 
to explore as much as people think. It’s pretty 
monotonous.”
***
The band has turned down offers from record 
labels, deciding to remain independent. Last month, 
they released a single under their own Superclean 
records. 
At first listen, I was disappointed. “Out for the 
Night” doesn’t separate itself from the rest of the 
band’s discography. The single could be slipped into 
either of the Superclean EPs, without much effect, 
which makes sense when you learn that it’s not a 
new song at all. “Out for the Night” was the first song 
María and Conway ever wrote together. They didn’t 
think they were ever going to release a studio version, 
so they decided to share the rough cut they’d already 
had done.
Regardless of the confusion “Out for the Night” 
supplied, I can’t help but feel weary about the The 
Marías’ next steps. The band hasn’t released any of 
post-Vol. II music since, well, Superclean Vol. II, in 
September of 2018. I hope the time off toward the end 
of 2019 has given them a chance to return to their lives, 
to their inspirations, and has given them a chance to 
bring it to our ears into a satisfying new light.

MUSIC INTERVIEW

The Michigan Theater debuted Makoto Shinkai’s 
“Weathering With You” last Thursday. The director’s 
name alone made the screening an event. 
The Theater’s main auditorium seats over a 
thousand, and by 8 p.m., when the showing was set 
to begin, there were hardly any seats left. It was the 
most packed I’ve seen the theater for anything that 
wasn’t “The Room.” My co-reviewer and I shoved 
ourselves up against the balcony railing. There was 
nervous chatter throughout the theater as anticipation 
grew, one that was well-warranted. “Weathering” 
is Shinkai’s follow-up feature to his 2016 record-
breaking “Your Name,” which beat “Spirited Away” to 
become the highest grossing anime film and Japanese 
film of all time. I’d venture to guess that everyone in 
the auditorium had seen it.
Since before I started going to school here three 
years ago, the Michigan Theater’s featured themed 
months based around famous directors, movements 
or time periods. They’ve also had quite a few anime 
nights. Their recent series, titled “Icons in Anime,” 
will show international anime staples like “My 
Neighbor Totoro,” “Ghost in the Shell,” “Akira” and 
the aforementioned “Your Name” spread out through 
the entire semester. 
The theater’s host made a point of mentioning all 
of this before the start of “Weathering” on Thursday, 
which, while an understandable move, struck me 
as being a bit funny. “Your Name” is the highest 
grossing anime film of all time, and it felt as though, 
by screening its follow-up “Weathering” to a crowd 
of 1,400+ anime fans eager for its first Ann Arbor area 
screening, they were pushing their anime slate in the 
hopes that the crowd will adopt a new tradition of 
Michigan-Theater-Anime-Showings on Thursday 
nights. But it’s not like they were advertising their 
slate of anime debuts in the upcoming semester. It 
seems like anyone in the audience who wants to has 
probably already seen “Spirited Away.”
A hush fell over the crowd when the opening 
credits began. A short burst of applause broke out at 
the title. One hundred and eleven minutes later, a hush 
fell over the crowd when the title came back on to end 
the movie. A pause. Waiting for something more. Then 
something of a patronizing rumble of cheers from 
around the auditorium. With “Weathering,” Shinkai 
isn’t going to break the record for highest-grossing 
anime film again.
Unfortunately, “Weathering With You” fails, in 
almost every measurable (and immeasurable) way, to 
live up to the astronomically high expectations set by 
the success of “Your Name.” Its plot structure is less 

elegant, with a tepid love story, irrational characters 
and forgettable ending. Its supernatural elements are 
strangely institutionalized and unimaginative. Its 
politics on climate change and rising sea levels are 
subdued but problematic. Its animation is lacking. Its 
one saving grace is its humor, but even that might not 
be enough.
It’s hard not to see the film as riding the coattails of 
the massive success of “Your Name.” Both of the main 
characters from “Your Name” show up in little cameos 
at different points in the movie. Moments before I even 
knew who had just appeared on the screen, sections of 
the auditorium were bordering on hysterics. We won’t 
see that type of love for “Weathering”s protagonists 
if they ever make their way back up onto the silver 
screen.
— Stephen Satarino, Daily Arts Writer
Regardless of one’s opinion on the quality of “Your 
Name,” its meteoric rise to the top of the box office and 
the unstoppable phenomenon it has become, both in 
Japan and abroad, is undeniable. Teenagers flocked 
to the multiplexes to see it once and then see it two, 
three or even four more times. Comparisons to Studio 
Ghibli maestro Hayao Miyazaki were inescapably 
abound for director Makoto Shinkai. My friend saw 
it with his parents, who had no idea what an anime 
was, and they all loved it. Though I missed the boat to 
see it in theaters, after watching it on a sleepy winter 
night with my girlfriend, sharing laughter and tears, I 
immediately understood the hype.
So, scrolling through my social media feeds one day 
sometime last year and seeing a trailer for the new 
movie “from ‘Your Name’ director Makoto Shinkai,” 
I was sold. I didn’t even need to know what it was 
about; the trailer’s lovely visuals were the only pitch 
I needed. On Facebook I responded “Going” to the 
Michigan Theater’s special one-night only screening 
of “Weathering.” The months passed and the seasons 
changed. Suddenly I found myself hurrying down the 
stairs from the balcony seating to grab some napkins 
(the Dr. Pepper Stephen bought me exploded upon 
opening) as to not miss the start of the movie.
Whereas “Your Name” told a fantastical body-
swapping tale in the guise of a love story, “Weathering 
with You” is a love story hiding under its fantasy 
drapery. It’s more direct in intertwining the lives of 
its two leads: Hodaka is a high school-aged runaway 
who’s come to Tokyo to make a new life for himself, 
and Hina is a teenage girl struggling to provide for 
herself and her kid brother after their mom’s passing. 
Tokyo is swamped with unseasonable summer rains 
when Hodaka arrives, so strange and lasting that its 
citizens find comfort in myths and legends to explain 
this freak weather. 
The film quickly brings those legends to the 
forefront as we learn Hina is a sort of “weather 
maiden,” a girl who is able to briefly control the 
weather through her prayers to the heavens. Just as 
Hodaka begins to find stable footing thanks to the 

kindness of a man who runs a small pulp publishing 
company with his niece, his life becomes intertwined 
with Hina’s by chance. After learning of her secret 
miracles Hodaka convinces Hina to start a business 
clearing the rainy weather for people on special events 
with him and her brother Nagi.
From there the film wanders into a story as tragically 
downcast as rain itself, but like Hina’s power, it still 
allows for pockets of sunshine and rainbows, humor 
and levity. In these moments “Weathering with You” 
shines. The film knows exactly how long to sustain a 
joke without it becoming stale, and recurring bits like 
Nagi’s exploits as an elementary school Casanova or 
Hodaka’s reliance on Yahoo Answers for help with 
his most pressing questions never failed to make the 
theater laugh.
But the theater was laughing too much, as the 
greatest flaw of “Weathering with You” is its failure to 
let the audience sit with its most solemn moments. The 
romance is engaging and had me rooting for Hodaka 
all the way through, but it peters out in the most 
contrived (and, with the questionable stance it meekly 
takes on climate change, confusing) fashion possible, 
so much so I had to look up the specifics of the ending 
again while writing this because I thought I had 
forgotten something beyond “guy finally ends up with 
girl.” I didn’t. The film just ends. It introduces these 
heart-rending backstories and arcs for its characters, 
but never seems concerned with delivering on them.
We don’t learn the circumstances of Hodaka’s home 
life that drove him to run away in the first place, and 
the death of Hina’s mother seems more like a scripted 
afterthought than a defining moment of grief. Though 
“Weathering” could have suffered by directly fleshing 

out these points of the narrative if executed poorly, the 
best movies are like mystifying pools of water, with 
stories that expertly glide over the surface. They give 
the audience glimpses of what emotional intensity lies 
below but never outright plunge underneath.
The rains of “Weathering with You” leave behind 
tons of these tiny, shimmering (and delightfully 
animated) pools. They’re alluring at first, with an 
intriguing depth unknown to the audience, but at the 
end of the day, they’re just puddles. The movie walks 
straight through them without even making a splash.
Perhaps the saddest thing about “Weathering” is 
how strangely relatable it ended up being, not only in 
how the main character (uncannily like me) sort of 
finds a career in writing after leaving his (assumedly 
shitty) family behind, but with how the film plays out. 
It puts such lofty expectations on itself, under the 
weight of which it can’t help but struggle. “Weathering 
with You” tries to soar over “Your Name” yet fears 
even the slightest tiptoe outside of its shadow. I’ve 
been there, wanting to one-up the popular kid at 
school by becoming the class clown, but attracting 
attention that is ultimately shallow and at the cost of 
shoving down my emotions. “Weathering with You” 
could be and at times almost is a gorgeous film in its 
own right, but its beauty is diminished because it can’t 
stop trying (and failing) to one-up its predecessor.
The worst part is that we see all this unfold in real 
time, and we can’t stop the movie from imploding 
on itself in pursuit of this conceited dream. “Your 
Name” was a brilliant spark that lit a towering flame. 
“Weathering with You” doesn’t understand why you 
can’t build a fire in the pouring rain.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

The image is this: a gender-ambiguous figure 
stands in the desert facing the camera. They hold 
binoculars to their face, looking to some horizon over 
our shoulder. There’s a placelessness to the setting, 
which is made up of no more than sand, clouds and 
sky. No details or ornament in the figure’s dress bind 
it to any particular time period. It’s universal.
Diminishing 
conceptions 
of 
cultural 
and 
interpersonal difference seemed to be the larger 
aspiration of Taking a Stand, a group exhibition at 
the Stamps Gallery organized around the theme of 
solidarity-building. The show opened last Friday 
night with a crowd of about 50 navigating the 
gallery’s spaces as a DJ spun eclectic beats. This 
desert figure, seen on the event poster, was one of 
several photographs by Meryl McMaster, one of the 
evening’s more successful acts. 
Artist Syrus Marcus Ware drew in gallery-goers 
with works like Activist Love Letters: personal letters 
to activists that highlight a certain individuality and 
humanity that’s overlooked in their arduous work. 
Ware gives them the pedestal they deserve in this 
gallery space.
Leaving the “letters to” format, McMaster’s photos 
painted more vivid landscapes than just about any 
other media on display. Think Gotye’s “Somebody 

That I Used to Know” aesthetic. The introspective 
side of her characters was foregrounded by concealing 
physical appearance with body paint and sculptural 
attire. 
Another exhibition feature: a TV showing 
surveillance from some other space in the gallery. 
Simulated atop the footage were several digitized 
female avatars, each speaking in poem about feeling 
frozen. It definitely generated sympathy, made us 
consider the differences between ourselves and the 
avatars. The footage was actually generated from 
the other side of the wall. The exhibition had an iPad 
that was supposed to factor into a fully simulated AR 
sequence, but instead it stayed frozen on these women 

and their existential dread.
Artist Oliver Husain dominated the back portion 
of the gallery with his fantastical combinations 
of historical objects and events. It started with 
various drawings of a pirate ship docked inside of a 
contemporary mall space, and led to a short film, Isla 
Santa Maria 3D, that played on loop in front of 12 
sets of 3D glasses. The glasses didn’t actually work, 
though, and this didn’t seem intentional given the 
subject matter — a complex commentary on the legacy 
of colonialism via Victorian-era beach dwellers, 
visitors from another planet and a holographic oracle. 
Such an uncanny combination of characters and 

visual effects made several hundred years of history 
seem like a miniscule drop in the bucket of time. It 
displaced us from the arbitrary rules of everyday 
life, making us look inward in much the same way as 
McMaster’s photographs do.
Yet again, though, the technical delivery fell short. 
The whole point of the event was to position the 
gallery as a space of potentially vital conversations 
about political injustice, but the gallery was hardly 
vital. Friday night’s gallery-goers were hardly 
inclined to talk to one another any more than they 
would have on the street. The art on display did some 
work to dissolve our notions of national boundaries, 
but lacked new takes on what the gallery space can be. 
The idea of an interactive video game sequence is 
good, but the reality is that only one person could use 
the iPad at once. Each work engaged the audience in 
a different way, but why not force people out of their 
comfort zones? If the aim was to persuade through 
solidarity, why not actually position people as the 
minority for once? Or have a gallery of team-building 
exercises?
Each artist was acting from their inner self, and by 
no means followed a prompt. Their work happened 
to be featured with others’ under a unifying theme, 
but it just didn’t collectively convince. The Stamps 
Gallery is an important space, and has more potential 
than this.

The ridiculous TV of the 
late 2000s: ‘Kid Nation’

IAN HARRIS
Daily Entertainment Columnist

My house recently stumbled upon a gold mine. 
While casually browsing through YouTube one 
of my housemates came across a video entitled 
“Was Kid Nation the worst reality show ever?” 
After watching only two minutes of this video, 
my friend turned it off and immediately texted 
the group chat with two simple words: New show.
Over the course of syllabus week my friends 
and I binged all twelve episodes of “Kid Nation,” a 
short lived CBS reality show that aired in the fall 
of 2007. The premise is as insane as it is simple. 
40 kids, with no parents, no supervision and no 
adults of any kind, will take over an abandoned 
town in the middle of the desert and attempt 
to form the first ever Kid Nation. The kids are 
split into four “districts” and they compete in 
challenges to determine what role in society 
they will hold. Each week one kid is awarded a 
solid gold star by the elected town council, worth 
20,000 real world dollars.
The show is bananas. The fact that it ever 
existed it all is mindboggling. A Wikipedia 
search reveals that the shows producers actually 
classified and registered the set as a summer camp 
in order to avoid child labor laws. This is just one 
small factoid in the sea of madness that is “Kid 
Nation.” The show can only be found in grainy 
YouTube videos, because CBS all but denies it’s 
existence. While the entire thing is easily found, 
the subpar audio and video quality honestly kind 
of adds to the reality of the experience these kids 
are going through. The entire aesthetic of the 
presentation adds to the strange feeling you have 
while watching, that what you’re seeing shouldn’t 
actually exist.
The people in charge of this show put a group 
of tweens in a desert with minimal commodities 
or utilities and more or less sat back to see what 
would happen. From that standpoint, the show 
is cleanly divided in half. During the first half of 
the season, the town council featured four kids 
appointed by the producers at the start of the 
show. This led to a number of kids questioning 
the authority of leaders that were not chosen for 
them, some kids refused to do the jobs assigned 
to them, while others got into fights with each 
other. Obstacles as simple as cooking mac and 
cheese became gigantic issues with eight year 
olds dumping in more pasta than the pan can fill.
The first half of the season is filled with 
ridiculous nonsense like this, from kids eating 
so much candy they have sugar hangovers the 
next day to kids arguing which religion is best 
based only on the religions name. The chaos of 

kids trying to live by themselves is a setup rife 
with drama and conflict, but one that continually 
makes you wonder if it’s all right for you to be 
enjoying what you’re seeing. This show is kinda 
messed up. The entire premise is predicated on 
using kids’ pain to bring entertainment to the 
audience. How you square that is up to you, but 
the show was cancelled after one short season, 
so it’s doubtful watching it now is really causing 
anyone harm.
However, in the back half of the series things 
take an interesting turn. After (spoiler alert) 
holding an election, throwing out the original 
town council, and electing their own leaders, Kid 
Nation really stabilizes. A Reddit AMA from a 
few years back that was done by one of the kids 
who appeared on the show reveals that the kids 
eventually got bored of the “game” of the show, 
playing the challenges and changing districts and 
what not. They had developed a system of labor 
that more or less worked without much issue, and 
they didn’t even fight that much anymore. It’s 
less bombastic and entertaining than the early 
episodes, but there’s something kinda fascinating 

about the end of “Kid Nation” all the same.
At one point the kids are given a choice 
between a hot air balloon ride and a monument 
to the town they’ve built together that will stand 
there forever. As rightly pointed out by some of 
the kids, the real monument to the journey they 
went on is the show itself. But what started as 
a simple reality show designed to shock the 
audience eventually transitions into a strange 
meditation on the fragility of childhood and the 
inevitability of growing up. As their final days 
together come to a close, many of the kids we’ve 
grown to know become emotional about the fact 
that they’re about to leave people they’ve formed 
a connection with unlike any other they had 
before. As the kids run into their parents waiting 
arms, we watch as they experience joy, and 
 
sadness too. It’s been said that kids do live in their 
own world after all, one where the rules aren’t 
always defined by adults or the strict impositions 
of the adult world. Alas, you can’t stay in “Kid 
Nation” forever; eventually you have to return to 
the real world. “Kid Nation” was brief, bright and 
no more. Long live “Kid Nation.”

The premise is as insane as 
it is simple. 40 kids with no 
parents, no supervision

T

he problems plaguing the 
Michigan men’s basket-
ball team are supposed 
to be early-season kinks, not 
late-January 
shortcom-
ings.
But this 
roller coaster 
of a season 
didn’t have 
any initial 
kinks. It 
began with 
seven straight 
wins and 
a smooth 
ascension to the No. 4 spot in the 
national poll.
That was seven weeks ago. 
Now, the Wolverines are mired 
in the program’s longest losing 
streak since 2015. Their loss 
to Penn State on Wednesday 
pushed this year’s team into 
uncharted territory. Over the 
last three seasons, Michigan’s 
cumulative 89-27 record is 
among the country’s best. This 
year’s seniors have been to a 
national title game and a pair of 
Sweet Sixteens.
Yet on Wednesday, the Nit-
tany Lions marched into Crisler 
Center and, in a season when 
winning a road game in the Big 
Ten is a rarity, sat in the driver’s 
seat for much of the game en 
route to a 72-63 win.
In the process, the loss 
seemed to bring the Wolverines’ 
flaws to center stage. Energy 
lulls, failing to talk on defense 
and stretches of subpar focus — 
all elements within their control 
— were on full display.
Senior point guard Zavier 
Simpson tried to will his team to 
victory by hunting for his own 
shot and showing the passion 
that’s become synonymous with 
his name, but by the final buzzer, 
Michigan was left with its third 
consecutive loss.
More importantly, though, 
Wednesday provided a long look 
in the mirror for the reeling Wol-
verines.

They didn’t like what they saw 
staring back.
“In order to be able to grow, 
we really rely on (Simpson) to get 
us going and bring the energy,” 
junior guard Eli Brooks said. “I 
think that’s where, moving for-
ward, we could do a better job 
as a team if we have more guys 
bringing the fire. Being uncom-
fortable with that position, being 
vulnerable like (Simpson) is, it’s 
tough.
“Some people just don’t lead 
that way and I think we need 
more people to step up.”
To Brooks, it’s an identity 
issue beneath the surface. Fig-
uring out who can assume that 
type of leadership role is some-
thing most teams go through 
in November — not after falling 
to 2-5 in conference play in late 
January.
For Michigan, a blunt realiza-
tion set in on Wednesday: Simp-
son’s voice can’t be the only one 
making a difference.
“It’s just about people buy-
ing in,” Brooks said. “You can’t 
forfeit the games coming up, 
so something has to give at the 
end of the day. You have to fight 

through it and take pride in it.”
Granted, the Wolverines have 
been without junior forward 
Isaiah Livers — who was their 
leading scorer when he sustained 
a groin injury on Dec. 21 — for 
over a month. Surviving in a can-
nibalistic conference without 
an integral piece is difficult, but 
that should have no correlation 
with energy, focus and defensive 
communication.
“It’s too late in the season for, 
you know, I have to beg our guys 
to communicate on defense,” 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
said. “Not just on the defensive 
end, on the offensive end, too. It 
just so happens it’s a lost art in 
the game and we have to bring 
it back.
“Yes, I’m old school, but in 
order for us to forge ahead and 
move forward and improve, 
communication has to be a part 
of the process. That is surprising 
that some of our guys don’t like 
talking on defense. … There’s a 
lot of guessing going on, and I 
just don’t understand it.”
Howard often lauds his group 
for being solution-based, but 
it’s going to take more than 

just ideas for the Wolverines 
to reverse course after losing 
four of their last five conference 
games.
Coming up with the right 
ideas is one thing. Success-
fully putting them into motion 
is another. With March just 
five weeks away, Brooks knows 
Michigan must prioritize the 
latter.
“I feel like I can be a more 
vocal person,” Brooks said. “Just 
by being in the right spot and 
trying to get other people in 
the right spot and bringing that 
energy. I know that’s not who I 
am but I could be that.”
Now that the problem has 
been diagnosed, it becomes a 
matter of how quickly the Wol-
verines can solve it. At this point, 
the direction of their season 
hinges on it.
“It’s January 22,” an exasper-
ated Howard said at the post-
game podium, toeing the line 
between frustration and plea.
And that’s the point.

The wrong time for soul searching

Junior forward Eli Brooks said that Michigan needs people to step up after Wednesday’s loss to Penn State.

‘M’ hopes to stop threes

Ohio State is not a very good 
3-point shooting team. 
It’s made just 31.6 percent of 
its 3-pointers this season, the 
fourth-worst mark in the Big 
Ten. Most coaches wouldn’t 
have to worry about getting beat 
from beyond the arc against the 
Buckeyes. 
But against the Michigan 
women’s basketball team on Jan. 
9, they shot 11-for-22 from three 
en route to a 78-69 win.
Maryland’s a little better. It’s 
shot a respectable 36.8 percent 
on 3-pointers, good for third in 
the Big Ten. 
Just like Ohio State, the 
Terrapins exceeded their season 
average against the Wolverines, 
shooting 10-of-21 from three — 
and 6-for-8 in the second half — 
in their blowout win on Jan. 12. 
A week later, the same thing 
happened again, when Nebraska 
shattered 
its 
33.8 
percent 
average and went 12-of-24 from 
beyond the arc in their win over 
Michigan. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
inability 
to defend the three has been 
central 
to 
their 
struggles 
recently. They’ve lost three of 
their last four games, and with 
three of the Big Ten’s top teams 
— Rutgers, Northwestern and 
Iowa — up next on the schedule, 
they desperately need to resolve 
this problem to bounce back. 
“I think we have to just 
change our gameplan,” senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson said. 
“Most of the time going into the 
game (our opponent) had had 
a poor shooting night before, 
or 
multiple 
poor 
shooting 
nights. I’m not saying we don’t 
defend the three, but we don’t 
(emphasize) it as much as we 
should, and in the game when 
they start hitting them, we don’t 
adjust, so we’re not able to … take 
away the shot.”
Except for the Maryland 
game, Michigan has held its 

own well into the second half 
of all its recent contests. The 
Wolverines were tied with Ohio 
State entering the fourth quarter 
and led by one at the same point 
against Nebraska. 
But the Buckeyes hit both of 
their 
fourth-quarter 
3-point 
attempts, and the Huskers hit 
4-of-5 — winning by just three 
points. Michigan is putting itself 
in positions to win games, but 
its defense keeps faltering in big 
moments. 
Part of this stems from the 
Wolverines’ 
commitment 
to 
shutting down teams down low. 
They use their length to clog the 
paint and prevent opponents 
from getting easy buckets or 
offensive rebounds, and they’ve 
been successful in that regard. 
They 
reel 
in 
72.2 
percent 
of 
their 
defensive 
rebound 
opportunities, the best in the Big 
Ten. 
But against modern five-out 
schemes — where the offense 
starts with five players on the 
perimeter — clogging the inside 
leaves Michigan vulnerable to 
open threes on the drive-and-
kick. Essentially, the Wolverines 
gamble that their opponents 
won’t make their 3-pointers in 
favor of stopping the layup. 
They’ve been losing that bet. 
“I feel like a lot of teams in the 
Big Ten have balanced teams,” 
junior forward Hailey Brown 
said. “Everyone can kind of 
shoot the three, everyone can 
play inside, so when it comes to 
that it is harder to defend. Just 
because if everyone’s a 3-point 
threat then you gotta take away 
something, so do you want to 
give up threes or twos?”
If it was only one game, you 
could say that Michigan was 
just unlucky, but poor 3-point 
defense has become a theme over 
its last several losses. And with 
senior forward Kayla Robbins 
— one of the Wolverines’ best 
defenders — out for the season 
with a torn ACL, life will only get 
harder if Michigan can’t adjust.

Michigan looking to keep momentum 
going against Development Program

In October 2018, Johnny 
Beecher took the ice at Yost Ice 
Arena for the first time.
But 
the 
now-freshman 
forward wasn’t wearing the 
block ‘M’ and representing 
Michigan. He was wearing 
red, white and blue for the 
visiting team, the U18 team 
from the U.S. National Team 
Development 
Program 
(NTDP).
The 
Wolverines 
hosted 
the NTDP in an exhibition 
matchup, and Beecher got his 
first taste of playing at what 
would become his home rink in 
a year — and his first taste of a 
win at Yost, as the NTDP beat 
Michigan, 6-3.
“It was awesome,” Beecher 
said 
Thursday. 
“I 
was 
fortunate enough to get in the 
starting lineup, and when they 
called my name, 
the 
student 
section 
was 
cheering 
and 
everything. 
It 
was everything 
I could’ve ever 
dreamed 
of. 
It was a great 
crowd, and we 
actually 
came 
away with a win, 
so the guys were 
really pumped up about that.”
This Saturday, two more 
Michigan commits will have 
that same experience. Forward 
Thomas 
Bordeleau 
and 
defenseman 
Jacob 
Truscott 
will both join the Wolverines 
in the fall, and they’ll get their 
first experience playing at Yost 
in this year’s exhibition.
“Both good players, both 
good kids,” Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson said. “I know 
they’re gonna want to do well 
and show the Michigan faithful 
why they’re coming here and 
why they have the opportunity 
to come here. They’re good 
players, so I’m anxious to see 
them both play.”
Added 
Beecher: 
“They’re 

a great team. I came from the 
program the last two years, 
so I know that they’re gonna 
be really excited about it, and 
it’ll be a great 
atmosphere.”
For 
Michigan, 
Saturday’s 
exhibition has 
the makings of 
a classic trap 
game, albeit a 
slightly 
non-
traditional 
one. 
It’s 
a 
meaningless 
matchup, 
sandwiched 
in 
the heart of the Wolverines’ 
conference schedule. Michigan 
has started to build momentum 
in recent weeks, and now, 
they’re faced with a game that 
could be a serious stumbling 
block to that momentum.
“There’s 
no 
implications 
as far as either your Big Ten 
points or NCAA, so it’s why 
are you playing?” Pearson said. 
“What’s the purpose? I think 
that’s the thing that we’ve tried 
to convey to our guys. We have 
to get better. It’s a week we can 
take advantage of. We put it on 
the schedule at this time so we 
would have a game and not just 
have an open weekend.”
The Wolverines’ recent run 

came after a disappointing first 
half, in which the Michigan 
went 7-11-2 overall and just 
2-7-1 in the Big Ten. And 
despite the success the last two 
weeks, Pearson knows his team 
still has a lot to improve upon.
In 
Saturday’s 
exhibition, 
he’s looking for the Wolverines 
to 
continue 
to 
build 
and 
grow into a team that can be 
competitive across the Big Ten.
“We’ve 
only 
played 
six 
games since we’ve been back 
from the long break we had,” 
Pearson said. “We have some 
new 
line 
combinations 
we 
want to work out, the power 
play needs work.”
With No. 6 Ohio State — a 
team that swept Michigan 
in the first half of the year — 
coming to town next weekend, 
the Wolverines are looking to 
build on their momentum on 
Saturday against the NTDP 
and keep things rolling into the 
series against the Buckeyes.
“I 
think 
with 
all 
the 
momentum we have going right 
now, we don’t want to lose it,” 
Beecher said. “Unfortunately, 
we can’t continue in Big Ten 
play this weekend, but it is 
what it is. It’ll be a good test 
for us, and we’ll be able to work 
on the stuff that we need to get 
better at.”

Wolverines rally to upset Gophers

In front of an enthusiastic 
and inspired Crisler Center 
crowd Sunday afternoon, the 
Michigan wrestling team (4-2) 
went on an impressive run. It 
won four of the meet’s final 
five matches to clinch a 22-15 
comeback victory over No. 11 
Minnesota (7-4). 
Despite 
underdog 
status 
in the meet, Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet and his team 
were confident and motivated 
to clash with stiff Big Ten 
competition. 
“We thought it was a great 
opportunity individually for 
our guys to go in and win some 
matches against guys that were 
ranked higher than them,” 
Bormet said. “As a team to 
go in and beat a team ranked 
higher than us. Our guys were 
just looking at it as a great 
opportunity to compete.”
Sunday’s first half of bouts 
left 
the 
Wolverines 
in 
a 
precarious 
position 
moving 
forward. In a series of highly-
defensive and tightly-contested 
spars early on, Michigan took a 
6-3 advantage with help from 
redshirt junior Kanen Storr 
and redshirt freshman Will 
Lewan. 
Momentum began to shift 
Minnesota’s way, as Golden 

Gopher 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Bailee O’Reilly and No.7-ranked 
fifth-year senior Devin Skatzka 
dominated 
their 
Wolverine 
opponents. Both were awarded 
bonus points en route to a 12-6 
lead at intermission.
At 
the 
break, 
Bormet 
stressed 
to 
his 
team 
the 
importance of rebounding in 
the final five matches by being 
both aggressive and composed. 
In the locker room, Bormet 
specifically looked to redshirt 
sophomore Jelani Embree, who 
was scheduled to wrestle first 
after intermission. 
“Jelani needed to come out 
and get that momentum going 
back our way, using his speed 
and power,” Bormet said. “I 
was just making sure he had his 
composure and he was ready to 
go.”
Embree responded to his 
coach’s wisdom well, defeating 
Owen 
Webster 
in 
sudden-
death overtime and sending the 
Crisler faithful into a frenzy. 
The afternoon’s most thrilling 
match also came with some 
controversy, as a last-second 
takedown ruling by Webster 
was overturned at the end of 
the third period, setting up 
Embree’s overtime win. 
“In that moment, I was 
trying to stay calm,” Embree 
said. “Thankfully, it worked out 
in my favor and I was able to 

take advantage of that second 
life that I was given.”
In the 197-pound matchup, 
fifth-year 
senior 
Jackson 
Striggow was in full control 
of his opponent – Minnesota’s 
fifth-year senior Hunter Ritter 
– finishing with a pair of 
takedowns in a hard-fought 6-4 
win. Following the final buzzer, 
Striggow seemed to feed off 
the excitement of the crowd, 
raising his arms in elation after 
the Wolverines had knotted the 
overall score at 12 apiece.
Striggow competed with a 
little more on his mind than 
his teammates when peering 
across the mat at the Golden 
Gophers bench. 
“I grew up 15 miles from 
the University of Minnesota,” 
Striggow said. “So I always 
wrestle with a little bit of a 
chip on my shoulder because 
Michigan gave me a chance and 
Minnesota didn’t. So it’s always 
fun to beat them and it’s really 
cool to know that the state of 
Michigan has kind of adopted 
me as one of their guys.”
Following 
Striggow’s 
match, 
Michigan 
continued 
its 
run 
of 
dominance 
on 
the mat with victories from 
sophomore Mason Parris in 
the heavyweight division and 
redshirt freshman Joey Silva in 
the 133-pound class to secure a 
22-15 team win.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL


 The first time Nick Pastujov ever saw snow, he 
was five years old. As a kid from Bradenton, Fla., 
snow was a foreign concept to him.
 Sure, it existed on TV where kids would build 
snowmen and have snowball fights, but to him, it 
was more of an illusion. Movies were the closest 
he ever got to it. Then he got his chance.
 For the Silver Sticks International Tournament 
over Christmas, Nick traveled to Michigan, 
and there he saw it: the powdery white flakes. 
Naturally, when he got back to Florida, he told 
everyone about his encounter, especially his 
younger brother, Mike.
 So when Mike was eligible for the same 
tournament the next year, he had certain 
expectations. It would be his turn to see snow 
now. But when his flight touched down at Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport and the pilot announced 
the weather conditions, reality hit hard — it was 
warmer in Detroit than Florida. Snow would be 
hard to find.
 Unfortunately for Mike, the Pastujovs didn’t 
hunt for snow like one of his teammates’ family 
had. When the tournament was over, and the 
Pastujovs were headed back to the airport, Mike 
let his feelings show. He started to bawl.
 He cried out to his mom, Janis. His only 
opportunity to see snow was gone. Wasted. It was 
so unfair Nick had seen snow before him.
 At five years old, Mike could never have 
dreamed all the chances he’d have in the years 
to come. He and Nick had no idea hockey would 
eventually lead them to Michigan. Hockey hadn’t 
yet cemented its place in their lives.
 In fact, it was just a few years before the great 
snow encounter that the Pastujovs had learned 
to skate.
 Hockey was still new to Florida when Nick was 
born — there wasn’t even a rink nearby his home. 
All that changed when he was three, though, and 
a rink was built at the next highway exit.
 When Nick and Mike’s dad, Gueorgui (George), 
heard the news, he was overjoyed.
 Born and raised in Russia, hockey was 
everything to him. George knew he’d never be 
able to teach his sons football. Or baseball. Or 
even basketball. But he could share hockey with 
them. And so, as soon as the rink was finished, 
the family toured it, and George signed Nick up 
for lessons.
 At just three years old, Nick didn’t have much 
say in the matter. Even if he had been old enough, 
it’s unlikely his opinion would’ve mattered. 
George wanted his sons to play hockey.
 “Looking back, I have to take responsibility,” 
George said, laughing. “I pushed them as a parent 
more towards hockey than anything else. Now 
I’m laughing but I was, they didn’t have much 
choice. Basically, ‘That’s what you’re doing guys, 
you’re playing hockey.’ … At the beginning, I 
didn’t really give them many choices.”
 The next year, when Mike turned three, he 
joined his brother at skating lessons. Unlike their 
father, Nick and Mike didn’t fall in love with 
hockey instantly. In fact, it was the total opposite 
reaction — they hated skating.
 Outside of lessons, they’d attend open skates 
with their dad. Sometimes their grandpa, or their 
cousin when he was in town, would join. On the 
ice, the brothers weren’t shy about showing how 
they felt about skating. They’d scream. They’d 
cry. They didn’t want anything to do with it — to 
the point where grandpa had to intervene.
 “My grandpa would be up in the stands yelling 
at him to take me off the ice and stop, and my dad 
wouldn’t stop,” Nick said. “He kept us out there. 
At this point, I’m obviously glad he did.”
 Eventually, the brothers warmed up to skating, 
and the next step was getting hockey sticks in 

their hands. Once that happened, Nick and Mike 
were sold.
 If they weren’t at the rink practicing, they were 
in the street. They’d throw pucks against the 
house until it was so dark outside they couldn’t 
see anything.
 If street hockey wasn’t a viable option, they 
moved things indoors. In the designated play 
area — a space between two of the bedrooms 
in the family’s home — Nick and Mike played 
mini sticks. They played with their friends. They 
played with their youngest brother, Sasha, when 
he was born. And every once in a while, Janis 
came home from work and saw her mother in the 
net, blocking her grandsons’ shots.
 While hockey was the priority, it was far from 
the only thing the brothers did together. Janis 
and George would take them to the YMCA and 
they’d play basketball or soccer or go swimming. 
But there was one other activity Nick and Mike 
tried, their mother’s passion — dance.
 It was a bargaining tool. Her sons could spend 
all the time they wanted at the rink playing 
hockey with their dad, if she could have them at 
the dance studio where she taught lessons. Plus, 
it was convenient after-school care. So Nick and 
Mike took ballet. They didn’t enjoy it, but it kept 
them flexible. Once they ventured beyond ballet, 
they discovered an affinity for hip-hop.
 “I don’t remember ever being any good at it, 
but I remember my buddy picked the song,” Nick 
said. “It was the basketball song from the first 
High School Musical. That’s what we did our 
recital to. Thankfully, we outgrew that. I kind of 
wish I was better at it now.”
 Added Mike: “I mean, I don’t regret it. It’s 
different. People made fun of me for it, but I 
thought it was cool.”
 Eventually they hung up their dancing shoes 
and laced up their hockey skates. Holidays were 
spent at the rink or traveling to tournaments.
 Like the year the Pastujovs spent Thanksgiving 
in Niagara Falls, Ontario at a tiny little buffet 
place. These trips provided the perfect 
opportunity for bonding over long car rides and 
seeing the world outside of Florida.
 The only holiday hockey didn’t affect was 
Halloween, and in the Pastujov household it 
became a rite of passage.
 The family had a huge bin brimming with 
costumes. Every year when October rolled 
around, Mike would search through it. The 
bin had exactly what you’d expect for a family 
with three sons. There’s Batman, Spiderman, 
Frankenstein, Dracula, Power Rangers. The list 
goes on.
 The decision of what costume to pick was 
never difficult for Mike. He was just whatever his 
brother was the year before.
 Usually, Mike didn’t want to copy Nick. Like 
all brothers, they competed against each other. 
Not just in hockey, in everything. When Nick got 
Velcro shoes, Mike seized his opportunity to be 
the first one to learn how to tie shoes. And rather 
than copying his older brother’s style, Mike was 
the one giving Nick tips on how to dress and pick 
clothes that complimented each other.
 “I never had too good of style,” Nick said. 
“There’d be times where I’d get dressed for 
church or Christmas dinner, something like that, 
and he’d make me go change and he’d pick out a 
different outfit for me.”
 Growing up, Nick and Mike were inseparable.
 That changed in seventh grade when a coach 
from a program in Michigan approached George 
and Janis about the possibility of Nick joining the 
team and moving. Ultimately, they weren’t quite 
ready to let Nick go. But the next year, Mike and 
Nick’s team started to fall apart. It was the only 
triple-A program in Florida. If they wanted to 
continue playing hockey, it was going to involve 
relocating.
 This time, when Honeybaked Hockey — a 

different club team than the previous year — 
approached the family, Janis was willing to 
entertain the idea. They took a visit to Michigan 
to get a better feel for what life for Nick would 
be like if he moved. Leaving Florida would mean 
he’d have to get a billet family.
 “He really wanted to do it,” Janis said. “I used 
to say I put on my big-girl pants and let him 
go do what he wanted to do. As long as he was 
happy it was fine. We would come up for all the 
tournaments and everything.”
 So, he went.
 While Nick was in Michigan adjusting to living 
with a new family, Mike was adjusting to life 
without his older brother. The distance was good 
for Nick and Mike’s relationship, too — it helped 
them build a more mature, deeper bond. Being 
close despite separation proved that the brotherly 
connection wasn’t just because of hockey or 
proximity, but because they chose to be.
 Ultimately, the separation didn’t last longer than 
a year. Mike occasionally traveled up to play with 
Honeybaked during Nick’s first year. In many 
ways, Nick was the family guinea pig. When 
Janis and George saw Nick’s billeting experience, 
letting Mike do the same was an easier decision. 
So, the following year, Mike moved to Michigan.
 For Mike, the jump from one state to another 
was less jarring because he had Nick to turn to. 
He’d ask for advice on feeling comfortable asking 
his billet parents for something. Or getting along 
with his billet siblings. Or learning to take no for 
an answer.
 Plus, there was the added benefit of seeing 
snow whenever he wanted.
 While they lived with different billet families, 
Nick and Mike were reunited in every other 
sense. They played on the same team, most of the 
time on the same line. Every practice, they saw 
each other. Sometimes on the weekends, Nick 
would go visit Mike at his billet family, or Mike 
would go to Nick’s.
 “I saw him every day pretty much,” Mike said. 
“It wasn’t bad, but it was always weird saying 
bye to him at the rink and then going home to 
different houses. That was kind of strange.”
 Two years after moving to Michigan, the 
brothers had a defining moment. After a long 
season, their Honeybaked team found itself 
playing for the 2013 USA Hockey Tier 1 U14 
National Championship game. With under one 
minute remaining, Honeybaked was trailing by a 
goal to Shattuck St. Mary’s.
 After Honeybaked pulled its goaltender, an 
extra attacker skated on — Mike. He joined the 
attack alongside Nick, who was already on the 
ice. Moving back and forth across the blueline, 
Nick acted as a bumper to keep the puck in 
the zone. He swung the puck back into traffic. 
Positioned at the front of the goal, near the edge 
of the crease with his stick readied was Mike. 
When the puck came his way, he tapped it in.
 Raising his arms in celebration and a 
combination of running and jumping on skates, 
Mike made his way towards Nick. When the 
distance got close enough, Nick launched himself 
onto his brother.
 ***
 It was Mike who was by Nick’s side when he got 
drafted.
 That day started the exact opposite of how a 
normal day for Nick would go. Anxious about his 
chances, he didn’t want to be anywhere near a 
TV. He didn’t even want to have cell reception. 
And so he and Mike ended up on a deep sea 
fishing boat off the coast of Miami. Back on land, 
George and Janis watched and waited, hoping for 
their son’s name to be called.
 Just as the seventh round was starting, the boat 
was docking and Nick’s phone was regaining 
reception. By this point, he’d given up hope of 
being drafted, resigning to the optimism that 
there’s always next year. Then out of nowhere, 

he got a text welcoming him to the New York 
Islanders. He’d been drafted, 193rd overall.
 Right by his side when everything was 
unfolding was Mike, and he couldn’t have been 
prouder of his older brother.
 Through the years, they’ve shared countless 
other moments, good and bad.
 Like the time they both sustained shoulder 
injuries that required surgery. Mike had his 
during his U17 year with the USNTDP, and Nick 
during the summer before his freshman year. 
When they needed someone who understood 
the process of being injured — the pains of being 
sidelined from hockey and rehabilitation — they 
didn’t have to look far.
 When they arrived at Michigan, Nick and Mike 
faced a similar setback. In their respective first 
games at the University, neither of them even 
laced up their skates. Instead, they remained 
in their suits and watched from a section of 
the press box designated for the non-dressing 
Wolverines.
 Having experienced the disappointment 
of being scratched the year before, Nick gave 
Mike tips and suggestions on how to handle the 
situation. It made Mike’s transition to college 
hockey a lot less like the fish-out-of-water 
experience it is for some players. He had Nick to 
guide him.
 Five years after their big goal for Honeybaked, 
the Pastujovs combined in another monumental 
moment — the Frozen Four.
 Nick assisted Mike’s late tying goal that 
breathed life into the Wolverines against Notre 
Dame.
 “That was probably the coolest hockey 
moment we’ve had,” Nick said. “ … We knew we 
had to score. … It’s tough to describe just how 
elated and happy (Mike’s goal) made me. Being 
able to see him (celebrate) and just be right 
behind him was awesome.”
 Nick is set to graduate this semester, which 
means his days on campus and his games 
dressed in a maize and blue sweater are 
fleeting. But that means the clock’s running 
out on something else, too — the brothers’ 
time together. This is likely the last year the 
Pastujovs will be on the ice, on the same line, 
together.
 Next season, when Mike enters the offensive 
zone along the boards, Nick won’t be trailing 
behind, knowing his brother will eventually 
cut back and feed him the puck if he gets there 
in time. There won’t be a Pastujov celebratory 
hug when Nick nets a goal off a pass from Mike, 
or vice versa, the way there was last weekend 
when the brothers combined for two goals 
against No. 6 Penn State.
 The most noticeable difference will be the 
back of Mike’s jersey. He’ll no longer be “M. 
Pastujov.” For the first time in three years, he’ll 
get to just be “Pastujov.”
 It’s undeniable that hockey has contributed 
a lot to the bond Nick and Mike have, but it’s 
not solely because of the sport. Their years 
together at Michigan have proved that. They’ve 
lived together — by choice — the last two years. 
Sometimes they cook together. Mike prefers 
grilling while Nick sticks to the basics like pasta 
and pesto. They’ll watch TV together. On 
Sundays, it’s football. Occasionally, they’ll play 
it, and sometimes throw a ball in the stands of 
Yost Ice Arena during warm-up time. When the 
weather allows it, they’ll play golf.
 Beyond their hockey dreams, they’ve got a 
dream as brothers to own a lake house. In the 
northern part of Michigan, where they could 
bring their families when they’re older.
 And through all the hockey, dance recitals 
and fashion advice there’s something glaringly 
obvious about the brothers’ bond. Mike and 
Nick are much more than brothers.
 They’re best friends.
