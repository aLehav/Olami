Presidents of several University 

of Michigan fraternities convened 
at a meeting Thursday night 
to discuss the future of the 
Interfraternity Council — the 
governing 
body 
of 
National 

Interfraternity 
Conference 

fraternity 
chapters 
at 
the 

University. Those in attendance 
at the meeting voted to suspend 
all social activities and new 
member pledge terms pending 
investigation of several incidents 
in Greek life.

In the meeting, attended by The 

Daily, the IFC executive council 
outlined several events that have 
taken place in fraternities across 
campus that led to the decision 
to suspend all social events. The 
allegations include: claims of 
sexual misconduct cases involving 
fraternity brothers, six incidents 
of reported hazing, more than 30 

hospital transports for students 
during the weekend of the 
football game against Michigan 
State as well as seven called 
during Halloween weekend, an 
unauthorized “Champagne and 
Shackles” event — in which dates 
at a party are handcuffed to one 
another until the two people 
finish a full bottle of champagne 
— which transpired this past 
weekend, multiple allegations of 
drugging members in undisclosed 
fraternity chapters and three 
specific 
hazing 
allegations 

reported 
this 
week 
where 

fraternity members were put in 
alleged near-death situations.

The suspension includes a ban 

on social events like mixers and 
date parties, hazing activities with 
new pledges — including lineups 
— 
and 
general 
brotherhood 

meetings involving alcohol.

After the IFC meeting ended, 

The Daily obtained two emails 
that were sent to Delta Phi 

On 
election 
night 
2016 

students and citizens across the 
country glued themselves to 
screens in anxious anticipation 
of who would be their president 
come 2017. As the night wore 
on, it became more apparent 
now-President Donald Trump 
was pulling ahead following 
wins in key states Ohio and 
Florida. The election was called 
early Wednesday morning, with 
an upset victory for Trump.

A Trump supporter from 

the 
beginning, 
Engineering 

sophomore 
Lincoln 
Merrill, 

press correspondent for the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

chapter of College Republicans, 
remembers how he felt when 
the results from the election 
began to show Trump pulling 
ahead.

“He was in Grand Rapids 

the night before and I was 
there with a couple of the other 
(College Republicans) members 
and so we saw the crowd there 
and we were like, ‘There’s no 
way he’s going to lose,’ ” Merrill 
said. “And then as the night 
progressed, it was just honestly 
disbelief, joy, elation.”

College Democrats had a 

different experience that night. 

A 
two-day, 
six-panel 

Bicentennial 
symposium 

titled “Impact on Inequality” 
commenced Thursday afternoon 
with several sessions held that 
were dedicated to highlighting the 
work of social science researchers 
trained at the University of 
Michigan.

Sessions 
covered 
topics 

ranging from race, gender and 
empowerment to paths having an 
impact on society. 

The 
symposium 
united 

research 
experts 
in 
fields 

including psychology, political 
science, public policy, social work, 
education and sociology. On the 
theme of “Impact on Inequality: 
Contributions 
of 
Michigan 

Social Science,” panelists shared 
their research on the issues of 
education, gender, race, poverty, 
inequality and economic mobility.

Laura Perna, a University 

of 
Pennsylvania 
professor 

and University alum, shared 
her 
research 
on 
systemic 

and 
structural 
barriers 
to 

opportunities in higher education.

“I really focus on trying to 

understand what is the role of 
public policy in improving college 
access and success, especially 
for students in underserved and 
underrepresented groups,” Perna 
said.

Perna 
discussed 
her 

dissertation on understanding 
different forces, outcomes and 
opportunity in education.

Odis Johnson Jr., an associate 

professor 
of 
sociology 
and 

education 
at 
Washington 

University in St. Louis, discussed 
how the University laid the 
foundation 
for 
his 
research 

regarding how neighborhoods, 
schools 
and 
public 
policies 

relate to social inequality, youth 
development and the status of 
African American populations.

“There are very few barriers 

for you to go explore different 

disciplines and courses, and so 
(at the University) I just really 
flourished with all of the resources 
and the opportunity to craft a 
truly interdisciplinary vision of 
some of these social problems and 
some of their remedies,” Johnson 
said.

Johnson referenced research 

on the zero-tolerance policy 
in schools and shared a story 
regarding how some policies 
have backfired. He discussed 

how to circumvent automatic 
suspensions 
and 
expulsions 

from school systems and using 
discretion in doing so. 

LSA senior Lloyd Shatkin 

attended Thursday’s symposium 
as part of his Philosophy 244 
class on democracy. He worked 
to connect the concepts from the 
symposium to the topics he had 
been studying in class.

“All of the policies put in place 

Two weeks after the 2016 

presidential election, in a speech 
to 200 of his supporters at the 
National Policy Institute’s annual 
conference 
in 
Washington, 

D.C., Richard Spencer declared 
“America was until this past 
generation 
a 
white 
country, 

designed for ourselves and our 
posterity.”

It is our creation, it is our 

inheritance and it belongs to us,” 
he said. “Hail Trump, hail our 
people, hail victory!”

Following “hail victory” — a 

translation of the German “Sieg 
Heil,” a chant and greeting 
adopted by the Nazi Party in 
Germany during the 1930s — 
Spencer raised his arm in what 
appeared to be a Nazi salute, 
which 
was 
enthusiastically 

returned by many in the audience.

The stated mission of the 

National 
Policy 
Institute, 
of 

which Spencer is president, is 
“To elevate the consciousness of 
whites, ensure our biological and 
cultural continuity, and protect 
our civil rights.” Spencer has also 
called for the creation of a white

On Nov. 10, 2014, Aura Rain 

Rosser, a mother of three and 
an artist who lived in Ann 
Arbor, was fatally shot by Ann 
Arbor Police Officer David Ried. 
To commemorate her life and 
advocate for justice for her death, 
community members gathered 
Thursday evening at the Ann 
Arbor Justice Center to hold a 
vigil. The vigil fell the day before 
the three-year anniversary of 
Rosser’s death.

The vigil was organized by 

various groups including the 
Ann Arbor Alliance for Black 
Lives and Ann Arbor to Ferguson 
and offered a platform for Black 
women to speak about Rosser 
as well as voice their thoughts 
on the injustices facing their 
community.

About 30 community members 

lit candles and huddled together 
to listen to several speakers. Once 
the speakers finished, everyone 
had a chance to contribute to an 
art piece in Rosser’s honor.

Growing up, noted cartoonist 

Art Spiegelman turned to graphic 
novels instead of television to 
engage his curiosity. Little did 
he know, years later he would 
be doing the cover pages for 
The New Yorker and writing for 
magazines such as Arcade and 
Raw.

Spiegelman visited the nearly-

packed 
Michigan 
Theater 

Thursday to talk about his 
experiences and give a talk titled 
“Comics is the Yiddish of Art.”

Chrisstina Hamilton, director 

of the Penny Stamps Speakers 
Series, said Spiegelman was 
invited as part of the Penny 

Stamps Speakers Series, which 
aims to improve student’s views 
of the world.

“All Penny Stamps (events) 

are the same thing, in that (they) 
give people perspective on the 
life that we all live,” Hamilton 
said, noting the event was 
co-sponsored by the Frankel 
Center for Judaic Studies and the 
International Institute’s Conflict 
and Peace Initiative. 

Kelsey 
Robinette, 
public 

relations and events specialist 
at the Frankel Center for Jewish 
Studies, conducted an interview 
with 
Art 
Spiegelman 
this 

summer, which was published in 
their newsletter in preparation 
for his talk today.

As an atheist Jew and the son of 

a Holocaust survivor, Spiegelman 
noted that his parents interacted 

in Polish and Yiddish and that 
influenced what it means for him 
to be a Jew and the culture he 
identified with. 

“Comics like Yiddish is a 

strongly 
vernacular 
language 

spoken by outsiders,” Spiegelman 
said.

Spiegelman 
said 
he 

surrounded himself with comic 
books. He claimed he learned 
economics from Uncle Scrooge 
and philosophy from Peanuts. It 
wasn’t until he read the magazine 
Mad 
by 
Harvey 
Kurtzman, 

however, that he really got 
hooked on the art form.

He sketched himself into one 

of his later comics and said “I 
studied Mad the way some kids 
studied the Talmud.”

Spiegelman 
noted 
his 

extensive 
work 
in 
writing 

“Maus” and how graphic novels 
became important to him.

“I wanted to make a long 

comic book that needed a 
bookmark and would want to 
be re-read. I now know that 
that’s called a graphic novel,” he 
explained.

Spiegelman 
shared 
some 

of his most favorite cartoons, 
including one that was heavily 
criticized of a Black woman 
kissing a Hasidic man, featured 
as a cover of The New Yorkerin 
1993. 

“One has to be careful when 

cartooning,” Spiegelman noted.

Another cartoon Spiegelman 

brought was a portrait of a man 
in a shooting range taking 41 
shots onto the silhouettes of 
people walking past with targets 
on their chests, which came out 
at the time of the famous case of 
police brutality in 1999 in New 
York.

“It turns out that we are wired 

to think in small pictures,” 
Spiegelman said.

For the Daily

Every Friday, The Michigan 
Daily republishes an article 
from The Daily’s archives from 
a moment in University history. 

January 12, 1982 
— The 

current record-breaking cold 
spell has claimed at least 52 
lives nationwide, including 
five in Michigan, and left 
hundreds of travelers stranded 
on the road throughout, the 
state, but life at the University 
and in Ann Arbor has 
continued almost as usual.

It is very unlikely that the 

University will cancel classes 
according to University 
spokesman Joel Berger, 
explaining that an inclement 
weather day is usually 
declared because of excessive 
snowfall, not cold weather.

Even when an inclement 

weather day is declared, 
Berger said, “The University 
never closes down 
entirely.”Each department 
decides which activities will 

continue.

Colleges in some of the 

harder hit areas of the state 
cancelled classes for the day, 
including Western Michigan 
University in Kalamazoo, and 
Northern Michigan University 
at Marquette.

For the first time in seven 

years, all Ann Arbor public 
schools closed because of 
the extreme cold, according 
to Assistant Superintendent 
Bob Moseley. Moseley added 
that the schools shut down an 
average of two to three days 
each year because of heavy 
snowfall.

University President 

Harold Shapiro and other 
University administrators 
make the decision to declare 
an inclement weather day. 
The last one occurred on Feb. 
10, 1981 because of excessive 
snow, Berger said.

About 12 cases of frostbite, 

treated at University Hospital 

and the University Poison 
Center, were the only weather- 
related injuries reported at the 
University. Barbara DeLancey, 
of the center, also reported 
several cases of respiratory 
problems.

Only a few accidents have 

occurred in the past two days, 
according to Ann Arbor Police 
Cpt. Cal Hicks, which is below 
average for the cold weather.

The number motorists in 

trouble calling the department 
has increased, Hicks said, 
adding, however, that people 
are driving with extra caution. 

“They don’t drive as hard 

or as fast” in this weather, he 
said.’ 

The Red Cross has received 

no requests for aid, according 
to Richard Smoote, assistant 
director of emergency 
services. “If lots of people lost 
their heat we would respond 
by opening shelters,” he said. 
“It would depend on what the 

need is over the next couple of 
days.”

Detroit Edison reported 

that no power had been 
knocked out in the Ann Arbor 
area because of the wave of 
arctic temperatures.

Thousands of schools, 

factories, and offices closed 
throughout the eastern 
two-thirds of the nation. 
Pennsylvania reported nine 
deaths and Minnesota, 
locked in a deep freeze 
since Saturday, recorded 
seven weather-related 
deaths. Illinois had six; 
West Virginia and Iowa four 
each; Wisconsin, Maryland 
and New York three a piece; 
Kentucky, Ohio, and New 
Mexico two each, and South 
Dakota and Oregon one each. 
Reports from the United Press 
International were included in 
this story.

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Lauren 

Schandevel, 
communications 

director for the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
wrote in an email the group 
was struck when they learned 
Clinton had lost.

“I think everyone in the 

organization was really shaken 
by the news,” Schandevel wrote. 
“It took us a while to process 
what had happened and issue a 
response because we were just so 
blindsided.”

On Nov. 9, the University 

campus was noticeably somber 
and confused. That night, both 
a vigil and anti-Trump rally 
took place in the Diag, featuring 
speakers including University 
President Mark Schlissel.

“Ninety 
percent 
of 
you 

rejected the kind of hate and the 
fractiousness and the longing for 
some kind of idealized version of 
a non-existent yesterday that was 
expressed during the campaign,” 
Schlissel said that night. “So I 
urge you, continue your advocacy 
and your voices are already being 
heard. They are loud and clear — 
this is the way America changes. 
It’s the way it always changes. 
It’s the way it will change for the 
better.”

That 
comment 
sparked 
a 

petition on campus written by 
LSA junior Amanda Delekta, 
who in the letter condemned the 
University administration for not 
respecting all ideologies. This 
eventually led to the Mackinac 
Center for Public Policy filing a 
FOIA against President Schlissel 
to release his emails regarding 
Trump and the election.

After the election, the College 

Republicans 
celebrated 
the 

victory, having endorsed Trump 
the September prior. They also 
outlined their plan to defeat 
identity politics on campus, 
which they believe have grave 
effects on free speech.

“Overall, a lot of people are just 

tired of the political correctness 
and we’re just trying to give 
them an outlet,” Merrill said. “I 
think it’s going well … it is an off 
year because there’s not really 
any elections, but next year will 
be an even bigger year for trying 
to fight back.”

On the other hand, the College 

Democrats discussed shifting 
their emphasis from promoting 
Clinton to progressive issue 
advocacy.

“Once the dust settled from 

the election, we were able to 
harness a lot of anti-Trump 
energy and use it to either 
champion policies that reflected 
our values or block those that did 
not; unfortunately, it was mostly 

the latter in this administration,” 
Schandevel said. “People are 
more engaged now than ever in 
current events, and we’ve used 
that to our advantage in terms of 
building capacity and mobilizing 
students who wouldn’t have been 
involved in politics otherwise.”

In April, the Senate confirmed 

Trump’s 
nomination 
to 
the 

Supreme Court to Neil Gorsuch, 
filling the spot that was left 
vacant for over 400 days.

“I think that everything else 

aside, that was his huge thing, 
that he got to appoint Gorsuch 
to the Supreme Court,” Merrill 
said.

Later, 
Trump 
moved 
to 

implement one of his campaign 
promises by pulling out of the 
Paris climate accord, in June. He 
stated it was too costly for the 
American people and didn’t put 
America first.

“Our exit from the Paris 

climate 
agreement 
coupled 

with 
Syria’s 
more 
recent 

entrance into it is concerning,” 
Schandevel said. “It reflects the 
selfish, isolationist values of the 
administration and signals to the 
rest of the world that we’re going 
to be difficult to work with for at 
least the next few years.”

Immigration
Trump made several promises 

to the American people during 
his campaign including having 
Mexico finance a U.S.-Mexico 
border 
wall, 
deporting 
all 

undocumented 
immigrants, 

limiting 
legal 
immigration 

and blocking all Muslims from 
entering the country.

In ten months since he was 

elected president, Trump has 
been able to deliver on some of 
his campaign promises regarding 
immigration. In late January, 
Trump signed an executive order 
that would limit immigration 
from 
seven 
majority-Muslim 

Middle Eastern and Northern 
African countries for 90 days, 
a form of his promised Muslim 
travel ban.

A few days later, over 5,000 

people gathered at the Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport in protest 
of the travel ban, including 
elected 
officials 
and 
local 

officials. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., spoke to the crowd, told 
the crowd both their activism 
and legal action were necessary 
to overturning the executive 
action.

“We are trying to introduce 

legislation that will overturn 
the executive order,” she said 
to cheers from the crowd. 
“This is not about Republican 
or Democrat, we are here as 
Americans. There is no one 
who doesn’t care about national 
security … but we are standing 
for 
fundamental 
rights 
in 

the Constitution: freedom of 

religion, freedom of speech.”

Later that day Ann Donnelly, 

University alumni and New 
York federal judge, issued an 
emergency 
order 
claiming 

the deportation of travelers at 
airports was unconstitutional. 
A week later, a federal judge in 
Washington state put the entire 
travel ban on hold.

Critics of the first order noted 

it lacked information regarding 
how specific federal agencies 
were to implement the order. In 
March, Trump crafted a new 
order that gave agencies more 
than a week to prepare for the 
changes.

In the second travel ban, 

Trump dropped Iraq from the 
list and any language suggesting 
any 
preferential 
treatment 

of religious minorities in the 
countries listed in the order. 
Before the order could take effect, 
federal judges in Maryland and 
Hawaii blocked core components 
of the travel ban.

In June, the Supreme Court 

permitted a partial ban to take 
effect, allowing only refugees 
and settlers who have a “bona 
fide” relationship to people or 
entities in the U.S. to enter the 
country.

It wasn’t until September 

when Trump acted on DACA, 
something he mentioned many 
times throughout his campaign 
and after, but never outlined 
exact plans to address the policy.

William Lopez, postdoctoral 

fellow in the School of Social 
Work, has studied the impact 
of immigration raids on Latino 
communities and said an end 
to DACA will have profound 
impacts 
on 
those 
currently 

protected under it.

“We won’t see an end to 

DACA for those who have it for 
another at most two years, for 
many folks less,” Lopez said. 
“So it puts us in this position 
where we need to plan how 
we’re going to react to folks who 
have been comparatively secure 
from deportation for the last 
two years who will suddenly 
find themselves in this position 
where they can be deported, they 
don’t have driver’s licenses, they 
won’t have the ability to work in 
the same way they do (now).”

In March, The Daily sat down 

with a handful of undocumented 
students protected under DACA, 
who 
voiced 
concerns 
about 

Trump and the uncertainty 
of the future of DACA. The 
students requested their names 
not be used, but one Rackham 
student fears how the end of 
DACA would limit their ability 
to participate in society going 
forward.

Epsilon and Alpha Epsilon Phi 
members confirming the decision 
of the council.

In the meeting, IFC members 

urged the committee to vote in 
favor of the suspension because 
if the suspension was mandated 
by the University or the North-
American Interfraternity Council, 
IFC would have no say in when 
the suspension is removed. With 
this decision, the council itself can 
determine when the suspension 
will be lifted. However, IFC 
executives made it clear this 
suspension is not being taken 
lightly.

Date parties and social activities 

that have already been paid for will 
still be allowed to take place — but, 
according to the executive board, 
these events will have to submit 
bank statements and official plans 
for sober monitors at the events.

Chris 
DeEulis, 
assistant 

director of Greek life and IFC 
adviser, clarified the definition 
of a social event as to imagine 
an impartial source was looking 
at an event and it looked like a 
fraternity-sponsored social event, 
and therefore would be in violation 
of the suspension.

In a statement sent to the Daily 

after the time of publication, IFC 
Executive Vice President, Alec 
Mayhan, stressed that the decision 
made by the council tonight 
was a measure taken to address 
these serious allegations before 
resuming social events.

“As an Interfraternity Council 

community, we believe in holding 
our members to a high standard 
at the University of Michigan,” 
Mayhan wrote. “It has come to 
our attention that some members 
of the Interfraternity Council 
community have not been living 
up to these standards... We believe 
that social events are a privilege, 
and we, as a community, have not 
earned this privilege at this time. 
We will immediately begin the 

process of assessing our policies 
and practices and developing a 
formal plan going forward.”

The suspension also mandates 

a halt on initiation activities for 
current pledges. According to the 
executives, NIC will be coming 
to fraternities and initiating the 
pledges in the coming weeks. 

According to a report from the 

University Office for Institutional 
Equity, 80 sexual assault cases 
were reported between July 2015 
and June 2016.

Earlier 
this 
week, 
Florida 

State University fraternities and 
sororities suspended all activities 
after a fraternity pledge was killed 
and another fraternity member 
was arrested on drug charges.

University spokesperson Kim 

Broekhuizen wrote to the Daily 
that they are waiting to hear from 
IFC. 

“We are trying to reach the IFC 

leadership to confirm,” she wrote. 
“As you know, IFC leaders are 
students and this is part of their 
self-governance function.”

ethnostate, 
which, 
according 

to him, would be accomplished 
through 
“non-violent, 
ethnic 

redistribution of populations.”

On 
Oct. 
27, 
without 
an 

invitation from any member 
of the University of Michigan 
community, Cameron Padgett, 
a 
Georgia 
State 
University 

student 
organizing 
Spencer’s 

tour, requested to rent a room at 
the University of Michigan for 
Spencer to hold an event. News 
of the request was immediately 
met with fierce opposition and 
demands that the University deny 
Spencer’s request.

In a recent interview with The 

Daily, University President Mark 
Schlissel said the University could 
not deny a speaker based on the 
content of their speech, but that it 
was seriously reviewing potential 
safety and security concerns of 
the event.

Spencer has also made speeches 

and made requests to speak at 
several other colleges. Following 
the white supremacist “Unite the 
Right” rally in Charlottesville, 
Va., — in which one woman was 
killed by a participant in the rally 
— the University of Florida denied 
Spencer’s request, but allowed 
him to come after Spencer 
threatened to bring suit, leading 
to the University of Florida 
spending $600,000 on security 
for the event. When Michigan 
State University denied a request 
from Spencer at about the same 
time, Padgett sued. The judge 
presiding over the case recently 
ordered the parties to enter 
mediation.

Facing intense pressure from 

members of the campus and 
larger University community, the 
University’s administration is still 
in deliberation about whether or 
not it can legally deny Spencer’s 
request, and whether it is willing 
to go to court should it choose to 
do so.

“There has been no decision 

regarding this request,” said 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald. “Beyond that, there 
just isn’t anything else we can 
share.”

LSA senior Leah Schneck, 

outreach 
director 
for 
the 

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, attended a recent 
meeting with Schlissel, all 11 
University vice presidents and 
approximately 20 other student 
leaders to discuss major areas of 
concern on campus, including 
Spencer’s 
request 
to 
speak. 

Schneck said no is “still on the 
table” for the University, she said, 
and she hopes the administration 
realizes the message it could send 
by doing so.

“I think that the University has 

been so inadequately responsive 
to students in particular, even 
if we’re just thinking about the 
last year and a half of incidents 
on campus, and the particularly-
marginalized 
feel 
like 
the 

University is targeting them, and 
I think that saying no would be 
hugely powerful,” she said. “I 
don’t want him anywhere near 
campus, and I know students 
don’t want him on campus either.”

Schneck 
acknowledges, 

however, the University is facing a 
tough decision, and needs to send 
a message regardless of how they 
respond to Spencer’s request.

“In 
the 
event 
that 
the 

University decides that they do 
need to say yes, I’m hoping — and 
this is something we talked about 
— that, at the same time they let 
people know they’re saying yes, 
they say, ‘Here’s our plan for how 
we’re going to support the campus 
community when he does come,’ 
“ she said. “But that they have a 
plan of, ‘We’re going to support X 
amount of alternative events that 
are going to be on a spectrum of 
teach-ins and healing spaces,’ that 
they maybe are giving students 
the option to miss class, or that 
faculty should be understanding 
of students that have to miss 
class, that they’re giving faculty 

resources about how to talk about 
it in class.”

However, students are not 

unanimous in thinking Spencer 
should be rejected. Engineering 
sophomore Lincoln Merrill, press 
correspondent for the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
said though he strongly disagrees 
with Spencer’s views, he thinks 
Spencer has a First Amendment 
right to speak at the University. 
Protests to similar events, like 
the recent speech of controversial 
social scientist Charles Murray, 
Merrill said, have reflected poorly 
on the University.

“I want to say that the CRs 

definitely do not support his views 
in any way. We are completely 
opposed to the things that he 
stands for, and we just flat-out 
don’t support this guy. That being 
said, he has a First Amendment 
right to speak,” Merrill said. “So, 
we believe that he should be able 
to speak at the University, but we 
would also, after that, encourage 
people to go and challenge his 
speech in productive ways. The 
things we’ve been seeing is when 
people have been speaking on 
campus recently, people go crazy 
and they don’t challenge their 
speech in a productive way.”

It 
is 
not 
clear, 
however, 

whether a denial of Spencer’s 
request would necessarily be a 
violation of his First Amendment 
rights. In a panel discussion of 
several University of Michigan 
law professors on the issue of 
Spencer’s request, Prof. Don 
Herzog, who specializes in the 
First Amendment, noted that 
fighting words — defined by 
the Supreme Court as words 
which, “by their very utterance, 
inflict injury or tend to incite an 
immediate breach of the peace” 
— were not protected under the 
First Amendment, but said the 
possibility of violence brought 
by Spencer’s speeches didn’t 
necessarily meet that criterion.

are very dependent on where 
they are put in place and who 
is interpreting them and who is 
performing them,” Shatkin said. 
“So the zero tolerance policy is 
obviously something that in theory 
sounds like a good idea, but when 
you put it in different communities, 
it’s implemented in very different 
ways that will end up having 
injustices that are not meant to 
arise — or maybe meant to arise 
depending on who is creating them 

in the first place.”

Public Policy graduate student 

Juan Jaimes also attended, and 
was drawn by the presence of 
Antonio Flores, president and 
CEO of the Hispanic Association 
of 
Colleges 
and 
Universities. 

Flores holds a doctorate in Higher 
Education Administration from 
the University of Michigan and 
has garnered nearly $3 billion 
in federal funding for Hispanic-
serving institutions.

Jaimes 
currently 
studies 

policies regarding how institutions 
deal with minority groups such as 
Latinos and immigrant students. 

He eventually aspires to work 
in addressing disparities in the 
Latino community in order to help 
improve outcomes.

“I think a lot of the things that 

(the panelists) talked about are 
things that I am familiar with 
but it is just helpful for it to be 
re-emphasized by professionals 
doing work or faculty doing 
research on this topic,” Jaimes 
said. “I learned that even them as 
professionals don’t have all of the 
answers so it is going to require 
more students to get into that field 
to expand the research and focus 
on different areas.”

SYMPOSIUM

and organizer, explained the 
significance of continuing to 
honor Aura’s life every year. 
Beckley also drew attention 
to the severity with which the 
AAPD treated Rosser.

“This marks the third year. 

Aura was killed three years ago 
by Ann Arbor Police Officer Ried, 
and this marks the third year 
that she was not only tased — but 
also shot,” Beckley said. “The 
question was once: You tased 
her; why did you have to shoot 
her in the heart and kill her? And 
they’ve never answered that.”

Paquetta Palmer, a friend 

of Rosser’s and an Ann Arbor 
community 
member, 
also 

discussed the injustice against 
Rosser and said she felt Rosser’s 
family deserved redress from the 
city.

“I feel it was an unjustified 

killing and I think it’s better for 
the city to admit that than to 
keep acting like what happened 
was OK. I think that harm was 
done and that her family should 
be compensated and I just feel 
really sad that someone that 
young was taken away from us.”

Beckley was also frustrated 

by the lack of action taken by the 
Ann Arbor City Council, Police 
Department and mayor. She 
specifically called for the firing 
of Officer Ried.

“They could let Officer Ried 

go, but he still works with the 
police department. I know the 
police has a strong union, but to 
me, if they’re in the business of 
killing people then they ought 
to be let go and that hasn’t 
happened,” Beckley said.

Ann Arbor Alliance for Black 

Lives member Maryam Aziz 
furthered Beckley’s sentiments 
about the ignorance of the City 
Council on matters regarding 
anti-Blackness.

“We remember today, not 

so long ago, as Aura lay resting 
among the beauty of the art she 
imagined. Chris Taylor — your 
mayor — reiterated at a rally after 
Charlottesville that her murder 
was justified. These Ann Arbor 
and Michigan Democrats don’t 
care about anti-Blackness. When 
did they take knees before their 
lives were threatened?”

Austin McCoy, a postdoctoral 

fellow at the University of 
Michigan, called attention to 
the vigil on Twitter and echoed 
Aziz’s comments about Mayor 
Christopher Taylor’s response.

Aziz ended by emphasizing 

the importance of pressuring the 
local government until justice is 
served for Rosser.

“There is power in love, to love 

Aura is to honor her memory; it 
is to make haste and take action 
because an ultimate form of love 
for Aura is to make sure there is 
no peace. No justice, no peace; we 
have to continue to resist.”

I 

was 19 then — a socially 
anxious first-year — with time 
on my hands and a tendency 

to procrastinate. I wanted better 
time management skills and, most 
importantly, money for books and 
Panda Express. After winter break 
was over, I immediately emailed 
two people at the library about 
potentially working there for a few 
hours per week. The supervisor 
replied promptly, asking for a meet-
up the next day. I’ll call him Matt.

I was told to meet up with Matt 

and another supervisor at the café 
on the first floor of the library. I was 
a little jittery — this was my first 
time applying for a job on campus 
— and after all, I knew I might not 
get it. Matt and a woman showed 
up soon, and we all sat down at 
a small table in the corner. They 
asked for my schedule and resume, 
which they quickly glanced over, 
and Matt smirked at. When I said I 
needed a little time to reflect before 
I signed up for shifts — my class 
schedule was up in the air — Matt 
said that he was not a scary person 
to work with.

Something about the comment 

and the way he stared almost 
piercingly made me feel slightly 
uneasy, slightly creeped out and 
caught off-guard. He had white 
hair, he’d hardly smiled during the 
conversation, and he was in his 
50s, at least. I left the interview, 
feeling a little worried, pondering 
about my next step. I was possibly 
overthinking it. I was too prone to 
jump to conclusions.

I emailed Matt two days later, 

saying I was ready to start at the 
earliest date possible. I needed a 
few signatures from him before 
going to Student Activities and 
getting my documents finalized. 
He replied quickly, asking me to 
meet him for a cup of coffee at the 
same café.

It was around noon; students 

and staff were flocking in and out 
of the doors and gathering around 
the couches. I bought a small coffee 
and sat at a table in the middle of 
the crowd, pulling my phone out 
to check the time. I felt someone 
lightly tap me on the shoulder 
before he pulled a chair across from 
me and sat down.

Matt looked quite excited. He 

was wearing a tight, turtleneck 

sweater, he reeked of cologne and 
sweat and his glasses tilted on his 
nose. I asked whether the other 
supervisor from last time would 
join us. He said no, seemingly 
pleased. He then proceeded to 
ask me how my day was going, 
what classes I was taking, what I 
liked doing in my free time, etc. It 
appeared friendly and innocent, 
but something felt disconcerting. 
I tried to bottle the feeling of 
apprehensiveness rising inside me. 
I attempted to divert his attention 
toward the papers he needed to 
sign so I could get up and leave.

He signed slowly, lifted his hand 

up and paused, a smile protruding 
from the corner of his mouth. 
He leaned in, peering closer — I 
abruptly saw his white eyelashes 
— and placed his hand on both of 
mine. He gave them a squeeze and 
asked smoothly, “Are you going to 
hire me?”

“What?” I sputtered after a few 

seconds. “N-no.”

He repeated, squeezing my 

hands again, laughing quietly.

I got up, feeling flabbergasted 

and numb. He immediately came 
over to my side and pulled out my 
chair for me. I left, muttering a 
goodbye and running towards the 
bus stop. My legs felt heavy, a little 
shaky; I knew something wasn’t 
right, but I didn’t know what I 
should be doing. As I waited, I saw 
that he’d followed me to the bus 
stop. When he caught me glancing, 
he turned around and struck up 
a conversation with someone 
else. The whole thing felt bizarre, 
violating 
and 
wrong. 
During 

classes, I wondered and worried.

I ended up not taking the job. 

For a while, I tried to force myself 
into taking it, believing that 
nothing would happen. I could 
manage it, I thought. I just had to 
make sure that the two of us were 
never alone in a room. I blamed 

myself, wondering why I didn’t say 
anything to his face, why I felt a 
sense of cowardice enveloping me 
then. I also didn’t feel like going to 
the library anymore, and I’d gone 
there almost every other night to 
study. Occasionally seeing him 
there — even as I tried my best to 
avoid him — made me feel queasy 
and angry. I understood that 
what he’d done wasn’t something 
huge, but there was a chance 
that something more could’ve 
happened. I sensed it, I felt it in my 
gut and I knew I wouldn’t be able 
to fend for myself if the situation 
got worse.

I hated that I had to worry about 

fending for myself in a workplace 
even as it boasted about having zero 
tolerance for sexual harassment. 
I hated that I didn’t know who to 
tell, that my incident would get 
chalked up to nothing and that I’d 
be going against an experienced 
supervisor who was also a white 
man. I’d seen it happen to others 
too many times to imagine my 
situation would’ve been different. I 
knew if I joined his team, I’d dread 
seeing him every day.

I kept quiet for three years and 

moved on, but I remembered it. I 
remembered it when I applied for 
another job on campus and hoped 
that it wouldn’t be a man who’d 
interview me. I remembered it 
when I seated myself far away from 
male co-workers and professors in 
cramped offices.

I remembered it well enough 

to know that everything I’ve felt 
back then does matter. It might 
not be a big deal when compared 
to many other cases, but it was 
still humiliating, unnecessary and 
violating of my personal space. It 
was still sexual harassment. It was 
still the same story about a man 
inappropriately touching a woman 
and getting away without any 
consequences.

I 

hated 
running 
after 

baseball games. After all, 
baseball 
isn’t 
much 
of 

an endurance sport, and the 
punishment of choice for most 
of my coaches after a poor 
performance was making us run 
from foul pole to foul pole for 
what seemed like an eternity. 

Of course, this wasn’t the 

case for every team I played 
on, and it happened mostly 
after age 13 when baseball 
became 
more 
competitive. 

But throughout my career, the 
majority of coaches treated 
us as professionals — despite 
the fact that most of us were 
unable to do our own laundry, 
couldn’t cook an egg and 
definitely could not drive.

So, when I took my first 

job as an assistant coach for 
13-year-olds this past summer, 
I vowed to find alternatives to 
running as punishment, which 
I saw as a counterproductive 
and negative strategy. Perhaps 
ignorant and naïve, I hoped 
that my philosophy was one 
that 
coaches 
and 
parents 

across the country also shared.

However, upon returning 

home last month for Fall 
Break, 
I 
found 
quite 
the 

opposite: There was a growing 
crowd of children who were 
being trained and treated like 
professional athletes — which 
is, in my opinion, a dangerous 
prospect for the future of 
sports in this country.

Midtown 
Athletic 
Club, 

a notorious spot for aging 
parents to relive their glory 
days on the elliptical machine, 
had turned into a modern 
athletic sweatshop of sorts 
since my last visit. Unlike the 
“training” of my early years — 
dodgeball, steal the bacon and 
flag football — I witnessed 8- 
and 9-year-olds working out 
ferociously with trainers.

At one point, I overheard 

a trainer tell the parent of a 
young, 
slightly 
overweight 

boy that “he needs to be 
running 
every 
day 
to 
be 

ready for high school tennis,” 
despite the fact that this boy 
did not even seem old enough 
to understand algebra. Later 
in my workout, I was appalled 
to see a group of young girls 
running 
sprint 
“suicides,” 

an exercise I had previously 
only 
witnessed 
in 
highly 

competitive high school and 
college sports.

This 
growing 
trend 
to 

treat children as professional 
athletes and specialize their 
training 
has 
dangerous 

consequences. According to a 
recent survey conducted by the 
National Alliance for Youth 
Sports, 70 percent of children 
in the U.S. quit organized 
sports by the age of 13 because 
“it’s just not fun anymore.”

Though I stuck it out because 

of my love for the sport, 
baseball in my hometown of 
Deerfield, Ill., has a reputation 
for weeding out kids for that 
very reason. The increasing 
pressure coaches, parents and 
the community put on young 

baseball players has not only 
caused kids to transition to 
other sports like basketball or 
lacrosse, but has also prompted 
many to quit organized sports 
altogether. 
Overall, 
Little 

League baseball participation 
is down 20 percent since its 
peak in the early 2000s, a 
disappointing statistic to read 
for someone whose experience 
was almost entirely positive.

By professionalizing youth 

sports, many kids are no longer 
exposed to the benefits of 
organized athletics — learning 
the importance of teamwork, 
selflessness 
and 
discipline. 

And apart from minimizing 
the positive experiences kids 
like myself had playing sports, 
increasing professionalization 
ties into another negative trend 
in youth sports: specialization 
and overuse of the body. 

According 
to 
Dr. 
Albert 

Knuth, a pediatric orthopedic 
surgeon at Advocate Children’s 
Hospital just outside of Chicago, 

the United States sees 3.5 million 
youth sports injuries per year, 
and an estimated 50 percent of 
those come from overuse.

Where youth sports used to 

be focused on effort, learning 
core values and having fun, 
recent trends have seen kids 
training vigorously for one 
sport in order to pursue some 
sort of college or professional 
career — like the young boy 
I saw being overworked at 
Midtown last month.

The roots of specialization 

and overuse injuries lie largely 
in the prospect of college 
scholarships. Many parents, 
seeking a way to alleviate 
financial 
stress, 
put 
their 

children 
through 
intense 

training programs and hope to 
see Division 1 offers pile up.

Unfortunately, the reality 

is gloomy for almost all youth 
athletes. Only 6 percent of 
high 
school 
athletes 
will 

play in college, and only 1 
to 2 percent of those college 
athletes will see their efforts 
pan out professionally. Though 
not their intention, big-time 
athletic programs provide a 
largely unrealistic expectation 
for zealous parents seeking 
an opportunity for upward 
economic mobility. 

And it all comes down to 

running. Though I’m a fan of 
discipline and teaching work 
ethic, overworking kids to 
prepare them for a professional 
career completely defeats the 
purpose of youth sports.

I hope my efforts as a coach 

last summer signal a changing 
direction for the future of 
youth sports, and that others 
follow my lead. Though I know 
it won’t be the case for most 
if not all parents and coaches 
involved in organized sports, 
putting the “fun” back in 
youth athletics will positively 
impact the experience of many 
children and reduce their risk 
for injury in the future.

While the results might 

not be visible immediately, 
replacing foul poles and sprints 
with 
thoughtful 
post-game

Is it OK to joke about death?

ELENA HUBBELL | COLUMN

I

’ve found that the humor 
exhibited by University 
of Michigan students is 

usually pretty dark. If, back 
in high school, I had joked 
about wanting to get hit by a 
car, my friends probably would 
have stared at me in horror 
and told a guidance counselor 
that I needed help. But here in 
Ann Arbor, the same joke will 
most likely be met by a chorus 
of “same,” “me too” or even, 
“Hey, college is expensive — go 
get that insurance money.”

Joking 
about 
death 
has 

become pretty commonplace 
on campus, and a way for a lot 
of students to express their 
frustration over never getting 
any sleep and always being 
under an intense amount of 
stress. And though I love dark 
humor — I’ve been known to 
casually joke about waiting for 
the sweet embrace of death — 
I also have conflicted feelings 
toward 
how 
University 

students casually talk about 
wanting to die.

For people who have actually 

experienced a friend or family 
member dying or who have 
had thoughts of suicide, these 
types of jokes can be perceived 
as insensitive, careless or even 
triggering. I know that after 
my father passed away, I had 
a hard time finding any jokes 
about death to be anything 
less than insulting, even if 
they were not at my or my 
family’s expense. I once broke 
into tears after a friend joked 
about wanting to die after they 
turned 30 so that they wouldn’t 
have to get old. Others may feel 
differently, but I know that 
for a while after experiencing 
a death in the family, hearing 
jokes about wanting to die 
made me uncomfortable and 
upset.

But I have to be honest — 

dark humor and making jokes 
about death can be a really 
good coping mechanism. With 
all the stress that we are under 
here at college, sometimes just 
being able to laugh with a friend 
about our mutual desire to no 
longer exist in this dimension 
can help make a long night 
of studying just a little more 
tolerable. I have yet to meet a 
fellow student who is sleeping 
enough or who feels content 
with their lives and because 
of this, it’s easy to understand 
why the atmosphere around 
campus would get a little grim.

Making wholesome and pure 

jokes when you’re running on 

two hours of sleep just isn’t 
going to cut it. Even I have 
found myself making jokes 
that a few years ago would 
have 
insulted 
me. 
College 

really puts a person through a 
lot mentally and emotionally, 
and dark jokes and humor 
are sometimes what a person 
needs to make it through.

This 
sensitive 
issue 
can 

sometimes 
be 
portrayed 
as 

black and white — people who 
make jokes about death should 
be more sensitive and stop, or, 
on the other side, people who 
are sensitive to jokes about 
death should just have a sense of 
humor. I believe that, concerning 

matters of death, a black and 
white approach will only create 
more tension and won’t allow for 
a nuanced discussion.

It’s 
true 
that 
making 

these 
kinds 
of 
jokes 
can 

lead to hurt emotions and 
misunderstanding for some, but 
I also believe that people should 
be allowed to cope with trauma 
in whatever way they feel is 
best. If that means making a 
few death jokes, I’m really not 
going to complain, as I’m going 
through the same stress and 
experiencing the same feelings 
of inadequacy as every other 
student on this campus.

Still, I believe that everyone 

should remain sensitive to the 
challenges 
that 
others 
may 

be going through, and I also 
think that some part of me will 
always find jokes about death 
distasteful. But what is also 
distasteful is a school system that 
prides itself in running students 
into the ground and creating a 
general atmosphere of stress. 
I believe that we should also 
remain sensitive to the students 
forced to deal with the distress 
that this University has put them 
through, and the unhealthy 
coping mechanisms that arise.

Students 
who 
normalize 

death should be villainized — 
in my opinion, it’s one of the 
healthier 
unhealthy 
coping 

mechanisms. 
I 
hope 
that 

students can begin to see how 
their jokes surrounding death 
and suicide can be hurtful 
and dismissive to some. But, I 
would also like to see a school 
system that actually tries to 
help students learn, and not 
just put them through mental 
and emotional stress in the 
name of competition.

Some weeks ago an article by 

the composer and performer Elliot 
Cole appeared on NewMusicBox, 
an e-zine which is one of the most 
interesting media outlets dedicated 
to contemporary music today. The 
piece, entitled “Questions I Ask 
Myself,” duly made its way around 
the social media circles of the hip 
and with-it of the contemporary 
classical music community and 
managed to provoke more than a 
few interesting conversations. In 
it, as one might expect, Cole cycles 
through a series of inquiries he has 
put to himself about the nature of 
the compositional profession in 
modern society, at least from his 
perspective. And, as he discloses 
at the beginning of the text, it 
works not so much as a “coherent 
critique of anything,” but rather as 
something that he has put out into 
the world because the questions 
are ones he “wrestles with” — and, 
it turns out, ones that a lot of the 
rest of us wrestle with too.

As I imagine was the case for 

many who saw it, reading Cole’s 
questions made me feel vaguely 
guilty, as if I were somehow being 
accused of something. Part of this, 
no doubt, comes from the fact 
that several of Cole’s questions 
were the sorts of things I also ask 
myself, usually before quickly 
stowing them away in some rarely-
used corner of my mind, the sorts 
of uncomfortable things about 
music culture that we don’t like to 
talk about. Another part of it, no 
doubt, is that I am being accused 
of something, along with everyone 
else who’s part of this community. 
To a certain extent, it’s an entire 
creative culture that stands trial.

Cole’s article serves as a sort of 

solitary Socratic method, wherein 
he airs a question but doesn’t really 
endeavor to answer it. But in order 
for a Socratic style to be completely 
effective, there really has to be 
someone to play a responsorial 
role. Everyone can do this for 
themselves, on their own, but the 
following are my own reflections 
on some of the questions that 
struck me the most.

***
Am I just trying to impress 

people and get famous?

This is obviously a question 

that is more personal than about 
musical society at large, but 
nevertheless I think that it has 
implications about the kind of 
culture we cultivate around our 
art. And there really isn’t a simple 
answer to it. The easy way out is 
to just say “no,” but that probably 
isn’t entirely honest. While a 
classical-style 
composer 
may 

never be famous in the same way 
that a pop star might become, 
there’s certainly an allure to being 
well-known and well-regarded 
amongst a particular ingroup (a 
group which, not coincidentally, 
there’s a damaging habit of 
regarding as somehow “better”). 
More than that, the history of the 
genre since the 19th century is 
that of a slow-burgeoning museum 
culture, rife with cults of idolatry. 
In the temples we erect to our art, 
the great concert halls and houses 
of symphony orchestras, it’s not 
uncommon to find architecture 
that serves as a literal Pantheon of 
classical music, with busts of the 
deified great masters of the genre 
— Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms and 
the like — arranged around the 
rim of a great dome structure. And 
what pianist, for instance, when she 
hears the reverent tones in which 
Martha Argerich is discussed, 
doesn’t wonder to herself what it 
would be like to be talked about 
in that way? On the whole, the 
entire way we have set up our 
institutions — the competitiveness, 
the perfectionism, the Hobbesian 
free-for-all of finding the best gig 
— betrays a spirit ill at ease with 
itself, and an obsession with at 
least localized fame.

Have I used esoteric musical 

preferences and interests to 
feel different from (superior 
to?) other people? Has that 
isolated me? Can I in good faith 
encourage others to do the 
same?

This 
question 
is 
in 
some 

ways related to the first, but 
only tangentially. In my larger 
community, the one outside of 
exclusively classical music circles, 
the idea of my being a composer 
seems to impress a fair number 
of people (which, relatedly, never 
fails to make me feel embarrassed 
and trigger an acute attack of 

imposter syndrome). I sometimes 
worry that, in the beginning, 
when I was a middle school 
student or so, this element was 
part of the appeal. I grew up in a 
relatively rural community where 
I often felt extremely alienated, 
and throughout the process, my 
inability to connect deeply with 
many people led to a gradual 
immersion in art, first books and 
then music. As I grew more and 
more engaged in these sorts of 
things, it grew harder and harder 

to connect with others, in a sort 
of endless feedback loop. And this 
certainly augmented the process 
of isolation. Only by physically 
leaving the place have I been 
able to escape. While I feel that I 
can encourage people to pursue 
esoteric tastes and extraordinary 
musics, this encouragement must 
be coupled with an admonition to 
avoid the mistakes of my younger 
self. My self-isolation and artistic 
entrenchment gradually took on a 
harmful and condescending tone, 
a sort of self-congratulatory “get 
a load of these rubes” internal 
dialogue, the sort of thinking that 
is cancerous to both a healthy mind 
and a healthy society. Which leads 
perfectly into the next question I’ve 
chosen, the concise but poignant:

Am I a snob?
To 
which 
the 
answer 
is 

“probably, yes, but I’m working on 
it.”

What’s 
the 
difference 

between being a champion of 
my community and being a 
partisan, fighting to expand 
the size and status of a little 
kingdom just because I happen 
to belong to it?

Again, each of these questions 

is related to the others in some 
way. In my view, part of this 
has to do with not being a snob. 
Obviously I love the music that 
my community produces, but I’m 
never going to convince anyone 
else to love it by brute force. 
Partisanism is often one of the 
most counterproductive ways to 
create converts. Proselytization 
only works if people are willing 
and ready to hear what you have 
to say, and the best way to create 
an environment in which that’s 
the case is to be ready to listen to 
what they have to say. You can’t go 
into it thinking that your way is the 
best way, unwilling to hear things 
different from what you know. I 
fully believe in spreading the music 
of my community, but the process 
should be far closer to commerce 
than conquest. Kingdoms have to 
make way for democracies.

Am I OK with an aesthetic 

ideology that values making 
people 
uncomfortable 
more 

than making people happy?

This pertains mostly to the 

vanguard 
of 
contemporary 

classical, the spectralists, the 
composers of New Complexity 
and other descendants of the 20th 
century avant-garde. And I also 
feel that it’s far easier to address, at 
least in my mind. To me, the answer 
is “yes, sometimes.” I don’t believe 
that music shouldn’t ever just exist 
just to make people happy, but I 
think there is certainly value to 
be found in discomfort. Whether 
or not you believe in any gods, it’s 
probably fairly easy to agree that 
we live in a fallen world. I don’t 
see a reason why our art shouldn’t 
reflect that, shouldn’t express our 
distress at the state of things. And 
this certainly isn’t an exclusively 
classical music phenomenon: Look 
at some of the great art of recent 
years in the genre of hip hop, for 
instance. Kendrick Lamar’s To 
Pimp a Butterfly certainly isn’t 
a cheery album, and if you’re 
really engaging with it you should 
probably feel pretty uncomfortable 
afterward. But it’s great art, and 
making people happy doesn’t have 
to be the first priority of artists.

Our 
whole 
disposable 

capitalist culture is obsessed 
with novelty and progress. Is 
a value system based on the 
newness of music really as 
countercultural as I think it is?

This is harder to tackle, and I 

think the answer really depends 
on what exactly the “newness” 
of an artist’s work is. Oftentimes 
I think that art can genuinely 
be used to subvert expectations, 
to poke holes in our imaginary 
conception of what our society is. 
On the other hand, Cole is right 
to question new music’s ability to 
be countercultural. Sometimes 
(maybe most of the time, but 
I hope not) it can be used to 
support existing structures and 
hierarchies, cloaking reactionary 
effect with revolutionary language. 
Especially with something like 
orchestral music or opera, sub-
genres that require large financial 
means, music can be used to serve 
the capitalist class and propagate 
the neoliberal order. An excellent 
example of this is Mason Bates, as 
Marianna Ritchey points out in an 
article published this last summer. 
Bates, who was the second-most 
performed 
living 
orchestral 

composer in America, after John 
Adams, in the 2014/15 season, is 
famous for using technology in his 
music. Especially in our political 
era, art is inseparable from 
ideology, and the type of music 
the Bates writes — sometimes on 
commission from monied interests 
with a stake in the status quo — 
easily slides into the neoliberal 
mold. It’s a symphony Silicon 
Valley style. And Cole is right to 
be concerned about this state of 
affairs. Perhaps my own political 
ideology is showing, but to me art — 
to the extent that it can be — should 
be used to pull down our ivory 
towers, to empower the powerless 
and to change the way we look at 
the world in a revolutionary way.

Obviously, 
Cole’s 
questions 

are just the beginning of a 
larger 
conversation, 
but 
they 

offer valuable material for the 
discussions that we need to be 
having within our community. 
The few I’ve addressed here 
are just a sampling of the larger 
collection, and not necessarily the 
most important, but if everyone 
took a few minutes out of their day 
to think them and the rest over, we 
might build a better world around 
our art. And isn’t that, at its heart, 
what doing art should be about?

DAYTON 

HARE

CBS

‘S.W.A.T.’ premiere is 
remarkably promising

To all those that mourned 

to loss of Shemar Moore from 
“Criminal Minds,” 
you can breathe 
easy 
again 

knowing he’s made 
his return to CBS 
as the lead of a 
new crime drama 
series, 
“S.W.A.T.” 

Daniel 
“Hondo” 

Harrelson (Shemar 
Moore, 
“Criminal 
Minds”) 

is thrust into an somewhat 
unwanted lieutenant position of a 
S.W.A.T team in Los Angeles. The 
city is plagued by political and 
racial tension, and Hondo uses 
his experience from the streets 
as well as his loyalty to the police 
force to alleviate the restlessness.

The show moves at a perfect 

pace. The main plot revolves 
around how social unrest exists 
in today’s society and highlights 
many serious issues our country 
is facing right now, like police 
brutality and sexism toward 
women in the work force. The 
writing carries enough heart 
without being overly dramatic 
or cringe-worthy. The lines are 
delivered with weight in serious 
moments, but those moments also 
come with happier, light-hearted 
ones. 
The 
actors, 
especially 

Moore, can flip-flop between 
these two tones with ease. The 
change up between the two 
evokes laughter appropriately and 
also gives you goosebumps when 
some serious shit is going down. 

The plot isn’t the sole factor 

bringing attention to real life 
problems. The writers clearly 
incorporated situations that evoke 
empathy and show the complexity 
and 
uncertainty 
that 
these 

issues carry. For example, the 
opening scene shows how the old 

SWAT lieutenant, 
William 
Spivey, 

(Louis 
Ferreira, 

“The 
X-Files) 

accidentally 
shot 

a young, innocent 
black 
man 
on 

the street. It is 
clear this was an 
accident, 
as 
the 

lieutenant immediately saves the 
boy’s life and brings him to the 
hospital himself. However, in the 
recent political climate, this tragic 
event inspires racist attitudes and 
launches the episode into the 
repercussions of moments like 
these.

This scene isn’t singular. Hondo 

is constantly fighting a battle 
between what he values as just 
and what is expected of him from 
the police force. His character 
asks for civility, as he works to 
protect both the citizens of Los 
Angeles and his fellow officers. 
His emphases the importance 
of respect and communication, 
on both sides of the problem. 
His morality makes him a very 
attractive presence in the show.

“S.W.A.T” goes beyond the 

typical 
cop 
show, 
normally 

comprised 
of 
firing 
bullets, 

explosions 
and 
unnecessary 

tough guy attitudes. It’s meaning 
goes 
deeper, 
showing 
the 

oppression and abuse of power 
parallel to those cops using their 
badge for it’s intended use. The 
chief (Patrick St. Esprit, “NCIS: 

Los Angeles”) promotes Hondo 
in light of the shooting, replacing 
Spivey, not because he truly 
wants Hondo in that position, but 
because he wants a black man in 
it to show the public he values 
“equality.”

To spice things up, there is a 

romance brewing between Hondo 
and his boss, Jessica Cortez 
(Stephanie Sigman, “Annabelle: 
Creation”). The office relationship 
makes 
Hondo’s 
disobeying 

of orders even more saucey. 
However, 
their 
relationship 

seems to be compromised because 
of their relative hierarchy in the 
force. They both put their careers 
as their number one priority, 
which draws on another social 
issue — does one sex have to be the 
one to give up their career? Are we 
really moving toward a time that 
both partners in a relationship 
can work full time?

In addition to all of the social 

issues this show draws on, it’s 
entertaining 
to 
watch. 
The 

intense moments, like one-on-one 
combat gets your blood pumping. 
When Moore tackles the bad guy 
to the ground, you can’t help but 
feel weirdly proud. There was 
one explosion, which I think is 
a pretty good ratio as long as the 
next episodes don’t overdo it. 
Because let’s be real, nothing is 
more annoying when the writers 
clearly couldn’t come up with 
something better so they just blow 
things up.

I have high hopes for the rest 

of the series, and I’m personally 
excited to see Moore back in a 
badass role. He was born to play 
it, and his casting in a show filled 
with this much truth gives it real 
potential to deliver.

TV REVIEW


COURTESY OF DOUG COOMBE
GOOD DEED ENTERTAINMENT

In his eight years as a painter, 

Vincent Van Gogh painted over 
800 works of art. While he only 
sold one painting in his lifetime, 
Van Gogh’s innovative aesthetic 
and manipulation of form has 
cemented him as one of the world’s 
greatest artists and the Father of 
Expressionism. Van 
Gogh’s work is all at 
once 
imaginative, 

dynamic, emotional 
and 
mysterious, 

and in effect, his 
distinct landscapes 
and portraits hint 
at stories beyond 
the canvas. In a 
breathtaking 
and 

awe-inspiring effort to explore 
these stories, “Loving Vincent” 
combines oil paint animation 
with cinematic storytelling to pay 
homage to Van Gogh’s life and 
work.

“Loving Vincent” is the first 

feature length film to use oil paint 
animation. As the film displays 
in its opening text, every shot 
is painstakingly hand painted 
by a team of over 100 artists. 
These are not still frames or 
backgrounds — the artists behind 
“Loving Vincent” replicated Van 
Gogh’s style and combined it with 
computer animation to make 
his paintings come alive with 
movement. It’s difficult to describe 
the animation effects through 
words, because the scenes are so 
starkly visual; the film’s opening 
sequence is a rhythmic journey 
into Van Gogh’s quintessential 
‘Starry Night’ that launches you 
straight into this captivating realm 
inside Van Gogh’s artwork.

Every scene and character 

in “Loving Vincent” is inspired 
by Van Gogh’s actual work, and 
the 
narrative 
moves 
through 

the landscapes and portraits of 
his paintings. Each voice actor 
resembles their matching Van 
Gogh painting, and the film’s artists 
painted the characters in the film 
to resemble their voice actors. The 
story takes place a year after Van 
Gogh’s act of suicide, and centers 
around Armand Roulin (Douglas 
Booth, 
“Jupiter 
Ascending”), 

the son of the postmaster (Chris 
O’Dowd, “Mascots”), who is tasked 
with delivering a letter from the 
late Van Gogh to his brother Theo 

(Cezary Lukaszewicz, “Crossroads 
Café”). The journey takes Armand 
to the French town of Auvers-sur-
Oise, where Armand interacts with 
the townspeople to try to piece 
together what happened on the day 
of Van Gogh’s unexpected death.

“Loving Vincent” works as a 

detective crime narrative in which 
Armand collects testimonies from 
the villagers close to Van Gogh and 
explores inconsistencies in village 
gossip. The cast of characters 

features great voice 
acting 
by 
Helen 

McCrory 
(“Peaky 

Blinders”), 
Aidan 

Turner 
(“The 

Hobbit: The Battle 
of the Five Armies”), 
Saoirse 
Ronan 

(“Brooklyn”), 
Jerome 
Flynn 

(“Game 
of 

Thrones”) and Eleanor Thompson 
(“Alleycats”), among others. While 
staying true to style, the animation 
is incredibly lifelike, making each 
character expressive and distinct 
in their personality. A vibrant score 
by Clint Mansell (“Black Swan”) 
beautifully 
undercurrents 
the 

beauty of the rural landscape and 
the emotions of each character.

The narrative pacing is well done, 

seamlessly 
switching 
between 

moments 
of 
contemplation, 

reminiscence and action. One of 
the most incredible parts of the 
film is its artistic cinematography; 
the stylistic use of transitions, 
editing and angles done through 
oil paintings is awe-inspiring and 
insanely impressive. There is one 
unforgettable shot where Armand 
washes his hands in a bowl of 
water, and the movement of the 
water is intricately animated with 
oil painting to look both real and 
artistic. It’s unbelievable.

Even writing about this film 

is overwhelming because of how 
good it is. Each scene flickers with 
movement that brings to life Van 
Gogh’s artwork in a display of 
pure artistry. The only drawback 
to this film is that it is sometimes 
too beautiful that it distracts from 
the story. Lovers of Van Gogh will 
have an amazing time spotting his 
famous works and deep cuts that 
appear in the film both overtly and 
subtly. “Loving Vincent” expertly 
combines narrative storytelling, 
artistic 
cinematography 
and 

breathtaking animation that sets a 
new bar for future animators.

“Loving 
Vincent”

Good Deed 

Entertainment

Michigan Theater

The 
crowd 
shuffled 

excitedly in, only slowed by the 
long lines for craft beer being 
sold in the lobby.

Laith Al-Saadi rocked out 

last Friday night to a packed 
Michigan Theater full of old 
friends. The audience was 
comprised of people who both 
love the music Al-Saadi plays 
and the man himself. He’s a 
hometown classic.

“We took him for granted 

when 
he 
was 
playing 
on 

Main Street” said the host 
of Ann Arbor’s 107.1 radio 
station, introducing Al-Saadi. 
Then he led the audience in 
singing 
“Happy 
Birthday” 

and welcomed Al-Saadi to the 
stage, followed by an uproar of 
applause and hooting from the 
audience.

The lights were black out, 

but he struck a double peace 
signs pose anyway, which led 
to the crowd erupting into a 
craze again. The stage was 
thick with fog as the rest of the 
band walked on. There were 
two drum sets, a keyboard / 
synthesizer setup and seven 
guitars on the stage. Al-Saadi 
picked up one of them and took 
a moment to tune.

Then, still in darkness, Laith 

struck a chord and began to 
riff up and down the guitar — 
the first of many riffs that he 
played throughout the night. 
Al-Saadi gave the signal and 
the lights burst on while the 
rest of the band erupted into 
“Breathe” from his album A 
Long Time Coming.

After the first song, Al-Saadi 

addressed the crowd for the 
first time. He mentioned how 
special the Michigan Theater 
is to him, and he recalled that 
his first professional theatre 
gig as a Lost Boy in “Peter Pan” 
took place at that venue.

“And I got paid, dammit” 

he said. The crowd burst into 
laughter.

Ann Arbor is his home turf. 

These people were with him 
before “The Voice,” before he 
was playing in cities all across 
the country and the world.

“Happy Birthday!” shouted a 

voice from the crowd.

“Thank 
you!” 
Al-Saadi 

responded. “The big 4-0!”

Up 
next 
was 
a 
classic: 

“Ophelia” by The Band. Al Hill, 
Al-Saadi’s guest keyboardist 
for the night, showed his 
award-winning talent on the 
synth and keyboard with a 
syncopated and jazzy solo in 
the middle of the song.

As the first set of songs 

continued, they played more 
of Al-Saadi’s original work 
including 
“If,” 
“The 
Last 

Time You’ll See Me Cry,” and 
“Gone.” That last song was a 
crowd favorite.

“Sing it with me!” Al-Saadi 

said while leading the crowd 
into a slow clap on the beat. 
The crowd was eager to join in 
on such a catchy chorus: “Gone 
gone, babe I’m gone / Oh Lord 
got to keep moving on / I’m so 
tired of waiting so long / Babe 
I’m gone gone gone.”

During the last time the 

chorus came around, Al-Saadi 
stepped 
away 
from 
the 

microphone and leaned his 
head back to add a harmony 
line. His booming voice easily 
carried over the entire theater 
of singing voices, even without 
a 
microphone. 
The 
crowd 

erupted into applause when 
that one ended.

“We’ve lost so many greats 

lately,” 
Al-Saadi 
said. 
“I 

couldn’t leave you without 
a tribute to Tom Petty.” The 
crowd erupted into excited 
applause.

As he started to riff on 

the guitar to introduce the 
song, he slips in the melody 
from the song “Maria” from 
the Broadway musical “West 
Side Story” — the iconic line 
“say it loud and there’s music 
playing.” This is something 
Al-Saadi loves to do: He often 
throws in recognizable and 
famous lines from different 
songs in the middle of his 
guitar riffs just to tease the 
audience, but then switches 
back to the original song.

He then continued into Tom 

Petty’s famous song “Runnin’ 
Down A Dream.” The crowd 
bobbed their heads and sang 
along with the band the whole 
way through. Al-Saadi turned 
this four minute song into an 
epic journey of guitar riffs and 
powerful 
instrumentation. 

He masterfully milked every 
special moment that the song 
gives, extending it out to over 
10 minutes. Just when you 
thought the song was about to 
finish, he broke into another 
guitar riff, each more intricate 
and 
exciting 
as 
the 
last. 

This wasn’t a cover; it was a 
masterpiece.

The crowd was up on their 

feet, hooting and hollering for 
a long time after he left the 
stage, but it was just the end of 
the first half.

As the lights came on for 

intermission and the crowd 
shuffled into the lobby to grab 
a second round of beers, the 
chatter started up. Various 
concert goers remark on how 
long it has been since they last 
saw Al-Saadi, or talk about 
how long they have lived in 
Ann Arbor. These are the 
people 
who 
are 
Al-Saadi’s 

truest supporters. These are 
the people that he was playing 
for that night.

The lights faded out and in, 

the second half was about to 
begin.

The band took the stage 

while Al-Saadi introduced the 
funky METERS’s Brian Stoltz 
from Louisiana, a long-time 
friend and fellow guitarist.

The duo picked up guitars 

and got right to it. They played 
back and forth while facing 
each 
other. 
They 
weren’t 

having a guitar battle, but it 
was more of a conversation 
— 
each 
side 
masterfully 

adding new ideas to the song’s 
progression.

The 
second 
half 
didn’t 

have as many stops between 
songs. Between most of them 
was a just smooth transition. 
Al-Saadi and the band played 
some more originals from his 
albums 
“Real.” 
and 
“Long 

Time Coming.” He also played 
crowd favorites like “Midnight 
Rider” by The Allman Brothers 
Band and “Stella Blue” by 
Grateful Dead.

The last original song that 

Al-Saadi played was “Who 
Turned 
Out 
The 
Lights?” 

which is a hard-hitting song 
with powerful lyrics. With 
minutes left in the set, Al-Saadi 
announced that the next song 
would be the last for the night, 
one that he performed during 
the finals of “The Voice.”

As the band started to play 

the iconic opening to “All 
Along The Watchtower” by 
Jimi Hendrix, Al-Saadi used 
the last few moments with the 
audience: “Thank you, Ann 
Arbor. I love you from the 
bottom of my heart. Thank you 
for supporting me.”

The crowd was up on their 

feet cheering. This time the 
guitars battled, Laith ripped 
into his powerful vocal growl 
as the crowd sang and raised 
fists in the air throughout the 
whole song.

Then it was over and the 

lights cut out, except for a 
spotlight on Al-Saadi.

“Peace and Love, ya’ll.”
Al-Saadi is the real deal: 

He’s a showman, he’s got real 
talent, he’s his own artist, he’s 
an incredible guitarist, he can 
work a crowd, he can sing. But 
above all, he’s a joy to watch 
perform live. He has a smile on 
his face throughout it all, and 
anyone who watches him can 
tell that he feels unbridled joy 
when he shares the music he 
loves.

“Thank you so much.”
It was a perfect concert. 

He left nothing unsung. He 
thanked 
the 
band, 
calling 

each member by name. He 
then addressed his hometown 
crowd, 
in 
his 
hometown 

theater, one last time for the 
night.

“See you soon.”

A pot of gumbo and an identity

“

A Coach Beilein team 
is like a good pot of 
gumbo.”

Gumbo has a multitude 

of ingredients. It is often 
greater than the sum of 
its parts. It takes time and 
patience.

Assistant 

coach Saddi 
Washington 
certainly 
believes the 
same will 
apply to 
this year’s 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team.

“You put 

the ingredients together and 
just let them stew. By the 
time you get midway through 
the season you’ve got a very 
good meal.”

If player development 

in college basketball was 
a perfectly linear process, 
Kameron Chatman would 
be readying himself to lead 
this team. D.J. Wilson would 
be coming into his own as 
the versatile stretch-four 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
has always envisioned. 
Aubrey Dawkins would be 
vital for Beilein’s trademark 
spacing as a dead-eye shooter. 
With any luck, Ricky Doyle 
would be providing consistent 
minutes as a useful third big. 

For one reason or another, 

they’re all gone. Who 
remains?

A two-star 

senior who 
has never been 
more than a 
complimentary 
offensive 
option, a 
lanky German 
whose plea to 
the NBA went 
unanswered, 
a graduate 
transfer from 
Ohio (University, not State), 
the rare Kentucky five-star 
who failed to go one-and-
done, a transfer from Division 
III Williams College, 
an unproven sophomore 
point guard and a group of 
freshmen.

And every single one of 

them will have to play a major 
role for this team.

“The attitude has been 

good by everybody on the 
team,” Beilein said. “We’re 
just trying to get better, but 
we’re not very good right 

now.”

Individually, 

they bring the 
history of their 
incongruent 
pasts. Together, 
they paint a 
picture that 
remains wholly 
unclear. 

For a team that 

was mere inches 
from an Elite 

Eight berth a season ago, 
expectations are relatively 
low. Neither the coaches’ 
poll nor the AP top 25 listed 
Michigan. The 32-player 
USBWA preseason watch 
list for the Oscar Robertson 
Award was released Monday. 
There were no Wolverines. 

And that lack of expectations 
may have less to do with 
talent than sheer uncertainty.

It’s a team sandwiched 

between the graduation of 
two highly-accomplished, 
four-year mainstays and an 
incoming recruiting class 
brimming with potential. 
Down the line, this pieced-
together crew may leave no 
trace in the memories of fans.

But maybe — just maybe — 

it will.

Lack of experience and lack 

of talent are two different 
problems. The former may be 
true, the latter certainly is 
not. Above all, this team is 
devoid of certainty.

But it isn’t devoid of 

motivation. Nearly everyone 
who steps on the court for 
Michigan this year will have 
a desire to prove somebody, 
somewhere wrong.

Nobody will mistake this 

team for the “white collar” 
reputation that has long 

lingered around the program.

“We all have a chip on 

our shoulders for multiple 
reasons, everybody’s reason 
is different,” said senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman. “But I think that’s 
because in 
games, and 
things like that 
going against 
guys who were 
projected as 
five-stars, and 
going out there 
and showing 
them that 
we’re just as 
good as you, 
that stars don’t 
matter.”

Added Beilein: “This is 

the most competitive our 
practices have ever been 
since I’ve been here, because 
there’s enough grit. We’ve 
had quickness, we’ve had 
talent, sometimes we’re 
missing some of that grit to 

compete. We’ve got some 
competition going on right 
now that’s really healthy for 
us.”

That, in and of itself, is an 

identity.

Call them a group of 

misfits, expect 
them to struggle 
after several 
key departures, 
question the 
professional 
viability of them 
all, wonder 
how well they 
fit together as 
a team. To an 
extent, it’s all 
rooted in truth.

But the ingredients are in 

the pot. Beilein is still the 
chef. 

Now let’s see if this gumbo 

will sizzle.

In the spotlight: Moritz Wagner

Things are different now for 

Moritz Wagner.

As 
he 
walks 
through 
the 

University of Michigan’s campus, 
students pass. Some call him 
“Mo,” and wish him luck in his 
upcoming games for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team.

This 
phenomenon 
came 
as 

a surprise to Wagner’s father, 
Axel Schulz, when he came from 
Germany to visit a few weeks ago. 
Sure, he was aware of his son’s 
success; he just didn’t realize 
quite how popular he’d gotten.

Wagner admits it even surprises 

him sometimes. At 6-foot-11, he’s 
always stood out. But since last 
season, since going to the NBA 
Combine, things have changed 
for the junior forward.

When he makes one of his 

frequent trips to Chipotle, people 
approach him. It’s taught Wagner 
to always be conscious of what 
he’s saying and doing. Make no 
mistake, though, he enjoys the 
attention.

“I want to tell them, I just 

play basketball,” Wagner said. “I 
played basketball my freshman 
year, too.”

But the present is a far cry 

from his arrival in Ann Arbor. 
Back 
then, 
the 
recognition, 

the confidence and the success 
Wagner now enjoys were absent. 
Wagner 
was 
a 
raw, 
foreign 

product still trying to find his 
place. The spotlight had yet to 
shine on him.

In the matter of 

a few seasons, that 
would all change.

***

When 
Wagner 

came to Michigan, 
he was adapting 
to an entirely new 
culture. He could 
speak English, but 
it was clearly his 
second 
language. 

He’d tell people he was going to 
“brush his tooth,” and certain 
basketball terminology needed to 
be explained to him.

“This is probably bad for me 

to say, but I was always just 
frustrated to be around him, 
because it was just so aggravating 
just to talk to him, really,” said 
former Michigan guard Andrew 
Dakich. “And it’s not his fault at 

all, it’s more of me being patient 
with him.”

And no one needed to be more 

patient than Brent Hibbitts.

Wagner’s 
freshman 
year 

roommate, Hibbitts committed 
after Wagner, and since they 
were the only two players in their 
class, it was immediately clear 
that the two would be living 
together.

Hibbitts said he was 

nervous 
about 
that 

prospect. He didn’t 
know 
what 
to 

expect of somebody 
from 
a 
different 

culture, so when 
the pair moved in 
the summer before 
their 
freshman 

year, 
he 
was 

surprised by some 
things.

For 
one, 
he 

said, Germans are 
firm 
believers 

in 
conserving 

energy, and many 
of them don’t use 
air 
conditioning 

or 
fans. 
Wagner 

was used to silence 
when he slept. So 
despite 
Hibbitts’ 

preference for a cool 
bedroom, they turned 
off their air conditioning 
at night so Wagner could 
sleep.

Wagner 
adapted 

quickly, 
though. 

Throughout the summer, 

his lexicon 
expanded, 
picking up 
basketball 
terms and 
even some 
slang.

Yet, for 

all 
the 

progress 
Wagner 
had 
made 

off 
the 

court, there was still 
plenty of work to do 
on it. He had played 
a lot of basketball in 
Germany, but this was 
a new level and style. 
Wagner 
was 
skinny, 

and because his body 
wasn’t 
college-ready, 

he 
didn’t 
have 
the 

confidence to excel. It 

showed 
on 
the 

court.

“A 
lot 

of it was 
because 
of 
his 

body,” 

Hibbitts 

said. 
“I 

wouldn’t 
say 
he 
was 

physically ready 
to 
play 
college 

basketball, so he 
couldn’t 
really 

show 
his 
talents, 

because 
his 
body 

was so far behind. 

That kind of discouraged him and 
made him question himself.”

Added Wagner: “At the end 

of the day, if you trust your 
body, that’s really all it comes 
down to. … That’s what a lot of 
freshmen 
don’t 

have at a young 
age, 
especially 

me, 
being 
210 

or whatever I 

was.”

With 

Ricky 
Doyle and 
Mark 
Donnal 
in front 
of 
him 

on the depth chart, 
Wagner’s 
minutes 

were fleeting — he 
averaged 
8.6 
per 

game 
with 
2.9 

points 
and 
1.8 

rebounds. 

Nonetheless, 

the Wolverines 
snuck into the 
2016 
NCAA 

Tournament as 
one of the last 
four 
teams, 

drawing 
Tulsa 

in 
the 
first 

round.

Early 
in 
the 

game, 
Doyle 
and 

Donnal got in foul 
trouble. 
Wagner’s 

number 
was 

called, 
and 
he 

took 
advantage, 

finishing 
with 

four points, eight 
rebounds 
and 

four blocks over 
22 minutes in a 
67-62 
win. 
He 

followed that up 
by 
scoring 
six 

points in eight 
minutes against 
Notre Dame in 
the next round.

They 
were 
small 

numbers, but important 
improvements.

“He started playing 

really well for us at the 
end of his freshman 
year,” Dakich said. “If 
you look at the game 
against 
Tulsa 
and 

Notre Dame when he 
was playing a lot more 
minutes, just because 

of that energy and how he was 
finishing around the rim. … And 
his confidence just kind of grew.”

It was a strong finish to the 

season, but more importantly, 
Wagner now knew what he had to 

improve on. And that 
spotlight on him was 
about to get much, 
much brighter.

***

When 
Wagner 

signed on to play 
at Michigan, there 
were 
no 
available 

scholarships. 
It 

wasn’t until then-
senior Max Bielfeldt 
transferred 
to 

Indiana that a roster spot opened 
up.

But 
the 
Wolverines 
were 

without a senior for the 2015-
16 season, and Wagner was still 
looking up at Doyle and Donnal. 
That, too, changed quickly.

Doyle transferred to Florida 

Gulf Coast, opening up valuable 
minutes in a depleted Michigan 
frontcourt. And on the heels of 
his strong finish, Wagner saw an 
opportunity to seize playing time.

So he went to work. He gained 

15 pounds working with strength 
and 
conditioning 
coach 
Jon 

Sanderson, and with that came a 
renewed mindset.

“I love these guys. Seeing Ricky 

leave like that, I hope he has a 
great season in Florida,” Wagner 
said. “… After my freshman year, 
there was, like, kind of a time 
where I saw, ‘Okay, this is my 
time. Now I’m ready physically, 
and especially mentally.’ And I 
kind of embraced it.”

From there, Wagner had to 

prove himself on the court. He 
cracked the starting lineup in 
the first game, but things weren’t 
always great for him at the start 
of the season. Wagner showed 
flashes, though. He had his first 
20-point game against Kennesaw 
State on Dec. 3 and his first 
double-double in a blowout over 
Indiana on Jan. 26.

What Wagner struggled with 

was consistency. Interspersed in 
his double-digit scoring nights 
were losses against Illinois and 
Ohio State, when he had just six 
and five points, respectively.

Yet, through the ups and downs, 

Wagner was becoming a fan 
favorite. His natural charisma, 
which he says comes from his

dad, has a tendency to show 
itself on the basketball court. He 
pounded his chest and stuck out 
his tongue after big plays. After 
big scoring outputs in games 
against Purdue and Wisconsin, 
his fans were hooked.

“One of my former coaches 

in Germany told me once that 
he thinks I see the basketball 
court as a stage,” Wagner said. 
“That kind of sums it up pretty 
nicely. I really enjoy that type 
of spotlight. I think it’s just my 
thing.”

That increased 

tenfold 
in 
the 

postseason. 
After 
a 
miracle 

run to the Big 
Ten Tournament 
Championship 
and 
a 
shootout 

victory 
over 

Oklahoma 
State 

in the first round 
of 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament, 
the 
Wolverines 

ran into their toughest test: No. 
2-seed Louisville. The Cardinals’ 
size figured to be a problem for 
Wagner, who had struggled on 
defense at times.

But Wagner exploded again. 

He led his team with 26 points, 
further cementing himself as a 
force for Michigan.

Fans weren’t the only ones 

who took notice. Suddenly, NBA 
scouts were watching, and at the 
end of the season, Wagner was 
invited to the NBA Combine. 
Thanks to new rules, he was 

allowed to work out for NBA 
teams and still be eligible to 
return to school.

Right up until the decision 

deadline, Wagner was on the 
fence.

“Even the day he made his 

decision, people had no idea, even 
us close to him,” Hibbitts said. 
“Unless he told us personally, we 
had no idea.”

Added Wagner: “I talked to 

a lot of people, but I kept the 
inner circle as small as possible, 

just because it’s my 
decision.”

Ultimately, 

Wagner 
decided 

to come back for 
one 
more 
year. 

The criticisms he 
received from NBA 
scouts were similar 
to the ones he’d been 
getting all season. 
He 
was 
told 
he 

needed to improve 

his rebounding, his defense, his 
strength and explosiveness. Even 
Wagner admits “it isn’t really big 
news.”

So back to work he went. He 

had been given advice on specific 
skills to improve, but Wagner 
didn’t let that faze him. He was 
more focused on improving his 
game in every facet.

“I hate when people come 

and say, ‘I worked on this all 
summer,’ ” Wagner said. “Like, 
no you’re not, because you’re 
going to shoot too. I always want 
to improve in everything. So, yes, 

I have those things in mind, but 
I know about that type of stuff. 
I just work out like I always do, 
and I focus on certain things, but 
it’s not a huge deal.”

Something 
else 
changed, 

though. There was more attrition 
coming, 
and 
the 
spotlight’s 

intensity was about to increase.

***

Wagner didn’t go to the NBA 

Combine alone. Forward D.J. 
Wilson went too. The difference 
was 
that 
Wilson’s 
feedback 

was positive enough for him to 
make the decision to enter the 
NBA Draft. He was taken by the 
Milwaukee Bucks with the 17th 
pick. Add that to the graduation 
of forward Zak Irvin and guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., and Wagner 
is one of the most experienced 
returning 
players 
for 
the 

Wolverines.

Not 
only 
does 
that 
mean 

heightened 
expectations 
from 

people on the outside, but it 
means he’s expected to take on a 

leadership role on the team, too.

“Now I’ve seen a couple of 

things,” Wagner said. “I’ve been 
to two NCAA Tournaments, and 
I’m one of the more experienced 
guys on the team. I think people 
listen to me and trust me too, just 
as much as I trust them. I think 
I’m one of the vocal guys that 
has to step up his leadership. 
Last year, I was a leader, too. But 
when I made a mistake, it kind 
of slipped under the table a little 
bit. This year, if I make a mistake 
I get held accountable for it, 
because I am one of the leaders.”

Wagner 
still 
has 
all 
his 

aspirations 
in 
front 
of 
him. 

The NBA will still be there 
next season, and his dream of 
opening a Chipotle in Germany 
is attainable from there. But for 
now, he will focus on the little 
things that will get him to that 
point.

That means slightly shifting the 

emotions that have made Wagner 
so beloved — he says he wants 
to cut down on complaining, not 
just on the basketball court, but 
in his entire life.

It 
means 
continuing 
to 

improve his body to make him 
more successful and continuing 
to develop the skills that have 
gotten him this far.

But Wagner is no stranger to 

adapting to change. He did it as 
a freshman, taking the leap to a 
foreign country to play college 
basketball.

He did it as a sophomore, 

thriving 
in 
a 
role 
no 
one 

anticipated he’d have.

Now, the man who calls the 

court his stage is ready to begin 
his third act.

The spotlight is brighter than 

ever. That’s just the way Wagner 
likes it. 

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Junior forward Moritz Wagner has always thought of the basketball court as his stage, and now he has a bigger spotlight than ever to put on a performance for Michigan.

Roster breakdown: Wolverines have 
numerous questions marks this year 

Personnel wise, it’s the start 

of a new era for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team. 

Gone are yesteryear’s faces of 

the program – Derrick Walton 
Jr. and Zak Irvin – who were 
fixtures 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

lineup since the start of their 
freshman season.

Also absent are D.J. Wilson 

– now a Milwaukee Buck after 
a breakout season at Michigan 
– Mark Donnal and Andrew 
Dakich, 
who 
transferred 

to Clemson and Ohio State, 
respectively.

But 
the 
Wolverines 
do 

return two starters from the 
last year’s Sweet 16 squad in 
senior guard Muhammed-Ali 
Abdul-Rahkman 
and 
junior 

center Moritz Wagner, along 
with fifth-year senior forward 

Duncan Robinson.

A capable sophomore class 

comprised of guards Zavier 
Simpson and Ibi Watson, as well 
as center Jon Teske will help 
to help fill those losses. Three 
freshmen – all former four-star 
recruits – could see playing 
time, too.

Also 
new 
to 
Michigan’s 

roster 
are 
Ohio 
graduate 

transfer Jaaron Simmons and 
former Kentucky small forward 
Charles Matthews. Both are 
talented but have yet to prove it 
at the highest levels of college 
basketball.

As the Wolverines look to 

make 
another 
deep 
run 
in 

March, the Daily breaks down 
this year’s roster:

Point Guards:
Right now, this is Michigan’s 

murkiest position with Simpson, 
Simmons 
and 
freshman 
Eli 

Brooks all figuring to play 

– but with unclear minute 
distributions.

Simpson is the lone returner 

and 
started 
last 
Friday’s 

exhibition win against Grand 
Valley State. The Ohio native is 
a strong defender and rebounder 
and 
seems 
more 
confident 

offensively this fall. Though 
Simpson doesn’t have much 
collegiate game experience – he 
averaged just 8.7 minutes last 
season – Simpson knows John 
Beilein’s system, giving him the 
early upper hand in the point 
guard competition.

Despite his current backup 

role, meanwhile, Simmons might 
be the most talented scorer on 
Michigan’s roster. In his final 
year at Ohio, he averaged 15.9 
points and 6.5 assists a contest, 
excelling as a pull-up shooter 
and slasher. Given sufficient 
time to completely learn the 
Wolverines’ offense, Simmons 

could be the starter sooner 
rather than later.

Finally, Brooks will likely 

come off Beilein’s bench to play 
both point and shooting guard. 
Against Grand Valley State, 
Brooks provided a scoring spark 
to 
Michigan’s 
second 
team, 

adding five points and an assist 
in 15 minutes of action.

Shooting Guards:
Muhammed-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman will start here every 
game this season, barring injury. 
The former two-star recruit 
has flowered into a reliable 
offensive threat, averaging 9.1 
points per game on 46 percent 
shooting last year. He’s a capable 
shooter and defender, but, more 
importantly, he’s the heart and 
soul of this Michigan team. 
With the most career minutes 
played, Abdur-Rahkman looks 
primed to be announced as a 
captain.

Behind him are Ibi Watson 

and freshman Jordan Poole. 
Despite limited playing time 
a year ago, Watson looked 
confident against Grand Valley 
State, sinking a three and mid-
ranger jumper seconds after 
he entered the game. If he 
can do the same during the 
regular season, Watson could 
be a fixture in the Wolverines’ 
second team.

On the contrary, if Friday 

was any indication, Poole could 
miss Beilein’s regular rotation. 
The former four-star recruit 
saw just two minutes of action 
on Friday, and those came 
minutes 
after 
walk-ons 
had 

been unloaded from the bench. 
Brooks’ emergence also hurts 
Poole’s prospects of playing 
significant minutes – at least to 
begin the year.

Forwards:
Unlike 
at 
point 
guard, 

Michigan’s forwards are not 
marked by the question of who 
plays when. Instead, Charles 
Matthews, Duncan Robinson 
and freshman Isaiah Livers will 
receive nearly all the minutes 
at the ‘3’ and ‘4’ spots. But 
the efficacy of each is still a 
mystery.

Matthews 
was 
the 

Wolverines’ 
best 
player 

throughout 
the 
exhibition, 

combining a mid-range touch 
with 
strength 
in 
transition 

for 23 points. At 6-foot-6 and 
200 pounds, Matthews is also 
Michigan’s most athletic player, 
and it shows on the defensive 
end – he’ll frequently be tasked 
with guarding the opposition’s 
best 
player. 
But 
Matthews 

is still an unproven 3-point 
shooter, which could present 
complications 
in 
Beilein’s 

outside-oriented offense. Last 
Friday provided some clarity 
in Matthews’ development in 
that area, however, as he sunk a 
corner three for the game’s first 
points. 

Robinson, meanwhile, is a 

classic stretch-four. Despite a 
slight decrease in minutes and 
points per game last season 
thanks to Wilson’s emergence,

Big Ten breakdown: Michigan 
State sits atop the leaderboard 

Smash Mouth told the world 

“all that glitters is gold” in their 
hit song “All Star.”

Big Ten men’s basketball 

would beg to differ.

Despite the allure of being 

a Power Five conference with 
four teams in the AP preseason 
Top 25 poll, a litter of Big Ten 
teams lack identities as they 
seek to replace the stars of last 
year with the unproven pieces 
of today.

Michigan, of course, is no 

exception. With the departures 
of Derrick Walton Jr., Zak 
Irvin and DJ Wilson, serious 
questions 
have 
emerged 

regarding 
the 
Wolverines’ 

depth 
chart. 
Eight 
new 

faces — including three new 
starters 
alongside 
junior 

forward Moritz Wagner and 
senior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman — will see 
an unfamiliar amount of game 

time at the college level. A spot 
in the NCAA Tournament is 
far from a lock for Michigan in 
2017-18.

Whether 
it 
be 
a 
lack 

of chemistry or a lack of 
meaningful 
experience, 
the 

Wolverines are only one of many 
involved 
in 
the 
conference 

quagmire. The Daily breaks 
down the best of the Michigan’s 
competition this season:

No. 2 Michigan State
There’s one name to know 

here: Miles Bridges. 

The 
sophomore 
star’s 

decision to return to school 
surprised everyone but himself. 
Bridges — who averaged 16.9 
points and 8.3 rebounds per 
game last season — has made 
two of his collegiate goals 
clear for this year: a National 
Championship 
and 
the 

Naismith Award. The additions 
of graduate transfer Ben Carter 
and two highly-touted recruits 
in Jaren Jackson and Xavier 
Tillman make both of those 

objectives seem well within 
reach.

Even 
without 
the 
added 

starpower, Tom Izzo’s team — 
with another year of experience 
under 
its 
belt 
— 
appears 

primed to easily surpass its 
unimpressive 20-15 record in 
2016-17. If Cassius Winston and 
Nick Ward can stay healthy at 
the ‘1’ and the ‘5,’ the Spartans 
can be lethal.

Like many of its conference 

counterparts, though, most of 
Michigan State’s lineup has only 
one year of, if any, experience 
playing college basketball. But 
if the Spartans find chemistry 
early on, good luck to the rest of 
the Big Ten.

No. 15 Minnesota
The injury bug hit the Golden 

Gophers early with the loss of 
their sixth man, Eric Curry. 
The backup big man often saw 
upwards of 20 minutes on the 
court, averaging 5.5 points and 
5.2 boards per game. Due to this 
loss in the frontcourt, coach 
Richard 
Pitino 
emphasized 

the extra impact needed from 
Texas A&M transfer Davonte 
Fitzgerald, who has battled 
injuries in the past and saw 
limited action for the Aggies. 
Center Bakary Konate has been 
a serviceable frontcourt option, 
but not much more than that.

Nonetheless, 
Minnesota 

features one of the most talented 
backcourts 
in 
the 
country. 

All-Big Ten first teamer Nate 
Mason leads the way, averaging 
15.2 points and 5.0 assists in 
nearly 35 minutes a contest 
as the Golden Gophers’ floor 
general last season. Shooting 
guard 
Amir 
Coffey 
trailed 

slightly behind at 33.2 minutes 
per game and is also regarded 
as one of the conferences’ 
premiere 
returning 
scoring 

threats.

In the absence of Curry, 

Reggie 
Lynch 
and 
Jordan 

Murphy may also see more 
playing time down low. But 
more time for the tandem 
of glass-crashing big men is 
nothing for Pitino to hang his 
head about.

Evanston,

a 

makeover, but the Wildcats’

Michigan coach John Beilein will lead a new era of Wolverine basketball in 2017-18, as the roster now has eight newcomers on the court and two on the sideline.

Robinson was still effective 

outside, 
shooting 
over 
42 

percent from three. Robinson 
is undersized, though, causing 
him some occasional defensive 
struggles.

Livers is a mix of the two, 

combining size with a capable 
jumper. As he did Friday, 
the 
former 
Michigan 
Mr. 

Basketball will see action in a 
back up capacity to start the 
year.

Centers:
With all the Wolverines’ 

departures, 
Moritz 
Wagner 

becomes the most important 
player on Michigan’s roster. 
As a skilled center with the 
ability to handle the ball and 
shoot, he’s the Wolverines’ 
go-to option offensively. One 
could even make the case that 
Michigan 
goes 
as 
Wagner 

does. That was evident against 
Louisville 
in 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament last March, when 
Wagner scored 26 points on 
11-of-14 shooting en route to a 
Wolverine victory.

Unlike last season, however, 

Wagner will have a target on 

his back now – something 
that 
he 
and 
Beilein 
have 

acknowledged. As a highly 
emotional 
player, 
Wagner 

needs to remain level-headed 
to stay on the floor and avoid 
foul trouble.

Possible 
weaknesses 
for 

Michigan’s front court could 
come defensively and on the 
glass, as Wagner and Robinson 
create 
an 
undersized 
duo. 

Friday wasn’t a strong start, as 
Michigan allowed 15 offensive 
rebounds to a small Lakers 
lineup. 

Filling 
out 
the 
rotation 

are Jon Teske and redshirt 
freshman Austin Davis. Teske 
played just 3.1 minutes per 
game a season ago, but Beilein 
has 
been 
impressed 
with 

the strides Teske has made 
offensively. These strides were 
apparent on Friday, as Teske 
saw 12 minutes of action – 
compared to Davis’ six – and 
added two field goals and three 
assists.

Though clearly the third-

string big man, Davis has 
strength and size and might 
be forced to eat minutes this 
season when Wagner and Teske 
find foul trouble.

lineup 
is 
barely 
changing. 

Northwestern — which will 
instead play at Allstate Arena 
16 miles from campus in 2017-
18 — lost just two players to 
graduation, and has adequate 
replacements in top-150 recruit 
Anthony Gaines and Boston 
College transfer A.J. Turner.

Turner 
and 
Gaines 
join 

a Wildcats team that made 
program history with their first 
NCAA Tournament appearance. 
This year, they will be expected 
to return.

Senior 
guard 
Bryant 

McIntosh 
returns 
as 
the 

torchbearer after posting 14.8 
points and a conference-leading 
5.2 assists per game. McIntosh’s 
sidekick in the backcourt is 
Scottie Lindsey, who emerged 
as a knockdown shooting threat 
in his first year as a starter. The 
two comprise one of the most 
potent offensive combinations 
in the country.

The Wolverine faithful would 

surely like to get forward Dererk 
Pardon out of their memories. 
Against 
Michigan, 
Pardon 

caught a full-court inbounds 
pass for an easy layup as time 
expired to give Northwestern 
its first winning season in the 
conference since 1968. The goal 
has changed now — for 2017-18, 
it’s about winning the Big Ten 
for the Wildcats.

No. 20 Purdue
The Boilermakers got an early 

start to their season, playing 
as Team USA for the World 
University Games and finishing 
in second place after an 85-74 
loss to Lithuania in the finals.

Purdue will have to play 

catch-up, though, as it faces 
perhaps the toughest challenge 
in the conference: replacing 
Caleb Swanigan. While much 
of the Boilermakers’ foundation 
remains the same, Swanigan 
led the Big Ten in rebounding 
and was second in scoring 
— 
production 
that 
7-foot-2 

center Isaac Haas simply can’t 
replicate. Haas calls himself the 

best center in the conference, 
though he’ll have to prove that 
statement on the court.

Outside 
the 
arc, 
Vince 

Edwards and Dakota Mathias 
return as two of the best 3-point 
shooting talents in the Big Ten. 
Swanigan’s 
departure 
will 

certainly hurt Purdue’s 79.7 
point-per-game average, but the 
pieces are in place for one of the 
conference’s most experienced 
teams to continue to have an 
elite offense.

Wisconsin (14 votes)
It’s Ethan Happ and then 

everyone else in Madison this 
season. 
The 
unrecognizable 

Badgers — who are now without 
Zak Showalter, Nigel Hayes, 
Bronson Koenig and Vitto Brown 
— are the team most likely to fall 
after a second-place conference 
finish in 2016-17. Happ put up an 
impressive 14 points per game in 
addition to being the Big Ten 
Defensive Player of the Year, 
but Wisconsin will need one of 
its four high-ranked recruits or 
last year’s role players to step 
up to continue to be a college 

basketball powerhouse.

The player most prepared to 

do that is D’Mitrik Trice. For 
Trice, however, an expected 
increase in production is more 
of a necessity than an option. 
The sophomore point guard was 
the Badgers’ most reliable bench 
player last year, despite a quiet 
5.6 points per game. Happ is 
the unmistakable leader for this 
team, but Trice could be relied 
upon as an emerging offensive 
playmaker to replace Showalter 
and Koenig’s production.

Wisconsin 
hasn’t 
missed 

the tournament since 1999, the 
sixth-longest streak in NCAA 
history. 
Seeing 
that 
streak 

come to an end could be a real 
possibility this season.

Maryland (seven votes)
The Terrapins will be on 

the same learning curve as 
Purdue, as they too have lost 
their unquestioned leader in 
point 
guard 
Melo 
Trimble. 

Maryland 
doesn’t 
have 
the 

same experienced core as the 
Boilermakers, but does have a 
trio of sophomores who could 

take the next step and keep 
the Terrapins in the spotlight: 
Justin Jackson, Kevin Huerter 
and Anthony Cowan.

Jackson’s freshman campaign 

was 
a 
welcome 
sight 
for 

Maryland; his name was even in 
the conversation before the NBA 
Draft. But the 6-foot-7 small 
forward is back, and was named 
a preseason All-Big Ten and 
Julius Erving Award Watch List 
selection. Huerter and Cowan’s 
impacts were not as pronounced 
in their first years, but they did 
not exhibit glaring flaws in any 
facets of their game.

The Terrapins perhaps have 

the most interesting newcomer 
in the conference in Bruno 
Fernando. The Angolan center 
introduces a unique blend of 
size and athleticism that could 
position him as a threat to 
Jaren Jackson’s push for Big 
Ten Freshman of the Year. 
Maryland’s 
frontcourt 
depth 

appears to be its weakest link, 
but the speed of Fernando’s 
adjustment to college ball could 
change that.

The Michigan men’s basketball team will face a tough challenge in conference play this year, as there are four Big Ten teams in the AP preseason top 25 poll and the Wolverines aren’t one of them.
