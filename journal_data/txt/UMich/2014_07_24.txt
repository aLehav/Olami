University names new Trotter
Multicultural Center director

My month spent studying abroad in
northern Ghana was most definitely a
transformative experience. I came away
with a new understanding of heat, an
obsession with mangos and a deep love for
a culture that emphasizes kindness above
all else. However, it would be remiss of me
to display these photos without recogniz-
ing the slew of political issues that come
with photographing people, and especially
children, abroad.
My fellow students and I had daily dis-
cussions about how uncomfortable we
felt in certain situations, as a group of
anthropology and African studies majors
are bound to do. Our professor, from a dif-
ferent era and with less sensitivity to the
political effect a group of Americans can
have abroad, placed us in many situations

where we felt extremely uneasy. Once, our
plans suddenly changed from visiting a
school on a weekend with a few donations,
to interrupting classes in the middle of a
busy school day with immense fanfare. I
was forced to confront my discomfort and
the political and historical context of my
skin color.
But this is a photo story about northern
Ghana, not a space for my personal reflec-
tions. I should explain that these children
repeatedly asked me to "snap" their photo.
So Idid, they laughed atthemselves frozen
on my camera screen, and I taught them
how to "snap" me.
This is who I met. These are the photos
I brought back.

Appointment
reflects renewed
effort to address
student programs
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Editor in Chief
In response to student input on
campus diversity issues from the
Winter 2014 semester, the Uni-
versity appointed the now-for-
mer director of the University's
Spectrum Center Jackie Simpson
as the new director for the Trot-
ter Multicultural Center Monday.
Simpson will focus on improv-
ing programming alongside
ongoing efforts to improve the
physical space for the upcoming
academic year. In an additional

appointment, Trey Boynton, cur-
rently director of diversity and
inclusion in University Hous-
ing, will be appointed director of
MESA in August. Prior to these
appointments, one director, Nina
Grant, oversaw both organiza-
tions.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily Tuesday, E.
Royster Harper, vice president
for student life, praised the two
new appointees for their dedica-
tion to improving student life on
campus and willingness to work
with students during their time
at the University.
"What I'm trying to do is have
two really strong leaders in those
areas, as we rethink how we
engage most students," Harper
said.
The announcement follows the
University's pledge in January to

allocate $300,000 to the Trotter
Center's facility renovations, fol-
lowing a protest by members of
the Black Student Union.
In a Wednesday interview,
Simpson said she was just begin-
ning the process of learning
about the renovation projects
already underway. She also noted
that, while the building was cer-
tainly in need of repairs, it was
still beautiful and a great space
for students to meet.
Simpson added that she has
already begun meeting with
campus groups such as the BSU,
which is one of nine student
organizations that currently hold
office hours in the Trotter Cen-
ter.
BSU vice chair Geralyn Gaines
said her organization was opti-
mistic about the appointment

Arts Alliance
highlights lack of
institutional support
for creative sector
By SHOHAM GEVA
ManagingNews Editor
Wednesday, nonprofit group the
Arts Alliance released the results
of a survey sent out to electoral can-
didates about their involvement in
and stance on support for various
aspects of the arts in Washtenaw
County.
The Alliance also held a forum
Wednesday morning with several
& the candidates'to discuss the
results.
Debra Polich, executive director
of the Arts Alliance, said the group
conducted the survey and forum
to increase focus on the arts both
for the community at large and for
elected officials by demonstrating
the impact of the creative sector on
the county.
"The importance there is again,"
Polich said, "(the creative sector)
is a voting block, and people want
their elected officials to pay atten-
tion to these issues and the policies
that can impact the sector and keep
it vibrant."

She said while there's plenty of
local engagement with the arts and
high levels of individual support in
the area, where Washtenaw County
faces a challenge in comparison to
the rest of Michigan is institutional
support, making the role of elected
officials important.
"We don't have public invest-
ment," she said. "And I mean that
public investment by dollars, but
I also mean public policy invest-
ment, making policy decisions that
really foster a climate, an environ-
ment, thatmakes the creative sector
a priority, and so that's part of the
change and that's part of the work
that we need to be doing, as advo-
cates for arts and culture for the
creative sector."
Of the candidates sent surveys,
23 returned them, including the
four Democratic candidates run-
ning for Ann Arbor mayor Ann
Arbor City Council, incumbent City
Council candidate Sumi Kailasapa-
thy (D-Ward 1), Ward 2 City Coun-
cil candidates Nancy Kaplan and
Kirk Westphal and Debbie Dingell,
who is running for the U.S. House of
Representatives in Michigan's 12th
District, which includes Ann Arbor.
When it came to the mayoral
candidates, all four expressed simi-
lar positions on the broader issue
of arts availability and engagement
in Washtenaw County, saying they

supported it. Coun-
cilmembers Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1),

DailySports Writer
NEW YORK - Though Tampa
Bay Rays ace David Price has
enjoyed an illustrious baseball
career, one single game continues
to linger in the back of his mind.
It's not the memory of when the
left-hander started the MLB All-
Star game in 2010. It's not when
Price recorded a save in Game 7 of
the 2008 ALCS to send the Rays
to their first-ever World Series.
Nor is it the games Price pitched
in 2012 en route to winning his
first Cy Young award.
It's the game Price entered
as a college junior on June 4,
2007 against Michigan, and then
exited in disgrace.
It was a beautiful night, in
the mid-80s, not a cloud to be
seen, a perfect night for baseball.
Price and No. 1 Vanderbilt had
reached extra innings against the
Wolverines in the deciding game
of the 2007 Nashville Regional.
The Commodores were
unquestionably the nation's best
team in the regular season. They
boasted a lineup that included
four current MLB players: Price,
the Pittsburgh Pirates' Pedro
Alvarez, the Atlanta Braves' Mike
Minor and the Baltimore Orioles'
Ryan Flaherty.
Michigan, meanwhile,
had success of its own, but to
Vanderbilt the
Wolverines -
were just ~

obstacle on
the way to the scar th
College World
Series. After never
all, Vanderbilt
had beaten
Michigan in the
2006 Regional with virtually the
same roster, so why would 2007
bring a new fate?
Already fortunate to take
the game to the 10th inning,
Michigan knew the deck needed
to be stacked in its favor to topple
Vanderbilt. And the Wolverines
found some luck in the barrel of
Alan Oaks' bat.
A freshman no-name who
wasn't even in the starting
lineup, Oaks silenced the 4,000
fans in attendance, hitting the
most gut-wrenching home run
in Vanderbilt history to dethrone
the Commodores, 4-3.
Seven years later, those

involved in the>game haven't
forgotten one detail of Michigan's
rendition of the "Music City
Miracle." Erik Bakich -
Michigan's current baseball
coach and Vanderbilt's hitting
coach in 2007 - can recite every
detail of the game, including
Vanderbilt's batting order, as
easily as a flight attendant can list
off safety procedures.
And neither Price nor Bakich
can forget the ball disappearing
into the perfect summer night to
complete the stunning upset.
"That's a painful scar that
will never heal," Bakich said in a
recent interview with the Daily.
"That was as high of a moment
for Michigan that was as low of
a moment for
our team at
a painful Vanderbilt."
tat will
" h ,, " If a team
were to dream
of one pitcher
being on the
mound in the
ninth inning of the deciding game
in the regional, it would be Price.
And luckily for the
Commodores, they got their wish
as Vanderbilt coach Tim Corbin
brought Price in with a man on
first with no outs.
Price, the eventual first pick
of the 2007 MLB Draft, breezed
through the ninth, striking out
two.
He thought the 10th would be
just as easy with Michigan's best
hitter, Zach Putnam, subbed due
to a double switch.
In Putnam's place, Oaks
stepped into the batter's box, and
Vanderbilt pitching coach Derek

Johnson jogged out to advise
Price.
"He was like, 'hey, he's hitting
.188, with one home run and six
RBIs,' " Price said. " 'You know
he has slider bat speed, so if you
throw him a slider, make sure it's
a good one.'
"So I was like 'Alright, well he
hasn't seen my slider yet, so I am
going to throw him the nastiest
one I've ever thrown.'"
Meanwhile, the pinch hitter's
mind was a whirlwind.
"I hadn't had an at-bat in like
two weeks," Oaks said. "So that
was going through my mind. The
next thing I thought of was that
(Price) is the best pitcher in the
country, so close your eyes and
swing hard."
Price first threw one of his
trademark sliders, but it landed in
the dirt and Oaks didn't bite. But
he never planned to swing at any
sliders. Seconds before he stepped
to the plate, Michigan coach Rich
Maloney told Oaks, "I didn't put
you in there to walk. So if you get
a strike you better be swinging."
Oaks had slider bat speed, but
the righty struggled all season
hitting breaking balls. So, on the
second pitch, when Price threw a
fastball to the outside corner and
Oaks' bat stayed idle, he knew he
made a mistake. Would Price toss
another fastball?
"The second pitch was an
outside fastball for a strike," Oaks
said, "and I didn't swing and
looked down at (Maloney) and
he wouldn't even look at me - he
was so mad."
Price's next two pitches were
sliders in the dirt. Now in a
hitter's count, three balls to one
strike, Oaks knew only one pitch
was coming: a fastball.

Former baseball coach Rich Maloney's 2007 Michigan team stunned No.1
Vanderbilt, an upset that still haunts former Commodores to this day.

Seconds later, Oaks connected
on a heater and crushed the ball
over the fence in left-center field.
"There was a lot adrenaline
and excitement after I hit it," said
Oaks, who currently pitches for
the Normal CornBelters in the
Frontier League. "After I hit the
home run, I forgot a lot, because
it was so crazy.
"I just happened to be some
young punk to come in and hit a
home run."
Oaks'homerunwonMichigan's
first regional championship
since 1984 and put an end to one
of Vanderbilt's greatest teams.
Bakich called the 2007 Vanderbilt
team the most talented team he's
ever been a part of.
"It just seemed like it wasn't
meant to be," Minor said in a low
tone, recalling Oaks' hit.
Price can't erase the memory.
In seven years, a student can
earn an undergraduate degree
and a law degree. It's also a long
enough duration for an assistant
coach to become a head coach.
Bakich, Price and Minor's head
recruiter to Vanderbilt, has now
donned the maize and blue as
Michigan's head baseball coach.
And because of Oaks' heroics,
it's occasionally a hard pill to
swallow.
"I saw that he'd signed with
Michigan and initially it was a
little weird,"
Price said. "I
was happy for
Bakich that "After I
he got a head
coaching job, home run
but the last
place I ever a lot, bet
expected him
to go was was sot
Michigan."
But despite
the change

the No. 1 team in the country at
their home field at a regional,"
Bakich said. "That was an eye-
opening moment. At that point,
it was solidified in my mind, and
probably the minds of a lot of the
coaches across the country that
Michigan is a place in baseball
that can host regionals and go to
Omaha from."
More so, that game taught
Bakich an important lesson that
he preaches to his players every
day: that the best team doesn't
always win, and that anythingcan
happen in postseason baseball.
And while Michigan hasn't
hosted a regional or even
advanced to one yet in Bakich's
tenure, if his recruiting classes
are any indication,cthe Wolverines
are heading in the right direction.
While it's odd for Price to see
Bakich coaching Michigan, Price
said he knows Michigan will
thrive under Bakich.
In fact, Price couldn't think
of a better multi-faceted coach
between Bakich's health
expertise, intensity and baseball
knowledge, even if sometimes it
got a little bizarre.
Bakich was such a health nut
that he would put a Snickers bar
in his mouth, chew it up and spit
it out to avoid the calories. He
was so enthusiastic that he would
run around shirtless in freezing
late fall weather
to pump up his
team.

leading up to his hiring.
Price and Minor both believe
any team under Bakich could
thrive.
Minor said there is no better
coach than Bakich at instilling
confidence in his players. But for
now, Bakich can only hope his
team can create a moment like the
one that still bothers David Price.

Dennison Building to be

By JAKE LOURIM
Managing Sports Editor
Haley Kopmeyer is Michigan's
all-time leader in saves, goals-
against average and minutes
played, but in the National
Women's Soccer League, there are
lots of Haley Kopmeyers.
Kopmeyer, a four-year starter
for the Wolverines, now backs
up U.S. Women's National Team
starter Hope Solo - by many
accounts the best goalie in the
world - for the Seattle Reign. So
when she made her first start June
19 for the undefeated Reign, she
knew she couldn't give up a goal.
But there was one player in
particular that she couldn't give
up a goal to - and one player in
particular who wanted to score on
her.
That player was Nkem Ezurike,
who played with Kopmeyer at
Michigan from 2010-12 and then
became the Wolverines' all-time
leading scorer last season.
"Obviously I don't want
anybody to score on me, but
there's a little bit of a rivalry there
and I was like, yeah, I definitely
can't get scored on," Kopmeyer
said. "Getting scored on by friends
is just the worst."
Kopmeyer went back to her
Michigan days to try to gain an
edge by remembering Ezurike's
strengths and weaknesses.
Ezurike had a shot at her former
teammate just before halftime, but
her header was deflected away.
"It was in the back of my mind,"
Ezurike said. "It's always funny
when you're playing against
- someone you know, you kind of
want to beat them more often than

someone you may not know. I was
hoping to get a goal against her,
but she came up bigthat game."
The two Michigan alumni
speak highly of each other off the
field, but the competitive side of
each of them came out when they
put on opposite jerseys.
Kopmeyer and Ezurike,
products of the rebuilt Michigan
women's soccer program under
coach Greg Ryan, are the
Wolverines' only two players
in the NWSL, which started
last spring. But even two of the
program's best ever say the pro
league was a major adjustment.
"I was a little shell shocked
at first - the speed of the play,
how hard the girls shot the ball,
so many parts that you can think
about, and then you actually see
it and you're like, 'OK, wow,' "
Kopmeyer said earlier this month.
"That was an adjustment and it
showed me how I needed to train,
how I needed to alter my training,
how I needed to get the game to
slow down mentally for me."
One other adjustment: This
league was a business now.
Kopmeyer wasn't easily the best
goalkeeper on the team like she
was at Michigan. Her team didn't
have to keep her around - and at
one point, they didn't, releasing
her after last season.
Kopmeyer took her lumps last
year, playing only one game in
goal, but she re-signed with the
team for this season and has a
solid footing on the league's best
team.
The same goes for Ezurike in
Boston. She also got off to a slow
start this spring in her rookie
season but has now appeared in 11

of the Breakers' 18 games, starting
six and scoringtwo goals.
Like Kopmeyer, she also found
the transition to the professional
league to be difficult.
"Starting off, I didn't get
much playing time, so practices
really helped with getting to
that intensity required for the
program," Ezurike said. "It's
just something to work at. It's a
different mindset that you've got
to step it up from what you did in
college."
For two players who were stars
in college and started for most
of their four-year careers, that
wasn't easy to do. Kopmeyer was
a mainstay in the net, and Ezurike
was the lone forward at the top of
coach Greg Ryan's 4-1-4-1 scheme.
As Kopmeyer put it, they went
from being the best players on
their team in college to a league
where every player was the best
player on her team in college.
"I have no problem admitting
that going from the college game
to the professional game was a
very massive step," she said. "I
definitely think Michigan did well
to prepare me in terms of what the
rigors of training would be like,
but it's just that talent level that
skyrockets."-
Added Ezurike: "That's part of
the game and it's kind of what you
sign up for, but it's definitely in
the back of your mind that it can
change pretty quickly."
Not too long ago, Michigan

sent players to professional
leagues. The Wolverines have had
four straight winning seasons
under Ryan, but before Ryan
arrived they hadn't had back-to-

back winning seasons since 2003-

Ryan's hiring brought major
changes to the program, but
they proved to be worthy in

Ezurike said Ryan's experience

Businesses and
local nonprofits find
benefit in influx of
tourists
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
Nearly 1,000 artists flocked
to the streets of downtown Ann
Arbor Wednesday through Sat-
urday to display their work at the
55th annual Ann Arbor Art Fair.
Though the fair is comprised of
four separate art shows, because
each fair is connected to the oth-
ers, attendees feel as though the
event is singular in nature. Debra
Clayton, Executive Director of
the Guild of Artists and Artisans,
said the guild has a tagline they
use - four fairs, one event.
The Ann Arbor Art Street
Fair was first to emerge in 1960
as an "Experiment in Arts and
Crafts." Shortly after in 1967,
the State Street Area Associa-
tion established its own fair in its
commercial district, and the fair
continued to grow when the Free
Arts Festival found local artists
to participate in 1970. This fair
is now known as the Summer
Art Fair, sponsored by the Guild

of Artists and Artisans, and is
located on Main Street and the
portion of State Street which
runs along the University's cam-
pus. After the Original Street
Fair moved to the streets sur-
rounding Burton Tower in 2003,
the South University Area Asso-
ciation hosted artists in the area
formerly occupied by the Origi-
nal Street fair.
Clayton said overall, though
each portion of Art Fair may dif-
fer in their specific mission, it's a
collaborative event held together
by the city's overall atmosphere
both for the fairs and for other
groups downtown, such as busi-
nesses.
"People like to come here,
experience our stores, our res-
taurants, the University campus,
the museum," Clayton said. " You
find it's a happy marriage and it's
a family and you think that part
of this family is the artists, the
stores, the restaurants, the Uni-
versity-everybody kind of ben-
efits."
AJ Davidson, vice president of
the Bivouac store in Ann Arbor,
has worked outside of his store
during Art Fair for the past 15
years. He said the event allows
the store to sell old merchandise
and bring in the new, making
rotation both easier and more

efficient.
"Itbrings a lot of people down-
town, which is a lot of people into
our store and it's great," David-
son said.
In addition to art, nonprofit
organizations are also given
space at the fair. Organizations
present this year included those
representing animal rights, dif-
ferent political leanings, news
publications, and various reli-
gious stances, among others.
"I think they're all doing the
same thing- mostly to promote
awareness," said Dave Arnoldi,
a volunteer at the Huron Valley
Humane Society.
When it comes to the artists
themselves, those who exhibit
their work at the fair include
both longtime returning individ-
uals as well as new ones.
Maureen Riley, Executive
Director of the Ann Arbor Street
Fair, said the amount of new ven-
dors has grown as baby boomers
retire, resulting in a shift in the
aesthetics. She added that the
Art Fair itself continues to grow
in the diversity of work it tries to
present.
"That's the beauty of the Ann
Arbor Art Fair," Riley said. "Any-
body can find something they
like, and at a price point they can
afford."
One artist, David O'Dell from
Lake Orion, Michigan said he
was mostly accustomed to par-
ticipating in galleries. He creates
rock 'n' roll posters as well as
prints of cars, taken from pho-
tographs his father took decades
ago at events such as Beatles con-
certs and the Indie 500.
"I'm trying to figure out what
goes well in a fair," O'Dell said.
"But people said you should try
the Ann Arbor Fair-it's fabu-
lous."
Jerry Wygant, an artist from
Pentwater, Michigan who works
with various types of wood he
collects himself, was stationed
on State Street in his permanent
spot for the 12th year. He began
working with wood to make jew-
elry and other accessories over
25 years ago.
"The reason I love the whole
show is that I meet so many
educated people here," Wygant
said. "They're working on doc-
torates and they're from all over
the world and they're interesting
people."

Regents approve $49
million project with
aim of increasing
collaboration
By MICHAEL SPAETH
For the Daily
The home of physics and
astronomy - the David M. Den-
nison Building - is set to receive
both a physical makeover, as well
as a change of tenants.
According to a plan approved
by the Board of Regents on July
17, the building will be reno-
vated to become the new home
of centers, institutes and units
focusing on international engage-
ment. Renovations will focus on
the 10-story high-rise section of
the building, which will include
extending windows outward on
the 10th floor as well as a plan to
enclose the overhang area on the
ground floor for added space.
The International Institute
and all of its centers will move
from the School of Social Work
Building to Dennison, and LSA
centers focusing on international
engagement will also relocate
to Dennison. The Department
of Astronomy, currently housed
in Dennison, will move to West
Hall, which is currently undergo-
ing a renovation of its own.
At the regents meeting on the
17th, Provost Martha E. Pollack
praised the renovation plan and
noted Dennison's unique history.
"I just want to quickly men-
tion that virtually every student
that has been at the University
of Michigan probably in the last
fifty years has taken a class in
Dennison," Pollack said. "I think
it's fair to say that it's one of our
most run-down buildings and
this renovation is really going to
make it quite the opposite, and it's
going to take the International
Institute, which are increas-
ingly important as our students
do more global work, give them a
nice home, make it actually more
efficient on campus."
In the proposal approved by
the board, Chief Financial Offi-
cer Douglas Strong, interim exec-
utive vice president, estimated

the renovation cost to be $49 mil-
lion.
"A renovation of approximately
106,000 gross square feet vacated
by the relocation of the Depart-
ment of Astronomy to West Hall
and the repurposing of class-
rooms will create spaces that will
facilitate faculty collaboration
and enhance opportunities for
graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents," Strong submitted in the
proposal.
Devon Keen, program manager
at the University's African Stud-
ies Center, which is a part of the
International Institute, one of the
building's new proposed tenants,
said while their current location
at the School of Social Work is
great, crowding has occasionally
been a problem.
"There are many centers here
and we could definitely use some
expanded common space," she
said. "There's not a lot of room for
events, so we are often vying for
the same space during the busiest
times of the year, because we have
really one big room that's used for
large events, and then smaller
rooms."
Keen said for the move, one
important aspect will be pre-
serving each of the International
Institute's centers' unique identi-
ties in its new Dennison facilities.
"It's very important to us that
the identity of each individual
center is maintained so that if
someone walks into this space,
they'll be able to clearly see, oh,
'I'm now in the African Studies
Center,' or 'I'm now at the Cen-
ter for Southeast Asian Studies,'
because I think that's part of what
draws people to us, is that indi-
viduality of each center," Keen
said.
She added that overall, she
would like the African Studies
Center to have more space for
events, lectures, meetings and
other activities in Dennison.
"It's always nice to have a new,
upgraded surrounding, and I'm
very interested to see how it will
look in the end," Keen said.
A schematic design for the
building, which will provide more
details about space allocation
in the building, has not yet been
submitted to or approved by the
regents.

Minimizing maternal deaths
Poverty must be addressed to lower deaths related to pregnancy
n early July, it was announced that Detroit's maternal death
rate is three times the national average. Between 2008 and 2011,
the Department of Community Health reported that 26 Detroit
women died as a direct result of pregnancy or childbirth. Fortunately,
two months earlier, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan alongside Wayne
State University, Henry Ford Health System, the Detroit Medical
Center and several other partners launched the "Make Your Date"
campaign to help expectant mothers in need. While it's extremely
important that the campaign continue to grow and assist mothers in
need, Duggan and Republican Gov. Rick Snyder must also address
the root cause of the drastic maternal death rate: poverty.

This past March Sigma Alpha
Epsilon's Supreme Council
decided to eliminate the
fraternity's pledge
programs entirely.
"As an
organization, we
have been plagued
with too much
bad behavior,
which resulted
in loss of lives, ZAK
negative press and WITUS
lawsuits," Bradley
M. Cohen, the
Eminent Supreme Archon, President
of SAE's national organization, said in
a YouTube video. "In order to survive,
we must change not only some of our
practices, but our culture."
SAE isn't the only fraternity
organization that might want to listen
to Cohen's advice. Though SAE is a
particularly deadly fraternity (nine
people have died in events connected
with SAE since 2006), overall "there
have been more than 60 fraternity-
related deaths in the U.S. since 2005,"
according to Bloomberg News. In
today's Greek Life, the "bad behavior"
no longer seems to be rare or
anomalous, but instead disturbingly
normal and common. What's more,
as anyone even remotely involved
on college campuses probably
knows, the troubling examples and
results of "bad behavior" don't just
include death, negative press or
lawsuits, but violence, hazing, sexual
assault (including rape), among
other misconduct.
Eventually we might ask whether
today's fraternity system produces
this "bad behavior" because it's
intrinsically flawed, or whether the
"bad behavior" is just the fault of a few
bad individuals.
Most fraternities and universities
answer that it's the latter case. In a
statement, SAE's national fraternity
organization said that members
who violate its rules "are in no way
representative of the fraternity."
Though, according to the New York
Times, "Numerous studies show that
members of Greek organizations
drink more heavily than other
students, and alcohol abuse is strongly
tied to other forms of misconduct. But
(once again) in interviews at multiple
campuses, fraternity members said
their reputations was tainted by the.
bad acts of others."
Patricia Telles-Irvin, Northwestern
University's vice president for student
affairs, said, "We have to be very
careful before we blame the Greeks."
Telles-Irvin doesn't claim that
"the Greeks" are innocent, but she
believes that it's because "they're so

visible that they get easily targeted."
Dartmouth college President and
former University provost Philip J.
Hanlon appears to hold a similar
view. In response to sexual assault
at Dartmouth and what he calls "a
culture where dangerous drinking
has become the rule," Hanlon didn't
single out fraternities, despite the
fraternities at his school largely
dominating social life and recently
facing intense criticism.
. But why not single out fraternities?
If they're so visibly a part of the
problem, then why not blame them?
Of course fraternities don't deserve
all the blame, and further restricting
Greek Life probably won't definitively
end death, sexual assault and so on, on
college campuses, but it will end some.
By denouncing individual
fraternities and individual members,
the larger fraternity institution tries
to protect itself from ridicule and
thereby survive. This happened when
Theta Xi's national organization
tried to isolate the blame to the one
University chapter member who
posted a racist Facebook party invite;
when Alpha Epsilon Pi's national
organization ousted University senior
Andrew Koffsky from his chapter
presidency after he publicly admitted
to hazing allegations; and when
Arizona State University suspended
Tau Kappa Epsilon's chapter for
several violations.
If fraternity and University officials
were not to scandalize the bad
behavior but instead acknowledge
that they lead a corrupt system and
institution, they would risk their
own destruction, thereby rendering
their acknowledgement an act of
suicide. Therefore, because we cannot
reasonably expect them to be so
self-critical, we must ask whether
the scandalizing response of the
fraternity institution is legitimate
and based on facts, or merely based on
private interest.
My intuition is that the fraternity
system creates "bad behavior" not on
accident, but as the normal byproduct
of being secretive institutions with
problematic ideas of manliness that
praise alcoholism and womanizing
while having unjust immunity from
policing. But, we shouldn't simply
follow my intuition or anybody else's.
We should continue to research the
question of the legitimacy of Greek
Life and the scandalizing claims of its
officials while remaining open to the
anti-establishment explanation that
"bad behavior" might just be a normal
aspect of frat life.

India. As the classic Hindi song embellishes countless stories
"Khalnayak" (roughly translat- - mostly stemming from innu-
ing to "badass motherfucker with merable references to classic Hol-
a pimp-ass hat") blares through lywood gangster flicks - with

individual quirks that harken to
an almost Tarantino-esque treat-
ment of character. Early along, in
the film's very first act, the final
mission is written in blood, but
as in "Reservoir Dogs" or "Jackie
Brown," we only climb on for the
five-hour-long ride because every-
thing that happens in between is
doused in self-referential hilar-
ity: The murderous, blade-chew-
ing psychopath who perpetually
speaks with alisp; the fact that Sar-
dar's second oldest son, Kashyap's
Michael Corleone, is a pothead;
the flirting (ft. random goat). The
number of times the word "penis"
is screamed at random passersby.
Still, despite an undeniably
hilarious sequence of vignettes to
tie the story together, the film's
heart pulses with the rise and
eventual demise of the Khan clan.
In doing so, the movie adopts a
somewhat beaten stance about the
perils of heedless greed - the con-
stant need to one-up the competi-
tion even if the outcome is chaos.
But the more intriguing bit is how
Kashyap threads the movement of
time using pop culture references
to each passing decade's Bolly-
wood hits. And in doing so, he
again forces us to confront the role
this far-reaching media can play
in the violence unfolding in small,
education-lacking towns like Was-
seypur. The bloated, unrealistic
portrayals of masculinity these
films adopt can be seen influencing
the characters' displays of ferocity,
with Kashyap taking special care
to use various Hindi movie songs
in scoringthe aftermath of or lead
up to a fatal conflict.
"Wasseypur" solidifies itself as
arguably the greatest Hindi film
I'll ever see because it forces us to
look directly at the bloody after-
math. The mini-Indian history
lessons are narrated detachedly
and presented in black-and-white
news format to give matter-of-
fact information about the stark
realities in the small mining vil-
lages of northern India. Guns are
eventually imported from neigh-
boring towns. The money-making
schemes become more complex.
The Internet makes a cameo. But
the real intrigue lies with the
realization that Bollywood can be
seen filling in the human side, and
as "Wasseypur" makes clear, fuck
the soap operas, because the mes-
sage has to change.

Detroit's maternal death
rate is grossly inflated with
58.7 deaths per 100,000
babies. While this number
is highly unacceptable, it's
not surprising given the
linkpercent of the city's
population live below the
poverty line, which is only
made worse by a lack of
education and deteriorated
living conditions. Women
in poverty are less likely to
receive consistent medical care
throughout pregnancy, putting
a large number of Detroit's
expectant mothers at risk.
This situation contributes to a
maternal death rate in the city
that's higher than countries
such as Libya, Uruguay
and Vietnam.
While health care before and
duringpregnancyisimportant,
Dr. Sonia Hassan - a dean for

maternal, perinatal and child
healthcare - insists that good
health prior to pregnancy is
vital for "cutting down the
risk of obesity, hypertension,
diabetes." Preventing these
conditions is strongly rooted
in a healthy diet and exercise,
solutions that many Detroit
residents do not have access
to. The expense of healthy
eating can be difficult for
many to afford, so women in
lower socioeconomic groups
struggle to pay for the lifestyle
that decreases the likelihood
of maternal deaths.
"Make Your Date" is
vehementlyworkingto"ensure
that every pregnant woman in
every neighborhood knows
that our great city is stepping
up to provide support and
ensure she delivers a healthy,
happy baby." The campaign

along with several provisions
in the Affordable Care Act help
provide preventive service
coverage to women with no
cost-sharing. Women are
provided with services such
as pap smears, mammograms,
vaccinations, colonoscopies,
contraception and screening
without needing to pay a
portion of the cost.
Providing a wide array
of fully-covered services
will help women, yet more
must be done to provide
healthy opportunities for
women in these conditions.
Implementing initiatives
to decrease the root of the
problem - Detroit's high
poverty levels - alongside
thoroughly educating the
public will help thousands of
pregnant women in Detroit
deliver their babies safely.

a money or murder, it can actually
rearrange priorities (especially in
- the light of violence) and refocus

about what he dreamed of as a kid.

it's longevity. A longer life. More

ess, the two are able to reify life in

He made it out. He made it to L.A.,

House. "Survivor soldier a child is

about himself on "Real," and he's
exactly right. Three years have
passed since his last release. True
to his own creed, Nobody's Smiling
makes it obvious that he let none of
that time go to waste.

American campers in Michigan.
When I was introduced as
"The Writing Teacher" to my

swam through the air. One boy
put his head down on the desk.
"Writing!" he sighed in dismay.
"I hate writing." During my first

Writing as fuel

unquantifiable task, rather than a
form of play and relevance.
My students like stories.
They like hearing about slabs of
pineapple pizza, thunderstorms,
monkey kings. Today, I had my
students create myths or legends
that spoke to their Chinese-
American experiences. They wrote
about moon cakes that induced
laser vision. They wrote about
Voldemortperformingatraditional
Chinese fan dance. They wrote
about superhero dumplings,
kitchen sink monsters and peach
trees. When my students toss
their hands up, I tell them they
do, in fact, know how to write. So
much of writing is just a process
of swimming through the brain's
jungles and wires. Oftentimes,
writing is just the end product of a
long process of thinking. Writing
untangles our grits of thought and
makes them tangible. What makes
it all so difficult is that in order to
write, one must trust the brain to
do its own funky, imperfect dance.
When I teach writing
workshops, the constant
challenge is in re-discovering
why reading and writing matter
in their ability to reshape ground
and pummel through doors. I
remind my students that poetry,
prose and all forms of writing
can forge visual and verbal
connections. Writing acts as both
a translation and a re-vision for
our worlds. And above all, the
process of writing gives us access
to play.
People don't understand why
I spend so many of my waking
hours living with poetry and
prose. "Where's the value in
that?" they ask. Others seem to
place poetry on the side: "That's
a great hobby, but... you should
really find a steadier source of
income." I shrug my shoulders.
My LinkedIn profile features
a hilarious assortment of past
jobs, most of which relate to
storytelling. I'm proud. I
celebrate. I ask questions, record
shit, swing, chase, write.
Recently, Filipino-American
poet Patrick Rosal published a
piece in the New York Times
explaining why we should pay
attention to poetry as necessity.
"Part of the problem is our

assessment of poetry is about
awards, publications and
appointments. Not enough is
about how everyday people are
moved by poems," Rosal wrote.
"Truth is, they are hungry for
it - especially when it's written,
read, performed and listened to
with the whole body."
Poetry, as Rosal described it,
becomes a bodily experience,
and one that we ache for.
Perhaps this "hunger" is what
we need young people to learn
in schools. Writing poetry, prose
or essays isn't dull. Writing isn't
unconquerable. Being a writer
offers you the opportunity to also
be a firefighter, a lawyer, a doctor,
a gardener, a juggler. Writers
are never only writers. They are
collage-makers, pulling from a
mash-up of fields and experiences,
weaving together, playing with
language to construct.
"I write poems," I told my
eye doctor last week, when he
asked what I aimed to do post-
graduation. "Wow," he said,
jamming an eye drop into my eye,
"That's certainly ... mysterious."
I blinked, and contact solution
dripped menacingly down my face.
The more we intake the
writing process as mystery,
the less likely we are to access
it. Perhaps it's naive, but I'm
convinced that writing offers a
type of fuel for efficient problem-
solving. Writing can move us
through the wcrld with vigor
and curiosity. I tell my students
not to think of themselves as
"good" or "bad" writers. They all
have stories. They all have wrists
and throats and mouths. They
are joyful, and small. Some wear
oversized soccer jerseys to class
and others eat green peppers
at lunch, while still others
marvel over silver paperclips.
My students are learning how
to seize joy through learning
how to experiment with
language. Through writing,
they're learning how to ask
questions. They're learning how
to hatch rage. It's important,
complicated, messy work. It's
work that counts.

From the BSU's perspective,

said. "I've never been at an institu-

Harper agreed with his com-
ments, citing the long history of

she said positioned the University

DETROIT BEAT
General Motors CEO
Mary Barra in midst
of difficult summer

'Trouble in Paradse No Smilin
i Vn Chicago

Detroit automaker
recovering from
ignition switch recall
By KATIE BURKE
ManagingEditor
General Motors CEO Mary
Barra began the summer in the
Big House, delivering a speech to
University graduates that offered
advice for the future.
Last week, she appeared in
front of Congress for the fourth
time in four months, addressing
an audience that was much less
welcoming than the class of 2014.
Barra did not mention GM in
her commencement address in
May, even though the company
was in the midst of a crisis that
would call into question the cul-
ture of one of Detroit's major
automakers.
Detroit has been home to
American automakers since
Henry Ford and William Mur-
phy founded the Detroit Auto-
mobile Company in 1899. Since
then, three have emerged as the
foremost U.S. automakers: Ford
Motor Company, Chrysler Group
LLC and General Motors.
The three automakers have
weathered a number of storms
over the past decades, from the oil
crises in 1973 and 1979, to the Ford
tire failure controversy in 2000,
to the GM and Chrysler bailouts
of 2009, all of which have had
ripple effects on their home city.
The most recent jolt to the
industry began Feb. 13, when GM
recalled 619,122 Chevrolet Cobalt
and Pontiac GS models, both cars
that sold well when they were on
the market.
What began as a routine recall
notice - 714 recalls affecting
27,957,339 vehicles were issued
in 2013, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-
tration - quickly led to the pub-
lic revelation of a faulty ignition
switch linked to 13 deaths and 54
accidents.
One month earlier, Barra had
assumed office as the first female
executive of a major automaker.
According to GM, she was noti-
fied of the defective ignition

switch Jan. 31, two weeks later,
leading to the initial recall. By
March 17, 2.6 million vehicles had
been recalled and three days later,
the U.S. House of Representatives
Energy and Commerce Commit-
tee announced its first investiga-
tive hearing into the issue.
This is the second major auto
company recall this decade fol-
lowing a 2010 Toyota recall
sparked by unintended accel-
eration in the Prius and other
models. The company eventually
recalled 15.43 million vehicles
worldwide, and was fined $17.4
million by the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
While the Toyota recall
occurred on a massive global
scale, the implications of the
GM crisis hit much closer to the
Motor City.
How the switch came to be
In pursuit of a smoother igni-
tion switch, GM engineers began
working on a new design in
1997. Between 1999 and 2001, an
engineer named Ray DeGiorgio
was given control of the design
and was ultimately in charge of
approving the final design speci-
fication in March 2001.
After its initial design approv-
al, the switch had proven prob-
lematic in testing. There were
multiple reports of the switch
slipping from "run" to "acces-
sory" modes, as well as electrical
issues. By design, when the igni-
tion switch is no longer in "run"
mode, airbags will not deploy.
DeGiorgio and his team
attempted to address these
problems in time for the vehicle
launches of the Saturn Ion and
Chevrolet Cobalt. In internal
emails, DeGiorgio referred to it as
"the switch from hell."
According to an internal
investigation, in 2002 DeGiorgio
approved the switch design for
production, even though it had
not yet met torque requirements.
Reports of vehicle stalling con-
tinued to be brought to the engi-
neer's attention in the following

Elly Jackson a.k.a La Roux
Danceable beats
fill La Roux's 80s
throwback album
By ADAM DEPOLLO
OnlineArtsEditor
It's been five years since Eng-
lish synthpop duo La Roux - then
composed of singer/multi-instru-
mentalist Elly Jackson and pro-
ducer Ben Langmaid - released
its eponymous
debut album,
which featured
the massively Trouble in
successful sin-
gles "Bullet- ParadiSe
proof" and "In La Roux
for the Kill."
The years since Polydor
2009 have pre-
sented a number
of obstacles for
Jackson, including a debilitating
bout of performance anxiety, but,
after parting ways with Langmaid
over creative differences, La Roux
has returned as a solo act with
its infectious sophomore release
Trouble in Paradise.
On 2009's LaRoux, Jackson and
Langmaid successfully blended
'80s chic with elements of the late
'00s club sound on the album's
radio-ready singles, but the LP's
deeper cuts were something of a
disappointment. While the dis-
tillation of punchy square synths
and 808 percussion worked on
"Bulletproof," it left the rest of the
album feeling sparse and incom-

plete, as though it were begging
for a remix that La Roux wasn't
quite ready to provide.
Fortunately, the creative split
between the duo's members seems
to have opened the way for Jack-
son to pursue her '80s throwback
aesthetic to its potently dance-
able and upbeat conclusions on
her latest release. Opening with
"Uptight Downtown," Jackson
delivers a string of well-crafted
melodies and contagious cho-
ruses over buoyant analog synths
on the album's more club-ready
tracks and lush piano riffs and
vocal harmonies on ballads like
"Paradise Is You." Jackson's ear
for melody is particularly strong
on the chorus of "Cruel Sexual-
ity," a dance track with traces of
Graceland-era Paul Simon," and
on the mildly tropical synth lines
of "Sexotheque."
Trouble in Paradise's produc-
tion, provided largely by Eng-
lishman Ian Sherwin, is just as
impressive as the album's song-
writing. The warm lo-fi halo
floating over Jackson's voice adds
an inviting color to the LP while
providing a touch of nostalgic
'80s fuzz to the whole project - a
number of the tracks, particular-
ly "Cruel Sexuality" and "Silent
Partner" with their driving ana-
log bass lines and echoing vocals,
sound like they were recorded
inside of a David Bowie music
video. You can almost see the fog
machines and angular shoulder .
pads sticking out through the
mix.
This album's biggest stumbling

block, however, is Jackson's lyrics,
which, while exploring the rocky
aspects of relationships implied
by the record's title, don't offer
much in the way of innovation or
even particularly creative imag-
ery. Even on the most interesting
lyrical track "Paradise Is You,"
Jackson is dealing with ideas, like
losing yourself in your lover, that
we've all heard before.
And, while I could overlook
Jackson's lyrics if she ended the
album on a strong note with the
catchy single and second-to-last
song "Let Me Down Gently," she
unfortunately closes out the LP
with its most disappointing track
"The Feeling." In comparison with
the finely wrought '80s aesthetics
on the rest of the album, this cut's
badly mixed bass lines and drums
are an unexpected turn. The lack-
luster production blends poorly
with Jackson's weak falsetto and
clumsy vocal harmonies, making
this track seem like a half-finished
demo that was mistakenly tacked
onto the album's final cut.
With the exception of the
album's weak finish, however,
Trouble in Paradise is a solid fol-
low-up to La Roux's debut album
that, while lacking any obvious
hits along the lines of "Bullet-
proof," is a much more satisfying
release. Few of the LP's first eight
tracks feel incomplete in the way
that much of La Roux did, and
Jackson has clearly come into
her own as a songwriter, crafting
refreshingly nostalgic pop tracks
that still sound like they were
made in 2014.

There's something unsettling
about Lonnie Lynn's voice. His
distorted mid-range flow some-
times smears
over the treble/
bass border. It's
gravelly. His Nobody's
inflection seems .
rather venom- Smiling
ous at times, and Common
when you hear it
string together ARTium
his somber mate-
rial you start to
have thoughts like "Man, if this
guy is rapping about Chicago
crime, it must really be a huge
problem". And that's precisely
what Common does on Nobody's
Smiling. The whole album is a log
for his thoughts about growing
up in Chicago, being confronted
with violence at an early age and
grieving for murdered friends and
family. The particular immaterial
quality of his voice allows him to
give his subject matter a unique
importance, a cut-the-shit direct-
ness that aims its five-fingered
death punch straight at your fore-
head. And before you can recog-
nize it happening, Common takes
the podium as the experienced
teacher and you become his happy
pupil. Listen and learn, he says on
Nobody's Smiling: I'll tell it like it
is.
Lesson 1: Album artwork
counts.
Nobody'sSmilingis the aesthetic
opposite of Common's sixth album
Be, the uplifting, jazz-sprinkled
soul project that proved he could
delve into the root of hip-hop and
still maintain his funk. The most
immediate difference between
Be and Nobody's Smiling is the
album cover. Be's cover is tainted
with a tangerine glow, upon which
Common's Marvin Gaye-esque
profile grins openly. Its warmth
and sincerity reveals much about
the album's power through spo-
ken word: stories told around the
halo of a fire. Nobody's Smiling, on
the other hand, takes its moniker
very literally. Common's stony face
emerges like a ghost, his eyes dark

as coal, the front of his pale face
turned aslant now, the whole look
of him bending into shadow. From
the second we notice its correla-
tion to Be, we learn that Common
has set a pretty high mark for the
album. His is grave business, after
all.
Lesson 2: Politics have
changed very little in south-side
Chicago.
Sure, Common has had his
share of political involvement with
campaigns, protests and charity.
And sure, he even took a special
trip to the White House in 2011 to
perform for the Obamas. But if Be
was his grand inaugural address,
then Nobody's Smiling is his sol-
emn campfire talk, in which he
bears the heft of his anxiety about
Chicago crime to the people who
might not know better. R&B pro-
duction wizard James Fauntleroy
kicks off the opening track "The
Neighborhood" with a plea, his
voice straining from somewhere in
empty space: "But be careful don't
drown in the gold/I know it glows
but it's cold." A chorus of shrill
trumpets shatters the peace. Com-
mon and Lil Herb (hailing from
'Terror town' in Chicago) use the
rest of the song to explain just how
impossible it is to leavea neighbor-
hood in Chicago and how consis-
tently dangerous it is to challenge
any of the neighborhood rules.
Urban division often translates
to political division, they seem to
state - not the other way around.
Lesson 3: Gloomhas a place in
an album's sound.
While Common busies himself
with painting a bleak and even
tragic portrait of Chicago, pro-
ducer No I.D. crafts even bleaker
instrumentation. With the excep-
tion of "Hustle Harder" and
"Real" - two tracks that gracefully
address sexuality in the midst of
violence - the beats are thunder-
ous, the bass is deep and an elec-
tric tinge galvanizes the album's
neo-soul vibe. Horn sections fil-
tered through mix machines and a
score of wiry classical instruments
each add beauty to an otherwise
desolate soundscape. No I.D. has
delivered his trademark intensity
