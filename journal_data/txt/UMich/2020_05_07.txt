Every year in May, thousands 
of families pour into Ann Arbor 
to 
celebrate 
the 
University 
of Michigan’s yearly spring 
commencement. Although this 
year’s spring commencement 
was 
virtual, 
there 
are 
plans to have an in-person 
commencement 
next 
spring. 
For 
Ann 
Arbor 
businesses, 
spring commencement is just as 
important for their livelihood as 
it is for the graduating class.
Popular restaurants tend to 
be fully booked months out from 
spring commencement, hotels 
are packed with the arriving 
families and the streets become 
full with visitors, who stop into 
local businesses to browse, eat 
or drink. 
Andy Labarre, the executive 
vice 
president 
and 
director 
of government relations for 
the 
Ann 
Arbor/Ypsilanti 
Regional 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce, remarked on spring 
commencement’s 
impact 
on 
local businesses.
“It’s a big weekend,” Labarre 
said. “You tend to have big 
parties, you tend to have all 
your spots filled and folks tend 
to be celebratory — so, frankly, 

they’re buying and drinking a 
lot more.”
Slurping 
Turtle, 
an 
Ann 
Arbor 
restaurant 
on 
East 
Liberty Street, usually books 
its 
first 
tables 
for 
spring 
commencement as early as the 
start of the school year, with a 
more constant stream of calls 
starting in January. Michael 
Persa, Slurping Turtle’s director 
of operations, commented on 
the 
early 
preparation 
most 
families make.
“We’re fairly new, we’re only 
five or six years here,” Persa 
said. “But last year, I think by 
March, we were 90 percent 
booked.”
2020 
Public 
Policy 
graduate Ethan Ramer is from 
Livingston, New Jersey, and 
made reservations for his twelve 
expected guests well before the 
University’s announcement that 
spring commencement would 
be canceled. He said making 
reservations 
was 
difficult 
even a year in advance due to 
the high demand with spring 
commencement. 
“My family and I booked six 
hotel rooms one year in advance 
(in May 2019) and had five 
restaurant reservations booked 
when restaurants started taking 
reservations,” 
Ramer 
said. 
“When we called a lot of the 

restaurants were already full.”
His family was planning on 
staying for multiple days, so 
they booked tables or got on 
the waitlist at popular spots 
like 
Zingerman’s 
Roadhouse 
and The Gandy Dancer, among 
others, most of which took 
deposits or noted their credit 
card information. Ramer said 
the restaurants refunded all 
deposits made. 
Spring 
commencement 
weekend is crucial for most 
businesses. For some, it may even 
dictate whether they stay open 
or not – even without a global 
pandemic. Labarre compared 
what this weekend means to the 
summer time, when large labor 
conventions in the area draw a 
significant amount of revenue 
for Ann Arbor restaurants.
“There are some restaurants 
on Main Street in Ann Arbor 
where, if they have a bad week 
during convention season … that 
can be make-or-break for the 
year,” Labarre said. “You look 
at it like the equivalent of half 
a week gone, and not just any 
standard half-week, but rather 
one in which they’re going to 
make a significant amount of 
their budget.”

Ann Arbor businesses hit hard by 
no in-person spring commencement

Design by Maggie Wiebe 

When LSA junior Cat Groenke 
returned home to California after cam-
pus shut down, she came home to a new 
dog.
After their previous two dogs passed 
away, Groenke said her family was look-
ing for a new pet. A friend referred them 
to a Facebook post about Arya, a mutt 
rescued from Mexico.
“My mom had put our family on a 
list with a bunch of humane societies 
for a pet adoption or a pet foster, but 
because of COVID there weren’t really 
any available because everyone and 
their mother is getting pets,” Groenke 
said. “So the way we got Arya, she was 
on the streets of Mexico … There’s a fos-
ter organization that one of my mom’s 
friends follows on Facebook … (She) 
saw the post and said that looks exactly 
like the kind of dog the Groenke family 
needs. Within a day of her being posted, 
my mom was like ‘OK, yeah’ and went 
down and got her.”
Groenke’s family was already in the 
market for a new dog, but the COVID-
19 outbreak has sparked an interest 
in adopting pets across the country, 
as stay-at-home orders keep people at 
home with an abundance of free time. 
Nationally, there has been increased 
interest in pet adoptions and fostering.
The Humane Society of Huron 
Valley has served Washtenaw County 
for more than a century. HSHV 
altered its operations in response to 
the pandemic, though adoptions are 
still taking place. Tanya Hilgendorf, 
president and CEO of HSHV, clarified

On Wednesday afternoon, for-
mer second lady Jill Biden held a 
virtual roundtable in recognition 
of National Nurses Day. Michigan 
Attorney General Dana Nessel 
and nurses from health systems 
in Detroit and Ann Arbor spoke at 
the meeting.
Nessel began the conversation 
by highlighting the work her office 
is doing to ensure nurses and their 
families have all the protections 
they need. She mentioned price 
gouging as a major issue, specifi-
cally on goods households need to 
prevent the spread of COVID-19, 
such as disinfectant supplies. 
“We are seeing worse inci-
dences of price gouging than we 
have ever seen in the history of 
our state, and it is not an exaggera-
tion,” Nessel said. “Typically we 
get about 80 price gouging com-
plaints a year. In the last month we 
have gotten over 4,000.” 
The Michigan Department of 
Attorney General is also working 
to combat COVID-19 scams and 
enforce Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s 
executive orders, Nessel said. She 
explained that the office is work-
ing on issues she never imagined, 
such as ensuring proper steriliza-
tion techniques for personal pro-
tective equipment. 
“The first time I ever ran for 
office at all was in 2018, so I don’t 
have a great frame of reference in 
terms of how things are supposed 
to work during a time of national 
emergency, but this can’t be the 
right way for our nation to oper-
ate during a crisis of this nature,” 
Nessel said. “We have to do better 
than this.” 
Biden shifted the conversation 
by declaring her appreciation and 
gratitude toward nurses and her 
rationale for hosting the discus-
sion. 
“Michigan was my very last 
travel day and since then, like so 
many Americans, I have been at 
home,” Biden said. “We’ve had to 
figure out how to run a presiden-
tial campaign when you can’t fly 

or have a bus tour or even visit 
peoples’ homes … as I thought 
about who I wanted to hear from 
and who I wanted to meet with, I 
thought of the people who aren’t 
home right now.” 
Michigan Medicine nurse Katie 
Oppenheim, chair of the Universi-
ty of Michigan Professional Nurse 
Council, described the discrepan-
cy between nurses’ current public 
image and what nurses are actu-
ally going through.
“When people think about 
terms about how they describe 
nurses, people say we’re ‘strong,’ 
we’re ‘smart,’ we use evidence-
based practice or skill,” Oppen-
heim said. “But right now I see 
immense moral distress among 
our workforce.” 
Oppenheim 
emphasized 
she 
has never seen anything like the 
COVID-19 pandemic before. 
“I have been a nurse for 42 
years and worked in Cambodia 
in a refugee camp and I’ve trav-
eled the world in a lot of different 
capacities,” Oppenheim said. “It is 
extremely challenging for people 
to get through these times, pay the 
right attention to the patients and 
take care of themselves because of 
that moral distress. It is something 
I never thought I would see out-
side of working in a refugee camp.” 
Tennessee registered medical 
assistant 
Gwendolyn 
Johnson-
Smith acknowledged that despite 
the greater resources and com-
pensation of nurses in the United 
States compared to third-world 
countries, leadership could have 
done better to support the crisis. 
“We are looking for a stable 
hand in leadership that will push 
international laws that people can 
listen to,” Johnson-Smith said. 
“We want someone that can make 
America an example for the rest of 
the world … third-world countries 
should be able to look at America 
and know that our leaders mean 
business.” 
Biden responded to Johnson-
Smith’s calls for leadership by 
iterating 
what 
her 
husband’s 
administration is planning to 
implement if elected in November. 
“One of the things he has already 
said is he would have an office of

Nurses Day event

Videoconferencing 
security and privacy is 
questioned

During the final minutes of the 
last online lecture for Public Health 
318: Food Literacy for All, the call was 
hijacked with hate images and racial 
slurs against African Americans for 
roughly a minute before the instructor 
ended the call.
Summer news editor Kristina 
Zheng 
talked 
to 
students 
and 
instructors of the course to hear their 
reaction to what the FBI has titled 
“Zoom-bombings” in which hackers 
infiltrate calls.
Public Health student Madison 
Fishler logged onto Zoom on 
Tuesday evening for her final class 
in Public Health 318: Food Literacy 
for All. As the class was wrapping 
up, the call was hijacked with hate 
images and racial slurs against 
African Americans for about a 
minute before the instructors ended 
the call, Fishler explained. 
“I was taken aback,” Fishler 
said. “I’m Caucasian, but I was still 
very hurt and impacted by this. 
It was very weird to me. I kind of 
felt disgusted, kind of sick to my 
stomach that this was happening.”
Since schools across the country 
have transitioned to online learning, 
the 
videoconferencing 
platform 
Zoom has become a popular tool 
for students sheltered at home. 
However, while more and more 
students log onto Zoom, concerns 

with its security and privacy have 
only increased.
The FBI issued a warning 
on March 30 regarding “Zoom-
bombings,” an interruption in which 
intruders disrupt video calls with 
threatening language and offensive 
images. According to the warning, 
the FBI has received reports of 
Zoom-bombings nationwide.
Fishler felt the security breach 
was unexpected, given how recent 
these 
Zoom-bombing 
incidents 
have 
occured. 
She 
said 
the 
security breach also made her feel 
uncomfortable with using platforms 
like Zoom. 
“It made me feel like my privacy 
was intruded,” Fishler said. “I would 
like to see the school using better 
platforms, but also who would 
have known? This Zoom-bombing 
has only been happening since this 
COVID situation.”
Cindy Leung, Public Health 
assistant professor, and Lilly Fink 
Shapiro, University of Michigan 
Sustainable Food System Initiative 
program 
manager, 
are 
both 
leaders 
of 
the 
course. 
Leung 
and Fink Shapiro said the class 
was designed as an academic-
community partnership, in which 
guest speakers in a variety of sectors 
engage with students about the 
crises and opportunities in today’s 
food system. They said a unique 
feature of the course is the ability 
of community members from Ann 
Arbor, Detroit and areas across the 
state to join and engage with the 
class.

On Saturday, the University of 
Michigan held online commence-
ment activities in place of the can-
celled Spring Commencement due 
to COVID-19. 
The online activities included 
a recorded message posted on the 
commencement page from Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel, 
Interim Provost Susan M. Collins 
and the deans.
“Yes, these are turbulent times,” 
Collins said. “But smooth seas do 
not make the most skillful sailors. 
You are ready to put your many tal-
ents to work in a world that truly 
needs your energy and your ideas.”
Former Vice President Al Gore 
and American playwright Domi-
nique Morrisseau, the previously 
planned commencement speakers, 
gave speeches, and alumni and 
coaches created congratulatory 
videos.
“I do believe these are the times 
that show us who we are and what 
we’re really made of,” Morrisseau 
said. “I look forward to seeing 
how this is going to impact you all, 
the future, a generation of future 
global citizens and how this will 
inspire you to make amazing glob-
al impact and change — positive 
change — that this world is going 
to need.”
There 
were 
also 
recorded 
performances by the Michigan 
Marching Band and the Men’s and 
Women’s Glee Clubs. 
In an effort to bring the celebra-
tion to social media, a “virtual 
maize out” invited people to post 
pictures wearing maize and blue 
with the hashtag “#MGoGrad.” 
Themed Facebook frames, Snap-
chat lenses, Giphy stickers and 
Zoom backgrounds were created 
as graduation-themed methods for 
the campus community to interact 
through social media platforms. 
Schools, colleges and other 
groups across campus also shared 
links to their graduation celebra-
tions on the commencement page. 
LSA had a recorded message from 

LSA Dean Anne Curzan, as well 
as links to departmental celebra-
tions.
“When I think of you, the grad-
uates of 2020, the words that come 
to mind are resilience, care for 
each other and for this remark-
able place that we call LSA and 
commitment to your education,” 
Curzan said. “You all have grit and 
you get to know that as you move 
forward.” 
The School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance had a message from Music, 
Theatre & Dance Dean Dave Gier, 
along with an interactive digital 
program showcasing work from 
graduating students. There were 
faculty and alumni congratula-
tions, as well as a performance of 
“The Victors” by graduating musi-
cal theatre students.
The Ross School of Business 
was one of the few groups to hold 
a livestream event in celebration, 
which was recorded and posted for 
those who could not attend live. 
The event was held via Zoom and 
included speakers such as Michi-
gan alum Brad Keywell, founder of 
Groupon.
“We are here as one family, con-
nected, and that’s what really mat-
ters,” Keywell said. “Even though 
we can’t be together in person, 
what we’re doing is reflective of 
the Michigan way. We are taking 
lemons and we are making deli-
cious lemonade.”
Despite all the online content 
and certain departments holding 
live events, there was no holistic 
live component to the commence-
ment celebrations put on by the 
University, which some students 
found disappointing. LSA senior 
Lizzy Irvin viewed some of the 
videos Saturday morning, includ-
ing the video posted by Curzan, 
and planned to watch more of the 
videos with her parents in the eve-
ning.
“I think they did a good job with 
what they covered,” Irvin said. 
“But, I wish there would have been

Remote learning has given all 
University of Michigan students 
the opportunity to take classes 
this spring and summer without 
residing in Ann Arbor. However, 
for Public Health junior Maddie 
Malvitz, that meant 50 students 
in front of her on the waitlist for 
Chem 230. 
Malvitz, on a pre-med track, 
had been planning to take Chem 
230 this spring before COVID-19, 
but since the class has filled for 
both the upcoming spring and fall 
semesters, she had difficulties 
with the rest of her course plan-
ning.
“I emailed Angie Cox (the 
undergraduate program coordi-
nator in chemistry), and she said, 
‘Even if you get on the waitlist 
(for Pchem), you probably won’t 
get into the class because there’s 
50 people ahead of you,’” Malvitz 
said. “I just got into the School of 
Public Health, and I have required 
classes to take (in the winter 
semester) only offered at one time, 
and it’s stressful to fit Pchem in 
with that.”

Malvitz worries that if she can-
not fit Chem 230 into her schedule 
next year, she may have to post-
pone taking the Medical College 
Admission Test and applying to 
medical school.
“There is a lot of planning for 
when people take (the MCAT),” 
Malvitz said. “It just sucks that 
there’s so few options (to take 
Chem 230) and the University 
isn’t able to accommodate your 
classes.”
LSA junior Sesilia Kammo was 
also originally on the Chem 230 
waitlist for the spring, but decided 
to replace the course with Phys-
ics 135 because 34 students were 
ahead of her.
“I definitely think it was a lot 
more stressful because I’ve taken 
STEM classes before and the wait-
lists have never looked like this 
for them,” Kammo said. “I was 
number 35 on the waitlist and it 
wasn’t a very realistic place to be 
in and I’d rather take a class I’m 
more likely to get off the waitlist 
for.”
Students from a variety of 
majors spoke to The Daily about 
facing limited class capacities and 
long waitlists. According to the 
LSA Course Guide for spring and 
summer, EECS 203 has 52 stu-
dents on the waitlist; MATH 214 
has 16 students on the waitlist and 
PHYSICS 235 has 30 students on 
the waitlist, among others. 
LSA junior Ainesh Shintre is 

double majoring in economics and 
film, television and media, and 
planned on taking spring cours-
es for the additional credits he 
needs to graduate on time. Shin-
tre said he was originally wait-
listed for FTVM 352. He said the 
Department of Film, Television 
and Media decided to open a new 
section to accommodate the long 
waitlist.
“The classes just filled up fast-
er than usual,” Shintre said. “… I 
really wanted to take this class 
during this term, so I’m glad they 
opened a new section for us.”
Since classes are conducted 
online, Kammo said it can be dif-
ficult for students to understand 
why courses cannot accommodate 
more students.
“I also don’t know how the 
number of students affects the 
professor and all that,” Kammo 
said. “From the student’s perspec-
tive, it can be hard to understand 
because there is no physical seat 
constraint.”
LSA senior Jonah Eisenberg 
said many students confuse the 
capacity of the class with the 
physical capacity of a lecture hall 
holding a set number of students. 
He said the capacity actually is 
in place for the instructors and 
Graduate Student Instructors to 
have enough time to interact with

O

n Sunday, March 8, Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., held a 
campaign rally on the Diag at 
the University of Michigan in advance 
of the March 10 Michigan primary. 
10,000 people were in attendance at 
the rally, which consisted of speeches 
from local, state and national-level offi-
cials, and finally from Sanders at the 
very end. The content of the speeches 
touched on progressive national issues, 
the Sanders campaign platform and a 
uniform call to action for widespread 
national reform. The speech Sanders 
gave specifically spoke to issues like 
Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, 
eliminating student debt and making 
higher education tuition-free, among 
other topics. Sanders also talked about 
a metaphysical “arc of justice” from 
Civil Rights Activist Reverend Jesse 
Jackson to U.S. Rep. Alexandria Oca-
sio-Cortez, D-N.Y., mentioning that 
many people had been imprisoned or 
had died in the name of “(seeking) jus-
tice.” His speech was revolutionary in 
tone and the content was rife, as you’d 
expect, with emotional and political 
rhetoric that created audible and vis-
ible excitement among his supporters. 
Indeed, the crowd was quick to react 
with cheers when he proclaimed that 
he’d enact socialist policies upon his 
inauguration to the White House. 
I spoke afterward with supporters to 
gauge their impressions of his delivery, 
the overall spectacle of this campaign 
event and of (democratic) socialism 
itself. One supporter, James, said Sand-
ers’ support for the Green New Deal 
won him his support; another sup-
porter (and friend), Humza, pointed to 
Sanders’ advocacy for Medicare for All 

as the central issue that earned him his 
support. These two prospective vot-
ers and vocal Sanders supporters also 
noted that climate change was a big 
motivating issue for them. I also asked 
them about Sanders’ self-proclaimed 
“democratic socialist” moniker: James 
claimed that it shouldn’t be such a scary 
word, and Humza believed that the 
word “socialism” has been contorted 
to such extents that it is now mean-
ingless and means whatever you want 
it to mean. I also asked another friend 
and unabashed Trump supporter, with 
whom I attended the rally, about his 
thoughts on socialism: “I think social-
ism is evil because it deprives individu-
als of the right to own their own labor 
and property, as well as their freedom 
from state-control over their lives.” 
Between this small sample size of 
Sanders and Trump supporters, there 
is a clear disparity on the matter of 
socialism, linguistically and politically. 
Therefore, it is worth examining why 
this ideology appeals so much to young 
people.
A good place to start is the defini-
tion of “socialism.” According to the 
Merriam-Webster dictionary, social-
ism means “any of various economic 
and political theories advocating col-
lective or governmental ownership 
and administration of the means of 
production and distribution of goods.” 
To put it more simply, it means giving 
the government more power. If you ask 
the most famous young socialist in the 
country, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
what it means, however, you’ll receive 
flowery rhetoric in response: “I believe 
that in a modern, moral and wealthy 
society, no person in America should be 

too poor to live.” Socialism is an ideol-
ogy that has historically left millions 
powerless and in poverty to the whims 
of governmental officials: however, 
attach the word “democratic” and it is 
suddenly the mechanism required to 
solve these problems. This conundrum 
begs some questions: Why are so many 
young people — fans of Sanders and 
AOC — attracted to socialism? Is it the 
emotional resonance of instituting a 
top-down effort to alleviate hunger and 
poverty and other societal problems? 
Is it the utopian idealism of universal 
equality that endures despite the his-
torical failures of this ideology? Or does 
some version of youthful ignorance jus-
tify this widespread support for social-
ism? 
Certainly, there’s a romantic quality 
about the concept of institutionalizing 
a system that is fair and equitable, that 
levels the playing field in some man-
ner so that the top 1 percent of 1 per-
cent cannot amass obscene amounts 
of wealth. According to Deidra Nansen 
McCloskey, professor of Economics, 
History, English and Communications 
at the University of Illinois at Chi-
cago, the “romantic ideals” of social-
ism make it a “cherished identity” for 
youth. Young people personally con-
nect to the utopian ethos of socialism 
because it connotes an improvement 
upon society, leaving people better off 
than before.

The temptation of socialism

I 

feel so empty this morning. No 
Zoom meeting with students 
to look forward to, no prepara-
tion. Classes are over.
I had to say goodbye to 55 stu-
dents on Monday and Tuesday, in 
four different classes. I thanked 
them and praised their hard work, 
like I usually do.
I dressed up, put makeup on, did 
my hair, wore my favorite earrings, 
tried to find within me a happy 
face for one last time in front of the 
camera. Days of putting on a smile, 
trying to bring positive energy to a 
virtual class while confronted with 
a full screen of sad faces, tired and 
worried. I wanted to honor them 
one last time. 
At the end of class I told my stu-
dents how proud I was of them for 
showing up to class every day. I con-
gratulated them on finding ways 
to adapt to the craziness, for being 
engaged and connecting with each 
other. I told them, “No one will ever 
forget what you all have been going 
through and everyone will praise 
you for your strength and resilience, 
no matter how big or small. You 
should all be very proud of your-
selves!” I also said I was sad for not 
being able to say goodbye in person, 
in a normal classroom. And some of 
them cried.
At the end of the day, I was 
emotionally drained. I closed my 
computer and started weeping in 
my kitchen for ten long minutes. 
Nothing had prepared me for this — 
never would have I imagined feeling 
so sad on the last day of class. There 
were times in my 23 years of teach-
ing at the University of Michigan 
that were difficult — health strug-
gles, family deaths, catastrophic 
events in the news — but nothing 
had really prepared me for this.
I was on the phone with my 
mother on March 11 when the email 
came out. I had seen my students 
in the classroom that same morn-
ing. I was never going to see them 
again. Although I had expected the 
news, I was shocked by the reality 
of it all and stared at my screen, 
speechless, tears streaming down 
my cheeks, listening to my moth-
er’s comforting words. My children 
witnessed my distress and at that 
moment understood what it meant 
for me to be a teacher.
The following day I started 
running a marathon. Hours of 
daily work, preparation and class 
time. Live sessions with my stu-
dents to keep them engaged and 
speaking French daily. Tons of 
exchanges with colleagues via 
email, BlueJeans meetings, phone 
conversations. A wonderful sense 

of community and collaboration 
emerged but I was feeling lonely 
and lost, afraid of what was coming 
ahead, uncertain about my teach-
ing choices, doubting my ability to 
adjust. The situation was evolving 
on the hour, changes needing to be 
made daily. And yet students were 
showing up to class, doing all the 
work, adapting to their teachers’ 
new technology endeavors, trying 
to make sense out of this new crazy 
normal.
And all of this kept me going. 
Preparing my classes, going to 
workshops, seeing my students 
every day and connecting with 
them virtually kept me sane and 
helped me forget the depressing 
reality. I learned so much about my 
students and about myself through-
out those 40 days.
They 
shared 
their 
personal 
struggles, living situations and 
experiences, their worries and 
fears — I felt very connected to 
them. More than ever. We were far 
apart yet so close.
I lost a lot of control in my teach-
ing and realized it was okay. I could 
not hear and listen to everything 
students were saying and sharing 
in breakout rooms. I will never 
know what really happened in all 
these virtual meetings, but it was 
probably empowering and simply 
reassuring for them to have their 
own private space. I envision that 
a sense of normalcy arose from 
speaking privately to classmates 
once again, even if the conversa-
tions drifted.
I am so thankful I live in a com-
munity that allowed me to teach 
remotely, provided me with the 
needed tools to make a somewhat 
smoother transition and enabled 
me to finish the semester for these 
well-deserving students who I 
will miss deeply. However, I have 
witnessed inequities in students’ 
resources and abilities to stay con-
nected throughout the end of the 
semester. Socioeconomic inequali-
ties have been exacerbated by the 
current situation, not only within 
different regions of Michigan, but 
also in the Ann Arbor area. We 
should all continue to advocate for 
a fair and accessible educational 
system. 
Now I have to let go and conquer 
this void that I feel. I am confident 
I will overcome the sadness and the 
sense of loss. I just need the strength 
to confront the reality around me.

I feel so empty this morning

S

ince the start of the COVID-
19 pandemic, governors have 
had an integral responsibility 
to keep their constituents safe. From 
enacting stay-at-home orders to hold-
ing press conferences and advocat-
ing for their state to receive medical 
equipment, governors are working 
tirelessly to protect their states. While 
some governors, such as New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo, California Gov. Gavin 
Newsom and Ohio Gov. Mike Dewine 
have received glowing praise for their 
actions and leadership, Michigan’s own 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has faced criti-
cism and widespread protests. But this 
radically different reception is not due 
to differences in policy or competency. 
Instead, it is an example of the perva-
sive sexism that exists within our politi-
cal system. 
COVID-19 has forced governors to 
make tough decisions in the name of 
public health. Whitmer has taken a sen-
sible approach with the intent of keep-
ing Michiganders safe. Yes, she has had 
to make the difficult decision to close 
non-essential businesses, schools and 
other facilities, but these closures were 
all to protect the health and safety of 
Michiganders. This was especially 
important given that COVID-19 has 
hit Michigan particularly hard — the 
state has the seventh-largest number of 
cases and the fourth-largest quantity of 
deaths in the country. 
Despite this reasonable approach, 
Whitmer has faced considerable push-
back. Over the past few weeks, there 
have been multiple protests in Lansing. 
The most recent protest consisted of 
heavily-armed protestors who filled the 
Capitol in Lansing and demanded the 
stay-at-home order be lifted. In addition 
to being armed with guns and tactical 
gear, many demonstrators had confed-
erate flags and sexist, inflammatory, 
anti-Whitmer signs. Additionally, the 
Republican state legislature opposed 
Whitmer by refusing to extend the 
disaster declaration. However, she ulti-
mately extended the stay-at-home order 
using her executive power, prompting 
the GOP to threaten a possible lawsuit.
In examining this situation, one 
must ask why Whitmer faces so much 
flack for her actions. The measures that 
she has implemented are not unique 
to Michigan. Across the United States, 
many governors have implemented 
similar stay-at-home orders with simi-
lar restrictions. Clearly, the extreme 
reactions showcased by stay-at-home 
protestors are not about actions and 
instead about the leaders implement-
ing these actions. Whitmer is a strong 
woman who has power that she is not 
afraid to exercise and it is not hard to 
see how her power and poise could be 

threatening to misogynistic and close-
minded individuals. 
This is not the first time that Whit-
mer has faced sexism during this pan-
demic. Sexism was on display in late 
March when President Donald Trump 
referred to Whitmer as “the woman in 
Michigan.” This comment is an obvi-
ous example of the blatant sexism that 
female politicians face. Even if Trump 
had simply forgotten Whitmer’s name, 
he could have referred to her as the 
Governor of Michigan. Instead, he 
decided to assign to her the title of “that 
woman,” refusing to respect her posi-
tion as governor and belittling the work 
she was doing to protect her residents.
This issue of sexism in politics is 
not exclusive to Whitmer. It has been 
a recurring problem throughout the 
country, especially in regards to gov-
ernors’ races. Currently, there are just 
nine female governors in the continen-
tal U.S., a pitiful number considering 
that women make up 50.8 percent of the 
country. Twenty-two states, including 
New York, California and Florida, have 
never had a female governor. The lack 
of female governors can be attributed 
in part to sexism and sexist precon-
ceived notions about women. Gover-
nors are the leaders of their state who 
have tremendous power and author-
ity. Considering the backlash against 
Whitmer, women holding positions of 
authority can disproportionately anger 
people. 
This is not to say that everyone who is 
angry about the stay-at-home orders in 
Michigan is sexist. This is an extremely 
stressful time and, for many communi-
ties that have been relatively spared by 
the virus thus far due to social-distanc-
ing measures, it may seem unnecessary 
to extend such orders. However, think 
about the governors of other states and 
the actions they have taken. If you agree 
with them, but not Whitmer, could this be 
because of the implicit sexist bias against 
female leaders that many of us harbor? 
In this time of great uncertainty, it 
is important that we come together as 
one state and recognize the foremost 
priority of protecting our fellow Michi-
ganders. Whitmer has been doing a tre-
mendous job for the state of Michigan. 
She has stood strong and resilient in the 
face of opposition in order to protect the 
health and safety of all of us. She should 
be lauded for her work just as we have 
lauded male governors across the coun-
try. This column is not about shaming 
others — instead, it is a call to action for 
all of us to recognize the biases that we 
carry and how they impact the percep-
tions of our leaders. 

Sexism in the age of coronavirus

A

s many states begin 
the 
difficult 
task 
of 
reopening 
after 
weeks of shutdowns to fight 
the spread of COVID-19, it’s 
become painfully clear that 
life will be anything but nor-
mal as we adjust to a “new 
normal.” 
Across the country, college 
campuses may remain closed 
into the fall, with University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel remarking that fall 
2020 is “unlikely to be a nor-
mal semester.” Millions of 
American workers have lost 
their jobs and countless small 
businesses will be confronted 
with the difficult decision to 
shut down. Meanwhile, new 
estimates suggest that the 
threat posed by COVID-19 
— which has now killed over 
70,000 Americans — is going 
nowhere.
But as Americans look for-
ward to the dismal future, 
good is coming out of this 
nightmarish pandemic. Coun-
tries across the world are 
intelligently emerging from 
COVID-19 with new ways of 
life and new ways of doing 
things that will make societ-
ies better places in general. 
Here in the United States, as 
we begin to make our difficult 
journey back to whatever new 
normal will await us, we have 
a lot of work ahead of us. But 
there’s one goal in particular 
that we must put at the top of 
our list: ending our dangerous 
dependence on China.
Since 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
was 
first 
elected 
almost four years ago, he has 
stressed time after time that 
our nation is far too reliant 
on a country halfway across 
the globe. With a population 
of 1.4 billion people, China 
has different goals, different 
interests and different ways 
of governing. Since COVID-
19 first emerged from the 
Chinese city of Wuhan and 
quickly paralyzed the world, 
many have started to believe 
the president and realize the 
inherent danger in depending 
on China — a great economic 
rival and American adversary 
— to produce American goods 
and control supply chains. It’s 
perfectly fine to be friendly 
with China and forge eco-
nomic alliances where appro-

priate, but as evidenced by 
COVID-19, America desper-
ately needs to be able to stand 
on its own.
For years before the COVID-
19 crisis, China increasing-
ly gained control over our 
products, supply chains and 
industries, tightening its grip 
on American life and mak-
ing us more dependent on its 
authoritarian 
regime 
than 
ever before. With promises of 
lenient regulation and cheap 
labor, American businesses 
have been flocking to China 
for 
decades, 
manufactur-
ing products overseas at the 
expense of American econom-
ic progress.

If the perils of our reliance 
on China weren’t clear a few 
months ago, they are pain-
fully obvious today. In the 
worst moments of our battle 
against COVID-19, we have 
been constantly reminded of 
our 
dangerous 
dependence 
on Beijing. While most didn’t 
bother to consider this before 
the pandemic, the produc-
tion of common pharmaceu-
tical drugs Americans need 
is controlled almost entirely 
by China. In 2019, accord-
ing to the U.S. Department 
of Commerce, 95 percent of 
U.S. imports of ibuprofen are 
from China. Meanwhile, 70 
percent of U.S. imports of 
acetaminophen, along with 
over 40 percent of imported 
penicillin, 
originates 
from 
China. According to a recent 
Politico article, “A watchdog 
report last month by the U.S.-
China Economic and Security 
Review Commission and a 
recent congressional hearing 
warn that China hopes of sur-
passing the United States as 
the world’s biggest producer 
of pharmaceutical products.” 
Additionally, FDA inspections 
of one drug production plant 
in Anyang, China, two years 
ago 
revealed 
“significant 

deviations from current good 
manufacturing practice.”
If China’s near-total control 
of our medications doesn’t 
trouble you in the midst of 
an unprecedented global pan-
demic — when we need reli-
able medicine more than ever 
— there’s more. As I detailed 
in a recent column, one of the 
largest reasons this pandemic 
has proven so disruptive for 
Americans is because of our 
lack of personal protective 
equipment or essential medi-
cal equipment, such as N95 
masks or ventilators. What is 
becoming more clear as we 
emerge from COVID-19 is that 
China is directly responsible 
for much of our trouble obtain-
ing this vital medical equip-
ment. In a recent interview, 
White House trade adviser 
Peter Navarro said that China 
“cornered” the production of 
PPE during the pandemic and 
has since “profiteered” from 
its actions.
More 
than 
ever 
before, 
the COVID-19 pandemic has 
made clear that our increasing 
dependence on China is com-
pletely unacceptable. As we 
continue to invest in Chinese 
progress instead of our own, 
we continue to put ourselves 
at a profound economic risk, 
not to mention the dangerous 
medical implications of our 
reliance on China. 
Beyond the direct impacts of 
American reliance on China dur-
ing COVID-19, which gave way 
to severe medical supply short-
ages, our willingness to lean on 
Beijing has produced a cascade 
of risks that will stay with us 
until we are able to stand on our 
own. If the COVID-19 pandemic 
doesn’t convince us to change 
our ways now, China will con-
tinue to stand in the way of our 
health, economic progress and 
national security.
At a time when we are begin-
ning to live life again, emerging 
from our homes and trying to 
adjust to normalcy after weeks 
in quarantine, it’s time to begin 
supporting American interests 
and progress immediately. Now, 
more than ever before, it’s urgent 
that we take COVID-19 as a les-
son and end China’s chokehold 
on our great nation.

It’s time to end American reliance on China

This piece is part of a series on 
“Art during COVID,” an explora-
tion of art forms to keep our idle 
minds creative during this pan-
demic. With many of us at home, 
our minds have ample time to 
wander, wonder, and create. 
This series highlights accessible 
and immersive art forms to both 
produce and consume during the 
pandemic months and beyond.
My favorite time to be outside 
is right before a storm. I watch 
the masses of clouds turning 
dark gray, the tree branches 
dancing, the ground whispering 
through the wind and I want to 
be right there when the antici-
pation finally spills over. It’s the 
first chapter of a story waiting 
to unfold. When the thunder 
and lighting do come crashing 
down, it’s as if the earth is tell-
ing us to pay attention.
On one particular Novem-
ber evening, when I was still in 
Ann Arbor, I had a friend come 
over for dinner. Toward the end 
of our meal, I sensed a storm 
coming and urged him to walk 
back to his house before it hit. 
He said he’d rather wait until it 
did come and then walk back in 
the torrents of rain, just to feel 
the drops hitting his skin. “The 
rain is warm when it’s storm-
ing outside,” he said. It seemed 
so simple to just let the drops 
hit you instead of seeking shel-
ter under hoods and umbrellas. 
I wondered why I didn’t try it 
more often.
In my eyes, this pandemic is 
just another storm, a momen-
tary pause that forces us to 
listen and pay attention to our 
surroundings. My last days in 

Ann Arbor before moving back 
home held the same eerie calm 
reserved for those moments 
before a downpour. And just like 
the worst hurricanes, I remind 
myself that this storm will also 
pass. While we’re stuck in this 
intermittent and uncertain time, 
the outdoors, already my solace, 
has become my everyday refuge. 
With it has come the conviction 
that our surroundings are more 
than just a place to be active or 
escape from the indoors. The 
spring terrain is overflowing 
with life and this pandemic is a 
wonderful time to experiment 
with environmental art. 
As we wallow away in our 
homes, the earth appears to 
be rebounding. On my walk 
through 
the 
neighborhood 
today, I heard a woodpecker 
chipping away at an empty tree 
hollow, a blue jay perched on the 
uppermost branches of an east-
ern white pine and a dashing red 
cardinal hidden in a bush. The 
fleeting memory of a red winged 
blackbird I saw two weeks ago, 
swaying on the top of a wetland 
reed, still tugs at my conscious-
ness. A robin has made a nest 
in my crabapple tree and the 
chicks are nearly ready to take 
flight, flapping their wings fero-
ciously. The world is oblivious 
to the affairs of humans, likely 
happy to be undisturbed at last.
Sitting on my driveway, let-
ting the sun warm my feet, has 
become my daily routine of 
seeing the world in a different 
perspective. Try planting your-
self at ground level and sketch-
ing what’s in front of you, big 
or small. Sitting close to the 
earth is humbling — it reminds 
us of our roots and our destina-
tion, our link between life and 
death. Remind yourself that 
your creation doesn’t have to be 

perfect, because your surround-
ings aren’t. There are rarely any 
straight lines in trees or sym-
metrical leaves on branches. 
If you’re hesitant to sketch 
from scratch, collect branches, 
flowers and shrubs and use 
them as a template to outline 
your shapes. I like to become 
my own ecologist and create 
field guides in this way, creat-
ing entries for different trees 
or flowers that I encounter. I 
plan to revisit my failed goal of 
last summer — to create a book 
of Michigan trees using pens 
and watercolor. I live in one of 
the flattest suburbs of metro-
Detroit, but even my neighbor-
hood lends itself to projects 
like these. Local trails, state 
and metro parks, many free of 
admission during the pandemic, 
are wonderful spaces to draw 
inspiration from as well.
Creating a time lapse of your 
surroundings, through paint or 
pencils or photos, can capture 
the moments of beauty even in 
the midst of a pandemic. My 
focus has been the robin nest in 
my crabapple tree that I spot-
ted a month ago. Now, the three 
siblings have nearly outgrown 
their home. During cold spells, 
I watch the mother robin sit 
on top of her nest, covering the 
chicks to protect them from the 
rain that shakes the tree. During 
the bright daylight, the chicks 
crane their necks for food. I’ve 
taken to creating miniature 
watercolor paintings of the 
robin nest at these various stag-
es, trying to capture the brilliant 
blue of the eggs and the burnt 
orange of the mother’s belly 
through paint.

On environmental art

If you’ve spent any 
substantial amount of 
time 
worrying 
about 
lofty questions like the 
meaning of life, human-
ity’s purpose, or any-
thing else you’d hesitate 
to bring up on a first 
date, then go watch 
“The Midnight Gospel” 
right now. This show is 
so weird and interesting 
that I wouldn’t want to 
deprive anyone of the 
experience of going into 
it blind. Just prepare 
some snacks, block out 
three hours, load up on 
your illicit substance 
of choice and enjoy the 
ride.
For the more skep-
tical, 
“The 
Midnight 
Gospel” is an animated 
TV show created by 
Duncan Trussell and 
“Adventure Time” cre-
ator Pendleton Ward. 
It’s set in a strange 
dimension called “The 
Chromatic Ribbon” and 
follows Clancy (Dun-
can Trussell), as he 
uses his universe simu-
lator to travel to other 
worlds and interview a 
new guest for his space-
cast 
(space 
podcast) 
each episode. Most of 
the interview dialogue 
is pulled from Trus-
sell’s 
actual 
podcast, 
“The 
Duncan 
Trus-
sell Family Hour.” This 
means that the show is 
essentially Trussell as 
Clancy interviewing a 
real podcast guest as a 
made up podcast guest, 
but neither Trussell nor 
his real guest know that 
they’ll 
be 
portraying 
characters at the time 
of recording. This puts 
the creators in an odd 
position: it’s almost like 
they’re making a found 
footage 
film. 
Hav-
ing watched the show 
without knowing it was 
based on a podcast, the 
dialogue is integrated 

into the story well 
enough that I never felt 
anything off about it.
Each episode wastes 
no time tackling all 
sorts of profound exis-
tential questions. The 
conversations 
hap-
pen while the guest is 
absent-mindedly 
com-
pleting some bizarre, 
action-packed task. The 
first 
episode 
begins 
with Clancy traveling 
to a version of Earth in 
the midst of a zombie 
apocalypse. 
His 
con-
sciousness is shot into 
space, landing on Earth 
in front of the White 
House, where a group of 
protesters are advocat-
ing for legalized mari-
juana 
as 
everything 
around them deterio-
rates into a warzone. He 
happens to land directly 
on the president (Dr. 
Drew Pinskey, “Love-
line”) of this version of 
the United States, who 
agrees to be interviewed 
for the spacecast. They 
quickly 
get 
into 
an 
insightful conversation 
about the benefits and 
dangers of marijuana 
and other drugs, touch-
ing on mental health, 
addiction, and philoso-
phy. This, again, all hap-
pens under imminent 
threat of an apocalypse. 
The President will, for 
example, be making a 
nuanced point about the 
medicinal properties of 
marijuana while non-
chalantly shooting at 
zombies from the roof of 
the White House. Every 
episode is structured 
similarly, each ending 
with the world Clancy 
visits being destroyed as 
he safely returns home.
The 
show 
cen-
ters itself around this 
irony—the 
tension 
between abstract phi-
losophizing 
and 
real 
action in a world that’s 
fallen into chaos. It 
manifests itself not only 
in the worlds Clancy 
visits, but also his own 

life. As the show pro-
gresses, we start to 
see Clancy’s tendency 
towards escapism. He 
devotes all his attention 
to his spacecast while 
ignoring pressing issues 
in his own life. He’ll 
routinely discuss with 
guests the importance 
of 
kindness, 
forgive-
ness, and living in the 
moment, 
while 
com-
pletely 
disregarding 
these principles when 
he’s back home. The 
juxtaposition 
between 
the 
casual 
conversa-
tions and the chaotic 
environments in which 
they take place mirrors 
Clancy’s own inner con-
flict, and we see this 
play out in increasingly 
outlandish ways. “The 
Midnight 
Gospel” 
is 
full of irony, but never 
mocks the ironic situa-
tion in the way a show 
like “South Park” might. 
Instead it attempts to 
earnestly reconcile the 
contradiction in a way 
that’s funny and sin-
cere. 
The art style of “The 
Midnight 
Gospel” 
takes cues from Ward’s 
“Adventure Time.” Each 
object in a given scene 
looks a bit otherworldly. 
Whether it’s a fish with 
a human face, a dog-hip-
po hybrid, or a cult-like 
crew of feline servants, 
strange 
images 
satu-
rate every scene, form-
ing a captivating and 
disorienting composite. 
Meanwhile, Clancy and 
his guest take part in a 
conversation that seems 
at first profound, but 
pales in comparison to 
the wondrousness going 
on around them. This 
setup invites viewers 
to pay attention to the 
wonder they might be 
ignoring in their own 
lives while reinforcing 
the ironic tension of the 
story.

Netflix’s catalogue hosts a large 
range of teenage romantic com-
edies, films usually based on arche-
types who parrot dumbed-down 
lines about the “important” parts of 
high school without experiencing a 
lot of character growth. They’re 
short and predictable, and because 
their sole purpose is entertain-
ment, they start to blur together. 
But when a teen film goes beyond 
simple entertainment, it stands out. 
This is what makes Netflix’s latest 
teen movie, “The Half of It,” so spe-
cial and important: it takes the typ-
ical teen movie format and turns it 
into something more.
“The Half of It” seems like some-
thing we’ve heard before. It’s set 
in a small town in the USA, where 
people know of each other without 
ever really knowing each other. 
The community values religion and 
conventionality; those who stand 
out are frowned upon. Ellie Chu 
(Leah Lewis, “Nancy Drew”) is a 
classic fish out of water, closed off 
to her classmates who she struggles 
to connect with. After some push-
back, she agrees to help Paul Mun-
sky (Daniel Diemer, “Sacred Lies”), 
a sweet, simple boy, write a love let-
ter to Aster Flores (Alexxis Lemire, 
“The Art of Murder”), a classic far-
away crush. Despite her own grow-
ing feelings for Aster, Ellie helps 
Paul try to impress Aster through 
the power of language and under-
standing, and all three go through 
a journey of connection that chal-
lenges their perceptions.
But even with the background of 

mild catfishing, there’s a lot about 
this film that is new: most impor-
tantly, representation. Ellie is a 
character we don’t see enough of in 
films and television: Whip-smart 
and musically talented, but also 
multi-faceted and introspective. 
She’s one of the only people of color 
in her small town, and she speaks 
Mandarin at home with her father 
Edwin (Collin Chou, “The Matrix 
Reloaded”), whose struggles with 
English have led to struggles with 
employment. Ellie is well-read, and 
her way with words has led to her 
prolific 
essay-writing 
business. 
She’s shamelessly intelligent (other 
than the fact that she only charges 
$10 for a three-page essay), but 

she’s always felt like the odd one 
out in her hometown, whether it’s 
because of her race, intelligence, 
sexuality or all of the above.
The film struggles with pac-
ing at times, where time feels a bit 
too fluid. A lot of things seem to 
happen in a short amount of time, 
and parts of the story become 
confused and chaotic. That said, 
watching Ellie shed her walls and 
open up to people is wonderful to 
watch. Ellie and Paul connect over 
cram sessions, old movies and fur-
tive meetings despite being polar 
opposites. Ellie is mature for her 
age and brusque with anyone who 
isn’t her father. Paul is the classic 
lovable dope, who claims to be bad 

with words but occasionally drops 
gems like, “Isn’t that what love is? 
How much effort you put into lov-
ing someone?” Despite being the 
subject of a love triangle and occa-
sionally seeming a bit too good to be 
true, Aster is refreshingly fleshed-
out; Aster and Ellie’s connection as 
they ponder life and love is undeni-
able, even if Aster doesn’t know the 
truth of who’s writing the letters. 
The connections between charac-
ters are the heart of the story. Ellie 
and Aster connect over their love of 
literature and feeling out of place. 
Paul and Ellie’s dad connect over 
their struggle to articulate their 
thoughts into words. And Ellie and 
Paul connect over the simple mat-
ter of having someone to talk to and 
ponder their place in the world.
“The Half of It” is a teen movie 
that defies the genre. Regardless 
of any issues with pacing, the story 
created by director/screenwriter 
Alice Wu (“Saving Face”) is unique-
ly real and relatable. It’s a story that 
deals with conflict, whether it’s the 
reconciliation of beliefs or dealing 
with the subtle racism of being one 
of the only people of color in a small 
town. It’s an LGBTQ story that 
hinges on identity that doesn’t feel 
strong armed or unrealistic. The 
colors of the setting may be muted, 
but the language of the script is 
beautiful and vibrant, with lines 
that you want to hold close and 
moments that come satisfyingly 
full-circle. The film is not exactly a 
romance, but it is a film about love 
in various forms, about friendship 
and connection and finding the 
people that make you feel more 
complete.

FILM REVIEW
FILM REVIEW

Netflix

You’ve got three big reasons to 
revisit 2014 sci-fi epic “Snowpierc-
er.” Firstly, as is the raison d’etre 
of this notebook series, movies to 
do with the apocalypse are pretty 
timely right now. Secondly, it’s 
directed by none other than Bong 
Joon-ho, whose Oscar domination 
this past February was so iconoclas-
tic and bombastic that conserva-
tive South Korean politicians who 
once vilified him as unpatriotic and 
“Parasite” as a “commie flick” are 
now proposing building a statue 
and museum in honor of Bong in his 
hometown of Daegu. Oh, and third-
ly, it’s on Netflix.
Admittedly, for an entry in a 
series titled “Scenes from an Apoc-
alypse,” 
“Snowpiercer” 
doesn’t 
contain that many scenes from an 
apocalypse. The disembodied voic-
es of pre-apocalyptic newscasters 
exposit about pre-apocalyptic poli-
tics. A trio of planes jettison a nox-
ious-looking white substance into 
the atmosphere. And that’s about 
it. The rest of the film fast-forwards 
17 years to a Snowball Earth and a 
“rattling ark,” the eponymous train 
Snowpiercer.
In post-apocalyptic films like 
“Nausicaä of the Valley of the 
Wind,” the apocalypse is ancient 
history. In “The Road,” it’s a more or 
less irrelevant detail given the ata-
vistic dog-eat-dog circumstances. 
In “Children of Men,” the catalyst 
for the film’s sterilizing dooms-
day is entirely unknown. But in 
“Snowpiercer,” it’s all spelled out: it 
was us. No two ways about it. First 
humankind polluted the heck out of 
the world and threw the climate all 
out of whack. Then, in an attempt to 
reverse what we did, 79 countries 
shot some sort of cooling agent into 
the sky, causing the entire planet to 
freeze over and all life to be extin-
guished. That is, all life without the 
good fortune to a receive a ticket to 
board the train.
The coronavirus pandemic has 
thrust us uncomfortably close 
to an apocalypse film. We have 
a deadly virus and incompetent 
governments. We have guns sales 
skyrocketing as people prepare 
for the worst. We even have some 

people talking about stringing up 
their neighbors and “eating ass” 
… and no, not as a sex thing. One 
thing maintaining that thin separa-
tion between reality and the silver 
screen is the movies’ failure to pre-
dict that some people would protest 
their right to get eaten by the zom-
bies. Truth is truly stranger than 
fiction.
But what “Snowpiercer” reminds 
us is that, before the pandemic 
forced the impoverished to starve 
and the more well-off to bake bread, 
we were already in the middle of an 
apocalypse, albeit one that moves 
at a much slower pace (hint: it’s the 
climate crisis) and that the dystopia 
may already be here (hint: it’s capi-
talism).
The passengers of “Snowpiercer” 
aren’t all grateful to have gotten 
the golden ticket to circumnavigate 
the globe for the remainder of their 
lives. Some no doubt are — the pas-
sengers who live near the front of 
the train enjoy steak dinners, bath-
houses, nightclubs, string quartets 
and even sushi twice a year. For 
the ones who live near the caboose, 
it’s the Polar Express from hell, but 
they don’t even get Tom Hanks. 
One character describes the first 
few months aboard the train, when 
there were too many mouths and 
not enough food. Miraculously, like 
the fish and loaves of the Bible, a 
veritable cornucopia was produced: 
“One by one, other people in the tail 
section began cutting off arms and 
legs and offering them.”
Instead, they have Chris Evans, 
starring in the film only two years 
after his debut as the exuberantly 
optimistic, muscle-bound Captain 
America. In “Snowpiercer,” Evans 
dons a woolen cap, scruffy beard 
and world-weary face as Curtis, 
the leader of a revolution. With his 
second-in-command Edgar (Jamie 
Hill, “Rocketman”), grieving moth-
er Tanya (Octavia Spencer, “Ma”), 
security specialist and drug addict 
Nam (Song Kang-ho, “Parasite”) 
and Nam’s clairvoyant daughter 
Yona (Go Ah-yung “A Resistance”), 
Curtis must travel the length of the 
train from the tail-end all the way to 
the near-mythical engine in order 
to pursue justice and enact reform.

How four men fill the racial gap 
where the institution fails

Societal consequences of the 
COVID-19 pandemic have entirely 
altered the world of academica. 
This speaks to the way of life for all 
students, but particularly students 
of color and underrepresented 
students with fewer resources 
to accomplish their educational 
goals, or even go to class. However, 
these racial and class disparities in 
education are present throughout 
all of history, and yet there exists 
no functioning resolution within 
the institution.
“Those 
that 
have 
raised 
graduation rates for low-income 
students have often relied on 
wraparound services, addressing 
the needs of the whole student,” 
Vimal Patel, senior reporter for The 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 
wrote “That includes caring for 
their financial and mental health, 
and creating a network of support 
with cohorts, early interventions 
and extra counseling. A ‘high 
touch’ learning environment, as 
many advocates call it.” 
On 
March 
20th, 
local 
organization Building Successful 
Bridges announced on Instagram 
a project in which they would offer 

$200 to 5 different University of 
Michigan students to aid their 
transition 
back 
home 
amidst 
the hectic rise of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The genesis of Building 
Successful Bridges first began in 
2016 when incoming freshmen 
Kingsley 
Enechukwu, 
Darrell 
Tubbs and Nando Felten and 
nearly ten other young black men 
connected over their noticeable 
detachment from the educational 
and 
professional 
development 
which 
had 
been 
abundantly 
provided to their new peers. Soon 
after, the official team and founders 
would be LSA students Tubbs 
and Felten, and Ross students 
Enechukwu and Kendall Van Allen. 
“We all had similar experiences 
in the sense that our school didn’t 
really 
prepare 
us 
for 
college 
and the transition to college, or 
[teach us] ultimately how to be 
successful 
there,” 
Enechukwu 
said. “This was the beginning of 
Boys Seeking Billions which sought 
to provide success coaching to 
underrepresented minorities and 
communities to ultimately give 
them the tool kit to enter high 
paying industries.”

XOXO, a not so white Gossip Girl

KAREN RASKIND
MiC Blogger

Even 
before 
quarantine, 
I 
consumed a lot of media content 
everyday. 
From 
Instagram 
to 
Netflix binge-watching, I have 
spent 
unimaginable 
hours 
mindlessly scrolling. I bet that 
accounts for a lot of college 
students, as social media platforms 
and Netflix serve as a distraction 
or a way to unwind from the 
stressors of daily life. However, 
I think especially during these 
times of social distancing and 
quarantine, we cannot ignore how 
the media can contribute to body 
and image insecurities due to the 
sheer amount of content we are 
consuming and, overall, the severe 
lack of representation which comes 
with it. 
Like a lot of young girls, I used 

to be (and still am) obsessed with 
“Gossip Girl.” When you’re only 
thirteen or fourteen watching this 

show, you have these fantasies 
about being like Serena or Blair 
and having their impeccable style. 

I thought they were so beautiful 
and definitely tried to take some 
inspiration from them. 

What I didn’t acknowledge, 
however, is that by trying to be 
like them, I was basically trying 
to uncover the more white part 
of me. Being half-Asian and half-
white, I always felt some pressure 
to decide which identity I was 
going to embrace, and felt a little 
self-conscious about my Asian side 
growing up. I would deny that part 
of my identity, saying things like, 
“I’m ‘not that Asian,’” or “I’m ‘fake 
Asian.’” To be honest, I also felt 
like it was easier and, quite frankly, 
better to be white. And seeing 
Leighton Meester and Blake Lively 
nearly four hours a day on TV only 
affirmed that I should definitely 
embrace the white side because 
they were what I began to associate 
with beauty.

An immigrant’s 
Pursuit of ‘Happyness’

MiC Columnist

On May 1, Netflix released a bildungsro-
man film entitled “Half of It,” written and 
directed by Alice Wu, who is known for her 
previous film, “Saving Face,” which is also 
known for its Asian-American and LGBTQ+ 
representation. The narrative of the film fol-
lows the “Cyrano de Bergerac” storyline, as 
Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis) is a senior in high 
school in the small rural town of Squaha-
mish, who runs an essay writing business. 
She is approached by Paul Munsky (Daniel 
Diemer), a kind-hearted football player, who 
doesn’t have a way with words and requests 
her help writing a love letter to popular 
sweetheart, Aster Flores (Alexxis Lemire). 
To be frank, Netflix has produced very 
poor romantic films when carrying the goal 
of representation, such as having a catfished 
romance story with a plus-sized protagonist, 
“Sierra Burgess is a Loser,” but I gave the 
company a pass when “To All the Boys I’ve 
Loved Before,” was released as it featured 
the half-Asian character to be the one fought 
for in a love story. 
However, after watching Wu’s master-
piece, I have come to realize my affinity for 
“To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” is shal-
low, as it is an ideallic, heterosexual, white-
washed fantasy in which I could relate to in 
no manner, besides the small axes of similar-
ity between half of the protagonist’s ethnic-
ity and mine.
Asians are rarely seen on the movie screen 
and when they are, they are portrayed with 
stereotypically Asian attributes, which tend 
to make up their identity, who they are and 
what role they play in the film. All of which 
is why I tricked myself into loving movies 

“Don’t ever let somebody tell you you 
can’t do something. Not even me... You got a 
dream, you gotta protect it. People can’t do 
something themselves, they wanna tell you 
you can’t do it. If you want something, go get 
it.”
“Pursuit of Happyness” has always been 
one of my favorite films. Chris Gardner’s 
determination to earn a better life for his 
family inspires me to never give up on my 
dreams and the sacrifices he makes for his 
son never fail to make me cry. Since I first 
watched this movie I felt a strong connection 
to Gardner’s story, but it wasn’t until recent-
ly, when I revisited “Pursuit of Happyness” 
with my mom and dad, that I realized why it 
provokes me to feel the way I do. 
My mother immigrated to America when 
she was 22. After surviving years of civil 
wars, bombings, homelessness and extreme 
poverty in Lebanon she decided that if she 
ever wanted to have kids, they couldn’t live a 
life like hers. This decision meant she would 
have to leave her entire life behind — her 
family, her friends, her education and her 
career goals — all so the kids she imagined 
having could live a better life. She made this 
decision while aware of its consequences. 
She knew what it was like to have the sound 
of bombs in the morning replace the sound of 
an alarm clock buzzing and didn’t want her 
children to know that feeling. She knew what 
it was like to sleep on the floor in an aban-
doned school because the homeless shelter 
she previously lived in had been bombed. 
She didn’t want her children to go to bed 
each night wondering where tomorrow’s bed 

would be. My mother’s pursuit of happiness 
was in giving her kids a better life than her 
own. A life in which survival was not their 
priority.
My father emigrated from Lebanon to 
America when he was six years old. His 
father found a job in an assembly line at 
the Chrysler Motor Company and he toiled 
away each day trying to make ends meet. 
Even with all this, my grandfather’s job 
was not enough to support his eight kids, 
so my father had to work at a young age. As 
a 12-year-old, he spent his weekends land-
scaping his neighbors’ lawns, his evenings 
working at a pizza shop and his mornings 
distributing leaflets throughout his neigh-
borhood. My father knew what it was like to 
live an impoverished life and he didn’t want 
his children to know that life. He knew what 
it was like to have the responsibility of pro-
viding for your family before reaching your 
teenage years and he didn’t want his chil-
dren to feel that burden. He spent the first 20 
years of his life saving money from various 
minimum wage jobs and when he met my 
mom, he made the brave decision to go to law 
school with a weekly salary of $100 in hopes 
of establishing a successful career so that his 
children would live a life far from his own. 
My father’s pursuit of happiness was in giv-
ing his kids a better life than his own. A life 
in which survival was not their priority. 
My parents have sacrificed so much for my 
siblings and me. My mother left her entire 
life behind and moved to a different country 
while my father worked endlessly, trying to 
escape the shackles of poverty. Whenever I 
watch Chris Gardner in “Pursuit of Happy-
ness,” I am reminded of my parent’s strug-
gles.

who threw me a bone in regards to Asian-
American representation—there is no range 
of selection for me to choose from—and so I 
settle with what I can get, to the point where 
I allowed tokenism to make me believe Hol-
lywood was finally changing. And it was Wu 
who shattered my low expectations. 
I was tired of constantly seeing the dorky, 
quiet or overly-achieving Asian because that 
is all viewers see them as, no depth or deep-
er understanding. But this movie and Ellie 
Chu were a breath of fresh air, because even 
though Ellie is indeed quiet and reserved, 
this stems from her character and storyline 
rather than her racial profile. More than 
that, Ellie is an intelligent and beautiful 
writer, who is stuck in Squahamish with 
her father who is still ridden with grief from 
the passing of his late wife. Another aspect 
of her growth is this relationship between 
her unemployed-immigrant father and the 
adversity he experiences due to language 
barriers. 
But the crucial and integral observation I 
made is that Ellie being Asian doesn’t have 
any impact whatsoever on the movie’s plot. It 
shapes dialogue and how characters interact 
with each other, but her ethnic background 
doesn’t play a role in her relationships or 
the ups and downs of her character. That 
being said, the movie also doesn’t shy away 
from who Ellie is. There are subtle notes of 
how her identity impacts her character from 
other white protagonists, as there are school 
bullies who make fun of her last name, cook-
ing scenes of Chinese cuisine, conversations 
with her father who doesn’t speak fluent 
English, or even when Paul’s mother calls 
her his “Asian friend.”

Adrien Nunez’ battle back to relevance

Last season, on Nov. 12, Adrien 
Nunez was thrown to the wolves.
Following a wrist injury to 
freshman phenom Franz Wagner, 
Nunez — a sophomore that barely 
sniffed the floor the season prior — 
was thrust into a starting position.
A guard with daunting range and 
3-point shooting ability, Nunez was 
billed as a solid force in Michigan’s 
offense throughout his career. It was 
the other side of his game, though, 
that left people worrying
From 
the 
early 
minutes 
of 
Nunez’s tenure as a member of the 
starting squad, this flaw became 
widely apparent — perhaps at no 
more obvious moment than in mid-
November, his second start, against 
the Bluejays.
The game began with both teams 
sporting young rosters and nobody 
really knowing what to expect, but 
Creighton set an aggressive tone 
early and targeted Nunez.
Bluejay guard Mitch Ballock sat at 
the top of the key with the ball in his 
hands and Nunez across from him. 
Ballock drove to the hoop. It would be 
the ultimate test of Nunez’s on-ball 
defense, less than a minute into his 
starting role.
Ballock sped past Nunez and got 
an easy two points at the rim.
“(Ballock) blew by me, and I was 
like, ‘Oh, snap. I need to get this 
together,’” Nunez told The Daily. 
“That was the moment I was like, ‘Oh, 
I really need to work on this.’ Just 
getting comfortable in that position.”
From that point on, Nunez’s battle 
with defensive consistency proved to 
be an arduous one.
The rest of the season, Nunez’s 
defense — among other things — did 
not improve to the point where he 
would see consistent minutes for the 
Wolverines. 
As the games left in the regular 
season dwindled down, so did 
Nunez’s 
playing 
time. 
Wagner 
returned to the lineup and Nunez 
returned to the bench. Some games, 
Nunez would only see a handful 
of minutes, playing the role of an 
offensive 
specialist. 
Others, 
he 
wouldn’t see the floor at all.
“Yeah, it’s tough, it’s a change, 
going from nothing to a lot to not 
a lot again,” Nunez said on Jan. 8. 
“I’m just working everyday. Working 
before or after, gaining (coach Juwan 
Howard’s) trust to really put me on 
the court.”
Nunez took it in stride, though, 
not allowing himself to fold in 

frustration.
Howard saw potential in Nunez. 
The kind of potential that makes 
a coach dig to find the crux of his 
player’s deficiencies and hammer out 
inconsistencies. In Howard’s mind, 
the best way to dow that came during 
particular drills in practice.
Unlike other coaches Nunez has 
played under, Howard’s mentality on 
how to run drills in practice is simple: 
You run it until you get it right.
“That was a big thing,” Nunez 
said. “He made sure I was getting it. 
For some coaches, if a player doesn’t 
get it the first time or second time, 
they move on, but … I could mess 
up 10 times, he’d make me do it over 
and over and over again until I got 
it, which showed how committed he 
was to getting me better.”
“That was a big aspect, and it’s 
a big trust thing with coach now 
because I know he’s invested in me. 
He’s gonna stop practice for me just 
so I can get the drill.”
Nunez wasn’t the only player 
singled out like this, and some take 
to it more than others. Sometimes, 
it can fan the flames of that player’s 
frustrations and insecurities. For 
others, though, this crucible of 
performance shores up faith in the 
coach and their aptitude for the 
team’s array of concepts.
“I want to be coached,” Nunez 
said. “I’m not gonna shy away from 
that, and I feel like that is a good 
quality to have, just wanting to be 
coached. … There are definitely guys 
who will get frustrated when he 
would, not pick on you, but make you 
do the drill over and over again.”
Nunez used his coachability as his 
north star throughout the season, 
and eventually that guiding light 
led him into Howard’s office at the 
beginning of February. Between the 
repeated drills and lack of consistent 
play and playing time, something still 
wasn’t clicking for Nunez.
He needed help. Enter associate 
head coach Phil Martelli.
Martelli is a veteran coach that 
spent 24 years as the head coach of 
St. Joseph’s. Initially sorted into one 
of five players Martelli was tasked 
with keeping track of academically, 
Nunez had already established a 
rapport with him, one stretching 
back to Martelli’s initial recruitment 
of Nunez in high school.
But after discussing how he can 
improve with Howard, the pair 
struck up a new kind of relationship. 
One based on growth and film study.
Jenny Lessard — Nunez’s mother 
— knew her son and Martelli’s paths 
would cross again. She just knew it.

Through much of his senior 
season at Bishop Loughlin High 
School in Brooklyn, NY, Martelli 
made his recruitment of Nunez to St. 
Joe’s personal. Through one stretch 
the summer before the guard’s senior 
year, Martelli visited 13 of Nunez’s 
games in a row. He wanted him in 
Philadelphia, bad.
Then, Nunez broke the news to 
the veteran coach: he wouldn’t be 
coming to the City of Brotherly Love, 
instead pursuing a postgraduate year 
at St. Thomas More Prep School in 
pursuit of other offers. 
Nunez had moved on from the 
Hawks, but that didn’t stop Lessard 
from 
texting 
Martelli 
with 
a 
seemingly divine piece of foresight — 
“Our paths will cross again.”
With an extra year, Nunez’s 
recruitment took off and he secured 
an offer from coach John Beilein. 
Two years later, Nunez and Martelli 
reunited in Ann Arbor, continuing 
the relationship forged in Brooklyn. 
“I recruited (Nunez) very hard 
coming out of high school, it was just 
a joy,” Martelli said. “It was ingenious 
by coach Howard to put us together, 
not that the other guys would’ve done 
just as well, but we were in a good 
place starting out. There was a trust 
there.”
That progress started with Nunez 
making one simple concession: He 
didn’t know how to study film.
Sure, like any player, he had 
watched plenty of film, but what the 
sophomore was saying was that he 
didn’t know how to see it. He didn’t 
know how to watch all 10 players on 
the floor at the same time and have 
the wherewithal to ingest what was 
happening and why.
“Anybody 
can 
watch 
film,” 
Martelli said. “I think a player 
watches himself, but you have to 
watch, and I mean it’s not rocket 

science, but you have to be able to see 
the whole play even when you’re not 
involved with the ball.”
The film study with Martelli has 
continued into the unexpectedly 
abrupt postseason with the coach 
sending Nunez game clips and 
inspirational sayings.
Watching film, running drills over 
and over, for Nunez, it’s all part of the 
mental aspect of the game. He knows 
he can physically do what’s required 
of him because he’s done it before at 
some point or another.
He just needed to do it in front of 
thousands of people. 
Through nearly all of his in-game 
appearances, Nunez knew something 
was off. He was uptight, worried to 
death about whether he would make 
a mistake or squander his quickly 
vanishing playing time — it was a self-
fulfilling prophecy of failure.
“I didn’t have that mentality 
to just act free like the way I was 
playing before,” Nunez said. “I was 
so worried about either getting taken 
out or making a mistake, I was so 
focused on that that it kinda crippled 
me in that way.”
Since stepping into Howard’s 
office to tackle this mentality 
problem, Nunez has done nothing 
but try to loosen up and make the 
most of his time on the floor and, 
simply put, have fun. The Brooklyn 
native is even using all of his newly 
found free time in the coronavirus-
related quarantine to reflect and find 
a solution.
One outlet for Nunez to step out 
of his comfort zone comes from the 
popular app TikTok. The social media 
platform is used for a variety of goofy 
videos, and Nunez had adopted it to 
show himself dancing or expressing 
comic concepts. Currently, Nunez 
has 41,000 followers and nearly 
700,000 likes on his posts.
“People think I’m fooling around, 
but that’s taking me out of my comfort 
zone,” Nunez said. “It’s something 

that I never liked, to be showy. I 
never liked to have the attention. I’ve 
always been so reserved and tense 
trying to do everything right, but 
now I’m acting like a goofball in front 
of thousands of people, and just being 
loose, that’s a big thing.”
Largely due to his lack of success 
this past season, many people 
speculated Nunez’s name would be 
first up in the transfer portal.
With his first recruiting class, 
Howard made it clear the quality of 
talent coming to Ann Arbor would 
only rise, and Nunez struggled to fit 
into the rotation even with plenty 
of opportunities. But when the 
pandemic hit and the season ended, 
the decision to stay was a no-brainer 
for the sophomore.
“I definitely talked a little about it 
with my parents, but nothing really 
serious, like, ‘Oh I wanna stay here,’ 
I didn’t want to pack everything up,” 
Nunez said. “I know that if I can 
make it here, I can make it to the next 
level. Even if I kill at another school, 
it wouldn’t be the same, so I just 
decided to stay.”
Buried in his decision to stay is the 
idea that this will be the sophomore’s 
first season having the same coach 
and system from the year prior in 
nearly five years. Going from high 
school to prep school to Beilein to 
Howard has meant a lot of different 
systems and learning curves. A 
creature of routine, Nunez is more 
confident with a year of Howard’s 
plays under his belt.
Now that begs the question: What 
will Nunez’s role on the team be in 
the seasons to come?
Nunez wants to be known as an 
all-around player, not just a shooter. 
That means tackling his weaknesses, 
including on-ball defense, being able 
to come off screens and playing off a 
shot fake.
One aspect he personally wants to 
tackle is his ball-handling abilities. 
With point guards Zavier Simpson 
and David DeJulius leaving the 
program due to graduation and 
transfer, respectively, the vacuum 
at that position is one of the biggest 
question marks for the team. Nunez 
could be ins+++trumental in filling 
that void.
The bottom line for Nunez, 
though, is self-awareness. He knows 
what he needs to work on and is not 
shying away from the challenge. 
So perhaps the next time Nunez 
steps on the floor in a maize and 
blue jersey, he won’t be watching an 
opposing ball handler fly past him on 
his way to an easy bucket. Through 
relentless practice, film study and 
self-awareness, Nunez will flash a 
smile after showing the product of 
his trials and tribulations.

Guard Cole Bajema enters name in transfer portal

After one season, freshman 
guard Cole Bajema is potentially 
departing 
Ann 
Arbor 
as 
he 
submitted his name to the transfer 
portal, a program spokesperson 
confirmed to The Daily.
After not seeing the floor much 
during his first year in college 
basketball, Bajema has decided to 
test the transfer waters and land a 
spot at a program where he may be 
able to scrape together a larger role.
In his one year at Michigan, 
Bajema averaged just 2.6 ppg in 3.7 
minutes per game. Making the most 
of his time on the floor when he 
could, Bajema typically highlighted 
his ample on-court playing time 
with a late-game 3-point bomb. 
Going 4-for-7 from 3-point range 
over the season, Bajema showed 
promise as a deep threat.
As 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard’s first recruiting class is set 
to unpack their bags in Michigan’s 
dorm rooms, it is tough to imagine 

Bajema would have seen a dramatic 
uptick in his minutes during the 
upcoming season. Though there 
are question marks at the guard 
positions with a hodge podge 
of names swirling around as to 
who will replace Zavier Simpson 
and David DeJulius at the point, 
Bajema’s name still sat pretty low 
on those lists.
It is hard to speculate over a 
potential ceiling for the Lynden, 
Wash. native since he so rarely saw 
the floor. Only playing against low 
to mid-major foes in the beginning 
of the season or at the end of 
blowout games, Bajema was never 
really subject to the thralls of Big 
Ten regular season competition. 
If Bajema decides to leave 
the 
program, 
this 
will 
leave 
the Wolverines with two open 
scholarship spots for next season 
and a whopping six spots on their 
roster for the 2021 season. Just a 
few weeks ago, two more of those 
scholarships were made available 
due to Isaiah Todd’s decommitment 
in favor of the G League and five-

star recruit Joshua Christopher’s 
surprise decision to not commit to 
Michigan in favor of Arizona State.
While the Wolverines still boast 
the top recruiting class in the Big 
Ten despite the loss of the two 
highly-ranked prospects, depth will 
now be a big question for Michigan 
as it scrambles to fill roster spots 
with high-quality players. 
If Bajema does indeed depart, 
he will leave the other lone 
freshman in his recruiting class — 
Franz Wagner — to advance to his 
sophomore year as the only member 
left of his class. Wagner himself 
made headlines a few weeks ago by 
deciding to stay with the Wolverines 
instead of pursuing professional 
opportunities in the NBA.
In his one year, Bajema did show 
potential for growth but struggled 
to find a home in the rotation. 
Perhaps another program can offer 
that coveted spot where he can 
flourish into an offensive-minded 
weapon at the guard position.

Ruiz first of ten Wolverines selected in 2020 NFL Draft

Ten Michigan players were 
selected in the NFL Draft this 
weekend, the second-most of any 
school.
That stat is a bit misleading 
given that just two of those 
players — center Cesar Ruiz and 
linebacker Josh Uche — were 
selected in the first two days of the 
draft. Still, the Wolverines were 
one off their program record of 11 
players drafted, set in 2017. They 
also continued their streak of 82 
consecutive years with at least one 
player drafted, tied for the longest 
in the country with USC.
Michigan’s offensive line was the 
star of the show. All four players in 
the draft — Ruiz, tackle Jon Runyan 
and guards Michael Onwenu and 
Ben Bredeson — were drafted, a 
testament to Ed Warinner’s work 
with the unit after his hire in 2018. 
Ruiz, one of the Wolverines’ two 
early entrants, was drafted 24th 
overall by the New Orleans Saints. 
Bredeson went in the fourth round 
to the Baltimore Ravens while 
Onwenu and Runyan were selected 

in the sixth — the former by the 
New England Patriots and the 
latter by the Green Bay Packers.
The rest of the offense, however, 
had 
a 
disappointing 
showing. 
Donovan Peoples-Jones, once a 
five-star recruit, fell all the way 
to the sixth round before being 
selected by the Cleveland Browns. 
Quarterback Shea Patterson and 
tight end Sean McKeon went 
undrafted, though McKeon has 

since signed a free-agent deal with 
the Dallas Cowboys, according to 
247Sports.
Uche highlighted Michigan’s 
defensive picks after being selected 
in the second round by the Patriots. 
In Foxboro, Uche will join Onwenu 
and former Wolverine defensive 
end Chase Winovich.
None 
of 
Michigan’s 
other 
defensive players were projected 
surefire draftees, but four of the 

five saw themselves drafted. VIPER 
Khaleke Hudson was selected in 
the fifth round by Washington, 
while 
defensive 
end 
Michael 
Danna went later that round to the 
Kansas City Chiefs. Safety Josh 
Metellus and linebacker Jordan 
Glasgow were both sixth-round 
picks, with Metellus going to the 
Minnesota Vikings and Glasgow to 
the Indianapolis Colts.
Defensive 
back 
Lavert 
Hill 

somewhat 
surprisingly 
went 
undrafted, but signed a free-agent 
deal with the Chiefs shortly after 
the draft. Hill nearly went pro 
last season but decided to return 
to school; his fellow corner David 
Long was a third-round pick in 
2019.
Neither Glasgow nor Danna 
were invited to the NFL Draft 
Combine, and with Michigan’s pro 
day canceled due to COVID-19, 
both were somewhat surprising 
selections. 
Like 
his 
brothers, 
Glasgow completed his rise from 
walk-on to the NFL. Meanwhile, 
Danna, a graduate transfer from 
Central Michigan, made the most 
of his year in Ann Arbor. Just one 
other school had multiple draftees 
who were not invited to the 
combine.
Overall, the draft was a mixed 
bag for the Wolverines. Despite 
a large number of selections, 
most came in the late rounds and 
Peoples-Jones’ in particular was 
indicative of untapped potential. 
But Michigan also showed its 
ability to turn unheralded recruits 
— such as Glasgow, Metellus, 
Hudson and Danna — into draft 
picks.

Schoonbee’s Olympic dreams on hold

Jessica Schoonbee is bored.
She gets up around 7:30 every day 
— sleeping in compared to her typical 
rowing schedule at Michigan. 
She has an iced coffee and toast 
with peanut butter for breakfast.
She tries to squeeze in a workout 
either before or after her online 
classes, still only half the amount of 
training she does during the school 
year. 
In another reality, Jess would 
be finishing up her sophomomre 
year by taking finals in Ann Arbor 
and gearing up for another Big Ten 
Championship.
Or she’d be ramping up her 
practice schedule for the Final 
Olympic Qualification Regatta in 
Switzerland.
She’d be in a boat on Belleville 
Lake, training every day for the 
chance to bring home a national title 
at the end of the month.
Instead, she finishes her peanut 
butter toast and sits down at her 
computer. 
When she’s done with her school 
work, she tries to keep herself 
occupied, spending time with her 
family and running — she even dyed 
her own hair a couple weeks ago. 
That’s 
the 
routine 
she’s 
developed since returning home 
to Johannesburg in the middle of 
March, when her rowing career, her 
Olympic dreams and her life were 
put on hold because of COVID-19. 
Last May — just before Big Ten 
Championships — then-junior Tayla-
May Bentley picked up a call from 
Roger Barrows, the head coach of the 
South African National Team. He 
had a question: did she and Jess want 
to compete at the Under 23 World 

Championships? 
Both women had competed for 
the Junior National Team in high 
school, but because of their collegiate 
racing schedule, they didn’t think 
they’d get the opportunity to race for 
their home country again until after 
graduating. 
Jess and Tayla-May spent all 
year rowing in an eight and didn’t 
have any experience in a pair. The 
regatta was in less than two months 
— it would be a shot in the dark, 
but they’d dreamed of racing on 
the international stage again. They 
couldn’t pass up the opportunity.
They finished out the collegiate 
season — winning the Big Ten 
Championships 
and 
coming 
in 
third at NCAA Championships — 
and returned to Ann Arbor to start 
training in the pair. 
From then on, all they did was row. 
They woke up in the morning, went 
to practice at Belleville, came back to 
watch TV for a couple hours, then got 
up to go to afternoon practice. 
Transitioning from rowing in an 
eight to rowing in a pair isn’t easy. 
Maintaining balance in a smaller 
boat is more difficult, and racing in a 
pair typically takes longer. 
Still, that wasn’t their biggest 
obstacle. Because Jess and Tayla-
May were both used to rowing on 
the port side, Jess had to switch 
to starboard. In rowing, that’s 
practically the equivalent of waking 
up one day and deciding to be left-
handed. 
But they came back day after day. 
They had a single, unwavering focus: 
get on the podium at U23s. 
Day after day, they got faster. 
Before they knew it, they were 
sitting at the start of the A Final of 
the Under-23 World Championships 
next to Russia and Greece, the odds-
on favorites. 

“I was just adamant that someone 
was playing games with us,” Jess 
said. “That we weren’t actually that 
fast.” 
But it wasn’t a game. After months 
of training and planning, a lifetime 
of dreaming and hoping, for this 
moment, Jess and Tayla-May came 
in second on the international stage. 
The original plan had been to 
stop after U23s, but the second-place 
finish opened up new possibilities 
for the duo. They had speed. And 
the Senior World Championships, 
the 
first 
chance 
for 
Olympic 
qualification,were in a month. If 
they kept training, there was a good 
chance Jess and Tayla-May could 
qualify for the 2020 Games. 
But that meant more money, more 
practices and more international 
travel — not to mention the huge 
commitment of training for the 
Olympics if they qualified. The 
Olympics was their dream, though, 
and they never thought they’d have 
the opportunity at such a young age. 
Again, they took the leap of faith. 
They kept up their routine for 
another month before the regatta. 
But as the race got closer, Jess 
started to notice a stabbing pain in 
her side. She iced it and went to the 
team doctors, but nothing helped. 
She thought she had fractured her 
rib, but she couldn’t tell Tayla-May 
before the race. So Jess kept rowing 
despite the pain. 
In the end, whether it was the 
rib or their lack of experience in the 
pair, their hopes of qualifying at the 
Senior World Championships were 
short lived. Teams had to come in 
the top-three of the quarterfinal to 
stay in contention to qualify. Jess and 
Tayla-May were fifth, by a healthy 
margin. 
They had a choice to make. They 
could fly back to South Africa 
and 
keep 
training 
throughout 
the year for another chance to 
qualify in May at the Final Olympic 
Qualification Regatta, but that 
would mean they’d have to take 
the year off school. It would mean 
graduating a year late and missing a 
season the Wolverines were poised 
to dominate, with no guarantee 
their decision would pay off. Only 
two more pairs would qualify — it 
would be a long shot. 
Jess talked the decision over with 
her parents and coaches, but, in the 
end, it was her older brother Kyle — 
who’d already qualified to row at the 
2020 Games — who tipped the scales. 
“My brother said to me, ‘You 
haven’t been in the boat for that long. 
You switched sides; you fractured 

your rib; your rib’s gonna get fixed; 
you’re gonna get a lot faster. You’re 
going to qualify,’ ” Jess said. “So I 
decided I’m just going to give myself 
a shot.
“I was extremely nervous. It’s 
really hard to put all your eggs in one 
basket.” 
Jess and Tayla-May moved home 
to South Africa, rented an apartment 
and got back to work with the 
National Team. While Tayla-May 
trained out on the water in a single, 
Jess did what she could while she 
waited for her rib to heal. 
She spent some time with her 
family in Johannesburg. She watched 
“Jane the Virgin.” Sometimes, she’d 
get on the erg, an indoor rowing 
machine, to see if she could row. 
Yeah, still hurts. 
She tried to get her body moving 
any way she could — lifting and 
squats mostly — but even a heavy 
breath induced shooting pain. So 
mostly, she waited. 
Jess waited until a day in 
November when she was finally 
cleared to get back to training. Back 
to rowing. Back on the road to Tokyo. 
She left the doctor’s office and 
headed back to the apartment she 
shared with Tayla-May. Jess made 
herself dinner and settled onto the 
couch when Tayla-May came in 
with eyes bloodshot from crying. She 
was also on her way back from the 
doctor’s. 
The same day Jess was cleared, 
Tayla-May was told she’d injured 
both of her hip tendons. She likely 
needed surgery, keeping her out for 
the foreseeable future and making it 
unlikely she’d be back in time for the 
Olympics. 
The national coaches asked Jess if 
she would stay to train in a single and 
try to qualify by herself in the spring.
“It was really hard, because I did 
want to give myself a shot at the 
Olympics,” Jess said. “But a big part 
of it was that Tayla-May and I had 
started this journey together, and I 
didn’t want to end it without her.” 
After months of training and 
racing, 
thinking 
and 
decision-
making, injuries and recovery, it was 
time to go back to Michigan. 
Jess flew back to the US at the 
end of December for the Wolverines’ 
training 
trip 
in 
Florida. 
Even 
though she was disappointed how 
her Olympic quest had ended, she 
was ready to throw herself into 
Michigan’s season.
Last year, Jess stroked the 
Wolverines 
to 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Championship title and a third-place 
finish at the NCAA Championship. 
This year, their sights were set even 
higher. With four rowers and the 
coxswain returning from last year’s 

boat, Michigan believed it could go 
for gold — something the Wolverines 
haven’t done in over 20 years. 
“Everyone was so focused on 
getting better technically,” Jess said. 
“We knew that we could win this 
season, which was something that 
we didn’t know we could do last year. 
Previous to this year, we were almost 
too scared to want it really badly. You 
could also feel that we were almost 
scared of losing or failing. And I 
think this year it was like all that’s 
out the window — it doesn’t matter, 
we’re gonna win no matter what.”
But two weeks before their first 
scheduled race, all the rowers were 
called to the training center. Jess 
started to get a bad feeling. Classes 
had already been moved online 
due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and 
most other conferences had already 
canceled the rest of their seasons. 
Michigan coach Mark Rothstein 
was on a conference call when 
the team got to the practice room. 
They sat down, trying to prepare 
themselves for whatever was about 
to happen. Rothstein came in, still 
on the phone, and sat in a chair at 
the front of the room with his team 
staring back at him. He handed the 
phone to assistant coach Liz Tuppen 
and explained to a silent audience 
that their season was over before it 
had even begun. Complete silence 
fell over the room. 
There would be no Big Ten 
Championship and no NCAAs — no 
chance to build on last year’s success. 
For Jess, it was one more 
premature ending in what had been 
the most unpredictable year of her 
life. 
May isn’t going to be the month it 
could’ve been for Jess. She’ll never 
know whether she would have 
qualified with Tayla-May or how the 
Wolverines would have done in the 
postseason. 
For 
now, 
she’s 
at 
home, 
establishing a new normal after a 
year that has been anything but. 
About two weeks after she got 
home, it was announced the Tokyo 
Games were being pushed back to 
next summer. 
She still dreams of going to the 
Olympics, but there are so many 
factors to consider. She has no idea 
what the selection process would 
look like or how it would fit in with 
Michigan’s season. She doesn’t know 
when she’ll be allowed to train, or 
even what the next school year will 
look like.
After she heard the news, Jess 
checked her phone, and saw she’d 
gotten a message from Tayla-May. 
When she read it, she couldn’t tell if 
it was a joke: 
Should we go for it in 2021?
