Harbaugh flips six 
commits, including 
four-star QB Gentry, 
RB Karan Higdon

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

When 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
was 

introduced as Michigan’s football 
coach in the last week of Decem-
ber, it was viewed as a victory for 
the ages for the program, a piece 
of evidence that a duplication of 
the glory days of Bo Schembechler 
was around the next corner.

Wednesday’s National Signing 

Day was Harbaugh’s first chance 
to present tangible results. He 
was at a disadvantage from the 
start — he had only one month to 
fill out a recruiting class that had 
been decimated by the shaky job 
status and eventual firing of for-
mer coach Brady Hoke.

In his first news conference 

since his introduction, Harbaugh 

The birthplace of 
Ford’s Model T 

endures economic 

recession 

By ARIANA ASSAF

Daily Staff Reporter

As The Michigan Daily con-

tinues to watch and report on 
Detroit shaping its future, we 
want to reflect back on how the 
city got here. Our hope for this 

week’s Detroit History Series is 
that readers learn something new 
about the city and, in turn, better 
understand what’s to come.

The city of Detroit has been 

inextricably tied to the automo-
bile industry since Henry Ford 
established his Detroit-based 
company in 1903. The Great 
Depression marked the first 
of several drastic setbacks for 
Detroit’s auto industry, and the 
once-booming economic envi-
ronment is still recovering from 
the most recent economic reces-
sion.

The 
Detroit 
“Big 
Three” 

— General Motors, Ford and 
Chrysler — once dominated the 
industry, which together with 
the 
now-defunct 
American 

Motors, accounted for 95 of the 
market share at one time. The 
erosion of that power began in 
1982, when the Japanese compa-
ny Honda moved to Marysville, 
Ohio.

Arthur Schwartz, president 

of Labor and Economics Associ-
ates, an Ann Arbor-based con-
sulting firm, said the Big Three 
composed 45.5 percent of the 

market in 2014.

Michigan became the hub of 

the industry by 1905, just two 
years after Henry Ford brought 
his company to Detroit. The 
city already had several natural 
advantages — close proximity to 
sources of coal, iron and copper 
and a location easily accessible 
by water and land. Though auto-
mobiles were first developed in 
Germany and France, the Unit-
ed States was the first country 
to develop mass motorization, 
largely due to the improvement 

Lecture discusses 

recent White 

House efforts to 
reestablish ties

By KRISTEN ANDERSON

Daily Staff Reporter

With the White House begin-

ning to thaw relations with 
Cuba, three University profes-
sors gathered Wednesday to dis-
cuss the developing diplomatic 
relationship.

In an event titled “Re-estab-

lishing 
U.S.-Cuba 
Relations: 

Walking the Tightrope for Suc-
cess,” a panel of University 
scholars discussed a variety 
of issues revolving around the 
challenges and implications of 
the normalization of U.S.-Cuba 
relations.

Obama announced he would

Potential 2016 
presidential 

candidate hopes to 
lower opportunity gap

By JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, 

the son of 41st President George 
H. W. Bush and brother of 43rd 

President George W. Bush, dis-
cussed economic and immigra-
tion reform at the Cobo Center in 
Detroit Wednesday afternoon in 
what many pundits see as a trial 
speech before a potential presi-
dential campaign.

The Detroit Economic Club 

hosted the ticketed event with 
about 600 club members, guests 
and a mix of university and high 
school students in attendance.

Bush, 
who 
in 
December 

announced he is considering a 

presidential run in 2016, advocat-
ed primarily for a new economic 
plan rooted in conservative prin-
ciples.

Though he did not provide 

many details for specific policies, 
he said his agenda would focus on 
an immigration policy that would 
drive the economy. He also advo-
cated for “economic freedom,” 
and through that, a reduction 
in the “opportunity gap,” a term 
which refers to the ways in which 
race, socio-economic status and 

other factors influence one’s abil-
ity to attain educational or eco-
nomic achievement, among other 
markers.

Bush’s remarks aligned closely 

with the plan of his Right to Rise 
political action committee, which 
was launched earlier this year 
and is dedicated toward reform-
ing immigration policies and 
addressing the national income 
gap.

“We believe that every Ameri-

Clerks performed 
unions in March 
after judge ruled 

ban unconstitutional 

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

Republican Gov. Rick Snyder 

announced Wednesday after-
noon that the state would not 
appeal a district court’s Janu-
ary decision ordering it recog-
nize the nearly 300 same-sex 
marriages performed in Michi-
gan last March.

The original district court 

ruling in Caspar v. Snyder was 
stayed for 21 days to allow 
time for the state to file an 
appeal, meaning the ruling 
would not go into effect for 21 
days. Because the state has not 
chosen to file an appeal, the 
marriages will now be consid-
ered valid to receive state ben-
efits after the stay terminates 
Thursday,

“The judge has determined 

that same-sex couples were 

legally married on that day, 
and we will follow the law and 
extend state marriage benefits 
to those couples,” Snyder said 
in a statement Monday.

The governor had previously 

stated that though he believed 
the marriages were valid, he 
did not think they were eligible 
for state benefits. Following the 
January ruling in Caspar v. Sny-
der, his office did not respond 
to requests for comment.

In an interview Wednesday 

afternoon, Law Prof. Julian 
Mortenson, who worked as a 
cooperating attorney on the 
case on behalf of the plain-
tiffs, said the legal analysis of 
the decision is still develop-
ing. However, he said once the 
stay terminates the marriages 
should have the same legal 
meaning as a marriage between 
a man and woman in the state.

“The legal upshot, in all hon-

esty, is extremely simple,” he 
said. ““There is no distinction 
between those Michigan mar-
riages that are between same-
sex couples and those in-state 
marriages that are between

Former councilwoman Sally Hart 
Petersen to run for Ward 2 seat
‘U’ class on AIDs adapted 
for online course platform

Prof. hopes to 

maintain campus 
connection in new 

settting 

BY ISOBEL FUTTER

For the Daily

With an online platform 

called Coursera, the University 
is offering a popular class 
on AIDS to more than 1,000 
students around the world.

Through 
Coursera, 

universities across the globe 
develop massive open online 
courses, 
or 
MOOCs, 
and 

publish them for anyone to 
take. 
The 
University 
has 

created 24 MOOCs over the 
last three years, 18 of which are 
currently running, including 
the brand new course AIDS: 
Fear and Hope.

The 
course 
is 
an 

interdisciplinary class on the 
history, politics and social 
implications 
of 
the 
AIDS 

epidemic. More than 1,100 
people from all over the world 
are currently enrolled in the 
course, and enrollment remains 
open for two more weeks.

For 
the 
class, 
students 

watch lectures posted in each 
of the seven units, and then 
take quizzes at the end of each 
unit. If participants complete 
the course, they receive a 
certificate 
of 
completion. 

Though 
the 
units 
have 

deadlines, students can work 
at their own pace within the 
course.

The AIDS online course 

is based on a class offered 
at 
the 
University, 
taught 

by American Culture Prof. 
Richard 
Meisler. 
The 

University’s Office of Digital 
Education 
and 
Innovation, 

which 
is 
responsible 
for 

creating MOOCs, works closely 
with professors like Meisler 
to 
expand 
and 
transform 

University courses into online 
classes.

“I’ve 
been 
teaching 
the 

course on campus for years. 
What I did was translate it 
into this new format,” Meisler 
said. “It’s an interesting new 
development. It’s just started, 
and from the very beginning, 
we’ve had students from China, 
Ukraine, Sweden, and so it’s 
an interesting experiment in 
making education available to a 
wide range of people.”

James 
Devaney, 
assistant 

vice provost of the DEI, said 
selecting courses for MOOCs is 
a challenging process.

“One of the reasons we 

chose this course is that it has 
enriched the lives of students 
on campus for decades,” he 
said. “So, we picked it because 
we can deliver it to a massive 
audience 
to 
enliven 
the 

discussion around AIDS, and 
further student understanding 
on the subject, which is really 
exciting.”

The topic of AIDS resonates 

deeply with Meisler. He said 
he enjoys the multidisciplinary 
aspect, and he stressed that the 
crisis of AIDS can be viewed 
through many different lenses.

“When AIDS first came 

out, it was very frightening, 
everybody was scared,” Meisler 

said. “I just wanted to know 
more about it. I’ve always been 
interested in things that are 
interdisciplinary with science, 
social science and humanities.”

All of the course units 

include 
lectures 
conducted 

by Meisler, as well as papers 
and articles on the epidemic. 
Meisler 
also 
offers 
videos, 

many of which include his 
interviews with people who 
recount the original outbreak 
in detail. Other videos show 
politicians 
discussing 
their 

approach to solving the AIDS 
epidemic.

“There’s videos on testing, 

politics and then some of the 
most interesting sessions are 
sessions in which people that 
I 
interview 
remember 
the 

beginning of the epidemic in 
Detroit, in Washington, in San 
Juan, Puerto Rico and other 
places.”

Though this is the first time 

that the course has been offered 
on Coursera, both Meisler and 
the DEI have high expectations 
for the course. Devaney said 
the class is a helpful tool for 
students at the University, 
and encourages that they sign 
up before the deadline in two 
weeks.

“It has the potential to enrich 

and enliven the discourse that’s 
part of the class,” Devaney 
said. “When you have multiple 
thousands 
of 
participants 

engaging in that course in the 
MOOC, one will get access to 
new and more diverse points of 
view and multiple disciplines. 
If we can learn from those 
perspectives, there will be 
interesting implications.”

Current rep. Jane 
Lumm unsure if she 

will pursue third 

term in office

BY LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

After vacating her seat on 

Ann Arbor City Council dur-
ing an unsuccessful attempt 
at the 2014 mayoral race, Sally 
Hart Petersen said she hopes to 
regain a spot.

Peterson 
pulled 
petitions 

from the city clerk’s office to 
run as a Democrat in city’s 
Ward 2 earlier this week. She 
will have to gather signatures 
from 100 voters to secure her 
name on the August primary 
ballot.

Petersen is running for the 

seat of Councilmember Jane 
Lumm (I–Ward 2). In an inter-
view with The Ann Arbor News 

earlier this week, Lumm said 
she said she would “most like-
ly” seek re-election this year.

Petersen 
served 
on 
City 

Council for two years as a 
Democrat for the Second Ward 
before losing to Christopher 
Taylor in the mayoral race last 
year. She plans to run for City 
Council to continue working on 
projects started during her pre-
vious terms.

“I still have so much unfin-

ished business I want to con-
tinue to work on,” she said in 
an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily.

One 
of 
those 
projects 

involves economic develop-
ment for Ann Arbor.

“I feel very strongly that the 

city needs to pursue a sustain-
able fiscal policy so that we 
can stir more revenue in order 
to pay for all of the wonderful 
things that we want to do in our 
community,” Petersen said.

Petersen said Ann Arbor’s 

main revenue comes from 

property taxes, so Ann Arbor 
needs to focus on maintaining 
and introducing more com-
panies and jobs to the city to 
promote economic activity and 
increase property tax values.

Peterson added that, as a 

result of major budget cuts in 
2009 and 2010, Ann Arbor’s 
basic city services have suf-
fered.

“Now the economy is bet-

ter, but we need to increase 
our bottom line so that we can 
restore services to where they 
were,” Petersen said.

Petersen 
also 
plans 
to 

improve relations between the 
city of Ann Arbor and the Uni-
versity.

“There 
is 
this 
pent-up 

resentment among the city 
and among the city’s residents 
that the University of Michi-
gan doesn’t pay taxes, and we 
have to provide all these ser-
vices to U of M employees and 
students, for which they’re 
not compensating the city,” 
Petersen said.

However, 
she 
said 
City 

Council must put aside this 
resentment and find ways to 
collaborate with the Universi-
ty to promote job and company 
growth in Ann Arbor.

Petersen, who is currently 

chairwoman of Ann Arbor’s 
Commission 
on 
Disability 

Issues, said she also intends to 
raise awareness on City Coun-
cil about issues faced by people 
with disabilities.

Specifically, Petersen noted 

that the current crosswalk 
ordinance in Ann Arbor cre-
ates ambiguity and poses a 
danger to residents with dis-
abilities. The local ordinance 
states that drivers must stop 
for pedestrians waiting on the 
curb. However, because Uni-
versity police officers follow 
state law, they can’t enforce the 
ordinance.

“There’s 
some 
ambiguity 

that, through better commu-
nication, the city and the Uni-
versity can help to resolve,” she 
said.

of the assembly line in 1913 used to 
create the Ford Model T.

Fast forward to the 21st century. 

Even before Detroit filed for bank-
ruptcy, the industry’s production 
was not what it used to be. Car com-
panies struggled as the economy’s 
health declined. In response, the 
U.S. government created a short 
incentive program, called Cash 
for Clunkers, designed to renew 
demand for vehicles at a time when 
the market struggled for cash. 
Between July and August 2009, 
buyers who turned in old, fuel-inef-
ficient vehicles received a financial 
break on a new car.

Yen Chen, a senior research 

economist at the Center for Auto-
motive Research in Ann Arbor, co-
published a research memorandum 
in 2010 documenting the program’s 
success. He found that 44 percent of 
light vehicles sold in these months 
were due to the program.

“For the first time in a long time, 

the industry experienced the first 
signs of recovery,” Chen said.

As production rebounded, work-

ers returned to production lines. 
Chrysler and General Motors com-
pleted restructuring and a planned 
bankruptcy that shut down produc-
tion during most of the summer 
of 2009. Combined with external 
monetary support and a healing 
economy, the industry began to take 
a turn for the better.

As the economy stabilized and 

Americans 
found 
employment, 

Chen said those workers also pur-
chased cars to ensure their ability to 
get to work.

“When people find jobs, they 

need a vehicle to commute,” he said. 
“The major reason behind vehicle 
sale, from my point of view, is full-
time employment. People find full 
time employment, they need to be 
able to commute daily.”

Schwartz, who was general 

director of labor relations at Gen-
eral Motors during the mid-1980s, 
was responsible for planning union 
negotiations.

Schwartz remained on the team 

through the restructuring of 2009. 
He recalled the negotiations that 
attempted to halt decline.

“In ’07 the company was sink-

ing, so something had to be done,” 
he said.

He cited labor laws as one factor, 

along with disputes over General 
Motors’ wages compared to those of 
Toyota. Another important issue, he 
said, resulted from General Motors’ 
retirees relying on pensions. Their 
number of retirees was larger than 
a company like Toyota, which was 
much newer to the United States.

“We were carrying hundreds of 

thousands of retirees, but of course, 

since Toyota didn’t come in until 
1988, they weren’t carrying hardly 
anything at all,” he said.

That year, General Motors nego-

tiated to turn the liability of about 
400,000 of its retirees to the Volun-
tary Employee Beneficiary Associa-
tion, a type of trust fund permitted 
under federal tax law. Though this 
wouldn’t take effect until 2010, the 
move freed General Motors from 
a significant amount of financial 
responsibility.

“Billions came off the books,” 

Schwartz said.

Another major, still controversial 

aspect of that year’s negotiations 
was the creation of a two-tier wage. 
Because wages were relatively high 
for workers not staffing the line, 
especially compared to Toyota, the 
company decided that incoming 
workers would receive a starting 
salary of $16 per hour instead of 
$28.50.

Schwartz said the goal was to pay 

less for easier jobs. However, work-
ers who had been with the company 
for many years had earned senior-
ity, and thus tended to opt for easier 
work. To avoid paying senior work-
ers less, negotiators decided that the 
lower, second-tier wages would be 
automatically given to new workers.

“VEBA and second-tier wages 

went a long way in reducing the gap 
between the Big Three and Toyota, 
Honda, Nissan as far as labor rates 
are concerned,” Schwartz said. 
“Plus, we could bring more work 
into the plant.”

However, the climate took a bad 

turn when the 2008 financial crisis 
occurred. Sales dropped by about 
40 percent, a significant decrease 
for automobile manufacturers. Ford 
was able to borrow money from 
private financial institutions, but 
Chrysler and General Motors had 
to turn to the government after the 
banking crisis hit the private sector. 
This led to the 2009 negotiations 
that involved the undoing of the 
second-tier wage ceiling and the 
discontinuation of a long-standing 
jobs bank, a program that allowed 
laid off workers to continue receiv-
ing some benefits.

“The whole contract was very 

painful for everybody, especially 
the union,” Schwartz said. “I give 
them a lot of credit on the ‘09 nego-
tiation.”

Schwartz expressed the widely 

held belief that the government 
came out ahead by avoiding the 
cost of social welfare that would 
have resulted if General Motors 
had gone bankrupt.

In terms of Detroit as an indus-

try city, Schwartz thinks it’s mak-
ing a comeback.

“We really haven’t picked up 

any market share, but we haven’t 
lost like we were losing before and 
sales are good,” Schwartz said. 
“We’re making money.”

can in every community has a 
right to pursue happiness,” Bush 
said Wednesday. “They have a 
right to rise.”

Bush told the crowd that since 

the 2008 economic recession, 
the country has seen some eco-
nomic relief, but still has a long 
way to go.

“The recovery has been every-

where but in the family pay-
checks,” he said. “The American 
Dream has become a mirage for 
far too many.”

Speaking specifically to the 

younger demographic, Bush said 
Americans need to embrace the 
period they live in and view their 
difficulties as economic oppor-
tunities.

“We need young, dynamic 

people that can make immediate 
contribution to our economy,” 
Bush said. “We shouldn’t be fear-
ful of this. We should say, ‘What 
an incredible opportunity.’”

He said to the solution to 

increasing opportunity is grow-
ing the economy, citing problems 
with the American education 
system as connected the state of 

the country’s economy.

“It’s an economic issue, but it’s 

also a huge moral issue,” Bush 
said on education. “Our country 
doesn’t do this well. These huge 
(income) gaps that exist are now 
increasing because of education 
dropouts. This is not the envi-
ronment that has led the world.”

Bush said he aims for the U.S. 

economy not to accept anything 
less than an annual 4-percent 
growth rate, which he added 
could contribute to narrowing 
the opportunity gap.

“Trust me, if we grew at 4 per-

cent, our growth, income rising 
from the middle, people have 
a chance to leave poverty, we 
would help other countries that 
will prepare to follow suit,” he 
said.

Bush also said immigration 

reform should be viewed as an 
economic issue, not a political 
issue.

Immigration has been moved 

to the forefront of the nation-
al political agenda, recently 
following 
President 
Barack 

Obama’s controversial plan to 
expand eligibility for immigra-
tion deferral. Republicans have 
unsuccessfully voted twice to 
defund the plan in recent weeks.

Bush added that Americans 

and immigrants should cherish 
their heritage and identity.

“In that, we would reestablish 

this unique American experi-
ence, which is you come, you 
work hard, you embrace these 
values and you’re as American as 
anybody that came on the May-
flower,” he said.

Addressing 
his 
as-of-yet 

uncertain 2016 campaign, Bush 
said if he decides to run, he 
does not want to participate in 
the negative rhetoric associated 
with campaigns.

“If I go beyond the consid-

eration, I hope I have the dis-
cipline to not turn back and get 
into the food fights,” Bush said.

State and national Democrats 

responded strongly to Bush’s 
speech Wednesday citing what 
has become a familiar criticism 
for Republicans in Detroit — 
criticism of their stances on the 
2008 auto bailout. That point 
was also raised during the 2012 
election for then-presidential 
candidate Mitt Romney, who 
penned an editorial in 2008 
titled “Let Detroit Go Bank-
rupt.”.

Obama delivered a speech in 

Metro Detroit last month tout-

ing his administration’s efforts 
to strengthen the auto industry.

“Jeb Bush has an interesting 

sense of humor going to Detroit 
to talk about urban revitaliza-
tion, after opposing the auto 
rescue that is helping Detroit 
and Michigan rebound from the 
recession,” said U.S. House Rep. 
Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D–
Fla.), chair of the Democratic 
National Committee, in a state-
ment. “But it shouldn’t come 
as a surprise. This is the same 
guy who supports massive tax 
breaks benefitting the wealthi-
est Americans and biggest cor-
porations at the expense of 
working Americans. And it’s the 
same guy who has spent much of 
the past decade enriching him-
self at big banks and concocting 
problematic business deals.”

Bush is not the first potential 

presidential candidate to stop in 
Metro Detroit in recent months. 
In November, former Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton cam-
paigned for Democratic candi-
dates in Rochester Hills, Mich. 
In August, Sen. Elizabeth War-
ren (D-Mass.) campaigned for 
then Rep. Gary Peters during his 
successful campaign for the U.S. 
Senate.

relations with Cuba, including 
a push to end a trade embargo 
between the two countries. The 
announcement signaled an end-
ing to a decades-long period of 
no formal relationship between 
the two countries.

The program, held at the Ford 

School, was co-sponsored by 
the Center for Latin American 
and Caribbean Studies, Michi-
gan News, the Ford School of 
Public Policy’s International 
Policy Center and the Cuban 
Research Institute at Florida 
International University.

The 
panelists 
included 

Anthropology Prof. Ruth Behar; 
Silvia Pedraza, sociology and 
American 
culture 
professor, 

Pedraza and Public Policy Prof. 

Melvyn Levitsky, the former 
U.S. ambassador to Brazil.

Pedraza 
highlighted 
the 

ambitions 
both 
countries 

brought to the negotiation pro-
cess, which included immigra-
tion and travel policies; U.S. 
possession of Guantanamo Bay; 
the trade embargo levied by the 
U.S against Cuba and access 
to 
telecommunications 
for 

Cubans.

She said she believed the 

United States and Cuba would 
come to agreement on a number 
of those concerns, but that some 
issues would remain points of 
contention.

Levitsky said because more 

than 160 countries currently 
have relations with Cuba, in 
general, having a diplomatic 
relationship with the country 
is no longer viewed as excep-
tional.

He added that he thinks for-

mal relations with the country 
have an impact on relationships 
beyond the government itself.

“It’s important to have diplo-

matic relations so that you can 
have a dialogue with the gov-
ernment even if it’s an unfriend-
ly relationship,” Levitsky said. 
“An establishment of relations 
does not suddenly mean we’re 
going to become friends with 
the Cuban government. But it 
may, in fact, allow us to become 
more friendly and closer up 
with the Cuban population.”

LSA senior Marianna Yama-

moto, who attended the panel, 
said she thought the three dif-
ferent perspectives on the panel 
provided a well-rounded bal-
ance of expertise across subject 
areas.

“This is something that’s 

happening now,” she said. “It’s 

really going to affect our future 
and we have a lot to look for-
ward to, I guess, and see how 
this plays out, and I think we 
can all learn a lot from the situ-
ation.”

Lenny 
Valerio, 
program 

manager at the Center for Latin 
American and Caribbean Stud-
ies, said she anticipated more 
events on U.S.-Cuban relations 
in the future.

“We hope to keep organizing 

events not only on U.S.-Cuba 
relations, but also on Cuba’s 
own historical, cultural and 
political relations to other Latin 
American countries,” she wrote 
in an e-mail interview. “I think 
that the re-establishment of 
diplomatic relations with the 
U.S. is an excellent moment to 
reassess Cuba’s influence in 
Latin America and the Carib-
bean.”

CUBA

said that he didn’t view the 
potential recruiting obstacles in 
his way as impediments.

“It wasn’t difficult — it was a 

real joy, a real pleasure,” Har-
baugh said. “Just the things 
that I learned about some of the 
players that were already com-
mitted under Coach Hoke and 
his regime, and they did a tre-
mendous job.”

Harbaugh’s first recruiting 

class at Michigan will consist 
of 14 players, just six of which 
were 
committed 
to 
Michi-

gan before Harbaugh’s hiring. 
Though Harbaugh said that 
the recruiting process hasn’t 
changed a great deal since he 
last recruited at Stanford five 
years ago, he noted that begin-
ning his new role required some 
level of adjustment.

“Did I just go right into it and 

pick up where I left off back 
when I coached at Stanford? 
No, I picked up two days after 
an NFL season,” Harbaugh said. 
“Had to familiarize yourself 
with who the players are, high 

school coaches again, hadn’t 
spent a whole fall evaluating 
tape coaching the San Francisco 
49ers.”

Toughness 
and 
competi-

tiveness were two of the key 
attributes that Harbaugh was 
searching for in this recruiting 
class. Given the late start for his 
staff, a class filled with four- 
and five-star players seemed 
unlikely. Still, Michigan man-
aged to pull off some surprises, 
compiling a class that had four 
players ranked among ESPN’s 
top 300 recruits.

One of those players is four-

star quarterback Zach Gen-
try, 
who 
Harbaugh 
flipped 

from Texas on Jan. 24. Gentry 
and another four-star recruit 
according to ESPN, early enroll-
ee Alex Malzone, will bolster 
the depth of Michigan’s quar-
terback corps, a position group 
that returns minimal experi-
ence.

But it wasn’t positional needs 

that seemed to excite Harbaugh 
most for this class. Known for 
his competitive nature, there 
seemed to be an extra sense of 
pride in Harbaugh’s voice when 
he talked about the competitive-

ness of the players, particularly 
Keith Washington, a relatively 
unheralded cornerback recruit 
from Alabama, who committed 
to and signed with the Wolver-
ines on Wednesday.

When Harbaugh and defen-

sive coordinator D.J. Durkin 
went to Alabama to visit, they 
sat 
with 
Washington 
and 

his father, discussing Wash-
ington’s 
speed. 
Washington 

claimed to run a 4.3 40-yard 
dash time, which would be on 
par with some of the faster 
players in the NFL. Initially, 
Harbaugh doubted his claim.

“He goes, ‘I’ll go out in the 

parking lot and run it for you 
right now,’ ” Harbaugh said 
with a laugh. “And he was seri-
ous, dead serious. I liked him 
even more. I knew he was a 
competitor.”

The Michigan ties of his 

recruits were another point 
of pride for Harbaugh. One 
was three-star recruit Jon 
Runyan Jr., the son of former 
Michigan star Jon Runyan. 
Harbaugh said he was told 
Runyan Jr. wore a Michigan 
onesie when he was a year old. 
Kicker Andrew David grew up 

a Michigan fan. Harbaugh said 
four-star safety Tyree Kinnel 
was handed a Michigan foot-
ball at birth. Grant Perry — a 
three-star wide receiver who 
attended Birmingham (Michi-
gan) Brother Rice along with 
Malzone — grew up getting 
autographs 
from 
Wolverine 

football players.

After Harbaugh’s presser, 

Michigan added another player 
with close ties to the program 
in three-star tight end recruit 
T.J. Wheatley Jr., the son of 
Michigan running backs coach 
Ty Wheatley, a former Wolver-
ine standout himself.

Harbaugh said he hasn’t 

watched a great deal of tape yet 
on his current team, instead 
preferring to give all of his 
players the opportunity to 
make a first impression. The 
same logic will apply when 
assessing early playing time for 
the members of this recruiting 
class.

“They have the license and 

the ability to do that,” Har-
baugh said. “All things will be 
earned on the field. There’s no 
guarantees, 
only 
opportuni-

ties.”

opposite-sex couples. They are 
all marriages, full stop, for the 
purpose of every distinction as 
to which that question is rel-
evant under Michigan law.”

The 300 marriages were per-

formed during a brief window 
between a separate district 
court decision — which ruled 
the state’s same-sex marriage 
ban unconstitutional — and a 
stay on that decision. The mar-
riages faced legal uncertainty 
while a larger legal battle over 
the legality of same-sex mar-
riage nationwide ensued.

Michigan’s ban on same-sex 

marriage is currently before 

the U.S Supreme Court, with 
oral arguments expected to 
occur in April, after the Sixth 
Circuit ruled late last year that 
the ban was constitutional, 
overturning the district court’s 
decision.

Snyder said he looked for-

ward to that ruling to deter-
mine the overall legality of 
same-sex marriage.

“This is an issue that has 

been divisive across our coun-
try,” he said, “Our nation’s 
highest court will decide this 
issue. I know there are strong 
feelings on both sides of this 
issue, and it’s vitally important 
for an expedient resolution that 
will allow people in Michigan, 
as well as other states, to move 
forward together on the other 

challenges we face.”

Proponents of same-sex mar-

riage in the state and beyond 
applauded the decision to let 
the marriages stand Monday 
afternoon.

Ingham County Clerk Barb 

Byrum, who was one of several 
county clerks to issue licenses 
to same-sex couples in March, 
said in a statement that the 
decision was the right choice 
for the state.

Because the district court 

decision occurred over the 
weekend, not all clerks opened 
their offices.

“Love has won today for the 

300 same-sex marriages that 
took place last spring, affording 
these couples the rights they 
deserve, like all other families 

under the law,” Byrum said. 
“This is a critical step forward 
in our fight to secure the free-
dom to marry for all Michigan-
ders.”

Brad O’Connor, president of 

the Jim Toy Community Cen-
ter, which serves as a resource 
for the LGBTQ community in 
Washtenaw County, commend-
ed Snyder on saving taxpayer 
money through not pursuing 
the case further, though he 
noted the state was still pursu-
ing an appeal of the case on the 
same-sex marriage ban.

“I’m relieved that the gover-

nor decided to not appeal this,” 
he said. “I commend him for 
taking the taxpayers into con-
sideration — it’s a good step.”

There is no arguing the fact that society and 

moral thinking have undergone a transforma-
tion in recent years. The very concept of sub-
stantial human rights, those that rest upon a 
foundation of universality, was one that did 
not gain momentum until the latter half of the 
20th century. With the evolution of modern 
thinking, debate has been reinvigorated on 
many key issues, one of which has become piv-
otal: torture. But how is torture defined? 

Offering a definition is, in great part, a 

subjective matter and varies depending on 
changing cultural landscapes. What’s seen 
as gruesome and unjust in one region of the 
world may be seen as commonplace in anoth-
er. While discussion on the topic tends away 
from universality, there are some key aspects 
that can be agreed upon: the use of torture 
is done with intent to cause severe bodily or 
psychological harm, is typically carried out by 
authority figures and is undoubtedly a process 
that circumvents all bounds of human moral-
ity. Keeping such principles in mind, how 
can we expect the benefits of human rights 
advancements to take firm hold if such terrible 
acts endure? 

Many may point to the perceived benefits 

of such acts, saying that they are effective in 
extracting vital pieces of information in rela-
tion to issues such as criminal activity, or even 
terrorist plots in some instances. The latter 
notion gained great popularity after the events 
of September 11, in which alarm and emotional 
turmoil were at an all-time high. However, it’s 
important to note that everybody has a differ-
ent threshold for pain — a key component of 
torture practices — and once this threshold is 
crossed, a person is liable to say almost any-
thing to bring an end to their suffering. 

Not only is the quality of the informa-

tion inconsistent and marred, but someone 
who is innocent may confess to doing some-
thing with which they had no association. 
This is problematic on all fronts, and offers 
no true progress when it comes to obtain-
ing true intelligence. Mark Mazzetti of The 
New York Times stated in his piece, “C.I.A. 
Report Found Value of Brutal Interrogation 
Was Inflated,” that the agency conducted an 
internal review, coined the Panetta Review. 

The ensuing report was compiled in order to 
look into the day-to-day interactions between 
prison guards and detainees. 

Accordingly, it was revealed that the 

value of information obtained during “brutal 
interrogations” 
of 
these 
detainees 
was 

repeatedly overstated. How can torture 
continue to be a popular form of gaining 
information when the results often carry 
such little validity and accuracy? If the largest 
argument for torture is flawed at its core, there 
exists a major problem with how intelligence 
agencies and people of authority handle 
inmate interrogation. Henceforth, there’s no 
true practical justification for performing such 
actions, as the human rights violations amount 
to minimal gain — should these violations even 
be occurring in the first place. 

International human rights standards take 

clear stances against the use of torture. As 
stated in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, “No one shall be subjected 
to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.” 

The term “torture” is used specifically 

in the text of the article. From this evidence 
alone, the use of such coercive action stands 
in direct violation of fundamental modern 
human rights goals. Even one such violation 
of a human being’s rights is grave enough to 
deserve reprimand. As Yousef Munayyer pro-
claimed, “Acknowledgment of torture is not 
accountability for it.” 

It’s not enough to simply recognize these 

inhuman practices are occurring; there 
must be an active effort led internationally 
to 
eradicate 
such 
practices 
from 
the 

governmental and penal systems. The public 
needs to be more critical of government and 
its practices, and we as a people must be 
guided by our morality in the elimination 
of such cruel punishment. Once everyone is 
educated about the true nature and violations 
torture carries with it —and this is true 
at every level of society — then the world 
will advance down a path of upheld rights, 
leaving such heinous aspects of past society 
suspended in memory.

No place for torture

Paying attention to the overcorrections

TYLER CHARBONEAU | VIEWPOINT

S

hortly after the credibility of 
Rolling Stone’s article “A Rape 
on Campus” began unravel-

ing, Slate Maga-
zine published a 
similar long-form 
investigative 
piece. Emily Yof-
fe’s “The College 
Rape Overcorrec-
tion,” 
however, 

went 
generally 

unnoticed, 
par-

ticularly on this 
campus. 
Yoffe’s 

piece also con-
cerned rape accu-
sations dating back to 2012, but her 
piece focused on a male undergrad-
uate student named Drew Sterrett at 
the University of Michigan.

Though the incident in question 

happened in March of 2012, the vic-
tim’s accusation was not made until 
the following summer. Sterrett was 
home for the summer when he was 
contacted by a University official 
and told to make himself available 
for a Skype interview with adminis-
trators, though no reason was given 
to him. When he became concerned 
by the tenor of the interview and 
asked to consult a lawyer, Sterrett 
was told that if he ended the inter-
view in order to seek counsel, that 
fact would be reported to the Uni-
versity and the investigation would 
continue without his input.

In response to the accusations 

against him, Sterrett and his counsel 
compiled affidavits from classmates 
who attested that their words had 
been misconstrued and even falsi-
fied. Sterrett’s roommate, who had 
been in the room the night in ques-
tion, included a statement claim-
ing that the accuser was a willing 
participant and that he would have 
heard and intervened if he had 
heard the woman saying no.

Sterrett’s rebuttal also noted that 

the accuser’s documents failed to 
mention the role her mother played 
in bringing accusations against him 
after she found and read her daugh-
ter’s diary. The accuser’s roommate 
swore in an affidavit on Sterrett’s 
behalf, in which she said the accus-
er’s mother had called her repeat-
edly over the summer, warning her 
not to talk to Sterrett and to take 
her daughter’s side in all proceed-
ings. The accuser’s roommate stat-
ed that she never saw any change 
in the accuser’s behavior from the 
time of the alleged assault until the 
end of freshman year, but rather, 
her personality changed dramati-
cally after her mother found her 
diary and the fall semester began.

Given the compelling support 

Sterrett had responsibly compiled, 
it would seem unfounded for the 
University to take drastic measures. 
Nonetheless, despite his evidence, 
Sterrett was suspended from the 
University until July 2016 — after 
the accuser graduated — and in 
order for the University to consider 
reinstating him, he would have to 
agree that he engaged in sexual mis-
conduct. Regardless of whether or 
not he returned, the finding would 
stay on his permanent record. Ster-
rett has since filed a lawsuit again 
the University alleging that he had 
been deprived of his constitutional 
right to due process.

Sexual assault at colleges and 

universities is a serious problem, 
and the attention it is currently 
receiving is the direct result of the 
longstanding history of the callous 
and dismissive 
treatment 
of 

victims. 
Too 

often, victims 
who 
come 

forward 
are 

doubted 
or 

dismissed, and 
those respon-
sible are not 
held account-
able. 
While 

it 
is 
agreed 

upon that those who commit serious 
sexual crimes must be held respon-
sible, the methods through which to 
implement the necessary standards 
remain debated.

The Department of Education 

has begun developing new rules to 
address women’s safety on college 
campuses, some of which have been 
turned into law by Congress, with 
more legislation underway. Howev-
er, in the necessary effort to protect 
victims of sexual assault, the proce-
dures that are being put into place on 
college campuses across the United 
States automatically presume the 
guilt of the accused. With encour-
agement from federal officials, col-
leges have been quick to institute 
solutions to sexual violence against 
women that, in turn, abrogate the 
civil rights of men — the University 
of Michigan included.

As The New York Times’ Jed 

Rubenfeld wrote, in reference to a 
group of schools that includes the 
University of Michigan, “mistaken 
findings of guilt are a real possibil-
ity because the federal government 
is forcing schools to use a lowered 
evidentiary standard — the ‘more 
likely than not’ standard, which 
is much less exacting than crimi-
nal law’s ‘proof beyond a reason-

able doubt’ requirement — at their 
rape trials.” Because of this drastic 
reduction in burden of proof, 28 
Harvard Law School professors 
have come forward condemning the 
university’s new sexual assault pro-
cedure, claiming they lack the “most 
basic elements of fairness and due 
process” and for being “overwhelm-
ingly stacked against the accused.”

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

should be urged to keep this in mind 
as it continues to review and reas-
sess the University’s own policies. 
Sexual assault on campus should be 
handled no differently than sexual 
assault in a court of law. As proposed 
by Rubenfeld in his opinion piece, 
the college hearing process should 
be integrated with law enforcement. 
While many college students choose 
to report incidents of sexual assault 
to their school, and not the police, 

universities alone 
should not deter-
mine the punish-
ment, 
and 
vice 

versa — in part 
because most vic-
tims are reluctant 
to report assault to 
the police.

Rubenfeld 

argued the impor-
tance of new train-
ing for the police 

and prosecutors, as well as the 
employment of special law enforce-
ment liaison officers who know how 
to respectfully receive and vigorous-
ly act on sexual assault complaints. 
Everything possible should be done 
to encourage victims to participate 
in a criminal investigation, includ-
ing colleges providing students with 
an attorney to accompany them to a 
meeting with the police to help them 
report the crime and ensure they are 
treated properly. The hearing pro-
cess should be put in the hands of 
trained investigatory personnel and 
people with criminal law experi-
ence, not University staff under the 
supervision of a Title IX coordinator.

While we need to adopt an effec-

tive system through which to prop-
erly represent the victims of sexual 
assault, it cannot be one that ignores 
the rights of the accused. The issue 
at hand has a long-standing history 
of imbalance, rife with injustice for 
victims of rape, but the solution is 
not to tip the scales in the opposite 
direction. Consideration and reeval-
uation should go into all pertinent 
university policies, as well as legis-
lation and federal laws.

Sexual assault 
at college and 
universities is a 
serious problem.

I

t’s a Thursday night at Good 
Time Charley’s. Well, tech-
nically, it’s Friday morning, 

but my table is 
too busy catch-
ing up to notice 
the time. We’re 
a strange group 
by 
Ann 
Arbor 

standards, 
tied 

together not by a 
shared freshman 
dorm or major or 
fraternity, but by a 
collective love for 
Washington, D.C.

Last January, we left our friends 

in Ann Arbor to live with 24 rela-
tively random strangers in the 
nation’s capital, started interning 
across the District and learned our 
way around the city. This January, 
the Michigan in Washington Win-
ter 2014 cohort is back at Michigan, 
substituting fishbowls for the $8 
Whale Pails we grew to love at our 
favorite Thursday-night spot, Sign 
of the Whale. Our last get-together 
was a poster session and post-D.C. 
dinner in September coordinated by 
the program; our group’s Facebook 
discussions have revolved around 
organizing a reunion ever since. 
Finally, this past Thursday night at 
Charley’s emerged as the winner for 
our anticipated reunion.

Seeing these people again brings 

back memories of running around 
the monuments, going to Wizards 
and Caps games, reliving freshman 
year through weekly dorm parties 
and inevitably ending up at Madhat-
ter every Friday and Saturday night. 
In D.C., we spent Saturday after-
noons checking out the cherry blos-
soms and watching the giant panda 
cub at the zoo. We all tried sneaking 
out of the Monday-night speaker 
series after grabbing free dinner, 

with mixed success. We spent week-
nights sharing stories about our 
internships while making dinner. 
Getting stopped on your way to class 
because the President was headed 
home and the roads needed to be 
cleared was normal while living 
four blocks from the White House.

Seeing this crew also reminds me 

of what is to come this fall: squish-
ing into the train on early-morning 
commutes, buying only as many gro-
ceries as two reusable bags will hold 
because six blocks stand between 
Whole Foods and the refrigera-
tor, 
and 
coordinating 
weekend 

plans because in a big city every-
one doesn’t 
live 
within 

a 20-minute 
walk. 
Col-

lege is end-
ing soon, and 
no 
matter 

how excited 
I am to head 
back to D.C., 
I still wish I 
could freeze 
time 
and 

keep everything the way it is, with a 
blank planner providing a lot of time 
to meet up with friends outside of 
the few random natural science and 
humanities credits I took in order to 
get my diploma.

The conversation turns to what 

we plan on doing once we gradu-
ate, because it’s second semester of 
senior year and it is impossible not 
to get asked this at least once a day. 
For some, it’s law school. It’s back to 
D.C. for others. A few are headed to 
jobs across the United States. In a few 
months, when we’ve settled into our 
new roles, the conversation will focus 
on how we plan to meet back up.

I can’t help but think about this 

reunion at Charley’s as a trial run 

for what happens after gradua-
tion, when we all leave the Big 
House together one last time. We’ve 
struggled to meet up on campus for 
months, and most of us still live in 
Ann Arbor — imagine how much 
more difficult it will be to see each 
other once we graduate.

This isn’t the only circle of friends 

I’ll be missing after graduation, 
either. I have my Ford School friends 
too, my sorority sisters and my cur-
rent roommates who I’ve known 
since freshman year. Each of these 
groups will try to make it back to Ann 
Arbor for a football game this fall, 
but how many people won’t be able 

to make it because 
of a work obligation, 
a pre-planned vaca-
tion or a grad-school 
paper? What happens 
when I’m the one who 
won’t be able to go?

A 
lot 
of 
the 

memories we laughed 
about 
at 
Charley’s 

on Thursday haven’t 
surfaced in a while. 
I 
don’t 
see 
these 

people every day in class or at work 
or at home, so I forget about the 
stupid stuff we did until we start 
to reminisce. I wonder what other 
things I don’t remember – what other 
memories from living in my sorority 
house or in South Quad I don’t think 
about until I see my friends and we 
start chatting. After graduation, 
when I don’t see these people for 
months on end, will the memories 
still come back to me as vividly when 
we finally get together? These are 
the moments that make college more 
than just a collection of classes and 
clubs. I don’t want to forget them.

Reunions — A trial run

Liberal thought police

TO THE DAILY:

There is now a red poster outside the 

Michigan Union touting a supposed smiley 
face whose lips are silenced (literally) and 
underneath are the words, “Liberal Thought 
Police.”

Well, talk about the need for a trigger 

warning. This poster mentions some lecture 
next week by a man named Jonah Goldberg. 
After Googling him, it turns out he’s a conser-
vative editor for National Review Online and 
wrote a book called “Liberal Fascism.”

And these people, the oxymoronic Young 

Americans for Freedom, have the white het-
eronormative privilege to feature this kind 

of speaker — a reactionary, free-market fun-
damentalist — and then condescendingly say 
that there are “liberal thought police” among 
us.

The fact that this University now has stu-

dents who will feature this speaker seems to 
strain far from what social justice demands 
— protecting oppressed identity groups from 
what they deem offensive.

I say that all decent liberals should go to 

Rackham Amphitheater, Feb. 12 at 7 p.m. to 
listen to Goldberg’s right-wing gobbledygook 
and then confront him in the Q&A and 
unmask the intellectual fascist this man and 
the people who support him really are.

University cancels class 

due to snowstorm

Late Sunday night, the 

University canceled class-
es for Monday due to in-
clement weather. This was 
the second time the Uni-
versity closed for weather-
related reasons since 1978.

The Division of Public 

Safety and Security issued 
a notice of Emergency Re-
duction in Operations on 
Sunday night. The alert 
said all classes and events 
would be canceled through 
6 p.m. Monday evening. 
Only the University hos-
pitals 
remained 
open.

The National Weather 

Service predicted south-
west Michigan would ex-
perience sub-zero wind 
chill and wind gusts up to 
30 mph. The University 
experienced 
more 
than 

14 inches of snow Sunday 
and early Monday, and a 
temperature-high of 15 de-
grees with a low of zero.

Protesters march after 

prosecutor declines to press 

charges against officer
The 
organization 

Ann Arbor to Ferguson 
marched through down-
town Ann Arbor on Satur-
day in protest of a recent 
legal 
decision 
parallel-

ing the case involving the 
death of Michael Brown 
in 
Ferguson, 
Missouri.

Participants protested 

in response the Washtenaw 
County 
Prosecutor 
Of-

fice’s decision not to press 
charges against Ann Arbor 
police officer David Ried 
following the fatal shoot-
ing of 40-year-old Ann Ar-
bor resident Aura Rosser.

The prosecutor’s office 

ruled that Ried acted in 
self-defense when he shot 
Rosser. The report from 
the hearing said Rosser 
charged toward Ried while 
carrying a knife. The re-
port also stated Rosser 
refused to drop the knife 
when ordered to do so.

Around the World

CDC worried about 

large measles outbreak
The Center for Disease 

Control is very concerned 
about the growing num-
ber of people in the United 
States who have not been 
vaccinated 
for 
measles.

According to CDC sta-

tistics, there are currently 
at least 102 reported cases 
of measles in 14 states.

In an interview with 

CBS on Sunday, CDC Direc-
tor Tom Frieden said while 
measles has been eliminat-
ed in the U.S. for the past 
15 years, the influx of dis-
ease comes from citizens 
traveling 
internationally.

Frieden said the num-

ber of measles cases is 
expected to grow, which 
will result in CDC tak-
ing more aggressive pub-
lic health action in order 
to isolate those infect-
ed and stop the spread.

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team hasn’t seen Iowa 
yet this season, but if his team’s 
status is any 
indication, 
coach 
John 

Beilein knows 
what’s coming 
when 
the 

Hawkeyes visit 
Crisler Center 
on 
Thursday 

night.

“If 
they 

watched 
our 

transition 
defense against 
Michigan 
State, whether we make a shot or 
not, they’re just going to attack 
us right down the floor,” Beilein 
said. “And that’s going to be a big 
emphasis for us going forward.”

In Sunday’s game at Michigan 

State, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 

outscored 16-8 in transition 
and lost in overtime, 76-66. 
Now, back at home, they’ll face 
another formidable test on the 
fast break.

“Defensive transition is the 

thorn in every coach’s side, 
because you’re trying to get 
better at it,” Beilein said. “It 
takes a lot of time in practice 
to really get good at it at a high 
speed. You can wear your team 
out practicing it so much.”

Fatigue is one thing Michigan 

can’t afford. In addition to foot 
injuries to junior guard Caris 
LeVert and sophomore guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., redshirt 
freshman forward Mark Donnal 
has been sidelined two straight 
games as he recovers from an 
illness.

If Donnal is still limited 

come 
Thursday, 
that 
leaves 

just freshman Ricky Doyle and 
senior Max Bielfeldt to match up 
with Iowa’s massive front line.

The Hawkeyes start 6-foot-9 

forward Aaron White, 6-foot-
9 forward Jarrod Uthoff and 
7-foot-1 center Adam Woodbury. 
They also go deep into their 
bench, rotating as many as 10 
players, none of whom averages 
more than 30 minutes per game. 
The substitutes include 6-foot-
10 
forward 
Gabriel 
Olaseni 

and 
6-foot-8 

forward Dom 
Uhl.

But 
the 

Wolverines’ 
big men have 
also 
been 

playing better 
as 
of 
late. 

Bielfeldt 
has 

averaged nine 
points and 7.8 
rebounds over 
the past four games, and Doyle is 
the team’s second-leading active 
scorer.

With the improvement on the 

interior and Iowa’s size, Beilein 
said he’d consider using two big 
men at once if their matchups 
presented 
an 
opportunity 

Thursday.

“I think it’s always going to 

be in our package somewhere,” 
Beilein said. “We’re limited in 
what we can run through that. 
We’re trying to work at that. You 
are who you can guard. We’ve 
got to see a matchup that Max or 
Ricky can go guard a perimeter 
defender for us to do it, unless 

we’re playing 
100 
percent 

zone, and then 
you get away 
with it.”

Zone 

defense 
is 

another 
option: 
Both 

Michigan’s 
2-3 and 1-3-1 
looks had been 
improving 

prior to Sunday. When the 
Wolverines tested them against a 
strong passing team in Michigan 
State, the Spartans broke them 
down and forced them into man-
to-man defense.

Michigan faces another older 

team Thursday — the Hawkeyes 
start a senior and three juniors 

and they bring two more seniors 
off the bench. Still, back in 
Crisler Center, the home-court 
environment could help close 
the gap in experience.

“It has so far — I think 

we’ve played pretty well at 
home,” Beilein said. “It’s the 
persistence that you see with 
teams that really have a great 
understanding of what it takes to 
win. We’re growing in that area 
in leaps and bounds.”

The Wolverines have lost 

in overtime twice in the past 
three games, but against top 
competition, they have been 
within a bounce here and there 
in both games.

“It’s tough, letting games 

like that slip away or having a 
game that close go the other 
way,” said junior guard Spike 
Albrecht. “I think I’ve kind of 
learned in my two years here, 
those things will come back to 
you. Just continue to do what 
we do, and we’re going to start 
getting some of those breaks. 
Things are going to start going 
our way.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan seeks 
rare win at MSU

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

With the Michigan women’s 

basketball team suffering its first 
pair of back-to-back conference 
losses 
this 

season, the Big 
Ten 
regular-

season title is 
out of reach.

But 
an 

NCAA 
Tournament 
bid is still a 
possibility, and 
the Wolverines 
can still save 
the 
season 

in 
the 
eight 

games 
before 

the Big Ten Tournament that will 
largely 
determine 
Michigan’s 

postseason 
fate, 
barring 
a 

tournament championship.

Thursday marks the beginning 

of an uphill and grueling road 
that the Wolverines (5-5 Big Ten, 
13-8 overall) will have to travel in 
order to dance in the postseason.

It’s a road that begins in East 

Lansing, where Michigan hasn’t 
won since Jan. 25, 2001.

Though this year’s Michigan 

State squad is not the powerhouse 
most are accustomed to, Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico isn’t 
underestimating the Spartans’ 
ability in their own house.

“It’s still Michigan State,” 

Barnes Arico told WTKA Radio 
on Tuesday. “They’ve been the 
premier program in the state, and 
that’s kind of our rival and what 
we aspire to be each and every 
single year.”

Michigan State (3-8, 11-11) 

holds a lopsided 63-17 edge in 
the all-time series against the 
Wolverines, 
who 
snapped 
a 

three-game losing streak to their 

in-state rival on Jan. 4 when 
the Spartans were No. 24 in the 
nation.

If 
Michigan 
can 
collect 

another victory, it will have 
swept the season series for the 
first time since the 1999-2000 
season — a feat reached just three 
times in the program’s history.

But as Barnes Arico put it, 

it’s still Michigan State, even if 
the Spartans sit at 11th in the 
conference standings.

Michigan 
State 
will 
rely 

heavily on guard Aerial Powers, 
who is averaging 21.9 and 12 
rebounds per game, 1.8 more 
boards 
than 
senior 
forward 

Cyesha Goree.

For 
Michigan, 
Goree 
has 

become less of a threat since the 
Wolverines’ loss to Maryland 
last week, scoring just six points 
against Nebraska on Sunday. 
Without her influence in the paint, 
Michigan turned to senior guard 
Shannon Smith in her stead.

Despite making a strong start 

against Nebraska, Michigan “ran 
out of gas in the second half,” 
according to Barnes Arico. For 
the Wolverines to continue to 
stay in competition with others 
around the conference, they’ll 
have to put together a full 40 
minutes of intensity and focus.

“I think this could be record-

breaking for the Big Ten,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Our league is the No. 
1 RPI league in the country right 
now, and we have some great out-
of-conference wins by the teams 
in our league.”

Barnes Arico doesn’t hesitate 

to call the Big Ten the best 
conference in the nation. Now, 
it’s up to her and her team to 
bounce back, like it has all year, 
to create a postseason berth.

And it starts 64 miles north 

against all odds.

The curious case of 
Max Shuart’s helmet

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

To the average hockey fan, it 

may seem that every Michigan 
hockey player looks exactly the 
same — all the players’ sticks, 
skates and, of course, uniforms 
make them look like mirror 
images.

But if you take a closer look 

at the Wolverines, one glaring 
difference exists: sophomore 
forward Max Shuart’s helmet.

While all of his teammates 

wear a full “cage” face shield — 
which looks like a wired fence — 
Shuart opts to wear a plastic face 
shield, also known as a “bubble” 
or a “fish bowl.” It effectively 
looks like a giant piece of clear 
plastic surrounding his face 
with a few notches cut out of the 
bottom for ventilation.

By not wearing a cage, Shuart, 

who has worn a bubble since his 
junior year of high school, feels 
left out.

“It’s a little weird being the 

only one,” Shuart said. “I get a 
little crap from the boys about 
it, but I just like it a lot better. 
I think it has better vision and I 
like the look of it a lot more than 
the cage.”

Unfortunately 
for 
Shuart, 

his teammates don’t share his 
sentiment. Last season, only 
then-junior Phil Di Giuseppe 
wore a bubble alongside Shuart. 
The bubble, the rest of his 
teammates say, fogs up too 
much and creates problems 
with water entering the helmet 
that are not worth the sleek 
look.

Things looked promising for 

Shuart heading into this season, 
when freshman forward Dexter 
Dancs opted to wear a bubble 
for the first couple of practices. 
But he quickly reverted back to 
wearing a cage.

Shuart knew it was time to 

get back to the drawing board.

“I don’t want to be the only 

one,” Shuart said. “It’s not by 
choice.”

Junior forward Andrew Copp 

doesn’t think Shuart minds, 
though. “He probably likes the 
attention,” he said.

Whatever the case, after 

a failed attempt with Dancs, 
Shuart scrambled and made a 
bet with sophomore forward JT 
Compher.

“If he had my next first assist 

on a goal before I had a next 
first 
assist 

on his goal, 
then I would 
have 
to 
put 

on a bubble,” 
Compher 
said. “I think 
I might have 
lost the bet. 
… 
Let’s 
just 

say it’s not on 
quite yet.”

Compher 

doesn’t have any plans to put on 
a bubble anytime soon, because 
both players are unsure of who 
actually won the bet. So Shuart 
knew he would have to come to 
terms with being the only one.

And it hasn’t been easy.
Because Shuart is the only 

Wolverine who dons a face 
shield, his teammates often joke 
with him by spraying water on 
his mask, prompting Shuart to 
take off his helmet to clean it.

Copp has a special infatuation 

for ticking off Shuart, and takes 
any opportunity he gets to mess 
with Shuart’s fish bowl.

“Copp … he likes to spray 

water on (my bubble),” Shuart 

said. “He likes to do it so I can’t 
see.”

But according to Copp, Shuart 

is overplaying the situation.

“I’ve only actually sprayed 

water on his bubble once,” Copp 
said. “But I always act like I’m 
going to do it and he’ll freak 
out.”

Luckily for Shuart, he has 

quickly caught 
on 
to 
his 

teammates’ 
antics. 
“You 

always have to 
keep a towel 
handy 
with 

the fish bowl,” 
he joked.

Come 

Saturday, 
things 
might 

change 
for 

Shuart. Michigan is playing 
an outdoor game at Solider 
Field — home of the Chicago 
Bears — where temperatures 
are supposed to be in the low 
30s. Wearing a bubble in such 
frigid temperatures could spell 
disaster.

Monday, 
while 
practicing 

outside at Buhr Park in Ann 
Arbor, simulating Saturday’s 
game 
conditions, 
Shuart 

admitted to having problems 
with fog and said he might have 
to wear a cage this weekend.

So 
for 
one 
game, 
the 

Wolverines may look like mirror 
images. And Shuart won’t feel 
so lonely.

TRAILER REVIEW

A little late for the Oscars, 

SpongeBob resurfaces on the 
big 
screen 

in his sec-
ond 
feature 

film: 
“The 

Sponge-
Bob 
Movie: 

Sponge Out 
of Water.” An 
evil 
pirate, 

played 
by 

Antonio 
Banderas 
(“Spy Kids”) 
(he’s back! and not in boots!), 
lays siege to Bikini Bottom to 
recover the final page of a book 
that will makes true whatever 
the author writes in its page. 
SpongeBob must go (ahem) out 
of water and into 3D animation 
to save the day.

Perhaps due to his spongy 

resilience, Spongebob has man-
aged to stay relevant to almost 
two generations of cartoon 
fans. Most Nickelodeon car-
toon shows come and go (e.g., 
“Rocko’s Modern Life”), but 
SpongeBob has merrily abided 
on the sunken shores of Bikini 

Bottom for nearly 16 years.

Unfortunately, 
either 

SpongeBob 
has 
changed 

or 
I 
have, 
because 
Mr. 

SquarePants 
doesn’t 
seem 

to have the same appeal as 
before: His yellow seems less 
yellow, his bubble obsession 
less hilarious, his steady job 
as fry cook a little bit weird. 
I’m left asking the questions 
I was too innocent to ask 
before: Why has SpongeBob, 
who’s apparently an adult, 
been working as a fry cook for 
16 years? Does Patrick have a 

mental disability? Does Squid-
ward suffer from depression?

Luckily, this motion pic-

ture isn’t aiming to please 
jaded college students like 
myself. It’s geared toward 
kids for whom SpongeBob is 
still new(ish); and for them, 
Patrick’s caveman stupidity, 
Squidward’s killjoy attitude, 
Gary’s meowing and Sponge-
Bob’s, 
well, 
squarepanted-

ness will be as funny and 
enjoyable as ever … Oh, and 
this time it’s in 3D!

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Rihanna is having a moment. 

She knows we’ve been a col-
lective nervous wreck waiting 
for her return to music, for the 
official 
start 

of 
the 
#R8 

era. Rihanna, 
aware of the 
fact that she 
has our atten-
tion, is letting 
herself have a 
moment. And 
that moment 
is 
“FourFi-

veSeconds.”

There’s 

a 
lot 
that 

feels 
oddly 

unexplained about this whole 
“FourFiveSeconds” thing: the 
grand departure in sound it rep-
resents for her, what it means for 
the rest of her imminent eighth 
album, what Paul McCartney 
is doing there, what the song is 
even about. The accompanying 
music video, released on Tues-
day, doesn’t do much to address 
the elephant in the room, 
though — what the fuck does 
Rihanna have up her sleeve?

Whatever is up there must 

be quite big, considering how 
baggy the vintage Sean John 
denim jacket (which, some-
what unsurprisingly, belongs to 
Kanye) is that she’s sporting in 
the clip. Directed by the famed 
Dutch duo of Inez van Lam-
sweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, 
who are known for their highly 
posed fashion photography, the 
“FourFiveSeconds” music video 
was shot completely in black 
and white using a square aspect-
ratio, perfect for @badgalriri’s 
Instagram account.

The video features the trio of 

denim-clad iconic artists using 
exaggerated hand and body ges-
tures to convey their feelings in 
front of a strategically-lit white 
backdrop, all the while looking 
quite beautiful themselves. The 
most striking points of the video 
are the tightly-shot close-ups 
of Rihanna and Kanye looking 
directly into the camera with a 
look that combines scorn with 
confidence, fear with excite-
ment. There’s a twinkle in 
their eyes — they know we’re 
part confused, part intrigued 
and part excited by the whole 
thing. What Inez and Vinoodh 
have created here is something 
special, and it’s very much in 
line with the sound of Kanye’s 
“Only One,” as well as with his 
Kardashian-induced obsession 
with high fashion. But, what 
remains (perhaps purposively) 
unclear is what is all means for 
Rihanna and the trajectory of 
this new era.

“FourFiveSeconds” 
has 

grown on me in ways I 
wouldn’t have expected, and 

the music video probably will, 
too. But my favorite moment 
from the entire video hap-
pens just eighteen seconds in 
after Rihanna sings “I might 
do a little time” as she looks 
directly at us, her powerful 
stare piercing the camera. 
After a pause, she rolls her 
eyes hard. Part of what’s great 
about this moment is that it 
sort of reflects my feelings 
about “FourFiveSeconds:” I’m 
entertained, I’m enjoying it, 
but I’m also kind of over it. I 
want to see what’s next. The 
other reason that this moment 
stands out is because it’s just 
that — a moment — and it’s 
one that reassures us that 
the Rihanna we love — the 
fierce, unapologetic RiRi that 
doesn’t give a shit about what 
anyone thinks — is ready to 
return. It’s a flash of brilliance 
that allows us to be okay with 
indulging her in this moment, 
just as long as it only lasts 
about four or five seconds.

ROC NATION

National Harbor, Md. — “WEL-

COME BACK, BRO! WELCOME 
BACK 
TO 
THE 
BIG 
DICK 

PARTY!”

Less than two minutes after 

checking into the convention and 
getting my badge, two very drunk 
and very happy geeks had their 
arms around me.

“Thanks, I appreciate it.”
I looked over to where the two 

lanky fellows were walking. Sev-
eral other inebriated gamers were 
hammering away at gamepads, 
huddled in front of 20-inch HD 
monitors.

I was hoping it would be longer 

before the MAGFest culture shock 
set in. I had three newcomers with 
me (my girlfriend and two of my 
best friends), and I wanted their 
transition into convention culture 
to be smoother than it was. Per-
haps a subtler welcome wagon to 
a first con experience than two 
touchy-feely “Guilty Gear” players 
would have been nice.

“MAGFest is so many things to 

so many different people. I some-
times like to say that MAGFest 
doesn’t exist, there are actually 15 
events going on at the same time 
in the same building” said Nicho-
las Marinelli, the promotions and 
public relations official of MAG-
Fest.

“My business card says ‘promo-

tions and public relations,’ but real-
ly, it’s everything. MAGFest has a 
very flat organizational structure; 
it’s not very deep hierarchically. 
I’m on the Board of Directors; I’m 
the only one that really does the 
promo.”

The Music and Games Festival 

happens once a year in the Gay-
lord National Resort and Conven-
tion Center in National Harbor, 
Maryland, — a kitschy, ritzy town 
of restaurants, bars and oversize 
convenience 
stores 
seemingly 

constructed entirely around the 
hotel’s economy. It’s a 30-minute 
drive from Washington D.C., and 
it likely wouldn’t exist if not for 
the hundreds of office retreats and 
trade shows that happen in the 
Gaylord Hotel yearly.

Marinelli 
summarized 
the 

event quite well: “It’s a four-day 
long party dedicated to video game 
music and gaming of all types.”

MAGFest 2015 was the 13th 

event of its name. Well, of its acro-
nym. Originally called the Mid-
Atlantic Gaming Festival, it was 
“back-ronymed” to Music and 
Games Festival a few years into its 
life.

For one weekend a year, Nation-

al Harbor is a different planet. It’s 
a 96-hour party that never sleeps. 
It’s a festival. It’s a convention. It’s 
absolutely insane.

But you might not want to call 

it a convention. On MAGFest’s 
website, it explicitly states that 
MAGFest is not a convention, it’s a 
festival.

“That’s me. Everyone always 

busts my ass for it, every time 
they say convention I say festival!” 
Marinelli said. “I’ve been going 
to anime conventions since high 
school, and then after you’ve been 
going to these things for however 
long, you start to ... it’s a different 
crowd at MAGfest. Anime conven-
tions are fun especially if you’re 
into that, but MAGfest is a bit of 
an older crowd, it’s a more relaxed, 
less manic crowd. I mean, the fes-

tival thing is really just a tagline, 
and if the IRS asks, we’re a con-
vention. It’s basically just meant 
to denote that it’s not your typical 
anime convention.”

Later in the interview, I mistak-

enly said “convention” again, and 
Marinelli promptly corrected me. 
Despite the reluctance to call it a 
convention, there’s actually quite 
a lot about MAGFest that’s consis-
tent with convention culture.

The music festival and gaming 

con aspects of MAGFest coexist 
fairly well. The hotel certainly has 
its standard gaming con accom-
modations: gigantic show floors 
lined with expensive arcade cabi-
net collections; panels featuring 
YouTube gaming celebrities like 
JonTron, The Angry Video Game 
Nerd and Game Grumps; areas 
for tabletop games; and of course, 
huge tournaments.

Simultaneously, a big part of 

the hotel is a dedicated music 
exhibition. There’s a jam space for 
impromptu band formation for 
congoers (read that as con-goers 
or congo-ers, either works) and 
a giant concert hall where virtu-
ally every major videogame cover 
band (as well as many hopeful DJs) 
comes to put on what has to be 
their favorite show of the year — I 
can’t see how playing for the exact 
niche audience your music was 
made for wouldn’t be.

As a frequent listener of video 

game music, it was pretty damn 
incredible to attend an event dedi-
cated to its exhibition. The suc-
cess of MAGFest is a testament 
to the genre’s diversity and lon-
gevity. Even so, it can be difficult 
to explain what makes the genre 
great — or even listenable — to 
people not in the know. Marinelli 

MAGFEST
From Page 1B

credits the appeal of the genre to 
the frequently limited tools game 
composers work with to improve 
their craft.

“It had very complex, inter-

weaving melodies and harmonies. 
When a composer is forced to cre-
ate music under those strict limita-
tions, he or she has to make damn 
sure it sounds good, otherwise 
you’re just gonna want to mute it, 
and that’s something that always 
appealed to me about it,” Marinelli 
said. “It’s cool that the constraints 
made it so that the composer had 
to exercise their creativity as much 
as they could, yet at the same time, 
the simplicity of the sound palette 
made it so that today you could 
have so many different interpre-
tations of the same song, and they 
could all be so radically different 
that you could listen to the same 
song 10 times in a row and not get 
tired of it.”

There’s 
not 
much 
synergy 

between the “music festival” and 
“gaming con” sides of MAGFest, 
other than the ability to stroll 
between the two sides of the event 
at will. But perhaps it’s the overall 
culture of MAGFest that’s syner-
gistic.

So, apparently conventions have 

their own culture? They do, and it’s 
fascinating to witness, especially 
within the walls of an ornate hotel.

What people don’t fully under-

stand about geek conventions 
and festivals like MAGFest is that 
normal societal and social rules 
simply don’t apply to them. Obvi-
ously, courtesy and civility are 
still norms, but the ground rules of 
human interaction are inherently 
different.

For one thing, people will dance 

anywhere. Amateur DJs seemed to 
have speaker setups blasting elec-
tronic music (often video-game-
themed) from every hallway in the 
Gaylord National Resort. Around 
them, small groups of sweaty guys 
and girls could be seen rollicking 
back and forth around their seg-
ment of carpeted hotel floor. I’ve 
never seen people dance like they 
do at conventions. None of them 
ever look like they actually know 
how to dance, but they move and 
jump and sing with the confidence 
of professionals.

Another oddity is the domi-

nance of cosplay. Like many con-
vention settings, around a third of 
the MAGFest attendees engaged in 
some form of cosplay — dressing 
in elaborate costumes emulating 
video game, comic book and anime 
characters. There’s no doubt that 
conventions are absolutely the 
greatest people-watching events 
in the world. Sitting or standing 

virtually anywhere in the event is 
like watching a costume parade, a 
rainbow of pop culture idolization, 
fur suits and out-there fashion.

I have to imagine that MAGFest 

is either a nice break or a royal pain 
in the ass for the hotel staff. For 
one weekend of the year, instead 
of having to deal with stuffy white 
people in suits, they instead cater 
to Hatsune Miku, the Raccoon City 
Police Department, Rei Ayanami, 
Belly Dancing Toads and the entire 
roster of Super Smash Bros.

This probably sounds like it 

would be pretty overwhelming 
to those not familiar with the con 
scene. You don’t have to be familiar 
with convention culture to appre-
ciate the event, though. Marinelli 
noted that there are so many niche 
interests represented at MAGFest 
that it would be difficult not to 
enjoy any of them.

“Video gamers enjoy MAG-

Fest, tabletop gamers, LARPers, 
cosplayers, musicians, people who 
like watching YouTube, academ-
ics, game designers, game com-
posers, artists, crafters. There’s all 
these areas at MAGFest that you 
don’t necessarily see anywhere 
else,” Marinelli said.

Perhaps the most refreshing 

aspect of MAGFest — and the 
aspect most noticeable while sim-
ply walking around the event — is 
its absolute dedication to promot-
ing 
inclusivity. 
MAGFest 
has 

absolutely the most diverse array 
of identities I’ve seen at a conven-
tion. While cons are normally 
portrayed in media as thoroughly 
white and male (for example, the 
Star Wars convention in Kevin 
Smith’s “Chasing Amy”), MAGFest 
entirely transcends that stereo-
type. MAGFest is a convention of 
geeks, to be sure, but its geeks are 
a rainbow of colors and sexualities, 
with an almost-equal gender ratio.

“We had a lot of different kinds 

of people coming into MAGFest 
(the last few years), it’s quite differ-
ent from what it used to be when 
it was a bunch of smelly dudes,” 
Marinelli said. “I’m not exactly 
sure how that happened, but I’m 
very glad it did because we’ve 
evolved into this very diverse, 
safe space where people of any 
size, shape, gender, color, religion 
and whatever can come and feel 
welcome. It’s part of our code of 
conduct, our harassment policy, 
that we don’t take any shit when it 
comes to ragging on people for any 
reason.”

To me, MAGFest even tran-

scends “college pamphlet” diver-
sity. It’s not just people of different 
races and genders. MAGFest is the 
most inclusive event I’ve maybe 

ever attended because it’s tolerant 
of different lifestyles, ideals, man-
ners of speech and more. It’s no 
wonder those dancers looked so 
confident — they felt safe and free.

“We have people in fur suits 

walking around our event. What-
ever!” Marinelli said. That’s their 
bag, that’s what they do. I’m not 
gonna … I’ve actually learned a 
lot about that, because you know, 
most people’s exposure to fur suits 
is CSI, when they had the furry 
orgy (episode) or whatever. And 
it turns out, people who wear fur 
suits just really like Ninja Turtles 
and Star Fox. Like, all right, that’s 
cool, I can get behind that. I’m glad 
that so many people are welcome 
at the event, because in the current 
age of the Internet we live in, it is 
sometimes said that we shouldn’t 
need diverse representation of 
people in gaming, and I think 
that’s 100 percent false.”

Marinelli explained to me that 

the convention has difficulty cap-
turing and selling people on the 
sprawling range of niche interests 
that MAGFest caters to.

“When I first took on the role of 

a main promo guy, I was really bad 
at it. Not that I’m not still bad at it, 
because I kept playing up the video 
game music angle. That’s what it 
was to me. I didn’t quite realize at 
the time how many different fac-
ets there are to MAGFest and how 
many different ways there are to 
enjoy it,” Marinelli said.

“When I finally twisted one 

friend’s arm into final coming, he 
thought it was the greatest thing 
ever. He said, ‘Why didn’t you tell 
me all these arcade machines were 
here? This is so cool!’ And now 
he’s the head of our merchandise 
department. It just goes to show 
that no matter what your niche is, 
you’re probably going to find it at 
MAGFest. Unless it’s 19th century 
French literature. I don’t know 
what to tell you there.”

There was no lack of conversa-

tion in my car during the eight-
hour car trip back to Ann Arbor. In 
fact, I’m pretty sure we could have 
gone for far longer reminiscing 
about what we just experienced.

If not for the wonderful culture 

of fun and inclusivity or the panels 
of famous YouTube stars, MAG-
Fest is absolutely worth attending 
just to see. The endless parade of 
congoers in immaculate home-
made costumes, the seemingly 
endless line of old-school arcade 
machines, the many after-par-
ties in Gaylord hotel rooms with 
enthusiastic and excited people 
that are colorful in every sense of 
the word — MAGFest has to be 
seen to be believed.

Fiat, owner

beam a cover of that old Woody 
Guthrie song into over 200 million 
American ears last Sunday in the

showing images of the company’s

North Face had the exact same

small bit of good perhaps came out 
of this act of vandalism.

But let me say this first: Anyone 

who in 2015 still loudly complains 
about bands “selling out” to corpo-
rate interests is simply very stub-
born or very naïve. If I had no fear 
and knew where to look on the 
Internet, I could download all of 
Matt and Kim’s music for free, and 
I can even legally stream all their 
songs on Spotify, a company that 
seems to pay artists pennies even 
for thousands of streams. There’s 
no way Matt and Kim, an indie 
duo in the middle tier of popular-

ity, are raking in cash from tradi-
tional music sales, so I understand 
if they want to add significantly to 
their income by licensing a song 
to Buick, even if it’s then used for 
an annoyingly ubiquitous adver-
tising campaign. It’s relatively 
easy money for people who work 
very hard at their jobs. Artists can 
choose to do whatever they want 
with their art, and any fan who 
tries to claim ownership of a song, 
even if he or she absolutely loves it, 
is missing the point.

Artists do have to be cognizant 

of how their work will come to 
be heard in the public conscious-
ness, however. Los Campesinos! 
is one of my favorite bands, and 
“You! Me! Dancing!” is one of their 
best songs, but I hate that I have 
to think of Budweiser every time 
I hear the first 30 seconds. Same 
with “Walk on the Wild Side” and 
HP computers. Even Bob Dylan 
does advertising now, from bizarre 
Victoria’s Secret ads to “Fuck yeah, 
Detroit!” Chrysler monologues to 
licensing “I Want You” to a Choba-
ni spot. Victoria’s Secret perhaps 
notwithstanding, I don’t think 
Dylan’s legacy has suffered at all 
from advertising. To be honest, it’s 
maybe even increased his visibility 
for a new generation.

Where I start to get uneasy is 

when the original artists are long 
gone and aren’t getting any pay-
ment for their songs. I don’t have 
anything against Jeep — it had a 
cool waterfall at the Detroit Auto 
Show that I really enjoyed when I 
was a little kid — or against North 
Face — its gloves kept me from 
losing fingers to frostbite dur-
ing last weekend’s blizzard — but 
neither of these companies had 
Woody Guthrie’s permission to 
use “This Land is Your Land.” The 
iconic folk singer died in 1967, and 
“This Land is Your Land” is in the 
public domain. While the idea of 
public domain is entirely neces-
sary, and sometimes ads featuring 
long dead songs can reinvigorate a 

legacy, no company should have a 
license to misappropriate artistic 
genius.

When 
Bruce 
Springsteen 

played “This Land is Your Land” 
live, he called it “an angry song.” 
Originally written as a response 
to Irving Berlin’s sleepy, overly 
sentimental “God Bless America,” 
Guthrie’s lyrics reveal his com-
munist leanings: “There was a 
high wall there that tried to stop 
me / A sign was painted said: Pri-
vate Property, / But on the back 
side it didn’t say nothing / This 
land was made for you and me.” 
The result, as Springsteen contin-
ues, is “one of the most beautiful 
songs ever written.”

It seems clear that both Fiat 

and North Face weren’t igno-
rant of this part of the song, but 
rather knew of these lyrics and 
chose to ignore them. The Jeep 
commercial cuts that verse out, 
but the North Face one edits 
the verses, changing “Private 
Property” to “No Trespassing” 
to make the words more com-
mercially rebellious and less 
straight-up socialist. And while 
it may sometimes feel like “This 
Land Is Your Land” is one of 
those songs like, say, “Yankee 
Doodle” — an iconic American 
song that doesn’t really have 
a true author — “This Land Is 
Your Land” was, in fact, written 
by an identifiable person, one of 
the greatest writers of the 20th 
century. To misquote an art-
ist and change his words with-
out his permission, as these 
companies have done in their 
advertisements, is vicious and 
unethical.

But hey, I wouldn’t be pay-

ing attention to these ads if they 
weren’t unethical. So maybe 
they worked.

Theisen is still perplexed by 

Bob Dylan’s Victoria’s Secret 

ad. To help sort him out,

Capturing the art 
of Detroit boxing

University senior 
photographs youth 

boxing gym 

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

Names of Detroit students have 

been changed to respect the privacy 
of individuals mentioned.

In order to get to the east side of 

Detroit by 4:30 p.m., Art & Design 
Senior Katie Moran leaves campus 
an hour early, usually returning by 
8 p.m. She makes this trip three 
times a week, averaging between 
10 and 15 hours. With gas prices 
around two dollars, that’s up to 
$40 in gas. Evidently, her schedule 
is unusual for a senior; no four-day 
weekends or wide-open nights for 
early bar trips or Netflix binges.

Instead, Moran spends these 

hours with a camera, 60 students 
between the ages of seven and 18, 
homework and boxing gloves. It 
must be a very unique place that 
can give meaning to such a unique 
combination, you might be think-
ing. Well, “unique” doesn’t even 
cut it. “Magic” might be more 
appropriate.

Welcome to the Downtown 

Youth Boxing Gym, a highlight 
of Detroit. Carlos Sweeny (pretty 
much exclusively known as “Coach 
Khali”) opened the gym eight years 
ago to help other boys and girls in 
his neighborhood avoid facing the 
dangers and struggles that he did 
as a young man. In a city in which 
the high school graduation rate is 
65 percent, Coach Khali’s gym has 
seen nearly every single one of its 
students graduate — 96 percent, to 
be exact. The other four percent 
are employed or in trade school. 
Besides their academic success, 
the entire travel team is nationally 
ranked.

To box in the ring, students 

must first be tutored. Everyone 
who works at the gym — Coach 
Khali, the trainers and tutors — 
are volunteers, including Moran. 
When students come in, they are 
offered one-on-one academic sup-
port and guidance, a free meal and 
training. Boxing is the reward and 
the motivator.

While the gym serves 65 stu-

dents, the waitlist is nearly 400 
students long. As a nonprofit 
organization, the gym runs on 
donations to keep it on its feet. 
Although there is a significant out-
of-pocket cost for maintaining the 
gym, donations have allowed for 
the purchase of a new, larger space 
that they will relocate to soon.

As a senior in the School of Art 

and Design, Moran is required to 
complete a 12-credit Integrated 
Project, or IP, which is essentially 
a yearlong senior thesis. Students 
are provided with two faculty 
advisors, a studio space and little 
else but the instructions “Do what-
ever you want!”

She knew her medium would 

be 
documentary 
photography, 

and she hoped to find a way to tell 
a story about Detroit, something 
that would hit close to home for 
people. Moran’s father had been a 
Golden Gloves boxer growing up 
in a rough neighborhood in Chi-
cago’s South Side, and he inspired 
her with stories about how the 
ring became a place where youths 
could take out their frustra-
tions, instead of on the streets or 
at school. Moran wanted to find 
one of these places. With some 
research, she came across Coach 
Khali’s TEDx talk.

“He talked about the way that 

the gym was a safe haven from all 
the other shit that happens out-
side. Some of these kids have so 
much going on around them and at 
home, and it’s this place that builds 
community. So I went there and 
fell in love immediately,” Moran 
said.

Aside from tutoring, Moran 

takes photographs: of the boxing, 
of the tutor room, of kids with 
their parents, their interactions 
with the coach and of the people 
who are constantly coming in and 
out.

“In my photographs, I’m really 

trying to show the community 
that’s built around this space. In a 
place like Detroit where govern-
ment has failed so many times, it’s 
interesting to see how people come 
together and work together for the 
greater good,” Moran said.

What began as a project about 

boxing and its role in keeping kids 
off the streets of Detroit has come 
to be something else. The project is 
no longer about boxing, although it 
is an important aspect. Instead, it’s 
about the way people support each 
other, regular stories about regu-
lar people doing special things.

“A lot of the things I hear are 

just funny. I was talking to a third 
grader, Will, and we were talk-
ing about birthdays. I told him to 
guess how old I was. He said ‘54?’ I 
finally told him I was going to be 23 
and he goes, ‘I hope my homework 
is right …,’ ” Moran said, laughing.

Other stories come close to 

bringing tears instead. She tells of 

another student whose house was 
damaged in a fire. After a porch 
nearly fell on him one afternoon 
taking out the trash, the family 
moved.

“There are days I come home 

crying. I’ve never experienced 
anything like that. And you can 
tell they’ve never been asked some 
of these questions,” Moran said.

We talked about bubbles: The 

way that Ann Arbor and the Uni-
versity are a bubble. Detroit is a 
bubble, too. With her camera and 
sound recorder in hand, Moran 
floats back and forth between 
these bubbles. Her project is 
intended to break some of these.

“The first time I went, I was 

pulling out in my car and this girl 
taps my window and she asked 
me, ‘Do you think we’re interest-
ing?’ And I said, ‘Yes I really, really 
do.’ She asked why and I just said 
I loved all of the great things hap-
pening here.”

The gallery space will be in 

Detroit, so that the entire gym 
community will have the opportu-
nity to see their story told through 
Moran’s photographs and accom-
panying sound stories.

Moran’s project is a chance to 

show people that Detroit can be 
revived and that people like Coach 
Khali are dedicating their lives to 
doing so. It is equally a chance to 
show these kids the importance of 
their experiences and what is hap-
pening in their homes.

Coach Khali wakes up at 5:00 

a.m. to get to the studio and begin 
organizing for the day. He is on 
call for the remaining hours, often 
picking up students from school. I 
watched the TEDx talk that Moran 
referred to. I think that word “pas-
sion” gets thrown around, but it is 
difficult to mistake when you see 
it.

“We’re doing more than making 

fighters, we’re making good peo-
ple,” Coach Khali says in the video, 
with a casual air of conviction that 
seems impossible to question.

After so many movies and even 

last week’s Super Bowl, it’s inspir-
ing to see what real champions 
look like.

EPISODE REVIEW

Of the 16 original contes-

tants on NBC’s “Celebrity 
Apprentice,” the entrepre-
neurial 
com-

petition 
overseen 
by 
mac-

daddy 
Donald 
Trump, 
only seven 
remain 
after 
this 

week’s epi-
sode. 
Not 

only 
are 

the teams 
shrink-
ing, 
but 

Trump has definitely upped 
the ante: Instead of selling 
pies, contestants now have 
to sell Trump’s luxury Doral-
Miami hotel, while showcas-
ing the resort’s features with 
an interactive model. Judged 

by Trump’s stone-faced sons, 
Team Infinity won the chal-
lenge with their “attention 
to luxury,” while Team Vor-
tex, headed by Kate Gosselin 
(“Kate Plus 8”), didn’t live 
up to Trump’s standards. As 
a result, Gosselin was fired. 
For the second challenge, the 
teams had to captain a boat 
tour around New York City; 

the winning team was deter-
mined by the passengers’ rat-
ings. High expectations were 
held for “Deadliest Catch” 
Captain Sig Hansen, but his 
Hooters-themed party boat 
wasn’t received well by the 
family-friendly 
visitors 
— 

sinking Hansen right out of 
the competition.

SINGLE REVIEW

“The best room they have is 

the last room you want” – what 
an 
interesting, 

possibly 
meta-

phorical lyric. Is 
Modest Mouse 
referring to a 
general and con-
tinuing 
disap-

pointment with 
the unsatisfacto-
ry nature of most 
supposed luxu-
ries that most 
Western 
countries 
contain? 

Or is it another line in a song 
about unhappiness the band 
has decided to deliver through 
the cacophonous vocals of lead 
singer Isaac Brock?

The uneducated, more ran-

dom Modest Mouse fans may 
remain 
unsure. 
The 
other 

patient fans, the ones who have 
waited the long eight years 
since the band’s last album, will 
know that most Modest Mouse 
songs — especially the penulti-
mate ones — carry both a mean-
ing and an awesome indie rock 
beat.

“The Best Room” is a tale 

of typically “Western” mod-
ern concerns that buries the 
beholder until he’s drowning 
in anxiety and exhaustion. 
Or at least I think so. Instru-
mentally, the song holds the 
quintessential Modest Mouse 
sounds that are reminiscent 
of early ’00’s classics like 
“Missed the Boat” or “The 
World At Large.” A strong beat 
supported by longtime band 
drummer 
Jeremiah 
Green 

balances the quick climaxes 
and depressions of the song. 
These fast changes, the heavy 

electric guitar influence and 
confusing yet distinctly mean-
ingful lyricism recreates the 
distinct sound that makes 
Modest Mouse so sonically 
recognizable.

If this newest single is in 

any way indicative of what the 
upcoming album holds, the Seth 
Cohen-ites and indie rockers of 
the millennial generation can 
start to breathe a little more 
deeply, and maybe release some 
of that pent up anxiety that 
eight long years can bring.

STYLE COLUMN

Loving TV for the 

Herve Leger

I

had a lot of ideas for this 
column. Relevant, inter-
esting ideas like “the 

importance of couture,” “the 
rise of Instagram models” and 
“what really 
is Men’s 
Fashion 
Week?” Is it 
like couture 
and ready-
to-wear all 
in one? Is 
there always 
full frontal 
nudity? 
Where are 
the Cara Delevingnes and Ken-
dall Jenners of men’s fashion? 
Is there always full frontal 
nudity?

As I attempted to ration my 

thoughts and organize them 
into what could be considered 
a cohesive piece of journal-
ism, I found myself 35 minutes 
deep into the third episode of 
“Empire,” FOX’s new night-
time musical soap opera of 
sorts. For those who know 
how to manage their time and 
not get sucked into the void 
that is Hulu, “Empire” follows 
hip-hop mogul Lucious Lyon 
(Terrence Howard, “Hustle 
& Flow”) and his musically 
inclined but unstable fam-
ily as they navigate a music 
industry where Cuba Gooding 
Jr. (“Selma”) is a former song-
writer-turned-rancher-turned 

songwriter/rancher. Yeah, it’s 
that good.

But that’s not exactly how 

I got sucked in. Enter: Cookie 
(Taraji P. Henson, “The Curi-
ous Case of Benjamin Button”). 
The ex-wife of Lucious who 
spent almost 20 years in prison 
after being busted for drugs 
— the drugs that helped build 
Lucious’s early career and the 
Empire … well, empire. She’s 
loud, smart, quick and assertive 
— with a wardrobe to match. 
Tight dresses, blinding sequins, 
bold accessories and enough 
animal print to make a 2003 
Raven Symone fall to her knees 
and weep, all in one episode.

This isn’t the first time 

I’ve been drawn into a series 
through the closets of its char-
acters. There are, of course, 
the obvious choices — the 
shows that ended up being just 
as much about the clothes as 
they were about the stories. 
With shows like “Gossip Girl,” 
clothes became the savior. 
While I tapped out around sea-
son four, because I could only 
suspend my disbelief for so long 
and there’s just no way in hell 
Blair would have dated Dan, 
I stuck around longer than I 
should have solely to see what 
Blair would wear on her head 
or to finally see Jenny’s trans-
formation into a stick of black 
eyeliner and fishnets.

Then there are shows like 

“The Mindy Project,” which 
really doesn’t need an added 
element of style — Mindy could 
wear scrubs every episode 
and the show would still make 
sense, and I would still tune 
in. But every time Dr. Lahiri 
wears a Herve Leger bodycon 
dress with snakeskin Giuseppe 
Zanotti heels to a medical 
conference or slings a Chanel 
crossbody bag over her shoul-
der as she walks into her office, 
I remember why I don’t just 
like, but love, Mindy Lahiri.

As for “Empire,” I would still 

probably watch it even if Cook-
ie wasn’t walking into business 
meetings in cocktail dresses. 
There are enough secret ill-
nesses, Naomi Campbell cam-
eos and bibbed-up blowjobs 
to keep me coming back week 
after week. But none of those 
reasons are why I’m writing 
this column, and they’re not 
why I’m texting my friends 
about post-prison wardrobes 
and they’re not why people 
are making slideshows to dis-
sect only Cookie’s “bad bitch” 
outfits. Though Cookie’s style 
may not suit everyone’s taste, it 
does prove a major point: If you 
want to create a strong, stand-
out character, you’re going to 
have to raid a few closets.

Daily Arts Writer

Sitting in the chilly storage 

room of Legion Menswear on 
North Main, I watch a few men 
tinker with a garment steamer. 
As an onlooker, I ignorantly ask 
if it’s an iron and get a laughter-
stained “steamer” in response 
from the band’s bass player Bren-
dan James. Congregated, they 
can’t take their focus off it, liken-
ing its long cords to those of an 
IV and chuckling coolly. I laugh, 
fascinated by their interest in the 
funny-looking 
appliance. 
The 

mundane is something they’re 
not used to — at least, not lately.

Grizfolk, a five-piece band 

rooted in Los Angeles and 
Sweden, have been booking it 
on the road since 2012. After 
wrapping up two juggernaut 
tours with British label-mates 
Bastille in 2014, complete with 
two sold-out shows at Radio 
City Music Hall, they’re now 
embarking on their own modest 
tour and wrapping up a full-
length album. I sat down with 
singer Adam Roth, synth-master 
Sebastian 
Fritze, 
guitarist 

Fredrik Eriksson, bass guitarist 
Brendan James and drummer 
Bill Delia one frozen afternoon 
before a pop-up show at Legion 
(and a legitimate one at the 
Blind Pig later that evening) to 
talk about all things ABBA and, 
of course, their own journey.

“We’ve all kind of known each 

other for, you know, a little bit of 
time,” Roth said. “I was in a band 
with Brendan and Bill before this 
band, and me and Fredrik had 
like a songwriting team, and we 
were trying to write for other 
artists. Then we met Sebastian, 
and we started writing and 
ended up kind of turning it into a 
band. So we hollered at Bill and 
Brendan and started Grizfolk.”

I asked them when this 

formation took place. After a 
little silence, Delia looked to 
Roth.

“Was that, like, ’79?” Delia 

said.

More laughter ensued, and 

Fritze, a native Swede, leaned 
into me.

“It was like three years ago,” 

Fritze said.

Grizfolk is on the riper side, 

but the boys’ relationship with 
music 
and 
their 
individual 

instruments stretches back to 
childhood. Fritze and Roth were 
persuaded by family at a young 
age to start playing, as was Delia.

“I started on the piano, and 

then when I was about eight 

maybe or nine I really wanted to 
start playing the drums,” Delia 
said. “So I built a drum set out of 
like shoeboxes and tin cans and 
stuff. And I played on that all the 
time.”

James’s passion was realized 

by peer pressure.

“Two of my friends were 

starting a band, and I’d never 
played anything in my life,” 
James said. “They’d both played 
guitar, so they were like, ‘You 
have to play the bass guitar.’ So 
that’s how I learned how to play 
the bass. I was forced into it, as 
well. We started a band called 
Upper Hand. I drew the logo. 
It was four slashes and then a 
thumb across.”

I complimented his artistry as 

Roth lifted his hand into the air 
to simulate an “upper hand.”

“Yeah, we were gonna be 

huge,” James said.

Grizfolk released their first 

EP, From the Spark, in February 
2014. Roth said the group’s 
muse was simply the newness of 
the experience, as much of the 
content on the EP was virginal, 
composed of the first songs they 
ever wrote as a band. Crafted in 
the indie comfort of bedrooms 
and the like, the compilation is 
etched with raw qualities.

“We weren’t pressured into 

being in a big studio. A big studio 
costs a lot of money,” Fritze 
said. “So the freedom of just like 
taking our time and figuring out 
what we wanted to do was a big 
part of how it turned out to be, 
the sound.”

Their 
songwriting 
process 

is just as unique — inspiration 
can strike anywhere, anytime, 
anyplace.

“When we write songs, we 

think about a landscape, usually. 
It could be anything like the 
barrens to deep, green forests, 
or whatever. And we figure out 
what that landscape would sound 
like and then write a story in that 
landscape. That’s like the first 
little spark that happens,” Fritze 
said.

On 
“Cosmic 
Angels,” 
an 

acoustic number, Roth summons 

a cathartic brand of songwriting.

“When I first had the idea 

for that song I had the woman 
at the time that I was trying 
to, like, pull into my life,” Roth 
said. “So I channel that like 
inner, beginning-of-love phase, 
you know, when you’re trying 
to court someone into your life, 
and you’re kind of willing to do 
whatever it takes.”

Expounding 
on 
sound, 
I 

inquired about the albums that 
had the biggest impact on each 
member. Nirvana’s Nevermind 
was mentioned, as were others 
from Bon Iver, Aerosmith and 
The Band. The boys said all have 
seeped into Grizfolk’s sound 
— even Eriksson’s selection of 
ABBA’s Greatest Hits.

Fusion of unlikely genres is a 

focus on their developing album. 
The process of making it was 
a test of faith for the band, who 
had to place its trust in recording 
studios and sound engineers as 
opposed to bedrooms.

“It’s kind of like all over the 

place,” Roth said, regarding the 
album. “It’s hard to really put my 
finger on what it sounds like. It’ll 
sound like Grizfolk, but none of 
the songs really sound alike.”

In their song “Vagabonds” on 

From the Spark, Roth sings about 
“running away from the little 
things.” I asked the vagabonds 
themselves 
what 
they 
were 

running away from.

“It’s not about running away. 

It’s about like going to places 
where you don’t really know 
what’s going to be there; you don’t 
know what’s going to happen 
there,” Fritze said. “I think that’s 
a cool way of living your life 
because you’re in the moment, 
right there. You’re not like 
expecting anything. You don’t 
have the high expectations. If 
you don’t have any expectations, 
then hopefully everything will 
turn out good. I think that’s what 
it’s about — not about just like 
running away from something. 
It’s 
more 
of 
searching 
for 

something.”

A few minutes later, around 

30 devoted fans (mainly girls) 
trickled onto Legion’s open floor. 
Subtle gasps and fidgeting hands 
lined the crowd as the boys came 
out, one by one. After one tune, 
Grizfolk asked what the audience 
wanted to hear next. Someone 
said, “The Ripple,” and soon the 
band broke out into their first ever 
acoustic performance of the song.

I watched the crowd sway as 

they sang.

“Oh oh, my my, gotta get lost to 

get it right.”
