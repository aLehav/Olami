At 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Alumni 
Center 

Thursday evening, about 80 
students, alumni and members 
of the Ann Arbor community 
attended the first event of this 
year’s LatinX Heritage Month 
celebrations.

Sponsored 
by 
prominent 

Latino campus organizations 
and alumni, the event featured 
speakers 
who 
outlined 

inclusivity goals and stressed 
the importance of breaking 
down 
institutionalized 

borders for their on-campus 

community.

The 
Office 
of 
Academic 

Multicultural Initiatives, along 
with the Office of Multi-Ethnic 
Student Affairs, the Spectrum 
Center 
and 
the 
Alumni 

Association are collaborating 
for the second time to bring a 
month of activities, including 
keynote 
speakers, 
film 

screenings, poetry readings 
and other events that celebrate 
Latino heritage, to campus.

This 
year’s 
theme 
for 

LatinX Heritage Month is 
“Sin Fronteras,” Spanish for 
“Without Borders.” Medical 
student 
Mayra 
Gómez, 

a 
member 
of 
the 
LatinX 

Heritage Month committee, 
said artificial borders that 

When you walk through some 

University of Michigan Health 
system facilities, you might meet 
Anna and Denver, who arrived 
at UMHS this July. They work 
full days and make rounds at 
the hospital, visiting different 
medical centers and meeting new 
people.

However, the two are neither 

doctors nor patients — they’re 
new hospital dogs intended to 
provide therapeutic services and 
improve the wellbeing of patients 
and staff throughout UMHS.

Denver, 
a 
16-month-old 

Labrador-golden retriever mix, 
and Anna, an 18-month-old 
golden retriever, are trained 
service animals cared for by Joel 
Maier, Mott-certified child life 
specialist and Rev. Lindsay Bona, 
manager of the UMHS Spiritual 
Care Department.

The dogs were purchased 

to 
supplement 
the 
existing 

canine 
program 
at 
UMHS, 

through which other dogs and 
volunteers from Therapaws of 
Michigan have visited patients 
on a requested basis since 
1987. However, because those 
resources are somewhat limited 
due to a high demand, UMHS 
has been working to expand their 
canine comfort services over the 
last year.

The dogs were purchased for 

$30,000 each with a donation 
from the Laurence Polatsch 
Memorial Fund. Both Anna 

and 
Denver 
also 
received 

funding from a “puppy shower” 
fundraising campaign that was 
held when they first arrived 
to raise money for their daily 
maintenance needs, such as 
veterinary services and food.

The dogs received extensive 

training prior to starting work 
at UMHS, including more than 
a year at the Canine Assistants 
program 
and 
a 
weeklong 

orientation 
earlier 
in 
the 

summer with their caretakers. 
At training, the dogs were 
exposed to different types of 
social environments — including 
hospitals, grocery stores and 
parks — and learned basic day-
to-day behaviors. Maier said the 
goal was to teach them how to 
interact with various patients and 
behave in public transportation 
settings.

According to the pet therapy 

organization PAWS for People, 

service animals and pet therapy 
have a number of physical 
and mental health benefits for 
patients, such as lowering blood 
pressure, diminishing physical 
pain, 
decreasing 
feelings 
of 

alienation and reducing anxiety. 
They can also motivate children 
and allow them to focus more 
effectively.

For similar reasons, other local 

volunteers 
and 
organizations 

At the second feedback forum 

for LSA’s Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan Thursday night, 
which focused on how the plan 
relates to graduate students, 
some 
audience 
members 

expressed concerns about lack of 
input students had on the plan.

The 
DEI 
plan 
outlines 

prospective 
goals 
for 
LSA 

programs over a five-year period, 
including the implementation of 
a variety of programs including 
a diversity component of criteria 
for faculty raises, more funds 
for application fee waivers and 
improvements in recruitment 
processes for graduate students. 
It is part of a larger campus-wide 
effort launched by University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel last year.

The forums, which are slated 

to address concerns from a 
number of different groups in 
LSA, aim to allow student input 
in the revision process.

The 
majority 
of 
the 

audience 
members 
Thursday 

night, however, were faculty 
members. Among the students

Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, speaks at the Michigan State University Union in East Lansing Thursday. 

Chelsea Clinton, daughter of 

Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton 
and 
former 

President Bill Clinton, visited 
East Lansing Thursday night 
to advocate for her mother’s 

campaign.

Michigan 
State 
University’s 

chapter of College Democrats 
hosted Clinton in the university’s 
student union, with 200 people 
were in attendance. After speaking 
for 15 minutes at the public event, 
Clinton 
took 
questions 
from 

several attendees.

MSU junior Dan Eggerding, 

president 
of 
MSU 
College 

Democrats, said Michigan State 
was honored to host Clinton. He 
noted the important role such 
events play in mobilizing voters, 
especially at this stage in the 
campaign.

“As a student at MSU, I think 

it’s important that campaigns 
send representatives from their 

respective campaigns to get out 
the vote — especially now since 
the October registration deadline 
is approaching,” Eggerding said. 
“A huge surrogate, such as the 
daughter of the former president 
and hopeful next president, is a 
really amazing and awesome thing 
that MSU was humbled to host.”

Dr. 
Denis 
Mukwege, 
a 

world-renowned gynecologist 
and three-time Nobel Peace 
Prize 
nominee 
from 
the 

Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, spoke Thursday at the 
School of Nursing about his 
work helping women recover 
from violent forms of rape in 
his war-torn home country.

Mukwege, who established 

the 
Panzi 
Hospital 
and 

Foundations 
in 
1999, 

participated 
in 
a 
Q&A 

session with filmmaker Mike 
Ramsdell, who screened his

civil war in the Congo, titled 
“When 
Elephants 
Fight.” 

The hospital and foundation 
work to provide a full range 
of health services to women in 
the Congo.

Nursing Prof. Janis Miller, 

organizer of the event, said she 
is involved with a University 
of Michigan organization that 
is working in partnership with 
Mukwege’s

that were in the audience, 
some drew attention to the 
lack 
of 
involvement 
from 

graduate students. Social Work 
student 
Brittney 
Williams 

said the scarcity of graduate 
involvement, both tonight and 
at other times, was caused by 
the scheduling of the events.

“A lot of students have voiced 

concern that a lot of events like 
this happen at times that are 
more convenient for faculty and 
staff,” she said. “These are great, 
but I think there would be more 
participation and more student 
input if they were at times that 
are more accessible to students.”

Some attendees also raised 

concerns of what they described 
as the fragmented nature of 
the planning process, noting 
that LSA released its DEI plan 
in August, and University of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
will 
release 
the 

campus-wide plan on Oct. 6.

LSA 
Assistant 
Dean 
Liz 

Cole facilitated the event and 
presented specific portions of 
the plan that relate to Rackham 
students. 
She 
discussed 

improvements in the recruiting 
process, 
additional 
master’s 

transition bridge programs and 
partnerships 
with 
minority-

serving 
institutions, 
which 

are designed to foster a more 
diverse climate for graduates.

She also fielded criticism 

from students, saying many 
components of the plan would 
grow and change as time went 
on.

“We’ve 
had 
a 
lot 
of 

conversations 
about 

assessments for these different 
kinds of programs and we 
do think that there’s a lot 
of 
accountability 
built 
into 

the plan,” Cole said. “I can’t 
guarantee that we will succeed 
in all our goals in five years, but 
I think there’s going to be of 
course adjustments all along the 
way.”

Along 
with 
criticism, 

however, 
there 
were 
also 

multiple aspects of the plan that 
the audience members pointed 
to as positives. Economics Ph.D. 
coordinator Laura Flak said 
she 
particularly 
appreciated 

the 
planned 
implementation 

of 
seminars 
and 
tests 
for 

admissions officers on bias.

“The 
thing 
that’s 
most 

exciting for me is requiring the 

admissions chairs to attend 
these 
trainings 
on 
implicit 

bias,” she said. “Just across 
the board, from my personal 
experiences, oftentimes people 
become chairs because they’ve 
been around for a long time, 
have experience that sometimes 
comes at the expense of being 
well informed in terms of 
campus climate and education 
about implicit bias.”

She also said she appreciated 

the 
continued 
attempts 
to 

make campus a more open and 
welcoming space, such as the 
plan.

“I’m excited in the fact that 

it just helps perpetuate the 
general feeling of ecology in 
the University as a progressive 
environment, as a welcoming 
environment, 
a 
very 
open 

environment 
for 
all 
kinds 

of ideas and thoughts and 
people,” Flak said. “That just 
constantly makes me happy, this 
movement towards being more 
progressive.”

Kinesiology graduate student 

Elena Simpkins said she was 
optimistic about the plan,but 
also noted that she had some 
doubts, reflecting on both her 
graduate and undergraduate 
experiences at the University.

“We’ve witnessed pushes 

for these things before and 
still felt the same at the end,” 
she said. “I’m here because I 
have some glimmer of hope. 
But it’s still hard because 
there are times when I feel 
like things that I hear from 
the president or other people 
don’t always line up with 
actions. And it makes it hard 
sometimes to fully believe 
that what is going to happen 
in five years is going to be 
different than what we have 
now.”

Williams, 
who 
also 

attended 
the 
University 

as an undergraduate, said 
while she has experienced 
little positive change in 
campus culture, she remains 
optimistic.

“It’s really, really difficult 

when you’ve got over a 
decade 
behind 
you 
of 

observation and experience 
at the University and it still 
feels like there’s not as much 
hope as you wish there 
were,” she said. “But I do 
have hope.”

have also brought their service 
and therapy dogs to other parts 
of the University, such as Shapiro 
Undergraduate Library or the 
Diag during midterms and finals 
week.

“Dogs bring a different element 

that we as humans can’t,” Maier 
said. “When Denver walks in the 
room, as a dog he’s completely 
non-judgmental, he’s fully loving. 
… When he walks in the room, that 

family opens up. He breaks down 
walls that I can’t.”

Anna has traveled throughout 

the health system while Denver 
primarily visits patients at C.S. 
Mott Children’s Hospital, Maier 
and Bona said.

“Quite often I’ll get the response 

from parents, ‘This is the first time 
I’ve seen my child smile in a week 
or two weeks,’ ” Maier said.

He added that the dogs have 

assisted patients anxious about 
treatment, 
interacted 
with 

families staying with sick loved 
ones, provided fun and supportive 

companionship around the health 
system and kept the staff smiling 
on stressful days.

Bona said much of this success 

from having Denver and Anna 
at the hospital can be attributed 
to the relationship the dogs have 
with their owners, instilling a 
reciprocal sense of trust.

“They trust us to keep them 

safe, and therefore they’re able to 
be their best selves,” Bona said. 
“They can sense when patients 
and people and staff need them, 
and they just go up and give them 
love and affection.”

can divide us are meant to be 
challenged, an idea she hopes is 
conveyed throughout Hispanic 
Heritage Month.

“We chose the subject of ‘Sin 

Fronteras’ to emphasize that 
despite our differences, we can 
come together and celebrate,” 
she said. “So we ask you to be 
aware of the borders that exist 
and question them.”

University 
alum 
Hector 

Galván, a program coordinator 
at OAMI, said the title of the 
commemoration was changed 
two years ago from “Latin@ 
Heritage Month” in an effort 
to be more inclusive, which he 
added is central to OAMI’s goal 
of the importance of community 
at the University.

“With a growing number 

of 
Latino 
students 
at 
the 

University, it’s very important 
that they feel at home, they 
feel welcome and that they 
feel this institution recognizes 
their cultural heritage and the 
contributions that they bring,” 
he said.

According to the Office of the 

Registrar’s ethnicity reports, 
there were 2,028 self-identified 
Hispanic students during fall 
2015, making up approximately 
4.6 percent of the campus 
population. 
Galván 
said 
he 

aimed to create a welcoming 
community for these students 
coming to campus.

“A very important aspect 

of LatinX Heritage Month is 
creating a space for people 
to feel that their culture and 
their heritage is accurately 
represented 
through 
the 

University of Michigan,” he 
said.

That idea of inclusivity, he 

said, is one reason for moving 
away from the traditional names 
for this month such as “Latino 
Heritage Month” or “Hispanic 
Heritage Month,” which is how 
the celebration is commonly 
referred to across the nation. 

“We 
realized 
that 
some 

people may not fall strictly on 
one side of this gender binary,” 
he said. “So we use the term 
‘LatinX’ to be more inclusive 
of 
those 
people 
that 
fall 

somewhere along the gender 
spectrum.”

LSA junior Tania Lopez said 

she finds the term “LatinX” 
creates 
a 
stage 
of 
equal 

opportunity where all members 
of the Hispanic community can 
express ideas without feeling 
discriminated 
against 
by 
a 

gender label.

“I think it’s very important 

to have awareness of the LatinX 
community since we are so 
small, and we just need our 
voices to be heard,” she said.

Hispanic 
Heritage 
Month 

was 
originally 
created 
as 

Hispanic Heritage Week in 
1968 by then-President Lyndon 
B. Johnson. In 1988, then-
President 
Ronald 
Reagan 

expanded 
the 
observance 

to the 30-day period that it 
covers today, a time especially 

significant 
in 
the 
Latino 

community due to the many 
Latin American countries that 
celebrate their independence 
during this month.

University 
alum 
Israel 

Diego said he feels there is a 
connection 
across 
members 

of the Latino community that 
transcends 
other 
cultural 

differences.

“I like the idea that we are 

all Hispanic, as in Spanish-
speaking,” he said. “So it’s 
really good to be able to have 
that solidarity between us and I 
highly respect that.”

Gómez said she finds the 

Latino community on campus 
a safe place to share her 
experiences.

“For me, it was a little 

alienating to be in the Med 
School where it’s a very elite and 
privileged group,” she said. “A 
lot of my classmates come from 
a lineage of doctors. My mom 
has a fourth-grade education 
and my dad has a sixth-grade 
education, so just being able 
to connect with people with a 
similar background with similar 
situations is very comforting.”

Diego also emphasized the 

importance of building a strong 
community 
among 
Latino 

students at the University.

“I just want other Latinos that 

still haven’t reached out to reach 
out and to really get to meet all 
the other members of the Latino 
community still in the school,” 
he said. “It’s really important to 
engage and to become a stronger 
people in the University.”

Clinton spoke about a variety of 

topics during the event Thursday, 
with a focus on the value of every 
vote in this election. She called on 
MSU students to encourage their 
friends to register to vote and 
plan on making it to the polls on 
Election Day.

“This election is relevant to 

everybody,” Clinton said. “Talk 
to your friends about college 
affordability. This election is 
relevant to all of us.”

Discussing 
the 
current 

landscape of higher education, 
she highlighted her mother’s New 
College Compact — a plan aimed 
at restructuring current student 
debt and establishing tuition-free 
public universities and colleges 
— saying it could reshape student 
debt in the United States.

Throughout the night, Clinton 

also 
emphasized 
contrasts 

between Hillary Clinton and 
her rival, Republican nominee 
Donald Trump. After an attendee 
asked a question regarding the 
current Syrian refugee crisis and 
global climate of Islamophobia, 
she 
highlighted 
Trump’s 

“normalization of hate speech” 
and her mother’s commitment to 
her campaign slogan, “stronger 
together.”

With that slogan hung behind 

her, Clinton charged that her 
mother’s campaign focuses on 
bringing people together, while 

Trump’s 
focuses 
on 

divisiveness.

“We have a lot more work 

to do to keep the progress that 
has been made and continue the 
work that still has to be done,” 
Clinton said. “The president can 
lead but she can’t do it alone. … 
(Hillary Clinton is the) only one 
person running for president who 
believes that the ‘we’ includes all 
of us.”

Taiwo 
Dosunmu, 

communications director of the 
University of Michigan’s chapter 
of College Democrats, wrote in 
an e-mail interview that Clinton’s 
visit to MSU, like Tim Kaine’s 
recent stop at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
signifies 
the 

importance of the student vote.

“In 
the 
past, 
Democrats 

have done well in Michigan 
presidential contests, but as Tim 
Kaine alluded to at his rally here 
on campus, victory in Michigan 
— or anywhere — cannot be taken 
for granted,” Dosunmu wrote. 
“Students 
and 
young 
voters 

across the state have a great deal 
of power in this election and we 
must take responsibility for our 
future.”

Along with Chelsea Clinton 

and Tim Kaine, many other 
supporters of Hillary Clinton, 
as well as the candidate herself, 
have been frequent visitors to 
the state. Trump has also had a 
noticeable presence in Michigan, 
visiting the state most recently 
during a Sept. 14 visit to Flint.

Trump’s campaign has said 

several times they plan to take 

Michigan in the election, though 
the state has not been won by 
a GOP nominee since Ronald 
Reagan.

A recent Detroit Free Press/

WXYZ-TV poll found Trump to 
be closing in on Clinton’s lead. 
The poll projected 38 percent 
of the vote for Clinton and 35 
percent to Trump — the rest 
of the respondents, 13 percent, 
were 
either 
still 
undecided, 

backing Libertarian candidate 
Gary Johnson or Green Party 
candidate Jill Stein.

This is consistent with national 

polling throughout the campaign, 
showing 
a 
statistically 
close 

race with the two candidates 
frequently within a few points 
of one another. The most recent 
polling, from an NBC News/Wall 
Street Journal survey, found that 
Clinton leads Trump nationally 
by six points among likely voters.

In a statement in response to 

Clinton’s event, Scott Hagerstrom, 
the Trump campaign’s Michigan 
state director, charged that her 
campaign wasn’t right for the 
state.

“After Hillary let slip at a 

Wall Street fundraiser earlier 
this month that she sees half of 
this country’s voters — including 
veterans, 
police 
officers, 

firefighters 
and 
other 
hard 

working Americans — as either 
‘deplorable’ 
or 
‘irredeemable,’ 

Michiganders have one question 
for Chelsea Clinton on her 
visit here — does she agree 
with Hillary’s view of them?” 
Hagerstrom said.

about the newly established 
International 
Center 
of 

Advanced 
Research 
and 

Training, 
which 
seeks 
to 

improve health education for 
aid workers in the region.

“Tonight we are going to 

honor Dr. Denis Mukwege, 
who has both figuratively and 
literally stitched women who 
have been victims of violence 
back together,” Miller said.

Miller also noted that the 

University 
has 
developed 

a special relationship with 
Mukwege, in part through 
his son, Dr. Alain Mukwege, 
who was a visiting scholar 
on campus. In 2010, Denis 
Mukwege received the UM 
Raoul 
Wallenberg 
Medal, 

which is an annual award for 
work done by humanitarians 
around the world.

“When Dr. Mukwege first 

came to Ann Arbor in 2010 to 
receive his Raoul Wallenberg 
Medal, he took up the rallying 
cry of that famous University of 
Michigan alum (Wallenberg) 
— that even one person can 
make a difference.” Miller said 
to the crowd.

Following 
Mukwege’s 

introduction, Ramsdell spoke 
about his experiences in the 
Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and his inspiration for 
creating his documentary.

“I believe that if a film — 

the most powerful media that 
I can think of — can elicit 
an emotional response and 
inspire a deeper intellectual 
understanding of a topic, then 
99 percent of the time, we can 
get people to work to help their 
fellow man,” Ramsdell said.

Ramsdell 
also 
told 
the 

audience about the personal 
significance and impact of 
his time in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo.

“Once you go to the Congo, 

you can’t un-Congo yourself 
— it becomes a part of you,” 
Ramsdell said. “The Congo is 
powerful, impactful, painful 
and beautiful. … But what you 
see, you cannot un-see. I have 
daughters, I have a mom, I have 
a girlfriend, I have sisters. So I 
made a movie to expose what 
is happening to this special 
place.”

Following the screening of 

the 50-minute documentary, 
which gave a history of the 
nation and of the protracted 
civil war that is, in part, over 
lucrative 
mineral 
rights, 

Ramsdell 
and 
Mukwege 

participated 
in 
the 
Q&A 

session.

Mukwege 
began 
by 

reflecting on his early career 
as a doctor in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. He 
told the audience that he 
arrived there after receiving 
medical training in France 
as a pediatrician, but once he 
saw how many women died 
giving birth each day, he went 
back to France to become a 
gynecologist. 

“After my second training 

in France, I returned home 
and set up a hospital and a 
midwifery school,” Mukwege 
said. “But then in 1996, the 
war came to my hospital. It 
was invaded, and they killed 
my patients. I couldn’t bear 
to return to the hospital for 
another two years.”

Mukwege, 
who 
has 

developed 
an 
international 

reputation as a surgeon who 
specializes in reconstructive 
surgery 
for 
victims 
of 

violent rape, said he based 

his 
treatment 
off 
a 
four-

pillar program that focuses 
holistically on patients’ overall 
health.

The four pillars are physical 

treatment, 
then 
mental 

health counseling, economic 
reintegration and providing 
the patient with legal services.

Ramsdell 
stressed 
the 

importance 
of 
Mukwege’s 

work as an advocate for victims 
of brutal war crimes, and also 
highlighted how Americans 
can help.

“It all is tied to business 

interests,” Ramsdell said. “The 
minerals that are at the heart 
of the conflict — these are 
components that go into all 
of our electronics that power 
our lives. If everyone were 
to boycott firms that engage 
in shady business deals for 
mineral rights in the Congo, 
then these business practices 
would absolutely change.”

Nursing sophomore Olivia 

Hamilton said she knew very 
little about the conflict in the 
Democratic Republic of the 
Congo before Thursday night’s 
event. 
She 
said 
Mukwege 

and Ramsdell’s impassioned 
call to action inspired her to 
look further into Mukwege’s 
organization.

“I was really impressed 

by 
Mukwege’s 
dedication 

to 
the 
full 
treatment 
of 

women, physical and mental,” 
Hamilton said in an interview. 
“I never really considered it 
before tonight, but, to many, 
access to this kind of health 
care is a first-world luxury that 
is not available to everyone. … I 
can’t wait to tell more people 
about this. I was really shocked 
to learn about this and even 
more surprised that this isn’t 
common knowledge here.”

FROM THE DAILY

Create a student regent

This request is not a new one. 

Over the years, CSG candidates’ 
platforms 
have 
stressed 
the 

importance of increasing student 
involvement in the higher-up 
workings 
of 
the 
University. 

Both 
former 
CSG 
President 

Cooper Charlton and current 
CSG President David Schafer 
advocate for the board’s bylaws 
to include a student regent. The 
board’s primary responsibility is 
to supervise the University and 
control expenditures from the 
University’s funds, meaning their 
decisions directly impact students. 

This request is also not an 

outlandish 
idea: 
70 
percent 

of public universities in the 
United States have a student in 
such a position. The University 
of 
Wisconsin, 
University 
of 

Washington, 
University 
of 

Maryland 
and 
University 
of 

California system all have a student 
regent. Universities nationwide 
recognize 
the 
importance 
of 

having a student perspective not 
only in board meetings, but also in 
regent decisions, as the outcomes 
do have tangible impacts on 
students. At the University, for 
example, the board votes every 
year on the upcoming academic 
calendars. For fall semester 2015, 
the board voted to have the last 
exams two days before Christmas, 
leading students to petition to 
change the calendar. Though the 
calendars are set in advance, a 
student on the board could have 
provided input on the ways in 
which ending fall semester so late 
does a disservice to students (and 
even faculty members). Other 
important 
decisions 
directly 

affecting students that are left 
to the board’s authority include 
approving the University’s annual 
budget, approving construction 
projects and determining yearly 
tuition rates.

While it is true that our student-

elected CSG president has the 
opportunity to speak and present 
at the board’s meetings, the alloted 
speaking time is just five minutes. 
A student on the board would have 
the ability to discuss issues with 
regents for an extended period 

of time and be involved in the 
decision-making process. Though 
the board meetings include a small 
discussion before voting on an 
issue, oftentimes both discussions 
and decisions have been made 
prior to the meeting. In July 
2014, the Detroit Free Press sued 
the University over violations of 
the Open Meetings Act based on 
how the regents conducted their 
monthly meetings. The lawsuit 
held that based on the Free Press’ 
year-long analysis, the regents 
routinely make decisions about 
the 
University’s 
governance 

behind closed doors, without 
public 
accountability. 
Having 

a student regent would ensure 
students are directly involved in 
these discussions and decision-
making both prior to and at the 
board meetings.

Additionally, 
unlike 
CSG 

executives, 
who 
have 
many 

other 
duties 
that 
are 
more 

related to everyday student life, 
a student regent would be able 
to dedicate their time entirely 
to becoming an expert regent. 
Though sometimes issues regents 
vote upon are similar to CSG 
initiatives, we feel decisions made 
at the regent level are specifically 
different 
from 
CSG’s 
work: 

appropriating funds, approving 
building renovation plans and 
authorizing 
transactional 

partnerships, to name a few. A 
student regent would be able to 
dedicate his or her time entirely 
to researching, discussing and 
proposing solutions to the types of 
issues that fall under the board’s 
responsibility. 
Furthermore, 

opponents to adding a nonvoting 
student member to the board 
argue that a student could not 
possibly have the expertise to hold 
such a position. But there are many 
other high-level positions filled by 
students at this University, such 
as CSG president, athletic team 
captains, presidents of nationwide 
student organizations, the editor 
in chief of The Michigan Daily and 
countless others that are arguably 
also very difficult positions.

It’s important to note that 

adding even a nonvoting student 

member to the board challenge 
Article VIII, Section 5 of the 
Michigan 
state 
constitution. 

The constitution states, “The 
board of each institution shall 
consist of eight members who 
shall hold office for terms of eight 
years and who shall be elected 
as provided by law,” and only 
mentions one nonvoting member 
— the university president. It does 
not, however, specify whether 
the president can be the only 
nonvoting member. Having more 
than one nonvoting member on 
the board is not addressed in the 
constitution, so adding a student to 
the board seems neither explicitly 
legal nor illegal. Though if the 
process moves forward, this issue 
will have to be resolved. Even so, 
changing the constitution is not 
out of reach, as amendments and 
referendums are not infrequent 
in Michigan.

This 
being 
said, 
we 

acknowledge it may be very 
difficult to achieve this goal, 
given that a change to the 
Michigan 
Constitution 
may 

be necessary. We advocate 
to the highest degree for this 
constitutional change; however, 
if implementing a student regent 
is not feasible, it is still vital that 
student input within the board’s 
decisions is increased. Firstly, 
creating a group of students 
who are dedicated to discussing 
regent-related 
issues 
and 

allowing representatives from 
that group time before and during 
the board meetings to voice 
their concerns would increase 
student 
input. 
Secondly, 

scheduling regular meetings 
between the board and student 
groups would also increase 
students’ abilities to participate 
and have a voice in issues.

So while we applaud the steps 

the board took by adding back in 
the bylaw that states they will 
consider more student input, 
much more concrete action 
needs to be taken. Implementing 
a nonvoting student regent and 
creating more places for students 
to have clear dialogue with regents 
are important next steps to take.

T

hough 
Dr. 
Denis 

Mukwege 
was 
here 

at the University of 

Michigan just yesterday, he 
won’t be staying long. He has 
to get back to Panzi Hospital, a 
tall, tan stucco building in the 
eastern hills of the Democratic 
Republic 
of 
Congo. 
There, 

he will treat rape victims — 
women 
and 
children 
who 

come to the hospital following 
attacks by militia groups that 
roam the DRC. Mukwege has 
been working in the region for 
many years. When he returns 
from this latest trip to the 
United States, he may treat 
not only new women who have 
been attacked, but also women 
coming back after a second 
or third rape. Sometimes he 
treats the children of women he 
helped years before.

For attendees at Mukwege’s 

talk yesterday, this was a rare 
opportunity to meet a key 
human rights leader. Mukwege 
has received countless awards, 
including 
our 
own 
Raoul 

Wallenberg Medal in 2010 and a 
nomination for the Nobel Peace 
Prize in 2013. The New York 
Times called him a “steadying 
presence among the turmoil” of 
his region.

All too often, these events on 

campus with such influential 
people are used as a “get out of 
jail free card” when it comes 
to addressing human rights: 
Invite 
a 
few 
humanitarian 

heroes, applaud loudly, get a 
selfie, go home. What starts 
as an earnest resolution to do 
better and be inspired ends 
in a self-congratulatory pat 
on the back of the University 
community. For us to feel 
worthy of handing out human 
rights awards and looking up 
to true humanitarians like 
Mukwege, a closer look at our 
own humanitarian record, and 
ongoing complicity in abuses 
around the world, is crucial.

It’s far too easy for us to feel 

both guiltless and powerless 
in conflicts far from our leafy 
campus. But the fact of the 

matter is, as remote, exotic and 
inhumane as events in the DRC 
seem to us, our lives are bound 
to theirs by a thin, fragile slice 
of metal: our electronics, which 
are drenched with Congolese 
blood and heaped with U.S. 
dollars. When I examine my own 
life, a series of strange parallels 
illustrates our complicity. It’s all 
in the numbers.

On May 1, 1996, I am born; 

I drool and sleep a lot. In the 
DRC, the first Congo War 
starts. U.S. forces and other 
Western governments installed 
a dictator decades before, then 
let him fall when they no longer 

needed him. In his place came 
a new leader, an assassination 
and chaos. And something new 
— mass rape as an explicit tool 
of war.

On May 1, 2008, I receive 

my first cell phone for my 12th 
birthday; it has a tiny screen 
and can send and receive 
texts (that’s about all it can 
do). 
It 
contains 
tantalum, 

tungsten and other minerals 
found in the DRC. Companies 
like AngloGold Ashanti and 
Century 
make 
deals 
with 

violent, abusive militia groups 
and receive highly favorable 
mining concessions in return 
for hard cash. 

And then there are numbers, 

larger 
and 
darker: 
50,000 

victims treated at Mukwege’s 
hospital. 
Five 
hundred 

thousand women raped since 
the Congolese conflict began, 
according to Human Rights 
Watch. According to Mukwege, 
five million Congolese were 
killed by Belgium during its 
colonial expansion in the 1800s 
— half the country’s population.

We cannot rely on our own 

government to address these 
problems. That’s what we’ve 
been doing in the past, and it 
hasn’t worked. So many of the 
tenets of “American values,” 
enshrined in the Declaration 
of Independence, have been 
thrown out the window when 
American money was at stake. 
This is not a hot topic issue, a 
flash in the American pan. Our 
connection to these resources 
makes 
us 
responsible, 
as 

consumers and as citizens, for 
this violation of core American 
beliefs.

There is something we can 

do. Mining companies’ deals 
are currently as opaque as a 
pile of shale, that being, they 
are most definitely not. But they 
could be transparent, which 
would mean they would not 
be able to make concessions or 
deals with warlords and rebel 
militias. They’d have to pay a 
living wage to their workers in 
the DRC. They’d have to pay a 
fair amount for the privilege of 
getting stinking rich — putting 
money into Congolese education, 
hospitals like Dr. Mukwege’s, 
power lines and roads in the areas 
they are currently exploiting. 
We, as American citizens, buying 
these 
companies’ 
products, 

would know whether the people 
who built our high-speed, high-
tech world were doing the same 
in Central Africa, or simply 
breaking the countries down for 
parts that we deem valuable.

Your voice may seem small, 

but the University’s isn’t. Speak 
up, and someone just might 
listen. Problems do not become 
intractable until they are met 
with apathy. Do not let the work 
of true humanitarians like Dr. 
Mukwege become compromised 
by our inaction.

L

ast Thursday, the University of Michigan Board of Regents voted to 
reinstate a bylaw that encourages student participation in University 
decision-making removed in 2011. Both former and current Central 

Student Government presidents have also made efforts since March to 
allow for more student input during board meetings. While reinstating the 
bylaw is a good step forward — it clearly communicates to students that 
the board values student input — the University ultimately needs to make 
more concrete changes to incorporate student voice. To effectively achieve 
this goal, the regents should amend their bylaws and create a position for a 
nonvoting student member on the board.

FOR RENT

In “Amazing or Malaising,” 

Daily Arts Writer Harry Krinsky 
decides if a piece of culture is won-
derful or trapped in malaise.

Apple Music and Spotify have 

a bunch of problems, but it’s easy 
to overlook them because only 10 
years ago the music industry was 
hemorrhaging from an epidemic 
of illegal mp3 downloading.

For example: one of the tabs 

in the Apple Music app is called 
“For You.” The tab features a 
constantly updated list of playl-
ists that Apple Music thinks you 
will like based on the music you 
already listen to. Spotify has a 
similar feature. They are both 
effectively useless.

Here are the playlists Apple 

Music has curated for me and 
stored in the “For You” section of 
the app.

1) 
 I Aint Saying She a 

Gold Digger…

2) 
Meek Mill vs. Drake

3) Inspired By Lauryn Hill
4) Gucci Mane Essentials
5) Hipster’s Paradise, Vol 1. 

(Which features hip underground 
artists like Kanye West, Tyler the 
Creator, Lupe Fiasco and Frank 
Ocean.)

I have basically never used 

the Apple Music “For You” sec-
tion. The only two playlists I have 
found remotely useful have been 
“Lil Wayne Guest List 2000-
2010” and “Drake’s Pop Culture 
Lexicon.” The main problem 
with these computer generated 
playlists, is that they have the dis-
tinct feel of something made by a 
computer. They are not mixtapes 
your significant other made you, 
or even the “Summer Pregame 
2015” playlist your roommate 
whipped you up. They are the 
product of algorithms. I recently 
listened to Gucci Mane’s new 
album, so they hit me with the 
“Gucci Essentials,” I listened to 
Erika Badu the other day. Lau-
ryn Hill. Possibly they know I 
just moved into an Airbnb in 
Williamsburg, “Hipster’s Para-
dise Vol 1.” The point is that the 
playlists are entirely predictable. 
It is so clear that an algorithm 
sucked up my listening data, and 
spit out some set of lame playlists 
that I will likely disregard unless 
they have the words “Drake” and 
“Lexicon” in them.

The “For You” tab is corny and 

robotic. It’s easy to see where 
technology came in and pushed 
the amorphous “soul” of music 
discovery out. For some reason, 
though, we don’t look at the tab 
to the left, the “New” tab, in the 
same light. While “For You” 

features 
pseudo-personalized 

recommendations that we see 
through immediately, the “New” 
tab helps users find music that’s 
not just new to them, but new 
to existence. I think the normal 
reaction to finding out there is 
tab that helps you find new music 
is probably somewhere between 
excitement and ambivalence, but 
the truth is, this feature is some-
thing every fan of creative, non-
homogenous music should be 
afraid of.

Today, music discovery is so 

accessible that it’s a legitimate 
millennial hobby. Like, I spend 
between 30 minutes and two 
hours a day scouring blogs for 
new tracks by new artists. This 
hobby is so ubiquitous that find-
ing new songs comes with its own 
sort of social capital. Every friend 
group has the friend who “always 
finds music before it blows up.” 
 

There are entire websites devot-
ed to supplying readers with 
new music. I think the music 
blog sphere, while at times over-
whelming, is certifiably amazing. 
We are in the golden age of music 
discovery. There are a seemingly 
infinite amount of tracks scat-
tered across the internet, with 
no barriers to entry other than 
access to a computer and time. 
There is an entire ecosystem of 
blogs with different tastes they 
cater too. There are blogs that 
post every 20 minutes, sharing 
strange interviews or obscure 
shitty mixtapes. Then there are 
blogs like Hypetrak that post less 
frequently, filter out a little of 
the garbage, but are often steps 
behind those high output blogs. 
Then there are websites like 
The Fader or Complex, whose 
posts are more often a validation 
of fame than a stepping stone 
towards it. Yeah, it can take two 
hours of scouring the internet 
before finding a mildly likable 
track, but that’s the point.

(Maybe you can see where I’m 

going with this. I’m 21 and I’m 
already lamenting the loss of a 
simpler time. But when culture 
and technology move so fast, it’s 
a lot easier to get nostalgic.)

The first problem with Apple 

Music’s discovery platform, is 
it distills the blog scouring pro-
cess into something anyone can 
do. More importantly, it distills 
the blog scouring process into 
something anyone can do in five 
minutes. There are playlists like 
“Apple A-List Hip Hop” or Spoti-
fy’s “Rap Caviar” that search the 
internet for trending songs, and 
spit out the top 15 most trending 
songs. Those playlists are then 
presented to the user in order 

of popularity. In other words, it 
tracks the popular “about to be 
popular” songs.

Yeah, I’m salty that Apple 

Music has made my literacy with 
the music blog-sphere a nearly 
useless quality, but that isn’t why 
these playlists bum me out so 
much.

Right now these playlists track 

and identify hype. They notice 
what is trending and synthesize 
it. The same robots who made the 
laughable “For You” tab make the 
unfortunately legitimate “New” 
tab. Though, the true reason to 
worry about these playlists goes 
beyond the inauthentic distilla-
tion of hype. We should worry 
because the logical next step 
for these behemoth distribution 
platforms is for them to manufac-
ture hype, not just track it.

It’s important to note that the 

tab in the center of the Apple 
Music’s app is the “radio” tab. 
Similarly, it’s important to note 
that the only Spotify advertise-
ment I ever hear is for their week-
ly discovery playlist. The internet 
is slowly but surely killing radio, 
so why did Apple Music invest 
millions in deals with Drake, 
Zane Lowe and Dr. Dre to pro-
duce radio shows? When Spotify 
was first explained to me, it was 
pitched as Pandora but with the 
ability to choose your own songs. 
So why is Spotify pushing a fea-
ture that chooses the songs for 
you? Why is radio back from the 
dead, resurrected by the technol-
ogy that killed it?

The Answer, I think, is that 

the next frontier of these big 
companies is to control exactly 
what we discover. In corner-
ing the music discovery space, 
Apple and Spotify are effec-
tively mass producing trendi-
ness. They are Urban Outfitters 
for your ears. Most music fans 
roll their eyes at mega popular 
songs because they often feel 
like they were manufactured 
for radio, but openly embrace 
songs that haven’t yet become 
popular, even if they are des-
tined to do so. It used to be that 
the underground or the yet to be 
discovered artists were the ones 
pushing the envelope of music. 
I think this is still true, but can 
anything that can be found on 
the front page of Apple Music’s 
mobile app really be described 
as underground?

You would never think any of 

the “For You” playlists are actual-
ly for you. Why would you think 
anything in the “New” category 
is actually anything new?

The future of ‘For You’

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Each night this past summer 

ended with the same routine: 
me, my friends, Crosby the dog, 
a couple bags of Tostitos “Hint 
of Lime” chips, tropical mix Hi-
Chews and banana bread (if it 
was a good night) all adorned by 
some nice citronella candles in 
my buddy Matt’s quintessential-
ly Midwestern back yard.

Music played, too.
Often you hear people talk 

about their summer “song” or 
“anthem” or “jam.” Each of those 
terms are fairly clichéd, but 
that’s irrelevant. What’s more 
important is that, for any type of 
music to become at all emblem-
atic of any amount of time, it 
needs to seep in organically. It 
should be there as you’re there — 
unforced and unprompted.

That’s just what happened 

with Whitney’s Light Upon the 
Lake. I don’t remember exactly 
when it started playing or how 
it was suggested. On the third, 
maybe fourth night in the back-
yard, however, someone had to 
notice. It’s good stuff. Julien 
Ehrlich’s voice is weepy, sensi-
tive and unlike anything we had 
ever heard. Former Smith West-
erns guitarist Max Kakacek’s 
gentle touch is quite complemen-
tary.

It’s not easy to quantify music. 

In fact, it’s more unnecessary and 
damaging to the experience than 
it is productive. That being said, 

looking back on it, each night 
now seems numbered, compart-
mentalized to its own tracklist. 
The first night we went to the 
backyard? That was definitely a 
Light Upon the Lake night. The 
night we sent our Elder friend 
off on his two year Mormon mis-
sion? “Golden Days” worked. 
Undoubtedly the best way to get 
a grip on what was happening 
was to embrace the soundtrack 
behind it. Whitney simply made 
too much sense for us to ignore.

On “The Falls,” for example, 

Ehrlich sounds confused, admit-
ting, “Cause I’m not too sure I 
know / Which way the rising 
river flows / On the night I lose 
control / Oh dear, don’t you let 
me go,” stirring in all of us a dan-
gerous cauldron of college-aged 
fear and anxiety. He also simul-
taneously highlights his own 
understanding of our need for 
togetherness — in that defining 
moment (whatever and whenev-
er it is), in the uncertainty lead-
ing up to that moment and in the 
aftermath.

Maybe it’s that sort of wisdom 

that makes me giggle a little bit 
and even shed a tear whenever 
I talk about Whitney’s influence 
on our summer, until I real-
ize that I’m acting like every-
body’s grandfather. But that’s 
a really good thing; it speaks 
to the enduring quality of the 
album. However great our sum-
mer was, the ten tracks on Light 
Upon the Lake enhanced it on 

another level, and they followed 
us everywhere, in the best type 
of way.

Whether it was the delicate 

jam of “Dave’s Song” (“And I 
know how to keep you hung 
up but I won’t do it again / Oh 
I know I wish you were my 
friend”) or the adventure that is 
“No Matter Where We Go” (“I 
can take you out / I wanna drive 
around / With you with the win-
dows down / And we can run all 
night”), there was a mood for 
everything.

We heard it after coming home 

from a Fourth of July party, dur-
ing which we saw “acquain-
tances” from high school who 
we definitely had no desire to see 
again.

We heard it while camping at 

Devil’s Lake State Park in Wis-
consin.

We most definitely heard it at 

Pitchfork Music Festival, where 
they played 20 feet in front of us.

And most importantly, we 

heard it at Matt’s house with 
the chips and Hi-Chews and dog 
and, most importantly, us.

I hope to hear Light Upon the 

Lake for a while even after this 
year. I’ve been listening as I walk 
around campus, but it isn’t quite 
the same. Whitney preached that 
“When it’s coming to an end, at 
least the rain won’t come again,” 
and it sure seems like something 
came to an end. I guess I’m just 
hoping something hits me again. 
I’d even take rain.

My summer of ‘Light Upon the Lake’

Following a brief period of 

namelessness, the four-piece 
post-punk outfit hailing from 
Calgary, 
Alberta 

have 
returned 

with a glossier, 
more 
accessible 

sound. Originally 
known 
as 
Viet 

Cong, the band 
elected to change 
their name fol-
lowing 
protests 

and at least two canceled book-
ings — both of which were in 
response to accusations of cul-
tural appropriation, racism and 
glorification of the Vietnamese 
guerilla army. Playing shows as 
“Matt, Mike, Scott, and Daniel” 
(their first names) for several 
months, they settled on Preoc-
cupations after a friend wrote 
them a list of name suggestions. 
Returning now with their sec-
ond eponymous release, Preoc-
cupations debuts a tighter, more 
organized and vocally-centered 
sound that’s less fixated on 
being loud than it is on dupli-
cating the same uneasiness that 
permeated their 2015 self-titled 
release as Viet Cong.

Opening with leading single 

“Anxiety,” Preoccupations does 
just that. With an ambient, 
creepy introduction just over 
one minute in duration, drums 
and guitar break the silence 
suddenly and forcefully. Fol-
lowing shortly is vocalist/bass-
ist Matt Flegel’s grating growl, 
an instrument just as central to 
the Preoccupations sound as the 
jangly, hollow guitars that hang 
over the percussive musings of 
drummer Mike Wallace. Tied 
together by a simple, melodic 
synth line that frequents the 
remaining three minutes of 
the track, “Anxiety” is a call to 
arms, and its most readily quot-
able lyric is a reminder of the 
urgency of life: “I’m not here 
purely for the sake / Of breath-
ing, I am wide awake.”

No single track matches the 

guitar 
line 
in 
“Continental 

Shelf,” and the “Silhouettes” 
bass line is still without equal, 
but there are flourishes of 
intense accessibility sprinkled 
throughout the album. It’s hard 

to disagree with 
the 
aforemen-

tioned synth line 
of “Anxiety,” and 
for the first ten 
seconds of “Stim-
ulation,” 
Preoc-

cupations 
does 

an 
impeccable 

impression of The 

Strokes (after which a discor-
dant guitar puts an abrupt end 
to the façade). It’s difficult to 
argue that any song off of Viet 
Cong aside from “Silhouettes” 
or “Continental Shelf” ever 
had a sliver of hope for main-
stream success. Almost all of 
them threaten to scare away 
less open-minded listeners with 
prolonged, droning builds — 
see the first three minutes of 
“March of Progress” — or brow-
beating percussion (or both). 
On Preoccupations, however, 
the band seem to have acknowl-
edged (or at least subconscious-
ly realized) this risk, and while 
songs like “Monotony” and 
“Zodiac” aren’t likely to draw 
listeners in, neither should they 
turn anyone away.

More than just being accessi-

ble, some moments — especially 
“Fever” and the four-minute 
mark of “Memory” — explic-
itly recall new wave. A third 
of the way through “Memo-
ry,” the band emerges from an 
impatient percussion line in 
a moment positively reminis-
cent of New Order. Propulsive 
yet subtle bass and synthesizer 
build into Dan Boeckner’s fea-
ture (the sole feature on the 
album). With his nostalgic, 
Bowie-esque voice, Boeckner 
strengthens this New Wave 
impression and provides an 
intriguing (and welcome) con-
trast to Flegel’s generally harsh 
vocals. Though it’s tempting to 
try to equate “Memory” to Viet 
Cong’s “Death” – both function 

as anchors for their respec-
tive albums, each clocking in 
at just over 11 minutes long – 
“Memory” is pared down, less 
frantic and more ambient. It’s 
a good summation of the album 
as a whole. Where “Death” 
rails listeners with relentless 
pounding and wall-of-sound 
jamming, “Memory” spends its 
last four minutes fading slowly 
into nothingness, as memories 
themselves tend to do.

Following “Memory” is the 

second 
single, 
“Degraded,” 

in 
which 
synthesizers 
are 

unabashedly front and center 
and Flegel, in a rare (and brief) 
moment of indulgence, sings 
about relationship woes: “Won-
dering how long it might take 
to leave you / I can’t improve.” 
“Degraded” is certainly a sty-
listic exploration, but the final 
quarter of the album is where 
things get interesting. “Sense” 
is uneasy but pleasantly ambi-
ent, with Flegel trading his 
typical growl for a falsetto, 
and segues directly into its 
other half, the low-key “Forbid-
den,” whose final seconds are 
intriguing but wholly unsatis-
fying. The album is closed out 
by guitar-heavy “Stimulation,” 
during which Flegel observes 
that “We’re all gonna die,” and 
“Fever,” a pulsing, powerfully 
repetitive outro on which the 
synthesizer, in tandem with 
Flegel’s 
voice, 
takes 
center 

stage.

Whether or not there was 

actually speculation that their 
“identity crisis” would have any 
effect on their ability to put out 
quality material, their official 
return should dispel any wor-
ries that listeners may have had. 
Though some may be displeased 
with the general departure 
from the unforgiving intensity 
of Viet Cong, Preoccupations is 
an album by the same band as 
the former, minus their more 
violent tendencies. Whether or 
not it is an indication of matu-
rity is unclear and irrelevant; 
the band is back and they know 
who they are.

ALBUM REVIEW


6A — Friday, September 23, 2016
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The fact that Mac Miller is as 

relevant as he is, and command-
ing the specific type of rap cul-
tural relevance that 
he does, is some-
where 
between 

a small and large 
miracle. Early Mac 
sucked 
(though 

as a 15-year-old, 
I 
secretly 
loved 

him). He was more 
of 
a 
radioactive 

byproduct of the internet’s effect 
on rap music than a notable con-
tributor to its sound. He was 
what old people at Rock the Bells 
would complain about. In the six 
years between when Mac’s stand-
out pop-rap mixtape K.I.D.S hit 
datpiff and today, Mac has had 
seven Billboard Hot 100 tracks, 
become completely addicted and 
un-addicted 
to 
promethazine, 

produced an entire Vince Staples 
mixtape under the stage name 
Larry Fisherman, infiltrated the 
inner circles of both Odd Future 
and TDE, slept on Rick Rubin’s 
couch, moved to DUMBO (lol) and 
released two critically acclaimed 
albums (Watching Movies with the 
Sound Off and GO:OD AM).

Part of the appeal of new Mac 

Miller is that he has made mis-
takes, and he owns them. Inten-
tionally or not, new Mac plays up 
his personal and sonic growth 
with introspective lyrics and cre-
ative production, and it’s really 
good. Old Mac crooned over sim-
ple synthy choruses and talked 
about smoking weed at pool par-
ties. New Mac is warier, weirder 
and a lot cooler.

The Divine Feminine, with its 

captivating title, should have 

been good. Described as a con-
cept album, The Divine Feminine is 
supposed to be about the journey 
that is falling in love. The phrase 
“Divine Feminine,” is a nod to the 

spiritual 
concept 

of a female ener-
gy governing the 
world or, as Miller 
paraphrases, “you 
know, like, Mother 
Nature” (Red Flag).

TDF does just 

about 
everything 

to perpetuate Mac’s 

“I’ve Changed” narrative. The 
album art is minimalist, mostly 
pink and gives off the aura of pro-
fundity. The lead single off the 
album, “Dang!,” has Anderson 
Paak on it and is blowing up as I 
type this review. From top to bot-
tom the album is packed with in 
vogue features, expensive produc-
tion, and trumpet tracks record-
ed by Julliard students. I mean, 
come on, it’s a concept rap album 
ostensibly about the worshiping 
of female energy, it’s nearly satiri-
cally progressive.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t take 

more than 15 minutes into The 
Divine Feminine to realize that 
Mac does not deliver on many of 
the album’s promises. There is 
very little worshiping of female 
energy in The Divine Feminine. 
There is much talk about Miller’s 
lust over the various women in his 
life, and the problems he has with 
them, but no divinity conveyed. In 
other words: It’s a lot of Mac Mill-
er talking about the girls he has 
sex with, and that is a gentle way 
to put it.

Miller’s lyrics are unambigu-

ously misogynistic. He raps “Okay 
your legs like a store they open up. 
And you got people in the aisle” 

and later adds “First prize, Nobel, 
get a piece. Your clothes off, turn 
around, let me see. (In between 
Miller’s verse’s Ty Dolla $ign adds 
Aaron Carter-esque nuggets like 
“Parents they just don’t under-
stand.”)

For a second, if we forget about 

the insincere and misleading 
title and concept, the album does 
sound good. The production fuses 
lighthearted funk, complex jazz, 
and Miller’s darker and poignant 
rap. The tracks change abruptly, 
and each song melts into the next. 
“Dang!” is an absolute hit, with 
an energy you can’t quite wrap 
your brain around. The song is 
complicated, maybe, by the fact 
that Paak originally wrote the 
song in response to the death of a 
loved one. There are also flashes 
of not divinity, but at least relat-
able, semi-profound lyrics. On 
“Congratulations,” Miller paints 
a heartbreaking image, rapping 
about changing relationships, sex 
and love lost, before hopping right 
into “Dang!” and giving a slightly 
different, 
though 
thematically 

linked perspective.

The Divine Feminine is a well-

produced album, with an exciting 
progressive concept, and a frus-
trating lack of integrity. I do not 
mean to take on the lack of certain 
progressive ideals in rap as a whole 
— that is an entirely different dis-
cussion — but the false promise 
of progressiveness in The Divine 
Feminine is deeply disappointing. 
New Mac Miller is a good, if not a 
great artist. He’s also only 24 years 
old. Regardless, the Mac Miller of 
The Divine Feminine needs to do 
some serious soul searching before 
he tries his hand at another “pro-
gressive” concept album.

FILM NOTEBOOK

A few weeks ago, my friend and 

Daily Film colleague Jacob Rich 
wrote an impassioned plea for us 
all to listen to The Canon, a movie 
of the week podcast in which two 
film critics, Devin Faraci and Amy 
Nicholson, debate whether a given 
movie belongs in the “canon,” a 
collection of “the great films to 
live on forever,” whatever that 
means. For Jacob, listening to 
a new episode of The Canon is 
something of a weekly ritual, and 
I don’t blame him for it; there’s 
something magical about hav-
ing your film agenda defined by 
“enlightened” film-watchers.

But I’m not as convinced by 

the strength of The Canon. Jacob 
is right to note that the podcast’s 
defining feature is the banter 
between its two co-hosts. They 
are certainly far from a myth of 
public radio personalities that 
can verge on sleep-inducement, 
but Jacob clearly doesn’t listen to 
the right public radio. Folks like 
Elvis Mitchell and David Edel-
stein match Faraci and Nicholson 
in their passion, but it comes out 
more in their words rather than 
their tone. Plus, these public radio 
critics maintain some semblance 
of decency in their commentary 
that doesn’t demean their co-
workers or, worse, their listeners.

The 
conversations 
in 
The 

Canon, 
meanwhile, 
invariably 

feature an extremely arrogant 
and aggressive Faraci constantly 
speaking over and launching ad 
hominem attacks at a quiet and 
always-wrong Nicholson. Nichol-

son’s research seems to be lifted 
from IMDb trivia pages and Fara-
ci’s “textual analysis” seems to be 
less a detailed train of thought and 
more constantly referring to him-
self as a New Yorker even though 
it seems like the last time he lived 
there was in his childhood. It’s 
infuriating: I want to root for 
Nicholson because Faraci is so 
profoundly an affront to respect-
able human interaction, but I find 
her film tastes so poor that I am 
constantly let down. Ugh.

If Jacob wishes to question 

long-standing academic notions 
of film, like the auteur theory, 
perhaps he should also question 
the desirability (and, frankly, 
possibility) of having a “canon.” 
In The Canon, any time one host 
questions how to define the quali-
fications for entry into the canon 
(Importance? Quality? Impact?), 
the episode inevitably becomes 
a referendum on the point of the 
podcast itself. That both hosts 
use self-serving arguments sur-
rounding qualifications in each 
episode to justify a film’s inclusion 
or exclusion proves the idea of a 
canon is arbitrary to its core. I’m a 
proponent of debate, but the act of 
defining terms, especially defin-
ing the central idea of the whole 
podcast, should precede the pod-
cast.

Plus, the podcast only serves 

to divide the world of film into 
“haves and have-nots.” Let’s make 
the reasonable assumption that 
the end goal of this podcast is to 
create a final list of films in the 
canon, while noting which films 
did not enter the canon. Wouldn’t 
that dissuade a budding and curi-

ous film audience from watching 
those movies that didn’t make the 
cut? All movies offer us something. 
Even poor films can serve a pur-
pose; we can use all films to trace 
techniques, moods and themes to 
construct a meaningful narrative 
of the human experience since the 
birth of the art form.

I offer an alternative: it’s anoth-

er film of the week podcast, with 
bickering that remains within 
the realm of respectability. Each 
pair of episodes (bi-weekly two-
parters) contains a current release 
and a film from the past that can 
teach us something about the 
current release. Recent episodes 
include the first and latest “Star 
Wars” films; “The Neon Demon” 
and “Suspiria,” an Italian hor-
ror film with similar themes and 
styles; and “Finding Dory” and 
“Memento.” Safe to say, the film 
choices run the gamut from main-
stream to arthouse, domestic to 
foreign, old to new, good to bad.

The podcast is The Next Picture 

Show and it was started by alumni 
of The Dissolve, a beloved website 
that offered some of the greatest 
film writing I have ever read. To 
quote the opening mantra repeat-
ed in each episode, “No film exists 
in a vacuum. All culture is more 
interesting in context.” That’s not 
debatable. Film is a medium that 
exists to transport us through time 
and space. When we talk about 
film, we talk about what it copies, 
steals, alludes to and references. 
The Film School generation and 
the current postmodern film land-
scape of directors all abide by this 
principle. Why shouldn’t our pod-
cast tastes?

The Divine Feminine

Mac Miller

Warner Bros.

Performing an orchestra con-

cert takes a considerable number 
of people. It takes an orchestra’s 
worth, of course, 
but behind the 
scenes there are 
even more indi-
viduals 
working 

to 
manage 
all 

of 
the 
logistics 

of such a large 
endeavor. 

Understand-

ably, it’s difficult, 
and in this model, 
it becomes useful 
to rely on pieces 
of music which 
are mostly known 
to the musicians, 
pulled from a col-
lection of standard repertoire 
which has crystallized over the 
last century and a half. Playing 
new and contemporary work pro-
vides challenges, and most living 
composers have their orchestral 
music performed quite rarely. 
But most composers aren’t John 
Adams.

On Friday the 23rd the Univer-

sity Symphony Orchestra, under 
the direction of Kenneth Kiesler, 
will be giving their inaugural 
performance of the year, featur-
ing music by John Adams and 
George Gershwin.

Adams is perhaps the most 

famous living American concert 
composer. He is more frequently 
performed than any other Ameri-
can composer alive and has been 
the focus of national and interna-
tional fame for the better part of 
three decades, since the premiere 
of his well-known opera “Nixon 
in China.” On Friday the USO will 
be playing two pieces, spanning 
from his “Nixon in China” era to 
the present decade.

The larger of the two Adams 

pieces being performed is more 
recent, his “Saxophone Con-
certo,” which will feature Music 
Prof. Timothy McAllister as solo-

ist, a role he also filled at the pre-
miere of the concerto in 2013.

“I met him because the Los 

Angeles Philharmonic brought 
him in to play the solo sax part in a 
piece I’d written for the first con-

cert with [Gustavo 
Dudamel] as music 
director, 
a 
piece 

called ‘City Noir,’ 
” Adams said in an 
interview with The 
Michigan 
Daily. 

“There’s a sort of 
jazz inflected part 
that was very dif-
ficult, 
and 
they 

felt that nobody in 
the LA area was 
really 
appropriate 

to play it, so they 
brought Tim in, and 
I 
was 
absolutely 

entranced by his 

talent and his skill. So I decided 
to write a concerto for him.”

The saxophone is not generally 

thought of in the context of classi-
cal music. Most people first came 
to know it through the iconic 
sound of jazz music, and Adams is 
no different.

“I discovered the saxophone 

largely through listening to a lot 
of great jazz players, and I think 
I had that sound and that kind 
of spontaneity in mind and was 
trying to translate that into a 
work which, obviously, has more 
formal outlines,” Adams said. “I 
didn’t want to write a piece that 
called for the saxophonist to 
improvise his or her own ideas, 
I wanted to make a work that 
sounded or felt like it was largely 
improvised but at the same time 
was very specifically notated.”

This sense of jazz-derived lib-

erty appropriately links the “Sax-
ophone Concerto” to Adams’s 
earlier piece, “City Noir,” which 
was heavily jazz influenced and 
was how the saxophonist McAl-
lister and the composer Adams 
first met. Decades before either 
of these pieces, however, Adams 
was writing a very different style 
of music, as the other Adams piece 

on the program, “The Chairman 
Dances,” demonstrates.

“I think my work has evolved,” 

Adams said. “I think a work like 
‘The Chairman Dances’ is proba-
bly a little more — parts of it — are 
a little more pulse-driven. You 
don’t quite feel that consistent, 
inevitable pulse in the sax con-
certo that you feel in ‘The Chair-
man Dances.’ ”

“The Chairman Dances” is an 

example of Adams’s earlier style, 
which has been described as post-
minimalism, though the compos-
er has eschewed that term in favor 
of “post-style.” Given Adams’s 
artistic evolution over the years, 
this latter term does indeed seem 
to be the most accurate descrip-
tion of his work as a whole.

“Each piece is its own little 

world,” Adams said. “I don’t like 
to repeat myself. There are a lot 
of artists, and painters and even 
some composers who find a suc-
cessful template and they tend to 
repeat it, just slightly altering it. 
But I try to — for lack of a better 
term — develop an entirely unique 
DNA for each piece. I think each 
one of my pieces is uniquely dif-
ferent from all the others.”

Complementing Adams’s par-

tially jazz-inspired selections is 
the rest of the evening’s program, 
which is comprised of two pieces 
by the extremely famous 20th-
century 
American 
composer 

George Gershwin, who is known 
for his fusion of the jazz and clas-
sical genres.

The concert will feature Music 

Prof. Logan Skelton performing 
Gershwin’s 1925 “Piano Concerto 
in F” — which is the composer’s 
second most known composition 
for piano and orchestra, after his 
universally recognized “Rhapso-
dy in Blue” — and his symphonic 
poem “An American in Paris,” 
which is based on the composer’s 
experience abroad in the French 
capital of the 1920s. Both of the 
Gershwin pieces are new critical 
editions, and this will be the first 
time that these editions will be 
performed.

BOOK REVIEW

How far will someone go to 

uncover the truth? This is the 
central question in the excel-
lent second novel 
of Anuradha Roy, 
“Sleeping on Jupi-
ter.” The book has 
received 
nearly 

universal 
praise, 

winning the pres-
tigious DSC Prize 
for South Asian Lit-
erature and being 
long-listed for the 
Man Booker Prize. The work of fic-
tion critiques hypocrisies in Indian 
culture in the context of the small 
tourist town of Jarmuli, which is 
famous for its ancient temples, but 
is also hiding dark secrets of abuse 
and misogyny.

The novel switches between 

three seemingly separate stories, 
slowly weaving them into each 
other as the text goes on. We first 
meet Nomi, a young filmmaker 
trying to piece together the his-

tory of her trau-
matic childhood on 
assignment in Jar-
muli. On the train 
there 
she 
meets 

three older women 
on holiday, long-
time friends eager 
to enjoy one last 
adventure together. 
Once in Jarmuli, 

the women are shown around an 
ancient temple by Badal the monk, 
who struggles over his lust for 
the boy who works at his favorite 
tea stand. The three stories are 
brought together by chance, but 
end up having immense conse-

quences over each and every per-
son involved. 

Indian-born novelist Roy crafts 

a riveting tale of religion, fam-
ily and violence that is nearly 
impossible to put down. Central 
to this book is a damning por-
trayal of religious tourism, paint-
ing Badal as one of many temple 
guides who rip off their patrons 
under the guise of a higher power. 
Nomi’s background is a disturb-
ing critique of religious zealots, an 
unwitting victim of a civil war and 
repeated sexual abuse at the hands 
of a religious guru, who, ironically, 
is treated as a god by the Western 
tourists who visit his ashram.

The novel sometimes falls into 

unreliable narration. However, 
this is not a disadvantage for the 
text. Rather, it serves as character 
development. Gouri, one of the 
elderly woman, is slowly losing her 
memory, and her forgetfulness as 
a narrator is all too familiar for 
those who have seen a grandpar-
ent fall into the same patterns. 
Nomi’s understanding of what 
happened to her as a child is pep-
pered with holes, mainly due to 
her young age at the time of her 
trauma, as well as the purposeful 
repression of disturbing memo-
ries.

“Sleeping on Jupiter” is not a 

happy book. It does not answer 
questions about the fates of the 
characters, or the reasons why 
certain actions are taken. But 
that’s okay. The novel is a peek into 
five days in the lives of a few truly 
unordinary people. Much of what 
we learn about the characters is 
accumulated in pieces, through 
dialogue, reminiscing, and in the 
case of Nomi, occasional flash-
backs. As readers, Roy wants us 
to know we are not entitled to the 
knowledge of what happens after 
the five days are over. If anything, 
we should be happy we were even 
given such an intimate look in the 
first place. Brilliant choices like 
these are what gives “Sleeping on 
Jupiter” so much weight — specu-
lating what happens to the charac-
ters is enough to keep a person up 
at night.

Michigan made it through its non-conference schedule by 
winning three tune-ups, each a bit more challenging than the 
last. Now comes the Big Ten season, and the fourth-ranked 
Wolverines have their best chance for a conference title in years. 
The first test is Saturday at Michigan Stadium against a Penn 
State team that comes in as another double-digit underdog.

Wolverines prepare for first conference 
game against Nittany Lions on Saturday

The Michigan football team 

opens up conference play on 
Saturday 
against 
Penn 
State 

(2-1), 
a 
team 

desperate 
to 

prove its worth. 
The 
Nittany 

Lions 
finished 

last 
season 

4-4 in Big Ten 
play, and after 
two 
mediocre 

seasons 
under 

coach 
James 

Franklin, 
Penn 

State is in need of 
a pick-me-up. 

A win over the 

fourth-ranked 
Wolverines 
would do just that, but after 
struggling 
against 
Temple 

last week — ultimately pulling 
through to win 34-17 — and losing 
to in-state rival Pittsburgh the 
week before, it’s not likely Penn 
State will be able to pull it off at 
Michigan Stadium. 

The Nittany Lions have a 

few key players absent due to 
injury, complicating that effort 
even 
more. 
Three 
starting 

linebackers are injured, with 
Nyeem 
Wartman-White 

definitely out against Michigan. 
He will miss the rest of the 
season after suffering an injury 
against Temple. Fellow starting 
linebackers Brandon Bell and 
Jason Cabinda are injured as well, 
with their statuses for Saturday’s 
game unknown. Wide receiver 
Saeed Blacknall, who had two 
receptions in Penn State’s season 
opener, has also been absent since 
early September. 

On the other side of the ball, 

the statuses of Michigan senior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 
Lewis, 

senior 
defensive 
end 
Taco 

Charlton and redshirt sophomore 
defensive tackle Bryan Mone 
are still unknown. All three are 
starters on the defense, and it 
would be valuable to have the trio 
back to begin Big Ten play. Senior 
cornerback Channing Stribling 
indicated that Lewis practiced 
on Tuesday, but it is unknown if 
Mone or Charlton are practicing. 

Michigan’s biggest challenge 

will come against the Nittany 
Lions’ 
offense. 
Redshirt 

sophomore 
quarterback 
Trace 

McSorley leads the Big Ten in 
passing with 828 yards over three 
games. Recently, against Temple, 
he went 18-for-24 and showed 
off his deep ball on a 52-yard 
touchdown pass. 

“Penn State’s offense, they’ve 

got a very good quarterback, 
they’ve got a very good running 
back, 
they’ve 
got 
very 
good 

players that I think are very good 
for that (no-huddle system),” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“So it’s another challenge for us 
and why we treat every game 
like it’s a championship game. 
It’s a big game. Every opponent 
on our schedule comes in with a 
strong will to defeat us and good 
coaching and good players.” 

Running back Saquon Barkley 

has already collected six rushing 
touchdowns this season, so expect 
Michigan to give him special 
attention early. Against Temple, 
the sophomore averaged 7.6 yards 
per run and recorded a 55-yard 

touchdown. Last season against 
Michigan, Barkley racked up 68 
yards but still underperformed 
compared to his season average of 
97.8 rushing yards per game. 

Monday, 
senior 
linebacker 

Mike McCray said he was looking 
forward to facing the challenges 
Barkley would bring. 

“He’s a great back,” McCray said. 

“He’s going to be a good challenge 
for us, to go against one of the top 
backs in the country. We’re up to 
the challenge, though.”

While 
Penn 
State 
won’t 

be 
Michigan’s 
toughest 
Big 

Ten 
competition 
this 
season, 

Harbaugh 
is 
maintaining 
his 

attitude that every game should 
be treated the same. 

“The way we’ve looked at it, 

we were out to be at our best 
every single week,” Harbaugh 
said. “As we assess the schedule 
from the start of the schedule, 
every opponent that we play was 
going to have to be treated with 
the utmost respect. Preparation 
was going to have to be precise 
and locked in and focused to give 
ourselves the best chance to be 
successful in the football game. … 
Every game is a big game. Every 
game is a championship game.”

Standing in the parking lot 

outside the tunnel of Michigan 
Stadium on a June afternoon in 
2015, Shane Morris spoke with 
arms folded and a smirk creeping 
up on his face, exuding the same 
confidence he had when he first 
arrived on campus in 2013 as an 
elite high school quarterback with a 
cannon for a left arm.

The long-presumed heir to the 

Wolverines’ offense was serving as an 
instructor at coach Jim Harbaugh’s 
Aerial Assault quarterback camp, and 
he was fielding questions about his 
latest competition for the starting job: 
Iowa graduate transfer Jake Rudock, 
who had arrived on campus two 
weeks earlier.

“Right now, it’s my job to lose,” 

Morris said. “He came here to take 
my job, and I’m just not gonna let it 
happen.”

Morris delivered the words with 

all the conviction of somebody who 
had already been handed the keys. 
Even with just two starts under his 
belt, an experienced quarterback 
to compete with and a new head 

coach to boot, it was almost as if 
Morris couldn’t believe anyone was 
questioning his destiny.

Anointed as one of the nation’s 

top quarterbacks when he was 
just a high school sophomore at 
Warren (Mich.) De La Salle, Morris 
knew how talented he was. As a 
lifelong Michigan fan who rejected 
numerous other offers from better 
programs to come to Ann Arbor — 
including Nick Saban’s Alabama — 
he was born for the job.

Most of the Wolverines’ fanbase 

knew his name long before he set 
foot on campus. In most of their 
minds, he was going to be the 
quarterback to usher in a new golden 
age of Michigan football. It just 
never panned out that way.

Fast forward to August 2016, at 

Michigan’s team media day, and 
another quarterback competition 
rages on. But now Morris sits 
alone at his locker, while a throng 
of reporters first gathers around 
redshirt sophomore Wilton Speight 
and redshirt junior John O’Korn. 
Morris didn’t beat Rudock for the 

job last season, and now he’s being 
written off as a distant third-place 
finisher for the coming season.

By the time reporters finally 

approach him — and when he speaks 
to a slightly larger crowd a few weeks 
later — it first appears that not much 
has changed about the now-redshirt 
junior. The confidence, the fire and 
the devotion to football are all still 
there. The familiar smirk even shows 
itself when he says he’s capable of 
being the starting quarterback, and 
that he’s right there in the race, no 
matter how the media views it.

But what is missing is the sense 

of entitlement. The same player 
that once implied that Rudock 
would be taking not just his job but 
also his “livelihood” now speaks 
as a gracious competitor, not the 
Wolverines’ Chosen One.

“I’m not really focused on just 

being the starting quarterback and 
making the perfect play,” he says. 
“Other things in life matter.”

Morris’ path in Ann Arbor has not 

gone the way most people expected. 
The hotshot 18-year-old who was 

supposed to be the face of the Brady 
Hoke era has become a humbled and 
hardened 22-year-old after enduring 
years of public scrutiny. He’s had 
rival high school crowds bitterly 
taunt him, diehard Michigan fans 
bark at him from behind keyboards, 
and television cameras camp out on 
his family’s street for all the wrong 
reasons.

This was the same elite recruit 

who arrived on campus with the 
expectation to take the reins as soon 
as he was ready, but he never quite 
reached his ceiling. That’s why it’s 
so interesting to hear how he sums 
up his experience, just weeks before 
he begins what could be his final 
season at Michigan.

“It’s a dream come true for me,” 

Morris says, “and I couldn’t ask for 
anything more.”

* * *

Morris made his debut in his 

first game on campus, against 
Central Michigan on Aug. 31, 2013. 
He wasn’t handed the quarterback 

job — Devin Gardner was the well-
established starter — but in the 
third quarter of a blowout game, 
the jumbotron at Michigan Stadium 
showed Hoke place his hand on the 
back of Morris’ No. 7 jersey and send 
him onto the field. He promptly led 
his team right down the field on a 
touchdown drive.

“It (was) very overwhelming,” 

said 
Jennifer 
Morris, 
Shane’s 

mother. “I know I remember crying 
when he ran through the tunnel for 
the first time. To watch him and to 
see his dream come true out there 
was just unbelievable.”

Morris spent all of his first season 

sitting behind Gardner before a 
golden opportunity appeared at 
the end of the season. Gardner 
was ruled out for the Buffalo Wild 
Wings Bowl against Kansas State 
with a broken left foot sustained in 
the regular-season finale against 
Ohio State, and Morris got the call 
to make his first start.

Despite losing to the Wildcats, 

31-14, Morris completed 24 of 38 
passes for 196 yards and showed

Shane Morris Stays Blue

off his athleticism with a 40-yard 
run late in the game. It wasn’t a 
particularly flashy performance, but 
it was a showcase of his skills and a 
promising sign for the future.

Morris even got to bring his 

family along for the game, resulting 
in what his father called “one of the 
neatest times we’ve ever had with 
him as an athlete.” As the family 
took advantage of one hour of free 
time during bowl week to hit a 
drive-through restaurant for dinner, 
the excitement of the Michigan 
experience finally hit them.

“We sat in the car, the whole 

family just kinda talking about it 
and laughing and picking at him and 
just enjoying it,” said Shane’s father, 
Bruce. “It was exciting — he was 
very excited. From the bottom of his 
heart, he loves that university and 
he loves that program.”

* * *

Just nine months after that 

moment, everything came crashing 
down.

Reporters are parked outside the 

Morris family’s house. They’ve come 
by so often that Jennifer Morris has 
to call her husband on her way home 
from work to ask if they’re gone. 
They aren’t.

It’s the last week of September 2014, 

and Shane’s image is plastered over 
almost every major television network 
in America. By now, the details of 
Morris’s second career start on Sept. 
27 are practically common knowledge. 
Morris struggled early in his attempt 
to spark the scuffling 2-2 Wolverines 
against Minnesota, and then a pair of 
hard tackles left him with both a severe 
ankle sprain and what would later be 
infamously labeled a “probable, mild 
concussion.”

Morris was briefly 

left in the game after 
both injuries despite 
nearly collapsing in 
offensive 
lineman 

Ben Braden’s arms, 
and he later was 
reinserted into the 
game for a play after 
Gardner had finally 
relieved him. ESPN’s 
commentators 
lambasted 
the 

coaching staff on live television 
for appearing to endanger their 
quarterback, and the rest was 
unfortunate history.

In a bitter twist of fate, the 

presumed poster child for the Hoke 
era of Michigan football suddenly 
became unwittingly painted as a 
symbol of the program’s dysfunction.

It was a rough time for the entire 

Morris 
family. 
“Good 
Morning 

America” came to the Morris house 
three times in a week. Bruce had 
his phone blow up with calls from 
multiple media outlets. One network 
reporter even told the family that 
the public “had a right to know” 
what they were thinking.

But for Shane’s parents (who 

maintained 
communication 
with 

Hoke and the team trainer, among 
other Michigan officials, but never 

spoke to the public), 
the concern wasn’t 
about the scandal, 
but about their son’s 
mental 
well-being. 

Not only was Shane 
worried about the 
university he loved 
coming under fire — 
his “biggest concern 
in the whole deal,” 
according 
to 
his 

father — he also was 

afraid it meant the end of his dream.

“I got the sense that he felt like he 

would never get another shot,” Bruce 
said. “Like he took that burden, 
he kind of put that whole burden 
on himself of that game. Which is, 
that’s what you’re supposed to do as 
a quarterback, as a quote-unquote 
leader, and a guy in that position. 

I just kind of tried to, not take that 
away from him, if you will, as far as 
not completely dismiss that — I just 
kind of wanted to put everything in 
perspective. ‘At the end of the day, 
you’re still a part of this team and 
you all still have work to do.’ ”

Neither 
Hoke 
nor 
Athletic 

Director 
Dave 
Brandon 
would 

keep their jobs through the end 
of the year, leaving Morris as the 
only remnant of the debacle. Even 
though it was, to date, his final start 
at Michigan, the young quarterback 
leaned on his support system and 
found a way to remove himself from 
the fire. In the end, it may have been 
that guidance that saved him.

“It was a tough deal,” Morris said. 

“Obviously it got to me a little bit, 
having to go through all that. But 
my teammates, my roommates, my 
parents and the coaching staff did 
a great job kind of keeping it away 
from me, keep me away from it. They 
didn’t make me do any interviews or 
anything like that, so I was never 
directly involved in it, and I think 
that helped a lot. … It’s the past of 
my life. I don’t really think about it 
at all anymore.”

* * *

As he battled with Rudock for 

the 
starting 
job 
the 
following 

season, Morris started to let some 
of the pressure go to his head. 
When he threw a pick in practice 
or overthrew a receiver, he said he 
would immediately let the mistake 
ruin his day and start throwing the 
ball all over the place.

He maintained his confidence 

in interviews off the field, but he 
found himself struggling to rebound 
quickly 
from 
football 
mistakes. 

To make matters worse, he was 
struggling to learn his third offense 
in three seasons, and the head coach 
who brought him to Michigan was 
gone. Despite his successes in high 
school, Morris just couldn’t find a 
way to play up to not just the fans’ 
expectations, but his own.

“I think all quarterbacks have it — 

when they make a mistake, it gets in 
their head, just like any player,” said 
Paul Verska, Morris’ coach at De La 
Salle. “You try to tell them that the 
most important play is the next play 
and it’s part of the growing process 
where you have to let it go. … Being 
able to shut it out is a tough thing 
to do, but it’s something you do and 
mature.”

After Morris lost the job to 

Rudock and was written off again 
this season, though, a curious thing

Redshirt junior quarterback Shane Morris has never managed to take hold of the starting job at Michigan after arriving as one of the top recruits in the nation, but he feels content with the way his college career has ended up.

university and 
he loves that 
program.”

happened.

Instead of letting the frustration 

ruin him, Morris let the burden 
that he had carried on his back 
since he was 16 years old slowly slip 
away. His world didn’t crumble — if 
anything, he learned that his world 
and football were not always one 
and the same.

Part of that realization came 

from having a strong foundation of 
loved ones to back him up. Morris 
still calls or texts his parents 
every day, and he mentioned that 
his girlfriend of two years, Irene, 
a recent Michigan graduate, is 
always there after games. (“She’s a 
keeper,” he said with a smile.)

“As college has gone on, you 

kind of learn to put things in front 
of yourself and not 
make yourself the 
most 
important,” 

Morris said. “Kind 
of 
realize 
you’ve 

got 
other 
things 

that are way more 
important, 
like 

other people. … I 
feel like I’ve done 
that. I’ve become 
a 
much 
happier 

person, 
enjoying 

life and really taking in all it has to 
offer.”

It’s not clear when, exactly, 

Morris’ mindset shifted. Bruce 
Morris isn’t sure it ever did, but 
thinks rather that Shane simply 
decided to “(wear) it a little more 
on (his) sleeve.”

In 
any 
case, 
the 
constant 

competition has helped Morris’ 
game on the field just as much as it 
maintained his confidence off of it. 
No longer does he cringe when he 
throws an interception in practice 
or dwell on the fact that he’s not 
the first player taking snaps on 
Saturdays.

He’s also managed to solve 

the one problem that a number 
of 
players 
probably 
couldn’t: 

separating his love for Michigan 
from his love for football.

“He 
approaches 
things 

differently, I think,” Bruce Morris 
said. “His team is very important to 
him. He loves them guys, he truly 
loves his teammates and the guys. 
That’s one of the things, I think, 
that keeps a lot of those guys going 
when they feel like they should 
be the starter, if you will, because 
every one of them do.”

His teammates have noticed, 

too. 
Wilton 
Speight 
was 
an 

early enrollee during the second 
semester of Morris’ freshman year, 
and Morris took him under his wing 
as soon as he got on campus. Now, 
over two years later, Speight holds 

the starting quarterback job that 
Morris coveted, but he still finds 
ways he can learn from Morris.

“That kid’s been through a lot,” 

Speight said. “With the whole 
Minnesota debacle, how much 
hype he came in with, the coaching 
changes and stuff — he’s stayed 
very level-headed through it all. 
He’s never gotten too down, he’s 
never gotten too high. He’s just a 
really chill dude. And I see that if 
he can maintain that roller coaster 
that he’s been through and been 
just the same dude, then no matter 
what I go through this season as 
the starter or not, hopefully I can 
remain a chill dude, too.”

* * *

It’s unclear what the future 

holds for Shane Morris, but he has 
no regrets about his last four years, 

no matter how it 
played out.

“When I was 17, 

18 years old, you 
can kind of let (the 
hype) get to you and 
start to think you’re 
expected 
to 
do 

these things, when 
in 
reality 
you’re 

not expected to do 
anything,” 
Morris 

said. “The fact that 

I’m here playing football at the 
University of Michigan and getting 
a degree from here is amazing 
enough in itself. You’ve gotta kind 
of realize that as you get older.

“I just turned 22 (on August 4). 

You grow up and you kinda realize 
how life works. All you can do 
is go through life, and I believe 
everything happens for a reason. 
Just keep fighting and work as hard 
as you can.”

There was a time when Morris 

probably couldn’t have imagined 
life after football. But in April, he 
will graduate with a degree in sport 
management and may leave it behind 
forever. There is no set alternative in 
mind, but his father speculates that 
his love for getting to know people 
might lead him into something like 
business or coaching.

Still, the fact that Morris took 

a redshirt year last season leaves 
him with an opportunity to play 
his final year of eligibility next 
season either at Michigan or as a 
graduate transfer somewhere else, 
a la Rudock. Even Morris’ own 
parents have heard rumors from 
strangers that their son might be 
transferring.

But for the Morrises, it’s easy 

to laugh that off. As of now, they 
say there has never even been a 
discussion.

“He’s blue, let me tell you,” Bruce 

said. “He would have left a long 
time ago, would he not have?”

my life. I don’t

it anymore.”

Behind Enemy Lines: Brandon Bell

Last season, then-No. 13 Michigan 

quieted a raucous Happy Valley when 
it defeated the Nittany Lions, 28-16. 
Though the Wolverines controlled 
Penn State throughout all four 
quarters, the Nittany Lions did hold 
them to just 87 rushing yards for an 
average of 2.9 yards per run. 

Senior linebacker Brandon Bell led 

his unit’s attack on the running game, 
recording five total tackles, one for a 
loss of seven yards. More memorably, 
he 
recorded 
his 
second 
career 

interception in the first quarter, 
returning it 25 yards into Michigan 
territory. But Penn State failed to take 
advantage, going three-and-out on 
the following drive.

Later in the game, Bell gave 

his 
teammates 
favorable 
field 

position 
once 
more 
when 
he 

stripped quarterback Jake Rudock 
and recovered the fumble on the 
Wolverines’ 42-yard line. Bell’s 
recovery resulted in a field goal, 
putting his team within eight 
points of Michigan, but it ultimately 
wasn’t enough.

This Saturday, when the Nittany 

Lions 
(2-1) 
travel 
to 
Michigan 

Stadium, Bell may not get to see 
the field, posing a large problem for 
Penn State. In his first two games of 
the season, he posted eight and nine 
tackles, respectively, before being 
sidelined with an injury last week. 

In July, the Daily spoke with Bell 

at Big Ten Media Days in Chicago to 
discuss his valuable role last season, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh and 
rivalries. 

The Michigan Daily: I know you 

had a big game against Michigan 
last season, but it didn’t end in Penn 
State’s favor. What was that game 
like, and what are you going to do 
differently this time around?

Brandon Bell: That game was 

fun. I mean, I was looking forward 
to playing Michigan again for the 
second time in my career — third 
time, but not really (playing much) 
the first time. I think we definitely 
have to be more consistent. I think 
Michigan was more consistent than 
we were. When it came down to the 
end of the game, they made the plays 
that were presented to them. If we 
(are) more consistent, we have a 
chance of making those plays.

TMD: What will it be like to play in 

the Big House this time around?

BB: I think it will be great. I’m 

looking forward to it. It’s my last 
chance to play there. I have a few 
friends on the team, so I’m looking 
forward to it.

TMD: Who are your friends on the 

team?

BB: Freshman Ahmir Mitchell. 

He’s like a little brother to me back 
home, same (home) town. I know 
his older brother. He’s been talking a 
little trash to me, so I’m excited.

(Note: Mitchell left Michigan prior 

to the start of the season in early 
September. He transferred to another 
Big Ten East team, Rutgers, but will sit 
out this season due to transfer rules.)

TMD: He’s talking trash already?
BB: Yeah, just a little bit.
TMD: Do you think you’ll be 

seeing him play as a freshman?

BB: I hope I do! I mean I’m not sure 

how he’s been doing, but if he gets a 

chance to get on the field, I hope I see 
him.

TMD: What do you think of all of 

this Harbaugh mania and everything? 
Do you like playing against all of that?

BB: Yeah, I kinda like it. I mean, 

I don’t — he’s kinda funny. Just 
watching him today, some of the 
things — I think it’s real, which is a 
big thing, for the people that might be 
skeptical. I think that’s really who he 
is, so I love it. At the end of the day, 
we’re just playing football. 

Question: A lot of your success, of 

course, is going to be judged by games 
against Michigan, Michigan State, 
Ohio State, and even Pitt, an in-state 
rival. Do you sense that, that in order 
to get to that next level that fans want 
to be at, do you feel that this is kind 
of a big year for you to make a bigger 
step against those teams?

BB: I mean definitely. Every year 

and every game is a big step. We 
don’t wanna go out there — we’re not 
playing to lose. So I mean, definitely 
with Pitt, it’s kind of a fan game. A 
lot of Pennsylvania people go to each 
school, so it kind of has become a 
rivalry. In terms of Michigan and 
Ohio State, those are the top-tier 
teams, and those guys have the 
target on their back that everyone is 
shooting for.

Q: Coach Franklin says you guys 

have expectations this year. What do 
you think they are?

BB: I say, Big Ten — get to 

Indianapolis. I mean, when you’re 
playing against Ohio State, Michigan, 
Michigan State, that’s what they’re 
shooting for. That’s the top tier. 
There’s no reason we shouldn’t be 
right there with them.

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Penn State

In the last meeting between 

Michigan and Penn State, in State 
College last November, both teams 
scored four times.

The difference in the game was 

that Michigan’s four scores were 
all touchdowns, while Penn State 
stalled for short field goals three 
times in a 28-16 loss. The Nittany 
Lions finished 3-for-14 on third 
down with just nine points on three 
red-zone trips.

That might well be the story 

when the teams match up again 
Saturday at Michigan Stadium. The 
Big Ten East foes’ stats have many 
disparities, but the biggest one is 
this: Penn State ranks 118th in the 
country on third down, converting 
27.3 percent of its chances, while 
Michigan leads the country in 
third-down defense, allowing a 
10.5 percent conversion rate.

The Nittany Lions have to do 

much better to have a chance 
Saturday, but they will likely still 
be the toughest opponent the 
Wolverines have faced. Here’s how 
the teams stack up:

Michigan rush offense vs. Penn 
State rush defense

Michigan’s ground game eased 

some of the concerns last week 
against Colorado, rushing for 168 
yards on 4.1 per carry with three 
touchdowns. Senior De’Veon Smith 
played his best game of the season, 
carrying 11 times for 87 yards and 
a score, and the unit had just two 
negative rushes, not counting sacks.

Last year, the Wolverines totaled 

just 87 rushing yards against 
Penn State, but in this matchup, 
the Nittany Lions’ front seven is 
hurting. Since the season opener, 
Penn State has lost all three starting 
linebackers — Brandon Bell, Jason 
Cabinda and Nyeem Wartman-
White 
— 
to 
injury. 
Manny 

Bowen, Brandon Smith and Jake 
Cooper will start in their places, 
respectively. Once considered a 
position of strength, that’s a severe 
depth issue for a unit that will 
match up with Michigan redshirt 
junior fullbacks Khalid Hill and 
Henry Poggi in the run game.

As a byproduct of those injuries, 

the Nittany Lions now rank 92nd in 
the country in rush defense at 176.3 
yards per game. Their two leading 

tacklers are in the secondary, and 
their next two are injured, though 
they have had 28 tackles for loss 
from 17 different players. Michigan 
may try to pound the ball against 
that undermanned front.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan pass offense vs. Penn 
State pass defense

For the first time this season, 

Michigan’s passing game looked 
out of sync on Saturday. Redshirt 
sophomore 
quarterback 
Wilton 

Speight completed just 53 percent 
of his passes (16 of 30) and took 
three sacks. Top wide receivers 
Amara Darboh and Jehu Chesson 
combined for just two catches. 
And the multiple deep balls the 
Wolverines hit against Central 
Florida the previous week weren’t 
there, as Speight completed just 
one long pass.

Offensive 
coordinator 

Tim 
Drevno 
on 
Wednesday 

acknowledged 
areas 
for 

improvement in every facet of that 
game, from pass protection to route 
polishing. One constant has been 
senior tight end Jake Butt, who 
was the team’s leading pass catcher 
again Saturday with seven grabs for 
87 yards. He, Darboh and Chesson 
combined for 203 of Michigan’s 256 
yards last year against Penn State.

The Nittany Lions, meanwhile, 

have been tough on opposing 
quarterbacks. Pass defense is their 
statistical strength, tied for 22nd 
in the country at 168.7 yards per 
game. And while Speight should 
be the most talented opposing 
quarterback Penn State has faced, 
the Nittany Lions have picked off 
the other three four times, broken 
up eight passes and made 10 sacks.

Despite its success, Penn State’s 

secondary has been inconsistent. 
After Kent State and Pittsburgh 
combined to pass for just 220 yards 
in the first two games, Temple piled 
up 286 against the Nittany Lions on 
Saturday. Penn State will have to 
make some adjustments to avoid 
letting Michigan do the same.

Edge: Penn State

Penn State rush offense vs. 
Michigan rush defense

Talk 
around 
Schembechler 

Hall this week has been focused 

on Michigan, as usual, but the one 
Penn State name that has surfaced 
is Saquon Barkley.

The Nittany Lions’ sophomore 

running back blends speed and 
power at 5-foot-11, 223 pounds, 
and is the team’s biggest offensive 
weapon. He led Penn State in 
each of the first three games with 
105, 85 and 68 rushing yards. The 
Wolverines limited him to just 68 
yards on 15 carries last year, and 56 
of those yards came on a single run.

The only other Penn State rusher 

with more than eight carries is 
quarterback 
Trace 
McSorley, 

who has 32 rushes for 38 yards, 
in part because of five sacks. He 
will run the spread offense out 
of the shotgun and be a threat 
to scramble, but his speed isn’t 
anything Michigan hasn’t seen 
before. Overall, the Nittany Lions’ 
rushing offense ranks 113th in the 
country.

On the defensive side, the 

Wolverines cleaned up some of 
the long runs that plagued them 
against Central Florida, giving up 
no rushes of more than 15 yards 
to Colorado. Their rush defense 
still sits at 57th in the country, but 
the UCF game skews that number. 
The Nittany Lions have struggled 
up front in recent years, which 
isn’t a recipe for success against 
Michigan’s defense.

More 
importantly, 
the 

Wolverines 
are 
nearing 
full 

strength. After losing two members 
of their defensive line to injury in 
the opener, they hope to get senior 
defensive end Taco Charlton (ankle) 
back this week. Charlton made 
three tackles for loss and two sacks 
last year against Penn State and will 
be a handful again if he plays.

Edge: Michigan

Penn State pass offense vs. 
Michigan pass defense

The Nittany Lions will be the 

third consecutive up-tempo spread 
offense Michigan has faced, so the 
Wolverines are now accustomed 
to it, and defensive coordinator 
Don Brown vowed to have his 
team prepared. He’s familiar with 
this particular offense, having 
been the defensive coordinator 
at Connecticut in 2011 while 
current 
Penn 
State 
offensive 

coordinator Joe Moorhead was the 
quarterbacks coach.

First-year starting quarterbacks 

like 
McSorley 
don’t 
have 
a 

good track record against the 
Wolverines’ suffocating defense 
in recent years. But McSorley has 
gained experience quickly this 
season, being the only Nittany 
Lions quarterback to throw a pass 
and averaging 276 yards per game. 
He has thrown four touchdowns 

and two interceptions against some 
decent defenses.

Michigan’s 
stifling 
defensive 

backfield 
lost 
some 
ground 

Saturday when it gave up several 
big pass plays against Colorado. 
This should help: The Wolverines 
hope 
All-American 
senior 

cornerback Jourdan Lewis will 
make his season debut Saturday 
after suffering a couple of minor 
injuries. Lewis was excited four 
weeks ago to get his final season 
underway, so he should have plenty 
of energy Saturday.

Elsewhere, 
Michigan 
should 

recover 
from 
a 
lackluster 

performance 
Saturday. 
Fellow 

defensive 
backs 
Channing 

Stribling, Jeremy Clark, Dymonte 
Thomas and Delano Hill are all 
seniors who know how to learn 
from their mistakes, and Penn 
State doesn’t have the weapons that 
Colorado did.

Special teams

The Wolverines have Jabrill 

Peppers on their team.

That’s enough. The do-it-all star 

finally returned his first punt for a 
touchdown last week, going 54 yards 
to secure a Michigan victory. With 
278 all-purpose yards, he would rank

second on Penn State’s team — and 
he has seen two plays of offense 
all season. The Nittany Lions 
kept him in check last season, but 
he’s always a threat to make a big 
play. If that weren’t enough, the 
Wolverines have also tipped two 
punts and blocked a third and 
returned it for a touchdown in the 
past two weeks.

Penn State’s special teams 

have been routinely successful 
this year, with kicker Tyler 
Davis hitting all of his five field-
goal attempts with a long of 40 
yards. Kickoff specialist Joey 
Julius has 16 touchbacks in 21 
tries as he tries to limit Peppers’ 
opportunities. Outside of one 
59-yard punt return, the Nittany 
Lions haven’t broken many big 
plays in the return game.

The only hiccup lately on a 

terrific Michigan unit that ranks 
second in the country in special 
teams efficiency was the kicking 
game against Colorado. Senior 
kicker Kenny Allen missed two of 
his three field-goal tries, from 37 
and 44 yards.

But again: The Wolverines have 

Jabrill Peppers on their team.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

The Big Ten season kicks 

off 
Saturday, 
starting 
the 

title chase for these two East 
division opponents. For now, the 
championship is a more realistic 
goal for the Wolverines, who will 
be fired up to start the conference 
season off right. They’ll also have 
home-field advantage for the 
fourth straight week.

On the other side of the ball, 

Penn State fought back from its 
first loss with a 34-27 victory 
against Temple last week, and 
the Nittany Lions will be trying 
to avenge a home defeat against 
Michigan last season.

The biggest intangible, though, 

may be the players returning for 
the Wolverines, especially Lewis. 
The senior is one of the emotional 
leaders of the team, and besides 
being able to shut down the 
opponent’s 
best 
receiver, 
he 

also brings a mental edge to the 
defense. His teammates admit 
his trash talk on the field fires 
them up.

State 20

BREAKDOWN
From Page 7B

What to watch for on Saturday

With non-conference play over, 

the No. 4 Michigan football team’s 
road is about to get tougher. Coming 
off a 45-28 win over Colorado last 
week, the Wolverines will open Big 
Ten play when they host Penn State 
at Michigan Stadium on Saturday.

The 
teams 
find 
themselves 

in very different places, with 
Michigan in the national title 
picture and the Nittany Lions out 
to re-establish their position as a 
contender in the Big Ten East.

Here’s what to watch for when 

Penn State and Michigan kick off:

1. The injury report:

Saturday could mark the return 

of some of the Wolverines’ top 
defensive playmakers. While the 
status 
of 
redshirt 
sophomore 

defensive 
tackle 
Bryan 
Mone 

remains unclear, Harbaugh has 
publicly conveyed his belief that 
senior cornerback Jourdan Lewis 
and senior defensive end Taco 
Charlton could return to the lineup.

Lewis has not yet played this 

season, missing the first three 
games with a nagging injury that 
has affected his back, quadricep 

and 
hamstring. 
Coaches 
and 

teammates have said Lewis has 
been his usual swaggering self in 
practice and on the sidelines, and if 
he can carry that over to the playing 
field, he could boost a secondary 
that, while highly graded early on, 
has given up a handful of big plays.

Charlton 
went 
down 
in 

Michigan’s opener with an ankle 
injury, but his potential coming 
into the season has many excited 
for what might happen upon his 
return. Playing on the edge of a 
line that includes fifth-year seniors 
Ryan Glasgow and Chris Wormley, 
Charlton would bring even more 
veteran presence to one of the Big 
Ten’s best units.

2. Will Penn State punt to 
Peppers?

Could you blame them if they 

didn’t? Peppers scored his first 
career punt return touchdown 
last week against Colorado, and he 
currently leads the nation in total 
punt return yards with 173.

After a 2015 season that saw him 

come within one or two missed 
tackles of the end zone multiple 
times, Peppers has now broken 
through. What happens next will 
be interesting to watch.

Michigan 
special 
teams 

coordinator Chris Partridge said 
Wednesday that if teams do stop 
kicking to Peppers, the Wolverines’ 
field position would be “incredible.”

How teams choose to weigh the 

balance between the field position 
battle and avoiding the potential for 
a massive play is hard to predict, and 
it becomes even more complicated 
when you factor in Michigan’s 
success in punt blocking. 

Through 
three 
games, 
the 

Wolverines have affected at least 
four punts. So when teams are 
deciding how to approach Peppers, 
their focus also has to be on simply 
getting the punt off.

3. Will Speight bounce back?

After he took a huge hit in the first 

quarter against Colorado, Speight 
was noticeably less potent than in 
his first two games. The Wolverines 
still salvaged a strong day on offense, 
but Michigan will want its starter 
back in form for Big Ten play.

There was no word on whether 

Speight is still feeling the effects of 
that sack, but he did say after the 
game he had never been hit like that.

Part of the issue could have been 

the Buffaloes’ defensive backs, 
who were roundly praised by the 

Wolverines this week. Fifth-year 
senior receivers Jehu Chesson and 
Amara Darboh were held largely 
in check — though each scored a 
touchdown — and will be looking 
for a bounce-back showing as well.

But they’ll need Speight to 

get them the ball, and if his 
performance 
lags, 
Michigan’s 

offense could be in a little trouble.

4. The big play:

It’s possible that it’s entirely too 

early to pinpoint this as a serious 
weakness, but for two straight 
games, Michigan has been burned 
on a handful of big plays.

Against Central Florida, it was 

on the ground. Against Colorado, 
it was through the air. Against 
Penn 
State, 
Michigan 
would 

benefit from shoring those issues 
up. Lewis and Charlton returning 
would likely help, but even the 
best teams in the country can find 
themselves in trouble if they can’t 
contain the big plays.

Penn State’s spread offense 

should give the Wolverines a 
familiar up-tempo look from their 
past two contests. If they can adjust 
off of their miscues from those 
games, Michigan can finally let its 
defense shine.
