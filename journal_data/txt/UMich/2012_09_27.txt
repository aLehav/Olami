UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
'U' research
funding hits
all-time high
at $1.27B

* * * E L E C T I 0 N 2 0 1 2 ,* * *

In last fiscal
year, allocation
increased 3 percent
By IAN DILLINGHAM
For the Daily
Research funding at the Uni-
versity reached a record high of
$1.27 billion last fiscal year, rep-
resenting a 3-percent increase in
total funds received compared
to fiscal year 2011, according to a
report published Sept.-20.
Stephen Forrest, the Univer-
sity's vice president of research,
said the . $37.5 million increase
was not as pronounced as it has
been in previous years due to
decreases ih federal funding.
"(The budget increase is) not as
big as amounts we've seen in the
past, but the biggest impact on
the negative side has been the fact
that the (American Renewal and
Recovery Act) program has basi-

cally drawn to a close," he said in
an interview.
Despite the increase in fund-
ing, total federal contributions
to the research budget declined
by 3.6 percent due to a $60.4 mil-
lion decrease in funding from
stimulus programs. The overall
increase primarily came from a
combination of private, industrial
and internal sources.
"If you subtract out the loss
due to reduction in ARRA fund-
ing, (other funds) all went up and
,that was pretty surprising to us,"
Forrest said. "We actually had a
very good year in spite of the fact
that the federal budget increase
was pretty weak."
The University saw funding
increases from federal agen-
cies such as the National Science
Foundation, the Department
of Energy, the Department of
Defense, NASA and the Depart-
ment of Transportation. The
most notable decrease came from

First-ever event

By ASHWINI NATARAJAN
For the Daily
Despite looming rain clouds,
the first fall Health and Well-
ness Fair still spread its message
of well-being and vitality to the
University on Wednesday after-
noon.
Located in the plazabetween
the new South Hall and Weill

Hall, the event featured 20
booths, including a farmers
market and a massage sta-
tion. The goal of the event was
to inform students, staff and
faculty about healthy lifestyle
changes.
The fair was organized by
Shawna McManus, the direc-
tor of human resources at the
University's Law School, and
Heather Anderson, a University
administrative assistant. Both
are MHealthy champions, a role
dedicated to encourage healthy
habits within their division,
school or department.

McManus and Anderson said
the goal of the fair was to share
their mission with students and
promote MHealthy's goals.
"This is a lifestyle that we
both live," Anderson said. "We
are active, we eat healthy, and
within both of our offices this
is something we wanted to gain
and keep in motion ... so this is
something on alarger scale."
The fair also featured vis-
its by former NFL players Dan
Mozes and Damion Cook.

Japan and China enter talks
over bitter island dispute

Leaders meet at
U.N. and in Beijing
as tensions rise
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Japan
and China are taking small steps
to dampen a bitter dispute over
a group of small islands in the
East China Sea following an
intense but seemingly controlled
confrontation over the islands'
sovereignty that introduced
wildcard Taiwan in the fray.
Foreign ministers from Tokyo
and Beijing met late Tuesday on
the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly in New York to discuss
the issue, two weeks after the
Japanese government's purchase
of some of the islands from pri-
vate owners sparked bitter anti-
Japanese protests in China and
raised tensions between the two
Asian giants to their highest level
in years.
Vice foreign ministers from
the two countries met the same
day in Beijing.
Despite the promise of the
meetings, it is still too early
to conclude that the crisis has
passed. China is almost certainto
send its own vessels to challenge
Japanese control of the islands,
raising the possibility of armed

conflict arising from mistake or
miscalculation.
Tuesday's Japan-China meet-
ings came just hours after Japa-
nese and Taiwanese coast guard
cutters exchanged water cannon
blasts just off the islands, known
as the Senkakus in Japan and the
Diaoyu or Diaoyuitai in China
and Taiwan. Taiwan also claims
the islands, which sit astride rich
fishing waters and potentially
large reserves of natural gas.
Taiwan, which split from
China amid civil war in 1949 but
has been drawing ever closer to
Beijing in the 4 /a years since Ma
Ying-jeou became president, has
become a wild card in the Japan-
China dispute, staking out what
it claims is an independent stance
to assert its sovereignty over the
islands.
But reflecting its claim that
Taiwan is part of its territory,
China has gone out of its way to
suggest that Taipei's interest in
the islands is identical with its
own. Following Tuesday's con-
frontation between the two coast
guards, China's state-controlled
media offered clear validation
of the Taiwanese actions, pre-
senting detailed coverage of the
presence of some 50 Taiwanese
fishing boats and 12 coast guard
vessels in the disputed island

area.
During the confrontation, the
two sides used water cannon for
the first time, an apparent*esca-
lation in their previously low-key
tactics. But the almost ritualis-
tic nature of the exchange - the
sides separated after only a few
minutes, and the Taiwanese flo-
tilla returned to Taiwan - sug-
gested that Tokyo and Taipei
were operating within carefully
prescribed parameters and they
had no interest in letting things
get out of hand.
Neither Tokyo nor Beijing has
released a full account of the New
York meeting, though the mere
fact it occurred raises hopes of
a peaceful solution to the crisis
between an ascendant China,
flush with tens of billions of dol-
lars of foreign exchange reserves
and a rapidly expanding military,
and a Japan that seems eager to
prove that despite long years of
economic drift it still remains a
power to be reckoned with.
China's official Xinhua News
Agency reported that Chinese
Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi
told Japanese counterpart Koi-
chiro Gemba that the Japanese
government's island purchase
constituted "a serious challenge
to the post-war international
order."

Court fastT tracks some
green card applications

Refs will be back
this weekend; offer
includes annual
pay increases
NEWYORK (AP)- The NFL
and the referees' union reached
a tentative contract agreement
at midnight Thursday, ending
an impasse that began in June
when the league locked out the
officials and used replacements
instead.
"Our officials will be back
on the field starting tomorrow
night" for the Cleveland-Bal-
timore game, Commissioner
Roger Goodell said. "We appre-
ciate the commitment of the
NFLRA in working through
the issues to reach this impor-
tant agreement."
With Goodell at the table,
the sides concluded two days
of talks with the announce-
ment of a tentative 8-year deal,
which must be ratified by 51
percent of the union's 121 mem-
bers. They plan to vote Friday.
"Our Board of Directors has
unanimously approved taking
this proposed CBA to the mem-
bership for a ratification vote,"
said Scott Green, president of
the NFLRA. "We are glad to
be getting back on the field for
this week's games."
The replacements worked
the first three weeks of games,
triggering a wave of frustra-
tion that threatened to disrupt
the rest of the season. After
a missed call cost the Green
Bay Packers a win on a chaotic
final play at Seattle on Monday
night, the two sides really got
serious.
The union was seeking
improved salaries, retirement
benefits and other logistical

issues for the part-time offi-
cials. The NFL has proposed
a pension freeze and a higher
401(k) match, and it wants
to hire 21 more officials to
improve the quality of officiat-
ing. The union has fought that,
fearing it could lead to a loss
of jobs for some of the current
officials, as well as a reduction
in overall compensation.
The NFL claimed its offers
have included annual pay
increases that could earn an
experienced official more than
$200,000 annually by .2018.
The NFLRA has disputed the
value of the proposal, insisting
it means an overall reduction
in compensation.
Replacement refs aren't new
to the NFL. They worked the
first week of games in 2001
before a deal was reached. But
those officials came from the
highest level of college foot-
ball; the current replacements
do not. Their ability to call
fast-moving NFL games drew
mounting criticism through
Week 3, climaxing last week-
end, when ESPN analyst Jon
Gruden called their, work
"tragic and comical."
Those comments came dur-
ing Monday Night Football,
with Seattle beating Green Bay
14-12 on a desperation pass into
the end zone on the final play.
Packers safety M.D. Jennings
had both hands on the ball in
the end zone, and when he fell
to the ground in a scrum, both
Jennings and Seahawks receiv-
er Golden Tate had their arms
on the ball.
The closest official to the
play, at the back of the end
zone, signaled for the clock to
stop, while another official at
the sideline ran in and then sig-
naled touchdown.

officials must give priority sta-
tus to thousands of green card
applicants who lost their place
in line for U.S. residency when
they turned 21.
A narrowly divided 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said
the United States Citizen and
Immigration Services wrongly
determined the applicants were
no longer eligible for special
visas as children of green card
holders after they turned 21.
The immigration service
said those children who "aged
out" during the process lost
their place in line, even if the
parents' application took years
to process.
Under U.S. immigration law,
children 21 and older cannot
immigrate under their parents'
applications for green cards.

The court ruled 6-5 court
otherwise, saying the appli-
cants may keep their "priority
date" established when their
parents filed for a derivative
visa for their children.
The ruling held that Con-
gress meant to aid these appli-
cants with the 2002 passage of
the Child Status Protection Act.
The act meant to preserve the
original date of application of a
minor who turned 21 during the
pendency of the parents' appli-
cation, the court ruled.
"We conclude that the plain
language of the CSPA unam-
biguously grants automatic
conversion and priority date
retention to aged-out deriva-
tive beneficiaries," Judge Mary
Murguia wrote for the majority.
The court ruled that immi-
gration officials were wrongly
forcingmanyofthese applicants
to file new applications for resi-
dency, putting their application
at the bottom of the pile. The
new ruling requires immigra-
tion officials to consider the
original application date while
processing the application for
residency.
The opinion reversed a trial

court judge, who tossed out
a class-action 'lawsuit filed
by legal U.S. residents whose
children were removed from
residency consideration under
their application when they
turned 21.
"Tens of thousands of chil-
dren living in the U.S. or abroad
who have 'aged out' of the green
card process would reclaim
their place in line based on this
decision," said Carl Shuster-
man, one of the lawyers repre-
senting the applicants.
The federal government
could ask the U.S. Supreme
Court to review the matter.
A U.S. Department of Jus-
tice spokesperson couldn't be
reached after hours in Wash-
ington D.C.
Judge Milan Smith wrote
a dissenting opinion. Smith
called the 2002 law ambigu-
ous and said it's unclear what
Congress meant with its pas-
sage. Further, he said the new
class of applicants now eligible
for priority consideration will
likely bump other, more clear
applications of other seeking
residency further down the
line.

confidence in the
economy increasing

UC agrees to pay $1 million to settle
pepper-spray lawsuit after Occupy

Each protester to
receive $30,000 in
settlement
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
The University of California
has agreed to pay $1 million to
settle a lawsuit filed by dem-
onstrators who were pepper-
sprayed during an Occupy
protest at UC Davis last fall,
according to a preliminary set-
tlement filed Wednesday.
The Nov. 18; 2011, incident
prompted national outrage,
angry campus protests and
calls for the resignation of
Chancellor Linda Katehi after
online videos shot by witnesses
went viral.
Images of a police officer
casually spraying orange pep-
per-spray in the faces of non-
violent protesters became a
rallying symbol for the Occupy
Wall Street movement. The
demonstrators had been pro-
testing steep tuition hikes and
police brutality.
Under the proposed settle-
ment, UC would pay $30,000
to each of 21 plaintiffs named in
the complaint and an additional
$250,000 for their attorneys to
split.
Katehi, who has publicly
apologized for the incident,
would be required to issue a
formal written apology to each
of the plaintiffs, who are cur-
rent students or recent alumni.
If the $1 million settlement
is approved, total costs asso-
ciated with the incident could
exceed $2 million, according
to the Sacramento Bee news-
paper. Those expenses come
as UC faces the prospect of
deep budget tuts if Gov. Jerry

Brown's tax initiative fails in
November.
UC and plaintiffs repre-
sented by the American Civil
Liberties Union filed the pre-
liminary settlement in U.S.
District Court in Sacramento.
The agreement, which was
approved by the UC Board of
Regents in mid-September, is
subject to the approval of a fed-
eral judge, and parties have the
right to appeal.
The settlement also calls
for UC to set aside $100,000
to pay other individuals who
can prove they were arrested
or pepper-sprayed. The univer-
sity would give the ACLU up to
$20,000 for its work reviewing
free speech and protest policies
at UC Davis.
"It was felt that the proposed
settlement was in the best
interest of the university," said
UC spokesman Steve Montiel.
UC officials believe the cost
of going to trial would be more
expensive than the cost of set-
tling the lawsuit, Montiel said.
Plaintiff Fatima Sbeih, who
recently graduated with an
international studies degree,
said she suffered panic attacks
and nightmares after she was
pepper-sprayed on the UC
Davis Quad.
"I want to make sure that
nothing like this happens
again," Sbeih said in a state-
ment. "The university still
needs to work to rebuild stu-
dents' trust and this settlement
is a step in the right direction."
A task force report released
in April blamed the incident on
poor communication and plan-
ning throughout the campus
chain of command, from the
chancellor to the pepper-spray-
ing officers, and concluded the

situation could have been pre-
vented.
"The settlement should be a
wake-up call for other univer-
sities and police departments,"
said Michael Risher, staff attor-
ney with the ACLU of Northern
California. "If the First Amend-
ment means anything, it's that
you should be able to demon-
strate without being afraid of
police violence."
Last week, Yolo County pros-
ecutors said the UC Davis offi-
cers who fired the pepper-spray
won't face criminal charges
because there is not enough
evidence to prove the use of
force was illegal.
John Pike, the campus police
lieutenant shown in the notori-
ous videos, was fired in July.
Annette Spicuzza, who oversaw
the campus police department
during the pepper-spray inci-
dent, resigned in April.
Documents obtained by the
Sacramento Bee through a Pub-
lic Records Act request indicate
UC has already spent more than
$1 million on expenses associ-
ated with the incident, includ-
ing:
- $320,000 for a law firm
for work on a UC review of how
campuses should respond to
protests.
- $88,686 for salaries and
other fees to UC Berkeley offi-
cials whoworked onthatreview.
- $119,714 for a firm to pro-
vide "real time crisis manage-
men support for UC Davis."
- $445,879 for a consulting
firm that investigated the inci-
dent for an independent task
force.
- $230,256 for an internal
affairs investigation into the
actions of one of the pepper-
spraying officers.

Hiring
expectations,
home values drive
rise
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Americans are more confi-
dent in the economy than they
have been in seven months, an
encouraging sign for President
Barack Obama with six weeks
left in the presidential race.
A new survey of consumer
confidence rose Tuesday to its
highest level since February on
expectations that hiring will
soon pick up. And a separate
report showed home values ris4
ing steadily, signaling sustained
improvement in housing.
"This is like an opinion poll
on the economy without the
political parties attached," said
John Ryding, chief economist
at RDQ Economics, a consult-
ing firm. The confidence survey
"says people are feeling better.
If so, they are less likely to vote
for change."
The Conference Board's
index of consumer confidence
shot up in September. The jump
surprised many economists
because the most recent hir-
ing and retail sales figures have
been sluggish.
The increased confidence
could help explain recent polls
that show Obama with a widen-
ing lead over Mitt Romney in
some battleground states.
The consumer confidence
index is closely watched
because consumer spending
drives nearly 70 percent of
economic activity. The index
jumped from 61.3 for August to
70.3 for September. It remains
well below 90, the level that
is thought to signify a healthy
economy.
Among those feeling more
optimistic about the economy
is Darlene Johnson of Silver
Spring, Md., who works for the
National Institutes of Health.
The value of Johnson's 401(k)

account has risen. Home sales
in her neighborhood have
ticked up, too, and are com-
manding higher prices.
"I feel like things are stabi-
lizing," she said. "I don't feel
as uneasy as I did a few months
ago."
But Johnson, who voted for
Obama in 2008, remains unde-
cided on which candidate to
back. And she's still a bit ner-
vous about the future.
"It will depend on how my
pockets are looking," she says.
"Everyday circumstances will
drive my decision on how I am
going to vote."
Economists point to some
key reasons why consumers
have grown more confident.
Stocks are up: The Standard
& Poor's 500 stock index has
surged nearly 15 percent this
year. Gas prices have leveled off
after rising for several months.
And the broad increase in home
prices is likely giving would-be
buyers more confidence. When
prices rise, buyers don't worry
so much that a home might lose
value after they bought it.
National home prices rose 1.2
percent in July compared with
a year ago, according to the
Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller
index released Tuesday. That
was the second straight month
in which year-over-year home
prices have increased.
Some economists question
whether the higher level of con-
fidence is sustainable. They've
seen the index spike briefly
before since the Great Reces-
sion ended more than three
years ago. Some say confidence
could be affected by negative
campaign ads that focus on the
economy.
But others note that even a
weak economy doesn't feel so
bad to many consumers once it
begins to make steady improve-
ment.
"The economy is perceived
in relative rather than absolute
terms," noted St. Louis Univer-
sity political scientist and poll-
ster Ken Warren.

Jumping the gun
Colorado should repeal concealed weapon ruling
n March, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the Univer-
sity of Colorado must allow students to carry registered guns
on their college campuses. Advocates of the ruling claim cam-
puses will be safer if students can defend themselves. However, the
beliefs in fighting violence with violence and that students should
resort to guns are incredibly misguided. Colorado and other states
need to repeal laws permitting concealed weapons at colleges and
reject this example, while deeply discouraging weapons on campus.

Fun damentally different

Gun violence made headlines again this
summer during the theater shooting in Auro-
ra, Col., as did the Columbine school shooting
that occurred 13 years earlier. With students
now allowed to carry concealed weapons,
many Colorado officials hope this new law
will make everyday life safer. But permitting
students to have guns on college campuses
does not prevent attacks. This law potentially
lessens the obstacles preventing those wish-
ing to do harm from bringing guns to large
gatherings of people - classrooms, dining
halls and auditoriums.
College students are not police officers, nor
do they have extensive experience with fire-
arms. From 2007 to 2011, there were approxi-
mately 300 deaths caused by concealed gun
carriers. The average civilian does not know
how or when to properly use a gun, and when
the inexperienced are permitted to carry guns,
it increases the risk of harm for bystanders in
violent situations. Universities do not have the
resources to control the use of guns on cam-
pus. Although the University of Colorado has

restricted gun holders to off-campus housing,
if students wish to use a gun, the university
will have very little power to stop them given
the size of the student population.
At the University of Michigan, there is a
policy against carrying concealed weapons
on campus. The fear is that this law may be
repealed. Gov. Rick Snyder is not quiet in his
support of gun owners, saying in an interview,
"We have a long tradition in our state of sup-
porting gun rights...and I would continue to
support that tradition as Governor." However,
gun rights should not get in the way of creating
a safe learning environment for students.
The Second Amendment stands for the right
to bear arms, but when it comes to educational
institutions, there should be laws restricting
concealed weapons for the safety of the stu-
dents. School shootings are a deep concern
but there are many other methods to prevent
violence than promoting self-defense with
firearms. Police alone are trained to safely deal
with issues of violence. They should not allow
the students to shoulder that responsibility.

B OWLING GREEN, OHIO
- It's not hard to figure out
that we live in an increas-
ingly polarized
country. From
energy policy
to how we tax
citizens, Romney
and Obama can't
agree on much.
At his rally on
Sept. 26 in Tole-
do, the phrase ADRIENNE
"my opponent" ROBERTS
was used in
more than a
few instances. Obama singled out
Republican presidential candidate
Mitt Romney several times, explain-
ing how Romney believes this or
plans to do that. Obviously partisan
and obviously effective.
But there was one statement
Obama made that may have shed
more light than he realized on the
fundamental difference between
today's Democrats and Republicans.'
"Here in America, we believe
we're in this thing together."
At first glance, that might seem
like an idea both parties would agree
with. But inaNew York Times article
published in early August, Firmin
DeBrabander, an associate professor
of philosophy at the Maryland Insti-
tute College of Art, Baltimore, argues
that Republicans hold onto the idea
of self-determination. Depending
on the government is unfathomable,
and a spirit of individualism always
prevails. One line in particular
stuck with me. "We are not the sole
authors of our destiny, each of us; our
destinies are entangled - messily, -
unpredictably." I think a substantial
percentage of our country would dis-
agree with that statement.
Trust in the federal government
always hovers somewhere around
60 percent. Most peoples' feelings
about our government - myself
included - aren't particularly favor-
able. So there's a tendency for many
to dismiss the government's role in

our lives. We can't survive in this
world without at least some govern-
mental assistance, but the penchant
of some to believe they can pull
themselves up by their own boot-
straps is almost admirable in a way.
And that same way of thinking
applies to the most recent Romney-
Obama spat. A week ago, at a forum
hosted by Univision, Obama said,
"The most important lesson I've
learned is you can't change Wash-
ington from the inside. You can
only change it from the outside."
Romney then turned Obama's
statement'into his rallying cry, and
at an event later the same day, he
changed his speech to say, "I can
change Washington, I will change
Washington. We'll get the job done
from the inside. Republicans and
Democrats will come together. He
can't do it."
Obama's response at today's
speech: "We have to change Wash-
ington from the outside, with the
help of ordinary Americans making
their voices heard."
That statement may seem like a
simple sound bite from a pandering
politician, but I think it reflects a
fundamental difference in the way
most Republicans and Democrats
view themselves. Romney believes
it's the president's job, and the pres-
ident's job alone, to change Wash-
ington. Like many Republicans, he
hangs on to this outdated idea of
pure individualism and presidential
effectiveness.
Contrast this with Obama, who
openly admits he needs help. To
him, "ordinary Americans" include
everyone living in this country.
From young, debt-ridden college
students to wealthy Wall Street
bankers, changing Washington
is a process everyone needs to
work toward. Every person affects
another somehow. For example,
the Affordable Care Act may be
Obama's way of helping those who
have pre-existing conditions get
insurance, and they, in turn, can

make their voices heard and par-
ticipate to make our government
change for the better.

Coping with competition

4
In his speech, Obama vowed to
never turn Medicare into a voucher
program, to create more manu-
facturing jobs in America and to
reduce the deficit by calling on
those making more than $250,000 a
year to pay a greater share of taxes.
These are basic principles of
today's Democratic party, but they
reflect completely different val-
ues as well. Obama fully acknowl-
edges that his role as president
doesn't necessarily mean he's solely
responsible for changing Washing-
ton into what we want it to be. This
sentiment was clearly reflected in
his speech today.
Romney and the Republican par-
ty's individualistic goals are admi-
rable. It's a way for me and other
people disillusioned with politics
to see the current Republican party
in a more favorable light. But this
"bootstrap" quality is simply unre-
alistic for today's world. We need
every citizen's political participa-
tion to influence the policies that
help us pay off our loans, buy houses
and receive medical treatment. We
shouldn't have to face this. world
alone, especially in today's econom-
ic state. President Obama gets this.
Romney, however, is still stuck in
a mindset that doesn't apply to the
problems we face today.

Graduating from a high school class of
only 40 students, I looked forward to
Michigan for more reasons than the
welcome change of a new
student body and a famous
football program - I was
excited to begin a new
phase of my life where
constant comparisons and
competitions for grades
would be absent.
With more than 26,000
undergraduate students SARAH
at the University, many ROHAN
unknown to one another,
I assumed that comparing
the decimal points of a grade after every test
would be a thing of the past. And, for the most
part, that assumption has proven true. How-
ever, I've noticed a different type of competi-
tive practice emerging in college - one that
feels more threatening than the battle for
grades I experienced at a competitive high
school. This competition is that of the pres-
tige of achievement.4
Let me provide an example which illus-
trates what I mean by prestige of achieve-
ment. Before starting college, I had little
interest in studying business. However, when
I noticed that many of my classmates were
applying to the Ross School of Business, I
briefly believed that I, too, should apply. After
all, it's a competitive program and it seemed
that admission would validate my intellect.
In other words, my brief desire to be in the
Business School was ignited by the prestige I
thought the program would afford me.
Of course, there's nothing wrong with
studying business or any other competitive
major. What's troubling is that the impetus to
do so is often the result of the race for recog-
nition.
The prestige of achievement isn't strictly
limited to areas of concentration. It also applies'
to internships, job opportunities, study abroad
programs and even extracurricular activities.
A pre-med student who spent her summer
shadowing a doctor feels threatened by the
classmate who spent his summer doingmedical
research at a university. An art major who stud-
ied abroad in Florence feels inadequate next to
her friend, a history major, who studied abroad
at Oxford. A writer for The Michigan Daily
feels like a joke compared to the kid in lecture
who's been published in a national paper. We've
all been there.
The idea of making choices based on prestige
is not a new one - many of us took into account
a school's reputation when applying to college.
However, its pervasiveness in the university
world is unique to our generation and due to a
few different factors.
One contributing factor to the stressful
trend is social media, a frequently cited and

often guilty culprit of our time. Never before
have we been so aware of our friends' profes-
sional achievements.
Networking tools like LinkedIn allow us
to see another's resume instantaneously.
Facebook allows us to see the enviable sum-
mer job or research opportunity that our best
friend's cousin just locked down. It's right
there on our homepage.
When comparing
GPAs gets old,
students find new
ways to compete.
Unfortunately, many of us forget that peo-
ple never publish a failure on their resumes
or Facebook profiles. All we see through oth-
ers' successes are the opportunities we never
had and the prestigious awards we never won.
The competition of prestige belittles our own
accomplishments (no matter how great), makes
us second-guess our choices and breeds fear for
our futures.
The feeble job market also accounts for
our widespread preoccupation with others'
achievements. When we hear of a friend getting
a new job, many of us feel a pang of jealousy or
alarm at our ownunstable futures - there goes
the job we could've had.
Needless to say, the air of prestige-based
competitiveness doesn't make for a bet-
ter academic environment. Not only does it
diminish one's self-esteem, it inhibits our
ability to be happy about our peers' achieve-
ments. We must resist the urge to use other
students as a yardstick for measuring our
own accomplishments.
I didn't consider the Business School just
because I viewed it as prestigious. I'm an
English major, for God's sake! I considered
it because everyone else held it in such high
regard. The student who shadowed a doctor
probably doesn't want to work in a lab, but she
still feels bad about it since others seem to value
lab research more highly.
In moments of doubt, we surrender to ideas
of prestige that we don't personally hold.
This game of comparison is bound to leave us
all dissatisfied - even when we're doing what
we want, it makes us feel like we should be
doing something else. It's important, there-
fore, to strive for achievements which make
us proud and avoid succumbing to the tempt-
ing comparisons our environment creates.

Political participation is our duty

Waking up one morning, you
begin the arduous process of mak-
ing that first cup of coffee, throw-
ing together some semblance of
an outfit and then you look at your
phone and see the headline "United
States Reinstates Draft." The real-
ization dawns upon you that, even
though you didn't vote, you have
the possibility of getting drafted.
This is an extreme example of the
inevitable if voter apathy amongthe
youth continues.
We've all heard the objections to
voting. One is that as a result of Con-
gress'extreme platforms, many peo-
ple feel alienated because they don't
support the views of either of the
parties. Unfortunately, what's mis-
understood by these individuals is
that if they do not demonstrate their
views through active suffrage, their
opinions will continue to be ignored.
It's understood that the main goal of
political parties is to win elections.
Accordingly, they have nothing to
gain by appealing to the views of
people who will not help them win
these elections. By excluding them-
selves from the voting process,
youth are confirming the long-held
belief of political organizations that
they aren't worth including in the

political process.
A second objection to voting is
that a portion of the population still
believes their vote doesn't really
mean anything. This justification of
voter apathy is nothing but circular
logic. By choosing not to vote, you're
wasting your ability to participate
in the political process and, conse-
quently, are making your opinion
meaningless. This, however, isn't
the full extent of the issue. Not only
are you making your own opinion
less valuable, you are decreasing the
chance that the opinions of others in
yourdemographicwillbe addressed.
Nowhere is this more clearly reflect-
ed than in the youth vote. .
The third major objection to vot-
ing is that the government is system-
ically inactive by nature, and that
there's nothing anyone can do about
it. However, through representation,
the U.S. government is designed to
reflect the will and positions of its
people. If the government is inac-
tive, it's simply a reflection of the
will of the people. If people wanted
the government to be industrious,
they themselves would be tirelessly
involved in the political process.
The best method for expressing this
involvement is through suffrage.

Far-reaching measures must be
enacted in light of these precari-
ous circumstances. Many people
advocate voting as a civic duty that
everyone ought to exercise. While
this is a step in the right direction,
it's akin to a pile of well-meaning
sand attempting to hold back the
ever-rising tide of voter apathy.
Therefore, in order to influence
politics and make the youth voice a
force to be contended with, we must
extend what we view as a civic duty.
It's not enough to simply go and
vote. In order to remake the politi-
cal environment we must go above
and beyond the status quo. There-
fore, it's not only your civic respon-
sibility to vote, but your duty to go
out and persuade others to exer-
cise the same privilege. As John D.
Rockefeller, Jr. put it, "every right
implies a responsibility."
So, if your responsibility is to influ-
ence the political process through
your suffrage and your influence is
being restricted by voter apathy, you
have an obligation to motivate others.
This election season, it's not only the
right thing to educate others, but a
moral necessity.

Election fever
missing on many
college campuses

In this Nov. 22, 2011 photo, Google executive Fabio Jose Silva Coelho poses for a portrait in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Google Inc.'s head of operations in Brazil was detained
by the country's federal police on Wednesday after the company failed to heed a judge's order to take down YouTube videos that the court ruled were illegal.

Anti-Islam film on
YouTube deemed
a violation of
Brazilian law
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -
Google Inc.'s head of operations
in Brazil was detained by the
country's federal police Wednes-
day after the company failed to
heed a judge's order to take down
YouTube videos that the court
ruled violate Brazilian electoral
law.
The detention came as another
court ordered YouTube to remove
clips of an anti-Islam film that has
been blamed for deadly protests
by Muslims around the globe,
both joining a spate of court-
ordered content-removal cases
against Google's video-sharing
website in Brazil.,
The arrest of Google execu-
tive Fabio Jose Silva Coelho was
announced in Sao Paulo. A press
release issued by the federal
police said he was not expected
to remain in jail and should be
released later in the day after
signing a document promising to
appear in court.
Brazil's strict electoral laws
limit what critics can say on
television, radio and the Inter-
net about candidates for office.
Ahead of municipal elections
next month, Google has received
repeated requests to remove Web
videos that allegedly violate those
restrictions.
A judge in Mato Grosso do
Sul state ordered Coelho's arrest
Tuesday because the company
had not removed YouTube videos
that make incendiary comments

about an alleged paternity suit
aimed at Alcides Bernal, who is
running for mayor of the city of
Campo Grande. That ruling also
included a statewide, 24-hour
suspension of Google and You-
Tube. It was not immediately
clear if and how that aspect of the
ruling mightbe carried out.
Google said Tuesday that
it was appealing the decision.
"Being a platform, Google is not
responsible for the content posted
on its site," the company said in
an emailed statement from Sao
Paulo.
A judge in the southern state
of Parana earlier ordered Google
to pay $500,000 for each day that
it balked at fulfilling an order to
remove other videos criticizing
a candidate. In the northeastern
state of Paraiba, a judge ordered
the imprisonment of another
Google executive in Brazil, also
for not removing videos from
YouTube attacking a mayoral
candidate, but that order was
overruled by a higher court.
Eva Galperin of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, which pro-
motes digital freedom, said the
rash of Brazilian cases was "dis-
appointing, but not surprising"
ahead of the country's nationwide
municipal elections on Oct. 7 and
Oct. 28.
"The Internet is global, but
laws are made nation by nation,"
she said. "There is a struggle
between nation states and their
laws and the freedom of expres-
sion policies of companies that
host content all over the globe."
In a separate case pending
against Google, Sao Paulo-based
judge Gilson Delgado Miranda
gave the site 10 days to remove
video clips from "Innocence of

Muslims," which has angered
many Muslims around the world
by its depiction of the Prophet
Mohammed and his followers as
thugs. After the 10-day window,
Google will face fines of $5,000 a
day for every day the clips remain
accessible in Brazil, according to
the statement on the court's web-
site.
The company did not respond
to requests Wednesday for com-
ment about the case.
The "Innocence of Muslims"
ruling resulted from a lawsuit
by a group representing Brazil's
Muslim community, the National
Union of Islamic Entities, which
claimed the film violates the coun-
try's constitutional guarantee of
religious freedom for all faiths.
In a statement on the group's
website, Mohamad al Bukai, the
head of religious matters for the
Sao Paulo-based organization,
hailed the ruling.
"Freedom of expression must
not be confused with giving dis-
proportionate and irresponsible
offense, which can provoke seri-
ous consequences for society,".al
Bukai said.
Dozens of people have been
killed in violence linked to pro-
tests over "Innocence of Mus-
lims," which portrays the Prophet
Muhammad as a fraud, a woman-
izer and a child molester.
Attempts by courts and offi-
cials in several countries to
remove the clips have revived the
debate over freedom of expres-
sion.
The judge in the Brazilian
case acknowledged that banning
content from sites like YouTube
is a thorny issue, according to
excerpts of the ruling cited in the
National Union of Islamic Enti-

ties' statement.
"This type of jurisprudence
cannot be confused with censor-
ship," Miranda is quoted as writ-
ing. In the excerpts, the judge
defines censorship as "the undue
restriction of the civic conscious-
ness."
YouTube routinely blocks
video in specific countries if
it violates laws there. It also
removesvideo deemed to infringe
copyrights, show pornography,
contain hate speech or violate
other guidelines. However, none
of those restrictions had been
applied in Brazil to the "Inno-
cence of Muslims."
Google is now selectively
blocking the video clips in coun-
tries that include Libya and
Egypt. Google has said it made
the decision to block the video in
such places due to "the sensitive
situations" there.
Galperin of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation questioned
whether a ban was really neces-
sary in Brazil, which has seen
no protests or rioting that have
swept the Muslim world in recent
weeks.
"The notion that there's a need
to take it down to prevent vio-
lence is ludicrous," she said.
Miranda's ruling came on the
same day that Brazilian President
Dilma Rousseff addressed the
United Nations and urged an end
to prejudice against Muslims.
. Google has said it has been so
inundated by requests from gov-
ernments worldwide to remove
online content that it has begun
releasing a summary of the
demands, most relating to legiti-
mate attempts to enforce laws on
issues ranging from personal pri-
vacy to hate speech.

Four years ago,
youth enthusiasm
was overwhelming
ELMHURST, Ill. (AP) -
What a difference four years
can make.
In 2008, college campuses
were filled with campaign
posters and political ral-
lies - and frenzy. Remember
"Obamamania?" This year, it's
difficult to find a college stu-
dent who's truly excited about
the presidential race.
"Politics has gone back
to that thing you don't want
to bring up," says Abraham
Mulberry. He's a freshman at
Elmhurst College in suburban
Chicago who's trying to start a
club for young Democrats.
Last election, his campus
had an active Students for
Obama chapter, organized well
before the election. But this
time, there's nary a campaign
placard, for either President
Barack Obama or Republican
candidate Mitt Romney.
"I wouldn't say the election
is the No. 1 hot-button issue
here," Mulberry says, disap-
pointedly.
Granted, you don't see many
signs of campaign enthusiasm
in the neighborhoods that
surround his campus, or else-
where for that matter. But it's
telling that, on many college
campuses across the coun-
try - where, in 2008, then-
candidate Obama's messages
of "hope" and "change" easily
took hold - the mood is mark-
edly more subdued.
"Certainly, some (young
people) have stopped believ-
ing," says Molly Andolina, a
political scientist at DePaul
University in Chicago who
tracks young voters. "Maybe
that's inevitable. For structur-
al reasons, it's easier to offer
hope and change as a candidate,
than as a president.".
Excitement was so high, it
really had nowhere to go but
down, she says. This time,
there's also no obvious chance
to make history, as there was
when students helped elect the
country's first African-Ameri-
can president.
"For young voters, it was like
going to Woodstock in 1968,"
says John Della Volpe, the poll-
ing director at Harvard Univer-
sity's Institute of Politics.

Now like a lot of Americans,
they're more worried about
the economy and finding jobs.
Voter ID laws in some states,
which ban or restrict the use
of student IDs at the polls, also
are causing confusion on cam-
puses - at a time when stu-
dents are already weary and
cynical about political bicker-
ing in Washington.
"Lots of people thought
President Obama could go in
and break gridlock and that
didn't happen," says Ethan
Weber, a senior at Miami Uni-
versity in Ohio, who'll be grad-
uating in December. "That's
the scariest thing to a lot of
young people - that nothing is
going to happen."
In 2008, Weber cast a half-
hearted vote for Republican
John McCain, certain Obama
would win. This time, he's vot-
ing for Romney and sees the
election as a "toss-up."
He is still in the minor-
ity in the 18- to 29-year-old
age group, according to polls.
Young people are leaning
strongly Democratic, as they
traditionally do, and favor
Obama by a wide margin -
though some pollsters say the
youngest new voters are show-
ing signs that they may buck
that trend.
An Associated Press-GfK
poll conducted earlier this
month found that 61 percent
of registered voters in the
18-to-29 bracket support the
president, compared with 30
pefcent for Romney.
In 2008, young people
ended up voting for Obama by
a 2-to-1 margin, with just over
half of U.S. citizens, ages 18
to 29, casting a ballot in 2008.
Though older generations
are still more likely to vote -
about two-thirds of citizens
older than 30 did so in 2008,
for instance - youth turnout
was larger than it had been
in recent years, and was par-
ticularly notable because their
wide margin of support helped
lift Obama into office.
It remains to be seen, how-
ever, whether they'll show up at
the polls this time.
A Gallup poll taken Aug.
27-Sept. 16 found that 63 per-
cent of registered voters, ages
18 to 29, said they "definitely"
plan to vote. That Compares
with at least 80 percent of
registered voters in older age
brackets who said the same.

Saudi Arabian government detains 908 female
Nigerian pilgrims en route to Mecca on lajj

Rule requiring
husband to travel
with women causes
deportation threats
ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) - The
detention of hundreds of female
Nigerian pilgrims heading to
Mecca at Saudi Arabia's busi-
est airport over a rule requiring
them to travel with a husband
or male relative is threatening
to bring a diplomatic dispute
between the two nations.
Saudi authorities are hold-
ing 908 Nigerian women in poor
conditions "with some needing
urgent medical attention" at King
Abdulaziz Airport in Jeddah and
threatened to deport them, the
National Hajj Commission of
Nigeria said in a report submitted
to Nigerian lawmakers Wednes-
day.
The report said female pil-
grims who had landed in a small-
er airport in Medina had been
unaffected.
However, Fuwaiba Muham-
mad, a pilgrim, told an Associ-

ated Press reporter at Mallam
Aminu Kano International Air-
port in the northern Nigerian
city of Kano that she had been
deported Wednesday from the
Saudi Arabian city of Medina,
along with dozens of others.
Uba Mana, a spokesman for
the National Hajj Commission,
said no pilgrim had been deport-
ed by Saudi authorities yet, but
that the commission had asked
for female pilgrims who did not
meet the Saudi immigration offi-
cials' requirements to temporar-
ily be brought back to Nigeria to
avoid deportations.
"Medina is a small airport,"
Mana said, "and if we allow peo-
ple to get deported from there,
the pilgrims won't be able to
return to Saudi Arabia for anoth-
er five years, and by no fault of
their own," he said.
This is the first time pilgrims
have faced the possibility of mass
deportation over the male escort
issue, the commission has said.
Accordingto the report, an agree-
ment between Saudi Arabia and
Nigeria exempts female pilgrims
from requiring a male relative
to escort them for the manda-

tory Hajj pilgrimage, which costs
about $4,000 per person.
Until now, state pilgrimage
officials had been allowed to
stand in the place of a male rela-
tive or husband. Muhammad, for
instance, said that she had been
fraveling with a Hajj official who
is not her relative.
But Saudi authorities have
proven much stricter this year.
They even stopped women who
did travel with their husbands.
"Islam allows wives to bear
the names of their parents and
not necessarily that of their hus-
bands," the report argued.
All able-bodied Muslims who
can afford it are expected to per-
form Hajj at least once in their
lives, leading people to go to
great lengths to make the trip.
Some pilgrims sell their cows
and jewelry and others save for
months or years to pay their own
way to Mecca. Muslim philan-
thropists and politicians in Nige-
ria will typically sponsor some
pilgrims annually.
Mana had said Monday that
the escort situation had been
resolved through diplomatic
channels, but the commission's

report Wednesday said Saudi
authorities have "remained ada-
mant."
The report said top Nigerian
officials had held meetings with
Saudi officials in Nigeria and in
Saudi Arabia in a bid to come to
reach a compromise.
Nigeria's Foreign Ministry
sent a letter of undertaking guar-
anteeing the return of the female
pilgrims after Hajj, it added, but
Saudi authorities still did not
release them.
Nigerian President Goodluck
Jonathan put together a high-
profile delegation late Wednes-
day to travel to Saudi Arabia "as
soon as an appointment is final-
ized with the appropriate author-
ity," a government statement
said.
Saudiofficials couldnotimme-
diately be reached for comment
Wednesday.
Nigeria, a nation of more than
160 million people evenly divided
between Muslims and Chris-
tians, and Saudi Arabia are both
members of the Organization of
Islamic Cooperation, an umbrel-
la organization representing 57
Muslim nations.

Hopes to break
32-state losing
streak in upcoming
election
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - In
one TV ad, a husband and wife
talk fondly of a lesbian couple
who moved into their neigh-
borhood. In another, a mar-
ried couple speaks of wanting
fair treatment for their lesbian
daughter. A third features a
pastor talking supportively
about gay unions.
Each of these ads ran recent-,
ly in states with gay marriage
issues on the November ballot.
What's missing? Gay people
speaking for themselves.
Four states are voting on
gay marriage this fall, and gay
rights groups are pouring tens
of millions of dollars into key
TV markets in hopes of break-
ing a 32-state losing streak on
the issue. But even as gay peo-
ple and same-sex relationships
gain acceptance through pop
culture staples such as "Mod-
ern Family" and "Glee," the idea
is still seen as dicey by media
strategists involved in the ballot
campaigns, resulting in ads that
usually involve only straight
people talking about the issue.

The decision to keep gays in
the background has been wide-
ly noticed in the gay communi-
ty and debated on gay-oriented
blogs, with some activists com-
plaining that the move contra-
dicts the central message of
the gay rights movement for a
number of years.
"If we don't show ourselves,
people aren't going to get com-
fortable with who we are,"
said Wayne Besen, director
of Vermont-based gay rights
group "Truth Wins Out," one
of many that presses gays to
live openly with pride in who
they are.
But others counsel defer-
ence for the complexities of
public messaging, pointing
out that the ads are designed
to speak to the fears and val-
ues of the heterosexual major-
ity, whose vote will decide the
issue.
"The moderate tough guys
we need to flip to win a cou-
ple of these races are still the
ones who say that gays are
gross," said Andy Szekeres,
a Denver-based fundraising
consultant who has worked on
several state campaigns and
had access to focus group data.
"Pushing people to an uncom-
fortable place, it's something
you can't do in a TV ad," said
Szekeres, who is gay

a drop in National Institutes of
Health funding that was support-
ed by stimulus funds. The NIH
is currently the single largest
funder of University research.
According to the most recent
National Science Foundation
report, published in 2009, the
University ranks first in research
expenditures among public uni-
versities and number two out
of national universities, behind
Johns Hopkins University in Bal-
timore, Md., which has a research
budget approaching $2 billion.
Encompassed by the recent
increase is a more than $20 mil-
lion contract for the University's
Transportation Research Insti-

tute to study connected vehicle
technology, which allows vehi-
cles to gather information about
road conditions and other perti-
nent information while traveling.
The technology, which is funded
by the U.S. Department of Trans-
portation, could alert a driver
about possible accidents, changes
in weather conditions and traffic
patterns.
This new technology could be
utilized in about 10 percent of car
crashes that occur between non-
impaired motorists, according to
the DOT.
Forrest said he expects federal
research budgets to remain flat
or decrease slightly over the next
few years..
"I fully anticipate that the
University of Michigan will
maintain its leadership role as

one of the premier research
institutions in the world," he
said. "We're always looking to
the areas where we are unques-
tionably the best or have a really
good shot at being the best ... to
take leadership and to really
drive the overall success of the
University forward."
Forrest said the current eco-
nomic crisis may provide the
University with an opportunity
to differentiate itself from other
institutions.
"These are really challenging
times and this is when the Uni-
versity of Michigan has a really
good opportunity to excel, to
seek advantage," he said. "When
everyone is hunkering down ...
we should be the most daring
... and be a value to the entire
nation and, of course, the world."

at Barwis Methods, a training
facility in Plymouth, Mich. that
attracts University athletes and
employees. At the Barwis Meth-
ods booth, Mozes, a former Min-
nesota Viking, and Cooke, who
played for the Baltimore Ravens,
Chicago Bears, and Detroit
Lions, advised fair-goers about
exercise, fitness and nutrition.
Another main attraction of
the event was the farmers mar-
ket, which sold an abundance of
seasonal fall produce - ranging
from Indian corn, to butternut
squash to apples - supplied by
Zilke Vegetable Farm in Milan
and Eat Ideas Farm in Ann
Arbor.

Lizz Wysocki, an employee
at Zilke Vegetable Farm, said
the market was lucky to feature
apples because of the shortage
that Michigan has faced this
year as a result of a warm winter
and frost in April.
"It's unfortunate," Wysocki
said. "We were lucky to find an
(orchard) which had some. The
late frost that we had just really
kicked everything."
The fair also included a live
cooking demo from the Picasso
Restaurant group, a local res-
taurant and catering service that
showcased how to make gazpa-
cho using fresh, seasonal veg-
etables. Other booths showcased
various campus organizations,
such as Outdoor Adventures.
Local Ann Arbor organizations
also attended, including a group

from the Matthaei Botanical
Garden and Nichols Arboretum.
University students, fac-
ulty and staff trekked through
the fair, browsing booths and
indulging in free giveaways.
Fang Tan, a Law School pro-
fessor, said her curiosity about
health-oriented opportunities
on campus drew her to the fair.
"I just wanted to see what was
going on, to see what they were
offering here, (and I wanted)
more information," Tan said.
Law student Iman Abdulraz-
zak said she was lured by the
unusual location of the fair in a
typically academic area of cam-
pus.
"I actually thought it was nice
they were doing something like'
this in the Law School." Abdul-
razzak said.

OHIO
From Page 1A
Press.
Electoral history and experts
suggest that the campaigns'
emphasis on Ohio is warranted.
Since John F. Kennedy lost the
state in the 1960 presidential elec-
tion, no one has been elected pres-
ident of the United States without
winning Ohio's electoral votes.
Obama leads Romney in Ohio 53
to 43 percent in a poll released by
Quinnipac University yesterday in
conjunction with CBS News and
The New York Times.
Issues that Obama has touted
as successes, including the rebirth
of the auto industry, have proved
important to voters here. Accord-
ing to NBC, 57 percent of Ohioans
who might vote said they didn't
think Romney cared about their
needs, and 51 percent thought
Obama could better handle the
economy.
Michael- Heaney, an assistant
professor of political science,
called the state a "linohpin" for
Romney, emphasizing that he
needs to win the state in order to
win the presidency. He added that
while the state is still important
for Obama he could win the elec-
tion with a coalition of electoral
votes from other states such as
Virginia, Iowa and Colorado in
place of Ohio.
"There are multiple paths for
(Obama) to win the election, and
those paths may or may not include
Ohio," Heaney said. "For Obama,
Ohio is one of the states that could
put him over the top, whereas for
Mitt Romney, it's really hard to

see how he could win the election
without winning Ohio."
Heaney noted that of all the
swing states, Ohio offers the sec-
ond most electoral votes at 18,
behind Florida with 29.
Not only does Ohio serve as
a substantial boost in the total
electoral count for a president, it
is a "bellwether state" that tends
to reliably reflect the rest of the
undecided sectors of the nation,
Heany said.
"Ohio is the state that is most
likely to make a difference in the
election. If there's going to be
one state that swings the election
from one candidate to another, it's
going to be Ohio," Heaney said. "It
reflects the trend in the nation."
Heaney said one explanation
for Obama's lead in Ohio may be
that the state's economic recovery
has been slightly better than the
national average.
Ohio's unemployment rate was
reported at 7.2 percent in August,
the lowest unemployment rate
in the state since 2008. The AP
reported that Ohio's unemploy-
ment rate has steadily remained
1-percent less than the national
rate, and the number of unem-
ployed residents in Ohio decreased
by 5,000 from July to August.
Political Science Prof. John
Chamberlin said Ohio will contin-
ue to receive national mediasatten-
tion and become a state indicative
of who will win the election.
"Republicans are not runtning
ads in Michigan and Pennsylva-
nia so they can throw money into
Ohio," Chamberlin said. "It is
going to be one of the places that
absorb a huge amount ofcampaign
money and time. People will be

polling like crazy in Ohio and we'll
start to see those results in the
next ten days."
Though they didn't campaign
together in Toledo, Romney and
his running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul
Ryan (R-Wisc.) have held other
rallies together this week, sug-
gesting that Republicans have
realized they need to double their
effort in Ohio, Political Science
Prof. Michael Traugott said.
"We can tell generally in acam-
paign about the importance of a
particular state by how much the
candidates spend on advertising,
how much of their personal time
they spend there, and the signifi-
cance of Ohio is much more impor-
tant for Romney and that's why
both he and Paul Ryan are cam-
paigning there," Traugott said.
Traugott said Romney is
already facing a tougher chal-
lenge, because polling suggests
Ohio seems to prefer Obama's
policies.
"For Romney, it's a more dif-
ficult task because his standard
advertising message doesn't seem
to be very influential for the voters
in Ohio," Traugott said. "In addi-
tion to the personal appearances
that he makes, he's going to have
to revise his message somehow."
When the polls open on Elec-
tion Day on Nov. 6, up to 40 per-
cent of the country will have
already voted, according to CNN.
Ohio begins its early voting pro-
cess - in which certain states
allow in-person or mail-in voting
before Nov. 6 - on Oct. 2.
Obama campaign spokesman
Adam Fetcher told CNN that the
Obama campaign realizes the
potential benefit of getting people

to cast their votes early.
"While Mitt Romney and his
allies are counting on big ad buys
... we've made earlyinvestments in
battlegroundstates - where we've,
been registering folks and keeping
an open conversation going with
undecided voters for months - to
build a historic grassroots organi-
zation that will pay off when the
votes are counted," Fetcher said.
In their visits yesterday, both
candidates said the electoral bat-
tle for Ohio could them win the
political war for America's future.
Speaking to a crowd at the
SeaGate Convention Centre in
Toldeo, Romney said the policies
he would bring to the oval Office
are very different than Obama's.
Romney said he could save
voters from the pitfalls of anoth-
er four years under the Obama
administration. Speaking in Lucas
County - where NBC reports 18
percent of the population lives
below the poverty level, and a
median household income is about
$42,000 - Romney said he would
address the economic despair of
the middle class if elected.
"Do you want four more years,
where half our kids coming out
of college can't find a college level
job? Do you want four more years
of trillion dollar deficits?" Romney
asked. "If President Obama were
to be re-elected, what we'd see is
four more years like the last four
years, and we can't afford another
four more years."
Romney said his policy plat-
forms will lead America down a
more prosperous path and gener-
ate much-needed change for the
nation.
"I will take America in a very

different direction than this presi-
dent,' Romney said. "This election
comes down to a choice. It comes
down to a choice of path. His
campaign slogan is "forward" -
forward with the same ideas, the
same approach as he's had the last
four years."
Earlier in the day iri a raucous
rally here, Obama said he too rec-
ognized very different realities
for America's future depending
on which candidate is chosen in
November.
During Wednesday's speech at
BGSU, Obama said that because
of personal experience he deeply
valued higher education.
"Education was my gateway to
opportunity," Obama said. "That's
the only reason I'm standing here.
It's the path more than ever to a
middle-class life.
Caitlyn Fuller, a senior at BGSU
and a life-long resident of Bowling
Green, said she came to the event
to support the President, who she
finds to be more relatable than
Romney.
"He's just really, really wealthy,
and I'm notsure how in touch he is
with Ohio,"'Fuller said.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily following the president's
speech yesterday, White House
Press Secretary Jay Carney said
Obama's visit to Ohio shows his
commitment to working families.
"The President is committed to
the people taking these auto bail-
outs," Carney said.
Speaking to the crowd at BGSU,
Obama said he was proud of
defending the auto industry, an
effort he said his opponent chid-
ed, alluding to a 2008 New York
Times Op-ed written by Romney
titled "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."
"When my opponent just said
we should, 'Let Detroit go bank-
rupt,' that would have meant

walking away from an industry
that supports one in eight Ohio
jobs," Obama said.
Obama said he already had the
country heading in the right direc-
tion - forward, like his campaign
slogan.
"Today, the American auto
industry has come roaring back
with nearly 250,000 new jobs,"
Obama said. "Now you've got
a choice. We can give more tax
breaks to companies that are ship-
ping jobs overseas or we can start
rewarding companies for open-
ing new plants and training new
workers and creating jobs right
here in the United States."
Obama said that unlike Rom-
ney, he would be a president for
all, citing the recent exposure of a
speech made by Romney to donors
in May that claimed 47 percent
of Americans are dependent on
the federal government and view
themselves to be victim.
"I don't believe we can get very
far with leaders who write off half
the nation as a bunch of victims
who never take responsibility for
their own lives," Obama said. "As
I drive around Ohio and as I look
around, I don't see a bunch of vic-
tims, I see hard-working Ohio-
ans."
In Toledo, Romney admitted
Obama cares, but said the presi-
dent's good intentions are mis-
placed.
"Look, I know the President
cares about America, the people
of this country," Romney said.
"He just doesn't know how to help
them. I do."

Fuller said she believes the

about a college education as a

"We need a president who is

Seth Melchor, a BGSU senior
who has volunteered for the
Obama campaign since 2008
and introduced the president
before his remarks, said he
believes Obama resonates with
Americans in a way Romney
can't.
"You'll notice that the way
that he connects with average
Americans, we haven't seen in
generations, it's truly unique,"
Melchor said. "The fact that he's
interested in connecting with
each and every person ... He
brought my entire family back
and signed stuff for us and he
gave my grandma a kiss on the
cheek. (She) just about passed
out she was so excited."
Melchor said Obama is clearly
the strong candidate, noting
how Romney's "victims" com-
ment has alienated a substantial
portion of the population.
"I don't pay income tax
because I'm a college student.
I don't think the government
owes me anything, I'm not a vic-
tim, I just don't make enough
money to do it yet," Melchor
said. "When I will eventually,
I have no problem doing that, I
think that we have to support
those that aren't yet in a position
to succeed, and the president is
absolutely willing to do that as
opposed to someone who wants
to ignore half our nation."

Professional artists worked with

Box was considered the chief

that the homemade mixture

than spray-paint or spray chalk

While the group was forced
to re-paint an entire mile and a

was inspired by the event and
thought it was a great success.
"It took so much more effort,

By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
TOLEDO, Ohio - Enthusias-
tically reaching out to voters in
one of the election's most cru-
cial states, Republican presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney
spoke in front of a packed audi-
torium at the SeaGate Conven-
tion Centre here on Wednesday
evening.
Romney focused on unem-
ployment and the national debt
during his address, continually
pointing to President Barack
Obama's failure to revive the
economy during the past four
years. A large poster reading
"We Can't Afford Four More
Years" and a digital national
debt clock served as a backdrop
to his speech.
"You see that clock up
there?" Romney said, gesturing
to the clock. "16 trillion dollars
in debt. When (Obam's) cam-
paign began it was a heck of a
lot less than that. When the
president was elected it was
about 10 point something. It's
not good for the economy, it's
not good for jobs, and in my
view I think it's amoral for us to
pass on obligations to our kids
of that nature."
His rhetoric was met with
strong encouragement from
the crowd, who frequently
drowned out his words with
cheering and clapping as they
waved their American flags,
pom-poms, and Romney-Ryan
2012 posters.
As part of his reassurance
that he will be an adept leader
to fix the economy, Romney
articulated his five step plan
for the economy, a measure he
argued will create 12 million
jobs. The first step of his plan
involves a movement toward
energy independence by taking
advantage of North American
SIKH

at the vigil emphasized that it
is important to honor the vic-
tims of the event and reflect on
overcoming cultural misunder-
standings.
Rackham student Anneeth
Hundle said it was important to
recognize the shooting, particu-
larly since many students were
not on campus at the time.
"It was a great and important
event to have because there are
so many Sikh students on cam-
pus," Hundle said. "The event
happened over the summer,
so people felt really alienated
about what happened and there
needed to be sort of some vis-
ibility surrounding the violence
that happened and the politics
that happened."
Arvind-Pal Mandair, an
Asian Languages and Culture
professor, was among numerous

another co-founder of Wedge,
explained that a key part of the
program was bringing out the
community's creativity, and
hosting an event for people to
enjoy the art.
"one of the good signs for me
was walking down the street
and seeing random people hop-
ping - kids and adults,", Box
said. "We saw one woman who
was eight months pregnant in
heels and hopping."
University alum Ajooni Sethi,
also a co-founder of Wedge, said
the project was also part of the
Detroit Design Festival, noting
that the particular type of com-
munity-based design work tran-
scends logos and websites and is
dedicated to city improvement.
Sethi said the program cre-
ates connections and opportu-
nities for recreation without
changing the physical attributes
of the sidewalk.
"That is the power of design,"
Sethi said. "It re-designs the way
we look at something to improve
and highlight the resources in
Detroit."
The world record was broken

natural gas, oil and coal.
"Prices at the pump have
doubled (during Obama's
term)," Romney said. "We're
going to have North American
energy independence within
eight years. That's going to hap-
pen"
The second part of his pro-
posed plan focuses on job
training and would give states
federal grants to set up their
own training programs. He
emphasized the importance
of education, noting that Mas-
sachusetts, where he served as
governor from 2003-2007, has
one of the nation's best educa-
tion systems.
In the third part of his plan,
Romney chided Obama's inter-
national economic relations,
emphasizing that if he is elect-
ed, he would give America the
upper hand in trade relations
with China. The fourth part
of his plan involved instilling
faith in job creators and entre-
preneurs by working toward
achieving a balanced budget,
and his fifth step detailed his
plan to invest his personal
attention to small business.
"We need to champion small
business ... small business is
where jobs come from." Rom-
ney said. "The president's plan,
by the way, you know what it is.
He plans on raising taxes. He's
already said he's going to raise
taxes on some one million small
businesses. I'm going to lower
the tax rates. I'm going to cre-
ate jobs, he'll kill them."
In an attempt to appeal to
middle and lower class voters
- in light of the recent release
of video of a speech to donors
last May where he claimed that
47 percent of the population is
dependent on the government
and believes they are victims -
Romney insisted that he would
be attentive to the needs of
struggling Americans.
"We have people that are
hurting. We have people that
are disabled. We have people
that are poor and need our help
and will receive our help. We're
a charitable people. No nation
on earth is as charitable as the
faculty members in attendance,
and said honoring the victims is
important not just in showing
respect for the Sikh community,
but for all groups affected by
violence.
"We think this is not just
something that affected Sikhs,"
Mandair said. "It is very much
affecting ethnic minorities at
large, but it's about America
itself. So we'd like to really
discuss this at a very serious
level."
LSA sophomore Courtney
Green said she was inspired to
attend the vigil after receiving
an e-mail about the event, and
enjoyed seeing support from a
variety of organizations repre-
senting different backgrounds.
"What makes it so great is
the diversity in this country
and the willingness of support-
ing each other no matter what
our background is," Green said.

people of the United States of
America ... We're a compassion-
ate people." Romney said.
Romney also emphasized his
belief that Obama's health care
plan has been detrimental to
job growth and small business
prosperity, citing a survey in
which allegedly three-quar-
ters of small business owners
responded that the healthcare
plan discouraged them from
hiring.
"Obamacare is really exhibit
number one of the president's
political philosophy and that
is that government knows bet-
ter than people how to run
your lives, it is a view that
the government should stand
between you and your doctor,"
Romney said. "I believe in free
people pursuing their dreams. I
believe in freedom."
Romney continually refer-
enced patriotic ideals, citing the
founding fathers and arguing
that his own vision for America
stems fromhis faith in the Con-
stitution and what it stands for,
especially in limitingthe power
of government.
"'We take our inspiration
from the founding documents
- the Declaration of Indepen-
dence and the Constitution. We
believe the founders were right
when they said that our rights
came from God not from gov-
ernment"
Though the crowd appeared
to be mostly comprised of mid-
dle-aged and older attendees,
younger members of the crowd
were vocal and energized.
Michigan native Taylor
Smelser, 19, said he believes
Romney is the practical choice
for president, despite Obama's
propensity to excite younger
voters.
"I think Obama's a really
good motivational speaker, so
he naturally catches the atten-
tion of younger people but I'm
really into politics, so I look
beyond just the flash of it."
Smelser said. "(Romney) just
needs to keep getting out there
and keep stating his plan. I
mean he's got so much ammu-
nition with the economy."
Perera was visiting Northern
India. Though she is not Sikh,
the solidarity she saw during
her visit motivated her to honor
the victims at the University.
"Being here, just being
around students, students with
such a strong faith, it was just
beautiful," Perera said. "It was
so calm to see another side of it
to see the great things, the posi-
tive things that such'a negative
event can bring up."
Green said she felt the event
was effective in raising aware-
ness about hate crime and
injustice and was impressed
by the diversity of the crowd,
though noted she would like to
see greater attendance at future
events.
"I think that this is a great
start and this is how you start
spreading the word," Green
said. "We took pictures and we
can spread that on Facebook,
so its impact will definitely go
beyond just this."

Michigan, Big Ten, fighting
perception of major decline

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily SportsEditor
Redshirt junior safety Thomas
Gordon answered as he was sup-
posed to, as he'd learned through
osmosis from Michigan coach
Brady Hoke. With two losses
already this season, has Michi-
gan taken a step back from last
year?
"We stillcan smell roses at the
end of therseason," Gordon said.
"That's our focus."
The start of the Big Ten sea-
sonasignals the start of the march
toward Hoke's stated goal each
year: a conference champion-
ship. But to those outside of the
conference who view Michigan
as a part of the Big Ten's swoon
this year, it might be too late to
change the sense that the Wol-
verines are moving backward.
At this time last year, Michi-
gan was 4-0,
and it would NOTEBOOK
win another
two games before losing its first.
There was no Alabama on the
schedule last season, but fair or
not, with a second loss early in
the season comes the perception
of regression.
Hoke repeatedly asserts that
he judges teams by conference
championships. He said last
year's 11-2 campaign was unsuc-
cessful because the Wolverines
fell shortcof a Big Ten title. Mich-
igan could lose more games this
season but by Hoke's metrics it
would be more successful as long
as it comes with a conference
championship.
Perceptions and benchmarks
matter, but, simply, Michigan has
not progressed as fast as it did in
Hoke's first year at the helm. The
Wolverines have scored less (by
14 points through four games)
and given up'more (41 points in
that span).
This year, Michigan's marked
decline in two areas have been
glaring. The line on both sides
of the ball has not controlled
the game. Last year, Michigan
rushed for 376 more yards than
its opponents through the first
four games. This year, it has
rushed for just 10 more yards.
Aside from senior quarterback
Denard Robinson, Michigan has
yet to have a 100-yard rusher.

Yet this year, success in the
Big Ten could do little to help
Michigan's reputation outside
of Schembechler Hall if on-field
performance continues to lag
behind last year's output.
For Hoke, though, the tar-
get remains the same as it ever
was. As he puts it, "Nothing's
changed."

"re-evaluate where we're at."
Fifth-year senior lineman Pat-
rick Omameh said this year's bye
week serves as a barrier between
non-conference and Big Ten play.
"This sort of serves as a mark-
er," Omameh said "It's all guns
blazing, and you're looking ahead
to the Big Ten season."
INJURY UPDATE: Hoke said
junior receiver Devin Gardner
shouldn't miss any significant
practice time this wek. Gardner
sustained injuries after barrel-
ing into the stands in the fourth
quarter at Notre Dame.
"Devin is in always pretty
mentally tough, you know," Hoke
said.
Junior safety Marvin Robin-
son didn't travel to South Bend,
but Hoke said he will likely play
in two weeks against Purdue.
Robinson sustained an unspeci-
fied - injury against Massachu-
setts. Of course, it's important to
take injury reports with a grain
of salt. Hoke was asked on Tues-
day whether he would support
mandatory injury reports in col-
lge football.
"I don't know," Hoke said. "Are
you trying to help the gamblers?
"That's basically nobody's
business but ours."

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
There is no doubt that No. 17
Michigan field'hockey team has
high hopes for its season. Com-
ing off of last year's Big Ten title,
the Wolverines (0-1 Big Ten, 6-4
overall) still remain among the
top teams in the conference.
But after losing its confer-
ence opener on Sunday against
No. 6 Penn State, 4-3, Michigan
learned it still has at least one
team to look up at.
"Penn State is a really strong
team this year," said Michigan
coach Marcia Pankratz. "Penn
State is the favorite this year and
playing them at home in the first
match is jumping in the deep end
right away."
It's easy to conclude how the
Wolverines lost the game after
getting outshot 30-14 and out-
cornered 13-3.
Yet, Pankratz said the loss
will prepare the team for the rest
of the season. With 19 first- and
second-year players on the ros-
ter, that experience might help
Michigan retain its conference
title.
"We have seven freshman
starting," said redshirt sopho-
more defenseman Leslie Smith.
"(This game) was kind of like a
wakeup call for them."
In Michigan's game against
Penn State (2-0, 10-2), the Nit-
tany Lions jumped out to a quick
3-0 lead in the first half of Sun-
day's game before the Wolver-
ines could register more than
one shot.
"The Big Ten is one of the
toughest conferences," Smith
said. "It's a lot more tough than

the ACC."
Some may disagree though,
considering the last 10 NCAA
champions have been ACC
schools, and the Wolverines'
first two losses of the season
were against ACC foes.
Regardless, some players do
note a difference in the style of
play between the two confer-
ences. a
"(The Big Ten has) a lot more
body-to-body play," Smith said.
"It's a lot different than who we
have been playing."
As a result, it could ben-
efit Michigan because so many
young players were able to get
experience against one of the
best teams in the Big Ten, let
alone the country.
"When you have some young-
er players, they just don't quite
know what to expect against a
team like Penn State," said Pan-
kratz. "Until you see it for your-
self, you can see we were a little
bit shell-shocked."
Now that this shock has
occurred, it's time for the young
Wolverines to regroup.
"We need to pick it up," said
junior forward Rachael Mack.
"We need tostep it up."
Mack, who led the team in
scoring the last two years, cur-
rently leads Michigan with 22
points, including 10 goals.
Mack has scored a point in
eight straight games, includ-
ing all 10 of her goals. If she
continues at this pace, it won't
be a surprise if the Wolverines
make another run at the Big Ten
crown.
"We'll be in the mix," Pan-
kratz said. "It'll be fun to watch
down the stretch."


Jaeger returns from Big Ben to the Bli
By RAJAT KHARE:
Daily Sports Writer

The mdst gifted men and
women in the world unleashed
their talents on sports' biggest
stage at the London Olympics
last summer.
From a new era for women's
gymnastics to the crowning of
the world's fastest man to the
retirement of one of the greatest
Olympians of all time, the Lon-
don Games didn't disappoint.
But for one Michigan Olym-
pian, London was all about intro-
ducing himself to the world.
Junior swimmer Connor Jaeger
traveled to London and repre-
sented the United States in the
1,500-meter freestyle.
"Honestly, throughout the
whole city you could just tell
that there was an energy about it
that was making it such a special
place," Jaeger said.
Last year, in addition to his
Olympic experience, Jaeger was
named to the Men's Swimming
and Diving NCAA All-American
squad in three separate events,
won the Big Ten Championships
and was named Big Ten Swim-
mer of the Week three times.
In London, Jaeger wasn't
scheduled to swim, though, until
the second week of the competi-
tion. So in his down time, he was
part of the American camp that
cheered on the other headliners
of the summer.
"Well, I'll admit it was hard
waiting the whole time, but hon-
estly, my teammates made it so
easy for me," Jaeger said. "I was
just there watching them race
really and seeing them do such a
great job."

ock'M'
his moment count.
"I wanted to perform well,
obviously, that was my number
one coricern," Jaeger said. "But
I wasn't going to let this experi-
ence go by me without recogniz-
ing how awesome it was."
. The final, though, was any-
thing but close. China's Sun Yang
distanced himself from the pack
from the very beginning and con-
tinued to build a leadthroughout.
Yang clocked in it at 14:31:02,
obliterating the previous world
record. Jaeger placed sixth.
"You could just
tell that there
was an energy
about (London)."
"He just kept blowing away
the whole time, not even close,"
Jaeger said with a laugh. "But its
cool. I think it's cool that I was in
that race, it's something that I'll
always remember."
With London behind him now,
Jaeger hopes to lead the Wolver-
ines to their third consecutive
Big Ten Championship as they
open their season against Wis-
consin Saturday at the Canham
Natatorium.
"Last year we placed fifth at
NCAAs," Jaeger said. "Going into
this season, we just want to do
better. We think we can be better.
We're working hard to make (this
season) better. That's our goal -
move forward and do better."

(alternatively known as "Crazy
Rap") by Afroman (alternativey
known as Joseph Edgar Fore-

ing-the-shit, tour de force rap
joint that consists of a bunch of
outlandishly chauvinistic sex-
capades told in succession over
some handclaps, guitar and bass.
And it's all brought to you by the
fine gentleman who put "Because

I don't hate "Colt 45" because
it's demeaning, vulgar and stupid.
I like plenty of other things that
are demeaning, vulgar and stupid.
I don't have any feminist-related
indignation, despite the pro-
pensity for most lines to closely
resemble the "I ate that pussy like

shrimp fried rice" line. It really
boils down to one simple quality
that I can't overlook: "Colt 45" is,
plain and simple, a really, really
fucking annoying song. And it
doesn'thelp that it goes on for-ev-
ER. Forever, I tell you. The thing
just doesn't quit.
And the other most annoying
part? Being able to recite every
single dumb and dirty verse was
a no-fail barometer of your Cool

that 14-year-old white Jewish kid
who doesn't smoke weed, has no
idea what seeds and stems are,
and is mispronouncing "tumble-

every line of "Colt 45?" Yeah,
man, he must be cool. Please.
Why was it that every time

"Colt 45" came on at a party in

would cease so a fake rap battle
could ensue? And by rap battle, I
mean a bunch of posturing subur-
ban kids trying to yell over each
other about banging chicks from
Hawaii, a KKK-affiliated father
and an '83 Cadillac Coup Deville.
Yes, because all of that hits so
close to home. The kids who loved
"Colt 45" were either stoners,
wannabe stoners, wannabe gang-
sters or kids who just didn't want
to feel left out for not knowing the
words. In a word: poseurs.
All this, for a song that prided
itself on being obscene instead of
actually good. Now that is some-
thing I can never understand.

her opinion on ASAN's mission.
If certain autistic individuals
considered autism to be an inte-
gral part of their personalities,
should the search for a cure be
put on hold?
Kobrick said she thought that
while high-functioning autis-
tic people - those with "special
math skills or scientific skills,"
as she putit - didn't necessar-
ily need to have a cure if they
didn't want it, the remainder of
the autistic population ought to
have one.
"You really have to look at
the kinds of people who are not
as high-functioning. There are
some people who cannot do
math problems," Kobrick said.
"At (one) school, they teach them
how to fold their socks and put
the laundry away. Things like
that. They need a cure."
John Best, author of the Hating
Autism blog, put it in more suc-
cinct terms: "It's time to put an
end to celebrating having brain
damage," he said in a New York
Magazine article on the autistic
self-advocacy movement.
In Ohio, an ASAN protest
against an Autism Speaks walk

geau's "wingman."
"I got sick of it. I got sick of
working my ass off and getting
yelled at. I got sick of getting
very little recognition within
ASAN. Advocacy will beat you
down if you let it."
Redefining disability
In the field of academia, Yer-
geau encountered different chal-
lenges: those of incorporation
and ethos.
During the job search, she
often tried to "pass" for nor-
mal, worried that displaying too
much of her disability would
cause others to find her unable
to deal with the stresses of daily
life. So she practiced eye con-
tact. She rehearsed questions
and answers for small talk, add-
ing in "um"s and "uh"s to make
her speech sound more natural.
She sat on her hands so that she
wouldn't visibly stim. But, after
long days, the system would
break down.
Conferences were difficult.
Yergeau would get overwhelmed
by the masses of people coming
out of the ballrooms, the nev-
er-ending buzz that emanated

from all parts of the building,
the orange lizard pattern on the
carpet. It was difficult for her
to initiate social interactions. At
banquets, she would nod, smile
and push food around her plate.
Classes were difficult. In grad-
uate school, Yergeau took small
seminars composed of fewer
than eight or nine people. Par-
ticipating verbally was a strug-
gle for her. She couldn't keep
track of the group conversations
quickly enough, always trying to
figure out who was saying what.
And because she was unwilling
to fully disclose her autism, she
had to find alternative ways of
contributing.
But what happened if a por-
tion of her grade depended on
participation?
"It really sucked," she said,
laughing. "It wasn't really some-
thing I could do. The strange
thing is, if the class required a
presentation or something that
could be memorized, I was abso-
lutely fine. But if it's actually
interacting back and forth, then
it just totally broke down."
Autistic and proud
A few years ago, Yergeau came
to a critical decision. She made
the choice to disclose her disabil-
ity in everything she wrote.
"(Before), I only told select
people that I was autistic and
I'd rather people assume I was
really, really weird than assume
anything else," she said. "And
now, I'm very, very open about it,
and my hope is that other people
are open about it."
Nowadays, she's grown com-
fortable with sharing many
aspects of her autism - on her
blog, aspie rhetor, inop-ed piec-
es, even in her aademic papers.
Her voice - urgent, pleading,
sometimes angry - has become a
staple of her writings, academic
or otherwise.
"It's a really hard-hitting
voice, an insightful voice," said
English Prof. Cynthia Selfe, Yer-
geau's adviser at Ohio State. "It's
somethingthat makes people pay
attention because it's so honest."
"I am deathly polite," Yergeau
writes in a webtext published
in Computers and Composition
Online. "I stare at the bridge of
your nose when you speak to me,
and I nod, even if I haven't the
slightest idea as to what you're
saying, because I know that nod-
ding is appropriate, as is the illu-
sion that I'm sharing an eye-gaze
with you rather than counting
the pores on your cheekbones. I
empathize with your ear lobe."
Disclosure in academic writ-
ing has been a form of activism
for Yergeau.
"As a disabled person and an

academic, when I read people
who have that sort of authorial
presence, it is so meaningful to
see people putting themselves
out there," she said. "I think the
primary reason why I disclose is
because there needs to be some
kind of visibility to (autism)."
Yergeau is embarkingon a new
chapter of her life as she starts
the seven-year climb to obtain-
ing tenure. Whether she will
remain permanently employed
at the University will depend on
what she publishes and presents
in the next few years.
In many ways, academia has
been the right path for her. Like
many autistic individuals, she
has hyperfocus. It shows in the
prolificacy of her work: Yergeau
has amassed an enormous num-
ber of published abstracts and
video texts during her short time
in the field, all of them meticu-
lously composed.
Yet Yergeau still consid-
ers herself to be disabled. She
continues to seek out disabil-
ity accommodations as a faculty
member, teaching all her classes
in computer labs so as to fake eye
contact better. Surrounded by
a sea of computer screens, she
can create the illusion of looking
at the students without actually
looking at the students.
And she's worried thather dis-
ability might hold her back from
obtaining the position and status
she wants.
"When we're talking about
disability, including anything
that can be considered men-
tal disability, there's so much
stigma," she said. "Speaking on
a wider scale, faculty with dis-
abilities are often invisible and
they often aren't tenure-track.
And there are just a lot of issues
regarding the whole process and
how disability enters into that."
The perils of disclosure
But how much disclosure is
too much? There are things she
won't talk about. In her second
week at the University, Yergeau
was involuntarily committed
to the psychiatric ward at the
University hospital. She wrote
an impassioned blog post about
it after the fact, full of bile and
anguish. But in the shadow life
of her office, she stays taciturn.
She regrets that she shared too
much, she tells me.
Is it ever a worry that you're
revealing too much of yourself
on the Internet? I ask her. Do you
ever have regrets over the con-
tent you choose to disclose?
"It's very much a worry," Yer-
geau said. "It's always been a
worry. The longer you do this,
the more people you begin to
know and meet and the more

public it feels."
I know a lot of things about
Yergeau. Before meeting her, I
knew that she doesn't like the
texture of fruit. I knew about
her obsession with Electric Light
Orchestra. It's both uncomfort-
able and familiar knowing such
intimate details about a person
you've never met before.
She is married, but I don't ask
questions about her husband.
She is a first-generation college
student. Her family, from what
I've gathered, is Pentecostal.
"There are certain things that
I won't disclose," Yergeau said,
tentatively. There are details she
still wants to have control over.
She considers herself to be a pri-
vate person. "But it's hard."
But how much control does
Yergeau really have over the
things she says? Even if she
chooses to move on or research
other things, memories of her
past self will forever cling to the
blogosphere.
To me, there seems to be a
marked conflict between her
wish to keep her personal life
private and her obligation - we
could even call it "responsibility"
- to disclose.
It is, in a sense, a responsibili-
ty. Yergeau broughtup the notion
of beinga disability role model in
the academic and activist sphere
as motivation for her disclosure.
She said she aspired to be some-
one who could pave the way for
a younger generation to explore
and question notions of mental
disability.
So far, she's already impacted
a number of people - friends,
peers, strangers, superiors.
"I don't feel like I can bring
some of my ideas to some of my
professors, but with (Yergeau),
I feel very comfortable doing
that," said LSA senior Emily Bre-
hob, whose honors thesis Yer-
geau advises.
"She's taught me a lot of
things," Selfe said. "She's taught
me how to be braver in my own
writing. Her writing reminds
me of how important that kind
of personal honesty is, and how
valuable it can be for everyone."
I'm reminded of a YouTube
video ofa protest orchestrated by
ASAN against an Autism Speaks
walk in central Ohio. The pro-
testers, there are maybe eight
or nine in total, look sad, but
determined. Wobbly choruses of
"Autism Speaks needs to listen!"
scatter across the Columbus
streets. Yergeau, holding a large
posterboard stamped with the
text "LISTEN TO ME, I HAVE
AUTISM," can be seen among
them.
"Wherever she goes, Melanie
helps people open their eyes,"
Selfe said.

The 'Wave Field' on North Campus is often not recognized as art.
Secret art all around 'U'

Students react to
obscure pieces of
artwork on campus
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Students spin it in on their
way to class, tour guides point it
out to prospective students and
campus visitors stop by to have
their picture taken with it. The
Cube - or the "Endover," it's
official title - is the most rec-
ognizable sculpture on campus.
But this campus staple is just
one of many University-owned
pieces around campus.
The University President's
Advisory Committee on Public
Art highlights pieces of pub-
lic art the University owns or
has been lent and lists about
100 pieces on its website. Those
include the Block M on the Diag,
Michigan Stadium and the giant
spindles of orange I-beams that
seem to have fallen onto each
other in front of the University
of Michigan Museum of Art.
But throughout campus, there
are University-owned artworks -
particularly sculptures - that are
unknown, unclear, hidden in plain
view or just painfully obvious.
"They just call it the naked
statue, that's all Iknow about it,"
LSA junior Chris Chou said. "It's
kind of like a landmark."
Chou is referring to the
"Regeneration of Time": a stat-
ue of a man holding a small boy
next to a woman holding an
apple, and, aside from a taste-
fully placed leaf, all three are
completely nude.
"Regeneration" stands on the
corner of Glen Avenue and Cath-
erine Street near the Medical
Campus, in front of a parking
garage by Angelo's restaurant.
According to its description
on the committee's website, the
man and woman are carrying.
the child to the hospital, though
casual'observers often miss the
intent.
LSA freshman Lili Thomases
discussed the work with friends
as they waited for lunch at
Angelo's, a restaurant across the
intersection. from the "Regen-
eration of Time."
"I know an apple is a sym-

bol of temptation, so it could be
Adam and Eve," Thomases said.
"Doesn't it symbolize knowl-
edge though too?" another girl
suggested.
They thought aloud for a few
moments, positing different pos-
sibilities for the statue. When
it was clear there was no one,
clear answer, they mostly came
to agreement that the statue was
different.
"I think it's really weird ... out
of place," LSA freshman Leah
Schatz said.
Still, Thomases questioned
the validity of that assertion,
asking if there could even be a
right space for the statue.
"Is there honestly the prop-
er space for art?" she said. "I
wouldn't say that's an improper
spot for anything ... you don't
need to go to the museum to go
see art."
"Where else would it be put?"
another friend quipped.
Nonetheless, the statue con-
tinues to have at least one specific
purpose, even if wasn't the sculp-
ture's intended purpose, LSA
freshman Krista Moussavi said.
"It definitely is a point where
people reference to," she said.
"We're always like, 'oh there's
the naked statue we'll meet over
there."'
Much farther north than the
"Regeneration of Time," there
is a sculpture whose purpose
is abundantly clear, but whose
existence, and even designa-
tion as a sculpture, is relatively
unknown.
It's not even marked on the
map of North Campus outside
the Pierpont bus stop. Unless
a student is familiar with the
"Wave Field," the small bumps
drawn on the map would give
no cartographical indication of
what those bumps mean to the
viewer.
The field is known almost
exclusively to Engineering and
Art & Design students and the
residents of North Campus brave
enough to venture beyond the
Duderstadt Center. The "Wave
Field," designed by Maya Lin,
the designer of the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial, is tucked
away in a courtyard of engineer-
ing buildings and consists of
rows of crisscrossing waves that
intersect the turf to form grassy

moguls.
Engineering sophomore Eldy
Zuniga said he was unaware that
his frequent nap spot was also a
work of art.
"I'm very bad with arts. I'm
not sure what defines a sculp-
ture or not," Zuniga said. "It's
just a place to chill - it's nice to
look at. I go to the (Wilson Stu-
dent Team Project Center) all
the time so whenever I get here
early I just lay down and nap for
a little bit."
While the "Regeneration of
Time" can bring about discus-
sion regarding the purpose and
intention of where we display
art, the "Wave Field" has tran-
scended those questions.
"The thing is just to be enjoyed
regardless of whether or not it's
a sculpture," Zuniga said. "You'll
always find, at least some point
in the day, someone will be here
just chilling. That's constant, it
doesn't matter what day it is."
'' llg a ''II

But Zuniga added that the
time of day does change how stu-
dents use the "Wave Field."
"It's most popular at night,"
he said. "Every other (oscilla-
tion) will have a random couple."
When Zuniga took a moment
to think over the field, he said he
recognized its beauty, but noted
its special meaningto engineers.
Engineering and Art & Design
students are different lots, but
the small grassy dunes are actu-
ally made up of sine and cosine
waves, which are relevant to
both groups.
"It fits here," Zuniga said, add-
ing that the machine used to cut
the grass was specially designed
at the University.
Apart from the "Regeneration
of Time" and the "Wave Field,"
public art abounds throughout
the University. Most students
might be surprised just how
much art they could be missing
