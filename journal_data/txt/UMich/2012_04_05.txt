UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION KICK IT
'U' expenses
impacted by
compliance

Officials expect
to spend an
additional $1
million
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
Various federal regulations
covering topics ranging from
privacy of academic records to
safety procedures for medical
experiments and faculty train-
ing, will continue to increase
University expenses in the next
year as additional regulations
are introduced.
According to Martha Pol-
lack,theUniversityviceprovost
for academic and budgetary
affairs, the University expects
to spend between $750,000
and $1 million more on compli-
ance than last year due to new
regulations from the National
Institutes of Health and other
government agencies in the
next fiscal year. The increase is
just the latest in a yearly cycle
of spending more to meet new
compliance standards.
According to a rough
estimate provided by the
University, the University cur-
rently spends between $22 mil-

lion and $24 million annually
on compliance issues - a figure
that does not include athlet-
ics or the University of Michi-
gan Health System, which are
funded separately.
"No one ever wants to spend
money on compliance," Pollack
said. "It's not an area where you
have to push us to be efficient.
We will naturally be as efficient
as we possibly can be."
Pollack said other new com-
pliance costa, such as augment-
ed infection control systems in
the Health Services Building,
were accreditation compliance
costs rather than research-
related costs.
In a March 22 interview,
University Provost Philip
Hanlon said the new disclo-
sure requirement from NIH
would require the University to
assemble an "elaborate" elec-
tronic database tracking con-
flicts of interest at a recurring
cost of $700,000 annually. He
also cited new mandatory eth-
icstrainingfor researchers who
work with human subjects as
an additional compliance cost.
"We do north of a half-billion
dollars in research for NIH,
and this is a very big deal," Pol-
lack said. "They've changed
the reporting requirements,

'U' offers mental health aid

If needed, students
are encouraged
to utilize campus
programs
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Staff Reporter
In light of the recent off-cam-
pus deaths of two University stu-
dents, and as finals season fast
approaches, mental health pro-

fessionals from across campus,
in interviews with The Michigan
Daily, urged students who are
struggling to utilize the variety
of services offered to students
with psychological difficulties.
One of the most visible men-
tal health resources on campus
is Counseling and Psychological
Services. CAPS provides a wide
array of services to students seek-
ing help with psychological and
behavioral issues. In addition to
CAPS, the University also offers
immediate guidance to students

at the University Health Service
and at the University Hospital
through its University of Michi-
gan Health System Psychiatric
Emergency Service program.
CAPS AIDS WITH
PREVENTATIVE AND
PROACTIVE SERVICES
CAPS Director Todd Sevig,
the campus lead for student men-
tal health, emphasized the role
of CAPS in identifying mental
health problems in students, fac-

ulty and staff.
"We know, the sooner you
catch things and the earlier you
intervene, you have a better
outcome," Sevig said. "So with
mental health care, what we're
talking about is the whole host
of wellness services, of online
quick things that you can look at
... and we know that that prevents
things from getting worse."

Mental Health Workgroup - a

ACADEMIC TESTING
Students
await MCAT
alterations
Upcoming changes
to test will take
effect in 2015
By JOSH QIAN
Daily StaffReporter
Members of the Univer-
sity's medical community have
expressed mixed emotions on
pending changes to the Medi-
cal College Admission Test,
which will be implemented in an
attempt to help medical schools
select more well-rounded candi-
dates who excel beyond the sci-
ences.
The MCAT is a standardized,
multiple-choice examination
administered by the Association
of American Medical Colleges
and required for admission by
most medical schools in the Unit-
ed States. The test is currently
composed of four sections: physi-
cal sciences, verbal reasoning,
writing sample and biological
sciences. However, in February,
the AAMC approved three major
changes to the exam, which will
go into effect in January 2015.
According to the preview
guide for MCAT2015 published
by the AAMC, the natural sci-
ences sections have been revised
to reflect recent changes in medi-
cal education. In addition, two

In honor of winning the
22nd annual Golden Apple
Award, American Culture lec-
turer Bruce Conforth delivered
his ideal last lecture, "Heed-

ing the Call," to an audience
of about 200 students, faculty
and community members in
Rackham Auditorium, utiliz-
ing his multitude of popular
culture references and person-
al anecdotes.
Conforth, who was among
about 100 nominees, was pre-
sented the Golden Apple for
his exceptional dedication to
teaching. He said receiving
the award was the most mem-
orable moment in his entire

career, which includes serving
as the director of curatorial
and educational affairs at the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Museum in Cleveland.
On March 14, the Students
Honoring Outstanding Teach-
ing, a University of Michigan
Hillel student committee,
presented Conforth with the
Golden Apple Award - the
only student-bestowed award
for teaching at the University.

Learning to apply]

What classes do you teach,
and what is your favorite
class to teach?
I am currently off this term
from teaching due to duties as
chair of the physics depart-
ment, but Iam helping out once
a week with Physics 160: Fresh-
man Honors Mechanics. That
is perhaps my most enjoyable
hour of the week. I help stu-
dents learn how to use comput-
ers to solve interesting physics
problems. Next term, I am
planning a class on the physics
of sports. It will be a real phys-
ics class. Should be fun though.
Why did you choose to teach
at the University and what
is your favorite thing about

being a professor here?
Michigan was starting up a
new Applied Physics program
in 1987. I really liked the multi-
disciplinary aspects of the pro-
gram. Ann Arbor seemed like a
great place to live. It's been 25
years, but seems like yesterday.
I love the size and quality of the
University. Michigan is very
good in every field, sometimes
even the best. There is just far
too much going on at Michigan
to experience it all.
You were recognized for your
excellence in undergraduate
teaching with an Arthur F.
Thurnau Professorship title.
How does this make you feel?

physics
is a great honor. I very much
enjoyed teaching even before I
became a professor. It is really
nice to be recognized as doinga
good job at it.
Do you have any hidden tal-
ents?
Well, I scuba dive, play hockey
and shoot photography in my
spare time. Talent is a more
difficult question.
What are your plans for this
summer?
My wife and I are going back-
packing for a week on Isle
Royale. We hope to both sur-
vive and see some moose.

Michigan State University
says its applications for the com-

30,000 for the first time in its
history.
The university says as of Fri-
day, 30,055 students had applied
for admission for the fall semes-
ter.
Admissions Director James
Cotter says the East Lansing
school expects to offer admis-
sion to about 20,000 students for
the fall. The university says it got
26,907 applications last year and
25,349 in 2009.
Cotter says the university

Miraculously, no one was seri-

BAMAKO, MALI
Islamists impose
sharia sharia law in
city of Timbuktu
Mali's crisis deepened yes-
terday, as officials in the fabled
northern city of Timbuktu con-
firmed that the Islamic rebel
faction that seized control of
the town over the weekend has
announced it will impose sharia
law.
Rebels in the country's distant
north have taken advantage of
the power vacuum created last
month when renegade soldiers in
the capital of Bamako overthrew
the nation's democratically
elected leader. In the chaos that
followed the March 21 coup, they
advanced on strategic towns in
the north, including the ancient
city of Timbuktu, located over
620 miles (1,000 kilometers)
from the capital.
The ethnic Tuareg rebels
included a secular faction fight-
ing for independence, and an
Islamic wing, Ansar Dine, whose
reclusive leader called a meet-
ing of all the imams in the city
yesterday to make his announce-
ment.

CONFORTH
From Page 1A
The group surprised him dur-
ing one of his classes with maize
and blue balloons and a crowd of
students with harmonicas and
guitars.
The award highlighted one
of Conforth's favorite teaching
ideals - that students are not
the only individuals receiving
an education during the teach-
ing process. Conforth said the
award aims to encourage teach-
ers to consistently teach each
lecture as if it were their last,
which he said he strived to do in
his speech.
Conforth has taught for more
than 20 years, the past eight
years being at the University,
and specializes in a variety of
humanities courses, such as folk-
lore, blues music, popular culture
and the history of social move-
ments.
During the lecture, Conforth
spoke about the importance of
livinga fulfilling life and encour-
aged adhering to "a life full of
passion."
After pursuing careers in
neuropsychiatry, social work,
museum studies, art and music,

Conforth said he discovered
his true passion was ultimately
teaching.
"That's what teaching is about:
passing on a portion of yourself,"
Conforth said. "What could be
more honest or important than
that - the passing of tradition
and humanity?"
According to Conforth, teach-
ing is about being honest and
engaging, adding that education
and fun do not need to be mutu-
ally exclusive.
"It's about following your pas-
sion and what that might mean
in your life and how you go about
doing that without giving up
on some of the other things you
have to do in life," Conforth said.
"There's nothing more important
thanbeingpassionate aboutwhat
you do, no matter what it is."
Conforth's last lecture probed
how to live life to the fullest in a
practical and self-fulfilling man-
ner.
"The secret to a truly mean-
ingful existence, I think, is in
always holding on to the abil-
ity to define yourself, no matter
who or how many times some-
one tries to define you for your-
self," Conforth said. "And part
of that internal power to define
yourself comes from livinga life

full of passion."
The lecture culminated in a
prolonged standing ovation. In
an interview after the speech,
LSA senior Elisabeth Dion said
Conforth is a terrific lecturer,
adding that she laughed dur-
ing every class when she took
American Culture 209: The
History of American Popular
Music with Conforth.
"Every day, he had a great
story or funny quip that went
with each topic," Dion said. "He
told us about how he played in
the same bar as Bruce Spring-
steen way back in the day and
about how he met with Yoko
ono to get memorabilia for the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
LSA senior Arthur Snow,
who attended the lecture, said
he appreciated Conforth's
speech, and his radiant dedica-
tion to education and learning.
"His passion was evident,
and ittruly did put anewspin on
old repeated ideas," Snow said.
"He managed to give them an
impact that certainly resonated
with me and, I think, resonated
with everyone else in the room.
And I think that speaks to his
own experiences and the way
that he has gone about heeding
his own call."

It's not cemented; it's very much
malleable," Kohen said.
Robert Simmons, the assis-
tant event coordinator and com-
munity center manager at Baits
II, said the participants took the
time to think and reflect as they
went through the interactive
engagement events.
At the event, Simmons said he
ran the "Perfect Day" workshop,
which allowed participants to
identify six parts of their ideal
day.
"We wanted the attendees to
realize that a simple task, such as
taking the time to relax and read
the book, will have an impact on
their day," Simmons said. "There
are little things they can do to
make their day better."
Simmons added that the event
provided him with an opportu-

nity to bring the values he pro-
motes as a residence education
professional staff member to the
border community.
"This was a continuum about
positive energy and wellness to
help people think about their
social identity, them as a person
and their well-being," Simmons
said. "This intertwined the cam-
pus and the community and so
many aspects of the Ann Arbor
community."
LSA sophomore Lauren Bur-
ton, student event coordinator
said the workshops introduced
communication strategies that
would help participants improve
their relationships.
"Epitome, the wellness con-
tinuum, is divided into two
separate blocks of activities,
Burton said. "The first block is
the relationship block to help
participants reflect on their cur-
rent relationships. The second
block focused on giving partici-

pants the skills to make a posi-
tive change."
LSA junior Sean Houchins,
another student event coordi-
nator, organized a workshop to
help participants understand
the impact that certain commu-
nication styles may have on the
productivity and the positivity
of conversation.
"The volunteers will respond
to the participants. It's interest-
ing for the participants to go
through and see the response
styles," Houchins said.
LSA sophomore Julia Moger-
man said she went to the event
because all the students in the
Screen Arts & Cultures depart-
ment received an e-mail inform-
ing them that the movie was
showing for free.
"We decided to come here to
watch Harry Potter, " Moger-
man said. "We didn't know an
event was taking place, but the
event sounded pretty cool."

Detroit gives state powers
to help rescue finances

City Council
agrees to consent
agreement in
5-4 vote
DETROIT (AP) - Detroit
leaders reluctantly agreed
yesterday to let the state take
a more active role in restruc-
turing the cash-strapped city,
reaching a deadline-beating
deal that avoids the embarrass-
ment of Michigan's governor
appointing a financial overseer
for City Hall.
By a 5-4 vote, the City Coun-
cil decided to allow Michigan
officials monitor and have
input into how to fix Detroit's
broken finances. Facing a $200
million deficit and $13.2 billion
in long-term structural debt,
the city is at risk of running out
of cash by the end of May.
Gov. Rick Snyder had given
the city until today to sign off
on the agreement or risk the
appointment of an emergency
manager to take over. The deal
was expected to be signed by
Snyder and Mayor Dave Bing,
who was readmitted to a hos-
pital yesterday as a precaution
because of discomfort follow-
ing surgery to correct a perfo-
rated colon.
Although many of the
details are unclear, the agree-
ment lets Bing and the council
keep authority over the city's
finances and budget. How-
ever, they would be required
to renegotiate recently ratified
union concessions and share
decision-making with a newly
hired project manager and
chief financial officer. A nine-
member board would monitor
the city's fiscal restructuring.
"The Detroit City Council's
vote ... represents a pivotal
moment in Detroit's history,"
Deputy Mayor Kirk Lewis said
in a statement. "It is time now
to begin the monumental task
of stabilizing Detroit's finan-

cial operations."
"The mayor and his admin-
istration worked with the City
Council and the state to devel-
op a consent agreement that
we believe puts us on track to
restructure our city financially
and re-establish an infrastruc-
ture to make sure Detroit never
faces these financial conditions
again."
Snyder released a statement
crediting the council for acting
"responsibly to put Detroit on
the path to financial stability."
"We all want Detroit to suc-
ceed," Snyder said. ".. While
the council's action is a posi-
tive step, there's no doubt that
much work remains. The mag-
nitude of the city's financial
challenges means that many
difficult decisions lie ahead."
The Detroit case is the high-
est-profile yet involving a con-
troversial year-old Michigan
law that gives the state more
power to intervene in finan-
cially troubled cities and school
systems. Emergency manag-
ers have the power to toss out
union contracts and strip local-
ly elected leaders of author-
ity. A petition drive aimed at
overturning the Michigan
law is trying to qualify for the
November ballot.
The former manufactur-
ing giant has been floundering
financially for years, partly
due to the ups and downs of
Detroit's automakers and a
declining tax base as people
and businesses left the city.
Past leaders also failed to cur-
tail spending and cut jobs to
keep pace with losses in rev-
enue.
When Bing took office in
2009, the city's deficit topped
$300 million. He has since cut
2,000 jobs through layoffs and
by not filling open positions.
The deal reached yester-
day compels Detroit to meet
timelines in putting together
city budgets and to accurately
update revenue predictions. City
departments are expected to be

slimmed down or consolidated
if savings can be made. Work
currently performed by some
unionized employees could be
outsourced to save money.
Missed deadlines and failure
to comply with those and other
terms of the agreement could
be constituted as a breach of
the deal and lead to the state's
withholding of revenue sharing
and preventing the city from
entering the capital markets to
sell bonds. At worst, the state
Treasurer's office also could
place the city in receivership.
The nine-member financial
advisory board will monitor
how Detroit manages its lim-
ited resources and report back
to the state. It also will make
recommendations to the mayor
and help the city in preparing
its 3-year budget.
Bing will hire a chief finan-
cial officer to supervise finance
and budget activities. That per-
son will be selected from a list
of candidates agreed to by Bing
and Treasurer Andy Dillon.
Still, it likely will be amatter
of years before the changes to
Detroit's financial and opera-
tional structure show results,
Dillon said yesterday.
Up until the weekend, first-
term Councilman Andre Spivey
had been leaning toward voting
in favor of the measure. Yester-
day, he voted against it.
"There is no financial sup-
port attached," he said after
the vote. "We won't know six
to nine months to a year (how
it will work) ... but it's here now
and we must work with it."
Council members last
Thursday discussed Snyder's
proposal and spent the week-
end reviewing it. Some blasted
a portion of the document that
tossed out concessions on pay,
health benefits and pensions
recently reached between Bing
and city unions.
Snyder has said those con-
cessions don't go far enough
help solve the city's fiscal chal-
lenges.

Leave the 'U' alone
The state Legislature shouldn't ban unionization
Whether graduate student research assistants should have
the right to vote to form a union has been a hot topic of
conversation at the University, and it has even reached
the state Legislature. House Republicans passed a bill in March clas-
sifying GSRAs as students, and thus denying them the right to form a
union. With Republicans' legislative maneuvering, the bill went into
effect immediately, rather than waiting the usual 90 days after the leg-
islative session ends. House Democrats sued the Republicans claim-
ing they did not count the votes accurately to ensure that a two-thirds
majority was met to pass the bill. A judge in Ingham County ruled in
favor of the Democrats on Monday, but the state Legislature has no
business interfering with University matters in the first place.


I hope that we're able to resolve our nomination
process as soon as possible.
- Presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney said when asked if his fellow Republican challengers should drop
out of the primary after his three wins on Tuesday, as reported by the Washington Post.
Financial renaissance

a

On Monday, the University's Board of
Regents voted 5-3 to file an amicus brief to
support the Democrats' lawsuit. Five of the
board's six Democrats thought that the correct
procedures weren't followed. Meanwhile, the
two Republicans and Regent Olivia Maynard
(D-Goodrich) didn't think that it was their
place to get involved with legislative matters.
It's promising to see the Board of Regents.
standing up for students. The regents are sup-
posed to advocate for students, and this is
exactly the type of issue the regents should
focus on. The legislative body made an error in
judgment and procedure, and while it's not the
regents' job to point this out in every circum-
stance, it's important that they do so when the
issues affect the University.
The legislature has no business getting
involved in University matters. The Uni-
versity is a public school, and thus, the state
should have some input on its running, but
the regents are elected by a state-wide vote for
that very reason. It also sets a bad precedent
if the legislation can control the University by
circumventing the House rules. The Michi-

gan Employment Relations Commission was
holding its own hearing on the issue when the
Republicans decided to pass the bill and enact
it immediately, simply because they dislike
unions. The state should allow the University
and its regents to handle their own affairs.
As the state has continually decided to cut
funding to the University, it should now also
have less control over how the University is run.
The regents are supposed to be the state's voice
on campus, and they have decided to back the
Democrats. The state should not get involved in
a matter that only affects a small percent of stu-
dents at the University. The University should
deal with the problem without outside pres-
sures and restrictions from the state.
The Democrats prevailed in their lawsuit
because House Republicans ignored procedure
and got involved in an issue that was none of
their concern. They should have left the Uni-
versity in the hands of the regents. The regents
represent a balance between student and state
needs, and by taking a stand on an issue that
concerns a group of students on campus, they
are doing their job in advocating for both.

f someone asks, "What is the
first thing you do when you
open an Internet browser?"
what would
you say? If your
answer is logging
onto Facebook,
you are definitely
not alone.
Social net-
working is a
growing mam-
moth. In 2011, JASON
the industry had PANG JAO
1.2 billion users
and experienced
a 41.4-percent growth in revenue
from the previous year. The develop-
ment of a dense network that links
billions gave rise to aplethoraofsuc-
cessful sub-industries, one of which
is called crowdfunding.
The idea is simple. An entrepre-
neur, philanthropist, filmmaker,
musician or scientist comes up with
a brilliant idea. She wants to act on
the idea but holds in her pocket only
her lunch money, which of course,
she intends to keep. Crowdfunding
lets her post her idea on a funding
portal on the Internet and collect
funds from the general public.
This is contrary to the conven-
tional funding sources such as Busi-
ness Angel and Venture Capital,
where a large portion of the found-
ed entity's equities are exchanged
for small capital early on. It is also
different from credit card and bank
loans, where the borrower often
would have to personally guaran-
tee with her and other people's per-
sonal assets of the repayment of the
debt. In return for the funds, sup-
porters seek rewards such as signed
CDs, tickets to film premiers and
cool new gadgets.
I call crowdfunding the Finan-
cial Renaissance because it has the
potential to revolutionize the way
people finance their projects and
businesses in the future. For one,
crowdfunding already helped tens
of thousands of projects collect
funding. One example is Printrbot:

Your First 3D Printer. Project ini-
tiator Brook Drumm raised $10,000
in the first 11 hours of listing and
reached his goal of $25,000 in just
45 hours. Drumm doubled his goal
in just three days, and by the 30-day
closing period, his project raised
more than $830,000.
Crowdfunding gives people an
alternative to the conventional
funding sources. Startups without
large growth potential, billion-
dollar revenue projection or stellar
connections with venture capital-
ists rarely succeed in signing a term
sheet with the venture capitals.
Experts have seen financing terms
that are disadvantageous and even
detrimental to the growth and
development of early-stage busi-
nesses, such as impossible-to-reach
targets, restrictions on raising more
funds and mandatory exit at the end
of an investment horizon, meaning
that they pull the plug whether your
business is ready or not.
Certain businesses such as organic
coffee shops, boutique retailers and
mobile application developers don't
necessarily require the supervision
of business incubators, or firms that
provide both money and insights.
While insights are great, they also
come at great expenses to the busi-
ness owners, sometimes in the form
of someone calling your office every
day to check on you. Crowdfunding
provides a faster and simpler way for
people who simply need the money
to raise capital from the $60-bil-
lion friends-and-family fund market
through digital platforms.
While the crowdfunding industry
is still in the developmental stage,
signs of great momentum are emerg-
ing. Kickstarter, one of the largest
crowdfunding sites in the United
States, recently completed its first
three multi-million dollar fundrais-
ers, one of which raised an aston-
ishing total of $3.3 million dollars
(Double Fine Adventure - a video
game). Other crowdfunders like
IndieGoGo and Crowdcube are also
attractinglarge user bases.

The Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act recently passed in both
the Senate and the House in a rare
bipartisan effort to induce entrepre-
neurial activities. Itlegalizes, among
other things, equity-based crowd-
funding in the U.S., or the option for
an entrepreneur to exchange shares
of her company for seed money.
David Welinsky, co-founder of
Minute Capital, a new crowdfunder
founded by students of the Universi-
ty, says his firm expects to launch an
equity-based feature on its upcom-
ing crowdfunding site after the act is
signed into law on Thursday.
Crowdfunding
gives start-ups
money they need.
"We are very excited that this law
is being passed," Welinsky said. "We
want to help entrepreneurs grow
their businesses."
Some people remain skeptical
about the act. Andrew Sorkin of
The New York Times says startups
might benefit at investors' expenses
if the companies' managers employ
accounting gimmicks in their finan-
cial statements. The Securities
Exchange Commission is expected
to come out with a series of disclo-
sure requirements for companies
and crowdfunders who wish to par-
ticipate in equity-based crowdfund-
ing, according to the JOBS Act.
Despite some shortcomings, I
think crowdfunding has a long but
optimistic road ahead. Crowdfund-
ing combines the power of the crowd
with the wit of American entrepre-
neurs in the hopes of spurring inno-
vation and organically creating jobs.
Who knows? IntO years, maybe any-
one can be a Mark Zuckerberg.

Correlation and causation

ne month out of each semes-
ter, we GSIs must pay union
dues or a service represen-
tation fee to our
union, the Grad-
uate Employees'
Organization.
I had forgot-
ten that March
is one of those
months, and I
had an interest-
ing discussion MATTHEW
with myself as ZABKA
I looked at my
last paystub and
found that because of union dues, my
check was less than I had expected.
On one hand, I don't like being
forced to give the GEO money,
which it then uses to fight for
causes with which I don't agree.
On the other hand, if workers were
not forced to pay dues to the union
that represents them, there could
be an incentive for those workers to
free ride - meaning a worker could
expect union perks while not con-
tributing his or her fair share for
such benefits.
Unlike most discussions I have
with myself, this one is also taking
place across the country. Republi-
cans in several states such as Michi-
gan have mulled over introducing
right-to-work legislation that would
ban requiring union dues as a con-
dition of employment. While both
sides of the right-to-work issue have
reasonable claims, and debating
right-to-work laws is important for
society, politicians and the media
have, as usual, reduced a worthy
policy debate to bad rhetoric and an
even worse use of statistics.
The rhetoric includes some who
have mockingly branded right-
to-work laws as "right to work for
less" laws. They claim that the laws
weaken unions, which in turn lead to

reduced wages.
One user of such rhetoric, Prof.
David Schultz of the School of Busi-
ness at Hamline University in Min-
neapolis, Minn., has attempted to
justify this claim using statistics.
Before looking at Schultz's reason-
ing, one must understand what the
statistical term correlation means
and what it tells us.
Correlation is a number between
-1 and 1 that measures the strength
of an association between two sets of
data that are collected for the same
individuals. A correlation close to
-1 or 1 suggests a strong association,
while a correlation closer to 0 sug-
gests a weak association.
If a correlation is positive, one
expects points of the two sets of
data to increase together. For exam-
ple, if one looks at the heights and
weights of individuals, one would
expect a positive correlation, since
taller people tend to be heavier than
shorter people.
If a correlation is negative, one
expects points of one set of data
to decrease as points of the other
increase. One might expect a nega-
tive correlation between students'
time spent on Facebook and stu-
dents' GPAs. Time spent on Face-
book is time not spent studying, so
increased time on Facebook may be
associated with a lower GPA.
Back to right-to-work laws. Schul-
tz measured the correlation between
right-to-work laws in states and
median family income. He found a
weak, negative correlation of -0.40.
This means that on average, states
with right-to-work laws tend to
have lower median family incomes.
Schultz then concluded from his
analysis that, "right-to-work laws
depress family incomes."
His conclusion is wrong and
serves as a depressing example of
how statistics are misunderstood or

twisted to support a political agenda.
Correlation only measures an associ-
ation between two variables. It tells
us nothing about one variable caus-
ing the other.
The number of boating acci-
dents per week and the number of
ice cream cones sold per week are
positively correlated, but boating
accidents do not cause people to
buy ice cream, and ice cream prob-
ably doesn't cause many boating
accidents. Instead, both of these
things happen to increase together
in warmer weeks.
Unions don't
necessarily cause
lower incomes.
Just as weather is lurking behind
the association between ice cream
sales and boating accidents, sev-
eral other variables could be lurk-
ing behind the negative correlation
between right-to-work laws and
median income. Education levels,
proportion of stay-at-home parents,
geographical location and countless
other factors could be the real causes
of the lower mean median incomes
in right-to-work states.
The debate over right-to-work
laws is important for society to
have, but this debate should be
grounded in solid reasoning instead
of heated rhetoric and bad statis-
tics. I have my own opinions on
right-to-work, but I have no idea
if such laws cause lower median
incomes, and neither does Schultz.

Rosenberg shouldn't write the
foreword to the Daily's book
TO THE DAILY:
As a former Daily sports editor, I am sur-
prised and disappointed to see that Michael
Rosenberg is writing the foreword to The Dai-
ly's book "Michigan Football, from the pages
of The Michigan Daily." Rosenberg proved
himself to be a biased reporter in the way he
covered Michigan Football from 2008 to 2010.
"Three and Out," a best-selling book authored
by University lecturer John U. Bacon, details
Rosenberg's biases toward the program. These

biases ultimately caused a scandal regarding
the team stretching too much (in the book,
when he is asked about this, he starts crying).
Rosenberg is, quite literally, the last person
that should be writing this. Someone less con-
troversial andmore deservingofthishonor,like
former Daily editor Mike Wallace or maybe a
star player like Charles Woodson, should have
written the foreword. Dhani Jones, a former
Daily staffer and star on a national title team,
also would have been perfect for a project like
this.

CAPS offers scheduled
appointments for students who
do not require immediate care
but would still like to talk with a
therapist. Drop-in therapygroups
are also available, as well as crisis
intervention services.
In addition to scheduled
appointments, Sevig said CAPS
also offers same-day walk-in
care for individuals who require
immediate psychological assis-
tance during their business
hours.
In addition to CAPS' many pro-
active education and prevention
programs, Sevig said CAPS staff
has trained more than 3,000 stu-
dents, faculty and staff to notice if
their peers begin to demonstrate
mental health issues through the
Question Persuade Refer pro-
gram. The program educates
people on how to respond to situ-
ations in which an individual has
suicidal thoughts.
Though he encouraged indi-
viduals to become trained in QPR,
he stressed that those who are not
QPR-trained can still follow the
general tenets.
"The first thing is to take time
to talk with the person and to
listen," Sevig said. "The second
thing is to say, 'Gee, I'm wonder-
ing, are you thinking about hurt-
ing yourself?' And then, the third
thing is to persuade that person to
get help."
Sevig encouraged friends and
professors who are concerned
about an individual to personally
help them through the process by
referring the student to CAPS.
UMHS PSYCHIATRIC
EMERGENCY SERVICE
ASSISTS DURING
EMERGENCIES
Much like the University
Hospital's emergency room, the
University of Michigan Health
System Psychiatric Emergency
Service serves as an emergency
center for individuals experi-
encing mental health issues that
require urgent attention.
Rachel Glick, medical director
of the UMHS PES, said the ser-
vice - which is located near the

UMHS medical ER - is staffed
with about 70 mental health
professionals, including psychia-
trists, social workers, nurses and
medical assistants and is open 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
Glick said patients who initially
enter the medical ER are often
referred to PES if their symptoms
are psychiatric in nature.
Though individuals may be
confused as to when they should
come to PES as opposed to
CAPS or another mental health
resource on campus, Glick said
those who notice "significant
suicidal thinking or behavior"
or behavior "that is out of the
ordinary, unusual or poten-
tially dangerous" should visit
PES for treatment. The service's
24/7 hours makes it particularly
resourceful for individuals who
might have walked into CAPS for
an urgent appointment during
business hours.
Like CAPS, Glick said PES staff
members also assess a significant
number of individuals who are
experiencing a crisis, meaning
that they may not have expressed
suicidal thoughts,but desireguid-
ance as to whatthey can doto pre-
vent depression or other disorders
from progressing.
When a person enters PES,
Glick said they're immediately
triaged by a team of nurses and
medical assistants who deter-
mine their mental health status.
Subsequently, a clinician, usually
a social worker, spends time with
the patient to assess their history
and specific symptoms in order
to develop a plan of treatment.
Lastly, a psychiatrist briefly dis-
cusses drug treatment options
with the patient.
PES is one of only a few psy-
chiatric emergency rooms in the
state, according to Glick. She
said a large number of patients
requiring treatment for behav-
ioral issues end up in medical
emergency rooms.
"Even if a hospital doesn't
have a dedicated psychiatric
emergency service, they're still
getting patients who are hav-
ing these kinds of emergencies,"
Glick said. "They're just taking
care of them in the medical emer-
gency world."
PES also operates a 24-hour
crisis line - featuring psychi-
atric evaluation and treatment
recommendations according to
the PES website - which can be
reached at (734) 996-4747.
Glick said PES is just one part
of a large network of mental
health facilities on campus.

"I see us as sort of an integral
part of a whole system to support
our whole community," Glick
said.
UHS ALSO OFFERS
AN ARRAY OF MENTAL
HEALTH SERVICES
The University Health Service
also offers several psychological
and psychiatric services. Robert
Winfield, the University's chief
health officer and director of
UHS, said if a student, staff or
faculty member is certain they
are in psychological distress,
they should first look to facili-
ties such as CAPS or the PES ER,
whose primary mission is to treat
students for psychological issues.
However, he emphasized that if
a person in distress does come to
UHS, the clinic's staff is capable
of assisting them.
Winfield said without an
appointment, an individual in
distress may be seen by a UHS
nurse practitioner, who will
assess their needs and direct
them toward the appropri-
ate services, whether that be a
referral to CAPS, UHS's part-
time psychiatrist or the UMHS
PES.
Winfield added that if UHS
providers can prescribe psychi-
atric medication if they deem it
appropriate, such as when a stu-
dent has run out of medication
or believes that a medication will
resolve his or her problem. If a
person's mental health issues are
not severe, Winfield said UHS
clinicians may even be able to
treat the patient in-house.
"Health Service is one
resource, but not the first
resource for people that are very
depressed," Winfield said.
He added: "It's an alternative
resource, which will typically
not have the level of expertise
for somebody who is severely
depressed, but can help people
who have less severe difficulties."
What might be most notice-
able to students who visit UHS
is the implementation of two
patient questionnaires that were
launched in August. Individu-
als who visit the UHS walk-in
clinic are now asked to fill out the
PHQ-9 questionnaire, a widely
used test that assesses an indi-
vidual's level of depression, in
addition to an audit that screens
for alcohol abuse.
If an individual scores high
on either the 27-point depres-
sion questionnaire or the alcohol
audit, Winfield said UHS staff

members work directly with the
patient to provide them with the
necessary resources to resolve
possible problems.
"We are very pleased with
the work we've been doing on
this because we have identified
a good number of students who
had not come in just to seek help
just for psychological or alcohol
issues, but we were able to iden-
tify these and reach out to them,"
Winfield said.
Between Aug. 22, 2011 and
Nov.22, 2011, Winfield said about
6,000 patients took the PHQ-9
questionnaire. He said 0.6 per-
cent of the patients were deemed
to be severely depressed, 1.5
percent were suspected to have
moderately severe depression,
4 percent scored as moderately
depressed and 11 percent scored
as mildly depressed. If a patient
scores as moderately severe or
severe, UHS social workers aid
the individual in gaining access
to the necessary resources to
treat their depression.
WEBSITE SERVES
AS PORTAL FOR
INFORMATION ON
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES
The University also hosts a
website that specifically helps
students with ongoing health
disorders called Campus Mind
Works.
Stephanie Salazar, project
coordinator for Campus Mind
Works, said the site is a portal of
information for students on how
to manage their disorder while
studying at the University.
"Everything on there is really
focused on that student with the
ongoing health disorder and how
to navigate through the Univer-
sity," Salazar said. "And we also
have information about what
to do if you're hospitalized, and
what the process is to get back
into school and what resources
are available to you."
According to Salazar, the site
also works with the College of
Engineering and the Universi-
ty's Psychological Clinic to pro-
vide free education and support
groups for students on campus.
Salazar said prevention and
education are crucial in proac-
tively monitoring the campus
community for mental health
issues.
"Obviously, prevention is
important when we're talking
about mental health because it's
so much easier to tackle a prob-
lem before it gets really bad,"

Salazar said.
She added that when the site
was being developed, many stu-
dents surveyed were unaware
of the options they had in tak-
ing a semester leave, dropping
classes or reducing their work-
load. According to the academic
section of the website, students
with certain mental health dis-
orders can request a, waiver
from the University's Services
for Students Disabilities, which
will state that they are taking a
reduced course load but should
still be recognized as a full-time
student.

Campus Mind Works also has
resources for parents who may
be concerned about their stu-
dent's mental health. Salazar
said the information is intended
to give parents an overview of
how they can effectively support
their children.
"(There is) some informa-
tion about what parents can do
to support their student's men-
tal health because I know a lot
of parents have trouble sort of
navigating both being support-
ive but not overbearing especial-
ly if their student is away from
home," Salazar said.


COMPLIANCE
From Page 1A
they've changed how many peo-
ple have to disclose (conflict of
interest information), (and) the
time in which you have to dis-
close."
Pollack said the University
consulted with peer institu-
tions on how to minimize costs
accrued by the new regulations,
and it chose to focus on human
resources rather than expensive
software systems to comply with
federal guidelines.
"Originally, we were going to
put in place some permanent staff
positions, but what we learned
based on other people's experi-
ence with workflow was that after
a year or two, things settled out,
so we can budget for some term-
limited positions," Pollack said.
Pollack emphasized that
despite NIH's focus on conflict
of interest information in the
most recent update to the federal
guidelines, managed conflicts of
interest pose no issue for the Uni-
versity.
"Conflicts of interest in (them-
selves are) not a bad thing. A bad
thing is having a conflict of inter-
est that's not managed," Pollack
said. "You have to disclose it and
make sure it's properly managed,
or if it can't be managed, that you
don't act on it."
According to a University
report released last Friday, a snap-
shot of projects on Feb. 9 revealed
that more than 5,200 projects at

the University are under reviewby
the Institutional Review Boards,
one of the leading compliance
oversight bodies in University
research which monitors research
activities and protocols to be sure
they meet regulations and ethical
standards. More than 4,000 of the
projects are medically related, and
they often require the strictest
oversight.
Judy Nowack, associate vice
president for research at the Uni-
versity, said despite the new regu-
lations, the University has tried to
increase the IRBs' responsiveness
to project petitions from faculty.
Many non-medical projects are
now exempt from the formal proj-
ects review or subject to an "expe-
dited review." In 2011, fewer than
four new non-medical proposals
went before a full IRB committee
for review each month.
"We're trying to take low risk
determinations to educated staff,
rather than taking faculty time
to do it," Nowack said. "It's all a
balance. We do it; we look at the
effect ... We don't want to increase
risk in the system."
Nowack added that the Univer-
sity's Office of Human Research
Compliance Review independent-
ly oversees and educates the IRBs
and faculty on protocols and com-
pliance issues at the University.
According to Nowack,the OHRCR
also conducts surveys to measure
risk in the research system.
"We do subscribe that we pro-
vide protection to vulnerable
groups," Nowack said. "Our fac-
ulty members pretty well realize

that if somebody gives us a bad
reputation in the community,
where we draw our subjects, then
their own research is going to suf-
fer."
Nowack added that violations
of compliance issues within the
research unit seldom require
direct response from the OHRCR.
"It's very rare that we get really
serious things that come all the
way up to the top," Nowack said.
"We try to keep our fingers on the
pulse."
Fiona Linn, senior policy and
projects adviser in the Office of
the Vice President and General
Counsel, said the University has
not followed in the footsteps of
many peer institutions in cen-
tralizing compliance operations
under one office. She added that
the complexity and large variety

of University compliance opera-
tions prevented the University
from pursuing that route.
"We made a deliberate choice
at U of M not to centralize all of
the compliance functions, which
a number of universities have
done," Linn said. "They've done it
following a very corporate model
in which you have one senior vice
president or similar role (who) is
responsible for all issues in com-
pliance."
Linn helped oversee the cre-
ation of the Compliance Resource
Center website, which is available
for University students and staff.
It currently serves as a launch-
ing point and information clear-
inghouse for compliance issues
that allows users to access more
detailed information and contacts.

said. "Previously, you had people in disclosing grades and finan-

Report: Burke to
enter NBA Draft

Why you shouldn't hate Trey Burke

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
According to multiple reports,
freshman point guard Trey
Burke has decided to forgo the
remainder of his basketball
career at Michigan and will
enter the upcoming NBA Draft.
CBS Sports was the first to
report the news about Burke's
departure on Wednesday. The
Detroit Free Press - which was
the first to report Burke's plan to
inquire about his draft prospects
two weeks ago, citing his father,
Benji - later reported that Burke
met with Michigan coach John
Beilein on Monday.
If the reports prove true, this
marks the second consecutive
year that the Wolverines will
enter an offseason with a void at
point guard following an under-
classman starter bolting for the
NBA.
Last season, Darius Morris
left after his sophomore season
and was drafted in the second
round by the Los Angeles Lak-
ers.
Word of Burke's decision
quickly spread across the Inter-
net, prompting Burke's family to
respond.
"Trey Burke has not declared
for the NBA draft. He is still
enrolled at the University
of Michigan," Benji tweeted
Wednesday afternoon.
But even if Burke has made up
his mind and informed coaches
of his intentions, the freshman
won't be expected to declare
within the next few days.
This year, the NCAA has
attemnterd to reo-ulate NBA

Draft declarations by imposing
an April 10 deadline - 19 days
before the NBA-mandated April
29 deadline for players to declare
for the draft - for athletes who
have officially declared for the
NBA to withdraw their names
and return to school before the
June 28 draft.
But the April 10 deadline leaves
itself susceptible to a loophole.
Should Burke officially declare
any time before April 10, he must
pull by out by that date in order
to be eligible to return to college.
But he could choose to wait until
after the NCAA's deadline, and as
long as he declares before April
29, he'd still be eligible for the
draft. This leaves additional time
to further gather information or
allow time for a possible change
of heart.
Even if Burke would chose
to return, Michigan would still
have a void at point guard -
albeit, in the backup role.
This year, senior guard Stu
Douglass slid over from his
shooting guard role to run the
point when Burke was on the
bench.
But Douglass's eligibility in
Ann Arbor has expired. Addi-
tionally, freshman guard Carl-
ton Brundidge - one of only
two remaining Wolverines with
any experience at point guard -
chose to transfer after the sea-
son ended.
In his first year as a Wol-
verine, Burke led Michigan in
points, assists, steals, blocks,
minutes played and 3-point
makes. Burke is given much of
the credit for the program's first
conference title since 1986.

Take all the expectations
you might've had regard-
ing next year's Michigan
men's basketball team and throw
them as vigorously as you can at
something hard, so they explode
into a million little pieces.
Admire the pieces of what
was to be
a surefire
top-10 team
next year for
a moment,
then sweep
them up and
trash them.
But don't
trash Trey DANIEL
Burke. W WASSERMAN
Just15
days ago, in
an interview with Burke's father
Benji, the Detroit Free Press
reported that the point guard
was inquiring about his NBA
Draft stock and leaning toward
going pro.
After an initial panic, most
fans stepped back from the pro-
verbial cliff after realizing that
no matter how good of a season
Burke had, his 5-foot-11 frame
wasn't going to grow three inch-
es into a first-round pick over the
next few weeks. Almost every
draft analyst gave the freshman
a possible late second-round
grade but said he'd most likely go
undrafted.
And then came two eye-open-
ing projected rankings forthe
2012-13 season.
On Tuesday, ESPN's Andy
Katz pegged Michigan at No.
8, but warned that it "might
change by Thursday." Later that
day, CBS Sports' Jeff Goodman
and Gary Parrish tabbed the
Wolverines at No. 5.
But at 2:57 p.m. on Wednes-
day - less than 24 hours after
his ranlinworep- u bnlished -

Goodman announced via Twit-
ter that he had "some HUGE
news." Moments later, he broke
the story that Burke is planning
to depart Michigan after his
freshman season. And boom.
Just like that, Michigan fans
bolted for the cliff and jumped
without ever looking back.
Even with key departures,
including Zack Novak, Stu Dou-
glass and Evan Smotrycz, the
Wolverines were going tobe
good. How good? A lot of that
depended on how the most tal-
ented recruiting class coming to
Ann Arbor since the Fab Five II
class of 1994 would pan out.
Now we'll never know. And if
Michigan hopes to earn a 2611
NCAA Tournament bid, that
incoming class needs to add a
point guard. And even if it does,
the Wolverines just went from a
top-5 contender nationally to a
team that may fight to stay out of
the Big Ten's worst five teams.
Fans - the same ones who let
the basketball program go unno-
ticed for much of the last decade
- didn't like the taste of that.
They took to Twitter to call
Burke names. They took to mes-
sage boards to doubt that he'll
ever make it. They commented
on articles saying that his depar-
ture means that he isn't Michi-
gan material.
Nothing he hasn't heard
before, though. A year ago, the
casual Wolverine fan didn't even
know Burke's name. Two years
ago, he was a barely a Big Ten-
quality prospect, committing to
perennial bottom-feeder Penn
State. And three years ago, one
of the only schools to show him
interest was Ohio - ironically,
the same team that ended his
career at Michigan. Do I think
Burke should leave? No.
With another year under his

belt and the expected improve-
ments that typically accompany
added experience, his chances
of being drafted soar. Some top
draft analysts who project Burke
going undrafted this year label
him as a first-round pick in next
year's draft. No, he won't grow
from this year to next year, but
he won't shrink, either.
But to those trashing Burke, I
ask you this: What does he owe
you? A Big Ten Championship?
He already brought you that, and
almost single handedly at that.
After Darius Morris left follow-
ing last season, many wondered
how successfully John Beilein
could work around a void at
point guard. At even the mere
thought of Smotrycz and Tim
Hardaway Jr. struggling like
they did this season, it would've
been hard to project the Wol-
verines finishing above .500 in
conference play. But instead,
a level-headed Burke carried
Michigan through one of the
toughest schedules in the coun-
try. He led Michigan in nearly
every meaningful stat category,
including blocks - yes, blocks -
and in doing so, the Wolverines
won a conference that was wide-
ly considered the nation's best.
Does he owe you wins in the
future? No.. But what future
point-guard recruit wouldn't
want to play for Beilein, who has
sent point guards to the NBA in
back-to-back years? Yes, Burke
and Morris are both immensely
talented, but both saw mete-
oric rises in their stock in a very
short timeframe. Landing better
recruits typically equals more
wins. But none of that matters,
because Burke doesn't owe you,
me or the University anything
anymore.
The University gave him a
scholarship, which he more than

repaid for by bringing in fans to
fill the seats, retailers selling his
No. 3 jersey and all the addition-
al profits that come along with
a major Division I program that
just won a conference cham-
pionship. But why do we come
to school, anyways? The clich6
answer is for the degree - some-
thing Burke won't attain, at least
in the near future - but last I
checked, no one's end goal in life
is a college degree. We go to col-
lege to earn the degree that will
one day earn us a paycheck.
For more than 99.9 percent of
college students, the paycheck
we want to earn means we'll
need that degree. But not for
Burke. Last year's final draft
selection, Isaiah Thomas, earned
$473,604 this year and is due
for $762,195 next season. Even
top-of-the-class Ross Business
School students wouldn't dream
of entrance-level salaries like
that. And if he goes undrafted
and is forced to test European-
league waters, a six-figure sti-
pend is still headed his way.
It's easy to bash Burke. The
move seems rushed and impul-
sive - exactly the opposite of
the uncanny composure Burke
displayed for a freshman on the
court. But Burke is a good kid,
lacking the ego and immaturity
that too many young athletes
possess these days. Off the court,
he's humble, and genuine. And I
trust his decision incorporated
all of those attributes.
Right or wrong, it doesn't
matter. And if you disagree with
Burke, he still doesn't owe you
anything, because in just a few
months, the team lucky enough
to get Burke will owe him a big
sum of money.

Michigan snaps four-game slide

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Matt Trowbridge and Central
Michigan's defense was just what
the doctor ordered for the Michi-
gan baseball team's offense.
The Wolverines (0-3 Big
Ten, 13-16 overall) capitalized
on erratic pitching and sloppy
defense
from their CMU 3
opponent MICHIGAN 7
to score
five first-inning runs, defeating
the Chippewas,7-3, and snapping
a four-game losing streak.
"Ifyouwant to put pressure on
them, you've got to put the ball in
play," said Michigan coach Rich
Maloney. "Once we put a little
pressure (on Central Michigan),
we got the timely hits, and that
was the difference in the game."
Before the matchup against
Central Michigan (3-3 MAC,
12-17overall),theWolverineshad
struggled to produce runs. Dur-
ing its four previous contests, the
offense had averaged just three
runs per game. Though Michi-
gan managed just five hits in yes-
terday's game, it benefitted from
multiple miscues by the Chippe-
was. Trowbridge's control issues
were apparent from the first bat-
ter he faced. He led off the bot-
tom of the first inningbywalking
junior center fielder Patrick
Biondi and freshman shortstop
Dylan Delany. After both players
advanced a base on a wild pitch,
sophomore right fielder Michael
O'Neill reached base on an error
by Central Michigan's shortstop
Jordan Dean, scoring Biondi to
tie the game at 1-1.
Freshman left fielder Will
Drake then singled to send home
Delaney and give the Wolverines
a lead they wouldn't relinquish
for the rest of the game. Sopho-
more catcher Cole Martin con-
cluded the first-inning scoring
with a two-run single through
the left side of the infield.
Trowbridge was yanked after
only one inning. He allowed just

two hits, but walked four bat-
ters, threw two wild pitches and
allowed four earned runs. He
also walked in a run.
"I thought Will Drake and that
hit early was important," Malo-
ney said. "I thought our guys
were patient, which was impor-
tant. I thought Cole Martin's
two-run hit was huge because we
haven't gotten too many of those
lately."
Those five runs proved to be
enough, as Michigan's pitching
staff held the Chippewas to three
runs. Freshman hurler James
Bourque, who was tagged for
four runs in 3.1 innings in a 12-2
defeat against Eastern Michigan
last Wednesday, earned his sec-
ond career victory. After relin-
quishing a first-inning home run
to Dean, he settled down to pitch
three solid innings, allowing two
hits and only one earned run
while striking out three batters.
"I kind of just forgot about (the.

home run)," Bourque said. "I was
happy with the leadoff hitter that
inning, and then I came back and
got the next guy. And then in the
second inning, I cruised pretty
well. I just had to let itgo."
Central Michigan had plen-
ty of opportunities to mount a
comeback against the bullpen.
After scoring two runs in the top
of the fifth inning with a two-out
rally against senior right-hander
Kevin Vangheluwe, the Chippe-
was left the bases loaded in the
sixth and eighth innings. In both
frames, they failed to drive home
a run against sophomore hurler
Alex Lakatos. In the sixth inning,
Dean - who entered the contest
batting .376 - grounded into a
double play to end the stanza,
and in the eighth inning, Dean
flew out to right field for the final
out. Central Michigan left a total
of 11 men on base for the game.
It appeared that Michigan
would have a field day against

the Central Michigan pitching
staff after its first-inning perfor-
mance, but the Wolverine bats
reverted back to their usual ways
and grew silent for most of the
game. Senior first baseman Coley
Crank tallied the Wolverines'
only extra-base hit of the day
when he smacked his sixth home
run of the season over the left-
center-field wall in the bottom of
the fifth inning.
"I had two strikes, so I was just
looking for a ball in the zone,"
Crank said. "(Central Michigan's
Dylan Rheault) threw a high
slider, and so I had to protect (the
plate)."
Though the offense has strug-
gled at the plate as of late, Crank
was encouraged by its perfor-
mance against the Chippewas.
"The last few games haven't
been too great, but we put it
behind us and came out ready to
play, and we got good results,"
Crank said.

Michigan women's basketball
coach Kevin Borseth announced
his resignation at a meeting
Wednesday afternoon with the
team and coaching staff. He will
return to Wisconsin-Green Bay,
where he spent nine years as the
head coach before coming to Ann
Arbor.
"I have decided to resign my
position and return to Wisconsin-
Green Bay as head coach," Bors-
eth said in a press release through
the Michigan Athletic Depart-
ment. "My family and I have
really enjoyed
our time at_
Michigan. We
have made "(W e)
some terrific
friends, and enjoyed
we will miss
everybody. at M ic]
would like to
thank everyone
at the Univer-
sity of Michigan for giving me
this opportunity to be the wom-
en's basketball coach, and I wish
everyone the best in the future."
Borseth had just completed his
best season with the Wolverines,
finishing the 2011-12 campaign
with a 20-12 overall record and
a seventh-place Big Ten finish,
going 8-8 in the conference.
Michigan also earned an at-
large bid to the NCAA Tour-
nament, its first in 11 years.
Oklahoma knocked out the 11th-
seeded Wolverines in the first
round. The resignation came as
a shock to the players, who were
unaware of the situation before
the meeting.
"Absolutely speechless. Can't
control my emotions right now ...

wow," junior forward Sam Arnold
tweeted after the meeting.
In his five years at the helm,
Borseth recorded an 87-73 overall
record and a 38-48 Big Ten mark,
making three WNIT appearanc-
es and one NCAA Tournament
appearance. He also put together
a pair of 20-win seasons during
his tenure. In his previous stint
at Wisconsin-Green Bay, Borseth
found more success. The Phoenix
never missed the postseason in
his nine years - including seven
trips to the NCAA Tournament -
and won the regular-season con-
ference title each year. Borseth
compiled a 216-62 record, going
125-13 in con-
ference play.
"My fam-
really ily and I are
so thrilled to
our time return to Green
Bay and to the
higan. many friends
and fans in the
community,"
Borseth said
in a statement on the Wisconsin-
GreenBayathletics website."Iam
really excited to get to know the
current players on the team and
to continue to move Green Bay
women's basketball forward."
Wisconsin-Green Bay will hold
a press conference Thursday at
3:30 p.m., officially announcing
Borseth's return to the women's
basketball program. The Phoenix
made an appearance in the NCAA
Tournament last season, earning
a seven-seed after going 31-2 in
the regular season and winning
the Horizon League Tournament.
The team lost to two-seed Ken-
tucky in the second round.
Borseth replaces Matt Bollant,
who recently tookthe head coach-
ing job at Illinois.

THE EVOLUTION OF
By Jacob Axelrad, Senior Arts Editor


Rock and roll emerged as a reflection and
as an expression of the economic and
technological changes taking place in
western civilization, it was no accident, it
was the precisely perfect manifestation
of the tremendous changes going down
throughout the western world.
- John Sinclair, "Guitar Army: Street Writ-
ings /Prison Writings."


A man observes audience members from behind
a projector in the University's Art & Architec-
ture Auditorium as they watch excerpts from
the movies he has come to screen at the fourth
annual Ann ArborFilm Festival: "Vinyl," "Lupe"

and "14 Year Old Girl."
The films are experimental, cutting-edge
examples of what he terms "neo primitive real-
ism." And the audience doesn't know how to
react to scenes of the grotesque, such as a boy
being tortured just because he enjoys reading
books.
Some critics might have called the young

filmmaker avant-garde. But in an interview
with The Michigan Daily at the time, the artist,
named Andy Warhol, didn't seem to find any-
thing odd about the films he'd chosen to pres-
ent.
"I didn't think these films were unusual, they
were just very humorous," Warhol said.
Before John Sinclair was ever arrested and

sentenced to 10 years in prison for possession of
two marijuana joints, before John Lennon and
Yoko Ono came to town to rally for Sinclair's
freedom, and before Hash Bash left its legacy
as the embodiment of the hippie movement and
counterculture here in Ann Arbor, there was
Andy Warhol, the Velvet Underground and a
tradition of festivals that ignited a generation.


"Well, they certainly
weren't bored."
- Andy Warhol,
commenting on the audience's
reception of his movies.


Organized by the University's Cinema Guild,
the Dramatic Arts Center of Ann Arbor and
Detroit's American Civil Liberties Union, the
Ann Arbor Film Festival - then in its fourth
year - wanted to continue its tradition of off-
beat cinema, the kind that still distinguishes the
festival to this day.
They looked to Andy Warhol, the luminary
of the pop art movement; his 16-millimeter film
projections were exactly the sort of thing the fes-
tival wanted.
But there was a catch. Warhol would only
come if he could bring his band, the Velvet
Underground. After all, they were a team. They
relied on each other for their traveling show, the
Exploding Plastic Inevitable.
"Apparently, Andy said, 'Sure, I'll come, but
you have to let me bring my band with me,' "said
American Culture Prof Bruce Conforth. "So of
course they agreed, and they come, and they do
the concert."
The Velvet Underground's performance
was something wholly new to the town of Ann
Arbor. They were not the Beatles or the Rolling

Stones. Nor were these guys your typical light-
hearted fare from San Francisco, Conforth said.
Their music was gritty, urban, like the sounds
of New York City transplanted to the Midwest.
More importantly, they were bringing what
would later be called "punk rock" right to the
steps of the University campus.
"Here come the Velvet Underground singing
about something that was diametrically oppo-
site from what the love generation was experi-
encing," Conforth said. "So, they get out there,
and their music was very drone-like. It was very,
very simple. Very basic. Very much like what
punk would ultimately become, ya' know, with
the basis very easily on that three-chord for-
mula."
The audience thatthe Velvets appealed to back
in March of '66 wasn't just composed of college
students. Two future musicians were in atten-
dance that day: Iggy Pop and Wayne Kramer.
"(Iggy Pop and Wayne Kramer) have com-
mented that - largely on the basis of what they
experienced that night - it led them to want to
get into music," Conforth said. "I mean, basically

Iggy created Iggy Pop and the Stooges based on
what he had seen from that concert.
"They were influenced all the way around.
They saw this and said 'That's what I want to
do. I want to be a rock 'n' roll musician ... I don't
want to just be a Beatles clone. I want to do
something that's very different, too.'"
While Iggy Pop would go on to found Iggy
and the Stooges, Kramer stayed closer to Ann
Arbor. He subsequently joined the Detroit-
based MC5, a band that was, for a time, man-
aged by John Sinclair himself.
Though Sinclair is perhaps best known for
his radical political affiliations - he was the
founder of the anti-racist White Panther Party
and the namesake for the 1971 John Sinclair
Freedom Rally, which spurred the tradition of
Hash Bash - he was first and foremost an artist
and poet who devoted himself to Ann Arbor's
music scene.
But at the time, concerts were not unusual.
Big-name artists like the Velvet Underground
had already been comingto Ann Arbor for some
time.

So, on Dec. 10, 1971, the date of the famed
Freedom Rally - when acts such as Commander
Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen, Stevie Won-
der and Allen Ginsberg came out to perform
at Crisler Arena in support of Sinclair after his
arrest - John Lennon and political fervor were
what made the concert unique.
"Concerts like that were promotions," Sinclair
said in a phone interview. "You hired the acts,
and promoters made a lot of money. Show busi-
ness. What we did (with the Freedom Rally) was
a political act. Everybody did that for nothing."
Conforth agreed, but he also asserted that the
context from which the Freedom Rally emerged
should not be ignored.
"There was precedent for that many artists
coming to (Ann Arbor)," Conforth said. "Hav-
ing a Beatle there changes everything. But still,
if you took John Lennon (and) political speeches
out of the event and just had the artists, it would
have been just another big concert at Ann Arbor."
As fortune would have it, "just another con-
cert" was what was in store for John Sinclair.

In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"1776"
As you're starting (maybe?) to crack open those
books and study for your history class finals, there
is one musical you need to incorporate into your
study regimen: "1776." There's nothing quite like
watching the American forefathers sing, dance
and fight each other with walking sticks. And
never forget: There's more to life than sexual com-
bustibility.
COLUMBIA
The Campfire Headphase
- Boards of Canada
The focused, ambient soundscapes that Boards
of Canada creates are a great accompaniment to
the end of the semester. With its organic take on
electronic music, The Campfire Headphase is the
perfect album for lazy summer-like days spent
outside as well as those spent trapped in the
library.
WARP
"Spirited Away"
As the year winds down and the flood of anxi-
eties over future internships, classes and life
plans is unleashed, why not reach for a film that
will keep you young at heart? Hayao Miyazaki's
"Spirited Away" is the antidote to even the worst
case of the "grown-up blues," combining a daz-
zling story about finding yourself while finding
a way home with breathtakingly detailed anima-
" > tion.
DISNEY
"Psyc h"
If you're in the mood for a wisecrackingcomedy
that never takes itself too seriously, "Psych" is the
showfor you. Sure, the storylines may be cliche
and over-the-top, hut what "Psych" lacks in plot
originality, it more than makes up for in obscure
pop-culture references and zany slapstick humor.
Snappy dialogue, an unparalleled supporting cast
and a concedingly charming leading man gives
"Psych" something for everyone.

Arleen Cosack
Stairway to Heaven owner
What are your thoughts about Hash Bash?
It's a lot of energy, mainly good energy. I like it, and we definitely
do very well.
What are some unique items in the store?
We do specialize in pink because a lot of girls do come in here.
People like unusual ones, and we do have certain glassblowers who
only blow for us in Michigan, so that's cool.
Any interesting Hash Bash memories as a store owner?
I remember one girl gave me a flower, which I liked, and another
girl gave me a bumper sticker about stereotypes.

its architecture is unassuming -

to the 1950s-diner-style vinyl
booths and barstools. An eclec-
tic melange of original artwork
hangsbetween the windows, and
a shelf of nondescript baseball
trophies leers from above.
This eccentric backdrop sets
the scene for the hustle and
bustle of the Angelo's experience.
The waitstaff is perpetually in a
hurried shuffle from one end of
the room to the other. Bowls and
glasses clang together in busboys'
buckets, silverware is heard strik-

plates, and customers' orders
successively collide with the
stainless-steel counter connect-

Voices compete with one another,
rising in intensity as families, col-

HASH BASH
From Page 1B
"All in all ... it was a powerful
festivalithat Sinclair's legions
staged. It churned up a lot of
bread for the alternate com-
munity around Ann Arbor
and showed what canbe done
once people settle down and
get organized. The Rainbow
people are beautiful."- Rich-
ard Nusser, from "The Wood-
stock Nation at Ann Arbor,"
published in the Village Voice
on Sept.28,1972.
Eventually, the Michigan
Supreme Court overturned the
ruling against Sinclair, and he was
released from prison in Decem-
ber of 1971. Upon his release, he
received a phone call. It was his
old friend Peter Andrews, one of
the producers of the John Sinclair
Freedom Rally. He was working
for the University's Major Events
Office and wanted John to assist
him in organizing the Ann Arbor
Blues and Jazz Festival.
The festival began in 1969, and
according to a 1972 article from
The Ann Arbor News, it was a
financial failure that was revived
three years later under "new
direction and expanded empha-
sis." That new direction was Sin-
clair's nonprofit organization,
Rainbow Multi-Media Corpora-
tion.
As a festival co-producer,
Sinclair helped to handpick the
lineup, which consisted of some
of the most notable names in jazz
at the time: Howlin' Wolf, Muddy
Waters, Archie Shepp, Freddie
King, Otis Rush, Pharoah Sanders
and Miles Davis, to name a few.
"We were trying to produce
events and carry on music in the
music business," Sinclair said.
"We also produced free concerts
in the park. They were a means
of producing things and making
things happen without being con-
cerned about anyone making a lot

of money or any money at all."
The festival lasted for three
days. And for three days, as many
as 16,000 attendees filled the
grass of the Otis Spann Memorial
Field for what was, by definition,
an event for the people.
"The thing that's gonna make
the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz
Festival different from any other
festival is that it's gonna be a real
people's festival - produced by
freaks and for the community,"
Sinclair was quoted as saying in
a Rolling Stone article from 1972.
Sinclair further explained that
all proceeds from the festival
were used to promote "self-help
and self-determination projects
here inAnn Arbor."
"(People) had the opportunity
to pay and have the money go to
the artists," Sinclair said.
"Dope is marijuana, LSD,
peyote, mescaline, psilocybin,
sacred mushrooms, hashish,
DMT, nitrous oxide, and other
beautiful chemical substances
that make you feel good with-
outhurting you." - John
Sinclair, "Guitar Army: Street
Writings/PrisonWritings."
Today, the Ann Arbor Film
Festival persists, and musicians
come to Hill Auditorium every
year for the Ann Arbor Folk Fes-
tival, though in far smaller num-
bers than the 1972 Blues and Jazz
Festival. And Sinclair's legacy is
still celebrated annually, as pro-
testers loudly voice their beliefs
on the Diag for an hour on the
first Saturday of every April.
Festivities follow at the Monroe
Street Fair, colloquially known as
Hash Bash.
Why has Hash Bash persisted?
In Sinclair's view, it's an oppor-
tunity to have a good time, much
like the festivals that surrounded
the original Freedom Rally. And,
he believes Hash Bash would con-
tinue even if recreational marijua-
na were to be legalized.
"It'd be a celebratory occa-

sion, then, wouldn't it?" Sinclair
said with a laugh over the phone.
"We'd have even more fun. You
could just smoke a joint out there
without worrying about the thugs
from the University Police riding
down on you."
However, according to DPS
spokeswoman Diane Brown,
Hash Bash doesn't generate con-
troversy as it once did. Citing
statistics from the past decade,
Brown explained that the number
of arrests made by DPS has signif-
icantly decreased in recent years.
1999's Hash Bash saw 74
arrests. In 2000, that number
decreased to 56. And by 2007,
there were no arrests, "and (the
protesters) left before 1 o'clock
even gotthere," Brown said.
Brown said the recent legal-
ization of medicinal marijuana
played a part in attracting more
visitors than the event had seen
in recent history, and she noted.
that their actions were primarily
benign.
"(The number of people)
inched back up partly because of
the medicinal marijuana issue, so
its low last year was somewhere in
the 6,000 range, maybe," Brown
said. "But it was aO6,000 that came
and then left at (1 o'clock) rather
than (staying) all afternoon and
into the evening, which is what
used to happen."
This isn't to say the protests
have stopped. They haven't. But
the methods and forms have
changed. And in today's Ann
Arbor, an event like Hash Bash
seems to be exactly that - an
event, a time for momentary cel-
ebration.
The actual protesting occurs on
a quieter level.
LSA junior Sebastian Swae-
Shampine, the assistant executive
director for Students for Sensible
Drug Policy, said the the Universi-
ty's official stance toward medici-
nal marijuana, in his opinion,
doesn't make sense.
"I think it's pretty absurd that
someone can have a bottle of

Vicodin on the Diag and pop one
of those and that's OK, but they
can't even possess - not even con-
sume - they just can't even have
their state-sanctioned medicine
on them," he said.
SSDP - astudent-runorganiza-
tion that's part of an international
network with over 140 chapters
- fosters discussion about drug
policies at the grassroots level.
But Swae-Shampine explained
that the organization "does not
endorse or condone drug use in
any way, shape or form." Its role
is to foster discussion about drug
policy, which he believes is not as
widely accepted as it could be.
When it comes to Hash Bash,
however, SSDP maintains a safe
distance from the message put
forth bythe annual protesters.
"We're definitely going to be
there. We support it, you know,
as what it is and as a celebra-
tion of culture," he said. "But it's
just unprofessional for a reform
organization to be like, 'free the
weed!"
Sinclair, a state-registered
medicinal marijuana patient, con-
tinues to return every April to
smoke a joint and see old friends
- not to re-experience the past or
to put forward a political agenda,
but to live in the present.
He says he'll keep coming back
as long as Hash Bash continues,
even if it's only a time for people
to express themselves the way he
feels they should.
"What else is it supposed to
be about?" he asked. "It's just an
hour for one day a year. It's just
a thing. But I'm happy they still
have it because it's good for people
to express themselves like that, I
believe. It doesn't happen enough
in today's world."
As Warhol noted during his
Film Festival visit back in '66, art-
ists have never really needed a
reason to express themselves in
Ann Arbor. The act of expression
is enough.

BLOasN AWAY
Glass pipes are a hot commodity in A2

Close-knit artisan
community keeps
craft ablaze
By ELLIOT ALPERN
Senior Arts Editor
Matthew Ronayne steps into
his garage to begin production on
his latest work. He begins like any
other artist: He collects his tools,
gathers his pigments and turns up
the radio for some added focus. At
this point, however, he deviates
from where a painter might make
the first stroke, or where a sculp-
tor would make the first strike,
and instead ignites a torch - one
that will heat his particular can-
vas up to a red-hot 1,200 degrees
Fahrenheit.
Ronayne is a glass blower, a
member of the small community
of artisans that serves as the foun-
dation for Ann Arbor's glass-pipe
market.
Over the next half hour, he
will shape a glass tube about
the width of a clementine into
a single glass pipe. The process
has many steps: The glass must
be heated until glowing, at which
point it's pulled until the desired
width of the pipe stem (the body
of the pipe) is achieved. One end,
which will act as the "bowl,"
is sealed off, heated again and
blown into until a bubble forms.
A cone-shaped indentation is
then pressed into the bubble.
After just a few more adjust-
ments, a functional pipe is born.
The end result will become one
of the hundreds, if not thousands,
of glass pipes that will fill the

shelves of local shops in prepara-
tion for this weekend's Hash Bash.
"This industry ... it's only been
around for 10to 15 years, in terms
of the real artistic pieces," said
Patti King, operations manager
at 42 Degrees, a shop located in
downtown Ann Arbor that spe-
cializes in glass smoking devices.
"It keeps growing and grow-
ing every year ... because the art-
ists keep getting more elaborate
and better at what they do," King
added.
For Ronayne, who blows glass
pipes full-time as a means to sup-
port his wife and three kids, this
constant change in artistic form is
especially true.
"It's all evolution, from dayone,
to the piece I made six months ago,
(which) leads me to that piece I'm
going to make tonight or tomor-
row," Ronayne said. "You always
got to challenge yourself to push
it."
The evolvingtechniques can be
manifested in changes in features
(such as bumps or ridges), designs
(such as a skull or a flower within
the glass itself) or the shape of the
piece. This perpetual pursuit of
innovative development is facili-
tated by Ann Arbor's small, tight-
knit group of glass artists.
"It's a small world, the glass-
blowing community," said Paul
Plant, whoblows glass with fellow
artisan Steve Hoffman in a studio
just outside of downtown Ann
Arbor.
"Most Michigan glass blowers
know each other," Plant added.
Still, at a basic level, the glass-
pipe industry is just like any other.
Glass blowers must work tirelessly
to turn their artistry into a profit.

An individual blower can make
as many as 100 pipes in a week,
a testament to Michigan's high
demand for glass smoking devices.
Ronayne hasbeen crafting glass
pipes for about 16 years,buthe still
strives to maintain his passion in
the artwork, despite the pressures
of glass blowing asa career.
"You get lost in glass blowing;
it's still a backyard art in a way,"
Ronayne said. "You're not going
to go to school and find it; you just
kind of have to get lucky and stum-
ble on it ... and not that it gets old,
but it gets tiresome. It's all on you.
But if I didn't want to blow glass, I
wouldn't be blowing glass."
Thoughthe endresultis alarge-
scale production of small pieces of
artwork, the glass sculptures ulti-
mately do fulfill a practical pur-
pose - one that benefits from the
medium of glass itself.
"(Glass) is cleaner; it's safer; it's
not bad for you," said King, who
manages a selection of pipes that
consists almost entirely of glass-
work. "If you think about heating
up plastic or metal, there's tons of
chemicals in it. Basically, (with)
any other product other than glass
or a stone product, you're going to
be able to taste it. It's going to be
unhealthy whether you realize it
or not."
Aside from glass, other popu-
lar pipe materials include acrylic,
metal, wood, stone and any com-
bination therein. But, according
to Ronayne, glass is the ideal for
smokingdevices.
"You don't want to inhale any
of those things ... metal, especial-
ly," Ronayne said. "(Glass is best)
mainly for health, all the way. And
it's cool as hell - you're not going

to get a spectacular piece out of
metal."
And in using glass, the blowers
are able to make use of a material
not just for its properties as the
healthiest material for smoking,
but also for its ability to be ablank
canvas, a medium with unlimited
artistic potential.
King explained that the cre-
ative aspect of working with glass
makes those who sculpt with it
artists in their own right.
"I think it's a huge form of art-
istry - anyone who blows glass is
an artist," King said. "Most of the
artistswhoblowglass, ifyouknow
them personally, you can see that
in them ... you can see they're a
little eccentric.
"It's definitely, in my opinion,
one of the truest forms of art there

is - you have to have that ability
inside your mind to be able to cre-
ate somethinglike glass."
For some, that creative foun-
dation can lie dormant and make
itself known later in life.
"I never thought that I was
going to be an artist growing up,"
Hoffman said. "But this worked
out the best for me. I was a junior
at (the University) studying phi-
losophy and ethics, and I started
blowing glass. And I realized
that I can make a living doing
this and read all of the philoso-
phy I want."
However, though glass blowing
may appear to be an easy, fun way
to earn a living, it boasts a steep
learningcurve like any other form
of specialized sculpting.
"I watched for, like, three.

months before I would even
touch it, because I was learning,"
Ronayne said. "They make it look
really easy, but it's not as easy as
it's made to look. ... The fire's rag-
ing, and if you let the fire take you
and you want to be aggressive
with it, you're done."
But despite its difficulty and the
patience required to obtain the
right set of skills, blowing glass
pipes is a career unlike any other.
Like with any form of art, there is
no level of perfection for what you
can put in to your work.
"I don't know that I'll ever
achieve that (level), which is
great about glass," Ronayne said.
"(With) alot of jobs you have, you
see where your pinnacle will be.
With glass, that doesn't exist. It's
wide open ... it's endless."

somethingsavory to balance the
incredible sweetness, or even if
you don't, order a side of sausage

patties. They're made of the most
perfectly flavored, juicy and ten-
der breakfast meat I've ever had,
putting even Bob Evans' original
recipe to shame.
If you're feeling more like
lunch, though, anything with
bacon is the right decision. The

cured meat shatters in your
mouth likea perfectly fried potato
chip, never tough, chewy, dry
or burnt. The kitchen staff piles
it high on the sandwiches, so
feel free to slip a piece out for a
quick pregame before you dig in.
The BLT is a great go-to, but the

turkey club takes the sandwich
to a whole new level. Be sure to
specify that you want yours with
smoked turkey, and toasted, for
the ultimate meaty nosh. I like
a little more mayonnaise than
what's generally slathered on, but
I'm willing to accept that this is

maybe just a personal preference.
Basically, whatever you're in
the mood for, Angelo's has you
covered. The restaurant has
earned its title as an Ann Arbor

waiting outside leaves no doubt
that it's for good reason. The
