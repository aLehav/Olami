Richard 
Spencer, 
a 

prominent white nationalist 
who coined the term “alt-
right,” a movement promoting 
white 
supremacist 
ideals, 

announced public speaking 
engagements at the University 
of Michigan and Texas A&M 
University in a Washington 
Post profile last Tuesday, 
though 
the 
University 

confirmed he has not been 
formally 
invited 
by 
the 

University or student groups.

“I think there’s going to 

be a huge crowd,” Spencer 
said in the article about the 
appearance.

Throughout 
October 

and 
November, 
anti-Black, 

anti-Muslim, 
anti-women 

and 
anti-LGBTQ 
posters 

were found around campus 
featuring symbols associated 
with the alt-right movement, 
such as images of Pepe the 
Frog garbed in KKK robes 
and blackface. The meme 
was 
officially 
designated 

as a hate symbol by the 

Anti-Defamation 
League 

in 
late 
September. 
The 

posters 
spurred 
numerous 

protests, 
faculty-sponsored 

discussions 
on 
campus 

climate and a campus-wide 
anti-hate speech campaign, 
but the University was unable 
to locate anyone who put up 
the flyers.

Spencer — who heads a 

right-wing think tank called 
the National Policy Institute 
— told the Post he watched a 
video of about 1,000 students 
staging a walkout at the 
University two weeks ago and 
chanting, “No alt-right! No 
KKK! No racist USA!”

“We’re getting under their 

skin,” Spencer said. “I take a 
sadistic pleasure in that.”

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen denied any 
invitation 
extended 
from 

University-affiliated 
groups 

to Spencer.

“We 
do 
not 
have 
any 

confirmation of a student 
group (or groups) inviting Mr. 
Spencer to U-M,” she wrote in 
an email statement.

Texas 
A&M, 
the 
other 

school Spencer claimed to 
be visiting, also released a 
statement 
last 
Wednesday 

clarifying the appearance had 
not been cleared by university 
officials and distancing the 
school from any connection to 
Spencer.

“There 
has 
been 
deep 

concern expressed by our 
Aggie community about an 
individual planning to speak 
at our campus,” the statement 
reads. “Our leadership finds 
his views as expressed to date 
in direct conflict with our 
core values.”

Spencer 
made 
headlines 

the week after the election 
for 
hosting 
an 
alt-right 

gathering 
in 
Washington, 

D.C. celebrating President-
elect 
Donald 
Trump’s 

victory 
with 
neo-Nazi 

salutes of “Hail Trump” and 
“Hail victory,” the English 
translation of the Nazi slogan 
“Sieg Heil.” Spencer’s speech 
at the gathering promoted 
refrains about white people 
“awakening 
to 
their 
own 

identity.”

Students on all ends of 

the 
political 
spectrum 
at 

the 
University 
similarly 

expressed 
concerns 
about 

the possibility of Spencer 
appearing on campus. LSA 
junior Grant Strobl, founding 
chairman of the University of 
Michigan chapter of Young 
Americans for Freedom, a 
student 
organization 
that 

has 
invited 
provocative 

conservative 
speakers 

to campus, such as Milo 
Yiannopoulos, 
stressed 
in 

an email interview that YAF 
was “obviously not” affiliated 
with alt-right figures like 
Spencer.

“Conservative 
ideas 

undermine 
and 
are 
not 

compatible with the alt-right,” 
he wrote. “Conservatism has 
no place for racism.”

Rackham student Austin 

McCoy 
linked 
the 
racist 

posters repeatedly discovered 
on 
campus 
to 
white 

supremacists reaching out to 
disgruntled white students 
in the wake of University 
President 
Mark 
Schissel’s 

Diversity, 
Equity 
and 

Last 
week 
the 
Detroit 

Pistons, 
who 
have 
been 

playing 
at 
The 
Palace 
of 

Auburn Hills for the past 28 
years, announced that they’d 
be coming back to the city to 
play in the newly minted Little 
Caesars stadium next season.

The move was announced by 

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, 
Detroit Pistons owner Tom 
Gores 
and 
Christopher 

Ilitch, president and CEO of 
Ilitch Holdings, Inc. Little

Arena, 
which

already slated to house the 
Red Wings, is owned by

COLUMBUS — A couple of 

minutes after 4 p.m. Saturday, 
with a sea of gleeful Ohio State 
fans forming around him and 
chanting his name, Urban Meyer 
was doubled over. After defeating 
the Michigan football team for 
the fifth time in five years, the 
Buckeyes’ coach collapsed in 
relief, stood back up and paused 

for a moment amid the delirium.

He walked slowly from the 

northwest corner of the field at 
Ohio Stadium to just outside the 
southeast tunnel, with a police 
officer on either side of him, 
each holding his back in support. 
Meyer, who took the Ohio State 
job after taking the 2011 season 
off due to health concerns, waited 
to do a postgame interview with 
ABC. “Shelley,” he whispered 
to the police officers, asking for 
his wife. They echoed her name, 

trying to find her in the chaos.

Meyer 
looked 
exhausted. 

Everyone did. The second-ranked 
Wolverines pushed the Buckeyes 
to the brink in a four-hour war 
Saturday afternoon. And yet Ohio 
State escaped in double overtime, 
30-27, on a 15-yard touchdown 
run by Curtis Samuel on the final 
play.

“I thought our guys have 

worked incredibly hard,” said 
a dejected Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. 
“They 
have 
done 

everything that they could, and 
they’ve done it so very well. I’m 
really proud of our players, yes.”

Michigan, with its best team 

since 2006, lost for the 12th time 
in 13 editions of this rivalry. Few 
of those, if any, will hurt more 
than this one.

The Wolverines’ last and best 

chance to put away a monumental 
win came on the penultimate play 
of the game. Ohio State took the 
ball second in double overtime, 
after Michigan scored on a Kenny 

Allen field goal to take a 27-24 
lead. The Wolverines forced a 
4th-and-1, a down and distance 
that has rescued them before.

This time, Barrett faked a 

handoff and kept the ball, taking 
a hit from Michigan safety 
Delano Hill and running into 
a block at the 15-yard line. The 
officials reviewed the play, one of 
many on Saturday that will live in 
the memories of those who saw 
the game. But the call stood. On 
the next play, Samuel scampered 

in untouched for the win.

Michigan 
and 
Ohio 
State 

traded touchdowns on the first 
possession of overtime, with the 
Buckeyes needing just two plays 
to reach the end zone. But only 
late in the game did they begin 
to show that firepower, after the 
Wolverines controlled most of 
the game.

As it has for most of Harbaugh’s 

tenure, Michigan relied on its 
defense. Even against the electric

Before Michigan’s last 

football game of the regular 

season, the Ohio State branch 

of the satirical website Barstool 

posted a tweet showing a group 

of individuals in OSU garb with 

the sign, “Michigan Girls: More 

Diseased than Flint Water”.

The tweet referenced the 

ongoing water crisis in Flint, 

which has sparked significant 

health concerns for residents 

and garnered national attention 

for over a year. The crisis 

started after the city switched 

water sources to the Flint River 

without using anti-corrosive 

treatments, causing lead to 

leach out of the pipes and into 

the water. It has been linked 

to medical issues in Flint 

residents, especially children, 

which include severe bone pain, 

crumbling of the teeth, and 

cancer.

The website, a sports blog 

targeting a largely young college-

aged male audience, posted the 

photo Saturday

Both Michigan and Ohio 

State fans reacted negatively 

to the OSU Barstool tweet, 

which has been posted for over 

10 hours. Students from both 

the University and Ohio State 

requested for the tweet to either 

be deleted or the account to be 

terminated.

Others directly criticized 

the parent company, Barstool 

publications, for the remarks. 

The main site has come under 

fire due to jokes deemed 

offensive before, like in 2012, for 

jokes regarding sexual assault. 

According to the Huffington 

Post, many protested Barstool’s 

own concert tours in support of 

sexual assault victims.

State Sen. Jim Ananich 

(D-Flint) said in an interview 

with NPR earlier this month 

that Flint residents are still 

struggling to have clean water 

to drink.

“And I think, as a resident 

of Flint, and my neighbors, 

I can tell you we don’t feel 

the urgency that I think that 

this crisis deserves,” he said. 

“(Flint citizens) need to have 

the health, nutrition and 

educational services to help with 

the children that were hurt and 

seniors and other folks that have 

been damaged.

ON THE DAILY: OSU FANS MOCK FLINT WATER CRISIS AT GAME

SANTA IN KE RRY TOWN

J. 
Alex 
Halderman, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

professor 
of 
electrical 

engineering 
and 
computer 

science, is currently leading a 
group of computer scientists 
and election lawyers from 
around 
the 
country 
who 

are urging 2016 Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton to call for a recount 
in three swing states won by 
President-elect Donald Trump 
— Wisconsin, Michigan and 
Pennsylvania.

While Clinton hasn’t moved 

forward on filing for recounts, 
Green 
Party 
presidential 

nominee Jill Stein has filed for 
a recount and filed a petition in 
Wisconsin last Friday with the 
state’s Election Commission 

to have all votes recounted. 
Stein plans to file petitions in 
Michigan and Pennsylvania 
as well. Stein’s actions now 
leave many Clinton supporters 
hopeful as they approach the 
Dec. 13 deadline for Wisconsin 
to release the recount results.

Halderman, 
director 
of 

the University’s Center for 
Computer 
Security 
and 

Society, 
and 
voting-rights 

attorney 
John 
Bonifaz 

believe 
there 
is 
evidence 

that the results from the 
aforementioned states were 
manipulated 
or 
hacked. 

Halderman found the results 
questionable in counties that 
relied on electronic voting 
machines instead of paper 
ballots or optical scanners.

While the group has not 

spoken publicly about the 
matter, 
they 
are 
lobbying 

heavily 
with 
the 
Clinton 

campaign 
in 
private. 
On 

Nov. 17, the lobbyists had a 
conference call with Clinton’s 
campaign 
chairman 
John 

Podesta and Marc Elias, the 
campaign’s general council, 
urging the campaign to file 
for a recount based on their 
expertise and evidence found 
in those three key swing 
states.

In the initial count, Trump 

won the presidency with 290 
Electoral College votes to 
Clinton’s 232. Assuming he 
won Michigan’s 16 votes as 
well — the race has not yet been 
certified in the state because 
the margins are so narrow 
— Clinton would have to 
overturn results in Wisconsin, 
Michigan and Pennsylvania to 
flip the Electoral College.

In Wisconsin, Halderman 

and 
the 
other 
activists 

found 
through 
statistical 

analyses 
that 
Clinton 

received 7 percent fewer 
votes 
in 
counties 
that 

used 
electronic 
voting 

machines 
rather 
than 

optical scanners and paper 
ballots. Extrapolating this 
analysis shows that Clinton 
may have lost up to 30,000 
votes in total throughout 
Wisconsin, a state she lost 
by only 27,177 votes.

The group found no clear 

evidence 
of 
hacking 
or 

manipulation in Wisconsin, 
but 
did 
come 
to 
the 

consensus that this pattern 
qualifies for an independent 
review. The White House 
is also suspicious of the 
Russian government, which 
was recently accused of 
hacking 
the 
Democratic 

National Committee.

trifecta of Barrett, Samuel and 
running back Mike Weber, 
coordinator Don Brown’s unit 
dominated. The Wolverines 
gave up just 206 yards on 50 
carries. They sacked Barrett 
eight 
times, 
piled 
up 
13 

tackles for loss and added an 
interception.

But 
the 
offense 
could 

never deliver the clinching 
blow. Down 3-0 in the second 
quarter, having gained 26 total 
yards on its past four drives, 
Ohio State intercepted a pass 
from 
redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight 
and 
returned 
it 
four 
a 

touchdown. Early in the third 
quarter, the Wolverines had a 
chance to take a 17-7 lead when 
Speight fumbled the snap on 
the Buckeyes’ 1-yard line. And 
after Michigan did take a 17-7 

lead, it gained just 30 yards on 
its last four possessions when 
it could have put the game 
away.

The Wolverines led for more 

than 56 minutes of regulation, 
sent 
the 
game 
to 
double 

overtime 
and 
could 
have 

ended the game on multiple 
occasions. If they had, they 
would be heading to the Big 
Ten Championship Game next 
Saturday night with a chance 
to advance to the College 
Football Playoff from there. 
Now, Michigan’s playoff hopes 
are all but gone.

“We make our case on the 

field, if you’re going to make 
any 
arguments 
or 
cases,” 

Harbaugh said. “We feel like 
they’ve done everything they 
can possibly do, and they’ve 
done it very well.”

Harbaugh’s team shuffled 

off the field after the game, 
trying to elude the masses as 
the 
opponent’s fans 

rushed the field for the second 
time in three weeks. In the 
postgame 
mayhem, 
Meyer 

couldn’t meet up with his wife, 
though he did embrace his 
son in a long hug. Then, when 
he took the podium at his 
postgame press conference, 
his wife called him. “She said, 
bring a gallon of milk home on 
the way home,” he quipped.

He said he did not remember 

what happened after the game, 
only the Samuel touchdown, 
one few will ever forget: “We 
motioned the tight end across, 
two backs in the backfield. We 
expected them to be bear, bear 
defense, and pressure. And the 
left tackle, Jamarco (Jones), 
did a nice job sealing it. 
Tailback led, Mike Weber, and 
Curtis scored, and we won.”

Curtis scored, and Ohio 

State won. Michigan was as 
close as it has been in a while. 
But the Buckeyes’ dominance 
lives.

wrote. “I am by no means a 

basketball fan but it seems like 
a fun activity. With the new 
location, it will be much easier 
to make a day of it.”

She added that in the new 

location the Pistons will be 
closer to other attractions in 
Detroit where she can go with 
friends before a game, such 
as the Eastern Market or the 
Detroit Institute of Arts. 

“I always thought it was 

weird that the Detroit Pistons 

didn’t actually play in Detroit,” 
Westerlund wrote. “If you live 
somewhere downriver, even 
if you were a huge fan, it’s 
not worth the trek, especially 
on a weeknight. Having the 
stadium right downtown will 
give the team a greater draw 

of 
fans. 
An 
out-of-towner 

wouldn’t 
be 
as 
motivated 

to come to a game and tour 
Auburn Hills versus getting 
to see Detroit and their team 
play.”

The arena, which is being 

lauded for its potential to 
attract capital to the area, 
has received some backlash 
in the community. In October, 
contractors 
of 
the 
project 

faced fines of nearly half a 
million 
dollars, 
according 

to Crain’s Detroit, for not 
hiring enough local workers. 
According to a city ordinance, 
local labor must make up at 
least 51 percent of the total 
work.

To 
ensure 
the 
Pistons’ 

relocation would be profitable, 
Gores had a sports expert 
research 
the 
venture, 
the 

Free Press reported. Mark 
Rosentraub, 
professor 
of 

kinesiology at the University, 
determined the move would 
bring with it construction 
jobs, increased value of ticket 
sales for games and concerts 
and jobs both at the site and 
potential spin-off locations. 
The total impact is projected 
to be $596.2 million relocated 
to the Detroit area.

According to the company, 

the stadium will open Sept. 17 
2017.

“The 
goal 
of 
white 

nationalists has been to appeal 
to disaffected white students 
who may be unhappy with 
the 
University’s 
diversity 

initiatives,” he wrote in an 
email interview. “This is one 

of the reasons why the first 
set of racist posters appeared 
on Monday, September 26, the 
week before President Schlissel 
formally released the Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion (plan).”

also 

frequently undergoes severe 
Twitter backlash from alt-

accounts, 
highlighting 

a pattern of intense, often 
faceless, online harassment by 
alt-right social media bots. LSA 
freshman Kori Thomas, who 

tweeted of racist posters she 
discovered outside South Quad 
Residence Hall last month, 
faced dozens of tweets riddled 
with racial epithets and insults.

“White nationalists not only 

seek to create a safe space for 
themselves … but to provoke a 
backlash that may prove their 
claims that those opposed to 
racism and white supremacy 
oppose 
their 
free 
speech 

rights,” McCoy wrote.

across the University.

Though the survey has been 

given annually since 2012, Robert 
Marans, one of the co-principal 
investigators 
of 
SCIP 
and 
a 

research professor at the ISR, said 
SCIP data will not be collected this 
year.

“It’s partly (because of) budget, 

but also we’re not seeing the kind 
of changes we were hoping to see,” 
Marans said. “And the general 
feeling is that trying to change 
people’s behavior is a slow process. 
The annual survey shows small 
changes here and there, but for the 
most part, no changes.”

The survey will resume in 

the fall of 2017 and will then be 
administered every other year, 
with hopes that more significant 
changes will be observed in the 

data with a larger gap between 
surveys.

There are currently four long-

term 
sustainability 
goals 
for 

the 
University, 
created 
under 

University 
President 
emeritus 

Mary Sue Coleman in 2011. These 
goals, which are implemented by 
the same program that distributes 
the survey, outline University 
initiatives 
on 
climate 
action, 

waste 
prevention, 
a 
healthy 

environment 
and 
community 

awareness. SCIP was created as 
part of the community awareness 
goal and tracks the “culture of 
sustainability” on campus.

The data showed an increase 

in 
community 
awareness 
of 

areas of sustainability, such as 
travel, transportation and food. 
The full report also shows the 
campus community has become 
more knowledgeable about waste 
prevention, and has increased 
recycling and reusing of materials 
both on campus and at home.

Beyond the survey, SCIP is 

currently piloting several projects 
on campus to increase awareness 
of sustainability.

In Bursley Residence Hall, 

an 
experiment 
to 
increase 

composting opportunities beyond 
the dining hall is currently in 
place. Marans said the experiment 
began last January and will be 
extended to other residence halls 
if successful.

“If you want to order pizza, 

what do you do with the leftover 
pizza and the box and all that stuff 
in the room?” Marans said. “If 
Bursley residents know more about 
 

composting(after this experiment), 
do more composting, than students 
in other residence halls, then we 
can say, ‘Hey, that experiment was 
worthwhile; we should take it to 
other residence halls.’ ”

Students around campus are also 

getting involved in sustainability 
in various other ways on their 
own. LSA senior Jayson Toweh, 

a Program in the Environment 
major, is the president of Students 
for Clean Energy, the chair of 
Central 
Student 
Government 

Sustainability Commission and 
an 
administrative 
liaison 
for 

the Students for Sustainability 
Initiative. He said students are 
becoming increasingly involved 
in part because they see a lack of 
interest from the administration.

“One 
reason 
that 
we’re 

really active is because a lot of 
people involved in sustainability 
organizations do not believe that 
the University itself is making any 
large commitment towards being 
more sustainable,” Toweh said.

Other 
students 
said 
they 

wanted to University support on 
sustainability, such as in Greek 
Life. LSA sophomore Aliza Sitrin, 
a member of Delta Phi Epsilon 
sorority, 
wanted 
to 
introduce 

composting to her house but ran 
into barriers due to potential cost 
and smell. Eventually, she and the 

friend she was collaborating with 
decided to drop the project.

Currently, the sorority house 

has recycling bins but Sitrin says 
she doesn’t know of any other plans 
to increase sustainability efforts.

Marans 
acknowledged 

that the SCIP survey shows 
that communication from the 
University about sustainability is an 
area that could use improvement.

“There are signs up in the 

Fishbowl and all over, but no 
one reads them,” Marans said. 
“We need to do a better job 
communicating.”

Toweh 
said 
based 
on 
his 

experiences, he would like to see 
the University launch an online 
educational program similar to 
AlcoholEdu could help students 
learn more about practices like 
conserving energy and washing 
clothes in a sustainable way. 

“Currently you have a lot of 

people who are really informed 
and really invested, and a lot 

of people who would be more 
invested if they knew what the 
impact was,” Toweh said. “The 
whole concept is just staying alive. 
If people care about sustaining life 
as it is, caring about sustainability 
is a key thing.”

Though the survey has been 

given annually since 2012, Marans 
said SCIP data will not be collected 
this year.

“It’s partly (because of) budget, 

but also we’re not seeing the kind 
of changes we were hoping to see,” 
Marans said. “And the general 
feeling is that trying to change 
people’s behavior is a slow process. 
The annual survey shows small 
changes here and there, but for the 
most part, no changes.”

The survey will resume in 

the fall of 2017 and will then be 
administered every other year, 
with hopes that more significant 
changes will be observed in the 
data with a larger gap between 
surveys.

SUSTAINABILITY
From Page 1A

“I always 

thought it was 
weird that the 
Detroit Pistons 
didn’t actually 
play in Detroit.”

COLUMBUS — When the 

Michigan football team loses to 
Ohio State, especially in games 
decided by just a few points, 
there are often plays that haunt 
Wolverine fans for decades.

The 2006 game, possibly 

the biggest in the rivalry’s 
history, brought Shawn Crable’s 
momentum-changing, helmet-
to-helmet 
hit 
on 
Buckeye 

quarterback Troy Smith. The 
2013 game ended with an 
attempted 2-point conversion 
by Michigan, where Devin 
Gardner’s 
potential 
game-

winning pass was picked off 
and denied the Wolverines a 
monumental upset.

The 2016 version of “The 

Game” — the teams’ most 
important showdown in 10 
years — ended in heartbreak 
again for No. 3 Michigan, which 
fell to No. 2 Ohio State, 30-27, in 
double overtime.

Yet again, there will be 

plays Wolverine fans will have 
ingrained in their minds for a 
while. But this time, Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh directed 
the blame elsewhere.

“I am bitterly disappointed 

with the officiating today,” he 
said. “That spot … the graphic 
display 
is 
the 
interference 

penalties. The one not called 
on us on Grant Perry, (who) 
clearly was being hooked before 
the ball got there. The previous 
penalty they called on Delano 
Hill — the ball is uncatchable 
and by the receiver.”

There was a third-down pass 

from Ohio State quarterback J.T. 
Barrett that sailed incomplete 
well beyond his receiver’s reach, 
only for Michigan senior safety 
Delano Hill to get whistled for 
pass interference. There was 
another third-down pass, this 
time from the Wolverines in 
the second overtime, where 
sophomore 
receiver 
Grant 

Perry received no call from 
the officials despite appearing 
to have his arm hooked by a 
defender.

And, most crucially, there 

was a 4th-and-1 conversion by 
Barrett in double overtime, 
which the referees ruled a first 
down and upheld after review 
— if he had been ruled short, 
the game would have been over, 
and the Wolverines would have 
escaped with a 27-24 victory.

Those 
final 
controversial 

plays were the decisive ones, 
but they weren’t the first times 
the 
officiating 
crew 
drew 

Harbaugh’s ire. Late in the third 
quarter, he was incensed after a 
potential Ohio State false start 
was ruled an offside penalty by 
the Wolverines.

Harbaugh tossed his play 

card into the air and spiked 
his headset into the ground, 
drawing an unsportsmanlike 
conduct penalty that further 
baffled him.

“(The referees) could have 

been watching the game rather 
than being concerned about 
(me),” Harbaugh said. “If you 
throw a hat, you throw your 
script toward your sideline, 
that’s a penalty? I asked (the 
referee) that, and he said, ‘Well, 

it is in basketball.’

“I 
go, 
‘Well, 
this 
isn’t 

basketball.’ ”

Harbaugh 
reiterated 
his 

disappointment several times 
in a heated, eight-minute post-
game press conference, but he 
wasn’t the only one feeling it.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

chose his words carefully after 
the game, physically stopping 
himself from criticizing the 
officials’ calls in the overtime 
periods. 
Fifth-year 
senior 

defensive end Chris Wormley 
made his thoughts a little 
clearer — he was a part of 
Barrett’s decisive conversion, 
shoving 
the 
quarterback 

backward with his right arm as 
Hill hit him low.

“I think he was short,” 

Wormley said. “But I guess the 
refs saw something different. 
You’ve gotta play through those 
types of calls, those types of 
adversity.”

Michigan made plenty of 

other mistakes — a stagnant 
fourth quarter offense and a 
few costly turnovers let the 
Buckeyes back in the game in 
the first place, and running 
back Curtis Samuel ran 15 yards 
to the end zone untouched on 
the game’s final play.

But in the end — like some 

fans might for decades to 
come 
— 
Harbaugh 
found 

himself unable get past the 
controversial calls.

“We’re probably just going 

to keep beating a dead horse 
here,” he said to end his press 
conference. “You know how I 
feel.”

Daily Sports Editor


I

n the aftermath of the 2016 
presidential election, I, like 
many others, experienced 

an 
amalgam 
of 
emotions: 

frustration, anger, fear, guilt, 
shame. In particular, in a way 
more than ever before, I have 
felt the overwhelming presence 
of my privilege as a white man 
in the United States. As CNN 
reporter Van Jones put it, 
“This was a whitelash against a 
changing country.”

In my own processing of the 

result, one overarching theme 
was guilt and shame. I felt I should 
be apologizing without end to 
the people I love on this campus 
who witnessed, many without 
shock, hate — hate directed at 
them and their loved ones — win 
the most powerful seat in the 
world. I asked myself, “What 
can I do? Is there anything I can 
or should do?” In conversations 
about the election, I felt more 
than ever the weight behind my 
own voice. I felt my words, from 
the mouth of a white man, fill up 
the conversation space, newly 
empowered and looming ever 
more forcefully.

I quickly came to two key 

realizations. First, no one should 
ever be told how to feel. The flood 
of tone policing I witnessed in 
the aftermath of the election 
astonished me, as if there was 
nothing to grieve, as if there was 
nothing to fear. And the voice this 
came from most frequently was 
again from the mouths of white 
men. Astonishingly, this came 
frequently from liberal white 
men, calling on minorities to not 
give up hope and rally together 
to fight back while showing 
complete blindness to what a 

position of privilege it is to be able 
to feel better so quickly about 
what has just happened.

I would, with as much patience 

and kindness as I can express, 
implore my white male friends 
to please allow people to feel 
what they are going to feel and 
to validate those feelings. Allow 
the women in your life to feel 
what they feel in response to a 
self-described sexual predator 
living in the White House. Allow 
the LGBTQ people in your life to 
feel what they feel about Trump’s 
vice 
presidential 
candidate 

Mike Pence, who wrote on his 
campaign website, “Resources 
should be directed toward those 
institutions 
which 
provide 

assistance to those seeking to 
change their sexual behavior,” 
a euphemistic description of 
gay conversion therapy. Allow 
the people of color, Muslims 
and immigrants in your life to 
feel what they feel about a man 
who empowers and emboldens, 
through his words and actions, 
racism and xenophobia in a way 
not otherwise possible.

The second realization I had 

in the aftermath of this election: 
I am not doing enough. As I 
felt in the most tangible sense 
imaginable the weight of privilege 
surrounding me, I wondered why 
I had not used this strength for 
something positive. I have power 
as a white man. Undeserved 
power, but power nonetheless. 
I have felt complacent in simply 
ensuring that I mitigate the 
harmful effects it could have on 
those without it. A “do no harm” 
approach is no longer going to cut 
it for me. It is not enough for me 
to voice shock and outrage and 

wonder, “How could anyone vote 
for that man?” They did. And I 
feel it’s my responsibility to find 
out why. Why did they decide that 
their desires were great enough 
to justify that man’s rhetoric 
and the words and actions of his 
supporters? Why did they decide 
they had so much to fear that they 
would support this decision?

Finally, I know that I must 

also proceed with caution. Being 
an ally is a position that requires 
tremendous humility and care. 
I recognize that I am not a 
champion. I am not a hero. I do 
not deserve and in fact reject any 
credit whatsoever for any change 
I may contribute to bringing 
about. I am reminded of the 
words and attitude of Frederick 
Douglass when he was invited to 
speak on the women’s suffrage 
movement two decades before the 
passage of the 19th Amendment. 
I know that an ally’s role is to 
first and foremost “to take back 
benches and wrap themselves in 
silence.” It is not my role to preach 
to the choir when there are so 
many other members of that group 
more eloquent, intelligent and 
moving than myself who could 
speak instead.

However, I can contribute to 

the difficult work of showing 
those who refuse to listen the 
beauty of those voices. I can 
validate 
and 
recognize 
fear 

and pain and seek solutions to 
overcoming them in due time. 
And I can continue to recognize 
the weight of my own white words 
and continue to desperately seek 
ways to use their power to shape 
a better future. 

A

n open letter to the faculty 
of 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan:

Over 40 percent of students 

at the University of Michigan 
reported having felt so depressed 
that it was difficult to function 
at least once during the school 
year. Additionally, approximately 
11 percent said they seriously 
considered 
attempting 
suicide 

at least once in the last school 
year. There are now more mental 
health and well-being student 
organizations on campus than ever. 
Clearly, mental health awareness 
and resource availability are topics 
that resonate with many students 
at the University. It is for this 
reason that we, CAPS In Action, a 
new student organization within 
the University’s Counseling and 
Psychological Services that “puts 
the CAPS initiatives in action,” 
would like to inform you of some of 
the biggest mental health concerns 
that students face on this campus 
and what role you can play to 
combat these statistics.

The faculty at the University play 

one of the biggest roles in students’ 
lives. Mental health is shaped by 
a community, so it is important 
that students are able to turn to 
their professors and Graduate 
Student Intructors for support and 
understanding. The key to helping 
fellow students is accessibility 
and communication. Professors’ 
voices are important, and we will 
respect what you have to say. We 
know that you want your students 
to succeed, and we want to suggest 
ways to support our academics 
and health. School can be hard, 
and mental health often takes the 
back seat to final grades. In a highly 

competitive environment and with 
the pressures of multiple exams 
and papers bearing down over 
short periods of time, it becomes 
a challenge to balance studies 
with mental wellness. Without 
enough time to relax, some 
students develop a toxic mental 
health lifestyle.

Therefore, we seek campus 

resources. However, fear takes over 
as our issues remain unaddressed. 
The most common of these 
fears is that of authority. We are 
reluctant to open a dialogue with 
our professors about our mental 
health issues because campus 
is a professional environment 
and showing weakness is not a 
professional trait. When we work 
up the courage to seek advice 
and help from instructors, we are 
sometimes met with disbelief and 
requests for medical proof. Our 
mental illnesses and health are 
real, and CIA’s hope is to encourage 
faculty to not only become more 
aware of the prevalence of mental 
health issues on campus, but also 
to take part in addressing them. 
When professors offer support 
and 
understanding, 
students 

notice. CIA member Aaron Brown 
recounts such an instance: “My 
professor continually highlighted 
the importance of mental health 
issues, (and put) mental health 
ahead of grades and assignments. 
Her office hours were always open 
to students to discuss any problems 
they faced, especially in light of the 
campus climate after the election. 
It was comforting to know I had 
someone to talk to.” 

As an easy first step, we would 

like to encourage you to incorporate 
new mental health language in 

your syllabi, like that which has 
been proposed by Central Student 
Government. Incorporating this 
statement in your syllabi will 
demonstrate your support for 
students’ well-being.

Secondly, we would appreciate 

promoting an inviting environment 
in your courses. Actions such as 
friendly emails before and after 
stressful exam periods, asking 
how we are doing and letting us 
know that we can come to you with 
mental health concerns would 
go a long way. We ask that you 
emphasize the value of self-care, 
especially during times like the 
upcoming finals week. With that in 
mind, remind us that we are valued 
and perhaps recommend ways for 
staying relaxed. We would also 
appreciate you to continue your 
guidance a few weeks prior to final 
exam week on how best to prepare. 
These reminders are very helpful 
in keeping us studying long-term 
and not cramming last-minute all-
nighters in.

Finally, we ask that you treat 

mental illness the same way you 
treat other illnesses. Though we as 
students are doing our best to fight 
the shame associated with mental 
health topics, the stigma can still, 
at times, be debilitating. Your 
leadership and central role in our 
lives can play a critical part in our 
fight to break down mental health 
barriers, and we look forward to 
the achievements we can make 
together at the University of 
Michigan.

Sincerely,
The Students of CAPS In Action.

I 

went to Counseling and 
Psychological Services two 
times this past month to sign 

up for counseling again. I saw a 
counselor last year, and talking 
to someone about my feelings 
helped tremendously 
with 
my 
anxiety. 

In 
that 
semester, 

I was able to love 
myself 
even 
more 

and understand how 
to better take care 
of myself mentally. 
This 
semester, 
I 

thought I could get 
by without seeing 
someone but came to 
the conclusion that I 
needed to return.

Each time I went into CAPS, I 

realized that there were at least 
five people signing up to receive 
their first session of counseling, 
which was mind-boggling to me 
because I was there for just 10 
minutes each day. How many 
more new people walk in each 
day coming for help, too?

After 
receiving 
my 
initial 

consultation 
appointment, 
I 

was told there wouldn’t be any 
open appointments until at least 
January. 
I 
wasn’t 
frustrated 

with the staff because they 
couldn’t do anything about it, 
but I immediately realized the 
problem here: It’s not that CAPS 
has too few staff members, it’s 
that the rigor of the University 
of Michigan itself is not healthy 
for students. Yes, college is not 
a walk in the park and gives 
virtually every student extreme 
difficulty, but the culture of work 
and competition is particularly 
burdensome at this school. CAPS 
conducted a study that shows 
one-fourth of the University 
population reported they’ve had 
thoughts of suicidal ideation. 
That number could be higher 
today, which is something that 
we cannot simply accept and not 
make changes.

CAPS does have a 24/7 hotline 

that students can reach out to 
for emergencies, but admittedly, 
the hotline can only do so much. 
Mental health can be a battle 
every day, especially with the 
consistent demands the culture of 
the University puts on its students. 
Students must act autonomously 
toward 
their 
mental 
health, 

though I recognize this is easier 

said than done. This would mean 
going to see a doctor to provide 
medication if you need it, seeing a 
therapist (they can be expensive, 
but insurance can help if you 
have it) or talking to a friend or 

family member. I had 
a hard time making 
this choice. I pushed 
it 
off 
further 
and 

further, but eventually 
my girlfriend helped 
me 
to 
contact 
an 

in-town 
counselor 

to talk about how to 
deal with my anxiety 
again. Students can 
tell a friend that they 
need help contacting 
someone 
or 
have 

conversations with someone they 
can trust. I recommend seeing 
a professional, but any sort of 
counseling that isn’t putting any 
pressure on an individual is better 
than not being able to talk through 
your feelings at all.

With CAPS not having enough 

time or people to take care of 
everyone in the way they need, 
those who need help cannot 
continue to wait. The pressures 
of meeting school deadlines, 
maintaining relationships and 
competing with the rest of your 
class are issues that do not go to 
rest. Those who have reached out 
for help have already taken a big 
step in attempting to get help and 
cannot get discouraged if they 
have to wait.

Mental health continues to 

carry a stigma — it’s important 
to recognize that seeking aid 
does not mean the individual is 
weak, but rather that they are 
strong. So many people keep this 
as a secret, but the odds are many 
have multiple friends who share 
this experience. I have felt alone 
at times in my anxiety, but have 
found care and felt understood 
in finding and talking to friends 
who have gone through the same 
anxieties as me.

I’ve 
had 
anxiety 
at 
this 

University 
over 
multiple 

things, including not feeling 
as competent in my studies 
compared to my peers. I’ve lost 
sleep planning my responsibilities 
and feeling stupid after I bombed 
an exam. These feelings are 
normal, 
and 
competition 
is 

bound to happen at one of the 
top institutions in the world. But 

the University can do to better 
address this culture and help 
those who are struggling to find 
support for their mental health.

It is not the University’s job to 

babysit its students, but it should 
emphasize caring for them as a 
top priority because it is an overall 
life priority. I have a professor 
who allows excused absences 
for mental health days. It meant 
the world to me. I felt cared for 
and understood. This is the type 
of culture that I hope the rest of 
the University, both students and 
staff, will embody. Mental health 
struggles are real and should not 
be swept under the rug.

There is a large need for 

mental 
health 
services 
at 

Michigan. 
We 
are 
students 

fighting hard to stay afloat in 
our 
classes, 
extracurriculars 

and postgraduate opportunities. 
There are so many of us with 
anxiety and depression, among 
other things, which can be 
triggered by the culture here, 
traumatic experiences or by a 
preexisting condition. Don’t wait 
for help. Keep fighting for it. Your 
mental health is yours to own, 
and you cannot shy away from it. 
You may not need a therapist, but 
at least talk to someone you trust 
to talk about how you feel, because 
you are not alone in your fight.

It’s 
on 
the 
University 

community 
to

My own white words

A solution for the refugee crisis

DAVID DONNANTUONO | OP-ED

L

aw Prof. James Hathaway, 
founder and director of 
the University of Michigan 

Law School’s Program in Refugee 
and Asylum Law, spoke earnestly 
to a group of Michigan students 
at a lecture on Nov. 9 about a 
situation whose urgency should be 
ubiquitous even in the wake of this 
month’s contentious election. The 
state of the global refugee system 
is in many ways egregious, marked 
with an unequal assumption of 
responsibilities by states, horrible 
conditions for asylum-seekers and 
specious incentives for a number 
of actors. The refugee crisis of 
the past five years has made this 
already dire problem far more 
salient in the Western world, and 
Hathaway insists sticking with the 
status quo is not an option.

The most prominent flaw in 

the current refugee system is 
the astoundingly asymmetrical 
distribution 
of 
displaced 

populations. 
According 
to 

Hathaway, given the lack of 
international 
cooperation 
and 

growing 
reluctance 
by 
many 

developed states to take in refugees, 
approximately 85 percent of global 
refugees reside in poorer countries, 
many of them contiguous to the 
conflicts from which refugees are 
fleeing. 
Consequently, 
Turkey, 

Jordan, Iran, Pakistan and others 
have been forced to shoulder a 
tremendous burden with Western 
support being more superficial 
than palpable at times. Hathaway 
pointed 
to 
one 
eye-opening 

statistic that is illustrative of this 
reality: Western nations spend 
more in processing the claims of 
the 15 percent of world refugees 
entering Western countries than in 
assisting the 85 percent of refugees 
living elsewhere.

Perhaps the greatest barrier to 

the West’s collective engagement 
with the world’s refugee problem 
is our effort to circumvent the 
issue itself. Between the European 
Union’s deal with Turkey to deflect 
refugees back to the Middle 
East and growing anti-refugee 
rhetoric from elected officials, 

many developed nations have not 
yet acknowledged that the global 
refugee crisis is a problem that we 
all have a responsibility to help 
solve. As it stands, the majority 
of the world’s refugees live in 
harsh conditions, uncertain of 
what the future holds, faced with 
ever-growing contempt from the 
countries with the greatest means 
to support them.

Hathaway 
did 
recognize 
a 

silver lining amid the disarray: A 
solution already exists; we simply 
need to operationalize it. The UN 
Refugee Convention of 1951 — 
signed by the United States and 
146 other countries — insisted 
upon a collective system in which 
all participating countries take 
on a level of responsibility for the 
inevitable and dynamic surges of 
refugees. It declared that refugees 
are entitled to arrive to a country 
without permission, granted rights 
to empowerment such as work and 
mobility and called for measures 
to facilitate refugees’ eventual 
return home. Instead, the system 
that exists today is characterized 
by “10 countries doing 60 percent 
of the world’s refugee work simply 
due to geographic coincidence,” 
Hathaway said.

Instead, Western nations seem 

more concerned with the crime 
of smuggling and the dilemmas of 
cultural and economic integration 
than with the well-being of the 
world’s most vulnerable population. 
The now-commonplace political 
mantra 
of 
the 
“dangerous 

refugee” justifying a ban on 
their entry is suspect, as there 
is no indication that refugees 
are any more dangerous than 
American 
citizens 
or 
other 

migrants. Even then, our vetting 
process could hardly be more 
thorough. The West’s concerns 
are certainly legitimate but 
should not entirely supersede 
the responsibility we have 
assumed through our signing 
of the Refugee Convention, 
our continuous intervention 
abroad and our tremendous 
economic prosperity.

Hathaway 
proposes 
an 

“insurance-like” 
model 
to 

implement the framework laid out 
by this convention. Each country 
would take on certain financial 
and 
human 
responsibilities 

based on various characteristics 
(GDP, amount of arable land, 
demographics, 
etc.). 
These 

quotas would be agreed upon and 
distributed fairly in order to assuage 
the ongoing movement of refugees. 
In this model, refugees’ countries 
of arrival would not necessarily 
be their final destination, but 
rather their point of access to the 
international system. If states don’t 
believe that each and every new 
arrival becomes 100 percent their 
responsibility, they will be less 
inclined to unnecessarily lengthen 
their vetting process and hamper 
their transportation, which would 
simultaneously diminish the power 
of the refugee smuggling industry. 
Hathaway estimates that such an 
approach could lead to a third of 
refugees returning home within 
six years, another third remaining 
in contiguous countries and the 
final third finding a permanent 
home elsewhere.

Today, the Western world is 

yet to truly undertake a collective, 
systemic solution to the plight of the 
global refugee population. Instead, 
our discourse has centered around 
whether the refugee crisis should 
be our concern, rather than how we 
can ultimately resolve it. As a result, 
we have more or less perpetuated 
the state of limbo in which many 
refugees find themselves, while 
leaving a massive burden on less 
prosperous nations simply because 
of their geographical coincidence. 
A model like Professor Hathaway’s, 
which distributes this tremendous 
burden both sensibly and equitably, 
would lead to a more cooperative 
international 
community 
that 

lives 
up 
to 
its 
decades-old 

promises of bringing justice to 
the world’s most vulnerable and 
underrepresented population.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

A couple of weekends ago you 

might have noticed a host of well-
dressed people streaming down 
the sidewalks in the vicinity of 
the intersection between North 
University Avenue and South 
Thayer Street. Or perhaps, if 
you drive, you might have found 
yourself bumper-to-bumper in 
the sort of traffic jam normally 
reserved for game day. Either was 
rather likely, and the occasion 
was something which hadn’t 
happened since 2009 — the Berlin 
Philharmonic was in town.

My guess would be that it took 

around $81,000 to bring them 
across the ocean, given the price of 
airfare and the number of people. 
Tack on the expense of organizing 
everything, the negotiation with 
venues, the booking of hotels, the 
food, the chartering of busses 
and it doubtlessly amounts to a 
small fortune. In the end it must 
have been profitable, I suppose, 
but whoever managed it must 
have been a logistical mastermind 
with Herculean endurance, and 
I wouldn’t want their job for the 
world. Which is to say I’m really 
glad that someone did it, because 
the result of all that effort was a 
fantastic experience for thousands 
of people.

As a bit of background, the Berlin 

Philharmonic is widely considered 
to be one of the top four or five 
orchestras in the world, competing 
with the likes of the London and 
Vienna Symphonies. So to say that I 
was excited when it was announced 
they would be coming to Ann Arbor 
is an understatement. I bought 
my ticket well in advance, and 
looked forward to it all semester 
and all of the summer before that. 
I even spent a few days in Berlin in 
August, and while there declined 
to seek out any performances that 
might be happening, in anticipation 
of the Ann Arbor concert.

It 
certainly 
wasn’t 
a 

disappointment. 
Berlin’s 

reputation is well deserved, and 
the direction of Simon Rattle was 
stellar. I might even go so far as 
to say it was the best orchestral 
performance I had ever witnessed, 
and I’ve seen a fair few. Throughout 

the concert, the ensemble of over 
a hundred musicians played as if 
one. Every gesture was shaped 
together, each stream of sound 
perfectly balanced against the 
others. And the sounds they made 
were marvelous. The sweeping 
motions of the strings felt as if 
they were lifting you off the floor, 
and when the brass section played 
with all their might you felt it 
reverberating in your bones.

Aside from awe at the orchestra’s 

technique, 
the 
performance 

also left me with a few thoughts. 
The program I watched was in 
two parts: the second half was 
Brahms Symphony No. 2, a fairly 
conventional 
orchestral 
choice 

(and a personal milestone — 
I’ve now seen all the Brahms 
symphonies live), and the first half 
was a non-stop performance of 
music by Schoenberg, Webern and 
Berg, collectively known as the 
Second Viennese School. This was 
not a conventional choice. In fact, 
I’m fairly certain that until Berlin 
I had never attended an orchestral 
concert with music by any of those 
three, let alone all of them on one 
program. And in a word, I was 
thrilled — though not everyone 
agrees with my ecstasy.

I think I might be in the 

minority in this, but I love atonal 
music. While most people feel that 
it’s ugly, weird and just all around 
unpleasant to hear, I find it to be 
beautiful, colorful, expressive and 
liberating. And when you think of 
atonalism, it’s the three composers 
of the Second Viennese School 
who immediately come to mind. 
Partially 
because 
Schoenberg 

“invented” atonality, he and his 
pupils Webern and Bern are 
inextricably bound-up with it, but 
since that trio there have been 
countless composers who followed 
their footsteps, the atonal aesthetic 
coming to be the primary feature 
of 20th century Modernist music. 
Many of them have influenced 
the way that I work and think as a 
composer, so to hear the original 
atonal masters was a valuable 
experience.

After the concert I overheard 

many of the conversations going 
on around me. Many of them went 
something like this: “I wasn’t 
really sure about the first half, 
but the Brahms made it all worth 

it.” I found a similar sentiment 
expressed 
throughout 
the 

comment section of the University 
Musical Society website. And I 
understand why people might 
feel that way. I don’t agree with 
them, but there was a time when 
I might have, and it’s not my place 
to say someone’s musical taste 
is wrong. Coming to love atonal 
music was a long process, hours 
upon hours spent listening as I 
slowly started to understand the 
syntax and unlearned many of 
the assumptions I had about what 
music was. That’s not necessarily 
for everyone, but that is what 
everyone heard at the Berlin 
concert, which is why I find 
Maestro Rattle’s choice to include 
this music endlessly fascinating.

What should be included in an 

orchestra’s 
repertoire? 
Whose 

opinions should carry the most 
weight when deciding? On the 
one hand, part of an orchestra’s 
role is to “entertain,” so to speak. 
When someone goes home after 
an evening at the symphony it’s 
generally 
assumed 
that 
they 

should have had a good time. 
It follows that the tastes of the 
audience 
should 
bear 
upon 

the 
programming 
decisions. 

But orchestras also serve as 
champions of the arts. They 
should, ideally, expose people to 
types of music they have never 
really experienced, and promote 
works both by living composers 
and from periods that are less 
popular. In addition to providing 
enjoyment, they should challenge 
their listeners. The latter role 
might even be more important. 
The classics and sure-fire hits 
don’t need championing — they’re 
already ensconced in our culture.

At the end of everything, an 

approach like the one Rattle 
took is probably the best. Mixing 
the 
tried-and-true 
with 
the 

unconventional 
on 
the 
same 

program ensures balance. Ears 
searching for old favorites and 
exciting new worlds are both 
appeased. And by putting the 
Second Viennese School on a 
major program, it goes a long way 
towards normalizing them, and 
making them seem less new. Not 
that there’s any rush — the last of 
the three only died 65 years ago, 
after all.

My love for the Berlin Philharmonic

Their performance in Ann Arbor solidified their top-notch status

“The Eric Andre Show” is TV’s 

hardest sell. Sure, it airs on Fridays 
at midnight on the adult-oriented 
version of Cartoon Network — and 
that sentence alone has surely 
already lost me a few readers — 
but I’m so ardent in my “Ranch!” 
fervor that it’s a wonder my 
proselytizing hasn’t gotten me 
blocked from multiple contacts. 
Yet, despite innumerable pleas 
to friends, family and coworkers, 
my conversion rate is dispiritingly 
low.

I can’t say I’m surprised. 

Eric 
André’s 
(“Man 
Seeking 

Woman”) 
underappreciated 

series, which recently completed 
its fourth season, is a collection 
of compact, 12-minute bursts of 
pure, unbridled energy. It is (at the 
risk of using up all my adjectives 
too 
early) 
at 
once 
explicit, 

uncomfortable, hilarious, graphic, 
deadpan, 
raunchy, 
disgusting, 

absurdist, 
ironic, 
awkward, 

progressive, horrifying, manic and 
the televised embodiment of WTF.

It is, in one word, a miracle.
Ostensibly a parody of public 

access talk shows, “The Eric 
Andre Show” is the brainchild of 
the irrepressibly insane comedian 
whose name — and sensibility — 
it bears. Each episode features 
André as the odd, insecure host 
of a late-night show alongside 
comedian 
Hannibal 
Buress 

(“Broad City”), who literally does 
nothing more than stand on the 
side of the set and chime in with 
random asides. The title sequence 
features a live band, and then 
André subsequently tackling the 
drummer of said live band, as 
well as destroying his purposely 
cheap-looking set, on every single 
episode. And guests — many 
of whom simply have no idea 
what they’ve signed up for — are 
subjected to “interviews” that are 
abruptly spliced between on-the-
street segments.

That’s about as much formal 

structure as the show cares to 
have; 
beyond 
this, 
anything 

goes. Prerecorded segments are 
YouTube-ready, 
hidden-camera 

sketches 
that 
transgress 
the 

boundaries of comfort and good 
taste and, in some cases, the law. 
A few personal favorites: the 
aforementioned recurring series, 

“Ranch It Up,” in which our host 
spouts non sequiturs borne of 
an untethered writers’ room to 
passersby on the street before 
chugging a bottle of Hidden 
Valley Ranch; one in which André, 
covered in cereal and adorned 
with a dog collar, moans to subway 
passengers that he “did not, 
unfortunately, get the job at the 
Froot Loops factory” and proceeds 
to pour milk all over his crying face; 
another subway sketch in which 
André, dressed as a mailman 
and rocking Heelys, begins to rip 
apart letters and fake mail to the 
horror of people nearby, all the 
while screaming “I HATE MAIL! 
I HATE MAIL!” and ending 
with a lovely performance of the 
pan flute; and the crown jewel, a 
recurring sketch called “Bird Up!” 
that, in one episode, inexplicably 
ends with André, in a neon-green 
super suit and a toy bird glued to 
his shoulder, fingering the mouth 
of a woman on the street while 
repeatedly chanting the phrase, 
“YAH BOOBAY.” Yes, I know what 
you’re thinking — 126 years of 
editorial freedom, all culminating 
in that sentence.

Celebrity 
interviews 
are 

similarly odd. André’s stated 
mission is to make his guests 
as uncomfortable as possible. 
And by extension that means his 
viewers, too. Just as the camera 
often jarringly cuts to Buress 
doing 
something 
incredibly 

stupid, like screaming into a bite 
of a Hot Pocket, we are often 
treated to the most intimate, 
awkward and discomfiting of 
host-guest interactions. André 
alternately cranks the heat up 
on his set to sweltering levels, 
places cockroaches underneath 
his guests’ seat cushion, literally 
flashes Seth Rogen or, in one 
notorious sequence, prompts a 
genuinely heated walkout from 
Lauren Conrad after eating fake 
vomit from his desk.

The series’ comedic sensibility 

borders on nihilism, and it is 
the medium’s most fully formed 
simulacrum of utter anarchy. And 
in between moments of complete 
disgust, you realize that there’s 
much more brains behind the art.

It’s entirely plausible to detect, 

in André’s show, a scathing 
critique of the concept of modern 
American celebrity, or a cleverly 
disguised satire of racial politics 
in late-night television. And that 

subtext belies André’s prodigious 
perceptiveness and intelligence 
— 
something 
not 
normally 

associated with a show so devoted 
to lowbrow dick jokes and 420 
references.

If the static sameness of 

late-night 
television 
is 
the 

unquestioned norm, then “The 
Eric Andre Show” is here to 
detonate the status quo with 
a brashness that veers toward 
hyper-masculine arrogance, but 
is nonetheless revolutionary. Since 
their inception, talk shows have 
been constructed to mitigate the 
masses, to cast the widest net 
and reel in the largest audience 
by substituting inoffensiveness 
where dissidence might be more 
potent. This show isn’t interested 
in that.

A Berklee College of Music 

graduate, 
André 
toys 
with 

conventions like the “in-house 
band” in ways that are ostensibly 
base but slyly subversive. The host, 
who traded in the stand up bass 
for stand up comedy less than a 
decade ago, is more concerned 
with in-your-face humor than 
the air of smugness that often 
permeates shows like “The Daily 
Show” and “Last Week Tonight.” 
His influences are less Johnny 
Carson and more “Space Ghost 
Coast to Coast”; the show operates 
like an absurdist’s pastiche of 
“Jackass,” “Da Ali G Show” and 
Tyler, The Creator’s short-lived 
“Loiter Squad.”

And while there’s much to 

deconstruct, there exists the 
timeless 
pleasure 
of 
simply 

appreciating a show willing to 
traffic in comedy that is at once 
gleefully tasteless and legitimately 
boundary-pushing.

I find it difficult, however, 

to write about this marvel of a 
series and capture the distinct 
and exhilarating experience of 
actually watching it. To put it 
bluntly, this is the only show not 
named “Veep” currently on air that 
can elicit sincere tears of laughter 
in the solitary confinement of my 
bedroom.

So while the arbiters of good 

taste might deem “The Eric Andre 
Show” too niche for a mainstream 
audience, I bristle. That’s a fair 
characterization, sure, but it also 
misses the point. “The Eric Andre 
Show” is brilliant, uncomfortable 
and proudly, defiantly not for 
everyone. I plan to keep watching. 

‘Andre’ is glorified WTF

Off-beat Adult Swim staple is supremely underrated TV

A slow movie may not have 

the action or pacing to keep an 
audience’s attention, but there is 
always something to 
keep them invested, 
be 
it 
character 

or 
performance. 

Director 
Robert 

Zemeckis 
(“Back 

to the Future”) has 
done well with this 
type of movie in the 
past; “Cast Away” 
and “Flight,” both 
slow moving character pieces, 
rank among his best work. His 
newest film, “Allied,” is a different 
story. During the first half, it offers 
the viewer next to nothing to 
invest in, and by the time it gets the 
story rolling in hour two, it’s nearly 
too late.

Not all of these failings can 

be blamed on Zemeckis, because 
the script from Steven Knight 
(“Peaky Blinders”) is at least 
partially accountable as well. 
For the first half of the movie, 
scene after scene passes without 
making any significant progress 
in the development of character 
or plot. It seems to be biding time 
until something exciting finally 
happens at the end of the first 
act. At this point, the characters 
would ordinarily be holding the 
film together, but neither of them 
are all that engaging. They’re both 

shown to be competent spies, but 
that alone isn’t enough to capture 
one’s attention and hold it for any 
amount of time.

Some of the blame also has to 

go to the performers, in particular 
Brad Pitt (“Fight Club”), who plays 

Max Vatan. It’s 
something of an 
understatement 
to call Pitt a “good 
actor,” and he has 
improved 
with 

age — as his turns 
in 
“Inglorious 

Basterds,” 
“Moneyball” and 
“The Tree of Life” 

can attest. It’s hard to say what his 
problem is in “Allied,” but he comes 
across as flat for the bulk of the 
runtime. Even at Max Vatan’s most 
emotional, most intense moments, 
he seems almost incapable of 
emoting beyond slightly raising 
his voice or pouting. It’s telling 
that his best moment on screen is 
a scene in which he shuffles a deck 
of cards in magnificently over-the-
top fashion.

That blame doesn’t necessarily 

extend to the entire cast though. 
Marion Cotillard (“Inception”) 
gives a layered performance as 
Marianne Beauséjour once the 
script gives her something to work 
with, and is unarguably the best, 
most interesting part of the movie. 
The script calls for her to be 
potentially duplicitous, yet likable 
enough that the viewer roots for 
her to be truthful, and she walks 

the line with ease. Jared Harris 
(“Mad Men”) doesn’t get as much 
screen time in his supporting role 
as Max’s commanding officer, but 
even he adds more humanity and 
emotion to the affair than Pitt.

To the movie’s credit, “Allied” 

does 
get 
progressively 
more 

interesting as the story comes 
together. As Max begins to look 
into 
the 
accusations 
levelled 

against his wife, the viewer is 
forced, to a certain extent, to put 
themselves in his shoes. It’s hard 
at that point not to feel a little 
sympathy for him, even if he is 
the least fascinating part of the 
ordeal. Zemeckis even manages 
to draw out the suspense in a 
couple scenes; a sequence taking 
place under the cover of dark in 
a French jailhouse is particularly 
memorable for its intensity.

It’s ultimately sad that that 

same intensity — or at least level 
of engagement — did not spread 
to the rest of “Allied.” It clearly 
holds the markers of greatness. 
Zemeckis has directed some of the 
most iconic films ever made, Pitt 
and Cotillard are both spellbinding 
when they’re operating at the top 
of their game and Knight proved 
with “Locke” that the man can 
write a minimalist script with 
the best of them. Here, much 
of that talent feels squandered. 
“Allied” isn’t a complete loss, as 
it does slowly become an above-
average romantic thriller near 
its climax, but it is certainly a 
disappointment.

FILM REVIEW

TV NOTEBOOK


FILM REVIEW

“I don’t appear in public very 

often, but I think I should go out 
more.”

So 
says 
Howard 
Hughes, 

the legendary and mysterious 
industrialist, 
to 

an 
impressionable 

young child at the 
conclusion of “Rules 
Don’t Apply.” The 
same can be said 
for Warren Beatty, 
the 
notoriously 

reclusive 
and 

quiet 
actor 
(and 

director, writer and 
producer) who portrays Hughes 
in the film. This is Beatty’s first 
directorial effort since 1998’s 
“Bulworth,” and his first acting 
role 
since 
2001’s 
“Town 
& 

Country.” In other words, it has 
been a long time coming for fans of 
the mid-to-late-century icon. The 
film, too, has been gestating for a 
long time — Beatty allegedly began 
developing it after an encounter 
with Hughes in the early 1970s. 
But 
development 
hell 
can, 

appropriately, be damning, and 
the film’s disjointed screenplay 
sometimes infringes on its time-
tested material (see “The Aviator” 
for Hughes, “Hail, Caesar!” for 
1950s Hollywood).

It’s 1958. Dwight Eisenhower is 

the country’s president, Marilyn 
Monroe its biggest star. Church 
membership soars as businesses 
rapidly expand. The U.S. is fighting 
the Soviet Union, with nuclear 
fears abounding. In Hollywood 
the studio system reins, firmly 
controlling its stars, both fresh-
faced and weathered.

Marla Mabrey (Lily Collins, 

“Mirror Mirror”), an aspiring 
young 
actress, 
arrives 
in 

Hollywood from a strict Baptist 
upbringing in Virginia. Mabrey 

is under contract at RKO, which 
itself is run by Hughes (though 
the film gets the timeline wrong: 
Hughes in fact sold the studio in 
1955). She and her mother, lovingly 
played by Annette Bening (“The 
Kids Are All Right”), are driven 
by Frank Forbes (the absolutely 
wonderful 
Alden 
Ehrenreich, 

“Hail, 
Caesar!”), 

another 
new 

Hughes hire and 
a relatively devout 
Methodist.

Though 

forbidden 
by 

Hughes’s 
bans 

on 
hanky-panky 

between 
drivers 

and stars, as well 

as their respective religiosity 
(Forbes is, in fact, engaged), the 
two quickly develop a passionate 
relationship, bonding over shared 
professional shame over their 
distance from their boss, the 
illustrious Hughes. But as the two 
continue to establish themselves 
in the business, and grow closer 
to Hughes in unexpected ways, 
their 
lives 
grow 
increasingly 

complicated. 
They 
begin 
to 

question social mores and their 
place at RKO.

Much like the two’s time in 

Hollywood, “Rules Don’t Apply” 
itself can be sliced into two halves. 
The first is one of enchantment; 
tightly edited and beautifully 
shot, Hollywood is a land of 
expansive opportunity and one 
of its titans, Hughes, is reserved 
to mysteriously dark spaces. The 
second is one of disillusionment, 
or perhaps the erraticism that 
plagues Hughes. The bonds among 
Hughes, 
Forbes 
and 
Mabrey 

are strained and tested, and an 
intoxicating high of an all-too-
rare encounter with a legend in 
front of the camera fizzles into a 
throbbing hangover. Scenes drag 
on for far longer than necessary, 
or they only add more material to 

the convoluted plot. The laughs 
(which are relatively consistent 
towards the beginning) come far 
too infrequently. And throughout 
the film, overwrought drama, both 
in dialogue and cliché imagery, 
can suffocate the screenplay’s 
lightness.

But “Rules Don’t Apply” has 

an undeniable charm. There’s 
a 
scintillating 
dynamism 

and 
confidence 
about 
1950s 

Hollywood, and its extravagant 
offices, studios, houses and cars 
are beautifully brought to life in 
the film. Establishing shots seem 
to have been filmed with an old 
camera, rendering Los Angeles, 
Washington, D.C. and Acapulco 
like 
the 
faraway 
postcard 

destinations they had been at the 
time. The size and quality of the 
cast is astounding. Legendary 
actors appear in relatively small 
roles, like Ed Harris (“Pollock”), 
Martin Sheen (“Badlands”), Paul 
Sorvino 
(“Goodfellas”), 
Alec 

Baldwin (“Still Alice”) and Candice 
Bergen (“Gandhi”), to name a 
few. A scene with Steve Coogan 
(“The Trip”) is riotously funny. 
Ehrenreich and Collins, both 
up-and-coming stars, are the true 
highlights. Arguments between 
the two explode with timeless 
passion and sexual urgency.

“Rules Don’t Apply” is stuffed 

with the thematic material — 
religiosity, 
capitalism, 
gender, 

psychology, wealth — that could 
make the film truly special, but 
Beatty doesn’t go all the way. 
What’s missing is some unifying 
theory, some answer, to the 
eternal question of Hughes: what 
really made him so crazy? Hughes 
fascinates Beatty, like the rest of 
us, but “Rules Don’t Apply” doesn’t 
resolve any confusion. That’s not 
to say every good film has to have 
a 
well-constructed 
argument, 

but when a modern master takes 
nearly 20 years between his films, 
it’s reasonable to expect better.

That bone structure thooooough.

There was a time when we

Hannah Montana and Emma

unfair 
to

Emma’s

to

Harry

franchise. 

Sometimes, 
drastic 
changes 

are necessary to paint an actor 
in a different light and give 
them the room to explore a new 
character. Maybe that’s what 
“Downton Abbey” ’s Michelle 
Dockery thought she needed 
when she signed on for TNT’s 
“Good Behavior,” because there’s 
nothing quite like seeing Lady 
Mary smoke out of a DIY crack 
pipe to send the message that she’s 
done with the 20th century.

Dockery’s 
performance 
as 

Lady Mary in “Downton Abbey” 
is iconic: with her icy beauty, 
witty remarks and effortless sex 
appeal, she elevates a character 
separated by an entire century 
to someone acutely relevant to 
the modern viewer. She can do 
more with a perfectly manicured 
raise of an eyebrow than some 

can with an entire monologue. 
As the British actress steps into a 
drastically different role as junkie 
ex-con Letty Raines, exchanging 
corsets for plunging jumpsuits 
and pointed upper-class English 
snobbery 
for 
a 
meandering 

Southern drawl, something goes 

missing. It’s more 
than 
just 
the 

initial shock of 
watching 
Lady 

Mary — I mean, 
Letty Raines — 
puke in someone’s 
driveway 
with 

a bad hangover. 
The 
biggest 

disappointment 
of Dockery’s new 

role is not in her performance — 
which is emotional and believable 
and touching — but rather the 
show’s inherent structure, or 
rather lack thereof.

As Letty, Dockery steps into a 

role of a broken women, separated 
from her eight-year-old son by 
a restraining order, addicted to 
drugs and back to her old ways 
of stealing booze and designer 
clothes from expensive hotel 
rooms. She’s the “bad-ass with 
baggage,” but this isn’t enough 
to create a complex and enticing 
female lead. Letty is unstable 
and emotional, characteristics 
that lend well to establishing 
an immediate sympathy to her 
and her situation. However, it’s 
ultimately her flexible moral 
compass and often unmotivated 

decisions 
that 
alienate 
her 

character. The story has striking 
loopholes: 
Letty 
knowingly 

seduces a contracted assassin 
Javier (Juan Diego Botto, “Zorro”) 
only to decide to warn the target 
the next morning, then retreats 
again after shakily pointing a 
shotgun at the assassin/one-
night-stand. 
Her 
emotional 

trajectory is manic, illuminating 
jarring inconsistencies in plot and 
character.

As a result of her unpredictable 

inclinations to occasionally do the 
right thing, Letty is sucked into a 
dangerous relationship with Javier. 
For some unexplained reason, 
Javier decides that he needs Letty 
to help with his assassinations and 
now “owns” her with the promise 
of getting her son back. Their love 
affair is supposed to be hot and 
steamy, but falls flat with the lack 
of genuine connection.

“Good 
Behavior,” 
however, 

is cinematically engaging. The 
camera doesn’t shy away from 
moving into distorted images, 
going out of focus as Letty falls 
off the wagon, and successfully 
builds suspense with extended 
shots scored in complete silence. 
Without thinking too hard or too 
long on its inconsistencies, the 
series is objectively entertaining; 
the fast-paced action translates 
well on screen and the camera 
naturally loves Dockery. But only 
time will tell whether “Good 
Behavior” is able to stick around 
for the long haul.

OLUMBUS — The play 
was called 29 lead.

Curtis Samuel took a 

handoff going left. His blockers 
created 
a 

tunnel. 
He 

burst through 
it, 
jumped 

over 
the 

goal line and 
stretched his 
hands as wide 
as he could 
to the fans in 
the north end 
zone.

It may go down in history 

as one of the enduring plays in 
one of college football’s great 
rivalries — not because it was 
exceptionally drawn up (though 
it was), but because it ended an 
iconic game that may outlive 
those who saw it live.

The nation’s No. 2 team beat 

the No. 3 team, and then fans 
stormed the field. That doesn’t 
happen in games where the 
home team is favored. But this 
was Ohio State and Michigan, 

with the highest stakes in a 
decade. No celebration was 
unworthy.

That’s the significance of 

what happened at Ohio Stadium 
on Saturday: Ohio State 30, 
Michigan 27.

There will be time to rehash 

what was or wasn’t. Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh offered 
plenty of thoughts in the moments 
following the game, when he said 
he was “bitterly disappointed” 
with the officiating. He thought 
one hold went uncalled, one 
pass-interference 
was 
called 

unjustly and one spot — on fourth 
down in double overtime, no less 
— should have given his team a 
victory. None of it matters. None 
of it’s changing.

It took two overtimes for the 

Buckeyes to beat Michigan, but 
they did it. They twisted the 
most jagged of knives through 
the hearts of those who dared 
to hope. They did it in the last 
game of the regular season, and 
they did it in a year where the 
Wolverines looked like one of 

the nation’s four 
best teams.

Ohio 
State 

coach Urban 
Meyer called 
it an instant 
classic, and 
he’s 
right. 

Harbaugh 
said 
the 

implications 
of the rivalry 
weren’t on his 
mind. Both are 
probably 
true. 

That’s 
because 

instant 
classics 

don’t happen without 
heartbreak, 
“bitter 

disappointment” 
or 

whatever you’d like to 
call it. The ingredients 
of despair and ecstasy are 
exactly the same.

In his postgame press 

conference, 
Harbaugh 

stuck up his hands and 
showed how far from the 
first down he thought J.T. 
Barrett was on a double-

overtime 
4th-and-1. With 
Ohio 
State 

down 
three, 

Barrett rushed 
forward, 
took 

low 
contact 

from 
Delano 

Hill, 
and 

stretched 
toward 
the 

first-down 
marker.

Afterward, 

Harbaugh asked 

reporters what they 
saw on the TVs 
upstairs. 
“Short,” 

they 
agreed. 
The 

referees 
did 
not. 

They 
saw 
Barrett 

collide into Hill and 
fall just over the line 
of gain. The replay 
officials did not see 
enough to overturn 
it. That’s how these 
things go. Harbaugh 
has a legitimate gripe, 
but legitimate gripes are 

worth exactly zero wins.

Instead, 
they 
are 
worth 

years, even decades, of anguish. 
Harbaugh 
may 
be 
able 
to 

eventually rid himself of that 
burden with other games, other 
calls that do go his way and 
maybe even a championship. 
But he will never be able to undo 
what happened on the north side 
of Ohio Stadium on Saturday.

His team might have avoided 

it by gaining more than just 
five yards in the fourth quarter, 
or not committing one of its 
three turnovers, one of which 
occurred at the Buckeyes’ 1-yard 
line. But it’s too late for all that. 
Nothing will ever change the 
outcome. The game will be 
preserved, exactly the way it 
unfolded, for eternity.

After Harbaugh expressed 

his displeasures, Meyer held 
court in the southeast corner 
of the stadium. It couldn’t have 
been 
more 
different. 
There 

was Meyer, the victor, entirely 
flummoxed. He was asked all 
kinds of questions, including 

what he thought his chances 
were when his team was down 
17-7 in the third quarter.

“I don’t know,” he responded. 

“We won the game.”

As the questions continued, 

Meyer found refuge in a clever 
response. 
Asked 
about 
an 

unsuccessful fake punt call, 
he said: “On the last play, we 
ran a stretch to the left. It’s 
29 lead, is the call, and Curtis 
scored.” Asked about his health, 
he started, “Curtis…” before 
laughter finished the sentence 
for him. On if he remembered 
anything from after the game: 
“Yeah, Curtis scored.”

It was that simple for Meyer. 

Harbaugh didn’t even mention 
the play.

That’s the difference between 

being on the winning and losing 
ends of a game like Saturday’s. 
Harbaugh is left looking back on 
what went wrong, remembering 
the calls that could have been 
different. Meyer doesn’t have 
to remember anything. History 
will do it for him.

‘The Game’ lives up to the hype

J

ust after 10 a.m. Saturday, 
Jim Harbaugh led his 
Michigan football team 

off the buses 
and walked 
through the 
gates of Ohio 
Stadium.

Harbaugh 

said Monday 
that he had 
not been 
back since he 
last played 
quarterback 
there in 1986. 
He did not say much else about 
his team’s biggest rivalry.

Does he embrace the rivalry 

with Ohio State? “I do.” Does 
he enjoy it? “I do.” Does he 
look forward to it? “Yes.” What 
makes him look forward to it? 
“Competition. That’s the best 
part about it.”

It was always obvious that the 

rivalry known as “The Game” is 
more serious, more intense and 
more important than any other, 
no matter what sense Harbaugh 
gave in the media. Saturday’s 
unforgettable double-overtime 
thriller was just another example 
of that. Sometimes you end up on 
the wrong end of those games, 
like Michigan did Saturday. But 
you can’t say “The Game” wasn’t 
fun, and that’s good for everyone.

Since he arrived at Michigan 

almost two years ago, Harbaugh 
has been coy about hyping up 
the Ohio State rivalry above the 
others. We don’t know too much 
about how he treats it on a week-
to-week basis.

Here’s what we do know 

about Harbaugh: He knows 
how to motivate his team for 
the biggest game of the year, his 
comments in press conferences 
notwithstanding.

Senior safety Dymonte 

Thomas said Harbaugh will drop 
motivational quotes to show the 
significance of his team’s next 

game. Last Monday, before a 
team meeting, Harbaugh gave the 
players one quote in particular 
— “I can’t say it, because it had a 
little word in it,” Thomas joked — 
that stuck out to them.

“I can’t say the word, but it was 

something about how you can’t be 
something for the rest of your life, 
or in your whole life,” Thomas 
said. “He just said, you kind of 
look at it, we haven’t beaten them 
in so long. So he said it’s time for 
us to stand up and stick up and do 
something for yourselves.

“You have a bully, and he 

continues to bully you each and 
every day. And in order for you 
to get that bully to stop bullying 
you, what do you gotta do? You 
gotta go in there and punch 
him right in the nose. And you 
gotta continue to punch him in 
the nose until he don’t want no 
more.”

Ohio State has bullied 

Michigan for more than a 
decade. The Wolverines entered 
Saturday having lost 11 of their 
past 12 games to their archrival, 
and a few of them weren’t close, 
including Harbaugh’s first as 
head coach last year. In that 
game at Michigan Stadium, the 
Buckeyes did what they pleased 
offensively, trampling Michigan 
for 369 rushing yards and 42 
points in the rivalry’s most 
lopsided game since the Rich 
Rodriguez era.

Saturday in Columbus, the 

Wolverines did what Harbaugh 
urged them to do on Monday: 
They went in there and punched 
Ohio State right in the nose. 
They dominated the game for 
three quarters, allowing the 
Buckeyes just 24 total yards 
from the end of their first drive 
until halftime and leading for all 
but 3:46 of regulation.

Michigan just didn’t have 

enough punches in the end, 
when Ohio State survived with 
a 30-27 victory. But it was clear 

the Wolverines heard Harbaugh’s 
message.

Here’s what else we know 

about Harbaugh: He has just 
the right makeup to make that 
motivation mean something.

Monday, a reporter from 

The Columbus Dispatch asked 
Harbaugh to describe himself, 
saying that some people call him 
crazy and some call him “crazy 
like a fox.” Harbaugh wasn’t 
receptive to the question. He 
doesn’t talk about himself: “I 
don’t know that my personality 
really, how relevant that will 
be to the ballgame this week. 
Probably irrelevant.”

His players know what they 

see, though, and when asked 
the same question, fifth-year 
senior defensive lineman Chris 
Wormley had an interesting 
insight.

“I think with all the good 

coaches, you gotta be wired 
a little differently,” Wormley 
said. “A lot of the great ones do 
things differently. I’m sure (Ohio 
State coach Urban) Meyer does 
and has done things differently, 
successful coach. With Coach 
Harbaugh, he does things 
differently.”

Few can deny that. A year ago, 

Harbaugh’s team lost by four 
touchdowns against an Ohio 
State program that has been the 
class of the Big Ten for the five 
years Meyer has been in charge of 
it. Over the past year, everything 
Harbaugh did — the grueling 
four-week bowl camp, the Spring 
Break trip to Florida, the month-
long satellite camp tour, the all-
out quarterback competition, the 
dominant early-season victories 
— it all prepared Michigan to go 
into Ohio Stadium and finally 
knock off the Buckeyes.

Even once the season started, 

the Wolverines were preparing 
for this game. They kept their 
starters as fresh as any group in 
the country. They tested all of the 

weapons they would need. They 
installed a formation with nine 
players in a straight line behind 
the center. They did everything, 
and then they gave Ohio State all 
they had.

Which brings us to the last 

thing we know about Harbaugh. 
Not that there was any doubt 
about the importance of “The 
Game” in the mind of the coach 
who grew up in Michigan, played 
quarterback for Michigan, 
idolized Bo Schembechler and 
once guaranteed that his team 
would beat Ohio State before it 
actually did, but Saturday showed 
that significance all the same.

Before the game, Harbaugh 

went through warmup drills 
with the quarterbacks, catching 

their passes like he always does. 
Then, he engaged in a cordial 
handshake with Meyer, for 
whom he has, by all accounts, 
tremendous respect.

But when the whistle blew, 

Harbaugh was emotional and 
tenacious. He grew more irate 
than ever at the officials, though 
admittedly in a game where 
there were more controversial 
calls than ever. And then he 
slammed them in his postgame 
press conference, saying he was 
“bitterly disappointed” — to use 
a Schembechler phrase, for good 
measure.

It is not a good look for 

Harbaugh to come into his 
postgame press conference and 
spend almost the entirety of 

it criticizing the officiating. It 
may cost him a fine from the 
Big Ten if the conference makes 
a ruling Monday morning. It 
may even cost him some points 
with the all-important College 
Football Playoff committee this 
week when the members decide 
Michigan’s postseason fate.

But that was Jim Harbaugh’s 

rivalry week, for better and 
worse. In an era many have 
trumpeted as the second coming 
of Schembechler and Woody 
Hayes’ “Ten-Year War,” Saturday 
proved to be quite a second battle.

Perhaps Harbaugh won’t say 

it. Perhaps it won’t quite measure 
up next year. But “The Game” is 
“The Game” again, and let’s all be 
grateful for that.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh prepared his team all year to play “The Game” again, and it lived up to the billing.

JAKE

Michigan falls to No. 1 
Nebraska in four sets 

The 
No. 
18 
Michigan 

volleyball team was on a 6-1 
scoring run, trailing No. 1 
Nebraska in the fourth set. 
Scrappy defensive plays gave 
the Wolverines the edge in the 
waning points, but they had 
already fallen too far behind to 
catch up to the Cornhuskers.

The 
deciding 
point 
was 

a Nebraska kill by Mikaela 
Foecke, which went off the 
Michigan block and landed 
out of bounds, securing the 
Cornhuskers a 3-1 win and the 
Big Ten championship.

Nebraska 
(18-2 
Big 
Ten, 

27-2 overall) seemed to be in 
control of the 
match 
from 

the start. The 
Wolverines (11-
9, 22-10) only 
secured 
their 

first lead in the 
beginning of the 
third set. The 
Cornhuskers 
held 
Michigan 

to 
just 
a 

.020 
hitting 

percentage in the first set, 
meager compared to their .139.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

stepped up their offense in the 
second set, their defense paid 
the price. The Cornhuskers 
dominated with a .500 hitting 
percentage and easily took the 
set, 25-17.

Michigan 
went 
into 
the 

break down 0-2, and it had to 
make some adjustments if it 
hoped to come back against a 
strong Nebraska team.

It came into the third set 

on a roll and, following an ace 
from fifth-year senior outside 
hitter 
Kelly 
Murphy, 
the 

Cornhuskers called a timeout. 
The timeout proved ineffective 
for Nebraska, though, as the 
Wolverines came back with a 
4-0 run.

It seemed as if Michigan 

was going to force a fourth set 

easily, but the Cornhuskers 
kept the Wolverines on their 
toes by saving six set points. 
Fortunately 
for 
Michigan, 

sophomore outside hitter Carly 
Skjodt ended the set with a kill 
that hit off the Nebraska block 
and landed out of bounds.

The Wolverines fell behind 

quickly in the fourth set. 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 
tried to slow the Cornhuskers’ 
momentum 
by 
calling 

timeouts, and even by getting 
a net violation overturned, but 
Nebraska was too effective on 
all sides of the ball. Michigan 
fell in the fourth set, 25-21.

Junior middle blocker Claire 

Kieffer-Wright impressed not 
only in Saturday’s match, but 

also throughout 
the 
season. 

Kieffer-Wright 
finished 
the 

match with 13 
kills 
and 
has 

proven she will 
be an important 
player for the 
Wolverines 
in 

the postseason.

“She’s 
been 

one 
of 
our 

most 
consistent 
performers 

offensively,” Rosen said. “And 
not only her execution side 
of the ball, but I think her 
personality and her leadership 
has been great.”

Despite the loss to Nebraska, 

the Wolverines finished with 
a winning Big Ten record – a 
good sign with the postseason 
on the horizon. They will 
enter the NCAA Tournament 
as the No. 12 overall seed, 
which is a testament to the 
stiff competition they’ve faced 
throughout their conference 
play. They will face American 
in the first round on their home 
court at Crisler Center.

“I think we’ve gotten a lot 

better because of the strong 
competition and now we go to 
postseason really prepared,” 
said Rosen. “We’ll try and take 
it one match at a time.”

Fourth-quarter struggles prove costly

COLUMBUS — Jourdan Lewis 

scooped up the squib kick and ran.

If he could find the right holes 

and cut the perfect path, he would 
give the Wolverines their first win 
over the Buckeyes in five years. 
After 
a 
disappointing 
fourth 

quarter that saw No. 3 Michigan 
go three-and-out on all three of 
its possessions and collect just five 
total yards while No. 2 Ohio State 
(8-1 Big Ten, 11-1 overall) found 
new life through quarterback J.T. 
Barrett, Lewis had the chance to 
save the day.

He sprinted down the field as 

Ohio State fans who had assumed 
overtime held their breath. There 
was no time left on the clock, and 
with the game tied at 17, anything 
could happen. Lewis cut left across 
the field after weaving through 
defenders for 40 yards, and then, 
finally, the Horseshoe exhaled. 
Cornerback 
Joshua 
Norwood 

took him down on the Buckeyes’ 
43-yard line, and the game would 

indeed go to overtime.

As Lewis picked himself up, he 

shook his head in disappointment 
of what could have been. His run 
was a fitting cap to a disastrous 
quarter, and Ohio State would 
retain its momentum through two 
overtimes, ultimately coming up 
victorious, 30-27.

The 
game 
didn’t 
have 
to 

end in disappointment for the 
Wolverines, though. Had they 
continued to play the way they 
did throughout the first three 
quarters, the Buckeyes would have 
needed much more to win.

“We were just playing lights out 

that first three and a half quarters,” 
said defensive end Chris Wormley. 
“They got some plays, they have 
good players — I mean, they go to 
Ohio State, they have good players. 
So, we need to make a few plays at 
the end and the outcome probably 
would have been a little different, 
but I thought we played pretty well 
for the most part of the game.”

The Wolverines headed to the 

locker room at halftime with a 
10-7 lead after pure defensive 

domination held the Buckeyes to 
just 81 offensive yards in the first 
half. Ohio State had converted only 
one of seven third-down attempts, 
and J.T. Barrett was 5-for-11 for no 
touchdowns. The Buckeyes’ lone 
score came off a 16-yard pick-six 
by Malik Hooker.

But Ohio State looked minimally 

better after the break, and then 
like a completely different team 
in the final quarter. In the fourth 
quarter alone, Barrett rushed for 
71 yards and threw for another 59, 
and running back Curtis Samuel 
caught two passes for 23 yards.

“J.T. didn’t start out very good,” 

said Ohio State coach Urban 
Meyer. “We had some misfires. 
We weren’t playing very well. … 
We had some protection issues. 
And the pass game is a constant. 
It’s either protection issues or 
a misfiring, and I thought the 
receivers played decent. … They 
just keep swinging. It’s a very, very 
good defense we faced.”

Meanwhile, Michigan’s offense 

stopped producing. All three of 
its 
fourth-quarter 
possessions 

amounted to just 3:53 of game 
time, allowing Barrett to wear 
out the defense further. Cracks in 
the Wolverines’ defensive armor 
began to show as the Buckeyes 
gained seven first downs in the 
fourth quarter (Michigan had 
none) and 127 yards.

Both units faltered in the final 

frame, but the Wolverines thought 
their defense was strong enough to 
lead its team to victory.

“It’s a bummer, you know,” said 

redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight. “I feel like I let the 
defense down with the game that 
they played. It stings.”

When asked if he thought 

Michigan played well enough to 
win, he responded right away.

“Yeah, absolutely.”
But as he said it, Buckeye cheers 

traveled from the concourse and 
permeated through the walls of 
the press room 45 minutes after 
the end of the game.

The Wolverines may have 

done enough to win in the first 
three quarters, but not in the 
fourth.

Michigan beats Mount St. Mary’s

No 
matter 
how 
intricate 

a team’s offense may be — 
and John Beilein’s scheme is 
certainly 
among 
the 
most 

complex 
— the system can only work if 
players are making shots.

So when No. 25 Michigan 

shot just 19.2 percent from the 
field against South Carolina on 
Wednesday, including a dismal 
7.7 percent from behind the 
arc, the offense could only be 
described as sluggish.

That certainly wasn’t the 

case early Saturday night, when 
the Wolverines returned to 
Crisler Center to beat Mount St. 
Mary’s, 64-47.

Michigan (5-1) got off to a 

blistering start — shooting 7-15 
on 3-pointers and 43.3 percent 
on all field goals — to stake 
themselves with a comfortable 
lead after a slow defensive start.

“It was huge,” said senior 

guard Zak Irvin. “After how 
poorly we shot the ball in South 
Carolina, we definitely wanted 
to come out and set the tone. 
Big bounce-back game for us, 
so it was nice to see the first 
three of my shots go in. It was a 
good feeling.”

The Mountaineers, led by 

nine early points from 5-foot-5 
guard Junior Robinson, took an 
early 12-8 lead in the first half.

But 
then 
junior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman 
knocked 
down 
a 

3-pointer, 
senior 
forward 

Duncan Robinson hit a midrange 
jumper and senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. drained another 3 to 
give Michigan a lead it would 
not relinquish for the rest of the 
night.

The Wolverines ended the 

first half on a 25-4 run that 
was capped off by a personal 

seven-point spurt from Moritz 
Wagner, 
during 
which 
the 

sophomore forward’s offensive 
arsenal was on full display. 
Wagner drained 3-pointers with 
ease and took defenders off the 
dribble, creating 
hesitation 
with 

an 
array 
of 

pump-fakes and 
jab steps.

After 
the 

Mountaineers 
opened up the 
second half with 
a quick 6-2 run 
to cut Michigan’s 
lead to 12, the 
Wolverines 
responded 
in 
kind 
off 
the 

strength of three more 3-pointers 
from Robinson and redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson.

The 
improved 
shooting 

was 
even 
more 
impressive 

considering Mount St. Mary’s 
entered the game allowing its 
opponents to make just 29.9 of 
their long-range attempts.

While Michigan shot well 

throughout 
the 
game, 

finishing with a 
43.6 
field-goal 

percentage and 
a 40.7 3-point 
percentage, 
the 
Wolverines 

struggled 
with 

turnovers. 
A 

sloppy 
few 

minutes toward 
the end of the 

game saw Mount St. Mary’s cut 
Michigan’s lead to just eight, 
bringing the Mountaineer bench 
to life.

But Irvin, who finished with 

14 points, stemmed the tide 
with a mid-range jumper from 
the elbow that seemed to snap 
his team out of its funk, and 
Michigan finished the game on 
an 11-2 run.

“(Mount St. Mary’s) fought 

hard,” Irvin said. “They cut 
it back to, I think it was eight 
points, with four or five minutes 
to go, so for us to end it on an 
11-2 run is huge. We always talk 
about finishing strong, and I was 
glad to play a part in that.”

Added Beilein: “We have a 

big game with Virginia Tech on 
Wednesday. We get a day to rest. 
For us to travel to South Carolina 
... (we) learned some valuable 
lessons from that game. And 
then to have this challenge right 
now, it was a bigger challenge 
than anyone would think, so 
we’ll take the ‘W.’ ”

ICE HOCKEY
Michigan salvages 
series split at Yost

Freshman 
forward 
James 

Sanchez’s 
goal 
came 
out 
of 

nowhere. One second, everyone 
was 
watching 
two 
Lake 

Superior State players pass the 
puck. The next, Sanchez had 
taken the puck from the pass and 
shot it into the Lakers’ net for the 
Wolverines’ third goal of the night.

This goal led to No. 16 Michigan 

avenging a 3-1 loss to Lake 
Superior State (7-6-0) on Friday. 
The Wolverines (5-5-1) turned the 
tables on the Lakers, cruising to a 
4-1 victory Saturday.

The contrast between the first 

period of both games couldn’t 
have been stronger. Where the 
Lakers outshot the Wolverines on 
Friday (8-6), Michigan dominated 
the first period Saturday, 12-5. 
Friday, it took the Wolverines 
the entire first period to get into 
motion, but Saturday, it only took 
them four minutes to score their 
first goal.

One of the similarities between 

the two games, though, came 
from who scored that goal. 
Junior forward Tony Calderone 
scored both first goals — this 
time, though, the goal came four 
minutes into the first period, when 
a knot of Lakers and Wolverines 
formed in front of Lake Superior 
State’s goal. Calderone managed 
to push the puck into the net to 
put the Wolverines up, 1-0.

“Obviously, we lost a lot of 

scoring (last year), so someone’s 
gotta step up,” Calderone said. 
“I’m just trying to do my best to 
fill the role, but I know (those) 
are pretty big shoes to fill, but I’m 
trying my best and we’ll see how 
it goes.”

However, Laker forward C.J. 

Hayes canceled out Calderone’s 
goal with one of his own at the 

15:17 
mark. 
Diego 
Cuglietta 

brought the puck down the ice 
and close to the net on senior 
goaltender 
Zach 
Nagelvoort’s 

right, and passed it to Hayes on 
Nagelvoort’s left at the last minute 
to score the goal.

The second period featured 

the same intensity as the first, 
with no break from either team. 
Junior defenseman Sam Piazza 
attempted a goal with a clean shot 
directly in front of the net, but 
Lake Superior State goaltender 
Gordon Defiel denied it with his 
arm. Laker forward J.T. Henke 
came close to a goal as he wrapped 
behind Michigan’s goal to tuck 
the puck into the net, but overshot 
it in front of Nagelvoort instead.

It was finally senior defenseman 

Nolan De Jong who was able to 
break the tie off an assist from 
sophomore 
forward 
Brendan 

Warren. Warren snagged the puck 
and passed it to De Jong, who 
managed a clean shot directly past 
Defiel to push the Wolverines to 
2-1 at the 9:16 mark.

Lake Superior State attempted 

to close the gap multiple times 
throughout the remainder of 
the second period, but with no 
luck. Laker forward Jake Hand 
brought the puck close to the net, 
but Nagelvoort made a quick glove 
save to keep the Wolverines’ one-
goal advantage headed into the 
third period.

Like Friday, Saturday’s game 

boiled down to the final period. 
But this time, it favored Michigan.

Sanchez’s goal pushed the 

Wolverines to a two-goal lead, one 
that the Lakers couldn’t break. 
Sophomore defenseman Nicholas 
Boka also managed to replicate 
the Lakers’ empty-net goal Friday, 
as he scored one with 49 seconds 
remaining in the game. And with 
no additional goals from the 
Lakers, the Wolverines switched 
places with Lake Superior State to 
claim a 4-1 victory.

Wolverines finish 2-1 in Paradise Jam

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has made its 
mark in the record book early 
this season, scoring over 100 
points in three straight games 
for the first time and going on 
a jaw-dropping 52-point run 
against Howard.

But this weekend at the 

Paradise Jam in the Virgin 
Islands, the Wolverines finally 
met their match. They swept 
past 
No. 
25 
Gonzaga 
and 

Winthrop at the beginning of 
the tournament, and ended 
with their biggest game of the 
season thus far against No. 10 
Florida State.

Michigan couldn’t advance 

its winning streak to seven 
games, falling to the Seminoles, 
76-62, in the Wolverines’ third 
game of the weekend.

“I definitely thought that we 

got worn down a little bit,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “We played against a 
really great team, and for a long 
period of time we were really 
even with them.”

Early in the game, Michigan 

went down, 8-2, and spent the 
remaining seven minutes of 
the first period playing catch-
up. The Wolverines spread the 
scoring out, with freshman 
guard 
Kysre 
Gondrezick 

coming off the bench at the 
5:11 mark and contributing five 
points. After the first quarter, 
Michigan trailed by only one.

In 
the 
second 
quarter, 

Michigan earned its first lead of 
the game thanks to a 3-pointer 
and jumper by junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty, but wasn’t 
able to maintain it. Florida 
State’s scoring was relentless, 
and by halftime, the Wolverines 
were once again down, 32-28.

Then, 15 second-half fouls 

killed Michigan’s momentum. 
The 
Seminoles 
never 
gave 

up the lead, despite double-
digit efforts from Flaherty (18 

points), Gondrezick (17) and 
sophomore 
forward 
Hallie 

Thome (13).

“They’re a top-10 team, so 

they’re used to having these 
games,” Thome said. “They’re 
able to handle themselves and 
all the pressure and not freak 
out. Towards the end, unlike 
Gonzaga, 
when 
we 
played 

them we were able to handle 
ourselves and play with ease. 
I think for Florida State, we 
kind of just let it go. It could’ve 
been because we were mentally 
fatigued, so instead of just being 
on point with everything we 
kind of got a little freaked out.”

Added Flaherty: “Coming out 

of that game we need to work 
on a lot of things. Especially 
defense, 
not 

fouling so much 
towards 
the 

end, and then 
offensively, 
executing plays, 
not having as 
many turnovers. 
Those 
helped 

their tempo of 
the game.”

While 
the 

Wolverines’ 
first loss wasn’t how they 
would’ve liked to end the 
tournament, there were still 
plenty of positives throughout 
the 
weekend. 
Thome 
and 

Flaherty were both named to 
the all-tournament team, and 
Michigan notched its first win 
against a top-25 team since 
2014.

Friday vs. Winthrop (1-6): 

Friday’s game against Winthrop 
could 
have 
been 
another 

opportunity for Michigan to hit 
the century mark. Instead, the 
Wolverines fell 24 points shy 
of that number, but still won, 
76-39. Even with the impressive 
margin, Barnes Arico was still 
not satisfied.

 “We couldn’t get going,” 

Barnes Arico said. “It took us 
definitely that first quarter to 
get going. I thought our second 

team really came in and gave us 
that energy and that burst that 
we needed.”

Michigan went deep into 

the bench, allowing all four 
freshmen 
onto 
the 
court. 

Munger 
and 
Brozoski 
also 

played, with 22 and 21 minutes, 
respectively. 
Munger 
scored 

11 points, breaking into double 
digits to join Thome, who had 
12, and Flaherty, who scored 17.

Despite their strong scoring, 

the 
Wolverines 
weren’t 

performing at their peak.

“We 
talked 
about 
it 
at 

halftime,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We were short … everyone 
besides Hallie on all of their 
shots. But I didn’t mind that 
as much as I minded our 

energy and our 
turnovers. 
We 

talked 
about 

turnovers, 
we 

wanted to hold 
it to six and 
we had 11, and 
we said in the 
second half we 
wanted to try 
to keep it under 
five. And I think 
we did.”

Thursday vs. No. 25 Gonzaga 

(4-2): Going into Thursday’s 
game, the Wolverines were 
facing their first ranked team 
of the season after a long flight. 
Still, they came out on top, 
beating the Bullldogs, 78-66.

Michigan has struggled in 

the first few minutes of play 
in its last two home games, 
going 
down 
6-0 
against 

both Western Michigan and 
Howard. But against Gonzaga, 
the 
Wolverines 
showed 
up 

to play. After two minutes, 
Michigan was up 9-2, thanks to 
five points from Flaherty, two 
from Thome and two more from 
senior guard Danielle Williams.

Those three got the ball 

rolling 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 

and they never let up, leading 
the game for the entire 40 
minutes. Flaherty went off in 

the first half, tallying 17 points 
and ending the game with a 
team-high 22 points. She also 
tacked on seven assists to tie 
her career high. Senior guard 
Siera Thompson ran the court 
as well, scoring 21 points and 
going 5-for-6 on 3-pointers. She 
now has more 3-pointers than 
any Wolverine in history.

The closest Gonzaga came 

to taking the lead was in the 
fourth quarter, when Michigan 
led by just four points.

“We had a lot of games like 

last year that came down to 
the final minutes,” Thome 
said. “And this year we were 
able to beat the stats and just 
push through it. … It was just 
exciting to see that we were 
able to finish games when it 
came down to the last final 
minutes.”

While 
Thompson 
and 

Flaherty show up in the box 
score as the difference makers, 
the players coming off the 
bench were a huge factor in the 
Wolverines’ win.

“I 
think 
(sophomore 

guard Boogie Brozoski) and 
(sophomore 
guard 
Nicole 

Munger) 
really 
stood 
out, 

especially 
the 
first 
game,” 

Flaherty said. “Munger hit a big 
3 in the corner and had a charge. 
Boogie has just been a great 
spark off the bench, she knows 
how to control the game and get 
everyone involved. I think she 
brings a swag to our team and 
makes us a lot tougher.”

The road trips aren’t coming 

to an end, either.

Coming off of the weekend, 

Michigan 
will 
practice 
for 

three days before jetting off to 
face Georgia Tech in Atlanta.

“We’re going to take it game 

by game,” Thome said. “We’re 
going to be road warriors and 
just do what we usually do. … It 
doesn’t matter what gym we’re 
in or how many hours we’ve been 
on flights. It’s definitely a fun 
experience, but it is a tiring one, 
and I think we’re ready for it.”

The good, the bad and 
the ugly: Ohio State

For 
as 
heartbreaking 
as 

the Michigan football team’s 
30-27 double-overtime defeat 
in Columbus was, there were 
plenty of joyful moments for 
Wolverine fans at Ohio Stadium. 
For the first three quarters of the 
game, it seemed as if Michigan 
would be able to cruise to victory 
the potency of its defense.

It would have been difficult 

to predict what happened in the 
fourth quarter and in overtime, 
but quarterback J.T. Barett and 
running back Curtis Samuel 
breathed new life into the 
Buckeyes while the Wolverines 
floundered.

The Daily breaks down the 

good, bad and ugly moments 
from No. 3 Michigan’s loss to 
No. 2 Ohio State.

The good

It 
really 
seemed 
like 

Michigan’s defense did all it 
could to secure Michigan’s 
first victory over Ohio State 
in five years. Safety Malik 
Hooker provided the Buckeyes’ 
lone touchdown of the first 
half, bailing out his offense by 
snagging redshirt sophomore 
Wilton 
Speight’s 
pass 
and 

taking it 16 yards to the house.

The 
Buckeyes’ 
offense 

sputtered to just 81 first-half 
yards, and Barrett struggled 
with his passing game in that 
frame as well, throwing 5-for-
11 for just 40 yards under 
Michigan’s constant pressure. 
Barrett was sacked eight times 
total, but he was able to step up 
his game in the fourth quarter 
when his team needed it most.

We’re placing Wilton Speight 

in the “good” category for now 
(more on that later) due to 
his performance following an 
injury that kept him out of the 
Indiana game last week. If any 
pain still lingered, he did a good 
job of playing through it, as he 
went 23-for-36 passing for 219 
yards and two touchdowns. In 
one of his more impressive plays 
on Saturday, he threw a bullet to 
fifth-year senior Amara Darboh 
on 4th-and-goal in the game’s 
first overtime to secure passage 
to a second overtime.

Fifth-year 
senior 
kicker 

Kenny Allen was solid yet again, 
making both of his field-goal 
attempts and averaging 47.4 
yards per punt. He had three 
punts over 50 yards, and had 
a few that pinned Ohio State 
within the 10-yard line.

The bad

Despite Speight’s performance, 

he had to be mentioned again 
in this section for a few crucial 
plays. After Peppers’ interception 
gave the Wolverines great field 
position, Speight fumbled the ball 

on the one-yard line. Speight said 
that there was a communication 
problem between him and the 
center due to the Horseshoe’s 
crowd noise, but that third-
quarter score could have given 
the Wolverines the cushion it 
needed to win.

Speight 
also 
threw 
two 

interceptions, but on his first 
(Hooker’s pick-six), his arm was 
knocked as he launched the ball 
out of the end zone. His second 
pick was less forgivable. Late in 
the third quarter, Jerome Baker 
intercepted his pass and carried 
it all the way to Michigan’s 
13-yard line, setting up Mike 
Weber’s touchdown rush that 
put Ohio State within three 
points of the Wolverines.

Michigan lost all of its 

momentum 
in 
the 
fourth 

quarter, going three-and-out 
on all three of its possessions 
and 
collecting 
just 
five 

offensive yards compared to the 
Buckeyes’ 127.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

started to crack after being 
forced to play for the majority 
of the final frame, and it allowed 
Ohio State to get within field-
goal position twice. Buckeye 
kicker Tyler Durbin missed his 
first 21-yard field-goal attempt, 
but he nailed his second one 
from 23 yards out to send the 
game to overtime.

The ugly

Durbin’s missed field goals 

sent fans into a tizzy. His 
37-yard field goal attempt in 
the first quarter sailed wide left 
after the Buckeyes marched 72 
yards down the field on their 
first possession of the game. 
When he missed the chip shot 
in the fourth quarter, it looked 
like it might cost his team the 
game. He would be able to put it 
all together minutes later when 
it counted most, though.

After the game, Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh said he 
was 
“bitterly 
disappointed” 

with the officiating. He was 
most upset with the spot that 
gave Ohio State a first down in 
the second overtime, opening 
up the gates for Samuel to run 
in a touchdown after Michigan 
was able to just hit a field goal.

Harbaugh also insisted that 

sophomore wide receiver Grant 
Perry was being tackled before 
the ball ever got to him, and the 
pass interference call on senior 
safety Delano Hill looked to be 
uncatchable by the receiver.

Harbaugh was also visibly 

angered 
during 
the 
game, 

throwing his play card toward 
the 
sidelines 
and 
smashing 

his 
headphones 
into 
the 

ground. Michigan received an 
unsportsmanlike conduct for 
that display, which put Ohio 
State on the Wolverines’ four-
yard line. Two plays later, Weber 
would punch in a touchdown.

Five Things We Learned

Have you had time to digest it?
The No. 3 Michigan football 

team fell, 30-27, in a crushing 
double-overtime loss to No. 
2 Ohio State. At 10-2, the 
Wolverines are likely bound for 
the New Year’s Six, and yet they 
are still reeling after a hard-
fought game that will go down 
in history.

Here are five things we 

learned from “The Game”:

1. Michigan couldn’t close it 
out.

The Wolverines dominated 

Ohio State for two and a 
half quarters. They led 17-7 
at one point, and that lead 
would have been larger if 
not for an untimely pick-six 
thrown by redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight. 
But behind a fourth quarter in 
which Michigan gained just 
five yards, the Buckeyes came 
all the way back.

First, 
a 
Jerome 
Baker 

interception late in the third 
quarter 
gave 
the 
Buckeyes 

great field position in the red 
zone. Then, a pair of penalties 
backed the Michigan defense 
up to its own 4-yard line. It is 
noteworthy to understand that 
the Wolverines were stellar on 

defense nearly all day. There is 
a very real chance they could 
have forced a field goal. But they 
didn’t, and the comeback was on.

In 
the 
fourth 
quarter, 

Michigan’s offense just didn’t 
do enough to secure the win. 
Even after Ohio State’s Tyler 
Durbin missed a 21-yard field 
goal, it couldn’t put together 
a clock-killing drive. It had its 
chances, it just couldn’t convert.

2. Wilton Speight is a warrior, 
even in a loss.

Yes, he made a handful of 

mistakes. His two interceptions 
and fumbled snap on the Buckeyes’ 
1-yard line proved costly, and 
there’s no ignoring that.

But 
man, 
Michigan’s 

quarterback sure came up big 
by playing at all. He wouldn’t 
say what his injury was or what 
percentage 
he 
was 
playing 

at, but he couldn’t have been 
feeling completely healthy. So 
yes, the interceptions were 
damning, but the level at which 
he played was still enough to 
give the Wolverines a chance.

He 
finished 
23-of-36 

passing for 219 yards and 
two 
touchdowns, 
even 

without throwing deep. He 
kept 
relatively 
cool 
in 
an 

exceptionally 
difficult 
place 

to play. You certainly can’t 
ask for much more out of a 

player whose status was totally 
uncertain coming in.

3. 
J.T. 
Barrett 
still 
has 

Michigan’s number.

Barrett had been held in 

check all day, but in the fourth 
quarter 
and 
overtime, 
he 

surged. Even if his final carry, 
a play that will live forever, 
appeared to be just short (both 
in person and on video), it 
stood, and it counts as part of 
another strong game for Barrett 
rushing.

His 135 yards on the ground 

came exactly when his team 
needed them, and though he 
was sacked eight times, he 
never seemed rattled. It wasn’t 
his finest game, but it was just 
enough to win.

4. The two best teams in the 
conference aren’t heading to 
Indy.

It’s a weird reality, but it’s 

true. After what happened at 
Ohio Stadium on Saturday, it’s 
tough to argue anything else.

Michigan 
and 
Ohio 
State 

both beat Wisconsin, and the 
Wolverines beat Penn State by 
39. The Nittany Lions beat the 
Buckeyes, but they didn’t beat an 
Ohio State team that looked like 
the one that showed up Saturday.

And yet, Penn State and the 

Badgers are playing for the 
conference title this weekend. 
The winner will have a trophy 
saying it’s the best in the Big 
Ten. 
But 
anyone 
watching 

Saturday’s game could tell you 
that’s probably not enough 
to 
overcome 
the 
eye 
test. 

Michigan and Ohio State are the 
Big Ten’s best, and conference 
commissioner Jim Delaney is 
probably none too happy that 
neither is going to have a chance 
to make that official.

5. Bold Prediction: Jabrill 
Peppers will not get invited 
to New York.

There was a time when 

Peppers looked like a lock 
to be at least a finalist for 
the Heisman Trophy, but his 
candidacy has thinned since.

He 
has 
a 
punt 
return 

touchdown against Colorado, 
two 
rushing 
touchdowns 

against Rutgers and one against 
Michigan State. He’s one of 
the best players in the country, 
and no one is questioning that, 
but without a signature game 
against Ohio State, it will be 
tough to garner an invite.

Peppers 
still 
had 
seven 

tackles and an interception, but 
he was stymied on offense. He 
should still be an All-American. 
But he probably will not get that 
coveted trip to New York.

Wolverines came within striking distance of upset, but couldn’t finish the win

Michigan’s defense delivered a mostly dominant performance Saturday, but the Wolverines allowed a late surge to Ohio State and lost in double overtime.
