The Michigan Daily sat down 

for an interview with E. Royster 
Harper, vice president for student 
life, to discuss several current 
issues on campus, including a 
likely visit from Richard Spencer 
and the addition of a Middle 
Eastern/North African category 
to 
University 
of 
Michigan 

demographic data collection. 

The Daily: The administration 

has been very clear that safety is 
the first priority in negotiations 
with Richard Spencer. Can you 
talk about what the University 
outlines as safety, and how 
it’s taking mental health into 
account?

Harper: I think the University 

is 
thinking 
primarily 
about 

physical safety of everybody 
involved, and that the rest of us 
are thinking about, ‘OK, how 
do we ensure psychological and 
emotional safety?’ And actually, 

we talked with the team down 
at Florida — our director of 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services — about what they 
provide, when they provided it, 
how do you — if the decision is 
made for him to come, how do 
you get people psychologically 
and 
emotionally 
ready 
so 

that it doesn’t have really a 
detrimental 
effect 
on 
their 

mental and emotional health? 
I think the challenge for the 
University is, it’s much clearer 
to think through the issues 
related to physical safety than it 
is emotional and psychological 
safety, because that’s different 
for some students.

TMD: Can you tell me about 

what came out of that conversation 
with the University of Florida?

Harper: For example, one of 

the things that they said in Florida 
is it’s really important to have 
people available before, during 
and after for some students. That 
it’s important to have communal 
spaces where folks can gather. 
But there are some folks who say: 
’I don’t want to be in a communal

Last 
week 
President 

Donald Trump announced the 
United States will recognize 
Jerusalem as the capital of 
Israel, breaking international 
norms, 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 

achieve peace between Israel 
and Palestine, In protest of 
the decision, Students Allied 
for Freedom and Equality and 
Revolutionary Youth Alliance, 
A2/Ypsi organized a speak-out 
Monday night at the Michigan 
Union.

The Trump administration, 

despite widespread criticism 
around 
the 
world, 
will 

recognize Jerusalem as the 
capital of Israel by moving the 
U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv, 
Israel, to Jerusalem.

Students 
addressed 
the 

group of about 25, condemning 
the move by Trump and voicing 
support for Palestinians. Many 
of 
Pro-Palestinian 
student 

chose to not to speak on the 
record out of fear of being 
placed on a blacklist for their 
views.

“We will be gathering by 

the couches of the Union 
for a speak-out protest of 
Trump’s decision to recognize 
Jerusalem as Israel’s capital,” 
the Facebook event description 
read. “This recognition seeks 
to erase the Palestinian people 
and their historical ties to 
Jerusalem. It also dissolves 
current, past, and future peace 

processes, and attempts to 
further legitimize the brutal 
occupation of Palestine.”

LSA 
Student 
Arwa, 
a 

board member of SAFE, who 
requested to not include her 
last name, said the speak-out 
was organized in conjunction 
with speak-outs across the 
country 
to 
better 
inform 

people about the importance 

of Jerusalem for many ethnic 
groups.

“Jerusalem 
is 
a 
very 

important city for all people of 
all faiths — Islam, Christianity 
and Judaism,” Arwa said. “So 
many people, all that they’re 
hearing is the perspective 
from the media and a lot of 
times people get desensitized 
to how personal this city is 

to so many people and that 
was kind of what the speak 
out was about: to understand 
the importance and the long 
history that Jerusalem has 
played for Palestine and for 
Palestinians of all religions.”

One 
recently 
graduated 

Jewish student who wished to 
remain anonymous said that as 

At its last meeting of the year, 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Senate 
Assembly 
invited 

President Mark Schlissel to 
provide remarks on University 
progress and challenges from 
the past semester. Schlissel 
discussed sexual harassment 
on campus, the effect of the 
tax reform bill on graduate 
students and Richard Spencer’s 
impending visit.

“It’s been obviously a really 

challenging 
semester 
on 

campus,” Schlissel said. “The 
challenges largely being around 
social issues, issues of inclusion 
and community occurring in a 
very difficult national political 
moment in the United States.”

Schlissel began by listing 

the series of accomplishments, 
scholarships 
and 
awards 

earned by alumni, students and 
faculty over the past year. He 
underscored the University’s 
$1.48 
billion 
in 
research 

conducted in 2017, resulting in 
it ranking as the second-best 
university in the nation for 
volume of research expenditure

Two of the three people 

suspected to be involved in the 
December 4th armed robbery 
in West Quad were arrested 
on Sunday. The third suspect 
remains at large.

According to a press release 

from the Division of Public 
Safety and Security, Brian White, 
18, of Novi, Mich. and Deandre 
Jetter, 19, of West Bloomfield, 
Mich., were both arraigned on 
four felony counts: two accounts 
of armed robbery, first-degree 
home invasion and larceny in a 
building. The standard sentence 
for armed robbery is a life term, 
while home invasion is a 20-year 
felony and larceny is a 4-year 
felony.

DPSS spokeswoman said last 

week the armed robbery attacked 
three University students, and 
the incident was “not a random 
act of violence.” White, Jetter, 
and the third suspect allegedly 
demanded property from the 
students 
and 
brandished 
a 

handgun.

After historic win on eMerge ticket, Sarkar & Jawad navigate contentious campus climate

After 
spending 
the 
winter 

semester of 2017 campaigning 
for Central Student Government 
leadership on the three pillars 
of 
voice, 
opportunity 
and 

momentum, the eMerge party led 
by President Anushka Sarkar, an 
LSA senior, and Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Public Policy 
senior, has taken several steps 
this semester in fulfilling their 
promises of last spring, including 

passing a number of resolutions 
and initiatives.

Voice
CSG 
has 
participated 
in 

actions this past semester and has 
continued initiatives that work 
aiming to give students greater 
opportunity 
to 
convey 
their 

concerns on campus.

Following 
several 
bias 

incidents and discussion on how 
to best respond to student needs, 
CSG has spent the past several 
months working on amending the 
Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities, which, according 

to an interview with Sarkar 
and Jawad, would include bias-
motivated misconduct as both 
a violation and an aggravating 
factor in the disciplining process, 
and on Friday the first stage in the 
process was passed. The executive 
board also released a statement in 
October condemning the naming 
the namesake building of C.C. 
Little, who was a eugenicist.

“There’s other ways to look 

back at history, but I think when 
we name a building it becomes 
to normalized into our everyday 
systems on campus that we totally 

forget to check in and see what it 
was that that president did or what 
the history entails,” Jawad said 
during an October meeting.

On Nov. 7, CSG held its weekly 

meeting on the Diag as another 
way to elevate student voice, 
particularly 
by 
making 
the 

organization more accessible to 
students — most attended the 
meeting to primarily talk about 
#UMDivest.

In addition, CSG looks to 

continue 
supporting 
students 

on the Ann Arbor City Council

among public universities.

Schlissel also remarked on 

the 
promising 
fundraising 

efforts and growth of the 
University’s endowment, which 
has reached about $11 billion.

“Your university, through 

your efforts, is actually doing 
spectacularly well,” Schlissel 
said. “I wanted to give that 
little bit of a pep talk because 
we’re dealing with challenging 
issues on the campus, but I 
want to be sure we don’t forget 
that our mission is of profound 
importance 
to 
the 
broader 

society, and certainly to our 
fellow citizens and friends 
and neighbors in the state of 
Michigan.”

Afterward, 
he 
fielded 

questions 
about 
various 

challenges facing the University. 
The first question regarded 
the current tax reform bill 
and its provision about taxing 
the tuition waivers that are 
provided to doctoral students. 
Schlissel promised that the 

higher-education 
community 

is lobbying Congress to keep 
this proposal out of the final 
version of the tax code. He 
cautioned that if it did pass, the 
University would only be able 
to financially support affected 
students temporarily.

“I can imagine if there’s a 

very short-term and immediate 
change and our students are in 
big trouble, we can step in and 
help people,” Schlissel said. 
“That’s a short-term, not a 
longer-term solution.”

Schlissel 
heard 
questions 

from faculty members at the 
meeting on sexual assault and 
harassment on campus. He 
affirmed the University has 
clear rules, procedures and 
sanctions in place, but there 
needs to be a culture where 
people have confidence in the 
reporting process.

“We have a scheme which I 

think is a good one,” Schlissel 
said. “What we have to work on 
and share responsibility for is a 
culture in which people who feel 
as if they’ve been discriminated 
against or they’re being treated 
unfairly 
or 
they’re 
being 

harassed … we have to a culture 
where that gets reported and 
people have confidence that it 
would be fairly and sensitively 
investigated and adjudicated.”

Social 
Work 
professor 

Robert Ortega, chair of the 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs 
and 

Senate Assembly, subsequently 
announced that representatives 
from the Office for Institutional 
Equity will be coming to SACUA 
next 
semester 
to 
discuss 

reporting and the culture of 
sexual misconduct.

Schlissel 
then 
fielded 

questions 
about 
Richard 

Spencer’s request to speak on 
campus and the University’s 
response. 
He 
justified 
his 

decision to consider Spencer’s 
request and attempt to find a 
time and location where the 
event could be safely held. He 
cited legal obligations and fear 
over the University violating 
the First Amendment as reasons 
to permit Spencer to speak.

“Imagine the circumstance, 

if, in the not too distant 
future, 
Michigan’s 
behavior 

in 
rejecting 
the 
speaker 

based on content gets used, 
inappropriately, but used by 
others to deny the speech 
rights 
of 
a 
marginalized 

group,” Schlissel said.

Schissel 
added 
that 

granting Spencer permission 
would avoid a lawsuit and give 
the University more leverage 
on the time and location of 
the event.

“The easy thing in the 

short term would’ve been to 
say no; everybody would clap, 
we stood up for our values,” 
Schlissel said. “We’d end up 
in court, we’d lose, we’d have 
much less control over the 
ultimate event and he would 
be a hero and there’d be even a 
larger convening here of very 
challenging people.”

Provost Martin Philbert 

added that the University 
will be sending resources out 
to faculty for them to pass to 
their students who may feel 
particularly 
vulnerable 
in 

light of Spencer speaking.

Student Advisory Committee so 
as to have a representative within 
City Council to speak on issues 
that may not be involved with 
the student government, as well 
as to have a student sit on the 
University of Michigan’s Board of 
Regents, a position that has also 
been pushed for under previous 
administrations — the legality of 
which is ambiguous.

Opportunity
CSG spent this past semester 

working on resolutions aimed 
at increasing accessibility for 
students by means of providing 
resources.

“A lot of resolutions have 

come through the assembly that 
have just sort of been focused on 
making it easier to be a student,” 
Sarkar said.

Five resolutions in particular 

have worked to address these 
needs, and have included the 
funding of charging stations in the 
Shapiro Undergraduate Library, 
increasing the Career Center’s 
Clothes Closet to provide free 
professional clothing for students, 
a calculator loan program and, 
in beginning in January, free 
menstrual products in bathrooms 
across campus.

Momentum 
The assembly looks to build 

upon 
initiatives 
and 
projects 

from 
last 
term 
to 
continue 

supporting programs that assist 
student life. For example, while 
no longer directly advocating 
for the Leadership Engagement 
Scholarship, CSG has continued 
to work on a partnership with 
those organizing the scholarship, 
hoping to have funds available by 
fall 2018.

Housing affordability is another 

issue that began prior to eMerge’s 
time in office, with former CSG 
President 
David 
Schafer 
and 

Vice President Micah Griggs’s 
administration 
passionate 
on 

finding ways to lower Ann Arbor 
housing costs.

Jawad, who assisted in the 

research process that took place 
last year on the issue, explained 
how CSG is continuing work on 
providing students with resources 
to understand where to find less 
expensive housing.

“Last year we did about a year’s 

worth of research on campus 
affordability, how to make things 
more accessible, what you can do 
to advocate for housing resources,” 
Jawad said. “We finally were able 
to put that into a guide called the 
Campus Affordability Guide.”

According to Jawad, the new 

housing guide, which just finished 
the editing process, has a tentative 
release date during the month of 
January.

Controversial Speakers
In addition to taking action 

on 
initiatives 
and 
platforms 

eMerge 
campaigned 
on, 
the 

representatives have also worked 
to 
find 
a 
balance 
between 

elaborating on established ideas 
and addressing sudden issues 
that have come up throughout the 
semester.

The presence of controversial 

speakers on campus is one that 
Sarkar and Jawad have taken 
a stance against and that has 
reflected the advocacy portion of 
their original campaign. In its first 
statement 
condemning 
author 

Charles Murray on campus, CSG 
made the distinction between the 
speaker’s right to free speech and 
students’ right to free speech in 
opposing speakers like Murray.

“There is a massive and crucial 

difference 
between 
opening 

our minds in order to consider 
new and different ideas, and 
allowing 
pseudo-academics 
to 

portray racism as ‘new ideas,’” the 
statement reads.

As questions and anxieties 

continue 
to 
arise 
about 
the 

specifics of a potential speech on 
campus by white supremacist and 
neo-Nazi Richard Spencer, CSG 
has taken an active stand against 
the possibility of Spencer coming 
to the University.

At a Board of Regents’s meeting 

in 
early 
December, 
Sarkar 

presented a petition, which had 
already received 5,000 signatures 
in two days from students, to 
stop Spencer from speaking on 
campus.

Reflecting on the meeting, 

Sarkar explained that while she 
believes the administration seeks 
to continue prioritizing student 
safety, tensions increase when 
constant questions continue to 
surround the issue.

“I believe that there are people 

who have our best interests in 
mind and heart when they are in 
these decision-making positions,” 
she said. “This issue arises when 
there isn’t transparency around 
how they approach doing that.”

Jawad 
echoed 
similar 

sentiments, highlighting that the 
work they have done this past 
semester in condemning speakers 
such as Spencer and Murray also 
includes ensuring CSG continues 
to support students who feel 
unsafe from or fearful of a 
potential Spencer visit.

“We really want to be a resource 

for students, making sure that 
if people need something, if he 
(Spencer) was to come or even if 
he wasn’t, because a lot of people 
are experiencing just a lot of 
anxiety with the thought of the 
event coming,” she said. “We’ve 
really just tried to make sure that 
we can be a resource to students in 
this time.”

Divestment
Reflecting on the #UMDivest 

movement, Sarkar and Jawad 
highlighted 
the 
eight-hour 

meeting in which the resolution 
passed, 
emphasizing 
students’ 

commitment to advocating for 

what they so passionately believe 
in.

“People felt so passionate about 

this issue, no matter where they 
fell on it ideologically, that they 
spent eight hours in the (Modern 
Languages Building) advocating 
for what they believed in,” Sarkar 
said. “That’s the sort of organizing 
and Michigan spirit of activism 
that I think keeps me motivated in 
what I do.”

Jawad, who addressed the 

assembly personally as a student 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
resolution, 

also reflected on this sense of 
engagement and discussion that 
surrounded the meeting.

“The thing that I took the most 

out of it was the ability to create a 
space where people can have those 
long discussions and being willing 
to be there and being so passionate 
that they want to be there for that 
long to talk about the things that 
they care about,” Jawad said.

At the CSG meeting following 

the 
passing 
of 
#UMDivest, 

however, Jawad explained she 
received 
criticism 
for 
taking 

the floor, as one representative 
questioned the power imbalance 
they believed she created.

“Are you all clear that I spoke 

during 
community 
concerns 

as opposed to during executive 
communications to try and share 
my narrative (despite) being an 
executive?” 
Jawad 
responded 

during the meeting. “And though 
I know that it wasn’t a way to 
take away what I am as the vice 
president, it wasn’t my intent to 
abuse my power. Are you aware 
that other (executive) members 
including 
the 
president 
and 

former vice president of student 
body vocally supported a stance 
on the actual politics and not on 
the resolution?”

This 
particular 
meeting 

brought 
debate 
among 
CSG 

members, as the impacts of 
#UMDivest 
were 
discussed. 

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Andrew 

Watkins spoke in opposition to the 
resolution and voiced his concerns 
with specific context of the passed 
resolution.

“This assembly emboldened 

the BDS movement,” Watkins 
said during the meeting. SAFE 
previously stated #UMDivest is 
not associated with the “Boycott, 
Divestment 
and 
Sanctions” 

movement. “They did not say a 
word to denounce the movement, 
and to me, that silence rings 
louder than anything else they 
said,” Watkins said.

In a statement that signified 

her thoughts on the resolution 
released 
the 
Tuesday 
before 

Thanksgiving, Sarkar explained 

the 
changes 
before 
signing, 

including removing the words 
Israel and Israeli and the names 
of specific companies, so as to 
investigate all investments that 
violate Palestinian human rights.

Looking Ahead
In looking forward to the work 

to be done next semester, Sarkar 
and Jawad hope to continue 
building upon their resources and 
community organizing strategies 
in response to conflicts that arise 
rather than forgetting about the 
facilities already available to them 
during moments of intense issues.

“I’ve often observed from this 

position that when we have tense 
moments in our campus climate, 
we sort of put constructive 
counter-programming 
or 

resources to the side to evaluate 
the conflict itself rather than 
evaluating what we have at our 
disposal to counter it,” Sarkar said.

In particular, Sarkar looks 

forward to continuing work on the 
public service pitch competition 
Innovate, which will be run by 
CSG and will emphasize the 
importance of providing positive 
and 
helpful 
programming 
to 

students during times of a difficult 
campus climate.

Jawad anticipates the creation 

of a CSG biweekly or triweekly 
video that will be posted on 
social media to increase student 
awareness of programs available, 
specifically those campaigned on 
last winter.

“Some of our platform points 

had a lot to do with awareness and 
kind of just recognizing resources 
on campus and thinking about 
how we can streamline them 
or make them more visible to 
students,” Jawad explained.

Overall, the assembly looks 

to continue supporting students 
during a time when political 
climate has raised concerns and 
anxiety among many members 
of the University. In continuing 
programming already available 
and expanding upon ways to 
provide students with resources 
advocating for safety, student voice 
and constructive conversation, 
Sarkar and Jawad anticipate the 
work and dedication to be put into 
the coming semester.

“Because the University is 

so decentralized it can be very 
difficult to identify where you go 
to get something, to get a resource, 
to 
talk 
to 
somebody 
about 

something,” Sarkar said. “It’s 
the point of student government 
to be a liaison between students 
and 
decision 
makers 
and 
 

resources, so I would hope that 
we can continue doing that next 
semester.”

a Jewish person, he has a role 
to play in speaking against 
Zionism.

“I spoke at the divestment

it’s important as a Jewish 
person to … talk about how 
there’s this Zionist impetus to 
speak for Jewish people,” he 
said.

The

adding he believes the views 
of Jewish students on campus 
differ from the views of people 
who are pro-Israel.

“I don’t even think it’s 

accurate to say that they (the 
University of Michigan Hillel) 
speak for the majority of Jews 
because 
statistically, 
most 

Jews, at least on campus, are 
in the middle and apathetic 
to this issue and they sort 
of present it as any attack 
on the state of Israel is an 
attack on Judaism itself and 
I try to rebuff that at any 
opportunity.”

space. I want to be by myself, I 
want to process this.’ Sometimes 
a sense of wellbeing and safety 
doesn’t come just from a clinical 
practitioner. Sometimes it comes 
from who you know and who 
you feel comfortable with — and 
making sure that we’re mindful 
of all of those kinds of options for 
students. Some folks will choose 
to go home, or choose to do what 
they would normally do with their 
friends. So depending on how 
you respond, what makes you feel 
safe when you’re in a dangerous 
situation is what we want to make 
sure that we provide a lot of options.

TMD: One of the things 

Richard Spencer’s team said, in 
pushing the University for an 
earlier decision date, was that they 
need time to make arrangements 
to bring numerous people to 
campus. How big of a concern is 
that for the University and are 
they going to push back on that?

Harper: I don’t know if the 

University would push back about 
who he brings or invites as much 
as taking into consideration what’s 
the safety implications of that. 
The other thing that I would offer 
around this idea of psychological 
safety and emotional safety, where 
we want to be really, really careful, 
is — and I think it’s a delicate 
path we walk — I don’t want my 
whereabouts restricted because 
somebody looks at me and decides 
I’m unsafe. Or they look at my 
grandson, who’s tall and lanky, and 
decide he’s unsafe. So for me, as 
an African American, this idea of 
not feeling safe, this idea of ‘I only 
want to walk down the street when 
I see certain people, I don’t want to 
get in an elevator with other’ — all 
this idea of ‘I feel psychologically 
unsafe’ really creates a ripe area 
for discrimination. This is what I 
would offer: I think students are 

saying that that’s the argument 
we’re using. I would frame it 
this way: that’s the caution we’re 
taking. That’s what we’re trying 
to weigh. I’m not saying that that, 
in and of itself, is enough, but I am 
saying we should consider that. We 
should fold that into our thinking.

TMD: There seems to be, in 

all these protests and debates 
around 
Spencers 
appearance, 

a 
pretty 
clear 
disconnect 

between the students who are 
protesting and the administrators 
responding to those protests, in 
that administrators feel they’re 
listening to students’ concerns 
and students feel they’re still not 
doing enough to address those 
concerns. Why do you think that’s 
happening?

Harper: Two things happen: 

We behave internally, like we can 
have an internal conversation 
that nobody else is listening to. 
So, if Richard Spencer and those 
who follow him are dangerous 
— and I actually believe they are, 
and intend to do harm — why 
would I publicize where, when, 
how? Because if your intent is to 
do harm, the more I tell you, and 
the earlier I tell you increases 
the likelihood that you could 
create more harm. So I think the 
disconnect comes because what’s 
reassuring to students isn’t just 
contained in that population. 
We’re trying to have a kind of 
private conversation about how 
we secure our community in a 
public forum. And students are 
saying, ‘Tell us everything.’ Well, 
the ‘us’ is much larger than the 
student body or the community 
harmed. I think that there is an 
expectation from students of 
administrative behavior that, on 
its surface, appears pretty easy, 
until you add a layer of complexity. 
There are times when everything 
a community wants to know, 
feels like it’s entitled to know, is 
simply not appropriate to share. 
And that’s when trust becomes 

important, and giving people the 
benefit of the doubt. And I think 
we’re sort of low on that right now.

TMD: What I hear students 

say is that they’re not able to self-
determine their safety.

Harper: Sure they are. Sure. 

You can go, or not go. If your own 
sense is ‘I am unsafe, Royster.’ I 
don’t want to hear what this guy 
has to say, I am not going. There 
is nothing he’s going to say. I do 
get to self-determine, I do have a 
choice, I do have agency. I don’t 
have a choice over what other 
people do, but I do have a choice 
over what I do, and the decisions I 
make. I always have a choice, and 
I’m not giving that up to Richard 
Spencer, I’m not giving that up to 
the University of Michigan, and 
I don’t need everybody to agree 
with me to use my sense of agency. 
So I will not concede that. I cannot 
say that there is some person, 
or someone external to me, that 
takes away my agency. No. And I 
certainly won’t concede that to 
Richard Spencer.

TMD: In your tenure as vice 

president, and more specifically 
this past semester and year, how 
have you seen these issues facing 
marginalized students change, 
and how has the relationship of 
marginalized students with the 
administration changed?

Harper: I do think it’s in a 

national context. The national 
divisiveness has come on campus 
also. Much more difficult to not 
find common ground, but to hear 
each other’s common ground. It’s 
not that we don’t have it, but the 
national narrative is extremes. Us 
and they, rather than a we. And 
Richard Spencer is coming here to 
harm ‘we’ — us. Think about who 
he targets — I’m not sure who he 
doesn’t target, other than a very 
small portion of the population 
which looks exactly like him. So 
that we would then be in conflict, 
rather than in community around 
this, that would be a change. 

We’ve got folks in Puerto Rico, 
months 
later, 
without 
water. 

And the old us would’ve been 
busy doing that work. The new 
us — we’re fighting about, on the 
scale, way less important things. 
We’ve somehow managed to get 
ourselves to where every issue 
is of the same importance. And 
it’s not. I don’t want to downplay 
Richard Spencer — but really? 
At best, he’s going to come, if 
he’s allowed to come, talk for an 
hour, and go somewhere else and 
say the same thing. At best. But 
a travel ban? A tax cut that hurts 
education and graduate students? 
A tax cut that hurts the poor? If 
given a choice, that’s probably not 
where I would spend my time and 
energy. If given a choice.

TMD: As you saw at the 

Regents’ meeting, the calls for a 
ME/NA checkbox on University 
documents and collection data 
is growing, and a number of 
supporters were at the meeting. 
Do you support the addition of a 
ME/NA checkbox?

Harper: Again, here’s another 

one where work is being done. I 
don’t think there’s anything wrong 
with the community saying, ‘I 

want to be identified, and I want 
to be able to check a box.’ It doesn’t 
matter, in the community I’m in, 
whether I check it or not. And I 
think having the numbers to make 
sure the resources are there, and 
that we can help students, I get that 
and support that. I think where I 
struggle personally is when that’s 
an affirmation, when that’s a way 
to say, ‘I’m being seen.’ But I don’t 
have to understand it to be able to 
respond to it. So this idea of making 
sure that we know the numbers, 
and that students are getting the 
support that they need, absolutely. 
And the strategy students want to 
use for that is a box. I guess that’s 
the right strategy. There are other 
students who say: ‘I don’t want to 
be targeted that way. Leave me 
alone.’ There are students who 
don’t want it. There are students 
who do.

TMD: Do you think we’ll see a 

resolution to this debate around 
the box in the near future?

Harper: Boy, I hope so, as long 

as we’ve been working on it. And 
trying to figure out, how do we 
get at what’s being asked, separate 
from how it’s being asked.

I 
 

recently saw “Battle of 
the Sexes,” a movie about 
tennis star Billie Jean King 

beating self-proclaimed “male 
chauvinist 
pig” 

Bobby Riggs in 1973.

I 
didn’t 
think 

the movie was very 
good, 
but 
that’s 

not what I want to 
talk about. I want, 
instead, to point out 
that the film speaks 
specifically to the 
#MeToo 
campaign 

and 
the 
slew 
of 

disgusting men who 
have been exposed as such in 
the past several weeks. 

Riggs, who in an effort to 

drum up publicity for the match 
publicly made a series of overtly 
misogynistic statements about 
male 
superiority, 
functions 

as a stand-in for all of those 
men who have been defamed. 
Except he never tried to hide 
his sexism; there was never any 
investigation necessary. It was 
baldly out in the open.

Riggs — played by Steve 

Carell, who, when on camera, 
immediately evokes Michael 
Scott and the 40-year-old virgin 
such that I always am smirking 
as I watch him — is portrayed 
as a complete nut, stuffing his 
gullet with a vitamin regimen, 
alienating himself from his 
family because of his addiction 
to 
gambling, 
hijacking 
a 

Gamblers Anonymous meeting 
by offering to play blackjack, 
and, 
as 
mentioned 
above, 

publicly defaming King and 
all women. And, finally, he is 
soundly dominated by King in 
the match of his dreams, which 
he orchestrated.

Maybe 
one 
reason 
the 

movie’s power faltered was the 
film’s ostensibly neutral take 
on Riggs’s misogyny. The film 
shrugs off Riggs’s comments, 
at best as an effort to drum up 
publicity for the tennis match, 
or, at worst, as a product of 
Riggs simply being his old, wily 
self — “boys will be boys.”

Furthermore, despite the fact 

that Riggs does lose in the end, I 
left the movie theater knowing 
instead that Riggs — the figure 
of the overtly hateful man — 
wins. I see Riggs in all the men 
yet to be caught in response 
to 
the 
public 
testimonies 

of 
victims, 
alongside 
the 

#MeToo campaign. I see Riggs 
in Richard Spencer, a white 

supremacist 
political 
leader 

who might be allowed to come 
to our campus. I see Riggs in 
Roy Moore, accused of sexual 

misconduct 
and 

rape 
by 
currently 

eight 
women 
— 

many of whom were 
girls at the time of 
these allegations — 
whom our president 
has 
just 
endorsed 

in 
his 
senatorial 

election. I see Riggs, 
furthermore, in our 
president himself.

We 
might 
take 

the film’s title as a descriptor 
for our contemporary moment. 
This is a battle of gendered 
power dynamics, where men 
use women as coercible objects 
meant to please their perverse, 
selfish desires. Until we have 
collectively 
rooted 
out 
the 

dynamics that allow for these 
assaults to take place, we 
have not done enough — the 
Trumps, Moores and Riggses 
of the world continue to win 
the battle of the sexes. They 
maintain 
their 
positions 

of power, they continue to 
capture mainstream cultural 
attention, despite their publicly 
understood 
and 
despicable 

words and actions.

One potential problem with 

movies like this one, which 
fictionalizes 
a 
watershed 

historical event of social and 
political significance, is that 
they risk restricting the event 
and its implications to the past. 
We look at the past from our 
present squishy movie theater 
chair, 
eating 
popcorn 
and 

pointing backward — look at 
how things were. And look at 
how different they are now.

This 
dehistoricization 

restricts the opportunity for 
an honest engagement with 
our own time, in terms of 
the problems brought forth 
by the films themselves. It 
allows for complacency and 
acceptance for the injustices of 
our own time, for present-day 
audiences to fall prey to the 
illusion that human history is 
naturally, intrinsically a story 
of gradual, consistent increases 
in egalitarianism and equality. 
That could never happen today.

The movie itself does not 

engage in this amnesiac logic, 
nor does the film outwardly 
resist it. This may have been 
another reason it fell a bit flat: 

It seemed not to engage larger 
conversations beyond this one 
exhibition tennis match.

The work of using this film 

for 
contemporary 
cultural 

purposes, then, falls on its 
audience. I think we ought 
to understand “Battle of the 
Sexes” as an opportunity to 
understand how far we haven’t 
come. 
To 
understand 
the 

ways in which men like Bobby 
Riggs have not lost that battle, 
as the film’s dramatic final 
scene would have its audiences 
believe. 
And 
instead, 
we 

ought to interrogate the ways 
in which Riggs and his kind 
have remained staples of our 
culture, navigating their ways 
to positions of exponentially 
more 
power 
and 
prestige 

than Riggs, whose greatest 
accomplishments came as a 
tennis champion, long before 
the sport had accumulated the 
international following it has 
today.

This portrayal of overtly 

misogynistic 
public 
figures 

— as wily, unstable outcasts 
without any social capital, 
having 
derailed 
themselves 

with their prejudice — risks 
engaging the cultural amnesia 
I outlined above. It allows us 
to write off Riggs as a crazed 
figure of the past who has 
since disappeared, a name 
most people would not even 
recognize today. It allows us 
to dismiss this problem as one 
of the past, a product of our 
ongoing, 
consistent 
march 

toward a “more perfect union,” 
to perpetuate a notion of 
history that necessarily ends 
in some realized promised 
land, such that we equate the 
past and all the events that 
compose it with a less civilized 
and just time than the one we 
currently occupy.

Nobody 
would 
dismiss 

Donald Trump, Roy Moore, 
Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K., 
Al Franken, Matt Lauer and 
the rest as aberrations, last 
remnants of a system long 
faded. Which means Bobby 
Riggs still exists today, with 
the vital reinforcements of 
maximal fame and power.

The battle of the sexes, then, is 

ongoing. We must remember this.

W

hat does it mean to be 
a good person? In a 
world full of difficult 

choices, I find myself grappling 
with this question daily. Are 
only those people who are truly 
good, whose bravery and strict 
moral codes have changed the 
world, allowed to be called good 
people? And is there a difference 
between small acts of kindness 
and big ones? The people who 
donate to charity, who are polite 
to strangers, who are aware of 
how bad the world is but aren’t 
able to or inclined to make any 
drastic changes, can they still be 
considered good people?

Having grown up in a religious 

household, I was brought up 
aware of the existence of evil. Evil, 
as I was taught by my pastor and 
my vacation Bible school classes, 
was personified by the presence 
of a devil, the cause of all things 
bad in this world. I imagined the 
devil as the stereotypical horned, 
red man, carrying a trident and 
having a devious look on his face.

Though I didn’t realize it at 

the time, I had convinced myself 
that evil could be spotted as a 
silly-looking man wearing a cape 
and that anyone who didn’t fit my 
own, narrow interpretation of evil 
could be trusted, or at least wasn’t 
evil. As I grew up, my image of evil 
grew to include more caricatures 
— the creepy pedophile, the 
violent racist, to name a few — but 
my understanding of what evil is 
did not.

A few things in my life made 

me question my understanding 
of evil. One was a World War 
II and Holocaust class I took 
in high school, where I learned 
how the concept of “business as 
usual” was used to normalize 
the violence against Jews and 
other 
minorities 
in 
Europe. 

Up until then, my concept of 
evil had always been limited to 
individuals — Hitler was evil, 
Mussolini was evil; it was hard 
for me to comprehend that an 
entire population had somehow 
been evil or had been complicit in 
evil. My straightforward view on 
evil was being challenged, and I 
was struggling against it. I began 
to question what it meant to be a 
good person.

Two events have occurred 

recently that I feel represent our 
society’s inability to view evil in 
a nuanced way. The first has been 
the reaction to what has been 
dubbed the “Weinstein Effect,” 
i.e., the public downfall of various 
men accused of serial sexual 
harassment. After the downfall of 
her friend Louis C.K., comedian 
Sarah Silverman delivered a 
monologue on her show “I Love 
You, America” where she asked, 
“Can you love someone who did 
bad things?”

Second, The New York Times 

published a profile on a Nazi 
sympathizer titled “A Voice of 
Hate in America’s Heartland,” 
which was widely derided for 
exhibiting sympathy for the said 
Nazi. These two instances, though 
widely different, I believe exhibit 
a common theme in our morality: 
our inability to normalize evil and 
thus recognize evil that doesn’t fit 
our standards or caricatures.

Sarah 
Silverman, 
albeit 

unintentionally, 
addressed 
a 

topic often brought up when a 
famous or well-respected man 
is accused of sexual assault: that 
this man had a good reputation, 
was a friend to many and because 
of this, many cannot believe 
that he committed such a crime. 
Silverman handled this issue in 
the best possible way she could 
— she addressed her emotions 
without denying the experiences 
of the survivors. Oftentimes, it is 
hard for friends and loved ones to 
imagine that someone they care 
about has hurt others. Men who 
were kind, who were feminists, 
who were kind to their daughters 
couldn’t possibly be a part of the 
problem, could they?

Likewise, the author of The 

New York Times article, Richard 
Fausset, seemed to be surprised 
that Nazi sympathizers are, 
in fact, human. He seemed to 
express confusion that not every 
one of their actions revolves 
around terrorizing people of 
color, that they are capable 
of being polite, that they get 
married, that they can cook 
pasta, that they have friends. 
He ended the article with no 
deep conclusions, instead simply 
describing a scene where his 

subject and his subject’s then-
fiancé had a relaxing evening, 
stating 
“they 
spoke 
about 

their future — about moving 
to a bigger place, about their 
honeymoon, about having kids.” 
All these things may be true, but 
what do we risk by humanizing 
a Nazi-sympathizer? Someone 
who expresses respect for Hitler, 
who believes that races should 
be kept separate?

This brings me back to my 

original question: What does 
it mean to be a good person? 
Can a sexual predator or a 
Nazi-sympathizer be a good 
person? I’m going to be honest: 
Considering I don’t even know 
what it means to be a good person, 
these questions are beyond me. 
Any attempt on my end to answer 
them will be disappointing. 

Instead, I propose we think 

about this concept in an entirely 
different way and stop trying 
to grapple with the cognitive 
dissonance 
of 
realizing 
that 

someone who does something 
that is objectively wrong can 
also be capable of love and 
kindness. I would argue that 
considerate people sometimes 
do evil things and participate in 
evil movements. Their actions 
are what we describe as evil, 
even if these individuals don’t fit 
our storybook, devil-with-horns 
definition of evil.

In the end, our society has 

built up moral codes for a reason; 
we 
have 
determined 
racism 

is bad, sympathizing with the 
leader of a genocide movement is 
immoral, sexual assault is wrong. 
I believe sometimes it is hard for 
us to grasp just how complicated 
fellow human beings can be, but I 
propose we stop assuming people 
who appear to be nice and kind 
aren’t capable of terrible things.

Because, 
overall, 
being 
a 

good person doesn’t really mean 
anything. It’s only a phrase 
used by individuals, and what 
makes a good person can vary 
widely from person to person. It 
couldn’t, and it shouldn’t, hold 
up any type of evidence in a 
public court of opinion.

 How to spot a bad person

I 

want to set aside for a 
moment the question of 
race-based 
affirmative 

action. There are legitimate 
arguments for both sides of that 
debate, and though I do have my 
own opinion, it need not enter 
this discussion of a second, more 
pernicious form of affirmative 
action: legacy preference. 

My division of affirmative 

action into two halves — race 
and class — is somewhat self-
serving, I have to admit. Racial 
affirmative action is an intricate 
policy problem in which any good 
solutions bring uncomfortable 
financial concerns. On the other 
hand, legacy preference might 
be resolvable in an afternoon. 
It seems like all universities 
would have to do is publicly 
announce they will no longer be 
preferencing legacies.

I often hear the argument 

that 
legacy 
preference 
is 
a 

way of rewarding alumni and 
encouraging 
donations. 
My 

response has always been that 
meritocracy is not a take-what-
you-will proposition; race and 
legacy are both inheritances and 
are thus distributed in an entirely 
unmeritocratic 
way. 
Legacy 

admits are also more likely to 
have higher parental incomes — 
at Duke University, for example, 
the household income of legacy 
students is, on average, $240,000 
a year — which brings with it a 
host of benefits in K-12 education 
and nutrition. When seeking 
meritocratic competition, there 
are only so many head starts one 
can get before the whole event 
begins to look comically unjust.

The primary driver of debate 

over racial affirmative action is 
the question of what side makes 
the process most “fair,” with fair 
meaning that the most deserving 
students get spots at universities. 
I find it hard to believe that legacy 
status enters this equation at all. 

What academic ability does it 
demonstrate? 
What 
personal 

character does it showcase? What 
historical barrier has it overcome? 
Legacy status does not fit within a 
framework for college admissions 
that prioritizes students who 
deserve the spots on the basis of 
their own qualities.

One might respond that elite 

schools — which are the focus of 
most classic affirmative action 
debates — are not moral actors 
and don’t need to uphold some 
cultural goal of meritocracy. 
They don’t seek to do the most 
good for the most people, they 
seek to reward their customers. 
Applicants whose parents are 
perceived by the university as 
more likely to donate, then, 
can 
actually 
deserve 
sports 

the most. If this is the case, 
though, universities cannot act 
as fronts for opportunity, and 
their customers — that’s us, at 
the University of Michigan — 
cannot pretend that our place is 
earned any more than a product 
is “earned” when one pays for it.

The 
University 
does 
not 

indicate the extent to which 
legacy 
preference 
affects 

consideration 
of 
student 

applications, only that it does play 
a role. Other universities, though 
— even those who have made 
public strides toward diversity — 
give a rather dismal indication of 
what the situation might be like 
here. I haven’t found any publicly 
available data on exactly how 
much legacy affects applicants 
to the University, however, so it’s 
impossible to say with certainty.

It’s 
important 
that 
legacy 

preference 
receives 
proper 

consideration in larger dialogues 
about class here at the University. 
It’s often discussed as just a minor 
policy with minimal impact — one 
aspect of a holistic application! 
— which obscures the actual 
consequences of the policy.

At Princeton University, for 

example, an article written in 2010 
seemed to make the correlation 
between legacy status and an 
applicant’s chance of admission 
at the school from about 9 percent 
to over 40 percent. Further 
research indicates that the full 
effect of legacy status fluctuates 
depending on one’s SAT scores — 
when in the 1250-1290 range, for 
example, legacy provides a 13.6 
percent boost; when in the 1400-
1440 range, it rises to more than 
19.9 percent. 

There 
are 
institutions 

that 
have 
run 
admissions 

experiments 
which 
do 
not 

include legacy, thankfully. MIT 
and Caltech, for example, have 
ended legacy preference, and 
though reputation is partially 
up for subjective evaluation, 
I’m not aware of any status 
drop for either of these schools 
or their students.

In 
the 
end, 
either 
elite 

universities are pure businesses, 
and can act in their self-
defined best interests, or they 
are something different, and 
should thus be compelled to 
uphold a cultural expectation of 
meritocracy. We cannot have it 
both ways, though. If the most 
capable students should attend 
the best schools, then college 
applicants cannot be arbitrarily 
advantaged by class any more 
than they can by race.

Legacy preference is a form 

of affirmative action rooted in 
class that extends privilege to the 
already privileged. Its existence 
both here at the University and 
elsewhere 
directly 
impedes 

efforts to “provide an uncommon 
education for the common man,” 
and should be ended immediately.

Tuesday, December 12, 2017 — 5

Since the premiere of “Broad 

City” in 2014, the careers of Ilana 
Glazer (“Rough Night”) and Abbi 
Jacobson (“Portlandia”) have taken 
off. Jacobson has been able to work 
with the Museum of Modern Art in 
New York to create a podcast about 
fine art. Glazer has been getting 
more work in other films and 
television series. Life has changed 
since the duo uploaded the first 
YouTube short in 2011. Glazer and 
Jacobson obviously no longer have 
to worry about the same financial 
concerns which continue to plague 
the on-screen characters — yet the 
show never forgets the characters’ 
humble beginnings. In the “Broad 
City” universe, friendship, not 
money, is the most powerful tool 
for getting anything done.

The finale of season four, 

“Friendiversary,” 
finds 
the 

heroines reflecting on the past 
few years of friendship in a way 
that is uncharacteristic for a show 
like “Broad City.” Season four 
consisted of many moments that 
looked inward: Ilana’s battle with 
depression, Abbi’s struggles against 
poverty and unemployment and 
life under Trump (whose name is 
censored). The tonal shift matches 
the seasonal shift in the universe of 
“Broad City.” It’s finally winter.

For all its millennial styles 

and sensibilities, “Broad City” 
approaches 
the 
season 
in 
a 

strikingly classic way. Both Abbi 
and Ilana are forced to face 
some unpleasant realities about 
the world and endure some 
hardship. Both women fail, in 
some respect, to live up to a set 
of standards and have to admit 
their shortcomings. Ilana gets a 
particularly rich character arc 
this season while she works under 
Marcel (RuPaul, “RuPaul’s Drag 
Race”) at his restaurant, Sushi 
Mambeaux. After a troubling shift, 

she confesses that her depression 
interferes with her ability to give 
it her all. Marcel forgives her and 
keeps her on staff, which sends the 
message that Ilana is important 
and valid while she suffers with 
depression.

While 
the 
season 
finale 

tackles a topic of less weight, the 
episode sends the same message. 
Abbi, upon waking, finds a giant 
cardboard standup of Ilana’s head 
and a clue that leads to a scavenger 
hunt. It ends at a cheap barbeque 
place, where the pair devours a 
fat tray of chicken fingers and 

slushie cocktails. However, it’s not 
all sunny and celebratory. Ilana 
reveals that the purpose of the 
scavenger hunt is to celebrate their 
Friendiversary, which Abbi has 
completely forgotten. Abbi’s poor 
attempts to assemble an equally 
thoughtful and elaborate gift end 
up leading the duo to the top of the 
Empire State Building on a rainy 
night. Long story short, Abbi and 
Ilana end up pursuing a man who 
they think threw a sex doll off of 
the balcony.

After they confront the man, 

which almost leads to jail time for 
Abbi and Ilana, Abbi divulges that 
she forgot their Friendiversary. 
Ilana quickly replies that she 
knew, with no tinge of injury 
or malice in her voice. While 
Ilana isn’t a vengeful character, 
it wouldn’t be out of her range to 
feel neglected or forgotten. It’s 
a beautiful moment where the 
audience realizes how in-tune and 
intimate the characters are with 
each other. Abbi’s unwillingness 
to mellow Ilana out is matched by 
Ilana’s patience and eagerness to 
follow Abbi’s ideas. As the camera 
pans to a section of sidewalk where 
“Ilana + Abbi 2011” is etched into 
the concrete, the audience gets the 
sense of the permanence of their 
friendship. In times of turmoil, the 
most valuable resources that we 
have are our friends. “Broad City” 
never forgets this. 

COMEDY CENTRAL

‘Broad’ exhaults friends

JACK BRANDON

Daily Arts Writer

Patti Smith’s ‘Horses’ is 
indelible after 42 years

One of the most pivotal albums 

in rock history, Horses by Patti 
Smith, will have circled around 
the sun 42 times tomorrow.

It has influenced countless 

magicians and artists alike and has 
left lasting impressions on music 
admirers of all tastes. For me, 
Horses has influenced the way I 
hear music, the way I identify with 
art and the way I choose to release 
myself into the world.

I’ve only had the chance to 

spend four short years of my life 
with the album, but its emotional 
pull has made every listen count. 
Sixteen-year-old me was busy 
with the abrasive sounds of 
Powerslave by Iron Maiden, along 
with other variants of metal and 
their opposites, namely Pavement.

But nothing hit me the way 

Horses did with its poetic lyrics 
and 
igniting 
instrumentals. 

Smith’s voice and her ability to 
make everything personal made 
my entire body melt, leaving my 
nakedness to stand on its own for 
the first time in my life.

The experience started in the 

key of E with an introductory 
rendition 
of 
Van 
Morrison’s 

“Gloria.” Smith’s honey voice 
starts to speak with backing 
instrumentals that explode into 
waves of sexuality. With each 
note, Smith’s voice echoed through 
my ears and shook my lungs with 
an unapologetic strength I never 
knew existed, and this feeling 
persisted for the entirety of the 
album.

Listening to the whole record 

can be an emotionally taxing 
experience, 
as 
Smith 
pushes 

through uneasy emotions that 
come with the exploration in 
gender and sexuality including 
the neglect, the confusion and 
the internal struggle of self-
acceptance. And she did this all 
with an underlying influence of 
the sexual liberation movement 
during the ’60s and the people 
who felt rejected by it.

Smith moves from telling the 

world about a lesbian suicide in 
“Redondo Beach” to speaking 
about a homosexual rape in 
“Land,” all with a strong tone that 
forces a listener to hear her out, to 
be aware of the grotesque side of 
society.

She sings about death, despair 

and dehumanization. Her voice 
damns the world and lets everyone 
know that she’s angry. She’s 

angry about the disgusting acts in 
humanity. She’s angry about war, 
about liberation movements that 
fought only for a white and straight 
kind of equality, and she wants the 
world to know that she has become 
strong enough to begin fighting for 
those who were left behind.

Horses has stamped a trace of 

ethereal emotion into the Earth 
that will never be lost. It will be 
heard in every song influenced by 
its authenticity, including songs 
by Siouxsie and the Banshees, 
The Smiths, R.E.M and bands that 
can’t even decide on their name 
yet.

It has become such a timely 

record regarding the inequalities 
our world is ridden with today, 
and will continue to be a timeless 
work of art that strums against 
our deepest emotions and calls 
attention to the world’s deepest 
failures.

For 
me, 
 
Horses 
became 

a 
spiritual 
experience 
of 

dissociation. It felt like Smith’s 
evocative 
lyrics 
carried 
me 

to Jupiter, where I felt the 
gravitational pull of 16 moons 
hold me in place. It was extremely 
heavy, and I’d give anything to 
anyone if I could listen to Horses 
for the first time again.

Rumor has it that Queen 

Elizabeth once asked William 
Shakespeare to write a play in 
which her favorite character of Sir 
John Falstaff (featured in “Henry 
IV”) falls in love. Shakespeare 
delivered, but it was far from what 
the Queen expected.

“Falstaff in ‘Merry Wives’ is 

in love alright, but mainly with 
himself and money,” said director, 
John Neville-Andrews.

Humor, revenge, girl power and 

a ritualistic fairy dance: The play 
has all the elements to captivate 
the audience and leave them 
laughing to the end. Put on by the 
University of Michigan’s School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance at the 
Power Center this past weekend, 
“The Merry Wives of Windsor” is 
one of Shakespeare’s lesser-known 
works, and his only farce — a play 
of complete buffoonery.

The 
plot 
centers 
on 
two 

married women, Mistress Paige 
and Mistress Ford, who receive 
identical love letters from the 
same guy, Sir John Falstaff. 
Unfortunately for Falstaff, these 
women are best friends, realize his 
fraudulence and make plans for 
revenge. 

Retribution 
is 
a 
beautiful 

thing. In a time where women 
had little power, Paige and Ford 
seem to create their own rules for 
humiliating Falstaff time and time 
again. They pretend to respond 
to his advances but have no real 
intention of pursuing the fat, 
ageing man as a suitor.

The play resembles your classic 

girls-get-revenge-on-the-guy 
movie. In “John Tucker Must 
Die,” one guy dated several girls 
simultaneously; when the girls find 
out, they decide to seek vengeance. 
They 
scheme 
embarrassing 

scenarios for Tucker, like tricking 
him into putting on women’s 
underwear. Similarly, Falstaff is 
forced to put on women’s attire 
at one point. While less regarded 
among critics, “The Merry Wives 
of Windsor” has certainly left an 

impression upon the cinematic 
world since many similar plotlines 
have manifested themselves into 
the movies of today.

The 
play 
is 
“considered 

intellectually slight, having little or 
no depth to the characters— just a 
bunch of country bumpkins posing 
as middle class,” Neville-Andrews 
said. But he disagrees with the 
critics. 
“I 
think 
Shakespeare 

has given us a play of true comic 
depth; he bestowed upon us 
a gallimaufry of rich, vibrant 
characters who possess individual 
and hilarious personalities and 
who energetically demonstrate a 
lust for life.”

The student actors took the 

centuries-old script and paired it 
with modern tones, inflections and 
body language, making it easier 
for 
a 
contemporary 
audience 

to understand and enjoy. One 
amusing line, “the woman has 
good gifts,” would have gone 
unnoticed if it weren’t for the 
actor’s emphasis towards his chest 
area, 
indicating 
Shakespeare’s 

subtle innuendo.

Amidst the chaos of the main 

plot and side plots, the underrated 
character Simple, played by Wyatt 
Stromer, really stands out. His hair 
looked like a mop, always lopsided, 
sticking up and about oddly. The 
plot would be advancing, yet his 
character would remain in the 
corner, eating a piece of bread in 
the most idiotic way possible. This 
is the type of character that either 
annoys the audience or steals 
the show. In this case, everytime 
Simple was on stage, all eyes 
watched his awkward walking, 
cringe-worthy conversation skills 

and odd mannerisms that so 
sharply contrasted the rest of the 
characters.

Yes, Shakespearean plays are 

long winded, usually stretching at 
least 3 hours. It’s easy for the mind 
to drift as the brain grows weary 
of trying to decipher every line 
one doesn’t quite understand. It’s 
the paradox of all Shakespearean 
works. On one hand, you admire 
the culture and value of such pieces 
of literature, but on the other hand, 
you would rather just watch an 
undemanding Netflix show.

Shakespeare is not for everyone. 

It is a labor to understand. The 
culture in which it is written 
is so unlike the present. It was 
likely that many jokes flew right 
over the head of the audience, 
simply because most people lack 
knowledge regarding the early 
1600s. One misses out on the key 
elements — not because it was 
poorly produced — but because it 
can be so challenging to watch.

A 
live 
orchestra 
would 

have improved the flow of the 
performance, as some scenes felt 
unnaturally quiet. Silence can be 
powerful, but it can also make time 
go by slowly and monotonously. 
Since the play is already like 
listening to a different language, 
sluggish scenes can kill the whole 
affair. 

Yet, 
the 
audience 
always 

seemed to return to a state of 
laughter at whatever foolish act 
had occurred, and they became 
engrossed in the odd plot all over 
again. It is impossible not to root 
for the women as they take down 
the egotistical Falstaff and watch 
them become heroes of the story.

A Shakespeare play has never 

been quite so enjoyable as the 
relatively unknown “The Merry 
Wives of Windsor.” Master of 
drama and tragedy, Shakespeare 
can also execute timeless humor. 
Seeing women hold power over 
the men in a classic piece was 
refreshing. 
Experts 
in 
both 

sarcasm and revenge, Mistress 
Paige and Mistress Ford broke 
molds and gave light to the absurd 
world of men.

Shakespeare is 
not for everyone. 

It is a labor to 
understand.

“Broad City”

Comedy Central

Season Four Finale

In 
the 
basement 
of 
the 

Modern 
Languages 
Building, 

a site frequented by students 
and teachers alike, is a recently 
painted 
mural 
consisting 
of 

geometric blue triangles arranged 
in a seemingly abstract, yet 
purposeful way. What remains 
unbeknownst to many, however, 
is that it was done by Live in Color, 
a new club at the University.

As part of an effort to bring 

more bright colors to campus and 
beautify the drab building, Live 
in Color was an idea conceived 
by LSA sophomores Zoe Duncan-
Doroff and Julian Hansen. 

“Julian was discussing how 

MLB halls are so dry and desolate 
… wouldn’t it be great if we went 
in and painted it after hours?” 
Duncan-Doroff said.

The pair joked that breaking 

into the building after hours to do 
the mural would be a great way 
to get suspended, so they went to 
the University to get the funding 
necessary to bring their artistic 
visions to life.

By creating colorful, geometric 

murals that improve the the 
overall environment rather than 
portraying a message, the club 
hopes to bring an atmosphere of 
happiness to university buildings 
that are oftentimes associated 
with negative sentiments and 

stress. As stated in their mission 
statement: 
“There 
is 
much 

evidence implying that color can 
boost happiness, morale and mood 
while 
decreasing 
depression. 

Our mission is to strive for these 
changes through art.”

Duncan-Doroff and Hansen 

face challenges in regards to 
finding available walls to paint, 
but are constantly keeping their 
ears to the ground as they wait 

for new opportunities. Currently, 
their first mural in the Modern 
Languages Building is the only 
completed work. However, the 
club recently received approval 
from the facilities manager of 
the building to do another one 
in the German/Slavic languages 
department 
in 
the 
Modern 

Languages Building. The pair also 
has their eye on the brand new 
Weiser building.

“We have a small design team 

of student artists and a lot of 
interested members. We’re not 
holding regular meetings yet since 
it relies on how many locations 
we have. We have to split up the 
members into many different 
teams,” Hansen said.

As the club continues to 

generate 
interest 
and 
gain 

credibility through their exciting 
project plans, Duncan-Doroff and 
Hansen plan to increase numbers 
by adding more designers and 
painters. Hansen elaborates on 
the expansion plans by noting 
that they hope to have their 
first big recruiting push during 
Winterfest, which would then be 
followed by regular meetings. 

What makes Live in Color so 

special is that they aim to attract 
all University students with an 
interest in painting and campus 
beautification, rather than just 
dedicated artists with years of 
experience. “One of the pillars 
at Live in Color is that anybody 
can paint [the murals],” Duncan-
Doroff said.

With winter upon us and 

the temperatures dropping, the 
absence of sun and color from 
campus will soon be much more 
apparent. The pops of bright colors 
and designs created by Live in 
Color in university buildings will 
be a welcomed sight, hopefully 
boosting moods as people face the 
inherent stress that comes with 
being a student.

“I consider us now and forever

These words belong to rapper 

Young 
Ville, 
an 
18-year-old 

from 
Philadelphia 
and 
half 

of the underground rap duo, 
the Yellowboyz. He and his 
counterpart, Tee, have united 
around past struggles — including 
stretches of homelessness — to 
develop a passionate drive for 
respect within the music world 
and an energetic sound to match. 
And they record their music right 
in the University’s backyard in 
Ypsilanti.

The story of the Yellowboyz 

begins 
with 
the 
members’ 

humble 
roots. 
When 
asked 

about his origins, Young Ville 
explained that he picked up a 
knack for wordplay at an early 
age, writing stories and poems to 
cope with surrounding familial 
turmoil. Eventually, he decided 
to couple this passion with his 
natural love for music, taking 
inspiration from artists like J. 
Cole, Jay Z, 2Pac, Meek Mill 
and Eminem. This marriage of 
lyricism and skillful influence is 
evident in Young Ville’s verses; 
the flow and attack with which 

he delivers his smooth rhymes 
are ear-perking. It was not until 
he lost some important people, 
about which he didn’t go into 
detail, that he decided to take 
his talents seriously and pursue 
music as a career.

“We’re in this for the long 

haul,” he said.

Tee experienced a similar 

start, and explained to the Daily 
his especially inspirational story 
in detail: From ages 10 to 19, Tee 
and his family were evicted from 
eight different homes due to his 
mother’s drug abuse. After high 
school, he moved in with Young 
Ville only to eventually move out 
and live homelessly, sleeping on 
any floor he could find for two 
months. After moving in with the 
Yellowboyz’s current manager, 
Tee 
established 
a 
positive 

mindset and drive to turn his 
struggles into success, stating, 
“I don’t ever want to live like 

that [again].” Similarly to Young 
Ville, Tee decided to combine his 
influences, namely Denzel Curry, 
with his past and use music as an 
outlet to share and cope with his 
experiences.

With these beginnings, the 

Yellowboyz framed their content 
and sound. Lyrically, the duo 
raps about their struggles with 
lines like: “Can’t take bites so 
we hit licks / My whole life has 
been like this / Making livings 
off them scripts / Cold cuts every 
day we dream / Demons make 
you pay your fee.” Sonically, 
the rappers, with the help of 
a few third-party producers, 
put together undeniably hype 
beats (see: “shit that kills”) that, 
when coupled with Young Ville’s 
impressive flow and Tee’s wholly 
unique and gritty voice, make for 
music that deserves more than 
its meager average of a thousand 
plays on SoundCloud.

This is not underground rap 

like Chance the Rapper before 
Coloring 
Book. 
This 
is 
not 

underground rap like Kendrick 
Lamar before good kid, M.A.A.D. 
city. This is legitimate, little-
known, 
one-of-a-kind, 
local 

underground — The Yellowboyz 
are exemplifying the side of 
music most of us never see or 
hear, and they’re doing it just 10 
miles away.

Michigan Underground: 
Yellow boyz are the future

Ypsilanti duo Young Ville and Tee make music like no one else

When I was in sixth grade, I 

was living in an apartment with 
my mom and younger brother 
in Baton Rouge, LA. I had never 
been anywhere so hot. We drove 
the Penske down from Indiana 
ourselves — by which I mean my 
mother did it herself, while my 
brother and I read books in the 
front seat — and stood baking 
under an August sun for hours 
after we got there, taking turns 
dragging boxes of our belongings 
up a flight of stairs.

I didn’t like Louisiana for most 

of the time we were there. It was 
the longest I’d ever been that 
far away from my dad, and from 
Indiana. I missed watching the 
trees change color with the seasons 
and disappear under layers of 
snow. There were no trees around 
the cluster of apartments where 
we lived; there was a long, straight 
road, some yellow fields on the 
other side of a fence and railroad 
tracks close enough to drown out 
conversations. There were no 
seasons, either. The heat was made 
worse by the fact that my school 
required navy blue uniforms — 
another first for me.

Of course, a lot of my discomfort 

— in fact, probably all of it — was 
your 
typical 
new-kid-at-school 

bullshit. I was new to this at the 
time, so it felt like a huge deal. 
I didn’t have any friends, didn’t 
know anybody, etc. There were 
some changes that I thought 
were weird and interesting — like 
the fact that some of my classes 
were taught in trailers, and that 
the milk in the cafeteria came in 
plastic baggies instead of cartons, 
neither of which had been the case 
at my old school — and some that 
I found downright annoying, like 
the fact that I’d get into trouble if 
I didn’t add “ma’am” or “sir” after 
everything I said. Above all was 
probably just the fact that I was a 
kid, and I missed home.

So the bottom line is, going to 

school those first few months gave 
me kind of a sick feeling. The bus 
came at six, so I’d wake up at 5:20 in 
the pitch black and change into my 
uniform. I’d get into the passenger 
seat of my mom’s black Jeep, and 
she’d drive me to the entrance of 
the apartment complex, where 
we’d sit together and wait for the 
bus to come. It was too early in the 
morning for any real conversation. 
Mostly we just sat, waited and 
watched the sun come up together. 
And we listened to The Beatles.

I’d listened to The Beatles 

before, of course, but mostly 
here and there — they came up 
on shuffle, found their way into 
various mixtapes. But this was 
every day, this was a ritual. My 
mom had the 1 compilation album, 
the one with a red background and 
a patchy yellow number one on it, 
featuring 27 of the band’s number 
one hit singles from 1962 to 1970. 
I don’t remember how it became 
such a pattern; I just remember 
that every day, this was all I felt 
like listening to. More often than 
not, we listened to it from the 
beginning in order, meaning that 
we’d always get through the same 
three or four songs before the bus 
would come and I’d have to leave.

Even now, that’s what I think 

of when I think of “Love Me Do.” 
Even now, every time I hear the 
ending chord of “From Me to 
You,” I’m absolutely certain that 
the drums of “She Loves You” are 
about to kick in, even though it 
takes me a moment to remember 
why.

Music is something that people 

are passionate about, and for every 
person, I believe this passion can 
be traced back to a unique root. 
It comes from somewhere — it’s 
not just that it’s music and that 
it’s good, it’s that it’s a factor that 
often colors the way that we view 
our own lives. For me, the root was 
this: climbing onto a bus in the 
morning with the nonstop action of 
“She Loves You” still pounding in 
my head and in my heart, tapping 

my foot to the remembered chorus 
of “Ticket to Ride” on the way to 
school.

I didn’t put this all together until 

much later, but looking back, it all 
seems really simple. It’s like how 
I love Taylor Swift because my 
friend and I spent middle school 
constantly rocking out to her first 
three albums, and even though I 
moved twice to Florida and twice 
came back, the music never went 
anywhere. When I came back to 
find we had forgotten crucial parts 
of each other, we could put on 
Speak Now and bake some cookies 
or something, letting Swift’s lyrics 
become the soundtrack to us slowly 
finding our way back to each other. 
I still smile when I hear a 5 Seconds 
of Summer song because going to a 
5 Seconds of Summer concert, even 
though I only knew about one and 
a half of their songs at the time, was 
the last thing I did with my friends 
my senior year of high school.

What’s more is that knowing 

this about myself helps me see it 
in other people, too. Once, when 
I was living in Florida, I went to 
Winter Jam with a friend of mine 
— not because I was Christian or 
knew the music, but because my 
friend wouldn’t stop talking about 
how badly she wanted me to hear 
TobyMac and Jason Castro. She 
was so excited, and I wanted to see 
that happiness in action, I wanted 
to share that with her. So I went, 
and we jumped up and down to 
Christian music for a night, and it’s 
still one of my favorite things I ever 
did with her.

With music, I think, it’s easy 

to get caught up in the aspects of 
it that are the most upfront. Who 
the artists are, what they look like, 
where they’re from. The quality of 
the lyrics, the genre of the music. 
This all makes sense, and for the 
most part, it is a lot of what I base 
my taste in music on.

So when people ask me what my 

favorite band is, I always say The 
Beatles. It’s an easy answer because 
it’s an accessible one, and if people 
ever ask me why them, I usually 
give an answer that’s excited, yes, 
but restrained. I like them because 
they’re classic, because they’re 
catchy, because they did so much 
for music and were so important, 
because they’ve got enough variety 
that I’m always in the mood for at 
least one song.

And all of this is true. But when 

you get right down to it, I also 
believe that there are a lot of bands 
that are classic. There are lot of 
bands that are catchy, that have 
impacted music, etc. The fact is 
that there aren’t a lot of bands that 
made me feel at home the first time 
I moved away from Indiana. There 
aren’t a lot of bands that make me 
feel at home, every time I hear 
them, even now.

When I look back on Louisiana 

now, I don’t look back on a time 
that was largely unhappy. I 
don’t look back on a time that 
was largely happy, either — it 
was some sort of mix of both, 
like every year. I did make good 
friends there; I also had my first 
experience duct-taping all of my 
windows and evacuating before a 
hurricane. I finished writing my 
first book, and witnessed my first 
cafeteria fistfights and had my first 
awkward relationship with a boy. 
I missed all of my friends and my 
life in Indiana, but I also ended up 
finding a life that I liked in Baton 
Rouge. When I went home the 
following year, I returned with 
a 
strange 
feeling 
somewhere 

between happiness at the thought 
of coming back, and a new ache at 
having to leave Louisiana.

Between sixth grade and my 

freshman year of college, I would 
move in total seven times, and a 
certain part of this feeling never 
really went away. But it’s a feeling 
I love, and it’s a feeling that, for me, 
has always gone along with good 
music. I don’t think any year of 
one’s life can be exclusively good or 
exclusively bad, and I don’t think 
that’s how music works, either. I 
can tell you whatever I want about 
why I love The Beatles more than 

any other band — I could tell you 
it’s because they’re a great success 
story, or because they’re influential. 
I could tell you I like Taylor Swift 
because she’s a talented songwriter 
and businesswoman, or that I like 5 
Seconds of Summer because there’s 
something 
honestly 
exciting 

hidden beneath their kitschy boy-
band exterior (actually, I’d be hard-
pressed admitting that I like 5 
Seconds of Summer to anyone, but 
for argument’s sake).

But ask me again someplace 

quieter. Someplace where I have 
enough space to explain myself, 
and where I feel like you might 
actually be listening. The fact is 
that I love music because it’s one big 
story that I already know I’ll never 
know all of. I love it because it’s tied 
in so inextricably with experience, 
and because that means it can help 
you learn really important things 
about other people. And because no 
masterpiece of a song by itself will 
ever mean quite the same thing 
to me as it does to sit somewhere 
and just listen to it, right in that 
place, right in that moment, with 
somebody.

MAX KUANG/Daily

Michigan wrestling coach Joe McFarland was pleased with his team’s performance in its dominant 48-0 win over Oregon State on Sunday afternoon.

Wolverines flex muscles in win over Oregon State

As he stepped onto the mat, 

fifth-year senior Kevin Beazley 
knew he had the most daunting 
challenge of the day.

The 197-pounder was the only 

Wolverine facing a nationally 
ranked 
wrestler 
during 

Michigan’s 
matchup 
against 

Oregon State. Tensions rose 
throughout Cliff Keen Arena as 
the wrestlers squared off, but 
all doubt was quickly erased as 
Beazley pinned the 11th-ranked 
Corey Griego in the middle of the 
first period.

The match started off poorly 

for Beazley, who was taken down 
by Griego early in the round. 
Beazley responded in kind by 
quickly escaping and then taking 
down Griego before grinding 
out a hard-earned fall. Beazley 
inevitably won with a left-
handed headlock.

“That was a great moment,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland. “He had to dig his 

heels in and really drive through 
that — but he stayed tough and 
kept driving and driving through 
it and was able to get him on his 
back and secure the pin.”

This 
match 
was 
largely 

indicative of the meet as a whole, 
as every wrestler found his hand 
raised by the referee at the end 
of his match. Michigan looked 
dominant from start to finish 
as the Wolverines shut out the 
Beavers, 48-0. In total, the meet 
contained two falls and three 
technical falls, a feat which 
helped the Wolverines (2-1) earn 
a statement win for the program.

Michigan 
had 
suffered 
a 

sluggish 
start 
to 
its 
season 

after squeaking by 11th-ranked 
Arizona State, 21-18, and losing 
big 
to 
10th-ranked 
Lehigh, 

8-27. However, the Wolverines 
are showing signs of a massive 
momentum 
shift 
after 
an 

impressive showing at the Cliff 
Keen Las Vegas Invitational and a 
shutout win against Oregon State 
(2-1).

“Against 
Lehigh, 
we 
got 

punched in the face,” McFarland 
said. “We got beat on basic 
fundamentals out there, we got 
beat on mat wrestling, and so 
we’ve been working a lot on those 
areas — and we saw a lot of that 
today.”

The 
numbers 
corroborate 

McFarland’s 
claim, 
as 
no 

Wolverine wrestler trailed at the 
end of any period throughout the 
meet.

Another 
bright 
spot 
in 

Michigan’s performance can be 
found in freshman 157-pounder 
Reece Hughes. Hughes’ redshirt 
was pulled as he subbed in for 
the injured redshirt sophomore, 
165-pounder 
Logan 
Massa. 

Not only did Hughes win his 
collegiate debut, 5-0, but he did it 
while wrestling up a weight class.

“I’m real proud of him,” 

McFarland said. “It’s tough — you 
go out there for the first time, in 
a Michigan singlet, in front of the 
nice crowd, but he stayed totally 
focused, was on task and did a 
great job.”

From here, the Wolverines 

have a break until they begin Big 
Ten play on Jan. 5. McFarland 
wishes to continue along this 
positive track through the break 
and further refine his wrestlers’ 
abilities.

“This break is going to be 

awesome,” Beazley said. “We get 
to break down some technique 
and keep getting better. Focusing 
on 
getting 
better 
mentally, 

getting better physically and just 
improving every time we step on 
the mat.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
shift 

in momentum may also be 
attributable to the friendly rivalry 
that exists within the Michigan 
squad. The wrestlers frequently 
compete with each other to see 
who will earn the most points in a 
given meet or even score the most 
falls in a season.

“I think the biggest thing is 

feeding off of each other,” Beazley 
said. “We had a little bit of trash 
talk going in the group chat — and 
we just feed off each other, so 
we’re just pushing each other and 
having fun when we’re out there.”

After dominant 48-0 win, 
‘M’ picking up momentum

Entering the second period, 

fifth-year 
senior 
heavyweight 

Adam Coon narrowly led his 
opposition. 

Cliff Keen Arena was rocking 

and Coon seemed to feed off the 
atmosphere. In quick succession, 
Coon escaped Cody Crawford’s 
grasp, tallied a swift two-point 
takedown and then polished off 
the succession with a decisive fall.

With 
that 
result, 
No. 
9 

Michigan had completed a shutout 
of Oregon State, 48-0, in the third 
annual Joe Wells Classic.

“It was fun to watch,” said 

Michigan coach Joe McFarland. 
“I think the big takeaway for us 
is we’ve been working a lot of 
different positions in the practice 
room and really trying to break 
things down, and 
we saw a lot of 
that today.”

The 

Wolverines built 
on their successful 
second-place 
finish 
at 
the 

Cliff 
Keen 
Las 

Vegas Collegiate 
Wrestling 
Invitational 
last 

weekend, where 
Ohio State was the only team in a 
49-team field to better them.

After a shaky start to the season 

in which it was blown out by No. 
11 Lehigh, Michigan is bouncing 
back.

“Against 
Lehigh, 
we 
got 

punched in the face,” McFarland 
said. “There were some things 
leading up to that that we felt we 
needed to work on, but we got 
beat on the basic fundamentals 
out there, we got beat on mat 
wrestling, and so we’ve been 
working a lot in those areas. We’ve 
made some big strides in those 
areas.”

The 
strides 
were 
obvious 

against Oregon State, as three out 
of the nine matchups ended with 
Wolverines scoring a fall, and two 
others finished as technical falls.

Fifth-year 
senior 
Kevin 

Beazley scored arguably the most 
impressive of the falls, pinning 
Oregon State’s Corey Griego, in 
the first period. Griego was the 
nation’s 11th-ranked wrestler in 
the 197-pound weight class.

“I’ve never been a part of a 

shutout in college wrestling, so 
that was really cool,” Beazley 
remarked. “We don’t train for 
each opponent, we train for the 
end of the year. That’s the biggest 
point we need to get across. In 
every match we plan on getting 
better 
and 
peaking 
for 
the 

national tournament in March, 
and hopefully coming home with 
a team trophy.”

Though 
the 
national 

tournament 
is 

a few months 
away, the Big Ten 
season 
starts 

Jan. 5 with an 
away dual meet 
against Indiana. 
With 
four 

other Big Ten 
teams 
ranked 

in the top 10 
nationally, now 
is a perfect time 

for Michigan to gain top form.

“We want to continue to have 

some good training sessions, and 
work on some of the things that 
we have been the past couple of 
weeks,” McFarland said. “We’re 
going to keep training. We’ll send 
these guys home and I know 
these guys will stay on top of their 
training. Then we’ll come back 
on (December) 27th and get some 
good practices in.”

Whatever the Wolverines have 

been doing in practice recently has 
been working. If this progression 
continues, a Big Ten and possibly 
even a National Championship 
may not be a pipe dream.

For the Daily

I’ve never been a 

part of a shutout 

in college 

wrestling.

MAX KUANG/Daily

Senior forward Dexter Dancs improved his body this offseason, and his play has followed after a lackluster junior year.

Hard work pays off for Dancs in senior season

Goals 
in 
hockey 
aren’t 

like home runs in baseball 
or touchdowns in football. 
When pucks go into the net, 
there exists an element of pure 
chance that’s not as present in 
almost any other sport.

That’s why it can often be 

challenging to glean too much 
from them — goals only tell 
part of the story. But for Dexter 
Dancs last season, they told 
more than enough.

A 
seven-goal, 
17-point 

sophomore campaign gave way 
to a disappointing junior season 
in which Dancs only found the 
net once. Dancs wasn’t alone 
in his struggles, as Michigan’s 
entire offense plummeted from 
4.76 goals per game in 2015-16 
to just 2.63 last year.

“It’s no secret I haven’t had 

the best three years here,” 
Dancs admitted to the Detroit 
Free Press at Michigan’s media 
day in September. “(I) haven’t 
played as well as I’ve wanted 
to or the coaching staff wanted 
me to.”

During the offseason, Dancs 

knew 
what 
he 
needed 
to 

improve upon to put the sour 
taste of his junior year behind 
him, so the North Vancouver, 
B.C. native went back home, 

something 
he 
hadn’t 
done 

in any prior offseason. His 
training focus changed, too. 
For the first time, he worked 
primarily on his flexibility and 
mobility on the ice.

“I worked with a guy back 

home and my body feels a lot 
different than it did the last 
few years,” Dancs said. “I feel 
good — not necessarily faster, 
but I just feel stronger in my 
skates and my edges and things 
like that, so I think it’s been big 
for me.

“Last year I would get the 

puck in my own end and guys 
would catch me, or I would get 
it in the corner, I’d spin off a 
defender and get caught. This 
year I just feel better.”

At the Wolverines’ media 

day, coach Mel Pearson stated 
that Dancs had the potential to 
be an “x-factor,” calling him a 
major key towards Michigan 
having success. And through 
the first two months of the 
season, a more physically fit 
Dancs has proven him correct.

In just 16 games, Dancs has 

already surpassed his scoring 
output from last season, with 
five goals and eight assists 
comprising his 13 points — 
good for third on the team. 
With this success, he has 
asserted himself on Michigan’s 
top 
line 
alongside 
senior 

Tony Calderone and forward 
Cooper 
Marody, 
anchoring 

the Wolverines’ 15th-ranked 
scoring offense.

While Marody’s total of 

1.5 points per game is tied 
for fourth in the country, 
as are Calderone’s 13 goals, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
veteran 

triumvirate 
has 
owed 
its 

success just as heavily to the 
contributions of Dancs. His 
size, strength and hard-nosed 
play 
in 
physical 
situations 

provides space for Michigan’s 
other playmakers. As Pearson 
stated after a victory over 
Minnesota in November, Dancs 
gives the line “a little bit of 
everything.”

“He’s always been a hard 

worker, but I think all around 
the ice he’s doing a lot of good 
things,” 
Marody 
said. 
“In 

practice, he’s always pretty 
consistent on a daily basis and 
he’s working really hard — 
getting pucks, he’s using his 
shot, he’s using his big body to 
take it to the net.”

It’s 
also 
telling 
toward 

the 
line’s 
chemistry 
and 

cohesiveness as a unit that 
Calderone was quick to credit 
his linemates for his hat trick 
against 
Michigan 
State 
on 

Thursday, saying that they 
“made it easy” for him.

“Dex, he’s a workhorse,” 

Calderone said. “He gets into 
the dirty areas, gets the puck, 
gives it to Coop, who’s an all-
around great 
passer, great 

with the puck and shooting, 
so we’ve got three guys that 
complement each other well.”

While Marody gave praise 

to Dancs’ work ethic, he also 
put 
forth 
experience 
and 

confidence as reasons why 
Dancs is enjoying the best 
season of his career.

“As a senior, you’ve had a lot 

of years to know how you have 
to play on a daily basis, know 
how to play in the games,” 
Marody said. “He’s been here 
for four years, worked hard 
four years and sometimes it just 
comes with time. You get more 
mature, you learn more things 
about the game, you learn more 
things about your game, what 
it takes to have success and I 
think he’s learned that and he’s 
been very good so far.”

But 
despite 
this 
praise 

from teammates and coaches, 
Dancs was more lukewarm in 
his evaluation of his play this 
season, noting his streakiness 
— 11 of his 13 points came 
during an eight-game stretch 
from Oct. 27 to Nov. 17.

With 
three 
weeks 
until 

Michigan takes the ice again, 
against 
Bowling 
Green 
in 

the Great Lakes Invitational, 
Dancs hopes to develop that 
consistency.

“The last five or six games 

I haven’t really been happy 
with my game,” Dancs said. 
“It’s good that we have the 20 
days off so I can kind of look 
back on it and see what made 
me successful and bring that to 
the second half of the season.”

After a summer dedicated 

to improving his game and 
redeeming himself after a self-
professed unexceptional three 
years, Dancs has blossomed 
into not just an “x-factor” for 
the Wolverines, as Pearson 
had hoped, but a major force 
for one of the more surprising 
offenses in the country.

And while there’s plenty of 

hard work involved, maybe it’s 
as simple as pucks finally going 
into the net.

Michigan special teams 
talented but inconsistent

Entering 2017, all the talent was 

there.

Unfortunately for Michigan, 

though, the talent didn’t yield many 
highlights.

HIGH POINT: Any time a 

Wolverine kicker sets a record, 
Michigan fans are bound to tune 
in. That’s exactly what happened 
earlier in the season when Nordin 
became the first Wolverine to ever 
hit two 50-yard field goals in the 
same game.

Nordin did so against Florida, 

in Cowboys Stadium, in the season 
opener. He converted four out of 
six field goals that game, boosting 
Michigan to a 33-17 win, and the 
hype behind the kicker escalated 
quickly.

But just as quickly as the hype 

rose, it would fall just as hard — but 
more on that in the section below.

The Wolverines didn’t have 

many big plays on special teams 
this season, but freshman Donovan 
Peoples-Jones’ 79-yard punt return 
touchdown against Air Force 
added at least one highlight to the 
reel.

Peoples-Jones weaved in and 

out of the Falcons’ return coverage, 
speeding past the entire unit for 
Michigan’s first touchdown of the 
day. Peoples-Jones made a handful 
of questionable decisions regarding 
fair catches this season — it even 
cost him his job at one point — but 
Harbaugh stuck with him, and it 
seems like the right decision.

LOW POINT: For all the 

success Nordin had to open the 
year, things quickly turned sour.

Given its place in the Wolverines’ 

season, it’s almost fitting that 
Nordin’s season began going off the 
rails in Happy Valley.

Michigan quickly fell into a 

14-point hole to open the game 
thanks to Saquon Barkley. The 
Wolverines’ first punch back came 
at the beginning of the first quarter, 
when junior running back Karan 
Higdon found the end zone.

Out trotted Nordin. Moments 

later, he trotted off having missed 
the extra point wide left.

And so began his downward 

spiral.

He missed from 37 and 49 yards 

against Rutgers and another extra 
point against Minnesota.

Then things came to a head 

in College Park. Nordin missed 
from 31 yards before getting into 
what looked like an animated 
conversation 
with 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh.

After the game, Harbaugh 

clarified there was no animosity in 
the conversation. But he did deliver 
a simple message.

“He didn’t really snap back,” 

Harbaugh said of Nordin. “I said to 
him, ‘I’m giving you one more shot. 
You’ve got to make the next one.’ 
And he said, ‘I got this. I will make 
the next one.’ ”

As it turns out, Nordin did. He 

briefly corrected course against 
Wisconsin — converting on each 
of his field goal and extra-point 
attempts. But his last kick of the 
regular season ended with a block 
by the Buckeyes.

THE FUTURE: Not a whole lot 

will change for the special teams 
crew.

Nordin will be back, and 

freshman punter Brad Robbins will 
be back, too. In the return game, 
Peoples-Jones will stick around 
to return punts, and freshman 
defensive back Ambry Thomas, 
who returned kickoffs all year, will 
also be available next season.

The most notable change, and 

perhaps the most significant, is the 
loss of holder Garrett Moores.

Moores, the previous Mortell 

Holder of the Year award winner, 
is out of eligibility after this 
season. Though he failed to 
repeat as the HOTY winner — an 
accomplishment no holder has 
previously ever achieved — Moores 
still had a solid season.

And for all the parody videos 

he makes on Twitter in the name 
of self-deprecating humor, Moores 
was good at his job.

It has yet to be seen who is going 

to take his spot, but they’ll certainly 
have big shoes to fill.

Shea Patterson announces transfer to Michigan

It’s official: Shea Patterson is 

coming to Ann Arbor.

Monday afternoon, Patterson 

announced his intent to transfer 
to Michigan from Ole Miss, 
capping off a recruitment that 
only came to light recently.

“Thank you to the wonderful 

people, teammates and coaches 
at Ole Miss. It is a special place 
and I will always have great 
memories of my experiences 
in Oxford,” Patterson wrote in 
a statement on Twitter. “I am 
now excited to announce my 
commitment to continue my 
athletic and academic career at 
The University of Michigan. It’s 
time to go to work.”

Things 
between 
the 
two 

parties progressed quickly. Jim 
Harbaugh paid a visit to Oxford 
last week before Patterson — 
along with two teammates, 

Deontay Anderson and Van 
Jefferson — returned the favor 
this past weekend. The trio 
was seen at Saturday’s men’s 
basketball game against UCLA.

Patterson’s 
decision 
to 

transfer was likely influenced 
by 
the 
punishment 
handed 

down to Ole Miss by the NCAA, 
which included a two-year bowl 
ban and multiple scholarship 
restrictions, in addition to the 
school’s self-imposed bowl ban 
this season.

By now, of course, most 

fans will have heard of the 
sophomore phenom.

Formerly 
the 
top-ranked 

quarterback 
recruit 
in 
the 

nation, Patterson started 10 
games over his first two years 
playing for the Rebels. As a 
freshman, he filled in capably for 
an injured Chad Kelly, leading 
Ole Miss to an upset road win 
over then-No. 8 Texas A&M in 
his first collegiate game.

Patterson 
won 
the 

quarterback 
competition 

entering this fall. Through the 
first seven games, Patterson 
completed 
63.8 
percent 
of 

his passes for 2,259 yards, 
17 
touchdowns 
and 
nine 

interceptions before a torn PCL 
sidelined him for the remainder 
of the year. At the time of his 
injury, he was leading the 
conference in passing yards.

Both Wilton Speight and 

Alex Malzone have announced 
their intent to transfer from 
Michigan, 
which 
would 

leave Patterson as the most 
experienced 
quarterback 
on 

the roster next year — and the 
quarterback 
with 
the 
most 

production, as well.

Historically, 
Michigan 
is 

not a school that pursues many 
transfers, let alone multiple 
from the same school. But 
Harbaugh does have experience 
in 
successfully 
pursuing 

quarterback transfers. In early 
2015, Jake Rudock left Iowa as 
a graduate transfer to finish 
his career at Michigan. Around 
that same time, John O’Korn 
chose to transfer from Houston, 
sitting out one year before 
appearing in 16 games over the 
past two seasons.

It remains to be seen whether 

Patterson will be able to display 
his talent next year as he — and 
Michigan — awaits word on 
whether he will have immediate 
eligibility.

Harbaugh 
and 
Michigan 

have yet to provide official 
comment on the transfer. The 
official 
Michigan 
football 

Twitter account did, though, 
tacitly acknowledge the news 
by 
retweeting 
Patterson’s 

tweet announcing his decision. 
Patterson was unable to speak 
with media during his visit this 
past weekend, as transfers fall 
under NCAA recruiting rules.

Michigan coach John Beilein and the Wolverines will attempt to exorcise their road demons when they travel to Austin on Tuesday to face Texas.

Wolverines prepare for road test at Texas 

Before 
Michigan’s 

season began, it was easy 
to identify the toughest 
part of its schedule: the 
beginning.

The Wolverines’ first 12 

games included matchups 
with No. 7 North Carolina, 
Indiana, Ohio State, UCLA 
and several tough games 
at the Maui Invitational. 
Tuesday, that stretch will 
conclude when Michigan 
(1-1 Big Ten, 8-3 overall) 
travels to face Texas (6-2). 
Through eight games, he 
was averaging 15.3 points 
per game and shooting 52.4 
percent. 

It 
appears 
the 

Wolverines are catching 
somewhat of a break, as 
Longhorns guard Andrew 
Jones – the team’s leading 
scorer – will miss Tuesday’s 
game with a wrist injury. 
After finishing third on 
the team in scoring last 

year, Jones tested the 
waters of the NBA 
Draft this offseason 

before ultimately deciding 
to return to school.

Without 
Jones, 

Texas will turn to one 
of the best frontcourts 
Michigan 
will 
face 

all 
season. 
Forwards 

Dylan 
Osetkowski 

and Mohamed Bamba 
average 14.0 and 10.7 
points 
per 
game, 

respectively, 
while 

combining 
for 
18 

rebounds per game.

The 
Wolverines 

actively recruited Bamba, 
who was the No. 3 recruit 
in the class of 2017. In fact, 
the 7-footer took a visit to 
Ann Arbor in September of 
last year, before choosing to 
sign with the Longhorns. 
Osetkowski, on the other 
hand, played his first two 
years at Tulane, where he 
averaged 8.9 points per 
game before transferring 

to Texas.

“Mo 
Bamba’s 
a 

tremendous player, but the 
transfer they have from 
Tulane is the guy that’s 

really been tremendous 
for them this year,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein. “That’s the guy 
that, maybe, they were 
missing last year. A guy – 
an inside threat, outside 
threat. He’s really a good 
player.”

Another 
challenge 

that Michigan will have 
to overcome is its trouble 

playing on the road this 
season.

When the Wolverines 

traveled to Chapel Hill, 
N.C., they were run off the 
court. A week later, they 
blew a 20-point lead to 
Ohio State. In both games, 
Michigan was unable to 
effectively respond when 
its opponents went on 
runs.

Perhaps the Wolverines 

have 
exorcised 
those 

demons, though. Saturday, 
they overcame a 15-point 
deficit to beat UCLA. Now, 
they have to prove that 
they can do the same thing 
on the road.

Michigan experienced 

trouble in road games last 
season, but it’s a different 
team 
now, 
and 
the 

Wolverines have to prove 
once again that they can 
contend with good teams 
away from Crisler Center.

“It’s been tough in the 

past, too,” Wagner said. 

“Last year, I remember, we 
were 0-6 (up) to the Indiana 
game in the middle of the 
Big Ten season on the road. 
So, it’s obviously tough, 
whether that’s young or old 
and a (more) mature team. 
But we don’t have that in 
the back of our mind. We 
just play basketball and try 
not to focus on that.”

The 
Longhorns 
and 

Wolverines 
have 
an 

opponent in common this 
season. Both have played 
VCU, and both beat the 
Rams 
in 
close 
games. 

Those contests could act as 
a barometer for how close 
Tuesday’s game could be. 
Currently, Texas is listed as 
a six-point favorite. Beilein, 
for his part, believes that’s 
true.

“They’ve got enough 

good players,” Beilein said. 
“… And we’re going to have 
to play, probably, our best 
game of the year to get a 
win at Texas.”

Despite win, Michigan 
bench still struggles

As Kent State jumped out to 

an early lead over the Michigan 
women’s basketball team on 
Sunday, 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 

found a lane and drove through 
it. On her way to the hoop, a 
Golden Flash defender stepped 
in front and drew a whistle, 
earning the ball back with Kent 
State already up 8-2.

Everyone 
on 
the 
Golden 

Flash bench got up. Everyone 
cheered. It echoed through the 
confines of Crisler Center on a 
lazy Sunday afternoon.

The Wolverines eventually 

found their footing and came 
back to win 54-41. In doing so, 
however, not once was their 
bench anywhere near as loud 
as Kent State’s when the Golden 
Flash were up.

This isn’t a one-game issue 

either. When Detroit jumped out 
to an early lead over Michigan 
last Tuesday, the Titans were 
jumping around the bench, 
yelling 
encouragement 
and 

celebrating. 
The 
Wolverines 

were sitting.

“I don’t think we’re like a 

rah-rah team,” junior guard 
Nicole Munger said. “I think 
we’re more like a working, blue-
collar team.”

Added 
freshman 
forward 

Hailey Brown: “Even if our 
bench isn’t playing, at timeouts, 
they’re always telling us stuff 
about personnel or just things 
that are going on in the game. So 
it may not be the loudest, but it’s 
still, like, subtle conversations 
that we’re constantly having.”

The team’s messaging on 

this 
issue, 
however, 
wasn’t 

especially consistent.

“I think our bench has great 

energy,” coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “And I think Jillian 
Dunston, Deja Church are our 
biggest energy kids, but our 
bench is usually led by Deja 
Church, Kayla Robbins – she 
always has a voice on our 
bench – as does Sam Trammel. 
So I think our kids have great 

energy, great focus.”

According to Munger and 

Brown, the team’s solemnity 
on the bench is a good thing. 
According to Barnes Arico, 
there is no lack of energy on 
the bench. Both of those things 
can’t be true. It’s hard to believe 
either of those things could be 
true.

There’s 
no 
reason 
more 

energy on the bench wouldn’t 
stop Michigan from giving 
strategic advice. If anything, it 
might help if everyone was up 
and cheering.

In fairness to Barnes Arico, 

there are ways to give the team 
momentum other than shouting 
encouragement from the bench. 
Dunston, Church and Robbins 
have all done so on the court 
by grabbing loose balls, playing 
hard defense and doing any 
number of other things.

Outside of the coaching staff, 

however, it’s rare to see any 
Wolverine standing, clapping or 
doing anything else other than 
sitting when it comes to the 
bench itself.

“When 
you 
have 
that 

(ranking) next to you, it means 
a lot more than just a number,” 
Munger said. “It’s like a target 
on your back. So they’re playing 
like a targeted team. So we need 
to know that coming in that 
everyone’s coming to beat us.”

And as far as intangibles go, 

energy does matter. It’s easier 
to build momentum when your 
teammates are up and excited.

“The 
conversations 
we 

have with our bench (are) 
more crucial than them just 
being rah-rah because they’re 
giving me advice, things that 
they see that I don’t see on the 
court,” Munger stressed. “If 
I’m busy looking at this, this, 
and they say, ‘Skip,’ well there’s 
(Flaherty) wide open in the 
corner.” 

In 
that 
hypothetical, 

though, wouldn’t it be nice to 
hear the Wolverines cheering 
after Flaherty hits her open 
3-pointer?
