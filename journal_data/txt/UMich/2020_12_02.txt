At the University of Michigan’s 

2018 Winter Commencement, 
Lynn Conway, professor emerita 
of electrical engineering and 
computer science, encouraged 
the graduating class to embrace 
changes and transitions as an 
inevitable part of their future 
adventures. 

“You’re embarking in an era 

of accelerating social change,” 
Conway said. “You’ll encounter 
increasingly 
diverse, 
often 

conflicting ways of thinking.”

She then stepped away from 

the stage to give the class of 2018 
their moment to shine. But on 
Oct. 14, 2020, Conway was the 
one in the spotlight.

At a public event celebrating 

LGBTQ+ 
inclusion, 
the 

International Business Machines 
Corporation presented Conway 
with a rare lifetime achievement 
award. The award accompanied 
IBM’s apology to Conway, which 
came 52 years after the company 
fired her for coming out as 
transgender. 

The 
apology 
epitomized 

what Conway had preached in 
her 
commencement 
address: 

positive change occurs when 
people come together to build 

a future that transcends the 
shortcomings of the past.

Though not a household name 

like Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla 
or Alan Turing, Conway appears 
alongside them in Electronic 
Design’s “Hall of Fame” for 
revolutionizing the microchip, 
which powers technologies from 
smartphones to spacecrafts. In 
1964, Conway began researching 
supercomputers at IBM as a 
man.

Four years later, Conway 

decided to transition and receive 
gender-affirmation 
medical 

care. When she came out, IBM, 
then led by Chief Executive 
Officer T.J. Watson Jr., fired her.

In her memoir, “IBM-ACS: 

Reminiscences 
and 
Lessons 

Learned 
From 
a 
1960’s 

Supercomputer
Project,” 

Conway reflected on the logic 
behind 
IBM’s 
decision. 
She 

wrote 
that 
IBM 
executives 

were concerned that her gender 
transition 
would 
affect 
the 

mental health of her co-workers, 
since 
stigma 
surrounding 

transgender 
people 
was 
so 

pervasive at that time.

“I learned later … that the 

executives feared scandalous 
publicity if my story ever got 
out,” Conway wrote. 

The Michigan Daily sat down 

with Arnold Monto, professor of 
epidemiology at the University 
of Michigan’s School of Public 
Health and recently appointed 
chair of the Food and Drug 
Administration’s 
committee 

evaluating COVID-19 vaccines, 
over the phone on Tuesday, 
Nov. 24. He discussed his role 
on the committee, background 
working with vaccines and how 
the COVID-19 vaccine process 
has worked as a result of the 
pandemic. This interview has 
been edited and condensed for 
clarity. 

The Michigan Daily: What 

is your background working 
with vaccines? 

Arnold Monto: Well, I’ve 

been working here at the 
University of Michigan for 
more than 50 years, working 
with influenza vaccines since 
the start. Matter of fact, during 
the 1968 pandemic, I was 
involved in the study, trying to 
see if you vaccinate school-aged 
children in the community, if 
you can reduce transmission 
in the entire community. This 
is a demonstration of herd 
immunity. So I’ve been at this 
for a long time. Currently, our 
Center (the University “Flu 
Lab”), which I head along with 
Emily Martin, who is very 
much involved in the local 
response, has been evaluating 
influenza vaccines in terms of 
prevention of mild and severe 
influenza.

TMD: How did you get onto 

the committee to evaluate the 
COVID-19 vaccine?

AM: 
The 
Vaccines 
and 

Related Biological Products 
Advisory 
Committee 
is 
a 

standing committee of the 
FDA with four-year terms. 
I was selected to be on that 
committee 
in 
2016 
and 
I 

was chairman for four years 
starting in February 2016. I 
rotated off at the start of this 
year in January, but I was 
asked to come back to chair the 
committee for COVID-19. So it 
was the choice of FDA for me to 
be brought back.

TMD: Recently, there has 

been encouraging news about 
possible COVID-19 vaccines: 
early data from Pfizer’s and 
Moderna’s vaccines show more 
than 90 percent efficacy, with 
AstraZeneca also producing 
somewhat promising results. 
Can you give me some of your 
general thoughts about the 
vaccine timeline, specifically 
what creating a vaccine has 
looked like for the different 
pharmaceutical companies?

AM: Coronavirus vaccines 

have 
been 
produced 
more 

rapidly 
than 
traditionally, 

because 
the 
production 

schedule has been telescoped. 
In 
other 
words, 
because 

funding is available and the 
process for the manufacturers 
has been de-risked, they have 
been able to do things which 
they would generally do in 
sequence, in parallel.

LSA senior Amytess Girgis 

recently 
became 
the 
29th 

student from the University of 
Michigan to receive the Rhodes 
Scholarship, the oldest and 
most prestigious international 
scholarship 
program. 
Girgis 

was awarded the honor for her 
work in campus and community 
organizing and for her thesis 
researching the increase in 
mutual aid groups in the wake 

of the current pandemic. 

The scholarship funds all 

expenses for two to three years 
of study at the University of 
Oxford in England. In this 
year’s list of Rhodes Scholars, 
22 of the 32 Americans chosen 
are students of color, 10 of whom 
are Black, which is the most 
chosen in one year, according 
to the Rhodes Trust press 
release. Nine of the winners are 
first-generation Americans or 
immigrants and one is a DACA 
Dreamer. Additionally, 17 of the 
winners identify as female and 

one as non-binary. 

Girgis is graduating in the 

spring from the University with 
a degree in Political Science. She 
will head to the University of 
Oxford in fall 2021 and told The 
Michigan Daily she is leaning 
toward getting a doctorate in 
philosophy, political science, 
sociology 
or 
anything 
that 

would allow her to specifically 
study social movements. 

Though she is honored to 

win, Girgis said she has some 
conflicting feelings about the 
scholarship and is still digesting 

what it means to be a Rhodes 
Scholar-elect. 

“My primary reaction is 

shock, I still haven’t fully 
internalized that this is really 
happening,” Girgis said. “My 
second 
reaction 
is 
feeling 

the responsibility of what it 
means to carry this title and to 
head to Oxford with all of the 
opportunities it affords and 
what it looks like to take that 
opportunity on behalf of those 
who never get a chance.”

University of Michigan Law 

School alum Theary Seng cut 
her hair live on Radio Free Asia 
this past Thursday. It was not for 
fashion but convenience: should 
she go to jail the next week, she 
wanted to be prepared to deal with 
lice. 

Seng is a well-known political 

activist in Cambodia. She has 
frequently spoken out against 
Prime Minister Hun Sen and his 
government, 
criticizing 
them 

for abusing human rights and 
acting undemocratically. Now, the 
government has charged her with 
committing treason and inciting 
social 
disorder. 
According 
to 

Seng’s lawyer, 60 other activists, 
most of whom reside out of the 
country, have been charged with 
similar counts.

“It’s a show trial,” Seng said in 

an interview with The Michigan 
Daily. 

Human 
rights 
defenders 

have criticized the Hun Sen 
government 
for 
politically-

motivated trials used to imprison 
dozens of journalists, activists and 
members of the opposition party.

Still, Seng is adamant about 

showing up to court. At 8:30 a.m. 
on Thanksgiving Day, Seng will 
defend herself against a jury that 
is likely heavily influenced by the 

government. She will also go to 
court without having received 
an indictment, meaning that she 
doesn’t know what evidence the 
government will present against 
her.

According to Jared Genser, 

a fellow Michigan Law alum 
who has worked with political 
dissidents, this is a violation of 
both Cambodian and international 
law. Genser is representing Seng 
pro bono. 

“What’s happening to Theary 

is, unfortunately, part of a much 
bigger pattern and practice of 
repression of human rights in 
Cambodia,” he said. 

Seng’s former Michigan Law 

classmate 
Glenn 
Kaminsky 

organized a GoFundMe to pay 
for her legal expenses. They 
have crowdfunded a little under 
$13,000 as of Monday afternoon

Seng sought refuge in the 

United States at age nine after both 
her parents were murdered by the 
Khmer Rouge. She and her brother 
moved to Michigan in the middle 
of the winter in 1980, calling the 
transition to cold weather and a 
new culture “baptism by fire.” 

Seng 
said 
she 
considers 

Michigan her home in the U.S. 

“Oh, I love Michigan with all 

my heart,” she said. “It was my 
first introduction to the United 
States.”

During 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic, and after a graduate 
student strike and a contested 
presidential election, University 
of Michigan undergraduates are 
still applying to graduate schools. 
And for grad school applications, 
grades matter.

Though 
the 
University 

unveiled a new grading policy for 
the 2020-21 school year, allowing 
students to display “Pass” on their 
transcript for grades above C- 
and “No Record Covid” for those 
D- and below, students applying 
to graduate schools said they are 
worried schools will assume the 
worst if they see masked grades 
on their transcripts. 

The University released its 

new policy after months of 
student advocacy for a revised 
grading policy. Central Student 
Government, 
the 
largest 

representative assembly at the 
University, passed a resolution 
demanding the implementation 
of the winter 2020 grading policy 
for the 2020-21 school year. 
LSA senior Cameron Roehm 
started a petition advocating for 
the University to apply P/NRC 
grading to the fall semester. 

CSG President Amanda Kaplan, 

a Public Policy senior, spoke on 
the widespread support from 
the student body for an adjusted 
grading policy at the Nov. 2 CSG 
meeting.

“This is a crazy semester,” 

Kaplan said. “Over 10% of the 
student body has officially signed 
on in support (of the resolution). 
The 
overwhelming 
amount 

of support demonstrates that 
students really feel like they need 
this.” 

LSA senior Timmy Li, who will 

be applying to medical school next 
year, said despite the pandemic, 
the expectation to do well still 
remains.

“I 
haven’t 
been 
severely 

affected (by COVID-19), and I 
haven’t had any major family 
issues or health issues of my own. 
And so, because of that, I feel like 
I still have the pressure to impress 
the schools and show to them that 
I can still get a good grade,” Li 
said.

LSA senior Jessica Baker, who 

applied to medical schools last 
semester, echoed Li’s concerns. 
Baker also said she feels most 
at ease when graduate schools 
acknowledge 
challenges 
that 

come with online learning in their 
application processes.

“I think as a pre-med student, 

you basically had to reveal your 
grades, because if you left them 
Pass/No Record (Covid) … it 
shows to the medical schools that 
there’s a reason why you’re hiding 
the grade, and so it kind of forces 
you to expose them,” Baker said.

LSA senior Claire Hubbell said 

she will be applying to physician 
assistant programs this year. 
Hubbell said she would like to use 
the new grading policies, but feels 
that she needs to show programs 
she excelled in a course. 

“I would love to use P/NRC 

on (pre-requisite courses), but I 
really can’t, because I need them 
to show up to show that I got an 
A for these grad schools,” Hubbell 
said. 

She said she felt the new 

grading policies are beneficial to 
undergrads who aren’t planning 
on attending grad school, but not 
so much to those who are. 

“Pass/NRC is really great for 

a lot of people that maybe aren’t 
(applying to graduate school), 
but for pre-health kids — for kids 
that are really set on going to 
grad school right after undergrad 
— it really is not much of a help, 
because you can’t really use it,” 
Hubbell said. 

Public Policy senior Mariana 

Perez is applying to law schools 
this semester and said she feels if 
she uses the P/NRC option, law 
schools will assume a low grade. 

“It 
feels 
like 
a 
lose-lose 

situation,” Perez said. “If I put it 
as a pass, I feel like law schools are 
just going to assume that it was a 
C+.”

Paul 
Robinson, 
interim 

vice 
provost 
for 
enrollment 

management and associate vice 
provost, wrote in an email to The 
Michigan Daily that students’ 
decisions to convert a letter 
grade to a “Pass” or an “NRC” to 
a letter grade should depend on 
the programs where they plan 
to apply and the importance of 
the individual class in a student’s 
application. 

“Many 
graduate 
programs 

want to see a letter grade and the 
associated GPA. So, there will 
be cases where a letter grade is 

needed,” Robinson said. “On the 
other hand, there may be courses 
where 
converting 
the 
letter 

grade to a ‘Pass’ is advantageous 
- especially in the case where a 
student’s GPA might be negatively 
affected.” 

Though 
students 
said 
the 

University’s new grading policy 
has taken a little pressure off, they 
said the best support would be 
leniency from professors and clear 
communication from graduate 
schools. 

Hubbell said she feels there are 

other actions the University could 
take to help students, like talking 
to professors about leniency with 
deadlines.

“The P/F option is definitely 

really good for a big handful of 
students, but I also feel like what 
would most help all students, 
regardless of what your post-grad 
plans are, is just having professors 
that care and are willing to work 
with you,” Hubbell said. 

She said some of her professors 

do not understand why students 
are finding this semester more 
challenging but hopes they begin 
to prioritize learning over strictly 
sticking to syllabi and deadlines. 

“I know a lot of professors are 

worried about grade inflation 
and stuff like that with the online 
format, but I think professors and 
administrators (should) just keep 
in mind that the best thing for our 
students right now is making sure 
that we’re learning,” Hubbell said.

More than 2,300 students 

began the application process 
for the scholarship this year, 
according to the Rhodes Trust.

As a woman of color, Girgis 

said she is also coming to terms 
with the complicated legacy of the 
Rhodes Scholarship. The grant 
was originally founded in 1902 by 
Cecil Rhodes, a vocal supporter 
of British imperialism and the 
eugenics movement. 

“I’m 
both 
celebrating 
& 

mourning the fact that the title 
‘Rhodes Scholar’ next to the name 
of an Iranian-Egyptian-American 
woman has Cecil Rhodes turning 
over in his grave,” Girgis wrote in a 
tweet following the announcement 
that she had won. 

Though unsure what she wants 

to do in the long run, Girgis said 
she is excited to take advantage of 
the opportunities the scholarship 
presents and help create a more 
equitable future for people of all 
backgrounds. 

“At the same time, the Rhodes 

Trust has for a very long time now 
been really doing incredible work, 
and selecting incredible scholars 
and contributing to a more just 
world,” Girgis said. “But to me, that 
tension still exists between those 
two truths. And I look forward 

to working with other Rhodes 
Scholars and Rhodes alumni to 
keep working for reconciliation 
and reparations.”

Henry Dyson, director of the 

Office of National Scholarships 
and Fellowships at the University, 
worked closely with Girgis during 
the application process for both 
the Rhodes Scholarship and the 
Truman Scholarship. 

Though Girgis did not win 

the Truman Scholarship during 
her 
junior 
year, 
Dyson 
said 

her candidacy set her up to 
eventually 
become 
a 
Rhodes 

Scholar-elect this year. He said 
he admires Girgis’s resilience and 
determination. 

“I think one big takeaway 

that I have with Amytess is that 
it takes perseverance on these 
things,” Dyson said. “In the case 
of Amytess, she is phenomenal, 
but even phenomenal students 
don’t always get selected for these 
things.”

Additionally, Dyson said he 

believes Girgis makes a great 
recipient because of her dedication 
to many different commitments 
outside 
of 
academics at the 

University. 
Girgis 
is 
heavily 

involved in various organizing 
efforts 
with 
the 
Lecturers’ 

Employee Organization and the 
One University campaign. 

“I 
think 
Amytess 
is 
just 

emblematic 
of 
what 
the 

contemporary Rhodes Scholarship 
is trying to do, which is to identify 
future leaders who are going to 
work for greater justice, for greater 
equity and for greater inclusion,” 
Dyson said. “That’s been the 
heart of all of Amytess’s work. … 
She wants to really identify the 
stories of those who have been 
marginalized in our economic and 
political systems and to raise up 
their voices.”

LSA lecturer and president of 

LEO Ian Robinson said he has 
worked with Girgis in the past 
on LEO initiatives and the 1U 
campaign and is grateful for the 
impact she has helped make in the 
surrounding community. 

Last year, LEO and 1U led 

a 
campaign 
calling 
for 
the 

University’s Board of Regents to 
provide better funding and further 
access to resources at the U-M 
Flint and Dearborn campuses to 
encourage equity between the 
University’s 
three 
campuses. 

Robinson said Girgis was one of 
the activists who was instrumental 
in extending the Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion funds to the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses. 

“Amytess played a critical role 

in informing and organizing her 
Ann Arbor peers to support the 
extension of DEI principles to 
students on the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses,” 
Robinson 
said. 

“Amytess’s many contributions to 

the 1U campaign have undoubtedly 
moved us further and faster 
towards our goals than we would 
have been able to do without her.” 

Abdul 
El-Sayed, 
a 
2018 

Michigan gubernatorial candidate 
and University alum, also received 
the Rhodes Scholarship as part of 
the 2009 cohort. El-Sayed served 
on the Truman Scholarship and 
the Rhodes Scholarship naming 
committees and worked with 
Girgis personally during his 2018 
gubernatorial campaign. 

“So incredibly proud today. 

The best part of growing up is 
watching the ones who come next 
grow & emerge,” El-Sayed wrote 
in a tweet.

Girgis advised other aspiring 

students at the University to not get 
caught up with the competitive 
nature of college and to instead 
pursue their passions. 

“The 
absolute 
most 

important thing I would ask 
anyone to do is to really ground 
themselves in the beauty of the 
community,” Girgis said. “Focus 
on who they are and what it is that 
they hope to accomplish, and also 
towards what end? Who are they 
helping? Why? I think if we can 
all ground ourselves in those facts, 
we’ll be okay.”

& For The Daily


In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, an IBM spokesperson 
wrote that IBM established 
history’s 
first 
corporate 

“equal 
opportunity 
policy” 

in 
1953, 
which 
prohibited 

discrimination on the basis 
of “race, color and creed.” 
However, the spokesperson 
wrote that the company did 
not specifically protect non-
cisgender 
individuals, 
like 

Conway, until 2002.

Conway told The Daily 

“she lived her life in stealth” 
after IBM. She resumed her 
research 
career 
at 
other 

technological 
companies 

under her new identity as 
a woman until she “quietly 
came out” as transgender 
by creating a website while 
working as a professor at the 
University in 1999. 

Conway could have ended 

her 
connection 
to 
IBM 

entirely. However, she said 
she felt compelled to contact 
them 
again 
around 
1999 

and gain permission to self-
publish the research she had 
done while employed by the 
company.

“I realized I had to come 

out more widely,” Conway 
said. “I was worried about 
my deadname being on their 
papers.”

Conway said IBM allowed 

her to post the documents on 
her website, but they did not 
formally express any regrets 
for firing her at the time.

Meanwhile, 
Conway’s 

website 
was 
gaining 

worldwide attention, and not 
only from fellow engineers. 
Other transgender individuals 
also began to regard her as a 
mentor.

“More 
and 
more 
trans 

people 
around 
the 
world 

were learning about my story 
because my web pages back 
then were one of the few blog 
sites that trans people around 
the world went to,” Conway 
said. “My page was translated 
by volunteer translators into 
many languages … it was part 
of the Trans Revolution.” 

Tara 
Maclachlan, 
the 

vice president of industrial 
internet of things strategy 
at Inmarsat, a technology 
company 
in 
the 
United 

Kingdom, has been virtually 
following 
Conway’s 
story 

since 2000. Maclachlan, like 
Conway, is a trans woman 
working in a STEM field, 
and she has also previously 
worked with IBM.

Maclachlan told The Daily 

she feels a deep connection 
to 
Conway 
because 
of 

their similarities. She said 
Conway’s story has inspired 
her to proudly publicize her 
own gender identity and to 
pursue happiness in her work 
and personal life.

“I think Lynn is one of my 

true role models,” Maclachlan 
said. “I don’t use that word 
lightly. I think the fact that 
she stood up for what she 
believed in before it was even 
close to being commonplace is 
such an inspiration.”

Maclachlan also had the 

chance to hear Conway speak 
at a technology conference 
in Washington D.C., a couple 
years ago. Maclachlan said 
it was empowering to see an 
openly transgender woman 
acknowledged for her work at 
a large-scale conference.

Besides 
re-asserting 
her 

place in the technological 
industry 
after 
years 
of 

invisibility, 
Conway 
has 

also shared her story with 
students at the University.

Charles Cohen, the current 

chief 
technology 
officer 

of 
the 
Cybernet 
Systems 

Corporation in Ann Arbor, 
received his Ph.D. from the 
University in 1996. Conway 
was his dissertation adviser. 

Cohen said working with 

Conway was a life-changing 
experience. Academically, he 
said Conway challenged him 
as a writer and a thinker, but 
she remains his mentor in 
everything from work to dirt 
biking.

“She dirt bikes — I bet you 

didn’t know that about her,” 
Cohen said before laughing. 
“She always lives on the edge 
of everything she does. She 
takes very calculated risks, 
but she certainly takes risks. 

If there’s no chance of failure, 
it’s boring.”

University students are still 

discovering Conway’s story 
today. LSA junior Noah Streng 
said he became fascinated 
with her story when Forbes 
first reported IBM’s apology.

“As 
a 
member 
of 
the 

LGBTQ+ community, it is 
incredibly inspiring to see 
people 
like 
Dr. 
Conway 

overcome so much adversity 
and be such a pioneer for 
social 
change, 
breaking 

barriers for LGBTQ+ people 
everywhere,” Streng said.

Throughout the next 20 

years, more IBM employees 
became 
familiar 
with 

Conway’s story via her website 
and social media presence. In 
particular, Diane Gherson, a 
senior vice president at IBM, 
wrote in an email to The Daily 
that she first heard the story 
this past summer on Conway’s 
wiki page.

“I 
was 
stunned 
and 

heartbroken,” Gherson wrote. 

Two decades after their 

last contact, IBM suddenly 
reached out to Conway again 
to invite her to headline 
a 
public 
company 
event 

on Oct. 14. At the virtual 
event, Conway was officially 
awarded the prestigious IBM 
Lifetime Achievement Award 
which 
signifies 
that 
she 

“changed the world through 
technological inventions.”

After 
celebrating 
her 

technological achievements, 

Gherson, who also hosted the 
event, personally apologized 
to Conway on behalf of the 
company half a century after 
she was fired.

“I wanted to say to you 

here today, Lynn, for that 
experience in our company 
52 years ago and all the 
hardships that followed, I am 
truly sorry,” Gherson said at 
the event.

Gherson 
went 
on 
to 

describe the changes IBM 
has made to their policies for 
LGBTQ+ 
inclusion, 
which 

includes a firm-wide health 
care plan that helps cover 
gender-affirming 
related 

care.

“I’m confident in saying … 

you would have been treated 
quite 
differently 
today,” 

Gherson said to Conway. “But 
all that doesn’t help you, Lynn 
… So, we’re here today not only 
to celebrate you as a world-
renowned innovator and IBM 
alum, but also to learn from 
you, and by doing so, create a 
more inclusive workplace and 
society.” 

Lynn joked to The Daily 

that though she was a “good 
spy” 
— 
alluding 
to 
her 

long history of hiding her 
transgender identity — she 
could not contain the visible 
emotion that came to her face 
when she heard the apology.

“It was done in such an 

obviously 
heartfelt 
and 

authentic way that, at first, 
I was kind of speechless 

because I did not expect an 
apology,” Conway said.

Ella 
Slade, 
the 
global 

LGBT+ 
leader 
at 
IBM, 

attended the Oct. 14 event. In 
an email to The Daily, Slade 
wrote that Conway’s emotion 
was shared by the LGBT+ 
employees watching.

“The IBM trans community 

look up to Lynn and are 
familiar with her story, so this 
moment was truly healing,” 
Slade wrote. “Lynn made a 
comment at one point about 
her joining this IBM event 
was like returning home, and 
it’s hard not to get choked up 
hearing that.” 

The 
apology 
may 
have 

come 52 years after the fact, 
but Conway told The Daily 
she feels this moment in time 
— and now her story — has 
become part of a revolution in 
social acceptance. For her, the 
apology has become a symbol 
of her and IBM recognizing 
their “joint humanity” and 
celebrating how far they both 
have come.

“The thing is, this story 

is not entirely about me, or 
even about IBM,” Conway 
said. “We’re the messengers. 
Our story is a lesson: you can 
never take for granted that 
you really know what you’re 
doing now and how it will 
affect the future. It’s a new 
kind of social awareness.”

APOLOGY
From Page 1

But her goal was always 

to return to Cambodia. After 
receiving 
her 
law 
degree 

from 
the 
University, 
Seng 

returned to her birth country. 
Eventually, 
she 
ended 
up 

working for several years at the 
Center for Social Development, 
a prominent nongovernmental 
organization in Cambodia. 

Public 
Policy 
professor 

John Ciorciari, an expert on 
international law who worked 
on memory and justice efforts 
in Cambodia, praised Seng’s 
advocacy.

“Everyone in the sector 

knows Theary,” Ciorciari said. 
“She’s a very vocal opponent 
of the government, and has 
been courageous in criticizing 
the government even during 
these last several years when 
criticizing 
the 
government 

has been a particularly risky 
proposition.”

Her fight in opposition to 

Cambodia’s government has 
required personal sacrifices. 
Seng decided to never marry 
or have children because any 
“entanglement” 
could 
put 

others at risk.

“I’ve 
always 
been 
open 

unconsciously 
to 
the 

possibility of imprisonment,” 
she said. “I don’t have a 
husband, I don’t have children 
whom they can hurt. I don’t 
have private property that they 

can rip off. So in this regard, 
I’m the most independent, I’m 
the most free person inside the 
country.”

After the summons, Seng 

chose to stay in the country 
when she could have fled to 
the U.S. or elsewhere. She said 
this is what the government 
wanted because if she left, she 
would not be able to return to 
Cambodia.

She called the summons an 

act of insecurity. 

“Why else are they coming 

after a fragile or fragile-
looking 50-year-old woman 
who walks around in heels? 
Me?” Seng asked. “I don’t 
have bodyguards. I don’t have 
security. I only have a dog.”

While activists have been 

targeted for criticizing the 
government, Seng’s status as 
a U.S. citizen makes her case 
unique. 

“I’m not unaware of the 

power of U.S. citizenship and 
I’m using that,” she said. “I will 
use whatever tools I have.”

Seng said the repression of 

activists and those critical of 
the government is a strategy to 
stifle dissent.

“They use physical tools, 

they 
use 
the 
weapons 
of 

violence,” Seng added. “We 
have our own weapons, as 
peacemakers. 
Truth 
is 
its 

own weapon. These are not 
fluffy, 
flowery 
sentiments 

— I really believe this. And 
I really believe in the power 
of solidarity among people 

who love democracy, who love 
freedom of expression.”

Typically, U.S. citizenship 

might 
have 
made 
the 

government hesitate to charge 
an 
activist, 
according 
to 

Ciorciari. 

“It’s not surprising at all that 

activists are getting hauled 
into court by this government,” 
Ciorciari said. “That is their 
strategy, that is how they 
defanged the opposition, is 
to use carrots and sticks, 
primarily 
sticks 
associated 

with 
the 
judicial 
system. 

What is a bit surprising to me 
is that Theary is Cambodian 
American. 
In 
the 
past, 
I 

would have not expected this 
government 
to 
arrest 
and 

charge 
somebody 
who 
has 

American citizenship.”

But the country’s political 

situation and relationship with 
the U.S. has changed in the 
last few years. The Cambodian 
government, which long had a 
tense relationship with the U.S. 
government, decided in 2017 to 
stop giving special treatment or 
protection to people associated 
with the U.S., Ciorciari said. 
They kicked out the National 
Democratic Institute Office in 
Cambodia and shut down The 
Cambodia Daily, an English-
language newspaper that was 
largely run by Americans. 

This 
comes 
as 
China 

asserts growing influence in 
Cambodia, lending money and a 
degree of political installation, 
Ciorciari said. The Trump 

administration’s 
“strongman 

tactics and downplaying of 
the 
human 
rights 
agenda” 

may have also been a factor in 
the government’s decision to 
move against the NDI and The 
Cambodia Daily, he said. 

After Seng decided to stay 

in the country and go to 
court, she put her chances of 
imprisonment at 90%. Now, 
with increasing attention to her 
case, which she thanks Genser 
and other friends for, she puts 
her chances of imprisonment 
at 50%.

Public awareness is, in fact, 

a key strategy for her case. 
Genser has asked the U.S. 
Ambassador to Cambodia to 
attend Seng’s trial with her and 
mobilize support from other 
foreign embassies.

“These 
trials 
are 
often 

held in secret, despite the 
requirements of international 
law to be public and open to 
the public,” he said. “By having 
diplomats from the U.S. and 
from other governments attend 
and try to make their way 
into the tribunal it becomes 
much, much harder for the 
government of Cambodia to 
have the trial be closed … 
(That) can be very, very helpful 
to establishing the arbitrary 
nature of the tension.”

Gesner 
also 
submitted 

an urgent action appeal on 
Monday to the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in 
Cambodia and the UN Special 

Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and 
expression.

Ciorciari 
said 
the 
trials 

of Seng and other dissidents 
should be seen through a 
political lens, instead of a 
juridical one. He urged the U.S. 
government to step in.

“If 
the 
United 
States 

government 
and 
others, 

including 
European 

governments, including non-
state actors, if they don’t 
come to the support of Theary 
and 
other 
activists 
who 

are facing these trials, the 
chances of the people on trial 
for a fair outcome are greatly 
diminished,” he said.

Ciorciari called Seng’s case 

a watershed moment and an 
opportunity for the U.S. to 
prove its commitment to human 
rights instead of engaging in a 
“race to the bottom” on rule of 
law and governance standards 
with China.

“If the U.S. government is not 

willing to stand up and voice 
support in this type of case, 
it’s hard to imagine preserving 
any credibility in the region as 
a defender of democracy and 
human rights,” he said.

Seng has already met with 

the U.S. embassy. Should she 
be imprisoned, they agreed to 
visit once a month and bring 
her toiletries. She still wanted 
to cut her hair just in case.

“I thought of the uncertainty 

of being able to shampoo 

regularly and having lice and 
scabies and all that,” Seng said. 
“So I’m prepared physically, but 
I’m also prepared mentally.”

Her background encouraged 

her to stay and fight, she said, 
despite knowing the regime 
well and what it’s capable of. 
Seng said her friends have been 
gunned down in broad daylight 
by the Hun Sen government. 

She is particularly worried 

that the current conditions of 
the government are similar 
to the conditions prior to the 
Khmer Rouge, which killed 
both her parents.

“I cannot imagine as an 

adult to have Khmer Rouge 
part two,” Seng said. “ … All the 
regional and global actors who 
were responsible to whatever 
degree for the rights of the 
Khmer Rouge are present here. 
I’m not overdramatizing this. 
It’s just stating the urgency and 
the seriousness of the matter 
and 
the 
militarization 
of 

Cambodia. China has so many 
military bases in Cambodia, 
and it’s buying up land across 
the country.”

“So everyone should pay 

attention because Cambodia is 
very fragile, it’s very durable 
and under the influence of 
China right now, that is a 
serious concern,” she said. 
“The conditions of pre-Khmer 
Rouge are here.”

TRIAL
From Page 1

Manufacturers 
would 

typically not produce vaccines 
until it’s approved, because 
what if it’s not approved? 
So what has happened is 
that a great deal of vaccines 
have already been produced 
because the government has 
underwritten the payment for 
the doses. The other parallel 
consequence of the funding 
mechanism 
is 
that 
these 

trials are much larger than 
typically conducted, which 
is why we got the results 
so quickly. The number of 
people who are participating 
relates 
directly 
in 
terms 

of how many failures are 
going to occur. And that’s 
how they figure out when to 
do a preliminary analysis, 
because they have to see a 
certain number of cases. 
The more people who are 
in the trial, the quicker you 
see the number of cases. So 
everything has been done 
to speed the process and 
nothing has been done that 
would affect assessment of 
safety.

TMD: Can you tell me 

a little bit about what the 

timeline for rolling out the 
vaccine will likely look like?

AM: Well, the timeline 

for rolling out the vaccine 
is really less of what I 
am 
involved 
with. 
The 

committee will have a vote 
on whether we think that the 
vaccine should be approved 
on the basis of safety and 
efficacy. The FDA can either 
listen to us or not listen, but 
most of the time they do 
listen. For the Pfizer vaccine, 
we will have our meetings 
about 
that 
on 
December 

10th. On December 17th, it 
will be Moderna that will be 
discussed. The dates of these 
meetings are basically driven 
by the manufacturers. This is 
a public-private partnership 
— things are driven by the 
company submitting its data 
to FDA and that’s how the 
schedule of meetings has 
been determined. We make 
our recommendations, then 
the FDA has to officially 
approve. And this is an 
emergency use authorization, 
not regular licensure, which 
will follow at a later time. 
After 
this, 
the 
Advisory 

Committee on Immunization 
Practices will meet virtually 
and approve a policy for what 
groups should be first in line. 

And this is where Operation 
Warp Speed comes in, but 
that’s where things get to 
be a little more vague in 

terms of how things will be 
handled. 

TMD: What was different 

about this vaccine process? 
What has stayed the same 
about this process?

AM: What is different 

is the telescoping of the 
various events. We’ve gone 
through 
usual 
production 

and laboratory testing of 

vaccines. At the same time, 
it very quickly went into 
humans. Usually, you wait 
for a period of time to do 

phase one and two studies 
and then to get into big trials. 
But all this happened very 
quickly. 

A key thing to bear in mind 

is that first is the emergency 
use authorization and the 
full licensure will require 
six months of follow up. 
However, the efficacy still 
has to be demonstrated for 

folks. There’s no difference 
in 
efficacy 
requirements 

in 
the 
emergency 
use 

authorization, 
it 
just 
is 

quicker. And people should 
realize that there has been 
no compromise in efficacy. 
Efficacy is effectiveness for 
observational studies, where 
you see how the vaccines 
work in the real world. Now, 
what will happen afterward, 
is that everyone will be 
looking 
at 
effectiveness. 

The University is going to 
be involved here — we’ve 
expanded what we usually 
do with the flu to include the 
COVID-19 vaccine. So we will 
be part of a network looking 
to 
see 
how 
the 
various 

vaccines work in terms of 
prevention of disease, and 
also in terms of safety. 

TMD: Why is a vaccine 

so important to ending the 
pandemic?

AM: Well, given the fact 

that 
we 
don’t 
have 
any 

immunity to this novel virus, 
it 
can 
infect 
everybody, 

potentially. 

And therefore, we need to 

have the antibodies in the 
population so that we can 
reduce infection, illness and 
spread.

TMD: What would you 

say to anyone who might be 
hesitant about any vaccine 
that does get approved?

AM: This vaccine will 

have been approved by the 
standard mechanism. By the 
time the vaccine becomes 
available 
to 
the 
general 

population 
it 
will 
have 

standard, 
non-emergency 

approval. And the people 
who would be first in line to 
get it, with emergency-use 
authorization, are at higher 
risk of either developing 
infection or getting more sick 
... if they do get infected. So 
they will probably talk about 
the risk-benefit ratio. The 
risk is we haven’t followed 
the vaccine for as long as 
we typically do. The benefit 
is they don’t get COVID. As 
with anything that you put 
in your body, there’s always 
some degree of risk. We want 
it to be as low as possible, but 
you always have to balance 
the benefits with a small risk.

TMD: 
Any 
final 

comments? 

AM: The proceedings of 

our deliberations are open 
and they will be livestreamed 
on YouTube.

There’s no difference in efficacy

As of November 2020, the Face-

book group Subtle Asian Traits 
has amassed almost two million 
members. Articles in The Atlan-
tic, The New Yorker and The New 
York Times have hailed it as a 
“safe space — where Asian Ameri-
cans can express (their) authentic 
selves.” The group shares memes, 
tweets, funny screenshots, cute 
art and Tiktoks meant to be relat-
able to the Asian diasporic expe-
rience.

In August 2020, Sarah Mae 

Dizon wrote a piece called “Why 
I Hate Subtle Asian Traits” which 
criticized S.A.T. for its elitism — 
the group’s memes and tweets 
largely assume you’ve grown up 
in an affluent home with “expen-
sive academic tutoring and piano 
lessons” — as well as “boba lib-
eralism,” a term first defined by 
Twitter user @diaspora_is_red 
as politically shallow, consum-
erist, surface-level, mainstream 
Asian 
American 
liberalism, 

which is complacenct with the 
bare minimum. It’s “all sugar, no 
substance.” 

But before I’d ever heard the 

term “boba liberalism,” Subtle 
Asian Traits was just annoying 
to me. So many of the memes are, 
predictably, about addictions to 
bubble tea, which I don’t drink; 
K-Dramas and anime, which I 
don’t watch; STEM fields, which, 
frankly, I could never; and unrea-
sonably strict parents, whom I 
didn’t grow up with. It pushes 
largely East and Southeast Asian 
diasporic cultures, and there is 
no representation for specifically 
South Asian voices. S.A.T. pres-
ents a heavily monolithic lifestyle 
for people of Asian descent, one 
which ascribes to the harmful 
model minority myth and pushes 
capitalist consumerism. I have 
to pause and think, “This can’t 
possibly be every person in every 
Asian diasporic community.” If 

so, then that makes me really sad.

Additionally, over six hundred 

thousand people have joined the 
Subtle Asian Traits offshoot, 
Subtle Asian Dating. According 
to Facebook, I myself have been a 
member since November 28, 2018. 
We’re coming up on our two-year 
anniversary. 

As the name would suggest, 

S.A.D. shares insights and funny 
tweets on romantic statuses of 
every kind: swimming in the 
dating pool, remaining (frustrat-
ingly) single and getting happily 
cuffed. Many of the memes strike 
me as sexist; they tease women 
for being absurdly needy and 
moody — at least, way more so 
than all the women I know — or 
poke fun at men simply for being 
shorter than 5’10”.

On Subtle Asian Dating, people 

post “auctions” — they’ll upload 
pictures of their single friends 
and include their personal infor-
mation, like pros and cons lists. 
Some people have gotten creative 
and made PowerPoint videos for 
their pitch. The whole reason 
S.A.D. became an Internet hit 
in the first place was because of 
how insane (and insanely addict-
ing) this concept is. Entreaties 
for “rave baes” or “ABGs/ABBs” 
(or, Asian Baby Girls/Asian Baby 
Boys) are stupid fun to read, but 
they’re also some of S.A.D.’s most 
problematic content.

In the standard auction post, 

names, ages and locations are 
typically followed by an eth-
nicity category which begs the 
question, “Who gets to count as 
Asian American?” Not only that, 
but who gets to feel attractive as 
an Asian American? Auctions for 
those of South Asian descent are 
scant, and rarely do they receive 
the same amount of attention as 
posts for individuals with East 
Asian backgrounds. This exclu-
sion buys into the myth that only 
lighter skinned people qualify as 
“Asian,” at least in the way we ini-
tially think of the word. S.A.D.’s 
name would imply an inclusive, 

safe space for all Asians, but we 
leave so many behind because of 
the colorist attitudes which pol-
lute East and Southeast Asian 
culture. (People of South Asian 
descent have their own Facebook 
group tragically christened, “Sub-
tle Curry Traits.”) Conversely, 
posts fetishize ethnically mixed 
people, especially those who are 
half white; openers that read 
“ATTENTION!! HOT DREAM 
HALFIE [heart eye emoji]” make 
me roll my eyes, because it’s ludi-
crous that the Asian diaspora 
esteems Western beauty stan-
dards so grossly that the dehu-
manizing term “halfie” is now a 
compliment used to pull singles 
in. It’s disturbing, but unsurpris-
ing.

Another 
category 
expected 

from S.A.D. auctions is the indi-
vidual’s educational background. 
Some of the posts that blow up 
include 
gag-inducing, 
“HAR-

VARD MAN !! [brain emoji, heart 
emoji]” lines, or the classic “CS 
major so you know he’ll get that 
bread [several dollar sign emojis, 
two sly face emojis]” which trig-
gers my fight or flight instincts. 
While I applaud anyone who 
works their butt off to get into 
the school of their dreams, this 
prioritization of a top education 
reflects the intellectual snobbery 
(and insecurity) which so many 
Asians struggle with, internalize 
and then project onto others. It 
also implies that where one goes 
to college is a good indicator of 
their intelligence, but this one-
dimensional view fails to take into 
account factors that may limit 
academic performance — such 
as poor mental health or the fis-
cal need for a part-time job — and 
ignores the obvious: that “daddy’s 
money” is inextricably linked to 
wide disparities in educational 
opportunity.

Additionally, 
auctions 
are 

inherently classist. People who 
mention they’re going to make or 
currently make six figures push 
the superficial and ethically dan-

gerous view that relationships 
are 
monetarily 
transactional. 

Those that can will flex fancy 
cars and designer clothes. One 
2019 auction put in its pros cat-
egory, “Drives a Mercedes, wears 
a Gucci belt, rocks a Burberry 
bucket hat, has NOT ONE BUT 
TWO Louis Vuitton wallets [dol-
lar emoji, money bag emoji].” I 
don’t even have anything analyti-
cal to say about that one; it’s just 
an aggressively crappy move.

The authors of these problem-

atic posts shouldn’t be “canceled.” 
We should instead try to fix the 
Facebook group, and by exten-
sion society’s attitudes as a whole; 
after all, individual posters are 
only trying to get their friends or 
themselves more likes by whatev-
er means necessary. People have 
to use their affluence, elite uni-
versities or Eurocentric looks to 
get more clout because they know 
these are what sells with their 
audience.

While posts themselves dis-

play 
surface-level 
composure, 

their comment sections are often 
fraught with objectification and 
cyberbullying. 
Fatphobia 
and 

homophobia are issues which 
have long plagued the Asian com-
munity and they run rampant in 
the rare S.A.D. auction featuring 
a non-heterosexual person or a 
woman whose ribs don’t poke out 
of her stomach. Straight men tag 
each other in gay men’s posts say-
ing “all u bro,” or tell their friends 
to shoot their shot with plus-size 
women as a joke, as if LGBTQ+ 
people or heavier people are any 
less deserving of love. Hilarious.

I could go on and on about all 

the reasons I hate S.A.D. auctions, 
but if I’m being perfectly honest 
with myself, I love reading them. 
They’re just a fun and stupid way 
to pass the time. I am a straight 
woman, but I prefer reading auc-
tions featuring other straight 
women to those which advertise 
men. And, good God.

These women are Stanford 

students, K-Pop trainees turned 

Google interns who’ve done “a 
little modeling work on the side.” 
They sport Gucci and Louis Vuit-
ton with indifferent noncha-
lance, like they’re free tote bags 
from The New Yorker. They do 
humanitarian work in Haiti. They 
have the discipline to work out 
religiously, and, as a result, their 
bodies make me want to walk into 
the ocean. 

These women are, in short, 

accomplished and hot. They have 
brains and beauty and resolve. 
They are sexy Amazonian war-
rior princess goddesses.

I, on the other hand, love eat-

ing carbs just as much as I hate 
working out, which is saying a lot. 
I have turned twenty-percent-of-
my-final-grade assignments in 
one minute before the deadline 
and I get ghosted by most of the 
internships I apply to. I don’t have 
many friends and even before the 
pandemic, I’d spend my weekends 
indoors watching “30 Rock” alone 
and wolfing down spicy Cheez-Its 
so ceaselessly you would think 
a kidnapper had threatened to 
shoot me if I didn’t down a bag 
in under thirty minutes. I am not 
pining for compliments or beg-
ging to be “picked” because I’m 
“not like other girls.” I’m not try-
ing to be some quirky main char-
acter played by Zooey Deschanel 
in a movie when I say that, truly, 
from the bottom of my heart — I 
do not have my **** together.

It’s not endearing. It’s not cute. 

I have spent my entire young 
adult life reprimanding myself for 
not doing or being enough; I never 
joined enough student organiza-
tions, I never picked up enough 
skills, I never lost enough weight. 
The amazing women who get 
auctioned off on S.A.D. and amass 
thousands of likes make me feel 
terrible about myself. I need the 
constant reminder that, in reality, 
and especially now during a pan-
demic, it is perfectly okay to sim-
ply make it through a few months 
without losing my sanity. I don’t 
need to be doing the most in 2020.

I used to pore over S.A.D. auc-

tions with obsessive intrigue and 
scrutiny, like I was staring at a 
messy pile-up on I-94. I did it to 
hurt myself, to berate myself for 
not being as successful or as rich 
or as skinny or as pretty or as 
smart as others. If they could do 
it, then why couldn’t I? I put the 
internalized male gaze society 
has ingrained in me for nineteen 
years to good work by speculat-
ing how many likes I would get 
if I were to put myself out there. 
The answer made me hate myself 
even more.

Even as members of the globally 

widespread Asian diaspora, many 
of us second generation Asians 
have 
subconsciously 
gleaned 

cultural expectations for rela-
tionships from our parents’ gen-
eration. Consequently, we want 
light-skinned, financially stable 
partners with banging bodies 
and doe-eyed, Western looks. 
But Subtle Asian Dating, as I’m 
often prone to forget, is nothing 
serious. Despite the occasional 
“S.A.D. success story,” you are not 
going to meet your soulmate at an 
online auction. (Hopefully) every-
one can acknowledge that S.A.D. 
is a vain and superficial endeavor; 
in other words, it’s just not that 
deep, bro.

Subtle Asian Dating is a some-

what problematic — yet very 
entertaining — online community 
which I actively participate in. 
The few times I’ve thought about 
leaving the group, I ultimately 
decided to stay and continue 
consuming S.A.D. content. It’s 
such a guilty pleasure, but when 
my friend tags me in a depress-
ing meme about being single or 
an auction for a particularly fine 
beefcake of a man, I want to inter-
act with it. I “sad” or “heart” react 
and reply to my friends, because, 
though it’s not completely harm-
less, the unabashedly shallow 
spectacle and the sense of com-
munity are fun. Maybe that’s why 
I probably won’t be leaving this 
toxic relationship any time soon.

This past Thanksgiving break, 

I sat down to watch the critically 
acclaimed “Wolf of Wall Street”, 
dubbed one of the best movies of 
all time. Being my first year in the 
business school, this film seemed 
to be a prerequisite for the unof-
ficial BBA checklist. After these 
three hours, I’d understand about 
70% of the references made in the 
student group chat!

So I sat. I sat and watched. And 

within those three hours, the 
abhorrent sexism was physically 
nauseating — I probably had to 
pause and regroup almost twen-
ty times (and I wasn’t the only 
one). The absurdity depicted was 
expected — it is a “satire” (glorifi-
cation? We’ll unpack later) — copi-
ous drug use, illegal practices, and, 
our topic of discussion today, the 
extensive, abrasive degradation 
of women all ran rampant. Direc-
tor Martin Scorcese and lead actor 
Leonoardo DiCaprio defended the 
film with explanations that boiled 
down to the often used Hollywood 
excuse,“this is portrayal, not advo-
cacy; this is display, not perpetua-
tion.”

Women have been subject to 

accepting the objectification of 
their bodies so much so that, at this 
point, it’s not even a prevalent cri-
tique of acclaimed films. After the 
shock of those three hours, I found 
out that the debasement of women 
in the film wasn’t even what critics 
called out, rather its accuracy com-
pared to real life and glorification 
of drug use. Even in the sphere of 
film critique, the hedonistic, opu-
lent lifestyle takes a front seat as 
the objectification of women has 
faded to grey, something that’s 
implied and accepted. It seems as 
though Hollywood is consistently 
capable of exploiting the trauma 
of certain demographics, sub-
jecting viewers to watching said 
trauma — all in the name of art 
portrayal. Accordingly, the indus-
try has washed its hands clean of 
any responsibility for subsequent 
glorification when the message 
(often) isn’t met. I’ve heard people 
talk about striving for that “Jordan 
Belfort lifestyle” more than I’ve 
heard them talk about the grandi-
ose destructive patterns of Jordan 
Belfort (this unsurprisingly mir-
rors how the film visually glorified 

his lifestyle, ignoring the very real 
harm he caused to everyday Amer-
icans). 

Is it all in the eye of the behold-

er? Should the viewer be held liable 
for not getting “the message’? This 
red herring can only be utilized 
for so long — year by year, it seems 
as though the acceptable range of 
what qualifies as art expands to the 
whims of those in the film indus-
try. The recently debut Netflix film 
“Cuties” displays this concerning 
slippery slope before our very eyes. 
Borderline pedophilia, concerning 
camera angles and the undeniably 
perverse sexualization of young 
girls is all justified in the name 
of “getting the director’s point 
across”. That point hitting home? 
Unlikely. The proliferation of child 
objectification? Its visibility and 
concurrent advanced normalcy? 
Certain. Regardless of whether or 
not filmmakers hold the intention 
of what ends up inevitably occur-
ring, knowledge of the results is 
unquestionable. Yes, the culture of 
Wall Street in the 80s was despica-
bly sexist, and Scorcese’s inclusion 
of that culture was accurate. How-
ever, as bearer of that harsh reality, 
“Wolf” surrendered to it. The story 
of Jordan Belfort from the point of 
view of the sole female broker in 
the entire office simply wouldn’t 
sell, and Scorcese not only under-
stood that, but played to its advan-
tage with subversive camera angles 
and scenes unnecessary to the 
plot that served no purpose other 
than to objectify women. “Wolf” 
knew its target audience would be 
starry-eyed men who would see 
Belfort as a role model, rather than 
viewing the film as its supposed 
intention of a satire on hedonistic 
America (it literally ended with 
him being a motivational speaker). 
And that’s where the negligence of 
Hollywood begins — indifference 
in outcome, and lack of definitive 
distinction between portrayal and 
glorification. 

It’s a tragedy that women have 

become conditioned to witness 
their objectification on screen — 
unrelentlessly, unprovokedly and 
insensitively. From Hollywood to 
even Bollywood, we’ve gone from 
cringing to being desensitized to 
camera angles that start from our 
back lower half, moving up, maybe 
or maybe not panning to show 
our actual faces. We’ve gone from 
questioning to finishing the oft-
used line of “we’ll get lots of booze 

and lots of girls to celebrate,” like 
women are party favors rather 
than human beings. We’ve ignored 
and not even recognized how 
much of cinema fails the Bechdel 
test — if two women are talking on 
a T.V. show, odds are it’ll be about 
a man. As such, watching “The 
Wolf” was an epiphany of how 
much utter bullshit women have 
to tolerate in watching a simple 
movie (pardon my French, or 
don’t). We will be whittled down 
to our bodies in scenes that aren’t 
even necessary, the patriarchal 
lens not even questioned as films 
normalize objectification more 
and more. Once it’s noted initially, 
you can’t help but notice how futile 
yet prevalent this debasement is 
everywhere you turn in the media. 
Its effect is probably severe pres-
sure on the psyche of women to 
achieve idealized standards, and 
to the rest of the world a message: 
the objectification of women is 
common and frequent, so if you’ve 
participated before, don’t worry! 
You may continue. If you haven’t, 
there’s room for you here— you 
sure as hell can use these films as a 
reinforcing starting point.

It’s undeniable that mainstream 

Hollywood revels in the male 
gaze. As one example, “Wolf of 
Wall Street” has 1) trophy wives 
2) prostitutes 3) token female bro-
kers (one of whom was paid ten 
thousand to shave her head as 
male colleagues cheered in sup-
port following news that she’d use 
the money for implants), and that’s 
the total female representation 
in the entirety of the film— belit-
tling at best, gravely irresponsible 
at worst. Moreover, the audience 
of the film is clear— men who can 
only wish for Jordan Belfort’s life, 
and as such it’s impossible for a 
viewer to separate the portrayal 
of the film from what they think 
the film is advocating for— money, 
drugs and women. 

Tarantino, Scorscese and sever-

al other preeminent directors are 
pioneers in normalizing male gaze 
and its casual sexism, and as female 
viewers, we oftentimes have to 
make the decision to ignore that 
blatant disrespect when watching 
acclaimed movies. It’s also undeni-
able that Hollywood holds a preda-
tory gaze as well, and the excuse 
of artistry for child exploitation 
is only more troubling following 
recent exposures of criminal traf-
ficker Jeffrey Epstein’s deep con-

nections and sway in the industry. 
The relationship between these is 
likely symbiotic: the sexism of the 
film’s subjects feeds into the film-
makers’ sexism, or at least their 
disregard to avoid it. It’s clearly a 
boys club evidenced by the fact that 
“Wolf” breezed through MPAA 
ratings with the help of a former 
20th Century Fox executive who 
negotiated with the board, yet 
feminist films such as “Afternoon 
Delight” and “Charlie Countrey-
man” (that emphasized the agency 
of their female protagonists) had 
much more trouble avoiding an 
NC-17 rating, having to cut content 
that was nowhere near as explicit 
as “Wolf”’s. 

Alfred Hitchcock said that 

while watching a “well-made 
film, we don’t sit by as specta-
tors, we participate.” Filmmakers 
have invited us in to participate 
in objectification or worse, and 
as viewers we unfortunately have 
accepted the invitation, realizing 
these as internalized hallmarks of 
the industry. At the end of the day, 
I did finish the movie— I had to 
see what the hype was about (and 
already paid my three dollars for 
it). Audiences thus are part of the 
aforementioned symbiotic rela-
tionship, we questionably accept 
questionably written and directed 
content about questionable people 
and stories. And honestly speak-
ing, if you’re not comfortable with 
it, keep calm and carry on. But if 
you are, you’re not the only one. 
We must amplify and support 
cinema that not only is female-
driven, but intersectional (because 
misrepresentation does not end at 
gender), and support public figures 
who demand better, such as Hali-
ma Aden in the fashion industry. 
Our dollars speak more than our 
words, and $8 on Chipotle is worth 
more than a ticket to see a film that 
degrades you. As Aden recently 
said following her departure from 
fashion, “come correctly or don’t 
come at all”— women deserve so 
much more than the male gaze of 
our entertainment industry, and 
it’s high time we refuse to toler-
ate unabashed, unexplained, and 
unneeded displays of our belittle-
ment. Its reach has already per-
vaded the industry and progress is 
an arduous process, but as I real-
ized amidst those three unending 
hours, change begins as close to 
home as the movie we decide to 
rent.

Display vs. participation: Hollywood says, ‘Por que no los dos!’

The S.A.D. Truth: Why I hate (and love to hate) Subtle Asian Dating

Everyone 
should 
learn 
a 

second language. Yes, it looks 
great on resumes and it’s a nice 
fun-fact to pitch about your-
self for an icebreaker. Perhaps 
it is harder for native English 
speakers to recognize this, but 
English does not encompass a 
lot of artistic or poetic words 
that many other languages 
offer. Learning another tongue 
if you speak only English will 
open the doors to an entirely 
new world. You can speak about 
things you were never able to 
before, understand things in 
a way you are currently not 
familiar with; your perspective 
about everything can change. 

Using another language adds 

an entirely different feel to your 
conversation. Many other lan-
guages incorporate formality 
into their dialect, which is one 
of the many aspects of intri-
cacy English lacks. In French, 
if you are speaking to someone 
older or in a professional set-
ting, you use “vous” to address 
them. When speaking to some-
one your age, or someone you 
are close with, you use “tu” to 
address them. This is just one 
way of how using a different 
language changes your entire 
feel to communication: The 
closeness you feel when refer-
ring to someone using “tu” for 
the first time is something the 
English language cannot match. 
It’s a small burst of happiness, 
something you would never 
have the opportunity to feel 
if you stay within the realm of 
only one tongue.

Many other languages incor-

porate a lot of indirect, poetic 
everyday phrases that, when 
you truly understand the lan-
guage you are learning, can 
begin to change the way you 
look at the world around you. 
For instance, Urdu is a mix of 
Persian, Turkish and Arabic, 
and so it borrows many phrases 
from each contributor. Urdu 
is also the official language of 
Pakistan, and so Islamic phras-
es are also commonly used in 
everyday speech. For instance, 
if someone does something as 
simple as give you a glass of 
water, the appropriate response 

is not normally “thank you.” It 
is either “Jazakallah,” which 
in Arabic roughly translates 
to “May God reward you with 
goodness,” or when coming 
from an adult, is usually a small 
statement of a wish. When I 
give a glass of water to my dad, 
his response is “May God keep 
you happy for the rest of your 
life,” which, in comparison to 
English’s simple “thank you” 
adds a sense of connection, 
a poetic nature that adds so 
much beauty in every conver-
sational exchange. Sometimes, 
it isn’t even about what you say 
but rather about the absence 
of what you are not saying. In 
Urdu, nobody says “I love you” 
on a casual basis. The words 
used for “love” are weight-
ful and intense. When you say 
goodbye to a friend in English, 
it isn’t weird to casually throw a 
“love ya!” but that kind of casu-
alness doesn’t exist, not just in 
Urdu but in many other Asian 
languages, like Chinese, as well. 
It’s common only to say certain 
emotional phrases in the more 
extreme circumstances — so 
when it is said, it means a world 
more than when it is said in just 
English alone. 

Languages have a powerful 

ability to tune your mindset. In 
Japanese, the “wabisabi” per-
spective is all about accepting 
imperfections 
and 
admiring 

the beauty in imperfect things. 
For instance, some artists pur-
posefully leave cracks in pot-
tery. Many mend broken objects 
with gold, a process called 
“Kintsugi,” which is a tangible 
manifestation of perseverance, 
symbolizing the beauty and 
usefulness of breaks and flaws. 
This kind of prevalence encour-
ages the positive mindset of 
accepting imperfections and 
learning how to find attraction 
in it. 

Other languages have so 

much more to offer than just 
English. Learning another lan-
guage adds intricacy in every-
day, common actions that help 
you appreciate the beauty in 
the ordinary, in commonplace 
things and mundane activities. 
Learning a language is no doubt 
difficult and time-consuming; 
but it is, at the end of the day, a 
small price to pay in exchange 
for a brand new perspective.

7-Opinion

I am a sorority girl, but not in 

the way they are typically por-
trayed: skinny, blonde and white. 
I am none of those, yet I am still 
in a sorority. This type of sorority 
often gets lost in the great umbrel-
la of Fraternity and Sorority Life; 
I myself didn’t realize a space like 
this existed until later into my 
freshman year, eventually joining 
during the first semester of my 
sophomore year.

 
South Asian Fraternity 

and Sorority Life has been around 
since the late twentieth century. 
Spanning multiple fraternities and 
sororities all across the country, 
this community is niche in that 
you usually don’t know about it 
until you stumble across it. In this 
sense, I truly believe that South 
Asian sorority life has gone under-
appreciated, particularly on our 
campus.

 
Dec. 7, 2020 will mark 

one year since I crossed into 
Sigma Sigma Rho Sorority, Inc., a 

South Asian values-based soror-
ity founded on the principles of 
Sisterhood, Society and Remem-
brance and committed to its 
national philanthropy of Domestic 
Violence Awareness and Preven-
tion. As I get closer and closer to 
my first “Sigmaversary,” I’ve been 
reflecting on just how integral 
this organization has been to my 
college life in such a short span 
of time. Organizations like ours 
that are a part of the Multicultural 
Greek Council are rooted in tradi-
tion, yet innovative and evolving 
with the times. We commit our-
selves to our philanthropy and 
service initiatives, and present a 
united front to represent not just 
our organization but our cultural 
values in the context of an ever-
changing world.

 
Joining Sigma Sigma 

Rho pushed me to my limits. It has 
challenged me in ways my other 
organizations have not, and the 
rewards have been like no other. 
As a solo (the only member of my 
class), I’ve gained a newfound 
appreciation for my ability to inde-
pendently tackle challenges and 

follow through with my commit-
ments. Joining this organization 
instilled in me the values of dedi-
cation and loyalty not only to the 
sisterhood but to myself as well.

 My journey throughout the 

past year, though significantly 
impacted by the pandemic, has 
been rewarding nonetheless. In 
January, I had my new member 
presentation, which is one’s official 
reveal to the rest of the communi-
ty. That day, I displayed the skills 
I had learned throughout the past 
semester and showed the commu-
nity that I truly did earn my let-
ters. A new member presentation 
involves the new class standing at 
the front of a room with their faces 
masked, presenting the history of 
their organization and greeting 
the other organizations that are 
present. At the end, the members’ 
identities are revealed to the audi-
ence, cementing their place in the 
multicultural Greek community. 
This meant that I, a person who’s 
always shied away from any form 
of public speaking, stood alone 
in front of around seventy people 
and spoke from memory for about 

half an hour. The event culmi-
nated in my Big unmasking me, 
thus “revealing” me as the newest 
member of the sorority. I moved 
through this entire evening on a 
rush of adrenaline, knowing that 
I was doing something completely 
out of my comfort zone but still 
enjoying it, even excelling at it. 

From that day on, I’ve found 

a home within my chapter that 
has been full of nothing but love, 
acceptance 
and 
growth. 
I’ve 

learned that having a sister means 
more than being tied by blood; a 
true sister is one who is loyal yet 
leaves room for growth, someone 
who has your best interests at 
heart and shares both your joys 
and your struggles. Having this 
sisterhood has been the greatest 
motivation for me in the past year 
to aim high and make my visions 
become reality. I spend a lot of time 
dreaming about what I want to do, 
but that dreaming often comes 
with the feeling that maybe I can’t 
accomplish everything I want. 
Throughout the past year, vari-
ous opportunities have popped up 
that piqued my interest, including 
writing for Michigan in Color. In 
the face of all of the talent I saw 
around me, I sometimes felt like 

maybe I wouldn’t be good enough 
to share that same platform. My 
sisters are also some of my closest 
friends, and sharing these wor-
ries led to meaningful words of 
encouragement to remind me that 
I have tangible skills to contribute 
anywhere I want. Interactions like 
these have been the extra push 
I need to pursue opportunities, 
eventually boosting my own belief 
in myself. 

 
On a campus where 

South 
Asian 
student 
life 
is 

extremely vibrant, consisting of 
multiple types of dance teams 
and social organizations, find-
ing Sigma Sigma Rho was like 
unearthing a hidden gem. I 
thought I had everything I wanted 
in my other organizations; I found 
friends and leadership opportuni-
ties, so I thought I was set. Adding 
a sorority onto my already precari-
ously high list of commitments 
hardly ever crossed my mind. 
However, meeting the sisters of 
SSR made me realize that one 
thing I was lacking, something 
that I had overlooked throughout 
my freshman year, was a constant 
stream of unconditional love and 
support from a group of resil-
ient women. I needed that set of 

females constantly pushing me to 
be the best I could be and remind-
ing me just how much I am capa-
ble of to truly start believing that 
myself.

 
Fraternity and Sorority 

Life has always had an interesting 
reputation throughout the coun-
try. I came into college adamantly 
against any form of it, but that was 
before I understood that a soror-
ity can be more than just parties 
and drama. Meeting some of the 
sisters instilled in me a desire to 
be a part of this organization and 
have these people in my corner. 
When you find the right group of 
people who lift you up and become 
your family on campus, you finally 
have the space to explore your 
own definition of what it means 
to be a strong woman and begin 
growing into that. Finding my 
Distinguished Sisterhood was the 
defining moment of my first half 
of college. As I reach my one year 
milestone as a sister, I’m apprecia-
tive of the growth and confidence 
I’ve gained as a result of my expe-
riences. My greatest hope is that 
this organization continues to 
thrive across the nation as one that 
is redefining what society knows a 
sorority to be.

On Nov. 20, the president-elect 

of the United States asked the 
American people for spare change.

Over half a million people in 

this country experience homeless-
ness. The national consumer debt 
has reached $13.86 trillion. Last 
year, 35.2 million people lived in 
food-insecure households. 32.8 
million Americans under the age 
of 65 do not have health insurance, 
and that does not even include 
folks that are underinsured. But 
Joe Biden is asking us for more 
money. 

The audacity of politicians 

asking the people they represent 
for money isn’t new. They raise 
money for campaigns, in the name 
of ‘fighting’ Trump, to ‘defend’ 
the election and more ambiguous 
efforts. On the other hand, when 
thousands of Americans lost their 
jobs due to the COVID-19 pan-
demic, only some of us were lucky 
enough to receive a $1200 check 
and the chance to apply for unem-
ployment benefits. This left many 
Americans struggling more than 

they ever had. And while I’m not 
saying that is a single politician’s 
fault (because the entire political 
and economic system of the Unit-
ed States has failed us), the inabil-
ity of Joe Biden, Donald Trump 
and their teams to read the room 
is astonishing.

Up until Oct. 22, both Joe Biden 

and Donald Trump’s campaigns 
have raised over $1.5 billion. Over 
$3 billion could have helped mil-
lions of people struggling around 
the country, especially during this 
pandemic that has affected us so 
intensely. Throughout past Repub-
lican and Democratic administra-
tions, the lack of financial stability 
of citizens has resulted in the loss 
of housing, transportation, health 
care, food, water and many more 
essentials. History shows us that 
one change in an administration 
does not result in resources over-
night, which is why giving money 
and supplies directly to those in 
need makes the biggest difference. 

Yet, the custom of giving poli-

ticians more money and power 
instead of providing community 
members with basic items is sup-
ported by many politically vocal 
people. On Nov. 12, Mark Cuban, 

a billionaire and judge on the real-
ity television show Shark Tank 
tweeted that folks should direct 
their money to community mem-
bers instead of political races.

This prompted responses from 

many Democrats, as the Georgia 
run-off election would help create 
a Democratic majority in the Sen-
ate. Those who responded claimed 
that winning the Senate would be 
more help than directly aiding 
under-resourced folks. Among 
the responders, John Legend, 
award-winning artist and self-
proclaimed activist summed up 
what most were saying.

While this is a simplistic way of 

thinking about the way the world 
works, no, John Legend. Politi-
cians do not help the people more 
than the people help themselves.

Politics are not simply “annoy-

ing”; they are often violent and 
destructive 
to 
no/low-income 

Black and Brown folks that they 
claim to be representing. There is 
no way to completely end home-
lessness, end food insecurity, end 
debt and so on without completely 
altering the way the government 
runs, which thrives on capital-
ism. Therefore, the best way to 

help people in need right now is to 
actually help them.

That means donating to small, 

local mutual aid funds and dis-
placement shelters. Spending your 
free time walking through neigh-
borhoods and delivering fresh 
food and water to folks. Setting up 
handwashing stations and passing 

out hand sanitizer and masks dur-
ing a global pandemic.

We’ve had Democrats and 

Republicans in leadership giving 
us less than the bare minimum 
while they allow landlords to raise 
rents and evict families and multi-
billion dollar industries to exploit 
people’s labor for minimum wage. 

As the iconic Black poet, Gil Scott-
Heron, says in his performance of 
“Whitey on the Moon,” a white 
man’s 
achievements, 
whether 

they be making it to the moon or 
the White House, does not change 
anything for Black people. The 
only real change comes from our-
selves.

My friend Grace was the first 

person to ever make me a playl-
ist. She sent me a painstakingly 
crafted 16 track ensemble full of 
SZA, Kendrick Lamar, Outkast, 
Amy Winehouse and Ariana 
Grande among others. It took her 
days to complete, and I still con-
tinue to listen to in its entirety 
years later. What truly makes 
receiving a playlist like Grace’s 
such an honor is that whoever 
makes it for you assembles every 
song with bits and pieces of your 
very being in mind. Like the fact 
that you prefer Cherry Cola over 
any other fountain drink, or that 
you bunny ear your shoelaces 
when tying them, or that cilan-
tro on your tongue tastes like 
soap, or that you wholeheartedly 
believe that The Atlantic is sig-
nificantly better than The New 
Yorker when it comes to the rat 
race that is the literary magazine 
industry. But more so, music is an 
extension of the soul, it’s every 
dream, ambition and fear and by 
that virtue sharing music comes 
to present itself as the most 
sacred form of friendship. In the 
midst of a pandemic and an age 
in which everything has increas-
ingly gone virtual, the sharing 
of music has asserted itself as an 
even more profound way of ini-
tiating and maintaining friend-
ships. 

For the first few weeks of the 

semester, I had become accus-
tomed to the sweaty palms, heart 
thumping, heavy stomach sort 
of sickly feeling that comes with 
the introduction of the dreaded 
breakout room. And while there 
are many things I have come 

to hate about them, more than 
anything else, I hate the lack of 
human and personal connec-
tion, the black screens, the large 
swaths of awkward silence punc-
tuated by sighs and wait-what-
are-we-supposed-to-dos. 
In 
a 

breakout room I was unable to 
read a person’s body language, 
unable to see how they grip their 
pencil or whether they tilt their 
chins up or down, and to observe 
the tiniest of details that ulti-
mately allowed me to tailor our 
communication into a meaning-
ful one, and most importantly 
served for efficient and stream-
lined group work. With the 
advent of online interpersonal 
communication, I found that my 
social skills had reduced to that 
of, dare I say, my middle school 
self. My jokes flopped, either fol-
lowed by forced laughs or none at 
all. Failed attempts at relatability 
with my peers left me question-
ing whether I was really that 
unlikeable. After a lengthy pro-
cess of trial and error, I learned 
that the greatest weapon of all, in 
the battleground of discomfort 
that is the modern day breakout 
room, was meaningful conver-
sation. Much more deeply, con-
versation that didn’t surround 
intended majors or future plans 
or hometowns, but rather, music. 
I found that people loved to talk 
about themselves, particularly 
the more nuanced parts. In a vir-
tual setting that has only exac-
erbated the need to satisfy every 
facet of the human condition 
and more inherently, the essen-
tial need to be perceived and 
understood, opening the floor 
to dialogue about something as 
intimate as the music one listens 
to, became the ultimate antidote 
to breakout room dysphoria. 

Perhaps the most gratifying vic-
tory of all besides completing our 
assigned class work, was coaxing 
a peer out of black-screen-name-
display-only-mic-off anonymity 
as they raved about the hidden 
genius of Kanye West, or 
even watching their thumbnail 
sized zoom box swell with sort 
of prideful acknowledgement as 
I furiously scribbled down the 
songs they told me I absolutely 
had to listen to. And I listened to 
every single one, some of which 
I’ve played on repeat until their 
novelty wore off into absolute 
sickening oblivion. 

More so, my short time at 

The Michigan Daily has been 
particularly gratifying. I am 
unaccustomed to being a part of 
something bigger than myself, 
and yet I find it pleasantly enjoy-
able. I appreciate the literary lib-
eration afforded to me here and 
for the very first time in a long 
time, I feel as if the words I write 
have been bestowed a special sort 
of weight. Regardless, not being 
physically present in the news-
room, or personally meeting my 

editors and fellow columnists 
presents a disorienting chal-
lenge. In particular, though my 
editors engage in the extremely 
inward and intimate process of 
reading my work, I’ve realized 
that I know next to nothing about 
them. With the emergence of a 
shared Michigan in Color playlist 
amongst the staff, I found it was 
more of an opportunity to learn 
about them all as human beings 
that lead very complex lives. I 
could glean bits and pieces of 
their temperaments and charac-
ters from the songs they chose 
to add, like how my editor Devak 
had the most varied and out of 
bounds music taste of all, or that 
while Maya had only contrib-
uted three songs, they were tear 
wrenching and mighty in their 
own right. And most important-
ly, the beautiful and delightful 
realization that my music taste 
was shared with some of the 
most eclectic and dynamic peo-
ple I had ever had the privilege of 
meeting. It should be noted that 
they have excellent music tastes 
by the way. 

We’re doing the most. Even 

in the midst of a deadly global 
pandemic and turbulent civil 
unrest, we are still doing the 
most … if not more than we 
were doing before any of this 
started. Our current reality 
is one characterized by Zoom 
fatigue, news and social media 
overload, financial stress and 
social isolation. Yet during 
these 
extremely 
exhausting 

times, almost none of us are 
getting the rest we truly need. 

This reluctance to rest isn’t 

new. “Grinding” aka this obses-
sion with working ourselves to 
death has been a characteris-
tic of American culture since 
its conception. At an academic 
level, we glorify not getting 
enough sleep at night, taking 
more credits than we can han-
dle, and putting way too many 
extracurricular commitments 
on our plate in order to stay 
“booked and busy.” 

If being busy is a flex, no 

wonder we all feel so weak. 
If we’re always “working to 
death,” when will we get a 
chance to enjoy our life? If 
we’re always “on the grind,” 
when do we get to get off?

The toxic effects of grind-

and-hustle culture are further 
exacerbated by racial injustice, 
especially in this time where 
conversations on race are in 
the spotlight. For Black stu-
dents, beyond the academic, 
occupational, extra-curricular 
duties we have, there’s often 
the expectation that we take 
place in a higher civic duty. 
Especially in these turbulent 
times Black students often 
feel pressured to overextend 
themselves, 
exerting 
extra 

emotional labor time advocat-
ing for social causes, speaking 

about their injustice, and doing 
“the work” on top of everything 
else. 

With all these exhausting 

endeavors, many Black activists 
are recognizing sleep depriva-
tion as a racial justice issue, 
and calling for a divestment in 
grind culture. In other words, 
we need to stop grinding. Black 
community activist and healer, 
Tricia Hersey talks often about 
how we’ve ingrained in our-
selves a machine-like sense of 
constantly working, much like 
robots as a result of a grind cul-
ture that very much literally 
treats humans as machines. In 
a Q&A with her and Black Lives 
Matter 
co-founder 
Patrisse 

Cullors, she details the ways 
in which capitalism and colo-
nization have influenced our 
rest, discusses the necessity for 
“rest as resistance,” and identi-
fies the relationship between 
rest and abolition.

In order for us to solve the 

problems of today, we have to 
be able to be the best versions 
of ourselves. We have to take 
the time to rest … to recover … 
to recoup … to relax. 

When we divest from grind 

culture, we also divest from 
the beck-and-call of consumer 
culture that drives us to place 
profit over people.

We 
divest 
from 
white 

supremacist culture that plots 
to over-work, over-extend and 
over-bear people of color rob-
bing them of their right to rest. 

We divest from the individ-

ualist, self-centered mindset 
that drives competition and 
capital gain and prohibits us 
from recognizing the humanity 
in others.

More importantly, we invest 

in a healthier version of our-
selves that is centered around 
joy, restoration and healing. 
Most importantly, we get the 
most out of doing the least.

BOOK REVIEW

MUSIC REVIEW

Daily Arts on ‘Shuggie Bain’ and the Booker shortlist

Kali Uchis shines on debut Latin album ‘Sin Miedo’

WINNER: Douglas Stuart, ‘Shuggie 

Bain’

“Shuggie Bain” is a novel that is quick 

to overwhelm the reader with its vivid 
and frequent depictions of tragedy, 
though in an unsustainable fashion. The 
reader immediately becomes emotionally 
invested in the broken family dynamics of 
alcoholic mother Agnes and her young son 
Shuggie Bain. However, just as Agnes’s 
processing of events is numbed by her 
incessant drinking and Shuggie’s by a 
childlike lack of understanding, the reader 
must, too, prevent themselves from being 
vulnerable and taking in the full force of 
the family’s misfortunes. Stuart does not 
give the reader a chance to come up for 
air between each chapter’s perils, so they 
have no choice but to distance themselves 
from each emotionally taxing misstep that 
they vicariously live through.

Perhaps if the committee selecting 

the Booker Prize winner is particularly 
mentally strong and willing to undergo 
the struggles Agnes and Shuggie face 
without shielding their eyes in the process, 
they will find “Shuggie Bain” moving and 
worthy of the prize. But if their reading of 
the novel resembles mine, then Stuart’s 
relentless 
creation 
of 
traumatizing 

obstacles for its protagonists will leave 
them needing a break rather than giving 
praise.

OUR WINNER: Diane Cook, ‘The 

New Wilderness’

Diane Cook’s “The New Wilderness” is 

a beautiful tale of survival, motherhood 
and human nature that has a fighting 
chance of winning this year’s Booker 
Prize. The novel explores a dystopian 
reality where the overcrowded City can 
no longer sustain its inhabitants and only 
a lucky few are able to escape by joining a 
survival study in the Wilderness State. 

Cook masterfully examines group 

dynamics, mother-daughter relationships 
and power struggles in her debut novel. 
“The New Wilderness” feels both timely 
and timeless, warning of the effects 
of overcrowding and pollution while 
exploring classic themes of man in nature 
and the subtleties of human interaction. 
For a beautifully written, well-researched 
and utterly engrossing novel, author Diane 
Cook deserves the 2020 Booker Prize.

Tsitsi 
Dangarembga, 
‘This 

Mournable Body’

Seen as a staple author in contemporary 

literature, Tsitsi Dangarembga is widely 
known for her 1988 novel “Nervous 
Conditions.” The novel functions as 
the first installment in the trilogy that 
“This Mournable Body,” this year’s 
2020 nominee, bookends. To say that 
Dangarembga is an unskilled writer or 
undeserving of celebration would be in 
bad faith — the writer-activist has written 
groundbreaking works and was recently 
arrested while bravely protesting against 
Zimbabwe’s autocratic crack-down. 

Admittedly, I read this book as a 

standalone from the remainder of the 
trilogy (as it was nominated for the Booker 
Prize). Still, “This Mournable Body” 

feels immensely weak against the rest of 
Dangarembga’s profile. 

Centered on the character of previous 

novels, Tambudzai, “This Mournable 
Body” dissects issues of war trauma, 
gender and a feeling of hopelessness that 
pervades both the novel’s characters 
and setting. Yet, the writing of the novel 
feels both probable and uninspiring. 
Dangarembga flits nonchalantly through 
imprecise metaphors (of hyenas, vines) 
and disposable characters, wrapping the 
book in a sense of confusion. Moments of 
tangible action, which should lock down 
readers’ attention for at least a page, feel 
distantly abstract. Even the moments that 
reveal the greatness of Dangarembga’s 
intentions — the profundity of her message 
that is most visible when one recounts the 
novel’s plot as a whole — feel diluted. Easy 
to speed read, “This Mournable Body” 
is a nominee that seems too safe and too 
unremarkable for the 2020 Booker Prize.

— John Decker, Managing Arts Editor

Maaza Mengiste, ‘The Shadow King’
We at the Daily have placed our bets 

behind Mengiste’s newest novel, “The 
Shadow King’” to win this year’s Booker 
Prize. Covering a lightly fictionalized 
Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Mengiste 
documents 
Mussolini’s 
invasion 
of 

Ethiopia and the people’s resistance. She 
includes multiple perspectives, creating 
a decadent, layered story about violence, 
women and wartime.

Mengiste pulls heavily from Greek 

storytelling influences, even including 
a Greek chorus in her tale of epic fights. 
She effectively rebrands and reframes 
a 1930s conflict into a Homeric myth, 
complete with capricious higher powers, 
irresponsible kings and fighting women. 
Usually, World War II-adjacent literature 
and media focus on the grittiness of 
war, the trenches, and the broken men. 
Mengiste takes a different approach to 
make the war feel real. She dulls the 
everyday traumas, mythologizing to make 
the novel read like a bad memory. Though 
softened by time, the war is still a jagged 
edge: painful, sharp and traumatic. 

Mengiste’s 
technical 
skill 
and 

reinvention of the war genre make her 
a favorite to win. Her lyrical prose and 
consistent storytelling leave nothing to 
be desired, fortifying her already lofty 
chances of becoming the 2020 Booker 
Prize Winner.

— Elizabeth Yoon, Daily Arts Writer

Avni Doshi, ‘Burnt Sugar’
“Burnt Sugar” is unlike anything I’ve 

read before. Shortlisted for the 2020 
Booker Prize, debut author Avni Doshi 
unpacks 
a 
volatile 
mother-daughter 

relationship that often does more harm 
than good. It’s a story that exposes our 
ugly emotions — our biases and flaws — 
and the threads of love that still persist 
in our tangled network of relationships. 
The novel lives and breathes its setting 
— Pune, India — and gives unfamiliar 
readers a new perspective on the bustling 
subcontinent. “Burnt Sugar” is a fantastic, 
quick and captivating read for anyone, but 
especially for those of Indian heritage. 

Will “Burnt Sugar” win the 2020 

Booker Prize? Unlikely. Does it deserve 
to? I think so, but as the daughter of 
Indian immigrants, I’m biased. The novel 
is unique in its piercing and unapologetic 
words. It makes us confront and pick 

apart our own relationships until we’re 
unsettled by our dependency on others. 
Yet, accessibility to Indian culture is a 
roadblock that could cost the novel a 
shot at the prize. Read “Burnt Sugar” for 
the thrill, but don’t expect it to shock the 
world.

— Trina Pal, Daily Arts Writer

Brandon Taylor, ‘Real Life’
“Real Life” is a fascinating character 

study that dissects trauma as it relates 
to race, sexuality and mental health. 
We follow Wallace, a Black, queer PhD 
candidate at a predominately white 
university, as he navigates a number 
of difficult social situations that force 
him to confront his own neuroses. The 
incredibly rich narration Taylor presents 
through Wallace makes the novel’s slow 
pacing more than worthwhile. Wallace’s 
psychological development is allowed to 
unfold naturally; Taylor’s guiding hand 
is nearly invisible for the entirety of the 
novel, letting Wallace’s character speak 
for itself. This book’s likelihood of winning 
depends on the selection committee’s 
priorities. If they seek an experimental, 
groundbreaking story this year, “Real 
Life” won’t fit the bill. No narrative 
technique or device in this novel will blow 
readers away. However, what the novel 
does within its scope, it does extremely 
well. Taylor is modest in his aims, but 
greatly exceeds expectations, creating a 
gut-wrenching story that would certainly 
make for a fantastic Booker Prize winner.

— Sejjad Alkhalby, Daily Arts Writer

THE LONGLIST

Gabriel Krauze, ‘Who They Was’
In the realm of Booker Prize nominees, 

“Who They Was” is like the scrappy, rag-
tag small town team that somehow made 
it to the Regional Championship. You just 
want it to win, even if the odds are stacked 
against it.

The novel is rough around the edges — 

it does not fool the reader into accepting 
a tidy story tied up with a bow. This is a 
work of honesty more than it is a work 
of mastery, but Gabriel Krauze offers up 
skillfully layered narration and emotional 
depth rarely seen in a debut novel.

An unrelenting work of autofiction, 

“Who They Was” grips the reader in its 
tone of fragile apathy towards a violent 
way of life. The story is narrated by 

Snoopz, a young man living a dual life as 
a criminal and a university student — torn 
between two opposing paths.

Krauze compares each person’s life 

to a gigantic column, “you can’t ever see 
all the way around it in one go, so people 
only ever get to see the side that’s in their 
immediate view.” Yet this novel somehow 
captures every side of life all at once — we 
can’t wait to see what Krauze does next.

— Julian Wray, Daily Arts Writer

Hillary Mantel, ‘The Mirror and The 

Light’

Hilary Mantel, two-time winner of 

the Booker Prize, brings her critically 
acclaimed Wolf Hall series to an end that’s 
almost as decisive as the execution that 
kicks off the final installment of the series. 
“The Mirror and the Light,” more than 
anything, is the culmination of an 11-year 
character study of Thomas Cromwell, one 
of the closest confidantes of Henry VIII, a 
king best known for his six marriages that 
sparked the English Reformation. The 
novel covers Cromwell’s final years, before 
he was beheaded in 1540 for spurious 
charges of treason against the king. 

Though “The Mirror” is the third book 

in Mantel’s series, the strength of its well-
developed and fleshed out characters help 
this novel stand on its own. Cromwell’s 
hopes and fears are palpable, as Mantel’s 
focus constantly circles back around to 
the litany of enemies he’s made on his 
climb to the top. The resulting profound 
sense of unease not only unseats the 
reader, it also plunges them deeper into 
the experience. Mantel capitalizes on 
the dread that the knowledge of history 
brings, and spends the novel building this 
tension up. She weaponizes the stress 
resulting from waiting for the other shoe 
to drop, and peppers the experience with 
heartfelt moments between the reader 
and Cromwell, endearing him further 
before his untimely death. Though “The 
Mirror and the Light” may not have made 
the shortlist for the Booker Prize this year, 
the legacy of Mantel’s Cromwell trilogy 
will certainly remain.

— Tate Lafrenier, Daily Arts Writer

Colum McCann, ‘Apeirogon’
“Apeirogon”’ by Colum McCann is a 

literary feat of storytelling. Its story, based 
on the true tale of an Israeli father and a 
Palestinian father, both of whom violently 
lose their daughters, sneaks up on you. 

Very little of the novel is chronological 
narration; instead, McCann offers the 
reader 
small 
pieces 
of 
information 

until the picture is complete, and then 
he continues to fill it in. His masterful 
prose is poetic in style and flexible for 
the innovative format of the book — over 
one thousand “chapters,” most less than 
one page long. He combines meticulous 
research with lyrical language in a way 
that seeps every page in raw emotion — a 
difficult task for a book that is over 450 
pages. McCann does not shy away from 
the length, or the distinctive storytelling 
style; instead, he embraces it. He uses 
the freedom that his chosen format 
gives him to tell a story in a new way, 
not chronologically, but emotionally. He 
reconstructs the experience of grief and 
mirrors the emotions of the fathers, by 
telling the story in such a scattershot way. 
Deeply moving, emotionally exhausting 
and literarily accomplished, “Apeirogon” 
captures the soul of its characters within 
its pages — and perhaps within the heart 
of the reader, as well.

— Emilia Ferrante, Daily Arts Writer

Kiley Reid, ‘Such a Fun Age’
Kiley Reid’s debut novel “Such a Fun 

Age” is predictably included on the 
2020 Booker Prize longlist. It received 
almost immediate recognition upon its 
publication — a trend that hasn’t faltered 
yet. 

“Such a Fun Age” explores the 

transactional 
relationship 
between 

a white blogger, Alix, and her Black 
babysitter, Emira. The book opens with 
a family emergency that prompts Alix to 
call for Emira’s service late one night and 
ends with a security guard accusing Emira 
of kidnapping Alix’s daughter. The effects 
of this incident stir different anxieties 
in both the women as well as larger 
discussions of race, privilege and class. 

Despite Reid’s ability to genuinely 

portray the broken systems that drive the 
character’s actions, while simultaneously 
challenging the reader’s own biases, the 
story is undermined by the emotional 
distance perpetrated by the overlapping 
narratives and artificial dialogue. These 
imperfections slow the pace of the novel 
and emphasize its abrupt ending. The 
novel provokes significant discussion, but 
its issues of progression keep it from being 
Booker Prize quality.

THE BOOKER PRIZE COMMITTEE

Kali Uchis wants you to know that 

a language barrier doesn’t prevent you 
from enjoying her music. 

Earlier this month, the 26-year-

old 
Colombian 
American 
singer 

released her first Spanish-language 
album, Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros 
Demonios). Though highly anticipated 
by the majority of her fanbase, 
some English-speaking fans voiced 
their apprehension for the project 
— they felt it would fail to remain 
relatable and personally meaningful 
in a different language. Seemingly 
in response to these concerns, Uchis 
tweeted with the release of single “la 
luz” in October, “today i drop another 
song in spanish which i know means 
another day of disappointment for my 
english speaking fans who do not wish 
to make the attempt to listen to music 
in languages they can’t understand.” 
Despite the R&B princess’ unabashed 
celebration of Latin language and 
culture on prior projects like Por Vida 
(2015) and Isolation (2018), many of her 
American listeners are still resistant 
to 
embracing 
foreign-language 

music. It represents a larger issue in 
our industry, which though steadily 
diversifying, has only just warmed 

up to breakout multilingual acts like 
Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny and 
Korean boy band BTS. On Sin Miedo, 
Uchis reminds us that good music 
transcends these bounds of language. 

Known for her sultry California-

glam aesthetic, Uchis’ lush vocals feel 
right at home on her latest project. Yet 
opener “la luna enamorada” may be 
surprising to some fans, both for Uchis’ 
uncharacteristically 
deep 
register 

and the song’s bolero-style structure. 
Bolero, a type of slow-tempo music 
first popularized in 19th century Cuba, 
is just one of many different Latin 
genres that make an appearance on the 
album. “la luna enamorada” sets the 
tone for the rest of the project, as Uchis 
presents the listener with a microcosm 

of modern Latin music, incorporating 
everything from reggaetón to bachata 
into the soulful R&B pop that made 
Uchis famous. 

With the project’s release in mid-

November, Uchis tweeted, “this album 
is full of so many genres that made my 
childhood & i am very proud of its range 
of emotions & nostalgia. i hope it brings 
you any bit of the joy it has brought 
me.” Growing up in both Alexandria, 
Virginia and Pereira, Colombia, Uchis 
has fully embraced her multicultural 
upbringing 
on 
Sin 
Miedo, 
citing 

influences like Panamanian reggaetón 
group La Factoría and Cuban bolero 
singer La Lupe.

Her 
ability 
to 
master 
both 

traditional Latin sounds and newly 
developing ones is further testament to 
Uchis’ artistic growth since Isolation. 
She gives us a velvety cover of “Que 
te pedí,” La Lupe’s most famous work 
from the 1960s, while also infusing 
elements of neoperreo, a burgeoning 
experimental subsect of reggaetón, on 
tracks like “la luz(Fín)” and “te pongo 
mal(prendalo).” Uchis’ roots in pop 
and R&B are not lost on Sin Miedo 
either, with infectiously fun synth 
ballads “telepatía” and “aguardiente y 
limón” and the luxuriously seductive 
“vaya con dios.” It’s evident that Uchis 
is becoming a savant of a variety 
of different sounds, all the while 

developing a self-assured voice absent 
on earlier works like Por Vida. 

On the track “¡aquí yo mando!” 

Uchis makes her inviolable confidence 
known with the help of a bilingual 
feature from rapper Rico Nasty. Uchis 
declares on the song’s chorus, “Mando, 
aquí yo mando, si quieres conmigo 
vete acostumbrando,” translating in 
English to, “I command, here I call the 
shots, if you want to be with me get used 
to it.” Gone are the “Loner”-era days of 
solitude and introversion in love. On 
Sin Miedo, Uchis now demands respect 
not only in her relationships but in the 
ranks of American R&B stardom. Even 
Uchis’ vocal range has flourished since 
her last project, with soul-clenching 
contraltos on “la luna enamorada” and 
shimmering high notes on tracks like 
“vaya con dios.” Uchis invites you to 
kindly refrain from putting her in any 
type of box, a clear departure from 
earlier days of consistently marketable 
mainstream hits. 

In honor of Uchis truly owning her 

sound on Sin Miedo, its production 
presents a refreshing switch-up from 
her previous works. Puerto Rican 
producer Tainy, who’s churned out 
mega hits for Latin talents like J 
Balvin and Daddy Yankee, shines 
through on the record (in major 
contrast to the industry heavy-hitters 
that have collected production credits 

on Por Vida and Isolation). In much 
of Uchis’ older music, underlying 
influences from collaborators like 
Tyler the Creator and Kevin Parker 
have peeked through and, at times, 
drowned out her own voice. Yet on her 
latest release, Uchis has fully taken 
the reins, refusing to bend to the will 
of what popular American culture is 
comfortable with. While Sin Miedo 
places less emphasis on storytelling 
and vulnerable lyricism than Isolation, 
it remains a deeply personal work 
by embracing the elements of Uchis’ 
sonically diverse adolescence. 

Sin Miedo is by all accounts a 

success for Uchis, widening her career 
trajectory and proving that the artist is 
able to charm listeners in both English 
and Spanish. Never does Uchis dilute 
her Latin roots in an effort to appeal to 
American audiences, instead injecting 
these cultural foundations with the 
ethereal candy-colored elegance that 
earned her popularity in the first 
place. Whether you’re fluent or relying 
on Google Translate to understand 
Uchis’ words, Sin Miedo reminds us 
that in expanding our musical palettes 
to include multilingual works, we are 
opened up to a whole new world of 
beautiful art.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Three weeks ago, Kalie Shorr 

released “My Voice,” an anthemic 
middle finger to the country radio 
system that will “probably never 
play me ‘cause I’m not a boy.” As 
bold as it is, “My Voice” falls in 
line with Shorr’s other aptly-titled 
projects — her debut record Open 
Book from 2019 and newly-minted 
iHeartRadio podcast “Too Much 
to Say” both cast Shorr as someone 
who speaks her mind.

“I hate the notion of shut up 

and sing,” Shorr said in a Zoom 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “Just because I have more 
followers than someone else going 
off on Facebook doesn’t mean I 
don’t have the right to my opinion,” 
Shorr continued. “And I have a lot 
of them these days.”

Not 
only 
has 
sharing 
her 

opinions paid off by producing 
clever and stinging dollops of 
truth in songs like “My Voice,” but 
Shorr’s confessional songwriting 
and sharp eye for everyday spools 
of tension landed Open Book on 
New York Times’ Best Albums 
of 2019. Open Book compellingly 
weaves Shorr’s disclosures into a 
cohesive storyline.

“I always wanted to make that 

album chronological for sure,” 
Shorr said. “‘Alice in Wonderland’ 
has the literary theme, so does 
‘Gatsby.’ But with ‘Too Much to Say’ 
about halfway through writing it, I 
was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is going 

to be the intro track.’ So as soon as 
we realized that we were able to 
write the rest of the song with that 
in mind. And as soon as I wrote that 
song and while I was writing it, I 
kind of saw everything happen.”

“Too Much to Say,” which 

inspired the title of Shorr’s podcast, 
warns “Oh honey, I’m not trying 
to shock you, I don’t want to freak 
you out / I’m just talking about the 
things that we don’t talk about” atop 
harmonica and rollicking electric 
guitar riffs. Across various episodes 
of her podcast, Shorr explains the 
events that “Too Much to Say” (the 
record’s thesis statement) hints 
at. Losing people to “heroin and 
cheating” is expanded as her (now) 
ex-boyfriend’s infidelity and her 
sister’s death.

“The reason I did it was because 

that year was so crazy and the 
album ended up being very topical, 
just because of the gravity of the 
situations that inspired it,” Shorr 
said of the album’s structure. “You 
know, there wasn’t a lot else for me 
to think about. I wasn’t going to put 
a song about like, going out with the 
girls, that wasn’t really the nature 
of that year.”

Having signed a record deal 

with tmwrk records this October, 
Shorr has the opportunity to fill 
in more details of the story on 
Open Book: Unabridged coming 
out Dec. 4.

“So what was really cool about 

the album is that we put all the 
bonus tracks dispersed throughout 
it as opposed to just all at the end, 
because they really do fit into the 

story,” Shorr said of the new record. 
“All they’re doing is elaborating on 
what was mentioned in other songs 
and making a whole song out of it.”

The latest piece of elaboration 

“Lying to Myself” came out last 
week. 

“That 
song 
is 
really 
cool 

sonically and I had a really great 
time producing it. It kind of 
feels a little bit like ‘Bitter Sweet 
Symphony’ by The Verve, but it’s 
also got some really cool country 
instruments in it,” Shorr explained. 
“I said everything in the song that 
I wanted to text to this person, but 
I didn’t, and it just came out really 
stream of consciousness.”

In the song, she traces the 

breakdown of what was always a 
fragile relationship. Shorr admits 
in the lyrics: “I picked out all my 
favorite things you said, then like a 
delusional architect / I built you up 
like a house of cards.”

“I feel like that’s something that, 

you know, we all wonder, especially 
at the end of a relationship, you’re 
like, did you promise me too much 
and then not follow through? Or 
did I just literally invent this person 
in my head and then try to make 
you that person?” she said.

A lot of Shorr’s lyrics are rooted 

in disarming honesty and wit. 
Take this line from “Gatsby” for 
example: “Is that all there is to a 
broken heart? Lean Cuisines in my 
shopping cart.”

Why I return to ‘Mr. Fox’ 
every Thanksgiving break

We all know that Thanksgiving 

is a sham and that it was really 
fucked up that our kindergarten 
teachers had us make feather 
hats and pick out our spirit 
animals. As an education major, 
I worry about how I might deal 
with Thanksgiving if I’m placed 
in a school district that isn’t 
super cool with telling kids about 
genocide. I don’t want to outright 
tell them that “Pocahontas” 
was actually twelve years old 
when John Smith raped her and 
ruin “The Colors of the Wind” 
for them, but I also don’t want 
to celebrate colonization and 
mislead them into believing in 
some myth about a peaceful 
exchange of maize and turkey. 

So instead, I just eat a lot of 

food and hug my mom and watch 
“Fantastic Mr. Fox.” A lot of 
director Wes Anderson’s (“The 
Grand Budapest Hotel”) films 
could work for the autumnal vibe 
because of his love of the color 
orange, but “Fantastic Mr. Fox” 
has all the gratitude and gluttony 
that I need to feel okay when I’m 
home for the holidays.

Based on the Roald Dahl novel 

of the same name, “Fantastic Mr. 
Fox” was released in 2009 to a 
semi-modest box office of around 
$46 million in comparison to its 
$40 million budget. I guess I get 
it: It’s one of Dahl’s less popular 
books, and American audiences 
have this kind of aversion to 
stop-motion, to the point where 
I’ve had friends tell me they 
only enjoyed the film when they 

got older because they were 
scared by the animation style 
when they first saw it. But with 
a star-studded cast consisting 
of typical Andersonite cronies 
like 
Bill 
Murray 
(“Lost 
in 

Translation”) and Willem Dafoe 
(“The Lighthouse”), it deserved 
better. It was nominated for 
Best Original Score and Best 
Animated Feature at the 2010 
Academy 
Awards, 
but 
lost 

both to “Up,” which I have less 
respect for because of the Disney 
machine, but Roald Dahl was just 
as anti-Semitic as Walt Disney, so 
it’s a lose/lose anyway.

The plot follows Mr. Fox 

(George 
Clooney, 
“Ocean’s 

Eleven”) as he battles a kind 
of middle-aged (in fox years) 
suburban ennui — no, really — 
by going back to his old ways of 
thievery. A group of baddies led 
by a man named Bean (Michael 
Gambon, “Harry Potter and the 
Prisoner of Azkaban”) terrorize 
him and the other woodland 
creatures for stealing from their 
farms. The book actually ends 
at around the second act of the 
film, when Foxy — as Mr. Fox’s 
wife 
Felicity 
(Meryl 
Streep, 

“Kramer vs. Kramer”) calls him 
— tricks them into waiting at 
a manhole for them to appear 
from their underground home, 
giving them the freedom to steal 
from the unattended farms. 
The film extends its runtime by 
adding a guns-ablazing fight and 
having the animals steal from 
the farmers’ supermarket chain 
instead. 

It might not sound a lot like 

Thanksgiving so far, but hear 
me out. The great feasting that 

the animals do after stealing 
from their oppressors is really 
gratifying to watch over stuffing 
and mashed potatoes. My siblings 
and I talk over most of the movie 
or recite the lines like it’s a 
showing of “Rocky Horror,” but 
there are a couple of scenes that 
we’re always dead silent during. 

Early in the movie, Foxy 

reflects on his life, and how he 
had to stop his adventures once 
he had a cub. 

“I don’t want to live in a hole 

anymore,” he tells his wife. “It 
makes me feel poor.”

“We are poor. But, we’re 

happy,” she says.

Then, at the end of the day, 

he stands at the top of their 
new house in the trunk of a tree 
with his landlord Kylie (Wallace 
Wolodarsky, 
“The 
Darjeeling 

Limited”) — which, by the way, is 
so Americana. 

Foxy says, “Who am I, Kylie...? 

Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a 
beetle, or a bald eagle? I’m saying 
this more as, like, existentialism, 
you know? Who am I? And how 
can a fox ever be happy without, 
you’ll forgive the expression, a 
chicken in its teeth?” 

It’s a common trope in kids 

movies: undermine the silliness 
with some sobering reference 
to adult problems. But here, it’s 
genuine. It’s not just going for a 
chuckle, even though the whole 
film makes me laugh out loud 
every time I watch it. The thing 
is, it’s not really a kids movie, it’s 
just a movie. Anderson takes his 
audience seriously, no matter 
how old they are. We all want 
to be free and wild, whether 
that means playing in the mud 

at recess or unbuttoning our 
oxfords at our 9-5. How can we 
be happy without a chicken in 
our teeth? 

Anderson 
takes 
it 
even 

further: A running gag is Foxy’s 
pathological fear of wolves. When 
we finally meet one in the final 
act, it’s startlingly emotional. The 
wolf isn’t sentient in the same way 
that the other characters are, only 
communicating nonverbally and 
walking on all fours. The group 
of animals asks him if he thinks 
they’re in for a long winter, and 
the wolf “says” he doesn’t know. 
They wish him luck and drive on 
by on their motorbike. 

For 
years 
and 
years, 
I 

wondered, “Why is Foxy afraid 
of wolves? Aren’t they just like 
him?” And that’s kind of the 
point. We want the chicken in 
our teeth, but who are we once 
we get it? Foxy puts his family 
in danger just so he can get a 
rush of adrenaline from his 
kleptomania, and then when he 
gets it, it’s actually really scary. 
An integral part of him hinges on 
how he gave up his wild side for 

his family, but he doesn’t actually 
want to give up his subdued life 
with them, even if he thinks 
he does. The wilderness seems 
pretty fun before you read about 
wolves eating their own young.

In the end, though the wolf is 

still distant, he reconciles with 
it, like I have to reconcile with 
the contradicting part of me that 
wants to be unrestrained and 
angry and mean like a bad dog, and 
the other part of me that wants 
to be polite when somebody says 
something stupid. We have to 
choose if we want to be the wolf 
or the well-respected man about 
town. It’s a complicated message 
for a “kids” movie, and maybe I’m 
overthinking it, but Anderson 
makes it work.

The majority of the movie 

deals 
with 
Foxy’s 
identity 

crisis, but my personal favorite 
dive 
into 
individuality 
is 

through Foxy’s son Ash (Jason 
Schwartzman, 
“Rushmore”). 

His b-plot is all about his envy 
for his more athletic, popular 
cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase 
Anderson, “The Life Aquatic 

with Steve Zissou”). As a kind of 
ugly ten-year-old with perpetual 
middle child syndrome, his story 
got me.

That’s the second scene that my 

siblings and I shut our mouths for:

“Ash,” his mother says. “I know 

what it’s like to feel … different. 
We’re all different. Especially 
him,” she says, pointing to his 
father. “But there’s something 
kind of fantastic about that, isn’t 
there?”

Instant tears. 
Sidenote: The scene where Ash 

silently bonds with Kristofferson 
as they watch his electric train 
go round and round his room is 
ultimate reconciliation, in a way 
the colonists never knew. There’s 
nothing that hurts like your lab 
partner looking at somebody 
else, and there’s nothing harder 
than making peace with who 
they’re looking at. Nobody is as 
empathetic as a 12-year-old who 
thinks their dad kind of hates 
them.

Anthems for a bedroomed 
youth: Benee’s ‘Hey u x’

Benee has had the spotlight 

trained on her since the explosion 
of her 2019 hit single, “Supalonely”: 
a song that appears on her debut 
album Hey u x, as well as on TikTok, 
where 
the 
addictive 
chorus 

soundtracked endless imitations 
of a dance popularized by the app’s 
megastars. The attention she has 
thus received off the coattails of the 
natural and slightly coincidental 
celebrity that these dance crazes 
gift artists is entirely warranted. 
Benee, whose real name is Stella 
Rose Bennett, has an undeniable 
talent for pop music, a seemingly 
endless knack for ear-catching 
phrases and intensely direct lyrics 
which never stop being satisfying. 

Hey u x comes straight from the 

environment of the teenagers alone 
in their bedrooms crafting comedy 
sketches, 
spewing 
out 
their 

innermost thoughts or just sharing 
generally ridiculous moments from 
their lives. She sits comfortably 
within the classic social media 
tradition of reaching out to any 
potential audience. The relatability 
of the lyrics is turned up to the max. 
As a self-proclaimed “weird girl” 
without actually being alienating 
or unmarketable, anyone who 
has ever felt alone, unappreciated 
or jealous will find solace in the 
songs here. The song “Happen to 
Me” details her existential anxiety, 
and Bennett morosely sings about 
her overthinking. She’s terrified 
of death and of growing old. It’s 
fitting that this is the first song, 

as it sets the stage for what lies in 
the back of her mind as she details 
the other minutiae of her life. Each 
song consequently describes the 
petty dramas that distract us from 
our eventual end. Woozy, hazy 
instrumentation aids in setting the 
stage for semi-hornily pining after 
someone else. Multiple songs detail 
lusting after a man; one who is 
inherently disappointing, or where 
Bennett blames herself or other 
women for his actions. 

It’s this lack of self-confidence 

that is endemic of social media 
culture. 
When 
you 
have 
a 

medium 
that 
snatches 
away 

the most fundamental human 
elements of communication, while 
simultaneously 
gaslighting 
the 

user that they are more connected 
than ever, people are bound to feel 
depressed or simply unwanted. 
The inhuman aspect of social 
media is untraversable. You won’t 
see anyone’s facial reactions to 
what you post, there’s no smell 
or heat from the people you meet 
in cyberspace. Sans video games, 
there’s no shared experiences you 
can have with these people. It’s all 
an unfulfilling simulation of actual 
life. Like most of our generation, 
the so-called “digital natives,” 
Benee is chained to the internet. 
The other musicians that appear 
on Hey u x only further cement 
this fact. The feature list is stacked 
with artists who’ve also enjoyed 
massive success on TikTok (Bakar, 
Flo Milli, Kenny Beats, Lily Allen). 
Bennett constructs an album of the 
most contemporary sounds and 
topics possible. It’s clear that her 
thoughts are dominated by angst, 

anxiety, nervousness, all from the 
fear and overwhelming presence of 
isolation, but also from the effects 
of being young. As a symbol of the 
state of Gen Z, her messaging lends 
itself to a concerning rise in our 
current consciousness.

We’ve 
prized 
youth 
and 

shirked a more fulfilling path. 
It’s an ill-defined category that is 
constructed around the goodwill 
and customs of our culture. The 
danger in not accepting adulthood 
is of denying reality, and never fully 
growing. Of course, adulthood is 
fraught with depressive visions 
of responsibility and a lack of self 
autonomy. There’s the possibility 
your life will be subjugated by 
endless work and obligations. But 
this does not mean that we should 
retreat into a fantasy of comfort 
that exists through the goodwill of 
those who came before us. There 
is beauty in adulthood and all the 
relationships that can blossom in 
this condition. Arguably, it’s where 
the most complex and varied ones 
arise. So it is just with a cautious 
mind that we should grow, and 
prioritize the people around us, 
and the joy that comes from them 
as we age together. Benee is a voice 
for the bedroomed youth; those 
who feel that there is no future, so 
cling to a comforting innocence 
that they’ve always known. People 
who self-infantilize until their 
physical reality no longer matches 
their mental condition, and until 
we stop viewing the internet as 
our primary place, we may never 
escape.

Opinion

B

efore this election and 
the 
anti-democracy 

maneuvering that quickly 

ensued, 
Amy 
Coney 
Barrett’s 

appointment 
to 
the 
Supreme 

Court had already destroyed any 
expectation the American left may 
have had for mutual respect between 
them and the Republican Party. Now, 
let’s be clear: reducing the identity of 
any Supreme Court justice to their 
nominating party is a mistake. But 
in an ideal world where people abide 
by morals rather than their hunger 
for power and control, Barrett would 
have refused the appointment. 

I do not say this as a thinly veiled 

insult. I simply would like to trust 
that when a venerated Supreme 
Court justice, requests as her dying 
wish that the incumbent party wait 
to make a new appointment, the 
incumbent party would respect the 
wish. Barrett is smart and it would be 
a mistake to not regard her as such. 
She is an individual shaped by many 
cultural factors and an upbringing 
in the Catholic Church. She opposes 
abortion and that’s her individual 
choice. I’d argue something of far 
greater importance — more so than 
her stance as a Republican — is 
Barrett’s commitment to originalism.

What is originalism? It signals 

that a judge would, as a rule, cite 
original precedent in writing any 
new opinion or decision. In effect, 
it makes interpretation vulnerable 
to history. However, the law is 
meant to be updated for a reason. 
The implementation of new Civil 
Rights statutes, building on what 
came before, expands our existing 
freedoms and builds toward a better 
world. The ability to do this arguably 
depends on the maintenance of the 
precedents we have now, rather than 
a return to those from hundreds 
of years prior. In a recent op-ed for 
the Chronicle of Higher Education, 
Oliver Traldi laments how recently, 
everyone 
from 
philosophers 

to literature scholars with “no 
knowledge” 
of 
originalism 
has 

emerged to denounce the practice. 
In saying so, Traldi repeatedly 
declared this was not only arrogant, 
but also showed a lack of respect for a 
foundational judicial ideology. 

At the outset, it is important 

to acknowledge that originalism 
is used by all judges sometimes, 
particularly concerning the scope of 
the application of any constitutional 
law. At its core, however, such a 
belief system taken to its extreme 
perpetuates the notion that the 
state, as it was built at our country’s 
founding, has more insight into 
modern life than we as modern 
citizens do. Therefore, originalism 
seems to imply the state can know a 
hypothetical or actual situation better 
than we do. Most problematically, 
this approach insinuates modern 
science isn’t one of the most relevant 
tools at our disposal for determining 
the moral actions of so-called rational 
actors. 

We don’t use neuroscientific 

research enough as is — a feature of 
our modern heyday of contemptuous 
anti-intellectualism. We don’t need 
more extreme anti-intellectualism, 
and it is not at all appropriate to 
undermine science in any situation. 
No matter one’s political viewpoint, 
it is antithetical to our society’s 
well-being to continue cutting the 
floor out from beneath our scientific 
institutions in this way — even and 
especially in the courtroom, which 
is meant to protect the citizens it 
serves by obtaining the most accurate 
version of truth that it can.

I also interpret Barrett’s stance as 

an originalist to mean she believes 
the state has supreme power to 
enforce more carceral values in the 
guise of “protecting” its citizens 
while glossing over the demonstrable 
ineffectiveness of resulting policies. 

This cuts both ways, actually. 
For example, the victims’ rights 
movement of the 1970s established a 
then-novel idea that victims should 
have a voice in the courtroom. 
Before the VRM, the state simply 
did whatever it saw fit in deciding 
on retributive punishment for the 
victim, but the victim wasn’t afforded 
any agency in these decisions. 
The interpretation of the victim 
as irrelevant in court proceedings 
has its roots in the original laws’ 
texts; consequently, victim impact 
statements are recent developments. 

The Victim’s Rights Bill, also 

known as Proposition 8, was passed 
in 1982. Before its passage, victims 
either weren’t addressed at all or 
were regarded as property and 
therefore void of agency. Doris 
Tate, the mother of slain Manson 
victim Sharon Tate, was a major 
proponent of this bill — she read 
the first Victim Impact Statement 
in 1976 to persuade the court not to 
grant parole to Charles Manson’s 
followers. The long-standing notion 
of a victim’s irrelevance before the 
VRB was a vestige of British common 
law, under which victims were the 
property of the king and so any crime 
was technically committed against 
the king. Even today the idea of 
victims’ voices having a role in court 
is complicated by archaic notions of 
textualism under the law as it applies 
to, say, domestic violence situations.

In a situation fueled by primal 

brain stem activities in the form 
of shifting brain chemistry — 
evolutionary 
advantages 
meant 

to protect humans in dangerous 
situations — humans are still 
assessed as rational thinkers, which 
is itself nonscientific. Psychiatrist 
Dana Ross from the University of 
Toronto writes that the prefrontal 
cortex “normally helps us think, 
plan and solve problems and brain 
imaging shows it goes ‘offline’ with 
far less activity when undergoing a 
trauma — or reliving one.” Knowing 
what 
neuroscience 
has 
shown 

us regarding the way the brain 
typically reacts in life-threatening 
situations, the idea that someone in 
the throes of domestic abuse is able 
to override their brain chemistry is a 
willful twisting of facts — an excuse 
to punish individuals who dare 
defend themselves. By extension, 
referring to foundational precedent 
that has long been usurped by new 
precedent rewinds the clock to a time 
when none of this information was 
available to us.

Take a hostage situation, where 

an abuse victim shoots their abuser 
but it’s determined the abuser’s 
weapon wasn’t known to be active. 
If someone truly adheres to the 
principle of the rational actor in 
such a situation, where science has 
shown the brain’s chemistry to 
be fundamentally different than 
usual and there is a precedent of 
aggressors possibly using force, the 
originalist judge is fundamentally 
trampling on and constraining that 
person’s right to defend their life — by 
declaring defensive force somehow 
wasn’t warranted. Paradoxically, 
Barrett’s anti-abortion ideals, her 
Catholicism and her originalism are 
all in conflict here; all of these ideas 
of hers are loosely coded excuses 
for rewinding the clock by at least 
70 years and rescinding the civil 
rights that marginalized groups, 
traditionally excluded from power 
and not granted rights, have received 
only recently. 

Citing outdated precedents and 

opinions, which existed before we 
could even conceive of serotonin and 
norepinephrine — chemicals related 
to fight or flight — would likely lead 
to interpreting someone threatened 
with death as having the same 
capacity for rational thought as, say, 
someone taking a stroll in a museum. 

Rather than paying attention 

to Barrett’s status as a woman, or 
even as a Republican, we should 
cut through all that distracting flak 
and ask ourselves: What morals will 
Barrett bring, or not bring, to the 
Court? 

What I refer to here isn’t related 

to Barrett’s race, class or gender: It 
is her ability to apply rules to facts in 
a way that would manage to escape 
profoundly distorting bias, such as 
her faith in the mirage of idealism 
that was the founders’ vision for 
the Constitution. This desperate 
reach for a nonexistent ideal world 
populated by perfectly rational 
actors would buckle under the 
horrors of today’s post-industrial 
violence. I don’t want to disparage 
Barrett’s intellect — that is uncalled 
for. Unfortunately, when it comes to 
matters regarding the importance 
of the state in people’s lives, I don’t 
trust her ability to apply ethical 
principles to those whose lives 
are steeped in poverty or unduly 
influenced by other accidents of 
birth. 

Understanding 
the 
role 
of 

context is the foundation of equity. 
Perhaps the victim was born with 
a disability and coerced into a 
relationship. Maybe the victim fled 
with bloodshed at their heels and 
was similarly coerced by a predatory 
partner. Not to mention biological 
context, such as when a child’s life 
is inviable (e.g. they won’t survive 
outside the womb) or when the 
mother’s life is threatened. In any 
scenario, the victim’s social, personal 
and biological contexts are read as 
irrelevant when a judge abides by 
the law’s original text; absolutist 
thinking overpowers science to 
the point of regression and near-
silencing of crucial context. This 
approach is anathema to reality and 
science has produced mountains of 
evidence showing precisely how.

Admittedly, in reading over 

any of Barrett’s opinions one has 
the urge to defect to optimism, 
even while immersed in their own 
inescapable, blunting cynicism. We 
live in the United States in 2020, 
so relating Barrett’s appointment 
back to the prevailing climate that 
surrounds 
her 
is 
unavoidable. 

But I was determined to get to 
the bottom of what was at the 
core of her appointment. I would 
argue Barrett’s appointment is the 
product of a capitalist individualism 
with capricious roots in the idea 
that your idea of liberty, and my 
idea of liberty, are each inferior 
iterations of some brand of original, 
categorically 
certain 
liberty 

determined hundreds of years ago. 
Individualism and originalism are 
woven into the same mélange of 
American mythos, which constrains 
responsibility to the individual 
or a tapestry of individuals in 
isolation, rather than expanding 
the responsibility to include our 
legal system and its networked 
supports or institutions. Therefore, 
the lack of right to due process 
presses especially hard upon those 
already not favored by the system, a 
structuring fact an originalist such as 
Barrett isn’t likely to acknowledge as 
noteworthy.

In any case, it is unjust to mute 

this background or to bury it 
under the narcosis of “tradition.” 
The problem here is Barrett’s 
demonstrated commitment to ideas 
that are hundreds of years old while 
her supporters declare her to be an 
empowered woman by virtue of 
being a mother with a Juris Doctor. 
Supporting Barrett’s approach is the 
equivalent of declaring bloodletting 
with leeches to be standard, best 
medical practice.

University is housing logic over undergraduates
I

nsanity, 
according 
to 

Albert 
Einstein, 
is 
doing 

the same thing repeatedly 

and expecting different results. 
Unfortunately, some of us are so 
darn stubborn that we believe we’re 
right even when we aren’t and repeat 
the same mistakes. My psychology 
professor would call this an inability 
to perform metacognition: a failure 
to recognize our incompetence. 
But, the University of Michigan is 
ahead of the curve — literally and 
figuratively.

On Nov. 6, University President 

Mark Schlissel effectively closed 
most of the undergraduate residence 
halls for the winter semester due to 
increasing COVID-19 cases. With 
Thanksgiving break beginning on 
Nov. 20, most freshmen will have 
vacated campus, leaving those 
residing in off-campus housing as 
the remaining majority.

The decision has undoubtedly 

left undergraduates disconcerted. 
Out-of-state students are finding 
apartments, storage options for 
their items for the next ten months 
or moving back home. At this rate, 
students have a better chance 
at winning the Powerball than 
securing a sublease. Not to mention, 
we have to navigate final projects, 
papers and exams. The amount 
of stress we’re experiencing is 
unrivaled. 
Furthermore, 
there’s 

a heavy emotional weight to the 
University’s actions. 

Many 
of 
the 
University’s 

restrictions over the past three 
months have waned or felt less 
impactful, but losing the winter is 
too big a burden to bear, right? As 
if losing the latter half of our senior 
year in high school wasn’t enough, 
now we’re forced to forgo the second 
part of our freshman year as well? 

Granted, the “college experience” 
we’ve all fantasized about hasn’t 
truly come to fruition, but we could 
still hope, right?

Wrong. 
We can’t. Quite frankly, we 

shouldn’t. As much as we think we 
can control the actions of others, we 
cannot. Consequently, COVID-19 
has jeopardized first-year students’ 
safety far more than it should have. 
Some of us have been more vigilant 
in following Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention protocols 
than others, but the minority who 
believed they were invincible spoiled 
the winter 2021 semester for most of 
the undergraduate population.

In the midst of my dejection, I 

thought back to Einstein’s words. 
The U-M data hasn’t been entirely 
encouraging 
for 
our 
futures. 

Coupled with the fact that flu season 
is fast approaching and that we’re 
going to be spending more time 
indoors because of the weather, 
how “insane” would it be for the 
University to continue housing 
undergraduates?

Yes, the administration’s choice 

means I’ll be studying at home for 
the entirety of my freshman year. 
However, I’m not a gambler; I’d 
rather wait and safely preserve my 
peers’ lives — as well as my own — 
until we receive a vaccine (which 
we have reason to believe is on its 
way). Therefore, I think Schlissel 
and the administration made the 
correct call. It’s the latest episode in 
a series of unpopular but righteous 
decisions. 

To those who remain skeptical: 

What would be a better alternative? 
By allowing undergraduate housing 
in January, you’re delaying the 
most difficult part of the situation, 
which happens to be what first-

years are about to encounter. The 
administration’s resolution is the 
equivalent of ripping a Band-Aid off; 
it’s inevitable, so you may as well do it 
quickly and avoid a slow, painful peel. 

In fact, we’re in such a dire 

situation as a state that Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer is prying off 
a second Band-Aid and picking at 
a scab that should have scarred in 
June. If Schlissel and his team had 
not made this call, Whitmer’s order 
would have had the same effect. 
There is a question of maturity for us 
as students: Are we able to take this 
pandemic seriously as we transition 
to full-on adulthood? If we’re being 
honest with ourselves, we know the 
answer. We’re stubborn by nature; 
we have always wanted normalcy 
since the pandemic first struck, no 
matter how gravely dangerous the 
price. If we cannot make the sound 
choice ourselves, we must trust our 
leaders to minimize the ensuing 
damage.

From here on, we must trudge 

along and embrace the uncertainty 
of our situation. While it may not be 
the only solution, it is the best one 
for us, whether we appreciate it or 
not. Living and studying at home is 
unappealing, but it can be done. In 
fact,you might enjoy it more than 
you think. To those of you who were 
lucky enough to find off-campus 
housing: Take one for the team and 
don’t screw this up for the rest of us. 

In the meantime, to fully enjoy 

the “college experience” we’ve 
been so desperately searching for, 
we must follow in the steps of the 
administration by thinking with our 
heads and not our hearts. We cannot 
afford to be insane.

D

ear 
President 
Donald 

Trump, 

You have continuously 

touted 
your 
administration’s 

response to the pandemic. In an 
ABC News town hall, you claimed 
to have no regrets. In fact, you have 
gone as far as to say that you rate 
your 
administration’s 
pandemic 

response a 10 out of 10. It seems that 
a “thank you” is in order from the 
United States’ college students for 
this great COVID-19 response you 
implemented. 

Thanks to your downplaying 

the virus’s lethality and danger, 
Americans who trust you have 
refused to live in fear of the virus, 
breaking 
social 
distancing 

guidelines and contributing to the 
spread of the virus. While you were 
taped privately acknowledging 
that the virus is “deadly stuff” on 
Feb. 7, you said the next month that 
“this is a flu” and “it’s very mild.” 

Even in July, after COVID-19 

had taken over 130,000 American 
lives, you claimed that 99% of 
COVID-19 
cases 
are 
“totally 

harmless.” While 99% of people 
may survive the virus, 15% of cases 
are considered severe and 5% are 
considered critical. There are also 
long-term effects that are yet to 
be understood and studied. Now, 
at my university alone, there have 
been over 2,500 cases of COVID-
19. These students were told that 
they were practically immune 
to the virus by their president. 
I speak for my friends whom I 
witnessed receive positive tests, 
then struggle to breathe and talk, 
lose their senses of taste and smell, 
fall behind in school and now fear the 
possible long-term effects that young 
people are not immune to. 

Thanks to your claims that the 

virus 
will 
magically 
disappear, 

Americans lived normally under the 
assumption that it would just go away. 
On May 8, you claimed “This is going 
to go away without a vaccine. ... We 
are not going to see it again.” On May 
8, the country was averaging 26,544 
cases a day. Now, in mid-November, 
the United States averages 164,000 
cases a day. Does it seem that this 
pandemic has disappeared “like a 
miracle” to you? 

Early on, Americans could have 

taken this virus more seriously and 
slowed down the spread. However, 
you, the leader of our nation, decided 
to blatantly lie in an attempt to make 
everything appear as if it was under 
control. This virus could have been 
controlled by the beginning of the 
semester. Instead, college campuses 
across the nation were overwhelmed 
with thousands of students arriving 
from hotspots and high-risk states. It 
was a disaster waiting to happen. 

Thanks to your rush to open the 

economy, even as deaths and cases 
increased exponentially, students 
returning to school faced an extremely 
unsafe semester. On March 25, you 
said, “the faster we go back, the better 
it’s going to be.” Public health experts 
disagreed and claimed that pulling 
back social distancing guidelines so 
soon did not provide enough time for 
them to fully work.

It is important that the government 

reopen parts of the economy and 
do what it can to protect businesses 
and workers. However, pushing for a 
reopening without giving universities 
the funding necessary to provide 
public health informed semesters 
ensured that college campuses across 
the country would become massive 
hotspots. 

Underscored 
by 
your 

stigmatization of wearing one, 
masks have not been accepted 
or embraced as necessary by 
many Americans. On April 3, 
you explained that you did not 
want to wear a face mask when 
you greeted leaders from other 
nations. You spent the beginning 
months 
of 
the 
pandemic 

questioning 
the 
effectiveness 

of masks and refusing to be 
photographed in one. Even once 
you began acknowledging that 
people should wear masks, you 
continued 
to 
send 
different 

messages to the American people. 
On Aug. 13, you said “maybe 
they’re great, and maybe they’re 
just good. Maybe they’re not so 
good.”

Your inability to set a good 

example 
for 
Americans 
and 

wear a mask, even when science 
has repeatedly pointed to its 
effectiveness, has confused the 
American people and made the 
importance of wearing masks a 
point of unnecessary controversy. 
Even 
on 
college 
campuses, 

wearing a mask at social events 
has 
not 
been 
normalized. 

Repeatedly, I have been asked by 
friends, “Why are you wearing a 
mask?” Wearing a mask around 
friends now gives the impression 
that there is a level of discomfort 
or distrust by the mask wearer. If 
the president of the United States 
is questioning the need to wear a 
mask, the people will too.

n 
the 
seminal 
classic 

“Under Pressure,” David 
Bowie 
sings 
what 
is 

perhaps the most insightful 
lyric of the 20th Century:

“Love’s 
such 
an 
old-

fashioned word and love dares 
you to care for the people on 
the edge of the night, and love 
dares you to change our way of 
caring about ourselves.” 

While it might be considered 

an overdramatization of what 
is much more often a mundane 
and 
long-winded 
process, 

Bowie’s words encapsulate that 
beautiful, singular emotional 
experience of being in love. 
That is the most remarkable 
aspect of the lyric. See, while 
most of the art promulgated by 
our mass media and prominent 
in our popular culture glorifies 
falling 
in 
love, 
this 
song 

extolls being in love, which is 
supposed to be the best part. 
This sets the song apart from 
the contemporaries we see 
today and gives it a unique, 
everlasting presence in our 
musical ethos.

Similarly, the film “Palm 

Springs” finds itself at the 
crossroads 
of 
a 
traditional 

Hallmark 
rom-com 
and 

“Groundhog Day,” yet it is 
best described as a treatise on 
being in love. This makes the 
movie a generation-defining 
experience to which everyone 
under 35 can relate but every 
American can appreciate.

In “Palm Springs,” we are 

thrust into a world that feels 
strangely familiar, given that 
we have experienced months 
of quarantine. Andy Samberg’s 
Nyles 
— 
boyfriend 
of 
the 

bride’s best friend — is living 
in an infinite temporal loop, 
experiencing the same Nov. 9 
wedding over and over until 
one day something different 
finally 
happens; 
Cristin 

Milioti’s Sarah — sister of the 
bride — joins him, kicking off 
the real story. After the quick 
obligatory 
explanation 
of 

the loop’s “rules,” the movie 
ventures where no predecessor 
has dared. It explores the 
relationship 
between 
two 

people in a world in which 
literally nothing matters and, 
in the process, creates the 
most insightful perspective on 
romance since “Crazy, Stupid, 
Love.” 

This comes to fruition in 

the desert scene — which I 
highly recommend you watch 
before reading the remainder 
of this article. The pair, after 
getting high on mushrooms, 
spend a night together in the 
desert when Nyles explains his 
personal philosophy through 
the metaphor of a chocolate bar, 
essentially claiming that the 
past does not matter. He only 
cares about people’s actions in 
the present because everything 
else, the past, the future, is 
thin air. Then, in pushing 
back, Sarah reveals her past: 
The early divorce that scarred 
her, the impulsive decision-
making that still haunts her 
and so on, which, for the first 
time in the movie, changes 
Nyles’s 
attitude, 
forcing 

him to briefly reevaluate his 
worldview. However, tellingly, 
Nyles cannot even remember 
his own past, remarking that 
“(this feeling) drifts away just 
like they all do.” Then, the 
two toast to “pretending not to 
care,” which is just about the 
most Gen Z response to a real 
emotion.

See, for Gen Z, likely the 

most nihilistic generation, the 
world of “Palm Springs” does 
not seem so terrible. Sure, not 
being able to experience the 
future might be difficult to 
reckon with, but, honestly, our 
world has been so crazy that 
having a break is appealing. 
Take me for example.

My life began on May 5, 

2000, six months before Bush 
v. Gore, one year before 9/11 
and three years before the 
invasion of Iraq. My first 

exposure to politics was the 
election 
of 
Barack 
Obama 

amid a recession that ravaged 
communities 
worldwide, 

including 
my 
backyard 
of 

Southeast Michigan. 

From there, life has been 

a constant barrage of heart-
wrenching 
mass 
shootings, 

devastating natural disasters, 
increasingly 
dire 
warnings 

about an impending climate 
crisis, 
political 
scandals, 

gridlock and a global pandemic 
to top things off; so no, I 
need little to no drama from 
my personal relationships. I 
shiver at the mere thought of 
some public grand romantic 
gesture. I, and most of Gen 
Z, would prefer to just have 
someone stable to weather the 
storm beside me. That is the 
point of “Palm Springs”: In a 
world that means nothing, our 
interpersonal 
relationships 

mean everything.

That is why there is a 

newfound 
audience 
for 

romance movies and shows that 
dare to depict real life rather 
than the grandiose fiction of 
running through an airport. 
Instead, we propel Netflix 
originals like “To All the Boys: 
P.S. I Still Love You” and “The 
Kissing Booth 2” to the top of 
the charts, not because the 
acting is amazing — it’s not — or 
because the lead ends up with 
the right guy — she doesn’t, 
because both John Ambrose 
and Marco got screwed.

We 
watch 
these 
movies 

because we love to watch 
broken people navigating an 
increasingly 
complex 
world 

and making human mistakes. 
We love to see this journey play 
out because it is the journey 
that we are on every single 
day. In the words of Nyles from 
“Palm Springs,” we are born 
lost, but, in each other, you are 
found.

“Merry Christmas” vs. “Happy Holidays”: 

It doesn’t matter

ILANA MERMELSTEIN | COLUMN

Redefining rom-coms: Treating every day like 

it’s our last dance

G

rowing up as a Jewish kid, 
I regularly took offense 
to strangers wishing me 

a “merry Christmas” during the 
holiday season. I remember exiting 
those interactions with a scowl, 
ranting incessantly to my parents 
about how “they don’t know that 
I celebrate Christmas” and “there 
are other holidays during this time 
of year.” 

I was right: “Merry Christmas” is 

far from the most inclusive greeting, 
and no one should assume which 
holiday somebody is celebrating 
(or even that they’re celebrating 
one). However, I frequently allowed 
this frustration to blind me from 
the reality of these interactions 
— someone was simply offering 
positive wishes for the season in 
the only way they knew how. As 
I matured, I realized my anger 
toward those wishing me a “merry 
Christmas” was only hurting myself. 
No one maliciously said these 
words, nor hoped to dim my little 
Jewish spirit as I assumed they did. 
I contributed to the divisive nature 
of the world in the time of year 
when unity is the most necessary, 
all because people said a nice thing 
to me, which just happened to be the 
wrong nice thing.

Others in the world believe 

we should only greet people with 
“merry Christmas” — that “happy 
holidays” is Christianity erasure, 
and that those of the opposing view 
have declared some kind of “War 
on Christmas” by using a more 
inclusive greeting. I, however, only 
choose to recognize the Grinch’s 
“War on Christmas”; the one in 
the United States does not exist. 
Secularists are not perpetrating any 
“War on Christmas” by including 
religious minorities when saying 
“happy holidays,” and those who 
choose to say “merry Christmas” 
as opposed to “happy holidays” are 
not imposing their religious beliefs, 
only offering well-wishes in the way 
they’ve been taught. If you choose 
to internally (or externally) punish 
someone for greeting you with 
positive wishes for the season, you 

may just be looking for a reason to 
get angry, and you’re likely hurting 
yourself in the process.

According to Bill O’Reilly in 

2004, who coined the term “War 
on Christmas,” the use of “happy 
holidays” by large retailers to 
substitute 
“merry 
Christmas” 

foreshadowed secularist America’s 
plot to destroy religion and push 
a 
progressive 
political agenda. 

Though religion has not since 
been 
destroyed, 
involvement 

with 
religion 
has 
indisputably 

decreased as time has progressed. 
The results of a Gallup poll 
indicate that the percentage of the 
American population identifying 
with Christianity has dropped by 
14% between 2004 and 2019, and 
the percentage of the population 
not identifying with any religion 
has increased by 12% in the same 
timespan. 

However, if the goal of reducing 

religious involvement was to push 
the progressive agenda, it certainly 
has not been achieved. O’Reilly 
cited “gay marriage, partial birth 
abortion, euthanasia, (and) legalized 
drugs” as examples of progressive 
ideals in an areligious America. The 
United States has since legalized 
same-sex marriage on a national 
level, but many states continue to 
restrict abortion and most states 
list physician-assisted suicide as 
illegal, while marijuana is still illegal 
recreationally in many states.

Furthermore, another Gallup 

poll indicates that around 93% of 
Americans claimed to celebrate 
Christmas in 2019, which is only 
approximately 
3% 
lower 
than 

the percentage reported in 2004. 
Given that only 67% of people 
identified with Christianity in 
2019, these results indicate that 
around 26% of those who celebrate 
Christmas aren’t even Christian. 
The 
“destruction” 
of 
religion 

following the replacement of “merry 
Christmas” with “happy holidays” 
has not instituted the progressive 
agenda as O’Reilly believed it would, 
and it has not been associated 
with a significant reduction in the 

percentage of those who celebrate 
Christmas. My understanding is 
that the secularization of the U.S. 
has almost nothing to do with the 
celebration of Christmas, so the 
alleged “War on Christmas” simply 
does not exist.

However, those who say “happy 

holidays” aren’t completely off the 
hook, specifically those who, like 
I once did, take offense to being 
wished a “merry Christmas.” The 
26% deviation between those who 
identify as Christian and those who 
celebrate Christmas indicates two 
things. First, a stranger who says 
“merry Christmas” to ten people 
will likely be successful with nine, 
given that 93% of people report 
that they celebrate Christmas, and 
only one will have the potential 
to take offense to the statement. 
However, if the stranger says 
“happy holidays” to ten people, 
they include all ten with the 
neutral statement, but multiple of 
the nine may believe in the “War 
on Christmas” and take offense to 
the statement. The stranger is more 
likely to offend fewer people by 
saying “merry Christmas.”

Second, if 26% of those who 

celebrate Christmas do not identify 
as Christian, it can be argued that 
the celebration of Christmas does 
not have to be a religious institution 
at all. In 2017, a Pew Research Center 
poll indicated that, though 90% of 
Americans celebrated Christmas, 
less than half viewed it as a religious 
holiday. If someone wishes you a 
“merry Christmas,” it is more likely 
than not that they simply hope you 
eat lots of chocolate and have a good 
day on December 25.

A

s I was setting up the 
recording session for my 
brother Michael’s graduate 

school audition, I heard the familiar 
sound of a jazz trio warming up. 
Warm tones from the trombone were 
met with thumping bass and bright 
piano. While these sounds were 
familiar, the circumstances were 
anything but. Usually these sessions 
are small and intimate with players 
close together to communicate — 
12 feet apart and masked certainly 
was a strange change of scene. As I 
was setting up, I couldn’t help but 
think that as music, the gig economy 
and the world have changed over 
the years, music education at the 
University of Michigan’s School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance … hasn’t. At 
least not at the rate it needs to keep up 
with the rest of the world.

To put the antiquated nature 

of 
some 
of 
SMTD’s 
course 

requirements into perspective, every 
undergraduate at SMTD must take 
at least two semesters of written and 
aural music theory while many, like 
myself, have to take at least two full 
years. The primary focus of these 
first two semesters of theory are 
counterpoint, a musical technique for 
combining melodic lines developed 
in the 9th century, and figured bass, 
a technique for harmonic structure 
developed in the 17th century. After 
asking a Theory Graduate Student 
Instructor my freshman year why we 
are required to learn these techniques 
from the rather distant musical past, 
I was met with a laugh and a simple 
acknowledgement that at this point, 
it’s tradition, and we’re one of maybe 
three music schools that still do this. 
Not a particularly satisfying answer 
when paying out-of-state tuition for 

an effectively irrelevant course 

requirement. 

You may be wondering, how is 

a technique from the 9th or 17th 
century at all relevant to any non-
classical major at the school? The 
simple answer is that it isn’t. Beyond 
reinforcing a sense of Western music 
supremacy arguably tied to white 
supremacy, the course does little 
to help non-classical composition 
majors at the University. 

Anna Rosengart, an SMTD and 

LSA senior, reflected on many of 
these required music theory and 
history classes, saying, “newsflash: 
white Western music isn’t the 
only music, and madrigals and 
symphonies aren’t the only way to 

study it. … I wish we learned about 
other ways to be musical in the ‘real 
world’ and could get more exposure.” 
SMTD needs to move past tired 
curriculum requirements to address 
societal and educational realities.

University alum Mohan Ritsema, 

a jazz bass player, expressed his 
frustration with antiquated aspects 
of the curriculum taking the space of 
basic skills and lessons that should be 
taught. 

“Something I’ve always felt about 

U-M, that I especially feel now, is 
that it’s messed up. U-M requires 
everyone to learn figured bass but not 
how to use the producing software 
Logic. We have to take two years of 
classical piano but never learn how 
to set up a microphone. I think now, 
that is really starting to bite people,” 
Ritsema said. 

Requiring students to take classes 

like these is a waste of time and 
money when students aren’t learning 
skills that will allow them to succeed 
or sustain themselves in the future. 
Unless students are going into music 
theory, knowing figured bass won’t 
put food on the table. But knowing 
the basics of sound production or 
self-promotion may be the difference 
between making it or breaking it in 
the music industry.

University alum Brendan Davis, a 

pianist, said he wishes “we had had 
marketing classes at SMTD.” While 
Davis has continued to have gigs 
during the pandemic, having self-
marketing or business skills as part 
of the core curriculum for SMTD 
students would help others translate 
artistic skills into economic security. 

“I know many musicians who have 

had to retire or step away from music 
due to COVID. … Learning stuff like 
self-marketing would’ve been really 
helpful.” As the music industry has 
changed across the board both due 
to the market and recently COVID-
19, institutions must change to teach 
students how to succeed and survive 
with their craft, not just the origins of 
a distantly related musical language 
or history.

SMTD has examples it can and 

should follow in-house. Programs 
like EXCEL Lab at SMTD provide 
students 
both 
coursework 
and 

workshops about the music industry, 
music entrepreneurship, social media 
and other relevant topics. SMTD 
should cut other undergraduate 
course requirements and make these 
courses required. If students want 

to pursue topics like medieval music 
history or theory, they are welcome 
to do so, but shouldn’t be required 
to. 
While 
these 
opportunities 

theoretically exist for students, both 
Ritsema, Davis and I haven’t able 
to utilize them during our time at 
Michigan due to the number of other, 
irrelevant course requirements we 
have to satisfy.

“Generational gaps in technology 

definitely exist,” Ritsema said about 
the faculty and administration. 
He went on to say that there is a 
general sentiment among faculty 
and students that something more is 
needed, but they are not sure what. I 
urge students to communicate with 
the administration about student 
needs. However, I more strongly urge 
the administration to look around at 
the holes that need to be filled in our 
education, now more than ever. We 
can’t afford to graduate from SMTD 
without a better core curricular 
foundation in how to operate as a 
musician, no matter how artistically 
skilled we may be.

If there was ever a time to 

modernize SMTD, it must be now, as 
the floor has fallen out for musicians 
worldwide. Broadway’s doors are 
closed until at least May 30, 2021, 
indoor performance venues are 
closed in Michigan and across the 
United States due to actions like 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s COVID-19 
orders and in-person music education 
has been greatly affected at schools 
like SMTD. 

As musicians fight to survive in 

the ailing industry, it is apparent 
that it isn’t their required studies 
in medieval musicology or theory 
that are helping them survive, but 
their ability to setup livestream 
concerts, busk, self-promote, write 
grants and find virtual gigs; all 
necessary skills that aren’t reflected 
in SMTD’s course requirements. 
SMTD must modernize to address 
both COVID-19 and education in the 
21st century, providing a teaching 
based on educational effectiveness, 
not Western music supremacy or 
antiquated tradition. 

“Even 
without 
COVID,” 
as 

Ritsema said, “these were things 
everyone needs to know. These are 
the skills that you need in the 21st 
century if you want to make it as a real 
professional musician.”

W

hat is the first image that 
comes to your mind when you 
think of TikTok? Is it Charli 

D’Amelio and her friends dancing to a viral 
song? Or is it half-naked white boys jamming 
to hip hop music? While these may be the 
most common associations of TikTok, the 
platform has many more sides to it than just 
the content of attractive young people doing 
silly dances and pranks. Many young TikTok 
users were responsible for tanking a Trump 
rally in Tulsa in June by reserving tickets and 
not showing up for the event, something they 
organized through the app. In September, a 
TikTok creator collective, Tok the Vote, was 
founded to promote voter registration in the 
2020 election. 

Over the past two years, TikTok has ex-

panded its influence in the United States and 
has become a crucial information outlet for 
Generation Z as well as a major platform for 
young activists to share their ideas and to ex-
pose injustices. This has even occurred here 
at the University of Michigan. In early Sep-
tember, LSA junior Sam Burnstein depicted 
the poor conditions of University quarantine 
housing in a TikTok. Another student ex-
pressed through a TikTok her frustrations 
with the administration’s poor COVID-19 
precautions and the then-ongoing strikes 
within the University. Both of their videos 
quickly went viral and drew the attention 
of several major media outlets. TikTok has 
proved itself as much more than merely an 
entertainment app, but rather a platform 
where young people can make their voices 
easily heard by tens of thousands or even 
millions of people. 

So, what is TikTok’s magic? In August, 

Instagram, now owned by Facebook, Inc., in-
troduced a new feature called Reels, which 
allows users to shoot and edit short video 
clips that are nearly identical to the experi-
ence of TikTok. Snapchat has also recently 
presented its own take on short-form vid-
eos, Spotlight. While Reels has already been 
dubbed as a copycat of TikTok, it is also un-
likely that Snapchat’s version of it will be 
able to replicate TikTok’s mainstream suc-
cess.

The secret to TikTok’s success is rather 

simple: the algorithm. By relying on a very 
complex set of indicators, TikTok’s algo-
rithm lands people into communities of very 
specific interests, which often leads the us-
ers to have some form of self-discovery or 
growth while they descend deeper into the 
app’s rabbit hole. Gen Z lesbians have found 
love through bonding on Alt TikTok and 
WitchTok. A YouTube influencer known as 
“bestdressed” admitted in a video that she 
had a revelation about her sexuality after the 
algorithm immediately placed her in “bi girl 
TikTok.” Public health experts also use the 
app to bring awareness to COVID-19 precau-
tions, and teachers join the platform to give 
tips to students experiencing trouble with 
virtual education. The algorithm has made 
it possible for both mainstream and niche 
communities to exist simultaneously by al-
most exclusively sending catered content to 
the user’s “For You” page. 

Indeed, with the existence of such a di-

verse array of users and communities, Tik-
Tok has transformed itself into a combina-
tion of a “how-to” guide database, Vine 2.0, 
a condensed version of Khan Academy and a 
dating app for Gen Z. Recently, TikTok also 
announced that it is in the process of test-
ing a new “Learn” tab on the app to show-
case educational and instructional content. 
It is clear that TikTok is no longer that app 
where creators post only funny videos and 
viral dances, but rather, it is an online space 
where people connect through monthly 
trends and sometimes share meaningful con-
versations about sociopolitical issues. 

***
LSA freshman Alan Yang went viral on 

TikTok during the summer. During our 

phone conversation, he said that he uses Tik-
Tok for about two to three hours a day, but 
he confessed that over the summer, during 
lockdown in California, he spent almost six 
hours on TikTok every single day. Through 
his one viral TikTok, Yang has gained more 
than 2,000 followers already, most of whom 
he does not know but took an interest in his 
daily life. He deeply appreciated the im-
mense power of TikTok to create a safe and 
close-knit community, especially during 
such an isolating time.

“When I am meeting someone new for the 

first time, just talking about TikTok is such 
a great bonding point,” Yang explained. “It 
is definitely a safe space where I am able to 
connect with my followers and community. 
It’s something that I really love and cherish, 
(a space) where I can just be myself.”

In addition to a fun community, Yang also 

sees TikTok as a learning platform. The vid-
eos that pop up on his FYP range from gen-
eral fashion tips to class recommendations at 
the University. Yang also recalled a trend in 
recent months targeted toward high school 
students, where creators make college in-
troduction videos in a specific format about 
dorms, food, classes and so on.

“If I were a high schooler, I would have 

found (the videos) super useful,” Yang stat-
ed. “Since there is no campus tour because of 
COVID, TikTok becomes this learning plat-
form (for students applying to college).”

Yang was not the only one who benefited 

from TikTok’s variety of content. LSA junior 
and pre-med student Emery Hakim down-
loaded the app this past summer to watch 
food and dance videos in her spare time, but 
the algorithm eventually led her to science 
and pre-med related videos. Through this 
scrolling, she found and signed up for a vir-
tual shadowing program where she learned 
how to do case work usually done in medical 
school.

“I joined (TikTok) because it was some-

thing that everyone had and it was just kind 
of a stupid thing to kill time,” Hakim ex-
plained. “But then I ended up finding really 
useful information about med school, the 
MCAT and volunteer opportunities.”

Being on TikTok also reaffirmed Hakim’s 

passions for medicine as a career. She discov-
ered the account Institute of Human Anato-
my during quarantine, which she found both 
informational and fascinating. She said she 
finds it comforting to know that she will be 
able to learn something interesting in medi-
cal school rather than being stuck in physics 
and organic chemistry classes.

“Being pre-med at Michigan is really dif-

ficult, and a lot of (what I learn) does not ap-
ply to what medical school is actually like,” 
Hakim stated. “Learning more about what 
doctors actually do on a day-to-day basis is 
really exciting for me.” 

As practical tips and knowledge thrive 

on the platform, many have begun using 
TikTok as a professional platform to pro-
mote their own businesses and services. 
The hashtag “#tips” has 19.3 billion views 
on TikTok whereas “#resume” has 126.2 
million views. Professionals from all fields, 
including business, medicine, restaurant 
and tech, have all joined the platform to 
share their insights through 30-second 
videos.

“#Cooking” has more than 25 billion 

views on TikTok, and LSA sophomore Kyle 
Nash was one of the many people who ben-
efited from this source. During quarantine, 
Nash found himself clueless about how to 
make food for himself and his roommate. 
Though he never considered a TikTok a 
traditional platform to get beginner reci-
pes and cooking tips, he came across a few 
videos which he found very useful. It has 
been a valuable journey for Nash, since he 
has gone from not knowing how to cook at 
all to being able to experiment with differ-
ent dishes.

“With YouTube and other platforms, I 

would kind of have to look for (the videos), 
whereas TikTok just showed it to me and it 
wasn’t something I had to go out of my way 
to find,” Nash explained. “The fact that (Tik-
Tok) is so tailored to each individual person 
makes it a really great outlet for informa-
tion.”

Unlike others I spoke with, Nash only 

spends about 15 minutes on TikTok every 
day, and was shocked to learn that many are 
so addicted to the app. Indeed, users spend 
an average of 46 minutes a day on TikTok 
and open the app eight times a day. The con-
tent on TikTok is always rapidly changing, 
with new trends being created almost week-
ly. Furthermore, the concise nature of the 
medium also facilitates the instant absorp-
tion of information.

Julie Albright, a sociologist from the Uni-

versity of Southern California, compared the 
consumption of these short-form videos to 
“drugging ourselves.” According to Albright, 
the active usage of these addictive platforms 
changes how our brains perceive time and 
thus drastically reduces our attention spans. 
Nevertheless, while most of our generation 
acknowledges such harmful effects, there 
seems to be no intention or effort to ulti-
mately get off the app.

“I think (our shortening attention span) is 

awful. I am a part of it and TikTok definitely 
reinforces it,” Hakim said with a light chuck-
le. “It will definitely hurt our generation that 
we can’t pay attention to things for more 
than 20 seconds. But it’s okay … for now!” 

***
Political expressions on TikTok are quite 

diverse. On one hand, you have Marxist col-
lege students with their trendy turtlenecks 
who make videos debunking the mud pie 
theory and celebrating Angela Davis; on 
the other hand, there are also many young 
people who unapologetically show off the 
Trump 2020 flag in their room. 

TikTok was also a major platform used at 

the height of Black Lives Matter protests this 
past summer. Under the hashtag “#black-
livesmatter,” which has exceeded 20 billion 
views, Black creators explain systemic rac-
ism while many also share tips on how to 
protest safely. However, it is also populated 
with irrelevant videos that are obviously ex-
ploiting the hashtag for its popularity.

Engineering sophomore Rachel Pastori 

expressed her appreciation for political 
TikTok. According to Pastori, creators of-
ten took their differences and conversations 
outside of TikTok to YouTube or Twitch in 
the format of debate. Streamed six months 
ago, Harry Sission and Ashleigh Mae repre-
senting the liberals and Treyton Shriver and 
Kaden Duff representing the conservatives 
took part in a debate. All of these creators 
are young: Treyton is just 14 years old, while 
Harry is 18. 

Pastori explained that she felt a sense 

of empowerment listening to these young 
people speak, rather than reading articles 
by adults who are much older than she is. 
Though she does not identify as a Republi-
can, she finds it enlightening that TikTok is a 
platform that is inclusive of diverse political 
views.

“Sometimes, I go on TikTok after news 

comes out; I just wanna see other people’s 
points of views,” Pastori explained. “It’s re-
ally nice to see other people my age or older 
than me posting about the election or gen-
eral U.S. politics.”

In addition to watching young creators 

sharing their political opinions and activism, 
Pastori also enjoyed the range of new ideas 
she is exposed to on TikTok. She told me that 
she saw a lot of videos about Native Ameri-
can and indigenous cultures on her FYP, 
which she found very interesting because 
she never had the opportunity to learn about 
them in school. Though she was raised Cath-
olic, Pastori is not a devout, and rather found 

a pastor on TikTok who opened her eyes to 
a new and more liberal form of Christianity. 

“A video would always come up on my 

FYP and I can learn something new,” Pas-
tori said. “On Instagram or Twitter, you can 
only really see stuff from people who you are 
following. TikTok makes (the information) 
more accessible and you are able to reach 
more people through the algorithm.”

Indeed, while many creators post under 

political hashtags to make a joke out of the 
situation or express their opinions through 
a trend, there are also ones who are dedi-
cated to sharing genuinely helpful informa-
tion. Yang told me that he found updates 
about the Graduate Employees’ Organiza-
tion strike in September almost exclusively 
through videos by creator chemcowboi, who 
gave daily updates about the then ongoing 
movement. In addition to updates about the 
GEO strike, they also share insightful advice 
about chemistry and graduate school. 

Nevertheless, both Yang and Pastori 

agreed that there is a need to take the in-
formation found on TikTok with a grain of 
salt. Since the algorithm can make anyone 
go viral, it facilitates the spread of informa-
tion, whether that information is true or 
false. Pastori clarified that a lot of creators 
use a picture of the source in the background 
of the video, and she also goes through the 
comments to see if others make objections 
to the creators’ points. Though she also does 
her own fact-checking on some of these top-
ics, Pastori admits that she does not have 
time to always research. 

“If I am suspicious about something 

that they brought up, I would go and check 
the validity of their sources,” Pastori said. 
“Sometimes their sources are slightly biased 
towards one side or outdated.”

***
In the age of information, it seems that 

every single new app that enters the market 
is trying to compete for our time and atten-
tion. Over time, as our brains become used 
to the sheer abundance of information that 
we absorb every day, we jump at the sight of 
a notification and the first thing we do when 
we wake up is grab our phones and check 
our socials. 

Many social media platforms are trying to 

diversify and rebrand themselves as “more 
than just a form of entertainment” — Twit-
ter is the app where journalists receive the 
most engagements, whereas Instagram has 
become known for its colorful, educational 
infographics. And as for TikTok — well, you 
just read about it.

Information is certainly not a bad thing. 

But learning about anti-racism by scroll-
ing through an app is vastly different from 
learning about the topic by reading a book 
or a journalistic article. While creators are 
able to offer raw experiences or opinions on 
a certain issue, there are many nuances that a 
60-second video (with no ingrained citation, 
by the way) fails to capture. No matter how 
much the app attempts to rebrand itself, it is 
simply insufficient as a learning platform.

However, TikTok can still be a valuable 

source for information. Though I do think 
that it is helpful to mention that if we are 
truly intrigued by a certain topic, learning 
shouldn’t stop at TikTok. Therefore, a con-
versation or a book can be empowering; in-
stead of mindlessly scrolling and absorbing, 
we have the agency to discern, disagree and 
contend.

Social media broadens our perspectives 

about the world, but it also narrows it. We 
only click on what we want to see and the al-
gorithm picks up the cues, so it sends to the 
FYP mostly what we are interested in and 
creators who share similar opinions as us. 
But learning isn’t about reaffirming our own 
values and seeing what we already know, it’s 
about breaking boundaries and stepping out 
of our comfort zone. While social media can-
not do that for us, real life interactions do.

Tok rabbit hole

‘A season of grief’: 
Profiles of the 
LGBTQ+ holiday 
experience

BY GRACE TUCKER, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

Wednesday, December 2, 2020 — 11 

H

ey my girl. Is there anyone you 
would like to bring home for 
Thanksgiving? Someone who 

isn’t travelling home or needs allies to have 
Thanksgiving with?”

In something like extending a hand or 

offering a warm hug, my mom sent me that 
text message on a frigid Ann Arbor after-
noon. 

When I read it, a few people came to 

mind: The friend who routinely removes 
his pride flag from his living room every 
time his parents visit. The classmate who 
mentally prepares herself to talk about 
her girlfriend like she is just a girl (space) 
friend during her family’s Thanksgiving 
dinner. The coworker who enthusiastically 
works extra shifts to dodge time at home 
and avoid being invalidated by her father, 
who, for years now, has refused to correctly 
use her pronouns. 

My parents have been self-proclaimed 

“allies” for as long as I can remember. Even 
before I started talking to them about my 
queer identity, they had a big, bright pride 
flag hanging over our garage for years — a 
bold act in an Indiana suburb. 

Like two blue sheep among a swarm of 

red ones, my parents have long been the 
sole liberal parents in my social circles. 
It was my mother who gifted me my first 
“I’m with her” T-shirt during the 2016 
election. And my father, who works as a 
middle school math teacher, who once sat 
me down to inquire how to ask for his stu-
dents’ pronouns. 

As I’ve grown up, my parents have im-

plemented this spirit of inclusion into ev-
erything they teach us, in every corner of 
our household. But seeing that text from 
my mother reminded me that too many 
people in my life — and too many other stu-
dents on campus — are not quite as lucky. 

After a handful of lovely and deeply 

compelling conversations with other stu-
dents within the LGBTQ+ community, I 
found the diversity of their backgrounds 
and identities to be reflected in the range 
of sentiment they expressed in response to 
one simple idea: “home for the holidays.” 

For some, being home meant being 

grounded, a “breath of fresh air” from the 
otherwise chaotic semester we’ve all en-
dured. And for others, being home meant 
something quite different: It meant stress, 
anxiety and having to act as a “representa-
tive” on behalf of their entire community 
when relatives became overly inquisitive. It 
meant awkward conversations in response 
to the dreaded ‘So, are you seeing anyone?’ 
question grandparents seem to pose every 
year. It meant an “experience of grief.”
T

heodore Poling, LSA Junior

“I do still use (she/her pro-

nouns) but for (my Dad), I don’t 

want him to because it’s this ... lingering 
connection to the concept of a person who 
has never existed. Like, I was never his 
daughter.”

When I realized that our interview 

had run over an hour long after talking all 
things coming out, the supposedly “con-
tradictory” nature of androgynous gender 
presentation and their father’s traditional-
ist interpretations of gender and family, I 
knew that LSA junior Theodore Poling was 
a special person with a lot to say regarding 
the intricacies of the LGBTQ+ experience. 

After transferring from the University of 

Southern California this semester, Poling 
has hit the ground running, grasping every 

opportunity they have to be involved on 
campus even while studying remotely from 
their parents’ home in Ann Arbor. Founder 
and president of the Trans and Gender-
Non-Conforming Arts Review, and mem-
ber of both BiLateral and the Ace Space 
within the Spectrum Center, they offered 
me a proud smile when they said, “I’m 
pretty well-connected in the whole queer 
world on campus.”

Though, with the holiday season ap-

proaching, Poling acknowledged that home 
is often where they encounter more points 
of conflict, one being the way their parents 
have approached their enduring health 
problems. Throughout this year, Poling has 
struggled with chronic pain in their lower 
abdominal and pelvic region, which has 
aggravated the already less-than-healthy 
relationship their dad has with their trans-
gender identity. 

“My dad is so intentionally ignorant 

about gender stuff,” they said. “He can 
grasp … trans man and trans woman, but 
anything beyond that he thinks is kind of 
fake. And so, if I bring up anything that has 
to do with like, (the fact that) I have, you 
know, a uterus, then he kind of sees it as 
like, ‘haha, checkmate ... you are not trans.’ 
So having to deal with this medical issue 
that is ... very biological in nature has been 
stressful.”

In the beginning stages of their journey 

toward embracing their nonbinary identi-
ty, Poling wanted to avoid having to “come 
out” over and over again while seeing rela-
tives over the holidays. So, they did what 
any Gen Z-er within the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity would do: They turned to Facebook. In 
the weeks leading up to the holidays, they 
made a Facebook post stating their name 
‘Theo’ and their pronouns. And with that, 
they had set the “framework” for coming 
out before grandma and grandpa came into 
town. 

In terms of coming into their gender 

identity, Poling said they have an “opposite 
story” in that, when they first came out, 
they thought, “This is going to be easier on 
people if I just say like, ‘I’m a guy now. I’m 
a trans man,’ (so as to) not have (my family) 
have to deal with ‘nonbinary’ and all that.”

Poling remembered one holiday where 

they clung on to a particularly masculine 
gender presentation.

“I let my facial hair grow out a little bit 

and I cut my hair shorter,” they said. “And 
I wore a sweater and slacks that I found in 
the men’s section of a store and (I) tried to 
like, I don’t know, downshift my voice a lit-
tle bit. I just didn’t want (relatives) to, like 
my Dad, ask questions that have such big 
answers, you know?”

Now, after having come into their non-

binary identity, Poling has been able to re-
flect on what’s at stake when a cisgender 
person fails to fully embrace a transgender 
person’s identity.

“... If someone hasn’t come out as trans, 

and you say something transphobic, they’re 
gonna stay in the closet around you ... and 
(what if ) you found out 30 years later that 
you never got to meet that part of their life 
... wouldn’t you feel some sort of grief?”
N

ikolas Zazula, LSA Senior

“I feel like most queer peo-

ple kind of experience the same 

thing, (where you’re) spending so much time 
overthinking the way you present mostly be-
cause you’re ... worried about ... the way oth-
er people are going to interpret that. That 

anxiety ... for queer people is always there.”

Through our brief phone conversation, 

I quickly gathered that LSA senior Nikolas 
Zazula carries a cool and confident perso-
na. In between spurts of Zazula’s laughter, 
we spent the interview talking about the 
“weirdness” of sexuality, the struggles of 
being a Gemini and the joys of having an 
open, supportive family. 

Zazula said he’s fortunate to never have 

had to come out to his family. “They all 
kind of just let me do my thing,” he told me.

And because his family has always been 

very accepting of his identity, he knows 
how he chooses to present himself in front 
of them is “not a big deal.” He further elab-
orated, explaining, “... It’s less that I’m un-
comfortable and more that I don’t care too 
much, and I kind of just make them deal 
with it.”

As a drag performer in the Ann Arbor 

and Metro Detroit areas, Zazula has had 
lots of practice “doing his thing,” and be-
ing his true self regardless of other peo-
ple’s perceptions of him. When asked how 
his presentation might shift while with 
extended family during the holidays, Za-
zula breezily responded, “I wouldn’t really 
be too concerned about navigating other 
people’s conceptions of what I should look 
like.”
P

arker Kehrig, LSA Junior

“I really wish that the culture 

of my family, my various families, 

wasn’t the way that it is because ... there’s 
so many of us ... there’s no way I’m the only 
(queer person). There’s absolutely no way ... 
just based on how statistics works.” 

Even while expressing the heavy and 

sometimes exhausting reality he’s lived be-
ing the sole openly genderqueer and gay 
person in his entire extended family, LSA 
junior Parker Kehrig spent our interview 
flexing his warm conversation skills and 
flare for comedic timing.

When asked if he could be quoted using 

his name, Kehrig burst with enthusiasm. 

“You can absolutely put me using my 

name. There’s already enough on the inter-
net about what a raging queer I am.”

When asked about his coming out ex-

perience, Kehrig says he came out as a gay 
person when he was 16, then as gender-
queer when he was 18. And, ever-playful in 
the ways he candidly talks about his queer 
experience, he considers his queer presen-
tation now to be “kind of an open secret” 
to his family. 

Though, Kehrig remembers when he 

first presented as genderqueer in front of 
his family for the holidays and exclaimed 
to me, “It was terrifying. It was so scary.” 
He laughed again and continued, “I was 
really trying to dress in a way that made 
me feel more comfortable. And I started 
layering sweaters over button-downs, and 
(thought), ‘I’m just a little bit preppy,’ but 
it was never preppy — it was very queer-
looking.”

Kehrig comes from a large family; his 

parents are divorced, and his step-dad’s 
parents are divorced as well, so he can visit 
up to five houses on one holiday. And with 
seeing all of these family members, Keh-
rig has had many conversations about is-
sues surrounding the LGBTQ+ community. 
But, in his experience, they never resem-
ble topics like one of his family members 
“not knowing how to explain lesbianism” 
to their kid. To that, Kehrig said he would 
love to engage in those sorts of community 

education-oriented conversations. 

Instead, he said conversations with rela-

tives often run along the lines of being told, 
“‘Defend your own humanity — go!” or 
“Defend your existence — go!’”

Kehrig reflects on the amount of “igno-

rant shit” he’s had to hear during political 
conversations over the holidays. Specifi-
cally, Kehrig offered the example of at-
tempting to explain systemic racism to a 
group of particularly hard-headed fam-
ily members. And with this, Kehrig said to 
have struggled most with teaching his rela-
tives that “just because (something) is out 
of your realm of the way you perceive the 
world, doesn’t mean it is nonexistent.”

“And a world outside of you exists. And 

it is beautiful. And if anyone is ever try-
ing to take your hand and pull you into it 
and show you what it is, you better fuck-
ing thank them. Because that is labor. Like, 
that is so much emotional labor.”
A

nna Pasek, Engineering Senior

“... it’s just kind of a situation 

where I’m still dependent on my 

family, you know, like, financially and a lot 
of other forms of support. And so ... I have to, 
like, kind of think twice before I express my 
queerness in a certain way. Because, other-
wise my livelihood could be compromised.”

Careful in the ways she disclosed in-

formation about the unsteady nature of 
her home, Engineering senior Anna Pasek 
showed a brave vulnerability when talking 
about her experiences as a queer woman. 
With her Zoom profile dimly lit by the win-
dows of her partner’s home, she opened up 
about her coming out experience, present-
ing queer in her childhood home, and navi-
gating holidays with family versus with 
friends, among other things. 

Pasek started our conversation by say-

ing that, pre-pandemic, she chose to spend 
breaks with people you could call her “cho-
sen family.” 

During this time, she would run Thanks-

giving 5K marathons and spend time with 
friends she has known for years — she even 
made a habit out of eating Thanksgiving 
breakfast at her friend’s house. But, she 
still feels unsure about making these kinds 
of traditions. 

“I just feel weird about (how) that’s oth-

er people’s space to be with their families,” 
Pasek said. “And, like, I don’t want to di-
minish that or take from that even though I 
know I’ve been offered a place at the table.”

In regards to her coming out experience, 

Pasek said she “got kind of pushed out of 
the closet by (her) parents” her senior year 
of high school, after they stole her phone 
and found she had a partner at the time. 
Since then, she believes her parents are 
slowly “getting better” about accepting her 
queer identity; however, she knows main 
events during the holidays remain manda-
tory for her family.

“It’s just a case of bringing up livelihood 

and financial security. If I were to not show 
up at home for Thanksgiving (dinner), that 
would make really big problems for me.”

Pasek said that if she had one word to 

describe the queer holiday experience, it 
would be grief.

“(Queer people) don’t have uncondi-

tional love to take for granted, really,” Pas-
ek said. “And our families are often in love 
with an idea of who we could be and not 
who we are. And that is something that is 
painful, and (something) that you have to 
confront every time you go home.”

S

o, do you want me to buy a share 
of a water buffalo or a flock of 
chicks?” my friend Kat asked me 

as we discussed what we wanted for the 
upcoming holiday season. After a few min-
utes of searching the internet, we some-
how ended up on the website of Heifer In-
ternational, a global nonprofit that aims to 
provide livestock and services to farmers. 

According to their website, a donation 

of $25 provides a tenth of a water buffalo 
to help farmers plow their fields. For $20, 
they can provide a family with the ability 
to produce eggs to eat and sell. 

There are countless charities like Heif-

er International, as there are countless 
causes we can donate to. Though there 
is research and philosophical debate on 
which causes we should prioritize and 
what organizations and interventions are 
most effective, there is no consensus for 
consumers to take to the bank. This is a 
concept I’ve thought about and struggled 
with before as a result of enrolling in Phil 
250: From Climate Change to Poverty, I 
don’t know which causes have the great-
est need on the grand scale of world issues 
and further, what each organization can 
do with a small donation. As a society, we 
lack the necessary information and time 
to determine which causes are most effec-
tive. There are no red flags on websites of 
ineffective charities directing donors to 
superior ones and the information avail-
able requires dedication and certain skills 
to purposely sift through it (though there 
are efforts to solve this problem, such as 
givewell.org 
and 
charitynavigator.org). 

Even with the necessary information, we 
would require value judgements to deter-
mine which causes should have the utmost 
priority. However, I do know that whatev-
er a small donation accomplishes for any 
charity will do more good than the gifting 
of another fuzzy blanket or tie dye sweat-
shirt. 

Looking at the current state of the world 

through the lens of my 19th holiday season, 
it is easy to wonder why we buy and receive 
gifts we do not want or need. We could 
skip participating in Secret Santa at the of-
fice and instead send life-saving medical 
care to a child in need. People around the 
world are facing utter destitution, and we 

continue to make frivolous purchases of 
cheap jewelry and holiday scented lotions. 
The fact these decisions are made every 
day, when we drop by Starbucks and buy 
products glorified by TikTok, makes this a 
daily dilemma, though perhaps even more 
so considering the increase in superfluous 
spending during the holiday season. This 
year, our consumption could easily be put 
under more intense levels of scrutiny con-
sidering the exacerbation of hunger and 
homelessness the pandemic has caused in 
the United States alone, in addition to the 
global consequences of COVID-19. 

All things considered, finding a palat-

able level of generosity is extremely diffi-
cult, on both a personal and societal level 
— intellectuals have debated this issue for 
decades. Philosopher Peter Singer pro-
posed in a paper published in 1972, “Fam-
ine, Affluence and Morality,” that we have 
a moral obligation to donate every pos-
sible dollar until we are in a similar state 
of those we are donating to, or must sacri-
fice something of moral importance in or-
der to donate. Though many find Singer’s 
standard for moral righteousness in terms 
of charity too extreme, it is staggering that 
we participate in any unnecessary and un-
fulfilling gift-giving in light of the grandi-
osity of the world’s problems and the fact 
we can easily do something about them. 

These ideas, combined with my enroll-

ment in Philosophy 250 — a course that 
studies the effectiveness of aid interven-
tions and attempts to determine those 
which we ought to prioritize — has made 
me question my typical methods of gift-
giving. 
W

hy do we give gifts in the first 
place? To show our love, our 
affection or the effort we put 

into relationships and valuing the people 
in our lives? If that’s the case, wouldn’t a 
heartfelt note or gesture be sufficient? Is 
the point of gifting to provide things for 
people that they have great use or need 
for, that they would not have otherwise? If 
that’s the case, how have we come to buy 
people their 14th pair of boots and niche 
kitchen gadgets?

The practice of gift-giving has been 

dramatically altered by the commercial-
ization of holidays and the transition into 

a consumer-driven society, regardless of 
whether these causes are inspired by com-
modities becoming cheaper, people spend-
ing more, people having more money or a 
combination of multigenerational factors. 
As a result of the changing culture, many 
of us find ourselves buying unneeded, 
unwanted gifts due to the idea that con-
suming and gifting something is an easier, 
safer option than having slightly difficult, 
awkward conversations about thought-
ful, meaningful generosity and kindness. 
Gifting during holidays, birthdays, retire-
ments and graduations is complicated by 
unclear obligations, confusing expecta-
tions and conflicting affirmations that in-
dividuals tie to receiving and giving gifts. 
We ask ourselves whether we should bring 
gifts to our partner’s parents when com-
ing over for holiday dinner and worry 
about the message not bringing a candle 
or a bottle of wine could send. We have 
difficulties discussing spending limits on 
gifts with people that are relatively new, 
albeit important, in our lives, if we want 
to purchase them a gift in the first place. 
To no avail, “Friends,” “Gossip Girl,” “The 
Big Bang Theory” and other shows have 
comedically explored the conundrums of 
whether or not to buy, what to buy and 
how much to spend in an hour or less, usu-
ally leaving us with more questions than 
we started with. 

Regardless of these complexities, the 

fact remains that the holiday season pres-
ents some of us with the opportunity to do 
good, whether it be with our purchasing 
power or our time. In fact, the holidays 
may look very different for millions of 
Americans and thousands of college stu-
dents this year, considering the financial 
repercussions of the pandemic. We ought 
to ask ourselves the tough questions when 
it comes to the annual splurge on those 
closest to us and reflect when people ask 
what we are wishing for.

If we do decide to purchase gifts, we 

ought to consider what to buy and where 
to buy it from. Should we avoid Amazon 
and look local? Is it mandatory to purchase 
from a company with sustainable and fair-
trade practices, one with philanthropic 
initiatives, instead of from whatever com-
pany provides free shipping or the lowest 

total price? 

Looking toward the holidays, I ask my-

self these questions while acknowledging 
my family and I are extremely lucky to not 
need groceries, a rent cut or new clothes. 
If I do decide to purchase gifts, buying 
from a company that pays its employees 
a living wage and uses recycled materi-
als, carbon-offset shipping and fair labor 
practices is the only option I can defend. 
However, I know my mom does not need 
another pair of earrings to clutter her van-
ity and my dad does not need another flan-
nel to cram in his closet. To them, agreeing 
to a marathon of Westerns I cannot stand 
or organizing my mom’s cassette collec-
tion is likely a greater expression of love 
and gratitude than anything I could buy. 
For my sister, who is in pursuit of a Ph.D., 
I plan on writing a note of encouragement 
complete with a reimbursement for her 
application to her dream school. In normal 
times, spending time together or volun-
teering with friends would create memo-
ries worth more than a gift card. This year, 
I hope to plan something my friends and I 
can safely enjoy in the spirit of the season. 
Though I love gorgeous, gold wrapping 
paper and the way my mom ties her bows, 
meaningful acts of thoughtfulness, charity 
and generosity make a much more beau-
tiful holiday scene to me than mounds of 
packages under our tree.

There may be a fine line between cau-

tious consumption and overthinking it, 
there may be an answer to the decision 
of whether to consume or donate. And if 
there is, I have not found it in Philosophy 
250, nor have I found it in personal pur-
suits, and it is highly unlikely I will by my 
final exam or even by the time I graduate. 
All I can do to move forward each day, and 
through this holiday season, is critically 
consider the countless social, philosophi-
cal and ethical questions that manifest in 
decisions concerning my purchasing pow-
er. 

At the end of the day, or rather at the 

start of our shopping, the question is not 
what is the absolute best, most effective 
way to spend our money. The question is, 
given the information we have and our cir-
cumstances of the holiday season, are we 
doing the best we can?

To give 
 or 
 not to 
 give?

A reluctant 
‘Go Blue!’

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 — 13 

B

ack in March, when COVID-19 
hit and it became clear that 
schools would have to shut 

down, I remember thinking: well, at 
least I go to the University of Michigan.

I was lucky, I thought, to go to such 

a cutting-edge school. Our president 
is a physician. We have a faculty of in-
credibly 
knowledgeable 
researchers 

and professors. We have one of the best 
medical schools in the nation, as well as 
a stellar public health program. More 
than that, even: Thias university is run 
by good people. They’ll figure this out. 
Whatever the best policies are, Michi-
gan will find them and put them in place 
as needed. They might stumble, as any-
one does when facing a novel threat, but 
certainly they won’t lag behind other 
universities or organizations. At the 
very least, I thought, I can trust them to 
act in a morally upstanding way.

How wrong I was. 
In June, tuition hikes and a “COV-

ID fee” were approved for the 2020-21 
school year, despite the economic crisis 
gripping America and the University’s 
growing endowment. Then, in August, 
the University reopened campus for fall 
semester, despite a recommendation 
from their own COVID-19 safety team 
that the University stay shut down. In-
stead of offering testing surveillance 
systems like other major universities, 
University President Mark Schlissel 
made controversial comments claim-
ing that testing can create a false sense 
of security, as, he argued, it did during 
the HIV epidemic. He was lambasted 
for the comments and quickly retracted 
them, but he and other administrators 
failed to significantly change the Uni-
versity’s testing policies. They insisted 
they simply did not have the capacity to 
test more students, while working with 
sports teams to ensure student-athletes 
received daily testing through the Big 
Ten Conference. 

In September, the University’s Grad-

uate Student Instructors went on strike 
to protest the lack of COVID-19 protec-
tions. They were quickly followed by 
the RAs, who criticized the University’s 
safety policies in dorms. Both strikes 
were treated with complete disrespect 
by the University administration, who 

filed an injunction against the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization and threat-
ened to fire striking RAs. Dining hall 
workers had to cancel their own strike 
when they were told the University 
would retaliate against strikers.

Only in the last few weeks, following 

a Washtenaw County stay-in-place or-
der targeting University students, has 
the University finally walked back some 
of its policies. So far, the University has 
limited the number of students who 
can return to dorms next semester and 
asked all students to stay home come 
January if they are able. But the Uni-
versity is still holding in-person classes 
next semester, and administrators like 
Schlissel have refused to apologize for 
their missteps, with Schlissel saying in 
a recent The Michigan Daily interview 
that he doesn’t regret how he chose to 
handle of the virus.

Things are, to put it lightly, a total 

mess. I’ve watched it unfold from the 
safety of my parents’ homes with a small 
measure of awe and a large measure of 
fury. I don’t mean to be dramatic, but 
I truly am disgusted by how the Uni-
versity has handled this crisis. At ev-
ery turn, they have placed profits over 
safety, and chosen to place the whims of 
young adult students above the advice 
of educated experts. In doing so, they’re 
not only putting the health and safety of 
their students, staff and faculty at risk 
— they’re also endangering the greater 
Ann Arbor population, a community 
which has always supported the Univer-
sity. This type of selfishness is frighten-
ingly similar to the attitudes we see at a 
national level, with the Trump adminis-
tration’s abysmal response to COVID-19, 
and it makes me ashamed to say I go to 
the University of Michigan. 

I know I’m not the only student who 

feels this way about the current admin-
istration, but I think students who are 
seniors, such as myself, are put in a 
uniquely frustrating position because of 
it. This is my last semester at the Uni-
versity. Next semester, I’m taking part-
time classes from home, and then I’m 
graduating. My college career is rapidly 
wrapping up, and I’m stuck in the frus-
trating position of wondering: Is this it? 
Is this how I’m going to remember col-

lege? 

As a graduating senior, I get asked 

often about my time at the University. 
Recruiters, relatives and friends want 
to hear about my college experience — 
often, I suspect, expecting that I’ll wax 
poetic about how amazing the Univer-
sity is as a school. That seems to be the 
expectation from alumni, and part of the 
reason the University has such a stellar 
reputation. Objectively, I know there’s a 
lot I could talk about: I had a very good 
experience during my first three years 
at the University doing all the stereo-
typical college things — going to football 
games, getting surreptitiously drunk in 
dorm rooms, even studying in the Sha-
piro Undergraduate Library. But in the 
moment, my frustration with the admin-
istration overshadows everything else. I 
don’t want to talk about how fun it was 
to go to football games two years ago. I 
want to talk about what the administra-
tion is doing now, and why it makes me 
so pissed off.

An obvious response to this is that 

perhaps I shouldn’t let the actions of a 
select few administrators taint my view 
of something as broad as my experience 
in college. To say I’m ashamed of my 
college administration doesn’t neces-
sarily mean I need to be ashamed of my 
college: The student body is, after all, 
not the administration. I didn’t choose 
the administration’s actions, so they’re 
not my responsibility.

But I think it’s an oversimplifica-

tion to say we can so easily draw a line 
between the student body and college 
administration. In conversation, we 
constantly identify ourselves with the 
faculty and administration of our col-
lege. When our school is ranked one of 
the top public universities in the Unit-
ed States, we tend to feel proud of that, 
even though we had no part in creating 
that ranking; when we win at football, 
we gloat to all our friends that Wolver-
ines are simply a superior bunch, and 
when we lose, we feel embarrassed and 
make excuses for why our team is still 
the best, really, but just having an off 
week. We use phrases like “we won” be-
cause it feels like a collective achieve-
ment: It is a thing we are told to feel a 
part of. The University of Michigan, like 

many other colleges, champions a nar-
rative of community among its students 
— that we are the Leaders and Best to-
gether. We are all a part of the Universi-
ty, the story goes, and so we do identify 
ourselves with the actions of the insti-
tution, whether we actively participated 
in them or not.

It reminds me of 2017: Shortly after 

I graduated from high school, I went 
backpacking in Europe. I met a lot of 
people on my trip, people from all over 
the world, and they all asked me the 
same question: “So, you’re American? 
Do you like Donald Trump?”

I was always quick to assure them 

that, no, I didn’t support Trump; and in 
fact, there were many Americans who 
didn’t. “I promise,” I said, “We’re not 
all nuts.” That I had to say that — and 
that they had to ask the question — em-
barrassed me. Electing Trump felt like 
the most irresponsible collective ac-
tion our country could have taken. I was 
ashamed to be an American then in the 
same way I’m ashamed to be a Wolver-
ine now.

Maybe we shouldn’t define ourselves 

by the institutions that lead us, but to 
me, that feels like the path to compla-
cency. If the institutions that lead us 
don’t represent us, we have no obliga-
tion to make sure they do good. In that 
sense, maybe feeling ashamed when an 
institution messes up is a good thing be-
cause it keeps us accountable. It might 
be why Trump is on his way out of of-
fice. Maybe, in a few months, it’ll be 
why U-M administrators finally apolo-
gize for the mistakes they’ve made. Af-
ter all, student outrage is what cata-
lyzed the few changes that have arisen 
so far, including the concessions made 
to GEO and RAs — student and alumni 
outrage might be all that can continue 
to cause change moving forward. For my 
part, I know I won’t forget the missteps 
of this administration quickly. Though 
I may not be in Ann Arbor moving for-
ward, you can bet I’ll be watching the 
University from a distance, ready to 
step in with a pointed email or passive-
aggressive Twitter reply when the situa-
tion calls for it. Accountability may look 
different for alumni than it does for stu-
dents, but it does still exist.

T

he code word was perfect: obscure 
enough so that the boys couldn’t 
decipher it, but not so strange that 

it would attract the attention of our teach-
ers. In the lunch line, we were giggling by the 
shelves of Cheetos and Funyuns, pointing at 
the girl a few steps ahead:

“Look, look,” I said, motioning to the back 

of her white t-shirt. “Her walrus is showing.”

Walrus. For a group of fourth graders, that 

was the most creative code word we could 
come up with for “bra.” We were at the point in 
elementary school when some students dou-
bled in height overnight, when a small fraction 
of the boys grew little hairs above their lips 
and when a few of the girls started using pads. 
It was the early stages of puberty, so we were 
immature — which perhaps made the environ-
ment all the more conducive for words like 
“walrus.” 

Looking back, I think our teasing came 

from fear; we couldn’t even bring ourselves 
to say the word of something so unknown, so 
intimidating. As a small, flat-chested tomboy, 
I dreaded any change that indicated woman-
hood, despite the long, sometimes awkward 
conversations I had with my mom about pu-
berty. I feared the inevitable truth that as I ap-
proached middle school, my body would start 
changing, morphing into an unfamiliar shape 
with foreign characteristics, whether it be hair 
or boobs or extra fat somewhere. 

When my mom suggested I get my first 

“bra” — and I put it in quotes because, as many 
women reading this would know, it was liter-
ally a piece of unsupportive fabric — I agreed 
only because it had started to feel uncomfort-
able playing soccer without one. But in the line 
at Dunham’s Sports, I hid behind my mom, 
embarrassed, while the cashier laughed affec-
tionately and scanned the tag on a small blue 
training bra.

I detested puberty because I didn’t want to 

grow up, but at the time I didn’t know what 
growing up really meant, in terms of my body. 
Even in eighth grade, when I spent an hour in 
the principal’s office after breaking dress code, 
waiting for my mom to bring me longer shorts, 
or during freshman year of high school, when 
a male friend groped my butt at the homecom-
ing dance, I didn’t make the realization that to 
be a woman means to have two bodies at once.

The first body is the mechanistic kind. It is 

the one we have known since childhood and 
its job is to function. It breathes, it cries, some-
times it’s injured or tired. It kicks soccer balls, 
chases siblings, eats burritos and takes naps. I 
am grateful not to have to think about mine all 
that much — it is mostly just a vessel to carry 
me throughout my day. At the age of 21, I’m 
this body, and only this body, in rare moments: 
when I’m alone or with my family. It is only 
then that my body’s existence is not under the 
survey of outward eyes.

The second body is the one that comes with 

puberty; it is the body of sex. This is the body 
that ends up existing for other people — for 
their observation, for their pleasure — whether 
we want it to or not. This body is a tool that we 
can enhance with the right pair of jeans or a 
snug-fitting shirt; we can use it to wield power 
over straight men. At the age of 21, I know that 
I can rarely turn off this body. It doesn’t mat-
ter if I’m playing tennis, buying groceries or 
out with friends — my moving through space is 
wedded to the male gaze.

Coming to understand my second body 

was much more subtle than the experience 
of puberty. At some point, I went from resist-
ing growing up to feeling like I had to rush to 
get there. Much of high school was a confused 
effort to attract attention through my body, 

which was slow to develop. But why? Whether 
it was from what I saw on TV, from what older 
girls told me or even a slight biological inclina-
tion, somehow I automatically began using my 
body to wield sexual attention from men, even 
though it was unclear what I wanted from that 
attention.

I remember buying a push-up bra but not 

really understanding why that was important 
or what I wanted it to lead to. Why did I want 
the boys in my Spanish class to see more of my 
boobs? Maybe I just wanted to be cool, and I 
thought their approval would validate me. But 
why did I think the only way to get noticed was 
through my body? And why was my metric for 
self-esteem based on my physical appearance, 
specifically that of my sexuality? 

Of course, high school is a time when many 

young people begin exploring their sexuality, 
and along the way, we are bound to try things 
that might seem stupid or embarrassing later 
on. In reality, my wearing a push-up bra to 
Spanish class was definitely not as deep as it 
seems now. But the fact that as a high schooler 
who wasn’t experienced, fully interested or 
ready to have sex, I still had the subconscious 
motivation to display my body for attention is 
slightly disturbing to me now. It shows how 
pervasive the idea is that a woman’s worth is 
determined by her sexual appeal and how the 
process of using — and maybe misusing — the 
second body starts off at a young age.

What has changed for me, now a college se-

nior, is more so my mindset than my actions. If 
I choose to use my second body, I do so know-
ing I am confident in myself and my sexuality 
and I can understand the motivations behind 
what I do, wear or say. My second body is no 
longer just for others to enjoy, or under their 
control — it is under mine.

I can also now understand that sometimes 

we want to use our second bodies to attract at-
tention. Maybe it’s for the same reasons as be-
fore — for validation, self-worth — but maybe 
it’s also to reclaim power. When men reduce 
us to one dimension and for a few purposes — 
bodies for sex, childbirth, motherhood — per-
haps we want to expose how that male gaze 
and its superiority are so sensitive and eas-
ily manipulated. Maybe we want to show how 
fickle the idea is that men are always in control, 
that their gaze intimidates and traps us. Maybe 
we want to say: No, it is you that is simple. 

And yet, as I write these words and think 

these thoughts, I falter, I worry. I fear I am try-
ing to justify behavior that still results in objec-
tification and degradement. But then, I won-
der if I am placing blame where there should 
be none. I have no ill judgements toward 
women who wield the power of their second 
body when they want to, nor do I feel any self-
directed shame when I think back to the times 
I’ve done the same. But it’s difficult not to ques-
tion if, for straight women, this choreographed 
dance between our second bodies and men is 
truly something we want or if it’s something 
we’ve been trained to want. In the balance of 
something as delicate as power, which can 
quickly inverse or disappear, it is hard to know 
what actions are truly autonomous and which 
are conditional to a long-standing patriarchy.

As I did when I was a fourth grader con-

fused about why my friend had to wear a “wal-
rus,” I went to my mom for advice and answers 
on the second body. Our conversation was long 
as always, but this time, it was not awkward. 
I watched as she sat on the couch, decades of 
her own memories as a woman flashing in her 
mind. She offered a piece of advice, one that 
provided maybe the only way to find solace 
in the complicated reality of being a woman: 
“Just do whatever the hell you want.”

Championship. 
It 
includes 

three 
Wolverine 
freshman 

forwards — Matty Beniers, 
Thomas 
Bordeleau, 
and 

Brendan Brisson — as well as 
sophomore forward Johnny 
Beecher 
and 
sophomore 

defenseman Cam York. All 
five will be unavailable for 
Michigan’s Dec. 8 and 9 home 
series 
against 
Minnesota, 

which will be missing three of 
its own players. 

The tournament will take 

place from Dec. 25 through Jan. 
5 in Edmonton. Though teams 
were initially told that players 
would not have to report until 
Dec. 13 — a factor that played 
into 
the 
Wolverines’ 
and 

Gophers’ decision to compete 
on the preceding Tuesday 
and Wednesday, according to 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
— 
USA 
Hockey 
recently 

mandated that players enter 
its bubble in Plymouth on Dec. 
6 to comply with IIHF rules. 
The decision coincided with a 
pair of positive tests at Team 
Canada’s selection camp in 
Red Deer, Alberta. 

Without its key players, who 

have combined for 21 points 
in six games this season, 
Michigan 
will 
need 
more 

production 
from 
elsewhere 

on the team. Much of that 
production should come from 
players already in the lineup — 
players like freshman forward 
Kent Johnson, who leads the 
team with eight points. 

Johnson 
might 
have 
to 

step up even more, but there’s 

plenty of room for others in 
the lineup to make their mark 
as well. Sophomore forward 
Eric 
Ciccolini 
has 
shown 

flashes in four appearances, 
scoring two goals and earning 
a plus-minus of +3. The series 
against the Gophers will be an 
opportunity for him to prove 
he deserves more time on the 
ice. 

“There’s 
some 
guys 
in 

the lineup that you’re just 

expecting to do more,” Pearson 
said. “Eric Ciccolini has been 
in and out. He’s proven he’s 
ready to have a really good 
sophomore season. We expect 
more out of him on a daily 
basis.”

But 
with 
five 
players 

missing, the Wolverines will 
need to dig deeper into the 
roster and rely on players who 
haven’t yet seen much of the 
ice. In Michigan’s loss to Notre 
Dame on Saturday, sophomore 
defenseman 
Jay 
Keranen 

appeared in his second game 
this season after not playing 
his freshman year. There’s a 
good chance he’ll fill in for 
York in the Minnesota series. 

Things 
will 
be 
even 

thinner at forward, where 
the Wolverines will lose four 
players to World Juniors. And 

with just 16 forwards on the 
roster, Michigan will have to 
rely on every player at that 
position. As of now, only two 
— freshmen Josh Groll and 
Philippe Lapointe — have yet 
to see ice time this year. Groll 
tallied 42 points in 41 games 
with the USHL Lincoln Stars 
last season, while Lapointe 
notched 55 points in 36 games 
with the BCHL Trail Smoke 
Eaters. 

“(Groll) has looked really 

good in practice,” Pearson 
said. “He had a bit of a setback 
(a couple of weeks ago), that’s 
why he hasn’t played at this 
point … but he’s ready. Phil 
Lapointe’s 
an 
outstanding 

player. He’s gonna be a really 
good player for us here. We’ll 
look for him to come in the 
lineup.”

In any situation, depth is a 

necessity for a hockey team 
to be successful. It’s normal 
to lose a few players to injury 
throughout the season. Teams 
can plan around that. 

Less predictable is losing 

five players at the same time. 
The Wolverines have a deep 
roster; such a deep hit in a 
series against the No. 5 team in 
the country will put that depth 
to the test.

Turnovers plague Michigan in narrow 

win over Oakland

With just over seven minutes 

remaining in the first half, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
held an eight-point lead over 
winless Oakland. Just two-
and-a-half minutes later, the 
Wolverines’ advantage had been 
cut to just two points, leading 
to arguments on Michigan’s 
sideline and enthusiastic cheers 
from 
the 
Golden 
Grizzlies’ 

bench. 

During that span, senior 

guard Chaundee Brown missed 
a 3-pointer — one of nine missed 
threes from the Wake Forest 
transfer on the day — and the 
Wolverines committed three 
turnovers 
on 
consecutive 

possessions. 

What had been billed as 

an easy, early-season win for 
Michigan was quickly turning 
into anything but. Oakland led 
by two going into halftime, in 
large part due to the Wolverines’ 
15 first-half turnovers — five 
more than they had in the entire 
Bowling Green game. 

“Oakland 
(was) 
active 

defensively, being active with 
their hands, playing in passing 
lanes and getting deflections,” 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
said afterwards. “I’m not gonna 
just sit here and say, ‘Hey, we 
didn’t do well because of’ — We 
made mistakes on our own.

“There were plays where 

we were catching it in the 
two blocks or in the paint and 
putting it down on the floor. 
That’s something you can’t do 
when we’re playing against a 
smaller group with active hands. 
What they did was they got 
deflections or got steals.” 

The Golden Grizzlies’ tallest 

starter 
was 
6-foot-7 
Daniel 

Oladapo. To compensate for 
its lack of size, Oakland came 
out in a 1-3-1 matchup zone, 
which 
stumped 
Michigan’s 

ball-handlers early on. The 
Wolverines tried to penetrate 
the defense — with either passes 
to the high post or on drives off 
the dribble — but the Golden 
Grizzlies flocked to the ball, 
stripping it or picking off cross-
court looks. 

“We watched film on their 

zone and from watching film we 
didn’t see it as that aggressive,” 
senior 
wing 
Isaiah 
Livers 

said. 
“… 
Everybody 
makes 

adjustments and they came out 
and made adjustments to their 
zone. We weren’t ready at first 
and even for part of the second 
half.” 

Michigan 
fared 
slightly 

better holding onto the ball in 
the second half, only turning 
it over five times. Instead, it 
was the Wolverines’ inability 
to make shots on the perimeter 
that kept the Golden Grizzlies 
in 
the 
game. 
Either 
way, 

Oakland’s 
unconventional 

scheme was making Michigan 
uncomfortable offensively. 

Without 
Zavier 
Simpson 

leading 
the 
offense, 
point 

guard responsibilities fall on 
graduate student Mike Smith 
and senior guard Eli Brooks. 
After combining for just two 
turnovers in the season opener, 

the duo accounted for eight on 
Sunday night. Whether their 
performances were indicative 
of Smith and Brooks settling 
into a new offense and a new 
role respectively or it was an 
aberration, the Wolverines need 
a steady hand at that position.

Thanks to a dominant display 

in overtime, Michigan overcame 
its 
turnover 
problems 
and 

narrowly avoided a catastrophic 
loss. Early in the season though, 
a win is a win.

“1,000 
percent 
just 
the 

zone, outlier,” Livers said. “We 
actually, all preseason, we take 
care of the ball. We get after 
each other in practice. Our scout 
team does a great job of getting 
into us as well. When we’re 
scrimmaging, we don’t allow 
easy catches, we make it tough 
for the guy handling the ball as 
well so I think it was just a good 
learning curve.

“Everybody was watching 

that game and say ‘Oh, they 
can’t play great against a 1-3-1 
matchup zone or anything like 
that.’ I’m glad it happened now. 
Chaundee made a comment, 
‘Rather now than the Final Four 
or Sweet 16,’ so that’s what I’m 
happy about and we can learn 
from it.”

With five players leaving for World Juniors, 

Wolverines need depth players to step up

Michigan coach Mel Pearson allowed five of his top players to join the US 
World Juniors team.

‘Disability is not inability’: Michigan’s Adaptive Sports and

Fitness Program strives to assert itself

Cathryn 
Gray 
isn’t 
used 

to being around people like 
her. She’s a 4.0 student, an 
internationally 
decorated 

athlete, the first female member 
of Michigan’s Adaptive Sports 
and Fitness Program — and she 
has Cerebral Palsy.

Cerebral Palsy is a mobility 

disorder caused by abnormal 
brain development or damage to 
the developing brain. Often, it 
imparts a very distinct gait.

So when Gray saw Maddy 

Gustafson walking through her 
residence hall on move-in day, 
she immediately knew that she 
had found someone like her. 

“I knew right away that she 

probably 
had 
CP 
(Cerebral 

Palsy) too,” Gray said. 

Trying not to be too intrusive, 

Gray 
introduced 
herself 
to 

Gustafson and confirmed their 
similarities. 
In 
the 
course 

of 
their 
conversation, 
Gray 

revealed to Gustafson that she 
was at Michigan on an Adaptive 
Track and Field scholarship. 

Gustafson had no idea these 

sorts of opportunities existed 
at Michigan. The absence of 
attention 
to 
disability 
paid 

by her hometown community 
had meant that for Gustafson, 
the expectation that she could 
participate 
in 
sports 
had 

evaporated. Despite her love 
of running, Gustafson had last 
been able to be as active as 
she’d hoped to be during her 
middle school years. Eagerly, 
Gustafson 
accepted 
Gray’s 

invitation to accompany her to 
the next adaptive Track and 
Field practice.

Fast forward four months, 

Gustafson and Gray are best 
friends and teammates, looking 
forward to competing alongside 
one another for the first time 
once it’s safe. 

“I 
know 
from 
my 
own 

experience how isolating CP can 

be,” Gray said. “Being a woman 
with a disability, it can be really 
hard to find other people like 
you. I don’t think anyone would 
turn down the opportunity 
to be a part of a community. It 
changed my life, so I’m going to 
take any opportunity I can to 
help the program grow.”

 Sadly, Gustafson’s example 

is 
a 
common 
one. 
Most 

communities are woefully far 
from 
recognizing 
adaptive 

sports as a necessary facet of 
the sporting experience. In 
place of making the necessary 
accommodations 
so 
that 

individuals with disability can 
participate in sports alongside 
those with able bodies, many 
schools instead elect to offer 
individuals 
with 
disability 

special 
positions 
like 
team 

manager, or token gestures like 
two minutes of playing time 
during the last game of the 
season.

This 
lackluster 
effort 
at 

inclusivity 
is 
exactly 
what 

the University of Michigan’s 
Adaptive Sports and Fitness 

program 
aims 
to 
address. 

During a time in which public 
health 
measures 
necessarily 

disincentivize 
neighborliness, 

Gray’s efforts to befriend and 
include Gustafson embody the 
vision of the program according 
to its founder and director, 
Dr. Oluwaferanmi Okanlami, 
affectionately known around 
campus as “Dr. O.”

“We have to create equal 

access to physical and emotional 
health 
and 
wellness 
for 

students 
with 
disabilities,” 

Okanlami said. “As a physician, 
recognizing the importance of 
physical fitness for everyone, let 
alone those with disabilities, is 
something that we’re trying to 
close the disparity gap on and 
make sure that marginalized, 
underrepresented 
minority 

groups like individuals with 
disabilities 
have 
access 
to 

physical fitness and therefore a 
more healthy life.”

When 
individuals 
with 

physical 
disabilities 
aren’t 

physically active, their muscles 
often begin to atrophy, or 

degenerate. 
As 
a 
result, 
it 

becomes increasingly difficult 
to move around. Thus, as both 
Okanlami and Gray underscore, 
ready access to adaptive sports 
for individuals with disabilities 
is crucial. 

Importantly, 
however, 

Okanlami stresses that this 
access should take shape in the 
form of a program which both 
individuals with and without 
disabilities can participate in.

“This 
is 
diversity, 
equity 

and inclusion,” Okanlami said. 
“If we have a way that we can 
create the parameters to allow 
everyone to participate while 
not limiting the opportunities 
for 
the 
individuals 
with 

disabilities, we’re going to do 
that.” 

Establishing and growing this 

program hasn’t come without 
obstacles, Okanlami explained.

“Major hurdle number one 

is awareness,” Okanlami said. 
“We’re trying to get people 
to recognize that disability is 
not inability – that disability 
does not make them any less 

of an athlete and that it does 
not lessen their desire, drive, 
or need for physical activity in 
sport.”

Gray 
echoed 
Okanlami’s 

sentiment. “I don’t see a lot of 
people with disabilities in the 
media, so sometimes having a 
disability like CP can be a little 
bit lonely.”

For Okanlami, the Michigan 

community has a long way to 
go in order to catch up to other 
established programs around 
the nation.

“If we want to be the leaders 

and the best in this arena, we 
could be,” Okanlami said. “But 
we have to acknowledge that 
right now, not only are we not 
the best, we are not leading, 
and we are not even in the 
conversation.”

Okanlami 
laid 
out 
how 

schools like Alabama, which has 
a $10 million facility dedicated 
exclusively 
to 
adaptive 

athletics, and Illinois, a widely-
recognized 
powerhouse 
in 

wheelchair racing, are “blowing 
Michigan out of the water.”

He stressed that in addition 

to expanding programs like this 
one, introducing adaptive sports 
to younger people is even more 
important. As such, one of the 
program’s main objectives is to 
integrate adaptive sports into 
the state of Michigan’s K-12 
curriculum. 

“We’re 
trying 
to 
change 

that 
misperception, 
that 

stigma,” Okanlami said, “and 
we’re 
starting 
that 
around 

the elementary school level so 
that kids don’t see disability as 
a negative, they just see it as 
another aspect of the things that 
make us different.”

Okanlami 
spoke 
of 
this 

process 
of 
“mainstreaming” 

adaptive sports as a sort of 
Gestalt switch. Wheelchairs, 
traditionally 
seen 
as 

impediments 
to 
sports 
like 

basketball or tennis, should 
instead be seen as necessary 
equipment 
for 
playing 

wheelchair 
basketball 
or 

wheelchair tennis, just as ice-
skates are seen as necessary for 
playing ice hockey.

“This doesn’t mean you have 

to use a chair in your real life, but 
when you’re playing (wheelchair 
basketball), that’s how you play 
this sport,” Okanlami said.

Currently, 
the 
Adaptive 

Sports and Fitness program 
houses 
wheelchair 
tennis, 

wheelchair basketball, and track 
and field, and is incorporating 
para-equestrian activities. In 
the future, Okanlami would like 
to see the program expand into 
other sports, such as golf and 
wheelchair racing. 

Gray, among others, seeks 

to expand the influence of the 
program in other ways. 

“What I really want to do is 

to use competing as a vehicle for 
positive change,” Gray said. “I 
want to grow the program and 
speak about disability issues 
like my mom did for me growing 
up. I want to do that for other 
people.”

Erratic 

quarterback 
play hurts 
Wolverines

Run defense 
collapses in 
Penn State

loss

Don Brown looked down, then 

back up. His lips pursed as his 
mask sat below his chin. Penn State 
quarterback Will Levis was in the 
end zone celebrating. Brown was 
left to watch and wonder. About 
what was next after the final 
Nittany Lions touchdown to seal 
a 27-17 Michigan loss. About how 
to fix a defense that again showed 
porous holes. And surely, about his 
job security.

The Levis touchdown run made 

up two of the 254 Penn State 
rushing yards on the day — all 
without Journey Brown or Noah 
Cain, its two top running backs 
coming into the season. Keyvone 
Lee 
finished 
with 
134 
yards, 

quarterback Sean Clifford with 73 
— including a 28-yard touchdown 
on a quarterback draw. To add to 
the humiliation, it’s the Nittany 
Lions’ first win of the year. To 
further add to the humiliation, it’s 
not even the worst performance of 
the year for the Wolverines’ run 
defense.

That 
honor 
still 
goes 
to 

Wisconsin’s 341 yards on the 
ground two weeks ago. Much of 
Penn State’s came because of the 
same problems — setting an edge 
and missing tackles.

After the loss to the Badgers, 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
talked of evaluating all facets of the 
program and changing what needed 
to be changed. He said Saturday 
they put in two new schemes to 
help set the edge better. 

“A lot of the plays today weren’t 

initial edge plays,” Harbaugh said. 
“They started inside and the back 
was able to find the crease on the 
edge. And we either folded in or we 
didn’t make the tackle on the edge 
or a combination of things.”

From the first drive of the game 

— a 75-yard march down the field 
that featured 39 rushing yards — to 
the last, on which a Lee cut to the 
outside got him 23 yards and sealed 
the game, Penn State seemed to get 
whatever it wanted on the ground.

Either Michigan couldn’t get to 

the ball carrier or Michigan couldn’t 
tackle the ball carrier. It was the 
latest in a line of disappointing 
defensive performances, and will 
add fuel to the fire for those calling 
for Brown’s head.

Amid a flurry of cliche and 

saying he needed to watch the 
film, junior defensive end Taylor 
Upshaw offered this when asked if 
there were any adjustments made 
during the game.

“We just gotta be there,” he said. 

“So I don’t know how to answer 
that. I think that’s a coach Brown 
answer.”

The tackling, at least, should be 

simple, Upshaw said. It’s something 
they’ve been doing their whole 
lives as football players. “It’s just 
something you’ve gotta do,” he said.

But they didn’t. And Harbaugh, 

a coach renowned for his attention 
to detail and intensity, who kept his 
team on the field for practice when 
the Big Ten cancelled football and 
Michigan released a statement 
halting all athletic activities in 
March, was left lamenting a lack of 
fundamentals.

“I feel like sometimes we’re 

tackling a little too high and 
leaving our feet a little too early,” 
he said. “Timing of the tackle, 
wrapping and getting our man on 
the ground.”

To open his press conference 

following 
Michigan’s 
drop 
to 

2-4, Harbaugh was asked if his 
approach had changed since 2016, 
when the program seemed on the 
cusp of being a national contender. 
The hiring of Brown — a process 
that started when D.J. Durkin left 
to become head coach at Maryland, 
Harbaugh looked up who ran the 
No. 1 defense in the country the 
prior year, saw Brown’s name and 
got moving — is a quintessential 
example.

But on Saturday, a Penn State 

offense in the throes of its worst 
season in nearly two decades ran 
the ball down the throat of Brown’s 
defense for 60 minutes, and the 
distance from 2016 and national 
relevance and yearly appearances 
among the top five defenses looked 
further than Brown’s stare.

ALEC COHEN/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh described his team’s mood as disappointing after Saturday’s 27-17 loss to formerly winless Penn State.

When halftime ended Saturday 

afternoon and Michigan’s players 
gathered around their position 
coaches, Jim Harbaugh stood by 
Cade McNamara. The sophomore 
quarterback 
had 
missed 
two 

second-quarter 
drives 
with 
a 

shoulder injury, but he was still 
the Wolverines’ path to reversing 
their 17-7 deficit and Harbaugh 
knew it.

McNamara, 
though, 

represented more than that. He 
was Harbaugh’s only chance to 
lend a semblance of positivity to 
a season that careens toward new 
lows with each passing week.

Then his shoulder tightened 

back up, Harbaugh re-inserted Joe 
Milton and the Wolverines scored 
just 10 second-half points. With a 
27-17 loss to a previously winless 
Penn State team, Michigan fell to 
2-4.

And in the end, this week’s 

iteration 
of 
Harbaugh’s 

calamitous Year Six looked just 
like the others. When the Nittany 
Lions sealed their win with a 
final third-down conversion, the 
only sound on Michigan’s sideline 
was a player slamming his plastic 
water bottle against a metal 
bench.

“No one wants to lose a game,” 

junior defensive lineman Taylor 
Upshaw said. “So it’s frustrating, 
of course.”

This year, losing has happened 

at the highest rate since 2008, 
when 
Michigan 
finished 
3-9. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
four 
losses 

are already the second-highest 
total of the Harbaugh era. In his 
previous five years in Ann Arbor, 

Harbaugh hadn’t hit that mark 
before Week 12.

It made sense, then, when 

Harbaugh’s frustration reached a 
boiling point Saturday. This was 
the Wolverines’ opportunity to 
build off momentum from a come-
from-behind, triple-overtime win 
over Rutgers last weekend. That it 
came against a winless opponent 
should have provided Harbaugh 
with the perfect opportunity to 
reverse this season’s course.

Instead, 
Michigan 
only 

sunk further into the depths 
of despair. The loudest cheers 
from 
Harbaugh’s 
sideline 
in 

the second half came on Penn 
State penalties. When freshman 
receiver A.J. Henning leapt over 
a Nittany Lions’ defender to make 
a highlight-reel catch, Harbaugh 
had to turn towards a group of 
players sitting on the bench and 
tell them to stand up and cheer.

“It’s tough to be in this position, 

it’s not what we imagined,” senior 
right tackle Andrew Stueber said. 
“As an older guy on the team, you 
really gotta keep everybody up.”

For 
stretches 
in 
Saturday’s 

second half, the Wolverines did 
that. When junior running back 
Hassan Haskins cut the deficit to 
20-17, he was met with fist bumps 
and butt slaps. A similar reaction 
met Upshaw after his third-
quarter sack.

Far more common, though, 

was the familiar intersection of 
frustration and dejection.

Harbaugh’s 
calm 
demeanor 

evaporated for good when the 
Nittany Lions converted a second-
and-6 and third-and-7 deep in 
Michigan territory to restore their 
10-point lead, waving his arms 
and yelling angrily after each.

“We 
gotta 
tackle 
better,” 

Harbaugh said. “There’s too many 
missed tackles.”

A drive later, his frustration 

culminated when Haskins and 
Milton were stuffed short of first 
downs on consecutive plays, just 
outside field goal range.

“You’re down there on the 

field, you don’t really know for 
sure (about the spots),” Harbaugh 
said. “But getting the tackles on 
the short yardage and just being 
able to get a yard when you need 
it offensively. … Our inability to 
do that and their ability to do that 
was critical in the game.”

After Milton’s stop, Harbaugh 

lowered his mask, screaming at 
the field judge to bring out the 
chains and double-check his spot. 
The official complied, proving 
that, once again, Michigan had 
come up short.

The same rang true again 

moments later on the defensive 
side. This time, Harbaugh had no 
fire left in him. All he could do 
was yell out one word and look 
up at the south scoreboard for a 
replay. What he said was obscured 
by his mask and fake crowd noise, 
but it takes no great leap of faith 
to assume it may have been four 
letters.

“I’m very competitive and want 

to win,” Harbaugh said. “And hate 
losing.”

This 
year, 
that’s 
happened 

far too often for his liking. On 
Saturday, it happened against a 
winless team, seven days after 
a win that seemed to reverse 
momentum.

So 
after 
the 
game, 
when 

Harbaugh was asked to sum up his 
team’s mood, he could only offer 
up one word.

“Disappointing.”
Yet again.

Frustrations mount for Harbaugh’s team 
in loss to previously winless Penn State

When Cade McNamara led a 

17-point comeback against Rutgers 
last week, it appeared the Michigan 
football team had found its answer at 
quarterback.

After an underwhelming two-

week stretch for junior quarterback 
Joe 
Milton, 
McNamara 
did 

everything 
necessary 
to 
secure 

the Wolverines’ starting job, and 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh gave 
it to him against a winless Penn State 
team on Saturday. But in a 27-17 loss 
to the Nittany Lions, the Wolverines 
were doomed by erratic play from 
both Milton and McNamara.

Throughout the game, Michigan’s 

quarterbacks failed to capitalize 
on the team’s performance on the 
ground. The Wolverines racked up 
108 rushing yards in the first half 
alone, which should’ve set their 
passing game up for success.

“It makes the (offensive) line 

not play harder, but play with more 
confidence maybe,” senior offensive 
lineman Andrew Stueber said. “… 
The defense starts getting more 
worried about the run game so they 
start bringing down some safeties, so 
it kind of just opened up the offense 
as a whole.”

But 
the 
opposite 
was 
true. 

Michigan was reluctant to throw 
the ball downfield for much of 
the afternoon, leaving much to be 
desired. A good portion of that can 
be attributed to the shot McNamara 
took on the team’s second possession, 
which sent him to the locker room 
with a shoulder injury and forced 
Milton onto the field.

The same accuracy struggles that 

sent Milton to the bench against 
the Scarlet Knights and Wisconsin 
continued on Saturday. After a 
21-yard completion on his first 
attempt, Milton’s next two throws 
were way off the mark. One sailed 
over a receiver’s head, while the 
other bounced a few yards in front of 
his target.

Harbaugh 
turned 
back 
to 

McNamara 
after 
two 
Milton-

led series resulted in zero points. 
McNamara completed his first four 
passes on the Wolverines’ opening 
drive prior to the injury, but when 
he returned from the locker room, 
the effects of his shoulder pain were 
clear.

He completed only one pass longer 

than 15 yards in the second half. 
Without the gunslinger mentality 
that powered Michigan past Rutgers, 
he struggled to put together scoring 
drives. He finished 12-of-25 passing 
with just 91 yards and no touchdowns 
— a far cry from his performance last 
week, when he completed 27-of-36 
passes for 260 yards and accounted 
for five total touchdowns.

As 
the 
game 
progressed, 

McNamara’s 
shoulder 
worsened. 

When the Wolverines needed a 
score to make it a one-possession 
game 
with 
eight 
minutes 
left, 

McNamara opened the drive with 
five 
consecutive 
incompletions. 

Sandwiched between them was 
a strip sack, though a penalty 
prevented 
the 
turnover 
from 

standing.

By the midway point of the fourth 

quarter, Harbaugh had seen enough. 
He opted to roll with Milton in the 
game’s final minutes.

“Cade, really gutty performance to 

come back, but the shoulder did start 
to tighten up,” Harbaugh said. “I 
could see it. He was doing everything 
he could to stay in the game, but I just 
felt like that was tightening up and 
causing (pain). I felt like going to Joe 
was the best option for us. I can tell 
you this: Cade was doing everything 
he possibly could to rally the team 
and to play on when (his shoulder) 
was tightening up on him. That was 
the reason.”

But by then, it didn’t matter who 

was under center. The Wolverines 
had 
already 
proved 
themselves 

incapable of taking advantage of 
run-game success to stretch the 
field vertically. Playcalling became 
predictable, and a comeback wasn’t 
in the cards for an offense juggling 
an injured quarterback and an 
inaccurate one.

A week after it seemed Michigan 

had solved its quarterback woes, 
Saturday left the team with more 
questions than answers at the 
position.

Michigan football coaches need to wear their masks correctly

As of Monday, there have 

been 
well 
over 
13 
million 

COVID-19 cases and more than 

265,000 deaths in the United 

States. In the state of Michigan 

alone, there have been over 

350,000 cases and more than 

9,000 deaths. 

Regardless, a football season 

is being played at Michigan — 

for now. 

The Big Ten joined the rest 

of college football in November, 

stumbling its way through the 

pandemic season. So far, 108 

games have been cancelled or 

postponed. 

All these protocols and facts 

Harbaugh 
praised 
worked 

out for Michigan, until the 

team 
paused 
all 
in-person 

activities 
on 
Monday 
after 

multiple presumptive positive 

tests inside the program. The 

results are now undergoing 

confirmatory PCR testing.

That’s not too surprising, 

though. 

COVID-19 is not something 

to be played around with. 

Yet, it is treated as such every 

Saturday on Michigan’s sideline 

and others around the country. 

Coaches constantly remove 

their masks or face coverings to 

talk to referees, their coaching 

staffs and players. In other 

cases, masks will just lazily 

dangle below their noses. 

Masks are not effective unless 

they cover up the mouth and 

nose, preventing any respiratory 

droplets from spreading. People 

release particles into the air by 

breathing, coughing and even 

talking. 

And yet, coaches remove 

their masks when they talk, 

letting their germs roam free. 

They can put their mask back on 

right after but the damage has 

already been done. 

Infections 
can 
be 

dramatically decreased by just 

covering up your face, even if 

it is for a few minutes. It’s all 

about limiting others’ exposure 

to the virus if someone is 

infected. 

While it may be a charade for 

coaches and benched players 

to wear masks during games, 

the sentiment is still very 

important and it could still save 

people from getting sick. 

There are bound to be dozens 

of times throughout the week 

when masks are improperly 

worn during practices and in 

locker rooms — a problem unto 

itself. But, the least they could 

do is just wear them properly 

for four hours during games. 

Unfortunately, that is just too 

tall of a request for Michigan’s 

coaches. 

Harbaugh 
is 
not 
the 

only 
perpetrator 
but 
his 

shortcomings 
are 
fairly 

noticeable. He wears two face 

coverings during games — one 

normally then another over his 

headset. But, throughout the 

game, both seem to disappear 

off his face at times. 

By 
now, 
millions 
know 

about Harbaugh’s duck-billed 

mask. What does it actually 

accomplish? The short answer 

is nothing. Masks have to 

cover the mouth and nose to 

catch those droplets. It will be 

pretty hard to do that when a 

microphone is keeping it from 

sealing his face. 

Harbaugh’s failure directly 

contradicts his logic of being 

safe.

“Wearing the mask pretty 

much at all times. I use a 

double mask during the game,” 

Harbaugh said.

Maybe the idea gets lost in 

the intensity of the game. But 

how can you spend months 

bragging about your program’s 

protocols when you yourself fail 

to comply with a simple mask 

mandate?

“Everybody’s tested daily. 

We’ve been tested four times 

since Friday and every day 

before that,” Harbaugh said. 

“So you’re saying during the 

game, that’s considered to be 

a clean field. Even if they’re a 

presumptive positive the day 

before the game, night before 

the game, they’re not allowed to 

play, which we’ve had, too.”

There’s a lot of backwards 

logic 
in 
there. 
Testing 
is 

effective in tracking the virus 

but it does just that. All a test 

does is tell a person if they are 

infected or not at that moment. 

They do not cure the disease or 

stop the spread. 

COVID-19 can take days to 

incubate in someone’s body, so 

a person can be negative one 

day and positive a few days 

later. Harbaugh seems to think 

he is living in a utopia where a 

negative means the individual 

is immune for that day and is 

good to go. 

You’d think that five canceled 

or 
postponed 
games 
and 

counting in the Big Ten alone — 

where all teams are tested daily 

— would alert him to the flaws 

in that logic. 

Precautions 
are 
still 

necessary even if the entire 

team is tested multiple times. 

The best way to prevent the 

spread is still by wearing a 

mask. So what does the team 

still need to do on the sideline 

and in the locker room? Wear a 

mask. 

Regardless 
of 
Harbaugh’s 

rationale, it is a problem.

And 
Harbaugh 
does 
not 

deserve 
to 
be 
singled 
out 

because he is not the only 

coach at Michigan or in college 

football to fail to wear a mask 

correctly. But, he is in the 

spotlight as a big-time college 

football 
coach 
at 
a 
major 

university. Millions tune in 

on Saturdays and he should be 

setting a better example for 

those at home. 

Eight months into a pandemic 

that is killing and hospitalizing 

hundreds of thousands, millions 

are still failing to don masks 

appropriately 
and 
listen 
to 

medical professionals; wearing 

a mask is not something that 

can be messed around with. 

College coaches need to be 

setting a better example for 

everybody. They have a huge 

responsibility to wear masks 

properly, whether they asked 

for it or not. 

Harbaugh agreed to a seven-

year $52 million contract with 

the University of Michigan to 

be their head coach. As a former 

player at Michigan, he knew 

what was going to be asked of 

him, whether it was producing 

a good product on the field or 

being the face of the university. 

Harbaugh 
accepted 
the 

responsibility and now must 

confront his shortcomings. 

Michigan 
athletics 
has 

good COVID-19 protocols and 

testing in place. But, as revealed 

Monday, that only does so 

much. Harbaugh had been very 

good about making his team 

wear masks. But at least on 

the sidelines, he and his staff 

obviously failed. 

It’s 
impossible 
to 
know 

whether the lack of mask-

wearing 
on 
the 
sideline 

Saturday contributed to cases 

within the program, but it 

certainly didn’t help. 

Watching Harbaugh march 

up and down the sideline, 

failing to comply with his own 

rules and expectations is an 

embarrassment. 

Harbaugh 
begged 
for 
a 

season amidst a global health 

crisis. Now he needs to face the 

music and listen to what the 

doctors have been saying for 

months.

As the season stands on the 

brink of cancellation, the least 

he could do is try.

Michigan Football coach Jim Harbaugh’s incorrect mask-wearing brings the shortcomings of pandemic prevention plans into clear focus.

The Wolverines aren’t excited about Michigan football either

A.J. Henning stopped in his 

tracks, spotting the underthrown 

ball from Cade McNamara and 

pulled up. He stuck his hands 

out and leapt, stretching over 

the defender 

and bringing 

the ball in 

as he came 

down. The 

third-quarter 

play gained 28 

yards, got the 

Wolverines 

into Penn 

State territo-

ry and set up a Hassan Haskins 

touchdown to cut the deficit to 

just three points a few minutes 

later.

It was one of the rare high-

lights of the game for Michigan 

on Saturday.

And on Michigan’s bench, a 

Daily reporter spotted Jim Har-

baugh telling his players to get up 

and cheer.

If there’s a single moment that 

captures the Wolverines’ season 

from hell, that’s it. Not the emo-

tion on display when an overtime 

Rutgers field-goal attempt went 

wide. Not a loss to a rebuilding 

Michigan State program that 

gifted seven turnovers and the 

Scarlet Knights’ first Big Ten win 

in three years the week earlier. 

Not getting run off the field by 

Wisconsin and not a three-de-

cade win streak getting trampled 

over against Indiana.

No, this takes the top spot. The 

head football coach at an iconic 

football school needing to prod 

his players to stand up and cheer 

as if it was Little League. How 

utterly damning.

“Something like that, saying 

it’s a bad culture, they’re not 

there every day with us working, 

grinding, watching film, working 

out, getting there early, getting 

treatment,” senior offensive 

lineman Andrew Stueber said. 

“So it’s noise that I don’t worry 

about, that I don’t listen to much. 

I play for the guys around me and 

listen to my coaches.”

Later, pressed on the culture, 

he said this: “If the powers that 

be decide there is a problem, then 

so be it. … I listen to my coaches, 

I believe in them.”

Steuber’s right that it’s unfair 

to speculate on what goes on in 

Schembechler Hall in the middle 

of each week. We’re not there. 

We only see the end product.

But if the end product is hand-

ing a directionless Penn State its 

first win of the season, with Har-

baugh needing to tell his players 

when to cheer, then something is 

irreparably wrong.

If the preparation was there, 

Joe Milton wouldn’t have 

wondered who Michigan State 

linebacker Antjuan Simmons is. 

Taylor Upshaw would have had 

more to say about Penn State 

running back Keyvon Lee after 

he ran for 134 yards than, “I’m 

sure he’s a talented back.” 

If the culture was there, then 

Harbaugh wouldn’t have had to 

do his best Jeb Bush impression 

in the third quarter on Saturday. 

The Michigan football pro-

gram finds itself in a hard sit-

uation. Between injuries and 

opt-outs, the top-end talent on 

the roster is all but gone. They’re 

depending on the remnants of a 

decimated 2017 class and a thin 

2018 class to be the upperclass-

men leading the team. They’re 

subject to intense COVID-19 

protocols and — though they 

haven’t needed to go on pause — 

offensive line coach Ed Warinner 

made reference last Wednesday 

to guys missing time because of 

contact tracing.

That’s all real, and there’s 

every chance the season would 

have gone differently if not for a 

global pandemic out of anyone’s 

control.

But every FBS program in 

the country is dealing with the 

same issues on some level. And 

this season — and all the baggage 

that came with it — is exactly 

what Jim Harbaugh very publicly 

asked for.

“We’re gonna be ready to play 

a game in two weeks,” he said 

on Sept. 5. “Get the pads on and 

our guys have trained without a 

pause since June 15. So that’s our 

position. We’re ready to play as 

soon as we possibly can.”

He said those words at a 

protest to which he showed up, 

marched on the Diag and public-

ly went against his boss’s boss, 

the University president. And for 

what?

“Getting better every day,” 

Stueber said, when asked what 

there was left to play for. “Obvi-

ously we still have the big team, 

OSU, at the end of the year. We 

just need to click on all cylinders 

and we’re in contention for that 

game.”

Setting aside the almost laugh-

able notion that Michigan can 

compete with Ohio State right 

now, it’s hard to imagine that 

University administrators aren’t 

asking themselves the same 

question right now. 

“That’s much more of a med-

ical decision and it’s much more 

of a University responsibility 

than it is a football coach’s deci-

sion” University president Mark 

Schlissel said in October, when 

asked about Harbaugh’s antics. “I 

didn’t play professional football 

and coach a college team and 

coach a pro team, and Jim didn’t 

go to medical school and do a 

residency and become a licensed 

physician.”

What is he getting out of this 

arrangement right now? There 

are no fans in the stands, and 

it’s hard to imagine there would 

be many if that were allowed. 

Nobody is making donations 

based on a 2-4 trainwreck of a 

football season. This is another 

headache in a semester full of 

them, nothing more.

You could say on that day in 

September that Michigan was 

motivated to play a season if it 

got that chance. What exactly 

happened between then and that 

moment late in the third quarter 

on Saturday is hard to say, but it 

wasn’t anything good.

The program looks broken, 

the players frustrated and tired. 

There are three games left, and it 

would be an act of mercy if they 

could hit fast forward.

You’d say the misery reached 

its bottom on Saturday when 

Harbaugh needed to tell his 

players to get up and cheer, but 

Michigan has shown an uncanny 

ability to sink to lower and lower 

depths each week. 

Lord only knows what the 

next three games have in store.

Michigan’s freefall season reached a new low on Saturday, falling to a Penn State team which entered the day with an 0-5 record on the year.


First, Michigan lost to a 

Michigan State team in Year 
One of a new coach. Then it 
lost to a team it hadn’t lost 
to in 30 years. Then, a week 
after losing to Wisconsin in 
the biggest loss in Michigan 
Stadium history, it took three 
overtimes to beat conference 
bottom-feeder Rutgers.

On Saturday, the lows 

kept coming. This time, the 
Wolverines (2-4) handed Penn 
State (1-5) its first win of the 
season, 27-17, the second time 
this year a team’s first win 
came against Michigan. 

A group of Nittany Lions 

took a picture on the field 
afterwards, an empty Big 
House behind them, the 
third team in three games 
to celebrate on the maize 
‘M.’ The Wolverines were 
long gone from the field 
by then, left only with the 
crushing weight of another 
disappointment.

When Jim Harbaugh was 

asked after the game what 
his team’s mood was after 
the loss, he could conjure up 
just four words: “I mean, it’s 
disappointing.” At this point 

in a season full of questions, 
it’s one of the few answers 
Michigan has.

The Wolverines’ last gasp 

came on their second failed 
fourth-down attempt of the 
game with just over five 
minutes left in the fourth 
quarter — a quarterback 
sneak with junior Joe Milton, 
who started the game as the 
backup quarterback, under 
center when he’d been in the 
shotgun practically every 
other play. Milton was stuffed. 
On Michigan’s first fourth-
down attempt in the first 
quarter, sophomore Cade 
McNamara was nearly picked 
off on a passing attempt.

“In the first half, we just 

weren’t able to extend the 
drives,” Harbaugh said. 
“Had some third-and-short 
opportunities and then Penn 
State was able to convert their 
third-and-shorts, thought that 
was also, when I said we’re 
not getting the stop at the 
critical time and not getting 
the first down to sustain the 
drive offensively, that was a 
big part of the game.”

With Penn State’s top three 

running backs all out due 
to injuries, it found a new 
spark plug in true freshman 
Keyvone Lee. Lee finished 

with 134 yards on 22 carries, 
including 39 yards on the 
Nittany Lions’ opening 
drive, 44 yards on a fourth-
quarter touchdown drive that 
extended Penn State’s lead to 
10 and 33 yards on the final 
drive of the game, in which 
the Nittany Lions drove deep 
into Michigan territory before 
opting to kneel out the clock.

Junior running back Hassan 

Haskins was a similar catalyst 
for Michigan, finishing with 
101 yards on 17 attempts, 
including a 59-yard rush on 
a first-quarter touchdown 
drive. But the rest of the 
Wolverines’ offense seemed 
discombobulated — a 
problem only made worse 
by McNamara hurting his 
shoulder during a goal-line 
play in the first quarter, which 
caused problems all game and 
led Michigan to twice turn to 
Milton.

Both teams traded field 

goals in the third quarter after 
promising drives that stalled 
out. Then, the offenses found 
life in the fourth quarter. 
First it was the Wolverines, 
buoyed by an acrobatic catch 
by freshman wide receiver 
AJ Henning and topped off 
with a two-yard touchdown 
run by Haskins. Then the 

Nittany Lions followed with 
a touchdown of their own 
thanks to 49 rushing yards 
from Lee.

By then, it was too little, too 

late for Michigan.

The Wolverines’ chances of 

going even .500 are slipping 
away. A reporter asked after 
the game if Michigan’s players 
felt like their backs were 
up against the wall. But for 
that to happen, there would 
have to be some semblance of 
suspense, some semblance of 
something left to play for.

Senior tackle Andrew 

Stueber maintained that there 
was. 

“We have the big team, OSU, 

at the end of the year,” he said. 
“And we just need to click on 
all cylinders and I think we’re 
in contention for that game. 
We’ve got Maryland too and 
so we’ve gotta come together, 
come every day and play.”

But the days have passed 

when the Wolverines have 
been true contenders against 
Ohio State, and even a win 
against Maryland (a team 
Penn State lost to) is no 
guarantee.

Every week, it seems, is 

a new basement for this 
program. Then the bottom 
falls out again.
