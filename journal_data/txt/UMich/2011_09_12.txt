Diag candlelight vigil
commemorates 9 11

michigandailycom

Hundreds gather at
student-organized
memorial event
By ALYSSA ADLER
Daily Staff Reporter
Flickering candles dotted the crowd
on the Diag last night, as several hun-
dred students gathered at the campus
wide ceremony to commemorate the
tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001
terrorist attacks.
LSA seniors Chris Dietzel and Jenna
Weinberg spearheaded the event after
they realized there was no official 9/11

campus commemorative event sched-
uled for yesterday.
"(Jenna) and I both agreed that it
was necessary and decided to take it
upon ourselves (to) step forward and
have the service we all wanted," Diet-
zel said.
The 30-minute vigil began with a
short introduction by Dietzel, who
emphasized the importance of inspir-
ing change in the world.
"Our goal for tonight's memorial is
first and foremost to remember and
recognize all of the lives lost because of
the September 11 attacks," he said. "But
also we are here as a campus united to
strive to obtain respect, understanding
and peace."

Dietzel's address was followed by
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
sophomore Shea Rennee singing the
national anthem. Vice President of Stu-
dent Affairs E. Royster Harper spoke
next on the steps of the Hatcher Gradu-
ate Library and told the crowd that she
stood in the exact same spot 10 years
ago when students congregated on the
night of the attacks.

A NIGHT YOU'LL NEVER FORGET

LOCAL BUSINESSES
A2 landmark,
Liberty St.
Borders to
close today
Future of company
still unknown
ByANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Ann Arbor-based Borders Group Inc.
said it will close its flagship location at
612 East Liberty St. today, six weeks after
announcing it would liquidate its 399
stores and all of its assets.
But even as the chain liquidates stores
nationwide and clears stock at discount
rates as high as 90 percent, Borders's
future remains uncertain. An auction
of the group's intellectual property -
including its brand name, website and
customer loyalty program - is set for
Sept. 14. This leaves the possibility that
Borders could continue as an online
bookseller, like the now online-only elec-
tronics retailer Circuit City.
It is unclear if Borders, which
announced its liquidation on July 18,
has received any bids for its intellec-
tual property. The bids were due Sept.
8, according to Borders spokeswoman
Mary Davis. However, she wrote in an
e-mail interview to The Michigan Daily
that she would not comment further until
the information is ready to be made to the
public.
As it nears the end of its liquidation
process, Borders is also entangled in a
pair of legal battles with former employ-
ees and business partners. Davis declined

HALEY HOARD/Daily
Junior quarterback Denard Robinson overcame a poor first half to lead Michigan to a 35-31 win over Notre Dame. Robinson accounted for 98.7 percent of the Wolverines' offense.
obinson Co. stole the show

One-hundred fourteen thousand,
eight hundred and four pairs of eyes
slowly turned toward Jeremy Gal-
lon. They widened when they real-
ized no Notre Dame jerseys were
in the picture they'll remember
forever.
"Oh my god. Where did he come
from?" said one man standing in the
South endzone.

From his
vantage point,
Denard Robin-
son just threw
a pass to no one
in particular
down the right
sideline. Gallon
blended in with
his teammates

on the sideline, until a blue blur
came streaking out of nowhere. Just
like Michigan had.
The crowd was roaring, woken
up from its slumber by a team that
needed waking itself. Every maize
pom-pon beat the air in unison. The
event - the first night game ever,
the largest crowd ever, the antici-
pation building because it seemed

everyone who had ever called Ann
Arbor home was back in town this
weekend - felt larger than life.
Under the lights.
And the game was outshining the
event.
Now Gallon was wide open, run-
ning free.
But Robinson and Gallon had

EAST LANSING, Mich.
MSU licenses new
anti-fraud software
People who try to hide their
identities by changing their fin-
gerprints could run into a road-
block because of new technology
that Michigan State University
developed and is licensing to a
security company.
Engineering and computer sci-
ence professor Anil Jain headed a
team that developed the software.
It's being licensed to Morpho, a
unit of the Paris-based Safran
group, Michigan State announced
Friday. Terms of the deal weren't
released.
"The technology ... can help
law enforcement and border con-
trol officials detect these altered
fingerprints," said university
spokesman Tom Oswald.
Jain says authorities world-
wide encounter people who have
surgery or other "extreme mea-
sures to alter their fingerprints
to avoid being identified by auto-
matic fingerprint recognition sys-
tems."
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
Suspicious male
detained at Kansas
City airport on 9/11
Security agents detained a man
and shut down one of three termi-
nals at the main airport in Kan-
sas City yesterday after detecting
suspicious items inside his carry-
on bag on the 10th anniversary of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The man was stopped about
9:30 a.m. at the Southwest Air-
lines checkpoint at Kansas City
International Airport. Trans-
portation security agents who
detected suspicious items in his
bag asked to examine them, and
he was detained when he refused,
airline and law enforcement offi-
cials said.
The suspicious items tested
negative for explosive materials,_
according to a statement from
the Transportation Security
Administration. A bomb squad
and bomb-sniffing dogs remained
on the scene yesterday after-
noon, and passengers were being
rescreened.
SPARWOOD, British Columbia
3-year-old boy

Police Cpl. Dan Moskaluk said
yesterday that Kienan Hebert
was returned by the suspect to
his home in Sparwood, British
Columbia, after an emotional plea
from his family.
Police say someone called the

told authorities they would find
the missing boy at the home from

where he was abducted.
They believe the suspected
kidnapper brought him back
there. A search is now on for the
suspect.

VIGIL
From Page 1A
The two vigils events suc-
ceeded in bringing students
together, Harper said.
"One of the things that was
clear 10 years ago that is clear
tonight is that we are more sim-
ilar than we are different," she
said.
Relaying a message from
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, Dean of Students
Laura Blake Jones urged stu-
dents to remember and reflect
and to honor those who lost
their lives on 9/11. Jones went
on to recall her own memory of
that day.
"I lived on the West Coast,
and I woke to a phone call from
the East Coast telling us what
had happened, and as a parent
I spent time thinking, 'How are
we going to break this news to
our children?'" she said. "(9/11)
changed our country and our
world and undoubtedly impact-
ed the childhood of adoles-
cents."
After Jones spoke, LSA senior
Annie Sajid and School of Music,
Theatre & Dance student Jonah
Thompson took the podium to
discuss how 9/11 affected their
lives. A Muslim American from
Michigan's Upper Peninsula,
Sajid said she faced fears of dis-
crimination in the wake of the
attacks. But she said her family
didn't let this fear discourage
them.
"My family took this chal-
lenging time as an opportunity
to bridge gaps instead of create
them," Sajid said. "We would
lead Islam 101 dialogues to raise
other's consciousness. I encour-
age our generation to do the

same."
Similarly, Thompson stressed
the importance of social advo-
cacy on any level.
"Think about the things we
say and the things we do, and
challenge the assumptions that
divide our community," Thomp-
son told the crowd. "We have
the potential, and we have the
challenge. All that is left is for
us to rise to it."
The vigil, which concluded
with a rendition of Bob Dylan's
"Blowin' in the Wind,"
was well-received by attend-
ees as well Weinberg and Deit-
zel, who expressed surprise at
the turnout.
"I couldn't be more pleased
with how things went tonight,"
Deitzel said. "Just to see every-
one come together with such
reverence in such a powerful
and inspiring way ... (shows)
how far we've come."
Dental School student Elena
Petrova-Amstutz said in an
interview after the vigil-that she
volunteered at ground zero the
day after the 9/11 attacks. She
emphasized the anniversary's
importance for all Americans.
"I hope that we will never
forget the day and that no mat-
ter where we are - in the U.S.
or anywhere in the world - we
will always remember the peo-
ple who lost their lives," she
said.
Business School senior Jeff
Ong said he felt the ceremony
had an appropriate and reflec-
tive tone.
"Any time something tragic
like this happens, it's always a
good time to reflect, take a step
back and assess how you are
working to affect some kind of
positive change in our society,"
he said.

Obama: 'These past
10 years tell a story
of resilience'
NEW YORK (AP) - Deter-
mined never to forget but per-
haps ready to move on, the
nation gently handed Sept. 11
over to history yesterday and
etched its memory on a new gen-
eration. A stark memorial took
its place where twin towers once
stood, and the names of the lost
resounded from children too
young to remember terror from
a decade ago.
In New York, Washington and
Pennsylvania, across the United
States and the world, people car-
ried out rituals now as famil-
iar as they are heartbreaking:
American flags unfurled at the
new World Trade Center tower
and the Eiffel Tower, and tears
shed at the base of the Pentagon
and a base in Iraq.
President Barack Obama quot-
ed the Bible and spoke of finding
strength in fear. George W. Bush,
still new to the presidency that
day, invoked the national sacri-
fice of the Civil War. Vice Presi-

dent Joe Biden said hope must
grow from tragedy.
And Jessica Rhodes talked
about her niece, Kathryn L.
LaBorie, the lead flight attendant
on the plane that hit the south
tower. She remembered a radiant
smile and infinite compassion,
and suggested that now, 10 years
on, it is time to turn acorner.
"Although she may not ever be
found, she will never ever be lost
to her family and her friends,"
Rhodes said after she read a seg-
ment of the list of the dead at
ground zero. "Today we honor
her by letting go of the sadness
over losing her and embracing
the joy of having known her."
It was the 10th time the nation
has paused to remember a defin-
ing day. In doing so, it closed
a decade that produced two
wars, deep changes in national
security, shifts in everyday life
- and, months before it ended,
the death at American hands of
the elusive terrorist who master-
minded the attack.
"These past 10 years tell a
story of resilience," Obama said
at a memorial concert at the
Kennedy Center after he visited
all three attack sites.

"It will be said of us that we
kept that faith; that we took
a painful blow, and emerged
stronger," he said.
The anniversary took place
under heightened security. In
New York and Washington
especially, authorities were on
alert. Ahead of the anniversary,
the federal government warned
those cities of a tip about a pos-
sible car-bomb plot. Police
searched trucks in New York,
and streets near the trade center
were blocked. To walk within
blocks of the site, people had to
go through checkpoints.
The names of the fallen -
2,983 of them, including all the
victims from the three Sept. 11
attack sites and six people who
died when terrorists set off a
truck bomb under the towers
in 1993 - echoed across a place
utterly transformed.
In the exact footprints of the
two towers was a stately memori-
al, two great, weeping waterfalls,
unveiled for the first time and, at
least on the first day, open only
to the relatives of the victims.
Around the square perimeter
of each were bronze parapets,
etched with names.

Four terror-
related arrests
made in Sweden

Officials suspect.
men linked to
al- Qaida
STOCKHOLM (AP) - Swed-
ish police arrested four people
on suspicion of preparing a ter-
ror attack and evacuated an arts
center in the country's second
largest city, security officials said
yesterday.
The four were arrested in the
west coast city of Goteborg and
were suspected of plotting ter-
rorism, security service spokes-
woman Sara Kvarnstrom said.
She declined to give details on the
arrests and wouldn't say whether
they were linked to the 10th anni-
versary of the Sept.11 attacks.
Kvarnstrom said Swedish
security service SAPO saw no
reason to raise its terror alert
level, which has been at "elevat-
ed" since October.
"Our assessment is that there
is no reason for public concern at
the moment," she told The Asso-
ciated Press.
Swedish tabloid Expressen,
citing an unnamed police source,
said investigators suspect the
men belong to a terror network
with links to al-Qaida, and that
they had acquired, or were trying
to acquire, firearms, explosives
and hand grenades. Security
police declined to comment on

the newspaper's information.
Police in Goteborg said in
a statement they had evacu-
ated the Roda Sten arts center,
located beneath the city's land-
mark half-mile (930-meter) Alvs-
borg bridge, because of a threat
deemed to pose "serious danger
to life, health or substantial dam-
age of property."
Kvarnstrom declined to say if
the arts center or the bridge were
considered potential targets for a
terror attack.
The Alvsborg bridge runs over
Goteborg's harbor to connect the
mainland with the island of His-
ingen. The six-lane passage is a
vital link from the Norwegian
capital Oslo to southern Sweden.
Goteborg police and Sweden's
Stockholm-based counterterror-
ism unit assisted security police
with the arrests.
Henrik Wallgren, 46, says he
saw a Swedish navy combat boat
race back and forth on the river
by the arts center just before he
and others were evacuated from
the center.
"We were sitting on a skate-
board ramp behind the graffiti
wall at Roda Sten," when it hap-
pened, he told The Associated
Press.
Roda Sten is a former heat-
ing plant that was abandoned for
years before being reopened as an
arts center in 2000, according to
its website.

Taliban claims
responsibility for
attack
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Nearly 80 American soldiers were
wounded and two Afghan civil-
ians were kiled in a Taliban truck
bombing targeting an American
base in eastern Afghanistan, NATO
said yesterday, astark reminder that
the war in Afghanistan still rages 10
years after the Sept.11 terror attacks
against the United States.
The blast, which occurred late
Saturday, shaved the facades from
shops outside the Combat Outpost
Sayed Abad inWardak province and

broke windows in government offic-
es nearby, said Roshana Wardak, a
former parliamentarian who runs
a clinic in the nearby town of the
same name. The Taliban claimed
responsibility for the attack.
Eight wounded civilians were
brought to Wardak's clinic, two of
them with wounds serious enough
that they were sent to Kabul. She
said one 3-year-old girl died of her
wounds on the way tothe clinic.
The attack was carried out by a
Taliban suicide bomber who deto-
nated a large bomb inside a truck
carrying firewood, NATO said. It
was unclear how many foreign and
Afghan soldiers were serving on
the base.
"Most of the force of the explo-

sion was absorbed by the protective
barrier at the outpost entrance,"
NATO said, adding thatthe damage
was repairable and that operations
werecontinuing.
Fewer than 25 Afghan civilians
were also wounded, NATO said,
adding that none of the 77 injuries
sustained by the Americans were
life-threatening. Spokesman Maj.
Russell Fox said yesterday that
all the international troops at the
combat outpost are American.

City and 'U' need to share traffic fiscal burden
While many students are unaware of the boundaries
between campus and the city of Ann Arbor, the city is
all too aware of the burden - primarily financial - it
bears as a result of proximity to the University. With that econom-
ic strain in mind, the Ann Arbor City Council passed a resolution
requiring the University to reimburse the city for traffic services
provided for special events, like football game days.

This piece marks the return
of the public editor column
to The Michigan Daily's
editorial page after a more than
three-year hiatus.
For readers with thoughts on
the Daily's special Sept. 11 issue, its
use of anony-
mous sources IMRAN
and writers SMEA
in last week's SYED
Statement cover Public Editor
story or any-
thing else this
paper has done, there's now an
additional outlet for constructive
criticism.
A public editor - the readers'
representative within the editorial
core of the newspaper - serves a
crucial role, especially for a cam-
pus newspaper, which undergoes
massive staff turnover on a regular
basis. I am honored to serve as the
Daily's second-ever public editor.
While I will have no say in pri-
mary editorial decisions or articles
before they are printed, it will be
my job to read each day's paper
and the feedback we receive from
readers. I will evaluate concerns
that are raised (either publicly or
privately), discuss them as needed
with the Daily's staff and write
bi-weekly columns addressing the
more important issues.
A public editor obviously cannot
fulfill his role without input from
readers. It is my hope with this
first column to open up a dialogue
between myself and the average
student reader of this paper. There
is no opinion too trivial or criti-
cal to forward to the public edi-
tor, though I encourage readers to
point out positive things as well.
Believe me, we can learn from
commendation as much as we can
from our mistakes.
When the Daily first created
the public editor position in 2007,

most readers didn't know what a
public editor was, and those who
did, probably dismissed the Dai-
ly's action as yet another attempt
to imitate The New York Times.
To some extent, the latter group
was right. Much like the Times
appointed Daniel Okrent (himself
a Daily alum) as its first public edi-
tor in 2003 following the embar-
rassing Jayson Blair plagiarism
scandal, the Daily also created the
public editor position out of neces-
sity.
I was the Daily's editorial page
editor when we undertook the pub-
lic editor experiment in 2007. We
created the position in response to
a need at the Daily that we were
told by critics - among them Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man - had to be filled. While the
Daily thankfully never encoun-
tered a disaster like the Blair
scandal, there were little mistakes
being made every day, and a pub-
lic editor would help us notice and
account for them.
As I take up this post, I especial-
ly commend the Daily's current set
of editors for taking the initiative
to once again open the paper up to
official criticism by renewing the
public editor experiment. I know
from experience that Daily staffers
are often subjected to completely
unfair criticism. But I don't deny
that there are legitimate mistakes
being made as well. It will be my
aim to highlight such problems
and possible solutions.
In addition to serving as the
Daily's public reditor, I will be
employed as a staff attorney and
teaching fellow in the University
Law School's Innocence Clinic.
While that technically makes me ,
a University employee, readers
should rest assured that my actions
as public editor will in no way be
influenced by the University.

Indeed, the University administra-
tion has been one of the strongest
voices calling for an independent
public editor at the Daily - and
I'm sure you agree that President
Coleman has far more important
things to do than to commandeer
the Daily's public editor.
I believe a successful public
editor should be close enough to
the publication to understand
the challenges writers and edi-
tors face each day, yet far enough
away to feel comfortable throwing
punches. I think I meet this crite-
ria: I wrote for the Daily in many
capacities, but it has been nearly
four years since I was an editor or
played any role in the paper's deci-
sion making.
Today when I walk into the
newsroom, I recognize almost no
one. Yet, because I spent many
years in that very room, I can
understand what every staffer
does as well as account for the
pressures student journalists face
as they balance classes and the
Daily - which can itself be a full-
time job.
I'm acutely aware of what an
immense task it is to put outa stu-
dent newspaper five nights a week.
I also understand that there is
room for improvement in how the
Daily does it. With your help and
feedback, I hope to play a small
part in making this paper better
than it has ever been.
Please don't hesitate to write
letters to the editor, or to contact
me directly.

As part of the agreement, the city will
reduce the amount of traffic control it provides
for football games, focusing mostly on the
intersection of Main Street and Stadium Bou-
levard before games begin. Other areas will be
neglected by traffic control and likely result
in more traffic congestion on campus streets.
Since these changes were not put into effect
for Saturday's game against Notre Dame, the
University will be required to reimburse the
city for traffic services rendered.
The city's reaction is understandable con-
sidering the chaos of game day traffic that
involves both vehicles and pedestrians. It
takes a great deal of manpower and organi-
zation to keep the process efficient and safe,
and the city should not be alone in this task.
However, City Council's resolution implies
that game days are primarily the business of
the University, and that doesn't provide the
full picture.
Football Saturdays bring thousands of peo-
ple to Ann Arbor and create revenue for both
the city and surrounding businesses. Res-
taurants and shops benefit from the increase
of foot traffic and business from out-of-town
shoppers, and the city accumulates money
from traffic tickets as well as other citations
that are issued throughout a Football Satur-
day. While football games and other special

events on campus are undoubtedly University
events, it's impossible to completely separate
them from the city of Ann Arbor since both
parties share the benefits.
In response to the resolution, the city and
the University need to learn to cooperate by
sharing resources. The process of bringing
more than 100,000 people into the Big House
several days throughout the fall semester
cannot, and should not, be properly managed
by the University or the city independently.
Instead, both parties should work together to
ensure that each is contributing proportion-
ally to gain the benefits.
It is crucial that in response to these chang-
es in traffic services by the city, campus does
not become unreasonably jammed and impass-
able on game days. The University needs to
respond accordingly to make sure visitors to
campus, as well as residents, can safely and
easily travel in the Ann Arbor area. Areas that
are losing traffic patrol, like the State Street
areas near Briarwood and Eisenhower Boule-
vard, should be monitored this coming Satur-
dayto evaluate how much patrol is necessary.
Game days involve the entire Ann Arbor
community, and efforts need to be taken by
both the city and the University to allow Foot-
ball Saturdays to continue to be safe and effi-
cient for residents, students and visitors.

Coach (Hecklinski) always says, 'Big players make
big time plays; and that's what I did today:'

touchdown at a post-game press conference on Saturday.

MSA president remembers
campus reaction to 9 11
TO THE DAILY:
As I was sitting here in my office this
morning, the day before I head down to Ann
Arbor for Michigan v. Notre Dame Under
the Lights, I was forwarded a link to your
front page, on which was a picture of a few
of my closest friends from my days in Ann
Arbor (some of whom are also returning this
weekend). The picture was from the student
vigil we held on the Diag the night of the 9/11
attacks, now 10 years ago.
I still remember that day like it was yes-
terday. As the Michigan Student Assembly
president at the time, I woke up preparing to
chair my firstmeeting of the year, and instead
spent the day running from meeting to meet-
ing, working with the University on setting
up counseling centers and class cancellation,
and then working with my friends on the

assembly to decide to hold that vigil and then
organize it in the span of a few hours.
My friends' faces say it all - the pain you
can see Andrew actually feeling, the concern
and uncertainty that Jessica had for what
this all meant and the resolve to do whatever
was going to be asked by Mike. None of us
really knew what that day had meant at the
time, but we had more than 20,000 people
together that night just to be together to
feel together, and to begin to move forward
together. We didn't come that night calling
for retribution, or calling for absolution - we
came together purely for the sake of remind-
ing each other that we are all collectively one
and here for each other as a community at
Michigan. I have never talked to anyone who
was there that night who didn't feel the same
way, and my trust in our future as a nation
continues to be founded largely in moments
like that.
Matt Nolan
2001 Michigan Student Assembly president

What result do you want to create? What will you
do to make that result happen? My boss asks ques-
tions like these when he runs leadership seminars. As
we mark the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks,
we ought to ask ourselves the same questions. We will
respond to the attacks' troubling legacy in many ways.
Some voices will loudly proclaim America's greatness;
a few of these will say that those who do not talk as
they do are not patriots. Many of us will remember the
surprise, shock, anger and disbelief we felt as we heard
the news, saw the images and sat to watch. That day,
the world became a scary place. The attacks became
something we talked about late at night, a somber
subject we followed until someone else appeared and
broke the tension.
Some people remember Sept. 12, 2001 as a day when
Americans rededicated themselves to their communi-
ties, forged new bonds of friendship and, for a little
while, treated each other with kindness. That rosy
vision ignores the dread, paranoia and anger that
seeped into our public discourse over time. We didn't
understand what the attack meant for several weeks.
A few of us didn't even hear about the attacks until the
day after. I didn't.
On the night of Sept. 11, my seventh-grade classmate
told me that something bad had happened in New York,
but he wasn'tallowed to say what. My class had gone on
a retreat to a summer camp, and few of us had phones.
At breakfast the next morning, our school counselor
broke the news: Planes had hit the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon. I raised my hand to ask if they were
passenger planes and whether it had been an accident.
Waiting for the bus that afternoon I remembered visit-
ing the towers the August before. It had been so foggy
that all I could see was the sidewalk 110 stories below.
When my mother told me that the towers had fallen,
my stomach sank. I ran to the TV. CNN was playing the
grainy amateur video of the second impact - the video
they don't show any more. NBC had a satellite photo of

the cancerous debris plume. Every now and then they
showed silent footage of people running from the grey
ash cloud that consumed the streets as a tower fell. The
clip ended with cars and people caked with powder
struggling through what looked like a disaster movie
scene.
The story goes that on Sept. 12, Americans were
united. We certainly were scared. Some of us were
scared together. Where have we gone since? To can-
.dlelight vigils. To peace protests. If people were here
on a visa, they registered with the FBI. Our country
went to war, twice: Eventually our friends went, too.
We chose an African American man to be our presi-
dent. The stock market fell, then rose, then fell again.
Our army surged, twice. Many of us lost our jobs, our
homes or both. This anniversary will lead most of us
to reflect on what has happened. It's also a chance to
think about what comes next.
What do we want America to look like 10 years
from now? Boy Scouts repeat a motto that includes
the words, "I will do my best to do my duty to God and
my country." I hope 10 years from now more Ameri-
cans will be asking themselves how they can best do
their duty to their country. But I don't want America
to be a place where the only answer to that question is
military or government service. Our country is more
than the institutions of national defense, and it is big-
ger than its government. Our country is our neighbors.
It is our towns, our student organizations, our places
of worship, our workplaces and our friends. Our coun-
try is our families. I hope that 10 years from now we
think more often about the people around us, do more
to welcome those who have come here dreaming of
the day when they, too, will be officially recognized as
Americans, and I hope that we spend more of our time
helping each other. What do you want America to be 10
years from now?

with a rendition of the National

of students from Skyline High

Business seemed as usual at the
East Liberty Street Borders loca-
tion on Friday. Discounts rose to
as high as 90 percent, and signs
announced that even the store fur-
niture is for sale. Employees hung
posters broadcasting the deals and
fielded questions from customers
who were confused that the busi-
ness section had been reduced to a
single bookshelf with no system of
organization.
Customers and passersby had
mixed reactions to the store's clos-
ing. Dozens of pedestrians along
East Liberty, taking notice of the
signs advertising the markdowns,
wandered into the store hoping to
find asteal.

he said. "We fought back. We
haven't given up. Our lives have
changed. We live life in a differ-
ent way then we used to."
Hieftje noted that in addi-
tion to the city's memorial ser-
vice, many other ceremonies are
scheduled to take place through-
out Ann Arbor to remember the
9/11 attacks and honor the vic-
tims of the tragedy - including
a vigil on the Diag that was held
last night.
Following his speech, Hieftje
introduced AAFD Chief Chuck
Hubbard, who said he was on
duty at Fire Station One when
the terrorist attacks occurred
10 years ago. After the second
plane hit the World Trade Center
that morning, Ann Arbor's fire
departments were placed onlock-
down and the AAFD's Technical
Rescue Team was put on standby
in case its assistance was needed
in New York to sift through the
rubble, Hubbard explained.
"I'm confident everyone
who died that day will always
be remembered as American
heroes," Hubbard said.
AAPD Chief Barnett Jones
spoke next and noted while there

were hundreds of first respond-
ers who perished in the attacks,
some of the surviving respond-
ers still suffer from the toxic dust
that permeated the air around
ground zero.
"Today, police officers and fire
personnel are dying because they
ran into buildings, disregarding
proper equipment to save lives,"
Jones said.
Jones asked attendees of the
ceremony to hold hands as he
ended his speech ina strong, pas-
sionate tone.
"We stood together as Ameri-
cans, so all across this nation,
and all around this world, let
them see that we're still standing
together," Jones exclaimed. "Let
them know that they can never
take away our freedom. They
can never take away our lifestyle,
they can never take away what is
America."
Inan interview after the event,
Jones said he spoke exuberantly
because he was proud of the
American values he was raised
on.
"I'm proud to be an American,"
Jones said. "There's no better
country than this country."

he said was his fourth or fifth
visit to the store since Borders

announced its liquidation. Had
discounts not been so steep, he
said, he might not have purchased
anything from a selection of
books that had been "pretty well-
picked over by now."
"You wouldn't want to go in
there looking for a specific book
- you probably wouldn't find it,"
Auernhamer said. "But if you're
looking for something that might

might still go in there and find

see Borders close.
"I've been coming in and out

Thousands attend first MS tailgate

Event prior to
night game draws
8,151 students
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
In following withthe landmark
first-ever night football game on
Saturday, the Michigan Student
Assembly also made school his-
tory with its first large-scale tail-
gate held earlier that day.
The "Under the Lights Tail-
gate" held at the Sports Coliseum
from noon to 7 p.m. offered stu-
dents free refreshments, includ-
ing pizza and soda along with the
opportunity to win two sets of
box seat tickets to the game and a
raffle for nine night game replica
jerseys.
MSA President DeAndree
Watson said the event was an
overall success and attracted sev-
eral thousand students.
"We've had a steady crowd of
people that has come through and
got some food and enjoyed some
entertainment, and then they've
gone on to other things, and that's
exactly what we expected," Wat-
son said in an interview at. the
tailgate.
Apart from the upbeat music
reverberating throughout the
building, the tailgate featured a
variety of student performances
by groups such as the Men and
Women's Glee Clubs, FunKtion,
the Friars and Groove. Students
also had the opportunity to have

their faces painted or tattooed
before the game to show their
school spirit.
Watson said MSA held the
event because the assembly
anticipated students would be
out drinking for a longer period
of time due to the late start of the
game.
"We wanted to give them an
alcohol-free venue to be able to
have some fun and get excited
before the game," he said.
Watson also said if there are
night games in future seasons,
students can expect MSA to con-
tinue to hold similar events.
Alys Alley, chief programming
officer for MSA, said she doesn't
think the number of students
who showed up was affected by
the change in venue from the tail-
gate's original location at Elbel
Field. The tailgate was moved
to the Sports Coliseum on South
Fifth Avenue because Elbel Field
was wet from previous rain.
"We were disappointed that
it had to be moved inside, but it
really hasn't cut down the num-
ber of students we've been able to
serve, and we were really expect-
ing this many students to come,"
Alley said at the event. "It was a
lot of fun, and it's really nice we
didn't have to mess with the rain
or anything."
After a long day of tailgating
and with cries of "free pizza" to
everyone passing by, the free food
proved to be a major draw for stu-
dents.
"I came mostly for the free
food and just being around fellow

students," LSA sophomore Noelle
Gibeson said. "Free food is defi-
nitely a big part of it, but I think
we're going to stay around for the
games and sign up to win prizes
or maybe come back."
LSA sophomore Alexa Wright
echoed these sentiments, say-
ing she came to the MSA tailgate
with a friend to get free food and
to have their faces painted.
"I think it's a good thing for
it to be here because I guess a
majority of pre-gaming is if you
know someone at a house or if
you know someone at a frat, so if
you don't, you have something to
do," Wright said. "Anybody can
come."
LSA freshman Danyaal Rang-
wala said he came to the MSA
tailgate to experience the atmo-
sphere.
"It's the first night game, it's a
rivalry and just the feeling here is
electric, and everyone is excited
for it," Rangwala said at the event.
"I came here just to hype myself
up more for the game, and you get
to meet aton of other people who
are just as excited as you."
ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
CELEBRATES NIGHT GAME
Though Saturday's game start-

JED MOCH/Daily
Desmond Howard, former Michigan football and NFL player and current ESPN analyst, speaks at the ESPN College
GameDay on Saturday at Ingalls Mall Howard was named a "Michigan Football Legend" at Saturday's game.

by hosting a free event Saturday
morning and providing free cof-
fee, donuts and fruit for past and
current students.
"With GameDay being out
here, it was a great opportunity
for us to be able to offer some-
thing to alums and students, and
so we created this opportunity for
people to be able to have a place to
come in out of the rain or what-
ever might be happening," said
Steve Grafton, president and CEO
of the Alumni Association.
About 1,500 alumni were reg-
istered for the event, according to
Grafton.
"It's fun to build this atmo-
sphere on a day that's as big as

this," he said. "We have people
from one year old to probably
close to 100, and that's kind of
what the Michigan family is
about."
As the morning progressed,
more alumni began to arrive with
their families. University alum
Jennifer Edwards, a 1992 gradu-
ate and Michigan Marching Band
alum, said she took her kids to the
Saturday morning event so they
could be a part of the Michigan
spirit.
"The kids got to meet the drum
major, which was probably the
highlight of their day," Edwards
said.
University alum David Dye,

another class of 1992 graduate,
said he decided to come to Ann
Arbor on Saturday to see for-
mer Michigan football and NFL
player Desmond Howard, who
was in his graduating class. How-
ard, currently an ESPN College
GameDay analyst, was honored
at Saturday's game with the first-
ever "Michigan Football Legend"
award.
"People offered me several
hundred dollars for parking and
tickets, but I said I just can't do
it because we have to go to the
game," Dye said. "There's not a
price on the first-ever night game
and Desmond being on campus -
memories are forever."

ROHAN
From Page 1A
been working on this play all
summer. Down by three points.
Thirty seconds left. Ball on the
20-yard line.
Gallon runs the slow wheel
route, leaking out to the sideline
and up the field. If the play is
run perfectly, he could surprise
everyone. This time, the only
defender that could've disrupted-
everything ran to cover Roy
Roundtree, who was streaking
across the field.
Eight seconds were left on
the clock when Gallon ended his
sprint at the 16-yard line. Michi-
gan was in field-goal range.
Brady Hoke wanted to go for the
win.
Why the hell not?
This game, by all possible

logical explanations, should
have ended horribly wrong for
the Michigan Wolverines.
Here was a chance to get
Hoke a signature win, add a
chapter to a rivalry.
one hundred thousand-plus
people would never forget this if
Hoke did it right.
And Notre Dame was handing
him the game.
Your mind tells you that 400-
plus yards of offense should
result in more than a 24-7 lead
by the fourth quarter.
In your heart, there is no
explanation for why Denard
Robinson had the ball on the
16-yard line with eight seconds
left with a chance to win. It was
the kind of game you don't want
to explain, but just consume, like
a fine meal.
With a defensive lineman
hugging his ankles, Robinson

isn't supposed to throw a frozen
rope to Junior Hemingway, lead-
ing him perfectly for a 77-yard
gain in the third quarter.
Three plays later, the ball isn't
supposed to pop out of Stephen
Hopkins' hands - as he's about
to be stopped short of a touch-
down - and direct itself neatly
into Robinson's care for an easy
score. 24-14.
Gallon, perhaps the shortest
player on the field at 5-foot-8,
isn't supposed to beat anyone
on a fade route in the endzone.
24-21.
This night's new logic says
otherwise.
The ball isn't supposed to slip
out of Notre Dame quarterback
Tommy Rees's hand as he fol-
lows through on the potential
nail-in-the-coffin touchdown
late in the fourth quarter. Michi-
gan recovered.

The Wolverines had no busi-
ness stopping Fighting Irish
running back Cierre Wood, who
had gashed them, on three third
down-and-short situations in
the second half. But they did.
Inexplicably, Michigan had
a chance - after all of Michael
Floyd's 112 first-half yards, after
not getting any pressure on
Rees, after Robinson played so
erratically in the first half.
By the end, Robinson had
446 total yards, 98.7 percent
of Michigan's offense. But he
had help. History keeps the key
characters in games like these -
Brandin Hawthorne and Jordan
Kovacs's third-down heroics,
J.T. Floyd's goal line intercep-
tion, Hemingway's two jump-
ball catches.
Then there was Gallon, who
had six career catches before
this night.

And don't forget the would-
be hero, Vincent Smith, who
weaved in and out of several
Irishmen, scoring a 21-yard
screen pass for the go-ahead
touchdown with a little more
than two minutes left. 28-24.
"I mean, everybody thought
the game was - nobody knew
what was going on," said Robin-
son, just stopping short of saying
he thought the game was over
when Smith scored.
"Was there still time on the
clock? Like I said before, until
(it's) 'zero, zero' on the clock,
that's the only time the game is
over."
But 80 yards in 30 seconds?
Come on.
Twelve hours earlier ESPN
analyst Lee Corso put on the
Michigan helmet, striking Des-
mond Howard's Heisman pose,
picking the Wolverines to win.
The city was buzzing, the
stadium transformed into the
late-night party Dave Brandon
planned. Howard was hon-
ored before the game. Images
flickered across the screen of
all of the memories he made.
History was blending with the
current team's exciting future.
This first night game was
manufactured by Brandon to
mean something, and Hoke's
team didn't hold up its end of
the bargain in the first half.
So with eight seconds left,
Hoke decided to go for it. He
had two timeouts and eight
seconds to work with.
"We were at least going to
give it a shot to the endzone,"
Hoke said. "Why not go for the
win? I mean, you play to win."
When Robinson lofted the
ball high toward Roundtree,
who was in single coverage, it
didn't matter how Michigan
had got there.
No one would remember
Robinson's shaky start - only
his high spirals to Gallon and
Roundtree, floating against
the Big House lights. Notre

Dame's miscues would be a foot-
note. A detail. Not the story.
Kovacs. Floyd. Hawthorne.
Hemingway. Smith. Gallon. Rob-
inson.
And soon to be Roundtree.
He caught the ball, in the cor-
ner of the endzone, where every
Michigan receiver should dream
of catching a game-winning
pass.
An unadulterated joy released
into the night. Three straight
last-minute wins over Notre
Dame? On last-second passes?
How improbable. Yet, how fit-
ting on this night.
Think about the poor souls
that left with Michigan down17
points. Or with four minutes left,
when Robinson threw an inter-
ception in the endzone. Or poor
Gary Gray, the Notre Dame cor-
nerback who had the best view
in the Big House for Roundtree's
and Gallon's touchdowns.
The record crowd will have
the indelible images of a bunch
of college kids celebrating with
100,000 of their closest friends
and Robinson skipping up and
down the sidelines before run-
ning to that corner of the Big
House where he likes to cel-
ebrate.
As "The Victors" boomed
into the night sky, one man who
can now say he witnessed it all
turned to a group of students he
had never met and offered a bit
of wisdom: "I'm an old (exple-
tive) man, and I've been to a lot
of (expletive) games in my time,
and that was the second-best
game I've ever seen.
"Savor this moment."
The details become fuzzy,
but the heroes and the result? If
you were there, under the lights,
you'll never forget.

Michigan pulled off the same
deal on Notre Dame three years
in a row. He can be reached at

Obama's jobs plan met with
mix of optimism and doubt

Court of Appeals to rehear
affirmative action case

'U' officials say effect
of policy will be
too delayed
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Americans across the country
watched President Barack Obama
deliver his much-anticipated speech in
front of a joint session of Congress on
Thursday - some watching with hope,
others with skepticism.
Since Obama of ic-e
unveiled the Ameri- office
can Jobs Act, Uni- H O R
versity professors H JJI
have shared mixed
responses of hope and caution about
the act. They say the plan could prove
effective but is perhaps too modest or
may not register the country's desired
immediate impact.
University officials lauded Obama's
package of proposals, which includes
the extension and expansion of a cut
in payroll taxes, investments in infra-
structure and schools and aid to states
to prevent mass teacher layoffs. How-
ever, some worry Obama has pandered
to Washington's political gridlock in
suggesting a plan with effects that may
not appear until next year.
Don Grimes, senior research asso-
ciate at the University's Institute for
Research on Labor, Employment and
the Economy, said citizens will need to
wait until 2012 for an economic uptick.
"I think people are looking for this
to turn around the economy in the next
month or two, and I think they're going
to be disappointed because it's not
going to have any effect on the econo-
my for the next three or four months,
and the real effect will be even longer
term," Grimes said.
He emphasized that many fac-
ets of the policy have already been in
effect for some time.
"In the end I sort of realized as I
was listening (to Obama's speech) that
we're just going to go forward with
what we've already got baked in the

cake and that this fiscal policy pro-
gram, whether it's good (or) bad, is not
really going to have much of an effect
on the short term."
Public Policy Dean Susan Collins
said she is optimistic Obama's plan may
improve the economy. The act's "main
pillars," including tax incentives for
small businesses and aid to states, are
"very sensible," she said.
"There was a real focus on some of
the tax incentive pieces and some of
the infrastructure types of expendi-
tures, which have really been support-
ed in a bipartisan way historically,"
Collins said.
She added that she is especially
hopeful about the bill's incentives for
small businesses. Among other tax
measures, the plan will expand cuts in
payroll taxes for small businesses and
provide a tax holiday for small busi-
nesses that hire new employees.
"It's clear that the small businesses
are the ones that are more, kind of con-
strained, and so trying to focus assis-
tance in that area makes a lot of sense,
especially because better job creation
does in fact come from small and medi-
umbusinesses," Collins said.
She also praised parts of Obama's
plan that offer aid to "hurting" states
to prevent teacher layoffs, modernize
schools and repair the nation's infra-
structure.
"If you're trying to do something
that's going to have any impact in
the relatively short run, some public
expenditures need to be there," Col-
lins said. "And the idea of assistance
to state and localities, for example, for
teachers - that's something that could
move pretty quickly and I think is real-
ly important to do.
But while Collins noted that the
plan could reduce unemployment by as
much as 1 percent nationwide within
the year, she said some of Obama's pro-
posals might not be directly linked to
job creation.
"I might have liked to see a little
more explicit tie-in (with) some of the
tax incentives to job creation than is
actually there, so I think that creates a
little more uncertainty in terms of how

much of the incentives will make a dif-
ference," Collins said.
She added that continuingeconomic
uncertainty is among the factors that
will affect the impact of the propos-
als. However, Doug Neal, managing
director of the University's Center for
Entrepreneurial Programs, wrote in an
e-mail interview that the plan could be
key in restoring consumers' faith in the
economy.
"It doesn't appear to be a long-term
fix but may increase consumer confi-
dence, which is key to helping us stim-
ulate the economy," he wrote.
Neal suggested that even if the plan
doesn't prove to be a long-term solu-
tion, it could still stimulate industry in
Michigan and lower the state unem-
ploymentrate currently at 10.9 percent,
according to July 2011 data from the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"The American Jobs Act, if
approved, should provide at least a
temporary increase in employment in
Michigan for construction-related jobs
and may even allow some small busi-
nesses to add some employees more
easily as we enter the shopping holiday
season," Neal wrote.
The plan may also be a boon for Uni-
versity students seeking jobs in Michi-
gan's growing entrepreneurial sector,
Neal added.
"The American Jobs Act may make
more internship opportunities possible
for our students at start-up companies,
and that is one way that can help," he
wrote.
Despite his optimism, Neal
explained more work would need to
be done to make Michigan hospitable
again for entrepreneurs and small busi-
ness owners even if Obama's proposals
spur a recovery for small business.
"Michigan has a tremendous oppor-
tunity to rebuild and be a leader in
innovation and entrepreneurship,"
he wrote. "Making it easier for expe-
rienced entrepreneurs who want to
relocate back to Michigan, and join a
start-up and join the momentum we
are building would be an additional
way we can continue to accelerate our
efforts."

Law lecturer: 'It's not
just unconstitutional, it's
un-American.'
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily News Editor
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
decided today to reconsider its July ruling
to lift the state's ban on affirmative action
- potentially reinstating the prohibition of
considering race and gender in public uni-
versity admissions.
Proposal 2 originally passed in 2006
with a 58 to 42 percent vote, which dem-
onstrated Michigan residents' desire to
prevent preferential treatment based on
race and gender and thus ban affirmative
action. On July 1, a three-judge panel of the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
the ruling in a 2-1 vote, calling the pro-
posal the cause of dwindling diversity on
campuses.
Since 2005, the number of underrepre-
sented minority students at the Univer-
sity has decreased each year despite more
admission offers to minority students and
an increase in underrepresented students
applying to the University. Last year, how-
ever, there was an increase in the percent-
age of underrepresented minority students
in the freshman class - with 10.6 percent
compared to 9.1 percent in 2009. This
could be partly attributed, though, to dif-
ferent ethnicity reporting instructions set
by the Higher Education Opportunity Act.
University Law lecturer Mark Rosen-
baum, an American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer who argued against the ban on
affirmative action in the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals case, said he doesn't sup-
port Proposal 2 because it limits the power
of minorities.
"It's not just unconstitutional, it's un-
American, because it leaves out citizens
of color," Rosenbaum said. "It makes it
impossible to talk about race as one part of
the American mosaic."
He added that Proposal 2 subdues diver-
sity at universities and affects the discus-
sions of race and ethnicity that occur on
campuses.
"Proposal 2 locks out Michigan citizens

of color fromtalking about race asa diverse
student community," Rosenbaum said.
While Rosenbaum said he supports the
consideration of race. in college admis-
sions, he welcomes the chance to address
the court.
"I think the three-judge panel decided it
correctly, but I welcome the opportunity to
present the entire case to the entire court,"
he said.
George Washington, an attorney with
the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action,
Integration, and Immigration and Fight
for Equality By Any Means Necessary, said
BAMN's brief for the case is due on Oct. 11
and Attorney General Bill Schuette's brief
on behalf of the state is due on Dec. 12.
Washington, a plaintiff in the case, said he
expects the case to be heard in the spring.
While Washington said he would have
preferred the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to not re-hear the case, he believes
his cause will prevail.
"I think we're going to win," he said. "I
think they decided to take it because it's an
important case for the entire county. Now
I think there will be a mass mobilization."
Washington emphasized that even if
affirmative action isn't outlawed when
the case is heard, minority students who
would have been admitted in the spring
will be the ones who "pay the price."
Kate Stenvig, a Rackham graduate and
leading member of the Coalition to Defend
Affirmative Action by Any Means Neces-
sary, said today's decision to hear the case
again will spur much activity by support-
ers of affirmative action.
"We're just going to keep fighting until
we win," she said. "We're determined to
build a movement strong enough to win
and increase minority enrollment now."
Stenvig added that BAMN will organize
marches at the University and around the
state as it has in the past. She pointed to
the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court case in which
it ruled in favor of the University's use of
affirmative action in admissions.
"In 2003, everyone was telling us we
couldn't win in the Supreme Court. We
organized 50,000 people to march on
Washington - 20 busloads of students
from the University, and more from all over
the country," she said. "We won because of
that movement and that mobilization."

Displaced residents grow
impatient after wildfires M

1,554 homes
destroyed, 17
people missing
in Texas
BASTROP, Texas (AP) - The
number of homes destroyed by
a Texas wildfire has risen to
1,554 and is expected to further
increase as firefighters enter
more areas where the blaze has
been extinguished, officials
said yesterday. Seventeen peo-
ple remain unaccounted for.
Bastrop County officials
joined by Democratic U.S. Rep.
Lloyd Doggett sought to pro-
vide new information to hun-
dreds of residents evacuated
from their homes a week ago
when blustering wind whipped
up by Tropical Storm Lee swept
across parched, drought-strick-
en Texas, helping to spark more

than 190 wildfires statewide.
The worst of the fires has cons
sumed more than 24,000 acres
in this area 30 miles southeast
of Austin.
While sharing the bad news
thatthetallyofdestroyedhomes
will increase, officials also told
some 100 residents who gath-
ered at a news conference yes-
terday that people would begin
going back into the scorched
areas today. A detailed plan will
allow residents to slowly enter
the evacuated areas over the
coming week as firefighters and
emergency responders ensure
the land has properly cooled,
hotspots are extinguished and
the blaze is contained.
Tensions and frustrations
boiled over at a similar gather-
ing on Saturday when residents
demanded to be allowed to
return to their neighborhoods
to see what remains of their
homes and attempt to salvage

a few belongings. Many people
were given only minutes to
evacuate as the raging blaze
surrounded homes and neigh-
borhoods. Some had time to
only gather a few important
belongings. Others left with
only the clothes on their back.
Still, Bastrop County Sher-
iff Terry Pickering said there
was no immediate concern for
the lives of the 17 people who
remain unaccounted for.
"They could have been on
vacation," he said.
George Helmke, 77, a retired
Delta airlines gate agent, is
scheduled to return to his home
on Thursday. A police roadblock
some 150 yards from his home is
preventing him from accessing
his property even though there
is no fire damage.
"It's almost inhumane and
I'm very frustrated," Helmke
said. "They've had us out eight
days already."

Evacuati on order i fted in
days following Penn. flooding

Thousands allowed
to return to their
homes as waters
recede
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -
Tens of thousands of people
forced from their homes in Penn-
sylvania were allowed to return
Saturday as the Susquehanna
River receded from some of the
highest floodwaters ever seen,
swollen by remnants of Tropical
Storm Lee.
Other residents evacuated
from river towns in New York
and Maryland were waiting for
permission to return as officials
surveyed flooding damage.
In northeastern Pennsylva-
nia, officials lifted an evacua-
tion order Saturday afternoon
for as many as 60,000 of 70,000
residents in and around Wilkes-
Barre. The rest would likely be
able to return later Saturday

and into yesterday, said Luzerne
County Emergency Manage-
ment Agency Director Stephen
Bekanich.
The Susquehanna's level had
dropped to about 32 feet Saturday
morning and was expected to be

feet, Luzerne County Commis-
sioner Maryanne Petrilla said.
Bekanich estimated damage
was in the tens of millions - but
could have been more than $3 bil-
lion if levees hadn't held.
"The levees held," Bekanich
said. "The levees performed mag-
nificently."
Much of the Northeast was
still soggy from Hurricane Irene
and its aftermath a week earlier
by the time Lee's rainy remnants
arrived.
The Susquehanna crested
Thursday at nearly 42.7 feet in
Wilkes-Barre, higher than the
record set during catastrophic
Hurricane Agnes in 1972, and at
25.7 feet in Binghamton, N.Y. The
river reached a 15-year high of

32.4 feet Friday at the Conowingo
Dam in northeastern Maryland.
At least 15 deaths have been
blamed on Lee and its aftermath:
seven in Pennsylvania, three in
Virginia, one in Maryland, and
four others killed when it came
ashore on the Gulf Coast last
week. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Corbett said Saturday state offi-
cials had received reports of five
additional deaths from the storm,
but that the circumstances of
those deaths had not been con-
firmed.
President Barack Obama
declared states of emergency
in Pennsylvania and New York,
opening the way for federal aid.
Binghamton Mayor Matt Ryan
said officials were working on
modifying evacuation orders
issued in flood-prone neigh-
borhoods so that people whose
homes weren't flooded could pos-
sibly return over the weekend.
Some of the 20,000 evacuated
Binghamton-area residents had
begun returning Friday.

"Louie." Summer shows are
now relevant, and our months
on break this year produced a
remarkable occurrence: His-
tory bizarrely repeated itself and
shined a light on our society's
viewing habits.
AMC's "The Killing" debuted
in April, bursting out of the gates
with strong ratings and glowing
reviews. The show, set in Seattle,
follows an investigation into the
death of a teenage girl - a prem-
ise brazenly cribbed from the
short-lived-yet-extremely influ-
ential series "Twin Peaks"(1990-
1991, R.I.P.). Beyond that, their
narratives took completely dif-
ferent turns. Created by master
surrealist David Lynch ("Blue
Velvet"), "Twin Peaks" went
nutso, involving demonic pos-
sessions, dancing dwarves and a
cross-dressing David Duchovny,
while "The Killing" remains
firmly grounded in reality.
Yet, the two shows managed
to suffer nearly identical fates.
"Twin Peaks" wrapped up its
first batch of episodes without
revealing the killer, and audience
frustration led to network pres-
sure, which led to the premature
resolution of the answer in the
middle of the show's second sea-
son, which led to hemorrhaging

Rapper-slash-
cartoonist comes
to Blind Pig
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
Daily Arts Writer
MC Chris has been around the
block. He's sampled a fair share
of the entertainment industry
in the past ten years, with eight
album releases and work on car-
toons like "Aqua Teen Hunger
Force" and "Sealab 2021" under
his belt. Even with this long list
of feats, the musician's act is far
from stale. He hit the Blind Pig
last night with new music, new
animation ideas and the same
sense of humor that's made him
stand out since his childhood.
The performance showcased
Race Wars, the artist's newest
album and installment in the
related skits he weaves through-
out his music.
"There's a pretty huge story
arc that goes across all of my
albums, and Race Wars is just the
latest kind of episode," he said in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily. "There's not a lot I can say
without ruining it, but it's heavily
based on George Miller and his
movie 'Mad Max."'
While he's reluctant to drop
his story's details, the inspira-
tion behind the new album is less
cryptic.
"Race Wars is kind of an exten-
sion of my childhood, which was
filled with 'Star Wars' and G.I.
Joe," he said. "Basically, I don't
want to grow up."
For a lifelong entertainer like
MC Chris, separating childhood
from adulthood is impossible.
"As a kid, I was very much
the same exact person that I am
now," he said. "I would leave my
table if (my family) went out to
eat, and I'd go to someone else's
table and I'd tell them that I'd
tell them a joke if they gave me a
french fry. I think that at an early
age I learned that if I entertained
people, they'd give me something
in return."
Race Wars's content may be

MC Chris doesn't like to separate childhood from adulthooi

based on the artist's early days in
Illinois, but that didn't stop him
from maturing and developing
the album's actual music.
"Race Wars is very organic -
lots of instruments," he said. "We
brought in alot of great folks, like
Superhuman Happiness, and they
made some awesome-sounding
songs for me."
He added, "It sounds like an
MC Chris record, but it starts out
with a very different and foreign
sound."
New music isn't the only trick
up the artist's sleeve. After receiv-
ing fan donations of over $60,000,
he's now working on his own MC
Chris cartoon. With so much time
spent in the animation studio,
Chris is grateful for the chance
to get out and interact with fans
during his tours. Unlike other
musicians, though, touring for
him isn't all fun and games.
"We go to Waffle House, we
stay at the cheapest hotel we can
find, we get kicked out the next
morning by angry maid, and we
drive six hours to the next venue
and do it all over again," he said.
"There's no TV coming out of the
hotel window with me. There's
not a lot of shenanigans or drink-
ing If we getreally crazy, we'll eat
rice or something. We'll eat some

carbs. We'll have a loaf of bread,
instead of a bottle of vodka like
Led Zeppelin used to do."
Professionalism has become
especially important to MC Chris
in the past few years, as he's used
more of his profits to support
charity than to supply his "nerd
cave" with new toys and gadgets.
"I have a nephew who was
born with cystic fibrosis, and as
soon as I found out, I decided to
change the way I do business," he
said. "I devote 50 percent of my
profits to a cystic fibrosis founda-
tion.... When I'm at home, I sell
my possessions to raise money,
and now there's almost nothing in
my apartment. If I buy something
for $45, I eventually start feeling
guilty and think, 'This is $45 for
cystic fibrosis,' and I sell it."
While the artist sees his future
packed with cartoons, music and
tours, his goals for these creations
will remain the same.
"I just want to keep raising as
much money as I can, and I see
the cartoon to get the word out
there about cystic fibrosis and
what people can do to help," he
said. "We can get together. We
can have a good time. Let's do
something good, too. We have all
this money. ... Let's try to stop a
disease."

els, you always know the precise
number of pages you have left
before All Is Revealed - you can
even peek ahead if you're into
that sort of thing.
With television, I'm going to
blame it on the procedural. Crime
procedurals, from "Dragnet" in
the 1950s to the current "CSI"
franchise, introduce, investi-
gate and solve crimes (usually
murders) ina swift 44 minutes

pie.
Twenty years later, American
audiences are still about instant
gratification, and can't handle a
serialized whodunit. We were
robbed of the Further Adventures
of Dale Cooper, so can we try for
redemption with "The Killing?"

July and Hamish Linklater
(TV's "The New Adventures of

During our first night game

uating.
This may sound like your run-
of-the-mill indie dramedy prem-
ise, but the film is much more than
that. "The Future" is cleverly and
precisely written, often laugh-
out-loud funny, and the rapport
of the two stars is pitch perfect.
They achieve a subdued but sub-
lime absent-minded earnestness
that's delightful to watch.
Jason, in his re-examining of
his life, vows to be more alert, to
take notice of the little things of
everydaylife. This is a maximthat
Sophie also follows and a princi-
ple that the movie itself operates
on. Under the film's deliberate
pace and its careful consideration
of the smallest details, every
object, every miniscule gesture,
transforms into a momentous
event. For these characters, the
course of their entire lives hangs
on the film's every moment.
The characters are in a fragile
state and the audience feels this
acutely because the film makes us
feel it: "The Future" continually
undergoes slight shifts in mood,
and always teeters precariously
between comedy and melancholy.
The film's ability to control the
audience's emotions is amazing -
and comforting, in a way. It feels
good to be in the hands of such a

talented filmmaker.
"The Future," despite its seem-
ingly tame premise, doesn't shy
away from dealing with larger
psychological and existential
issues. July takes serious risks -
a cat narrator, for one - but they
are executed precisely, and each
one pays off. The film even wan-
ders into some cosmic, mystical
territory (Jason converses with
the moon at one point), but it all
serves the narrative, and it's all
cleverly done.
Some bizarre things certainly
happen in "The Future," but how-
ever strange the film becomes, the
events are still very real for the
characters, whether we believe
what is happening or not. The film
is also remarkably honest about
its characters, and about life, with
some throw-off lines that offer
more insight than entire movies.
This is a profoundly truthful film.
Sometimes the film's pace
leads to some flat moments, and it
seems to try to deliver a message
that's maybe a little too broad.
But the film is beautifully shot
and smartly directed, and the
strength of the characters and the
performances always rise above
its few mistakes. All in all, "The
Future" is one of the best films of
the year so far.


CONTAGION
From Page 6A
and strife the virus leaves in its
wake. Even the calm and capable
Doctor Ellis Cheever (Laurence
Fishburne, "Predators") puts
his reputation on the line in a
moment of emotional turmoil.
The movie has no real heroes
because every character is vul-
nerable to the virus and subject
to the panic that follows.
This is not to say the best and
worst parts of people don't come
through. In fact, one of the more

interesting characters is one of
the worst - Alan Krumwiede
(Jude Law, "Repo Men"), a blog-
ger with horrible teeth and a
murky thirst for wealth and
power. His story is not only a
meditation on the power of the
media in times of uncertainty,
but it also gives the movie its only
politically charged aspect.
If it weren't for Krumwiede
and his blog, the movie would
have simply been a story about
the government racing against
time in order to protect the
American people. Krumwiede
brings in complications like the

pharmaceutical companies and
is the only character who exam-
ines the idea of profit, giving the
movie a dirtier but more realis-
tic edge.
Throughout the film, Soder-
bergh makes sure to leave room
for discussion similar to his
approach to "Traffic" and earlier
films. He does not editorialize
much and lets the issues present
themselves straightforwardly.
"Contagion" is a rational and
scientific in its examination of
the world and the troubles that
haunt it, but manages to preserve
its humanity and vulnerability.

Robinson's redemption leads Blue

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
It wasn't a perfect spiral, but in a
way, that made it a perfect pass. And
it was the perfect way to complete
Denard Robinson's redemption.
Down by three with eight seconds
left, Robinson, Michigan's junior
quarterback, took the huddle for the
final time in the drive that would give
Michigan the 35-31 victory.
Robinson was leading his sec-
ond final drive. Coming back from a
17-point deficit entering the fourth
quarter, he had gone 3-for-4 and
taken the Wolverines 58 yards for
Michigan's first lead of the game with
1:12 remaining.
Now he had to do it again. Notre

Dame (0-2) used just four plays to
retake the lead with 30 seconds left.
This time, Robinson deferred to
redshirt junior wide receiver Roy
Roundtree.
"He told me in the huddle," Robin-
son said," 'Denard, I got to getit. I got
to getit."'
The play call was a fade route.
Roundtree beat Notre Dame corner-
back Gary Gray. The spiral was a little
loose. The ball floated.
"I threw it up," Robinson said.
"And I knew he was goingto get it."
Roundtree had to readjust his body
and open his back shoulder up.
The ball glistened in the lights,
which were the focal point of a pre-
game focused on Michigan Stadium's
first night game, but that didn't mat-

ter.
In terms of the game, nothing else
mattered.
It didn't matter that Roundtree
hadn't made a catch the entire game,
that Gray was holding Roundtree, or
that the Fighting Irish had left just
half a minute on the clock and 80
yards in front of the Wolverines.
Roundtree jumped and caught
the ball just above Gray's helmet. He
planted his foot. Touchdown.
"Once I saw the ball come off, it
was high," Roundtree said. "Denard
put it up high so I can adjust to it.
Once I came back towards it, he was
still up on me, so I just jumped up in
the air and focused on it and when I
came down, I made sure I my one foot
was in."

The officials reviewed it, but the
114,804 in attendance knew what
they saw: the conclusion to a game
that would seemingly never end.
Robinson had already drove Mich-
igan into Notre Dame territory and
dumped off a screen pass to junior
running back Vincent Smith for a
touchdown.
Then Rees came back and gave the
Fighting Irish the lead with 30 sec-
onds left and Robinson reverted back
to his old self, over-throwingredshirt
sophomore Jeremy Gallon. But the
next play he didn't miss a wide-open

Defense forces turnovers when needed most

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Editor
At the end of the first quarter dur-
ing the Michigan football team's
thrilling 35-31 win over Notre Dame
Saturday, the Michigan Stadium
loudspeakers gave Wolverine fans
virtually their only hope for victory.
Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'
" - a song almost always reserved
for late-game desperation come-
backs - boomed throughout the
stadium, almost apologetically. In
reality, Michigan fans had little rea-

son to believe. The Fighting Irish
were leading the Wolverines, 14-0,
and had just intercepted another
poorly thrown pass by Michigan
junior quarterback Denard Robinson,
who finished the quarter 1-for-4 for
five yards.
And if the offense was bad, the
defense was worse. Notre Dame soph-
omore quarterback Tommy Rees, who
had started just four career games
prior to Saturday, went a perfect
8-for-8 for 94 yards and two touch-
downs on the Fighting Irish's first
two drives. The Notre Dame running

backs also piled up a quick 51 yards
on nine rushes in the first quarter,
bursting through holes the size of the
Grand Canyon. With the exception of
a couple critical mistakes, the Fight-
ing Irish's offensive surge continued
through the third quarter. And after
Rees connected with junior Theo Rid-
dick for a 15-yard touchdown to give
Notre Dame a 24-7 edge with just
over a quarter to play, it was over -
at least for the few hundred fans that
decided they'd seen enough and exit-
ed the stadium.
But it wasn't over for the Wolver-

ines.
"Whatever the situation, we're
gonna keep playing as hard as we
can," senior defensive tackle Mike
Martin said after the game. "We
never quit and we never gave up."
And while it was Robinson and the
Michigan offense that have received
the most credit for the miraculous
comeback, it never would have hap-
pened without several key plays by
the defense.
The defensive turnaround started
in the second quarter. With Notre

Through the night with a light
from above.
A chorus of 114,804 in unison
as the 18 names of Michigan
graduates killed in the 9/11
attacks scrolled up the vid-
eoboards. It was humbling. It
wasbeautiful. Itwas inspiring.
And a decade ago, that
moment - the public and the
players together - didn't hap-
pen.
On Sept. 15, 2001, Lloyd
Carr's Michigan football team
was slated to face Western
Michigan at Michigan Stadium.
In the aftermath of terror
attacks centered on the East
Coast, the game was postponed
until the next week.
Sports, a topic of conversa-
tion any moment of any day,
have always been an escape.
And even they shut down.
Major League Baseball stopped
games for the first time since
the D-Day invasion in 1944.
America was gripped by fear.
People no longer felt as safe fil-
ing into a stadium, especially

one the size of the Big House.
Players felt Michigan Stadium
could be a target.
So for a weekend, it all fell
silent. Sports seemed trivial. The
heartbeat stopped.
But out of the uncertainty,
out of the fear, came a newfound
national unity.
When the Wolverines readied
for their postponed game against
the Broncos, Carr brought his
team out to the sideline to sing
"The Star Spangled Banner." In
previous home games, the team
had stayed in the locker room,
entering after the anthem was
over.
Off the football field, some
struggled to carry on.
Michigan men's soccer coach
Steve Burns, in his second year of
coaching, took his team to Louis-
ville for the weekend.
"It's important for healing
to begin and we need to return
back to normalcy," Burns said on
Sept.12, 2001. "Our players see
a good thing of being together
on the road - being able to take
a mental break, to lean on each
other and start the whole healing
process."
Two of his players knew
people whowere workingnear
towers, but they were fortunate
enough to survive.
Red Berenson, Michigan's
legendary hockey coach, knew,
two members of United Airlines
Flight 175, the Boston-to-Los
Angeles flight that was hijacked
by five al-Qaeda terrorists and
crashed into the South Tower of
the World Trade Centers.
He played with Garnet "Ace"
Bailey, then-Director of Player
Personnel for the Los Angeles
Kings, during his years with the
St. Louis Blues. Also on Flight
175 was Kings scout Mark Bavis,
who played golf with Michigan
assistant coach Billy Powers the
week before.
They were going to training
camp but never made it.
But Berenson didn't want

sports to cease. He wanted Mich-
igan to play the football game
that Saturday. He remembered
playing the Chicago Blackhawks
on the night of President John
Kennedy's assassination.
"(The fans) went crazy that
night like they wanted vengeance
of some kids," Berenson said.
"Sports can be a release for
that."
So when he saw the footage
of the catastrophe in New York
City, Berenson knew sports
needed to be at the forefront of
the recovery movement. His first
order of business was to send his
captains to the Red Cross, asking
how they could get involved with
donating blood.
The unity hasn't died. The
rivalries are just as fierce. The
intensity hasn't died down. But
in the softer moments, the times
of silence, America remembers
the past.
The feeling is different now.
Ten years later, sports are still
a game, but that game is a pillar
of the nation. It's one that won't
crumble.
"It's a show of unity, strength
and resolve to go back (to play-
ing) - the sooner the better,"
Berenson said in 2001. "We can't
spend the rest of our life looking
over our shoulders."
When Notre Dame wide
receiver Theo Riddick crossed
the goal line with 30 seconds left
to give the Fighting Irish its final
lead, a man in Air Force regalia
standing behind in the south
endzone threw his hands into the
air, jumpingup and down likea
kid.
Then came Robinson's pass to
Roundtree. The dagger.
The airman's shoulder's
slumped forward. It's just a
game, but it's his game.
Win or lose, it's America's dis-
traction.

ROBINSON
From Page 1B
touchdowns, it became clear
early that he had to make some-
thing happen. No Michigan run-
ning back rushed for more than
10 yards.
But from the beginning, Robin-
son struggled. He completed just
two passes in the first half and
overthrew a screen pass for an
interception. The throw was sim-
ilar to the one he hit Smith with
for the go-ahead touchdown.
When the team went to the lock-
er room, Michigan had a rattled
Robinson and was in jeopardy.
"I went and talked to him at
halftime and really just needed
to calm him down because some-
times he speeds everything up
and then kind of loses track of
where he is," fifth-year senior
center David Molk said. "He just
needed to calm down and once we
got back out there in the second
half, he was ready to go."
It didn't translate immediately
to the field. Robinson completed
just two more passes in the third
and threw another interception.
As the quarter wound down,
the game appeared over yet again.
Notre Dame quarterback Tommy
Rees' second touchdown pass of
the game put Notre Dame up 24-7.
TURNOVERS
From Page 1B
Dame driving yet again and
threatening to blow the game
open, redshirt junior safety Jor-
dan Kovacs slipped in front of
receiver Michael Floyd on the
sideline to intercept Rees's third-
down pass.
"I think we did a good job of
disguising the defense," Kovacs
said of the play. "I think the quar-
terback thought we were blitzing.
He checked out of it and he didn't
see us drop into coverage."
Added Michigan coach Brady
Hoke: "It was a tremendous play

body then bailed out, and I think

At the break, Rees had one fewer
touchdown pass than Robinson
had completions.
On the Wolverines' first play
after the touchdown, Fighting
Irish defensive end Kapron Lew-
is-Moore grabbed Robinson by
the ankles. Before going down,
Robinson fired a pass to fifth-
year senior wide receiver Junior
Hemingway, coming across
the field behind his defender.
Hemingway went 77 yards to the
six-yard line.
Robinson entered the fourth
with 136 yards passing. Over half
of them came on one throw.
The defense kept Michigan
(2-0) in the game. While Rees had
315 yards and three touchdowns,
he also threw two interceptions
and Notre Dame fumbled three
times.
And it was a Wolverines
turnover that turned Robinson
around. With Michigan on the
one-yard line, sophomore Ste-
phen Hopkins fumbled. The ball
bounced back and right in front
of Robinson, who picked it up and
ran into the endzone untouched.
"Once I handed it off, I looked,
I was like 'what?' "Robinson said.
"And I just grabbed the ball and
ran."
The next time Robinson
touched the ball, he both threw
and ran effectively, bringing
it confused them a little bit."
It was just the second time
all game the Michigan defense
stopped Notre Dame from scor-
ing, giving the Wolverines con-
fidence that they were clearly
lacking early in the game. On
the ensuing offensive possession,
Michigan scored on a 43-yard
touchdown grab by fifth-year
senior Junior Hemingway, tight-
ening the score to 14-7 when it
clearly could have - and should
have - been much worse.
On the next Notre Dame drive,
with the Fighting Irish on the
Michigan 18-yard line and in the
midst of another impressive scor-
ing drive, Rees rolled right, look-
ing for Floyd in the end zone. But
he waited just a second too long,

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson accounted for about 99 percent of his team's offense on Saturday.

Michigan within three with a
beautiful throw on Gallon's fade
route. But Robinson couldn't
shake his demons, throwing
another interception - this time
it was at the goal line with four
minutes left. After the defense
bailed him out again, Robinson
took over with 2:16 left - just
enough time for a two-minute
drill.
"The last drive we had offen-
sively, number 16's ability to
back and jump in front of Floyd to
make the interception.
Just like that, instead of trail-
ing21-7 - or worse, 28-0 if Kovacs
didn't force his interception - the
Wolverines had the ball back,
down by just seven with about
five minutes left in the half. Both
interceptions came on passes
intended for Floyd, Notre Dame's
all-time receptions leader who
finished the game with 13 recep-
tions for 159 yards.
"You can never eliminate a guy
like that or take him out of the
game, but that's something we
tried to do," Kovacs said. "He's a
great player and he's gonna get his
catches and we knew that, but we
couldn't let the rest of the team
beat us."
The two first-half interceptions
were key in keeping Michigan in

elude and evade and step up and
throw the ball, that's something
that we always have going for
us," Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said. "We've done two-minute
drills since we got here in Janu-
ary. We've probably done 1,000
two-minute drills with different
scenarios, different timeouts,
different ones-on-ones, twos-on-
twos because those are the high
pressure - most pressure - situ-
ations that you have in a football
the game, but in the second half,
a fumble recovery set the Wolver-
ines up to have a shot at finishing
off a miraculous comeback.
With Notre Dame up 24-21 and
just over six minutes left in the
game, the Irish were just seven
yards away from seemingly put-
ting the game out of reach for
Michigan. Rees dropped back
to pass, cocked his arm back to
throw, and somehow, inexpli-
cably, the ball slipped out of his
hands without being touched.
There was a scramble for the ball,
and fifth-year senior defensive
tackle Ryan Van Bergen came out
of the scrum with it. It was the
fourth forced turnover for the
Wolverines.
"We did step up and make
some big plays," Martin said.
"Throughout the game we had

knew how to handle that."
Michigan scored but so did
Notre Dame. Three touchdowns
were scored in the final 1:12. Rob-
inson had to lead another come

but a 30-second version.
That's when Robinson, on his +

imperfect pass that led to the
Roundtree touchdown.
It was the perfect victory.

better throughout the game, and
I think we did a really good job
of stepping up and making plays
when we needed to."
The defense clearly had its
struggles throughout the game
(it gave up 513 total yards and
allowed what appeared then to
be the game-winning drive by
Notre Dame with just 30 seconds
left), but the players did what
they had to do in order to keep
Michigan in the game.
"That's the unique thing
about this defense," Kovacs said.
"We're gonna fight. At times we
played well but at other times it
was tough. We just put it in the
past and kept fighting. We knew
good things would happen."
In other words, they didn't

RECEIVER JEREMY GALLON
Jeremy Gallon caught perhaps the
two most important passes of his
young life on Saturday - the first
was a 14-yard fade route in the
endzone that the 5-foot-8 Gallon
had to sky for. "He plays like he's
6-(foot)-7," Denard Robinson said
after the game. And then Gallon's
wide-open 64-yard wheel route set
up Roy Roundtree's game-winning
catch with two seconds left on the
clock. Oh, and he also returned
the only punt return of the night
for 21 yards. Remember the name,
people. One of the smallest players
came up big under the lights.

STEPHEN HOPKINS
So you're suspended the first
game of the season, only to
return for your first game of the
season against a stingy Notre
Dame defense. The running
backs had eight carries all game,
and Hopkins had five of them.
But he couldn't find any room
against the 3-4 defense, running
for just 10 yards. And his best
opportunity, a carry near the goal
line, ended up getting stuffed and
he fumbled the ball in the process.
No touchdown for Hopkins.
Of course, Denard Robinson
picked it up for the touchdown.
