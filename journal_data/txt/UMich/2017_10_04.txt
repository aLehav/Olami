Tuesday morning racist fliers 

were posted outside Stockwell 
Residence Hall, presenting the 
minority enrollment numbers at 
both the University of Michigan 
and Michigan State University, 
insinuating gaps in the average 
IQ of Black and white students. 
This 
correlation 
between 

race and mental ability was 
popularized in the late 1990s 
by Charles Murray, a political 
scientist slated to speak at the 
University next Wednesday.

The forthcoming event is 

sponsored by the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans 
and the American Enterprise 

Institute 
University 
of 

Michigan Executive Council, a 
public policy think tank where 
Murray serves as the W.H. 
Brady Scholar.

The 
event’s 
Facebook 

description says Murray will 
be discussing his 2012 book 
“Coming Apart: The State of 
White America, 1960-2010.” 
The lecture will be followed 
by a Q&A section “at which 
students are encouraged to ask 
tough questions, but engage 
respectfully with the speaker.”

Following incidents of racist 

flyering at the University in 
September, the LSA Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion team 
released a statement disputing 
theories 
of 
biological 

Central 
Student 

Government 
met 
Tuesday 

night to pass a resolution to 
place a charging station in 
the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library. The assembly also 
discussed 
removing 
the 

LSA course guides usually 
sent out to freshmen before 
they arrive for orientation 
due to the amount of paper 
used for a document that the 
representatives argued is not 
often utilized by incoming 
students.

In addition, CSG briefly 

touched on the racist fliers 
found on campus this morning. 
CSG 
President 
Anushka 

Sarkar, an LSA senior, spoke 
on the possibility amending 
the 
Statement 
of 
Student 

Rights and Responsibilities 
to address bias incidents, as 
the current version does not 
have a policy and thus has no 
means to punish violators. 
While Sarkar did not directly 
address the flyers themselves, 
CSG Vice President Nadine 
Jawad, a Public Policy senior, 
mentioned the racist incident 
in passing and thanked those 
CSG 
representatives 
who 

took photos of the racist 
flyers, saying if they received 
updates from the Dean of 
Students 
Office, 
students 

would be informed.

Returning to the assembly’s 

agenda, CSG then allocated 

funding for a charging station 
to be placed on the first floor 
of the Undergraduate Library.

The $699 charging station 

would be paid for solely by 
CSG. 
However, 
any 
costs 

associated with maintenance 
and 
upkeep 
would 
be 

furnished by the library. The 
resolution was written by 
LSA junior Ali Rosenblatt, 
vice speaker of CSG, and was 
passed unanimously 31 to 0.

CSG 
also 
proposed 
the 

possibility of removing the 

LSA 
course 
guides 
from 

new-student 
orientation 

packets. CSG representative 
Zoha Qureshi, an LSA junior, 
proposed the idea and spoke 
on the work she had done with 
Newnan Advising Center to 
implement a reduction in the 
course guide’s production.

“It’s a really thick packet 

of a lot of paper that just gets 
wasted because a lot students 
don’t end up using it,” Qureshi 
said. 

She went on to advocate 

for more student input in 
the matter of removing the 
course guides, as well as 
the reformation of the now-
defunct 
Student 
Advisory 

Committee to LSA Advising.

CSG also used the short 

meeting to recall two Rackham 
representatives 
who 
had 

failed to attend any meetings 
throughout the entire seventh 
assembly. The vote to recall 
was the first in CSG history 
under 
the 
new 
rules 
for 

representative removal.

A 
discussion 
between 
two 

political experts held at Grand 
Valley 
State 
University 
was 

livestreamed to a crowd of around 
40 attendees at the Ford School 
of Public Policy Tuesday night. 
The 
event, 
titled 
“Character 

and Presidency,” featured David 
Brooks, 
a 
New 
York 
Times 

columnist, and Ronald C. White, 
an 
award-winning 
presidential 

historian.

The event began with former 

U.S. diplomat Peter F. Secchia 
presenting 
a 
clip 
from 
the 

documentary “Gerald R. Ford: 
A Test of Character.” The short 
segment 
displayed 
the 
38th 

president’s 
moral 
conflict 
in 

pardoning his predecessor Richard 
Nixon, who resigned in the wake of 
the Watergate Scandal.

Secchia said Ford was able to 

make the decision that cost him 
re-election because he was able to 
naturally see beyond short-term 
results and think about the public 
good. Character was ingrained in 
him, he explained.

“It wasn’t the water he drank, it 

wasn’t the religion he had, it wasn’t

The

Chamber 

of 
Commerce 
is 
currently 

advocating for an amendment 
to the Michigan Constitution, 
which 
would 
change 
term 

limits 
for 
state 
legislators. 

The specifics of the plan for 
revision of the 1992 state law 
remain ambiguous, but those 
behind 
it 
seek 
to 
provide 

for 
more 
effectiveness 
and 

representation of members of 
the state Congress.

According to The Detroit 

News, in 2019, roughly 70 
percent 
of 
state 
senators 

and over 20 percent of state 
representatives’ 
terms 
will 

expire, leaving an abundance of 
seats open for re-election. This 
also invites the possibility that 
inexperienced 
representatives 

will be given the responsibility 
of dealing with intricate matters 
of the previous administration.

The amendment, if accepted 

for reform, would be placed on 
the 2018 voter ballot. On Sept. 
27, the Michigan Chamber of

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

About a dozen students 

gathered 
in 
the

of 

Angell Hall Tuesday night for 
LSA dean Andrew Martin’s 
Student Town Hall, looking 
for 
administrative 
answers 

to recent racist incidents on 
campus.

Almost all the students’ 

questions revolved around the 
campus climate with many 
students 
expressing

Austin McCoy, a Michigan

Humanities 

Postdoctoral 
fellow 
who 

studies protest movements, 
has emphasized only doing 
so when it won’t create a 
confrontation, as he feels the 
safety of minority students is 
paramount.

“As a university, we create 

spaces 
for 
dialogue, 
and 

sometimes that dialogue we 
find horrific and offensive,” 
Martin said. “But it doesn’t 
mean that that stuff has to 
stay up in these settings, and 
I think that’s something that 
would be effective.”

Martin 
said 
he 
agreed 

with those who commented 
on the University’s lack of 
communication on how they 
are handling ongoing issues. 
He also stressed the legality 
of the of the vandalism was 
not up for debate but also that 
it was logistically difficult to 
release details of an ongoing 
investigation.

“To be clear, I don’t want 

to have dialogues about what 
happened 
in 
West 
Quad,” 

he said. “What happened in 
West Quad was ridiculous. 
It almost certainly violated 
Michigan ethnic intimidation 

law, and DPSS continues 
to investigate that event 
and similar events. The 
challenge is that one can’t 
be entirely transparent 
about the investigation 
that’s going on. And all it 
takes is one person with 
a marker or one person 
with a poster and a roll 
of tape to create a lot of 
hurt.”

Students 
later 
asked 

him how seriously the 
administration 
was 

taking demands to rename 
the C.C. Little Science 
Building, 
whose 
name 

honors a former president 
of the University who was 
an outspoken advocate of 
eugenics.

“Very,” 
Martin 
said. 

“We, 
as 
a

a couple years ago for, 
‘How are we going to 
go about thinking about

“As a university, we create 

spaces for dialogue, and sometimes 
that dialogue we find horrific and 
offensive,” Martin said. “But it 
doesn’t mean that that stuff has 
to stay up in these settings, and I 
think that’s something that would

Martin 
said 
he 
agreed 

with those who commented 
on 
the 
University’s 
lack 
of 

communication on how they are 
handling ongoing issues. He also 
stressed the legality of the of the 
vandalism was not up for debate 
but also that it was logistically 
difficult to release details of an 

ongoing investigation.

“To be clear, I don’t want

Michigan 

ethnic intimidation law, and

And all it takes is one person with

a lot of hurt.”

Students later asked him how 

seriously 
the 
administration 

was taking demands to rename 
the C.C. Little Science Building, 
whose name honors a former 
president of the University who 
was an outspoken advocate of 
eugenics.

“Very,” Martin said. “We, 

as a University, put a process 
in place a couple years ago for, 
‘How are we going to go about 
thinking about renaming or 
removing a name from one of 
our buildings?’ And that was 
a thoughtful process, that 
was an academic process with 
the idea of, ‘Let’s collect all 
the information, let’s make a 
reasoned decision.’ “

That 
information 
was 

collected by LSA students 
and faculty and compiled into 
a report. Martin said that 
report is now being reviewed 
by the President’s Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

History, which can revise or 
add to the report before a final 
decision is made by University 
President Mark Schlissel and 
the Board of Regents — likely 
within the next year.

“This is not some sort of, 

‘We’re gonna have a process 
so this thing goes away,’ and 
it just flies away,” he said. 
“There’s going to be very 
sustained engagement on this 
particular issue. We don’t 
know about timing, partly 
because we don’t know how 
long it’s going to take them to 
get the information they need 
to make a decision. My guess is 
this is something that will be 
resolved this academic year.”

LSA senior Ryan Gillcrist 

said despite the relatively poor 
attendance of the event, he 
appreciated the opportunity to 
directly connect with Martin 
in an informal setting.

“It’s always hard to get 

people to these types of events, 
even with free food, but it’s 
great to be able to ask him 
questions in person,” he said.

just 
his 
wonderful 
parents,” 

Secchia said. “It was the fact that 
he grew up in a community that 
cares. Judging by the numbers, 
people still care.”

The audience was subsequently 

introduced to Brooks, White and 
moderator 
Gleaves 
Whitney, 

director of GVSU’s Hauenstein 
Center for Presidential Studies.

When 
asked 
about 
the 

relationship between character 
and leadership, Brooks recalled 
a time when he was passionately 
arguing 
policy 
with 
former 

President George W. Bush. He 
said though Bush was fuming at 
times, the president reminded 
himself that he was enjoying the 
argument because his staffers 
would never directly engage with 
him.

“You’re love-bombed all day 

by everybody,” Brooks said. “One 
of the big character challenges in 
being a leader is how do you deal 
with that love bomb and how does 
it not have an effect on you. And 
I have never seen anybody really 
immune.”

White argued seeing beyond 

what is said and looking at 
the 
speaker’s 
character 
can 

reintroduce civility in public 

discourse and revive engagement 
between 
people 
who 
have 

different views.

“I think we might want to be in 

that place where we can disagree 
with someone’s particular policy 
… but we can see and value their 
character,” White said. 

Perhaps the most pertinent 

question 
to 
students 
in 

the audience was the role 
universities 
should 
play 
in 

building 
character. 
While 

lamenting the loss of “in loco 
parentis” 
after 
the 
student 

movements 
in 
the 
1960s, 

particularly surrounding civil 
rights and issues of racism on 
campus, White recommended 
students read biographies of 
great historical figures to explore 
their moral development.

“(Biographies 
are) 
very 

different from just doing a survey 
class in American history or 
European history,” White said. 
“We need to watch the formation 
of character in individuals and 
lift that up as models for young 
men and women.”

Brooks concurred, observing 

that students these days have 
an abundance of what he called 
“résumé words” — traits that 
make them attractive to employers 
— they lack in eulogy words such 
as “honorable”, “courageous” and 
“capable of great love that truly 

shows character.”

“We give (students) a series of 

empty boxes, partly because we’ve 
grown up in a culture … where the 
emphasis is all about liberation 
and emancipation,” Brooks said. 
“People get lost in their freedom, 
and they just don’t know how to 
bind (themselves), and I think 
that’s a national failure, not just a 
university failure.”

Reiter said she was glad that, in 
a political atmosphere that at 
times seems to reward dishonest 
individuals, well-read men like 
Brooks and White shared her 
belief in morality.

“I feel so strongly in the 

importance of morality and 
responsibility and leadership, and 
to have my feelings supported by 
people as verbal and incredible 
was very heartening,” Reiter said.

Others were critical of the 

speakers’ views. Public Policy 
student Kristina Kaupa pointed 
out that though the event title 
evoked the abrasive personality 
of the incumbent president, the 
speakers seldom referred to 
him. Brooks and White tended 
to focus on the moral character 
of presidents like Lincoln, Grant, 
Truman and the two Bushes.

“I was surprised that we didn’t 

spend more time talking about 
the current presidency and a 

little shocked that they weren’t 
more willing to engage with 
that conversation,” Kaupa said. 
“They still didn’t really challenge 
the character of the current 
presidency or even talk about the 
character of Hillary Clinton as a 
potential alternative.”

Kaupa also found issue with 

the speakers’ praise of the effects 
of mothers on sons. She said this 
implied women cannot have 
strong moral character because 
daughters tend to get along with 
their fathers better instead of 
their mothers. 

“In 
my 
own 
personal 

experience, the strong women 
in my life never had an easy 
relationship with their mother,” 
Kaupa said. “It takes a strong 
woman to raise a strong woman, 
and those personalities do not 
always match.”

Public Policy student Jackson 

Voss criticized what he perceived 
as the speakers’ assumption 
that young people do not know 
anything about character.

“That’s a weird opinion to have 

because it’s not our generation 
that’s exhibiting all the bad 
character in government,” Voss 
said. “It’s not people our age that 
tend to be the problem.”

organizations and individuals

Rich 
Studley, 
president 

and CEO of the Michigan 
Chamber of Commerce, issued 
a statement explaining the vote 
and describing how the reform, 
though still under discussion, 
might 
improve 
internal 

workings of the legislature.

“This 
government 

reform 
effort 
could 
focus 

on revising term limits and 
other changes to improve the 
effectiveness, 
accountability 

and transparency of the state 
legislature. The specifics of 
this government accountability 
proposal 
remain 
to 
be 

determined. 
Chamber 
staff 

will report back to the Board of 
Directors in January 2018,” he 
wrote.

While 
38 
state 
senators 

currently represent Michigan, 
because of rigid term limits, 26 
will not have the opportunity 
for re-election in 2018. Within 
Michigan’s 110 House seats, 24 
will be available for change in 
candidacy, allowing for a 21.8 
percent turnover rate — the 
second highest among all state 
Houses.

Specifically, 19 Republicans 

and seven Democrats will be 
forced to vacate their seats 
in the state Senate, while 13 
Democrats and 11 Republicans 
will do the same in the state 
House.

While term limits do face 

opposition among some policy 
makers, 
Patrick 
Anderson, 

author 
of 
the 
1992 
term 

limits 
amendment, 
argued 

that 
term 
limits 
provide 

generational 
representation 

and allow frequent waves of 
new legislators to address the 
needs of a changing society. 

He also stated “a vast majority 
of citizens are not interested 
in fixing a portion of the state 
constitution that is not broken.” 

“The basic message citizens 

have given their government for 
200 years now has been to have 
a Legislature full of people who 
represent citizens,” Anderson 
told The Detroit News. “To do 
that effectively, you want to 
make sure that those legislators 
are periodically drawn from 
the citizenry, and term limits 
ensures that.”

At the heart of the debate is the 

controversy as to whether term 
limits encourage lawmakers to 
vote in agreement with desires 
of their constituents or if their 
votes face more persuasion 
from special interest groups 
within the legislature. 

Engineering 
sophomore 

Lincoln Merrill, publicity chair 
for the University of Michigan’s 
College Republicans, stated he 
feels term limits are beneficial 

and they should not change in 
the state of Michigan.

“I think that term limits 

should be instituted in every 
state legislature and every 
state and in the national 
legislature,” he said. “You’ve 
seen 
the 
backlash 
against 

the establishment and the 
career-sort of politicians that’s 
happened in the past year, 
and it just goes to show a lot 
of the people who are in office 
nationally for decades and 
decades at a time, this doesn’t 
go for all of them, but there’s a 
possibility that they’re just in it 
for the job and the money and 
power, and they don’t necessarily 
have your good in mind. With 
regards to Michigan in general, I 
don’t think they should change it 
at all … I think it’s a good amount 
of time where you can get 
something done, (and) you can 
move on after that.”

College Democrats did not 

respond for a comment.

superiority 
of

directly 

addressing the “myths” of the 
“The Bell Curve.”

“Over the past 100 years, 

following 
a 
longer 
trend 

of 
scientific 
racism, 
some 

researchers 
have 
sought 
to 

demonstrate that there is a 
quantifiable correlation between 
racial group and mental ability, 
and 
that 
IQ 
(intelligence 

quotient) is a singular and innate 
biological trait,” the statement 
read. “This has never been 
proven. Nevertheless, it is one of 
the oldest cards in the racist deck, 
dating back to the early 1900s 
when the modern intelligence 
test was invented.”

After Murray’s visit to the 

University 
was 
announced, 

Public Policy student Jackson 
Voss, chair of the Ford School of 
Public Policy’s Student Affairs 
Committee, made a post as 
the Public Policy School’s SAC 
denouncing the event. In an 
interview Tuesday, he urged 
other student leaders and student 
government figures to do the 
same.

“I think that for me and 

for others the way that I have 
started to think about it is that 
we actually do serve a public-
facing role,” Voss said. “I think 
it’s our responsibility to make 
statements about things that are 
happening, especially things that 
are happening to our classmates 
and to the people we say were 
representing in these meetings 
and in our advocacy and in our 
activities.”

Voss 
said 
he 
strives 
to 

remain bipartisan in his role 
as a student leader but believes 
the ideas Murray promotes are 
problematic, not partisan.

“He put on this public persona, 

but the truth is the ideas he 
prescribes to and promotes are 
explicitly 
white 
supremacist, 

or anti-women,” he said. “He is 
pretty forthright with it, believes 
that white men are intellectually, 
socially, psychologically, superior 
to other groups of people, and 
that is the definition of being a 
white supremacist.”

If the University’s chapter 

of College Republicans want to 
distance themselves from white 
supremacists, Voss argues they 
must take direct action.

“If 
Republicans 
and 

Conservatives and groups like 
AEI are generally concerned 
about these things then they 
need to prove it, by not bringing 
speakers like Charles Murray to 
campus,” he said.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Lincoln Merrill, publicity chair 
of College Republicans, says 
Republicans have been making 

an effort to distance themselves 
from the recent expressions of 
racism and white supremacy on 
campus.

“All of the posters that came 

out this morning, those people 
are ridiculous,” Merrill said. 
“We do not agree with them at 
all. With the Charles Murray 
event, we’re just trying to have an 
event.”

LSA 
senior 
Ben 
Decatur, 

co-chair 
of 
the 
American 

Enterprise Institute Executive 
Council at the University, wrote 
in an email the Murray event 
will 
continue 
as 
scheduled, 

adding that Murray was invited 
specifically to discuss the 2016 
election in the context of his book 
“Coming Apart.”

“Murray’s 2012 book ‘Coming 

Apart’ in many ways predicts the 
rise of a candidate like Trump,” 
Decatur said. “In the book, 
Murray demonstrates that a new 
upper class and a new lower class 
have diverged so far in behaviors 
that the upper class is completed 
isolated from the culture and 
struggles 
of 
less 
fortunate 

Americans.”

According 
to 
Decatur, 

Murray’s 
theories 
on 
race 

and mental ability are often 
misconstrued.

“As far as ‘The Bell Curve,’ 

Murray has denounced the ‘alt-
right’ as vile and any attempts 
to use his scholarship to justify 
this so called philosophy,” he 
said. “Murray, a libertarian, even 
opposed Trump in 2016.”

Voss said there has been talk 

of protesting the Murray event, 
though he does not know of any 
concrete plans at the moment. 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the sponsor’s 
organization has been working 
with the Center for Campus 
Involvement to ensure student 
safety is a priority.

“The student organizations 

sponsoring Charles Murray’s visit 
to campus have been working 
with the Center for Campus 
Involvement, part of Student 
Life, and the Palmer Commons 
event staff to plan for this event,” 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email. 
“This is the normal process for 
student groups that host high-
profile speakers on campus. Those 
plans are still being finalized and, 
as always, community safety is 
one of the critical elements being 
considered.”

Decatur invited students who 

oppose Murray to come to the 
event and engage in discussion 
with him.

“Dr. 
Murray 
will 
devote 

most of his time to hearing 
from audience members and we 
encourage students who disagree 
with Murray’s worldview to 
listen to him firsthand and 
respectfully and frankly engage 
with him during this event,” he 
said.

was an academic process with 
the idea of, ‘Let’s collect all 
the information, let’s make a 
reasoned decision.’ “

That 
information 
was 

collected 
by 
LSA 
students 

and 
faculty 
and 
compiled 

into a report. Martin said the 
report is now being reviewed 
by the President’s Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

History, which can revise or 
add to the report before a final 
decision is made by University 
President Mark Schlissel and 
the Board of Regents — likely 
within the next year.

“This is not some sort of, 

‘We’re gonna have a process 
so this thing goes away,’ and 

it just flies away,” he said. 
“There’s going to be very 
sustained engagement on this 
particular issue. We don’t know 
about timing, partly because 
we don’t know how long it’s 
going to take them to get the 
information they need to make 
a decision. My guess is this is 
something that will be resolved 
this academic year.”

LSA senior Ryan Gillcrist, 

who is also the LSA Student

attendance of the event, he 
appreciated the opportunity to 
directly connect with Martin 
in an informal setting.

“It’s always hard to get 

people to these types of events, 
even with free food, but it’s 
great to be able to ask him 
questions in person,” he said.

TOWN HALL

Last week’s protests were 

effective 
precisely 
because 

they were disruptive. It is 
not every day that the Diag 
is populated with dozens of 
students for hours on end, some 
holding umbrellas to block the 
heat and others delivering 
food and water. The students 
who blocked the intersections 
of bus routes near the C.C. 
Little bus station sought to 
parallel the “inconveniences” 
racism and microaggressions 
pose for students of color 
on 
a 
daily 
basis. 
Though 

their protest lasted merely 
an hour, they had an impact 
that “inconvenienced” a large 
proportion of campus.

Intentionally 
disruptive 

student protests are some of 
the most effective ways to 
enact 
much-needed 
change 

on our campus and beyond. 
And in cases such as these, 
the nature of the disruption 
conveyed the message of the 
protest, especially to student 
demographics who otherwise 
would 
not 
understand 
the 

disruptions students of color 

on campus deal with regularly.

As such, these types of visible 

protests not only force passersby 
to think about the issues the 
protests are addressing, but 
they 
also 
start 
important 

conversations. When routine is 
broken, students question what is 
going on, seek more information 
and have discussions with peers. 
Furthermore, as an Editorial 
Board, we believe the fact that 
these protests began various 
discussions and debates about 
the issues the protests sought 
to address and whether their 
protest tactics were effective 
meant they made the issues at 
hand 
at 
least 

visible.

Protests 

are a critical 
step that goes 
beyond simply 
the 
desire 

for 
change. 

Substantial 
positive change 
requires 
more than an 
email from the 
administration 

condemning hateful actions and 
standing in solidarity with those 
affected. Emails are all well and 
good, but they can be brushed 
aside, 
archived 
and, 
quite 

frankly, ignored. Protests are 
exponentially more visible and 
powerful tools to enact change 
because they are much more 
difficult to ignore.

Human bodies and minds 

making 
observable 
calls 
to 

action can influence and inspire 
communities and individuals to 
discuss the issues and act, and it 
is our responsibility to support 
and encourage protesters in 
their work.

P

rotests in the National 
Football League took 
center stage at the end 

of September as hundreds of 
players, coaches and owners 
knelt, raised fists or linked 
arms 
during 
the 
national 

anthem in a show of solidarity. 
Though the national anthem 
protests date back to last 
year when Colin Kaepernick 
first knelt to protest racial 
injustices, 
dozens 
more 

participated this past week 
in 
response 
to 
President 

Donald Trump’s controversial 
comment 
that 
protesting 

players should be fired. 

The show of unity drew 

national news headlines and 
also elicited sharp criticism 
from many who claim that 
the protests are disrespectful 
and unpatriotic. Others have 
gone further and trivialized 
the players’ cause, calling the 
protest’s pretext of enduring 
racial biases an “ocean of lies.” 
These lines of criticism are 
unfortunate and misguided. 
While it is understandable why 
some, especially those who 
have served our country, would 
be vexed by demonstrations 
during the anthem, it is equally 
understandable why players feel 
the need to protest. Furthermore, 
the act of protesting is not 
unpatriotic; rather, it is a staple 
of American democracy.

Any analysis of the national 

anthem protests is incomplete 
without an examination of 
why the players are protesting. 
Indeed, the players’ motives 
have been a central point of 
debate in the recent days, with 
some critics claiming NFL 
players should be grateful for 
what they have. They point 
to the average NFL player’s 
salary, which at $2.1 million 
in the 2015 season, is nearly 50 
times greater than the average 
American’s salary in 2014.

This notion is shortsighted 

and minimizes the impact 
of racial injustices, many of 
which are inescapable and not 
alleviated by wealth. A 2016 
Pew Research Center survey 
found that 71 percent of U.S. 
Blacks have experienced racial 
discrimination, and roughly 
half reported that in the past 
year “someone has acted as 
if they were suspicious of 
them because of their race.” 
The wealth of the protesting 
players does not fully shield 
them from racial profiling, 

nor 
does 
it 
diminish 
the 

importance of their message.

Furthermore, 
those 

criticizing 
the 
players 
as 

“ungrateful” fail to realize 
they are advocating for the 
entire 
Black 
community, 

especially those without a 
platform to protest against the 
injustices they face. Despite 
an abundance of evidence of 
the far-reaching impacts of 
implicit racial biases, only 
36 percent of whites believe 
racial discrimination to be a 
major reason Blacks lag behind 
whites in education, income 
and more.

Considerable 
media 

attention has been devoted 
to 
police 
brutality, 
but 

discussions of racial profiling 
in policing have often devolved 
into 
a 
tedious 
game 
of 

assigning blame, rather than a 
recognition of the omnipresent 
biases 
against 
racial 

minorities. Such recognition of 
the problem is essential for any 
progress to be made; the lack 
of recognition compels these 
players to protest. Efforts to 
trivialize the motives behind 
the protests grossly devalue 
the pervasiveness of racial 
injustices in the United States 
and the significance of NFL 
players’ willingness to stand 
up to it.

However, 
other 
lines 

of 
criticism 
have 
focused 

on 
the 
methods 
of 
the 

protests. 
Detractors 
claim 

the 
demonstrations 
are 

unpatriotic or disrespectful 
to 
the 
flag. 
Admittedly, 

the 
matter 
of 
patriotism 

is 
complex 
and 
delicate. 

Kaepernick’s own comments 
on the protest, particularly his 
statement from August 2016 in 
which he explicitly declined 
to “show pride” in the flag, 
are objectively unpatriotic (at 
least denotatively) and add to 
the narrative that the protests 
dishonor the national anthem. 

While 
intended 
to 

contextualize 
his 
budding 

protest, 
Kaepernick’s 

comments 
unfortunately 

reinforced 
a 
narrow 
and 

simplistic view of patriotism. 
Patriotism is far more than 
honoring the flag; regrettably, 
when it comes to the flag, 
some seem to care more about 
the physical cloth than what 
it represents. This attitude 
toward the flag has translated 
to the outlook that patriotism 

is expressed solely through the 
veneration of the flag, when 
the true hallmark of American 
patriotism is the defense of our 
country’s democratic values. 
To truly care about the flag 
is to care about injustices, 
free 
speech 
and 
political 

expression. 
Kaepernick’s 

protest promoted this more 
refined view of patriotism 
by calling attention to the 
inadequacy of merely honoring 
the flag in its physical form.

The United States is not 

held together by a common 
race, religion or even language. 
Rather, it is our shared civic 
values of democracy, justice and 
liberty that define our national 
identity. Our nation’s robust 
civic culture demands a form 
of patriotism that honors these 
values. Genuine patriotism is 
a celebration of liberties and 
freedoms, which is why there is 
a subtle, but inherent hypocrisy 
in calling the protesting players 
unpatriotic. Patriotism requires 
a respect for protest. Protest 
is 
intrinsically 
intertwined 

with our civic values, and it is 
through protest that so many 
of the rights we take as self-
evident were secured.

Furthermore, 
there 
is 

nothing innately unpatriotic 
about the national anthem 
protests. By and large, the 
protesting players are simply 
using the stage of the national 
anthem to point out that 
this nation is still far from 
achieving many of the virtues 
the 
anthem 
symbolizes. 

One can be patriotic while 
acknowledging 
that 
our 

country is not perfect — the 
two are far from mutually 
exclusive. American society 
has many areas where progress 
is needed. Racial injustice is one.

Realizing the promises of 

equality, justice and liberty for 
all is an ongoing process, and 
neither the protests nor the 
controversy surrounding them 
are likely to go away anytime 
soon. As the NFL season 
continues, 
it 
is 
important 

to recognize the players are 
protesting for a legitimate 
cause and furthermore that 
protesting is a form of free 
speech — and there’s nothing 
unpatriotic or un-American 
about it.

Preserving patriotism

R

ecently at a concert I 
danced in a dark bar 
while cringing at the 

guy in front of me. He was in 
his 
own 
world 

and wasn’t really 
doing any harm 
— but I would 
describe 
him 

as that person, 
the person who 
decides 
that 

the 
best 
place 

to 
practice 

dramatic 
interpretive 
dance 
mixed 

with Beyoncé-esque moves is 
in a crowded concert venue. 
But besides the fact he kept 
jumping up off the floor every 
few seconds, what I remember 
most about him was his head 
wrap. 

His head wrap looked really 

nice; there was a small knotted 
ball at the top, and he put 
lavender plants inside the knot. 
But his head wrap was also out 
of place.

In the United States, head 

wraps have been a prominent 
feature in Black life and style 
for centuries. Originally the 
product of sumptuary laws 
made to shame Black women, 
head wraps became a way 
for Black women to express 
their culture and unique style. 
Slaves and other Black women 
were forced to wear rags and 
turned them into something 
rich. I never thought I would 
see a white guy in a head wrap, 
and when I did, I thought it 
was interesting.

But, at the same time, I 

could see a little glimmer of 
problematic behavior. People 

in our country, from slightly 
obnoxious 
concert-goers 
to 

Donald Trump, see no real 
issue 
in 
misrepresenting 

and 
misinterpreting 

symbols and actions.

With 
Halloween 

coming up, seeing this 
man in a head wrap left 
me in a nervous state. 
As someone who gets 
scared easily and has 
had enough of looking 
at offensive costumes 
and depictions, I am 
not 
looking 
forward 

to 
the 
upcoming 

holiday. I know some student 
organizations post guides to 
let students know if a costume 
is offensive or not, but you 
would 
think 
people 
have 

enough common sense to know 
what is appropriate and what 
counts as offensive.

I thought the head wrap 

incident was minor and hope 
people will use more creativity 
and 
fewer 
stereotypes 
to 

pick a Halloween costume, 
but 
appropriation 
and 

misrepresentation of identities 
are serious problems. When 
items of cultural significance or 
items specific to a marginalized 
group are worn because they 
look cool or because people 
think it would make a good 
Halloween costume, we forget 
what these items represent. 

But the problems different 

cultures overcame — and still 
work to overcome — are not 
just represented in physical 
objects 
like 
head 
wraps, 

but also in actions. So when 
athletes take a knee during the 
national anthem, it is not about 
the flag or for the purpose of 

disrespecting the country — it 
is to call attention to issues in 
our country.

Colin 
Kaepernick 
didn’t 

start this protest to disrespect 
the flag — he started it to bring 
attention to the murders of 
Black men and women at the 
hands of police. So why Donald 
Trump calls Kaepernick and 
every athlete who takes part in 
these peaceful protests a “son 
of a bitch” but can’t say much 
about gun-toting Nazis other 
than that they “were very fine 
people” makes no sense to me. 
He gets angry when people take 
a knee and act in a way that is 
peaceful, but when another 
group incites violence, he is 
fine with it.

Our 
identities 
sometimes 

blind us from the cultural 
significance 
of 
items 
and 

actions 
of 
other 
groups. 

Because of this I feel we should 
all take a minute to step back 
and workshop things. We don’t 
need to go over and check 
whether every single thing is 
culturally 
appropriated, 
but 

some things are not only worn 
for style or done because it’s 
cool, but because they have an 
important purpose that needs 
to be recognized. One way to do 
this is to talk to others. We can 
learn a lot by talking to people 
who aren’t exactly like us.

So before calling someone 

a “son of a bitch” or wearing 
something offensive to a concert 
or a Halloween party, maybe 
consider the implications of 
what you’re wearing or saying.

Don’t stop disrupting

I

f you found yourself at the Central Campus Transit Center, 
also known as the C.C. Little bus station, last Monday, perhaps 
you were dismayed your normal bus had been rerouted. If 

you found yourself walking through the Diag, perhaps you were 
confused by the crowds of people surrounding a man kneeling 
at the block ‘M.’ These two protests in response to recent racist 
incidents on campus intentionally disrupted the normal flow 
of everyday life at the University of Michigan. The Michigan 
Daily Editorial Board is fully supportive of these protests; they 
challenged the routine of everyday life, called attention to the 
hostile climate caused by acts of racism and made the issues at 
hand accessible to the wider campus and Ann Arbor community.

Revelry and community mark a night of good tunes and 
good drinks as Protomartyr released their latest last Friday

On a Friday night, practically 

every generation of Detroit 
punk fans were united in a sea 
of black and gray jeans, waiting 
by the dock to board the Detroit 
Princess 
Riverboat. 
There 

was a slight disconnect, given 
the more preparatory-school-
like connotation of a riverboat 
cruise. 
That 
dissonance 

evaporated when we boarded 
and the first of seven bars 
offered us a Pabst Blue Ribbon. 
It felt very right.

Protomartyr, 
Detroit’s 

preeminent punk band today, 
chose this venue to celebrate 
their fourth album, Relatives 
of Descent, a week early. The 
album was officially released on 

Friday, September 29, to much 
acclaim. They brought along 
with them five other acts in 
what was an evening long party 
for the local scene.

We caught the tail end of 

Detroit 
producer 
Matthew 

Dear’s set, a University alum 
and near legend of the techno 
world. He is currently teaching 
a music production class at 
the University. His was a loud, 
strange, noise-filled sound that 
felt hardly contained within the 

low-ceilinged room.

That was around 7:00 p.m., and 

the crowd dissipated and filtered 
through the multiple floors of 
the boat afterwards. Each floor 
was, naturally, complete with a 
bar. On the quieter third floor, 
where the merchandise was 
located, seats and tables were 
arranged in front of a screen 
showing 
“Waterworld” 
with 

Kevin Costner. Tables were 
also selling physicals of the 
new Protomartyr album. The 
cover features a stark image of a 
woman in a white head cloth in 
front of a pink background. 

We moved to the deck for some 

fresh, cigarette-filled air, and a 
DJ alternated between upbeat 
sounds and Beach House’s Teen 
Dream, which felt fitting looking 
down the river that separates 
Detroit and Canada. There was 
a calm on this level that felt odd 
for a punk show, but enjoyable 
nonetheless. Some even brought 
their 
Moleskines 
for 
some 

quality time to think.

The boat set sail shortly 

after, and Tyevk and ADULT. 
both played strong, energetic 
sets during the sail. The stage 
room didn’t truly fill until we 
docked again for the final two 
bands, and then Preoccupations 
(formerly known as Viet Cong) 
played to an enthralled crowd. 
Their 
set, 
which 
opened 

with their hit “Anxiety,” was 
characterized by improvisation 
and pure, unbridled emotion. At 
the tail end they spent over ten 
minutes slamming out the same 
final chord, each time seeming 
like the last. It was a game with 
the audience and it worked — the 
room vibrated still after. 

The climax of the evening 

was clearly Protomartyr. Part 
of their cult fandom comes from 
the sheer energy of their live 
shows. Joe Casey will, without 
fail, quite literally sweat on you 
if you’re close enough. You can 
usually see it drip down his 
forehead by track four, and he 
certainly went headfirst into 
this performance. The luckiest 
among us were spat on. They 
played through their new album 
from front to back, and added a 
few crowd pleasers in between, 
like “Cowards Starve,” dripping 
out the words “I’m going out 
in… style!” with disdain and 
immediacy. It was entrancing, 

it was angry and it was head 
banging. The mosh pit opened 
quickly and sustained a good 
tempo through the show, and it 
never became antagonistic — the 
crowd was in sync with itself, and 
with the band. When someone 
dropped their purse, everyone 
stopped and let her pick it up. 
And the boat remained afloat 
among the communal noise.

On 
a 
warmer-than-usual 

mid-September Friday, three 
friends and I drove to the 
Michigan-Canada border for 
a miniature cruise aboard the 
Detroit Princess, a riverboat 
whose existence, I must confess, 
I wasn’t even aware of until 
Detroit 
punks 
Protomartyr 

booked it for their record 
release show. After parking 
on the Cobo Center roof, we 
made our way down to the 
channel to wait with hundreds 
of others in line. The crowd 
was about what you would 
expect, an interesting mix of 
yuppie, grimy and old-timey, 
but nothing if not brimming 
with excitement. Meanwhile, 
Graeme Flegenheimer — owner 
of Detroit’s El Club, who helped 
curate the event — anxiously 
paced up and down the line, 
reminding people to have their 
IDs ready and that the boat was 
shoving off promptly at 7:15 
p.m.

Though billed as a show, the 

event was more like a festival. 
Sets started at 6:30 with special 
guest 
Matthew 
Dear 
and 

featured more-or-less local acts 
— Detroit rockers Tyvek and 
ADULT. as well as Protomartyr 
alongside 
Calgary-based 

post-punks 
Preoccupations 

and Toronto noise rock band 
METZ, whose new album also 
happened to be released the day 
of the event.

The shows were all held 

on the first floor of the boat, 
but plenty of entertainment 
could be found in just about 
every corner of the five-story 
ship. Movie screenings took 
place throughout the night 
on the second floor, with food 
and band merchandise on the 
third floor and myriad bars 
throughout the entire venue.

It 
wasn’t 
until 
we 
had 

reached the fourth and fifth 

floors, though, that I decided 
I would one day be doing 
everything in my power to have 
my wedding — let’s hope I can 
manage to get married one 
day, anyway — on the Detroit 
Princess. 
It’s 
difficult 
to 

describe precisely the feeling I 
felt when we first stepped out 
onto the fourth-floor deck. 
The temperature, oppressively 
hot and humid earlier, was a 
perfect 70 degrees, tempered 
by the river’s coolness. Four 
stories up was also just high 
enough to see at least a portion 
of Detroit’s (and Windsor’s) 
sprawl under the setting sun, 
itself a beautiful menagerie 
of oranges, yellows, purples 
and soft blue-grays. When the 
Princess started moving, it was 
hard not to feel like one of the 
luckiest people alive, and for 
only $20! (This still blows my 
mind.)

As 
the 
night 
progressed 

and the boat ran out of food — 
arguably the only hitch in the 
entire evening — a rotating set 
of DJs spun smoother, poppier 
tunes on the deck while the 
punks set fire to the first 
floor. (Not literally, of course; 
Pitchfork actually published 
a piece titled “Detroit Punks 
Charter a Riverboat. Somehow 
Nothing Gets Trashed.”) When 
Protomartyr finally took the 
stage, the crowd was no less 
energetic than it had been two 
or three hours earlier, and the 
band brought the heat to match 
— frontman Joe Casey actually 
kept a full-size bath towel 
on his mic stand, citing his 
imminent sweatiness.

The band’s set was composed 

of new material from Relatives 
in Descent — the album wasn’t 
officially released until the 
week following the show — as 
well as songs from all three of 
their previous albums. Though 
the audience’s unfamiliarity with 
the new songs threatened to kill 
momentum at times, favorites 
from Agent Intellect and Under 
Color of Official Right ensured 
success through and through. 
At the end of the night, I had 
only two remaining coherent 
thoughts: first, I cannot wait to 
have this album and second, how 
the hell does anyone still have the 
energy to go to the aftershow?

RELEASE REVIEW

ABC

‘Modern Family’ is actually still on TV
‘Modern’ remains same 
and reaches redundancy

The show keeps its typical tone, forsaes originality in its 9th season

A model of consistency.
As it enters its ninth season, 

that’s what “Modern Family” 
has become. Each episode, each 
season, is replete with quality one-
liners and self-deprecating jokes. 
Since 2010, the show has been 
nominated for — or won — the 
Primetime Emmy for Outstanding 
Comedy Series every year. That’s 
the 
sterling 
reputation 
that 

“Modern Family” has earned for 
itself, and, if the season premiere 
is any indication, the series has no 
intention of changing its formula. 
Returning to its tried-and-true 
brand of zany, yet genuine humor, 
“Modern Family”’s ninth season 
offers loyal audiences exactly what 
they have come to expect, albeit at 
the expense of originality.

Right off the bat, “Modern 

Family”’s 
premiere 
establishes 

the series’ trademark tone, with 
Manny (Rico Rodriguez, “The 
Muppets”) re-inventing himself 
yet again to avoid embarrassment. 
Only this time, he’s adopted the 
name “Manuel” as he prepares 
to ship off to college. Manny’s 
inability to fit in has long been 
a running gag on 
the show, and this 
episode does a solid 
job of extending the 
joke.

Elsewhere, 

“Modern 
Family” 

introduces 
us 
to 

Alex’s (Ariel Winter, 
“Killers”) 
new 

boyfriend, Ben (Joe 
Mande, “Parks and Recreation”). 
Ben is saddled with the unenviable 
task of trying to make the Dunphys 
and Pritchetts like him, despite 
the fact that they all want nothing 
to do with him and his crop-top 
pajamas. Throughout the episode, 
Mande excels at being just the 

right amount of annoying and self-
aware, as he agrees with Claire’s 
(Julie Bowen, “Happy Gilmore”) 
rant about how he is “a huge 
reason why I need a vacation.”

Although Mande absorbs most 

of the episode’s verbal jabs, Cam 
(Eric Stonestreet, “The Secret 

Life 
of 
Pets”) 

still 
shines 
in 

his reduced role 
as the episode’s 
punching 
bag. 

Stonestreet 
spends most of 
the episode being 
ripped apart by 
Mitchell 
(Jesse 

Tyler 
Ferguson, 

“Ice Age: Collision Course”) and 
Gloria (Sofía Vergara, “Chef”) 
for donning a frighteningly ugly 
white robe and obnoxious amount 
of sunscreen to avoid sunburn, all 
while insisting to Mitchell, “We 
have great taste.”

Cam continues to be the ideal 

CONNOR GRADY

Daily Arts Writer

foil 
for 
everyone’s 
favorite 

curmudgeon, Jay (Ed O’Neill, 
“Married with Children”). Cam’s 
unabashedly optimistic persona 
meshes perfectly with Jay’s 
constant cynicism, producing 
some of the episode’s finest 
moments. As Jay wallows in 
his sorrowful realization that 
he is an unmemorable grandpa, 
Stonestreet reminds him of the 
time he so graciously “went to 
Costco and got me that giant 
thing of almond milk,” with 
O’Neill justifying his kindness: 
“Well you like it and it doesn’t 
go bad!” The entire scene is a 
gorgeous example of the type 
of funny, yet heartfelt comedy 
that has come to define “Modern 
Family.”

Strangely absent from this 

whole comedic picture is usual 
“Modern Family” stalwart Phil 
(Ty Burrell, “The Incredible 
Hulk”), who barely receives 
any screen time in the episode 
outside of a few hilarious scenes 
with Claire. It’s an odd decision 
for the show given that Burrell 
can carry “Modern Family” with 
his perpetually neurotic style 
and that Burrell shines in his 
brief moments in the episode. 
Since Burrell is seen as one of 
the faces of the series, it seems 
reasonable to expect his role 
return to its normal size for the 
remainder of the season.

Even 
without 
Burrell’s 

typical 
zaniness 
dominating 

the episode, the episode reeks 
of the battle-tested “Modern 
Family” formula. Chiefly, this 
recipe entails a healthy dose of 
self-deprecating 
humor 
from 

Cam, laughable paranoia from 
Gloria, blissful ignorance from 
Manny and a biting sardonic 
wit from Jay. This formula has 
allowed the show to reach the 
apex of small-screen comedy, 
it also drags the series down 
in places because using it lacks 
any semblance of creativity or 
innovation in it. While “Modern 
Family”’s characters maintain 
some of television’s strongest and 
most enjoyable chemistry, the 
show’s own consistency could 
be its downfall if it continues its 
dogged dependence on formula.

DAILY FILM COLUMN

What to watch 
this October

Film Columnist Madeleine Gaudin 
tells you all about essential horror

Every 
season 
is 
horror 

season when you’re living in a 
wasteland of violence and late-
stage capitalism, but if I had 
to pick one month that most 
embodies the genre it would, 
of course, be October. Horror’s 
tricky — when it’s good, it’s 
good. But it can be difficult 
to begin when everything’s 
a remake of a remake or part 
of the “Saw” franchise. And 
that’s such a shame, because 
horror has so much capacity 
for beauty, humor 
and 
compelling 

narrative. 
If 
you 

want to be scared 
and unsettled and 
blown away, here’s 
what I recommend 
for 
the 
most 

wonderful time of 
the year.

***

The Witch
Last 
year’s 

standout 
horror 

landed itself a number 10 spot 
on Daily Art’s coveted Best of 
2016 list, and was even higher 
on my personal list. When a 
Puritan family living on the 
outskirts of a New England 
settlement begins to implode—
dead crops, missing babies—
their eldest daughter (played 
by the incredible Anya Taylor-
Joy “Split”) seems to be at the 
center. 

Robert Egger’s directorial 

debut 
is 
stunning 
and 

horrifying. Egger — who’s set 
to direct the remake of 1922 
silent classic “Nosferatu” next 
— is a production designer by 
trade, so “The Witch” has the 
kind of meticulous beauty and 

composition that usually fall by 
the wayside in horror.

Maybe I’m biased. Witches 

are the most appealing part of 
horror culture for me. I’m here 
for cauldrons and spells and 
black cats. I’m especially here 
for covens and sisterhoods and 
the part when a girl gets really 
mad and the weather gets bad. 
But “The Witch” brings the 
subgenre back to its historical 
origins and contextualizes the 
plight of a woman whose power 

transcends 
the 

limitations of Puritan 
life.

It’s 
a 
beautiful 

meditation 
on 

girlhood, family and 
dark magic. It also 
happens to have the 
single greatest jump 
scare 
of 
all 
time 

(that’s a fact). If you 
only have time — or 
the stomach — for 
one horror movie this 

month, make it “The Witch.”

“The Witch” is available to 

stream on Amazon Prime.

Texas Chainsaw Massacre
If you didn’t go back and 

watch (or hopefully rewatch) 
Tobe Hooper’s classic slasher 
film when he died in August, 
now’s your chance. This is 
probably the closest this list is 
going to get to canon or classic 
horror.

This movie is beautiful — 

absolutely stunning. It’s also 
incredibly campy, the kind of 
low budget horror that amuses 
as much as it scares.

Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Like 
“The 
Witch,” 

“Chainsaw” treats it’s monster 
— Leatherface — with an 
unexpected tenderness.

Every minute is amazing, 

but it’s worth sitting through 
even if you’re horror averse for 
the final shot. It’s poetry spun 
from what could have been 
just 
a 
dirty 

bloodbath. 
Hooper’s eye is 
unmatched and 
the 
emotional 

core of film is 
unrivaled 
in 

modern horror. 
This is master 
class 
horror. 

This is why I 
love movies.

“Texas 

Chainsaw 
Massacre” 
is 

available 
to 

stream on Amazon Prime.

It Follows
“It Follows” is just further 

proof of what I hope has 
already been made clear at this 
point: Horror can be beautiful. 
This movie does to home 
invasion narratives what “The 
Witch” and “Chainsaw” do to 
their respective subgenres. It 
reimagines what it means to be 
followed while playing within 

the rules.

A not-so-subtle metaphor 

for STIs, “It Follows” tracks a 
demonic spirit that manifests 
itself as different people, visible 
only to the person possessed, 
who follow you until they can 
reach and kill you. The only way 
to pass the demon off to someone 
else is by having sex with them.

It’s eerie and terrifying and 

a surprisingly poignant portrait 
of teen culture. Filmed in and 

around 
Detroit, 

it’s 
beautifully 

dark. This is the 
kind 
of 
horror 

that sits with you, 
crawls under your 
skin and unsettles 
you for days after 
it ends.

“It 
Follows” 

is 
available 
to 

stream on Netflix.

***

Okay, if you’re 

still looking for an 
ease-in to horror, 

the teen fare of the 90s and early 
00s is a good place to start. The 
“Scream” franchise (especially 
1 or 4) blend humor and horror, 
and “The Craft” does horror-
lite unlike any other movie out 
there.

Go forth, get scared and 

please (please, please, please) 
watch 
“Texas 
Chainsaw 

Massacre.”

Please.

FILM REVIEW

SONY PICTURES

It’s unsurprisingly disappointing
‘Flatliners’ fails completely

The remake disappoints, just like everyone thought it would

Let’s get the lie at the center of 

“Flatliners” out of the way first. 
This 2017 film, billed as a sequel, 
is just a remake of the 1990 film of 
the same name. Despite comments 
director Niels Arden Oplev (“Speed 
Walking”) has made and the casting 
of Kiefer Sutherland (“Designated 
Survivor”), who starred in the 
original, “Flatliners” does little 
more than copy the original’s story 
nearly scene for scene, occasionally 
even line for line. What little novelty 
there might have been in expanding 
the original’s ideas is almost 
completely drowned out by a story 
that seems to go out of its way to be 

a boilerplate imitation of an already 
mediocre film.

For those unfamiliar with the 

original, “Flatliners” tells the story 
of a group of medical students who 
— in a series of attempts to probe 
the afterlife — kill themselves 
temporarily 
and 

have their colleagues 
resuscitate 
them 

after 
an 
allotted 

time 
has 
passed. 

Once they’re back 
in the world of the 
living, they begin 
to 
experience 

hallucinations that 
seem to imply some part of the 
afterlife isn’t done with them yet.

Ultimately, this remake’s biggest 

problem is the same one that 

plagued the original: The central 
conceit is too good for the movie 
that follows. There is limitless 
storytelling opportunity to the idea 
of scientists proving the existence of 
an afterlife, but neither the original 
nor the remake go anywhere 

particularly special 
with it. There are 
a 
few 
nebulous 

definitions thrown 
out (“It was like 
pure 
energy,” 
“It 

was kind of sexual”) 
and an attempt to tie 
into a greater story 
about 
redemption, 

but everything about the afterlife 
and its nature and capabilities is so 
poorly defined that it’s impossible 
for any stakes to develop.

That means that when it 

comes to the horror, it’s hard to 
be all that scared because it hasn’t 
been established what audience 
members are supposed to be 
scared of. In “The Conjuring,” 
we’re scared of the Bathsheba’s 
hold over the Perron family. In 
“It,” we’re scared of Pennywise 
and the other forms It takes and 
the way it feeds off peoples’ fear. 
In “Flatliners,” we’re just scared 
of the next inevitable blast of 
loud noise. Oplev, who directed 
the excellent “Mr. Robot” pilot, 
wrangles some atmosphere into 
a few scenes, but for most of the 
runtime, the script seems to be 
actively working against him.

To the movie’s credit, it tries 

to set up characters with unique 
problems 
and 
personalities. 

There is an effort made to base 
the story around the characters’ 
struggles. 
One 
character 
in 

particular is given an interesting 
arc with a shocking ending, 
and it’s no coincidence that this 
storyline represents the biggest 
departure from the original. 
The cast does their best, and 
while results vary — Diego 
Luna (“Rogue One: A Star Wars 
Story”) suffers through some of 
the worst dialogue of the year 
— it’s hard to say that anyone is 
outright bad.

It’s not as if the original 

“Flatliners” was a great movie, 
or even a good one. It’s tediously 
slow, features effects and scares 
that have aged incredibly poorly 
and is mostly notable for its 
cast and being directed by a 
pre-“Batman and Robin” Joel 
Schumacher. Still, it’s hard not 
to be disappointed at having 
to watch this remake take the 
same ingenious idea and waste 
it in many of the same ways. A 
good cast and a few moments of 
atmosphere can’t overcome the 
slavish devotion to the source 
material without even an attempt 
at reconciling that movie’s flaws.

DIRTY HIT

Wolf Alice’s new album wows
And for once, an Alt-Indie 
rock band that isn’t sad

The latest from the band continues on what the last album started: 
unexpected yet melodious arrangements of sound and feeling 

In 2015, Wolf Alice burst 

onto the British alt-rock stage 
with their first album, My Love 
Is Cool. With tracks like “Bros” 
and “You’re a Germ,” the four-
member 
band 
effortlessly 

blended 
acoustic 
riffs 
and 

melodious 
vocals 
with 

pounding bass and grating 
yells. A delirious explosion 
of sound, My Love Is Cool is 
flighty; it jumps from speakers 
with vitality, spinning into a 
kaleidoscope of emotion and 
never lingering too long in one 
place.

Wolf Alice’s latest release, 

Visions of a Life, introduces 
nothing 
new 
but 
rather 

expands 
on 
their 
debut’s 

unpredictability. The album’s 
songs 
are 
like 
full-color 

illustrations 
of 
different 

moments in a person’s life. A 

scattered collection of photos 
faintly bound together by the 
barest glimmer of thread, what 
they lack in cohesivity, they 
make up for in expressiveness.

The 
initial 
track, 

“Heavenward,” begins in a 
hazy nebula of ambient synth; 
grey matter that transforms 

into a rhythmic instrumental 
background that rises and falls 
under the line of lead singer 
Ellie 
Rowsell’s 
voice. 
The 

echo of her vocals are almost 
lost in translation: a nearly 
indiscernible chorus of “Go 
heavenward / As all Earth’s 
angels should” unravels the 
edges of the song. Frayed and 
obscure, “Heavenward” sits at 

the edge of consciousness — a 
half-forgotten memory.

In contrast, the succeeding 

track, 
“Yuk 
Foo,” 
seems 

to come from an entirely 
different band altogether, one 
that doesn’t give a “shit, shit, 
shit.” 
Rowsell’s 
aggressive 

screams backed by a raucous 
medley of punk rock anger 
gives the middle finger to the 
modest 
“Heavenward.” 
As 

“You bore me to death, well 
deplore me / No, I don’t give a 
shit” scratches nails down the 
chalkboard of prepubescent 
angst, Visions of a Life jolts 
from one sentiment to another. 
With little to no warning, 
a 
metamorphosis 
occurs: 

whimsical 
experimentation 

into belligerent rage. 

Open up the fucking pit, 

Wolf Alice.

The last lingering clamor 

of “Yuk Foo” mellows into 
“Beautifully Unconventional,” 
and Visions of a Life takes 

another turn, this time into 
a more relaxed, slightly pop-
infused 
composition. 
The 

muted simplicity of background 
harmonies calls attention to the 
bounce in Rowsell’s delivery 
of “Hannah! She lives! She 
breathes! / She’s beautifully 
unconventional.” 
Breezy 

and unaffected, this song is 
less 
substantial 
than 
“Yuk 

Foo” but more approachable: 
superficially catchy.

The 
rest 
of 
the 
album 

continues to leapfrog in the 
same erratic manner. Breathy, 
half-finished 
speculations 

stand next to relentless tempos 
that oddly cut into the acoustic 
pluck of “After the Zero Hour:” 
Wolf Alice manages to fit a lot 
into twelve tracks.

Although the songs rarely 

falter in delivering originality, 
each arrangement distinctive 
and 
multifaceted, 
the 

discombobulated 
complexity 

can 
oftentimes 
become 

overpowering. 

The 
various 
components 

of Visions of a Life seem to 
stand 
independent 
of 
each 

other; a spilled jigsaw puzzle 
with mismatched pieces, it’s 
hard to see the overall picture 
with songs that just don’t fit 
together.

It is almost impossible to form 

the flurry of contrasting sound, 
clashing harmonies and jarring 
juxtapositions 
into 
sequences 

that are easier to follow. 

After 
all, 
in 
choosing 
to 

focus 
mostly 
on 
individual 

track 
development 
rather 

than 
establishing 
an 
overall 

coherent 
flow, 
Wolf 
Alice 

creates a labyrinth: A cacophony 
of 
disconnected 
personal 

exclamations that can be easy to 
get lost in.

But even so, this isn’t an album 

that is meant to lock neatly 
together.

Within the disarray, each song 

becomes an abstract mosaic of 
Wolf Alice’s distant memories; a 
chromatic jumble that transforms 
Visions of a Life into a poignant 
exploration of human emotion.

“Game, set, match Lommer,” 

the 
loudspeaker 
rang 
over 

a brisk Sunday afternoon in 
Evanston.

In the Blue Flight of the 

Wildcat Invitational, Michigan 
sophomore 
Chiara 
Lommer 

took home her first individual 
collegiate 
championship. 

Lommer, 
ranked 
115th 
in 

the nation coming into the 
competition, 
dominated 
all 

weekend behind her improved 
offense 
and 
aggressive 

approach, and as a result never 
dropped more than four games 
in a set.

“This weekend was a pretty 

good weekend competitively 
because I was really going out 
there every match and staying 
in the points and not giving 
away free errors, which are 
common at the beginning of the 
fall,” Lommer said. “Just trying 
to be competitive all weekend 
was my biggest goal.”

And with her stellar play, 

Lommer aced her goal. On 

Friday, Lommer cruised to a 
straight set victory against 
Utah’s Margo Pletcher. She 
followed 
up 
her 
opening 

round 
win 
with 
another 

dominant performance against 
Kentucky’s Sedi Jacobs and 
advanced into the championship 
round with a 6-3, 6-2 victory. 
In the championship match, 
Lommer 
decisively 
defeated 

Notre Dame’s Allie Miller, 6-3, 
6-4, to close out a spectacular 
weekend of play.

“(This 
summer), 
I 
really 

worked on my return and 
trying to get a lot of depth on 
it,” Lommer said. “I also really 
worked on my forehand and 
approaching the net, so just a 
lot more offense.”

Lommer’s 
improvements 

were apparent en route to her 
finals win, and they will surely 
serve her well in future contests. 

Also participating in the 

tournament for the Wolverines 
were sophomore Lera Patiuk 
and freshman Bella Lorenzini. 
To 
begin 
tournament 
play, 

Patiuk 
overwhelmed 
Notre 

Dame’s Caroline Dunleavy in 
straight sets. Unlike Lommer, 
however, Patiuk was unable to 
advance to the championship 
round in her division. She 
fell Saturday at the hands of 
Michigan State’s Aslina Chua. 
In her last match, Patiuk edged 
out a victory in the Red Flight 
third place contest over Utah’s 

Victoria Robinson, 6-1, 2-6 and 
6-3.

Lorenzini, on the other hand, 

struggled to get off on the right 
foot. In her opening match, she 
lost to Notre Dame’s Cameron 
Corse, and on Saturday, she fell 
to Michigan State’s Samantha 
Memije. Unfazed by the results 
from her first two matches, 
Lorenzini rebounded Sunday to 
defeat DePaul’s Marija Jovicic 
in three sets, 3-6, 7-6 and 7-5.

In addition to playing in 

the singles draw, Lommer and 
Lorenzini played together in 
the doubles draw.

“Doubles helps me be more 

aggressive in singles,” Lommer 
said. “It helps me stay in the 
mindset where I’m trying to 
come to the net and finish the 
point rather than staying back 
and just rallying.”

In their preliminary match, 

the duo topped Florida State’s 
Nandini 
Das 
and 
Ariana 

Rahmanparast, 6-4. Saturday, 
they dropped their match to 
host 
school 
Northwestern’s 

Inci Ogut and Julie Byrne, 6-1. 
Later in the afternoon, the 
Wolverine duo rallied to defeat 
Chicago State’s Maria Kostyuk 
and Iesha Shepherd, 6-4.

For the final doubles match 

of the weekend, Patiuk played 
in place of Lorenzini in the 
consolation 
second 
round, 

where 
she 
and 
Lommer 

overcame Utah’s Leah Heimuli 

and Briana Turley, 6-4.

“I think the individual play in 

the fall allows us to go out there 
and have less of an expectation 

to win for a team,” Lommer 
said. “We’re also able to keep 
working on stuff that we did in 
the summer without as much 

pressure as in a dual match. It 
allows us to keep getting better 
and developing our game so it is 
100% for January.”

Notebook: Wolverines talk O’Korn, Michigan State

In the final days leading up to 

Michigan State’s first appearance 
in Ann Arbor since the infamous 
botched punt, the No. 7 Michigan 
football team (1-0 Big Ten, 4-0 
overall) spoke to the media and 
discussed the rivalry, the offense 
and how fifth-year senior John 
O’Korn has adjusted as the new 
starting quarterback. 

Stay up to date with the 

Wolverines 
in 
this 
week’s 

notebook.

Gentry’s improvement at 

tight end

The tight end group stepped 

up against Purdue, with two 
players 
— 
sophomore 
Sean 

McKeon and redshirt sophomore 
Zach Gentry — combining for 130 
yards on eight total catches.

“We (the tight ends and 

O’Korn) 
have 
a 
strong 

chemistry,” 
Gentry 
said. 

“Everyday after practice we stick 
around with the quarterbacks 
and get some extra balls and run 
some extra routes for them. The 
tight ends, we’re a hardworking 
group and we’ve got a lot of guys 
who can contribute.

“... (O’Korn) was able to find 

us last game, and everything just 
worked out. We just got to hope 
he keeps hitting us a little bit.”

Gentry, a former quarterback 

who converted to tight end, 
caught his first career touchdown 
pass against the Boilermakers.

The conversion to tight end 

wasn’t easy for Gentry. He 
didn’t get much playing time 
at his new position early in his 
career, but now he’s a key player 
for Michigan’s offense and a 

favorable target for Michigan’s 
quarterbacks.

Gentry has improved most in 

pass protection and blocking, 
a part of the game that was 
completely new to him after 
switching from quarterback.

“(Blocking was) something 

that was completely foreign 
to me,” Gentry said. “I mean, 
usually, I was the guy in practice 
that you weren’t allowed to 
touch. Having to block (former 
Michigan 
defensive 
linemen) 

Taco 
Charlton 
and 
Chris 

Wormley was something else. … 
I was pretty bad at just getting 
down at pad level.”

Isaac ready for blitz-heavy 
Michigan State defense

The Spartans will be the 

toughest defensive test Michigan 
has faced yet, and if O’Korn 
struggles during his first start 
this season, then Michigan will 
have to turn to its running back 
rotation for offense.

The Spartans rank 16th in the 

nation and third in the Big Ten 
for rush defense, allowing just 96 
rushing yards per game.

“(Michigan 
State 
has) 
a 

really tough front seven,” said 
fifth-year senior running back 
Ty Isaac. “They do a lot of run 
blitzing, so we’ve definitely been 
watching on film and practicing 
those looks having had an extra 
week of preparation.”

With 
a 
trio 
of 
rushers, 

Michigan’s running backs have 
proven they might have more 
depth than any other position 
group.

Isaac leads Michigan with 89 

rushing yards per game and one 
touchdown. Trailing him are 
sophomore Chris Evans (56 yards 

per game, two touchdowns) and 
junior Karan Higdon (34 yards 
per game, two touchdowns).

Isaac, who suffered a minor 

injury against Air Force, is 
back to full strength after the 
bye week. He started against 
Cincinnati and Air Force, but 
didn’t get the start against 
Purdue.

“Hopefully we can dial some 

stuff and get the run game 
going,” Isaac said.

That may be easier said 

than done. The Spartans shut 
down Iowa’s running game last 
weekend, holding the Hawkeyes 
to just 19 yards on the ground.

Onwenu familiar with 

Spartans’ defensive line

Sophomore 
right 
tackle 

Michael 
Onwenu, 
a 
Detroit 

native, has plenty of connections 
to Michigan State. His sister, 
Stephanie, and one of his cousins 
both attend Michigan State. But 
outside of the family, he knows 
plenty of players on the Spartans’ 
roster.

“That D-line, I probably went 

to camps with the majority of 
them, especially the interior 
guys,” Onwenu said. “So I know 
how they play. It’s gonna be a 
game to watch.”

While he was in high school, 

he didn’t play directly against any 
future Michigan State defensive 
linemen, but he went head to 
head with them in summer 
football camps. They played with 
less contact in camps, but he 
became familiar with how some 
of them like to pass rush.

He also watched Michigan 

State beat Iowa this weekend 
to get a better idea of how the 
Spartans like to line up on 
defense.

Michigan State has tallied just 

nine sacks this season — half the 
amount that Michigan has — but 
Onwenu and the Wolverines’ 
offensive line will be challenged 
nonetheless.

The Spartans will challenge 

the 
young 
right 
side 
of 

Michigan’s offensive line. It 
features Onwenu inside at right 
guard and a mix of redshirt 
sophomores Jon Runyan Jr. and 
Nolan Ulizio at right tackle. 
Those guys will have to step up 
as the Wolverines move into the 
thick of their Big Ten schedule.

Onwenu appears up to the 

task. This week, he’s not been 
in contact with any of his 
counterparts at Michigan State. 
He’s focusing solely on getting 
ready for the rivalry game.

“They might be avoiding me,” 

he said. “They don’t want to get 
hit.”

Michigan sets new volleyball 
attendance record at Crisler

With 
8,137 
spectators 
in 

attendance, the No. 23 Michigan 
volleyball team drew its largest 
crowd in team history as it took 
down 
rival 

Ohio 
State, 

3-1, at Crisler 
Center 
on 

Friday night. 

The 

Wolverines 
more 
than 

tripled 
their 

previous 
record 
attendance 
of 2,673 from 
2009 and more than quadrupled 
the maximum attendance in 
their normal arena — the 1,800 
seat capacity Cliff Keen Arena. 

This was Michigan’s first 

and only match to be played at 
Crisler Center this season and 
its first regular season match 
played there since a 3-1 defeat 
against 
Nebraska 
in 
2015. 

Last season, the Wolverines 
hosted two NCAA Tournament 
matches there against American 
University and Oregon, both 
victories for the Wolverines.

Senior middle blocker Claire 

Kieffer-Wright 
remembers 

those 
games 
well. 
She 

appreciated the atmosphere the 
fans created then, even though 
it paled in comparison to Friday 
night.

“The last time we played (at 

Crisler) we had the first round 
and the second round of the 
NCAA Tournament,” Kieffer-
Wright said. “I felt like the vibe 
was going [then], but tonight 
was just an extra step up.” 

For 
those 
8,137 
fans 
in 

attendance — in addition to the 
15 Michigan volleyball players 
— it was clear that Friday’s 
match was going to be a special 
one from the moment of the first 
serve. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
student 

section was filled to the point 
that 
students 
had 
to 
find 

seating elsewhere. They were 
seen 
sprinkled 
across 
the 

upper section of the arena, still 
vigorously cheering along and 
enjoying the match. 

While the fans were very 

enthusiastic during the course 

of 
the 
entire 

match, 
the 

mayhem 
reached 

its pinnacle in the 
fourth and final 
set. 

Michigan 

was 
down 
17-11 

and went on a 
6-0 
run 
to 
tie 

the set. At that 
point, for every 
subsequent point 

the Wolverines scored, the fans 
went wild until the victory-
clinching point. The entire 
arena erupted in a collective 
cheer of approval louder than 
any other moment during the 
match.

During the Wolverines’ final 

run, players were also getting in 
on the fun as they were shown 
dancing on the big screen 
during breaks in play.

Kieffer-Wright, who was too 

focused on the match to get 
caught up in 
the 
dancing, 

thought 
that 
the 

environment 
pushed 
the 

players to win 
the match.

“It 
(made) 

the hairs on 
the 
back 
of 

my neck stand 
up,” 
Kieffer-

Wright said. “You just feel good 
and feel like comfortable and 
like, ‘OK, they’re ready for this 
next point and they’re ready to 
see us win.’ It’s just incredible. 
I love it.”

Kieffer-Wright 
led 
the 

Wolverines to victory after 
recording 
team 
highs 
in 

points, hitting percentage and 
blocks, with 19, .375 and nine, 
respectively.

Michigan coach Mark Rosen 

also noticed the impact of the 
crowd. The energy the fans 
brought was unlike any other 
home match Rosen had ever 
experienced during his time at 
the helm of the program.

While he loved the overall 

support 
of 
the 
fans, 
he 

specifically loved the student 
support 
and 
wants 
to 
see 

more matches with this type 
of turnout. In order to make 
that vision a reality, however, 
Michigan will first need to 
catch up with the rest of the Big 
Ten in terms of its volleyball 
arena size. 

“We see this [crowd size] 

all 
the 
time,” 
Rosen 
said. 

“Michigan State has that kind 
of 
crowd, 
not 
consistently, 

but they’ve had that before. 
Nebraska has it, Minnesota has 
it, so in our conference we play 
in front of that all the time.”

The team sold out Cliff Keen 

Arena for about half of its 16 
home matches last season, and 
Rosen believes that the team 
is easily capable of generating 
an attendance well above Cliff 
Keen Arena’s maximum, as 
shown by the turnout for the 

Ohio State match.

“There is work 

being done behind 
the scenes to try to 
get us into a bigger 
place,” Rosen said. 
“Hopefully 
we 

can keep pushing 
the agenda to get 
that done because 
we’ve 
outgrown 

Keen. There’s no 
question about it.”

For 
now, 
though, 
the 

Wolverines will take what they 
can get in terms of attendance 
and appreciate the amazing 
turnout they received for one 
match. 

“It’s a feeling you’ll never 

be able to replicate,” Kieffer-
Wright said. “A rivalry, just a 
great home crowd. …It just feels 
good to have the support of Ann 
Arbor and Michigan students.” 

It (made) the 
hairs on the 

back of my neck 

stand up.

It just feels 
good to have 
the support of 

Ann Arbor.

VOLLEYBALL

Marody eager for first full season on the ice

Fifty-three seconds into the 

third period Saturday night, 
Cooper Marody paused, just 
momentarily, after receiving 
a beautiful setup from junior 
defenseman Joseph Cecconi. 
Within seconds, he knocked 
a one-timer into the bottom 
right corner of the net, beyond 
the outstretched reach of the 
Western Ontario goaltender. 

The junior forward’s textbook 

goal — which came during 
the Michigan hockey team’s 
season-opening exhibition — is 
simply a microcosm of his style 
of play. His patience and ability 
to drown out surrounding noise 
while on the rink is a special 
characteristic of his game that 
many players find difficult to 
master.

And his new head coach, Mel 

Pearson, was quick to note that 
Marody’s style of play stands 
out.

“He’s so patient,” Pearson 

said. “He’s so smart with the 
puck, and he sees things that 
maybe even a person sitting 
in the stands wouldn’t see, let 
alone a person on the ice with 
all the commotion going on. 
He has a way of just slowing 
the game down, even when 
everything’s going crazy.”

Marody’s offensive prowess 

in the game extended beyond 
his goal, as well. He registered 
an 
assist 
in 
each 
period, 

characteristic of a seasoned 
forward who knows how to 
crisply set the puck up for his 
teammates in a way that is 
almost second nature.

As 
a 
veteran 
Wolverine, 

entering his third year on 
the team, it makes sense that 
Marody has the innate capacity 
to create these opportunities 
on the ice. There is something 
glaring, 
however, 
that 
sets 

Marody 
apart 
from 
his 

upperclassmen 
counterparts: 

he has yet to play a full 
collegiate season. And last year 
was the most extreme case of 
that, as his sophomore season 
was slashed in half.

It’s safe to 

say 
Marody 

didn’t 
expect 

his 
career 
at 

Michigan 
to 

take the course 
it did.

In the midst 

of 
his 
elite 

freshman 
campaign 
— 

when he netted 
24 points and 
played 
in 
32 

games — Marody fell ill with 
mononucleosis in mid-January, 
taking him off the ice for an 
entire month.

Though he was able to finish 

out his first season once healthy 
again, 
the 
illness 
resulted 

in a serious ramification for 
his sophomore year: he was 

academically 
ineligible 
to 

play 
for 
the 

Wolverines 
during 
the 
fall 

semester.

While Marody 

still 
practiced 

every day with 
the 
team, 
the 

time away from 
the sport he loved 
was painful. 

“Any 
time 
a 

sport you love gets taken away 
from you and you can’t play, if 
you’re a competitor you feel 
it,” Pearson said. “And I think 

(Cooper) felt it. I think it was 
tough on him last year. Now, 
he’s reenergized and he knows 
if he continues to do the things 
that he needs to do that he’s 
going to play and 
play all year, and 
be a big part of 
our team.”

Added Cecconi: 

“I’ve known Coop 
since before I got 
to school, and it 
definitely 
hurt 

him 
a 
bit 
not 

being able to play 
the first half of 
the season,” he 
said. “The first 
couple games of the season are 
times to adjust and get back 
into hockey. And for him not 
to have that was kind of a blow 

to our team and himself, but he 
came back strong.”

And 
come 
back 
he 
did. 

Starting with the Great Lakes 
Invitational on Dec. 29-30, 

Marody played 
out the final 
18 
games 
of 

his sophomore 
season. 
He 

notched 
15 

points through 
the end of the 
year, en route 
to being one of 
the 
standouts 

in an otherwise 
relatively 
lifeless 

Michigan offense.

Marody’s hat trick in the 

Wolverines’ 5-4 victory over 
Ohio State on Feb. 3 epitomized 

his resurgence. It was the 
most goals anyone on the team 
scored in a game last season.

Reflecting back on last year’s 

adversities, Marody couldn’t 
be more ready to move on and 
begin what he hopes to be his 
first complete season on the 
Wolverine roster. And a goal 
paired with three assists in the 
exhibition game is certainly not 
a lousy way to start.

“It 
was 
an 
unfortunate 

situation, but it’s over now,” 
Marody said. “I’ve learned a lot 
of valuable things from it, and 
I’m just looking to move forward 
from that. It’s obviously tough, 
but if you learn from it, and 
move forward. You’re a better 
person because of it.

“Hopefully, I’ll stay healthy 

the whole season. It will be 
my first full season here at 
Michigan, so I’m very excited 
about that. It will be good 
to continue to develop that 
chemistry with my linemates, 
and I’m just very, very excited 
to play a whole season.”

Marody 
had 
no 
way 
of 

foreseeing 
the 
path 
his 

collegiate hockey career was 
going to take, and without a 
doubt would have preferred for 
his sophomore year to take on a 
different narrative.

That being said, Marody’s 

rare circumstance allowed him 
to gain perspective — not just 
on this season, but for the rest 
of his life as well. 

“(I now know) that it could 

always be worse,” Marody said. 
“Like if you have a bad day at 
practice, you’re just lucky that 
you’re healthy and able to play. 
So if you don’t have a good day, 
if you don’t have a good shift, if 
you don’t have a good game, you 
can just be thankful that you’re 
playing and healthy. And then 
nothing else that’s wrong is 
that big of a deal. So to just keep 
that positive mindset, every day 
coming to the rink, no matter 
what happens.”

sexual 

orientation or most any other 
identity — has been assigned 
to the realm of liberalism, 
generally speaking. But when 
liberals have called for a wider 
definition of “hate speech,” 
people 
have 
accusedthem 

of intolerance. This idea of 
“tolerance” is connected to 
the idea of empathy. Liberals 
call for empathizing with 
marginalized groups — and 
therefore tolerating them — but 
when it comes to conservatives 
they make no such calls to 
action.

In the media, this issue 

of 
liberal 
(in)tolerance 
of 

conservatives 
isn’t 
new, 

but I believe the intensity 
of the problem has been 
underemphasized. The conflict 
between the call for more 
empathy and tolerance toward 
others, on the one hand, and the 
call for more restricted speech, 
on the other hand, exists on a 
philosophical level — it has to 
do with beauty and justice, two 
values that are most important 
to society.

Empathy 
has, 
from 
the 

beginning, been tied to the 
realm of aesthetics, the field of 
philosophy concerned with the 
appreciation of art, beauty and 
good taste. According to the 
Oxford English Dictionary, the 
term first appears in English 
in the work of Vernon Lee 
and Clementina Anstruther-
Thomson, two prominent late-
19th-century 
scholar-artists 

who lived together openly as 
lovers, friends and co-authors. 

In their most prominent book, 
“Beauty and Ugliness: And 
Other Studies in Psychological 
Aesthetics,” 
they 
define 

empathy 
as 
an 
“aesthetic 

sympathetic feeling.”

The emergence of empathy 

in the English lexicon during 
the early 1900s, in Western 
Europe, coincides with the 
rise of modernity and the first 
artworks famous for their 

ugliness. A great example is 
Marcel 
Duchamp’s 
statue 

“Fountain” (1917), which is 
literally a urinal signed with a 
pseudonym.

The viewer of a work of 

art can empathize with the 
artwork and find it beautiful 
— or empathize with a work 
of art and find it ugly. Theodor 
Lipps, one of the most famous 
scholars on empathy, calls the 
former “positive empathy” and 
the latter “negative empathy.”

While 
I 
can 
empathize 

with a work of art and find 
it ugly beautiful (or however 
else a work of art could be 
described), I argue that the 
work of empathizing is in itself 
beautiful. What do I mean by 
beautiful? Well, I don’t really 
know. It’s almost impossible to 

define as a word, as described 
in its really long entry in the 
Stanford 
Encyclopedia. 
I 

like to define the beautiful 
as something that “makes 
sense,” or speaks to some 
truth. Whether the thing the 
empathizer is trying to feel 
into is beautiful or ugly, the 
empathizer is still making 
sense of something.

But I can only empathize 

with 
someone if 
that person 
expresses 
him 
or 

herself 
outwardly. 
Once I can 
empathize 
with 
someone 
else’s 
emotions, 
I 
can 

determine 

whether those emotions are 
ugly or beautiful. Prominent 
art critic Arthur Danto claims 
an ugly work of art can still 
be artistically right, in that 
the work’s ugliness allows 
it to successfully convey the 
artist’s 
intended 
message. 

In the context of human 
emotion, I could empathize 
with someone and determine 
whether their ugly or beautiful 
emotions are valid.

Take, 
for 
example, 
the 

white supremacists and neo-
Nazis who protested this 
August in Charlottesville, Va. 
I can empathize with these 
people’s emotions. By this, I 
mean I can understand what 
it feels like to be angry or 
feel disenfranchised. I, by 
no means, am endorsing or 

condoning their actions, but 
the principles of empathy 
allow 
me 
to 
understand 

their 
emotions 
according 

to how they’re expressed. 
Simultaneously, I can reach 
my own conclusion that their 
intentions and actions are 
morally wrong and are an 
impediment to the furthering 
of equality and justice in this 
country.

I can empathize in the 

same way with Dana Greene, 
who last week knelt in the 
Diag for nearly 24 hours in 
protest of anti-Black racism, 
going 
through 
the 
same 

emotional and moral process. 
To make myself clear, I want to 
emphasize that the actions on 
the part of white supremacist 
and neo-Nazi protesters are in 
no way equivalent to Greene’s 
— the former incited violence 
and advocated hate, and the 
latter advocated for justice 
and peace. The process of 
empathizing allows me to 
recognize Greene’s emotions 
as valid because of the life 
experiences that led to them, 
and then reach my own 
conclusion that his actions 
and intentions are morally 
justifiable and align with 
my own vision of furthering 
equality.

If empathy is in itself 

beautiful 
and 
beauty 

furthers justice in the world 
(as I postulated in my first 
column), then I could say 
empathizing is a morally 
right thing to do. But in 
order to empathize, I must 
have someone to empathize 
with, which requires free 
expression.

Here, 
we 
reach 
the 

entanglement of empathy, 
beauty, justice and the right 
to free speech. Empathy 
requires 
individuals 
to 

express themselves, whether 
in the form of creating 
works of art, writing op-eds, 
protesting or engaging in 
other expressive activities. 
And empathy also requires 
people 
to 
receive 
the 

emotions of others, putting 
it at odds with calls for safe 
spaces, specifically on college 
campuses. When individual 
expression 
fits 
a 
given 

definition of “hate speech,” 
that 
expression 
becomes 

morally indefensible, unjust, 
etc.

The liberal call for more 

empathy seems to be at odds 
with calls for restrictions 
on hate speech and more 
safe spaces. What kind of 
expression 
is 
defensible? 

And who can be expected 
to “receive” the emotions of 
others? If we restrict certain 
forms of expression, are 
we limiting our ability to 
empathize with others?

To me, the answer is yes. I 

suppose the greater question 
is: What’s more just — allowing 
individuals to continue writing 
anti-Islam messages on the 
Diag, or restricting that kind 
of expression and approaching 
the problem of, in this case, 
Islamophobia, from a different 
angle — say, through more 
inclusive messages and greater 
cultural 
awareness 
being 

taught in public schools? While, 
logically speaking, restricting 
expression limits empathetic 
possibilities, it may be a 
necessary 
compromise 
to 

achieve a more just society.

Soundtracking: Tailgate season

I 

woke up Saturday morning not to the sound 
of birds chirping outside my window, not 
to the smell of pancakes and eggs wafting 

into my bedroom from the kitchen, but instead to 
the muffled sound of a shotgun race and ’07 Yeezy 
playing down the street.

“Good Morning” — Kanye West
Game Day: an autumn event at Michigan in which 

we can all come together and choose to forget every 
lesson we learned from Will Smith’s “Concussion” 
(2015). A day when students get to the 
Big House 30 minutes early, a stark 
contrast to being 20 minutes late to 
lecture. A day where fans can set aside 
their differences and fight with out-of-
towners about the physical aptitude of 
college students.

When I was woken up by the 

mastermind behind the line “You left 
your fridge open, somebody just took a 
sandwich,” I wasn’t annoyed with the 
frat house’s PA systems on full volume 
at nine in the morning. I was overjoyed.

Even though I was never really into 

football growing up, my cousin made 
me play catch with him a lot. He used 
to throw me perfect spirals, hurting 
either my hands or my stomach as I 
let the hard leather smack my body. 
Because of this constant barrage of 
football growing up, it’s probably the one 
sport I can both understand and enjoy. 
But before the game, the tails have to be 
gated, or whatever that means.

I threw off my sheets, realizing it 

was already 9 and the game started at 
noon and ran to the bathroom, with 
my toothbrush in one hand and paste in the other. 
Playing music from my phone, I was more than ready 
to get sunburned and vibe to early 2000s throwbacks 
at some frat on Central Campus. But first, I couldn’t 
head out completely sober. I wasn’t a madman.

Looking in my fridge, all I had was gin and some 

Diet Coke from the week before. Welp. Life works in 
mysterious ways sometimes. The shot went down 
the hatch with the Diet Coke chase close behind. 
My gut wrenched. Was that a rum and Coke chaser?

“Mistakes” — Lake Street Dive
“Look at what mistake I’m making now …”
With that mess behind me, I threw on every 

yellow piece of clothing I owned. Yellow corduroy 
shorts I bought pre-cut from Value World? Check. 
Yellow checkered shirt that looks as if it belongs 
in the rejects pile from the “Saved By The Bell” 
costume room? Check. Yellow socks that cut off 
circulation to my feet from shrinking in the wash? 
Definitely check.

Walking gingerly to the kitchen because I could 

feel my toes already going numb, I toasted a bagel 
and chowed down as I headed toward the door. 
As I laced up my sneakers, which are falling apart 
at the seams just as I will be around the middle 
of November, I remembered to grab a bucket hat 
and sunglasses. The sun is your worst enemy on 

Saturdays.

I stopped and looked at my outfit in the full-

body mirror. What I saw looking back at me was 
the equivalent of a highlighter from the ’90s, and I 
could not have felt classier. I left the house.

“Dapper” — Domo Genesis feat. Anderson .Paak
The bump and rhythm of Domo guided me down 

the street. I couldn’t help but dance and bop on my 
way to meet some friends. Who cares what you look 
like? Sometimes you’ve just gotta dance. Everyone 

was probably too drunk to care or judge by that 
point.

Tailgates are like the radio edits of frat parties. 

There’s less making out, less puking and more 
bouncy houses. But the main elements stay the 
same. Brothers spray beer everywhere, much to the 
dismay of almost everyone around them. Elevated 
surfaces and Solo Cups are strewn about on front 
lawns. The sight was familiar.

As I looked ahead, I saw the biggest smiles on a 

lawn packed full of guys and girls ready to seize the 
day — and drink away their papers due Monday.

“Sea of Love” — Phil Phillips
While the blue tarp in front of the frat started to 

collapse, exposing the sea of fans to the world, the cars 
driving by got a glimpse into the microcosm that is a 
tailgate. You have different types of tailgaters like you 
have different species of fish.

As the Naked Brothers Band said, there’s “so many 

fish in the sea.”

At any given party, you’ll most likely see brothers, 

PGP sorority members, parents reliving the glory days, 
slapping wine bags and chugging beers while the rest 
egg them on.

Walking past the many frats while on my 

gameday adventure, the music guided me. Every 
house plays the same music, but when you keep 

walking by, a playlist forms. As I walked, I heard 
Soulja Boy followed by Fountains of Wayne and Lil 
Boat with a few EDM tracks sprinkled in here and 
there. Ann Arbor truly is a mixtape on Saturdays, 
and we’re all here to dance along.

“Land of 1000 Dances” — Wilson Pickett
If I’m gonna move my feet, I’d rather be dancing 

than going for a run.

Your body needs to move when a beat comes in. 

You tap your foot. Your heart matches a tempo. The 

only time I don’t feel in control 
of my motions is when I want to 
dance.

I saw the same thing at the 

tailgates that day. Everyone was 
screaming lyrics and jumping 
and sweating every bit of alcohol 
out of their bodies. It’s the dudes 
who 
weren’t 
dancing 
who 

made me nervous. How were 
they going to get sober without 
working off the buzz?

That’s their secret. They’re 

fixin’ to die at this point.

“Fixin’ To Die Blues” — 

Bukka White

“I’m lookin’ funny in my eyes 

and I believe I’m fixin’ to die ...”

Two-liters of orange pop in 

their left hands. Half-gallons 
of Kamchatka in their right 
hands. I had never seen people 
who symbolize and personify 
the “Carrot or Stick” until that 
moment. I couldn’t look away, 
but I needed reprieve, like when 
you peek out from behind your 

hands at a horror movie. It hurt to watch. It made 
me feel like how I did that morning right after the 
infamous gin-and-rum incident. If the music is 
what drives the entire tailgate, why put your body 
in danger like that? There’s a line and I still don’t 
think some have found it yet.

I found my friends, joined a crowd, and headed 

down State toward the Big House. As we collectively 
took a left down Division, I saw a man drumming 
on a plastic bucket. As fans passed by, I saw their 
heads bob and feet move with a little more pep and 
rhythm than usual.

We were back in the midst of sound and we 

walked to the beat.

“Dancing in the Street” — David Bowie and Mick 

Jagger

Passing pizza stands and guys selling water out of 

coolers and that preacher yelling at football fans about 
the deadly dangers of homosexuality, we marched on to 
the stadium. While most of us were probably starving 
since we did not properly carb up for a morning, we 
soldiered on, pulling ourselves up by our mud-soaked 
bootstraps.

I looked out over the student section at Michigan 

Stadium. One whole year at UMich already gone, I 
knew where I was. I knew where we all were.

“Anybody have a problem with that?”

Leading a fraternity as a gay man

b y Av i S h o l k o f f, Daily Sports Writer

Public Policy junior Daniel Greene 

remembers one of the first fraternity 
rush events he attended as a freshman.

“I walk into the house, and the first 

thing I hear, is ‘that’s so gay,’” Greene 
said. “Some brother is repeating ‘that’s 
so gay.’ That’s literally the first thing 
after I checked in I heard.”

The phrase was thrown around so 

many times Greene was convinced 
someone in the fraternity spread word 
of his sexuality.

“So I thought, ‘OK, maybe not the 

house for me,’” he recalled.

Greene went to a few more fraternity 

rush events before finding his place at a 
house on the corner of Washtenaw Ave-
nue and Hill Street: Lambda Chi Alpha.

“I told them during one of the first 

two rush events, ‘Hey, I know this has 
nothing to do with anything, I don’t 
know whether you’re going to give me 
a bid, but I just wanted to let you know 
that I’m openly gay.’”

Then LSA junior CJ Motley, who 

was in charge of Lambda Chi Alpha’s 

recruitment in the fall of 2015, said his 
personal reaction to Daniel’s announce-
ment was shame.

“That he would have to think that 

would have to be an issue or a problem, 
it was kind of disheartening.”

He recalls that Greene seemed imme-

diately like a great fit for the fraternity 
after meeting him at a mass meeting.

“I felt good that he could get along 

with us, be comfortable being around 
us, but at the same time, I didn’t like the 
idea that he felt like he wouldn’t fit in 
because of who he is.”

As a freshman, Greene never could 

have imagined himself in a fraternity, 
much less a president of Lambda Chi 
Alpha. When he was in middle school, 
he never thought he’d be able to get 
married or have children. He expected 
to live a “different” life because of his 
sexual orientation.

Thankfully, Greene’s right to marry 

is no longer up for discussion after the 
June 2015Obergfell v. Hodges Supreme 
Court ruling legalized same-sex mar-

riage in the United States. And yet, 
serving as the president of a fraterni-
ty, Greene continues to face prejudice 
because of his sexuality.

***
Historically, the Michigan Greek life 

community has attempted inclusiv-
ity of LGBTQ members, but the reality 
is often murky. A 2005 “Statement for 
Human Dignity” — signed by the all 
the major Greek life organizations — 
affirmed the houses would “not toler-
ate discrimination of any kind” against 
LGBTQ members, among other margin-
alized groups on campus. Yet in October 
2016, LSA senior Emily Kaufman — who 
is a transgender-female — drew national 
attention after she dropped out of soror-
ity rush after perceived exclusion. 

Back in 2010, a Daily article found 

many LGBTQ fraternity members were 
wary of coming out to their brothers due 
to perceived social stigmas. Four frater-
nity brothers who went on the record to 
talk about their experiences as gay men 
in Greek life preferred to remain anon-

ymous because they never came out to 
many, if not all, of their fraternity broth-
ers.

“I think at the group level, kind of a 

pack mentality (exists),” one anonymous 
fraternity member told the Daily in 
2010. “Whenever someone starts jerk-
ing around and saying (homophobic) 
things, but not necessarily meant to be 
derogatory, that kind of feeds into those 
perceptions.” 

Seven years after this article was pub-

lished, Greene ascended to the leader-
ship of an IFC fraternity as an outwardly 
gay member, reflective of a societal shift 
toward acceptance of homosexuality. 
In 2006, Pew found that 54 percent of 
Americans opposed gay marriage, with 
only 37 percent in favor. Nine years 
later, the Supreme Court would codify 
a right to same-sex marriage, and that 
figure flipped by 2017, with 62 percent 
of Americans in favor of same-sex mar-
riage and 32 percent opposed.

***
Greene is busy on campus. A self-

described nerd, he’s an LSA student 
representative in Central Student Gov-
ernment as well as a peer group leader 
within the Wolverine Support Network, 
a student-led organization that pro-
motes mental health.

In grade school, Daniel tried to 

hide who he was. Some of his fellow 
elementary and middle school peers 
would ask if he was gay, and he would 
always respond with a no. It wasn’t 
until November of the sixth grade that 
he finally answered yes. Within a day, 
everyone at school knew. And Greene 
feels especially privileged that, in his 
words, his school was “super accepting.”

However, Greene couldn’t say that 

all members of his community accepted 
who he was. That year, he tried joining 
the football team as a way to fit in. The 
coach at the time asked, “What are you 
a fucking girl?” in response to Greene’s 
high-pitched voice. 

***
“I think that there are instances 

where [Greek life is homophobic]. 
There’s always room for improvement, 
but I think it’s trending in the right 
direction,” Greene said. “I think that 
the critics are legitimate, but as a whole 
— from my experience — it’s been a great 
time; a learning experience for myself 
and for fraternities.”

After he was elected president of 

Lambda Chi Alpha in December 2016, 
some members in his pledge class — as 
well as others from the pledge class that 
followed — were uneasy about a gay man 
at the helm of their fraternity solely 
because of his sexuality.

While the supermajority of his broth-

ers affirmed his election, some were 
expressly opposed.

“There are people who, if it were left 

to them, they would ensure there was no 
openly gay brother again,” Greene said, 
emphasizing that this conflict took place 
in a house he felt mostly accepted in.

At the same time, though, Greene was 

met with acceptance among members of 
fraternities at which he never expected 
to find inclusivity. He’s made friends 
with members of all different houses.

As president, Greene had to confront 

misconceptions about members of the 
LGBTQ community in Greek life, tack-
ling it through two lenses: as an openly 
gay man and as the leader of a fraternity. 

“For someone who is openly gay, you 

have to show that it’s normal,” Greene 
said. “And you can still be as functional 
and great as a fraternity and foster the 
brotherhood and social life and ideals as 
other houses, but I have to come at it from 
a weird dynamic. I have my own feelings 
and views as an openly gay man, and I 
also have separate objectives and obliga-
tions as president. You learn if you ignore 
them, people start to realize the stereo-
types are wrong, but it’s different when 
you’re the president.”

In other words, Greene doesn’t nor-

mally take a proactive approach to com-
batting anti-LGBTQ stereotypes, but as 
president of Lambda Chi Alpha, he real-
ized he had to.

Confronting stereotypes is nothing 

new to Greene. Until 10th grade, when 
he’d answer his home phone, callers 
often assumed his mother was on the 
other side. Some people would comment 
on his hand gestures and articulation of 
words. Rather than calling out each of 
these commenters, Greene has an alter-
native approach that has resonated and 
allowed him to succeed.

“It’s the willingness to not budge 

or show fear or show embarrassment 
or show vulnerability to stereotypes,” 
Greene said. “In the long term that’s 
going to help those people realize that 
(the stereotypes) are not only wrong, but 
that their perceptions are just off.”

Sometimes, though, Greene feels he 

needs to alter his personality to fit in 
with a particular group, such as the 
board of Interfraternity Council presi-
dents, where Greene felt he “stuck out” 
among the other members. He discussed 
how certain individuals in attendance 
responded 
consciously 
and 
subcon-

sciously to his being gay. 

“When you’ve been openly gay for 10 

years, you can spot someone not liking 
your personality and someone not giving 
you the time of the day because of that 
… there are subtle differences,” Greene 

said. “Do I think that IFC is homophobic? 
No. Still, I think that there are people 
in that room who wouldn’t befriend me, 
or steer clear of me if they could, just 
because I’m gay.”

For example, Greene said some peo-

ple would move their name placards to 
avoid sitting next to him. Others would 
make subtle jokes behind his back about 
his sexuality they didn’t think he would 
overhear. 

In several written statements to the 

Daily, LSA senior Joey Insalaco, IFC pres-
ident, said the council is working closely 
with the University of Michigan’s Spec-
trum Center to collaborate on additional 
support programs for LGBTQ Greek life 
members in the future. Insalaco did not 
want to elaborate until the details are 
finalized, but he emphasized there will 
be some fraternity- and sorority-specific 
support for members of the IFC and Pan-
hellenic communities, respectively.

Insalaco worked with Greene through-

out his tenure and described him as self-
lessly dedicated to his chapter, earning 
him Chapter President of the Year at the 
Go Greek Awards at the end of this past 
semester.

Engineering junior Trevor Gullstad 

had never come out to anyone before col-
lege. In high school, he attended dances 
with girls, taking them solely as friends. 
It really wasn’t until he met Daniel that 
he opened up about identity.

He never envisioned bringing anoth-

er man to one of his date parties during 
freshman year, and even had doubts he 
would do it all throughout college.

To his surprise, though, his Delta Chi 

fraternity brothers supported him when 
he told them he would be bringing Daniel 
to one of his first date parties freshman 
year.

“I said I was going to bring my boy-

friend to our date party,” Gullstad said. 
“And a senior brother said, ‘Anybody have 
a problem with that?’ And everybody said 
no, and that was that.”

“That was a big emotional release at 

that time. I was definitely glad that I got 
to tell everyone that I was bringing a boy 
to the party before so he didn’t have to 
deal with people suddenly wondering 
once he was there. (I wanted) to make 
them aware of the full context.”

Greene said the experience was simi-

larly positive. Greene also brought Gull-
stad to Lambda’s date party. He believes 
it is extremely important for gay couples 
to attend these parties to show their vis-
ibility and maintain a presence.

“I wanted a place where I could bring 

home a guy, or bring home a boyfriend or 
a male to a date party,” Greene said. “Not 
only could I do it, but I wouldn’t have to 
think of the implications of doing it. I’m 
pretty sure, that I was — even though I 
felt comfortable — the first guy to bring 
another guy to a date party in recent 
Lambda history.

“I can genuinely say that almost all my 

fraternity — if someone did something 
shitty to me, or somebody did something 
homophobic — they would not hesitate in 
standing up for me,” Greene said. “And 
not ‘because I’m a liberal so I must do 
this’ urge, but because they genuinely 
care for my well-being.”

Still, while the overwhelming major-

ity welcomed Greene and Gullstad, there 
were some sneers.

“There were definitely some people 

who were taking pictures of us, Snap-
chatting in a negative way. You could see 
them from across the room,” Greene said.

Gullstad described himself as “the per-

son to freak out going into social situa-
tions” in an email to the Daily. He greatly 
admired Greene’s tremendous confidence 
during their dates and “put himself on 
the line again and again,” to advocate for 
people to express their true identities.

“(He taught me) about being visible 

and being super open, showing me that 
you could be out and proud and have lots 
of friends who were interested in differ-
ent activities and different types of peo-
ple and not have it negatively impact your 
life,” Gullstad said.

***
As a freshman, Greene only entered 

the IFC fraternity rush process because 
he wanted to experience every opportu-
nity offered on campus. Some friends in 
South Quad Residence Hall went to the 
meetings, and he chose to tag along. Two 

years later, he is a proud past president of 
Lambda Chi Alpha.

Grateful for his experience, he still 

wonders how different his college expe-
rience would’ve been had he entered 
college five or six years ago when the 
national and campus climate was less 
accepting of the LGBTQ community.

Greene was fortunate enough to find a 

house that embraced him for who he was. 
He stressed that while being LGBTQ is 
significantly less stigmatized than just 
five years ago, there is still work to be 
done. But he encourages the LGBTQ 
community to approach IFC members 
with an open mind. 

“A lot of the openly gay people who 

feel they aren’t accepted in Greek life 
— not saying that they’re not facing 
adversity or obstacles, because they are 
— but some of that has more to do with 
their perception, and their unwilling-
ness to give people a chance,” Greene 
said. “Unfortunately as a minority, 
you’re always going to have that burden 
of breaking through that ceiling or going 
over that bump when it comes to meeting 
new people.”

Just a month into his junior year, it’s 

clear that Greene has left his signature 
on campus. Ask Trevor Gullstad, CJ Mot-

Personal Statement: A graduate student’s quarter-life 
crisis
“

What do you want 
to be when you 
grow up?”

This is a pretty 

common question 

for kids, but to someone who 
is almost 30? Actually, I often 
ask myself that same question, 
although in a slightly different 
way: What do I want to do 
with my life?

My career trajectory has 

never been linear. My goals 
changed constantly growing, 
shifting 
from 
actress 
to 

physician 
and 
everything 

in between. I started out 
as a pre-med biology major 
while an undergrad because I 
liked biology and I liked how 
medicine could make positive 
contributions to the society. 
But after researching at a 
plant pathology lab during my 
sophomore year, I realized 
I liked asking questions and 
finding answers in a lab more 
than learning from lectures. 
I was no longer looking up 
information about MCATs 
and 
medical 
schools 
but 

instead looking into doctoral 
programs and taking as many 
advanced, 
more 
focused 

biology classes to try to find 
my niche in biology. Of all 
branches in biology, genetics 
interested me the most, and 
so I decided to apply and join 
the Department of Human 
Genetics at the University of 
Michigan.

I thought: The decision 

was a drastic change in my 
plans, and I was set for life. 
All I needed to worry about 
was doing great science, and 
I would get to where I want 
to be. But like many things 
in life, it turns out you don’t 
really learn what a specific 
job entails until you’re fully 
immersed in it.

As a graduate student, I am 

expected to do much more 
than work on my thesis. I had 
two years of classes before I 
could even obtain my Ph.D. 
candidacy 
and 
work 
full 

time on my thesis. Achieving 
candidacy 
marks 
the 

transition between learning 
about your field from lectures 
to producing a body of cutting-

edge work to push the field 
forward.

Becoming a Ph.D. candidate 

is not an easy feat. For my 
department, students have 
to write a six-page grant 
proposal 
answering 
a 

question that is unrelated 
to their thesis projects. We 
have about a month to do 
background research, write a 
proposal and present 
the 
hypothetical 

project to five faculty 
members, who then 
grill us with questions 
for two hours before 
concluding whether a 
student is competent 
enough to pursue the 
track. I passed, but 
it is still a mystery to 
me how I survived 
the process without 
quitting or breaking 
down (although I did 
have a couple of panic 
attacks). 
Looking 

back, I think what 
got me through was 
the hope that I could 
finally work on my 
thesis project after 
this grueling process.

But after finally 

becoming 
a 
Ph.D. 

candidate, 
other 

obligations 
ensued: 

departmental 
activities 
like 

seminars, 
retreats 

and 
new 
student 

recruitment, 
fellowship 
applications, 
conferences, 
meetings 
with 
faculty 

members, and training junior 
lab members. With these 
overwhelming administrative 
tasks and other non-thesis-
related obligations, I simply 
did not feel as if I were in 
school 
to 
ask 
questions, 

perform 
experiments 
and 

learn science anymore. Most of 
all, I felt extremely uninspired. 
Doing research became more 
tolerable as I became more 
used to the system, but that 
was it — a tolerable day job. I 
felt like a robot.

In the middle of my third 

year, I began exploring career 

options outside academia. I 
evaluated why I was unhappy. 
First, I was expected to work 
on only a couple of projects 
for almost six years. Second, 
I was too focused on one 
specific topic — I was actually 
interested in many different 
topics in biology, not just one. 
My thesis project is about how 
cells minimize DNA errors, 

but I’m interested in other 
branches of biology too, like 
neuroscience. For instance, 
I love coffee, so I’ve written 
a couple times about how 
caffeine affects the brain. Last, 
I felt awfully isolated since 
only a few people in the world 
fully understand my thesis 
project. When work is such a 
big part of my life, not being 
able to talk about and share the 
same enthusiasm with most 
people is quite depressing.

One 
alternative 
route 

I thought of was science 
writing, specifically writing 
for the public. Writing has a 

shorter timeline — I can write 
about many different scientific 
topics, not just on topics that 
pertain to my thesis project. 
And my work will be read 
and understood by more than 
just a few. Plus, I’ve always 
liked writing and I’d begun to 
realize the growing need for 
clear, accurate and engaging 
science to general audiences. 

This is especially true now, as 
“alternative” and nonscientific 
facts (i.e., false statements) 
are readily accepted: climate 
change 
denial, 
the 
anti-

vaccine 
movement, 
GMO 

fearmongering and even the 
faux benefits of a gluten-free 
diet.

Even though Ph.D.-holders 

are pursuing nonacademic 
careers 
at 
an 
increasing 

rate, 
many 
programs 

are 
unequipped 
— 
even 

unsupportive — of students 
making 
that 
transition. 
I 

have sent countless emails 
to people I’d never even met 

at the University to see if 
they knew anything about 
science 
writing. 
While 

many responses were rather 
supportive (“It’s great to see a 
scientist interested in science 
writing!”), most couldn’t help 
(“But I know nothing about 
the field, so I cannot help you. 
Sorry!”).

The 
help 
came 
from 

somewhere 
unexpected. 
A friend of 
mine, whom 
I met during 
a 
graduate 

school 
interview, 
quit 
school 

to 
pursue 

science 
writing 
full 

time 
as 
a 

freelancer. 
We’d kept in 
contact 
on 

social media 
even 
after 

the interview, 
and when she 
saw 
several 

statuses 
about 
my 

quarter-life 
crisis, 
she 

contacted 
me. We had a 
conversation 
over 
Facebook 
and 
email, 

and I decided 
to give it one 
last try — I 
cold-emailed 

one more person, the current 
summer 
managing 
news 

editor at The Michigan Daily.

Since 
then, 
I’ve 
been 

involved with the Daily for 
almost two-and-a-half years 
as a news reporter and editor. 
Before I decided to leave to 
focus on my thesis project, 
I covered a broad range of 
topics 
from 
cutting-edge 

cancer research to a candlelit 
Black Lives Matter vigil at 
the Diag. I also helped launch 
MiSciWriters, 
a 
student 

organization that focuses on 
science writing and maintains 
a blog for trainees to practice 

writing and editing about 
science 
accessible 
to 
the 

public.

Some graduate students 

have told me that I am 
courageous (or insane — I’ve 
heard both) since being a 
graduate student is more 
than a full-time job, and being 
involved in extracurricular 
activities does not help me 
complete my thesis. But these 
extracurricular 
activities 

offered me one big component 
that scientific research alone 
cannot offer: people.

Scientists are people; we 

have to deal with human 
problems during our research 
— having other obligations 
outside work and school, 
getting sick, making mistakes, 
and having feelings and bias. 
Perhaps what really excites 
me about science writing is 
the opportunity to develop 
and hone my people skills 
on the job — the ability to 
share cool scientific facts, 
start 
discussions 
about 

controversial topics in science 
and portray scientists as 
people with feelings and 
problems, not callous robots.

I’ve met many fantastic 

people 
in 
my 
effort 
to 

transition into writing from 
academia, and they are the 
driving 
force 
behind 
my 

thesis 
work. 
Sometimes 

hearing supportive words or 
talking to inspiring people 
motivates me more than 
seeing numbers on an excel 
sheet. Documentaries, books, 
shows and other forms of 
storytelling inspired me to go 
into science — not numbers or 
graphs.

What do I want to be when I 

am done with my Ph.D.? What 
do I want to do for rest of my 
life? If you really think about it, 
the two questions are the same. 
We don’t expect an answer like 
“I want to be a good person” 
to either question. Instead, 
we expect to hear specific 
careers. But if you ask me right 
now, I can’t give you a normal 
answer. I don’t know what 
specific position I want, but I 
know I want to feel a little more 
human.

Personal Statement: Climb every mountain

T

he first mountain 
I 
climbed 
in 

Wyoming 
wasn’t 

even really a mountain. Mt. 
Ann is located directly behind 
Camp 
Davis, 
the 
Rocky 

Mountain Field Station owned 
and operated by the University 
of Michigan where students 
of all majors can take earth, 
environmental, 
American 

culture and ecology classes 
during the summer — so it’s 
a typical first hike for new 
students. When my class of 
about 20 students arrived after 
a two-and-a-half-day cross-
country caravan trip, we were 
told that we would be the next 
group to make the inaugural 
climb and that it would be 
an easy hike — the perfect 
starting point for a month of 
intense summits.

The hike began with our 

professors taking the lead 
while the class fell into a 
single-file line behind them. 
Our GSIs rounded up the 
back, carrying a cumbersome 
whiteboard for field lectures 
and prepared with bear spray 
and satellite radios. To my 
embarrassment and surprise, 
I found myself literally huffing 
and puffing after the first five 
minutes. All I could think was: 
“When will this incline end? It 
has to flatten out eventually. I 
can’t breathe!” Our professors 
noticed our sluggish pace and 
made 
several 
educational 

stops where we identified 
flowers and trees.

For me, the breaks were 

never long enough. As we 
climbed, I started to doubt 
myself.

If this were supposed to be 

our easiest hike, how was I 
going to survive the rest of the 
month? Worst-case scenarios 
were playing through my head, 
the most dramatic of which 
involved me calling home for a 
plane ticket back to Michigan.

I had never been so relieved 

and proud as the moment I 
reached the top of Mt. Ann 
after six hours of hiking. 
Surrounded by bright-yellow 
wildflowers and a view of the 
Grand Tetons in the distance, 

we sat down and had class 
right there on top of the 
mountain.

The rest of my month 

at Camp Davis was spent 
climbing actual mountains, 
as I would later learn to 
differentiate 
between 
the 

“glorified hill” that is Mt. 

Ann and the overwhelming 
monstrosities which are the 
Grand Tetons.

We hiked to an elevation 

of 11,000 feet on our first 
Teton hike, which dwarfed 
Mt. Ann in elevation and 
distance. As we walked, the 
trail transformed from forest, 
to open flower covered hills, 
to snow covered inclines that 
lead to snowball fights, belly 
slides, and a dramatic slip-
and-slide trip back down. 
Making it to the top was 
even more rewarding than 
Mt. Ann and the view made 
every mile worth it. There 

was a palpable excitement as 
we all took photos, gathering 
for a group picture with 
the block ‘M’ Michigan flag 
prominently featured. We still 
had a quick lesson, scribbling 
in our orange field notebooks 
as our professor described 
the life of 500,000-year-old 

stromatolites that were still 
present at the top.

I was exhausted by the 

time we made it back down, 
but I could already tell I 
was 
becoming 
acclimated 

to my new life in Wyoming. 
My tolerance for the thin 
air was growing, my body 
didn’t protest like it had on 
my first climb and I wasn’t 
plagued with thoughts of 
self-doubt, but was instead 
surprisingly impressed by my 
accomplishment.

On our second free day, 

we were fresh off a four-day 
camping trip in Yellowstone, 

and had chosen to camp in 
the Gros Ventre range and 
spend the Fourth of July in 
the Tetons. The crowds were 
intense due to the holiday, but 
we were determined to make 
it to Phelps Lake, where 
there was a perfect rock for 
cliff jumping. The class had 

split into groups for various 
activities, but each of us 
made it to the rock at some 
point that day, all with the 
intention of jumping into 
the freezing glacial melt.

My stomach had been 

turning 
all 
morning 
in 

anticipation and my anxiety 
grew rapidly as I watched my 
friends jump off one by one, 
some more gracefully than 
others. By the time it was 
my turn, I had already been 
sitting at the top for what felt 
like hours, nervously talking 
to people who had already 
jumped several times, trying 

to gain some confidence 
from their experience. Every 
time I approached the edge I 
was pulled back by the sight 
of the water 20 feet below 
me and the jutting edge of 
the rock — I’d have to propel 
myself forward to avoid it.

When I finally made the 

jump after at least 20 false 
starts, I was rewarded by 
cheers and applause that 
drowned out my scream. I 
collided with the icy water 
in a discombobulating blast. 
The fall was disorienting as 
the high drop leaves you in 
the air far longer expected. 
I came out of the water to 
another round of applause 
(I’m sure the other tourists 
were just happy that I was 
finally off the rock) as I 
swam to the edge where my 
classmates were waiting.

Like most of my Camp 

Davis experiences, I was 

surprised by and proud of 
myself. Just as I would have 
regretted not going to Camp 
Davis or not finishing the 
first hike, I would have left 
Phelps Lake hating myself if 
I were the only person who 
didn’t experience the jump. 
While not all my challenges 
in Ann Arbor can be equated 
to those at Camp Davis, it 
is comforting to think that 
if I jumped 20 feet into an 
icy lake or hiked to 11,000 
feet I can pretty much do 
anything.

On the last day our class 

we hiked Mt. Ann together 
one last time. We had just 
taken our final exam and 
spent the day relaxing in 
Jackson. We all wanted 
to end our trip the way it 
started. It had been just over 
three weeks since our first 
hike, but everything had 
already changed drastically. 
The hike was familiar yet 
entirely different as the trail 
had grown over and new 
wildflowers had come into 
season while the old ones now 
towered above our heads. 
But we had grown too. What 
had once been a challenging 
six-hour endeavor was now 
a relaxing and nostalgic 
conclusion that barely lasted 
an hour and a half.

While I had been looking 

forward to attending Camp 
Davis since high school, I 
was still nervous about the 
challenge that committing 
to a monthlong class in 
Wyoming with 20 strangers 
would 
bring. 
Everything 

about it was out of my comfort 
zone, but I knew that not only 
did I have to do it — it’s one 
way to fulfill the practical 
experience 
requirement 

for the PitE major — but I 
wanted to do it. As stressful 
as those first few days were, 
I am so thankful that I didn’t 
let my fear and anxiety hold 
me back.

My time at Camp Davis 

reinforced my passion for 
the environment and my 
confidence — personal and 
academic.

On September 24, I took a trip to Zingerman’s Deli to witness the making of 

paella, a traditional Spanish dish. My first sensation when photographing paella 
was intense heat — in part because I was standing under the sun without cover, 
but also because I was standing two feet from a burning charcoal grill. But as the 
fresh shrimp, bomba rice, seasonal vegetables, and saffron were added into the 
round paella pans, I no longer thought about the heat. Instead, I thought of the 
flavors and smells rising from the grill. I made the mistake of photographing on 

an empty stomach, and — yes — my mouth was watering the whole time.
