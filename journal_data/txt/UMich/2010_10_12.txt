UNIVERSITY ENDOWMENT

financials
awaited
In June, CFO Slottow predicted
an 11.5% growth for endowment,
which fell by 21% last year
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
The University will be publicly releasing the lat-
est estimate of its endowment value on Thursday at
the Board of Regents meeting, a highly-anticipated
announcement following the fund's dramatic drop in
value for the 2009 fiscal year.
The numbers that will be announced on Thursday
offer a freeze-frame of the endowment's total value as
of June 30, 2010 - the end of the University's 2010 fis-
cal year.
Last year, the University's endowment portfolio
fell by $1.6 billion, dropping from an all-time high of
$7.6 billion to $6 billion. The 21-percent drop hurt the
University's investment portfolio, but the loss on the
endowment was less significant than at some peer
institutions.
University spokeswoman Kelly Cunningham con-
firmed the returns and market value data for the
endowment and the University's investment portfolio
for the 2010 fiscal year are set to be released on Thurs-
day, but said that no details could be released prior to
the regents' meeting.
"It's my understanding that the annual report on
the University's investments will be presented to the
Board of Regents at Thursday's meeting. Among other
things the report will discuss the investment perfor-
mance of the endowment funds including total value
as of June 30,2010," Cunningham said.
However, in June, Tim Slottow, the University's
executive vice president and chief financial officer,
wrote in a communication to the regents that he pre-
dicted the endowment would post 11.5 percent growth
for the year. If that prediction held true, it would mean
the University's endowment would grow from $6 billion

With spotlight on bullying, campus
celebrates National Coming Out Day

Vigils, Diag event
highlight issues facing
LGBTQ students
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Students across campus commemo-
rated National Coming Out Day yes-

terday amidst heightened national and
local attention regarding the challeng-
es facing young LGBTQ students.
In addition to a Diag rally that fea-
tured a closet door that students sym-
bolically walked through and vigil
events that took place yesterday, there
are other events planned throughout
the week - dubbed National Coming
Out Week - including lectures regard-
ing LGBTQ issues and Michigan's Next

Top Drag Superstar Auditions.
In the past few months there have
been a rash of teen suicides that came
after the victims experienced bully-
ing based on assumed or actual sexual
orientation. The trend gained height-
ened media attention when Rutgers
University freshman Tyler Clementi
jumped off the George Washington
Bridge last month after two other Rut-
gers students filmed him having a sex-

ual encounter with another male and
broadcast it online.
The issue of cyberbullying has also
hit closer to home for the University
community after Michigan Student
Assembly President Chris Armstrong
became the target of a blog written by
a Michigan Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral Andrew Shirvell, which accuses
Armstrong of promoting a "radical

Distinguished prof.: Faculty must

Olivas: Students

an 'attractive' option
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
In a climate in which more and
more students are suing professors
over grades, inappropriate course
material and other issues, Michael
Olivas, the director of the Insti-

tute for Higher Education Law and
Governance at the University of
Houston, discussed in a speech yes-
terday the importance of sustaining
academic freedom for faculty in the
face of student lawsuits.
His lecture called, "God, Grades,
and Sex: The Developing Law of
the College Classroom," is the 20th
annual University of Michigan
Senate Assembly's Davis, Markert,
Nickerson Lecture on Academic
and Intellectual Freedom.
The Senate Assembly established

the lecture series in 1990 as a trib-
ute to three professors after they
refused to testify in 1954 to the
United States House of Representa-
tives Committee on Un-American
Activities. Two of the professors
were terminated and one was sus-
pended but then re-instated when
they refused to testify.
As he introduced Olivas, Univer-
sity Provost Phil Hanlon recognized
Chandler Davis among the audience
as one of the three professors.

AATA nets grant to revamp transit hub

Patients, doctors

Two years after Michigan vot-
ers approved the Michigan Medical
Marijuana Act, the state's medical

marijuana industry is still slowly
getting on its feet.
The ballot initiative passed in
November
2008 legal- Medical Marijuana

marijuana to !

conditions. But, qualifying patients
can't just walk into their local phar-
macies and pick up a prescription
for the drug. Instead, they have to

go through a slew of steps including
registering with the state, deciding
how to get the medicine and figur-
ing out for themselves how to dose
the medicine.
And because of federal drug
laws, they face obstacles at every
step of the process.

Many campus tours
include a legend chat Uni-
versity President Mary Sue
Coleman walks to work.
While some tour guides
stop there, others contin-
ue the campus lore, say-
ing that Coleman's on-foot
commute occurs in a secret
underground tunnel.
Simply put, only one of
the tour guides is actually
telling the truth.
Coleman does walk from
the President's House on
South University Avenue
to work, but her commute
isn't some mysterious sub-
terranean journey, instead,
it takes place on the same
sidewalks that thousands
of students use each day
on their way to and from
classes.
Asked about the myth

last month, Coleman
laughed at the suggestion
that she might walk to work
underground.
"I've heard this one myth
that there's a secret tun-
nel and that I walk to work
in it," Coleman said. "And
t've thought 'Where is this
mythical tunnel?"'
However, it is true that
most students probably
don't see Coleman when
she walks to work in the
morning. Her walk usually
takes place before eight in
the morning, when many
students are hitting their
snooze buttons for the first
time or are still fast asleep.
"I walk every day to
work, above ground," Cole-
man said.
And while the myth
about Coleman's daily walk

to work in the depths of
the earth can't be traced
back to a single person or
an exact moment in time,X
there is a likely source of
the lore..
Coleman said she thinks
the fact that there is amlxste ofudr
ground utility tunnels on
campus lends itself to cre-
ating a myth the she uses
them to walk to her office
in the Pleming Administra-
tion Building..
However, these utilityy1 _
tunnels aren't very user-
friendly to walk through
- at least not in Coleman's
opinion.
"There's all these utility
tunnels, but I don't think
anyone would want to walk
in them," Coleman said. University President Mary Sue Coleman walks to the Fletcher AdministrationB
- KYLE SWANSON from the Uninersity President's House in 20tt5.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Detroit Schools to go
to student homes to
raise attendance
Attendance agents are going
door-to-door in search of Detroit
students who have not made it to
class.
The district says the agents
spoke yesterday to parents whose
children have missed class time
or failed to make it to school for
Count Day last month.
Students must attend class full-
time for the financially struggling
district to receive full funding
from the state. Fall attendance
Count Day is one of two dates used
to determine how much money
each school district gets from the
state.
Detroit has surpassed its 76,053
student goal for the fall, but some
have not attended full-time or
remained in class for the entire
day.
A final count is due Oct. 29.
Detroit has lost nearly 100,000
students since 1997, when enroll-
ment was 175,168.
CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida
Pending funding
approval, NASA to
launch new shuttle
There's still the matter of
money. But it looks increasingly
likely that NASA will get an extra
space shuttle flight.
President Barack Obama signed
the NASA 2010 Authorization Act
into law yesterday, following last
week's approval by Congress. The
measure directs NASA to move
forward with an additional shuttle
flight, before retiring the fleet.
U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson says the
funding issue should be resolved
once Congress returns to Wash-
ington in a lame duck session next
month.
Only two shuttle launches offi-
cially remain, with the next one
coming up Nov. 1. The extra space
station delivery mission would
take place next June.
Nelson says the additional flight
will ease the impact of shuttle job
cuts.
MOSCOW, Russia
Russian spy makes
* public appearance
post-exposure
A Russian bank says it hired the
spy Anna Chapman to help with
innovation in information tech-
nology.
Yesterday's statement from
FondServisBank is intended
to explain Chapman's sudden
appearance last week at a remote
cosmodrome for the launch of
a Russian-American crew. The
bank works with aerospace com-
panies.
With her flaming red hair and
penchant for posting sultry pho-
tos of herself on social networking
sites, Chapman is the most famous

of the 10 sleeper spies arrested in
U.S. this summer and then sent
back to Russia in a spy swap.
She has avoided the media and
the public since her return, so
her appearance at the launch site
caused a sensation.
In the United States, she was
accused of using her technological
savvy in her work as a spy.
LANSING
State income tax
revenue runs above
expected amount
Income tax revenue is coming in
higher than expected in Michigan,
a sign that more people are work-
ing or earning more money.
Gov. Jennifer Granholm said
yesterday that the state general
fund is expected to have about
$100 million more than state econ-
omists estimated in May when the
books are closed on the budget
year that ended Sept. 30.
She calls the $100 million "a
significant chunk of money,"
although it's only a tiny percent-
age of the $7.8 billion general fund.
0 The state uses that fund to pays for
everything from prisons to food
inspections and health care for
low-income residents.
Although income tax revenue
is up, money from the state's main
business tax is lower than expect-
*ed.
Revenue for the school aid fund
is running slightly above expecta-
tions.

Daily wire reports.

REGENTS
From Page 1A
to $6.69 billion.
An increase of that nature
would put the University's endow-
ment performance on par with
that of other schools across the
country, who have similarly seen
their endowments rebound some-
what from significant losses in
2009.
Harvard University saw an
11-percent bump this year, which
helped to offset a 27.3-percent loss
in its endowment value last year.
Similarly, Yale University saw an
8.9-percent increase in its endow-
ment value, which had dropped
24.6 percent in 2009, and the Uni-
versity of Virginia gained 12.5 per-
cent on its endowment, which fell
by 21 percent in 2009.
The University's Board of
Regents voted to lower the Uni-
versity's endowment payout rule
over the summer, lowering the
annual payout from 5 percent to
4.5 percent of the seven-year aver-
aged value. Over time, this change
will mean that the University is
required to pay out a smaller per-
centage of the endowment's total
value each year.
ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT
REQUESTS $3M MORE FOR
CRISLER REVAMP
The regents will also consider
a proposal to increase funding for
a project approved in January to
renovate Crisler Arena.
The regents previously
approved a $20 million proposal to
replace the seats in the lower bowl
of the arena, which will bring the
University in line with the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act.
Additionally, the previously
approved project will relocate,
widen and add handrails to the
aisles in seating areas. It will also
replace the roof and remove asbes-
tos from the building and replace
heating and ventilation units and
implement a new electrical sys-
tem.
Updates to critical safety sys-
tems are also expected as part of
the project, including a new fire
detection, alarm and suppression
system, as well as a new smoke
evacuation system and emergency
exit lighting.
The regents approved a sche-
matic design for the project in
July, when it was also announced
that the student section would
be moved to the west side of the

stadium and the band would be
moved to the north end of the sta-
dium.
According to a communication
sent to the regents, the additional
$3 million is being requested so
upper-bowl seating can also be
replaced. Similar to the already
approved lower-bowl seating
replacement, aisles would be
widened and handrails would be
added.
Funding for the project, if
approved as revised, would be
provided by the Athletic Depart-
ment, with construction expected
to be completed in winter 2012.
REGENTS TO CONSIDER
WORK ON SIMPSON CIRCLE
PARKING STRUCTURE
The University's Board of
Regents is also expected to
approve a renovation of the Simp-
son Circle Parking Structure on
the Medical Campus on Thursday.
The structure was built in 1975
and has since undergone only
minor repairs and improvements,
according to a communication
sent to the regents by Slottow and
Ora Pescovitz, the University's
executive vice president for medi-
cal affairs.
Renovations are intended to
designate approximately 470
parking spaces, currently used by
staff, to patient andvisitor parking
for the new C.S. Mott Children's
and Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital, while also bringing the
structure up to current standards.
The project's scope includes
repainting, new lighting, new
directional signage, guardrail
improvements and modifications
to the entrances and exits of the
structure. A new pedestrian
bridge connecting to the hospital
has also been proposed.
Pescovitz and Slottow wrote
in their communication that the
University's strategic parking and
transportation plan would address
staff parking needs, which would
include the use of additional com-
muter parking lots on North Cam-
pus.
The project is estimated to cost
$3.15 million and, if approved,
would be financed by resources
from the University's Hospitals
and Health Centers as well as
Parking and Transportation Ser-
vices.
Construction is expected to be
completed in the fall of 2011.

MARIJUANA
From Page 1A
ule I drug under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act. Schedule I is the most
restrictive out of the five drug clas-
sifications listed under the act. The
category consists of drugs that have
a high potential for abuse and no
accepted medical use in the United
States. In 2001, the DEA denied a
petition to make marijuana a less
restricted classification, citing its
lack of medical use as the primary
reason.
With major discrepancies between
state and federal attitudes toward
medical marijuana, it's no surprise
that things haven't been smooth sail-
ing for the industry since the drug was
legalized for medical use. Physicians
and policy makers agree that there's
a lack of federally supported research
on the medical benefits of the drug.
Despite avow from President Barack
Obama's administration not to
penalize legal medical marijuana
operations, many doctors, marijuana
providers and patients fear federal
prosecution. These difficulties, along
with the stigma associated with mar-
ijuana, make it difficult to obtain and
use the drug legally.
As Ann Arbor resident Connie
Bank, who uses marijuana for her
arthritis and fibromyalgia, put it, the
industry is a little bit like "the wild
wild west."
Mike Meno, the director of com-
munications for the Marijuana Policy
Project - the organization respon-
sible for drafting Michigan's medical

marijuanalaw- saidthat withmedi-
cal marijuana laws already in place in
14 states and under consideration in
others, pressure on the federal gov-
ernment to reconsider its views on
marijuana is building.
"We're really reaching a critical
mass where the federal government
can't keep its head in the sand any-
more," Meno said.
According to the Marijuana Policy
Project website, there are currently
three pieces of legislation under
consideration in the United States
Congress that, if passed, would sig-
nificantly impact federal drug policy.
The Personal Use of Marijuana by
Responsible Adults Act would allow
citizens to possess up to 3.5 ounces
of marijuana without facing fed-
eral criminal penalties. The Medical
Marijuana Patient Protection Act
would legalize medical marijuana
nationwide. The Truth in Trials Act
would protect state-sanctioned med-
ical marijuana patients and caregiv-
ers from federal criminal penalties.
In 2009, the American Medical
Association announced that it sup-
ported further research into mari-
juana's medical benefits.
"Our American Medical Associa-
tion (AMA) urges that marijuana's
status as a federal Schedule I con-
trolled substance be reviewed with
the goal of facilitating the conduct
of clinical research and development
of cannabinoid-based medicines,"
AMA reported.
As the country continues to adjust
its views of marijuana, Michigan's
medical marijuana industry contin-
ues tostruggle with not only a lack

of federally supported research, but
also with the stigma that comes with
building an industry around a sched-
ule I drug.
Mike McLeod, one of the founders
of the Ann Arbor Medical Marijuana
Patient Collective, said many people
are uncomfortable with a legalized
form of marijuana because ithas been
criminalized forso long.
"There's still alot of fear," he said.
"There's a lot of people in the com-
munitywhohaveseen (marijuana) as
being illegal. They've watched peo-
ple go to jail. They've watched par-
ents lose their children. They've been
told their whole life that ifyougrow a
marijuanaplant, you'llgotoprison."
When Connie Bank's doctor, who
she said is the "go-to-guy" in Ann
Arbor for arthritis and lupus, gave
her written certification to qualify
for medical marijuana, he asked her
not to tell anyone.
"He believes that it works, he's just
afraid," she said.
Despite the obstacles in their path,
medical marijuana patients, caregiv-
ers and advocates vow to continue
building the industry throughout
the next few years. At the end of the
August A2M2PC meeting, which
occurred one week after Ann Arbor's
City Council passed a moratorium
on new medical marijuana dispensa-
ries, Dennis Hayes, another founder
of A2M2PC and a local lawyer who
specializes in medical marijuana
legislation, looked out at the group
of patients and caregivers with a big
smile on his face.
"It's going to be a whale of fun for
the next three to five years," he said.


COMING OUT

homosexual agenda." The Univer-
sity community rallied around Arm-
strong after the blog and Shirvell's
appearances on campus criticizing
Armstrong gained national media
attention.
Gabe Javier, assistant director of
the Spectrum Center, said the week-
long celebration coincides with the
anniversary of the first march for
Lesbian and Gay rights that took
place in Washington, D.C. in 1979.
"This week is symbolic not just
for Michigan but for people all over
in the LGBTQ community," Javier
said. "We celebrate it here to really
show people that it's possible to live
out happy, healthy lives and to really
combat the messages of homophobia
in our society."
As part of the week-long cel-
ebration, the Spectrum Center held
GlowLight Vigils at Bursley Hall,
the Hill area and at Regents' Plaza
to provide a "beam of hope," for
LGBTQ students and allies, in light of
recently publicized suicides, accord-
ing to Javier. He said the vigil was a
good first step to combating the issue
of bullying and said the Spectrum

Center will be working with various
student groups throughout the year
to make certain that school adminis-
trators and policymakers are taking a
"proactive stance" to bullies.
Social Workstudent Gabe Radeka,
co-coordinator of the vigil, said the
event aimed to inspire students and
provide an opportunity to show sup-
port for both students who identify
as LGBTQ and community allies.
"We want to show solidarity,"
Radeka said. "We want to send the
message thatitgetsbetter."
Radeka said the vigil also served
to raise awareness about challenges
that young people who identify as
LGBTQ might face.
"It's about resilience and honor-
ing those who have felt like they
didn't have any other choice besides
suicide," Radeka said. "Plus it's on
National Coming Out Day so it's also
aspace to think about the fact that for
people coming outisn'tsafe."
She added that this was the first
year the vigil was held in three loca-
tions, which gave more students an
opportunitytoparticipate.
"It's a container for people to come
together and have some feelings and
be inspired to do the hard work that's
ahead," Rabeka said.
LSA freshman Alex Ngo said he

found the vigil to be "really inspira-
tional."
"I just came out of the closet and
to see so many people here who are
just like me was really amazing," Ngo
said.
LSA junior Alex Brown said he
found the event to be "fantastic,"
adding that he thought it showed an
element ofcampus unity.
LSA junior Kelsey Strait said the
event reaffirmed her views on the
University community.
"It really shows that this cam-
pus is really accepting of everything
because there was such a great
turnout," Strait said. "I'm just really
happy to go here and be surrounded
by people who are so accepting of
others."
LSA freshman Sarah Szollar said
the atmosphere allowed her to "real-
ly feel the comraderie."
Radeka said she felt it too. As an
undergraduate at the University 20
years ago, Radeka said she didn't
see as much visible support for
LGBTQ students and allies as she
does now.
Javier said he hopes the events will
help students realize that the Univer-
sity is a safe place for them to be.
"We need allies to be out, identified
as allies of the LGBTQ community."


AATA
From Page 1A
At the start of the press confer-
ence, Griffith said the demand for
public transportation in the city
continues to grow, with a 40-per-
cent increase in ridership of AATA's
fixed route bus service in the past
five years. This represents an even
greater increase than the state-
wide growth in public transporta-
tion usage, which was a 22-percent
boostcthroughout the past six years,
he said.
All of the speakers at the press
conference, including CEO of
AATA Michael Ford, thanked
Dingell for making the city's voice
heard in Washington, D.C. At $1
million, the federal grant - which
is aFederal Transit Administration
State of Good Repair project - will
cover part of the project's cost, as
the total expenditure is estimated
at about $4 million, Ford said in an
interview after the press confer-
ence. The remaining $3 million
will be funded through "several
different pots of money" the AATA
has access to, including state dol-
lars and "district grants," he said.
The renovation is slated to begin
in the spring of 2011 and conclude
by the summer of 2012. The new
transit center will have an added
floor, which will increase the size
of the current building from 2,000
square feet to about 6,000 square
feet, Ford said during the press con-
ference.
Mayor John Hieftje also spoke
at the event, thanking Dingell for
his help in getting federal grants
for the city.
Hieftje said the renovated tran-
sit center is going to be a "great
addition" to the city, adding that
it will encourage Ann Arbor resi-
dents to continue their high rate of
public transportation usage.
Dingell took the floor next and
said that Ann Arbor's public trans-
portation system is "a great and
enthusiastic public service" that
contributes to a better "quality of
life" for the city's residents. He rec-
ognized Hieftje's and other public
officers' hard work in spearhead-
ing various city projects, like the
transit center renovation.
"...Understand that this is the
result of hard work and real vigor
and real mission because, as the
Bible tells us, 'Without a vision,
people perish,"' Dingell said.
Susan Pollay, executive direc-
tor of the Ann Arbor Downtown
Development Authority, said

better transportation in the city
means more customers will come
into the city and make it easier for
employees of Ann Arbor business-
es to commute.
"Here in downtown Ann Arbor,
we know that the small, indepen-
dent businesses and the new econ-
omy companies are the groups that
are going to be generating the jobs
of the future," Pollay said.
Ford said that while there may
be some changes to the AATA bus
routes as a result of the construc-
tion, the authority is going to do
everything it can to have as few
"disruptions as possible." He also
said that while the new center is
being built, the existing building
will still be functional to minimize
disturbances for customers.
There is also currently con-
struction on Ann Arbor's Down-
town Library parking lot on South
Fifth Avenue, one block over from
the Blake Transit Center. And
while several of the speakers at the
press conference said the timeline
of the two construction projects
mayoverlap, Hieftje said he doesn't
foresee this being too problematic.
The renovation of the Blake
Transit Center is part of a greater
countywide push to increase the
accessibility and availability of
public transportation in the area,
Ford said.
As part ofthis plan,in the future
AATA plans to work on introduc-
ing transportation from the Blake
Transit Center to Detroit Metro
Airport, he said.
Ypsilanti resident Jessica
Gransden said she uses Ann
Arbor's public transportation sys-
tem about 10 times a day, going to
and from home, work and class at
Washtenaw Community College.
She said a renovated transit cen-
ter would be a welcomed change,
as the current building is often
crowded with people waiting for
buses in the winter.
"I think it would help," Grans-
densaid. "...It'susually packed wall
to wall."
Ann Arbor resident Thomas
Krawford, Jr., who uses the Ann
Arbor's buses to get to work at a
local high school every day, said
he's open to the idea of a new
transit center, though he's con-
cerned about the cost of the con-
struction.
"I suppose on the one hand
progress is a good thing but on
the other hand nothing is totally
perfect," Krawford said. "There's
always some sort of drawback in
the long run."


LECTURE
From Page 1A
In front of an audience of about
80 people, Olivas discussed the
increasing trend in higher education
of students suing professors. Olivas
said the number of lawsuits has been
on the rise since the 1960s.
"It is very clear that this is a path-
way that students have found attrac-
tive," Olivas said.
Giving several examples of stu-
dent-teacher lawsuits, Olivas said
some of the confusion in court rul-
ings on the issue stems from the
courts viewing professors as spokes-
people of their public institutions.
With this view, Olivas said profes-
sors are condemned forspeakingout
for or against religion.
Sometimes these condemnations
are unjust, Olivas said, as with the
example of a Mormon theatre stu-
dent who refused to read and act out

material she felt was sacrilegious. In
this case, Olivas said he felt it was the
professor's right to choose his class-
room materials and assignments.
Though these professors may be
condemned for the wrong reasons,
Olivas said he does recognize that
there are some professors who take
too many liberties with course mate-
rial and their treatment of students.
Olivas cited one professor who
used Hustler magazine as assigned
reading for his remedial English
class, which made his students feel
unintelligent and uncomfortable.
As an overall solution to the legal
issues faculty members face, Olivas
said a university must recognize
that its different departments have
different modes of instruction.
But in addition to giving autono-
my to faculty, universities ought to
have institutional norms and codes
of conduct in place, Olivas said. He
added that senior faculty members
must teach these norms to junior

faculty members, so that the faculty
can become self-monitoring.
Olivas said that by using a system
like this, members of a faculty can
feel comfortable standing together
if one is the target of a lawsuit.
"If they're under assault, all of us
are under assault," he said.
In an interview after the lecture,
Olivas said he is passionate about
the issue of academic freedom given
the nature of the threat it poses to all
educators.
"I believe in the enterprise, and
I want to make it a better place to
work and live and do my research,"
he said. "When anybody else's inter-
ests are harmed, I think they threat-
en all of our interests."
Jack Bernard, the University's
assistant general counsel, said he
has been to every lecture in the
series since 1995, adding, "academic
freedom is a very important prin-
ciple that the University needs to
support."

A healthy verdict
Courts should uphold federal health care reform
.S. courts have been in limbo for months debating the
legality of federal health care reforms. But last week,
some of the legal squabbling that still surrounds the
reforms was hushed. A U.S. District Court judge in Detroit
released a decision supporting the federal government's right
to implement the health care reforms signed into law in March.
This is written consent that validates the reforms. Though the
law is still controversial, it's a valuable effort to make health care
available to people who desperately need it. The recent district
court decision addresses legal qualms and should be considered
s a precedent for future lawsuits.
On Thursday, the Detroit Free Press and 19 other attorneys general from across
reported that US District Court Judge the nation have also filed lawsuits against

George Steeh issued a decision that refused
to stop the implementation of the federal
health care reforms, which are sched-
uled to go into effect in 2014. Steeh is the
first judge to make a ruling on one of sev-
eral cases nationwide that claim Congress
exceeded its legal rights when it passed the
law requiring Americans to obtain health
insurance. Steeh's decision argued that pur-
chasing healthcare was a matter of inter-
state trade and is therefore within federal
jurisdiction.
Though the health care law may be con-
tentious nationally - some consider it too
extreme, while others think it lacks essen-
tial components - it is based in a dire
need to make health care more accessible.
According to an Oct. 8 Detroit Free Press
article, there are nearly 1.3 million Michi-
gan residents lacking health care coverage.
The federal health care law that was signed
into law in March will allow these residents
easy access to an affordable health care
system. Citizens have a duty to promote
and support policies - like the health care
reforms - that are socially responsible and
better the welfare of others.
Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox

the federal mandate of health care. The
lawsuits argue that the federal govern-
ment cannot force people to buy a good
solely because they are citizens. Many legal
experts contend that the central legal ques-
tion surrounding the law is whether the
Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution,
which states that Congress can regulate
trade and business between states, allows
the federal legislature to mandate that citi-
zens purchase health insurance.
Steeh's decision has set a promising prec-
edent, arguingthatthe health care laws are a
matter of interstate trade and therefore pro-
tected under the clause. His refusal to halt
implementation of the reforms reinforces
the constitutional legality of the health care
laws that are so necessary for Americans
who struggle to afford pricey health care
plans. Other judges must consider Steeh's
decision when determining an outcome.
The lawsuits currently being fought
across the nation are bound to have as pro-
found of an impact as Steeh's. This prec-
edent shouldn't be overlooked as the other
lawsuits are considered. Others should con-
sider Judge Steeh's opinion as a precedent
for federal health care reform lawsuits.

This past Thursday, the pro-
life campus group "Students
for Life" hosted Dr. Alveda
King - Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.'s
niece and a promi-
nent spokesperson
for the pro-life
movement - to
answer the ques-
tion "How Will
The Dream Sur-
vive?"
When I first saw LIBBY
the event adver-
tised in my class- ASHTON
room in Angell
Hall, I didn't
notice the "Hosted
by Students for Life" tag and thought
King was coming to speak about race
relations in the 21st century. Then I
made the connection and realized the
event was on behalf of the pro-life
position. I felt angry.
I resented Students for Life for
what seemed like a strategy to attract
people to the event who may want
to know how the dream - MLK Jr.'s
dream - will survive without the
implicit antecedent, "if we murder our
children," which King stated in her
speech Thursday. I resented King for
standing in the national light of her
uncle and his work while advocating
for a position that cannot - without
rigorous justification - be blanketed
under the moral rightness that besets
his Civil Rights Movement.
Leaders of the debate - assum-
ing their objective is to win a truth,
not an argument - have a duty to
make progress in our collective
understanding of the reasons behind
each side's position. I assumed King
would walk the audience through her
understanding of the relationship
between the Civil Rights Movement
and the anti-abortion movement,
beyond simply stating that there is
one. I assumed that, as a leader in
the movement and as someone who
flaunts her relation to one of the most

powerful orators in the last century,
she would tell me something I hadn't
heard before.
But she didn't. She told sto-
ries of her family history and reli-
gious awakening while walking us
through a PowerPoint presentation
that included statements like, "Satan
hates ... homosexual same sex ...
yuck!" She retold the story of Dred
Scott, the African American who was
told he couldn't sue in federal court
because he wasn't a citizen, and par-
alleled it to the status of the fetus as a
slave inside the woman's womb. Her
presentation was disheveled and her
logic was unsophisticated at best -
criticisms I make not because I want
to paint the opposition in a bad light
but because my expectations for their
arguments are high.
I don't believe that supporters of
the pro-life movement are too stupid
or too close-minded to understand
my position. And I hope they don't
believe that I'm too stupid or too sin-
ful to understand theirs. King appar-
ently believes that I, as an advocate for
choice, am in support of mass murder
that carries the same moral weight
as the Holocaust and the slave trade.
I, on the other hand, believe she is in
support of the mass oppression of the
rights of people on behalf of a fun-
damentally religious conviction that
Satan loves non-procreative sexuality.
I can't simply accept our difference of
opinions when the moral stakes are so
high. I feel a responsibility to probe
further to find the point at which our
convictions diverge.
I walked into King's event with
a strong sense as to the differ-
ence between slavery and abor-
tion. I walked in thinking she would
acknowledge that members of her
audience had considered the par-
allel before and may have come up
with some valuable reasons as to
why the parallel between civil rights
and abortion doesn't hold. As I left
King's talk, I resented her for failing
to acknowledge that her opposition's

argument is at least worthy of con-
sideration and a response - if for no
other reason than to strengthen her
own argument.
I think my resentment stems from
the dissonance I experience between
what I've been able to reason (which
is that abortion is not morally repre-
hensible) and the convictions of many
people for whom I have personal and
intellectual respect. I feel frustrated
by the debate because it seems that
highly intelligent and capable people
continue to throw around the same
arguments and maintain the same
misconceptions about the world-
views of the opposing side without
getting any closer to the crux of the
debate.
Pro-life advocacy
shouldn't capitalize
on MLK's fame.
I know supporters of the pro-
life movement can do better than
the talk King gave Thursday night
because I've seen them do better. I
hope that the pro-life supporters who
attended the talk don't excuse King's
flawed and blatantly religiously and
personally biased assertions sim-
ply because she and MLK Jr. stand
in the same family portrait. Leaders
of this debate - and others like it -
shouldn't get away with resting their
arguments on unqualified cliches and
bigoted references to scripture. So
let's hope the rest of us understand
the importance of uncovering the
fundamental truth at the core of this
argument, which will require a high-
er standard of debate than that which
King displayed.

ASHLEY GRIESSHAMMER I
Reevaluate job outsourcing

Will you protect this house?

As the Nov. 2 election date draws closer,
gubernatorial candidates Rick Snyder and Virg
Bernero have recently engaged in their first
side-by-side debate. The hot topic of conver-
sation? Outsourcing jobs. Bernero made some
heated accusations toward Snyder about his
past as president of computer maker Gateway,
condemning him as the "chief executive out-
sourcer," according to an Oct. 10 article from
annarbor.com. It seems that Michigan jobs
will be a prominent issue in this gubernatorial
race, as they should be. I can't help but won-
der, though, was Snyder's outsourcing of jobs
for Gateway really as horrific as Bernero makes
it seem?
Obviously, outsourcing jobs from the state
will never be a good thing. Michigan's unem-
ployment rate is a major problem that every
person in office wants to fix and I certainly
agree that it needs to be addressed. But I can't
blame the companies for doing what's best for
them. In many cases, these corporations are
forced to outsource jobs because their survival
depends on it.
Take Gateway, for example. Under Snyder's
watch, the company grew from less than 1,000
employees to about 10,000. However, when
sales started to fall in response to market com-
petition, the company was forced to outsource
jobs overseas in order to survive. While it's
unfortunate that this sales decline occurred
while Snyder was present and that he was
forced to make some tough decisions, he was
not wrong for doing what had to be done. As
a businessman, Snyder was willing to do what
was necessary for the well being of his com-
pany.
I'm simply using Snyder as an example here.
At this point in time, I don't endorse him or
any other candidate for that matter. But many
people are blaming the executives at big com-
panies for outsourcing jobs away from not
only Michigan but also other states, claiming
that these corporations only want to make a

buck. And I simply can't place all of the blame
on them. As high-powered executives, it's in
their job description to make tough decisions
for their corporations, and the best interest of
the company must always be put first. These
companies are in business to make a profit, and
they should do so using any means necessary.
Manufacturing jobs are the easiest jobs to
outsource to another country. They don't really
require any specialized skills, and most people
can be trained relatively quickly to work with
machinery. It's unfortunate that the largest
industry in Michigan used to be manufactur-
ing, and as the economy declines and compa-
nies are forced to make cuts, those are the first
jobs to go. It seems that the only safe jobs are
the ones that can only be performed by work-
ers here and those that require a high level of
education.
I also believe that our country, including its
economy, is founded on capitalism. Companies
are simply running their businesses using a
capitalistic model. And if we complain about
them outsourcing jobs, we are essentially
complaining about them being capitalists. If a
company is not always focused on turning over
a big profit, it won't be very successful. Out-
sourcing jobs is certainly not the most pleas-
ant way to keep a company afloat, but if cutting
costs is necessary, it's definitely effective.
So as the gubernatorial race continues to
move forward, I encourage people to think
about the topic of outsourcing jobs. Bernero
wants to keep jobs in Michigan under any cir-
cumstances, and while he has good intentions,
I wonder if he can ever accomplish this goal.
There is no denying that as we move forward as
a society, low-skilled labor will begin to leave
our job market to be shipped overseas. The
new focus here needs to be on education, in an
effort to train workers who will become irre-
placeable to their companies.

would provide bet-
ter pass coverage SZKARLAT
than they do. And
you can think what
you like.
But don't you dare turn your back
on this House.
There are a few groups that always
stay until the very end of the game,
including the football team and the
marching band. You probably don't
come to see the marching band, butI
can tell you that as a member, we felt
the same pain and agony as you did
while watching the game on Satur-
day. I lost my voice for a week after
we played University of Massachu-
setts. I shudder to think when it will
come back after our team's perfor-
mance on Saturday. I was almost in
tears as I screamed, "Where was the
coverage? Where was it?"
But the marching band - by
implied mission statement - stays
until the very last second. And I
didn't like what I heard or what I saw
this past weekend. By the end of the
game, there were more Spartans in
the Big House than Wolverines.
And they cheered. They jumped up
and down and sang their fight song,
and it echoed across the stadium,
across the stands and through the

east side tunnel, bouncing between
the press boxes and lingering in our
ears. And what happened when we
- the Michigan Marching Band -
played "The Victors"? Maybe a few
people half-heartedly put their fists
in the air and put their hands together
to sing the best college fight song ever
written. This isn't a new problem. It
happened last year with Ohio State
too. Michigan fans were forced to sit
and listen to "O-H-I-O" echo through
the Big House. Our Big House.
But we don't need a win in football
to be the Victors. We are the Victors
when we win, and we are the Vic-
tors when we lose. Being the Victors
means more now than it did when
Louis Elbel wrote those words in 1898
and set them to that song. The Victors
are proud. The Victors are unshaken
by defeat. The Victors stay until the
last second of every game and cheer
their team on as it leaves the field.
The team, the team, the team.
We need a corollary to Bo Schem-
bechler's speech. Famously, he said
to the football team, "No man is more
important than the team. No coach is
more important than the team." But
I wish he had added, "No fan is more
important than the team."
What that means is that we are a
team together. The band, the fans, the
players, the coach - every last one of
us is a member of a larger team. We
are the Victors. The Leaders and the
Best. We are the Michigan Faithful.
The Wolverines. We are the Maize
and Blue.
Whether or not you think Rich
Rod is the best or worst coach to have
ever existed, or if you lie somewhere
in between, you are still the Michi-
gan Faithful. Whether you worship
Denard Robinson or think he's over-
hyped, you are the Michigan Faith-

ful. The fact is that it doesn't matter,
because the team is more important
than any coach or player.
No fan is
more important
than the team.
Those who stay will be champions.
Every embarrassing defeat wit-
nesses Michigan fans turning their
backs on the field and walking out of
the stadium. I'm sure even more fans
shut off their TVs at home and go out-
side to get some fresh air and relax
after the tension of our failures. And
because of this, our team, our program
and our winning tradition falter. That
Big House - our coliseum and our
home - falls to the green and white,
the scarlet and gray. And I believe it
begs the question, originally posed to
the football team and marching band
by Drum Major David Hines, Jr., "Will
you protect this House?"
We may be down. But we are not
out. We are never out. We are all in. If
you're turning your TV off or selling
your tickets because we're losing, you
can stay away when we're winning
too. If you take off the maize and blue
now, don't bother putting it back on
again. Riding in on the coattails of our
victory does not make you champions.
If you do not stay, even in the face of
ugly defeat, you are not a champion.
But I will stay. And I will protect
this House.

Gucci Mane proves
prison does work

By EMMA GASE
Daily Arts Writer
It seems nowadays that rap's southern
titans are spending more time in the
slammer than in the studio. Weezy's out
of commission for the
time being and T.t. was
released last spring
after almost a year Gucci Mane
in the can. Atlanta's
Gucci Mane, like his The Appeal:
reckless peers, is no Georgia's
stranger to the joint. Most Wanted
Though these not- Waner Bros,
quite-upstanding citi-
zens have been busy
paying their civic debt, there seems to
be no shortage of releases coming from
these rappers.
Gucci Mane's latest release comes
fresh off his six-month stint in Fulton
County Jail. With The Appeal: Georgia's
Most Wanted, Gucci is one step closer
to becoming a household name rather
than a hidden gem from the streets. The
Appeal shows no sign of Gucci quitting
the roll he has been on since 2009's The
State vs. Radric Davis. Incarceration
serves him well.
The Appeal features Gucci's regular
circle of guests, including crooner Ray J
on R&B burner "Remember When" and
the ubiquitous Nicki Minaj on dreamy
"Haterade." However, Bun B takes the
prize for fiercest guest appearance on
album leadoff "Little Friend," as he

gritty guests.
seems about one inch away from beating
someone into the ground. But despite his
aggression, he still manages to intimi-
date listeners in a kid-friendly way: "You
look like a clown / Take the red ball off
your nose / Bitches sit yo ass down," he
snarls. Mostly kid-friendly, then.
"Making Love to the Money" kicks
off the album's first blatant dance-on-
the-table party jam. Gucci deadpans
exactly what the title implies: "Makin'

love to the money like a sex tape / I'm
talkin' Kim K / I'm talkin' Ray J." A
driving organ-like synth and a surpris-
ingly full production beat keeps the
song captivating from the first intro
beat to the last ringing proclamation of
"'S Gucci!"
Guest Swizz Beatz's stamp is promi-
nent on The Appeal's lead single and
album standout "Gucci Time." The furi-
ous stop-and-start looping beat sounds
like a tinny broken record (in the thug-
gest way possible) reminiscent of classic
Swizz production on Jay-Z's "On to the
Next One."
Gucci does miss the mark, however,
on Wyclef-assisted "Odog." With an
awkward and screechy electric guitar
buried under a schmaltzy beat, Wyclef
underwhelms with bland lines like "Sky
is the limit now / My jet just took off the
ground now / Ain't nobody gonna stop
my destiny." Good thing this lackluster
track won't get any airtime on Wyclef's
shut-down political campaign trail.
Gucci's greatest strength perhaps lies
in his nonchalant, muffled monotone.
He delivers his lines with a tone as dry
as the Sahara, whether he is rapping
about money (his favorite topic), women
(a close second) or the pressures of being
Gucci Mane (few could ever appreci-
ate the exertion of wearing as much ice
as Gucci). So what makes him different
from every other money-flashing, sexist,
Lamborghini-driving rapper on parole?
It's simple. In an age when hip hop
can only chart on the radio if it's bur-
ied under cheap pop schematics, when
the actual rapping is snuck in between
bombastic cookie-cutter choruses
(cough, B.o.B., cough), Gucci Mane is a
breath of fresh air. His flow is dripping
with charisma and his songs have more
character in one verse than all the top
10 singles on iTunes combined.
Gucci can turn from goofy self-dep-
recation ("Weirdo") to spitting street-
heavy rap more gracefully than almost
any other rapper today. For those peo-
ple who judge rap by how cool it makes
them feel while driving their ride (and
make no mistake, there are many of
them), when blasted loud enough, "Trap
Talk" could make even a Prius-driving
soccer mom feel gangsta.

Some members of Hanson were more receptive to performing a song called "MMMBop" than others.
Love vs. organ harvesting

'Never Let Me Go' hopes
strong acting will save its
unconvincing backdrop
By STEPHEN OSTROWSKI
For the Daily
With the eponymous silver-screen adap-
tation of KazuoIshiguro's 2005 novel, Mark
Romanek ("One Hour Photo") teases his
audience with a picture of
love, death and the ways
we skirt around both - a
picture elegant in its aes- Never Let
thetic crafting but plod-
ding and unrefined in its Me Go
thematic execution. At the
A brilliant trio of young Michigan
actors - Carey Mulligan Fox Searchlight
("An Education"), Andrew
Garfield ("The Social Net-
work") and Keira Knightley ("Pirates of the
Caribbean" series) - star as Kathy, Tommy
and Ruth, respectively. They are alumni of
Hailsham, an exclusive British prep school
where students are groomed as "donors":
individuals genetically engineered to sur-
vive multiple organ donations before dying,
or as is the donor vernacular, "completing."
(This medical achievement, prefaced with
the film's opening text, was realized in 1967

and allows life past 100years).
The film starts with Kathy reflecting on
her education at Hailsham, where she pain-
fully played third wheel to best friends'
Ruth and Tommy's puppy-love romance.
Kathy has long had misty-eyes for Tommy,
but the domineering Ruth effectively
squelches that fantasy.
The film then quickly shifts in time, to
when the three friends have graduated
Hailsham and been shuttled to The Cot-
tages, a pre-donation pastoral community.
As they face "completion," Ruth, Kathy and
Tommy seek to prove the popularly-prop-
agated rumor that Hailsham students can
defer donations if they can show they're in
"verifiable" love.
The film's most noteworthy feature
is the performances of the cast: Knight-
ley is almost unrecognizable as a woman
weathered by her donations and scarred by
subtle self-loathing and regret. Mulligan
and Garfield prove compatible, believable
romantics, with Kathy's level-headedness
a soothing complement to Tommy's disen-
chantment with the world.
With its dampened color palette and a
moving score, the film perfectly captures
the hopelessness to which the characters
are relegated. Long shots feature repeat-
ing structures - bridge trestles, apartment
windows and milk bottles - tastefully
alluding to the inescapable order inherent

to a Hailsham student's life.
But beyond the visuals and its actors,
there's nothing too convincing about
Romanek's universe. Glaringly absent is a
credible backdrop: apart from the charac-
ters wearing electronic bracelets that serve
as tracking devices, little indicates the
extent to which the characters are guinea
pig outsiders to a hellish world. The medi-
cal experiments seem all too human, mak-
ing sympathy difficult to find for their lot
and the narrative less compelling.
Moral reservations about this type of
world certainly abound, but do not receive
any significant treatment. The film does
not deem important any exploration or
explanation of its moral implications -
instead, the magnetic personal relation-
ships, which make life desirable for the
characters, are the film's focus. Romanek
discards a potentially engaging story about
the incongruent balance between societal
"progress" and basic human desire in favor
of the love triangle between Kathy, Tommy
and Ruth. The film never fully articulates
the horrors of Hailsham and boils down to
a tired formula of desiring an unattainable
love.
Omnipresent in "Never Let Me Go" is the
aforementioned label for a donor's death -
to "complete." But though visually engag-
ing and well-acted, the film never quite
achieves that goal.

Cincinnati, revisited

On a scale from one to cultured, Belle and Sebastian is elitist.
.Belle' sadequate'Love'

The latest from Belle
and Sebastain is perfect
for coffee-house music
By CASSIE BALFOUR
For theDaily
Belle and Sebastian's latest album
Write About Love is a perfectly adequate
addition to the Scottish
twee band's extensive *
collection - and noth-
ing more. Much of the eIIe and
album is extraordinari-
ly pedestrian and even SebaStian
conservative. Basically, Write About
it's coffee shop music: Love
inoffensive, unobtru-
sive sounds that tend Rough Trade
to blend into the back-
ground and never manage to wheedle
themselves into the conversation.
The band's career has been marked by
glowing reviews, which makes its latest
passable-but-lukewarm album even more
disappointing. Write about Love is less
homemade than previous records like
The Boy with the Arab Strap, with slick
production and some big-name guest
stars like the middling Norah Jones.
There are a few fresh sounding songs,
including the airy "I Didn't See It Com-
ing" which features charming synth
beats and vocals from the vintage-

sounding Sarah Martin (Tigermilk, If
You're Feeling Sinister). On the track,
Martin croons about love without frills:
"We don't have the money, money makes
the wheels and the world go round /
Forget about it, honey / Trouble's never
far away when you're around." Veteran
singer Stuart Murdoch stays firmly in
the background while Martin's voice
echoes dreamily throughout the open-
ing track. But some of the best tracks
on the album are the ones indulgently
steeped in synthy pop and catchy hooks
- namely "Come on Sister" and "Sun-
day's Pretty Icons."
The retro title track "Write About
Love" is the highlight and a breath of
fresh air. Cheeky lyrics implore listen-
ers to "Write about love / It could be
in any tense / But it must make sense."
This bouncy, electronic-infused track
features some sharp guitar and Carey
Mulligan's sepia-tinted voice singing
about the modern discontent that comes
standard with a 9-to-5 job.
Another standout track is the horn-
laden, fast-paced "I Want The World
To Stop." Complete with a sexy, slight-
ly ominous bass and periodic well
timed clapping, this track seems less
restrained and is actually fun - some-
thing sorely lacking in the rest of Write
About Love.
The album isn't as evocative or
thought-provoking as previous works
(think If You're Feeling Sinister). Write

About Love is lazy and formulaic Belle
and Sebastian. Pseudo pop music and
lyrics tackle subjects like unrequited
love and religion without anything
innovative or engaging. This makes a lot
of the songs blend together, feeling like a
rehash of the band's work.
It gets to the point where some of
the album simply acts as a more pleas-
ant version of white noise. "Little Lou,
Ugly Jack, Prophet John" is a track
you'll have to resist not fast-forwarding
through out of boredom. Norah Jones,
with her grudgingly admirable voice
but insufferably dull music, guests on
the song, which secures its spot among
Write About Love's most disappointing
tracks as Jones and Murdoch sing back
and forth at each other at an agonizingly
slow pace. The song's only positive fea-
ture is that you get to hear "Write About
Love" when it finally ends.
Belle and Sebastian stick to a well
worn formula for their latest album, and
for the most part it works adequately
well. WriteAboutLove is consistent with
the band's discography, but it doesn't
really do much to keep them relevant or
cutting edge. One can't help but remem-
ber Belle and Sebastian's classic song "If
You're Feeling Sinister," in which they
sing, "It's bound to be less boring than
today / It's bound to be less boring than
tomorrow." If only the same couldn't be
said for Belle and Sebastian's new duller
directions.

ast week, my professor for Muse-
ums and Society surprised the class
by deviating from the syllabus.
Instead of discussing what distinguishes
museums from other
cultural institutions, he
launched into a SO-min- '
ute story about his sum-
mer trip to Cincinnati to "
experience part of the
city's museum culture.
As a native Cincinnatian
(yeah, I know, boo Ohio,
we suck), I was super LEAH
surprised. Was this real BURGIN
life?
I love the museums
in Cincinnati. I love the suspended delicate
glass Chihuly sculpture that greets me
every time I walk through the huge doors
of the Cincinnati Art Museum. I love the
giant art-deco rotunda of the Cincinnati
Museum Center and its Museum of Science
and Natural History's recreated cave, full of
stalactites, stalagmites and live bats. I love
Cincinnati's sole Rembrandt portraitthat
hangs in the Taft Museum of Art, for which
my mom is a docent.
I also have loved my visits to the Contem-
porary Art Museum (especially its "Unmu-
seum," or mini children's museum on the

technically in Kentucky, but shhh - let's
pretend I don't live 30 minutes north of the
Mason-Dixon line).
I spent a large part of my childhood visit-
ing these museums with school groups and
my family. Some of my most vivid memories
come from these institutions. I remember
having my mind blown by the BODIES
exhibit at the Museum Center. I remember
pretending I was on an African safari dur-
ing the jungle walk at the zoo. I remember
being terrified of the Egyptian mummy at
the Art Museum.
These museums are familiar and impor-
tant to me. They helped to define my
childhood and my current interests. And
it was fascinating to consider them from
an "outsider's" perspective. My professor
had never been to the Cincinnati museums
before and, as a scholar of museums, I
believe he had a positive experience at all

the museums he visited.
What surprised me most, however, were
the two museums that dominated my pro-
fessor's story. The first was theCreation
Museum. Iam sad to say that this museum,
which claims to bring "the pages of the
Bible to life," touts the creationist creed
and includes dioramas of humans and
dinosaurs co-existing, is still considered
Cincinnati-based even though it's techni-
cally located in Kentucky. I have never
been.
The second was a private collection of
magic-Chemed paraphernalia. Collected for
more than 30 years by Ken Klosterman,
a Cincinnati businessman, this "Salon de
Magie" is considered by magic enthusiasts
one of the most comprehensive collections
of artifacts from the history of magic. My
professor spent most of his 50 minutes
discussingthe experience of touring this
collection, which seemed to be quite excit-
ing. The tour, which lasted more than eight
hours, included many illusions and demon-
strations.
This collection is 20 minutes from my
house. Once again, I've never been.
For all of my Cincinnati museum expe-
rience, it was fascinating to me that such
an amazing collection existed so close to
me for so long, and I didn't even know it.
Magic is not necessarily my passion, but
I would never pass up the opportunity
to tour such a world-class collection. (As
for the Creation Museum, I'm still on the
fence as to whether I want to give money
to such an institution. We'll see if curiosity
wins in the end.)
My professor's story was poignant for
me: It reminded me that Cincinnati, which
I often bash as backward and boring, still
has a lot to offer me. I haven't seen it all.
I could probably live in the city my entire
life (please God, no) and I still wouldn't
discover all of Cincinnati's lesser-known
cultural sites. His story was also a bit of a
wake-up call. I've always considered Cin-
cinnati sub-par to many of the other cities
I've been fortunate enough to visit. New
York City comes to mind, as do Portland,
San Francisco and Ann Arbor. But this is
really snobbish of me. Yeah, Cincinnati is
not necessarily the most cosmopolitan city,
but it's the only hometown I have. And I
need to respect that.
So: Dear Cincinnati, please accept my
apology for being mean to you my entire
life. I really do love you deep down. Sin-
cerely, Leah.
Also, Dear Mr. Klosterman, may I please
come tour your magic museum?
Also, Dear Creation Museum, please
stop existing.

SAM WOLSON/Daily
Redshirtsophomore cornerbackJ.T. Floyd makes a tackle in the Wolverines' 34-17 loss to the Spartans on Saturday.
Rodriguez speaks on
struggling secondary

Senior setter Lexi Zimmerman holds the school record for assists in a career.

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
When senior cornerback James
Rogers left Saturday's game in
the third quar-
ter with cramps, NOTEBOOK
true freshman
cornerback Cullen Christian
replaced him and lined up across
from Spartan senior wideout Mark
Dell.
Soon after Christian took the
field, Michigan State quarter-
back Kirk Cousins challenged the
freshman in a big way, as he loft-
ed a 41-yard ball to Dell, who left
Christian in his dust.
With the Wolverines' secondary
as young as it is this season, plays
like Cousins' deep-ball touchdown
to Dell have become standard
for a Michigan pass defense that
ranks 119th out of 120 teams in the
NCAA.
"Most coaches will tell you that
most true freshmen who play are
either so talented that you had to
get them on the field some way or
they're talented enough because
you have to play them because
your depth is what it is," Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez said
at his Monday press conference.
"They're talented enough to play,
but they're playing at positions
that not many true freshmen play
to the extent that they're playing."
Along with Christian, true
freshmen Terrence Talbott and
Courtney Avery have played sig-
nificant time at corner, while lead-
ership roles have been left to senior
James Rogers - a wide receiver
convert this offseason - and red-
shirt sophomore J.T. Floyd, who
has started in just seven games in
his career.

econdary, (freshman spur) he'll be back after the bye week.

Lexi Zimmerman, Setter (Volleyball)
U Yes, you read that correctly. After throwing three interceptions in Saturday's loss to Michigan
State, Denard Robinson is no longer No. 1. But by no means did Zimmerman earn the spot by default.
She posted her second-ever triple-double with 43 assists, 13 kills and 13 digs in a statement win over
No. 6 Illinois on Saturday. Those would be some video game-like numbers if volleyball video games
existed. The victory vaulted the 15th-ranked Wolverines into a tie for first atop the Big Ten standings.
2 Denard Robinson, Quarterback (Football)
Michigan fans could barely make it out of their own sections without hearing an inevitable
onslaught of questions. Is the Heisman hype too much for Denard? Is this what we should come
to expect against legitimate Big Ten defenses? Has he been exposed as an inadequate passer? And
should hefinally start tying his shoes? Probably not. And he's still at the forefront of the Heisman con-
versation. But clearly, all three of the Spartan picks were costly and resulted from bad decision-mak-
ing. And if the Wolverines couple the loss to Michigan State with another one to Iowa this weekend
- just as they did last season - Michigan fans will have to wonder whether they're back at square one.
Louie Caporusso, Forward (Ice Hockey)
* As Caporusso goes, so go the Wolverines. Last year, the early-season Hobey Baker contender was ice
cold to start, and Michigan had one of its worst starts ever under Red Berenson. This season, Caporusso
has two goals and four assists in the first three games and Michigan is 2-0-1. Granted, the two wins
came last weekend over Bowling Green, a team that typically finishes in the CCHA cellar. But if Capo-
russo keeps up this torrid pace, the Wolverines will find the types of results they found atthe end of last
season, when they nearly reached the Frozen Four.
4Alex Hunt, Outside Hitter (Volleyball)
For every triple-double Zimmerman puts up and every Michigan record she breaks, there is yet
another solid performance by Hunt. Last weekend was no different, as she led the Wolverines in kills
in Friday's 3-0 victory over Wisconsin and the aforementioned win over the Fighting Illini. She is now
ranked 15th in the nation in kills per set. At that rate, she may just have a Michigan record of her own
one day.
Lion Kim (Men's Golf)
* After a brief hiatus, Kim is back in the rankings at No. 5 with his fifth-place finish at the Rod Myers
Invitational on Monday. With the accolades he has compiled in the last few months, Kim almost made
the list last week without even playing a round of golf. His latest performance - fueledby a three-undet
69 in the second round - was his second top-five finish in the last three weeks. He won the Windott
Memorial Classic on Sept. 27 after nailing a 45-putt on the 18th hole. And most notably, he's earned a
spot in next April's Masters.
6Denise Muresan (Women's Tennis)
Muresan was the star of the Michigan tennis program at last week's ITA All-American Champion-
ships, reaching the semifinals before fallingto the second-ranked player in the nation. Her run included
three wins over top-25 players, taking two of the victories in straight sets. She entered the tournament
as the nation's 12th-ranked player. But after being one of the last four standing, she will be moving up at
least a couple of spots.
7 Justin Meram, Forward (Men's Soccer)
E No Saad brothers? No problem. In last Wednesday's victory over Cincinnati, Meram scored his sec-
ond game-winning goal in as many games without Hamoody or Soony on the field. Hamoody was side-
lined due to a knee injury and Soony was held out because of a red card in the previous game. Meram
then extended his goal-scoring streak to three games with a goal in Sunday's tightly contested 3-2 win
against Wisconsin.
8Rachael Mack, Forward (Field Hockey)
The field hockey team is getting contributions from all over the field. Three players have earned
spots on this list in the last three weeks. On Monday, Mack earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week
honors for the third time this season after scoringtwice and adding an assist in Friday's 4-3 overtime
win over Miami (Ohio). Her second score decided the game with just 55 seconds remaining in over-
time. Following two wins on the weekend, the team has won nine of its last 10 games.
9 Jon Merrill, Defenseman (Ice Hockey)
For the past couple of seasons, Michigan has had trouble finding goal scoring from its back line. But
through the season's first three games, the Wolverines may have found a defenseman who can find the
scoring touch. Merrill has had an impressive start to his freshman season, with a goal and an assist in
Saturday's win over Bowling Green. His four points are second on the team to Caporusso so far.
1 Jason Jung and Evan King, Doubles (Men's Tennis)
= Jung and King squeak into the rankings after performing well in the doubles portion of the
ITA All-American Championships. Their run ended in the quarterfinals of the main draw, but they did
knock off UCLA's fifth-ranked duo. Neither fared well in singles play though, as Jung lost in the first-
round of the main draw and King lost in qualifyingto the nation's third-ranked player.

In the first round on Sunday,
Kim was not alone at the top of
the leaderboard for Michigan.
Junior Matt Thompson, sopho-
more Jack Schultz, sophomore
Rahul Bakshi and freshman Joey
Garber all posted scores under
par, propelling the Wolverines
into a second-place ranking, five
strokes behind Iowa.
But Michigan could not keep
its momentum going into the sec-
ond round on Sunday, as Thomp-
son, Garber and Bakshi all were
plagued by costly double-bogeys.
Kim was the only Wolverine
under par and Michigan ended
the round with a five-over 293.
"We had to count a 78 (in the
second round)," Sapp said. "On a
golf course like this and against
teams that are playing well, if
you're counting a six-over par as
one of your top four scores dur-
ing the round, that's going to hurt
you."
Despite the less-than-stellar
second round, the Wolverines
were still only 12 total strokes
behind first-place Iowa. And a
notable final round would have
given Michigan a chance at the
title.
But the 12-stroke deficit turned
out to be too steep of a hill to
climb, as the Hawkeyes ran away
with the title with a tournament
total of 13-under 851- five strokes
ahead of second-place North Car-
olina State and 10 strokes ahead of
the fourth-placeWolverines.
"We wanted to come out and
shoot a good score and make the
leaders catch us," Sapp said. "We
played better than pretty much
everybody in the field in the final
round, but (Sunday) really hurt
us. We needed the leaders to give
us a little more help today."
Though Michigan didn't come
away with the victory, the Wol-
verines had a positive tournament
overall.
Each player in the starting
lineup posted at least one round
under par, and-that will without
doubt give the team confidence it
heads into the final two weeks of
the fall season.
"We competed to win this
week," Sapp said. "We came up
short, but we beat a lot of good
teams in this field. We want to
keep moving up and keep getting
more trophies in the next couple
of weeks."

CCHA CONTENDERS

Notre Dame
After a dismal 9-12-7 in-
conference record last season,
the Fighting Irish could easily
be the biggest dark-horse con-
tender this winter. Since Notre
Dame coach Jeff Jackson took
the reins five years ago, the team
has won the CCHA regular sea-
son and tournamenttitles twice,
made three trips to the NCAA
Tournament and advanced to
Notre Dame's first Frozen Four
appearance in 2008. With a
wealth of young players - 12
freshmen compared to five
seniors - Jackson wants to put
last seasonbehind him.
Nobody on the team cracked
the top 20 scorers in the CCHA
last season, but through just two
games so far, sophomore Nick
Larson and freshman Anders
Lee have both netted three
goals.
As the primary goalie last
year, Johnson posted a 2.50
goals against average, but with
Summerhays pacing him this
season, count on Notre Dame to
have some great defensive play.

Miami (Ohio)
After the RedHawks lost 3-2
to Boston University in the 2009
Frozen Four final, they held a
top-five ranking all of last sea-
son.
Miami coasted to a 21-2-5
CCHA record, took third in the
conference tournament and beat
Michigan to reach the Frozen
Four. Even after a 7-1 drubbing
at the hands of Boston College
in the semifinals of the tourna-
ment this spring, the RedHawks
enter as perhapsthe frontrunner
to capture the CCHA title. This
season, No. 4 Miami returns
the goalies that led them nearly
untouched through last sea-
son, juniors Cody Reichard and
Conner Knapp. Reichard - the
CCHA Player ofthe Year - post-
ed an unbeaten 15-0-2 record.
With two of the conference's
top eight scorers back on the
ice for the RedHawks this year,
don't expect them to go any-
where in the CCHA standings.
They will be a force atop the
conference and on the national
scene.

Alaska Fairbanks
After several inauspicious
years of CCHA play, No.14 Alas-
ka is perhaps the most up-and-
coming program. Despite the
disadvantage of having to travel
over six hours to play nearly
every opponent, the Nanooks
are becoming a formidable
power, posting a fifth-place fin-
ish in the conference last season.
With only five seniors return-
ing, the Nanooks are still a very
young team, but they retained
most of their young talent -
the skilled players who led
them to success in the regular
season last year. Junior goal-
tender Scott Greenham is back
between the pipes again, after
posting an admirable 2.34 goals
against average in 28 starts last
season.
A year ago, then-freshman
Andy Toranto lit up the opposi-
tion, finishing fifth in the points
race and receiving the CCHA
Rookie of the Year award. With
Toranto returning for a second
year, expect him to produce
even more.

Ferris State
Even after losing leading
scorer Blair Riley, Ferris State,
which finished third in the
CCHA last year, is returning
most of its 2009 roster and
has added a few key compo-
nents. Coach Bob Daniels, in
his 18th year at the helm in Big
Rapids, is working to lead his
team back to the NCAA tour-
nament for the second time in
program history.
With goaltenders Pat Nagle
and Taylor Nelson back again,
expect Daniels to keep the two
goalies, who combined for a
21-13-6 record last year, mov-
ing in and out of the Bulldogs'
net.
In the opening series
against Alabama-Huntsville
last weekend, Nagle picked up
his first victory in 4-1 fashion.
But Nelson was roughed up for
four goals the next night.
Don't be surprised to see
Ferris State knock off a few
quality opponents this season
and make a run at the confer-
ence title.

Northern Michigan
The Wildcats have some huge
holes to fill this season. After
finishing with a 13-9-6 CCHA
record, good for fourth place in
the conference, this season is
make-or-break. Forward Mark
Oliver was the points leader in the
conference (35), and goalie Brian
Steward racked up 12 wins and
three shutouts. But both of those
players, along with CCHA Player
of the Year finalist Erik Gustafs-
son, graduated in the spring,
leavingtheunderachievingWild-
cats with many questions left to
answer
But don't expect them to lie
down and let older, more experi-
enced teams skate all over them.
Last year Northern Michigan
came into Yost and thrashed
Michigan 3-1 in their first meet-
ing. The Wildcat offensive attack
includes Swedish forward Gregor
Hanson - seventh in points last
year (29) - and freshman for-
ward Erik Higby, who tallied a
hat trick the first time he hit the
ice this season. defenses will be
able to contend with this season.

ultimately fell one game short of the
Frozen Four in a double-overtime lossN
to Miami in the NCAA Tournament,
no Michigan hockey fan can deny that
Hunwick's play got them there - espe-
cially in the absence of top defenseman
Chris Summers, who went down with
an injury in the CCHA tournament.
No one could've predicted Hogan's G y
injury, but niu one could've predicted
the way the team would respond ins
front of Hunwick, either. There is a
tangible team chemistry when Hun-a
wick is in the net - memories of the
improbable postseason run mix withR
the bitter taste of an unrewarding exit.
Early this season, Berenson is using
a goalie-by-committee method, wheret
Hogan and Hunwick swap starts each
series.
But a point will soon come when
Michigan is going to have to pick its
gy, the guy who will lead the Wolver-
ines back to the NCAATournament -
and to a national title this time.
While Hogan is more seasoned ink
the net, it is Shawn Hunwick who
deserves the chance to be the it guy for
2010. There is no denying the team's
chemistry when Hunwick stands
between the pipes, and he has earned
the chance to prove he still has the
magic to get this team back to the post-
season.

not one puck had crossed the goal
line. The Wolverines, who were
clutch in front of Hunwick last
season, failed to capitalize on their
chances the year prior.
A year and half later, two Michi-
gao goalies are again competing
for the job, which bodes well for
Hogan. Remember, in a much-talk-
ed-about competition with Sauer,
Hogan won out, so maybe all Hogan
needs is just a little healthy battle to
bring out the best in him.
Although many critics would say
he didn't play close to his potential
last year, the front-five on the ice
with him at any given time weren't
usually up to par for most of the
season. ,
Hogan's proven he can win -
there's no question about that. The
Wolverines have shown they can
put it all together in front him, and
now, it's just a matter of combining
Hogan circa 2008 with last season's
down-the-stretch Michigan squad,
and maybe, just maybe, Berenson
will win something he hasn't in
more than a decade.
I can hear the doubters already.

STAYING POWER
From Page 5B
was something like, 'Look how fun
this place is, look how great it could
be. Look at the opportunities you
have and look at the chance you have
to succeed here at the University
of Michigan.' After (you're) given
so much, you want to give so much
back."
After a slow start his junior year,
Caporusso finished the season just
six points shy of his sophomore total.
Rust and Hagelin had a quieter
route to this meeting. Rust "took a
back seat," not talking much with the
Blue Jackets, who earned his rights
in a trade, while Hagelin, a seventh-
round pick with the Rangers, told
them early on he was staying four
years.
That contact with New York didn't
change after he blew up last season,
leading the team in scoring.
They all found their way to this
moment, but why?
Rust, a fourth-round pick, laughs
when he talks about how his team-
mates get on him for taking school
too seriously.
"He takes school way too serious-
ly," Caporusso jokes. "He spends the
most hours in the library, 70 percent
looking for girls, 30 percent study-
ing."
For these players hockey is the

focus, but getting a good education is
the goal.
"For me, that's pretty much the
only reason I came here," Hagelin
says. "Back (in Sweden) we don't
have college sports so I had the deci-
sion of playing hockey or just stop
playing hockey and get a degree.
But then this chance came up, so for
me, coming here was a no-brainer to
stay all four years and get a degree
because school is so important.
"Getting that degree is something
we all want and that's a reason we're
staying here for the fourth year."
In an era without compromises
like Berenson's with the Canadiens,
the motivation for school often
becomes a major part of any player's
decision. often it is the player facili-
tating the early departure time.
"I think it's a two way street with
that," Caporusso said. "A lot of the
time I think it's the player forcing the
team to come up with some contract
a lot of the time because they want to
get out of school."
The trio had planned to stay all
four years.
As much as the plan was for aca-
demics, it was also for hockey devel-
opment.
Hagelin and Rust even admitted
they didn't think they had a chance to
leave early. Even as NHL draft picks,
all three needed the college game to
develop.

"You just don't develop in one year
and then you're gone because of your
statistics," Berenson said.
But one year's development is all
that remains. A year from now all
three will be fighting for an NHL
spot. Whether Hagelin and Rust may
have sold themselves a little short
remains to be seen. The speed, the
intangibles, the leadership - it's
there.
"You want to see players that can
make plays at full speed," Dave Star-
man, CBS College Sports commenta-
tor and amateur scout for the Toronto
Maple leafs said. "To me, Matt.Rust
can make a play at top speed. Louie
Caporusso can make a play at top
speed. Carl Hagelin can make a play
at top speed. These are three guys
that are great college players and
the fact that they are sticking it out
and playing their fourth year is only
going to enhance their pro capabili-
ties."
There's also a more sobering real-
ity. NHL teams only have one or
two new forward spots per season.
Nothing is guaranteed, especially for
middle-to-late round picks like them.
They've seen more highly regarded
classmates leave early.
Max Pacioretty, a first-round pick
in 2007, left after his freshman year.
He's had some success, playing-in 86
NHL games; but he started this sea-
son in the AHL. Palushaj left a year
later and has yet to play in an NHL

game.
It's a reason for finishing their
education: a Plan B when no one
knows what Plan A is quite yet.
"It is scary for us," Rust said.
"That's not a reason why I'm staying,
but at the end of my four years here,
it's going to be intimidating to real-
ize you're fighting for a spot on the
roster. Obviously here we're playing
for a spot on Michigan's team, but
they're stuck with us in essence. It's
not a job yet. When you make it to the
next level, you're definitely expend-
able."
Together they came in. Together
they will lead the Wolverines - both
on the score sheet and in the locker
room.
Due to some early departures
Hagelin, Caporusso and Rust's
recruiting class was able include 12
members. Now the class is down to
nine, but Hagelin, Caporusso, and
Rust as captains (along with junior
Luke Glendening) are in charge
of this team largely because they
returned for their senior season.
They are also expected to reprise
their scoring roles from last year.
Being relied on for both leader-
ship and huge numbers to begin the
season is a new role for the trio. It's
the next step in their development as
hockey players, their final go-round
in the collegiate game. Like Porter
in their freshman year and Berenson

nearly fifty years prior, if the Wol-
verines are to compete for a national
title, they need to do what Berenson
expects every year - that their senior
years are their best year.
"You're wearing a letter on your
jersey so you know you've got the
responsibility of being a leader and
not just trying to be a leader as an
underclassman, so I think that's part
of it," Berenson said. "The other part
is this is their year. This is their last
year and there's no next year to worry
about. It's this year and they've really
got to embrace that."
For the three, having their best
combined year means scoring more
than 35 percent of Michigan's goals.
But it's more than just individual
development.
It's more than winning Hobey
Bakers or setting scoring records. It's
not even about doing what Berenson
and Porter did. It's about doing what
Berenson and Porter couldn't: win a
national title.
"I think the biggest thing me
and Carl can do, and Rust, is bring
a national championship here to the
University of Michigan again and
win one for coach Berenson and the
coaching staff," Caporusso said.
Wherever the third-ranked Wol-
verines finish at the end of the sea-
son, Berenson can look back at his
three senior captains and know they
were here for the right reasons. Why?
Because they stayed.

know that Bryan Hogan
was recruited to be the
starting goalie at Michi-
gan. I understand that Hogan
has played 3,604 minutes more
in Michi-
gan's net
than Shawn
Hunwick
has. Ieven
recognize
that Hogan
won the
starting job CASANDRA
from then- PAGNI
senior Billy
Sauer - as
a sophomore.
But in hockey, you have to go
with the hot goalie.
The tough question for Red
Berenson and the Wolver-
ines: does Hunwick's success
transfer from one season to the
next?
In Hunwick's case, he
deserves the chance to show
that he can be the lights-out
goalie of last season's playoff
run.
If Hogan hadn't suffered a
groin injury in the first period
of last year's final regular sea-
son series against Notre Dame,
then there's a good, maybe
even great chance that there
would be no debate today over
who Berenson's No.1I netmind-
er should be this season.
But then again, if Hogan had
stayed healthy, would Michi-
gan have upset conference
rivals then-No.11 Michigan
State and then-No. 2 Miami
(Ohio) to win the CCHA Tour-
nament and secure a place in
the NCAA Tournament for the
20th straight year, after com-
ing dangerously close to break-
ing that streak?
While it's a mere game of
speculation, I'd prefer to stick
the facts. The fact is that Hun-
wick's incredible postseason
performance was a huge rea-
son Michigan found itself back
into NCAA contention and
one game away from the Fro-
zen Four, despite the fact that
Hunwick has played 60 fewer
games in his collegiate career
than Hogan.

When Hogan went down,
the Wolverines held a medio-
cre 14-12-0 CCHA record. The
team had just dropped four of
its previous six games and was
staring at the all-too-real pos-
sibility of staying home for the
NCAA postseason if the team
didn't make an incredibly deep
run into the CCHA tourna-
ment.
Michigan was picked to
finish first in the CCHA by
the coaches and media poll
prior to the season, but when
the regular season ended, the
Wolverines in front of Hogan
had played themselves to a
seventh-place conference fin-
ish. Michigan hadn't finished
seventh in the conference
since 1986-7, making last year's
finish a tie for the program's
worst.
Ten minutes into the first
period on Feb. 25 with the Wol-
verines locked in a 0-0 tie with
Notre Dame, Shawn Hunwick
- dubbed "the short goalie" by
Berenson, standing four inches
shorter than Hogan -skated
out to the net, unaware of the
extent of Hogan's injury or the
magnitude of his opportunity.
Before his injury, the team
played 34 of 35 games with
Hogan in the net.
But Hunwick didn't just fill
space in Hogan's absence, he

had a transformation of sorts,
reverting back to the Beren-

Don'tget me wrong, Hun-
wick played solid in net over
that 10-game stretch. He made
some key stops along the way,
but he never stole a game for
the Wolverines.
Call me pessimistic, a
buzzkill, whatever you want.
It's just a fact that this team,
which has underperformed as
of late, is ready for Hogan to
right the ship, grab the start-
ing job and lead Michigan to
contend for its first title in
more than a decade.
Anyone claiming that Hun-
wick should man the pipes
based on the team's transfor-
mative performance in front
of him is clearly misguided.
The Wolverines have played
extremely well in front of
Hogan already, and anyone
saying the team plays harder
for Hunwick is just, simply,
wrong.
Throughout his sophomore
campaign, thoughts of Hogan
possibly mirroring legendary
goaltender Marty Turco (yes,
I said it) quietly surfaced.
But leave it to a first-round
upset at the hands of Air Force
that same season to immedi-
ately stifle those beliefs. And
that's where everyone seems
to lose sight of Hogan ever
leading Michigan back to the
Frozen Four or even just hold-
ing down the No.1 spot.
A 2-0 loss. Eleven saves.
Against the 16th-ranked and
last place Falcons.
For the ignorant onlooker,
the common response is some-
thing along the lines of, "How
could a goaltender allow two
goals on such few shots to
such a lowly-seeded team like
Air Force? Surely, the loss is
Hogan's, right?"
Well, if my memory serves
me right, you can't win if you
don't score, and after Michigan

The phone calls. The promises. The threats. The
Montreal Canadiens had used them alL.
They wanted the kid wearing Michigan hockey's
No. 9 sweater to sign a pro contract. But he wanted
to stay in school - to get his degree. The Canadiens
didn't want to wait. They called the kid after his freshman sea-
son, trying to sign him to a contract. He said no. Asa sophomore,
the result was the same.
No. 9 went on to become an All-American his junior year. And
Montreal came calling again. The response was always the same.
He told the Canadiens he wasn't going to leave Michigan. He
wasn't going to leave his classmate. He wasn't going to leave his
team and he wasn't going to leave his school.
The Canadiens didn't just resort to phone calls though. Mon-
treal realized the talented center's thirst for education during his
time at Michigan. They also realized it wasn't going away. Even-
tually, theybrought him to the foot of Mount Royal in downtown
Montreal - the site of McGill University. The Canadiens had
thought of a compromise.
Sign with them, play a grueling NHL schedule and get your
degree at McGill at the same time. It may be an unconvention-
al strategy for an NHL team in today's terms, but this was the
1960's. So the young hockey standout had a meeting with the
Dean of McGill's Engineering School.
The Dean only reinforced his original decision.
"He said 'Son, you can't go to school,'- engineering school,
can you imagine that? - 'And play pro hockey in the NHL and
miss days and weeks,"' the not-so young anymore says today.
The Dean's next thought may have been the most important.
"Besides, Michigan's got a better engineering school than we
do, so stay at Michigan."
More than 40 years before he would lead the Wolverines into
the 2010-11 season as Michigan's coach, Red Berenson's decision
didn't waver.
"I was reinforced everywhere I looked," Berenson said. "The
right thing to do was stay in school."
And Berenson reaped the benefits. In his final year donning
the maize-and-blue, he scored 43 goals (still a Michigan record)
and 70 points in just 28 games. The year ended with a third-place
finish at the NCAA Championships.
The night after the season ended, Berenson finally signed
with Montreal and began what would be a 17-year NHL career,
which included a Stanley Cup.
Long before leaving early for the NHL was a common practice
in college hockey, Red Berenson stayed.
Kevin Porter had to talk to his coach.
After being drafted in the fifth round by the Phoenix Coyotes,
the Michigan forward had blossomed into a prolific scorer in his
three years in Ann Arbor. Phoenix offered him a pro contract
after his sophomore year and he turned it down. After leading
the team in scoring his junior season, the Coyotes came back and
made another offer.
This year was a bit different though. Then-sophomore Jack
Johnson left soon after Michigan's loss to North Dakota in the
NCAA Tournament. And Andrew Cogliano, who Porter out-
scored the past season, jumped directly into an NHL lineup.

Today Porter says he wasn't seriously considering leaving, he just
wanted to run it by Berenson.
"He wasn't too happy about it," Porter said. "He sat down and
gave me some pros and cons and we talked about it and that was
it. I never told him, 'I'm leaning towards leaving,' or 'I'm leaning
towards staying,' I just wanted to get his input and talk with the
coaches about it and see what they thought and I did that."
The year may have been different, but the decision didn't
change. Porter returned to captain the Wolverines in his senior
season. Like Berenson, he reaped the rewards. Porter put up in
63 points in 43 games in his senior season, winning the Hobey
Baker Award. His team, consisting of just three seniors and 12
freshmen, ended one win away from the National Championship
Game.
Among that large class of freshmen were Carl Hagelin, Louie
Caporusso and Matt Rust. They were similar to Porter: middle-
to-late round draft picks who showed some promise at the col-
legiate level. They saw what Porter did.
When everybody else was leaving early, Kevin Porter stayed.
Three years later, Hagelin, Caporusso and Rust sit in the
Michigan coaches lounge before practice.
The top three scorers on the team during their junior seasons,
the trio followed in the footsteps of their coach and their team-
mate. The three returned for their final year, along with the rest
of their team. For the first time in 13 years, every non-senior on
Michigan's final roster came back.
Caporusso and Hagelin are sitting on couches with the
block 'M' emblazoned on them wearing their Michigan hockey
warmups. Hagelin's picture adorns the wall, and Caporusso and
Rust's pictures will join it soon. That wall is reserved for pictures
of the captains.
To the left is Brendan Morrison's Hobey Baker Award: a con-
stant reminder of just how much one can accomplish in a senior
year. To the right is a wall of pictures with all the former Wol-
verines who have played in the NHL, beginning with Berenson.
Second to last is Porter: a constant reminder of the ultimate
objective.
They're entrenched in this program, but they probably
shouldn't be here, sitting together.
Caporusso, from Woodbridge, Ontario, Hagelin, from Soder-
talje, Sweden, and Rust, from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, all
had other options when choosing colleges. Hagelin didn't have
to cross the Atlantic Ocean to continue his hockey career. And
each could have pushed their envelop with their professional
team early.
At a school where leaving for the NHL is common, how did
possibly the three candidates most likely to leave all decide to
return?
Caporusso had the best opportunity of the three. After his
sophomore, year he was a Hobey Baker finalist. His linemate that
season, Aaron Palushaj, left for the NHL that the summer. But
Caporusso, a third-round pick of the Ottawa Senators, kept the
course.
"I think it was more the opposite actually," Caporusso said. "It
