Speakers highlight 

importance of 
international 
relationship

By TIMOTHY COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Over the past weekend, the 

Ross School of Business hosted 
the seventh annual India Business 
Conference. The event featured 
panels of speakers from both 
the United States and India to 
talk about the changing business 
relationship between the two 
countries.

The 
speakers 
at 
the 

event 
included 
Natarajan 

Chandrasekaran, CEO of Tata 
Consultancy 
Services; 
Niren 

Chaudhary, the global president 
of KFC; and Yashwant Sinha, the 
former Minister of External Affairs 
and former Minister of Finance to 
India. Each event was moderated 
by a Ross faculty member who 
also oversaw question and answer 
sessions.

Business Prof. Guatam Ahuja, 

the conference organizer, said the 
conference was designed to cover 
a wide range of topics to inform 
current 
and 
future 
business 

leaders. It attracted a crowd of 
largely business students and local 
businesspeople.

MBA student Anand Markande, 

who was in attendance at the 
event, said this importance of 
emerging economies is reflected 
in the graduate curriculum at the 
Business School.

“Here, we have a lot of courses 

that have an emerging market 
theme,” Markande said. “This is 
especially true of India and China.”

On 
Friday, 
Chandrasekaran 

provided opening remarks to 
an audience of about 100 people 
at the Robertson Auditorium at 
the Ross School of Business. He 
spoke about executive leadership 
and the role of software, data, and 
communication in business.

“There 
are 
distinct 

characteristics 
of 
the 
recent 

economic development in India, 
which are making a revolution in 
business,” Chandrasekaran said.

Performances 

include various styles 

of classical Indian, 
Indofusion dance

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan 
Sahana 
hosted 

That 
Brown 
Show 
Saturday 

night at the Michigan Theater, 
featuring 
student 
performing 

groups focused on South Asian 
styles 
including 
Michigan 

Manzil, Maize Mirchi, Maya, 
the Michigan Bhangra Team, 
the Michigan Raas Team, TAAL, 
Izzat and Michigan Sahana.

The 
performances, 
which 

drew about 700 people, included 
classical Indian dances, singing 
and Indofusion, a mix of American 
and Indian styles.

Engineering 
senior 

Kavinmozhi Caldwell, a member 
of both Maya and Sahana, said 
Maya strives to combine other 

cultures into their routines. In 
past shows, Maya has performed 
Indochinese numbers and danced 
to African beats with drums, as 
well as incorporating their native 
dancing techniques.

“We try to connect with 

Hispanic, African-American and 
Chinese culture,” said Caldwell. 
“(Maya) takes Bharatanatyam, 
Kathak or other Indian classical 
dances and fuses it with ballet, 
jazz or salsa, for example.”

Engineering 
junior 
Shreya 

Raman attended the show to 

support her friends who were 
performing in various groups.

“My favorite was Izzat. There 

was a lot of energy overall, and 
it was great to experience the 
different styles of dance and 
music,” Raman said. “TBS brings 
together the different teams and 
provides a sense of belonging in 
the entire community.”

Many of the groups begin 

choreographing and rehearsing 
for 
the 
show

in 

advance. LSA sophomore Liam

student comedy groups Funny 
or Die University of Michigan, 
ComCo and Midnight Book 
Club hosted the first annual 
University 
Improv 
Festival 

Saturday 
at 
Rackham 

Auditorium.

Featuring a variety of improv 

comedy groups from Chicago, 
New York, University of Iowa, 
George Washington University 
and the University, organizers 
said the festival aimed to bring 
improv comedy to a wider 
audience.

LSA sophomore Kelsey Fox, 

a member of ComCo, said she 
hoped the event reached a 
large and diverse portion of the 
student body.

“We 
had 
multiple 

demographics that we were 
reaching out to,” Fox said. “I 
hope that the average Michigan 
student had a crazy fun time.”

The festival was divided 

into two parts — one show at 7 
p.m. and one at 9 p.m. Student 
group Funny or Die opened the 
first part with a sketch about 
the president of the United 
States debating with his staff 
about pre-emptively bombing 
countries while mispronouncing 
simple terms such as ‘tank’ and 
‘bulletproof,’ drawing a strong 
response from the crowd to kick 
off the show.

receSs, 
a 
student 
group 

from 
George 
Washington 

University, 
performed 
next, 

acting out several sketches 
including a reenactment of the 
Last Supper featuring a “Jersey 
Shore”-styled Jesus, a seminar 
on sexual misconduct in the 
workplace and a group of friends 
debating plans for high school 
graduation.

GWU senior Kevin Palermo, a 

member of receSs, said he enjoys 
improv comedy because of the 
excitement from performing it.

newMICH wins 
executive spots, 

but not majority of 
representative seats 

By JENNIFER MEER and 

TIMOTHY COHN

Daily Staff Reporters

LSA juniors David Schafer and 

Micah Griggs will be the 2016 
Central 
Student 
Government 

president and vice president, 
according to unofficial election 
results released early Saturday 
morning.

The results will not be made 

official until pending litigation 
is resolved. As of Friday night, 
four lawsuits were still pending, 
including several filed minutes 
before unofficial results were 
released.

The 
newMICH 
ticket 
of 

Schafer and Griggs defeated 
Public Policy junior Thomas 
Hislop, and LSA junior Cameron 
Dotson from the Your Michigan 
party by a margin of 59 votes, 
3,811 
votes 
to 
3,752. 
LSA 

senior Keysha Wall and LSA 
sophomore 
Chalse 
Okorom, 

the Defend Affirmative Action 
Party 
presidential 
candidate 

and vice presidential candidates, 

garnered 390 votes for third 
place.

Overall turnout was at roughly 

20 percent of the student body, 
a 2 percent decrease from last 
year’s record turnout. This is the 
second-closest vote margin over 
the past decade in CSG history, 
following last year’s five vote 
victory for Make Michigan.

newMICH ran on a platform of 

expanding student opportunities 
through mentorship programs, 
amplifying 
student 
voice 
in 

CSG, improving connection by 
instituting scholarships for low 
income students, and ensuring 
student well-being and safety 

School of Nursing 
uses mannequins 

that can bleed, sweat 

and give birth

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

At the University of Michigan 

School of Nursing, along with 
students, you’ll also find Donnie 
Philips — who appears to be a 
child with pneumonia. However, 
Philips is actually one of many 
robotic mannequins used to teach 
nursing students.

The current Nursing School 

building, opened last semester 
houses six simulation rooms — 
including two pediatrics rooms, 
two medical surgical rooms and 
two obstetrical rooms — in which 
mannequins like Philips are used 
for classroom exercises.

High-fidelity mannequins are 

operated through a sophisticated 
software 
program 
and 
have 

been in use at the University of 
Michigan since 2008, while low 
and 
mid-fidelity 
mannequins 

have been in use for much longer.

and 

Sexual Assault and Prevention 
Awareness Center services to

Campus. 
Additionally, 

they hope to place a student on 
the Board of Regents during 
their tenure in office, though it’s 
unclear whether the addition of a 
student is legal under Michigan’s 
constitution.

In remarks after the votes 

were released, Schafer said the 
first initiative the party aims to 
achieve would be Intergroup 
Relations training for all CSG 
representatives and Assembly 

members. He also noted the 
margin of victory for the party, 
calling it a powerful statement 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
both 

newMICH and Your Michigan. 

“We are just humbled, humbled 

that thousands of students have 
put their trust in us, and they 
believed in us, and I think that it 
can not go unnoticed that there are 
so many students who voted for 
the first time in a Central Student 
Government election during their 
tenure here at the University 
because they hoped and believed 
in what we had to say and what we 
stood for,” Schafer said. “We are 
excited to work with every single 
individual, of all parties.”

Overall, he said working closely 

with the University administration 

will be important going forward to 
achieve his administration’s goals. 
One piece of the party’s platform 
in particular — creating a student 
presence on the Board of Regents 
— 
promptedquestions 
about 

feasibility and legality in the lead-
up to the elections.

“I think it’s a matter of sitting 

down 
with 
the 
University 

administration and having these 
conversations about our ambitious 
ideas.” Schafer said. “I think 
it’s going to be about engaging 
students, 
and 
engaging 
the 

administration, and to work on 
achieving these goals, or at least 
paving the way for us to achieve 
these goals.”

Griggs also noted that it was 

important to work not only with 

the University administration, 
but also with the newly elected 
CSG representatives to push their 
upcoming agenda.

According to the unofficial 

results, 
Your 
Michigan 

representatives will outnumber 
newMICH 
representatives 

22 to 31 on the new assembly. 
However, Schafer said he does 
not foresee any difficulty with 
that balance.

“I think it’s just a matter 

of sitting down with Your 
Michigan, and everyone who 
supported 
Your 
Michigan 

and getting to know them and 
their communities better, and 
working with them and their 
communities,” 
Schafer 
said. 

“Understanding that we come 
from the same community, cut 
from the same cloth, and that 
as Michigan students we are 
all here for the same reasons, 
to better this campus and same 
community.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Anushka 

Sarkar, 
chief 
programming 

officer in CSG and newMICH 
campaign manager, said moving 
forward they plan to combine 
the efforts of both parties as 
they contain similar goals.

“I 
think 
that 
it’s 
also 

important to ensure that the 
issues that students supported 
that students who supported 
Your Michigan wanted to make 
progress on are not forgotten 
over the course of David and 
Micah’s administration,” Sarkar 
said. 

Jim Harbaugh won fourth place in the University of Michigan’s 2016 

executive Central Student Government election, the same standing he 
achieved in last year’s election, according to unofficial results released 
Saturday morning.

The name Jim Harbaugh, which could refer either to Michigan 

Football coach Jim Harbaugh or the coach’s son James Harbaugh, an 
LSA freshman, garnered 215 votes, exactly 100 votes over last year’s 
total. The Defend Affirmative Action Party garnered third place with 
390 votes.

After his fourth-place finish last year, Harbaugh the coach tweeted 

that he was “disappointed” with the results.

“Competitive juices flowing!,” the tweet read. “Hat in the ring for 

2016 & will campaign w/ #EUTM”

Harbaugh also won one of ten representative positions for the 

Rackham School of Graduate Studies on the assembly, but was 
disqualified due to not being enrolled in the school.

Many 
variations 
of 
the 
name 
Harbaugh 
were 

also 
reported, 
including 
“JJJJJJIIIMMMMMM 

HHHAAARRRRBBBBAAAUUUGGGHHHH” 
and 
“Coach 

Harbaugh,” as well as a slate of executive tickets including Harbaugh 

and the ‘Diag Squirrel’.

Other off-campus individuals written in included U.S. Sen. Bernie 

Sanders (D-Vt.) and Ohio Governor John Kasich (R), candidates for the 
Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, respectively, as 
well as Thomas Jefferson and Darth Vader.

Owner credits 

restaurant’s success 

to traditionally 
prepared dishes

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

For the past 38 years, Afternoon 

Delight has sat on the corner of 
East Liberty Street and South Fifth 
Avenue serving homemade specials 
to the Ann Arbor community. At 
peak hours, customers wait in 
a line that trails to the sidewalk 
outside, regardless of rain or shine.

Its secret? In an interview with 

The Michigan Daily, owner and 
manager Tom Hackett said he 
thought consistency was key to the 
restaurant’s success.

“If the customers wait in line a 

half hour, the food has to be exactly 
the way that they expect it,” he 
said. “The normal breakfast is very 
important. It has to be perfect; 
people are very fussy how they like 
their eggs. We’ll reject food off the 
line if it’s not right, and we’ll do it 

over.”

Hackett 
was 
working 
in 

restaurant sales equipment when 
the first Afternoon Delight opened 
up in Lansing, Michigan. He 
designed and sold the business 
all its equipment. Eventually, the 
restaurant’s 
success 
prompted 

stores in two more locations, in 
Ann Arbor and in Grand Rapids, to 
open their doors.

In 1978, Hackett joined the 

Ann Arbor location and became a 
partner. After 38 years of working 
at Afternoon Delight, he says he 
still loves his job.

“I never get tired of it,” he said. 

“I enjoy the people and the staff, 
and the job amazes me. I’ve seen 
some of the same people come 
in for the past 38 years, and seen 
their kids grow up. Now they’re 
bringing their grandkids.”

Regulars at Afternoon Delight 

said they return to the restaurant 
for the friendly staff and great 
atmosphere.

“I don’t think I’ve seen a whole 

lot change at all since I started 
coming here in the mid-80s,” 
said Ann Arbor resident Debbie 
Williams, a University of Michigan 

alum. “It has been the same great 
food and the same atmosphere 
and just the friendly staff. I think 
that’s one thing that makes it so 
successful.”

Afternoon 
Delight 
attracts 

many of its customers through 
word of mouth. Williams said she 
heard about the restaurant from a 
fellow teammate on the track and 
field team during her time at the 
University.

More than 30 years later, a 

path is seen among the younger 
generation.

“I heard about this place from 

my friends,” said LSA junior Clare 
Kang. “They all say it’s a place you 
have to go to if you’re in Ann Arbor. 
I’m definitely coming back — I 
want to try some other things on 
the menu, like the veggie boule.”

LSA senior Iris Fue said she liked 

the atmosphere of the restaurant, 
as well as the quality of the food.

“I love the cafe style of the 

restaurant,” she said. “The prices 
are really reasonable for the 
amount of food I get, and the food 
is really good. I got the smoked 
asalmon eggs Benedict, and it’s just

“It’s a really unique way of 

expressing yourself creatively,” 
Palermo said. “There’s nothing 
quite as risk-filled ... it can go 
really well or really bad. And 
when it goes really well, there’s 
nothing more satisfying.”

Risk-taking paid off as well 

for Paperback Rhino, a student 
group from the University of 
Iowa, who followed receSs. As 
part of their performance, the 
group interviewed a member 
of the audience and acted out 
sketches based on that audience 
member’s activities that day, 
including getting brunch at 
Angelo’s, ditching her friends to 
see a movie and receiving a poem 
from a stranger.

Independent improv comedy 

groups Wet Bus and Alterboyz, 
both from Chicago, closed the 
first part of the festival. Both 
groups elicited a reaction from 
the audience by improvising 
sketches 
from 
audience 

suggestions 
of 
cheese 
and 

blueberry beer, respectively.

Leila Gorstein, a member of 

Alterboyz, said connecting to 
the audience is one of the most 
important parts of improv.

“For audience members, it’s 

really enjoyable to watch people 
living the human experience 
in a way that they can relate to 
and understand,” Gorstein said. 

“That’s the most fun part about 
it, to take things from your life 
and use it in a human way.”

Midnight Book Club and 

ComCo, two students groups 
from the University, opened 
the second part of the festival. 
Midnight Book Club improvised 
a sketch based on the audience 
topic suggestion of “infant,” 
while ComCo performed improv 
games 
like 
“Four 
Square” 

consisting 
of 
four 
improv 

sketches based on audience 
suggestions.

Upright 
Citizens 
Brigade 

Touring Company, a New York 
City group featuring Michigan 
alum Mike Kelton, ended the 
festival by improvising a two-act 
performance.

The group’s first act involved 

the details of an interview with 
an audience member, a senior 
from the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance, about her 
experiences at the University, 
including Greek life, the brutality 
of acting classes and professors 
that make students cry. The 
second act incorporated text 
messages that audience members 
volunteered to read aloud.

LSA 
freshman 
Jeff 

Sondheimer said he enjoyed the 
spur-of-the-moment nature of 
improv.

“(Improv comedy) is real 

genuine comedy that has to be 
witnessed to really understand 
and get the value of,” he said. 
“I think it’s definitely prime 

entertainment. It’s good, safe 
fun.”

Fox, one of the coordinators 

of the event, said the hosts 
aimed to create a fun, enjoyable 
atmosphere and promote the 
camaraderie that comes from 
improv comedy.

“Getting to see each other 

play and see how other teams 
approach the same thing is the 
most rewarding thing,” Fox 
said. “And for people who are 
interested in pursuing theater, 
film, comedy and improv, I 
hope that they get the chance to 
meet a bunch of people who are 
interested in and doing the same 
things that they want to do ... 
and take the event as a chance to 
look at a bunch of people who do 
things that you love at a very high 
level.”

In addition to performing, 

the visiting improv groups said 
they took the festival as an 
opportunity to improve their 
routines by learning from the 
other groups.

“Seeing 
other 
people’s 

styles really opens your mind,” 
Palermo said. “We’re going to be 
talking a lot about what we saw 
from the other groups, what we 
liked about what they did ... and 
incorporate ideas that drive what 
they do”.

“We all come from a different 

background,” said Gaby Dixon, 
another member of Alterboyz. 
“But making people laugh is a 
very universal thing.”

Low-fidelity mannequins are 

similar to those used for teaching 
CPR because they do not give 
any feedback to the students, 
simulation specialist Ben Oliver 
said. 
Mid-fidelity 
mannequins 

have a few more capabilities, but 
cannot react like a human would.

High-fidelity mannequins are 

the most sophisticated of the 
three and are able to emit fluids 
such as artificial blood, vomit 
and sweat. They can also react 
to medication distribution, have 
pupils adjustable to light like a 
human’s eyes would and can give 
birth.

Clinical Instructor Maureen 

Westfall said Nursing instructors 
are 
able 
to 
program 
the 

mannequins either before or 
during the students’ simulation 
experience. In obstetrics, for 
example, she can program how 
many contractions the mannequin 
has while giving birth and how 
often.

“The focus of simulation is 

really problem-based learning,” 
Westfall said. “You use problem-
based learning in relation to 
objectives we create.”

Though the mannequin can 

react on its own in certain cases, 
the instructors often adjust the 
scenarios based on the students’ 
performance, 
Westfall 
said. 

She added that students should 
recognize signs and symptoms of 
medical issues the mannequins 
exhibit through clues provided 
by instructors. Each simulation 
session is recorded so students 
can look back and review their 
experience later.

“It’s safe space for us to 

help coach the students into 
managing these patient situations 
appropriately,” Westfall said.

During a planned simulation 

day, students come into the 
simulation room — usually in 
pairs — while other students 
watch the simulation via cameras. 
Michelle Aebersold, director of 
the Clinical Learning Center, said 
the students not participating can 
also play roles, such as a “frantic 
parent,” to make the simulation 
more challenging. Following 
the simulation, the students 
all gather for a debriefing to 
discuss how it went.

“If you don’t make these 

things 
challenging 
enough, 

then you don’t get the emotions 
involved and then it’s not a 
good experience and students 
don’t really get as involved 
in it and the learning doesn’t 
occur,” Aebersold said.

Nursing 
junior 
Sarah 

Brzezinski said she thinks it 
is beneficial to have hands-on 
experience that is safe for both 
the student and patient, while 
still difficult.

“You 
come 
into 

(simulations) and you never 
go unchallenged,” Brzezinski 
said. “If you do everything 
perfectly in sim, then you’re 
not learning and we’re not 
going our job. So I think it’s 
really good that they push us 
and they continue to challenge 
us and I think it’s very effective 
for the clinical setting.”

Aebersold said the overall 

benefit of simulations is that 
they can reduce the amount of 
time students need to spend in 
the clinical setting with real 
patients, with little effect on 
the students’ learning.

“We can effectively replace 

time in the actual clinical 
environment with simulation; 
up to 50 percent of those hours 
can be replaced by simulation, 
with no change in those pass 
rates on those state boards,” 
she said.

Nursing junior Jade Curl said 

working with the mannequins is a 
unique but effective experience.

“It feels real,” Curl said. “You 

don’t feel like you’re pretending. 
You walk in and you hold their 
hand and when you talk to them, 
you look them in the eye. It’s really 
odd thinking about how you act in 
the sim, because you don’t think 
about it. You just act like this is a 
real person. You give them respect. 
You’re excited when the baby 
comes out and the baby is fine.”

Because it can be difficult to get 

used to the robotic characteristics 
and mechanical sounds of the 
“patients,” students have to sign 
a fictional contract, agreeing they 
will treat them as if they were real.

“Sometimes 
it’s 
a 
learning 

curve for students to wrap their 
head around the fact that they 
should treat this robot as a real 
person,” Westfall said. “But what 
I’ve observed over time is that 
that is pretty short-lived because 
the learners we do have here are 
highly motivated and want to do 
well and want to understand … 
They really do act as if the patient 
is a real person.”

Westfall said the mannequins 

also have the capability of dying, 
though this is usually part of a 
planned learning experience so 
as not to be traumatic for the 
students.

“It’s most important because it’s 

a great stepping stone to patient-
care exposure for the students,” 
Westfall said. “It provides an 
excellent lead-in to the real clinical 
environment and it promotes 
more 
confidence 
once 
the 

student is in the real clinical 
environment.”

Nursing junior Rebecca Ford 

said simulations are something 
she will never forget.

“Nothing sticks in your head 

the way it does when you screw 
up in sim,” Ford said. “Being 
able to get an interactive 
experience 
makes 
you 

remember things way more 
than reading it or someone 
teaching it to you, especially if 
you messed up the first time. 
That’s the coolest thing about 
sim — we’re allowed to mess 
up and it’s OK; we talk about it 
and learn from it.”

“Access to data, the different types 
of data and the way you put that 
data to use, as well as the increasing 
interconnection of businesses due 
to communication, play a vital role 
in economic growth.”

Following 
his 
address, 

Chandrasekaran took questions 
from the audience, noting the 
importance of transparency and 
cybersecurity in maintaining a 
successful business, as well as the 
significance of the relationship 
between India and China.

“China is certainly a great 

market; it is a great place,” 
Chandrasekaran 
said. 
“Going 

forward, China and India need to 
look to see what we can do together 
to improve our business relations. 
Both nations can look to each other 
to try and notice what successes 
that businesses from both nations 
have had in IT services and attempt 
to replicate those practices, and 
push for reform.”

Mukesh Aghi, the president of 

the U.S.-India Business Council, a 
Washington, D.C.-based advocacy 
organization, also spoke at the 
event 
about 
future 
business 

opportunities between the two 
nations. 

Aghi 
said 
because 
of 

India’s rapid urbanization and 
modernization, there will also be 
a need for foreign investment in 
Indian infrastructure.

“Roughly 400 million Indians 

have migrated from rural to 
urban areas,” Aghi said. “This is 
the largest migration in human 
history, ever. And that means that 
cities will have to build roads, 
hospitals, a better education and 
security 
system, 
housing 
and 

transportation system. That is a 
tremendous challenge, but also 
a tremendous opportunity for 
multinational investment.”

On Saturday, the conference 

featured panels on brand building 
in India, the textile industry in 
India, current issues in the Indian 
economy 
and 
managing 
the 

institutional legal environment for 
businesses.

Sinha, the featured speaker 

on Saturday, spoke about the 
economic turbulence in India 
following reform policies in 1991 
in which India’s finance minister, 
Manmohan 
Singh 
presented 

reforms 
changing 
business 

regulations.

Sinha 
shared 
stories 
from 

his tenure as finance minister, 
saying that the two decades of 
economic instability in the country 
are largely attributed to lack of 
government support for economic 
reform policies.

“In 
India, 
economics 
and 

business is a slave to politics,” 
Sinha said. “Much of what has 
been causing our periods of 
economic troubles has been a lack 
of political consensus over the 
proposed reform policies. This is 
something that you can see in all 
major parties.”

Ahuja 
said 
the 
conference 

should be important for students 
in understanding the ever-growing 
international business world and 
globalization.

“We want to broaden people’s 

understanding of India, and the 
U.S. business relationship with 
India,” Ahuja said. “We have to 
prepare our students for the global 
marketplace, and since India is the 
second-largest population in the 
world, a very young population, 
India is rapidly becoming the 
country of the future.”

Wiesenberger, a member of Izzat, 
said the team has been working 
on their numbers since September, 
adding that his past experiences 
with dance contributed to his 
decision to participate here.

“I really enjoyed the Bollywood 

and Bhangra style (in high school) 
so I decided to continue that at U 
of M,” he said. “And it’s nice to see 
the consolidation of all the Indian 
(performing arts) in one show 
where everyone supports each 
other.”

LSA sophomore Dhara Gosalia, 

public relations chair of Sahana, 
said Michigan Sahana created a 
TBS planning committee this year 
to ease the huge undertaking of 
organizing the show, which also 
requires long-term planning.

“We usually have to start looking 

for venues a year in advance,” 
Gosalia said.

D

uring 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 

victory 
speech 
after 

winning the South Carolina 

primary 
on 

February 27, she 
went bold:

“I 
know 
it 

sometimes 
seems 
a 
little 

odd for someone 
running 
for 

president these 
days, 
in 
this 

time, to say we 
need more love 
and kindness in 
America,” 
she 

said. “But I’m telling you from the 
bottom of my heart, we do. We do.”

This wasn’t the first time I had 

heard about Clinton’s desire to talk 
about needing to instill love and 
kindness in America. BuzzFeed’s 
Ruby Cramer wrote a lengthy 
feature titled “Hillary Clinton 
wants to talk to you about love and 
kindness” at the end of January, 
and it’s worth a read. But this 
speech was the first time I had seen 
Clinton discuss love and kindness 
on a national stage.

We could argue for hours as to 

whether Clinton is the right person 
to be delivering this message. After 
all, she did vote for the unjustified 
Iraq War, doesn’t support the total 
abolishment of the death penalty 
across the nation and once referred 
to kids in gangs, presumably Black, 
as “super predators.” Of course I’m 
setting aside many of the efforts 
she’s made to bolster the rights 
of minority communities, but it’s 
hard to argue these three things 
represent decisions made with 
love and kindness. To me, these 
instances represent a failure to 
value humanity.

But no matter what you think 

about Clinton, her message of love 
and kindness is one we all need to 
hear — and internalize. I know I’m 
not breaking this news, but anger 
and 
nastiness 
has 
permeated 

every corner of this election. It’s 
simply out of hand.

The 
venom 
tossed 
by 
(gag) 

Republican 
front-runner 
Donald 

Trump, who I’m sure has proclaimed 
himself to be the nicest man in 
the world, is gross, despicable and 
disheartening (feel free to insert your 
own adjective). The violence at his 
rallies, which he absolutely incites — 
don’t let him tell you otherwise — has 
me questioning what exactly is going 
on in America.

And 
the 
other 
remaining 

Republican 
candidates 
besides 

Ohio 
Gov. 
John 
Kasich 
are 

contributors to this problem. And 
to a lesser extent, the angry tone 
of Bernie Sanders’ message can be 
exhausting to listen to sometimes 
(the #BirdieSanders moment was 
pretty awesome, though).

People have a right to be angry 

about the current realities of the 
United States. In fact, they should 

be. Our economy is rigged to 
favor those at the top. We aren’t 
doing enough for lower-income 
communities. Institutional racism 
is alive and well. It’s a disaster that 
we don’t have paid family leave and 
equal pay for women. Our campaign 
finance system is out of control. I 
could go on, but the point remains: 
These are legitimate issues to lose 
sleep over and have steam coming 
out of ears.

And it’s not that I need Barney or 

Big Bird to explain these outrages 
in song and dance. But at a certain 
point, the presidential candidates 
and the people of the United States 
need to recognize the limitations 

of anger. This isn’t me saying that 
the protests should stop, because 
given how much traction Trump 
is gaining by winning one primary 
after another, they’re still needed. 
I just think we have to realize that 
when it’s time to write the policy 
and fix our wrongs, anger won’t 
solve these problems. Anger only 
identifies them. And nastiness? 
There’s no place for it (I’m talking 
to you, Big Donald).

The funny (actually not that 

funny) thing is that love and 
kindness aren’t ingrained in the 
United States’ values. After all, 
we were founded on violence. 
We owned slaves for hundreds of 
years where plenty of places today 
are actively trying to bury that 
part of our history. Lawmakers 
actively wrote policy to damage 
minority communities. And we’ve 
committed plenty of war crimes.

So instilling love and kindness into 

our national mindset would actually 
be a radical idea.

Now, of course, we all have 

different definitions of what love 
and kindness means. I’ll start by 
giving mine. Love and kindness is a 
belief in the humanity of all people, 
that we are all capable of success 
given the opportunity. Love and 
kindness is a belief in the power 
of community — the belief that in 
order to have a just society, we have 
to look out for each other’s needs 
and not just our own.

I know what I’ve laid out is 

idealistic, and frankly there are 
plenty of times when toughness is 
absolutely needed. But at the simplest 
level, love and kindness is another 
way of saying, “Let’s not screw each 
other over.”

You may have a definition that 

doesn’t quite jive with mine. Or at all.

But I’m sure whatever it is, it’d 

be a lot better than what we have 
right now.

A little more love and kindness

Clinton’s message of 
love and kindness is 
one we all need to 

hear and internalize.

D

espite my opposition, the University of 
Michigan announced two weeks ago 
that former New York City mayor and 

uber-capitalist 
Michael 

Bloomberg will speak at 
Spring 
Commencement 

and receive an honorary 
degree.

In 
their 
proposal, 

University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
and 

the 
Honorary 
Degree 

Committee wrote, “Mr. 
Bloomberg … you are 
a role model for civic 
leaders, 
students, 
and 

others who aspire to be 
agents of change. The 
University of Michigan celebrates your 
storied career and contributions to business, 
philanthropy, and effective government, 
and is proud to present to you the honorary 
degree, Doctor of Laws.”

Following 
the 
announcement, 
The 

Michigan 
Daily 
published 
an 
article 

elaborating 
the 
argument 
behind 
the 

University’s 
above 
claims 
(e.g., 
that 

Bloomberg is “a role model for civil leaders,” 
etc.). The article described Bloomberg’s 
business accomplishments, such as founding 
the 
major 
Wall 
Street 
data-tracking 

company, Bloomberg L.P., as well as his 
political accomplishments, such as creating 
a $4.4 billion budget surplus during his 
mayoralty. Though the article briefly noted 
that Bloomberg and the New York Police 
Department’s stop-and-frisk practice was 
“received with controversy,” it failed to 
explore the reasons for the controversy.

Readers of the Daily have not received the 

benefit of any sort of dissident reporting on 
this issue, such as hearing the opinions of 
students and faculty who might be opposed 
to Bloomberg’s invitation, and/or reviewing 
the problematic portions of Bloomberg’s 
record. Journalists, even on the small scale 
of a college newspaper, have a responsibility 
not to simply support those in power (e.g., the 
University administration, Board of Regents, 
etc.), but rather to check their authority with 
reporting that complicates, problematizes 
and, when appropriate, contradicts the 
establishment narrative.

Until now, the paper has not published any 

article or op-ed exploring why Bloomberg 
might not be a good choice for commencement 
speaker and honorary degree recipient. The 
reasons that form this dissenting opinion 
abound, but they are apparently uninteresting 
to my colleagues.

When we choose to model ourselves after 

someone, we presumably already resemble 
this person to some extent. Paying attention 
to his personal identity, we notice that 
Bloomberg is a super-rich, old white man, an 
identity that literally no University students 
share. The University esteems Bloomberg as a 
role model because he resembles the rich, old 
white men who have run this University since 
the time of its inception.

In our white supremacist patriarchal 

capitalist society, a role model is by 
definition a person with an identity like 
Bloomberg’s. Hence, within the University’s 
consciousness, a working-class woman of 
color, for example, cannot qualify as a role 
model, and hence isn’t invited to speak at 
commencement. So despite its incessant 
protestations that it highly values diversity, 
the University decided not to actualize 
that supposed principle, opting instead to 
continue its long history of supporting the 
voices of rich, old white men over the voices 
of young people, women, people of color and 
poor and working classes.

I also find it incredible that anyone 

familiar with Bloomberg’s record as mayor 
of New York City could see fit to honor him 

with a “Doctor of Laws” degree. The Daily’s 
article noted that Bloomberg served three 
terms as mayor of New York City, but it didn’t 
note that Bloomberg changed the term-limit 
law during his second term as mayor so that 
he could serve for a third.

When it looked like a fellow NYC 

billionaire might obstruct Bloomberg’s 
effort 
to 
maintain 
power, 
Bloomberg 

promised his would-be opponent a seat on 
an influential board in exchange for his 
consent. It worked, and Bloomberg revised 
the term-limit law and was eventually 
elected for a third term — a problematic 
twist in Bloomberg’s “storied career” as a 
“civic leader,” but maybe one inconvenient 
for the University as they coronate him an 
honorary doctor of the law. (Maybe the 
more apt honorary degree for Bloomberg 
would be “surgeon of the law.”)

Perhaps the most glaring blemish on 

Bloomberg’s mayoral record is the New York 
Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practice 
(aka stop-question-frisk), whereby police 
officers who suspect someone (usually an 
African-American or Hispanic person) of 
committing a crime may stop, question and 
then frisk them. Critics of stop-and-frisk 
emphasize, like I just did, how this policing 
practice disparately impacts people of color, 
both in the number of stops and consequent 
arrests, arguing that stop-and-frisk codifies 
racial profiling and amounts to a campaign of 
harassment against Black and brown people.

Bloomberg has defended the practice by 

pointing out that Blacks and Hispanics are 
far more likely to commit crimes, suggesting 
that racial profiling might therefore be 
a legitimate policing practice. This is an 
example of institutional racism and an 
instance of the law and its police oppressing 
people of color while in fact rhetorically 
denying their oppressiveness. Stop-and-frisk 
should disqualify Bloomberg as a doctor of 
the law, assuming that a doctor of the law 
should value things like civil rights and 
oppose things like institutional racism.

Lastly, one might confusedly conjecture 

that the University ought, to some degree, 
express the will of the state it supposedly 
serves. But alas, no. In the very same month 
that the majority of Michigan’s Democratic 
primary voters chose Sen. Bernie Sanders (D 
–

Vt.), the staunch opponent of the billionaire 
class, as their party’s nominee, the University 
invited Bloomberg, a multi-billionaire Wall 
Street capitalist. The University could’ve 
chosen someone fighting against the current 
political-economic establishment, the one 
that many graduating seniors will soon 
suffer under full time as young, debt-rich 
wage slaves. Instead, the University chose 
to invite a fierce market fundamentalist 
firmly embedded within this country’s (not 
to mention the world’s) politico-economic 
establishment.

In sum, we might have serious reservations 

about Michael Bloomberg as this year’s 
Spring Commencement speaker, not to 
mention reservations about lauding him 
as our role model for civic leadership and 
affecting change.

When 
the 
University 
administration 

writes that “The University of Michigan 
celebrates 
(Bloomberg’s) 
storied 
career 

and contributions to business,” and then 
the Daily corroborates their argument as 
for why, dissenting opinions like mine (i.e., 
the opinions of University students who 
decidedly do not celebrate Bloomberg’s 
career or contributions but instead condemn 
them) are erased. Maybe these dissident 
opinions are, on the whole, wrong, but they 
deserve some consideration, as do the less 
flattering aspects of Bloomberg’s record.

M

arch 10, 2014, will be a 
day I never forget. After 
waiting four years to see 

my favorite band, 
Arcade 
Fire, 

perform 
live, 

they were finally 
coming to play 
at The Palace of 
Auburn Hills for 
a stop on their 
Reflektor 
tour. 

My friend Ethan 
and 
I 
bought 

tickets 
and 
I 

drove so fast to 
the Palace after 
school 
that 
I 

broke my record time driving there 
by 15 minutes. However, because I 
accidentally bought the wrong ticket, 
I wasn’t able to get one of those yellow 
wristbands that allowed you to stand 
on the floor, looking up on the stage. 
I told Ethan to go have the time of 
his life, and he descended toward the 
stage while I settled with the most 
expensive ticket in the lower bowl.

Initially I was frustrated that I 

couldn’t let Win Butler’s guitar burst 
my eardrums from up close, but I was 
even more anxious that I was around 
so many people. I was surrounded 
by strangers with no one to talk to. 
The band asked that everyone wear 
either a costume or formal attire to 
the show. I took my coat off revealing 
a Where’s Waldo outfit and saw 
everyone else in dresses and dress 
clothes. How ironic it was that I 
wanted someone to find me.

Once Arcade Fire started to play, 

I couldn’t help but sing along. These 
were the songs that my heart had 
been humming for years (I know 
all 69 of their songs by heart). But 
my mind was hesitant to dance 
when my body wanted to cut loose. 
I looked next to both sides of me 
and saw two women in their late 
20s and a middle-aged man looking 
back at me. We danced and lost our 
voices singing and I felt awesome 
being able to be myself around 
complete strangers.

I thought that was the moment 

I broke out of my shell, but the 
reality is that I’m still in the 

process of emerging out of it.

Like my hesitancy to dance at 

the concert, I have a hesitancy to be 
fully myself, displaying my complete 
personality around people I don’t 
know as well. The people I know well 
and feel I can completely trust see my 
inner layers — the layers that express 
my religion, show how I convey 
feelings through poetry and do weird 
things like churn out fake details 
about a beverage after wafting it 
like a sommelier (“oak after-tones, 
French, from the southern Rhône 
valley, circa 1985”).

If the people I am close to enjoy 

peeling away at these layers and 
learning more about me, I should 
be able to do this easily around 
everyone I meet. But I have 
struggled with thinking what I 
have to say won’t be worthwhile. 
The introverted parts of me have 
caused me to be quiet, sometimes 
making me feel out of place around 
a lot of people, the inner dialogue 
I’m having with myself giving 

me more anxiety because I’m not 
speaking.

I’ve always thought that getting 

to know people is a process, and it 
is. But I’ve been thinking about it 
in the wrong way. I’ve saved more 
of my personality for closer friends, 
presenting 
a 
held-back 
version 

of myself to others that is more 
reserved, quieter and less prone to 
sharing my emotions. I have always 
wanted to share the deeper parts of 
my life with people until I know them 
very well — as I should. But there’s 
nothing wrong with letting other 
people see the wannabe-sommelier, 
air-guitaring, dance-loving me.

Sure, if I reveal more of who 

I am initially, people may think 
I’m weird, but the reward far 
outweighs the risk. If I don’t 
allow my mind to be so reserved 
and watered down, I have more 
opportunities to build friendships 
and show people that I am 
interested in what they have to 
say. I enjoy getting to know people, 
hearing about what intrigues and 
excites them, but sometimes that 
doesn’t come across because I 
don’t speak up.

I may have missed out on 

opportunities to learn more about 
others, but there will be plenty 
more. As I’m breaking out of my 
shell, I’m attempting to be more 
outgoing and let go of the reins 
that have slowed me down. I don’t 
want to filter myself so much. 
I want to go on adventures and 
try new things. I want to say yes 
instead of saying no and retreating 
to being by myself.

Just over two years have passed 

since the Arcade Fire concert. 
Instead of being a high schooler next 
to two women in their late 20s and 
a middle-aged man, I’m in college, 
surrounded by extroverts, and I want 
to be outgoing and free like them. 
The process won’t be easy, and I’ll 
always be introverted in a sense, but 
I’m confident that I can start saying 
what’s on my mind no matter who is 
around because that’s what I want 
to do. I want to be the same person 
whether I’m next to my best friend or 
an acquaintance.

We introverts can still take time 

to recharge. But if we’re having 
trouble being outgoing, we have the 
freedom to and can be ourselves 
without fear. It can be very out of 
our comfort zones, but I believe we 
can learn the most about ourselves 
from and by being around others as 
opposed to alone.

I’ve felt alone and different in 

a crowd of people. But this at this 
time in my life, I won’t dress up like 
Waldo. Instead, I’ll always try to just 
be my real self.

outgoing and let go of

A2 makeup artist 
gives hot style tips

By DAILY STYLE WRITERS

There is so much more to 

someone’s style than clothing. 
Jewelry, shoes, hair and make-
up, to name a few, are all indica-
tors of personal style. Makeup 
in particular, for both men and 
women, serves as a higher form 
of self-expression. The use of 
cosmetics to enhance appear-
ance or disguise is dated back to 
the times of Ancient Greece and 
Egypt. From creams and oils, to 
brightly colored paints for the 
eyes and face, makeup is so much 
more than a means to cover up 
imperfections. It has the ability 
to showcase a person’s mood and 
personality, as well as artistic 
talent.

Fast forward to 2016 — with 

the rise of social media plat-
forms like Instagram and Snap-
chat, the popularity of makeup 
has skyrocketed. With so many 
new beauty bloggers, trends and 
techniques, it’s hard to keep up. 
For example, bold brows and liq-
uid lipsticks are in full force as 
the most popular beauty trends 
today. But how does one create 
a bold brow? There are so many 
options to pick from — think 
tinted eyebrow gels, powders 
and pencils. It’s all too over-
whelming.

To answer those questions, 

The Michigan Daily Style Squad 
talked all things makeup with 
Ann Arbor’s best, Moriah Mierre 
Martin — including a makeup 
tutorial. Martin began seriously 
experimenting with makeup at 
the age of 20. So for all the stu-
dents still itching to get into 
makeup, there is still hope.

What is even more inspiring 

is the fact that Martin learned 
by simply watching YouTube 
tutorials. Watching the work of 
beauty bloggers on a daily basis 
and subsequently practicing to 
gain a true mastery, Martin has 
come a long way. As a freelance 
artist, who travels from cli-
ent to client, she is stationed at 
En’Fusion Beaute’ Salon.

Turning a passion into a full-

blown career, she has gotten the 
opportunity to do makeup for a 
range of clients and events. One 
amazing experience in particu-
lar was her work on Rap Artist 
Big Sean for Adidas’ #Imagined-
By series titled “One Man Can 
Change Detroit.” Not only did 
she manage to make Big Sean 
look even more flawless, but 
Martin describes the rapper as 
“the most humble and genuine 
person” she has had the oppor-
tunity to work with.

From working with model/

actor Shaun Ross, the first male 
Albino professional model, to 
being the featured makeup artist 
at The Powerful Women’s Week-
end Conference last spring, held 
in Ann Arbor yearly, Martin has 
made the most of her talents and 
her Michigan surroundings.

With aspirations to break into 

the beauty industry even more 
in the coming year, Martin said 
her dream client would have to 
be Queen Bey herself. Beyonce’s 
naturally stunning facial fea-
tures would be any makeup 
artist’s dream, so can we really 
blame her?

For the tutorial, we asked 

Martin to show us how to do a 
natural, everyday makeup look 
that incorporated some of the 
popular trends we see today. 
Michigan Daily style writer, 
Hannah Sparks, turned model 

for the demonstration.

Martin began with a blank 

canvas, a.k.a. a face without any 
makeup. This allowed Martin to 
begin her work from scratch, in a 
sense. Starting with some prim-
er, the beautifying began. After 
Hannah was all set and primed, 
the next step was applying foun-
dation with a beauty blender for 
the best (and most natural) cov-
erage. Beauty blenders, other-
wise known as those egg-shaped 
sponges, seem to be all the rage in 
the world of makeup.

Post foundation, concealer was 

applied, which started to make a 
noticeable difference on Han-
nah, making skin look luminous 
and perfect. The real MVP of this 
tutorial was the contouring that 
took place. It’s not what you may 
be thinking though — no insane 
Kardashian 
contouring 
was 

done. Instead, Martin showed us 
a way to keep it subtle, for every-
day wear. It’s amazing how far a 
little contour can go. Using some 
light, powder-based shadows, 
she was able to give more struc-
ture to our model’s face. In addi-
tion to contouring, Martin used 
a highlighter/illuminator that 
made Hannah’s skin look bright 
and dewy. The key is to place the 
highlighter atop all parts of the 
face that capture natural light, so 
to amplify it.

Next came one of the most 

important steps: the bold brows. 
Turns out, it’s not as hard as it 
looks. Martin sculpted Hannah’s 
brows with patience and mas-
tery, all with a brow pencil in a 
shade lighter than her eyebrow 
hair. Bold brows really manage to 
frame the face. Post brows, Mar-
tin quickly placed a light touch of 
shimmering eyeshadow with a 
swipe of mascara.

Finally, for the lips, Mar-

tin used a matte liquid lipstick, 
which are also all the rage right 
now (think LipkitbyKylie). The 
shade was a mauvey brown color 
and the matte texture was per-
fect to complement Hannah’s 
shimmery eyes.

The complete look created was 

a basic glam that can be taken 
from day to night. With enough 
patience, even the average Uni-
versity of Michigan student can 
watch Martin’s techniques and 
be able to recreate this go-to 
glam masterpiece. Sticking with 
a neutral palette, accompanied 
by some shades of bronzy browns 
to add depth, Martin created our 
new go-to look.

With every answer to our many 

questions, you could hear the 
knowledge and passion behind 
Martin’s words. Despite the 
abundance of social media out-
lets available today, Martin says 
she “constantly [tries] to research 
and keep up with the latest looks 
and trends as much as possible.” 
Her favorite Insta-beauty blog-
gers are Makeupshayla, Nikki-
etutorials, Amrezy, Jackie Aina, 
Desi Perkins, Lustrelux, Kilprity 
and Renny Vasquez.

While she does keep up with 

all the latest and craziest make-
up trends, Martin admits that 
many of the huge trends have 
become 
borderline 
extreme. 

“Some of these trends have taken 
it to another level with too many 
unnecessary steps, making it 
seem difficult,” she said.

When asked her thoughts on 

highlighting and contouring, a 
trend that has infiltrated You-
Tube and beauty blogs, Mierre 
said the key to successfully con-

quering it is “one good contour 
powder palette” and “a great 
highlighter.” Her favorite line for 
both products is Anastasia Bev-
erly Hills. However, she doesn’t 
only rely on high-end makeup.

Martin 
incorporates 
both 

high-end products as well as 
more 
accessible, 
drugstore 

items. Some of her favorite items 
include NARS All-Day Luminous 
foundations, Laura Mercier set-
ting powder, Anastasia Beverly 
Hills brow pencils and contour 
palettes and Too Faced Better 
than Sex mascara. On the more 
affordable side she loves, May-
belline Fit Me foundations, Nyx 
micro brow pencils and brow 
gels and ColourPop eyeshadows 
lipsticks. Martin’s number one 
tip for great makeup, however, is 
not about which products to use. 
“Great makeup starts with great 
skin care!” she says, “When 
you take care of your skin, your 
makeup will look even better 
and more flawless!”

makeup looks by Martin, or have 
any questions about the work 
she did with the Daily Style 
Squad? She showcases much of 
her work on social media: Ins-

‘Greek’ runs familiar 
themes into ground

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

The movie theater for “My Big 

Fat Greek Wedding 2” is pretty 
packed. We’ve gotten there a full 15 
minutes before 
the start time 
and just man-
aged to eke out 
a spot in the 
front, 
push-

ing past spilled 
M&Ms 
and 

oversized bags 
of 
popcorn 

being 
passed 

row 
to 
row. 

The room is 
full of parents 
with sulky teenagers, kids run-
ning through the aisles or groups 
of old lady best friends on a night 
out. I’m home with my family for 
Easter weekend, and we brought 
my grandma.

I knew I was in for an interest-

ing moviegoing experience when 
almost everyone in the auditorium 
clapped along to the chain the-
ater’s catchy jingle. The crowd was 
uproarious, and at times I won-
dered if the film had laid a laugh 
track over its quintessential bits.

The original “My Big Fat Greek 

Wedding” was a universal family 
classic, so of course they’d produce 
a sequel to draw in the masses. 
Although it centers around the 

overbearing and colorful Greek 
culture in which the protagonist, 
Toula (Nia Vardalos, “My Life in 
Ruins”) attempts to build a life, the 
original film has appeal for anyone 
with aunts who are a little too loud, 
cousins who get a little too drunk 
and a family that holds onto tradi-
tion and loyalty a little too tightly. 

The filmmakers have obvious-

ly had time to think about what 
made the first film successful, but 
the sequel uses these themes to 
run the movie into the ground. 
Immediately, about four different 
storylines begin unfolding, and 
the jokes that were unexpectedly 
weird and funny in the first film 
are stretched into oblivion. Toula’s 
daughter, Paris (Elena Kampouris, 
“Men, Women, and Children”), is 
looking at going to college far away 
and she feels silenced by her over-
bearing family. The grandparents, 
Maria (Lainie Kazan, “Pixels”) 
and Gus (Michael Constantine, 
“Sirota’s Court”), find out their 
marriage was unofficial and have 
to remarry in an elaborate cere-
mony. Cousin Angelo (Joey Fatone, 
“Rewrapped”) is apparently gay. 
The original movie’s couple is hav-
ing trouble remembering the spark 
that brought them together in the 
first place, and at the same time 
their daughter is finding love in an 
unexpected Greek suitor. There’s 
so much going on that I could keep 
going, and I know I could map a 

direct line between what moment 
in the original inspired each of the 
sequel’s jokes. The quasi-romantic 
scenes are buried under the rap-
id-fire pacing of the film, and the 
sweet sentimentality of the origi-
nal is lost in the overwrought and 
John Legend-soundtracked con-
struction of the plot.

All of this somehow doesn’t 

mean watching it isn’t an enjoy-
able experience, though. It’s pretty 
infectious to be in a room of people 
nudging each other every few 
minutes and remarking on which 
member of their own family each 
line reminds them of. To my right, 
my grandma has to take her glasses 
off multiple times to wipe her eyes 
after laughing so hard. There’s a 
little old ethnic great-grandma 
character who, much like my own 
106-year-old Nana, keeps popping 
out of the woodwork with pans of 
baklava. The hilarious Aunt Voula 
(Andrea Martin, “SCTV”) keeps 
sharing way too much about her 
various moles, rashes and out of 
this world afflictions. It’s a carica-
ture portrait large enough to hold 
a detail that hits home for most 
watching, and so while the jum-
bled storyline and drawn out gags 
make it a somewhat unbearable 
watch, “My Big Fat Greek Wed-
ding 2” at least provides a few good 
laughs and a somewhat amusing 
moviegoing experience.

‘Missoula’ tackles 
victim blaming

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

If 
you 
somehow 
missed 

“Missoula: Rape and the Justice 
System in a College Town” when 
it 
became 

a 
national 

bestseller 
around 
this 

time 
last 

year, the first 
paperback 
edition has now 
been 
released 

by 
Anchor 

Books. Urgency 
resonates with 
every 
page, 

making 
it 

impossible 
to 

put down.

The 
book 

represents the culmination of Jon 
Krakauer’s (“Under the Banner of 
Heaven”) painstaking research 
and re-crafting of several cases 
of sexual assault or rape in 
Missoula, Montana over four 
years. He zeroes in on the culture 
of athlete worship that schools 
with big sports teams have to deal 
with. Krakauer throws a harsh 
spotlight on what news pundits 
or other skeptics are actually 
conveying when they dismiss the 
problem of sexual assault and 
rape on college campuses as rape 
hysteria. When they argue that 
activists — namely, feminists — 
are manipulating assault cases 
for the sake of their agenda, they 
make it more and more difficult 
for victims of assault to be heard. 
It’s a dangerously effective form 
of silencing.

One of the main functions of 

“Missoula” is to demonstrate that 
the idea of women frequently 

“crying rape” — because they 
regret bad sex, to cover up 
cheating on a significant other, 
for revenge — is one of the most 
dangerous myths about sexual 
assault circulating throughout 
the country. The effects of these 
myths are found not only in the 
minds of people sitting on the 
jury, but in the mores of police 
precincts, in offices of district 
attorneys and even in the behavior 
of police or campus security 
officers 
who 
are 
sometimes 

the most immediately available 
people to whom rape survivors 
can turn.

Krakauer 
emphasizes 
that 

rape is the only crime for which 
the survivors or victims of the 
crime are on trial just as much 
as — if not more than — the 
defendants. He wryly points out 
that the oath to tell the truth only 
applies to witnesses. Others in the 
courtroom, like defense attorneys, 
prosecutors and judges, aren’t 
beholden to it. Even due process 
for defendants puts survivors in 
a precarious position from the 
start. The needs of the courtroom 
— 
presenting 
challenges 
to 

credibility, submitting witnesses 
to yes-or-no questioning rather 
than giving them opportunities 
to talk freely, confronting those 

who may be perpetrators — come 
before the needs of the victim.

Reading this book is like 

repeatedly being punched in the 
stomach. The details Krakauer 
includes sound like tasteless 
jokes. A coach equivocates on 
the definition of rape while 
testifying on behalf of an accused 
rapist, then mentions that he is a 
sexual education teacher. Police 
officers ask women if they have 
boyfriends when they report 
rapes (implying they cheated 
and now feel guilty). Prosecutors 
badger survivors on the stand, 
asking if they are sure they 
communicated a lack of consent 
well enough.

Yet despite how difficult it is to 

be faced with the testimony and 
primary documents Krakauer 
includes, nothing in “Missoula” 
feels 
overly 
sentimental, 

manipulative 
or 
exploitative. 

The 
pathos 
is 
organic; 
he 

evokes 
empathy 
without 

sensationalizing 
any 
of 
the 

stories he is telling. His inclusion 
of several studies and statistics 
never pulls focus from the social 
critiques he’s making; they only 
serve to accentuate the truth of 
his arguments, hitting a sobering 
conclusion towards the end:

“Rape 
is 
the 
most 

underreported 
crime 
in 
the 

nation. … When an individual is 
raped in this country, more than 
90 percent of the time the rapist 
gets away with the crime.”

One of Krakauer’s final points 

is that university processes for 
investigating 
and 
prosecuting 

sexual assaults have not been 
standardized across the nation. 
The lack of support is another 
reason that people may feel 
uncomfortable coming forward 
about being assaulted; they 
often literally have no idea what 
will happen. Krakauer finishes 
on a strong note: by speaking out 
and coming forward, survivors 
become part of a network that 
makes it easier for others to 
follow in their footsteps.

‘Were None’ a new 
formal masterpiece

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Ten little soldier boys went out 

to dine;

One choked his little self and 

then there were Nine.”

Ten 

strangers 
arrive 
on 

Soldier Island. 
They 
eat 

lobster soufflé, 
smoke 
cigars, 

exchange war 
stories 
and 

engage in an 
epic 
display 

of 
British 

snobbery. And 
then, just as the nursery rhyme 
that conveniently decorates the 
walls of their hosts’ mansion 
foreshadows, the strangers are 
poetically 
murdered. 
Based 

on the famous mystery novel, 
BBC’s miniseries “And Then 
There Were None” is one of the 
best literary screen adaptations 
of 
Agatha 
Christie’s 
work, 

beautifully 
capturing 
the 

nuances of her storytelling in a 
visual masterpiece that merits 
wild praise of its own.

Rarely is a work of visual 

media so powerfully enthralling 
that the present day, filled with 
all its glorious gadgets and 
distractions, disappears. Yet, 
the 1939 world of “And Then 
There Were None” masterfully 
takes 
precedence 
over 

real 
time. 
Simultaneously 

evoking conflicting emotions 
that 
millennials 
are 
rarely 

challenged to sort through, 
the three-part series is both 
tragically 
beautiful 
and 

hauntingly mesmerizing.

While 
BBC 
consistently 

produces 
breathtaking 

cinematic pieces, like “Downton 
Abbey” and “War and Peace,” 
their latest series surpasses 
even their own high standards. 
“And 
Then 
There 
Were 

None” employs a creativity in 
cinematography that introduces 
unexpected angles and lighting 
that sets itself apart from 

the 
network’s 
other 
series. 

Interspersed 
between 
BBC’s 

signature sweeping landscapes 
are shots that capture an image 
so intriguing and abstract that 
an early 20th century period 
drama becomes laced with an 
element of modernity. It’s shots 
like these, when the viewer 
finds himself gazing up from 
the ocean floor at a woman in 
a scarlet red bathing suit, the 
sunlight 
perfectly 
outlining 

her silhouette, that make “And 
Then There Were None” stand 
out as an artistic statement.

Adapting 
a 
renowned 

literary work runs the risk of 
sacrificing 
crucial 
nuances 

FILM REVIEW

BBC

Row, row, row your boat...

for plot. The complexity of 
Agatha Christie’s masterpiece, 
however, is preserved by the 
incredible 
performances 
of 

the cast members. Whether 
it be an overextended gaze or 
an 
off-putting 
smolder, 
the 

actors 
add 
personality 
and 

emotion to even the smallest 
moments. Each character is 
colored by a complex backstory, 
their secrets and lies slowly 
uncovered throughout the three 
installments.

Perfectly 
paced, 
the 

miniseries 
is 
captivating 

from 
beginning 
to 
end. 

Living through the camera, 
which takes on a personality 
of its own, the audience is 
simultaneously 
hunting 
and 

being hunted. Teetering on the 
line of horror, orchestral music 
climbing 
to 
uncomfortably 

eerie notes, “And Then There 
Were None” never allows for a 
moment of boredom. Each scene 
serves a purpose and no detail 
is accidentally unveiled. The 
thrilling momentum produces 
a surprise at every turn, but 
still allows time to capture 
longing looks and linger on 
the 
impeccable 
costuming 

and set design. You’re never 
comfortable, always on the edge 
of your seat, and constantly 
concocting crime theories.

And then, just when you 

think you’ve figured it all out, 
relishing in your astuteness and 
patting yourself on the back for 
outsmarting one of literature’s 
most brilliant murder mystery 
writers, the end leaves you 
completely dumbfounded.

“One little soldier boy left all 

alone;

He went and hanged himself,
And then there were None.”

Rhimes’s ‘The Catch’ 
doesn’t add to ‘TGIT’

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Very few brands are as 

powerful as Shonda Rhimes’s 
(“Scandal”). She is so important 
to ABC as a 
network to the 
point where it 
has essentially 
given 
her 
a 

night 
of 
her 

own. However, 
“Thank 
God 

It’s Thursday” 
has been facing 
rating declines 
as of late. Both 
“Scandal” 
and “How to Get Away with 
Murder” are down double-
digit percentages from where 
they were last season. While 
neither show is in range of 
being cancelled, “TGIT” is in 
desperate need of a hit that 
will help stabilize the night. 
“The Catch” is not that show. 
Even though it has the guise of 
being suave and sexy, once you 
actually watch it, it comes off as 
dull and boring.

“The Catch” follows a private 

detective named Alice (Mireille 
Enos, “The Killing”) who — 
get this — can’t figure out her 
fiance Benjamin (Peter Krause, 
“Parenthood”) is a con man 

who’s been with her to infiltrate 
her company. What a vocational 
irony-driven 
coinkydink! 
In 

the pilot, Krause’s character 
disappears on Alice, taking 
every trace of his existence 
with him. Now, she’s forced 
to confront her former fiance 
conning her as she tries to hunt 
him down.

The first big strike against 

“The 
Catch” 
is 
Enos’s 

performance, as the actress 
barely forms a character. She 
brings little charisma to a role 
that requires a lot of it. She’s 
asked to show emotion, but can’t 
seem to bring it to life. She has no 
chemistry with any of her scene 
partners, even Krause. It doesn’t 
help that she isn’t given a lot on 
the page with which to work. 
However, when you put her in 
a lineup with Ellen Pompeo 
(“Grey’s 
Anatomy”), 
Kerry 

Washington 
(“Scandal”) 
and 

Viola Davis (“How to Get Away 
with Murder”), who consistently 
elevate their dramas with pure 
performance ability, she pales in 
comparison.

“The Catch” attempts to be 

slick in its production, but it just 
doesn’t succeed in any capacity. 
There are purposefully smooth 
cuts and some fun directorial 
moments 
from 
Julie 
Anne 

Robinson (“Pushing Daisies”), 

but once it reaches the 500 
millionth stylish edit, they lose 
their luster. There’s also an 
overzealous score, which hits 
you over the head with every 
single emotional beat. I get that 
Alice is sad that her fiance left 
her, or that active manhunts can 
be intense, but you don’t need to 
have music emphasize the point 
with a complete lack of subtlety.

Yet “The Catch” does have 

some 
worthwhile 
elements. 

Krause, who replaced Damon 
Dayoub (“Stitchers”) from the 
original pilot, actually brings 
a sense of poise to Benjamin. 
He’s charismatic, charming and 
mysterious as a con man. The 
only genuine moments from the 
pilot — like when he asks Alice 
to run away with him before he 
leaves to not have to hurt her — 
come from his dramatic chops 
and delivery.

Still, 
Krause’s 
strong 

supporting performance is not 
nearly enough to salvage this 
show. It tries to be a show with 
sex appeal and smoothness, 
but it can’t recover from its 
nonsensical vocational irony 
narrative or a dull performance 
from its leading lady. ABC 
shouldn’t be desperate to boost 
its TGIT lineup yet, but this is 
definitely not the show with 
which to do that.

Bruder hits game-winner

Wolverines win on 
walk-off to secure 
weekend sweep of 
Illinois-Chicago

By COLE ZINGAS 

Daily Sports Writer

Friday 
and 
Saturday, 
the 

Michigan baseball team scored 
25 
runs 

in 
three 

blowout 
victories 
against Illinois-Chicago (9-15), 
but Sunday’s contest wasn’t so 
easy.

Instead, it required a walk-

off. Facing a 1-1 count with 
runners on first and second, 
senior outfielder Cody Bruder 
nailed the ball up the middle, 
and junior Carmen Benedetti 
dove home to score the game-
winning run in the ninth inning.

“I was just trying to see the 

ball up, and the rest was a blur,” 
Bruder said.

Bruder couldn’t even recall 

what pitch he was thrown, but 
a hard swing brought Michigan 
(16-5) the victory, 5-4 at Ray 
Fisher Stadium.

The game started similarly to 

the previous contests against the 
Flames, as Michigan jumped on 
the board first.

A couple of quick innings for 

senior left-handed pitcher Evan 
Hill and a string of hits from 
the bottom of the lineup put 
Michigan on top, 2-0, after two 
innings. After seeing Michigan 
win the previous three games 
against the Flames (9-15) by 
a combined 19 runs, an early 
lead had the Michigan faithful 
confident about their team’s 
chances.

But in the top of the third, 

an offensive outburst by the 
Flames, including a triple by 
Derrick Patrick, tied the game, 
2-2. In the next frame, Hill still 
couldn’t settle down, and the 
Flames took the lead on an RBI 
double from No. 8 hitter Cody 
Mohanek. 
The 
Wolverines’ 

starters usually pitch deep into 

games, but UIC knocked Hill 
out after just 3.1 innings.

The bullpen, though, provided 

the relief that Michigan needed. 
Freshman 
left-hander 
Will 

Tribucher stepped in to face 
Patrick and forced a 6-4-3 
double-play to end the inning.

Down 3-2 in the following 

inning, 
freshman 
outfielder 

Jonathan Engelmann checked 
his swing and 
was 
punched 

out 
on 
an 

appeal to first 
base. Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich 
immediately 
came out onto 
the 
field 
to 

argue the call.

“C’mon, 

give 
me 

a 
warning,” 
Bakich 
yelled, 

taunting the umpire. 

The ump skipped the warning 

and tossed Bakich, but the 
Wolverines weren’t fazed by 
their coach’s abrupt exit.

“He got us all together and 

pretty much told us that we’re 
going to win the game, so it really 

got us fired up,” said sophomore 
first baseman Drew Lugbauer.

In the bottom of the fifth, 

the Wolverines knocked Flames 
starter Connor Ryan out of the 
game and loaded the bases. But 
unlike the Wolverines, the UIC 
relief wasn’t able to pitch out of 
the jam.

Lugbauer stepped up and 

delivered a single through the 

hole 
on 
the 

left 
side 
of 

the 
infield, 

scoring 
two 

to reclaim the 
lead, 4-3.

It 
seemed 

that was all the 
Wolverines 
would 
need, 

as junior left-
handed pitcher 
Carmen 

Benedetti came in for Tribucher 
and cruised through the next 
three innings. 

“(Our bullpen) is a great 

advantage … especially when 
you’re playing the 4th game in 
three days, and you think you 
could be a little thin,” Bakich said. 

Benedetti held UIC without 

a hit and handed the ball to 
sophomore right-hander Bryan 
Pall with a 4-3 lead in the 9th.

Pall faced the top of the 

Flames lineup and couldn’t finish 
the job. Two leaping catches by 
sophomore third baseman Jake 
Bivens held a runner at third, but 
UIC eventually scored on a two-
out RBI single.

But the Wolverines also had 

the meat of their lineup due up 
in the bottom of the ninth, and 
they delivered.

Benedetti and junior catcher 

Harrison 
Wenson 
continued 

impressive 
weekends 
and 

reached base, setting the stage 
for Bruder’s heroics.

Though 
Michigan 
didn’t 

beat the Flames as soundly as 
it did to start the series, to the 
Wolverines, this victory was 
equally impressive.

“That pitching staff that they 

put out today is one of the best 
we’ve seen all year,” Bruder 
said.

Ryan had only allowed one 

run in eight appearances thus 
far, and the Wolverines tagged 
him for four in just 4.1 innings 
of work.

BASEBALL
Bottom of Michigan 
lineup comes up big

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

It was the bottom of the 

second in the first of two games 
for the Michigan baseball team 
Saturday. With the bottom of 
the lineup coming up against 
Illinois-Chicago, 
sophomore 

infielder 
Drew 
Lugbauer 

stood on third, junior infielder 
Michael Brdar was on second 
and freshman infielder Ako 
Thomas on first. 

Sophomore 
infielder 
Jake 

Bivens, 
the 
leadoff 
hitter, 

walked up to the plate and 
looked out at a beautiful bases-
loaded opportunity to drive in 
his teammates.

But before Bivens could get 

in a swing, a misplaced throw 
by the Flames’ pitcher and a 
fumble by the catcher sent the 
ball all the way to the backstop, 
allowing Lugbauer to score on 
the passed ball. The Wolverines 
led, 3-0. 

Brdar then strolled to third, 

Thomas advanced to second 
and Bivens made it safely to first 
with a base hit on the next play. 

“Our goal at the bottom is to 

get on base for the guys at the 
top to knock us in,” Brdar said. 
“When we get on base, it creates 
pressure for the defense and 
creates runs.”

The bottom of the lineup 

contributed significantly toward 
Michigan’s 
offense 
over 
the 

weekend. In the bottom of the 
fifth Sunday, Lugbauer stepped 
up to the plate with the bases 
loaded and hit a two-run single as 
both Bivens and Benedetti scored.

The lineup looked pretty 

much the same for the duration 
of the series with the exception 
of 
Lugbauer 
and 
freshman 

outfielder Jonathan Engelmann 
switching 
off 
between 
the 

sixth- and seventh-hitter slot. 
Brdar spent the weekend as 
a shortstop and the eighth in 
rotation. Thomas finished the 
series securely in the nine hole 
as the second baseman. 

“We have a good group of 

guys out there, and honestly, 
they’re just fun to play with,” 
Brdar said. “Me and (Thomas) 
in the 8-9 hole, we take pride in 
our job down there and getting 
on base with others knocking 
RBIs and helping us come in 
and help us win games. It really 
relieves the pressure from us.”

The lineup was exactly what 

a solid order should be. Keep 
the highest batting percentages 
at the top, the cleanup slugger 
junior catcher Harrison Wenson 
at number four, and the fastest 
in ninth. 

Thomas fits that speedy bill. 
Deceptively small, Thomas 

has one of the team’s top on-base 
percentages (.426), falling just 
short of left-handed pitcher 
Carmen Benedetti and Wenson 
at .500 and .465, respectively. 
Coming out of the weekend, 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
praised his OBP. 

But Thomas is new to the 

slot, having hit second for most 
of high school. But the routine 
is the same no matter where he 
bats. Thomas has to be fast and 
see the pitch.

“Whatever coach needs me 

to do, I’ll do it,” Thomas said. 
“When you got a good group of 
guys around you, it just makes it 
easier to play anywhere. I don’t 
think there’s any nerves. I just 
wanted to play the game like we 
usually play.”

Bakich has enough skill on his 

team to fill the sixth through ninth 
holes with reputable players, but 
Lugbauer, Englemann, Brdar and 
Thomas are confirming their 
claim to the rotation. 

After Sunday’s game-winning 

hit by senior centerfielder Cody 
Bruder, Lugbauer was waiting in 
the wings to take over, something 
that gives the top of the rotation 
conviction in its game.

“All these guys up and down 

can put the ball in the gap at 
any time and have hard at-bats,” 
Bruder said. “It gives you 
confidence, because hitting is 
contagious. I can’t speak enough 
about those guys, to be honest.”

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Red Berenson should stay one more year
I

n 32 years at the helm of the 
Michigan hockey program, 
Red Berenson has had a lot 

of teams — 
some great 
ones, some 
good ones and 
some not-so-
good ones.

He spoke 

consistently 
throughout 
this season 
as if he knew 
he had a good 
team, right up 
until that team gave everything 
it had before losing to No. 1 seed 
North Dakota in the regional 
final in Cincinnati on Saturday.

But I’m guessing that for 

all Berenson knows about this 
year’s team, he knows next 
year’s could be even better.

And that’s why the 76-year-

old Michigan hockey coach 
should return for one more year 
— to lead that team. He loves to 
coach seniors, and he could have 
nine of them next year.

Berenson has been signing 

one-year contracts since 2009, 
and with three straight missed 
NCAA Tournaments, it hasn’t 
always been easy. This year, 
his team put it all together, and 
after that, it’s clear he’s still 
the right man for the job. For 
as difficult as their regional, 
dubbed the “Region of Death,” 
was this weekend, they almost 
escaped it.

Berenson proved, though, 

that he can still lead his team 
into the elite tier of college 
hockey. New Athletic Director 
Warde Manuel agrees, and he 
has supported Berenson since he 
was introduced Jan. 29

“I hope that this year is not 

his last year,” Manuel said 
that day. “I hope I get a chance 
to be here and to watch his 
team on ice again. But if he 
decides that this is his last year, 
then certainly he will have a 

significant role in the process.”

If Berenson decides to 

retire this year, Manuel 
will be scrambling to find a 
replacement. If he stays for 
one more, it gives Manuel time 
to decide on one of the many 
suitable successors Berenson 
has cultivated — Michigan Tech 
coach Mel Pearson (who was 
Berenson’s top assistant for 12 
years) and current associate 
head coach Billy Powers 
(who has been Berenson’s top 
assistant for the last five years) 
among them.

And, more importantly, if 

Berenson stays, he could coach 
the team he has always wanted 
to coach.

The beliefs Berenson holds 

as a coach go back a long time. 
Once, just before he was set 
to start his playing career at 
Michigan in the 1950s, the 
Montreal Canadiens attempted 
to lure him away to the NHL. 
The Canadiens tried every 
which way to get Berenson to 
fulfill his professional dream, 
a Canadian native playing on a 
Canadian team.

Berenson wouldn’t. Not yet.
“Montreal was waiting,” 

Berenson told the Daily in 2010. 
“They tried to bribe me, pay 
me, and I said, ‘No, I’m going to 
school.’ ”

Berenson told that story 

to one of his players, Louie 
Caporusso — though he has 
probably told it more than once 
— in an airport during a trip 
home years ago.

“He went against the grain, 

and I think that’s why he’s 
become such a special figure 
in hockey,” Caporusso told the 
Daily in 2010. “I love that about 
him because he knows exactly 
what he wants. For anyone else, 
it would’ve been a no-brainer. 
Ninety-nine-point-nine percent 
of people would have taken it, 
but he didn’t. That’s what’s so 
great about him.”

After returning their school 

to the NCAA Tournament at 
age 76, 99.9 percent of coaches 
would retire. He should be 
the 0.1 percent, just as he was 
almost six decades ago.

He came back to Ann Arbor 

from the NHL’s St. Louis Blues 
in 1984 because he had a soft 
spot for Michigan and wanted 
to return his alma mater to 
greatness. That he did.

Berenson has also been an 

enduring fixture in college 
hockey, a perfect representation 
of the ideals of the sport. He urges 
his players to stay in school for 
four years, earn their degree and 
play alongside their classmates.

Over the years, that ideal 

has become harder and harder 
to fulfill. NHL teams pressure 
players to turn pro early, 
depriving Berenson of the 
seniors he loves to coach. Every 
summer, Berenson takes his 
seniors on a canoe trip up north. 
He speaks highly of all of them 
and cherishes the teams filled 
with them.

Next year’s team could be one 

of those teams.

The Wolverines will almost 

certainly bring back at least 
seven seniors: forwards Max 
Shuart, Alex Kile and Evan 
Allen, defensemen Michael 
Downing, 
Nolan De Jong 
and Kevin 
Lohan and 
goaltender 
Zach 
Nagelvoort.

Then it gets 

tricky. The 
other two who 
could come 
back as seniors 
are forwards 
Tyler Motte and JT Compher, 
two cogs in the prolific CCM 
line and two NHL Draft picks 
with professional futures.

If those two stay, Berenson 

should, too. If his seniors stick 

around, he should stick with them.

Even if freshman forward 

Kyle Connor leaves, the 
Wolverines need only find a 
third member of their first line 
to keep it rolling. They will 
again have a senior in the net in 

Nagelvoort, 
and they’ll 
have a second-
year captain in 
Compher.

Most 

importantly, 
numbers-
wise, they’ll 
have nine 
seniors, which 
is almost 
unheard 

of. North Dakota and Boston 
College, the two teams that 
won Saturday to advance to the 
Frozen Four, have four each. 
With the extra experience, 
Michigan will have a better 

chance of making a deeper run 
into the NCAA Tournament.

“There should be a sense of 

urgency in your senior year, 
and that’s when most of our 
seniors have their best seasons,” 
Berenson said. “Even though 
they have been good players, 
we have rarely had a senior 
that didn’t have his best year 
as a senior, and that’s why I 
encourage seniors to stay. I 
think it is really important in 
your development and your 
growth and your maturity to 
fulfill that senior year. It always 
shows up on the ice.”

Now, Berenson prefers that 

his players stay four years, but he 
has said countless times that if a 
player has a ticket straight to the 
NHL (as opposed to the minors), 
“I’ll drive him to the airport.”

Connor has that ticket. So 

did Dylan Larkin, who left after 
one season last year and has 

now scored 43 points — tied for 
fourth among NHL rookies — 
for the Detroit Red Wings.

But it doesn’t always work 

out like that. More common 
these days are cases like 
Andrew Copp, a captain on 
last year’s team who forwent 
his senior season and signed 
with the NHL’s Winnipeg Jets, 
disappointing Berenson in the 
process.

“I just wish he would stay and 

do it right — graduate with your 
teammates and classmates,” 
Berenson said that day. “Take 
this team to another level. We 
lost to a senior-laden Minnesota 
team. Well, how about a senior-
laden Michigan team?”

Yes, how about it, Red? What 

do you say — one more year?

‘M’ takes two of three

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

Seeking to win its Big Ten 

opening-weekend series against 
Northwestern (1-2 Big Ten, 10-18 
overall), the Michigan softball 
team couldn’t be halfhearted 
heading into its final game against 
the Wildcats on Sunday.

After 
the 
second-ranked 

Wolverines 
righted 
the 
ship 

Saturday, a strong response after 
their disastrous performance in 
Friday’s loss, Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins had a clear 
mission for her team.

“I just wanted them to come 

out and compete,” Hutchins said. 
“Sometimes you take a negative 
situation and turn it into a positive. 
I don’t want a team that ever gets 
complacent or lackadaisical, and 
when you win a lot of games — I say 
this every year — you can get soft 
and just think you’re going to win 
because you haven’t lost much. ... 
I want a team that comes out to be 
relentless every pitch of the game.”

The Wolverines (2-1, 24-3) 

answered her call to action in 
strong fashion, wasting no time 
lighting up the scoreboard.

After senior center fielder 

Sierra Lawrence led off the game 
with a walk and senior second 
baseman Sierra Romero reached 
base on an error, senior left fielder 
Kelly Christner hit a sacrifice bunt 
to advance both runners. With 
Lawrence and Romero in scoring 
position, 
senior 
right 
fielder 

Kelsey Susalla did what clean-
up hitters do, smashing an RBI 
double to the center-field wall to 
bring both runners home and give 
Michigan a 2-0 lead.

Taking advantage early has 

become a dominant trend for the 
Wolverines, and it is something 
the team emphasizes.

“A lot of it has to do with our 

energy in the dugout, and just 
having good pitch selection and 
staying within ourselves and in 
our process,” Susalla said. “I try 
and focus on getting my bat on 

the ball and putting the ball in 
play, just knowing my teammates 
behind me will have my back.”

The Wolverines went right 

back to work in the second 
inning. With the bases loaded 
and no outs, Michigan found 
itself in prime position to do 
major damage as Romero walked 
up to bat. Swinging on the first 
pitch, Romero sent a sacrifice fly 
to deep center 
field, but poor 
base 
running 

turned 
the 

routine fly ball 
into a double 
play, 
and 

Northwestern 
tagged 
senior 
pinch 

runner 
Olivia 

Richvalsky out 
at third.

After 
the 
Wolverines 

squandered an opportunity to 
break the game open, Christner 
took it upon herself to make sure 
Michigan extended its lead over 
the Wildcats. With two outs in 
the inning, Christner slammed 
a two-run home run well over 
the wall in left field to give the 

Wolverines a 5-0 lead.

Having tossed two scoreless 

innings heading into the third 
inning, fifth-year senior right-
hander Sara Driesenga found 
herself in trouble after allowing 
a walk and bunt single without 
recording an out. But Driesenga 
battled back against the next 
two batters she faced, relying 
on the defense to bail her out of 

the jam. Two 
back-to-back 
groundouts 
later, Driesenga 
appeared to be 
in the clear.

Looking like 

she may escape 
the 
inning 

unscathed, 
Driesenga 
induced a fly 
ball to left field 

for what seemed to be the final out 
of the frame. But on a sunny day 
in Ann Arbor, Christner lost sight 
of the ball. It hit her glove and 
bounced to the ground, allowing 
the Wildcat runners to score to 
cut Michigan’s lead to 5-2.

Junior 
right-hander 
Megan 

Betsa entered the game in the 

fifth to relieve Driesenga, and she 
pitched two innings of one-hit, 
shutout ball.

Michigan put the game away in 

the sixth, when Montemarano’s 
solo blast to center gave the 
Wolverines a 7-3 lead. Then 
Michigan began to pour it on. 
A single by sophomore catcher 
Aidan Falk and a double by junior 
shortstop Abby Ramirez set the 
stage for Lawrence to unleash an 
RBI double to score both runners 
and give Michigan a 9-3 advantage.

Chasing the run-rule margin, 

the 
Wolverines 
remained 
in 

attack mode. Lawrence advanced 
to third on a wild pitch and 
Romero walked before Christner 
hit a fielder’s choice RBI grounder 
that brought Michigan within one 
run of the run rule.

After 
Susalla 
flied 
out, 

the Wolverines had only one 
out remaining, but that’s all 
sophomore first baseman Tera 
Blanco needed. Continuing her 
stellar weekend at the plate, 
Blanco launched a walk-off RBI 
double to the gap in right center, 
scoring Christner all the way from 
first base to seal Michigan’s 11-3 
run-rule victory.

SOFTBALL
Montemarano 
emerges in win

By TYLER COADY 

Daily Sports Writer

As 
the 
Michigan 
Alumni 

Band rose to its feet and started 
its rendition of “The Victors,” 
Lindsay Montemarano rounded 
third base with a jump in her step 
and a horde of teammates waiting 
eagerly for her arrival.

It was a familiar sight all 

weekend, as the junior third 
baseman 
escaped 
from 
the 

doldrums of inconsistency to 
emerge as the Wolverines’ most 
potent offensive force against 
Northwestern 
during 
the 

weekend series.

“(Michigan 
coach 
Carol) 

Hutchins gave me a tip earlier 
in the week, that if I want to see 
more success, that I should swing 
the bat more,” Montemarano said.

Montemarano’s 
willingness 

and ability to take advantage of 
early-in-the-count pitches proved 
a lethal combination against the 
Wildcats. She registered four 
hits and drew three walks in the 
three-game series.

“Sometimes I take too many 

pitches,” Montemarano said. “I 
wanted to swing and I wasn’t 
looking for the perfect pitch, I was 
just looking for something to hit.”

Three of those hits left Alumni 

Field, as Montemarano upped 
her home-run total to six on the 
season. On Sunday, Montemarano 
smacked two homers — a towering 
shot over left field and the other a 
line drive to centerfield.

“The less I try to hit home 

runs, the more it happens,” 
Montemarano said.

While 
her 
stats 
suggest 

she is a boom or bust hitter, 
Montemarano’s approach at the 
plate is far from one-dimensional.

“My strength coach jokes about 

it and he always says, ‘Doubles or 
dingers or outs,’ ” Montemarano 
said. “I am not trying to be a 

power hitter, and I don’t really 
think of myself as one … but the 
ball happens to be going over.”

Montemarano’s 
newfound 

power stroke out of the seventh spot 
only compounded Northwestern’s 
problems on Saturday and Sunday, 
as the Wildcats simply had no easy 
outs in any half-inning. Senior 
centerfielder 
Sierra 
Lawrence 

and 
senior 
second 
baseman 

Sierra Romero were always on 
the basepaths. Senior right fielder 
Kelsey Susalla hit two home 
runs at the cleanup spot, and 
sophomore first baseman Tera 
Blanco had six RBI on Saturday. At 
the bottom of Michigan’s lineup, 
proceedings got even tougher as 
a newly confident Montemarano 
surfaced as a towering presence at 
the plate.

While her recent power surge 

represents a marked development 
in her evolution as a more well-
rounded hitter it is only one 
component of Montemarano’s 
growing stature on the team.

Though she laments taking 

too many pitches, patience was 
a virtue against the Wildcats, as 
she drew five walks and scored on 
two of them.

A slick-fielding third baseman, 

Montemarano was largely able 
to 
neutralize 
Northwestern’s 

small-ball style. Their leadoff 
hitters employed a bunt- and 
slap-hitting-heavy 
approach, 

but 
due 
to 
Montemarano’s 

adept play at third, Michigan’s 
pitching staff had more security 
when dealing with the middle of 
Northwestern’s lineup.

She’s always been one of the 

most vocal Wolverines, but 
now she’s raising her play to a 
comparable level. Combining 
her 
contagious 
energy 

with 
an 
emerging 
skillset, 

Montemarano is positioning 
herself for a highly productive 
month of April and beyond.

MEN’S TENNIS
‘M’ earns split 
vs. ranked foes

Wolverines outlast 
Penn State at home 

but fall short at 

Ohio State

By JARED BERSON 

For the Daily

In one of its longest matches of 

the season, the No. 23 Michigan 
men’s tennis team fought of No. 
25 Penn State for a 5-2 home 
win. Less than 48 hours later, 
the Wolverines couldn’t pull off 
an upset at Ohio State on Sunday, 
losing 7-0.

Against Penn State, Michigan 

clinched the doubles point as 
juniors Jathan Malik and Kevin 
Wong won on a double fault at 
4-5, 40-40, and sophomores 
Alex Knight and Runhao Hua 
dominated, 6-3, behind Knight’s 
huge service games.

Malik 
played 
No. 
1 
for 

Michigan against Penn State, and 
there was early controversy, with 
both players disputing the chair 
umpire’s calls. Penn State senior 
Leo Stakhovsky became visibly 
upset after Malik called one of his 
shots out, and when the umpire 
confirmed, 
he 
approached, 

screaming 
and 
motioning 

violently with his hands.

On his way back to the service 

line, he threw a tennis ball at the 
wall, and Malik capitalized on his 
opponent’s lack of focus to win 
the first set, 6-3.

After that, Stakhovsky seemed 

to move past his early outburst, 
and he broke Malik at love in the 
first service game of the second 
set and cruised to win the set, 6-1. 
In the third, he broke Malik at 
1-1, and again seized momentum, 
defeating Malik, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1.

Junior Davis Crocker obtained 

the easiest point of the day for 
Michigan, winning the first set on 
a volley winner at 5-4, 40-40, and 
breaking early in the second set 
for a 6-4, 6-3 win. 

At No. 2, Knight won the first 

four 
games 
before 
dropping 

serve, but his opponent, Constant 
De La Bassetiere, fought back to 
5-5. At 5-6, De La Bassetiere was 
awarded a controversial point 
at 15-30 on a ball that appeared 
to be wide, forcing a tiebreak in 
which Knight overpowered his 
opponent, winning 7-0. Knight 
fell behind 3-1 in the second set, 
but broke back when he called a 
second serve out at 30-40. 

Angered by the call, De La 

Bassetiere 
and 
Penn 
State’s 

coaching staff argued with the 
umpire throughout the entire 
changeover. De La Bassetiere 
rebounded to knot the match at 
a set apiece. He broke Knight at 
1-1 in the third set, and went on to 
win, 6-7(0), 6-3, 6-2.

Freshman 
Myles 
Schalet 

grinded out a victory to earn the 
Wolverines their 3rd point and 
extend their win streak at the No. 
6 spot to nine matches.

Sophomore Runhao Hua won 

the longest match of the day, 7-6 
(5), 4-6, 7-6 (5), ending nearly a 
half hour after Michigan clinched 
the match.

“You don’t want to know 

(what’s going on in my head during 
a match like this),” said Michigan 
coach Adam Steinberg on Friday. 
“The big part is that I want them 
to stay a team throughout a three 
and a half hour match.”

The Wolverines dropped the 

No. 1 and No. 3 doubles matches 
to Ohio State on Sunday.

Jathan Malik did not play 

singles against for Michigan. 
Knight dropped his match at No. 
1 singles, 3-6, 1-6, to the nation’s 
No. 2 player, Mikael Torpegaard.

Crocker dropped his Sunday 

match, 4-6, 3-6, against Ohio 
State junior Ralf Steinbach.

Michigan’s win streak at the 

No. 6 spot ended on Sunday, when 
Schalet lost to Ohio State’s Martin 
Joyce, 6-3, 6-3.

Following 
the 
weekend’s 

results, the Wolverines’ away 
record stands at 3-4, and their 
record at the Varsity Tennis 
Center has improved to 10-0.

Michigan falls apart in blowout loss

Colorado trounces 

Wolverines in 

final game before 
conference play

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

For 15 minutes Sunday, things 

looked good for the Michigan 
women’s 
lacrosse 
team. 
Its 

defense 
held 
Colorado 
scoreless 
and thanks to a diving, side-
armed goal by junior attacker 
Natalie Carti, the Wolverines 
held 
a 
1-0 
lead 
over 
the 

Buffaloes.

Then, it all unraveled.
Colorado 
took 
control, 

thumping Michigan, 11-4, in the 
final game before the Wolverines 
begin conference play.

Michigan’s woes began at 

the 14:39 mark of the first half, 
when 
sophomore 
attacker 

Mae Tarr received a yellow 
card, giving Colorado a two-
minute man advantage. Though 
the Buffaloes were unable to 
generate sustained pressure in 
Michigan’s defensive zone up to 
that point, they suddenly found 
new life, scoring a minute later 
to tie the game at one.

Just six seconds later, the 

Wolverines continued to cause 
themselves 
harm. 
Junior 

defender Kelly Kubach earned 
the yellow card, and Colorado 
had another two-minute man 
advantage.

Once again, the Buffaloes 

capitalized on the situation, 
scoring 
with 
12 
minutes 

remaining in the half to take 
their first lead of the game.

“I wasn’t upset with the 

yellow cards,” said Michigan 
coach Jennifer Ulehla. “It was 
really unfortunate.”

Things didn’t get any better 

for the Wolverines after the 
goal. The Buffaloes won the 
faceoff, charged down the field, 
and after setting up for two 
minutes, scored yet again to 
surge to a 3-1 lead.

Michigan 
fought 
back, 

though. Junior midfielder Anna 
Schueler scored off the faceoff 
to narrow the lead back down 
to 3-2.

The Wolverines’ hopes for 

a rally were 
short-lived, 
though, 
as 

only a minute 
later, 
an 

unassisted 
Colorado goal 
stretched 
their 
deficit 

back to two.

“The 

defense 
we 

were running 
— all of our line defenders 
played incredibly well,” Ulehla 
said. “They dealt with adversity 
well. It’s our offense that we 
have to get back on track.”

After entering the second 

half down two, Ulehla made a 
personnel change in the cage, 
replacing junior Allison Silber 
with freshman Mira Shane.

But the decision backfired, 

as the Buffaloes scored four 
goals in the first 13 minutes 
of the second half. Following 
Colorado’s eighth goal, Ulehla 
reversed her decision, taking 

Shane out and 
putting Silber 
back in.

Still, 
the 

situation 
did 

not 
improve. 

Michigan 
was unable to 
establish 
any 

substantial 
presence in the 
Colorado zone, 
and even when 

they did, the Wolverines were 
unable to connect more than a 
few passes away from the net.

Two more goals followed 

after the final goalie change 
to make it 10-2 and the game 
was all but over. Michigan and 
Colorado traded goals in the 
final 10 minutes, but in the 
battle between two three-year-

old programs, the Buffaloes 
reigned victorious.

Despite Michigan’s recent 

scoring 
problems 
— 
the 

Wolverines haven’t scored 10 
goals in a single game since 
March 1 — the team is still 
excited for the upcoming Big 
Ten season.

“If you can’t get excited 

about playing Ohio State next 
weekend, then I don’t think 
you’re a Michigan Wolverine,” 
Ulehla said. “That’s in our 
blood, and we’re really looking 
forward to that and have been 
looking forward to that all year. 
I think from a morale standpoint 
that helps our focus, (that) the 
big games are now coming.”

Still, 
though, 
all 
the 

excitement in the world couldn’t 
cure 
Michigan’s 
offensive 

issues Sunday. And against 
Ohio State, the Wolverines will 
soon be facing a team that has 
won seven straight games and is 
looking to defeat them by even 
more than they by lost today.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Then 
Michigan 
found 
an 

answer from its junior captain.

With 5:33 off the clock in the 

second 
period, 
JT 
Compher 

collected a puck from Motte along 
the right boards. He carried it 
across the top of the circle to the 
point and sniped the top shelf with 
a sea of players in front of net.

With 45 seconds left to play, 

Compher attempted to clear the 
puck through the middle of the ice 
with a backhand. North Dakota 
forward Luke Johnson picked off 
the pass easily, and he punished 
the Wolverines for their captain’s 
rare mistake.

Yet Michigan had one more 

comeback left, and it came out 
looking rejuvenated to begin the 
final frame. The Wolverines looked 
like the antithesis of the team that 
played a late overtime game the 
night before, and they finally had 
the benefit of their first full power 
play of the game at the 13:47 mark.

As the two minutes with a man 

advantage started waning away, it 
looked like North Dakota would 
avoid any danger and kill the 
penalty with ease. The Fighting 
Hawks 
weren’t 
allowing 
the 

Wolverines to set up their power 
play, and things were looking bleak.

It only took one chance, though. 

Michigan established formation 
and rotated the puck until it landed 
on Compher’s stick. The Wolverine 
captain fired and found the back of 
the net to even the game at two.

“JT gave us as good of leadership 

as we had in a long time at 
Michigan,” Berenson said. “When 
the game is on the line and we were 
behind, it was JT Compher that 
kept getting us back in the game. 
His will is tremendous.”

But that was the closest the 

Wolverines would come to the 
Frozen Four.

Less than 90 seconds later, 

Rhett Gardner added another to 
North Dakota’s total with a shot 
from the point, before the Fighting 
Hawks notched a fourth.

And 
finally, 
after 
Racine 

abandoned the net, came the fifth 
an empty-netter from Paul LaDue 
that snuck narrowly inside the right 
post and simultaneously pulled the 
plug on Michigan’s season.

The 
comebacks 
ended 
in 

Cincinnati. And Motte was just 
left there, with his stick in the ice.

MICHIGAN
From Page 1B
Michigan has nothing to regret

C

INCINNATI — The 
buzzer sounded at U.S. 
Bank Arena on the 

Michigan 
hockey team’s 
season-
ending loss 
to North 
Dakota, 
and like 
after every 
game, the 
Wolverines 
emptied off 
the bench to 
give Steve 
Racine a helmet-to-mask tap 
before getting in line to shake the 
opposing team’s hands.

While every Michigan player 

gave Racine a tap, he didn’t 
move, seemingly frozen in time. 
Racine’s head hung down. His 
body stood still.

But after the game Michigan 

played, against the opponent that 
it played, there is no reason for 
Racine to hang his head.

Yes, the Wolverines season 

ended, and yes, Racine’s career 
at Michigan was over, but North 
Dakota was the better team on 
the ice.

While the Wolverines gave a 

valiant effort, the Fighting Hawks 
were just too much to handle.

And they knew that early 

on, too.

“After all our first shifts (we 

knew),” said senior forward 
Boo Nieves. “They were hitting 
us, they were getting shots on 
net, and we couldn’t get out of 
our zone.”

Added Racine: “I think (I 

knew) about a minute in. Their 
pace in the game was way faster 
than any game we’ve played so 
far this year.”

And if it wasn’t clear to anyone 

watching, the shot totals after 
the first period were 24-8 — a 
definitive indication of North 
Dakota’s dominance.

The problem, though, wasn’t 

lack of effort by Michigan. The 
Fighting Hawks were just too 
good.

Not only does North Dakota 

have the second highest scoring 
line in the nation in forward 
Brock Boeser, Nick Schmaltz 

and Drake Caggiula, they also 
have a goaltender who boasts the 
second-longest shutout streak 
in NCAA history as well as a 
relentless defense that allowed 
freshman phenom Kyle Connor 
little room to operate all night.

Combining all that, the 

odds were stacked against the 
Wolverines.

And to add to that, Michigan 

played three and a half periods 
of a close hockey game the night 
before, while the Fighting Hawks 
cruised to a blowout victory.

But despite that, the Wolverines 

went into the break down by only 
a goal, spirits unbroken.

“After the first period, coach 

Powers came in and said ‘Hey, 
that’s the best they’ve got. 
We’ve survived that period,’ ” 
Nieves said.

And while it might’ve been 

the best the Fighting Hawks had, 
they were able to keep their play 
consistently at that level for three 
full periods.

In the second period, the tide 

started to turn for Michigan 
as it tied the game. But a bad 
giveaway by the Wolverines with 
45 seconds left in the period gave 
North Dakota the lead right back.

Even after one of 

Michigan’s strongest defensive 
performances, if not its best, 
the scoreboard still favored 
North Dakota after two periods 
— another sign that maybe the 
Wolverines were overmatched.

Of course, Michigan kept it 

close, even tying the game 8:39 
into the third period.

But North Dakota was 

relentless. Its forecheck worked 
even harder, and it continued to 
pepper shots at Michigan’s net.

And while Michigan boasts 

four lines that can score at any 
time, North Dakota let its four 
lines do its talking, especially in 
the third period.

The Fighting Hawks got goals 

from forward Rhett Gardner, a 
second-line winger, and forward 
Coltyn Sanderson, a third-line 
center, to grab hold of the lead 
for good.

“I don’t think they have any 

player on their team — four 
lines and six (defenseman) — 

that wouldn’t be first liners on 
any other team,” Racine said. 
“They’re a heck of a team. You 
have to tip your hat to them. They 
had a great game.”

There just wasn’t a lot 

Michigan could do.

“There have been some players 

that we’ve seen (that have been 
able to skate with us), but not 
collectively as a team, and I think 
that’s something that definitely 
killed us,” Nieves said. “We’re not 
used to playing teams that are as 
fast or faster than us.

“Speed kills, and if you’re not 

skating faster than the other 
team, then they’re going to 
control the puck.”

After the game, a popular topic 

of conversation in the press box 
was which Michigan players 
would leave early for the NHL.

But for the players who come 

back, the season-ending loss will 
make an impact heading into 
next season.

“I’m jealous of them,” said 

senior forward Justin Selman. 
“They are going to have the 
opportunity to know what it takes 
now. I never got that experience 
until this year of knowing how 
hard tournament games are and 
what these games mean. 

“Hopefully this lights a fire 

under their butt, and they get a 
crack at these guys next year.”

Maybe they’ll be the better 

team next year. But for now, 
Michigan should have no 
regrets following its NCAA 
Tournament exit.

Because after winning the Big 

Ten Tournament, after defeating 
Notre Dame in the first round of 
the NCAA Tournament and after 
going toe-to-toe with one of the 

best teams in the country for two-
plus periods, the Wolverines have 
nothing to hang their heads over.

They were simply beat by a 

better team.

Compher shows composure in defeat

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

CINCINNATI — A walk from 

the ice to U.S. Bank Arena’s 
Dressing Room No. 7 is roughly 
40 steps: through the bench, into 
the metal tunnel littered with duct 
tape, past the dividing curtain and 
around the corner to the left.

That lonely route was the exit 

JT Compher used Saturday night 
to leave the game one last time 
this season.

With just over eight minutes 

to play in the NCAA Midwest 
Regional final, an outmatched 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 
was 

hanging with the top seed, North 
Dakota — the score tied at two.

But in a span of just 74 

seconds, there was one goal, 
and then another, before a late 
penalty and a long empty-net 
score sealed the 5-2 victory for 
the Fighting Hawks.

Compher watched from the ice 

as the final horn sounded and the 
North Dakota bench emptied. He 
skated to console his goaltender, 
taking his spot at the end of the 
handshake line.

Then he climbed onto the 

bench, walked through the tunnel 
and turned around the corner 
to the left. Those 40 steps were 
nearly all the time the Wolverines’ 
captain had to compose himself. 
The rest of his night was dedicated 
to everyone else.

Compher was whisked through 

the curved concrete underbelly of 
the arena to take a seat alongside 
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
at the press conference — two 
spokesmen for a team that had no 
games left to play.

“That’s a really, really good 

hockey team that we just played,” 
Compher said. “I’m really proud 
of this team. To get back to the 
tournament and to win the Big 
Ten Championship, it’s a big deal.

“But right now, it’s tough to 

talk.”

Compher, though, made time to 

talk anyway.

He made teary eye contact 

through 
the 
glare 
of 
the 

spotlights, 
answering 
with 

patient, deliberate speech when 
asked what Michigan could have 
done to win the game and whether 
his team was outmatched.

Afterward, Compher retraced 

his steps to the dressing room 
to join his teammates. He didn’t 
prepare a grand speech, saying he 
preferred to take the time to talk 
to the guys individually.

Roughly an hour after nearly 

willing his team to a Frozen Four 
berth with the best game of his 
career, Compher still wasn’t done.

North Dakota’s captain, Gage 

Ausmus — a former teammate and 
close friend from the duo’s days 
at the USNTDP program in Ann 
Arbor — met him in the hallway 
and the two embraced.

Compher 
flashed 
a 
wry 

smile as the pair chatted in the 
hallway, staffers whisking by 
as they hurriedly tore down the 
tournament decorations.

The conversation didn’t last 

more than a few minutes — both 
players 
had 

places 
to 
be. 

Ausmus 
was 

off to captain 
his team at the 
Frozen 
Four, 

while Compher 
was 
headed 

home.

“I just told 

him good luck 
with whatever 
he does next year — if he decides 
to come back or sign pro,” Ausmus 
said. “I’ll see him on the flip side.”

It must have stung to see his 

former teammate off to his third 
Frozen Four in three years, but 

Compher’s face didn’t betray a 
hint of jealousy.

“(Compher) was our captain in 

Ann Arbor,” Ausmus said. “He’s a 
guy that everyone looked up to — 
that I looked up to. Just the way he 

carries himself. 
He 
does 
the 

right 
thing 

every time, all 
the time.”

Even 
on 

nights 
like 

Saturday.

The 

composure 
was only more 
impressive 
to 

watch because Michigan’s junior 
captain isn’t usually much of a 
talker. 
He’s 
brash, 
supremely 

confident and competitive almost 
to a fault, but no one would call him 
long-winded.

Instead, Compher has been the 

type of leader that creates high 
expectations for the people around 
him with his own performance.

This weekend, he certainly did 

that.

Friday night against Notre 

Dame, after being frustrated all 
evening by the Irish’s physicality, 
Compher 
won 
the 
game 
in 

overtime with a perfect no-look 
pass to linemate and junior 
forward Tyler Motte.

With a trip to the Frozen Four on 

the line Saturday night, he netted 
both of the Wolverines’ goals — 
each of them tying the game.

In the end, though, Michigan 

didn’t have enough. Even with 
the sting of loss painfully fresh, 
Compher understood his new role.

The junior stepped out of the 

locker room as a team spokesman, 
determined — in Ausmus’ words — 

to do the right thing.

When Compher was named 

captain last summer, he took over 
a team lacking consistency and 
a program reeling from a deeply 
introspective identity crisis.

For one reason or another over 

the previous three seasons, the 
Wolverines’ leadership had failed 
to root out a culture of frustration 
and disappointment. Compher 
changed that.

“If you lead the team right and 

get everyone on board, you have 
the chance to be a good team,” 
Berenson said in the week before 
the NCAA Tournament. “I don’t 
think it happens from day one, 
but even in the fall, word was 
leaking out that the players have 
never gotten along better. We just 
seemed to think that this was the 
right group.

“You can’t just create that; you 

can’t draw it up or force it.”

The success this season — a Big 

Ten Tournament championship 
and an NCAA Tournament berth 
— is at least in part a testament 
to the stability Compher brought 
the Wolverines.

As Ausmus headed back to 

his own locker room, Compher 
swung his bag over his shoulder 
and headed down the stairs. 
He 
walked 
past 
the 
North 

Dakota fans lining the walls and 
disappeared into an expansive 
garage — his job complete.

Back inside U.S. Bank Arena, 

the ice was still shining under 
the overhead lights, but the flame 
of Michigan’s season had been 
snuffed out.

As the Wolverines boarded the 

bus and headed back to Ann Arbor, 
there were unanswered questions. 
What could’ve been different, and 
did they ever stand a chance?

But the real question — the one 

that Michigan has been trying 
to answer for three years — is 
to whom the team can turn in 
moments of desperation and doubt.

This 
weekend, 
and 
all 

season, JT Compher provided a 
resounding answer.

Junior forward JT Compher proved his worth as a captain with his resiliency after one of the toughest losses of his career on Saturday against North Dakota.

“He does the 
right thing 

every time, all 

the time.”
