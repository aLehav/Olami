After months of discus-
sions and revisions to the city's
proposed medical marijuana
ordinance, the Ann Arbor City
Council approved the first
reading of the ordinance last
night.
Included in the updated ordi-
nance - which was postponed
five times previously - were
two amendments proposed by
Council members Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) and Sandi Smith
(D-Ward 1). The changes con-
cerned medical marijuana
packaging and how the current
estimated 15 medical marijuana
dispensaries in the area would
be relicensed under the new
ordinance.
Democratic Mayor John
Hieftje said the council will
have a second reading on the
ordinance next month.
In regard to the packaging of
medical marijuana, the weight
of the medicine and the appli-

sidered. Briere said this method
of identification is intended for
record keeping and to provide
a substantial tie between the
patient and caregiver.
Chuck Ream, owner of Med-
MAR Pharmaceuticals Inc., a
medical marijuana dispensary
on Packard Road, spoke at the
meeting and said this method
of identification is better than
other alternatives.
"It's an improvement to use
an alphanumeric ID rather than
our state ID numbers," Ream
said.
Along with these identifica-
tions, the contact information
for the dispensary would be
provided on the package, Briere
said. This allows the patient to
contact the provider with any
questions.
"It's the link between the
patient and the caregiver that's
such a vital thing here," Briere
said.
In addition to the clause
on marijuana packaging, an
amendment was included that

NOVI, Mich. - University of
Michigan President Mary Sue
Coleman and Michigan State
University President Lou Anna

Simon joked yesterday about the
heated competition between the
two universities' sports teams.
Despite the athletic rivalry,
the presidents agreed the Uni-
versity Research Corridor - a
research partnership between
the University of Michigan,
Michigan State University and
Wayne State University - is one
way the universities succeed
together.
"... It's not about a final score

like a sporting event," Simon
said. "It is about us celebrating
the differences that we have and
the way they can collaborate."
Coleman added that healthy
competition between the two
schools and the ultimate collab-
oration they share through the
URC benefit both institutions.
"I think the competition
among us actually makes us
better individually," said Cole-
man to an audience of about 100

business leaders and other state
university officials at a panel
discussion in Novi, Mich. yes-
terday.
Coleman, Simon together and
WSU President Allan Gilmour
and Michael Finney, president
and CEO of the Michigan Eco-
nomic Development Corpora-
tion, came together to discuss
the collaboration of the three
universities through the URC

Many of the University Medi-
cal School's fourth-year students
breathed a sigh of relief after

receiving their placement in resi-
dency programs last week.
Announced discreetly on a
single slip of paper in a plain
white envelope last Thursday on
what is called "Match Day", each
placement signifies the hospital
where a student will work and
complete medical training for
the next three to seven years of
his or her life.
For Medical School student

Lauren Ehrlichman, who plans
to specialize in orthopedic sur-
gery, moving home to Boston
to begin her residency at the
four hospitals associated with
the Harvard Medical School
couldn't be more thrilling.
"Opening my envelope was an
incredible rush of emotion," she
said. "In one day, your whole life

LSA freshman Briana Hatch-
er and LSA sophomore Lena
Cintron hope to become the first
members of the Defend Affirma-
tive Action Party to hold execu-
tive positions on the Michigan

Student Assembly.
To achieve this goal, Hatcher
and Cintron, who are running as
MSA president and vice presi-
dent candidates, respectively,
are running on a platform of
increasing diversity on cam-
pus and making the University
a more inclusive environment.
Their campaign, which will cul-
minate tomorrow with the start
of MSA elections, has been cen-
tered on reaching out to minor-
ity students and individuals who
have felt voiceless at the Univer-
sity.
"Our platform is basically

centered around diversity
because we think that the Uni-
versity needs to become more
diverse, and it needs to pay
more attention to the minority
students and the problems that
are going on and we just feel
that we can help," Hatcher said.
"We can be more approachable
to students of minority descent,
and we can take on the issues for
minority students, as well as the
non-minority students."

Naked Mile runs away

The last day of classes for University
students is typically a day of celebra-
tion. And, several decades ago, students
revealed their joy - through the naked
mile.
Starting in the mid-1980s, students
began the one-mile run at the intersec-
tion of South University Avenue and
Washtenaw Avenue, pass through the
Diag and end at the Fleming Adminis-
tration Building.
Initially, Ann Arbor police turned
the other way, thinking it was a frater-
nity prank, according to a Sept.19, 2006
article on the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment's website. While indecent expo-
sure is a punishable crime, the police
didn't receive any complaints by people
in the city.
Every year the group of runners
grew from the original 15 students

to hundreds, according to the article.
Every time the runners gathered, a
crowd of students lined the streets. In
1999, the number of spectators reached
close to 10,000.
As the number of participants grew,
so did the diversity of runners. When
the run started, only males partook
in the event, but over the years more
females joined, according to the article.
After a few years of the run, the
police began to give out citations for
indecent exposure and disorderly
conduct - mainly for alcohol-related
reasons - which led to dwindling par-
ticipation.
To combat the indecent exposure
citations and pressure from the Uni-
versity to refrain from participating,
students began to run while wearing
underwear, bras, plastic cups and other

articles to keep themselves "unex-
posed,"the article states.
But police continued to patrol the
run, and in 2002, the run was also mon-
itored by a police helicopter, according
to an April 19, 2002 article in The Mich-
igan Daily.
At the time, the University released
a statement to the campus community
dissuading participation in the run.
"Students were discouraged to run
because the event was unlawful, dan-
gerous and an embarrassment to the
University and participants," the Daily
article states.
After only a few dozen runners par-
ticipated in 2003, due to pressure from
police and the University, the event
failed to return the next year, according
to an April 15, 2003 Daily article.

Synder introduces
new budget plans
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder
unveiled a plan yesterday to use
hundreds of millions of tax dol-
lars to reward local governments
that heed his call to cut spending
and consolidate public services at
the expense of those that don't.
Snyder's plan would replace
part of Michigan's tax revenue
sharing program that supports
local governments, which is
expected to have about $200 mil-
lion to give out when the new
budget year starts Oct. 1.
Communities that meet what
Snyder deems the "best practic-
es" standards would be eligible
for incentives, although all would
see cuts averaging 30 percent
or more under his proposal to
" reduce money for local govern-
ments by nearly $100 million to
balance the budget.

Calif. panel weighs

State lawmakers raised sharp
questions yesterday about wheth-

plants can withstand a major
earthquake and tsunami like the
ones that have left Japan scram-
bling to control radiation coming
from some of its reactors.
Even before officials from the
state's nuclear plant operators

tions and safety plans to protect
the public in the event of a tem-
blor, Sen. Sam Blakeslee asked
why Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

Four New York Times journal-

Reporter Anthony Shadid,
photographers Tyler Hicks and
Lynsey Addario and videographer
Stephen Farrell left Libya at the
dusty border crossing into Tunisia
that has been used by tens of thou-

"We're overjoyed to report that
our four journalists missing in

Turkey, acting on a U.S.

UNITED NATIONS
Libyan request for
emergency meeting
rejected by U.N.
The U.N. Security Council yes-

for an emergency meeting to halt
what it called "military aggres-
sion" by France and the United
States, but the council will get a
briefing on Libya Thursday from
the secretary-general.
Council members held closed-
door discussions in response
to a letter dated Saturday from
Libyan Foreign Minister Musa
Kousa who claimed that "an
external conspiracy was target-
ing ... (Libya) and its unity and
territorial integrity."
According to the letter,
obtained by The Associated
Press, Kousa accused France
and the U.S. of bombing "several
civilian sites" in violation of the
U.N. Charter and called for "an
emergency meeting in order to
halt this aggression."

The LSA juniors' main campaign
platforms include making MSA
more transparent and to better
encompass the interests of the
majority of the studentbody.
Cintron said one of her main
goals if elected MSA vice presi-
dent will be to facilitate a sense
of unity on campus by bridging
gaps between student groups.
"You come to the University
to learn about other cultures and
learn about the world and see
things from other peoples' per-
spectives," Cintron said. "And
it seems as though the Univer-
sity is pretty segregated, and
people seem to stay in their own
groups."
To improve the campus cli-
mate at the University, Cintron
also said she hopes to address the
issue of minority retention.
"(It's) a very serious issue
at the University of Michigan
because even if you are lucky
enough to be accepted here, you
don't necessarily feel as though
you're welcome here," she said.
"I know a lot of minority stu-
dents who ... feel very isolated
wh=gjLrst getting to campus and,
throughout the whole college
experience."
This academic year, underrep-
resented minority students com-
prise 10.6 of freshmen students
- an increase from 9.1 percent
for the 2009-2010 academic year.
Though this rise may be attrib-
uted partly to a change in the
reporting of students' ethnici-
ties, this percentage increase is
the first since 2003.
To increase the number of
minority students at the Univer-
sity, Hatcher said, if elected, she
would work to expand outreach
efforts to high school students so
they can see the University as an
accepting place.
"I just want to be able to
change (the University climate)
so that when I talk to a high
school student, they can say, 'Oh
yeah, University of Michigan,

earthquake in 1964 and the Kobe
earthquake in 1995 prompted
Japan to make safety improve-

to increase as a result of the events
the'64 and'95 earthquakes.
Rieko Kage, a Toyota Visiting
Professor of Japanese Studies at
the University and an associate
professor of political science at the
University of Tokyo, drew com-
parisons between the Kobe earth-
quake and this month's Tohoku
earthquake. She determined
three factors that are necessary
for recovery: economic resources,
state assistance and social net-
works.
In addition, William Martin, a
professor of nuclear engineering
and radiological sciences at the
University, and Jeroen Ritsema, a
Henry Pollack Endowed Profes-
sor of Geological Sciences at the
University, discussed the scientific

aspects of the earthquake.
Martin detailed the conse-
quences of the explosion at the
Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant
right after the tsunami hit. Japan
has 55 reactors in total, and six of
these were in the vicinity of the
quake, he said, adding that the
radiation levels have been small.
"(The) most likely outcome is
that the reactors will continue to
be cooled and the spent fuel pools
will be stabilized soon," Martin
said.
With a magnitude of 9.0,
Japan's earthquake is the fifth-
largest recorded earthquake in the
past hundred years, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey.

promote this strength, which is a
real asset to the state," Coleman
said.
Coleman commented on how
the current state budget cuts fac-
ing Michigan's public universi-
ties might affect the URC. With
the proposed 15-percent reduc-
tion to higher education funding
- as outlined in Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder's budget - Coleman
said innovation is needed now
more than ever.
"Clearly the economic times of
the state are such that we know
that there has to be new activ-
ity," Coleman said. "We have to
attract talent, we have to keep
talent, we have to provide ways
for the companies to interact
with the universities, we have to
provide the opportunity for stu-
dents to learn how to be entre-
preneurial, we've got to promote
innovation because that's going
to be the 21st century economy of
Michigan."
During the talk, Coleman dis-
cussed several important mile-
stones the URC has made in the
past year.
The URC partnered with
Business Leaders for Michigan
this fall to launch Accelerate
Michigan Innovation Competi-
tion, a competition which aimed
to make Michigan one of the
foremost states for economic
development. Additionally, the
corridor generated more than
$1.6 billion in research activity
in the past year, which brought
$917 million in federal funds to
Michigan. The URC also brings
in 93 percent of research and
development funding from out-

side the state.
Gilmour said the URC is
expanding what the universi-
ties develop in terms of research,
which he stressed isn't just high-
tech research.
Reaching out to students is
also an important aspect of the
URC, Coleman said, adding that
there has been a lot of student
interest in the entrepreneur-
ship programs. She also noted
her surprise that 15 percent of
incoming University students
last year had started their own
businesses in high school.
However, Coleman stressed
that the URC isn't just for busi-
ness students.
Simon said the three universi-
ties form a triangle of collective
resources that make it easier for
businesses to connect with stu-
dents and faculty. Coleman added
that the universities used to con-
duct the same work separately,
but the URC allows for a more
efficient collaboration today.
Gilmour said Michigan's
public universities currently
rank 42nd in the country in the
amount of state funding they
receive. Simon added that one
of the ways the universities can
seek to stay financially afloat is
by working together through
URC projects, for example.
State universities could tell
by the status of state revenue
in recent years that there was
going to be a "day of reckoning,"
Coleman said, adding that she
is proud of the way the Univer-
sity of Michigan community has
stepped up to shoulder the eco-
nomic burden.
Though the University will
continue to construct new
campus buildings and pioneer
research and entrepreneur-
ial projects, Coleman said this
might be at a slower pace than in
the past.
"We understand the reality,
but we also understand that (Sny-
der) believes deeply in higher
education," Coleman said. "And
we believe that when the state
revenues turn around, there will
be more investment in higher
education across the board."

EPA must have power to limit carbon emissions
s it irony or just business as usual when a government
agency is prevented from performing the functions it
was established for? This is what might happen to the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A new bill, the Ener-
gy Tax Prevention Act, moving through Congress would keep
the EPA from regulating carbon dioxide emissions of power
plants and oil refineries. While the bill addresses some eco-
nomic concerns, if passed it would render the EPA almost
completely unable to monitor dangerous greenhouse gases.

A U.S. House committee passed a bill last
Tuesday to prevent the EPA from regulating
the amount of C02 produced by power plants
and oil refineries. The bill will now move to
the House, where it will likely pass.
Scientific data offered by the Carbon Diox-
ide Information Analysis Center, indicates
that atmospheric CO2 concentrations haven't
increased significantly in the 850 years pre-
ceding the Industrial Revolution. But since the
onset of the Industrial Revolution in 1850, CO2
concentrations increased by about 40 percent,
accordingto a Jan. 12 New York Times article.
Since this increase has been directly linked to
the environmental threat of global warming,
it's highly irrational to limit the powers of the
federal agency that's responsible for prevent-
ing a potential catastrophe.
Even worse, coal power plants supply
almost half the consumed electricity in the
U.S., and coal emits the highest CO2 concen-
trations of any known fuel. Essentially, the
House committee has decided to stick with
the status quo by keeping gas and electricity
cheap and precluding the EPA from taking
measures that would encourage the search for
affordable, alternative fuels. Climate models
show that the Earth's temperature could rise
as much as 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the end
of the 21st century. Clearly, this isn't a problem
that can be ignored, but that's precisely what

this bill intends to do.
. It's true that the rapidly rising costs of fuel
represent a profound economic problem. But
in this case, the livelihood of our entire planet
trumps short-term financial comfort. Our
country is responsible for 30 percent of green-
house gas emissions, and Americans have
greater emissions per capita than almost any
other nation. So far, our government has taken
swift steps to reverse global warming, and
companies like BP have responded positively.
In spite of their huge environmental disaster
with last summer's massive oil spill, BP has
invested in wind power, solar power and car-
bon capture interests. If the government sets a
precedent by protecting companies that cause
global warming, they'll discourage the initia-
tives by the companies that seek alternative
fuel sources.
Congressman Fred Upton (R-Mich.)
claims that the Energy Tax Prevention Act
he's sponsoring will rein in the federal gov-
ernment and ensure that the EPA doesn't
inhibit "free enterprise and personal 'lib-
erty." That seems to be a rather forgiving
description of energy industries whose prac-
tices have traded our health and safety for
financial interests for over a century. This
bill should be rejected by the House to indi-
cate Congress's commitment to environmen-
tal responsibility.

down, sportswriters across

One of the common ways that peo-

this question: "Which player, if sub-
tracted from his team, would cause
his team to suffer the most?" In other
words, who is the most valuable to
his team? This seems to be logical.
After all, the award has the phrase
"most valuable" in it. This year, if you
were to answer that question, the
player would probably be either Dirk
Nowitzki or Derrick Rose. For Now-

The price of war

'Empower' ealth care innovation

With the impending year-end withdrawal
of our remaining troops from Iraq, it seems to
be an appropriate time to discuss the excessive
nature of the United States's defense spending.
As of now, the U.S. spends about 10 times more
on its military than other leading countries in
terms of raw dollars - about $664 billion last
year - and is second only to the United Arab
Emirates in per capita defense spending at
$2,141 per citizen in 2009.
There are several reasons why such exorbi-
tant spending is unnecessary. For starters, the
U.S. - with a stockpile of 8,500 nuclear war-
heads as of 2010 - is well equipped to manage
any conceivable global cataclysm. The prin-
ciple of mutual assured destruction asserts
that the incidence of a nuclear war is highly
unlikely between countries with extensive
nuclear proliferation, so it goes without say-
ing that these countries are also unlikely to be
severely provoked by countries without weap-
ons of mass destruction caches.
Even in the absence of a nuclear attack, war
on a smaller scale is still a prevalent threat, but
recent wars have been anything but money
well spent. Our country's most expensive
military efforts in the past 40 years - the
Vietnam, Korean, Afghanistan and Iraq wars
- have been wasteful, imperialistic attempts
to force democracy on nations that the U.S.
doesn't depend heavily upon for economic
stability. In addition to causing thousands of
needless deaths, these wars have added to a
national debt that will exceed a staggering $15
trillion by the year's end.
The public's disapproval of these recent
U.S. military efforts necessitates a reevalua-
tion of our defense budget. Currently, much of
the budget is dedicated to "Overseas Contin-
gency Operations" - a diversionary term for
the War on Terror. In other words, it's squan-
dered to provide us with the illusion of safety
against a nameless, faceless enemy while our
government pursues long-term foreign policy
objectives which we aren't given adequate
information about.
But there's at least enough information
to show us how damaging these "Contin-
gency Operations" have been to our econ-
omy. According to the war budget clock on
costofwar.com, the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars alone have cost our nation more than
$1.1 trillion since 2001, and that's not even

counting the interest we owe on debts from
past wars.
We don't reserve wasteful spending solely
for wartime, either. Political theorists have
been debating our national obsession with a
"permanent war economy" since the end of
World War II. Essentially, the U.S. has main-
tained a high level of military spending in war
and peace because it benefits corporate inter-
ests and stimulates the economy. But couldn't
that money be used to fund jobs in govern-
ment sectors that don't promote death and
destruction?
If the military budget is restructured to pre-
vent additional waste, it will free up funds for
plenty of other eligible initiatives. For exam-
ple, the expenses of Social Security, Medicare
and Medicaid are rapidly growing to manage
increasing numbers of elderly and other wel-
fare beneficiaries. Cutting the defense bud-
get could be a solution to this problem. Not
to mention, extra money might also be used
for improvements to national infrastructure,
environment friendly technologies and insti-
tutions of higher education.
And if military interests are still a compel-
ling concern, why not emphasize domestic
defense spending over the invasion and occu-
pation of foreign countries? It's much cheaper
to protect our interests at home than it is to
funnel money to a war effort on the other side
of the globe.
Yes, it's true that strategic imperialism and
military competition are sometimes neces-
sary as a preemptive defense measure, but not
always. This month, a report by The Guard-
ian indicated that the informant (code name
"Curveball"), whose WMD tips provided
much of the United States's justification for
the Iraq War, fabricated his claims. The inter-
view confirmed the longstanding suspicion
that the eight-year war was a needless waste
of manpower and public funds.
But instead of crying over spilt milk, the
politically active should force a debate to
encourage a significant reduction in military
spending. A frugal, prudent military bud-
get should replace our monolithic military-
industrial complex until a justifiable conflict
mandates added funding - extra emphasis on
"justifiable."

Attacks targeting the Democrats' health care law
passed last year have intensified as Republicans have
taken control of the United States House of Representa-
tives. A complete repeal - which failed in the Senate but
passed the House - was even attempted last month. To
make matters worse, conservative judges from Virginia
and Florida ruled the vital portion of the law mandat-
ing individuals to buy insurance unconstitutional, set-
ting the stage for a review of the law by an unpredictable
Supreme Court. It's clear the legislation is beingtargeted
from all angles.
But the "Empowering States to Innovate Act," which
was introduced Feb. s by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and is
officially backed by the Obama administration could help
preserve the reforms. The bill amends the healthcare law
by "accelerating State Innovation Waivers," which means
states may be granted exemptions from key provisions
of the bill - like the individual coverage mandate and
required establishment of health insurance exchanges
- beginning in 2014 rather than 2017. The catch is that
states will have to find alternative reforms that work just
as well. Accordingto a Feb. 28 White House press release,
proposals different from the law can be implemented as
long as they provide coverage that is "at least as compre-
hensive ... at least as affordable ... to at least as many resi-
dents" and don't increase the federal deficit. Maine has
already been granted a kind of waiver for one regulation,
but it's only a temporary exemption that addresses con-
cerns specific to the state's insurance market.
This is a brilliant political move by the Obama admin-
istration - it staves off some political opposition by
averting potential wider-ranging attacks aimed at the
structure ofthe law and sends the messagethat the White
House is willing to compromise. Not surprisingly then,
senators across the political spectrum have embraced
the waiver idea. Self-described Democratic Socialist Sen.
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) - whose state is in the process
of attempting to institute a European style single-payer
system - originally inserted the provision into the leg-
islation. On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Scott Brown
(R-Mass.) - though he ran his election campaign on
blocking health reform - is a cosponsor of the proposal
to move the waiver date forward.
Setting aside the proposal's political appeal, moving
the state waiver eligibility date forward could expose
alternative and more efficient ideas to accomplish the
reform goals of the administration. The president has
even admitted the current reform package isn't perfect,
so allowing states some flexibility to implement their

own policy preferences would allow for comparisons of
efficacy between different methods. For example, if Ver-
mont puts single-payer into place, its outcomes could be
juxtaposed and contrasted with the individual mandate
and insurance exchange system called for under the fed-
eral reform. As a consequence, the health care debate will
become more substantive - governors are goingto have
to supporttheir criticism of the federal law by developing
innovative policies that satisfy tangible health care qual-
ity and affordability benchmarks.
It appears then, that Republicans shouldn't have
any trouble getting on board with this proposal - it's a
reasonable challenge that could reveal effective policy
solutions, both liberal and conservative, right? But The
Wall Street Journal expressed its doubts in a March 3
article. The paper labels reform goals - which include
universal coverage and affordability - as "liberal pri-
orities" that rule out "market oriented" reforms like
tax credits to purchase insurance and high deductible
or value-based plans. The WSJ contends that liberals
"think they havea monopoly on good ideas." So basical-
ly, the rebuttal is that near-universal coverage and the
administration's apparently unreasonable definition of
"affordability" - which is too lenient - aren't possible
through "market-based" solutions but will instead lead
to greater centralization.
As the criticism moves beyond policy solutions to
question the premises of health reform, it doesn't carry
the same robust public appeal that came with calls to
"repeal." Voters didn't take issue with the goals of health
reform - the bill was unpopular because it was falsely
tagged as a "government takeover of health care," not
because of its regulations banning discrimination with
respect to preexisting conditions and promises of greater,
more comprehensive coverage.
Though The Wall Street Journal's analysis seems more
like a rationalization for political criticism than anything
else, what if it's right that the paper's definition of "mar-
ket-based" reforms are impossible under the adminis-
tration's guidelines? Maybe, then, those policy solutions
aren't appropriate for what Americans want from their
health care system.
Health care reform is going to be an evolving process,
and if it's going to be a bipartisan effort, there has to be
some compromise. President Barack Obama at least one
Republican, Scott Brown, have made an effort to reach
across the aisle - it's time for others to join them.

ANN ARBOR FILM FESTIVAL
A2 festival turns 49

ANN ARBOR FILM FESTiVAL
Professor documentarians

By JENNIFER XU
Senior Arts Editor

Weeklong film
festival starts today
at the Michigan
By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Art Writer
This week marks the 49th year
of one of the most renowned exhi-
bitions of experimental film in the
country. The Ann Arbor Film Fes-
tival has featured many notable
contributors through the years,
ranging from artists like Andy
Warhol to seasoned filmmakers
like Gus Van Sant. Today through
Sunday, the festival will continue
in its tradition of promoting film
as an aesthetic medium.
Established in 1963 by Univer-
sity professor George Manupel-
li, the festival is the oldest
experimental film festival and
third-oldest film festival in the
country. It quickly grew from
a fledgling dream overseen by
the University, showing films
exclusively in 16mm format, into
an independent showcase with
high-quality digital media and
thousands of entries from inter-
national filmmakers.
To kick off a presentation of

188 films and other performanc-
es, this year's festival will fea-
ture the world premiere of "The
Florestine Collection" tonight at
8:15 p.m. in the Michigan The-
ater. Started by the late experi-
mental animator Helen Hill as a
film about a dressmaker in New
Orleans, "The Florestine Col-
lection" was completed by Hill's
husband after she passed away.
The following days of the
festival will feature screenings
with an established theme. One
is "Always Elsewhere," a col-
lection of five films showing on

Thursday night. Another is the
"Safe As Milk" collection slated
for Saturday morning, which will
offer showings that are suitable
for younger viewers.
Unlike Sundance and Cannes,
the AAFF is a unique opportu-
nity to delight in avant garde
works that may never be seen
by a national audience. The first
showing on Tuesday will follow
an introductory reception with
a DJ, an open bar and appetiz-
ers from local eateries. The
reception costs $30 and includes
admission to the screening.

Too much cyber litter on Twitter

Jwas stuck in the Newark
Airport last week for an
ungodly amount of time,
when I came across a sign that
drew my ire. It read: "Follow
the Shops in
Newark Ter-
minal B on
Twitter at @
ShopEWRB."
Now, I don't
know how T
much of it
was influ-
encedby my KAVI
travel frus- SHEKHAR
trations, but PANDEY
I mentally
launched
into a Lewis Black-esque rant:
Forget celebrities, news orga-
nizations and ordinary people.
Now entities are having Twitter
accounts? And not just any enti-
ty, the establishments of Newark
Airport's Terminal B - we're
talking the Illuminati of Currito
Burrito, Hudson News and frea-
kin' Famous Famiglia's Pizza.
Did some dude wake up one
day and realize the world needs
a constant update of the goings-
on among the shops of this
specific terminal of this specific
airport? Did they think that
there's a person out there shriek-
ing like a crack addict, "I NEED
TO KNOW WHEN WENDY'S
IS OPENING IN TERMINAL B
OF THE NEWARK AIRPORT!
I'M TWEAKIN'! I'M TWEA-
KIN'!" Oh, and upon further
research, the shops of Newark's
Terminal A and Terminal C each
have their own Twitter accounts
as well. Do you think the three
of them are engaged in turf wars
to see who can gain the most fol-
lowers? God, I hope so.

Quite honestly, this incredu-
lously irrelevant Twitter
account made me feel like a bit
of a fool for being a Twitter
user, and made me reconsider
if I wanted to keep an active
account.
At first, when Twitter started
blowing up over the past few
years, I stayed away. I thought
its only purpose was to tell the
world that you had a tuna melt
for lunch or to be another outlet
for celebrities to say inappro-
priate things - not my cup of
chai. But through the pressure
of peers, I got a Twitter account
- first, only to follow the likes
of Stephen Colbert and Jimmy
Fallon (gotta love 'em), before
succumbing to actually tweet-
ing in recent weeks.
One of the reasons I still
keep a Twitter account is that
it's a one-stop shop for all my
breaking news needs. Why
visit CNN's website to check on
the global situation, then go to
ESPN to check the latest sports.
chatter and finally hit up /Film
to see the what's new in Hol-
lywood? That's clearly too much
work. I just wake up in the
morning feeling like P. Diddy,
check Twitter on my phone
to get updated about Japan,
see the latest March Madness
results and discover that Jo
Go-Lev was just confirmed as
Alberto Falcone in "The Dark
Knight Rises." Our culture is
transforming into one of unlim-
ited access and immediate grat-
ification, and Twitter allows me
to drink the Kool-Aid.
The "trending topics" listed
on Twitter are also nifty, show-
ing what's currently on the cul-
tural conscious. I'd have been

From Page 5
the stigma that often surrounds
student work need not exist. He
mentioned that director Michael
Langan's ("Heliotropes") first
film was in the Ann Arbor Film
Festival when he was a student
at the Rhode Island School of
Design.
"I'm sure if you are just learn-
ing film, it's probably not at the
same level (as a professional film-
maker)," Harrison said. "But stu-
dents really do make some great
films, and it's amazing to have stu-
dent films play alongside the films
of ... influences, to have different
generations working together and
showcase new talents and new
voices."
The Ann Arbor Film Festival
has been uncovering new talents
and new voices, and the student
showcase will certainly continue
that tradition.
"I really want to push people's
ideas of perception and how it's
subjective and how things aren't
always what they seem," Reau-
me said. His film integrates live
action with graphic design.
"It's exciting because I kind
of get to push the line of what is
graphic design," he said. "A lot of

people just think it's a commercial
thing with brochures and stuff,
but (my film) shows that it doesn't
have to be just that, and you can
use it to tell a different sort of nar-
rative. Typography can change
the situation."
Lowe's animated film is equally
ambitious - he did the music for
it himself - but focuses on experi-
ences common to all students.
"(It) kind of reflects my anxi-
eties about entering the work
world," he said. "It's about how
you change yourself and your
behavior in situations. You know,
you're still kind of forming your
personality while you're in school
and it was a culmination of all
those experiences."
Reaume and Lowe are excited
about the upcoming festival and
realize how matchless the experi-
ence will be.
"It's crazy," Lowe said. "(Oscar-
nominated animator) Bill Plymp-
ton's work has been shown here
and now my stuff is shown in the
same festival."
Though the festival could
promise professional opportuni-
ties for its filmmakers, that isn't
Lowe's main focus.
"I really just want to go and
soak it up," Lowe said. "It wasn't
in the plan or anything, so I want
to enjoy it."

University students also train
during medical school.
Fourth-year Medical School
student Latifa Sage Silski is
heading south to The Ohio State
University for her placement.
A Cleveland, Ohio native, Silski
wrote in an e-mail interview that
she is excited about her match,
which was her first choice for
general surgery.
Reflecting on the interview
process, she described her expe-
rience as tiring but at times
humorous, like when she had to
field questions about residency.
"Since the process is so coun-
terintuitive, after every inter-
view, family and friends ask you
if you got the job, and you have to
explain the whole match process
again," Silski wrote.
She wrote that the most nerve-
racking part of applying for
residencies was developing her

match list, which forced her to
choose between two top-notch
residency programs for her num-
ber one choice.
"I think t certified my list sev-
eral times, changing it based on
how I felt on a particular day,"
Silski wrote.
Ehrlichman, also trudged
through an anxiety-filled inter-
view season, meeting with phy-
sicians and hospital staff from
more than 20 medical centers
across the country - more than
double the average number of
formal hospital visits the typical
medical student makes.
On the Medical School's "Dose
of Reality" blog where current
students discuss their experienc-
es in the classroom, Ehrlichman
wrote that interviews would occa-
sionally include hands-on tasks,
such as "suturing wet hot dogs
back together" and "constructing
structures out of clay," in addition
to the typical relevant questions
about her interests and goals.

Ehrlichman said she prepared
for each interview by studying
various topics in health care lit-
erature, but found that many
interviewers seemed to be more
interested in the University's ath-
letic programs.
"Going into orthopedic sur-
gery, you see a lot of people who
are interested in sports (medi-
cine), and I learned early on that
the best way to prepare for inter-
views wasn't necessarily reading
about health care reform, but just
to watch (ESPN) SportsCenter,"
she joked.
Considering the matching
process as a whole, which began
almost a year ago and culminat-
ed in interviews from the fall to
January, Ehrlichman and Silski
praised their mentors at the Uni-
versity for the guidance they pro-
vided duringthe tense time.
"I think every place I went,
the Michigan name carried a
huge amount of weight ... this was
true whether I was in Califor-

nia, the Midwest or the South,"
Ehrlichman said. "I felt like the
Michigan program just prepared
(students) so well for our inter-
views."
For now, Ehrlichman, Silski
and other students will be wrap-
ping up their medical school clin-
ical rotations as their residency
program start dates approach.
Ehrlichman said she will start at
Harvard in mid-June and Silski
will begin at OSU about a week
later.
Despite the stress that comes
with planning for her move,
Ehrlichman said she is taking
some time to bask in her delight.
"I'm just so happy right now,"
she said.
Silski echoed Ehrlichman's
sentiments, writing that she is
excited to be moving on to the
next milestone in her life.
"Even though this is just the
beginning of another journey, I
am allowing myself to enjoy the
moment," Silski wrote.

It's a mental game for
Michigan in St. Louis

MEN'S BASKETBALL
A glimpse into the future

After 30 minutes, Michi-
gan was up 4-0 at Yost
ce Arena on Oct. 2nd.
Forwards Louie Caporusso,
Scooter Vaughan and Matt Rust
all scored
glamorously CASANDRA
in the open- PAGNI
ing game of
their final On Ice Hockey
campaign as
Wolverines. They scored on the
power play, at even strength and
even netted a shorthanded tally.
But, in this critical first game,
the seniors - and the rest of the
team - made a crucial mistake.
There were still 30 minutes of
hockey remaining - a memo the
Mercyhurst Lakers received,
but one the Wolverines forgot
to open. Shawn Hunwick let up
four consecutive Mercyhurst
goals, and the Wolverineswere
lucky to have left Yost with a tie,
as the Lakers won the exhibition
shootout.
It was a mental lapse by Michi-
gan that cost it the first win of the
season.
But so much has changed since
that early season mistake.
The fourth-ranked Wolverines
are currently awaiting a Friday
matchup with No.14 Nebraska-
Omaha. This Friday in St. Louis
marks Michigan's 21st consecu-
tive NCAA Tournament appear-
ance, as the Wolverines are the
No.2 seed in the West region,
with Boston College and Colo-
rado College rounding outthe
bracket.
And for this team to get past
the Gatewayto the West and into
the Twin Cities, Michigan needs
to work hard to get its mind right.
"Obviously you want to pre-
pare yourself for the team com-
ing up, and Nebraska-Omaha is
a really good team," Caporusso
said. "We can't look past that
Friday game. Everyone's got to

very raw, but with another point

HELLO HORFORD: Beilein loves
Jon Horford. The coach said as
much in a press conference this
season. And early in the year, it
appeared that Morgan and Hor-
ford would work a nice rotation at
center, as the two youngsters estab-
lished themselves as the core of the
Wolverine bigs early in nonconfer-
ence play.
Slowly, though, Horford began
to crumble against more elite Big
Ten competition, as his lack of
experience, compounded with
recurring knee issues, made it dif-
ficult for him to find success. But
you still see flashes of potential
greatness, evidenced by his and-
one dunk over Duke's Ryan Kelly in
his two minutes of play on Sunday.
Sure, he has a goofy looking run,
and Michigan fans love to tease
him for it. But Horford is more
athletic than you think, and his
development will benefit the team
tremendously.
If he can work his way back into
a platoon with Morgan, freshman
forward Evan Smotrycz can move
back to the four - he'd been play-
ing the five with Morgan for the
last quarter of the season or so.
Smotrycz is simply too small to
play center, and he appears to play
more comfortably in his natural
forward position, anyway. Chances
are, Beilein would then have to
decide whether to start Douglass
or Smotrycz at a wing (the other
four starters are solidified - Mor-
ris, Morgan, Tim Hardaway Jr. and
Zack Novak).
But regardless of what he choos-
es, options are never a bad thing.
