Court strikes down
affirmative action ban
6th Circuit: Prop 2 Case could head
unconstitutional to Supreme Court

WELCOME TO THE 60s

By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily News Editor
The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled en banc Thursday
that Michigan's voter-approved
ban on affirmative action was
unconstitutional.
The court issued an 8-7 deci-
sion to overturn a state ballot
initiative - commonly known
as Proposal 2, which was voted
into law in 2006 - that banned
the use of "preferential treat-
ment" in state decisions regard-
ing university admissions or
employment on the basis of race,
sex, color, ethnicity or national
origin.
The ruling was made by all
15 judges on the 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals, at the request
of Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette, a defendant in the

case. A three-judge panel of the
6th Circuit Court of Appeals
made an initial ruling against
Proposal 2 in July 2011.
The majority ruled that the
ban on the basis of race is a
violation of the Equal Protec-
tion Clause of the 14th Amend-
ment to the U.S. Constitution
and therefore unconstitutional.
The decision overturns a previ-
ous decision made by the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan at Detroit,
which ruled Proposal 2 to be
constitutional.
The majority opinion was
based on two primary argu-
ments, rested on the argument
that admissions decisions can be
considered a part of the politi-
cal process. Judge R. Guy Cole
Jr. wrote for the majority, argu-

Though affirmative action
became legal again in Michi-
gan on Thursday, the change
may be short-lived, according
to University experts.
The U.S. 6th Circuit Court
of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio
effectively changed Michigan
law on Thursday by lifting
the ban on affirmative action,
overturning the decision of
the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan
at Detroit in the case of Coali-
tion to Defend Affirmative
Action v. Regents of the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
In April, the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Fran-
cisco, Calif. upheld a ban on
affirmative action in Califor-

nia instated by the state's vot-
ers, ruling in opposition to the
6th Circuit. The discrepancy,
according to some, makes it
a near certainty that the U.S.
Supreme Court will take up
the issue of ballot initiatives
banning affirmative action in
state constitutions.
Residential College Prof.
Carl Cohen, a leading propo-
nent of Michigan's Proposal 2,
said the Supreme Court often
intervenes when two circuit
courts issue opposite rulings
on the same issue.
"They almost have to (take
up the case)," Cohen said.
"They're almost obliged to do
so because of the conflicting
decisions in the 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals and the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals in

M CAMPUS RENOVATIONS
Regents approve upgrades
to Earl V. Moore building

Michigan Stadium
also to get $6
million paint job
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Board of
Regents unanimously approved
a host of renovations across cam-
pus, from minor facelift projects
to sweeping overhauls of iconic
structures, at its monthly meet-
ing on Thursday
The largest agenda item
approved by the regents is a
comprehensive $23.2-million
renovation of the Earl V. Moore
building on North Campus. Orig-

inally constructed in 1964 and
the home of the School of Music,
Theater & Dance, the Moore
building has become dilapidated
and inhibits the performance
of students and faculty. At the
University's annual leadership
breakfast on Oct. 30, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
announced the building would
be upgraded in part with a dona-
tion from alumni Bill and Dee
Brehm.
"I know the faculty from
Music, Theatre & Dance will
agree when I say this project is
overdue," Coleman said at the
leadership breakfast.
In a communication with the
regents filed before the meeting,
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-

sity's executive vice president
and chief financial officer, wrote
the building's 21,000 square foot
expansion and renovation will
include a large new rehearsal
hall, lecture hall and music prac-
tice rooms.
Out of the overall $23.2-mil-
lion cost to renovate the struc-
ture, the University will provide
$14 million augmented with $8
million from the Brehm family.
The University will also seek an
additional $1 million fromsmaller
donors and alumni of the School
of Music, Theater & Dance.
"Our School of Music, Theater
& Dance competes for and attracts
the most talented students in the
country," University Provost Phil-

Students split over
conflict between
Israel, Hamas
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK

In light of the escalating
conflict in the Middle East this
week, two student groups held

events on the Diag to promote
peace and raise awareness about
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
on Thursday.
Following the killing of
Ahmed al-Jabari - the military
commander of Hamas, a mili-
tant organization that governs
the Gaza Strip and is classified
as a terrorist organization by the
U.S. government - by an Israeli
airstrike Wednesday, the con-

flict has raised tensions in the
region and grabbed the attention
of students at the University.

Dept. of Energy
lawyer to start new
position on Jan. 7
By PETER SHAHIN and
SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporters
During its monthly meet-
ing Thursday, the University's
Board of Regents approved
Timothy Lynch as the next
general counsel, effective on
Jan. 7.
Though Lynch, the current
deputy general counsel for liti-
gation and enforcement at the
U.S. Department of Energy,
did not attend the meeting, he
said in a phone interview after

the meeting from his home hn
Washington, D.C. that he is
excited for his new role.
"Michigan is one of the
very best educational institu-
tions in the world," Lynch said.
"There aren't many Michigans
out there at all. I don't think
there's really a better place to
go for someone who wants to
do work for a $6-billion client
that has such a strong public
mission. Michigan itself is just
a fantastic university and a
great cultural place."
Lynch said his background
as a trial lawyer and litigator
will play an important role in
guiding the University's legal
matters.
"My vision is to make sure
the general counsel's office is

providing the University with
the kind of high-quality advice
it needs to continue to thrive as
one of the foremost education-
al institutions in the world,"
Lynch said. "Issues that can
come up in the higher educa-
tion context often make their
way to the Courts of Appeals
and the Supreme Court."
He noted his time as an
adjunct professor at George-
town University and the Uni-
versity of Virginia will provide
valuable experience in tran-
sitioning to the field of higher
education.
"I've learned just as much
from the student, if not more,
than what I've taught them,"
Lynch said. "My experience

SUPREME COURT
From Page 1A
ing that Proposal 2 is unconsti-
tutional based on the fact that it
primarily harms minorities by
reordering the political process
and placing undue burden on
them.
"Because less onerous avenues
to effect political change remain
open to those advocating consid-
eration of non-racial factors in
admissions decisions, Michigan
cannot force those advocating
for consideration-of racial factors
to traverse a more arduous road
without violating the Fourteenth
Amendment," Cole wrote. "We
thus conclude that Proposal 2
reorders the political process in
Michigan to place special burdens
on minority interests."
Law Prof. Mark Rosenbaum,
who helped argue the case on
behalf of the plaintiffs, said he
was overwhelmed by the decision
and excited about its implications.
"It's a landmark civil rights
issue," Rosenbaum said. "It is
not about the constitutionality of
affirmative action; it is a bigger
story than that. It's about access
to the political process. It is about
whether or not a popular initia-
tive can cut minorities - people
of color - out of the political pro-
cess."
Rosenbaum said even if the
defendants, including Schuette,
appeal the decision, the ruling
will take immediate effect, mean-
ing the University could choose to
use race as a factor in admissions
decisions.
In a statement, Schuette said
he intends to appeal the decision
to the U.S. Supreme Court on
6TH CIRCUIT

California."
Cohen said the Supreme Court
is not sympathetic to race-based
admissions, and would reverse
the 6th Circuit decision should
they decide to take up the case.
"The likelihood that they will
pick up the case is 97 percent,
I'd say, maybe 98," Cohen said.
"There's no likelihood of their
i turning it down. It's absolutely
made for them -.that's their job.
Their job is to resolve conflict
between the circuit courts."
Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) said in an interview at
Thursday's meeting of the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents that
she expects the Supreme Court to
take up Proposal 2, but is never-
theless pleased with the 6th Cir-
cuit's decision.
"It's a very compelling issue
and I think it'd be a very, very
important development for equal
justice everywhere."
Regent Martin Taylor (D-
Grosse Pointe Farms) said he not
only expects the Court to take up
the case, but is pessimistic about
what he thinks their decision will
be.
"I don't know if I'd say optimis-
tic," Taylor said. "Not with this
Supreme Court, maybe with a few
more appointments by our new
president maybe I can be a little
more confident."
Cohen said despite some out-
spoken University support for
affirmative action policies, he

doesn't expect Thursday's deci-
sion to have a significant effect on
the University's admissions pro-
cesses.
"I think the immediate impact
on the University of Michigan
is nil, except that they will be
watchingverycloselyof course, at
what happens at the United States
Supreme Court."
He added that for that reason,
the University is not likely to take
action in response to the decision.
"The University of Michigan
is very unlikely to re-introduce
preferences only to have the rug
pulled out from them again,"
Cohen said. "So my guess is that
(University leaders) will be saying

ip Hanlon said. "It's one of the gems
of the University and this renova-
tionisverysorelyneeded.".
The regents also approved a
request from Christopher Kendall,
the dean of the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, to name the
addition to the Moore Building as

the basis that the Michigan Civil
Rights Initiative - the amended
section of the constitution that
effectively banned affirmative'
action - is not only constitution-
al, but also approved by a majority
of Michigan voters.
"MCRI embodies the fun-
damental premise of what
America is all about: equal oppor-
tunity under the law," Schuette
said. "Entrance to our great uni-
versities must be based upon
merit. We are prepared to take the
fight for quality, fairness and the
rule of law to the U.S. Supreme
Court."
In order to have the case heard
at the Supreme Court level,
Schuette must file a petition
of certiorari within 90 days of
Thursday's decision.
In his dissenting opinion,
Judge Danny Boggs drew on the
fact that Proposal 2 was enacted
by voters to make his case.
"We have the citizens of the
entire state establishing a prin-
ciple that would, in general, have
seemed laudable," Boggs wrote.
Boggs also wrote in the dis-
sent that the majority's case was
a stretch and relied on tenuous
precedent. He responded to the
majority's assertion that admis-
sions decisions fall within the
jurisdiction of political processes,
contending that such an argu-
ment does not have historical
backing and that Proposal 2 is
inherently not discriminatory.
"Under these circumstances,
holding it to be a violation of equal
protection for the ultimate politi-
cal authority to declare a uniform
policy of non-discrimination is
vastly far afield from the Supreme
Court precedents," Boggs wrote.
In a statement, University
to themselves, 'Let's just see wait
and see how it comes out in the
Supreme Court.'"
Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette already said he
plans to appeal the ruling to the
U.S. Supreme Court. Cohen said
he expects the Supreme Court
to take up the case, despite the
fact that it has already heard oral
arguments for another affirma-
tive action case this year.
In October, litigants in Fisher
v. University of Texas, anoth-
er affirmative action case, in
which the court will determine
if the use of race in undergrad-
uate admissions decisions is
legal under the Equal Protec-
tion Clause of the 14th Amend-
ment, presented their arguments
before the court, which'has not
yet issued a decision.
Many, including Cohen,
expect the Court to rule in favor
of Fisher, at least in part, and
therefore against the use of affir-
mative action.
Therefore, even if the Supreme
Court doesn't take up Proposal2,
the state still may be legally for-
bidden from considering race in
university admissions.
The .state and the University
itself have a tenuous relationship
with affirmative action policies.
Race-based admission prac-
tices began at the University in
1987, in response to widespread
campus activism for increased
diversity.
"Affirmative action" was first
introduced as atermby President
John F. Kennedy in 1961, and first
realized under President Rich-

ard Nixon, who adopted the Phil-
adelphia Plan. The policy, which
required equal opportunity for
minority employment by federal
contractors, is now widely con-
sidered the first major affirma-
tive action program.
However, affirmative action
was slower to hit the University's
campus, and was the outgrowth
of years of protests by and on
behalf of students of color on
campus. The Black Action Move-
ment advocated for increased
commitment to minority enroll-
ment in 1970, 1975 and again in
1987. Then-University President
James Duderstadt responded to
the demands of BAM and oth-
the "Brehm Pavilion" in honor of
their contribution.
Jerry May, the University's vice
president for development, also
praised the Brehms at the meeting
for their support of previous proj-
ects such as the Kellogg Eye Cen-
ter and endowed professorships.
"The Brehms leadership
through this has been extraor-
dinary," May said. "It's been so
heartening to see the Brehms

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said
the University is reviewing the
decision, but because there are
multiple lengthy opinions, it
could take some time to fully
understand the ruling's implica-
tions.
George Washington, an attor-
ney for By Any Means Necessary
- a pro-affirmative action group
that helped argue the case before'
the court - said he would like to
see a turnaround from the drop in
minority enrollment as a result of
the decision.
"It is a tremendous victory for
blak and Latino students and
for the movement that fought
for. affirmative action for many
years," Washington said. "It
means that thousands of black,
Latino and Native American stu-
dents who would not have the
chance to go to our most selec-
tive colleges will now have that
chance."
Cohen said the majority opin-
ion is incorrect in its assertion
that Proposal 2 violates the Equal
Protection Clause because it plac-
es an undue burden on those who
seek preference, adding that the
opinion is based on ludicrous, cir-
cuitous logic.
"The argument upon which
the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals
based its reversal is absolute-
ly unbelievable," Cohen said.
"That's really acrobatic, that the
constitutional amendment that
says you may not give prefer-
ences violates the constitutional
amendment that says you may not
give preference."

ers with the Michigan Mandate,
which began the University's use
of race in admissions decisions.
The mandate was effective,
and minority enrollment went
from 12.7 percent in 1986, to
more than 25 percent in 1997.
Since Proposal 2 became
effective . in December 2006,
undergraduate minority enroll-
ment decreased by about one-
third.
"We're going to reverse that
now," George Washington, a
lawyer for By Any Means neces-
sary - a pro-affirmative action
group that helped argue the case
before the court - said of the
minority enrollment figures.
In 1998, the University insti-
tuted a point system for use to
assess undergraduate applicants,
which awarded 20 points to
underrepresented ethnic groups
and 12 points for a perfect ACT
score.
In 2003, the Supreme Court
ruled in two cases involving the
University's use of race-based
admissions. In Grutter v. Bol-
linger, the court ruled that uni-
versities may use race as a factor
among many in reviewing stu-
dent applications, upholding the
University Law School's admis-
sions process. The Court's rul-
ing in Gratz v. Bollinger, handed
down on the same day, declared
the College of Literature, Sci-
ence and the Arts use of a points
system in admissions uncon-
stitutional because it was not
narrowly tailored to achieve a
compelling interest.
Both cases came after students

who did not earn admission to
the University filed lawsuits.
Barbara Grutter filed suit against
the Law School in 1996. Jennifer
Gratz and Pat Hamacher were
not admitted in 1995 and 1997,
respectively.
With the help of Jennifer
Gratz, the plaintiff in Gratz v.
Bollinger, Proposal 2 got onto
the Michigan ballot in 2006, and
was voted into law. The proposal
amended Michigan's constitu-
tion to ban the use of affirma-
tive action in admissions and
employment decisions.

Later in the day, after the art-
ists packed up their canvasses,
a collection of pro-Palestinian
demonstrators congregated on
the steps of the Harlan Hatch-
er Graduate Library to hold a
peaceful protest against the cur-
rent violence in the Middle East.
LSA sophomore Jeremy Bori-
son - a board member of Ameri-
can Movement for Israel, the
largest pro-Israel group on cam-
pus - helped organize the Spray
Painting for Israel event, which
was scheduled to occur two
weeks ago but was postponed
due to Hurricane Sandy.
Borison said though the
spray-painting event was not
planned in response to the
recent events in Israel and the
Gaza Strip, he believes more
students stopped by to paint the
canvasses as a result.
"Both sides are suffering;
both sides are angry," Borison
said. "We think this is a great
way - even though it's from the
pro-Israel group and can seem
one-sided - we think this is a
great way for people to express
themselves, just show their
emotions."
Though many individuals on
campus have conflicting views
on the issue, Borison said the
murals provided a way for both
sides to come together and
express themselves in a nonvio-
lent way.
"You know we all have dif-
ferent opinions, we all have our
different views, but we really
want to promote peace and pro-
mote unity on our campus in the
future," he said.
LSA junior Molly Rosen, the
president of I-Lead, a pro-Israeli
group on campus, said the graf-
fiti artists represented a side of
Israel not typically portrayed by
the media, adding she believes
the messages they expressed
were extremely moving.

ciated with war and violence,

forward to raising his family in
Ann Arbor. Early in his career,
Lynch was a law clerk in Michi-
gan for University alum Cor-
nelia Kennedy, a U.S. Court of
Appeals Judge, and he said he
has been looking for way to
come back.
"It wasn't a hard choice at
all," he said. "It's just a fantas-
tic university, and I'm really
thrilled to be a part of it."
REGENTS HEAR UNION
RENOVATION PROPOSAL
During the public comments
session, LSA junior Louis
Mirante asked the regents to
consider a proposal to renovate
the University's unions and
recreation centers.
Mirante - a member of
Building a Better Michigan, an

advisory group composed of
students and administrators
dedicated to promoting and
researching campus improve-
ments - said the regents'
opinions will play a critical
role in guiding the group's
next steps.
The $60-million plan would
consist of a 20-year, three-
stage process that would be
focused on upgrading recre-
ational facilities and enhanc-
ing campus unions. During
fall break, the group traveled
to Ohio State University, Pur-
due University and Indiana
University-Purdue University
Indianapolis to generate ideas
for the plan based on the facili-
ties of other campuses. The
group has also worked with
students on campus to gauge
public interest through a series
of polls and discussions.
Mirante said working col-
laboratively with University
administrators will be a key
part of bolstering the program
moving forward.
"We're really trying to be
partners in this going for-
ward," Mirante said. "I think
there is a large probability that
this will eventually be success-
ful. It needs to be successful,
and I think the regents recog-

that than just what you see in
the news," Rosen said. "I think
this is an important example of
that."
During the subsequent pro-
test, about 50 students held
signs and Palestinian flags on
the steps of the library, while
others read poems and told
personal stories of friends and
family living in the Gaza Strip.
Shortly after 5 p.m., the group
held a candlelight vigil, circling
around a collection of candles
that spelled out "Gaza," where
the students prayed and stood
in silence.
One student painted the Pal-
estinian flag on the cheeks and
hands of attendees.
LSA junior Suha Najjar said
she woke up Thursday morning
to distressing Facebook statuses
from her sister, who lives in Gaza
with her mother and brothers.
"She said ... 'I'm really scared,
I've never been in a war, may
God protect us. Goodbye every-
body you may not see me again.'
And she's 12 years old," Najjar
told the crowd of about 200 peo-
ple that gathered to observe the
events.
"Israelis bring their toys to
Gaza and play with us the hard
way," LSA junior Farah Erzouki
said, reading from a poem enti-
tled "To My Unborn Son," which
her friend Nader Elkhuzunder, a
student currently living in Gaza,
sent to her.
LSA senior Joe Varilone - a
member of Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality, the Uni-
versity affiliate of the national
organization Students for Jus-
tice in Palestine - said the dem-
onstrators wanted to make the
point that violence and bomb-
ings will ultimately compound
the problems between Israel
and the Palestinians, not solve
them.
"We don't want a repeat of
what happened in January of
2009 in which 1,400 Palestin-
ians died," Varilone said, refer-
ring to the three-week war
between Israel and Hamas. "I
think generally people (on cam-
pus) are in support of our mes-
sage that violence and airstrikes
nize that."
Though Mirante is opti-
mistic about the project, he
acknowledged that it will likely
be a long-term effort.
"I would not expect any-
thing to happen immediately,
as it shouldn't, because this is
a large commitment," Mirante
said.
REGENTS DISCUSS
GROWTH OF NCRC,
APPROVE $17.5-MILLION
RENOVATION OF NCRC
Nearly four years after the
University first purchased the
2.2 million square-foot North
Campus Research Center from
Pfizer, the building now boasts
a staff of 1,700, an uptick from
the 1,423 employees in July.
To accommodate for the
growing staff and influx of
projects, the regents approved
a $17.5-million renovation that
will account for upgrades to
approximately 68,000 square
feet of the building. The area
will be appropriated for use by
the Medical School.

The overhaul comes on the
heels of a $13.7-million reno-
vation for a portion of the
NCRC used for health services
research, and the University

aren't going to solve the prob-
lems in the Middle East."
LSA senior Ahmad Hasan,
an executive board member
of SAFE, gave an impassioned
speech in which he said the
mainstream media is ignoring
the death of Ahmad Abudaqqa,
a 13-year-old boy killed by
Israeli forces. He said the boy's
death was a catalyst for the cur-
rent fighting between the two
groups, and he wanted to inform
students about this event.
"In this particular inci-
dence, the mainstream media
is portraying, as usual, Israel as
defending itself when, in reality,.
if we look at the actual facts on
the ground, it always starts with
an instance where a Palestinian
civilian was killed," Hasan said
in an interview after the event.
During the event, protesters
held signs that read "Casualties
Should Not be Casual," "Pillars
of Defense' Kills Children," and
"Gaza Strip is Getting Bombed
Obama Didn't Say Shit."
The language used on the
signs led LSA sophomore Adam
Molnar to spark a discussion
with the group of demonstra-
tors on the steps, but he eventu-
ally left the protest. Molnar said
he didn't understand whya self-
proclaimed peaceful protest
would hold signs with words
such as "attack," "ethnic cleans-
ing," "murder" or "bomb" writ-
ten on them, which he believed
was counterintuitive to what
the goals of the group.
"Both sides have innocents
killed, so instead of putting your
effort into trying to get people
to come to your side, why not
put your effort to eliminate the
sides and create one?" Molnar
said.
LSA sophomore Will Schrier
said he was glad that the stu-
dents were willing to demon-
strate their strong beliefs, but
questioned the impact the pro-
testors would have on the larger
community.
"I would like to see how the
demonstrations in the Diag
could amount to something
more, could have a more realiz-
able impact," Schrier said.

Ban overturned
Affirmative action no longer prohibited in Mich.
n Thursday, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals declared
Michigan's ban on the use of affirmative action unconsti-
tutional. The, ban was a result of Proposal 2, a 2006 bal-
lot initiative. The court's majority opinion wrote that the ban on
affirmative action violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protec-
tion Clause, arguing that there are ample opportunities for white
students to get legacy preferences when it comes to admissions, an
opportunity that isn't as prevalent for minority students. Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette said he would appeal the court's-
decision. Though the system of affirmative action needs revision in
order to truly champion equal opportunity, this decision will give
the state universities the means to do so.

Facebook and the Gaza conflict

iles and miles away,
bombs are falling on the
border that runs between
the Gaza Strip
and the state of
Israel. Not on
just one side of
that border, but
onboth sides.
But you might
never know N
that violence
is happening YONAH
on both sides. LIEBERMAN
Starting early in
the afternoon,
my Facebook newsfeed was full of
posts supporting Israel's barrage of
the Gaza Strip. Granted, I went to
a Jewish day school my entire life,
so a sizable number of my friends
on Facebook are ,part of the Jewish
community, meaning the vast major-
ity of the posts on my feed were pro-
Israel. But for others who grew up
with different backgrounds, I know
many of their feeds were pro-Pal-
estine. Clearly, support for only one
side is an issue that pervades both
sides of the solitical spectrum.
On Wednesday, a precisely aimed
missile from Israel killed Ahmed
al-Jabari. He was the military com-
mander of Hamas, the militant orga-
nization that controls the GazaStrip.
Israelis claim he has played a crucial
role in supporting terrorist attacks.
and capturing famous prisoner of
war, Gilad Shalit. Others including
Aluf Benn, editor in chief of Haaretz
- an Israeli Daily newspaper - note
that Jabari was a crucial contact
within the Hamas establishment
who helped maintain cease-fires
between the two.
Since the assassination, more
than 240 low-tech rockets have
been sent toward southern Israel (of
which 145 have been intercepted by

the Iron Dome System) and more
than 100 different sites in the Gaza
Strip have been targeted. Three
Israeli citizens have been killed and
another three Israeli soldiers have
been injured. On the other side, more
than 16 Palestinians have been killed
and more than 115 injured.
As I scrolled down and read sta-
tus after status, my issue was not the
support for Israel - my issue was the
blatant one-sidedness of each post.
Let me provide the oft-repeated post:
"When you hear the news later
today about Israel attacking Gaza
and killing the head terrorist please
keep in mind that 12,000 rockets
were launched at civilian towns
from Gaza since Israel withdrew
from Gaza Strip a few years ago,
about 1,000 this year, and over 130 in
the last 3 days. You will not see that
on TV... Please share."
Those facts are all true. And the
plight of the nearly 1million people in
southern Israel who are under threat
from rocket fire from the Gaza Strip
is real. I've been to those towns. I've
met those people ready to hide in
bomb shelters at a moment's notice.
I've never been to the Gaza Strip.
I've never met the people who've
been affected by the nearly 20 sepa-
rate air strikes. I've never been to the
land that the 16 dead and more than
150 wounded called home. But just
because I've never beenthere doesn't
mean that the suffering in Gaza does
not exist. It doesn't mean I can't
empathize with the families who've
lost loved ones or the 1.7 million
Gazans living in fear of being the next
one targeted by the Israeli Air Force.
Another Facebook status that is
reposted in times like these: "Wher-
ever I stand, I stand with Israel."
This, even more so than the previous
post, is frustrating. It's empty of con-
tent and accusatory to all those who

don't post it, as if I'm not pro-Israel
unless I post it as well.
Social media
only tells one
side of the story.

What's most infuriating about
those one-sided and simplistic posts
is that they don't actually create any-
thing except a narrative of blame. I
understand the desperate urge to
take action,yet I fear negative action
is worse than no action at all. I fear
that perpetuating the narrative that
only one side is to blame will only
draw out this conflict even longer.
Maybe we, in America, can afford
a never-ending conflict. We're miles
and miles away from the bombs
exploding in the Middle East right
now. We've never felt the way the
Israelis and Palestinians feel right
now. Not knowing if another major
escalation is at hand. Not having to
dealwith the consequencesfirsthand.
As a community of smart, active
leaders on this campus, we have a
responsibility to be better than this.
We should break the cycle of blame
and enter one of hope. Just as inno-.
cent Israelis are suffering, innocent
Gazans are suffering. So, instead of
simply supporting one side or the
other, let us come together and sup-
port two states for two peoples. That
will make a real and lasting change.
That will ensure that the people we
care about are safe.

The ever-contentious issue of affirmative
action has been prevalent in the news as of late,
as the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argu-
ments in Fisher v. University of Texas in Octo-
ber which could impact precedent set by the
2003 Supreme Court cases involving the Uni-
versity that affirmed the legality of race-based
admissions. On Thursday, the court ruled that
the ban on affirmative action was unconstitu-
tional. The use of "preferential treatment" in
state decisions regarding university admis-
sions or employment on the basis of race, sex,
color, ethnicity or national origin, outlawed
by Proposal 2, has been reinstated. While it is
quite possible that the U.S. Supreme Court will
set a national precedent when it announces
a decision in the Fisher case this spring, the
6th Circuit Court's decision is a symbolic rul-
ing that acknowledges that some people have
inherent disadvantages and the current system
does not adequately support them.
The use of affirmative action in college
admission should be ultimately oriented
toward the eventual achievement of a "critical
mass" of diversity - a point at which minority
students no longer feel isolated in their cam-

pus environment. One of the crucial disagree-
ments during the Fisher arguments was the
exact definition of critical mass. Consequent-
ly, the University should see the 6th Circuit
Court's decision as an opportunity to create
an exit strategy for an affirmative action pro-
gram and thereby justify its use in the college
admissions process.
However, regardless of how one defines
critical mass, the banning of affirmative
action in Michigan severely hindered the
University's efforts to achieve such a mass -
minority enrollment dropped from 10 percent
a decade ago to 5 percent more recently.
Furthermore, the use of race in the college
admissions process should be only one factor
in determining whether to prefer a student for
admission. Separate socioeconomic factors
also contribute to the diversity of a campus
and should be considered in conjunction with
race. Thursday's decision is a good first step
toward achieving equal opportunity in the
college admissions process, but more must be
done to define the ultimate goals of affirma-
tive action in Michigan and at the University
before its use can be adequately justified.

Food for thought

Welcome to the United States of
America. We've held the gold
medal for "fattest" country in the
developed world for quite
some time now, yet have -
unfortunately made very
few genuine efforts to
remove ourselves from the
not-so-coveted distinction.
In a country where
Mickey D's is located a
mere 10 feet from yourS
local Whole Foods Market, SARAH
a rather remarkable juxta- SKALUBA
position of food cultures
exists. We have the gra-
nola people - those of us who covet locally-
grown, organic meals free of pesticides and
Genetically Modified Organisms - on one
side, and, on the other, we have the consum-
er-driven, mass-produced food culture of big
America - big corporations, big government
and even bigger consequences for the consum-
ers. So is there a happy medium outthere? Can
our nation be health conscious but not overly
regulated by the federal government?
The presidential elections have come and
gone. President Barack Obama was re-elected,
Mitt Romney conceded and things are slowly
returning to a state of everyday blandness - no
more campaigns bombarding us, no more stu-
dents in Angell Hall pestering us to vote and
no more drunken, ideological conversations
with friends about who should be running our
nation. OK, that's old news - I get it. But did
anything else of major significance occur this
past election? Yes. As a matter of fact, some-
thing did happen. The American people finally
spoke up abouttheir health and well-being. So
let's cheer to that, shall we?
But in all seriousness, it was a pleasant
surprise to find so many health-conscious
proposals on the ballots this election cycle.
Though they didn't all pass by popular vote,
at least we know the American people are
starting to take a greater interest in their
health and exactly what they're putting
into their bodies. On Election Day, propos-
als across the nation ranged from whether
or not marijuana has reasonable medicinal
uses to whether certain food labels should be
required in the state of California.
The latter raises an important question
about what we, as consumers, have the right
to know about the food we're eating on a
daily basis. GMOs are used in more than
three-fourths of the processed foods we've

come to know and love. Even raw produce
and soy products are being genetically engi-
neered. Yet here in the ever-savvy United
States, we don't require food companies to
label products containing GMOs, which have
been continuously linked to health concerns
and environmental damage - every granola
lover's worst nightmares.
Nutritional labeling
on food and produce
should be more
comprehensive.
So why am I blabbering on about food
labels and genetically engineered produce?
One: because eating is clearly one my favorite
hobbies. And two: because this actually poses
a serious problem for all of us. I mean, if the
entire European Union, for that matter, Rus-
sia, China and Japan have all imposed strict
GMO policies and required food companies to
label these products, then why is the United
States not following suit? If one state were to
set an example for the rest of the United States,
it would've been California. California's Pro-
posal 37 would've required the entire food
industry to inform consumers as to whether or
not their products contain GMOs by labeling
food packaging.
But unfortunately, this proposal didn't
pass on Election Day. Only 47 percent of Cali-
fornians supported the idea, giving the food
industry the OK to carry out their big profit,
low nutrition mentality. So yes, that may have
been a bust in the realm of public health con-
sciousness and well-being, but let's just be
thankful our nation is starting to move - or
at least crawl - in a healthier direction.
On a more positive note, North Dakota did
ban smoking in public places, making three-
fifths of our nation officially smoke-free. So at
least we'll be able to enjoy our GMO-packed
meals without suffering from secondhand
smoke the next time we go out to dinner. It
may be slow, but it's progress nonetheless.

During the third round of presi-
dential debate, President Barack
Obama reiterated his strategy for
Afghanistan - withdraw com-
bat troops by end of 2014. Part of.
the strategy involves reaching a
peace agreement with the Taliban
before the withdrawal to ensure a
smooth transition of power to the
Afghani government. The prospect
of reaching such a deal, however, is
bleak.
But, the U.S. government is still
determined. As Vice President Joe
Biden said during the vice presi-
dential debate, "We are leaving
Afghanistan in 2014. Period." The
reasoning behind the decision
is twofold: the United States has
accomplished its goals of eliminat-
ing al-Qaida network in Afghani-
stan and there is an increasinglevel
of frustration with the Afghani
administration.
The urgent pressure on the
United States to withdraw has
been heightened by the failure of
President Karzai to curb corrup-
tion within the Afghani govern-
ment. The increase in the number
of insider attacks on Allied forces
by the very Afghan security forces
they've trained has only added to
this pressure. Given the costs the
United States has incurred both in
funds and human lives, these are
understandable concerns on the
part of the American people and
the government.
Rampant corruption is some-
thing that significantly impacts
local Afghans as well. Corruption
has led many Afghans to lose con-
fidence in their government. The
scope of the corruption isn't just
limited to bribes offered to public
servants. Instead, at higher lev-
els, the Karzai administration has
made money from the bidding on
lucrative government procurement
contracts.
One would be amazed to see the
outrageously expensive armored

vehicles traveling Kabul's bumpy
roads. The number of large multi-
storied houses built during the past
few years has also increased. All of
this is happening in a nation where
the average annual income is still
only $425 per person.
Needless to say, much of the tax-
payer money spent by the U.S. in
Afghanistan is misused by the well
connected. To add to the problem,
none of well-known corrupt pub-
lic officials have been indicted for
their fraud.
What's more, recruitment based
on nepotism and favoritism rather
than merit is also a source of disap-
pointment for many Afghans. The
disappointment increases as both
the international community and
the Afghan citizens see that there's
no political will, on the part of the
Karzai government to fix the current
situation.
Despite the international out-
rage in 2009, President Karzai
chose most of the former warlords
and Mujahideen commanders -
some of whom are categorized by
the Human Rights Watch as repeat
offenders - to serve appointed
positions in his cabinet. Even some
of the Western-educated Afghan
technocrats who received Ph.D.s
from the best U.S. universities
and are currently leading Afghan
governmental institutions have
increasingly proved corrupt and
failed to fix the system.
Given this background, any ratio-
nal person should be asking, "If the
elite and well educated superinten-
dents in charge of Afghani govern-
ment institutions are corrupt, then
who can be counted on as a reliable
partner?" That is the very position
that the United States and its allies
currently find themselves in. The
United States has to face a formi-
dable opponent in the Taliban and
the corrupt Afghani government.
And this is largely the reason for
the Obama administration's stub-

born insistence on a 2014 exit strat-
egy, regardless of what may happen
in Afghanistan after the United
States leaves.
Knowing the 2014 deadline,
former warlords have recently
called for a regrouping to defend
the country after the Allied forces
withdraw, which may take the
country back to where it was before
the original 2001 invasion. With
that, the gains of the last decade
that cost billions of dollars and tens
of thousands of U.S. and Afghan
lives will be lost.
The United States is facing
a multidimensional problem in
Afghanistan - be it resurgence of
the Taliban, the corrupt Afghani
administration, the failed economy,
the regrouping of former warlords
after 2014 or the collapse of Kabul
government. Abandoning Afghani-
stan after 2014 is not an option.
The right course of action would
be to withdraw U.S. forces accord-
ing to predetermined schedule and
provide support to the Afghan secu-
rity forces in form of logistics, train-
ing and air support if necessary.
The United States should also
increase or maintain the level of
developmental aid to the country
- at least in the short term. To deal
with the corruption,however,the aid
should be conditional upon meeting
certain benchmarks, such as elimi-
nating corruption in the Afghan
government or bringing fraudulent
high-level officials to trial.
In addition, the United States
along with international communi-
ties - in collaboration with Pakistan
- should force the Taliban to accept
the Afghan Constitution. Finally, if
a peace deal is reached, the United
States should avoid any agreement
with the Taliban that could come at
the cost oftaking awaythe individu-
al freedoms of the Afghan citizens,
particularly women.

MUSK T to r
Tony- winning Classic

'Hairspray' to use
costumes to set
time and place
By ARIELLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
"Hairspray," this semester's
MUSKET performance, is a spar-
kling, stylish stage production

heart as there .s

and shout to
the latest tunes.
Men's shirts are neatly pressed,
tucked into their waist-high
slacks. And without the actors'
saying a word, the audience is
transported back to the 1960s.
The time is 1962 and the place
is Baltimore. Tracy Turnblad, a
turbulent teen with a thirst for
fame, fashion and racial integra-
tion (According to the character,
"it's the new frontier"), turns
the entire town around with her
charm, dance moves and hair-
do.
The '60s were a time of fast-
changing fashion. They were
also a time of image fixation and
racial segregation. "Hairspray"
combines all of that into a full-
length production representa-
tive of the era. The show, in
true theatric fashion, adds some
glamour and whimsy to the peri-
od's not-so-innocent presence.
Yet "Hairspray" proves there
is more to a show than high-
kicks and vocal runs. Winning
a Tony Award in 2003 for Best
Costume Design, the production
tells a story through wardrobe
along with musical numbers.
"Costume goes hand-in-hand
with realizing the importance of
the'decade and what it says about
the real message of the show,"
said Gideon Levinson, an LSA
freshman who embodies Edna
Turnblad in the show.
According to Business sopho-
more Hillary Ginsberg, who
plays Tracy Turnblad, costumes
give a sense of time of day, tran-
sitions and how significant a plot
point is.
MUSKET is one of the largest
student production groups at the

University.
Because of their time con-
straint and smaller design unit,
the costumer designers must
buy and rent a large portion of
the outfits for the production.
By adding embellishments and
altering the pieces, designers cre-
ate a unique look and feel to the
production.
The costumes are also impor-
tant when introducing a char-
acter. There is a scene in which
the "Nicest Kids in Town" are
introduced and Amber Von Tus-
sle, the Corny Collin's show's
self-absorbed star, struts out in
a skirt significantly fuller than
others onstage. The silhouette
is larger and much more notice-
able. Through this, the audience
learns she's a central and egocen-
tric character.
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance Sophoiore, Macken-
zie Orr, who plays Link Larkin,
agreed that costume has a big
effect on how the audience views
a character.
"A lot of times it says a lot
about who the character is out-
side of the spoken lines," he said.
"It adds another layer of under-
standing for an audience or any-
body who is watching."
When it comes to a show as
bold and bright as "Hairspray,"
costume choice is an intricate
process, especially when the
director and costume direc-
tors aim to create a realistic but
equally entertaining world.
"We have struck a very nice
balance between painting a real-
istic picture but then staying
true to some of the bigger than
life, larger than life moments in
the show," said MT&D senior
and director of the show, Will
DeCamp. "So we haven't sacri--
ficed any of the volume."
Style was of the utmost impor-
tance - especially to the Bal-
timore youth of the time. This
notion was utilized in choosing
and designing outfits for the pro-
duction.
The costume designers and
director's goal was to stay as true
to the time period as possible
through costume. Lantz even
goes so far as selecting materi-
als that were around in the '60s.
She explained that they chose
not to use stretchy fabrics such
as spandex because they weren't
invented yet.
"That's why we keep com-
ing back to 'this looks great, we
totally love this, but it's not total-
ly true to the year'," Lantz said.

The looks in "Hairspray" not
only communicate the what and
where of the story, but also intro-
duce and intensify major events.
Lantz even believes that as the
story evolves so does the fashion.
The girls start the perfor-
mance in full skirts and perfectly
pressed blouses. But as the ideas
in the production progress to
accepting people for who they
are and ending racial segrega-
tion, so do the styles. Eventu-
ally the fashion transforms into
sleeker and sexier silhouettes.
DeCamp says that the outfits
that the actors wear represent
parts of the story.
"We're building and build-
ing and building until we have
this culminating moment where
the costumes are just fabulous,"
he said. "But also it's this cul-
minating moment in the story
where we kind of bridge the gap
between two races and two com-
munities that have been so divid-
ed over the course of the rest of
the musical."
Costumes are not only for the
audience's enjoyment, but are
just as important to the actors.
"Its always so surprising how
much more of the character you
feel like when you put on a cos-
tume," Orr said.
For actors, putting on a cos-
tume helps them transform into
the person they're supposed
to be. For Levinson, it not only
transforms him into who the
character is, but what the charac-
ter is - a mother.
"Hairspray" camps it up by
having Tracy's hefty mother
portrayed by a man. It's surely
meant for comic relief, but for
the actor playing the role, com-
edy is not the first thing on his
mind.
Levinson says the costumes
are necessary for him to get into
character and let it all out.
"It's one thing to shimmy
when you're dancing, but when
you're shimmying with big
boobs, it's much easier to go
crazy," he said.
The costumes parallel the
exhilaration of "Hairspray" 's big
and bold, Broadway-sized num-
bers. Songs such as "You Can't
Stop the Beat" exude but also
bring the audience down to earth
with everyday wear in the less
spectacular times. They also show
an importance and personality of
a character before the story can.
But mostly, the costumes from
"Hairspray" want to welcome us
to the '60s.

"The Details,"

Frustrated and generally
unhappy with his marriage, Jeff
Lang (Tobey Maguire, "Spider-
Man") is driven to cheat on his
wife (Elizabeth Banks, "Zack
and Miri Make a Porno") after
an argument aboutthe raccoons.
From there, "The Details" heads
down a twisted path that finds
Jeff dealing with a neighbor off
her rocker, watching $75,000
of his own money rain off of a
bridge, donating a kidney and
fantasizing about murder via
bow and arrow, ending with Jeff
facing the daunting task of own-
ing up to his actions and accept-
ing the consequences.
At one point, a piano literally
falls on Maguire's head. There
couldn't be a better metaphor for
what he experiences through-
out the film, except perhaps,
for Maguire stepping in front
of an 18-wheeler. Jeff willfully
places himself in self-defeating
situations, which are doomed to
spawn poor results. His inability
to give up his efforts to deceive

This is the Brazilian pop star's
52nd album, and his discography
includes five platinum albums
and 12 gold records. Gil has won
seven Grammy Awards during a
career spanning nearly 50 years,
the most recent for 2005's Ele-
tracistico.
Gil turned 70 in June, but
there's no sign of him slowing
down yet. Gil remains the art-
ist that he was in the 1960s, '70s
and so on, sponging up cultural
influences and infusing them into
his experimental and constantly
changing style of music.
"I wouldn't put him under any
single label," said Christi-Anne
Castro, a Musicology professor
in the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance who will be speaking at an
Arts & Eats event prior to the per-
formance. "It's better to call him
a great musical innovator ... you
couldn't give him a single genre,"
she said of Gil.
Gil is perhaps most famous for
his participation with the Trop-

during Brazil's military dictator-

The orchestra's upcoming fall
concert, "Pops Takes Flight" -
to be performed at the Michigan
Theateron Sunday - is exactly
what it sounds like: a tribute to
everything light, airy and upbeat
about air travel and flying.
"Flight is a really good theme
for this concert for many rea-
sons," said Jennifer Wei, an LSA
senior and external publicity
coordinator for the orchestra.
"We really wanted to capture,
first-off, the thrill of flight. It's
so exciting, and I think orches-
tral music really captures that
mix of excitement and anxiety,
but we also thought that music
about flight was so airy - pun
intended - and that it would
fit well with the winter cold
approaching."

Gil and his partner, Caetano Veloso, were exiled from Brazil in 1969

tional Brazilian music, Gil and
his partner Caetano Veloso, were
integrating The Beatles and other
electronic rock artists into local
styles like forro.
"They were very much coun-
terculture and counter-dictator-
ship," said Gil's childhood friend
Bebete Martins, who is head of
the University's Brazil Initiative
at the Center for Latin American
and Caribbean Studies. ,
"But they refused to fit into the
mold of the protest music," Mar-
tins said. "They thought music
and arts and culture should be
open to everything. They sent a
message: Please bring the elec-
tronic.music."
In 1969, the Tropicalia move-
ment came to an end when the
Brazilian government exiled Gil
and Veloso. Gil spent two and
a half years in London, where
he was exposed to new musical
influences. He immersed himself
in the city's rock scene, playing
with Pink Floyd and producing a
solo album in English.
Gil was also introduced to reg-
gae, a genre that severely influ-
enced his music. He would later
go on to perform with Jimmy
Cliff and cover Bob Marley's "No

Woman No Cry."
Gil was appointed Brazil's
Minister of Culture in 2003, dur-
ing which he applied a mental-
ity of cultural expansiveness and
artistic open-mindedness that he
uses in his own music.
"He wanted to help specific
cultural initiatives not in the
main stream," Martins said.
"(The) little manifestations of
cultural traditions in the very
remote areas of Brazil."
Gil resigned from his gov-
ernment post in 2008 to focus
solely on making music. Today,
he tours and adds to an oeuvre
that is already diverse and influ-
ential.
"It's a great opportunity to
see someone so talented and so
diverse in his work," Martins
said of Gil's appeal to the student
body. "Webelieve in freedom. We
want to be independent. We want
to learn about different things.
We are curious. We are eager to
experience new things and learn
more. That's what you want (out
of a performance)."
"He's not Lady Gaga, but I
have to say, he could very easily
perform with Lady Gaga. And it
would be great," Martins added.

Grinwis,'M' ready to

Junior midfielder Fabio Pereira propelled the Michigan men's soccer team to the NCAA second round with three goals.
Pereira hat trick seals victory

You can bet that anyone wear-
ing maize and blue at the first
round of the men's NCAA tour-
nament in Ann Arbor had to have
been biting their nails Thursday
night.
Michigan coach Chaka Daley
might have been one of them. "It

said.

the Purple Eagles 8-0 at the time,

3-1, in a match that was a bit more

Sophomore goalkeeper Adam
Pfrinwis and junior midfielder
Fabio Pereira watched from the
sidelines when the Michigan
men's soccer team made the Col-
lege Cup in 2010. This season,
they're creating some magic of
their own.
Pereira scored all three Michi-
gan goals and Grinwis led a domi-
nant defensive effort on Thursday
night, propelling the Wolverines
to a 3-1 victory over Niagara in the
first round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment. Michigan (5-3-1 Big Ten,
11-9-1 overall) will next face fifth-
seeded Akron, a rematch of an
Oct. 18 match that the Zips won,
i-0.
But the Wolverine squad that
dominated the Purple Eagles is
far improved from the one that
struggled mightily in the begin-
ning of the season. Michigan
commanded every aspect of play
against Niagara (8-1-1 Metro
Atlantic Athletic Conference,
13-2-4), outshooting the Purple
Eagles 26-7 and controlling pos-
session for most of the match.
The Wolverines were so powerful
on offense that Pereira actually
found it harder to score goals.
"We had so much space in that
game," Pereira said. "I think we
were even shocked with how
much space we had. Having 16
shots (in the first half) and not
scoring a goal - I think that's
pretty bad."'
Just four days after dropping
the Big Ten Championship to
Michigan State, Michigan had
revenge on its mind against Niag-
ara and it showed. The Wolver-
ines opened the first half on atear,
creating a one-on-one opportu-
nity in the opening moments that
forced goalkeeper Brett Petricek
to make a key save. The senior was
busy for the entire half, recording
seven saves that kept the match
scoreless when the halftime whis-
tle blew.
"We're incredibly fortunate
to have Brett Petricek represent-

ing Niagara," said Niagara coach
Chase Brooks. "Brett's been abso-
lutely fantastic for us all season."
Michigan's torrid attack led
to the Purple Eagles' only goal of
the game. When the Wolverines
.pushed defensive players forward
to try to capitalize on a free kick,
Petricek smothered the set-piece
shot. He then started a quick
counterattack that ended with
Niagara's go-ahead tally.
But Michigan kept pressuring
and, eventually, the goals came.
"It was anervygame forushav-
ing as many chances as we did and
not converting them," Michigan
coach Chaka Daley said. "That's
football sometimes."
Pereira tallied a stunning three
goals - two on penalty kicks - in
seven minutes to put the game out
of reach midway through the sec-
ond half.
When Daley sent in his sub-
stitutes with under five minute
left in the match, the midfielder
received a standing ovation from
the crowd.
"It's fantastic to get a hat trick,"
Pereira said. "Now I just can't
wait (until) Sunday."
After Pereira's goals gave the
Wolverines a two-goal lead, Grin-
wis and the defense took over.
Though it allowed a goal on Niag-

ara's first shot on target, the unit
limited the Purple Eagles to just
two more attempts on net
But Grinwis still had plenty of
work to do. On each of Niagara's
five corner kicks, it placed 6-foot-
6 striker Callum Willmott in
front of Michigan's goalkeeper.
Grinwis - four inches shorter -
commanded his box well, punch-
ing away crosses and preventing
Willmott from redirecting a sin-
gle header on goal.
"The more games you play, the
more mature you get," Grinwis
said. "I'm just doing my best to
help my team win games. I think
we've been superb (defensively)."
Most of all, Grinwis and Pereira
are looking forward to leaving
their own legacies at Michigan.
After watching their former
teammates complete a string of
upsets in the NCAA Tournament
two years ago that ended with a
loss to Akron in the College Cup,
the young stars are ready to lead
their squad to similar glory.
"In college soccer you don't
get a better chance than ... going
at Akron to send a statement to
the whole country," Pereira said.
"We're really confident. We're a
totally different (than) when we
played them last time. We're all
hungry for thatgame."

LeVert, the last 2012 recruit, waits in the wings

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
Last March, the Michigan
basketball team was upset in
the second round of the NCAA
Tournament by Ohio, ending its
season disappointingly early and
killing some of the good vibes
that came from a season that gar-
nered the program's first Big Ten
title since 1986.
But that game immensely
boosted the stock of Ohio coach
John Groce in the eyes of schools
higher up in the college basket-
ball rungs.
Twelve days after ending the
Wolverines' season, Groce was
named head coach at Illinois.
This freed up the commitments
for all of his incoming recruits,
including a 6-foot-5 guard
named Caris LeVert who shot up
in recruiting rankings.
Shortly after, LeVert got a
recruiting redo and became the
last member of Michigan's 2012
recruiting class, joining highly
touted recruits Glenn Robinson
III and Mitch McGary.
It's hard to play the what-if
game, but if Michigan had beat-
en Ohio last March, LeVert prob-
ably wouldn't be in Ann Arbor
this fall.
And why should you care? This
was a 160-pound beanpole, a guy
Michigan coach John Beilein has
called a "bag of bones" and some-
one who is probably going to red-
shirt this season.
But this is also a guy that was
mentioned, without fail, by every
veteran Wolverine during pre-
season media days as someone
who had surprised them, even
blew them away in practice.
"Caris, man, he's a sleeper,"
sophomore guard Trey Burke
said with a smile during Big
Ten media day in October. "His
potential and his ceiling to grow
are unlimited because he already
has the skill set that a lot of play-
ers at this level don't have. He's
6-foot-5 but can handle the ball

eligibility until he absolutely had
to, meaning that even in a blow-
out, LeVert will remain comfort-
able on the end of the bench.
The coaching staff sees his
immediate potential, but they
also see his potential to grow.
"I want to make a really edu-
cated decision after some time
and get some quality time to
work with him," Beilein said.
"Most times you redshirt some-
one, it's because you think he
can be a special player withmore
time, more weight and all of
those things."

Maybe some of the veterans few years ago, LeVert would have

Freshman guard Caris LeVert is likely doe tsr a redshirt this season.

like a real point guard."
Beilein had scouted the fresh-
man from Pickerington, Ohio
and liked his versatility and
upside, but he was a bit of an
unknown to the rest of the Wol-
verines.
It took less than a full practice*
session to see that LeVert was
going to be more than just a late
addition to the recruiting class.
Players were amazed that some-
body that tall and skinny could
have such impressive body con-
trol and ball-handling skills.
They were also impressed by
his work ethic. LeVert arrived in
Ann Arbor weighing close to 160
pounds, but according to an esti-
mate by junior Tim Hardaway
Jr., has already added 20 pounds
of muscle after a couple months
at Michigan.
"He's in the gym more than
a lot of people," redshirt junior
forward Jordan Morgan said in
Chicago. "He just wants to get
better. His problem was his body,
and he's already put on a lot of

weight and is going to continue
to do that. He just has a lot of
game, and he's willing to take
what anyone has to tell him and
willing to just learn.
"Whether it be this year or in
the near future, he definitely can
be a really, really good player."
Still, this praise all came
before the exhibition games
started, where Levert looked
unspectacular. It was clear he
hadn't adjusted to the speed of
the college game yet, scoring just
three points on 1-of-6 shooting
in a combined 22 minutes of play
in. Michigan's two exhibition
games.
And part of the problem with
switching from a school like
Ohio to a school like Michigan
is the talent and depth of each
team, especially in a year when
Michigan is ranked No. 5 in the
country.
Beilein said before the first
regular-season game against
Slippery Rock that he didn't
want to use up LeVert's redshirt

dropped
game one of the series, 3-1, at
Yost Ice Arena.
"I thought (Racine) played
really well," said senior captain
A.J. Treais. "I thought he played
one of his best games at Michi-
gan. ... It's too bad we couldn't
help him out."
Michigan set the tempo early
in the first period, creating a
couple of grade-A scoring oppor-
tunities. Just over three minutes
into the game, freshman defen-
seman Jacob Trouba narrowly
missed giving the Wolverines a
1-0 lead when-he clanged awris-
ter off the post from the bottom
of the left circle.
Ninety seconds later, though,
another freshman connected
for Michigan. Justin Selman,
forechecking hard in the Notre
Dame zone with fellow fresh-
man Andrew Copp, intercepted
an ill-advised Fighting Irish
pass. Notre Dame goaltender
Steven Summerhays, who had
allowed just 1.64 goals per game
this season entering the game,
guessed wrong and Selman
found an upper corner to give
the Wolverines the lead.
"I thought we forechecked
better," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson.
"We got pucks behind their
(defense). We had our legs and
we had more confidence. As the
game wore on, we wore more on
our heels."
Racine played a terrific peri-
od, turning away every shot he
faced, even when the defense
was caught out of position, an

Freshman forward Justin Selman scored the Wolverines' lone goal of the night ina 3- loss at Yost Ice Arena.

alarming trend that has been
amplified recently.
Though Selman missed a cou-
ple of rebound opportunities for
a second goal of the night, the
period ended with the Wolver-
ines ahead 1-0 after outplaying
the Fighting Irish for the full 20
minutes.
Early in the second period,
though,' a dreadful Michigan
power play allowed Notre Dame
to even the score.
After Austin Wuthrich went
to the box for tripping Racine,
the Wolverines began a two-
minute man advantage that
turned out to be their worst
span of the period. The power
play saw only one shot reach the
net, and the tides turned when
T.J. Tynan sent a pass up ice to
Mike Voran, who netted a short-
handed goal for the Irish to knot
the game at one.
"I think that shorthanded
goal in the second period really
turned the game in the other
direction," Berenson said.
"When you get your power-
play guys out there and they

get scored on, that's a huge goal
for a road team and they took,
advantage of it."
Three minutes later, at the
8:20 mark of the second period,
Michigan was awarded another
power play, which was almost as
disappointing. Again, only one
shot reached Summerhays, and
the Fighting Irish had a couple
near misses of their own, despite
being a man short.
Michigan began the decisive
third period on a 4-on-3 disad-
vantage, which was promptly
killed off - one of the lone spe-
cial-teams bright spots for the
Wolverines all night.
With 15:10 to play in the
game, Treais, the NCAA goals
leader, had a breakaway on Sum-
merhays, but his shot was high
of the net.
Minutes later, sophomore for-
ward Alex Guptill ricocheted a
shot off the crossbar.
Michigan would get no more
quality chances in game.
The game-winning goal final-
ly came for the Fighting Irish
with just over five minutes to

play as Racine, way out of posi-
tion, couldn't catch up to Notre
Dame's Bryan Rust - brother
of former Michigan player Matt
Rust- on a wraparound. Beren-
son described the tally as com-
ing off of "sloppy" play in the
Wolverines' own end.
"Your goalie keeps you in the
game and is playing really well,
and then the wraparound goal is
a tough goal," Berenson said.
An own goal off the skate of
sophomore defenseman Mike
Chiasson sealed the 3-1 win for
Notre Dame.
Despite surrendering, the
eventual game-winner late,
Racine bailed out the defense
several times Thursday, saving
30 of 33 shots faced.
Michigan and Notre Dame
conclude their two-game set
Friday night at Yost with a 7:35
p.m. puck drop.
"Every game is a must win
now," Berenson said of his team,
which dipped below .500 for
the first time since Dec. 2 of
last year. "These are huge home
games for us."

Momentum heading into the
late stages of a season has won*
many teams championships, it's a
wonder why people are still sur-
prised when it happens.
The 2011 Connecticut men's
basketball team stormed through
the Big East Tournament, winning
five games in five days before win-
ning six more in a row en route to
a national championship.
The 2011 New York Giants sat
at 7-7 in Week 15 before winning
their final two games and sneak-
ing into the playoffs, only to take
down the heavily-favored New
England Patriots in Super Bowl
XLVI.
And the 2012 Los Angeles
Kings,the eighth and final teamin
the Western Conference playoffs,
obliterated the rest of the field in
one of the more dominating Stan-
ley Cup runs in NHL history.
Peakin'g at the right time is
everything - and that's just what
the Michigan women's volleyball
team is doing. Since dropping
three straight matches, the Wol-
verines have won five consecu-
tive matches, including 12 straight
sets. one of the reasons behind the
success has been the play of soph-
omore Lexi Dannemiller, who has
won back-to-back Big Ten sett9r of
the week awards. Â£
"I think me playing well
helps the team play well," said
Dannemiller, who is fourth in the
conference in assists per set. "If
my passes aren't good, then the
hitters can't play well. Right now,
I'm putting them in good spots
and they're finishing."

One of the big turnarounds for
Dannemiller and the Wolverines
has been a fresh mindset and out-
look on the court. After failing
to recover from 12 consecutive
dropped points against Purdue on
Oct.26, Michiganturned to sports
psychologistcGregDale in an effort
to stay focused.
"(Greg) came in before our
match with Nebraska and helped
us with things we were struggling
with," Dannemiller said. "He
worked with us on letting things
go and to help us ... not get frus-
trated."
Whatever he told them worked.
The Wolverines' new psyche
helped them to a 9-7 record in the
Big Ten - already one more win
than they had last season, with
four conference games remaining
- and has them poised to make
a run in the NCAA Tournament.
And that road to success will ulti-
mately ride on the production of
Dannemiller down the stretch.
"(My play right now) is a way
to know that we're doing well,"
Dannemiller said. "It gives our
team confidence to trust each
other and trust what we're doing
on the courtto win."
With all four of Michigan's
remaining regular season games
away from Cliff Keen Arena, the
Wolverines understand what it's
going to take to finish the season
on a high note. With a high seed
in the NCAA Tournament up for
grabs, Michigan expects nothing
less than to take care of business,
starting Friday night at North-
western.
"We want to win out,"
Dannemiller added. "That's
doable."

When junior quarterback
Devin Gardner stepped in to
replace injured senior quar-

weeks ago, all eyes turned to the
Michigan running game to see if
it could buoy the offense and help
the first-time starter at quarter-
back.
But, as it turns out, it may not
be so important after all. Gardner
has passed for 234 and 286 yards
in the past two starts, respec-
tively. The rushing numbers,
while not necessarily an accurate
barometer of the offense's suc-
cess, have come crashing down
from the marks set with Robinson
at the helm.
Gardner has teamed up with
redshirt junior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint, often
spelled by sophomore bruiser
Thomas Rawls, to combine for 155
and 133 rushing yards in victories
over Minnesota and Northwest-
ern, though the attempts haven't

Do you know the AIRBHG?
That's the Angry Iowa Run-

thing, or at least the college foot-
ball scene believes it is.
The tailback Michigan faced
last year was Marcus Coker. He
transferred to Stony Brook this
spring.
Then sophomore Jordan Can-
zeri tore his ACL in spring ball.
Sophomore De'Andre Johnson
had two run-ins with the law this
summer and was dismissed from
the team.
Freshman Barklay Hill tore his
left ACL in mid-August. Sopho-
more Damon Bullock took over
as the starter but missed four
games after suffering a concus-
sion in mid-September in a game
against Northern Illinois. He was
replaced by freshman Greg Gar-

mon, who also had a run-in with
the law during the summer, but
Garmon injured his right arm
later in the game.
Guard yourselves, and your
ACLs, out there.
Bullock has since returned to
form and has led the Iowa rush-
ing attack along with sophomore
fullback Mark Weisman. But
Iowa ranks second-to-last in the
Big Ten with 124 rushing yards
per game.
Michigan's front . seven has
made marked improvements
since early struggles against Ala-
bama and Air Force, in particular,
and ranks sixth in the Big Ten,

game.
Edge: Michigan
Iowa pass offense vs. Michigan
pass defense
Considering that the Michi-
gan secondary is the No. 1 pass
defense in the nation at 149.2
passing yards per game, it could
be a very difficult afternoon for
Iowa senior quarterback James
Vandenberg.
The secondary has allowed just
two more passing touchdowns
(nine) than interceptions (seven).
Iowa's offense has that ratio rath-

er backward - five passing touch-
downs to six interceptions.
Though Vandenberg posted an
impressive stat line of 25 touch-
downs and seven interceptions
last fall, his hype train has fal-
tered considerably. Under the
senior signal-caller, Iowa's five
passing touchdowns are good for
third-worst of all FBS teams.
Edge: Michigan
Special teams
The kickers in this matchup
cancel each other out. Michigan's
Brendan Gibbons is 14-for-16 this
fall; Iowa's Mike Meyer is 16-for-
19.
The punters are punters, and
therefore all but cancel each
other out. (Though, let's face it,
Michigan junior Will Hagerup's
44.7 yards per punt gives him the
edge over Iowa punter Connor
Kornbrath.)
Iowa has a few dangerous
return men in Hyde and junior
Jordan Cotton. Cotton has
returned a kick for a touchdown
and leads the Big Ten with a 27.9-
yard average.
(And keep in mind that the
Wolverines allowed a kick return
for a touchdown that was called
back last week.) But Michigan
freshman Dennis Norfleet's 23.7-
yard average isn't too shabby,
either.
Special teams need to be spe-
cial, and both teams are, well,
equally special.
Edge: Push
Intangibles
For the sake of simplicity: This
game is tipping in Michigan's
favor more than the Leaning
Tower of Pisa.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke is
a perfect 13-0 at Michigan Sta-
dium since taking over as head
coach last year. He is 58-6 all-
time on the Michigan sideline.
This is the last home game for a
senior class that has seen the best
and worst of times for the Michi-
gan football program:-
. And this is a bad Iowa team
across the field.
It's stacked up just right, now
it's just time to fill the student
section - before the second quar
ter - and see how it plays out in
between the lines.

2012 Schedule

Alabama (Sept. 1): Michgan's memory needs to
be short after this one. It should be anyway with
some of the hits the Crimson Tide dealt out.
Air Force (Sept. 8): Air Force ran all over
Michigan, but Denard Robinson returned the
favor to squeak out the 31-25 victory.
Massachusetts(Sept.15): Michigan thoroughly
dominated its weakest opponent, trouncing
Massachusetts, 63-13.
Notre Dame (Sept. 22): Robinson threw four
interceptions and Vincent Smith added another,
as the Fighting Irish barely scraped out a 13-6 win.
Purdue (Oct.a6): Kirk Herbstreit picked Purdue
to win the game and the Big Ten before the
game. He went tail-between-the-legs quickly.
Illinois (Oct. 13): The Wolverines had no trou-
ble dispatching the Fighting Illini, who were all
orange and no fight.

Michigan State (Oct. 20): Thank your lucky
brunettes. Brendan Gibbons kicked a game-
winning field goal to finally defeat the Spartans.
Nebraska (Oct. 27): In what.Michigan repeat-
edly called a 'championship week,' Robinson got
injured and Russell Bellomy couldn't do a thing.
Minnesota (Nov. 3): With Robinson out again,
Devin Gardner took a stab at quarterback and
routed the Golden Gophers, 35-13.
Northwestern (Nov. 10): In a late-season
matchup, we found that a wolverine scraps
harder than a wildcat. At the last minute, too.
Iowa (Nov. 17): It's not heaven. It's Iowa - the
utterly mediocre squad that handed Michigan
one of its two losses in 2011.
V Ohio State (Nov. 24): The reincarnation of the
Bo-Woody dynamic, Hoke and Meyer will com-

Sydney. When the parents asked
where the family should eat din-
ner, Omameh would always say
"It's wherever you guys want to go,"
Laura said.
He comes off as quiet to some
because he is reflective, Laura says,
observant. When Omameh was a
child, he struggled to get aword in
edgewise between his brother and
sister.
"When he did speak, he had
a mindset of 'Okay, if I'm gonna
speak, what I say is going to be pro-
found,' "Laura said.
And yes, here it is, the profound:
he opens his mouth and riffs on the
weight of expectations.
"At the end of the day it's just a
game," he muses of his life in foot-
ball. "It's, really, it's not. At this
level, there's so much more on the
line. I remember somebody was
saying after the last staff, they were
on the hot seat, and people were
saying, you could think it's just a
game, but if we come out here and
we perform poorly, this man can
lose his job. That means this fam-
ily, these kids, have no income. You
know what I'm saying?
"If we think it's just a game, this
man loses his job. He can't get on
the field or whatever, and we're the
ones performing, but his job rests

squarely on our shoulders. ... What
it means to some people at a deeper
level, it's hard to look at it as some-
thing that is that trivial."
College football doesn't forgive,
even for the man who always pleas-
es, who always gives. The pressure
weighs. Maybe it weighs more for
him, though you'd never be able to
tell. Like in Omameh's true fresh-
man season, the year Michigan won
just three games. The Wolverines
played No. 9 Wisconsin that year
and trailed by 10 at halftime. The
crowd booed the team all the way
up the tunnel. Omameh hadn't
played - he couldn't please.
"I was probably the most upset 1,
can vividly remember in almost my
entire life," Omameh said. "In the
locker room I was just - that was
the year I redshirted, I didn't even
play that year - and I could choke
somebody.
"It's comical when youreally look
at it in broad terms how much pres-
sure people put on these 18-year old
kids. They really don't know the
effect that it has on some."
Michigan came back and won
that game.
Omameh recalls the same faces
he saw booing the team at halftime
were reaching down over the tun-
nel for high fives.

Patrick Sr. believed his life would
be better in the United States, so in
1980, he left Nigeria to live with rel-
atives in Columbus. He left behind
his home, a city where the people
believe in themselves but also look
down on everyone else, according
to Phyllis. The name of the city is
Onitsha and some there believe it
literally means "arrogance."
But trusting his instincts, Pat-
rick Sr. went back to Onitsha to visit
family and friends, friends who led
him to the very spot he stood now,
led him to this woman named Phyl-
lis.
Again, his instincts told him,
"Look, Patrick, this is the one you're
looking for." And again, he trusted.
Patrick Sr. was calm and poised and
the woman, Phyllis, driven. So driv-
en was she that, "when I set my eyes
on him, I didn't let go." And the two
left together, back to Columbus to
raise a family, leaving Onitsha, the
pride and the arrogance behind.
Their middle child would never
live in this land, but he would come
from here.
He would be calm and driven,

and a heart that would make you

reply, "See you next week," and he'd
return because he didn't want to be
a liar. He's been going for five years
now, still true to his word, still radi-
ating his light.
Omameh likes to joke that he
"revolutionized the game - the
hospital-visit game." His visits are
different. When he goes with team-
mates, they split into groups and
visit every room on a floor. The kids
always remember Omameh. He
likes to say that his group has never
lost.
"There's my man Jalen," he says
to one young boy, giving him a cool
nodz "We go way back."
As Omameh and his teammates
sign autographs for patients inside
a room on the first floor, one young
girl waits outside. Her medical
equipment prevents her from com-

ing in. Omameh greets her outside,
then goes around to each of his
teammates, making sure everyone
pays her a visit. Soon enough, she
has collected each autograph.
Later, a mother walks out of the
room with her daughter, a new face.
"He's funny," the mother says as the
daughter smiles.
They hang on his every word,
about his illustrious tennis career
or about his preference for long
walks on the beach, holding hands.
Smiles and jokes all around. Craig
Roh agrees. That's good, Omameh
says. "Holding hands is difficult
when you're by yourself. At least it
looks awkward."
More giggles.
"Really all I try to do is just try
to make the kids laugh," Omameh
says. "Anything to put a smile on

their face. A lot of the times, par-
ents will be like, 'Oh my god, my son
hasn't smiled in two months. He's
laughing hysterically.'
"I'mlike, 'Cool. That's what I was
tryingto do.'"
Would you believe that
Omameh's words hang in the air
just an instant longer? That when
Omameh talks, the words come out
cool like jazz, low and elegant? Each
word sounds important --yes, never
yeah.
He speaks effortlessly, like every-
thing he does, but maybe that's
deceiving. The football seemed to
come easyto Omameh, too, from the
calm he inherited from his father,
Patrick Sr., who had lived through a

civil war in Nigeria before emigrat-
ing to the United States. But under-
neath this peace, there's the drive of
Phyllis, his mother.
Don't let the relaxation fool
you. By senior day of his fifth year,
Omameh has started 39 straight
games at guard for Michigan. He
was named to the Allstate AFCA
Good Works Team - given to 11
players in the nation for exemplary
volunteer service - and he stud-
ies sociology and communications,
with a concentration in business
for good measure. But he deadpans,
"Procrastination, it's a lifestyle. It's
so embedded in me now." Sure.
Everything Omameh does is
meticulous. His outfits are put
together with care. His notes in
film study are scrupulous, his fun-
damentals refined. The way he eats,

"I've never seen a more organized
meticulous eater than that young
guy," said Michigan offensive line
coach Darrell Funk.
As a freshman, Omameh weighed
251 pounds. Now, he's 305. He likes
to come early toSchembechler Hall
to study film. And on top of that, he
adds the volunteer work - not just
at Mott - and two majors.
"Sometimes when you see a fast
kid it doesn't look like he's fast
because he's just kind of gliding,"
Jacoby said. "I think his work.ethic
is so much above most kids, espe-
cially lineman-type kids, he just
makes it look like it's easy."
He lives to please others, and
now it's an expectation. As the
middle child, Omameh played the
peacekeeper between his older sis-
ter, Laura, and younger brother,

t's been a bumpy season for
Iowa.
Beset by injuries at run-
ning back and offensive line,
including season-ending injuries
for left tackle Brandon Scherff and
right guard Andrew Donnal, the
Hawkeyes have had a disappoint-
ing season. That includes quarter-
back James Vandenberg, who has
struggled after emerging as one of
the better signal-callers in the con-
ference last season.
But fifth-year senior center
James Ferentz - son of Iowa coach
Kirk Ferentz and brother of first-
year offensive line coach Bryan
Ferentz - has been a steady force
through all the ups and downs.
Back at Big Ten Media Days
in July, the Daily sat down with
Ferentz to discuss having fam-
ily members as coaches, what Van-
denberg brings to the table and his
team's success against Michigan in
recent years.
The Michigan Daily: I'm sure
you've been asked this plenty
of times, but what's it like to be
coached by your dad?
James Ferentz: It's a vety unique
situation. It's something that, I
can't imagine there's too many
other kids (who). get to play for
their dad in college football, let
alone get coached by their brother,
and then coached by their dad on
top of that. It's a very unique situ-
ation. I'm very thankful to be in it,
and I'm just really trying to enjoy
it since it's so unique. I don't think
there's a whole lot of other people
that get to experience this.
TMD: I assume you call him
"coach" and not "dad" when you're
with the team, right?
JF: Oh yeah. Now it's just a little
more confusing since we have two
Coach Ferentzs (laughs).
TMD: Has your dad treated you
like his son, or have you been like
any other player over your time
there?
JF: That was something that he
did a great job of when I first came

Fifth-year senior center James Ferentz is one of five children of Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz. The entire family has been a long-time fixture in lowa City.

in. He was very hands off, he just
treated me like another guy on
the team. He let me make my own
name. It was up to my to prove to
my teammates that I wasn't here
just because of my last name, and
that I belong.
TMD: Your quarterback is seem-
ingly one of the few true dropback
passers left in the Big Ten. What do
you think of his place in the confer-
ence, which seems to have more
dual-threat guys by the year?
1F: The Big Ten has a great crop
of quarterbacks. You look at every
team, I think everyone has one of
the best quarterbacks. It's hard
to compare them because every-
one has different styles, but I
wouldn't trade James for anybody
else. Every time he's on the field, I

think we have the potential to win
the game. When he also steps on
the field, he makes everyone else
around him better. So we're real-
ly fortunate to have James back
there, and as an offensive line, it
motivates us to keep him upright
and healthy.
TMD: For all he accomplished
and all the numbers he put up last
season, it seems like he's some-
thing of a forgotten man in terms
of getting attention and accolades
and all that. Do you think he's
underappreciated by those outside
Iowa?
JF: Ijust thinkhe's in a tight spot,
because whenyou have players like
Denard Robinson who are so elec-
tric and just phenomenal football
players, maybe another year, dif-

ferent conference, he would be at
the top of the list because he is def-
initely well deserving, but he's just
behind some other extraordinary
football players.
TMD: But you guys certainly
know what he's capable of.
JF: It's no mystery to me or the
guys on the offensive line. I think I
speak for the rest of the team, like
I said, I honestly believe anytime
Vandenberg steps on the field, we
have the potential to win the game.
TMD: Last year's game against
Michigan was certainly a tight-
ly-contested one. What are your
memories of that matchup?
JF: I just remember the last
play of the game, when we bat-
ted it down in the end zone. We
were very fortunate to come out

with the victory. This year obvi-
ously we're going up to Ann Arbor,
and it's going to be a very difficult
game. Coach Hoke's done a great
job with them, and we're ready for
a challenge.
TMD: (Redshirt junior offensive
tackle) Taylor Lewan just men-
tioned how he hasn't beaten Iowa
yet in his four years. How have you
guys been able to have so much
success against Michigan in these
last few years?
JF: I hadn't even thought of it
until you just said it to be honest
with you.
I think it's just how we try and
operate one game at a time, focus
on the game at hand, because the
most important step's the one right
in front of you.
