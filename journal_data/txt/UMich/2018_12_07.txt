The 
Yemeni 
Student 
Association at the University of 
Michigan opened its inaugural 
cultural night with a simple 
invitation to attendees: 
“We want you to experience 
the beauty of Yemeni culture,” 
LSA junior Ryan Shami told the 
more than 150 students gathered 
Thursday night in the West 
Quad Multipurpose Room. 
Shami then danced his way 
through the middle of the room 
with other board members, all 
clad in traditional thawbs, multi-
colored shawls and jambiya 
dagger belts unique to Yemeni 
men’s 
fashion. 
The 
women 
of YSA also took the floor for 
dabke, showing off dresses and 
headpieces from various regions 
of the country while making 
their way through the diverse 
crowds 
of 
students 
packed 
between various photo exhibits 
and food buffets. Guests ate 
dishes spanning from gallaba to 
harissa desserts, sipped Yemeni 
tea, flipped through pictures 
of ancient villages, castles and 
mountain and clapped along to 
the dance performances. 
And so went YSA’s capstone 
event 
of 
the 
semester: 
a 
celebration of not only the rich 

heritage honored by Yemenis 
on campus, but also a growing 
community making its mark in 
bringing students together. 
YSA was born two years ago 
in 2016 with just four students 
who saw the a need for a 
space created by and for the 
Yemeni community. Through 

informal shahee circles with 
the club’s signature tea service, 
networking with prospective 
students and showcases like 
Thursday’s cultural night, the 
student group has exploded 
from the four founders to almost 
50 members and hundreds of 
supporters across campus. LSA 

senior Sadeeque Mohamed was 
part of the original group in 
2016, and was overcome by the 
“amazing” scene he saw at the 
cultural night. 

The University of Michigan 
Board 
of 
Regents’ 
meeting 
Thursday featured 15 public 
comment speakers, including 
U-M Ann Arbor and Dearborn 
students as well as alumni, 
faculty and staff. The topics 
discussed 
included 
carbon 
neutrality, 
divestment 
from 
companies 
supporting 
Israel 
and the role of letters of 

recommendation in a political 
context.
At 
his 
annual 
leadership 
breakfast earlier this semester, 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 
he 
would appoint a commission to 
establish a timeline and distinct 
goals 
for 
achieving 
carbon 
neutrality. Starting in 2008 and 
2009, a wave of universities 
mobilized around the nation 
to 
aim 
for 
carbon-neutral 
campuses. The University of 
Michigan, 
however, 
lagged 

behind. Earlier this week in 
an interview with The Daily, 
Schlissel said the commission 
“can’t be too large.”
Neurology professor Larry 
Junck contributed suggestions 
to raise awareness and educate 
on campus sustainability. In 
addition to themed semesters, he 
recommended multidisciplinary 
weekly 
conferences 
with 
a 
variety of topics and groups.
“My proposal is that there 
be 
University-wide 
themed 
semesters dealing with various 

aspects 
of 
climate 
change,” 
Junck said. “This is a large and 
great University with resources 
in many areas.”
LSA junior Kristen Hayden 
said 
the 
University’s 
next 
steps toward carbon neutrality 
should 
include 
scientific 
recommendations 
from 
the 
Intergovernmental 
Panel 
on 
Climate Change and the national 
climate assessment.
“With our dedication, our 

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
faculty 
panel 
on 
academic 
freedom 
is 
seeking 
input 
from 
the 
campus 
community 
on 
“the intersection of faculty 
members’ political ideology 
and 
their 
responsibilities 
to students,” the University 
announced in a press release. 
In addition to conducting a 
campus-wide online survey 
of attitudes on the subject, 
the panel will also hold a 
series of open meetings in 
December and January on the 
University’s three campuses 
to gather additional input.
The 
University 
created 
the 
panel 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
its 
punishment 
of 
American 
Culture 
professor 
John 
Cheney-
Lippold, 
who 
rescinded 
his offer to write a letter 
of 
recommendation 
for 
a 
student’s study abroad trip 
after discovering the program 
was 
in 
Israel. 
Cheney-
Lippold’s 
punishment 
consists of a year-long pay 

freeze, as well as a two-
year freeze on his sabbatical 
credits and eligibility. Several 
professional 
institutions, 
including 
the 
American 
Association 
of 
University 
Professors, in addition to 
many graduate students and 
faculty have criticized the 
University for imposing the 
discipline on Cheney-Lippold 
without due process.
University 
President 
Mark Schlissel and Provost 
Martin Philbert announced 
the creation of the panel in 
an open letter to the campus 
titled “Important questions 
around issues of personal 
beliefs, our responsibilities 
as 
educators, 
and 
anti-
Semitism.”
“As we have stated, U-M 
strongly opposes a boycott of 
Israeli academic institutions, 
and 
no 
school, 
college, 
department or unit at our 
university endorses such a 
boycott,” the letter read. “We 
will work to make absolutely 
clear that faculty members’ 
personal 
political 
beliefs 
cannot interfere with their

the

reopening last Saturday after

cited 
harassment 
by 
“communists” and local media 
in its store front window on 
East Liberty Street as reasons 
for closing. 
In August, store owner J.C.

that 
accused 
Potts of using racial slurs and 
expressing white unification.

Sitting in front of a group 
of about 20 students, activists 
and 
community 
members 
Thursday evening in Mason 
Hall, Kate Stenvig, organizer 
of By Any Means Necessary, 
led a public “tribunal” to 
encourage conversation and 
organize action against rape 
and sexual assault. BAMN and 
Stop Trump Ann Arbor jointly 
hosted 
the 
event, 
which 
addressed 
current 
issues 
impacting 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
community, 
such as the sexual assault 
allegations 
against 
Music, 
Theatre & Dance professor 
David Daniels and the recent 
closure of Pangea Piercing 
due to allegations of abuse, 
sexism and white supremacy 

by owner J.C. Potts. 
Stenvig 
opened 
the 
discussion 
by 
mentioning 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Brett 
Kavanaugh’s 
recent 
appointment 
despite 
being 
accused 
of 
sexual 
assault 
by Christine Blasey Ford, 
a 
professor 
at 
Palo 
Alto 
University, 
in 
September. 
She noted how speaking out 
against sexual assault and 
rape is painful for survivors, 
but can lead to a sustained 
movement against what she 
said is a current “epidemic” 
of assault and human rights 
abuses.
“Our fight for our own 
dignity 
and 
freedom 
and 
equality is completely tied up 
with a collective fight that can 
actually lead the movement 
toward defending democracy, 
opening borders and really 

building the new civil rights 
and human rights movement 
that 
can 
defeat 
Trump,” 
Stenvig said.
Along with Aarefah Mosavi, 
keynote speaker and anti-rape 
activist, Stenvig denounced a 
culture of victim-blaming that 
often surrounds those who 
choose to speak out against 
their abusers. In May, Mosavi 
filed a case against Mount St. 
Antonio College in Walnut, 
Calif., alleging former student 
and friend Chester Brown 
raped her while on campus. 
Now, Mosavi is touring college 
campuses around the country 
to 
speak 
candidly 
about 
her assault and experience 
reporting the event to her 
college’s administration.
“The 
sexist 
illogic 
and 
victim blaming, trivializing 
our 
experiences 
and 
slandering 
women 
as 
liars 
or 
promiscuous 
temptresses 
who 
are 
asking for it still remains 
pervasive in our courts,” 
Mosavi said. “In my own 
case, 
defense 
attorneys 
demanded to know why 
I trusted Brown, as if the 
act of trusting one who 
you believe to be a friend 
is a crime.”
Mosavi 
further 
discussed her experience 
encountering sexism when 
reporting her rape to the 
college’s 
administration 
and, eventually, to the state 
courts. She said Brown 
was often given privileges 
of privacy and respect 
while her information was 
made public, putting her 
in danger.
“At every turn, I was 
denied the same rights and 
privileges the man who 
raped me was afforded,” 
Mosavi said. “But just as 
civil society has demanded 
the ousting of inept judges 
who 
sympathize 
with 

rapists or who blamed rape 
survivors, so too must we 
continue to say ‘no’ to victim 
blaming.”
Ann Arbor resident Alice 
Held, who was introduced by 
Jessica Prozinski, president 
of Stop Trump Ann Arbor, 
spoke about her experiences 
with Potts’ abusive, racist 
and sexist behavior. Pangea 
Piercing 
closed 
Thursday 
following months of protests 
and 
temporary 
closures. 
Held said she has recently 
felt 
empowered 
to 
speak 
out against her abuser after 
having suppressed it out of 
pain and fear.
“About a year and a half 
ago, I went and I got my 
nipples pierced from J.C. and 
I had no idea that he actually 
already had a reputation for 
bringing up racist topics and 
being misogynistic and just a 
real ass during his piercings,” 
Held said. “So I went and I 
did that, and he commented 
on my body when he was 
taking the measurements for 
the jewelry and said that my 
breasts and my curves were 
‘blessed.’ And that made me 
really 
uncomfortable, 
but 
I’m really used to people in 
power 
making 
comments 
like that when it’s really not 
appropriate, and I’m used to 
minimizing it and brushing 
it off so that’s exactly what I 
did.”
This past Saturday, Held 
was getting ready to protest 
outside of Pangea when she 
remembered details about her 
abuse that she had previously 
repressed. 
Held 
said 
her 
memory has given her power 
to take action against Potts’ 
behavior.
“Eventually 
I 
had 
this 
breakthrough 
where 
I 
realized that I hold the truth 
in this situation and in some 

“
 ”The darn problem with these cases, even this one in Music, 
Theatre and Dance that has become a bit notorious, the initial 
complaints were anonymous complaints, and it’s extremely difficult to 
follow-up on anonymous complaints but we do … When you don’t hear 
of an investigation it doesn’t mean the University is ignoring it.”

BAMN and Stop Trump hold event to 
discuss racism, sexual misconduct

The tribunal covered SMTD misconduct reports and white supremacy at piercing shop

LIAT WEINSTEIN
Daily Staff Reporter

This Friday, The Daily is spotlighting one of our Managing Design 
Editors, Roseanne Chao. Here are her words of wisdom: 

I used to avoid speaking up because I didn’t want to get 
weird stares or a questionable reputation. But now I realized 
that having a questionable reputation gives you way more 
opportunities in life than having no reputation at all. 

See BAMN, Page 3


way that’s going to protect me,” 
Held said. “The truth is going 
to protect me and I have to 
have faith in that.”
An 
LSA 
freshman 
who 
requested 
to 
remain 
anonymous said the tendency 
for universities to ignore or 
diminish sexual assault claims 
is especially painful for those 
who have experienced abuse in 
the past.
“I was a victim of sexual 
abuse, I was groomed for 
two years, and it has very 
deeply impacted my mental 

health,” she said. “I’m finally 
able to seek therapy and help 
for it, which is very nice to 
finally be able to do that, 

but it’s horrifying to me that 
something so traumatic and 
something that impacts people 

on such a deep and personal 
level and which can destroy you 
is being neglected just because 
somebody wants to make the 
university look better.”
Stenvig 
ended 
the 
conversation by noting how 
difficult and brave it is for 
survivors 
to 
make 
their 
experiences public to find some 
semblance of justice. She also 
said sexual assault has become 
so commonplace that speaking 
out is necessary, but often bears 
no reward for the survivor due 
to victim-blaming.
“We shouldn’t have to be 
subjected to abuse to be at 
the University of Michigan,” 
Stenvig said.

hard work, there is also hope 
that we can reach a clean, 
sustainable U of M, and by 
extension, world,” Hayden said. 
“Let’s turn the defining issue of 
my generation into the defining 
success. We are the future.”
Alum 
Missy 
Stults, 
sustainability and innovation 
manager for the city of Ann 
Arbor, 
added 
young 
people 
should be included in the process 
of achieving carbon neutrality.
“As you move forward with 
creating your carbon neutrality 
taskforce, I strongly encourage 
you 
to 
engage 
students, 
especially 
undergraduate 
students, 
in 
this 
endeavor,” 
Stults said. “I also encourage you 
to think about engaging youth, 
these are the next generation of 
leaders.”
Moving on to conversations 
around 
the 
University’s 
relationship 
with 
the 
state 
of 
Israel, 
Rackham 
student 
Yahya Hafez voiced opposition 
surrounding 
the 
University’s 
punishment 
of 
American 
Culture professor John Cheney-
Lippold. Earlier this semester, 
Cheney-Lippold rescinded his 
decision to write a letter of 
recommendation for a student 
wishing to study abroad in 
Israel. The University’s decision 
to 
admonish 
Cheney-Lippold 
stirred discussion on campus 
regarding the role of faculty’s 
academic freedoms in regards 
to their students. Following 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
punishment, 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert 
appointed a faculty panel to 
investigate these issues, though 
the group has been criticized 
as not being representative of 
faculty views and levels across 
the University.
Hafez 
stated 
other 
professional organizations have 
warned againstthe University’s 
actions handling the situation. 
In regard to Philbert’s panel, 
Hafez commented on the lack 
of Cheney-Lippold’s colleagues 
in humanities departments in 
the body, claiming this was a 
mistake and undemocratic.
“That 
the 
provost 
then 
unilaterally created a panel 
to 
retroactively 
justify 
and 
recommend policies allowing 
these actions is even more 
egregious,” 
Hafez 
said. 
“Particularly given the complete 
exclusion of any panel members 
from the humanities, no amount 
of community input can make up 
for the undemocratic structure.”
The public comment then 

shifted to a condemnation of 
the University for not acting 
on 
divestment 
resolutions 
in the past. Students Allied 
for Freedom and Equality, a 
group of students promoting 
social justice and human rights 
of Palestinians, brought the 
original resolution, which sought 
to divest funds from companies 
committing 
human 
rights 
violations against Palestinians 
in Israel, to the forefront of 
University conversation over the 
past decade and a half. Last year, 
Central 
Student 
Government 
passed the divestment resolution 
for the first time ever, joining 
student governments on the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses in their 
support. However, a majority of 
the regents refused to consider 
SAFE’s call for a committee 
to investigate the University’s 
investments, releasing an online 
statement on the matter weeks 
after the resolution. 
U-M 
Dearborn 
student 
Susan Yaseen spoke of a lack of 
support 
Palestinian 
students 
felt from the University on its 
Dearborn campus. Yaseen also 
expressed 
disappointment 
in 
the University’s handling of the 
resolution for divestment.
“We 
feel 
that 
we 
lack 
meaningful support from our 
administration 
at 
Dearborn 
when it comes to speaking in our 
own voices,” Yaseen said. “The 
issues that we care deeply about 
seem to have traction only when 
non-Arabs are involved.”
Graduate student instructor 
Elizabeth Walz spoke against 
all 
study-abroad 
programs 
located in Israel, claiming they 
contribute to the violation of 
Palestinian 
freedoms. 
GSIs 
also joined Cheney-Lippold in 
academic boycotts of Israel: 
Early 
in 
october, 
Rackham 
student Lucy Peterson, a Political 
Science GSI, also declined to 
write a reccomendation letter 
for a student studying in Israel.
Walz said the University’s 
commitment to student freedoms 
was also not maintained when 
the 
University 
refused 
to 
consider the resolution passed 
by CSG.
“What 
has 
University 
of 
Michigan, and what specifically 
have you, the regents, done 
to 
protect 
this 
supposed 
freedom when the CSG passed 
the resolution to explore the 
divestment?” 
Walz 
asked. 
“Especially after sitting through 
the meeting today, does this 
University care about anything 
other than money?”
The Regents did not respond 
to any of the public comment 
speakers.

obligations to our students 
with regard to letter-writing 
and 
all 
other 
modes 
of 
academic support.”
Faculty 
members 
have 
criticized 
the 
lack 
of 
diversity on the panel, noting 
it consists entirely of full 
professors, 
and 
does 
not 
include 
any 
professors 
in 
the humanities. The panel 
is chaired by Science and 
Engineering professor James 
Duderstadt, who served as the 
University’s president from 
1988 to 1996. Duderstadt could 
not be reached for direct 
comment.
“Our goal is to solicit a 
broad range of perspectives 
on 
this 
question: 
What 
ought to be intersection of 
faculty 
members’ 
political 
thought/ideology and their 
responsibilities to students?” 
Duderstadt said in the press 
release. “Our charge is not to 
formulate specific policy or 
processes, but to recommend 
appropriate 
considerations 
and principles.”
In a recent interview with 
The Daily, Schlissel affirmed 
the purpose of the panel was 
to analyze the opinions of the 
community, clarifying final 
decisions on policy would rest 

with him, Philbert and the 
University’s deans.
On Dec. 3, the Office of 
the Provost sent an email 
to 
students 
and 
faculty 
announcing 
the 
faculty 
panel’s 
open 
meetings 
and containing a link to 
the 
four-question 
survey. 
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen said the initial 
response to the message “has 
been good.”
The 
first 
question 
asks 
whether respondents agree 
with the panel’s identification 
of primary “responsibilities to 
students”: teaching, advising, 
assessing, giving feedback and 
recommending. The second 
question asks if respondents 
can 
envision 
“conflicts 
between 
faculty 
members’ 
political thought … and faculty 
members’ 
responsibilities 
to students,” and how they 
should be managed.
Professor Emeritus Alan 
Wald spoke at a recent teach-
in held in response to the 
University’s punishment of 
Cheney-Lippold 
that 
was 
dubbed 
the 
“Unappointed 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Academic 
Freedom.” 
Wald 
said 
the 
survey 
questions 
failed to get at the heart of 
the issue, and seemed like 
“a diversion from the truly 
pressing concerns.”
“They (the questions) evade 
the central problem that has 

now become crucial to both 
faculty and students, and is 
the cause for campus-wide 
concern: Is it permissible for 
faculty members to rely on 
their own ethical reasoning 
when 
making 
decisions 
that affect students, such 
as whether or not to write a 
letter of recommendation for a 
position with an organization 
or institution that engages 
in discrimination or other 
practices to which the faculty 
member is morally opposed?” 
Wald wrote in an email to 
The Daily. “At present, this 
reads like a smoke screen to 
provide the veneer of open 
and inclusive decision-making 
when, in reality, the fix is 
already in.”
The third survey question 
asks, “Do notions of academic 
freedom bear on question #2?” 
History 
professor 
Howard 
Brick, who spoke at the same 
teach-in, called the survey 
questions 
“exceptionally 
vague.” Questions of defining 
academic freedom, he said, 
“must ultimately reside with 
the faculty.” Brick agreed the 
University should seek the 
input of students and staff, 
but expressed doubts about 
whether the panel’s outreach 
would 
provide 
a 
genuine 
opportunity, given the actions 
the University had already 
taken.
“To 
convene 
such 
a 

discussion 
after 
punitive 
measures have been taken 
against the faculty member 
shows a deep problem with 
the 
whole 
university’s 
response 
to 
this 
issue,” 
Brick said. “If it doesn’t cast 
doubt on the fairness of that 
inquiry in terms of how (the)] 
committee and its powers 
are constituted, it at least 
exposes the punishment of the 
professor as unfair, because 
it confesses that there has 
been no consensual terms 
regarding the legitimacy of 
such actions heretofore.”
According to Broekhuizen, 
however, “academic freedom 
is 
not 
in 
question.” 
In 
an 
earlier 
interview 
with 
The Daily, Schlissel agreed 
the problem was not one of 
freedom of expression, which 
he said could be practiced 
through venues that didn’t 
overlap with responsibilities 
to students.
“We also want the faculty 
to 
share 
this 
consensus 
that it’s about the student,” 
Schlissel said. “It’s not about 
(the professors). It’s not a 
platform for their speech and 
their politics. It’s about our 
obligation to support students. 
And it can’t be imposed as a 
rule; it has to be imposed by 
values.”

they have felt vulnerable and 
unable to disagree. Complaints 
range 
from 
racist, 
sexist 
and 
transphobic 
comments 
to sexual harassment while 
customers 
were 
getting 
piercings. 
Many 
others 
expressed their concerns with 
the safety and professionalism 
of the process, mentioning 
scarring and pain. 
At a BAMN event Thursday 
night, Ann Arbor resident 
Alice Held denounced Potts’ 
behavior as misogynistic.
“About a year and a half 

ago, I went and I got my 
nipples pierced from JC and 
I had no idea that he actually 
already had a reputation for 

bringing up racist topics and 
being misogynistic and just a 
real ass during his piercings,” 
she said. “So I went and I did 

that, and he commented on my 
body when he was taking the 
measurements for the jewelry 
and said that my breasts and 
my 
curves 
were 
‘blessed.’ 
And that made me really 
uncomfortable, but I’m really 
used to people in power making 
comments like that when it’s 
really not appropriate, and 
I’m used to minimizing it and 
brushing it off so that’s exactly 
what I did. Eventually I had 
this breakthrough where I 
realized that I hold the truth 
in this situation and in some 
way that’s going to protect me. 
The truth is going to protect 
me and I have to have faith in 
that.”

experience with journalism and 
the free press, Thursday in an 
event sponsored by the English 
Language 
and 
Literature 
Department.
Gutiérrez was first detained 
December 
2017, 
though 
he 
sought asylum months earlier. 
He was received an emergency 
stay before deportation, but 
was 
detained 
and 
released 
a second time this summer. 
Since then, Gutiérrez and his 
son have been living in Ann 
Arbor following the beginning 
of his fellowship in September, 
traveling back to El Paso, Texas, 
several times for immigration 
hearings.
Gutiérrez, 
through 
a 
professional Spanish translator, 
described 
the 
traumatic 
experience of leaving Mexico. 
He emphasized how military 

intimidation and concern for 
his own life and the life of 
his adolescent son was what 
ultimately pushed him to leave.
“It seemed incredible to me 
that we were leaving behind 
forever our modest legacy, our 
home. To preserve our lives 
was more important. In the 
darkness of that night, our lives 
changed. The following day, 
we had determined already to 
ask for political asylum in the 
United States, that was our 
opportunity for life,” Gutiérrez 
said. “We had security, but not 
freedom. The first night that 
we were under protection, they 
put us in a room that was so cold 
that we could see our breath 
and our fingers were numb. We 
had to ask one of the guards that 
he let us look for some towels 
so we could protect ourselves 
from the wind coming from 
the air-conditioning. I covered 
my son with two towels and 
hugged him to keep him warm.”
He described the frustration 

with the ongoing case, from 
the lack of consideration of 
witnesses 
to 
missing 
case 
documents.
“Our case has been very 
tiring, we have been in this 
process for 10 years already,” 
Gutiérrez said. “The judge has 
taken our case, instead of doing 
it as a matter of legal process, 
he’s taken it as a personal 
matter.”
According to the Committee 
to 
Protect 
Journalists, 
47 
journalists have been killed in 
Mexico since 1992. Gutiérrez 
assured this number is much 
higher when responding to a 
student inquiry regarding the 
costs versus benefits of risking 
his life for the sake of freedom 
of expression.
“The risk that you take is for 
the love of the work and love 
of the freedom, and because 
you like to participate in a 
democratic society,” Gutiérrez 
said. 
“My 
recommendation 
is that before you report, to 

investigate, and if it’s not 
prudent for your life, perhaps 
don’t work. I say that because 
in Mexico there are statistics 
of 128 journalists assassinated 
in 11 years, 30 that have 
disappeared. And Mexico, even 
though it is not a place with war, 
there are 320,000 dead in 11 
years. So you have an idea of the 
risk that you take in the name of 
freedom of expression.”
Gutiérrez 
also 
considered 
the 
political 
environment, 
from 
Donald 
Trump’s 
administration’s 
hardline 
immigration policy and Central 
American 
migrant 
caravans 
that have pushed to enter 
the U.S in the past year. He 
correlated current immigration 
tension in the U.S. to historical 
U.S. policy in Central America.
“The people that are at the 
border now from Honduras, 
Guatemala, 
El 
Salvador, 
Nicaragua,” 
Gutiérrez 
said. 
“Their countries are in crisis 
from corruption and poverty 

and violence that comes from 
political involvement from the 
U.S. Nobody wants to leave 
their home to come for an 
adventure. I left my good job 
behind, I had two houses as a 
legacy for my child. And besides 
my hob, I had the opportunity 
to run a ranch. I felt happy with 
my work.”
Prof. 
Andrea 
Zemgulys, 
director 
of 
undergraduate 
studies, 
highlighted 
the 
pertinence of the discussion 
for students to explore future 
careers and understand the 
importance 
of 
professional 
writing.
“We’re definitely trying to 
think about our majors, and 
any student who’s on campus 
and thinking about a career 
in writing, and just kind of 
helping think about the future, 
this is a step in that direction,” 
Zemgulys said. “We, in general, 
are 
trying 
to 
think 
more 
about life after college for our 
students, and so professional 

writing and journalism is one 
of those things.”
LSA sophomore Ellie Katz 
attended the event because 
of its national relevance and 
to hear a firsthand account of 
immigration, especially as it 
relates to freedom of expression 
in other nations.
“I came to learn more about 
his 
experience,” 
Katz 
said. 
“We’ve been talking so much 
about the immigrant experience 
in our (Spanish) class and what 
it means politically to be a 
migrant, but also, in more of 
a humanitarian sense, to be a 
person without a home. I think 
that today I learned about his 
experience in particular but 
also his reiteration of how it 
feels to be a person without a 
state or a home, just kind of 
existing in the in between. That 
was most impactful for me.”

A

s a buzz of tweets about 
Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s 
possible 2020 election run 
have 
surfaced 
in 
the past few days, a 
particular meeting 
has resurfaced in 
the minds of many 
progressives. 
In 
2017, O’Rourke met 
with the American 
Israel Public Affairs 
Committee, 
a 
prominent 
pro-
Israel 
political 
action 
committee, 
and affirmed his support for Israel 
in a tweet expressing that he 
learned “how the United States 
can 
continue 
to 
support 
our 
important ally in the region.” As 
many progressives identify as pro-
Palestine, O’Rourke’s status as their 
hero is being questioned. Why are 
we just now learning or re-learning 
about this seemingly important 
policy stance after his Senate race 
has ended?
It’s because Democrats don’t love 
to talk about foreign policy. Despite 
its importance to American voters, 
it has never been a rallying cry for 
the Democrats. Instead of drawing 
attention to the civil war in Yemen 
or political instability in South and 
Central America, Democrats have 
been talking a lot about who might 
run in 2020: O’Rourke, Minnesota 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Vermont Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, California Sen. 
Kamala Harris and the list goes 
on. The election is still about two 
years off, but potential candidates 
are already speaking explicitly 
about their prospects. This buzz is 
indicative of our current political 
state, in which sensationalism akin 
to Hollywood gossip and iconic 
personalities 
often 
overshadow 
policy concerns. 

That is not to say 2020 isn’t 
important — curtailing Donald 
Trump’s 
presidency 
should 
definitely be a prominent 
Democratic aim. As we 
inevitably 
focus 
our 
attention on 2020, I hope 
Democrats will hone in on 
foreign policy and national 
security as a key part of 
their campaign effort. 
The Democratic Party 
has long been ambivalent on 
foreign policy, which makes 
it a very difficult issue to 
unite our base around. 
Issues such as the U.S. alliance with 
Israel and Saudi Arabia, the war 
in Iraq and intervention in war-
torn Syria have left Democratic 
politicians on opposing sides. 
There is not quite a salient divide, 
as Democrats don’t emphasize 
these subjects enough to stir up 
huge controversy within the party.
While Democrats love to focus 
on health care and economic 
justice, 
national 
security 
concerns consistently rank among 
Americans’ top three concerns. 
The way we choose to engage in 
Yemen and Syria will have a large 
impact on our national security 
for years to come. Thus, Trump’s 
reckless engagement in these 
areas should be a major focal point 
for Democrats, but we instead 
continue to allow Republicans to 
attack us on the grounds of being 
weak and dovish.
More important than the smart 
political 
strategy 
that 
strong 
Democratic foreign policy could 
be, these issues are of great moral 
consequence. The Yemeni Civil 
War is the largest humanitarian 
crisis of our time, and the country 
is quickly headed toward famine. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. continues 
to manufacture and ship arms 

to Saudi Arabia to keep bombing 
innocent Yemeni civilians. As long 
as Democrats claim to be on the 
side of social justice, they must 
hold our leaders accountable for 
the blood on their hands.
Thankfully, 
a 
new 
class 
of Democrats like New York 
incoming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez and Minnesota incoming 
Rep. Ilhan Omar are starting to 
look abroad in their fight for justice 
and call attention to the plight to 
which we are contributing. Ben 
Rhodes, deputy national security 
adviser 
to 
President 
Barack 
Obama, has also taken on the 
project of encouraging Democrats 
to talk about national security by 
creating the National Security 
Action, an organization dedicated 
to “shining a light on” the Trump 
administration’s 
dangerous 
foreign policy and constructing a 
Democratic vision.
While Trump continues to 
praise 
Saudi 
Arabia 
Crown 
Prince Mohammed Bin-Salman, 
Russian 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin 
and 
other 
murderous 
despots, the Democrats have a 
prime opportunity to call out 
Republicans for their complicity in 
both financing murder of foreign 
civilians and creating a more 
dangerous world for Americans. 
Though the issues feel more 
abstract when they’re far from 
American shores, it only takes a 
smart communications team to 
connect the dots and transform 
this into a key messaging tactic. 
Americans should feel secure 
in their decision to vote for 
Democrats, knowing they are the 
best party to serve their interests 
domestically and abroad.

I

t seems like every six months 
there is a new holiday that 
spends an entire day absolutely 
obliterating social media feeds. Last 
week, #GivingTuesday took its 
turn in this newly created digital 
spotlight, prompting me to wonder 
where #GivingTuesday came from 
and what #GivingTuesday can tell 
us about the current state of charity 
work.
#GivingTuesday’s rise has been 
nothing short of meteoric. In 2012, 
just after being founded by the 
United Nations Foundation and 
92nd Street Y, #GivingTuesday was 
able to raise an “inspiring” $10.1 
million. This past week, only six 
years later, #GivingTuesday raised 
a whopping $380 million. In 2012, 
Mashable was “thrilled” about the 
“new annual celebration” that “is 
less about buying gifts and more 
about giving back,” referring to 
the mass consumerism and abject 
purchasing that occurs every Black 
Friday and Cyber Monday.
But how did #GivingTuesday 
become 
such 
a 
phenomenon? 
And why does it seem to exist 
almost solely on social media? 
The 
answer 
is 
actually 
quite 
simple; 
from 
#GivingTuesday’s 
inception, “the movement” was 
able to score partnerships with a 
litany of powerful technology and 
social media companies. Its official 
sponsors include the likes of Skype, 
Cisco, Microsoft, Sony, Mashable, 
Facebook, The Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation and Google Plus. 
#GivingTuesday’s 
digital 
strategy can be seen in every 
part of the movement. In fact, on 
#GivingTuesday’s official website 
says “#GivingTuesday harnesses 
the potential of social media.” One 
also doesn’t really have to look past 
the name, which officially has a 
hashtag in it (cringe), to see that 
#GivingTuesday was tailor-made 
for social media.
On the surface, #GivingTuesday 
seems like it is not much more than 
a shining example of the more noble 
potentials of social media. While 
the positive material outcomes of 
#GivingTuesday are undeniable, 
it’s important that we don’t allow 
corporate-created social projects to 
exist solely in their desired state of 
unbounded positivity.

I can’t help but feel a cold draft 
rush into the room when I think 
about 
the 
advanced 
publicity 
chess 
move 
that 
sponsoring 
#GivingTuesday is for a company 
like Facebook. It is no secret that 
Facebook has been under massive 
amounts of public scrutiny ever 
since the 2016 election. Of course 
every corporation is invested in 
maintaining its public image, but it’s 
important to understand that image 
is far more important for social 
media companies than almost any 
other type of company.
Facebook 
does 
not 
actually 
sell people a product, nor do they 
actually provide anything that 
cannot easily be replicated; someone 
halfway through a computer science 
degree could recreate Facebook from 
scratch. The entire value of Facebook 
comes solely from the fact that other 
people use Facebook. Essentially, 
anyone can create a Facebook 2.0, 
but it’s nearly impossible to convince 
billions of people to sign on. It’s this 
dynamic that puts Facebook at a 
very uncomfortable crossroad.
I wonder how many board 
meetings Facebook has had on this 
exact topic: If people say they hate 
Facebook so much, why do they 
keep using it? Or rather, why don’t 
they stop using Facebook? There are 
tons of interesting potential answers 
to this question, but, for Facebook, 
#GivingTuesday is a solution. By 
supporting #GivingTuesday and 
making Facebook a fundraising 
friendly website (started in 2017) 
in general, people start to view 
Facebook with a sense of idealism 
and as a place where organizing and 
sharing thoughts to help those in 
need is easy and abundant.
In short, Facebook’s shift toward 
philanthropy seems to fit a timeline 
in which Facebook wants people to 
think of Facebook less as a place filled 
with fake news and conservative 
radicalization and more as a place 
that helps facilitate the homeless to 
get their next meal. It may be unfair 
to cast Facebook’s philanthropy 
efforts 
as 
being 
completely 
disingenuous, but it is also unfair 
to ignore #GivingTuesday as a 
publicity stunt for Facebook and 
tech companies alike.
The broader idea of creating 
a charitable movement around 

social media also reads as deeply 
troubling and reflective of the hyper-
individualized times in which we 
live. The best and most ethical ways 
of giving back have been debated 
by 
philosophers 
and 
religious 
communities for thousands of years, 
but most people agree charitable 
acts should center on those in need, 
not those who are giving.
The central tenet of social 
media is for people to express their 
individuality: to share with the 
world what you are doing, to tell 
everyone what you are thinking 
about, to have everyone see you in all 
your beauty. If we agree the highest 
forms of charity revolve around 
unrewarded self-sacrifice, doesn’t a 
platform designed for self-praising 
seem like a really weird place “to 
do” charity? 
After 
perusing 
the 
#GivingTuesday 
website 
for 
a while, I started to wonder 
if 
#GivingTuesday 
saw 
a 
way for people to give back 
by 
non-monetary 
means. 

#GivingTuesday 
does 

recommend and provides truly 
useful tools for finding local 
charities at which volunteer. But 
#GivingTuesday also suggests 
people post a “#UNselfie” in 
which they take a selfie of them 
doing charitable work and attach 
#GivingTuesday and #UNselfie 
to their social media post.
At 
every 
turn 
it 
appears 
#GivingTuesday is a charitable 
movement 
that 
is 
sustained 
by a matrix of self-interest. 
From a rough and zoomed-out 
perspective, it seems that our 
critical response to the consumer 
capitalism that occurs on Black 
Friday and Cyber Monday is 
to participate in a corporately-
sustained social media campaign 
that allows us to tell our friends 
how much money we gave to 
charity. My point is not that 
contributing to #GivingTuesday 
is 
necessarily 
unethical, 
but 
rather that #GivingTuesday is 
the perfect yet slightly terrifying 
symbol of altruism in postmodern 
times.

How #GivingTuesday became the selfie of altruism

W

e live in a country so 
polarized that it’s hard 
to imagine having a 
civil conversation with someone 
who voted differently than you did. 
This is a problem.
Polarization, to put it simply, 
characterizes the trend in American 
politics in which Republicans and 
Democrats agree on less and less. 
A polarized political body is one 
that can’t compromise. Polarization 
is 
deeply 
concerning 
for 
any 
democracy. Polarization stymies 
policy from being legislated and 
thus can undermine democracy 
to the point of decay. The Weimar 
Republic, Germany’s experiment 
with 
democracy 
before 
Adolf 
Hitler, was undermined deeply by 
polarization caused by political 
factions that couldn’t compromise. 
Leading up to Hitler’s appointment 
as chancellor, the polarization had 
gotten so bad that the Reichstag, the 
German legislature, was unable to 
pass legislation. Thus, the German 
president relied on unilateral action 
through executive decrees, akin 
to our executive orders, which 
helped pave the way for Hitler’s 
abuses of executive power and the 
rise of the Third Reich. We should 
all be concerned by the damage 
polarization is doing to the efficacy 
and health of our democratic system.
There are whole classes and 
entire books on the source of political 
polarization in America. Some say 
it’s the changing demographics and 
the approach to a majority-minority 
nation, which I reject as essentialist 
thinking that demonstrates racism. 
There’s nothing inherent about 
having a smaller white majority that 
means our politics will be polarized. 
Others say it’s social media and the 
news cycle, which might be true 
— but it’s not like we can get rid of 
social media or the 24/7 news cycle. 
Regardless of the sources of the 
polarization, I can think there’s one 
pretty straightforward way we can 
alleviate polarization.
To 
lessen 
polarization, 
we 
should lessen political hobbyism. 
Political hobbyism is defined by 
political scientist Eitan Hersch as 
“a degraded form of politics that 
caters to the voyeurism of news 
junkies and the short attention span 

of slacktivists.” Political hobbyism is 
the politics born of a 24/7 news cycle, 
with social media and the internet 
cluttering your home screen with 
notifications. 
Political 
hobbyists 
have a relationship with politics akin 
to sports fan with sports. Like avid 
sports fans, political hobbyists have 
an insatiable interest in politics and 
a strong emotional investment in 
politics. But this interest in politics 
only serves to provide immediate 
emotional gratification — either 
boiling outrage or fervent support — 
while killing an intent to act in any 
meaningful way. A political hobbyist 
will know all about what’s going on, 
tweet voraciously about politics, 
then call it a night.
Political hobbyism creates an 
outrage culture that fuels the 
atmosphere of polarization. When 
politics is a sports-like hobby, people 
lose sight of the purpose of being 
politically aware in the first place. 
Knowledge of politics should be to 
serve political action. If an issue is 
really important to you, then you 
should use the knowledge you have 
about it to take action in whatever 
way you can. In a democracy, political 
actions should be ultimately geared 
toward effecting change, of which 
changing minds and mobilizing 
people 
is 
often 
instrumental. 
This 
could 
be 
done 
through 
voting, volunteering for political 
organizations, engaging in dialogues 
as rationally and respectfully as 
possible, fundraising, etc. Anything 
that does not serve, even indirectly, 
the advancement of issues you care 
about through legislation or the 
enactment of policies is not legitimate 
political action in my opinion.
I witnessed a good example of 
non-hobbyist political action at a 
teach-in on immigration under the 
Trump administration. An organizer 
spoke about protesting a speech by 
an anti-immigration spokesperson 
held by the University’s chapter of 
College Republicans. The intent was 
to change the minds of the people in 
the audience, not to simply express 
outrage and deem the speaker and 
audience members terrible people. 
The protestors planned to wield 
signs with facts and images of asylum 
seekers to refute the speaker’s anti-
immigrant arguments.

It’s 
not 
that 
you 
shouldn’t 
use heated language or speak 
passionately, even angrily, or that you 
shouldn’t tweet about politics. But 
you should draw a line where you 
think you could no longer convince 
a person to agree with you. Getting 
mad at someone for thinking 
something you find offensive is 
understandable. But if you get 
apoplectic, the conversation has been 
supplanted by a shouting match, and 
that person will never agree with 
you. Nothing is stopping the spread 
of ideological polarization when 
people don’t care about achieving 
compromise through dialogues and 
rational exchanges. Remembering 
that compromise is an indispensable 
modality of democracy could check 
ideologues and the theatrics of 
political hobbyists that further 
polarizes our politics.
German philosopher Friedrich 
Nietzsche thought history needed 
to be used only to help the living 
act in the present. A student who 
studied history excessively would 
have no will to take action, because 
they would spend all of their time 
and energy reconstructing and 
studying the past. The proper 
use of history is to inspire novel 
pursuits in the present and future. 
Political hobbyists, which all of 
us are to some degree, should 
consider 
adopting 
this 
advice 
to their relationship to politics. 
Interest in politics should primarily 
be about readying yourself to act in 
accordance with your beliefs and 
interests, of which changing minds 
is often paramount to achieve in 
our democratic system. Growth is a 
facet of all human experience. Were 
you the same person, with the same 
views, three years ago? I definitely 
wasn’t. Keep this in mind when 
talking to people who disagree with 
you. Just because they don’t agree 
with you now doesn’t mean they 
won’t ever change their mind. If we 
reframe how we think about politics 
to be rooted in taking action, we can 
take an important step to alleviating 
the polarization that is tearing our 
country apart.

C

ongress has finally taken 
some action on climate 
change, and the solution is 
exactly what we’ve been hoping for.
On Nov. 28, three Republicans 
and three Democrats introduced 
the Energy Innovation and Carbon 
Dividend Act of 2018 in the House 
of Representatives. This bill, viewed 
as a free market solution to climate 
change, is revenue neutral, adds 2.1 
million jobs to the U.S. economy and 
gives American taxpayers hundreds of 
dollars each month. Oh yeah, it’ll also 
cut United States carbon emissions by 
40 percent in 12 years, which is on par 
with what the International Panel on 
Climate Change recommends to keep 
global warming limited to 1.5 degrees 
Celsius.
Sounds a little too good to be true, 
right? Here’s how it works:
Carbon Fee
The policy puts a fee on fuels like 
coal, oil and gas at the source. As soon 
as the fuel is drawn, a $15 per ton fee 
will be added to the price. With each 
year, the fee will grow by $10 to create 
a progressive policy. Because the 
price of carbon would increase due 
to the fee, energy prices for coal, oil 
and gas would increase as well. This 
would act as a market-equalizer by 
incorporating the environmental cost 
of these fuels. As the price of carbon 
fuels increases relative to the price of 
renewable energy, renewable energy 
will become a more economical 
option for households. As a result, 
the demand for renewable energy 
will increase and companies will be 
incentivized to invest in renewable 
technologies that are not subject to 
the tax.
Carbon Dividend
It’s important that it’s a carbon fee, 

not a tax. All of the money collected 
from the fee will be given back to the 
American people at the end of each 
month — not diverted to any other 
programs. Because each American 
gets the same amount of money, 
this policy will actually offer some 
benefits to the middle and lower 
classes. It’s estimated 53 percent 
of households will receive more 
dividend money than they spend on 
energy costs at the end of the month. 
Program costs will also be taken 
out of the funds collected by the fee. 
The dividend would be given to the 
people as a general transfer of funds, 
meaning Americans would be able to 
spend their money as they see fit.
Border Carbon Adjustment
To protect U.S. manufacturers 
and jobs, imported goods will also 
be subject to the carbon fee. As 
a result, manufacturers will be 
disincentivized to move overseas to 
avoid the fee. American goods that are 
exported will receive a refund for the 
carbon fee under this policy.
Regulatory Adjustment
The policy prevents redundant 
carbon regulations as long as the 
targets are being met. Regulations on 
auto mileage and other pollutants will 
not be affected.
This policy is the best way for 
the United States to amp up its fight 
against climate change. But first, 
it needs to get passed in Congress. 
That might sound like a pretty big 
order, especially with our current 
government, but there are ways that 
you (yes, you!) can have a real impact 
on the political conversation about 
climate change.
The most important thing you 
can possibly do is call or write your 
representative and tell them you 

support this bill. Though it might 
seem like representatives don’t care 
what you think, they definitely do. 
Your vote decides whether they 
have a job in two years, and they are 
responsible for representing your 
interests on the national stage. Hold 
them to that.
There 
are 
also 
several 
environmental groups that focus 
on climate activism. I’m a part 
of the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of Citizen’s Climate Lobby, 
an international organization that 
focuses on speaking to representatives 
to advocate for the bipartisan passage 
of the Energy Innovation and 
Carbon Dividend Act. Through 
this organization, I’ve had the 
opportunity to go to Washington, 
D.C., and speak with Michigan 
senators and House representatives. 
There are also groups like Climate 
Blue, Students for Clean Energy and 
the Climate Action Movement at the 
University that advocate for campus 
sustainability.
Our climate can’t wait for us 
to make slow change. The IPCC 
Report and the recent U.S. Climate 
Report say we don’t have that much 
time left if we want to stay below 
1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. We 
need to see widespread community 
action to drive policy if we are 
going to protect our future and our 
children’s future. The best way to 
do that right now is to get Congress 
to pass the Energy Innovation and 
Carbon Dividend Act. We’ve been 
taking baby steps to combat climate 
change. It’s high time for us to start 
sprinting.

As we grow up and toss out 
the old tools that crafted our 
talents, we forget the elegance 
and potential that built our skills. 
We look at the amateur as no 
different from a child on training 
wheels, someone incapable of 
mastery without the more efficient 
gadgets built specifically for the 
job. It’s almost as though our 
accomplishments are just as much 
our tools as they are our work. 
But what if we master the art of 
the amateur? Bring revolutionary 
creations to fruition with the 
same gizmos that manufactured 
less flashy prototypes? Does that 
make it less valid, less worthy of 
recognition?
Steve Lacy has built his career 
from the one app even amateur 
musicians eschew: Garageband. 
Growing up in Compton, Cali., he 
never expected himself to produce 
the track “Pride” for native 
Kendrick Lamar’s Pulitzer Prize 
winning DAMN.. “Here I was just 
creating music — I had no idea 
what for. It was just — it felt right,” 
he says of some demos he produced 
on his iPhone. But all that “iPhone 
stuff” scored him major gigs, 
from operating as co-executive 
producer and guitarist for the 
band The Internet to collaborating 
with J. Cole. He often jokes about 
getting all the glory before the age 
of 20: “So this is the ‘Curse’ demo 
that would go on to lead me into 
a Grammy nomination in high 
school for an album I couldn’t tour 
— because I was in high school,” he 
says of his accomplishments in his 
TED talk.
Lacy has accomplished more 
in 20 years than many musicians 
do in a lifetime, bringing an 
underground, overlooked sound 
into the mainstream with critical 
acclaim. The thing is, you probably 
didn’t even notice. Heck, this might 
even be your first time hearing 

his name. But I’m sure — no, I’m 
positive — you’ve heard his music 
before. I speak from experience. 
I discovered Steve Lacy after 
listening to Kali Uchis’s “Just a 
Stranger,” his voice distinct against 
her high-pitched crooning. Uchis’s 
album 
Isolation 
soundtracked 
much of 2018 for me, its tones and 
energies hazy but emotive enough 
to fit any situation. But something 
about that song with Lacy in 
particular stuck out to me: It wasn’t 
afraid to be funky and bold. As 
Uchis and Lacy faintly sang “dollar 
bills” on loop in the background, it 
felt as though their voices moved 
sonically from one headphone to 
the other like a pendulum. The 
bass was sticky and gave the song 
an earthier element against the 
psychedelic production. But it was 
the attention to detail and nuance 
that really got me. I’m still not over 
the effects with the line: “She’s a 
hurricane / Feel the earth shake,” 
Uchis’s voice echoic against a 
moment of silence before a crash 
reanimates the beat with the word 
“shake.” The lyrics and music 
worked in parallel to one another.
When I looked up to see who 
exactly this Steve Lacy was, I 
realized he was not only the track’s 
mastermind producer, but that 
I’ve heard his music before. He 
was there the dozen or so times I 
listened to DAMN.. Goldlink’s At 
what Cost impressed me enough 
for “Crew” and “Some Girl” to earn 
honorable slots in my playlists; 
Lacy produced the latter. He 
even co-produced and sung in my 
all-time favorite song off Tyler, 
The Creator’s Flower Boy, “911 / 
Mr. Lonely”; I was thoroughly 
convinced those vocals belonged to 
Frank Ocean, despite the crediting 
of both. I could go on, but I think 
you get the point. Lacy simply has a 
magic of marrying his own distinct 
style of production with that of 
the artists he’s working with. Few 
collaborators, if any, devote that 
level of care. 
It’s easy to excuse Steve Lacy’s 

talent as a behind-the-scenes 
appeal, an artistry not made 
for fame. After all, producers 
like Pharrell and Calvin Harris 
brought their names to our 
attention 
through 
producing 
and singing their own songs. 
However, Lacy has done the same 
and hasn’t received the same 
recognition. His 2017 EP Steve 
Lacy’s Demo was developed on his 
lonesome and received widespread 
critical acclaim. It was notable 
for its sophistication despite the 
suggestions of his age, a cohesive, 
elegant telling of young love in lo-fi, 
funk and soul. 
The second and third tracks off 
the EP, “RYD” and “DARK RED,” 
best display this. Their union in 
a singular music video embody 
the shifty nature of a teenage 
relationship, how tremulously it 
clings to a sense of certainty in 
inexperience. The swagger of his 
suggestive, hazy crooning in a 
laundromat fizzles to him asking 
his girlfriend: “If she was hungry 
does she want any food?” This 
waning confidence in “RYD” 
effortlessly flows into the brisk 
insecurity of “DARK RED” as 
Lacy ponders, trapped in a truck, 
“Something bad is ‘bout to happen 
to me / I don’t know what, but I feel 
it coming.” The duality and fluidity 
of the subject is all encompassing, 
down to the video’s night and day 
settings. But it never feels forced, 
never dignified — Lacy’s appeal is 
subtle, obvious without trying too 
hard to be profound. 
Steve Lacy epitomizes the spirit 
of a true artist in his capacity 
to work against his limitations, 
regardless of whether this is his 
inexperience or restriction to an 
iPhone. His music explores the 
multifaceted hallmarks of youth 
in unwavering detail, unafraid 
of expressing the anxiety and 
dejection that ensues. Despite 
a lack in recognition, his nearly 
ubiquitous influence on modern 
music indicates he is certain for the 
impact he strives for.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Steve Lacy is the mastered amateur

It is frankly absurd how little 
known SSION’s (pronounced: 
“shun”) name is. With the 
release of his third studio album 
O earlier this year, SSION (also 
known 
as 
Cody 
Critcheloe) 
cemented himself as one of the 
most 
innovative 
pop 
artists 
of our generation. Featuring 
a mix of punk, pop, funk and 
electronic 
music, 
his 
work 
provides unprecedented variety 
in comparison to 2018’s other 
releases. 
SSION is truly the jack-of-all-
trades in the music world, not 
only producing insanely catchy 
hooks and arrangements but 
also creating visual components 

to accompany his work and the 
work of others (see: Robyn). An 
artist who is constantly at work, 
SSION has already released ones 
for “Comeback,” “At Least The 
Sky Is Blue” and “Inherit.” In this 
sense, O is an album that feels 
modern without forgetting its 
roots in rock ‘n’ roll, marrying the 
visual nature of the 21st century 
with the necessity of the album’s 
punk atmosphere. 
SSION’s greatest strength lies 
in his prolific collaboration. Indie-
rock titan Ariel Pink is featured 
on the tender “At Least The Sky 
Is Blue,” while Devendra Banhart 
contributes 
to 
“Free 
Lunch 
(Break).” SSION was even able 
to pull an appearance from pop’s 
avoidant queen Sky Ferreira, who 
appears on standout “1980-99,” 
which happened to be her first 

new material in the long years 
following her release of Night 
Time, My Time. 
Yet, it is the unapologetic 
queer representation in his art 
that is most important. Other 
album standout “Marc and Me” 
takes us on a fictional evening 
spent with none other than 
Marc Jacobs, and SSION has 
historically presented his queer 
identity in his previous work. It’s 
undoubtedly critical for art to 
support minority representation 
in 
today’s 
world, 
providing 
confidence and comfort where it 
has been typically absent; SSION 
is an artist of necessity, not just 
for his multi-faceted, entirely 
unique arrangements, but also 
for the positive representation of 
queer culture he so masterfully 
conveys.

Middle Kids make the kind 
of indie rock that will always 
have a place in the genre: 
It’s 
bright, 
poignant 
and 
has a sense of grit that lies 
hidden underneath brilliant 
harmonies 
until 
the 
right 
moment 
comes. 
With 
the 
2018 release of Lost Friends, 

their 
first 
studio 
LP, 
the 
Australian 
band 
cemented 
themselves in the industry 
with their strengths on full 
display. Made up of recently-
married couple Hannah Joy 
(vocals, piano) and Tim Fitz 
(guitar), with drummer Harry 
Day, Middle Kids take the 
basics of indie rock to new 
heights. While the group is 
still relatively unknown, they 
have found surprising fans in 

those who have discovered 
them, 
including 
legendary 
pop musician Elton John. His 
support of their single “Edge 
of Town” resulted in the first 
burst of buzz around their 
debut album. 
The group’s first release, a 
2017 self-titled EP, introduced 
them to the music scene on a 
high note. A few of the songs 
from that original collection 
were re-worked for the album, 

CLARA SCOTT
Daily Arts Writer

Middle Kids don’t take the easy route

and the band’s growth is clear 
even over only a year’s time. 
If anything, Middle Kids have 
an innate talent for skillful 
variety, something that keeps 
the listener engaged and the 
musicians constantly on their 
game. While all of their music 
carries the same flavor of 
classic indie rock and similar 
instrumentation 
across 
the 
board, the band manages to 
imbue each of their songs with 
a different tilt and feeling, 
connecting their discography 
while also making sure no two 
lines sound exactly the same. 
The dynamics of the band 
lend themselves clearly and 
effectively to their music, as 
the closeness between Joy and 
Fitz allows the songwriters to 
tackle difficult and complex 

issues as a team, assessing 
their 
own 
issues 
through 
profound lyrics and anthemic 
ballads. This is all but obvious 
in 
songs 
like 
“Don’t 
Be 
Hiding,” a tune that meshes 
its unique and catchy melody 
with words that pack a serious 
punch. “You don’t have to sell 
it I am sold,” Joy sings, “So 
give me all your garbage and 
gold.” Many of Middle Kids’s 
songs hold similarly powerful 
meaning, each one offering 
three to five minutes of escape 
and immersion to anyone who 
cares to listen. 
That care for emotional 
detail and poetry is supported 
by 
the 
group’s 
collective 
experience 
in 
music 
as 
professionally 
trained 
instrumentalists — Joy is a 

classical pianist, Fitz plays 
a myriad of instruments and 
Day studied jazz at the Sydney 
Conservatorium 
of 
Music. 
Their experience with classical 
music may seem unconnected 
to their current pursuits in 
the world of indie rock, but to 
the trained ear, it’s plain to see 
why their songs work so well. 
The band doesn’t take the easy 
route melodically, a trait that 
enhances their work’s stream-
of-consciousness assessments 
of life with fascinating musical 
twists and turns. Their songs 
range 
from 
stadium-ready 
atmospheric 
rock 
to 
quiet 
piano 
musings 
and 
cover 
everything in between with an 
ease that feels like they always 
existed, pulled from the air by 
the band’s expert hands. 

In Ancient Greek mythology, 
creatures known as sirens were said 
to have lured sailors to their watery 
deaths with their enchanting, 
ethereal voices. These sirens now 
seem distant, residing merely 
within the fantastical tales from 
antiquity. It wasn’t until I heard 
the surreal, hypnotizing serenade 
of Emily Wells that I understood 
how those poor sailors could throw 
their lives away for a voice. 
Wells is an artist like no other. 
Her music is so singular, it can only 
be loosely contained within the 
usual wheel of characterizations: a 

mix of R&B and haunting ballads, 
electronic 
ambiance 
balanced 
with classical orchestration of 
whining strings and hypnotic 
drum beats, surreal synth lines, 
soft touches of jazz. Her songs 
recall a hundred different names 
and a hundred different genres. 
In fact, the first time her voice 
drifted into my previously-empty 
existence, I immediately thought 
of Amy Winehouse’s modern-jazz 
ballads and arresting vocals. But 
within the next moment, I had 
decided Winehouse was no longer 
a sufficient comparison. By the 
end of that fateful introduction in 
“Mama’s Gonna Give You Love,” 
I was drawing blanks trying 
articulate what it means to let 

Wells draw you into her dream-
like embrace. Even now, I fear this 
attempt to capture her essence 
falls painfully short of the reality 
of the experience she painstakingly 
crafts. 
A siren: The comparison seems 
more fitting with every passing 
moment. Wells often appears to 
be a mythical, haunting creature 
who belongs more in some divine, 
alternate reality than among the 
lackluster mortal-plane the rest of 
us inhabit. Emily Wells is a name 
deserving of “household status” 
— but just as she has ruthlessly 
captured my heart, I almost 
hesitate to raise her from obscurity. 
Once you hear Wells’s crooning, 
there is no escaping her siren’s call.

More underrated and overlooked artists of 2018

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

What is a bassoon? Is it 
that weird monkey with the 
pink butt? Is it that big rocket 
launcher-ish thing? 
If you perchance think a 
bassoon is either of these things, 
you are sadly mistaken — a 
bassoon is neither a baboon nor 
a bazooka. To most people, the 
bassoon is a big ol’ woodwind 
instrument 
that 
typically 
handles bass and tenor notes in 
orchestral music; however, to 
Euceph, both a School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance student and 
a 
severely 
underappreciated 
independent 
artist, 
the 
instrument is much more. 
With the release of his first 
EP Dirty Laundry in November 
of this year, Euceph introduced 
an 
unprecedented 
idea: 
a 

combination of the bassoon 
and downtempo house music. 
Downtempo house has become 
increasingly popular recently 
as a softer, more tasteful take 
on EDM. The genre relies on 
deep, smooth and rich notes that 
evoke energy without the typical 
electronic aggression of house 
music — surprisingly the perfect 
opportunity for a breathy, reed-
based instrument like a bassoon 
to excel. 
Dirty 
Laundry 
is 
both 
melodically 
pleasant 
and 
rhythmically 
sound, 
striking 
a 
delicate 
balance 
between 
beauty, groove and intensity 
that will tickle your ears from 
start to finish. The project’s 
most promising track “Pinkhat” 
features a bassline with a unique 
timbre, due to its bassoon-
based structure, that I can’t 
imagine it will avoid a Spotify-
curated playlist for much longer. 

Throughout the six-track EP, 
Euceph lifts the bassoon to its 
modern 
potential, 
shedding 
its orchestral credentials and 
taking advantage of its unique 
sound that has been virtually 
unheard of in popular music. 
Ironically, however, this total 
embrace of the bassoon might 
keep Euceph in the underground 
longer than necessary. Virtually 
every musical aspect of the 
EP, from the basslines to the 
melodies 
and 
everything 
in between, is recorded on 
bassoon. While interesting, the 
instrumental monotony shifts 
from exciting to uninteresting 
pretty quickly. To ensure that 
he lands a spot on that Spotify-
curated playlist, Euceph should 
combine

COURTESY OF THE ARTIST

Euceph bends the boundaries of bassoon

Paul Kelly is an interesting 
case. Acclaimed as a folk-
rock artist in Australia, he is 
not 
particularly 
well-known 
outside its borders. Perhaps 
his obscurity has to do with 
his work having a distinctively 
Australian tinge to it, but the 
fact remains that he is an elite 
and 
consistent 
songwriter 
who doesn’t really get the 
recognition he deserves. His 
popularity peaked in the late 
’80s and ’90s, but more recently, 
at the tender age of 63, Paul 
Kelly released his 24th studio 
album, Nature, on Oct. 12, 2018. 
Kelly’s 
sense 
of 
melody 
and 
harmonic 
structure 
is 
masterful, 
his 
arrangements 
mature and subtle. He rejects 
the 
fashionable 
irony 
that 
pervades modern art in favor 
of thoroughly-uncool sincerity 
and optimism, and through 
said sincerity he has created 
something deeply human and 
democratic with Nature.
The love song is one of the 
easiest types to write, but it 
is one of the most difficult to 

write well. Paul Kelly manages 
to succeed in accomplishing the 
latter on “With The One I Love,” 
the best song on the album and 
one of the best songs of the year. 
“Bound to Follow” is another 
highlight, a slow burn based on 
the lyrical theme of following 
after a mysterious love who is 
eternally beyond reach. A female 
vocalist takes over the chorus; 
the actual words she is singing 
are indecipherable, evoking the 
sense of Kelly chasing after the 
woman he dreams of. 
As one might guess from the 
title, nature is a theme that runs 
through this album. Much as 
nature contains both beauty 
and 
menace, 
enlightenment 
and the void, the first half 
of the album is composed 
of harmonies mingled with 
snarling, baleful licks on songs 
like “A Bastard Like Me.” The 
second half is relatively languid 
and balmy, both lyrically and 
instrumentally. 
“Seagulls 
in 
Seattle,” for example, opens 
with the lines “I was walking by 
the water / My heart full aching 
sore / The seagulls of Seattle / 
Wheeled above the shore” over 
a finger-picked acoustic guitar, 
swelling 
steel 
pedal 
guitar 

mimicking the movement of 
the birds. Love and nature are 
one and the same, holy and 
paramount to Kelly’s ontology. 
Throughout 
Nature, 
Kelly 
interpolates 
several 
famous 
poems for his lyrics, such 
as 
“Death 
Shall 
Have 
No 
Dominion,” by Dylan Thomas, 
and “Mushrooms,” by Sylvia 
Plath. Counterintuitively, the 
inclusion of others’ lyrics makes 
Nature even more personal, as 
though Kelly is reharmonizing 
and reciting to you the works of 
others that have had an impact 
upon him. Thomas’s poem in 
particular sounds as though it 
was destined to be used in this 
manner, its themes of life, death, 
love and nature brought to life 
by Kelly’s keen understanding of 
the rhetorical effect of harmony. 
There 
is 
nothing 
performative 
or 
conceited 
about Nature; instead, there is 
a sense that Kelly’s creation is 
inspired by nothing more and 
nothing less than his desire for 
self-expression. It feels like a 
dusty record in a bin that you 
found in the back of a shop, a 
forgotten work of art that is all 
the more beautiful for having 
been forgotten.

FILM REVIEW

‘Mirai’ portrays family 
dynamics with thought

In 
“Mirai,” 
a 
Japanese 
toddler, Kun, (Jaden Waldman 
“Pinkalicious”) 
has 
his 
life 
turned upside down by his new 
sister, Mirai (Victoria Grace, “47 
Ronin”). Mirai is the catalyst for 
Mamoru Hosoda’s newest film, 
an intriguing survey of what 
it means to be a family, how 
individual histories becomes 
part 
of 
a 
collective 
story 
and what that means for the 
youngest members just learning 
to appreciate the world.
“Mirai” challenges familial 
gender roles — instead of Kun’s 
mom (Rebecca Hall, “Professor 
Martson 
and 
the 
Wonder 
Women”) staying home to take 
care of the family, it is his dad 
(John Cho, “Searching”) who 
struggles to balance his job as 
a freelance architect with his 
responsibilities as a father. The 
movie highlights the pressures 
of being new parents and uses 
the relationship between Kun’s 
parents as a way to single out 
fathers who only talk about 
how much they do in the house, 
rather than actually doing it. 
This also sets the stage for a 
satisfying character arc for 
Kun’s father: He eventually 
becomes more concerned with 
actually raising his kids than 

with whether or not the whole 
neighborhood knows what he’s 
doing. 
The importance of family is 
a recurring theme that we see 
in a lot of films — particularly 
in children’s films. But the fact 
that it’s animated doesn’t, or at 
least shouldn’t, automatically 
relegate 
“Mirai” 
to 
the 

children’s movie genre. Often, 
in the United States, we forget 
that animated films can be more 
than just physical comedy and 
jokes — they can be sharply 
satirical or introspective and 
just as much of a “film” as any 
movie with actual, physical 
actors. Even though, in recent 
years, films like “Zootopia” have 
tried to grapple with difficult 
topics like racism, the animated 
film industry in the United 
States is still heavily saturated 
with children’s movies whose 
underlying 
complexities 
are 
barely there or overtly comedic, 
and sometimes careless, “adult” 
animations. “Mirai,” however, 
delivers a very clear message 
about family in a sophisticated 
way — something that’s often 

missing in the ones coming from 
studios like Disney. “Mirai” 
strips away the layer of humor 
characteristic 
of 
Western 
animations and, instead, takes 
animation to a place where the 
story can truly grow.
Films like “Mirai” also serve 
as a reminder of the artistry 
necessary to develop any film, 
let alone an animated one. 
Lighting and camera direction 
are just two of the aspects of 
a scene that directors have to 
contend with or, in the case of 
an animated film, have to draw. 
The actual drawings in “Mirai” 
are simple when compared to 
movies like “Incredibles 2” or 
“Monsters, Inc.” But it’s this 
simplicity that allows “Mirai” 
to depict detailed emotions and 
develop a relationship with its 
audience. The animation is more 
of a plot device in “Mirai” than 
it is simply a genre. Though the 
beginning of the film is very one-
dimensional, towards the end, 
as Kun’s character matures, so 
does the level of animation. The 
Tokyo train station Kun finds 
himself in looks like a very real 
train station, but the characters 
still remain cartoons. Even 
within these drawings, though, 
the strangers at the station 
are dark shadows of adults 
while Kun maintains his bright 
colors, emphasizing the tension 
that has been building as Kun

grapples with his understanding 
of who he is in the new family 
hierarchy. 
“Mirai” is a moving film about 
individual hardships and the 

collective story they create in a 
family history. Its exploration 
of sibling relationships and 
the strain raising children can 
have on parents is a captivating 

and raw understanding of the 
messiness that’s integral to 
a family. But, in the words of 
Kun’s mom, everything is better 
when it’s messy.

Poole credits improvement to work with student manager

Jordan Poole once said he 
never missed three times in a 
row.
But five minutes into the 
Michigan men’s basketball game 
against North Carolina on Nov. 
28, he fired from beyond the arc, 
and the shot clanged out. It was 
the sophomore guard’s third 
consecutive misfire.
Two minutes later, Poole 
subbed out of the game. On the 
sideline, he found junior Andrew 
Jensen — a student manager on 
the team. Jensen reminded him 
to keep his guide hand straight. 
At halftime, Jensen watched 
closely as Poole went through 
warmups, reminding him each 
time to watch his guide hand 
and keep his follow-through 
locked in. Then he advised Poole 
to just keep shooting.
The adjustments worked. In 
the second half, Poole hit four 
threes and scored 15 points.

***

Student 
managers 
have 
a unique role in mentoring 
players. Like coaches, they see 
every practice, then watch and 
rewatch every game. They can 
pick out intricacies in a player’s 
habits — like Poole’s crooked 
guide hand. But unlike a coach, 
managers are often friends with 
the players off the court, adding 
an extra layer of depth to their 
relationship. That’s the case 
with Jensen and Poole.
The day they met was a simple 
case of being in the right place 
at the right time. But it’s grown 
into more than that.
“I needed a manager to 
work out when I first got here 
last year, coming in before my 
freshman year,” Poole said. “And 
he just happened to be in the 
gym. I introduced myself, he 
said he was Andrew and … we 
just always started to work out.”
Jensen was only there for a 
few days during the summer, but 

when the school year started up, 
Poole stuck with him. And this 
past summer, they took their 
relationship to a new level. They 
worked out together 2-3 times a 
day, working on 
Poole’s areas of 
inconsistency, 
such as shooting 
and 
ball-
handling.
“I was going 
through a spurt 
over the summer 
where 
I 
just 
really 
couldn’t 
make 
a 
shot,” 
Poole said. “ … 
We work out all 
the time so he really looks at 
how I shoot or how I dribble and 
he was like, ‘Yo, J, I think we 
need to get your handle tighter 

back, or start to get it tighter 
again.’
“And I looked at it and it 
was just something I kinda 
was overlooking at the time, 
but then when 
I really started 
to 
sit 
down 
and 
analyze 
I 
was 
like, 
‘For 
sure, yeah, we 
definitely need to 
… start working 
on 
my 
ball-
handling,’ 
and 
we’ve been doing 
that and we’ve 
been 
dedicated 
ever since.”
Jensen noticed that Poole 
often didn’t keep his head up 
or go at full speed during ball-
handling drills. While shooting, 

he had a tendency to release his 
off hand, which made the ball go 
left. Poole got frustrated when 
shots frequently bounced to the 
left and Jensen told him exactly 
what was wrong. 
Poole listened.
That 
trust 
didn’t 
come 
right away. At 
first, Poole was 
overconfident. 
Jensen 
still 
remembers 
how, that first 
summer, 
Poole 
would 
say 
that 
he 
never 
missed 
three 
times in a row and other, 
similar declarations. With that 
overconfidence came an original 
hesitance about Jensen’s skill.

But when he underestimated 
Jensen and it knocked him 
down a peg, it fueled Poole’s 
competitiveness and drive to 
improve.
“Me 
and 
another 
manager, 
Zach, 
we guarded him 
a lot, so he was 
able to work on 
his 
one-on-one 
skills,” 
Jensen 
said. “And I think 
that 
he 
didn’t 
think we were 
actually capable 
defenders 
because we were 
managers, but we both played 
in high school so I think he was 
a little bit surprised by us. So 
we always give it to him when 

we get stops and he gets a little 
upset about that, but usually he 
comes back and he scores on us.”
And as they worked together 
more and more on the court, 
they also got closer off it — 
their favorite pastime is playing 
Call of Duty: Zombies. Their 
friendship allowed Poole and 
Jensen to come up with creative 
drills tailored to the other, but 
more importantly, it developed a 
sense of trust between the two 
that wouldn’t be present with a 
coach.
“We’re both able to be honest 
with each other,” Jensen said. 
“And I think that’s important in 
a relationship like this. … A lot of 
people in his position probably 
wouldn’t listen to a manager, but 
him, it’s just different. I’m able 
to critique him and he accepts 
that.”
Now, if Poole’s shot is off 
during a game, Jensen knows 
he can tap Poole on the shoulder 
and give a simple message: Fix 
it.
Poole almost certainly will.

***

In recent weeks, Michigan 
coach John Beilein has praised 
Poole’s improvement on ball-
handling. In that game against 
the Tar Heels, Poole had four 
assists but no turnovers. And 
after missing those first three 
shots, he finished 5-for-8 from 
beyond the arc. On Saturday, 
he followed it up with a 5-for-
5 performance on 3-pointers 
against Purdue.
It’s a process, and Poole won’t 
have perfect shooting or ball-
handling overnight. But when 
asked about his improvements, 
he’s quick to note he didn’t do it 
alone.
“It’s 
definitely 
been 
something that I’ve been ... 
amping up over the summer 
but especially these past couple 
weeks,” Poole said on Friday. 
“It’s (because of) a manager on 
the team that I’m good friends 
with. His name’s Andrew.”

‘M’ faces Minnesota in speed battle

Fast, skilled and newly helmed 
— Minnesota has all the tools to be 
great, though its 4-6-2 record might 
show otherwise.
The 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 
(6-6-3 overall, 2-3-3 Big Ten) faces 
off against the Golden Gophers 
on Friday and Saturday in what 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson thinks 
is a crucial time of the year.
There’s no doubt the start of the 
season, with a .500 record, is not the 
direction the team had envisioned. 
So with the last stretch of the first 
half being a home series right before 
the holiday break, the Wolverines 
view it as a good point to turn things 
around and use the mid-season end 
as a gateway to positive momentum.
“Absolutely, we’re still looking 
for a weekend that’s gonna turn 
things around,” said senior forward 
Brendan Warren. “We all know 
what we have to do, we all have to 
get on the same page, and I think 
this would be a good weekend for 
that and hopefully we can get some 
crucial points for the Big Ten and get 
us some confidence and get us on a 
roll going into Christmas.”
The confidence boost isn’t a given, 
though.
Despite a subpar start, Minnesota 
is noted to be one of the fastest teams 
in the conference, and in Pearson’s 
eyes, the quickest in the country. Put 

simply, the Golden Gophers know 
how to skate.
“They’ve always been one of the 
quickest teams in the country so they 
like to use their speed,” Pearson said. 
“Obviously, they’re in a transition 
with a new coach but that’s the 
biggest thing. We have to make sure 
we’re slowing them down.”
Slowing them down will be key, 
because first-year Minnesota coach 
Bob Motzko has implemented a style 
of play that best utilizes the team’s 
strengths. With speed obviously at 
their advantage, the Golden Gophers 
force a run-and-gun style on the 
ice, which causes both teams to 
constantly go up and down the rink.
It’s a style not unlike Michigan’s 
own. Also noted for their speed, 
the Wolverines often run the ice to 
try to get the upper hand in a fast-
paced battle. A slower pace could 
prove detrimental to Michigan, who 
equally relies on its speed to win 
games.
“We’re not a team that wants to 
play slow,” said senior defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi after a shootout 
loss to Michigan State. “We have 
too much speed in the front and the 
backend to play slow. To counter 
that, we just have to play fast. We 
tried to play fast. I thought we played 
fast, but we could play faster and 
stronger.”
The key for the Wolverines, 
however, is not to just play to its 
strengths, but to take away the 

Golden Gopher’s chances. Giving 
them less breathing room in the 
lanes creates turnovers that a fast 
team will often commit in the heat 
of action.
“We have to take their time and 
space away,” Pearson said. “We 
have to get a good start. We have not 
had great starts. We have had good 
starts. We’ve gotten the lead, but we 
have to sustain that.
“So I think the other thing is 
playing with the lead and trying to 
minimize the penalties too. We have 
to play a disciplined game, because 
they have a great power play because 
of their skill level. To me, they have 
the most skilled team in our league, 
players one through 27.”
To Michigan, the players try to 
approach it like any other game. 
The difference is that it is at home, a 
place that’s crucial in earning the Big 
Ten points needed to move up the 
standings.
“We got to start taking advantage 
of being at home,” Pearson said. “We 
can’t change what’s happened the 
last few weeks where we have a huge 
save, and then think of what we can 
do in points we need to get at some 
point in the Big Ten. They’re going 
to be tough every weekend, it just 
looks that way, so we need to take 
advantage of being at home. We’ve 
played well; we’ve played well. I 
want to emphasize that we have 
played well, we just haven’t finished 
and get those points we need.”

Wolverines roll against LIU Brooklyn in 83-38 win

There’s no place like home.
In front of its fans at Crisler 
Center for the first time since 
Nov. 19, the Michigan women’s 
basketball 
team 
snapped 
a 
two-game 
losing 
streak, 
steamrolling 
LIU 
Brooklyn 
(0-8) in an 83-38 victory. 
From the opening tip, the 
Wolverines 
(6-3) 
suffocated 
the Blackbirds, scoring at will 
inside the paint and starting 
the game on a 23-0 run. In 
addition to their imposing 
offensive frame, the defense 
proved 
just 
as 
competent, 
notching seven steals in the 
first quarter alone.
While they were held in 
check for the most part on their 
five-game road trip, Michigan’s 
star bigs — freshman Naz 
Hillmon and senior Hallie 
Thome — each produced, as 
Thome scored 11 points, with 
10 in the first half. Hillmon 
notched 24 and dominated 
the first frame with a 14-point 
performance that also saw her 
snag three offensive rebounds.
“We call her Naz-Zilla,” 
Thome joked after the game. 
“She is one of a kind.”
The game can, in essence, be 
summed up by four plays that 
took place midway through 
the first frame. With the 
score at 9-0 with just over 
six minutes to go, Hillmon 
checked in for Thome and 

promptly scored a layup off 
of an offensive rebound on 
her first possession. On the 
Wolverines’ next trip down the 
floor, sophomore guard Deja 
Church followed up a missed 
triple by senior forward Nicole 
Munger to score an easy layup 
of her own. 

Two plays later, Hillmon 
outmuscled 
Brooklyn 
defenders inside and scored 
a layup right off the inbound 
pass to stretch the lead to 15-0. 
With 2:16 left in the quarter, 
Hillmon 
notched 
another 
putback to make the score 21-0 
— a score line usually reserved 

for Saturday afternoons in Ann 
Arbor.
“Whenever I come in I just 
try to bring a lot of energy and 
intensity,” Hillmon said.
It 
was 
a 
dominant 
performance that was much-
needed for Michigan. After 
multiple road games against 

ranked opponents where the 
Wolverines finished 2-3, they 
were pushing for a dominant 
win. Against the Blackbirds, 
they got just that.
“Being 
back 
home 
and 
getting this win means a lot to 
us,” Hillmon said.
Perhaps one of the most 

important takeaways from the 
win was that Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico had the 
opportunity to get extended 
looks at some of her freshmen 
who do not normally see the 
floor, such as guards Ariel 
Young and Danielle Rauch. 
Even 
against 
a 
lackluster 
Brooklyn squad, getting game 
experience is always a huge 
plus for a team, especially one 
with so many young players 
waiting in the wings.
“It’s important any time 
they can get those minutes,” 
Barnes Arico said.
Michigan shot well from the 
field, making 43.6 percent of 
its field goals and 70 percent 
of its free throws. However, its 
3-point shooting remained an 
issue, with the team combining 
to make just one of its 16 
attempts. 
“That is not the strength of 
our team this year,” Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“It’s 
definitely 
an area where we need to 
improve and continue to work 
and hopefully that improves 
throughout the course of the 
season.”
While the Blackbird offense 
began to wake up in the 
second half, the margin that 
the Wolverines had created in 
the first half provided a large 
enough cushion, and they were 
able to take their foot off the 
gas and cruise to a comfortable, 
well-earned win after a tough 
road stretch. 

Lopsided win against LIU Brooklyn still serves a purpose

Thursday night at Crisler Center, 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team dismantled LIU Brooklyn, 
83-38.
As expected, the game was 
never close. The Wolverines (6-3) 
started the contest on a 23-0 run 
and held the Blackbirds (0-8) to just 
one point in the first quarter.
From the start, it was apparent 
the two programs were of totally 
different calibers. Top to bottom, 
Michigan had the advantage.
This was the case in the 
Wolverines’ first three matchups of 
the season; they pummeled Mount 
St. Mary’s, Western Michigan and 

Detroit Mercy. This is often the 
case during non-conference play, 
when schools that simply lack the 
resources and expertise to get top-
ranked players face Michigan.
Coaches love to talk about 
taking it one game at a time, no 
matter what. And this makes sense, 
because for the most part, anything 
can happen.
But 
some 
things 
usually 
don’t happen. For instance, the 
Wolverines 
smothered 
LIU 
Brooklyn, 86-49, a year ago, so even 
if they won’t say it explicitly, they 
came into Thursday’s game with a 
good inclination they would win. 
Many times early in the season, 
that is just how it is.
So, how does a team prepare for 

these uncontested contests?
Michigan 
made 
sure 
to 
incorporate some scouting reports 
on the Blackbirds into its gameplan, 
but the team primarily focused on 
the bigger picture.
In particular, the Wolverines 
could 
have 
concentrated 
on 
exploiting the height advantage 
as much as possible, however that 
strategy won’t work against more 
physical conference opponents. 
So instead, Michigan worked on 
a style of play that will be more 
suitable down the road.
“That’s what it has to be at this 
point,” said senior center Hallie 
Thome after the game. “We know 
that if the opponent isn’t gonna 
— I don’t wanna be rude — if the 

opponent isn’t the best, then we 
still gotta do the things that are 
gonna help us in the long run. 
So whether that’s covering back 
for transition defense, getting 
offensive rebounds, boxing out 
and doing all that stuff, the most 
important part is getting ready for 
Big Ten season.”
When 
playing 
a 
lesser 
opponent, teams sometimes start 
to 
lower 
expectations, 
which 
can be detrimental. Thursday’s 
game offered an opportunity to 
practice avoiding this. To motivate 
themselves, the Wolverines entered 
the game with a goal of getting 10 
stickers. A sticker is awarded for 

each charge taken or loose ball 
forced on defense.
“That kind of keeps you locked in 
on defense,” Thome said.
Despite this incentive, Thome 
mentioned the defense could have 
done a better job of sustaining 
the intensity. Following the single 
point allowed in the opening frame, 
Michigan gave up 18 points in the 
second quarter.
“In the beginning we set the 
tone,” Thome said. “But then we 
realized and started playing to our 
opponent — which is something we 
cannot do at all ‘cause a very good 
team, they’re gonna take advantage 
and then come back.”

Before the matchup against LIU 
Brooklyn, the Wolverines were 
on a tough stretch where they lost 
three out of four games. This win 
helped them head back in the right 
direction.
“I think for us — coming off the 
stretch that we had — we needed 
to get our confidence back,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico. 
“And we needed to go against an 
opponent. It didn’t matter who it 
was. We needed to find our way to 
playing Michigan basketball again.”
So while these lopsided games 
may not seem like much on the 
surface, they can still be useful; 
there are still lessons to be learned.
