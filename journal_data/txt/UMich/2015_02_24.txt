Universities see 
increase under 

Snyder, but express 
long-term concerns

By JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Following statewide elections in 

which higher education was a point 
of debate, this article is the first in 
a series examining the changing 
landscape of higher education fund-
ing in Michigan and what those 
changes mean for four-year univer-
sities.

When current Gov. Rick Sny-

der (R) assumed office in 2011, 
his administration cut 15 percent 
from higher education funding.

Snyder then began a series of 

incremental increases to higher 
education for each subsequent 
year — a 3.1-percent raise in 2012, a 
2.2-percent raise in 2013, a 6.1-per-
cent raise in 2014 and a 2-percent 
raise in 2015 — though the final 
dollar amount still remains lower 
than it was when he took office.

However, much before Snyder, 

under Republican and Democratic 
governors alike, higher education 
has seen both heavy fluctuations 
and a pattern of cuts.

In interviews, state higher edu-

cation officials and legislators 
said past few years’ increases, are 
promising, but a long-term prob-
lem still remains.

State economics

Significant cuts to higher edu-

cation started in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s due to a recession in 
Michigan, according to Stephen 
DesJardins, professor of educa-
tion and public policy. DesJardins 
wrote “Michigan Public Higher 
Education: Recent Trends and Pol-
icy Considerations for the Coming 
Decade,” published in 2006.

Under 
former 
Gov. 
James 

Blanchard (D), public universities 
saw an increase in state appropria-
tions in the mid-1980s. According 
to DesJardins, Blanchard believed 
that a postsecondary education 
would stimulate both economic 
growth and development.

After Blanchard finished his 

term as governor, former Gov. 
John Engler (R) assumed office in 
1991, and the state started to strug-
gle with funding higher education, 
though DesJardins noted that 
Engler still managed to increase 
student financial aid.

At the conclusion of Engler’s 

years as governor, former Gov. 
Jennifer Granholm (D) was elect-
ed in 2003. Granholm cut higher 
education funding to balance the 
state budget, continuing a down-

Michigan voters to 
consider 1 percent 
sales tax increase 

on May ballot

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

In January, Gov. Rick Snyder 

(R) approved a plan to fund road 
repairs and other infrastruc-
ture upgrades in the state. But 
because the proposal must also 
receive approval from Michi-
gan voters, both proponents 
and critics are already prepared 
to sway voters before the May 
election.

Snyder’s plan, Proposal 1, has 

received mixed reviews from the 
state’s residents and businesses. 
Supporters say they are con-
cerned with the poor condition 
of Michigan’s roads. However, 
others worry that increasing 
the state sales tax caters to spe-
cial interests groups and will 
have a disproportionate effect 
on lower-income residents.

Under the plan, a whole-

sale tax on motor fuels would 
replace the state sales tax on 
fuel, which currently provides 
funding for K-12 schools and 
local municipal governments.

Revenue from that wholesale 

tax would be earmarked entire-
ly for funding transportation 
and related infrastructure.

Snyder’s 
proposal 
also 

includes a 1-percent increase in 
the state sales tax, from 6 to 7 
percent, to replace the funding 
for schools, municipalities and 
other entities that would be lost 
with the elimination of the sales 
tax on fuel.

Though 
the 
legislature 

passed the proposal in Decem-
ber, a sales tax change requires 
an amendment to the state con-
stitution. Michigan constitu-
ents will vote on the proposal 
May 5.

If passed, the legislature 

anticipates the restructuring 
will raise about $2 billion per 
year, according to an analysis by 
the Senate Fiscal Agency.

Safe Roads Yes, the ballot 

committee in favor of Snyder’s 
proposal, has focused on the 
message that fixing the roads 
is an urgent matter of public 
safety.

“Any of us who drive Michi-

gan roads and bridges under-
stand just how dangerous it’s 
become,” said Roger Martin, a 
spokesperson for the commit-
tee. “It’s dangerous for fire-
fighters and ambulance drivers 
and dangerous for police offi-
cers and sheriffs.”

First-time voters 
currently required 
to vote in person 

for elections

ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

A bill proposed in the Michi-

gan state legislature could make 
voting easier for University stu-
dents.

Earlier this month, several 

state senators sponsored a bill 
that would allow first-time vot-
ers in the state of Michigan to 
vote by absentee ballot or mail. 
The bill has been sent to the Sen-
ate’s Committee on Elections and 
Government Reform for review.

Currently, first-time voters in 

Michigan are required to vote 
in person unless disabled, older 
than 60 or temporarily residing 
overseas.

Proponents of the new legisla-

tion said the current law presents 

a problem for many University 
students, who are living in Ann 
Arbor during their first election 
and cannot return to their home-
town to vote in person.

Steve Bieda (D–Warren), a 

co-sponsor, said he hopes to 
encourage voter turnout by mak-
ing voting more accessible. He 
said current legislation unfairly 
benefits the state’s Republicans 
because college students tend to 
be younger and more liberal, and 
are more likely to vote for Demo-
cratic candidates.

“Frankly, I think it’s a very 

partisan attempt to prevent peo-
ple from voting,” he said.

Bieda added that he is unsure 

if the committee, which is made 
up of four Republicans and one 
Democrat, will schedule a hear-
ing for the bill. He said he pre-
dicts the bill will not receive a 
hearing.

“This is one example that 

we’re trying to overcome on a 
useless law that doesn’t serve any 
purpose other than make it more 

Initiative designed 
to promote human, 
planetary health

By LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Students searching for hot 

dogs in East Quad Residence 
Hall on Monday were headed 
for disappointment.

Monday 
marked 
Michi-

gan Dining’s first step toward 
joining 
“Meatless 
Monday” 

— a global movement started 
in 2003 at the John Hopkins 

Bloomberg School of Public 
Health. East Quad was the first 
to try it out — throughout the 
entire day, no meat was served 
at the dining hall.

The initiative has reached 

36 different countries and is 
rooted in the idea that decreas-
ing the amount of meat eaten 
is good for the health of both 
humans and the planet.

LSA sophomore Katherine 

Hamilton said she agrees that 
Meatless Monday is beneficial 
to health.

“A lot of meat isn’t real-

ly made ethically or totally 
healthily and so I think giving 
up meat for a day a week is just a 

good idea in general,” she said.

The Meatless Monday cam-

paign’s website says going 
meatless at least once a week 
can make diners less likely to 
develop 
chronic 
conditions 

such as cancer, cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes and obesity.

Buzz Cummings, head chef 

at East Quad, agrees that meat 
can increase these risks, and 
said he eats with health in 
mind.

“I’ve tried to eat more fruits 

and vegetables because I was 
diagnosed with cancer myself,” 
Cummings said. “You can real-
ly satisfy someone’s diet with 

Meeting is first of 
several to address 
2016, 2017 fiscal 

year budgets

By ANASTASSIOS

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

convened Monday night to dis-
cuss the first part of the city bud-
get for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.

The meeting was the first 

round of discussions on the bud-
get, and included comments from 
representatives of the courts, the 
fire department and the police 
department, as well as City 
Administrator Steve Powers.

Tom Crawford, the city’s chief 

financial officer, said the city’s 
general fund has not yet recov-
ered from the 2008 economic 
recession.

“The general fund is still 

recovering from the downturn 
in a number of different ways 
and it’s still going to take us more 
time do that,” he said.

Crawford noted that projec-

tions for the operating budget, 
which are based on both exist-
ing operations and staff requests, 
show there will be an adjusted 
net deficit of $1,815,978 in 2016 
and of $2,550,605 in 2017. The

AKHIL MUNAGALA

Sophomore pursues music dream

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Dentistry student Tabita Filimon makes paper 
cut-outs for a stop motion video in her sculpting 
class in the basement of East Quad on Monday.

CUT IT OUT

LSA sophomore Akhil Muna-

gala is a rising hip-hop musician 
from Northville, Mich. He has 
been rapping for five years and just 
released his first mixtape under the 
name Mocha. The five-track set is 
titled “95 til Infinity,” and the fea-
tured single “VIP” has more than 
6,000 listens in its first month 
online. Akhil is on a pre-medical 
academic path and plans to major 
in neuroscience.

Who are your musical inspi-

rations?

The reason I started rapping 

was because of Nas. I heard his 
song “One Mic” when I was in 
fourth grade. I remember think-
ing, “Wow this is crazy, he’s spit-
tin’ a lot of real talk.” His music 

really appealed to me. As a kid 
I was a pretty shy person, and 
I realized it helped for me to 
let everything out by writing it 
down. Eventually that translated 
into music.

You just released a mixtape. 

Could you tell me about that?

It’s called “95 til Infinity.” It’s 

a five-song set. It’s pretty much 
all of the songs I thought that I 
needed to put out right now. It’s 
my first mixtape, and I’m excited 
to finally be able to put my work 
into one cohesive project.

What is the best song you’ve 

released so far?

Based on overall production I’d 

say “VIP.” and the numbers show 

it — it’s definitely become much 
more popular than I expected 
it to. Especially since there was 
basically no marketing, I just put 
it up on social media. Me per-
sonally, though, I like my song 
“Til Infinity.” I feel like it’s more 
of a personal song, and the flow 
is cool. It’s more hip-hoppy and 
doesn’t sound mainstream.

Why have you chosen to 

study medicine?

I’ve always wanted to be a doc-

tor. I was really into science as a 
kid. What really made me want to 
follow this path, though, is having 
seen so many people, especially in 
Detroit, that are suffering and get 
very little medical attention.

Officals plan for 
rescue loans amid 
collapsing economy

ATHENS, 
Greece 
(AP) 

— Caught between its own 
defiant 
campaign 
pledges 

and 
pressure 
from 
credi-

tors, Greece’s left-wing gov-
ernment will deliver a list 
of reforms Tuesday to debt 
inspectors for final approval 
of extended rescue loans, offi-

cials said.

Prime Minister Alexis Tsip-

ras was already facing dissent 
within his left-wing Syriza 
party over claims it is back-
tracking on its recent elec-
tion-winning promises to ease 
budget cuts for the recession-
battered Greeks.

Two officials linked to the 

government said the list will 
be sent to Brussels early Tues-
day and be reviewed at a tele-
conference of the 19 eurozone 
finance ministers later in the 

day.

They spoke on condition 

of anonymity either because 
he wasn’t authorized to make 
comments or because of the 
sensitivity of the negotiations.

Greece and bailout credi-

tors have been in a standoff 
since Prime Minister Alex-
is Tsipras’ left-wing Syriza 
party won general elections 
last month on a pledge to tear 
up bailout agreements and 
seek a massive write off of 
bailout debts, totaling 240 bil-
lion euros ($271 billion).

But they reached a tentative 

agreement Friday to extend 
the country’s rescue loan pro-
gram by four months, avoiding 
the risk of a Greek default and 
exit from the euro currency.

The 
government 
official 

said reforms would focus on 
curbing tax evasion, corrup-
tion, smuggling and exces-
sive bureaucracy while also 
addressing poverty caused by 
a six-year recession.

A Syriza official in Brussels 

said that “immediate priority” 
would be given to the settling 
of overdue debts, the protec-
tion of people with mortgage 
arrears as well as the ending 
of foreclosures of first resi-
dencies.

“Creditors will be skepti-

cal. These are notoriously 
difficult reforms and, in the 
case of the latter, usually cost 
money,” said Megan Greene, 
chief economist at Manulife 
Asset Management.

“It will be difficult for the 

Greek government to provide 
concrete measures for achiev-
ing these goals, and they will 
almost certainly be unable 
to achieve much before the 
next round of negotiations in 
June.”

Tsipras is also facing pres-

sure within his party.

Several prominent Syriza 

members have publicly said 
the party should honor its 
campaign promises.

Tamas Gombosi on 
his personal journey 

through the 
solar system

By SAMIHA MATIN

For the Daily

Engineering Prof. Tamas Gom-

bosi lectured on what he called 
his “personal journey through the 
solar system.”

Gambosi lectured in Rack-

ham Amphitheatre Monday upon 
receiving a named professorship 
in the Department of Engineering 
— the Konstantin I. Gringauz dis-
tinguished University Professor of 
Space Science.

Gambosi directs of the Center 

for Space Environment Model-
ing and founded the University’s 
doctorate program in space and 
planetary physics and the master’s 
program in space engineering.

Throughout his career, he 

made scientific contributions to 
the fields of planetary exploration 
and the physics of space and the 
planets.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
opened 
the 
lecture 

by congratulating Gombosi for 
his dedication to teaching and 
research.

“As a space physicist, Profes-

sor Gombosi has contributed sig-
nificantly to space and planetary 
physics and in revolutionizing 
space weather research,” Schlis-
sel said. “His accomplishments 
include developing the first time 
dependent model of terrestrial 
polar winds flowing from the ion-
osphere to the magnetosphere.”

The son of Hungarian Holo-

caust survivors, Gombosi credited 
his sense of persistence to his fam-
ily background.

Gombosi 
earned 
his 
mas-

ter’s and doctorate degrees from 
Loránd Eötvös University in 
Budapest in 1970, where he met 
space pioneer Konstantin Grin-
gauz. Gringauz later became his 
mentor as Gombosi completed his 
postdoctoral research at the Space 
Research Institute in Moscow.

While in Russia they studied 

the impacts of solar winds on the 
charged spheres of Venus.

“I was just a kid from Hun-

gary back then,” Gombosi said. “I 
stepped out of my comfort zone. 
Coming from Hungary, where this 
was no space program, to the Rus-
sian Space Research Institute, it 

felt like heaven.”

Considered an international 

diplomat in the world of science, 
he is also renowned for working 
with a diverse group of scientists 
from around the world.

In 1980, he worked for the Sovi-

et Union’s first major international 
planetary mission, the VEGA 
mission. Since joining the Univer-
sity faculty in 1987, Gombosi has 
worked on sending the Rosetta 
satellite to comet Churyumov-
Gerasimenko and developing soft-
ware to monitor space weather.

Still, Gombosi said he is most 

enthusiastic about teaching.

“We have learned everything 

from our mentors,” Gombosi said. 
“The scientific community can 
only reach milestones if we too 
mentor our future generation stu-
dents. We don’t carry out research 
for money though. You should 
only do it if you enjoy.”

Dogacan Ozturk, a Ph.D. candi-

date in Atmospheric, Oceanic and 
Space Sciences, said as an interna-
tional student, he found Gombosi’s 
speech inspiring.

“Attending this lecture really 

showed that your background 
didn’t matter if you have pas-
sion for it,” Ozturk said. “He’s a 
remarkable professor.”

all the different fruits and vegeta-
bles that are out there. The whole 
movement has gotten pretty large 
in the last 15 years or so.”

Michigan Dining also cited 

several sustainability reasons for 
taking this meatless step, includ-
ing to reduce the University’s car-
bon footprint. The United Nations 
estimates that around one-fifth of 
man-made, greenhouse gas emis-
sions come from the meat indus-
try.

A second reason is to reduce 

dining hall water usage.

“Close to 2000 gallons of water 

are needed to produce a single 
pound of beef, where it only takes 
40 gallons of water to produce a 
pound of vegetables,” Cummings 
said.

Cummings mentioned a third 

benefit of going meatless: reduc-
ing Michigan’s fuel dependence. 
In the United States, it takes 
around 40 calories of fossil fuel 
energy to produce one calorie of 
feedlot beef while it takes only 
around 2.2 calories of fossil fuel 
to produce an equivalent amount 
of plant-based protein.

In a press release, Michigan 

Dining said it elected East Quad 
as the pioneer for Meatless Mon-
day in dining hall for two reasons. 
First, a proportion of the student 
community eating at East Quad 
has backed sustainability efforts 
in the past. Second, East Quad 
is located close to the Mosher-
Jordan and South Quad dining 
halls, providing meat eaters with 
nearby options if a meatless meal 
is unappealing.

Though the day’s food options 

were entirely vegetarian, Cum-
mings and his staff strove to cre-
ate a menu that would appeal to 
all types of eaters.

For the “burger and fries peo-

ple,” for example, the kitchen 
staff concocted portobello slid-
ers, which contained marinated 
grilled portobello mushrooms 
on a slider bun with a baby kale 
mix.

“We try to make everything 

every day as fresh and appetiz-
ing as possible, but today we’re 
really going to try to turn it up 
so we can get nothing but posi-
tive comments,because we’d like 
to keep this going,” Cummings 
said.

Yet, for some students, like 

Kinesiology 
freshman 
Ryan 

Armbruster, the accommoda-
tions were not enough.

“I’m paying for this food and I 

don’t think it should be restrict-
ed to certain things. They have 
different stations in there — it 
works well the way it is,” he said. 
“They have the vegan station, 
the vegetarian station and things 
like that. It’s not like I’m com-
pletely condemning it. I’m still 
going to eat there today.”

East Quad’s number of student 

customers did go down today. 
At both breakfast and lunch the 
dining hall saw a decrease in 
about 150 students from a nor-
mal day’s dining numbers. Still, 
Cummings has hope.

“Will we do it again? I don’t 

know,” he said. “I don’t think it 
was a total bust.”

Alongside the negative feed-

back posters hanging on the wall 
outside East Quad’s dining hall 
— which included Armbruster’s 
comments — there were also 
positive feedback postings. Some 
comments included, “It’s better 
for human and environmental 
health,” and “actually v. tasty 
options!”

Cummings said the staff and 

administration will review the 
positive and negative feedback 
before deciding whether Meat-
less Monday will continue. If 
feedback is positive, he said he 
hopes this is an initiative they 
can repeat once a month, or 
maybe even once a week.

bulk of these deficits, he added, 
are caused by staff compensation.

Ann Arbor Police Chief John 

Seto discussed a proposed bud-
get expansion for the police 
department. According to the 
city’s budget impact analysis, the 
police department is requesting 
$290,667 in additional funds for 
2016 and an additional $132,867 
for fiscal year 2017.

The request includes money 

for replacements of police armor 
for 70 police officers, which will 
cost a total of $49,000. Tasers 
for 25 officers are also included 
in the budget projection.

Additionally, 
Seto 
noted 

that by June 30, 2017, 13 of the 
department’s 
25 
supervisors 

will be up for retirement and 
therefore promotions will need 
to be made. The staffing adjust-
ments are estimated to cost 
$35,000.

Larry Collins, chief of the 

Ann Arbor Fire Department, 
said the department is asking 
for $200,666 in additional mon-
ies for 2016 and $103,202 in 2017.

The additional money would 

cover two four-wheel drive 
emergency staff vehicles for 
assistant fire chiefs. Until now, 
stipends allowed assistant fire 
chiefs to use their own vehicles 
for transportation in cases of 
emergency.

An important point for both 

Seto and Collins was accrediting 
their departments by becoming 
members of professional organi-
zations.

Seto said the Ann Arbor 

Police Department was previ-
ously a member of the Commis-

sion for the Accreditation of Law 
Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) 
but left in 2003. He now wants 
the department to regain its 
membership, which is estimated 
to cost a one-time fee of $14,000.

“We will be held to standards 

that are nationally accepted,” 
Seto said. “Much like I speak 
about many times being on the 
same page on training policies 
with local departments, I feel 
it’s just as important to have 
our standards on training and 
policies on the national level as 
well. Receiving that accredita-
tion will give us that process 
and that system.”

He added that he would like 

to make one of the police offi-
cers or detectives a lieutenant to 
take on the process of achieving 
accreditation.

Expressing a similar senti-

ment, Collins said he wants the 
Ann Arbor Fire Department to 
become a member of the Center 
for Public Safety Excellence.

“It’s all about promoting 

excellence 
and 
encouraging 

quality services to the commu-
nity,” Collins said. “It lets us a 
show you in a host of different 
ways what our service package 
is and how we are achieving 
that service package for the dol-
lars that are invested.”

Collins noted he would like to 

hire a part-time intern for three 
years rather than relocating a 
fire department employee for 
the job of moving through the 
accreditation process. Accord-
ing to the budget, the intern 
would cost $72,000 for both fis-
cal years.

The next hearing on the bud-

get process is set for March 9. 
The Council will formally con-
sider the budget May 18.

ward path.

The main impact of this trend 

can be viewed in the balance 
between tuition and state appro-
priations in University budgets.

In the 1970s, the state used to 

pay approximately 75 percent of 
public universities’ operations, 
while the universities’ tuition 
and fees would pay for the rest, 
said Mark Burnham, Michigan 
State University’s vice president 
for governmental affairs.

However, Burnham said the 

trend has now reversed, and 
MSU’s funding from the state is 
now below 22 percent.

This situation is similar at the 

University, as 71.2 percent of the 
University’s budget came from 
tuition and fees for the 2015 fis-
cal year, according to the Uni-
versity’s Funding Snapshot. The 
state contributed 16.4 percent 
of the University’s budget this 
year. These state appropriations 
are a continuation of a down-
ward trend, as state appropria-
tions were around 59 percent 
in 1978, but fell to 32 percent in 
2002, according to DesJardins’s 
research.

“The amount of state support 

has eroded dramatically,” Burn-
ham said.

In an interview last month, 

Cynthia Wilbanks, the Univer-
sity’s vice president for govern-
ment relations, said the state’s 
economic conditions were chal-
lenging from 2002 to 2011, which 
was when Granholm held’s the 
governor’s office.

She said she would argue that 

at times, areas identified as a pri-
ority for gubernatorial admin-
istrations have to be abandoned 
based on factors such as poor 
economic conditions.

“I would make the case that 

each governor has to have their 
set of priorities and wants to 
hold themselves to those priori-
ties unless or until other factors 
that they simply can not control 
really force decisions that may 
not be their favorite thing to do,” 
Wilbanks said.

During 
Granholm’s 
early 

years as governor, about 26 per-
cent of the population in the 
age range 25 to 34 in Michigan 
received a bachelor’s degree or 
higher, which was below the 
national average of 28 percent 
for the same age range. How-
ever, DesJardins wrote this phe-
nomenon should not have been 
surprising because many high 
school graduates went to manu-
facturing jobs, which provided 
a high standard of living com-
pared to jobs in other states not 
requiring a college degree.

“The days of (manufacturing 

jobs) being a viable option are vir-
tually gone, as the auto industry 
continues to lose market share to 
foreign competition, with it the 
jobs that provided an avenue to 
the middle class for a generation 
(or more) of Michigan’s citizens,” 

DesJardins wrote.

Along with drawing high 

school 
students 
straight 
to 

the workforce, the automotive 
industry also affected higher 
education funding.

Because 
the 
“Big 
Three” 

automakers — Ford, General 
Motors and Chrysler — provided 
approximately 80 percent of the 
cars in the world market in 1950, 
the state of Michigan’s tax base 
was heavily dependent on the 
automotive industry, according 
to DesJardins.

As 
time 
progressed, 
the 

Detroit automobile industry’s 
share of the world market fell 
below 25 percent and Michigan’s 
tax revenue suffered. As a result, 
he wrote, higher education fund-
ing was targeted and cut.

Wilbanks 
said 
economic 

activity clearly affects higher 
education funding.

“As much as higher educa-

tion support comes from the 
state’s General Fund, and the 
General Fund is almost entirely 
from revenues that are based 
on economic activity, when the 
economic activity of the state is 
either declining or anemic, the 
opportunity to fund at a high 
level, some state priorities is 
really the $64,000 question,” 
she said.

Echoing the trends observed 

by DesJardins, in an interview 
earlier this month, state Rep. 
Adam Zemke (D–Ann Arbor) 
emphasized that higher educa-
tion cuts aren’t exclusive to the 
Snyder administration.

He said past legislators and 

governors are also to blame for 
the common trend of cutting 
higher education.

“The higher education fund-

ing problems, meaning the lack 
of adequate funding, is an issue 
that has transcended guberna-
torial administrations,” Zemke 
said.

Long-term planning

Most 
recently, 
over 
the 

decade from 2004 to 2014, the 
state’s support for higher edu-
cation decreased by 29 percent, 
according to the think tank the 
Center for Michigan.

John Austin, president of 

the State Board of Education, 
said this decrease amounts to 
approximately $800 million.

Along with this data, the 

National Association of State 
Student Grant and Aid Programs 
recently released an annual 
report which revealed Michigan 
as the worst state in the country 
in regards to the state spending 
money for financial aid over the 
decade from 2003 to 2013. In fis-
cal 2003, the state spent $218.185 
million on college scholarships. 
Fast forward 10 years and the 
state spent $92.674 million in 
the fiscal 2013, which represents 
a $125.511 million decrease.

Austin said he recognized the 

increases made to higher educa-
tion funding the past few years, 
but added that it will be hard to 
recover from the series of cuts.

“It’s beginning to get some 

attention, but it’s been severely 
damaged and has a long way 
to go before we’re arriving at 
enough aid to reverse some of 
the damage and support for 
institutions,” Austin said. “The 
damage has been done.”

Similar to Austin’s view-

point, Zemke said the increases 
to higher education are a posi-
tive sign, but clarified that these 
increases won’t make a big 
impact in the long run. Zemke 
is the vice chair of the House’s 
education committee.

“I’m glad that it’s an increase, 

but I think that we’re still going 
to run into the same problem 
that we’ve been running into,” 
Zemke said, referencing a lack of 
long-term planning.

Burnham 
said 
MSU 
cuts 

approximately $110 million per 
year on a recurring basis due 
to cuts. Burnham added that 
these cuts led to the termina-
tion of more than 40 academic 
programs at MSU, which had 
long-term impacts beyond an 
individual year.

“If we’re going to continue to 

be a competitive institution that 
provides a quality education 
that makes students who gradu-
ate here world class, competi-
tive anywhere in the world, then 
you have to have the faculty and 
facilities that are needed to do 
that,” Burnham said.

At the University, cuts were 

similar. In response to the 2011 
decrease in funding, several aca-
demic programs, including the 
Center for Ethics in Public Life, 
were closed. In recent years, the 
University has launched several 
cost-cutting initiatives such as 
strategic sourcing — purchasing 
supplies and equipment in bulk 
— and the Administrative Ser-
vices Transformation Project, 
which included an initiative to 
congregate some support staff in 
a shared service center.

The 
University 
has 
also 

increased 
its 
development 

efforts to compensate for small-
er state appropriations. The 
current campaign, Victors for 
Michigan, is aiming to raise 
$4 billion over the next several 
years.

Austin 
said 
the 
Snyder 

administration’s small increases 
aren’t innovative and did not 
require long-term planning for 
the future.

“There is no strategy,” he 

said. “It’s just some incremen-
tal change up or down of what 
we’ve already done.”

In an e-mail interview, Dave 

Murray, Snyder’s deputy press 
secretary, refuted the idea that 
Snyder doesn’t have a long-term 
plan for maintaining higher edu-
cation funding.

“Gov. Snyder’s goal is to 

increase the state’s investment 
in higher education, and to make 
sure a college education is with-
in reach for all Michiganders,” 
Murray wrote. “The governor’s 
goal is for 60 percent of residents 
to hold a high-quality degree or 
other credential by 2025.”

difficult for people to vote, to 
restrict people from voting,” 
Bieda said.

Republic committee mem-

bers 
David 
Robertson 
(R–

Grand Blanc), Patrick Colbeck 
(R–Canton), 
Judy 
Emmons 

(R–Sheridan) and Mike Shir-
key (R–Clarklake) could not be 
reached for comment.

Jesse Buchsbaum, chair of 

Voice Your Vote, a nonpartisan 
Central Student Government 
initiative aimed at engaging 
students in politics, said ease 
in voting is particularly impor-
tant for student voters.

“Because students have so 

much going on in their lives 
all the time, students are most 
likely to vote if the process is 
very, very easy for them,” he 
said.

To curb the potential aver-

sion students may feel toward 
toward both registering and 
going out to vote, Voice Your 
Vote aims to help students 
along and make the process as 
easy as possible. Along with 

educating students on both 
issues and candidates during 
election years, Voice Your Vote 
also encourages students to 
register by going door-to-door 
in residence halls and holding 
booths in the Diag.

Despite the group’s efforts 

to register and educate vot-
ers, Buchsbaum said efforts 
are still somewhat hindered by 
current law.

He said the bill’s passage 

would have mixed results for 
students on campus because it 
would only help students reg-
istered to vote in Michigan. 
Though the legislation would 
allow Michigan residents to 
vote for the first time while 
remaining in Ann Arbor, the 
bill would have no effect on 
out-of-state students, as their 
home state legislature may not 
allow first-time absentee vot-
ing.

“Most states don’t have laws 

where first time voters can 
vote absentee; you have to vote 
in person,” Buchsbaum said. 
“So, because many students at 
Michigan are still from out-
of-state, it may cause a decent 
amount of confusion.”

Martin also said Michigan 

currently spends less per capita 
on infrastructure than most 
other states.

The 
Coalition 
Against 

Higher 
Taxes 
and 
Special 

Interest Deals, one of several 
committees formed in opposi-
tion to Snyder’s plan, agrees 
that Michigan roads are in a 
state of disrepair. However, 
Randall Thompson, a spokes-
person for the group, said the 
committee does not believe 
Snyder’s current proposal is the 
right remedy.

Thompson said the group 

opposes Proposal 1. He said $1.2 
billion of the $2 billion raised by 
the proposal would go toward 
road funding, with the remain-
ing 40 percent funneled toward 
other projects.

He said the Snyder admin-

istration claimed it would use 
that remaining 40 percent for 
an income tax credit as well as 
to fund education, public trans-
portation and municipalities.

However, Thompson said the 

Snyder administration had to 
give out “sweetheart deals” to 
these interests so that the pro-
posal would have enough sup-
port to pass in May.

“(The administration’s) sup-

port of Proposal 2015-1 requires 
$700 million of other invest-
ments to special interests in 
order for us to fix our roads,” 
Thompson said. “We believe 

that Michigan roads are a prob-
lem — but we shouldn’t have to 
pay out $700 million to special 
interests to have the opportu-
nity to fix the roads.”

Martin said the $700 mil-

lion figure is mostly a realloca-
tion of funds that these groups 
already received from the sales 
tax on fuel, but will now come 
from the state sales tax revenue.

Martin said the proposal 

increases the state govern-
ment’s accountability and cre-
ates a fairer taxation structure 
for taxpayers.

“Right now, the 6-percent 

state sales tax on gasoline 
doesn’t go to fix roads and 
bridges,” Martin said. “The pol-
iticians in Lansing can basically 
spend that money wherever 
they want, and that’s wrong. We 
shouldn’t be paying taxes on gas 
that aren’t used to fix the roads 
and bridges.”

Martin said Proposal 1 would 

guarantee all tax revenue on 
the proposed new (wholesale) 
fuel tax would go to road fund-
ing.

The groups also disagree on 

the potential effects of a hike in 
the sales tax for consumers.

Thompson 
said 
such 
an 

increase would make it more 
difficult for many Michigan 
taxpayers to afford their taxes. 
He said the tax increase would 
strongly 
affect 
low-income 

taxpayers because it would 
take a larger chunk out of their 
monthly budgets than it would 
for higher income residents. 
These types of taxes are often 

termed regressive taxes.

Opposition groups have said 

the proposal could have a net 
impact of costing taxpayers $2 
billion per year.

“A guy making a million dol-

lars a year — is he really going 
to miss 1-percent sales tax? No, 
because he can already meet 
his basic needs,” Thompson 
said. “But to a single mom or a 
college student, 1-percent sales 
tax? That’s an additional 16.7 
percent (in tax) on every single 
thing you purchase.”

Martin argued it would be 

very difficult to calculate the 
cost to taxpayers of this pro-
posal. 
Whether 
a 
taxpayer 

would see a net gain or a net 
loss if Proposal 1 were enacted 
would depend on how much 
they drive, how much fuel they 
buy and how much they spend 
on sales-taxable items, he said.

“The working poor definite-

ly get a tax cut here,” Martin 
added. “There’s a tax cut in this 
for the working poor: an income 
tax credit that was abolished 
years ago is restored under this 
proposal.”

Donald 
Grimes, 
senior 

research associate at the Uni-
versity’s Institute for Research 
on Labor, Employment and 
the Economy, said in an e-mail 
interview Michigan residents 
would see benefits from the 
proposal.

“The residents will have a 

better driving experience and 
less money spent on vehicle 
repairs,” he said.

Grimes also said the proposal 

will create jobs in the state due 
to increased construction. He 
said improving the state’s roads 
would reduce the cost of trans-
portation and consequently the 
cost of doing business in Michi-
gan, encouraging job creation.

“The taxpayers will be get-

ting something for their money 
when the money is spent on 
roads even if they are not one 
of the people who will ben-
efit from the additional jobs,” 
Grimes said.

The University’s Center for 

Local, State, and Urban Policy 
released a report Monday sur-
veying Michigan local leaders’ 
views on road conditions and 
road funding in the state.

As part of the Michigan Pub-

lic Policy Survey, CLOSUP sur-
veyed 1,356 local government 
leaders and found that while 
road conditions vary across 
Michigan, there is widespread 
agreement among those lead-
ers that it would take a major 
increase in state funding to 
simply maintain current road 
conditions. Survey respondents 
largely said improving roads 
would require an overhaul of 
state funding.

CLOSUP found that 71 per-

cent of local officials say they 
are mostly or only able to focus 
on short-term fixes, like filling 
potholes, as opposed to practic-
ing long-term management.

“Overall, 65 percent of local 

leaders say they would have 
significant problems improv-
ing roads and bridges within 
their jurisdictions if the state 

does not significantly increase 
road funding,” a release on the 
survey said. “In fact, a major-
ity (53 percent) say it would be 
a significant problem just to 
maintain their roads if the state 
does not significantly increase 
funding.”

Safe Roads Yes and the Coali-

tion Against Higher Taxes and 
Special Interest Deals have 
received support from a variety 
of demographics and from both 
Democrats and Republicans.

Safe Roads Yes has a diverse 

membership, including school 
districts, police officers, county 
sheriff departments, business 
organizations and local units of 
government, Martin said.

As of Feb. 10, the commit-

tee had reported contributions 
of $3.2 million in a campaign 
finance statement, including 
support from the Michigan 
Infrastructure and Transporta-
tion Association, as well as sev-
eral other infrastructure and 
transportation-related groups.

In contrast, The Coalition 

Against Higher Taxes and Spe-
cial Interest Groups said they 
rely 
on 
small-denomination 

checks from residents across 
the state.

Both Martin and Thompson 

said their groups aim to turn 
out voters to the polls.

“We’ve got to have average 

citizens, got to have college stu-
dents, families and so on that 
get on board and make sure 
that their friends, loved ones, 
coworkers and fellow students 
vote,” Thompson said.

W

ith the number of reported sexual assaults rising on college 
campuses, gun lobbyists have started suggesting that the 
legalization of carrying concealed weapons on college 

campuses would make female students safer. This year, lawmakers 
in 10 states pushed bills through their legislatures that would allow 
concealed carry on their state’s college campuses. While advocates for 
this reform argue it is for the benefit of sexual assault survivors, there 
seems to be political motivation behind their reasoning. It appears 
that the pro-gun lobby is now utilizing the issue of sexual assault to 
validate concealed carry. However, this view overlooks the real issues 
surrounding sexual assault on college campuses and should absolutely 
not be implemented.

Last month, Florida State Rep. Dennis K. 

Baxley (R–Ocala) stated, “If you’ve got a person 
that’s raped because you wouldn’t let them 
carry a firearm to defend themselves, I think 
you’re responsible.” This is a strong statement, 
as it suggests that the use of violence is more 
a “responsibility” of the victim than an issue 
of the offender. This solution, advocated by 
Baxley, also forces women to be responsible in 
stopping sexual assault, as opposed to society 
as a whole.

The Florida bill went on to pass out of sub-

committee and is currently on the floor of the 
state House of Representatives. In Nevada, 
Assemblywoman Michele Fiore (R), who is 
sponsoring a similar bill in the Nevada House of 
Representatives, added to Baxley’s tone, stating 
in an interview with The New York Times, “If 
these young, hot little girls on campus have 
a firearm, I wonder how many men will want 
to assault them.” Making the assumption that 
these “young, hot little girls” should have to 
assume the jobs of the law enforcement officials 
is not addressing the rise of sexual assault. It 
also isn’t going to decrease the risk of violence 
on college campuses.

Additionally, this assumption that the 

current problem with sexual assault on college 
campuses is merely happenstance of a sexually 
charged individual on the streets attacking 
a woman is false. What is true, according to 
a study published by the U.S. Department of 
Justice in 2007, is that 19 percent of women 
in college were survivors of sexual assault or 
an attempted sexual assault at some point in 
their college career. Furthermore, about 85 to 
90 percent of these assaults occur by someone 
known to the victim.

John Foubert, president of One in Four, an 

educational service on college sexual assault 
and professor at Oklahoma State University, 
offered a different voice to the debate. Foubert, 
a professor in a state with a college concealed 
carry bill currently under review, contends 

that guns can’t solve the problem: “If you have 
a rape situation, usually it starts with some 
sort of consensual behavior, and by the time it 
switches to nonconsensual, it would be nearly 
impossible to run for a gun.”

This is not a far-fetched theory, considering 

that the rate at which survivors of sexual 
assault or attempted sexual assault knew their 
assailant. The DOJ study found that, when 
described by the survivors, the assailant was 
most commonly a classmate, friend, boyfriend, 
ex-boyfriend or acquaintance. These incidents 
are reported to have occurred mainly in two 
locations: 60 percent of the time in one of the 
two party’s private domains and 10 percent of 
the time in a fraternity house. It would be rather 
difficult, as a person in danger, to know exactly 
when and how to properly defend oneself in 
such situations.

There is a complete lack of practical 

applicability with these bills, especially in 
Michigan. Considering the age to legally carry 
a concealed weapon is 21 in the state, and most 
of these “hot, young” and “drug and alcohol 
abusing” college students that these advocates 
of the bill are describing are between the ages 
of 18 and 21, it would be illegal under state law 
for these individuals to purchase handguns 
from licensed dealers.

These bills being pushed appear to be either 

flawed attempts to fix the problem of sexual 
assault on college campuses or a rather thinly 
veiled facade for what these lobbyists are really 
promoting: legalizing weapon carrying. The 
issue of sexual assault on college campuses is 
one that is both sensitive in nature and hotly 
debated in society. For legislation to be debated 
and passed that puts the onus on the women 
who attend these institutions glosses over the 
real issues that exist in society. Everything 
should be done to drastically reduce the rate 
of sexual assault on college campuses in the 
United States, but concealed carry on campus is 
not the answer we so desperately need.

F

or the last two years, there 
has been something greatly 
bothering me about my col-

lege education. As 
excited as I am to 
feel the pride in 
holding a college 
degree in my hands, 
I have to admit 
some apprehension 
over a few words 
that will appear on 
my diploma: Gerald 
R. Ford School of 
Public Policy.

On September 8, 

1974, President Ger-
ald Ford granted a full pardon to former 
President Richard Nixon, one of the 
most pernicious criminals in recent his-
tory. Ford was widely castigated across 
the country for his decision, with ques-
tions arising about Ford’s motivations, 
his competence and the legitimacy of 
the Oval Office. Ford made a tough call, 
and whether his choice was right or 
wrong is highly questionable.

Were one to study public policy 

at Michigan, it sure wouldn’t seem 
that way.

Today, the Ford School serves as 

a permanent memorial to a largely 
misunderstood period of history. The 
school’s halls are adorned with pho-
tos of Ford’s life, a large portrait of the 
former president and commemorative 
posters of the school’s renaming and 
groundbreaking. According to Paul 
Courant, public policy professor and 
former director of the Ford School’s 
predecessor, the Institute of Public Pol-
icy Studies, there was little resistance 
to permanently memorializing Ford 
despite his rocky decision-making.

“Almost everybody, by the time we 

named the school, had come around to 
the view that actually pardoning Nixon 
was the right thing to have done,” Prof. 
Courant told me. “I didn’t detect any 
unhappiness about it within the faculty 
or students.”

Books about Ford paint him as a 

genuinely decent man committed to 
public service, while his own writing 
bleeds with a humility that’s hard not 
to admire. He would have been the first 
to admit that he was not perfect, nor 
was his decision-making. But herein 

lies the problem with the Ford School: 
memorials aren’t there to spark debate 
or respect nuance. As Adam Gopnik 
writes in The New Yorker, “The memo-
rials’ end is to sacralize their subject in 
a way that shames anyone who contests 
its centrality — to build in a way that 
makes contention come at an extreme-
ly high price in social discomfort and 
 

disapproval.”

For Gerald Ford, the unquestioned 

orthodoxy is simple. As Susan Collins, 
Dean of the Public Policy School, told 
me, “There is increasingly a view in ret-
rospect that he did the right thing even 
among people who strongly disagreed 
with him … the idea (was) that in order 
to heal the country, it was more impor-
tant to move forward and focus on other 
topics instead of focusing on the trav-
esty of what Richard Nixon had done.”

There is little doubt that Ford 

made the pardon with good inten-
tions, but it being the “right thing 
to do” is far from settled. Looking 
at the way executive immunity has 
grown since Watergate, it becomes 
increasingly difficult to view Ford’s 
decision positively. As Glenn Green-
wald argues in his book “With Lib-
erty and Justice for Some,” the same 
reasoning behind the Nixon pardon 
has excused endless high-level law 
breaking from Reagan to Clinton to 
Bush to Obama.

Ford created a precedent where the 

prosecution of executive officials would 
“tear the country apart.” This argument 
that America needs to “look forward 
and not backward” and avoid “reopen-
ing old wounds” is exactly why Bush-
era officials have never been prosecuted 
for torture and warrantless spying.

In both situations, the assumption is 

that the American people are too sensi-
tive or too vindictive to see presidents 
treated like any other criminal. I don’t 
know what these platitudes about the 
country being “torn apart” are sup-
posed to mean, but if America can sur-
vive a civil war and the assassination of 
presidents, it can survive Richard Nixon 
and Dick Cheney facing trial. Ford let 
Nixon go with the stroke of his pen, but 
his legacy is the reason Cheney and oth-
ers will never face justice. In 1974, when 
asked about writing an executive code 
of ethics, Ford responded, “The code of 

ethics that will be followed will be the 
example that I set.”

To be fair, Gerald Ford is not the only 

questionable person memorialized at 
Michigan. Sam Zell filled the Chicago 
Tribune’s leadership with philander-
ing drunks who drove the company 
to bankruptcy, while Alfred Taubman 
is a convicted felon. Weill Hall, the 
Ford School’s home, as well as the 
Joan and Sanford Weill Deanship, are 
both named in honor of an investment 
banker dubbed “The Shatterer of Glass-
Steagall.” This phenomenon is not lim-
ited to Michigan; plenty of campuses 
are dotted with schools, buildings and 
programs named for powerful people 
with shady pasts.

To their credit, both Collins and 

Courant welcomed critical inquiry into 
Ford’s legacy. Dean Collins expressed 
her desire to hold events debating the 
Ford presidency, especially the pardon 
of Nixon, and wished I had voiced my 
concerns sooner. While I appreciate the 
open-mindedness, an occasional panel 
discussion will be long outlasted and 
overshadowed by the sheer size and per-
manence of the Ford School itself.

The public policy school is not about 

to change its name, nor are any of these 
other institutions in question. But 
shouldn’t there be more debate on who 
deserves to have their name adorn our 
University? Shouldn’t policy schools 
scrutinize presidents, not deify them?

Shouldn’t we be worried about dis-

torting history?

The day that Ford was to pardon 

Nixon, Jerald terHorst, Ford’s press sec-
retary and longtime friend, handed in his 
letter of resignation. Writing to the presi-
dent, terHorst said:

“I cannot in good conscience support 

your decision to pardon former Presi-
dent Nixon … Try as I can, it is impossible 
to conclude that the former President is 
more deserving of mercy than persons 
of lesser station in life whose offenses 
have had far less effect on our national 
 

wellbeing.”

It wouldn’t be much, but along with 

the statue and photos of Ford, maybe 
terHorst’s letter deserves a place in my 
school, too.

The negative that prevails

T

he First Amendment has 
offered us many liberties to 
express our voices without 

hindrance. 
How-

ever, with such a 
broad 
freedom, 

we cannot expect 
that everyone will 
always 
use 
this 

privilege 
in 
the 

wisest way. There 
are instances each 
day when we may 
— 
purposely 
or 

unintentionally 
— abuse our free 
speech rights for ill 
over advantage.

Our words are precise, and they 

have power to inflict pain. Howev-
er, this isn’t something wrong with 
the amendment or wrong with free 
presses that do not censor voices. 
Rather, the culprit lies in the indi-
viduals who present the harmful or 
offensive perspectives.

Especially with the onset of the 

digital age, the reader experience 
has extended to deeper dimen-
sions. Though we’re separated by 
individual screens, the Internet has 
created an expansive community 
of consumers. Before online com-
menting culture, article authors 
and media creators remained elu-
sive and aloof from us as consumers. 
Now, we’re able to interact directly 
with content producers and share 
our thoughts with fellow viewers 
— and more than ever before, we 
have a larger, diversified platform 
to megaphone our pedestrian ideas. 
Our voices are louder and more free 
than ever.

As a result, “new media” has 

emerged, where we can respond 
to articles and share our thoughts 
through personal channels, like 
blogs or “vlogs” (video-logs). The 
boundaries between content cre-
ator and consumer have blurred — 
anyone, regardless of education or 
other demographics, can add input. 
The inclusion of more voices may 
illuminate some especially impor-
tant insight from common citizens, 
but it also comes with the potential 
for creators to offend parties and 
receive harsh opposition. In fact, 

when our bodies are physically hid-
den behind a screen and our identi-
ties can be obscured by an online 
pseudonym, we may feel more auda-
cious and sound more brash than we 
would in real life.

This all being said, as both con-

tent creator and consumer now, we 
have developed a natural tendency 
to focus on the negative. In the vast 
body of opinions on the World Wide 
Web, in the wealth of knowledge 
on the online abyss — we somehow 
manage to selectively identify the 
offensive and the harmful — and 
focus our energies there.

On the one hand, from the con-

tent creator lens — personally, as 
both a student journalist and artist 
— upon initial reaction, one nega-
tive comment on my work overshad-
ows the array of other comments I 
may receive.

On the other hand, as a member 

of the Internet consumer commu-
nity, when I scroll through social 
media feeds or skim newspaper 
front pages, I subconsciously click 
on headlines of devastation or 
revulsion first. I’m subconsciously 
drawn to stories of turmoil and 
corruption, or opinions that strike 
a chord of alarm or even disgust. 
Articles are stories: to us as readers, 
they are nothing important or inter-
esting if not defined by conflict. We 
grow too quickly bored by a lack of 
disruption in the news.

The media represents our best 

understanding of the norm — and 
because the news more often than 
not reports the negative, our under-
standing of “normal” has skewed 
toward pejorative. In the most 
prominent examples: from an out-
of-state perspective, Detroit is often 
portrayed in terms of crime and 
economic deterioration; to western-
ers uninformed on the Middle East, 
the area as a whole is generalized 
with strife and turmoil; the preva-
lence of female victimization sto-
ries have elevated male perpetrator 
statistics to feel higher than they 
 

actually are.

In these instances, when a mar-

ginal representation of the whole 
picture dominates our understand-
ings, we fail to see the nuanced 

dimensions behind each subject. 
We fail to see the improving parts 
of Detroit vibrant with history and 
culture; we may categorize one 
race or religion hatefully based on 
atrocities committed by a fraction 
of them; we may oversimplify a gen-
der based on exaggerated fears of 
all men. When we are immersed in 
news of global warfare and national 
corruption — with news of mun-
dane communal peace or human 
righteousness rarely mentioned on 
national scales — we become accus-
tomed to remembering and paying 
attention to the negative most.

In some inexplicably wicked 

way, we are excited by the negative 
(widespread danger, the ignorance 
or deviance of others) gives us emo-
tional stimulation to incite discus-
sion and collective effect. However, 
we have to remember that they’re 
not representative of the whole. 
Personally, as a writer, it’s impor-
tant to remember that one piece of 
negativity isn’t representative of all 
the consumers of my content.

We need to stop allowing the 

negative to prevail, or else we will 
only impart this affinity for negativ-
ity onto others, ingraining it deeper 
into our peers and our future gen-
erations just as it has been instilled 
in us. We’re a new media culture 
with a vast interactive community. 
It has become our duty to do more 
than consume idly now that we have 
the ability to both create and com-
ment. We’ve been granted immense 
liberties to speak as freely as we 
wish. So in return, we must use 
our free speech privileges to share 
articles of positivity and poignancy 
just as much as articles we comment 
 

hate upon.

To form a complete and balanced 

view of any subject, the negative 
information presented must be cou-
pled with the good. We must read 
enlightening responses along with 
the articles we spite. Along with 
disagreement we input on articles 
we dislike, we must also respond 
with positive comments on opinions 
we find insightful.

BEN KELLER | VIEWPOINT
Keeping church and state separate

For as long as there have been inhabitants of 

the American continent, multiple sets of religious 
and moral codes have determined how its popu-
lations lived. Whether it be the nature-based 
religions of Native Americans or the “newer” 
faith of Christianity brought by European set-
tlers, institutions of distinct beliefs have guided 
the vast majority of ethnic and social groups that 
have existed on this land. There’s little doubt that 
religion has had a heavy influence on our society, 
and its role in the formation of the United States 
is strikingly clear in our founding documents. 
However, there’s considerable debate regarding 
religion’s role in our government, and how law-
makers have, and continue to, inject their faiths 
into policy matters.

A recent piece in The New York Times by 

columnist Frank Bruni highlights attempts by 
politicians, particularly conservatives, to justify 
their agendas with reference to personal faith. 
These instances aren’t reserved for those on 
the right wing, either. As Bruni points out, 
during the 2008 presidential campaign, then-
Senator Barack Obama pointed to his faith for 
the reason he did not support the legality of 
 

same-sex marriages.

The fact is, since even the days before the 

American Revolution until the present, govern-
ment officials have defended actions and pro-
posed new laws based off of the religious code 
that they adhere to. This isn’t the correct path to 
sound administration. Rather, this form of gov-
erning results in baseless legislation lacking any 
real-world evidence and misconstrues the very 
nature of our founding.

I want to state that I am a religious man, 

myself. I do not harbor any ill will toward any 
set of faiths nor those who openly practice 
their beliefs. However, as a citizen, I do not 
subscribe to blurring the boundaries of religion 
 

and government.

Were our founders religious? Yes. Did they take 

certain values of their religion — equality, justice, 
freedom — and incorporate them into our gov-
ernment? Yes. Did they envision a nation where 
the government enacted laws with the guidance 
and approval of a higher being? Unequivocally no. 
James Madison, a key contributor to some of the 
most important decisions establishing the United 
States as a nation, was once quoted saying, “the 
civil government functions with complete suc-
cess by the total separation of the Church from 
 

the State.”

It should come as no surprise that the First 

Amendment accentuates this fact: the state can-
not establish a religion, but it cannot impede the 
free exercise of one, either. In his piece, Bruni 
quotes former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 
as saying America had abandoned its identity as 
a “God-centered nation that understands that 
our laws do not come from man, they come from 
God.” While Mr. Huckabee may truly believe 
that, he seems to be forgetting that even our 
founders did not believe in divinely inspired leg-
islation. Moreover, it is important to note that not 
all of our current lawmakers believe in Christi-
anity like Mr. Huckabee, let alone God.

When we legislate based on morality, issues 

get distorted to focusing on aspects of life that 
one can debate ad nauseam. For instance, if I 
propose a law to you and base it off of a religious 
teaching in which you don’t believe, then there 

is no room for debate or compromise. 
There is no historical precedent to 
cite, no facts or figures to corrobo-
rate that type of theory. Religious 
beliefs can’t be proven with secular 
evidence — that is the point of faith. 
However, this type of argument is 
continually used for issues ranging 
from marijuana legalization to gay 

marriage to abortion.

I believe in God. I do not believe 

in a government derived from God. 
Seldom is there a place for religion in 
politics, and to try and use religion 
to advocate for particular measures 
politicizes a part of life that should 
remain above the jungle that is the 
current state of American politics. As 

Mr. Bruni states so accurately, “Politi-
cians’ religions … should be a source of 
their strength and of their empathy, 
not of their agendas.” I love practicing 
my faith, and I love participating in 
my government. Let’s keep those two 
actions separate.

Morris Bounds Sr. pauses while talking Monday, Feb. 23, 2015, in Ansted, W.Va., about a train derailment that destroyed his 
home near Mount Carbon, W.Va. Bounds said he is thankful to be alive after fleeing his home seconds before it was destroyed.

sparks controversy 
similar to Ferguson 

PASCO, Wash. (AP) — The 

high-profile attorney who repre-
sented the family of a black teen-
ager killed by a police officer in 
Ferguson, Missouri, says he’ll rep-
resent the parents of an unarmed 
Mexican man who was shot to 
death by officers this month in 
Washington state.

The Feb. 10 killing of Antonio 

Zambrano-Montes — captured on 
video by a witness — has sparked 
protests and calls for a federal 
investigation.

On Monday, Benjamin Crump 

told The Associated Press that the 
family is worried about the fair-
ness of an investigation.

Authorities 
say 
Zambrano-

Montes, a 35-year-old Mexican 
immigrant and former orchard 
worker, was throwing rocks at 
officers. They say a stun gun 
failed to subdue him.

“At the heart of the matter is 

what’s going on with what we see 
on that video — is it appropriate 
or not?” said the Florida-based 
Crump, who has represented the 
families of Trayvon Martin and 
Michael Brown.

Zambrano-Montes’ family is 

worried about whether the case 
will be investigated fairly because 
of “what happened in Ferguson,” 
Crump said.

“The No. 1 thing they said is, 

‘We don’t want them to say that 
the police acted appropriately,’” 
he told the AP.

In a video recording by Dario 

Infante, 21, of Pasco, five “pops” 
are audible, and Zambrano-Mon-
tes can be seen running away, 

pursued by three officers. As the 
officers draw closer, he stops, 
turns around and faces them. 
Multiple “pops” are heard, and 
the man falls to the ground.

The Franklin County coroner 

has ordered an inquest into the 
death, which is being reviewed 
by a regional task force and being 
monitored by federal authorities.

Felix Vargas, head of the Pasco 

Hispanic rights group Consejo 
Latino, said a Seattle-based Jus-
tice Department official met with 
his group Sunday. The official 
said meetings are planned this 
week with local authorities, Var-
gas said.

Pasco is a fast-growing agri-

cultural city of 68,000, where 
more than half the residents are 
Hispanic but few are members 
of the police force or the power 
structure

The killing was the fourth by 

Pasco police in less than a year 
and has led to protests. Officers 
were exonerated after similar 
investigations in the first three 
cases. Critics in the latest case say 
the officers should have used less 
than lethal force to subdue Zam-
brano-Montes.

Police said officers felt threat-

ened by Zambrano-Montes. He 
was arrested last year for assault 
after throwing objects at Pasco 
officers and trying to grab an offi-
cer’s pistol, court records show.

Authorities have said Zambra-

no-Montes was not armed with a 
gun or knife when he was killed. 
Whether he had a rock in his hand 
when he was shot is still under 
investigation.

Two of the officers involved 

were white, and the other His-
panic. All three opened fire, 
though the number of shots has 
not been disclosed.

dangerous encounter 

ANSTED, W.Va. (AP) — Mor-

ris Bounds Sr. wanted to make 
sure his home was tidy when 
his wife was let out of the hos-
pital, so he cleaned the kitchen 
and vacuumed their bedroom.

While doing the mindless 

chores, he noticed his cell-
phone on the bed and thought 
to himself: “I might need this.” 
After all, friends and fam-
ily had been coming and going 
from the house since his wife’s 
heart surgery, and he expected 
her home any day.

Bounds grabbed his cell-

phone off the bed and walked 
into the kitchen. As soon as he 
did, he heard the harrowing 
squeal of colliding metal and 
looked outside into the snow-
storm. Just 50 feet away, he 
could see a train crashing.

He bolted out the front door 

as fast as his bad knees could 
take him. He didn’t have time 
to grab his shoes and trudged 
through the snow in his socks. 

Temperatures were in the teens.

Turns out, having the cell-

phone helped save his life.

“I just had a second to look 

and a second to run,” Bounds 
told The Associated Press on 
Monday, exactly one week 
after 27 cars of a CSX train 
went off the tracks next to his 
home.

As he ran, the wreckage 

burst into spectacular fireballs 
that shot into the sky. The yard 
was on fire and “it blew that 
hot oil on both sides of me, all 
over the house, my trucks.”

“If I had been there anoth-

er second, it’d probably have 
killed me,” Bounds said. “Glass 
was flying everywhere behind 
me. The walls were caving in. I 
hadn’t run like that in years.”

Bounds is still having trou-

ble grasping what happened. 
His home of 25 years is ruined. 
His trucks were destroyed. 
Decades of photos and keep-
sakes are gone.

Bounds, 
a 
68-year-old 

retired 
machinist, 
suffered 

only inhalation injuries. No 
one else in the area was hurt.

But it could have been much 

worse.

His daughter, Sarah Ander-

son, and two grandchildren 
had been staying at the home 
while Bounds’ wife, Patty, was 
in the hospital.

Patty Bounds had convinced 

her daughter to go home to 
Ohio over the weekend to get a 
few things before coming back 
for another stay. Patty Bounds 
had had heart bypass surgery, 
came home and then went back 
to the hospital with the flu on 
the Friday before the crash. 
Had she been there, Bounds Sr. 
believes she never would have 
gotten out.

Bounds had also been wait-

ing on his son to come by and 
clear snow. The storm had just 
dumped more than 7 inches on 
his narrow strip of land sand-
wiched between the Kanawha 
River and railroad tracks in 
southern West Virginia.

His son, who lives 400 yards 

away, was on the way to his 
parents’ house when he had 
to turn around to get a snow 
shovel. When Morris Bounds 
Jr. got to his own house, he 
decided to rest rather than 
head back out into the snow-
storm. 

After 40 years, voter 
initiative passes with 
52 to 48 percent vote

 Alaska (AP) — Smoking, grow-
ing and possessing marijuana 
becomes legal in America’s 
wildest state Tuesday, thanks 
to a voter initiative aimed at 
clearing away 40 years of con-
flicting laws and court rulings.

Making Alaska the third 

state to legalize recreational 
marijuana was the goal of a 
coalition including libertar-
ians, rugged individualists and 
small-government Republicans 
who prize the privacy rights 
enshrined in the state’s consti-
tution.

But when they voted 52-48 

percent last November to legal-
ize marijuana use by adults in 
private places, they left many 
of the details to lawmakers and 
regulators to sort out.

Meanwhile, Alaska Native 

leaders worry that legalization 
will bring new temptations to 
communities already confront-
ing high rates of drug and alco-
hol abuse, domestic violence 
and suicide.

“When they start depending 

on smoking marijuana, I don’t 
know how far they’d go to get 
the funds they need to support 
it, to support themselves,” said 
Edward Nick, council member 
in Manokotak, a remote village 
of 400 that is predominantly 
Yup’ik Eskimo.

Both alcohol and drug use 

are prohibited in Nick’s village 
350 miles southwest of Anchor-
age, even inside the privacy of 
villagers’ homes.

But Nick fears that the ini-

tiative, in combination with a 
1975 state Supreme Court deci-
sion that legalized marijuana 
use inside homes — could open 
doors to drug abuse.

Initiative backers promised 

Native leaders that communi-
ties could still have local con-
trol under certain conditions. 
Alaska law gives every com-
munity the option to regulate 
alcohol locally. From northern 
Barrow to Klawock, 1,291 miles 
away in southeast Alaska, 108 
communities impose local lim-
its on alcohol, and 33 of them 
ban it altogether.

But the initiative did not 

provide clear opt-out language 
for tribal councils and other 
smaller communities, forcing 
each one to figure out how to 
proceed Tuesday.

November’s initiative also 

bans smoking in public, but 
didn’t define what that means, 
and lawmakers left the ques-
tion to the alcohol regulatory 
board, which planned to meet 
early Tuesday to discuss an 
emergency response.

In Anchorage, Alaska’s larg-

est city, officials tried and 
failed in December to ban a 
new 
commercial 
marijuana 

industry. 
But 
Police 
Chief 

Mark Mew said his officers 
will be strictly enforcing the 
public smoking ban. He even 
warned people against smok-
ing on their porches if they live 
next to a park.

Other officials are still dis-

cussing a proposed cultivation 
ban for the wild Kenai Penin-
sula. But far to the north, in 
North Pole, smoking outdoors 
on private property will be OK 
as long as it doesn’t create a 
nuisance, officials there said.

Stocks and crude 

oils prices fluctuated 
throughout last week 

WASHINGTON (AP) —The 

slump in crude oil prices and 
disappointing U.S. home sales 
data helped nudge stocks 
mostly lower on Monday, 
pulling the market back from 
an all-time high reached last 
week.

The Dow Jones industrial 

average and Standard & Poor’s 
500 index spent much of the 
day hovering slightly below 
their most-recent highs. But 
the Nasdaq composite mount-
ed a late-afternoon comeback 
that extended its recent win 
streak for the ninth day in a 
row.

Oil drilling companies and 

homebuilders notched broad 
declines, while traders bid up 
shares in utilities stocks.

Investors 
were 
look-

ing ahead to the start of a 
two-day round of Congres-
sional testimony by Federal 
Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. 
The remarks could provide 
insight into when the central 
bank will begin raising its key 
interest rate from near zero.

“The markets are in a hold-

ing pattern,” said Erik David-
son, chief investment officer 
of Wells Fargo Private Bank. 
“We’ll have some very inter-
esting information coming up 
from Janet Yellen tomorrow 
and Wednesday, so the mar-
kets are looking at that very 
closely.”

The 
Dow 
ended 
down 

23.60 points, or 0.1 percent, 
to 18,116.84. The S&P 500 
fell 0.64 points, or 0.03 per-
cent, to 2,109.66. The Nasdaq 
gained 5.01 points, or 0.1 per-
cent, to 4,960.97. The index, 
which has yet to reclaim its 
record high from the dot-com 
era, in now within 87 points of 
that March 2000 peak.

The three stock indexes are 

up for the year.

Stocks started off the day 

basically flat as investors 
weighed 
developments 
in 

Greece and falling oil prices.

Greece’s new government 

and its creditors reached an 
agreement over the weekend 
that staved off the threat of a 
Greek bankruptcy and an exit 
from the euro. Athens was 
expected to send creditors 
a list of reforms tied to the 
four-month bailout pact early 
Tuesday.

The price of oil fell for the 

fourth day in a row as the 
return of a Libyan oil field 
raised expectations for more 
oil supply. Benchmark U.S. 
crude fell $1.36 to close at 
$49.45 a barrel in New York.

That helped drag down 

shares in several offshore oil 
drilling and oilfield services 
companies.

Transocean fell 75 cents, or 

4.4 percent, to $16.26, while 
Ensco shed $1.11, or 3.7 per-
cent, to $28.65. Nabors Indus-
tries fell the most among 
stocks in the S&P 500, los-
ing 67 cents, or 5 percent, to 
$12.85.

Investors bought up shares 

in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, 
which announced on Sun-
day a deal to buy rival drug-
maker Salix Pharmaceuticals 
for about $10 billion in cash. 
Valeant rose $25.49, or 15 per-
cent, to $198.75.

A 
midmorning 
report 

showing that sales of previ-
ously occupied homes tum-
bled 4.9 percent last month 
sent most homebuilder shares 
lower. UCP declined the most, 
shedding 45 cents, or 4.8 per-
cent, to $8.97.

“The home numbers were a 

little disappointing,” said Bob 
Doll, chief equity strategist at 
Nuveen Asset Management.

All told, six of the 10 sectors 

in the S&P 500 fell. Telecom-
munications stocks declined 

the most. Utilities stocks led 
the gainers.

Tuesday will provide inves-

tors with some fresh insight 
on the U.S. consumer.

The Conference Board will 

report its latest consumer 
confidence index. January’s 
reading surged to the highest 
level since August 2007, and 
economists anticipate a pull-
back in this month’s reading.

But the biggest market-

moving news could come from 
the Fed.

Yellen 
is 
scheduled 
to 

deliver her semiannual report 
to Congress on the economy 
and interest rates. Investors 
will be listening for any hints 
of when the central bank will 
move to raise its key interest 
rate. Higher Fed rates would 
affect rates on many con-
sumer and business loans and 
could depress stock and bond 
prices.

The 
Fed’s 
most 
recent 

policy statement expressed 
the intention to be “patient” 
about raising rates. Many 
economists have predicted 
the central bank will raise 
rates in June.

In 
other 
futures 
trad-

ing Monday, Brent crude, a 
benchmark for international 
oils used by many U.S. refin-
eries, fell $1.32 to close at 
$58.90 in London. Wholesale 
gasoline rose 0.5 cents to 
close at $1.646 a gallon. Heat-
ing oil rose 10.6 cents to close 
at $2.218 a gallon, and natural 
gas fell 7.2 cents to close at 
$2.879 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Precious 
and 
industrial 

metals futures closed slight-
ly lower. Gold fell $4.10 to 
$1,200.80 an ounce, silver fell 
two cents to $16.25 an ounce 
and copper edged down less 
than a penny to $2.59 a pound.

U.S. 
government 
bond 

prices rose. The yield on the 
10-year Treasury note fell to 
2.06 percent from 2.11 percent 
late Friday.

Kid Rock disappoints

In latest album, Kid 
Rock sings his way 

to irrelevance

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

There’s this clip on YouTube 

from Jimmy Kimmel’s show called 
Celebrities Read Mean Tweets #4. 
It’s self-explan-
atory what goes 
down in this seg-
ment — celebri-
ties read tweets 
from their hat-
ers. 
At 
about 

the two-minute 
mark, right when 
it’s starting to get uninteresting, 
Kid Rock pops up, clad in a camo 
vest, black fedora and those sig-
nature aviator shades. His hate-
tweet says, “Kid Rock looks like 
he would smell like stale farts and 
cigarettes.” 

He jokes, saying it ought to be 

“fresh farts and cigars.” Indeed, 
that would be a blessing. But if 
we’re talking in terms of Kid 
Rock’s music, and using the gassy 
tobacco metaphor, it tends to 
sound like stale farts and ciga-
rettes. “Stale” in that it’s a bit tired, 
reliant on past heartland rock 
musician’s inventiveness and lyri-
cally fixated on nostalgia. “Ciga-
rettes” in that it deals with many 
vice-y substances, like booze and 
smokes and women, oh my. And 
“farts” in that sometimes — well, 
most of the time — it stinks.

Rock’s latest endeavor, First 

Kiss, is no exception to any of the 
aforementioned, putrid quirks. 
Rooted more in country than rock, 
though marketed as a fusion of the 
two genres, the album is repeti-

tive, melodically static and unin-
ventive. Rock was going for Bob 
Seger but instead got scratchy, 
probably-got-lost-on-his-way-
home 
John 
Mellencamp; 
it’s 

heartland with heart, sans talent. 

The titular track, “First Kiss,” 

has been getting a lot of airplay 
and rightfully so — it’s the best 
on the album, or if we’re doing 
metaphors again, the best house 
on the crummiest block in the 
neighborhood. Nevertheless, its 
light, country-pop aura is pleasing 
and uncontrollably catchy. Sooner 
than later, the listener is cruising 
along the lake and pining for their 
first love right next to Rock. But 
that bliss doesn’t last long.

Country, exclamation point, is 

spewed at us from all directions. 
In “Good Times, Cheap Wine,” 
Rock stresses his love for the 
simple things in life — hey, let the 
good times roll. “If you’re lookin’ 
for a hot mess, well honey, here 
I am,” he sings. He knows. He’s 
accepting his gassy tobacco status. 
This song, complete with saloon 
keys and gritty guitars, sounds 
like something you would hear in 
some rusty bar. The same goes for 
“Good Time Lookin’ For Me” and 
“The Best of Me” — their twangy 
fiddles and southern drawls solid-
ify their airtime in Applebee’s 
restaurants nationwide. Happy 
listening, folks; enjoy your Bud 
Light.

“Johnny Cash” is interesting 

— it couldn’t be farther from the 
man in black, and is, in fact, an ode 
to Rock’s lady love. He wants to 
be her Johnny Cash. Sweet, huh? 
It’s pure, unadulterated cheese 
on more levels than one — it’s in 
the same key as every other song 
on the album, the lyrics sounds 
the same as all the others on the 
album and Kid Rock’s Detroit-

turned-backwater-Kentucky 
accent is the cherry on top of it 
all. This tune is uniquely marked 
with a few gospel singers in the 
background, though, who serve 
no other purpose than to mimic 
fragments of Kid’s shite lyrics. 
When he sings, “I want to be 
your Johnny Cash,” they answer, 
“JOHNNY CASH WOAH YEAH 
WOAH,” and so on. It’s chilling 
stuff.

It all turns painful when “Ain’t 

Enough Whiskey” comes along, 
with its annoying chorus that 
follows the same melodic and 
rhythmic line as — not kidding 
— the bunny hop. “Drinking Beer 
With Dad” tries to be profound 
but instead sounds like a Face-
book status from an unseasoned 
user who doesn’t really know 
what to say. Take it from us, Kid: 
if you can’t find the words, it’s 
best to just keep quiet. 

The penultimate track, “One 

More Song,” cheekily tells the lis-
tener to hang on for just a bit lon-
ger. Reassurance is quite needed 
at this point in the First Kiss 
journey, but the actual song has 
bizarre techno inflections and 
they, in addition to Rock’s extra-
screechy voice, lend to really 
weird vibes. 

But finally it ends, praise 

the lord — actually, the latter is 
exactly what Rock does in his 
swan song, “Jesus and Boce-
phus.” Yes, these are the album’s 
final words, and yes, he chose to 
fill them with deep, emotional 
thanks to his lords and saviors, 
Jesus Christ and Hank Williams, 
Jr. (a.k.a. Bocephus). It’s all so Kid 
Rock. He is who he is, and that’s 
commendable. 

But who is he? Well, he’s stale 

farts and cigarettes. And most 
people can’t deal with that shit.

FILM NOTEBOOK

‘Mommy’ a 
heartbreaker

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

The film “Mommy” bears ach-

ing similarities to its protagonist, 
Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon, “Lau-
rence Anyways”), 
a 
15-year-old 

boy with violent 
tendencies, 
an 

attachment 
dis-

order and ADHD. 
Both 
have 
the 

capacity to display 
effusive love, but 
turn on you quickly with coryban-
tic rage. Both are a feverish whirl-
wind of passion that you can’t look 
away from. And both will utterly 
break your heart. 

“Mommy” is ultimately a story of 

the fierce love between mother and 
child. Set in a fictionalized Canada 
where parents have the option of 
institutionalizing children with 
behavioral issues, the titular moth-
er, Diane (Anne Dorval, “Laurence 
Anyways”), is a tough and swagger-
ing widow in extreme debt. When 
she gets the call that her son Steve is 
being kicked out of a youth facility 
for setting a fire in which another 
child is gravely injured, they must 
band together as a team to get their 
lives back in order. Steve’s hazard-
ous antics put a dark cloud over 
Diane’s life, portrayed through 
the shadowy lighting she is con-
sistently in, while Steve is almost 
always bathed in sunlight, trying to 
find sensation through any means 
possible. However, Steve’s unpre-
dictable habits have as much pro-
pensity towards gentle love as they 
do towards senseless violence.

In the crossfire of Steve’s highs 

and lows is Kyla (Suzanne Clément, 
“I Killed My Mother”), their neigh-
bor. Kyla is a high-school teacher 
on sabbatical with a terrible stut-
ter. Diane enlists the traumatized 

woman to homeschool Steve while 
she cleans houses to support the 
family. In these hours alone with 
Steve’s mania, Kyla demonstrates 
that she has as much strength as the 
young and muscular teenager. But 
unlike Steve’s irrational and arbi-
trary outbursts of anger, her mad-
ness is restrained and tight-fisted, 
making it even more terrifying to 
witness. 

Kyla inspires a frisson of love 

and happiness in their lives; this 
climaxes in Steve longboarding and 
literally pushing open the edges 
of the screen to create room for 
his joy while “Wonderwall” blasts 
through their suburban streets. 
But the stress of their impending 
life together weighs heavy on the 
relationships, and tensions start to 
build as Steve begins to perilously 
break down.

For most of the movie, the cam-

era work of 25-year-old direc-
tor 
Xavier 
Dolan 
(“Laurence 

Anyways”) composes the frame 
in a claustrophobic square, trap-
ping the characters in a world for 
which their energies are far too 
large. Their relationship is gut-
wrenchingly loving and without 
the boundaries of a typical mater-
nal relationship that keep society’s 
expectations intact. The exuberant 
personalities of Steve and Diane 
are uncomfortably close in the tiny 
screen, illustrating the intensity of 
their bond and the need for space 
in the erratic relationship. 

With narrow framing and a 

small cast, it’s truly incredible how 
much life is packed into the film. 
The film draws in the viewer with 
the allure of the unhealthy but 
passionately-loving relationship of 
the unendingly complex Diane and 
Steve. “Mommy” traps its charac-
ters and audience in a volatile and 
boisterous grasp until someone 
must break free.

‘Boyhood’ overlooked

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editor

For the sake of this argument, 

“Birdman” and “Boyhood” were 
the two contenders, pitted by 
the media against each other, 
partly for dramatic intensity and 
also because they both involved 
impressive technical experiments.

I reviewed “Birdman” and 

“Boyhood” and gave them both an 
A. For all the flack I gave my col-
leagues for preferring “Birdman,” 
I enjoyed it. It was an intellectual 
puzzle I saw twice to pry out its 
minute and meticulously placed 
details. Every minute in “Bird-
man” is a pulsing nerve center of 
soundtrack, writing and, of course, 
cinematography. And the cinema-
tography is riveting — nothing 
Hitchcock hasn’t done, mind you 
— but it barrels the movie through 
its psychological labyrinth of artis-
tic anxiety. “Birdman” is an exam-
ple of form marshaled to function 
with militaristic precision; it’s 
never superfluous or sybaritic, 
except as an intentional represen-
tation of Michael Keaton’s (“Bee-
tlejuice”) own grandiosity. But 
even as “Birdman” ’s form is care-
ful to never overwhelm content, 
form makes “Birdman.” This is a 
paean to the well-oiled machines 
that create art — the story is sec-
ondary. It’s a film’s film.

And so I reveal my very unfash-

ionable hand: “Birdman” didn’t 
stick to me. Yes, audience effect 
should theoretically not be part 
of a movie’s critique, but for all its 
formalistic brilliance, “Birdman” 
is the equivalent of reading a bril-
liant modernist poem, something 
undergirded by a frame of perfect 
logic and organization. “Birdman” 
delights in its difficulty. Even as 
“Birdman” uses its tour-de-force 
camerawork and jarring drum-
beating soundtrack to transform 

the screen into a psychic state, it 
rejects any emotional association 
with its protagonist.

Any other year, that would have 

been OK. I’m outing myself as an 
unapologetic sentimentalist when 
I say “Boyhood” clung to me far 
beyond the hot summer afternoon 
I saw it, and that’s why I champion 
it as the winner between the two.

I was talking to a fellow edi-

tor yesterday who felt that “Boy-
hood” ’s lack of storic importance 
disqualified it from something like 
the Oscars. I don’t love the Oscars 
(didn’t even watch them, oops) 
but I vehemently disagree that 
we need history to be stretched 
out on screen for an Oscar. But 
if that’s the case, “Birdman” still 
isn’t the frontrunner. Both films 
are accounts of trivial, yet taken 
in wildly different directions. If 
“Birdman” tamps its storyline 
about — let’s face it — a run-of-
the-mill midlife crisis with unten-
able drama, “Boyhood” refuses to 
impose its story with artificial nar-
rative. Its ‘gimmick,’ as I said in my 
review of the film, isn’t a gimmick. 
It dissolves into the screen after 
the first few time-jumps, allowing 
life to swell like never before to 
the screen’s surface. Where “Bird-
man” never lets you forget about its 
camera, “Boyhood” creates tempo-
rary amnesia of form.

And for those 165 minutes, I 

felt swallowed up by “Boyhood.” 
There are few similarities between 
Mason Jr. (newcomer Ellar Col-
trane) and I; we consider ourselves 
‘creative-types’ and didn’t love 
high school (who did?), but that’s 
it — he’s an adolescent Texan boy 
with divorced parents. Yet mapped 
on the screen, his moments strung 
together in the constellation of life 
resonated with mine, too. Quiet 
sorrows, like Mason Jr.’s disci-
plinarian stepfather shaving off 
his beautiful head of hair unfold 
against the muted joys, like having 
a great conversation with a girl at a 
party, are folded in along with the 
funny, mundane and ugly. There 
are moments of triumph, but this 
isn’t an epic retelling of life. Every-
thing in “Boyhood” is contained 
within its ordinary bounds.

This could seem effortless, or 

even accidental, but “Boyhood” 

is held together nonetheless by a 
near-perfect 
invisible 
structure 

that rivals “Birdman” ’s. While the 
physical changes in “Boyhood” ’s 
cast are certainly the most appar-
ent, this filming process allowed an 
experimental form of writing. Rich-
ard Linklater completed the script 
as he shot, rewriting the script after 
reviewing the footage from the most 
previous year. The result is a script 
which reflects on and absorbs itself 
as it grows. As Mason Jr. developed, 
the script too underwent its own 
parallel coming of age. 

“Life doesn’t have a plot, and 

neither does ‘Boyhood,’” is what 
I tell people who complain that 
the movie is pointless. That’s 
pithy, but by granting life a 
screen, unfettered by climaxes 
and rising action and foreshad-
owing (notice how Linklater 
denied that college love-inter-
est Nicole (Jessi Mechler, “Mor-
ganville”) was the same Nicole 
who passed Mason Jr. a note in 
middle school), “Boyhood” runs 
headlong into that sensation 
most movies may only graze if 
lucky: seeing life, not just imi-
tated, but created on a screen.

This veers into debates of art: 

is it to reflect or shatter real-
ity? To comfort or to disorient? 
Normally, I gravitate towards 
the disruptive qualities of art, 
work like the Dadaists who 
Walter Benjamin said “turned 
art into a missile.” And “Bird-
man” reminds me of the trans-
formative gears of art, of its 
ability to pummel and reshape 
reality. But “Boyhood” uses its 
quietly brilliant form for other 
uses. Watching “Boyhood” fills 
me with that deep and corny 
feeling of solidarity with the 
human species.

“Boyhood” 

creates 

temporary 

amnesia of form.

Moth event unites 
through storytelling

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

For The Daily

If nothing else, “The DUFF” 

illustrates the ability of truly 
capable actors to redeem limp 
comedic mate-
rial. In almost 
every way, the 
new film from 
director 
Ari 

Sandel 
(the 

Oscar-winning 
short 
film 

“West 
Bank 

Story”) is forgettable, peppered 
with teen movie clichés and 
recycled rom-com plots, but 
its cast elevates even the direst 
jokes.

Written by Josh A. Cagan (the 

underrated “Bandslam”), “The 
DUFF” puts forth the idea that 
each friend group in high school 
includes a “DUFF”: the “Desig-
nated Ugly Fat Friend.” Mae 
Whitman (“Parenthood”) plays 
Bianca, who discovers that she 
is the DUFF of her group, and 
cuts off all ties with her best 
friends, Jess (Skyler Samuels, 
“American Horror Story: Freak 
Show”) and Casey (Bianca A. 
Santos, “The Fosters”). Seek-
ing to become successful in 
her own dating life instead of 
simply being the approachable, 
less attractive friend, Bianca 
arranges a deal with childhood 
friend and football quarterback 
Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell, 
“The Flash”). In exchange for 
Bianca’s 
help 
with 
passing 

chemistry, Wes will teach her 
how to land her crush.

If you think you know where 

this is going, you’re probably 
right; Bianca begins to wonder 
if Wes is actually the one for 
her, and the standard rom-com 
beats follow. Luckily, Whitman 
and Amell are fantastic in their 
roles, each lending a self-aware-
ness to offset their stereotypi-
cal roles: the flannel-wearing, 
Japanese-cult-horror-movie-
watching quirky girl and the 
obnoxious jock man-whore (a 
phrase the film uses a number 
of times), respectively. Bianca’s 
scenes of nervous mumble-
flirting could be grating based 
on Cagan’s script, but Whit-
man makes the character both 
self-deprecating and genuinely 
concerned about her social 
image. Her facial expressions 
and physical movements alone 

are enough to make the char-
acter immediately endearing. 
Every scene between Bianca 
and Wesley crackles with unex-
pected chemistry, assisted by 
Wes’s continual failure to stifle 
his laughter when Bianca makes 
dumb jokes.

One begins to wish the movie 

could just be 100 minutes of 
Bianca and Wesley hanging 
out, because most of the film’s 
conflict feels forced. Jess and 
Casey never suggest any malev-
olence in their friendship with 
Bianca, so the disintegration of 
the group dynamic feels hol-
low and pointless. Jess’s sole 
distinguishing quality is that 
she’s a future fashion design-
er, and Casey’s one quality is 
that she likes hacking. These 
hobbies, instead of suggesting 
inner lives for the characters, 
function as plot conveniences. 
Same goes for Madison (Bella 
Thorne, “Shake It Up”), Wes’s 
on-and-off girlfriend who never 
achieves complexity like Regi-
na George from “Mean Girls” 
or other queen-of-the-school 
characters 
in 
teen 
movies. 

Madison is a bland antagonist, 
stirring up trouble and embar-
rassing Bianca whenever she 
gets the chance, and she’s so 
unlikable that it’s impossible to 
find her “what the shit” catch-
phrase or desperate desire for 
fame remotely funny.

Sandel cultivates an amica-

ble energy to the proceedings, 
though he generally doesn’t do 
much to give the film its own 
distinct personality aside from 

occasional over-the-top fanta-
sy sequences. His scenes with 
Whitman and Amell, though, 
seem more genuine and real, 
relying on fun banter and fly-
ing sparks instead of pandering 
quirks like the name-dropping 
of social media apps. One might 
be tempted to read into the 
inherent misogyny of a man 
teaching a woman how to dress 
and be more appealing to men, 
especially because the other 
end of the deal — Bianca lend-
ing Wes her chemistry notes 
— hardly equals the extensive 
training Wes gives Bianca. The 
early scenes reflect this imbal-
ance; Amell is much taller than 
the 5’1” Whitman, and as they 
walk together on the track, 
Bianca begging Wes to help 
her, he towers over her in the 
frame. Luckily, their dynamic 
changes. The film’s best scene, 
in which Bianca and Wes sit 
together on ‘Think Rock’ and 
have a deep conversation, is 
framed so that Wes and Bianca 
are level with each other. This 
ups the sexual tension due to 
their proximity, but it also sub-
tly shows how their dynamic 
has shifted.

The movie culminates in a 

bland ‘be yourself’ scene at the 
homecoming dance, like “Mean 
Girls” but without the punch 
of catharsis. It’s a shame that 
“The DUFF” brings nothing 
new to the table, but it should, 
at least, send a clear message 
to comedy writers everywhere: 
put Mae Whitman and Robbie 
Amell in more movies.

“Her?”

FILM NOTEBOOK

By JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

This was the year I was going 

to be ready for the damn Oscars. 
For the first time ever, I had seen 
every single Best Picture nomi-
nee. I filled out a predictions 
checklist. I ordered pizza. I even 
invited real, talking, breathing 
people over to my house (a rar-
ity) to watch it with me. I was 
ready for everything. Everything 
except for the Oscars being total-
ly boring. 

Did the event even have a host? 

Neil Patrick Harris was certainly 
in attendance, but his charm, 
wit and soul were all painfully 
absent. His pun-heavy jokes were 
entirely lame, and his “predic-
tions” shtick with Octavia Spen-
cer, while first appearing to be a 

cool Barney Stinson-esque string-
along magic trick, went absolute-
ly nowhere. The one truly funny 
gag he pulled (the very clever 
“Birdman” 
and 
“Whiplash” 

mash-up skit with Miles Teller) 
lacked NPH flair; any Oscar host 
could have performed it. His safe, 
unfunny performance was espe-
cially disappointing in compari-
son to his fabulous track record 
hosting the Tony Awards, where 
his immense talent can be unfil-
tered, rather than tragically held 
back by an Academy somehow 
still reeling from a way-out-there, 
actually funny Seth MacFarlane 
in 2013. 

But it wasn’t just the host who 

was boring. The awards them-
selves were underachieving. The 
only picks that were remotely 
surprising were “Birdman” ’s 

many wins over “Boyhood” (not 
even that surprising given “Bird-
man” ’s late-game dominance 
at the SAG Awards) and the vic-
tory of Alexandre Desplat’s “The 
Grand Budapest Hotel” score 
over the others. Every other vic-
tory was given to the safe and 
sensible choice. Perhaps that’s a 
good thing. It’s good to see the 
Academy voters give out awards 
to recipients that pretty univer-
sally make sense. Selfishly, I was 
hoping that a few more black 
sheep would win big, but alas, it 
seems that this year especially, 
the Oscars are about as main-
stream as awards shows get. 

There was a grand total of one 

thing that surprised during the 
2015 ceremony, and that was Lady 
Gaga. Her mind-blowing surprise 
tribute to Julie Andrews for the 

50th anniversary of “The Sound 
of Music” was not only incredi-
bly on-point musically, but clear-
ly heartfelt — you could feel the 
amount of love and respect Gaga 
had for Andrews’s work emanat-
ing from her set. The normally 
flamboyant, 
overly-sexualized 

Gaga was simply poised and 
powerful here, showing a com-
pletely different side of her tal-
ent than the public is used to. 
Consider me now vastly inter-
ested in her recent work with 
Tony Bennett — according to my 
girlfriend, similar levels of non-
pop Gaga talent are showcased 
there. Anyway, the moment was 
only sweetened when Andrews 
herself stepped out and the 
crowd went absolutely bonkers. 

Despite the show’s stubborn 

insistence on being unmemo-

rable and staid, certain award 
recipients decided to actually 
take on a bit of daring, deliver-
ing some powerful acceptance 
speeches. Notable ones included 
Common and John Legend’s 
(Best Original Song, “Glory” 
from “Selma”) rousing com-
mentary on current activism, 
as well as Patricia Arquette’s 
(Best Supporting Actress, “Boy-
hood”) plea for equalizing the 
gender pay gap. Most salient 
of all was Alejandro González 
Iñarritu’s 
(“Birdman”) 
clos-

ing Best Picture acceptance 
speech, in which he encouraged 
the nation to think differently 
about Mexican immigration — a 
rare message indeed to hear on 
mainstream television. If the 
show itself had been half as dar-
ing as these inspiring speeches, 

it would have been one of the 
better shows in Oscar history. 
Unfortunately, the awards tried 
far too hard to please everyone, 
ending up a total snore. 

P.S.: Where the hell was the 

remembrance for Joan Rivers 
during the “in memoriam” seg-
ment? What a horrible, disre-
spectful oversight.

Daydreaming of losing big at the Oscars.

Monthly Ann Arbor 
event a showcase for 
personal narratives

By KAREN HUA 

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Fluorescent colors illuminated 

the ice as they steamed from neon 
signs. Even before the show, Cir-
cus Bar had us wound up in a line 
that stretched down the block, a 
line of locals eager to wait despite 
the chill of midweek blues.

I met my English class and my 

professor as the day was grow-
ing dark, but Circus was light-
ing up. We were lucky to have 
tickets in hand already because, 
as one of Ann Arbor’s hidden 
gems, the Moth StorySLAM sells 
out instantly every month. As 
a University student, it’s espe-
cially easy to get caught up in 
the “Michigan bubble” (the fur-
thest I’ve ventured from campus 
is probably Main Street). But, for 
that Tuesday night, I felt like a 
local among the eclectic crowd, 
simply gathered by the fascina-
tion of storytelling.

Cradling our sodas and pop-

corn bowls, we squeezed around 
to find seats despite arriving an 
hour and a half early. The bar 
emitted a welcome vibrancy from 
the frigidity of the outdoors, an 
enthusiasm that embraced us in 
warmth. Next to us lounged a 
rambunctious guy who cussed 
every other sentence; behind us 
sat two elderly girlfriends on their 
GNO; by our right was a group of 
alternatively-dressed college stu-
dents. It was a snug venue for the 
popularity of the event, but our 
physical proximity forced us all 
to small talk and share our own 
minute stories while we waited.

The idea of StorySLAM is 

simple: real people face a live 
audience to tell a true story about 
themselves in just five minutes. 
The event is hosted by NPR’s 
Moth radio hour, and in Michi-
gan, the event comes to Ann 
Arbor’s Circus Bar every third 
week of the month and Detroit’s 
Cliff Bells club the first week of 
each month.

There are usually 10 perform-

ing storytellers among 300 in the 
audience, where most attendees 
are either regulars or newcom-
ers. Throughout the entire night, 
the audience remained recep-
tive, clapping heartily for every 
performer and reciprocating the 
same energy that radiated from 
the stage. For storytellers, both 
first-timers and veterans, the 
experience can be daunting – but 
the audience was there to pro-
vide support rather than critique. 
After all, the theme of the night 
was “adventure.”

The general public’s under-

standing 
of 
“storytelling” 
is 

muddled – appreciated by some, 
ambiguous to others. The oral 
tradition lies at the root of the 
written word: what we read in 
print, on screen, on social media. 
However, storytelling is often an 
overlooked art, overshadowed 
by digital media’s domineering 
presence. Thus, the Moth aims 

to spread awareness about story-
telling’s growing prevalence – to 
debunk myths about its archaic 
nature.

At the core, the event spreads 

poignant stories that need to be 
shared. In doing so, people may 
learn how their mundane lives 
can evoke primal understanding 
from larger audiences. In their 
ordinary lives, there may be inspi-
ration for others. In turn, these 
storytellers may gain a newfound 
understanding of themselves.

Patricia “Patty” Wheeler, the 

Michigan StorySLAM producer, 
introduced us to the concept 
with an infectious vivacity. Dou-
bling as emcee for the night, she 
encouraged 
audience 
interac-

tion by asking for anonymous 
contributions in response to the 
prompt: “Tell us about a time 
you had no idea what would hap-
pen, but you went for it anyway.” 
Between performances, she read 
the micro-stories aloud – short 
but earnest anecdotes of find-
ing future spouses, discovering 
beauty amid the chaos of par-
enthood and other life-changing 
experiences summed up in two 
sentences. 

First to perform was Grace, a 

stout middle-aged woman who 
fervently recounted her – tragic, 
albeit hilarious – diarrhea experi-
ence in Mexico as an adolescent. 
The irony between her maternal 
appearance and her zany tone set 
the vibe for the night – an atmo-
sphere of honesty and mutual 
acceptance. 

Many stories proceeded to 

narrate comedic misadventures 
like hers – study abroad experi-
ences gone awry, evading respon-
sibility or inciting debauchery as 
adults. It became difficult to dis-
cern the novices from the veter-
ans, as the environment allowed 
for a comfort among all parties. 
Each performer carried a natural 
ability to speak candidly with-
out concern of being rehearsed 
or well-versed. What mattered 
most was the story delivery over 
content. Simple stories were often 
the most affectively complex. 

Such was Emily Elizabeth 

“E.E.” Scott, whose story added 
a deeper dimension to the night’s 
predominantly humorous vibe. 
She spoke sincerely about her 
mother’s memory loss, a tragedy 
turned into an “I fear no fate” 
tattoo. Her performance elic-
ited tears, but also occasional 
chuckles of recognition – dual 
sensations that left us in speech-
lessness afterward. For Scott, 
a young Ann Arbor regular but 
first-time storyteller, her ease 
onstage convinced us all she had 
done this dozens of times before.

Scott explained, “Storytelling 

in person is different from any 
other type, because it’s almost 
like you have less control and 
you might not know what’s going 
to happen. You might surprise 
yourself in your words, whereas 
in writing, you know what you’re 
going to do, or you have the power 
to edit, at least.” 

Scott proved that storytelling’s 

heart lies in its primal nature. 
Most of the audience probably 
had never had explosive diar-
rhea in Mexico or a mother fading 

away with memory loss – but we 
did have our individual experi-
ences with love, loss and adven-
ture that translated into shared 
understanding. 

Wheeler started as an essay-

ist and Moth volunteer three 
and a half years ago. She men-
tioned how just after attending 
one event, she saw the three-way 
link between the writer and the 
speaker, and the importance of 
hearing the story as a listener. 
Writers and speakers alike are 
storytellers, but sharing expe-
riences aloud for a responsive 
audience can be cathartic and 
revitalizing in ways writing in 
solitude cannot.

She told us, “When you hear 

somebody and you see their face 
… hearing the emotion in some-
body’s story helps connect to your 
own life and the emotions that 
you have.”

As evidenced by the night, 

there’s so much to be learned 
from fellow human experiences. 
With live, spoken-word stories, 
there’s an immediacy and an inti-
macy, a holistic sensation that 
accompanies each tale told. By 
seeing and hearing the speaker 
face to face, their emotions are 
unadulterated by our own inter-
pretations when we read. 

Theorist 
Walter 
Benjamin 

calls “the author as producer,” 
referring to how oral tradition 
gives authority back to the story-
teller. In true tales, the facts will 
remain, but storytelling inspires 
communication with listeners 
and control over the presenta-
tion. Whereas novels and written 
word distance the reader from 
the writer, storytelling has an 
accessible closeness.

“Everybody has stories in their 

lives that have stuck with them, 
and if we give the opportunity 
for everyday people … to get up 
and tell true stories … that helps 
everybody else know that their 
lives are also special and dynam-
ic, and that they have stories that 
are worth sharing,” Wheeler 
said.

Though many bemoan the 

decline of the oral tradition, 
events like StorySLAM attest to 
the revival of true stories, and 
how they are becoming increas-
ingly important in our technolog-
ical age. Ultimately, the Moth’s 
greater mission is to elucidate 
how we all can be storytellers, 
and then to use digital means of 
storytelling to share this honesty 
we put forth. Wheeler noted sim-
ilar foundations – 2nd Story in 
Chicago, massmouth StoriesLive 
in Boston, the National Storytell-
ing Network in Tennessee – and 
many more with aims akin. 

“There’s this giant resurgence 

of oral storytelling that’s happen-
ing all around the country and all 
around the world,” Wheeler said. 
“It’s only going to get stronger 
and stronger through commu-
nity experiences like this.”

At the end of the event, we left 

buzzed from the heartwarming 
vibes of good people, good art 
and a good night. As we departed 
for the cold outdoors, many of us 
vowed to return next month to 
add our own kindling to the fiery 
passion for stories.

Senior Night key for team on bubble

After multiple close 

losses, Michigan 

looks to get back on 

winning track

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Writer

Considering 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team’s recent 
string of last-
second defeats, 
it 
would 

make sense to 
suspect 
that 

the Wolverines 
are 
feeling 

downtrodden.

After senior 

forward Nicole 
Elmblad’s 
buzzer-beating 
putback 
propelled 

Michigan (7-9 Big Ten, 15-12 
overall) to overtime against 
Minnesota, it appeared that a 
contest would finally fall in favor 
of the Wolverines. After three 
close February losses that were 
decided in the final minute of 
play, Michigan’s turn to steal 
a victory away seemed within 
reach.

Saturday’s game in Minnesota 

didn’t 
end 
any 
differently, 

though, as the Wolverines lost in 
double overtime.

“We’re getting better, we just 

haven’t gotten a victory in one of 
these yet,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “But let’s just 
keep slugging away. I was proud 
of our effort and how we were 
down, and we didn’t quit, and 
we fought back and persevered. I 
think our team is really growing 
and continuing to improve.”

Tuesday, 
Purdue 
(3-13, 

10-17) will attempt to ruin the 
Wolverines’ Senior Night, when 

four-year starter Elmblad, two-
year starting forward Cyesha 
Goree and two-year starting 
transfer guard Shannon Smith 
will be honored prior to the 
game.

The 

Wolverines did 
show marked 
improvements 
against 
Minnesota. 
Goree 
stayed 

out 
of 
foul 

trouble while 
battling center 
Amanda 
Zahui 
B. 
— 

the 2014 Big 
Ten Freshman of the Year — 
and freshman guard Katelynn 
Flaherty scored a career-high 27 
points.

Flaherty, who has started 

the last two games, is looking 
more and more comfortable in 
pressure situations. After being 

named a starter, Flaherty put an 
enormous amount of pressure on 
Indiana and Minnesota, scoring 
48 points in total.

Goree was also able to tack on 

26 points and 20 boards against 

Indiana 
despite 
being 

double-
teamed 
all 

game. Against 
Purdue, she’ll 
look to emulate 
Saturday’s 
results 
while 

also remaining 
disciplined.

“For 

(Goree), 
she 

has to realize that it’s not all 
about her scoring all the time,” 
Barnes Arico said. “If people are 
really focused on her that much, 
and sending two and three 
people to her, it’s good for our 
team.”

“It’s going to open things up 

for her teammates, and it might 
not result in her numbers in the 
stat sheet being 20 points, but 
it’s resulting in Katelynn having 
20 
points, 
and 
(sophomore 

guard Siera Thompson) having 
open looks and Nicole Elmblad 
cutting to the basket.”

Goree, Flaherty, Thompson 

and Smith are all averaging 
double figures in scoring, so if 
Goree fouls out or is covered too 
heavily, the other three will be 
relied on offensively.

A 
loss 
would 
completely 

wipe out Michigan’s chances 
of making an at-large bid to the 
NCAA Tournament, barring an 
incredible Big Ten Tournament 
performance, 
which 
would 

likely have to include beating No. 
5 Maryland.

There 
are 
two 
games 

remaining on the Wolverines’ 
schedule before the conference 
tournament in Hoffman Estates, 
Illinois. After losing four games 
in February, they will have to 
win the final two.

Doing so might give a jolt 

of morale to a team that needs 
to 
overcome 
its 
late-season 

struggles to have any chance 
of 
an 
NCAA 
tournament 

appearance.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

“We just 

haven’t gotten a 
victory in one of 

those yet.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Shortage of time
issue for Michigan

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Time is running out for the 

Michigan men’s basketball team.

Despite an upset win over 

Ohio State on Sunday, Michigan’s 
chances for a postseason bid 
remain up in the air. And while 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament 
or 

NIT remains the goal for the 
Wolverines, 
Michigan 
coach 

John Beilein has other concerns 
for a season approaching its 
conclusion.

Specifically, Beilein wants to 

teach his young team as much 
as it can learn before summer 
approaches and practice time is 
limited.

“While some might be dialing 

back in their practice right now, 
we’re actually practicing more 
with those guys, cause they need 
this fundamental work,” Beilein 
said. “When the season’s over, we 
get two hours a week for a couple 
weeks, and then it’s the summer. 
So we’re trying to use every 
valuable minute.”

For the majority of Michigan’s 

team, the learning process has 
been rushed. After primarily 
playing an eight-man rotation 
that relied heavily on junior 
guards Spike Albrecht and Caris 
LeVert, sophomore guard Derrick 
Walton 
Jr. 
and 
sophomore 

forward Zak Irvin earlier in the 
season, the Wolverines were 
forced to readjust their lineup.

Due mostly to injuries to 

LeVert and Walton, Michigan 
had to adjust on the fly and do 
what Beilein was so hesitant to do 
before: throw his inexperienced 
youngsters into the fire.

“There’s 
a 
reason 
that 

(freshman guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman) and (freshman 
guard Aubrey Dawkins) were 
not playing early,” Beilein said. 
“Their timing was bad. They 
were just figuring it out, like 
freshmen should be. And so all 
of a sudden they had to play a lot 
of minutes — they weren’t very 
efficient offensively. So we’ve 

gotten better offensively. We’ve 
been tweaking like crazy.”

Such changes were evident 

Sunday, as freshman forward 
Ricky 
Doyle 
and 
redshirt 

freshman forward Mark Donnal 
combined for 10 points in 23 
minutes 
of 
action. 
Playing 

aggressively and with two feet 
planted in the paint, like Beilein 
has preached recently, the duo 
didn’t back down against the 
Buckeyes’ 
senior 
frontcourt 

of Sam Thompson and Amir 
Williams.

“For Ricky, who’s 18, playing 

against these 22-year-olds, it’s 
a challenge,” Beilein said. “And 
Mark is 19. It’s a big challenge.”

While practice helps with 

the development of Michigan’s 
budding young core, watching the 
play of older, more experienced 
players like Albrecht and senior 
forward Max Bielfeldt is also 
impactful.

Bielfeldt’s 
seven 
rebounds, 

including three on the offensive 
glass, and his dive on the floor to 
gain possession late in the second 
half showed the type of effort and 
resolve Beilein expects from his 
players.

“Our young guys are learning 

about a sense of urgency,” Beilein 
said. “Max’s clock is running out. 
He wants to go and get that ball, 
whereas typical young guys will 
be, ‘I’ll get it next time.’ Max, I 
think, has realized there isn’t a 
next time and I’m going to get 
that ball.”

Whereas Bielfeldt took a leaf 

out of Albrecht’s playbook by 
diving on the ground, Albrecht 
mimicked former Wolverine Trey 
Burke with his game-sealing 
steal of D’Angelo Russell in the 
final minute and his multiple 
step-back jumpers throughout 
the contest.

It’s that type of play that 

represents 
what 
college 

basketball should be, according 
to Beilein.

And if Michigan wants to 

make a run, it’ll need plenty more 
of it.

‘Children’ support Red, make the opponents blue

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

The 
applause 
and 
name 

chanting 
poured 
down 
to 

the ice at Adam Wilcox. The 
Minnesota 
netminder 
had 

heard it all before, but unlike his 
standout performances in net in 
Minneapolis, the junior wasn’t 
used to this kind of applause.

That’s because Wilcox had 

just surrendered his fifth goal in 
16 shots in an eventual 7-5 loss 
at Michigan on Jan. 10, and was 
being pulled for the first time in 
his career. As the reigning Big 
Ten Player of the Year skated 
off the ice, the cheers from the 
student section only grew louder.

The 
section, 
commonly 

referred to as the “Children of 
Yost,” has developed a reputation 
as the nation’s rowdiest, smartest 
and — most importantly — 
effective fans in college hockey.

After dropping four of five 

games on the road and falling 
out of the NCAA Tournament 
picture, the No. 17 Michigan 
hockey team needed all of the 
above from its fans on Sunday 
against Ohio State. The team got 
its wish, returning home for the 
first time in over six weeks and 
cruising to a 5-2 win.

Leading the charge from the 

stands in both games was Marcus 
Brown, a senior in an off-yellow 
mesh jersey in the third row. 
Brown fondly remembers sending 
Wilcox off, saying it was a prime 
example of what the student 
section was all about.

“We knew he was one of the 

best goalies out there,” Brown 
said. “We knew he had had one of 
his worst games, and we felt like 
we were a part of that. So we kept 
it going even after play resumed.”

After the win over Minnesota, 

the Wolverines embarked on an 
eight-game road trip. Michigan 
went 4-4 in the stretch, bringing 
its record away from Yost to 7-9. 
Needless to say, the team was 

happy to return to the arena in 
which it is 10-2 and averaging 
nearly 4.5 goals per game.

“I think it impacted our 

record,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson of the road trip. “It was 
so good to be back (Sunday). It 
was wall-to-wall, fans were all in, 
you never know what you’re going 
to get at five o’clock on a Sunday, 
but our fans really showed up.

“This is such a special place, 

and it’s such a home-ice feeling 
that we haven’t had in a long 
time.”

Every team has fans and an 

arena to call home, so what makes 
Yost special? To the team, it’s an 
unnerving passion for not just the 
team, but the game itself.

“They’re not just a bunch 

of rowdy students,” Berenson 
said. “They know the game and 
what’s going on, and they’re huge 
supporters of what we do.”

Added junior forward Justin 

Selman: “It can be one o’clock on a 
Wednesday afternoon or Sunday 

night, the Children of Yost show 
up no matter what. Playing at a 
bunch of rinks across the country 
now, it’s by far the best student 
section. The cheers they have 
and the way they get up for every 
game is just really special.”

For Brown, that has always 

been the easy part. Growing up 
around hockey and still sporting 
the same off-maize mesh jersey 
from a Michigan hockey camp 
10 years ago, Brown had no 
hesitation getting hockey season 
tickets his freshman year. When 
he arrived to his first game, he 
learned he wasn’t alone.

“The big difference between 

Yost and other sections is the 
legacy here,” he said. “A lot of us 
grew up around the program or 
grew up loving hockey, and those 
who don’t catch on quickly to be 
a part of it.

“It’s not the popular sport to go 

to, but people really, really want 
to be there.”

For 
the 
students, 
passion 

was the easy part. The hard 
part was utilizing that passion 
without making the experience 
detrimental to others. Though 
this year has been incident-free, 
that hasn’t always been the case.

“There 
have 
been 
times 

when (Berenson) came out at 
intermission and asked us if our 
parents knew the things we were 
saying,” Brown said. “There’s 
a line, but we walk that line 
proudly.”

The line forces Brown and 

company to get creative. Online 
forums and groups encourage 
suggestions and new ideas, and 
sometimes they stick.

Since 
November, 
opposing 

hockey players have been greeted 
to large printouts of their Tinder 
bios, adding a more personal 
touch to the welcome. What 
began as an accidental finding on 
the popular phone dating app by a 
few fans quickly opened doors to 
a whole new realm of trash talk.

“The Tinder tradition was 

totally 
unexpected,” 
said 

sophomore Anna Moshkovych, 
one of the original sources of the 
idea. “After posting screenshots 
in the Facebook page, the whole 
thing took on a life of its own. One 
alumni offered to get the pictures 
blown up on a poster in Kinkos, 
but it was only a few hours prior 
to puck drop and I didn’t think 
they’d actually follow through. 
Once I showed up to the game 
and saw the physical posters in 
all their glory, I was practically 
crying from laughing so hard.

“The pick-up lines those guys 

put on their profiles gave us a 
whole new level of debauchery. 
We made sure to make the 
experience completely mortifying 
— calling out parents and waving 
the posters up against the glass. 
The game was one for the books.”

With fans cracking up, players 

peeking to see themselves and 
visiting parents lowering their 
heads in shame, the idea was a hit. 
The Tinder posters were alive and 

well Sunday against Ohio State, 
as were a number of cheers both 
new and old. Some made sense. 
Some — like chanting for an adult 
fan to hold a baby up to replicate 
the Lion King scene — did not.

However, 
the 
fun-loving 

nature of the section, according 
to Brown, allows the group to 
continue to keep things fresh.

“Most of the stuff we do in the 

student section is directly for 
supporting the team and heckling 
away players,” Brown said. “But 
occasionally we’ll do things that 
are more for our entertainment, 
not worrying if the other team 
can hear us, but just to crack a 
joke.

“The funny thing is that 

sometimes it catches on, and 
suddenly we have a new cheer.”

With the team no longer in 

the driver’s seat en route to 
the NCAA Tournament, the 
Wolverines will need to play their 
best hockey in the final six games 
to stay in contention. Similarly, 
the Children of Yost are feeling 
the pressure.

“We know we have to bring 

it for the big games,” Brown 
said. “They don’t lose at home 
very much, and we think we’re 
a big part of that, so we feel the 
urgency just like the team does.”

There’s no real way to prove 

just how important the student 
section is to the team’s success. 
But after playing and coaching all 
over the continent, Berenson feels 
that together, special things are 
always on the horizon.

“It’s the sound, the students, 

the band, the sightlines, the other 
team can get that uneasy feeling,” 
he said. “Our team gets this 
confidence that’s really special, 
and all of a sudden, you’re better 
than you were last week because 
you’re at home.

“I can tell you, we wouldn’t 

be the same team or program 
without our student section.”

Neither 
would 
opposing 

goaltenders.
