On the Aug. 4 primary election 
ballot, voters will decide on five 
seats on the Ann Arbor City 
Council. With one seat open in 
each ward and 13 total candidates 
running, The Daily has put 
together a City Council election 
guide with each candidate’s 
platforms to help Ann Arbor 
voters make informed decisions 
at the polls.
Ward 1
Anne Bannister (D), incumbent
Bannister was first elected to 
City Council in 2017 and is seeking 
a second term on the council. She 
grew up and went to school in 
Ann Arbor and graduated with 
a degree in psychology from 
the University of Michigan in 
1986. She is a Certified Financial 
Planner and has worked for the 
Teachers Insurance and Annuity 
Association of America for 10 
years.
Bannister often voted against 
new housing developments in 
Ann Arbor during her time on the 
council, citing density and zoning 
concerns. She supported A2Zero, 
the recent initiative to help Ann 
Arbor go carbon neutral by 2030. 
Bannister 
also 
supports 
the 

Independent Community Police 
Oversight 
Commission 
and 
community policing techniques.
Lisa Disch (D)
Disch is a professor in the 
political science and women’s 
studies 
departments 
at 
the 
University. She has lived in 
Ward 1 since 2008 and is a part 
of Voters Not Politicians, an 
initiative to end gerrymandering 
in Michigan, in 2018. According 
to her website, she is a “life-long 
Democrat.”
Affordable housing, safety and 
environmental sustainability are 
at the top of Disch’s platform. 
She 
supports 
funding 
the 
development 
of 
affordable 
housing 
and 
has 
proposed 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
Renters’ 
Commission. 
Additionally, 
Disch wants to implement more 
sustainable practices city-wide 
and 
strengthen 
community 
oversight of policing in Ann 
Arbor.
Ward 2
Jane Lumm (D), incumbent
Lumm was previously on the 
council as a Republican from 
1993 to 1998. She has served as 
a representative of Ward 2 as 
an Independent since 2011 and 
announced her decision to run as 
a Democrat in April. 
During Lumm’s tenure on City 
Council, she has consistently 

voted against new development 
in Ann Arbor, as well as against 
increased spending and taxes. 
Lumm, along with Ali Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 5, is a City Council 
liaison 
to 
the 
Independent 
Community 
Police 
Oversight 
Commission. 
She 
supports 
fiscal responsibility, as well as 
prioritizing spending on essential 
services and infrastructure. 
Linh Song (D)
Song is in her second term 
as president of the Ann Arbor 
District 
Library 
Board 
of 
Trustees. 
She 
has 
lived 
in 
Ann Arbor for 21 years and 
graduated from the University 
with a degree in political science 
and later obtained her Master 
of Social Work in policy and 
evaluation. Song has worked in 
the nonprofit sector doing anti-
trafficking work and serves on 
the board of directors for both 
Avalon, an affordable housing 
organization, and the Ann Arbor 
Area Community Foundation. 
In 
her 
platform, 
Song 
discusses city services, good 
governance 
and 
community. 
She supports improving public 
bus routes and other forms of 
public transportation, promoting 
engagement

2020 City Council election guide

With just over a month left before 
school starts for the Ann Arbor Public 
School district on Sept. 8, the AAPS 
Board of Education met Wednesday 
evening to discuss instruction plans 
for 
this 
upcoming 
school 
year, 
particularly 
with 
the 
Reimagine 
Learning plan.
The board meeting opened up with 
public commentary, and many AAPS 
parents and faculty raised concerns 
with changes to scheduling, resources 
for student mental health, details on 
attendance and safety measures.
Jeanice Swift, superintendent of 
Ann Arbor Public Schools, began the 
presentation with an update to the 
AAPS food distribution program. She 
detailed the decisions going into the 
fall semester with an emphasis on 
understanding the range of challenges 
students and their families are facing.
“We understand that our students 
have experienced trauma or have 
family that have experienced trauma, 
and we’re going to keep these things 
in mind as we put together the plan,” 
Swift said.
An 
important 
part 
of 
this 
discussion, Swift added, is considering 
the impact of the dense college 
student population returning to Ann 
Arbor. While Swift emphasized the 
pride in living in a college town with 
the University of Michigan, she said 
it is crucial to consider the reality 
of potentially inviting over 40,000 
students from across the world.

The University of Michigan 
announced its hybrid plan for the 
fall semester in late June, allowing 
dorms to reopen and remaining 
flexible to students who do not want 
to return to campus. However, com-
munity members have raised ques-
tions about off-campus housing and 
what students are able to do about 
leases if they do not plan to return 
to campus in the fall. 
Oxford 
Companies 
Associate 
Director Katie Vohwinkle told The 
Daily in an interview that they are 
working with students who signed 
a lease, but decided to not return to 
campus amid COVID-19.
“We have been in touch with the 
property owners, and every situa-
tion is a little bit different. But any-
one that has come to us so far and 
expressed a need to get out of their 
lease, we are assisting them and 
trying to help them find someone 
to take over their lease,” Vohwin-
kle said. “In years past, there have 
been fees associated with that, us 
marketing for them, but we (are) not 
charging (now) and we have been 
very successful in finding people to 
take over leases, (but) they are still 
responsible for the lease.” 
Many 
universities, 
including 
Harvard University and the Cal-
ifornia State University system, 
have announced plans to go entirely 
remote for the fall semester. Voh-
winkle said if the University were 
to follow suit, they would have a 
different approach to the decision 
about their leases. 
“We would look at the situation 
differently if that were to happen,” 
Vohwinkle said. “We would reach 
out to the individual owner about 
how to handle each individual prop-
erty. But, they all do have leases 
(and) so far, we have been fortunate 
and we have been able to help every 
single person in that situation. We 
do not have a clause in our leases to 
break the lease… The students are 
on a 12-month lease, these are not 
academically driven (schedules).” 
LSA junior Avaneesh Reddy told 

The Daily in an email he signed a 
lease last December and is strug-
gling to find a way to release his 
commitment to living in the apart-
ment due to the pandemic. 
“I signed my lease back in 
December at Landmark, as apart-
ments were pretty much running 
out for next year,” Reddy said. “It 
seems like there’s no way to break 
the lease. I’ve spoken to the manage-
ment and explained the situation 
that I shall not be returning to cam-
pus during the next semester, but 
they were pretty nonchalant and 
dismissive of the financial strain 
that it might put to continue hold-
ing such unoccupied space for most 
families.” 
As an international student, 
Reddy said that the subletting pro-
cess is complicated and these road-
blocks have made a challenging 
situation more difficult to navigate 
since it is harder for him to return 
to the U.S.
“Landmark has made things 
worse by preventing subleasing and 
only allowing reletting of the entire 
lease,” Reddy said. “Since almost no 
one is looking to take up a 12 month 
lease now, it seems I have no legal 
way to sublease my apartment. As 
an international student who trav-
elled back to India due to the pan-
demic, I can say with confidence 
that I’ll be staying back and com-
pleting the semester online. I’m also 
considering taking a gap semester, 
but there’s a lot to be considered, 
and having a huge housing debt is 
not making things easier.”
Landmark declined to comment 
on their leasing and reletting poli-
cies. The Daily also reached out to 
Arbor Blu, The Hub - Ann Arbor, 
Zaragon West, Zaragon Place and 
University Towers, all of which 
declined to comment.
LSA junior Deedy Chang talked 
to The Daily about her experience 
working to sublease her room in a 
house for the upcoming school year. 
“I am currently trying to find 
someone to take over my lease. If 
it doesn’t work I’ll probably switch 
to subletting,” Chang said. “I con-
tacted my landlord when I found 
out that I might not return to cam-
pus or I might want to look for a 
space with less people because I live 
in a house of seven.”

Scattered on the front steps of 
the federal building in downtown 
Ann Arbor, approximately 200 
Michigan residents of all ages 
and races gathered on Saturday 
afternoon to protest against racial 
injustice and the prospect of 
federal officers entering Detroit. 
Protesters across the country 
have 
marched 
for 
months 
hoping to end police brutality 
and dismantle systemic racism. 
However, 
Saturday’s 
protest 
in Ann Arbor took on another 
cause after President Donald 
Trump ordered federal officers to 
Portland, Ore., to quell protests, 
raising questions about whether 
the U.S. government has exceeded 
its authority and violated civil 
rights. 
In late June, Trump signed an 
executive order to justify sending 
federal officers to Portland in 
order to protect federal property 
from destruction. Portland, a city 
known for its spirited activism, 
has grown to become an epicenter 
for protests in the wake of George 
Floyd’s death at the hands of 
police brutality. 
The tense standoff in the 
Portland has not just involved 
protesters 
and 
the 
federal 

officers, as local officials have 
also said the situation amounts to 
federal overreach. Furthermore, 
federal officers have deployed 
tear gas into a crowd of Portland 
protesters, 
including 
Portland 
Mayor Ted Wheeler, in late July. 
Trump 
has 
since 
doubled 
down and committed to sending 
more federal officers to cities 
like Chicago, New York City, 
Philadelphia and Detroit, among 
others. 
These recent events were at 
the forefront of the Ann Arbor 
protesters’ activism Saturday.
The 
event, 
organized 
by 
Jeff Gaynor, Ann Arbor School 
Board member, and local tutor 
Amy 
Lesemann 
began 
the 
protest with speeches from local 
activists and politicians including 
candidates 
for 
Washtenaw 
County prosecutor Hugo Mack, 
Arianne Slay, Eli Savit and other 
Washtenaw County officials.
Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor said the U.S. must undergo 
a major transformation to create 
an inclusive community. 
“The federal government, state 
government, local government, 
every community within the 
United States of America requires 
reworking and reimagining to 
meet our goals and aspirations,” 
Taylor said. “(Our goal is) a 
community 
that 
embraces 
everyone, where everyone has a 
role to play, where everyone can 
achieve what it is they wish to 
achieve.”

Protesters fight against 
prospect of federal 
officers entering Detroit

As the pandemic rages 
on, students struggle to 
break housing contracts


The Michigan primary elec-

tion for Michigan’s 12th Con-
gressional District seat in the 
U.S. House of Representatives 
is on Aug. 4. Solomon Rajput, 
a current medical student at 
the University of Michigan, 
is taking a leave of absence 
to run for Congress and chal-
lenging incumbent U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who 
has served three terms as the 
representative from the 12th 
district. The Dingell family 
has represented the district for 
the past 87 years –– Dingell 
was preceded by her husband 
John Dingell Jr. and his father 
John Dingell Sr. Candidate Jeff 
Jones is running uncontested 
in the Republican primary for 
the 12th district. 

The 
Washtenaw 
County 

Democratic 
Party 
recently 

hosted a debate for Rajput and 
Dingell where they discussed 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
economy and the environment. 
Last week, The Daily met with 
both Democratic candidates to 
discuss their experience, main 
policy issues, campaign strate-
gies and the importance of vot-
ing in the upcoming election 
before the primary. 

Medicare 
for 
All 
and 

Healthcare

Though both candidates sup-

port Medicare for All, Dingell 
cited universal healthcare as 
her top issue going into a new 
Congress in 2021 and was a lead 
sponsor of the Medicare for All 
Act in 2019. 

“The 
number 
one 
issue 

that I am going to get done 
is Medicare for All,” Dingell 
said. “I think every person in 
this country has a right, when 
they’re sick, to be able to go 
to the doctor (and) not have 
to think about (being) able to 

afford the treatment that they 
need. I have always felt this 
way but having been a care-
giver for five years, and seeing 
this (first-hand), I know I’m 
luckier than many and the days 
that I was desperate, I couldn’t 
navigate the system. I couldn’t 
make it work.” 

Rajput spoke on the current 

healthcare system’s need for 
reform, calling it a “dystopia,” 
and told The Daily that his 
campaign supports Medicare 
for All systems. 

“We are ardently support-

ing a Medicare for All system, 
single-payer health care system 
that would guarantee health 
care for all people in this coun-
try, because right now, our 
system could not be more dys-
functional,” Rajput said. “Our 
health care system is kind of 
the health care system you’d 
find in a dystopia.”

Rajput also said Medicare for 

All is more necessary than ever 
amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

“(People are) not only wor-

ried about getting the virus,” 
Rajput said. “They’re also wor-
ried about losing (their) job and 
losing their health care, and 
then not being able to get treat-
ment for the virus because they 
no longer have health care. So 
still, (a) Medicare for All sys-
tems is something that we’re 
really fighting for.”

Rajput said his experience as 

a medical student gives him a 
unique, first-hand understand-
ing of health care issues. 

“We go see patients (and) we 

try to figure out what’s going 
on with them,” Rajput said. “So 
often, we have to tell patients 
we know exactly what’s going 
on with you and we got the per-
fect thing for you, but we can’t 
give it to you because your 
health insurance doesn’t cover 
it. And it’s some pretty sad, 
heartbreaking stuff.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

The University of Michigan 

COVID-19 Campus Challenge, an 
initiative organized through the 
College of Engineering aimed to 
support and showcase student 
ideas for changes to be made on 
campus during the pandemic, 
hosted a virtual showcase on July 
1. Teams presented their propos-
als in project categories includ-
ing food insecurity, Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion, co-cur-
ricular activities, mental health, 
housing and transportation. Sev-
eral projects from each category 
were designated as finalists. 

Business sophomore Achintya 

Saxena participated in the food 
insecurity category and pro-
posed improvements to the exist-
ing infrastructure of the Maize 
and Blue Cupboard. His team’s 
project was titled “Maize and 
Blue Cupboard 2.0.” The project 
included a scheduling system 
to keep students and MBC staff 
safe while connecting with local 
farmers, distributing easy and 
healthy recipes and increasing 
community engagement with the 
Cupboard in the long-run. 

Saxena said he believes food 

insecurity grows with increas-
ing economic problems, so health 
concerns and budget restrictions 
for some students may hinder 
them from getting the food they 
need. 

“Because of COVID, people 

aren’t able to go to the Maize and 
Blue Cupboard because they may 
not be on the Michigan campus 
or if they are on campus they may 
be afraid to go to a public space,” 
Saxena said. 

One of the most enjoyable 

parts of the challenge for Saxena 
was the collaborative nature of 
the development process

“It was kind of different than 

some of the other case competi-
tions I’ve done before in that it 
fostered a much more collabora-
tive environment where you were 
given a lot of mentors and staff 
who you could reach out to and 
ask questions,” Saxena said. “For 
example, for food insecurity we 
had a meeting with MDining staff 
and we were also able to schedule 
one-on-one meetings with the 
associate dean of students as well 
as the director of the Maize and 
Blue Cupboard. That exposure 
was really good because it gave 
us a lot of access to information 
we wouldn’t normally be able to 
come across as students.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Manasi Sridhar and LSA junior 
Meredith Ainsworth created a 

project aimed at battling social 
isolation on campus during the 
fall semester. The project incor-
porates a survey — called the 
UMich Pal Pact — and a matching 
algorithm designed to help stu-
dents connect with someone new 
and expand their social support 
network. Ainsworth explained 
how the makeup of the Univer-
sity’s smaller colleges and units 
coupled with the public-health 
informed fall semester can make 
campus a very isolating place for 
some students.

“I think it is more important 

than ever to bring people togeth-
er and try to make sure that 
people are not feeling lonely and 
able to advocate for themselves 
in terms of mental health,” Ain-
sworth said. 

Additionally, their team hoped 

to coordinate more virtual and 
in-person mental health wellness 
events. According to Sridhar, the 
problem with mental health ser-
vices on campus is not the lack 
of them, but rather the lack of 
accessibility to them. 

Sridhar, Ainsworth and their 

other team members have decid-
ed to continue on with their 
project regardless of if they are 
contacted by the University’s 
administration, as they believe it 
will positively benefit students.

A

s I write this article from my 
home in Miami, Fla., my state’s 
COVID-19 rates continue to 
peak at tens of thousands of new cases 
per day. An article from The Guardian 
described the magnitude of the Sunshine 
State’s crisis as such: “If Florida was a 
country, it would be one of the world’s 
biggest hotspots.” Nonetheless, Florida 
Gov. Ron DeSantis has adopted an opti-
mistic, yet somewhat dismissive outlook 
on the growth in cases. In June, DeSan-
tis chose to veto an increase in health 
care spending from the state’s budget. 
More recently, while advising Floridians 
to be cautious but not fearful, DeSantis 
quipped, “I think fear is our enemy here.” 
DeSantis has been criticized for his 
lackluster response to the pandemic — 
and rightly so. In spite of expert medical 
advice, DeSantis has pushed to reopen 
the state’s businesses, its schools and even 
Disney World as soon as possible. His 
eagerness to open back up has been criti-
cized by many as prioritizing economic 
gain over protecting vulnerable lives, 
but it’s also been criticized for its defer-
ence to President Donald Trump. Many 
local, state and international leaders have 
expressed concern with the commander-
in-chief’s statements and policy regard-
ing COVID-19. The Red Cross even 
spoke out against the U.S.’s response, 
deeming it divisive and ineffective. 
In Brazil, however, Trump’s bombastic 
rhetoric may have found a receptive audi-
ence, especially within the Latin Ameri-
can country’s own executive branch, 
based on the leaders’ similar responses 
to the pandemic. In April, Brazil Presi-
dent Jair Bolsonaro had responded with 
a shrug when reporters pressed him 
about Brazil’s record number of deaths. 

“So what?” said the president of the larg-
est and most populous country in Latin 
America. He continued dismissively, “I’m 
sorry. What do you want me to do?”
It is unlikely there is any single expla-
nation for the drastic rates of infection and 
death in the U.S. and Brazil. Americans 
and Brazilians are not inherently sick-
lier or weaker than the rest of the world. 
While some structural factors — geogra-
phy, public health resources and even the 
weather — can make disease spread more 
likely in any given country, the impact of 
irresponsible and reckless leadership 
on transmission is pronounced. To 
that extent, Brazil and the U.S. cer-
tainly have many geographic, struc-
tural and climatic differences but do 
share one eerie commonality: a lack of 
effective, responsible leadership. 
I am often hesitant to assign too much 
theoretical power to any particular poli-
tician because government is inherently 
complicated and a single person is rarely 
the only one responsible for a larger phe-
nomenon or problem. But the reality is 
that Bolsonaro and Trump do wield an 
incredible amount of persuasive power 
over some of their constituents. Many 
people do make decisions based on what 
their country’s leaders say, even if what’s 
being said is misleading or simply untrue. 
As Brazilian media has reported, 
every time that Bolsonaro downplays the 
coronavirus on television, his supporters’ 
adherence to social distancing declines. 
Likewise, to say that Trump has also 
been dismissive of COVID-19’s spread 
throughout America would be an under-
statement. Despite the massive scale 
of the outbreak that is raging through 
major metropolitan centers throughout 
the U.S., the decision to wear a mask 

appears increasingly political. As the 
U.S. handles tens of thousands of new 
cases a day, the White House is planning 
to block funding for test-and-trace funds 
and other prevention measures. On July 
19, Trump insisted in an interview on 
“Fox News on Sunday” that the corona-
virus would eventually “disappear.” 
Both countries’ leaders have publicly 
minimized the pandemic. That matters. 
A politician’s ineffective leadership can 
affect the behavior of fervent support-
ers and casual observers alike as well as 
make the difference between a minor 
dip or a spike in cases. In the wake of 
misinformation and new data around 
COVID-19’s transmission and fatality 
rates, this much is likely true for the U.S. 
and Brazil: It’s going to get a lot worse 
before it gets better. That’s something 
we know based on scientific expertise 
and thoughtful analysis of public health 
outcomes from professionals who are 
trained to assess risk to vulnerable 
populations. Brazilians and Americans 
alike should continue to practice social 
distancing, wear a mask and encourage 
others who are reluctant to do the same. 
Fear is not the enemy. Carelessness 
is the enemy. The willingness to sac-
rifice lives for economic and political 
gain is the enemy. Reckless behavior 
and misinformation serve as powerful 
vectors for disease. When Gov. DeSan-
tis opens the public beaches — which 
he will, sooner rather than later — we 
should not take that to mean COVID-19 
no longer poses a serious public health 
concern. Instead, we should acknowl-
edge it means the very opposite.

The real enemy

O

ur nation’s military bases 
should serve as a reminder 
of the courage and bravery 
of our country’s armed forces, not 
as monuments to men who fought 
to tear the United States apart. It is 
time the U.S. government remove 
the names of Confederate generals 
from our military bases. 
Some of the nation’s largest and 
most well known military bases, 
such as Fort Hood in Texas, Fort 
Bragg in North Carolina and Fort 
Benning in Georgia are named 
after Confederate generals. In 
total, there are ten major army 
bases named after Confederate 
generals. The recent Black Lives 
Matter 
protests 
and 
growing 
national conversation about racial 
justice have put this issue back in 
the spotlight and reignited calls 
for the bases to be renamed. 
Support for the name change has 
been channeled into action with 
lawmakers adding a provision to 
the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act requiring that all Con-
federate names be removed from 
U.S. military bases. A version of 
each bill passed the House and the 
Senate, however, the removal of 
names is not yet set in stone. 
President Donald Trump has 
vowed to veto the bill if it includes 
a stipulation to rename bases. The 
House and Senate passed the bills 
by a veto-proof majority of over 
two-thirds in each house. How-
ever, if the president decides to 
veto the bill, Republicans in the 
Senate could switch their votes 
to prove their loyalty to Trump. 
Additionally, since the versions 
of the NDAA passed by the House 
and Senate were different, the 
two chambers must negotiate a 
final version to vote on, which 
might not include a requirement 
to rename the bases. Sen. Jim 
Inhofe, R-Okla., a conservative 
Trump supporter who has a great 
deal of negotiating power as Sen-
ate Armed Services Chair, has 
vowed to fight to remove this pro-
vision from the final bill. 
It is simply unacceptable that 
in 2020 we are still having this 
debate. We should not have our 
military bases serving as monu-
ments to men who actively fought 
against the U.S. Army and were 
willing to tear our country apart 
in order to hold onto their slaves. 
Instead, we should rename our 
bases after true American heroes 
who better represent our values. 
Currently, there are no U.S. mili-
tary bases named after women, 
despite the important role that 
countless women have played in 

various wars. There are so many 
people to choose from, both male 
and female, who deserve the honor 
of having a base named after them, 
whether it be Harriet Tubman, 
John McCain, Ulysses S. Grant or 
other deserving individuals for 
whom the bases can be named. 
Trump and some of his supporters 
have opposed renaming the bases, 
saying it is giving in to cancel cul-
ture and promoting a revision of 
history. They also argue changing 
the names takes away the honor of 
these bases, which have been criti-
cal to past U.S. military success. 
President Trump reiterated this 
claim in a Fox News interview, 
saying “We won two world wars, 
two world wars, beautiful world 
wars that were vicious and hor-
rible, and we won them out of 
Fort Bragg, we won out of all of 
these forts that now they want to 
throw those names away.” 
Arguments such as these cheap-
en the hard work and dedication 
of those who served in the World 
Wars and other military conflicts. 
The successes that have come out of 
these bases have nothing to do with 
their names — it has to do with the 
courageous men and women who 
serve there. By making this argu-
ment, the president is demeaning 
their commitment and sacrifice. 
Our president should be focused 
on commemorating the legacy of 
true American heroes and patri-
ots, not Confederate generals.
The whole argument of keeping up 
Confederate memorials to remember 
our history is ludicrous statues and 
namesakes do not serve as a reminder 
of history — they serve as symbols 
of white supremacy. We should not 
honor Confederate generals who 
fought to protect their right to own 
other people and tried to tear our 
nation apart. 
Countries such as Germany have 
shown us that you do not need statues 
or monuments to remember history. 
In Germany, there are no Nazi flags, 
no statues to Hitler or elementary 
schools named after Mengele. They 
recognize their sinful history and 
work to atone; they do not commemo-
rate the monsters of the past. 
Removing the names of Confederate 
generals from our military bases will 
not fix everything. It is a small step in 
the marathon of changes that we need 
to make in this country. However, it is 
an important step that must be taken 
to ensure that we commemorate the 
values and individuals who repre-
sent our highest American ideals. 

Rename the bases

A

s a student at the University of 
Michigan over the past year, I 
have come to love the natural 
beauty of the Ann Arbor region, whether 
it be the scenic Huron River winding 
through the Washtenaw County coun-
tryside, large expanses of open space 
or picturesque farms dotting the land-
scape. Unlike many other cities similar 
in size — along with most areas of Metro 
Detroit — Ann Arbor’s close proximity 
to the countryside in nearly all direc-
tions makes this city a rarity in south-
eastern Michigan. In only a couple 
of miles, you can easily travel from 
a dense, urban atmosphere to wide, 
open fields that give you a longing for 
Northern Michigan’s landscape, only a 
half hour from Metro Detroit.
These precious lands surrounding 
Ann Arbor don’t exist today by accident. 
For nearly two decades, the city of Ann 
Arbor has led a valuable effort aimed 
at preserving the “Greenbelt” around 
the city limits in order to protect natu-
ral resources, the Huron River water-
shed and farmland. This effort began 
in November 2003, when Ann Arbor 
voters approved the Open Space and 
Parkland Preservation Millage, also 
known as the Greenbelt Millage. 
Since then, Ann Arbor has protected 
over 6,100 acres of land within the 
boundaries of the Greenbelt Dis-
trict, in partnership with Washtenaw 
County and surrounding townships.
Far beyond simply preserving the 
rural character of the Ann Arbor region 
for decades to come, the Greenbelt Mill-
age — which is a 30-year, 0.5 mil tax levy 
based on assessed value — has a wide 
range of benefits, as Remy Long, man-
ager of the Greenbelt Program for the 
city of Ann Arbor, discusses in a video 
posted on the Ann Arbor website. 
According to Long, “dollars and 
acres” are only one way to understand 
the far-reaching benefits of the Green-
belt effort. By preserving dozens of 
farms, one of the most powerful impacts 
of the Greenbelt is increased food securi-
ty and a greater supply of locally-grown 
produce for residents in and around Ann 
Arbor to enjoy. The Greenbelt program, 
as Long explains, also makes it easier 
for new farmers to purchase land by 
removing the development rights, which 
lowers the land value and makes it more 
affordable. “Affordable land access is the 
number one barrier to starting a success-
ful farm operation,” Long explains. “If 
we’ve removed those development 
rights from the equation and made it 
more affordable for beginning farm-
ers to access, we are helping pro-
mote a new generation of farmers.” 
In the nearly two decades that have 
passed since Ann Arbor residents 
approved the Greenbelt Millage, thou-

sands of acres of farmland and natural 
areas have been successfully protected. 
According to an MLive report from 2014, 
the largest property preserved by the 
program is a 286-acre property in Ann 
Arbor Township, north of Ann Arbor. 
Taking second and third place are cur-
rently a 265-acre property in Webster 
Township and a 218-acre property in 
Salem Township, respectively. In the 
first 15 years of the Greenbelt Program, 
more than 5,700 acres of wooded 
areas, wetland, prairie and farmland 
have been permanently preserved. 
Many community members and offi-
cials agree that the Greenbelt program 
is so important because it protects the 
natural, undeveloped areas surrounding 
Ann Arbor from urban sprawl. Urban 
sprawl leads to a number of problems, 
according to Encyclopedia Britannica, 
including “increased energy use, pol-
lution, and traffic congestion and a 
decline in community distinctiveness 
and cohesiveness.” Without the Green-
belt initiative, many feel that the areas 
of Washtenaw County surrounding Ann 
Arbor would begin to look more like the 
suburbs of Metro Detroit, with miles of 
never-ending strip malls and subdivi-
sions. As a result of the millage, “So much 
beautiful property has been protected, 
and there’s also funding to protect more, 
so Washtenaw County is never going to 
turn into Oakland County. There’s going 
to be viable agriculture and there’s 
going to be close-by natural areas for 
people to enjoy,” according to Dan Eze-
kiel, former chairman of Ann Arbor’s 
Greenbelt Advisory Commission.
While a majority of voters approved 
the Greenbelt Millage in 2003 and the 
program has proven to show clear ben-
efits for the Ann Arbor community, the 
Greenbelt does have critics. One common 
concern amongst residents is that the 
Greenbelt isn’t the best use of the tax rev-
enue the city of Ann Arbor takes in, espe-
cially since most of the Greenbelt District 
is outside of the city limits. While I am not 
a taxpayer in Ann Arbor and I understand 
these concerns, I believe that the benefits 
of this program for the entire Ann Arbor 
region as a whole far outweigh the costs. 
Not only does the Greenbelt safeguard 
natural resources and improve food secu-
rity, but by protecting natural beauty and 
open areas, I feel this program is also 
beneficial for things like mental health. 
According to research discussed by Har-
vard University, there is “a strong con-
nection between time spent in nature and 
reduced stress, anxiety, and depression.”

“

If you can sit down with a fam-
ily and see your own family in 
them … then you’re going to 
work hard for them.” — Barack Obama
With arch-conservative and beer 
rights 
activist 
Brett 
Kavanaugh 
replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy, 
this Supreme Court term appeared 
bleak at best for liberals. LGBTQ+ 
rights, DACA, Trump’s taxes, reli-
gious freedom, abortion, Affordable 
Care Act and gun control were all on 
the docket this term, so most liberals’ 
expectations ranged from dismal to 
apocalyptic. However, the crisis was 
averted, for now, as the four Demo-
cratic appointees found an unlikely 
ally in many cases: the umpire him-
self, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. 
This term, Roberts sided with the 
liberal justices on an array of cases 
ranging from one opposing the admin-
istration’s cavalier behavior with dis-
mantling the DACA program to one 
protecting a woman’s right to choose 
— for now. However, a deeper look into 
this surprising term exposes a startling 
and revelatory look into the philosophy 
of Roberts and his political games-
manship. See, while Roberts has been 
reviled by conservatives as a “secret 
liberal” and praised by liberals as an 
“institutionalist,” this public persona 
is a façade to cover partisanship by 
manipulating the odd relationship the 
Supreme Court has with media, the 
public and his own colleagues, and 
we cannot allow him to fool us.
Famously, when describing his judi-
cial philosophy during his confirma-
tion hearings, analogizing judges to 
baseball umpires, Roberts said, “It’s my 
job to call balls and strikes, and not to 
pitch or bat.” This bought him the sup-
port of 78 out of 100 senators, with nays 
on Roberts’ confirmation belonging to 
then-Senators Barack Obama, D-Ill., 
Joe Biden, D-Del., and Ted Kennedy, 
D-Mass., along with 19 other votes. 
Once Roberts replaced his old 
boss — noted segregationist Wil-
liam Rehnquist — as Chief Justice, he 
attempted to maintain a low profile, 
developing close relationships with his 
colleagues and cultivating a reputation 
for warmth, wit and good humor. This 
reputation for congeniality made Rob-
erts a darling of the media, which lent 
the chief both credibility and goodwill. 
However, the trait the media did not 
give Roberts enough credit for was 
his savvy. See, one of the main pow-
ers of the chief justice is to assign the 
majority opinions if he or she is on the 
winning side, so Roberts has sought to 
deflect the media criticism onto other 
justices in major rulings like D.C. v. 
Heller (2008), which held that the 
second amendment guarantees the 

right to firearms. While the case 
drew the ire of the left, most was 
directed toward Antonin Scalia — 
who I would normally make a joke 
about, but it’s just too easy.
As Roberts became more expe-
rienced, he began employing more 
overtly political tactics. For example, 
in National Federation of Independent 
Business v. Sebellius (2012), Roberts 
had the opportunity to deal a death-
blow to Obamacare, but he sided with 
liberals, concluding that the law’s 
controversial 
individual 
mandate 
was constitutional, which became 
the headline. However, the decision’s 
arguably more consequential prec-
edent was his conclusion that the 
law’s mandatory Medicaid expansion 
was unconstitutional, which deprived 
millions of people across the country, 
especially in red states, of access to 
health care. Further, the logic of his 
precedent could be applied to many 
liberal priorities at the federal level in 
the future concerning everything from 
clean energy to free college.
While Roberts’ media manipula-
tion and political savvy are signifi-
cant, they are usually overcome by 
two things: religion and racism. These 
are weak spots in Roberts’ arsenal, as, 
since he is a wealthy white Catholic 
man, he has never had to consider the 
issues of race or imposition of religion 
in his daily life, so he simply cannot 
relate. Therefore, he is completely 
tone-deaf to these issues, which has 
never been more apparent than in his 
majority opinion in Shelby County v. 
Holder (2013) — one of the worst deci-
sions in the Supreme Court’s history. 
I could describe the gross incompe-
tence expressed by one of the most 
powerful men in this country, but, 
honestly, his reiteration from a 
2009 opinion does it best: 
“Things have changed in the South. 
Voter turnout and registration rates 
now approach parity. Blatantly dis-
criminatory evasions of federal decrees 
are rare. And minority candidates hold 
office at unprecedented levels.” 
If you don’t speak conservative 
nonsense, I can gladly translate. 
Essentially Roberts is patting 
himself and white people in the 
South on the back saying, “Con-
grats guys, we did it. Racism is 
no more,” which is just about the 
most ridiculous — and statutorily 
illogical — point that I have ever 
read. Needless to say, this deci-
sion, which gutted Sections 4 
and 5 of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965, led to a wave of laws 
targeted at decreasing minority 
voter turnout across the coun-
try, especially in the South.

With the notable exceptions of 
Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which 
legalized gay marriage across the 
country, and Whole Women’s Health 
v. Hellersteadt (2016), which acts to 
maintain protections for a woman’s 
right to choose, the Supreme Court 
tacked conservative in most every con-
sequential case after 2010. While these 
small, steady wins satisfied most legal 
conservatives, the evangelical base 
hungered for further victories. More-
over, many Democrats in the Senate
and on the campaign trail began advo-
cating for altering the structure of the 
Supreme Court. This national cli-
mate set the stage for the term in 
2020 with Roberts, who is a bona
fide conservative, at the center of 
the court and several consequen-
tial cases facing the justices.
This term, Roberts’s cunning was 
on full display in several cases, but the 
pinnacle of his strategic prowess was 
on the issue of LGBTQ+ rights. In Bos-
tock v. Clayton County (2020), despite 
the chief voting against gay rights in 
Obergefell and other previous deci-
sions, he provided his vote to pad the 
6-3 majority. This vote secured the 
ability of conservative Neil Gorsuch 
to write the narrow majority opin-
ion rather than allowing one of the 
court’s liberals to author an expansive 
one. Then, in a much lower profile 
case, Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. 
Morrissey-Berru (2020), Roberts com-
missioned conservative Samuel Alito 
— who spent most of the term writing 
whiny dissents making me question 
his devotion to the rule of law and 
overall sanity — to write the opinion 
allowing LGBTQ+ individuals to be 
fired by religious organizations due 
to the ministerial exception. Thus, 
he and the conservatives dealt a vic-
tory to liberals, but they strategically 
undermined it at every turn, which 
is the same pattern that every liberal 
“win” this term has followed.
This term, Roberts has played 
political games while still making 
time to disenfranchise minority vot-
ers and help reintegrate religion into 
public life. Despite this, many politi-
cal pundits who either lack expertise 
about the court or are too optimistic 
to view objective facts as such believe 
that this term marks a pivotal change 
of heart for Justice Roberts. Spoiler 
alert: It doesn’t. Any analysis scratch-
ing even slightly below the surface 
of these opinions conveys Roberts’ 
true motivation, which is to save face 
for the court at all costs, even if that 
means losing in the short term.

Dear liberals, John Roberts isn’t our friend

Not a month before quarantine started, 
my Taylor Swift™ snake ring snapped in half. 
After anxiously twisting it on and off my finger 
for nearly two years, the silvery metal fittingly 
relented in therapy. Bulky, obnoxious and glit-
tery green — I had come to think of it as a secret 
signal (“I knew you were a Swiftie!”) and a con-
versation starter. “Oh,” I began when anyone 
asked me about it, “I’m a really big Taylor Swift 
fan.”
So it’s hard to overstate the unconscionable 
joy and sheer terror I felt Thursday morning 
when I saw that Taylor’s eighth album, folklore, 
was going to be released in less than 24 hours. 
Pre-album release rituals out the window (lis-
ten to all previous albums in consecutive order, 
wear all possible Taylor merch during release 
week, etc., etc.), all I could do was take a few 
selfies with the sepia-toned folklore™ filter on 
Instagram — and wait. 
To anyone well-versed in Taylor’s meticu-
lous release routine, folklore is an interruption. 
Her lead singles are expected to roll out three 
to four months in advance of each new album, 
which are released every two years in autumn, 
and followed by a year-and-a-half long tour. 
Right on schedule, if it wasn’t for COVID-19, I 
would have been preparing to attend LoverFest 
this week, the accompanying festival to Taylor’s 
2019 effort. 
But more explicitly, folklore is an interrup-
tion full stop. The pastel palette of Lover has 
been washed over with a melancholy gray. Sug-
ary anthemic pop replaced with atmospheric 
strings, piano and acoustic guitar. Taylor has 
always been a poet, but with a subdued back-
drop her lyrics have room to shine. While I’m 
not sure that one of the biggest pop stars in 
the world can, by definition, create something 
“alternative” or “indie,” folklore is certainly the 
closest Taylor’s ever come. With the help of The 
National member, songwriter and producer 

Aaron Dessner, and longtime collaborator Jack 
Antonoff, every song on folklore sounds like it 
could be made into a movie. The drama of love 
and loss is Taylor’s wheelhouse, but she’s never 
addressed these same themes with this kind of 
weight or maturity. 
Take “my tears ricochet” for example. Any 
Swiftie worth their salt knows the significance 
that its placement as “track five” holds — the 
fifth track of any Taylor album is its emotional 
compass. From her self-titled debut to 1989, 
they were the Big Heartbreak Songs. reputation 
broke the mold with the hopeful “Delicate,” 
clueing fans in on the fact that she and her cur-
rent boyfriend were in it for the long-haul. And 
on Lover, “The Archer” gives insight to Taylor’s 
struggle with loving herself. This time around, 
track five invites the listener to a funeral. Poten-
tially Taylor’s. 
“I didn’t have it in myself to go with grace” 
she admits, backed by ghoulish “oohs” and a 
gloomy keyboard, “‘cause when I’d fight you 
used to tell me I was brave.” If this doesn’t 
sound like your typical break-up song, it isn’t. 
When Taylor’s 15-year relationship with her 
former record label executive Scott Borchetta 
fell through last summer, she was crystal clear 
about her feelings toward him and the person 
who now owns her masters, or “stolen lulla-
bies,” Scooter Braun. In a back-and-forth made 
public online, Taylor claimed that Borchetta 
hadn’t allowed her to buy back the rights to 
her original recordings before he sold them to 
Braun, one of her career-long bullies. “my tears 
ricochet” tells the story from a ghost’s perspec-
tive. “If I’m dead to you, why are you at the 
wake?” she wonders while watching her tor-
mentor attend her burial. This kind of creativity 
is threaded throughout folklore, demonstrating 
Taylor’s talent to seamlessly weave fact and fic-
tion.

Ordinary histories

Thirteen years ago, the first episode of 
“Mad Men” aired on AMC. The show’s televi-
sion success was something of a marvel given 
its noticeably slow-paced, character-driven 
story. The legacy of the show’s accurate his-
torical aura has only increased year by year 
as audiences reflect on Don Draper’s (Jon 
Hamm) existential searching. Re-watching 
the seven-season long masterpiece in 2020 
makes us question the proportions by which 
1960s WASP culture dramatically reshaped 
notions of capital-driven success and the 
American Dream. Equally, a second look 
at “Mad Men” during the COVID-19 pan-
demic gives us pause to reflect on how liv-
ing through history can often come across as 
mundane.
“Mad Men” is one of the most delicately 
thought out historical dramas to ever grace 
television. In the twilight years of Mad 
Men’s commercial appeal, numerous copy-
cat productions sought to capitalize on the 
popularity of the 1960s aesthetic. Shows like 
“Pan-Am” and “The Playboy Club” attempted 
to glamorize the Madison Avenue lifestyle by 
replicating the ever-present misogyny that 
had been illustrated by “Mad Men” creator 
Matthew Weiner. What these shows ulti-
mately got wrong was that Mad Men’s enter-
tainment success never rested entirely on 
its nostalgic portrayals of male-dominated 
workplaces. While other producers latched 
onto surface-level images of vintage sexism, 
“Mad Men” slowly unraveled how the per-
vasive cultural ideals of the 1960s were any-
thing but fulfilling. What greatly appealed 
to audiences was the accuracy by which 
“Mad Men” showed regular Americans living 
through extraordinary historical moments in 
ordinary ways.
Throughout “Mad Men” you can often 
trace singular episodes down to a specific 
historical date from on-screen news broad-
casts or newspaper clippings. The story 
arc acts like a time machine - but not in the 
ways you’d expect. The cultural upheaval of 
the 1960s moves slowly from season to sea-
son, just as culture changes in real life. Fur-
niture styles evolve, characters grow long 
hair and mustaches, and end-credit music 
slowly makes its way from Bobby Helms to 
The Beatles. Peggy Olson (Elizabeth Moss, 
“Handmaid’s Tale”) eventually ditches her 
schoolgirl bangs for a fashionable bob. None 
of these changes are ever mentioned out-
right, rather, we see the passage of time and 
mindsets from a forward lens. Rarely do we 
stop to consider how consequential the 1960s 
was for American politics, art, technology 
and life as a whole.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a rare instance 
of universal historical recognition. Most of us 
can safely assume that in the future, political 
dialogues around the pandemic will take the 

shape of similar, recent historical events of 
great magnitude such as Hurricane Katrina 
or 9/11. What we won’t know, just as the 
characters in “Mad Men” don’t, is how asi-
nine our most level-headed reactions might 
seem. 
In season three’s episode “The Grown 
Ups”, John F. Kennedy is assassinated on 
the same day of Roger Sterling’s (John Slat-
tery, “Modern Love”) daughter’s wedding. 
Instead of calling off the reception, the entire 
event still occurs in full formality - albeit 
with many noticeably empty dinner tables. 
Compare this situation to the present day: 
There are those of us who are trying to re-
establish a sense of normalcy by baking bread 
from scratch or writing quarantine diaries at 
home. Others of us choose to go out to bars 
whilst bearing full knowledge of the current 
health risks and death tolls. Is it really that 
hard to believe that not every American was 
in tears on November 22, 1963? Later in the 
episode, following the death of Lee Harvey 
Oswald, Don’s wife, Betty (January Jones, 
“The Last Man on Earth”), says she wants a 
divorce. 
In the Season 7 episode “Waterloo”, the 
nation is gripped in awe by the broadcast of 
Apollo 11’s moon landing. The next day, Don 
receives word of his longtime partner and 
boss’s passing. He has a vision of his boss, 
Bert Cooper (Robert Morse, Broadway’s 
“How to Succeed”) singing “The Best Things 
In Life Are Free”, which leaves Don visibly 
emotional. After this mid-season shake-up, 
the conclusion of Don’s story leads him on a 
rocky journey that ends with him reckoning 
with his past, finally becoming fulfilled and 
possibly creating a timeless advertisement 
for Coca-Cola.
“Mad Men”’s writers suggest that it’s not 
until times of absolute historical importance 
and clarity — the “we will be talking about 
this for decades” moments — that people 
will decide to make sweeping changes in 
their lives. The moments where character 
conflicts, both internal and external, remain 
constant are where the importance of time is 
not as recognizable. Throughout the series, 
the passing of history such as the Civil Rights 
Movement or the Vietnam War is often unno-
ticeable.
The show handles prejudice of the time 
period with a similar degree of historical 
accuracy. Weiner and his writers purpose-
fully didn’t try to make their characters 
exude white saviorship, which is the pitfall 
of so many period pieces. Don Draper and 
other ad men have open dialogues regard-
ing the escalating conflict in Vietnam, and 
openly discuss their criticisms of the Civil 
Rights movement in the office, although not 
for very long.

record of anthems and lullabies, is perfectly 
representative of herself as an artist. The collec-
tion of 12 songs firmly defines her ingenuity as a 
singer-songwriter, encapsulating her chamele-
onic musical aptitude through the ebb and flow 
of a lilting guitar. Even in the most brash and 
declarative moments on the album, La Havas’s 
supreme control and calm when navigating the 
most climactic emotions is an astounding feat. 
In the past, you could have compared her 
to a lot of fellow soulful singer-songwriters, 
but with this release, the musician has pushed 
herself to the highest echelon of creativity. 
Lianne La Havas is the distillation of years in 
the business for the singer, and her dues have 
finally been paid — you can feel her heart in 
each word, reaching out for you to join her in 
a closer look at life, love and all the gray confu-
sion in between. 
In the five years since La Havas’s last full-
length release, Blood, our world has been 
turned upside down and inside out in every 
way imaginable. The singer captures this chaos 
within the bubble of her own experience, creat-
ing a case study in turmoil, emotional and phys-
ical, matched with the incredible beauty of her 
songwriting. Letting the waves of life roll over 
her, La Havas does not shy away from dark-
ness or honesty throughout the record, provid-
ing her listener with a prismatic view of a love 
affair gone sickly-sweet. 
On “Bittersweet,” the brightest point of the 
album, La Havas counters the raspy sensual-
ity of each verse with a euphoric embrace of 
the refrain’s melancholy. “No more hanging 
around,” she sings, and the lilting guitar bursts 
forward into an explosion of percussion, vocals 
reaching new heights. Slower, more introspec-

tive tracks like “Green Papaya” and “Paper 
Thin” add a diary-like quality to the record, 
offering the listener insight into the intimate 
moments of her life. 
Beyond anything else, La Havas’s newest 
material depicts the push and pull of self-doubt 
in striking clarity, whether it is an irresistible 
love in “Can’t Fight” or the flirtatious ques-
tioning of “Read My Mind.” The songwriter’s 
woven melodies and shifting chord structure 
illustrate the slippery slope of love just as well 
as her lyrics, mediating the outside world’s 
frenzy with a spiraling interiority of her own. 
But despite the status of these songs in limbo 
between her brain and a potential audience, La 
Havas still feels grounded in an awareness of 
herself. Even on the brink of losing herself in 
the music, the singer always pulls back to real-
ity, showing us how beautiful it can really be. 
Listening to Lianne La Havas is like taking a 
Magic-School-Bus-style journey into the inner-
most memories of the album’s creator, as snip-
pets of joy and frustration peek through mellow 
soundscapes. She makes everything her own, 
highlighting new facets of covers like Radio-
head’s “Weird Fishes” with a level of class and 
meticulous arrangement that has become her 
trademark. The record percolates La Havas’s 
thoughts and emotions through a filter of musi-
cal wisdom only she could provide.
Though this is La Havas’s third record, in 
many ways it seems like a reclamation of self, 
a debut-do-over of sorts. With this release, the 
songwriter consistently redefines the unique 
style that put her on the map in the first place 
— her skilled blues guitar, cheeky British 
vocalizations and soulful lyrics — with a more 
mature and lived-in perspective. It’s almost like 
we’re meeting her all over again, and it’s a joy 
to experience.

The last time I was in a theatre was an 
oddly outstanding experience. It was Feb. 29 
— leap year Saturday — and I was nestled in 
one of the 2,256 red velvet seats of London’s 
Royal Opera House. That morning, I had 
crawled off the cramped seat of a transat-
lantic flight that had brought me there from 
Detroit and napped only briefly in my friend’s 
apartment. By the time the lights dimmed 
and the orchestra finished tuning, the jet 
lag had already made my eyes heavy and my 
body limp. Nevertheless, my mind stayed 
sharply awake: I had saved and splurged for 
a week-long Spring Break adventure, and the 
only available day to see the Royal Ballet was 
the evening that I got there. I was not going 
to waste it. I bought the cheapest tickets and 
got to the opera house a full hour-and-a-half 
early. 
It was only upon opening the program that 
I realized I had unknowingly purchased tick-
ets to the retirement performance of Thiago 
Soares, a dancer I had been watching on You-
Tube for years. When the show ended, sup-
porters threw buckets of flowers onto the 
stage until the brown flooring was impossible 
to delineate from the white and yellow rose 
petals. I stood watching until the absolute 
end, so tired I could barely stand but still not 
wanting to leave. 
At the time, I didn’t realize that this would 
be the last time I stood in a theatre for what 
will likely become over a year. I didn’t real-
ize that it would only be a few days before 
the Royal Opera House closed in response 
to dangers regarding COVID-19. By the time 
I flew back to Michigan a week later, people 
were already wearing masks on their faces 
with panic in their eyes. But my ignorance of 
the sudden changes ahead did not decrease 
my perception of the extraordinary present: 
The shift in time zones and leap year calen-
dar date were backdrops to the unannounced 
floral show and the sheer insanity of my feet 
on the Royal Opera House floor. Looming 
pandemic aside, I knew this experience was 
singular and special. 
Friday, I saw the Royal Opera House again. 
This time it was on my TV, because the com-
pany streamed a complete recording of “The 
Sleeping Beauty.” I sat on the couch in sweat-
pants underneath the warmth of two blan-
kets and watched the entire two-and-a-half 
hour show. The music was beautiful, the cos-
tumes exquisite, the dancers delightful. But 
the opulence was, of course, not the same. 
“The Sleeping Beauty” is a ballet full of 
tricks, especially for Princess Aurora, here 
played by Fumi Kaneko. In the first act, the 
princess makes an explosive entrance only 

to be followed by the long and luscious Rose 
Adage, a dance with four suitors that is, 
undramatically, one of the hardest six min-
utes of a ballerina’s career. The scene is a mar-
athon of brute strength masked by delicate 
grace that culminates in a set of balances atop 
one pointe shoe. The suspense of the whole 
endeavour makes it a performance especially 
well-suited for live audience. The balance is 
so difficult that it’s impossible to predict the 
ballerina’s success — instead, you sit helpless 
in the audience, willing her to succeed. The 
first time I sat in a dark theatre and watched a 
dancer step into her Rose Adage balance, my 
heart raced and my breathing became short. I 
felt intrinsically involved in her work. 
On my TV, Kaneko hit each balance sol-
idly. She even held the last one for an extra-
impressive second before finishing to roaring 
applause. But my heart rate didn’t spike; I 
knew the Royal Opera House wouldn’t stream 
a performance with a faulty Rose Adage. The 
recording was too safe to be exciting. Plus, I 
was on my couch — there was a distinct lack 
of red velvet and golden lighting. The magic 
just wasn’t there. 
At the show’s first intermission — on You-
Tube merely treated as a short pause and a 
repeated request for donations — I picked up 
my phone and absentmindedly allowed my 
thumbs to take me to Instagram. Then, on 
the Royal Opera House’s account, I read that 
Kaneko had only learned she was cast in this 
performance the morning of the recording. 
She knew the role from past runs, but in this 
instance she had less than a day to prepare. 
What a detail! The behind-the-scenes excite-
ment suddenly piqued my interest. I thought 
about those balances again: How many times 
had she been able to practice? How many 
rehearsals did she have in that tutu? When 
the second act started, I felt more anticipa-
tion than before. Sure, I knew she’d land her 
turns and sustain her extensions, but instead 
I could take advantage of the up-close camera 
angle and look at her face and eyes. I imag-
ined what she might be thinking, how her 
day’s chaos may have unfolded. 
The amount of prep time a dancer has is 
not something that would ever be written 
in a performance’s program, nor would it be 
announced over a loudspeaker before the 
overture’s first notes. In the world of live per-
formance, such details do not matter — when 
the curtain lifts, the world pauses. Asterisks 
about how one’s day went are less interesting 
than artists who can suspend reality. Over 
a screen, though, things feel a lot different. 
Context matters — in fact, it helps.

Is it love or Asian fetish?

“Look, I’m a tall guy; I’m just attracted to 
small, cute girls. They happen to be Asian, 
but I don’t have yellow fever.” 
The friend I made in the beginning of the 
school year was trying to explain how he — 
a white male — did not have an Asian fetish, 
but he was doing a poor job at that. 
Later on, I learned he was a dominant and 
masochist when he overshared his sex life 
and announced his BDSM test results to me 
and a few other friends. He liked the power 
dynamic between him and his petite Asian 
girlfriend. He was also an avid fan of Asian 
porn. Small and cute were the adjectives he 
used to describe his type, but in hindsight, I 
think they were synonymous with submis-
sive and docile. To me, he has yellow fever.
The term “yellow fever” originates from 
the afterword to the 1988 play M. Butterfly by 
David Henry Hwang, who uses it to describe 
white men who have a fetish towards east 
Asian women. Similar to “jungle fever,” or 
having a fetish towards Black women, it 
holds a derogatory connotation. The attrac-
tion towards a person of color is not wrong 
or a problem, but a fetish rather insinuates 
the attraction to something that one should 
not like, and are therefore wrong or ill for 
indulging in it. The term has also broadened 
into a label for men with hypersexualized 
fantasies of getting romantically involved 
with stereotypical subservient Asian women 
exclusively or near exclusively. 
This submissive Asian woman trope is 
manifested across pop culture and media. 
Asian women are underrepresented in this 
sector, but when they are featured, their 
roles are often limited to either the innocent 
and dainty Asian or the bold and rebellious 
Asian with a hair streak — a failed attempt 
at subverting the former trope and even 
a reinforcement of that exact stereotype. 
The character Lara Jean Song-Covey in the 
movie “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” is 
one depiction of the shy Asian girl commonly 
found in many other films, shows and novels.

Since arriving at the University of Michi-
gan, I have taken Arabic language classes 
every single semester. As a rising junior, I 
have grown to deeply love the language and 
the cultural history that informs it. If the 
pandemic permits, I am planning to study 
abroad this upcoming summer to improve 
my skills and immerse myself in an Arabic-
speaking community. However, there has 
been an omnipresent and increasingly dis-
turbing trend throughout my semesters of 
taking Arabic. In my classes, there has almost 
always been a student (often a cis white man) 
who is taking Arabic because they want 
to join the CIA, the FBI or the military in 
the future. While I understand the draw of 
learning a language to improve potential 
hireability, the fact that these institutions 
have directly harmed Arab communities for 
decades is an alarming truth. Taking Arabic 
to make yourself more valuable to a system 
which intensely surveils Arab communities 
in the United States and continues to back 
states who commit crimes against human-
ity against Arabic-speaking people — read 
Israel and Palestine — demonstrates a fright-
ening level of apathy. Then to learn Arabic 
while also continuing to hold prejudices and 
negative stereotypes about Arabic-speaking 
people shows they will perpetuate the cur-
rent systems of “enhanced interrogation” 
and turning a blind eye. 
Even more concerning is their naivety 
when declaring their pride in such a career 
goal to the students, faculty and staff around 
them. Many of our peers are students who 
identify as being of Arab or Middle East 
North African descent. As a student who 
doesn’t identify as Arab or MENA, I am 
made uncomfortable by their presence, and 
while I don’t speak for those who do, I can’t 

imagine what it is like for my classmates It 
has almost become a joke in our classes, to 
guess who the future FBI or CIA employee 
is. This normalization means this is an issue 
which absolutely needs to be addressed. 
Learning a language to extract information, 
torture and continue decades of harm seems 
like an intense bastardization of the reason 
for learning languages in the first place. 
What makes it even more important to have 
this conversation about Arabic is how these 
communities are treated and stereotyped in 
the United States. 
I will now speak directly to you — you who 
is taking Arabic to join the CIA, the FBI, the 
military or something equally damaging. 
First, it’s not too late to change. To learn. To 
be better. Educate yourself not only about the 
Arabic language, but also about the people 
and the culture that it comes from. Reevalu-
ate how and why your use of this language 
could bring harm. How we outsiders — as 
non-Arab or MENA identifying Americans 
— need to hold ourselves accountable and 
intently reflect to see if we’re really living up 
to the best we can be. We need to question if 
we’re being revolutionary in our learning. If 
we’re learning for the sake of growth rather 
than destruction. I know this is a hard truth 
and giving up what could be a lifelong dream 
is terrifying and disorienting. I raise the 
point that if your dream brings harm to those 
around you, was it the right dream to have 
in the first place? I believe firmly in never 
isolating people in their worst moments or 
in their deepest ignorance. This is a call to 
action, to reevaluate how you show up in our 
classes and where we should or should not 
take up space. We are privileged in how we 
are able to learn Arabic without being direct-
ly impacted by all of the cultural...

One department with a high demand 
for Asian women, however, is the adult 
entertainment industry. The top two most 
searched terms on Pornhub in 2019 were 
Japanese and hentai, which is sexually 
explicit Japanese anime or manga. Not far 
below are Korean and Asian, ranked fifth 
and sixth, respectively. Yet, the representa-
tion of Asian women in pornography still 
lacks diversity and upholds the aforemen-
tioned stereotypes to a highly sexualized 
degree. They are infantilized and dominat-
ed, all while putting up a smile. Somehow, 
the model minority myth follows through in 
pornos, too. Our stereotypically compliant 
and obedient demeanor — which they cre-
ated — is what makes others accept Asians 
more than other races in the real world and 
in adult entertainment. Given the lack of 
diverse Asian characters and the abundance 
of the same and typically sexualized arche-
types in Hollywood and American media, 
it comes to no surprise we are fetishized by 
Westerners. 
As a Chinese-American female, it’s off 
putting to see non-Asian men lewdly com-
ment about our ethnicity or race as a means 
to pursue Asian women. It is not flattering 
to know the selling point of our attractive-
ness is the misperception of how subservient 
and exotic the women of our race are. Being 
categorized as “oriental,” “lotus flower,” 
“delicate” and “China doll” is far from a com-
pliment and more of an oversexualized deg-
radation of our ethnicity or race. Rather than 
approaching Asian women with sentiments 
of exoticism, understand we are not foreign 
creatures without an ounce of self-will who 
are in dire need of a strong non-Asian man 
to colonize our bodies. Many of us were born 
and raised in America and consume Western 
culture; we are capable of holding intersec-
tional feminist beliefs as much as the non-
conformist American women who these men 
are so afraid of.

My experience in a COVID-19 hotspot 

Recently, my family drove down 
to Tennessee to immerse ourselves 
in nature and find some peace and 
adventure during such dystopian 
times. While being up in the Smoky 
Mountains was beautiful and well 
worth the trip, it was also scary 
driving past the crowds of locals.
Tennessee is one of eighteen 
other states recognized as a COVID 
“red zone” with limited safety 
measures. The Center for Public 
Integrity defined these red zones 
as having more than 100 new cases 
per every 100,000 people within 
the last week. They were previ-
ously indicated to be in the yellow 
zone for test positivity between 
5-10 percent. While federal rec-
ommendations have been made 
such as closing bars and gyms and 
encouraging more outdoor dining, 
this is far from what I saw.

MENA: America’s ‘white’ minority group

Throughout the course of my 
academic career, my race has 
“changed” three times. In elemen-
tary school, I was advised by my 
teacher to bubble in “Asian” on a 
standardized test since my parents’ 
mother countries of Iraq and Leba-
non are geographically located on 
the continent of Asia. A few years 
later in middle school my race was 
suddenly “Other” since Asian was 
reserved for Southeast Asia and 
India. Then, when I went to take 
the PSAT my freshman year of 
high school, there was a startling 
new addition to the race category: 
“White (including Middle Eastern 
origin).” Of all the questions on the 
exam, and this was the most con-
fusing bubble I had to fill in — to 
identify myself.
The generalization and erasure 
of Middle Eastern and North Afri-
can culture has been a constant 
tumultuous addition to the already 
ongoing identity struggle many 
young adults go through. MENA 
Americans and white Americans 
have different reputations, differ-
ent cultures and different struggles 
in the United States. Even now as I 
write in a newspaper section des-
ignated for students of color, the 
U.S. government continues to label 
me as white. These two statements 

GRACE GARMO
MiC Staff Writer

directly contradict each other, yet it 
is a perfect analogy for how we are 
treated and perceived in America. 
Bubbling in “white” in the race cat-
egory on any standardized test or 
legal form almost feels like disre-
spect, because throughout my life, 
several of my white classmates per-
sistently made it a point to socially 
isolate me and made sure I knew 
that we were not the same. Token-
ing Middle Easterners as “white” 
when convenient and “Other” 
when convenient is how American 
society interacts with us histori-
cally, and now, it has been declared 
on a piece of paper.
When I bubble in “white,” I am 
actively neglecting my arched eye-
brows, my enlarged nose, my olive 
complexion and my thick dark hair. 
I am repressing all the times my 
peers have asked me if my family 
is associated with terrorist orga-
nizations and snuck judgemental 
looks at my parents while speak-
ing our native tongue. I am shov-
ing aside my identity struggles as 
an Arab-American who has no race 
to identify with because we were 
an afterthought without a spot left 
for us. As a community, MENA 
individuals socially receive the 
negative consequences of having a 
minority status, yet on legal docu-
ments we are forced to check a box 
that misrepresents us.

As if the local Trump hats and 
Confederate flags weren’t disturb-
ing enough, the majority of the 
tourists and locals refused to wear 
masks. Young and old alike would 
walk about downtown like noth-
ing has changed. The only mask 
enforcement was inside shops and 
restaurants; even then those masks 
were worn with noses exposed. 
The majority of the people in 
Gatlinburg, Tenn., where I had 
briefly stayed, were majority white 
and from the South, coming from 
states with few governmental 
restrictions imposed. Therefore 
any families who wore masks were 
openly ridiculed and mocked. The 
unspoken consensus was to be 
complicit in carelessness — as if 
“coronavirus is a hoax.”
Mind you, this isn’t some made 
up remark. Along the trip, I came 
across a family on a trail from Lou-
isiana. She remarked that the case 
numbers are fake and that, at its 

worst, the virus manifests like that 
of a common cold. “People aren’t 
really dying from COVID, the sur-
vival rate is 99.99 percent,” she 
exclaimed. 
She 
begrudgingly 
mentioned 
the current state and public health 
protocols were impending upon 
watching their football games. I 
remember giving my brother an 
exasperated look as we left them.
I think the concept of social 
distancing and masking has some 
unnecessary 
negative 
connota-
tions. The idea of wearing a mask 
has been seen as almost exagger-
ated to be oppressively restricting. 
While the yellow zone indicated 
above for Tennessee may seem 
small, it demonstrates these num-
bers are only increasing and nation-
ally indicates poor implementation 
of federalized mandates to dimin-
ish exposure. 
How do you get someone to 
internalize what it means to be in a 

was a tremendously crucial factor 
in my college application process. 
I was excited to add to the univer-
sities’ cultural variation and share 
my experiences with my new peers. 
However, every time I got my hopes 
up, the same realization would 
dawn on me: I won’t be counted. 
When researching the Univer-
sity of Michigan’s undergraduate 
demographic, I couldn’t even tell 
how many MENA students there 
were. All I could see in the pie chart 
was a large slice of ‘white,” and my 
identity was lost somewhere with-
in it. Despite the Common Applica-

tion allowing students to make the 
distinction between “white (Euro-
pean)” and “white (Middle East-
ern),” all this did was give MENA 
students a false glimmer of hope 
despite a total lack of practical-
ity. The fact that MENA students 
get excited when our existence is 
officially acknowledged on a form 
blatantly illuminates the problem 
at hand. 
On the U.S. Census, tens of thou-
sands of Hispanic or Latinx indi-
viduals bubble in “white,” yet also 
have the opportunity to make the 
distinction of their ethnic back-

ground which shows up on virtual-
ly every legal form. This distinction 
is commendable, and I believe that 
MENA individuals should have the 
same opportunity. Especially in a 
post 9/11 world, Muslims and Arabs 
have become a larger target for dis-
crimination, and it is crucial that 
we have a separate legal identifica-
tion to ensure that the MENA pop-
ulation is showing up to the polls, 
securing jobs at a consistent rate, 
and graduating from high school.

In bubble, Mikie Schlosser is only focused on winning

In coming weeks, fans of 

major 
professional 
televised 

sports leagues like the MLB, 
NBA and NHL will see the highly 
anticipated returns of sports in 
the form of abbreviated, COVID-
19-adjusted seasons. The NBA is 
creating a local bubble, while 
the MLB is trying its best to keep 
its employees socially isolated 
— the latter of which being an 
incredibly difficult avenue that 
college athletics will most likely 
pursue, should there be sports 
this fall.

But before most of these 

leagues even begin, fans of 
Major League Lacrosse (MLL), 
one of two major professional 
field lacrosse leagues in the 
United States, will already have 
seen their season come and go 
barring any disruptions.

The 
MLL’s 
20th 
season 

kicked off its nine-day stretch 
last weekend and will conclude 
this weekend with a four-team 
playoff starting Saturday and 
championship 
game 
for 
the 

Steinfeld Trophy on Sunday. 
Throughout 
the 
week, 
the 

league has carried out its regular 
season with all six teams playing 
five games in seven days inside 
an empty Navy-Marine Corps 
Memorial Stadium at the Naval 
Academy in Annapolis, Md. 

To 
ensure 
proper 
social 

distancing and public health 
measures are taken, all players 
were tested prior to arrival and 
are receiving daily temperature 
checks. 
In 
addition, 
team 

benches 
reside 
on 
opposite 

sidelines as opposed to their 
typical configuration of side-by-
side.

Since its inception in 2000, 

the MLL has endured a series 
of business booms and busts, 
expansions and contractions, in 
an attempt to grow the game of 
lacrosse in markets across the 
country. 

So, after 20 years, it is only 

natural 
that 
the 
MLL 
has 

adapted to the hurdle of COVID-
19 and has been able to put forth 
another season.

Although a plethora of talent 

exited the league in 2019 to go 
to a newer touring league — the 
Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) 
— some, like Denver Outlaws 
midfielder 
Mikie 
Schlosser, 

remain 
committed 
to 
the 

league. And while this season’s 
parameters are less than ideal, 
Schlosser is just grateful for the 
opportunity to play lacrosse.

“I think the league is very 

resilient,” 
Schlosser 
said. 

“They’ve done a lot to change 
and keep up with the times. I’m 
just very fortunate that they’re 
able to put on (this season) and 
give us a chance to play and the 
fans a chance to watch. That’s 
what it’s all about.”

Schlosser 
played 
for 
the 

Michigan men’s lacrosse team 
from 2014 to 2017 and was a key 
offensive contributor during all 
four years, recording 50 career 
goals and serving as a captain 
his junior and senior seasons.

Since graduating college and 

entering the MLL, Schlosser 
has dished out 41 goals and 10 
assists in three seasons with the 
Outlaws. Last year, Schlosser 
scored 17 goals and earned 
his first trip to the MLL All-
Star game, but the Outlaws 
failed 
to 
win 
back-to-back 

championships after a 10-9 loss 
in the 2019 MLL championship 
game 
to 
the 
Chesapeake 

Bayhawks.

With a shot for redemption 

and the season up in the air 
with 
COVID-19, 
Schlosser 

spent the past couple months of 
quarantine training to get back 
to that moment.

“Our goal every year is to 

win a championship,” Schlosser 
said. “That’s the only thing we 
are trying to achieve here. The 
individual stuff guys couldn’t 
really care less for. … At the 
end of the day, things are fun 
if you’re successful. No matter 
what happens during the game, 
if we win, I’m happy. It’s kinda 
all or nothing. It’s hard to have 
fun if you lose in my opinion.”

With the season underway, 

his 
training 
has 
paid 
off. 

Through four games, Schlosser 
has already notched three goals 
and one assist. The Outlaws are 
undefeated and, having already 
clinched a playoff berth, are 
poised to have another shot at 
the title. 

This 
season, 
the 
MLL 

expanded the active day roster 
for teams from 19 to 25 players. 
Schlosser believes that a deeper 
roster has allowed Denver to 
overcome the physical stress of 
playing so many games in such 
a short timespan. In a typical 
MLL season, teams will play 
once a week, but this week, each 
team is guaranteed to play at 
least five games.

“We’re able to cycle through a 

lot more players,” Schlosser said. 
“I think our games seem pretty 
fresh still just considering we 
have extra subs that we normally 
wouldn’t have. So I think that is 
allowing people to get their rest 
and not (exert themselves) as 
hard in the games.

“So far I think we’re off to a 

good start. We just gotta try to 
keep getting better each game 
and keep having fun.”

In the MLL bubble, Schlosser 

and his teammates have made an 
effort to cram a typical summer’s 
worth of fun and memories into 
just over one week inside their 
hotel. 
Whether 
it’s 
playing 

Wii Sports in someone’s room, 
joking around in the shuttle to 
the stadium or getting together 
after a game for a team dinner, 
the Outlaws are working on 
building a tight team bond off 
the field with the hopes that it 
will produce positive results on 
the field.

“I think a big thing, especially 

at this level, is that there’s a lot of 
talent everywhere, so you have 
to enjoy the moment and enjoy 
being with the guys,” Schlosser 
said. 
“Because 
that’s 
what 

ultimately makes a difference in 
the end. I love competing with 
my teammates and winning. I 
think that’s kind of how I put it 
all together.”

The lacrosse community will 

look back on the MLL’s 20th 
anniversary 
season 
someday, 

and it will be impossible to 
ignore its peculiarities. It will 
mark a period of adversity, 
excitement and quite possibly 
evolution, for a league that has 
struggled to manage the rise of 
the PLL and its own internal 
battles.

Still, despite those daunting 

challenges, it’s a season that’s 
happening 
because 
it 
could 

bubble its players — the one 
sure-fire way to protect athletes 
and staff without a vaccine 
available.

Four sports shut down voluntary workouts due to COVID-19

Less 
than 
a 
week 
after 

Michigan State football halted 
its practices and went into a 
14-day 
quarantine, 
Michigan

is pausing voluntary workouts 
for 
ice 
hockey, 
volleyball, 

swimming and diving and field 
hockey, an athletic department 
spokesperson told The Daily.

Workouts have been paused 

because of both positive COVID-
19 
test 
results 
and 
contact 

tracing, according to a statement 
sent by the athletic department. 
The hockey team will resume 
workouts this week, with other 
programs scheduled to resume 
the week of August 3.

The University’s latest release 

last week revealed that 12 of 559 
student-athlete 
tests 
returned 

positive, and just one of 170 staff 
members tested positive. Men’s 
and 
women’s 
basketball 
and 

football have been on campus 
since mid-June, and their low test 
rates have not forced a shut down 
of activities.

“I would feel good with the 

medical oversight of the students, 
student athletes,” football coach 
Jim Harbaugh said on a Zoom 
call with media in early July. “I 

would want the responsibility. I 
would want the responsibility of 
keeping our players safe and also 
educating them. I would not want 
to come off of that guard tower 
of educating and keeping our 
players safe.

“Now, if it comes to a point in 

time where you say that we can’t 
play, it’s obvious, it’s clear, then 
everybody would be reasonable 
and know that was the right 
thing to do. COVID is part of our 
society. Wasn’t caused by football 
or caused by sports. And there’s 
no expert view right now that I’m 
aware of that sports is going to 
make that worse. It’s part of our 
society, we’re going to have to 
deal with it.”

A spokesperson for the football 

program confirmed the team is 
moving as scheduled as of now. 
The NCAA is currently allowing 
20-hour practice weeks, split up 
by up to eight hours for weight 
lifting and conditioning, up to six 
hours for walkthrough practices
and up to six hours for team 
meetings. Helmets and pads are 
not yet allowed.

As for the sports whose training 

has been stopped, this isn’t a 
death knell for anyone’s season. 
But, like every other program in 
the country that’s needed to stop 

workouts, it highlights just how 
hard a season will be to pull off. 
As of now, the Big Ten is trying 
to do so by playing a conference-
only schedule for fall sports. 
What those plans will look like 
two weeks — or one month — 
from now is anyone’s guess.

“That whole process is going 

about as smooth as it could, 
but there’ll be a lot of hiccups,” 
volleyball coach Mark Rosen 
told The Daily in an interview 
last week. “One of the things I’ve 
learned through this process is 
that you have to be flexible and 
you have to understand that 
things are going to change. They 

literally change by the minute 
almost.

“We know our plans might get 

blown up any minute. We have to 
be ready for that.”

Former Wolverine Morgan Overaitis transfers to Virginia Tech

Back in April, just a month after 

Michigan softball lost their season 
to COVID-19, the Wolverines also 
lost former No. 18 FloSoftball 
prospect Morgan Overaitis to the 
transfer portal. 

Overaitis made the decision to 

transfer to Virginia Tech after 
her sophomore year and will be 
immediately eligible to play after 
enrolling in classes this fall.

This spring, Overaitis started 14 

games and appeared in 20, splitting 
time between right field, second 
base and designated player. In her 
freshman season, she started just 
nine games, hitting at a .255 clip.

From 
Canton, 
Michigan, 

Overaitis was a stud in high school. 
She was awarded Softball Player 
of the Year by the Detroit Free 
Press in 2018 and was a four-time 
All-State 
first-teamer, 
earning 

her a spot amongst the nation’s 
best prospects. At Salem High 
School, Overaitis holds the school 

record of 38 home runs with 223 
RBI, all while posting a .586 
batting average and .643 on-base 

percentage.

At 
Michigan, 
however, 

Overaitis’ skills were slow to 

translate and resulted in less 
playing time than what might be 
expected based on her high school 
career. Her .265 batting average 
across two seasons, accompanied 
by lowly slugging percentages of 
.333 and .319 in her freshman and 
sophomore years.

Fellow sophomore Lexie Blair, 

who came in as FloSoftball’s 
28th-ranked player, claimed her 
role in the lineup with her .406 
batting average her freshman 
year. In Blair’s sophomore year, 
she hit .307 despite early-season 
struggles. The result for Blair is 81 
games started across two seasons, 
58 more than Overaitis. With 
competition like Blair, Overaitis 
was never able to find a consistent 
spot in the starting lineup.

By leaving Michigan to become 

a Hokie, Overaitis may find a fresh 
start and a more comfortable 
location to prove herself worthy of 
that No. 18 ranking.

Incoming junior Morgan Overaitis is set to become a Hokie next spring following her transfer to Virginia Tech.

Barriers remain between Black athletes and college athletics

In 
the 
1880s 
with 
Moses 

Fleetwood 
Walker, 
Michigan 

baseball became one of the first 
colleges to have a Black baseball 
player. In 1890, George Jewett joined 
the Michigan football team as a 
halfback — the University and the 
Big Ten’s first Black football player. 

Forty years and Fielding Yost 

passed until Michigan had another 
Black football player with Willis 
Ward, and even then he faced racial 
discrimination after being barred 
from playing against Georgia Tech 
for the color of his skin. Just 12 Black 
players played for the University 
prior to 1941, and those athletes had 
to meet a criteria of excellence. For 
most, including William DeHart 
Hubbard, 
that 
meant 
Olympic 

champion 
performance. 
The 

basketball program championed its 
lacking diversity until 1951, when 
Ernie McCoy finally integrated 
with Don Eaddy and John Codwell 
— three years after Bill Garrett 
and Indiana broke the Big Ten’s 
gentleman’s agreement to keep Black 
players off the court. And in baseball 
— the first sport to have a Black 
athlete at Michigan — from 1880 to 
1972 just seven Black players lettered 
on varsity.

In 2019, 41.55 percent of Big Ten 

men’s basketball athletes were Black 
and 38.86 percent of football players 
were Black. Most other sports in the 
Big Ten are far from those inclusive 
representatives. If men’s and 

women’s track and field, men’s and 
women’s basketball, and football did 
not exist, the percentage of Black Big 
Ten athletes falls from 14.39 percent 
to 6.55 percent. The total number of 
Black athletes plummets from 1,628 
to 512.

The Big Ten’s history is fraught 

with racial pioneering and foot 
dragging, however, the lack of Black 
athletes in sports outside those five 
competitions isn’t a byproduct of a 
gentleman’s agreement or overtly 
racial policies. It runs much deeper 
and subtler. 

David Ogden’s Welcome Theory 

breaks down one reason why the 
number of Black players going into 
the MLB is decreasing — Black 
children don’t see people that look 
like them play the sport. When 
children see people that look like 
them in a sport or profession, they 
are more likely to have aspirations in 
that field. In basketball and football, 
Black children know they won’t be 
singled-out for the color of their skin 
as often. The same can’t be said for 
lacrosse. 

In baseball — a sport ripe with 

racial history — the breakthrough of 
Jackie Robinson saw a skyrocket in 
Black professional baseball players, 
reaching as high as 27 percent of 
the MLB in 1975. Now, that number 
is down to eight percent, with the 
college game looking even bleaker.

Just six percent of Division 1 

baseball student-athletes were Black 
in 2019. In the Big Ten, that number 
rests just under 5 percent. That’s 23 
Black players. Michigan had five, and 

only because of a concerted effort 
to recruit Black players. In 2013, 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich’s first 
season, Michigan had an all-white 
team and all of the Big Ten had nine 
Black players — just seven years ago. 

There aren’t a lot of Black athletes 

playing baseball in college anymore, 
there haven’t been a plethora of Black 
role models in the sport for years. 
While suburbs and small towns can 
fit plenty of baseball fields, cities — 
where a large portion of America’s 
Black population resides — don’t 
have that same luxury. 

Beyond the Welcome Theory, 

another reason for the lack of 
diversity is that there aren’t as many 
scholarships available for sports 
outside the big three (men’s and 
women’s basketball and football), 
so potential Black student-athletes 
who excel at sports like swimming 
or tennis, yet struggle economically, 
can’t afford to go to college and play 
those sports.

In college baseball, there just 

aren’t 
enough 
scholarships. 
A 

maximum of 11.7 go to the baseball 
team, which has a roster of 35 
players, and ends up only sparing 
athletes about 25 percent of the 
cost of tuition. And, until August 
2020, need-based or merit-awarded 
scholarships counted against that 
total, directly affecting poorer Black 
athletes.

Tangentially 
related 
to 

scholarships is that youth sports 
— lacrosse, hockey, field hockey 
— all cost money. These sports 
cost hundreds to thousands of 

dollars a year to sign up for leagues, 
tournaments, 
uniforms 
and 

equipment, a burden that hits most 
middle-class families hard. But 
when taken into account that the 
median Black family in the United 
States earns $28,000 less than the 
median white family, those pay-to-
play sports become nearly impossible 
to afford and thus, these children are 
never exposed to high levels of them. 

Travel ball, which is a must for 

any player hoping to compete in or 
beyond college baseball, can cost 
upwards of $5,000 a year from 
tournament fees, uniforms, hotels, 
equipment and so much more. 

“There are so many outstanding 

players of color often hidden in poor 
communities who just aren’t able 
to play on those expensive travel 
teams or make their rounds on the 
summer circuit,” Bakich told The 
Daily in 2019. “So when you can find 
those guys and target those guys and 
have kids from all backgrounds and 
socioeconomic statuses. … I think 
it’s a win not only for them and their 
families but also for our program and 
for everyone on our team, which is 
why we recruit the way we do.”

Not all coaches can be as proactive 

as Bakich, not every coach in the 
nation can look four hours West and 
see a hotbed of under-appreciated 
talent. There aren’t programs which 
subsidize tournaments or scouting 
camps for every sport like Chicago 
White Sox ACE does for baseball 
or Nike and Adidas do for AAU 
basketball. 

To get a field hockey equipment 

grant from The Hockey Foundation, 
the program you play for has to 
fill out an application. To play in 
MLS’s DC United youth academy, 
the highest domestic level of youth 
competition, you have to pay $1,500, 
with scholarships you need to apply 
for. 

It’s an issue that’s persisted since 

the 70s, when G. Anderson White, 
the first Black diver for Michigan, 
said in a 1972 interview with John 
Behee, “How many Black kids can 
afford to go to Florida and shell out 
the $80-100 a week costs? … The lack 
of opportunity to learn from talented 
coaches, coupled with a lack of pools 
and pool facilities for competition, 
therein lies the explanation for so 
few Black swimmers.”

And still, even with the ACE 

program and a proactive mentality, 
Michigan baseball played its 2020 
season with just five Black players 
on its roster. The men’s basketball 
program — with a roster less than 
half the size of baseball’s — had 
seven. 

Today, the reason for lack of 

diversity isn’t nearly as explicit as it 
was during the first half of the 20th 
century. No coach can deny a player 
a place on their team solely because 
of the color of their skin, or say that 
the problems their skin color brings 
outweigh their talent. Instead, like 
the broader issue of inequality, 
it’s an institutional issue rooted in 
economic and demographic barriers 
that prohibit Black children from 
exposure to high levels of sport that 
White children take for granted.
