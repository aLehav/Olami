Author speaks on role of 
White House Chief of Staff

Lauded filmmaker 
explains duties of the 
“gatekeeper” to the
federal government 

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

 On Tuesday night, Chris 

Whipple — an acclaimed filmmaker 
of pictures such as The Spymasters, 
author 
and 
Emmy 
Award-

winning producer — presented the 
importance of the White House 
Chief of Staff, a role he describes 
as the second most powerful 
job in government, to a crowd of 
approximately 200 at the Gerald R. 
Ford Library.

Central to his discussion was his 

2017 book “The Gatekeepers: How 
the White House Chiefs of Staff 
Define Every Presidency,” which 
includes conversations with all 17 
living chiefs of staff and two former 
presidents. He also referenced 
and showed clips from his 2013 
documentary 
“The 
Presidents’ 

Gatekeepers,” 
which 
similarly 

features chiefs discussing the past 
nine presidential administrations, 
approximately 50 years of office.

The Chief of Staff is sometimes 

referred to as the “gatekeeper” 
— the individual who decides 
who can enter the Oval Office, 
communicates 
often 
with 
the 

president and works as a secretary 
of sorts. His tasks include advising 
the president and negotiating with 
Congress, among others; the role is 
seen as the highest-ranked position 
in the White House.

Whipple explained, the job of 

White House Chief of Staff as it 
exists today was created by H. R. 
Haldeman — a chief of staff under 
then-President 
Richard 
Nixon, 

who served 18 months in prison 
for conspiracy in the Watergate 
scandal.

“Haldeman is a fascinating 

character because, on the one 
hand, he failed to speak truth to 
Richard Nixon for the Watergate 
cover infamously, and yet ultimate 
successors will tell you he created 
a 
template 
for 
the 
modern, 

empowered White House Chief of 

Staff,” he said.

Whipple said every president 

learns, often the hard way, he 
cannot govern effectively without 
empowering a White House Chief 
of Staff to execute his agenda and 
tell him what he doesn’t want to 
hear. He explained that today, 
President Donald J. Trump does not 
seem to be aware of this fact.

“Modern 
history 
is 
littered 

with the wreckage of presidencies 
that did not understand that,” he 
said. “It’s a lesson that our current 
president, oblivious to history, 
either has not learned or has chosen 
to ignore.”

From the Watergate scandal 

to the Iran-Contra scandal to the 
Monica Lewinski scandal, the 
Chief of Staff makes the difference 
between success and disaster, 
he explained. He elaborated that 
though the Nixon White House 
neared disaster, it could have been 
worse if it were not for Haldeman 
who often “talked Nixon off the 
ledge” — strongly advising the 
president against acts that seemed 
inappropriate.

Panel goals were to 
identify problems and 
inequities within the 
Medical School

By ALON SAMUEL

Daily Staff Reporter

Close to 200 attendees filled 

the Kahn Auditorium of the 
Biomedical 
Science 
Research 

Building Wednesday morning for 
a symposium titled “Strategies 
to Empower Women to Achieve 
Academic 
Success,” 
which 

examined 
gender 
gaps 
and 

inequities in the medical academic 
world, as well as strategies to 
overcome them.

Beginning with two keynote 

speakers and followed by a panel 
discussion and focus groups, the 
symposium 
aimed 
to 
identify 

problems and inequities in the 
University of Michigan Medical 
School as well as the field in general 
and develop workable strategies 
to tackle them, according to Eva 
Feldman, director of the Taubman 
Medical Research Institute.

“We 
want 
to 
have 
clear 

deliverables from today,” Feldman 
said. “I hope as a first step, this is 
the first conversation of many, but 
the content of this conversation 
is not going to end when we leave 
this room at 11 o’clock, but rather 
it’s going to be carried forward in a 
very systematic way.”

Downtown African American Festival 
celebrates with food, music and art

This year included 

more vendors 
than years past 
with a mix of 

experienced and 
new businesses 

By KENNEDY WERNER

Daily Staff Reporter

“The Cha-Cha Slide” rang 

through 
the 
speakers 
while 

attendees clapped and danced 
along, as part of the hundreds 
gathered 
for 
the 
African 

American Downtown Festival 
Saturday. 
The 
entertainment 

included a live band and DJ, 
with all band members decked 
out in white uniforms. Mascot 
characters were also present 
to keep spirits high on the hot, 
sunny day.

Community members from the 

greater Washtenaw County area 

came together for the annual 
festival, which lasted all day. 
The event featured authentic 
foods, crafts, fashion and other 
Afrocentric arts.

Ann Arbor resident and event 

volunteer Jeren Calhoun has 
worked for the festival since its 
start 22 years ago. She noted the 
importance of the event taking 
place on North Fourth Avenue 
and East Ann Street, which 
is Ann Arbor’s Historic Black 
Business District.

“This neighborhood used to 

be known for African-American-
owned 
businesses,” 
Calhoun 

said. “You see now it’s not the old 
landstrip that I remember when 
I first came here. But still this is 
downtown Ann Arbor, which is 
a plus for African Americans to 
come down and have a festival of 
our own people.”

Organized by the Ann Arbor 

Cultural and Community Events 
Coalition, the traditional event 
aims to cater to all ages. A live 
band performed jazz, pop and 
dance music. Attendees crowded 

in front of the stage to dance 
and sing along. Vendors sold 
lemonade, BBQ meats, jewelry, 
handmade arts, clothing, books 
and various beauty products. 

This 
year 
included 
more 

vendors than years past with a 
mixed of experienced and new 
businesses. 

Charles 
Young, 
owner 
of 

Charles Collectibles, has been 
coming to the festival for twelve 
years. 
Charles 
Collectibles 

is a traveling bookstore that 
specializes in Afrocentric books, 
Negro League Baseball, Black 
College, 
Tuskegee 
Airmen, 

Buffalo 
Soldier, 
Black 
Fives 

Apparel and memorabilia.

“I 
enjoy 
what 
I’m 
doing 

because I get a chance to educate 
folks,” Young said. “This is an 
annual event for me. It’s intimate 
here. It’s very compact but 
there’s always great support.”

This 
was 
Valerie 
Cook’s 

second year. She is the owner 
of Pink Elephant, a fashion 
accessory 
business 
selling 

chokers, necklaces and earrings. 

“I decided to come again and 

kind of get my brand off the 
ground and see where it takes 
me,” Cook said. “I did my display 
a little bit differently than I did 
last time, and there’s a lot more 
people than there was last time, 
as well.”

Recent 
University 
alums 

Maeva Adoumie and Forrest 
Burnett 
stumbled 
upon 
the 

festival as they were walking 
downtown, interested in the 
food and live music.

“There’s a lot of cool shirts 

that they are selling, so we’ll 
probably check some of that out,” 
Adoumie said.

“There’s a lot of interesting 

Obama memorabilia as well,” 
Burnett added.

Calhoun also explained she 

has seen, firsthand, the way the 
festival has evolved throughout 
the years. She emphasized the 
diversity in attendees, which 
was not always the case.

“It’s 
a 
difference 
in 
the 

culture. We see all cultures 
here today,” Calhoun said. “And 
before when they said ‘African 
American,’ it was mostly Black.

Trump’s withdrawal from Paris Climate Accord 
causes concern among University students, faculty

The US will join 
Nicaragua and 
Syria as the only 
countries excluded 
from the accord

By KAELA THEUT

Summer Daily News Editor

President 
Donald 
J. 
Trump 

announced Thursday that the Unit-
ed States will be leaving the Paris 
Agreement — a treaty signed by 194 
parties across the world to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions — to pre-
serve U.S. jobs.

However, he noted that he was 

open to negotiating the terms of the 
agreement, and finding a deal most 

advantageous to U.S. workers.

“So we’re getting out, but we’ll 

start to negotiate, and we’ll see if we 
can make a deal that’s fair,” Trump 
said.

Throughout his speech, Trump 

commented on how other countries, 
such as China, are trying to take 
advantage of the agreement, and he 
wants to re-establish the notion of 
the United States as a world power.

“At what point do they stop laugh-

ing at us as a country?” he said. “I 
was elected to represent the citizens 
of Pittsburgh, not Paris.”

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Debbie 

Dingell (D–Mich.) called Trump’s 
decision “stunning” and stated 
withdrawing from the agreement 
would only harm the country’s posi-
tion in the world economy.

“This abdication of American 

leadership jeopardizes not only our 

credibility on the world stage, but 
our ability to achieve energy free-
dom and to innovate and compete 
in the new energy economy, costing 
our country the new jobs and busi-
nesses that come with it,” she said.

Dingell also expressed fear for the 

future health and safety of the U.S. 
people, noting the only two coun-
tries not part of the agreement are 
Syria and Nicaragua.

“Joining Nicaragua and Syria 

as the only countries not included 
in the agreement is dangerous and 
shortsighted and will have devas-
tating consequences for the future 
of our planet and the health of our 
people, as well as our national secu-
rity and economic competitiveness,” 
she said. 

LSA junior Amanda Delekta, vice 

president of internal affairs for the 
University of Michigan’s chapter 

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily 

President Trump speaks at a rally during the 2016 presidential campaign. 

of College Republicans, said though 
the agreement is costly for taxpayers, 
she is concerned how withdrawing 
will affect the U.S.’s relationship with 
world allies.

“From an economic standpoint I 

think there are far more crucial ways 
to be spending taxpayer money than 
on the projected costs of the Paris Cli-
mate Agreement,” Delekta said. “How-
ever, I am concerned as to how backing 
out of the deal will affect foreign rela-
tions. I am hoping President Trump 
and his team will be able to act in a way 
that is economically conscious while 
preserving strong relationships with 
American allies.”

Paul Edwards, Professor of History 

and Information and an attendee of 
the 2015 Par is Conference that led to 
the Paris Agreement, echoed Delekta’s 
sentiment and told Michigan News 
that he thinks withdrawing from the 

agreement will cause other countries 
to view the United States in a negative 
light.

“Trump’s choice will not stop the 

world from acting on climate change,” 
he said. “Nor will it do more than delay 
the decarbonization of the U.S. econo-
my, a process already well under way 
due to the simple economics of renew-
able energy costs. Instead, Trump’s 
ignorant decision contributes mainly 
to the rapid decline of America’s repu-
tation. In its place, China and the Euro-
pean Union will now lead the way.”

Chair of College Democrats Rowan 

Conybeare, a Public Policy senior, also 
expressed disappointment toward the 
decision. 

“It is upsetting to learn that, as a 

world leader, the U.S. has pulled out 
of the Paris agreement,” she wrote. 
“It was a necessary, pivotal agreement 
working to combate climate change.”

He then read a passage from his 

book aloud that described former 
President Gerald Ford as always 
seeing the best in people, while it 
was up to his Chief of Staff, Donald 
Rumsfeld, to suspect the worst. In 
one story, Rumsfeld forbid Ford 
from attending the birthday party 
of his friend House Majority Leader 
Tip O’Neill when he heard it was 
hosted by a lobbyist from Korea 
who 
was 
under 
investigation. 

When Ford insisted he attend, 
Rumsfeld said he would have to 
walk there as Rumsfeld would not 
be accompanying him. Ford sent 
his regrets. Said lobbyist was later 
indicted

Whipple compared such action 

to events transpiring currently 
in the White House. He noted 
Trump met with James Comey, 
the former Director of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, to caution 
him of investigating the alleged 
involvement by the state of Russia 
in the 2016 presidential election. 
Trump went on to fire Comey. 

He asked the audience if they 

could imagine such a meeting 
happening under the watch of a 
historically successful Chief of Staff 
such as Jim Baker under former 
President Ronald Reagan or Leon 
Panetta under former President Bill 

Clinton.

“This is just the latest and most 

dramatic example of a president 
who has no one who will tell him 
what he doesn’t want to hear,” he 
said.

Kate Murray, the Special Events 

Coordinator at the library, said 
Whipple came on the library’s 
radar as a bestselling author. David 
Hume 
Kennerly, 
former 
Chief 

Official White House Photographer 
under President Gerald R. Ford, 
who worked with Whipple on the 
documentary, recommended to her 
that he be invited.

Recognizing the large turnout, 

Murray explained Whipple’s work 
is something all attendees can 
understand 
as 
politics 
evolves, 

especially since everybody has heard 
the name of a Chief of Staff, so it 
would be interesting to them to hear 
the stories behind the respective 
names.

“Our audience tends to be 

different ages, and everybody can 
sort of relate to a specific Chief of 
Staff — and there, of course, are many 
during a presidential term,” she said.

Claire Dahl, a retired history 

teacher from Pioneer High School, 
was among the attendees. She said 
she used to bring her Advanced 
Placement classes to the Ford Library 
so students could do research for 
their term papers.

publishing of research.

Highlighting the importance of 

research, Jagsi said published work 
is crucial to science and academia.

“In 2013 to 2014… only 1 in 5 full 

professors were women, 15 percent 
department chairs and 16 percent 
of medical school deans,” she 
said. “Only 12.7 percent of senior 
authors of original research in the 
New England Journal of Medicine, 
Journal of the American Medical 
Association and Annals of Internal 
Medicine combined in 2004 were 
women.”

 Focusing on the underlying 

causes 
and 
corresponding 

interventions, Jagsi also spoke of 
many factors, including differences 
between men and women in labor 
relations, conscious and unconscious 
biases and the disproportionate 
impacts that child rearing has on 
women’s careers.

“These differences accumulate 

over time and concrete, targeted 
interventions are required,” Jagsi 
said.

She added mentorship and the 

institution of double-blind peer 
reviewing as examples of possible

Edited and managed by students at 

the University of Michigan since 1890.

Yet these bills go beyond our 

campus policies, by limiting 
speech that not only constitutes 
as harassment or hate speech, 
but also punishes speech that 
infringes upon the rights of 
individuals to engage or listen 
to a speaker. Nowhere in the 
constitution is the right to 
listen to a speech classified as 
freedom of speech. We should 
not allow the state government 
to 
impose 
additional 

restrictions on expression and 
assembly.

The University has clearly 

expressed that it values free 
speech. 
For 
instance, 
the 

University refused to censor 
bigoted speech when the school 
did not erase the anti-Islam 
chalk messages along the Diag, 
and has continued to reaffirm 
its commitment to free speech 
after racially charged fliers 
were found in Mason and Haven 
Hall in September. Addressing 
these 
instances 
when 
they 

happen puts the University in a 
difficult position, as it is clear 
that the University wants to 
create an inclusive environment 
but must protect free speech. In 
an attempt to demonstrate the 
University’s openness to debate 
and 
reasonable 
dialogue, 

the 
University 
allowed 

controversial 
conservative 

figure Milo Yiannopoulos to 
speak on our campus, despite 
negative 
feedback 
from 

students.

After instances like these 

occur on campus, however, 
administrators 
must 
uphold 

their values of tolerance and 
inclusivity 
to 
protect 
the 

protesters right to assemble, 
by listening to students who 
feel outraged by the substance 
of a debate or speech, and who 

organize to express themselves. 
Symbolically 
standing 
in 

solidarity with these students 
will accomplish few tangible 
goals. Students who find that 
they must defend themselves 
against bigoted speech should 
be given the space to do so. 
By the same logic, counter-
protests are also free speech, 
and need to be protected. 

Finally, 
accusations 
of 

infringements 
upon 
speech 

against students will create 
unnecessary costs on taxpayers, 
with court costs and attorney 
fees needing to be met by the 
state government when brought 
against student protesters. Not 
only would the implication of 
the bills be unjust, they would 
create unnecessary financial 
burdens on taxpayers — who 
we hope will refuse to tolerate 
these laws.

When the state government 

create 
laws 
that 
censor 

students, they are justifying 
these sanctions by arguing 
that students are infringing 
upon speech when they shut 
down speakers or try to remove 
offensive 
class 
material. 

However, the Editorial Board 
believes that this is simply 
a 
hypocritical 
attempt 
by 

the 
state 
government 
to 

restrict the right of students. 
We 
need 
to 
safeguard 

students’ rights to freedom 
of expression, and freedom 
from oppressive institutions. 
The core principles of free 
thought should be upheld by 
the University, for the sake of 
students — not just speakers.

FROM THE DAILY

Protect free speech for student protesters
E

arly in May, Michigan state senators introduced two free speech bills to the Mich-
igan legislature: Senate Bill 349, entitled the “Campus Free Speech Act,” and Sen-
ate Bill 350. If Senate Bill 349 passes, any public institution of higher education in 

the state, will have the authority to restrict peaceful assembly on their campus — as long as 
the restrictions meet certain requirements for interference. The second bill, Senate Bill 350, 
adds an amendment to “The State School Aid Act of 1979,” allowing any public institution 
of higher education in the state, to restrict expressive conduct, including peaceful assembly, 
protest, speech, distribution of fliers on campuses, signing petitions and holding signs.
T

hewse bills would inhibit 
campus-wide expression 
on campuses and punish 

students who are accused of 
infringing upon others’ right to 
listen to a speaker or accused 
of 
disrupting 
the 
college’s 

functions. In order to protect 
students’ civil liberties, and 
by extension, the social causes 
protesters are advocating on 
behalf of, the Editorial Board 
urges 
Michigan 
residents 

and students to oppose this 
imprudent bill. 

Michigan 
state 
senator 

Patrick 
Colbeck 
was 
the 

primary writer of the bill, along 
with nine other Republican 
state 
senators. 
In 
a 
press 

release, Colbeck explains that 
the purpose of the bills is to 
protect speakers from having 
their right to speech subverted 
by 
student 
protesters. 

However, if universities and 
community colleges carry out 
these rules, they must realize 
that their authority has the 
potential 
to 
stifle 
student 

activism. Expulsion is not a 
punishment to be taken lightly; 
students should not fear the 
repercussions 
of 
assembling 

peacefully on their campuses 
— a basic constitutional right. 
Furthermore, the University 
needs to be aware of who 

they are giving a platform to 
speak and who is hurt as a 
consequence. Of course, the 
right to express new ideas and 
engage in open, intellectual 
dialogue is crucial to students’ 
academic growth, but when 
speakers espouse ideas that 
dehumanize 
or 
demean 

individuals on the basis of their 
identities, students should have 
the right to voice and organize 
their concerns.

The 
Editorial 
Board 
has 

several 
concerns 
with 
the 

proposed 
legislation. 
First, 

the vague phrasing of the bills 
and overly broad restrictions 
on University censorship is 
troubling. 
The 
legislation 

grants 
public 
colleges 
too 

much authority to discern what 
constitutes as an infringement 
upon speech, allowing colleges 
to 
decide 
for 
themselves 

whether students are disrupting 
the school’s function, and can 
sanction these students.

The 
state 
legislature 

shouldn’t merely change the 
wording of the bills to make 
them 
more 
palatable, 
they 

should not allow the bills to 
pass at all. Restrictions on free 
speech must remain within the 
limits of the First Amendment, 
anything more would violate 
students’ 
civil 
liberties. 

Moreover, as student protests 
become more prominent — and 
necessary — throughout the 
country, it is vital that students, 
school 
administrators, 

universities 
and 
community 

colleges remain vigilant over 
actions taken by the state 
and 
federal 
government 
to 

limit 
speech. 
For 
instance, 

students 
at 
the 
University 

have expressed opposition to, 
and ultimately helped cancel, 
a debate over the Black Lives 
Matter Movement. But, these 
protests 
did 
not 
infringe 

upon the free speech rights of 
speakers who protesters were 
organizing against, and should 
not, in future cases like this, be 
punished.

Though 
nationally 
there 

have 
been 
instances 
where 

protesters have become violent, 
protests held by students at the 
University do not warrant this 
punishment. Our campus, and

OPINION

Thursday, June 8, 2017

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

T

here are approximately 
7.5 
billion 
people 
in 

the world at this very 

moment, and each of us are 
distinctly different. That means 
there are 7.5 billion different 
fingerprints, or chromosomal 
sets — billions of bodies with 
unique 
faces, 
minds 
and 

movements. 
That 
reflects 

billions of connections, ways to 
communicate — billions of ways 
to live, feel and love.

Billions of moments and 

memories 
that 
make 
up 

identities 
and 
experiences. 

That also means there are 
billions of ways to hurt and 
cause pain. Billions of ways 
to divide, hate and fear. There 
are billions of ways to detach 
and 
ultimately 
billions 
of 

ways we can separate from 
each other.

What do we see when we 

look at one another? Is it just 
physical? Like skin color, hair 
texture and body type? Or 
the clothing we wear? Maybe 
it is more than that? Do we 
ever look beyond the surface 
and discover the languages 
and dialects we use? Where 
we come from? How we got 
here? Do we see the beauty 
of 
the 
individual? 
Do 
we 

acknowledge 
our 
various 

intellects? Experiences? Can 
we embrace our differences? 
Or 
will 
we 
continue 
to 

weaponize them, ultimately 
militarizing our very bodies, 
violating and exploiting not 
only our own character, but 
our environment as well. In a 
more general sense, what can 
we possibly gain from tearing 
each other apart?

I pondered these questions 

a few days after I reflected 
upon the tragic incidents which 
occurred in Manchester last 
week. My thought process was 
the following: First, it was 
accepting that the victims of 
this merciless killing were 22 
innocent young people, not 
much younger nor older than 
myself, some of which were 
attending their first concert 
by themselves. Next, it was 
coming to the realization that 
a current pop culture icon like 
Ariana Grande, whom millions 
have grown up watching on 
Nickelodeon and idolize, would 
be targeted and attacked.

Typically, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 

become so far removed from 

acts 
of 
terror. 
Treacherous 

occurrences happen thousands 
of miles away, across oceans, 
involving 
people 
we 
have 

never seen nor known. We 
feel pity, sadness, uncertainty 
— and then as quickly as we 
were shaken by the tragedy, 
we move on, distracted by the 
normalcy of our own lives, 
forgetting about the ruin those 
affected now find themselves 
in. Manchester cannot be one 
of those instances. So I wonder, 
what happens now? Fear? 
Mayhem? Hate? I think we can 
look to history to validate each 
of these conclusions. 

It is no secret that as acts 

of terrorism rapidly infect the 
globe, xenophobia follows in 

its wake. Xenophobia is defined 
as, 
“intense 
or 
irrational 

dislike or fear of people from 
other countries or cultures.” 
Following the rise of the jihadist 
group Islamic State in Iraq and 
Syria in 2014, xenophobia most 
often appears in the form of, “a 
dislike of, or prejudice against 
Islam or Muslims, especially 
as a political force,” otherwise 
known as Islamophobia. We 
see this in the spike of hate 
crimes and anti-Muslim groups 
following 9/11, and even in our 
political 
culture. 
As 
recent 

as January, when President 
Trump’s 
executive 
order 

attempted to ban immigrants 
and 
refugees 
from 
several 

Muslim-majority 
countries 

from entering the United States. 
It is interesting to note that 
even the President of the United 
States ran a campaign centered 
on rhetoric instilling the fear 
of our differences and now has 
taken executive action to keep 
us divided and isolated from 
others. The latest FBI’s annual 
Hate Crime Statistics report, 
shows that anti-Muslim hate 
crimes have risen 67 percent, 
totaling 257 reported instances 

in 2015. According to the Pew 
Research Center analysis, that 
is the highest number since the 
al-Queda attacks on New York 
City and elsewhere in 2001. In 
recent years, we have seen this 
statistical trend demonstrated 
at the University as various 
Islamophobic incidents have 
occurred. For example, the 
anti-Muslim chalking on the 
Diag, or even more recently, 
the defiling of a prayer rug in 
the 
Shapiro 
Undergraduate 

Library — both of which gained 
national 
attention, 
spurring 

the involvement of the FBI. 
Last 
year, 
The 
Michigan 

Daily even published a piece 
entitled, “Muslim students say 
Islamophobia is frequent and 
underreported 
on 
campus.” 

We act cruelly and violently 
against each other, even on our 
own campus.

Just a few days ago, in 

Portland, Oregon, two men 
were fatally stabbed by a 
man who they confronted for 
yelling racist comments at two 
teenage girls on a commuter 
train. One of the girls was 
Black 
and 
the 
other 
was 

Muslim and wearing a hijab. 
These men, now identified as 
Ricky John Best and Taliesin 
Myrddin 
Namkai-Meche, 

have been labeled as heroes 
for their courageous actions. 
Given 
current 
undertones 

of today’s society, some may 
be lead to believe that it is 
acceptable to victimize people 
for their differences; however, 
these two men obviously did 
not share the same sentiment. 
They 
acted 
powerfully 
by 

countering this, thus standing 
up 
for 
their 
convictions 

and ultimately showing the 
world how things should be. 
Unfortunately, these men had 
to sacrifice their lives in order 
to do it.

There are approximately 7.5 

billion people in the world at 
this very moment, and each 
of us are distinctly different. 
However, our differences lie 
in how we view them. With 
all of this being said, I’ll ask 
again.

What do we see when we look 

at one another?

What do you see?

Our eyes
Promoting racial equity through sustainability
W 

hile 
there 
are 

improvements to be 
made with race-based 

issues on campus, there is no 
question that the University is 
committed to making strides 
toward racial equity. This is 
evident through the Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion (DEI) 
initiative implemented in 2015. 
The DEI is at the forefront of 
the University’s agenda — and 
personally I think for good 
reason. This being said, the DEI 
should not be the only way we 
address racial inequality at the 
University.

While it may not be obvious, 

the importance of addressing 
racial inequality is especially 
true 
when 
evaluating 
the 

sustainability 
initiatives 
put 

forth by the University. Clearly, 
environmentalism 
is 
critical 

to the health of the planet — 
which is already important. 
However, 
environmentalism’s 

pertinence to racial inequality 
makes it even more significant. 
And, 
considering 
the 

federal government’s lack of 
commitment to green efforts, 
sustainability should not be 
placed on the back-burner.

The Trump administration 

began 
by 
expunging 
all 

references to climate change 
from the official White House 
website. Then, the President’s 
budget 
proposed 
that 
the 

Environmental 
Protection 

Agency’s 
(EPA) 
funding 
be 

reduced 
31 
percent. 
Trump 

also ordered a review on the 
auto-industry’s fuel emission 
standards set by the Obama 
administration, 
essentially 

striking a deal already set in 
place. This week, the President 
determined that the United 
States will withdraw from the 
Paris Climate Accord, in which 
the United States pledged to 
lower its annual greenhouse 
emissions 26 to 28 percent below 
2005 levels by 2025.

It is ample clear from these 

examples 
that 
the 
Trump 

administration does not have an 
agenda that contributes to the 
nation’s sustainability efforts. In 
fact, budget cuts to the Region 
5 EPA office (which serves 
Michigan and several other 
Midwest states) and persistent 
rumors of its closing suggest that 
Michigan will not have federal 
help fighting the battle against 

climate change. Therefore, it’s 
more important than ever that 
the University and its students 
put sustainability efforts at a 
priority.

Furthermore, as an institution 

committed to remedying racial 
disparities, it is essential that 
the University — and the state 
— care about climate change. 
Climate change, pollution and 
other 
environmental 
issues 

disproportionately 
affect 

minorities and the poor in the 
United States. Those who live 
in poorer areas are more likely 
to breathe dirtier air, and less 
likely to have health insurance 
to fight against the damaging 
effects it produces. According to 
a 2009 University of California 
study in Los Angeles, African 
Americans were twice as likely 
as others to die in a heatwave. 
Additionally, climate change has 
disastrous effects on the labor 
and supervisor sector, which is 
largely comprised of Hispanic 
employees. In a case study I did 
on Long Beach, Calif., examining 
the I-710 freeway corridor and 
the Port of Long Beach, the 
negative environmental effects 
of these two issues were largely 
taken 
by 
disproportionately 

impacted poor minorities.

Even 
the 
environmental 

catastrophe 
amplified 
by 

government negligence in Flint 
clearly targeted minorities. If 
there had been more resources 
committed to environmental 
justice, Flint may have had safer 
environmental conditions.

If we as a University care 

about racial progress, we also 
need to care about sustainability 
and 
climate 
change. 
The 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Initiative is critical, but it is 
important more than ever that 
sustainability initiatives work 
in tandem to it. Not only does it 
address an issue our government 
fails to prioritize, it improves 
some racial inequalities DEI 
looks to address.

If you care about the planet 

and its future, you should 
support increased sustainability 
efforts at the University. And 
while it may be less obvious, 
if you care racial equity, it 
is important you care about 
sustainability.

Boston Calling: a festival representing 
a diverse adoration of music and comedy

By DOM POLSINELLI

Summer Senior Arts Editor

Walking into new music festivals 

can be scary. It can also be adventur-
ous. In the case of Boston Calling, it 
was a combination of the two. Trav-
eling from the “Harvard of the West” 
(the University) to the actual Har-
vard, I packed up my bags and pre-
pared to survive a few days in foreign 
territory.

After surviving a rather rough 

“Emo Night” at the Sinclair in Cam-
bridge the night before (I literally 
almost lost my voice when “Came 
Out Swinging” came on), I made 
my way to Harvard’s Athletic Com-
plex around midday on Friday to see 
Vundabar open the festival.

My friends and I made our way 

to some barricade spots as fans 
sprinted into the festival to join the 
crowd. It was quite a culture shock 
to see Vundabar — who I recently 
saw perform in the basement of local 
DIY space, Lincoln House — take the 
comparatively massive stage in front 
of exponentially more people. Yet, the 
band didn’t disappoint in the drasti-
cally different setting, maintaining 
the charisma, charm and humor that 
marked their performance in Ann 
Arbor. With their set full of rock-
ing jams, Boston Calling was off to a 
great start, clearly noted in the smil-
ing faces of those walking away from 
the stage.

Later that day — staying true to 

my brand by staying with the rock 
acts — I caught Car Seat Headrest’s 
set, consisting of their typically long 

songs and a Devo cover. The band 
pleased the hefty crowd by sticking 
to fan favorites like “Drunk Drivers/
Killer Whales” and “Destroyed by 
Hippie Powers,” and during “Fill in 
the Blank,” the entire crowd enthu-
siastically echoed the chorus, “You 
have no right to be depressed / you 
haven’t tried hard enough to like it.” 
Frontman Will Toledo crooned every 
note well enough to distract from the 
band’s rather bland indie rock, trans-
forming their boring recorded tunes 
into fun-filled sing-alongs live.

Next up was Mac Demarco, whose 

usual dreamy set was smoothly 
accentuated with material off his 
recent album This Old Dog. The crowd 
sang and swayed as Mac smoked and 
grooved, at one point even pulling a 
fan onstage to dance due to the fan’s 
“I skipped my prom today” sign. Dur-
ing his hour long set, I watched Mac 
Demarco sing, crowd surf and be 
showered with packs of cigarettes 
from his adoring fans to the delight 
of the crowd. Neither stunning nor 
stagnant, Mac delivered a neutral, 
pleasant set to the festival goers.

Unfortunately, my time listening to 

Bon Iver’s gorgeous set was cut short 
by the drunken (and incredibly loud) 
masses piling up to the neighboring 
stage to prepare for Chance The Rap-
per. Chance, however, made up for 
this misfortune by riding — yes, I said 
riding — out on a motorcycle. Despite 
his Coloring Book-heavy set (I’m par-
tial to Acid Rap, but I digress), he has 
an infectious stage presence. To no 
surprise, Francis (of Francis and the 
Lights) came out to perform “May I 

Have This Dance,” and his synchro-
nized choreography with Chance 
was a fantastic highlight to polish off 
the first day of the festival.

Saturday was a much more relaxed 

day in the lineup, although I started 
my 
festival 
activities 
watching 

Detroit’s very own hip-hop phenom 
Danny Brown in a rowdy crowd. The 
pit exploded in a hilarious mix of frat 
bros in Vineyard Vines and punk kids 
in band tees, all jamming to Brown’s 
infectious brand of rap. The crowd 
responded in full force when Brown 
began the deep cut (and arguably his 
best song) “Ain’t it Funny” from his 
most recent record Atrocity Exhibi-
tion as deep bass and piercing notes 
pulsated over the attendees.

An hour later, I decided to check 

out the “Comedy Arena” of the festi-
val, located inside Harvard’s hockey 
rink. I watched a string of comedians 
deliver some funny bits, leading up 
to Hannibal Buress’s time on stage. 
Phoebe Robinson had the crowd 
either cracking up or appalled with a 
story about vomiting during a sexual 
encounter. Unfortunately, most of the 
crowd was more concerned with 
sitting down and chatting indoors 
than the comedy itself, but Buress 
produced some hysterical segments, 
especially one concerning the plan-
ning of his own funeral.

To round out the music for the eve-

ning, I opted to go see The 1975 (one 
of my favorite bands to hate) over The 
xx due to the fact that I saw them ear-
lier this month. To my dismay, The 
1975 deliver in performance, and the 
crowd around me lacked the stereo-
typical intensity (or better yet, insan-
ity) of the band’s fans to my delight. 
They carried a lovely ambiance — 
even during their dull music — and 
they had the crowd jumping to the 
beat during their best hits like “Sex” 
and “The Sound.”

Sunday was the most taxing day 

for the punk and rock fans — especial-
ly while trying to weave through the 
crowds of metalheads only attend-
ing Sunday for the almighty Tool. 
The Hotelier and PUP opened up the 
last day of the festival, and both gave 
fantastic 
performances 
consider-

ing their usual concert dwellings are 
intimate clubs. The Hotelier — whose 
lengthy tracks are far better experi-
enced when they have more than 30 
minutes to impress — made their way 
through a mix of their old and new 

material to the delight of the notice-
ably punker crowd before giving way 
to PUP.

PUP absolutely crushed their set, 

slamming through 10 songs in barely 
over half an hour. The crowd in the 
pit threw each other and surfed over 
bodies embodying the frenzy of the 
band’s tunes. Others smiled and sang 
along to the anthemic punk rock, and 
I couldn’t find a single member of the 
audience who wasn’t loving the per-
formance.

In an interview, the band and I 

talked about what it means to move 
from basements and clubs to festi-
val stages and playing festivals with 
diverse artists and crowds.

“Festivals are a different beast for 

sure. You get to play to a lot more peo-
ple than you normally would, and you 
kind of get to play to a bunch of people 
who don’t know you — so that’s cool. 
There’s definitely a sort of spark that 
comes with playing in a dirty, packed 
basement. It’s just a different show. 
It’s a different vibe… It’s kind of nice 
to get to do both,” said Stefan Bab-
cock, guitarist and lead singer of the 
group.

According to Babcock, the crowds 

have been showing them the passion 
they’ve grown to expect from their 
basement roots as they’ve acclimated 
to the big stages at summer festivals. 

“It’s cool. It’s been surprisingly 

rad… as things have progressed for 
us, they’ve become more and more 
fun. So we’ve definitely warmed up 
to the sort of festival atmosphere,” he 
said.

The band also talked about the 

welcome diversity of artists seen at 

a festival, especially one as rounded 
as Boston Calling. The band clearly 
pulls influence and inspiration from a 
wide range of acts spanning multiple 
genres.

“Selfishly, I feel like festivals are 

fun because you get to see a lot of 
bands that you otherwise would be 
paying a lot of money to see. There’s a 
big collection of stuff that goes across 
genres,” said guitarist Steve Slad-
kowski.

The band listed Weezer, Hotelier, 

Tool and Run The Jewels as some of 
the artists they were most excited 
about seeing that day, and they 
even mentioned looking forward to 
Hannibal Buress’s continued com-
edy performance later in the day.

After seeing Mitski, Run The 

Jewels and even a bit of the almighty 
Tool (whose rather aggressive use 
of the word “snowflake” was off-
putting at the least), I concluded 
that Boston Calling is the perfect 
festival for niche fans. Those who 
love music for the sake of it, looking 
beyond mainstream consumption. 
Standing in a crowd wholeheart-
edly singing along with Mitski to 
“Your Best American Girl” and then 
immediately witnessing the smiles 
in the pit during Run The Jewels 
felt like a testament to a crowd that 
existed beyond needing an excuse 
to drink and dance — they attended 
the festival to check out prolific up-
and-coming geniuses like PUP per-
form alongside established musical 
giants like Chance and Tool. If any-
thing, Boston Calling is a festival 
constructed from the ground up for 
the adoration of music.

“We don’t submit to terror. We 

make the terror.”

Those were the ominous words 

that “House of Cards” left us with at 
the end of its gripping Season Four 
finale. After four years of witnessing 
Frank (Kevin Spacey, “American 
Beauty”) and Claire Underwood 
(Robin Wright, “Forrest Gump”) 
conspire, deceive and murder their 
way to the White House, audiences 
were inclined to believe Frank’s 
fateful line. In “House of Cards”’s 
newest season, the Underwoods 
more than fulfill their vow to 
inspire fear. Picking up right where 
Season Four ended, the Season Five 
premiere documents Frank’s brutal 
re-election campaign and attempt 
to obstruct a Congressional inves-
tigation 
into 

his scheme to 
usurp the presi-
dency. “House 
of Cards” has 
seemingly 
learned 
from 

some 
of 
its 

Season 
Three 

struggles 
and 

realized that its 
ideal show emerges when the focus 
is shifted away from simply show-
ing policymaking occurring.

The hype surrounding this lat-

est “House of Cards” season has 
been building for some time, espe-
cially with this new season pre-
miering three months later than 
the series’s traditional release date 
in February. The show recognizes 
and exploits this fervor attached 
to the show, opening with a bang 
in the form of a breathtaking scene 
in which Frank unexpectedly vis-
its Congress, demanding that they 
declare war on the Islamic Caliph-
ate 
Organization. 
Repeatedly 

shouting “I don’t care,” Frank’s 
bold, fiery rhetoric sets the tone for 
a conflict-oriented season.

The success of this most recent 

“House of Cards” season is largely 
a result of its continued reliance on a 
talented and diverse cast. One of the 
hallmarks of the show has always 
been Spacey and Wright’s emotion-
ally-charged performances, and 
both live up to the massive bar they 
have established. Beyond the two 
main stars, Joel Kinnaman’s (“Easy 
Money”) increased role as Will 
Conway has allowed him to high-
light his range. This season also sees 
the return of the enigmatic Mal-

colm Madera (“Sobrevivo”) from 
Season Two. Elsewhere, “House 
of Cards”’s vets Michael Kelly 
(“Changeling”) and Paul Sparks 
(“Boardwalk Empire”) remain as 
strong and steady as ever.

For as much as the series appears 

to have corrected some of its past 
missteps, this newest season still 
struggles with its pacing. Even 
after “House of Cards” dedicated 
the second half of Season Four to 
Frank’s re-election campaign, the 
show does not give audiences the 
actual election until three episodes 
into this latest season. The series 
entirely reverses its gradual course 
soon after that by implementing a 
nine-week gap between two cru-
cial episodes. It’s this type of incon-
sistent pacing that baffles viewers 
and leaves them playing catch-up at 
times.

Despite its erratic pac-

ing, “House of Cards”’s lat-
est season remains deftly 
produced, with its camera 
work particularly strong. 
The series continues to 
heavily feature effective 
wide frame shots and bring 
viewers into the action 
through numerous close-
up scenes. Beyond these 

shots, “House of Cards”’s most 
recent season exposes audiences to 
more Capitol Hill landmarks, with 
gorgeous, sweeping scenes at the 
Washington Monument and the 
Jefferson Memorial.

Beyond its outstanding cinema-

tography, “House of Cards”’s latest 
season also benefits from a larger 
role for Claire. Claire’s path to 
power has been slowly building over 
the course of the series, and Season 
Five continues to explore the First 
Lady’s 
presidential 
aspirations. 

With her ruthlessness now match-
ing Frank’s, and possibly exceeding 
it, Claire appears bent on following 
a similar path of deception as Frank 
to obtain the Oval Office. In one 
especially tense scene, Claire’s cal-
lous, vindictive nature resurfaces, 
as she chillingly tells Vice President 
Donald Blythe (Reed Birney, “The 
Blacklist”), “You’re a fool, Donald. 
You always were. You and your 
dumb dead wife that you never, ever 
shut up about.”

With her ever-increasing role 

in “House of Cards,” Claire seems 
bound for her own presidential bid 
in the not-so-distant future. For 
now, however, enjoy the excellent 
bit of controlled chaos that is the 
fifth season of “House of Cards.”

University receives prestigious grant for research

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

The University of Michigan 

announced Wednesday it was 
awarded a $58 million grant 
from the National Institute of 
Health to fund medical research 
— the largest grant of its kind the 

University has received.

The grant, provided by the NIH’s 

National Center for Advancing 
Translational Sciences through 
its 
Clinical 
and 
Translational 

Sciences Awards program, will 
go directly to the University’s 
Michigan Institute for Clinical 
Health and Research. 

MICHR 
Director 
George 

Mashour said compared to other 
grants received by the University 
this one is “several orders of 
magnitude higher.”

Translational science is the 

process of taking the results 
of 
laboratory 
work, 
known 

as 
foundational 
science, 
and 

transferring its information to a 
useful application, like fighting 
a disease. In addition to other 
services, the MICHR facilitates and 
provides training for this clinical 
research. Mashour emphasized 
just how essential this grant and 
the grant-awarding process in 
general are to the MICHR’s work.

“This NIH grant really forms 

the basis of our institute’s work,” 
he said. “If we didn’t have it, 
it would be extremely difficult 
and extremely expensive for the 
institution to help support all 
the services that we offer. Unlike 
other institutes, we’re not doing 
the research itself. We don’t have 
a specific disease in mind, like the 
Cancer Center or the Depression 
Center. We’re really here to be the 
tide that helps all boats rise.”

Engineering 
junior 
Natalie 

Baxter, who is an undergraduate 
research 
in 
the 
Shea 
Lab 

investigating 
cancer 
initiation, 

agreed, saying smaller divisions 
like hers appreciated the grant 
money.

“Working in a lab has given 

me insight to how much time and 
money goes into each project,” 
she said. “The research team in 
my lab is working really hard to 
find breakthroughs in research on 
several medical challenges. A lot of 
obstacles need to be overcome just 
to turn an idea into an experiment 
and eventually a clinical trial, 
so it’s reassuring to see that big 
organizations 
are 
willing 
to 

invest so much in research at the 
University of Michigan.”

In a press release from the 

University, 
Vicki 
Ellingrod, 

associate director of MICHR, 
leader of its education team 
and associate dean for research 
and education in the College of 
Pharmacy, said in addition to 
aiding the many programs and 
studies the MICHR services, the 
grant would help the MICHR 
expand its own programs.

“The new grant will allow 

us to expand some of our most 
successful training programs in 
translational research and develop 
new ones,” she said. “Perhaps 
what is most exciting about our 
new grant is that we will now be 
able to work more directly with 
patients, 
research 
participants 

and groups within the community, 
and learn how to guide research 
in collaboration with our MICHR 
scholars.”

The University is one of over 50 

institutes funded by the NIH to 
promote translational science and 
research. According to Mashour, 

the grant will allow the University 
to connect more effectively with 
other such institutions.

“Traditionally, these institutes 

are 
really 
focused 
more 
on 

their institution, they’re doing 
great work, they’re doing some 
collaboration together, but they 
weren’t really functioning as a 
full network,” he said. “And where 
we’re moving now, in this exciting 
phase at the national level, is 
really to try to link up all of these 
institutes and come to common 
agreements, 
related 
to, 
say, 

regulatory affairs or approaches 
to conducting clinical research, 
and try to leverage the whole 
nation.”

In addition to the medical 

researchers and patients who 
will feel the positive effects of 
the grant, so will students like 
LSA 
senior 
Brennan 
Munley, 

who participates in research at 
the University’s Comprehensive 
Cancer Center.

“It definitely helps me out, in 

the way that it’s gonna provide 
clinical jobs, and ways to get 
experience and just to get into 
the 
hospital, 
and 
get 
some 

experience,” he said. “It’ll help me 
on my long-term path, whether 
I go to med school or PA school 
or pharmacy school, whatever I 
decide to do, it’ll definitely help 
me get in some experience.”

It’s reassuring 
to see that big 

organizations are 
willing to invest so 
much in research

Michigan drops tournament opener

With the score tied, 5-5, with 

two runners on and two outs in the 
sixth inning, Michigan senior right-
hander Mac Lozer took the mound 
to face Florida Gulf Coast first 
baseman Nick Rivera.

In this potential game-changing 

moment, it was strength vs. strength 
— Lozer with his miniscule 0.70 
earned-run 
average 
and 
.134 

opponent batting average, against 
Rivera, who had hit his 18th home 
run of the season in the previous 
inning.

But Rivera showed why he was 

named the ASUN Player of the Year, 
launching Lozer’s third pitch off the 
scoreboard in left field for a three-
run home run.

Rivera’s blast gave the Eagles (43-

18 overall, 1-0 postseason) a lead they 
would not relinquish on their way to 
a 10-6 win over the Wolverines (42-
16, 0-1) in the first game of the NCAA 
Tournament’s Chapel Hill Regional.

After its disappointing run in 

the Big Ten Tournament last week, 
Michigan got off to a nearly perfect 
start. On a hot, muggy afternoon, 
Florida Gulf Coast right-hander 
Kutter Crawford was forced to throw 
38 pitches just to get out of the first 
inning, due in large part to crucial 
defensive errors. The Wolverines 
collected only one hit in the frame — 
an RBI single by redshirt sophomore 
left-fielder Miles Lewis — but two 
walks, a catcher’s interference and a 
botched rundown play allowed them 
to take an early 2-0 lead.

Michigan 
left-hander 
Oliver 

Jaskie’s first inning was the polar 
opposite of Crawford’s, however — 
He threw just 12 pitches and struck 
out two to send the Eagles back to 
the field.

The Wolverines scored in a more 

conventional 
manner 
the 
next 

inning. With two outs, senior center-
fielder Johnny Slater sat on a 3-1 pitch 
and drilled it to deep centerfield, his 
fifth home run of the season putting 
Michigan up by three.

Florida Gulf Coast responded 

quickly to begin to chip away at 
the early deficit, however. Second 
baseman Jake Smith poked a two-
out RBI single into left field, and in 
the fourth inning, three consecutive 
two-out 
singles 
brought 
home 

another run.

The game became a back-and-

forth contest starting with the 
Eagles’ half of the fourth inning. 
Michigan chased Crawford from the 
game with an RBI single from third 
baseman Drew Lugbauer, but Rivera 
crushed a home run on a full count 
to keep the margin at one run.

After senior shortstop Michael 

Brdar pushed Michigan’s lead back 
to two runs with a double to right 
field, Florida Gulf Coast fought back 
against Jaskie. After two straight 
groundouts, Smith laced a triple 
down the right-field line, and scored 
when Lugbauer was unable to corral 
catcher Spencer Levine’s hard-hit 
grounder.

Shortstop Julio Gonzalez then 

scratched out an infield base hit, 
and centerfielder Gage Morey tied 
the game with a bouncing ball into 

centerfield. This last base hit ended 
Jaskie’s outing, and set the table for 
Rivera — who proceeded to do what 
he does best with his deep drive to 
left.

The Wolverines bounced back in 

the seventh inning. Three straight 
two-out singles by the bottom of the 
order made it a two-run contest. But 
Eagles closer Kenton Hering entered 
the game to induce a groundout and 
end the threat.

Junior Alec Rennard took the 

mound in the eighth inning with 
Michigan still very much in striking 
distance. But again with two 
outs, Florida Gulf Coast wouldn’t 
go away. With two runners on, 
Rennard decided not to give Rivera 
an opportunity to put the game out 
of reach. But the intentional walk to 
the Eagle slugger came back to cost 
the Wolverines as third baseman 
Richie Garcia singled to right field to 
drive in two more runs.

Hering would go the distance for 

Florida Gulf Coast. Despite putting 
two runners aboard in the ninth, 
he retired Thomas for the second 
time on a game-ending groundout to 
third base.

The contest was marked by two-

out RBIs — in fact, both teams’ 
scoring plays in the fifth inning were 
the only runs scored with less than 
two outs in the entire game. The 
Wolverines were 8-for-17 with five 
RBIs when batting with two outs.

However, the Eagles were even 

better — hitting 11-18 and driving 
in nine runs in such situations. And 
they would use this to blow the game 
open in the sixth inning.

Wolverines compete at 
NCAA Championships

At 
the 
NCAA 
Preliminary 

Rounds in Lexington, Ky. from 
May 25-27, the Michigan track 
and field teams qualified five men 
and three women to represent the 
Wolverines at this week’s NCAA 
Championships. 

The 
men’s 
championships 

began Wednesday and are set 
to continue Friday, while the 
women’s events are scheduled for 
Thursday and Saturday.

The men’s team has been 

powered all season long by its 
deep group of throwers, and 
this continued at the NCAA 
Championships. 
Sophomore 

Joe Ellis finished 17th in the 
hammer throw in his national 
championship debut last season, 
and won the Big Ten Outdoor 
Championship with a Michigan 
program-record throw of 70.98 
meters. Wednesday, he improved 
upon that finish with a throw of 
70.33 meters to place eighth.

Junior 
shot-putters 
Grant 

Cartwright, a First-Team All-
American 
during 
the 
indoor 

season, and freshman Andrew 
Liskowitz, 
who 
finished 

third at the conference meet, 
both qualified for the NCAA 
Championships 
for 
the 
first 

time at the preliminary meet. 
Cartwright and Liskowitz earned 
Honorable Mention All-American 
honors with their 22nd and 23rd 
place finishes, respectively.

Senior Steven Bastien, the Big Ten 

Champion in the decathlon, currently 
sits in fourth place in the decathlon 
standings after Wednesday’s first five 
events, with the competition set to 
conclude Thursday.

The 
Wolverines 
are 
also 

represented by sophomore Taylor 
McLaughlin, who competed in the 
400-meter hurdles. However, his 
season-best time of 50.18 seconds 
was not enough to advance past 
the semifinals.

The 
women’s 
team 
is 

represented by a strong distance 
contingent consisting of senior 
Gina Sereno and juniors Jaimie 
Phelan and Claire Borchers.

Phelan used a scorching final 

lap to win the Big Ten title in the 
1,500 meter run on May 14. She will 
take the track first for Michigan 
Thursday in the semifinal heat of 
that event, and attempt to qualify 
for the final Saturday.

Borchers 
barely 
missed 

qualifying 
for 
the 
national 

championships last season in the 
3,000-meter steeplechase, finishing 
13th in the preliminary round. This 
year, she won her heat in Lexington 
to advance to the national meet, 
following up her second-place finish 
at the conference championships.

At the Big Ten Championships 

last month, Sereno became just 
the third woman in history to win 
both the 5,000 meters and 10,000 
meters in consecutive seasons. 
Unbeaten this outdoor season, she 
will compete Saturday night in the 
5,000, her only event.

Michigan Baseball 2017 Season In Review

The Michigan baseball team 

won 42 games, finished second in 
the Big Ten and qualified for the 
NCAA Tournament for the second 
time in five seasons under coach 
Erik Bakich. But while the ending 
was different from last year’s, as the 
Wolverines achieved their goal of 
making the postseason, it still left a 
sour taste in their mouths. Michigan 
dropped its last four games of the 
season, including two late-inning 
heartbreakers 
in 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament and two straight in the 
Chapel Hill Regional. Regardless, 
the Wolverines were dominant 
much of the season, including a 
14-1 stretch in April, possessed the 
Big Ten’s top scoring offense and 
top pitching staff and maintained a 
national ranking for most of the year, 
reaching as high as 13th.

The 
Daily 
looks 
back 
on 

Michigan’s winningest season since 
2008, and offers season superlatives 
as well as a look ahead to 2018.

Most Valuable Player: Michael 

Brdar

Ako Thomas was hitting .371 with 

20 stolen bases and had reached 
base in every game when he injured 
his hand on April 21 against Indiana, 
which caused him to miss almost 
an entire month. If this award had 
been given then, the sophomore 
second baseman probably would 
have won it. Instead, it goes to the 

other half of the Wolverines’ infield 
tandem. 
Brdar 
was 
Michigan’s 

most consistent hitter all season, 
ranking second on the team with 
a .310 average primarily out of the 
three-hole. The senior shortstop 
also contributed with three home 
runs, 37 runs batted-in, 19 stolen 
bases on 24 attempts, and walked 
just as often as he struck out (23 
times), while improving upon his 
2016 statistical output in every 
single offensive category. But Brdar’s 
defense shined the most — at the 
most demanding position on the 
diamond, he made just three errors 
and recorded a pristine .988 fielding 
percentage, while displaying a knack 
for highlight-reel plays with his 
quickness, instincts and powerful 
arm.

An All-Big Ten First Team 

selection, Brdar also made a lasting 
impact as a leader during his time 
as a Wolverine. After the season-
ending loss to North Carolina, 
Bakich stated that Brdar will be “a 
hell of a coach” once his playing days 
are over.

Breakout Player: Johnny Slater
Everything written above about 

Brdar could just as easily be written 
about Slater. The senior centerfielder 
came to Michigan as a top prospect 
— a “five-tool” player who could run, 
throw, field, hit for average and hit 
for power. However, his first three 
seasons were inconsistent — he was 
a career .207 hitter with just four 
home runs and 32 RBIs entering his 

senior year.

But in 2017, Slater finally put his 

vast potential on display. He hit .299 
with five home runs, ranked second 
on the team in RBIs (47) and slugging 
percentage (.493) and stole 15 bases 
without being caught once. And 
as the veteran leader of a youthful 
outfield possessing two sophomores 
at the corners, Slater committed only 
one error as well.

“The guy works extremely hard,” 

Bakich said after Slater went 4-for-4 
with four doubles against Michigan 
State on April 18. “Part of this is 
just a byproduct of someone with 
tremendous work ethic… He’s going 
to continue to get better as he gets 
older, and it’s going to be exciting to 
watch.”

Newcomer of the Year: Miles 

Lewis

When Lewis’s original program, 

North Dakota, dropped baseball 
after last season, he became eligible 
to transfer anywhere and play 
immediately. And with Matt Ramsay 
and Cody Bruder graduating, the 
Wolverines desperately needed to 
reinforce their outfield. Lewis, a 
Freshman All-American who hit 
.360 last season, was a perfect fit.

The 
switch-hitting 
redshirt 

sophomore 
gave 
Michigan 

everything it anticipated. He made 
his mark as a Wolverine right away 
with a walk-off base hit against 
Seton Hall in the second game of 
the season, and finished with a .296 
average, .381 on-base percentage, 

19 stolen bases in 23 attempts and 
a team-leading 14 doubles. Lewis 
should remain a reliable middle-of-
the-order bat and presence in the 
field for Michigan in 2018, and as 
he continues to tap into his athletic 
potential — Bakich has described 
him as having a “football body” — he 
should only improve in his second 
season against Big Ten competition.

Best individual performance: 

Oliver Jaskie’s shutout of Ohio 
State on May 5

The Wolverines lost all five of their 

games against Ohio State last season, 
including a season-ending loss in the 
Big Ten Tournament. Bakich called 
this year’s meeting “personal”, saying 
it was marked on his team’s calendar. 
A complete-game shutout with 14 
strikeouts while allowing just seven 
hits and only one walk is spectacular 
in any context, but considering 
how meaningful this game was to 
Michigan, Jaskie’s performance was 
perhaps legendary.

The junior left-hander retired 

the first 10 Buckeyes that stepped to 
the plate and recorded a strikeout in 
every inning. And when Ohio State 
loaded the bases with two outs in the 
ninth, Jaskie induced a groundout 
to third to finish the first complete-
game shutout by a Wolverine hurler 
since 2012.

“I knew he would probably tackle 

me if I tried to take him out,” Bakich 
said. “That was his game and his 
game to finish.”

High point: 2-1 victory against 

Michigan State in regular season 
finale

Michigan came into the season 

priding itself on a “fighter mentality” 
defined 
by 
resiliency, 
mental 

toughness and performance in late-
inning situations. As a result, Bakich 
described the extra-inning victory 
over the Wolverines’ in-state rivals 
as a “microcosm” of the entire year. 
Michigan had been shut out through 
eight innings, but tied the score in the 
top of the ninth — only to load the 
bases with nobody out in the bottom 
half of the frame. But redshirt junior 
right-hander Jackson Lamb induced 
two groundouts and a pop-out to 
escape a near-certain loss, and Brdar 
singled home the winning run the 
next inning.

One week later, the Wolverines 

found out they were the last team 
in the NCAA Tournament. With 
that in mind, it’s possible this game 
could have been a deciding factor in 
Michigan’s postseason fate, making it 
even more significant.

Low point: Big Ten Tournament
The 
Wolverines 
entered 
the 

tournament with a real chance of 
claiming their second conference 
title in three seasons. Instead, upset 
losses to Northwestern and Indiana 
abruptly ended these hopes. Leading 
the Wildcats, 4-3, in the ninth inning, 
Lamb — who had not allowed a 
run all season — gave up three, and 
Michigan found itself in the loser’s 
bracket. The Wolverines

Michigan baseball coach Erik Bakich guided his team to a 42-17 record in his fifth season, the Wolverines’ winningest record since 2008.

See BASEBALL, Page 12


Walks doom Michigan in elimination loss

blew another late-inning lead 

against the Hoosiers, as senior right-
hander Mac Lozer — who also had a 
perfect ERA — gave up two runs in 
the eighth. Michigan kept the game 
alive by plating a run in the ninth, 
but eventually fell, 5-4, on Indiana’s 
walk-off hit in the 13th.

Not only did Michigan lose two 

games in heartbreaking fashion, but 
its culture of resiliency seemingly 
collapsed in Bloomington. Dominant 
all season, the Wolverines’ bullpen 
imploded, 
and 
Michigan 
never 

seemed to recover.

Up Next:
The Wolverines aren’t losing 

just any senior class. They will lose 
the first group recruited entirely by 
Bakich — a group he described as 
being “the best group of leaders by 
far” in his time at Michigan. This 
includes Brdar, Slater, Lozer and 
senior catcher Harrison Wenson 
— who despite a down offensive 
season was indispensable behind 
the plate. There’s a good chance 
they’ll lose more talent to the MLB 
Draft — junior third baseman Drew 
Lugbauer led the team with 12 home 

runs and possesses the necessary 
size, versatility and power to all 
fields to make him a prized slugging 
prospect, while Lamb and Jaskie 
could be drafted highly as well.

However, the Wolverines lost 

their top pitcher in Brett Adcock 
and top all-around hitter in Carmen 
Benedetti to the draft last year, 
and 
improved 
offensively 
and 

defensively this season. This is a 
testament to Bakich’s recruiting 
efforts — creating a program that can 
quickly fill holes and rebuild after 
the departure of key players. And 
there will be plenty of talent next 
year as it is — there’s a possibility 
Michigan’s top four starters in 
Jaskie, junior right-handers Alec 
Rennard and Ryan Nutof and junior 
left-hander Michael Hendrickson 
will all be back for their senior 
season. On the infield, Thomas and 
junior first baseman Jake Bivens will 
return, while Lewis, right-fielder 
Jonathan Engelmann, designated 
hitter/outfielder Nick Poirier and 
utility player Jimmy Kerr will look 
to take steps forward in their junior 
seasons.

Before the season, Bakich stated 

it would be hard for any freshman 
to consistently see playing time, 
but this was more a product of 

the experience of the team on the 
field and less anything to do with 
the class’s potential. Newcomers 
such as left-hander Tommy Henry 
and right-handers Karl Kauffman 
and 
Jack 
Weisenburger 
were 

productive when they got the 
chance — combining for a 2.88 ERA 
and 55 strikeouts in 50 innings — 
and should see more innings next 
season, while outfielders Christian 
Bullock and Dominic Clementi 
are likely to carve out roles as well. 
Wenson’s impact as catcher can’t be 
overstated, but rising sophomores 
Marcus Chavez and Harrison Salter 
have the potential to complement 
each other with their defensive and 
offensive skills, respectively.

Next season, Michigan yet again 

will bring in the No. 1 recruiting class 
in the Big Ten, and the No. 26 class 
in the country according to Perfect 
Game USA, highlighted by pitchers 
Cody Bolton and Blake Beers and 
outfielder Jesse Franklin. While 
it may be too early to speculate on 
how many of the Wolverines’ 14 
freshman next season will receive 
substantial playing time, it’s clear 
that Bakich’s goal is to establish a 
perennial power, and this year’s 
recruiting class is further indication 
that he is doing so.

It’s not often that a college baseball 

game is interrupted by a dog.

But with two outs in the fifth 

inning, Remington — a golden 
retriever that serves as North 
Carolina’s in-dugout therapy dog — 
ran out on the field.

That 
seemingly 
innocuous 

moment proved to be a turning 
point for the Tar Heels’ offense to 
break through, this breakthrough 
aided by Michigan pitcher Michael 
Hendrickson’s 
complete 
loss 
of 

control.

The junior left-hander hit two 

batters and surrendered two free 
passes, including a bases-loaded 
walk, in the fifth frame, allowing the 
Tar Heels to take a lead they wouldn’t 
relinquish off a two-RBI single from 
second baseman Ashton McGee.

“(Hendrickson) 
was 
smooth 

sailing, and if I knew (his loss of 
control) was going to happen, I 
would’ve 
warmed 
up 
someone 

sooner,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “But a couple hits, a couple 
walks, and the rally started.”

North Carolina (48-13 overall, 1-1 

postseason) defeated the Wolverines, 
8-1, 
eliminating 
the 
Michigan 

baseball team (42-17, 0-2) from the 
Chapel Hill Regional of the NCAA 
Tournament.

Despite surrendering just 8 hits, 

Wolverine pitchers’ wildness was the 
culprit behind the lopsided score.

After Hendrickson was pulled in 

the sixth frame, junior right-hander 
Ryan Nutof walked another two 
batters that would score via a Tar 
Heel double and sacrifice fly. And in 
the seventh inning, sophomore left-
hander William Tribucher gave away 
another two bases-on-balls and an 
RBI double, as North Carolina would 
extend its lead by two runs.

For the contest, Michigan hurlers 

combined to give away 12 free passes, 
walking nine and hitting three 
batters.

“That’s what North Carolina does 

so well,” Bakich said. “They hold the 
zone, draw a lot of walks — they have 
over 300 on the season. They’re a very 
dangerous club when you put them 
on base and give them free passes.”

Through four innings, however, 

Michigan was the better team.

Junior 
third 
baseman 
Drew 

Lugbauer launched a towering solo 
homer in the second frame — the 
team’s second of the regional — 
to open the scoring. Meanwhile, 
Hendrickson was effective in forcing 

soft contact, inducing two double 
plays to erase early Tar Heel threats.

But while the Wolverines’ pitching 

became wild, Tar Heel right-hander 
Luca Dalatri maintained his control 
deep into Saturday’s ball game, 
striking out six batters.

Michigan was held hitless after 

the fifth inning.

“(Dalatri) attacked the zone with 

the fast ball — he’s a good pitcher,” 
said senior shortstop Michael Brdar. 
“Sometimes, the hits don’t fall, but 
you have to tip your cap to a guy who 
gave up only one run.”

For a Wolverine squad that showed 

promise this season, and reached as 
high as 13th in the national rankings, 
Michigan’s finish to the season was 
especially disappointing to Bakich, as 
his team lost its final four games of the 
year, and also because the loss marks 
the end of the careers of the fifth-year 
coach’s first recruiting class.

“This one stings the most out of 

the five years our staff has been 
here because of the kids we have 
on this team,” Bakich said. “Kids 
like Michael Brdar and the seniors 
have made this ride so much fun. 
They’ve been so consistent all 
along up until the end.

“You never want it to end when 

you’re having so much fun.”
