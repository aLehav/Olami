K culture of ETAs: Hair is every-

a "real" Elvis. Natural black is best,
though wigs, if styled right, work
too.
Your weight will determine
what type of Elvis you will be able
to impersonate. The general rule:
"The heavier you are, the later you

inthe end,yourvoices made all the
difference," Plouffe wrote.
In an interview, Business senior
Manish Parikh, president of the
University's Central Student Gov-
ernment, said the extension is a
victory for college students, add-
ing that they helped make the
extension possible by taking con-
trol of their own issue.
"The president kicked off this
whole tour of college affordabil-
ity at the University of Michigan
on January 27 and countless Uni-
versity of Michigan students have
taken to Facebook and Twitter
and written to their congressmen
and elected officials and media to
discuss this whole issue and the
previous situation of risingcollege
interest rates," Parikh said. "But
the students here are the real vic-
tors and the real ones who made
this happen."
Parikh said he was glad the
extension would help save many
University students nearly $1,000
this year. But he said measures to
make college more affordable are
as pressing as ever, noting that
many University students already
have debt.
"The average University of
Michigan student is accruing
$27,828 of average debt when
(they) graduate," Parikh said.
Parikh added that he would
like to see the issue resolved on a
longer-term basis so debate over
extending the rates doesn't need
to happen year after year.
"Stafford loan interest rates
should be permanently kept at the
low level of 3.4 percent, as opposed
to these low rate-shaving to be
renewed on a yearly basis, without
which they will double," Parikh
said. "The real discussion regard-
ing these interest rates we should
be having is about further reduc-
ing them, rather than discussing
the possibility of raising them."
In an e-mail to The Michigan
Daily, LSA junior Lauren Coff-
man, the communications director
for the University's chapter of the
College Democrats, wrote that she
was displeased that Republicans
made deliberation over the bill
take this long, but added that the
bipartisanship shown was a prom-
ising sign for students.-
"It's unfortunate that Congres-
sional Republicans allowed us to
get to the point that not passing
the bill was a concern, but it is
promising to see legislators from
both sides of the aisle coming
together to do what'sbest for stu-

dents," Coffman wrote.
Coffman added that she hopes
the bill is only the start of reforms
from the President, if re-elected,
as well as increased awareness
toward making college more
affordable.
"Hopefully this bill will lead to
increased awareness of student
debt, and reforms which will give
recent graduates more freedom to
pursue career opportunities that
could greatly improve the quality
of life for our nation's citizens,"
Coffman wrote. "The president is
acutely aware of the toll that stu-
dent debt can take, having recently
paid off his own student loans, and
I'm sure we'll see more of his dedi-
cation to increased access to edu-
cation throughout the campaign
season."
In an interview, LSA senior
Rachel Jankowski, chair of the
University's chapter of the College
Republicans, said it was good to
see higher education as a priority,
abut added that the legislation isn't
fixing the actual problem.
"Ithinkit'sgreatthatweworked
together - both Democrats and
Republicans - to pass the bill,
especially on something as impor-
tant as education," Jankowski
said. "But I think the reason why
a lot of Republicans may not have
been completely for it is because it
doesn't really do much to address
the cost of tuition."
Jankowski added that the cost
of education continues to rise and
said subsidizing interest rates isn't
going to fix the rise of higher edu-
cation.
"It's incredibly short-term, and
eventually those interest rates are
going to most likely go up again
because you can only sustain that
for so long and you still have the
underlying issue, so it really does
nothing to solve the actual prob-
lem."
In an e-mail to the Daily, Pame-
la Fowler, executive director of the
University's Office of Financial
Aid, wrote that University stu-
dents-will benefit from the legisla-
tion.
"We had estimated the average
student, who borrows each year
for an undergraduate degree and
repays that loan over the standard
10-year repayment period, would
have paid $1,000 more in interest
if the legislation had not gone for-
ward. Saving $1,000 over 10 years
will mean a lot to our students,"
Fowler wrote. "Let's hope we can
get long-term interest rate relief
for students - and soon."

curious. At ElvisFest, the main attraction,
for most of the attendees, was the
Introduction to the King music.
And wow, was the music some-
ElvisFest can best be described thing. Large and sweaty, Elvis

impersonator Robert Washington
crooned lovely somethings in a
tight, white tasseled jumpsuit to the
screaming ladies below him. Tall,
tanned Matt King, gold buttons
festooned on a black jumpsuit and
matching cape, pinwheeled across
the stage in a nonstop paroxysm of
adrenaline. My friend, herself an
avid Elvis fan, told me her favorite
artist of the night was University
alum Chris Ayotte, who not only
managed to flawlessly recreate clas-
sic Elvis moves but also put his own
spin on them (she tried to explain
one to me - something to do with a.
curtain?).
Agigglygroup of retirees in ceru-
lean Hawaiian shirts and plastic
flowers in their hair from Colum-
bus, Ohio, stayed up by the stage the
entire night, extending their hands
each time an Elvis threw down a
scarf or bent to give them a kiss.
They were so enthusiastic that the
emcee dubbed them "Girls Gone
Wild 1965."
The festival was occasionally
bracketed by accompanying acts
riding on the coattails of the Elvis

fanaticism permeating the park. A
lukewarm "Great Balls of Fire" was
sung by a Jerry Lee Lewis imper-
sonator, which nobody paid much
attention to. There's a reason why
there aren't many Jerry Lee Lewis
tribute festivals in the world.
I was drawn to a pair of ladies
in matching sun hats, wearing
floor-length cloth skirts with Elvis
heads embossed on-the fabric (one
blue, one red): Phyllis Sanders and
her granddaughter Maria. Though
Phyllis had been a proud attendee
of almost every ElvisFest since its
inception, it was Maria's first time.
She said her favorite Elvis songs
were "I Can't Stop LovingYou" and
"Jailhouse Rock," but she couldn't
really choose. "I just love them all,"
she said.
I spoke to them right after King
finished up, ending his set by toss-
ing out dark scarves to the audience
beneath him. "I was sad you didn't
get one," Maria said to her grand-
mother. "That's OK, I've gotten
them before," she replied cheer-
fully.
Sanders couldn't sit still for the

entirety of the festival, pump-
ing her fist to the rat-tat-tat of the
beat, grooving to each guitar lick.
She said she saw Elvis live three
times when she was a little girl but
was so far away from the stage she
needed binoculars. The Michigan
ElvisFest was deemed to be "much
more awesome."
Hair is everything
On Tuesday, August 16, 1977,
Elvis Aaron Presley was found on
the bathroom floor of his home,
clad in nothing but a pair of blue
pajamas. An hour later, he was pro-
nounced dead.
Months after Presley's death,
mournful fans crammed into Las
Vegas floor shows and tiny night-
clubs to watch Elvis impersonators
recreate the magic of the King. For
the Elvis Tribute Artists (or ETAs),
these shows proved to be enor-
mously profitable. Alan Meyer, who
worked in a Las Vegas lounge act,
claimed to have earned more than
a million dollars in one year.

Justice for juveniles
Juveniles no longer serve a life sentence without parole
The Supreme Court recently ruled that a life sentence without
parole for juveniles is unconstitutional, forcing states to alter
their current laws. Michigan is currently one of the strictest
states in the nation, with a law that forces judges to give children as
young as 14 the maximum adult penalty for first-degree murder, with
no chance of parole. On Tuesday, the Michigan House Corrections
Appropriations Subcommittee will conduct a hearing on this ruling.
The Michigan legislature must revise the juvenile life sentence law to
match the Supreme Court's ruling.

Up at 6, bags out at 7, on the bus

nous. Not that

plain. Having

Italy with me CAT N
was an amaz- MORATH
ing opportu-
nity, one I was
fortunate to have. But let's just say
spending 12-hour days with a tour
group whose median age probably
centered around SO is a wee bit dif-
ferent than backpacking around
Europe with a group of college kids.
I spent the past five weeks
immersed in Italian culture, always
attempting to avoid the faux pas
that would instantly give away my
American citizenship. I avoided
dipping my bread in oil, kept my
voice down in public places, gave up
on tipping and became an expert at
deciphering the meaning of Italian
words using the little experience I
had.
All of that hard work was erased
within 10 minutes of the official
start of our tour.
For the first activity, our group of
28 travelers took over a restaurant
at dinnertime. Sitting down at a
table set with water, bread and but-
ter should have been my first hint
that the next 10 days were going
to be nothing like my previous few
weeks. It foreshadowed- the treat-
ment we would receive at every res-
taurant and hotel and on.every tour
fromthatpointforward. The people
conducting these tours know their
job is to keep foreign tourists happy,
because a happytourist means big-
ger tips. Thus, a great effort was
made to maintain an environment
that mimicked what one might
find in the U.S. From continen-
tal breakfasts to the "night time"
excursions that ended before most
locals left their homes to go out for
the night, the trip was designed to
make American travelers feel com-
fortable, practically right at home.
This seems like a strange goal foran
international tour company to have.
Bus tours do have their advan-
tages. They offer a worry-free envi-
ronment in which your day and
activities come pre-planned. Each
day is jam-packed with historical
monuments, important museums
and a decent share of tourist traps.
After less than two weeks on tour,
I can check off a large number of
"must-see" sights on my bucket
list. But for me, travel isn't about a
checklist.

One of my favorite parts of trav-
eling is the opportunity to immerse
myself in a new culture. A bus tour
didn't allow me the time or free-
dom to accomplish thatgoal. Rather
than devoting at least a few days to
a city like I did during my indepen-
dent travel, the tour had us rolling
through at least three cities almost
every day. There was no time to
get your bearings, no time to min-
gle with the locals and no time to
just sit and people-watch for asfew
hours. In fact, the tour took such
care to keep Americafi vacationers
within their comfort zone that it
totally removed me from mine.
Bus tours are
efficient, but
inauthentic.
My suspicion that the restau-
rants, hotels and tour guides with
whomwe interactedwere tweaking
their service to cater to what they
perceivedias our "American needs"
was confirmed by our tour guide
on one of the last days of the trip.
In trying in explain to a very con-
flused couple why the service they
received on an independent din-
ner was so divergent from what we
experience at our group dinners, he
conceded that much of the service
we received was adjusted from the
Italian standard in order to make it
more palatable to tourists.The news
seemed to come as a shock to some
of my fellow travelers who seemed
unaware that English and ice water
don't come standard in Italy.
This newfound informationactu-
ally had an impact on the last leg of
ourtrip. Afterbeinginformed about
some Italian customs, many travel-
ers made a valiant effort to readjust
their actions in order to better fit
in to the local scene. It seems as if
the tour company vastly underesti-
mated the lengths their clientele is
willing to go in order to fit into the
culture they paid so much money to
visit.
Touring a foreign country by bus
may be efficient, but it takes some-
thing away from the authentic-
ity and adventure of international
travel. I'm going to make sure the
next group tour I travel with offers
a genuine experience, not a cookie-
cutter version of a culturethatsome
tour company thinks Americans
expect.

Michigan hockey
head coach to suit up
for Red Wings
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
DETROIT - The Winter Classic
festivities have grown exponen-
tially since the Detroit Red Wings
were named the host of the 2013
edition of the hockey game, and
Red Wings general manager Ken
Holland looks to keep expanding.
The Hockeytown Winter Fes-
tival - which currently includes
the Great Lakes Invitational and a
four-team Ontario Hockey League
tournament - will have not one,
but two alumni games at Comerica
Park in Detroit this year.
Holland announced on
Wednesday the inclusion of a sec-
ond alumni game due to the sheer
number of well-known alumni
from both the Red Wings and the
Toronto Maple Leafs.
"You're going to have the great-
est Red Wings and Leafs players in
the history of both historic fran-
chises, many of them on the same
rink for one day," Holland said at
Wednesday's press conference at
Comerica Park. "I think it's going
to be incredible.
"We just started putting names
down, and when you want to put
22 to 23 Red Wings' names down,
you leave a lot off. We're not sure
exactly how the breakdown is
going to go, but we're going to
have two games."
As of Tuesday, Red Wings
Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay, Alex
Delvecchio, Mickey Redmond,
John Ogrodnick, Luc Robitaille,
Dino Ciccarelli, Chris Chelios,
Larry Murphy, Mark Howe, Kris
Draper, Kirk Maltby, Darren
McCarty, Joe Kocur, and goalies
Chris Osgood and Mike Vernon
are confirmed to attend.
Maple Leafs alumni include
Darryl Sittler, Rick Vaive, Darcy
Tucker, Felix Potvin, Mike Pal-
mateer, Kevin Maguire, Dave
Andreychuk, Doug Gilmour, for-
mer Wings Wendel Clark and
Curtis Joseph, and Johnny Bower,

Ron Ellis and Jim McKenny.
Though only the preliminary
rosters were announced, Holland
expects both organizations to
reach out to contact more alumni.
Holland said he hopes to include
40 or 50 former Red Wings,
including current Michigan hock-
ey head coach Red Berenson, who
played in Detroit from 1970-75.
Alex Delvecchio, who played
with Berenson from 1970-74, jok-
ingly said he wasn't so sure if he'd
see Berenson on the ice. at the
alumni game.
"I'm certain he's going to be
invited," Delvecchio said. "He
was a great part of the Red Wings.
(But) does he still skate?"
"I would
anticipate and
expect Red to
be in uniform."
Though Berenson's name
wasn't included on the prelimi-
nary roster, Holland is confident
Berenson will participate in the
alumni game.
"(Berenson is a) great Red
Wing, and definitely should be
out there playing," Holland said.
"Certainly we'll contact Red.
What we're trying to do is contact
a few (at a time), and contact a few
more. Certainly Red is on our list,
and I would anticipate and expect
Red to be in uniform."
Now that the NHL Draft and
the July 1 free agency have passed,
Holland is able to focus more time
on reaching out to alumni to final-
ize the roster.
When will Holland contact
Red?
"Probably in the next month,
now that things have slowed
down," Holland said. "Guys want
to make plans, and we want to
make sure they get notified well
in advance to commit. Red's defi-
nitely on my list."

The Michigan House Cor-
rections Appropriations' Sub-
committee plans to review the
implications of the U.S. Supreme
Court decision banning manda-
tory life sentences for juveniles
tomorrow. In a 5-4 decision, the
U.S. Supreme Court decided that
mandatory life sentences without
the chance for parole was uncon-
stitutionally cruel. This ruling will
have a substantial impact on the
state of Michigan, which ranks
second in the nation in terms of
prisoners serving life for crimes
committed at age 17 and younger.
Michigan's current law doesn't'
seem to take the mental state of
a teenager into account. Teenag-
ers' brains aren't as developed
as adult brains, making teenag-
ers more impulsive. They lack
maturity and don't have a fully
developed sense of responsibil-
ity. According to Time Magazine,

it's not until we're in our mid to
late 20s that the prefrontal cor-
tex is fully laid out and engaged.
Juveniles clearly don't have the
mental capabilities of adults;
therefore, they shouldn't be
treated as such.
Each inmate also costs
$35,000 per year. Michigan has
the opportunity to save money
while also giving past prisoners
the chance to lead different and
productive lives. According to
data released in 2011, 346 Michi-
gan juveniles are currently serv-
ing a life sentence without parole.
Thus, Michigan will save at least
$1.2 million per year under the
Supreme Court ruling. Michigan
has the rare opportunity to save
money and help people start new
lives.
This ruling highlights the
many flaws of the U.S. prison
system. The U.S. has the highest

incarceration rate in the world
and many prisons are over-
crowded as a result. This envi-
ronment breeds violence and
hate, making it difficult for freed
prisoners to adjust to life outside
of prison.
Juveniles sentenced to life in
prison deserve a second chance
at life. Michigan's policy was
unjust and the Supreme Court
was correct in declaring life in
prison without parole for juve-
niles unconstitutional. Now it's
up to the state of Michigan to
alter the law in accordance with
this ruling not only to save mil-
lions of dollars, but also to give
these prisoners a fair chance at a
better life. This ruling is only the
beginning of the difficult prob-
lem of changing the U.S. prison
system, but it is a step in the right
direction toward comprehensive
prison reform.

Baseball adds to incoming 2012-13 class

Not so simple

ALICIA KOVALCHECK

Michigan's co-Mr..
Baseball will enroll
in the fall
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
New Michigan baseball head
coach Erik Bakich, known for
his excellent recruiting skills, is
already mak-
ing strides at the NOTEBOOK
helm of the Wol-
verines' program.
On Thursday, it was announced
that right-handed pitcher Alex
Daar will enroll at Michigan begin-
ning in the fall.
Daar joins nine other incoming
freshmen - including fellow pitch-
ers Jake Balicki and Tim Shannon
- to help a team that finished at the
bottom of the Big Ten standings.
Daar was the co-Mr. Baseball in
the state of Michigan in 2012, and
was selected to the All-State first
team and the MSHBCA Dream
Team. He attended University
Liggett, where he went 28-3 on
the mound in his last two seasons,
helping the Knights clinch a state
championship in 2011 and finish as
runners-up in 2012.
"We are thrilled to add Alex to
this year's recruiting class," Bakich
said in a statement released by the
Michigan athletic department on

Thursday. "He had a tremendous
amount of success on the field
this year and is very deserving of
the Mr. Baseball award. We look
forward to his contributions as a
pitcher in Maize and Blue."
Daar, Balicki and Shannon are
just three of the five pitchers that
will be added to Michigan's roster
in the fall. The Wolverines didn't
fare well on the mound in 2012,
sitting near the bottom of almost
every Big Ten pitching statistics
category.
FUTURE ACES: Sophomore
Trent Szkutnik is making a name
for himself in his summer appear-
ances.
Szkutnik pitched a no-hitter on
June 26, as he struck out 14 while
walking just two in his appearance
for the Dayton Docs. The Temper-
ance, Mich. native secured the
win as Dayton topped Grand Lake,
10-0.
As of July 11, Szkutnik is 3-2
with a 3.10 ERA while striking out
35 batters in 29 innings of work.
He was invited to the Great Lakes
League All-Star game as a part of
the 2012 Great Lakes Summer Col-
legiate League North All-Stars.
And two other pitchers look to
improve their game to help a Wol-
verines' staff that had one of the Big
Ten's worst ERAs.
Senior Ben Ballantine, pitching
for the Cotuit Kettleers in the Cape

Sophomore Trent Szkutnik was named to the Great Lakes League All-Star team for his summer work with the Dayton Docs.

Cod League, and sophomore Matt
Ogden, a hurler for Morehead City
in the Coastal Plain League, have
improved their game, as well.
In his June 19 appearance, Bal-
lantine went eight innings, giving
up just three runs.
Ogden fanned seven in his start
and has a 2.04 ERA.
SILVER SLUGGERS: Junior
Michael O'Neill and sophomore

Will Drake are picking up right
where they left off at the end of the
season.
O'Neill hit a grand slam in his
June 30 appearance with Fal-
mouth, accounting for four of the
eight runs in the Commodores' 8-2
win. As of July 1, the junior slugger
has four home runs and 11 RBIs in
the Cape Cod League.
Drake, after a fantastic fresh-

man campaign that was cut short
by injury, is hitting .286 with six
RBIs as a Member of the Dayton
Does.
In addition, senior Patrick Bion-
di was named Cape Cod Hitter of
the Week on July 8. Biondi boost-
ed his batting average with three
multi-hit games during the week.
He leads in the Cape Cod League
with his .404 batting average.

In June, state Sen. Bert Johnson
(D-Detroit) introduced a bill that
would raise Michigan's minimum
wage to $10 per
hour by 2015.
He claimed in
a press release
that a high-
er minimum
wage would
improve stan-
dards of living
and stimulate MATTHEW
job creation. ZABKA
At first glance,
this seems to
make sense. If
all workers who make the current
minimum wage of $7.40 per hour
instead made $10 per hour, their
standards of living would go up.
How coulddanybody be against
higher standards of living?
While Johnson goes on to imply
that Republicans' opposition to his
bill is hurting working families,
the economics of minimum wage
is - at least at first glance - coun-
terintuitive, and there are sound
economic reasons for opposing
higher minimum wage.
Every introductory econom-
ics textbook uses a basic example
- typically an employer who is
unwilling to hire an employee
for a certain wage - which dem-
onstrates that minimum wage
distorts market equilibriums.
In particular, minimum wage
increases unemployment.
Even worse, those hit hard-
est by minimum wage are almost
always the poor. Since Java pro-
grammers, rocket scientists and
professional football players have
more lucrative options, they aren't
willing to sweep floors for $6
per hour. When minimum wage
increases, it is the unskilled work-
ers who are left jobless.
Most economists follow this
standard theory, but to be fair, there
are a few scholars who believe that
increasing the minimum wage
does not increase unemployment.
While supporters of minimum
wage love to sing the praise of the
minority of economists who doubt
whether minimum wage increases
unemployment, these supporters'
actions often singa different tune.
Remember the Association for
Community Organizations for
Reform Now, the former collection
of community-based organizations
and frequent supporter of raising
the minimum wage? In the '90s,
ACORN filed a court brief seek-
ing to exempt itself from a new,
higher minimum wage that stated,
"The more that ACORN must pay

each individual outreach worker -
either because of minimum wage
or overtime requirements - the
fewer outreach workers it will be
able to hire." So ACORN support-
ed minimum wage - as long as it
didn't have to paytheir workers the
minimum wage.
The minimum
wage increases
unemployment.
More recently, the last national
minimum wage increase applied
to all U.S. states and territories -
except for a special exception for
the tiny island territory of Ameri-
can Samoa, 40 percent of whose
workforce worked in the tuna
canning industry. Some specu-
late that since the tuna canneries'
firms were based in then-Speaker
of the House Nancy Pelosi's (D-
Calif.) district, she inserted the
special provision to avoid what
she knew would lead to a less com-
petitive tuna industry. When the
press pointed out this exception,
an embarrassed Pelosi asked Con-
gress to include Samoa in the mini-
mum wage increase.
Whether the former speaker
was responsible for the attempted
kickback may never be known, but
the effect that a higher minimum
wage is having on the no longer
exempt American Samoa is cer-

Big Ten, Pac-12 call off agreement

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor

The Big Ten and Pac-12 sched-
uling agreement that was planned
to begin in 2017 was called off on
Friday.
Scheduling issues involving a
few Pac-12 teams hindered the
collaboration, which included
a 12-game round-robin football
schedule, matchups involving
other sports and an agreement
betweenthe two conferences' tele-
vision networks.
"We are disappointed to
announce today that the Big Ten
Pac-12 strategic collaboration
announced jointly in December
2011 unfortunately will not be
consummated," said'Big Ten com-
missioner Jim Delany in a press .
release on Friday. "We recently
learned from Pac-12 commissioner

Larry Scott that the complications
associated with coordinating a
non-conference football schedule
for 24 teams across two confer-
ences proved to be too difficult.
Those complications, among other
things, included the Pac-12's nine-
game conference schedule and
previous non-conference commit-
ments."
He added: First seen on
"A - great
effort. was -the game
made by both
conference staffs to create football
schedules that would address the
variety of complexities, but in the
end, we were just not able to do so.
While everyone at the Big Ten is
disappointed by the news, we look
forward to continuing the historic
partnership that we have with the
Pac-12 and to working together on
other matters in the future."

Michigan released its 2014-16
non-conference schedules on June
27, where the Wolverines would
play a home-and-home series
against Utah in addition to games
against Colorado and Oregon
State.
But the Wolverines will keep its
2014-16 non-conference schedules,
keeping the Utes, Buffalo and Bea-
vers on their schedule in future
years.
Since this deal is suspended,
the.Big Ten will look to expand its
conference schedule from eight to
nine games or will reach out to col-
laborate with other conferences.
Nine Big Ten games would
eliminate any discrepancies in
naming a conference champion,
but a deal with another conference
could potentially boost a resume
for the future playoff selection
committee.

From my first football game to my last appearance
at the Big House, where I processed across the field in
my cap and gown along with thousands of my peers,
I've felt a mounting feeling of University of Michi-
gan pride. I've recognized the blue blood coursing
through my veins with each day spent sitting in class
in East Hall or Mason Hall, walking across the Diag
and eating lunch at the Union, transforming me into a
pure-bred Wolverine. I've never felt so much a part of
something greater than myself than when I sat in the
stands on April 22, 2012 listening to Dr. Sanjay Gupta
give the commencement address.
Fast forward about two and a half months as I walk
across campus on my way to the bank from my Ker-
rytown apartment. The buildings that once appeared
mountainous and awe-inspiring now seem a bit aver-
age, even flawed. In the quiet heat of summer, the city
ofAnn Arbor seems to engulf and overpower the cam-
pus, where the campus always seemed to stand pow-
erfully above the rest of the city. I feel like an adult
returning to her favorite childhood amusement park.
In many ways, I remembered it to be bigger and more
exciting "back then." I see students in "High School.

Class of 2010" t-shirts, relishing their summer campus
experience, and I suddenly feel so much older than I
did on April 22. I wonder when the maize and blue
chapter of my life ended and this new one began.
Since graduating, I've felt very conflicted about
leaving Michigan in the fall to go to graduate school
in Massachusetts. I've been very hesitant to leave this
place and the life that I love here in Ann Arbor. Yet,
walking past the Diag once more, on my way back to
my apartment, I realize that I'm finally a victor. I've
conquered this great mountain in my life: a University
of Michigan education. Where these buildings and
this campus once seemed so huge and daunting - as I
stood at the foot of my undergraduate career, looking
up -they now seem small andunimpressive asI stand
at the summit of the mountain looking down at all that
I've accomplished. Now that I've been able to remove
my maize-colored glasses, I can pass them on to the
next generation of Wolverines so they can also fall in
love with the beauty and wonder of the University of
Michigan. Finally, it's time to move forward.

Art Fairgoers to get
transportation help
from city
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
Yesterday, the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority
announced they will be providing
fee-based shuttle services for visi-
tors coming to town for the Ann
Arbor Art Fairs.
From July 18 to July 20 the
AATA will run two different
shuttle routes every 10 to 15 min-
utes, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. On
July 21 the routes will stop at 7
p.m. Both will pick up and return
passengers at Briarwood Mall
and Pioneer High School, which
will offer free parking.
One route will take passengers
from the parking lots to-the inter-
section of Main Street and Wil-

liam Street, near the Summer Art
Fair. The other route will drop
fairgoers off at South University
Avenue and
State Street, First seen on
between the - the wire
South Uni-
versity Area and State Street Art
fairs and near the Original Street
Art Fair.
The shuttles will cost $1.50 each
way for adults and $0.75 each way
for K-12 students and AATA Fare
Deal cardholders. Though the
MRide program allows MCard
holders to ride free on AATA's reg-
ular service, they are not valid for
the "ArtFairRide" shuttles.
The shuttle buses are wheel-
chair-accessible and some have
room for strollers as well. While
the buses will have some space for
"reasonably sized" artwork, the
AATA said riders with oversized
pieces should make other arrange-
ments.

Arbor since the 1980s.
"We've added 3 million square
feet. We've added 4,000 resi-
dents," Pollay said. "We've added
so much downtown since the last
garage - so it was time."
Pollay stressed that the garage
was built with not just cars in
mind, but people as well.
She said the garage's exposure
to natural light and its use of
materials such as stainless
steel and glass make it a more
comfortable environment for
drivers and added that the
garage's structure was built
to accommodate eventual
aboveground development.
"It's built for an apartment
building, it's built for a mixed
building, it's built for alot (of pos-
sibilities)," Pollay said.

PARTICLE
From Page1A
"The search for Higgs boson has
been one of the main research top-
ics in particle physics for the last
30 years," Qian said. "People have
been looking for it at a number of
colliders (around the world)."
Qian added that the Standard
Model assumes the universe has
a Higgs field, which spreads out
in space like an electric field, and
gives particles mass as they move
through it.
"Higgs particles are produced
as a result of the energy produced
by proton collisions ... then (the
particle) decays immediately,"
Qian said. "We looked at the par-
ticle created and reconstruct back
to see what are possible parent
particles and (then) conducted a
statistical analysis."
According to Qian, the under-
graduate and graduate students

who were involved in the discov-
eryhaveputinlonghourseachday
for the last few months research-
ing the Higgs boson particle.
"The students were more excit-
ed than anyone else," Qian said.
"They processed and analyzed the
data and it's rare for students to be
part of a major discovery."
According to a- press release,
CERN Director General Rolf
Heuer said the discovery is a mile-
stone in understanding the nature'
of being.
"The discovery of a particle
consistent with the Higgs boson
opens the way to more detailed
studies, requiring larger statis-
tics, which will pin down the new
particle's properties, and is likely
to shed light on other mysteries of
our universe," Heuer said in the
release.
