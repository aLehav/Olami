outlines new budget

Multiple food,
retail and office
tenants to take
E. Liberty building
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily News Editor
Upon completion of a major
remodel, the former, original
Borders store on East Liberty
Street will once again have ten-
ants.
Brendan Cavender, a real-
estate broker at Colliers Inter-
national, said the space is being
renovated to fit retail shops and
restaurants on the ground floor
and offices on the second floor.
The construction, which start-
ed in late November, is expected
to be completed this summer
and will include between five
and seven new storefronts on the
East Liberty side of the building,
Cavender said.
"Right now what's happen-

ing is the landlord is demo-ing
out the whole building," Caven-
der said. "They have plans to do
major upgrades on the outside
and completely update and redo
the interior."
The space is owned by
Hughes Properties, who bought
the building in June 2012. Ron
Hughes, the company's execu-
tive, said they have had many
businesses express interest inthe
property, and he hopes to have
tenants move in by the middle of
2013.-
"We've had tremendous
response for leasing the build-
ing," Hughes said. "We have in
various stages, about 80 percent
of the building pre-leased."
Cavender said Colliers is in
"final negotiations" with mul-
tiple businesses, but couldn't dis-
close the names of the potential
tenants. He added that they hope
to have a mix of local and nation-
al businesses in the space.

CITY GOVERNMENT
City welcomes
new members
to A2 council

G--GETTIN' TRASHED 

Members focused
on services, transit
and budget
By FARONE RASHEED
Daily StaffReporter
Three new City Council mem-
bers will take their seats in the
new session of city council after
being elected in November.
City councilmember Sumi
Kailasapathy (D-Ward 1), a
native of Sri Lanka, came to Ann
Arbor after fleeing an impend-
ing revolution in the south Asian
country.
After her education at Welles-
ley College and the New School
in New York City, a teaching
opportunity at Eastern Michigan
University brought Kailasapa-
thy to Ann Arbor, where she has
lived for 13 years. Since then, she
has practiced as a certified public
accountant. Kailasapathy claims
this experience has motivated
her to pursue local politics and
has inspired her to focus on plans
for the new fiscal cycle.
"We can do better with our
budgets and how we prioritize
and choose to spend," Kailasapa-

thy said. "I look at their budgets
and finances and I feel like I can
add something to this (job)."
Kailasapathy said she was
unsurprised byvoters' choices on
the city's recent ballot initiatives.
"It was a clear backlash -
people are having a construc-
tion fatigue," Kailasapathy said,
referring to the voters' rejection
of Proposal 1, the Ann Arbor Dis-
trict Library Downtown bond
proposal.
Kailasapathy's top priorities
include building up core services,
reigning in unfunded pension
and health care liabilities, and
protecting parks and environ-
mental resources. She also hopes
to bring more transparency and
accountability to the council.
"We are their servants and I
owe it to them," Kailasapathy
said. "My duty is to my people -
the people who elected me."
Councilmember Sally Hart
Petersen (D-Ward 2) came to
Ann Arbor from North Attlebor-
ough, Mass. in 1996. She received
an MBA from the Harvard Busi-
ness School.
Since relocating to Ann Arbor,
Petersen has had a prolific career
in both the public and private

Camp supports
kids with families
affected by cancer
ByASHWINI NATARAJAN
Daily StaffReporter
Being the child of a parent
with cancer can be emotion-
ally and physically stressful. To
combat this, the University's
chapter of Camp Kesem has con-
sistently provided a bit of magic,
or "kesem" in Hebrew, to serve
as a period of respite for children
coping with family illness.
Camp Kesem is a student-run
organization that coordinates
and fundraises for a free week-
long summer camp for children
whose parents currently have or
have had cancer. The organiza-
tion also strives to empower col-
lege students by teaching them
leadership skills through orga-
nizing fundraising projects and
volunteering as camp counselors.
The project started at Stanford
University in 2000 and has since
grown to 41 chapters. The Uni-
versity's chapter started in 2011
and now has about 40 members.

U.S. transports French troops Looking back 40 years later:

to Mali in ongoing conflict

The passage of Roe v. Wade

French continue
military operations
in Africa with
help of U.S.
SEGOU, Mali (AP) - Ameri-
can planes transported French
troops and equipment to Mali,
a U.S. military spokesman said
Tuesday, as Malian and French
forces pushed into the Islamist-
held north.
The town of Douentya had
been held by Islamist rebels for
four months, located 195 kilo-
meters (120 miles) northeast
of Mopti, the previous line-
of-control held by the Malian
military in Mali's narrow cen-
tral belt. The Islamist fighters
have controlled the vast desert
stretches of northern Mali,
with the weak government
clinging to the south, since a
military coup in the capital

in March last year unleashed
chaos.
French and Malian troops
arrived in Douentza on Monday
to find that the Islamists had
retreated from it, said a resi-
dent, Sali Maiga. "The Malian
military and the French army
spent their first night and the
people are very happy," Maiga
said Tuesday.
A curfew went into effect at
8 p.m., and no gunfire or other
incidents were reported over-
night, he said.
In September, a convoy of
pickup trucks carrying beard-
ed men entered Douentza, and
in the months that followed
the Islamist extremists forced
women to wear veils and
enlisted children as young as
12 as soldiers in training.
French and Malian forces
also took the town of Diabaly,
which lies 195 kilometers (120
miles) west of Mopti, on Mon-
day after Islamist fighters who

0 0

had seized it a week earlier fled
amid French air strikes.
The presence of Malian sol-
diers in the two towns marks
tangible accomplishments for
the French-led mission, which
began on Jan. 11 after the reb-
els pushed south and threat-
ened the capital, Bamako. But
there are grave doubts that
the Malian army will be able
to hold newly recovered terri-
tory without foreign support.
The coup disrupted the chain
of command, and Malian sol-
diers last year repeatedly gave
up towns to the insurgents
while putting up little, or no,
fight.
While fighting raged on the
ground in Mali, officials in
Brussels discussed plans for
the future. The newly appoint-
ed head of the planned Euro-
pean Union military training
mission, French Gen. Francois
Lecointre, is already in Bama-
ko assessing the situation.

40 years after U.S.
Supreme Court
ruling, abortion
still hot topic
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Abor-
tion opponents marked the 40th
anniversary of the Roe v. Wade
decision Tuesday with work-
shops, prayers and calls for
more limits on the rights estab-
lished by the Supreme Court in
the landmark ruling that still
defines one of the nation's most
intractable debates.
Many in the anti-abortion
movement looked to Kansas,
where Republican Gov. Sam
Brownback signed a series of
tough anti-abortion measures
during his first two years in
office. Other states with GOP
governors and Republican-con-
trolled legislatures have taken
similar steps.
"There's joy in what you're
doing and keep it up," Brown-
back urged hundreds of fellow
abortion opponents at a rally
outside the Kansas Statehouse.
"Keep marching. Keep moving."
Abortion-rights groups
observed a quieter anniver-
sary - a possible reflection of
the reality that it's far rarer for
lawmakers to expand access to
abortion. The National Orga-
nization for Women planned a
candlelight vigil at the Supreme
Court to commemorate the 1973
decision, which created a con-
stitutional right to abortions in
some circumstances and pre-
vented states from banning the
practice.
President Barack Obama
issued a statement reaffirm-
ing the decision's commitment
to "reproductive freedom" and
the principle that "government
should not intrude on our most
private family matters, and
women should be able to make
their own choices about their
bodies and their health care."
The ruling "should be hon-

ored," said Rep. Emily Perry, a
lawyer and Democrat from the
Kansas City suburb of Mission
who supports abortion rights.
"I wish the amount of energy
put into narrowing Roe v. Wade
would be put into school fund-
ing or our budget."
In Topeka, at least 1,000
people rallied with Brownback
and anti-abortion legislators.
The Kansas governor has called
on state lawmakers to create "a
culture of life." He is expected
to support whatever further
restrictions they approve.
Kansans for Life, the most
influential of the state's anti-
abortion groups, plans to ask
lawmakers to enact legislation
ensuring that the state doesn't
finance abortions even indirect-
ly, such as through tax breaks or
by allowing doctors-in-training
at the University of Kansas
Medical Center in Kansas City,
Kan., to perform them on the
center's time.
The group also wants to
strengthen a state law dictat-
ing what information must be
provided to abortion patients,
banning abortions because of
the fetus' gender and allowing
wrongful-death lawsuits when
a fetus dies because of an acci-
dent.
Comparable proposals are
gaining ground elsewhere, too.
Republican lawmakers in North
Dakota are pursuing a measure
to ban "sex selection" abor-
tions. Alabama's GOP legislative
majorities are looking to impose,
new health and safety regula-
tions for abortion providers.
And Republicans in Arkansas
want to ban abortions after the
20th week of pregnancy.
"I think more of America is
becoming more pro-life," said
Dr. Melissa Colbern, who start-
ed a crisis pregnancy center in
Topeka near the state Capitol
last year. "I think maybe the cul-
ture is changing." -
In Mississippi, where Repub-
lican Gov. Phil Bryant has said
repeatedly that he wants the

state to be abortion-free, advo-
cates on both sides of the issue
protested outside the state's only
abortion clinic in the capital of
Jackson. A large sign attached
to the building declared: "This
clinic stays open."
Nancy Keenan, president
of NARAL Pro Choice Amer-
ica, said most citizens are not
demanding their elected offi-
cials push for new abortion
restrictions.
"A lot of these anti-choice
politicians don't run on the
issue," Keenan said in an inter-
view Tuesday with The Associ-
ated Press. "They run on jobs, or
they run on the economy. And
then they show up in these state
legislatures, and they begin to
advance very anti-choice legis-
lation."
In the four decades since Roe
v. Wade, a series of court deci-
sions have narrowed its scope,
With each decision, lawmakers
in multiple states have followed
up by making abortions more
difficult to obtain or imposing
restrictions on providers.
According to the New York-
based Guttmacher Institute, a
reproductive-rights think tank,
135 laws aimed in some way at
restricting access to abortion
were enacted in 30 states -
most of them with Republican-
controlled legislatures - in 2011
and 2012. More such measures
already have been proposed in
several states this year.
In Wyoming, for example,
a pending bill would prohibit
abortions after a fetal heartbeat
is audible. A similar "heartbeat"
bill is pending in Mississippi,
and one was debated but later
sidetracked in Ohio last year.
In Texas, Republican Gov.
Rick Perry has told lawmakers
that he expects to make progress
during the 2013 session toward
his goal of making abortion "at
any stage a thing of the past."
Anti-abortion activists have
pledged to use every legal means
possible to make obtaining abor-
tions difficult, if not impossible.

In a stunning setback, Prime

possibly forcing the incumbent
Israeli leader to invite surpris-
ingly strong moderate rivals into
his government and soften his
line toward the Palestinians.
TV exit polls showed the
hard-liners with about 61 seats
in the 120-seat parliament, a
bare majority, -and the counts
could change as actual votes are
tallied.
The unofficial + TV results
had Netanyahu winning only 31
seats, though he combined his
Likud Party with the far-right
Yisrael Beitenu for the voting.
Running separately four years
ago, the two won 42 seats. He
expected to increase that total by

running together, but the com-

said he hopes the new business-
es will help the other local shops
more than Borders helped in its
final years.
"Borders was great in its hey-
day, but of course over the last
few years - even before their
demise - they had steadily gone
downhill," Bellas said. "We're
just glad to have that space
filled."
Sean Havera, senior project
manager at Hughes Properties,
said the initial construction is
going well so far, and they hope
to start phase two of the demoli-
tion in the coming weeks.
"Everything is going smooth-
ly," he said.
Havera, who last worked on
the Landmark apartment build-
ing with Hughes Properties, said
they are keeping the original
fagade but added windows, mul-
tiple entryways and updated fix-
tures in order to change the look
of the building.
Susan Pollay, executive direc-
tor of the Ann Arbor Downtown
Development Authority, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she
thinks the breaking up of the

building into smaller business
spaces is a wise decision in the
present economic climate.
"The continuing evolution of
downtown appears to indicate
that the marketplace right now
can support smaller store-front
sizes than we had previously,"
Pollay wrote.
Bellas said the construction
workers downtown have been
supporting current businesses
already, and he hopes the trend
will continue once the new ten-
ants move in.
"Having workers here every
day is very important to the
neighborhood," Bellas said.
"Having people shop and eat
where they live and where they
work - to have that number of
people here on a daily basis, just
benefits everybody."
Pollay is glad such an impor-
tant downtown building will be
filled again.
"It is a terrific thing to see
the former Borders building
filled with tenants, as it has
been an anchor location for the
neighborhood for more than 40
years," Pollay wrote. "Down-
town is at its heart a commer-
cial district, and it's great to see
new businesses moving into the
building."


MICHIBLOGS
From Page 1A
LSA junior Heather Fend-
ell linked her blog, "Smile and
Sprinkles," to the site. The
blog was inspired by a summer
internship at A+E Networks -
which owns channels like Life-
time - but her posts are on a
wide range of subjects, including
baking and crafts.
"Lifetime did a lot of joint
project(s) and events with vari-
ous bloggers, which got me
started on looking into vari-
ous blogs," Fendell wrote in an
e-mail interview. "I liked the
concept and thought it would be
fun to have an interactive online
journal."
Fendell's blog includes a myr-
iad of recipes, book suggestions
and, most recently, accounts of
her study abroad experiences in
Italy.
Business junior Alex Gold-
farb started his blog "East U &
Down" this summer while on a
trip to Israel with the Univer-
sity's TAMID.Israel Investment
Group, a program that exposes
U.S. business students to Israel's
economy.
Goldfarb said he used his blog
not only as an outlet to describe
his experiences in Israel, but
also as a place to write about
his viewpoint on the intersec-
tion of business and morality, an
idea that occurred to him while
working at a non-profit organi-
zation that involved food system
injustice.
His blogging reflects global

awareness he said he has gained
during his Business School edu-
cation and work experiences.
His most recent post, for exam-
ple, deals with the growing nat-
ural commodity deficit and the
way in which China is guarding
itself against this adversity.
Another University blogger,
LSA junior Yasha Chernyak,
uses his blog as an artistic realm
displaying his own photographs
and those taken by others. He
said the blogging community on
Michiblogs inspired him to con-
tinue his posts.
"I would have quit ages ago,
but the Ann Arbor community
on Tumbr kept me around,"
Chernyak said.
While Chernyak has been
interested in photograph since
childhood, he has been blogging
for about a year and just recently
made an account on Michiblogs
this fall.
University alum Pat Stansik,
famous for Pre-Gaming with
Pat, a video blog that is popular
with the Greek community, is
also featured on Michiblogs. In
Pre-Gaming with Pat, Stansik is
seen interviewing not-so-sober
undergrads as they prepare for
games at the Big House. His
blog, "Pat Stansik Original Vid-
eos," includes several of his
other YouTube projects.
Michiblogs has received
25,000 hits to date, Green said.
He added that he hopes he can
expand the site in the future.
"(I'm) eager to welcome more
musicians, photographers, art-
ists, etc., in addition to bloggers
in the coming years."


SUMMER
From Page 1A
For the 2013 session of Camp
Kesem, there were more than
100 student applications for
counselor positions and more.
than 80 campers signed up less
than a month after applica-
tions were released. There are
expected to be between 50 and
60 student volunteer counselors.
Because of the increased number
of camper applications, the club
plans to add a second week to the
session.
LSA senior Michael Ho, fun-
draising coordinator for Camp
Kesem, said the strong support
system the camp creates for the
children is invaluable in helping
them cope with the stresses of
home life.
"Camp Kesem is important
because kids whose parents have
cancer are part of an under-

served population with few
resources available," Ho said.
"Camp Kesem provides a safe,
loving environment for kids to
share feelings and experiences
with others who know what they
have gone through."
Recent LSA . graduate Anna
Shatsman, co-chair of the pro-
gram, said the camp creates a
strong bonds between counsel-
ors and campers.
"I love how Camp Kesem is
not only creating a network, but
more importantly a family of
people you can always rely on
and stay in touch with for your
entire life," said Shatsman.
Along with giving back to the
community, college students cul-
tivate qualities of leadership that
are vital for creating a long-term
social impact according to LSA
senior Joanna Gross, co-chair of
Camp Kesem.
"Our counselors develop
impeccable communication

skills and learn how to market
our 'Kesem' brand in order to
fundraise and make community
contacts," she said. "It is so much
more than being acamp counsel-
or for the week."
The club holds fundrais-
ing events throughout the
year. Before winter break, they
launched a campaign in which
student volunteers sent letters
to friends and family members
asking for donations - raising
$10,000. The club's Creepy Cat-
erpillar Crawl 5K, held last fall,
was also a success, members
said.
Ho said he aspires for the mis-
sion of the organization to reach
every child with affected par-
ents.
Upcoming club events include
a benefit dinner on Feb. 12th at 7
p.m. in the East Hall Psych Atri-
um and a silent auction and lun-
cheon event "Make the Magic"
in mid-March.

Aclear option
'U' should invest in higher resolution cameras
Students are reminded on a daily basis of just how crucial it is to
stay alert and safe on campus. When living in residence halls, part
of the students' safety is dependent on the security systems put
in place by the University. There-are security cameras at the entrance
of every residence hall and security teams working diligently to patrol
the halls. However, these security cameras don't produce clear pictures.
Campus safety should be a priority for the University, especially after the
recent sexual assault in West Quad Residence Hall. The current cameras
need to be replaced with higher resolution ones that will make identifying

t was a brisk afternoon in
Washington D.C. as President
Barack Obama prepared to
be sworn into
office for a
second time on
the steps of the .
Capitol. The
pageantry was
certainly there
as hundreds of
thousands of
people stood by PAUL
to witness the SHERMAN
event and mil-
lions tuned in
on television. Even Beyonce made
an appearance to entertain White
House staffers. After waiting
months for this moment, Obama
placed his hand on two different
Bibles and proceeded to take the
oath of office. He's back in the
white House and ready take on the
new challenges that lie ahead.
With the second inauguration
behind us, it's time to reflect on
Obama's successes and failures. As
we turnthe page on his first term, we
can say that his administration did
make efforts to wind down the wars
in the Middle East. Now, it's time for
Obama to bring these wars to an end.
However, with a smaller number of
ground troops in Iraq and Afghani-
stan he must limit the use of aerial
drones in the coming years.
During his first term, Obama
dramatically increased the use of
unmanned aerial vehicles as a for-
eign policy tool in the Middle East
and Africa. Some in the media have
argued that Obama's position has
changed from supporting a nation-
building counterinsurgency strategy
in Iraq and Afghanistan to a whac-
a-mole approach that uses drones to
"take out" targeted enemies.
For policymakers in Washington,
it's time to reduce the military's
and intelligence agencies' depen-
dence on drones, since their contin-
ued usage is angering an increasing
number of civilians abroad. In
January 2012, Iraqi senior officials
expressed their outrage over the
use of a small number of drones in
Iraq after the withdrawal of Ameri-
can troops from the region. In

October 2012, thousands of Paki-
stanis, most notably in the capital,
Islamabad, protested against the
use of drones in the tribal regions
of the country. Going forward, the
president must keep this in mind
when he decides to use a drone
strike to take out targets.
Obama's reliance on drones has
created discord within the Unit-
ed States as well. Americans are
increasingly concerned about the
number of innocent civilians killed
by drone strikes. As a result, popu-
lar support for drones decreased
from 83 percent to 62 percent
between Feb. 2012 and June 2012
according to the Council on For-
eign Relations. Domestic support
remains high, but Americans are
starting to become more skeptical
about the ramifications of drone
strikes, particularly since theyhave
been left out of the discussion.
An increased use of drones can
create the possibility of prolifera-
tion. According to Micah Zenko,
an expert on U.S. national security
policy, there's possibility that "at
least a dozen other states and non-
state actors could possess armyted
drones within the next 10 years and
leverage the technology in unfore-
seen and harmful ways." This could
create a new arms war if the Ameri-
can government isn't careful. If
Obama continues to use drones at
a high rate, he will run the risk of
possible drone usage against mili-
tary personnel and possibly Ameri-
can civilians on U.S. soil.
On the other hand, drones have
achieved significant victories in the
battle against terrorism. Top Al-Qae-
da operatives, including U.S.-born
Muslim cleric Anwar al-Alwaki, have
been killed in drone strikes. Along
the Afghan border in Pakistan during
2012, drones killed 246 people, most
of whom were Islamic militants.
According to The New York Times,
since 2004, drones have killed 473
people, but there has been a decline
in that number in recent years. In
2012, drones killed only seven civil-
ians compared to 68 civilian deaths
in 2011.
Despite the increased accura-
cy of drones; there has been very

little oversight of the program.
Due to a lack of checks on drone
usage, Zenko explained that some
policymakers and White House
officials don't clearly understand
how the laws have changed or
how the attacks are conducted in
each country. In a 2012 interview
with Mark. Bowden, a journalist
who has reported extensively on
America's Middle Eastern affairs,
Obama stated that, "creating a
legal structure, processes, with
oversight checks on how we use
unmanned weapons" would be a
challenge "partly because technol-
ogy may evolve fairly rapidly for
other countries as well." A senior
official of the Central Intelligence
Agency stated that the CIA had
not conducted sufficient oversight
measures. Continuing to admin-
ister these drone attacks without
developing a concrete framework
could accelerate the Middle East's
problems and only stymie solutions
for those conflicts.
Responsible
policy is needed
to support local
populations.
In the end, because of their
increased accuracy and low cost
compared to the use of manned
aircraft and troops on the ground,
the Obama administration will
continue to use drones. Unmanned
aerial vehicles will prove an impor-
tant tool for U.S. foreign policy,
but Obama must consider scaling
down the use of drones and creat-
ing an effective oversight policy
during his second term. The presi-
dent must come up with a respon-
sible policy that will be effective in
taking out extremist threats while
limitingcivilian casualties and sup-
porting the needs of local civilian
populations.

potential suspects an easier process.
On Jan. 13, police reported a rape in West
Quad after a woman reportedly walked home
from a party escorted by a stranger. After fur-
ther investigation images of a suspect surfaced
from nearby security cameras that proved blur-
ry and made any means of identifying the sus-
pect difficult. The man was finally arrested six
days after the reported rape and released. The
investigation is ongoing.
The extensive amount of time it took the
perpetrator to be identified by UMPD is unac-
ceptable. The suspect was identified after the
University police received a tip, not from the
stills taken from the cameras. In the future, it's
importantthat the Universityre-evaluates how
this process can be quickened - which should
involve better technology.
However, students' privacy is extremely
important. High-resolution cameras should
replace the current cameras, which are located

at outdoor entrances to dormitories. Students'
privacy shouldn't be invaded, considering
other viable solutions to this problem exist.
The multiple cameras placed at each entrance
to University residence halls are sufficient,
but the quality of these cameras is not.
The University needs to take steps to
uphold the safety and welfare of all students.
This involves using the necessary resources
and funding to install higher resolution cam-
eras in all dorms. Though it may be expen-
sive, it's a crucial investment in the safety and
well-being of Michigan students.
With new, high resolution cameras
installed, suspects will be identified more
quickly and everyone on campus will be able
to rest a bit more easily knowing that Uni-
versity leaders took steps to make our com-
munity, specifically residence halls, as safe
as possible.

Last week, Time magazine published a
pieceon Roe v. Wade's 40th anniversary and
what the past 40 years have brought in the
way of reproductive justice. Though the arti-
cle made a few unfounded assumptions, it did
get one thing right: Ever since this landmark
decision was made to legalize abortion in the
United States, thousands of restrictions have
been made that belittle the hard-won prog-
ress made by activists that ensured acces-
sibility to a safe and legal abortion. In other
words, women have been losing the fight to
control their own reproductive lives ever
since they won it just 40 years ago. But the
article did make one major mistake: It made
the claim, like so many others, that Millenni-
als and young people don't care about access
to abortion care. +
That's simply not true.
I am a Millennial who is fully committed to
ensuring safe and affordable abortion access to
women all over the United States. However, I'm
only one of hundreds on this campus and just
one of thousands in-the nation.
It's understandable why some might think
Millennials are no longer present in the fight for
abortion access. We aren't just abortion-rights
activists like our mothers and grandmothers
had been. We are many other things as well.
We are students, friends and teenagers. We are
organizers, student leaders and social media
experts. It's only because of the generation of
abortion activists before us that we can claim
each and every one of these roles all at the same
time. It'sbecause of the courageous work of our
predecessors that Millennials no longer have
to focus all of their energy and efforts solely on
establishing the legality of abortion.
Isn't this what our mothers and grandmoth-
ers worked for all those years, so that one day
women could take for granted the right to
decide when and if to have children? Didn't
they want us to live in a country where women
- and men - had access to affordable contra-
ception and, when needed, be assured that a

safe and affordable abortion would be avail-
able?
To say that Millennials are less "commit-
ted" or "present" in the fight to ensure safe and
legal access to abortion is simply false. We're
out there.
Because we have to be.
Unfortunately, the dreams of our mothers
and grandmothers have yet to be realized, so
we carry on. We continue to push back against
the dehumanizing restrictions of abortion care,
the threats to providers and their patients and
the efforts to stigmatize and isolate women
who get abortions.
Let me tell you about Millennials who are for
abortion care. We are passionate, engaged and
entrenched in the fight for abortion access. We
see that in order to uphold the right to abortion
care we must ensure that it's available, afford-
able and free of burdensome hurdles.
we are not alone. Millennials all over the
country are standing up for abortion access
- activists, clinic escorts, hotline volunteers,
directors of abortion funds, bloggers and more.
To move forward and finally realize the
dream of so many decades, we must acknowl-
edge that the world has changed. We are
fighting on much different terrain now than
our mothers and grandmothers. Millennials
are fighting not only to ensure that the legal-
ity of abortion remains upheld, but that it's an
attainable reality for all women.
That means that abortion care is affordable,
that clinics are easy to get to, that we put a stop
to needless hurdles such as waiting periods
and notifications, and that we reduce stigma
so no woman is made to feel alone or ashamed.
So, I just want to let it be known that we are
here and that we are fighting. We will not stop
until the dream is fully realized - so no woman
ever again has to question her opportunities,
values or her future because of restrictions to
reproductive choice.

Sports fans share in the same
emotional rollercoaster that
athletes experience each
game day. We
immerse our-
selves in these

lenges, indi-
vidual statistics
and personal
lives. Though 1
some people TIMOTHY
might question BURROUGHS
this irrational
dedication to
competition,
athletics allow us to share in one of
the purest examples of the human
experience. This combination of
physical exertion and raw emotion
makes it impossible to not romanti-
cize sports.
This year, University of Notre
Dame linebacker Manti Te'o repre-
sented the emotional struggle and
accomplishment that we love to see
in sports. However, recent develop-
ments have revealed that his story
was an elaborate hoax. Te'o's "rela-
tionship" with girlfriend Lennay
Kekua came to an end when she lost
her fight with leukemia, just after
the passing of Te'o's grandmother.
The linebacker's inspiring story
was the tragedy of the season until
last week, when Deadspin published
an article that questioned Kekua's
existence. It was soon discovered
Te'o never actually met Kekua and
their relationship consisted solely
of Internet interactions and phone
calls. Te'o issued statements and
gave an off-camera interview to
ESPN in which he claimed to be a
victim of an elaborate practical joke.
He asserted no prior knowledge of
the hoax and apologized for embel-
lishing details and misleading the
public about his relationship.
Sports fans are bewildered - the
most emotionally moving sports
feature of the year has quickly been
reduced to an Internet relationship

with a fictitious girlfriend. This has
pushed many to question the jour-
nalistic integrity and credibility of
ESPN, Sports Illustrated and other
sports publications.
In a Jan. 17 column in The Michi-
gan Daily, Adrienne Roberts con-
cludes, "to get stories like these,
fact-checking is often ignored and
stories of heartbreak and hero-
ism outweigh the not-so-flattering
truth." I admit that I, too, was
appalled by industry-leading publi-
cations cutting corners and ignoring
the most basic fact-check. Journal-
istic integrity is the responsibility of
media outlets, and I'm disappointed
in these reporters and organizations
for their lack of due-diligence.
In her column, Roberts goes on
to argue, "It's time we re-evaluate
how we think about athletes' worth
and how we judge them as players.
An athlete's personal heartbreak
shouldn't affect how much media
attention he gets before the draft."
I understand that athletes don't
always live up to the extremely high
standards fans hold them to. Tak-
ing performance-enhancing drugs
and lying have been the down-
fall of many sports idols, but that
shouldn't belittle the importance of
sports feature articles, such as the
Te'o story.
For fans, it's the stories of obsta-
cles athletes face that illustrate their
humanity. Sports are much more
than a box score. By exploring the
lives of those who play, we give ath-
letics new emotional meaning.
The fabrication and false report-
ing of these stories show a lack of
effort by reporters. Stories with-
out any substance are perhaps the
worst offenders. One of the best
examples is the countless hours of
coverage dedicated to Lolo Jones
during the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Many spectilated, probably cor-
rectly, that this attention wasn't
due to her athletic prowess or per-
sonal past. Instead, the media chose

to focus on her attractiveness and
self-proclaimed virginity. However,
instances of bad journalism should
not dehumanize athletes by ignor-
ing their personal lives.
We need to relish

personal success
in sports.
In Roberts's column she contin-
ues, "At the end of the day, sports
are all about a game - a game
involving highly skilled and usually
extremely dedicated athletes - but a
game nonetheless." I'd argue it was
more than just a game when Jessie
Owens won four gold medals in the
1936 Summer Olympics as a black
athlete in Nazi Germany. On a less
significant note, the publicizing of
Tiger Woods's extramarital affairs
sent him into a slump from which he
has yet to emerge. There are impor-
tant lessons to be learned in both of
these cases, and it's up to journalists
to responsibly share these stories
of humanity and adversity with the
rest of the world.
The Te'o controversy didn't have
to happen. It was simply the result
of laziness. The incident not only
left fans feeling betrayed, but also
marred one of the most remark-
able seasons in the history of college
football. We need to relish athletic
and personal success, celebrate the
heroes and despise the crooks and
liars. As anyone who has followed
Lance Armstrong's career knows, it's
never that simple, but journalists are
responsible for telling these personal
stories and letting the fans decide.

Contemplating the
inaugural poem

Richard Blanco's
piece gets rare
national spotlight
By MAX RADWIN
Daily Fine Arts Editor
It may be that I just voted for
the first time this year and I'm
still too young to really under-
stand, but I never realized that
politics was such a party: inau-
gural balls, galas, parades, mix-
ers and performances by hip-hop
stars? It sounds amazing. And
somewhere in all of that, Richard
Blanco read a poem.
I can't think of another event
in which poetry has a bigger
audience and could have a poten-
tially greater impact. On the
other hand, there's something to
be said about the fact that, even
when this was the case, the poet-
ry was still overshadowed by the
many aspects of the celebration:
Beyoned, Kelly Clarkson, James
Taylor - and I even heard the
president was there. Of course,
who's going to argue that these
things, which are.so much more
outwardly pertinent to everyday
life, should everbe overshadowed
by something so seemingly small
as a poem? Perhaps Blanco's "One
Today" fit in right where it should
have. And for that matter, I'm
grateful that poetry still has any
sort of place in the inauguration,
because it easily could not have.
After all, there is no estab-
lished tradition for having a poet
read at presidential inauguration

ceremonies; there were only four
(Robert Frost, Elizabeth Alex-
ander, Maya Angelou and Miller
Williams) invited to do so before
Blanco. Very few would have
been asking, "Hey, where's our
poem?" had he or she been left
out. But Obama is a smart enough
guy to understand how beneficial
asking a poet to read can be to
enriching such a ceremony and,
in turn, the literary community.
He actually seemed to be one of
the few people enjoying Blanco's
reading, too.
My fear that Blanco's homo-
sexuality and ethnicity would
become more important than
the poem itself was only partly
realized. There's no denying that
inviting Blanco to read comes
off as a political move. While he
is certainly worthy of the honor
(he won a PEN Open Book Award
in 2006 for "Directions to the
Beach of the Dead," among other
accolades), why not have Natasha
Trethewey (named the Poet Lau-
reate this past June - the United
States's official poet by occupa-
tion) read at the ceremony? The
simple answer is that it wouldn't
have caused quite as much of a
stir in the media. It's irrelevant
whether you love Obama's poli-
tics or you don't; the main con-
cern comes closer to asking, was
Blanco there as a political tool or
a poet? Or, maybe, was he there as
both?
Blanco and "One Today" stood
out for themselves during the
ceremony, with all of that back-
ground information seemingly
falling away as he read. The only

one who continued to put the per-
son before the poem was ABC,
whose "Inaugural Notes" about
Blanco's history and background
were more than distracting. ABC
also had a stream of tweets about
the poem running onscreen while
Blanco read - which really just
meant that those people weren't
listening at all.
My evaluation of the poem is
that it was enjoyable and it did
its job. I was put off by the way
he said, "breathe" (come on Rich,
you're not at a poetry slam), but I
didn't hate it like a lot of people
seemed to. Though I didn't love
it, either. In art, especially when
contextualized by the divisive-
ness of politics, it's easy to want
to pick a definitive stance on
whether something is good or
bad, and I've seen a lot of people
taking this approach with Blanco.
To make such a declaration is to
feel that you have a strong under-
standing of the work, which is
often not the case.
To be honest, I don't under-
stand the whole poem, and how
could I? I'd have to read it 20
more times and play with the
words and how they sound, think
about it, come back to it, etc. I
know that its expansiveness, its
image of the hardworking Ameri-
can in its many forms ("Hear: the
doors we open /for each other all
day, saying: hello, shalom, / buon
giorno, howdy, namaste, or bue-
nos dias") reminds me of Whit-
man. But that's really all I've got.
The bottom line is that it got
me thinking, it had me reflecting
and it stood for the day.

Watching "Hyde Park on
Hudson" is a bit like watching
actors who've been told to play
important his-
torical figures
in an impor-
tant period in Hyde park
history and
yet have been on Hudson
given nothing State Theater
to go on, save
for how they Focs
might imagine
these real-life characters to have
behaved and talked. In short,
we're given very little in the way
of structure, something to invest
us in these people's lives.
The story feels more suited
for cocktail party candor. "Did
you know that when the King
and Queen of England visited
the president in 1939 to ask for
America's aid in World War II,
FDR was sleeping with his sec-
retary and his distant cousin?"
Such is the story's overall thrust,
which ultimately doesn't delve
much deeper than the pages of
FDR's stamp collection, a hobby
he uses as an excuse for "alone .
time" during moments of stress.
There are, however, lovely
images of expansive green pas-
tures and meadows, the kinds
you might see in a travel bro-
chure for upstate New York,
the film's setting. There's also
a surprising moment of depth
between Franklin Roosevelt (an
always charming Bill Murray,
"Zombieland") and King George
VI, nicknamed "Bertie" (Sam-
uel West, "Van Helsing"), the
stuttering monarch portrayed
by Colin Firth in 2010's "The
King's Speech." Murray, clearly
relishing the opportunity to
show FDR's more manipulative
nature, presents himself as the
proud father Bertie has always
wanted, while the young king
confesses his terror about failing
his country in this time of great
need and, perhaps more point-
edly, failinghis wife.
Combining political savvy
with genuine warmth, FDR
gracefully takes Bertie under his
wing, while revealing a weak-
ness of his own: his reliance on
the strong women he surrounds
himself with. And yet, the facts
of the film would prove other-

its success for fear of "selling
out." You might consider Foxy-
gen's Sam France and Jonathan
Rado modern hippies, living in
a cynical, digital age, and that
wouldn't be too far from the
truth. Actually, they make their
purpose in the present quite
clear in the title of their first LP,
We Are The 21st Century Ambas-
sadors ofPeace it Music.
The album begins with "in
the Darkness," a warm track
that opens the album like a blin-
dingly optimistic sunrise (the
song name is misleading, OK).
It packs a whole lot of cheer in
a small amount of time, clinking
piano notes ringing out while
Sam France speculates, "Maybe

"It's been challenging for
me because (Susannah) can be
so dramatic and needy," said
Logue. "It's a challenge to find a
sympathetic side to her."
However, Logue later admit-
ted that it was fun to play a char-
acter so different from herself.
Director Paul Bianchi really
helped Logue in understanding
Susannah.
"His vision for the charac-
ter was the right vision. He was
a huge help in guiding me to
where she needed to be," Logue
explained. "Susannah is my
character, but it's definitely been
a collaboration between me and
Paul."
Bianchi, who's been acting
with A2CT for 10 years, is com-
mitted to keeping the play and
the characters authentic to how
the playwright Alan Ayckbourn
originally wanted it.
"As a director, my job is first
and foremost to tell a story that
the playwright intended," he
said.
But that didn't stop Bianchi
from adding his own personal
touch onto the play. He added
a few "funny bits" into the play
that he felt would fit in line with
the characters.
Pleased with how the actors
had worked with his vision over-
all, Bianchi said, "I couldn't have
asked for a better cast; they've
really brought it alive."

"The Last Stand" is American.
Sure, its director is the South
Korean Jee-woon Kim, and its
hero the Aus-
trian Arnold
Schwarzeneg-
ger - but you'd The Last
be challenged $tand
to find a movie
more red, white At Qualityl6
and blue (at and Rave
least until "A
Good Day to Lionsgate
Die Hard" is
released). "The Last Stand" pos-
sesses all the necessary elements:
ridiculously fast cars (a Corvette,
of course - this ain't "Skyfall"),
liberal interpretations of 2nd-
Amendment rights, high-cho-
lesterol diners and that weirdly
stirring spirit of defending what's
yours.
"The Last Stand" is American,
whether we like it or not.
The plot, while seemingly con-
trived, is actually original and
inherently exciting: An escaped
drug cartel leader is racingrtoward
the U.S.-Mexican border from
Arizona, with the intent of escap-
ing the FBI, in a hyper-fast car
(and the sense of speed is palpa-

ble). The final obstacle in his path
is Schwarzenegger and a band of
inept-ish deputies. Director Jee-
woon Kim ("The Good, the Bad,
the Weird") paces the story well,
and there's a sense of franticness
even if the film occasionally drags
toward the ultimate showdown.
Schwarzenegger ("The
Expendables 2"), as Ray Owens
(which is as ridiculous a name
one could ever give someone who
looks and sounds like Schwar-
zenegger), is a sort of patriarch
in the film. The town he protects
treats him as such, and his depu-
ties confide in him and admit
intimate fears. Schwarzeneg-
ger is no longer just a hero; he's
a father. This gives legitimacy
toward his actions, and while his
motivations warp later in the film
toward slightly more mundane
"revenge" and "justice" arche-
types, he still radiates an oddly
comforting protective aura.
The rest of the cast is some-
what overloaded (there seem to
be about 15 supplementary char-
acters), but never stifling. Each
personality, from Forest Whitak-
er's ("The Last King of Scotland")
stressed-out FBI agent to Jaimie
Alexander's ("Thor") hardy dep-
uty, is predictable but still pos-
sesses certain tidbits that elicit

some emotional connection. In a
perfect world, action films would
exchange their pacirig and excite-
ment for fulfilling characters, but
"The Last Stand" does a decent
job nevertheless.
As for the action, it follows the
ubiquitous action-comedy formu-
la seen in "The Expendables" or
"The Avengers." Sadly, "The Last
Stand" doesn't really ever live up
to those standards. Yeah, it's fun
to see ol' man Schwarzenegger
creakily wrestle, poking fun at,
while also reviving, old-school
action standards, but the "joke"
is getting a bit ... antiquated. Still
though, "The Last Stand" is pun-
filled in all the right ways, and
it's hard not to laugh. Also, some
scenes have a little spark of genius
hidden within (a slow-chase in
a corn field, a magnetic escape
from the police), and Jee-woon
smoothly and confidently works
his way through the flurry of bul-
lets and cars.

Hasta la
vista to the
Governator's
retirement.

So, "The Last Stand" is an
effectively made, overblown
"American" movie. What's there
to talk about? Normally nothing,
but if you follow Piers Morgan on
Twitter or watch the news ever,
you're aware of a gun-control
debate in this country. In the
movie, agrandmapulls outashot-
gun and shoots a bad guy in the
back; Schwarzenegger, looking
for firepower, must go to a civil-
ian to acquire stronger weapons.
These are things that seem plau-
sible, and that also in some sense
excite and repel.
The plot excites because these
are wholly American sequences,
and there is something powerful
about defending your home, your-
self. On the other hand, it repels
because of the destruction and
death weapons like these create -
even Schwarzenegger says in the
film he's seen enough death and -
bloodshed to last him a lifetime.
Is "The Last Stand" truly add-
ing something to the gun-control
debate? Probably not. But it still is
difficult not to question our reac-
tions to the content.
This is self-aware filmmaking,
and the title of "The Last Stand"
tells plenty about the film. It's an
ironic returnfor Schwarzenegger,
an old com'eback guised as a final
hurrah. It's a literal description of
the central conflict in the film; it
couldbe the end of "Expendable"-
type filmmaking (though hope-
fully the joke still has some kick
to it). But really, "The Last Stand"
isn't any sort of ultimate destina-
tion. Instead, it's probably just
another bump on the road.

'M' struggles from the
field against Lady Lions

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Freshman forward Mitch McGary has shown an improved shot selection over the last month as the sixth man.
sual sixth man
Mcavgrowing into biger role

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team has.fallen back to
reality. NOTEBOOK
After win-
ning a pro-
gram-best 10-straight games
- including three in confer-
ence play - the 23rd-ranked
Wolverines were handed their
first loss in conference play last
night in a 59-49 defeat to No. 8
Penn State (5-0 Big Ten, 15-3
overall).
Despite being down by eight
at halftime, Michigan (4-1,
15-3) fought back and grabbed
the lead with 14:10 remaining
in the game. But after a time-
out, the Nittany Lions went on
an 11-4 run that put them up for
good.
"I thought we kind of ran out
of gas a little bit and got care-
less with the ball," said Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico.
"(Overall) though, it was an off
shooting night."
Calling it "an off shooting
night" is an understatement.
The Wolverines hit a season-
low 27 percent of their shots,
including just 24 percent in the
second half.
"We haven't shot it like
that all year," Barnes Arico
said. "Those shots we missed
are shots we normally knock
down."
Added senior guard Jenny
Ryan: "From my point of view,
I thought every shot was going
in. I can think of three to four.
that were halfway down."
With baskets not falling,

Michigan had to try and make
stops on defense, which it did
until the last few minutes of the
first and second halves.
"(They are) a quality team
and it just works out," Barnes
Arico said. "That's probably
why they are No. 8 and we are
No. 23 at this point, because
they had four more minutes
than we did."
Michigan joined Connecti-
cut as the only teams to hold
Penn State to fewer than 60
points this season.
THOMPSON STRUGGLES
Coming off a strong perfor-
mance against Northwestern
where she hit a program-best
seven 3-pointers, senior guard
Kate Thompson hopped on the
struggle bus against Penn State.
Thompson hit her first two
3-pointers, but ended the night
3-for-14 from beyond the are
with just nine points.
"If Kate's open, she has the
green light to score," Barnes
Arico said. "She's one of thebest
shooters in the country, (but) I
think she got a little frazzled by
them and a little fatigued.
"But if she's not shooting,
then who's making it? They
need to have the confidence
and they need to know that we
believe in them and some nights
are going to be that way."
Thompson has had a season
to remember, averaging 15.4
points per game in her first year
as a starter.
But she has issues eluding
double coverage, and against
Wisconsin last Sunday, Thomp-
son was held without a 3-point-
er for the first time this season.

Her bounce-back game
against Northwestern was her
strongest showing of the sea-
son. It gives the Wolverines
hope that Thompson will find
her shot when they hit the road
to face Indiana on Thursday.
A GRAND ACHIEVEMENT
Amidst the disappoint-
ing loss to the Nittany Lions
on Monday was a bright star:
senior center Rachel Sheffer.
"I thought Rachel did a tre-
mendous job inside and showed
a great toughness about her
tonight," Barnes Arico said.
"She wasn't getting her shots
to fall, but she really did a great
job."
Sheffer ended the game with
20 points and 10 rebounds, her
fourth career 'doubl'e-double.
Her big accomplishment of the
night, however, came eight min-
utes into the second half, when
she went to the line and hit two
free throws for her 999th and
1000th career points.
"It's a great honor, but it's
just one statistic,".Sheffer said.
"You look at (it) maybe 10 years
from now and say, 'Hey, I scored
my 1,000th point."'
Sheffer's accomplishment
is even more impressive con-
sidering the size mismatch
she found under the basket. At
6-foot-1, Sheffer usually finds
herself guarding bigger players.
Penn State's Nikki Greene - at
6-foot-4 - proved to be no dif-
ferent.
"Greene has weight, height,
everything on her and Rachel
really held her own and got her
into foul trouble,".Barnes Arico
said.

Daily Sports Editor
Redshirt junior forward Jor-
dan Morgan had his hands full
with Minnesota's Trevor Mbak-
we in last Thursday's matchup
between the two top-10 teams.
Morgan was stuffed by Mbak-
we on consecutive possessions,
so Michigan coach John Beilein
immediately looked to the bench
for someone who could keep pace
with the Golden Gophers' aggres-
sive post presence.
Freshman forward Mitch
McGary subbed in for Morgan
and immediately made an impact.
He matched up evenly with
Mbakwe's size and played more
aggressively on defense than the
Wolverines' more experienced.
big man. In Michigan's 83-75 win,
the freshman put up another solid
all-around game with eight points
on 4-of-5 shooting, two rebounds
- both offensive - a blocked shot
and three steals while splitting
minutes with Morgan.
Beilein praised McGary for his
ability to keep pace with Mbakwe
and the freshman's knack for
diving for loose balls, all while
maintaining a high energy level
against Minnesota.
"You have to be physical, you
have to be able to get in those
trenches and get the rebounds,"
Beilein said. "As long as that
motor is running inside."
Though McGary is sometimes
known for his energy that he
brings to the floor - often times
he'll be the first one off the bench
to cheer for a big basket to pump

up the crowd, and he'll sprint
down the floor to get back on
defense - the Chesterton, Ind.
native is growing into a larger
role offensively than just energiz-
ing the team.
Early in the second half of the
Minnesota game, McGary shed a
screen and was open on the elbow
for a jump shot that he sank. Until
recently, the freshman's range
was limited to layups and the
occasional dunk.
"I've been working a lot with
coach Beilein on my 15-foot, mid-
range game,"he said."He's begin-
ning to trust me more to let me be
able to knock down some shots."
. At the beginning of the sea-
son, Beilein was concerned about
McGary's tendency to get in foul
trouble and was working on get-
ting his strength up to par so he
could relieve Morgan.
As a recruit, one of the con-
cerns about McGary was his
weight, and coming into this sea-
son, Beilein wanted McGary to
lose weight and increase muscle
as the season progressed - it was
one of the reasons why McGary
saw limited production early in
the season.
The freshman has gotten
stronger, and even though he still
accumulates his share of fouls,
McGary has seen an increase in
minutes. He's kept his consistent
role as sixth man, usually enter-
ing the game within the first five
minutes, and has shouldered a
majorityofthe reboundingduties.
McGary is second on the team
with 5.7 boards per game, while
Morgan pulls in 5.4 per game.

McGary, who checks in at
6-foot-10, 250 pounds, is more of
the typical big man that Beilein's
systemhas lacked in recent years.
The freshman is two inches taller
than Morgan and has become the
offensive complement to Mor-
gan's strength on defense.
Though both big men are
shooting around 60 percent from
the floor and average around six
or seven points per game, Mor-
gan has remained the starting
big man and McGary his backup.
But with the freshman's success
against some of the Big Ten's
best forwards, there's a possibil-
ity that, later in the conference
slate, Beilein would favor McGary
over Morgan in matchups against
Indiana's Cody Zeller and Michi-
gan State's Derrick Nix because
of his quickness and ability to run
the floor.
But Beilein is adamant that
McGary hasn't reached his full
potential - the coach has been
working with the freshman on
his rebounding and shot selection
and is impressed with his range
and increasing role on defense.
"(His jump shot is) something
he's got to recognize that he really
needs to work on overall," Beilein
said. "He's been working on it,
he's got to continue to work on
it, but to have a big man who can
catch a quick pick-and-roll and be
able to hit it from 15 (feet) is really
important for every team.
"Him and (I) and coach
(Bacari) Alexander spend every
workable hour in the gym. I
think he's playingbigger around
the basket, too."

Senior forward Rachel Sheffer became the 23rd Wolverine to score 1,000 career points on Monday against Penn State.

For the second year in a
row, Biondi named captain

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
On Jan. 15, senior outfield-
er Patrick Biondi was named
captain of the Michigan base-
ball team for the 2013 season,
becoming the fourth Michigan
baseball player to serve as a
two-time captain since the turn
of the 21st century.
"It means a lot because I am
respected by all my teammates
and they trust me," Biondi said.
"Being a captain at this institu-
tion means a lot, especially with
the people that came before me
here."
After earning second-team
All-Big Ten honors last season
and leading the conference with
32 stolen bases, Biondi's team-
mates made a unanimous deci-
sion to designate him as captain
for the upcoming year.
The Wolverines will look for
him to lead the team in several
offensive categories yet again
this season, including stolen
bases, hits (67), runs (44) and
on-base percentage (.408). But
first-year coach Eric Bakich says
talent and experience aren't the

aspects of a player that make a
truly great captain.
"We wanted the best per-
son to lead our team as we go
through this season," Bakich
said. "His strong desire for
Team 147 and to be a champion,
(alongside) the experience that
he has, (made it) an easy deci-
sion for him to be awarded cap-
tain for the 2013 season."
Biondi's commitment to his
team and his personal growth
are evident through his actions
during the offseason. Even
though Biondi was arguably
Michigan's most productive
player offensively last year, he
has some unfinished business to
take care of
"I'm hoping to have a bet-
ter hitting season, and I think
my (offseason) preparation will
allow that," Biondi said. "We are
all just really excited to get to
California and start the season
(next month)."
Biondi and the rest of the
Wolverines' offensive produc-
tion should be much improved
with a bit of offseason prepara-
tion, but even more so through
Bakich's instruction.

Bakich spent seven seasons
as the hitting and outfielders
coach for Vanderbilt from 2003-
10. In his final four seasons with
the Commodores, they finished
in the top three in the SEC in
team batting average. He also
helped lead soon-to-be Big Ten
opponent Maryland to a 15-win
turnaround in his three seasons
with the Terrapins. His recent
success at both Vanderbilt and
Maryland seems to have pre-
pared him well for rebuild-
ing Michigan, and his team is
thrilled to have a highly touted
coach in Ann Arbor.
Bakich might be even more
excited to be with the Wolver-
ines than his players are to have
him.
"My wife and I are blown
away everyday," Bakich said. "I
have never seen a better com-
mitment to the student athletes
and to being the best at every-
thing that exists at Michigan.
It is impressive and inspiring at
the same time."
Bakich and Biondi hope to
instill that fire and inspiration
into the rest of the Wolverine
baseball program.

Post-London, Mikulak returns to Michigan

0

By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
Sam Mikulak's 2012 Olympic
competition ended with a stuck
landing, a kiss oft the vault and
an embrace with his coach. It
was also how a new chapter of
his life began.
After finishing fifth indi-
vidually in the vault and par-
-ticipating with Team USA which
finished fifth overall, the junior
from Corona del Mar, Calif. got a
chance to take in the rest of the
Olympics as a spectator.
Instead of leaving the Olym-
pic Village to go home after he
was done competing, Mikulak
relished the opportunity to stay
with his fellow Olympic athletes,
getting a chance to talk and
interact with them.
"The coolest person I met was
Serena Williams," Mikulak said.
"She is such a superstar and she
came up to us and just started a
conversation like we were on the
same level."
Unable to attend the Opening
Ceremony since the preliminary
rounds for gymnastics were the
next day, Mikulak made ita point
to attend the Closing Ceremony.
"Gymnasts are some of the
shorter athletes there, so you
couldn't really see much. I felt
I would have been more excited
to actually see what was going
on instead of seeing the back of
tall peoples' head," Mikulak said.
"But it was awesome just being
there because, how often do you
get to go to the closing ceremony
of the Olympic Games?"
Following the closing cer-
emony, 'Mikulak and the rest
of Team USA received a king's
welcome when they returned to
the United States, complete with
fire trucks, a huge American flag
and the announcement of every
returning athlete.
He also received a similar
reaction upon returning home to
California, a welcome his family
and friends attended.

For an Olympic athlete, NCAA
champion and All-American
several times over, it would be
easy for Mikulak to focus solely
on himself and his events. But
Mikulak's focus is solely on the
team.
"Individual isn't really what I -
am focusing on," Mikulak said.
"I would love just for the team
to come out with the NCAA gold.
Right now that's all I'm going to
be focusing on and just trying to
get back as fast as I can and help
the team."
The team he is referring to is
Michigan, currently No. 2 in the
nation. It mostlikely will become
the No. 1 team in the country
soon, since it's coming off a win
at the Windy City Invitational.
This first-place finish was not
only impressive due to the fact
that they beat No. 1 Illinois and
No. 4 Ohio State, but also due to
the fact that they won it without
the help of Mikulak, who was at
the U.S. national team camp in
Colorado.
Besides a team national cham-
pionship, Mikulak also wants to
compete for the United States
once more at the 2016 Olympics
in Rio de Janiero. The timetable
for the Olympics is favorable for
Mikulak, who will only be two
years out of college. Another
advantage for Mikulak will be
working with veteran Michigan
coach Kurt Golder and the rest of
the staff in Ann Arbor.
"After I graduate, I'll stay here
with the coachingstaff and great
apparatuses here," Mikulak said.
"I think it will be a smart choice
because they led me to the Olym-
pics one time. I don't see why in
a few more years they can't do it
again."
And if all goes as planned,
Mikulak will be on the world
stage once again in 2016, hoping
he can finish his Olympic expe-
rience with a stuck landing, an
embrace with his coach and a
kiss on his shiny new Olympic
medal.

Nursing a lingering ankle
injury, Mikulak received a corti-
sone shot in his ankle soon after
returning from London. Shortly
after coming back from the ankle
injury, Mikulak tore a muscle in
his left calf during practice, leav-
ing him in a boot for close to a
month. He has been recovering
from that for three months and is
getting close to a return.
"The calf is almost healed,"
Mikulak said. "I have to start
doing landing in a week or two,
and hopefully be back tumbling
and vaulting not long after that."
The injury, however, may turn
out to be a blessing for Mikulak.
Since he couldn't vault or tumble
with the torn calf, he has had
more time to focus and improve
his ring work. Mikulak has
admitted that the rings haven't
been his strongest event, and he

expects it to improve consider-
ably when he returns.
"In my whole all-around,
everything has been great except
for my rings," Mikulak said.
"Now that I have the rings that
I have improved on significantly,
my all-around should boost quite
a good margin."
Mikulak has previous experi-
ence with turning an injury into
something positive. During the
2011 season, he broke both of
his ankles, giving him a chance
to work on one of his self-pro-
claimed weaker events, the pom-
mel horse.
"My two weakest events have
gotten a lot better over the last
few years because of my inju-
ries," Mikulak said.

Wolverines forced to
re-evaluate team goals

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
Asthisseasonhas wornon,the
:Michigan hockey team's goals
have understandably changed
a considerable
,amont. NOTEBOOK
anAccording to
- coach Red Berenson, the Wol-
kverines "can forget about first
t'place and second place (in the
CCHA)," but a first-round bye is
still in the picture. The Wolver-
ines are currently in second-to-
last in the standings, nine points
behind Alaska, which is the last
team that would receive a bye if
the season ended today.
In the CCHA playoffs, the top
five teams receive first-round
byes, the top four teams are
given a home series in addition
to the bye, while the fifth-ranked
f team starts on the road and the
ninth-, 10th- and 11th-ranked
teams play the sixth-, sev-
enth- and eighth-ranked teams,
respectively, in the tournament's
opening round.
"We're trying to get into a
playoff attitude now," Berenson
said Tuesday. "We're not cruis-
ing into the final weeks of the
schedule. We're clawing our way
into the final weeks, and that's
how we need to approach it."
Junior forward Luke Moffatt
knows that peaking at the right
time could allow the Wolverines
to makea run forthe Mason Cup.
"That's what it's coming down
to now," Moffatt said. "We're
going to have to play really well
in that CCHA Tournament and
fight for the win there."
The team took major strides
toward a more successful sec-
ond half of the season in its split
against Lake Superior State last
weekend. But a potential peak
that could help the Wolverines
extend their season might still
be far off.
"Obviously, we haven't even
come close to peaking," Beren-
son said.
Berenson cited that Alaska

Michigan coach Red Berenson thinks his team could still earn a bye.

has managed to put together
some momentum. The Nanooks
have won four straight - two
over Michigan and two over
Notre Dame, which currently
holds a share of first place in thet
league with Western Michigan.
"We're got 10 games left -
there are 30 points out there,"
Berenson said. "If we don't get
half of those points, we're not
going to make it. We've got to
play way over .500 hockey.... Top
five is possible."
"THE TRIP FROM HELL":
Long trips after road losses are
never a pleasant ordeal.
But the overnight commute
back from Sault Ste. Marie was
especially forgettable for Michi-
gan.
The team bus rolled out of
Lake Superior State's snowy
campus at 10 p.m. on Saturday,
and a trip that typically takes
five hours took well over seven
to complete. It was 5:30 a.m. by

the time the Wolverines finally
made it back to Yost Ice Arena,
having traversed through haz-
ardous driving conditions that
prompted Berenson to refer to it
as "the trip from hell."
"Did we enjoy the (opening
weekend of the) NHL?" Beren-
son deadpanned. "I watched my
first game (Monday) night."
HAIL TO THE WHO?: After
each series sweep, the Wolver-
ines have a tradition of singing
The Victors in the locker room.
Last year, they were able to do
it six times. But the Lakers' win
on Saturday night kept this sea-
son's count at zero.
"I told our team after the
game, 'Christ, I'm goingto forget
the words if we keep doing this,'
" Berenson said. "It's important.
We don't rave about it, but that's
an important part of the locker-
room mentality. How about all
the incoming freshmen? They're
goingnto forget the words."

Books are perhaps my best rela-
tionship. They're always there and
they're always interesting, new,
exciting, romantic and emotional.
Television bores me, movies are
short-lived, but books ... they stick
with you. And yet, how often do you
read? It's hard to find time, right?
But-what if you read just 20 pages a
day? Give up a few minutes ... cough
... hours ... on Facebook and pick up
one of those paper-filled thought-
makers. I promise, it's the cheapest
and most effective
anti-depeessant
you'll find.
You don't have
to believe that just

favorite objects that -
I have any authority
to deem a book wor-
thy or not worthy.
But, I am an English
major, if that credits
me at all. I'm going
to tell you what I
think, and I hope you
decide to pick one a
of these books up
and see what it does
for you.
I figured that over the holiday
break I'd be able to fit insome light
reading before hauling the novels
for my English classes across cam-
pus this semester. With the piles
of snow outside, freezing tempera-
tures and the thought of having to
see someone I knew anytime I
stepped outside of my house (Hi,
neighbors!), reading would be the
obvious wayto avoid all of it.
Much to my - and the better
majority of the West side of the
Mitten State's - dismay, the snow
was non-existent, the temperatures
were fairly mild and I'm really not

sures to read. Yet, there I found
myself. Awkwardly hunched over
my books in a blanket that made me
overheat rather than fend awaythe
cold and reading. Must be the book-
worm in me.
This winter break I came home
ready to start one book in particular
- Zadie Smith's "White Teeth.' But
I was quickly distracted from that
book by other reading suggestions
from my mother that had time lim-
its: "Going to see the movie tomor-
row ... must ... finish." Thus, I put
the Smith book aside. I started with
"The Perks of Being A Wallflower."
Yes, boo me all you want for not
having read this when I was a child,
but I was far more occupied with
"Harry Potter" and "The Princess
Diaries" (shun) to give even a nod to
this book.
The main character, Charlie, is
embodied in the words of Perks.
The style is different - disjointed
- and so is he. The stream of con-
sciousness is raw and colloquial
- a nice change of pace from those
books that require more reading
between the lines than actual read-

he thinks and feels point-blank.
. Next was Joan Didion's "Play
It As It Lays" - simply put, I am
obsessed with the female author.
Her prose is succinct and blunt and
she sugarcoats nothing - shit hap-
pens and she wants you to know
it. But "Play It As It Lays" wasn't
really a holiday-happy-feeling book,
unless you think drug abuse and
depression are equivocal to cookies
and, uh, kittens. If you like Didion,
"Plav It As It Lays" is noteworthy
to read merely to
contrast her writ-
ing before and after
J those tragic events
detailed in her
recent works.
When 4 a.m.
rolled around the
next day, I realized
as Icompleted
Maria Semple's -
"Where'd You Go
a' Bernadette" that
my sleeping pat-
tern was unpre-
dictable. But it's
not my fault! The
words on the pages
really just flew off!
"Where'd You Go
Bernadette" holds a well-deserved
place on many of the Best of 2012
book lists. The reason: it's hilari-
ous. The worst description, because
"hilarious" is overused and vague
(my English professors would not
be proud) but there's something .
to be said for ambiguity. It's filled
with snarky humor and jabs at over-
involved mothers that we all feel are
too familiar.
And with that my break began to
come to an end. I started to wander
down the road of "Downton Abbey"
and soon Zadie Smith's book had
yet to be completed. I was flustered,
but then I remembered there's

we decided to hike the John Muir Trail -
210 miles of pristine wilderness that led up
to Mount Whitney - with my twin brother
Jacob. We left Paul, far more athletically
gifted than Ethan, Jacob or I, in charge of the
planning.
"The first day is going to be fun," Paul said
with a small smile as we packed 35 pounds
of food, water and clothing into our back-
packs while huddled around a picnic table in
Yosemite Valley. Paul often thought the words

6B Wednesday, January 23 2013 // The Statement
Prof. Ralph Williams: A modern day Prospero
by Peter Shahin

An interview with Ralph Williams is a
daunting task - one I wasn't wholly
prepared for. In the Daily's online
archives, which go back just over a decade,
there are more than 90 articles that either
mention or are directly about him. This is
impressive amount for a time period that
barely scratches the surface of the half-cen-
tury Williams has spent at the University,
first as a student, then an English professor.
In those articles, there are overviews of
his involvement with the Royal Shakespeare
Company, highlights from his more famous
lectures, an analysis of his handwriting and
profiles more or less like this one.
The collection, however, doesn't seem
to capture much beyond the surface of his
achievements. He remains, for the most part,
a splendid enigma. No mention of his early
life, few mentions of a personal philosophy,
nothing about his struggles - but plenty of
triumphs - and little about the soul of the
man himself.
Williams's return to the lecture hall was
a surprise to many - though, perhaps, not to
those who know him well. He retired in 2009
with a grand send-off and a final lecture enti-
tled "How with this rage shall beauty hold a
plea?" given to a packed house at Rackham
Auditorium. In 2012, he made a much-herald-
ed return to teaching, though he had contin-
ued to be deeply involved with the University
during his absence from the classroom.
Nearly four years after that "final" lecture,
Ralph Williams is still enraged.
"There is in me a deep - shall I call it
anger? - at social injustice more widely," he
said. "Life has in many ways been gracious
to me, but the level of profligate waste of the
world's resources, the profligate destruction
of the world's peoples, is justifiably a cause for
anger. There is a question about where to put
that anger, how to deal with it in ways that
aren't sentimental, saying, 'Oh, I forgive so
it's alright."'
Of the many characters he's studied
throughout his storied career, he sees him-
self now as Prospero, the betrayed and exiled
duke from Shakespeare's "The Tempest."
Among . all of Shakespeare's characters,
Prospero is perhaps the most wronged by
the world, but he remains conciliatory and
forgiving. Against great odds, and with a bit
of magic, Prospero regains his holdings and
leaves something better for the next genera-
tion.
"That play shows a Prospero who doesn't
give over his ground, if you will," Williams
said. "He has been deeply wronged - there
is wrong in the world, and one appropriately
responds to that with something that can be
called anger. The issue of how one redirects
that with all that one can do into not only an
action and appropriate action, but beneficent
action, while retaining or re-achieving, as in
Prospero's case, a goodwill."

"I suppose from where I am, that must be
so ... in such a way as to open the way for the
next generation, even as realizing one's own
limitations in time."
Any student who has learned from Wil-
liams will know that he is unabashedly Cana-
dian. Growing up in St. Marys, Ontario, his
family later moved further to the country-
side. His mother raised him and his four sib-
lings while their father worked as a machinist
in Niagara Falls and was frequently away.
"Milton, Shakespeare, were part of the
daily vocabulary of the house," he said.
"Their phrases were part of the language of
self-expression. There was nothing preten-
tious about it ... it was just how you talked!"
r
His primary education occurred in two
one-room schoolhouses. Each day's task was
written on the blackboard as the lone teacher
roamed the room helping students with their
work. Instead of simply completingwhat was
assigned to him, Williams completed all the
other grades'-assignments too.
"Knowledge didn't come in neat little
packets," Williams grinned.
He also faced tragedy in his childhood -
one of the darkest moments of his life. As he
recalls those bleak dayshis voice weakens
and his eyes look, as they often do, into the
distance as though he is narrating his own
memory. In 1948, Bill, his brother suddenly
died from what was thought at the time to be
encephalitis.
"His last words were, 'Give me a kiss good-

bye, mother,"' Williams recalled, his expres-
sion pained.
The aftermath of his brother's death was
"real terror" for his mother. The family
wasn't sure ofhow communicable the disease
was and whether or not any of the other chil-
dren were afflicted. In the wake of the loss,
she turned to the Bible for comfort, making
each child memorize the Psalm 91:5-6.
"Thou shalt not be afraid of the terrors by
night, or the arrow that flyeth by day, and of
the pestilence that walketh in darkness ..." he
repeated from memory.
"(My early experiences) both made me
acquainted with the resonance (of) those roll-
ing phrases (and) of the comfort presented
TERRA MOLENGRAFF/Daily
there, and started a lifelong dialogue in many
ways with those texts because (they) made a
promise that didn't get fulfilled," he said. "It
said if you were a good guy, then God would
keep a pestilence from you, and God didn't
keep'pestilence from Bill. And so it started a
long clialogue about the status of those prom-
ises and the relationship between their elo-
quent majesty and the root facts of life."
His undergraduate years weren't easy,
either. He attended Andrews University in
Berrien Springs, a 7th Day Adventist institu-
tion, where he found himself stifled by a con-
servative Christian worldview.
"It was an interesting experience. By
the time I finished there, I decided I wasn't
'that,'" he said. "I actually may be one of the
last to get myself called up in front of a uni-

versity president on charges of atheism. It
wasn't true at the time, anyway, but there it
is ..."
He arrived at the University of Michigan
as a doctoral student in the mid-1960's, and
apart from a brief teaching stint at Cornell -
been here ever since.
Still, his many years of learning and grow-
ing at the University have not brought him
unrequited happiness. Aside from his broth-
er's death, Williams said grappling with the
implications of the Shoah - more commonly
known as the Holocaust - challenged his
most basic human assumptions.
"Ina life that has known a number of chal-
lenges, it is the case that the answer needs to
be related-to what's indicated in what I call
an old 'Williams-ism:' that happiness is not a
state into which you fall. It's a choice of the
will, and it's always against odds."
He looks down at his large hands and
pauses as he ruminates over the implications
of what he said.
"This means that I don't know whether
we're going, as a species, to make it," he said.
"I can't rely, you see, on notions that we are
basically good ... The Shoah took care of that.
I have no moral alternative but to try - do
you know? That trying itself, as an individual
and in relation to others, can be a source of
enduring happiness."
That famous grin reappeared, more hesi-
tantly this time. For Williams, his drive to
"try" comes from both the campus and his
students.
"There are three trees (outside of Natural
Science auditorium) that, as you go toward
them, they have the most marvelous mot-
tled bark," he said. "The mottled-ness of the
bark reminded me of the mottled-ness of
our human nature. We are creatures of the
motley. Shakespeare was intimately aware
of this... And (the trees) became, if you will,
my friends over the years. Sometimes I feel
I want to do more for my students, I want to
be worthy of my students, and some days I'd
worry, 'Am I worthy of them today? Can I be
with and for them, as I want to be? DoI know
enough?' And I'd walk by (the trees), and I'd
look at them, and I'd smile, and I'd go into
the lecture hall strengthened by their very
beauty and the reminder of the mottled-ness
of us all."'
His learning process isn't over. I didn't
ask him if he ever intended to retire again. I
didn't feel I needed to.
"When I was a man of 20, I thought to be
a.man of unchanging principle was the best
thing I could possibly be. I no longer think
that. Over the years I've changed principles,
I've jettisoned some, I hope in favor of larger,
more capacious ones. What gives me the most
joy right now is the experience in the aston-
ishing variety of ways the human good can
work itself out. That's the texture of my life
- it's ongoing."

AVALON
HOUSING:

here's a regular-looking house on
* a regular corner of a regular Ann
Arbor neighborhood that has been a
symbol of growth for residents all over the
city for the past 20 years. It's nondescript -
three stories, tan, flanked by a long porch
- but the beauty of the house lies in this
subtleness, because the lives of the tenants
inside have been anything but subtle.
Of the six units that occupy the space
inside this tan house, five have rotated
residents over the last 20 years. These
five units have held a number of people
from all walks of life. There are more dif-
ferences than similarities, but the biggest
thing these people have in common is what
brought them to Avalon' Housing: home-
lessness.
For 20 years,.Avalon has managed this
commonality, working to give the home-
less in Ann Arbor permanent shelter while
offering support services. The non-profit
has gone from the one house - six people in
six units - to more than 400 people in 280
units since its birth in 1992, often welcom-
ing individuals who would have no chance
of finding housing elsewhere in the city.
Back in the tan house on the corner of
West William and South Ashley streets -
the first residence of the Avalon founda-
tion - that sixth unit has stayed occupied
by the same man since the birth of Avalon,
the only constant in a sea of fresh faces and
stories.
His name is Paul, and that regular, tan
house saved his life.
"I don't think I would have made it with-
out Avalon, really," Paul said.
Before moving to Ann Arbor in the late
1980s, Paul lived in a house without heat,
electricity or running water for 15 years in
Detroit. The neighborhood he lived in was
full of ex-convicts, many of whom would
wind up back in prison shortly after their
release.
Paul is still missing a few teeth from that
time span, the ones he lost after he was
beaten and mugged four times in the city.
There was also a case of attempted murder
- someone who knew he was home alone
broke in and tried to kill him. Paul fought
him off, but realized he needed to be in a
safer environment.
A friend referred him to the city of Ann
Arbor, where he moved before realizing
there wasn't any affordable housing in the
city. He protested and did other advocacy
work before Avalon began, which afforded
him his own unit and forgotten luxuries
like running water and electricity - neces-
sities he hadn't lived with in almost two
decades.
Paul has recently run into health issues,
including a bout with intestinal cancer, but
is in a place where he can deal with it safely
- a place with heat, water and support.
"(Avalon is) stabilizing people's lives and
allowing them to get on with their lives
instead of being homeless, which is just one
crisis after another," Paul said. "Even if you

get into the shelter, there's a time limit and
you have to be able to get a job ... (At Ava-
lon) you can have privileges, like if you are
flat broke they will give you a bag of food or
take you to one of the food pantries or take
you to the hospital if you need it."
Before Avalon was founded in 1992, Paul
protested with the Homeless Action Com-
mittee, a group that advocated affordable
and accessible housing for the disabled in
the 1990s. While his activist career has
ceased since moving into Avalon, Paul
hopes to work again to improve homeless
housing conditions and give back to Avalon
for what they've provided him.
"They have been real good to me, and
I want to return the favor," Paul said. "I
think they care more than others, and they
aren't just doing it as a sideline. This is
their main job, and they do it pretty well."
Avalon started in the shelters, the brain-
child of a board of directors that noticed
a disconcerting pattern among their resi-
dents. The shelter had already made steps
to become more than just a place to sleep,
implementing daytime programs and two-
year transitional housing. But there was
still something missing.
People would use up their two years in
the transitional housing and generally have
righted whatever issues landed them in the
shelter to begin with - challenges such as
mental illness, addiction or domestic vio-
lence - but still couldn't afford housing
in Ann Arbor. They would land back in the
shelters and begin to deal with the same
issues that brought them there in the first
place. There were solutions to short-term
housing, but long-term was still surround-
ed by questions.
Carole McCabe, who is now the execu-
tive director of Avalon Housing, was on
that board, watching people repeat the
same losing cycle over and over again.
"We knew exactly why they were losing
their housing - because landlords couldn't
deal with the behavior problems and the
illegal subtenants and all the things that
go along with unmanaged mental illness
or substance abuse or addiction disorders,"
McCabe said. "So, we were like, 'Let's find
a better way to do this."'
The better way is Avalon. Their first
house opened in 1992 with six residents,
Paul being one of them.
Avalon is succeeding for a variety of rea-
sons, but its most successful implementa-
tion lies in what they do differently than
every other landlord in Ann Arbor.
Formally called supportive housing,
Avalon does all the things a regular land-
lord does - maintenance, repairs, manage-
ment, etc. - but also offers support services
for all their tenants. Most landlords screen
out tenants - Avalon screens high-risk ten-
ants in. They can do this because of their
support services, which are run mostly by
social workers. Even though the sessions
are voluntary, more than 80 percent of ten-
ants participate, and even the ones who

don't participate fully still use the services growing even during a recession - but
in some capacity. they are still quite a ways away from total
