Representatives 
of prevention orgs 

discuss goals, 

challenges

By TIM COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 100 anti-sexual 

assault student activists from 
14 different public and private 
colleges and universities across 
Michigan attended a conference 
in the Michigan Union Saturday 
aimed 
at 
connecting 
student 

activists 
and 
encouraging 

organizational collaboration.

The event, hosted by the 

University of Michigan’s Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center, was the first of its kind 
on campus. Organizers said it 
offered a unique opportunity for 
representatives 
from 
different 

institutions to meet with other 
student activists and share their 
experiences of working for sexual 
assault prevention organizations.

“This is the first time in history 

that all of these schools have 
come together.” Public Policy 
senior Emma Zorfass, the event 
coordinator, said. “We are trying 
to use our collective activism to 
make our respective communities 
stronger. So we are doing a lot of 
activities that involve networking, 
coming up with different ideas.”

Each school’s representatives 

participated in a Share Out session 
about their work. Schools also 
created informational guides about 
their sexual assault prevention 
organization to distribute, which 
included 
information 
about 

the number of volunteers, their 
organizational structure and their 
goals.

A focus of the Share Out was 

facilitating a dialogue between 
different types of institutions, such 
as private Christian colleges like 
Hope College in Holland, Mich., 
as well as commuter-heavy schools 
like the University of Michigan 
campuses in Flint and Dearborn. 
Hope College junior Elena Galano 
said the Christian mission of the 
college is present in the sexual 
assault prevention organization as

Community 

members discuss 

topics from Syria to

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

Daily Staff Reporters

TEDxUofM’s annual TED-

style conference, held on Friday 
in the Power Center, focused on 

change — both creating it and 
responding to it.

The 
conference 
featured 

more than 10 TED-style talks 
from Ann Arbor community 
members 
including 
Business 

Administration 
Prof. 
Wayne 

Baker, attorney Khawla Wakkaf 
and LSA junior Sam McMullen.

Reciprocity was the focus 

of Baker’s talk, in which he 
examined the paradox of people 
continually asking one another 
for what they need. To examine 
reciprocity he created and studied 
a “reciprocity ring.” Participants 

in the ring could ask for help and 
others could pay it forward.

“When we first started doing 

this, I thought that giving was 
going to be the problem,” Baker 
said. “That’s not true. Generosity 
isn’t the problem — most people 
are willing to help. The real 
problem is getting people to ask 
for what they need.”

Baker is currently working at 

an Ann Arbor startup company to 
create a reciprocity app, based on 
his research with the reciprocity 
ring. The app would allow users 
to ask for help from other users 

for various problems, Baker said.

“I think the app has real 

potential to create a big, positive 
impact on the world by spreading 
the practice of paying it forward 
far and wide,” he said.

Following Baker’s lecture the 

audience was instructed to break 
into groups of four to create 
their own reciprocity ring. They 
were then challenged to ask for 
specific, tangible requests that 
had to be delivered within an 
allotted amount of time.

Event includes 

parade with 

puppets, visual 

displays

By MADELEINE GERSON

Daily Staff Reporter

This weekend WonderFool 

Productions 
partnered 

with local businesses and 
schools, the University of 
Michigan and the city of 
Ann Arbor to celebrate the 
10th 
FestiFools. 
Students, 

families 
and 
community 

members gathered to attend 
a FoolMoon celebration on 
Friday night and FestiFools 
parade on Sunday afternoon in 
downtown Ann Arbor, where 
public art displays, music 
performances and elaborate 
costumes and puppets filled 
Main Street.

FestiFools is an Ann Arbor 

tradition founded by Shoshana 
Hurand, Lloyd Hall Scholars 
Program 
former 
student 

and Mark Tucker, the UM 

LHSP arts director, who was 
inspired to create the event 
by the art of cartapesta, also 
known 
as 
papier 
mâché, 

during his travels to Italy.

Every 
year, 
if 
festival 

attendees are sure to see giant 
paper mâché faces, glowing 
animals 
and 
performances 

like 
the 
Violin 
Monster, 

violinist Zachary Storey, who 
has performed at the event 
for the past five years. Well-
known as the Violin Monster 
for his unique performance 
and costume, he said he 
appreciates the foolishness of 
the parade, which is why he 
returns year after year.

“I enjoy the complete and 

utter foolishness,” he said. 
“I return from my winter 
migration 
every 
year 
to 

witness it.”

Ann Arbor resident Julie 

Knick who attended FestiFools 
for the first time this year, it’s 
a one-of-a-kind event that can 
only be found in a city like Ann 
Arbor.

“I really enjoy local events, 

which are unique to this area,” 

Supporters plan to 
ask administration 

for change to 

Wolverine Access

By KATHERINE CURRAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Wolverines 
for 
Preferred 

Pronouns set up a table on the 
Diag Friday afternoon to garner 
support for a petition asking the 

University of Michigan to put 
pronoun preferences on class 
rosters.

The petition addresses what 

its supporters said they believe is 
a common issue for transgender 
students at the University, as 
many 
transgender 
students 

identitfy as one gender but are 
listed as another on class rosters 
and in the University’s records.

The petition charges that 

transgender 
students 
at 
the 

University 
must 
currently 

reach out to their professors or 

GSIs on their own concerning 
their identity, or risk being 
misgendered in the classroom. 
The founder of the initiative, LSA 
junior Felix Boratyn, said the 
group wants the administration, 
specifically University Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 
and 
Kedra 

Ishop, associate vice president 
for enrollment, to create a space 
on Wolverine Access to clarify 
students’ gender in the Campus 
Personal Information section.

Boratyn

From THE MICHIGAN DAILY

On 
March 
23, 
North 

Carolina legislators passed a 
law 
prohibiting 
transgender 

and 
gender-nonconforming 

individuals 
from 
using 

bathrooms and locker rooms 
that do not match their birth-
certificate-assigned sex. The law 
has received loud and immediate 
pushback because it promotes 
blatant discrimination against 
transgender people. Republican 
lawmakers unanimously favored 
the bill on the basis of safety, 
claiming females should not be 
forced to use the same bathroom 
facilities as biological males. 
However, it passed in North 
Carolina is an unacceptable act 
of discrimination that cannot 
be 
tolerated. 
Legislators 
in 

North Carolina — and closer 
to home, both legislators in 
Michigan and administrators 
on campus — must act to protect 
the rights of transgender people 
and uphold both Title IX of the 
Education Amendments of 1972 
and the 14th Amendment’s equal 
protection clause.

Attendees rally 

around legalization 

of marijuana in 

Michigan

By SEAN DEW

For the Daily

Ann Arbor’s city limits filled 

with 
Hash 
Bash 
attendants 

Saturday who had traveled from 

across the state to participate 
in rallies advocating for lighter 
political drug restrictions and 
beyond.

The 45th iteration of the annual 

event was held at two different 
locations: 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan Diag and the Monroe 
Street Fair on Monroe Street, 
between Tappan and Oakland 
streets.

Hash 
Bash 
started 
as 
a 

grassroots movement in 1972, 
protesting the arrest of Ann Arbor 

social activist John Sinclair for 
his possession of two marijuana 
joints. The drug remains illegal 
in Michigan except for medicinal 
purposes. 
In 
Ann 
Arbor 
it 

is 
decriminalized, 
meaning 

consequences for possession are 
$25 for the first offense, $50 for the 
second and $100 for a third offense, 
though it is still illegal on campus.

Speakers for this year’s event 

included Lansing Mayor Virg 
Bernero, State Rep. Jeff Irwin 
(D–Ann Arbor) and actor Tommy 
Chong.

Despite temperatures dipping 

below 
freezing 
and 
snow, 

hundreds gathered to participate 
in a decades-old event.

Speeches 
largely 
centered 

around the beneficial attributes of 
marijuana, its long lasting effects 
on quality of life and the upcoming 
presidential election, with a large 
focus on advocating for marijuana 
legalization to be put on the 
statewide ballot in the presidential 
election. Irwin, who has been 
a 
proponent 
of 
legalization, 

proposed legislation for statewide 
legalization last year.

Darren 
McCarty, 
a 
former 

Detroit Red Wings player, spoke 
to the crowd about his personal 
struggles with alcohol and pill 
addiction, saying marijuana was 
a safe and healthy way for him to 
rebalance his life.

“It is about education, and me 

standing up here, as a full blown 
alcoholic who has fought years and 
years that demon, pills,” McCarty 
said. “Because when you play the 
game we play, the doctors will 
prescribe you anything to get you 
up, get you out there, and get you 
to bed, and that is no way to live. 
Through this plant, there is life.”

Chuck Foksel, an Ann Arbor 

resident and legalization activist 
who attended the event, has been 
working on collecting signatures 
for a petition to put marijuana to a 
statewide vote.

“I believe cannabis is something 

that is harmless, and something 
benign compared to things such 
as alcohol,” he said. “I believe it 
(legalization) could bring a large

Following the spring game 

Friday evening, University of 
Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh showed off his singing 
skills Saturday night, taking 
the stage at Hill Auditorium 
with rapper Lil Dicky to sing 
the national anthem. Multiple 
attendees posted videos and 
pictures of the Michigan football 
coach leading the crowd in song. 
The rapper wore a #88 Jake Butt 
jersey while Harbaugh sported, as 
usual, khakis and a Michigan hat. 

Lil Dicky himself retweeted a 

number of accounts—from Bleacher 

Report to the official University 
account—covering the duet. 

The rapper also tweeted from 

his own account, referencing 
Harbaugh’s appearance.

 Harbaugh also met with 

the rapper earlier on Saturday 
afternoon, posing for a picture at 
his office. 

Lil Dicky, whose real name 

is David Burd, also shared the 
stage Saturday night with Chicago 
rapper Vic Mensa. TLil Dicky, 
though, has publicly annouced his 
efforts to mix comedy and satire 
with his musical efforts, parodying 

topics like white privilege and 
rappers’ lavish lifestyles. 

Harbaugh’s appearance onstage 

yesterday comes just two months 
after “Signing of the Stars,” his 
blockbuster signing event that 
featured guests from Tom Brady 
to rapper group Migos. Harbaugh 
has gained some other onstage 
experience recently when he made 
a cameo in the University musical, 
Big Fish — and appears to have 
recovered from his 4th-place loss 
as a write-in candidate for Central 
Student Government president 
earlier in the month.

Italian fast causal restaurant 
Piada opens on State Street

Owners emphasize 
unique atmosphere, 
affordable dining 

options

By NEIL SCHWARTZ

For the Daily

The wait for a replacement to 

the state street Five Guys is over. 
Piada Italian Street Food — a 
fast, casual Italian restaurant 
— celebrated the public grand 
opening of their Ann Arbor 
location on State Street Friday.

The new restaurant is the 

third Piada in Michigan and 
the 29th in the country for the 
franchise, which is based in 
Columbus, Ohio. Other locations 
in Michigan include Troy and 
Shelby Township, in addition to 
restaurants spread out across the 
Midwest and as far south as Texas.

Piada’s concept, comparable 

to other establishments such 
as 
Chipotle 
and 
Pancheros, 

emphasizes 
speed 
and 
value 

without 
sacrificing 
quality 

or freshness to separate itself 
from other restaurants in Ann 

Arbor, according to Director of 
Marketing Matt Eisenacher.

“Where can you go for five to 10 

minutes and get calamari as fresh 
as what we have?” Eisenacher 
said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Maureen 

Wiltsee said this preparation 
concept is one of Piada’s appeals 
to her.

“I like that it’s a create-your-

own kind of meal,” said Wiltsee. 
“It’s like Subway or Pancheros, 
only 
with 
pasta 
instead 
of 

burritos”

The 
menu 
of 
Italian-style 

cuisine 
offers 
the 
option 

of 
choosing 
one 
of 
three 

customizable main courses — a 
pasta bowl, salad or piada.

The piada is the cornerstone of 

the restaurant’s menu. Consisting 
of a wrap made with thin crust 
dough, customers have the option 
of filling it with their choice of 
meats, cheeses, vegetables and 
other toppings.

“From the first point where you 

order, in two to three minutes, you 
get things like fresh salmon and 
fresh calamari,” Eisenacher said. 
“It’s the combination of quality 
and speed, which we think has 
really made us unique in the fast-

casual space.”

He also noted that Ann Arbor 

has one of the most developed 
and varied restaurant scenes in 
the country, making sense for the 
company to expand to the city. 

“One of the reasons that we 

targeted Ann Arbor is because 
we always knew that it has a 
very 
food-oriented 
culture,” 

Eisenacher said. “We hope we add 
to the foodie culture.”

In 
addition 
to 
the 
main 

customizable courses, Piada also 
offers Italian-inspired seasonal 
sides such as Tuscan kale, quinoa 
and orzo crunch.

Mike Schack, a partner of the 

restaurant and head chef, said 
Piada has a healthy appeal that 
other restaurants may not.

“It’s somewhere fast where you 

can get something good,” Schack 
said. “It’s not a greasy burger. 
It’s somewhere where you can 
be healthy and feel good about 
yourself.”

The 
Piada 
chain 
also 

emphasizes giving back to the 
local 
community, 
something 

Eisenacher believes is a vital part 
of the restaurant’s success.

“Every community we enter,

well.

“At Hope College, since it is a 

Christian school, we are focused 
on living the Christian mission,” 
Galano said. “And we believe that 
being aware of the needs of our 
students and being mindful of 
their health, well-being and safety 
goes hand-in-hand with our faith. 
If you believe that every person 
is a child of God, then you should 
believe that every person deserves 
respect and deserves to live in an 
environment where they do not 
feel threatened.”

UM-Flint senior Julia Norris 

said the nature of her campus 
as a primarily commuter school 
influences the orientation and 
goals 
of 
the 
sexual 
assault 

prevention organization there.

“We do have a small population 

of students that choose to live on 
and around campus at UMich 
Flint, but most choose to live 
away from campus,” Norris said. 
“We have roughly one-third of 
our student population that are 
non-traditional students, those 
with families, or those who work 
in addition to being students. So 
getting people to become engaged 
with campus life can be difficult. 
One way that we want to get more 
involved with our student body is 
by getting into the classroom and 
educate people on sexual assault 
and bystander intervention.”

The conference participants 

additionally listened to student 
volunteers from all participating 
schools on how each program is 
operated, and they educate the 
student body on issues of sexual 
assault, rape and sexual violence.

“It 
is 
interesting 
to 
hear 

from representatives of other 
institutions at this event,” said 
LSA freshman Eve Hillman, a 
SAPAC 
volunteer. 
“Especially 

since how established SAPAC is 
on campus here, and some other 
organizations are just getting off 
the ground. So it’s great for us 
to engage with them, but also, 
since these groups may still be 
new, they have a lot to offer. I 
have seen so many people here 
with great ideas about how to get 
different demographics of people 
on campus involved.”

Each 
institution’s 

representatives provided examples 
of 
ways 
their 
organization 

interfaced 
with 
student 

government, 
and 
university 

administration. 
In 
particular, 

effective 
communication 
with 

university policy makers was 
emphasized by each organization.

LSA junior, David Schafer, 

CSG 
president-elect, 
said 
he 

appreciated the chance to meet 
with individuals from around 
the state and talk about often 
underlooked issues.

“Now it’s just a matter of 

taking the conversations that we 
had and furthering them, and 
institutionalizing these goals,” 

Schafer said.

Keynote speaker Alex Ngo, 

a University alum who studies 
social work at the University of 
Chicago, spoke broadly about 
intersectional 
activism, 
and 

about their traumatic experiences 
with sexual assault, as well as 
struggles with marginalization as 
a genderqueer person.

Ngo 
emphasized 
the 

importance of accepting all types 
of people in student activism 
to the audience, warning that 
failing to engage society’s most 
vulnerable groups often leaves the 
most marginalized unheard and 
misunderstood.

“By speaking out and sharing 

my experiences as a survivor of 
sexual assault, I learned to heal 
from the margins, instead of 
running away from them,” Ngo 
said.

Ngo connected the topics of 

inclusion and intersectionality 
with 
the 
#BlackLivesMatter 

movement, 
a 
recent 
North 

Carolina 
law 
that 
prevents 

specific 
anti-discrimination 

rules for LGBT people for public 
accommodations and restroom 
use, and Kesha’s legal battle with 
her producer, Dr. Luke, who was 
accused of sexual assault.

Ngo ended their speech by 

urging the audience to not lose 
sight of the human side of activism.

“We have to make sure that we 

center our activism around love in 
a way that helps with everyone’s 
health and well-being,” Ngo said.

Knick said. “I am happy that 

FestiFools is so popular and so 
many people look forward to it 
every year.”

Sunday’s parade included a 

performance by the Michigan 
Marching Band and other various 
musicians. While the majority of 

the attendees were city residents, 
a 
number 
of 
UM 
students 

participated in the events. 

LSA sophomore Karly Carson 

attended 
FestiFools 
for 
the 

first time this year. Dressed in 
a joker costume, Carson said 
she was looking forward to the 
entertainment of the day.

“I am excited to see all of the 

creativity 
that 
people 
have,” 

Carson said.

Ann Arbor resident Susan 

Irwin 
has 
volunteered 
at 

FestiFools for the past two years, 
selling costumes and T-shirts 
for FoolMoon. Irwin said she 
thought the primary audience of 
FestiFools is families with young 
children.

“It’s such a fun, family-oriented 

event,” Irwin said. “It’s fun for all 
to be foolish.”

FESTIFOOLS

professors are usually well 

intentioned and a transgender 
student can e-mail a professor 
or GSI before a class about 
what gender they identify with, 
students can still be referred to 
with the wrong pronoun.

“I have had one teacher do that 

to me in front of the whole class,” 
Boratyn said. “He said she instead 
of he.”

Situations like these, he added, 

could be easily avoided if there 
were 
clarifications 
on 
class 

rosters.

Other colleges have already 

instituted this change, including 
Harvard 
University, 
Tulane 

University 
and 
University 
of 

Vermont. Social media sites such 

as Facebook also offer users the 
option to identify as transgender 
female or transgender male.

“As the leaders and best we 

should be on the forefront of this 
issue,” Boratyn said. “And I find it 
surprising that we are not.”

The petition currently has more 

than 500 signatures and attracted 
attention from students passing 
through the Diag throughout 
the day. LSA sophomore Jessica 
Drucker, who signed the petition 
Friday, said she agreed with 
the reasoning of Wolverines for 
Preferred Pronouns.

“It’s a really good cause,” 

Drucker said while signing the 
petition. “I don’t think people 
generally think about it, but it can 
make a huge difference for those it 
affects.”

The club said they are hoping 

to partner with Central Student 
Government in the near future 

to put more pressure on the 
administration to make these 
changes. 
LSA 
sophomore 

Elizabeth Marck, a member of 
the group, said CSG had already 
approached them, offering to 
help them better connect with the 
administration on the issue.

“Getting 
something 
passed 

through CSG would be incredible,” 
Marck said.

The club is hoping to continue 

to expand the petition past 500 
signatures to attract the attention 
of 
University 
administration. 

Boratyn said he does not think 
the University is intentionally 
neglecting the issue, but rather 
that it hasnt garnered significant 
attention yet.

“It’s probably not happened yet 

because this is a very big school,” 
Boratyn said. “It’s a matter of 
distance from the problem and 
prioritization of issues.”

amount of much needed tax 
revenue to the state, while at 
the same time being one of the 
largest social justice issues of 
our time. We lock up so many 
people in a cage over a plant — it 
is ridiculous.”

For 
some, 
Saturday’s 

celebration 
represented 
more 

than just the fight for legalization 
of marijuana, but the success of 
peaceful protest. LSA sophomore 
Peter Dolan said he thought 
Saturday’s 
protest 
was 
tame 

compared to other campus events.

“Compared to a game day this 

is nothing,” he said. “No one is 
drunk or passed out; everyone 
seems very respectful. It is good 
that the University lets them put 
this on, and the people are able to 
do it in way that is not disruptive.”

According to Diane Brown, 

spokesperson for the University’s 
Department of Public Safety and 
Security, the event ended with 
only two arrest and few citations 
issued throughout the day. Last 
year, three arrests were made.

“Many 
people 
perceive 
it 

(Hash Bash) as a one-day amnesty 
against laws and anything is 
allowed because of the event. It is 
not,” she said. “Political laws hold 
and can be enforced, but safety 
is the most important for our 
officers.”

we usually have very distinct 
ways of giving money back to 
local organizations” Eisenacher 
said. “We don’t have any national 
organizations that we give to. We 
allow our chefs and our locations 

to give back locally.”

Schack 
and 
Eisenacher 

added that they both believe 
the customer’s experience is 
important to Piada’s success, 
saying the attitude of the staff 
and 
the 
overall 
atmosphere 

contributes to a positive diner 
experience.

“I feel that our team wants to 

be here,” Schack said. “And that 
is something that the guests can 
feel.”

Eisenacher said he wants every 

customer to feel welcomed and a 
part of the Piada family.

“What we hope to do is make 

sure that anyone who walks 
through those doors has an 
awesome experience,” he said.

Hyde said she attended the 
event because she has seen many 
TED and TEDx talks online and 
wanted to see one in person.

“Just being able to come this 

year was kind of a must-do before 
I graduate,” Hyde said. “For me 
as a person it’s always really 
important to hear about different 
perspectives.”

Wakkaf delivered a lecture 

on the current state of the 
Syrian people and how citizens 
of the world ought to use their 
voices for people who don’t 
have the opportunity to speak 
for themselves. The region is 
currently in the middle of a civil 
war, which has resulted in over 
250,000 deaths and displaced 
over 6 million, according to the 
United Nations.

She told the story of her friend 

— a student at the University of 
Aleppo — who had to complete 
his studies in the face of constant 
violence, once walking to class 
half an hour after three of his 
neighbors had been killed by a 
bomb dropped in front of his 
apartment building.

Wakkaf said after reflecting on 

her and her friends’ experiences, 
she knew she had to create 
positive change, but not for the 
whole world and not all at once.

“I don’t have to carry the world 

on my shoulders,” Wakkaf said. 
“All I need to do is to make small 
improvement in my own corner of 
the world.”

She also spoke about the 

experience of growing up and 
becoming disenchanted with the 
possibility of making a difference 
in the world, but said the solution 
was realizing how to be content 
with making a difference in your 
own community.

“We 
can’t 
always 
travel 

thousands of miles in order to 
help someone,” she said. “But 
what we can do is open our eyes 
to the reality that suffering exists 
around us, because to change 
an ugly reality we first need to 
acknowledge its existence.”

LSA sophomore Kristy Allen, 

who is one of TEDxUofM’s three 
co-directors, said TEDxUofM 
chooses its speakers based on 
whom the staff members know 
and what new perspectives those 
people might be able to bring to 
the conference.

“It’s very much so based on our 

team just talking to people in the 
community and meeting people 
that they feel have interesting 
ideas,” Allen said.

Allen also noted TEDxUofM’s 

sense of community, and how it 
serves to connect individuals in 
new ways.

“We seek to create events that 

encourage an atmosphere that 
allows for barriers to be broken 
and people to interact on different 
levels and have conversations 
that you wouldn’t normally have 
and think about realms that 
you 
normally 
wouldn’t 
have 

considered,” she said.

LSA junior Sam McMullen 

was also a featured TEDxUofM 
speaker, talking about seven 
months in which he attempted 
to live a trash-free life. He 
encouraged 
the 
audience 
to 

embrace the challenging nature of 
tackling climate change through 
conscious lifestyle choices.

McMullen said his experience 

with living a trash-free life wasn’t 
easy, and his effort couldn’t be 
completed alone.

“By living without trash, I had 

to enlist the help of everyone 
around me,” McMullen said. “My 
professors had to agree to let me 
send in homework via e-mail. My 
wait staff had to remember not to 
put the straw in the water.”

By asking for outside help, 

McMullen felt he was at times 
imposing his personal beliefs 
onto others. He said it got easier 
once he checked his ego and 
acknowledged 
the 
fact 
that 

what he was requesting was 
unorthodox.

“The beautiful thing about this 

whole thing is that once people 
have been an accomplice to an 
act of trashless-ness, they start to 
think about their own impact,” he 
said. “We’re confronted with this 
massive issue where cause and 
effect are completely separated. 
And if you live in the developed 

world like I do, you’re probably 
never going to see the whole 
impact that your lifestyle actually 
has.”

Following the conference was 

a reception at the Ann Arbor 
Hands-On 
Museum, 
where 

conference 
participants 
were 

provided with dinner and an 
opportunity to discuss the day’s 
talks.

At the reception, University 

Psychology Prof. Thad Polk said 
he decided to deliver a TED-style 
talk because he himself is a fan of 
TED talks.

“I’ve watched a lot of TED 

talks and I’m just very inspired 
by people sharing big ideas,” Polk 
said. “When I was invited I was 
very honored and jumped at the 
chance.”

Polk said he thought students 

were drawn to TED-style talks 
because of their unique format 
and speaker intimacy.

“It seems like TED talks 

have captured a particularly 
compelling way to distill key 
ideas,” Polk said. “The speakers 
really try to condense down to, 
say, 12 to 15 minutes just one key 
idea and then focus on presenting 
it in a really passionate and 
compelling way and it’s extremely 
effective.”

Among conference attendees 

was LSA junior Reid Klootwyk, 
who went to the TEDxUofM 
conference to see old ideas in 
a new light. Klootwyk said 
the TED-style talk that most 
resonated with him was one 
regarding mental health and 
awareness by political science 
lecturer Lynn River.

“I realize that it’s a problem 

that affects a lot of students and a 
lot of people in general,” Klootwyk 
said. “It affects everyone, and it’s 
really important to know.”

He added that he walked away 

impressed 
knowing 
students 

could help create and manage 
high profile events like the TEDx 
conference.

“Students can put on a big-time 

event like this and bring people 
not only from the University, but 
all around campus together and 
share perspectives on all sorts of 
different ideas,” he said.

S

potify revolutionized how 
we listen to and discover 
music. Prior to its release, 

the 
~Youth 
of 

the 
Internet 

Age~ 
had 
to 

trawl 
through 

YouTube 
to 

listen to songs 
or 
resort 
to 

piracy. 
There 

had never been 
a 
streaming 

service 
so 

intuitive; 
the 
fact 
that 

Spotify 
was 

free launched its popularity to 
another level. The fact that I can 
search up nearly any commercially 
published song is nothing short of 
a digital miracle. While it’s easy 
to simply marvel at how great 
Spotify is, I think it’s valuable to 
take a closer look at the effects of 
Spotify both in terms of the app 
itself and the broader effects of 
consumers having so much choice. 
None of Spotify’s choices are 
innocuous. From a purely logical 
perspective, how Spotify presents 
music shouldn’t affect what we end 
up listening to; people should just 
gravitate toward the songs they 
like the most. But this isn’t the case 
— how Spotify presents songs has 
deep implications for how we listen 
to music.

***
Jay 
Z 
recently 
took 
down 

much of his music from the free 
streaming 
service, 
Spotify, 
to 

bolster his own streaming service, 
Tidal. For the Patrices and Jeffs 
(Moms and Dads). Jay Z has two 
certified classics: The Blueprint 
and Reasonable Doubt, both of 
which were taken down; his other 
work includes from great (The 
Black Album) to unmentionable. As 

an avid hip-hop fan, I was initially 
dismayed that I couldn’t listen 
to some of my favorite albums. 
However, 
eventually 
I 
found 

myself exploring much more of his 
discography, such as his criminally 
underrated 
American 
Gangster 

once those other two albums were 
removed from Spotify.

In a 2005 study, Markus Prior 

discovered that increasing media 
choice 
increases 
the 
political 

knowledge of all members of 
society, regardless of their interest 
in politics. However, those with a 
greater predilection toward politics 
learned more than others, thus 
increasing societal gaps in political 
knowledge. This effect carried 
over to other television programs. 
People interested in sports watched 
more sports; people interested in 
gossip watched more trash.

I 
think 
there’s 
a 
similar 

phenomenon at work here if we 
were to replace the different genres 
of television with different genres 
of music. Streaming services have 
increased everyone’s access to 
music, and people tend to gravitate 
toward what they already liked. 
However, crossover artists have 
their popularity reinforced.

For example, every millennial 

has a favorite Kanye song. But we 
can use this analytic framework 
to go deeper. We can substitute 
music genre with music artists. I 
gravitated toward albums I already 
liked and picked up a smattering 
of tracks from other albums. 
However, once Jay Z took his most 
acclaimed albums off Spotify and 
my choices were lessened, I began 
listening to other parts of Jay Z’s 
body of work. Reducing my choice 
in music counterintuitively allowed 
me to discover more music. It’s 
easy to view more choices as being 
intrinsically good and not delineate 

the effects of choice. This isn’t to 
say having more options is bad, but 
to put a finer point on the effect of 
having much choice.

***
I previously mentioned that 

every millennial has a favorite 
Kanye song (Shock is the only 
emotionally appropriate response 
to a Kanye neophyte; as the refrain 
goes: “You ain’t got no Yeezy?”). 
Many 
of 
us 
would 
probably 

list the same songs within our 
pantheon (“Paris,” “Bound 2,” 
“Touch the Sky”). Part of this 
is because these songs are a cut 
above the rest. However, the way 
Spotify constructs its interface 
has contributed to these songs’ 
popularity.

When one looks up on artist 

on Spotify, one of the first things 
presented is the artist’s most 
popular collection of songs. We 
naturally gravitate toward options 
that require the least effort, and the 
app’s elevation of these songs means 
that we will be pulled toward them. 
Some might respond by claiming 
that the effort required to choose 
a different song is marginal and 
shouldn’t have any effect.

This 
underestimates 
our 

susceptibility 
to 
influence. 

Putting healthy food at eye level 
at a supermarket has been shown 
to increase its consumption by 
18 
percent. 
Clearly, 
exogenous 

factors beyond our preferences 
have a profound effect on how 
we consume — both media and 
foodstuffs. Spotify is not a neutral 
force that allows us to access music 
at will, and to view it as such is 
naive. It fundamentally changes 
how we discover and interact with 
music.

O

h how I hold my high school 
days near and dear to 
my heart. How thrilling 

it was to have rules to break and 
lines to cross for the first time. 
I will always remember, with 
nostalgia, my first sips of alcohol 
and sneaking boys over while my 
parents were at work.

But no way in hell would I go 

back.

In high school, everything was 

exciting and new, but nothing 
beats liberation: the great release 
of living on my own, choosing 
my 
own 
future 
and 
being 

independent in most aspects of 
my life. Is there anything more 
satisfying to brand-new adults 
than exercising their freedom in 
any and every way they know how 
to? The answer is a resounding 
“no” from every freshman who 
just escaped helicopter parents, 
and anyone who loved watching 
“Project X.” And, inevitably, 
with this hedonistic entrance 
into adulthood sometimes comes 
sex. Lots and lots of sex. 

If there is one thing that 

all students garner from their 
college experience, no matter 
what their major is, it is the 
fact that sex is often a part of 
life. Not everyone in college 
is having sex — in fact, a large 
portion 
of 
students 
on 
our 

campus aren’t — but the topic of 
sex is a near-inescapable aspect 
of college culture. There is no 
one definition of sex, but rather 
an infinite number of ways to 
demonstrate 
intimacy. 
Some 

people define sex as kissing, 
while others may define it as 

intimate touching.

There is seldom a weekend 

that passes when I do not hear 
and partake in drama involving 
someone who hooked up with 
someone else, “hooking up” also 
being a vague term that everyone 
seems to define differently, leaving 
the specific intimate act open to 
inference. Of course none of it 
is my business, but nonetheless 
I am invested. And really, aren’t 
many of us? Still raging with the 
hormones of adolescence but free 
from its restrictions, how could 
we not talk about sex? We are at 
an age where sex is not merely an 
activity; it is an obsession. 

Our obsession with sex is not 

so depraved as is the way we talk 
about it. We oftentimes recount 
our 
sexual 
escapades 
with 

embellishment, for sure, but also 
without refrain and respect. I 
have heard far too many bedroom 
stories beginning with the words 
“this bitch.” We may gloat about 
our adventures with an arrogance 
that makes it seem like sex is not 
a two-person endeavor, but rather 
an independent crusade for the 
most awesome story to tell the next 
day. But sex isn’t independent. On 
the other end of every lie story is 
a real person — a person whose 
feelings and humanity are often 
left out of these epics. 

It’s all in good fun, as they 

say. The problem is that lines are 
being blurred: the line between 
politically correct and incorrect, 
between respect and disrespect, 
between consent and assault. 

It’s easy to talk about sex in 

the classroom, aside from the 

obvious 
discomfort. 
It’s 
easy 

to regurgitate the definition of 
consent, “a clear and unambiguous 
agreement, expressed in mutually 
understandable words or actions, 
to engage in a particular activity.” 
It’s easy to keep the words “sober 
and enthusiastic” in the back of 
your mind. What is not so easy is to 
apply them — both to yourself and 
to your friends, whose definitions 
may be blurred or forgotten.

Consent is a crucial part of 

human relationships that has too 
often become more educational 
than practical. Yes, it is sometimes 
hard to be the voice of social 
justice, as asking for consent can 
feel awkward or embarrassing. 
But there is an easy fix: Grow up. 
You are not an adult until you 
learn to respect other people. You 
cannot count your college years as 
free passes to be assholes, at least, 
not when it comes at the cost of the 
safety of others.

If many of us are just trying 

to find ourselves in college and 
become “real adults,” why do 
we insist on being as childish as 
possible? The real symptoms of 
growing up are respect, empathy, 
tolerance and a firm resolution 
to be kind to others. So by all 
means, go nuts; these are the 
freest years of your life. But 
respect should take precedent 
over everything. No survivor of 
sexual assault cares whether it’s 
“not cool” to talk about consent. 
If you do, maybe you shouldn’t 
be having sex at all.

Why we left Detroit

 TO THE DAILY:

Overall, I enjoyed Anay Kaytal’s article 

on the J. L. Hudson department store from 
Detroit’s past. However, when he states, 
“People who once called Detroit home 
ended up fleeing at the slightest indica-
tions of trouble,” he shows not only an utter 
ignorance of the changes that happened 
in Detroit after the 1967 riots, but also his 
naiveté about people leaving homes they 
had lived in for decades.

My parents, like many other Detroiters, 

never wanted to leave Detroit. Detroit had a 
huge middle class, and the large majority of 
Detroiters owned their homes. Apartment 
dwellers were rare. The bus system was fan-
tastic then — so good that my father never 
drove nor owned a car. He took a couple 
buses to work six days a week.

However, things changed quickly in my 

parents’ Detroit neighborhood after the 
riots. The crime rate increased dramatically. 
New people moving into the neighborhood 
owned guns, most of them for protection. 
But not my family. Once in the late ’70s, my 
father was walking the block and a half from 

the bus stop to our little ranch house after 
work when two people accosted him right 
in front of our house to rob him. They had a 
sawed-off shotgun pointed at him to ensure 
their success. Then, one of them stuck the 
shotgun up his nose and said, “Let’s waste 
this …” Right in front of my father they pro-
ceeded to argue with each other on whether 
or not to blow his brains out. 

Luckily, they didn’t kill him. However, my 

father never recovered fully from the emo-
tional trauma. My parents ended up leaving 
the home they loved. Many other lifelong 
Detroiters left Detroit because either they 
didn’t want to go through an experience like 
this or they did have such a traumatic expe-
rience. Being so overwhelmed by so much 
crime, the Detroit Police Department never 
caught these sorry excuses for people. And 
this is fleeing Detroit at the slightest indica-
tion of trouble the author is referring to?

It was not just a slight indication of 

trouble that caused people to leave Detroit. 
Rather, it was the serious crime that erupt-
ed there that pushed people from the places 
they once called home.

2010, the Michi-
gan 
Student 

Assembly passed 
a 
resolution 

changing the lan-

guage of the Statement of Student Rights 
and Responsibilities to be gender-neutral. 
However, this doesn’t do enough to ensure 
equality on our campus. Transgender rights 
deserve continued efforts. One start would 
be to listen to the voices of signatories to 
a petition launched by the student group 
Wolverines for Preferred Pronouns, which 
advocated for students’ preferred pronouns 
to appear on class rosters. Though Title IX 
ensures that students have the right to use 
the restroom aligning to their gender iden-
tity, the Office of Student Life and the State-
ment of Student Rights and Responsibilities 
should explicitly state that transgender stu-
dents can use any bathroom on campus they 
feel most comfortable using. The adminis-
tration must set this precedent to ensure 
gender-inclusive policies are consistently 
upheld in our University community. 

If the student petition is approved, 

Wolverine Access would have a space for 
students to choose which pronoun they 
prefer teachers to use on classroom ros-
ters. This would enforce respectful treat-
ment from teachers and classmates for 
all transgender students and reduce the 
stress of transgender students having to 
notify their teachers on their own of their 
pronoun preference. Other universities, 
including Harvard University and the 
University of California, Berkeley, have 
already taken steps to provide students 
with options like these. Specifically, 
Berkeley provides six different options 
for students to choose on their applica-
tion forms: male, female, trans male, 
trans female, gender queer/gender non-
conforming or a different identity.

The University currently offers option-

al gender-inclusive housing, and East 
Quad Residence Hall hosts the Gender 
Inclusive Living Experience. Gender-
inclusive bathrooms are located around 
campus and are featured in some dorms, 
but not all. In addition, access to these 
facilities are often restricted — especially 
in living spaces. As well, inside all dorms 
(including ones with gender-inclusive 
bathrooms), students must use a housing 
key card to access any restroom.

Will Sherry, Director of the Spectrum 

Center, said the University allows stu-
dents to self-designate their gender, but 
each student is assigned bathroom access 
in residence halls based on their current 
legal sex. Therefore, you are assigned 
bathroom access based on this legal sex 
and granted access to one of two gender-
specific restrooms. When neither male 
nor female restrooms fulfill a student’s 
needs, the current practice is that the 
student must contact their hall director 
to gain access to gender-inclusive rest-
rooms. Amir Baghdadchi, the director of 
communications for University Housing, 
said the department works closely with 

the Spectrum Center to make arrange-
ments like these for students efficient.

Though it’s good University Housing 

and the Spectrum Center work closely 
together on matters pertaining to trans-
gender students’ individual dorm experi-
ences, the two must also work together 
to change the overall issue — granting 
access to bathrooms based on legal sex — 
to instead grant bathroom access aligning 
to self-designated gender.

While 
gender-inclusive 
bathrooms 

should be applauded, they are question-
able on the basis that they continue to 
separate transgender people from the 
status quo. The current process is prob-
lematic because it adds additional stress 
as students must contact their hall direc-
tor to gain this access. Additionally, 
students can misuse gender-inclusive 
restrooms (using them for sex, smoking, 
etc.), distracting from their purpose and 
potentially prompting restrictions on 
gender-inclusive hall card access.

Requiring a key card to gain bathroom 

access was meant as a safety precaution 
against break-ins when first implemented 
at the University in the 2000s, but the 
logic that gendered bathroom access is 
a necessary safety precaution suggests 
the University assumes students must be 
protected from one another in private 
spaces. This logic places disrespect as the 
expectation and respect as the rule, when 
instead the University should expect stu-
dents to be respectful toward one another 
and punish them when they aren’t. 

Many university campuses, including 

Berkeley, Brown University and Illinois 
State University, have all-gender bath-
rooms, where females and males all use 
the same facilities. This is a solution to 
problems that arise when students misuse 
gender-inclusive bathrooms, the problem of 
assuming students of different gender ori-
entations will disrespect one another when 
given the chance to comingle in private 
spaces and the problem of othering trans-
gender students that all arises from the 
bathroom distinctions the University cur-
rently provides. While we do not expect the 
University to transition to all-gender bath-
rooms overnight, it is a goal to aim toward 
in the future.

The University should ensure the protec-

tion of the rights of all students by including 
more widespread use of all gender-encom-
passing policies. These policies should 
not be limited to allowing students to use 
whichever bathroom they wish to use, but 
also include the opportunity to share cor-
rect pronouns with professors. Adminis-
trators should also look to include further 
policies in the future to ensure gender 
equality on campus. The approval of the 
Wolverines for Preferred Pronouns peti-
tion, and progress on inclusive bathrooms, 
will aid in making campus culture more 
accepting of transgender equality and show 
that our campus stands in solidarity with 
transgender people in the wake of the North 
Carolina law.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Experimental ‘We’ 
unexpected and fun

By KELLY MARTINEK

Daily Arts Writer

On Wednesday, the School of 

Music, Theatre & Dance Digital 
Music Ensemble will perform 
works by and 
inspired 
by 

composer 
Alvin Lucier at 
the University 
of 
Michigan 

Museum 
of 

Art. 
This 

performance 
is a part of 
their SMTD@
UMMA 
series. For the last seven years, 
UMMA has hosted six to eight 
SMTD 
concerts 
based 
on 

special 
exhibits, 
permanent 

installations, or simply on using 
the unique space of the museum 
as a part of this ongoing 
partnership with SMTD.

Lucier’s 
works 
include 

experimental music and sound 
installations 
that 
challenge 

the way listeners perceive and 
define music. His best-known 
work, “I am Sitting in a Room,” 
is on display at UMMA until 
mid-May. This special exhibit 
will be open for half an hour 
following Wednesday’s concert.

“This will not be your typical 

concert-going 
experience,” 

said Lisa Borgsdorf, UMMA’s 
manager of public programs. 
“You never really know what to 
expect, which is part of the fun 
of it.”

The Digital Music Ensemble 

is directed by Music Technology 

Prof. Stephen Rush. They will 
be performing one of Rush’s 
original works, “Music on the 
Fish Line,” inspired by Lucier.

The concert will be held in 

the museum apse — the large, 
high ceiling area at the center 
of the galleries in the old wing. 
There will be a fishing line, held 
taut over the length of the room 
and mic’d, which the performers 
will press in different spots 
roughly labeled zero through 
nine. On this fishing line, the 
performers will “play” their 
phone numbers, which results 
in different pitches and a 
complex, if entirely random, 
sound experience.

“I’m taking something that 

you wouldn’t think of as being 
interesting sonically, and it 
ends up sounding like a pretty 
complicated string ensemble,” 
Rush said.

The ensemble will also be 

performing two lesser known 
works by Lucier, “Vespers” 
and “Heavier than Air.” In 
“Vespers,” 
performers 
are 

blindfolded, 
roaming 
the 

performance space of the apse 
trying to find each other using 
cricket clickers, a children’s 
toy. In “Heavier than Air,” 
performers speak “meaningless 
memories” into carbon dioxide-
filled balloons. Since carbon 
dioxide is significantly heavier 
than air, listeners can’t hear the 
performers’ words clearly until 
the balloon is pointed directly at 
them, creating a unique sound 
experience. 
Guest 
composer 

Judy Dunaway, a student of 

Lucier, has collaborated with 
the ensemble to bring this work 
to life.

The Digital Music Ensemble 

was chosen by UMMA and 
SMTD to perform this concert 
because 
Rush’s 
interest 

lies in this kind of creative 
experimentation with sound 
and music, similar to Lucier’s 
work.

A key element of this kind of 

performance art is its virtual 
non-replicability. 
While 
the 

concept 
remains 
the 
same, 

each performance is somewhat 
random and, in that way, one 
of a kind. It is also the nature 
of this kind of composition 
that it doesn’t translate well 
to a recording or to a screen. 
You can listen to Lucier’s “I am 
Sitting in a Room” on YouTube, 
but it isn’t the same kind of 
experience. 

“Some things you just have to 

be there for,” Rush said.

Most performances fit into 

a distinct category — a play, 
a musical, a concert — which 
gives the audience a clue of 
what’s in store. “We are Playing 
in a Room” doesn’t quite fit into 
any of these categories, but 
Rush says there can be value in 
not knowing what to expect.

“People do really want to 

go ‘Wow! I’ve never had that 
experience before,” Rush said. 
“And we’re not just doing weird 
crap for the sake of doing weird 
crap, by the way. In the end, this 
is good music. It’s not music you 
would hear on the radio, which 
is another good reason to go.”

STYLE RECAP
NOiR brings fashion

By MARIAM SHEIKH and 

HANNAH SPARKS

Daily Style Editor and Daily Arts 

Writer

Since 1999 NOiR Runway 

Fashion has been bringing Ann 
Arbor fashion, philanthropy and 
awareness of the importance of 
community involvement. The 
University of Michigan-estab-
lished 
organization’s 
efforts 

culminate each year with their 
annual fashion show — this year, 
the theme was the “Elements.” 
The organization defines “ele-
ment” as a group of people sin-
gled out within a larger context, 
which is indicative of the orga-
nization’s commitment to their 
sense of identity. The extensive 
planning of their fashion shows 
often starts immediately after 
the closing of the previous year’s 
show.

“I’ve 
really 
seen 
(NOiR) 

revolutionize fashion and phi-
lanthropy on campus,” said 
first-year School of Social Work 
graduate student, Kendall John-
son, the president of NOiR. “We 
are a very unique organization 
in that we mix fashion and phi-
lanthropy.”

All of the proceeds from the 

show go to a particular charity 
each year.

This year, NOiR chose the 

WIN Network, formerly known 
as “Sew up the Safety Net,” to 
donate their proceeds to. The 
WIN Network is run through 
Henry Ford Health System and 
helps to reduce the infant mor-
tality rate in Detroit by provid-
ing disadvantaged new mothers 
with the necessary supportive 
resources to raise their child.

When it comes to thinking 

outside the box, Johnson notes 
that NOiR tries to “think big and 
go big.” She said one of the big-
gest challenges in holding their 
fashion shows are the costs asso-
ciated with it. Putting on a show 
of such size and scope is expen-
sive, so members of NOiR are 
constantly fundraising.

“It takes a lot of hard work and 

a lot of hours,” to host the event 
with success, Johnson said.

That work appears to be pay-

ing off, though. With a record-
breaking number of 550 tickets 
sold, the organization complete-
ly sold out for this year’s event.

The preparation for the run-

way show starts well in advance, 
such as casting calls for models. 
NOiR holds the casting calls 
as early as the fall each year. 
Though members of the orga-
nization are usually locals, the 
model calls are unique in that 
they are not exclusive to Univer-
sity students. In fact, Johnson 
noted that many of the models 
in this year’s show hailed from 

many different universities and 
colleges throughout the state, 
including 
Eastern 
Michigan 

University and Central Michi-
gan University.

To be considered to walk in 

the show, models must audi-
tion, which may include show-
casing their signature “walk.” 
Out of the 100 people who audi-
tioned this year, only 47 were 
selected. This selective process 
was clearly showcased through 
each model’s impressive run-
way presence at the show. In 
addition to being featured in 
the show, both NOiR models 
and executive board members 
were required to complete a set 
number of community service 
hours.

When it comes to the fashion 

itself, NOiR tracks the latest 
trends, and tries to cater their 
clothes to the theme of the show. 
Even amid the typical Michigan 
snowy weather, the energetic 
atmosphere inside the tent on 
Ingalls Mall never faltered. The 
fashion-week 
inspired 
event 

was meticulously planned and 
calculated, from the playlist 
executed by DJ Vincent, all the 
way down to the model walks.

“Elements” 
was 
compiled 

of ten scenes, with roughly 18 
looks per scene. Elements’s 
segments included: Earth, Air, 
Water and Fire. The final seg-
ment of the show is always the 
NOiR scene, which was more 
emblematic of the organization 
as a whole. It showcased NOiR-
inspired outfits styled by famed 
celebrity 
stylist 
Dutch 
the 

Omen, who has styled pop-cul-
ture icons such as Rihanna and 
Nicki Minaj. The four elemental 
scenes featured clothing and 
designs from local Ann Arbor 
stores, such as Bivouac, Renais-
sance and Pitaya, as well as 
handmade pieces from aspiring 
student designers. The Univer-
sity does not have a fashion or 
textiles major, so it was refresh-
ing to see designs not only from 
local stores, but trendy pieces 
that came straight from the 
minds of dedicated and young 
fashion designers.

The first scene, Earth, was a 

showcase of lingerie and Ama-
zon-themed clothes. It featured 
minimalist work from students 
with a touch of subtleness and 
craftsmanship. Featuring cami-
soles and slips with a nude pal-
ette, the lingerie models wowed 
with ornate gold headpieces and 
ethereal makeup to complete 
the look and feel of the set. A 
white lace bodysuit, in particu-
lar, stunned audience members. 
With both male and female mod-
els, this scene embraced the true 
forms of the masculine and fem-
inine bodies.

In releasing its original series, 

Hulu has bucked the trend set by 
Netflix and Amazon Prime. Unlike 
its 
competi-

tors, the net-
work puts out 
an episode of 
its show week-
ly, instead of 
putting 
out 

entire seasons 
at 
the 
same 

time. 
Hulu 

made its name 
by 
making 

episodes available as they air 
from major broadcast and cable 
networks, so this makes sense 
for them as a whole. However, in 
the case of “The Path,” the show 
might have benefited from releas-
ing more than two episodes at 
the same time. There’s nothing in 
“The Path” that’s explicitly wor-
thy of harsh criticism, but the first 
two episodes don’t do the legwork 
to support what is actually an 
intriguing premise.

“The Path” follows a wide array 

of new and old followers of a cult 
called “Meyerism.” There’s Mary 

Cox (Emma Greenwell, “Shame-
less”), a person who was “res-
cued” by the group from a tornado 
and is adjusting to life in her new 
community. Cal Roberts (Hugh 
Dancy, “Hannibal”), the de facto 
leader of the religion’s East Coast 
section, tries to expand the Mey-
erism’s reach. Meanwhile, Eddie 
Lane (Aaron Paul, “Breaking Bad”) 
struggles with his commitment to 
faith after catching the leaders in a 
lie while on a trip to the headquar-
ters to “climb the ladder,” while his 
wife, Sarah (Michelle Monaghan, 
“True Detective”), tries to figure 
out what’s going on.

Within each of these stories, 

there’s something the writers can 
grab onto and leverage to make an 
absorbing series. There are ques-
tions of faith and the meaning of 
religion in the face of personal 
struggles, but the show doesn’t 
quite do enough to play with them. 
Take Eddie, whose struggle puts 
him in conflict with his wife and 
everything he holds dear. The 
show is obviously trying to get this 
idea to stretch across the 10-epi-
sode season by having him waver 
back and forth a lot in the first 
two episodes. Once he reaches a 
point of conviction, the story may 

gain momentum. Until then, it just 
leaves me wanting more.

Without strength in the story, 

the drama leaves the intrigue-
building to its cast, which is 
brimming with talented actors 
who elevate their material. The 
series marks the return to televi-
sion of Paul, who was remark-
able throughout the entire run of 
“Breaking Bad.” All the compelling 
elements of Eddie’s early struggle 
can be attributed to Paul’s perfor-
mance. Dancy, who was robbed of 
multiple Emmys for his work on 
“Hannibal,” conveys the aura of 
mystery around his character that 
you would expect from a cult lead-
er. His storyline is going nowhere 
in the first episodes, but he’s build-
ing enough dimensions that when 
the show does decide to use his 
character, he’ll be ready.

Somewhere inside the stories 

and themes of “The Path,” there’s 
a powerful show waiting to open 
its eyes completely. As it moves 
through the first season, there’s 
potential for the payoff of these sto-
ries to resonate strongly and deep-
ly. However, it’s just not there yet 
after the first two hours. At least, 
like any good cult, the series did 
leave me wanting to learn more.

Insidious ‘Knight’

Terrence Malick’s 

latest relies on sinister 

objectification

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

There was an alternate cover 

to Kanye West’s The Life of Pablo 
that was shared on social media, 
but never used. On it, the wed-
ding photo of the smiling Afri-
can-American family used in the 
official cover is juxtaposed with 
a photo of a mostly nude white 
girl with a huge ass, accompanied 
by the caption “WHICH / ONE” 
repeated in large text in proxim-
ity to the two photos. This binary 
moral quandary — traditional 

family values vs. booty — is the 
extent of the thematic depth of 
“Knight of Cups,” an overlong, 
pseudo-ponder-
ous essay writ-
ten and directed 
by 
Terrence 

Malick.

Here 
we 

have 
a 
two-

hour film one 
can understand 
immediately 
and 
entirely 

by 
watching 

its two-minute 
trailer. Christian Bale (“The Dark 
Knight”) plays Rick, a successful 
but depressed Hollywood screen-
writer who combats his internal 
struggle to find existential pur-

pose by living a life of sex with 
rich, beautiful women.

An ensemble cast of Holly-

wood’s most gorgeous, talented 
actresses (Cate Blanchett, “The 
Tree of Life,” Natalie Portman, 
“Black Swan,” et al.) accompa-
nies Bale as his six lovers — less 
characters, more representatives 
of different aesthetics of hetero-
sexual male desire. The film’s 
emotional narrative calls for these 
women to be superficial presences 
in Rick’s life — a commentary on 
Hollywood sexual culture, to be 
sure. But none are given enough 
screen time to feel even realisti-
cally unlikable.

While the film itself is aware 

of its treatment of these women 
as sexual objects for Rick to feed 

upon, I’m not so sure the film is 
aware of its deeper, more sinister 
objectification of women as means 
to an end. Women are portrayed as 
experience points on a chivalrous 
male’s journey to enlightenment 
in a role-playing game, emotional 
chalices for the “Knight of Cups” 
to sip and discard.

It is immediately evident that 

this central narrative is meant 
to reflect the life of its writer/
director. And while I have no 
doubt other ultra-wealthy, aging 
straight white men will have little 
trouble connecting with our wan-
dering spider monkey of a pro-
tagonist, the narrative of “Knight 
of Cups” is inherently disad-
vantaged as an effective drama 
because a vast majority of the 
population won’t be able to relate 
to it. Many narratives in popular 
film concern the upper class, but 
this one in particular has an elit-
ist exclusivity inherent to its cen-
tral struggle.

Rick’s struggle is visualized 

with 
dumbfounding 
simplic-

ity. There are several sequenc-
es 
where 
Rick 
just 
stands 

longingly over beautiful natural 
vistas, silent, pondering some-
thing. These laughable moments 
call to mind a high school film 
student considering which shoot-
ing locations in his hometown 
are the “deepest.” His interac-
tions with women are juxta-
posed with interactions with his 
family (Wes Bentley, “American 
Beauty,” Brian Dennehy, “Romeo 
+ Juliet”), whom we learn little 
about besides that they’re angry 
and petty.

The film also utilizes a recur-

ring theme of “ugly Americans” 
seeping into the lifestyle of the 
wealthy. The use of images of 
unattractive and deformed peo-
ple portraying the L.A. unfortu-
nate (homeless people, robbers, 
etc.) is troublingly incoherent at 
best and disgustingly classist at 
worst. A certain shot of a crouch-
ing Christian Bale pondering next 
to a sleeping homeless woman 
like a paleontologist poring over 

a dig site was so insulting to my 
intelligence I considered leaving 
the theater. Is this supposed to be 
interesting? Is this supposed to 
be saying something meaningful 
about class? Or is this just Malick 
being 
hateful 
towards 
Black 

homeless people? The film is so 
compositionally muddled I could 
not tell you which is the case.

There are two things that save 

“Knight of Cups” from being a 
complete waste of time. Anto-
nio Banderas (“Desperado”) is 
admittedly entertaining in his 
very brief appearance as Tonio, a 
suave Hollywood playboy — the 
only character in the film I would 
want to spend any time with. 
And Emmanuel Lubezki, coming 
off of an Oscars hat trick in the

Michigan sweeps 

Indiana as Hutchins 

breaks all-time 

NCAA wins record

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

As Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins embraced her players 
one by one after the second-
ranked Wolverines’ 8-0 win 
over Indiana on Saturday, senior 
outfielders 
Olivia 
Richvalsky 

and Mary Sbonek crept up 
from behind carrying a large 
Gatorade jug.

Hutchins 
noticed 
the 

duo at the last second and 
unsuccessfully tried to escape 
the impromptu shower.

Nonetheless, she appreciated 

her players’ celebration of her 
new status as the all-time NCAA 
wins leader.

“One of my favorite things to 

do is to be with my team, and we 
were all in it together,” Hutchins 
said. “I told them, ‘This is not 
about me; this is about us.’ I think 
my team continues to represent 
every woman who’s ever played 
before them. That’s an important 
tradition to uphold, and it’s an 
important duty, one that comes 
with wearing the Block M.”

Now, 
Hutchins 
can 
add 

winningest softball coach in 
NCAA history to a list of life 
accomplishments that reach far 
beyond the softball field.

Hutchins, 
as 
a 
student, 

successfully 
pursued 
legal 

action against the Michigan 
State administration over equal 
treatment of female athletes, 
and hosts the Michigan Softball 
Academy, an annual event that 
both increases awareness about 
breast cancer and raises funds 
for the American Cancer Society.

“She’s 
more 
than 
just 
a 

softball coach,” Montemarano 
said. “She’s touched so many 
people’s lives, she’s affected my 
life in such a positive way and 
she’s there for you no matter 
what. She’s worked so hard — 
not just in softball — for women’s 
rights, to affect people’s lives. 
It’s a blessing 
to play for her 
and to learn 
from her every 
single day.”

Hutchins 

was quick to 
attribute 
her 

record to the 
efforts of those 
around her.

“It’s 
an 

achievement by the University 
of Michigan softball program,” 
she said. “It’s not a personal 
achievement. It’s a reflection of 
every person who has ever been 
involved with Michigan softball, 
including our support staff. 
Everybody’s committed to the 
same thing. We’re very proud, 
and I thought our kids were very 
excited to be a part of that.”

The victory on Saturday was 

one of three of a successful 
weekend for Michigan.

The Wolverines (5-1 Big Ten, 

27-3 overall) jumped out to 
an early 5-0 lead in the series 
opener 
Friday, 
before 
the 

Hoosiers (3-3 Big Ten, 20-13 
overall) cut the lead to two in 
the third inning. But that was 
the closest Indiana would get, 
as Michigan scored six more 
runs en route to an 11-5 victory.

After giving up two runs off 

four hits and three walks in four 
innings of pitching Friday, junior 
right-hander Megan Betsa came 
back strong Saturday.

Betsa 
tossed 
five 
innings 

of 
shutout 
ball, 
with 
nine 

strikeouts and only one walk, as 
the Wolverines cruised to a 8-0 
run-rule victory.

“I 
thought 
(Betsa) 
really 

stepped it up this weekend 
and did a great job,” Hutchins 
said. “After she struggled a 
little bit Friday night, she came 
back yesterday and was just 
really solid in really difficult 
conditions — the winds were just 
absolutely horrendous.”

In Sunday’s 

game, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
bats 
stayed 

hot. Michigan 
launched four 
home 
runs, 

including two 
grand slams.

After 

freshman 
catcher 
Alex 

Sobczak started the home run 
parade in the second inning, 
senior second baseman Sierra 
Romero followed her lead by 
launching a homer — her third 
of the weekend — to begin the 
fourth inning. Later in the

Berenson to return 
for 33rd season as 
hockey head coach 

in 2016-17

By MAX BULTMAN and 

KEVIN SANTO

Managing Sports Editor and Daily 

Sports Writer

Red Berenson is coming back.
Eight days after the Michigan 

hockey team was eliminated 
from the NCAA Tournament, 
Berenson announced at the 
team’s annual banquet Sunday 
that he would return for his 33rd 
season as head coach.

Many 
wondered 
whether 

the 2015-16 campaign would be 
Berenson’s last, but at the banquet, 
Berenson said he had spoken with 
Michigan Athletic Director Warde 
Manuel and decided to continue 
coaching the Wolverines.

“I’m 
excited 
about 
the 

direction of the program and 
the challenge of working with 
our student-athletes to improve 
on a daily basis and achieve our 
goal of winning championships,” 
Berenson said in a press release 
Sunday afternoon. “This season 
has 
been 

inspiring 
for 

our 
team, 

our staff and 
the 
fans. 

Our 
success 

has been the 
motivation to 
return to help 
the 
program 

take 
another 

step forward. 
I feel fortunate to be at Michigan 
and appreciate the support from 
our new athletic director.”

In 
early 
October, 

undergraduate assistant coach 
Mike Komisarek talked about 
how this season was a collective 
effort to get the Wolverines “back 
where we’re supposed to be.” And 
they did just that, returning to the 
NCAA Tournament this season 
after missing out on a bid the three 
previous years. But when asked if 
Michigan hockey is “back” this 
past Tuesday, he set a high bar of 
expectations going forward.

“I think it was back this year,” 

Berenson said. “But until you 
put a string of years together, 
you can’t say that.”

Now, 
it 
seems, 
Berenson 

has returned to ensure that 
terminology can be used in the 
near future.

In 2016, Berenson led the 

Wolverines to the Big Ten 
Tournament 
title 
and 
the 

team was one win away from 
the Frozen Four. Michigan’s 
season ended with a 5-2 loss to 
North Dakota in the Midwest 
Regional final. 

Berenson won the 2016 Big 

Ten Coach of the Year award, 
but his body of work goes far 

deeper than a conference coach 
of the year honor.

He took over the program 

in 1984, after Michigan had 
compiled a mediocre 92-89-8 
record in the five years prior. 
Berenson, though, saw the team 
as a diamond in the rough.

“I just recall 

my whole first 
year when I 
came in, how 
Red 
was 
so 

into it,” said 
associate head 
coach 
Billy 

Powers — who 
was a member 
of Berenson’s 
first recruiting 

class — in October. “He was so 
into it, and he was so passionate. 
… He wasn’t going to accept the 
fact that some of these guys had 
been so used to losing. I was 
always like, ‘Man, he cares more 
than half our team does.’

“His passion and his will, it 

was everyday. I was so impressed 
with how he attacked it. I 
remember that part, and through 
the good things and mostly the 
bad things — because we were 
losing — he never wavered. You 
could see like, wow, he’s gonna 
change this thing.”

Though Berenson notched a 

losing record in his first three 
seasons, he produced winning 
records in the three years that 
followed.

Then, in 1990-91, he left no 

doubt as to why he was handed 
the reigns in Yost Ice Arena.

The team bumped its 24-12-

6 record from 1889 to 34-10-3, 
and began the 22-year streak of 
consecutive NCAA Tournament 
appearances 
that 
Berenson 

catalyzed.

That run is the longest ever 

in the history of college hockey, 
and it was during that spell 
that Berenson captured his two

Former Michigan forwards Jon Horford (left) and Jordan Morgan (right) are teammates once again for the Canton Charge of the NBA Developmental League.
Opposite paths lead Morgan, 

Horford back together

CANTON, Ohio — Jordan 

Morgan didn’t sleep much during 
his first night back in the United 
States. His flight from Paris 
landed in 
Detroit on the 
evening of 
March 24, and 
he needed to 
be in Canton 
early the next 
morning for a 
physical with 
his new team, 
the Canton 
Charge of 
the NBA 
Developmental League.

His professional basketball 

career is nearly two years old 
now. He has lived in Paris and he 
has lived in Rome; he has packed 
up his entire life in less than 24 
hours to move cities and switch 
teams; and he has been told to 
pack up all of his belongings only 
to hear that a potential deal with 
a team had fallen through. At 
times, the best reminder of home 
was eating at Chipotle.

So it was a relief to Morgan 

when, upon arriving at his physical 
about 12 hours after landing in 
America, the first face he saw was 
a familiar one. It was the face of 
a teammate, an on-court rival, a 
former roommate.

When Morgan got out of 

his car to embark on his next 
basketball journey, there was Jon 
Horford, walking into the Canton 
Civic Center.

“It was a cool moment to see 

him again and say, ‘What’s up, 
man? How you doing? How is 
everything?’ ” Morgan said later 
that morning.

It has been two years since 

they last suited up together 
for Michigan, two years since 
they jockeyed for playing time 
and manned the middle for the 
Wolverines’ 2013-14 Elite Eight 
team.

Morgan and Horford were 

never the first options at 
Michigan, never the stars in the 
spotlight. The spotlight, typically, 
belonged to guys like Trey 
Burke, Tim Hardaway Jr., Mitch 
McGary, Glenn Robinson III, Nik 
Stauskas and Caris LeVert.

And now, two years later, the 

situation is similar: Five of those 
teammates are in the NBA with 
LeVert soon to join them, and 
Morgan and Horford are tasked 
with finishing out the D-League 
regular season and the playoffs 
with the Charge, an affiliate of 
the Cleveland Cavaliers.

“Me and Jordan played together 

for four years, lived together for 
two years, won championships 
together, been through 
everything,” Horford said.

This time around, a man who 

has watched them play for years 
brought them together. Like 
Morgan and Horford, Charge 
General Manager Mike Gansey 
played under John Beilein in 
the Elite Eight — he was one of 
West Virginia’s stars in 2005. He 
considers the Beileins a second 
family and lived with Beilein’s 
son, Patrick, for two years in 
Morgantown.

The D-League, by reputation, 

is known for overeager scorers 
who feel as though they can only 
make the NBA by scoring and 

standing out individually. Morgan 
and Horford both acknowledge 
that will not be their path, and 
when Gansey saw that Morgan’s 
contract had expired with his 
team in France, he reached out to 
his agent. Horford has been with 
the Charge since December.

The Michigan connections 

with the Charge don’t end with 
Horford and Morgan, either. 
Hardaway, who lived with 
Morgan and Horford in college, 
had a brief stint in Canton earlier 
this season as he returned to form 
following an injury.

“I’m going to bring in good 

guys, good teammates, good 
workers and guys that want to 
play together,” Gansey said. 

Morgan earned two 

engineering degrees in his five 
years at Michigan while Horford 
notably read books on ancient 
Chinese philosophy during 
the team’s NCAA Tournament 
runs. Stereotypical jocks they 
are not. The teammate from 
Michigan with whom Horford 
most frequently keeps in touch 
is former walk-on Eso Akunne — 
they text weekly about manga, a 
type of Japanese comic.

Former Michigan captain Josh 

Bartelstein lived with Morgan 
and Horford during the 2012-13 
season along with Hardaway, and 
believes their eclectic interests 
are derived from a desire to 
understand how the world works. 
When they were at home, away 
from basketball, they’d discuss 
politics, big business and the state 
of college athletics.

But at practice, the relationship 

was different. Throughout their 
careers, each stood in the other’s 
way of playing time.

“They went 

at each other,” 
Bartelstein 
said. “You 
would 
never know 
they were 
roommates. 
They would 
talk trash and 
go at each other on the court. 
Off the court, we were all best 
friends.”

The presence of McGary, 

who emerged as a star during 
the team’s run to the national 
championship game in 2013, 
only added to the intensity of 
the competition. Morgan had 
started most of that season, his 
fourth year in Ann Arbor, before 
McGary took over during the most 
important part of the season.

Morgan’s role was diminished 

during the team’s NCAA 
Tournament run, and coaches 
from other programs reached out 
to him after the season, trying to 
tell him he should take advantage 
of the graduate transfer rule.

But in the end, the pull of 

finishing his time at Michigan 
was too strong. He had given his 
all to the program and could not 
bring himself to leave. Even at 
his lowest point, when he had 
essentially been benched during 
the 2013 NCAA Tournament, he 
still made the best of it. He took a 
charge in the Final Four that sent 
the Wolverines to the title game. 
Then, after the highs and the lows, 
he had an opportunity to finish 
strong with a fifth and final year.

“I felt called — honestly, I 

tell you — I felt called to stay,” 
Morgan said. “There’s something 
more than what you can see 
on the surface. Something was 
telling me I needed to stay.”

He would not regret that 

decision. Morgan not only 
maintained his starting role 
during his final season, but 
Michigan wouldn’t have made 
the Elite Eight without him.

Horford faced a similar 

decision that offseason, one year 
after Morgan had decided to stay. 
Even with McGary out for much 
of the 2013-14 season, he had 
still taken a backseat to Morgan. 
He wanted to go somewhere he 
knew he’d play, somewhere he 
could have a new experience. He 
transferred to Florida for one 
final season, where he received 
the minutes increase he desired. 
Horford played 20 minutes per 
game, averaging 6.5 points and 
4.8 rebounds.

Morgan says he never gave 

Horford a hard time for this 
decision. He understood where 
his roommate was coming from 
and never even asked him exactly 
why he decided to leave.

“It was a great experience in 

terms of personal growth because 
it took me out of my comfort 
zone,” Horford said. “I had to play 
with all new teammates, I had to 
learn a new system, I had to learn 
the tendencies of other coaches 
and what they needed and what 
they liked to see.”

In some ways, Morgan 

and Horford are still chasing 
playing time, chasing new and 
better opportunities. Horford 
has played 32 games with the 
Charge, averaging 18.6 minutes, 

4.3 points and 
7.0 rebounds. 
Morgan has 
played just 
three games in 
the D-League, 
averaging 15 
minutes, 2.3 
points and 4.7 
rebounds.

The fact that they’re playing 

together now is almost mere 
coincidence. Just like they did 
for their final college seasons, 
Morgan and Horford have 
actively chosen different paths 
in terms of going about their 
professional careers.

Horford opted to play in the 

D-League instead of going to 
Europe, where he could have 
made more money. Morgan 
went to the D-League mainly 
because his other option, after his 
contract ran out in France, would 
have been to sit around and wait 
for summer league.

“It’s a chance to get 

experience, to get exposure, all of 
that,” Horford said of playing in 
the D-League. “And I’m young, I 
don’t have a family or anything, 
so money isn’t too big of a concern 
for me right now.”

In many ways, Horford said, 

playing at Michigan was more 
glamorous than playing in the 
D-League. The Wolverines 
traveled on charter flights, 
received constant access to a 
gym and a weight room, ate 
catered meals and had better 
tools for recovery after games 
and practices. The players on the 

Charge do not receive those perks.

The difficulty of pursuing a 

professional basketball career 
in leagues other than the NBA 
requires mental discipline, too. 
Horford estimates he has read 
a book given to him by Greg 
Harden, the director of athletic 
counseling at Michigan, called 
“As a Man Thinketh,” more than 
100 times to stay upbeat.

“It’s literally about how your 

thoughts create, your thoughts 
literally create your reality,” 
Horford said. “No matter what 
your circumstances, your 
situation is, if you can change 
your thoughts to more positive 
thoughts, then you can’t help but 
get positive outcomes. Like one 
of the lines is like, ‘Nothing can 
come from corn but corn, nothing 
can come from metals but metals.’ 
So if you think of your mind as a 
garden, whatever you plant in the 
garden is what you get.”

Neither Morgan nor Horford 

knows where his basketball 
career will take him. Horford 
views the NBA as his eventual 
destination, which is why he 
came to the D-League in the first 
place. Morgan holds a similar 
goal, but appreciates the way his 
basketball career has served as a 
vehicle for seeing the world.

He will suit up for the Cavs 

in summer league and will see 
his opportunities from there. 
There is a chance, albeit a small 
one, that he won’t play basketball 
next year. He feels as if he’s 
actively seeking out the right 
opportunities, not the first thing 
that comes his way.

If it doesn’t work out, he knows 

he will have plenty to fall back 
on: His two engineering degrees; 
the vast network that comes 
with being an elite student and 
an elite athlete at Michigan; and 
his charitable foundation, which 
serves underprivileged children 
in Detroit.

“Because of the foundation 

I’ve laid for myself with my 
education and my network, 
really tried to build up who I am 
off the court, because of that, I 
don’t necessarily have to rely on 
basketball to define me,” Morgan 
said. “If I don’t like the options I 
have as far as basketball goes, I 
can do something else and still be 
happy with that.”

But for now, his focus is 

basketball. After his physical 
and first shootaround with the 
Charge, he stayed on the court to 
get acquainted with the team’s 
coaching staff. The rest of the 
players had disappeared into the 
locker room, except for one.

With almost nobody else 

watching, Jordan Morgan and 
Jon Horford did drills all over 
the court. That night, before 
the team’s final home game of 
the regular season, the old-new 
teammates were inseparable 
during warmups. Morgan didn’t 
play in the game so he could get a 
little bit of rest, but he sat by the 
baseline with Horford anyway, 
chatting away.

When the game started, 

they retreated to the bench, 
teammates once again.

Michigan wins
Big Ten opener

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

Going into halftime Saturday, 

the No. 8 Michigan water polo 
team found itself in a precarious 
position. 
The 
Wolverines 
(1-0 
CWPA, 20-6 overall) were tied, 
4-4, facing No. 15 Indiana on 
the road — and if that wasn’t 
enough, it was the Hoosiers’ 
Senior Day as well.

Despite 
the 
close 
game, 

Michigan head coach Marcelo 
Leonardi still felt calm, and the 
Wolverines’ emotion matched 
his, as they came out victorious, 
11-8.

“The rigor of our schedule 

in the non-conference play has 
been able to prep us for moments 
like this,” Leonardi said.

After the halftime break, 

the Wolverines regained their 
sharpness almost immediately 
after getting back into the pool. 
Forty-five seconds into the third 
quarter, freshman defenseman 
Kim 
Johnson 
scored 
her 

first goal of the game, giving 
Michigan a lead it wouldn’t 
relinquish.

Just 40 seconds after her goal, 

Johnson was able to find senior 
attacker Kelly Martin, who put 
the ball in the back of the net to 
stretch the lead to two goals.

Johnson 
wasn’t 
done, 

though. A minute and a half 
after Martin’s goal, Johnson 
scored once again, capping off 
a 
magnificent 
three-minute 

start to the second half that 
gave Michigan a 7-4 lead. The 
Wolverines managed to score 
two more goals in the third 
quarter, including one with 
two seconds remaining, to head 
into the fourth quarter with a 

9-5 lead.

“I think the difference between 

the first half and the second half 
was that our pressure defense 
did a better job of capitalizing 
on turnovers, which created 
opportunities on the counter-
attack,” Leonardi said.

The 
fourth 
quarter 
was 

significantly less productive for 
Michigan. 
Indiana 
responded 

with two goals to narrow the lead 
to 9-6, but the Hoosiers weren’t 
able to pick up any momentum 
past that.

The Wolverines started the 

game off strong with sophomore 
attacker 
Caroline 
Anderson 

notching the first goal of the 
game.

But the rest of the half was 

characterized by back-and-forth 
scoring, with Indiana responding 
in fewer than 35 seconds to each 
of Michigan’s first three goals.

“I would’ve liked to start the 

game off a little bit sharper to 
set the tone,” Leonardi said. “But 
you have to give Indiana credit. 
They’re playing with a lot of 
emotion.”

Though Michigan is ranked in 

the top 10, it is the third highest-
ranked team from outside of 
California. But Leonardi says 
he doesn’t pay attention to the 
standings, only the RPI. The 
Wolverines could get an at-large 
bid to the NCAA Tournament at 
the end of the season if their RPI 
is high enough.

But, for safe measure, Leonardi 

would rather secure the automatic 
bid that comes with winning the 
conference tournament.

“We want to win every single 

conference game,” Leonardi said, 
“to be able to get the No. 1 seed 
at the CWPA championship, and 
then ultimately position ourselves 
to get a conference championship 
and go the NCAAs.”

WOMEN’S WATER POLO

‘M’ falls to OSU

By JORDAN HERBSTMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan women’s lacrosse 

team gave No. 18 Ohio State a scare 
in its Big 
Ten opener 
Saturday 
afternoon. 
The Wolverines played impressive 
defense throughout the game, but 
the Buckeyes proved to be too 
much in the end, winning 10-9. 

After 
going 
down 
1-0, 

Michigan (0-1 Big Ten, 5-7 
overall) flipped the switch and 
showed energy it did not appear 
to have in the first 10 minutes 
of the game. The Wolverines 
gained possession after a foul by 
Ohio State (1-0, 10-1) and pushed 
the ball upfield quickly, allowing 
junior attacker Tess Korten to 
find the net and get Michigan on 
the scoreboard. 

Only one minute later, the 

Wolverines scored again when 
junior midfielder Kim Coughlan 
wove through the defense and 
bounced a shot past the Buckeyes’ 
goalie. 
Two 
minutes 
later, 

Coughlan scored again, sniping 
the shot right past the goalie’s 
head. Up 3-1, Michigan looked as if 
it was en route to an upset victory 
over the rival Buckeyes. 

“(Getting the early lead) isn’t 

something that usually happens 
for us, but it was a great confidence 
booster,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Ulehla. “We have to own 
the first five and the last five of 
every half.” 

Ohio State would not go away 

easily, though. The Buckeyes 
scored a goal with 14 minutes left 
in the first half. Michigan held 
on to its one-point lead with the 
help of impressive defense, which 
forced Ohio State to take contested 
shots. However, the Buckeyes tired 
out the Wolverine defense and 
put a shot in the net nine minutes 
before 
halftime. 
Michigan’s 

offense had gone quiet to end the 
half and allowed another goal 
to the Buckeyes. Down one with 
just under a minute left, the 
Wolverines had an opportunity to 
tie the game, but junior midfielder 
Lauren 
Oberlander 
missed 
a 

shot with an open net in the final 

seconds of the half. 

Just as it did to start the game, 

Michigan came out strong to start 
the second half, and Korten scored 
her second goal of the day just 90 
seconds into the half to tie the 
game at four. 

Coughlan impressed as well, 

netting her third goal of the day 
and tying the game at five. Just 
two minutes after Korten’s goal, 
Coughlan scored again to give 
Michigan its first lead since early 
in the first half. 

“We were working on moving 

and cutting through, and I think it 
really showed,” Coughlan said. “I 
saw a lot more lanes today to drive 
through.” 

After taking the lead, the 

Wolverines were in a strong 
position to secure the upset, but 
Ohio State would not go down 
easily and flipped the switch on 
Michigan. The Buckeyes then 
went on a 5-0 run in the next 10 
minutes of the half, giving them a 
four-point lead, the largest of the 
day. 

Down 10-6 with nine minutes 

left, the Wolverines were forced to 
call a timeout.

“I didn’t have to say much,” 

Ulehla said. “They were the ones 
doing a lot of talking, and they 
expressed a lot of heart, and really 
at that point, it was about getting 
possession of the ball. We (weren’t 
making) 
the 
adjustments 
we 

needed to and we regrouped. They 
showed a lot of heart.” 

After 
the 
timeout, 
Korten 

looked 
determined 
to 
get 

Michigan back within striking 
distance and scored her third 
goal of the day, cutting the lead to 
three. Coughlan also continued 
her impressive offensive play, and 
her fifth goal of the game put her 
team within two with five minutes 
left to play. 

The Wolverines continued to 

attack on the offensive end, but 
the Ohio State defense remained 
tough and didn’t allow a goal 
until there were just 23 seconds 
left. But it was too little too late 
for Michigan, as the Buckeyes 
won 
the 
following 
faceoff, 

allowing them to run off the 
remaining time and earn a hard-
fought victory.

‘M’ sweeps Northwestern

By COLE ZINGAS 

Daily Sports Writer

Before a trip to Evanston this 

weekend, it seemed as if the 
Michigan 
baseball 
team 
was 

already firing on all cylinders, as 
it was undefeated on a six-game 
tear. However, the Wolverines 
showed they were capable of even 
more, tallying three dominant 
wins against Northwestern to 
open Big Ten play undefeated and 
bring their win streak to nine.

As they have all season, starting 

pitchers Oliver Jaskie and Brett 
Adcock excelled on the mound, 
earning their fifth and third wins 
of the season, respectively.

The defense was outstanding 

as well, and for the first time this 
season, it went a weekend without 
recording a single error.

But against the Wildcats, the 

Wolverine offense stole the show. 
Michigan (3-0 Big Ten, 20-5 
overall) racked up 33 runs in three 
games to sweep Northwestern.

Jaskie started the first game 

of 
a 
two-game 
doubleheader 

Friday, and almost immediately, 
he was given some room to work. 
Michigan pushed across three in 
the third, and was up 8-2 by the 
top of the fifth inning.

Sophomore 
third 
baseman 

Jake Bivens batted in a run in 
the ninth, adding to his three-
hit performance in helping the 
Wolverines to a 10-4 win.

Getting the first win of the day 

was a plus for Michigan, but the 
weekend was highlighted by a 
performance in game two Friday 
that Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
says he hasn’t seen in 20 years. 

In the top of the first, fifth-year 

senior Matt Ramsay drilled the 
first good pitch he saw over the 
fence for a two-run homer and 
then hit another one in the third. 
Ramsay wasn’t done, though.

The No. 2 hitter said the 

ball started looking as big as a 
watermelon coming out of the 
pitcher’s hand, and he gave the 
Wolverines an eight-run lead in 
the sixth with yet another two-

run blast.

“(In game one), I had some 

tough (at-bats), and had to make 
an adjustment between games 
with coach Bakich,” Ramsay said. 
“I got a 2-0 fastball my first at-bat. 
Sometimes, that’s all you need is a 
2-0 fastball to get you out of a rut.”

All in all, Ramsay was 5-for-6 

in the game, with three home runs 
and seven RBI. His contributions 
were just part of a 21-hit parade by 
the Wolverines for a 12-3 victory.

Sunday, even without a multi 

home-run effort from Ramsay, the 
Wolverines managed to plate 11 
runs on their way to an 11-9 come-
from-behind victory. 

This time, the Wildcat offense 

made itself known by getting 
ahead early in the game.

Michigan 
sophomore 
right-

hander Ryan Nutof started but 
was knocked out of the game 
early, and left-handed reliever 
Keith Lehmann gave up a grand 
slam in the third inning, putting 
Michigan down, 8-6.

The Wolverines wasted no time 

in staging a comeback, however. 
 

For the third straight game, the 
Northwestern pitching staff was 
unable to stop the stampede of hits 
from the Michigan offense. 

Senior outfielder Corey Bruder 

led the charge, slapping a liner into 
the right-field corner to score two 
runs and tie the game at eight in 
the fourth. Then, sophomore first 
baseman Drew Lugbauer put the 
Wolverines back in the lead with 
a single brought Bruder around 
from second to score.

An RBI from junior catcher 

Harrison Wenson and another 
from Bruder gave Michigan some 
insurance in the seventh.

Northwestern threatened in 

the eighth, but sophomore right-
hander Bryan Pall didn’t let 
the Wolverines squander their 
advantage. 
With 
a 
three-run 

lead, Pall came in the game with 
the bases loaded and nobody 
out. Pall worked out of the jam, 
finishing the inning with only one 
Northwestern run scoring.

“In a situation like that, we 

need strikeouts, we need pop ups 
and we need weak ground ball 
contact. Bryan gave us all of those 
things,” Bakich said.

Pall finished the deal in the 

ninth for the two-inning save and 
an 11-9 win to seal the sweep.

Besides the outburst of power 

from Ramsay on Friday, Wenson 
points to the Wolverines base-
running ability as their main 
source of runs.

“We knew we could take 

advantage of swiping bases and 
getting guys in scoring position,” 
Wenson said. “Getting people 
moving, having some extra 90s … 
we scored a lot of runs because of 
that.”

The strong performance this 

weekend adds to an even stronger 
start to the season, reaching 20 
wins through 25 games for the 
first time since the “glory days” 
of Michigan baseball in the 1980s. 
But a spectacular weekend with a 
ton of fireworks, both offensively 
and defensively, doesn’t have the 
Wolverines resting on laurels.

Michigan falls at NCAA Regionals

By LANEY BYLER

Daily Sports Writer

All across Crisler Center, eyes 

were glued to the scoreboard, 
waiting in anticipation.

The No. 7 Michigan women’s 

gymnastics 
team 
had 
been 

behind since the first rotation, 
and it needed an almost-perfect 
score during its last rotation on 
bars to tie as NCAA Ann Arbor 
Regional 
Champions, 
which 

would allow the Wolverines to 
continue on to the Super Six 
Tournament. With three scores 
of 9.950 before her, junior Nicole 
Artz was left to shoulder the 
pressure. If she could secure a 
perfect score on bars, Michigan 
would tie for first.

And while Artz and the rest of 

the Wolverines gave one of their 
best performances on bars of the 
season, the scoreboard read 9.950, 
still an almost-perfect routine.

Almost, but not enough. The 

team fell short by half of a tenth, 
scoring a 196.475 and keeping the 
Wolverines out of the Super Six.

Michigan’s loss started on 

the beam. As the first event of 
the day and the rotation where 
the 
Wolverines 
consistently 

struggle most, it proved to be a 
problem again.

Freshman Olivia Karas was the 

leadoff and had a fall in the first 
routine of the day. She ended with 
a score of 9.125. Since one score 
per rotation can be dropped, this 
wouldn’t have been a problem. 
Artz almost redeemed the team 
on beam, scoring a 9.900 and 
tying for first.

But Karas’ fall wasn’t the only 

one.

After 
a 
solid 
routine 
by 

sophomore Brianna Brown that 
resulted in a 9.850, sophomore 
Lauren Marinez was next up. 
And like Karas, she suffered a 
fall on beam, ending with a 9.150.

“I still thought we were in a 

really good place,” said Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki. “Even though 
we had counted a fall, it wasn’t 
horrible. It wasn’t like all was 
lost. However, instead of going 
out there and competing to 
win, I felt like they were a little 
bit tentative and were trying 
to compete without making 

mistakes.”

This showed in Michigan’s 

floor rotation, which followed 
a bye rotation. Michigan has 
consistently dominated on the 
floor, previously ranked No. 2 
in the nation in the event. But 
the majority of the Wolverines’ 
floor scores didn’t back up that 
high ranking.

Senior 
Lindsay 
Williams 

struggled with a few of her 
landings, losing her footing 
after a tumbling pass and almost 
stepping out of bounds. She 
ended with a 9.450. Karas had 
this same problem, bringing in 
a 9.850.

The only Michigan gymnast 

to hit a 9.900 was junior Talia 
Chiarelli. With that score, she 
tied for first and advanced to 
nationals in the event.

The Wolverines rallied in 

the last two events, starting 
with vault. Four gymnasts from 
Michigan tied for second with a 
9.850, including Chiarelli, Karas, 
senior Austin Sheppard and 

freshman Emma McLean.

However, Michigan redeemed 

itself on bars. With sophomore 
Nichelle 
Christopherson 
as 

the leadoff, she scored a 9.875, 
which Sheppard mimicked right 
after. Williams, Karas, Brown 
and Artz each managed to score 
a 9.950 for the last four routines 
of the night — but it still wasn’t 
enough.

By .050 of a point Michigan 

lost its chance to advance to 
nationals, where it would have 
tied with No. 6 Auburn and No. 
18 Stanford for first with a score 
of 196.525.

“We hit routines, but we 

gave up a tenth here and a tenth 
there,” Plocki said. “Even had we 
counted the (other) fall on beam, 
there were 10 other places I 
could have found that extra half 
a tenth.”

Despite the team’s season being 

over, three individual gymnasts 
will be advancing to nationals.

Artz, who tied for second on 

the bars and first on the beam, 

received a second-place finish 
and final all-around score of 
39.450. She will advance to 
nationals in the all-around.

“I don’t think any differently 

when I get to an event,” Artz 
said. “No matter what people 
have or haven’t done in front 
of me, I just go up there and do 
what I am capable of doing. I just 
focus on myself.”

Sophomore Brianna Brown 

will 
also 
be 
advancing 
to 

nationals for the all-around, 
taking third with a final score of 
39.375. She also tied for second 
on the uneven bars.

With her first-place finish on 

floor, Chiarelli will advance in 
the single event.

But while these three athletes 

will 
continue 
their 
season 

individually, 
the 
team’s 
end 

result was tough for Plocki.

“My heart breaks for this 

team,” Plocki said. “I think 
they just wanted it so badly that 
they tried too hard. But we win 
together and we lose together.”

Berenson currently boasts an 

835-407-89 record though 32

fielder Sierra Lawrence put the 
game out of reach with another 
grand slam in the sixth.

“I’m pleased,” Hutchins said 

of her team’s performance. “We 
got better in some areas, and 
that needs to be our focus — just 
trying to get better every day. 
Indiana is a feisty team. They’ve 
got good, young pitchers, and I 
thought our kids did a nice job. 
We played well for the most part.

“We took better cuts. We put 

Alex Sobczak back behind the 
plate, and I (think) she’s getting 
better. And I thought we jelled 
as a group. I thought we really 
played as a team. Sometimes we 
get a little individual, whether 
that’s on the mound or at the 
plate. I thought our kids were 
locked in as a team, and that’s 
when we’re at our best.”

Maize wins Spring Game

Scrimmage comes 
down to goal-line 
stand on final play

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Jim Harbaugh’s second Spring 

Game at Michigan ended the same 
way two of his team’s games did 
last season: with an all-out battle 
in the trenches at the goal line. 
Afterward, one team’s players 
raised their hands in the air with 
glee, while the others turned their 
attention toward the video board, 
begging for a reversal of the call 
on the field.

But this time, both sides were 

on the same team, and the play 
came at the end of a meaningless 
scrimmage in the grand scheme of 
the upcoming season.

When 
redshirt 
junior 

fullback 
Henry 
Poggi 
fell 

short on a last-second two-
point conversion try, it set 
off a celebration resembling 
the end of last year’s game 
at 
Minnesota, 
when 
the 

Wolverines made a similar 
game-winning goal-line stand 
as time expired.

This time, the result — Maize 

14, Blue 13 — didn’t count, but 
nobody told them. It was what 
Harbaugh has tried to instill 
every day since he arrived at 
Michigan 15 months ago: ruthless 
competition, every day.

“We want to out-compete, 

outwork 
and 
out-challenge 

whoever we play,” said redshirt 
sophomore Jabrill Peppers, who 
played on the losing Blue team. 
“And if we start that in-house, it 
just becomes habit. Because we’re 
creatures of habit. We are what we 
repeatedly do. If you’re constantly 
competing, it’s just going to be 
second nature to you.”

A year ago, the Spring Game 

was considerably less dramatic. 
Both 
teams’ 
defenses 
took 

advantage of patchwork offensive 

lines, and the teams combined for 
seven points.

This year, however, the game 

featured more highlights as the 
Wolverines continued to fight 
for playing time. The three main 
competitors 
for the starting 
quarterback 
position 
threw or ran 
for 
all 
four 

touchdowns. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 
tight end Ian 
Bunting hauled 
in a 49-yard 
reception, and 
redshirt junior running back Ty 
Isaac was the game leader in all-
purpose yards with 83.

Redshirt junior John O’Korn 

led the Blue team down the field 

in 15 plays over 7:12, scoring on 
the first series of the game. He 
converted two third downs with 
his legs and another with a 30-yard 
pass to redshirt sophomore wide 
receiver Drake Harris. Finally, 

he 
pitched 

the 
ball 
to 

redshirt junior 
quarterback 
Shane Morris, 
who 
then 

found a wide-
open fifth-year 
senior running 
back 
Drake 

Johnson 
for 

a 
touchdown 

pass.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

answered 
with 
a 
13-yard 

touchdown pass to Jake Butt on 
the ensuing possession. Speight 

later scored on a naked bootleg in 
the third quarter. The Blue team 
didn’t score again until the final 
seconds, when O’Korn scored on 
a six-yard scramble before the 
missed two-point conversion.

“We competed ’til the very 

end,” said senior running back 
De’Veon Smith. “I feel like we 
still got that touchdown — might 
have to take that to the NCAA, 
look it over. But when you see two 
teams out there competing like 
that, and know that that’s your 
team, you’re on that team — it’s a 
great feeling. You get butterflies 
in your stomach.”

For the second straight year, 

the winning team’s reward was a 
postgame steak dinner, while the 
losing team settled for spaghetti.

“It definitely made it more 

memorable,” Peppers said. “It was 
definitely more exciting. I wish 
I could have run out there, but 
ultimately they did and we didn’t. 
They finished, and we didn’t.”

Isaac took advantage of being 

the game’s featured back. He 
received 10 carries — three fewer 
than the rest of the running 
backs on both teams combined 
— and totaled 78 yards. After 
managing only one run longer 
than 15 yards last season, he 
went 30 and 29 yards on two 
plays Friday.

The five first-string offensive 

linemen were split between the 
teams, three on one and two on 
the other. But both lines held their 
own against strong defenses. 
Forty-one rushes between the 
two teams averaged 4.4 yards 
apiece. The only turnover was 
Morris’ interception on a Hail 
Mary at the end of the first half, 
and the rest of the game was even 
until the end.

Even the result, in the end, 

was insignificant. But Harbaugh 
got what he wanted: In their last 
taste of competition until fall 
camp starts in four months, the 
Wolverines treated it like a game, 
no matter the importance.

“Same approach,” Peppers said. 

“Always.”

“We’re creatures 

of habit. We 
are what we 

repeatedly do.”

Speight impresses at quarterback

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

Two days after fifth-year 

senior 
quarterback 
Jake 

Rudock led the Wolverines to 
their 41-7 victory over Florida, 
passing game coordinator Jedd 
Fisch texted the quarterbacks 
who would be taking over in 
Rudock’s absence.

Fisch’s message came in loud 

and clear: it was going to be 
the most intense battle that the 
quarterbacks had ever been in, 
but it would also be the most 
rewarding. 

Exactly four months after the 

Citrus Bowl came to its close, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Wilton 

Speight confirmed after the 
Spring Game that Fisch was 
right. It has “absolutely” been 
the most fierce competition he’s 
ever been in. 

Last season, Speight didn’t 

even play in the Spring Game. 
He was out with a groin injury 
and watched from the sidelines 
as Shane Morris headlined the 
competition. 

This year, he took the first 

snap for the Maize team, leading 
his teammates to a 14-13 victory 
over the Blue team. He was 
responsible for both of the Maize 
team’s touchdowns, completing 
a 13-yard pass to senior tight end 
Jake Butt for one and running 
into the end zone off a 6-yard 
bootleg for the other.

Though Speight dealt with 

early nerves on the field, he 
expected to get any anxiety out 
of his system in his second play. 
He knew that he was going to 
throw a “launch ball,” and with 
that pass, he planned on ridding 
himself of extra adrenaline and 
restlessness. 

On that second play, he 

overthrew 
sophomore 
Grant 

Perry, who was able to catch 
the ball, but was a yard out of 
bounds. 
After 
that, 
Speight 

completed the rest of his passes, 
going 5-for-6 for 46 yards. 

His 
renewed 
confidence 

partially 
stems 
from 
his 

performance at Minnesota last 
season, where he led a game-
winning touchdown drive when 
Rudock left the game with an 

injury. 

“(Playing against Minnesota 

last season) was huge,” Speight 
said. “Not that you live in the 
past, you never want to do that, 
but to go out there and say that, 
‘Well I’ve done this on the road 
in a hostile environment, why 
can’t I do it in Glick (Fieldhouse), 
or why can’t 
I do it in a 
Spring Game, 
or why can’t 
I do it next 
year 
versus 

Hawaii?’ 
It’s 
big 
and 

it’s kept me 
calm.” 

He also gets 

a sense of calm 
from 
Fisch, 

who has kept the quarterbacks 
composed throughout the spring 
season.

Redshirt juniors John O’Korn 

and Morris showed that sense of 
calm at times on Friday night as 
well, combining on a trick play 

for the first touchdown of the 
Spring Game. 

O’Korn started under center 

for the first snap of the game 
and led an impressive drive 
that included a 30-yard deep 
ball to redshirt sophomore wide 
receiver Drake Harris, who got 
one foot in at the 11-yard line. A 

few plays later, 
Morris 
lined 

up at receiver. 
O’Korn 
pitched 
the 
ball 
to 

Morris, 
who 

completed 
a 
nine-yard 

touchdown 
pass to fifth-
year 
senior 

Drake Johnson 

for the first score of the game.

During the second quarter, 

Morris proved that he was 
capable of leading a drive, 
completing consecutive passes 
to Joe Hewlett and Drake 
Harris 
for 
five 
and 
eight 

yards, respectively, and then 
following up with a 15-yard 
run of his own. But shortly 
after, the quarterback tailed 
off. As shown in previous 
seasons, Morris has a cannon, 
but he overthrew his next three 
targets. On 4th-and-10 with six 
seconds to go until halftime, 
Morris flung the ball into the 
air, but senior safety Dymonte 
Thomas intercepted the ball in 
the end zone.

While all three competing 

quarterbacks 
can 
scramble, 

O’Korn proved that he could 
move under pressure. In the 
final seconds, O’Korn dove into 
the end zone for a touchdown. 
The Maize team attempted a 
two-point conversion on the 
final play of the game, but the 
Blue 
team 
stuffed 
redshirt 

junior fullback Henry Poggi. 

Speight watched the final play 

next to Butt on the sidelines.

“We were able to stuff them 

and then we just had fun just 
clowning around, running around 

on the field and stuff,” Speight 
said. “It was a cool feeling.”

Though winning was nice, 

proving his ability might have 
been better. 

“(This 
spring 
camp) 
has 

really just been so fun for me,” 
Speight said. “Last year, I tore 
my groin, and the year before 
that, I was an early enrollee and 
didn’t know what was going 
on. It really wasn’t enjoyable. 
But this spring, I was healthy 
and getting reps with the ones 
and doing well and enjoying the 
game of football. 

“It was so nice to get back to 

that kind of feeling.”

The Spring Game doesn’t 

count for much except for 
bragging 
rights, 
but 
after 

the game, the winners were 
rewarded with steak and the 
losers sat down to spaghetti. 

The 
quarterback 
battle 

is far from over, but Friday 
night, Speight headed back for 
steak. O’Korn and Morris had 
spaghetti. 

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Redshirt sophomore Wilton Speight has emerged from spring camp confident with a legitimate chance to win the starting quarterback job in the fall.

“(This spring 

camp) has really 
just been so fun 

for me.”

MEN’S GYMNASTICS
‘M’ finishes last 
at Big Ten meet

McCallum’s title on 
vault not enough to 

lift Wolverines

By ANDREW EHRENBERG 

Daily Sports Writer

Friday evening, the Michigan 

men’s gymnastics team was 
outmatched in Columbus. While 
the Wolverines certainly were 
not the tournament favorite, 
they did not expect to finish 
last. However, after the team 
competition, Michigan finished 
with a total of 417.250, the lowest 
among the seven participating 
Big Ten teams.

Despite a poor outcome, head 

coach Kurt Golder remained 
focused on the positives.

“I’ve 
seen 

a 
team 
like 

Penn State do 
badly in Big 
Tens and then 
win 
NCAAs 

the 
following 

week,” Golder 
said. “I’m just 
going to try to 
restore 
their 

confidence. I’m 
always big on the positives. Take 
the good that we have and just 
build on that.”

Golder 
was 
not 
wrong. 

Despite 
a 
poor 
overall 

performance, 
Michigan 
had 

outstanding performances on 
Friday in team competition 
and then in the individual 
championships 
for 
the 
five 

Wolverines who qualified for 
the NCAA Championships.

Freshman Anthony McCallum 

was the story of the weekend 
for 
Michigan. 
McCallum 

stayed true to his No. 1 national 
ranking in vault, as he held the 
highest score both days with a 

15.400 on Friday and a 15.675 on 
Saturday, breaking his personal 
record. With a remarkably high 
degree of difficulty, McCallum 
achieved this score without a 
perfectly stuck landing. While 
satisfied 
with 
McCallum’s 

performance, Golder believes 
the All-American freshman still 
has room to grow.

“(McCallum will) probably 

just get a little more consistent at 
perfecting the landing,” Golder 
said. “The vault was already a 
very high difficulty, and it is a 
very clean vault, but he usually 
gets a three-tenths deduction on 
the landing. He can make a huge 
score if he can stick.”

According to Golder, McCallum 

has a very bright future ahead. 
However, McCallum was not the 
only Wolverine freshman honored 

over 
the 

weekend. Both 
he and fellow 
freshman 
Emyre 
Cole 

earned 
first-

team 
All-Big 

Ten accolades. 
Cole 
finished 

sixth 
in 
the 

all-around 
on 

Friday with an 

84.950 and qualified for Saturday’s 
individual finals on floor.

Senior 
Colin 
Mahar, 

meanwhile, qualified in the still 
rings with a score of 15.400, 
matching his career high for the 
third meet in a row. He went on 
to achieve another impressive 
15.000 
in 
the 
individual 

championships the next day.

Despite the team’s performance, 

Golder remains confident in his 
athletes. With plenty of young 
talent, the Wolverines have a lot 
of potential for upward mobility. 
Michigan will look to avenge its 
woes in two weeks at the NCAA 
Championships.

“I’m just 

going to try to 
restore their 
confidence.”
