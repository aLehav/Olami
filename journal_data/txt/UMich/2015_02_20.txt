Regents approve 
building projects, 
calendar changes

At the University’s Board 

of Regents meeting Thursday, 
several renovation projects and 
appointments were approved, 

including an updated plan for 
the Intramural Sports Build-
ing and the confirmation of a 
new University chief financial 
officer.

Renovations to athletic 

buildings

The regents approved a bud-

get increase for the renova-
tion of the Intramural Sports 
Building. The budget for the 
project has now been extended 
from $18.7 million to $21.4 mil-
lion. The additional funds will 

be used in part to build more 
group exercise rooms, add 
perimeter drains and install air 
conditioning.

The additional funding will 

be provided by investment pro-
ceeds and the Student Life Stu-
dent Fee for Facility Renewal.

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life, who 
included mention of the reno-
vations in her report to the 
regents, said preserving the 
building is important. At the 

time it was constructed in 1928, 
the facility was the first colle-
giate intramural sports build-
ing in the country.

“The project will preserve 

the history of the 87-year-old 
iconic facility,” Royster said. 
“It will also promote the health 
and wellness of our students, 
faculty and staff.”

The Muslim Student Asso-

ciation celebrated Black History 
Month Thursday night with a 
lecture on Islam’s roots in Africa.

The event, which was attend-

ed by about 50 people, was held 
in the Henderson Room of the 
Michigan League and features 
Associate History Prof. Rudolph 
Ware.

In his lecture, Ware outlined 

the history of Islam in Africa. 

He said that even before the offi-
cial beginning of Islam, when 
Muhammad 
traveled 
from 

Mecca to Medina on an invita-
tion to escape persecution, the 
religion has had a presence on 
the continent.

In the year 615 CE and again 

in 616 CE, Ware said Muslims 
escaped persecution by cross-
ing the Red Sea into present 
day Ethiopia and seeking refuge 
with a Christian king. However, 
over time, he said Blacks practic-
ing the religion have been alien-
ated by current Middle Eastern 
countries, leading to the earlier 
prominence of Islam in Western 
Africa often being forgotten.

Nonetheless, one sixth of the 

world’s Muslim population cur-
rently resides in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, Ware said. In Senegal, 
he said 98 percent of citizens are 

Muslim.

“The only Arab countries that 

have that percentage are Saudi 
Arabia and Yemen,” Ware said. 
“There are more Muslims in 
Nigeria than there are in Egypt, 
and Nigeria’s only 50 percent 
Muslim. There’s more Muslims 
in Ethiopia than there are in 
Iraq.”

This number is so high 

because of the tradition of 
Qur’an schools in western Afri-
ca, he said. Dating back to the 
1400s Qur’an schools were open 
to teach Muslim children math-
ematics and reading.

These schools, which still 

exist today, promoted the spread 
of Islam because certain groups 
of scholars were trained to mem-
orize the Qu’uran to the point of 
being able to reproduce it, Ware 

Six fraternities, 

sororities suspended 

for vandalism 
undergo review

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

After six University Greek 

life chapters drew criticism last 
month for causing extensive 
damage to two Northern Michi-
gan ski resorts, discussion about 
the incidents surfaced at Thurs-
day’s meeting of the University’s 
Board of Regents.

At the meeting, Interfrater-

nity Council President Alex 
Krupiak, an LSA senior, and 
Panhellenic Association Presi-
dent Maddy Walsh, a Business 
junior, 
issued 
apologies 
on 

behalf of the Greek commu-
nity and said Greek life judicial 
proceedings have already rec-
ommended sanctions for those 
involved.

“We have been collectively 

embarrassed and humbled by 
the actions of some of our mem-
bers,” Krupiak said. “We fully 
understand how our actions 
impacted everyone involved… 

and that severe measures need 
to be taken.”

Krupiak added that students 

have already faced the Student 
Organization Advancement and 
Recognition’s judicial process. 
The system referred cases to 
the chapters’ respective stu-
dent governing body, the Greek 
Activities Review Panel.

GARP is the judicial branch 

for 
the 
University’s 
Greek 

Councils — the Panhellenic 
Association, the Interfraternity 
Council, the National Pan-Hel-
lenic Council and the Multicul-
tural Greek Council.

Hearings 
are 
currently 

underway and Krupiak said 
GARP has recommended sanc-
tions, which are currently under 
review by Dean of Students 
Laura Blake Jones.

“The only way to move for-

ward completely from this is 
to ensure that every member 
understands the consequences 
of his or her behavior,” Krupiak 
said.

“We also recognize that, 

regardless of if an individual 
caused damage or not, each 
member had a responsibility 
to be an active bystander,” he 
added. “Failing to do so caused

meeting in A2

Members of the University’s 

Board of Regents convened in 
the Michigan Union on Thurs-
day afternoon for their month-
ly public meeting. In January, 
the regents also met in Ann 
Arbor, but in place of an open 
meeting, they gathered for 
closed strategy sessions.

In a January interview with 

The Michigan Daily, Univer-
sity President Mark Schlis-
sel said the retreat focused 
on philosophical discussions 
around what it means to be 
an excellent university and 
to brainstorm ways in which 
the University can continue to 
improve. He said the regents 
continue to bring an important 
perspective to the University’s 
policy-making process.

“The regents are incredibly 

engaged in the governance 
of the University,” he said. 
“They’re really the connection 
between professional academ-
ics like me and this huge public 
that we serve.”

In an e-mail interview after 

the strategic session, Regent 
Katherine 
White 
(D–Ann 

Arbor) noted that no official 

decisions were made at these 
meetings, but said the session 
gave the board a chance to 
focus on broad topics related 
to higher education.

“The retreat contrasts with 

our monthly meetings, which 
are focused on the topics that 
need 
immediate 
attention,” 

White said. “Our strategic ses-
sion was a good opportunity to 
focus on the future of higher 
education. It also gave us a 
chance to welcome new regent 
Michael Behm and get to know 
him better.”

Apart 
from 
White, 
no 

other regents were available 
for comment for this article. 
Five regents did not respond 
to e-mail inquires from the 
Daily. Regents Denise Ilitch 
(D–Bingham Farms) and Larry 
Deitch 
(D–Grosse 
Pointe) 

declined interview requests 
due to scheduling conflicts.

White said the closed strate-

gic session provides the board 
a chance to speak openly about 
how to improve the University, 
an opportunity not afforded at 
the monthly meetings.

“Again, this is our one 

chance a year to turn our atten-
tion to asking ‘What if?’ types 
of questions and to step away 
from the topics that demand 
our attention on a monthly 
basis,” White said. “It is good 
governance to have an oppor-
tunity to do a little blue-sky 
thinking and have very candid 
discussions.

Students weigh 

possible addition to 
Student Rights and 

Responsibilities

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

The Central Student Govern-

ment’s Student Honor Code Task 
Force held a forum Thursday 
night to gather student input for 
a new University-wide student 
honor code.

CSG President Bobby Dishell, 

a Public Policy senior, estab-
lished the task force earlier this 
month to compose a code per-
taining to academic integrity, 
individual behavior and student 
rights. The goal of creating a 
code is to complement the pre-
existing Statement of Student 
Rights and Responsibilities, a 
University document that out-
lines appropriate responses to 
inappropriate student behavior.

The forum was open to stu-

dents 
across 
campus. 
Aside 

from CSG members, 10 students 
attended the event.

CSG Vice President Emily 

Lustig, an LSA senior and the 
task force chair, led the forum.

According to Lustig, some 

student leaders opposed the 
Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities when it was first 
approved and said the honor 
code would give students a space

Speaker discusses race, identity 
in second community dinner

ZACH MOORE/Daily

Professor Frieda Ekotto speaks on philosophical considerations of race and identity at the Middle East and Arab 
Network community dinner at North Quad on Thursday. 

By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR

Online Editor

Editor’s Note: The Michigan 

Daily is piloting a new addition to 
our paper that will focus on living 
well on campus. 

Whether you’re a first year 

student living in the dorms or an 
upperclassman with a meal plan, 
navigating the dining halls can 
be daunting at times. There’s so 
much food, some of it may be unfa-
miliar-looking, and there’s no one 

to stop you from eating just cook-
ies for dinner. Sound familiar? 

Many students swipe into the 

dining hall with good intentions, 
and they know eating health-
ily is a vital component of fueling 
their minds and bodies and being 
a responsible quasi-adult. The 
hard part seems to be maximizing 
resources and planning ahead in an 
environment with so many choices. 

Since 2012, a lot has changed 

with University Housing’s dining. 
The newly renovated South Quad 

and East Quad dining halls offer 
a new ambiance and increased 
options, while the elimination of 
trays and single-serving sizes of 
meals bring more portion control 
into daily eating.

As I sat down with Director of 

Dining Steve Mangan and Lind-
say Haas, culinary and nutrition 
support specialist at the Univer-
sity, I discovered ways in which 
students living on and off campus 
could using campus dining halls 
as a means — rather than a barrier 
— to healthy decision-making. 

The FDA-recommended 2,000 

calories can add up quickly when 
there’s an endless amount of 
pizza, French fries and ice cream 
in front of you every day and your 
mom and dad aren’t around to 
make you eat your veggies. On the 
other hand, hitting the suggested 
daily consumption volumes for 
vitamins and proteins can be 
challenging. MyNutrition, in some 
ways, is a solution.

MyNutrition, 
an 
interactive 

online food search tool hostedon 
the University Housing website, 
gives students the ability to search 
and select their meals before going 
to the dining hall. By adding filters 
for nutrition, dietary preferences or 
allergens, it’s easy to pick out a sub-
set of healthy foods from the array 
of culinary options offered in each 
of the University’s dining facilities. 

Mangan suggested that stu-

dents also use MyPlate as a guide 
to ensure they’re eating a healthy, 
balanced diet. MyPlate, a nutri-
tional guide instituted by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
replaced the popular pyramid 
structure for food intake in 2011.

MyPlate, as the name sug-

gests, splits a meal off into nutri-
tional categories by sectioning a 
standard plate. The tool suggests 
eating approximately 30 percent 
grains, 40 percent vegetables, 10 
percent fruits and 20 percent pro-
tein. A smaller circle off to the side 
represents dairy intake, according 
to PRWeb.com.

Middle East and 
Arab Network 
seeks to provide 

space for discussion

By COLLEEN HARRISON

For the Daily

The Middle East and Arab 

Network hosted a community 
dinner Thursday evening, pro-
viding students who identify as 
Arab-American or Arab with 
an opportunity discuss their 
identities and explore their 
own narratives.

MEdAN hosted Prof. Frieda 

Ekotto, chair of the Depart-
ment of Afroamerican and 
African Studies, who discussed 
the work of 20th century phi-
losopher Frantz Fanon. She 
explored philosophical consid-
erations surrounding his work, 
particularly those involving 
race and identity.

“Questions of identity today 

are so problematic when peo-
ple don’t have places to be,” 
Ekotto said.

Fanon, known for his work 

studying the impacts of decol-

onization, was a vocal sup-
porter of the Algerian War of 
Independence, which spanned 
from 1954 to 1962 and resulted 
in Algeria’s liberation from 
France. Many historians say 
Fanon’s work played an major 
role in influencing political 
and social movements across 
the world.

The idea for hosting a key-

note speaker and community 
dinner originated during a 
meeting of the MEdAN execu-
tive board. Nearly 60 students 
attended Thursday’s talk.

Law student Emad Ansari 

said he attended the communi-
ty dinner to hear Ekotto speak 
on these topics.

“I think her biggest contri-

bution here is to encourage stu-
dents to think across historical 
contexts, and to follow ideas of 
identity and violence and apply 
them to the current time and 
to try and make sense of why 
violence occurs and how to 
respond to it with a peaceful 
solution,” Ansari said.

As members of MEdAN 

began looking for speakers for 
their second community din-
ner, the group focused on the 
theme of exploring the narra-

tives of individuals or commu-
nities of people. Ekotto came to 
mind when the group realized 
they also wanted to discuss the 
topic through the lens of the 
Middle East and North Africa.

LSA sophomore Mekarem 

Eljamal, 
MEdAN 
logistics 

chair, said the idea of reclaim-
ing one’s narrative was espe-
cially interesting.

“She has done work in Alge-

ria, in Tunisia, she’s given lec-
tures, and she’s done really 
interesting work on topics that 
MEdAN wants to focus on, so 
we just reached out to her and 
she came up with the idea of 
Franz Fanon in Algeria and the 
Algerian Revolution,” Eljamal 
said.

Though the group holds bi-

weekly discussions on iden-
tity, MEdAN hopes to host 
more events and dinners in the 
future.

LSA junior Haya Alfarhan, 

MEdAN outreach chair, said 
the group’s regular discussion 
sessions, called Chai Circles, 
present an opportunity to fos-
ter an active community on 
campus.

“What the Chai Circles do is

let us have conversations about 
important issues in informal set-
tings,” Alfarhan said.

For Eljamal, the Chai Circles 

and community dinners through 
MEdAN have given her the 
chance to explore shared identi-
ties.

“The spaces the MEdAN 

has created have enabled me to 
self-reflect and reclaim my nar-
rative, and these opportunities 
to reclaim my narrative are so 
empowering, in a way that is very 
hard to put into words,” Eljamal 
said.

For Ekotto, similar conversa-

tions emerge from Fanon’s work. 
Ekotto took questions from stu-
dents as they further discussed 
race, oppression, identity and 
colonialism. With each question, 
Ekotto noted how many of these 
considerations come up before in 
Fanon’s work.

“I 
realized 
it’s 
extremely 

important that if we’re talk-
ing about questions of identity, 
because this group they’re inter-
ested in reclaiming their identity, 
I think it’s important that they 
understand the bases — how you 
get to even understand who you 
are,” Ekotto said.

to provide input on a new policy.

“We really want this to be stu-

dent-focused and based on stu-
dent input,” Lustig said.

The code’s tentative language 

was presented at the forum and 
most attendees’ comments were 
centered around the possibil-
ity that the document’s language 
could infringe on students’ free-
dom of speech. Many were con-
cerned that the honor code gave 
the University too much power.

“As a member of the University 

of Michigan community, I will 
honor the institution with hon-
esty and integrity,” the proposed 
honor code states.

The code continues by asking 

students to pledge to promote 
inclusivity and respect, uphold 
the University’s reputation and 
refrain from cheating, stealing 
and plagiarism.

“I understand that if I fail to 

act in accordance with the afore-
mentioned principles then I will 
face appropriate consequences to 
be determined by my peers and 
faculty members,” the code con-
cludes.

Several attendees thought the 

overall language of the code was 
broad and vague.

Students also suggested the 

document define the code’s geo-
graphic parameters. Attendees 
asked if the code would apply to 
students while they were outside 
of Ann Arbor or Michigan.

The desire to create an honor 

code was propelled, in part, by 
incidents in Northern Michigan 
where six University Greek life 
chapters caused extensive dam-
age at two ski resorts.

Some students wanted to know 

if a student would always be con-
sidered as representing the Uni-
versity, or if their actions were 
only considered a reflection of the 
University in specific situations.

Despite his concerns, LSA 

freshman 
Grant 
Strobl 
was 

pleased CSG hosted the forum.

“I’m happy to see that the stu-

dent government wants to listen 
to the students,” Strobl said. “I 
think the honor code is great. I 
just want to make sure that it is 
respecting student rights to speak 
freely and engage in academic 
and controversial topics on cam-
pus because that is what the Uni-
versity of Michigan is all about.”

Law student Amanda Urban, 

associate chief justice of Central 
Student Judiciary, also found the 
forum helpful.

“I think this code gives us a 

really great opportunity to move 
forward in being able create 
something that is student-driven 
with students holding each other 
accountable instead of a closed 
process where administrators are 
making all the decisions with-
out students,” Urban said. “That 
being said, we have to be very 
careful of the language of the 
code and making sure that it’s 
fair.”

The task force will host anoth-

er forum on Feb. 25 on North 
Campus in the Pierpont Boule-
vard Room.

Adviser, said during public 
commentary he believes the 
renovation will be a worth-
while investment. Building a 
Better Michigan is a student 
advisory group for the Univer-
sity’s unions and recreation 
buildings.

“I invest time and energy 

into these projects so that my 
first-year residents, students 
that I give campus tours to, 
my younger brother and future 
generations of Michigan stu-
dents have access to quality 
exercise facilities,” he said. “We 
renovate in the hopes of giving 
the IM building the opportuni-
ty to be self-sufficient in years 
to come.”

Harper said the project’s 

planning has involved feedback 
from approximately 2,000 stu-
dents, faculty and staff mem-
bers.

The 
original 
renovation 

plans included new racquet-
ball courts, locker rooms, and 
group fitness and weightlifting 
rooms. Updates to plumbing, 
staff office rooms, wireless net-
working and wiring, exterior 
window replacement, mason-
ry repairs, as well as lighting 
improvements and a gym floor 
replacement are also planned.

The renovation is scheduled 

for completion in fall 2016.

The board also approved 

the demolition of a South State 
building formerly owned by 
publishing company Edwards 
Brothers Malloy. The demoli-
tion is intended to create addi-
tional land for the construction 
of a $168 million athletic com-
plex approved by the regents 
in September. The $2.4 million 
price tag is included in the proj-
ects total $168 million budget.

The additional land will both 

provide for future stormwater 
management and reduce wet-
land impact during the com-
plex’s construction.

The demolition process for 

the building, which was vacated 
in December 2014, is slated to 
begin in April 2015, and will be 
completed by Summer 2015.

Academic calendar 

revisions

The regents discussed an 

action request submitted by 
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack suggesting changes to the 
winter 2016 academic calendar 
to accommodate the Jewish hol-
iday of Passover as well as Greek 
Orthodox Easter.

This 
conversation 
also 

expanded to discuss recent out-
cry from students regarding 
the fall 2015 academic calen-
dar, which currently has exams 
scheduled to end Dec. 23.

These dates would effectively 

shorten winter break by four 
days compared to this year’s 

break, and could force out-of-
state students to travel home on 
Christmas Eve.

More than 5,000 students 

have signed a petition created 
Monday to change the fall 2015 
dates. The petition was origi-
nally circulated by members of 
a classroom group project titled 
“Crush the Calendar.” Several 
members of the group attended 
the meeting.

Kinesiology sophomore Wil-

liam McPherson spoke to the 
regents during public commen-
tary on behalf of the group.

He said the late exam sched-

ule would hurt many students 
due to the high cost of airline 
prices and overcrowded air-
ports on days near Christmas 
Day, as well as cause interna-
tional and out-of-state students 
to potentially miss Christmas 
due to extended travel time.

“We believe that any exams 

on such a late day will have neg-
ative repercussions on students, 
faculty and families,” McPher-
son said.

The 
group 
has 
proposed 

changing the calendar to either 
shorten or eliminate the Fall 
Study Break in October, or begin 
classes before Labor Day.

“We would appreciate the 

opportunity to work alongside 
with the Board of Regents in an 
effort to find an academic cal-
endar that works both for the 
administration and the student 
body,” he said.

In response, Pollack said 

beginning classes before Labor 
Day wasn’t feasible.

“Beginning 
classes 
before 

Labor Day simply won’t work, 
especially this year, for a num-
ber of reasons,” she said. “I 
think it is important to under-
stand that the reason the last 
day of finals is so late this year 
is because Labor Day moved ear-
lier and earlier and earlier, and 
this year it was September 1st 
and next year it falls on Septem-
ber 7th.”

However, she said the regents 

would 
consider 
shortening 

or eliminating Fall Break if a 
majority of students agreed.

“I am completely willing, 

and I think the board would be 
completely supportive, if the 
student body as a whole wanted 
to eliminate the study break,” 
Pollack said. “But we do need to 
get a sense, not just from a small 
group of students, but from a 
large group of students.”

Fall Break was originally pro-

posed in 2001 by the Michigan 
Student Assembly, now CSG, 
and approved unanimously by 
the Board of Regents.

Pollack said she would meet 

with 
CSG 
President 
Bobby 

Dishell, a Public Policy senior, to 
discuss the issue further.

New appointment 

approvals

The regents approved several 

new appointments and reap-

pointments at the meeting.

Kevin Hegarty, current vice 

president and chief financial 
officer at the University of Texas 
at Austin, was approved as the 
University’s chief financial offi-
cer and executive vice president.

University President Mark 

Schlissel 
announced 
Mon-

day that he would recommend 
Hegarty, who held his position 
at UTA for 14 years. In April, 
he will take over for Douglas 
Strong, interim executive vice 
president and chief financial 
officer.

The previous executive vice 

president and chief financial 
officer, Tim Slottow, held the 
position for 12 years. He left 
his post last year to assume the 
presidency at the University of 
Phoenix.

During his tenure, Slottow 

worked closely with Univer-
sity President Emerita Mary 
Sue Coleman to initiate several 
cost saving programs, includ-
ing a strategic sourcing program 
designed to cut costs by buying 
supplies in bulk. He also helped 
launch the Administrative Ser-
vices 
Transformation 
initia-

tive, a controversial program 
designed to increase efficiency 
by consolidating department-
level employees in a shared ser-
vices center.

A certified public accountant, 

Hegarty was formerly the vice 
president and chief financial 
officer of Dell Financial Servic-
es LP. He serves on the boards of 
NewComLink and the Greater 
Austin Chamber of Commerce.

Hegarty said the opportunity 

arrived at the right time for him, 
as other UTA administrators 
were also rethinking their posi-
tions.

“It’s one of the number one 

publics,” Hegarty said in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “When we compare our-
selves at the University of Texas 
to other great public universi-
ties... the University of Michi-
gan is always near the top, so it’s 
a great opportunity.”

In an e-mail to faculty and 

staff Monday, Schlissel thanked 
Strong for his service to the Uni-
versity as CFO and welcomed 
Hegarty.

“My recommendation of Mr. 

Hegarty follows a successful 
and competitive search pro-
cess,” he wrote. “I thank the 
members of the search commit-
tee for their thorough efforts 
leading to this outstanding rec-
ommendation.”

The regents also approved 

Pollack’s recommendation for 
a new dean of the Horace H. 
Rackham School of Graduate 
Studies.

Chemistry Prof. Carol Fier-

ke, chair of the department, 
will take over for Dean Janet A. 
Weiss.

Fierke 
is 
a 
postdoctoral 

graduate 
from 
Pennsylvania 

State University. She has pub-
lished 217 research articles and 
reviews and received grants 
from foundations including the 
National Science Foundation 
and the American Cancer Soci-
ety.

In her time at the University, 

Fierke has received the Distin-
guished Faculty Achievement 
Award and the Jerome and Isa-
bella Karle Distinguished Uni-
versity Professor of Chemistry 
title, among other accolades.

Weiss has held the post since 

2005.

“I’m honored to serve the 

University of Michigan in this 
important 
leadership 
role,” 

Fierke said in a University 
news release. “I look forward 
to working with my new col-
leagues to further enhance the 
experience of graduate study 
for students and faculty.”

The regents also reappoint-

ed Daniel Little to his post as 
chancellor of the University’s 
Dearborn campus through June 
2018. Little has held the posi-
tion since 2000.

CSG president talks new 

projects

CSG President Bobby Dishell 

addressed spoke on a number of 
issues involving CSG, including 
student safety and a proposed 
honor code, as well as a propos-
al to pay the CSG president.

Dishell said he appreciated 

University Parking and Trans-
portation Services’ additional 
funding to the Night Owl bus 
route, a service created by CSG 
that runs late at night to help 
transport students living off 
campus home safely. The route 
was initially slated to end this 
semester, but the funding from 
PTS has allowed it to continue.

According to Dishell, the 

route transported 13,000 peo-
ple in the last year.

At the end of his address, 

Dishell voiced concerns with 
the potential for some students 
to be excluded from running for 
CSG executive positions based 
on socio-economic status.

He said both he and his vice 

president work 30 to 50 hours 
per week, meaning that for stu-
dents who need to devote time 
to work-study or off-campus 
jobs, the position would be 
impossible to do.

Dishell asked the board to 

consider creating some form of 
reimbursement for CSG execu-
tives to allow more students to 
take on student leadership.

“The current job structure 

eliminates many students that 
could potentially do an infi-
nitely better job than I or my 
predecessors,” 
Dishell 
said. 

“Unfortunately, 
this 
means 

that students of privilege will 
likely hold these roles until we 
do something to fix this. And 
to me, that is not right, just or 
fair.”

said.

For hundreds of years, the cler-

ics who taught Islam were protect-
ed through an agreement with the 
country’s rulers. However, when 
the Atlantic slave trade took off in 
the region, African kings began 
selling Muslim peasants despite a 
long history against enslavement of 
Muslims, Ware said. This led to the 
spread of Islam to America, Ware 
said.

“When those people are cap-

tured and sold as slaves and they’re 
taken away on European slave 
ships, and they’re dropped in plac-
es, they can reconstitute partial or 
entire copies of the Qur’an because 
they are the Qur’an,” Ware said.

Though some historians believe 

Muslims were unable to pass 
their religion onto their children 
because of this history, Ware said 
he disagreed. He cited several 
instances where Islam was preva-
lent in enslaved America, namely 
a case where slaves kept records in 
Arabic because their masters could 
not write. Other evidence include a 
1920 interview with a woman who 
was freed during the Civil War 
remembered other slaves practic-
ing Islam and a 1860 Louisiana 
census which acknowledged Black 
Muslims.

Ware noted many traditional 

Black superstitions in the United 
States come from Islamic roots, 
which he said additionally proved 
African Muslims were also a part 
of the slave trade.

A common superstition in the 

American South is that if some-
one sweeps a broom over one’s 
feet, in response the person whose 
feet have been swept spits on the 
broom, paralleling a common Mus-
lim practice.

“That’s the reason why for an 

African American convert (to 
Islam), it’s a reversion not a conver-
sion,” Ware said.

Engineering junior Jainabou 

Barry, who attended the event, 
grew up both in Gambia and the 
United States. She said through her 
experience, she was able to expe-
rience differences and parallels 
between the discussion of Islam in 
Africa and in the United States.

“There, my Qur’an school, was 

focused more on the spiritual,” 
Barry said. “Coming here, I saw 
the more political agenda being 
pushed.”

Ware said he saw America 

today as a unique opportunity for 
Muslims — one they have not had 
for seven or eight centuries. With 
freedom of religion in the United 
States, there are Muslims of all eth-
nic and racial background.

“The only way that you change 

the nature of the conversation is 
by changing the composition of the 
room,” Ware said. “If as relatively 
privileged upper middle class Mus-
lims we don’t reach out to the Afri-
can American Muslim community, 
to the African immigrant Muslim 
community, to the Bangladeshi 
Muslim community, if we don’t do 
that, then we can lament the fact 
that this conversation hasn’t start-
ed, but the truth is, we haven’t done 
our job to start it.”

HISTORY

major ramifications for their 
entire organizations and the Uni-
versity as a whole.”

A damaged reputation for 

the University has been a major 
complaint for University admin-
istrators. E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for student life, 
said in a January interview with 
The Michigan Daily that the 
“ski trip” vandalism marked a 
turning point in the University’s 
interaction with Greek life on 
campus.

“We can’t keep going this 

way,” she said. “Too much at risk. 
Too many safety issues. We can’t 
keep behaving like we have this 
system, and because there are so 
many good things about the sys-
tem, that makes the things that 
are unhealthy and dangerous 
about the system okay. And that’s 
what we’ve been doing. I think 
that Up North was a wakeup call 
for us as an institution and as a 
community.”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel added in a February 
interview with the Daily that the 
incident made him quite angry, 
and emphasized that measures 
were necessary beyond mak-
ing those responsible pay for the 
damages.

“Simply allowing restitution 

to be paid and thinking that 
that’s all that happens when 
you do something that actually 
seems criminal, that’s not right 
either,” he said. “So I do think 
that we need to use our existing 
procedures to figure out what 
happened, try to figure out who 
individually is responsible, and 
have an appropriate punishment 
that will really ask people to 
wake up and look at what they’ve 
done and consider very seriously 
their behavior in the future.”

Walsh said leaders from the 

Greek community plan to work 
together and with University 
administrators to shift the Greek 
life culture and prevent similar 
events from occurring again. 
She also noted the importance 
of pairing formal sanctions with 
other measures.

“While I cannot speak to the 

exact sanctions, I would expect 
that punitive measures would 
be the most effective if paired 
with restorative and educational 
efforts as well,” Walsh said.

Regent Denise Ilitch (D–Bing-

ham Farms) thanked Krupiak 
and Walsh for their comments 
and said she accepted their col-
lective apology. She noted that, 
as a University alum and former 
member of Greek life, she was 
happy to see students working to 
ameliorate unhealthy practices.

This is the third year the 

regents opted to replace their 
January public session with 
closed door meetings. In 2013, 
the regents traveled to Califor-
nia where they met with offi-
cials from Stanford University, 
the University of California and 
Google. Last year, the board 
gathered in New York City to 
hear from several higher educa-
tion officials, including the presi-
dent of Yale University.

This time, the regents chose to 

remain in Ann Arbor.

“This meeting is internally 

focused and we will neither be 
meeting with outside speakers 
nor traveling outside the state of 

Michigan,” Regent Kathy White 
(D–Ann Arbor) wrote in a Janu-
ary e-mail interview. “Instead, 
this session is to give the Board 
an opportunity to have long-
term strategic sessions with our 
new President, Dr. Mark Schlis-
sel.”

In a 2013 interview with The 

Ann Arbor News, University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said 
“a scheduling issue” prevented 
holding both that year’s Califor-
nia trip and the regularly sched-
uled January public meeting.

“It falls in the week when 

these people’s schedules were 
already set aside for a board of 
regents meeting,” he said in 2013. 
“They decided to take that time 
that was already in their sched-
ules and handle that differently.”

In 
subsequent 
years, 
the 

regents have continued to hold 
a January strategic session in 
place of a public meeting.

This year, Schlissel said the 

group discussed efforts to diver-
sify campus. He noted the Uni-
versity’s long-standing goal to 
diversify but said the current 
strategies must be improved.

“It really is fair to say that 

there has been a long-term com-
mitment to diversity at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, I think the 
record is really clear,” Schlissel 
said. “The problem is, our suc-
cess hasn’t matched our aspi-
rations despite peoples serious 
efforts and serious commit-
ments.”

On Monday, Schlissel held a 

leadership breakfast on diversity, 
where he gathered input from 
attendees and emphasized his 

administration’s 
commitment 

to inclusion and equity. He also 
mentioned the University’s ongo-
ing efforts to compose a campus-
wide diversity plan, a project 
which he said is slated for release 
in the spring.

“One (component) is work-

ing on undergraduate admission 
and recruitment,” he said. “So 
we have to reach out and find 
talented students in all different 
parts of our state and parts of our 
country without regard for their 
socioeconomic, 
racial, 
ethnic 

background.”

In addition to diversity, Schlis-

sel said discussions touched on 
possible improvements to the 
individual schools and colleg-
es and methods for increasing 
accessibility and affordability of 
higher education.

I

’m sure that many of you have read the 
recent column published in The Michi-
gan Daily titled, “Relative wealth.”

If you’ve read my previ-

ous columns, then you prob-
ably know how deeply I care 
about socioeconomic issues.

You might think I read 

the article and came away 
shocked and horrified by 
what was described as 
middle class. To an extent, I 
was. However, my eyes also 
glazed over the words.

The author clarifies that 

she’s “privileged” in a way 
that she can afford more 
than necessities; however, the way in which 
she describes her finances makes me feel 
like she believes she doesn’t benefit from 
the privilege of a high-SES status — much 
like many people do on this campus. When I 
read someone arguing they’re middle class 
because their $2 million house only has three 
bedrooms and two baths, I can’t help but feel 
frustrated. It’s the same type of complaint 
that I hear all the time on campus. Someone 
complains because they can’t afford another 
Ralph Lauren Polo, or they’re angry that their 
parents won’t pay for them to go on spring 
break this year.

Typically, I would overlook these com-

ments, but they’re problematic because they 
overshadow real financial problems experi-
enced by people on this campus. Real financial 
problems are not being able to pay your rent.

They’re canceling dinner plans because you 

don’t have the money in your bank account. 

They’re the twinge in your gut when your 
friends talk about past vacations because you 
know that your family could never afford one. 
Upper-class financial “problems,” perpetu-
ated by not just the author but many others 
on this campus as well create a climate where 
people with genuine financial difficulties 
hide their struggle. Who wants to blow away 
their friend group with their tale of poverty? 
I know I don’t.

According to the Office of Registrar, 

in 2011, 63 percent of incoming freshmen 
reported coming from families earning over 
$100,000, yet the median family income in 
the United States is slightly over $50,000. 
Earning over $100,000 constitutes a person 
as upper-middle class, so this is indicative of 
the fact that a majority of students on campus 
come from upper-middle class families.

Though this climate makes low-SES stories 

difficult to tell, this only makes them more 
important. Within these narratives lie stories 
of strife, heart, overcoming and oppression 
that deserve a platform. They create a way for 
people to empathize with genuine financial 
issues, and this empathy is the start to social 
change that this campus so obviously needs.

So, no matter how much I hate it, it’s time 

for my story, and then it’s time for yours.

Until college, I lived with a single parent 

and another relative. Both worked low-income 
restaurant jobs, and one ended up with medical 
conditions that left her unable to work. This 
equated to serious financial issues. I never 
owned a real winter coat until college. I looked 
up in the shower every day to see plastic 
covering the roof of our bathroom. I remember 
the day our auto company foreclosed on our car.

PAYTON LUOKKALA | VIEWPOINT

A poet factory

It is well known that Ann Arbor is 

popular for our world-renowned Uni-
versity, sports teams and traditions, 
our first-class medical facilities, an 
abundance of great restaurants, lib-
eral politics and our art. Is everyone 
fully aware of the ART? It is a rather 
ambiguous term, but what my focus 
is and what I have come to know Ann 
Arbor for is the poetry.

The city is basically a poet-grow-

ing factory. Although American clas-
sics like Robert Frost lived in Ann 
Arbor for only a short time, we share 
so many writers with the Detroit 
area, and we have so many others 
who visit our city. I am speaking of 
the poets that are growing here now 
— from seeds, the very beginning.

It is all relative to when you start, 

of course, so I consider myself a seed. 
I am 18 years old. There are so many 
events that are always happening, 
through the University and outside 
of it, to help develop young poets.

The University’s Zell Visiting 

Writers Series, in partnership with 
UMMA, hosts free events, inviting 
speakers (poets and other writers 
too) to both read and have Q&A 
sessions, allowing young writers-
to-be to pick the brains of those 
more experienced.

Beyond the teachers in the Eng-

lish department — who are great 

— there is the Lloyd Hall Scholars 
Program, a Michigan Learning 
Community focusing on writing 
and the arts, where the teachers are 
awesome in their own right. They 
help us learn not only in the class-
room, but in the world that is the 
Ann Arbor poetry scene. (Note to 
others and myself: Write details of 
the events down, because as much 
as I would like to hope, we will 
not remember them, and these are 
events you do not want to miss!)

Educators are a great way of 

tying together what is happening 
within the University and what’s 
occurring outside of it, because 
although we may like to think we 
are aware of both, we often don’t 
attend these events as much as 
we could.

Local bookstores frequently par-

ticipate in shaping young poets. Lite-
rati Bookstore often has writers read 
their work. (I know this may sound 
like a lot of listening, but there is so 
much to be learned from listening 
alone.) To see how your poems play 
against an audience, Crazy Wisdom 
Bookstore and Tea Room on Main 
Street hosts a poetry open mic every 
second and fourth Wednesday of 
the month from 7-9 p.m. Sweetwa-
ters Coffee & Tea on Washington 
presents the Skazat Poetry Series on 

the third Tuesday of each month, 
which includes an open mic to start 
the night, and ends with a featured 
regional reader (so it’s the best of 
both worlds).

An event that I have attended 

repeatedly is the Ann Arbor Poetry 
Slam (which happens at 8 p.m. every 
Sunday at Silvio’s Organic Pizza). 
There is a suggested $5 donation, but 
they are extremely understanding of 
us poor college kids, and I just give 
whatever change I have in my pock-
et at the time. The night starts with 
an open mic for those who want to 
share, but not compete. The compe-
tition, the main event, is next. Each 
time I have been there, it has consist-
ed of six or seven people performing. 
Some are more practiced than the 
others, some clearly beginners. It is 
apparent that it is a learning experi-
ence (I have not tried it yet, because I 
am a chicken), but it is also just plain 
fun: great pizza, snapping, clapping 
and appreciation fill the air.

Although you might learn tech-

nique or emotion elsewhere, an 
event like this one is where a poet 
learns to be confident. So come on 
down — maybe by then I will have 
convinced myself to participate.

SCHRAMM

F

rom 2007-2011, I was kind of 
a vegetarian. What I mean 
is that I wanted to be a full-

on 
vegetarian, 

but since I was a 
middle-schooler 
who 
couldn’t 

make these sort 
of 
life-changing 

decisions without 
consulting 
her 

parents (and if I’m 
being completely 
honest, because I 
had a deep passion 
for my omnivo-
rous lifestyle), I just didn’t eat red 
meat. My decision to become a non-
red meat eater was based on the fact 
that I thought animals were cute 
and the thought of eating dead pigs, 
cows, etc. — regardless of how deli-
cious they are — filled my 11-year-
old heart with terror.

I’m not sure what shocked my 

parents more: the fact that I even 
wanted to give up my diet of ribs 
and burgers and brisket (let me 
reiterate, I loved eating meat), or 
the fact that I kept up my red meat-
free diet for four years. What sur-
prised me the most was that once 
I got accustomed to this pattern, it 
was very easy to keep up. And even 
though I started eating red meat 

again in the summer of 2011, I defi-
nitely do not eat as much red meat 
as I did before 2007. The reason I 
started eating red meat again was 
not because I gave into temptation 
— honestly the burger I ate at camp 
was probably one of the worst burg-
ers I’ve ever had (and it wasn’t even 
a cheeseburger… the Jewish camp 
struggle). I ate that subpar burger 
because the image of a dead baby 
animal was no longer as graphic for 
me. My initial reason for taking up 
pseudo-vegetarianism felt far away 
and disconnected from my life as 
well as from the overcooked burg-
ers that all my friends were eating.

And yet, in the last couple weeks 

I’ve started thinking about veg-
etarianism again. And this time 
it’s about more than just some cute 
animals. After reading “The Omni-
vore’s Dilemma: A Natural History 
of Four Meals” by Michael Pollan 
and “Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food 
Giants Hooked Us” by Michael 
Moss, I learned that eating meat is 
doing more damage than just kill-
ing innocent animals (although 
this is a convincing argument on its 
own). While a double bacon cheese-
burger sounds wholesome and deli-
cious, in reality, the system that 
produces this delicacy goes against 
the natural food system, releases 

huge amounts of carbon dioxide 
and other emissions into our atmo-
sphere and destroys the ecosystems 
where grazing animals like cows 
are mass-produced and slaugh-
tered. If all that isn’t enough, this 
type of eating is killing us as well: 
clogging our arteries, causing dia-
betes and numerous other health 
problems that come from lack of 
regulation and sanitation. Okay, 
I’m done with my tirade for now, 
but if you’re interested in learning 
more about this broken system, I 
thoroughly recommend the afore-
mentioned books, which are full of 
information that is simultaneously 
interesting and horrifying.

Having said all that, I would be 

lying if I said I have taken up veg-
etarianism again — I’m still in the 
early stages of contemplating this 
life change and forgetting that I 
want to make this change and eat-
ing a ham-and-cheese sandwich. 
But I think I will do it, because 
while it is horrifying to think that 
eating meat can cause so many envi-
ronmental and health problems, it 
is kind of amazing what a positive 
impact cutting out or just eating less 
meat can have on the world.

My childhood was spent in a 

constant string of financial panic, 
as I hid behind the rail of our 
staircase to hear the next saga of 
financial ruin. My heart raced with 
anxiety that electrified my body 
in horrifying ways. I overthought, 
freaked out, cried. Poverty was the 
scorching-hot glue that held my 
childhood together. And it sucked.

There’s no silver lining in being 

of a lower socioeconomic status. 
It’s not some character-building 
wonder to those struck by it. It’s a 
terrifying roller-coaster ride.

That’s my condensed story, and 

like I said, it’s time for yours.

We 
can’t 
spend 
any 
more 

time bashing “Relative wealth.” 
That’s not an effective use of this 
notoriety. The reality is that many 
high-SES people are more ignorant 
than hateful or judgmental. We 
need to use this energy proactively 
to share the stories that need 

to be shared.

If you are lower SES, I implore 

you speak up the next time these 
conversations surface. If you’re in 
a group setting where this becomes 
a topic, don’t shy away from your 
story because it’s shameful at this 
University. Be bold. If people don’t 
speak up, upper-class perceptions 
of financial strife maintain their 
status as actual problems.

Additionally, 
if 
you 
believe 

your story needs to be shared in a 
setting bigger than a conversational 
context, I would highly encourage 
you to seek out a publication or 
speaking opportunity. From my 
experiences, writing a column has 
been crucial in helping me navigate 
my experiences with low-SES.

Oh, and one more thing. I hope 

— no, expect — that articles like 
this get just as many reads and 
shares as “Relative wealth.” If you 
complained about that article and 

give it more attention than ones like 
this, you are just as problematic as 
you believe the author’s viewpoint 
is. It shows that you’re willing 
to give more time, energy and 
attention to the problem than to 
the solution. It also shows that 
you’re willing to elevate stories of 
privilege over those of raw pain.

I don’t want this conversation to 

end with a hateful flicker into the 
wind. Let’s take this energy and turn 
it into an opportunity to educate 
and change our campus’ culture.

you hate.

n the past week, the Fall 2015 academic calendar has caused 
uproar within the University’s student body. A petition created 
by LSA freshman Lauren Siegel for her Organizational Studies 

class, Activism, calls for the University to change the exam schedule. 
As it stands, the last day for professors to give exams would be Dec. 
23, and classes are set to begin Jan. 6, allowing only one day for 
students with exams on Dec. 23 to travel home for Christmas Eve, 
and shortening an already short break. As of 12:22 a.m. on Friday, the 
petition has 5,443 signatures. While it is not feasible for the Fall 2015 
calendar to change with such short notice, the late exam schedule 
is expected to recur every time Labor Day falls in the second week 
of September. Therefore, the University must reconsider the fall 
schedule in future years to begin prior to Labor day resulting in 
final exams ending earlier.

According to University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald, classes traditionally start after 
Labor Day due to previous faculty and student 
preference. In 2002, students requested the 
fall break, pushing the exam schedule later. 
Both of these factors have led to a later end 
of the semester. This issue arose in 2004 and 
2010, and is expected to arise again in 2020 
as the result of a 2013 action request written 
by University Provost Martha Pollack. The 
request reads, “There are no conflicts with 
religious holidays contained in this calendar.”

However, while exams may not end on 

Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, there are 
conflicts in this calendar. Ending exams 
on the Dec. 23 prevents many students, 
professors and GSIs from making it home in 
time to celebrate the holidays and potentially 
conflicts with religious obligations. The 
late exam dates add stress and difficulties 
for travel plans. December is often a time 
of heavy snowstorms and weather-related 
delays. If airline delays occur, or roads are 
unsafe for travel, members of the University 
community may not be able to get home safely 
and in time for Christmas Eve.

Additionally, faculty are required to 

complete all grades 72 hours after the final 
exam is given. Therefore, if a final is given on 
Dec. 23 and the faculty wants to avoid grading 
on the holiday, there is effectively less than 
24 hours to complete grading. Public Policy 
Prof. Paul Courant, who was Provost of the 
University from 2002 to 2005, agreed, saying, 
“For many of my colleagues it’s really hard. 
Not only is it that they have three days but 
you know one of those days is Christmas Eve 
and one of those days is Christmas and that 
matters to a lot of people.” Put simply, the 
University should be more understanding 
of this concern as it directly conflicts with 
academics and faculty well-being.

Despite the University being a non-

religious 
institution, 
University 
Provost 

Martha Pollack wrote in an action request, 
“…we have made it a practice to make every 
reasonable effort to help students avoid 
negative 
academic 
consequences 
when 

their religious obligations conflict with 
academic requirements.” In this situation, 
this is clearly not the case. Due to strict exam 
policy, students will not receive flexibility 
from their professors to take the exam on a 
different date unless approved by the Final 
Examination Committee. In cases when the 
exam schedule does end as late as Dec. 23, the 
University should relax this exam policy to 
accommodate student travel within two days 
of Christmas Eve.

There are also glaring inconsistencies in 

University scheduling decisions. Pollack’s 
action request for change of the winter term 
proposed that classes end April 18 instead of 
April 20 to avoid overlapping with Passover. 
Therefore, it is questionable as to why the 
University wouldn’t recognize the same 
concern with ending exams close to Christmas.

A change in the academic calendar with 

such short notice would affect programs that 
are already planned, such as new student 
orientation, and therefore should not be 
changed for the coming fall. At Thursday’s 
meeting, the Board of Regents acknowledged 
the options to amending the calendar are 
shortening fall break or starting classes earlier 
in the year. Since fall break gives a much-
needed respite to students and was highly 
demanded in 2002 by the student population, 
it should not be eliminated. Therefore, the 
University should consider starting classes 
a week earlier, before Labor Day. While 
there would certainly be opposition to this 
proposal, it is the best solution to fixing this 
problem. 
Scheduling 
around 
Christmas 

should be of higher priority than beginning 
school after Labor Day.

Nostalgia abounds at 
Chaplin retrospective

By GRACE HAMILTON 

Daily Arts Writer

The rows of The Michigan 

Theater are filled with heads; 
bald heads, wrinkled ones, grey 
ones, coupled ones and many 
invisible ones that do not reach 
the top of the seat. The great big 
golden room is filled with the soft 
conversation and laughter that 
usually precedes highly anticipat-
ed operas and blockbuster films. 
To my left is a pair that looks to 
be in their ’80s and to my right a 
young girl and her parents. There 
are also some of that academic 
looking species sprinkled around 
the aisles, conversing with one 
another.

The gentleman responsible for 

our gathering, in case the descrip-
tion didn’t give it away, is Charlie 
Chaplin. On February 8, four of 
his short films were screened 
at the Michigan Theater as part 
of the theater’s Family-Friend-
ly Film series, with live organ 
accompaniment from Andrew 
Rogers on the theater’s 1927 Bar-
ton organ. The films included 
“The Floorwalker,” “The Immi-
grant,” “The Masquerader” and 
“The Rink,” all made between 
1914 and 1917 as part of Chaplin’s 
contract with Lone Star-Mutual 
(a division of the Mutual Film 
Corporation created solely for 
the purpose of making Chaplin’s 
films). The theater will continue 
to pay homage to Chaplin every 
Monday until April 25th by show-
ing newly restored prints.

Over the course of his career, 

Chaplin starred in over 80 films, 
65 of which premiered during 
the years of 1914 and 1915. He 
rose almost instantly to super-
stardom, mainly through the 
popularity 
of 
his 
on-screen 

persona, 
The 
Tramp, 
who 

appears in these short films as 
well. “The Tramp” is a playful 
and mischievous character with a 
big heart, who often finds himself 
in trouble by trying to disguise 
his lower social status. Chaplin 
spends the last 10 minutes of “The 
Immigrant” scheming to find a 
coin to pay the daunting waiter at 
a small French café with his love 
interest beside him.

Chaplin’s 
childhood 
was 

defined by poverty and hardship. 
His father passed away, and his 
mother struggled with mental ill-
ness. By age 14, Chaplin had left 
school and turned his focus to 

acting. By the time of his work 
with Mutual, he was the highest 
paid movie star in the world and 
praised for his artistry.

His career was filled with 

many controversies, mostly sur-
rounding his strong and often 
vocalized anti-capitalist beliefs. 
After leaving the U.S. for London 
in 1952, he was denied re-entry to 
the country, returning again for 
the first time in 1972 to accept an 
award.

On this Sunday, the theater 

roared with laughter at Chaplin’s 
antics, like the running staircase 
in “The Floorwalker.” The chil-
dren giggled, the old man shook 
in his seat and the bald man in 
front of me threw his head back 
in amusement.

“So, what is it that makes 

someone an icon?” I wondered, 
awed by the ability of a silent film 
from a past era to draw such plea-
sure from this odd crowd.

Clearly, it’s more than just tal-

ent or an interesting look that 
makes someone stick. “Creative 
genius” is a weird phrase that 
people use without really know-
ing what they mean to say, except 
that they know when they see it. I 
use it here in this style.

Chaplin wrote, directed, pro-

duced and starred in nearly all of 
his films. His genius is magnified 
by the lack of speech in his work. 
The audience must rely on move-
ment, gestures and grainy faces 
to understand the story. Chaplin 
silently directs the action of the 
characters around him, the force 
of gravity that keeps the narra-
tive firmly grounded.

Music adds grandeur to the 

films. Rogers sewed transitions 
between the four with the famil-
iar tune of Chaplin’s “Smile,” 
composed in 1936 for his film 
“Modern Times.”

The melodies help provide 

cues to direct the responses of 
the audience — sadness, shock, 
laughter, suspense. The experi-
ence is quite unlike anything 
today.

In a way, the magnificent prog-

ress of film in the last century has 
detracted from its purity as an 
art form; it has become some-
thing else all together. Special 
effects and CGI amaze, yet often 
distract. That’s not a bad thing; 
it’s just different. Returning to 
Chaplin’s work, almost 100 years 
old now, I feel as if I am viewing 
film with fresh eyes.

Chaplin created comedy that 

was dually a form of meaning-
ful social commentary, a deli-
cate balance that is not often 
achieved in the genre today 
with quite the same grace. On 
top of that, his films leave room 
for sadness and sympathy.

I’m relieved to avoid some 

kind of confession that silent 
film is after all, very boring; 
every opportunity to disprove 
criticisms of generation Y’s 
cultural apathy is a lucky one. 
Chaplin’s films are gems at the 
core of a medium that has come 
to dominate modern culture.

Whether it’s this important 

aspect that draws you in, the 
simple promise of a good laugh, 
the organ or even just an inter-
est in the time period itself, 
Chaplin deserves your trip out 
of bed and a standing ovation.

EVENT REVIEW
TV COLUMN

‘Shameless’: the show 

you need to watch
S

poiler Alert: This column 
contains spoilers from the 
fourth and fifth seasons of 

Showtime’s “Shameless.”

There’s a running joke among 

some 
of 
my 

friends 
that 

I’m constantly 
raving 
about 

shows nobody 
watches or has 
even heard of. 
It’s frustrating. 
“Bates Motel” 
really is great. 
DirecTV’s 
“Kingdom” — 
yes, 
the 
one 

with Nick Jonas — was the biggest 
surprise of 2014. And don’t get me 
started on “Hannibal.” My recent 
Anthony Hopkins trilogy binge 
reaffirmed just how inventive and 
spectacular NBC’s imagining of 
the character really is. But of all 
the shows that are so aggravat-
ingly underappreciated, Showtime 
has managed to put three of the 
best together all on the same night.

I can say with confidence: 

Showtime’s current Sunday night 
lineup — “Shameless,” “House 
of Lies” and “Episodes” — is the 
best night of television you aren’t 
watching.

“Shameless” has flown under 

the radar since its debut in Janu-
ary 2011, despite being an increas-
ingly steady performer for the 
network. Though even as it’s 
amassed consistent acclaim and a 
loyal audience, “Shameless” lacks 
one critical ingredient: buzz.

“Game of Thrones” has buzz. 

“Homeland” has buzz. Hell, even 
“The Affair” has some. No matter 
how many people actually watch 
it, it’s talked about. Blogs recap it. 
It trends on Twitter. People argue 
that it was snubbed. That special X 
factor. But like “The Americans” 
or the aforementioned “Bates 
Motel” and “Kingdom” — all wor-
thy series — “Shameless” is still 
struggling for everyone’s attention 
in an immensely crowded mar-
ketplace. And just as “House of 
Lies” and “Episodes” do on Sunday 
nights, the comedies have followed 
“Shameless” ’s quiet lead.

“House of Lies,” the Don Chea-

dle-led series, has been a consis-
tent comedy force for four seasons. 
Along with Cheadle and Kristen 
Bell, his business partner and on-
again-off-again love interest, Ben 
Schwartz and Josh Lawson round 
out one of the strongest half-hour 
ensembles on television. In its 
current season, more so than ever 
before, the chemistry among the 
four lead consultants is palpable. 
While you might know Bell from 

“Veronica Mars” and her scattered 
big-screen efforts, or Schwartz for 
his role as Jean-Ralphio on “Parks 
and Recreation,” all four of the 
principle actors have steadily been 
delivering their best work as key 
ingredients of “Lies” ’s consulting 
quad.

Following “House of Lies” is 

“Episodes,” or the closest we’ll ever 
get to another season of “Friends.” 
In the biting show business sat-
ire, Matt LeBlanc plays a fictional 
version of himself as he makes his 
return to sitcoms in the ill-fated 
“Pucks.” But there’s more to “Epi-
sodes” than its many references to 
NBC’s iconic comedy or Jennifer 
Aniston — though isn’t that really 
all it needs? Unlike “Shameless” 
and “House of Lies,” “Episodes” 
is a straight comedy, with each 
episode delivering laugh-out-loud 
one-liners and gags.

But no matter how good both 

comedies are or have been in the 
past, the story of Showtime’s Sun-
day nights is undoubtedly “Shame-
less,” a show that’s simply too good 
to be ignored. This year, “Shame-
less” did manage to finally make its 
way into the awards conversation 
with its controversial move from 
drama — where the series had 
been submitted for consideration 
for its first three years — to com-
edy, despite its fourth season being 
its darkest and most dramatic yet. 
This coincided with “Orange Is the 
New Black” ’s — another difficult-
to-pin-down dramedy — decision 
to enter the race as a comedy after 
spending some time categorized 
as a drama. In 2015, “Orange” lead 
Taylor Schilling was nominated for 
Lead Actress in a Comedy Series at 
the Golden Globes, despite being 
nominated for the same role in the 
drama category the previous year.

But as with “Orange,” “Shame-

less” ’s category swap did manage 
to work some magic, landing Wil-
liam H. Macy an Emmy nomina-
tion, a Golden Globe nomination 
and a SAG Award win for his 
portrayal as Frank Gallagher. It 
had been a long time coming, not 
solely because Macy has shined in 
the role for years, but because all 
of these Academies and Associa-
tions and Guilds are usually very 
quick to honor Showtime’s lead-
ing actors. Claire Danes, David 
Duchovny, Mary-Louise Parker, 
Don Cheadle, Edie Falco, Matt 
LeBlanc, Toni Collette, Laura 
Linney, Liev Schreiber and Lizzy 
Caplan have all consistently been 
honored for their work on the 
network. But while William H. 
Macy’s name can now be added to 
that list, there is still one person 
who is sorely lacking the recogni-

tion she deserves.

As Fiona Gallagher, the Chica-

go-native in charge of caring for 
her five younger siblings, Emmy 
Rossum has been delivering tele-
vision’s single greatest perfor-
mance. More dimensional and 
complicated than Macy’s Frank, 
Rossum’s nuanced, natural per-
formance stands at the show’s 
core — the battered, beaten, 
tough-as-nails, resilient heart of 
“Shameless.” Whether the series 
is funny or sad or serious (in real-
ity, it’s all of these things), Rossum 
handles her scenes with dedica-
tion and care, masterfully weav-
ing between genres as well as, say, 
Rose Byrne, an actress as great 
in the dark, dramatic television 
series “Damages” as she is in the 
summer blockbuster “Neighbors.”

But Rossum takes it even fur-

ther than Byrne, with the pen-
dulum of emotions swinging 
so quickly in “Shameless,” as if 
Byrne’s character in the Seth 
Rogen romp were meant to face 
off with “Damage” ’s Glenn Close 
at “Neighbor” ’s conclusion. In 
the season four episode, “There’s 
the Rub,” Fiona’s at-that-moment 
blissful exuberance comes crash-
ing down when she discovers her 
toddler-brother 
unconscious, 

having inhaled the remainder 
of her celebratory cocaine. That 
shift in Fiona, exemplified with 
perfection by Rossum, should 
have ended the Emmy conversa-
tion right there. In an ideal world, 
Julianna 
Margulies’s 
second 

statue for “The Good Wife” would 
be on Rossum’s mantel. But this 
isn’t an ideal world, and Rossum’s 
performance went without even a 
nomination for the fourth year in 
a row.

This season, the emotional 

roller coaster of Fiona Gallagher 
hasn’t ceased to roar on — a shot-
gun wedding in one episode, the 
return of former love Jimmy in 
another. Even better, “Shameless” 
’s surrounding action continues to 
shine as well: Frank’s attempts to 
remain sober, Lip’s struggle to bal-
ance his new life at college with his 
old friends on the South Side, Ian’s 
tragic surrendering to his bipolar 
disorder and Kev and V’s fractured 
relationship post-pregnancy. With 
each episode, “Shameless” accom-
plishes so much. It’s dramatic. It’s 
hilarious. It’s unique. But most 
importantly, it’s raw, real and relat-
able. “Shameless” is television at its 
finest. Why aren’t you watching?

Marian Hill needs to 
have a wider audience

By CATHERINE BAKER

For the Daily

In the midst of an extremely 

busy week, I’ve turned to Mari-
an Hill for solace. After recently 
being introduced to the Phila-
delphian electronic pop duo, 
the seven songs they currently 
have on Spotify have kept me 
company as I walk to class and 
struggle through what should 
be an illegal amount of home-
work. It’s amazing what a good 
saxophone solo can do for the 
soul.

Since the pair has not been 

introduced to Wikipedia yet, 
I’ve had to glean what little 
information I have from their 
Facebook page, which has just 
under 14,000 likes. Jeremy 
Lloyd and Samantha Gongol 
first came in contact with each 
other at a middle school talent 
show where Lloyd heard Gon-
gol sing for the first time. After 
drifting apart, the pair reunited 
in Lloyd’s bedroom studio many 
years later and formed Marian 
Hill. Lloyd and Gongol’s first 
EP, Play, was released in early 
2014 and contained five songs, 
each of which use different 
aspects of electronic pop and 

sultry lyrics to create a sound 
unique to Marian Hill.

Their more recent releases, 

“Lips” and “Got It,” continue 
the development of carefully 
constructed beats and overlay-
ing harmonies introduced in 
Play, but the minimalist lyrical 
style leaves plenty of room for 
variations in rhythm. In today’s 
Top 40, I struggle with finding 
new and interesting lyrics — 
there are only so many times I 
can listen to a sad song about a 
one night stand or an anthem 
about partying on a weeknight. 
I understand these ideas are 
recycled due to their relevance 
to the audience, but isn’t there 
anything more interesting to 
write about than the club going 
up on a Tuesday? Why not make 
it a Wednesday and shake things 
up a little?

I am not asserting that Mar-

ian Hill isn’t a newfound lyrical 
genius that writes about every 
aspect of the human experi-
ence. My fantasies of new and 
untouched topics are a pipe 
dream because, let’s face it, 
nearly every emotion under the 
sun has been sung, played or 
rapped. Lloyd and Gongol sim-
ply take these same ideas that 

many other songwriters use — 
love, commitment, heartbreak 
— and simplify them down to 
their very bones, combining raw 
emotions with haunting vocals 
and interesting blends of clas-
sic instruments and electronic 
pulses. The point isn’t that they 
magically come up with new 
topics to sing about; the point 
is that they sing about these 
common topics with a new spin 
that many pop icons often lack. 
Though I am not a fan of pure 
electronic music, I appreciate 
their more synthetic tracks sim-
ply because of the individuality 
coursing through each piece. 
Even the popular saxophone 
solo finds a place in “Got It,” yet 
still retains its own contempo-
rary twist.

Marian 
Hill 
may 
never 

become a household name, but 
I wouldn’t write them off just 
yet. As I’ve written this, their 
Facebook page gleaned another 
1,000 likes and their next EP is 
set to release on Feb. 17. While 
Marian Hill is still in its early 
stages of development, I look 
forward to seeing what the duo 
has in store and eagerly await 
the day they have their own 
Wikipedia page.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

NYFW: Oscar de la 
Renta’s brand lives on

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

Oscar de la Renta once said, 

“the great thing about fashion 
is that it always looks forward.” 
It’s true — designers of esteemed 
fashion houses and editors of 
high-brow fashion magazines 
foresee and create our sartorial 
future. In the midst of winter, 
top designers showcase next 
fall’s collections, and the Septem-
ber issues of high-brow fashion 
magazines are planned years in 
advance. De la Renta looked for-
ward, too. He forecasted both 
fashion’s future and the fate of 
his eponymous empire. Merely a 
week before he lost his eight-year 

battle with intermittent lympho-
ma, de la Renta appointed Peter 
Copping as his successor. Though 
maintaining de la Renta’s signa-
ture elegant femininity posed 
an undeniably daunting task, it’s 
clear Copping’s debut collection 
exceeded expectations.

All of the industry’s most 

scrutinizing eyes were given 
the benefit of the doubt as 
Copping delivered a quintes-
sentially Oscar collection with 
appropriate 
and 
innovative 

personal touches. Copping paid 
homage to the late tastemaker 
with fairytale frocks, dirndl 
skirts and lettuce hems, yet 
added an edgier, gothic flair 
with a black fringed ’70s shift 

dress and ball gowns consist-
ing of unconventional, sheer 
bodices with textured overlays. 
In typical de la Renta attention 
to detail, subliminal romantic 
touches of ornate embellish-
ment and unlined lace beneath 
coat and suit dresses added a 
sophisticated polish to many 
looks. Immaculate eveningwear 
stole the show, particularly a 
strapless, ombré magenta mini 
dress with textured rosettes 
and a fitted, floor-length gown 
of jeweled applique atop cobalt 
faille. As the finale concluded, 
the show’s audience and live-
streamers alike were relieved 
knowing Copping successfully 
wrote the new chapter of ODLR.

STYLE RECAP

NYFW: Erin 
Featherston

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

Flirty, sweet and the epitome 

of charming, Erin Fetherston 
makes everyday beauty seem 
effortless. Her designs are the 
kind of clothes you would want 
to wear when you meet your 
boyfriend’s family for the first 
time — with options for the pos-
sibility of attending a wedding, a 
casual brunch or even a funeral 
(distant relatives, only).

Fetherston’s NYFW 2015 col-

lection has incredible range and 
covers all occasions. From casu-
al red carpet chic, to cocktail 
night with your ladies, to brunch 
the next morning, to date night 
that evening, just pluck a wear-
able combo from the line and 
walk out the door. These are the 
kind of clothes I hope I would 
wear if I were a working woman 
in a working city and wanted to 
seem on top of my game, but also 
like I woke up with no real agen-
da other than appearing ethere-

al for the entire day. Fetherston 
plays with organic textures, 
opening the show with white 
doily cut out patterns and slow-
ly transforming the fabric into 
a sheer deep turquoise pattern 
by the end. An incorporation 
of bright, rich jewel tones was 
an unexpected surprise after a 
continuous stream of black and 
white looks.

Flirty capes, ankle strap heels 

and a clean, pulled back look 
dominated the captivating run-
way. High collars and full skirts 
that may have looked timid on 
any other runway played off as 
expressively demure. Top looks 
include a refreshing take on a 
tank and skirt combination with 
a play on proportions, allowing 
the plain tank to fall delicately 
over a patterned, flowing skirt; 
a white tank with swing floral 
pants; and a buttoned high-neck 
black coat layered over a ruby 
red shift dress that indicated a 
mood shift near the end of the 
show.

TV REVIEW
‘Jinx’ shows truth 
at its most grizzly

HBO docu-series 
explores crimes of 

Robert Durst

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

In 2001, a Texas teenager 

found a dismembered torso in 
the Galveston Bay. The subse-
quent 
investi-

gation 
became 

one of the most 
enigmatic cases 
in United States 
history. This is 
how HBO’s doc-
umentary mini-
series “The Jinx: 
The 
Life 
and 

Deaths of Robert 
Durst” 
begins. 

At 
the 
start, 

director Andrew 
Jarecki (“All Good Things”) 
makes a clear statement to the 
viewer: reality is always more 
gruesome than fiction.

The series’ primary subject 

is the perpetrator of the crime, 
Robert Durst, the son of one 
of New York City’s wealthiest 
real estate moguls. Between 
the 1980s and 2000s, Durst 
was twice acquitted for murder 
and has been linked to at least 
three known disappearances. 
In 2001, he was the center of a 
high-profile manhunt across 
multiple state lines. Now, with 
“The Jinx,” he has agreed to sit 
down with filmmaker Andrew 
Jarecki for a tell-all, face-to-
face interview.

The first episode, “The Body 

in the Bay,” doesn’t feature the 
interview itself but it sets up 
for a miniseries that promises 
to shock, provoke, thrill, appall 
and mesmerize all who watch. 
The series’ opening features real 
photos of the crime telling us 
that if you’re too disturbed by it, 
change the channel to “Law and 
Order.” This case is real.

“The Jinx” draws viewers 

in with interviews, video clips, 
photographs and evidence from 
the crime. The case extends to 
Durst’s relatives, friends, and 
any other individuals somehow 
connected or affected by the 
case. In this, the film creates 
a web of intrigue with Robert 
Durst at the center.

In his essay, “The Simple Art 

of Murder,” crime-fiction icon 
Raymond Chandler once said 
Dashiell Hammett — whose 
contributions 
to 
American 

crime fiction rival those of 
Edgar Allan Poe — “gave mur-
der back to the kind of people 
who commit it.” This authen-
ticity is what makes “The Jinx” 
more enthralling than any hour 
on CBS where good-looking 
movie stars dodge explosions 
with snarky quips. Not to say 
that fictional shows can’t cap-
ture the reality of American 
crime — just look at “The Sopra-
nos,” “True Detective,” “The 
Wire” and “Breaking Bad.” But 
what Jarecki proves is truth 
will always be more interesting 
than fiction, and this miniseries 
is most certainly the truth, in 
all its filthy, horrible, grotesque 
magnificence.

The series premiere might 

disappoint some hoping to see 
the interview with Durst, which 
is treated as a cliffhanger at the 
end of the episode. There’s also 
quite a bit of focus on the gori-
ness of the Galveston crime. 
The real-life violence will para-
lyze most with its explicitness, 
but you wonder if the gritty 
details depicted will distract 
and turn off certain viewers 
from the series’ more interest-
ing aspects.

As for Jarecki’s style, the 

filmmaker that most comes to 
mind is Errol Morris, whose 
1988 true crime classic “The 
Thin Blue Line” revolutionized 
cinema when it saved the life 
of a man falsely accused of 
murdering a police officer. The 
cool, slick and atmospheric 
reenactments and the Philip 
Glass-inspired score are highly 
reminiscent of Morris. It’s too 
early to say what surprises 
Jarecki and his subject, Robert 
Durst, have planned, but the 
first episode promises that 
“The Jinx” will be well worth 
watching … as long as the 
viewer remembers to keep the 
lights on.

DAILY BOOK REVIEW

Dark, moving ‘Rich 
and Strange’ delights

By FRANCESCA KIELB

Daily Arts Writer

I never cry while watching 

movies. To me, the beauty 
of fiction lies in observing 
another world 
without having 
to actually take 
part in it. But I 
have to tell you 
how refreshing 
it 
is, 
every 

once in awhile, 
to really feel 
something. To 
be transported. 
To 
feel 
the 

pain of those you never have 
and never will meet and come 
out on the other side somehow 
different.

Author Ron Rash captures 

the beauty of intense, gritty 
reality by using small poi-
gnant scenes to get at underly-
ing truths. He transports you 
to places that you know exist 
but spend your days ignoring. 
Yet once you start reading, you 
don’t want to stop; you don’t 
want to put your blinders back 
on. In fact, you can’t.

The 434 pages of Rash’s 

“Something Rich and Strange” 
are sliced into 34 separate short 
stories. The stories take place 
in different times and have dif-
ferent perspectives, some first 
person, some third. They all 
take place in the same Appa-
lachian region. Rash provides 
many small scenes and snippets 
of lives that when read together 
give the reader an understand-
ing of a regional culture.

Series of short stories often 

run the risk of feeling dis-
jointed when placed side by 
side, especially stories such as 
these, with such drastic plot, 
character and time shifts. Rash 
is successful in his compila-
tion because the stories, though 
technically different, explore 
the same themes from a variety 
of angles. His characters are 
driven by forces such as pride, 
hope, desperation and a need 
for deliverance that any reader, 
regardless of their walk of life, 

can relate to. These themes are 
addressed in all 34 of his sto-
ries, providing the reader with 
a medley of related yet distinct 
emotional responses.

And yet each story doesn’t 

try to cover all four of these 
themes. Instead, stories will 
alternate which themes are 
the focal point and which are 
merely undercurrents. Some 
stories vaguely reference these 
universal struggles, and some 
succinctly spell them out.

Instead of trying to skim 

the top of all 34 stories, I, like 
Rash, want to use small telling 
moments to convey the essence 
of the text.

In the first story, you are 

thrown into a world of extreme 
poverty. 
You 
find 
yourself 

wanting to discover who stole 
eggs from the aging couple 
Jacob and Edna. You cry when 
Edna accuses the starving 
neighbor’s dog and the neigh-
bor takes his dog right then and 
there and cuts his throat “just 
in case.” You feel your own 
stomach churn as Jacob tries to 
give food to the starving family, 
but the father, Hartley, refuses 
because, “I ain’t got no money 
to buy it.” His willingness to 
suffer rather than lose what lit-
tle pride remains brings tears to 
my eyes. Tears I don’t waste on 
make-believe. Now I’m crying 
about imagined dead dogs and 
eggs goddamnit. Still I read on.

Now I’m reading about a 

woman who lives her life in 
solitude after a traumatic acci-
dent. She takes up a job run-
ning the night shift at the 
radio and slowly starts to feel 
an intangible connection with 
the audience she talks to every 
night. The station’s red beacon 
is described as a pulsing heart, 
“giving bearing to all those in 
the dark adrift and alone.” I 
start to believe that maybe there 
is a common thread that ties us 
together, even those wandering 
alone. That maybe those in the 
deepest darkest holes of isola-
tion which Rash portrays so 
well are not lost — not hopeless.

Yet just when you almost feel 

elated, almost feel like you’ve 
conquered the darkness and 
can close the book, Rash reels 
you back in with renewed ven-
geance. He delves into the lives 
of those caught in a culture of 
meth addiction. You feel hatred 
as they harm those around 
them, then sympathy as they 
harm themselves. I experi-
ence a place where “food and 
warmth and clothing were no 
longer important,” where “the 
only essentials were the red-
and-white packs a sudafed in 
the passenger’s seat.” Rash rips 
away the hope he works so hard 
to instill, only to build it back up 
again.

Through waves of pride, hope 

and desperation you find your-
self and the characters search-
ing for deliverance. A boy seeks 
refuge from addict parents in 
a snowy wood and climbs into 
a crashed airplane. As he sits 
among the dead and dreams for 
a world in the sky, he almost 
believes that the plane will take 
off. The boy “knew that they had 
taken off and risen so high that 
they were enveloped inside a 
cloud, but still he looked down, 
waiting for the clouds to clear.” 
And then you feel an indescrib-
able yet powerful need for some, 
any, subliminal force — for the 
existence of a beyond.

While reading Ron Rash’s 

“Something Rich and Strange,” 
you never really know if your 
hope is warranted, you will 
question the likelihood of a 
salvation, but at the end of 
each story you will always flip 
to the next one, hoping to find 
out. Take a risk — don’t be 
comfortable. Maybe you’ll find 
something worth crying for. I 
certainly did.

You will question 
the likelihood of 

salvation.

‘M’ travels to Tuscaloosa

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

With mixed results against 

two 
southern 
powerhouses 

already, the No. 5 Michigan 
softball team 
will 
look 

for 
another 

early-season 
statement 
against No. 3 
Alabama. The 
Wolverines 
travel 
to 

Tuscaloosa 
this weekend 
looking 
to 

keep 
their 

eight-game 
win 
streak 

alive.

For 
the 

third 
time 

in 
three 

weeks, 
the 

Wolverines (8-1) are going up 
against 
a 
top-10 
opponent. 

Michigan has shown it can play 
with the best, beating No. 6 
Florida State twice in one day. 
Next in line is the Crimson Tide.

Throughout 
the 
weekend, 

the Wolverines will also play 
two games versus the Lipscomb 
and one against James Madison. 
While those games might not 
present the same challenge 
that the Crimson Tide pose, 
Michigan’s approach will be the 
same.

One of the Crimson Tide’s 

best assets this season has been 
pitcher 
Alexis 
Osorio. 
Last 

Sunday, the freshman ace threw 
a no-hitter against Pacific in 
a 10-0 victory and has a 4-0 
record to start her career.

Michigan 
will 
be 
ready, 

though, having already faced 
some very talented pitchers, 
most notably Florida State’s 
Lacey Waldrop. Osorio will 
surely be another tough test, but 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 

is making sure to keep her 
players calm while at bat.

“(Hutchins) is still focusing 

on staying loose and not trying 
to make too much of our 
swings,” said sophomore left 
fielder Kelly Christner. “A lot of 
what we’ve been practicing has 
been situational hitting. So not 
always thinking about trying 
to hit a home run but thinking 
that if there’s a runner on third, 
you need to try and hit to the 
outfield to score them.”

For Christner, consistency 

in the batter’s box has been 
key. She has managed to reach 
base in all nine games so far 
this season, finding a way to 
hit against every pitcher she’s 
faced.

“I just try to see a lot of 

pitches,” Christner said. “It 
really depends on the pitcher. 
If she’s trying to attack you 
first and you want to swing at 
that first one, go ahead, but 
whenever you see more pitches, 
at least for me, I feel better in 
the at-bat. I feel like I can see 

the ball better, and I’m not just 
giving her an easy out. I want to 
make her work for that out.”

While the team is always 

focused on improving its hitting, 
Hutchins turned to the defense 
as the focus of practice this 
week. In the first game against 
the Seminoles last weekend, 
Florida State managed to hit 
its way back to a one-run lead 
by three consecutive infield 
singles.

“We want to show up with our 

short game defense,” Hutchins 
said. “It wasn’t very good last 
weekend. It’s just a matter of 
getting a little more certainty. 
It’s tough, especially when you 
have to deal with slappers and 
bunts. We’ve worked on that a 
bit now.”

The battle for starting infield 

spots has been evident thus far 
into the season. Hutchins has 
not determined any starters at 
these positions, and multiple 
infielders have seen playing 
time, including freshman Taylor 
Swearingen. Swearingen, who 

has started six different games 
in three different spots, is 
hoping to get into the starting 
lineup more consistently.

“In the beginning of the year, 

I would’ve said I play best at 
first base,” Swearingen said. 
“But I’ve been getting a ton 
more comfortable at all of my 
positions now, and I’ve been 
practicing all over the field. I 
want to prove my consistency 
and be a little more aggressive.”

Because of the star power in 

both dugouts, fans will be able 
to watch the games against the 
Crimson Tide online. Friday 
afternoon, the Wolverines will 
play at 5 p.m. on ESPN3.

Michigan has already made 

clear it can compete with the 
best, but this weekend it will 
have the chance to let fans 
everywhere see that live.

“I hope fans think, ‘Wow, 

Michigan 
has 
incredible 

energy,’ ” Christner said. “ 
‘They’re always playing every 
pitch to win, never letting an 
inning up.’ ”

Big Ten announces 
2015-16 matchups

Michigan to play 
MSU, OSU only 
once next season

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

The Big Ten announced the 

outline of its men’s basketball 
schedule for 2015-16 on Thursday, 
unveiling a slate that is, at least 
for Michigan, light on rivalry 
games.

After playing home-and-home 

series against Michigan State 
and Ohio State this season, the 
Wolverines will play each of 
those teams just once next year. 
The clash with the Spartans will 
take place at Crisler Center, while 
Michigan will travel to Columbus 
to take on the Buckeyes.

The Wolverines have home-

and-home series scheduled with 
Iowa, 
Maryland, 
Minnesota, 

Penn State and Purdue next 
season. One of the contests with 
the Nittany Lions, though, will 
be played at Madison Square 
Garden in New York. Per MLive.
com’s Brendan Quinn, the New 
York game will be Penn State’s 
home game, and the teams will 
also meet in Ann Arbor.

Single-play games at home, 

in addition to Michigan State, 
are Indiana, Northwestern and 
Rutgers. Maryland’s visit to Ann 
Arbor will be its first as a member 
of the Big Ten.

To round out its schedule, 

Michigan will travel for single-
play games at Illinois, Nebraska 
and Wisconsin.

All schedule dates — with the 

exception of the “Big Ten Day” 
clash in New York — have yet 
to be determined, as have game 
times and television broadcast 

information.

The 2016 Big Ten Tournament 

will be held at Banker’s Life 
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis after 
spending the 2013 through 2015 
at the United Center in Chicago.

The 
Big 
Ten’s 
schedule 

has changed substantially in 
recent years as the conference’s 
membership 
increased 
from 

11 to 14. Nebraska joined the 
conference 
in 
the 
summer 

of 2011, while Maryland and 
Rutgers joined the conference in 
the summer of 2014.

The 
additions 
forced 
a 

drastic increase in single-play 
competition. With an 11-team 
membership, 
the 
conference 

was able to facilitate home-and-
home series for the vast majority 
of pairings, an ability that 
vanished when the membership 
grew by three teams and the 
conference schedule held steady 
at 18 regular-season games. Since 
the league’s expansion, Big Ten 
teams play five opponents twice 
and eight opponents once.

Michigan 
had 
single-play 

pairings just twice per season in 
2009-10 and 2010-11, the years 
before Nebraska’s addition to the 
conference. In both seasons, the 
Wolverines played Purdue and 
Illinois once each, alternating 
venues each season.

In 2011-12, the first year of 

the Cornhuskers’ membership, 
Michigan played four teams — 
Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin 
and Iowa — only once each during 
the Big Ten regular season.

The 
Wolverines’ 
home 

schedule features four of the 
seven teams currently in the top 
half of the Big Ten standings: 
Maryland, 
Michigan 
State, 

Purdue and Indiana. Similarly, the 
road schedule features four teams 
currently in the bottom half.

over 
Indiana at 
Crisler Center.

Freshman 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty got her first start since 
November and excelled, scoring 
21 points while senior guard 
Shannon Smith and sophomore 
guard Siera Thompson totaled 16 
and 15 points, respectively.

Down low in the post, senior 

forward 
Cyesha 
Goree 
was 

able to operate with her usual 
intensity. She only picked up one 
foul, unlike her last two games, 
in which she fouled out.

After knocking off Indiana 

on 
Wednesday 
night, 
the 

Wolverines (7-8 Big Ten, 15-11 
overall) had to quickly change 
their mindset and focus on 
traveling to Minneapolis to play 
the last team on its regular-
season schedule ranked higher 
than them in the Big Ten.

Currently ranked No. 4 in 

the Big Ten and No. 37 in the 
RPI, the Golden Gophers come 
into Saturday’s game riding 
a four-game winning streak 
including, most recently, an 
impressive 93-80 win over No. 
13 Iowa on Tuesday, and a win 
over Minnesota would give the 
Wolverines a big win before the 
Big Ten Tournament begins in 
two weeks.

The Golden Gophers (10-5, 

21-6) have played a majority 
of the season without Big Ten 
Preseason Player of the Year 
guard Rachel Banham, who 
suffered a torn anterior cruciate 
ligament on Dec. 10 against 
North Dakota and is out for the 
season.

In the absence of Banham’s 

22.1 points per game last season, 
Golden Gopher center and 2014 
Big Ten Freshman of the Year 
Amanda Zahui B. has taken over 
the bulk of the scoring. Zahui 
totaled a career-high 39 points 
and 29 rebounds in Minnesota’s 
win over Iowa. Zahui is also in 
the hunt for the John R. Wooden 
Award, given to the best player in 
the nation, as she was named to 
the Top 20 list last week.

The Daily sat down with Zahui 

at Big Ten Media Day in October 
to discuss her upcoming season, 
the weather in Minnesota and 
the transition from Swedish to 
American basketball.

The Michigan Daily: It’ll be 

your second year at Minnesota. 
How do you improve on last 
year’s All-Big Ten First Team 
performance?

Amanda Zahui B.: Well, this 

year, I just want to become more 
versatile and become faster and 
quicker on the court, so I can 
match up against the bigger 

players.

TMD: 
Coming 
from 

Sweden, what was the biggest 
difference in the style of play 
between American and Swedish 
basketball?

AZ: Well it’s quicker, fast-

paced and it’s rougher, if I can put 
it that way.

TMD: Like more physical?
AZ: Yeah, more physical, but 

definitely the pace is the biggest 
difference.

TMD: 
You 
were 
on 
the 

Swedish national team. How did 
playing internationally help you 
out when you came to Minnesota?

AZ: I got to play against players 

that played professionally, while 
on the national team, that had 
more experience playing against 
some of the best players in the 
world in the Euro League. I 
also got to play against other 
players in college. It was fun, 
it really helped me develop my 
game because you mixed a lot of 
cultures of basketball together.

Wolverines seek historic 
win over Fighting Irish

Michigan 0-16 all-

time vs. ranked 

teams; plays Notre 
Dame on Saturday

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

The men’s lacrosse team is 

already enjoying a historic week.

For the first time in program 

history, Michi-
gan 
received 

votes 
in 
the 

Inside Lacrosse 
rankings, 
while 
sopho-

more attacker 
Ian King was 
voted Big Ten 
Offensive Play-
er of the Week 
after earning a 
school single-
game 
record 

of eight points 
against Detroit last week.

Saturday, the Wolverines will 

have the opportunity to make 
more history when they play 
No. 2 Notre Dame in front of an 
expected record crowd at Ooster-
baan Field House.

In its brief three plus years 

of existence, Michigan is 0-16 
against ranked opponents. An 
overtime defeat at the hands of 
then-No. 15 Cornell last year was 
the closest the Wolverines have 
come to knocking off a top-20 
team.

“After our Cornell game last 

year and how we prepared that 
week, we’re all looking forward 
to this game,” said senior attacker 
Will Meter. “This year it’s differ-
ent. We’re not saying we can hang 
with this team anymore, we’re 
saying we can beat them.”

After opening the season with 

two comfortable victories, confi-
dence is flowing among players 
and staff. The Wolverines cur-
rently lead the country in caused 
turnovers per game, own 52 shots 

on goal and have outscored oppo-
nents 18-3 in the second half.

“Something 
we’ve 
never 

been able to do in the past is put 
together a complete game, espe-
cially in the second half,” Meter 
said. “It shows the confidence 
we’re all playing with.”

While Michigan had little 

trouble taming Bellarmine and 
Detroit, Notre Dame is a whole 
different animal.

The Fighting Irish return 

three All-Americans from their 
NCAA runner-up team. The 
fourth-ranked incoming fresh-
man in 2014, Mikey Wynne, 
started his collegiate career by 
scoring six goals in a 14-12 victory 
over Georgetown.

“(Wynne’s) IQ of the game and 

the way he goes about the game 
really makes him effective and 
unique,” said freshman midfield-
er BJ Mattheiss, Wynne’s high 
school teammate. “He helped 
us win in so many ways. I can’t 
speak enough of him.”

For years, the Fighting Irish 

have been best known for their 
airtight defense, but recently, 
Notre Dame’s attack has been 
grabbing all the headlines. Led 
by attacker Matt Kavanaugh, 
who earned 75 points last sea-
son, the Fight-
ing Irish will 
bring one of 
the country’s 
most dynamic 
offenses 
to 

Oosterbaan on 
Saturday.

“Right now, 

you 
watch 

them on film, 
and 
their 

offense might 
be scarier than their defense,” 
said Michigan coach John Paul. 
“They are a complete team. For us 
to compete in a game like that at 
the stage we’re at right now, we’ve 
got to play a mistake-free game.”

Saturday’s matchup has the 

potential to be a high-scoring 
shootout, especially if the Wol-
verines’ offense can maintain its 

recent form.

Michigan’s 
new 
offense 

includes fast-paced transition, 
and the Wolverines have already 
created more opportunities in 
transition than all of last sea-
son. Overall, Michigan’s 31 goals 
are the second-most the team 
has ever scored in a two-game 
stretch.

“We’re pushing it a lot more 

now,” Paul said. “We have the 
athletes to do it. It fits what we’re 
trying to do in our game, and the 
guys love it.”

The odds may not be in the 

Wolverines’ 
favor 
heading 

into 
Saturday, 

but that could 
help Michigan’s 
cause. 
With 

nothing to lose 
and everything 
to gain against 
Notre 
Dame, 

the lack of pres-
sure combined 
with 
recent 

success and growing confidence 
could be enough to spark an 
upset for the Wolverines’ history 
books.

“I think the excitement and 

the morale of playing the big, No. 
2 team in Notre Dame makes our 
team that much more motivated 
and to go out and get the win,” 
Mattheiss said.

Michigan reschedules tourney, 
will play four in Georgia instead

Weather moves 
Wolverines to 

Savannah for four 
weekend games

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

had long planned to travel to 
Greenville, North Carolina to 
participate in the Keith LeClair 
Classic along with host East 
Carolina, No. 25 Liberty and St. 
John’s.

But Mother Nature put the 

kibosh on the tournament as 
very cold temperatures and ice 
forced East Carolina to make 
schedule changes that kept the 
Wolverines (1-2) from traveling 
there. Michigan will instead 
travel to Savannah, Georgia to 
take on Tennessee Tech and 
Davidson in alternating games 
Friday through Sunday. The 
Wolverines will play in two 
contests on Saturday.

The trip to Greenville was 

supposed to be a poignant 
homecoming for Michigan coach 
Erik 
Bakich 
and 
recruiting 

coordinator Nick Schnabel: In 
1999 and 2000, the two men 
manned the infield for the 
Pirates under then-head coach 
Keith LeClair. LeClair tragically 
passed away in 2006 after a five-
year battle with ALS.

“I’ll always be a Pirate in 

regard of loving the school that 
I got to be a student-athlete at,” 
Bakich said. “Keith LeClair was 
an incredible man.”

The scheduling alterations 

came with short notice for the 
Wolverines. The announcement 
that Michigan would not travel 
to the Keith LeClair Classic came 
Wednesday, and the Wolverines 
did not know whom they would 
face or when they would play 
until Thursday night.

Michigan’s 
first 
opponent, 

Tennessee Tech (2-1), posted 
40-19 record in 2014, meaning 
they will likely give Michigan a 
challenge. The Golden Eagles’ 
biggest threat is Jake Farr, who 

went 5-for-9 with six runs in a 
Saturday doubleheader versus 
Longwood.

As for Davidson (1-1), the 

Wildcats split a pair of games 
with Appalachian State last 
weekend. They find themselves 
in a similar situation as the 
Wolverines, 
as 
Davidson’s 

scheduled contests with Lehigh 
and Army were scratched due to 
inclement weather.

Despite 
the 
spontaneous 

plan changes, Bakich expressed 
confidence in his team going into 
the weekend.

“I think we match up well 

against anyone when we play our 
best baseball,” he said. “I would 
put us up against anyone when 
we’re firing on all cylinders.”

Against Long Beach State, 

Michigan 
looked 
far 
from 

smashing 
this 
ceiling. 
The 

Wolverines dropped their first 
two games against the Dirtbags, 
3-2 and 7-2, respectively, before 
winning Sunday’s contest, 5-3, in 
10 innings.

“Long Beach State was very 

crafty in the way that they 
pitched us, and gave us some 
trouble,” Bakich said. “We didn’t 
get very many fastballs, and so 
we just have to do a better job of 
taking what the pitching gives to 
us. It was a good opportunity to 

use as a teachable moment.”

The Wolverines were also 

forced to contend with some 
injuries 
during 
the 
series, 

including one to junior shortstop 
Travis Maezes, who sat out 
Sunday’s win.

“(Maezes) hurt himself in the 

Saturday game,” Bakich said. 
“We held him out as a precaution 
on Sunday, but he’ll be back 
this weekend according to the 
training staff.”

While junior first baseman and 

pitcher Jacob Cronenworth hit a 
game-winning, two-run single 
in the top of the 10th inning on 
Sunday, he was unable to come 
out of the bullpen to close any 
games against the Dirtbags due 
to soreness. That forced the right-
handed trio of senior Donnie 
Eaton, junior Matt Ogden and 
sophomore Mac Lozer to take a 
stab at the closing role.

The 
closing 
job 
is 

Cronenworth’s, but Bakich isn’t 
afraid to look further down his 
bench if needed.

“It would be a group of guys 

making a group effort,” Bakich 
said, regarding his relievers. 
“That’s a nice option that we 
have. We can match up well with 
righties and lefties and different 
hitter strengths based on our 
strengths.”

Cronenworth, 
however, 
is 

expected to be healthy for the 
series against Tennessee Tech 
and Davidson.

“(Cronenworth) didn’t have 

anything unusual,” Bakich said. 
“Everyone is dinged up, but 
the guys are doing a great job 
competing. Our training staff 
does a great job at keeping our 
guys off the injury list or keeping 
their stays on it very short. I’m 
confident that we will be full 
steam ahead going into this 
weekend.” 

In 
spite 
of 
the 
losses 

and 
injuries, 
Michigan 
got 

promising performances out of 
several of its freshmen pitchers 
versus 
Long 
Beach 
State. 

Southpaw Michael Hendrickson 
and righty Bryan Pall teamed 
up for a combined 5.2 innings 
of 
relief 
pitching 
Saturday, 

allowing two runs with five 
strikeouts. Right-hander Ryan 
Nutof pitched 5.2 innings in his 
start Sunday, letting in only one 
earned run and striking out four 
batters.

While playing the Golden 

Eagles 
and 
the 
Wildcats 

wasn’t the original plan for the 
Wolverines, with the temperate 
weather, they will still relish 
the opportunity to compete this 
weekend.

‘M’ faces revamped, 
healthy OSU team

Wolverines have 
won nine of 10 

against Buckeyes

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

To say the Michigan hockey 

team has had the upper hand 
against 
Ohio 
State 
recently 

would be a gross understatement.

Since 2011, the Wolverines 

(8-4 Big Ten, 16-10 overall) have 
gone 9-0-1 against their neigh-
bors to the south. The Buckeyes 
have been outscored 52-28 in 
those contests, 18 of those com-
ing in just two games this sea-
son.

But as No. 15 Michigan has lost 

three of its last four games, Ohio 
State (3-9, 8-16-2) has improved 
and, more importantly, gotten 
healthy. The two teams will bat-
tle it out once again in Columbus 
on Friday, then in Ann Arbor on 
Sunday.

“They’re a different team, let’s 

face it,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson to MGoBlue.com. 
“When we played them last game 
(on Jan. 16), they had seven regu-
lars out, they couldn’t even dress 
a full lineup of players because of 
injuries, so they’re a whole differ-
ent team, a different animal.

“They’ll want revenge, and 

we’ve go to go down there and 
keep pace.”

In addition to injuries, the 

Buckeyes have struggled to get 
the most out of their players who 
are on the ice. Ohio State leads 
the conference in game miscon-
ducts, surrender 3.5 goals per 
game, hasn’t been able to get the 
most out of what was thought 
to be a two-headed force in net 
between Matt Tomkins and 
Christian Frey.

The Buckeyes have dropped 

seven of eight games during the 
stretch, ruining any postseason 
aspirations.

“It really came down to who-

ever was less bad would play,” 
said Matthew McGreevy, a stu-
dent reporter and broadcaster for 
Big Ten Network and Ohio State 

student radio. “It was pretty hard 
to watch. They had the injuries, 
but the problems were so much 
more than that.”

This time, however, the Buck-

eyes are much closer to full 
strength. With injuries, suspen-
sions and position battles pretty 
much over, a new energy has 
arisen in Columbus.

“Wednesday’s practice was 

really the first time since Novem-
ber that everyone was back,” 
McGreevy said. “The team seems 
really excited to play, rather than 
just saying they’re excited.”

After dropping three of its last 

four games, though, Michigan 
is more than ready to move on, 
especially against one of the Big 
Ten’s worst teams.

“We know that it’s a rivalry 

against Ohio State, but we’ve got 
to stay focused on what we’re 
going to do and how we’re going 
to win,” said sophomore forward 
JT Compher to MGoBlue.com. 
“It’s not going to be about them, 
it’s going to focus on how we play 
and how focused we are on get-
ting the win.”

In addition to returning to 

competition, 
the 
Wolverines 

are excited about another long-
awaited return. Sunday’s game 
will mark Michigan’s first home 
game since Jan. 10.

“It’s been a while,” Compher 

said. “I think everyone’s excited 
to get back to Yost, but we have 
a game in Columbus on Friday 
that’s at the forefront right now, 
so we’re focusing on that first.”

Michigan has dominated Ohio 

State for three seasons. But with 
a rejuvenated lineup, Berenson 
knows that edge can be far from 
safe.

“I think any time you have an 

edge on the team, you’ve really 
got to pay attention to detail,” 
Berenson said. “We’re going to 
see their best hockey, and we’re 
going to need to play better than 
we did last week.

“The records don’t really mean 

anything. I think they’re better 
than their record because of all 
the injuries, and we need to get 
better if we’re going to have a 
good record.”
