Central Student Government 
held its final meeting of the 
8th assembly Tuesday night. 
The assembly voted to pass 
several resolutions, including 
a 
resolution 
to 
designate 
University of Michigan Blue 
Bus 
routes 
from 
campus 
locations to grocery stores, 
as well as a resolution to 
improve pedestrian safety at 
the University. At the meeting, 
several 
non-CSG 
students 
presented a new idea for an app 
to better integrate first-year 

students when they first come 
to campus.
During 
community 
concerns, 
Engineering 
freshmen Sanil Gosain, Cooper 
Kennelly and Marcus Toure 
gave a presentation on their 
idea for a new app which would 
help first-year students adjust 
to the University. The app 
would provide freshmen with 
questions in academic, social 
and lifestyle categories and 
then use those results to match 
them with other students, clubs 
and organizations on campus. 

As a computer science 
major, LSA junior Armind 
Chahal often finds herself 
one of the only women in 
her upper-level CS courses. 
Chahal said though the 
uneven gender ratio in CS 
classes is significant, it is 
so commonplace that she 
has come to expect it and is 
usually able to ignore it.
“I went to a discussion, 
and there were 30 people 
in the class, and about four 
or five of us were women,” 
Chahal said. “I think it’s 
definitely noticeable once 

you get into the core classes 
for CS and even more 
noticeable once you get to 
the electives. You kind of 
just get used to it, I think, 
and it kind of seems like 
people get sick of hearing 
about it so you really just 
stop bringing it up after 
a certain point. You just 
ignore it and move on. 
That’s how I’ve coped with 
it.”
Currently, 
Chahal 
is 
taking 
Electrical 
Engineering 
and 
Computer 
Science 
376, 
an 
upper 
level 
course 
introducing 
students 
to 
the theory of computation. 

Though her professor and 
most of her peers are male, 
she 
noted 
how 
having 
a 
female 
instructional 
aide reminds her of the 
importance 
of 
equal 
gender 
representation 
in fields like computer 
science. In EECS courses, 
IAs are the equivalent of 
undergraduate 
teaching 
assistants who aid students 
in course material and lead 
lab sections.
“I 
think 
it’s 
very 
important that there is 
that even balance because 
even though you don’t 
have 
an 
even 
balance 
of women and men, the 

people who are in those 
power positions should be 
a balance,” Chahal said. “I 
think that will get more 
people to either stay in 
the program or start the 
program.”
Last 
month, 
a 
study 
published 
by 
three 
University 
of 
Michigan 
professors found the group 
of instructional aides for 
computer science classes 
at the University is nearly 
equally split between men 
and women, even though 
EECS 280, an introductory 
course for CS majors, is 
only 25 percent female.

The 
Office 
of 
Student 
Life hosted the Michigan 
Difference 
Student 
Leadership 
Awards 
on 
Tuesday 
to 
honor 
the 
outstanding work of various 
individuals 
and 
groups 
on 
campus. 
Thirty-seven 
groups 
and 
individuals 
were 
acknowledged 
for 
their work in public service, 
social justice, research and 
academic accomplishments.
Students are nominated 
by peers, faculty, and staff 
through 
an 
online 
form. 
This year, more than 300 
individuals and groups were 
nominated.
The 
award 
categories 
ranged from leadership in 
club sports, sustainability, 
fine 
arts, 
research 
and 
innovation 
and 
social 
change. 
Many 
of 
the 
awards acknowledged both 
an individual and group. 
Freshman, 
sophomore, 
junior, senior and graduate 
student of the year awards 
were also announced.

On Tuesday, approximately 
30 people attended “Check 
Your Privilege: The Game 
of Life,” an event hosted 
by the Chi Upsilon Sigma 
National Latin Sorority Inc. 
and Lambda Theta Phi Latin 

Fraternity 
Inc. 
to 
discuss 
the real life ramifications of 
privilege and inequality. 
The event featured multiple 
simulations to convey various 
forms of economic difficulty 
and realities. Following the 
simulations, attendees split 
into 
small 
groups 
before 
convening in a large group to 

discuss their thoughts.
According to LSA junior 
Salvador Vargas, a Lambda 
Theta Phi member who helped 
facilitate the discussions, the 
simulations were necessary to 
open up conversations about 
privilege.
“When we had the more 
collaborative 
event, 
the 

simulator in the second half, 
I think the reflection turned 
out well,” Vargas said. “It 
didn’t 
feel 
forced, 
people 
were very genuine sharing 
personal experiences, so I 
definitely think it was quality 
conversation.”

The University’s chapters of Chi Upsilon Sigma National Latin Sorority Inc. and Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity Inc. held an identity awareness event, “Game of 
Life: Check Your Privilege,” in East Quad Residence Hall Tuesday evening.


Once Fingerle Lumber Co. 
closes its doors Saturday, Arbor 
Bar, an entity of Union Joints, 
will move forward with plans to 
open a restaurant on Fingerle’s 
former 
45,000-square-foot 
site at South Main Street. They 
presented a restaurant proposal 
to the Ann Arbor Design Review 
Board on Feb. 13. Curt Catallo, 
co-owner 
of 
Union 
Joints 
restaurant group, feels confident 
about their plan to repurpose the 
old storage sheds of the Fingerle 
Millworks building by turning it 
into a two-story restaurant.
After 88 years of business, 

Fingerle will close on Saturday. 
Fingerle 
is 
a 
family-owned 
business that has been operating 
in downtown Ann Arbor since 
1931. 
The 
third-generation 
owners, brothers John and Mark 
Fingerle, will retire once they 
close their business. Fingerle 
did not respond to requests for 
comment. 
Catallo noted that all of the 
lumber came from Fingerle 
when their first restaurant, 
the Clarkston Union, was built 
in 1995. Additionally, Union 
Joints co-owner Ann Stevenson, 
Catallo’s wife, lived in Ann Arbor 
for several years and has always 
appreciated the site. Catallo said 
Union Joints is honored to have 

this opportunity. 
“This 
Fingerle 
Millworks 
building just checked all the 
boxes,” Catallo said. “It’s a 
building and a site that we 
fell in love with years ago and 
we’re very proud to be able to 
repurpose it and create a little 
something down by the railroad 
tracks.”
Catallo felt that this project 
naturally unfolded due to his 
team’s 
familiarity 
with 
the 
company, land and the city of 
Ann Arbor.
“In a way, we obviously knew 
the mill building and then it 
kind of came to us organically 
in that we knew it was there and 
we felt that it was a good fit,” 
Catallo said. “Friends told us 
about it and then we really 
worked with the Fingerles 
to try to make it so you could 
repurpose 
that 
structure 
not knowing what they were 
doing with the larger parcels 
that they sold to U of M.”
On Dec. 6, the University of 
Michigan’s Board of Regents 
authorized the $24 million 
purchase of 6.54 acres of 
another piece of Fingerle’s 
property located along Fifth 
Avenue and south of East 
Madison 
Street, 
but 
the 
University’s plan for this land 
remains up in the air.
Catallo said the restaurant’s 
working 
title 
is 
“Fort 
Fingerle,” and the goal is to 
bring to life the expansive 
concrete on the lawn by 
making a commons area, as 
well as to include a bar area 
on the second floor that leads 
out to a “groovy, charming” 
rooftop.
“We’ll have a little portion 
of it dedicated to carry-out 
and dedicated to grab-and-
go,” Catallo said. “Between 
that element, the rooftop, the 

restaurant, and then the way we 
activate the sheds, it’s just going 
to be something that you don’t 
find anywhere else because you 
can only do it if you have a little 
micro-campus 
like 
Fingerle 
has.”
Catallo also shut down recent 
rumors about the proposal also 
being for a brewpub.
“We’ve always been able to 
buy better beer than we could 
make and we’ve stuck to that,” 
Catallo said. “It has allowed us 
to focus on scratch-producing all 
of our food and then partnering 
with different brewers that are 
proud of practicing their craft. 
We’ve always been happy to 
support micro-breweries and 
craft breweries and focus on the 
kind of comfort food that we’re 
proud to create. That’s the same 
with what we’ll do at this space.”
All of Union Joints’ projects 
thus far have involved taking an 
old building and repurposing it, 
while still respecting its original 
purpose and structure.
“We’re familiar with Ann 
Arbor, but I don’t know if Ann 
Arbor is necessarily familiar 
with 
Union 
Joints,” 
said 
Catallo. “We’ve been proudly 
repurposing 
buildings 
since 
1995 
and 
practicing 
place-
making in these buildings that 
always served one purpose and 
were destined to serve another. 
And we think that this Fingerle 
Millworks building just checked 
all the boxes.”
Catallo emphasized they are 
not going to change Fingerle’s 
footprint or original purpose 
through 
their 
development. 
Rather, he feels this is an 
opportunity to have something 
old become new again.
Jack 
Ferber, 
a 
Business 
freshman at the University, said 
he appreciates Union Joints’ 
intentions in honoring the lot’s 

VIRTUAL RE ALIT Y: INSIDE A SL AUGHTE RHOUSE

ON THE DAILY: U-M DENTAL TO PROVIDE FREE DENTAL CARE TO CHILDREN

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: U DEVELOPS ANTI -RACISM 
WORKSHOPS

On March 30, the University of 
Michigan School of Dentistry will 
provide free dental care to children 
aged 4 to 18. The annual event, 
Give Kids a Smile Day, seeks to help 
communities that may have trouble 
accessing dental care, such as those 
in low-income communities, those 
without health insurance and those 

with accessibility issues. The event will 
take place at the University’s Dentistry 
School on North University Avenue 
and aims to serve 80 families. 
Dental student Mary Claire Kiernan 
said the event is part of the American 
Dental 
Association 
Foundation’s 
“Give Kids a Smile” initiative. Forty 
people attended the event last year 
and just over 60 children are currently 
registered for this year’s event. 
Kiernan said dental decay is 

widespread among children, worsened 
by obstacles to dental care access. 
“Today, dental decay is the most 
common childhood disease in the US,” 
Kiernan wrote in an email interview 
with The Daily. “To further complicate 
this, there are many barriers to access 
to oral health care. Give Kids a Smile 
Day serves to provide our community 
with the services they need as well 
as offer education and preventative 
care in order to promote lifelong oral 

health.”
According to the Michigan State 
Oral Health Plan, Michigan has a 
percentage of children with excellent 
or very good health higher than the 
national average (76 percent compared 
to 71 percent). Still, the National Survey 
of Children’s Health said 12 percent 
of young children and 11 percent of 
adolescents did not go to the dentist’s 
office for a preventative visit during the 
past year. 

March 26, 1987
A plan to add workshops on 
racism, sexism, and bigotry to the 
freshman summer orientation 
is in the developmental stages, 
according 
to 
Robin 
Jacoby, 
administrative assistant to Vice 
President and Provost James.
“People have been thinking 
about this proposal for a while,but 
a mandate has come in the last few 

weeks,” Jacoby said. “The BAM 
III it and UCAR demands gave a 
further impetus to the proposal.”
The University’s offices of 
housing 
and 
orientation 
are 
responsible for developing the 
programs, 
which 
include 
a 
workshop to be conducted during 
the fall in all residence halls. 
Housing officials could not be 
reached for comment last night. 

The workshops may fulllfill one 
of the United Coalition Against 
Racism’s proposals that demanded 
the establishment of a mandatory 
workshop 
on 
racism. 
UCAR 
members were not involved in 
planning the program.
According to Marty Ellington, 
a UCAR member and LSA senior, 
“UCAR will go over the programs 
and make recommendations to 

the administration.”
UCAR member James McGee, 
a first year medical student, said 
he was unaware of the plan and 
speculated that other UCAR 
members are also unfamiliar with 
it. McGee would not comment on 
this particular plan, but said, “Any 
program that opens students’ 
minds to diversity and encourages 
open discussion is good.”

original use while adapting the 
space.
“I’m a huge fan of keeping 
integrity of buildings and I think 
that’s what this project seems 
to be trying to do,” Ferber said. 
“They’re trying to bring in a new 
age to an old building.”
Catallo said they intend to play 
a part in all of the action in the 
college town.
“Just with the way you can 
come in off of Main Street or 
Madison and whether it’s on 
a Wednesday or your way to a 
game at the Big House, we just 
think that people will use this 
building and this restaurant as 
they see fit,” Catallo said.
Ferber said he believes the 
new restaurant will do well by 
getting involved in student life.
“I think it’s a very, very cool 
idea that they’re keeping the 
building intact and they’re trying 
to get involved more with the 
University and the student body 
by making it a part of game day 
or a part of student life at night,” 

Ferber said. “I think it’s going to 
be financially successful because 
it seems to be in a good spot, 
and kids are always looking for 
meals outside of things they cook 
themselves or dining hall food.”
Business freshman Maggie 
Dahlmann said she believes 
this establishment will enhance 
the city and the University’s 
popularity and culture.
“I think it will have a really 
positive impact on the city, as 
restaurant culture is ingrained 
in Ann Arbor,” Dahlmann said. 
“Unique 
brands 
encourage 
tourism, which would make U 
of M an even more attractive 
university.”
Catallo said he is excited to 
share updates as his project 
progresses, such as what they’ve 
“got cooking menu-wise” and 
with the space.
“It’s been a while since the 
saws in there were milling trim,” 
Catallo said. “And now we’ll be 
milling food for people to enjoy, 
hopefully.”

Similarly, 
a 
report 
by 
the College of Engineering 
showed that across bachelor’s, 
master’s 
and 
doctoral 
programs at the University, 
women comprised less than 30 
percent of degree recipients in 
the 2016-2017 school year.
However, 
the 
professors’ 
study also shows that even 
though the applicant pool for 
IA positions averaged about 
16.5 percent female, women 
tended to score about nine 
percent higher than men. As a 
result, women filled 56 percent 
of the IA spots. 
According to James Juett, an 
author of the study and EECS 
lecturer, the professors did not 
take gender into account when 
hiring IAs for EECS courses. 
Juett said the department’s 
focus 
on 
alternative 
methods of evaluation, like 
interviews and video teaching 
demonstrations, was one factor 
that led to a more gender-
balanced class of IAs.
“We found that the staff 
that we hired were much more 
balanced in terms of gender 
than if we had hired based on 
GPA or previous grades the 
student earned in the course,” 
Juett said. “If you hire based 
on those metrics, then you 
end up with a gender balance 
on your staff which is pretty 
much exactly the same as the 
balance in the overall student 
population. 
So 
through 
a 
process that is not just based on 
numbers on paper but is based 
on people actually coming 
in for in-person interviews, 
submitting 
teaching 
demonstrations, et cetera, this 
leads to a more gender diverse 
staff.”
Amir Kamil, chief author of 
the study and EECS lecturer, 
said 
seeing 
diversity 
and 
representation in his classes 

as an undergraduate at the 
University 
of 
California, 
Berkeley made him feel more 
confident 
about 
pursuing 
computer science. He said 
although the University of 
Michigan professors involved 
in the hiring process did not 
intentionally create a cohort 
that was diverse in terms of 
race and gender, they naturally 
achieved a gender balance that 
may be beneficial for students 
who are wary of entering the 
field.
In the past few years, the 
University 
has 
taken 
steps 
to recruit more women to 
computer science in an effort 
to diversify the population 
of CS majors. In 2016, a team 
of doctoral students founded 
CS 
KickStart 
to 
introduce 
incoming 
freshman 
women 
to 
basic 
principles 
of 
CS. 
Beginning in fall 2018, the 
CS Department also ran a 
one-credit course, EECS 198: 
Discover 
Computer 
Science, 
aimed at freshman women 
with no formal experience 
in programming. Even with 
these programs, women remain 
a minority in almost all CS 
classes.
Nonetheless, 
Engineering 
senior 
Amy 
Baer, 
an 
instructional aide for EECS 
183, said she rarely experiences 
sexism or issues with professors 
or students in her classes at 
the University. Instead, Baer 
said there is a general sense of 
fear and intimidation that goes 
along with majoring in a field 
that is male-dominated.
“The intimidation factor of 
women moving on is a huge 
part of it, when women are so 
aware that they’re among the 
minority and are thinking, ‘Oh, 
I’m abnormal, I’m not supposed 
to be here,’ makes them not 
want to continue,” Baer said. 
“It’s a circular reasoning type of 
thing, where there are not a lot 
of women in computer science 
so some of the women joining 

computer science see that, and 
then not join computer science. 
I 
think 
that’s 
the 
biggest 
problem, it’s intimidation and 
not seeing that there are other 
women.”
Similarly, 
Engineering 
sophomore Bella Gribov noted 
how imposter syndrome, or 
the feeling that you have not 
fully 
earned 
your 
success, 
is 
common 
among 
women 
in CS and is something she 
occasionally struggles with as a 
woman and a CS major. Gribov 
said the professors and IAs in 
lower level CS classes discuss 

imposter syndrome in some of 
their first lectures to reassure 
students that they can succeed.
“I think that a lot of the time, 

I would think I wasn’t good 
enough because I’m a girl and I 
didn’t see a lot of girls around 
me, and not because of things 
other people said or did,” 
Gribov said. “... A lot of girls 
do drop out of the major just 
because they feel like, ‘There 
aren’t a lot of girls around me, 
this isn’t for me,’ when that’s 
not true.”
Juett 
acknowledged 
that 
his study did not explicitly 
address why women performed 
better 
in 
the 
application 
process. However, Juett said 
it is possible there was some 
degree of self-selection among 
applicants, meaning only the 
most qualified women in CS 
sent in applications for IA 
positions.
“We know that women tend 
to experience some barriers 
in computer science because 
of 
the 
culture 
that 
men 
don’t,” Juett said. “Studies 
have found that that can lead 
to 
lower 
confidence. 
One 
possible explanation is that 
the women who applied were 
those that were exceptionally 
qualified. 
That’s 
both 
encouraging, because we do 
have several qualified women 
candidates, 
and 
it’s 
also 
discouraging because if that’s 
the explanation, then it means 
that there are people who 
aren’t applying who should be 
applying.”
Baer, who has some say in 
the application process due to 
her position as an IA, said the 
study revealed how women 
are equally qualified to occupy 
IA positions even though they 
remain a minority in CS classes 
at the University.
“We 
can 
hire 
an 
equal 
amount of men and women 
and hire the best people still,” 
Baer said. “I think there’s this 
misconception that if you’re 
hiring more women, it means 
that 
you’re 
hiring 
worse 
candidates. I think the study 
shows that this is not true.”

The first activity, a budgeting 
simulation, had attendees disperse 
limited resources to various living 
categories such as housing and 
health care. The second activity, 
an 
online 
simulation 
called 
SPENT, prompted attendees to 
make day-by-day financial choices 
for a full month. Each day, a new 
scenario was presented, forcing 
participants to make difficult 
choices.
According 
to 
Vargas, 
the 
simulations 
allowed 
students 
to invest in their choices and 
experience the consequences or 
rewards of their actions while 
keeping their societal privilege in 
mind.
“The 
first 
simulation 
was 
straightforward, 
there 
wasn’t 
really any consequences that 

came with it, people were very 
idealistic,” Vargas said. “I think 
that happens when people are 
not really aware or in tune with 
those experiences so they don’t 
know the consequences that 
happen. The second simulation 
gave us more of that experience 
where we’re now facing the 
consequences 
and 
limitations 
that come with our actions and 
identities.”
LSA sophomore Camilla Cantu, 
a Chi Upsilon Sigma member, 
helped facilitate the discussion 
and said the simulations fostered 
self-realization through difficult 
decisions.
“I think it’s really hard to brush 
off our own privileges,” Cantu 
said. “But I think when people 
are forced into that mindset and 
forced into a perspective that 
shows them their daily privileges 
and lack of privileges from other 

people, they think, ‘Wow, this is 
actually kind of a struggle.’ I think 
the simulations and the game 
is kind of necessary for people 
to gain the perspective for the 
privileges they may or may not 
have.”
Engineering freshman Yanella 
Lopez said the event exposed her 
to different ways of thinking 
about her life and privilege.
“It was an interesting take 
on our daily lives and how 
we perceive certain events 
and situations we’re placed 
in,” Lopez said. “There’s a lot 
of things that, one, we don’t 
really think about, and two, 
we don’t really have a lot of 
control over, like what race 
or class we are born in, the 
amount of money we have and 
things of that nature. I really 
enjoyed talking about that and 
hearing other perspectives.”

Vargas 
said 
he 
hopes 
to 
continue 
similar 
conversations 
by 
hearing 
perspectives 
on 
privilege 
from other groups who come 
from a different social and 
economic background.
“I think in this room, we 
shared a lot of identities that 
are historically marginalized, 
disenfranchised,” 
Vargas 
said. “It was a very interesting 
space, because I am a student 
at the University, I am first 
gen, I can realize a lot of 
these privileges and I think 
it 
was 
a 
very 
important 
space to have where we can 
have these straightforward 
conversations 
about 
what 
are 
these 
privileges 
that 
come 
with 
socioeconomic 
status and intersectionality 
with gender and other social 
identities.”

One of the group’s constraints is 
they need Apple laptops in order for 
it to become an iOS app, which none 
of the group members currently 
have. In addition, they expressed 
they do not have the resources to 
spread awareness for the app if it 
does end up being developed, which 
is why they came to CSG.
“We know that one of our 
limitations is just our platform, 
and this is why we’re here to come 
present in front of CSG,” Toure said. 
“We know that CSG has the access 
to possibly send out emails to future 
freshmen that could be coming in, 
and we feel that this is the most 
effective way of getting this app 
across.”
CSG Treasurer Niccolo Beltramo, 
an LSA senior, questioned how the 
group plans on ensuring first-year 
students do not take advantage of 
the app and engage in inappropriate 
dialogue and activity. 
“My number one concern when 
thinking about a large-scale social 
networking app is what messaging 
is going to look like,” Beltramo said. 
“I was wondering if you had thought 
about what form content moderation 
might take on the platform if there is 
harassment or what have you?” 
In order to prevent this type of 
behavior from occurring, the group 
explained they could filter out 
certain vulgar words. In addition, 
they said they could develop a strike 
system, in which users’ accounts 
would be disabled after a certain 
number of reports by other users.
Later 
in 
the 
meeting, 
the 

assembly voted to adopt the Ethics 
Committee’s report on an ethics 
investigation involving Greene. The 
report found no evidence of unethical 
behavior on Green’s part. At the CSG 
meeting on Feb.12, Engineering 
junior Zeke Majeske, chair of the 
Executive Nominations Committee, 
brought up his concerns on the 
ethics behind Greene’s process for 
approving the position of chief of 
staff. Majeske pursued an ethics 
investigation against Greene. 
Concerns 
surrounded 
the 
executive 
branch’s 
varying 
interpretations of the word “may,” 
specifically in regard to the 
nominations process. 
After deliberation, the Ethics 
Committee ruled that at the time 
of the event, Greene proposed an 
interpretation of the word “may,” 
and, CSG Speaker Austin Glass, a 
Rackham student, did not object 
because he believed that doing 
so would, “irreparably damage 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
Executives and the Assembly, 
given the partisan tensions and 
volatility present in CSG right 
after the election.” The committee 
also ruled that at the moment, the 
executive interpretation of the 
word “shall” meaning “may” was 
in the best interest of the situation 
at hand. 

Furthermore, 
Majeske 

brought up that Greene’s initial 
interpretation of the word should 
have set precedent for later the 
interpretations in the case of 
the approval of chief of staff.

AWARDS
From Page 1A

The 
Nominations 
Committee, 
which 
determined 
the 
award 
winners, is comprised of 
nine members of campus 
life professional staff and 
undergraduate 
students. 
Some 
representatives 
included 
individuals 
from 
MLEAD, Graduate Student 
Employees 
for 
Fraternity 
& Sorority Life, Housing, 
Recreational 
Sports 
and 
the 
Center 
for 
Campus 
Involvement.
LSA 
sophomore 
Evie 
Winter, 
Nominations 
Committee 
member 
for 
MDSLA and chief of staff of 
Central Student Government, 
said this ceremony aims to 
recognize individuals and 
groups on campus who are 
not typically acknowledged.
“I think that a lot of groups 
that are nominated and win 
tonight are student groups 
who make really meaningful 
impacts on campus but often 
don’t get the recognition for 
it,” Winter said.
Winter said groups like 
CSG are often more talked 
about campus, as opposed 
to other organizations on 
campus that also have impact 
on campus issues.
“For 
example, 
student 
government gets a lot of clout, 
but you know we’re really 
visible and some of these 
other 
organizations 
don’t 

necessarily have the same 
kind of name recognition 
on campus,” Winter said. “I 
think by recognizing a lot 
of these organizations and 
individuals it reinforces the 
idea that, you know, everyone 
has a place on this campus 
and a lot of people are doing 
good work even though it’s 
not often recognized the way 
it should be.”
University President Mark 
Schlissel 
and 
E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 
president 
for student life, attended 
the 
event. 
Harper 
said 
the 
ceremony 
represents 
members of the University 
community supporting each 
other.
“Being 
a 
part 
of 
a 
strong 
community 
means 
celebrating and recognizing 
the 
accomplishments 
of 
others,” Harper said.
Harper said the awards are 
not about winning, but about 
recognizing the outstanding 
students 
working 
toward 
social 
change 
in 
the 
community.
“It’s an award ceremony, 
but really that’s not what 
this is all about. It’s about 
hard work, the prospect of 
creating positive change in 
the world.”
Harper 
acknowledged 
some 
individuals 
in 
the 
audience such as Meaghan 
Wheat, the recipient of the 
Social Change Award who 
worked with the Women’s 
Studies 
Department 
to 
create a new minor focused 

on social class and inequality 
that will be offered in the fall 
of 2019.
Public 
Health 
senior 
Amani Echols was awarded 
Senior of the Year. Echols 
is in the top 5 percent of 
her class in the School of 
Public Health, and program 
coordinator of Dial-a-Doula 
program, 
which 
connects 
women giving birth in the 
hospital to Doula services. In 
addition, she co-created and 
co-chaired the Health Equity 
High School Summit, which 
brings about 100 students to 
the Public Health School to 
teach about public health, 
and is on the Ginsberg Center 
Student Advisory Board for 
service and learning.
Echols said she usually 
doesn’t speak publicly about 
her work, and she appreciates 
receiving the recognition.
“The 
award 
means 
recognition for the work 
that I’m doing,” Echols said. 
“Because as people have 
mentioned, I don’t like to 
speak about what I’m doing. 
It’s not something I think 
about, it’s just I’m doing it 
because I’m passionate about 
it, it’s something that I want 
to do. So it’s nice that I have 
friends that are willing to 
nominate me and notice all 
the hours that I’m putting 
into 
my 
extracurriculars 
outside of school.”
The First Year Student of 
the Year Award was awarded 
to Aya Fattah, Sophomore of 
the Year Award went to Brett 

Zaslavsky, Junior of the Year 
Award was given to Olivia 
Livernois 
and 
Graduate 
Student of the Year was 
Kevin Lieberman.
Many 
organizations 
were 
acknowledged 
for 
international 
work. 
The 
student 
organization 
Blueprints for Pangea was 
awarded the Global Impact 
Award for their work to 
alleviate 
global 
health 
disparities by distributing 
unused 
medical 
supplies 
from U.S. hospitals to people 
in need overseas.
The 
LGBTQ 
Survivor 
Peer Led Support Group 
was given the Social Justice 
Award and The Dot Org won 
the Innovation or Research 
Award for their commitment 
to 
raising 
awareness 
of 
menstruation-based 
health 
disparities 
and 
providing 
people experiencing poverty 
with 
menstrual 
hygiene 
products.
Winter 
emphasized 
the 
award ceremony’s intention 
of honoring the work of 
those on campus who are 
underrecognized. 
“We 
just 
recognize 
there are a lot of student 
groups and individuals on 
campus who might not be 
recognized in other ways, so 
we just wanna take a night 
to really recognize their 
accomplishments and thank 
them for everything they’ve 
done for campus.”

“This is a description of 
multiple incidents of clear and 
unadulterated negligence that 
must be punished,” Budkie 
wrote. “The staff involved in 
these incidents should never be 
allowed to work with animals 
again.”
LSA 
freshman 
Josh 
Goettner works with mice 
in a lab at the North Campus 
Research 
Complex 
through 
the Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity 
Program. 
Goettner 
condemned 
the 
animal life negligence in these 
labs, but said he maintains 
his support of animal testing 
for its potential benefits in 
improving human care.
“I didn’t really know all 
this was going on in other 
labs,” Goettner said. “After 
finding out about the incident, 
I think that accidents that 
kill animals on such large 
scales should not be allowed 
to happen. However, I fully 
support animal testing just 
because I value human lives 
so much more. If all goes well, 
my research project will help 
tens of thousands of people 
with type 2 diabetes, and to me 
that’s worth some mice.”
LSA 
freshman 
Sydney 
Musser also works in a UROP 
lab in the Department of 
Human Genetics and said she 
had to go through extensive 
training consisting of online 
courses, 
in-person 
training 
classes and a tour of the mouse 
room in order to be authorized 
to work with the mice in her 
lab.
“This was a long process 
that I had to go through and 
I believe Michigan does a 
good job of making sure those 
wanting to work with mice 
or other animals in research 
are qualified,” Musser said. 
“I also learned about how 
much the animal husbandry 
monitors the animals and how 
communication between the 
animal husbandry and the lab is 
extremely important. Because 
of this, I can understand how 
mistakes 
could 
happen 
if 
there is a miscommunication 
between the animal husbandry 
and the laboratory staff. It 
is unfortunate that mistakes 
led to the deaths of so many 
animals.”
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
wrote 
the 
University took all necessary 
steps to self-report and correct 
these isolated incidents, and 
corrective action plans were 
put 
into 
place 
to 
prevent 
any similar incidents from 
occurring in the future.
“The University has many 
strong policies and controls in 
place to monitor all projects 
involving the use of animals,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. 

Fitzgerald 
wrote 
the 
University 
will 
continue 
to refine their practices to 
maintain their commitment to 
achieve and exceed national 
and professional standards in 
animal care and use.
“The University of Michigan 
recognizes that working with 
animals to advance human and 
animal health is a privilege that 
requires constant diligence and 
a commitment to the highest 
standards of animal welfare in 
all aspects of our research and 
teaching,” Fitzgerald wrote. 
“We deeply regret the loss of 
these animals, most of which 
were zebrafish.”
 
On The Daily: UM Dentistry 
School to provide free dental 
care to children aged 4-18
On March 30, the University 
of 
Michigan 
School 
of 
Dentistry will provide free 
dental care to children aged 4 
to 18. The annual event, Give 
Kids a Smile Day, seeks to help 
communities that may have 
trouble accessing dental care, 
such as those in low-income 
communities, those without 
health insurance and those 
with accessibility issues. The 
event will take place at the 
University’s Dentistry School 
on North University Avenue 
and aims to serve 80 families. 
Dental student Mary Claire 
Kiernan said the event is 
part of the American Dental 
Association Foundation’s “Give 
Kids a Smile” initiative. Forty 
people attended the event last 
year and just over 60 children 
are currently registered for 
this year’s event. 
Kiernan said dental decay is 
widespread among children, 
worsened 
by 
obstacles 
to 
dental care access. 
“Today, 
dental 
decay 
is 
the most common childhood 
disease in the US,” Kiernan 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Daily. “To further 
complicate 
this, 
there 
are 
many barriers to access to oral 
health care. Give Kids a Smile 
Day serves to provide our 
community with the services 
they need as well as offer 
education 
and 
preventative 
care 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
lifelong oral health.”
According to the Michigan 
State 
Oral 
Health 
Plan, 
Michigan has a percentage of 
children with excellent or very 
good health higher than the 
national average (76 percent 
compared 
to 
71 
percent). 
Still, 
the 
National 
Survey 
of Children’s Health said 12 
percent of young children and 
11 percent of adolescents did 
not go to the dentist’s office for 
a preventative visit during the 
past year. Additionally, Count 
Your Smiles, a basic screening 
survey, said that 55.9 percent 
of 
Michigan 
third 
graders 
experienced tooth decay in 
2010.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

We are mistrustful of 
CSG campaigns that make 
sweeping, 
underdeveloped 
promises for a number of 
reasons. For example, though 
MVision’s 
candidates 
won 
the 
executive 
seats 
last 
year, their campaign with 
platform planks is no longer 
available online. This makes 
it difficult to hold the newly 
elected leaders accountable 
for 
the 
various 
promises 
made to students. The year 
before, we saw negligent 
initiatives yield a Campus 
Affordability Guide that was 
out of touch with the needs of 
lower-income students.
Furthermore, the Engage 
Michigan Party, and their 
platform planks, resemble a 
generic, mixed bag of half-
baked ideas harvested from 
previous 
CSG 
campaigns. 
We do not see how Engage 
Michigan will act differently 
when its policies are both 
tepid and underdeveloped. 
For 
example, 
when 
discussing 
affordability, 
they 
advocate 
providing 
access to public microwaves 
on campus. While this may 
save students from buying 
food by allowing them to 
bring their own, this doesn’t 
address the more pressing 
issue of food insecurity. The 
burden of proving whether or 
not this policy would effect 
change ultimately falls on 
their shoulders, and they 
have yet to substantiate the 
claim that increasing access 
to microwaves is a legitimate 
means to solve the problem 
of food insecurity that is 
endemic to many students 
across campus.
The weak and indirect 
plan 
to 
address 
food 

insecurity identified above 
is found in the campaign’s 
“Accessibility 
and 
Affordability” (or, as they 
called it on their website, 
“accessability”) unit, while 
similarly inadequate plans 
are made across each sector 
of their campaign. In terms 
of “Sustainability,” Engage 
Michigan refers to building a 
five-year sustainability plan, 
stating that they will “work 
with university officers and 
student 
organizations 
to 
build a plan that addresses 
the specific needs of the 
university and lays out clear 
and concise action items.” Yet, 
Engage 
Michigan 
chooses 
to 
not 
establish 
specific 
changes 
the 
University 
should make to become more 
environmentally 
conscious, 
opting 
instead 
to 
simply 
acknowledge 
that 
there 
should be a discussion.

While 
we 
admire 
the 
spirit 
and 
authenticity 
of Argha’s campaign, we 
don’t see how he can truly 
implement his policy goals 
without a proper slate of 
representatives. 
Moreover, 
though we appreciate the 
light-hearted and personable 
elements of the campaign, 
we want students on campus 

to vote for candidates who 
warrant respect and exhibit 
professionalism 
in 
their 
campaign and their role. 
So instead of endorsing 
a candidate, we want to 
highlight 
the 
bodies 
on 
campus 
doing 
diligent 
work to promote positive 
change. For example, the 
Climate Action Movement 
has been tenacious in their 
efforts to demand a meeting 
with 
University 
leaders, 
risking arrest for carbon 
neutrality by 2030. Or the 
Prison Creative Arts Project, 
known as PCAP, which is 
currently 
hosting 
one 
of 
the largest exhibitions of 
art by incarcerated people 
in 
the 
country 
on 
our 
campus and has provided 
artistic resources to those 
locked 
in 
the 
criminal 
justice system. Or Music 
Matters. Or HeForShe. Or 
any of the other countless 
organizations 
making 
a 
valiant push to impact our 
University.
This is not to diminish 
the work of CSG, whose 
members are undoubtedly 
intent on having a positive 
influence 
on 
campus, 
which we’ve seen much of 
this year. For example, in 
September they passed their 
Buses to Ballots resolution 
encouraging 
students 
to 
vote. However, because the 
entire campus is allowed 
to vote for CSG’s leaders, it 
elevates 
their 
importance 
above other equally or more 
effective 
organizations. 
While we don’t discourage 
students from voting this 
week, we hope they see 
CSG for what it is: another 
student organization.

DYLAN BERGER | COLUMN

Why we are losing the struggle against hate
W 
 

ith last week’s heinous 
terrorist 
attack 
on 
two 
mosques 
in 
Christchurch, New Zealand, the 
menace of white supremacy has 
once again reared its ugly head. 
The terrorist, who ought to be 
rendered nameless, gunned down 
50 worshipers in cold blood at the 
Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood 
Islamic Centre on the basis of racial 
and religious hatred. The attack in 
Christchurch represents the surging 
threat of white supremacy and other 
hate-filled movements worldwide, 
including here in the United States.
However, the conversation around 
this tragedy has been hijacked by 
politicians seeking to use this grave 
threat to score cheap political points 
on their opponents. For example, 
some have even tried to blame 
President Donald Trump for the 
horrific attack in Christchurch, 
despite his condemnation of the 
attack. The end result of this shallow 
discourse is more division within 
our society while hatred continues 
to grow unencumbered. In the wake 
of this frightening threat, we must 
instead unite to combat hate with 
strengthened communities.
Fortunately, we the American 
people have far more power to purge 
our society of hate than our elected 
representatives do. Our founding 
fathers envisioned a nation of 
minutemen, with patriotic Americans 
taking action to better our society. 
Lately, however, our civic engagement 
hasn’t lived up to the legacy of our 
exceptional nation. By becoming 
more engaged in our individual 
communities, we have the capacity to 
rejuvenate American civic life from 
the ground-up. In doing so, we will 
ensure that no one continues to be 
left to fall through the cracks and turn 
towards hate.
To defeat the rising threat of white 
supremacy, we must reject the divisive 
rhetoric of our leaders and return to 
our tradition stretching back from the 
Revolutionary War to World War II 
of banding together to effect change 
from the grassroots level. A more 
cohesive society and vibrant civic 
life will allow for the light of joining 
together for a common purpose to 
drown out the darkness of hateful 

movements.
The increasing digitalization of 
our society has allowed us to connect 
with friends and family across the 
world while, paradoxically, making it 
that much more difficult to connect 
with those closest to us. For example, 
a 2016 study involving more than 1,700 
people found an increase in risk of 
depression and anxiety among people 
who used a large number of social 
media platforms. In addition to that, 
another 2014 study found people who 
browsed Facebook for 20 minutes 
reported a more negative mood than 
those who had just browsed the 
internet. While there’s also plenty of 
evidence to show social media as a 
positive force, it’s clear there are strong 
negative behavioral effects as well.
With the combination of social 
media’s negative effects with a 
meltdown of the social fabric in 
areas left behind by economic 
globalization, we see a growing 
population disgruntled and without 
a community to which they can turn. 
Proponents of all kinds of hate — from 
white supremacy to radical Islamic 
extremism — have taken advantage of 
this situation to bring in new recruits, 
who are typically disaffected young 
men. As savvy online operators, 
peddlers of hate radicalize their 
socially isolated prey remotely through 
the internet. Unlike more traditional 
national security threats, digital 
radicalization is especially dangerous 
because it has no discernible face and 
can enter millions of American homes 
undetected.
Twisted souls finally find the 
meaning and belonging they are 
craving in hate groups. Explaining 
this phenomenon, Jessica Stern, 
a research professor at Boston 
University’s Pardee School of Global 
Studies and co-author of “ISIS: 
The State of Terror,” said in an 
interview to CNN Business last week, 
“They’re picking up an ideology that 
helps them justify their rage, their 
disappointment, and it’s something 
available.” As Stern illustrated, the 
proliferation of white supremacy and 
other forms of hate is rooted in the 
lack of a greater sense of common 
purpose among a portion of the 
population. In joining a hate group, 
these predators finally receive the 

attention they are craving, even if it is 
negative.
The lack of belonging felt by white 
supremacists in mainstream societies 
breeds envy toward communities 
that embody the common meaning 
and purpose they never had. 
Tragically, this envy engenders the 
reprehensible acts of hate dominating 
our headlines all too often as of late. 
While we’re still learning more about 
what motivated the Christchurch 
terrorist, it’s clear the rottenness of 
envy afflicted him deeply. He even 
admitted in his 74-page manifesto 
of hatred that he wasn’t originally 
planning to attack New Zealand, 
but later chose to do so because of 
its status as a beacon for peaceful 
multiculturalism. 
The 
terrorist 
went on to state that his ultimate 
goal was to ignite an American race 
war, shattering the thriving sense of 
community of which he is so envious. 
Instead of acquiescing to terror, 
we must double down on our efforts 
to build a more cohesive society. 
Pillars of our society, such as houses 
of worship and recreational sports 
leagues, serve as a bulwark against 
hate. They provide a forceful 
alternative to the movements of 
hate currently reaching so many of 
our disaffected and socially isolated 
neighbors. By continuing to build up 
our cornerstones of community, we 
will provide those so removed from 
society with a way out from the lure 
of turning to hate. In fact, analysis of 
our current at-risk programs shows 
that youth all across America are 
becoming more productive members 
of society because of these programs. 
In lieu of finding belonging in a 
movement of hate, they can find 
belonging by connecting with others. 
Working together for something 
positive will, ultimately, prove far 
more powerful than the movements 
of hate currently ravaging our society. 
We must first, however, rededicate 
ourselves to working together to 
build up the infrastructure that 
allows cornerstones of community to 
reach out to at-risk youth.

FROM THE DAILY

On CSG and student orgs

V

oting for Central Student Government candidates opens Wednesday 
after a quietly held debate last week. The candidates include 
presidential hopeful Ben Gerstein and vice-presidential candidate 
Isabelle Blanchard of the Engage Michigan Party. They face Shub Argha, 
who is running for president without a party. Though the candidates all 
ran and debated a slew of issues, and we encourage students to vote for 
whomever they view as most capable for the position, this year, the editorial 
board has decided not to endorse a candidate.

J 

was napping on a couch in 
East Quad when he was 
approached by a University 
of Michigan police officer and 
asked to leave. The officer and 
the residential staff thought that 
he was experiencing homelessness 
because of the way he was dressed. 
J is financially independent from his 
family and attending school with the 
aid of scholarships. He was growing 
out a beard. J is Indian-American.
M was hammocking over the 
summer on Packard Street when 
officers took down her license 
number because she was not 
supposed to hammock on University 
property, despite being off-campus 
and despite the numerous hammocks 
in the Diag at the time. When she was 
called into a disciplinary hearing, she 
was asked how she could make up for 
the harmful impact of her actions. M 
is Arab-American.
L was working out in the 
University gym over the summer 
when officers arrested him. He was 
a freshman, and had just finished 
his spring term classes, so he would 
not be enrolled again (and hence, 
eligible to use the gym) until that 
September. He was cuffed, escorted 
across campus and kicked out of the 
University for breaking and entering. 
He later lost a job offer with the NFL 
due to this incident. L is African-
American.
Is this what safety on campus 
looks like? The incidents described 
above are (relatively) minor. They 
did not result in felony charges, but 
they do illustrate the targeted and 
non-random nature of policing in 
our community. When events like 
these pose a risk to students’ or 
staff’s place at the University, the 
role and purpose of the University’s 
involvement in its students’ and 
staffs’ lives must be reexamined.
The University’s new policy, the 
“Required Disclosure of Felony 
Charges and/or Felony Convictions”, 
requires 
faculty, 
staff, 
student 
employees, volunteers and visiting 
scholars 
who 
find 
themselves 
convicted of a felony, and even those 
merely charged but not convicted, to 
report it to the University within one 
week.
The University of Michigan 
already requires all prospective 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
students, faculty members and 
staff employees to disclose any 

previous criminal record during 
the admissions or employment 
application process, a procedure that 
has been increasingly abandoned by 
other educational institutions due 
to a lack of evidence that it ensures 
safety. When the University imposed 
the self-disclosure felony policy 
this winter, it added one more layer 
to the web of ways in which the 
University ingratiates itself with 
the criminal justice system. As an 
educational institution, is it outside 
both the University’s responsibilities 
and qualifications to be taking on 
the role of jury or judge in criminal 
proceedings. The Board of Regents 
and the University at large should be 
presuming our innocence, not our 
guilt.
I am part of Umich Behind 
Bars, a student-led movement in 
collaboration and solidarity with 
staff, community organizations and 
other movements on campus toward 
a more comprehensive program for 
diversity, equity and inclusion. We’re 
calling for the University to rescind 
the felony disclosure policy, Ban 
the Box, and eliminate background 
checks. More than 1,800 students, 
staff and community stakeholders 
have signed onto the policy changes 
we support, outlined in the Carceral 
State Project’s open letter.
In the years that my fellow 
organizers and I have been at the 
University, we’ve seen the regents 
and other officials act on their best 
intentions and create successful, 
productive spaces for dialogue 
and healing, practices that protect 
students at critical times, and widely 
successful educational campaigns, 
such as those on safe drinking. We 
know that good can come from a 
critically well-thought-out policy 
and/or 
University 
action. 
The 
University is, after all, “Committed 
to a policy of equal opportunity for 
all persons and does not discriminate 
on the basis of race, color, national 
origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, gender 
expression, 
disability, 
religion, 
height, weight, or veteran status in 
employment, educational programs 
and activities, and admissions.”
I believe that the felony self-
disclosure policy did come from 
this same set of intentions and was 
created out of this same concern 
for students’ safety on campus. No 
University 
community 
member 

should feel at risk, and those who 
actively undermine that and harm 
the community should not be allowed 
to continue doing so. However, 
police and prosecutorial discretion 
leaves people who are charged 
with felonies, which could include 
a wide range of severity, at risk of 
inequitable charge and conviction 
practices. The impact of the felony 
self-disclosure policy will have vast 
and disproportionate consequences 
for certain communities, preventing 
them from entering or staying at 
the University, while providing no 
prevention of harm or assurance of 
students’ safety.
This policy, while coming from 
a good place, is only going to make 
staff and students who are already 
particularly vulnerable feel that they 
don’t belong, will not be supported in 
the face of adversity, or should leave 
before something happens. Where 
students are facing police action 
for nonviolent protest over climate 
change action, and where students 
practically expect danger at a vigil 
for Muslim victims of violence, the 
University’s duty to protect should 
take the form of mitigating, rather 
than exacerbating, the effects of over-
policing and surveillance of students. 
This starts with rescinding carceral 
policies like the felony disclosure 
policy, which continues to punish 
our communities for their unwitting 
interactions with the criminal justice 
system. It starts there, and ends with 
listening, learning and healing as a 
community.

University has work to do to move 
forward alongside a changing world

Wednesday, March 27, 2019 — 5A

What’s louder — the music or the 
man? The more appropriate question 
in today’s digital age would be: 
What’s louder, the music or the media 
surrounding the musician?
There is no lack of dialogue when 
it comes to the increasingly scary 
power media holds to dictate what 
we listen to — consistently, Buzzfeed 
articles are titled something along 
the lines of “How Social Media 
Has Changed The Music Industry.” 
The discourse is even more present 
around buzzwords like “DIY artist.” 
What’s more interesting, however, 
is the development in the last couple 
of years, wherein an artist’s media 
presence has become quintessential. 
It’s an age when listeners do not just 
subscribe to the music; they subscribe 
to the media representation of the 
art simultaneously or before they 
subscribe to the sound. Yes, it’s a long-
standing trend — a band like KISS 
isn’t just a sound, it’s a phenomenon. 
However, looking at 2019 thus far 
and looking towards the future of 
music, listeners are not even aware 
of the subconscious associations 
and characterizations that develop 
the full image of an artist’s sound 
based on the content we interact 
with — when you listen to a song on 
Spotify you are not listening solely 
to the song, but rather the implied 
characterizations of the sound based 
on the media we subscribe to. Even 
scarier is the fact that the artists we 
react to only reach our ears because 
media launched that person or group.
Today, media dominates every 
aspect of the human experience, so 
much so that almost every emerging 
artist only breaks through when 
accompanied with viral YouTube 
videos, an impressive twitter or 
Instagram, a Hollywood presence, 
or something along those lines. 
It is almost impossible to launch 
yourself as an artist unless you have 
accompanying media that creates 
a distinct vibe around your work. 
The examples are endless: Clairo 
establishes herself as queen of teenage 
nostalgia with 29 million views on 
her hit YouTube video “Pretty Girl.” 
The crowds go apeshit over Maggie 
Rogers when a video of a master class 
with Pharrell Williams goes viral. 
Artists like Troye Sivan and Conan 
Gray each had fully established 

aesthetic, lifestyle YouTube channels 
with millions of subscribers before 
launching into the music scene.
Most notably, the band Half 
Alive had practically no listens 
until the launch of their beautifully 
coordinated “Still Feel” music video. 
Half Alive is a perfect example of 
the idea that the media experience 
of music is absolutely essential to 
listening power. No longer does 
the music come first, which is then 
supported 
by 
interviews, 
“Tiny 
Desk” 
performances 
and 
social 
media that promotes the band and 
establishes viewer connection. Now, 
the media comes first. A viewer 
clicks on a “recommended” post or 
video, and they love the sound, yes, 
but there’s a space in the back of 
their brains that becomes obsessed 
and connected with the media (the 
beautiful appearance, the swaggy 
persona, etc.) I like to call it “The 
Mesh.” It’s an interlaced structure of 
appearance, dancing, lighting, vibe, 
the mannerisms and the slang. Yes, 
the sound is a part of this mesh, but 
it’s not necessarily the leading aspect.
This idea of the “mesh” that 
lies in our subconscious came to 
the forefront of my brain when 
listening to a new favorite band of 
mine, Wallows. I found the band 
through Netflix. The lead singer 
of Wallows is Dylan Minette, who 
stars in hit Netflix series “13 Reasons 
Why” as Clay Jensen. Even if you 
haven’t watched “13 Reasons Why,” 
there’s a high chance you’ve seen 
the face: He’s the center of multiple 
memes on twitter, Reddit threads 
and even recognizable for his early 
appearances on shows like “Drake 
& Josh,” “Lost” and “Scandal.” This 
led to a personal investigation of 
Wallows’s rise to fame — did they 
gain most of their popularity from 
Dylan’s fame? Most certainly. Are 
they still extremely deserving of that 
recognition? Most certainly. Their 
sound is super cool. 
In almost every interview with 
Wallows, Minette is asked about 
his role in “13 Reasons Why.” 
Specifically, 
Minette 
told 
Paste 
Magazine: “The show that I’m on, 
I’m under a contract on that and stuff 
and that’s something that I got to 
do and that’s cool and whatever but 
just anytime we have we are doing 
this non-stop because it’s what we 
wanna do.” Social media is usually 
made up of at least half self-conscious 
representation. For Minette, he has 
no control over constant comments 

on all forms of Wallows social media 
stating sentiments such as: “Severely 
disappointed their fan base is a bunch 
of 13 Yr. old fan girls who watch 
Thirteen Reasons Why, ruined the 
concert.”
This 
trend 
comes 
from 
a 
longstanding notion in music. When 
you go to a concert and you gain 
face-to-face recognition with the 
artist, you listen much more. For 
me, going to a concert made me feel 
like the artist was mine. The media 
surrounding the artist is that same 
feeling: They become yours when the 
content you receive each day fully 
develops the vibe of who they are.
All of this being said, there is 
a strong counter example: Frank 
Ocean. This is a man whose music 100 
percent comes before the media. He 
is a minimalist in all media aspects, 
yet his music is an inspiration to 
the majority of emerging artists 
today because he’s a musical genius. 
Although Frank’s emergence into 
recognition does not fall into media 
trends or time frame I speak of, 
even he acknowledges media’s role 
in creating dialogue, fully shaping 
how we see artists and how we see 
their music. In a recent interview 
with GQ, he states: “I feel like there 
was dissonance between how I was 
seen by the audience and where I 
was actually … But there’s also the 
idea of dialogue and discourse and 
conversation — like theater where the 
audience can interrupt you versus the 
television.” Frank goes on to explain 
how he feels the way he is seen is 
not even close to correct, and it’s 
still not correct, which went into his 
thought process behind making his 
Instagram public. But he steps into 
the public Instagram scene, because 
media gives you a step towards 
control of developing the idea around 
an artist. Frank is a rare case of a 
music God who doesn’t need any 
source of media to launch his sound, 
but even he recognizes the media 
landscape of establishing how you 
are represented.
Visual press is everything. To 
listeners everywhere: The content 
we view each day is the sound. 
Whether Wallows likes it or not, the 
back of the brain association with 
cutie “Clay Jensen” from Selena 
Gomez-produced “Thirteen Reasons 
Why” is an integral undercurrent 
of Wallows’s sound, and there’s no 
avoiding it. Think about your favorite 
music, and think about what’s behind 
the love of it.

Do we love sound or media?

Alex Honnold is one of the best 
rock climbers in the world. Alex 
Honnold regularly eats directly 
out of the pan using a spatula as a 
spoon. Alex Honnold is a giant, a 
visionary, a profoundly inspiring 
person whose story reminds me 
of all the good human beings are 
capable of. Alex Honnold is a big 
dumb buffoon who downplays 
every insane thing he does to the 
point that fellow climbers call 
him Alex “No Big Deal” Honnold.
The boy has layers.
Some background: Alex is 
having a bit of a moment right 
now. You might have seen him on 
viral YouTube videos, breaking 
down climbing scenes in movie 
based on realism. Or maybe you’ve 
seen his TED Talk. Or maybe you 
saw “Free Solo,” the documentary 
film about his 2017 ropeless ascent 
of Yosemite’s El Capitan Freerider 

route that recently won an Oscar. 
He’s arguably the most visible and 
popular climber in mainstream 
media since Edmund Hillary 
himself.
His free solo of El Cap is one 
of the most singular and mind-
blowing accomplishments I’ve 
seen a single person achieve in 
my lifetime. The wall is nearly 
3000 feet of sheer granite, and 
Freerider is a notoriously difficult 
path to the top (rated 5.13c in 
climbing circles, meaning that 
even with a rope and protective 
equipment, people very rarely ((if 
ever)) manage to climb it without 
falling). It’s hard to put into words 
the magnitude of what it means 
to climb this thing with nothing 
but a chalk bag strapped around 
the waist — when Alex completed 
his climb, a lot of people in the 
climbing community compared 
it to the moon landing. The New 
Yorker put it simply when they 
covered 
the 
event: 
“Another 
passage can be written in the 

annals of human achievement.”
Like 
most 
people 
who 
encounter Alex’s work, I’m pretty 
much endlessly inspired by him. 
His achievements induce awe, 
in the most biblical sense of the 
word. It’s impossible to be clever 
or cynical when confronted with 
the image of a person dangling by 
two fingers 2000 feet above the 
ground, grinning as though there’s 
no place he’d rather be (spoiler: 
there isn’t). Alex Honnold, for 
me, has been a breath of fresh 
air, an antidote to the poison 
that radiates so much media in 
2019. The appeal is simple: He 
found what he loves most in the 
world, and dedicated his life to its 
ruthless and relentless pursuit. 
In the process of living his life 
exactly the way he wanted to, 
he changed a sport forever and 
redefined the boundaries of fear.
In his book, “Alone on the 
Wall,” Alex explains that he 
primarily gets asked two types 
of questions: Why he free solos 

(climbing with absolutely no 
ropes, gear, or aid of any kind), 
and if he’s scared — both of which 
are polite ways of asking if he 
realizes how easily he could die 
at any minute. To respond, he has 
developed a strange but weirdly 
comforting 
math 
surrounding 
risk 
and 
consequence 
over 
the years. In his mind, he’s 
always climbing well within his 
comfortable range of abilities, 
so even though free soloing has 
high consequence (falling and 
dying), the risks for him are low. 
He’s worked methodically over 
15 years of climbing to expand 
the range of experiences within 
which he doesn’t feel fear.
All of this strikes me as a 
convoluted way of saying that 
he’s reached a level of excellence 
in 
skill 
that 
makes 
failure 
increasingly less likely. You could 
take that as a certain modicum 
of arrogance — and you probably 
should — but it’s an arrogance that 
works for him and that’s allowed 
him to do incredible things. I also 
take that response with a grain of 
salt — “Alone on the Wall” is Alex 
presenting himself carefully to his 
readers. Other climbers are quick 
to call bullshit on his convoluted 
risk/reward 
equations, 
noting 
that he can’t control everything, 
that it’s a matter of when, not if, 
he falls.
Alex would be the first to 
tell you that he’s thought about 
this, and considered it deeply. 
He explains in his book that he 
doesn’t understand the point of 
living a life without passion, and 
if that mortality is inevitable 
anyway, why not go out doing 
what he loves. But he’s also clear 
about the fact that he’s not a 
daredevil — he loves living and 
loves climbing, and he’s said many 
times in his book that he steers 
clear of any kind of thrill-seeking. 
He writes: “There is no adrenaline 
rush. If I get an adrenaline rush, 
it means that something has gone 
horribly wrong.” He’s not trying 
to get away with anything — 
instead he’s on a lifelong project to 
slowly and incrementally become 

a braver, better person.
When the filmmakers asked 
him in “Free Solo” why he lives 
the way he does, he gave an 
answer that’s been ringing in 
my head since I first heard it 
months ago (and the answer that 
I can only imagine has haunted 
him years). He puts it simply: “If 
you’re looking for perfection, free 
soloing is as close as you can get.”
He’s not wrong. One mistake 
and it’s all over. And let’s be 
absolutely clear here: A “mistake” 
in soloing is placing a thumb and 
index finger a millimeter too 
close together. Or letting his eyes 
wander from the rock in front of 
him for exactly one second. It’s 
not just focus or physical stamina 
that’s required to free solo at 
Alex’s level — it’s absolute clarity. 
While he’s climbing, Alex is 
paying attention to the movement 
of every muscle and sinew in his 
body. He knows exactly what 
he’s doing and exactly who he 
is. All the philosophical things 
that for most people remain 
conceptual — self-actualization, 
self-sufficiency, staying present 
— aren’t an abstract for Alex 
Honnold. They’re a matter of life 
or death.
It’s easy to get caught up 
in the grand scale of all of his 
achievements — the legendary 
free solos he has pioneered, the 
sweeping expeditions in Chad, 
Morocco, Alaska and Patagonia, 
the multiday big wall linkups in 
which he shattered every known 
speed record in Yosemite. But 
despite all that, it’s the minutiae 
of his work that I find the most 
fascinating, because it’s clear that 
the details are what his survival 
relies on. He dreams big, yes, but 
what differentiates Alex from 
others with big abstract goals is 
his ability to break down every 
dream into its components and 
create a multistep plan as to how 
to achieve them.
Case in point: In both “Alone 
on the Wall,” and in the film, 
Alex talks about his feet a lot. In 
a conversation in the film with 
fellow 
legendary 
free 
soloist 

Peter Croft, the two talk about 
their favorite part of soloing: how 
firmly rooted their feet get in the 
wall when they’re in the zone. 
These are two men who’ve scaled 
massive peaks and shattered 
records, but notice where they 
find the real joy — in the process, 
in the component parts of a big 
achievement. They don’t focus 
on the thrill of reaching the 
top, or the daredevil moments 
in which they almost died, but 
on the feeling of rootedness. In 
the book, he describes feeling 
perfectly planted when he’s high 
on a wall, climbing with complete 
certainty that he won’t fall. “It’s 
that certainty,” he writes, “that 
keeps me from falling.”
There’s a lot to learn from Alex 
Honnold, but to me that’s the 
biggest piece — the ability to feel 
rooted anywhere you go, to build 
yourself a place where you’re 
certain you belong. Alex has made 
a living by making a home out of 
some of the most hostile places on 
earth — deserts and tundras and 
the tallest peaks in the world. He’s 
alone up there on the wall, yes, but 
when he’s up there he’s entirely 
complete. His solitude while 
climbing is pure, because when 
he’s up there, he needs no one and 
nothing but himself. It’s a quiet 
confidence that sustains him, a 
wholehearted belief in himself, 
his hands and his strength.
When I watch Alex Honnold 
climb, it makes me crave that 
perfect solitude, the simultaneous 
rootedness and weightlessness he 
experiences when the sum total 
of his existence in that moment 
hinges on putting one foot in front 
of the other. Alex describes that 
feeling as ‘perfection.’ But I like 
to think of it as something a little 
more complicated, and a little 
more human: pure and absolute 
joy. We sometimes conflate being 
alone with being lonely, but in 
doing so, we forget how magical 
perfect quiet can be, how good it 
is to be alone. Feet firmly planted, 
one on front of the other — you 
always have everything you need 
to create something beautiful.

BOOKS NOTEBOOK

Initially, Andrew Bird’s 
latest album, My Finest Work, 
felt 
lackluster. 
Granted, 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
musical stylings of Andrew 
Bird, “easy listening” isn’t 
his forte. I don’t mean 
“easy listening” as in chill 
relaxation, but rather as low-
brain-energy music. 
The type of music 
you play when you 
trudge home world-
weary at the end 
of the week; the 
music 
you 
listen 
to when you want 
to turn your brain 
off. At first listen, I 
made the mistake 
of 
sitting 
down 
to a musical meal 
with Andrew Bird 
in the midst of a 
week’s 
whirlwind. 
Unsurprisingly, 
my brain balked at 
Bird’s demand for 
undivided 
focus 
and 
attention; 
multilayered lyrics 
and symbolism were 
drowned in my mind’s futile 
search for a catchy, jaunty 
tune.
Again, that’s not to say 
Andrew Bird’s music is not 
catchy, or that it isn’t suited 
for a lazy, sunny day. It is all 
those things, but also much, 
much more. And that “more” 
is where the true power of 
the album arises.
With 
his 
trademark 
orchestration of heavy bass 
and 
light-footed 
violin, 
Bird’s masterful songwriting 
is center-stage. The many 
layers of his songs are hidden 
within unique lyrics and non-
traditional song structure.
Songs 
like 
“Sisyphus” 
recall haunting echoes of 
antiquity, harkening back 
to the ancient Greek myth 
of Sisyphus, a sly trickster 
who cheated death twice. As 
eternal punishment Sisyphus 

was charged with carrying a 
boulder up a hill, never to 
succeed in this maddening 
task. The myth was meant 
to warn others from folly of 
trying to cheat the natural 
order. However, in his song 
Andrew Bird seems to speak 
from the mind of Sisyphus 
— the condemned — calling 
to “Let it roll, let it crash 
down.” In a sense, the song 
speaks to the futility of 

living a life within borders 
and expectations, of taking 
control of your own fate.
Later in the album, “Don 
the Struggle” provides a 
stylistic breath of fresh air. 
The song starts slow, to a 
steady, weary march. Bird 
sings “Let’s settle down / 
We’re all just stumbling 
down,” 
echoing 
a 
sense 
of 
bone-deep 
exhaustion 
— but instead of physical 
weariness, the implication 
points again to the burden of 
greater expectations. Later 
the song breaks out into a 
sudden burst of vibrancy. The 
tempo drastically increases, 
like a car speeding up. 
Then someone slams on the 
breaks, and the energy dive-
bombs back into the somber 
march. In the energetic haze, 
Bird sings “But dissonance 
is energy while consonance 

reminds you of poverty” 
— another critique of the 
suffocation of the cookie-
cutter lifestyle. 
The final track, “Bellevue 
Bridge Club,” is comfortable, 
slow and eerie. What seems at 
first to be a somewhat sweet 
song quickly becomes a little 
… questionable when one 
tunes into the lyrics. Andrew 
Bird crafts a strange, twisted 
love song, singing “I will hold 
you 
hostage 
… 
You know there’s 
no you without 
me.” It’s almost 
reminiscent 
of 
Stockholm 
syndrome. 
However, 
the 
line, 
“And 
I 
will 
hold 
you 
hostage/ 
Make 
you part of my 
conspiracy,” hints 
at 
something 
deeper: Following 
the 
theme 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
album 
of 
breaking through 
limitations, 
this 
last 
song 
symbolizes 
the 
perspective of the 
majority: Those who form the 
rules want everyone else to 
fall in line. But, in fact, rather 
than an encouragement of 
the herd-mentality, Andrew 
Bird calls attention to it in 
order to orchestrate a break 
to freedom from this well-
beaten, suffocating path.
Ultimately, 
Andrew 
Bird is not the artist of the 
inattentive or indifferent. 
As a songwriter, he demands 
total and devoted attention. 
Bird makes every word count 
and forces the audience to 
pay attention to even the 
smallest details of his songs 
in order to capture the 
entirety of his multi leveled 
creations. Andrew Bird and 
his latest album is a prime 
example of how music can 
be an active, rather than 
passive, experience for artist 
and listener.

Andrew Bird finds his
voice in a masterpiece

A few months ago, the writer Rachel Syme asked 
on Twitter, “Who is a woman, who, growing up, 
you always thought of as kind of a public joke but 
upon getting older you realized her story wasn’t 
so funny after all.” Thousands of replies poured 
in: the elderly woman who sued McDonald’s in 
the famous hot coffee case, Monica Lewinsky, 
Judy 
Garland, 
Tonya Harding, 
Yoko Ono. It was 
a 
discomfiting 
reminder 
of 
all the women 
unfairly written 
off, left to the 
wrath 
of 
a 
vicious 
public 
and 
an 
even 
more 
vicious 
tabloid press.
Among 
the 
more 
popular 
answers 
to 
Syme’s 
prompt 
was 
Marcia 
Clark, the lead 
prosecutor 
in 
the O.J. Simpson 
trial, who, for 
a few months in 1995, was subjected to the most 
derisive, intrusive media coverage imaginable. 
Her sartorial choices were mocked, her marital 
troubles dissected for entertainment. When 
the O.J. case was revisited in the form of two 
spectacular TV shows in 2016 — an eight-hour 
documentary on ESPN and an FX miniseries — it 
only seemed right that Clark be reappraised with 
it.
And she was. When Sarah Paulson won an 
Emmy for her thoughtful portrayal of Clark 
in FX’s “American Crime Story: People v. O.J. 
Simpson,” the actress took the opportunity to 
offer a personal and symbolic apology: “The more 
I learned about the real Marcia Clark … I had to 
recognize that I, along with the rest of the world, 
had been superficial and careless in my judgment. 
And I am glad to be able to stand here today in 
front of everyone and tell you I’m sorry.”
But Clark’s redemption is only a recent 
development. 
The 
first 
season 
finale 
of 
“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” had Tina Fey 

doing a particularly cruel impression — bumbling, 
inept, unfortunately-permed — as late as 2015. 
A little empathy now hardly makes up for two 
decades of ridicule. Can you really blame Marcia 
Clark for wanting a do-over?
She gets one on ABC’s new drama “The Fix,” if 
only a fictional one. The show, executive produced 
by Clark, imagines a maligned prosecutor being 
given a second chance to convict the beloved 
Black celebrity who got away. Maya Travis (Robin 
Tunney, “The Mentalist”) is living a quiet life 
on a ranch in 
Washington 
State eight years 
after failing to 
convict the actor 
Sevvy 
Johnson 
(Adewale 
Akinnuoye-
Agbaje, 
“Lost”) 
of 
the 
double 
homicide 
of 
his 
wife 
and 
her friend. But 
Maya 
springs 
back into action 
when her former 
co-prosecutor 
(Adam 
Rayner, 
“Tyrant”) 
shows up on her 
doorstep to ask 
for help: Sevvy’s 
girlfriend has been found bludgeoned to death on 
a beach, and this time, the Los Angeles County 
DA’s office wants to win.
It’s about as O.J. as you can get without it being 
the real thing. There’s an oily, coiffed Robert 
Kardashian-Robert Shapiro wannabe defense 
lawyer, a floppy-haired Kato Kaelin analogue 
living in the pool house, rumors of a dalliance 
between the prosecutors. To its credit, “The Fix” 
doesn’t try to pretend this is anything other than 
what it is: pure wish fulfillment, a postmortem 
revenge fantasy. Beyond that intrigue, there 
isn’t much here. There’s some slick production, 
self-important lines about carrying out justice 
and some very good-looking people delivering 
them — ABC is a perfect home for it. It’s mostly 
entertaining, with one caveat: A story about a 
white woman on a revenge crusade to lock up a 
rage-filled Black man plays a little awkwardly in 
2019. And if we learned anything from the O.J. 
revisiting in 2016, it’s that telling one side of a 
story doesn’t do anyone much good.

The Fix 

ABC

Pilot

Mondays @ 10 p.m.

Following 
the 
unqualified 
success of “Wonder Woman,” 
the equally unqualified failure 
of “Justice League” and that 
time they let James Wan dose 
the entire world with a cocktail 
of crack cocaine, LSD 
and seaweed, it’s safe 
to say that the future 
of the DC films slate 
is somewhat in flux, 
to say nothing of the 
numerous 
behind-
the-scenes 
shake-
ups. The burden was 
on “Shazam!” (along 
with “Aquaman”) to 
shine a light on where 
things are going next. 
Are they going to keep 
trying to chase that 
most elusive of white 
whales, the Marvel-
style shared universe? 
Or 
are 
the 
rumors 
true 
that they’ll focus more on 
individual stories rather than 
risk another “Justice League”-
caliber cinematic belly flop? If 
“Shazam!” is any indication, 
its definitely the latter, but that 
doesn’t necessarily result in 
a better movie, as DC shows 
that even with a brighter coat 
of paint, they are committed to 
doing little more than the bare 
minimum in search of superhero 
success.
“Shazam!” has been billed as 
a classic sort of family movie in 
the vein of “Big,” and not just in 
terms of story — we’ve been told 
it’ll pack thrills and laughs for 
parents and children alike, and 
to an extent it does just that. In 
the title role, Zachary Levi (“The 
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) brings 
the youthful enthusiasm and 
boundless, likeable energy that’s 
made him a nerd icon to a role 
he was born to play: a teenager 
with the ability to transform 
into an adult superhero. Again, 
the parallels to “Big” almost 
write themselves. The message 

about the importance of family 
is a nice touch, as well, and if 
the movie is anything more than 
the sum of its parts, it’s because 
of the emotion Levi and costars 
Asher Angel (“Andi Mack”) and 
Jack Dylan Grazer (“It”) wring 
out of their scenes as foster 
brothers.
“Shazam!” is an old-fashioned 

movie in another way, though 
— like last year’s “Venom,” it’s 
the kind of superhero movie 
that was getting made before 
we knew they were capable of 
more. It feels like it’s from a 
time where it was enough to 
cast a couple likeable actors, 
put one of them in a supersuit 
and have them punch bad guys 
with the exact same power set 
as them, but it’s 2019, and the 
genre has moved on. “Black 
Panther” just won three Oscars 
and got nominated for Best 
Picture. “Into the Spiderverse” 
was one of the best movies of 
last year and opened an entire 
multiverse of possibilities for 
animation going forward. DC’s 
own “Wonder Woman” dragged 
the genre kicking and screaming 
into an era it should have entered 
long ago, but two years later, DC 
is back to playing catch-up, not 
with Marvel, but with superhero 
filmdom itself.
I’m not saying that every 
superhero movie has to be a 
success on the level of those 
films; that would be deeply 

unfair. But a little effort outside 
of the bare minimum is a 
necessity at this point. Write 
a three-dimensional cast, or a 
villain worthy of the actor you 
cast in the role or something 
interesting. That’s where these 
movies — where any movies 
— live and breathe. “Ant-Man 
and the Wasp” doesn’t have a 
good story, but what it 
does have that makes 
it easy to return to is a 
great cast of characters. 
Outside 
of 
Billy 
Batson 
(Angel/Levi) 
and Freddy Freeman 
(Grazer) not a single 
member of the cast 
of “Shazam!” gets a 
personality outside of 
their one quirk: the one 
who plays video games, 
the one going to college, 
the one who … talks, 
etc. Then there’s Mark 
Strong 
(“Kingsman: 
The Golden Circle”) as 
Thaddeus Sivana, a villain who 
stops the film cold whenever 
he appears. His requisite CGI 
cohorts, despite ostensibly being 
the driving force of the plot, 
apparently don’t even merit the 
effort it would take to animate 
their mouths moving when they 
speak.
“Shazam!” isn’t necessarily a 
step backward for DC, because 
at 
the 
very 
least, 
they’ve 
stopped mucking around in 
monochromatic 
doom 
and 
gloom, but it’s representative of 
something just as bad: stagnation. 
It’s good for a chuckle here and 
there and anything that gets 
Levi’s name on a marquee will 
always be somewhat welcome to 
me, but its overly simplistic story 
and underwritten characters 
are reminiscent of an era comic 
book movies are quickly leaving 
behind. If DC wants a chance 
at keeping up, they need to 
understand that adding a few 
jokes isn’t the solution, it’s 
taking a page from the superhero 
handbook 
and 
becoming 
something more.

game with latest ‘Shazam’

Shazam!

Warner Bros. Pictures

Early Screening

This 
past 
weekend 
MUSKET, 
the 
University’s 
student-run musical theatre 
organization, 
presented 
“Legally Blonde,” directed by 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance senior BFA directing 
candidate Bruna d’Avila and 
produced by a team of all 
female producers.
The 
musical 
has 
some 
serious undertones, which in 
the “Me Too” era takes on a 
different face. d’Avila set out 
to reinvent what we think of 
when we think “Elle Woods” 
and her connection to modern, 
third wave feminism. As I 
watched the musical play out 
on that glorious Power Center 
stage, no longer was Elle a 
breezy, materialistic blonde 
on the hunt for a man. Instead, 
in MUSKET’s world, Elle is a 
fierce feminist in a universe 
that 
pushes 
back 
against 
her integrity, proving that 
surface level judgements don’t 
aggregate in truth.
d’Avila’s 
direction 
was 
thoughtful 
and 
poignant, 
with an astute lens on the 
political implications of the 
text and how it can stretch 
and resonate with audiences 
today. She focused not only 
on aesthetic, but substance, 
giving 
audiences 
spoonfuls 
of what they remember from 
the film along with added 
layers of depth. The happy-go-
lucky dialogue and impressive 
ensemble 
dance 
numbers 
choreographed 
by 
SMTD 
junior 
Maya 
Alwan 
read 
as nothing short of a party 
you just can’t help but want 
to join and married nicely 
with a strong consideration 
on the true themes of the 
story. d’Avila dug into the 
text, finding the exceptional 

moments to highlight amidst 
the zeal and the sequins.
Mikaela 
Secada, 
SMTD 
sophomore 
BFA 
musical 
theatre candidate, who took 
the stage by storm as Elle 
Woods, is nothing short of a 
star. She vocally carried the 
show — her clear, strong belt 
filled the Power Center, which 
is not an easily accomplished 
feat. She proved herself a 
triple 
threat, 
mastering 
Alwan’s choreography in three 
inch heels, riffing her way 
through act one finale “So 
Much Better” and bringing 
a new light to Elle Woods. 
She managed to render Elle 
as something more than the 
charming ingenue we’re quick 
to see her as. Secada’s Elle was 
as a passionate young woman 
with 
motivated 
choices, 
nuanced 
thoughtfulness, 
a 
selfless 
energy 
and 
peppy 
resilience — even when the 
world wants her to fail. Secada 
took the stereotypes Elle could 
be reduced to and subverted 
them. 
Secada’s Elle Woods isn’t 
the Elle we picture in our 
head — and that’s where 
the magic comes from. As 
a 
Cuban-American 
woman, 
the possibility to play Elle 
Woods was never on her 
radar. It has only recently 
become more common to see 
members of the Latinx and 
minority communities playing 
traditionally white roles. It 
takes directors like d’Avila 
and young theatre makers 
like Secada to blaze a trail for 
more inclusive casting going 
forward.
When 
asking 
d’Avila, 
in an interview about the 
casting choice, she said, “My 
Elle Woods is Latina. In 
discussions with her about 
how we felt about that choice, 
Mikaela Secada told me, ‘I just 
never thought I could be Elle 

Woods, it is an amazing role, 
but I never considered it one 
of my dream roles because I 
didn’t look like her.’ It’s actors 
like 
Mikaela 
Secada 
who 
expand young performer of 
color’s view of what they can 
do on stage.”
Along 
with 
the 
nontraditional casting, which 
comments on the trajectory 
theatre is on toward a more 
inclusive reality, d’Avila made 
choices to open the piece 
to 
a 
larger 
socio-political 
dimension as well. Professor 
Callahan, 
the 
brusque, 
misogynistic 
law 
professor 
played by SMTD sophomore 
Henry 
Pederson, 
another 
strong 
cast 
standout, 
was 
dressed in a navy blue suit 
and a red tie, appearing eerily 
similar to a certain current 
U.S. president, as he belittled 
and picked on Elle to the point 
of sexual assault in the climax 
of the musical. 
The 
backbone 
of 
the 
excellence was the imaginative, 
multi-functional set. Rendered 
by SMTD Bachelor Theatre 
Art senior Emma Somers, it 
consisted of moving walls to 
exhibit multiple locations. This 
innovative set design allowed 
for 
seamless 
transitions 
between scenes.
d’Avila truly outdid herself 
with 
MUSKET’s 
“Legally 
Blonde”, proving that she is 
ready for a larger career in 
pushing 
and 
illuminating 
minority 
stories 
on 
stage. 
MUSKET’s 
production 
of 
“Legally 
Blonde” 
was 
a 
sugar rush with no cavity, a 
believe in yourself comedy 
with a feminist protagonist 
and 
surprisingly 
weighty 
undertones. It is a perfectly 
pink confectionary experience 
which 
leaves 
you 
winded, 
thoughtful, 
pleasantly 
surprised and dancing straight 
out of the theatre.

In win, Michigan turns Gators’ water off, advances to Sweet Sixteen

DES MOINES, Iowa — Two 
years 
ago, 
when 
Michigan 
upset No. 2 seed Louisville to 
reach the Sweet Sixteen, John 
Beilein, Super Soaker in hand, 
crept into the locker room 
and sprayed water all over his 
jubilant players.
Luke 
Yaklich, 
then 
an 
assistant 
at 
Illinois 
State, 
wasn’t around to experience it. 
But on Saturday, the Wolverines 
advanced to the Sweet Sixteen 
with a 64-49 win over Florida, 
and afterwards, Yaklich’s light-
brown close crop was matted 
down with water, the product 
of a celebratory bottle-pouring.
Yaklich was perfectly fine 

with it — sophomore forward 
Isaiah Livers said he ran “right 
for the water.” But if he had 
been upset and in search of for a 
culprit, Charles Matthews was 
to blame.
“He literally said this: Going 
into the Sweet Sixteen, you’ll 
know that feeling when you 
pour water on the head coach,” 
Livers said. “He said, ‘Think 
about pouring water on the 
coaches when they come in here 
after we win.’ ”
The redshirt junior’s speech 
came at halftime as Michigan 
led, 32-28 — a lead that felt like 
it should have been larger. The 
Gators were kept in the contest 
by a 6-for-12 shooting display 
from outside, uncharacteristic 
of 
a 
33.4 
percent 
3-point 

shooting team. This was even 
more the case seeing as many 
of Florida’s threes were tough, 
closely-guarded attempts.
Eight minutes into the first 
half, 
Jalen 
Hudson heaved 
a 
three 
from 
several 
feet 
behind the arc. 
Jordan 
Poole 
did 
everything 
asked 
of 
him 
— 
he 
moved 
his feet, timed 
his 
jump 
and 
contested 
the 
shot well — but 
the sophomore guard was still 
left shaking his head as the ball 
smacked off the backboard and 
into the net.

“We’ll live with them hitting 
tough shots,” Poole said. “Not 
a lot of teams are able to be 
in a situation where they can 
make tough shots throughout 
the entire night, 
and if they do, 
tip your hats to 
them.”
But 
the 
Wolverines 
weren’t 
about 
to take off their 
caps just yet.
First 
came 
the 
strategic 
adjustment. 
Point 
guard 
Andrew Nembhard ran the 
Gators’ offense to perfection in 
the first half, dishing out five 
assists as Michigan couldn’t 

stop him from getting downhill 
out of ball-screen situations. 
The Wolverines took these away 
by going under screens to alter 
Nembhard’s vision and prevent 
his penetration.
“The 
guys 
understood the 
pattern and the 
flow 
of 
their 
offense 
and 
that’s 
where 
the 
basketball 
intelligence 
of 
our players takes 
over,” 
Yaklich 
said. 
“They 
understand 
what hurt us. They can tweak it, 
move all over the floor to take 
that away, and it ends up being 
good for us.”
At the same time, Michigan’s 
leaders — Matthews and Zavier 
Simpson — were there to make 
sure their teammates kept their 
composure, continued playing 
strong defense and trusted 
that the logical result of good 
defense would follow.
“They’re 
really 
good 
shooters, so they’re gonna make 
some of those,” Yaklich said. 
“But over the course of the 
game, you just gotta stay true to 
who you are and not make any 
lazy decisions at halftime that 
just take you out of who you are 
defensively.”
Added sophomore guard C.J. 
Baird: “The one thing is our 
leadership and that’s the one 
thing that keeps us composed. 
Even if (Hudson’s) shot goes 
in, Jordan was like, ah come 
on, I can’t believe that went in. 
The leaders are like, ‘OK, you 
played good defense, look at the 
positives there.’ Everybody’s 
like, ‘OK, we can still do this, 
even though that shot went in, 
we’re still on it all the time.’ ”
And when the Wolverines 
left the locker room, Matthews 
made sure they were, indeed, 
on it.
“First time in the huddle, 
he came and said, ‘No more 

threes. No more threes. Let’s 
limit their threes,’ ” assistant 
coach DeAndre Haynes told 
The Daily. “He held it down for 
us out there.”
What resulted 
was 
a 
second 
half 
in 
which 
Michigan’s 
defense, 
as 
usual, 
looked 
elite to both the 
eyes and the stat 
sheet.
Nembhard 
had just three 
assists 
against 
two 
turnovers. 
Florida hit 3-of-14 3-pointers. 
It scored just 21 points. The 
Wolverines, meanwhile, scored 
the first 11 points of the second 
half, and after weathering an 
offensive dry spell of their own, 
dunked the Gators out of the 
NCAA Tournament.
When it was all said and done, 
Michigan had not only “shut 
their water off,” as Matthews 
demanded, but found its own 
water, using it to celebrate a 
15-point victory.
At this point, you don’t need 
any more evidence that the 
Wolverines will ride or die with 
their defense. It’s their identity, 
and they’re proud of it. And on 
Saturday, this meant rejecting 
the radical idea that opposing 
players 
will 
sometimes 
hit 
shots.
Instead, Michigan put its 
clamps down as hard as it has 
all season.
“The 
defensive 
identity 
starts with our leaders and our 
coaching and those guys, like 
taking pride in your matchup, 
taking pride in those shots,” 
Baird said. “I don’t think last 
year you would have seen 
Jordan Poole get upset about 
a shot going in over him. Now, 
with the culture we brought in 
and the coaches we brought in, 
it’s really been important to us.
“It 
really 
helps 
us 
win 
games.”

The Michigan men’s basketball team celebrated in the locker room after Saturday’s 64-49 win over Florida by splashing each other and the coaches with water.

Big innings holding Wolverines back

Three outs.
String them together however 
you can – a grounder, a strikeout, 
a pop-up; a double play, a triple 
play, a runner caught stealing.
No matter how it happens, 
lately, that’s all that has stood 
between the Michigan baseball 
team and success: three outs. 
The Wolverines have been 
allowing big innings in crucial 
matchups. Their usual lights-
out pitching has shown flaws, 
and as they face increasingly 
tough competition, those flaws 
are being exploited, causing 
significant problems for Team 
153. 
Their 
series 
against 
No. 
11 Texas Tech is the perfect 
example. In Thursday’s game, 
they gave up six runs in the fifth 
inning. On Friday, they gave up 
five runs in the sixth inning. And 
in Saturday’s contest, there was 
only one inning in which the Red 
Raiders did not score.
“They hit against us almost 
like they knew every pitch that 
was coming,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “They took 
advantage of our mistakes. They 
did to us what we’ve done to a lot 
of the teams we’ve played and 

opened up a big margin.”
Whether it’s been defensive 
errors, Jimmy Kerr and Blake 
Nelson already have six errors 
apiece on the season; pitching 
difficulties, third starter Jeff 
Criswell has racked up a 4.41 
earned run average over 30.1 
innings; or a combination of the 
two, Michigan has not been able 
to string together those three 
outs. And their opponents are 
making them pay. 
Texas 
Tech 
swept 
the 
Wolverines in their three-game 
series. Michigan’s first loss of 
the season came in a game in 
which Cal State-Long Beach 
put runs on the board in three 
consecutive innings toward a 
final score of 8-7. And its 4-1 loss 
to Southern California came 
when they allowed the Trojans 
to put up two runs in two 
separate innings. 
“(Our errors) were just very 
costly, because they came at 
the most inopportune times,” 
Bakich said. “You can’t do that 
against any team, but especially 
a really good team. Every time, 
they will make you pay for it. 
And this weekend, they made us 
pay for it.”
At 
times 
this 
season, 
Michigan’s offense has also 
proven its ability to notch big 

innings. A three-run seventh 
inning against UCLA. An eight-
run third inning and a six-run 
sixth inning against Manhattan. 
A five-run sixth inning against 
Western Michigan.
All of those games were wins 
– 7-5 over the Bruins, 23-2 over 
the Jaspers and 12-5 over the 
Broncos. 
When 
the 
Wolverines 
can 
piece 
together 
several 
consecutive 
quality 
at-bats, 
they’ve proven difficult to stop.
“When we can put big innings 
together, and score three or more 
runs in an inning, it certainly 
helps us win the game,” Bakich 
said. “That’ll continue to be 
something that we leverage.”
Michigan is about to head into 
Big Ten play with a weekend 
series 
against 
nearby 
rival 
Michigan State. A home series 
against Minnesota – likely its 
toughest Big Ten competition 
– and an away weekend at Ohio 
State are not too far down the 
road. If the Wolverines can 
solidify their defense, and if 
their pitchers rediscover the 
dominance 
they 
showed 
in 
earlier stretches this season, 
they will look to be a serious Big 
Ten contender.
All that stands in the way are 
three outs. 

‘M’ Softball blows past Central 
Michigan in run-rule victory

It was a long drive from 
Ann Arbor to Mount Pleasant. 
Many players had class earlier 
in the day. The atmosphere 
wasn’t energetic.
Madison 
Uden 
changed 
that.
Led by the junior third 
baseman’s two-run home run 
in the third inning, the No. 
23 Michigan softball team 
beat Central Michigan, 8-0, 
in a five-inning run-rule win. 
With Uden’s home run and 
a three-run home run from 
senior 
infielder 
Mackenzie 
Nemitz, the win carried on the 
success the Wolverines had 
at the plate Sunday against 
Nebraska.
To start the in-state contest, 
senior 
outfielder 
Natalie 
Peters hit a single past the 
third baseman into left field. 
Freshman 
outfielder 
Lexie 
Blair followed that hit with 
a single of her own, moving 
Peters to third. With two 
Michigan players on base, 
senior 
Mackenzie 
Nemitz 
stepped to the plate. She didn’t 
mirror 
her 
performance 
in 
Sunday’s 
game 
against 
Nebraska 
— 
when she scored 
a 
booming 
home run. She 
didn’t 
even 
come out of the 
play 
on 
base. 
But 
Nemitz’s 
subsequent 
groundout to the shortstop 
drove Peters home, putting the 
Wolverines on the board early.
Already up by one run, 
Uden hit a home run to right 
field that drove her and senior 
first baseman Alex Sobczak 
— who was already on base — 
home, increasing Michigan’s 
lead to three and completely 
toppling the atmosphere at the 
Chippewas’ field.
“(The home run) lit a spark 

in us,” Nemitz said. “Traveling 
to Central Michigan was kind 
of a long drive and we all were 
kind of just dead, and after 
she hit that, it was just instant 
light-up of everybody and we 
just 
continued 
to 
play 
our 
game.”
Nemitz 
especially 
did 
that. 
After 
Peters hit a fly 
ball for a double 
that plated both 
sophomore 
shortstop 
Natalia 
Rodriguez and 
senior second baseman Faith 
Canfield to increase the score 
to 5-0, Nemitz hit a home run 
past right center field that 
brought her, Peters and Blair 
back around the bases to their 
teammates 
celebrating 
the 
team’s 8-0 lead around the 
plate.
“It feels good,” Nemitz said. 
“It’s something that I have 
known I can do, so finally 
having it happen is kind of like 

a breakthrough moment and 
kind of gives myself and my 
teammates the confidence that 
we need.”
On 
the 
mound, 
that 
confidence 
also 
showed. 
Freshman right-hander Alex 
Storako, 
who 
pitched 
all 
five innings, threw for eight 
strikeouts, allowing only two 
hits and zero runs on the day. 
The game brought Storako’s 
overall ERA down to 2.00 — 
only 0.28 behind sophomore 
Meghan Beaubien, who hasn’t 
given up a run in her almost 
30 
innings 
pitching 
since 
resuming play at Alumni Field.
“In the fourth inning, I got 
out of a bases-loaded jam, so 
going back on the field for the 
fifth inning, I just knew that 
I wanted to end the game and 
with a bang,” Storako said. 
“It’s just been exciting to be 
a part of the atmosphere in 
the dugout and on the field 
when we celebrate at the plate 
and it’s just really exciting to 
see people and their at-bats 
and just really getting to this 
point.”

Caroline Hendershot is here to stay

Caroline Hendershot is hard 
to miss.
Whether it’s her height of 
5-foot-11, her involvement in 
a student-run sports TV show 
or 
her 
cheerful 
demeanor 
guaranteed to light up any room, 
the senior on the Michigan 
rowing team is pretty distinct.

And, she has challenged the 
gender-binding 
stereotypes 
that have plagued the sports 
industry ever since she was 
little.
“I think of elementary school 
where boys would say that they 
were faster because they were 
boys,” Hendershot said. “And, I 
would do anything to beat the 
boys, making sure that I was 
the last girl left. I didn’t care if I 
was dripping in sweat. You can’t 

judge a book by its cover.”
Coming from a family where 
both her parents and all three of 
her older siblings played college 
sports, 
Hendershot 
seemed 
predestined 
for 
collegiate 
athletics.
“Family 
games 
are 
competitive to say the least,” 
she said, half-jokingly. 
Before 
committing 
to 
rowing as her sport of choice, 
Hendershot played nearly every 

sport in existence. However, 
when she found herself sitting 
down in a boat her junior year 
of high school, it was the unique 
format of rowing that sold her.
“There is a very specific 
feeling in a boat when you have 
all eight people moving in sync 
and pushing a boat at the same 
time as hard and as fast as they 
can,” she said. “It is one of the 
most incredible feelings.”
Although 
she 
faces 
long 

days of practice that regularly 
produce 
blistered 
hands, 
Hendershot 
feels 
that 
her 
teammates 
make 
everything 
worth it. In feeding off of 
their accomplishments to fuel 
her own success, Hendershot 
believes that her teammates 
have driven her to become both 
a better person and a stronger 
rower.
When 
she’s 
not 
rowing, 
Hendershot 
works 
with 
Wolverine 
Women, an all-
female 
sports 
talk 
show 
on 
WOLV 
TV, 
a 
student-run 
television 
station.
What 
began 
as a desire to get 
more 
involved 
on 
campus 
the fall of her 
sophomore year quickly evolved 
into something larger. Two 
years later, Hendershot serves 
as an executive producer for 
Wolverine 
Women, 
doing 
everything from brainstorming 
storylines to obtaining athletes 
for segments.
Her enthusiasm for the show 
comes from her personability 
— she wants to tell stories 
the average fan might not be 
aware of. After graduation, 
Hendershot hopes to work in 
sports broadcasting.
“Interviewing 
people 
is 
something that I love feeding 
off of because I love finding 
out who people are,” she said. 
“Obviously, I can’t let (sports) 
go after four years, so I want 
to go into (broadcasting) and 
be able to help people tell 
their stories and express that 
different perspective.”
In terms of ambition, she 
considers the community of 
Wolverine Women to be very 

similar to that of her team.
“Everyone is so supportive 
and so uplifting and wants 
everyone to succeed,” she said. 
“They helped me realize that 
yes, you can be competitive, but 
you can also bring others along 
with you.”
In 
December 
2017, 
she 
interned with Tracy Wolfson 
— a CBS sports broadcaster and 
a Michigan alum — whom she 
views as a role model both as a 
woman in sports 
and as a person. 
Hendershot 
got to spend a 
weekend 
with 
Wolfson 
when 
she 
worked 
as 
an 
NFL 
correspondent 
with 
the 
New 
England Patriots 
and 
Buffalo 
Bills.
At the end of the day, 
Hendershot 
feels 
that 
everything distills down to 
a statement of purpose. As 
a woman in sports, she feels 
that her role is to push down 
boundaries.
“Hopefully, 
when 
I 
have 
a career, I want to help open 
doors for other women that 
want to get into the industry,” 
she said.
To Hendershot, graduating 
this May will be bittersweet. 
She 
is 
grateful 
for 
her 
experience over the past four 
years and is obviously sad that 
it is ending, but is extremely 
excited to navigate the world 
with the skills she has learned 
at Michigan.
“I am really happy that I 
came here for my experience,” 
she said. “There is nothing like 
representing the University of 
Michigan with a block M on 
your back. That is the biggest 
thing I’m going to miss.”

Men’s golf improves during final 
round of Tar Heel Intercollegiate

The Michigan men’s golf 
team entered the final round 
of the Tar Heel Intercollegiate 
at the UNC Finley Golf Course 
looking to recover from a 
disappointing 
opening 
two 
rounds. The Wolverines were 
left trailing the rest of the field 
by the time players teed off 
Sunday morning in Chapel Hill.
After shooting a combined 
37 strokes over par as a team 
during the first two rounds and 
sitting in last place out of 14 
teams after Saturday, Michigan 
coach Chris Whitten and the 
Wolverines were determined 
to respond.
“It was unacceptable the way 
we played the first two rounds 
and we know we’re better than 
that,” Whitten said.
In 
previous 
tournaments 
this season, Whitten felt that 
his team played well in final 
rounds, and the Wolverines did 
just that on Sunday.
Despite being 39 strokes 
out of the lead and without a 
viable path back to contention, 
Michigan was unfazed and 

settled 
down 
to 
improve 
its overall team score. The 
Wolverines 
rebounded 
by 
scoring three under par to 
elevate themselves from last 
place to twelfth. The Michigan 
coaching 
staff 
noticed 
an 
increased level in confidence 
and comfort on the course 
on Sunday after lackluster 
performances up to that point.
“We were determined to 
play very solid golf with good 
decisions and good attitudes 
today and take a step in the 
right direction going into the 
next 
tournament,” 
Whitten 
said.
The 
home 
squad, 
North 
Carolina, took the top spot on 
the leaderboard as a team over 
the weekend, while Illinois’ 
Adrien Dumont de Chassart 
dominated 
the 
competition 
individually 
by 
outshooting 
the next closest opponent by 
six strokes. North Carolina 
was the only team to remain 
under par by the tournament’s 
conclusion.
Standout 
performances 
by 
Michigan 
came 
from 
sophomore 
Henry 
Spring 
and 
senior 
Nick 
Carlson. 

Spring finished as the team’s 
lowest scorer for the second 
consecutive tournament, tying 
for 18th place after a successful 
two-under-par 
outing 
on 
Sunday. Carlson finished tied 
for 31st overall by shooting two 
under par on Sunday and seven 
over par in total.
The Wolverines now turn 
their attention to the Aggie 
Invitational in Bryan, Texas, 
where they will most likely face 
their toughest field all year. 
Thus far this season, Whitten 
believes that Michigan has not 
arrived at its full potential. 
But the next tournament could 
offer the chance to change that 
narrative.
“We know we have a good 
team and we haven’t put it on 
the scoreboard as many times 
as we wanted to this year,” 
Whitten said. “So this would be 
a great opportunity to go show 
some people that we can post 
the scores that we know we’re 
capable of.”
The Wolverines will need to 
start off future tournaments 
as well as they did in the final 
round on Sunday to reach the 
top of the leaderboard.

Youth offers high hopes for future

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Right 
now, the wound is likely still 
fresh.
On Sunday afternoon, the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team saw its season end when 
it bowed out of the NCAA 
Tournament following a 70-51 
loss to top-seeded Louisville. 
While it may be hard to see it 
now, this year’s tournament 
run may have laid the bricks 
that will eventually serve as the 
program’s foundation.
Not 
long 
ago, 
Michigan 
head 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico announced the nation’s 
12th-ranked recruiting class, 
which 
was 
headlined 
by 
freshmen forward Naz Hillmon 
and guard Amy Dilk.
Tasked with the impossible 
job of replacing the production 
of 
the 
program’s 
all-time 
leading scorer Katelyn Flaherty, 
Dilk ran the offense with great 
efficiency — as if she was a 
seasoned veteran. While there 
were some bumps along the 
way, Dilk looks poised and 
ready to handle having the keys 
to the Wolverines’ offense.
“I’ve learned a lot obviously, 
mentally 
and 
physically, 
growing as a player,” Dilk said 
on Friday after the team’s win 
against Kansas State.
Hillmon, on the other hand, 
became one of the biggest 
surprises 
of 
the 
season, 
averaging 
a 
team-high 
13.1 
points and 7.0 rebounds per 
game despite coming off the 
bench. 
The 
season 
helped 
Hillmon earn two honors: the 
media’s Big Ten Freshman of 
the Year and the coaches’ Big 
Ten Sixth Player of the Year.
If 
she 
continues 
her 
exceptional play, it’s hard to 
imagine that these accolades 
won’t be the last she receives 
in her career. For Hillmon, 
though, the bond she shares 
with her teammates means far 
more than whatever awards 
might come her way.
“This has been the most 
fun 
year 
I’ve 
had 
playing 
basketball,” 
Hillmon 
said. 

“We’re really close as a team, 
that’s what makes it a lot of fun. 
That’s all that matters.”
Despite having just finished 
their first collegiate seasons, 
Hillmon and Dilk represent the 
next generation of Michigan 
basketball. 
While 
seniors 
forward Hallie Thome and 
guard Nicole Munger helped to 
establish Michigan basketball as 
an NCAA Tournament-caliber 
squad, the next generation will 
be responsible for keeping it 
there. Barnes Arico believes 
that her squad is more than up 
to the challenge.
“We are going to respond 
and we are going to show that 
it’s not just one year,” Barnes 
Arico said following the loss 
to Louisville. “We’re going to 
be (in the NCAA Tournament) 
year-in and year-out and we 
want to take the next steps in 
the program.”
Next season, the Wolverines 
will be without Munger and 
Thome, who helped set the tone 
for the team’s culture both on 
and off the court. Despite losing 
two of its key pieces, Michigan 
will return virtually its entire 
roster, all of whom should only 
continue to grow and develop 

with a season or more under 
their belts.
“This is probably one of the 
first teams in my career that I 
have to throw them out of the 
gym after practice,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They want to 
continue getting shots up or 
they want to continue working 
or they want to get better.”
Of 
course, 
a 
second 
consecutive defeat at the hands 
of one of the nation’s most 
dangerous squads will be a 
tough pill to swallow. That being 
said, if this Wolverine team has 
proven anything this season, it’s 
that it is more than prepared to 
put in the extra work to not only 
stay on the mountain that is the 
NCAA Tournament, but also 
reach its peak. And while this 
year’s departing class was never 
able to reach that point, those 
who will be able to fight another 
season are more than prepared 
to get there.
 “We have a lot of great pieces 
coming back and our kids know 
that they are hungry to take 
those next steps in the NCAA 
Tournament,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said.
With this group, these next 
steps look within reach.

Clearing the in-betweens 


T

he night my first 
Daily 
article 
ran, 
I 
found 
myself sleepless, so I 
popped on some sneakers 
and went for a jog under 
the midnight moon.
There isn’t anything 
quite like the sensation 
of running in Ann Arbor 
after dark, I learned that 
night. Sprinting north up 
Washtenaw Avenue, all 
five lanes will be devoid 
of traffic while 20-foot-
high traffic lamps and the 
glass-paneled biomedical 
complex tower over you. 
Crossing the Broadway 
Bridge south into Ker-
rytown, you can see the 
Medical 
Center 
shine 
atop a hill in the distance, 
and hear the black river 
water 
gurgle 
beneath 
your feet.
At 6 a.m. the morning 
after, I giddily hopped 
out of bed and finagled 
a 
newly-arrived 
copy 
of The Daily from the 
Markley Residence Hall 
newsstand while still in 
my pajamas, and read my piece 
below the fold of the front page. 
Then I read it again, and then 
again, absorbing my own words 
from the raggedy newsprint 
paper before me, searching for 
some sense of attainment.
There was a magic in seeing 
the event I had covered — a cam-
pus visit by an alum-turned-con-
gressman — translated to words 
on a Google Doc, and then tran-
scribed to newsprint, printed 
out 10,000 times and dispersed 
around the city. Yet at the same 
time, I somehow felt I hadn’t 
yet done enough. There were so 
many stories to be written, so 
much more to be achieved.
This 
sense 
of 
insecurity 
has been pervasive during my 
four years in Ann Arbor. It has 
manifested itself as a constant 

fear that I wouldn’t be “good 
enough,” 
and 
an 
overriding 
obsession with external accom-
plishments — grades, internships 
and the pettiest of distinctions. 
Any opportunity to succeed was 
also an opportunity to fail, and it 
terrified me.
Arguably, this fear has helped 
me. In a month, I’ll be extremely 
fortunate to graduate and join 
a firm I couldn’t have dreamed 
of working for as a freshman. 
I’m also grateful for having the 
opportunity to pour my heart 
into The Daily, and to leave with 
a student newspaper career I can 
be proud of. Yet, I also feel like 
that freshman reading his first-
ever Daily article — I’ve accom-
plished what I wanted, but now 
what? Four years later, I still feel 
short of that final attainment 

I tried to find in the Markley 
lobby.
Over these same four years, 
my late-night runs across town 
allowed me a regular escape into 
my own thoughts — away from 
others and my anxieties. It’s dur-
ing these runs that I felt most at 
home in Ann Arbor.
O

ne night each Decem-
ber, The Daily’s grad-
uating seniors finish 
production early, then drive to 
the industrial printer where we 
source the printed newspapers 
that plop in Ann Arbor’s morn-
ing newsstands. Over the years, 
this tradition has become the 
fabled culmination of each grad-
uating class’ years of labor.
I and four others merrily 
clambered into one of the cars 
making this midnight journey, 

our destination a nondescript 
industrial park outside of Flint. 
A line of our vehicles snaked out 
of the newsroom parking lot for 
the hour-long drive, our cara-
van quickly broken up by traf-
fic lights and other cars as we 
snaked north.
Driving late at night under a 
clear sky, you can see a bright 
white glow across the horizon 
both in front and behind you, 
light pollution emanating from 
the northern Detroit suburbs 
from one side and from Flint on 
the other. Traveling through this 
eerie zone, we passed a barn ele-
vated on a hillside, perfectly sil-
houetted black against the glow 
from Flint and illuminated under 
a full moon and starry night.
I was taken aback by the 
simple beauty of the structure 

and suggested we take a 
photo.
The 
friend 
driving 
offered to pull aside. But 
by then, the barn was well 
behind 
us, 
swallowed 
behind 
another 
hill. 
Turning around wasn’t 
yet out of the question, 
but that would just make 
us late to our destination.
A

t the end of 
every stage of 
my 
life, 
I’ve 
landed 
roughly 
where 
I’ve wanted to land, but 
also been swamped with 
new goalposts deemed 
necessary to reach an 
ever-elusive sense of sat-
isfaction, 
an 
ultimate 
attainment 
of 
adult-
hood. Admitted to your 
dream school? Great, now 
you need to get perfect 
grades. Internship offer 
from a great company? 
Cool, work your heart out 
so you can exit to an even 
“better” job next summer. 
Enjoying your work for 
The Daily? Push for that 
one last promotion.
It’s only now that I’ve real-
ized external validation alone 
can never make one truly happy.
As fortunate as I’ve been, I’ve 
cast aside the fleeting moments 
that give life its magic in the pur-
suit of some grand future end-
game. And then I’m left craning 
my neck around, trying to make 
out the outlines of the barn that 
has long since passed.
After this article goes to print 
Tuesday night, I’ll slip on my 
sneakers again and take advan-
tage of the early spring. I move 
out of my apartment the day of 
graduation, so there aren’t many 
more of these runs in Ann Arbor 
left for me.
It’s all quite a sight along my 
jogging route, and you should 
see it, too, before you leave Ann 
Arbor.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 27, 2019

ILLUSTRATION BY LAUREN KUZEE


ILLUSTRATION BY LIZ BIGHAM

Wednesday, March 27, 2019 // The Statement 

My 
first 
experience 
with 
graphic design was in seventh 
grade, recklessly using Adobe 
Photoshop to cut out blurry pho-
tos of volleyball players for my 
middle school newspaper. In my 
ninth grade journalism class, my 
first Adobe Illustrator assign-
ment consisted of inserting a 
picture of Nick Jonas and splat-
tering paint and blades of grass 
around him. Now here I am today, 
building on the skills I first started 
developing in seventh grade, as a 
designer for The Michigan Daily.
I truly thought my journalism 
career was going to end after 
high school. After years of being 
an editor for my high school’s 
weekly newspaper, I was worn 
out from dealing with the control-
ling high school administration 
and late Monday nights at school. 
However, when I got to college, I 
felt myself yearning for the chaos 
of the newsroom. My retirement 
from journalism lasted a mere 
four months because, by the end 
of September, I applied and was 
accepted as a layout designer for 
The Daily.
I chose to continue with the 
design 
aspect 
of 
journalism 
because it is what I know and 
like best. During high school, I 
can shamelessly admit I devot-
ed most of my efforts towards 
improving my paper’s design as 
opposed to the writing. A news-
paper with strong design differ-
entiates itself from others and 
leads people to read the stories 
inside.
When I say I am on The Michi-

gan Daily staff, people assume I 
must be a writer. After clarifying 
I am on The Daily’s design sec-
tion and getting an excited reac-
tion, I feel like people look at me 
differently. They assume I am 
artistic. Although I am a graphic 
designer, I can say without hesi-
tation that I have never consid-
ered myself an artist. I think that 
is why I didn’t give up on journal-
ism when coming to college — I 
wanted to continue to call myself 
a designer, a label I would never 
hold if I never practiced graphic 
design. It brings me such confi-
dence to be associated with an 
identity that consists of such cre-
ative, unique and inspiring indi-
viduals.
Most of the graphic design I 
do is layout. When I come in to 
design on Tuesdays, I first get a 
sense of the stories, photos and 
graphics I will be working with 
for the issue. Most of my time is 
spent brainstorming how I plan 
to arrange the elements in an 
organized and interesting way. 
After that, it is all about execu-
tion. I don’t think of myself as cre-
ating, but rather presenting other 
people’s art. This is why I don’t 
consider myself an artist. Artists 
start from scratch and use their 
creativity to create something 
expressive. For me, I am given 
other people’s work — usually 
articles — and display their writ-
ing in an appealing way. I feel an 
obligation to do everything in my 
power to make sure their writing 
is read and appreciated by those 
who pick up the newspaper.

A layout designer’s work can 
easily go unnoticed because we 
don’t get an explicit credit next to 
the work we do, unlike writers and 
illustrators. There is a lot of effort 
behinds the scenes. So much 
skill and diligence comes with 
knowing how to utilize Adobe’s 
software as well as coming up 
with a variance of design styles 
to complement each story. The 
work never gets boring. I have 
been doing this for more than five 
years and still learn more about 
graphic design every time I open 
up an Adobe product.
Sometimes when the design 
section is in urgent need of an 
illustration, my editors will ask, 
“I know you are on layout, but 
do you make illustrations?” and I 
quickly say no. Contrary to what 
I tell them, I do create my own 
graphics — very rarely. I don’t 
lie because I don’t want to make 
one, but because my graphics are 
not good enough to be published 
in The Daily. Like I said earlier, I 
am not an artist and am not good 
at starting from scratch. Portraits 
are the one exception of art I can 
do because it is remaking what is 
already there, which usually con-
sists of me tracing over a picture 
of a celebrity I get from the inter-
net. I simply transform a photo 
into a graphic without anything 
new being created.
The illustration above was the 
first graphic I ever made that 
wasn’t meant for a publication. I 
remember seeing a photo of the 
model and actress Cara Delev-
ingne on Instagram and immedi-

ately thinking I wanted to attempt 
to recreate the photo on Illustra-
tor. After using yet another fake 
email to get a free trial of Adobe 
and watching hours of Youtube 
tutorials on how to properly con-
tour skin tones, draw eyelashes 
and mimic bushy eyebrows, I had 
my design complete. I never did 
anything with it besides show-
ing a couple of friends. I didn’t 
even save it on my computer. A 
screenshot on my phone is the 
only evidence of the graphic I 
spent weeks on.
As the slight blurriness of the 
graphic shows, I did not really 
care about keeping the graphic 
because I did not plan on doing 
anything with it. I didn’t think it 
was particularly good. However, 
it is a great representation of my 
progression as a designer and 
is now being printed on a news-
paper distributed all around Ann 
Arbor. I am self-conscious just 
thinking about it. I still don’t think 
it’s good.
Regardless of how hard I can 
be on myself, I am extremely 
grateful to my younger self for 
sticking with graphic design. 
Having an eye for what is visually 
appealing is such a gift that can 
be utilized in all aspects of life. 
Most importantly, being a graph-
ic designer has introduced me to 
a group of like-minded individu-
als with the same interests as 
me. There is nothing I love more 
than bouncing ideas off other 
designers and talking about our 
favorite fonts. I could talk about 
fonts all day.

alking 
home 
from 
down-
town 
Ann 
Arbor last month, I watched 
an elderly couple clutch-
ing one another, walking 
carefully and diligently to 
avoid falling on the slippery 
sidewalks. The man used his 
cane for as much support as possible, 
and the woman held onto his arm for 
more balance. I was only 20 feet behind 
them when suddenly, I was swept off my 
feet and landed on the asphalt of S. 4th 
Street. I hoped that the couple did not 
also experience a similar fate, falling 
from the same black ice.
It’s inevitable that living in Ann Arbor 
–– a Midwest city where winters feel like 
eons –– comes with horrific snow, ice 
and sleet storms. Nonetheless, as a city 
whose prime modes of transportation 
include walking, biking and bus-riding, 
the need for safe roads and sidewalks 
during winter conditions is inarguable.
In addition to safety, accessibility on 
campus and within the city is another 
priority. Noting the high population of 
pedestrians and bikers in Ann Arbor is 
essential when considering the main-
tenance of our sidewalks, crosswalks, 
ramps, streets and curbs. In my own 
experience navigating public walkways, 
I’ve been lucky to overlook obstacles 
like deep puddles, slippery sidewalks 
and snow-piled tactile blocks –– the red, 

bumpy blocks placed at 
the beginning and ends of 
sidewalks used for visu-
ally-impaired people. But 
regardless of the minor 
obstacles I may face, that 
experience does not equate 
to those who can’t pass 
through at all.
Mike Heinrich is an 
advocate for Americans 
with Disabilities Act rights 
and is someone who expe-
riences 
setbacks 
while 
commuting around Ann 
Arbor. Mike is also mem-
ber of the advocacy and 
community 
group 
Dis-
ability Culture at the Uni-
versity of Michigan — also 
known as DC @ U-M. Two 
years ago, Heinrich was 
paralyzed by a dead tree 
on the University’s campus that fell on him. 
Now as a quadriplegic, he seeks to educate 
himself and the community on ADA policies, 
regulations and violations. More importantly, 
Heinrich openly speaks of his experience and 
struggles with being a quadriplegic, especially 
during winter.
“Winter used to be my favorite season … this 
year, with each snow storm after snow storm, I 
realized that when I was trying to get out and 
do things, I couldn’t be independent with the 
walkways not being taken care of,” said Hein-
rich in an interview with The Daily. Though 
his parents could drive him and drop him off 
places Heinrich mentioned the difficulty of 
finding handicap spots along the road that are 
clear of snow pile-ups and accessible.
For those who are able-bodied, a few inches 
of snow is manageable –– surely a nuisance, but 
bearable. But what happens for those with dis-
abilities whose wheels, white canes, crutches, 
walkers and other commuter accessories can’t 
cross the street or feel tactile blocks? They 
cannot safely or efficiently get to where they 
need to go. A few inches of snow or a thin sheet 
of ice could change their entire day.
Traveling via wheelchair and handicap van, 
Heinrich’s experience commuting outside is 
highly dependent on weather. If it’s snowing 
or raining, he most likely won’t even go out-
side. This is due to the difficulty of traveling 
through snow and puddles, not to mention the 
difficulty of pushing his wheels with cold, wet 
hands.
“We (the disabled community) are directly 
affected by what happens on those sidewalks,” 

Heinrich said. “Not even just handicap people: 
The reality is no one should have to deal with 
that.”
Since being paralyzed, Heinrich has devot-
ed much of his time to speaking with city and 
campus administrators about Ann Arbor’s lack 
of accessibility. Many of his arguments address 
non-ADA approved doors, entrances, ramps, 
sidewalks, elevators, parking and bathrooms. 
However, winter maintenance and accessibil-
ity isn’t as easy as changing door handles to be 
ADA-approved. Improving the maintenance 
of public spaces during winter is a difficult 
puzzle with an array of pieces –– it begins 
with a closer examination of all the moving 
parts between city regulations and resources. 
A solution would require the rigorous efforts 
and collaboration with the city, outsourced 
companies, landlords, the U-M grounds crew, 
University students and Ann Arbor residents.
A

nn Arbor Code of Ordinances, 
Chapter 4 Section 58 A. “Sidewalk 
Maintenance” states, “all sidewalks 
within the city shall be kept and maintained 
in good repair by the owner of the land … if any 
owner shall neglect to keep and maintain the 
sidewalk … safe for the use of the public, the 
said owner shall be liable to the city for any 
damages … by reason of said sidewalk being 
unsafe and out of repair.” Further down in the 
section, it reads, “‘Sidewalk’ does not include 
curb ramps … that is both adjacent to the top 
edge of one or more curb ramps and at the cor-
ner of a property.” Essentially, street corners 
where tactile blocks and curb ramps are a few 
feet apart are not considered to be part of the 
“sidewalk.” If these spaces do not fit under the 
legal definition, then technically, by the lan-
guage of the ordinances, it is not the property 
owner’s responsibility to clear it.
However, Chapter 4 Section 60 #6 of the 
Ordinances –– titled “Removal of snow and ice 
from sidewalks, walks, and ramps” –– says that 
“compliance with this section requires mak-
ing sidewalks, walks, and ramps free of snow 
and ice for their entire constructed width 
and length.” In other words, the entirety of a 
sidewalk and/or ramp should include the curb 
ramps and tactile blocks, considering that is 
the start to the sidewalk. Thus, the language in 
Section 60 contradicts the ordinance’s descrip-
tions in Section 58 on how and where sidewalk 
maintenance happens.
Some non-residential properties downtown 
can afford outsourced companies that have the 
machinery, staffing and finances to do an effi-
cient job at clearing sidewalks and curb cuts. 
Meanwhile, some property owners manually 
shovel and salt on their own.

To break down who is responsible for side-
walk maintenance and when, Section 60 
states that non-residential property (down-
town businesses, restaurants, etc.) will need to 
clear their “sidewalk” and “walks and ramps 
that are at bus stops or that lead to marked 
or unmarked crosswalks” by noon that day if 
snow is accumulated prior to 6 a.m. If a prop-
erty is residential, the owner has “24 hours 
after the end of each accumulation of snow 
greater than 1 inch” to do the same. Not only 
do non-residential businesses have six hours 
to clear their sidewalks and ramps, but resi-
dential properties have a whole 24 hours. For 

those commuting by 9 a.m. the morning of a 
snowfall, they cannot afford to wait until noon 
or even the next day to ensure safe conditions 
for travel.
If everybody is doing their part and follow-
ing the policies set by the city, why do we still 
have so many winter maintenance problems? 
The answer is simple, harsh and true: We, as 
a community are failing to meet the necessary 
standards for the disabled community. That’s 
where Community Standards comes in.
Community Standards is a unit in the Ann 
Arbor Police Department that has a “primary 
responsibility to enforce the city codes and 
ordinances that protect the public health, wel-
fare and safety of the residents.”
A2 Fix It is an app that allows community 
members to “report locations which may be in 
violation of the city snow removal ordinance.” 
From there, Community Standards staff will 
“perform an inspection,” and if the property or 
area does propose a violation, “they will then 
inspect all addresses” within the appropriate 
block “to ensure equitable treatment.”
Jessie Rogers, Community Standards super-
visor, discussed with me the logistics of their 
winter maintenance procedures and the code 

of ordinances. Rogers explained that if a prop-
erty does not do their maintenance procedure 
by noon on the day of a storm and there ends up 
being a complaint from a citizen, a representa-
tive from Community Standards will come to 
investigate the property. If their property is 
in violation, Community Standards will give a 
warning (allowed one per season).
If the violation is not treated after warning, 
Community Standards will come again, fine 
the property and fix the maintenance issue 
that was initially reported. That property may 
then receive a civil infraction ticket that is “no 
more than $100.00” according to Section 4:60 
#11. These fines can grow in numbers up to 
$1000 if violations are further ignored.
Luckily, representatives from Community 
Standards are the ones who come 
solve the issue, but only if someone in 
the community makes the complaint. 
Otherwise, they simply hope city resi-
dents are following protocol. And to 
make matters more complicated, Rog-
ers said even when they do come, it’s 
not always a smooth or fast process. 
By the time a report is made, faxed 
over to the office, sent out to a driver 
and maintenance person and someone 
finally arrives at the scene, the situ-
ation could have grown worse, with 
more snow or ice further aggravating 
the original problem.
Additionally, 
while 
Community 
Standards does fix the city’s problems, 
they don’t always have the staff or 
funds to be as efficient and effective as they’d 
like to be: “(We are) too understaffed to always 
be proactive,” Rogers said.
These winter maintenance problems, how-
ever, should not fall on the shoulders of the 
Community Standards organization. Though 
I am grateful for Community Standard’s 
assistance to clear sidewalks, the concept of 
treatment is not as powerful as prevention. 
Treatment implies a long chain of events that 
relies on many external moving parts to help 
resolve the issues. Meanwhile, preventing the 
problems is set at the beginning: the initial 
action of shoveling and salting.
The concerns are embedded within text 
and action: what the ordinances demand of its 
citizens and how and if its citizens are com-
plying. Though some of the policy language 
feels vague, confusing and almost hypocritical 
upon reading (see: curb ramps not being con-
sidered part of the sidewalk), it doesn’t excuse 
the community to settle into inaccessible prac-
tices. These are spaces that commuters use all 
day, every day, and hence, they should be pri-
oritized for winter maintenance.

From Page 5B

Understandably, major-scale winter 
maintenance is difficult for both the 
University’s campus and the city of Ann 
Arbor. Nonetheless, the enviroments 
are wildly different. Downtown and off-
campus properties are given policies 
that need to be followed by each indi-
vidual property owner, meanwhile Uni-
versity of Michigan Custodial & Grounds 
Services has teams of hired staff.
“It’s a lot of moving parts, and people 
don’t always understand the work we put 
in,” said Rob Doletzky, the University’s 
landscape and grounds manager, when 
speaking about the laborious work of 
clearing 168 miles of sidewalk each sea-
son. “Some of this (winter maintenance) 
is timing.”
He went on to tell me an example of 
how his team will clear a sidewalk that 
borders campus and the city. The city 
then goes through the street and plows 
it, but when they widen the snow to make 
streets more clear, it creates a ridge that 
goes into the curb cuts, hence creating a 
snow pile.
Doletzky explained that the team’s job 
is difficult because they work against the 
weather: “The weather throws curve-
balls,” he said. If snow is accumulat-
ing for a long period of time, it can take 
Rob’s team “four to five hours just to get 
through each route.” The grounds ser-
vices team splits up into different zones: 
East Campus, North Campus, Medical 
Campus, Central Campus and South 
Campus. With 16 parking structures, 21 
miles of roads and 11 miles of steps and 
handicap ramps, the responsibility to 
clear these spaces is never-ending.

Despite 
that 
initial first plow, 
Doletzky 
shared 
that 
“widen-
ing and moving 
snow takes days.” 
It becomes even 
more difficult if a 
snow or ice storm 
starts mid-day or 
later in the eve-
ning. 
His 
crew 
members 
can 
sometimes 
work 
up to 16 hours a 
day to get every-
thing cleared, and 
the services have 
off-shift 
people 
on call for the 
hospital to clear 
entrances 
and 
sidewalks.
To dive further 
into 
accessibil-
ity 
on 
campus, 
Doletzky and the 
Office of Services 
for Students with 
Disabilities 
are 
looking to find out 
where it is exactly 
that people need help when it comes to 
commuting around campus and knowing 
their routes.
“We’ve worked together with the 
Office of SSD,” Doletsky said. “We pri-
oritize ADA entrances first, like ramps 
… Just one barrier to get into a building 
can stop people (with disabilities) from 
going in.” Additionally, he clarified that 
the grounds services are responsible 
for maintaining any tactile blocks and 
crosswalks that are on campus. Despite 
a persistent and organized University 
grounds crew, uncontrollable weather 
becomes a main setback in their opera-
tions, and pristine tactile blocks, side-
walks and crosswalks may not always be 
promised.
“It’s pretty rare for someone to say 
good job to us,” he said. Regardless of 
the hard work and the long hours that 
the crew does put in, there are commut-
ers who still complain, not understand-
ing the ins and outs of the operation. To 
extend their services even further, they 
“created volunteer groups with students 
who now get paid.” “They go out to curb 
cuts and ramps that need more mainte-
nance,” Doletzky said.
During the interview, he reminded 
me of Ann Arbor’s four ice storms that 
happened in just four weeks this win-
ter. With the constant effort to eliminate 
slippery walkways, it would be almost 
impossible for everything to be ice-free.
“Do you know how much salt it would 
take for campus to never be slippery dur-
ing an ice storm?” he asked me over the 
phone. I was afraid to hear the answer.
“3,000 tons of salt for one day,” 

Doletzky said. “That’s how much salt we 
use in one season.” Additionally, through 
drainage and debris becomes a salt brine 
mixture that drifts into the Huron River 
and pollutes it. 
“The better job we do, there is an 
expectation that rises,” Doletzky said. 
More complaints plus more effort from 
the crew equals more equipment, mate-
rials and labor. In those scenarios where 
tons of machine energy and salt brine 
are being used, it becomes an negative, 
enviromental impact that is solely used 
to satisfy commuters and ensure safety 
on campus.
There is still a question of where 
the happy medium lies: How do we get 
enough snow plowed and shoveled that 
it isn’t overly laborious on workers or 
environmentally harmful, but is still 
accessible enough for the disabled com-
munity? These questions regarding win-
ter maintenance and accessibility seem 
to become more multi-faceted and chal-
lenging each step of the way. For those 
like Heinrich who eagerly need an active 
solution, the answers become frustrat-
ing and fuzzy. Pieces that are clear and 
understandable, however, are awareness 
and effort from all.
I

t is an unspoken truth that win-
ter in Ann Arbor will never be 
trouble-free. As Doletzky men-
tioned, even if sidewalks are pristine 
after cleaning and re-assuring its acces-
sibility for five hours, city snow plows 
can still come through at night and 
dump all that snow onto what once were 
snow-free sidewalks. There will be situa-
tions where sidewalks freeze, and some-
one will not be home until 5 p.m. to salt 
their sidewalk. These are all minor yet 
impactful situations that inevitably hap-
pen. Unfortunately, they become cyclical 
habits that we become accustomed to as 
a community.
Toward the end of our interview, I 
asked Heinrich what he thinks the solu-
tion to all of this is.
“It’s just people giving a shit,” Hein-
rich answered. After an hour and half 
interview, I could hear exhaustion in his 
voice. “People need to be less ignorant.”
“It’s all about universal accessibility,” 
he continued. “If you can make it good 
for people who are disabled, you can 
make it even better for everyone else.”
There isn’t exactly one answer or 
practice that will eradicate these issues. 
Factors like staffing, funding, timing, 
environmental impacts and overall com-
munication are key barriers in this situ-
ation. But what we know are the facts: 
Commuters with disabilities can’t get to 
their destination during winter, the city 
ordinances aren’t ideal for accessibility 
expectations and organizing the Uni-
versity grounds crew involves a complex 
system of considerations, and more mov-
ing parts than one may expect. And there 
are pieces to this puzzle that are held in 
the community’s hands.

Ann Arbor is commonly known for its 
progressive, liberal and open-minded 
nature. A place for leaders and the best 
with a highly-ranked position for high-
er-education institutions, artistic pur-
suits and athletics, the University is used 
to coming out on top. These practices of 
winter maintenance accessibility, how-
ever, don’t nearly fit the progressive 
model that the community tries to repre-
sent. Heinrich describes his experience 
of inaccessibility with a metaphor of 
Hatcher Graduate Library and its archi-
tectural design:
“The front entrance of Hatcher is a 
frame for the University,” he said. “It has 
these steps to go upwards, to gain access 
to knowledge and intelligence. And 
there’s a wheelchair ramp on the side … 
but the reality is that is not accessible. 
There is literally a sign that says ‘Not 
accessible by wheelchair.’”
“If you actually want to access the 
building (in a wheelchair), you have to 
go all the way around back to the one 
entrance,” Heinrich continued. “And 
that is such a physical manifestation of 
what this University has to say about 
accessibility: It’s not a priority. It’s show 
and tell.”
As a campus that ignited a Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion initiative for the 
“assurance of non-discrimination and 
equal opportunity for all persons in 
our community,” it’s clear after hearing 
Heinrich’s story and the story of so many 
others, the University is not granting 
that equal opportunity for all people in 
the community.
Only when we begin to acknowledge 
and understand those who have dif-
ficulty accessing this city and campus, 
can we then take a step forward in our 
practices towards a truly inclusive DEI 
initiative. Only when we decide to sit 
down and discuss more effective winter 
maintenance operations with the city 
administrators, can we then take a step 
forward in our practices toward a truly 
inclusive DEI initiative. Only when we 
decide to shovel/salt just a few extra feet 
of pavement–– the tactile-blocks, curb 
cuts and all of the in-betweens –– can we 
then take a step forward in our practices 
toward a truly inclusive DEI initiative. 
Whether you’re a student, faculty 
member, a business person, a townie or 
an elderly couple walking to your car 
downtown, we are all vital pieces to this 
solution.
While Heinrich still seeks a better 
future for the disabled community, he 
believes in a more accessible and more 
enjoyable city for everyone: “We need to 
better our city for everybody and recog-
nize that you (the city) have the ability 
to set better rules,” he said. “It’s not just, 
‘How do we make a better downtown 
for people who are disabled?’ but ‘How 
do we make winter downtown a more 
enjoyable experience for everyone?’”

The freedom of a fake account

M

y most liked picture on Ins-
tagram is from the day I got 
into college. The photo fea-
tures me walking down Hill Street past 
Ross on game day, decked out in Michi-
gan apparel. My head is turned to face the 
camera, offering a subtle closed-mouth 
smile. The caption read a simple, yet clev-
er, “going blue.” The post was fitting for 
the moment — I had dreamed of getting 
into the University of Michigan since I 
was a little girl. This picture perfectly, 
yet at the same time, nonchalantly, tried 
to capture the emotion of my acceptance. 
 
It looked natural. It looked effortless.
It was neither of those things.
I spent the beginning half of my high 
school years dreaming of what I would 
post if I got in. After I spending [COPY: 
“I spent” or just “After spending”] too 
much time thinking about it, I meticu-
lously crafted the cool, calm and collect-
ed caption that would go along with the 
meticulously chosen picture. It was stra-
tegically crafted for an audience — my 
Instagram followers— a random collec-
tion of friends, family and acquaintances 
who have access to my “life in pictures.”
But it wasn’t real.
Instead, my fake Instagram account 

(Finstagram for short) painted the real 
story. Finstagrams are people’s second 
private accounts. They often sport a lim-
ited number of followers, with the pur-
pose of this being to cap posts’ audience 
to the people the user knows and trusts. 
Since the content of these accounts is 
made to display embarrassing moments, 
it was the perfect platform for me to rant 
about the antics of my experience after I 
got into the University. 
It was tradition to wear college apparel 
the day after a senior commits to a school, 
and I wanted to show I was proud of what 
I had achieved. I wore a U-M hat, a U-M 
shirt and U-M socks to school. What I 
didn’t realize — yet in retrospect, prob-
ably should’ve — was that my hometown 
was infested with U-M alumni, always 
eager and ready to shout “Go Blue!” at 
any passerby sporting apparel. Random 
people screaming at me was not an action 
I was mentally prepared for.
In light of this, that day I posted a 
picture on my Finsta. My eyes were hid-
den by my left hand pulling my hat as far 
down on my face. My teeth were pressed 
together, with my lips pulled back to 
illustrate just how uncomfortable I was. 
The intense mood of the situation was 

secured with a black and white 
filter. The post was a cry for help 
out of my inherent awkwardness. 
The caption read:
“so i know saying go blue at 
random people wearing michi-
gan stuff is most definitely a 
thing but it’s happened so many 
times today and i genuinely don’t 
know what to do back. i freeze 
up every time. i forget that i have 
hands and they flail and my voice 
sounds like a broken cat it’s really 
cute”
The picture took one second to 
take. The caption took three to 
write.
Instead of spending hours 
tirelessly trying to construct the 
perfect post, I showed my 50 fol-
lowers who I actually was. In 
general, I don’t consider myself 
to be cool, but in those few days 
I was especially not calm. When 
I was being berated with spirit by 
strangers, I couldn’t even begin 
to consider myself collected. I 
was an awkward, excited mess, 
overwhelmed with good news 
and anxious for what the future 
would bring. My Finsta post 
showed that version of me.
It was genuine. It was real.
Finstagram is a fairly new con-
cept that came to my area when 
I was a freshman in high school. Insta-
gram itself created a platform in which 
people carefully create an identity to 
display to their followers, allowing for 
users to pick and choose what they want 
their peers to see through their posts. It 
was fueled by both pressure and a need to 
stand out. It promotes the chance to try 
to be as physically and aesthetically per-
fect as possible, as followers can’t really 
see how much time is spent on a post.
Instagram identities are not real iden-
tities, and many girls were done with fak-
ing it. So in direct backlash to Instagram’s 
pressure to fabricate, the fake Instagram 
(Finsta for short) [COPY: partway down 
the first page she writes “fake Instagram 
(Finstagram for short) so the repeated 
structure here seems a bit repetitive. 
Maybe just “the Finsta was born” cuz the 
reader already knows what a Finsta is at 
this point] was born.
Primary Instagram accounts allow 
insight into the user’s life for the pur-
pose of intriguing people who don’t 
know them better, while Finsta serves 
[COPY: Finstas serve? I’ve only 
heard people talk about Finstas in terms 
of Finsta accounts, not “Finstagram” as a 
whole] as a form of updating people who 

do. Finsta handles can range from being 
named after an inside joke with friends 
to a funny play-on-words of the user’s 
name. They’re quirky. They’re weird. 
They’re playful. Mine is named after my 
favorite rapper, while some of my friends’ 
usernames consist of weird declarations 
like @iwantsome_mashedpotatoes.
The content on these accounts is con-
stant. While I have been posting less and 
less recently due to a lack of free time, 
my Finsta was a platform for me to vent 
almost every day during my junior and 
senior year of high school. With stress 
induced by school, parents and some-
times even my friends, my account served 
as an outlet where I can let go. While Ins-
tagram showed me enjoying my “perfect” 
junior summer at the beach, looking as 
carefree as possible, my Finsta displayed 
the evident struggle behind the scenes. 
Instead of taking advantage of the weath-
er, I was cooped up in my town’s dull and 
cold library. All that was on my mind was 
finishing assignment after assignment. 
My Finsta followers understood this 
truth, with me writing:
“school hasn’t even started and it 
already fully consumes me. just when i 
thought i could celebrate for finishing 
parts of summer work i remembered 
that lang and italian still are fully dwell-
ing over my head. i swear lang is going to 
swallow me whole”
It was a popular sentiment that my 
surrounding rising seniors were relating 
to as well. That post received comments 
that reassured me I wasn’t alone in the 
process, and in a way, that was enough. 
That’s what the Finsta community is all 
about.
It pains me that we live in an era where 
our social media presence has such a 
large impact on how others perceive us. 
We’re reminded to always look good in 
our posts, but not like we’re trying too 
hard. Make sure the picture is natural, 
and that there’s a good setting to fit the 
mood. Never forget the perfect caption 
to show everyone just how witty we are, 
but not too witty — it makes us look weird 
if the caption seems too thought out. Do 
this, do that. Be this, be that. It’s too lim-
iting.
Instead of limiting myself, I found 
a platform that lacks restrictions and 
unsaid yet strictly followed rules. Maybe 
one day, I’ll let myself [COPY: be/feel?] 
completely free and delete my primary 
account in general, but for now, my Fin-
stagram makes me feel liberated. It sets 
me free from the useless pressure I feel to 
fit the wanted stereotype archetype.
My Finsta inspires my real identity.
