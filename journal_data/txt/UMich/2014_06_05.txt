LeVert, Bielfeldt recovering
from offseason surgery

After the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team lost three top players
to the NBA head- NOTEBOOK
iog ioto this sea-
son, junior guard
Caris LeVert is one of the only
returning key contributors.
Couple LeVert's length, shoot-
ingskills and defensive ability with
what should be an increased role
next season, and the expectations
are sky-high.
But first things first: LeVert must
1 recover from offseason surgery to
repair a stress fracture in his foot.
LeVert will miss the Kevin
Durant Skills Academy from June
27-29, but barring a setback, he
should be ready to go for the team's
trip to Europe in mid-August, said
Michigan coach John Beilein at a
press conference Tuesday.
"Obviously the surgery was a
success," Beilein said. "With some
of our players, we thought he is
such agrinder and he is in that gym
so longthat we didn't want to take
any chances. We expect him to be
fullgo probably by the beginning of
August, if not sooner."
Though Beilein won't be able to
prevent such injuries from occur-
ring in the future, he's taking
LeVert's injury as a guide to dealing
with such bumps moving forward.
"It's going to happen with some
people now and then, and it does
happen, a stress
fracture in the -
foot," he said. "It'll be a t
"We are really
being cautious, opportuni
and it's the right boy
thingto do.,,"
The only -
other player
limited by injuries is redshirt
junior forward Max Bielfeldt, who
had hip surgery after the season
ended. He will be out for most of
the summer, but Beilein said the
current plan is for him to be back
for the Europe trip.
In his absence, the thin Michi-
gan frontcourt - which lost Mitch
McGary to the NBA, Jordan Mor-
gan to graduation and Jon Horford
to a transfer - will be even thinner.
Though the injury might inhibit
the plans Beilein had for Bielfeldt
for the summer, it also enables
Beilein to perhaps better acclimate

incoming freshman Ricky Doyle
and redshirt freshman Mark Don-
nal to his system.
"Ricky (Doyle) and Mark Don-
nal are going to get a lot of mean-
ingful minutes over the summer,"
Beilein said. "If Max isn't back on
the trip, (it's) reallygood for them."
WHEN IN ROME: Beilein pro-
vided more details on the team's
trip to Europe, which will begin
Aug. 15. The team will be gone for
eight days and play four games in
Italy.
With such an inexperienced
team, Beilein expects improve-
ments out of several players. The
Wolverines lost four key contribu-
tors plus McGary, and just two
players - Bielfeldt and junior
guard Spike Albrecht - have more
than two years
of experience.
remendous "Max hasn't
had that type
ty for us to oftime,"Beilein
77 said. "Spike
nd. hasn't had that
much time, so
I think it'll give
us a great time to start at ground
zero and build everythingup again.
Obviously some will be ahead of
(others), but there's not veteran
seniors and a young class. Every-
body's pretty young."
Beilein has worked with sopho-
more guard Derrick Walton Jr.
about taking over more of the scor-
ing load this season with three
starters gone. He also believes
sophomore guard Zak Irvin could
make a similar improvement
to what Stauskas did last year,
expanding his game beyond perim-
eter shooting into a penetration

game.
Per NCAA rules, the team has
not traveled to Europe in four years.
In 2010, when the Wolverines took
a trip to Europe in the summer,
they made the second round of the
NCAA Tournament the following
year after missing out on the post-
season the previous year.
"We'll do some things on the
trip such as room the freshmen
with upperclassmen," Beilein said.
"(We) try and teach our culture
wherever we can. There's no cell
phones working, there's going to be
limited access to Internet, it'll be a
tremendous opportunity for us to
bond."
A FRESH START: For the third
time in four years, Michigan's lead-
ing scorer departed early for the
NBA, so the Wolverines will again
look to a deep freshman class to
contribute. This time, however, the
rebuilding process could be slower
- each of the previous two, Michi-
gan won the Big Ten the following
season.
In addition to forward Kameron
Chatman, who played in the Jor-
dan Brand Classic game and will
try out for Team USA's U18 team
next week, the Wolverines have
other recruits looking to make
an early impact. The Wolverines
added guards Aubrey Dawkins and
Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman
late in the process after they lost
players to the NBA.
Beilein also didn't rule out the
possibility of adding another player
with the last open scholarship he
has available. He didn't mention
names, but West Virginia transfer
Eron Harris has Michigan on his
visit list.

RGlasow
blew .11 after OWI

At least seven
others in car with
him, including
volleyball player
By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSports Editor
Redshirt junior center Gra-
ham Glasgow was charged with
operating a vehicle while intoxi-
cated on March 15, landing him
a suspension for part of spring as
well as the team's opener Aug. 30
against Appalachian State.
But there's a little more to that
story.
According to a police report
obtained by the Detroit Free Press
and Ann Arbor News via a Free-
dom of Information Act request,
Glasgow was driving a Chevro-
let Suburban around 8:30 p.m.
on March 15 near State and Wil-
liam Streets. He blew a .11 blood-
alcohol concentration at the scene
and a .13 at the Ann Arbor Police
Department Security Datamaster
room, both above the legal limit
of.08.
Glasgow told the police he'd
had five Natural Light beers since
3 p.m. He failed multiple sobri-
ety tests at the scene. He could
not concentrate when asked to
retrieve a number of items, stum-

bled when walking and could not
stand on one leg. Items were fall-
ing out of the trunk while the car
was moving.
"(Ann Arbor police officer Pat-
rick) Maguire could immediately
smell an overwhelming odor of
intoxicants coming from the driv-
er," the report stated, according to
the Ann Arbor News.
At least seven other passen-
gers were in the car, more than
the number of seatbelts. Glasgow
was pulled over by Maguire when
he allegedly noticed that senior
volleyball player Lexi Dannemi-
ller was in the passenger seat,
not wearing a seatbelt and hang-
ing out the window screaming at
pedestrians. Dannemiller, 20, was
charged with a minor in posses-
sion of alcohol and possession of
a fraudulent ID, that of fifth-year
senior rower Emily Idoni.
Glasgow was in Ann Arbor
District Court on Monday for his
pretrial hearing. At the request of
his attorney, John Shea, the hear-
ing was adjourned until June 16so
that a housekeeping matter could
be resolved. He was dismissed on
a $1,000 personal-recognizance
bond and cannot leave the state or'
consume alcoholuntil his hearing.
Former left tackle and 2014
NFL Draft pick Taylor Lewan will
also have his pretrial hearing for
two charges of aggravated assault
and one of battery that day.

RESEARCH
Researchers
find link
between
slut-shaming,
finances
Study of female
freshmen indicates
chasm between
social classes
By CAROLYN GEARIG
Daily StaffReporter
In Fall 2004, 55 women moved
into a floor of a dormitory at a large
public Midwestern university. Only
53 were students.
The other two were Sociol-
ogy Prof. Elizabeth Armstrong and
then-graduate student Laura Ham-
ilton, now teaching sociology at the
University of California-Merced.
The most surprising find-
ings centered on the intersection
between affluence and who was
slut-shamed - that is, who was
made guilty for their sexual activ-
ity.
Although Armstrong said all
of the girls "slut-shamed" equal-
ly, poorer girls were shamed by
wealthier girls for their sexual
behavior. Although wealthier girls
had more hookups than the other
girls, poorer women felt that they
could not get away with this behav-
ior without being shamed.
Hamilton and Armstrong spent
five years studying the attitudes,
habits and daily routines of the girls
on their floor. They spent extensive
time with the women during their
first year and interviewed them
annually from sophomore year to
post-graduation. Their findings
concluded with a book published
in April 2013, "Paying for the Party:
How College Maintains Inequal-
ity", and a study published in Social

Detroit Beat: Perspectives from policy conference

Leaders emphasize
link between Detroit
and Michigan
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. -
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan may
have been the most talked about
guy on Mackinac Island last week.
Early in the annual Mackinac
Policy Conference's second day,
Duggan was weaving down the
main promenade of the island's
Grand Hotel, fresh from his pri-
metime conference keynote the
day before.
Up and down the hotel's sweep-
ing porch and Media Row, jour-
nalists and business leaders were
angling for face time with Detroit's
chief executive. People were talk-
ing about Duggan - and they were
talking about Detroit.
Most every speech that followed
his keynote called out the mayor
by name. Duggan, who took office
earlier this year after a write-in
campaign propelled him to victory
in November, is often seen as the
face of Detroit's resurgence.
"He has a sense of urgency,"
author Malcolm Gladwell said in
his lecture atthe conference. "He's
in a hurry."

Duggan's prominence at the
conference signals an increased
spotlight on the city of Detroit,
even at a conference organizers
say was designed to more broadly
emphasize statewide issues com-
pared to previous years.
Brad Williams, vice president
of government relations at the
Detroit Regional Chamber, said
his organization tried to build a
conference that was also relevant
to the entire state. However, he
said conversations surrounding
Detroit wielded new energy this
year.
"This year I think it was dif-
ferent in that what's happening
in Detroit is so impactful to the
state of Michigan, particularly
this bankruptcy portion," Wil-
liams said. "That has an impact
statewide. So I think that's why
you heard so much more conver-
sation about Detroit this year and
because we have a new mayor, new
council leadership. There's lots of
energy and interest around the
city."
During the four-day gathering,
speakers made the case over and
over again that the state's future is
intertwined with Detroit's.
"It's not about Detroit ver-
sus Michigan," Gov. Rick Snyder
(R) said to a hall packed with the
state's most influential business
and political leaders. "I hope

Highlights from the 2014 softball season

Mayor Mike Duggan during an interview with the Michigan Daily at the Mackinac
Policy Conference Friday.

By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
When the 2014 season began,
feelings on the Michigan softball
team could have been described as
"Women's College World Series or
Bust." In the end, the Wolverines
didn't make the Women's College
World Series, but they weren't a
bust, either.
The Daily looks back on some
of the best memories and perfor-
mances from 2014.
MVP: Sierra Romero
The sophomore shortstop
entered the season already boast-
ing a Big Ten Player of the Year
award and a spot on the preseason
All-America team. Romero made
sure to end the season with far
more, earning nods as an All-
American, finalist for National
Player of the Year and Big Ten
Player of the Year, the latter for the
second straight year.
She had the nation's second-
highest batting average, .491, and
led the country in on base percent-

age at .633, all while smacking 18
home runs and 72 RBI. But Rome-
ro's real value to the team was her
knack for coming through when it
seemed no one else could, with the
plays only she could make.
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
lauded Romero for her "swag,"
admiring the way Romero carries
herself at the plate, in the field and
in the locker room.
Best win: Regional final over
Arizona State
No one would have blamed you
if you buried your face when Ari-
zona State catcher Amber Freeman
hit what appeared to be a walk-off
homer to beat the Wolverines in
the regional final. But, if you did,
you missed senior center fielder
Lyndsay Doyle's leaping catch at
the wall that sat atop SportsCen-
ter's Top 10 Plays for days to come.
Doyle said assistant coach Bon-
nie Tholl told her to "jump the
wall" just moments earlier, and she
followed the advice, rising up to
end the game and propel Michigan
into the Super Regionals.

That catch came minutes after
sophomore outfielder Sierra Law-
rence and senior designated player
Taylor Hasselbach hit back-to-back
home runs to tie the game and take
the lead, respectively.
Worst loss: 10-2 loss at Illinois
The Wolverines found them-
selves in plenty of mercy-rule
contests this season, but only once
were they on the wrongside of one.
That came on April 25, when lowly
Illinois trounced Michigan, 10-2,in
six innings.
Driesenga started the game in
the circle, but gave up six runs
on nine hits in 3.2 innings before
yieldingtoWagner,whowasn't any
better, giving up five hits and four
runs in 1.2 innings of work. From
the plate, the Wolverines were
just as bad, mustering just five hits
themselves, two of them off the bat
of Romero.
The game was indicative of a
larger struggle Michigan was fac-
ing, part of a streak in which it
lost four straight series openers to
conference foes. While no confer-

you're ready to stand up for the
settlement for Detroit, Michigan."
Snyder, who called for the
appointment of an emergency
manager, has been a vocal advo-
cate for state support of the city's
rejuvenation and bankruptcy pro-
cess.
on the heels of the conference,
he joined state and city officials in
calling on legislators in Lansing
to approve the city's "grand bar-
gain" - a deal that would provide
$195 million in state aid to the city.
The contribution would be cou-
pled with funds gifted by Detroit
Institute of Art benefactors and
local philanthropic organizations,
allowing the city to settle debts
with its pensioners and avoid the
sale of DIA art.
The package was approved
by both houses of the legislature
Tuesday and now awaits the gov-
ernor's signature and a vote of
approval by the city's pensioners.
Support from legislators across the
state - not just in the Metro area
- was necessary for the package of
bills to pass both houses.
More than ever, the city of
Detroit is shaping conversations
across the state and it's doing so in
new ways.
"I don't think we knew exactly
where we would be at this point
in history, but certainly as we got
closer (to the conference), we knew
the city would be a focal point of
the conversation," Williams said.
Jeanette Pierce, director of
community relations for D:hive, a
Detroit organization that provides
resources for people who are con-
sidering moving into the city, said
she noticed the discussion's addi-
tional emphasis on Detroit.
In previous years, Pierce said
she was frustratedby panel discus-
sions that brought in practitioners
from out-of-state. She said 75 per-

cent of the projects those speakers
touted were already going on in
Detroit.
"I think too often we kind of
look outside instead of looking
inside and I think the mayor ham-
mering that stuff home was really
part of that," she said.
Like D:hive, Duggan said his
administration's top priority is to
retain the city's existing popula-
tion and attract new residents.
"We get up everyday and we
focus on what we can do to reverse
the population decline in the city
of Detroit," he said in his keynote
address. "It governs every single
decision we make. We do not have
a future if we don't start growing."
Though thebmayor touted a
growing number of technology
jobs, Detroit-based artisans and a
burgeoning downtown and Mid-
town housing market, he said
he was not "under any illusions"
about the city's challenges. Dug-
gan said the city lost 12,000 in
population last year and the unem-
ployment rate remains two times
the state's average.
"I'm going to show you why it's
not hopeless," he told the audience
at the start of the address.
A major part of Duggan's plan
is revitalizing blighted neighbor-
hoods, rather than solely demol-
ishing abandoned homes. In the
presentation, Duggan highlighted
one neighborhood where 39 homes
were slated for demolition. He
said a new initiative - one that
would allow the city to seize and
auction abandoned homes if their
owners didn't get them fixed up
and occupied within six months
- has already jumpstarted tan-
gible changes in that neighbor-
hood. Now, only nine homes will
be demolished.

ence loss was a good one, this flop
against a bottom dweller has to be
considered the worst because of
the lopsided drubbing Michigan
received and the hopelessness it
exuded in the final innings.
Top freshman: Megan Betsa
With two strong junior pitchers
returning in right-hander Sara Dri-
esenga and lefty Haylie Wagner,
pitching was far from a concern
for the Wolverines entering the

season. That didn't stop Betsa from
earning a significant chunk of play-
ingtime.
Betsa finished the year 18-4,
posting a 2.25 ERA and a team-
high 150 strikeouts in 130.1 innings
pitched. Though she struggled
with confidence and composure
early in the season, Betsa worked
hard, sometimes on her days off, to
earn her playing time. She threw a
no-hitter against Detroit and ulti-
mately beat out Driesenga for the
No. 2 slot in the rotation.

Grading the Michigan softball team in 2014

By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSports Editor
The 2014 Michigan softball sea-
son opened with a 4-0 seventh-
inning lead that turned into a
9-4 extra-inning loss against the
eventual national champions. It
closed with a walk-off home run
in the deciding game of the Super
Regionals. In between, there were
22 run-rule games, 21 of which
the Wolverines won and many of
which could have been a lot more
lopsided if Michigan wanted to run
up the score.
But the season still had a flair for
the dramatic.
The Daily breaks down how
they stacked up overall.
Offense: A
Michigan's most effective unit
this year played a large role in its
success. The Wolverines were
among the best nationally in every
category: fifth in batting average,
second in on-base percentage,

ninth in scoring and 16th in slug-
ging.
They had speed, with senior slap
hitters Lyndsay Doyle and Nicole
Sappingfield setting the table at
the top of the lineup. And they had
power, with sophomore shortstop
Sierra Romero and senior designat-
ed player Taylor Hasselbach lead-
ing the team in home runs.
Michigan lost five times in the
last three weeks of the regular sea-
son, and in those losses, it scored
just 13 runs. But after splitting the
Big Ten title with Nebraska, the
Wolverines heated up again, mov-
ing to the brink of the Women's
College World Series.
Defense: A-
Michigan's defense made the
most significant strides from last
year, when it was the team's weak-
est unit.
Of course, the biggest highlight-
reel play was the one that ended up
on the highlight reel - SportsCen-
ter's Top 10. With two outs in the

seventh inning of a decisive region-
al game, senior center fielder Lynd-
say Doyle made a leaping catch at
the wall to rob a would-be game-
winning home run. The Wolver-
ines finished eighth in the nation
in fielding percentage and will
return three full-time starters in
the infield next year.
Pitching: B+
At times during the first half of
the season, this looked like Michi-
gan's strongest unit. Junior left-
hander Haylie Wagner kept her
earned-run average under 1.00 for
most of the season, returning to
top form after an injury limited her
down the stretch last season.
Late in the season, however, the
pitching was not on the elite level
it needed to be. Wagner carried the
load and was solid, but in the end,
she couldn't match zeroes with
Waldrop in the deciding game, a
4-2 loss. For most of the season,
the Wolverines' staff of three good
pitchers was their strength: They

usually started one game each
weekend and kept them fresh. In
the NCAA Tournament, Michigan
needed one tostep up and be on top
ofhergame, and none ofthemtruly
was.
Final Grade: B+
When Michigan brought back
seven starters plus Driesenga, last
year's ace, from a team that went to
the Women's College World Series
last year, expectations were high.
For most of the season, the Wolver-
ines lived up to them. They knocked
off five ranked teams in the non-
conference season and strung
together a dominant 20-game win
streak that put them in the driver's
seat in the Big Ten race.
But then they stumbled a few
times. A loss to Minnesota in the
Big Ten Tournament final shipped
them off to Tempe, Ariz. for the
regional round of the NCAA Tour-
nament.
There, Michigan took care of
business, winning two one-run

elimination games to advance in
thrilling fashion.
But they couldn't get further.
Shut down by Waldrop to the tune
of two runs in two games, Michi-
gan's season ended in Tallahassee,
Fla. Though it featured many high-
lights, the Wolverines took a step
back from last year, leaving some
business unfinished in 2014.

Baseball: Report Card

Baseball prospects
await draft fates

By ZACH SHAW
Daily Sports Writer
The final opinion of Michigan
baseball's 2014 campaign is com-
pletely in the eye of the beholder.
There was a second consecutive
winning season, the first 30-win
season since 2010 and an under-
classman core that looks to lead the
program for years to come.
But there were also excruciat-
ing losses in every way imaginable,
another season middling in the Big
Ten and a sixth straight failure to
make the NCAA Tournament.
The Daily makes sense of the
highs and lows of the season, hand-
ing out final grades for the Wolver-
ines.
Offense: B-
The bats proved to be the Wol-
verines' biggest weakness most
of the season. Hitting just .256 as
a team and scoring just 4.42 runs
per game, the offense wasted many
solid pitching efforts - nine of
Michigan's 29 losses came when the

team allowed three runs or fewer.
There were highlights, of course,
as the Wolverines tacked on 10 hits
or more 16 times and piled on 18
runs against Northwestern on May
3, and ranked second in the Big
Ten with 81 stolen bases. But when
it came down to it, the inability to
keep innings alive (Big Ten-leading
355 strikeouts) or score against top
pitching (just 2.92 runs per game in
series-openinggames) led to Mich-
igan's demise.
Defense: B
Freshman outfielder Jackson
Lamb made SportsCenter with his
diving catches, sophomore Jacob
Cronenworth flashed the leather all
over and juniors Eric Jacobson and
Kyle Jusick solidified the right side
of the infield withzero errors in 439
chances. The Wolverines were solid
on defense for much of the season,
tying for fourth in the conference
with a.972 fielding percentage.
But the errors Michigan did
make proved to be costly. Five
errors in its opening doubleheader

Feb. 14 caused the Wolverines to
blow leads in back-to-back losses.
Three late-game errors cost Michi-
gan a game against Minnesota
April 4. And six errors commit-
ted against Notre Dame on April
9 marked infamy unlikely to be
matched by any Wolverine team
past or future.
Pitching: A-
Michigan's greatest strength,
the pitching staff, was third in the
Big Ten with a 3.21 ERA and tal-
lied 30 more strikeouts than any
other team. Showing the ability
to contain even top offenses, the
Wolverine pitchers kept their team
in many games it had no business
being in.
The freshmen led the way, going
12-3 with 2.73 earned-run average
in 112 innings. In total, Michigan
will return its top nine pitchers in
earned-run average next season,
providing promise for another
strong year on the mound.
Overall: B
This team was not expected
to win a national title, nor was it
expected to be below .500 until
May 11. Consistency proved to be a
major problem for the Wolverines,
but the talent showed up frequently
enough to tie for fourth in the Big
Ten.
The expectations will be higher
with another top-20 recruiting
class and up to 27 of 32 players
returning next season. But for now,
being the fourth-best team in the
Big Ten can only be seen as a minor
disappointment.

Szkutnik, Bourque,
Glines top juniors
with draft hopes
Thursday
By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
As the Michigan baseball sea-
son comes to an end, the program
is going to have to face a nagging
issue: Which draft-eligible play-
ers are going to leave to play pro-
fessionally?
Including graduating players,
there are 16 members from the
2014 team that could be selected
in the MLB Draft, which takes
place on Thursday. Eligible play-
ers include graduating high-
school players, those who have
completed their junior season
in college and players that have
used four years of eligibility.
Michigan's top prospects to
leave early are junior left-hander
Trent Szkutnik and junior right-
hander James Bourque.
Each has qualities that stand
out in big-league systems, but
they will have to weigh the pros
and cons between returning for
their senior years and starting
their professional careers.
Szkutnik is believed to havethe
highest draft potential. Boasting
a low-'90s fastball, a bevy of off-
speed pitches and a stellar pick-
off move to first base, he started
some games this season in front
of more than 10 scouts.
He put up a solid 3.38 earned-
run average and led the Wol-
verine pitching staff on a late
tear to finish with a 3.21 team
ERA. Accompanying his on-field
results were visible leadership
traits on a team that was short of
senior leaders.
The other pitcher who is get-
ting attention from scouts is
Bourque. Scouts kriew his name
coming into this season after he
struck out 53 hitters over 58.1
innings in his sophomore cam-
paign. This year, his ERA went
down by nearly a point, and the
strikeout rate held fairly con-
stant. With a fastball topping
out at around 96 miles per hour,.
Bourque's is considered one of

the top arms in the program.
Another possible loss for the
Wolverines' roster is center field-
er Jackson Glines. The junior
posted a .332 batting average,
which was the best on the team
and good for seventh in the con-
ference. This was his first year
playing Division I baseball after
he transferred to Michigan from
Fresno City College before this
season. ~
As the threat of losing key
players from this year's fifth-
place team in the Big Ten looms,
the Wolverines have to begin to
look toward next year.
On the mound, Michigan will
return at least three of its four
starters from the Big Ten Tour-
nament, including the righty-
lefty freshman combo of Keith
Lehmann and Brett Adcock -
which combined to go 11-5 with a
2.82 earned-run average with 93
strikeouts in their first season.
Joining them will be sopho-
more left-hander Evan Hill, who
rounds out a weekend trio. If
Szkutnik decides to return for
his senior season, all four will
combine to form a solid rotation
heading into the 2015 campaign.
In relief, the Wolverines bring
back their top nine pitchers in
earned-run average and will
reintroduce junior right-hander
Matt Ogden to the staff. Ogden,
who missed the entire season due
to injury, led the 2013 squad with
an 8-1 record and a 2.28 earned-
run average.
In the field, things look equal-
ly promising. The only starter
graduating is catcher Cole Mar-
tin, and Glines is the only other
position player who might enter
the draft. That leaves 14 play-
ers who appeared in at least 20
games, and roughly 80 percent
of total offense will be back next
year.
After the draft, there will be a
better picture of what the roster
will look like next season, as it
will be clear which players will
be leaving for professional ball
along with the announcement of
the incoming recruiting class.

FILM

for his own individual directorial
projects, which he plans to pursue
in the future.
The SAC department's empha-
sis on writing grew with the
acquisition of the Orson Welles
and Robert Altman collections,
Burnstein said. The Sayles collec-
tion will be joining both of these
archives.
Phil Hallman, Film Studies
field librarian and curator for
the Screen Mavericks at Michi-
gan Collection, said he hopes
to expand the archives. Includ-
ing Sayles' work in the collection
marks a significant step in this
direction.
"The hope is to create a center
for the study of independent film-
making at the University of Michi-
gan," Hallman said. "All of these
filmmakers have worked outside
of the traditional Hollywood sys-
tem."
Students from Professor Mark
Kligerman's American Inde-
pendent Cinema (SAC 455) class
viewed numerous Sayles films.
Their next assignment was to
organize his work in a way that
would be accessible to scholars -
a hands-on endeavor they pursued
throughout the duration of the

Winter 2014 semester.
Screen Arts & Cultures junior
Katherine Sherry, a student in SAC
455, addressed the audience, dis-
tinguishing her experience from
that of other classes.
"So many times, you do the
paper, you turn it in and it's a
checkmark," Sherry said. "This
has been an opportunity to really
learn and it's been kind of what
education should be. The actual
primary documents is something
far more important anything that
we see in a lecture or textbook."
Melissa Gomis, an Instructional
Technology librarian at Hatcher,
played a large role in organizing
and designing the exhibit and fre-
quently met with both students
from 455 and Hallman to discuss
progress.
Gomis said the project itself,
given the time span allowed for
completion, was very ambitious,
but its universal message will
make the effort worthwhile.
"Whether you're doing some-
thing that's visual or more textual,
you're trying to tell a story and I
think the story he's (Sayles) tell-
ing has a lot of universal appeal,"
Gomis added. "There's a lot of
humanity in them and I think
that's something that you don't
always see in films and it's some-
thing I wasn't expecting to see."

SLUT-SHAMING
From Page 1
Psychology Quarterly that focused
on slut-shaming.
Some of their findings aren't
shocking: money-related factors
like income, debt, social con-
nections and parental financial
assistance hugely altered future
success. More surprising was that
economic factors skewed how the
women interpreted each others'
sexual activities and attractive-
ness, as well as their overall values
on sex.
Armstrong and Hamilton
found that the three pathways
and other financially-related fac-
tors influenced the girls' views on
sex and each other. While they
asked direct questions and inter-
viewed all of the 53 girls, they also
learned through observing argu-
ments, gossip and late-night talks.
Economic inequality was often a
basis in the ways girls judged each
other's sexual pursuits. Label-
ing someone a "slut," which was
often combined with accusations
of meanness or unattractiveness,
seemed to be the worst insult.
Although Armstrong's research
involved dividing the women into
two groups of higher and lower
income, this seemed to happen
naturally because of expensive and
divisive social activities like Greek
life.
At the unnamed Midwestern

university, Greek life was "a really
big thing," Armstrong said. Soror-
ity rush was competitive, based
heavily on affluence and appear-
ance, and Greek life was also
expensive.
"A girl was in a very good soror-
ity and she said, 'Yeah, this poor
girl got in and was all wrong,"'
Armstrong said. "'She deactivated
of course because she didn't fit,
and she wasn't cute, you know? She
didn't belong."'
A lower-income student told
Hamilton and Armstrong, "Soror-
ity girls are kind of whorish and
unfriendly and very cliquey. If
you weren't Greek, then you didn't
really matter."
The study did not find that all
affluent women could fit into these
worlds - studious, "nerdy" girls
didn't fit in either even if they were
from well-off families.
"The social groups were very,
very divided by class," Armstrong
said.
Armstrong also noticed differ-
ing attitudes between the groups
in regards to sex. The wealthier
viewed casual sex in a negative
light only when it involved vaginal
intercourse, yet casual ofal sex and
kissing outside of a relationship
were acceptable behavior.
Less affluent girls equated slut-
tiness with the materialism and
cliquey behavior they thought
wealthier students embodied.
Women in the lower-income group
were unaware that the affluent

students' definition of hooking up
excluded vaginal intercourse and
believed that sex and hookups
belonged only in a steady relation-
ship.
However, the lower-income
girls were associated with the very
traits that higher-income girls
thought were "slutty," suggesting
that, in reality, it was the inability
to appear as if they were from a
high social class.
Halfway through college, none
of the 53 girls in Armstrong's study
had close friendships with those of
a different socioeconomic status.
Slut-shaming was everywhere,
but no one had concrete defini-
tions of what exactly a slut was, or
real evidence of the slutty behavior
causing this label to be put upon
girls.
"One of the things I think is
good that we found is that a slut
label didn't stick in a real kind of
long term way," Armstrong said.
"The sexual reputations weren't
very stable. There wasn't really
anyone who got permanently
labeled the floor slut or anything
like that. Among these women that
just didn't happen."
Armstrong said for the label to
have long-term consequences, it
would have to have more perma-
nent implications.
"It was combined together with
a lot of other factors related to
social class that had pretty major
consequences," Armstrong said.

the city see through the struggles
and find a wealth of opportunity.
People like QuickenLoans
founder Dan Gilbert have already
been heavy contributors to the
rebuilding efforts of the city,
working toward creating a stable
economy and fully' livable town.
Just last month, JP Morgan
Chase announced a $100 million
investment into the city. The money
is divided amongseveral categories,
the largest of which providing $50
million to community development
and $25 million to addressing the
city's blight situation. The full plan
illustrates abroad initiative banking
on a prosperous future for the city.
"We believe in Detroit," John
Carter, president of the JP Morgan
Chase Michigan Middle Market,
said. Carter said the money is
intended ' to serve the city in
the long term and is part of the
company's effort to be a "good,
corporate citizen."
"For us, the return truthfully is

down the line," he added. "It will be
measured by an improved Detroit.
We'll have more residents, more
businesses, more consumers and,
as a bank, ultimately we're goingto
benefit in that environment."
Carter said much of the money
is philanthropic, not an investment
in the sense of an expected dollar
amount. As for the companies that
can't afford to wait for a full city
recovery, Carter said there's plenty
to be excited about in Detroit.
In fact, the distribution of the
$100 million touches upon most all
of the major areas Detroit has to
be excited about. There are $12.5
million going to strengthening
the workforce and job training, $7
million going to small businesses
and $5.5 million towards future
economic growth, all areas the city
is working toward bolstering in the
effort to create long-term economic
stability.

Why I hate religion

New Maleficent still just a fairytale

Supporting social science
Congress must consider social sciences' importance with budget creation
Last Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved
legislation to increase the National Science Foundation's
budget to $7.4 billion for the 2015 fiscal year, a 3.2 percent
increase against the Obama administration's proposed increase
of 1.1 percent. However, before the appropriations bill was passed,
an amendment was added by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to
specifically cut NSF funding for social sciences research. While
it's commendable that the House has increased NSF funding
more than two times the proposed increase, redirecting funds
away from the social sciences is a mistake. When reviewing the
bill, the Senate must keep in mind the importance of research in
social sciences and its impact on society.

The greatest form of human
freedom - and the basis for all
of our other rights - is the free-
dom of thought.
The right to,
believe whatever
we choose is the
fundamental
foundation to speak,
associate and act
freely. Freedom
of thought gives JAMS
birth to new ideas BRENNAN
and challenges the
status quo, allowing
human beings the
courage to resist tyranny and formulate
new solutions to the world's problems.
Our right to think freely is what incites
us to speak when we're supposed to be
silent, to love when we're supposed to
feel indifference and to do that which
was thought to be impossible.
As a writer and vocal critic of
anything and everything I dislike, the
freedom to think and express my beliefs
is a constant source of deep personal
fulfillment. I can say with confidence
that I love my right to think and say
whateverv I want more than almost
anything in my life. I love it more than
any material good, more than any object
of sentimental value and more than
any person. When you love something
that much, it's logical that you would
absolutely hate anything that threatens
its existence.
I hate religion because it jeopardizes
all of our most treasured civil liberties
at their root: the freedom of thought.
Religion requires an individual to
suspend critical thinking and abstain
from any questioning of dogma, often
enforced through the threat of eternal
damnation, the promise of endless .
paradise or both. If one does notbelieve,
he orshehas committed anunforgivable
crime worthy of punishment. If one
breaks any of the religion's rules, he
or she has compromised their fate.
In some cases, if one even so much
as thinks an impure thought, his or
her destiny is in peril. Religion isn't
salvation, it's an Orwellian nightmare
enforcing thought crimes.
The bookNineteenEighty-Four opens
with its protagonist Winston Smith
hiding in the corner of a room out of
the view of Big Brother, scribbling his
thoughts nervouslyinto ajournal. If he's
caught, he faces imprisonment or death.
Religion takes away even that corner
where Winston can hide.
In a 1969 opinion, Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote, "If
the First Amendment means anything,
it means that a State has no business
telling a man, sitting alone in his own
house, what books he may read or

what films he may watch." Religion .
takes ,away not only the bastion of
freedom in one's own home, but the
most valuable space for freedom that
exists: one's own mind.
Religion isn't a law that we are
all required to follow. It is, in fact,
protected by the very freedom I value
so much. If a person wants to filter
all of their thoughts and actions to
appease something they believe in,
even if it's something silly, that's
their choice. Adults are free to lock
themselves into refusing dissent and
obeying what Christopher Hitchens
labeled "a celestial North Korea." But
what about children?
Kids often have religion drilled into
their heads by their parents as soon
as they're able to understand, making
it nearly impossible to later bore out.
While religion is the willful suspension
of critical thinking for adults, it's a
command for children who don't know
any better to ask certain questions.
Grown adults are free to give away their
freedom of thought, but some children
are required to do so before they can
make the choice themselves.
To be clear, I'm not advocating for
the prohibition of all religion by law.
Nor do I fail to recognize that some
religions are far better in this respect
than others, some of whom hold very
few unquestionable tenants. What
I'm saying is that rules on what you
choose to think, say and do should
not be restricted by an illogical desire
to pacify a mythic higher power.
A person doesn't need to defer to a
hierarchy that supposedly punishes
"bad" thoughts to decide what is and
isn't good to contemplate.
While I love my own freedom of
thought, what I love more is everyone
else's. A democratic society is built on
a free exchange of ideas, an exchange
unfiltered and filled with criticism and
creativity. Progress is driven by new
ideas, unconventional wisdom and,
above all else, dissent.
Religion destroys a person's ability
to fully think for him or herself, in turn
destroying their ability to decide their
own path in life. On a large scale, it can
hinder progress for the rest of society.
I understand that religion can be
comforting; it offers a person concrete
meaning in life, explains what happens
when it's all over and gives someone
hope they may see their loved ones
again after they die. What it asks for in
exchange is a person's surrender oftheir
faculties to think and act freely.
If you ask me, that sounds like a deal
with the devil.

In March, President Barack
Obama and his administration
submitted the 2015 fiscal year
budget to Congress for review.
The proposal included a 1.1
percent increase in the fiscal
year budget for the NSF. When
reviewing the budget proposal,
the House decided to increase
the NSF's budget 2.3 percent
more than proposed by the
Obama administration. As the
NSF redirects more than one-
fourth of the federal support
to academic institutions, it's
imperative the foundation be
well-funded.
While an increased
budget benefits the NSF, an
amendment to redirect social
science research towards
natural science inhibits the
NSF's autonomy. Amendment
proponents assert that natural
science research significantly
outvalues social science

research, but this notion
doesn't account for the arduous
process to receive funding.
Those interested in NSF grant
money must submit extensive
proposals to a committee and
receive approval before given
funds. Over 40,000 proposals
for research, education and
training projects are received
by the NSF each year with only
11000 proposals accepted.
Given their experience in
scientificfields, members ofthe
selection committee are better
qualified than congressman to
analyze whether research is
worth of investment.
The committee contains
valid reasoning for supporting
social science research.
Proponents of more science
research cite that natural
science constitutes research
that is "necessary for economic
growth." While natural science

deserves substantial funding,
this shouldn'tundervalue social
science research. Scholars at
Rice University studied public
reactions to natural disasters,
and this information has been
used to aid evacuation plans
for future emergencies. Smith
argues that some research
money, like $50,000 to study
17th century Peruvian lawsuits,
could be redirected, so the NSF
should provide reasoning for
the research's value. While the
committe is qualified to make
funding decisions, it's possible
that a few of the 11,000 yearly
proposes could be efficiently
redirected. However, if money
is to be redirected, it could be
beneficial to both social science
and natural science research.
If money is taken from social
science funding, it should be
redirected towards others
areas of social science research.

he decides to betray Maleficent to
even after the deed is done.
The ending of "Maleficent"
attempts to subvert the fairytale
genre a la Disney's last blockbuster
"Frozen" (2013). I won't spoil any-
thing, but I will tell you that the
subversion feels tired. Expected.
Anti-climactic. Only there because

it's trendy and hip and another ban-
ner feverishly waving for House
Feminism. Am I giving too much
away? The thing is, despite a poten-
tially refreshing trope inversion in
the name ofgirl power, every female
in "Maleficent" is still romanti-
cally attached to a guy. Their major
character points revolve around
romance. In the context of the rest
of the film's traditional, ye-olde-
fairytale atmosphere, a new spin
almost feels forced - and it doesn't
help that one of the side characters
literally looks into the camera to
clarify the twist.

Michael and Harvey have a moment
ktor can be thrown into a room
with another and it will be a
strong scene. This is especially
true for the characters of Jessica
Pearson (the impeccable Gina
Torres, "Firefly") and Donna
Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty, "What if
God Were The Sun"). Each scene
the two share together peels back

a new layer in their partnership
and friendship.
Ultimately, despite the amount
of exposition and the familiar
storyline, the season premiere of
"Suits" features the fun character
interactions from a great ensem-
ble that lead to it being the per-
fect summer diversion.

From Page 7
beef brisket, spicy pork, and mari-
nated short rib. By cooking them
one at a time, and having only a few
people, you'll be able to savor each
one without getting too competi-
tive. I recommend eating the bris-
ket first. The thin slices, which my
friend compared to bacon made of
beef, are best when lightly seared
and then dipped in a little ramekin
of salt and sesame oil - it's a won-
derful mouthful of umami. For the
spicy pork and short rib, you should
cut off small pieces and lay them
a few at a time on the grill. Please,
for god's sake, wait until they're
cooked. Commit yourself to this
protein power-hour, and you'll be
rewarded with the flavor of charred
fat and caramelized marinade that
only comes when high-quality
meat is cooked over high heat. The
included sides (cabbage salad and
white rice) and sauces (sesame oil,
miso and chili paste) shouldn't be
overlooked either.
You really should get barbecue.
But if that's not your bag, the offer-
ings from the kitchen are stellar.
For a starter, try the sweet potato
noodles, which are like rice noodles
but much earthier and chewier,
and sauteed with sesame oil, veg-
etables and beef. For a main course,
bibimbop is always a good option.
Tomukun's version is lighter and
fresher than most in Ann Arbor,
served with fresh bean sprouts and
mushrooms, and of course, a runny
egg.
There's still much on the menu
I would have liked to try, like the
"Army Stew" hot-pot, which serves
eight people and contains a smor-
gasbord of cross-cultural items like
hot dogs, ramen noodles and rice
cakes. But what I did experience,
and must take time to complement,
is the absolutely superb service at
Tomukun. Every server is not only
knowledgable about the minutiae
of the menu, but also extremely
helpful in guiding you through the
occasionally confusing, even nerve-
wracking, task of cooking your own
food.
Going to Tomukun Korean Bar-
becue for dinner isn't exactly a
relaxing experience. It requires
commitment, patience, and even a
sense of humor about yourself. It's
expensive, and the wait for a table
can be maddening. You won't pop
in for a quick dinner. But that's not
what Tomukun Korean Barbecue
is about. It's an experience - an
exciting, new, usually delicious and
never boring experience.

"We actually see this ... as the
Super Bowl of climate politics."
This is what Peter Altman of the
Natural Resources Defense Council
said with regards to President
Barack Obama's new climate
change plans.
According to reports, President
Obama is planning to cut carbon
emissions by as much as 30 percent
through new regulations unveiled
earlier this week.
But, the question remains: is it
really the "Super Bowl"?
For Americans, this may seem
like the Super Bowl. In reality,
President Obama and the United
States are playing a game of catch-
up, as governments around the
world have implemented similar
programs for years. This is a step
forward, but key components of
climate change reform are not
being considered, which must be
resolved before it's too late.
Firstly, the Obama
administration's plan is limited in
scope, as it only addresses carbon
dioxide emissions. While carbon
dioxide lasts in the atmosphere
for a longer period of time, other
greenhouse gases such as methane
and nitrous oxide are better than
carbon dioxide at trapping heat,
meaning that they can have a
larger impact on the climate in the
short-term. The Environmental
Protection Agency estimates that
"the comparative impact of CH4
(methane) on climate change is
over 20 times greater than CO2
over a 100-year period." Until these
gases are included, the Obama
administration may not be able to
effectively mitigate the negative
impacts of greenhouse gases.
Furthermore, this move may
make alternative energies appear
more attractive going forward.
However, certain types of energy
sources haven't been proven to
be reliable commodities. Along
with the cost of production and
maintenance, intermittency is
always an issue for alternative
energy sources such as solar since
one cannot control the supply of
sunlight. Adequate storage isn't
available, particularly for solar,
which can create imbalances for
the electricity grid and possible
voltage fluctuations, as Rob Wile of
Business Insider explains.
And of course, there will be short-
term economic consequences. Coal
companies have said that new

carbon emissions standards will
negatively impact job growth and
the ability to provide affordable
electricity. The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce found in a report that
GDP could decrease by $50 billion
dollars annually, in addition to the
loss of 224,000 jobs. Additionally,
technologies such as carbon capture
and sequestration are expensive
for companies to implement in the
short-term. Before we do anything,
we must find ways to fill in the gaps
in the short-term.
As Christina Romer mentioned
in an article in The New York Times
from 2012, this economic loss may
call for government intervention
to help mitigate some of the short-
term costs:
"Today, we face a profound short-
fall of demand (in terms of jobs). That
truly is a terrible market failure, and
it warrants government intervention.
But we need actions that raise overall
demand - like a tax cut for house-
holds so they have more take-home
pay to spend, more aid to troubled
state and local governments, and
public investments in infrastructure.
These are all things that President
Obama has advocated."
Having this money to spend will
help create jobs in other sectors
of the economy, thus reducing the
impact of the reduction in carbon
emissions.
In addition to these solutions,
Obama's plan includes the
development of a cap-and-trade
system, which attempts to allow
companies to buy and sell permits
to pollute. If you look at cap-
and-trade programs, such as the
European Trading System from
around the world, some° of them
have only seen varying degrees of
success. The main issue with this
is to find a cap on pollution that
will still allow firms to produce at
levels in which the cost of reducing
pollution less painful economically.
And as the cap shrinks, companies
and the U.S. economy as a whole
will need to make sure that such a
system will not hinder investment
and economic growth.
The bottom line is that we still
have a long way to go to create
environmental policies that can
adequately handle the economic
challenges that the U.S. is
currently facing.
Paul Sherman is a

problematic.
Because,
if there's
anything that says, "We don't
want the general public anywhere
near us," it's holding a policy
conference on an island - an
all too perfect metaphor for the
disconnect between the Michigan
government and its citizens.
The Mackinac Policy
Conference has been held every
year since 1981 at the Grand
Hotel and is hosted by the Detroit
Regional Chamber. This year,
it ran May 27 through May 30.
According to the DRC's website,
the purpose of the conference is
to join "business professionals,
government leaders, CEOs,
entrepreneurs and regional
champions to strategically
position Michigan as a national
economic leader."
I find this mission statement
to be highly misleading. The goal
of "strategically position(ing)
Michigan as a national economic
leader" certainly did not pass
the eye test unless socializing,
participating in many interviews,
and sitting through several
keynote presentations counts as
policy-making.Perhaps"vacation"
would be more appropriate. That
being said, I find a gathering
like this has the potential to be
something spectacular. Just a few
changes (read: drastic overhaul)
are needed.
There were three main
"pillars" to this year's
conference: entrepreneurship,
STEM education and impact.
Throughout the week, keynote
speakers including Detroit Mayor
Mike Duggan, Malcolm Gladwell,
Gov. Rick Snyder, Purdue
University President Mitch
Daniels and Detroit Emergency
Manager Kevyn Orr presented in
line with these topics. The future
of Detroit was a major focus.

Law Prof. Julian Mortenson,

when these marriages occurred,
it was unequivocally legal for

Though it is difficult to find
constitutionality with same-

same-sex marriage in Michigan

uncertain. However, Mortenson
said he firmly believes in the

in Caspar v. Snyder, saying the
law does not allow anyone to take
away the rights of people who
married validly.
"We believe, quite strongly,
thatbanson marriage equalityare

regardless of whether they are
