Schlissel’s second 

ice cream social caps 
off Welcome Week 

festivities

By ISOBEL FUTTER 
and GEN HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporters

Weathering 
some 
light 

sprinkles of rain, about 1,200 
University students, faculty, staff 
and parents gathered for an ice 
cream social at the President’s 
House on Saturday.

Attendees, 
who 
had 
the 

chance to explore the first floor 
of the residence, were also given 
the opportunity to meet and 
snap pictures with University 
President Mark Schlissel and his 
wife, Monica Schwebs.

Students were invited to the 

event, which offered ice cream 
bars, cookies, water and apple 
cider. 
Schlissel, 
who 
dressed 

down in a block ‘M’ polo shirt, 
greeted those willing to wait in 

line for a chance to shake his 
hand.

The social, which began in the 

1930s when Florence Ruthven, 
wife of seventh president of 
the University, began hosting 
tea parties for female students. 
During the 1950s, University 
President Harlan Hatcher opened 
the event to all students. Since 
then, the social has been an 
annual event.

Open to both parents and 

students, the backyard of the 
house filled up quickly as students 
meandered around the gardens, 
munching on homemade block-
’M’ cookies and ice cream.

Last year was the first year 

Schlissel hosted. Many students 
who attended this year were 
excited to meet the relatively new 
president.

“It was cool to talk to him, 

because he’s still new,” LSA junior 
Alaina Stevenson said. “It’s nice 
to put a personality to a face and 
a name.”

communications 
on alcohol missing 

needed context

By MICHIGAN DAILY

who has this position

In a brief August 25 e-mail 

to all University students, E. 
Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, announced 
the University will implement 
“additional strategies” in its 
continuous effort to reduce 
students’ alcohol consumption. 
The widely publicized pilot 
program will notify parents of 
first-year students under the 
age of 21 who receive a second 
alcohol or drug violation, or 
“a violation accompanied by 
other serious behavior such 
as needing medical attention, 
significant property damage or 
driving under the influence.” 
Harper also wrote that the 
University of Michigan Police 

Department 
and 
the 
Ann 

Arbor 
Police 
Department 

will collaborate further on 
outreach efforts. Though the 
ultimate goal is to have joint 
jurisdiction 
in 
off-campus 

student neighborhoods, UMPD 
will initially “provide early 
engagement and feedback to 
students to help them better 
understand how to avoid being 
in violation of alcohol laws.” 
How these strategies will be 
put into practice remains to be 
seen. 

It is understandable that 

the e-mail was concise, for 
if it were longer it may have 
gone unread. But that came at 
the price of omitting critical 
information, 
as 
discovered 

in a recent Michigan Daily 
interview 
with 
University 

officials. A subsequent article 
published by the University 
Record on Sep. 1 also failed 
to provide full details. In 
the 
interview, 
University 

officials explained first and 
foremost that these changes

Under a proposed collabora-

tion with the Ann Arbor Police 
Department, officers with the 
University’s Division of Public 
Safety and Security could have 
joint authority to police off-
campus neighborhoods heavily 
populated by students.

The initiative is one com-

ponent of a set of recently 
announced University efforts 
designed to curb alcohol abuse at

basis

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

A week after unveiling a 

plan to involve the parents of 
first-year students following 

violations of University alco-
hol policies, administrators say 
the new protocol will be imple-
mented on a case-by-case basis 
— not uniformly.

In an exclusive conversation 

with The Michigan Daily on 
Wednesday, University higher-
ups provided further details, 
and framed the new directive as 
a matter of health and wellness.

E. Royster Harper, vice pres-

ident of student life; Mary Jo 
Desprez, director of Wolverine 

Wellness; and Eddie Washing-
ton, executive director of the 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security, spoke to the reason-
ing and goals of the initiative.

Desprez noted that the poli-

cy is present in some form at a 
majority of schools in the Big 
10 conference. The University’s 
iteration of the practice will 
notify parents if a first-year 
student under the age of 21

Friends remember 
Josh Brigham, who 
fell from Nickel’s 
Arcade rooftop

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

With 
candles 
in 
hand, 

fraternity brothers and friends 
of Josh Brigham — the LSA 
student who died in July after 
falling from the roof of Nickel’s 
Arcade — came together to 
celebrate his life with a vigil at 
the Chi Phi fraternity house.

Brigham, who was a rising 

senior 
studying 
psychology, 

died July 24. He fell through 
the arcade’s glass ceiling while 
climbing to the building’s roof 
through an unlocked stairway 
door. According to the Ann 
Arbor Police report, obtained by 
The Ann Arbor News, Brigham 
was intoxicated at the time of 
the incident.

Since many of the Saugatuck, 

Mich., native’s friends were 
unable to attend his funeral, 
LSA senior Alex Buchholtz, a 
friend and fraternity brother, 
said the vigil was held for 
friends to commemorate his life.

Tealight candles were given 

to the hundreds of people who 
filled the Chi Phi porch and 
lawn. On the porch, a photo 
of Brigham was placed with 
a candle, a pamphlet from his 
funeral, flowers and a can of 
Natural Ice beer.

Several people shared stories 

of the fun, happy friend who 
lived life in the moment.

“Josh was a very smiley 

guy,” Buchholtz said. “He made 
everyone laugh; he could make 
anyone laugh instantly … He 
was a very fun guy. He kind of 
lived it up and had fun when he 
could.”

Buchholtz, who organized 

the vigil, said since Brigham’s 

passing 
he’s 
found 
himself 

instinctively trying to call or 
text him.

“It’s just weird because last 

week I moved back to Ann 
Arbor, and when I was pulling 
into Ann Arbor I almost picked 
up the phone and called him,” 
Buchholtz said. “The other day 
I woke up after a long night and 
texted him to see if he could get 
some food.”

Seeing Nickel’s Arcade is 

hard for Buchholtz. He said 
the other night he visited it 
and cried for a half hour. The 
passing of their beloved friend 
was hard on everyone, but the

Republican 

candidate joins 

local, state officials 

outside Lansing 

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

BATH, Mich. — Ohio Gov. 

John Kasich wrapped up a two-
stop 
presidential 
campaign 

swing through Michigan on 
Tuesday at an event sponsored by 
the Lansing Regional Chamber 
of Commerce.

Kasich, who is seeking the 

Republican 
nomination 
for 

president, 
discussed 
small 

government and state autonomy 
before an audience of small-
business 
owners, 
business 

leaders and local officials.

The event marked Kasich’s 

fourth visit to the state since he 
announced his candidacy in July 
— the most of any presidential 
candidate this election season.

Kasich is currently polling 

8th in the Republican field, 
averaging 5 percent, according 
to a combination of polls from 
RealClear Politics.

Joe Ford, chair-elect of the 

Lansing 
Regional 
Chamber 

Board of Directors, introduced 
Kasich and joked that despite 

football rivalries, Michigan and 
Ohio are still neighbors with 
shared experiences.

Ford said Michiganders can 

appreciate Kasich’s achievements 
in Ohio, as Gov. Rick Snyder has 
led parallel reforms in the state.

“One 
of 
his 
major 

accomplishments 
was 
taking 

an $8 billion budget deficit 
and turning it into a $2 billion 
budget surplus, and in that 
process cutting $5 billion in 
corporate 
taxes,” 
Ford 
said. 

“That’s something in Michigan 
we can appreciate, because it’s 
the same kind of turnaround 
we’ve experienced and we’ve 
participated in and that our 
governor has led us through as 
well.”

Kasich 
echoed 
Ford’s 

sentiment, beginning his speech 
by expressing his respect for 
Snyder and his successes in 
Michigan, and saying Snyder is 
an example of a creative state 
leader.

Kasich 
said 
he 
felt 
a 

responsibility to help Ohio when 
he ran for governor, and related 
his experience with that of 
Snyder’s.

“I went in (in Ohio), and we 

were really just like Governor 
Snyder, we really were in a deep 
hole, 20 percent of our operating 
budget, and so I took on the same 
approach (as Snyder),” he said.

During his speech, Kasich also 

stressed Michigan’s importance 
to his campaign ahead of the 
primary elections.

“This is my fourth trip here. 

I’m going to be here quite a bit, 
because I consider Michigan to 
be very important in this primary 
process,” Kasich said.

Several 
state 
politicians, 

including Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, 
state Sen. Rick Jones (R–Grand 
Ledge), state Rep. Tom Leonard 
(R–DeWitt) and U.S. Rep. Mike 
Bishop 
(R–Mich.) 
attended 

Tuesday’s event. Ronna Romney 
McDaniel, chair of the Michigan 
Republican Party, also attended.

Kasich highlighted his plan to 

give states more autonomy and 
power to implement their own 
initiatives, citing examples of his 
own experiences as a governor 
coping with federal funding and 
regulations on issues such as 
welfare and job training.

“Let me train my workers, let 

me reform welfare, let me send 
a lot of these resources back 
to the states so we can run our 
education programs,” he said. 
“There are so many of these 
areas where we need to restore 
power where we live.”

He said as president, he would 

visit all 50 state capitals to share 
best policy practices from across 
the country.

— is that we believe strongly that 
for University of Michigan stu-
dents, we’re a resource wherever 
they are, especially in the density 
of the areas surrounding the cam-
pus,” said DPSS Executive Director 
Eddie Washington in an exclu-
sive interview with The Michigan 
Daily on Wednesday.

Though DPSS officers could 

eventually have concurrent juris-
diction to enforce state laws in off-
campus locations, such as a noise 
complaint at a fraternity, Wash-
ington said the division’s current 
efforts, beginning this Welcome 
Week, will focus more intensely on 
outreach.

“The Division of Public Safety 

and Security is now mobilizing in a 
way where we want to be more pre-
ventive, and the enforcement piece 
is more on the tail-end,” he said.

The Ann Arbor Police has gener-

ally had sole jurisdiction to enforce 
city ordinances and state laws off-
campus, whereas units of DPSS 
— which includes the University 
of Michigan Police Department, 
as well as housing, hospital and 
museum security — police prop-
erty owned by the University. The 
two departments have concurrent 
jurisdiction over roads that abut 
Ann Arbor and University prop-
erty.

With the proposed arrange-

ment, UMPD officers would be 
granted the ability to issue tick-
ets or otherwise enforce laws of 
the State of Michigan, though city 
ordinances would remain solely 
under the jurisdiction of the AAPD.

Similar 
collaborations 
have 

already been in place at schools 
like Eastern Michigan University, 
which has long partnered with 
Ypsilanti authorities.

Washington said the aim is to 

allow University officers to interact 

with students wherever they are — 
which historically has not been the 
case.

“It’s more to be proactive,” he 

said. “So if you’re at the party, the 
idea is that we’ve already talked to 
you ahead of time.”

Washington said DPSS would 

like to host forums and be invited 
to the kinds of educational meet-
ings typically handled by AAPD, 
including those hosted by Greek 
Life chapters, for example. The 
University, he said, aims to devote 
more resources to providing the 
kinds of proactive programs and 
informational 
materials 
AAPD 

didn’t typically have the resources 
to cover extensively.

“What we’re saying is we’re 

going to be in the room now, too,” 
he said.

He also hopes students will 

wield DPSS as a resource as well, 
citing an instance in which a fra-
ternity reached out to DPSS for 

panied by other serious behavior 
such as needing medical atten-
tion, significant property damage 
or driving under the influence,” or 
if one of these students “has a sec-
ond alcohol or drug infraction.”

Whether or not parents are 

contacted after the policy’s speci-
fied infractions, however, will be 
evaluated on a case-to-case basis.

“Part of what we have talked 

about is trying to leave some 
space,” Harper said. “Should, in 
the course of having a conver-
sation with a student, there is a 
sense that actually calling would 
not be in their best interest, then 
we won’t.”

Desprez elaborated that dan-

gerous behavior in relation to 
alcohol and/or drugs can be a 
result of family issues, disfunc-
tion or even genetic disposition 
— and the University will try to be 
sensitive to these issues, among 
others, in evaluating the need to 
contact parents.

Harper said the new direc-

tive of calling parents is atypical 

for the University, but Desprez 
explained that the culture of 
excess alcohol consumption has 
necessitated a response.

Four years of data harvested 

from Alcohol Edu, Desprez said, 
revealed that 35 percent of first-
year students drink in a high-risk 
way. Subsequently, first-years were 
determined to be the appropriate 
target group for the pilot program.

She said the new policy is not a 

matter of policing and punishing 
students — but will instead focus 
on making students recognize 
and prevent “harmful” behavior. 
This is where parents come into 
the picture: in an increasingly 
digital age, Desprez noted, stu-
dents text their parents or other 
family members an average of 13 
times each day.

“Part of this also is, students 

tell us, when we ask them, ‘Who 
is the biggest influence on your 
decisions and your values,’ they 
always say parents or family,” 
Desprez said. “So part of this is us 
partnering with the people they 
have told us are the biggest part of 
their support network.”

Sentimentality appears to be 

one of the larger motivating fac-

tors behind the decision to contact 
parents after inherently dangerous 
or repeat violations of the Univer-
sity’s drug and alcohol policies. 
The policy, Desprez said, is about 
“having a conversation” within the 
framework of “constructive, non-
judgmental early intervention.”

This process will also involve 

informing at-risk students of 
the University’s resources with 
regard to future behavior — from 
methods for safer consumption 
like Stay in the Blue, to units 
focusing on addiction recovery.

Ultimately 
Harper 
and 

Desprez acknowledged that there 
is not hard evidence to support 
the success of involving parents 
in the process of monitoring and 
preventing alcohol-related harm.

“There are a lot of people who 

would tell you that parent-family 
communication is a ‘best prac-
tice,’ not an ‘evidence base,’ which 
is why we are piloting the pro-
gram,” Desprez said. “So when 
you ask what is our motivation 
for such a rigorous evaluation, I 
think we understand that it’s con-
sidered to be a best practice across 
the country, but we also want to 
see the data.”

Fight breaks out 
in Liberty Plaza

The Ann Arbor News reported 

that a fight including 25 individu-
als broke out yesterday afternoon 
at about 12:40 p.m. 

The Ann Arbor Police Depart-

ment is continuing to investigate 
the incident. One person was 
injured and taken to the hospital. 

Inaugural ‘Gayz 
Crayz’ hits Palmer

Pride Outside — formally “Gayz 

Craze” 
— was held at the Central 

Campus Recreational Building 
and sponsored by Central Student 
Government’s LGBT Issues Com-
mission. 

vigil focused on the positive 
contributions Brigham brought 
into their lives.

LSA senior Danny Bakst 

lived 
with 
Brigham 
last 

year and said he remembers 
spending 10 hours in the 
library studying with him for 
their political science exam, 
as well as time spent together 
playing intramural soccer and 
basketball.

“The 
things 
I’m 
really 

missing the most are the little 
moments of him,” Bakst said. 
“It’s not the big parties, it’s not 
the ski trips or the vacations, 
it’s just sitting on the couch 
with Josh.”

Kinesiology 
senior 
Dan 

Costa also lived with Brigham. 
Costa called Brigham his best 
friend; they met while rushing 
Chi Phi together, and Costa 
almost didn’t get a bid from the 
frat because he had spent all of 
rush talking to Brigham.

He recounted his birthday 

freshman year, which fell on 
Thanksgiving. Brigham was 
one of the only people who 
wanted to go out that night.

“We got a few drinks going 

and it was just me and him all 
night. We just walked around 

Ann Arbor, and it was honestly 
one of the most fun nights I’ve 
ever had around here,” Costa 
said. “He always brings a smile 
to my face.”

Josh Rubley, a childhood 

friend, said he spent all of 
his summer with Brigham. 
He said it was one of the best 
summers of his life; they hung 
out constantly and even got 
tattoos together. After Brigham 
passed, Rubley didn’t ever want 
to return to Ann Arbor because 
it brought up memories of 
Josh, but the outpouring of 
support Rubley received from 
Brigham’s college friends made 
him feel comforted.

“You guys have shown the 

most hospitality; I honestly 
never wanted to come back 
here,” Rubley said. “Thank you 
guys for all of the kindness and 
support. It’s awesome to know 
he has a great family of friends 
here to take care of him as well.”

Nursing junior Ann Marie 

Sweeney said she left the vigil 
feeling comforted.

“They 
encompassed 

everything he was: happy, the 
best person, thought everything 
was positive, had the best 
outlook on life,” Sweeney said, 
tearing up. “I’m glad they kept it 
positive — live like Josh would. 
It’s the best thing we can do. It’s 
what he would want.”

T

his summer, I did one of the 
most childish things I could 
think of: I got my tonsils out.

Which was a 

mistake. A mas-
sive 
mistake. 

A 
humongous 

“why-did-I-do-
this-there-are-
so-many-other-ways-I-could-have-
spent-these-two-weeks-other-than-
as-a-miserable-vegetable” mistake.

And also not a mistake, but not 

for the obvious medical reason.

Technically, I needed it done, so 

even if I hadn’t wanted it, it would 
have happened anyway. But what I 
didn’t really know at the time was 
that not only would I be in terrible 
pain, but I would also be stripped 
of all independence during recov-
ery, which was a good thing and a 
 

bad thing.

Mainly a bad one (but silver 

linings exist).

For some background, getting 

your tonsils out as an adult is not the 
same as what a child goes through 
with the same procedure. Your ton-
sils are supposed to be pretty prom-
inent as a kid since they help with 
blocking germs and fighting infec-
tions, which children (i.e. dirt mon-
sters) are prone to. By maturation, 
however, the tonsils are supposed 
to be smaller in proportion to your 
adult throat and farther back and 
out of the way. Getting them out is 
more of a hassle, because they’ve 
basically taken a stronger root.

However, my tonsils touched in 

the middle and appeared to be gain-
ing some sort of sentience. They 
would growl in the night, and they 
seemed to be developing some very 
concerning opinions, such as “The 
Big Bang Theory” being a good 
show, so they had to go.

So out they came. And with that 

came two weeks of feeling like I 
was swallowing crushed glass, an 
inability to speak and eat most any-
thing, weakness from malnourish-

ment and a prescription for some 
hard drugs to help manage all this. 
This also took away my ability to 
handle large machinery (like the 
cool forklift I drive to work).

Naturally, this bedridden state I 

was in brought to mind all the par-
allels that my life now held to what 
life was like as a small child, com-
pletely beholden to my parents.

Which most of me hated. Not all 

of me, of course, since part of it is a 
sweet deal of being catered to, but 
it also meant I couldn’t go to the 
midnight monster truck rallies I 
host weekly.

It wasn’t just me seeing these 

child/adult-without-tonsils parallels, 
though: When I checked into the hos-
pital for the surgery, the receptionist 
gave me a side-eye and asked if I was 
looking for C.S. Mott Childeren’s 
Hospital. My post-operation instruc-
tions listed numbers of pediatricians 
to direct questions to. Google even 
kept trying to redirect me to chil-
dren’s health websites while I was 
doing research. (No, I did not mean, 
“Help me I’m an infant in an adult’s 
body,” Google. Rude.)

This weird mix of childhood and 

adulthood is an interesting mirror 
to my college experience, though. 
These four years are a strange 
time of outgrowing (but really not 
outgrowing) childhood ties and 
navigating new adult terrain and 
responsibilities, such as paying bills 
and learning the family trade of 
mummy hunting.

I think that many college stu-

dents feel somewhat alone once they 
leave home. For instance, person-
ally, calling Mom and Dad for help 
was definitely the easiest option 
to figure out most problems, but it 
began to feel like failure to me by 
my fourth semester; I kept feeling 
like the things I was calling about 
(“How do I get mocha out of my lap-
top’s CD drive?”) should and could 
be handled on my own. I’m sure for 
others, this idea is relatable, at least 

when it comes to graduation; avoid-
ing moving home after graduation 
is definitely a major source of fuel, 
at least subconsciously, in all post-
grad job hunts.

Should this be the case, though?
While I knew that my parents 

always enjoyed having me home for 
summers (I’m a delight) and looked 
forward to my constant calls and 
texts (can’t get rid of me that eas-
ily), letting go and handing over the 
reins during these two weeks was 
perhaps beneficial for both of us. 
It reminded me that for one, par-
ents miss you when you leave and 
they want to take care of you, and 
secondly, college is stressful, and 
relying on others is not weakness or 
immaturity. 

I feel closer to my mom than 

ever right now because we had to 
be so in sync to deal with my gross 
throat, and I know my dad is always 
ready to run out the door on a 
grocery run the minute I complain 
that a popsicle looked at me funny 
or isn’t the right color. They never 
once complained. We were a team, 
and I think that’s exactly how a 
lot of parents see their children’s 
college 
educations. 
Navigating 

the bureaucracy of administration 
and getting to graduation intact is 
often a two- or three-person job. 
Reaching out to parents, family and 
even your friends is only going to 
help. They’re there to support you.

So, while my time lazing around 

and not worrying about anything 
but my painkiller schedule like 
a successful drug lord wasn’t 
completely enjoyable, it was a good 
time to reconnect with the idea of 
depending on others and asking 
for help. Plus, now I know that 
family will take care of you once 
an obscene amount of blood comes 
from your mouth, so that’s also 
good to know.

Y

our first arrival to campus 
— an unofficial inaugura-
tion to your undergradu-

ate career — is 
usually steeped 
in expectation. 
Driving through 
unfamiliar 
streets, you excit-
edly survey the 
city that’ll serve 
as the stage for 
the next few 
years of your life. 
With a full back-
pack, welcome 
info packets at your feet and boxes 
(or alternatively, some unlucky 
sibling unwillingly enlisted as a 
member of your moving crew) sit-
ting in the car seat next to you, 
you anxiously stare out of the 
window. Every film depiction of 
college you’ve seen up until this 
point has filled your imagination 
with scenes of expertly landscaped 
quadrangles, verdant lawns, stately 
buildings and drab dormitories. It’s 
everything you expected it would 
be. As you venture toward the sec-
tion of off-campus student houses, 
you curiously search for any and 
all signs of the rumored crazy col-
lege shenanigans. However, among 
all of your preconceived images of 
the stereotypical rowdiness and 
ruckus, the last thing you may 
expect to see is a spray-painted, 
sexist phrase hanging from one of 
the balconies.

At Old Dominion University in 

Virginia, some of these college 
shenanigans grew too derogatory 
and recently ignited a controversy. 
Students — new and old alike — 
passing by the school’s chapter 
of Sigma Nu fraternities were 
welcomed by makeshift bedsheet 
banners with crudely scrawled 
lettering 
that 
designated 
the 

building as a “freshman daughter 
drop-off” site. Accompanying the 
message was a separate banner 
declaring, “Rowdy and Fun, Hope 
Your Baby Girl Is Ready for a Good 
Time.” Old Dominion University’s 
chapter of Sigma Nu even extended 
the invitation to the girls’ parents 
with a third and final banner that 
read, “Go Ahead and Drop Off 
 

Mom Too.”

These banners incited national 

media attention and immediate 

action from the Old Dominion 
administrators. The disrespectful 
messages prompted the suspension 
of the school’s chapter of Sigma 
Nu. Old Dominion University’s 
president responded quickly with 
a statement, and an investigation of 
the incident is pending.

Assigning disciplinary action for 

displaying derogatory messages, 
such as the ones seen at ODU, 
has initiated a troubling debate. 
The students and the words on 
these crudely designed signs are 
protected by the First Amendment. 
Some argue that the actions and 
media coverage so far have taken 
the situation out of proportion, 
while others claim these messages 
contribute to rape culture in 
environments with high prevalence 
of sexual assault.

These incidents, for the most part, 

were probably intended as highly 
inappropriate and poorly thought 
out jokes. Yet the overall messages, 
while they may not directly threaten 
or proposition a specific woman, are 
not something to toss aside lightly, 
especially when these are in no way 
isolated incidents. 

Signs toting sexist messages 

similar to the ones portrayed at 
ODU have emerged outside of 
various fraternities and student 
houses for years. A house at Ohio 
State University hung a banner 
marketing “Daughter Day Care 2.0” 
and another claiming “Dads, We’ll 
Take It From Here.” Variations of 
sexist phrases have appeared at 
numerous universities in the past, 
illustrating a disturbing trend.

The 
Atlantic 
wrote, 
“these 

immature 19-year-olds displayed 
bad judgement, but so do the adults 
who are reacting as if they were 
stockpiling GHB. Pop culture is 
filled with material far more vulgar 
and offensive, including content 
that 
does 
actually 
transgress 

against 
the 
value 
placed 
on 

consent.”

One can label these messages as 

a dumb and disrespectful tradition, 
but we can’t deny the fact that these 
messages, unintentionally offensive 
and degrading or not, contribute to 
a flawed culture that continually 
degrades and objectifies women on 
various platforms. If our society 
truly is filled with “material far 
more vulgar and offensive” already, 

then our goal should be to remedy 
this instead of dismissing slightly 
less demeaning material because it 
doesn’t cross a pre-existing line.

There’s an understanding that, 

to a certain degree, the humor of 
college students is expected to 
be immature, crass and crude. 
However, the annual appearance of 
mattresses, sheets and signs sporting 
these 
sexist, 
derogatory 
spray-

paint messages provides a subtle 
reminder to the undergraduate 
female populations that even while 
attending institutions of academic 
rigor, you’re not going to escape the 
possibility of being objectified and 
sexualized.

The vast majority of young 

women — if they haven’t already 
encountered it — become exposed 
to a world of crude comments, 
unsolicited propositions and often 
unshakeable concerns about the 
safety of the spaces they inhabit 
once they reach adulthood. Seeing 
signs 
thanking 
their 
parents 

for bringing them as if college-
aged women were products to be 
deposited and used only further 
proves 
the 
existence 
of 
this 

uncomfortable sphere.

As a woman far too accustomed 

to 
regularly 
being 
exposed 
to 

similar messages in the media 
or as I walk around Ann Arbor, I 
can acknowledge some realities. 
Removing some failed attempts at 
being funny will not instantly make 
me or other women feel safer. It 
won’t immediately circumvent the 
reception of derogatory solicitations 
or offensive, unnerving comments, 
nor can anyone realistically expect 
that to be the outcome. These 
banners and signs deserve media 
attention and heavy criticism not 
because 
they’re 
saying 
things 

students and worrying parents don’t 
want to hear; they deserve it because 
seemingly insignificant scenarios 
and attitudes contribute to societal 
problems as much as the larger ones. 
We, as members of active campus 
communities, 
should 
denounce 

sexist cultures and work to end high 
rates of sexual assault. But to do so we 
need to be aware of and challenge the 
problematic attitudes that continue 
to pervade society.

focus 
on 
wellness 
and 

caring, not enforcement and 
punishment — a key point 
not mentioned in the e-mail 
or Record article. This focus 
appears to lend itself toward 
a necessary changing of the 
culture surrounding alcohol 
on campus, but much needs 
to clarified.

Clarification should begin 

with the decision to notify 
parents in the event of 
certain alcohol violations. 
Mary Jo Desprez, director 
of Wolverine Wellness, said 
in the interview parents will 
be provided ways to have a 
conversation with their child 
that focuses on “constructive, 
non-judgmental 
early 

intervention.” 
The 
policy 

change appears to perpetuate 
the idea that our generation 
is 
immature. 
However, 

Desprez 
emphasized 
that 

the typical student values 
frequent 
communication 

with their parents, so the 
University is simply tapping 
into 
students’ 
support 

networks 
when 
trouble 

appears to be on the horizon. 
As it turns out, whether or 
not the University contacts 
a student’s parents is flexible 
and will be determined on a 
case-by-case basis, which is 
not said in Harper’s e-mail 
or the Record article. If 

contacting 
the 
student’s 

parents or other caregiver 
is likely to cause more 
harm than good for the 
student, as determined by 
Wolverine Wellness, then 
they will not be contacted. 
Why the University chose 
to not include this nuance is 
confusing given how crucial 
that point is.

Similarly, details are hard 

to find in UMPD’s initiative 
to 
increasing 
community 

policing efforts in regard to 
alcohol use in off-campus 
neighborhoods. 
Beginning 

immediately, UMPD will be 
partnering even more with the 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
to expand outreach.

“The Division of Public 

Safety and Security is now 
mobilizing in a way where we 
want to be more preventive, 
and the enforcement piece is 
more on the tail-end,” said 
DPSS 
Executive 
Director 

Eddie Washington in a Daily 
interview. “It’s more to be 
proactive, so if you’re at the 
party, the idea is that we’ve 
already talked to you ahead 
of time.”

These are noble intentions, 

but how this outreach will 
be executed is still fuzzy. 
Harper explained to the 
Daily that this engagement 
includes 
police 
officers 

educating the community 
about preventing “harmful” 
behavior. This week, UMPD 
officers knocked on students’ 

doors hoping to create a 
dialogue between officers 
and students about safe party 
and alcohol use procedures. 
However, questions as to 
whether organizations, such 
as Greek life institutions 
or 
co-ops, 
must 
engage 

with police first and the 
exact methods to be used 
for outreach still need to be 
answered. Also, according 
to 
Washington, 
another 

jurisdiction 
agreement 
is 

being 
assembled 
that, 
if 

signed, would allow both 
UMPD and AAPD to have 
the ability to educate and 
also ticket violators.

With 
45 
percent 
of 

students admitting to binge 
drinking in a 2014 National 
College 
Health 
Assement 

survey conducted by the 
University Health System, 
it’s clear that our campus has 
problems with alcohol. But 
right now, there are far too 
many ambiguities to know 
how this initiative will play 
out — and that’s the problem. 
The University needs to 
take steps to better describe 
the complete program to 
the general student body as 
to not leave students more 
confused than they would be 
on a drunken night at Skeeps. 
But if the University can get 
its act together quickly on 
this matter and figure out 
the nuances, there is the 
potential for positive change.

While 
Schlissel 
hosted 
a 

similar event last year, this 
year’s layout was adjusted to 
accommodate long lines.

Last 
year, 
Schlissel 
and 

Schwebs received attendees on 
their patio, meaning the long

This year, Schlissel decided to 
receive students further into

for those invited to explore the 
home and socialize.

LSA junior Jasen Garborg said 

he found the event to be a chance 
to meet new people.

“I thought the event would be 

a good opportunity to meet some 
other students,” Garborg said. “I 
am a transfer student, so maybe 
I could meet some other transfer

Garborg also waited in the 

long line to shake hands and chat 

with Schlissel for a few minutes.

“It

LSA junior Erich Eberhard 

came to the event for a very

“I came here for one purpose, 

and one purpose only: to find 
out if Schlissel actually lives in 
this house,” Eberhard said. “I’ve 
been wondering since I was a 
freshman whether or not the 
presidents live in this house.”

According

Eberhard, 

Schlissel responded that he was 
quick to accept the offer to live

President walks 
to New Student 
Convocation with 
freshmen students

By BRANDON 

SUMMERS-MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

Students and staff gathered 

on the front lawn of Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel’s 
South University Avenue home 
to participate in the first annu-
al walk to the Crisler Center for 
New Student Convocation.

The Friday afternoon walk, 

which began with about 50 stu-
dents at the President’s House, 
quickly grew into a large crowd 
of University freshmen, resi-
dence hall staff and the occa-
sional faculty member.

The procession was orga-

nized to give freshmen a unique 
experience to meet Schlis-
sel and other members of the 
freshman class.

LSA 
junior 
Elizabeth 

Warbasse, a South Quad resi-
dent advisor, said convocation 
provides a good introduction to 
the University, and she wanted 
to be sure her residents didn’t 
miss the opportunity to attend.

“I really wanted my fresh-

men in my hall to have the 
chance to meet the president of 
the University,” she added.

The trail to convocation 

passed 
several 
University 

icons including an impromptu 
performance by the Michi-
gan Marching Band and a visit 
from the South Quad mascot, 
Squady.

As the procession reached 

its destination, freshmen took 
their seats in the Crisler Center 
to hear Schlissel welcome them 
to the University.

At the beginning of his 

address, 
Schlissel 
jokingly 

advised 
freshmen 
students 

to try the corned beef reuben 
from Zingerman’s Delicatessen 
and invest in a warm winter 
coat.

Schlissel said this fall’s fresh-

man class was admitted dur-
ing yet another year of record 
applications — over 50,000 in 
all — with Schlissel stressing 
that attending the University is 
already a great distinction few 
others can claim.

“I’ve learned a tremendous 

amount about the kind of stu-
dent we attract here to the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and what 
their experience will be like 
here,” he said. “I learned first-
hand that our students — that 

you — have tremendous energy, 
entrepreneurial spirit, social 
consciousness 
and 
amazing 

potential.”

Schlissel welcomed parents 

in the audience as well.

“You are now all members 

of the Michigan family,” he 
said. “I hope you parents are 
as proud of your students as we 
are.”

During the remainder of his 

speech, Schlissel emphasized 
the impact University students 
and alumni across the country 
and abroad.

“You’ve come to Michigan 

to make a difference in the 
world,” he said.

Convocation also featured 

several talent acts, including 
an appearance by the Michigan 
Men’s Glee Club, a performance 
by Michigan Manzil and a ren-
dition of the national anthem 
by Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior Nora Schell.

LSA 
freshman 
Madeline 

Carter, who attended Friday’s 
ceremony, said she is looking 
forward to her time at the Uni-
versity.

“There’s so much spirit at 

Michigan, and it makes me so 
excited to be a part of every-
thing,” she said. “It’s so much 
more than I could have thought 
it would be.”

New academic year marks 
new tradition for Schlissel

Professor emeritus, 
University Musical 
Society receive award

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University 
Musical 

Society and George Shirley, a 
professor emeritus at the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance, will 
receive the prestigious National 
Medal of Arts at a White House 
ceremony Thursday.

The medal — the highest 

recognition 
for 
support 
or 

excellence in the arts — is the 
latest in a lengthy list of accolades 
for Shirley, which includes a 
Grammy Award for his rendition 
of Ferrando in Mozart’s “Così fan 
tutte.”

Presented annually by the 

president since 1984, medal 
winners are selected from a 
pool of nominees determined 
by the National Endowment 
for the Arts and reviewed by 
the National Council on the 
Arts.

Despite 
his 
history 
of 

recognition, Shirley said he never 
expected to receive such an 
honor.

“I wasn’t looking for, I wasn’t 

doing it to be rewarded. I was 
doing it because God granted me 
the gifts — I think when you’re 
presented 
with 
opportunities 

to do things then you do the 
best you can. The rewards come 
when the audience loves the 
performance, and you know that 
you’ve touched them.”

Shirley is considered pioneer 

for Black artists. At 27 years old, 
he was the first Black male to play 
a leading role in the Metropolitan 
Opera.

Raised in Detroit, Shirley 

began studying music education 
at Wayne State University before 
he was appointed the first Black 
high-school music teacher in 
Detroit Public Schools.

Before 
teaching 
at 
the 

University, Shirley first taught at 
the University of Maryland.

“In teaching, rewards are 

manifested in the success of your 
students,” Shirley said. “Those 
are the rewards I’ve looked for 
in life and in the profession. 
Accolades will come from higher 
up in a sense, many for me are 
surprises.”

Shirley 
referenced 
David 

Daniels, a former University

current 
faculty 

member in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance, saying under 
his instruction, Daniels became 

one of the leading countertenors 
in the world.

In 1987, Shirley began his

“The variety, and the focus 

has always been on finding 
the best performers,” he said. 
“Whether it be opera, theatera, 
dance,

‘Hannibal’ stuns

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

Writing a series finale might be 

the hardest job in the world. Those 
unlucky 
writ-

ers must follow 
a stringent set of 
guidelines if their 
ending is to join 
the likes of “Six 
Feet Under” in 
the Great Finale 
Hall 
of 
Fame 

and avoid being 
tossed into the Garbage Can of Gar-
bage Finales with “How I Met Your 
Mother” and “Dexter.” First, series 
finales have to wrap up lingering 
plot threads from previous episodes; 
series finales are also season finales, 
after all. However, the writer can’t 
be satisfied with just crafting a pat 
chapter ending. Viewers expect 
that the show end up going some-
where, which means that the writer 
had better start tying things up in 
a beautiful bow or blowing shit up. 
But most importantly, the writer has 
to craft ten perfect minutes to end 
the show. Those last few scenes are 
what people remember about the 
finale; everything else is incidental.

The series finale of “Hanni-

bal” was, admittedly, not perfect. 
Because of the season’s split struc-
ture, mid-season time jump and 
the introduction of new characters, 
“Hannibal” relied more heavily 
on exposition and table-setting to 
advance the story to its endpoint. 
With better plotting (or a higher 
episode count), Francis Dolarhyde’s 
(Richard Armitage, “Strike Back”) 
fake-out death could have occurred 
in a different episode, so Will (Hugh 
Dancy, “Martha Marcy May Mar-
lene”) and Jack’s (Laurence Fish-
burne, “The Matrix”) scheming 
could have been more developed. 
The final appearances of beloved 
supporting characters could be 
more organically mixed into the 
drama, and Alana Bloom (Caroline 
Dhavernas, “Wonderfalls”) could 
have a better reason to visit Hanni-

bal than, well, convenience. But I’ll 
cut the finale a bit of slack — series 
creator Bryan Fuller imagined seven 
seasons to tell his story, and “The 
Wrath of the Lamb” is only the final 
installment because of a cruel strike 
from the TV Gods. Some things 
don’t end the way they should.

Francis Dolarhyde (alias “The 

Red Dragon”) served as an effec-
tive villain for the second half of 
the season, but his stories were 
regretfully isolated. As the clock 
counted down to “Hannibal” ’s final 
episode, I was acutely aware of how 
little Dolarhyde interacted with the 
show’s main characters apart from 
close calls and near-threats. The 
character existed in his own world, 
drawn to art, films and literature 
because of the distance and they 
afforded him. From the beginning, 
Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen, 
“The Hunt”) made such an effec-
tive villain because of his proximity 
to investigator Will. The infamous 
Chesapeake Ripper was right there 
the whole time. Dolarhyde’s silence, 
while a cool change of pace from 
Hannibal’s omnipresence, was not 
the best choice for a final battle.

But when it comes down to it, The 

Red Dragon didn’t really matter. He 
was a catalyst, the bait that would 
draw Hannibal and Will together 
again. Dolarhyde’s crimes ripped 
Will from his “maddeningly polite” 
life with his wife, stepson and dozen 
adopted dogs. The mirrors that Dol-
arhyde placed on his victim’s naked 
bodies forced Will to confront the 
fact that he’d never be able to escape 
this life. His empathy would always 
extend to The Ripper and The Drag-
on and sick fuckers of the world, and 
he was cursed to see himself in the 
atrocities they created.

From the beginning of the sea-

son, “Hannibal” has made it clear 
that Will would never be able to 
escape Hannibal’s influence. Will 
could bide his time, but Hannibal 
would always be waiting, knife in 
hand, ready to enjoy his long-await-
ed meal of the only man who ever 
challenged him. The finale received 

a jolt of energy as soon as Hannibal 
brought Will to the cliffside house 
where he brought Miriam Lass and 
Abigail Hobbs so long ago. Hannibal 
lamented the erosion of the cliff and 
the passage of time; the cliff would 
continue edging back and engulf-
ing land, and someday it’d overtake 
them all. With one gorgeous meta-
phor, “Hannibal” predicted the 
ending that would come just a few 
minutes later.

After Dolarhyde was vanquished 

and lay a bloody husk on the 
ground, a wounded Will reached 
to embrace Hannibal. He clutched 
him like a savior, as Hannibal reas-
suringly said that “this is all (he) 
ever wanted … for both of us.” So 
Will gave in, and the two of them 
fell gracefully off the cliff. The 
two were shot like a Renaissance 
painting, all Caravaggian lights 
and shadows and Biblical-pained 
expressions. “Hannibal” is con-
sistently praised for its gorgeous 
cinematography, but director of 
photography James Hawkinson 
(“Community”) deserves one final 
shout-out for framing such iconic 
final images. Just like Hannibal 
remarked, his and Will’s ending 
was truly beautiful.

When considered as a whole, 

“The Wrath of the Lamb” may not 
be “Hannibal” ’s finest episode. 
The season had to work overtime to 
finish up the arcs of two major vil-
lains — since he was only featured 
in a few episodes, The Red Dragon 
wasn’t as formidable as he could 
have been. But I truly think that 
ten years from now (or whenever 
that inevitable “Hannibal” reboot 
ends up happening), nobody will 
remember season three as the 
season when Reba tried to grab 
a key from Dolarhyde’s neck and 
Alana wore pantsuits. The job of a 
finale is to provide a poetic end to a 
show, a dreamy final note to close a 
years-long symphony. Ultimately, 
the last chapter of “Hannibal” was 
all about that jump off the cliff. It 
wasn’t perfect, but it was all I ever 
wanted.

‘Girl’ breaks norms

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Don’t be fooled by the con-

ventionally beautiful, glamorous 
woman on the cover. Constance 
Kopp was an intimidating person, 
made 
much 

more so by the 
fact 
that 
she 

never let general 
rules of woman-
ly etiquette stop 
her from slam-
ming rude men 
against walls.

“Girl 
Waits 

with Gun” by 
Amy 
Stewart, 

the best-selling author of “The 
Drunken Botanist,” is based on the 
true story of one of America’s first 
female sheriffs in 1914. In delving 
into the lives of Constance and her 
younger sisters, Norma and Fleu-
rette, Amy Stewart tells a tale as 
captivating as it is genuinely funny 
in its portrayal of three bewildered 
sisters who find themselves in a 
war with one of the most powerful 
men in their hometown.

The story begins when an auto-

mobile collides with the carriage 
that the three sisters are riding 
in. As the dust settles around 
the crash and a crowd gathers to 
watch the spectacle, Constance 
insists to Henry Kaufman — the 
cocky driver and a rich silk fac-
tory owner — and his grinning 
posse that they pay for the dam-
ages. Kaufman and his henchmen 
laugh it off and drive away, but 
Constance refuses to let it go. Thus 
begins the battle for justice.

The sisters, who are accus-

tomed to a quiet life on a farm 
away from gossipy townsfolk, 
are unprepared for Kaufman’s 
vile scare tactics, as he begins to 
terrorize them in an attempt to 
have them drop the charges. Con-
stance finds herself working with 
the town sheriff to help some of 
Kaufman’s other victims, solving 
a mysterious crime in the process. 
 

Set in the early 20th century 

the novel captures the strug-
gles that women — particularly 
unmarried women — had to face, 
especially concerning the ancient 
conundrum of not “having a man 
around the place.” Francis Kopp, 
their brother, is constantly try-
ing to force them into moving in 
with his family, unaware of the 
fact that every time he interferes 
he complicates life for everyone.

The personalities of the three 

sisters complement and coun-
teract each other so perfectly, it 
feels slightly self-indulgent — but 
their back-and-forth sibling ban-
ter is so recognizable and natural 
that it doesn’t matter. Stewart 
has an ear for dialogue, and Con-
stance’s role as the narrator is so 
unobtrusive that her pragmatic 
personality shines through the 
lines.

The most intriguing relation-

ship is between Constance and 
the sheriff, who can never be sure 
how Constance will surprise 
him next — especially after she 
turns out to be a sharpshooter 
and unafraid to manhandle men. 
Stewart captures the hesitancy 
shown on both sides as the origi-
nal protector/protected relation-
ship between the two evolves 
into a partnership.

I could almost feel Stewart’s 

knowing smile behind my shoul-
der as I kept turning the pages, 
expecting that in a story of three 
young women — one of whom is 
still in her teens and professed 
to be a great beauty — there’d be 
some romance, somewhere.

But there isn’t, and it’s great — 

not because of the lack of roman-
tic storylines, or in spite of it. 
There’s no romance, period. The 
book is awesome, period. Holly-
wood could learn a thing or two.

One of the funniest and most 

well-written scenes is toward the 
end, when Constance answers an 
advertisement in the paper for 
female detectives in a shop; she 
can’t think of any job for which 

she is more suited, and is con-
fident in her ability to win over 
her interviewer as she makes her 
way to the back of the store. The 
manager is polite to Constance, 
but asks her to please step aside 
as she is expecting a prospective 
employee. The manager looks 
around for a petite, girlish fig-
ure as Constance stands in front 
of her, nonplussed. When Con-
stance informs the woman that 
she is the one that came for the 
job, the woman laughs. She needs 
someone unobtrusive, she tells 
Constance; someone of whom 
potential thieves wouldn’t be 
suspicious.

Though Constance knows that 

she is tall, strong and the oldest of 
a quirky family that mainly keeps 
to themselves, she never fails to 
underestimate how intimidated 
others are by her. She makes the 
court howl with laughter at her 
impatient, staccato answers to 
reporters’ stupid questions, as she 
is baffled by the people question-
ing her intellect because of her 
gender. Constance is unfailingly 
funny when she doesn’t mean to 
be, and is constantly confused 
when people find her so.

Stewart’s understanding of 

the zeitgeist of the early 20th 
century and her ability to convey 
the humor even in grim situa-
tions is seen in how Constance 
poses a literally physical threat 
to Kaufman, and no one quite 
knows how to deal with it, mak-
ing for several funny encounters 
and several sulky men. At one 
point, Constance has Kaufman 
pinned to the wall, and one of 
the men watching shouts, “Take 
your hands off of her!” Every-
one laughs at how ridiculous 
it sounds. Except Kaufman, of 
course, who tries very hard to 
look nonchalant rather than 
scared shitless (and fails).

“Girl Waits with Gun” left me 

wanting a sequel badly — but, like 
its heroine, it stands quite sturdi-
ly on its own two feet.

LITERATURE COLUMN

To kill ‘Atticus 

Finch’

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Literature Columnist
“

I’ll say one thing for her 
– she sure can write.” My 
dad said to me, interrupting 

my reading of Harper Lee’s “Go 
Set A Watchman.” The recently 
released novel, a chronological 
sequel to Lee’s first book, was 
actually written prior to her 
iconic “To Kill A Mockingbird.

As it is for many Americans, 

the story of Scout during her 
transformative 10th summer 
in Alabama is more than just a 
book to me. One of my fondest 
childhood memories is of listen-
ing with my brother to my father 
reading “To Kill A Mockingbird” 
in the summer when I was nine 
years old. With my logical and 
kind father, my teasing older 
brother and my god awful haircut 
that resembled Mary Badham’s 
in the film adaption, I related to 
Scout on a fundamental level. As 
I grew older and had to study the 
novel twice in high school, I con-
tinued to naively adore its charac-
ters. I proudly donned the “What 
Would Atticus Do?” pin given to 
everyone in my grade. When my 
neighbor’s family named their 
dog Atticus, I gave my whole-
hearted approval. Like Scout in 
the novel, I put Atticus on a ped-
estal. But “Go Set A Watchman” 
crushes that pedestal, putting 
Atticus firmly on the ground as 
the human being he is.

“Go Set A Watchman” begins 

with the adult Scout, who now 
goes by her given name Jean-
Louise, when she returns to 
her hometown of Maycomb, 
Alabama from her life in New 
York City. At first she slips back 
into her old town comfortably, 
flirting with her high school 
sweetheart, Henry Clinton, 
and fighting with her Aunt 

Alexandra. Her ease ends when 
she finds out that Atticus, Jean-
Louise’s earliest model of integ-
rity and fairness, is a member of 
a version of the Klu Klux Klan 
called the Citizen’s Council.

The racial justifications that 

Atticus gives Jean-Louise for his 
behavior are incredibly uncom-
fortable. There’s no escaping it. 
While he agrees with his liberal 
daughter that black people are 
human, he does not believe they 
have the capacity for decision-
making or responsibility. It 
seems unnatural to hear such 
bigotry spew from the mouth 
of the man who stood 20 years 
earlier in front of his entire town 
to defend Tom Robinson and 
said “Gentlemen, if there’s one 
slogan in this world I believe it is 
this, equal rights for all, special 
privileges for none.” When we 
flash back to this moment with 
a young Scout, the shock and 
hurt that she experiences with 
this revelation about her father 
seems entirely legitimate.

And yet, the discovery about 

Atticus does not inherently con-
tradict the beloved characters of 
“To Kill A Mockingbird.” Atticus 
is first and foremost a law-abid-
ing man, and his defense of Tom 
Robinson was based on the fact 
that Robinson was an innocent 
man being accused of a crime 
he did not commit. A clear dis-
tinction is made between Atti-
cus and more infamous White 
Supremacists – Atticus would 
never physically hurt someone 
or break the law to uphold his 
beliefs. His less violent form 
of racism possibly comes as a 
surprise, but does not come out 
of nowhere. After living in the 
deep South for 72 years, Atticus, 
a straight white male with some 
socio-economic power, does not 
want to change a system that 

favors himself and his offspring. 
If this situation were applied to 
anyone besides the most famous 
seeker of justice in modern lit-
erature, the conclusion that in 
these circumstances, this person 
would subscribe to paternalistic 
racism would not be eccentric.

But he’s not some random rac-

ist. And our connection to the 
person that he was in the first 
book is what fuels the fire of the 
second. Like the rest of “Go Set 
A Watchman,” the ties that it has 
to the characters from “To Kill 
A Mockingbird” prove to be it’s 
shining moments of glory. The 
narrator Jean-Louise, who in 
the second novel has made the 
switch from her wise beyond 
her years first person voice to 
a more stiff third person one, 
comes to life when she dwells on 
her childhood. Without the first 
book, it would be too much to 
expect readers to care about how 
much Jean-Louise has changed, 
or that she doesn’t speak to Dill, 
or that Atticus is part of the citi-
zen’s council. “Go Set a Watch-
man” is a fine addition to its 
predecessor, but would wobble if 
it tried to stand on its own.

“To Kill A Mockingbird” has 

its roots in “Go Set A Watch-
man.” An editor saw the passion 
of the childhood scenes and 
asked Harper Lee to write a 
book twenty years earlier from 
the point of the view of young 
Scout. Without “Watchman”, we 
wouldn’t have the entrancing 
book that will make countless 
young Americans actually enjoy 
English class. It’s enjoyable to 
read because even after not pen-
ning another book for over 40 
years – Lee sure can write.

Ambitious ‘Narcos’ 

TV REVIEW

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

“Sometimes truth is stranger 

than fiction,” “Narcos” ’s nar-
rator, DEA agent Steve Murphy 
(Boyd 
Hol-

brook, 
“Run 

All 
Night”), 

meditates. 
“There’s a rea-
son 
magical 

realism 
was 

born in Colom-
bia. It’s a coun-
try 
where 

dreams and reality are conflated, 
where in their heads people fly as 
high as Icarus. But even magical 
realism has its limits.”

Following the rise and rule 

of infamous Colombian cocaine 
kingpin Pablo Escobar (Wagner 
Moura, “Elite Squad”), “Nar-
cos” crafts a sweeping narrative 
of corruption and brutality that 
spans nearly two decades. The 
life of Escobar is simultaneously 
alluring and repulsive. Filled 
with wealth, sex and excess, the 
lifestyle is reminiscent of the 
gangsters on display in films 
such as “Goodfellas,” a fantasy 
of riches and dreams come true. 
But, like its American counter-
part, “Narcos” displays the sick-
ening foundation that built this 
empire and the toxic effect it has 
on those involved, as Escobar 
grows more brutal and paranoid 
and violence becomes the only 
answer.

On the other side of the law, 

the American Murphy, his part-
ner Javier Peña (Pedro Pas-
cal, “Game of Thrones”) and 
Colombian Colonel Horatio Car-
illo (Maurice Compte, “A Walk 
Among the Tombstones”) are 
tasked with taking down Esco-
bar. The trio is a mixed bag. Pas-
cal highlights the charisma he 
had as Oberyn Martell in “Game 
of Thrones” in his portrayal of 
Peña, a smooth veteran who 
knows that capturing Escobar 
requires some extralegal means 

as 
bureaucracy 
continuously 

interferes. Carillo shares this 
sentiment, but has the added 
burden of calling the country 
home and seeing it turn into a 
battlefield.

Moura handles Escobar with 

a deft performance that human-
izes the man but never glosses 
over how monstrous he can be. 
He gives money to the poor, 
but later plagues his homeland 
with car bombings so he can 
get what he wants. Escobar is a 
violent man but not a dumb one, 
as Moura displays intelligence 
behind every move. Nowhere 
is this better on display than 
Escobar’s introduction. Under 
the direction of José Padilha 
(the director of “Elite Squad”), 
Moura as Escobar intimidates 
several border guards into sub-
mission, blatantly displaying the 
items he smuggles. The camera 
lingers on Escobar as he casu-
ally brings up the names of the 
soldiers, then the names of their 
wives and children, giving them 
the choice, “Plata o plomo,” (sil-
ver or lead). Shot in one take, 
the scene is a chilling display of 
control with Padilha, who is also 
a producer for the series. The 
standard for “Narcos” is estah-
blished early on by capturing 
Columbia’s paradox of aesthetic 
beauty against social suffering 
and violence.

Murphy isn’t as effective. 

Portrayed 
with 
a 
southern 

drawl by Holbrook, Murphy 
is the new guy thrust into the 
jungles and slums of Colombia. 
Murphy’s story is one of initial 
patriotism and disillusionment, 
giving way to the realization 
that “Good and bad, they’re 
relative concepts.” Only when 
Murphy plunges into the rabbit 
hole of obsession with bring-
ing Escobar to justice does he 
become 
somewhat 
interest-

ing. However, some unhinged 
moments, like when he shoots 
the tires of a frustrated cabbie, 
still feel forced.

The most truly irritating 

aspect of Murphy derives from 
his near constant narration. 
While occasionally offering a 
clever or sobering observation, 
“Narcos” ’s voiceover serves 
mainly 
as 
an 
information 

dump, supplying facts about 
Escobar’s 
dynasty 
or 
plot 

information. Considering the 
scope of the series, it’s under-
standable that narration will 
be used, but it’s so constant and 
occasionally unnecessary in its 
hand-holding that it becomes 
an annoyance.

The beast that is the real life 

story behind “Narcos” is hard to 
tame, and though the show tries 
its best to wrestle with as much 
as it can, it sometimes loses its 
grip. With reflections on Ameri-
can interventionism, the nature 
of good and evil and the ineffec-
tive hypocrisy of bureaucracy 
among its themes, “Narcos” has 
a lot to say within its first 10 epi-
sodes, creating a balancing act 
that alternatively soars and tum-
bles with the execution. The 
show uses actual news footage 
to inconsistently enforce these 
ideas. At times the use drives 
home the reality of the situation: 
that truth is crazier than fiction. 
However, at times it feels like a 
blatant cost cutting measure, 
considering the use of the Palace 
of Justice siege, a pivotal event 
is almost entirely stock footage.

“Narcos” may struggle at 

times handling its ambition, 
but it still delivers enough of 
its initial promise – crafting a 
fascinating portrayal of one of 
history’s most brutal criminals 
and the dark world surrounding 
him.

ALBUM REVIEW
Miley is clueless 
but fascinating

By ADAM THEISEN

Senior Arts Editor

Just a few months ago, I would 

have been so excited for a new 
Miley Cyrus album. Earlier in the 
summer, 
the 

singer 
started 

posting YouTube 
videos 
of 
her 

“Backyard 
Ses-

sions,” a series of 
stripped-down 
cover songs per-
formed by Cyrus 
and friends like 
Joan Jett, Laura 
Jane Grace and 
Ariana Grande. 
Where 
these 

performances showcased Cyrus’s 
great, matured, husky voice, her 
newly launched Happy Hippie 
Foundation and smart quotes about 
gender fluidity and the epidemic of 
homelessness seemed to highlight 
a newfound awareness and social 
consciousness.

These interviews and videos 

seemed to make clear that Cyrus’s 
next project would be dramati-
cally different from her previous 
full-length: 2013’s Bangerz, a record 
with a pair of great singles and a 
lot of mediocre, faux-provocative, 
blackface-wearing 
pop 
music. 

Cyrus seemed poised for an organ-
ic-sounding folk/country record 
that, for better or worse, would 
announce her arrival as a legiti-
mate, critically respectable artist.

But Cyrus has demonstrated 

in the last couple weeks that she 
can still be totally clueless about 
subjects like race and appropria-
tion, and she blows up any expec-
tations of artistic evolution from 
the second her new album begins. 
The very first line from the first 
song, which you might have heard 
if you watched her “outrageous” 
performance at the VMAs, is a 
heavily distorted “Yeah, I smoke 
pot” that gets laid over a standard 
trap beat practically cut-and-
pasted from Bangerz. “Dooo It!” is 
a disappointing, near-insufferable 
beginning that feels forced and 
immature and sits in this weird 
negative zone between catchy pop 
and experimental avant-garde, 
picking up the good characteris-
tics of neither.

The good news, though, is that 

“Dooo It!” might actually be one 
of the low points of the entire proj-
ect. Recorded with psych-rock vets 
The Flaming Lips, Miley Cyrus and 
her Dead Petz is a 90-minute mess 
that you can’t help but appreciate 
even as it goes on forever and ever. 
The record is like a garage sale 
of Cyrus’s talents and ambitions, 
with different aspects of her art-

istry haphazardly hung and strewn 
about throughout its runtime. The 
sequencing is nonexistent — you 
might as well just play the whole 
thing on shuffle — and I really can’t 
imagine what this record is meant 
for or who will enjoy it, but it’s 
exciting to see a young artist exper-
iment like Cyrus does, and you’re 
bound to find moments of greatness 
within its long, winding runtime.

The first half of Dead Petz can 

sometimes feel like flipping through 
a 500-page textbook looking for the 
one quote you need to cite in a paper. 
Frustrating but at times rewarding, 
very long, unmemorable songs are 
mixed in with obnoxiousness and 
beauty. Second track “Karen Don’t 
Be Sad” sounds remarkably similar 
to “Holes” by Mercury Rev, a band 
with whom the Lips have always 
been closely compared. It’s one 
of the stronger songs, with Cyrus 
showing instead of telling her drug 
use, letting it actually inform her 
work instead of just yelling about 
how high she is. However, songs 
like “Something About Space Dude” 
and “Space Boots” go on for way too 
long without any clear goals. These 
tracks sound like forgotten Flam-
ing Lips album cuts recorded with 
a new frontperson, and it feels odd 
that Cyrus would choose to make 
this record with a veteran band in 
their 50s when she wants her sound 
to be so forward-thinking. Else-
where, Mike Will Made It plays a 
key role, and though he delivers 
the danceable strength that made 
him famous, his presence on songs 
feels like much more of a callback 
to Bangerz than this album should 
be. Cyrus herself often sounds like 
she’s holding back, keeping her 
voice subtle or distorted instead of 
impressing by letting loose. On the 
awful forced monologue of “BB 
Talk,” she sounds like an actress 
reading off lines for a character she 
doesn’t even know, but other times, 
she can tap into a loose, breathy 
singer-songwriter mode that serves 
her well.

“Milky Milky Milk,” track 10 

of 23, then becomes either the 
moment of abandonment or the 
point of no return. Another dreamy, 
jokey track with mediocre elec-
tronic experimentation, it’s a huge 
swing and a disappointing miss. 
But get past that, and the next 
song is “Cyrus Skies,” a slow, tense 
breakdown of a tune with despair-
ing vocals and minimal instru-
mentation. That track kicks off a 
hypnotic comedown that produces 
Miley Cyrus and her Dead Petz’s 
most compelling work, with songs 
that are still messy and deconstruc-
tive but contain soul and complex-
ity. There are still eye-roll moments 
where you really have to wonder 

how Cyrus thinks getting drunk 
and fucked up is worth bragging 
about, but other times, she shows 
hints of chameleonic geniuses 
like Lou Reed or Bjork. “I Get So 
Scared” is a guitar-strummer that 
gives the best glimpse of what 
a folksier Cyrus record would 
sound like, while “Lighter” is a 
Cocteau Twins/M83-style night-
time driving song that once again 
uses drugs as an influence rather 
than the whole substance of a 
song. “1 Sun,” meanwhile, takes 
MIA’s busy electro-punk chaos 
and turns it into this preachy 
garage-punk rave-up.

By the end of Dead Petz you 

feel like you’ve been swarmed by 
ideas and entranced by the unfa-
miliar tricks of Miley Cyrus. It’s 
worth asking “What the fuck is 
she doing?” here and there, but 
it’s also fun to sit back and absorb 
take in her obvious potential bril-
liance. The record concludes with 
a couple of twee piano ballads 
surrounding 
the 
questionable 

appropriation of “Miley Tibetan 
Bowlz.” “Pablow the Blowfish” 
made me smile in its cleverness 
even though it’s a eulogy for a 
dead pet, while “Twinkle Song” 
works because it’s one of the few 
Dead Petz tracks that puts Cyrus 
directly in the spotlight. She 
interesting and talented enough 
that you care when she opens 
her mouth and says something 
honest, even if she’s just talking 
about some dream she had, and 
when the album closes with her 
truly showing off how wild and 
unhinged her voice can get (think 
Stevie Nicks on “Edge of Seven-
teen”), it’s truly satisfying.

The weirdest thing about 

Miley Cyrus and her Dead Petz, 
to me, is how truly unclassi-
fiable it is. That works in its 
favor, as it’s worth listening 
to at least for its experimental 
uniqueness, but it also means 
it doesn’t fit into any easy rec-
ommendation. I don’t know 
who would love this album, or 
when you would want to play 
it. I only know that its creator 
has plenty of talent and ambi-
tion, even if she screws up a lot, 
and I love hearing her when she 
succeeds. Drugged-up with her 
head spinning, feeling fuzzy as 
she explores all that she’s capa-
ble of, Cyrus still hasn’t escaped 
from the influence of the art-
ists who inspire her or from her 
own occasional bad judgments, 
but on Miley Cyrus & Her Dead 
Petz, you can hear her pressing 
her hands against the walls, 
pushing out to try and make 
something truly original.

BOOK REVIEW
Coates demands 
greater social change

By KARL WILLIAMS

Daily Arts Writer

“In America, it is traditional to 

destroy the black body—it is heri-
tage,” writes Ta-Nehisi Coates, a 
national 
cor-

respondent for 
The 
Atlantic, 

in his newest 
book “Between 
the World and 
Me.” 
Coates 

wrote the book 
as an admoni-
tory letter to 
his son about 
the dangers of 
being Black in 
contemporary 
America, where news of an Afri-
can American’s death at the hands 
of the police has become almost a 
rote expectation of weekly life.

Coates surveys history both 

personal and national, creat-
ing an epistolary memoir filled 
with searing social and politi-
cal commentary. He discusses 
his adolescence, fraught with 
the latent violence of the Balti-
more streets and the frequency 
with which it was realized; 
his collegiate years at Howard 
University where he developed 
his intellectual purpose, meet-
ing his wife, his struggles as a 
young writer, etc, and he aug-
ments his memories with caus-
tic, cogent meditations on race 
and American history.

According to Coates, race is 

the legacy of American history. 
Race, and its son racism, is not a 
blight on the otherwise fair face 
of America, but the face itself. The 
plunder and subjugation of Black 
bodies created the wealth and 
power enjoyed mostly by white 
Americans.. These are the foun-
dation of what Coates simply calls 
“the Dream.” As formulated in the 
book, the Dream is a moral efface-
ment, a convenient innocence that 
allows the continuous destruction 
and exploitation of Black bodies.

Coates digs into history quite 

a bit, noting, for example, that 
in the pre-Civil War South 
slaves “were worth four billion 
dollars, more than all of Ameri-
can industry,” but his analysis 
of the contemporary political 
situation, especially his own 
experiences, proves more pow-
erful. In fact, the most compel-
ling part of the book is Coates’s 
telling of the promising life and 
tragic death of Prince Jones, 
a friend and fellow student at 
Howard University. Jones — a 
young, unarmed Black man 
like Michael Brown, Trayvon 
Martin, Tamir Rice, and many 
others — was shot by a police-
man who followed him through 
three jurisdictions in search 
of a suspect who had nothing 
in common with Jones other 
than the brand of their vehicle 
and the color of their skin. The 
officer claimed that Jones tried 
to run him over with his Jeep, 
and, since only one witness 
lived through the encounter, 

the prosecutors believed him. 

Jones’s life differs from the nar-

ratives usually ascribed to Black 
victims of police violence. He was 
affluent, born in the suburbs, a 
stellar student. His mother over-
came abject poverty by attending 
college, becoming a radiologist 
and building a privileged life for 
her son so that he, unlike most 
other 
Black 
children, 
would 

not have to be “twice as good.” 
Jones’s story elucidates a cru-
cial point in “Between the World 
and Me:” that even when African 
Americans achieve the American 
Dream, when they break into the 
suburban landscape “organized 
around pot roasts, blueberry pies, 
fireworks, ice cream sundaes, 
immaculate bathrooms, and small 
toy trucks that were loosed in 
wooded backyards with streams 
and glens,” race imposes a limita-
tion that is both ineluctable and, 
possibly, fatal.

In another intriguing pas-

sage, which is sure to become 
notorious if taken out of context 
enough, Coates says that he did 
not feel sympathy for 9/11 first 
responders: 

“I could see no difference 

between the officer who killed 
Prince Jones and the police who 
died, or the firefighters who 
died. They were not human to 
me. Black, white, or whatever, 
they were the menaces of nature; 
they were the fire, the comet, 
the storm, which could—with no 
justification—shatter my body.”

The attack on the World 

Trade Centers — a place where, 
as Coates notes, slaves were 
once traded — occurred in the 
wake of Prince Jones’s death, an 
event that seems to have shaped 
much of his political views and 
writing since. He’s not being 
contemptuous, but rather bran-
dishing a brutal candor that 
aims to evince the vast dispar-
ity in what the forces of Ameri-
can history, the American state 
and the American legacy mean 
for him and what they mean for 

most citizens. 

In form and theme, “Between 

the World and Me” explicitly 
invokes James Baldwin’s essay 
“My 
Dungeon 
Shook: 
Let-

ter to my Nephew on the One 
Hundredth Anniversary of the 
Emancipation.” He’s more Mal-
colm than Martin, but Coates 
compares better with Baldwin 
than other prominent Black 
intellectual figures, although 
these are all shadows too large 
for any man to fill. 

In his essay, Baldwin writes 

that “it is not permissible 
that the authors of devasta-
tion should also be innocent. 
It is the innocence which con-
stitutes the crime,” an idea 
concurrent in “Between the 
World and Me.” Both writers 
posit an absolute moral cul-
pability in the benefits white 
America enjoys because of 
its enslavement of Black bod-
ies. But Baldwin, writing half 
a century before, has what 
Coates lacks: a legitimate sense 
of hope; he writes that “If you 
know whence you came, there is 
really no limit to where you can 
go.” There are moments when 
Coates let’s rays of hope pilfer 
through (“They made us into a 
race. We made ourselves into a 
people.”), but they don’t break 
his dark evaluation of our con-
temporary situation. After fifty 
years with more stasis than 
change, it feels absurd to expect 
him to share this sentiment.

Coates’s book is not with-

out its faults. At times, he has 
a tendency to generalize, and 
he writes with such severity 
that, in some instances, it seems 
like no progress has been made. 
However, it is easy to point out, 
“we’ve had a Black president,” 
and leave it there. But this is a 
dangerous conciliatory gesture 
that eradicates the impetus for 
change. It is important to real-
ize there has been progress, but 
essential to realize there hasn’t 
been enough.

Jake Rudock’s last stand

N

ine days after Michigan 
hired Jim Harbaugh on 
Dec. 30, change brewed 

at Iowa. It 
arrived in 
the form 
of a depth 
chart. On 
that day, Jake 
Rudock, the 
Hawkeyes’ 
No. 1 
quarterback 
for two years, 
officially 
became a No. 2 quarterback. 
Better opportunities awaited him 
elsewhere.

Eight months later, Rudock’s 

facial expression resided 
somewhere between a scowl 
and a frown for the first hour 
after his debut as Michigan’s 
starting quarterback. It was 
a look of anger, of sadness, of 
disappointment. It was seared 
onto Rudock’s face as he left the 
field when the clock hit zero.

His walk to the locker room 

was slow, even agonizing. 
He kept his helmet in place, 
half-strapped. Rudock stared 
straight forward, the second-to-
last player to enter Michigan’s 
locker room, followed only by 
punter Blake O’Neill, who was 
exchanging pleasantries with 
fellow Australian punter Tom 
Hackett. Rudock spoke to no one. 
He looked at no one.

The look remained with 

Rudock in his postgame press 
conference, when he was 
forced to explain the three 
interceptions and the overthrows 
that might very well have cost 
the Wolverines the first game of 
the season. It was a look telling 
of the situation. His eyes were 
desperate as positives from the 
game escaped him. He took 
blame for the mistakes that 
might have truly been the fault 
of others.

Even afterward, almost an 

hour after the game had ended, 

Rudock maintained the look 
of a man who had blown an 
opportunity. Not necessarily 
the look of someone losing his 
job — he said he felt comfortable 
as Michigan’s quarterback going 
forward — but of someone who 
had come from so far only to 
come up short.

Rudock came to Ann Arbor 

this summer from Iowa, a place 
where he had started 25 games, 
only to be unceremoniously 
left at the altar for a younger 
quarterback before his final 
season. Rudock was never known 
as a stud quarterback, but his 
play allowed him to climb up the 
school record book: He ranks 
eighth in Hawkeyes’ history 
passing touchdowns, passing 
yards and total offense. It still 
wasn’t enough to hold onto his 

starting job.

Rudock threw just five 

interceptions last season, 
making Thursday night’s three 
interceptions in his new venture 
all the more perplexing. He had 
been considered the safe choice 
in Michigan’s 
quarterback 
battle, the wily 
veteran who 
would make 
the key throws 
and take care 
of the ball.

But 

Thursday night 
was not the 
start he had 
envisioned. 
Rudock had the look of a man 
who knew he had 12 chances, 12 
games to finish his career while 

sending a message to detractors. 
It felt like he knew the first of 
those opportunities was wasted 
— he had faltered at a core tenet 
of his position.

“Part of your job as 

quarterback is to protect the ball, 

protect the ball 
and manage 
the game, 
however cliché 
you guys like 
that,” he said.

Rudock, the 

person, has 
proven to be a 
quick thinker, 
fast with his 
tongue and 
conscious of 

every word that leaves his mouth 
when speaking to the media. 
Before the starting quarterback 

position was announced, he 
joked that he knew reporters 
were trying to bait him into 
saying something. Rudock did 
not fall for the trap.

Whether Rudock the 

quarterback is the same quick 
thinker remains to be seen. Jake 
Butt said Monday that Rudock 
could teach the team’s offense, its 
“NFL offense,” to anyone, after 
only one summer. Still, the first 
start in Rudock’s final season was 
far from ideal. The man destined 
to be a one-year stopgap didn’t 
stop the trend of back-breaking 
turnovers that have doomed 
Michigan in recent years.

After Rudock, the future 

of the quarterback position 
at Michigan is murky. John 
O’Korn, Alex Malzone, Wilton 
Speight, Shane Morris, Zach 

Gentry and Brandon Peters 
wait in the wings, potential 
quarterbacks Harbaugh can mold 
into stars. Any one of them could 
conceivably be the team’s starter 
of the future, the next star that 
Harbaugh develops.

But for now, Rudock is the 

guy. Nobody is expecting the 
Wolverines to win the rest of 
their games, or even come close. 
Ohio State and Michigan State 
will make that task even more 
difficult than Utah did last week. 
It could take months before 
Michigan is on that level, or it 
could take a couple of years.

But no matter when the 

winning comes, Michigan fans 
are still hurting. For all of the 
Harbaugh hype and the belief 
that everything will work out, 
the Wolverines still haven’t 
strapped on their helmets and 
beaten a team in front of tens 
of thousands of people. Over 
the course of almost a decade, 
Michigan has turned into a 
laughingstock of sorts, from the 
bully on the block to a punching 
bag. Harbaugh hasn’t fixed that 
yet — nobody possibly could in 
eight months.

This season is a stepping 

stone, a time for the Wolverines 
to prove that they can hang with 
the big boys, that they won’t be 
a team Michigan State can beat 
into submission. The time for 
being a punching bag is drawing 
to a close.

So who better to lead the 

program that has been eaten, 
chewed up and spat back out 
than the guy who already lost 
everything he had worked for 
and is now trying to get it back?

The look on Rudock’s face 

after the opener suggested that 
he’ll use every last fiber of his 
being to make sure his Game One 
mistakes never happen again.

Utah well-prepared for Michigan

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

SALT LAKE CITY — Kyle 

Whittingham wasn’t waiting 
for Jim Harbaugh to tip his 
hand.

Amidst the shroud of mystery 

that surrounded the Michigan 
football team, submerged from 
the public eye for nearly all of 
August, Whittingham simply 
didn’t have time to wait.

He had a game plan to 

prepare, and he wasn’t going to 
rely on media reports to craft it.

“We don’t pay attention to 

what people say (out of camp),” 
Whittingham said. “You don’t 
know if what they say is going to 
be accurate … Very rarely do we 
put much stock into what comes 
out of the opposing camp. It’s 
neither here nor there to us — 
the silence, or whatever, doesn’t 
faze us.”

It showed on Thursday. The 

Wolverines scored a few points 
and made a few stops, but for 
Whittingham, there was little 
to no surprise when it came 
to how they did it. Utah was 
prepared for everything; that 
much was clear in the Utes’ 
24-17 win.

Michigan 
came 
out 
as 

expected, starting the game 
with a give to junior running 
back De’Veon Smith up the 
middle. Utah stuffed him for 
just a two-yard gain, and so it 
began.

The Utes were ready for 

everything 
the 
Wolverines 

threw at them because they 
studied everything they might 
possibly see. Asked about that 
preparation after the game, 
Whittingham answered before 
the reporter could finish his 
question.

“It was tedious. It was 

painstaking,” he said. “A lot of 
it was best-guess scenario, but 
our assistant coaches were on 
the money. The things we saw 
on defense, from there over, 
were exactly what we practiced. 
We practiced more than what 
we saw, but what we did see, we 
had worked on all that.”

At the top of Utah’s list was 

the run game, since Michigan’s 

stable of powerful backs is the 
type that could wear down a 
defense if allowed to get going.

And Smith did his damnedest. 

The junior back broke tackles 
all night long, but Utes just kept 
coming at him. When he shook 
loose an arm tackle, someone 
was there to put a body on him, 
and when he pushed through 
a body, someone was there to 
drag him down.

It 
says 

something 
that 
Smith 

broke a tackle 
on 
almost 

every 
touch, 

but 
still 

averaged just 
2.8 yards per 
carry.

“That 

was 
really 

the 
biggest 

key 
to 
our 

defense, other than the three 
interceptions,” 
Whittingham 

said. “Their (inability) to rush 
the ball how they wanted to was 
the biggest key. … We knew we 
needed to stand toe to toe and 
slug it out, just like we did last 
year and just like we did in ’08.”

If there was anything that 

surprised Utah, it was how 
much Rudock moved around in 
the backfield.

The Utes weren’t prepared 

for Rudock to run as many 
bootlegs as he did, but even that 
never burned them. Utah didn’t 
sack Rudock once on Thursday, 
normally a cornerstone for a 
team that earned the nickname 
“Sack Lake City” for finishing 
with the most sacks in the 
nation in 2014.

But for the most part, the 

Utes won Thursday by knowing 

what 
to 

expect. In an 
opening game 
that 
could 

have brought 
jitters, 
they 

weren’t 
rattled.

Utah senior 

running back 
Devontae 
Booker 
was 

a 
dark-horse 

Heisman 

candidate 
coming 
into 
the 

season, and Michigan kept 
him in check for most of the 
first half. But the Utes knew 
Michigan had a stout line. They 
weren’t surprised.

They kept with it, changing 

their style up to accommodate 
an advantage on the outside, 
and the Wolverines’ physical 
defensive line began to wear 
down. Suddenly, Utah’s run 

plays started working again.

Through the first half, the 

Utes had 21 carries for 47 yards. 
In the second, they ran it 16 
times for 82 — 5.1 yards per 
carry.

“We knew what was coming,” 

Booker said. “We had to watch 
like a million different tapes of 
film, we just prepared ourselves 
throughout this week, and it 
paid off tonight.”

They watched film from 

Stanford and the 49ers to see 
what to expect from Harbaugh, 
USC for offensive coordinator 
Tim Drevno, the Jacksonville 
Jaguars to see what to expect 
from passing game coordinator 
Jedd Fisch, Iowa to scout 
Rudock and Florida to evaluate 
defensive 
coordinator 
DJ 

Durkin.

Everyone on the staff was 

prepared, right down to the 
men handing out postgame 
meals.

When Whittingham walked 

out to the field after his 
postgame 
press 
conference, 

he did an interview with the 
Pac-12 Network, then turned 
to the guy passing out ribs 
from Ruby River Steakhouse. 
Whittingham asked him to save 
some for him.

“Two on your desk, coach,” 

he said.

Harbaugh brings back helmet 
stickers to spark competition

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Everything Michigan coach 

Jim Harbaugh has done since 
taking over the Michigan football 
team has been synonymous with 
competition.

He wants his injured players 

to cut their recovery time in half, 
keeps score of his quarterbacks’ 
every move on and off the field 
to decide the starter and even 
pushed the Wolverines to get the 
annual team photo taken in under 
10 minutes to set a “new record.”

But 
on 
Sunday, 
Michigan 

officially brought back one of its 
longstanding competitive efforts, 
handing out helmet stickers after 
the team’s 24-17 loss to Utah.

Once a staple during Bo 

Schembechler and Gary Moeller’s 
tenures as Michigan coaches, 
the stickers are used to not only 
reward good effort, but also to 
promote friendly competition 
among teammates.

“I think it’s awesome,” said 

junior tight end Jake Butt. 
“It’s another way to create an 
environment 
of 
competition. 

They’re pretty 
sweet. We got 
them put on 
our 
helmet 

the other day 
... I want my 
helmet to be 
decked out by 
the end of the 
season.

“Everyone’s competing. You 

don’t want to be the guy with an 
empty helmet at the end of the 
year.”

Butt, who had eight receptions 

for 93 yards and one score in 
the game, was second on the 
team with eight helmet stickers. 
Redshirt junior wide receiver 
Amara Darboh, who had eight 
catches for 101 yards and a 
touchdown, tallied nine.

The scoring system, according 

to the two, is a mix of playing in 

a fixed percentage of the game, 
reaching individual and unit 
goals and showing mistake-
free play when the game tape is 

reviewed.

“Coach 

Harbaugh 
preaches 
competition 
from day one,” 
Darboh 
said. 

“When you go 
out on the field 
and do your 

job, you’ll be rewarded.”

Though competition is the 

most obvious goal of the stickers’ 
use, Harbaugh noted on Monday 
that small mistakes proved to 
be the Wolverines’ downfall in 
the loss. Be it freshman receiver 
Grant 
Perry’s 
“not-precise” 

route running, Rudock’s fourth-
quarter pick-six or false starts on 
the offensive line, Harbaugh felt 
his team was often out of sync, 
undermining its potential.

By using video review to 

pinpoint the missed plays and 
assignments, Harbaugh hopes to 
put the emphasis not only on the 
big plays, but also on consistency 
throughout the game as well.

“The precision of the unit has 

to be all 11 (Michigan players 
on the field),” Harbaugh said. 
“The times when we did have 
breakdowns (it was) one guy, 
one breakdown, one missed 
assignment ... (It) ended up being 
costly.”

“But all of it is fixable, and 

that’s what we’re working hard 
to do.”

NOTES: Harbaugh said that 

sophomore wide receiver Freddy 
Canteen and senior running 
back Drake Johnson are both 
in practice, but haven’t yet been 
cleared to play in Saturday’s 
game … After both were listed as 
starting quarterback last week, 
graduate transfer Jake Rudock 
was officially listed ahead of 
junior Shane Morris in Monday’s 
depth chart.

‘M’ finishes trip 
with two wins

Wolverines earn 
first two victories 

of 2015 season

By ALEX KHALIFEH

Daily Sports Writer

For the past three years, the 

Michigan field hockey team 
has dropped its early-season 
matchups 
against 
North 
Carolina 
and Wake 
Forest 
in 

the 
ACC/

Big Ten Challenge. In those 
seasons, Michigan was able 
to bounce back and ring up 
consecutive victories after its 
unsucessful start.

Like previous seasons, the 

Wolverines dropped their first 
two games against the Tar 
Heels and the Demon Deacons a 
week ago. Once again, Michigan 
recovered for two straight wins 
at Providence and Fairfield.

The 
Wolverines 
defeated 

the Friars (0-4) on Friday, 1-0. 
Despite the win, it seemed 
Michigan (2-2) was in a bit of a 
dry spell offensively. Its offense 
had six shots on goal against 
Providence, and through three 
games, the Wolverines had 
found the back of the net just 
twice.

But the offensive stagnation 

disappeared 
Sunday, 
when 

Michigan shut out the Stags 
(1-2) in a 4-0 victory.

“As you go along on the 

season, 
you 
start 
figuring 

out combinations and people 
start getting into a rhythm,” 
said Michigan coach Marcia 
Pankratz. “It was really nice 
seeing some of the goal-scoring 
threats from a multitude of 

players.”

A variety of players made 

an impact in the Wolverines’ 
victory, as senior backfielder 
Lauren Thomas, senior forward 
Shannon 
Scavelli, 
junior 

forward Courtney Enge and 
freshman forward Emma Way 
all aided in the scoring punch.

Both wins were highlighted 

by two goalies — sophomore 
Sam Swenson and redshirt 
junior Chris Lueb.

Sunday, the goalkeeping duo 

combined for four saves, with 
Swenson tallying five saves on 
the weekend, including two off 
a Friars’ penalty corner in the 
first half.

“The 
team 
feels 
really 

confident with either (Swenson 
or Lueb) in the goal cage,” 
Pankratz said. “They’re smart, 
working hard and they organize 
their defense.”

On the offensive side, Enge 

proved to be a difference-
maker. She scored the lone 
goal Friday, and kicked off the 
scoring against Fairfield.

“(Enge) is one of the fastest 

players 
in 
the 
Big 
Ten,” 

Pankratz said. “She’s always 
been quite dangerous with her 
speed, and now she’s adding 
being dangerous as a goal 
scoring threat. Both of those 
goals were beautiful tip-ins off 
the right post. I was really glad 
to see her contribute.”

Following their slow start to 

the season, the Wolverines were 
able to click when it mattered 
most, mustering 10 and 12 
shots in each of their respective 
games.

“In every game, every part of 

the field — forward, midfield, 
defense — connection is the 
No. 1 thing,” Enge said. “The 
chemistry is there, it’s just 
going to increase as the season 
goes by.”

FOOTBALL
‘M’ fan turnout 
strong at Utah

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

SALT LAKE CITY — In the 

eight months since Jim Har-
baugh was hired as the football 
coach at Michigan, the Wolver-
ine fan base has showered him 
with nearly unconditional love, 
the kind reserved for a former 
quarterback returned home. But 
this week, one fan took his devo-
tion to the next level.

Ross Mitton, a Michigan fan 

from Windsor, Ontario, Canada, 
drove 26 hours, starting Mon-
day, to see Harbaugh’s Wolverine 
coaching debut in Salt Lake City 
on Thursday night. His ride? A 
converted ambulance plastered 
with Michigan-related images 
that he purchased in February 
2014. Mitton calls it his Mbu-
lance.

Mitton, a 62-year-old finan-

cial adviser, worked with a 
graphic designer to deck out the 
vehicle. Both sides of the back 
of the ambulance are covered 
by images of Michigan Stadium. 
Bo Schembechler’s “The team, 
the team, the team,” quote is 
scrawled across the top of one 
side of the van; “Those who stay 
will be champions” is written on 
the back door. 

References to Mitton’s Cana-

dian heritage are all over the 
Mbulance. A maize and blue 
Canadian flag marked his tailgate 
spot, and he wears a shirt that 
says “The Blue Loonies,” a refer-
ence to the Canadian coin and the 
nickname that Mitton and many 
of his Canadian friends who are 
Michigan fans have given them-
selves. “Go blue, eh!” is written on 
one side opposite Schembechler’s 
“The team” quote.

“Some guys have sports cars, 

some guys have girlfriends, this 
is my hobby,” said Mitton, who is 
married.

Many of the holdovers from 

the vehicle’s time as an ambu-
lance remain, but now have the 
Michigan logo on them, such 
as the ambulance’s jump seat 

next to the side door which has 
maize and blue padding. Mitton 
replaced the ambulance’s oxygen 
tank with a keg. He jokes that he 
replaced one lifesaving device 
with another.

Mitton had long been con-

sidering the trip to Utah for the 
season opener, but Harbaugh’s 
hiring last December sealed the 
deal. He estimated that more 
than 300 people, many Michi-
gan fans, stopped by his tailgate 
Thursday.

“When Harbaugh was hired, it 

was like, ‘Yeah, OK, we’re going,” 
Mitton said.

Even Utah fans participated 

in the Harbaugh love. Student 
Emran Behashti roamed the 
parking lot before the game, 
dressed in an outfit that mim-
icked Harbaugh’s, albeit with a 
Utah hat. He wore what he called 
a Harbaugh sweater vest, a pen 
hanging from his neck, Nike 
shoes, a headset and, of course, 
khakis purchased at Walmart. 
Behashti carried a mock play-
book with him as well that 
contained numerous messages 
pertaining to the game, some of 
which are unprintable.

Behashti aimed to have fun 

with his outfit, adding that he 
wasn’t really sure how he felt 
about Harbaugh.

“I do and I don’t,” Behashti 

said when asked if he liked Har-
baugh.

He was disappointed that Har-

baugh once benched former Ute 
Alex Smith when he coached the 
San Francisco 49ers. He said that 
outweighed the fact that Smith 
reached the Super Bowl with 
Harbaugh as his coach.

But of course, Michigan fans 

were most excited to see Har-
baugh. Dan Fitzgerald, a Michi-
gan alum who graduated in 2005, 
tailgated with Mitton before 
the game. Most of his friends 
couldn’t make it to the game, so 
he decided to make the trip from 
Michigan alone.

“I was like, ‘I can’t miss this,’ ” 

Fitzgerald said.

“I want my 
helmet to be 
decked out.”

MOVING IN

4B — September 8, 2015
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Back to school

S

ALT LAKE CITY — 
Sorry folks, summer’s 
over.

The 

return to 
school is 
a tough 
time for 
everyone, 
and the 
Michigan 
football 
team is no 
exception.

It happens 

every 
September: The radiant 
sunshine of summer is 
replaced with humming 
fluorescent lights, the freedom 
and optimism crushed with a 
strong dose of reality.

This change often produces 

back-to-school moments that 
serve as a stark reminder that 
it isn’t summer anymore. It 
can be misspelling an easy 
word after three months off, 
struggling with basic math, 
forgetting your notebook 
or, as many cartoons depict, 
forgetting to put on your pants.

Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh didn’t forget his 
pants — it’s nearly impossible 
to forget those enormous 
khakis at this point — but 
back-to-school moments were 
aplenty for the Wolverines on 
Thursday.

After a summer glimmering 

with good times and optimism, 
it felt like the first day of 
school prior to kickoff. Over 
1,100 Michigan fans from 
all over the country came 
together at the Michigan 
Alumni Salt Lake City 
chapter’s tailgate, giddily 
discussing their summers, 
Jim Harbaugh and the endless 
hope of Michigan football.

But class had been in session 

for mere minutes before the 
Wolverines found themselvews 
on their heels with an early 

test against Utah. And from 
the opening drive to the onside 
kick that flew out of bounds, 
the back-to-school moments 
proved to be the difference 
between passing and failing.

The offensive line, returning 

all of its starters, committed 
critical false starts in its 
first time playing in front 
of a crowd since November. 
Sophomore safety Jabrill 
Peppers blew coverage in 
the second quarter that 
resulted in a 20-yard gain. 
Freshman receiver Grant 
Perry miscommunicated with 
graduate 
transfer 
quarterback 
Jake Rudock, 
resulting in 
two first-half 
picks.

Rudock 

had the 
strongest 
reminder 
of all how 
quickly 
a summer’s worth of 
anticipation can disappear. 
Midway through what looked 
to be a game-tying drive 
with eight minutes to go in 
the fourth quarter, Rudock 
targeted Perry again on third 
down, but Utah cornerback 
Justin Thomas took it to the 
house instead.

The potential 14-point swing 

from that play alone could be 
seen as the difference in the 
game.

The silver lining for 

Michigan fans is that, this 
year, the mistakes at Utah 
were simply that — mistakes. 
A bad team wouldn’t have 
outgained the Utes; a lazy 
team wouldn’t have pieced 
together a touchdown drive 
when everyone else in the 
stadium thought it was over; a 
poorly coached team wouldn’t 
have played better with each 

passing quarter.

Speaking of coaching, 

Harbaugh — who had been 
away from the college game 
longer than anyone else in 
the program — had his share 
of back-to-school moments 
as well. There were few 
controversial decisions or 
missteps, but with each 
barking order and each time 
he placed his hands on his 
hips came a reminder that he 
works with the same mistake-
prone, wide-eyed students 
who went 5-7 last season, not 
freshly picked professionals 

who can 
be signed, 
released and 
traded away 
on a whim.

Harbaugh 

may have 
been the 
biggest name 
in college 
football all 
summer, but 
dominating 

school is a different beast, and 
it doesn’t happen overnight.

There’s no shame in a one-

score loss on the road to the 
Utes — a borderline top-25 
team that won nine games last 
year — but it’s clear that the 
Wolverines have homework 
to do.

“For our football team, 

there were a lot of positives,” 
Harbaugh said. “(But also) 
some things to build on, some 
things to grow from in a lot 
of areas. I’m already thinking 
about them, ready to attack 
them.”

That’s good for the 

Wolverines, because though 
school doesn’t officially start 
until Sept. 8, the next test is in 
nine days.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh lost his highly anticipated Michigan coaching debut Thursday at Utah.
Utah spoils Harbaugh’s 
debut in Salt Lake City

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

SALT LAKE CITY — Six 

Michigan fans spanning three 
generations sat around a table at 
the Alumni Association’s tailgate 
before the football team opened 
its 
2015 

season 
Thursday 
night. 
The 
youngest 
was 

Jason Liess, a junior at the 
University. The oldest were 
his grandparents, Jerome and 
Enid. Jerome sat reminiscing 
about two glorious memories of 
Michigan football: one 29 years 
ago, and one 39 years before that.

Jerome 
witnessed 
both 

memories, retelling them to the 
family and friends sitting next 
to him. Together, they thought 
maybe, just maybe, Thursday 
night would be one of those 
nights they would talk about 
while sitting around a table 29 
years from now.

But it wasn’t. A day that 

began with celebration ended 
with a thud, and the team 
slowly walked off the field after 
a 24-17 defeat, with Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh and four 
players taking 
questions in a 
cramped, dim 
room at the 
stadium.

The 
Liess 

family 
got 

tickets 
for 

the 
game 

from 
Mark 

Messner, 
a 

two-time 
All-American defensive tackle 
who played with Harbaugh on 
Bo Schembechler’s Michigan 
teams in the 80s. Jerome told 
the story of when Messner 
recovered a fumble to help the 
Wolverines win the Fiesta Bowl 
in 1986.

Thirty-nine years before that, 

Jerome, then in high school, 
went to see Michigan play 
Wisconsin in Madison the year 
Fritz Crisler’s “Mad Magicians” 
went undefeated and won the 
national 
championship. 
On 

a rainy day at Camp Randall 
Stadium, the Wolverines, led 
by Bob Chappuis and Jack 

Weisenburger, stormed past the 
Badgers, 40-6.

In the present, when the pack 

of Michigan fans walked to Rice-
Eccles Stadium to watch the 
Wolverines play Utah, there was 
no magic to be had. Michigan 
had every chance to pull ahead 
for good, but never did.

Ultimately, it ended when 

fifth-year senior Jake Rudock 
threw his third interception 
of the night into the hands of 
Utah’s Justin Thomas, who ran 
it back 55 yards for a touchdown. 
The score then stood at 24-10, 
Utah, with just 7:58 to play.

“I thought I could get it to 

him, but it kind of jumped on 
me,” Rudock said. “Should have 
obviously, in hindsight, thrown 
it away. I thought I could get it 
in there.”

The 
Wolverines 
couldn’t 

score on their next possession, 
and though they added a 
consolation touchdown with 54 
seconds to play, they couldn’t 
recover the ensuing onside 
kick.

Michigan trailed by seven at 

halftime, and though both teams 
went on long drives to start the 
second half, Michigan’s ended 

in 
a 
missed 

field goal and 
Utah’s ended 
in a perfect 
fake jet sweep, 
allowing 
quarterback 
Travis Wilson 
to 
stroll 

untouched 
into the end 
zone 
and 

double the lead.

Still, the Wolverines marched 

75 yards down the field on their 
next drive, finishing with a 
19-yard touchdown toss from 
Rudock to junior tight end Jake 
Butt through double coverage. 
The record crowd of 47,825 at 
Rice-Eccles Stadium quieted 
down, and Michigan saw an 
opportunity.

“It just fueled us up more to go 

out there and get a stop on third 
down,” said senior defensive 
lineman Chris Wormley. “We 
were right in the game up until 
that last drive, so I don’t think 
there was ever a point where we 

thought, ‘Oh, man, here we go 
again.’ ”

Utah moved the ball on the 

ensuing series, but kicker Andy 
Phillips missed a 46-yard field 
goal. It was a rare second miss 
of the night for Phillips — giving 
the Wolverines the ball back, 
giving them an opportunity for 
a magical moment in a sloppy 
game. But the pick-six followed 
soon thereafter.

It was a rocky Michigan 

debut for Rudock, the graduate 
transfer 
from 
Iowa, 
who 

finished 27-for-43 with 279 
yards, two touchdowns and 
three 
interceptions. 
His 

yardage total was the highest 
for a Michigan quarterback 
since 2013, but the turnovers 
proved to be his downfall.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense, 

expected to be even more 
reliable than Rudock, also had 
some miscues. Utah cruised 
down the field for 63 yards in 
nine plays and a 30-yard field 
goal on the opening drive, then 
did so again to retake the lead 
with a touchdown drive in the 
second quarter. Utes running 
back Devontae Booker carried 
22 times for 69 yards and a 
touchdown, Wilson 12 times for 
53 and another score. The only 
turnover Michigan forced was 
an interception on a Hail Mary 
at the end of the first half.

“For the defense, nothing 

really 
surprised 
us,” 
said 

senior defensive lineman Chris 
Wormley. “They did exactly 
what we scouted for the last two 
weeks.”

Butt and redshirt junior 

Amara Darboh each caught 
eight 
passes 
and 
one 

touchdown, Butt for 93 yards 
and Darboh for 101.

Now they head home after a 

game so many had anticipated 
for so long, the team included.

“Every game, the goal is to 

win the next game, and that 
was our next game,” Harbaugh 
said. “We prepared well for it, 
worked hard for it — it was a 
pinnacle. That’s your next game. 
You build for that. We’ll do the 
same next week, and everything 
that happens from here on in is 
what matters the most, so that’s 
how we’ll approach it.”

“They did 

exactly what we 
scouted for the 
last two weeks.”

Turnovers plague Rudock 
in season-opening defeat

Grad transfer 

throws three picks, 

one returned for 

game-clinching TD

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

SALT LAKE CITY — Jake 

Rudock did not remove his 
helmet as he walked off the 
field when the clock hit zero in 
his Michigan football debut. He 
traveled alone, acknowledging 
none of the chaos behind him 
as Utah celebrated its 24-17 
victory.

Rudock, 
who 
threw 
just 

five interceptions last season 
in 345 attempts for Iowa, had 
just thrown three picks in 
43 attempts the first time he 
donned the Michigan uniform 
in a game. The debut was not 
the one he had hoped for. 
Rudock did not emit anything 
vaguely resembling a smile in 
his postgame press conference.

He had been informed just 

days earlier that he would 
start the season opener, having 
defeated junior Shane Morris in 
a battle that lasted almost the 
entirety of fall camp. Rudock 
had widely been considered the 
safe choice, sure-handed with 
the ball and unlikely to turn it 
over. But after his first game as 
a Wolverine, Rudock was left to 
explain his mistakes.

The 
fifth-year 
senior 

characterized 
each 
of 
his 

interceptions 
differently. 

The first, a pick that ended a 
54-yard drive when Michigan 
had marched to Utah’s 21-yard 
line, 
was 
the 
result 
of 
a 

miscommunication 
between 

himself and freshman wide 
receiver Grant Perry. As the 
veteran in the situation, Rudock 
was willing to shoulder most of 
the blame.

“Part 
of 
your 
job 
as 

quarterback is to protect the 

ball, protect the ball and manage 
the game, however cliché you 
guys like that,” Rudock said. 
“It’s just, obviously, you don’t 
want to throw picks.”

Rudock classified the second, 

also intended for Perry, a 
“bad ball,” a mistake that was 
completely his fault. The third 
interception, when Rudock’s 
intended target was in man 
coverage, was different. Before 
he threw the ball, which Utah 
cornerback 
Justin 
Thomas 

returned 
55 

yards 
for 
a 

touchdown, 
Rudock 
thought 
he 

was 
making 

a 
sound 

decision. 
In 

hindsight, 
he 
said, 
he 

wished he had 
thrown 
the 

ball away.

After that final pick, the 

one that seemingly crushed 
Michigan’s chances for victory 
by allowing the Utes to extend 
their lead to 14 once again, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, 
making a debut of his own, 
albeit a more publicized one, 
wrapped his arm around his 
quarterback 
as 
they 
stood 

alone on the sideline. Harbaugh 
consoled Rudock, assuring him 
that Thomas had merely made a 
good play.

“He tried to stick it in there, 

and it went the other way,” 
Harbaugh said. “Welcome to 
football.”

After the game, Harbaugh 

said 
he 
considered 
only 

Rudock’s second interception 
to be a bad throw. Otherwise, 
he believed his quarterback 
had made the right plays. 
What 
impressed 
Harbaugh 

most, though, was how Rudock 
reacted to his pick-six. 

“I’ll say this about Jake — 

you throw an interception for a 
touchdown and then you come 
back and lead a touchdown 

drive, I thought that was 
outstanding,” Harbaugh said. 

Two 
drives 
after 
his 

final 
interception, 
Rudock 

completed six of eight passes 
in orchestrating a nine-play, 
80-yard 
touchdown 
drive. 

Though it was meaningless 
after Michigan’s unsuccessful 
onside kick attempt with 54 
seconds left, it allowed Rudock 
to further his rapport with the 
receivers.

He connected with Perry 

three 
times 

for 41 yards 
on the drive, 
and fed both 
redshirt 
junior 
wide 

receiver 
Amara 
Darboh 
and 

junior 
tight 

end Jake Butt 
their 
eighth 

receptions of 

the game.

After just one summer with 

his new receivers because of his 
transfer, Rudock, for the most 
part, appeared to be in sync 
with Butt and Darboh for most 
of the night. With their eight 
receptions, each accumulated 
more than 90 yards receiving. 
Rudock’s 
mentality, 
despite 

the apparent struggles that 
also included a couple of costly 
overthrows, impressed Butt.

“He’s a fighter,” Butt said.
Rudock, still stone faced 

after he gathered his belongings 
to head to the team bus, looked 
straight ahead and spoke to 
nobody as he left Rice-Eccles 
Stadium. 
Michigan 
football 

recruiting 
coordinator 
Erik 

Campbell watched as he walked 
by and whispered into Rudock’s 
ear.

Then, the quarterback, after 

a debut to forget, disappeared.

The good, the bad and the ugly

Butt catches 

eight passes, but 
Michigan loses 
turnover battle

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

As much as we didn’t know 

about the Michigan football 
team going into the season 
opener Thursday at Utah, most 
of it shook out as expected.

Fifth-year 
senior 
Jake 

Rudock started at quarterback. 
Junior running back De’Veon 
Smith started at running back 
after being listed as No. 1 on the 
depth chart. The defense out-
paced the offense, as it has for 
most of the past two seasons.

In the end, the Wolverines 

squandered some chances in 
losing a back-and-forth game 
in Salt Lake City. Here’s the 
good, the bad and the ugly from 
Thursday’s game:

The good

Junior tight end Jake Butt 

was as good as advertised. 
Before fall camp started, Michi-
gan coach Jim Harbaugh called 
Butt the best pro tight end pros-
pect he’s ever had. Butt was 
the Wolverines’ most viable 
offensive 
weapon, 
catching 

eight passes for 93 yards and 
a touchdown. Michigan badly 
needed the touchdown, too: He 
pulled in a pass over the middle 
through double coverage, cut-
ting the deficit to seven late in 
the third quarter.

Butt’s 
greater 
impact, 

though, was being a consis-
tent target in short-yardage 
situations. Rudock completed 
a four-yard pass to him on 3rd-
and-3 on the Wolverines’ first 
possession, and he relied on 
his tight end often as the game 
went on.

Michigan was also strong 

up front against Utah running 

back Devontae Booker. Booker 
ran for 1,512 yards and 10 touch-
downs last season, though just 
34 of those yards came at Mich-
igan. The Wolverines limited 
him again Thursday, this time 
to 69 yards on 22 carries.

Smith broke a number of 

tackles in limited open space. 
Redshirt freshman Jabrill Pep-
pers took Michigan’s only kick 
return 36 yards.

And on an off-field note, the 

weather was good, the view was 
beautiful and the Michigan fan 
turnout strong.

The bad

The Wolverines could never 

truly bottle up Utah quarter-
back Travis Wilson. The slip-
pery 6-foot-7, 233-pound senior 
was more of a running threat 
than in last year’s matchup, 
when he rushed for just 25 yards 
and missed part of the game 
with an injury.

Thursday, he opened the 

game by running on the first 
three plays for 15 yards. He 

finished with 53 yards on 12 
carries, including a perfectly 
executed fake jet sweep, when 
he went 14 yards untouched into 
the end zone. That put Michi-
gan in the first of two 14-point 
deficits, though the Wolverines 
had their chances.

Though improved, the run-

ning game struggled to gain 
traction. Neither Smith nor 
junior running back Ty Isaac 
averaged more than three yards 
per carry, and the longest run of 
the game was seven yards.

The ugly

Michigan lost the turnover 

battle, failing to improve on one 
of its biggest weaknesses last 
season.

After 
throwing 
just 
five 

interceptions last year, Rudock 
threw three on Thursday. His 
two years of experience gave 
him the edge in the quarterback 
competition, but miscues were 
his downfall.

His first pick, which appeared 

to happen because of a miscom-

munication with freshman wide 
receiver Grant Perry, halted a 
drive just shy of the red zone. 
On his second, he overthrew 
the receiver (also Perry). His 
third was likely just a combi-
nation of Rudock forcing a late 
throw and Utah defensive back 
Justin Thomas making a play on 
yet another attempted pass to 
Perry. Thomas ran it back for a 
touchdown to put the game out 
of reach.

On the other side of the ball, 

Michigan’s defense failed to 
force any turnovers, save for 
redshirt junior Jeremy Clark’s 
interception on a Hail Mary 
at the end of the first half. 
Between one Michigan give-
away in scoring position, anoth-
er returned for a score and none 
on the defensive end, it’s hard 
not to point to turnovers as the 
difference-maker.

The Wolverines have to clean 

that up before Saturday’s home 
opener against Oregon State. 
If they do, they’ll have a good 
chance to pick up the first win 
of the Harbaugh era.

Five Things We Learned: Utah

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Wolverine fans descended 

on Salt Lake City from across 
the country, but there was no 
storybook opening to coach Jim 
Harbaugh’s career at Michigan. 
The Michigan football team fell 
to Utah, 24-17, at Rice-Eccles 
Stadium to open the season.

The Wolverines were slow to 

start, but that was to be expected 
of a team that sputtered to a 5-7 
mark last season. Harbaugh, 
though, stuck up for his players’ 
effort after the game, praising 
them where it was deserved and 
defending them from even their 
own self-criticism.

Here are five things we 

learned 
from 
the 
season-

opening loss.

1. 
 
Jake 
Rudock 
has 

weapons…

Junior tight end Jake Butt 

was already a player to watch 
— he was named to the Mackey 
Award watch list in July — but 
he somehow still outperformed 
expectations 
in 
the 
season 

opener. After catching 21 passes 
in an injury-hampered 2014, 
Butt caught eight for 93 yards 
and a touchdown Thursday. He 

made arguably the play of the 
night for Michigan, grabbing 
a touchdown through double 
coverage.

Redshirt 
junior 
receiver 

Amara Darboh also impressed, 
stepping into his role as the No. 
1 receiver with eight catches 
for 101 yards and a score. Both 
Darboh and Butt were Rudock’s 
primary 
targets 
in 
high-

pressure situations, and for the 
most part, they came through 
for him.

2. …If he can just hit them

Rudock, who was heralded 

as the safe, consistent option at 
quarterback, was anything but 
that against Utah. The fifth-
year senior overthrew redshirt 
junior Jehu Chesson and Darboh 
three times on deep balls, one of 
which would likely have gone 
for a score.

What’s more, Rudock was 

intercepted 
three 
times, 
a 

stunning development for a 
player who threw just five picks 
all of last season. We’ll give him 
a slight pass on the first, which 
looked like a miscommunication 
with freshman receiver Grant 
Perry, but even so, it wasn’t what 
was expected of the graduate 
transfer.

3. The defensive line could 

wreak havoc

Redshirt 
juniors 
Willie 

Henry and Chris Wormley were 
forces on the outside, combining 
for nine tackles, four of them 
for loss. Henry, who moved 
to the strong-side defensive 
end from defensive tackle this 
year, was nearly unblockable at 
his new position, a great sign 
for defensive line coach Greg 
Mattison.

Senior Mario Ojemudia, a 

converted end who plays the 
hybrid 
buck 
position, 
also 

seemed to embrace his new 
position, tallying five tackles 
and a sack.

On the inside, senior Ryan 

Glasgow and redshirt junior 
Matt 
Godin 
weren’t 
game 

breakers, but they may not need 
to be. The Wolverines would 
welcome statistical production 
from them, but with so much 
talent on the edges, it might be 
enough to simply occupy their 
blockers and help collapse the 
pocket.

4. The run blocking needs 

to improve

The 
inside 
of 
the 
line 

just couldn’t seem to create 
openings for Michigan’s backs. 
Harbaugh said senior center 
Graham Glasgow earned the 
highest grade of the offensive 
linemen in Thursday’s game, 
and singled him out as having 
a 
great 
performance, 
but 

Michigan’s 
backs 
couldn’t 

generate 
anything 
up 
the 

middle.

The Wolverines averaged 2.6 

yards per carry in their opener, 
including 
2.8 
from 
junior 

running back De’Veon Smith. 
Those numbers will need to 
improve if they intend to be a 
run-first team.

Smith broke all kinds of 

tackles 
against 
the 
Utes, 

which had to be encouraging 
to Harbaugh and new running 
backs coach Tyrone Wheatley. 
Unfortunately for Smith, many 
of those broken tackles came 
at the line of scrimmage. If 
Michigan 
can 
create 
wider 

holes, and Smith can find and 
hit them, he looks like someone 
who can churn out chunks of 
yards at a time.

5. 
BOLD 
PREDICTION: 

Butt will lead the team in 
catches

While Darboh proved himself 

as a capable No. 1 receiver 
against Utah, Butt’s value as 
a safety valve will pay huge 
dividends for Rudock. His size 
and athleticism pose matchup 
problems for virtually anyone 
who could cover him, as the 
Utes learned Thursday.

After his eight catches in the 

opener, opposing teams will be 
keying on Butt, but that doesn’t 
mean they can stop him. He 
will be an option on nearly 
every pass play, and unless they 
ignore Chesson and Darboh 
outside, he’ll find ways to get 
open.

The Jake-to-Jake connection 

is only just beginning.

‘M’ sweeps with double-OT victory

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

Throughout his tenure as a 

Wolverine, 
senior 
midfielder 

James Murphy has made scoring 
crucial goals for his team some-
thing of a habit. Sunday was no 
exception.

Two minutes into double over-

time, Murphy watched junior 
defender Rylee Woods launch a 
free kick into the penalty box.

“I just sort of ended up in the 

(18-yard) box, and luckily, no one 
seemed to be marking me,” Mur-
phy said. “It was a good ball, and 
I just thought to myself, ‘Attack it, 
go get whatever you can on it.’ ”

Woods had seen that Murphy 

was unguarded on the backside 
and launched a perfectly weight-
ed ball into the box. Murphy leapt 
to meet the ball, heading it past 
the goalkeeper and into the right 
side of the net.

With the goal, the Michigan 

men’s soccer team (2-1) defeated 
Niagara, 2-1, Sunday at U-M Soc-
cer Stadium.

“Luckily, I got pretty good con-

tact on it, and it went in,” Murphy 
said. “It was a bit of a relief, to be 
honest.”

The Wolverines established a 

threatening attack early on, tak-
ing eight shots and nine corner 
kicks in the first half alone. Yet 
despite the relentless attack, find-
ing the back of the net proved to 
be a challenge.

“We created a lot of chances, 

which is always a positive thing 
from an attacking point of view,” 
Murphy said. “Some of those 
didn’t go in, but we had good 
efforts, to be fair. … We kept fight-
ing and kept working hard, and 
we found a way out of it in the 
end, which is pleasing.”

The Purple Eagles (0-4) had 

only scored one goal in three 
games entering Sunday’s match. 
But in the 23rd minute, Niagara 
caught the Wolverines off guard 
on a dangerous counterattack. 
Forward Alex Dimitriu capital-

ized on the opportunity, lobbing a 
shot from 25 yards out that float-
ed over the outstretched arms 
of sophomore goalkeeper Evan 
Louro to give the Purple Eagles 
a 1-0 lead.

“We could have easily been 

(up) 2-0 in the first 10 minutes,” 
Murphy said. “Their score was 
a good goal, to be fair to him. ... 
They obviously got confidence 
off that, sat in and made it really 
difficult for (us), and it is frustrat-
ing.”

In the second half, Michigan 

was more aggressive with its 
attack, tallying nine shots. Fresh-
man defender Marcello Borges 
rattled a free kick off the crossbar 
in the 47th minute, while fresh-
man midfielder Francis Atua-
hene threatened the opposition 
with runs into the 18-yard box.

Daley’s plan of attack paid off 

when freshman midfielder Ivo 
Cerda scored the equalizing goal 

in the 71st minute off a Borges 
assist. Cerda fired a shot at the 
goal line that was originally 
blocked, but he managed to find 
and bury the rebound to tie the 
game.

Late in the match, the Wol-

verines attempted to utilize the 
speed of senior forward Wil-
liam Mellors-Blair by playing 
long balls and letting him outrun 
the defense. Through the end of 
regulation and the first sudden-
death period, Michigan con-
tinued to generate chances, but 
couldn’t find the finishing touch.

It wasn’t until Murphy’s first 

goal of the season that the Wol-
verines sealed the victory.

“It was certainly a hard-

fought, grind-out game which 
I think last year or the last two 
years, we may have given away,” 
Daley said. “Our guys stood up 
and did what they were supposed 
to do.”

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Francis Atuahene set the 

bar high for all forwards on the 
Michigan men’s soccer team 
after scoring a hat trick against 
West Virginia on Friday, putting 
pressure on his teammates to 
match his performance when 
the Wolverines took on Niagara 
on Sunday.

While the freshman forward 

continued to impress, it was 
his fellow wide attackers who 
followed his lead, as Michigan 
(2-1) was able to take down the 
Purple Eagles (0-4) in extra 
time, 2-1.

The Wolverines found success 

on the wings as Niagara failed 
to stop Michigan from moving 
the ball down the flanks the 
entire match. Of the 20 shots the 
Wolverines attempted against 
the Purple Eagles, a majority 

were created thanks to the 
runs and crosses made by wide 
attackers and fullbacks.

Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley started an experienced 
trio of forwards with redshirt 
senior Colin McAtee and senior 
William Mellors-Blair on the 
wing and redshirt senior TJ 
VanSlooten up top. The front 
line controlled possession and 
pushed Niagara back into the 
final third early on, but failed to 
find a finishing touch in front of 
 

the goal.

With the team playing on 

short rest, Daley was forced 
to 
experiment 
with 
his 

wide 
personnel 
and 
turned 

to 
Atuahene 
and 
freshman 

defender Marcello Borges.

“We have some good, dynamic 

players who we can interchange 
in those areas,” Daley said. 
“(Playing one-on-one against 
Atuahene and Borges) can wear 

you down, so I think we have 
good depth in those spots to 
keep the pressure on the other 
team.”

Borges, 
who 
originally 

subbed on as a right back, 
proved impactful early on as he 
made aggressive runs at Purple 
Eagle defenders from his deep 
role. In the second half, he 
was moved forward and was 
successfully getting crosses into 
the box from his more advanced 
position.

“(Borges) is good enough to 

start on the team, easily,” Daley 
said. “We have two fullbacks 
who are physically imposing, 
but Borges is certainly good 
enough to start and will play a 
ton of minutes all season in wide 
areas.”

In the 71st minute, Borges’ 

hard work in the final third paid 
off when he connected with 
fellow freshman forward Ivo 
Cerda for the equalizing goal.

The two fullbacks currently 

starting in front of Borges 
were also key in Michigan’s 
dominance up and down the 
flanks. 
Sophomore 
defender 

Billy Stevens and junior defender 
Rylee Woods gave the forwards 
in front of them several quality 
chances while providing stout 
defense in front of the Wolverine 
net.

Woods 
frequently 
found 

himself making plays further 
up the field in his role as the 
attacking fullback. He was able 
to draw fouls and corners to give 
Michigan chances on set pieces 
that Woods took.

The dead-ball specialist ended 

the prolonged match when he 
found senior midfielder James 
Murphy’s head off a free kick for 
the sudden-death winner.

“It’s great for people like 

me and the other central guys 
because we have so many good 
attacking wide players,” Murphy 
said. “The way they all stepped 
in today when they were asked 
to was real pleasing.”

Pasternak, Wolverines 
start season off strong

Twelve Michigan 
athletes finish in 
top 25 in opener at 
Eastern Michigan

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

It’s not often that starting 

a season ranked No. 12 is seen 
as a disappointment. But for 
the Michigan women’s cross 
country team, which started 
last season as the No. 1 team in 
the nation, it constitutes a dip. 
After an 18th-place finish in 
the NCAA Championships last 
season, the Wolverines enter 
this year with less hype than 
they had last season.

Instead of competing at the 

Michigan Open, the annual 
opening race Michigan has 
hosted for years, the Wolverines 
changed 
up 
their 
schedule 

to 
compete 
at 
the 
EMU 

Celebration. And it has already 
paid off.

“We were all pretty calm 

going into it,” said senior Anna 
Pasternak. “For the most part, 
people were pretty happy with 
how their day went. It was 
definitely the fastest race we’ve 
had as an opener.”

Twelve Michigan athletes 

finished in the top 25, not 
including five others from the 
team who competed unattached. 
One hundred sixteen athletes 
from 
15 
schools 
competed, 

but most of the runners were 
unattached, not representing 
their school.

Michigan junior Erin Finn, 

who ran unattached, finished 
first with a time of 16:54 — a 
course record and the only 
time under 17 minutes in the 
field. Pasternak, the top runner 

among the Wolverines, finished 
fourth overall with a 17:24 clip.

Rounding 
out 
Michigan 

runners in the top 10 were senior 
Shannon Osika, who finished 
sixth with a time of 17:30; senior 
Erika Fluehr, who finished 
seventh with a time of 17:38; 
and redshirt freshman Claire 
Borchers, who finished 10th 
with a time of 17:50. Borchers 
competed just twice last season, 
finishing 13th and 25th at the 
EMU Classic and the Michigan 
Open, respectively. Fluehr is a 
fifth-year senior and graduate 
transfer from Princeton, and 
Saturday was her first time 
competing as a Wolverine.

Each 

Michigan 
athlete’s 
performance 
represented 
improvement, 
as 
all 
seven 

runners 
in 

the Michigan 
Open last year 
ran 
faster 

times in this 
season’s 
opening race. Even with classes 
about to start and the thick 
of the season yet to begin, the 
Wolverines were proud of their 
performances.

“It is definitely a more hectic 

time of the year,” Pasternak 
said. “We just finished our 
preseason camp and people are 
moving into their dorms and 
houses and stuff, and getting 
ready for school. It was nice that 
it was a nearby venue, but we 
were looking forward to seeing 
how our work at camp came 
together at this race.”

At camp, the team split up 

into subgroups and aimed to 
stay in those groups during the 
race. The strategy paid off, as 
some racers ran their fastest 

5Ks 
ever. 
The 
Wolverines 

enjoyed the success that came 
with the plan and hope it will 
continue to improve their times 
as the season progresses.

“(Saturday’s 
race) 
was 
a 

confidence booster,” Pasternak 
said. “Knowing that we can run 
this fast coming off a hard week 
this early, it makes us excited 
for what we can do.”

Pasternak and her teammates 

know that they have a long 
season ahead of them with more 
struggles, because as Michigan 
learned last year, success the 
first week doesn’t mean that 
the outcome in upcoming weeks 
will be certain.

The 

Wolverines 
are especially 
trying to take 
care of their 
bodies 
to 

avoid 
injury. 

Last 
season, 

Finn 
and 

Osika 
were 

injured 
at 

the 
end 
of 

the 
season, 

dashing Michigan’s hopes of a 
national championship.

“We’re really emphasizing 

proper recovery and refueling,” 
Pasternak said. “If we can keep 
that as a priority, that will 
really help us throughout the 
season. We’re going to try to 
use each other as resources for 
knowledge and strength during 
workouts. Each one of us is 
smarter this season compared 
to last year. ”

If the Wolverines stay healthy 

and race as well as they did 
Saturday, the end of the season 
could bode well for Michigan. 
While the EMU Celebration is 
only the first race of the season, 
it’s also the first step toward 
success.

WOMEN’S CROSS COUNTRY

the fastest race 
we’ve had as an 

opener.”

‘M’ splits weekend

By KATIE CONKLIN

Daily Sports Writer

Though 
the 
Michigan 

women’s 
soccer 
team 
went 

1-1 this weekend at the Husky 
Nike Invitational in Seattle, the 
Wolverines’ continued quality 
of play gives them no reason to 
worry early in the season.

Michigan dropped the second 

game of its doubleheader on 
Sunday 
to 
Washington, 
but 

trumping Portland 5-0 earlier 
gave the Wolverines a split.

In its latter match, Michigan’s 

three-game 
winning 
streak 

ended in dramatic fashion when 
Washington scored the winning 
goal in the 89th minute.

“(Sunday’s) game was just what 

we expected,” said Michigan 
coach Greg Ryan. “It was two 
really good teams playing great 
soccer early in the season. It 
just came down to Washington 
scoring a great goal late.”

Entering the contest with a 

4-1 record, the Wolverines had 
outshot their opponents, 112-
27. And against Washington, 
Michigan 
didn’t 
cease 
to 

create opportunities or scoring 
chances. However, outshooting 
Washington 18-12 did not earn 
the Wolverines a win.

“We had plenty of chances 

throughout the match,” Ryan 

said. 
“Perhaps 
the 
better 

chances.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
scoring 

opportunities came from all over 
the roster rather than certain key 
goal scorers. Compared to some 
of Michigan’s opponents, this 
depth is an advantage and could 
be one of the reasons the team is 
seeing such early success.

“We’ve just got a lot of talented 

players 
through 
all 
of 
the 

classes,” Ryan said. “Everybody’s 
contributing. The kids coming off 
the bench are 
contributing, 
and at the end 
of the day, it’s 
early 
in 
the 

season, 
but 

this 
team 
is 

in 
midseason 

form.”

With Michigan’s depth and 

plethora of scoring opportunities, 
all the Wolverines need to do is 
get their shots to land in the back 
of the net, an ability they showed 
against Portland but not against 
Washington.

“We 
scored 
five 
against 

Portland,” Ryan said. “On that 
day we took our chances well, 
but against Washington, we had 
some great chances and we just 
didn’t take them well enough.” 

Against Portland, in their 

first away game of the season, 

the 
Wolverines 
entered 
the 

pitch energized, but with a 
better end result. Sparked by the 
substitution of senior forward 
Lulu Haidar, Michigan began to 
pull away when Haidar bent the 
ball into the upper-right corner 
to make it a 1-0 game in the 26th 
minute.

Michigan’s 
pressure 
up 

top didn’t end there, as the 
Wolverines buried two more 
shots to enter halftime with a 3-0 
lead.

The 

Wolverines 
poured it on 
in the second 
half. Freshman 
forward Reilly 
Martin 
and 

freshman 

midfielder Abby Kastroll notched 
the final two tallies for Michigan, 
resulting in a 5-0 victory.

Michigan plans on putting 

an emphasis on finishing in its 
future matches.

And 
with 
plenty 
scoring 

opportunities created so far this 
season, the Wolverines don’t 
seem worried.

“We have to start hitting the 

net more often — that’s going to 
be our main focus,” Ryan said. 
“Everything else is looking really 
good. We’ve just got to hit the 
net.”

“This team is in 
midseason form.”
