TOLDEO, Ohio - The final
presidential debate on Monday
night marked the beginning of

the home stretch for President
Barack Obama and Republi-
can nominee Mitt Romney's
campaigns for president. And
with less than two weeks until
Election Day, its likely that the
Republican and Democratic tick-
ets will both continue to cam-
paign heavily throughout Ohio,
as Vice President Joe Biden held
a rally here Tuesday on the cam-
pus of the University of Toledo.
There is no question that
Ohio, and Toledo in particular,

could decide the election, and
both campaigns are well aware
of the stakes. Both campaigns,
as well as allied interest groups,
have spent or

Though the
Romney groups
have accumulated an approxi-
mately $100 million advantage
over Obama's groups, Obama

looks to have a slight edge in the
state, with an average lead of 1.9
points, according to Real Clear
Politics.
Obama visited Ohio on Tues-
day, making it his 17th trip to
the state this year. The president
has visited Ohio more than any
other state this election cycle,
and Romney has a number of
planned trips to the state in the
coming two weeks.

Administrators say
the University is
still committed to
increasing diversity
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily Staff Reporter
When senior Levester Wil-
liams came to the University as
a freshman, he said he often felt
disconnected from the campus
community asa black student.
Though Williams overcame
these initial feelings through
active involvement in various
multicultural groups, he said
he still thinks the student body
lacks diversity.
Enrollment figures released
by the Office of the Registrar on
Monday indicate that Africans
Americans represent 4.74 per-

cent of the student body, His-
panics constitute 4.75 percent
and Native Americans comprise
0.19 percent.
In 2011, the total student
body was comprised of approxi-
mately 4.77 percent black stu-
dents and 4.68 percent Hispanic
students, both lower than the
2010 national averages of 14.5
percent and 13 percent respec-
tively,.according to the National
Center for Education Statistics.
Native American students made
up 0.2 percent of the student
body last year.
Of the enrollment figures for
the 2012 freshmen class, 10.2
percent are underrepresented
minorities, a slight decrease
from last year's 10.5 percent.

Annual Wallenberg award
given to environmentalist

Maria Gunnoe
advocates against
coal mining
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporter
Environmental and social
justice advocate Maria Gunnoe
received a standing ovation
from nearly 350 students, fac-
ulty and Ann Arbor residents
as she approached the stage in
Rackham Auditorium to deliv-
er the annual Wallenberg Lec-
ture Tuesday night.
Gunnoe, the 22nd recipient

of the University's Raoul Wal-
lenberg Medal, spoke about
her efforts to eliminate moun-
taintop removal coal mining
and valley fill operations in her
hometown of Boone County,
West Virginia and across the
nation. The University also
. honored her for her focus on
educating others about envi-
ronmental affairs.
Gunnoe began her humani-
tarian work in 2004 after a
flood filled with toxic coal
sludge destroyed her home and
left thousands of others home-
less. With teary eyes, Gun-
noe discussed how the flood
impacted her community and

said she refuses to stop fight-
ing sgainst the coal mining
that has negatively impacted
the health and lives of so many
people.
"We demand an end to the
abuses of the people of Appa-
lachia and our human rights,"
Gunnoe said. "We deserve a
life with healthy land, clean
water, clean air and a clean sus-
tainable energy and future for
our children."
During the event, Univer-
sity Provost Philip Hanlon said

ties and values of Raoul Wal-
lenberg, a 1935 University alum

Jenson allegedly violates

fights second bridge to Windsor

Former UMHS
resident accused
of missing curfew,
using computer
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Former University of Michigan
Health System resident Stephen
Jenson is scheduled to appear in
a review hearing in federal dis-
trict court in Detroit on Wednes-
day for allegedly violating several
stipulations of his bond.

Jenson, who is accused of pos-
sessing child pornography in the
University Hospital, has repeat-
edly violated stipulations of his
bond by breaking curfew and
using a computer that was not
monitored by the court's pretrial
services, according to a document
filed with the court by the pretrial
services on Oct.17.
Jenson, who was released on
bond after being charged by fed-
eral authorities for possession of
child pornography, was originally
only allowed to use a computer
for work-related purposes. How-
ever, his bond conditions were
loosened in June to allow him to

use a court-monitored computer.
Jenson's other conditions -
which include restricted travel
within the jurisdiction of the
federal Eastern District of Mich-
igan and Utah, avoidance of con-
tact with minors or anyone who
could be a potential victim or
witness in the case, attending
sex offender treatment, obeying
a curfew and refraining from
possessing a firearm - continue
to be enforced.
According to court docu-
ments, Jensen has broken curfew
six times in the last six months.

In case Biology 172
wasn't challenging enough
for you freshman year, don't
fret, the Michigan Synthet-
ic Biology Team is here to
help.
The team, which has
competed in the Inter-
national Genetically
Engineered Machines com-
petitions since 2006, works
to create biological systems.
They use biological units
called Biobricks - which
are essentially DNA created
to formulate new biological
systems - according to LSA
senior Josh Atkinson, an
undergraduate member of
the team.

Atkinson said the group
puts DNA into E. Coli cells
to create proteins for vari-
ous purposes. One would be
hard pressed to find a Bio-
brick in any recognizable
technologies, but Atkinson
explained that synthetic
biology is an emerging field,
and the iGEM competition
has only existed since 2004.
The team consists of
about 15 University stu-
dents, primarily from the
College of Engineering and
LSA, but Atkinson said the
group is looking to expand
so it can begin preparing for
competitions year-round.
This year the team com-

peted against more than 40
other Universities in the
iGEM 2012 Americas East
Regional Jamboree - held
in Pennsylvania between
Oct. 12 and Oct. 14 - and
was awarded one of numer-
ous gold medals distributed
at the competition. The
team was also given the
award for the best new Bio-
brick from a natural source.
Next up for the team is a
trip to the World Jamboree
in Boston, one of 14 invitees
from the regional competi-
tion to be granted a spot in
the world competition.

U.N. plans for peacekeepers in Syria'

Russian lawmakers
redefine treason

Forces will only
enter the country
if a ceasefire is
approved
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The United Nations is already
planning for a peacekeeping
force in Syria should a cease-
fire in that country take hold
and pending a Security Council
mandate, the U.N. peacekeeping
chief said Monday.
Herve Ladsous said, however,
it was still too early to say how
many peacekeepers might be
deployed in such an eventual
force.
"I would confirm that, of
course, we are giving a lot of
thought to what would happen
if and when a political solution
or at least a cease-fire would
emerge," Ladsous told reporters
at a U.N. briefing.
U.N. and Arab League envoy
to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi met

with Syrian President Bashar
Assad in Damascus on Sunday
as part of his push for a cease-
fire between rebels and govern-
ment forces for the Eid al-Adha
holiday, which begins Oct. 26.
Syria's state-run news agency
SANA said Damascus supports
the truce proposal, but would
not commit to halting fire dur-
ing a four-day Muslim holiday
until Western countries and
their Gulf allies stop support-
ing rebels and halt their weap-
ons supplies to the anti-regime
fighters.
Brahimi told reporters, fol-
lowing a closed-door meet-
ing, that he also had held talks
earlier with opposition groups
inside and outside the country
and received "promises" but not
a "commitment" from them to
honor the cease-fire.
Brahimi replaced Kofi Annan
as envoy to Syria after the for-
mer U.N. secretary-general
resigned last August, frustrated
by a lack of progress.

Bill says treason
now extends
to financial or
consulvative acts
MOSCOW (AP) - Rus-
sia's lower house of parlia-
ment on Tuesday quickly
rubber stamped a new bill
widely expanding the defini-
tion of high treason. Critics
alleged the legislation is part
of a wider crackdown on dis-
sent by President Vladimir
Putin, who has already pushed
through laws targeting street
protests, aid organizations and
opposition leaders.
Current law describes high
treason as espionage or other
assistance to a foreign state
damaging Russia's external
security. The new bill expands
it to include moves against
Russia's "constitutional order,
sovereignty and territorial and
state integrity."
The bill, drafted by the Fed-
eral Security Service, the main
KGB successor agency, also
changes the interpretation of
treason to include activities
such as financial or consulta-
tive assistance to a foreign state
or an international organiza-
tion.
The bill, which the lower
house, the State Duma, over-
whelmingly approved Tues-
day, is certain to quickly sail
through the equally pliant
upper house before Putin signs
it into law. It keeps the punish-
ment of up to 20 years in prison
used by the current law.
Rights activists have warned
that the new bill is so loosely
worded that it would allow the
government to brand any dis-
senter a traitor.
"It would allow them to
put any civil activist, let alone
rights defender, in custody,"
said Lev Ponomaryov, a veteran
Russian rights activist. "It will
place a sword over the head
of anyone who is maintaining
contacts with foreigners."
The socialist Just Russia

party was the only Duma fac-
tion that didn't vote for the
bill, although it stopped short
of voting against it. Just Rus-
sia leader Sergei Mironov
voiced concern that the bill's
loose wording could allow the
authorities to use it to stifle dis-
sent.
Russia's rights ombudsman,
Vladimir Lukin, also criti-
cized the bill, saying it would
free investigators of the need
to prove that a suspect inflict-
ed any actual damage to the
nation's security.
Putin has clamped down
on the opposition following
a series of major street ral-
lies against his re-election to
a third term as president in
March. The Russian leader has
claimed that the protests were
staged by Washington in order
to weaken Russia, and he filled
his campaign with anti-Ameri-
can rhetoric.
New repressive laws have
been passed to deter people
from joining protests, and
opposition activists have been
subject to searches and inter-
rogations.
One of the laws passed
this summer obliged non-
governmental organizations
that receive foreign funding
and engage in vaguely defined
political activity to register
as "foreign agents," which is
intended to destroy their cred-
ibility among Russians.
Earlier this month, Mos-
cow declared an end to the
U.S. Agency for International
Development's two decades of
work in Russia, saying that the
agency was using its money to
influence elections - a claim
the U.S. denied.
In August, a court handed
down two-year prison sen-
tences to three members of
the punk band Pussy Riot for
performing an anti-Putin song
inside Moscow's main cathe-
dral. One was freed earlier this
month after a court suspended
her sentence, but the other two
were sent from a Moscow jail
to remote prison colonies this
week.

MILFORD, Mich.
At least 2 cougar
sightings reported
in SE Mich.
At least two people have
reported possible cougar sight-
ings near Kensington Metropark
in suburban Detroit.
The Oakland Press of Pon-
tiac reports that experts say it's
unlikely one of the big cats would
be in Michigan's southern Lower
Peninsula.
Michael Pucker, interpretive
' naturalist at the park, says that if
the reports near Milford are cor-
rect the animal might be one that
was kept as a pet and escaped.
Michigan Department of Nat-
ural Resources spokesman Ed
Golder says it would be unusual
to have a cougar in the area. He
says some people see bobcats and
mistake them for cougars. Gold-
er says the DNR looks for tracks,
fur on a fence or other evidence
to help confirm such sightings.
The DNR has verified the
presence of cougars in the Upper
Peninsula.

Apple's iPad Mini
much pricier than

Apple Inc.'s pencil-thin,
smaller iPad will cost much more
than its competitors, signaling
the company isn't going to get
into a mini-tablet price war.
The company debuted the
iPad Mini Tuesday, with a screen
two-thirds smaller than the full
model, and half the weight. Cus-
tomers can begin ordering the
new model on Friday. In a sur-
prise, Apple also revamped its
flagship, full-sized iPad just six
months after the launch of the
latest model.
Apple'slate founder SteveJobs
once ridiculed a small tablet from
a competitor as a "tweener" that
was too big and too small to com-
pete with either smartphones or
tablets. Now Apple's own M ni
enters a growing small-tablet
market dominated by Amazon.

A former CIA officer pleaded
guilty Tuesday to leaking the
identity of one of the agency's
covert operatives to a reporter
and will be sentenced to more
than two years in prison.
As part of a plea deal, prosecu-
tors dropped charges for John
Kiriakou, 48, that had been filed
under the World War I-era Espi-

a count of making false state-

Syria's powerful ally Hez-

circumstances.
Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan

150 researchers
will move into new
space on North
Campus
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
The Veterans Affairs Ann
Arbor Healthcare System
and the University of Michi-
gan Health System, located
adjacent to one another, have
become more than just neigh-
bors.
On Monday, the VA signed
a $866,574 multi-year lease
agreement for 24,600 square
feet in the headquarters of the
Institute for Healthcare Policy
and Innovation at the Univer-
sity's North Campus Research
Complex.
The VA's Center for Clini-
cal Management Research,
which investigates solutions to
various health issues, will join
more than 400 University fac-
ulty and students in the facility,
according to Eve Kerr, director
of the center and professor of
internal medicine at the Uni-
versity Medical School.
Kerr said she believes the
NCRC willbe an attractive area
for collaboration between the
University and the VA health
care system.
"In general, NCRC is rapidly
becoming a hub for interdisci-
plinary research and partner-
ships between the University
and outside entities," Kerr said.
"So, the potential for VA
researchers to work alongside
U-M researchers in the same
building and as part of the
same institute made this pos-
sibility very attractive."
The VA's CCMR will move
150 researchers to the new
building, which will free the
20,000 square feet the CCMR
currently occupies in the VA
Hospital for additional veteran
facilities, Kerr said.
The lease agreement
strengthens ties between the
University and the VA, which
cares for more than 8 million
veterans, according to Kerr.
Most of the researchers in the

CCMR are also VA doctors,
University faculty at the Medi-
cal School, School of Public
Health or School of Nursing
or colleagues at the University
Institute for Healthcare Policy
and Innovation.
The IHPI will not only aid
the health care of veterans, but
the UMHS as well, according
to Kerr.
"While our research focuses
on improving care for veterans,
much of our work is also appli-
cable to health care delivery
at the University of Michigan
Health System and many other
health care systems," Kerr said.
"Having CCMR be a partner of
the newly established Univer-
sity of Michigan Institute for
Healthcare Policy and Innova-
tion brings incredible syner-
gies."
CCMR research studies the
impact of changes to health
care, specifically for veterans.
With the new space, it hopes to
find pragmatic solutions to the
most common and costly clini-
cal management challenges
to improve the health care of
veterans. Some of the most
studied cases include heart
disease, diabetes, mental ill-
ness and post-traumatic stress
disorder.
"CCMR studies ways to
improve the quality, effective-
ness, safety and efficiency of
veterans's healthcare," Kerr
said. "Many of our researchers
study ways to improve perfor-
mance measures and clinical
decision support for conditions
like diabetes, heart disease
and cancer. We have a core
group studying approaches to
improve patient safety for hos-
pitalized patients."
The CCMR also includes
the VA Serious Mental Illness
Treatment, Research, and
Evaluation Center and the Dia-
betes Quality Enhancement
Research Initiative. Programs
run collaboratively by both
entities will also be included in
the move including the Patient
Safety Enhancement Program,
the Center for Bioethics and
Social Sciences in Medicine
and the program on Qual-
ity Improvement for Complex
Chronic Conditions.

Creative solutions for off-campus housing
espite the pressure of midterms weighing on the minds of
students, the word "housing" is what truly strikes fear in
the hearts of many unassuming students. For upperclass-
men, it's that dreaded time of year when Friday afternoons are filled
with begrudged house hunting. For freshmen, this concept may be
unwelcome news. Adding to the hassle, Ann Arbor's housing market
is dominated by a few realty companies, which dictate not only prices,
but also living conditions. In order to improve off-campus housing in
Ann Arbor, it's up to students to create a community where off-campus
properties are peer-reviewed and tenant rights are well-known. The
city of Ann Arbor needs to do more to ensure that landlords have less
opportunity to take advantage of students.

There have been a lot of dis-
tractions during this elec-
tion cycle. But with less
than two weeks
until Election
Day on Nov. 6,
let's take a step
back and think
about what this
race is really
about. I
A lot of people MICHAEL
aren't feeling the SPAETH
effects ofthe eco-
nomic recovery
yet. They're still unemployed and
can't find a job. They're fatigued and
impatient. They want jobs immedi-
ately, and that's completely under-
standable. As a result, they blame
President Barack Obama for their
economic miseries.
It's important to understand that
no matter which economic policies
are implemented, recoveries from
financial crises simply take a long
time - particularly the recovery
from the most severe financial crisis
since the Great Depression. "This
is what normally happens after a
severe financial crisis," Nobel Prize
winning economist Paul Krugman
explained in his latest column in The
New York Times.
On the night of Obama's inaugu-
ration, before he had done anything,
Republicans plotted to obstruct his
agenda, according to Robert Draper,
author of "Do Not Ask What Good
We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives" - and they have done
so relentlessly ever since.
Today, they gleefully castigate
the president for not turning this
economy around. Despite the fact
that financial recoveries take a long
time and Obama's dealt with con-
stant Republican opposition, he has
still managed to create approxi-
mately 3.6-million private-sector
jobs since the start of the recovery in
June 2009, according to PolitiFact.
com, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
fact-checkingunit of The Tampa Bay
Times. We definitely need more jobs
than that, but it's still an impressive
feat, under the circumstances.
Can a conservative economic

approach improve the economy more
than Obama's approach?
Republican presidents have cre-
ated far fewer jobs than Democratic
presidents in recent decades. At the
Democratic National Convention in
September, former President Bill
Clinton said - and FactCheck.org
verified - that since 1961, Repub-
licans have occupied the White
House for 28 years and created
24-million private-sector jobs. In
contrast, Democrats have occupied
the White House for only 24 years
since 1961 but created 42-million
private-sector jobs.
Republicans forcefully advo-
tate for slashing the budget using
austerity policies, but these poli-
cies can devastate fragile, recover-
ing economies. An article in The
Guardian describes how in 1937,
during the recovery after the Great
Depression, President Franklin
Roosevelt also decided to enact
austerity measures. As a result, the
United States was thrown back into
a recession and it took a world war
to enable us to fully recover.
In the past few years, auster-
ity policies have caused or wors-
ened recessions across Europe in
countries including Britain, Spain,
Greece, Italy, Portugal and possibly
Germany in the near future.
"Germany's insistence on cut-
ting public budgets has led Europe
into a recession swamp," Robert
Reich, former secretary of labor,
stated in April.
Republican policies have made the
deficit skyrocket. Today's Republican
Party doesn't mention the fact that
conservative president Ronald Rea-
gan nearly tripled the deficit during
his eight years as president. Repub-
lican presidential nominee Mitt
Romney claims that unlike former
President George W. Bush - who
replaced Bill Clinton's surplus with
large deficits every year since 2002
- he will balance the budget. Yet, as
Ezra Klein wrote in the Washington
Post last week, Bush also "endorsed
amending the Constitution to require
a balanced budget. But, like Romney,
he wasspecific about his tax cuts and
increases in military spending, but

vague about his spending cuts. The
result was much higher deficits."
Why will this time be any different?
If we give
Romney a
chance, who are
we electing?
It's hard to say, because Romney
has repeatedly refused to reveal the
details of his economic plan. David
Leonhardt wrote in The New York
Times in September that Romney
"will not say which tax breaks he
would reduce, andthe large ones,like
the mortgage-interest deduction,
are all popular." Leonhardt cited a
detailed analysis by the Tax Policy
Center that, in his words, "showed
that achieving all of Mr. Romney's
top-line goals - a revenue-neutral
overhaul that does not increase the
tax burden of the middle class - is
not arithmetically possible."
Even if Americans decide to give
Romney a chance, it's difficult to
know which Romney they're elect-
ing, since he has changed his posi-
tions on issues so frequently. But
chances are, to ensure his politi-
cal survival as president, Romney
would have to support conserva-
tive economic policies that satisfy a
Republican base that's influencedby
the uncompromising Tea Party. His-
tory isn't kind to these policies.
The President certainly hasn't
had perfect economic policies.
Some economists like Krugman
believe the 2009 stimulus should
have been bigger. But Obama's plan
for increasing the number of manu-
facturing jobs, investing in clean
energy, focusing on innovation and
investing in education are steps in
the right direction. Let's give the
president enough time to finish the
job he started.

Many searching for off-campus proper-
ties are doing so with little house or apart-
ment hunting experience. Usually, students
hear about living conditions and landlords
from their friends or by word of mouth. This
is only slightly effective - the information
students receive is limited by who they know
and what properties their friends are familiar
with. Most students, therefore, aren't fully
informed about what to expect upon signing
a lease. To counteract this problem and edu-
cate students about landlords and properties,
a universal housing database should be creat-
ed, where current tenants can rate properties
and landlords - the RateMyProfessors.com of
housing.
This won't just give students more infor-
mation to make better decisions, but it will
also keep monopolizing landlords in check.
Bad reviews would deter students from sign-
ing leases at those properties, detracting
poorly rated landlords' business. This will
provide incentive for rental companies and
landlords to better accommodate students's
needs and keep properties desirable and
prices competitive - capitalism that actually
works for students.
Major complaints regarding rental proper-
ties in Ann Arbor include condition and main-

tenance of the properties. Some landlords
ignore maintenance requests and allow prob-
lems to develop until conditions are practi-
cally unlivable. City ordinances state that
rental houses in Ann Arbor must be inspected
every 30 months. This time period allows for
about two 12 month leases to expire before
another inspection. The time allotment needs
to be shortened by the city to ensure safe liv-
ing conditions for students.
When houses are not properly maintained,
students need to be informed about avail-
able legal actions to be levied against their
landlords and realty companies. Lawyers are
available to students in serious incidences that
require court cases filings. Ann Arbor must
also take initiative and help students fight
unfair housing practices. Students, the city
and landlords, with the University's help, must
collaborate to reach an agreement to improve
off-campus housing conditions. The first steps
can include creating a housing review website
to inform potential tenants aboutthe pros and
cons of each property, insisting on more fre-
quent and thorough housing inspections and
pressuring landlords to stop taking advantage.
of students. Plausible solutions exist for the
housing problems in Ann Arbor and must be
implemented immediately.

Presidential elections tend to
draw a higher percentage
of the population to the bal-
lot box, which
makes this an
important year
for other issues
that Michigan
residents will
vote on.
Proposal 3
might be the
most important MARY
of this year's six GALLAGHER
ballot propos-
als. It would
increase the renewable energy
standard in Michigan to 25 per-
cent by 2025. This would raise our
state's current goal of 10 percent
renewable energy by 2015, a stan-
dard approved by the state legisla-
ture in 2008.'
I spent last semester interning
for one of the groups advocating for
this ballot initiative - the Michi-
gan League of Conservation Voters
- so I have a strong bias toward the
approval of Proposal 3. MLCV is an
Ann Arbor-based organization that
describes itself as "the leading non-
partisan political voice for protect-
ing Michigan's land, air, and water,"
and has offered its support for Prop
3 because "in-state renewable ener-
gy production means thousands of
new in-state jobs."
Whenever I bring up Proposal 3
- yeah, I'm a lot of fun at parties -
the most common concern is if the
cost of expanding renewable energy
would go straightto our energy bills.
Fortunately, the proposal specifies
that companies can't increase their
electric utility rate any more than
1 percent per year solely to comply
with the standard. If it's truly impos-
sible to achieve compliance with-
out increasing rates, the proposal

allows for deadline extensions. How-
ever, that shouldn't be too much of a
problem, considering that a total of
20 states have already passed simi-
lar initiatives "without significant
increases in utility costs for consum-
ers," including three other Great
Lakes states - Illinois, Minnesota
and Ohio.
After they find the cost isn't going
toward consumers, people are gen-
erally concerned that the increased
requirement will lead to job cuts
within energy companies. Howev-
er, the proposal mandates that the
legislature "enact additional laws
to encourage the use of Michigan-
made equipment and employment
of Michigan residents," which
would actually lead to the creation
of more jobs in Michigan rather
than relying on outside labor and
resources to supply our energy.
Currently, 60 percent of Michi-
gan's energy is provided by out-of-
state coal supply. Out of the $31.3
billion Michigan spent on energy
in 2009, $22.6 billion was sent to
other states and countries for their
energy resources.
This is an unacceptable waste of
Michigan's incredible manufactur-
ing capacity. The manufacturing
capacity is what built our state in
the first place. That's why Proposal
3 was endorsed by the United Auto
Workers, whose president, Bob
King said, "Proposal 3 will help
put our state's manufacturing tal-
ent to work, will help to preserve
a healthy environment for Michi-
gan citizens while reining in rising
energy costs for businesses."
Many people perceive renewable
energy as a highly partisan concept,
a pet project of the hippie tree-hug-
gers on the left. However, even con-
servative business leaders like Steve
Linder, president of the Republican

consulting firm Sterling Corpora-
tion, support the initiative. As Linder
pointed out in a May 2012 inter-
view, "While we don't like govern-
ment mandates, this allows us to use
manufacturing capacity in Michigan
rather than bringing in $1.6 billion
worth of coal from West Virginiaand
Pennsylvania."

Renewable
energy is wrongly
perceived as
partisan.
Since the bill was passed in 2008
to mandate 10 percent renewable
energy by 2015 in the state legisla-
ture, there has been some confu-
sion. Why is this new initiative, so
similar to the last one, being voted
on by the general population rath-
er than by state representatives?
This is because the political envi-
ronment in Lansing has changed
drastically since that time. In the
past few years, the legislature has
become increasingly partisan,
making it harder and harder to get
any bill passed, no matter how ben-
eficial it is to Michigan's economy,
environment or public health.
That's why we're lucky that the
reform is being brought up as a bal-
lot proposal. Instead of relying on
our legislators to listen to their con-
stituents and come together to serve
the commongood,we're ableto show
up at the voting booth and make that
change happen for ourselves.

Superhero movies are usu-
ally a fail-safe Hollywood for-
mula: Money for the studios
and a big break for the leading
men in tights (and metal suits
and ripped shorts and Kevlar ...
oh, you get it). But the genre has
always spelled uncertainty for
their most peripheral charac-
ters - the women. After years
as marginalized plot devices,
the women of the superhero uni-
verse have evolved into protago-
nists as impressive as the heroes
themselves.
A prime exception to sole-
ly supporting women is the
"X-Men" series, which from
comic book page to screen intro-
duced a host of powerful women
in almost equal number to the
men. From vengeful combatant
Mystique to the shy-but-deadly
Rogue, the story has always been
about humans and mutants, triv-
ializing further classification.
Even Jean Grey (Famke Jans-
sen), the obligatory center of a
love triangle, is a teacher, scien-
tist and one of the most powerful
and volatile mutants alive.
Nothing showcases the evo-
lution of females in superhero
movies more than this summer's
fare. Black Widow (Scarlett
Johannson) of "The Avengers"
more than holds her own among
six male colleagues and the
nefarious villan Loki. The most
brilliant accomplishment here
is that it isn't even discussed.
Her gender isn't pointed out
once in the movie; the writing
and performances are so natu-
ral that reviewers barely even
commented on it. She never uses
her sexuality as a weapon, and
only mentions romance when
remarking that "love is for chil-
dren." It didn't escape my notice
that she wears a rather skintight
combat suit - but if anything
was objectified in that movie,
it was Chris Evans's back in a
t-shirt.

Nuanced characters
perfectly embody
teenage dysfunction
ByKAYLA UPADYAYA
Senior Arts Editor
"The Perks of Being a Wall-
flower" is not a perfect movie. The
film adaptation of the 1999 young-
adult novel of
the same name *
starts off a bit
choppy, and The Perks
the pacing
remains erratic of Being a
to the end. But Wallflower
its flaws are
oddly fitting, At Quality 16
because "Perks" and Rave,
never tries to
give a gloss to Summit
its portrayal
of growing up. It's a story about
dysfunction and introversion, its
narrative unfolded by a tortured,
unstable protagonist. So, its messi-
ness is appropriate, even beautiful.
Charlie (Logan Lerman, "The
Three Musketeers") just started
high school, and he's already
counting down the days until
graduation. His best friend, Mike,
shot himself last May - a reveal
so matter-of-fact and hushed that
it'd be easy to miss completely.
But Charlie meets Sam (Emma
Watson, "Harry Potter and the

Deathly Hallows: Part 2") and
Patrick (Ezra Miller, "We Need to
Talk About Kevin"), two eccentric
step-siblings who welcome him
into their island of misfit toys.
As the director, screenwriter
and producer (not to mention
the author of the original novel),
Steven Chbosky ("Rent") knows
this story inside and out, and the
celebrated care he pours into the
camerawork - like the effortless
blend of Charlie's memories with
the present - makes for a capti-
vating display.
Some of the more peculiar
direction choices are mesmeriz-
ing. At a post-homecoming party,
Sam tells Patrick about how Char-
lie lost his best friend. She does
so in a whisper, but not the kind
of stage whisper you usually see
in the movies. You have to strain
to hear - she breathes the words,
her body angled away from the
camera.
With an impressively penetrat-
ing voice and style for someone
so new to filmmaking, Chbosky
transforms the rigid epistolary
structure of the novel into a story
that dances. The tempo might be
wobbly, but the script is immacu-
late, untangling and probing very
dark, very complicated issues
in a way that's as genuine as it is
elegant.
Also relatively inexperienced
are the film's trifecta of young
stars. While Watson is hardly a

newcomer, she does an about-face
from the character she played for
a decade. Sam, an uninhibited and
passionate girl trying to shed her
turbulent past before college, is
no Hermione, and Watson brings
a magnetic honesty to her perfor-
mance, never allowing Sam to slip
into a bad-girl cliche.
Miller similarly sheds the skin
of his haunting performance
as the titular teen sociopath of
"We Need to Talk About Kevin."
Patrick is the beating heart of
"Perks." On the surface, he's the
class clown, the guy who orga-
nizes the senior prank and does
impressions of teachers. But like
Charlie and Sam, he too harbors
intense pain - he's involved with
a closeted football star whose
father would kill him if he ever
came out. And Miller is wholly
mindful of all of Patrick's intrica-
cies in his approach, dominating
some scenes with his infectious
comedy and others with a quiet
anguish.
But the film's most indelible
images come from Lerman, who
has the staggeringtask of captur-
ing Charlie's internal struggles
without dipping too far into the
macabre. We have to believe just
how tormented Charlie is for the
character to work, and Lerman
manages to make that happen
without taking the character to a
point beyond empathy. The story
is told from deep within Charlie's
head, which would feel suffocat-
ing if not for the delicacy of Ler-
man's touch.
The script zooms in on the
specificity of these characters'
anxieties, with enough close-ups
to enliven and augment even the
minor characters. But "Perks"
also doesn't belong to a certain
time or place, painting broad
strokes with its more peripheral
details.
This is a world in which you
pour out your feelings in a mix-
tape and who you sit with at lunch
can seem like the most important
thing in the world. And no matter
how distantof a memory teenage-
dom is for viewers, "Perks" will
resonate.

HEROINES
From Page 5A
proves she is anything but.
Without completely spoiling
the movie, suffice it to say that
appearances can't be trusted,
and that the gravest mistake any
character makes in "The Dark
Knight Rises" is underestimat-
ing a woman. Christopher Nolan
may be disconcertingly unaware
of the existence of women, but
the few he allows into his hal-
lowed interpretation of Gotham
City aren't afraid to fight for
their radical beliefs.
Women have always been
present in superhero movies, but
contributing minimally to plot
and character development. In
the modern movie climate, these
blockbusters are indispensable,
but the old female formula is
beyond archaic. The women who
were once just barely visible are
makingtheir presence known.
Personally, I'll know female
representation in superhero
movies is incontrovertibly
changed for the better when I
see a young girl dressed as Black
Widow among all the boys who
spend Halloween as Iron Man
and Captain America. We may
finally live in a society where
being Catwoman is as enticing
as being a princess - and that's
about as super as it gets.

NYPD i nformant forced
to 'bait' Muslim terrorists

19 year old asked
to partake in
'create and capture'
program
NEW YORK (AP) - A paid
informant for the New York
Police Department's intelli-
gence unit was under orders
to "bait" Muslims into saying
inflammatory things as he lived
a double life, snapping pictures
inside mosques and collecting
the names of innocent people
attending study groups on Islam,
he told The Associated Press.
Shamiur Rahman, a 19-year-
old American of Bangladeshi
descent who has now denounced
his work as an informant, said
police told him to embrace a
strategy called "create and cap-
ture." He said it involved creat-
ing a conversation about jihad
or terrorism, then capturing the
response to send to the NYPD.
For his work, he earned as much
as $1,000 a month and goodwill
from the police after a string of
minor marijuana arrests.
"We need you to pretend to be
one of them," Rahman recalled
the police tellinghim. "It's street
theater."
Rahman said he now believes
his work as an informant against
Muslims in New York was "det-
rimental to the Constitution."
After he disclosed to friends
details about his work for the
police - and after he told the
police that he had been con-
tacted by the AP - he stopped
receiving text messages from his
NYPD handler, "Steve," and his
handler's NYPD phone number
was disconnected.
Rahman's account shows how
the NYPD unleashed informants
on Muslim neighborhoods, often
without specific targets or crim-
inal leads. Much of what Rah-

man said represents a tactic the
NYPD has denied using.
The AP corroborated Rah-
man's account through arrest
records and weeks of text mes-
sages between Rahman and
his police handler. The AP also
reviewed the photos Rahman
sent to police. Friends confirmed
Rahman was at certain events
when he said he was there, and
former NYPD officials, while
not personally familiar with
Rahman, said the tactics he
described were used by infor-
mants.
Informants like Rahman
are a central component of the
NYPD's wide-ranging programs
to monitor life in Muslim neigh-
borhoods since the 2001 terror-
ist attacks. Police officers have
eavesdropped inside Muslim
businesses, trained video cam-
eras on mosques and collected
license plates of worshippers.
Informants who trawl the
mosques - known informally
as "mosque crawlers" - tell
police what the imam says at
sermons and provide police lists
of attendees, even when there's
no evidence they committed a
crime.
The programs were built with
unprecedented help from the
CIA.
Police recruited Rah-
man in late January, after his
third arrest on misdemeanor
drug charges, which Rahman
believed would lead to serious
legal consequences. An NYPD
plainclothes officer approached
him in a Queens jail and asked
whether he wanted to turn his
life around.
The next month, Rahman
said, he was on the NYPD's pay-
roll.
NYPD spokesman Paul
Browne did not immediately
return a message seeking com-
ment about Tuesday. He has
denied widespread NYPD spy-

ing, saying police only follow
leads.
In an Oct. 15 interview with
the AP, however, Rahman said
he received little training and
spied on "everything and any-
one." He took pictures inside the
many mosques he visited and
eavesdropped on imams. By his
own measure, he said he was
very good at his job and his han-
dler never once told him he was
collecting too much, no matter
whom he was spying on.
Rahman said he thought he
was doing important work pro-
tecting New York City and con-
sidered himself a hero.
One of his earliest assign-
ments was to spy on a lecture
at the Muslim Student Asso-
ciation at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice in Manhat-
tan. The speaker was Ali Abdul
Karim, the head of security at
the Masjid At-Taqwa mosque in
Brooklyn. The NYPD had been
concerned about Karim for years
and already had infiltrated the
mosque, according to NYPD
documents obtained by the AP.
Rahman also was instructed
to monitor the student group
itself, though he wasn't told to
target anyone specifically. His
NYPD handler, Steve, told him
to take pictures of people at the
events, determine who belonged
to the student association and
identify its leadership.
On Feb. 23, Rahman attended
the event with Karim and lis-
tened, ready to catch what he
called a "speaker's gaffe." The
NYPD was interested in buzz
words such as "jihad" and "revo-
lution," he said. Any radical rhet-
oric, the NYPD told him, needed
to be reported.
John Jay president Jeremy
Travis said Tuesday that police
had not told the school about
the surveillance. He did not say
whether he believed the tactic
was appropriate.

mount issue in the state, and has
remained a theme in campaign
appearances by all candidates.
In his speech, Biden delineat-
ed the clear vision of the Obama
administration for alleviating
social issues and aiding the mid-
dle class before a crowd of about
1,500 attendees.
Biden talked about job out-
sourcing, and distinguished
between the two presidential
candidates on the issue, noting
that while Romney emphasizes a
difference between "off-shoring"
and "outsourcing," he and Obama
seeboth as takingjobs away from
Americans.
"The president's job is to bring
jobs home; the president's job is to
create jobs here," Biden said.
He emphasized the need for
Americans to stand for what they
believe in and vote in a way that
reflects what they want, adding
that there should be a heavier
focus on the middle class and a
concerted effort to continue cre-
ating jobs.
Biden said Romney and Ryan
have not publicly addressed their
thoughts on how to ensure eco-
nomic success for the middle
class well enough.
"Instead of signing a pledge ...

promising that they'll cut taxes
for the very wealthy, they should
be signing a pledge to you, the
middle class, saying that they'll
level the playing field," he said.
"That's the pledge we wrote -
that's why we're running."
He noted that he and Obama
have already started develop a
plan to create new manufactur-
ing jobs and double the country's
exports.
"We're going to give tax breaks
to companies who stay here and
come here - not those who go
abroad," Biden said. "We're going
to develop home-grown energy."
If re-elected, he explained
that he and Obama foresee an
increase in coal, oil and natural
gas generated domestically, as
well as solar power energy and
biofuel. Noting that the admin-
istration plans to create 600,000
jobs solely in natural gas produc-
tion.
Guyton Mathews, a Univer-
sity of Toledo junior studying
political science and communi-
cations, was chosen to address
the audience before Biden took
the stage. In an interview after
the event, he said he was glad
to see that the vice president
addressed some of his primary
concerns - affordable education
and women's rights.
Mathews added that with the
help of supporters like Biden,

the Obama administration can
secure Ohio's support.
"If they just keep at it the way
they're doing it now, (Obama
will) definitely getOhio,"he said.
Mathews was one of many
Ohioans to take advantage of
early voting, which began in late
September.
"It's alot more convenient,"he
said. "We have classes so some-
times it's not as easy to get out to
the polls."
Deonte Howard, a University
of Toledo junior studying social
work, also voted early. Howard
explained that because he has
cerebral palsy, it is hard for him
to stand in line or walk long dis-
tances.
"Early voting gives me the
opportunity to (vote) at a slower
pace so I won't be tired on Elec-
tion Day," he said.
Howard added he thinks
Biden's speech "hit home" for the
college students in attendance.
"I feel like Biden coming down
... is showing that they do care
about us," Howard said. "We are
willing to put in our vote and
I appreciate the fact that they
acknowledge that."

any bridge built thereafter,"
Snyder said in a statement.
A second bridge has been in
development for years, starting
in 2005 while former Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm
was still in office. The Michi-
gan Department of Transporta-
tion reported then that another
bridge was necessary to relieve
traffic congestion at the cross-
ing.
Granholm was not success-
ful in building the bridge due to
Moroun's continued influence
on legislators.
When Synder took office after
Granholm, he indicated the con-
struction of a second bridge was
one of his top priorities as gov-
ernor.
Despite the Legislature's con-
tinued disapproval of bills for
the new bridge, Snyder signed
an agreement with the Cana-
dian Government in June for
the bridge's construction where
Canada agreed to pay for the
construction.
Before Snyder made the
agreement, the Legislature
passed a supplemental budget
which indicated no tax dol-
lars could be spent on a bridge
between Canada and Michigan.
The 82-year-old Ambassa-
dor bridge is one of the busiest
international border crossings
in North America and about
10,000 vehicles cross it each
day. Advocates of the second
crossing say the region will lose
shipping traffic to other border
crossings if another bridge isn't
built.
"The new bridge will be a
great benefit for our state, and
we shouldn't let one billionaire
and his special interest monopo-
ly get in the way," Snyder said in
the release.
Business Economics Prof.
Thomas Lyon said in an Oct.
17 panel discussion at the Ford

School of Public Policy that the
new bridge construction would
make funds available for other
resources in the state.
"(The bridge) would actually
generate $2.2 billion in addition-
al federal highway money that
will be freed up and be given to
the state of Michigan as a gift if
we have the bridge," Lyon said.
Lyon said the only obstacle
to the endowment is Moroun
and his interest in maintain-
ing ownership of international
crossings.
"Well there's one guy that
doesn't like (the deal) ... it's the
monopolist trying to block free
money coming into the state, so
the message is to vote no on Pro-
posal 6," Lyon said. "This one
should be a no brainer."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said The People Should
Decide committee, which is
behind the proposal, has been
campaigning for the proposal.
"There's a very heavy ad cam-
paign behind (Proposal 6), and
the message of that ad campaign
is somewhat compelling," Irwin
said. "People generally have that
initial reaction of having a vote
by the people on these kinds of
things, what could be wrong with
that?"
The commercials, which have
been making claims that the
state will be losing state-funded
programs due to the cost of the
bridge, have cost an estimated
$10 million, which has been fund-
ed by Moroun. Snyder has refuted
the claims the ads are making
because the bridge is to be funded
entirely by the Canadian govern-
ment.
Irwin said the United Auto
Workers support the construc-
tion of a second bridge because
of the opportunities it would
provide for shipping and trans-
portation, and having a vote on
such construction could slow
down or halt the progress.
"We've heard repeatedly in
the Legislature from the auto
companies and from the UAW

that building this new span ...
would be a real benefit to the
auto industry," Irwin said. "It
would be more of an impetus
for (the auto industry) to invest
more here in Michigan."
Representative Mark Oui-
met (R-Scio Twp.) said other
states have implemented policy
similar to Proposal 6 and it has
proven to be inflexible.
"California operates a ballot
initiative, and it ties the hand
of legislative process to work
through (crossing construc-
tion), regardless if they are
Republican or Democrat," Oui-
met said.
Ouimet added that such mea-
sures should not be included
in statewide, permanent law
and could have negative future
implications.
"I just don't think it's good
that (Proposal 6) be in our Con-
stitution," Ouimet said. "I think
that that could be very danger-
ous."
LSA senior Lauren Coffman,
the communications director
for the University's chapter of
the College Democrats, wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
organization has no official
stance on Proposal 6.
LSA senior Nicole Miller,
member of the University's
chapter of the College Republi-
cans, said the unclear phrasing
of the proposal makes it difficult
to support.
"The wording is a little bit
vague and so it could threaten
the construction of other bridg-
es and other projects in the
state," Miller said. "I just think
that the need for a new bridge
in addition to the Ambassador
Bridge is great enough that hav-
ing the proposal passed would
be detrimental."
She added that Proposal 6 is
less partisan and less relatable
to students than many other
measures on the ballot.

Multicultural Initiatives, said
minority enrollment numbers
have decreased as a result of
Proposal 2, the 2006 state refer-
endum that banned affirmative
action policies, which prevented
public institutions from using
race or ethnicity as a deciding
factor in admissions decisions.
According to Nina Grant, the
director of the Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs, under-
represented minorities have
consistently comprised about 10
percent of incoming freshman
classes in recent years. Grant
added that while she always
hopes to see an increase in
minority enrollment at the Uni-
versity, the numbers nationwide
are not where they ought to be
either.
Underrepresented minority
groups include African-Ameri-
can, Hispanic and Native Ameri-
can students. Lester Monts, the
senior vice provost for academic
affairs, said most Asian ethnici-
ties are not considered under-
represented at the University or
in Michigan because they have
such a prominent presence in the
state.
Monts said the number of
underrepresented minorities
might also be lower at the Uni-
versity due to the relatively
homogenous population of the
state, adding that comparing the
University's numbers with col-
leges in other states is mislead-
ing.
"California's population, is
much, much larger than Michi-
gan's, and because of immigra-
tion, its proximity to Mexico and
being on the West Coast ... there
are more people from diverse,
racial and ethnic backgrounds,"
Monts said. "So it's ill-advised,
to make that kind of comparison
based on the number or percent-
age of students."

Michigan State University's
demographic make-up is simi-
lar to the University's - black
students represent about 6.2
percent of the student body and
Hispanics consist of 3.4 percent.
Eastern Michigan University,
however, boasts an underrepre-
sented minority population of 24
percent among undergraduates.
University officials assert-
ed that statistics often do not
accurately reflect the general
attitudes and commitment to
diversity on campus. Matlock
said he believes that diversity
is one of the University's most
defining attributes.
"I think some schools get into
the numbers game ... to me diver-
sity is not only who and how many
people you bring in, but how many
people you get out and what kind
of climate they have that's condu-
cive to it," Matlock said.
Matlock pointed to the large
populations of out-of-state, eth-
nic minority, lower income and
international students as proof
of the University's commitment
to expanding diversity. He noted
that while the gender imbalance
is no longer a primary concern,
only 25 years ago women were not
as equally represented at the Uni-
versity as they are today. Students
in this year's freshman class rep-
resent 46 states and 60 countries.
Monts concurred, stressing
that the impressive number of
international students alone has
created tremendous cultural
diversity and representation.
"We can't really dwell on any
one aspect of diversity," Monts
said. "We really do have to move
beyond just race and ethnicity
because there are other kinds of
diversity that make this Univer-
sity strong."
Matlock said he is impressed
with University efforts focused
on increasing accessibility to
higher education for financially
disadvantaged students.
"I think we've done a much
better job in terms of recogniz-

ing social-economic diversity
(and) trying to put in scholarship
programs and funding programs
to deal with first generation stu-
dents," Matlock said. "We ask for
that information in the admis-
sions application, looking at
social-economics."
Williams, however, said he
feels there is a disparity between
the University's statements
regarding overall diversity and
the reality on campus.
"I don't think it's diverse in a
way that the University conveys
it as," Williams said. "It seems
like they're more committed to
sustainability than diversity."
Despite this inconsistency,
Williams said the wide array of
multicultural support systems
has helped address the lack of
representation for many groups.
Williams has mentored black
freshmen, promoted diversity
issues and is now a student man-
ager at the Trotter Multicultural
Center, which provides a venue
for groups to meet and socialize.
Support for Incoming Black
Students is a mentorship pro-
gram through which African-
American freshmen are paired
with African-American upper-
classmen that connect incoming
students with academic resourc-
es and social opportunities dur-
ing weekly meetings.
Latino freshmen also have
access to an expansive sup-
port system through Assisting
Latinos to Maximize Achieve-
ment. Like SIBS, the program
offers mentorship opportunities,
recruitment efforts and attempts
to generate understanding and
enthusiasm about Latino issues
on campus.
These various multicultural
groups, in combination with
Trotter, are organized and run
by MESA. While these groups
have an extensive presence on
campus, Williams said he hopes
to see more University funding
for and attention paid to multi-
cultural groups in the future.

Gunnoe said Wallenberg
inspired her to make a differ-

"I am humbled to be in the

Gunnoe's activism is inspiring.

Goodrich said.
Goodrich said Students for
Clean Energy hopes to orga-

investment in cleaner energy,
adding that Gunnoe serves as a

The curious case of Denard

'M' defense refuses

Robinson and the second half to be complacent

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Meet the Denard Robinson
few know and fewer can explain,
the Robinson who only appears
in the second half. This Robinson
isn't a reckless playmaker, he's a
game manager.
This Robinson is more care-
ful. He has zero interceptions in
the second half this season. First-
half Robinson has nine this year.
This Robinson is also less
dynamic. He has zero touch-
downs, rushing or passing, in the
fourth quarter. In the other three
quarters, Robinson has nine.
This Robinson is an enigma.
His teammates, even Robinson
himself, can't explain what has
happened in the second half.
Is it by design or is it a fluke? Is
Robinson smarter or is Michigan
limitinghis opportunities to fail?
Is it something else entirely?
"I really don't know the
answer to that one," Robinson
said. "We know we got to fin-
ish. And that's what Coach Hoke
talks about all the time. Finish-
ing strong and trying to win the
fourth quarter and trying to win
the second half."
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said the decline in Robinson' sec-
ond-half statistics - both good
and bad - can be credited to play
calling.
"How many opportunities
is he going to have?" Hoke said.
"(Offensive coordinator Al Borg-
es) obviously is putting the ball in
other people's hands."
That's a novel concept for
Michigan, which in years past
had relied on the senior quarter-
back to win games late. Yes, the
memory of four interceptions
against Notre Dame still lingers,
and Robinson's fourth-quarter

cues from Robinson. His faith
feeds theirs.
Fifth-year senior safety Jor-
dan Kovacs said he had no expla-
nation for the second-half riddle.
And it is a sort of riddle. Yes,
Robinson has slightly fewer pass-
ing and rushing attempts in the
fourth quarter but not enough
to explain the precipitous drops
in two opposite offensive catego-
ries.
Kovacs said Robinson has
tucked the ball more often late
in games - he is forcing it less.
But still he has scored no touch-
downs. Robinson has passed to
win games. Yet he has no inter-
ceptions.
The statistical quirk could
just be a problem of sample size.
Michigan hasn't been in many
close games. Against Notre
Dame, Robinson still powered
Michigan's failed comeback
attempt, leading the Wolverines
to a late field goal. Against Michi-
gan State, he did the same to col-
lect the win.
"He did play pretty smart,"
Borges said of Robinson's perfor-
mance against Michigan State.
"It kept us in the game, although
it wasn't flashy. That part I liked,
which has shown the last three
weeksparticularly, is his growth.
About being conscious of taking
care of the football, making plays
where there are plays, and not
trying to create something that's
not there. That was good."
No, this Robinson isn't flashy,
but he's safer. He makes fewer
mistakes, but he creates less too.
And weirder, still, this Robin-
son said he hasn't even noticed
the second-half enigma, of the
absence of interceptions and
fourth-quarter touchdowns.
"I did not know that at all,"
Robinson said.

pass attempts are low - his 30
fourth-quarter attempts trail
the nearest per-quarter total by
seven.
Yet that figure is deflated by
situation factors: Michigan has
held big leads against Illinois,
Purdue and Massachusetts, and
the game was out of reach by the
fourth quarter against Alabama.
Robinson has sat out two fourth
quarters entirely, bringing his
average fourth-quarter attempts
closer to the norm. And, remem-
ber, Robinson won the game with
his arm against Michigan State
on Saturday with a completion to
junior receiver Drew Dileo that
enabled the game-winning field
goal.

Against Michigan State, win-
ning the second half meant rip-

For the Michigan men's soc-
cer team, it felt good to be home,
or at least it should have. The
Wolverines (2-2-1 Big Ten, 5-7-1
overall) have grown accustomed
to the rowdy Michigan Ultras,
family support and winning at
the U-M Soccer Complex.
Michigan returned to Ann
Arbor Tuesday to host Bowl-
ing Green
(2-2-1 Mid- BGSU 2
American MICHIGAN 0
Confer-
ence, 5-7-3) after a three-game
road stretch that included a vic-
tory against No. 11 Indiana.
The energy was recognizably
high from both the players and
supporters, as Michigan head
coach Chaka Daley made his
return to the sideline after suf-
fering a knee injury two weeks
ago. Much to his dismay, the
return was nothing like Daley
had hoped for, as the Wolverines
fell to the Falcons 2-0.
"I was excited for the oppor-
tunity tonight because we had a
lot of belief that if we could put
things together right here at
home, we could potentially be
above .500 going into the Big Ten
Tournament," Daley said. "That
would have given us a lot of hope
heading forward."
But the Wolverines' early
excitement was not as appar-
ent on the field in the first half.
Though Michigan controlled
much of the possession, it failed
to record a shot on goal in the
initial frame for the first time all
season.
Despite clear offensive woes,
the Wolverines' evident control
of the midfield and a couple of
key stops by redshirt sophomore
goalkeeper Adam Grinwis kept
the score at 0-0 as a dull first half
came to a close.

"I thought we did not control
the final third (of the field),"
Daley said. "I told them (at half-
time) we needed to probe a little
bit more and attack more. We
had the ball a lot, but we were
never really dangerous."
-Michigan must not have been
too intent on Daley's lecture,
though. Bowling Green came out
firing as it maintained persistent
pressure on the the Wolverines'
outside defenders. In both the
47th and 50th minute, Bowling
Green headed beautiful crosses
past Grinwis to put them up 2-0
for good.
"For five to 10 minutes, we
kind of had a half-hearted per-
formance and they got two
goals," Daley said. "They scored
on their chances and we didn't.
That's soccer sometimes."
Much like Michigan did in the
first half, Bowling Green won the
battle in the midfield early on in
the second. The difference was
simply converted opportuni-
ties. The Wolverines managed a
few late chances in the final 15
minutes that included a missed
penalty kick, but the Falcons
remained too much for the typi-
cally defensive-minded Michi-
gan squad.
The Wolverines will stay at
home for the rest of the month,
which will include their final
three regular-season matches
before the Big Ten Tournament.
Michigan will look to get back on
its feet before then, and there's
no better place to do so than
inside the U-M Soccer Complex.
"Playing at home is fantastic,"
Daley said. "I don't think we've
always taken advantage of the
support we have here though.
Our support with the Ultras is
superb, and they show up rain
or shine. They are a fantastic
organization, and when they're
in full force they act as our 12th
man."

Sophomore forward Alex Guptill was Michigan's leading scorer last fall. He's expected to bea big contributer for the Wolverines again this fall.
Offense has blue-collar focus

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer.,a
Out of all the numbers to
show up on the Michigan hockey
team's box score following its
6-3 win over Bentley last Friday
night, the largest one is perhaps
the least impressive for coach
Red Berenson.
Falcon netminder Branden
Komm faced 56 Wolverine shots
over the course of the game, and
let in six goals. And according
to Berenson, the team's problem
lies in the math of it all.
The majority of Michigan's
shots last weekend came in a
flurry in the third period as it
looked to solidify its lead over
the Falcons. Though it did pay
off for the Wolverines - Michi-
gan scored half of its goals in that
final frame - Berenson doesn't
think the shot chart effectively
reflects the team's effort.
"Part of our game is getting
shots through," Berenson said.
"If you look at our shot chart,

you'll see half our shots never
get to the net. Why is that?
They're either blocked or they
miss the net. It's hard to get shots
through."
Aside from puck luck decid-
ing which shots make it past the
goalie, the most important part
of turning shots into goals comes
less from play on the perimeter
and more con-
centrated activ-
ity around the "IT d on
crease. I uolT
Berenson

preaching a p
blue-collar pretty
work ethic to
his players. Its
tenants are sim-
ple - get the puck to the net any-
way you can. It doesn't have to be
fancy, and it certainly shouldn't
try to be "too cute."
Berenson starts drumming
that message in as early as possi-
ble, and it's likely the Wolverines
will get that message every day

of practice for the
son. For as much
team hears, it's sti

letter from the editors
by dylan cinti and jennifer xu
If your parents have enough disposable income to put you up in a pal-
ace like Zaragon or Landmark, then this issue of The Statement prob-
ably isn't for you. But for the rest ofus - the oneswithout the high-rises
and penthouse apartments - we must learn to discerningly navigate
the world of off-campus real estate.
To begin that navigation, there's a couple things to consider. That's
where this issue comes in handy.
First of all, give that lease you're considering signing a good, thorough
read. Payspecial attention to extraneous fees. Is there a clause for a "non-
refundable $1,000 move-in fee"? If so, time to start looking elsewhere.
Now, who are the people you're thinking of signing with? Can you
imagine using the same bathroom as them? Do you envision them
doing the dishes more than just once per semester? If you assumed no
on either account, don't sign on the dotted line.
And what if you think that houses or apartments just aren't right for
you? What if you're looking for something a little more community-
based, with cheaper rent and a self-governing system? Finding the right
fit is equally important as fees or roommates.
These are some questions to ask yourself. There are more.
Needless to say, housing is pretty complex stuff. But when every-
thing falls into place, it can be fantastic. That's the experience we want
you to have - the one where you walk into your house and enjoy it,
unencumbered by rusty pipes, dirty dishes and dirtier slumlords.
And so we present our Housing Issue. It's got a little something for
everyone. Live alone? Read Jesse Klein's article about how despite liv-
ing alone, you are not alone. Trying to get off North Campus and into a
more centrally located residence hall? Read Leah Shepherd's firsthand
account of how that can actually happen. And finally, everyone should
turn to our center spread to learn about what you'll pay on a neighbor-
hood-to-neighborhood basis.
