LSA junior Anna Tushman 

took an AP economics in high 
school and loved it. She came 
to the University of Michigan 
expecting to major in math but 
decided to take Econ 101 and 
found herself fascinated by its 
rational, logical thought process. 
Her 101 class had a fair mixture 
of women and men, but as she 
progressed through the major, 
she found the number of female 
students in her classes leveling 
off. Out of boredom one day in her 
econometrics discussion section, 
she counted the students in the 
class and saw there were four 
male students to every one female.

This drop off holds true when 

considering the numbers. More 
than half of the student body 
of LSA consists of women. Yet, 
according to data kept by the LSA 
Economics Department, women 
are 39 percent of the students 
taking introductory economics 
courses. Women then account for 
about a third of the Econ major.

The disparity isn’t unique to 

the University — the Committee 
on the Status of Women in 
the 
Economics 
Profession 

in 
the 
American 
Economics 

Association did a study surveying 
126 
economic 
departments 

nationwide, finding while women 
make up 33 percent of first-year 
students, they make up only 13 
percent of full, tenured professors 
as of 2016.

While STEM fields also have 

trouble attracting women to their 
classes, intro level courses in the 
Physics Department have a higher 
representation of women than 
in the Economics Department, 
according to Betsey Stevenson, 
associate 
public 
policy 
and 

economics professor.

“It is sort of striking that 

physics is doing a better job of 
getting women into introductory 
physics than economics is in 
introductory 
economics 
at 

Michigan,” Stevenson said. “There 
are questions to be asked of why is 

it that the University of Michigan 
has such a low gender share. But 
they’re not easy answers.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Madeleine 

Danes said a key reason many 
of her female friends stopped 
taking economic classes after the 
intro course was because of lower 
grades.

“Some 
of 
them 
dropped 

because they didn’t do well,” 
Danes said. “If you don’t do well 
in those introductory classes, you 
might be discouraged.”

Tushman 
echoed 
this 

sentiment, 
saying 
when 
she 

does poorly on a test, she feels 
discouraged and less confident 
in her abilities, especially when 
she reads about the difficulties 
women face in the economic field. 
She doesn’t think men absorb 
their failures in the same kind of 
way.

“Women tend to internalize 

things more,” Tushman said. “I 
don’t want to make that a sweeping 
generalization, but I know I do it. 
It’s easy to get discouraged when 
In its second meeting of the 

semester, the University Council 
assembled 
Monday 
night 
to 

discuss student break reform, an 
anti-Semitism training and the Big 
Ten Voting Challenge.

Public Policy senior Ben Keller, 

senior policy advisor to LSA senior 
Anushka Sarkar, the University 
of Michigan’s Central Student 
Government 
president, 
began 

the meeting with presenting a 
reform for the way that exams are 
administered at the University, 
with the implementation of a 
“reading day” policy. This action 
would prevent professors from 
scheduling exams on the day 
immediately 
preceding 
and 

following a scheduled break.

According to Keller, the reading 

day policy would primarily benefit 
the mental health of students so 
they would not have to dedicate a 
substantial amount of time over 
shorter breaks studying for exams. 
Additionally, this is often stressful 
for out-of-state students who often 
need to travel home and suffer 
from further shortened time off 
from classes.

“The Faculty stand with our

the statement reads. “Acts that

The City of Ann Arbor’s 

Solid Waste Fund reportedly 
decreased this year due to 
other 
Post 
Employment 

Benefits and the shutdown 
of 
the 
Materials 
Recovery 

Facility, 
which 
resulted 
in 

higher recycling costs. Yet, 
despite largely distorted fund 
statuses during a meeting with 
City Councilmembers and the 
Environmental 
Commission, 

the City reports the fund is 
currently at a healthy balance.

The 
Solid 
Waste 
Plan 

manages a system for recycling 
collection, which is financially 
supported by the Solid Waste 
Fund, 
an 
enterprise 
fund 

operating in a business format. 
According to Councilmember 
Chip Smith, D-Ward 5, the 2013 
to 2017 Solid Waste Resource 
Plan does not adequately meet 
the Council’s recycling and 
solid 
waste 
goals; 
moving 

toward a financially sustainable 
Zero Waste plan. As a result, the 

city is in the process of drafting 
a revised plan for 2018 and has 
already released a Request for 
Proposal.

“The plan does not adequately 

identify or address steps to get 
to zero waste,” Smith wrote in 
an email interview. “We also 
need to look at how we pay 
for solid waste, recycling and 
compost services.”

However, 

miscommunication 
between 

the City Council and the 
Environmental 
Commission 

raised concerns about the status 
of the Solid Waste Fund. Based 
on a staff report, Susan Hutton 
spoke before the Council at last 
month’s meeting and discussed 
her concerns of drastic Solid 
Waste Fund decreases and 
understaffing.

“In 2015, the Solid Waste 

Fund 
balance 
was 
$15.1 

million,” Hutton said. “In 2019, 
the fund is projected to fall to 
$3.2 million, a drop of almost 
$12 million in four years. $5.2 
million was spent on retirement 
expenses, which was necessary.

University president talks Nassar trial, DACA protections, free speech in interview

The 
Daily 
sat 
down 
with 

University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel to get his take on 
sexual assault charges against 
ex-USA gymnastics team doctor 
Larry Nassar, ongoing negotiations 
with white supremacist Richard 
Spencer 
and 
protections 
for 

undocumented students on campus.

While he declined to comment 

on specific methods by which 

the Michigan State University 
administration, 
including 
the 

heavily criticized MSU President 
Lou Anna Simon, can work to 
take responsibility for the years 
of abuse Nassar inflicted upon his 
victims, Schlissel pivoted to how 
his administration is attempting to 
promote spaces in which survivors 
of sexual assault feel safe to speak 
out on campus.

Sexual 
Assault 
and 

Misconduct: The Larry Nassar 
Trial

Survivors of sexual assault and 

harassment continue to make waves 

around the country by coming 
forward with impact statements 
against 
Nassar, 
a 
University 

alum and former Michigan State 
University doctor, at his sentencing 
trial in Ingham County. Nassar pled 
guilty to seven counts of first degree 
sexual 
misconduct 
in 
Ingham 

County and three counts in Eaton 
County, including sexual assault 
and abuse of girls as young as six 
years old.

Schlissel provided his sympathy 

and 
respect 
for 
survivors, 

acknowledging the courage it takes 
for survivors to come forward with 

their testimonies.

“My heart goes out to what 

appear to be hundreds of victims 
of 
a 
corrupt 
physician 
who 

committed multiple illegal acts 
over an extended period of time,” 
he said. “The young women in 
particular who came forward to 
tell their stories, which were very 
personal and uniformly awful, in a 
public setting and the media, (are) 
brave people and my heart goes out 
to them and I hope that they can 
recover and heal from what sounds 
like the worst experience I could

All of the other $6.7 million was 
not.”

In contrast to Hutton’s data 

from the staff meeting, City 
Administrator Howard Lazarus 
emphasized 
the 
inaccurate 

statistics 
presented 
to 
the 

Environmental Commission.

“There was a presentation 

made to the environmental 
commission that was incorrect 
in terms of the fund status,” 
Lazarus said. “The Solid Waste 
Fund is actually in reasonable 
shape. 
The 
fund 
balance 

actually is not dropping in the 
way it was represented and it’s 
not because of staffing.”

According 
to 
Craig 

Hupy, 
public 
service 
area 

administrator, the Solid Waste 
Fund revenue in an average year 
is approximately $14 million 
and will only drop significantly 
if a drastic scenario occurs. 

However, 
Lazarus 
reported 

higher projected numbers for 
the end of the fiscal year than 
Hupy.

“The end of year balance 

for the Solid Waste Fund is 
forecasted for the end of the 
fiscal year to be $22 million,” 
Lazarus said. “There’s a drop in 
what’s called the unrestricted 
fund balance, this is at $8.5 
million, but that’s forecasted 
to rebound in the fiscal year of 
2019 to go up to $10 million.”

The Solid Waste Fund sources 

primarily 
from 
dedicated 

property tax millage, according 
to Lazarus. Both recycling and 
solid waste are supported by 
the Solid Waste Fund. Smith 
explained in an email interview 
the closing of the Materials 
Recovery Facility significantly 
impacted the fund.

“Two 
major 
things 
have 

impacted the fund — The first 
is 
recycling; 
the 
shutdown 

of 
the 
materials 
recovery 

facility or MRF has resulted 

in 
significantly 
higher 
cost 

for recycling at the same time 
markets for these materials 
have declined,” Smith wrote. 
“Second, 
the 
fund 
had 
to 

account for pension and other 
post employment, which was a 
huge hit to the fund balance. On 
the plus side, the new landfill 
contract is 30 percent cheaper 
than our previous one, which 
about offsets the increased 
recycling cost, but what creates 
long term deficits though is the 
MRF, which cannot be safely 
operated 
without 
significant 

investment.”

Mayor Christopher Taylor 

released 
a 
recycling 
report 

explaining 
the 
termination 

of the City’s contract with 
ReCommunity, 
the 
former 

operator of the MRF, and their 
new relationship with Recycle 
Ann Arbor. The new agreement 
is not a long-term, sustainable 
solution but is functioning as a 
temporary service.

“The MRF remains inactive, 

but 
RAA 
utilizes 
the 

location 
to 
organize 

and loose load materials 
for hauling to recovery 
facilities 
in 
Ohio 
and 

Taylor, MI,” Taylor wrote 
in the statement. “Although 
hauling recyclables to Ohio 
is not a long term solution, 
the facility does provide 
improved glass recycling.”

Based 
on 
Hutton’s 

report before the Council 
in December, the City’s 
inadequate staffing is a 
major factor in the Fund’s 
drop.

“Between 
2010 
and 

2014 the City lost four 
experienced solid waste Full 
Time Equivalents and did 
not replace them,” Hutton 
said. “The City has one FTE 
in field operations and a few 
positions with some solid 
waste responsibility. The 
position you authorized in 
2016 still remains unfilled. 
The City is deferring this 
hire until it updates the 
Solid Waste Plan, which 
expires at the end of this 
month.”

However, 
Communications 

Specialist 
Robert 
Kellar 

discounted 
Hutton’s 
report, 

saying 
staffing 
is 
not 
the 

primary concern, since the City 
has had similar levels of staff 
in solid waste as six years ago. 
Hupy also claimed the City has 
accounted for FTEs over the 
past several years.

“We only have one FTE 

open right now and we’re 
interviewing for it,” Hupy said. 
“So the FTE’s that we’ve had 
have been pretty consistent over 
the last six years and as we’ve 
had turnover we’ve filled them.”

Overall, Hupy emphasized 

prioritizing different aspects 
of the plan based on the City 
Council’s goals toward zero 
waste.

“Part of the planning effort 

will have to be prioritization of 
what items get done first and 
with what resources,” Hupy 
said. “This isn’t an unlimited 
amount of money so you have 
to decide what gets done first so 
that’s why the solid waste plan 
goes back through council so 
they can mold it to make sure it 
reflects their values.”

Kellar highlighted recycling 

as the primary concern for the 
2018 Solid Waste Plan based on 
the community’s priorities.

“Recycling is part of our 

sustainability goals, whether it 
costs the city money or makes 
the city money within the 
Solid Waste Fund, we’re going 
to continue doing it because it 
something the community has 
said is of value,” Kellar said.

The 
City 
is 
reportedly 

satisfied 
with 
the 
current 

status of the Solid Waste Fund. 
The new plan aims to fulfill 
zero waste goals but will be 
changing their approach toward 
recycling through community 
collaboration in the process.

“I think people have looked at 

recycling in one way for a very 
long time because it was a very 
stable and an under-the-radar 
market, but that has changed 
dramatically so people are going 
to have to think about recycling 
in new ways,” Kellar said.

you see how much harder it is 
for you in the field. When you do 
poorly on a test, you think it’s just 
because of you, whereas men tend 
to externalize their failures.”

The 
feelings 
Danes 
and 

Tushman describe are common 
among many women, according 
to Economics Prof. Linda Tesar. 
Tesar said data points to women 
thinking their failures are more 
about 
themselves, 
with 
men 

thinking the opposite.

“There’s a lot of evidence out 

there that men and women respond 
to grade signals in different ways,” 
Tesar said. “Women students 
interpret that it’s more about their 
ability, whereas men tend to — 
now, I’m grossly exaggerating — on 
average men tend to interpret the 
grade signal as external to them; 
the class, the GSI, and less about 
their ability.”

Tesar is part of a team of 

faculty and lecturers studying 
the experiences of women and 
underrepresented minorities in 
the economics program: Gender 
Learning Analytics at Michigan-
Economics. In order to encourage 
these populations to continue 
studying economics, GLAM-E is 
looking into data like the differing 
interpretations of grades, and their 
implications.

“We’re studying that data and 

learning about what the grade 
signal means and whether having 
a low GPA in a class perhaps is 
discouraging students that we 
don’t want to discourage from 
going forward,” Tesar said.

GLAM-E’s end goal is to 

encourage 
women 
to 
pursue 

economics as a career by imparting 
younger 
women 
with 
more 

mentors; right now, the gender 
distribution is far from ideal. Out 
of 71 faculty members listed on the 
Economics Department website, 
only 15 are women. George Fenton, 
a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics 
Department, said in his first two 
years he has not been taught by 
a single female faculty member. 
LSA senior Reema Kaakarli said 
she has had one female economics 
professor in her four years.

The Economics Department 

at 
the 
University 
holds 
an 

alumni panel each year called 
Economics@Work. 
This 
year, 

seven of the nine alumni speakers 
are men. Rackham student Ivy 
Tran said she has noticed the 
imbalance.

“One thing that I thought was 

really interesting though is a lot 

of alumni events held by the Econ 
Department — the alumni tends 
to be male, given the nature that I 
can imagine about twenty or thirty 
years ago, it was predominantly a 
male field,” Tran said.

Economics lecturer Mitchell 

Dudley organizes this panel. In 
an email interview, he expressed 
the difficulty he has in finding a 
diverse set of alumni.

“Given that I don’t have access 

to a master list of alumni, I must 
rely largely on recommendations,” 
he wrote. “In this case, I struggle 
to present a demographically 
diverse set of speakers. This is 
truly frustrating at times.”

Tushman said in her core 

economics classes, she’d always 
seek out a female GSI even if that 
GSI weren’t her own. She talked 
about the need for more female 
role models, and how inspiring it 
was when she saw Janet Yellen, 
the chair of the Federal Reserve, 
speaklast year. 

“It’s important to have people 

to look up to,” Tushman said. “We 
got to go see Janet Yellen when 
she came, and that was one of the 
coolest things that’s ever happened 
to me.”

Even 
on 
the 
level 
of 

economic textbooks, women are 
underrepresented. 
Stevenson 

conducted a study with Rackham 
student 
Hanna 
Zlotnick 
on 

mentions of males and females 
in 
introductory 
economics 

textbooks, 
and 
discovered 
6 

percent of real business leaders 
mentioned are women, whereas 
they are 41 percent of made-up 
or “ordinary” people reviewed in 
examples. Stevenson discussed 
the importance of having diversity 
in textbooks in order to resonate 
with as many students as possible. 
From her study, it is clear many 
textbooks don’t fit the bill.

“We use what we have from 

the past to prepare them for the 
future,” Stevenson said. “Diversity 
has definitely improved with time, 
so textbooks from the past have 
less diversity than we want.”

LSA 
senior 
Shannon 
Hsu 

discussed 
the 
varying 
levels 

of comfort she felt in taking 
classes with different professors. 
She found she did better with 
professors that were friendlier 
and 
more 
approachable. 
She 

also noted the difference in 
discussion sections of her two 
majors: International Studies and 
Economics.

“International Studies is very 

different from Econ in that it’s very 
inclusive,” Hsu said. “It always 
feels like a safe environment, 
whereas the discussions I’ve had 

for Econ core classes have been 
more hostile in the sense that the 
GSI is only there to teach what 
is required of him, not build that 
connection with the student.”

This hostility is apparent in the 

economics field at large. Fenton 
said within the discipline when 
someone presents their research 
they are then subject to somewhat 
aggressive questions from the 
audience. He suggested this could 
be a reason women might be 
discouraged. 

“One thing I’ve realized is 

that 
the 
economics 
seminar 

environment 
all 
over 
the 

country is especially hostile and 
combative, or just downright rude 
sometimes,” Fenton said. “I don’t 
know if that’s related at all to the 
gender issue, but I do know that it’s 
a very intimidating environment, 
I know for a fact more than many 
other disciplines when it comes to 
presenting research.”

Tran agreed the economics 

environment is tough. She said she 
feels the need to be more persistent 
when voicing her opinions.

“If I’m the only female in a group 

and I say something, oftentimes I 
have to repeat myself or I have to 
speak a little bit stronger,” Tran 
said. “I have to stand my ground in 
order to be heard.”

Kaakarli said she thinks this 

intimidating culture is the main 
problem, rather than explicit bias 
or discrimination.

“I don’t know if I would say 

that there have been any outright 
incidences 
of 
discrimination,” 

Kaakarli said. “The main issue is 
just that there’s a culture that’s not 
as welcoming.”

Organizations 
such 
as 
the 

Society of Women in Economics for 
undergraduates and the Women 
in Economics group in the Ph.D. 
program provide women with 
more comfortable environments 
in order to offset this hostile one. 
Tushman, president of SWIE, 
said the goal of the organization 
is “to create an empowering space 
for women who are interested in 
economics.” SWIE holds events 
such as female alumni panels, 
study sessions and resume/cover 
letter workshops.

These problems may not be as 

visible to those they don’t directly 
affect. Fenton said he doesn’t think 
about these issues as he goes about 
his studies in economics.

“On a day-to-day basis, this is 

just not something I pay a lot of 
attention to,” he said. “That in 
itself in a way is an indictment...” 

division 
in 
the 
community. 

Others took issue with the faculty 
deploring any individual at all 
rather than judging their actions 
separately from the person.

In defense of the statement, 

SACUA 
member 
Stefan 

Szymanski, professor of sport 
management, said SACUA was 
trying their best to appease a large 
audience.

“I 
think 
there 
are 
many 

aspects of this statement that 
people might not agree with one 
hundred percent, there are bits 
of language people might change, 
so we tried to frame something 
that we thought would command 
the 
widest 
possible 
assent 

without necessarily aspiring to 
universality,” Szymanski said.

Szymanski 
also 
said 
the 

statement was an attempt to 
help and support students who 
felt 
extremely 
isolated 
and 

unsupported by faculty in light of 

the Richard Spencer issue.

English Prof. Anne Curzan, 

chair of the Academic Performance 
Committee, and Professor Ketra 
Armstrong, the Faculty Athletics 
Representative, also visited the 
Senate and discussed the academic 
performance of student-athletes.

Curzan, who served as Faculty 

Athletics Representative before 
Armstrong, spoke about how 
people at the University generalize 
the student-athlete community, 
and speak about athletics as a 
whole when they really mean 
specific teams.

“One of the things I’ve found 

while moving around campus is 
that everyone on campus is that 
everyone on campus except really 
our student athletes and the folks 
in the athletic department forget 
what large and diverse group 
students athletes are,” Curzan 
said.

Curzan also brought up the 

anxiety many student athletes feel 
about the attitude towards them 
on campus.

“The attitude towards student-

athletes on this campus is not 
always positive,” Curzan said. 
“They feel like they walk into a 
classroom and there can be an 
assumption that they are not there 
to get an education, that they are 
not a serious student. Some of 
our student-athletes choose not 
to self identify as student athletes 
because they’re worried about 
the attitudes that faculty or other 
student in the class may bring.”

Curzan highlighted all the 

various 
things 
that 
student-

athletes at the University have to 
juggle, and how exhausting it can 
be.

“If you have a swimmer in your 

class, and you have an 8:30 a.m. 
class, that student has already 
been in the pool for two hours, and 
they are going back to the pool at 3 
or 4 to swim for two more hours,” 
Curzan said.

Armstrong 
discussed 
the 

various honors that have been 
awarded to Michigan’s student-
athletes, such as the 80 Big Ten 
Distinguished Scholars, student-
athletes that have GPAs of 3.7 

or higher, and three student-
athletes at the University who 
were selected as Academic All-
Americans.

Curzan also discussed faculty 

accommodations 
for 
students 

to allow them to represent the 
University 
in 
their 
athletic 

competitions while at the same 
time being able to succeed in 
their classes. Armstrong spoke 
about 
the 
balance 
professors 

have to strike between keeping 
the integrity of the class while 
avoiding being punitive to the 
student.

Business junior Megan Schulte, 

a member of the women’s lacrosse 
team, said in an interview with 
The Daily she felt that juggling 
being an athlete and a Business 
student 
was 
difficult, 
but 

manageable if done efficiently.

“As long as I plan out my day 

and just stay on top of my work it’s 
all manageable, but it takes a lot 
of effort every day to make sure 
that I am on top of both school 
and lacrosse,” Schulte said. “The 
kids in my class have gotten a 

lot more understanding over the 
years, and the teachers, if I have 
to miss a class or anything, they 
are always so nice. I can make an 
appointment with them to go see 
them and figure out what I missed 
and make up the work as well.”

Toward the end of the meeting, 

Gina Cervetti, the chair of the 
Student 
Relations 
Advisory 

Committee, and Erik Wessel, the 
director of the Office of Student 
Conflict 
Resolution, 
came 
to 

discuss the progress made on 
the Statement of Student Rights 
and Responsibilities, which is 
to be amended in the 2018-2019 
academic year. The Statement 
outlines possible behaviors that 
are not consistent with the values 
of the University community, 
and suggests possible responses 
and sanctions to respond to such 
behaviors.

Cervetti 
said 
they 
were 

starting the process early, in 
order to increase participation 
and visibility of the amendment 
process, as well as of the Statement 
in general.

“I want to acknowledge that 

this has been a really challenging 
year for many members of our 
community, and that many of 
these challenges have related to 
campus climate and community 
norms,” Cervetti said. “I hope that 
we can approach this amendment 
cycle as an opportunity to shape 
the norms of our community 
in ways that are responsive to 
current issues on campus. The 
Statement isn’t all about sanctions. 
It’s also about who we want to 
be as a community; it describes 
a community that is safe, and 
scholarly, 
and 
equitable, 
and 

just, and revising the Statement 
to better conform with those 
values in the current time seems 
incredibly important.”

The assembly also nominated 

members of the Faculty Senate to 
sit on the nominating committee 
that will choose faculty to fill the 
three or four new Senate Advisory 
Committee on University Affairs 

imagine.”

In 
terms 
of 
administrative 

decisions surrounding the Nassar 
case, MSU President Lou Anna 
Simon has received harsh criticism 
for the ways in which she handled 
allegations against Nassar. In a 
statement released last week, Simon 
told reporters she was first made 
aware of a Title IX investigation 
into a University sports medicine 
doctor in 2014.

“I told people to play it straight 

up, and I did not receive a copy 
of the report,” she said following 
Nassar’s hearing. “That’s the truth.” 

An investigation released last 

week by the Detroit News, however, 
found over the two decades before 
Nassar’s arrest, at least 14 MSU 

officials were notified of allegations, 
“with no fewer than eight women 
reporting his actions.” Calls for 
Simon’s resignation have come from 
a variety of sources, including state 
legislators, editorials from the State 
News and Lansing State Journal, 
as well as from MSU trustee Mitch 
Lyons, the first trusteeto call for her 
resignation.

The Board of Trustees, however, 

announced 
Thursday 
would 

support Simon and would not 
recommend she step down from her 
position.

Though Schlissel is one of 

the state’s most powerful — and 
moneyed — political stakeholders, 
when questioned on how MSU 
administration should go about 
taking responsibility or repairing 
harm done to students, he declined 
to comment.

“As for MSU and how it handled 

it, I don’t know more than I read 
about 
in 
the 
newspaper 
and 

generally when I don’t know 
more than everybody else I’m not 
really going to comment about it,” 
Schlissel said. “I just can’t add to 
the debate because I don’t have any 
special information.”

He clarified, however, sexual 

assault and misconduct have no 
place within the University of 
Michigan 
community. 
While 

the Nassar trials brought to light 
consideration of athletic teams, 
he said the issue extends to all 
students, faculty and community 
members.

“It’s not just athletic teams, here 

on this campus I’m responsible for 
45,000 students … 1,000 of them are 
student-athletes,” Schlissel said. “All 
members of our community deserve 
a workplace free of harassment and 
misconduct.”

Specific actions the University 

has 
taken 
to 
combat 
sexual 

assault and harassment, Schlissel 
explained, 
include 
mechanisms 

for 
reporting 
misconduct 
and 

education programs for students, 
faculty and staff to raise awareness 
of harmful and abusive acts and 
lessen the frequency of these 
incidents.

Sexual 
Assault 
and 

Misconduct: 
The 
Whisper 

Network

In early January, The Daily 

reported on The Whisper Network, 
a database appearing throughout 
academic communities in which 
anonymous 
contributors 
share 

their stories of sexual harassment 
and assault in academia. Since 
December, over 2,000 individuals 
have contributed to the database, 
including 14 incidents self-reported 
by alleged University affiliates, 

some of which date back to the 
1980s.

These allegations have mirrored 

conversations 
occurring 
across 

the nation and in Hollywood, 
specifically 
with 
movements 

such as #MeToo and #TimesUp 
encouraging survivors to speak 
out against perpetrators. With 
allegations 
against 
well-known 

members of the public and media, 
including 
Harvey 
Weinstein, 

Matt Lauer, James Franco, Al 
Franken and Michael Oreskes, 
dialogue surrounding the issue has 
continued to grow in academia and 
less publicized settings.

Schlissel stated the coming 

forward of survivors in communities 
across the nation and abroad, 
regardless of level of previous fame, 
allows for an increase in awareness 
and the encouragement for more 
survivors to continue telling their 

stories.

“The famous and non-famous 

stepping forward to tell their stories 
I think has a powerful effect, a 
positive, powerful effect,” Schlissel 
said. “If there’s a silver lining to 
the #MeToo moment that we’re 
living in, is the increased awareness 
and the very brave example set 
by people who’ve stepped up and 
spoken about episodes, have made 
others more likely to step forward 
and report which is a good thing, 
and has just raised everyone’s 
cautiousness about the mutual 
respect that everyone deserves 
when we treat one another.”

At the University — and at 

campuses across the country — 
reporting rates remain low for 
survivors of assault. 

“Almost half of our student body 

is out of state, a lot of students take 
this break time to go home, and we 
think it’s actually a good mental 
health initiative because students 
are juggling getting out of town and 
travel plans,” Keller said. “I have 
certainly seen students bringing 
suitcases into exams … and that’s 
a big concern because we don’t 
think students should have to be 
worrying about these two things 
simultaneously.”

Keller cited Carnegie Mellon 

University as one of several schools 
that have successfully implemented 
similar 
policies. 
He 
affirmed 

student feedback and discussion 
with professors and administration 
will 
be 
instrumental 
to 
the 

development of this policy.

Several members of the council 

expressed reservations limiting 
this policy to only certain breaks, 
such as Thanksgiving and Spring 

Break, as opposed to Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day and the fall 
study break. Other representatives 
expressed their appreciation of 
finishing all of their exams directly 
before break.

“In general the feelings at the 

School of Public Health are we 
really like having it on the last day 
of class, and then we’re done,” CSG 
representative Taylor Sullivan said, 
who is a Public Health student.

The majority of representatives 

agreed this policy would be 
effective for Thanksgiving and 
Spring Break, especially for post-
break days. CSG Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Public Policy 
senior, highlighted the importance 
of taking a mental rest over 
designated vacations.

“I think it’s just worth exploring 

what that means because when you 
only have a nine-day break, or a six-
day break, and then you have to use 
five of those days to study for a Bio 
exam that is the day after, which 
is what happened to me my spring 
break, that took away my entire 

break,” Jawad said.

Later, LSA senior Joe Goldberg, 

chief of staff to the CSG president, 
presented a resolution to fund and 
join a partnership with Michigan 
Hillel to bring Cherie Brown, CEO 
and co-founder of the National 
Coalition Building Institute, to lead 
a training on the manifestations of 
contemporary anti-Semitism.

“The idea is that CSG will 

hopefully 
contribute 
some 

financial sum, as well as encourage 
representatives on the executive 
and legislative levels to attend the 
training,” Goldberg said.

The 
council 
concluded 
by 

discussing initiatives to spread 
awareness of the Big Ten Voting 
Challenge, a competition in which 
all 14 universities in the Big Ten 
Conference 
seek 
to 
increase 

voter registration and turnout 
in the student population. While 
no 
specific 
committee 
action 

was taken, CSG representative 
Naomi 
Wilson, 
a 
Rackham 

student, mentioned that she sent 
information in their newsletter.

M

y first class of the 
winter semester was 
an 8:30 a.m. physics 

class. I sat in the middle row — 
toward the right side — and sipped 
my coffee, hoping that the caffeine 
would kick in soon so I could make 
it through that first day. After the 
lecture ended, I started packing 
my notebook away and took stock 
of the room. There were only 
about 15 people in the class, all 
of whom were men, which was 
strange to me. There usually is not 
a high representation of women in 
most of the physics classes I have 
taken, but this is the first time 
that I had a class exclusively with 
men. It was almost as if, when I 
stepped through the door of that 
classroom, I had been transported 
back in time.

This got me thinking about 

other classes I have taken as 
a physics student. There were 
always more men than women 
in these classes, and my major 
definitely lacks diversity with 
respect to gender. In recent years 
there has been a big push to get 
women into STEM fields, and 
there has been progress, but what 
more can be done?

To answer this question, I 

wanted to understand some of 
the experiences women have 
to go through in their scientific 
careers. On Tuesday, Jan. 16 I 
sat down to talk with Christine 
Aidala, an associate professor 
in the department of physics, 
about her experiences and her 
journey to where she is now. 
Aidala’s research is focused on 
nucleon structure and quantum 
chromodynamics, the theory of 
the strong nuclear force.

We started our conversation 

talking about her undergraduate 
experience. Aidala attended Yale 
in the late ‘90s. When I asked 
her if there were any programs 
that promoted women in science, 
she said she was never aware of 
any, and it just wasn’t something 
that was talked about at the time. 
There weren’t many women in her 
classes either.

“I was definitely in the minority 

in a lot of my classes,” Aidala said. 
“It was more extreme among 
the faculty. There was only one 
woman who was in the faculty in 
the physics department, and there 
were over 50 faculty total.”

During this time, it was no 

surprise that women were the 
minority in undergraduate science 
and engineering programs. It 
was also common to have few, if 
any, women mentors within your 
own department. According to 
the National Science Foundation 
and their 2016 indicators report, 
in 1993 only 9.7 percent of 
full professors of science and 
engineering in the United States 
were women. It is better now, 
but still not amazing. According 
to the same report, women held 
only 24.2 percent of these full 
professor positions in 2013. I hope, 
as do many people in science, 
that this trend will continue as 
younger women in science and 

engineering rise to positions of 
greater leadership.

However, it is hard to close 

this gap if women feel that 
they are in an unwelcoming 
environment. Aidala said that the 
physics department at Yale was 
overall supportive of its students, 
no matter what gender, but 
sometimes it just takes one bad 
experience or one awful person to 
make you feel uneasy.

“I had issues with harassment by 

one engineer, 20 years older than 
me, in the physics department,” 
Aidala said. “I was fortunate that 
a senior professor saw what was 
going on, intervened and helped 
me. I didn’t say anything to him 
directly because it gets tricky to 
figure out what to say and when.”

When Aidala was telling me 

this story, I began to realize how 
hard it would be for someone 
to speak out against this type 
of behavior. This past year has 

seen a great wave of women 
sharing their experiences and 
people coming together to back 
up these women. This amount 
of support was not present while 
Aidala was an undergrad, and 
without it, it’s hard to know 
where to turn if incidents occur. 
Part of the barrier to entry of a 
scientific field can be that feeling 
of not belonging because of an 
experience such as this one.

When you do have support, 

however, it can boost your 
confidence and make you feel 
accepted. 
When 
Aidala 
was 

in her Ph.D. program, she and 
her husband wanted to start a 
family. She was not sure what 
the reaction would be from 
people she worked with when 
she told them that she was 
pregnant. Except for one person 
who explicitly told her she was 
ruining her career, she received 
a great amount of support from 
everyone. This made it easy to 

brush off the negative comments.

“When I told my senior 

professor in my thesis group, 
he said, ‘This will be a first 
for the Department of Energy 
group!’” Aidala said. “It was as 
if the group was having a baby. 
It was unexpected, but it 
was a really unambiguous 
expression of support.”

In the final minutes of our 

interview, I asked Aidala if she 
thought that the University of 
Michigan is currently doing 
enough to accept women into 
scientific fields or if there was 
more to be done.

“I think there should be a place 

to study physics here for everyone 
who wants to,” Aidala said. “I 
think we can always do more 
to be welcoming of everyone, 
and not just in physics, but 
everywhere,” Aidala said, noting 
that an accepting environment 
will lead to more women, or 

anyone for that matter, pursuing 
scientific research.

Exposing young students to 

women scientists and creating 
programs to inspire young women 
to pursue science are great ways to 
increase representation in STEM 
fields, but there is something that 
every single person can do. Treat 
everyone with respect. Every 
professor, every graduate student, 
even every undergraduate student 
currently studying a scientific 
field needs to make an effort to 
welcome more women into their 
area of science. Reach out; be 
interested in what someone has 
to say and respect boundaries. 
Offer your own support, because 
while big university programs are 
a great resource, it all comes down 
to individual interactions and 
connections between people.

Respect will draw more women into STEM

ROBERT DALKA | COLUMN

I 

was first introduced to the 
concept of a cooperative while 
researching campus life at 

various universities during high 
school. I stumbled upon the website 
of the University of California-
Berkeley’s Lothlorien, which seemed 
nothing short of magical: a house in 
which roughly 60 students cook and 
share living space with one another, 
refer to themselves as “elves,” hang 
out in their very own tree house and 
contribute to a communal mural.

Since coming to the University 

of Michigan, I’ve gotten more 
familiar with the sizes, forms and 
functions of cooperative businesses 
and organizations. Many co-ops 
are nestled throughout Ann Arbor, 
like 
the 
People’s 
Food 
Co-op 

grocery store, the University of 
Michigan Credit Union and the 
16 student houses operated by the 
Inter-Cooperative 
Council. 
The 

ICC also hosts the North American 
Students of Cooperation conference 
each year, in which members from 
student housing co-ops across the 
continent stay in Ann Arbor for 
a weekend, hold workshops and 
discuss issues pertinent to the 
cooperative movement.

According to the ICC’s website, 

co-ops exist in a range of sectors 
and are alike in being “owned and 
operated collectively, for the mutual 
benefit of their members.” Housing 
co-ops specifically run on principles 
such as affordability, democratic 
membership 
and 
participation, 

sustainability, political engagement, 
individual 
contribution 
and 

community-building.

I’m now closing out my second 

year living at Vail, a stucco Kerrytown 
home framed by several porches 
on the outside, a maze of hallways 
on the inside and a backyard fondly 
described by house members as a 
jungle. As I search the web of housing 
options for my first post-university 
home in Cincinnati, I can’t find too 
many intentional communities in 
the area.

And though I’m disappointed, 

I’m not surprised. Co-ops are a niche 
housing option and account for only 
about one percent of all housing 
units in the United States. They’re 

more common in some major cities, 
such as New York City and Chicago, 
but much harder to find in other 
areas. Moreover, public knowledge 
of cooperative living is lacking; ICC 
houses aren’t well known as a living 
option among most students even 
here in Ann Arbor, where they’ve 
existed since the 1930s and housed 
over 20,000 people.

Cooperative housing models lie 

on a spectrum of affordability and 
degree of shared space and co-living 
situations somewhat overlap with 
housing co-ops in style. I believe 
the ICC and other student housing 
co-ops set an example by consciously 
intersecting 
a 
commitment 
to 

affordability 
and 
intentional 

community building. This, in turn, 
creates a uniquely sustainable and 
enjoyable kind of living environment 
that should expand beyond the realm 
of college campuses, for people of 
any age.

Firstly, co-ops offer an affordable 

alternative to typical living situations, 
like apartments or dorms. According 
to MLive, rent for off-campus 
housing in Ann Arbor averages at 
$1,085 per month for a four-bedroom 
unit to $1,402 per month for a studio 
apartment. Co-ops are by far the 
cheapest housing option for students 
living in Ann Arbor itself, mitigating 
their need to commute from a 
nearby town with lower average 
rent like Ypsilanti.

They essentially keep costs low 

through member ownership, as 
opposed to paying rent to an external 
landlord, and pooling resources for 
bulk food and amenities. My house 
charges have averaged around $600 
per month. This encompasses rent 
for a fully furnished room, utilities 
and a meal plan that includes several 
dinners per week and guff (general 
unspecified free food) items.

It goes without saying that 

affordability is meaningful for college 
students. But for anyone who is of 
lower socioeconomic status, or unable 
to afford steep rent in areas with a 
high cost of living or simply looking to 
save money, this setup gives them an 
incomparable opportunity and relief.

Secondly, co-ops tap into people’s 

fundamental need to be social and 

spend time with one another. The 
spirit of shared experiences and 
inclusion I have seen in the co-ops 
has completely altered my experience 
as an upperclassman. Living in a 
co-op has given me a network of 
friends with shared interests and 
an integrated support system. Lara 
Moehlman’s piece in the Daily on ICC 
culture and history further illustrates 
how the structure and traditions 
of co-ops establish a sense of home 
within a large college campus.

I’ve 
loved 
studying 
with 

housemates in our peach-colored 
living room, discovering our bin of 
nutritional yeast and sprinkling it 
on our shared dinners, hosting open 
mics where friends show off their 
musical talent, hugging our giant 200-
year old oak tree, munching on guff 
berries, beautifying our home during 
“work holiday,” exploring other 
members’ rooms during themed 
in-house progressive parties and 
impromptu swims at the docks along 
the Huron River.

My visits to other co-ops have felt 

just as special — lounging in Owen’s 
hammocks, petting cats at Ruths, 
fetching free Zingerman’s bread for 
Linder, hula hooping at Debs, playing 
in Black Elk’s ball pit and grooving at 
Truth’s pajama parties.

These 
kinds 
of 
experiences 

thrive when people pool resources 
and space, build a mindset of 
interdependence, work to further 
a shared purpose and develop a 
common culture. For example, 
Vail focuses on sustainability, with 
vegetarian meals, a compost pile 
and a garden. Many members are 
politically active and our basement 
serves as a music venue for local 
artists

Other ICC co-ops come together 

with 
different 
missions 
and 

atmospheres, but their common 
emphasis 
on 
affordability 
and 

community can set an example for 
future homes in the U.S. These kinds 
of cooperative lifestyles should be 
available to people of all ages — I 
hope to find more of them cropping 
up soon.

T

he Thursday before last, 
President 
Trump 
met 

with lawmakers in the 

Oval Office to discuss a bipartisan 
immigration plan. The plan involved 
cutting the visa lottery in half, with 
the rest going to underrepresented 
countries in Africa and Temporary 
Protective 
Status 
nations 
such 

as Haiti. Sources who attended 
the meeting have confirmed the 
president 
made 
the 
following 

statements: In reference to the people 
from Africa included in the plan, 
Trump stated: “Why do we want all 
these people from ‘shithole countries’ 
coming here?” Furthermore, Trump 
specifically targeted people from 
Haiti when he said, “Why do we need 
more Haitians? Take them out.”

To say that these statements 

are 
“insensitive” 
is 
a 
gross 

understatement. A better description 
would be deplorable, disgraceful, 
shameful and, not to mention, 
inaccurate. The entire incident 
is reflective of an administration 
with failing character. It is 
reflective of a current mindset 
in this country that is racist, 
uninformed and narrow-minded.

Over the past year, I have noticed 

a disturbing pattern on the news. 
Every day, there is a new story about 
President Trump, and it is always 
something more shocking than the 
previous day. It makes watching the 
news feel like more of a reality TV 
show than “Keeping Up with the 
Kardashians,” and the shock value 
of his recent comments about Africa 
and Haiti undoubtedly boosted 
ratings. However, the presidency 
was not created for the purpose of 
entertainment. The president of the 
United States is regarded as the most 
powerful leader in the modern world. 
We are treating this presidency like 
our very own reality TV show.

Enough is enough. The American 

people are not an audience of viewers. 
The 
consequences 
of 
Trump’s 

behavior are vast, and someone needs 
to hold him accountable before it is 
too late.

The first step in holding the 

president 
accountable 
for 
his 

dangerous behavior requires being 
informed enough to dispel his never-
ending spout of lies. As Africa and 
Haiti are his most recent targets, let’s 
use them as an example. It is unclear 
how the president himself determines 
whether or not a country is a shithole. 
However, if we look at some basic data 

on global development, his ignorance 
on the matter becomes pretty clear. 
The president probably doesn’t know 
that, according to Business Insider, 
“six of the world’s 10 fastest growing 
economies of the past decade are in 
sub-Saharan Africa.” Additionally, 
Botswana serves as a stark example 
of Africa’s economic and political 
advances. According to the World 
Bank, “Since gaining independence 
from the United Kingdom, Botswana 
has been one of the world’s fastest 
growing economies, averaging 5 
percent per annum over the past 
decade.” It also has “a stable political 
environment with a multi-party 
democratic tradition.” This is a pretty 
far cry from Trump’s self-described 
“shithole,” wouldn’t you say?

Moving on to the people of 

Haiti, who the president doesn’t 
think contribute to his America. 
In 2010, a devastating earthquake 
struck the people of Haiti, which 
led to the displacement of 1.5 million 
people. Hundreds of thousands of 
earthquake victims sought refuge in 
the United States under a temporary 
visa that is set to expire on Jan. 22. 
Currently, Haitians account for less 
than 2 percent of the U.S. foreign-
born 
population, 
but 
President 

Trump doesn’t think that we need 
any more and wants to “take them 
out” of the country. Once again, 
it is unclear exactly what the 
president’s problem with Haitian 
people is, but one can assume there 
is prejudiced undertones.

I wonder if the president knows 

that Haiti, as a former slave colony, 
was the site of the first successful 
modern slave rebellion. Or about 
the huge contribution that Haitians 
made to the United States when 
Thomas Jefferson was able to 
acquire the Louisiana Territory — 
which comprises one-fourth of our 
nation’s continuous land mass — 
from Napoleon because the French 
general, among other woes, was 
unable to subdue Haitian troops 
trained by Toussaint L’Ouverture, 
a Black Haitian general. Without 
Haitian people, this country would 
not be as powerful as it is today. As 
we are a nation built by the hands of 
immigrants, this should come as no 
surprise; apparently our president 
isn’t educated on how his privilege 
came about.

Of course, President Trump 

didn’t just become a racist. It has 
been a disturbing part of his career. 

During the 2016 election, it was 
building a wall to keep out Mexican 
immigrants. Last year, it was the 
Islamophobia-filled 
Muslim 
ban. 

Now, it is his rhetoric against the 
people of Africa and Haiti. And that is 
just a brief history of people who have 
been targeted by the ignorant, unwise 
bigot who is our president. A quick 
Google search will turn up dozens 
more alarming incidents of racism, 
sexism and xenophobia. The list goes 
on and on.

With the Trump administration, 

every day is a new story. Our 
president is a former reality star, and 
his politics have become a reality TV 
show. The proof is in the numbers: 
The first quarter of 2017 was CNN’s 
most-watched quarter in 14 years 
and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow held 
the number one spot for the 25-54 
age demographic at 9 p.m. in March. 
Recently, “Keeping Up With the 
Kardashians” just celebrated its 14th 
season along with a boost in ratings 
that likely stems from all of those Kylie 
Jenner pregnancy rumors. Clearly, 
the American public thrives on being 
entertained. Except in the case of the 
Trump presidency, the consequences 
of entertainment oftentimes involve 
people’s lives. This is most alarming 
to me. Who is going to start taking 
his words more seriously? How many 
more seasons will President Trump 
be renewed for?

To me, the way that the President 

spoke about the people of Africa and 
Haiti reflects deep-rooted racist 
values that are inherent among his 
followers, one of the most outspoken 
of which is Richard Spencer, an alt-
right white nationalist. As a student at 
the University of Michigan, I cannot 
help but think about the possibility 
that Richard Spencer will be allowed 
to speak on our campus. To me, it 
shouldn’t even be a question: free 
speech or not, there is no room for 
hate speech on this campus. Yet, the 
debate still continues in a manner 
that is eerily similar to the presidency. 
Again, I ask: Who is going to stand up 
and condemn racism once and for all?

At the time of this writing, it is 

Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, and 
I cannot help but wonder what Dr. 
King would have to say about all of 
this. To quote him, “Our lives begin 
to end the day we become silent about 
things that matter.”

Keeping Up With the Trumps

Tuesday, January 23, 2018 — 5

There seems to be a trend in our 
society where once the calendar 
switches to Jan. 1st, we begin a 
new plan of exercising, self-care 
and dieting. The gym gets packed, 
people get yoga class packages and 
fridges become full with fruits and 
veggies. Typically, we stick with 
these goals for the month of Jan., 
but it seems to go all downhill after 
that.
Reasons for this vary, whether 
it be school or work or extra 
commitments. We let the first few 
weeks of the new year bring us 
hope for a fresh start, and we turn 
these hopes and resolutions into 
actions. But I can’t help but argue 
that this fitness plan we all hope to 
achieve doesn’t have to begin in the 
first month of the new year, and it 
certainly doesn’t have to end there. 
Resolutions of self-care and healthy 
lifestyles can be put into action at 
any time of the year, and we don’t 
have to give up on these goals as the 
year progresses.
Of course, keeping yourself 
motivated or starting a new routine 
in the middle of the year is easier 
said than done. But that’s my 
question, not only for myself, but 
others who do the same: Why is it 
so difficult to start over at any time 
or to maintain our resolutions?
I won’t lie. I love setting New 
Year’s resolutions, especially when 
they pertain to my mental wellness 
and physical health. I was the person 
who rarely swam last semester, but 
I’ve started to hit the pool again. I 
was also the one who never cooked 
for myself and ate absolute junk, 
but since the new year, I have now 
made almost every meal at home 
a healthy one. I acknowledge 
these accomplishments and new 
types of behavior — and I want to 
congratulate myself — but in some 
way, I feel guilty.
I realize that it took me until 

the new year of 2018 to start over 
and reconsider my lifestyle, when 
realistically, I needed to begin 
this health kick and revive my 
motivation months ago. I watched 
not only myself, but also some of my 
friends, become mentally affected 
by their lack of physical health and 
vice versa. With full consciousness, 
I saw my aspirations for healthy 
habits go down the drain.

This lack of motivation and 
eagerness to give up is somehow 
rooted in the pressures of the 
new 
year. 
There’s 
a 
mutual 
encouragement that Jan. is a great 
month to start new routines and to 
become motivated again — there’s 
no doubt there. Nonetheless, we’re 
stuck in this idea of “new year, new 
you,” and that the turn of another 
year is the time, and the only time, 
to begin again. Although it seems 
that we know this to not be true, we 
follow it anyway.
Other than time itself, there 
are other factors that play a role 
in delaying our desired lifestyles. 
We allow other commitments and 
plans to come before the gym or 
to come before cooking a well-
balanced meal. Sometimes we feel 
like we have to finish the essay 
before we sit down to meditate, or 
we would rather go to the movies 
than put on our running shoes. We 

make the excuse that we don’t have 
time to do it all, but I recently lived 
the simple and cliché revelation 
that is, “you have to make the time 
to do it.”
After this hiatus of exercising, I 
came full circle and acknowledged 
how absolutely difficult it is to start 
fresh again, but also that it’s not 
impossible. It’s that nervousness 
one feels when they leave the house 
for the first time in a long time 
to go out and exercise. There’s a 
worrisome notion that we have 
other and more important things 
to do rather than execute a healthy 
lifestyle. But that’s what designs 
this type of lifestyle: It’s not about 
trading one for the other, it’s 
factoring in exercise and self-care 
into our daily routines.
That’s where I, and maybe so 
many others, went wrong. I saw 
my plan of getting fit again as a 
burden, as something that I had 
to do, as another thing on my 
plate. It stressed me out. But once 
I felt my blood pumping and my 
body generating endorphins, I 
discovered how badly I needed 
exercise (and not just for the 
month of Jan.). I’ve decided to 
implement these healthy actions 
into my everyday life, and I’m 
starting to become fully conscious 
of the effects, both mentally and 
physically. Now that it has become 
a habit, I believe there’s nothing 
stopping me.
The new year doesn’t always 
have to be the starting line. Even 
for those of us who do use it as 
the starting line, it doesn’t mean 
we lose track of the race a couple 
weeks in. Being confident in our 
goals, applying them every day, 
creating that routine and realizing 
that we can begin again whenever 
and wherever — these are all 
components of maintaining our 
health plans and goals.

New Year, new plan?

‘Call Me By Your Name’ is 
an artful portrait of love

Words are only part of a story. 
What connects words, the silence 
and observations, the sensory 
details that provide feeling, are 
just as vital. In “Call Me By Your 
Name,” director Luca Guadagnino 
(“A Bigger Splash”) paints a 
palpable visual splendor for us, as 
he renders a love story that unfolds 
between Elio Perlman (Timothée 
Chalamet, “Ladybird”) and Oliver 
(Armie 
Hammer, 
“Nocturnal 
Animals”), 
when 
feelings 
overcome words.
The film, based on the novel 
by André Aciman, traces Elio, 
a 
17-year-old 
French, 
Italian, 
Jewish amalgam, who spends 
his adolescent summers in an 
idyllic, magical town in Northern 
Italy, where his days consist of 
transcribing music and reading 
by quaint ponds. His routine is 
disrupted when his archaeologist-
professor father, played by Michael 
Stuhlbarg (“The Shape of Water”) 
hosts Oliver, an American student, 
for six weeks as part of his studies. 
Oliver’s crude Americanism stands 
out from the Perlmans’ understated 
European sophistication, from his 
oversized, ill-fitting dress shirts, to 
his overuse of the phrase “later,” 

to the aggressive, ill-mannered 
way he cracks open an egg shell, 
devouring it primitively, like an 
American would. Upon Oliver’s 
arrival, Elio is intrigued.
Guadagnino illustrates a serene 
and relaxed summer landscape 
that is an ode to Italy and Greco-

Roman Classics. We get a feel 
for the characters’ world, with 
the aid of a sublime soundtrack. 
Through 
voyeuristic 
peeks, 
aided by a perfect mise en scène 
of immaculately-set tables with 
Nutella and juicy fruit, our senses 
become fully entranced and a part 
of their reality. We feel Italy’s dewy 
summer on our skin, and we taste 
the sticky-sweet apricot flesh on 
our tongues. The film is a tactile 
experience, almost even too lush 
and overwhelming at parts. It is 
arrestingly visceral. Sensual.
Chalamet is the obvious star 
here. Though a newcomer to the 
industry, his performances in 
both this and “Ladybird” have 

put him high on the Hollywood 
radar, 
resulting 
in 
various 
nominations, 
particularly 
up 
against adroit legends like Tom 
Hanks and Denzel Washington. 
His acting is refined and laid-back 
— the opposite of overacting. It’s 
almost too good. He mesmerizes 
us by appearing relaxed while 
paradoxically displaying a full 
range of emotions. He could fold 
shirts on screen for two hours 
straight and would somehow 
entertain us still. Their chemistry 
is tangible, but Chalamet impresses 
and outshines Hammer. But after 
all, it is his movie.
The film could’ve easily fallen 
into the cliché conventions of 
a queer love story, but it never 
does, nor does it aim to moralize. 
It is about male friendships, the 
discovering of sexuality and most 
importantly, the discovery of 
one’s place in the world, which it 
doesn’t truly answer but leaves us 
wondering.
“Call Me By Your Name” shows 
us the best parts of love and the 
absolute worst. Given the film’s 
often scant use of the verbal, there 
are simply no words to describe 
its effect. It builds you up, only 
to break you down, leaving you 
vulnerable, bawling in the theater 
with people around you looking to 
see if you are okay.

‘Black Lightning’ saves TV

Admittedly, when I first 
heard 
word 
of 
The 
CW’s 
latest action drama, “Black 
Lightning,” 
I 
felt 
myself 
internally 
combusting 
at 
the thought of yet another 
superhero show. However, in 
a major plot twist, I found DC 
Comics’s 
“Black 
Lightning” 
— with its fierce character 
dynamics, shocking realism and 
divergence from the norm — to 
be a refreshing and impressive 
jolt of energy for the genre.
Black 
Lightning’s 
origins 
and means of introduction are 
different from the standard, 
as 
Jefferson 
Pierce 
(Cress 
Williams, “Prison Break”) has 
actually been in retirement 
from his superhero career for 
nine years, in favor of more 
subdued fighting for justice as 
a high school principal. It is 
only when both his city’s law 
and order and daughters’ safety 
are compromised by a notorious 
gang, the 100, that Jefferson is 
convinced to get back into the 
business of fighting crime and 
restoring the state of Freeland.
In 
this 
way, 
“Black 
Lightning” is not just your 
typical 
superhero 
story 
highlighting a young, suave 
renegade, fictionally fighting to 
save the girl, defeating the evil 
villain or starring in crossovers 
with other superheroes. “Black 
Lightning” doesn’t need the 
hype of an “Arrowverse” (CW’s 
superhero universe) crossover 
event to show its worth. Its 
relevance in the real world and 
spotlight on true injustice, gang 
violence and systematic racism 
is necessary representation in 
our current political landscape. 
“Black Lightning” veers beyond 
basic good vs. evil tropes, as 

for once, the “bad guy” role is 
encapsulated by two levels of 
sincerely destructive villains 
— 
Tobias 
Whale 
(Marvin 
“Krondon” Jones III, “Harry’s 
Law”), the gang kingpin of 
the 100, and the corrupted 
white police force that racially 
discriminates and profiles on 
the job.
Aside from the sharp and 
commanding performance of 
Williams as the namesake, the 
female leads are equally (if not 
more) badass and captivating in 

their portrayals and character 
potential. With the tease that 
Jefferson’s 
eldest 
daughter, 
Anissa (Nafessa Williams, “One 
Life to Live”), has inherited 
some of her dad’s powers and 
superhuman 
skills, 
it 
will 
be intriguing to see how her 
capacity for influence will be 
unveiled in the future, given 
that she is already such a social 
justice warrior. On the other 
hand, his younger daughter, 
Jennifer (China Anne McClain, 
“A.N.T. Farm”), will most likely 
undergo the expected route of 
development for her reckless, 
party-girl archetype, reigning 
in her disregard to help her 
family 
and 
leaving 
some 
spontaneity to be desired.
Another 
winning 
aspect 
of “Black Lightning” lies in 
its 
mesmerizing, 
prismatic 
soundtrack, 
which 
features 
hits 
ranging 
from 
Nina 
Simone’s soulful remake of 

Billie 
Holiday’s 
“Strange 
Fruit” to Kendrick Lamar’s 
robust “Backseat Freestyle.” 
The musical selections do a 
stunning job of enhancing the 
tense moments of the episode, 
spotlighting 
Black 
culture, 
amplifying Black voices and 
ultimately 
tying 
together 
the cinematic quality of the 
series. I found myself focused 
not only on the drama and 
turmoil 
happening 
between 
the characters, but also really 
listening to the lyrics of each 
song and uncovering their more 
profound purpose.
The only place where “Black 
Lightning” stumbles a bit is 
in some of the more logistical 
elements of a series premiere. 
Unless 
you’re 
extremely 
familiar 
with 
the 
“Black 
Lightning” comics, the average 
newcomer 
viewer 
is 
left 
majorly in the dark regarding 
the backstory of Gambi (James 
Remar, “Dexter”), Jefferson’s 
presumptive mentor, tailor and 
makeshift nurse who is inserted 
into 
the 
mix 
mid-episode. 
Besides that slight snag, the 
special effects of the episode 
came across as mediocre and 
cheesy at times, as did the fight 
scenes and costuming of our 
hero.
Setting itself apart from the 
majority of other superhero 
dramas, 
“Black 
Lightning” 
has the capability to charm 
anyone, 
from 
devoted 
DC 
die-hards to novice action-
seekers. In combination with 
a good old cliffhanger ending, 
introspective characters and 
quite a large deal of justice 
at stake, “Black Lightning” is 
stacking up to be one of The 
CW’s most thrilling breakout 
hits. This genre-bending social 
commentary 
is 
innovative 
and exactly what we’ve been 
waiting for.

FILM REVIEW

Porches plays the introvert

Porches has mastered the sound 
of the zealous introvert. At their 
core, each of his songs address 
the specific ambivalence of this 
personality. He walks by the party 
and wants to dance, but needs to be 
alone. He craves solitude, but still 
wants to give more of himself, still 
wants to love. There’s a pull to the 
outer world and a safety in hiding 
from it.
It’s fitting, then, that the home 
is the soul of his third and newest 
album, and also its namesake. On 
The House, questions that seem 
simple on the surface — whether to 
stay in or go out, whether to get up 
or go back to bed — become pivotal. 
What he decides in those moments 
represents who he is as a whole. 
Each decision is the outfit he has 
chosen to wear. That is, if he decides 
to dress up and go out at all.
Take his shift between the first 
two tracks. On “Leave the House,” 
he sings over a paced, spacious 
synth line: “I just wanna leave 
the house … / Maybe take a walk 
around.” He needs air and leads 
us to believe he’s going to set out 
to find it. It’s an uncharacteristic 
moment of willful exposure for 
an artist who produced his entire 
last album in a single bedroom in 
New York City. But immediately he 
contradicts himself. “I think I’ll stay 
inside,” he tells us in the first line 
of the absolutely gorgeous second 
track, “Find Me.” He can’t escape 
the fear of everything outside. 
It’s all about moving inwardly 
again, right when we thought he 
was moving outwardly. The song, 
ironically, is also the most generous 
and danceable on the whole album, 
complete with a huge, bouncy beat 
and an exuberant trumpet section.
Porches 
has 
increasingly 
defined his project by playing 
with this mental back and forth. 
No conversation about Porches is 
complete without ample mention of 
ambivalence — this is certainly not 
music for hardliners. Tellingly, so 
many of Porches’s verses land on a 
final line that begins with “but.”
What makes The House so much 
bigger, and so much more powerful, 
I 
daresay, 
than 
the 
already 

wonderful Pool, is that Porches 
seems to celebrate and understand 
his ambivalence better than ever 
before. There’s something beautiful 
in how assured he is in being unsure. 
He lets himself sink inwardly and 
lets himself question that desire to 
do so. He gives room for both: the 
feeling, and the reaction to it.

The 
difficulty 
of 
such 
a 
personality is how to handle the 
external — that’s a broad word, but it 
covers a lot of important bases here. 
The biggest external for Porches 
is other people. Navigating love as 
someone who needs separation 
as much as the air they breathe 
becomes a constant question: How 
do you express it? How do you give 
it in a way that your partner wants, 
when so much of yourself rests 
within rather than without?
Porches isn’t really sure. The 
conundrum is too large for a solitary 
introvert to solve. Instead, he simply 
narrates 
his 
own 
experience, 
explaining how he’s trying to 
figure it out. The result is some of 
his clearest and most emotionally 
resonant writing to date.
Nowhere 
is 
this 
better 
showcased than “By My Side,” one 
of the most arresting moments on 
an album that is filled with so many 
that stop you in wild appreciation. 
“It’s my fault / This I know / It’s just 
hard to swallow,” he sings, speaking 
to a hurt lover. But this track grows 
far deeper than just an apology. As 
much as Porches loves to be inside 
the house, he learns about himself 
by those on the outside, and when 
he says to her, “I will call you by 
your name / If you call me by mine,” 
you nearly want to cry, because 
the weight of that moment, the 
drawing of lines in the sand, is so 
instantly understood in the context 
of his own internal fight. This once 
internal question of whether to stay 
inside or go out is reflected onto 
this relationship, and then reflected 
back onto himself, altering his self-
perception. The relationship is a 
mirror, but the thing is, he doesn’t 

want it to be. That he goes on to 
say most of the time he has no idea 
who he even sees in that mirror 
is the crux of the problem. It’s the 
essence of this album. With so 
many conflicting thoughts and 
desires, how do we begin to know 
ourselves? How do we decide to 
exist?
As much as this sounds like 
a narrative, The House is better 
described as a mood. Continuing 
the trend he began on Pool, he 
creates a lot of the emotional work 
through the production. As sonic 
arrangements, these songs are well 
polished, absurdly addictive. The 
progression and crescendo of “Ono” 
does as much, if not more, work 
to translate feeling as the lyrical 
clarity of “By My Side.”
He works with a similar synth 
palette as Pool to create this 
effect, but The House sounds 
more alive, conjuring expansive 
worlds, whereas Pool contained 
itself within a singular bedroom. 
Each song is its own room, fully 
furnished, and while every room 
is consistent aesthetically with the 
last, they all offer the listener a new 
discovery, a new chaise lounge to 
dance on and a new framed photo 
to gawk at. Walking through The 
House is supremely enjoyable.
We’re guided out of the home 
on the final track, “Anything U 
Want.” He paints a scene with two 
characters: “Julie on the bed as 
warm as night falls,” and “Ricky on 
the field with some makeup on.” It’s 
a concise pastoral, a scene largely 
about love, but about the home too, 
and the country and the things we 
want to be for the people who love 
us back. Introversion is so easily 
misunderstood as selfishness, but 
here, Porches is generous to the 
point of giving himself entirely. 
He offers his world, singing “Tell 
me everything you want to hear 
/ I want you to hear it / Tell me 
anything you want to feel / I 
want you near it.” The album, 
in retrospect, was always about 
others. Even from afar they guide 
Porches through his ambivalence,

Rankine on staying in the room

JOSHUA HAN / DAILY

On Thursday, poet, essayist and 
playwright Claudia Rankine spoke 
in conversation with theatre artist 
P. Carl at the Michigan Theater. 
The room was nearly full and 
buzzing with anticipation to hear 
Rankine speak about her new 
play, “The White Card,” written in 
conjunction with Carl.
“The 
White 
Card” 
began 
as an adaptation of Rankine’s 
bestselling collection of non-
fiction 
poetry, 
“Citizen: 
An 
American 
Lyric.” 
“Citizen” 
extrapolates on the persistent 
racial tension between white 
and 
Black 
Americans, 
from 
racist 
micro-aggressions 
in 
supermarkets to overt racism 
in professional tennis, painting 
a painful and accurate picture 
of the myth of America’s “post-
racial” society.
After touring with “Citizen,” 
Rankine decided that she wanted 
to create a play that was an 
entirely different entity than her 
collection. She discovered that the 
reading of “Citizen” was the least 
interesting part of her tour. She 
was more intrigued and inspired 
by the responses of the audiences 

she was reading to across the 
country, from the unwarranted 
hostility of white men to the 
bravery of young Black women.
She then determined that the 
collaborative and communicative 
energy of theatre would be the 
most beneficial setting for a new 
work, one that was written in 
response to, what she’d witnessed 
in her audiences.
The aim of “The White Card” is 
to explore whiteness and to stage 
a continuous conversation around 
race, one that cannot be avoided 
on the premise of “good manners.” 
The 
play 
follows 
Charlotte 
Cummings, a young Black artist. 
Charlotte attends a dinner party 
with her husband hosted by white 
art dealers in New York City in 
hopes of selling her art to them. 
The dinner party quickly spirals 
into an incredibly racialized and 
hostile 
environment, 
written 
to explore the manifestation of 
racism in everyday life.
In reading this play, Rankine 
said that many young Black 
women 
asked 
the 
question, 
“Why did she stay in the room?” 
Though this made her hopeful, 
Rankine was also surprised by 
this response. In her experience, 
it was very uncommon to leave 
during a racist situation. It was 

more common to “stay in the 
room.” This is the dynamic that 
“The White Card” is exploring: 
the phenomenon of “staying in the 
room.”
Rankine and Carl elaborated 
on the difficult situations and 
dialogue within the play, with 
Carl 
claiming 
that 
Rankine 
was writing things that “no 
one would ever say.” Carl then 
caught himself, realizing that 
his experience as a white man 
was incredibly different than 
Rankine’s experience as a Black 
woman — the very theme that the 
play is encapsulating.
The play’s parallels to reality 
expand beyond Carl’s experience 
of collaborating with Rankine 
on the work. The economics of 
theatre heavily influenced the 
writing of “The White Card.” This 
economic consideration is difficult 
to grapple with in creating a work 
about race, given that consumers 
of theatre are primarily white, and 
the success of a play is essentially 
dependent on white people.
Rankine elaborated on this, 
speaking of the difficulty of 
accurately portraying what it 
is to be Black in America while 
also attempting to be careful of 
the potential discomfort of the 
white audiences the play would be 

performed for.
“This play is written for white 
people and they will be the 
audience,” Rankine said. “I can’t 
show the worst of them.”
The 
anxiety 
around 
the 
writing of the play for the sake 
of economics essentially centers 
around Rankine’s most prominent 
question: “How uncomfortable 
can we make white people?”
The 
conversation 
between 
Rankine and Carl around the 
process of the play was incredibly 
potent. 
The 
anxiety 
around 
conversations 
about 
race 
is 
omnipresent. 
Though 
these 
conversations are necessary and 
important, especially in today’s 
political environment, they are 
avoided — and this avoidance 
is usually in the name of white 
comfort.
Rankine and Carl had this 
conversation in front of a packed 
theater and continued it as white 
people began to walk toward the 
exit doors. Through “The White 
Card,” 
the 
conversation 
will 
persist.
White people must face the 
discomfort around conversations 
about 
racial 
aggression 
to 
understand it and to change it. 
We, now, must be the ones to stay 
in the room.

The University 
Philharmonia 
delivers intense 
performance 

Last 
week’s 
University 
Philharmonia 
Orchestra 
concert at Hill Auditorium 
was an impressive display of 
orchestral might on two rather 
mature and nuanced works: 
Beethoven’s 
“Symphony 
No. 8” and Strauss’s “Der 
Rosenkavalier 
Suite.” 
Both 
pieces depict humor, one of 
the 
most 
difficult 
aspects 
of 
orchestral 
performance. 
While neither piece was quite 
as humorous as one would 
expect, both were impactful 
displays by student musicians 
as they learn to play comedic 
music. 
This 
brought 
both 
pieces to moments of pure 
beauty along with occasional 
moments of confusion.
Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 
8” opened quite strong and 
continued in a triumphant, if 
slightly unbalanced, vein. The 
sudden changes in volume, 
for example, were navigated 
well. The cellos, in particular, 
performed their melody to 
great effect.
The second movement, the 
comical movement that some 
have likened to the beating of a 
metronome, was pleasant and 
well-executed. The repeating 
notes 
in 
the 
brass 
and 
woodwinds were impeccable, 
though slightly overpowering. 
The famed 16th-note passage 
in the basses (a quick scale-like 
passage on the lowest portion 
of the instrument where pitch 
is virtually indistinguishable) 
leapt from the orchestra with 
a muddy ferocity unparalleled 
in the entire work. It was, 
as 
Beethoven 
intended, 
a 
startling departure from the 
airy texture of the movement, 
a 
surprising 
hint 
at 
the 
frightening textures contained 
in some of Beethoven’s other 
orchestral works.
In the third movement, the 
orchestra struggled a bit to 
stay together before finding 
sure footing. The triplets in 
the cellos at the beginning of 
the movement began to fall 
apart, though this was quickly 
forgotten as the movement 

progressed. The fluxuations 
between loud and quiet sound 
easily captured the audience’s 
attention 
throughout 
the 
remainder of the work.
The 
last 
movement 
displayed similar faults and 
strengths in interpretation. 
While it was the least precise 
of the movements, it was also 
the 
most 
captivating. 
The 
various repeats of the melody 
within the movement managed 
to feel new and engaging at 
every instance. The sudden 
C-sharp modulation in the 
coda (ending section) was 
handled with the appropriate 
amount of surprise and then 
acceptance. All in all, it was 
a fitting end to Beethoven’s 
“Little Symphony in F” — 
his strangely sophisticated, 
comedic little work.

Strauss’s 
“Der 

Rosenkavalier 
Suite,” 
the 
second work on the program, 
also contained a few awkward 
moments 
in 
an 
otherwise 
eclectic and fun performance. 
The huge orchestra required 
for this piece led to some 
minor balance issues between 
strings and brass, though this 
was ironed out by the end of 
the piece. The cross-sectional 
doublings (those not confined 
to instruments within the 
woodwind, string or brass 
families) 
also 
struggled 
a 
bit 
throughout 
the 
work, 
though they seemed to gain in 
confidence as the performance 

progressed.
The octave passages in the 
bass and low brass, however, 
captured the audience and 
set the tone for the rest of the 
piece. These octave passages 
were resonant and powerful, 
seemingly 
waking 
up 
the 
orchestra and provoking an 
impressive performance.
Following 
these 
octaves, 
the solo passages began to 
emerge with confidence from 
the work. The oboe solos, for 
example, 
were 
impressive. 
The 
solo 
passage 
for 
the 
concertmaster, principal first 
violin, principal cello and oboe 
were absolutely awe-inspiring. 
This moment easily captured 
the performance, the trading of 
notes between the instruments 
beautifully 
navigated 
with 
grace and ease. This created 
a beautifully light and fragile 
texture 
in 
an 
otherwise 
overwhelmingly large work; 
a brief respite between vast 
complex sonorities.
The 
waltz 
sections 
in 
the second half of the work 
represented 
the 
entire 
orchestra at their best. The 
balance during these waltz 
sections was breathtaking — 
even the harp could be clearly 
heard when it was appropriate. 
The slower melodic passages 
also sounded incredibly rich 
and poignant. The constant 
fluctuation 
between 
slow 
melodic content and waltz 
sections gave the ending a 
confidence and radiance not 
felt through the early portion 
of the work.
The best moment, however, 
came midway through the end 
of the work. In preparation 
for an unexpectedly low bass 
note, conductor Oriol Sans 
pointed straight down while 
facing towards the section, 
a powerful look on his face. 
The 
basses 
responded 
to 
this gesture, delivering an 
appropriately ferocious drop 
in register. The smiles on the 
musicians’ faces as they played 
this low note represented the 
feeling of the entire concert: 
a 
confident 
interpretation 
of two lighter pieces in the 
orchestral repertoire. While it 
may be easy to take issue with 
some minor interpretational 
inconsistencies 
in 
the 
performance, it is impossible 
to deny that the orchestra 
delivered 
an 
intense, 
captivating concert.

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Sophomore goaltender Hayden Lavigne has been a human brick wall for Michigan, and the rest of the Wolverines’ defense has improved as well by cutting down on turnovers and playing faster.

Michigan defense appears to be coming back to life with recent success

When the Wolverines skated 

off the ice at Munn Ice Arena 
on Dec. 8 after suffering a 
crippling 5-0 loss at the hands 
of a Spartan offense that took 
advantage 
of 
the 
dormant 

Michigan defense, the story 
read that the early spark had 
faded.

The No. 20 Wolverines (7-7-2 

Big Ten, 12-10-2 overall) flipped 
the script this weekend, though, 
as 
a 
palpable 
and 
evident 

streamline from the back line to 
the front defined a series sweep 
over No. 12 Penn State (6-7-3, 
13-10-3).

While most of the credit 

for Michigan’s successes thus 
far has been attributed to the 

likes of senior forward Tony 
Calderone and the rest of the 
first two offensive lines, series 
sweeps over No. 13 Minnesota 
and then the Nittany Lions this 
past weekend were the product 
of a stalwart defensive effort.

“You need that in this day 

and age and the way the game 
is,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson after Friday’s victory. 
“You need your defensemen 
to come up in the play and add 
offense, but most importantly, 
they did a good job in our zone.”

Earlier 
in 
the 
season 
– 

particularly in the first matchup 
splits 
against 
the 
Golden 

Gophers and Penn State – the 
Michigan defense could be seen 
turning the puck over behind its 
own net, in the offensive zone 
and most notably at its own blue 

line.

Before, junior Nick Boka 

and sophomores Giffin Luce 
and Luke Martin represented 
the second and third lines of 
defensemen that 
weren’t playing 
up 
to 
their 

potential.

Even 
first-

liners in junior 
Joe Cecconi and 
freshman Quinn 
Hughes – albeit 
Hughes 
plays 

as an attacking 
defenseman 
– 

could 
be 
seen 

giving up the puck on routine 
plays.

But, something clicked after 

the Wolverines were swept in 
a home-and-home series two 

weeks ago against top-ranked 
Notre Dame.

“I think one of the things 

we’re really doing is breaking 
the puck out so much better 

than 
we 
were 

earlier 
in 
the 

year,” 
Pearson 

said. 
“That 

makes it easier. 
You’re 
not 
in 

your 
zone 
as 

much and you’re 
forcing 
their 

good 
players 

to play in their 
zone.”

Perhaps 
the 

greatest sign of a defensive 
turnaround came at the hands of 
a human brick wall: sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne.

Now the undeniable leader of 

the Wolverines’ defensive effort, 
Lavigne’s 77 saves this weekend 
saw him leaping all over the 
crease to limit the Nittany Lions 
to two goals, solely in the third 
period Saturday. His effort 
gave Michigan the backbone it 
needed.

And the rest of the defense 

followed suit.

“We’ve been communicating 

a lot better,” Lavigne said. 
“People know their routes a 
little bit better now than we did 
at the beginning of the year.

“We 
really 
just 
started 

paying the price for each other, 
we’ve got guys going down to 
block shots at the last minute … 
they’re just working hard.”

Luce, despite his double-

penalty game Saturday, flew 
around the ice with textbook 

coordination 
alongside 
his 

defensive 
partner 
Boka, 

carrying the puck around their 
net and checking any Nittany 
Lion offense.

“They’ve been really good,” 

Pearson said. “And I think that’s 
why you’re seeing some of the 
results that you’ve seen from 
our team … Luke Martin, Nick 
Boka, Griffin Luce – we sat him 
two games and he’s bounced 
back and played fabulous – 
they’ve come out and they’re 
pushing to the next level and 
you’re seeing that from a lot of 
our players.”

Penn State forwards Andrew 

Sturtz, Brandon Biro and Denis 
Smirnov, who were deadly the 
last time the two teams met, 
were silent. A shutout Friday 
that continued through two 
periods of Saturday’s game 
proved that the Wolverines’ 
back line had life again.

Blocked shots, aggressiveness 

on the boards and a lack of 
turnovers from the blue-liners 
was just the first stop on the 
defense’s train to dominance 
over these past two weeks. The 
forwards were getting involved 
too.

Sophomore 
center 
Jake 

Slaker – who has been fairly 
silent on the stat sheet – was 
diving in front of shots from the 
Penn State back line.

Senior 
left 
wing 
Dexter 

Dancs skated furiously back 
to the blue line to pressure 
Sturtz and company, providing 
support for a total-team defense 
that seemed to have an answer 
for anything the Nittany Lions 
threw at it.

At the beginning of the 

season, Pearson wanted to see a 
high-paced team committed to 
a speedy counterattack.

After this weekend, it appears 

that goal is coming to fruition. 

With yet another Big Ten 

series sweep over the Nittany 
Lions, 
the 
team’s 
recent 

successes — especially on the 
defensive end — may be more 
than just a temporary streak.

“We really just 
started paying 
the price for 
each other.”

“Meat Factory” dominates for ‘M’

Despite 
dropping its final 

relay race on Saturday afternoon, 
Michigan and its fans were able 
to find one positive in the form 
of a unit that is hard to miss, both 
in their impact and physically 
imposing size. 

The 
“Meat 
Factory,” 
a 

nickname affectionately given to 
the track and field team’s weight 
throwing competitors, notched 
the field’s top two positions.

Junior Joseph Ellis helped to 

pace the Wolverines, finishing 
with 
the 
furthest 
distance 

amongst the field on five of his 
six attempts, including one that 
traveled 22.55 meters to set a 
personal record and notch the 
longest shot recorded in the Big 
Ten this season.

“That’s 
a 
huge 
confidence 

booster,” Ellis said when informed 
his shot was a personal best.

Ellis’ teammate, senior Grant 

Cartwright, also had a big day, 
finishing in second place — just 
behind Ellis — to help earn a 
whopping 16 points towards their 
overall team score. When asked 
about Cartwright, Ellis spoke 
glowingly about his teammate.

 “Grant’s been a phenomenal 

teammate and a phenomenal 
competitor,” Ellis said. “It means 

a lot to have a great competitor in 
him and get to train with him all 
the time.” 

Michigan coach Jerry Clayton 

spoke highly of his weight-
throwing team after their meet 
had concluded.

“They’re the nucleus of what 

we’re looking at in terms of the 
national level,” Clayton said.

It’s easy to 

see why Clayton 
made 
such 
a 

statement. 
The 

“Meat Factory” 
absolutely 
demolished their 
competition on 
Saturday, 
with 

both Ellis and 
Cartwright 
having 
tosses 

over 22 meters. 
They were also able to earn the 
maximum total of 16 points 
for the event, which featured 
Arkansas, Michigan State, and 
Ohio State.

“It’s a great opportunity to put 

yourself up against two other Big 
Ten schools,” Ellis said.

Ellis noted the team’s ability to 

earn a win the way that they were 
able to today is “huge” for the 
unit’s confidence.

The Wolverine faithful helped 

to create a fantastic turnout 
to support the track and field 

department’s 
various 
teams, 

with over 2,000 fans packing the 
newly-opened U-M Indoor Track 
Building to watch the meet. 

“It was actually quite nerve-

wracking,” Ellis said as he 
glanced up at the stands. “Some 
of my throws were off to the side 
when I was warming up (because 
I was so nervous).” 

Yet, 
Ellis 

and the rest of 
the 
throwers 

still 
managed 

to perform. For 
that 
reason, 

the 
Wolverines 

know they can 
depend 
on 
the 

“Meat 
Factory,” 

expectations that 
Ellis says he feels.

“The 
team’s 

expecting a lot of us, but we expect 
a lot of ourselves,” Ellis said. They 
clearly met Clayton’s expectations 
as well.

Added Clayton: “The marks 

at which they opened at were 
exactly 
at 
where 
we 
were 

expecting”

This win is a huge one for 

the Wolverines, and fans can 
only hope that the dominance 
of the “Meat Factory” can carry 
over to the rest of the team and 
ultimately lead to a successful 
2018 campaign.

Wolverines finish weekend at 2-0

The Michigan men’s tennis 

team did its due diligence on the 
West Coast this past weekend, 
starting the season 2-0 with 
wins at Washington and Boise 
State. Entering the spring season 
ranked No. 17, the Wolverines 
survived an immediate scare 
in Seattle on Saturday before 
sweeping 
Boise 

State, 
7-0, 
on 

Monday.

Initially, 
it 

seemed 
as 
if 

Michigan started 
the 
season 
off 

on 
the 
wrong 

foot, losing the 
doubles point to 
Washington.

“We 
have 

to get better at 
doubles. We have to find a lineup 
that’ll work, and also execute 
and play better,” said Michigan 
coach Adam Steinberg.

However, the nation’s No. 

9 singles player, senior Alex 
Knight, began a rally for the 
Wolverines singles squad with 
a 6-2, 6-2 win against Mitch 
Stewart. 

“It’s 
really 
important, 

especially after you lose the 
doubles point, to get one of the 

six guys off the court quick with 
a decisive win,” Knight said. “It 
really gives your teammates a 
little bit of confidence. We’re 
no longer losing in this match, 
we’re 
still 
in 
this. 
We’re 

fighting.”

Soon after, freshman Mattias 

Siimar earned a tough 6-3, 6-3 
win at the No. 3 singles position, 
giving Michigan a 2-1 lead.

“I thought that was probably 

the 
most 

important 
match 
of 
the 

day,” Steinberg 
said. 
“We’ve 

seen him all fall 
and he is a really 
good 
player, 

but 
his 
first 

college 
match 

is different. It’s 
very hard to get 
used to and he 

did a great job. He beat a good 
player in straight sets and that 
gave the team a lot of confidence 
for sure. I haven’t asked all of 
them, but I know it meant a lot.”

To close out the match, junior 

Myles Schalet and senior Carter 
Lin squeezed out tight matches, 
winning 6-4, 6-4, and 6-4, 
7-5, respectively, earning the 
Wolverines the decisive points 
of the match.

Two days later, Michigan 

dominated Boise State with 
relative ease, with no player 
giving up more than three games 
in a single set or five games in a 
full match. 

“The guys really took care 

of business on every court. We 
were consistent all the way 
through,” Steinberg said. “We 
have a big weekend coming up, 
so it was good to get off the 
courts quicker for sure.”

A big weekend indeed, as the 

Wolverines will travel to North 
Carolina, ironically, to kick off 
the ITA Regionals against No. 
20 South Carolina. With the 
season young, Michigan hopes 
to add an early, strong win to 
their resume.

But that doesn’t need to be 

told to this squad.

“It’s big (to have momentum),” 

Knight said. “We got a really 
tough opponent next week. 
They’re also top-20, so it’s really 
important that we got two wins 
this weekend.”

Though the season is just 

beginning, 
the 
Wolverines 

have aspirations for Big Ten 
and National championships, 
and every player, especially 
the seniors, knows that it all 
starts next weekend at the ITA 
Regionals. For now though, this 
weekend was a good first step 
toward that.

‘M’ struggles but wins

Even though the team managed 

to pull out a win, the No. 3 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team (2-0 Big Ten, 3-0 overall) 
feel some disappointment in their 
performance.

The Wolverines took on its first 

road meet of the season versus No. 
21 Illinois on Saturday. With a final 
score of 194.975-194.325, Michigan 
won by a narrow margin.

But it wasn’t only the final scores 

that were close. The Wolverines 
lost vault by 0.15 points, won 
bars by 1.475 points, lost beam by 
0.1 points and lost floor by 0.575 
points.

“It wasn’t what we are capable 

of,” said junior Emma McLean. 
“We have more control than we 
used today.”

Added Michigan coach Bev 

Plocki: “We couldn’t find a landing 
to save our lives.”

Plocki did, however, praise 

the 
performances 
of 
senior 

Briana Brown and freshman Syd 
Townsend, calling Townsend’s bar 
routine “flawless.” Brown received 
a 9.825 for her floor routine.

When asked if being away from 

home for the first time this season 
changed the team’s dynamic, 
McLean said she felt that being 
on the road did slightly affect the 
team.

“(We have to) be able to bring 

the same level of energy and 
confidence that we have at home 
with us on the road,” Plocki said.

Top performers in Saturday’s 

meet include senior Paige Zaziksi 
with a winning 9.900 on the uneven 
bars. McLean also impressed with 
a 9.875 floor — which also brought 
her a win — and sophomore Polina 
Shchennikova with a 9.850 beam 
debut.

Shchennikova’s 
last-minute 

addition to the beam routine as 
the anchor was one of the meet’s 
most remarkable moments for the 
Wolverines.

“(Shchennikova) was ready to 

go,” McLean said. “We couldn’t 
ask more from her.”

While the outcome of the meet 

was favorable for the Wolverines, 
many mistakes were made. Still, 
as McLean put it, the result will 
allow the Wolverines to continue 
“building on what we’ve created 
so far.”

“Overall I’m still super proud of 

every single person on this team,” 
McLean said. “We fought like no 
other, it wouldn’t have turned 
out how it did if we didn’t keep 
fighting.”

Michigan’s next meet will 

again be on the road as it travels to 
Nebraska. By then, the Wolverines 
will hope to have found a way to 
correct the mistakes they made in 
Champaign.

No. 2 Michigan defeats 
Ohio State on the road

Before Vanessa Krause dove 

into the pool at Ohio State’s 
McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion, the 
sophomore made sure to take a 
sharp look at everything around 
her: the locks, the pads, even the 
scarlet and gray-clad stands.

It’s important for Krause and 

the No. 2 Michigan women’s 
swim team to get familiar with 
this setting. Its wins over Ohio 
State (176-124), Virginia Tech 
(224-76) and Rutgers (233-67) 
were just one of three potential 
meets in the Buckeyes’ home 
pool.

Those 
other 
two 
meets? 

None other than the Big Ten 
Championships and the NCAA 
Championships.

“It was pretty 

interesting 
to 

see the pool and 
the nice facility 
that they have,” 
Krause 
said. 

“Unfortunately, 
it was all red 
instead 
of 

maize 
and 

blue, but it was 
a really good 
experience with 
the team. … It was a good start to 
the season, swimming in their 
pool, checking out everything.”

That 
extra 
look 
around 

seemed to benefit Krause in her 
first meet there this season too, 
as she came out as one of three 
double winners on the team 
along with senior Clara Smiddy 
and junior Rose Bi. Krause noted 
that it was important to change 
her energy strategy to win the 
100 and 200-yard butterfly.

“They all told me ‘You really 

like to back-half your races and 
you really like to sit on everyone 
until the very end,’ ” Krause said. 
“I guess that’s when they say I 
like to come back and finish.

“Today, we really tried to 

focus on taking it out in the 
beginning and not being afraid 
of dying down at the end. 
That’s 
something 
that 
I’ve 

really struggled with, but also 
something I’ve really pushed 
myself to be better at.”

While the Wolverines were 

adjusting to the hostile Ohio 
State environment, they also 
became 
familiar 
with 
the 

prospect of swimming without 
the constant presence of star 
junior Siobhan Haughey.

Although Haughey returned 

to action after missing last 
week’s 
dual 
meet 
against 

Indiana, she only swam the 
200-yard freestyle. Michigan 
coach Mike Bottom was pleased 
with the team’s performance 
in 
her 
quasi-absence, 
but 

was noncommittal to stating 
that Haughey would be fully 
available 
for 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Championships and the NCAAs.

“I hope so,” 

Bottom said. “I 
hope so.”

Contrary 

to 
the 
sport 

of 
swimming 

itself, the road 
to 
success 
is 

not 
always 

straightforward. 
Injuries 
like 

Haughey’s 
are 
almost 

inevitable. The team spent three 
months 
without 
swimming 

at home. Time will tell what 
other twists and turns will be 
thrown the Wolverines’ way, but 
in the moment, they’re staying 
confident.

“It definitely has boosted 

my confidence,” Krause said. 
“Knowing where I’m going to 
swim and knowing what the 
pool is like, helps me initialize 
and look forward to better 
things in the future hopefully. 
I’ll know what the pool looks 
like, where we are sitting for 
Big Tens, how long it’ll take us 
to get there from the hotel. It’s 
just really good mentally for me 
to know those things.”

If they can hold on to the 

familiar, as Krause started to 
do this weekend, anything is 
possible.

WOMEN’S SWIMMING AND DIVING

“It’s just really 
good mentally 
for me to know 
those things.”

Robinson gets his break amidst trying month

January hasn’t been easy for 

Duncan Robinson.

Just take last Thursday, when 

the fifth-year senior forward 
went scoreless against Nebraska 
— his first time pointless since his 
debut for the Michigan basketball 
team.

The 
0-for-2 
effort 
was 

representative of a career-worst 
season 
for 
Robinson, 
who’s 

shooting 37 percent beyond the 
arc. At times, a once dependable 
outside 
stroke 
has 
looked 

anything but.

That has caused a major shift 

for Robinson and the Wolverines. 
After 
a 
series 
of 
breakout 

performances, freshman forward 
Isaiah Livers took Robinson’s spot 
in the starting lineup.

Robinson, 
meanwhile, 
is 

playing fewer minutes than ever 
coming off the bench.

“The past 21 days have been 

a whirlwind,” Robinson said 
Sunday.

It’s the type of month that 

could have challenged Robinson’s 
relationship with coach John 
Beilein.

In 2014, the New Hampshire 

native left Williams College after 
one year for the chance to play 
Division I basketball in Beilein’s 
3-point-minded 
offense. 
The 

two clicked and in his first year 
of eligibility, Robinson averaged 
nearly four 3-pointers and 11 
points per game as a reserve. 

Last year, Robinson returned 

for his first shot at a starting job. 
But with size and athletic ability 
that Robinson couldn’t match, 
D.J. Wilson won the competition 
and much more, playing his way 
to a first-round selection in the 
2017 NBA Draft. Conversely, 
Robinson saw his usage drop by 
roughly eight minutes per game.

But this season seemingly 

provided Robinson with a fresh 
slate paired with junior center 
Mortiz Wagner in the front court. 
Robinson was effective early on, 
averaging 13 points in Michigan’s 

first seven contests.

Things 
began 
to 
change, 

however, in Michigan’s first game 
of the calendar year. Livers, the 
young reserve in waiting, scored 
13 points in 27 minutes in a win 
at Iowa. Robinson played just 13 
minutes and scored a mere five 
points.

That extrapolated over the 

next two weeks 
— Livers was a 
budding 
star, 

Robinson 
was 

lackluster 
— 

giving 
Beilein 

a 
predicament. 

It’s not often a 
fifth-year senior 
is benched for 
a player a half-
decade younger.

Still, 
Beilein 

chose the latter.

“It was a conversation between 

coach and I,” Robinson said. “A 
lot of it will stay between him and 
I, but I kind of looked at is as a 
leadership moment to earn some 
credibility in that regard.”

Leadership 
was 
about 
all 

Robinson was good for in his 
immediate return to the bench. 
Last week, he made just three 
field goals in as many games.

But Sunday was different.

Robinson first awoke to a text 

from his coach, reaffirming his 
ability with a bit of advice.

“I sent him a quick text today,” 

Beilein said. “‘Duncan, you’re 
gonna be terrific today. Just come 
off shooting.’”

Hours later, Robinson did 

just that and more in a win over 
Rutgers: 12 points, five assists, 

four rebounds and 
three steals.

“I just tried to 

be 
aggressive,” 

Robinson 
said. 

“In that role, I 
just try to come 
off and provide a 
spark. Offensively, 
I made some shots 
and defensively, I 
sat down.”

Added Beilein: 

“Duncan Robinson — it was what 
we needed today from him. He’s 
probably more rested than some 
of our guys, and when he made 
(his first) three when Isaiah was 
in foul trouble, it was a sign to play 
him more.”

Robinson took advantage of the 

extra opportunity, taking shots 
that he passed on in prior games. 
Midway through the first half, 
even with a defender draped over 
him, Robinson pulled the trigger 

and sank the Wolverines’ final 
go-ahead 3-pointer.

It was the sort of play that 

might earn others a trip to the 
bench. 

But Robinson has been through 

thick and thin with Beilein over 
the past four years. Now, despite 
some hesitation, Robinson can 
take more chances.

“What we see (from Robinson) 

in practice in his drills is 
phenomenal,” Beilein said. “But 
when we go into practice sessions, 
he’s asking for permission. He 
doesn’t need permission, I trust 
him.”

No matter the minutes or 

starting designation, Michigan 
needs Robinson to leverage that 
trust. When on, his shooting 
stroke can be dangerous. Rutgers 
coach 
Steve 
Pikiell 
credited 

Robinson’s triples as a momentum 
killer Sunday. 

But their significance is far 

greater. Finally, in the midst of a 
testing month, Robinson got his 
break.

“That’s the dude I know,” 

Wagner 
said. 
“That’s 
my 

roommate. That’s the player I’ve 
played with the last three years, 
so I’m not surprised at all. I’m 
very proud of him the way he 
bounces back.”

Sixteenth-ranked Wolverines look to stay hot

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has been hot 
recently.

After upsetting then-No. 8 Ohio 

State in Columbus last week, the 
Wolverines returned home and 
pounded Illinois, 86-42, Saturday 
night. 
Against 
the 
Fighting 

Illini, Michigan was firing on 
all cylinders. The offense was 
energized, led by senior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty who tallied 
27 points and averages 23.1 per 
contest. Freshman forward Hailey 
Brown also shined, finishing with 
17 points and 14 rebounds for her 
third career double-double.

On Tuesday, Michigan State 

(4-3 Big Ten, 14-6 overall) looks 
to dethrone the sixteenth-ranked 
Wolverines (6-2, 17-4) at Crisler 
Center.

The 
Spartans 
return 
four 

starters 
from 
a 
2017 
squad 

that qualified for the NCAA 
Tournament and finished 21-12. 

This season, though, they have 
not had the same success, in part 
because 
last 
season’s 
leading 

scorer, Tori Jankoska, graduated. 
Jankoska 
scored 
28 
and 
14 

points in her two matchups with 
Michigan last season, respectively.

Due to injuries, Michigan State 

has had eight different starting 
lineups already. The Spartans 
currently stand at eighth in the 
Big Ten, and are coming off a 
69-65 loss against a below-average 
Indiana team.

Regardless of Michigan State’s 

record, the matchup is a rivalry 
game, and the Wolverines are well 
aware that anything can happen.

“They’re 
always 
tough,” 

Flaherty 
said 
after 
defeating 

Illinois. “No matter if they’re 
the best in the league, last in the 
league they always come out, 
they’re ready, they scout us. They 
have a great game plan against us 
every single year.”

The Spartans’ offense has had 

some 
signature 
performances 

this year. The team has reached 

triple digits twice this season and 
averages 71.1 points per game. 
Guards Shay Colley and Branndais 
Agee, as well as center Jenna 
Allen lead the pack, averaging 
11.5, 10.9 and 10.1 points per game, 
respectively.

But Michigan State’s offense 

will be tested Tuesday. Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico’s team 
has 
found 
defensive 
success 

throughout the season, and held 
the Fighting Illini to just four 
points in the third quarter of the 
last contest.

Due 
to 
some 
offensive 

struggles, Michigan has had to 
rely on its defense in the past. 
The Wolverines average 16.5 
turnovers per game and often 
have trouble settling in. Although 
the offense has been improving, it 
will need to value each possession 
against the Spartans. Brown has 
been making strides — shooting 
at least 50 percent from the field 
in her last six games — so her 
contributions will be essential to 
the team.

Though 
Michigan 
appears 

to have the upper hand, history 
indicates 
otherwise. 
The 

Wolverines 
have 
only 
won 

three of the 14 meetings against 
Michigan State and lost both 
matchups last season. The first 
of those losses was their sole 
home loss of the season, while the 
second eliminated them from the 
Big Ten tournament during the 
first round. Those two defeats 
were part of a bad final stretch 
that left Michigan out of the 
NCAA Tournament.

“It’s been tough the past couple 

years for us,” Flaherty said.

The 
Wolverines 
look 
to 

continue 
building 
momentum, 

but it wouldn’t be a surprise if 
the Spartans cause troubles once 
again. The stakes will be high, 
that’s for sure.

“They come in every single 

year 
ready 
to 
go,” 
Flaherty 

said. “It seems like a national 
championship every single time 
we play them, just cause you really 
wanna win that game.”
