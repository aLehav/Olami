Open Housing
Initiative works
with 'U' to create
new program
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
Almost four years after LSA
senior Amy Navvab successfully
pushed the Open Housing Ini-
tiative, University Housing has
announced plans to start a gen-
der-inclusive living community in
East Quad Residence Hall for the
fall 2013 semester.
The Gender Inclusive Living.
Experience will allow students
who identity as transgender, gen-
der non-conforming or as allies to
choose a roommate of any gender
and live with a community of like-
minded individuals.
University Housing spokesman
Peter Logan said Housing would

reserve 12 beds for the communi-
ty next fall and would work with
the Spectrum Center to review
applications to live in GILE.
Navvab, chairwoman of the
Open Housing Initiative, said she
became involved when she real-
ized that studdnts who did not
identify with the gender binary
and who wanted alternative
housing options could only find
a comfortable living situation in
Northwood Housing.
"It was something that was
unjust," Navvab said.
After work with both the Open
Housing Initiative and the Spec-
trum Center Advocacy Board,
students submitted a petition to
University Housing to explore
more options for gender inclusive
housing in 2008.
Jackie Simpson, the direc-
tor of the Spectrum Center;said
the petition sparked a conversa-
tion between University Housing
and student groups like Central

Six-week program
encourages dorms

By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
After ' much anticipation,
the results of the 2012 Kill-a-
Watt competition have been
announced, and the students
of South Quad Residence Hall
came out on top.
Kill-a-Watt is a six-week

campus-wide effort to reduce
the amount of energy used in
residence halls. The University
has saved thousands of dollars
as a result of the energy con-
served through this competi-
tion, which began in' winter
2010.
LSA freshman Lania Robin-
son, a South Quad community
adviser, said members of the
residence staff sent out e-mails
and posted flyers to spread the
word and encourage students
to participate.
"I personally just tried to be

a little more conscious of the
energy that I used," Robinson
said. "I would unplug my lap-
top if it was fully charged and
turn off-my lights and my desk

TechArb startup creates new fuel injector

"'""""""""""-i

PicoSpray aims
to make small
engines more
eco-friendly
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
Two engineering students
have created a new method of
fuel injection to make small
engines more environmentally
friendly.
Engineering graduate
student Lihang Nong and
engineering alum Brett Merkel
began work on PicoSpray in the
University's TechArb startup
lab in November 2010.
The PicoSpray electronic
fuel injection device sprays
fuel mist into a small engine's
combustion chamber, a process
which ims to replace the more
traditional but less efficient
carburetor in most engines.
The team is targeting the

product for small engine
manufacturers. In the past,
the high cost of adding an
electronic fuel injection
system has dissuaded small
engine manufacturers from
includingthem in their already
costly engines.
However, , PicoSpray
advertises its ability to
decrease both an . engine's
emissions and cost by using
fewer parts than traditional
fuel injection devices. This
makes them easier to install
and saves about 70 percent of
the cost in mechanical parts,
Nong explained.
Even individual buyers are
becoming interested in fuel
injectors like PicoSpray to
better the longevity and overall
function of various small
engines.
Merkel, who also founded
the student-run Supermileage
team, which focuses on
"designing the most fuel-
efficient internal combustion

concept carin North America,"
was already interested in
energy efficient transportation
"that aligned with PicoSpray,"
he said.
Merkel joined Nong in
September 2011 for the Clean.
Energy Venture Challenge
that year. They also entered
their design in iStart's Clean
Energy Challenge 2012 aimed
at discovering and rewarding
clean energy business startups.
They made it to the final round
of the competition in February
2012 and won third place.
PicoSpray's page on the
iStart website points out that
small engines, such as those in
motorcycles, lawnmowers and
generators create much more
pollution worldwide than
large engines, such as those in
cars.
PicoSpray's creators are
confident that increased fuel
emission regulations, both in
the United States and abroad,
will lead to small engine

manufacturer's need for a more
efficient fuel injector option.
"New motorcycles produced
in countries such as Taiwan
and Thailand are already
mostly fuel injected," said
Nong.
A similar phenomenon took
place 20 years ago, when almost
all cars became fuel injected
over a 10-year period as a result
of increased fuel prices and
stricter government emission
standards.
The two intend to put
together a larger team to mass-
produce their product, but this
will take a greater amount of
time and money. Once this is
done, they expect to sell about
5,000 devices at $200 to $300
each in the first year.
Merkel graduated last April
and is now employed at Stryker,
a medical technology company.
Since then, PicoSpray has hired
two new full time workery,
and they're working on getting
their design patented.

U.S. Transportation Secre-

Reusable lunchboxes launch at'U'

Pilot program funded by
Coleman's sustainablity
pledge and goals
By ERIN FORSYTHE
Daily StaffReporter
It takes some out-of-the-box thinking
to reinvent the lunch box.
Now in its pilot phase, the Go Blue
Box is an reusable, eco-friendly food
container offered at the University Club
in the Michigan Union as an alterna-
tive to the ubiquitous white polystyrene
take-out box. The program was created
in November in an effort to reduce the
waste created by dining services.
The Go Blue Box requires users to
register for the program and pay a $5
refundable deposit for a clamshell con-
tainer. After diners are finished with
their Go Blue Box, they can return it for
their deposit or bring it back in exchange
for a clean one the next time they visit
the U-Club.
The box itself is much more durable
than the typical foam takeout box, last-
ing for about 360 uses. The Go Blue Box
is also BPA-free, dishwasher safe and
microwavable. A reusable soup contain-
er is also available for a $3 deposit.
The pilot program was funded by a
grant from the Planet Blue Student Inno-
vation Fund and is led by Rich Grousset,
Phel Meyer and Dave Yang, students of

the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable
Enterprise.
According to Meyer, similar programs
have been implemented at more than
200 universities across the country and
experienced a fair amount of success.
Meyer added that he was inspired by the
work done on the project and grateful for
the assistance the PBSIF grant has pro-
vided.
"(University President) Mary Sue
Coleman made a big announcement (in
2011) setting some pretty ambitious
sustainability goals and waste reduc-
tion was one of them," Meyer said. "We
thought this was a great opportunity to
do something that's been tried at many
other schools."
"We wanted to do something similar
but with a Michigan twist," he added.
The PBSIF has been a vital source for
many sustainability projects on campus,
including bike air pumps in different
locations across campus and a sustain-
able food kiosk pilot program that ran
last year in April. In 2011, Coleman
pledged $50,000 per year for three years
in order to promote projects that benefit
the environment and encourage student
involvement in sustainability projects.
Undergraduates interested in campus
sustainabilit.y also contributed to the
program alongside graduate students.
Through a course, "Sustainability and
the Campus", students prepared a mar-
keting campaign and designed operation
aspects of the Go Blue Box project.

Laura Seagram, the marketing and
communications specialist for the
Union, stressed the importance of the
course in assisting with sustainability
projects over the year. The class has also
contributed to the .implementation of
water bottle refill stations and to signage
for the University's single-stream recy-
cling program.
LSA junior Maria Kim said she had
done environmental work in Africa
through civil and environmental engi-
neering programs during summer 2012
and was interested in making a contri-
bution on campus through the project-
based environment course.
"It was definitely a learning experi-
ence of why it's important to keep things
sustainable," Kim said. "What kept me
going was wanting to see this happen
in reality, because it's definitely the
first one at our university, and it would
be awesome (to contribute to) because
Michigan is still moving toward becom-
ing a more sustainable and environmen-
tally friendly university."
LSA junior Aaron Handley, another
student in the course, said programs like
the Go Blue Box benefit the participating
restaurants themselves.
"All of the logistic analysis that has
been done on the containers we use
shows that there was much less of an
environment greenhouse footprint with
the washing as opposed to the dispos-
able Styrofoam containers that most
people used," Handley said. "Something

like this is cost saving and reduces the
amount of waste each establishment
produces."
LSA sophomore Jason Liu hopes the
Go Blue Box would become the standard
take-out container, not just a unique
innovation.
"We looked at alot of different schools,
(but) the University of Vermont was one
of them that we looked at more specifi-
cally," Liu said. Some of their programs
had incentives for using it, so (patrons)
got five or 10 cents back every time they
used the containers."
Currently, the Go Blue Box is only
available at the University Club in the
Union, but creators are hopeful that use
will spread to other vendors on campus
and generate interest from students.
"The University Club wants students
to come, and they're trying to advertise
more to students that there's great din-
ing options'available," Handley said.
"And they take Blue Bucks, alot of people
don't realize that."
Meyer added that he is hopeful for
the development of the Go Blue Box and
feels the positive responses they have
received are promising for the program's
future.
"Ultimately nobody likes creating
waste necessarily, it just happens to be
easier to take a disposable container
back to your office and throw it away,"
Meyer said. "I think people really appre-
ciate having an easy way to improve
their behavior."

An ongoing archeological dig in Sudan
conducted by a University researcher
may unearth discoveries about an ancient
Nubian city.
Geoff Emberling, a research scientist
at the University's Museum of Archeol-
ogy, began the excavation on Jan. 2 and is
workingwith several Sudanese professors.
They are looking to find traces of settle-
ments in El-Kurru, a 3,000 year-old politi-
cal center in the African kingdom of Kush.
Derek Peterson, professor of History
and Afro-American and African Studies,
said researching Kush settlements may
transform the way scholars approach Afri-
can history. Historically, scholars have
struggled to connect ancient Egyptian
civilization to the rest of Africa.
"In the study of Kush we can begin to
understand the routes by which ideas,
commodities, symbols and people moved
from north to south and back again, draw-
ing Egypt into a close relationship with the
rest of ancient Africa," Peterson said.
El-Kurru's pyramids and burial grounds
were excavated inthe early2oth centuryby

American archaeologist George Reisner.
Emberling said Reisner's notes indicate
that structures, including a 200 meter-
long wall, a rock-cut well and two temples,
did exist, though Reisner did not excavate
them. The structures are invisible today,
likely due to unusually high flooding ofthe
Nile River during the 1980s.
Emberling's fieldwork is sponsored by
the National Geographic Society and Kath-
leen Picken, a private donor from Chicago.
National Geographic requires Ember-
lingto maintain ablogabout his dig, detail-
ing his ongoing discoveries and daily life.
Emberling has made five trips to
Sudan, beginning in 2007 after a dam was
planned to be built in the Nile that would
have flooded 100 miles of the river valley.
If archeologists hadn't intervened, Suda-
nese artifacts would have been lost.
"It was an international effort," Ember-
ling said. "You would think that there are
no foreigners here, but it's actually a boom
time to archaeology in Sudan."
Thankfully, the Sudanese government
is allowing archaeologists to bring back
objects they discover.
"It's rare to have material to look at and
bringback," Emberling said. "They're enti-
tIed to keep everything. Sudan has been
very generous in that way."
Due to a 20-year-old international sanc-
tion, Emberling was required to appeal to
the U.S. government for his projects, prov-
ing his reasons to work in Sudan were not'

related to terrorism. Emberling said he
didn't hear back from the U.S. Depart-
ments of State, Treasury and Commerce
for over a year.
He noted that he also had some difficul-
ties oftraveling around Sudan.
"Sudan's infrastructure of roads are only
very recently up to modern standards,"
Emberlingsaid. "Just in the five years since
I first came to Sudan they've completed
bridges and roads."
New archaeology technologies in Sudan
parallel its infrastructure. Subsurface
methods like magnetometry, which records
variations in the magnetic field resulting
from objects up to15 feet underground, are
new in Sudan, despite their prevalence else-
where.
"Some of the satellite image analysis is
quite sophisticated," Emberling said. "But
other parts of our toolkit are really old
school: shovels and wheelbarrows, paper
and pencil, and tape measure and ruler.
At some point we might be all-digital, but
we're not there yet."
Another tool is as "old school" as it gets:
tales from the townspeople. Emberling said
though they may seem farfetched, the sto-
ries sometimes point to new discoveries.
Tradition and technology work in
tandem in Emberling's fieldwork. A resi-
dent pointed out to Emberling where he
thought the city wall and the royal bath
might be. A magnetometry survey con-
ducted by Emberling's colleague, Salah

el Din Mohammed, confirmed there was
in fact an ancient building in the location
where villagers recalled the royal bath's
location.
Emberling noted the peculiarity of try-
ing to discover an ancient city in a still-
inhabited village like El-Kurru.
"It's funny digging in a living village. I
spent the day digging through a modern
garbage pit through razor blades, plastic
bags, batteries," Emberling said. "It wasn't
pleasantbut it had to be done."
Emberling said he will return to Ann
Arbor by the end of February after the six-
week diggingseason. If his fieldwork yields
results, he will plan for a trip next year to
investigate findings morethoroughly.
"For me to have agood season - and it's
looking pretty good - I would have to locate
several ofthese monumental remains, and I
would have to dig all the way to the bottom
ofthem, so I'll know what I'mup against for
next year," Emberling said.
. Historians, too, are eager to see what
Emberling and the 30-some other arche-
ologists laboring in Sudan will find. Find-
ings of Kush culture proposes that ancient
Africa is more complex than previously
imagined.
"Thanks to the work of archaeologists
like Dr. Emberling, we're learning that
the story is actually much more compli-
cated," Peterson said. "Kush's culture,
religion and politics were not simply
derived from Egypt."

Blurry vision
Snyder needs to be more concrete in 2013
D espite his claims of being a political outsider, Michigan Gov.
Rick Snyder's State of the State address delivered more of the
same watered-down rhetoric. In his hour-long speech, Sny-
der focused on the state's accomplishments in the past year, empha-
sizing Michigan's now-stabilized economy. However, rather than
outlining a definitive vision for the state's future, the governor spoke
in generalities. Michigan is at a crossroads in its recovery, and Snyder
missed the opportunity to discuss several key issues that will signifi-
cantly affect the state's economy. In 2013, Snyder needs to provide the
public with specific plans rather than the vague goals he outlined in
his address.

ike a lot of families who
don't know what to do on
Christmas Day, mine went
to see a movie.
Somewhere
between a trailer
for "Pain and
Gain" and "Djan-
go Unchained," an
army recruitment ,
advertisement
filled the screen. EMILY
This wasn't like PITTINOS
many of the
advertisements on TV: It wasn't
a son informing his dad of the
army's tuition benefits over a game
of backyard basketball or a weepy
mother gushing about the pride she
feels for her golden boy. This ad
was unusual to me because it only
featured women.
Oneshotshowed awomaninbattle
fatigues running through dry terrain
before diving into a whirring heli-
copter. Another woman bore glinting
Medals of Honor as she paced before
a lecture hall packed with men in
uniform. A female doctor stitched up
soldiers in adusty medical tent while
triumphant music blared through
the theater's surround sound. Each
woman was powerful, satisfied and
in charge.
Whenthe commercial was over,
my aunt, a decidedly anti-warliberal,
leaned toward me between bites of
unbuttered popcorn and whispered,
"Wow, that was a really good ad."
And it was.
Itsgrand shots made me marvel at
the strength of female soldiers and
women in general. Not too long ago,
girls could hardly dream of being
physicians, let alone receive medical
training on the government's dime.
Here, however, was an advertise-
ment promising exactly that.
I already knew enlisting has its
benefits. I live with a girl whose dad
has helped build their family's life
with his career in the military. I've
also known troubled kids who have
bettered themselves immeasurably
from the army's structure. But these
military women radiated with a new

sense of possibility.
For a moment, I felt like the
advertisement was administer-
ing an injection of hope to its cho-
sen audience. Movie trailers and
commercials are targeted to spe-
cific areas, and it's no accident that
this ad was being shown in Benzie
County, one of the poorer parts of
Michigan. Growing up, I com-
monly heard about guys enlisting
in the military for steady employ-
ment and the hopes of affording a
college education. And while I was
applying to schools, many girls my
age were taking full-time jobs at the
local Best Western and Papa John's
to help their families pay the bills. It
probably didn't occur to them that
they could do what the boys were
doing, and I liked the idea of women
around me realizingtheir options.
However, my pride receded once
I realized the advertisement wasn't
givinghope to Benzie county girls as
much as it was manipulating them
with vivid shots of these bold beau-
ties at war.
If you ask any feminist if women
should fight in wars alongside men,
the answer would probably be a ten-
tative "yes." It's a common under-
standing in the interest of progress
that women must populate every
field that men do, from urology to
presidency, and that includes being
respected as soldiers and officers.
But in an effort to recruit from a
relatively untapped source of warm
bodies, this advertisement used
feminist ideals to its advantage by
exploiting the rare successes of
women in the field.
It also left out the harsh truth:
War is a practice that has histori-
cally included women in its car-
nage. Its history is full of civilian
girls taken as war brides and sex
slaves. While focused on shots of
women striking punching bags
"Million Dollar Baby"-style, the
advertisement failed to mention
that it's even less safe for women
to be on an invading team than the
average male at war. Women can be
war heroes, but they also risk facing.

sex-specific dangers that male sol-
diers are less likely to experience.
Last year, Ms. Magazine's blog
published an article about "The
Invisible War," a documentary about
sexual assault overseas. The arti-
cle says that there have been some
reports of male rape victims, but
the number is nowhere close to the
Department of Defense's estimate
"that during 2010, as many as 19,000
women were raped in the military."
Even worse, many of those sur-

vivors did not receive the physi-
cal and psychological treatment
they needed after coming forward
about their trauma. According to
CNN, victims have said the mili-
tary's "conflicted chain of com-
mand structure did not protect
them from avoidable harm or sup-
port their need for justice." In other
words, if the rapist was a superior
officer, the event was often negated
or ignored, making the victims feel
crazy rather than comforted.
Though awareness of these
issues is increasing, it'll take a
lot of change for the military to
become a truly safe environment
for female soldiers. However, if
a friend of mine told me she was
thinking about signing up in order
to gain education or a career, I
wouldn't try to stop her. I'd only
implore her to seek out female vet-
erans and ask them about the story
behind the glory displayed in ads
like the one I saw. Women need to
know that they could face special
dangers that go beyond bombs and
night terrors before they decide
to ship off for basic training.

In his speech, Snyder introduced "the new
big three" - the auto industry, agriculture
and tourism. This departure from the tradi-
tional automotive Big Three - General Motors,
Ford and Chrysler - highlights a nuanced
understanding of Michigan's economy, with-
out leaving the automotive companies behind.
Specifically, Snyder's emphasis on tourism
through the expansion of the Pure Michigan
brand proves the governor is paying attention
to agrowing, sustainable industry.Accordingto
Snyder, revenues from Michigan tourism grew
by $500 million ip the last year alone, while
hotel room occupancy and rates continue to
rise. The governor also stressed improvements
in outdoor facilities and parks, mentioning
the development of water recreation in Grand
Rapids. Focusing on tourism has not only been
effective in bringing new people to Michigan,
but in recapturing residents' pride in their
home state and promoting between residents.
Snyder spent a great deal of his speech
emphasizing the rebuilding of Michigan's
crumbling infrastructure, proposing more
than $1 billion in new funding for repair proj-
ects. As necessary as it is to rebuild the state's
notoriously broken highways and roads, Sny-
der ignored the real issue Michiganders are
craving action on: public transportation. The
governor's address briefly mentioned the
Regional Transit Authority and ta new head,

DTE executive Paul Hillegonds, but he failed
to specifically discuss the state's ailing need
for expanded public transit. The concept of
a light rail system has been steadily gaining
traction, and a reference from the governor in
his most important speech of the year could
have galvanized further action. Improving
our roads is certainly important and helpful
to residents, but an affordable, efficient sys-
tem of public transportation is what will push
Michigan forward.
What was most apparent during the State
of the State wasn't anything that Snyder said,
but rather everything he didn't say. Despite
massive protests in Lansing over the state
legislature's lame duck session, which saw the
passage of right-to-work and restrictions on
abortion, the governor never mentioned the
new laws. If Snyder is going to support such
divisive policies, he needs to own up to them.
Instead, he hid from the defining moments of
his governorship, failing to address several
key issues. Along with the more than 40 bills
he signed into law since December, Snyder
also failed to mention funding for higher edu-
cation, Detroit's precarious fiscal situation,
the renewed battle over emergency managers
and the growing gun debate. In the next year,
Snyder needs to communicate a clear, spe-
cific vision fortre-energizing Michigan that
addresses the state's most pressing concerns.

Set boundaries, create safety

One in three women will be sexually
assaulted in her lifetime. One in five women
will be raped while in college. As the details
of the sexual assault that occurred in West
Quad Residence Hall last weekend become
clearer, it's important to remember two things:
First, rape can take many forms, but none are
acceptable. Second, there are ways to be as
safe as possible by being alert at all times.
Let's establish that rape, sexual assault
and unwanted touching of any kind is never
the fault of the victim. It doesn't matter what
she's wearing - women are never "asking for
it." Sexual assault can take many forms. Any-
time a woman leaves a sexual encounter feel-
ing uncomfortable because she didn't want it
or felt confused or coerced, this constitutes
sexual assault. Many consider rape to be "real"
only when a stranger violates another strang-
er. This is false. Sexual assault and rape hap-
pen all the time between established couples
or friends with benefits. Since lines between
friendships and casual sexual relationships
are drawn so thin in college, throw a little
alcohol in the mix and you may have the per-
fect circumstance for a sexual assault to occur.
For men: If she says no or acts like she
doesn't want a sexual advance - through body
language or lack of control - stop pursuing. It
doesn't matter how inebriated she is. You might
think your harmless butt-grab or walk-by-
breast-graze is okay, but it's not. That is consid-
ered sexual assault, and no matter how funny or
innocent it seems can make anyone uncomfort-
able. Only make sexual overtures on someone
when it's obviously mutual.
If that means you have to ask before you put
your arm around her, do so. You won't look
stupid. It will be refreshing and appreciated.
For women: Have a plan in mind. Of

course it's never your fault if you are sexually
assaulted, but you can take proactive steps to
prevent being harmed.
First, before a sexual encounter with some-
one set your boundaries clearly. You're allowed
to go as far as you want with someone in a con-
sensual sexual encounter without being consid-
ered a "tease" when you choose to stop. Decide
what you will and won't do. State your bound-
aries clearly, no matter how odd it sounds. As
an Ann Arbor self-defense instructor told me,
never let 30 seconds of potential awkward-
ness and embarrassment stand between you
and your safety. If you feel your red flags go up,
do everything and anything in your power to
leave before it's too late. Of course, there may
be extenuating circumstances where it is not
possible to run or flee the situation. But if it's
an option and you feel even the slightest hint of
"weirdness," trust your gut and remove your-
self from the situation. Again, a minute of awk-
wardness and embarrassment is never worth
the pain that may ensue.
The sexual assault that recently occurred
in West Quad is one of many. Sexual assaults
go unreported for various reasons including
embarrassment, confusion and emotional dis-
tress. If you or a friend has been raped, sexu-
ally assaulted in any manner or is confused
about a sexual encounter, there are places
on campus you can seek help. The Sexual
Assault and Prevention Awareness Center is
a great resource. Never feel embarrassed
or ashamed to seek help. Sexual assault is a
pressing issue on a college campus and we
must look out for each other. No matter if you
know her or not, if you see a woman in trou-
ble, don't let it slide. Get help immediately.

magine this: mice scurry
around your kitchen cupboards
in search'for food. The scent
of sewage fills
your house for
days on end. Your
water suddenly
shuts off. And
all of this is your
landlord's fault.
It's 1970 and
the tenants of
708 E. Kings- KEVIN
ley Street didn't MERSON-
imagine this; BARG
they lived it.
Fortunately, these students could
turn to the Ann Arbor Tenants
Union for help. The AATU mobi-
lized masses of tenants to picket
against the offending landlord. In
part, holding landlords account-
able for tenants' rights was what
the AATU did from its inception
in 1969 until its untimely demise in
2003. It provided an invaluable ser-
vice to tenants across Ann Arbor -
student and non-student alike.
Today, student tenants often rec-
ognize when their rights as tenants
are violated and look for resolutions.
However, these ideas fall on deaf
ears. They lack a vehicle to make
them a reality. They may not realize
it, but they need a powerful advocate.
The AATU was that powerful
advocate. It burst on the Ann Arbor
scene in 1969 as part of what became
a two-year strike against the city's
slumlords. More than 1,500 tenants
around the city rose up in opposi-
tion to poor living conditions and
withheld their rent. Collectively,
they sent their rent money to an
escrow account in Windsor, Ontar-
io. Unless the landlords got their
act together, they wouldn't see a
dime of rent from strikers.
Increasingly, the AATU amassed
victories. It helped numerous ten-

ants reach out-of-court settlements
in their favor. It gained recogni-
tion from landlords as a force to be
reckoned with and became the sole
negotiator for tenants. It lobbied for
and won city ordinances and state
laws that secured tenants' rights.
Moreover, the AATU provided
resources and services to tenants
that catered to their needs. It taught
themto object to illegalcleaningfees
and to withhold rent if their land-
lord failed to fix problems. It warned
tenants of landlords that historically
treated tenants and their housing
poorly. It reviewed tenants' leases
to ensure tenants understood them
and landlords followed the law.
When all else failed,they helped dog
down landlords until they returned
security deposits.
All of this is gone. In its place,
student tenants are left with the
University's StudentLegalServices.
While its legal advice is sometimes
helpful, that's all it can provide to
these tenants. Along with tenants'
other needs, SLS fails to meet the
biggest one: defending their rights.
Increasingly, tenants' rights are
under siege. Landlords constantly
assail the right to affordable housing.
When the University - Ann Arbor's
largest landlord - buys up land, such
as Blimpy Burger, its not-for-profit
status diminishes the taxbaseinAnn
Arbor and thus, through increased
taxes, drives up the rent for everyone
else in the city. Meanwhile, develop-
ers erect 14-story high-rise apart-
ment buildings that cause rents inthe
vicinity to rise higher yet.
On another front, landlords,
such as those in the Washtenaw
Area Apartment Association, cru-
sade against the early lease-signing
ordinance. The ordinance protects
freshmen and current tenants from
landlords that attempt to sign the
next lease as the current lease starts.

Aside from a few brave souls, there is
no organized opposition against this
effort. It's merely another instance in
which tenants' rights are left at the
mercy of landlords.
Landlords take
advantage of
students with few
repercussions.
Student tenants faced the same
stark reality 43 years ago. Rather
than accept the status quo, they
acted. They understood that only a
tenants union could prevent land-
lords from violating tenants' rights
with impunity. They identified
ways to expand and secure their
rights. They then went to work to
create a mechanism to realize those
rights, which became the AATU.
These days, there's a 708 E. King-
sley on every block. While the prob-
lems may have less to do with mice
and more to do with money, student
tenants continue to get the short
end of the stick. More than ever,
tenants need the AATU if they want
to have a fighting chance against
landlord interests in city hall and
Lansing. Once more, students must
rise to the challenge and organize a
tenants union.
A revived AATU would once
again fill a void- a void the Uni-
versity fails to fill. And -upon
return, it would defend tenants'
rights' and provide comprehen-
sive services to tenants with
resolve long unseen. It would be
the fierce advocate we all deserve.

needs to re-invent itself first.
"The greatest challenge to
make that happen isn't any piece
of legislation I've mentioned; it's
not any of the great reforms we've
already done. The greatest chal-
lenge in doing that is really sim-
ple: We just need to go look in the
mirror," Snyder said.
The state needs reformed edu-
cation, more jobs and an annual
billion-dollar investment in safer
and better roads, the governor
said. He added that it is unac-
ceptable that 60 percent of stu-
dents in Michigan need remedial
classes, and that he has a com-
mitment to various state pro-
grams that help children, like the
Department of Natural Resourc-

ence through the underground
YouTube bandwagon," Maynard
- said.
Maynard said his daughter's
interest in YouTube inspired
him to use the site as a medium
to explain his expertise.
"I was blown away by the
emerging YouTube culture
where you've got young people
getting deep, educational con-
tent from sources that aren't
within universities," Maynard
said.
Maynard's fascination with
social media as a communication
tool didn't start with videos. He
has used blogging for four to five
years to connect with a broader
audience as well as to relate and
communicate current affairs
effectively. He also created the
Twitter handle @2020science to
join the developing community
and exchanging of ideas. -
Maynard began creating the
videos in November, each one
focusing on an area in his field of
study, as well as other topics that
fascinate him. In response to the
recent shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary School in Newtown,
Conn., Maynard created a video

assessing the risks of gun vio-
lence.
Maynard said he has a list of
140 ideas to discuss in his videos,
most of which are taken from
the classes he teaches, including
"Principles of Risk Assessment,"
"Environmental Health Policy"
and "Communicating Science
through Social Media." He hopes
to continue posting videos for
at least the next six months but

seen government play a stronger,
friendlier role in certain elemen-
tary schools where social work-
ers have been renamed success
coaches.
In an interview after the
address, State Rep. Jeff Irwin
(D-Ann Arbor) said he hopes that
Snyder will change his uncom-
promising approach with state
Democrats, but fears that will not
be the case.
Irwin said Snyder spoke in
platitudes about higher education
but the governor's past policies
contradict that.
"Time after time, the governor
talking about something that is
import for us in the future, appar-
ently he wants to focus on, then
sort of glosses over the fact that
the past two years he's done just
the opposite," Irwin said.
Snyder's approach to education
has been contradictory, Irwin
suggested. He cited unprecedent-
ed cuts to the state's K-12 and
higher education contributions.

Irwin said many of Snyder's
policies drive young, capable
residents out of the state. He said
Snyder has spearheaded legisla-
tion such as the targeting of gay
and lesbian employees in local
government and colleges, which
is regressive to state development.
Newly inaugurated State Rep.
Gretchen Driskell (D-Scio Twp.)
said she questioned whether Sny-
der was as committed to educa-
tion and making a more attractive
state for graduates as he claimed.
"They made a 15-percent cut
in higher education funding and
they cut K-12 funding. There
was no conversation about that,"
Driskell said.
Driskell added that Snyder
talked about making the state
more innovative after the decline
of the auto-industry, but said pro-
tecting education funding would
have been critical to that goal.
No elected officials represent-
ing Ann Arbor in the state legisla-
ture identify as Republicans.

"Students were grateful (for

said. "They desired a supportive

standing and passion from the
University community.

dents to be more aware of their
actions. She saw a marked
improvement afterward.
"Students in South Quad, I've
noticed, tend to be very competi-
tive, so that was definitely prob-
ably an incentive for people to
participate," Wells said. "When I
would be walking around and I'd
see doors open, the TV wouldn't
be on or the lights would be off,
so people were definitely partici-
pating, which is good to see."
Wells noted that since the six-
week competition's end she has
seen more lights and appliances
left on, perhaps a sign students
are reverting back to former

opportunities and spaces that
represent inclusion," Simpson
said.
Navvab echoed Simpson's
comments on the progressive
evolution of gender-inclusive
housing at the University.
"I think it really helps to have
a lot of strong student voices both
from students who identity as
gender non-conforming as well
as students who were allies that
thought it was important to cre-
ate (a) more inclusive student
space," Navvab said.
Navvab added that she
thought the Open Housing Ini-
tiative could serve as a model for
working with the administration
to pursue change in the Univer-
sity community.

LSA freshman Patryck Piekos

Piekos said he did what he

"I did turn off the mini fridge

a safe space for transgender and
gender non-conforming students
to live in.
"Having that option available
to students will be one step clos-
er to allowing them to feel safe,
secure and sort of comfortable in
their environment," Gordon said.
Logan said he was excited
about the new gender-inclusive
living opportunities because
they support the "diverse needs
of the student body."
"This is part of our growing
efforts to support gender. non-
conforming students, and we
hope it succeeds and grows,"
Logan said.

Junginger said he was encour-

"Whenever I used to leave
my room and the light was on,
they'd be like, 'dude, turn off the
light,' so I'd turn off the light,"
Junginger said. "So that was a
step forward for me."
He believes that making small
changes to his daily routine is
worth it because he "loves the
environment." Like Piekos,
Junginger said he'll continue
these practices even though the
contest is over.
"I think that anything that
positively impacts the environ-

ger said. "If it takes a contest to
get people involved, then that's
what we should do."

Simanek said that it may help to

Chief Health Officer Robert
.Winfield, who is director of the
University Health Service, said
it's important to wash hands with
soap and water or an alcohol-
based solution, such as hand
sanitizer. He added that it is
critical to cover mouths while
coughing and sneezing in order to
prevent germs from spreading.
Winfeld said the best way
to stay healthy is to get a flu
vaccination.
"We know that (the flu
vaccination) decreases the
chance of getting influenza

project.
"The plan is to build a body of
seriously educational resources
that are also interesting, engag-
ing and fun," Maynard said.
Tracy Swinburn, the manag-
ing director of the Risk Science
Center, said Maynard is at the
forefront of using social media
to convey scientific knowledge.
As for his YouTube series, Swin-
burn said she believes he effec-
tively communicates the topics
to a broad audience.
"I think Andrew does such a
great job of making these expla-
nations easy to understand,"
Swinburn said. "It's great that
we can communicate to a broad
range of people on risk science
topics."
However, Maynard said he
hopes to target a younger audi-
ence that uses YouTube as a pri-
mary source of education.
"I think this is going to be
a slow process," he said. "But
what we're finding is that there
is an increasing recognition with
more views going up."
His most-viewedvideo, titled
"Does wearing a hat keep you
warm while dancing naked?"
currently has more than 10,000
views.
Public Health student Adam
Siddiqu said the provoca-
tive titles of Maynard's videos
grabbed his attention.
"At first I was confused about
it, then I definitely learned a lot
from the video," Siddiqui said.
"That just shows that those vid-
eos can be a great learning tool
for people at all levels of educa-
tion."
Siddiqui said he was first
introduced to Maynard's videos
after he spoke to his class at ori-
entation. He added that Maynard
remarked there has to be a way to

"Ifyouhave ascold - even ifyou

"If, on' the other hand, you're

ter engage them in the field.
Maynard said for his social
media course he has students
write a blog post every week for
10 weeks on the website "Mind
the Science Gap." He said the
students work independently
while writing their blogs.
"I don't read it beforehand.
I don't edit it," Maynard said.
"They are solely responsible for
what they write, and they are
solely responsible for what hap-
pens after they press publish."
Maynard said he would like to
see the University follow his lead
in establishing more of a pres-
ence in online academia.
"You look at the Univer-
sity, and we've got incredible
expertise here, and yet there's
an incredibly small amount of
expertise that trickles out into
the public," Maynard said. "If
you think about us as a public
institution, it's sort of our obliga-
tion to make this accessible to a
wider audience."
The University currently
offers free online courses to
users around the world through
the Coursera platform.
Maynard added that online
education lands between the
formal education of a University
andsthe informal education of a
museum. Before former Social
Media Director Jordan Miller
resigned in December, Maynard
spoke to her about how to reach
this goal.
"We're very, very poor at
understanding how to maximize
the use of the way people are
using those (social media) for
learning," Maynard said. "Just as
we've invested in formal educa-
tion, and just as we've invested
in informal education, we now
need to work how to invest in
informal online education."

Obad Netanyahu seem
headed for U.S.-Israel clash

Israeli PM not
concerned about a
displeased president
JERUSALEM (AP) - Isra-
el's premier on Wednesday
dismissed President Barack
Obama's reported displeasure
with his hard-line policies
toward the Palestinians, a sisgn
that the two could be headed
for a showdown.
Polls suggest Benjamin Netan-
yahuis poised to win Israel's elec-
tions next week and continue in
office.
This week an American colum-
nist with close ties to the White
House describedObama's disdain
for Netanyahu, warning that Isra-
el's all-important relations with
the U.S. could suffer in unprece-
dented ways if the Israeli govern-
ment doesn't change its policies.
Such a clash would come at a
tense time when regional devel-
opments appear to be working
against Israel.
Israel and the U.S. are seen as
disagreeing over how and when
to deal with Iran's suspect
nuclear program, and Islamist

parties that Israel perceives as
hostile are gaining clout in the
Mideast.
As the world deals with those'
issues, even Israel's close allies
are getting increasingly fed up
with what they see as defiant
Israeli settlement construction
on lands the Palestinians want
for astate.
The column Tuesday'by Jef-
frey Goldberg about Obama's
attitudes toward Netanyahu
dominated Israeli news media,
leading some Israeli officials to
fume that Americans were try-
ing to sway the results of next
Tuesday's parliamentary elec-
tions.
Netanyahu seemed to sug-
gest that when reporters asked
him to respond to the column in
Bloomberg News.
"We all understand that
only Israeli citizens will deter-
mine who faithfully represents
Israel's vital interests," he
told reporters, dismissing the
reported criticism.
. In his , column, Goldberg
wrote that Obama seems to
view Netanyahu as a political
coward whose unwillingness to
make concessions to the Pales-

tinians is plunging his country
into diplomatic isolation.
"Israel doesn't know what its
own best interests are," Gold-
berg cited Obama as saying.
While the U.S. will not cut
off aid to Israel or waver on its
commitment to stop Iran from
developing nuclear weapons,
Goldbergwrote, Israel mightnot
be able to count on U.S. vetoes at
the U.N. Security Council, as it
has in the past, when the world
lines up against it.
Goldbergindicated that out of
frustration with the peacemak-
ingdeadlock,Obamamightpres-
ent his own idea about a future
state of Palestine - includ-
ing endorsing the Palestinian
demand to divide Jerusalem
between the two sides, a concept
Netanyahu rejects.
The White House did not
deny the harsh sentiments
Goldberg . put in Obama's
mouth. The tone and timing
of column suggested the U.S.
leader might be readying to play
hardball with Netanyahu if the
prime minister is re-elected -
or conversely, wash his hands
of the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict altogether.

Mali: French troops begin land
assault in struggle against al- Qaida.

Same group
occupied Algerian
natural gas complex
Wednesday
BAMAKO, Mali (AP) -
French soldiers pressed north
in Mali territory occupied by
radical Islamists on Wednesday,
launching a land assault that
was to put them in direct combat
with al-Qaida-linked fighters "in
one to 72 hours," military offi-
cials said.
Their presumed destination
was the town of Diabaly, where
fleeing residents said Islamist
extremists had taken over their .
homes and were preventing
other people from leaving. They
said the militants were melting
into the population and moving
only in small groups on streets in
the mud-walled neighborhoods
to avoid being targeted by the
French.
"They have beards. And they
wear boubous (a flowing robe).
No one approaches them. Every-
one is afraid," said Ibrahim Kom-
notogo, who was out of town
when the militants seized Dia-

baly over the weekend but kept in
contact by telephone with other
residents.
In apparent retaliation for
the French offensive, the same
group controlling northern Mali
occupied a natural gas complex
in neighboring Algeria, taking
dozens of people hostage, includ-
ing Americans. Two foreigners
were killed.
French ground operations in
Mali began overnight, France's
military chief of staff, Adm.
Edouard Guillaud, said on
Europe 1 television Wednesday.
He stressed that French infantry
units "will be fighting directly in
the coming hours."
Armored vehicles loaded with
French troops were seen head-
ing toward Niono, a town 340
kilometers (210 miles) northeast
of the capital, Bamako. Some 70
kilometers (45 miles) northeast
of Niono lies Diabaly, with a pop-
ulation of 35,000.
Over the weekend, dozens of
rebel vehicles cut off the road to
Diabaly, seizing the town and its
strategic military camp. French
warplanes have since carried out
airstrikes on the camp.
Oumar Ould Hamaha, whose
fighters are believed to be among

those who seized Diabaly, said
that a convoy of armored French
vehicles attempted to enter the
town to take it back. He said the
Islamists repelled the French
after an intense and close combat.
"I confirm that France came in
by land, but they failed. ... There
was a combat that was (extreme-
ly close). Between 200 and 500
meters away," Hamaha said.
His version of events could not
be verified.
Col. Thierry Burkhard, a
spokesman for the French mili-
tary in Paris, denied that French
troops were in Diabaly or that
they were 500 meters from rebel
lines.
"The French army did not
deploy units in the region of
Diabaly," Burkhard said. Troops
were dozens of kilometers from
Diabaly, he said, refusing to pro-
vide a location.
. Hamaha is a leader of the
Movement for Oneness and
Jihad in West Africa, one of the
rebel groups controlling Mali's
northern half. He is also a close
associate of Moktar Belmokar,
a leader of a local al-Qaida cell
who claimed responsibility for
the kidnapping of foreigners in
Algeria.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

A far way from Ghana, Opare waits on draft day

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Writer.
On a chilly November night
at the U-M Soccer Complex, the
Michigan men's soccer team
was locked in a scoreless draw in
its regular-season finale against
Michigan State.
The Wolverines' season had
previously included a thrilling
3-2 overtime victory over Ohio
State and a stunning upset of
Indiana, the eventual national
champioa. But sitting a game
below .500, Michigan needed a
win to put itself in position for
an NCAA Tournament berth.
With only 20 minutes remain-
ing, each passing second put the
Wolverines in peril of missing.
the Big Dance in consecutive
years for the, first time since
2006-07.
Then, the unlikeliest of
heroes rose up for Michigan. It
wasn't junior midfielder Fabio
Pereira, who led the team in
goals. It wasn't sophomore mid-
fielder Tyler Arnone, the first-
team All-Big Ten selection. It
wasn't even junior forward T.J.
Roehn, the Wolverines' most
prolific striker.
No, it was senior defender'
Kofi Opare - face mask and all -
leaping above a Spartan defend-
er to head home the go-ahead
goal. The Wolverines weathered
a Michigan State rally to win,
1-0, and the momentum helped
them reach the Big Ten cham-
pionship game and a second-
round appearance in the NCAA
Tournament.
Opare's game-winning strike
as a defender epitomizes the
long journey of his life. Born in
Ghana but raised in South Afri-
ca, Opare was as far from Amer-
ican collegiate soccer as anyone
on the planet.
He grew up playing cricket,
one of the rainbow nation's
most popular sports. But once
in school, Opare and his brother
joined their school's soccer team.
and both began following the
professional leagues. And when
his family.moved to the United
States to pursue job opportuni-
ties, Opare had no choice but
to focus on soccer because he
couldn't find many people who

played cricket.
When Opare first stepped on
campus as a student in 2009,'
former Michigan coach Steve
Burns knew he had landed one
of the best prospects of his
career.
"We had high expectations
for him," Burns said, reflect-
ing on his former player.."We
thought he was gonnabe a can't-
miss pro."
Perhaps, then, Opare fell
short of expectations. After
being named to the Big Ten All-
Freshman team and helping to
guide the Wolverines to a pro-
gram-best College Cup appear-
ance the following year, Opare
and Michigan struggled in 2011.

hree Big Ten 22. Burns said he "expects"

Opare tobe drafted.
"I was excited to receive the
invite," Opare said. "Obviously,
I credit that to my teammates.
I'd also like to dedicate it to my
family, as well as my brother
who I grew up playing with."
And Burns, who texted his
former player to congratulate
him on the opportunity, expect-
ed that Opare would make a
good impression on the MLS
scouts.
"The thing that people really
get excited about is when they
first see Kofi, they see that he's a
really high-level athlete," Burns
said. "When you look at the role
of a center back, Kofi fits that
role very well."
Even as a freshman, Opare
committed himself to soc-

cer like a 'professional ath-
lete. Burns said that the young
defender treated his studies
and the people around him with
incredible poise and has "done a
really good job getting himself
ready for this moment."
In high school, Opare played
for both his school and a club,
team- the St. Catharine's Con-
cord Gunners - leading both to
championships.
His success prompted an
invitation to the U.S. under-20
squad. Opare is also a Canadi-
an citizen, which could appeal
to the three Canadian MLS
franchises. And after reaching
the NCAA Tournament twice,
Opare feels like he has accom-
plished everything he came to
do at Michigan.
"It's a great feeling because
you know all of those players
who played before you and what
they have contributed to the
program," he said. "I just want-
ed to contribute to that."
It's safe to say that Opare
has left quite a mark on the
soccer program. Despite last
year's injuries, Opare started 71
matches in his collegiate career
and ranks fifth in program his-
tory for minutes played (6,411).
He was a captain as a senior,
defensive MVP in 2011 and
played in more contests than.all
but 12 players in Michigan soc-
cer's 12-ye'ar history.
Despite all of the memories,
Opare remembers his most
cherished moments clearly. In
2010, the Wolverines compiled a
17-win season en route to a berth
in the national semifinal - two
firsts for the program. Opare's
only point of the year came on
an assist in the quarterfinal
match, a 3-2 overtime thriller
over No. 3 Maryland.
Two years later, his surprise
header against Michigan State
made for another unforgettable
experience.
But Opare's four years at
Michigan offered him more than
just an opportunity to prove his
worth as an athlete. The senior
found time to dedicate himself
to schoolwork and says he feels
"fortunate" to attend a well-
respected University.
He expects to graduate with
a degree in neuroscience, which
Opare said led to numerous busy
and stressful nights. But his
friends and academic advisors
helped him achieve his goals,
and he will now leave Michigan
with a variety of future oppor-
tunities.
And as Opare has excelled
on and off the field, his peers
continue to be impressed with
his friendly and respectful
demeanor. When asked about
his accomplishments, Opare
always credits his teammates
and coaches for their support.
But when the MLS invited
54 college seniors to compete
in Florida, they knew clearly
where Michigan's talent lay - in
a humble and unheralded center
back.
Opare's journey has spanned
large parts of the world, quietly
beginning in Ghana and South
Africa and recently featuring a
header that sent maize-clad fans *
wild. This week, he will learn
his future while watching the
draft online.
"Every kid, growing up and
playing soccer, you want to try

to push yourself to the highest
level of competition you can play
at," Opare said. "It's no different
with me."
Everyone has dreams. Opare
might just see his come true.

Freshman forward Glen Robinson 111 could be tasked with guarding Minnesota's Rodney Williams who is viewed by some as the most athletic player in the Big Ten.
Next challenge waits in Gophers

By EVERETT COOK

Last Sunday was a good test
for the Michigan basketball
team, but in the end, it didn't
reveal much.
It's hard to gauge how a young
team that gets significant min-
utes from five ° true freshmen
will respond
to the first Michigan at

lenge of the Minnesota
season, espe- Matchup:

line.
The Wol- TV/Radio:
verines looked tSPN
awful in the
first half, and needed a 21-point
comeback to tie up the game late
in the second half. In the end,
though, five of the eight leaders
in minutes played suffered the
first loss of their college careers
for No. 5 Michigan.
The challenge only gets
tougher on Thursday night when
the Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten,
16-1 overall) will take on Min-
nesota (3-1, 15-2), who freshman

pointguard Spike Albrecht calls,
"freakishly athletic." This game,
not the one last Sunday, is the
game that will end up defining
the early stretch of Michigan's
season.
Why? For a team as young as
the Wolverines, the response to
the first loss of the year is more
important than the actual loss.
This would be true against any
,Big Ten team, but it's especially
true for a road game against the
veteran, ninth-ranked Golden
Gophers.
On paper, the biggest chal-
lenge for Michigan would be
another tough, loud atmosphere
on the road. That environment
will be a factor, but it's not neces-
sarily the thing Michigan coach
John Beilein is most concerned
with.
"It's not as much about the
loud," he said. "It's about the
quickness and the intensity and
the speed that some of the teams
in the Big Ten have. Minnesota is
no different."
The Gophers present several
matchup problems that make
Beilein more concerned with the
talent on the floor rather than
the noise from the stands.
The first is fifth-year senior
Trevor Mbakwe, Minnesota's
star forward who was forced to

sit out most of last season with
a knee injury. He averaged a
double-double in his junior year
while leading the conference in
rebounding. This season, he's
less than two rebounds and one
point per game from getting
back to that point.
"Mbakwe causes problems
just because he's a tremendous
rebounder, shot blocker, dunker
- the whole deal," Beilein said.
"He doesn't need much space,
he operates really well in small
spaces."
Against Ohio State, one of
the biggest positional battles
was between Buckeye forward
Deshaun Thomas and Wolver-
ine forward Glenn Robinson
III. Thursday, it doesn't look
like Robinson will get much of a
break. The freshman will likely
be tasked with guarding Gopher
senior Rodney Williams, whose
12.5 points per game is good for
second-best for Minnesota.
Like Thomas, Williams . is
6-foot-7, and like Thomas, he
possesses the athleticism to
crash the boards like a center
while being able to play offen-
sively from the wing and the
post. .
"Williams plays way above
the rim," Beilein said. "He's
probablythe most athletic player

in the Big Ten."
The week of practice follow-
ing a loss is important, particu-
larly the first loss of the season
for a team to have a short mem-
ory. It's impossible to duplicate
a tough road atmosphere, but
Beilein was still encouraged by
how his team responded to the
loss.
"There's a hit-home type of
attitude," Beilein said. "I love
the way we responded yesterday
in practice, there was no finger
pointing."
Added sophomore pointguard
Trey Burke: "I think the level of
intensity is higher (in practice)
when we lose. A loss humbles
teams and allows them to make
adjustments and get better. Our
practice yesterday was similar to
that."
On Wednesday, a question
was floated to Beilein about
whether the game against Min-
nesota was considered a "must-
win." All the veteran coach
could do was smile.
"I'd be dead if I looked at
games like that," Beilein said.
"The journey and the process
is what leads you to the end, so
there is never a must win."
Maybe not a must win, but a
game that will prove a lot about
Michigan nonetheless.

Denard Robinson, the former
Michigan quarterback who set the
all-time NCAA quarterback rush-
ing record in the Outback Bowl on
Jan. 1, now has the label of "wide
receiver" slapped beside his name
for the foreseeable future.
With the 2013 NFL draft just
three months away, ESPN draft
analyst Mel Kiper Jr. laid out his
projections for Robinson, as well
as the remaining Michigan foot-
ball seniors, on a conference call
Wednesday afternoon.
"He's just a great football play-
er," Kiper said of Robinson, who
heads down to Mobile, Ala. this
week for Senior Bowl practices. "I
think everybody loves his passion
for the game, his toughness. Obvi-
ously he's got great speed, great
athleticism, great versatility. He
can catchtheball, he canrunwith
the ball.
"After he runs, after. he tests,
after he works out, Ithink Denard
Robinson is no later than a sec-
ond-round draft choice."
Robinson has just three catch-
es in his career and has never
returned a punt, but he'll be used
at both positions in Senior Bowl
practices in preparation for his
future role in the NFL.
Some have theorized that Rob-
inson could end up as a corner-
back at the next level, but Kiper
still pegs him as "an offensive
entity" and a threat in the return
game. He said Robinson could
help himself at the Senior Bowl
if he draws comparisons to Ant-
waan Randle El, a second-round
pick out of Indiana as a quarter-
back. He may not have a position
secured, but Robinson will no
doubt impress scouts at the Senior
Bowl and upcoming NFL Com-
bine by simply doing what he does
best, Kiper said, and that's using
his speed and toughness.
MID-ROUND PICKS: A for-
mer five-star defensive tackle out
of Detroit, 6-foot-5, 308-pound
Will Campbell is one of the more
"intriguing" cases in this draft,
Kiper said.
"You just kept waiting and
waiting," Kiper said. "He did
flash, an various times, future
NFL ability. We know he has the,
physical capabilities and physical
presence you want, you just kept

waiting for that performance to
elevate him into the early-round
mix. It didn'thappen, for me."
Campbell emerged as some-
thing of a space-eater in the mid-
dle for Michigan this fall, tallying
44 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and
a sack, but his numbers never
matched his potential. Kiper sees
him as mid-to-late-round talent
with early-round potential.
"We've seen it happen before,
the light goes on and they become
a guy who can at least help you as
a backup," Kiper said.
Kiper also praised safety Jor-
dan Kovacs and linebacker Kenny
Demens and slotted them as
"middle-round possibilities."
Kovacs, a former walk-on
turned team captain, had 68
tackles, two sacks and an inter-
ception this fall. Demens added
82 tackles, six for loss and an
interception.
"I want to see Demens and
Kovacs at least have a chance to
push themselves onto an NFL
roster as maybe fifth- or sixth-
round picks," Kiper said.
LATE-ROUND PICKS,
FREE AGENTS: Kiper high-
lighted receiver Roy Roundtree
as "a guy who can make a team
as a fifth receiver" and should fall
into the late rounds.
Roundtree exploded in his
sophomore season, Robinson's
first as starting quarterback,
accumulating 72 catches for 935
yards and seven touchdowns,
but floundered since - except
for two highlight-reel catches
in victories over Notre Dame in
2011 and Northwestern in 2012.
His production picked backup
once junior Devin Gardner took
over as quarterback. Roundtree
finished his fifth-year senior
season 31 catches for 580 yards
and three touchdowns.
The analyst made quick ref-
erence to cornerback J.T. Floyd,
who was suspended for the Out-
back Bowl for a violation of team
rules, and Craig Roh.
"Floyd, the kid's got ability,"
Kiper said. "Roh is another kid
that's got a chance."
Kiper made no mention
of offensive guard Patrick
Omameh, who was named first-
team All-Big Ten this fall or of
center Elliott Mealer, who will
take part in the NFLPA Bowl on
Jan. 19.

'M' set to extend streak in Evanston

program-best 10-game win
streak.
Oh, and Michigan (3-0, 14-2)
is off to its best start in program
history.
Life is good for the Wolver-
ines.
"It's really great for our pro-
gram to be recognized," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "I think it would be great
for people around the country to
see Michigan women's basket-
ball in the Top 25.
"But I don't want us to get
caught up in all that because I
don't want us to forget how we
got here and what we're trying
to do."
Instead of getting caught up
in the national fanfare, first-year
head coach Barnes Arico is going
to continue pushing the Wolver-

ines to do what they do best: get-
ting the ball to the seniors.
Through the first 16 games
of the season, Michigan's five
seniors have been the key to its
success - senior guard Jenny
Ryan, senior forward Kate
Thompson and senior center
Rachel Sheffer are all scoring in
double digits. Thompson leads
the way with 15.4 points per
game. Her 3.69 3-pointers per
game is not only ateam best, but
also second in the Big Ten.
Thompson is coming off her
worst performance of the season
- a six-point showing - against
Wisconsin where she was held
without a 3-pointer for the first
time all season.
"I thought Wisconsin did a
great job on Kate," Barnes Arico
said. "I thought (Sunday) was
just the night we couldn't get
anyone going. Rachel wasn't
making plays. Kate wasn't mak-
ing plays. (Senior forward) Sam
(Arnold) came in and didn't real-
ly make any plays. So all the peo-
ple that have really helped us on
the offensive end really couldn't
get it going."
The cold offensive showing
against the Badgers could have
ended the Wolverines' winning
streak but instead showcased
the team's versatility. With two
offensive threats shut down
against Wisconsin, the Wolver-
ines looked to Ryan to lead the
way - and she did so perfectly.
"Wisconsin really exposed
us offensively," Barnes Arico
said Sunday. "(But) Jenny really
stepped up when we needed her.
Tonight she knew that we need-
ed her to score, and she did what
she had to do to help us find a
way to win. She was incredible."

Senior Kate Thompson is second in the Big Ten in 3-pointers a game this season.

Ryan scored a career-high 19
points and played all 40 min-
utes. But the Wolverines will
need production from elsewhere
going forward.
"My philosophy, is to take it
one game at a time and really not
look past your next opponent,"
Barnes Arico said.
Going into their game against
Northwestern, the Wolverines
will look to shake off their slow
offensive showing and continue
finding new ways to score.
The Wildcats' .500 record is
misleading. Northwestern lost
two games to top-10 teams by
only four points each and has
proven to be a trickier opponent
than anticipated.

The Wildcats have five players
that average double digits. For-
ward Kendall Hackney leads the
team in scoring with 14.6 points
per game and forward Dannielle
Diamant's 8.1 rebounds pergame
also leads the team. In addition,
Northwestern has guard Karly
Roser, who averages 6.3 assists
per-game, which is second in the
Big Ten and 16th in the nation.
The Wildcats have a huge size
advantage over Michigan and
will have to attack the post when
they are on offense. The Wolver-
ines have had size issues in most
of their games this season, but
their quickness and ball move-
ment have helped them compen-
sate.

Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson is expected to be drafted by Round 2.

U-M Poetry returns
to the campus scene
after long hiatus
By JOHN BOHN
Daily Arts Writer
Google "Def Jam Poetry" and
watch some of the videos that
come up. You'll see various poets
performing, speaking of race,
gender, identity and love, both
in humor and in complete seri-
ousness. Occasionally, you'll find
an appearance by Kanye West
or DMX. The nature of spoken-
word performance is debatable,
and even more up in the air is its
origin. Poets can even look as far
back into history as Sappho of
Lesbos, typically depicted with a
lyre in hand.

In the 1980s, a phenomenon
within the world of spoken word
took form with the advent of the
slam poetry competition. The
format was simple: Poets would
perform a two- to three-minute
piece before an audience and five
judges selected from within that
audience. Slam poetry became
its own culture with its own
traditions: booing bad scores,
praising good ones and gener-
ally encouraging the performer
when you like his or her piece by
snapping or shouting the occa-
sional "preach!" and "mmm."
From its humble Chicago ori-
gins, slam poetry spread across
the nation, evolving into a much
greater cultural event.
On Jan. 12, the University
Poetry Club hosted a slam com-
petition in the Union. Spon-

sored by the Center for Campus
Involvement, U-M Poetry Club
- once known as U-Club Poet-
ry - provides slam competi-
tions and open-mic formats for
aspiring poets at the University.
Saturday's event was the grand
slam, where poets competed for
a position on -the University's
national slam team. About 100
students attended, providing
energy and enthusiasm that per-
meated the packed room.
Engineering sophomore Wil-
liam Royster and LSA freshman
Mimi Norwood are two of the
poets who made the national
team. For Royster, this was his
first performance in a slam for-
mat and his first appearance at a
U-M Poetry event.
"It was a great crowd," Roys-
ter said. "Sometimes you get dull

crowds, and it can really harm
your performance."
"It was just an easy crowd to
go up in front of," Norwood said.
Last year, however, things
were a little different for U-M
Poetry.
"By the end of last year, we
had an attendance of 15 people,"
said LSA junior Alexander Pan.
"It's not anyone's fault really; it
was just poor organization from
everyone."
Pan joined the group last win-
ter when numbers were dwin-
dling, and since then, he has
been spearheading the effort to
revitalize the group.
"If the students don't show
interest, we're clearly not meant
to be funded and be a club here,"
Pan said.

Over the past few weeks,
India has been talked
about in the news for
one of the worst possible rea-
sons. On Dec. 16, a 23-year-old
woman was
raped by six
men on a
public bus
and abused
so severely
that she died
in the hos-
pital 13 days
later. These PROMA
events have KHOSLA
put a harsh
spotlight on
the way Indian culture treats
women and the deep-seated
misogyny for which an entire
nation must answer.
This is supposed to be my
fun Bollywood column where
I talk about singing and danc-
ing and ask why there's always
so much wind blowing in the
lead actress's face. But anyone
who has ever taken a humani-
ties class - or to be slightly less
pretentious, anyone who has
ever engaged with pop culture
- knows that the media has an
undeniable influence in shaping
a society's attitudes and actions.
Since we're on the subject of
women, the easiest example of
screen trends shaping cultural
values is in female body image.
Women in the media are notori-
ously taller and thinner than
their audience counterparts,
but since the faces and bodies
of models and actresses are the
images bombarding our eyes
on a daily basis, they become
ingrained in the collective
consciousness of society. We've
started to accept them as nor-
mal.
India is no exception to the
tricks of the media trade. Despite
its reputation asa third-world
countryrooted in ancient cus-
toms, it's a nation bolting into the
modern era so quickly that the
citizens aren't quite sure how to
balance modernity and tradition.
In my first column, I wrote
about the film "Dilwale Dulhani-
ya Le Jayenge" and mentioned
a specific scene in which the
heroine Simran (Kajol) drinks
alcohol for the firsttime and
wakes up terrified that she might
have slept with Raj (Shahrukh
Khan). He explains indignantly
that he would never do such a
thing because he is an Indian boy
who knows how to respect an
Indiangirl.
Even with that kind of ide-
alism in popular films, India
has always been a country of
extremes; a country where wom-
en's cultural clothing usually cov-
ers most of the body, but also one
where nothing is said when the
same women are stared at inde-
cently wherever they go; a coun-
try where the celebrated Hindu
goddess Durga single-handedly
defeated a demon, but where mil-
lions of women are still forbidden
from enteringthe workforce.
This is the country where I
was groped on a train the last
time I visited - and when I
immediately told my mother
about it, she said "So?" That's
when itchit home.
My mother, raised ina liberal
home and always encouraged
to follow her dreams and never
pressured into marriage, thought
being grabbed on a train was the

most normal thing in the world.
It was something to be shrugged
off and accepted, andIwas the
one overreacting because some
asshat treated my butt like his
suitcase handle.
The attitudes practiced and
preached in thattouching scene
of DDLJ have longsince vanished

from commercial Bollywood.
The "actresses" - I use quotation
marks because acting is rarely
ever prioritized - have gotten
thinner, lighter and taller. A.
troubling fabric shortage in the
industry has left them with little
to wear besides bikini tops and
booty shorts.
In popular commercial films,
this is the sad restrictive role
to which women are confined.
They allow the plot to progress
by positioning themselves as
romantic or sexual interests,
and the rest of the time they
play dumb and look sexy for all
the voyeurs tired of saris and
respect. Sexuality has always
been an underlying theme in
Bollywood movies;as evidenced
by the extravagant item num-
bers and leading ladies made
famous for their subtle and
unattainable allure.
The recent trend has been
to reclaim the Indian woman's
sexuality, but there is a fine
line between embracing it and
exploiting it. Songs like "Sheila
Ki Jawani" and "Chikni Cha-
meli" push these boundaries.
I love both, and I admire the
attempt (even if it is accidental)
to accept that Indian women
are in control of their sexuality.
Unfortunately, the presenta-
tion does more to objectify than
liberate.
However, as I said, India is
a land of extremes. So while
the fair and lovely opportun-
ists of the industry gather up
their cleavage for another day
of work, somewhere out in Film
City, there are serious and tal-
ented artists doing incredible
work for Indian women.
Inciting change
would be real
movie magic.
In my last column, I starting
singing my unending praises for
director Vishal Bhardwaj, a man
whose films consistently feature
strong, driven women portrayed
by intelligent and talented
actresses. In "Ishqiya," a 2010
original he co-wrote, the main
woman Krishna (Vidya Balan)
is unapologetic about her lying,
violence and sexuality.
More recently, Balan played
awoman in search of her miss-
ing husband in "Kahaani," a
film that has earned her endless
praise from critics and audiences
- a rare combination of artistic
appreciation and audience accep-
tance. In the end, her character
ends up being an homage to
the goddess Durga, a widowed
mother seeking revenge for her
husband's death in aterrorist
attack.
The fact of the matter is that
the media doesn't tell people
what to think; it tells us what to
think about. With so many eyes
from all over the world trained
on the culture that allowed such
violent acts of rape and murder to
ever be committed, the conversa-
tion has finally started.
This columnwas never intend-
ed to be political, but Bollywood
has the power and resources to
overhaul India's treatment of
women. With movies that feature

strong females, healthy gender
dynamics and admirable cultural
values, that change may be pos-
sible. And that would be true
movie magic.

of humanity. And then you have
to ask yourself, 'Why do they say
that we are the highest animals on
earth?' I say, 'high on what?"'
OyamO's plays have appeared
on stages across the country. Some
of his best-known works include
"Selfish Sacrifice," "The White
Black Man," "City in a Strait" and
"Sing Jubilee."
His most celebrated achieve-
ments as an eminent playwright
include the 1999 Eric Kocher
Playwrights Award for "The

Playwrights Conference of 1998.
OyamO was also awarded a PEW/
TCG Playwright-in-Residence
Fellowship in 2000 at the Phila-
delphia Theatre Company.
OyamO has helped pave the
road for what is becoming a new

theatrical genre with work that,
according to some critics, can dis-
turb even the most impervious
audience members.
"A man is a man, a woman is
a woman and a child is a child,"
Oyamo said. "It's very disturb-
ing to see how these differences
separate us and make us violent
towards each other."
"We have knowledge, technol-
ogy, the ability to explore the uni-
verse," he said. "Then what are we
fighting each other forYouwould
think that by now, we'd figure out
how to live on this earth together."

more in class," Kass said.
But Red Beard isn't just about
getting books published or being a
business - they have also under-
taken a mission to reinvigorate
youth in Ann Arbor and else-'
where.
"It's about giving a voice to
youth, but we also didn't want to
be the 'voice of youth.' We just
wanted to have good poems,"
Chamness said.
The press focuses on poet-
ry and writing that they think
should be heard. And thanks to
the efforts of these teens, it finally
has the chance to be.
"We want to create this new
canon of poems and writers that
people don't necessarily think of
as the great writers of our time.
We want to give them the stage,"
Kass said.
"This is poetry that probably
speaks to (you) a little more about

contemporary issues. We like to
have work that's really examining
what it means to be alive and tobe
a young person right now ... (with)
all of the different influences
swirling around you." Kass said.
Anyone wanting to see this
type of poetry in action need not
wait long - Red Beard Press is
having a release party on Jan. 18
for its newest book, "Electric Bite
Women," which is the work of
University students Haley Patail
and Carlina Duan, who is a Daily
Arts Editor.
Although some poems do end
up having a message, there is a
deeper level of meaning that these
poets manage to tap into. The act
of writing is a very personal thing,
and even poems that don't have
an explicit direction can still be
interesting and relevant to a teen-
ager's life.
"I do use writing as a space for
exercising a lot of voice and power
and working through ideas and
that can be explicitly political ...
all of these things that are rel-
evant to me and my community,"
Chamness said.
"I didn't necessarily have (a
message), and I didn't want it tobe
easily coherent in that way, but in
some ways having all of these dif-
ferent things in it was something
that felt important." Chamness
added.
Since kids todaymight not have

ample opportunities to explore
the more experimental side of lit-
erature and poetry and since the
most exposure that many kidswill
have to poetry will be in the class-
room (and even that is waning), it
is becoming even more important
for them to be able to experience
different types of writing as an art
form.
Reigniting a passion for words
"In the context of the way
public-school education has been
going these days, creativity and
imagination has been eliminat-
ed from the curriculum," Kass
said. "It's crucial that there's an
opportunity for young people to
be in the community and working
on developing their voices ... All
those kind of questions that don't
get asked in class are the kind of
questions that we ask students to
pursue."
Red Beard Press has certainly
injected much-needed artistic
vigor into the youth of Ann Arbor.
There has been an outpouring of
support as the press has sold out
of every book that has been pub-
lished so far. Even more impor-
tantly, the young people attending
the book releases and poetry
events put on by Neutral Zone are
able to discover for themselves
what poetry is really all about, or
rather what poetry canbe about.

"There were kids coming up
and saying, 'This is really cool, I
didn't know that you could write
poetry like that; I didn't know you
were allowed to do that, " Geva
said. "We're letting kids hear that
there are a lot of different ways to
be a poet."
Le explained her growth as a
writer in a way that may remind.
many people of their own expe-
riences of growing up and find-
ing a sense of self - certainly
something that teens and other
young people in the community
might be going through them-
selves.
"I think that for me, it's my
way of modeling back to the
community, that people should
take themselves seriously," Le
said. "You may not think your
voice is important, but it prob-
ably is. It took a long time I think
to take myself seriously."
"I already felt so strongly that
the work of the youth here and
elsewhere was incredible and
worthy of notice," Chamness
said.
"There's this idea that it's
kind of less important or less
likely to be good or undeveloped.
The fact that there's consistently
good work coming out of young
people - and coming out of
young people in this community
- is something that I feel like is
worth celebrating."

hile browsing the
"New and Note-
worthy" section of
the ever-growing Apple App
Store, inevitably downloading
four or five
programs to
use and then
lose within
a week, I
chuckled at
the headliner,
bright and
bold, front
and center: CARLY
"New Year, KEYES
New You:
Apps to Start
Off the Year Right."
There are two things infinite-
ly wrong here. First, just because
we desire to remedy our lifestyle
on Jan. 2 (let's be honest, most
people are still recovering on
Jan. 1 from what I'll call "poor
nutritional choices"), it doesn't
guarantee long-term success. If
we really want to improve our
health, whether it's cleaning up
our diet or ramping up the exer-
cise, we don't have to wait for an
arbitrary, socially stereotyped
date on a calendar. The best time
to make a change in our life is
right now. A moment of weak-
ness when that carb craving hits
doesn't mean we have to wait
until the start of 2014 to get back
on course.
Second, apart from the obvi-
ous psychological trap door of the
New Year'sresolution, the notion
that Apple applications can help
us better achieve our health and
fitness goals is ludicrous.
But it's just another prod-
uct intelligently marketed and
attractively advertised that
Americans flock to this time of
year in hopes that objects will
change our behavior.
As an aggregate, our country
is.currently spending millions
of dollars on gym memberships,
diet plans, workout equipment,
etc. But after we go out and buy
snazzy new running shoes, we
still have to strap them on and
use them. After we make that
novel trip to the grocery store
to fill our cart with the healthy
stuff we never eat, there's still
a chance those veggies will rot
in the fridge because, let's face
it, it's hard to dodge the allur-
ing aroma of Blimpy Burger and .
Cottage Inn (there's a reason
why Jimmy John's offers "free
smells").
ButI clicked anyway, curious
about these "life-altering" digi-
tal tools. The most ridiculously
overpriced and overcomplicated
application offered is an activ-

ity tracker called rubiTrack3
($39.99). For 40 bucks, you'd
think the damn thing would
burn caloriesfor you. Instead, I
use free websites like mapmy-
run.com to measure how far I'm
running outdoors, and when
I'm at the gym, every workout
machine practically smacks me
in the face with more big, red,
glowing statistics than I ever
care to know:
As for keeping track, just
spend a couple bucks on a
notebook. Remember those?
The kind with paper? There's
something special about writing
my goals and results by hand.
It inspires me to to jot down
thoughts about my progress and
the challenges I face. If there's
anythingI've learned, it's that
thoughts become things, and
mental fitness is just as impor-
tant, if not more so, than physi-
cal perseverance.
Now, I'm not saying health
and fitness apps aren't useful.
But they won't transform your
health for you; there certainly
isn't an app for that. I remember
vividly my own transformation
process - when I sincerely com-
mitted to improving my health
and fitness, and the only way
Apple contributed wasby fueling
my workouts with some upbeat
tunes.
There is no
app that can
replace real
exercise.
But if you really think that
your iPhone will make an ideal
accountabilitybuddy, any Nike+
app provides a simple, user-
friendly method for tracking
exercise, and My Fitness Pal is
an accurate tool for monitoring
caloric intake and expenditure.
Plus, they're free-
But again, these little buttons
still won't jump out of the touch
screen and drag us to the gym or
force broccoli down our throats.
If we really want to change our
health and fitness habits, it takes
urgency and actionbeyond a
quick tap and drag. And if you're
looking for an "apple" you can
rely on to make a difference, it's
the one on your plate.

LSA sophomore Supreet Grewal reads in the open mic portion of the grand slam.

POETRY SLAM
From Page 2B
While the artform has a rich
history and is nationally recog-
nized and supported, it's never-
theless held in low opinion by a lot
of people. Undouhtedly, this has
played a role in the lack of partici-
pation at U-M Poetry.
"There are a lot of misconcep-
tions about what spoken word and
slam poetry is," said LSA sopho-
more Supreet Grewal. "A lot of
people think it's just very angry
and not something that's relatable
on a mass scale."
Grewal is a member of U-M
Poetry, and has helped Pan in the
revitalization effort. Having also
joined last year, her experiences
with the group were also on the

shaky side.
Pan had a particularly personal
interaction with the bad reputa-
tion slam poetry has garnered. At
one of the events hosted by U-M
Poetry, a performance showcase at
U-Mix Late Night, Pan gave a per-
formance and then opened up the
forum to discussion.
"What ended up happening is,
this one girl in particular, I'm not
going to go into details ... but she
ended up just saying that slam/spo-
ken word is shit poetry," Pan said.
"While that is her opinion and (she
is) entitled to that, I think that is a
very close-minded thing to say."
Pan's first encounter with the
medium was a transformative
experience. Originally, he was pri-
marily interested in short fiction.
That is, until he went to a slam his
sophomore year.
"I went to a poetry event and I

was blown away at how moving it
was for me," Pan said. "The per-
former that was there, his name
was Jon Sands, and he was so ani-
mated and so lively that he cap-
tured everyone's attention. ... His
performance was reallyrealto me,
and I think I wanted to do some-
thing like that."
Over the past summer, Pan and
Grewal worked with faculty in
the CCI for guidance and ideas,
which they then implemented last
'semester. Their efforts paid off.
The attendance numbers rise with
each event.
"We really got this off the
ground," Pan said. "It's great to see
something so alive again."
Some of the changes they've
made involve a greater push in
advertising, as well as a turn to
more local tastes in the guest
poets featured after the slam.
"Last semester, all ofour (guest)
poets were either in the Master of
Fine Arts program or from the
Ann Arbor area," Pan said. "They
studied under Jeff Kass in high
school and whatever college they
may have gone to, Ann Arbor was
where they were from, so that was
pretty cool that we got a lot of local
talent. That was reallybig.".
At Saturday's performance, Pan
brought in his good friend Mike
Rosen from New York to emcee
the event. Rosen attended the Uni-
versity his freshman year, where
he was first introduced to slam at
a U-Club Poetry event.
"I did not actually participate,
but I do very distinctly remem-

ber coming to this very room and
watching my first poetry slam,"
Rosen said.
Rosen would go on to start the
slam poetry program at Wesleyan
University, and has been hosting
slams on the college circuit ever
since. His experience was notice-
able.
His energy was palpable, and
with his confidence, humor and
charm, Rosen shaped the audi-
ence into an energetic slam
crowd, which was fitting, since a
big theme of the night was first-
times with the slam scene. Among
the members of U-M Poetry, you
could hear the audience's surprise
at all the new faces coming in.
"I want people who are in my

shoes to be able to find the water
instead of aimlessly searching
around like I did until my sopho-
more year, when I could have
started my freshman year," Pan
said.
The efforts to bring in these
new faces has led to a commu-
nity outreach beyond the Uni-
versity, where there is a thriving'
slam scene channeled from the
high schools such as Pioneer and
Huron, and The Neutral Zone, a
teen center on East Washington.
Pan has even gone so far as to
give a guest lecture at his old high
school in Troy, Mich., encourag-
ing the kids to explore forms of
poetic expression other than the
typical authors and styles listed

in curriculums. He would later
see some of these students at U-M
Poetry events.
- The revitalization efforts
haven't stopped at the success in
attendance, though. Pan, Grewal
and others at U-M Poetry want
to start offering workshops and
other events that create a comfort-
able space for those who might
otherwise pass up on the poetic
endeavor.
"The future is more workshops.
It is not worrying about budget.
It's not worrying about atten-
dance. It's not worrying about
these things; (it's) about having
everything clear and laid out and
focusing on how we getbetter and
where does the fun come in."

Since the club's revitalization, attendance numbers at U-M Poetry slam events and competitions have steadily increased.
