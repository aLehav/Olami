Engineering 
sophomore 
Conner Hein, who studies 
Electrical 
Engineering 
and 
Computer 
Science, 
went 
into 
backpacking 
for 
next 
semester’s classes with a plan. 
When 
his 
registration 
period rolled around, however, 
Hein realized the classes he 
wanted had already been filled 

to capacity. He found himself 
number 40 and number 60 
on two waitlists, which as of 
Tuesday night are both around 
a hundred students long.
Because of lengthy waitlists 
for most of the upper-level 
computer science classes he 
is interested in taking, Hein 
said his experience registering 
for classes has been a “battle 
of 
lowering 
expectations.” 
Though 
upper-level classes 

are important for students to 
find an area to specialize in, 
Hein explained he has instead 
had to settle for whatever 
classes he can get into.
“I’m in a situation where I’m 
taking absolutely minimum 
credit trying to get by, and 
even if you do get into upper-
level CS classes, they’re not 
the ones you want,” Hein said. 
“It feels like you’re not coming 
here for the reason you came 

here for.” 
The University of Michigan’s 
computer science program is 
consistently 
ranked 
among 
the best programs across the 
country. Over the last five to 10 
years, the University’s EECS 
department, 
particularly 
the 
Computer 
Science 
Engineering sub-department, 
has seen immense growth.

About 
40 
University 
of 
Michigan students gathered 
in the Ross School of Business 
Tuesday night to hear about 
the ways in which businesses 
can achieve carbon neutrality 
on campus.
Before 
the 
start 
of 
the 
event, Business senior Jennifer 
Maiorana described how she and 
fellow students from Net Impact, 
an organization focused on social 
and 
environmental 
change, 
were determined to organize 

this event. She said she was 
thrilled to have panelists speak 
to students who represented 
different disciplines.
The panel of four began by 
answering a series of questions 
about carbon neutrality from 
student moderators of Net 
Impact.
Stephen Forrest, one of the 
co-chairs 
of 
the 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality, said if even a small 
number of individuals adjusted 
their everyday activities to reduce 
their carbon footprint, society 
could potentially begin to take 
steps toward carbon neutrality. 

Forrest told the audience he 
walks four miles round-trip 
to work every day in an effort 
to reduce his own carbon 
footprint. 
“It’s all about the culture,” 
Forrest said. “We have to 
come up with an economically 
justifiable and equitable plan 
to get us to carbon neutrality.” 
Joe Trumpey, Art & Design 
associate professor, said his 
primary 
concern 
regarding 
carbon neutrality is urgency, 
specifically 
the 
speed 
at 
which society takes care of 
the issue of carbon footprint 
effects. He said reducing one’s 

meat consumption is a key 
way to work toward carbon 
neutrality.
“The number one thing you 
can do for carbon (neutrality) 
is 
to 
reduce 
your 
meat 
consumption,” Trumpey said. 
In 
a 
section 
of 
student 
questions, Jennifer Haverkamp, 
the other co-chair of the PCCN, 
said the city of Ann Arbor is 
developing an independent plan 
to achieve carbon neutrality, 
and the University is partnering 
with them to find a solution. 

Latinidad 
Magazine 
launched its seventh edition, 
Nuestra Música, at Trotter 
Multicultural Center Tuesday. 
More than 50 people attended 
the event, sponsored by Arts 
at Michigan, the Department 
of American Culture and the 
Residential College.
Issues are published every 
month of the fall and winter 
semesters. 
Editor 
in 
Chief 
Emmanuel Solis and Co-Editor 
Maria Sobrino, who writes for 
The Michigan Daily’s News 
section, moderated the event. 
In 
Latinidad 
Magazine’s 
second year of production, 
Nuestra Música explored the 
theme of music and how it fits 
into the Latinx community. The 
literary magazine consists of a 
playlist, poems and illustrations 
submitted 
by 
University 
students. Their mission is to be 
a platform for Latinx students at 
the University to reclaim their 
voice and foster representation 
within their community. 
Solis said the concept of 
music and identity was not the 
intended theme, but it ended up 
being a great idea.

University 
of 
Michigan 
students involved in the Don’t 
Leave Us Behind Campaign 
have taken action to advocate 
against a controversial state 
reading law.
The legislation, dubbed the 
“Read by Grade Three Law,” 
requires 
Michigan 
schools 
to identify students who are 
struggling with reading and 
writing to provide additional 
support with the potential to 
be held back in third grade. 
This school year is the first 
with the retention mandate in 
effect, requiring students who 
score below a certain cutoff 
on the Michigan Student Test 
of Educational Progress to be 
held back.
According 
to 
Rackham 
student Gabriel DellaVecchia, 
one of the founders of Don’t 
Leave Us Behind, the campaign 
has determined that about 
5,000 third grade students who 
would be held back each year 
under the law. DellaVecchia, 
who taught with Denver Public 
Schools before coming to the 
University, said Colorado and 
other states have these policies 
in place, though the retention 
component is optional. 

At 
this 
week’s 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Central 
Student 
Government meeting, Assembly 
members 
discussed 
supporting 
Iraqi refugees and CSG finances. 
Tuesday’s meeting was the last 
scheduled for the fall 2019 semester.
The 
meeting 
began 
with 
community 
member 
Kate 
Stenvig, a representative from fhe 
Coalition to Defend Affirmative 
Action, Integration & Immigrant 
Rights, and Fight for Equality By 
Any Means Necessary, urging the 
Assembly to bring attention to the 
upcoming trial of Ali Al-Sadoon 
and Wisam Hamana. Stenvig 
was joined by two of Al-Sadoon’s 
children, who also addressed the 
Assembly. 
Stenvig told the story of 
Al-Sadoon and Hamana, two 
Iraqi refugees who were arrested 
in July after cutting off their 

restraints and refusing to comply 
with Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement’s orders to arrive 
at the airport for deportation to 
Iraq. Al-Sadoon and Hamana 
were charged with hampering a 
deportation but plead not guilty.
Stenvig explained how those 
who are deported to Iraq are not 
provided with any identification 
or assistance finding housing or 
other resources. Stenvig said this 
can create a dangerous situation 
for those deported. 
“There is a lot of suspicion,” 
Stenvig 
said. 
“There’s 
1,500 
checkpoints in Baghdad alone, 
and if you’re going to a checkpoint 
and you’re an American... it’s 
kind 
of 
common 
knowledge 
you’re going to be under a lot 
of suspicion by the police, by 
different militias, and so to not 
have identification is really really 
dangerous.”

In 
early 
December, 
Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer announced 
the 
“Governor’s 
FAFSA 
Challenge” 
for 
high 
schools 
across the state to increase their 
Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid completion rate 
among graduating seniors. 
The challenge is supported 
by the College Cash Campaign 
initiative under Michigan College 
Access Network, which will 
provide the necessary resources, 
such 
as 
an 
implementation 
guide and toolbox of tips, to help 
participating high schools boost 
their FAFSA completion rate. 
MCAN is aiming for a 75 
percent FAFSA completion rate 
in 2020, a significant jump from 
the 55.9 percent completion rate 
in 2019. 
“Every student deserves a 
path to a quality, affordable 
postsecondary education, and 

filling out FAFSA forms can 
make an enormous difference 
for families across the state,” 
Whitmer said in a press release 
announcing 
the 
challenge. 
“I just finished helping my 
daughter fill out her FAFSA 
application while she applied to 
colleges. It’s simple and can help 
students everywhere get on a 
path to a quality postsecondary 
education.”
Completing the FAFSA online 
form is the only way to secure Pell 
Grants and other federal financial 
aid, as well as most state and 
institutional financial aid. Last 
year, it is estimated that about 
25,000 Michigan students who 
were eligible for the Pell Grant, 
a federal subsidy for college 
distributed to students based on 
need, did not file the FAFSA. That 
means nearly $100 million in Pell 
Grant funding went unused in 
the state of Michigan alone. 
MCAN will work with the 
estimated 
500 
participating 

high schools November through 
March on completing the FAFSA 
and 
scholarship 
applications. 
High schools will be able to 
track their FAFSA completion 
rate through the FAFSA tracker, 
which 
shows 
the 
individual 
school’s completion data and 
trends over time. 
The 
“Governor’s 
FAFSA 
Challenge” includes incentives 
and awards for high schools 
that reach certain levels of 
FAFSA completion. The three 
winning 
high 
schools 
will 
have the opportunity to have 
Whitmer, 
Lieutenant 
Gov. 
Garlin Gilchrist II or another 
prominent Michigan celebrity to 
serve as their commencement, 
or decision day, speaker. The top 
10 geographic winners will win 
a trip to the Capitol and meet 
Whitmer. 
FAFSA completion rates are 
lower in low-income districts 
than in high-income districts, 
according 
to 
College 
Cash 
Campaign. 
Low-income 
high school seniors are 127 
percent more likely to enroll 
in postsecondary education 
after high school if they 
complete the FAFSA than if 
they do not complete it. 
In a statement to The 
Michigan 
Daily, 
Vickie 
Crupper, 
senior 
associate 
director 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
Financial 
Aid 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
said the University’s FAFSA 
completion rates are already 
extremely 
high 
among 
incoming students. 
“Anything done to increase 
access to higher education, 
especially for those from 
low-income backgrounds, is a 
positive step, and we applaud 
the 
governor’s 
initiative,” 
Crupper said. “At U-M we’re 
lucky to have extremely high 
FAFSA 
completion 
rates 
among 
our 
students 
and 
families with need.”
Rackham student Laura 
Rall is president of Affordable 
Michigan, 
a 
student 
organization that works to 

alleviate some of the financial 
barriers to college life, including 
housing, health, food security 
and worker’s rights. 
Rall is from a small rural town 
in Van Buren County, Michigan, 
and believes the “Governor’s 
FAFSA Challenge” is a great 
initiative for encouraging high 
school students to complete the 
FAFSA. She recalled from her 
own experience that her high 
school left students to navigate 
the FAFSA completion process by 
themselves. 
“Because there was no FAFSA 
day at school or anything, if U-M 
hadn’t asked me to fill it out, I 
would never have thought to,” 
Rall said.

Rall said that living in a rural 
area presents other challenges 
to 
applying 
to 
college 
and 
completing the FAFSA, including 
internet 
access 
and 
parent 
availability. 
“Especially coming from my 
lens of a small community and 
an under-resourced community 
… Wi-Fi isn’t a widespread thing, 
just because it’s hard to get Wi-Fi 
in the country, just access to a 
computer to be able to fill out 
that information,” Rall said. “And 
then FAFSA is also relying on a 
parent being around and being 
able to answer the questions for 
you, which is hard with working 
schedules.” 
Given 
its 
high 
FAFSA 
completion 
rates, 
Rall 
said 
the University could increase 
accessibility by recruiting from 
high schools in lower-income and 
rural areas. 
“I know it would be hard for 
U-M to go to all of the different 
schools,” Rall said. “Even just in 
Michigan there’s so many, and a 
lot are spread apart. But I think 
it means a lot, especially when 
you’re a high school or teenage 
student to have someone tell 
you face to face that this is a 
possibility for you.”

Students numb from presidential election coverage

Dec. 11, 2000
While the media, obsessed 
by 
post-presidential 
election coverage, continue 
to indulge political junkies 
with 24-hour election news 
updates, most students are 
now spending their time 
obsessing about final exams 
and term papers
In most other years the 
presidential election would 
have ended more than a 
month ago, but this year’s 
historic counts, recounts 
– 
and 
then 
even 
more 
recounts – are driving some 
students batty.
Many students say they 

don’t have time to pay 
attention, 
while 
others 
simply have lost interest.
“I just want it to be 
decided. 
I 
don’t 
really 
care who gets it,” LSA 
sophomore Michelle Brown 
said 
while 
studying 
at 
Starbucks Coffee on South 
State Street.
“I would kind of just like 
to see it end. It’s making a big 
debacle,” Business School 
senior Kirk Oldford said, 
adding that he has stopped 
paying as much attention to 
every new detail reported 
by the news. “It’s not that I 
don’t care. It;s just going to 

be the same thing over and 
over again. I’m just waiting 
for the end to see what 
happens.”
Proofreading 
a 
paper 
at Angell Hall was more 
important to Oldford that 
focusing 
on 
the 
events 
in 
Florida. 
He 
said 
he 
consistently pays attention 
to general news events, and 
for him the election has 
become just another story. 
But with finals just around 
the corner, study mode has 
set in.
While sitting at an Angell 
Hall computer finishing one 
of his last assignments for 

the semester, Engineering 
senior K. Mannah Kallon 
said he does not believe the 
outcome of the election will 
affect his life.
But Kallon doesn’t care 
what happens in Florida 
and the possibility that Vice 
President Al Gore could 
win the popular vote but 
lose the Electoral College 
has made him disillusioned 
with the system.
“I don’t really care, I 
don’t 
particularly 
have 
strong feelings for either 
candidate,” Kallon said.
Many students do not 
deny the importance of this 

historic election but remain 
critical towards the media’s 
treatment of the election.
“It;s a shame that it’s 
taken up so much of the 
media’s 
attention 
that 
we’ve forgotten there are 
lots of things going on in 
the world right now,” Social 
Work student Carrie Gorga 
said. 
Gorga 
said 
she 
is 
disappointed 
that 
news 
services 
are 
neglecting 
to discuss possible voting 
problems in states other 
than Florida.
“They’ve totally ignored 
the rest of the country,” she 

said, arguing that there are 
disenfranchisement issues 
the media has neglected.
Gorga 
described 
the 
events in Florida as “a 
circus,” saying that she 
believes while the election 
is important, she does not 
understand the need for 
24-hour coverage.
“We’ve got a whole other 
month until somebody is 
sworn in, so I don’t see 
what’s the rush,’ Gorga 
said.

Enticed by the potential of a 
six-figure salary out of college 
in 
a 
booming 
job 
market, 
more 
students 
nationally 
are 
interested 
in 
studying 
computer science, including the 
University. In under a decade, 
the number of students who 
have declared a CSE major has 
more than quadrupled, from 
317 students in fall 2010 to 1,320 
students in fall 2019. In that 
same time-frame, enrollment 
in the LSA computer science 
major has increased more than 
16 times, from 43 students in fall 
2010 to 719 students in fall 2019.
The increase of students in 
the major has translated to an 
increase of students enrolled 
in various computer science 
courses. For instance, EECS 
281, a prerequisite course to 
most upper-level EECS classes, 
has seen substantial growth. 
According to data shared with 
The Daily by Steven Crang, CSE 
Manager for Communications 
and Marketing, 386 students 
took the class in the 2010-
2011 school-year, while 1,409 
students were enrolled in the 
class in the 2018-2019 school-
year.
This 
data 
reflects 
an 
occupational 
landscape 
in 
which 
a 
computer 
science 
degree is more in demand than 
ever. Despite the fact that the 
number of U.S. undergraduates 
majoring in computer science 
has more than doubled from 
2013 to 2017, research suggests 
the number of computer science-
related jobs still “far outpaces” 
the number of students with 
bachelor degrees in the subject. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor 
Statistics, 
employment 
for computer and information 
research scientists is projected 
to grow 16 percent from 2018 to 
2028, which is “much faster than 
the average for all occupations.”
In trying to keep up with 
increasing demand for computer 
science 
education, 
the 
CSE 
department at the University has 

ramped up hiring new faculty as 
well. In fact, Crang’s data shows 
the CSE department has grown 
by almost 40 percent in the last 
five 
years. 
The 
department, 
which had 50 tenure track 
professors and eight lecturers 
in fall 2013, has expanded to 
60 tenure track faculty and 20 
lecturers in fall 2019. 
Peter Chen, the CSE Chief 
Program Advisor and a professor 
in the EECS department, said 
the 
department 
has 
worked 
hard to hire more faculty. Chen 
explained 
the 
department 
has also hired more adjunct 
instructors, 
sometimes 
graduate students, who are not 
permanent 
faculty 
members. 
However, he said it is difficult, 
if not impossible, to hire more 
instructors at the rate of growth 
in student enrollment, especially 
as other universities and high-
paying jobs in the private sector 
compete for many of the same 
qualified candidates.
Chen 
explained 
the 
department’s main initiative 
has been to increase class 
sizes 
dramatically. 
While 
upper-level classes used to 
have about 20 to 50 students 
to 
one 
instructor, 
classes 
have now ballooned to 150 to 
200 students to increase the 
availability of these classes.
However, Chen, who also 
teaches 
upper-level 
EECS 
classes, noted there comes a 
tradeoff with increasing the 
student-to-teacher ratio.
“That’s probably not great for 
students or teachers, because 
it’s really hard at that scale to 
give adequate attention to each 
student, which you’d like to as 
a teacher, and I think students 
would like as well,” Chen said.
To increase class availability, 
Chen explained certain classes 
have 
begun 
experimenting 
with online-only sections in 
which students watch lecture 
recordings instead of attending 
lectures 
in 
a 
designated 
classroom. 
Yet, 
with 
this 
solution, the department should 
remember that the University is 
not an online-only college, Chen 
said. 

At 
the 
same 
time, 
Chen 
explained 
the 
department 
has tried to limit demand for 
computer 
science 
classes. 
Recently, the department limited 
students to only registering for 
two upper-level EECS classes 
at a time, which Chen said has 
extended opportunity for those 
who register later in the process. 
In addition, enrollment in these 
classes are prioritized for majors 
and minors of computer science 
who need them to graduate.
Despite 
these 
reforms, 
students who recently registered 
for their next semester classes 
have still experienced waitlists 
that have hundreds of people. As 
one post in a University student 
Facebook group noted, waitlists 
are sometimes a similar size to 
that of the class itself. 
According 
to 
Rackham 
student Sharang Karve, a first-
year student in the College of 
Engineering, the problem is 
further exacerbated as students 
feel compelled to register for 
more classes than they intend on 
taking.
“If you don’t get into a 
certain class, you waitlist for 
two others,” Karve said. “Now, 
when you waitlist for two others, 
that’s blocking another person 
to register for that class… It’s a 
snowball effect. They don’t really 
know which ones they’re going 
to get into, so the blanket answer 
is to waitlist for everything and 
just hope you get into one.”
The 
University 
course 
registration 
system 
assigns 
students a time to register 
based on the number of credits 
they have, so students with 
the most credits register first. 
However, a recent op-ed in The 
Daily has argued this system 
favors students from better-
resourced high schools, where 
students have more access and 
support in taking Advanced 
Placement and International 
Baccalaureate classes, and thus 
arrive at the University with 
more college credit.

“won’t you celebrate with 
me
what i have shaped into
a kind of life?” - Lucille 
Clifton
When I joined Michigan 
in Color in 2018, my goal 
was to find the language 
to describe my identity 
as 
a 
Black 
woman 
for 
myself. I wanted to be 
liberated from internalized 
misconceptions 
and 
controlling images that had 
left my self-determination 
stifled and misaligned. It 
is through Michigan in 
Color that I discovered the 
inherent beauty, joy and 
brilliancy in my Blackness. 
Thus, it has been one of 
my 
greatest 
honors 
to 
have been able to serve as 
Co-Managing 
Editor 
for 
Michigan in Color. As MiC 
has helped me cultivate my 
narrative, voice, purpose 
and self-love, I am thankful 
to have been a part of a 
platform that has helped 
others shape theirs. 
To my Podcast, Blog, and 
Creative Content Editors: I 
am in awe of what you have 
been able to accomplish. 
From the creation of the 
Creative 
column, 
our 
podcast and the expansion 
of 
the 
blog, 
I 
am 
so 
incredibly proud of your 
vision and direction. You 
have been instrumental in 

expanding 
Michigan 
in 
Color beyond the written 
page 
and 
increasing 
methods of self-expression. 
I hope that you all continue 
to foster your imagination 
and creativity and that you 
never stop pushing your 
ideas into reality. 
To the editors of the 
column: You have all been 
such a delight, and your 
hard work has not gone 
unnoticed. You all have 
been so amazing in helping 
us to continue the mission 
of our section. Each and 
every single one of you has 
expanded the capacity of 
Michigan in Color to serve 
students of color, and I will 
be forever thankful for your 
flexibility, dedication, and 
commitment.
To 
my 
wonderful, 
intelligent, 
beautiful 
Co-Managing Editor Carly: 
Thank you for everything. 
More than I can express, 
you are what has kept 
me solid throughout this 
journey. 
Your 
kindness, 
direction, 
and 
diligence 
is 
admirable, 
and 
the 
section is so lucky to have 
flourished 
under 
your 
leadership. In addition to 
being the best co-Managing 
Editor that I could have 
ever asked for, you have 
become such a dear friend 
to me, and I genuinely will 
miss the sliver of peace that 
you brought for me every 
Sunday. 

Lastly, 
to 
the 
new 
Managing 
Editors 
of 
Michigan in Color Maya 
and Ana: I am so incredibly 
excited 
about 
your 
leadership and visions for 
the section. You two were 
meant for this position, and 
I am confident that MiC is 
in powerful, capable hands. 
Know that my faith in you 
will never falter and that I 
will be supporting you for 
days and days to come. 
The Daily has become 
a second home, and I will 
remember it fondly for all 
of the laughs, challenges, 
and innovation that has 
come from its walls. It is 
such an honor to have been 
able to contribute to the 
legacy of the Daily and its 
commitment to journalistic 
freedom. The students here 
have all inspired me so 
much, and it is through the 
leadership and fellowship 
that I’ve witnessed from 
others that I have begun to 
believe in myself. 
Michigan in Color, you 
have been both the ends and 
the beginnings of my weeks 
for the longest that I can 
remember. You have been 
both the solace after a busy 
week and a burst of energy 
for 
the 
coming 
weeks’ 
trials. As MiC strives to 
amplify the voices of people 
of color, I look forward to 
carrying this commitment 
with me for decades to 
come.

There’s 
a 
unique 
vulnerability in attaching 
your name to words, having 
them printed 7,500 times 
and distributed to every 
building on campus. Even 
though I’ve done this nearly 
100 times in my four years 
here, as I sit writing for the 
Daily one last time, I can tell 
you it never gets easier.
But I sure have grown up 
since Emma Kinery assigned 
me my first story and set 
my world in motion. I’ve 
come a long way since being 
that shamelessly try-hard 
freshman: running down to 
the South Quad lobby to pick 
up a paper each morning, 
taking three shaky breaths 
before 
calling 
a 
source, 
wanting so badly to do right 
by the stories I had been 
awarded the privilege to tell. 
In time, I became one of 
the editors who basically 
lived in this building, who 
finally found out what the 
heck MDesk is, who was 
pulled into the time warp 
that is making a newspaper, 
emerging at 12 a.m. with the 
distinctly shrill headache 
that can only be produced by 
the sports section’s playlist, 
and who complained about 
my job, but only because that 
was easier than explaining 
how I could possibly enjoy 
spending 20+ hours in the 
newsroom every week. 
But it hasn’t been without 
sacrifice. 
By 
pouring 
myself into 420 Maynard, 
I 
neglected 
friendships, 
requested (and was denied) 
countless essay extensions, 
strained relationships and 
ceded many good night’s 
sleeps. I’ve stuttered through 

innumerable 
interviews, 
laid awake thinking about 
typos, cried in every room in 
this building, and somehow 
attracted the attention of 
Steve from Utah, who for a 
time left angry comments on 
each one of my articles.
But here, I found purpose 
and community. The work 
I’ve done at the Daily has 
felt more meaningful and 
productive than any other 
assignment I can think of. 
This place really is a means 
to make great change. If you 
have a story to tell, the Daily 
will listen. 
I have no idea what a 
college 
experience 
looks 
like without this place, but 
I take comfort in knowing 
the 
Daily 
is 
evergreen. 
More women of color will 
take up space above the 
fold. More articles will hold 
the powerful accountable 
and give a platform to the 
overlooked. More freshmen 
will trudge up the steps of 
the newsroom bewildered, 
ambitious, 
and 
unaware 
they’re about to take on the 
most rewarding experience 
of their lives. I can’t wait to 
read what they have to say. 
To those that made this 
place a home, Boo Boo, 
Kaela, Sophie, Matt, Maya 
and Riyah, you guys are 
some of the most formative 
friends I’ve ever had. I still 
can’t believe we did that. It 
was so crazy and so special. 
We made a really good team. 
To 
my 
dumplings, 
you’re truly the cool older 
girlfriends I always wanted 
to make in college. I don’t 
know who I would be if 
you hadn’t taken me under 
your fashionable, graceful, 
uncommonly literate wings, 
and I don’t ever want to find 

out. 
To 
Na’kia, 
you’re 
something so special and 
everyone who meets you can 
feel it. I really can’t imagine 
a better leader or a more 
loyal friend. It’s me and you 
forever.
To the MiC staff, the work 
you did this year mattered. I 
can’t thank you enough for 
your diligence, your words 
and your hugs. 
To 
all 
of 
this 
year’s 
managing editors, I’m not 
sure in what other context a 
ragtag bunch of individuals 
like us would be found in the 
same room, but somehow, it 
really worked. Thank you for 
being so fearless and fun in 
taking on what was probably 
the craziest learning curve 
we’ve ever encountered. The 
result was extraordinary.
To Finny and Maxy, as 
our very own Joel once said, 
“The Michigan Daily really 
has some of the best white 
men out there.” You guys are 
the best of the best. To Joel, 
there’s no one I’d rather be 
canceled with. Thank you 
for always knowing just how 
to make me laugh. Tuesday 
nights were always the best 
part of my week. To Maggie, 
for always being 100 percent 
true to yourself –– no matter 
how uncomfortable it made 
people. You light up every 
room you walk into. Just 
don’t go wearing too many 
skirts, especially in front 
of 
[redacted]. 
To 
Maya, 
everytime I think about 
our friendship for too long 
I cry, so I’ll just say thank 
you for growing up with me. 
I’ll be here from 5th Bush to 
beyond.
420 
Maynard, 
there’s 
nothing like you. Thank you, 
again and again.

Michigan in Color

“Denver Public Schools, as a 
district, said they didn’t believe 
in retention, so they actually 
had a letter that we could share 
with families and say, it is the 
guidance of the district that 
retention is not the best option 
to help support your child in 
reading,” 
DellaVecchia 
said. 
“In my three years of teaching 
in Colorado, not a single family 
in my classroom, and as far as 
I know, not a single family and 
my school, selected retention for 
their child.”
The law has drawn controversy 
since it was passed by former Gov. 
Rick Snyder and a Republican-
controlled state legislature in 
2016. 
While 
proponents 
say 
it sets a standard to ensure 
students do not fall behind and 
receive the support they need, 
critics note research indicating 
negative psychological and social 
impacts of retention on children, 
in addition to the added costs to 
the government. 
Among 
the 
Michigan 
law’s critics are current Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat 
who has advocated repealing 
it, 
and 
Detroit 
Community 
School District Superintendent 
Nicholai Vitti, as well as State 
Superintendent Michael Rice, 
who has called it a “bad law.”
Though only 5 percent of 
third graders are expected to be 
retained under the policy, there 
have been concerns from Vitti 
and members of the Don’t Leave 
Us Behind campaign regarding 
the varying performance levels 
across school districts. DCSD, 
for example, would have had 20 
percent of its third graders held 
back — approximately four times 
the state average. DellaVecchia 
said beyond the impacts on 
students, the law could require 
schools to make staffing changes 
based on the number of students 
being retained.
LSA senior Ariella Meltzer 
said she originally found the 
campaign through the Roosevelt 
Institute and was particularly 
struck by how clearly the data 
showed the policy impacting low-
income and minority populations 
in the state.
“What’s 
really 
harmful 
about the law is that it hugely 

disproportionately 
affects 
minority 
and 
low-income 
students in terms of retention,” 
Meltzer said. “All the research 
shows that it just has really bad 
effects all around. And when you 
combine that with the fact that 
you’re putting this extra burden 
on a school district or students 
that already face an incredible 
amount of hardships, such as 
in Detroit or Flint, I literally 
consider it a racist law. I think 
that the intention — in terms of 
getting students to reach, like, 
proficiency and literacy at an 
earlier age — is important and 
that’s 
something 
we 
should 
be working towards, but the 
execution of the law is really 
lacking.”
At least 25 states have similar 
legislation 
in 
place. 
Under 
Michigan’s version of the law, 
there are exemptions, though 
critics question if these favor 
those with the resources to 
obtain them. These “good faith 
exemptions” include students 
enrolled in special education 
with an individualized education 
plan, limited English with less 
than three years of instruction 
in an English language learner 
program 
and 
having 
been 
enrolled in their current school 
for less than two years with 
evidence they did not have an 
individual reading improvement 
plan. 
State Rep. Pamela Hornberger, 
R-District 32, an advocate of 
the law, did not respond to The 
Daily’s request for comment.
Test scores have shown more 
than half of Michigan third grade 
students test below proficient 
in reading. Those in favor of the 
policy, like former state Rep. 
Amanda Price, who sponsored 
the bill, have said it requires 
schools to focus on ensuring 
students can read.
Members of the Don’t Leave 
Us Behind Campaign point to 
research 
demonstrating 
the 
negative social and psychological 
impacts 
of 
retainment. 
For 
instance, 
students 
who 
are 
retained are more likely to drop 
out.
Though 
the 
campaign 
is 
against the bill in its entirety, 
DellaVecchia said their current 
goal is to get an amendment 
passed changing the retention 
component 
to 
optional. 
DellaVecchia 
said 
they 
are 

pushing for this change to allow 
families and teachers to make 
the decision rather than the 
government.
LSA 
junior 
Jordan 
Tyo 
said the coalition behind the 
campaign has been growing. The 
group has been meeting with 
lawmakers in Lansing, as well as 
trying to connect with parent-
teacher organizations and gain 
wider name recognition among 
parents.
While 
they 
have 
had 
difficulties 
reaching 
out 
to 
parents, the group has found 
success in getting the attention 
of state representatives, who 
largely ignored them when the 
campaign began.
“It’s 
surprising 
how 
ill-
informed parents are, not being 
any fault of their own or the 
school, it’s just that this bill 
kind of slid in there and, all of a 
sudden, it’s going to affect, and 
they still don’t completely know 
about it,” Tyo said. “It’s a little 
tedious trying to get in there 
and trying to expand, but it’s 
also kind of cool seeing just the 
grassroots going from hardly 
getting an answer to meeting 
with these representatives and 
really picking up momentum.”
In addition to lobbying policy 
makers, 
DellaVecchia 
said 
they have been meeting with 
community groups across the 
state to educate people on the 
law.
One roadblock they face is 
getting an amendment on the 
table to be voted on. DellaVecchia 
said the chairs of the House 
Education Reform Committee 
and 
the 
Senate 
Education 
Committees would have to bring 
the amendment to the floor, 
though they are not required to 
do so. DellaVecchia said he would 
not be surprised if they did not 
bring the amendment forward.
If 
they 
cannot 
get 
an 
amendment 
through 
soon, 
Meltzer said families across the 
state will bear the consequences 
as thousands of third graders 
this year are retained. With this 
in mind, she said the campaign is 
in a race against time.
“It is going to be really sad if 
we can’t get something to change 
to see the literal thousands of 
kids that are going to come home 
with this piece of paper that says 
your kid is going to be held back,” 
Meltzer said.

Handling mental health during the holidays

We must learn from #NousToutes

T

he 
holiday 
season 
is 
touted by society as the 
most wonderful time of 
the year. Cheerful music, cheesy 
movies and bright decorations 
abound as soon as Halloween 
passes. 
However, 
for 
many 
Americans, the holiday season is 
one to dread. Along with tidings 
of comfort and joy, the holidays 
bring the pressures of large family 
gatherings, parties among friends, 
an abundance of unhealthy foods 
and obligations to spend money 
on gifts. Coupled with the colder, 
darker weather, the onset of the 
holiday season can leave many 
feeling overwhelmed, anxious and 
depressed. Despite the crushing 
expectations to have fun and enjoy 
the merriment of the holidays, it is 
possible to survive the season with 
your sanity intact. 
There are a multitude of reasons 
why the holiday season is difficult 
for many. Some individuals and 
families find the holidays highlight 
the absence of loved ones they 
have lost, whether through death 
or some other means. An empty 
chair at a dinner table — a concrete 
reminder of a missing person 
— may be easier to look past at 
other times of the year. Moreover, 
holiday family gatherings can 
bring back painful memories of a 
departed person and times shared 
during happier seasons. To cope 
with the grief that accompanies 
the holidays, it is important to 
first consciously acknowledge that 
the season will be emotionally 
difficult. Grief is often a taboo 
subject, especially during the 
holidays. 
However, 
Rachel 
Thomas, president of OptionB, 
an organization that provides 
resources to those facing grief or 
other adversity, says social support 
can make all the difference to a 
grieving person. In order to best 
support someone in your life who 
is grieving, be sure to provide open 
invitations to holiday festivities, 
but do not pressure them into 
attendance if they seem unwilling. 
If you are able, gifting a donation in 
memory of the lost loved one may 
be a welcome gesture that provides 
comfort during a difficult season. 

Beyond grief, individuals with 
active eating disorders or those 
in recovery often experience an 
increase in their symptoms during 
the holiday season. As most of the 
major holidays — especially in the 
United States — center around 
food, people who struggle with 
anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating 
or other related disorders may 
feel a profound sense of panic. 
The prospect of eating under the 
watchful eyes of large groups 
of friends and family in social 
situations can cause many to fall 
further into patterns of disordered 
eating. Many people with anorexia 
in particular often do not know 
what a normal amount of food is for 
them and fear eating any amount 
will cause immediate weight gain. 
This fear is then compounded by 
the feeling that everyone nearby 
is watching and intensely judging 
the amount of food they are eating. 
When bulimia, the cycle of binge-
eating and purging, is involved, 
the abundance of food may 
present feelings of excitement and 
immense shame, as well as self-
hatred and fear over the prospect 
of their loved ones finding out 
about their struggles. The family 
and friends of someone struggling 
with 
disordered 
eating 
can 
provide support by refraining from 
commenting on their loved one’s 
food or their own eating habits 
during the holiday season. It can 
also be helpful to make time for 
holiday activities that do not focus 
on food, such as watching movies or 
singing carols. Most importantly, 
patience and kindness are integral 
to helping a loved one cope with 
their eating disorder throughout 
the holiday season. 
Anxiety and depression are 
often prevalent during the holidays 
as well. The demands of cooking, 
gift-buying, cleaning, throwing or 
attending parties and the overall 
pressure to “perform happiness” 
can be isolating. Furthermore, 
the looming new year can present 
feelings 
of 
inadequacy 
over 
lack of achievements of goals 
set at the start of the year. For 
many others, attending holiday 
parties full of coworkers, friends 

or 
family 
members 
presents 
crippling social anxiety and may 
increase feelings of isolation in 
those with depression. According 
to the Anxiety and Depression 
Association 
of 
America, 
de-stressing and handling holiday-
related depression can involve 
simple acts, such as avoiding the 
obligation to say yes to all holiday-
related gatherings you may be 
invited to, avoiding excessive use of 
alcohol or drugs and maintaining 
healthy habits through eating and 
other forms of self-care. 
The holiday season may be 
difficult 
even 
for 
individuals 
without 
diagnosed 
mental 
illnesses. Those with jobs in retail 
often find what is supposed to 
be a joyful time dampened by 
managing customers on their 
worst behavior. Others may find 
that the repetition of the same 
songs, movies and traditions grates 
on their sanity. If you find yourself 
among these groups, understand 
that such feelings are common. 
Northwestern Memorial Hospital 
psychiatrist Michael Ziffra, M.D. 
emphasizes the importance of 
skipping holiday activities that 
you do not enjoy. Alternatives 
include buying gifts online if you 
cannot stand crowded shopping 
malls. Because the holidays are 
often hectic and disruptive, it is 
important to stay as close to your 
normal schedule as possible to 
maintain some sort of normalcy, 
says Ziffra. Clinical psychologist 
John 
E. 
Mayer 
recommends 
setting aside a part of your holiday 
budget to buy yourself something 
you have wanted for some time as 
a means to ease the holiday blues. 
If you still find yourself struggling, 
reach out to a trusted loved one to 
confide your difficulties. The same 
goes for if you notice someone 
close to you seems to be having a 
hard time. Getting through the 
busy holiday season can seem 
impossible, but there are ways to 
manage the abundance of emotions 
that often surface around the end 
of the calendar year.

n France, one woman dies 
every two days from a man 
committing domestic violence. 
In the United States, three women 
die per day at the hands of men 
perpetrating domestic violence.
On Saturday, Nov. 23, about 
150,000 people across France — from 
Paris to Bordeaux to Lyon — gathered 
in protest of growing rates of femicide 
in France. Femicide is the killing of 
a woman or girl on account of her 
gender by a man. Since the start of 
2019, 137 women have died from 
gender-based violence in France.
The outrage over the rise in 
femicide in France was sparked by 
the murder of Julie Douib by her 
husband, Bruno Garcia Cruciani. 
Douib reported domestic violence to 
the French police over a dozen times, 
including an incident where she told 
police she was afraid her husband, 
who had a gun license, might shoot 
her. The police told her they could 
not do anything until her husband 
actually pointed a gun at her. Two 
days later, Douib’s husband shot and 
killed her. 
Douib’s murder was emblematic 
of the danger domestic violence poses 
to women and the obstacles women 
face when reporting violence to 
police. A French dialogue began and 
led to the #NousToutes movement, 
which organized the protests on 
Saturday. #NousToutes translates 
to “All of Us,” but takes the French 
feminine verb form, meaning “All of 
Us Women.” It was founded in the 
summer of 2019 as an extension of the 
#MeToo movement, or the French 
equivalent #BalanceTonPorc, to call 
attention to the widespread gender-
based violence men commit against 
women in France. This gender-based 
violence includes domestic abuse, 
domestic violence, sexual assault, 
rape and other forms of sexual 
violence. 
More than just a protest march, 
the 
#NousToutes 
grassroots 
movement has pushed change in 
France. Though French President 
Emmanuel Macron has failed to 
keep his promises of making gender 
equality the “great national cause,” 
 
the French government opened a 
national debate on gender-based 
violence and femicide. After Macron 
admitted on Facebook that France 
“couldn’t manage to protect” women 
from femicide and intimate-partner 

violence, he announced a three-
month series of conferences involving 
government 
officials, 
women’s 
rights groups, lawyers, prosecutors 
and victims’ families to work on 
preventing femicide and supporting 
domestic violence victims.
By some measures, domestic 
violence is more prevalent and 
destructive in the U.S. than in France, 
with 29 percent of American women 
experiencing physical violence by a 
partner compared to the 26 percent 
of French women. While France is 
taking steps to protect women from 
violent men, the U.S. seems to be 
ignoring the problem, which enables 
men to continue to abuse and violate 
women. Republicans in the U.S. are 
actively blocking a law designed to 
protect women and punish abusers of 
any gender. 
In 
the 
U.S. 
House 
of 
Representatives 
this 
year, 
157 
Republicans 
voted 
against 
reauthorizing the Violence Against 
Women Act (VAWA) at the urging of 
the National Rifle Association. The 
bill was first passed in 1994 as the 
first federal legal acknowledgement 
of domestic and sexual violence, 
making them crimes and providing 
federal assistance to combat violence 
against women. While the VAWA 
Reauthorization did ultimately pass 
the House, the Republican-controlled 
Senate, led by Sen. Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., has refused to even take a vote 
on the bill. 
While the VAWA Reauthorization 
is important for addressing gender-
based violence in the U.S., it seems 
it will be stalled in the Senate until 
Democrats gain a majority, which 
is unlikely to happen soon given 
Republican voter suppression efforts.
In the meantime, feminists and 
activists can work to gain support 
for the Equal Rights Amendment, 
which has renewed hopes for passage 
after Democrats gained a majority in 
the Virginia House of Delegates in 
the 2019 election. The Equal Rights 
Amendment, proposed in 1923 by the 
National Women’s Party, is “designed 
to guarantee equal legal rights for 
all American citizens regardless of 
sex.” The amendment attempts to 
end legal distinctions between men 
and women regarding elements like 
divorce, property and employment.
The main clause of the ERA states, 
“Equality of rights under the law 

shall not be denied or abridged by 
the United States or by any state on 
account of sex.” The U.S. Constitution 
does not promote this. 
Passed by the U.S. House of 
Representatives in 1972 and similarly 
ignored by the Senate, the ERA was 
ratified by 35 states, falling three 
states short of the required 38 before 
a 1982 deadline. It failed, in part, 
because of the efforts of conservative 
activist and strident anti-feminist 
Phyllis Schafly.
In 2017, Nevada became the 36th 
state to ratify the ERA, and one year 
later, Illinois became the 37th. While 
many express concerns these efforts 
might be in vain, some legal scholars 
question if the House had the 
authority to place a deadline on the 
amendment in the first place. Even 
if a court rules it did, then the House 
also has the authority to remove 
the original 1982 deadline. With a 
Democratic majority in the House, 
the ERA could therefore be passed 
in 2020, which also happens to be the 
100th anniversary of the Nineteenth 
Amendment.
While the ERA is not specifically 
aimed at ameliorating domestic 
violence, a constitutional guarantee 
that rights cannot be abridged on the 
basis of sex can force law enforcement 
to protect women against domestic 
violence. In the 2005 case Town 
of Castle Rocks v. Gonzales, the 
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 
Fourteenth Amendment does not 
compel state law enforcement to 
enforce restraining orders protecting 
women against domestic violence. 
The ERA could fix this.
The 
U.S. 
desperately 
needs 
to 
address 
domestic 
violence, 
particularly that of men who commit 
violence against women. Domestic 
violence also affects men, though at 
far lower rates, and is not exclusive 
to heterosexual relationships. In 
the U.S., nearly one in three women 
and one in nine men will experience 
rape, physical violence or stalking by 
a partner. 
The U.S. should emulate the 
French #NousToutes movement. 
Like France, we have a domestic 
violence epidemic. Passing the Equal 
Rights Amendment is the first legal 
step to ending it.

The toxicity of American holiday traditions
T

hanksgiving was first 
celebrated in the late 19th 
century. It embraces a 
whitewashed history of Native 
Americans sitting down happily 
with the Pilgrims to celebrate a 
successful year of harvest, and most 
importantly, life. The story touts 
that the Native Americans taught 
the Pilgrims how to hunt turkey 
and plant corn, and with their 
freshly harvested crops and fire-
roasted bird, everyone celebrated 
and feasted together. This joyous 
ideal is what we are taught all 
throughout 
elementary 
school, 
something consequently ingrained 
in our consciousness. It is explained 
that this holiday is a time for “giving 
thanks” and conscious cultural 
appropriation. In peppy, youthful 
classes all across America, students 
fashion feathered headdresses and 
jump around in circles, soon to sit 
down criss-cross applesauce and 
talk about how they’re thankful 
for their dog or mommy. For 
many Americans, Thanksgiving 
is a simple time to consume 
questionable turkey innards and 
steaming mashed potatoes and talk 
about “what they’re thankful for,” 
which usually involves a drowsy 
response of “each other.” However, 
for many others, Thanksgiving has 
a contentious history that goes far 
beyond the time the initial “feast” 
was held. 
Americans love traditions, but 
many are unaware of why these 
so-called traditions are so widely 
celebrated. For Native Americans, 
Thanksgiving is not a holiday 
synonymous with blessings, praise 
and gratitude. Instead, it is a 
reminder of the dark history of the 
past four centuries that is rarely 
told transparently. 
In his article, “Why I’m not 
Thankful 
for 
Thanksgiving,” 
Michael Dorris, an American 
novelist, scholar and member 
of 
the 
Modoc 
Tribe, 
wrote, 
“Considering that virtually none 
of the standard fare surrounding 
... Thanksgiving contains an ounce 
of authenticity, historical accuracy 
or cross-cultural perception, why 
is it so apparently ingrained? Is it 
necessary for the North American 
psyche to perpetually exploit and 
debase its victims in order to justify 
its history?”
At the whitewashed feast that is 
so well celebrated today, the sitting 
down and breaking of bread with 
Native Americans was a prelude to 
one of the worst acts of genocide in 
the history of our planet. America 
is built on an endless stream of 
broken promises from invaders 
who exploited and commiserated 
the indigenous people of the land 
they “founded.” With this in mind, 
let Natives express their trauma 
over “Thanksgiving” and genocide 
without tone policing them or 
reprimanding them on how they 
are “making others feel bad” about 
wanting to celebrate an entirely 
commercial holiday. Just as there 
was backlash against the movement 
to rename racist sports teams, such 
as the Washington Redskins, non-
Natives are uncomfortable when 
confronted with terrible histories 

of what America has done to its 
Native people. America is not losing 
its values because “friendsgiving” 
is becoming more popular than 
Thanksgiving; People are simply 
readjusting their priorities and 
realizing 
they 
don’t 
want 
to 
continue filling their lives with 
toxic bonds for the sake of the title 
“family.” 
Thanksgiving is steeped in 
tradition, and lately, this sense of 
tradition is being threatened for 
Americans who hold their familial 
ideations and ignorance so dearly. 
Although the concept of celebrating 
the holidays with your friends 
instead of family members has 
been around for decades, the term 
“friendsgiving” has been made 
more prevalent in recent years. 
Although it’s only a simple word-
change and still the same concept, 
some people are up in arms talking 
about how America is losing its 
values by embracing friendsgiving 
and negating Thanksgiving. A 
Huffington Post article even alleged 
that “it’s precisely the absence of 
any threat to life and limb that 
makes Friendsgiving such a fail.” 
It’s claimed that people would 
rather work or spend time with 
their friends than go home to 
spend time with family around the 
holidays. However, being able to 
denounce people who make these 
decisions comes from an inherent 
place of privileged family dynamics 
and a limited perspective. 

The holidays are a hard time for 
a countless number of people. Many 
do not have functional homes with 
happy, smiling family members to 
return to. Others may face a financial 
barrier and not be able to afford to 
travel hundreds of miles or take off 
work to see family members. Flights 
home are expensive, especially 
around the holiday season, and 
people may wonder if it’s worth 
it to spend entire paychecks to go 
home to a potentially miserable 
environment. 
Consequently, 
choosing to celebrate with loved 
ones who are geographically closer 
can avoid the anxiety caused by 
making these tough monetary 
decisions. Individuals may also 
not feel comfortable being around 
family members due to past 
traumas, 
differing 
political 
or 
emotional outlooks, homophobia, 
racism, overall bigotry and so on. 
Perhaps the reasoning behind not 
wanting to see family is simpler 
and someone just doesn’t want to 
answer all their aunts and uncles’ 
menacing questions or address 
“what can you do with an English 
degree?” Having a great family 

dynamic where you can spend 
every holiday together without 
it being chaotic, stressful and 
exhausting is fantastic. However, 
this environment isn’t the case for 
plenty of people, so friendsgiving 
and other friend-centered holiday 
celebrations are new trends that 
create comfortable dynamics that 
promote inclusion and mutual well-
being among loved ones. 
In the best-case scenario, we 
choose who has access to our time 
and space, especially during the 
holiday seasons. Between seasonal 
depression, toxic families and the 
looming possibility of the death of 
relatives, sometimes reintroducing 
yourself to a family environment 
after weeks away can be very 
challenging. If you must attend 
and you become uncomfortable 
due to your identification with a 
community that is being verbally 
harassed at a family outing, 
please know you deserve better 
and so many are supporting you 
walking out. Abusive families or 
family members that are cruel, 
unaccepting and bigoted do not 
have inherent value and do not 
need to be given time — if at all 
possible. Friendsgiving is all about 
choices, and people should not be 
shamed for choosing what sets 
them at peace. It’s about celebrating 
life with people you care about and 
vice versa, not people you should 
be forced to encounter. 
Commercially 
constructed 
holidays 
with 
centuries-
old, 
genocidal 
pretenses 
should be cut out altogether. 
Friendsgiving is an obvious 
substitute, 
and 
although 
it 
may be much healthier and 
enjoyable for many without 
functional, poster families, the 
whitewashed holiday seasons 
are still a constant and looming 
trauma 
for 
Native 
peoples. 
Although the holiday is toxic 
in a variety of ways, proper 
education 
in 
the 
genocidal 
history of this feast can allow 
people to remember the trauma 
of colonization on the Native 
Americans. Over the holidays, 
we can get together with loved 
ones to mourn those who were 
murdered and lost, as well as 
their centuries of traditions and 
sacred land, by acknowledging 
the true history of America and 
Thanksgiving while giving agency 
to Native Americans. I realize 
the centuries of stolen land and 
murder may be “hard to teach,” 
but it is necessary. If you are 
priviledged enough to celebrate 
the 
holidays 
with 
a 
happy, 
functional family, please take a 
moment to examine this privilege 
and recognize the inability of 
countless families across America 
to do the same. Friendsgivings 
should be encouraged for those 
without readily accessible, stable 
and happy families, but both 
institutions 
should 
prioritize 
giving respect to Native Americans 
and remembering the trauma 
these holidays have caused.

“There’s no place like home for the holidays.” 
This lyric from the popular song “Home 
for the Holidays” has become a staple of the 
holiday season. However, while rampant 
global consumerism and capitalism wants us to 
believe the holidays are filled with gingerbread 
houses and smiling grandmas, that is simply 
not the case for many Americans. Many of us 
(especially those in the LGBTQIA+ community) 
search for a home away from home during the 
holiday season. At least, that’s what Taylor 
Mac, co-director and star of “Taylor Mac’s 
Holiday Sauce” did. According to their website, 
“Taylor Mac’s Holiday Sauce” is a “two-hour 
intermission-less extravaganza (musical show) 
for an adult, gay-friendly audience.” 
In an interview with “Q Voice News,” Mac 
(who uses the pronoun “judy” lowercase sic 
unless at the start of a sentence) described 
judy’s holiday experience as “tortorous and 
homophobic.” Mac said, “‘Holiday Sauce’ is a 
tribute to my drag mother, Mother Flawless 
Sabrina. I went to a Christmas party and a 
couple of holiday parties at her house. They 
were the best. The parties were so freeing. I 
didn’t have to hang out with family. I could be 
myself. It was a loving environment.”
“Taylor Mac’s Holiday Sauce” is brought to 
Ann Arbor by the University Musical Society. 
Mac, along with a “spectacular” band and 
surprise special guests, will take the stage of 
the Power Center Sat. Dec. 14 at 8 p.m. and Sun. 
Dec. 15 at 4 p.m. 
“Taylor grew up queer and went on to 
find a found family in New York City,” said 
Co-Director of “Taylor Mac’s Holiday Sauce” 

Niegel Smith in an interview with The 
Daily. Smith and Taylor are longtime artistic 
collaborators. “Taylor Mac’s Holiday Sauce” 
is just another one of their collaborative 
masterpieces. 
“Taylor and I are working to make the culture 
we want to see in the world,” Smith said. The 
performances in “Taylor Mac’s Holiday Sauce” 
contain a celebratory and healing culture 
that extends to its audience, too. The audience 
members, many who may or may not find solace 
in going home for the holidays, can certainly 
find an exciting home for themselves while 
watching the performance. 
“I hope everyone is a little surprised and 
delighted, and we center our elders and those 
who came before us. You’ll know what I mean 
by that when you come to the show,” Smith said.
Like its audience, the show itself is changing 
and growing with the times. “Each iteration 
(of) the work changes … constantly evolving 
as we evolve and as our world evolves,” Smith 
said. 
The show skillfully uses costuming to 
comment on our ever-changing world. Costume 
designer Machine Dazzle has created costumes 
that can be considered characters of their own.
“There is a maximalism in Machines’ 
aesthetic. Inside each costume are added 
layers that slowly reveal themselves,” Smith 
said. “Machine is looking to not only express 
the character with the costumes but to show a 
deeper message beneath.” 
The costuming for this show is incomparable 
to almost everything in our current theatrical 
landscape.

Shia LaBeouf has always been a character. In 2014, at the Berlin Film 
Festival, he wore a paper bag over his head reading “I am Not Famous 
Anymore.” Later that same year, he performed #IAMSORRY, where 
he wore the paper bag again and let people visit him in a room while 
he sat silently, sometimes weeping. On top of these performances 
were multiple arrests for public drunkenness, that culminated in a 
2017 incident after which he attended a 12-step rehab and anger 
management program. That is where “Honey Boy,” written by 
LaBeouf and directed by Alma Har’el (“LoveTrue”), was written. 
In an opening montage centered around LaBeouf’s breakthrough 
in the early 2000s, Otis, LaBeouf’s cinematic alter ego played by 
Lucas Hedges (“Boy Erased”), falls apart in a booze soaked spiral as 
he films blockbuster after blockbuster. It’s jarring, almost painfully 
so, making it the perfect way to convey a fractured, addicted 
headspace. After a horrific car wreck and an arrest where he spars 
with police officers, Otis is sent to rehab. 
Then the movie jumps to Otis’s childhood. Noah Jupe (“A Quiet 
Place”), a child actor, plays young Otis. His father, played by LaBeouf, 
acts as his chaperone. He’s a recovering alcoholic and convicted 
felon, constantly hitting on the nearest woman and reminding anyone 
and everyone about his glory days as a rodeo clown. He’s latched onto 
his son for the money from his acting success, not to right any wrongs. 

Yet this is no caricature — LaBeouf has never performed this well 
or this honestly. Playing his own father, LaBeouf wears his heart on 
his sleeve. He’s not afraid to rip it to shreds right in front of one’s eyes. 
The bulk of the movie is conversations between Otis and his father, 
with each character asking for what the other cannot give them. Otis 
needs a stable adult in his life, while his father wants his son to forgive, 
condone and encourage his bad choices. While their relationship 
is anything but healthy, there’s still love between them, which, for 
better or for worse, makes it hard for either of them to step away. 
Adult Otis watches this all play out with the audience, trying 
to come to terms with it. The rehab scenes are just as honest as 

the 
flashbacks, 
with 
LaBeouf 
psychoanalyzing his own anger 
issues, narcissism, trauma and 
addiction. It’s incredibly brave. 
“Honey 
Boy” 
is 
a 
riveting 
dialogue between past and present; 
between violence and trauma. It’s 
genuinely heartbreaking. There 
are no easy answers, and one gets 
the sense that LaBeouf himself 
still isn’t sure how to feel about his 
father. 
Looking 
back, 
LaBeouf’s 
performance art doesn’t seem 
so silly. Of course he would try 
and avoid fame after what his 
childhood was like. Plus, what’s so 
different between making a movie 
like “Honey Boy” and sitting alone 
with strangers and crying one’s 
eyes out, laying personal trauma 
bare for all the world to see? It may 
not be the most subtle, structured 
or healthy way to go about things, 
but it makes for remarkable 
cinema.

‘Honey Boy’ is a heartbreaking look at past & present

Boy

“Reprisal” thinks it’s really cool. And you know 
what? It’s right. “Reprisal” is cool. It’s a gorgeous 
blend of neon lights, Lolita sunglasses, dank motel 
rooms, rusty hot rods and sequins on burlesque 
costumes. The time period is hazy — flip phones 
are as present as pastel rotary landlines. “Reprisal” 
has a lot going for it. Whether it’s enough to be truly 
worthwhile remains to be seen.
The story, while presented as twisted and 
complex, is rather simple: A man betrays a woman. 
The woman gets revenge. The man 
and woman in question, however, 
are brother and sister. Together, 
they make up a sibling team who 
run a vaguely Southern, extremely 
violent gang called the Banished 
Brawlers. Picking up years after 
her brother Burt left her for dead, 
“Reprisal” 
follows 
Katherine 
Harlow (Abigail Spencer, “Mad 
Men,”) now under the alias Doris 
Quinn. Since her brush with death, 
Doris married a wealthy Detroit 
restauranteur with a terminal 
illness, so she eventually can collect 
his inheritance.
Meanwhile, a former employee of Doris, 
Ethan Hart (Mena Massoud, “Aladdin”) arrives 
at Burt’s Bang-a-Rang, a no-holds-barred night 
club operating as the Brawlers’s headquarters. 
Ethan is soon recruited by a smaller group called 
the Three River Phoenixes to help transport 
contraband between the Bang-a-Rang’s various 
branch locations. As a Phoenix, Ethan meets — 
and becomes infatuated with — the club’s star 
pin-up girl Meredith (Madison Davenport, “Sharp 
Objects”) who happens to be the daughter of the 
gang’s leader, Burt Harlow. 
As Ethan gains trust with the Phoenixes, he 
communicates his successes with Doris, who has 
been slowly building a gang of her own to take 
down the Brawlers from the inside. With the help of 
two small-time criminals and her timid daughter-

in-law, Doris sets out to reclaim her identity as 
Katherine and destroy her brother’s empire. 
Despite its solid concept and striking exterior, 
“Reprisal” starts off slow and relies on gratuitous 
violence and trite mobster-movie dialogue to 
bide time before Doris/Katherine can get bloody 
revenge. Within the first four episodes, the show 
sets up so many subplots for minor characters that, 
even with a flawless look, the story feels messy and 
disorganized. 
Rather than explore the nuances of Doris’s story, 
“Reprisal” sets up every character as seeking their 
own individual form of redemption. Ethan’s wanted 
for murder in Michigan. Meredith searches for her 
missing stunt-woman mother and 
sells dangerous hallucinogens to 
bankroll her investigation. Gang 
elder Joel (Rodrigo Santoro, “300”) 
leads the Brawlers while trying 
to raise his young daughter away 
from the violence. Burlesque emcee 
Queenie (Lea DeLaria, “Orange 
Is the New Black”) tries to assert 
herself as a valuable member of 
the gang. As the season progresses, 
“Reprisal” starts feeling more like a 
TV-MA version of “Riverdale” than 
a coherent, adult drama. 
The stakes of “Reprisal” are 
constantly changing, and, as a 
result, the pacing of the show suffers. One minute, 
a room of bikers are getting murdered. The 
next, a girl watches a home video from the ’70s. 
Yet, somehow, both moments are still boring in 
comparison to the very best of the show’s visuals. 
In trying to cross over into multiple genres and 
aesthetics, “Reprisal” can’t settle on what actually 
works.
“Reprisal” may not be the next “Sopranos” 
or “Sons of Anarchy.” It may not be the most 
innovative or compelling thing on TV right now. It 
may not even be the best “woman seeks revenge in 
patriarchal system” show on Hulu at the moment 
— looking at you, “Handmaid’s Tale.” However, 
if “Reprisal” can figure out what its strongest 
characters and story lines are, the show could end 
up being just as cool as it looks.

‘Reprisal’ is try-hard TV

TV REVIEW

ANYA SOLLER
Daily Arts Writer

It turns out 2019 wasn’t the Year of the Pig: 
2019 was actually the Year of the Orange. Yeah, 
that’s right. But what does that mean, you might 
find yourself asking. I’ll tell you. 2019 was the Year 
of the Orange because San Francisco, CA’s finest, 
Larry June, dropped not one, not two, but five 
albums. In one year! That’s crazy. It’s like that time 
in 2017 when King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard 
released four solo albums and one collaborative 
album (with the Mild High Club). Each of those 
albums had their own sound and vibe, which 
was a hell of a lot of fun to listen to throughout 
the year. The same goes for Larry June’s string of 
releases over the past twelve months. 
Two things make Larry’s historic run different 
from that of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, 
though. First, he’s a rapper. Second, his five 
albums were a lot more fun to listen to throughout 
the year. 
Larry June is such a developed and fully-
realized character that it’s hard to take him 
seriously as an artist. For his entire career, he has 
worked to maintain a certain persona, one that’s 
carefree, loose, candid and in love with Whole 
Foods. He loves his city, oranges (so much that 
they’re featured prominently on a couple of his 
album covers), riding his bike and looking after his 
son. On the microphone, he’s a goofy character. 
There’s no debating that. He’s prone to erratically 
hopping on and off the beat, often just to talk shit 
and stunt. He adlibs things like “good job, Larry” 
and “yeehee!” at the end of damn near every line 
he raps. He often relies more on his charisma 
than his rapping ability to entertain listeners. He 
releases a lot of music, at least a couple of times 
per year. Some of it good, some of it bad, very little 
of it great. But he took December of 2018 and most 
of the new year’s first two months off to collect 
himself. It’s a good thing he did. Starting with the 
release of his first project of 2019, February’s Early 
Bird, there was a new Larry in town.
Early Bird is the perfect execution of the things 
everyone loves about Larry June: the ad-libs, 
the rants, the health food talk, the shit talk and 
the bizarre flexes. He raps about the things that 
normal people talk about with their friends. 
However, unlike past releases, the flows are 
tighter, bars more descriptive and the sound more 
cohesive. The beat selection is impeccable, bouncy 
and never boring. At one point on album opener 
“Lets Go Eat,” he raps, assisted by a bombastic 
take on the classic Bay Area sound, “This not 
a date baby girl, this just how I play / A little 65 

dollars ain’t nothing to me.” That’s the Larry 
everyone loves, flexing the same way an average 
person would when talking about a night out.
However, Larry introduces a new side of 
himself in this new project. He was seldom ever 
sentimental or introspective on his previous 
releases, but on Early Bird, he shows that he’s more 
than just a braggadocious goofball. On the chorus 
of the title track, he delves into his personal life 
a bit, rapping, “To live like this, you gon have to 
take Ls / You gon have to fall off, you gon have to 
bounce back / Have you ever lost it all, hundred 
thou to a rat / God, I’d trade everything to have 
my grandma back.” Moments like these show just 
how much Larry June has grown as an artist. You 
can’t help but be proud of him.
His next project, April’s The Port of San 
Francisco, keeps the ball rolling. This time around, 
though, Larry shows off some of his versatility. 
The album is slower, groovier and more intimate, 
thanks to its soul-inspired sound. It’s like a loved-
up version of Early Bird, and it’s so fun to listen 
to. The album reaches its climax on the Polyester 
the Saint-assisted song, “Let’s Get Smoothies.” He 
talks about all the things he loves about his girl, 
and it’s not just the obvious things that rappers 
often say when they praise their girls. He points 
to her aversion to posting too much on Instagram, 
and he suggests taking her biking around the 
city — something that he typically only does by 
himself. This album proved that Early Bird wasn’t 
just a fluke and that 2019 really has been Larry’s 
year.
What’s 
impressive 
is 
that 
each 
release 
brings something different to the table. June’s 
CardoGotWings-produced Mr. Midnight brought 
the extra-boastful bangers, September’s Out the 
Trunk brought the chillers and October’s Product 
of the Dope Game brought a street-oriented mix of 
them all, like a victory lap of sorts. Each release 
reveals a new dimension of Larry. The widely-
mocked rapper has transformed himself into 
someone respectable. 
What’s great about it all, though, is that Larry 
never forgets who he is. He’s still the same Larry 
on each album. He still flexes about pedestrian 
things, like how much his Hydroflask cost, while 
spouting motivational speeches, often on the 
same song. He’s still hilarious and unleashes the 
best ad-libs in the game, even if he does go a little 
overboard at times (he really goes off on “Baggage

The day after Thanksgiving, my family puts “Elf” on our 
television on repeat for the entire rest of the weekend. We 
own it on DVD and our Apple TV, too, just in case. If I had 
to, I could recite the entire thing to you from start to finish. 
I don’t even think it’s funny anymore, it’s just a tradition. 
Miraculously, after watching “Elf” for 48 hours straight, my 
excitement toward winter break kicks right into gear.
My usual grey sweatshirt and sweatpants turn into 
festive red dresses. My usual hatred for making eye contact 
on Blue Buses turns into easy small talk and new friends. My 
actual friends usually line the halls of the Walgreen Drama 
Center with complaints of how dry the weather is, but in 
December they also cheerfully hum Christmas tunes while 
still complaining. 
The holidays are a time for happiness and cheer, and every 
single movie pertaining to the season tells me so. Even the 
trashiest Hallmark movie helps guide us in the direction of 
general merriment. Last Wednesday, I was dead tired from 
six hours of tech rehearsal and a full day of classes. I saw 
that the movie “Love Actually” was on television, and I sat 
wide awake, entranced for a full two and a half hours. 
Even my vernacular is affected by these movies. When 

the month of December rolls around, you aren’t “upset,” 
you are “an angry elf.” You aren’t “dumb,” you are a “cotton-
headed ninny muggins.” Anytime a friend leaves class, my 
immediate goodbye phrase is, “Bye Buddy, I hope you find 
your dad,” in full Mr. Narwhal voice, regardless of their 
gender. I know these are all “Elf” references, but Will 
Ferrell is just such a genius when it comes to comedy. At 
the very least, I crack myself up when choosing to use these 
phrases instead of the usual trendy Gen-Z phrase of the day. 
Holiday movies sit with us so profoundly because they are 
possibly the only parts of our formative years that do not 
betray us later in life. I know that the new Netflix Christmas 
movie is probably awful, but I still press play while I do 
my laundry because I know exactly how it will make me 
feel: warm and fuzzy. I don’t know what kind of hypnotic 
magic they put in those plot lines, but holiday movies are 
addicting. The purity of the message in each movie allows 
us not only to have faith in our community, but also greater 
faith in humanity as a whole. 
In the end, all we need during those last couple weeks 
of December is a little bit of a break and a charming story 
of the loved ones we share it with. As Buddy the Elf would 
say, “The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud 
for all to hear.” Regardless of what you’re celebrating this 
winter break, I hope you spend time to sing and rejoice in 
the people you love. 

The movies we wait all year to watch

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

NATALIE KASTNER
Daily Arts Writer

It was a huge year in gaming. From the revival of classic 
franchises, to the success of numerous indie darlings, as the year 
comes to a close it’s time to reflect on our best experiences. Here 
is The Daily’s pick for the best video games of 2019. 
“Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice”
Controversial? Yes. A new beginning? Yes. Mentally strenuous 
and engaging? Yes. A game for everyone? No. “Sekiro: Shadows 
Die Twice” is a masterpiece of gaming because it does not 
compromise. After concluding their critically acclaimed series 
“Dark Souls,” developers FromSoftware had a vision and stuck 
to it. That vision is “Sekiro”: the 15th century Japanese themed, 
stealth, action adventure that had gamers either glued to their 
screens or screaming at it. “Sekiro” is hard, very, very hard. But 
it’s exactly this struggle which allows the player to appreciate 
the craft and sophistication that went into this game. “Sekiro” 
does not accommodate for its audience, the audience must 
accommodate to it. To endure it is to admire it. “Sekiro: Shadows 
Die Twice” is committed to an artistic message. It is that 
commitment that makes it the best game of 2019. 
“The Outer Worlds”
“The Outer Worlds” is proof that video games have transitioned 
into the age of intertextuality. The relationship between “The 
Outer Worlds” and video classics is one of homage and reverence. 

It’s fitting that this game was released in 2019 because veteran 
gamers will find that “The Outer Worlds” is a nostalgia trip 
through some of the best games of the decade. Developed by some 
of the best brains behind the Fallout series, “The Outer Worlds” 
plays very similarly but also borrows creative mechanics from 
other successful games. Blasting your way through an art deco 
inspired galaxy controlled by corporate oligarchy is well … a blast. 
Despite its many allusions to classic video games and sci-fi, “The 
Outer Worlds” manages to tell a story with political relevance 
while still keeping things light hearted. “The Outer Worlds” puts 
video games into the context of cultural history and reminds old 
time gamers how far the medium has come. 
“Mordhau” 
“Mordhau” is a competitive first-person medieval warfare 
game with a skill ceiling so high, I could get a Masters degree in 
it. This indie darling not only managed to capture the attention 
of the steam community, but also all my free time. The thrill 
of charging into battle along 60 plus players, shields ready and 
swords primed is a thrill second to none. The best part of this game 
is its complex and difficult but rewarding combat. “Mordhau” is 
a game of infinite approaches. By utilizing slashes, lunges, faints 
and blocks, combat turns into a dance. You’ll probably get sliced 
to bits in your first couple hours, but stick around for a while and 
you’ll be a master knight wielding excalibur as your sword. 
“Mortal Kombat 11”
For a franchise that revels in gore and spectacle, who thought 
that slowing things down would make for a better game? This is 

exactly what “Mortal Kombat 11” does. By taking everything down 
a pace, “Mortal Kombat 11” delivers the best fighting experience 
I’ve had in years. So long are the days of button mashing and 
cheap wins. I now feel like I can have a fair fight with my friends. 
Add back the signature gore and bloody finisher moves and what 
you get is a game that provides desensitizing masochistic fun for 
everyone in the family. I’ve lost count of how many arguments 
I’ve settled over “Mortal Kombat” this year. 
“Call of Duty: Modern Warfare” 
I never thought I’d see the day, much less be the one to report 
it, but “Call of Duty” has made a comeback. For about a decade, 
“Call of Duty” was a washed up celebrity, showing up every year, 
managing to turn a couple heads, but at the end of the day, still 
irrelevant. After making cookie cutter game after cookie cutter 
game, people were tired and any fan who wasn’t a prepubescent 
boy would agree that “Call of Duty” had seen better days. Taking 
a much needed break and not even including a single player 
campaign in the last installment, Activision has returned with 
a game that is so rich in visual detail it scares me. “Modern 
Warfare” looks and sounds like real life. Stalking through a 
terrorist hideout with night vision goggles and silenced weapons 
might sound like standard video game affair. Yet its creaking 
of the floorboards, the quiet ding of bullet casings falling to 
the ground, the shortening of breath as your character is about 
to open a door. These tiny details accentuate every experience 
making “Modern Warfare” the most realistic game I’ve played 
in 2019.

In our humble opinion, the best video games of 2019

Comedian Matt Berry’s (“What We Do in the Shadows”) 
“Toast of London” has been running on Channel 4 for more 
than five years now, only recently traveling over the Atlantic 
airwaves and underwater cables to Netflix and IFC in the U.S. 
As with many examples of British comedy, it may take a bit 
of warming up to it to really enjoy, but once you embrace its 
nonsense, it’s one of the funniest shows out there
“Toast of London” revolves around the life of its protagonist 
Steven Toast (Berry), a hopelessly lost and eccentric stage 
actor whose life mostly consists of bumbling around and 
confronting a bizarre set of characters, from a rival actor 

known as Ray (“Bloody”), Purchase (Harry Peacock, “The 
Kennedys”) and his landlord Ed-Howzard Black (Robert 
Bathurst, “Downton Abbey”).
Berry and Arthur Matthews, the writers of the show, have 
a glittering resume of TV comedy. Berry has taken part in 
classics such as “The IT Crowd” and “The Might Boosh,” and 
Matthews co-created one of the finest TV comedies of all 
time, the timeless “Father Ted.” They take many of the same 
elements of the aforementioned shows, but tone down some of 

the innocent silliness in favor of an unhinged vulgarity.
The show is loosely serialized, but most episodes deal 
with largely independent arcs. The premiere finds Toast 
in a conversation with his inept agent Jane Plough (Sarah-
Doon Makichan, “Good Omens”) about finding new roles 
and expanding his horizons. This conversation takes place 

after the rousing failure of his current play, whose title is 
supposedly so obscene that every time it is mentioned by a 
character, all we hear is, well, 
a host of other sounds. Berry’s 
delivery suggests he is always 
on stage, eschewing any form 
of dynamic range other than a 
powerful, straight-from-the-
diaphragm voice. 
In 
addition, 
he 
has 
a 
distinctly individual accent. 
While 
slightly 
unnerving 
at first, it makes a bit more 
sense if you view the series 
as a set of live theater bits. 
The voice as well as the litany 
of 
facial 
expressions 
that 
Berry produces fit the self-
aggrandizing 
character 
of 
Toast perfectly.
The premiere also gives 
a taste of the absurdity that 
defines the show, involving 

episodes such as Toast interviewing a producer in jail for 
Holocaust denial. “Toast of London” is unapologetically crass 
and stupid equally as often as it is unbelievably clever. It’s a 
credit to the writers that that line is towed almost perfectly 
in each episode.
Viewers of “Toast of London” will feel utter confusion 
upon their first watch, but the show is intriguing enough that 
it warrants a rewatch. After a rewatch, it will be extremely 
difficult not to fall for its charm.

‘Toast of London’ is bizzare, surreal and a total trip

Birthdays and Santa: Quick hits with Jack Summers and Keaton Pehrson

The Daily hockey beat used 
to run a video series during the 
2011-12 season called “Quick 
Hits.” They were one-on-one 
interviews with players that 
covered everyday life and all of 
its funny moments. But now, for 
budget reasons, it’s in written 
format.
For the last edition of the 
semester, The Daily’s Molly 
Shea and Tien Le sat down 
with 
linemates, 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Jack 
Summers 
and 
freshman 
defenseman 
Keaton Pehrson, to discuss the 
upcoming holiday season and 
their teammates.
***
Molly: We heard that it’s your 
birthday today. So, what’s your 
favorite birthday that you’ve 
ever had?
Keaton: Oooh. That’s tough. 
It’d probably be one when I was 
younger. Oh! I know which one 
it is. It’s my Golden Birthday 
when I was 10, and we went 
to the Water Park of America 
in Minneapolis. Got to stay 
overnight at the water park with 
a bunch of my buddies. 
Tien: What about you, Jack?
Jack: Uhhhh. Probably just 
going to Zap Zone. Me and my 
buddies used to always go every 
year for my birthday and their 
birthdays, so that was always a 
fun time.
Tien: Molly just turned 19 the 
other week.
Jack: Oh really? What did you 
do for your birthday?
Molly: No. I’m 22. And I went 
to Rick’s.
Molly: 
You 
guys 
are 
a 
defensive pairing, if you had to 
come up with a nickname for 
your pairing what would it be?
Jack: Probably something like 
salad.
Keaton: Salad guys?
Jack: The salad men?

Keaton: Salad men!!!!
Tien: Why?
Jack: The hair. Long hair.
They both run their hands 
through their hair.
Keaton: Because the salad. 
It’s greasy.
Jack: Long hair. It’s called 
salad.
Molly: Ohhhhhhhh.
Tien: Fair enough. So you 
guys played juniors together, do 
you have any fun memories from 
that time together?
Keaton: I think it was fun 
just getting to play with him. 
Knowing we were both going to 
Michigan, build some chemistry 
early and then know we’re going 
to go to college together was 
pretty cool.
Jack: Yeah we played together 
that first year as a D-pair, so it 
was just good getting to know 
him early.
Molly: 
Favorite 
holiday 
tradition?
Jack: 
The 
team 
always 
gets together for a Christmas 
gathering before we all leave 
for break. So that’s pretty fun. 
Otherwise, just being able to go 
home for a week and spend time 
with the family and catch up 
with everyone and see everyone 
is always a good time.
Keaton: Yeah, getting to see 
family. I have a little pond in my 
backyard so we’ll shovel it off a 
rink and everyone will go skate 
out there. Which is pretty fun.
Tien: 
Favorite 
Christmas 
song?
Jack: That’s tough.
Keaton: 
All 
I 
Want 
for 
Christmas.
Jack: Mariah Carey!
Keaton: Yeah, Mariah Carey. 
That’s a good one.
Molly: If you had to switch 
lives with someone on the team, 
who would you pick?
Keaton: Oooh. I’d go Cam 
York. I’d wanna know what it’s 
like to have all those Instagram 
followers.
Freshman 
Cam 
York 
has 
12.5k followers on Instagram, 
meanwhile Keaton has 1,475 and 

Jack has 794. Oof.
Jack: Man, I don’t know. 
Probably the same. He lives a 
pretty good life.
Keaton: 
See 
what it’s like to 
be famous. It’d 
be nice.
Molly: 
When 
did 
you 
stop 
believing 
in 
Santa?
Jack: 
Oooh. 
I think I was 
pretty 
old 
honestly. 
Keaton: Mine 
was pretty late, too.
Jack: Maybe 10?
Keaton: Oh mine was later 
than that. It was probably, wait 
when’s middle school? 
Jack: Eighth grade?
Keaton: No.

Jack: Freshman year?
Keaton: No. Probably like fifth 
or sixth grade. Right around 
when you’re getting ready to go 
to middle school. 
People 
would 
always tell me 
but 
I 
would 
always say, “No. 
He’s real!”
Molly: If, for 
whatever reason, 
the pilot couldn’t 
fly 
the 
plane, 
who would you 
trust the most?
Jack: Probably 
(Jack) Becker. He’s definitely 
the smartest guy on the team for 
sure.
Keaton: I’d say him, or Strauss 
(Mann). Strauss is just … not 
weird but … he’s a little different. 
So that’d be something he’d 

know how to do maybe. Just fly 
a plane. 
Molly: Are you superstitious 
about any pregame routines?
Jack: Not really. I just do 
everything the same, every time. 
It’s not really a superstition. It 
just gets my mind right. It’s not 
too much.
Keaton: Yeah, not really.
Molly: 
Nick 
Blankenburg 
mentioned you like to sit in 
seat six in the stands before 
warmups.
Jack: Yeah. Row six, seat six. I 
just always do that. 
Because 
that’s 
not 
superstitious at all… 
Molly: Why’d you choose six 
as your jersey number?
Jack: So I grew up playing 
baseball, and that was always 
my baseball number. So when I 
had to choose between hockey 

or baseball, I picked hockey. So 
I always kept six in memory of 
baseball.
*Nick Blankenburg enters the 
room*
Nick 
*panicking*: 
We’re 
about to start lift. Can’t be late. 
Or else I’m screwed.
Tien: Alright, last question. 
So if you were stranded on a 
deserted island with someone 
from the team, who would you 
pick?
Keaton: I’m going to go with 
Winny (Adam Winborg). He 
seems like he’s got survival 
skills, and he’s a pretty big man. 
We could fend for ourselves, I 
think.
Jack: Yeah, definitely him.
Keaton *has an epiphany*: Oh! 
Ooh! Is it (the recording) still 
going? Luke Morgan actually. 
That guy is a survival man.

Illinois bigs the focus for Wolverines

Last Friday, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team scored 
103 points against Iowa. One-
hundred-and-three.
Under former coach John 
Beilein, the Wolverines had only 
scored above 100 points six times 
— and never against a Big Ten 
opponent. Michigan seemingly 
only managed to crack triple 
digits against low-level non-
conference foes, and based on 
Beilein’s more elaborate, drawn 
out offensive plays, it seemed to 
be almost on accident.
But things are different under 
new 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard. 
The Wolverines are launching 
3-pointers in transition, playing 
with pace and 
getting 
shots 
off early in the 
shot clock. So 
when Michigan 
treks down to 
Champaign 
on Wednesday 
to 
square 
off 
against Illinois 
— the Big Ten’s 
highest scoring 
offense — the 
game is sure to be a barn burner.
For those not familiar with 
the term, a barn burner indicates 
a high-scoring affair for one of 
those inexplicable reasons that 
only locals understand. But 
Wednesday’s 
matchup 
has 
the potential to 
not just light the 
barn on fire, but 
take the rest of 
the farm with it.
The 
Illini 
have 
already 
put up over 100 
points 
twice 
this 
season, 
highlighted 
by a 120-point smackdown of 
Hampton. In the effort, Illinois’ 
prolific offense was led by 
its two bright stars — center 
Kofi Cockburn and guard Ayo 
Dosunmo, who both dropped 20.
Cockburn has been having 
a monster season, averaging a 
double-double with 16.3 points 

per game and 11.2 rebounds per 
game. Also averaging 1.3 blocks 
per game, the 7-footer has a 
physical skill set that reads like 
a grocery list.
“Strong, 
tough, 
physical, 
inside presence, 
plays 
extremely 
hard, very good 
on the low block,” 
Howard 
said. 
“Another 
thing 
that stands out is, 
(he’s an) excellent 
offensive 
rebounder. Built 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
toughness 
and 
his 
frame 
just 
breathes toughness all over him. 
So we have to, of course, match 
his toughness. Our guys are very 
competitive, and they’re not 
afraid, but they love competing 
against any big that steps on the 
floor.”
In short, he’s 
going to be a 
problem.
The last time 
Michigan saw a 
physically gifted, 
dominant 
big 
down low — the 
Hawkeyes’ Luka 
Garza on Friday 
— he destroyed 
his career high 
and bruised the Wolverines for a 
whopping 44 points. Then again, 
the big man took 32 shots and 
no one else in a black and yellow 
jersey could hit a cloud from an 
airplane, leading to a 12-point 
Michigan win.
While Cockburn undoubtedly 
presents a challenge, senior 

center Jon Teske is certain that 
the big man is nothing he hasn’t 
seen before. 
“It’s another big body,” Teske 
said. “In the Big Ten, you play 
against a big center every night. 
He’s another one. We gotta 
be ready for him. He’s a big, 
physical big man down there, 
and we just gotta hold our own. 
He’s gonna get his looks, he’s 
gonna get his touches and he’s 
gonna score points. We’re not 
gonna shut him out, he’s gonna 
get his, and we just gotta limit 
what he does.”
Teske’s answer is fairly telling 
in how the Wolverines are 
going to look to play Cockburn. 
In 
previous 
games 
against 
prolific bigs, Michigan’s game 
plan has been to limit the fouls 
called on Teske and backup 
bigs sophomore Colin Castleton 
and senior Austin Davis, letting 
the opponent pad the stat sheet 
while trusting the Wolverines’ 
offense to inflict maximum 
damage on the other end of the 
floor.
And if Michigan does get in 
foul or injury trouble — as was 
the case Friday with Teske on 
the bench and Castleton in the 
locker room with a lip injury — 
the Wolverines have the depth to 
respond and maintain pressure 
in the low post on both ends of 
the floor.
It worked Friday, when the 
third digit of the scoreboard 
was lit up for just the seventh 
time in nearly 13 years. And on 
Wednesday, Michigan is hoping 
— between Teske, Castleton, 
Davis and a bit of luck — to tack 
another one in the win column.

‘M’ bench limiting scoring droughts

Midway through the third 
quarter on Sunday, Michigan 
found itself on the wrong end of 
an Oakland run. 
After hitting only one field 
goal 
in 
four 
minutes, 
the 
Wolverines 
saw 
their 
once 
13-point lead dwindle down to 
just four with 2:18 remaining 
in the quarter. Meanwhile, the 
Grizzlies were on fire, scoring 
13 points over that same stretch. 
Michigan needed a spark. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon delivered, notching six 
points in two minutes. With her 
help, the Wolverines closed the 
third quarter with an 8-0 run 
of their own, re-establishing 
the lead and putting an end to 
Oakland’s upset bid. 
Runs are a normal part of 
basketball. For various reasons, 
practically every team will go 
through stretches where the 
shots just aren’t falling. On 
Sunday, physical and emotional 
fatigue likely came into play 
for Michigan, as it was coming 
off of an overtime win against 
Syracuse just three nights prior. 
“That was a really tough 
recovery after Thursday,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I knew that today we 
were still kind of physically 
and emotionally exhausted and 
that it was gonna be a little bit 
of a grind, but we figured out a 
way to do it and it was a great 
victory.”
The key to surviving these 
scoring droughts lies in damage 
control. When the Wolverines 
go through stretches where 
they struggle to score points, 
they need to rely on their strong 
defense, hit a couple easy layups 
or make substitutions to give 
their starters a rest and allow 
fresh players a chance to make 
a difference. 
On Sunday, it was Hillmon 
who snapped the Grizzlies’ run 
with two layups and two free 
throws. Limiting the damage 
becomes a lot easier when 
Michigan relies on its leading 
scorer to pick up easy baskets 
when they desperately need 

them. 
“I don’t even know her 
numbers, but I know they’re 
high,” said sophomore guard 
Amy Dilk. “Every day we try to 
get the ball to Naz and let her 
do her work — especially if it’s 
one-on-one, they can’t handle 
that.”
But the Wolverines can’t 
always count on Hillmon to 
provide that spark — especially 
since she is currently nursing 
a minor ankle injury. They’ll 
have to get it from some other 
options 
down 
the stretch, and 
with a lot of 
players 
seeing 
significant 
playing time so 
far this year, the 
prospects seem 
pretty good. 
Michigan’s 
freshmen 
in 
particular 
provide 
great 
scoring options off the bench. 
Guard Michelle Sidor has been 
capable from three so far, 
shooting 13-for-33 — the most 
makes on the team. She has not 
been afraid to shoot the ball in 
her various appearances this 
season, and her high-energy 
style of play makes her a great 
spark off the bench when shots 
aren’t falling.
Center Izabel Varejão has 
also been a solid change of 

pace 
as 
a 
substitute. 
Her 
6-foot-4 
frame 
makes 
her 
incredibly difficult to guard in 
the post, and she’s sunk a pair 
of threes this year as well. If 
she can continue to develop 
her post game and cut back on 
turnovers, she’ll be a reliable 
weapon when the starters are 
struggling to score points. 
It’s not just the freshmen, 
either. Junior guard Priscilla 
Smeenge and sophomore guard 
Danielle Rauch both played 
meaningful minutes on Sunday, 
demonstrating 
the Wolverines’ 
depth 
and 
providing 
Barnes 
Arico 
with even more 
options 
when 
the team needs 
a spark.
“We’re 
only 
as strong as our 
weakest 
link,” 
Smeenge 
said. 
“I feel like our 11th person 
and whoever’s coming off the 
bench can do a really good job 
of contributing”
Michigan will need those 
contributions from the bench 
even 
more 
as 
the 
season 
progresses. Its opponents will 
go on runs — after all, they’re 
just part of the game — and it 
will have to hope that its depth 
can continue to produce in 
high-pressure situations.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | DECEMBER 11, 2019

E

very woman in my life has had to ask herself the 
question: What does consent mean to me?” 
My friend Sophie told me this when I first ver-
balized feelings about my experiences with sexual miscon-
duct. 
I was confronted with the enduring effects of these expe-
riences at the beginning of this semester, so I started devel-
oping the vocabulary I needed to explain what happened 
and how it impacted me. The effects of sexual harassment 
and sexual assault manifest differently for different people, 
and my reaction has always come in the form of compart-
mentalization and avoidance. 
I chose to evade these experiences for months, even years, 
after they occurred. They were simply “weird things” that 
happened to me, moments that were uncomfortable and 
awkward. Moments that just didn’t go well and weren’t 
worth talking about because I wasn’t a victim. I refused to 
let myself feel anything but slight unease about these situa-
tions because I thought what happened wasn’t “bad enough” 
for me to be as upset as 
I was. 
The truth of the mat-
ter is if someone breaks 
physical 
barriers 
or 
pushes you into sexual 
circumstances without 
checking in, you’re not 
giving 
consent. 
Con-
sent doesn’t only apply 
to penetrative sex — it 
applies 
to 
touching, 
exposure 
or 
sexual 
activity of any kind. 
Consent applies to unsolicited comments about sex, requests 
for sexual favors and “teasing”, which are invasive and disre-
spectful acts that disregard important boundaries and leave 
the recipient feeling as if their autonomy is in question. 
However, the stigmas regarding sexual misconduct — the 
victim-blaming, lack of belief and internalized guilt that 
survivors feel — are existent and intimidating. Even though 
I can identify inappropriate behavior, I stand strongly with 
survivors and understand the importance of accountabil-
ity, I could not break these stigmas down in my own life. I 
instead blamed myself and pushed my experiences out of 
mind to avoid dealing with their effects.
“I think it would help you to put objective language to it. If 
someone else told you this story, what would you say?” 
My friend Nate asked me this when I began trying to pro-
cess what had happened.
Every time I tried to talk about my experiences, I found 
myself making excuses for the other person. My judgment 
was clouded. As a woman, our patriarchal society has taught 

me to go out in groups, analyze what my outfit says about my 
sexual desires and be cognizant of who I’m talking to. I’ve 
been told to always carry my drink with me and to not accept 
one I didn’t see poured with my own eyes. Society has pre-
pared me against boys in dark basements who I don’t know 
and it has warned me about those who might aggressively 
force sex. It’s all about how you can fight back or avoid a situ-
ation in the first place. It didn’t tell me that sexual miscon-
duct is a snake with many heads and that most victims know 
the person who sexually assaulted them.
Friends, colleagues and classmates perpetuate sexual 
misconduct. Loved ones perpetuate sexual misconduct. 
The idea that harassment and assault happens exclusively 
in the shadows with unknown, covert players is a disservice 
to understanding the breadth and complexity of the issue. 
People aren’t monsters, they are human beings shaped by 
their surroundings, and even people we know are capable of 
wrongly pushing, or breaking, boundaries. Our existing cul-
ture does nothing to curb sexual misconduct, support survi-

vors or hold those who do these things accountable.
Nate advising me to view my experiences objectively was 
the best idea I received when I began coping with my own 
feelings. I’ve always been a writer, and journaling helped 
me open up about the impact of past experiences. There’s 
something about articulating the pounding in my chest or 
the source of a random burst of emotion that makes it seem 
less scary or unfounded. But journaling is not objective: It 
leaves room for my own internalized guilt and shame and 
confusion to show itself. The idea that “if I could just get over 
it, then everything could go back to normal” appeared on my 
pages in a million variations. Journaling lets me process the 
good and the bad, the rational and the fallacious. 
I alleviated some of my stress by trying objective writing. 
In Angell Hall Auditorium A I sat with my class notebook in 
front of me, dated and prepped to jot down lecture points. 
But instead of tuning into what happened with the develop-
ment of sound in Hollywood, I wrote out what happened 
to me. I did this without using names or adjectives. I told 

the stories outside of myself, as if someone was in the room 
watching it all play out. This broke down some of the stigmas 
in my head. Looking at the folded up notebook paper, there 
was no question of blame. I was able to see that my inter-
nalized guilt and the fear that I was being “dramatic” were 
unfair. I was able to rationalize that consent is something I 
hold close to my chest to protect my bodily autonomy, and 
others haven’t respected that power.
“Let me send you this podcast I listened to about consent. 
It will be really triggering, but it could help.” 
My friend Danielle offered this to me after I had a notice-
ably difficult day.
“In the No” with Kaitlin Prest is a Radiolab podcast series 
collaboration that explores the meaning of consent. The link 
popped up on my iPhone, and after having a particularly bad 
day of crying fits and skipping class, I sat down and listened 
to part one. Kaitlin tells the story of her best friend sexu-
ally assaulting her and the subsequent damage caused by his 
problematic response to her pain.
It took me almost two 
hours to listen to this 55 
minute podcast. I was 
sitting in the fishbowl 
with my headphones in, 
watching students print-
ing and walking around 
the computer stations 
with a pen in my hand 
and my notebook on the 
desk in front of me. I 
wrote down everything 
that reminded me of my 
own experiences. I wrote 
down any powerful sentiments about consent that I either 
agreed with or hadn’t previously considered. I went in with 
a red pen and yellow highlighter until it looked like I was 
guaranteed an ‘A’ on my next exam.
This process helped me deal with what happened in an 
analytical way; it was like an audio mind-map connecting 
dots that I couldn’t before. I shared the notes with Sophie 
and Danielle — I started talking more and generally being 
more open about it. Knowing there are so many people in 
situations like mine, who have had questions and feelings 
similar to mine, has made me feel less alone. 
I’ve written poems and letters and bullet points and this 
article. I’ve gone to therapy and contextualized my situa-
tion to professors and colleagues. There’s an idea that sexual 
misconduct is something you don’t talk about, but if someone 
who experienced it opens up, listening can help the healing. 
To me, consent means ownership of my body and my 
story. Situations from my past don’t make this ownership 
any less real.

What consent means to me

BY ERIN WHITE, SENIOR OPINION EDITOR

CONSENT

“


I

n November, Victoria’s Secret announced the 
cancelation of their 2019 fashion show, citing 
increased competition, rapidly declining profits and 
a disconnect with their consumer base as reasons for the 
end of this decades long tradition. For a company that built 
an empire by selling sex, it seems as though sex has gone 
out of style. 
Victoria’s Secret’s downfall is a reflection of social and 
cultural change in the United States, which is moving 
further away from the characterization of women 
as needing to be sexy for men. Women are replacing 
Victoria’s Secret’s overpriced, poorly-made push-up 
bras for alternative brands and start-ups, that aim to be 
comfortable and inclusive. But the distaste for Victoria’s 
Secret represents something much deeper than the quality 
of an underwire or the lack of proper sizing.
It’s the experience of walking into a Victoria’s Secret 
store that goes against to the contemporary women’s 
movement; the stores exist as the perfect example to what 
society decided women should be. Each store is sickeningly 
pink and lacy, the walls covered with slow-moving images 
of thinly-clad, pouty-lipped women strutting to deafening 
house music. As a 120 year-old girl or a 20-year-old 
woman, the impact is the same: You feel small, insecure 
and unsexy. 
Perhaps the demise of Victoria’s Secret is promising 
for how our culture is changing, but today it still remains 
a market leader. Yet, lingerie is not the only sector 
facing criticism for its outdated portrayal of women. 
In Hollywood, where many gender constructions are 
reinforced through television and media scripts, women 
and women of color are still underrepresented and 
hypersexualized. 
Of the 100 top-grossing movies between 2017-2018, 

only nine percent of Hollywood movies had a gender-
balanced cast and only 33.1 percent of all named, speaking 
characters were women. Only 11 movies had a woman of 
color as the lead. There is 29.2 perecent of women being 
shown in revealing attire including teenage girls. Latina 
women, who make up only one out of 1,200 directors, are 
the most likely to be hypersexualized or shown nude in 
feature films. This misrepresentation shows that without 
women to write, direct or spearhead creative works, the 
female narrative becomes skewed. 
How does this erasure and subsequent fabrication of 
the female narrative impact viewers? For young girls, 
the internalized adherence to gender roles is almost 
impossible to fight off. Even I, who was raised in the same 
way and with the same opportunities as my brother, felt 
the immense pressure imposed on me through television 
and movies. In the action movies I would watch with my 
brother, there was always a male lead – the hero – and a 
female love interest, whose sole purpose was to look hot 
on the back of said hero’s motorcycle...and that’s about 
it. She would be lucky to even have a line. This kind of 
representation (or lack thereof) conditions women to 
the idea that we have to be quiet but sexy, powerful but 
secondary, active but objects. That our purpose is to please 
men.
It’s obvious that our institutions, brands and culture 
are rooted in patriarchal traditions, and though they are 
being reformed, change takes time. Meanwhile, a parallel 
process to that of culture and policy is occurring in social 
media, a free platform where women can take authority 
over their own bodies and rewrite the narrative. When 
I entered high school, social media like Instagram and 
Snapchat were beginning to take on a new life. I had been 
accustomed to posting awkward photos of myself throwing 

up the peace sign on Facebook or using Instagram for the 
“cool” filters. But in parallel to my budding adolescence, 
Snapchat and Instagram were now places where you 
could post pictures of your body – however exposed – and 
receive praise for it (most of the time). 
This ranged from girls posting selfies in low-cut tops 
for their 300 followers or to the popular body-positive 
movement, which overtook the media’s standard of beauty 
as thin, white and unblemished and was replaced by more 
realistic representations of women that they created 
themselves. The latter redefined the image of women in 
the media, but the former is where social media platforms 
and their place in empowerment becomes questionable. It 
is clearly unfeminist to judge a woman for her sexuality 
and confidence, but some question if social media is 
causing women to contribute to their own objectification. 
Even though women use social media more and use it 
as a place to build their sense of self, apps like Snapchat 
and Instagram are largely owned by males, and images 
posted by women are subjected to the male gaze without 
compensation (of course, sponsorships exist, but only 
for those with lots of followers, and not every photo is a 
sponsored deal). And we’ve all seen the terrible, cringey 
Instagram accounts that serve to only post photos of 
attractive women – most of which are through submissions 
from the women themselves. 
It would be easy to write off social media as another 
failed place of honest representation for women – or even 
blame women themselves – but the male gaze is inevitable. 
It doesn’t matter if a woman posts a seductive photo online 
or just walks down the street – she will be objectified 
either way. 
From a young age, women are taught that our bodies 
are inherently sexual. In sixth grade, I was dress-coded 
for “provocative clothing”, back when I thought a boner 
was a literal reference to a bone (so I obviously had no 
understanding of what “provocative” even meant). In 
the early summers, my soccer team sweated through 
our shirts because we weren’t allowed to play in only a 
sports bra in case a boy walked by the field (the boys were 
allowed to play with their shirts off). In high school, there 
was an online dropbox for boys to post nude photos they 
had received from girls in our town. The list goes on and 
on and on.
All forms of media will create a space for sexualized 
imaging and characterization because we are human 
and find bodies attractive. Some people know how to 
capitalize on this phenomenon and make a profit off of 
it. The question is not whether social media is holding 
us back from the social change we are seeing with more 
representation of women in the media or brands like 
Victoria’s Secret starting to lose their appeal. The question 
is how can we reconcile representations of women and 
sexuality in a way that allows for them to be their most 
sexy selves when they feel like it, or vice versa, without it 
being exploited for the male gaze and for male profit.
How can we teach a generation of young girls that 
they too can be the hero while being proud of having big 
boobs or long legs? It is not as simple as making the lead 
of an action movie a woman and dressing her in a skirt. 
Yes, it is empowering to know you can save the world in 
heels, but the reality is deeper than that. The only way to 
have complex stories that show women and our sexuality 
in a true way is by having women write and share them, 
whether it be in a Tweet or on the silver screen.

Has sex gone out of style?

I 

came from a family where we were raised with the 
wait until marriage, none of that stuff, don’t even 
think about it,” LSA senior Emma Cheff began, 
responding to the question of why she sought out prescribed 
birth control.
“And so, I didn’t really know how to get birth control. I 
didn’t know how it works — honestly, I didn’t know anything 
until I had to go through Relationship Remix, which was 
really sad.”
Her junior year, Cheff began the process of figuring out how 
to access birth control. If she relied on her parents’ insurance, 
the bills would immediately disclose the prescription, but 
paying for the contraception out of pocket was not an option.
“I’m first gen,” Cheff said. “My family doesn’t make a lot 
of money. I’m working to pay through school. I don’t have 
money to pay for birth control every month.”
Luckily, through much research, Cheff learned she could 
access birth control and stay on her parents’ insurance by 
having the billing information sent to her instead of her 
parents. She then consulted with University Health Service 
medical professionals to find the birth control that worked 
best for her. 
Contraception is widely used on the University of 
Michigan-Ann Arbor campus. According to the 2018 
National College Health Assessment administered by UHS, 
87 percent of students used some sort of contraception 
during their most recent vaginal intercourse. The usage of 
long-acting reversible contraception such as the intrauterine 
device and the implant, which are considered most effective 
due to their long-lasting and user-independent nature, are 
increasing steadily. In 2014, 10 percent of students used 
LARC during their last intercourse. This rose to 23 percent 

in 2018. 
UHS is constantly striving to make 
contraception available to students, 
as well as to help students find 
what’s right for them. They recently 
implemented video visits as an option 
for contraception consultations. For 
students who have questions about 
health insurance, they have a Managed 
Care/Student Insurance Office. 
And yet, the barriers remain. Students face financial, 
educational and cultural obstacles, stigmas about their 
sexualities and gender identities and concerns about birth 
control impacting their mental health. Each student has 
their own story — their own “unique mix of barriers,” as 
UHS health educator Laura McAndrew put it. How can UHS 
maximize support for all these students?
“I don’t have money to pay for birth control 
every month”
S

tudent 1, a Kinesiology junior who requested 
anonymity as she did not wish to publicly come out 
as queer, found herself in a bind last summer when 
her health insurance suddenly stopped covering her. 
As a person from a low-income background, Student 1 
was covered by Medicaid. But due to a glitch in the system, 
her insurance wasn’t working. She had a birth control 
prescription from UHS, but without health insurance, she 
would have to pay out of pocket. 
“I was trying to find places that were the cheapest that I 
could buy for because $20 to me is a lot of money,” Student 
1 said. “Whereas I know to some of my friends and family 
members, it’s just a drop in the bucket. But for me, the first 
prescription that I was on was $70 out of pocket per month, 
which is absurd.”
Ultimately, she managed to scrape together enough money 
to purchase the student health insurance plan. The first 
thing she did was switch to an IUD, so she would not have to 
pay for birth control consistently.
“I switched to an IUD because I don’t have to pay for it 
month after month after month,” Student 1 said. “So now I’m 
baby-free for the next five years, hopefully.”

McAndrew said UHS tries to tackle the financial barrier 
in a few ways. The costs of different contraceptive methods 
are on the UHS website, and McAndrew said students are 
welcome to visit her or other Wolverine Wellness staff to 
think through their options. If students have concerns about 
using their family’s insurance plan, UHS can put information 
about that in their after-visit summary. McAndrew further 
encouraged students without health insurance to visit the 
Managed Care Office.
Susan Ernst, chief of gynecological services at UHS, said 
one option they point patients toward is accessing birth 
control pills from local pharmacies, many of which have 
steep discounts. 
Another challenge is figuring out loopholes to get 
insurance companies to pay for contraception, Ernst said. 
She said sometimes insurance companies will pay for IUDs 
if they’re billed through the UHS pharmacy rather than 
their medical office. 
If none of these options work, Ernst said they will refer 
students to Planned Parenthood, which offers contraception 
on a sliding price scale based on income. This is best for 
students who want an IUD or implant, she said. 
“So, some of our students who have absolutely no income, 
they can get the IUD for pretty cheap,” Ernst said. 
McAndrew emphasized UHS is always looking for ways to 
improve their system.
“We know that this doesn’t account for all circumstances,” 
McAndrew said. “I would really welcome ideas about how to 
better support students with the cost barrier, because I think 
it’s really important.”
“It’s very much taboo to talk about any sort 
of sexual, reproductive birth control”
R

ackham student Jess Hernandez first went on birth 
control as an undergraduate at Michigan State 
University. She said as a Mexican American, birth 
control was a taboo topic in her household.
“I identify as Mexican American, and so, in our culture, 
it’s very much taboo to talk about any sort of sexual, 
reproductive birth control,” Hernandez said.

SEX 
SURVEY
DATA ANALYSIS BY PARTH DHYANI, ALEX 
COTIGNOLA AND TIM CHO, WEB DEVELOPERS

The Michigan Daily conducted 
their annual sex survey, which 
was completed by a total of 592 
undergraduate students across 
colleges at the University, to 
gauge knowledge and habits 
regarding sex. 39.4 percent of 
respondents identified as male, 
58.9 percent identified as 
female, 1.3 percent identified 
as non-binary, and less than 1 
percent identified as other.

The Daily was particularly 
interested in examining usage, 
knowledge and impressions 
behind 
contraceptives, 
in 
context of the role that the 
University plays in providing 
resources 
and 
information 
about contraceptives. Check 
out the results below!


Wednesday, December 11, 2019 // The Statement

 “I knew that birth control was a thing, but I thought it 
was kind of frowned upon. It wasn’t something my mom 
encouraged.”
After some research and consultation with her 
stepmom, she went to the Planned Parenthood on campus. 
She’s gone there ever since. 
“The only person who knows is my stepmom,” 
Hernandez said. “I would assume my mom knows that, 
obviously, I’m sexually active. It’s just not talked about, 
like, ‘Oh, what are you using for protection?’ And my 
stepmom is white.”
Students 
will 
approach 
getting 
contraception 
prescriptions differently based on how openly talked 
about it is in their community, McAndrew said.
“Our identities can shape the norms we experience 
related to health, sexuality and how open or taboo a topic 
sexual health is in your community,” McAndrew said. “So, 
navigating those nuances can be challenging.”
Student 1, too, came from a background where sex was 
considered taboo. She is from a small-town community 
where she said her sex education was “crap to begin with.” 
Her experience involved graphic images of STIs and being 
told that teenagers are incapable of love. 
“They concluded it with teenagers aren’t capable of 
knowing what love is,” Student 1 said. “You’re only allowed 
to have sex with people you love therefore you just can’t 
have sex. That’s what they ended it with. And I was like, 
‘What do you mean I can’t feel love?’”
She managed to get a birth control prescription to treat 
hormonal acne, but her doctor would not have prescribed 
it to her if it was for contraceptive purposes. Friends who 
were sexually active were unable to get birth control pills, 
she said. 
Her lack of knowledge in this area, Student 1 said, shows 
how crucial it is for University programs like Relationship 
Remix. 
“Having the University have the basic beginning steps 
to get everyone caught up so everyone is accountable at the 
same level of, you did learn this because you had to go,” 
Student 1 said. 
Relationship 
Remix 
includes 
information 
the 
effectiveness and availability of IUDs and implants at 
UHS, McAndrew said. But the mention of birth control is 
brief in order to make it relevant for the most students. 
“I was worried as a queer woman who 
wasn’t fully out to myself”
S

tudent 1 was initially hesitant to approach UHS for 
birth control because of her queer identity.
“I was worried as a queer woman who wasn’t 
fully out to myself even when I came here as a freshman, 
and I didn’t want to accept that part of me,” Student 1 said. 
“I was afraid that people at this University also wouldn’t be 
accepting, because I had never been in a good relationship 
with health care providers that were very out there with 
supporting the LGBTQ+ community.”
Fortunately, she had a positive experience with UHS, 
who she said have a background in treating members of 
the LGBTQ community. 
“Thankfully, the people at UHS had a good education 
on interacting with folks who don’t fit in the straight, 
(cisgender) narrative that a lot of new students here have,” 
Student 1 said. 
Student 1’s concerns are common in a healthcare 
system excluding LGBTQ patients, according to OB/GYN 

clinical lecturer Daphna Stroumsa, who specializes in 
reproductive justice and queer health. 
“The health care system is not structured appropriately 
even when there isn’t inherent transphobia,” Stroumsa 
said. “The health care system is not structured to address 
the needs of trans people because it’s structured a priori 
around cisgender heterosexual people.”
Stroumsa said LGBTQ people face barriers of stigma 
and assumption in trying to access birth control, which 
can have harmful consequences. 
“There’s often assumptions on everybody’s part about 
like, ‘Oh, if you’re gay, you’re never going to have sex with 
anyone who might get pregnant. We don’t even need to 
talk about this,’” Stroumsa said.
In the New England Journal of Medicine, Stroumsa 
led a study examining the case of a transgender man who 
came into the emergency room of a hospital with lower 
abdominal pain. The hospital attributed the pain to him 
not taking blood pressure medication. Several hours later, 
they learned he was pregnant, but no fetal heartbeat was 
detected. 
Ernst mentioned this study as a catalyst that led UHS 
to improve care offered to trans and non-binary students. 
UHS has a Trans Care Team specifically devoted to these 
students with clinicians who have undergone extensive 
training. 
Ernst also said UHS focuses on making language during 
consultations as inclusive as possible. One way of doing 
this is asking students to describe the ways in which they 
have sex rather than assuming penetrative, vaginal sex. 
“It’s really like what parts go where when people are 

having sexual activity,” Ernst said. “We don’t judge who’s 
doing what but just what activities are happening, so that 
we can make sure that they’re safe and protected in any 
way that they’re having sex.”
Stroumsa said their experience with the intersection of 
gender identity and health care was completely different 
as a student. 
“I came of age in a world in which talking about gender 
identity and sexuality with health care providers in an 
open way was unthinkable,” Stroumsa said. “I’m glad to 
see the world slowly moving to a different place, and I 
want to keep the momentum of that change going.”
“If this were a different medical condition, 
if it didn’t have to do with my reproductive 
system, would they believe me more?” 
S

tudent 2, an LSA sophomore who requested 
anonymity for medical privacy, decided to go to 
UHS for birth control her freshman year. For the 
next year, she suffered mental health issues she felt that 
UHS did not take into account. 
When she went in for her consultation, she mentioned 
her history of severe menstrual symptoms. Since she’d had 
these issues throughout high school, she had normalized 
them, she said.
The UHS nurse practitioner told her birth control would 
likely help with her symptoms, lessening her cramps 
and flow. The practitioner gave Student 2 Tri Sprintec, a 
widely prescribed birth control pill. Immediately, Student 
2 started feeling worse. 
“I didn’t sleep for weeks, like I was getting two or three

hours of sleep a night,” Student 2 said. “I was doing really 
poorly in a class that I shouldn’t have been just because my 
brain didn’t seem to work. And I was picking fights with 
my roommate and with my boyfriend. Something was 
wrong physically.”
She called UHS and was told to give herself some more 
time to adjust. When symptoms hadn’t improved after 
a month, she called again and was given a different pill. 
But there was no change. When she approached UHS 
again, the clinician she spoke to told her she should see a 
psychiatrist. 
“She was like, ‘I don’t know what your home life is like, 
maybe you should see a psychiatrist,’” Student 2 said. 
“They were like, ‘It’s probably in your head, and we don’t 
believe you that this is something wrong with your body. 
We don’t believe that it’s our fault for prescribing you this 
birth control’ … and that was so dismissive.”
So, she kept taking it. She said her relationship with 
alcohol spiraled, and her anxiety worsened. She cried 
easily, even randomly, at things that would not normally 
trigger tears. She tried going off the birth control, but her 
cramps that month were so bad she was forced to miss 
work. 
Student 2 went back to UHS and saw a doctor affiliated 
with Michigan Medicine. They had a long, extensive 
conversation about her symptoms and her family’s 
medical history. The doctor ultimately diagnosed her 
with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which the birth 
control was exacerbating.
“She was like, ‘You don’t have a mental health disorder. 
You have PMDD, a very severe case of it,’” Student 2 said. 
“During the luteal phase of your periods, the second 
two weeks after you ovulate … I have a genetically 
inherited protein abnormality in my brain that triggers 
an abnormal response to hormones. It’s very easy to treat 
with medication.”
After a journey of a little over a year, Student 2 is 
finally feeling better. The doctor she met with prescribed 
her medication to treat her PMDD, and she’s on birth 
control that’s specific to her condition. Studies have not 
established a consensus on whether people with PMDD 
and premenstrual syndrome are harmed or helped by 
birth control.
Student 2 said while she appreciated how willing UHS 
was to prescribe her birth control and how progressive 
the women’s clinic is in general, she didn’t feel like she 
was taken seriously in this instance. 
“All it took was the (the Michigan Medicine doctor) 
listening and saying these experiences are not normal and 
you shouldn’t feel that way,” Student 2 said. “Having a girl 
tell a nurse or a doctor, ‘Oh, my birth control is making 
me cry a lot.’ That’s not normal. And then being like, ‘Oh, 
it’s probably just you. You don’t know what you’re talking 
about?’”
Ernst said UHS practitioners always note the side 
effects birth control may cause during contraception 
consultations. Sometimes patients will experience mood 
changes, but usually these symptoms resolve over time. If 
patients have follow-up concerns, they’re encouraged to 
call or reach out through the patient portal. 
“We explain that there are many different formulations 
of hormonal contraception and if they don’t tolerate the 
one we started, we can always change them to another 
method that works better for them,” Ernst said.
Student 2 has been thinking a lot more about the 
intersection of reproductive health and mental health, 

especially after learning of the high suicide rates linked to 
PMDD. Student 2 said she’s thankful she figured it out, but 
still wonders why she didn’t get the right medical advice 
the first time around. She said the lack of conversation and 
understanding about mental health and contraception was 
a big barrier for her. 
“If this were a different medical condition, if it didn’t 
have to do with my reproductive system, would they 
believe me more?” Student 2 said. 
“I wish that nobody had to worry about the 
cost of contraception” 
E

rnst said in a better world, no one would have 
to worry about the cost of contraception. 
Many insurance companies have arbitrary 
requirements regarding contraception, she said. 
“You’re just putting up barriers so that people can’t get 
the care that they need. I would say that drives me insane,” 
Ernst said. “I really wish there was universal health care, 
because everyone deserves the same care. Everyone 
deserves to have the best care that they need.”
McAndrew said UHS builds their systems to address 
issues most students are facing, while also trying to 
address individual student needs. This is something they 
continue to work on, she said. 
“Unfortunately, there are some times when we can’t 

do everything that we want to do for somebody, and that 
is challenging, and that’s difficult, and it’s frustrating,” 
McAndrew said. “So, we just try to put our heads together 
about what is the best possible scenario we can make 
possible for this person.”
Jennifer Villavicencio, clinical lecturer in obstetrics and 
gynecology, said the best practice is to make clear what 
services are offered in a compassionate, nonjudgmental 
way. She emphasized that contraception is extraordinarily 
safe, but that it’s not a one-size-fits-all model. UHS has 
the power to make their services even more accessible to 
students, she said, and they should use that power. 
“Those who have power always have the ability to 
use that power for good, and for equalizing and moving 
towards equity,” Villavicencio said. 
Cheff is already using her power for good. She’s helping 
a friend with similar circumstances — strict parents, 
inability to pay for birth control on her own — navigate her 
contraception options. 
“She’s scared because she wants the birth control,” 
Cheff said. “She’s really scared because she’s not in a state 
to have a child, obviously. So, I’m helping her saying, ‘This 
is what I did, this is how it worked out for me. Whatever I 
can do to make it easier for you so that you can be safe and 
still enjoy what you’re doing.’”
