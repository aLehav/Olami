FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
Obama picks
'U' dean for
science board

ON DISPLAY

Deborah
Loewenberg Ball
appointed to
advisory body
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
When Deborah Loewenberg
Ball, the dean of the School of
Education, heard her phone
ring last May, she almost didn't
answer.
The caller ID read
"unknown," usually a sign of
telemarketers, but she picked
up, anyway. The White House
Office of Appointments and
Scheduling was on the line.
President Barack Obama
announced Ball's appointment
to the National Science Board, a
body that governs the National
Science Foundation and advis-
es the president and Congress
on science and mathematics
research, last week.
"I am honored that these tal-
ented individuals have decided
to join this administration and
serve our country," Obama said
in a statement. "I look forward
to working with them in the
months and years to come."
As part of the 25-member
board composed of professors,
deans and organization presi-
dents from across the country,
Ball said she is looking forward
to contributing her experience
in the fields of education and

mathematics.
"It's exciting," Ball said. "It's
not somethingyou expect at all.
And it's just a terrific honor to
be asked to do something of this
kind."
At the University, Ball is the
William ,H. Payne Collegiate
Professor of Education, an
Arthur F. Thurnau professor,
and a research professor at the
Institute for Social Research.
Ball also founded Teaching
Works, a program founded
to improve teacher education
across the nation. As part of
this program, she continues to
teach mathematics to elemen-
tary school students every
summer.
"That keeps me grounded in
the realities of some of the chal-
lenges of helping even pretty.
young children learn math-
ematics," she said.
Whether in the classroom
with elementary school stu-
dents during her 15-year stint
as a mathematics teacher, or on
the Michigan Council for Edu-
cator Effectiveness, a commit-
tee created by Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder to design Michi-
gan's teacher evaluation sys-
tem, Ball is often looked to as a
leader in the field.
University Provost Philip
Hanlon, who has worked with
Ball on projects such as Teach-
ing Works, praised Ball for her
knowledge, insight and vision.
"I'm not surprised President
Obama tapped her," he said. "As

INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS
Big Ten ,ad..,ds M\.arylan1d

Rutgers expected
to become league's
14th team today
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
The Big Ten keeps getting big-
ger. The University of Maryland
Board of Regents voted Monday

to accept an invitation toleave the
ACC and become the 13th mem-
ber of the Big Ten Conference.
Rutgers is expected to follow suit
on Tuesday.
Maryland, one of the eight
founding members of the ACC in
1953, will be an official member of
the Big Ten beginning July1, 2014
and will begin competition in the
conference in the 2014-2015 aca-
demic year.

The move was announced at a
press conference Monday after-
noon in College Park, Md. with
University of Maryland Presi-
dent Wallace Loh, Brit Kirwan,
University System of Maryland
Chancellor, Maryland athletic
director Kevin Anderson and Big
Ten commissioner Jim Delaney
present.
In his opening remarks, Loh
declared the transition to the Big

Ten a "watershed" moment for
the Terrapins.
"Membership in the Big Ten
Conference is in the strate-
gic interest of the University of
Maryland," Loh said. "It will not
only ensure the financial vitality
of Maryland athletics for decades
to come, but the extensive oppor-
tunities in the CIC for collabo-
rations with our peer AAU and

DO THE GOBBLE

Nightly check-ins by house council

75 years ago this week
(November 20,1937):
Alice C. Lloyd, then-University
dean of women, and Martha Ray,
then-social director of Mosher
Jordan Residence Hall, defended
a monitoring system in the all-
female Mosher Hall, The Michi-
gan Daily reported.
In this system, four female stu-
dents were hired to "visit each
room between 10:30 p.m. and 11:45
p.m., and see that the residents are
in their rooms and quiet." After
the Mosher house council passed
the resolution on the recommen-
dation from Lloyd's office, certain
residents protested it as "regimen-
tation" and "spying," according to
the Daily.
CRIME NOTES

50 years ago this week
(November 18,1962):
At a lecture sponsored by the
Center for Research on Conflict
Resolution, Arthur Waskow, then-
member of the Peace Research
Institute in Washington, told Uni-
versity students that accidental
nuclear war was a distinct possi-
bility, the Daily reported.
25 years ago this week
(November 25,1987):
Students planned a protest of
the Central Intelligence Agency
during a campus visit by the orga-
nizatign to recruit graduating
seniors into its ranks, the Daily
reported.
Previous attempts to recruit

at the University also brought
controversy. In 1984, protest-
ers disrupted a CIA presentation
and chased its recruiters from
the Modern Language Building,
according to the Daily.
Then-Graduate student Phillis
Engelbert said-he was upset with
the work of the CIA in toppling
other democratic governments
and did not want them on campus.
"I don't have a lot of sympathy
for students who want interviews
(with the CIA)," Engelbert said.
"It's like asking, 'Don't you feel
Nazis have the right to recruit?'
These people have no regard for
human rights and lives."

Israel, Hamas trade fire
despite cease-fire talks

Rocket firings,
airstrikes continue
as truce talks fail
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
- Israel and Gaza's Hamas rul-
ers traded fire and tough cease-
fire proposals Monday, and
threatened to escalate their bor-
der conflict if diplomacy fails. No
deal appeared near.
An Israeli airstrike targeting a
Gaza media center killed a senior
militant and engulfed the build-
ing in flames. The Israeli mili-
tary said the Islamic Jihad were
using space there as a command
center.
Gaza fighters fired 95 rockets
at southern Israeli cities, nearly
one-third of them intercepted by
an Israeli missile shield.
A total of 38 Palestinians were
killed Monday. Two more Pales-
tinians were killed in airstrikes
past midnight, bringing the

death toll since the start of Isra-
el's offensive to 111, including 56
civilians. Some 840 people have
been wounded, including 225
children, Gaza heath officials
said. Three Israeli civilians have
been killed and dozens have been
wounded.
Over the weekend, civilian
casualties in Gaza rose sharply
after Israel began targeting the
homes of what it said were sus-
pected militants.
Two such strikes late Mon-
day killed five people - a father
and his 4-year-old twin sons in
northern Gazaand two people in
the south, medics said.
Jamal Daloo, who lost his
wife, a son, four grandchildren
and five other members of his
family in an attack Sunday, sat
in quiet mourning Monday next
to the ruins of his home, his face
streaked with tears.
"The international public
opinion witnessed the facts," he
said, speaking as his 16-year-old

nnmciuu

daughter, Yara, was still missing
under the rubble being cleared
away by bulldozers. "This does
not require my words."
The Israeli military says Gaza
militants fire rockets from resi-
dential areas. Late Monday it
released footage it said showed
was a miliant weapons depot
hidden in a Gaza neighborhood.
Egypt, the traditional media-
tor between Israel and the Arab
world, was at the center of a flur-
ry of diplomatic activity Monday.
Egyptian intelligence officials
met separately in Cairo with an
Israeli envoy and with Khaled
Mashaal, the top Hamas leader
in exile.
Hamas wants Israel to halt
all attacks on Gaza and lift tight
restrictions on trade and move-
ment in and out of the territory
that have been in place since
Hamas seized Gaza by force in
2007. Israel demands an end to
rocket fire from Gaza and a halt
to weapons smuggling into Gaza
through tunnels under the bor-
der with Egypt.
With positions far apart on a
comprehensive deal, some close
to the negotiations suggested
Egypt is first seeking a halt to
fighting before other conditions
are discussed. They spoke on
condition of anonymity because
the talks are in a sensitive stage.
Mashaal told reporters that
Hamas would only agree to a
cease-fire if its demands are
met. "We don't accept Israeli
conditions because it is the
aggressor," he said. "We want
a cease-fire along with meeting
our demands."
Mashaal also suggested that
Israel's threat of invading Gaza
was simply a ploy. He said Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu "is waving the threat of a
ground offensive and asking the
world to pressure Egypt, Tur-
key and Qatar, so they pressure
Hamas."
"He wants to negotiate with
us under fire to impose his con-
ditions, pretending he is acting
from a position of strength,"
Mashaal said.

Visits to Myanmar, Cambodia,

Tours mark first-
ever visits by sitting
president
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
(AP) - On a history-making
trip, President Barack Obama
on Monday paid the first visit
by an American leader to Myan-
mar and Cambodia, two Asian
countries with troubled histo-
ries, one on the mend and the
other still a cause of concern.
Obama's fast-paced, pre-
Thanksgiving trip vividly illus-
trated the different paths the
regional neighbors are taking to
overcome legacies of violence,
poverty and repression.
Cheered by massive flat-
waving crowds, Obama offered
long-isolated Myanmar a "hand
of friendship" as it rapidly
embraces democratic reforms.
Hours later, he arrived in Cam-
bodia to little fanfare, then
pointedly criticized the coun-
try's strongman leader on the
issue of human rights during a
tense meeting.
Obama was an early cham-
pion of Myanmar's sudden
transformation to civilian rule
following a half-century of mil-
itary dictatorship. He's reward-

ed the country, also known as
Burma, with eased economic
penalties, increased U.S. invest-
ment and now a presidential
visit, in part to show other
nations the benefits of pursuing
similar reforms.
"You're taking a journey that
has the potential to inspire so
many people," Obama sdid dur-
ing a speech at Myanmar's Uni-
versity of Yangon.
The Cambodians are among
those Obama is hoping will be
motivated. White House offi-
cials said he held up Myan-
mar, a once-pariah state, as a
benchmark during his private
meeting Monday evening with
.Prime Minister Hun Sen, the
autocratic Cambodian leader
who has held power for nearly
30 years. Hun Sen's rivals have
sometimes ended up in jail or in
exile.
Unlike the arrangement after
Obama's meetings with Myan-
mar's President Thein Sein and
democracy leader. Aung Sun
Suu Kyi, the U.S. and Cambodi-
an leaders did not speak to the
press following their one-on-
one talks. They did step before
cameras briefly before their
meeting to greet each other
with a brisk handshake and lit-
tle warmth.

In private, U.S. officials said,
Obama pressed Hun Sen to
release political prisoners, stop
land seizures and hold free and
fair elections. Aides acknowl-
edged the meeting was tense,
with the Cambodian leader
defending his practices, even
as he professed to seek a deeper
relationship with the U.S.
Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy
national security adviser, said
the president told Hun Sen that
without reforms, Cambodia's
human rights woes would con-
tinue to be "an impediment" to
that effort.
White House officials
emphasized that Obama would
not have visited Cambodia had
it not been hosting two region-
al summit meetings the U.S.
attends, a rare admonishment
of a country on its own soil.
The Cambodian people
appeared to answer Obama's
cold shoulder in kind. Just a few
small clusters of curious Cam-
bodians gathered on the streets
to watch his motorcade speed
though the streets of Phnom
Penh.
A welcome sign did greet
Obama upon his arrival - but it
heralded Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao, not the American presi-
dent.

A judge granted a prosecutor's
request to drop a rape case Mon-

was immediately released from
custody after nearly a decade in

James Grissom, 54, shook as
he thanked the judge. He has
 maintained his innocence since
his photo was picked from among
thousands of police photos in
2002, 18 months after the alleged
attack outside a Meijer store in St.

Despite no physical evidence or

15 years in prison. After the trial,
new evidence emerged that the
woman had lied about as many as
nine assaults in California.

The International Court of Jus-

also granted Nicaragua control of
a large swath of the surrounding
sea and seabed that could hold oil
reserves.
The decision not to grant
Colombia full sovereignty over
the waters connecting all the
archipelago's islands drew a vehe-
ment objection from Colombia's
president.
Based on evidence presented
to the judges by lawyers for both
nations, "Colombia and not Nica-
ragua has sovereignty over the
islands," the court's President

Peter Tomka told delegations
from both sides.

Aussie fake-bomb
plotter sentenced
to 13.5 years
An Australian investment
banker who admitted chaining a
fake bomb to a Sydney teenager
as part of a bizarre extortion plot
was sentenced to 13 years and six
months jail Tuesday.
Madeleine Pulver, then 18,
was studying at home alone in
her family's mansion in August
2011 when Paul Douglas Peters
walked in wearing a rainbow-
striped ski mask and carrying
a baseball bat. He tethered a
bomb-like device to her neck
along with a ransom note and
then slipped away, leaving the
panicked teen alone. It took a
bomb squad 10 hours to remove
the device, which contained no
explosives.
At the sentencing, Judge Peter
Zahra said Peters intended to put
the fear into the young victim
that she would be killed.

flagship universities in education,
research, and innovation will
boost the University of Mary-
land's ascendancy in academic
excellence."
After approval from the Mary-
land Board of Regents, the Big
Ten Council of Presidents unani-
mously approved Maryland on
Monday morning. Delaney said
the counciliwas "giddy" to receive
the Terrapins' application.
"Some people fear the turtle,"
Delaney said. "We embrace the
turtle."
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, a member of the Coun-
cil of Presidents, knows Loh well
from his time serving as provost
at the University of Iowa from
2008-2010 and Kirwan from his
tenure as The Ohio State Univer-
sity president from 1998-2002.
"We have enormous respect
for the University of Maryland,
and we think that this is going
to be a very good alliance over
time," Coleman said.
The transition to the Big Ten
is seen as a largely financial deci-
sion for both parties. Maryland
has faced severe cutbacks due
to a multi-million dollar bud-
get deficit in recent years. It has
also eliminated seven varsity
programs - men's and women's
swimming, men's cross country,
men's indoor track, acrobatics
and tumbling, men's tennis and
women's water polo.
Loh said sitting down with
Anderson to explain which teams
would be cut was "perhaps the
most painful thing we'll ever have
to do."
"No future Maryland athletic
director will ever have to look in
young men and young women's
eyes and say you can't compete,
you can't wear the colors of the
school, because we can't support
you financially," Anderson added.
The Big Ten has the most
lucrative television contract in
college athletics, with each mem-
ber receiving $24 million cut last
year. The Big Ten Network could

earn up to an additional $200
million if it were added to basic
cable packages in Washington,
D.C. and New York City with the
addition of Rutgers and Mary-
land, according to ESPN.
"The membership of the Big
Ten enables us to guarantee the
financial sustainability of Mary-
land athletics for a long, long,
long time," Loh said, adding that
the athletic department had'
been surviving "paycheck to pay-
check."
Maryland also faces a $50 mil-
lion .exit fee to leave the ACC,
though the school is in negotia-
tions to lower the fee.
Maryland senior Andy Magee
- a member of the men's tennis
team that had its funding cut last
summer - said in a telephone
interview that the staggering fig-
ures have raised some eyebrows.
He said the response from Ter-
rapins students as "all negative,
100-percent negative."
"All my friends are pretty
much athletes," Magee said. "And
they are saying they came hero to
play in the ACC and not to go play
in the Big Ten. A lot of it is just
money-driven and, 'We just cut
sports, how are we getting this
money?' It's not overly excite-
ment."
Loh clarified later that Mary-
land intends to reinstate some of
the disbanded programs with the
increased revenue gained from
joining the Big Ten. Maryland
now fields eight men's and 10
women's programs.
Maryland has now become one
of two schools to leave the ACC.
South Carolina was the other,
leavingin 1971 tobecome an inde-
pendent; the Gamecocks are now
members of the SEC.
"Our best wishes are extended
to all of the people associated
with the University of Maryland.
Since our inception, they have
been an outstanding member of
our conference and we are sorry
to see them exit," ACC commis-
sioner John Swofford said in a
statement.
Maryland journalism senior
Eric Morrow said the Terrapins
will be an "interesting fit" in the

Big Ten.
"It's probably the most south-
ern out of all the schools, but I
think it will be a good match,"
Morrow said. "I think it will be a
good experience. My dad always
joked that I would end up going
to a Big Ten school, and here we
are."
"Iunderstand why we're doing
it, but I think a lot of people are
sad to see change come," added
Maryland communications and
public relations junior Caroline
Niski, "but a lot of times it's just
something that's inevitable."
Michigan has had little expo-
sure to Maryland in the athlet-
ics landscape. The football teams
played three times between
1985 and 1990, with the Wolver-
ines winning all three contests.
The Terrapins have an all-time
4-44-1 record against Big Ten
opponents, with most of those
appearances up against Pennsyl-
vania State University.
Maryland and Rutgers will
join the Big Ten Leaders Division,
while Illinois will move into the
Legends Division, ESPN reported.
With a dte with undefeated
Ohio State on the docket this Sat-
urday, Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke stayed mum on the
conference expansion.
"Right, now, I think Ohio may
be a little more important," Hoke
said at his Monday press confer-
ence.
Michigan athletic director
Dave Brandon said the expansion
helps Michigan expand to reach
alums and fans in the Baltimore-
Washington market. He feels
Maryland was a good fit for the
conference.
"Although we're very proud of
our Midwest-centric tradition,
there's a lot of growth, in fact
more growth, in other regions
of the country and the fact that
we're moving into some of those
areas over the long haul will be
very positive for this conference,"
Brandon told the Detroit Free
Press.

RESEARCH
From Page 1
San Francisco.
Chan explained that axons,
a part of nerve cells essential
for nervous system functioning,
need to be insulated by myelin,
a protective material made by
other types of body cells, in order
to work efficiently.
"If you look at any type of
wire, it's covered by some type
of insulation. If you look at any
power cord, it has this sheath
that surrounds it and this is simi-
lar to what myelin is," Chan said.
"In the nervous system we have
axons that transmit electrical
signals throughout the nervous
system."
Corey said that his lab pro-
duced nanofibers - man-made,
synthetic fibers with properties
mimicking axons - and Chan's
lab ran the biological experi-
ments with those fibers. They
discovered that the nanofibers
with a larger diameter are more
likely to naturally be myelinated.
"We've known for a long time
that axons - these cables of the
nerve cells that corlduct electric-
ity from one cable to another - if
they are particularly large, are
myelinated," Corey said. "The
truth of the matter is that we
have never known why that's the
case."
The research specifically
looked at the sensitivity of oligo-
dendrocytes - cells found in the
brain and spinal cord that are
one type of myelinating cell - in
response to physical properties
of nanofiber diameter.
"The whole idea here is to
understand the basic environ-
ment that is conducive for the

cells to form myelin," Chan said.
"Ifwe canget any cluesorinsight
into the way the cells form this
myelin, we might have ways to
repair the nervous system after
demyelination - like in (multi-
ple sclerosis) where the immune
system attacks the myelin."
Corey stressed that he was
able to conduct the research due
to his background in biomedical
engineering and neurology that
allowed him to design nanofi-
bers in a way never attempted
before.
Sam Tuck, a University alum
and member of the research
team, said that as a biology
major, he was seeking a job in a
laboratory when his aunt, who
went to college with Corey, told
him about the opening.
"Just recently (our research
has) been getting all this cool
recognition," Tuck said. "It's
something I definitely never
found myself getting into
because it's a much more mate-
rial science (than biology)."
Tuck primarily conducted
electrospinning in the lab, a
process that involves dissolv-
ing plastic pellets and applying
electrostatic force to the solution
until fibers form and collect.
"It's something that you often
have to repeat over and over
again because it's such a finicky
process," Tuck said.
He said, until Corey's lab,
he had never heard of electro-
spinning being utilized for tis-
sue research, adding that he has
since seen many schools start-
ing to use the process in tissue
research.
"There's a lot of promise for
stem cell research," he said. "It's
not limited to just nerve regen-
eration."



AATA
From Page 1
upcoming changes.,t
AATA CEO Michael Ford said
at the event that the renovation is
the result of years of planning.
"We began nearly three years
ago with an investment for an
$8-million facility. We are on the
brink of that reality right now,"
Ford said. "This groundbreaking
is the latest in a series of positive
developments for AATA."
Ford added that the changes to
the center are needed to accom-
modate riders and to update the
facility.
"The new Blake Transit Cen-
ter will provide residents with
a modern, clean and visually
appealing structure," Ford said.
"The new ... center is necessary
to meet the projected ridership
increases intheverynear future."
According to AATA plans, the
new center will be more than
twice the size of the current cen-
ter, making it more spacious for
users. While the existing building
has only one floor, the new center
will have two floors as well as a
basement. The upper floor will
be designed to give bus drivers a
space to relax between routes.
Al Thomas, an AATA staff
member, said the new spaces for
employees are welcomed.
"I think for myself, personally
it's exciting that this is happen-
ing," Thomas said. "Not only is
it expanding a space, it's giving
the drivers and operators a better
place to sit back and take a break
and eat lunch."
The new structure will also
feature a larger space for a cus-
tomer service lobby, offices for
AATA and getDowntown staff
members, additional restrooms,
COUNCIL
From Page 1
cilmember Marcia Higgins
(D-Ward 4) was added to the
agenda midway through the
meeting. Higgins said the sus-
pension would give time for
Council to decide how the city
shouldhandle the funding of
public art.
Immediately following a
meeting recess, however, it was
decided to postpone the less
than an hour-old ordinance for
two weeks.

a staff break room and a base-
ment for storage and mechanical
equipment.
The transit center will also be
moved to the opposite side of the
street in order to redirect traf-
fic flow and allow the use of the
current transit center as long as
possible while the update is con-
structed.
Additionally, it will include
heated sidewalks, which will
reduce the use of salt in the win-
ters to melt snow.
The increase in size is large-
ly a response to the uptick in
AATA passengers. According to
an AATA report, "ridership has
increased more than 60 percent
since 1987, with more than 5,000
riders arriving and departing
daily through the Blake."
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje agreed in his address to the
crowd that the congestion on the
AATA has been an issue.
"As new people come to work
in our city, we have to have a
better way to get them here, and
unless we're able to improve
transit we are faced with a future
of more and more congestion and
air pollution," Hieftje said.
Hieftje added that he hopes
to encourage people visit-
ing Ann Arbor to reduce their
use of automobiles by offering
improved public transportation
systems.
Nancy Shore, the director of
Ann Arbor's getDowntown pro-
gram, said the Federal Transit
Authority granted $2.7 million
for the project under specified
stipulations.
"The FTA asked for a certain
number of disadvantaged enter-
prises'as well as small business
to be a part of this project, so we
have companies that are smaller
businesses that we are working
Early in the meeting, how-
ever, the Council spent con-
siderable time discussing an
ordinance that would change
how the living wage ordinance
affects city contractors.
The proposed ordinance
would increase the minimum
value of a contract between the
city andaecontractorthat would
cause the living wage law to
come into effect from $10,000
to $25,000 per contract. It
would have also allowed non-
profit companies that work for
the city to be exempt from the
living wage law.

with," Shore said. "They asked
for a portion of the business to
be dedicated to public art, so
that is something else we are
incorporating."
AATA plans also show the
structure will meet U.S. Green
Building Council's LEED Gold
Certification sustainable stan-
dards as an environmentally
friendly building due to its use of
durable, low-maintenance mate-
rials including recycled material.
The center will aim to accom-
modate passengers with dis-
abilities, unlike the current
transit center, according to
AATA board member Jesse Ber-
nstein. An elevator will make
the new structure more acces-
sible to those with disabilities,
and help make the center com-
pliant with the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
Bernstein added that the
AATA hopes to work with Uni-
versity buses to incorporate the
two transit systems.
"We have been working more
closely with University of Mich-
igan Transit people than ever
before," Bernstein. "We are at a
point where we can have some
open discussion about sharing,
like we did at the Central Cam-
pus bus station, where you get
AATA and U of M buses. I can
see us doing similar things here
and bringing students in."
Ann Arbor resident Roy
Mann, one of the few residents
at the event, said he came to see
what the new building would
look like and how it would affect
the flow of traffic.
"It does need updating,"
Mann said, in reference to the
current center. "I think the new
transit center is going to work
out pretty good. The new design
looks great."
Ultimately, the ordinance
was postponed as the Council
voted to put the ordinance on
a second read for a later meet-
ing.
Council also unanimously
approved an ordinance clos-
ing off streets for Festifools -
an annual arts parade held in
April- as well as an agreement
with the University's Board of
Regents that will allow the
University to lay wire below
the Ronald McDonald house,
an organization that houses
families with relatives staying
the University hospital.

Ball will continue the tradition
of service to our nation by U of

While the National Board
of Science is broader in scope
than Ball's previous member-
ship on the.National Board for
Education Sciences, her new
appointment will still contain an
educational component.
She said she hopes to build
connections between research
funding and improving the
education system in the United
States, since her background in
the field of education is unique
among the board members.

"Whenever I've had opportu-
nities inthe past to interact with
scientists and mathematicians,
it adds a great deal to what we
do in the School of Education by
making the connections back
and forth between research and
practice and what we do to try
to improve education for young
people," Ball said.
She added that she expects
the appointment will benefit
the University.
"The University of Michigan
is a huge player in research,"
Ball said. "I think that I will
learn things about the kinds
of priorities the National Sci-
ence Foundation is making
and things that might help us
improve the kinds of priorities
we are setting here."

*STEM surplus
More emphasis needed on other fields of study
The University boasts one of the strongest engineering
programs in the country: ranked seventh by U.S. News
and World Report in 2012. Last Thursday, the University
received a $2 million dollar grant to support science, technology,
engineering and math students. While the University and country
have great interest in promoting graduates in STEM fields, it's also
necessary to recognize other fields of study that may develop simi-

The deal on Black Friday

Black Friday has both its ori-
gins and its growth in our
consumer-driven culture,
and there's noth-
ing wrong with
that. But we have
to remember that Â«
our choices as
consumers have h
far-reaching
effects on others.
Over the last
decade, con- JAMES
sumers have BRENNAN
decided that
they don't want
to wait until Thanksgiving is over
to start holiday shopping. This year,
Toys-"R"-Us, Wal-Mart, Sears and
K-Mart will open their doors at 8:00
p.m. on Thursday, while Target will
allow shoppers in at 9:00 p.m.
Sound ridiculous? Well, retail
giants are only able to rip peo-
ple away from their families on
Thanksgiving evening because it
works. This phenomenon is con-
sumer-driven. The problem is not
that the retailers employ this strat-
egy, but that it works. And every
year, it starts earlier and becomes
even busier than before.
Being a flaming anti-consumerist,
it irks me to hear that people will
shop on Thanksgiving before they
even have time to enjoy the inevi-
table food coma. But this column
isn't about the problems I have with
American materialism or conspicu-
ous consumption. What concerns me
most about these insanely early sales
is the effect on retail workers.
With stores opening so early,
employees will barely have time to
wrap up their leftovers before their
shifts begin. Shopping on Thanks-
giving is completely voluntary
- working isn't quite the same. Pro-
tests have already begun regarding
these Miore demanding schedules.

An online petition asking Target,
Wal-Mart and other retailers to
give employees all of Thanksgiving
off has gathered more than 340,000
signatures.
As encouraging as that is, a store
like Wal-Mart doesn't respond to sig-
natures - it responds to money.
People often forget that when they
spend money, they are essentially
voting. Buying a product expresses
your approval of that product, and
buying it from a certain store con-
fers your agreement with that store.
So long as you keep spending money
there, that company will stay in busi-
ness and will generate profit. Wal-
Mart is notorious for mistreating
employees, selling imported goods
and running small businesses out of
town. But people love the low prices,
so they keep the convenience con-
glomerate in business.
Black Friday is the epitome of the
United States' moral failure: Self-
ishness is now a virtue in Ameri-
can society. Ignore the fact that
hundreds of female employees have
filed lawsuits against Wal-Mart
for discrimination. Ignore the fact
that employees all over the country
will have to leave their families on
a national holiday. And ignore the
fact that retail giants rake in bil-
lions in profits but pay their employ-
ees a wage that's barely livable. The
American consumer benefits, so it's
all good.
I'm not trying to rally against
capitalism here. I'm making a point
about work in America. There are
major injustices committed against
our neighbors regularly that we
have the power to stop. Suppose a
few million people who were going
to shop at Wal-Mart on Black Fri-
day refused, as a way of standing in
solidarity with the striking employ-
ees. Their business loss would be
significant. Now imagine that lasts

for months. Wal-Mart would begin
labor negotiations and the problems
of poor working conditions and
low pay could be resolved. As con-
sumers in this system, we hold the
power. It will force us to sacrifice:
Personally, my family is strapped
for cash and we need to stretch
things as far as we can.
Our consumer
choices have
far-reaching
effects.
Regardless, we never have and
never will shop at a Wal-Mart. We
refuse to support a business that
does what they do. It hurts us, but
we make that sacrifice in the hope
of influencing a change.
As consumers, we need to under-
stand what spending our money
means. our purchases will decide
when people work, how much they
get paid and whether or not they
deserve equal treatment because of
their gender.
I propose something very simple:
if you want to help retail workers all
over the country, then don't go shop-
ping at 8:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving.
Send a message to businesses that
they can't do this to their employ-
ees. Go and enjoy the deals if you'd
like, but just remember that at one
point, you'll be at a register looking
into the eyes of a person who had to
leave Thanksgiving dinner early just
to ring you up. Personally, I would
rather stay home, eat some pumpkin
pie and watch more football.

s

lar. impoTtance or economic relev
The National Science Foundation funds a
grant for a high school to college transition
program aimed at establishing M-STEM
academies at the University for a five-year
period. The University has pledged to expand
its STEM programs to attract a more diverse
group of undergraduates and award more
STEM degrees.
The grant the University received is an
impacting contribution to world-renowned
program in the sciences. STEM fields are a
weak point of American education and cer-
tainly deserves advocates. Post-graduation,
STEM degrees can be highly profitable and
important, while funding provides a resource
of interested high school students.
However, there are many other areas of
study that are essential. The ability to read
critically, write clearly and form effective
arguments will always be necessary skills
for any job. These are skills that are heav-
ily emphasized in liberal arts programs. An
average person will change their career five
to seven times in their lifetime. A liberal arts
program provides the platform necessary to

learn skills that are a necessity to the ever-
changing job market, and can work in con-
junction with other fields.
While the grant for the STEM programs
is enormously beneficial, this emphasis
shouldn't be at the expense of other aca-
demic fields. There should be equal incentive
for high school students to join every field of
study in higher education, as diverse educa-
tional backgrounds makes for more knowl-
edgeable world citizens. With a shift toward
only STEM degrees, the liberal arts and edu-
cation fields could eventually receive less
funding, negatively impacting the students
who choose to study these fields.
Promoting STEM degrees in under-rep-
resented groups should be applauded. The
future of higher education, however, depends
on every discipline taught at the University.
The overall purpose of higher education is to
teach students how to think critically about
the world. We cannot be successful mem-
bers of an ever-changing society unless our
graduates are well-rounded and come from a
series of diverse fields.

Last week, I had the opportunity to
attend the Jewish Federations of North
America's General Assembly in Baltimore,
where more than 3,000 Jews from around
North America gathered to discuss the cur-
rent state of Judaism.
The loose theme of the event was Tik-
kun Olam, Hebrew for "repairing the world,"
which is one of the most important tenets of
Judaism. For us, Tikkun Olam means leaving
the world abetter place than you found it.
In one of the opening sessions, I heard
amazing speakers talk about inspiring work
being done by the Jewish community in places
such as Rwanda and Haiti. I heard about how
my community mobilized during Hurricane
Sandy relief. These acts are commendable and
should be praised - but that wasn't why I went
to Baltimore.
I went to Baltimore hoping to discuss how
my Jewish and Israeli identities are struggling
with one another. I went to Baltimore to figure
out how the conflict fits into my Jewish values.
I went to talk about Palestinians.
As a Jew, I feel a strong connection to the
state of Israel. As a liberal and someone who
believes in undeniable, universal equality,
I feel a strong moral imperative to fight for
human rights for everyone, regardless of
which side of a border they live on. Increas-
ingly, I feel that my liberal, Jewish and demo-
cratic beliefs are at odds with the actions of
the state of Israel. Israel occupies Palestinian
land, and with violence on both sides, a peace-
ful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian con-.
flict appears distant.
My desire to process this aspect of my iden-
tity began the first time I met a Palestinian. I
attended a Jewish day school and was brought
up well inside the comforts of a Jewish estab-
lishment. I was taught to always defend Israel
against its enemies and that all criticism of
Israelwasveiled anti-Semitism.Atage 17, Iwas
introduced to a Palestinian. I was prepared to
argue with him, refute all of his points about
Israel and explain to him that Israel was only
acting to protect itself in all situations.
What I wasn't prepared for, however, was
his story. After hearing it, I could no longer
view Israel as perfect and Palestinians as evil
- Isaw both sides fight for the same rights and
values. More importantly, I realized that being
pro-Israel or pro-Palestine views were not

mutually exclusive, but interdependent. I was
met with hostility, however, when I expressed
my views within my community, to the point
that I felt uncomfortable discussing the con-
flict at all.
To me, at its root, the conflict reflects the
struggle for Israel to embody both a Jewish
and democratic character. The choice seems
to lead either to an Israel that pursues Jew-
ish tribalism and occupation, or an Israel that
pursues democratic ideals. When I was in Bal-
timore, only one session dealt with this ten-
sion. One speaker in particular discussed this
tension in a way that appealed to me. Rabbi
Professor Naftali Rothenberg, a deeply devout,
Orthodox Jew, spoke about his.love for Israel
and Judaism. When asked what he would do
if his views on Judaism and.democracy con-
flicted with each other, he gave the answer I
needed to hear. "It is no question, I would give
up a Judaism with no democracy in it. Judaism
without democracy is not a Judaism for me."
I feared questioning and struggling with
my identity would be isolating as I arrived
on campus at the University, but at Festifall,
I found J Street UMich. As the only student
organization on campus actively campaigning
for a comprehensive two-state solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we're working to
hold our democratic values and Jewish iden-
tity together. As the Jews involved in J Street
UMich, we have decided that a concern for the
future of both Israelis and Palestinians rests at
the very center of our work of Tikkun Olam.
This week, while pro-Israel and pro-
Palestine students rallied on the Diag, we
hand-delivered nearly 300 postcards signed
by students calling for American leadership
in the region to help create a two-state solu-
tion. While divisive actions run rampant on
our campus, we seek to be proactive in ensur-
ing safety and security for both Israelis and
Palestinians.
Unfortunately, interesting and nuanced
discussion about our identity as it relates to
today's state of Israel were absent at the assem-
bly. It was unacceptable that only one session
out of dozens dealt with the actual issues fac-
ing Judaism today. Luckily, these discussions
aren't missing on campus - you just need to
know where to find them.
Joel Elster is an LSA junior.

The University prides itself on
having a large out-of-state student
population of 42.6 percent of the
student body. University President
Mary Sue Coleman has expressed
interest in trying to attract even
more out-of-state students to
Ann Arbor. However, the Univer-
sity makes itself unattractive to
these students by not only giving
an incredibly short Thanksgiving
vacation break, but by scheduling
tests the first three days after stu-
dents return to campus.
Breaks should be a time for stu-
dents to recharge, and for many
out-of-state students Thanksgiving
break is the first time they will see
their families in four months. Sched-
uling a test on the Monday, Tuesday
or Wednesday after Thanksgiving
ensures that most students, local or
out-of-state, will spend most of their
break with textbooks and practice
tests instead of their families.
University professors should be
conscientious when they are sched-
uling tests, so hardworking students
can enjoy the few breaks they have.
The University has already
come under criticism for begin-
ning Thanksgiving break at 5 p.m.
the day before Thanksgiving. The
largest proportion of out-of-state
students come from New York or
California, 13.7 percent and 14.1
percent respectively. For these out-
of-state students, the average flight
is between three and six hours long,
decreasing the amount of time spent
with one's family down to 92 hours,
or 3.8 days.
Most students have come to
accept this part of life as a Univer-
sity student, however the organic
chemistry test and physics test

scheduled for the Tuesday and
Thursday cement the fact that these
students will spend their Thanks-
giving stressing over exams. They
will feel guilty when they spend
time with their families instead
of studying. Time not spent at the
Thanksgiving table will be spent
working at their desks.
There are many other tests sched-
uled for the week after Thanks-
giving but physics and organic
chemistry have the distinction as
some of the hardest introductory
courses offered. The averages on an
organic chemistry test usually fall
in the high 50s or low 60s as stated
in the course syllabus. Physics has
similar averages. Organic chemis-
try doesn't even give answers to the
practice tests, in the hope that stu-
dents will work together and learn
as a group.
Organic chemistry professor
Brian Coppola states in his sylla-
bus that the best way to learn is "to
be able to explain your ideas while
you are answering exam questions.
Study together productively. Set up
a group through the Science Learn-
ing Center or just do it on your own.
Our campus is filled with empty
classrooms - take turns going to
the board and teaching each other."
He's right, this is the best way to
learn. However, a campus that is full
of empty classrooms is useless when
students aren't on campus to utilize
them.
Finally, Thanksgiving is not fall
break. It's not supposed to be a time
before midterms for students to
spend hours on end in the library.
This is a national holiday celebrat-
ing a part of our country's history.
It's mandated by the United States

that this day be a vacation for public
schools and government workers.
This public university is funded, at
least in part, by government money.
While the school is following the
government's policy in the literal
sense, it is not doing its justice to
follow the spirit of the holiday. On
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day the
University sponsors gatherings
and speeches like Shirley Sherrod's
speech in 2011. These events keep
the meaning of MLK Day alive, but
the University has not done the
same for Thanksgiving, a holiday
that has become synonymous with
family time.
The University wants to increase
the number of out-of-state students,
yet they do very little to make the
University appealing for such stu-
dents - such as insanely expensive
out-of-state tuition rates, limited
vacation time and the inability to
enjoy vacations without the looming
threat of tests. Professors at a large
university already have to combat
the stereotype that they care more
about their research than their stu-
dents, and by scheduling tests at
unattractive times they are rein-
forcing this idea.
Students at the University are
hardworking and care about their
grades, and the fact that they
should have to choose between
their scholarship and their family
time is shameful. Thanksgiving is
a national holiday and professors
are acting in a disrespectful man-
ner by expecting students to forgo
their holiday traditions to either
stay on campus engross themselves
in silent study.

Rihanna's latest is catchy
and 'Unapologetic'
Ballads balance
excellently with

By GREGORY HICKS

And so begins the dispute over
Rihanna's non-stop stream of
album releases. If only Rihanna

willing to from
Talk That Talk. Unapologetic
But why slow Def Jam
down? Rihanna
doesn't need
an extra year to ponder what
music she'll be writing for her
next record, and every reputa-
ble songwriter and producer is
dying to have their work heard
on the Barbadian pop star's
album. The life of an artist is too
short to release new work every
three years, only to discover it's
a flop.
Unapologetic is no such thing,
however, and the worldwide
sensation of its lead single "Dia-
monds" bodes well for the suc-
cess of Rihanna's seventh studio
album. This ballad track might
be an atypical style for Rihanna,
but Stargate is most certainly not
an atypical production team -
the team is responsible for many
of the Barbadian's 11 number-
one hits.
"Diamonds" sets out to prove
that basic dance tracks aren't
the only way for a pop artist to
leap into the Top 10 in nearly
every country in the world. With
the release of the official remix
featuring Kanye West, Rihanna
channels Katy Perry's numerous
attempts to bump a single into

the number-one spot.
Elements identical to Usher's
smooth, R&B sound make their
way into "Numb," "Pour It Up"
and "Loveeeeeee Song," all of
which are conveniently grouped
together on the tracklist. This
slow-paced, club-suited style is
the lure that brings in Rihanna's
fanbase, who are always waiting
to hear the latest sound experi-
mentation from the artist.
"Numb" is particularly cap-
tivating, with its seductive R&B
essence mixed with hints of a
Middle Eastern style. Eminem
also flaunts the contrast from
their "Love the Way You Lie"
collaboration by bringing 'more
Slim Shady to the track.
"Jump" brings an end to the
pure R&B section of the record
and introduces a dubstep style.

over of samples from Ginuwine's
"Pony" might be too intense,
even for the listeners who seek
Rihanna's musical ferocity.
More pop-friendly dubstep
finds its way into "Right Now"
- brought to life by none other
than David Guetta himself. Evi-
dently, Rihanna's attention span
for Calvin Harris has worn off.
Melodically and lyrically, the
track is dull, but the hammering
kick and dirty synths are sure to
draw in the "Where Have You
Been" crowd.
If there's one attribute of
the album Rihanna were to be
Unapologetic about, it would be
her collaboration with Chris
Brown. It might be "Nobody's
Business," but it's guaranteed
to reel in the attention of any-
one who glances at the tracklist.
This '90s-esque dance tune is

the catchiest song on the record,
despite poor mixing decisions,
such as Brown's inaudible intro
vocals and tacky, high-pitched
inserts of "I wanna be your
baby." The track samples lyrics
from Michael Jackson's "The
Way You Make Me Feel," but
Brown is trying much too hard
to achieve the classically jagged
tone of Jackson's voice.
With the initial release of
"Diamonds" and the contin-
ued expression from tracks like
"Stay," "Love Without Tragedy"
and "Get It Over With," listen-
ers will hear the impassioned
side of the pop star's music in a
way that has remained dormant
since Rihanna's Rated R days.
Don't fear this bit of familiarity,
though. The Rihanna Navy will
still get its fair share of dynamic
styling that it's come to expect.

MUSIC NOT E Oh
And now introducing the holy
triumvirate of new school R&B

By JOHN LYNCH
Daily Arts Writer
In 14th-century Rome, the
Renaissance movement revo-
lutionized European art and
thought. In 1920s New York, the
Harlem Renaissance produced
an innovative group of poets and
writers who changed the liter-
ary world and U.S. culture. In
the Internet age of 2012, there is
another Renaissance quietly tak-
ing place in R&B music.
In the past decade or so, main-
stream R&B has become bogged
down with formulaic pop tunes.
As the Billboard charts evolved
to become more club friendly in
the 2000s, R&B followed suit
and began producing countless
synth-driven songs with trite,
predictable lyrics.
While Usher, Chris Brown
and many other acts have con-
sistently found commercial suc-
cess with this type of music, they
hardly bring anything new to
the table. Even soul singers like
Anthony Hamilton and R. Kelly
have continually put out unin-
spired albums that sound like
retreads of their previous work.
R&B was in need of a savior -
someone who could rescue the
genre from drowning in unorigi-
nality by being a creative force
and producing fresh music - and
luckily, it found three.
Around 2011, three artists
- The Weeknd, Frank Ocean
and Miguel (or as I like to call
them, The Holy Triumvirate of
New School R&B) - came out
of nowhere and began indepen-
dently releasing compelling and
original music. Just as Leonardo
da Vinci and Michelangelo har-
kened back to the works of clas-
sical scholars, Frank, Miguel
and The Weeknd took inspira-
tion from R&B's greats - includ-
ing Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder
and Prince - and created ambi-
tious and inventive records to
reinvigorate the stagnant genre.

cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
teaspoon kosher salt
1/ cup ( stick) butter
1/3 cup heavy cream.
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla
extract
Pecan Crumb Topping
Ingredients:
cup light brown sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped pecans
2 tablespoons (1/ stick) but-
ter, softened'
Directions:
Similar to how we boiled our
Yukon Gold potatoes yesterday,
peel the sweet potatoes and
chop them into rough, 2-inch
cubes. Again, it's optimal if you
can force someone else to do
this for you. Cover with cold
water in a large pot to ensure
even cooking. Bring the water
to a boil, reduce the heat to a
simmer and cook for approxi-
mately 30 minutes. When
effortlessly poked through with
a fork, the sweet potatoes are
finished cooking.
Drain the water and transfer
the sweet potatoes to a small
mixingbowl. Give them a quick
mash and slowly add the heavy
cream while mixing with an
electric mixer. Whip into a lush,
silky consistency. We're talking
like baby food puree, people: .
Blend those potatoes!
Then, also using an electric
mixer, whip together the but-
ter and sugar in a separate bowl
until light and fluffy. While
continuing to stir on low speed,
incorporate the eggs one a time,
mixing for one minute after each
addition. Stir in the salt and
vanilla just until combined.
Now, let's say we were to
throw caution to the wind and
simply dump the egg mixture
into the hot sweet pota-

Dressing Ingredients:
1 loaf whole grain bread
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
4 Vidalia onions .
1 package celery
2 tablespoons fresh sage
2 tahlespoons fresh thyme
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground
black pepper
1 cup homemade turkeybroth
2 cups chopped chestnuts
Directions:
Begin by dicing the whole
grain bread into -inch cubes.
Set aside.
Melt the butter in the bottom
of a Dutch oven set over medium
heat. Roughly chop and add the
celery and onions. Saut, stir-
ring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
Then, add the seasonings and
turkeybroth - the final cup of
four that we made last week in
my first column of this Thanks-
giving series. Cook for another
five minutes to reduce.
Remove the mixture from the
heat and fold in the chestnuts,
and cubes of bread. Transfer to
a buttered 9-by-13-inch baking
dish and bake at 350 degrees for
40 minutes, or until the top is
golden brown and the edges are
crisped.
I can't brag enough about the
flavor and texture complexities
imparted by the fresh herbs,
savory homemade turkeybroth,
earthy chestnuts, crunchy whole
grain bread and sweet onions.
Pairing perfectly with yester-
day's recipe for gravy, this dress-
ing has rightfully earned its
annual place of prominence on
my Thanksgiving plate. Bake up
a batch and you may find your-
self making room for it on yours,
as well.
Wood will round
it all out in the next
installment.

Weeknd created an entirely new

atmospheric synths and hard-

What separates this trio from
the rest of the R&B crowd is these
artists are true auteurs of their
craft. Much' like Wonder and
Gaye, who had complete creative
control in their later Motown
days, Ocean, Miguel and Tesfaye
all produce and write their own
music. The albums these three
have released in the past two
years are relatively free of label
influence which can often cor-
rupt the quality of R&B records.
With an unhindered ability to
take chances in their music,
Ocean, Miguel and The Weeknd
have produced and will con-
tinue to produce masterful R&B
music.

Lamenting the loss of a
physical collection

Despite the fact that I
largely grew up in the
Computer Age, I'm still
mourning for one casualty of
the transition to digital.
No, hip-
sters, I'm not

records. I

out of what are otherwise a
few circular grooves etched
in vinyl. But by the time I was
brought into the world, CDs
were the medium of choice - for
me, records were already long
antique, like any other obsolete
technology - I've never gotten
nostalgic about floppy disks.
Ironically, the tragedy in the
absence of physical music isn't
the lack of physical copies, so
much as the lack of physical
collections. I admit that mobile
libraries are vastly superior;
there's no question - I just have
a soft spot for the once-treasured
"record collection."
When I was little, there was
no greater joy than to watch a
visitor admire my father's siz-
able collection of CDs. Being a
music critic himself back in the
day (obligatory "like father, like
son"), he had amassed a hoard
of discs. Through careful collec-
tion, he was able to show off an
extensive glass case packed with
plastic and vinyl.
The selection did more than
impress. It was truly the only
way anyone could understand
my father's musical opinion - a
stranger could'watch him listen
to Christina Aguilera, then Foo
Fighters and then Kansas, and
conclude he had no discernable
taste. But I would eventually
understand that the case was a
timeline, a testament to his avid
passion for music.

later claim that his account was
"hacked." When Lupe Fiasco
responded to the taunting tweet
by claiming that Keef "scares
him," Keef shot back at his fellow
Chicagoan by writing that he will
"smack him" when (if) they ever
meet in person. Keef even had
his Instagram account deleted
after posting a picture of himself
receiving "sexual favors" from an
anonymous woman (you can fig-
ure it out), with an uploader com-
ment of "#GettinTip."
Understandably, Keef and his
GBE crew have received a tre-
mendous amount of criticism.
Aside from the usual trollingYou-
Tube comments of "Chief Keef is
killing Hip Hop!," "Hip Hop is
officially dead" and "Listen to
2Pac if you want real rap!," Keef
has garnered displeased respons-
es from innumerable "profession-
als." The Chicago Sun-Times put
a dread-veiled, smirking Keef on
their cover, asking in typical yel-
low-journalism bold whether the
rapper should be sent to jail.
The "regulators" of hip-hop,
megasite WorldStarHipHop,
constantly dot GBE's reaction-
ary videos with dramatic catch-
phrase titles ("This Is F***** Up:
Lil Reese From GBE Caught On
Camera Beating Up A Female!"),
all the while understanding that
their own success is derived
purely from the degradation they
so criticize. Lupe Fiasco even
claimed that the current per-
petrators of Chicago's endemic
crimes "all look like Chief Keef,"
and that he fearsothe "culture that
he represents."
Sure, certain musicians have
"risen out" of the ever-present
disarray in theirhometowns. But
in 1996, the only glimpses the
world had of rappers like Jay-Z
were directed shots of brand
new Lexuses. In contemporary
American culture, the musician
who once may have appeared
"flawless" (though they rarely
did) is now barraged with Inter-
net-born criticisms. We all put
our lives out for the world to see,
and the true elements of many
individuals can now be fully
perceived through the distorted
lens of saturated Instagram pho-
tos. The raw truths of men like
Lil Reese are now evident to all,
whereas the truths of past rap-
per's societies were oft hidden
- save the content in their oft-
unreliable lyrics.
While the actions of Keef and
his crew are indefensible, to criti-
cize GBE for the "degradation" of
society or hip hop is absurd. Hip-
hop culture has always been ris-
que - it has always documented
the elements of American life that
many choose to ignore. Greats
like The Notorious B.I.G. made
entire songs about dealing drugs
and killing: "Ten Crack Com-
mandments" is literally a list of
instructions on how to deal crack.
Yes, rappers such as Biggie and
21tac were certainly criticized in
their time, but to glimpse them in
an entirely positive retrospect is
not only incorrect, it's ignorant.
These are the men who helped to
craft modern hip hop, doing the
same things Keef and his GBE
crew are constantly lambasted
for. To claim that videos like the
Lil Reese attack are killing hip
hop is entirely contradictory to

the concept and background of
hip hop in itself.
These things have always hap-
pened, do happen and will hap-
pen. Hip hop's purpose is only to
document the events, often dis-
playing them through raw poetry
over electronic drums. Now, we
just see the events through the
distorted lenses of iPhones. The
world of rap hasn't gotten any
better or worse - our perspective
has just changed.

14 Defense has record-setting
performance vs. Seton Hall

Senior guard Kate Thompson scored a game-high 19 points in Michigan's victory over Seton Hall Monday.
'M' sails past the Pirates

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
After falling behind 11-0 in Fri'-
day's loss against Utah, the Michi-
gan women's basketball team (3-1)
was determined to get off to a
quicker start in its game against
Seton Hall
(2-2). For SETON HALL 29
the Wolver- MICHIGAN 72
ines, it was,
a 180-degree switch, as Michigan
jumped out to a 9-0 lead to start
the game and never looked back,
as they coasted to a 72-29 victory.
For Michigan head coach Kim
Barnes Arico, seeing a former
Big East foe signaled a cakewalk,
as she defeated Seton Hall in her
ninth consecutive game against
them.
"I kind of knowtheir coaches,
their players and everything that
they do," Barnes Arico said. "I
think it's a little bit of an advan-
tage. It's always nice when you
know your opponents."
With a tenacious defense that
remained constant throughout
the game, the Wolverines held the
Pirates to six first-half points on
two field goals and one free throw,
and they led 35-6 at the half.
"We just had to let the past go.
We let Utah go," said senior guard
Jenny Ryan. "We focused on
Seton Hall and we really focused
on the first four minutes which we
let go in Utah and that was the dif-
ference."

The defense was visible early as
Ryan stole and blocked a shot on
Seton Hall's second and third pos-
session, leading to a fastbreak for
Michigan and an eventual layup
for Ryan.
Following a 3-pointer by senior
guard Kate Thompson and anoth-
er layup by Ryan, Seton Hall was
forced to call its first timeout at
the 15:33 mark, in an attempt to
stop the dismantling at the hands
of the Wolverines.
The struggles continued for the
Pirates, as they failed to register
their first points until 7:19 into
the game, on a 3-point basket by
freshman forward Tabatha Rich-
ardson-Smith.
The Michigan onslaught didn't
stop, as the Wolverines went on
a 26-3 run to close the first half
while causing Seton Hall to shoot
7.7 percent from the field.
Meanwhile, Thompson
dropped a career-high and game-
high 19 points, including five
3-pointers. Sheffer contributed 16
points and eight rebounds, while
Ryan also broke the 10-point pla-
teau with11.
In addition to causing the
Pirates to shoot so poorly in the
first half, the Wolverines out-
rebounded them 21-14 - including
18-9 on the defensive end. In total,
they out-rebounded Seton Hail
43-33, with 35 of the boards com-
ing off the defensive glass.
Perhaps the most noteworthy
fact about Michigan's complete

domination was Seton Hall's 12:19
drought between scoring points
in the first half The 29 points by
Seton Hall marked Michigan's
program-low for points allowed
in a game.
The story wasn't any different
in the second half as the Wolver-
ines outscored the Pirates 12-3 to
start the stanza.
Seton Hall finally reached
double digits with 12:11 left in
the game with two free throws
but never got within 30 points of
Michigan.
Despite being pressed con-
sistently throughout the second
half, the Wolverines kept finding
ways to get the ball downcourt
and made it look easy compared
to their opponents.
Turnovers were the only blem-
ish for Michigan. Though they the
blew the Pirates out of the water,
the Wolverines still committed 24
turnovers, matching Seton Hall.
"I think for a lot of it, we're
going to have to handle the pres-
sure better," said senior forward
Rachel Sheffer. "I think that's just
a glimpse of what the Big Ten is
going do to us, so we just have.to
work on handling pressure bet-
ter."

bench with 2:47 left as sophomore

DailySports Writer
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team has struggled with
defense thus far this season. But
that all changed Monday night
against Seton Hall.
In a game that was never
close, the Wolverines won,
72-29, at Crisler Center as the
defense stole the show.
"I thought we did a heck of
a job on defense against them,"
said Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico. "An absolute heck
of a job."
Similar to its loss against
Utah on Friday, Michigan (3-1)
struggled to get its offense going
early, but this time, the defense
compensated.
"The keys for us were to come
out strong on our home floor and
score quickly," said Michigan
senior forward Kate Thompson.
"We also wanted them to push
them on defense and we did a
really good job of that."
The Pirates did not score until
7:19 into the first half, and by
then they had already commit-
ted eight turnovers. Seton Hall
(2-2) finally scored on a 3-point-
er from freshman forward
Tabatha Richardson-Smith, and
that would be the Pirates' only
field goal until senior guard
Brittany Morris connected on
a short jumper with 22 seconds
remaining in the first half.
"I think Seton Hall really
struggles shooting the ball, but
they do a great job of rebound-
ing the basketball after their
misses," Barnes Arico said. "I
thought we did agood job of lim-
iting them to one shot, which is
a really good sign for us. We're
typically not a great rebounding
team."
After taking a comfortable
35-6 lead at halftime, the Wol-
verines went into the locker
room having outrebounded

Vaughan plugs in off the ice

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily SportsEditor
Scooter Vaughan had always
heard about the Michigan alum-
ni base, tight-knit despite its
status as one of the world's larg-
est networks, but it wasn't until
this fall that he was able to see it
mobilized.
That's when Vaughan, a 2011
University graduate and for-
mer forward on the hockey
team, launched a fundraising
campaign for the product he is
marketing along with longtime
friend Austin Glenn.
Lastspring, Glenn approached
Vaughan, forever the music
lover, about an idea he had for
a new option in the headphone
market. Unimpressed with the
designs currently available to
shoppers, the pair set out to
design something convenient
and fashionable, and they cre-
ated the prototype for Jamboo
Headphones.
"They all look the same,"
Vaughan said of the current
options. "It's either a white cord
or a black cord."
Jamboo, on the other hand,
is crafted, as its name would
suggest, out of bamboo wood.
According to Vaughan, one of
the headphones' defining fea-
tures is that they are woven to be
tangle-free, alleviating one of the
most common complaints among
headphone wearers. The head-
phones are also woven with one
of six different brightly colored
styles.
"People love them," Vaughan
said. "They sound great. There
are three different-sized ear-
plugs. They last, too. They don't
fray or come apart. I've had my
pair for six or seven months now.
I use it every day."
This summer, Vaughan shared
the prototypes with friends like
current Michigan defenseman
Mac Bennett.

ferent levels of financing, all of
which come with a different
reward as a thank you - from a

Besides the prototypes, no
headphones have been produced

Vaughan said. "I realized that

filled in for Morgan against the
Hawkeyes. Ross led the team
with 12 tackles, nine of which
were solo.
"I thought James, I think
from day one, we thought he was
instinctive and a good football
player," Hoke said. "It doesn't
surprise you that he has good
instincts. He sees things well
and he likes to tackle."
Even though Morgan should
be full go for Saturday, Ross's
solid performance against Iowa
provided reassurance that
Michigan's linebacking corps
has good depth should, some-
body go down again.

Beilein: Maryland is a good fit for the Big Ten

They aren't among the great-
est to play in the Big Ten, but as of
Monday, they're now among the
greatest to play at one of the con-
ference's member schools.
The University of Maryland
Board of Regents voted to join the
Big Ten, leavingthe ACC, in which
Maryland was a charter member.
The move inflates the Big Ten to 13
schools, and the expected addition
of Rutgers on Tuesday will bring it
to an even 14.
Maryland's first season of Big-
Ten competition will come in the
2014-15 academic year.
"Between the Big Ten Network
and the strength of our confer-
ence right now, (the Big Ten has)
been very good to men's basketball
since I've been here," said Michi-
gan coach John Beilein Monday.
"If they believe Maryland is the
right fit, I'm all for it."
The Terrapins have a rich bas-
ketball tradition, and College
Park, Md. became an NBA breed-
ing ground under legendary coach
LeftyDriesell, and later, Gary Wil-
liams, who brought the program
its first national championship in
2002. He also brought the Terra-
pins to their only other Final Four

appearance in 2001.
Michigan has split six match-
ups with Maryland and won the
schools' only NCAA Tournament
matchup - a 78-71 triumph in the
regional semifinals in 1994.
With 14 teams, the confer-
ence must determine whether to
increase the number of Big Ten
games during the season, or keep,
the schedule at 18 games, with
each school playing more teams,
but losing a home-and-home two-
game series with a few teams each
year. The alternative under an
expanded schedule would be to

retain the home-and-home for-
mat, but play fewer teams each
season.
"I know the coaches generally
like fewer games, I know the com-
missioners generally like more
games and I think there's probably
a compromise in the middle," said
Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany
in a teleconference on Monday.
The difficulty of scheduling
with more teams may make the
creation of basketball divisions
necessary. The football divisions
appear to be a solution, but the
strengths of schools in basketball

could make the split unequal.
"In the Big East, we did not
have divisions," Beilein said of his
time at West Virginia. "We just
played and they found a way to
do it and it wasn't always a math-
ematical plan that had equity. It
was just what makes sense for TV,
and frankly, that happens a lot."
Opening the East Coast to the
Big Ten adds big markets and sig-
nificant money to the conference,
but it could also compound logisti-
cal issues.

announcement,
but it was a frequently addressed
topic, and one that the sixth-year
Michigan coach is pleased with.
"We talked expansion often
before," Beilein said. "Maryland
was one name that people had
heardtalked about, notfrom Dave,
from people that talked about dif-
ferent options and especially the
East-Coast market. We've got-
ten more into the Midwest, to go
to the East Coast is a pretty good
idea."
