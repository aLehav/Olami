meeting took place

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
The University's Board of
Regents held an informal meeting
early yesterday morning to receive
an update on the NCAA's investi-
gation into the Michigan football
program, a source familiar with
the situation told The Michigan
Daily.
The meeting convened at 8 a.m.
yesterday morning in the confer-
ence room
in Univer- First reported on
sity Presi- Midhigdti)ailyconl
dent Maryx
Sue Coleman's office and lasted 90
minutes, the source said.
The NCAA investigation, which
has been officially underway since
October, is focused on allegations
that Michigan's football team vio-

lated NCAA regulations on the
number of hours student-athletes
are allowed to spend practicing
and in off-season workouts.
As he left the meeting, Regent
Andrew Richner (R-Grosse Pointe
Park) told the Detroit Free Press
to direct all questions to the Uni-
versity's general counsel, Suellyn
Scarnecchia.
Calls to other regents yesterday
went unreturned or were met with
no comment. A spokesman for
Coleman told the Daily that Cole-
man would not comment on the
meeting or the investigation.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald confirmed that the
meeting had taken place, saying
notice of the regents meeting was
posted at the Fleming Administra-
tion Building yesterday. However,
Fitzgerald said because it was an
"informal meeting" and not a "spe-
cial meeting" the topic of the meet-
ing was not posted.
An informal meeting would
mean that the regents were sim-
ply briefed about something with
possible discussion, but that no

In State of the State,
gov. announces
scholarship will be
in budget proposal
By TORREY ARMSTRONG
Daily StaffReporter
LANSING - In her eighth and
final State of the State address last

night, Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm announced her bud-
get for the 2011 fiscal year would
restore the Promise Scholarship
and guard against further cuts to
education.
However, Granholm did not
reveal specific plans for funding
the scholarship's restoration.
The scholarship was elimi-
nated last November, when Gra-
nholm signed the final bills of the
2010 state budget. Granholm's

2011 budget plan will be officially
released next week when she sub-
mits it to the legislature for con-
sideration.
"The choices we face in thebud-
get are tough, but is there a single
family in Michigan that would
choose to make ends meet in hard
times by first sacrificing the needs
of the children?" she said.
The restoration of the Promise
Scholarship is especially signifi-
cant in light of rising tuition rates

in the state and the possibility of
decreasing state appropriations
for higher education. In her State
of the State last year, Granholm
called for a tuition freeze at all
public universities in the state.
But as the University experi-
enced further financial strain, the
regents voted 6-2 to raise tuition
by 5.6 percent last June.
Since then, budget shortages
have fueled speculation and even

Rodriguez even admitted that

Michigan's final signee, Florida
defensive back recruit Demar
Dorsey, could be the jewel of
Rodriguez's recruiting class. The
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. native is
ranked as the No. 2 safety and No.
12 overall player in the country by
ESPN.
As a four-star defensiveback on
Rivals.com and Scout.com, Dors-
ey's talent isn't being called into
question. But past legal troubles

his press conference announcing

A Demar Dorsey listed on the

Florida, who's birthday matches

cited on two felony charges: bur-

in 2007 and robbery with a dead-
ly weapon in 2008. Dorsey was
never convicted of either crime,
and both summaries list the cases
as closed.
Though Dorsey was never con-
victed, the announcement that he
was signed highlighted previous
concerns about Rodriguez's vet-

Student group with
ties to MSA needs
1,000 signatures to
get plan on ballot
BY ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily Staff Reporter
A campus group with ties to
the Michigan Student Assembly
is looking to make big changes to
the MSA Student Compiled Code.
The process - which includes

redrafting the entire document
and seeking support for the final
version - began this month.
Last fall, MSA representatives
wanted to revise the code through
a constitutional convention, but
Rackham representative Kate
Stenvig raised concerns about the
revision, calling the action uncon-
stitutional. Because the document
could not be restructured inter-
nally, LSA senior and MSA vice
president Michael Rorro started
Students for Progressive Gover-
nance as a grassroots organiza-
tion to develop a draft.

The group is currently mak-
ing its second attempt to revamp
the document - 26 years after
the last full-scale revision. Rorro,
chair of S4PG, said the group will
have the final document ready by
Monday.
The proposed constitution calls
for a restructured assembly con-
sisting of a new legislative branch
along with the central executive
branch already in place.

tral executive branch will

In front of a group of about 50
students, faculty and staff, Laura
Perna, an associate professor at
the University of Pennsylvania,
gave a talk yesterday on the chal-

in which public policies and social
norms affect higher education
opportunities for women, minor-
ity groups and individuals of low
socioeconomic status.
Highlighting Michigan's need
to increase educational perfor-
mance in areas like Detroit, Perna
said universities play an important
role in improvement efforts and
promoting higher education.

Crting a study fram the George-
town University Center on Educa-
tion and the Workforce, Perna said
an estimated 30 million jobs will
require secondary education by
2018.
"Unless we increase our current
levels of production, the demand
for college educated workers will
exceed the supply," Perna said.

While there are many groups on
campus that focus on shared inter-
ests, one student group centers
around bringing together those
with different backgrounds.
A campus organization com-
mitted to social action and cultural
awareness, MuJew is a student
group that seeks to build inter-per-
sonal bridges between Muslim and
Jewish students at the University.
LSA sophomores Molly Mar-
dit and Jenna Weinberg and LSA
senior Husnah Khan founded
MuJew in October of last year, in
an effort to bring Muslim and Jew-
ish students together in a relaxed
atmosphere that fostered mutual
understanding and constructive
dialogue.
Mardit said the organization
was born out of the University's
MuJew Alternative Spring Break
trip, which she said was the only
official event in which Muslim and

MuJew
Jewish students formally worked
together.
Mardit said the group aims to
"(continue) the conversation on
some of the things that Muslims
and Jews share in common."
Weinberg said MuJew is com-
posed of three pillars: social action,
volunteer work, and cultural
awareness.
MuJew also "doesn't take a
stance" on the Arab-Israeli con-
flict, Weinberg said, though the
group seeks to create a safe space
for members to talk about the issue
if they want.
"(We) shy away from the con-
flict," Weinberg said.
She said the group is instead
about "building strong ties
between our religions. The conflict
isn't specific to th'e group. It isn't
specifically about Palestinians or
Jews. Not all Jews are Israelis and
not all Muslims are Palestinians."

NEWS BRIEFS
. NEWYORK
Service sector
gauge shows growth
in January
The economy's service sector
grew in January for the first time
since September while the pace
of job losses moderated, a private
trade group said yesterday.
The Institute for Supply Man-
agement said its service sector
index rose to 50.5 last month from
a revised 49.8 in December. Econo-
mists polled by Thomson Reuters
had expected a reading of 51.
* Any reading above 50 signals
growth. That threshold was broken
in September for the first time in 13
months. The service sector's recov-
ery has been bumpy since, shrink-
ing in November and December.
ISM originally said December's
" measurement was 50.1, a growth
reading, but revised it lower to 49.8
in its yearly seasonal adjustment
late last month.
New orders, a signal of future
business activity, picked up in Jan-
uary, showing growth for the fifth
straight month. Business activity
also expanded in January, although
more slowly than in December.
TORRANCE, Calif.
Toyota: Vehicles
with no sticky
pedals are safe
0 Toyota says recalled vehicles
that have not experienced prob-
lems with their accelerator pedals
are safe to drive.
The automaker's comments
come after Transportation Sec-
retary Ray LaHood said that
* Toyota owners should stop driv-
ing recalled Toyota cars and
trucks. LaHood later told report-
ers he misspoke, saying drivers
of recalled vehicles should take
them to dealerships to have them
repaired.
Toyota, which has recalled 2.3
million vehicles in the U.S. due
to the potential for sticky accel-
erators, says the problem is rare.
The automaker is shipping a fix
to dealerships around the country
this week.
BOGOTA, Colombia
Rights group urges
! control of militias
New militias have arisen to
replace Colombia's notorious
right-wing paramilitary groups
and they are committing the
same sorts of violence as their
* predecessors, a prominent inter-
national rights organization said
yesterday.
More than 31,000 fighters have
been demobilized from the para-
military coalition known as the
United Self-Defense Forces of
Colombia, or AUC, in recent years,
but dozens of newly emerged suc-
cessor groups have engaged in
activities ranging from mass mur-
der to extortion, according to New
York-based Human Rights Watch.
The paramilitaries were orga-

nized by rural landowners seek-
ing protection from leftist rebels,
but they soon became a power-
ful, lawless drug-dealing force
in much of the country. The U.S.
government has declared the
AUC a terrorist organization.

Anti-Semitic acts

A group founded to protect

anti-Semitic acts in France soared
75 percent last year - many com-
ing as Israel pressed an offensive
against Hamas in the Middle East
in January.
The Jewish Community Pro-
tection Service tallied 832 anti-
Semitic acts in 2009, up from
474 a year earlier. Most involved
graffiti and threatening gestures;
about 17 percent involved vandal-
ism and violence.
The group said yesterday that
354 took place in January 2009
V alone, when Israel ended a three-
week offensive against Pales-
tinian militant group Hamas in
response to rocket attacks from
Gaza.
France is home to western

after EPA visit

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, left, listens to his Defense Minister Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, as he looks at engine of a
domestically-built satellite booster rocket capable of launching nuclear warheads.
Iranmullsp
nuclear compromise

Ahmadinejad says
he may export
uranium stockpile
VIENNA (AP) - Iran's effort
to revive talks on a deal that
would inhibit the country's abil-
ity to make a nuclear weapon
was met with skepticism by
world leaders yesterday, a reac-
tion to months of waffling by
Tehran.
Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's suggestion that
he would at last agree to export a
significant amount of uranium for
processing comes as the U.N. con-
siders a fourth round of sanctions.
against the country for failing to
rein in their nuclear program.
The timing raises suspicions that
Iran is just trying to buy time.
Iran now possesses more than
enough enriched uranium for at
least one nuclear warhead and
the U.N. Security Council has
demanded the Islamic Republic
freeze its enrichment program.
An agreement worked out by the
International Atomic Energy
Agency would delay Tehran's
ability to make such a weapon
by requiring the country to
export 70 percent of its urani-
um stock and then wait for up
to a year for it to be processed
and returned as fuel rods for a
research reactor.
Ahmadinejad stopped short
of accepting the agreement in
its entirety, offering a shorter
turnaround time for return of
the fuel rods. Iranian Foreign
Minister Manouchehr Mot-
taki described it as a "formula
which could build confidence."
Western reaction to the
plan was cautious, at best.
French Foreign Minister Ber-
nard Kouchner said he was
"perplexed," suggesting Iran
was stalling for time. Officials
from the U.S., Britain and
Germany were also skeptical.
The announcement came
amid other mixed signals
by Iran, which on Wednes-
day launched a menagerie -
including a mouse, two turtles
and worms - into space on a
research rocket.
The Iranian space program
has worried Western powers,
which fear the same technol-
ogy used to launch satellites
and research capsules could
also be used to build long-
range missiles and deliver
warheads. Ahmadinejad said
the launch showed Iran could
defeat the West in the battle of
technology.
"The launch was clearly
part of Iran's effort to advance
military technology and assert
political dominance in space,"
said James Lewis senior fel-
low at the Washington-based
Center for Strategic and Inter-
national Studies. "It's also
a show of confidence. Space
rockets give you prestige and
influence, and that is what
Iran seeks."
Questions were also raised
about Ahmadinejad's state-
ment Tuesday that the U.S.
and Tehran were discuss-
ing a swap of three American
hikers being held in Tehran
for Iranians in U.S. prisons.
U.S. Secretary of State Hill-
ary Rodham Clinton yester-

day denied there were any
such negotiations and ruled
out the suggested swap. Clin-
ton said that the hikers and
other Americans jailed in Iran
should be released immediate-
ly on humanitarian grounds
because there is no basis for

their continued detention.
On the nuclear front, it was
unclear what Ahmadinejad
was willing to concede when
it comes to the plan, which has
been endorsed by the U.S., Rus-
sia, China, Britain, France and
Germany.
For months, Iranian officials
have said they were not prepared
to export the bulk of their stock-
pile. The comments by Ahma-
dinejad - that Iran will have "no
problem" in shipping the uranium
out and taking it back in its new
form several months later - thus
were potentially significant.
His time frame of four or five
months, however, appeared to
fall short of the year that West-
ern officials say it would take for
Iran's enriched fuel to be turned
into fuel rods.
If that difference cannot be
bridged, it could allow Iranian
officials to assert that the deal
failed due to Western foot-drag-
ging, despite their readiness to
accept the basics of the proposed
formula.
Ahmadinejad also did not
address whether his country

was ready to ship out most of its
stockpile in one batch -- another
key condition.
Experts believe Tehran would
need at least a year to replen-
ish its stockpile at its present
rate of uranium enrichment.
Incremental exports of smaller
amounts - as previously pro-
posed by Iran - could allow it
to replenish its stock through its
own program, providing enough
material for a warhead.
Iran's past record of playing
for time during nuclear negotia-
tions also feeds skepticism.
World powers emerged from
nuclear talks in September, their
first with Iran in over a year,
ebullient about what they said
was Tehran's tentative accep-
tance of the fuel swap plan.
Tehran subsequently balked
and began offering unacceptable
alternatives.
It also kept the IAEA wait-
ing for an answer until a few
weeks ago, when diplomats told
The Associated Press that it
delivered a rejection of the pro-
posal to Director General Yukiya
Amano.

Six children within

hugged sonsbornwithcleftpalates.
The mothers believe six chil-
dren were born in the area with
defects during an 18-month peri-
od because they live three miles
downwind from the biggest haz-
ardous waste landfill west of the
Mississippi River.
"The medical people tell us we
have to have evidence before we
can say they are the ones who are
to blame," said Daria Hernandez,
whose 20-month-old son Ivan
has been through two surgeries
to repair a cleft palate and needs
more treatment.
Blumenfeld has promised to
determine what his agency has
done to analyze whether the prob-
lemis linked to the Chemical Waste
Management Inc. landfill, which
wants to expand. Bob Henry, man-
ager of the waste facility, maintains
the operation is safe and hopes the
government scrutiny will improve
lives of the community.
Kettleman City, population
1,500, is a crossroads on Interstate
5, California's main north-south
artery. Thousands of diesel trucks
pass by every day. The town also
is bisected by high-tension power
lines and surrounded by the farm
fields where many of the residents
work in fields sprayed with pesti-

cides and chemical fertilizers.
The mother want to know what is
to blame for the problems if not the
landfill full of PCBs and pesticides.
We are asking him to support
us because a lot of women are
scared," Hernandez said. "We
have so many questions."
Blumenfeld met privately with
families after a private tour of the
waste facility. The families said
afterward that Blumenfeld spoke
generally about the need for bet-
ter health monitoring. They called
it a victory.
"They made a promise that they
would investigate, and I hope they
keep the promise," said Magdalena
Romero, whose daughter who died
of Crone's disease would have been
2 on Tuesday.
Blumenfeld said little about
the meetings that his aides had
described earlier as a listening ses-
sion.
"It's an emotional thing to talk
about," he said after spending 80
minutes in the home of Maura
Alatorre, whose son, Emmannuel
was born 2 years ago with a cleft
palate. "I learned a lot, and, hope-
fully, they feel better being able to
share."
Afterward he issued a written
statement thanking the families
for sharingtheir stories.
"I am deeply moved by their
honesty and ability to speak so
candidly about their heartbreaking
experiences," Blumenfeld said.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
has promised that two state agen-
cies would look intothe health issue
after being hounded for nearly two
years by Greenaction, an environ-
mental justice group. The birth
defects became a rallying point last
year for residents trying to stop the
expansion plans ofthewaste facility.
Their stories of miscarriages
and the photographs they car-
ried of children with facial defects
failed to convince the Kings
County Board of Supervisors that
the company's expansion plans
should not go forward.

Counting on students
Students have a responsibilty to complete 2010 census
With the new decade upon us, it will soon be time for
students to take 10 minutes to participate in the U.S.
census. The census counts the number of people liv-
ing in the country and in each state and is used to determine the
amount of federal funding each state will receive. Results from
the 2000 census showed that students living in college towns
had a lower response rate than any other demographic. But since
census forms determine how much federal funding Ann Arbor
will be given, student response is vital. When students receive
their census forms in March, they should do the city a favor and
fill them out.

This plan - diversifying our economy,
educating our people, protecting them
along the way - this is the path forward.
- Gov. Jennifer Granholm, speaking in her final State of the State
address, as reported yesterday by the Detroit News.

As reported by the Daily on Monday, the
2000 census showed a low turnout rate
for college students. The national average
for responses hovered around 67 percent.
In contrast, one area of Ann Arbor - com-
prised mostly of student housing - had a
response rate of 38 percent. To combat this
trend among students, the University has
taken measures to encourage students to
participate in the upcoming 2010 census,
which will occur in March. The University
plans to launch a video campaign contest
in an effort to reach out to students. The
videos are meant to clear up any confusion
about where to register and increase stu-
dent participation. The best video submis-
sions will even receive a monetary prize.
It's good that the University is working
to increase student participation in the
census because every individual matters.
For every person who doesn't complete the
census, the community loses $1,200 in fed-
eral funding each year. Because students
didn't take the time to fill out the census in
2000, Ann Arbor has been missing out on
funding that it could have invested in proj-
ects like fixing Ann Arbor's dismal roads
and infrastructure. Students who don't
complete the forms are doing Ann Arbor a
disservice.
Some students' confusion regarding

census rules is understandable. Students
aren't permanent city residents and may
think they should be counted in their home
town. But the census should be filled out
where individuals are living the majority
of the year as of April 1. So for students
who attend the University eight months
out of the year, Ann Arbor is the place to
register. Even students who aren't U.S.
citizens must still fill out the census form.
And don't worry about obtaining a census
form - they are delivered to every resi-
dence in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
It would be helpful if the Census Bureau
made the survey available online. The
bureau's website claims that Internet
forms will be available in the future, but
won't be offered this cycle. On top of being
more user-friendly, the online forms would
be more environmentally-friendly. The
bureau should make online forms available
for the 2020 census.
For now, students will have to cope with
filling out the forms the old-fashioned way
in hardcopy and returning them via snail
mail. Filling out the census only takes
about 10 minutes - most people will only
have to answer 10 questions - so there's no
excuse for not doing it.
It's up to students to get Ann Arbor
proper funding. So get your pens ready.

The night before I left home for
my first year of college, Ihad
heart-to-heart with a lifelong
friend at our favor-
ite coffeeshop.
Within hours, we
would be embark-
ing on journeys to
separate schools,
putting 600 miles
between us. And
that night, in addi-
tion to saying
our farewells, we MATTHEW
mused on our anx-G
ieties about going GREEN
to college, fitting
in and meeting
people in our new environments.
She was leavingsoon for New York,
where she would be attending school
with only one girl whom she already
knew. And though she was sure she'd
quickly find friends, her story was
decidedly more unpredictable than
mine. I, in contrast, had made the
decision to join 40 or so other kids
from my high school en route to Ann
Arbor. That number included many
of my closest friends, in addition to
the majority of people from my high
school that I didn't detest. I was
optimistic and pleased about com-
ing to college with a sizeable cush-
ion of friends. But as I continue my
second year at the University, there
have been times when I've envied my
friend in New York for going solo, so
to speak, after high school.
On the one hand, it's rare and
delightful that I can hang out with
my childhood friends, even in this
pseudo-adult stage of my life. Some-
times just seeing them casually, even
in passing, brings warm memories to
my mind. And in the first weeks of
school, it was certainly comforting

to see a familiar face walking toward
me on the Diag.
But as time went on, a number of
questions arose regarding the new
social world I was constructing for
myself. I debated the extent to which
I should see my old friends, whom I
wouldn't otherwise see in classes or
my dorm. I wondered if I should try
to incorporate my high school friends
with those whom I had met in col-
lege. And I even considered whether
or not I ought to consciously sever
ties with certain friends for the sake
of "moving on."
I framed these questions on terms
of what I "should" or "ought to" be
doing, using these auxiliary verbs to
imply some sort of obligation. Indeed,
whether or not I was obligated to
maintain my old relationships has
ultimately been the key question of
my adjustment to college life. And I
suppose I'm still not sure I've figured
it out completely.
If my friends were at other schools
and I didn't see them every day, I
wouldn't feel bad about it. There would
be no superficial imperative to assert
my love and affection for them. But on
campus, if I didn't see my friends from
home on a regular basis, I often felt
guilty. Since we were in the same city,
I thought, I really had no excuse not to
see them. And I'd often get that feeling
thatIgetwhen Iwait longer than usual
to call my parents.
At our school in particular, per-
haps as at any large public university,
there are presumably many pockets of
friends who have continued on togeth-
er since high school or even earlier.
And this can surely be terrific. For all
of my angst over continued high school
relationships, I, too, am still very close
with a handful of childhood friends in
Ann Arbor. But I think people in this

position really need to consider their
social decisions wisely.
I get by with a
little help from
. my friends.
It's important to understand that
none of us are duty-bound to main-
tain our relationships from high
school. Old friends make terrific
confidants and will unequivocally
support you when you need it. But if
the relationship isn't fitting in with
the life you've created in college, it's
essential to recognize this and figure
out the perhaps less central role you'd
like them to play. Also realize that no
longer seeing your old friends fre-
quently does not equate with no lon-
ger loving them. It just means you're
organically evolving with the ebb and
flow of college and not adhering-to
the confines of adolescence.
I'm still a little jealous of my friend
in New York. Not only did she create
many new friendships, but she could
also reinvent herself completely. Had
she wanted, she could've shaved her
hair or renamed herself Coco with-
out anyone from high school rolling
his or her eyes. But since I've gotten
past the awkward questions - and
gotten rid of the "shoulds" I had been
hearing - I've been able to restore
balance to my social life. And I know
I'm much happier, too, with a perfect
blend of old and new in college.

LAURA VEITH I
Ann Arbor and 'U'

Most students have only four years to expe-
rience the University and the Ann Arbor com-
munity. And although academics are extremely
important, students - including myself - need
to take a step out of the library and seize all of
the opportunities and attractions offered in
Ann Arbor. This town provides so many cul-
tural, artistic, and dining resources that many
students fail to take full advantage of. But in
return for student patronage, the city of Ann
Arbor needs to put more of an effort into cam-
pus promotion of featured city events.
It is extremely difficult for students to expe-
rience attractions and events if there are limited
or even no advisements displayed to students on
campus. Though students need to start seizing
upon the countless opportunities offered by Ann
Arbor, the city must work at promoting events
more within the campus community.
Take, for instance, Ann Arbor Restaurant
Week, an event that included discounted lunch
and dinner meals at 28 participating local res-
taurants. The event was held Jan. 17 through
Jan. 22. One would think a significant event
like this would be featured in countless adver-
tisements in campus buildings and on the
streets enclosing the University area.
Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The first
time I heard about the event was ina Daily arti-
cle that ran on Jan. 25, after it was already over
(Second Ann Arbor Restaurant Week stimulates
local economy, 01/25/10). The event came and
went before I had the opportunity to make it
down to Main St. With discounted specials at
reasonable prices, many students would have
loved to take advantage of the offer. But by
failing to properly advertise around campus,
restaurants downtown lost the business of
potential student customers. It's a shame that
students and the participating restaurants
couldn't both benefit.
Similarly, the Michigan Theater failed to suf-
ficiently promote on campus the recent view-
ing of a Sundance film. The program, entitled

Sundance USA, allowed select theaters around
the country to view a film typically only avail-
able during the Sundance Film Festival. Though
the Michigan Theater did do a fair share of
advertisement around and within the city, the
advertisements were not prominently displayed
throughout campus. For instance, the theater
rented a billboard on I-94. But I am one of the
unlucky students who doesn't have a car and thus
am nottravelingdown the highway too frequent-
ly. This failure in advertising within University
buildings and along campus streets limited stu-
dent involvement in the event.
The disconnect between the University com-
munity and the city businesses needs to change.
Students could provide local businesses with
a significant amount of patronage if they were
informed of special events that would appeal
to them, like Restaurant Week and the Sun-
dance film at the Michigan Theater. There are
40,000 students on campus that local busi-
nesses haven't been targeting - but they should
be. Students are a large population that the city
hasn't been focusing on that could potentially
spend a lot of money at local businesses. Though
Ann Arbor hasn't been as severly affected by the
recession, it could still benefit from increased
student patronage.
And students would benefit from increased
attendance to local events, too. I came to the
University for more than just its academic and
athletics - I came for the city of Ann Arbor as
well. Ann Arbor is viewed nationwide as one of
the best college towns. But I spend most of my
time in University buildings and facilities. And
despite the occasional meal on State St., I rarely
venture out of my home at dinnertime, especial-
ly during these harsh Michigan winters. With
only a year and a half left here, I hope that the
city will increase advertisements on campus, so
that I will be able to fully take advantage of all
that is offered in Ann Arbor.

Do, ask, do tell

Terrorism is not the only topic currently under attack
in Iraq and Afghanistan. On Tuesday, Defense Secretary
Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Adm. Mike Mullen, brought a proposal before Congress to
overturn "Don't ask, Don't tell," a much-discussed regula-
tion that prohibits gay people from serving in the United
States military. The policy, ironically enacted for the bet-
terment of the gay community, has afflicted countless men
and women, along with their families and troops.
We live in a time during which racial or religious dis-
crimination is intolerable. And we live in a country that
was founded on the ideal of freedom of speech. So howis
it acceptable for people to be forced to hide their beliefs
or be subjected to such judgmental punishment if they
refuse to do so?
Former President Bill Clinton used this policy as a
scapegoat instead of overturning the ban against gay men
and women entirely. And while it was an improvement, it
was still a far stretch from the most moral option. Since
it was created in 1993, the policy has discharged over
12,000 people, whether they were actually gay or simply
suspected to be.
U.S. Army Lieutenant Dan Choi, a graduate of the West
Point Military Academy, was an Arabic translator specialist
for the United States Army before he was dismissed in June
2009. Choi, who was referred to by many members of Con-
gress as an "exceptional" soldier, represents a large group of
people who are key figures in our military but are punished
for telling the truth. Discharging an Arabic translator - a
position that is already difficult to fill - is a hazardous deci-
sion. Without proficient Arabic speakers, there is inevitable
chaos amongst civilians, leaders and soldiers.
This past November, ABC News reported that over 52
percent of the population disapproves of the wars in Iraq

and Afghanistan. Our country is stuck in a commitment
that puts thousands of our troops in harms way. The men
and women that enlist understand they are knowingly
and willingly stepping into potentially dire situations. In
circumstances such as these, the military is inno position
to turn away anyone willing to fight. And in doing so they
are thinning a population that is already too thin.
According to a Gallup poll conducted last May, over
69 percent of American adults - including liberals, con-
servatives and independents - were in favor of allowing
openly gay people in the military. And while some argue
that the policy is in place to protect the gay community,
whom they believe would face uncontrollable backlash
from other soldiers, many military men are standing up
against this claim. General Colin Powell, the nation's top
military officer in the 1990s and a supporter of the regula-
tion under President Clinton, is now speaking out that it
should be overturned.
In a country as strong and advanced as ours, military
authorities should be able to find a way to allow men and
women to publicly express their views without retaliation
from their peers. Around the globe, there are over 30 coun-
tries that currently allow openly gay men and women in
their military service, including the United Kingdom - a
country that fights with us abroad. This number has in fact
increased by about 30 percent in the past three years, with
seven more countries lifting the ban since 2007.
Congress is in a position to finally bury this topic.
There is no fair way to compromise. All people, regard-
less of their sexual orientation, are qualified and capable
of serving in the military. And in "the land of the free," it's
about time we start letting our soldiers live freely.

Grady gives 'M' quiet support

by NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
He's entirely behind the scenes.
Kelvin Grady, former Michi-
gan point guard and current slot
receiver for the football team, is
impacting the
Michigan men's NOTEBOOK
basketball team
behind closed doors in his return
as a scout-team player for the Wol-
verines.
And after nearly two weeks of
basketball practices with Grady in
attendance,, those on the inside are
giving Grady rave reviews.
After Michigan beat Iowa last
Saturday, sophomore point guard
Stu Douglass, who matches up
against Grady each day in practice,
gave a lot of credit to the Wolver-
ines' scout team for preparations
during the week. He said Grady, in
particular, has helped simulate the
speed and talent of Big Ten point
guards.
"No disrespect to (freshman
walk-on) Josh Bartlestein, but it's
a lot different with Kelvin Grady,"
Douglass said after beating Iowa.
"You know, I was setting up for a
screen one time, and I was wait-
ing for him to come off it a little
methodically, and he just went
right into the lane, and I was just
sitting there lost.
"He's helped us tremendously,
especially playing (Michigan State
guard) Kalin Lucas and (Iowa
guard) Cully Payne here."
Douglass added that he has
enjoyed having Grady back off the
court, too. It's likely the intangible
benefits, like a positive personal-
ity back in .the locker room, that
made it easy for Michigan basket-
ball coach John Beilein to welcome
Grady back to the program.
So far, the only complaints
Beilein has had about the entire
situation surround scheduling dif-
ficulties because of Grady's partici-
pation in both programs and NCAA
regulations on practice hours.
"We're still working that out,"
Beilein said last week. "It's more
complicated than people would
think. I'm sure back in the old days,
some guy would just show up for

basketball practice, a football play-
er might just show up for basket-
ball practice and scrimmage and
nobody even knew he was on the
team. It's different."
If Grady sat on the bench dur-
ing a game, it would count as three
hours toward his weekly allowable
total.
On the other side of things,
Michigan football coach Rich
Rodriguez has also taken a positive
approach to Grady's multi-sport
interest.
"When we talked, I could tell he
really wanted to, and he probably
missed it," Rodriguez said during
halftime of Saturday's basketball
game. "As I told him, 'If you can
feel you can contribute and have
fun doing it, then why not?' John
(Beilein) and I talked about it, and
I'm all for those guys as long as
they can contribute and as long as
they don't affect their studies, and
it doesn't seem to be affecting his
studies at all."
SIZE MATTERS: Basketball ana-
lysts like to say that Beilein's Wol-
verines "live or die" by their 3-point
shooting. And since Michigan has
struggled to score this season when
its outside shooting has gone cold,
that critique doesn't sound like
such a stretch.
"To score points, we don't have
a lot of other options right now,"
Beilein said last week. "We're not
the biggest team. We're not the
quickest team."
Speed and agility can be
improved, but size is something
that the Wolverines don't have.
Michigan's tallest starter, senior
forward DeShawn Sims, is listed at
6-foot-8.
At one pointrin the not-so-distant
past, it didn't look like the Wolver-
ines would have a roster lacking
height. Two years ago, Beilein was
recruiting two guys for his sys-
tem, and they were tall: Germany's
6-foot-10 Robin Benzing and 7-foot
Ben Cronin.
Benzing didn't qualify academi-
cally for Michigan, and Cronin
redshirted last year and had hip
surgery, which he hasn't recovered
from.
Currently, Benzing is tearing up

From Page 1A
action - like voting - would
have occurred, Fitzgerald said.
If action of that nature had taken
place, the regents would have had
to hold a special meeting - for
which more information would
have been publicly available.
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail to
the Daily that because the meet-
ing was informal, no minutes were
taken of the meeting's activities.
"There are no minutes of infor-
mal meetings," Fitzgerald wrote
in an e-mail.
When asked by reporters about
the meeting at a press conference
held this afternoon for National
Signing Day, Michigan Football
coach Rich Rodriguez said he
hadn't heard anything about it.
"No, I don't know anything

"accountability, efficiency and
reliability by creating a struc-
tured but collaborative envi-
ronment for committees and
commissions," according to the
S4PG website.
Stressing cooperation among
committees, the website also
states that the new central legis-
lative branch will "shift student
government from a culture of iso-
lation-to that of collaboration."
Rorro said S4PG willbegin peti-
tioning next Tuesday for signa-
tures in an effort to get the revised
document on the student ballot for
the MSA elections in March.
S4PG, he said, needs 1,000 sig-
natures by Feb. 17 in order to put
PERNA
From Page 1A
Perna echoed sentiments made
by President Barack Obama, who
has said he hopes America will
once again have the highest pro-
portion of college graduates in
the world by 2020.
To meet the president's goal,
Perna said each state will have
to, on average, increase its
annual number of awarded col-
lege degrees by eight percent.
Michigan will have to increase
its annual output of higher edu-
cation students by 8.4 percent.
"Performance has improved in
this state, but it is still below the
levels of top states," Perna said.
Perna added that the educa-
tional gap in Detroit is notable
with 32 percent of black students
graduating from high school
compared to a 45-percent gradu-
ation rate for their white peers.
College enrollment has followed
suit with fewer black students

about that," he said.
Asked if he should be in closer
contact with the regents regard-
ing the investigation, Rodriguez
said he knows University offi-
cials will continue to keep him
informed.
"We're all interested," he said.
"They won't keep me in the dark.
They'll let us know in due time."
Fitzgerald said he didn't know.
whether the NCAA report had
been submitted to the University.
NCAA Vice President for
Enforcement David Price wrote in
an Oct. 23 letter to Coleman that
he hoped to finish the investiga-
tion by the end of 2009. Howeyer,
the letter stated the date was a
goal, not a deadline. On Dec. 31,
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said University
officials had not yet received an
update on the investigation.
"We haven't received word

from the NCAA," Cunningham
wrote in an e-mail to the Daily at
the time. "The process is moving
along as anticipated."
Allegations of misconduct by
the University's football pro-
gram were first brought forth in
a Detroit Free Press article pub-
lished in late August. The Free
Press cited multiple anonymous
Michigan football players who
described the team's practice
schedules as violating NCAA reg-
ulations.
Immediately after the report
from the Free Press was pub-
lished, University officials
launched an internal investiga-
tion into the allegations. Howev-
er, no updates or comments on the
internal investigation have been
issued since it began.
- Daily Sports Editor Nicole
Auerbach contributed to this report.


the revised constitution up for a
campus-wide vote. Rorro said he
is optimistic about finishing the
document before the upcoming
deadline.
"It is almost a complete work-
ing document," Rorro said. "But
it still can change."
Rorro said though the docu-
ment is pretty much done, the
group is still "revising heavily,"
adding-that they are prioritizing
getting a document that students
are happy with over meeting the
deadline.
"If it comes down to the fact
that we are not ready to do it,
and there is a lot of contentious
debate, then we are going to push
it along and maybe do it next
year," he said.
Rorro said he and S4PG mem-
ber Phillip Zeeck will be listen-

ing to opinions from student
organizations in a town hall
meeting today. A similar meeting
held last week detailed the new
proposed changes to the consti-
tution. About 20 people - mostly
current members of student gov-
ernment - were in attendance.
Obtaining 1,000 signatures
could be a huge obstacle to get-
ting the document on the ballot,
Rorro said. If revisions to the
constitution were made through
MSA, the changes could have
been resolved internally without
votes from the student body.
If the group gets enough sig-
natures and their version of the
code makes it on the ballot, then
the results from the MSA elec-
tions on March 24 will determine
whether the proposed revision
will be adopted by the assembly.

GRANHOLM
From Page 1A
drawn a warning from Granholm
that state departments - like the
Department of Education - may
have to absorb a 20-percent cut
in stateappropriations in the next
fiscal year.
In addition to discussing the res-
toration of the Promise Scholarship,
Granholm's speech emphasized
diversifying the state's investments
to compensate for the flagging auto
industry, which she said has lost
78 percent of its jobs in the last ten
years.
"Our economy has changed. The
old Michigan is gone," she said.
"Everything we do in these next
11 months should be linked to the
economic plan we have followed
these seven years: diversifying the
economy, educating our people, and
protecting citizens in a time of tran-
sition."
Granholm highlighted several of
the state's job-creating forays into
thecleanenergyindustry,likeDow's
electricity-producing solar shingle, a

SIGNING DAY

nobody on this football team that
we're signing that has a misde-
meanor conviction," Rodriguez
said. "You have to look at the
whole story before you pass judg-
ment on a young man. Not every-
body is perfect. Sometimes young
people get in the wrong situation
at the wrong time, but they're
found innocent or they're acquit-
ted.
"We feel comfortable that
every guy we sign is going to be
a great fit for not only the football
program but for this university
and our community," he contin-
ued.
Following Rodriguez's press
conference, offensive coordina-
tor Calvin Magee agreed with
the head coach, accentuating the
importance of character in the
Wolverines' recruiting efforts.
"Every kid we recruit, we
spend an awful lot of time, prob-
ably more than anything on char-
acter," he said. "... just like the
other kids we recruited, we saw
a kid that has good character and
we had no problems with it."

ted to play at the University of
Florida, and he held that commit-

Granholmalsoaskedlegislatorsto

said costs much less than it attracts
- as part of an effort to bring more
tourism dollars to the state.

increasing efforts to educate the
state's workforce, including an
expansion of the No Workdr Left
Behind initiative that would open
ten learning labs in Detroit and cre-
ate a new training program available
to 1,000 prospective entrepreneurs
at small-business locations around
the state.
"The businesses we want to grow
in Michigan don't justneed financial
capital, they need human capital
too," Granholm said.
She spotlighted Jocelyn Harris, a
Detroit schoolteacher who received
a $15,000 loan to begin a produce
business in her community that pre-
viously lacked available fresh pro-
duce, as a model ofentrepreneurship
in practice.
Granholm also called on leg-
islators to provide a tax credit to
investors who make venture capital
available to Michiganbusinesses.
After an impassioned listing of
businesses that are creating jobs, a
visibly emotional Granholm broke
from script to thank the legislature
for their service and her family for
their support during her adminis-
tration.
GARDNER'S DEBUT
As the top-rated dual threat
quarterback in the country, Michi-
gan recruit Devin Gardner's repu-
tation precedes him.
But now that he is on campus
- after graduating early from Ink-
ster High School in order to enroll
this semester - Gardner willibegin
workouts today to become compet-
itive at the quarterback position.
"I think it will help me mentally
and physically, you know, because
of the weight room work out and
conditioning," Gardner said. "I'll
probably be in the best shape of
my life, and learning the plays and
stuff like that."
The quarterback situation is a
bit different from last year though
when former Wolverine Steven
Threet's transfer left Nick Sheri-
dan as the only non-freshman hav-
ing started under center.
And with Tate Forcier having
started every game for Michigan
last season and fellow freshman
Denard Robinson taking snaps, the
competition has stiffened for the
role of signal caller.
"I don't want to discount (Gard-
ner). because he's a very competi-
tive guy," Rodriguez said. "But
you're going to assume that Tate
and Denard are going take a step
forward ... Another spring practice
for them, another August camp
for them. I think Tate and Denard
are going to keep doing this in the

In an interview after the speech,
State Sen. Tom George (R-Kalam-
azoo) said he was skeptical of the
return of the Promise Scholarship
because of Granholm's decision to
prioritize health care spending.
"Before you're engaging in new
programs orreinstatingthe Promise
Scholarship, you've got to explain
how you're going to close that hole,
and we can't dothatuntilwe stop the
diversions to health care," George
said of the state's budget shortfall.
"The math doesn't work yet"
Before and during the speech,
some 300 people from in different
groups protested in front of the capi-
tol.
The Undergraduate Alliance, a
student advocacy group made up of
students from universities around
the state, demonstrated against the
potentialstatecutstoeducationwith
chants of "Bail out the students, not
the banks."
Sam Inglot, a sophomore at Mich-
igan State University and a member
of the UGA, said he didn't expect to
be satisfied by Granholm's speech.
"It's going to take a serious
revamping of government and a lot
of pressure from the people to actu-
ally get them to prioritize educa-
tion,"hesaid.
Inglot estimated that the UGA
rally included 100 students from
Michigan State, Grand Valley State
University and Western Michigan
University.
offense.
"I think it's a good situation in
a way for (Gardner). I'm glad he's
here this spring because at least
he'll know and we'll know how far
away he is."
Magee said he knows Gardner
has the potential to be successful
in Ann Arbor, after leading Inkster
to the state championship this past
season.
"They're rawskils," Magee said.
"I can't wait for coach Smith to
get a hold of him to tighten up his
fundamentals ... When you watch
him play, he loves to compete, and
watching him, he looks like the
kind of kid that.gets other players
around him to get going."
LB COACH SEARCH
With the position of linebacker
coach still vacant after Jay Hopson
left to become the defensive coor-
dinator at Memphis in December,
and the excitement of signing day
now over, Rodriguez said he will
pick up the search for Hopson's
replacement in the next week.
Because defensive coordinator
Greg Robinson is now likely coach-
ing the linebackers, Rodriguez said
the newly added staff member will
likely be "more of a safeties coach
than a linebackers coach."
ThoughRodriguezsaidhewould
like to hire the new coach in the
next week, he said he doesn't want
to put a timeframe on the hire.


enrolling in college, she said.
"We have a lot of information
out there about college, but I
think the challenge is more the
fact that these gaps exist despite
the availability of information,"
she said. "We have to turn that
information into knowledge and
make that knowledge usable,
understandable and relevant."
Affordability, Perna said, is an
underlying issue that students
face when thinking about col-
lege. She said there is an ongo-
ing trend of tuition becoming too
expensive, placing a burden on
the families of students.
In Detroit, 42 percent of fami-
lies with children live below the
poverty line while a quarter of
children live in families with
unemployed parents.
"Financial aid is most impor-
tant in students' decisions to
enroll in college," Perna said. "It
influences the resources they
have available to pay for col-
lege."
Looking beyond the financial

issues plaguing higher education,
Perna said university outreach
programs are essential. She said
there are few comprehensive pro-
grams, which address academic
preparation, financial standing
and parental involvement.
"Higher education institu-
tions, particularly research
institutions, are the strategic
agent for the effect and demo-
cratic transformation of society's
school system," Perna said.
Gloria Thomas, director of
the Center for.the Education of
Women in Pennsylvania, who
was involved in the discussion
in Rackham, said she agrees that
universities play an important
role in promoting higher educa-
tion.
"A lot of institutions do their
own individual initiatives and
outreach efforts," Thomas
said. "But there is a real need
to address these issues, particu-
larly for Detroit and the state of
Michigan in a real collaborative
effort."

unexpected. Be ready to dance in either
direction. Stay light on your feet.
LEO
(July 23 toAug.22)
The introduction of new technology at
work is exciting. (Yes, there's always
that painful learning curve.) Surprise
news that is health-related or related to
small pets also is likely.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Unexpected flirtations might make
your day. Some of these flirtations could
blossom into new romance! You're full

ilant about children, because this could

undercurrent that you feel with every-
thing.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
A friend might surprise you today.
Alternatively, you might make a new
friend today. If this is the case, this per-

YOU BORN TODAY You're intu-
itive, and you have flashes of inspiration.
You're curious about everything in life.
You're intelligent, and you think fast on
your feet. As you grow older, your per-
sonal freedom and your quest for knowl-
edge become more precious. You also
become bolder about asserting yourself
with others! (Ha!) Your year ahead is the
beginning of something new and fresh.
Open any door!

ON DISPLAY
"Chasing Shadows"
is South African pho-
tojournalist Santu
Mofokeng's latest
exhibit. This photo-
graphic series of eerie
landscapes seeks to
explore the themes of
ownership, loss and
spirituality and, accord-
ing to the Institute for
the Humanities's web-
site, meditate on "the
profound absurdity of
living." "Chasing Shad-
ows" opens tomorrow
and is housed at 202
South Thayer Street,
Room 1010. The exhibit
is open from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. Admission is free.

ON DVD
You've heard the rave
reviews. Now it has
been nominated for
nine Oscars, includ-
ing Best Picture. Do
yourself a favor and
experience "The Hurt
Locker," available on
DVD and Blu-ray. This
story of soldiers defus-
ing bombs in Iraq is
a masterpiece - an
expertly directed
character study with
more thrills than "Ava-
tar" (and made with
1/33 of its budget).

MAKING OF THE MINOR
The Museum Studies Minor, launched last se
ter, is a direct result of the graduate certificate
gram's success. Since its creation in 2003, the gra
certificate program has garnered great interest as
undergraduates.
"It was largely the result of a lot of undergrad
coming to me and saying, 'Hey it's really nice tha

'U' symposium views photography through two conflicting lenses

Artists of differing
backgrounds meet to
discuss the medium
By ADDIE SHRODES
Daily Arts Writer
For contemporary photogra-
phers, the Information Age creates
an ocean of images that prompts

a sea of questions. But one query
floats atop the waves: What does
it mean to be an image-maker in a
world of countless images?
"So much of my time is spent
wading through this giant pool
of photographs, and I feel over-
whelmed by them," said profession-
al photographer Alec Soth. "I know
a lot of professional photographers
who feel the same way."
The two-part History of Art

Symposium "Contemporary Strate-
gies in Documentary Photography"
presents three diverse speakers
who address the shifts in documen-
tary photography, as well as its his-
torical context.
History of Art Professors Mat-
thew Biro and Alexander Potts
spent a year planning the sympo-
sium, and they specifically chose
photographers who represent the
two divisions of photography: fine

art and documentary.
Soth, who spoke during the sym-
posium's first day, Jan. 30, personi-
fies the fine art spectrum, which is
increasingly influenced by a docu-
mentary tradition "interested in
defining and influencing society,"
Biro said.

tographer and prominent theoreti-

scheduled to speak on Saturday,
helps define a historical context.
And the division of genres has a

Ending mindless eating

David Merritt's inspiration came from the camaraderie of the Michigan men's basketball team.

Hardwood to runway

Former 'M' basketball captain
David Merritt's fashion line
promotes community service
By KRISTYN ACHO
Daily Arts Writer
At Sunday's IMU photoshoot, LSA sophomore
Courtney Cox took a brief break from tweeting
giveaways to describe her unique internship expe-
rience. Like many Michigan students, Cox had
been hopelessly looking for internship opportuni-
ties in merchandising, until she came across the
Facebook fan page for I Miss You, Inc. (IMU), a
brand founded by David Merritt, former captain of
the Michigan men's basketball team.
"Have you ever had someone tell you that they
miss you?" Merritt asked. "It makes you feel spe-
cial. It makes you feel valued."
David Merritt is not the typical self-absorbed
all-star-athlete-turned-fashion-designer. If you're
looking for an entourage or the arrogant swagger
that comes with leading a team to the NCAA tour-
nament for the first time in 11 years, you won't find
it here. Instead, Merritt is so admirably humble,
it's almost frustrating. He just keeps it real - and
stylish. He has everything you'd hope to find in the
. president and CEO of one of Ann Arbor's hottest

up-and-coming fashion lines.
But how did the former hoops player combine
his two seemingly disparate interests of basketball
and fashion?
According to Merritt, he never had any inten-
tions of getting involved in fashion. But his expe-
riences playing basketball with selfless teammates
like School of Public Policy graduate student and
former captain C.J. Lee ultimately became his
inspiration for IMU.
"As a captain, I learned the importance of self-
lessness and giving of yourself to reach team goals
- goals that are bigger than you personally." Mer-
ritt said. "Like watching C.J. Lee come in every day
just to motivate people in order to make the team
as good as it could be. These types of goals are
what's really behind IMU as a brand."
The IMU brand sells T-shirts which combine the
urban style with joy and color. The shirt designs
serve perfectly to illustrate the meeting point of
style and service.
And the IMU brand isn't just a fashion line; it's
a mission statement. Merritt wants each customer
to feel a sense of belonging, value and, most impor-
tantly, community.
"We want to make people happy, we want to
make people feel special, but at the same time we
want them to realize that they are unique as indi-
viduals due to their experiences and the communi-

we seem to eat

the holidays rep-

stop with the flip of a new calendar?
And how could the start of a new

age a new outlook on food, when
cheap pizza joints like Backroom

Mindless eating is everywhere.

I tend to hit the cookie jar. A 2000
study in the New England Journal

cans gain about a pound between
Thanksgiving and the New Year,
and rarely shed it. During my
holiday break I picked up a book,
grabbed a sandwich and learned
what I was doing wrong.
"Peace Is Every Step," by Bud-
dhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, is
all about regaining touch with the
peace every moment offers. It has
a section about eating mindfully,
which suggests that "the purpose
of eating is to eat." I had to quickly

the rare book collection, are just
unparalleled."
APROMISING FUTURE
As for the future of the Museum
Studies minor, there are no cur-
rent plans to expand the program
into a concentration. Silverman
believes that as "soon as you start
forming a major, you start building
walls around it," as only certain
students with specific aims will
take the courses.
However, Silverman and Taylor
both agree that if a significant stu-
dent interest in a Museum Studies
concentration should form, they
would consider creating a program.
But until then, Taylor assures inter-
ested students that they "have plans
for further developing the minor."
Piegza, who also feels if should

remain a minor, elaborated on
what some of these developments
may be.
"I hope that maybe in the future
we'll be able to offer more classes,
but it's all based on interest and
that's something that you can't
necessarily predict," she said. "But
I'm extremely optimistic."
Despite the overwhelming
response from the student body,
Silverman and Taylor don't plan
to cut down the program to fit
their original projections. Only
25 students were expected to take
Museums 301 last semester, but 70
enrolled. Thirty declarations for
the minor were expected in a five
year trajectory, but this goal was
reached in the first year.
Nor do Silverman and Taylor
intend to mirror the competitive-
ness of the graduate certificate

program, which only admits 13 to
15 students per year.
"The onlything thatwill limit the
number of students we can admit
would be our resources," Silverman
said. "And so far, the college has
been quite generous in supporting
the unanticipated interest."
But one thing is certain - the.
program will remain as fluid as
its field of focus. The minor will
accommodate the kaleidoscopic
viewpoints that students and pro-
fessionals have concerning the
museum world:
"This is a great time to study
museums and work in museums.
It makes you think, 'What could
I do to change the field?' because

it's so open," Malzahn said. "It
makes me feel like I can actually
do something because there's so
much going on."
"I think (museums are) a way
to promote intellectual curiosity,
which is something very impor-
tant and that maybe gets over-
looked in formal education," said
LSA sophomore Laura Mason.
"(Museums') relevancy to soci-
ety is not only based on their col-
lections and their physicality and
their preservation, but also acting
as a cultural touchstone where you
can get a sense of your identity,"
Fournier said. "But, in the end I
think we're all just huge museum
dorks"

ty that surrounds them. So it's important for them to
give back and appreciate others," he said.
The foundations of the IMU brand are really in its
community service endeavors. Fashion is the perfect
vehicle to spread this type of message, because fash-
ion isn't just about clothing - it's about making state-
ments. People convey their beliefs and values through
their clothing. With his brand, Merritt hopes to con-
vey the message of happiness and community service
that he is so passionate about.
"Through our community service projects, we
hope to provide a direct impact on memories that will

not be forgotten, but missed," Merritt said.
Merritt views the brand as a challenge: Every IMU
employee is required to put in eight to ten hours of
community service per month. But he extends the
challenge to customers as well, with each t-shirt rep-
resenting and encouraging an hour of community
service from customers.
Customers who purchase an IMU T-shirt and then
do an hour of community service receive 20 percent
off their next purchase.
While his company is involved in many projects
in the Detroit metropolitan area, Merritt is most
passionate about the convergence of arts and aca-
demics in the educational system. Accordingly, IMU
partnered with the educational organization Beyond
Basics to host the Thirkell Elementary MLK Jr.
Expressions Contest, in which both organizations

helped young students write and illustrate stories.
"Thirkell students and teachers were very touched
by the MLK Expressions experience. They loved hav-
ing the oportunity to bond with a group as diverse
as the IMU Inc. team. Everyone left our room with
ear-to-ear smiles," Beyond Basics Program Director
Khadigah Alasry said.
Eighteen semi-finalists will receive awards for both
writing and art. Prizes include private coachingsessions
with a professional author or artist, as well as a compi-
lation of a book including work from each semi-finalist.
Finally, in honor of Black History Month, the IMU team
will travel back to Thirkell Elementary to host various
prominent figures who lived during the Civil Rights
Movement to share their inspiring experiences with
students. Through these efforts, IMU is devoted to
keeping the arts alive in schools.
Cox, a Detroit native, finds the community ser-
vice work to be especially meaningful, because
IMU is ultimately working toward bettering the
educational system that she went through.
"Fashion is often solely superficial, but the IMU
brand is focused on bettering the surrounding com-
munity, especially in Detroit where you can really
make a difference," Cox said.
She also talked of the benefits of working under

someone as modest and approachable as Merritt.
"(Merritt) is young and is always interested in get-
ting our input. You really feel like you're an integral
part of the brand," Cox said.
As long as the brand stays true to its altruistic,
community service-oriented vision, Merritt hopes to
expand the company.
He views Ann Arbor as the ideal location for
the foundation of the IMU brand and is looking for
University students like Cox who are interested in
internship opportunities.
"We offer class credit for fashion students," Mer-
ritt said. "From photography to economics to engi-
neering, we want it all."
As an intern, Cox works at IMU four hours a week,
doing community service work, making fundraising
schedules, writing blog posts and discussing ways to
expand the brand.
This month, IMU is unveiling IMUGrind with the
new line, "IMU is reclaiming plaid."
"We are taking what was once worn primarily by
blue collar workers, lumberjacks and farmers, and
making it our own." Merritt explained.
Whether you're an artist, scholar, athlete or lum-
berjack, IMU supports your grind and invites you to
pursue your passions in style.

SYMPOSIUM
From Page 2B
frame of reference, while Soth
leaves interpretation to the viewer.
"In his books, Soth gives very
little information about the envi-
ronment of these photographs,

and sort of allows the photographs
to speak for themselves," Potts said.
"Sekula takes a rather different
view and says, 'Well the thing is,
the photographs don't quite speak
for themselves. You need some kind
of contextual information in order
for them to really deliver.'"
However, 40-year-old Soth
readily acknowledged that his best-
known work has "struggled for
narrative," and he is avidly devel-
oping a new approach.
"The work I've done exists in
the fine-art context, and it's no
different than me in a basement
finger-painting in some ways,"
Soth explained. "While I con-
tinue in that vein, I'm also really
exploring how to tell photograph-
ic stories actively."
In his lecture, Soth, a member
of the documentary photography
group Magnum Photo, presents
the four-billionth photograph
uploaded on Flickr, illustrating
how that image resembles a pho-
tograph by William Eggleston,
who Soth called "a contemporary
master." Soth's lecture title, "The
Democratic Jungle," plays off
Eggleston's idea of a "democratic
forest," in which everything can
be made a subject of meaningful
photography.
"In the '60s and'70s, photogra-
phers were realizing that the most
mundane street corner could

hold rich cultural information,"
Soth said. "In the digital age, these
fragments, to me, mean less and
less. The forest is overgrown - it's
tangled with images and informa-
tion. So, jokingly, I say that photog-
raphy should provide a narrative
machete. It's like cutting away the
story to find your way through."
His emerging strategy is thus a
direct response to the metaphoric
ocean of photographs.
"Let the cell-phone people have
the raw documentation - they're
doing it," Soth explained. "But
to tell a story is a whole different
thing, and that requires a lot of
skill."
Yet, Soth does not agree with the
notion that documentary photogra-
phy should present objective truths
about its subject or society. Rather,
he is interested in documenting his
movement through the world.
"I equate this to the New Jour-
nalism of the 1970s - Tom Wolfe
and people like that who were cre-
ating this new first-person jour-
nalism, where they are getting rid
of that authoritative voice, that
sort of all-knowing voice, and say-
ing, 'this is my experience,' " Soth
explained.
That denial of complete objec-
tivity is of interest to Stein, who
will present her research on
female photographers from the
'20s to the '50s.
In an e-mail interview with the
Daily, Stein wrote that she evalu-
ates "strains of feminist thinking
and viewing" in work from an age
when "objectivity was most prized
in photography," illustrating how
bias always finds away to seep into
expression.
But Soth emphasized that his
subjective approach to photog-
raphy is still experimental. He is
developing a storytelling slide-
show blog for The New York Times
that will be a "foray into proving
my thesis or falling on my face."
Soth's work accordingly dove-
tails with the symposium's explor-
ative purpose.
"We really want a serious aca-
demic discussion on the nature
of photography in the contempo-
rary world," Potts said. "And in
order to get at this we want peo-
ple who have direct experience
and are key figures in the making
of photography."
