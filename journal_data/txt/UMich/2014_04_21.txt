Popular burger
joint announces
new S. Ashley
Street location
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
Ann Arborites, rejoice: Krazy
Jim's Blimpy Burger announced
its new location Friday, aiming to
reopen in late June at 304 S. Ash-
ley Street.
The new location is the for-
mer home of the Eastern Flame
restaurant, which served Indian
and Mediterranean food before it
closed last year. The space is on
the corner of W. Liberty and S.
Ashley streets.
The 551 S. Division Street loca-
tion closed August after the Uni-
versity purchased the property
for $1.075 million to make way
for Munger Graduate Residences
, much to thediscontent of Ann

Arbor residents and students.
However, Blimpy Burger did
not receive money from the sale
as a displaced tenant. Owner Rich
Magner started an Indiegogo
campaign to ensure the 60-year-
old Ann Arbor icon could contin-
ue divvyingup five-patty burgers
and deep-fried veggies.
The campaign began Dec. 13,
2013 and ended Jan. 25, 2014. It
raised more than $20,000 - fall-
ing short of its $60,000 goal.
"Thank you again for hav-
ing faith in us and pushing us
to make this happen," Blimpy
Burger's Facebook page wrote in
a post Friday. "We are blessed to
be a part of this community."
According to the Indiegogo
description, reopening would
cost more than $300,000. Funds
were needed for construction
costs, architect fees, new inven-
tory, kitchen and dining area
equipment and other expenses.

OptiMize finalists
awarded funding
for their winning
projects
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
At the Rackham Building Fri-
day, students pitched their start-
up ideas as part of the second

annual optiMize Social Innova-
tion Showcase.
OptiMize is a student organi-
zation that provides resources
for those seeking to implement
world-changing projects and
start-ups. LSA, United Way of
Washtenaw County, Innova-
tion Blue, Central Student Gov-
ernment and other University
affiliates provide funding for the
event.
In Dec. 2013, the founding
group of optiMize members

accepted applications from stu-
dents hoping to receive funding
for their social innovation ideas
in the optiMize Challenge.
By January 30 teams were
selected from a pool of 50. After
delivering pitches to a panel of
judges, five teams were chosen
as finalists earlier this month
and received a grant of $5,000.
The optiMize Showcase on
Friday celebrated the journey
from fuzzy ideas to fully formed
projects. The finalists discussed

their ideas to fellow students,
who then voted for a crowd
favorite to win an additional
$1,000.
Phil Deloria, LSA associate
dean for undergraduate educa-
tion, opened the program and
said the University as a "place
for learning" is an understate-
ment - learning also involves

bilities asa creator.

Neuromonitoring
specialization is the
first of its kind in
the nation
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
At this year's commencement,
students from a new bachelor's
program will be the first in the
nation to graduate as trained
intraoperative neuromonitoring
clinicians. This field concerns
recording bioelectrical activ-
ity of the spinal cord, nerves and
brain structures during surgery.
The IONM program, within
the movement science major in
the School of Kinesiology, trains
students to work as clinicians
in the operating room as they
monitor patients' nervous system
functions. It is the only under-
graduate program in the country
that offers this type of training.
Joshua Mergos, adjunct clini-
cal assistant professor of move-
ment science, is the educational
coordinator and primary faculty
member teaching program class-
es. He said students learn to pre-
vent injury that occurs during
surgical procedures and alert
surgeons to neurological changes
during the surgery.

"The science we apply in the
operating room has been around
for a while but our field has not
had a formal education track
developed for it," Mergos said.
Previously, hospitals had to
train students with a background
in the life sciences to perform
these specific operations. They
often invested in a clinician who
was likely to transfer jobs in two
or three years.
Now, these graduating stu-
dents are encountering promis-
ing career opportunities, Mergos
said. Students who are trained
in the field are in high demand;
neuromonitorist salaries average
between $60,000 and $70,000
annually. The training can also
lead to medical school or hospital
management.
Kinesiology senior Ryan
Wino, graduating from the
IONM program next month, is
interviewing for jobs at the Beau-
mont Hospital's Royal Oak cam-
pus and the University Hospital,
among other hospitals.
"Everyone is really impressed
and interested to learn more
about the program," Winn said.
"(University of) Michigan Hos-
pital offers all kinds of surgeries
that you don't often get tosee."
The main types of surgeries
IONM specialists are involved
in are orthopedic spinal surgery

Four French journalists Z
home after Syrian captivity , J

Reporters were
kidnapped by
Islamic extremists
in separate incidents
PARIS (AP) - Four French
journalists kidnapped and held
for 10 months in Syria returned
home Sunday to joyful families,
a presidential welcome and ques-
tions about how France managed
to obtain their freedom from
Islamic extremists.
Edouard Elias, Didier Fran-
cois, Nicolas Henin and Pierre
Torres were freed Saturday by
their kidnappers at the Turkish
border. They were captured in
two separate incidents last June.
Francois recounted details
of the captivity on Europe 1
radio, saying there were periods
of "total isolation," numerous
transfers to new locations and,
sometimes, chains to guard
- U5

against escape.
The four were kidnapped
in two separate incidents last
June, and it was unclear how
much time they spent together.
Since his capture, Francois said
he felt like he had been living
in a "black hole ... in basements
without seeing daylight, includ-
ing a month and a half chained
one to another."
"It's such a delight and a
relief to be free, to see the sky ...
to breath the fresh air, to walk,
to talk to you;" said Francois, 53,
a noted war reporter for Europe
1.
Elias, 23, a freelance photog-
rapher, also was working for
Europe 1 radio. Henin, 37, and
Torres, 29, are freelance jour-
nalists.
At an emotional welcome cer-
emony at Villacoublay military
airport outside Paris, President
Francois Hollande saluted their
return as "a moment of joy" for
their families and France.
5-m

Hollande praised Turk-
ish authorities for helping in
the journalists' return, but
didn't elaborate. It was unclear
whether Turkey played a role in
the negotiations to obtain the
journalists' freedom. The four
were released at the Turkish-
Syrian border and found by
Turkish police.
Hollande insisted that France
honored its policy of not paying
ransoms.
"It's a very important prin-
ciple so that hostage-takers are
not tempted to capture others,"
Hollande told Europe 1. He
stressed the role of negotiations
and intelligence work - as he
has in the past when hostages
were freed, notably in Mali,
where two French remain in
captivity.
Foreign Minister Laurent
Fabius, in response to a question,
told Europe 1 that no weapons
were delivered to the Islamic
radicals holdingthe four.
"There was no question of
contact with the Syrian govern-
ment" of Bashar Assad, Fabius
said. France and other Western
nations blame Assad for Syria's
civil war and want him removed
from power.
"So it was of another nature,"
he said, suggesting some bargain
was struck.
The journalists' captors
haven't been formally identified,
although the Islamic State of Iraq
and the Levant, among the most
radical of the Islamic groups
operating in Syria, are suspected.
A Syrian who served as translator
and guide for two of the journal-
ists said that breakaway al-Qaida
group surely captured them in
the eastern province of Raqqa.
Hussam al-Ahmad, 23, told
The Associated Press that
Henin and Torres aroused the
fighters' suspicion after they
entered a school and asked to
take pictures of the fighters as
they played soccer. The jour-
nalists were seized four days
after an initial interrogation, al-
Ahmad said.

sented their ideas for bettering
the world through social innova-
tion. The five teams included Go
Green Technologies, Synapse,
Miscellania, Blueprints for Pan-
gaea and STARR Movement.
Go Green Technologies won
the $1,000 crowd vote award.
This team developed a low-cost,
efficient alternative to home
energy systems. LSA freshmen
Praveen Loganathan and Alex-
ander Cox, Go Green Technolo-
gies' creators, engaged with the
audience to solidify their motto:
"Go Blue, Stay Green."
The freshmen will build their
first Go Green-powered home
this summer, which will use
solar, wind and hydrogen ener-
gies paid for in monthly incre-
ments of $250 for 10 years. Their
product reduces a home's aver-
age carbon footprint by 80 per-
cent.
Cox created the idea as a soph-
omore in high school, but put it
on the back burner. After he and
Loganathan met in their Baits
Residence Hall dorm this year,
the two decided to combine their
talents and bring the idea to life.
"Anywhere at Michigan, peo-
ple are so open and friendly that
you can make a new friend, a new
business partner," Loganathan
said.
Loganathan, who is also a
member of the Ross Preparation
Initiative Learning Commu-
nity, said he was initially afraid
of taking the first steps towards
becoming an entrepreneur and
having confidence in his own
abilities.
"But the aspect of 'Why not

it; I have the necessary knowl-
edge to do it," Loganathan said.

However, this year, students
focused on the local community
and the University. Other stu-
dents had a global point-of-view.
For example, Blueprints for

medical supplies to low resource
areas in Ghana, intending to
expand to other nations. STARR

attend University of Michigan --
Dearborn, provide mentorship
to area students who are failing

Information graduate stu-
dent Tim Pituch, who is pur-
suing a degree in health
informatics,founded optiMize
with University alum Jeff
Sorensen.
Pituch said the group has
grown significantly since its
inception just over a year ago.
More than twice as many stu-
dents applied to the challenge
this year, more workshops were
offered to contestants and fund-
ing increased from $26,000 to
$33,000.
Sorensen added that the con-
nections within the group itself
have continued to expand as past
finalists choose to stay involved.
The group hopes to allow
more teams the opportunity to
present their ideas and gain rep-
resentation among more Univer-
sity colleges.
In addition to maintaining an
expanding network of past and
current teams, optiMize Social
Innovation is offering four mini-
courses in "critical issues" for
the Fall 2014 semester. They will
focus on education, health, ener-
gy, environment and Detroit.
Buisness graduate student
Chris Roszell, who is in his first
year of the Master of Entrepre-
neurship Program, is a member
in the Social Innovation group.
He said the courses supports the
group's mission.
"The programis unique in that
it brings together students from
such a diverse range of academ-
ic backgrounds," said Roszell.
"All of these creative ideas and
thoughts to really affect posi-
tive change in our communities
around us, and even across the
state and country."

tionally, she said she is currently
meeting with CSG representa-
tives to stay in tuned to the dif-
ferent goals and initiatives they
will be working on in the fall
semester.
Dishell said he hopes to contin-
ue their main initiatives through-
out the summer. These include
collaboration with the Alumni
Association and the LEAD Schol-
ars Program, creating a mental
health peer support network and
developing a mobile ticketing
system with the Athletic Depart-
ment.
These initiatives are all con-
tinuations of original platform
points from Dishell and Shokar's
campaign with Make Michigan.
A resolution involving working
with the Alumni Association on
expanding the LEAD Scholars
program and allocating CSG
funds was already introduced
Tuesday night at the assembly's
first meeting.
Dishell said he would be in
contact with the Athletic Depart-
ment throughout the summer to
work on introducing mobile tick-
eting as soon as possible. He said
it is possible that a mobile system
will be in place for the upcoming
basketball season with a pilot to
run at one football game.
Athletic Director Dave Bran-
don recently spoke to CSG and
commented on the thousands
of season tickets that go unused
every game. Mobile ticketing
would make it easier for students
to transfer tickets to one another,
helping to eradicate this issue of
empty seats.
Dishell added that repealing
the keg law is another priority

CSG will work on immediately to
address student safety. The keg
law requires that a tag with the
customer's name, address, phone

attached to each keg sold, better
preventing purchases by under-
age students.
The law went into effect in 2011
with the initial intent of curb-
ing underage drinking, but back-
fired since many now prefer hard
liquor. Dishell said there have
been visible increases in hard
liquor sales and alcohol-related
hospitalizations since the passage
of the law.
"It's something we came to a
realization about that we didn't
necessarily run on," he said.
"We've really seen a drinking
problem increase."
Dishell added that he hopes to
increase the support of arts at the
University in the upcoming year.
He said he wants to find ways to
encourage students who are not
in the School of Music, Theater &
Dance to be engaged in the per-
forming arts as well.
"The arts play an integral role
in education in helping bring
about things and workingthrough
problems," he said. "Making them
more accessible to students here
I think is really huge, whether
that's formally through classes
or whether that's informally
through studentgroups."
Both Dishell and Shokar held
key CSG roles over the past year,
as vice president and speaker of
the assembly, respectively, giv-
ing them a clear idea of how to
improve based on their experi-
ences so far.

In the past, Hip Hop Week

this year, organizers scheduled

Detroit gallery and a discussion
on drug use and hip-hop.
"A lot of times hip-hop or rap

Fall 2015, Mergos said.
"We want to give everyone

summer.
"There's a lot of opportunity
there for the assembly to really
work with the Commission and
work with the Program Commu-

making sure CSG is out there, on
the ground, besides when its elec-
tion time," Dishell said.
Executives appoint leaders of
Commissions, and applications
for these positions will be avail-
able in the summer. Committees
are extensions of the CSG Assem-
bly and will be finalized sometime
next week.
The Black Student Union was
one of the more prominent stu-
dent organizations that worked
with CSG in the past year. CSG
passed a resolution in support
of several of the BSU's goals for
increasing diversity on campus.
LSA junior Geralyn Gaines,
BSU vice speaker, is also new rep-
resentative serving on the CSG
Assembly. She said the BSU has
not made any formal decisions yet
for what to work on next year, but
her role will help with any future
CSG resolutions.
"There are almost 800 people
in the BSU listserv," she said. "I'll
be able to use that perspective,
and perspective of students out-
side the BSU, in order to gauge
what people want and what kind
of change they want to see, what
issues are most important to
them."
Overall, Dishell said he hopes
to increase CSG's visibility on
campus by attending more stu-
dent events and spending time
with more student organization
leaders.

more we can do," he said.

Before vote, Assad
visits seized village
as war continues

Syrian president's
trip attempts to
secure image as
minority protector
BEIRUT (AP) - Syria's
embattled president marked
Easter with a tour Sunday of an
ancient Christian village recent-
ly recaptured by his forces, an
important symbolic prize for
his government ahead of com-
ing presidential elections he
appears poised to contest.
President Bashar Assad's visit
to Maaloula, some 60 kilometers
(40 miles) northeast of Damas-
cus, serves a propaganda victory
for his government in its quest to
be seen as protector of religious
minorities as its civil war grinds
on.
Meanwhile, questions contin-
ue to swirl about allegations of
recent poison gas attacks in the
country, with French officials
saying Sunday there were indi-
cations that Assad's forces were
behind them.
Rebels, including fighters
from the al-Qaida-affiliated
Nusra Front, seized Maaloula
several times late last year, most
recently in December. Govern-
ment troops swept through the
village on Monday, sending rebel
fighters fleeing to nearby hills.
Despite damage to holy sites

in the village, Assad told Syrian
state television: "Maaloula will
remain steadfast in the face of
barbarism of all those who are
targeting the homeland."
"Nobody, regardless of the
extent of their terror, can erase
our cultural and human his-
tory," the state news agency
quoted Assad as saying as he
surveyed damage to the Mar
Takla Greek Orthodox monas-
tery in the village.
Assad promised to defend
Christians - who make up about
10 percent of Syria's prewar
population of 23 million - and
protect churches that he said
were part of the country's cul-
tural heritage. Syria's civil war
has seen Islamic extremists and
radical foreign fighters join the
fight and target Christians and
their houses of worship.
Many of Syria's patchwork of
minority Christian and Muslim
faiths support Assad or have
remained neutral, fearing for
their fate should hard-line rebel
groups seize power.
Assad's visit, while highlight-
ing the recent gains his forces
have made around the capital
and along the Lebanese border,
also took on the air of a cam-
paign-style event. On Monday,
Syria's parliament will open
registration for presidential can-
didates in its upcoming election,
scheduled to be held this sum-
mer.

Renovating campus connections
The new North Campus Grove project will promote a sense of community
tudents living on Central Campus hardly ever have a reason to go to
North Campus. The University's Board of Regents is trying to change
that with the North Campus Grove project. On April 17, the regents
approved a plan to invest $6.9 million into renovating the outdoor spaces on
North Campus. University administrators hope this will promote a sense of
community within North Campus itself and between the two campuses. The
area is an integral part of the University that should be better incorporated
into the student experience during their college careers, and the North
Campus Grove project will do just that.

Deconstructing the 'Two Cities' tale

With the assistance of gifts, the College of
Engineering will be funding the Grove project.
The project itself will focus on four acres of
land surrounding the Lurie Tower. These
renovations include building a brick plaza
which will be able to fit about 800 people and
will act as a site for students to hold meetings
and special events. Engineering Dean Dave
Munson has said there are also plans to
construct an amphitheater. Munson also noted
that a sandlot volleyball court and an ice-
skating rink are being considered. The project
will also plant trees, add walkways and seating
and improve lighting.
With North Campus so far removed from the
restaurants and bars of Central Campus, thereis
a noticeable difference in student life between
the two. An apparent lack of nightlife causes
many students to spend much of their free time
on Central Campus. Some students appreciate
North Campus's quietude, but many feel there is
a lack of activities to engage in. By constructing a
new plaza and amphitheater, students on North
Campus may be more inclined to hold public
events and gatherings, - promoting a sense
of community. Furthermore, North Campus
houses about 60 percent of all freshmen at the
University, the students for whom creating a
sense of community is most important in their
inaugural year in college.
Many students living on Central Campus
LEV FACHAER C

rarely go to North Campus. With such a large
portion of the student body residing in that
area, it is important to foster a more connected
community between the two campuses. By
providingspaces like the volleyball court and ice
rink, students on Central Campus may be more
tempted to make the trip. The University should
work to create more such social spaces, like
restaurants or cafes, to emulate the attractions
of Central Campus. Additionally, the University
should ensure the bus schedule runs on its
10-minute schedule to make the trip between
campuses more convenient for students.
Despite the lack of restaurants and bars, North
Campus is home to many amazing installations
that students miss out on due to the lack of
intercampus community. From the musicals
and plays at the Arthur Miller Theater to the
Stearns Collection of Musical Instruments in
the School of Music, Theater and Dance, North
Campus caters to a wide range of interests. By
encouraging intercampus communities, the
North Campus Grove project will expose more
students to these underutilized resources.
Traveling to and living on North Campus
has long been considered a hassle by students.
But these new renovations to the outdoor areas
will be a first step to ending that reputation.
The University should work to create more such
social spaces, like restaurants or cafes, to create a
truly connected community.

D etroit is the arsenal of
democracy, Motown
and the birthplace of the
mass-produced
automobile.
Detroit is also
the largest
municipality
in U.S. history
to declare
bankruptcy and
faces immense
challenges typical ALEXANDER
inkindbutunique HERMANN
in magnitude and
circumstance.
Even with years of careful analysis, at
times it's challenging justto wrap your
mind around it all.
Against this backdrop, many
narratives describing Detroit have
emerged, representing the collective
experiences, perceptions and biases of
those residingin, livingnear or merely
observing the city from afar. A smaller
subset of these narratives is granted
legitimacythrough their broadcast to a
wider audience - via the news media,
documentaries, books and more.
But no matter how many times
you repeat them, most narratives of
Detroit are complete bullshit.
Last week, a group of students,
faculty and other community
members on campus criticized a few
of these faulty constructs as part ofthe
student-led Detroit School of Urban
Studies' wrap-up session.
My personal favorite narrative?
Detroit is a "blank slate" - an
imagined ruined landscape whose
biggest asset is its emptiness. Absent
structural obstacles, the city provides
a laboratory for innovative urban
revival efforts and design practices.
These sentiments, of course, ignore
the existence of nearly 700,000
residents in the city and the fact that,
despite awell-documented population
declinesincethe1950s,Detroitstillhas
a higher population density than cities
like Denver, Atlanta, and Portland,
Ore. Kernels of truth - particularly
the notion that innovative solutions
are required here given the challenges
confronting the city - don't make the
blank-slate presupposition any less
damaging.
But other, seemingly more
innocuous, Detroit narratives can be
equally harmful.
One increasingly prevalent
perspective labels Detroit as the "tale
of two cities." In this narrative, on
one hand you have the 7.2-square mile
Greater Downtown area comprising
the Central Business District, the
arts and cultural center, Midtown,
and more. Here, you'll find Detroit's

professional sports stadiums, two of
its major hospitals, world-renowned
architecture, a disproportionately
high percentage of the city's
restaurants and nightlife, and most
of its major recent commercial and
residential successes.
The second city in this narrative is
Detroit's struggling neighborhoods
- characterized by crippling rates
of unemployment, crime, poverty,
housingvacancies, blight and a woeful
education system. Here, economic
activity is essentially reduced to
zero, and any meaningful private
investment is lacking. Contrastingthe
vibrancy and excitement surrounding
downtown, the neighborhoods are
largelyviewed as aculturalwasteland.
Though the "tale of two cities"
narrative actually acknowledges
residents' existence and, once again,
contains small tidbits of truth,
this simple dichotomy ignores the
diversity of Detroit's communities
- neighborhood to neighborhood,
block to block, and, in some places,
street to street.
I know it seems nitpicky on my part
- after all, colloquial labeling is rarely
meant to capture the complexities
inherent in the object being described.
However, as interest in Detroit grows
to its highest point in the last half
century, it's paramount, now more
than ever, to properly frame our
discussions aboutthe city.
Most importantly, however, it's the
neighborhoods that fall outside this
binary - the third, fourth and fifth
cities of Detroit - that really require
our attention.
John Gallagher's most recent
book, Revolution Detroit: Strategies
for Urban Reinvention, discusses the
benefits of "targeting" funds - federal
and state-level grants, municipal
investments and philanthropic
giving included - toward a narrower
set of "middling" neighborhoods.
According to Gallagher, such funding
is too widely dispersed among
well-off neighborhoods - those
possessing the political clout and
influence to attract investment - and
the poorest neighborhoods - those
demonstrating the greatest need but
require considerably more investment
than what's actually feasible.
If only a greater share of available
funds were allocated to communities
in the middle, then "multiplying
effects" would eventually stabilize
the housing market and, hopefully,
spur real private investment in that
community.
Make no mistake, contrary to the
dominant "two cities"' narrative,
these "middling" neighborhoods

exist across Detroit. Neighborhoods
with strong community development
organizations and local involvement,
prominent anchor institutions, and
those adjacent to stable areas are all
potential candidates for targeting.
Take the neighborhoods in
Southwest Detroit as an example.
Many of these neighborhoods saw
stabler populations between the
2000-2010 census compared to
the rest of Detroit, while smaller
neighborhoods within Southwest
Detroit - including Mexican Town
- represent one of the few places in
the city that actually saw increases
in population in that time. Due to an
influx of Hispanic immigrants, many
neighborhoods in Southwest Detroit
have few blighted homes and property
vacancies - resulting in higher
levels of commercial and residential
investment.
Farfromthevibrancyofdowntown,
Southwest Detroit doesn't fit neatly
into the "two cities" dichotomy.
Yet, it's Southwest Detroit - and
those neighborhoods like it, including
North End, the University District,
Grandmont-Rosedale and more -that
shouldbe mostvisible to thoselooking
to influence Detroit.
Realistically, despite the potential
benefits, targeting is politically
perilous. Presumably, a dollar
more given in Southwest Detroit
represents a dollar taken from another
neighborhood, like Brightmoor or
Osborn. Creating stakeholder buy-in,
then, from the major foundations, city
officials and community members
will always be a challenge. But these
efforts are feasible when you assure
all communities that abandonment
isn't an option, and then deliver clear,
honest and participatory strategies for
improvement in each neighborhood.
Ultimately, targeting, along with
other redevelopment and land-use
tacticsincludinghouse-swapandside-
lot programs, might help create the
desired pockets of population density
in areas across the city after years
of implementation. Theoretically at
least, this would allow for more cost-
effective municipal service delivery
- improved fire coverage, police
response times and trash pickup at a
cheaper rate.
I'll admit, however, that these
distant ends might be a mere pipe
dream.
Regardless, the means to a better
future, whatever it looks like, requires
us to discard the present fictions we
use to write the story of Detroit today.

I am still pro-Israel

The most important action the University's
Jewish community can take to promote peace in
the Middle East is this: an open condemnation of
Israel's far-reaching violations of human rights
inoccupiedPalestine. Itwon'tbeeasyorwithout
controversy, yet if my community is going to
stand up for what's right, it has to be done.
Instead, the rhetoric from those who oppose
the movementto divestfromcompanies inviola-
tion of human rights hasn't included enough of
that sentiment. Anti-resolution speakers' pleas
to "focus on peace" were well intentioned, yet
some shifted focus away from what's important.
Many speakers acknowledged their opposi-
tion to the occupation, and to Israel's wrong-
doings. They expressed their desire for
engagement, and should be commended.
At the same time, there's a bottom line that
wasn't addressed. This University's Jewish
community supports human rights, supports a
two-state solution, and opposes much of Israel's
role in the conflict. Why can't it more openly
and collectively take a stand against human
rights abuses, regardless of the context and how
difficult the words are to muster?
Too often, polarizing phrases like "pro-
Israel" interfere with people's ability to express
their true feelings. The tone within the Jewish
community seems to be that publicly expressing
issues with unethical actions Israel takes on a
regular basis makes one "anti-Israel," the only
logical alternative to "pro."
I ampro-Israel, inthatIsupportthe existence
of a democratic state that will always be a safe
haven for the Jewish people. To say that.I am not
pro-Israel because I condemn a human rights
violation is troubling. I am pro-Palestine, as are
all of my peers - we support the peaceful coexis-
tence of two states whose peoples live freely.
Yet some of the Jewish community banded
together to oppose a resolution that encouraged
the divestment of University money from
companies including Heidelberg Cement, a
firm that illegally exploits natural resources
in the occupied West Bank to benefit the
Israeli economy. I don't understand why
even the most "pro-Israel" of students would
want our University's money anywhere near
Heidelberg Cement.
In private, blind support of Israel is hardly
the norm. In my experience, the vast majority of
the Jewish community opposes new settlements
in the occupied territories and would certainly
oppose practices like those of Heidelberg
Cement and Caterpillar, a corporation whose
equipment is used to bulldoze Palestinian homes
to make way for those settlements.
Things change in public. The perception that
allowing the larger campus community to hear
one's disgust for unjust Israeli practices means
that one is not "supporting Israel" is alive and
well.

If "supporting Israel" means I can't tell the
world how much Israel's colonialism pains me,
count me out. That Israel "needs our support"
doesn't matter. Regardless of the circumstance,
wrong is wrong. I don't believe that stating my
opposition to new Israeli settlements or exces-
sive force used by the Israeli military makes me
anti-Israel. My issues with the tax incentives
Israel offers its citizens for moving into those
settlements are rooted only in love for a country
that claims to serve as mypeople's homeland.
SotI found it painful when my Facebook wall,
the night before the BDS resolution came before
CSG, was flooded with statements from Jewish
peers claiming that while they support peace
and support all narratives, the resolution sup-
ported neither, and therefore they'd oppose it.
Saying that you support all narratives when
those narratives inherently conflict reduces
your statement to letters on a page, nothing
more. Saying that you support positive change
while you oppose divestment from Heidelberg
Cement, a company that operates quarries in the
West Bank whose profits benefit only the Israeli
economy - textbook colonialism - does not
make sense to me.
The refrain that "BDS is divisive" gained
no traction in my mind, either. Many cited
the resolution's divisiveness as a reason they
couldn't support it, yet the resolution was only
divisive because they didn't support it in the first
place. The fact that you oppose something is not
grounds for further opposition,
This University divested from tobacco
companies in 2000. While harmful, smoking
cigarettes isn't comparable to a government
and a group of companies violating basic moral
principles. If we can divest from cigarettes, we
can divest from the occupation.
The mentality that supporting Israel entails
never publicly opposing any of its actions or
policies is what's divisive, and only polarizes
the Jewish community between those willing
to speak out and those nottcomfortable doing so.
I'm not saying that I wish the BDS resolution
had passed. There are more productive, more
holistic and more inclusive ways to promote
peace. Arguments about its one-sidedness were
reasonable and the Students Allied for Freedom
and Equality did a poor job encouraging
meaningful dialogue.
I do wish that more of the people opposing it
had used language that respected Israel's role in
the conflict instead of reducing the resolution
to a battle between those for Israel and those
against it. It's time the Jewish community pub-
licly stands up to injustice in its homeland so that
students' self-professed desire for peace doesn't
seem like such an empty statement.

In the kitchens of local haunts,
accents fly with broken wings over
surfaces of plates dirty with Cholula
hot sauce. Tie-dye t-shirts with the
spit of different berries and bleaches

clothe our greatest cities: De Moines,
Paris, Texas, Palo Alto. What is a
gabardine suit? Do they sell them at
Marshalls? Hot Topic haunts twenty-
somethings' closets, providing tube
tops that leave midriffs open to the
setting sun and proclaim its wearers
are "Daddy's Little Nightmare."
Michigan seems like a dream
to me now. Out the rear window
of a dirty house filled with the
sweat of men, I see its trees: tall,
ghostly, nature's dinosaurs. When
rain soaks through the soil it is
surprised to find that roots and
branches are mirror images of one
another with only one degree of
difference; reflections on blurry
puddles of mud. Looking out the
back seat glass I see fields fly by
and turn into blurry moonscapes
of soy and crushed cans. I love this
place, I never want to leave. I want
it to keep turning me on myself,
selling me a troubling mystery I can
never crack, not even with the help
of Detective Stabler or the Hardy
Boys. I like it better that way, I like
the assuredness of the daily news
that features failing celebrity skin
and the clash of civilizations in the
same breath. I like not knowing
who I am or where I need to be.
Let us be lovers, we'll marry
our fortunes together. I have only
the anticipation of heartbreak and
a quick rush of dopamine to give
you. We'll escape the wedding and
jump on a passing bus. Our ecstasy
will become numbing. We'll think
they've turned the camera off.
Our smiles will fade. We'll stare in
different directions.
I'll say, "I'm lost," though I know
you can't hear me.

Tiya Miles, chair of the Department of
Afro-American and African Studies, was
the faculty speaker at the event. Miles
discussed the importance of awareness
and preserving history.
She said recovering the history of
oppressed groups was difficult because
manyofthese groups relied onoral histo-
ries, were unable to write in English due
to limited access to education and were
often disregarded by official records.
"Although the histories of subjugated
groups are difficult to piece together,
it is a task that we must take up, calling
that we must answer," Miles said. "For
knowing history is a necessary aspect of
our lives. History shapes our identities as
individuals, as communities and as mem-
bers of a vast global society."
Lester Monts, senior vice provost for
academic affairs, was the Gala's keynote
speaker, recognized the work done by the
BSU in the BBUM movement.
"You (the BSU) have really moved an

In day before marathon, thousands
gather in Boston in preparation

Divers unable to
immediately idenitfy
victims of suken South
Korean ferry
JINDO, South Korea (AP) - There
are no names listed as relatives huddle
around signboards to identify bodies
from a sunken ferry. Just the slimmest of
clues about mostly young lives now lost.
Many favored hoodies and track pants.
One girl painted her fingernails red and
toenailsblack. Another had braces on her
teeth.
As divers increasingly making their
way into the ship, including a new entry-
way through the dining hall Monday,
there's been a big jump inthe discovery of
corpses. And so more grim work for rela-
tives gathered on Jindo, an island near
the ferry. Until recently, they have been
waiting and hoping that round-the-clock
rescue operations would find survivors.
Meanwhile, a newly released tran-
script shows the ship was crippled by
confusion and indecision well after it
began listing Wednesday. The transcript
suggests that the chaos may have added
to a death toll that could eventually
exceed 300.
Many people followed the captain's
initial order to stay below deck, where it
is feared they remain trapped. Sixty-four
bodies have been recovered, and about
240 people are still missing. The ferry
sank with 476 people on board, many of
them students from a single high school.
According to the transcript released
by South Korea's coast guard, about 30
minutes after the Sewol began tilting

a crew member asked a marine traffic
controller whether passengers would be
rescued if they abandoned ship off South
Korea's -southern coast. The crew mem-
ber posed the question three times in
succession.
That followedseveral statements from
the ship that people aboard could not
move and another in which someone
said that it was "impossible to broadcast"
instructions.
An unidentified official at Jindo Ves-
sel Traffic Services Center told the crew
that they should "go out and let the pas-
sengers wear life jackets and put on more
clothing."
"If this ferry evacuates passengers,
will you be able to rescue them?" the
unidentified crew member asked.
"At least make them wear life rings
and make them escape!" the traffic-cen-
ter official responded.
"If this ferry evacuates passengers,
will they be rescued right away?" the
crew member asked again.
"Don't let them go bare - at least
make them wear life rings and make
them escape," the traffic official repeat-
ed. "The rescue of human lives from the
Sewol ferry ... the captain should make
his own decision and evacuate them.
We don't know the situation very well.
The captain should make the final deci-
sion and decide whether you're going to
evacuate passengers or not."
"I'm not talking about that," the crew
member said. "I asked - if they evacuate
now, can they be rescued right away?"
The traffic official then said patrol
boats would arrive in 10 minutes, though
another civilian ship was already nearby
and had told controllers that it would res-
cue anyone who went overboard.

Second-largest field in
history of the event to
compete in marathon
BOSTON (AP) - In many ways, it felt
like any other pre-marathon Sunday in
Boston.
Families celebrated Easter, diners
enjoyed the spring weather at sidewalk
cafes, and runners - easily identified by
their trim builds and colorful jackets -
picked up last-minute supplies for what
will be the second-largest field in the his-
tory of the Boston Marathon.

But even as runners focused on the
exhilaration ofcrossingthe finishline, the
festive atmosphere was inevitably tinged
with sorrow, as runners, family members
and spectators recalled the twin bomb-
ings at last year's race that killed three
people and injured 260.
Marathon runners were blessed at an
emotional church service that celebrated
Easter and remembered thevictims, while
heightened security measures, including
bag checks, were in place at marathon
events.
"It's different, comingback,"saidGisele
Goldstein, 55, of Germantown, Tenn., who
planned to run her 12th Boston Marathon

this year. "It's not just me-there's a sad-
ness."
At City Hall, a fast-moving line of sev-
eral hundred runners and their families
stretched around the building, where race
organizers served a pre-race pasta dinner.
"So many of us are running this year
because of that day," said Justin Jackson,
32, of Chicago.
Preparing for Monday's race has been
emotional, he said. While it had not ini-
tially occurred to him to be nervous about
another terrorist attack, a bomb scare on
Tuesday night "regenerated the worry
that there might be crazy people out
there."

Wally Pfister talks
'Transcendence'

'Dark Knight'
cinematographer
discusses his
directorial debut
By CONRAD FOREMAN
DailyArts Writer
One of the things "Gravity"
did was remind audiences of the
significance of the cinematog-
rapher. As the (wo)man behind
the camera, the cinematogra-
pher is integral in shaping the
style and feel of the film. It's
not surprising, therefore, that
many cinematographers go on
to become directors.
One such cinematographer
to make this transition is Wally
Pfister ("The Dark Knight").
His directorial debut, "Tran-
scendence," hit theaters April
18. Pfister spoke about his new
film and his step into the direc-
tor's chair in a conference call
with The Michigan Daily.
"For me, the greatest chal-
lenge was also one of the most
enlightening, wonderful, fun
things, which was in directing
actors and delving in the per-
formances for the first time,"
Pfister said.
It's fair to say Pfister had
a plentiful crop of capable
performers on his team. The
cast includes Johnny Depp
("Edward Scissorhands"), Mor-
gan Freeman ("The Shawshank

Redemption"), Rebecca Hall
("The Prestige") and Paul Bet-
tany ("A Beautiful Mind").
"It's mind-blowing. Really,
I felt incredibly fortunate to
be lucky enough among outing
as a director to have the likes
of these incredible actors. And
honestly, this isn't just bullshit:
they were all a joy to work
with."
Pfister said that his previ-
ous working relationships with
Freeman and Hall helped him
adjust to his firstgig as a direc-
tor. He worked with Freeman
on "The Dark Knight" trilogy,
and with Hall on "The Pres-
tige." Each of those movies was
directed by Christopher Nolan
("Inception"). In fact, Pfister's
done the cinematography for
every one of Nolan's films since
"Memento," in 2000.
"Chris and I worked together
for a long time and clearly for a
reason," Pfister said. "We both
had a great respect for each
other and had a good working
relationship, and I think we did
some fantastic work together."
Pfister talked about how
Nolan's example helped him
take on a greater leadership
role.
"One of the great things
about Chris Nolan is his disci-
pline on the set, and to observe
somebody who really considers
every minute of your set time to
be precious," Pfister said.
"Transcendence" follows a
common science fiction theme

of artificial intelligence. How-
ever, as Pfister explains, "Tran-
scendence" manages to set itself
apart.
"We are talking about an
actual human consciousness
living in this machine rather
than something completely
artificial, so that makes it
slightly different, and I think
that also sets off the emo-
tional journey," Pfister said.
"Throughout most of the movie,
the idea is to question whether-
in fact this machine contains
the actual soul of this particu-
lar person - that person being
Johnny, of course."
Pfister knows that these
issues have complex implica-
tions, so he did his due dili-
gence in research. In addition
to research visits to MIT and
Stanford University, Pfister
collaborated with two profes-
sors'at University of California,
Berkeley to better understand
the topics.
"They were so helpful," Pfis-
ter said. "They became the kind
of fulltime consultants on the
film and were involved in sort
of every stage of vetting the sci-
ence and the medical applica-
tions in the film."
Only time will tell if the
advanced technology of "Tran-
scendence" will permeate real
life.
"It's anybody's guess what
would happen," Pfister said.
"I don't really have a desire to
upload my brains."

A 1 JM IL is corrupt and a murderer?
Apparently for Olivia Pope
the answer is to quit OPA
and hop on a private jet and
run away. After all, Olivia's
close friend Cyrus was will-

ing to let a church explode
with hundreds of people
inside just to win an elec-
tion, which somehow wasn't
even the most shocking and
important part of this finale.
Her father is a murderer, and
her mother and her boyfriend
and her other boyfriend and
the people she works with,
the list goes on and on. Olivia
Pope, the woman who refuses
to quit and can supposedly
handle anything has run away
from all her problems. But
don't worry, she brought Jake
with her to "stand in the sun,"
because a person actually can
stand in the sun with some-
one who took over as com-
mand of B613 and personally
murdered James Novak and
two other people. No, there's
no dark shadow following him
around. On the bright side
though, at least Olivia finally
made a decision.
Jake or Fitz? Jake or Fitz?
All season long Olivia has
gone back and forth dragging
viewers along with her. She
sits on the phone with Jake,
then she has a little rendez-
vous with Fitz in the Oval
Office. Neither relationship is
really healthy, but at least she
has finally picked someone.
And being that Jake is neither
married nor the president
of the United States, he does
seem like the more appropri-
ate and logical choice.
Olivia was once so strong,
she stood tall in her white
hat, a gladiator in a suit and
gorgeous jackets, sure of her-
self and her mission. She was
there to fix things, but while
she was busy fixing everyone
else's problems, hers built
up and now Olivia can't even
handle her own life. She's the
one who needs fixing.
If the series is renewed
for another season, which in
all likeliness it will be, it'll
be interesting to see where
Rhimes takes this story.
Olivia can't run away forever,
she'll be back. Getting on a
plane and fleeing from all of
her issues and everyone she
knows will not help her stand
in the sun. In order for Olivia
to ever be able to find peace,
she will need to pull everyone
else out of the darkness and
expose them, and since every-
one she knows seems to be
covered in darkness, it's clear
she has a lot of work to do.

'Orphan Black' succeeds

RADIUS-TWC
Don tha don.
Necessary bias in
Errol Morris film

By CHLOE GILKE
Daily Arts Writer
Theseasonpremiereof"Orphan
Black" begins with an English lady
sitting down for a nice cup of tea -
but don't get too
comfortable just
yet.
Above all, Orphan
"Orphan Black" Black
is notorious for
two things: 1) Season
its lead actress's Premiere
brilliant perfor- Saturdays
mance (perfor- at 9 p.m.
mances?) as a
legion of eccen- BBCAmerica
tric clones and
2) that relentlessly action-packed
pace. When Sarah Manning rush-
es breathlessly into a diner and
orders a cup of tea, you know it's
probably goingto end with a shoot-
out.
"Orphan Black" is an unpredict-
able amalgam of genres, managing
to simultaneously be acop drama,
a Shakespearean tragedy, a crime
caper and an involved (and often
confusing) sci-fi mystery. Take
all these wildly varying plot-
lines and factor in the breakneck
speed of the plot, and you've got
a show pretty much destined to
be a hot mess. These elements
certainly shouldn't work so well
together, but the variations have
the same DNA (we're sticking
with the clone metaphor here)
and somehow create a cohesive
whole that defies all science and
logic. "Orphan Black" juggles
its sci-fi and personal drama
with sophistication and panache
thanks to one unifying element -
the wonderful Tatiana Maslany.
Maslany ("The Vow") follows
up on last season's outstanding
performance, and treats viewers
to five incredibly detailed and
unique characters in this episode
alone. Watching her, it's easy to
forget that it's only one actress
playing these roles. Maslany uses
every trick in her toolkit, employ-

Documentarian takes
on Donald Rumsfeld
in'The Unknown

By CONRAD FOREMAN
Daily Arts Writer
There are known knowns (the
things we know we know). There

we know we
don't know). /
And there
are unknown e
unknowns (the Unknown
things we don't
know we don't Known
know).
"The Michigan
Unknown Theater
Known," the RADiUS-TWC
latest film from
documentar-
ian Errol Morris ("The Thin Blue
Line"), seeks to uncover these
unknown unknowns (the title
references a typo made by for-
mer United States Secretary of
Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, in a
memo he sent during his tenure).
The film revolves around inter-
view sessions with Morris and
Rumsfeld, and takes a closer look
at the personal and professional
lives of one of the most influential
people in American politics over
the last 40 years.
The film covers a vast assort-
ment of topics - Vietnam, Nixon,
Ford, Reagan, Bush One, Bush
Two, Iraq and others - and
assumes its audience has a consid-
erable amount of foreknowledge
of these topics. What stands out
most, though, is Rumsfeld himself
- his character and personality
(and the fact that the only lesson
he takes away from the Vietnam
War is that "some thingswork out,
and some things don't").
There's one point during the
interviews where Rumsfeld refers

to former Deputy Prime Minis-
ter of Iraq, Tariq Aziz. Rumsfeld
incredulously explains how Aziz
seems to be a completely normal,
rational, logical person; he can't
understand why Aziz supported a
malicious regime. Morris lets that
sentiment simmer for a moment..
The point is obvious: Throughout
the interview, Rumsfeld shows
himself to be an intelligent, ratio-
nal, friendly person - so why did
he make the decisions he made?
Why did he play a critical role ina
violent invasion based on false pre-
tenses, which led to the deaths of at
least a hundred thousand people?
The answer is in Rumsfeld's
own psyche, where you'll find not
an explanation or justification, but
rather a void, an apparent lack of
empathy for the innocent. At one
point, Rumsfeld recalls a failed
assassination attempt against Sad-
dam Hussein (this comes imme-
diately after he declares that the
United States does not assassinate
other world leaders). He recounts
how they initially believed one of
the bodies to be Hussein; as Rums-
feld clarifies that it in fact was not,
he cracks a smile and begins to
chuckle.
These characteristics, which
are at best disturbing and at worst
psychopathic, complement a bar-
rage of falsehoods that Rumsfeld
presents to the audience. While
Morris exposes these contradic-
tions in his film, the purported lies
Rumsfeld told the American public
leading up to and during the Iraq
War were much harder to regulate.
As Rumsfeld states multiple
times in the film, "The absence
of evidence is not evidence of
absence." This is essentially his
rationale for the second Bush
administration's steadfast com-
mitment to the position that Iraq
had weapons of mass destruction
in 2003, despite no hard evidence
supporting this claim.
One thingcan't be denied about
Rumsfeld: He's a master of lan-
guage. He understands that the

Prince has been hiding out in the cast of "Orphan Black."

discourse about atopic is absolute-
ly vital to public perception and to
what people will view as appro-
priate action. Morris emphasizes
this, frequently placing Rumsfeld's
words on screen, along with their
dictionary definitions.
Though the chronicle of Rums-
feld's almost unbelievable career is
the meat of the film, Morris's cre-
ative contributions, which serve as
a delightful seasoning, shouldn't
be overlooked. Much of the con-
tent of "The Unknown Known" is
derived from memos that Rums-
feld sent during his time in office;
in a move that would make any
postmodernist proud, Morris
often places these memos under
the microscope of the camera
lens.
The film incorporates breath-
taking bird's-eye shots of the infi-
nite ocean and of a paradoxically
beautiful swamp. He wasn't alone
in the artistic creation of the film,
of course. Composer Danny Elf-
man ("Corpse Bride") provides
a haunting score, without which
the film wouldn't leave its unique
impression as both a documen-
tary and a horror film.
"The Unknown Known" is
thought-provoking, biased, rel-
evant and entertaining - a doc-
umentary of the highest order.
Its bias shows itself in Morris's
interviewing style, which places
himself as judge during the inter-
viewee's trial, but Rumsfeld knew
this would be the case before
he agreed to the interviews. It's
therefore shocking - for a man
whose every move is cunning
and calculated - that Rumsfeld
agreed to a film that casts him in
such a negative light.
"The Unknown Known" may
not reveal every dirty little secret
of Rumsfeld's politics, but it does
its best to expose those unknown
unknowns - what we didn't know
we didn't know. The questions that
remain then are, what do we want
to know, and what do we deserve
to know?

movements, accents (for a non-
Englishwoman, her variations in
British dialects are spectacular)
and truly transforms into each of
the clones. She is a believable les-
bian scientist, frustrated mother,
evil executive and mad woman
on the run, and even as the action
races on, she remains consistent-
ly grounded and engaging.
But while Maslany is great,
"Orphan Black" continues to
face the same problems that
plagued its first season. The sup-
porting characters that Maslany
does not play are still just as one-
dimensional and dull as ever. Some
(Beth's former lover Paul) are
probably beyond saving, but oth-
ers (like Cosima's girlfriend Del-
phine) could benefit from a little
more character development. It's
hard to be attached to characters
when they seem to exist solely as
pawns for the clone characters,
but if Felix (the fantastic Jordan
Gavaris, "Unnatural History") is
any indication, "Orphan Black" is
certainly capable of creating inter-
esting and relevant characters that
aren't played by Maslany.
Another problem is born from
oneoftheshowsgreateststrengths
- the pacing. Sure,"Orphan Black"
is exciting and fun to watch, but
during this episode, I found myself
craving the slower moments that
characterized some of the ear-
lier episodes of season one. (One
favorite: Allison singing along to
"Bitch" by Meredith Brooks in her
car, which seems insignificant but

somehow tells so much about who
she is as a person). When Sarah sat
down for tea in the beginning of
the episode, a part of me cheered,
hoping she'd take a few moments
to digest the news of her daugh-
ter being kidnapped and come up
with a plan. But "Orphan Black"
doesn't take time for plans - like
Sarah, it's always on the run. Two
minutes later, Sarah is smashing a
wall with a fire extinguisher. By
the end of the episode she's sneak-
ing into a banquet with Delphine,
dressed in Cosima's dreads and a
California accent. As awesome as
this kinetic energy is, it would be
nice to pause once in a while and
give viewers a chance to catch
up with the characters and the
show's complex mysteries.
Still, judging by this first epi-
sode, the upcoming season of
"Orphan Black" will be engaging
and madcap fun. The whirlwind
nature of the show means that it
is always fresh and surprising, and
the twists and turns of this epi-
sode only anticipate more of that to
come. Though Cosima's sickness is
barely touched upon in the pre-
miere, it's aticking time bomb that
could lead into the introduction
of a new clone character (a can-
cer patient named Jennifer who
is expected to debut in the coming
weeks) and yet another opportuni-
ty for Maslany to show off her act-
ing chops. Though the big picture
elements may be slow to develop,
it's worth the twisty and nonstop
action to get to the payoff.

Michigan rebounds
from Friday loss,
takes two of three
against Minnesota
By KELLY HALL

Freshman right-hander Megan

rubber match MICHIGAN 0

Minnesota. MINNESOTA 1
Despite MICHIGAN 3

older pitchers MINESOTA

experience
against the Golden Gophers,
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
made her decision to start the
freshman Saturday night after

Minnesota evened the series.
Betsa's confidence was on display
throughout all seven innings. She
allowed just two hits - both solo
homers - to lead her team to a 7-2
victory over Minnesota. Betsa got
some help in the fifth when senior
first baseman Caitlin Blanchard
followed the intentional walk of
Romero with a three-run double and
Sweet hit a three-run homer. Betsa's
11 strikeouts were just as essential.
"I thinktI've beencthrowingpretty
well lately, and for (Hutchins) to just
throw me out there gave me high
confidence in myself," Betsa said. "I
knew they had confidence in me, so
I was kind of expecting (to start)."
All year, Michigan has scored
runs in bunches. The pattern held
when junior catcher Lauren Sweet
followed up Blanchard's hit with
a three-run homer. Nine hitters
came to bat in the bottom of the
fifth to score six runs. The game
was all butover for Minnesota(11-5
Big Ten, 33-8 overall).

But Betsa didn't have thatArun
support to start off the game. After
two scoreless innings for both
teams, sophomore shortstop Sierra
Romero lined a home run to dead
center field. The Wolverines (14-
1, 36-7) had a chance to boost the
lead when Blanchard followed with
a double over left fielder Sydney
Fabian's head, but the inning
abruptly ended when Fabian stole
a hit from sophomore left fielder
Sierra Lawrence with a diving catch.
After an uneventful fourth, Betsa
struck out the first two batters in
the top of the fifth, but then No. 9
hitter Sam Macken surprised the
Wolverines with a solo homer. The
inning closed when Blanchard
stretched for the throw from
Romero to get the runner out at first.
Michigan responded to the run
with intensity. After freshman
second baseman Abby Ramirez

in the top of the fifth inning
Sunday, Michigan softball
pitcher Megan Betsa headed
back to the circle after her pitch
sailed just outside the strike
zone. The count was now full,
but there seemed little reason to
be fazed - the freshman righty
had already struck out the first
two batters and had carried the
fifth-ranked Wolverines all day
to that point.
Minnesota's Sam Macken sent
the next pitch 30 feet into the
stands in right field, tying up the
game at one apiece.
Macken's hit was exactly
the type of thing that would've
rattled Betsa earlier in the
season, but the freshman battled
back this time in a 7-2 victory.
It wasn't easy, either. Betsa,
who tossed 10 strikeouts in
five innings and had a no hitter
going before the Macken homer,
surrendered another home
run to begin the sixth. The

Saturday MICHIGAN 13
in West
Lafayette, the Wolverines' bats
froze and their shaky defense
was exploited, but they came into
the final game of the series firing
on all cylinders to claim another
Big Ten weekend. ,
Michigan (8-7 Big Ten, 18-21-1
overall) jumped out to a six-run
lead in the first three innings
Sunday and never looked back.
The Wolverines rallied behind a
seven-inning outing from senior
left-hander Logan McAnallen,
who allowed just four hits and
struck out three.
"Winning a series on the
road is a tough thing to do,"
said Michigan coach Erik
Bakich. "At the same time, we
expect to win every series that
we play, whether it's at home or
on the road."
Despite the loss the night
before, Michigan let the memory
of defeat slip its mind and came
out swinging with confidence
in the 17-hit game, its second-
highest of the season.
In the first inning, the
Wolverines' first eight batters

had quality at-bats and never
faced a two-strike count.
Sophomore shortstop Travis
Maezes led off with a double
to left field, and Michigan then
batted around.
"The first inning couldn't
have gone any better," Bakich
said. "We needed to come out
and deliver a pretty good punch
right from the start."
Twice in the Wolverines' last
six games, Michigan has forced
the starting pitcher out of the
game in the first inning. Purdue
right-hander Brett Haan threw
just 26 pitches and gave up
three runs before being pulled
- Hann was replaced before the
ninth batter.
"We didn't want to wait
around and feel the game out,"
Maezes said. "We wanted to be
the aggressor and get the bats
going early."
The Wolverines continued to
be dominant, scoring twice in the
second inning off hot, top-of-the-
order batting, and adding another
tally in the third, forcing the
Boilermakers (4-8, 9-26) to reach
even deeper into their bullpen -
in the sixth inning, they made
three changes on the mound.
According to Bakich,
McAnallen wasn't pitching as
sharply as he could've in the first
three innings - he walked two
of the first five batters - but he
improved late in the game. He
didn't allow Purdue's first run
until the sixth inning, but that
didn't faze him as he pounded
the zone for two more innings.
"He was able to just squash

any momentum they had,"
Bakich said. "We played solid
defense behind him and put
ourselves in a position for our
offense to relax and continue to
extend the lead."
The Wolverines remained
relentless at the plate in the
seventh inning to score five more
runs while batting through the
order for the second time.
Though it took three
Michigan pitchers to provide
relief after McAnallen, the
Wolverines' explosive offense
throughout the game provided
a thick enough cushion to pull
ahead of .500 in the conference.
"We're going to need to
continue at a very high and
consistent level," Bakich said.
"We're also going to need
some help with some other
teams scuffling."
Whathappened Friday:
Looking to continue their Big
Ten momentum after taking
two of three in Champaign,
the Wolverines made a strong
entrance into Friday's series
opener, but it took 12 innings,
their longest of the season, to
pull off a 7-6 win over Purdue.
Tied at six in the 12th,
freshman designated hitter
Carmen Benedetti doubled
down the right-field line to score
the go-ahead run.
What happened Saturday:
The Boilermakers' bats
bullied the Michigan defense
and exploited two errors en
route to a 6-2 decision, ending
the Wolverines' three-game
conference win streak.

First half dooms 'M'

By AZALEA HINOJOSA
Daily Sports Writer
Coming off a pair of wins
over California and Detroit,
the Michigan women's lacrosse
team was prepared to take on
Vanderbilt Saturday. But to its
dismaythegamedevelopedmuch
the same
way it had MICHIGAN 9
in previous VANDERBILT 16
ALC
competitions. That is, the
Wolverines were forced to play
frombehind.
But it didn't start that way.
Just 54 seconds in, freshman
attacker Tess Korten raced
downfield, cradling the ball
closely and ducking stick checks
from the Commodores' defense.
A few passes later, along the
eight-meter mark, freshman
midfielder Anna Schueler drove
straight for the goal and notched
the first point of the game.
At home, Michigan (0-6,
3-12 overall) dominated early
on, forcing turnovers and

outshooting its opponent at
the net. But a quick change in
Vanderbilt's defensive game
plan caused panic among the
Wolverines and it answered the
fast break with not one or two
goals,buteight.TheCommodores
(2-4,5-il) went onto win, 16-9.
"Coming out was a little
difficult," said freshman
midfielder Kim Coughlan. "We
were a little startled by their
defense, but by the second
half, we had more confidence
and we learned how their
defense worked."
It wasn't until the last few
minutes of the first half that the
Wolverines notched their second
goal, this time from freshman
attacker Jess Angerman. At the
break, Vanderbilt led 9-2.
By then, the Wolverines knew
coming back from such a deficit
vwould be a struggle - a struggle
that has been all too common for
the team of freshmen.
"At halftime, I just focused
them on the plan," said Michigan
coach Jennifer Ulehla. "I told

them they needed to believe that
they can get out there and make
a difference and just goal by goal
try to get back into this game.
I thought they did a great job at
doingthat."
The second half saw a
transformed Michigan team.
Freshman midfielder
Madeline Dion began on the
right note, netting a goal for the
Wolverines less than a minute
in. Schueler and Coughlan were
responsible for the next five
tallies - the first two whipped in
back-to-back by Schueler. With
three goals, Coughlan recorded
her second straight hat trick.
Angerman was the last
Wolverine to tally a point, doing
so just asthe game cameto aclose.
But the Commodores continued
to attack and added on to their
already insuperable lead, scoring
in between Michigan goals - the
last of theirs was marked with
eight seconds remaining.
Michigan matched
Vanderbilt's power and agility
in the second half, where both
teams recorded seven points.
That was the team that stuck
to the plan. That was the team
that the first half missed.
"It takes 60 minutes to win a
game," Ulehla said. "Today, we
played 30.
"We came back in a sense that
we really got ourselves back in
the game, in the hunt. But when
you go down seven goals against
a program like that, you can
work to get close, but it's going
to be tough, with all freshmen, to
really pull that out. We needed to
play more than a second half."
The growth that Ulehla sees in
her young team on a daily basis
has become evident. A team that
has once trailed by more than
10 points against conference
opponents cut the lead down to
seven in its weekend matchup.
Confidence is key, and 'Team
One' knows it.

into Sunday's event finals, but
also marked her first NCAA All-

"This year reminds me a lot of
lastyear's bar rotation," Sampson
said. "It's just one of those things
that minimizes the number of
tenths we're giving away, and
that's exactly what we needed to
start off by doing."
But after counting a fall on
the balance beam, Michigan
was unable to bounce back.

"Balance beam is the great

Michigan coach Bev Plocki.

The meet wasn't over, and
anything could happen.
The team put itself in a
situation to break into the top
three in case any teams opened
doors with mistakes of their own.
"We were going to do whatever
we could in our power to fight
for the finish, and I think we did
exactly that," Sampson said. "I
don't think we could've finished
any better than we did."
On the floor exercise,
Michigan rebounded and put the
disappointing beam performance
behind. Like bars, each gymnast
in the lineup scored at least 9.800.
Both Artz and Sampson
received their second NCAA All-
American honors of the season
on floor after scoring 9.900 and
9.950, respectively.
Sampson, who tied for first in
the session, had the chance to
defend her event title in Sunday's
individual event finals.
"Hopefully, I'll just do the

Sampson said. "This was

exciting knowing that I have one
more opportunity to put on that
Michigan leotard and represent
the block 'M' the best way I
know how."
In their final rotation, the
Wolverines closed out their
season on a high note. Plocki
commended the performance
as one of the team's best all
season, a remarkable compliment
considering the team lost
sophomore Austin Sheppard, the
second-best vaulter in the nation,
due to an untimely ankle injury.
As she did on bars and
floor, junior Sachi Sugiyama
got the ball rolling from the
leadoff position.
"At firstIwas alittle surprised
(about going first), but I got more
comfortable as the season went
on and now I love it," Sugiyama
said. "I love how the coaches have
so much faith in me and trust me
to hit a good routine every time."
Sugiyama stuck her Yurchenko
1.5 vault cold, scoring 9.900 and
earning herself a place in the
vault finals.
"I knew we really had to come
back and have the best vault
rotation of our lives," Sugiyama
said. "It was no doubt the best
vault of my life."
Especially on vault, the way
the first gymnast in the lineup
performs often has a snowball
effect. Indeed, that is precisely
what happened after the freshly
minted All-American completed
her vault.
Artz, senior Reema Zakharia
and freshman Talia Chiarelli
immediately followed Sugiyama
with stuck landings. The
freshman duo each scored 9.850,
which marked a career high
for Artz and tied a season-best
for Chiarelli.
Michigan's all-around
competitors, Sampson and Artz,
earned All-American status after
finishing first (39.550) and third
(39.375) in the semifinal.
