Jewish Family Services of 

Washtenaw County expects to 
have resettled about 163 refugees 
in the county by the conclusion 
of its fiscal year this fall, nearly 
doubling 
its 
previous 
year’s 

caseload, and plans to do so again 
in the coming year.

In a March interview with 

the Daily, JFS administrators 
said their resettlement target 
was still in the 80-person range. 
However, 
an 
uptick 
in 
the 

number of refugees the Obama 
administration chose admit this 
year — from an initial goal of 
10,000 to 12,000 — led to a surge 
in demand for JFS’s services 
around May and June. These 
new arrivals will primarily be 
from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, 
Ethiopia, Somalia and Iran.

In an interview this week, 

Shrina Eadeh, JFS’s director 
of 
resettlement, 
said 
her 

organization plans to hire two 
new resettlement caseworkers 
in 
addition 
to 
its 
three 

current resettlement staff to 
accommodate the new demand. 
JFS has also received additional 
federal funding to meet the influx 
of new clients, as the organization 

The University of Michigan 

hosted an event Thursday to 
discuss the lasting impact of a 
June 12 mass shooting at Pulse, 
a gay nightclub in Florida where 
nearly 50 people were killed, on 
the Latino community.

The event began with a 

moment of silence for victims, 
before moving to a series of 
speakers.

Ramón 
Rivera-Servera, 

associate professor and chair of 
the Department of Performance 
Studies 
at 
Northwestern 

University, spoke at the forum, 
highlighting 
his 
personal 

experience as a queer Puerto 
Rican.

Rivera-Servera said hatred 

toward 
LGBTQ, 
Latino 

individuals can be seen not only 
through incidents such as the 
shooting, but also through what 
he called the “whitewashing” 
of media narratives, or the 
insertion of a white perspective 
in news reports. He noted that 
his research on queer Latino 

nightlife has suggested this is an 
issue in that space in particular.

“Latinos have always, in 

a way, been present in this 
nightlife history of the LBGTQ 
community, but their presence 

is often being marginalized 
in our rendition of national 
history,” Rivera-Servera said. 
“This attack is a really extreme 
manifestation of the kind of 
violence and hate and phobias 

that characterize the broader 
experience of risk.”

A new policy to tax disposable 

bags 
in 
Washtenaw 
County 

may be stymied by the state 
legislature before it goes into 
effect, depending on the outcome 
of a vote in the state House this 
week.

On June 1, the Washtenaw 

County Board of Commissioners 
voted 6-2 in favor of a law to 
institute a 10-cent tax for every 
disposable bag a consumer uses 
at retail grocery stores, effective 
April 22, 2017. The legislation 
was approved by a House panel 
on Tuesday, allowing it to move 
to the House for a vote.

tax” from being passed and

Though the question has been 

a 
persistent 
one 
throughout 

its history, over the past year 
the University of Michigan has 
focused in on how to become more 
diverse, more inclusive and more 
welcoming under a University 
initiative to create a campus-wide 
strategic plan for diversity.

On Oct. 6, that answer is 

supposed to become clearer, when 
the University formally launches 

its campus-wide Diversity, Equity 
& Inclusion plan, a year-long effort 
started by University President 
Mark Schlissel. However, after 
the discovery of racially charged 
fliers in University buildings 
and a controversial debate over 
the merits of Black Lives Matter 
earlier 
this 
week 
prompted 

massive student protests, new 
questions about issues of race on 
campus and tensions between 
the University and students have 
surfaced. Though both the debate 
and the posters have been a focus, 
many students have also pointed 

to systemic issues of climate they 
said those incidents highlighted 
— criticizing what they described 
as years of University inaction 
and citing the strategic plan as an 
example.

LSA freshman Na’kia Channey, 

who spoke at the protest Tuesday 
night, said there was a lack of 
trust between Black students 
and the University, echoing the 
sentiments of multiple other 
students interviewed throughout 
the week.

“As 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
the 

only 
reason 
we’re 
having 

discussions now is because it was 
stimulated by those examples of 
discrimination,” Channey said. 
“I’m not sure if the University 
of Michigan is really open about 
having discussions, but I feel like 
we should not have to wait until 
an inciting incident for us to have 
these dialogues. We shouldn’t feel 
like we have to curate our space 
for our voices to be heard.”

This consistent discussion of 

larger campus issues throughout 
the week illuminates a different 
kind of question, one situated 
between student concerns and 

University efforts — why were 
two days of protests able to draw 
almost triple as many people 
total as University events themed 
around campus climate and the 
diversity plan have drawn in past 
weeks?

Until the protests began this 

week, public participation in 
discussion about the University’s 
approach to diversity on campus 
had been limited. Last week, 
multiple 
University-sanctioned 

forums were held on campus 
around campus climate, as LSA

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Engineering senior Aaron Baumgarten watches the first presidential debate 
at a viewing party hosted at the Ford School of Public Policy Monday. 

n response to the University 

of Michigan’s new class roster 
pronoun policy, some students 
have customized their pronouns 
in a manner misaligned with 
the 
policy’s 
intent, 
sparking 

controversy on social media.

The policy allows students 

to designate pronouns in a new 
Gender Identity tab within the 
Campus Personal Information 
section of Wolverine Access. 
Along with several set pronouns, 
the dropdown menu features an 
“enter your own” category.

An email sent Tuesday to 

campus students and faculty from 
University Provost Martha E. 
Pollack and E. Royster Harper, 
the vice president for student life, 
said the goal of the policy was to 
promote inclusion.

“The University of Michigan 

is committed to fostering an 
environment of inclusiveness,” 
they wrote. “Consistent with this 
value, the University has created a 
process for students to designate 
pronouns with the University and 
have those pronouns reflected on 
class rosters this fall.”

The email also said professors 

will be asked to re-check their 
class rosters at the end of October 
and use the pronouns indicated by 
students.

However, 
several 
students 

on campus have changed their 
pronouns to a variety of titles 
intended to spark ridicule of the 
policy.

LSA 
junior 
Grant 
Strobl, 

national chairman of the Young 
Americans for Freedom board 
of governors, began the criticism 
when he changed his pronoun to 
“His Majesty.”

Strobl 
announced 
this 

undertaking 
Wednesday 
via 

Twitter, encouraging others to do 
the same.

In an interview, Strobl said 

the push was Young Americans 
for 
Freedom’s 
new 
hashtag 

campaign. He said the University 
policy complicates reality and 
allows 
for 
an 
unnecessary 

ambiguity.

“The 
new 
policy 
ignores 

reality,” he said. “The purpose 
of pronouns is to simplify the 
English 
language, 
not 
add 

more complexity. The idea that 
anybody can insert an ambiguous 
title, pronoun, that isn’t a pronoun 
into the University system, and 
then professors potentially facing 
sanctions is absolutely absurd.”

Several others responded in 

support of Strobl’s challenge, 
changing their pronouns to titles 
such as ‘Her Royal Highness’.

However, many others used 

social media to condemn the 
campaign.

School 
of 
Information 

Prof. Kristin Fontichiaro sent 
an email to the Information 
School community in response 
to the campaign, citing it as an 
example of how technology is 
not always used in the way it 
was intended.

“It reminds me of how 

complicated UMSI’s people-
information-technology triad 
can be and how difficult it 
can 
be 
for 
well-intended 

leaders such as our campus 
administration to anticipate 
how a well-intended system 
can be thwarted by folks,” 
Fontichiaro wrote in the email.

She added, however, that 

she would not utilize titles as 
pronouns in her classroom.

“One final thing ... should 

any 
#umpronounchallenge 

fans be on this list, please be 
advised that I do not plan to use 
‘Your Majesty’ or ‘Professor’ 
as pronouns in my classroom,” 
she wrote. “Call me an old-
fashioned 
former 
English 

teacher, but titles are not 
pronouns.”

implemented, the Republican-
controlled State Senate passed 
a bill in May that would, if 
passed by the House, bar local 
governments from passing such 
fees on packaging containers. 
This 
legislation 
represents 

the first attempt by any local 
government in Michigan to adopt 
such an “eco-tax;” however, it 
faces great uncertainty in the 
hands of state legislatures.

The bill to prevent the passage 

of an “eco-tax,” was passed 25-12 
along almost entirely partisan 
lines. 

Commissioner Andy LaBarre 

said the “eco-tax” policy is a 
result of efforts by the board to 
protect the environment and 
reduce costs. He estimated the 
county will save approximately 
$200,000 per year after the 
policy is adopted — money 
currently spent on repairing 
recycling utilities because plastic 
bags clog the machinery.

“(The law) is designed to help 

minimize the amount of plastic 
bags you see floating about in the 
environment,” LaBarre said. “It 
is also designed to promote the 
reuse of plastic bags and paper 
bags.”

However, some commissioners 

remain opposed. Commissioner 
Dan Smith, who voted against 
the tax, noted the law was rushed 
through without going through 
the Board of Public Works and 
said it would not effectively cut 
costs.

“I’m 
the 
Board 
of 

Commissioner’s liaison to the 

Board of Public Works and there 
were 
several 
members 
that 

were rather perturbed that they 
hadn’t even had an opportunity 
to weigh in on this,” Smith said. 
“There was lots of talk made at 
the time and I saw a recent news 
article about the thing that’s 
cost Washtenaw County money. 
Well, it doesn’t cost Washtenaw 
County 
any 
money 
because 

we don’t own any recycling 
facilities.”

Smith also charged that the 

board does not have the authority 
to enact such a law.

“The mechanism that we 

came up with is convoluted at 
best,” he said. “There is actually 
two different attorney general 
opinions that call into question 
our ability to do this type of 
thing 
without 
explicit 
state 

authorization.”

Republicans 
and 
affected 

businesses have also argued 
that local taxes like this one 
create “patchwork legislation” 
that make it costlier for big, 
multinational 
franchises 
to 

adhere to all laws in every 
county.

“Any time you start to see a 

patchwork approach … it creates 
another level of complexity 
that we just don’t necessarily 
think 
is 
the 
government’s 

responsibility to be doing,” 
said 
Robert 
O’Meara, 
vice 

president of government affairs 
for the Michigan Restaurant 
Association, in a press release.

In response to the criticisms, 

LaBarre said he thought such 
small 
policy 
changes 
were 

impactful on these issues.

“This is a good policy and 

the 
policies 
(Republicans) 

advocate for are largely bad, and 
so I’d rather have a patchwork 
good policy doing some good 
in some areas than a blanket 
awful policy. So they’re entitled 
to their opinion; they’re just 
wrong,” LaBarre said.

A number of Democrats on 

the board have also argued 
that 
the 
Republican 
effort 

to block the law is simply 
aimed 
attacking 
Michigan 

Democrats, and goes against 
the 
fundamental 
Republican 

principle of devolving power to 
states.

“It is showing that their 

advocacy of the principle of 
strong 
local 
government 
is 

really a bit of a charade, and I 
think they are for strong local 
governments until they are 
not,” LaBarre said. “I think 
they’re just being intellectually 
dishonest.”

However, 
Ken 
Kollman, 

director of the University’s 
Center for Political Studies, said 
while many people view the GOP 
as a devolution-friendly party, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 

alike tend to use devolution as a 
purely pragmatic tool.

“I wouldn’t take people’s 

positions on decentralization 
at face value,” Kollman said. 
“Very few people in politics 
are 
truly 
principled 
about 

devolution, 
decentralization 

and centralization. They tend 
to want to centralize policies 
when they have control on the 
central government and tend 
to want to decentralize policies 
when they have control of local 
governments that are different 
in partisanship from the central 
government.”

dealers and local manufacturers 
have made clear that they oppose 
any law that would allow Tesla 
to operate in Michigan,” the 
statement said. “As one leading 
legislator told Tesla: ‘the local 
auto dealers do not want you here. 
The local manufacturers do not 
want you here. So you’re not going 
to be here.’ Tesla will continue to 
take steps to defend the rights of 
Michigan consumers.”

Tesla did not respond to three 

requests for comment to its 
corporate headquarters.

In 
an 
interview 
with 

the 
Detroit 
News, 
Gisgie 

Dávilia Gendreau, director of 
communications at the Michigan 
Department of Human Services, 
said Tesla’s business model is 
not aligned with state law as the 
company does not have a contract 
with an auto manufacturer.

“The 
license 
was 
denied 

because 
state 
law 
explicitly 

requires a dealer to have a 
bona fide contract with an auto 
manufacturer to sell its vehicles,” 
Gendreau wrote in the email. 
“Tesla has told the department 
it does not have one, and cannot 
comply with that requirement.”

Law School Prof. Daniel Crane 

noted that the law in question 
arrived on Gov. Snyder’s desk two 
weeks before his reelection in 
November 2014, saying the degree 
of influence held by Michigan 
automakers and dealerships made 
vetoing it a near impossibility.

“The dealers are powerful in 

the state — particularly relevant 
are GM and Ford,” Crane said. 

“The dealers didn’t want to see 
Tesla expanding, and so the 
governor signed the legislation. It 
seemed to be the logical decision 
at the time.”

Tesla’s unconventional sales 

model 
has 
been 
subject 
to 

criticism since it first started 
selling cars in 2008. Rather 
than working with third-party 
franchises, the company uses 
small storefronts and an online 
directory to sell its vehicles 
directly to consumers, bypassing 
the added cost of dealership fees.

The majority of states have 

policies in place intended to 
prohibit the presence of stand-
alone stores like the Tesla model, 
motivated by what critics cite 
as 
an 
inherent 
competitive 

advantage 
of 
employing 
the 

factory-to-consumer model.

Tesla, however, claims that the 

unorthodox approach is less about 
cutting cost for the customers and 
more about educating the country 
about the merits of renewable 
energy.

“We want to engage with 

people 
when 
they 
are 
not 

thinking about buying a car,” 
George Blankenship, Tesla’s vice 
president of sales and ownership 
experience, said in an interview 
with Autotrader in 2011. “Our goal 
is not to sell a person a car, but to 
educate them on what electric 
cars and, particularly, what Tesla 
electric cars can provide. At a 
mall, people are already relaxed 
and out shopping on their own. 
Most of them will likely never 
have heard of Tesla, and so we 
are becoming part of their daily 
routines.”

Crane said Tesla regards the 

franchise dealership model as 

outdated, noting it has seen 
almost no change in the 100 years 
of its existence. He added that 
Tesla revised its sales model to 
best meet the needs of consumers 
and eliminate areas of inefficiency 
in the sales chain.

“Dealers traditionally make 

about a 4 percent margin on car 
sales and they make about a 25 
percent margin on servicing cars, 
so the real money here is the 
servicing of the cars,” Crane said. 
“Electric vehicles have very little 
service component: They don’t 
have filters and they don’t have 
oil changes. A lot of the servicing 
is Tesla downloading something 
directly to your car to update 
something, just like you would an 
iPhone. It’s much less of a money-
making margin than traditionally 
it would have been.”

In recent years, the direct 

distribution model has been 
adopted in a variety of industries, 
such as technology, to meet 
regulator 
requirements. 
To 

satisfy 
both 
consumers 
and 

demanding 
state 
legislators, 

Crane said he expected Tesla to 
compromise its stance on direct 
distribution.

“If you look at companies like 

Apple, you can go to a mall and go 
to the Apple Store, and all your 
dealings are directly with Apple,” 
he said. “Elon Musk — the CEO of 
Tesla — in the long run said maybe 
he could use a mixed model: 
sell cars both in dealerships 
and directly to consumers. The 
consumer is used to the idea that 
you transact business in multiple 
different ways. Eventually, the 
conversation is going to turn to 
whether we should be buying 
vehicles at all.”

is funded per each refugee it 
resettles.

Additionally, JFS will also no 

longer be the sole resettlement 
agency operating in the county. 
Samaritas — another national 
social service organization — 
announced in a September press 
release that it would be expanding 
its Ann Arbor foster care office 
and hiring a caseworker to handle 
the resettlement of 12 refugee 
families in the coming months.

Spokesperson Lynne Golodson 

said Samaritas plans to partner 
with JFS and other community 
organizations to help provide 
essential services to new arrivals.

When 
refugees 
arrive 
in 

the Ann Arbor area, they and 
their families work with a case 
manager on a daily basis for the 
next 90 days with the goal of self-
sufficiency, JFS case manager 
Nathaniel Smith told the Daily in 
March.

Assistance 
includes 
help 

with 
registering 
for 
proper 

identification, school enrollment, 
initial medical screenings and 
employment services. Follow-up 
English language training and 
career services are also available 
for up to five years after arrival.

“We address a lot of different 

areas of the refugees’ life, getting 
them set up with all the things 
that they need to start functioning 
on their own here,” Smith said in 
March. “For the most part, they 

are close to being financially self-
sufficient after 90 days.”

The biggest challenge with 

quadrupling JFS’s intake in two 
years, Eadeh said this week, has 
been finding adequate housing 
for newly arrived refugees due to 
concerns from property owners.

“(Refugees) 
have 
no 

background; they have very low 
income,” 
Eadeh 
said, 
adding 

that JFS has had several long-
standing relationships with a 
number of property managers. 
“The next few months I’ll be 
reaching out to landlords and 
housing management companies 
to work with them and ensure that 
refugees who come will be able to 
receive housing.”

To further meet the demands of 

its quadrupled capacity, JFS has 

also expanded its partnerships 
with community groups, student 
organizations 
and 
faith-based 

congregations for volunteers and 
donations of food and furniture.

More than 200 volunteers have 

been signed up for orientation, 
Eadeh said, and will play a role 
in sorting donations, helping 
new 
arrivals 
move, 
writing 

welcome letters and helping with 
paperwork in the JFS office.

“Our local elementary, middle 

and high schools are trying to 
do what they can,” Eadeh said. 
“University (students) are pitching 
in to help, as well as synagogues, 
mosques and churches.”

One of these student volunteer 

organizations — the Michigan 
Refugee Assistance Program — 
was established this semester by 

LSA senior Nicole Khamis.

Khamis said she reached out 

to JFS in late February to offer 
help with fundraising, off-put 
by negative political rhetoric 
surrounding refugees. During the 
summer, she decided to expand 
the scope of her organization 
following the surge in new 
arrivals.

“I began thinking about doing 

something like this after the 
extremely 
negative 
rhetoric 

about refugees,” Khamis said. 
“So I started seeing we could 
assist locally in the biggest 
humanitarian 
crisis 
our 

generation is facing.”

Khamis said she screened 

and selected 40 other University 
students to act as volunteers for 
JFS. The students will assist 

by running errands, acting as 
ESL teachers and helping with 
appointments. While the student 
volunteers are still undergoing 
language and cultural training, 
Khamis said she hopes the first 
volunteer engagement can take 
place in the coming week.

In addition to refugee service, 

Khamis said an additional aim 
of her organization is to raise 
awareness of the global refugee 
issue on campus through donation 
drives, movie screenings and 
panel discussions with refugees.

“When 
you 
don’t 
meet 

somebody and you only hear 
hateful rhetoric about them, you 
form an opinion about them,” 
Khamis said. “Really I think that 
can only be broken by personal 
contact.”

launched its part of the diversity 
plan. 
However, 
though 
LSA 

Dean Andrew Martin sent out 
an email about the forum dates 
on Aug. 30 and the events have 
been advertised across campus, 
the discussions received only 
a 
modest 
turnout, 
with 
the 

exception of a forum for staff. 
About 40 undergraduate students 
attended 
the 
student 
forum, 

and in total, about 230 students, 
faculty and staff attended the four 
forums overall. Conversation at 
the forums also tended to focus on 
a lack of student, faculty and staff 
involvement, and general under-
attendance.

In contrast, the protests in 

total over the past week have 
drawn more than 600. Hundreds 
of students, faculty and staff 
gathered Monday night to protest 
the 
racially 
charged 
posters. 

Almost 400 individuals, many 
of them University community 
members, protested the scheduled 
debate about the merits of the 
Black Lives Matter movement. 
Groups of students have also 
chalked the Diag or put up posters 
of their own throughout the week.

The discrepancy in attendance 

numbers was also present between 
the 
protests 
and 
a 
college-

sanctioned event for students to 
discuss the impact of this week’s 
events, which drew roughly 100 
community members.

Vikrant Garg, a School of Public 

Health first-year grad student, 
was one of the organizers for 
both protests. He said he did not 
attend the forums this September 
because he was not pleased with 
the how town hall discussions 
around the strategic plan last 
April and March were conducted.

“I had gone to the ones earlier, 

last year before coming back to 
campus, and I was not pleased 
with one, the way that they were 
run, and two, with the way that 

the plan was 
filled 
out,” 

Garg 
said. 
“It 
wasn’t 

really listening to student voices, 
even though it was a town hall for 
students.”

Garg 
said 
while 
he 
does 

not speak on behalf of all the 
organizers 
that 
planned 
the 

protests, he believes the space 
created at the student-organized 
protests was specifically for Black 
people and other students of color 
to talk about their experiences 
of racism and discrimination on 
campus, adding that those who 
live here feel the weight of national 
and local events.

“Personally, I think one of 

the reasons we shut down the 
Fishbowl (during a protest) is 
because we often find that the 
University addresses the problem 
are extremely disingenuous,” Garg 
said. “I will say that individually 
administrators do care. But I 
think that as an administration, it 
does not show that,” Garg said. “It 
is not something that is translated 
beyond 
the 
individual, 
those 

reactions feel as if they’re saving 
face.”

Elizabeth James, faculty advisor 

for the Black Student Union, wrote 
in an email interview that isolation 
is the main reason people of color 
may have not contributed to the 
diversity forums

“I really value speaking your 

truth. However, when people of 
color attend events such as forums, 
they often find themselves in the 
same situations that they face in 
classrooms or at the workplace: 
being seen as the “spokesperson” 
 

for your people and representing 
a group, rather than yourself as an 
individual,” James wrote. “It’s not 
fair, but it’s a reality.”

Similarly, 
Ross 
sophomore 

Kyle Trocard said Black students 
often also feel defeated by their 
circumstances at the University.

“The reason [no one attended] 

is that it’s a tough time for us 
with all the things going on on 
this campus, all the things going 
on around this country,” Trocard 

said. “We haven’t had time to take 
care of ourselves.”

In an interview Wednesday, 

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald pointed to the different 
natures of the protest and the 
LSA forums as reasons for the 
discrepancies.

“I think they’re really two 

different events, but, say part of 
the LSA strategic planning process 
— many of the units have had 
specific events that were designed 
for 
either 
students, 
faculty 

and staff, sometimes all three, 
sometimes separately, things that 
we’re thinking about doing and 
getting feedback,” Fitzgerald said.

However, beyond the events of 

this week, students said the mass 
attendance at the protests also 
illuminated 
broader 
concerns 

with 
the 
administration’s 

approach to campus diversity, 
with many citing doubts both 
about the University’s ability to 
make change and the sincerity of 
their desire to do so.

Channey said she attended 

both the protests and the the 
LSA-sponsored 
community 

event, but was disappointed that 
administrators seemed uncertain 
about how to proceed during the 
latter.

“I spoke to an administrator 

outside 
of 
those 
discussions 

about what they plan on doing 
in response to, for example, the 
fliers, and they say they do not 
know,” Channey said.

This, she added, might explain 

why Black students feel prompted 
to create their own spaces on 
campus instead of relying on the 
University.

But though the University-

sponsored event did not give 
her the experience she was 
hoping for, she said as a new 
student to campus, she still feels 
administration need to continue 
trying and they need to create 
more spaces for Black members of 
the student body to speak out.

LSA freshman Asia Green 

echoed Channey’s sentiments, 

saying she didn’t feel talking to 
administrators was an effective 
way to cause change.

“There are not enough events 

hosted, not enough forums,” 
Green said. “All of the people up 
higher always talk about how 
they want to promote diversity 
and inclusion but nothing is being 
done.”

Along 
with 
criticism, 

however, others pointed to a 
misunderstanding 
between 

administrators and students as 
the reason for a negative campus 
climate around diversity.

LSA freshman Carlena Toombs 

said at Tuesday’s protest that 
while she appreciates the steps 
taken by the University thus far, 
she feels the response was not 
entirely in line with what the 
Black community wants.

“I feel like it’s very hard for 

(the administration) to do what 
we, Black students, want them 
to do, but at the same time, I 
appreciate them allowing things 
like protests to go on, which I feel 
like is as much as they really can 
do, politically,” Toombs said.

James also suggested that 

the need to speak in front of a 
group of strangers during the 
forums may be another barrier, 
as 
a 
particularly 
vulnerable 

experience that students of color 
often face.

“After 
the 
posters 
were 

sighted on Monday, that evening 
hundreds of students gathered 
together in DAAS to view the 
Presidential 
debate,” 
James 

wrote. 
“That 
large 
number 

resulted not just because of the 
debate, but I believe it was more 
related to a need to feel safe after 
a threatening, scary moment on 
campus. Some of the students had 
never faced blatant racism before 
and it was reassuring, for them, 
as well as myself, to be together to 
commiserate and share time with 
our community.”

These issues — administrator 

inaction and the relationship 
between 
administrators 
and 

students — also figured heavily 
into specific criticisms of the plan 
itself, much of which has not yet 
been released.

Garg said he believes the 

plan’s goals are too far reaching 
for the current campus climate. 
The plan uses the year 2021 as 
a benchmark, and community 
conversations surrounding the 
start of the planning process 
asked the community what they 
wanted the University to look like 
in 2025.

“It doesn’t look at the problems 

today and find solutions, they are 
reacting in response to things that 
are happening they plan on doing 
something about this within the 
next five years. At the town hall, 
they asked “What do you want to 
see?” Garg said. “And people came 
up with concrete things that could 
be done immediately and they 
would be like okay, we can include 
that in our plan. We can ensure 
that by 2020. I’m not even going to 
be here in 2020.”

At 
Monday’s 
protest, 
LSA 

junior Lakyrra Magee, an event 
organizer, 
also 
criticized 
the 

long-term focus in the diversity, 
equity and inclusion initiative as a 
solution to campus climate issues.

“It’s possible to do both,” Magee 

said, referring to the University 
addressing current events and the 
five-year DEI plan. “But they’re 
not doing it. We want Schlissel to 
address us … about 2017, not 2025.”

Nonetheless, 
many 
of 
the 

students interviewed said they’ve 
seen traction across the University 
since the protests beyond these 
incidents, on broader campus 
climate issues.

Garg noted that the School of 

Public Health is now opening 
up a space for students to share 
their 
experiences, 
a 
meeting 

Tuesday between Angela Dillard, 
LSA’s new Associate Dean for 
Undergraduate Education, and 
the Dean of Students and a 
campus-wide conversation on race 
recently announced by Schlissel 
for Sunday.

Green said the response to the 

protests thus far has made her 
optimistic.

“The fact that we’ve been 

having so much support has 
really been making the situation 
better, and hopefully we can take 
it further in terms of getting it to 
higher executives and making 
sure people really do feel safe on 
campus,” Green said.

In discussing next steps for 

the 
administration, 
Fitzgerald 

stressed a campus-wide discussion 
on race that is slated to occur 
Sunday in response to the events 
of this week.

Schlissel 
announced 

Wednesday the University will 
hold a campuswide discussion on 
race following the events of this 
week on Sunday. Both Green and 
Garg said they were planning to 
attend Sunday’s event.

“I just know that the event for 

Sunday is something I noticed 
the president and other senior 
leadership are hoping a good 
number, and a cross-section of 
the entire University community, 
will come together and foster 
that kind of hearing from each 
other and speaking to each other,” 
Fitzgerald said.

James 
wrote 
that 
while 

diversity, equity and inclusion are 
noble goals for any campus, the 
small numbers of students,faculty 
and staff of color make it hard for 
them to feel comfortable, even in 
the best of circumstances.

“I believe the U’s diversity 

plans are promising and have 
great hope that they will result in 
a more inclusive university,” she 
wrote. “Maybe we just need other 
ways of collecting information 
about how to make it all come 
together. Sometimes I wonder if 
smaller focus groups with people 
of similar backgrounds wouldn’t 
provide richer discussions where 
people would feel free to talk, then 
later bringing the groups together 
to discuss the similarities and 
differences could provide a bridge 
to connecting the dots.”

O

ver the last decade, a 
major issue in Detroit 
politics has been rapid 

population loss that has plagued 
the city. While it can be easy to 
look at the decreasing numbers 
as a sign of despair, I look at the 
population numbers in a positive 
light. According to the 
2010 census, there are 
more than 700,000 
residents in Detroit, 
making it the 18th largest city 
in America, by population. But 
the greater Detroit metropolitan 
area, 
which 
includes 
Detroit 

and the surrounding suburbs, 
has approximately 4,292,060 
people, making it the 13th 
largest metropolitan area in 
America.

I’m not claiming that being the 

13th largest metro area in America 
entitles us to be treated the same 
way as the greater New York City 
is treated. However, metro Detroit 
lacks 
countless 
features 
that 

allow other metropolitan areas to 
operate smoothly. Detroit has the 
worst public and regional transit 
system in America, due largely 
to the city and suburbs failing to 
work together on transit goals.

Because 
of 
America’s 
car-

centric culture, the transit systems 
in any given American city lack the 
funding and infrastructure needed 
to compete with big European or 
Asian cities. However, Detroit’s 
transit system pales in comparison 
to other American cities. In 
Detroit, a trip from any given 
home in the city to the suburbs, 
where grocery stores, malls and 
low-income jobs are located, can 
take more than an hour in each 
direction. Additionally, bus service 
is unreliable, and many services 
don’t run late at night, meaning 
a trip to the store can leave one 

stranded in another city after dark.

Keeping all of this in mind, I 

decided to give the bus system a 
try. What I found was more than 
alarming. To get to my destination 
on the east side of Detroit, I had to 
take three buses, and the trip took 
more than an hour. Additionally, 

the buses were late, 
leaving me stranded 
in 
a 
neighborhood 

I 
didn’t 
know. 
If 

students at the University of 
Michigan had to ride Detroit 
Department of Transportation 
buses to class, they would 
certainly protest until the blue 
bus system returned.

The problems with Detroit’s 

transit 
system 
aren’t 
easily 

categorized 
into 
one 
specific 

problem. The city’s layout itself, 
spanning more than 140 square 
miles, is a contributing factor. It 
is so big that the combined land 
mass of San Francisco, Boston 
and Manhattan could fit into 
Detroit, and there would still be 
a sizeable amount of room left. 
Additionally, metro Detroit area 
transit providers are more than 
fractured. For example, Suburban 
Mobility Authority for Regional 
Transportation buses — buses that 
serve the suburbs of Detroit — are 
prohibited from picking up riders 
inside Detroit city limits, often 
leaving riders stranded.

Regardless of the reason, one 

thing is certain: Detroit’s transit 
system is a mess. Only 3 percent 
of jobs in the area can be reached 
within 60 minutes on public 
transit, and housing inequality 
prevents many people from living 
near their workplace. Bus service 
is infrequent, unreliable and ends 
too early in the night to service 
workers of all jobs. However, 
there is a solution: The Regional 

Transit Authority of Southeast 
Michigan 
has 
proposed 
a 

master plan that would overhaul 
Detroit’s transit system.

The main initiatives of the 

proposal include Bus Rapid Transit 
systems on the major streets in 
Detroit and an increase in 24-hour 
routes to serve more people in 
suburban 
areas. 
Additionally, 

there will be a commuter train 
service established between Ann 
Arbor and Detroit, and a BRT bus 
will run along Washtenaw Avenue 
connecting downtown Ann Arbor 
and downtown Ypsilanti.

The benefits of the proposal 

are sweeping and will help many 
people in metro Detroit have better 
access to their jobs and services 
across 
southeastern 
Michigan. 

However, the proposal will not go 
forward without an approval from 
voters on Nov. 8. This proposal will 
levy a tax of 1.2 mills — $1.20 per 
$1000 of property value — on all 
residents of Wayne, Washtenaw, 
Oakland and Macomb counties 
to finance the plan. This plan is 
crucial to the development of 
the region, and without it, the 
economic growth of the region 
will not happen.

Many University students are 

registered to vote in Ann Arbor, 
and many are also registered 
to vote in their hometowns in 
Wayne, Oakland and Macomb 
counties. A small increase in 
property taxes isn’t a huge 
burden to many homeowners in 
southeastern Michigan, but it 
can have a world of a difference 
for Detroit residents and any 
of us visiting Detroit. Detroit’s 
transit woes are great, but this 
election, suburban voters need to

FROM THE DAILY

From the Daily: Don’t give up

I

n fall 2015, University President Mark Schlissel introduced plans to 
create a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan for campus. This 
initiative specifies that by Oct. 6, the University will release a campus-

wide plan, composed of plans from each unit within the University, on 
localized strategies for improvement in diversity, equity and inclusion. Over 
the past two weeks, the College of LSA hosted four forums, one of which 
was advertised as being focused on undergraduates, to release its part of the 
plan. All of the forums, including the one focused on undergraduates, had 
very low attendance rates. Conversely, this week, more than 300 students 
spoke out against racist posters that were posted in Angell and Mason Halls. 
At these protests, students voiced concerns that the DEI initiatives weren’t 
doing enough to help students now.

While 
the 
University 
— 

in the most tangible way it 
has in years — attempts to 
answer 
students’ 
calls 
for 

greater diversity, equity and 
inclusion on campus, students 
are still left unsatisfied. For 
the most part, undergraduates 
aren’t attending University-
sponsored forums, and though 
they may acknowledge the 
changes the University has 
initiated, they are disappointed 
with any change to campus 
climate. Though the DEI plan 
urges colleges to implement 
strategies to produce both 
tangible initiatives and more 
abstract future plans, most 
changes will not make a major 
impact right now on campus.

Some examples of potential 

changes 
can 
be 
seen 
in 

the LSA DEI draft, which 
students can review online. 
The 
draft 
outlines 
plans 

to expand the laptop loan 
program, improve the Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
requirement 

within the LSA curriculum and 
allocate funding for learning 
communities 
specifically 

dedicated to creating a mixture 
of 
diverse 
cultures. 
While 

some of these programs will 
likely, in a small way, help to 
make students in marginalized 
groups 
feel 
more 
included 

now — namely the laptop loan 
program — most are geared 
toward change that will only 
become noticeable over time. 
Students want change now, not 
in 2025.

We 
acknowledge 
the 

difference 
between 
acting 

directly in response to actions 
like the posting of this week’s 
posters, 
which 
threaten 

student 
safety 
on 
campus, 

and advocating for a general 
change in campus climate. We 
acknowledge students do not 
feel safe or comfortable even 
speaking up at opportunties 
like the LSA forums because 
of the hostile environment on 
our campus. We acknowledge 
that this is problematic and 
urge 
adminstrators 
to 
act 

immediately to attempt relieve 
students of this pain. 

But we also acknowledge 

that change is a two-way 
street. Students should not let 
the University’s past inaction 
surrounding diversity, equity 
and inclusion stop them from 
persevering 
— 
continuing 

to voice their concerns now 
and into the future. The onus 
must be on both students and 
University administrators and 
faculty. If we are going to see a 
cultural shift at the University, 
students 
need 
to 
take 

advantage of opportunities the 
University is providing, and 
the University needs to listen 
when students speak up, and 
then continue implementing 
progressive 
policies 
and 

programs. While the LSA plan 
states that students should not 
be expected to solve campus 
climate 
problems, 
it 
also 

emphasizes 
the 
importance 

of student involvement in the 
process. Not only does the 
University need to listen to 
the student voice, but students 
must also make an effort to 
attend events, like the LSA 
forums. Students are tired of 
feeling like they are not heard, 
but staying silent is not an 
option. 

It is worth recognizing that 

much of the work to be done 
will be selfless work. Campus 
climate shifts aren’t going to 
happen overnight, and much of 
the work that we, as students 
and 
administrators 
and 

faculty, need to put in now may 
not be directly beneficial to 
us, but will hopefully benefit a 
freshman walking onto campus 
in five or 10 years.

The University needs to 

recognize the efforts students 
are taking to both protect 
themselves and their peers 
today, as well as alter campus 
climate for the future. Faculty 
and 
administrators 
need 

to listen to what students 
say 
when 
they 
speak 
out 

and then cultivate this kind 
of 
energy 
in 
University-

sponsored 
events. 
Forums 

geared toward more specific 
issues would help accomplish 
this: Instead of focusing on 
diversity very broadly, the 
University could host forums 
about Islamophobia, prejudice 
against Latino students or 
specific events on campus, 
like the recent community 
gathering hosted by LSA in 
response to the recently posted 
racist flyers.

Tangible changes that affect 

our community both now and 
years down the line start with 
students bringing the same 
energy they are bringing to 
protests and student-organized 
gatherings to the events that 
administrators are creating. 
Only 
through 
continuous 

and sustained collaborating 
with — not against — the 
administration can we change 
our campus, both now and in 
the years into the future.

M

onday 
morning 

was met with racist 
flyers spread around 

campus endorsing principles of 
white supremacy and blatant 
hateful sentiment. As painful 
and regrettable as this situation 
is, it serves to highlight the 
paradox underlying experiences 
of Black (and other minority) 
students on campus: On one 
side, they are met with faculty 
members and administrators 
drafting and designing extensive 
plans to address matters of 
diversity, and on the other side, 
down the halls of our buildings, 
they are met with posters 

attacking their very identity. We 
become so caught up in elaborate 
discourses regarding freedom 
of speech that we lose sight of 
the simple truth that human 
dignity and respect for others 
is not debatable.

As students are 
drafting 

statements 
(just 
like 
this 

one), creating safe spaces and 
hosting teach-ins, quality and 
justice cannot be empty words. 
Quality and justice must be 
fundamental, 
inalienable 

human 
rights. 
We 
must 

endeavor not to treat “diversity, 
equity and inclusion” as a 
flowery slogan, but rather we 

need to foster an accepting 
climate for all students. Though 
we do not have the power to 
control all prejudice and racial 
discrimination, we can stand in 
solidarity with those targeted 
and in unwavering rejection of 
those who disseminate hatred.

With solidarity,
LSA Student Government 

Equality and justice are fundamental rights

HELP WANTED

I

n August of 2001, some-
thing rather unusual hap-
pened in the state of Israel. 

There was a concert in Tel Aviv, 
which was entirely ordinary, 
and the 
famed Israeli 
conductor 
Daniel Baren-
boim led the 
orchestra, 
which was 
also ordi-
nary. But 
when Baren-
boim gave 
the down-
beat for his 
encore, something completely 
out of the ordinary happened — 
he played Wagner.

The encore had been preceded 

by 30 minutes of intense debate 
among conductor and audience 
after 
Barenboim 
had 
asked 

them if he could play Wagner. 
Shouts of “fascist” were heard, 
people stormed out and audience 
members in neighboring seats 
heatedly argued about what was 
to come. But by the end of the 
evening, the music of Richard 
Wagner had been played live in 
Israel for nearly the first time in 
the nation’s 50-year history.

It was not the first Wagner-

related controversy in Israel. 
Barenboim himself had tried to 
program some of the composer’s 
works nearly a decade earlier, but 
had cancelled following protests. 
In 1981, the Israel Philharmonic 
attempted to perform Wagner, 
but 
was 
interrupted 
by 
a 

Holocaust survivor leaping onto 
the stage, removing his shirt and 
brandishing his concentration 
camp scars.

It’s not difficult to see why this 

is a topic wherein passions run 
very high. If you were to ask the 
average person to tell you about 
Wagner, you would probably 
hear about his penchant for 
bombast (see, for instance, the 
use of “Ride of the Valkyries” 
in 
the 
famous 
helicopter 

attack scene in “Apocalypse 
Now”) and how he was Hitler’s 
favorite composer, the latter bit 
unsurprisingly being the point of 
contention. Hitler’s idolization 
of Wagner bled into the public 
sphere during his dictatorship, 
with 
the 
composer’s 
music 

appearing at state events, on 
propaganda broadcasts and more 
— all of which built a powerful 
web of negative connotations 
for those unfortunate enough to 
suffer under Nazism.

Wagner himself did much 

to straighten his candidacy for 
most-favored composer of the 
Third Reich. In his personal life, 
Wagner was notoriously anti-
semitic, a trait which revealed 
its noxious presence whenever 
he picked up his pen to do some 
prose writing, which was really 
rather often. One particularly 
sickening article that comes to 
mind is “Jewishness in Music,” 
about which the title really 
paints as much a picture as is 
needed. Some even suspect that 
Wagner’s operas — specifically 
“Parsifal” — contain Jewish 
caricatures. But aside from all 

the reasons why Wagner was a 
horrible human being (and there 
are many more in addition to his 
anti-semitism — see his bulbous 
ego, elopement with Cosima 
Liszt and general dickishness — 
yes, Richard Wagner, I know), 
there is still an impassable 
obstacle 
to 
dismissing 
him 

entirely: 
He 
wrote 
really 

excellent music.

“We need one day to liberate 

Wagner of all this weight,” 
Barenboim is quoted as saying 
in a Haaretz article published 
some years after the encore 
incident. 
And 
maybe 
he’s 

right. Or maybe he’s wrong. 
I’m not really sure. Either way, 
the whole issue raises some 
fascinating 
questions 
about 

the morality of experiencing 
art produced by bad people or 
that has been used in gruesome 
contexts. However hard we try 
to forget him, Wagner’s musical 
influence is inexorable, and 
uncomfortably often it’s for 
the better. Perhaps more than 
anyone in the mid-to-late 19th 
century, 
Wagner 
developed 

the harmonic language that 
led to some of the most radical 
and 
exciting 
innovations 

of 20th century music. His 
“Tristan” chord is perhaps the 
most famous example of this, 
but everywhere in his music 
there is a powerful confluence 
of 
chromatic 
harmony 
and 

expressivity. Perhaps this is 
why his music is so affecting 
— even the most phlegmatic of 
individuals have been known to 
be stirred by Wagner.

But 
much 
of 
Wagner’s 

influence 
is 
felt 
in 
his 

antecedence to other masterful 
minds. Ironically, some of the 
most fertile musical followers 
of Wagner were Jewish, notably 
Gustav Mahler — who forged 
gargantuan 
symphonies 
of 

Wagnerian 
dramatic 
scope 

— 
and 
Arnold 
Schoenberg, 

who carried Wagner’s daring 
harmonic ideas to their logical 
apex in his development of 
atonality. 
Even 
those 
who 

opposed Wagner lived in his 
shadow and had to reconcile 
with that fact. For instance, 
the French composer Claude 
Debussy, who is credited with 
creating musical Impressionism 
(though he detested the term), 
had a youthful infatuation with 
Wagner. Only later did he recant, 
breaking away from Wagner 
and German music and all that 
came with it, creating his own 
sonic language. Of Wagner he 
remarked, “A beautiful sunset 
that was mistaken for a dawn.” 
But he first had to gaze at the 
sun.

Is it possible then to exorcise 

Wagner 
from 
the 
Western 

Canon? The obvious answer 
seems to be no. Even if we 
stopped listening to his music 
(which probably isn’t ideal — 
I’m listening to the Prelude 
from 
“Parsifal” 
presently, 

and it’s really quite moving), 

his fingerprints are all over 
everything 
following 
him. 

Simply put, he is here to stay. But 
the more interesting question 
is whether or not, from a moral 
standpoint, we should try.

How much does the intention 

or motivation of the artist 
contribute to the ultimate value 
of the art? If Wagner intended 
to portray Jewish stereotypes 
in his operas, does that diminish 
the worth of the music? Or 
by contrast, how much does 
an audience’s reaction to a 
piece affect its value? If a large 
number of people (e.g. the people 
of Israel) are revolted by the art 
for one reason or another, does 
that mean that it is somehow 
less? It’s difficult to say. Placing 
either the creator or the receiver 
of art in the position of the 
ultimate arbiter of value seems 
to be fraught with peril.

Again, 
I 
don’t 
have 
the 

answers to these questions — if 
we’re being honest, probably 
nobody does (which I realize 
isn’t very helpful to you). I’ve 
had many circular conversations 
about this, all without reaching 
a satisfactory conclusion. But 
it’s worth thinking about. And 
it’s worth pointing out that 
this problem isn’t exclusive 
to Wagner. This whole article 
has ended up being far more 
Wagnerian than I had intended, 
but there are others in this same 
camp. For instance, Stravinsky 
was 
profoundly 
influenced 

by 
the 
Italian 
Renaissance 

composer Carlo Gesualdo, who 
wrote beautiful vocal music, 
innovated more in chromatic 
harmony than anyone until 
Wagner, but murdered three 
people, 
including 
his 
wife 

and infant child. Some of the 
more apocryphal details are 
rather horrifying. Thoroughly 
nauseating stuff. There’s an 
interesting Werner Herzog film 
about it if Germanic cynicism is 
your sort of thing. Regardless, 
Gesualdo 
helped 
create 

Stravinsky — who even wrote 
the foreword to a Gesualdo 
biography by the University’s 
own Glenn Watkins — and I love 
his music despite his murderous 
nature.

One of the challenges in this 

question arises from the cult 
of personality mentality that 
is found in classical music. 
Perhaps more than any other 
genre except hip hop there is an 
obsession with the artist. Just 
think about how much you’ve 
heard about Mozart’s demigod-
like childhood accomplishments, 
or Beethoven’s tragic deafness. 
Feature films abound. It’s all 
about the composer. But maybe it 
shouldn’t be. Maybe, as might be 
the case with Wagner, it would 
be better if we all just let it go. 
Maybe it’s better to just let the 
music be music.

Raise your hand if your hormones are raging,

Beach Slang’s newest release, 

A Loud Bash Of Teenage Feelings, 
is exactly what the title suggests. 
Think back to high 
school (dreary halls, 
squeaky 
lockers, 

overbearing adoles-
cent angst and des-
peration) and you 
will have captured 
the very essence of 
this album: some-
thing a little bit 
cluttered, a little bit 
messy, but mostly really just a loud 
fucking bash of chaotic teenage 
feelings, both good and bad. 

“Play it loud / play it fast / play 

me something that will always last” 
is how the opening track, “Future 
Mixtape For The Art Kids” com-
mences. Raw vocals layered over 
heavy guitar riffs, this track sets 
the mood for the entire rest of the 
album and captures attention with 
its imperfect yet strangely pleas-
ing composition. “Future Mixtape 
For The Art Kids” does not try to 
smooth over its wild hodgepodge 
of screaming background music, 
expressive vocals and choppy feed-
back. It’s a kind of honesty that is 
refreshing and perhaps the reason 
why Beach Slang’s music is able 
to resonate with a multitude of 
people, not just a select handful of 
emotional preteens.

This candidness continues in a 

majority of the other songs on the 

album. For example, “Spin The 
Dial” is mellower than “Future 
Mixtape For The Art Kids,” yet 
it holds the same appealing qual-
ity: a cluttered arrangement of 
unabashed truth. “Art Damage,” 

“Punks In a Disco 
Bar,” “Wasted Daze 
Of 
Youth,” 
“The 

Perfect 
High”— 

basically 
almost 

every song in this 
album 
comes 

together to create 
what seems to be 
the purpose of A 
Loud Bash Of Teen-

age Feelings: an anthem for the 
strange endearment of troubled 
youth. May we always remember 
them.

However, like every confused 

kid on the brink of adulthood, this 
album has its problems. Consider-
ing the album in its entirety, the 
songs generally repeat a similar 
sound and do not vary into the road 
less traveled. It’s a good sound, and 
one that Beach Slang has perfected 
into a well-oiled machine. Howev-
er, music that recurs over and over 
again makes even the best of melo-
dies boring and unforgettable. The 
indistinguishable qualities of “Art 
Damage” and “Wasted Daze Of 
Youth” or “The Perfect High” and 
“Punks In A Disco Bar” degrade 
the specifics of each song into a 
muddled blur. A Loud Bash Of 
Teenage Feelings has a good sound 
and a well-developed theme but 
isn’t varied enough, which causes 

the album to fall into irrelevancy 
and vagueness. Even compared to 
their last album, The Things We Do 
To Find People Who Feel Like Us, 
Beach Slang doesn’t seem to have 
made any strides to grow as a band. 
The song “Throwaways” paral-
lels “Hot Tramps,” while “Young 
Hearts” may as well be a continu-
ation of “I Break Guitars.” There 
does not seem to be any explora-
tion of other types of sound, within 
the album or from one album to the 
next. As authentic and engaging as 
A Loud Bash Of Teenage Feelings 
initially is, after listening to many 
of the songs in succession, it flat-
lines and fades into a forgettable 
tune. 

A Loud Bash Of Teenage Feel-

ings is not terrible, but it’s not note-
worthy either. It hangs awkwardly 
in a limbo of standardized songs 
brought to half-life with dynamic 
talent. Beach Slang gets by, but 
they don’t stand out; this band 
needs to try something new and 
completely spontaneous that may 
work or may not, but at least it will 
be something novel. Still, Beach 
Slang is a relatively young band, 
having debuted their EP just two 
years ago. Perhaps these first two 
albums are what they needed to 
find their footing in the punk rock 
world. Hopefully, future albums 
will be filled with amazing songs 
that push boundaries and dare to 
be diverse. However, in the mean-
time, thnks fr th mmrz, Beach 
Slang, but it’s time to put high 
school behind.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Since the concept of fear and the 

transfiguration of fear into films 
such as “Nosferatu,” it has become 
well-known 
that 

horror movies draw 
on 
the 
inherent, 

natural fears that 
are already pres-
ent in the minds of 
its viewers. How-
ever, it’s not only 
the 
adrenaline 

rush that draws us 
to watch a spooky 
flick, but also the anticipation of 
a final endgame — a conclusion to 
satiate viewers, more or less. Any-
thing appearing on screen is set to 
reach a resolution in 90 minutes, 
which is also why horror movies 
such as these burn bright and fast.

However, a sudden resurgence 

of classic cult flicks in the form of 
inspired television series has start-
ed taking over primetime. And 
while series like “Stranger Things” 
have gained a following for their 
ability to prolong suspense over 
eight episodes, shows like “Sleepy 
Hollow” fell from the spotlight 
after only one season. Theoretical-
ly, and if a horror-centered show 
plays its cards right, the multiple-
episode nature of TV gives more 
time to draw out suspense, as 
well as add in details, that a movie 
would often overlook for time 
purposes. However, there’s a thin 
line between effectively managing 
these concepts and losing viewers 
faster than drawing them in.

In 1973, William Friedkin’s 

revolutionary film “The Exor-
cist” debuted in cinemas around 
the world. Considered to be one 
of the greatest horror films of all 
time, “The Exorcist” left its view-
ers with profound questions of 

religion and reintroduced the 
world to the word “scary” in a time 
post-“Rosemary’s Baby.” In other 
words, “The Exorcist” was a ter-
rifying movie for its time. Since 
then, horror masters such as Wes 

Craven and Stephen 
King emerged into 
the 
spotlight 
of 

horror cinema and 
have succeeded in 
reproducing 
the 

same type of scary 
that Friedkin’s film 
brought to the table.

In Fox’s newest 

series, “The Exor-

cist,” a worried mother, Angela 
(Geena Davis, “Grey’s Anatomy”), 
captures the attention of local Rev-
erend Tomas Ortega (Alfonso Her-
rera, “Sense8”) when her home 
begins to show signs of a demonic 
possession. And, much like in its 
film predecessor, Angela’s daugh-
ter begins to act strangely.

So far, the pilot does a medio-

cre job of conveying true emo-
tion. Sure, the gloomy mood and 
the character personas match, 
but there really isn’t any romance 
to the act. The degree of separa-
tion that exists between the 1973 
“Exorcist” and the revamped 
series may serve to take away from 
the golden standard of horror cin-
ema produced between the ’50s 
and ’80s. For example, though one 
of the benefits of a horror series is 
to elaborate on details oftentimes 
skimmed over in movies, the pilot 
episode of “The Exorcist” leaves 
both specificity and direction alike 
to chance.

As a pilot episode, there is too 

much packed into the 60-minute 
allotment. The sequence of events, 
as a result, becomes hard to follow 
under the stress of the conflict-
ing storylines. While the pres-
ent moves toward the beginning 

sequence of the original “Exor-
cist,” the past is often referenced in 
haunting flashbacks experienced 
in a dream state by Reverend Orte-
ga. Though it’s easy to differenti-
ate between the dream world and 
the present, the initial sequence 
is difficult to follow. Hopefully, if 
the series continues past its pilot 
episode, this awkwardness will 
smooth out and appear only spo-
radically throughout the remain-
der of the season.

For devout followers of “The 

Exorcist,” the series’ pilot episode 
certainly brings a sense of nos-
talgia at the playing of the iconic 
score, especially as the carpetbag-
wielding priest’s silhouette is 
seen walking toward the famous 
exorcism. However, though the 
series obviously pays homage to 
the original, it’s important to note 
that it isn’t taking the same direct 
approach as the original film. For 
example, there are multiple exor-
cism cases discussed in this series, 
which opens the door for a broader 
discussion of demonic possession 
and the church’s actions toward 
such events. This also leaves the 
conversation open for a discussion 
on religion, which was heavily ref-
erenced in the series’ namesake, 
but not often elaborated on due to 
obvious time constraints.

On this same note, if the writers 

do wish to take the series past its 
current status as another extended 
horror movie, then they’re clearly 
taking steps in the right direc-
tion, so long as they can keep up 
with their own pace. And though 
the majority of this new series is 
jam-packed with easily forget-
table character introductions and 
dream states, the last couple of 
minutes shows progress toward 
the creepy edge that pushed “The 
Exorcist” into cinematic horror 
history.

FOX.

So hot she must be from hell.

FOX’s revival of ‘The Exorcist’ needs 
work to live up to classic namesake

There’s potential and nostalgia in new horror series, but it lacks edge.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

When you think about punk 

rock, what do you see?

It may be a young, shirtless 

Iggy Pop thrashing about on 
stage. Or a snarling Sid Vicious 
picking away at his bass guitar. 
Or maybe it’s something more 
recent — Protomartyr or Wavves. 
Though all fantastic and impor-
tant in the development of the 
genre, there is a pernicious under-
current beneath all of these imag-
es — none of them include women.

It’s no secret that punk, and 

rock more generally, has a history 
of being fronted and run almost 
exclusively by men. Whether con-
sciously or not, women have been 
seen as groupies, mere objects for 
the male gaze and rarely beings 
with their own talent, agency or 
ideas.

This characterization is not to 

undermine the importance of the 
women of punk rock, but to high-
light the gusto of those who broke 
down barriers. Kim Gordon is one 
such maverick. Most known for 
her role in Sonic Youth, Gordon 
has slowly but surely dismem-
bered the patriarchal domination 
of punk rock for the past three 
decades.

Called to action by the no wave 

genre, Gordon dove head-first 
into the music scene. Tackling no 
wave was like taking on every-
thing dominant gender ideology 
tells women not to be — disso-

nant, avant-garde and nihilistic. 
And she did so with aggressive 
grace. The unfiltered, raw nature 
of no wave, which sprung from a 
rejection of commercialized new 
wave, attracted Gordon with its 
performative artistry, as well as 
its accessibility. Like punk, any-
one can do it. It’s a genre built on a 
paradox; the artists don’t care, but 
they care enough to create. This 
kind of indifferent, brash attitude 
is especially jarring when carried 
out by a woman. And that just 
makes it all the better. Women are 
told they are built to be caring, to 
dote and be soft. Through no wave 
and punk, Gordon breaks down 
the mutual exclusivity of rock and 
the female experience.

Though not the prolific front-

man (Gordon was a bassist and 
occasional vocalist), her hand 
was ever-present in Sonic Youth’s 
work and performative style. 
Plucking her thumping, throb-
bing bass, she was no sideshow to 
the main, male act of Sonic Youth. 
Gordon, both in Sonic Youth and 
in side projects like Free Kitten, 
was and is integral to the act. 
She views music holistically — 
as something that is meant to be 
seen as well as heard. Music, espe-
cially live music, is meant to be an 
immersive sensory experience. 
With the help of husband and fel-
low bandmate Thurston Moore, 
Gordon and Sonic Youth pounded 
and rocked their way into new 
DIY, noise rock territory. In mak-
ing this kind of creative decision, 

along with the help of her band-
mates, Gordon is a true artist. She 
didn’t, and still doesn’t, fit any 
definable mold.

Further 
distancing 
herself 

from any distinguishable pattern, 
Gordon aimed to rid herself of 
her pretty, middle class shell. She 
wanted to be uglier, to be cool. She 
was once asked by a photographer, 
“Do you want to be cool or do you 
want to look attractive?” This con-
voluted universe in which beauty 
and coolness are mutually exclu-
sive is the one in which a female 
musician must reside, especially 
in punk. Dealing with this ques-
tion, Gordon chose to embrace 
the edge rather than bend to the 
power of commercialized beauty.

Years ago, Gordon was photo-

graphed wearing a shirt proclaim-
ing, “Girls invented punk rock, not 
England.” And that pretty much 
sums her up. Women in punk 
must face obstacles that men can-
not imagine; the scrutinization of 
every facet of their being hardens 
them. In rejecting a society that 
puts so much pressure on them 
to conform — in their demeanor, 
looks, intimate relationships — 
women of punk rock challenge 
problematic ideologies many of 
their male counterparts have 
never had to face and likely never 
will. Gordon, who is vocal about 
challenging these societal pre-
scriptions, epitomizes the punk 
persona: she identifies what she is 
told to be and then proceeds to do 
the exact opposite.

ALBUM REVIEW

It’s gutsy to sing. It’s even 

gutsier to sing in a really high 
range. Gutsiest, perhaps, is doing 
all of that with an 
almost surprising 
array of electron-
ics as accompani-
ment.

Tom Krell, also 

known as How To 
Dress Well, does 
all of this, and 
does it with rela-
tive ease. He did it particularly 
well in 2010 on Love Remains, 
his debut album, and maybe 
even better four years later, with 
What Is This Heart?

Care, released Sept. 23, fol-

lows accordingly. While the 
entire project should be prefaced 
with a warning of its polarizing 
(if not all-encompassing) nature 
— Krell’s nasally vocals can grow 
tiresome and simply aren’t to the 
tastes of some, and a distaste 
of his vocal style pretty much 
definitively means a distaste or 
the entire album — the end prod-
uct is certainly rewarding. In 
this sense, it can simultaneously 
be satisfactory and/or frustrat-
ingly unapologetic.

That being said, it’s mostly 

satisfactory. And the highest 
note of the entire album is also 
the first.

“Can’t You Tell,” arguably 

the jumpiest track, provides the 
first of many infectious hooks. 
“Wanna lay you down and take 
you right there / Take you right 
there / Can’t you tell?” It is here 

that Krell show-
cases 
potentially 

his greatest (and 
most 
unique) 

skill — a seamless 
blend of intimacy 
and experimenta-
tion. An organized 
jumble of echo-
ing 
background 

vocals and serene synths are 
proper compliments of the vul-
nerable lyricism.

This 
momentum 
carries 

through the first few tracks. On 
“Salt Song,” a cheeky whistle 
parlays into an appropriately 
straining outro. Immediately 
after, 
“What’s 
Up” 
features 

somewhat tropical production 
(“If you make a mess of me, I 
wouldn’t change one thing”) 
that works with lovey-dovey 
declaration.

Krell is so eager, so willing to 

play with the melodies behind 
his voice and it feels refreshing. 
Concurrently, however, the most 
glaring problem of the album 
arises: remaining genuine for the 
entire duration of it. Occasion-
ally, lines feel manufactured. 
In “Time Was Meant To Stay,” 
Krell pleads “But I know when 
the night is long you feel like you 

can’t go / On with the charade, 
the day to day gets bleak / Watch 
the bodies all around you fall 
like snow / But I’m standing here 
today babe, yeah you know that 
you gotta stay.” This love letter 
of a hook plays, to be sure, but it’s 
just kind of tired. We’ve heard it 
— or something that sounds a lot 
like it — before.

It’s also difficult at times to 

keep from discounting How To 
Dress Well’s style as being, well, 
outdated. Counter to that idea, 
however, is the discomfort of a 
package so developed in such a 
heavily ethereal manner. Hence 
the aforementioned polarizing 
nature of the sound, which is, 
really more than anything else, 
proof of a dynamic listening 
experience. This progressive-
ness makes up for Care’s some-
times repetitive nature.

It picks up the continuity of 

the album when energy drops 
off. “I Was Terrible,” dancey as it 
is, arrives just in time behind the 
relatively sleepy “Burning Up.” 
Such is emblematic of the proj-
ect, a sort of yin-yang in both 
concept and probable reception.

Distilled down, Care is some-

thing new, something a listener 
can explore with legitimate 
intrigue. Ultimately defined by 
its idiosyncrasies (both good 
and bad), it proves to be an easy 
tradeoff — one in which the 
“good” quirks win out.

JOEY SCHUMAN

Daily Arts Writer

How to Dress Well satisfies and 
frustrates equally on unique ‘Care’

Devendra 
Banhart’s 
new 

album, Ape in Pink Marble, is an 
easy, luscious ride. The album 
drifts 
seam-

lessly from one 
track to another, 
with little sty-
listic 
variation. 

The vibrato in 
Banhart’s 
voice 

makes hazy the 
line 
between 

reality and fan-
tasy. This is the intended effect 
of the LP, as Ape in Pink Marble 
comes across like a dream that 
you slipped into.

Banhart is an enigmatic fig-

ure. He’s of Venezuelan descent 
and sings some songs in Span-
ish, and his bilingualism adds a 
layer of mystique to his persona. 
Yet this is just a small detail in 
his charismatic public image. As 
a major figure in the freak-folk 
scene, his music is approachable, 
yet retains a dash of the psyche-
delic. This cocktail makes for 
relaxing yet eccentric sounds. 
Banhart’s music is not over-the-
top experimental, but has just 
enough weird shit in it to qualify 
as interesting.

Ape in Pink Marble is Devendra 

Banhart’s ninth studio album. 
Unlike his previous works, no 
songs are sung in Spanish. It is 
also instrumentally minimalis-
tic. Now, no one would have ever 
accused Banhart of being over-

produced, but this album feels 
particularly sparse. That’s why 
the sometimes-bizarre nature 
of the vocals can create a jarring 
contrast between the simplistic 
production and strange lyri-

cism. Banhart sings 
on the final lines 
of 
“Fancy 
Man,” 

“Sometimes I get to 
think / Is this fancy 
thing / Is this a 
fancy thought?”

As 
the 
words 

tumble out of Ban-
hart’s lips, the lis-

tener is transferred to Banhart’s 
semi-sarcastic conscious. The 
next track is the disco-inspired 
“Fig in Leather.” Banhart sing-
speaks over the beat like a char-
acter from Alice in Wonderland 
who just invited you to his tea 
party. “Hello is that you / Come 
right in, have a seat / Remove 
your shoes, enjoy some fruits 
/ Did I mention, ‘have a seat.’ ” 
Following the distinct absurdity 
of these two tracks, Banhart 
brings us right back to his com-
fortable, lucid soundscape.

This album, like many other 

of Banhart’s, is built around 
love. There are no blazon dec-
larations or cascading harmo-
nies of romance. Rather, it feels 
lived in — like when you remind 
someone you’ve known forever 
that you still really care about 
them. On “Lucky,” Banhart gen-
tly reminds his paramour, “Ooh, 
what I want to say to you / But 
I’m so very, very lucky.” Banhart 

later sings on “Theme for a Tai-
wanese Woman in Lime Green,” 
“There’s no one in the world that 
I love / And that no one is you.” 
Rather than build up his roman-
tic counterpart, Banhart offers 
little to no information on her 
distinct qualities. This inher-
ently creates a far more intimate 
foundation for their relation-
ship. Only Banhart knows the 
details, we’re just along for the 
ride.

Ape in Pink Marble themati-

cally varies from his previ-
ous 2013 release, Mala. On 
Mala, Banhart exhibited a soft 
yearning for love. This is evi-
denced in “Won’t You Come 
Over” which seems pretty self-
explanatory. Banhart, it seems, 
is now singing from a state of 
emotional 
satisfaction. 
His 

weird-in-a-good-way 
artistic 

expressionism is still present, 
as he reflects on his incognito 
nature on “Good Time Char-
lie,” (Ann Arbor shout-out? Is 
Devendra Banhart a Michigan 
fan in secret, is this the hidden 
connection in all of his albums? 
Maybe we’ll return to this later.) 
“Mostly been a bathroom stall / 
A night or work blow-up doll.”

Yet on Ape In Pink Marble, 

there is a steady and relaxing 
charm throughout. The same 
charm 
that 
you 
experience 

when you find a desk chair with 
really good lumbar support. The 
album’s a lovely and safe dream, 
with Banhart being our reserved 
navigator.

Michigan has now played four straight games at the Big House 
and hardly struggled with any of them. This one could be 
different. The eighth-ranked Wisconsin Badgers come to town 
for the first time since 2010, when they rolled to a 48-28 victory. 
This year, both teams come in 4-0, and both should be ready for 
a hard-nosed game that will be pivotal in the Big Ten race.

Both defenses have advantages in what 
should be a close game Saturday.

Hawaii (Sept. 3): Alohahahahaha.

Central Florida (Sept. 10): Is that what it looks 
like to get outhit?

Illinois (Oct. 22): No matter what happens 
on the field, both teams will (hopefully) take 
Champaign showers.

Michigan State (Oct. 29): It’s setting up to be 
the most exciting Michigan-Michigan State 
game in years.

Maryland (Nov. 5): Congratulations, DJ Khaled 
Durkin, you played yourself.

Colorado (Sept. 17): Colorado figured scoring 
28 would be plenty.

Iowa (Nov. 12): With a win, Kirk Ferentz receives 
ANOTHER contract extension with a special 
clause that names him lifetime governor of Iowa. 

Penn State (Sept. 24): Might need to rename 
Happy Valley soon.

Wisconsin (Oct. 1): We were going to try and be 
funny, but the dumplings in Madison are no joke.

Rutgers (Oct. 8): The Ahmir Mitchell Bowl.
Ohio State (Nov. 26): Who schedules a game

Wisconsin arrives for Big Ten showdown

The 
non-conference 
season 

is over, and so are most of the 
up-tempo 
spread 
attacks. 
The 

Michigan 
football 
team’s 

game 
against 

No. 8 Wisconsin 
on Saturday will 
feature 
lots 
of 

rushing, lots of 
physicality 
and 

lots of huddles.

The 

Wolverines 
haven’t 
played 

the Badgers since 
2010, but their 
opponent hasn’t 
changed 
much 

since then (except 
for two head coaching switches). 
Wisconsin is still a big, bruising 
team focused on the power rushing 
game and stout defense.

“Smashmouth — that’s just about 

the one word I could use to describe 
them and the problems that they 
bring,” said Michigan redshirt 
sophomore defensive end Chase 
Winovich. “They’re physical. I 
think they have like five tight ends 
that are over (250) pounds. They got 
some beef, so we got our hands full.”

Michigan 
coasted 
through 

the first four weeks of its season-
opening five-week homestand. The 
fourth-ranked Wolverines crushed 
Hawaii, flew past Central Florida, 
upended Colorado and steamrolled 
Penn State. The latter three teams 
each attempted to outrun Michigan 
with no-huddle offenses, but the 
Wolverines caught up to each at one 
point or another.

The Badgers present an entirely 

different challenge, and it will be the 
toughest Michigan has faced this 
season. They match the Wolverines 
pound for pound up front.

“I’m wondering if the field’s going 

to be wide enough,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “They play 
extremely hard — run, effort. I had 
the pressure of coaching (former 
Wisconsin star) Chris Borland 
a few years back (with the San 
Francisco 49ers), and it’s a team of 
Chris Borlands. High, high energy, 
tough guys that can run and (a) big, 
physical team.”

With each of Michigan’s first three 

opponents, though, the Wolverines 
could say the visiting team had 

not seen a team of their caliber, at 
least this season. For Wisconsin, 
that is not the case. The Badgers 
have conquered one of the toughest 
schedules in the country this season.

They stifled then-No. 5 Louisiana 

State, 16-14, in the season opener 
at Lambeau Field, home of the 
Green Bay Packers. Last week, they 
routed then-No. 8 Michigan State 
in East Lansing, 30-6, and took 
the Spartans’ spot in the poll. As if 
that weren’t enough, they will host 
No. 2 Ohio State after a bye next 
week. Considering that gauntlet, 
some didn’t circle this weekend’s 
game on Michigan’s schedule, four 
weeks before the Wolverines open 
a five-game stretch that includes 
showdowns 
against 
Michigan 

State, Iowa and Ohio State.

But the early success of both 

teams has made this game crucial. 
The winner will stay in good 
position to make the College 
Football Playoff, and the loser will 
have some work to do to reach the 
Big Ten Championship. And while 
the Wolverines refused to place 
extra value on this game, as usual, 
they did say the challenge of a top-
10 team excites them.

“They present stuff that we either 

need to do better with or prove 
ourselves with, and we’re excited for 
it. I can’t wait,” Winovich said. “As a 
defense, I’m sure everyone’s gonna 
be buzzing around this week to study 
for this opportunity. This is the first 
real shot to get to prove ourselves 
against another top-10 team.”

As many good teams as both 

schools have fielded this century, 
this will be their first matchup with 
both squads ranked in the top 10. 
The Wolverines are 49-14-1 in the 
series and 4-1 when both teams are 
ranked, though Wisconsin has won 
four of the past six meetings.

In 2009 and 2010, the Badgers 

averaged 46.5 points and 293 rushing 
yards with their physical rushing 
attack, winning both games by double 
digits. In 2008, the Wolverines had 
to rally from a 19-0 halftime deficit to 
win a 27-25 stunner.

In each of those three games, 

Wisconsin unleashed a pairing of 
potent running backs: P.J. Hill and 
John Clay in 2008, Clay and Montee 
Ball in 2009, Ball and James White 
in 2010. This year, Corey Clement 
heads the Badgers’ ground game, 
rushing for 251 yards and five 
touchdowns in three games while 
missing one with an injury.

The key to this year’s game 

should be whether Clement can 
move the ball on first and second 
down against Michigan’s defense. 
Typical of many Wisconsin teams, 
the Badgers boast a consistent 
offense, ranking third in the 
country in time of possession at 37 
minutes per game. The more they 
can string together long drives, the 
more success they should have.

But if the Wolverines are as 

strong on first and second down as 
they have been all season, they’ll 
have a chance to unleash their blitz 
on third down, when they have 
allowed their opponents to convert 
just six of 50 chances (12 percent). 
The battle in the trenches will be 
the difference.

“Whenever you’re playing a very 

physical opponent and a very good 
opponent, then yeah, there’s an 
opportunity to show what you can 
do out there as a football player,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“I’ve 
always 

believed that. Good football players, 
it’s kind of why they get together for 
games — good football players going 
against each other to show who the 
best is.”

It should surprise no one what 

Harbaugh said next:

“That’s the best thing about 

football, that competition.”

Sitting in the stands just before 

Michigan kicked off its 2015 season 
and ushered in the Jim Harbaugh 
era, Joe Allen was frantically trying 
to get a hold of his wife.

He was in Utah for the beginning 

of his son’s redshirt junior season, 
and he could tell from the way 
Kenny was warming up that he 
would be starting for the first time. 
Joe’s phone had just broken that 
morning, so there was no way to 
warn his wife Stacey — who had to 
stay home in Michigan for work — 
that it would be the biggest game yet 
of Kenny’s career.

Allen’s hometown of Fenton, and 

its 12,000 inhabitants, is just 40 
miles north of Ann Arbor. That night, 
Stacey and about 40 family friends 
packed a Buffalo Wild Wings there, 
convincing the restaurant to put the 
game on every single screen.

It had been a long journey already 

for the 21-year-old, and if Kenny saw 

the field, they weren’t going to miss 
any angle of it.

It had been a long four years since 

Allen committed to Michigan as a 
preferred walk-on, and now he was 
about to take the field to open the 
game in Salt Lake City. Though she 
couldn’t read names or numbers on 
the distant screens, Stacey knew 
her son when she saw him. As soon 
as the camera zoomed in enough for 
everyone else to see “Allen” on the 
back of his jersey, the Buffalo Wild 
Wings exploded in cheers.

At the very least, Kenny would 

be doing kickoffs. It may not seem 
like a lot, even to the most serious of 
college football fans, but that night in 
Fenton, he was the hometown hero. 

When he lined up to kick a 29-yard 

field goal in the second quarter, his 
mom and grandma started crying.

It was the culmination of years of 

hard work, from practicing on snow-
covered fields to travelling to camps 

to work on his craft, all the while 
receiving an endless supply of family 
support. 

“If you told me five years ago I was 

going to be kicking field goals at U 
of M, I would’ve thought you were 
crazy,” Kenny said.

In order to be successful as a 

kicker, everything else needed to fall 
into place perfectly. The kicker role is 
unlike any other in football, the most 
visible pass-or-fail position by far. In 
order to climb from youth club soccer 
to high school varsity football to 
walking on to a Division I team and 
earning a scholarship, Kenny Allen 
had to put the pieces together.

***

Over a year later, Stacey and 

Joe are preparing for their fourth 
straight home game of the season. 
It’s 10 a.m. on a 60-degree fall day, 
and they’re set up with the other 

Michigan moms and dads, each 
one bringing the full spread of 
sandwiches and chips and wings 
that define a tailgate. It’s an idyllic 
day, perfectly designed for football, 
and the parents of the players are the 
happiest people outside of Michigan 
Stadium. They’re the lucky ones in 
a crowd of 110,000 who can actually 
point out their kid on the sidelines. 

Most of the parents bring a crew 

of family and friends with them, and 
the Allens are no different. Kenny’s 
older brother, Jimmy, will join them 
shortly, and before the game starts, 
so will his 80-year-old grandparents.

This is the family’s fifth year of 

tailgating, but this season has been 
a little different. It could be Kenny’s 
last year of football, and he’s started 
each game this season. So far, he’s 
carried the load of all three kicking 
duties: field goals, punts and kickoffs.

As a freshman, Kenny was a 

preferred walk-on who specialized 
in punting. Despite being both the 
placekicker and the punter in high 
school, punting is what he excelled 
at, earning a scholarship to Oregon 
State. At 6-foot-4, he had the long 
and lean build for it. 

Despite the allure 

of 
a 
scholarship, 

when 
Michigan 

came knocking with 
promises of suiting 
up in maize and 
blue, it was hard to 
consider anywhere 
else, especially since 
Stacey earned two 
degrees 
from 
the 

University. 
After 

seeing the Big House 
in action for the first time during the 
Wolverines’ 2011 “Under the Lights” 
matchup with Notre Dame during his 
senior year visit, it was a done deal. 

With the proximity of Fenton to 

Ann Arbor, Allen always has a big 
crowd of family at games, regardless 
of his starting status. That’s the 
advantage of being a local kid at a Big 
Ten school. Faced with the option to 
move out to Oregon on scholarship, 
Allen 
decided 
that 
his 
family 

outweighed free tuition. 

“They’re very supportive,” Allen 

said. “My parents, my grandparents, 
my brother and sister, they’re at 
every game, always here, tailgating. 
… It’s meant everything because, you 

know, if there’s a bad day, I know they 
believe in me, even if I sometimes 
don’t believe in myself. There’s 
always someone I can fall back on, 
someone I can talk to, knowing that 
they’re always there.

“I guess my family, their support 

and love, was the reason I was able to 
do everything I was able to do. Being 
a kicker is not that cool, especially 
in high school. But they never said 
that, they just told me to do my best. I 
think if it wasn’t for them, I definitely 
wouldn’t have stuck with it.”

One of Allen’s longtime kicking 

coaches, Chris Sailer, explained it 
like this: “I remember his father 
being at every single camp. I 
remember him asking questions at 
every camp, as far as both of his boys’ 
development and what he could do 
to help them be better kickers, first 
of all, and then also, get to the next 
level. It was supportive in the right 
way; it was never overbearing or 
over-demanding. … I think having 
that support behind a young athlete 
is huge.”

On top of working with his dad, 

Kenny competes with his brother. 

Jimmy Allen, who 
is two years Kenny’s 
senior, was the first 
one in the family 
to 
start 
kicking. 

Kenny grew up with 
a love for soccer, 
something 
that 

seemed 
inevitable 

considering 
his 

dad 
played 
the 

sport collegiately at 
Oakland University. 

That love evolved 

into kicking footballs. Jimmy still 
kicks too, playing in the Indoor 
Football 
League 
for 
the 
Iowa 

Barnstormers and holding his own 
kicking camps. According to Stacey, 
their relationship is “very loving, but 
highly competitive” and always has 
been.

As long as it was a clear day, Kenny 

and Jimmy would go outside to 
practice kicking. In the winter, that 
meant bringing a shovel along with 
their football equipment in order to 
clear off a patch on the 30-yard line. 
Sure, they’d lose a few balls in the

Fifth-year senior Kenny Allen was once an unknown walk-on from Fenton, Mich., but he has earned Michigan’s starting kicking job.

“There’s always 
someone I can 

fall back on, 

someone I can 

talk to.”


snow now and then, but it was worth 
it to keep up with their obsession. 

On the days they couldn’t quite 

make it outside, they still found a 
way.

“We had an indoor net in the 

basement,” Joe said. “I think our 
ceiling was about eight or nine feet, 
and every time they kicked, it would 
hit the ceiling tile. It was like non-
stop.”

Part of the football infatuation may 

have evolved from the lack of things 
to do in a small Michigan town, too. 

“There wasn’t really much to do 

in Fenton,” Kenny said. “There’s a 
lot of lakes, a football field and some 
places to eat. But yeah, there’s not 
much to do.

“I spent most of my time kicking.”
When his brother graduated in 

2010, Kenny took over the starting 
kicker role and quit soccer for good. 
Then, the practicing grew even more 
incessant.

“People used to joke, every time 

they drove by the high school in 
Fenton, they would see balls flying 
through the air,” Stacey said. “He 
was there every day, non-stop, 
practicing. He was just so focused 
and dedicated. For me, maybe (I’m) 
just being Mom, but all he needed 
was an opportunity, and he would get 
what he was looking for.”

Allen finally ended up with his 

opportunity last season, but it wasn’t 
the one anyone was expecting. 
Australian 
punter 
Blake 
O’Neill 

showed up on campus as a graduate 
transfer, and if Allen wanted to get on 
the field that season, he would have 
to find another way.

“It’s bad enough that someone 

new came in to punt and he was a 
male model,” Kenny said. “I’m just 
like sitting behind this great punter 
who’s also super good-looking. But 
Blake is one of my 
best friends, he’s an 
awesome guy. 

“It kind of sucked, 

but that’s what they 
wanted and I’m not 
going to argue with 
them.”

Watching 
from 

the 
stands, 
there 

wasn’t 
much 
that 

Stacey and Joe could 
do.

“He 
expected, 

you know, Big Ten football, you’re 
going to wait your turn,” Stacey said. 
“And he had waited his turn, and 
then he had to wait a little longer. 
I mean that’s just part of it. He’s so 
happy to be a part of this team. I 
mean, really, for him, it was just a 
little glitch. Just a glitch. He was so 
happy just to be here.”

Still, 
Allen’s 
competitive 
fire 

pushed him. After three years of 
letting placekicking duties fall to the 
wayside, he decided that they would 
have to be his ticket to starting. It 

took him the first week of fall camp to 
“knock the rust off,” but he was able 
to work his way into the competition. 
With a new coach who places a 
premium on competition, Allen knew 
he would have to prove he was good 

enough to play.

In between the 

Utah game and the 
Wolverines’ 
home 

opener 
against 

Oregon 
State, 

Kenny 
earned 

a 
scholarship. 

Fittingly, the news 
came 
just 
before 

he was to face the 
only team that had 
offered him a full 
ride out of high 

school. That Saturday, he went 2-for-
2 on field goal attempts.

***

Allen is now comfortable in his 

role for the Wolverines, not allowing 
much to bother him. Those years of 
practice in the Fenton snow have 
solidified that mindset.

Not even his parents, as close as 

they are to Kenny, talk football with 
him anymore.

“We’re just parents,” Joe said. 

“Football, he does, and we want to 
be there as a backup support, but 
we don’t wanna talk about — I think 
I did enough when we talk about 
actual kicking, when we go out 
kicking together — but we want to 
leave the football and everything else 
he does alone. We don’t ask him any 
questions about who the starters are 
or anything else. We just let it go.”

The kicking role is just as mental 

as it is physical. During games, you 
can watch Allen walk up and down 
the sidelines by himself, sometimes 
sitting on the bench far away from 
the other players. He needs to stay 
locked in and focused for nearly four 
hours at a time. While every kicker 
deals with the pressure differently, it 
seems Allen deals with it by taking a 
step back.

“It’s a unique position,” Sailer said. 

“You’re not the quarterback. You’re 
not the wide receiver who gets a ton 
of the glory. You’re someone who’s 
counted on in certain situations and 
expected to perform. If you perform, 
it’s a great deal and you’re the hero 
for the week. If you don’t perform, 
unfortunately, you’re really the goat 
of the week, and they’ll put all of the 
blame of the loss on you sometimes.”

Kenny doesn’t often feel anxious

Allen now performs all three duties in special teams for the Wolverines — kickoffs (above), punting and field goals. He earned a scholarship early last season.

about his duties as kicker. The only 
time he said he was only worried 
about kicking a field goal was his 
very first attempt as a starter at 
Utah. Last season, his level-headed 
approach showed on the field when 
he made 18 of his 22 field goal 
attempts and completed 100 percent 
of his extra point attempts. 

According to Sailer, kickers need 

to enjoy being in the spotlight while 
learning to take credit for the success 
as well as the defeat. That’s a tall 
order for most burgeoning players, 
and it takes a unique personality to 
want to be in those situations.

Though 
he’ll 
admit 
that 

football takes up most of his time, 
he nonchalantly plays off how 
much time he actually spends at 
Schembechler Hall. He says that 
he’ll watch movies, and take naps, 
especially with his border-collie 
lab, Charlie. Sometimes, he has 
enough time to take Charlie on two 
walks a day. 

He talks about how his parents 

met while they were his age, 22, 
and how that doesn’t give him much 
hope for the future (“That’s why 
I have a dog,” he joked.) He’s not 
afraid to poke fun at himself.

“You don’t become a starting 

kicker for Michigan and earn a 
scholarship and have interviews 
like this one if you don’t have that 
demeanor,” Sailer said. “You can’t 
be too high on yourself and be 
over-boastful and too confident. 

It’s more about staying humble, 
understanding 
it’s 
continued 

hard work, but also keeping that 
confidence up. That personality is 
very common (in kickers). I think 
if you talk to the majority of the 
top college kickers, you talk to NFL 
players, they’re going to have a very 
nonchalant yet confident attitude 
and always expect to be successful.”

He plays off his life like he is 

ordinary, and that’s what sets him 
apart. 
His 
easygoing 
approach, 

coupled 
with 
his 
work 
ethic, 

breeds his success. In order to stay 
unflappable in the face of adversity, 
Kenny has to be Kenny. 

***

Sometimes, Allen will send his 

parents pictures of 
himself with former 
Wolverines 
greats 

such as Tom Brady 
or Charles Woodson. 
He didn’t quite get 
his own photo with 
basketball 
legend 

Michael Jordan, but 
snuck into the back 
of one and tweeted 
it out, calling it the 
“best photo bomb 
ever.” 

It’s no surprise when they get 

these kinds of pictures anymore. 

“Oh, nice day to be Kenny,” Stacey 

will laugh.

These opportunities all come 

with being a Wolverine, and Kenny 
has wanted to be one since he was 
a child. Not for the pictures with 

celebrities or the perks of being a 
student-athlete, but because his 
family instilled a love for Michigan 
at a young age.

“I 
just 
admired 
everything 

about this place and watching 
the Michigan-Ohio State games, 
Michigan-Michigan State games, 
like that was the craziest thing I had 
ever seen,” Kenny said. “I wanted to 
be a part of it, but as a little kid, you 
have these dreams and aspirations 
of doing that and then you get to 
high school and reality kind of hits 
you in the face. Like, ‘Yeah right, I’m 
never going to do that.’ 

“And then, the more I kept 

working, the closer that became 
reality and it was almost there. I 
just kept working, my family kept 
encouraging me and like telling me 

these steps to take 
and going to these 
coaches, 
spending 

my time going to the 
fields when everyone 
else was doing God 
knows what. I just 
think working hard 
and 
never 
giving 

up and having the 
support of my family, 
that’s why I chose 
football.”

Back at the tailgate, all of the 

reasons for his success gathered 
under the tent. Kenny’s parents 
gave him the unconditional support, 
his brother gave him the fire to 
compete and Michigan gave him a 
chance. Now, Kenny Allen has put 
it all together, and the picture looks 
pretty good.

Behind Enemy Lines: 
CB Sojourn Shelton

When the No. 4 Michigan football 

team hosts No. 8 Wisconsin on 
Saturday, it knows it will be in for a 
physical battle.

The Badgers have allowed just 

3.2 yards per carry and one rushing 
touchdown through four games, but 
that’s not the only way they have 
been beating opponents.

Cornerbacks Sojourn Shelton and 

Derrick Tindal each have five pass 
breakups on the season, making 
them one of the most statistically 
productive secondaries in the nation. 
Both picked off Spartan quarterback 
Tyler O’Connor last week in a 30-6 
victory in East Lansing, the Badgers’ 
most impressive victory to date.

The Wolverines’ wide receivers, 

especially fifth-year seniors Jehu 
Chesson and Amara Darboh, should 
be targeted often, given Wisconsin’s 
success at stopping 
the run, but Shelton 
and 
Tindal 
have 

made throwing the 
ball 
against 
the 

Badgers difficult so 
far this season.

The 
Daily 
sat 

down with Shelton 
at Big Ten Media 
Days in Chicago in 
July to talk about 
the top cornerbacks 
in the conference, 
playing in Ann Arbor and facing 
tough early competition.

The Michigan Daily: Because of 

a weird scheduling quirk, Wisconsin 
hasn’t played Michigan since 2010. 
Are you looking forward to heading 
to Ann Arbor?

Sojourn Shelton: Of course. It’s 

just one of those teams that you just 
can’t shy away from, especially the 
atmosphere. I’m hearing from people 
that I know that played at Michigan, 
I hear it’s a crazy atmosphere. And 
they’re a good, solid team. They have 
a lot of good, solid players. Of course, 
everybody will pick them to be this 
and that, but at the same time, when 
game time comes around, all the 
teams have got to put it together. I 
expect Michigan to be a solid team, 
as usual.

TMD: The classic Big Ten was 

known as a kind of “ground and 
pound” kind of league, but now the 
conference has plenty of talented 

receivers and cornerbacks like 
yourself, Iowa’s Desmond King, 
Michigan’s Jourdan Lewis. How 
do you feel about the changing 
landscape of the Big Ten, and do 
you compare yourself to those 
other guys?

SS: Of course, those guys are 

truly elite. You look at Desmond 
King, you look at Jourdan Lewis — 
those guys are playing extremely 
well at football. Whenever I can get 
a chance to look at their game and 
kind of take something from their 
game, I’ll be the first to tell you that 
I do it. Everybody as corners, we’re 
all different. We all do something 
well, and you can’t be afraid to 
just watch film on them to see how 
things are turning out and how their 
defense is ran.

Saying that the Big Ten is a 

“ground and pound” conference — 
I mean, traditionally it is, but when 
you watch the games nowadays 

and 
the 
football 

being 
played 
in 

the Big Ten, you 
can see it’s a lot of 
teams throwing the 
ball around. Look 
at Indiana — they 
throw it around a 
lot. Ohio State, they 
throw it around a 
lot. 
These 
teams 

still run the ball 
a lot, but they’ve 
added the passing 

game to their games and their 
game plans.

TMD: For the third straight 

year, you’re starting off facing an 
SEC team (Louisiana in 2016 and 
2014, Alabama in 2015). Do you 
like starting off facing the top 
competition right away?

SS: I do. It’s really fun. Those are 

some games that I’ll take with me 
and remember for the rest of my life. 
I remember going to Houston the 
first time and being excited, playing 
against LSU. To me, those are the 
teams that were dominant growing 
up. Talking about LSU being, in my 
era, growing up, being one of the 
best teams in the nation. And then 
last year, playing Alabama, which 
we all know how Alabama is every 
year, in and out. What other way to 
start off the season to see if you’re 
ready? We know, just control what 
we can and start as fast and strong 
as possible, and just play hard.

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Wisconsin

After four weeks of having a 

clear advantage over its opponents 
in nearly every phase of the game, 
the No. 4 Michigan football team 
will finally face a challenge this 
weekend when No. 8 Wisconsin 
comes to Ann Arbor.

Not much was expected from 

the Badgers before the season 
— especially considering their 
current 
stretch 
features 
four 

straight games against the four 
best teams in the Big Ten last 
season, with three of those on the 
road. But Wisconsin surprised 
everyone by jumping out to a 4-0 
start, knocking off then-No. 5 
Louisiana State at Lambeau Field 
in Green Bay, Wisc., and then-No. 8 
Michigan State in East Lansing and 
setting up a top-10 showdown with 
the Wolverines this weekend.

The Daily breaks down what 

should be the biggest game played 
at Michigan Stadium this season.

Michigan 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Wisconsin rush defense

The Wolverines’ running backs 

had their best game of the season 
last week against Penn State, picking 
up 326 yards and six touchdowns 
on the ground. Michigan’s stable 
of four running backs, led by senior 
De’Veon Smith, all found the end 
zone, making running back coach 
Tyrone Wheatley’s distribution of 
carries look ingenious.

Wisconsin has the pieces to 

stuff that run game, though, and 
it probably won’t need to pack the 
box to do so like Central Florida 
did three weeks ago. The Badgers 
have allowed just 3.2 yards per 
carry 
and 
only 
one 
rushing 

touchdown. 
They 
kept 
LSU’s 

Leonard Fournette out of the end 
zone and held the Spartans to just 
two field goals last week.

Edge: Wisconsin

Michigan 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Wisconsin pass defense

On paper, fifth-year senior wide 

receivers Jehu Chesson and Amara 
Darboh look to have an advantage 
against 
Wisconsin’s 
secondary. 

Both stand over 6 feet tall — and 
senior tight end Jake Butt checks 
in at 6-foot-6 — while Badgers 

cornerbacks Sojourn Shelton and 
Derrick Tindal are 5-foot-9 and 
5-foot-11, respectively.

But size hasn’t hurt the Wisconsin 

duo so far, as they have combined 
for ten pass breakups this season, 
tied for the second-most by any 
teammates in the country. And with 
the Wolverines having won so many 
blowout games so far this season, 
redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight hasn’t had to throw 
the deep ball too often yet.

Michigan 
certainly 
has 
the 

talent to win this matchup, but it 
won’t be easy.

Edge: Wisconsin

Wisconsin 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan rush defense

Wisconsin’s Corey Clement is 

a very talented running back, but 
Michigan’s defense is on another 
level than most other teams in the 
country right now. The Wolverines 
lead the nation in tackles for loss 
with 44 — redshirt sophomore 
linebacker Jabrill Peppers has 9.5 
by himself — and haven’t allowed 
many backs to get the best of them, 
save for a few big plays.

Case in point: running back 

Saquon Barkley was essentially 
the only functioning part of the 
Nittany Lions’ offense last week, 
both out of the backfield and as a 
pass catcher, and Michigan still 
limited him to 136 total yards and 
no touchdowns.

The Wolverines may even be 

more dangerous now that they are 
fully healthy — senior defensive 
end Taco Charlton (ankle) was 
back in the lineup last weekend, 
and redshirt sophomore defensive 
tackle Bryan Mone (undisclosed 
leg injury) practiced this week and 
could make his return Saturday.

Edge: Michigan

Wisconsin 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan pass defense

The 
Wolverines’ 
secondary 

suffered a huge loss last week 
when fifth-year senior cornerback 
Jeremy Clark tore his anterior 
cruciate ligament, but it also 
welcomed back an All-American 
in 
senior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis. Replacing Clark will take 
a concerted effort from redshirt 
sophomore Brandon Watson and 

freshmen David Long and Lavert 
Hill, 
but 
Michigan’s 
starting 

lineup remains strong. Lewis’ 
counterpart, 
senior 
Channing 

Stribling, was ranked as the best 
corner in the Big Ten by Pro 
Football Focus College Football 
before Lewis’ return.

The Wolverines will have to 

contend with wide receivers Jazz 
Peavy and Robert Wheelwright, 
both of whom have already eclipsed 
200 receiving yards this season. 
And for the first time all season, 
they’ll also have to deal with a pass-
catching tight end, Troy Fumagalli, 
who has 14 catches for 169 yards. 
New Badgers quarterback Alex 
Hornibrook has been very steady 
for a redshirt freshman, especially 
against Michigan State last week, 
but Lewis and Stribling present a 
difficult obstacle.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Peppers is quickly establishing 

a reputation as one of the best punt 
returners in the country, racking 
up an FBS-best 227 return yards 
and a touchdown. He very nearly 
took another punt to the house last 
week, but he stumbled in the red 
zone and had the play brought back 
because of sideline interference. 
Additionally, Michigan and Texas 
are the only two teams in the 
country to have blocked three kicks 
or punts.

On the opposing side, Wisconsin 

kicker Rafael Gaglianone is out 
for the season with a back injury 
after starting 7-for-8 on field 
goals (4-for-4 on kicks longer 
than 40 yards) and 10-for-10 on 
extra points. The Badgers rank in 
the middle of the pack in ESPN’s 
special teams efficiency (58th in 
the FBS), while the Wolverines 
rank second.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

This is the first top-10 matchup 

in Ann Arbor since Michigan 
knocked off Ohio State in 2003, 
and the excitement among the 
Wolverines’ fan base has reached 
a 
fever 
pitch. 
Even 
though 

the team hasn’t faced a real 
challenge yet, Michigan is a Big 
Ten and national championship 
hopeful in the eyes of its fans and 
players alike.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

has said that the team is treating 
every opponent like a top-10 
team, but now it has a chance to 
beat a real one. The Wolverines 
haven’t faced Wisconsin since 
2010, and it’s the first time that 
the two teams have ever met 
while both were ranked in the 
top 10.

The Wolverines will need some 

quality wins to state their case for 
the playoff, so Saturday is a great 
time to start.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan 
24, 

Wisconsin 17

Wolverines, Badgers should have advantages with stout defenses, but special teams could make difference

What to Watch For: Wisconsin

When the Wisconsin football 

team knocked off then-No. 5 
Louisiana State to open the 2016 
season, it was only natural to start 
looking ahead toward its Week 5 
visit to Ann Arbor.

And after the Badgers routed 

Michigan State in East Lansing last 
week, that game is now here, and it 
could be Michigan’s first game of 
Big Ten play with major conference 
title implications.

Here’s what to watch for when 

No. 4 Michigan and No. 8 Wisconsin 
take the field on Saturday:

1. 
Just 
how 
many 
Chris 

Borlands are there?

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

likened the Badgers to a team of 
Chris Borlands, a reference to the 
former All-American Badger and 
Harbaugh’s former linebacker with 

the San Francisco 49ers.

And while we’re dubious about 

Borland’s potential as a cover 
corner, Harbaugh’s point stands. 
Wisconsin’s defense is ranked 12th 
nationally (right behind Michigan) 
in total defense and seventh 
nationally in scoring defense.

Leading 
the 
way 
is 
their 

10th-ranked rush defense, and for 
a Michigan team that is coming off 
a 326-yard performance against a 
porous Penn State team, that could 
be a wake-up call. Linebacker T.J. 
Watt, brother of J.J. Watt, is tied 
for eighth nationally in sacks, 
which should be enough to put a 
scare in Michigan quarterback 
Wilton Speight.

The 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 

line has made visible strides 
since 2013 and 2014, but the 
Badgers should put them to a 
very real test. What happens in 
the trenches when Michigan is 
on offense should go a long way 
toward deciding this game.

2. How, and how much, will 

Michigan use Jabrill Peppers?

Last season, Peppers didn’t play 

on offense until the Wolverines 
played Michigan State. This year, 
with the secret out, Michigan hasn’t 
had to keep his offensive abilities 
under wraps until its first big game.

So far this year, Peppers has 

just two rushes for 24 yards. 
But he has also been used as a 
decoy on a sweep and even split 
out as a receiver. His speed is 
at least as good as any of the 
Woverines’ running backs, and his 
playmaking ability is unmatched. 
Against Wisconsin, it makes sense 
that Michigan could need him to 
contribute heavily in all three 
phases.

He has already taken one punt 

to the house against Colorado, and 
he nearly did it again last week, 
so how often the Badgers even 
decide to kick to him will be worth 
watching. Then when you factor in 

his role as a hybrid linebacker on 
the Wolverines’ defense, it stands 
to reason that he could see his 
most snaps of the year if the game 
is close.

3. How often will Speight 

throw deep?

Last week, Speight’s longest 

completion of the season went for 
25 yards to senior tight end Jake 
Butt, a significant departure from 
his willingness to throw deep 
against Central Florida.

Part of that could be based on 

need — why chuck it deep in a 
blowout? But this week, Michigan 
could find itself in a close contest, 
where throwing it deep is a 
necessity.

If that is the case, the Wolverines’ 

top downfield threat will need 
to re-emerge. Fifth-year senior 
receiver Jehu Chesson has had just 
one catch for 18 yards combined in 
the past two games.

4. Will Michigan’s D-line be 

back to full strength?

One week after the Wolverines 

got senior defensive end Taco 
Charlton and senior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis back from injury, 
the defense could get another boost 
against Wisconsin.

Redshirt sophomore defensive 

tackle Bryan Mone left the opener 
with an undisclosed injury, but both 
Harbaugh and defensive line coach 
Greg Mattison mentioned his return 
as a possibility for Saturday. Mattison 
said Mone has been practicing this 
week, and if he does indeed return, 
it would mark the first time this year 
that the Wolverines have their full 
rotation on the line.
