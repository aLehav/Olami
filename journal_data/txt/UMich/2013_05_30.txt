r Michigan defeated Alabama
o before losing to Florida and
e Georgia. As always, the message
was to play one game at a time.
"The one thing they've been
telling me is to soak it all in,
embrace it, and just play in the
moment," Lane said. "Don't get
caught up in everything that's
going on around it. It's just a
game, nothing has changed. Just
go out there and have fun."
And like Lane, none of her
teammates have gotten closer
to the WCWS than their own
televisions.
"It's everyone's dream," said
sophomore catcher Lauren
Sweet. "I've been watching it on
TV my whole life and I just can't
even believe that I'm going to get
the chance tobe there."
Added junior first baseman
Caitlin Blanchard: "We were
talking about it this morning.
We've never been there before
so we don't even know what to
expect. It's really exciting."
Thursday night will be a
battle between two experienced
coaches at the helm of two
strong programs. This year
marks Hutchin's 10th trip to the
WCWS in her 27-year tenure
at Michigan, including one
national championship in 2005.
Meanwhile, in 19 years as head
coach, Oklahoma coach Patty
Gasso has led her team to seven
WCWS appearances, including a
national championship in 2000.
While the Sooners pose the
biggest threat on day one, they
also boast a lineup that resembles

suit after 'U'
denied FOIA
application
Request aimed to
obtain external audit
of Jenson case
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
The University receives over
500 Freedom of Information Act
requests each year, including sev-
eral from The Michigan Daily.
One request wasfrom 2002 alum
David Boyle in an attempt to obtain
the external audit conducted in the
fallout from the Stephen Jenson
case - in which University officials
waited six months to report that a
medieal resident was in possession
of chldpornography
Boyle was denied the FOIA
on the basis that the informa-
tion contained in the audit - con-
ducted by the law firm Latham &
Watkins - was protected under
attorney-client privilege. The
Michigan Daily, which had also
filed a FOIA request, was denied
on similar grounds.
After being denied the FOIA,
Boyle has filed alawsuitagainstthe
University challenging its claim
that the external audit is privileged
information.
The external audit was pre-
sented to the University's Board
of Regents and they summarized
their findings in a memo released
to the public.

$2.2 million project
will provide energy
for northern A2
By WILL GREENBERG
DailyStaffReporter
The installation of more solar
panels on North Campus is a
continuation of the University's
work to maximize the use of
environmental efficiency, the
only type of "going green" we
ever want to see in Ann Arbor.
The new panels will be locat-
ed on Fuller Road between
Bonisteel Boulevard and Beal
Avenue, according to a press
release. These panels will add to
the $2.2 million panels installed
on North Campus in 2012 on

Plymouth Road, which gener-
ated co-troversy that stemmed
from a lack of communication
between the University and the
Ann Arbor community.
They are part of a partner-
ship between the University
and DTE Energy, as part of its
SolarCurrents program, who is
funding the $1.5 million proj-
ect. The University will receive
$6,000 from DTE annually for
the next twenty years to cover
costs stemming from site main-
tenance.
The panels are expected to
produce approximately 240
kilowatts of solar power per
week. However this project is
not considered part of the Uni-
versity's goal for lowered emis-
sions by 2025 since all power
will be directed into the DTE

grid for commercial use by resi-
dents in northern Ann Arbor.
DTE is also placing kiosks on
North Campus, including one
in the Duderstadt Center, that
provide information in real time
about the energy generated by
the panels. Engineering courses
may incorporate data from these
panels in the future.
Andrew Berki, manager of the
University's Office of Campus
Sustainability, said the project
offers opportunity for the Uni-
versity in multiple areas.
"It's really a benefit in that it's
helping climate change from an
energy generation standpoint,"
Berki said, "But it's also further-
ing what we do here at the Uni-
versity from an education and
research perspective."

University study to examine
effects of medical marijuana

135,267 patients
legally registered
in Michigan
By ARIANA ASSAF
who has this position
The use of medical marijuana
as a pain reliever has long been of
high interest to activists, scientists
and policymakers. Appealing to
these interests, a new study at the
University will work to determine
the exact benefits medical mari-
juana may offer to those who suffer
from various medical afflictions.
Michigan, which legalized medi-
cal marijuana in 2008, has 135,267
patients registered to buy and use
the drug, according to the Michigan
Department of Licensing and Regu-
latoryAffairs. The state is one of the
18, along with Washington D.C., to
have legalized medical marijuana.
Researchers plan to identify 800
participants by approaching new
patients who have already made
the decision to become a registered
medical marijuana user in
Michigan. Interested participants
cannot contact the researchers.
The National Institute on
Drug Abuse donated $2.2 million
towards the fulfillment of this
project. The available funds will
be used to compensate participants
for their time, pay support staff and
support the infrastructure needed
to conduct such research.
Data collection will occur over
the span of two years, during
which the researchers will follow
up with participants about their
pain and health levels since
becoming registered medical
marijuana users. The follow-up

The more transparency the
better to avoid further incidents
from happening."

procedures will take place every
six months and will be conducted
by researchers in-person.
Mark Ilgen, assistant professor
of psychiatry at the Medical
School and leader of the study, said
although researchers had been
interested in carrying out this
kind of study for a while, writing
grants and scrutinizing the details
delayed the procedure.
However, now that plans to carry
out the study have been made, he
said his team was "very excited."
Some studies already exist to
determine the potential efficacy of
medical marijuana as a pain reliev-
er, but they are often similar to stud-
ies that examine other pain-relief
medications and do not take into
account long-term results or the
overall quality of life of participants.
"We plan to identify people
seeking a card for a first time, get
data on how they're functioning
and feeling when they show up to
the clinic (for the first time), and
track changes over two years,"
Ilgen said.
Unlike other studies, this
research methodology will not rely
on a control group, but will instead
identify subgroups of people by
clustering those with similar
characteristics- such as symptoms
and levels of functionality.
Given the lack of adequate
information and guidelines for
medical advisors when prescribing
medical marijuana, Ilgen said there
was all the more need for a "neutral
information" standard.
"Well-meaning providers
felt that there wasn't a lot of
data behind the use of medical
marijuana as a pain reliever," he
said. "(They found ) there aren't a
lot of clear guidelines about what
Fitzgerald said he shares Boyle's
belief that the situation requires
lucidity and accuracy, and said
he feels their actions reflect that.
Fitzgerald added that the
Division of Public Safety and
Security was created as a result
of the incident and is designed to
be preventative in nature.
Fitzgerald said this case has
been taken seriously and covered
extensively, the administration
has also created a website as a

advice treatment advisors should
give their patients."
Ilgen added that a concern for
the design of the study was the fact
that a lot of the data-such as pain
levels and how participants were
faring in life-were self-reported,
and hence subjective.
However, in future studies,
researchers will include more
objective standards such as level
of alcohol and other drug use, and
number of visits to the emergency
room to determine the effects of
medical marijuana both on patient
pain levels and overall functionality.
To add to the existing data,
researchers had considered includ-
ing reports by family members
regarding how participants were
doing as part of the data collection
but ultimately decided against it.
"With all these approaches there
are pros and cons, and one of the
clear trade offs is the cost to confi-
dentiality to involve anyone else in
means for the public to access
documents related to the case.
"The approach with this case
has been incredibly transparent,
and we've released document
after document after document,"
Fitzgerald said. "Many items
have been tied up in the federal
prosecution, but those were
also made public after (the case
ended)."
He added that the decision to
withhold the documents was in

the study," Ilgen said. "We wanted
to err on the side of respecting
participant confidentiality, (but)
there are a number of interesting
directions this research could go
in follow up studylike how medical
marijuana use affects a family."
Another idea was to test each
participant's marijuana to deter-
mine its potency, but Ilgen said
that liability concerns, combined
with the fact that participants
may be using different strains, led
researchers to decide against it.
The breadth of available data
and the lack of current information
regarding the advantages of
medical marijuana called for
extensive research, Ilgen said. The
research showed a unique potential
as compared to other projects.
"I've been e-mailed about patients
who are really passionate about this,
and that's never happened to me
before,"he said."Itreally does feelso
new and important."
order to protect people's privacy
and not reveal anyone's personal
information.
"As the primary University
spokesperson for this issue, I feel
the University has gone out of
its way to answer questions and
provide information regarding
this issue," Fitzgerald said.
"There's always been a wealth
of information available and
everything is in place for those
who want it."

Daily Sports Writer
Fifth-year senior Amanda
Eccleston won the Big Ten indoor
mile title in her first year on the
Michigan women's track and field
team. She then won the Big Ten
outdoor 1,500-meter run. So it
should come as no surprise that
in the NCAA East Preliminary
Rounds this past weekend in
Greensboro, N.C., Eccleston won
her heat in the 1,500-meter run,
setting a new personal-best time
of 4:17.75 to qualify for the NCAA
Outdoor Championships.
Eccleston was one of four
Wolverines to advance to the
NCAA championships, in what
willbe her last meet ofthe season.
Eccleston's record time was
even more impressive given the
initial sluggish pace of the heat,
which ran markedly slower in the
first 400 meters than the second
heat. Maintaining her position
in the middle of the pack for the
balance of the race, Eccleston
turned it on in the final two laps
to win the heat going away.
"I'm very excited to have the
opportunity to run [at Nationals],
and I'm definitely hoping to
make the final and go for an All-
American spot," Eccleston said.
"I don't really know what to
expect for Division I nationals
yet, but I think the way that I've
been racing, I have a really good
shot at making finals and placing
really high in the nation."
Eccleston knows athing or two
about competing on the national
stage, though. She spent the first
four years of her collegiate career
at Division II Hillsdale College,
where she was the Division II
national champion in the mile run
in2012.One yearlater,she returns
to the national championships,
this time at the highest level of
collegiate competition.
"The competition at Division I
is so much tougher,it's alittle hard
to compare, but I think doing so
well last year gives me confidence
that I can at leastget in a race and
be very competitive and go for
that top place," Eccleston said. "I
don't really know exactly how it's
going to play out, but I'm looking
forward to it."

Eccleston wasn't the only
Michigan athlete to thrive in the
1,500-meter run. Fellow senior
Rebecca Addison also qualified
for nationals in a personal-best
time of 4:15.81, to win her heat
with the top overall time.
"I was really excited, because I
knew to make it I would probably
have to run a PR (personal
record), so with it being a little
faster it helped to have so much
pushing in some sense," Addison
said. "I'm really excited to finally
make it to nationals, it's been a
goal of mine the whole year and
I've never made it to nationals
before."
Eccleston and Addison's
dueling first-place finishes in the
two heats continued a trend of
dominance this season for the
pair in the 1,500-meter run. The
pair came off first and third place
finishes in their last meet, the Big
Ten Outdoor Championships,
where they were key catalysts for
Michigan's overall fourth place
finish.
"That was so exciting to have
Michigan athletes win both heats,
it shows a lot about how hard we
work and especially how well
we are at finishing races strong,"
Eccleston said."I'm really excited
that we both made it, to be able
to train together the next couple
weeks and run together, so I
think that made it more special."
Eccleston and Addison were
the only Wolverines competing
in track events to qualify, but
they will be joined by a pair of
Michigan field athletes who
impressed as well.
On the first day of competition
Thursday, senior Erin Pendleton
qualified in the discus throw with
a season-best toss of 53.13 meters,
good for third overall. Then,
on Friday, redshirt junior Kiley
Tobel qualified in the pole vault,
clearing 4.10 meters to finish in
the top group of athletes.
The four Michigan athletes
will have a week and a half to
train and prep for the NCAA
Outdoor Championships, which
begin June 5 in Eugene, Ore.

"When you go to championships

a little bit of everything heading

around to help us do what we need
to do."
While the diversity of the
remaining five pleases Coach
LaPlante, it may present a
problem in this week's practice.
Traditionally, competition is the
ultimate motivator in practice;
sprinters race each other, distance
runners push each other through
the long workouts, and field
competitors are always looking
to be that day's champion. With
no one left to compete against,
LaPlante is looking for self-
motivation within his team.
"All year you've been sweating
it out with your teammates and
your buddies, and now those guys
are gone and it's just you and the
coach," LaPlante said. "It's an
adjustment to make, but I think
these guys can handle it."

BUZZ OFF!

Despite powerful
performances, ABC'S
series lacks velocity
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Daily Arts Writer
"Nashville" has always had a
Storytelling problem. In the first
few episodes of the ABC musical
aeries, everything
moved too fast; R
ven the pilot
iurned through Nashville
oo much story,
making it a stand-
alone sensation Wednesdays
with an unclear at10 p.m.
trajectory for ABC
things moving
orward. Then,
for long stretches of the season,
was like someone had pushed
9ause - the characters danced in
place while boring storylines got
pushed center stage and stronger
ones faded to the background. In its
inale, "Nashville" piles on the emo-

tional layers that trickle throughout
its freshman run. But in the end,
nothing much more happens than
the pilot signaled would happen;
cut away all the middle stuff and
you really wouldn't miss anything,
story-wise.
But "Nashville" isn't as plot-driv-
en as its premise would have you
believe. Though it's promoted as a
primetime soap about the rivalry
between aging country music leg-
end Rayna James (Connie Britton)
and the young and unstable bub-
blegum country princess Juliette
Barnes (Hayden Panettiere), under-
neath all the glistening musical
numbers is an earnest look at the
music industry and how it affects
families and relationships. It has
all the hallmarks of soapy drama,
but "Nashville" shines in its quieter
moments. On the typical soap, plot
drives everything. On "Nashville,"
the characters are in control.
The series frequently takes
seemingly cliche plot points and
injects them with depth. Creator
Callie Khouri - whose background
in film explains some of the pacing

issues - knew she wanted Juliette
to sleep with Deacon (Charles
Esten), the much older, longtime
friend and past lover of Rayna, in
the pilot, but didn't want it to seem
like just some skin-deep onscreen
hookup. Instead, there are all sorts
of motivations and emotions at play,
like Deacon's longing for a past
that's long gone and Juliette's self-
destructive mentality.
The finale similarly attempts to
carve more dimensions into pre-
dictable plots that are shallow on
paper, but with mixed success.
Deacon's downward spiral was

Councilmember Sally Peterson
(D-Ward 2) said communication
about the Fuller Road panels
went much smoother and created
fewer concerns among Ann Arbor
residents and business owners.
"I think since (the Plymouth
project) they've been much more
proactive in communicating their
intentions," Peterson said.
Peterson said two community
meetings have been held this
year between University and Ann
Arbor officials. The first was held
in February during which the
University apologized for the lack
of discussion on the Plymouth Road

project and announced the plans for
Fuller Road. The second meeting
was to alert the surrounding
neighborhood of the project.
"I think the meetings went
quite well," Berki said. "The
feedback that we've received
from the community on this staff
of the solar project has been very
positive."
Currently both Ann Arbor and
the University have their own
renewable energy projects but
Peterson says she would rather
they collaborate on green projects.
"The city and University are
just now looking for opportunities
to collaborate," Peterson said, "I
would say that might be one of
those areas where we could have
some very positive collaboration."

Even with the great character
work and powerful performances,
there's something a bit off-pitch
about the finale. It all comes back
to the lack of momentum, the lack
of real action. "Nashville" some-
times makes it seem like it's mov-

doing is dancing in place. Even the
two supposed-to-be shockers at

of anything.

$1.4 million surplus
to be worked into
2014 allotment
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor City Council
has approved the budget for the
2014 fiscal year and has released
a plan for budgeting in the 2015
fiscal year.
The budget, presented to the
council by City Administrator
Steve Powers, contains increases
to the number of full time
employees, expenditures on
social welfare programs and
other various city improvements
and maintenance projects.
With a 2.3 percent increase in
property tax revenue and a 4.4
percent increase in General Fund
revenues, the city has accrued a
$1.4 million budget surplus for
the 2014 fiscal year. Some of this
extra revenue is due to profits
from Ann Arbor's golf courses.

These surplus funds will be
allocated toward making one-
time improvements to facilities,
bettering financial services and
hiring more employees. After
several successive years of labor
cuts, the city will add eight full-
time equivalent jobs - including
four positions in Fire Services.
Despite this surplus, there is
a projected $1.6 million deficit
for the 2015 fiscal year due to an
increase in fixed costs.
Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) said this coming
deficit was not something that
she thought was in the city's best
interests.
On the other hand, Council-
member Chris Taylor (D-Ward
3) said he had confidence in
the city's financial status and
believed that it would be robust
in the coming years.
"The city has always presented
balanced budgets during the
course of the Great Recession
and has always been in great
fiscal health," Taylor said. "The
ability of the city to provide

desirable services has improved
as economic conditions have
improved."
Taylor said the need to cut
employees has "by and large
gone away."
Similar to Taylor, Powers
said the city had a positive fis-
cal outlook, adding that it was
the result of wise decisions that
helped to contain city expenses
and increase revenues.
However, Powers said it would
be best to contain and minimize
city spending and keep down
recurring expenditures.
"We are still in a position
where we need to restrain our
spending," Powers said.
However, for the coming fis-
cal year, there has been a 15
percent increase costs for the
pension system and 4.4 percent
increase in recurring annual
expenses.
Taylor said despite the chal-
lenge to fund the pensions of
retiring employees, the city
would meet its obligations.

PFlRF 1 THE E A Y
Repackag ed strategy
Obama counterterrorism policy shift is a mixed bag
Jn a major speech last Thursday, President Barack Obama outlined his
approach to the future of U.S. counterterrorism strategy, consisting of
"targeted action against terrorists, effective partnerships (and) diplo-
matic engagement and assistance." However, this strategy was overshad-
owed by his discussion of two longstanding institutions of the war on terror
- targeted strikes against terrorist suspects using remotely piloted drones
and the Guantanamo Bay detention center. While his speech was critical of
both these institutions and is a good starting point for the future of the war
on terror, the president's inability to close Gitmo and obstinate defense of
drone strikes is disappointing. The success of the president's new approach
depends in part on him placing pressure on Congress to give him the tools
he needs to close Gitmo, but also on scaling back the drone program.

A semo insurgen

In his speech, Obama claimed
that his preferred method of tar-
geted action against terrorists is
to capture them. However, his
actions over the past four and a
half years show an entirely dif-
ferent preference. Though details
are few, the government has used
drones to kill suspected terror-
ists in countries such as Yemen
and Pakistan. While Obama con-
tends that the program only goes
after those who "pose a continuing
and imminent threat against the
American people," his administra-
tion's definition of "imminent" has
been called into question before.
Some estimates of the number of
civilians killed by the strikes are
in the thousands, and the program
has been blamed for radicalizing
the next generation of terrorists,
even as it takes out the current
generation. The administration
should seriously consider ending

this program and seek other meth-
ods for combating terror organi-
zations that don't exacerbate the
future threat of terrorism.
In contrast to his discussion on
drones, Obama's evaluation of the
Guantanamo Bay situation was
quite accurate. At the moment,
transferring prisoners away from
the facility is virtually impossible
without Congressional approval
- even though some 86 detain-
ees have been cleared to return to
their home countries and secure
facilities exist in the U.S. for the
rest. Calls for its closure have
reappeared as over half of the
inmates have gone on a hunger
strike over the last few months
protesting their seemingly end-
less detention. Obama's point that
"(U.S.) allies won't cooperate with
us if they thinka terrorist will end
up atGitmo" reflects how the facil-
ity's continued operation doesn't

line up with his new strategy. Con-
gress must engage with Obama in
order to close the facility.
Throughout the speech, Obama
made it clear that terrorism is and
will remain a significant threat
to the U.S. His strategy's focus
on partnerships and diplomatic
engagement reflects the fact that
the country cannot hope to coun-
ter terrorist networks spread
across multiple countries with-
out the support and cooperation
of other countries. Moreover, his
proposal to eventually repeal the
authorization to use force passed
shortly after 9/11 indicates how
the war on terror has - for bet-
ter or worse - become more than
a reaction to an attack on the U.S.
With a few modifications in drone
use and Congress's cooperation,
Obama's strategy will be a work-
able blueprint for the future of
counterterrorism strategy.

Equality must go national

Franchise stays 'Fast' on lap six

Lin brings heart,
bravado to storied
action series
By MATT EASTON
Daily Arts Writer
"Fast & Furious 6" is family. For
young adults, the film series has
hung around in the background for
the greater part of their conscious
life, a comforting (or grating)
engine humming over their shoul-
ders. These adults might remember
the thrill of seeing the first film
in theaters, the pure joy of racing;
afterwards, they might have sped

down neighborhood hills on bikes,
issuing guttural revs and yelling
"nitro!" at the top of their lungs.
The moody teenage years came
next, and "Fast & Furious" lin-
gered, offering the same thing it
always has, yet receiving mockery
in place of idolatry. Drifting was
mentioned with a sneer, and Vin
Diesel suddenly had more in com-

to her adolescent daughter than
with a tough street racer. Our mov-

"Fast & Furious," like family, stuck
around even when we didn't want

it to.

And, looking at the franchise,
it's hard not to think in terms of
"decades." The opening credits
depict stylized scenes from the
previous five movies, ending in the
main characters, in nearly match-

sauntering toward the camera. Drive it like you stole it.

of movement,

but when there are multiple car
sequences interlaying with each
other, that's hardly a complaint.
Yet, it's in leaving the cars
behind where "Fast & Furious
6" truly succeeds. Tyrese Gibson
("Fast Five") and Ludacris ("Fast
Five") exchange more laugh-out-
loud dialogue than you'd find in an
average comedy, and the hand-to-
hand fight scenes are amazingly
original for a movie that shouldn't
even need to have them. "6" sur-
passes the classic brawl (Samoan
Thor v. Riddick would sell mil-
lions of tickets) between Johnson
and Diesel in "Five" - three times.
Twice in a London Tube scene
(which features the best female
fight this side of "Kill Bill"), and
once near the end, in an airplane
(of course).
"Fast & Furious 6" excels at
everything it attempts. Funnier
than most comedies, better than
any action film since "Fast Five,"
convincing enough in its char-
acterizations and surprisingly
tragic (knowing how Han's story
must end adds to its emotion), "6"
swaggers past the finish line. After
a decade of tinkering with the
engine, Lin and Diesel have cre-
ated a dominating, heartfelt vehi-
cle, which should carry this (dare
I say) storied world into the next
decade - here's to that.

Every so often my aggregation
of Tumblr blogs - my "dash-
board" or "dash" - fills with
death, thanks to
a blogger who
calls himself The

what was once a revolution and is
now a long, bloody civil war, fought
between the government forces of
Bashar al-Assad and a loosely orga-

The first few times those images
popped up I was almost sick. How
could anyone not be? I saw and con-
tinue to see Syrian opposition to
Assad as thoroughly legitimate and
I hope his rule ends - by whatever
means. However, I never expected
pictures of maimed and dismem-
bered children to show up on my

Station, brief, hilarious exchanges of
text and teasers for articles in vari-
ous publications, but I feel obligated
to keep following that blog. Doing
so has served as a daily reminder
that the peace I enjoy as a student in
beautiful Ann Arbor is more precious
than I've ever realized.
His blog has done more for me
than that, though. It has helped me
to realize that the only way to stop a
conflict like the one in Syria - apart
from one side's surrender or anni-
hilation - is a state's application of
geopolitical power. No amount of
blogging or sharing of gruesome pic-
tures will matter if some government
or another doesn't think ending the
conflict is in the national interest.
This is a departure from the ideal
that generations of Americans have
been taught - that each individual's
voice matters. My own generation has
expressed our voices online for much
of our lives and sharing the content
we create or speaking out about what
we find there is second nature to us.
In turn, these acts seem to carry with
them the expectation that someone
should be paying attention to what we
say - that somehow, the mere act of
expression deserves attention.
It's apparent how untrue this is in
how we've used the Internet far more

effectively for getting free music, net-
working and Kickstarting our favorite
projects than for stopping civil wars
and other conflict. The Internet and
its community of users just don't have
the power to affect the outcome of
the Syrian conflict. Even if we tried,
there's little chance that any peti-
tion or email sent to the White House
regarding the conflict would get
beyond some secretary's inbox. They
would probably give the message a
cursory once-over, shoving it in the
virtual trash alongside messages from
9/11 truthers and people who think
they'll be taken more seriously if their
entire email is in CAPS LOCK.
I never expected
this to show up
on my dash.
Granted, the reasons for this dis-
missal are obvious. With its vast
intelligence infrastructure, the
government should be far better
informed about the situation in Syria
than any single person. Like all other
pieces of national policy, there isn't
going to be a referendum on whether
or not the U.S. should arm the rebels.
And unless the conflict spills over
the Syrian border into U.S.-allied
Iraq, Israel or Turkey and a U.S.
troop deployment becomes possible,
expecting the American people to
respond en masse to a distant coun-
try's suffering is depressingly unreal-
istic. Who wants to think about some
conflict halfway across the world
when you could hop on Netflix and
watch the new season of Arrested
Development instead?
Trust me - Netflix will keep for a
while. For now, go find The Revolt-
ing Syrian online. Remind yourself
that there are important problems
in the world that deserve our atten-
tion, perhaps even more so than the
ones that plague this country. And if
you think I'm wrong - if your faith in
the power of the Internet knows no
bounds - realize that there's a whole
host of problems that online interac-
tion cannot address. It can mesh the
voices of hundreds of people from
dozens of countries into a virtual
choir and provide free college-level
courses to the masses, but for some
things - like ending a civil war - the
Internet is not enough.

n the U.S. today, the tide
is turning in support of
both marriage equality and
improved
rights for
the LGBT
community.
However -
as always - a
minority of
the country
is resisting JAMES
progress and BRENNAN
hampering
the
attainment of equality for all
Americans. In the last two years,
the number of states that allow
or will soon allow gay marriage
has doubled, with 12 states
and the District of Columbia
having passed marriage equality
statutes or amendments. As a
recent New York Times blog
pointed out, this number is
expected to increase, but only
for a short time. Historically,
some states have been extremely
resistant to social change,
meaning that even decades
after the vast majority of states
legalize gay marriage, there
will still be parts of the country
where all men and women are
not recognized equally under
the law.
The same situation played
out in the middle of the 20th
century, as civil rights for
African Americans passed in
the vast majority of states, but
remained untouched in most
of the South. Federal court
rulings helped to end a great
deal of discrimination at the
local and state level, but federal
statutes and a constitutional
amendment had to be passed to
stop some of the most egregious
violations of equal protection
under the law.
Though it may not be
possible to say with utter
certainty that Southern
states would have continued
discriminatory practices
without federal intervention,
there are a plethora of examples

in which former Confederate
states attempted to subvert
and challenge federal civil
rights laws that are now almost
universally accepted. It wasn't
until 1987 that the state of
Mississippi repealed its law
banning interracial marriage,
and until 1995 that it ratified
the 13th Amendment, banning
slavery. Even in 2012 - nearly
50 years after the Loving
v. Virginia case officially
made anti-miscegenation
laws like that in Mississippi
illegal - one in five Alabama
Republicans and more than one
in four Mississippi Republicans
believed interracial marriage
should be against the law.
This data doesn't even include
the multiple court cases
and legislative battles in the
south against federal anti-
discrimination laws.
Many parallels have been
drawn between the civil rights
movement and current fights
for LGBT equality, but the need
for federal intervention in both
situations is one of the most apt
of these comparisons. Though
early in a movement, a state-by-
state strategy is key in building
support, eventuallythe tide must
turn nationally. The current
Supreme Court cases dealing
with marriage equality - U.S.
v. Windsor and Hollingsworth
v. Perry - will likely be two
of the biggest first steps in a
national conversation about
gay rights, but litigation cannot
be the only aspect of this fight.
Federal legislation addressing
not only gay marriage, but also
discrimination in the workplace,
housing and other areas of life
must be proposed and eventually
passed in Congress.
When it comes to divisive
social issues like racial equality
and gay marriage, the U.S. has a
history of seeing certain groups
linger in the past as the rest of
the country moves forward.
Arguments against equal rights
for blacks would be heard as

simply another point of view,
even as recently as 30 years ago.
But in today's society, racism
is unacceptable and has no
legitimate place in the national
conversation. In a matter of
decades, the same will be true
for arguing against gay marriage
and LGBT equality. Some parts
of the country will continue to
be stuck in the past on LGBT
rights, but the vast majority of
Some states
have resisted
social change.
states will move forward.
The U.S. cannot maintain
itself as a true democracy when
certain citizens have full rights
in some places but not in others.
Even in my short lifetime,
I've spoken with black friends
who talk about being treated
differently in certain cities and
states because of their race.
Some have encountered people
who are simply rude, while
others have experienced full-on
hatred and a determination to
continue old ways in whatever
manner possible. No one could
say for sure, but it's highly likely
that most of the South - as well
as other parts of the country
-would have continied with
Jim Crow were it not for federal
legislation forcing progress.
Obviously, governments
cannot fully legislate morality
and equal treatment. However,
important action can be taken
to stop discrimination, and it's
our duty as citizens in a free
country to continue down the
road of progress - even if that
means dragging parts of the
country with us, kicking and
screaming the whole way,

SOLAR
From Page 1
Councilmember Sally Peterson
(D-Ward 2) said communication
about the Fuller Road panels
went much smoother and created
fewer concerns among Ann
Arbor residents and business
owners.

"I think since then (the
Plymouth project) they've
been much more proactive in
communicating their intentions,"
Peterson said.
Peterson said two community
meetings have been held this
year between University and Ann
Arbor officials. The first was held
in February during which the
University apologized for the lack
of discussion on the Plymouth

Road project and announced
the plans for Fuller Road. The
second meeting was to alert the
surrounding neighborhood of the
project.
"I think the meetings went
quite well," Berki said, "The
feedback that we've received
from the community on this staff
of the solar project has been very
positive."
Currently both Ann Arbor

and the University have their
own renewable energy projects
but Peterson says she would
rather they collaborate on green
projects.
"The city and University
are just now looking for
opportunities to collaborate,"
Peterson said, "I would say that
might be one of those areas where
we could have some very positive
collaboration."

BUDGET
From Page 3
"It will continue to be a
substantial (expense) and the
city will go forward and meet it,"
Taylor said.
Lumm said the city would
need to keep this issue in mind
in future contract negotiations.
"It is critical that in every
contract we negotiate that we
raise the issue and start to
address our pension offerings
going forward," Lumm said.
Powers added that there
would be more information
presented to the council
members on these long-term
obligations in the next quarter in
order to make informed future
budget decisions.
Alongwith thebudget, several
amendments were passed that
allocated and reallocated money
toward social welfare programs
- including $100,000 for the
Washtenaw Health initiatives,
$300,000 for affordable housing
initiatives, $4,500 for a senior
meal program - park funding
and city maintenance.
Another proposal to resume
the pickup of leaves on streets -
a service eliminated during the
recession - was proposed and
defeated because of high cost of
over $300,000 and its difficulty
to implement.
Proposals to increase police
funding in order to add three
full-time employees, through
elimination of three probation
officers, and a separate proposal
to increase police staffing by
one full time employee, through
eliminating employees in the
city attorney's office, were both
defeated by a margin of 6-5 and
9-2, respectively.
Taylor said the city didn't
need more money allocated
to safety services, as over 50
percent of the city's annual
budget was already allocated to
fundingthose services.
"We need a balanced
approach," Taylor said. "The
benefit of adding additional
officers does not away the
detriment by the offsetting cuts
needed to fund those officers."
Lumm, who proposed the
amendment to allocate three
more full-time positions to the
police department, said she was
disappointed with the outcome.
She didn't think the city was
prioritizing public safety as
much as it should.

Renovations
to CVS will
begin in July

CSG encourages
higher standards

Changes to include
new check-out
stations and small
health clinic
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
ManagingNewsEditor
After two years in business,
the South State Street CVS
Pharmacy will be undergoing
some minor renovations to add
new checkout stations and a
health clinic, MinuteClinic,
which can provide basic health
services.
CVS will begin the
renovations in July, carrying
them out at night when the store
is closed, and plans to complete
them before the end of the
summer.
The renovations are part
of a continued expansion of
commercial drug stores into the
downtown Ann Arbor area, as
Walgreens has signed a lease to
open in the former location of
Michigan Book and Supply in
2014.
CVS spokesperson Mike
DeAngelis said the store was
renovating to keep up with
customer demand.
"The business is growing
and we needed to add the
checkout stations to keep up
with the volume of business
that the store is experiencing,"
DeAngelis said.
In addition to the checkout
stations, the MinuteClinic
will have registered nurse
practitioners and physician

assistants to provide treatment
for minor injuries and illnesses,
administer shots and vaccines
and conduct physicals.
"The store is to serve
the University of Michigan
community," DeAngelis said.
"We are adding these features
to enhance our services."
Garry Turner, owner of The
Village Apothecary, said he
wasn't concerned about the
expansion of commercial drug
stores in downtown Ann Arbor.
He has owned his drug store
since 1994 and owns two others,
one in Jackson and another in
Flint.
"I don't think it will bother
me that much, I'll still be here,"
Turner said. "Revenue goes up
and it goes down."
Turner said the level of
personalized service that his
store provides would attract
customers, adding that his
patrons always see the same
faces when they shop.
"Unless you are really in love
with dealing with corporate
outfits and their whole line of
thinking, (I think) most people
would choose personalized
service," he said.
LSA senior Anusha Sharma
said she liked the idea of the
MinuteClinic's accessibility.
"I think it is a good idea,"
Sharma said. "It would be a
convenient way for people to get
immunized."
"I prefer the national chains,"
she added. "(They are) more
reputable and often have more
selection."

Parties stress
importance of
attendance and
participation
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
AND
GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporters
A highly contested Central
Student Government election in late
March saw allegations of campaign
violations followed by law suits,
as parties sought to secure the
presidential and vice presidential
seats. But to move forward from the
election politics, the 52 newly elected
legislative representatives must
harness their power in numbers to
fulfill their campaign promises and
implement positive change.
In a March interview preceding
the elections, LSA junior Michael
Dalton, a representative during
the 2012-13 term who ran with
youMICH, said he believed that
the second CSG assembly failed
in their outreach to new student
organizations. He added that
elected representatives could have
participated more actively.
"Every representative didn't
write up a resolution, every
representative didn't even have
something to say in announcements
arising, every representative
didn't even convey a message
to the assembly that says this is
what someone from my respective
college says their experience at the
University has been like," Dalton
explained.
Furthermore, Dalton said the
lack of communication between
elected representatives and the
student body was evident through
the few students who spoke during

the community concerns portion of
CSG assembly meetings.
"Students didn't really feel
that comfortable, I think, coming
to us about their student-related
problems," Dalton said.
He noted that student input
would have proved to be useful
when university administrators,
such as University Regent Mark
Bernstein (D-Ann Arbor), addressed
assembly meetings.
Dalton said the power of the
assembly and its ability to use
public pressure to influence
administrators was underestimated.
Representatives get especially
prompt responses when e-mailing
administrators and could hence
channel the voice of student
government to create bigger impact.
In the 2013 CSG election cycle,
youMICH and forUM proved to be
the two dominant parties in terms
of number of representatives and
garnered popular votes.
Public Policy junior Sam
Dickstein, forUM Communications
& Marketing Director, said
forUM implemented a stringent
interview process in choosing its
representatives for the 2013-14
assembly to ensure those selected
would be the most committed to
student government.
"We really looked for people
who had CSG experience, showed
a serious passion for CSG and also
were committed to coming to all
the meetings (including summer
assembly)," Dickstein said. "If a
representative is not showing up
and not holding up their end of
the bargain, we will not take that
lightly."
In reference to the faltering
attendance records of representatives
in the winter assembly, Dickstein
said he thought that forUM
representativeswould not be a reason
for unachieved quorum.

"We really expect to have all
the candidates show up often," he
said. "We're so far very happy how
the representatives have been with
their participation and we expect
that to continue."
Dickstein said individual forUM
candidates,whilecommittedtotheir
party's greater executive platforms,
would work to accomplish their
individual campaign promises
through their resolutions and the
backing of their party platform.
"What's really important to the
party, we think, is to make sure that
we follow through on campaign
promises," he said. "Whether that
is in line with the platforms that
everyone ran on, we hope to make
sure that those are seen through."
Out of over 100 elected
representatives in the CSG
assembly, 32 are members of
forUM. Resolutions introduced
and approved by all forUM
representatives would have a clear
majority in the house and would
therefore be passed regardless of
opposition from representatives
from other parties.
"We have a very strong majority
(of representatives) and we'll
have that continue throughout
the summer as well," Dickstein
said. "And so we see forUM being
a very strong force in CSG but we
understand that we're going to have
to work across party lines."
Business senior Michael Proppe,
CSG President, said he didn't
think party politics would impede
productivity. The multiple parties
merely served as a marketing tool
during elections and would not
cause a dissent within the house.
"I am confident that we will
(work together)," Proppe said.
"Once yougetelected your loyalty is
not so much to the party anymore as
it is to what you ran on and what is
the best for the studenthbody."
