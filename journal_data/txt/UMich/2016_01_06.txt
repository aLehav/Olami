Students express 

concerns over 

functionality, name 
of planned building 

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

A planned relocation of the 

Trotter Multicultural Center 
to Central Campus has gar-
nered mixed reactions from 
the 
University 
community 

ranging from excitement to 
apprehension. 

On Dec. 17, The University’s 

Board of Regents approved a 
proposal to relocatethe Trot-
ter Multicultural Center, cur-
rently located on Washtenaw 
Avenue, to State Street in an 
area behind Betsy Barbour and 
Helen 
Newberry 
Residence 

Halls on Central Campus.

In Winter 2014, the Black 

Student Union called for the 
relocation of Trotter as part 
of the #BBUM movement — a 

student-driven campaign shar-
ing the experiences of Black 
students on campus.

After the years of public 

discourse on the issue, many 
students lauded the approval, 
including Rackham student 
Austin McCoy. 

McCoy, a leader of Ann Arbor 

to Ferguson, a protest group 
advocating against police bru-
tality, said he welcomed the 
accessibility and visibility of 
the new location. He noted that 
replacing the current multicul-
tural center with a facility on 
Central Campus illustrates the 
importance of issues of inclu-
sion and equity. 

“I think students of color 

and some various underrep-
resented backgrounds need to 
have a space that’s more acces-
sible than on the margins of 
campus,” McCoy said. “I think 
Trotter’s 
current 
location 

actually symbolizes how stu-
dents feel marginalized within 
the University.”

While McCoy added that he

Engineering panel stresses 
faculty-student mentorship

Workshop features 
remarks from current 

graduate students, 

professor

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

A handful of engineering fac-

ulty members spent Tuesday 
morning in the Lurie Engineer-

ing Center the day before Winter 
Semester classes began participat-
ing in a program called “Working 
with Graduate Students”.

The event, held by the Center 

for Research on Learning and 
Teaching, aimed to give newly 
hired faculty a chance to learn 
how to interact with the Engineer-
ing graduate students they may be 
doing research with and mentor-
ing.

Though the event catered to 

new faculty, some of the attendees 

had been worked at the Univer-
sity for a few years. The program 
included a series of speakers, pan-
els and activities for the event’s 
participants.

Tershia Pinder-Grover, one of 

the event’s coordinators and Inter-
im Director at CRLT in Engineer-
ing, said the event was a great way 
for faculty to gain an appreciation 
for the complexities of being a 
mentor to students.

“Many of the faculty have come 

from a background where they’ve 

been the mentee, they’ve been the 
student, but they haven’t had as 
many opportunities to really think 
carefully and intentionally about 
how to mentor,” Pinder-Grover 
said.

Pinder-Grover said CRLT runs 

a series of events during the year 
to help acclimate faculty to their 
new roles.

“Our goals are to provide them 

with resources that are very rel-
evant for their first few years in

CSG reflects 
on first term, 
prepares for 

new initiatives
In sit-down with 

the Daily, assembly 
members discuss 
goals for winter term

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily News Editor

As Central Student Govern-

ment moves into the winter 
semester, its work in the fall 
includes both achievements and 
several campaign goals left short.

CSG President Cooper Charl-

ton, an LSA senior, began the fall 
semester focusing on the goals 
outlined on his Make Michigan 
campaign platform, the same 
ticketupon which former CSG 
President Bobby Dishell cam-
paigned last year.

Charlton and Vice President 

Steven Halperin, an LSA junior, 
campaigned on promises to make 
the University safe for students 
on and off campus, diversify the 
student population and create 

more cultural awareness. Make 
Michigan, as a party, promised 
to make headway on increasing 
convenience in campus transpor-
tation and increasing student-led 
participation initiatives.

Among the plans put into 

motion 
last 
semester, 
CSG 

amended the Statement of Stu-
dent Rights and Responsibilities, 
fought for the release of course 
evaluations, 
restructured 
the 

Student Organization Funding 
Commission and planned a cam-
paign to bring awareness of pre-
scription drug misuse on campus.

Statement of Student Rights 

and Responsibilities

In the first meeting of the fall 

semester, Charlton said increas-
ing awareness of the Statement of 
Student Rights and Responsibili-
ties was his main priority.

“The Statement Amendment 

process and sexual misconduct 
policy review are the things 
that go unnoticed and seek no 
applause, however are para-

Residents opposing deer 
cull pack Council meeting

A2 residents say 
resolution ignores 
safety regulations 

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Emotions ran high at Monday 

night’s City Council meeting 
in response to a planned deer 
cull in Ann Arbor, scheduled to 
begin this week.

The meeting was housed tem-

porarily in the chamber of the 
Washtenaw County Adminis-
tration Building due to renova-
tions in City Hall. Members of 
the public packed the room and 
spilled into the outlying hall-
way, many brandishing signs 
expressing their opposition to 
the city’s plan to kill a portion 
of Ann Arbor’s deer population.

In September, City Council 

approved a cull of up to 100 deer 
in response to concerns about 

the city’s growing deer popula-
tion. The move has prompted 
controversy over the past sever-
al months, culminating in legal 
action and several protests.

During the period for public 

comments at the meeting, some 
speakers accused Councilmem-
bers of irresponsibility, arguing 
that public opinion and safety 
regulations have been ignored 
on this issue.

Rakesh Khurana,

“house master” at Harvard

Lawsuit filed against A2 

over deer cull resolution 

Plaintiffs say 

management plan 
is unconsitutional, 
lacks legitimacy 

By MARLEE BREAKSTONE

Daily Staff Reporter

Ann Arbor residents opposing 

an impending deer cull are turn-
ing to the federal courts in an 
effort to halt the planned shoot-
ing of part of Ann Arbor’s deer 
population.

Ann Arbor Residents for Pub-

lic Safety, a group that has led 
several protests against the cull, 
filed a 97-page lawsuit against 
the city earlier this week.

A comprehensive list of city, 

state and federal officials the 
group considers responsible for 
the cull were named as respon-
dents to the suit, including Ann 
Arbor Mayor Chris Taylor and 
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R).

In September, City Council 

voted 8-1 to approve a deer cull 
as a way to manage the city’s 
growing deer population. The 
city has hired U.S. Department 
of Agriculture sharpshooters to 
kill up to 100 deer in response to 
complaints about the size of the 
deer population in the city.

The cull is scheduled to start 

as early as 4 p.m. Wednesday and 
will continue through January 
and February. Nearly two-doz-
en designated parks and nature 
areas will be closed from 4 p.m. 
to 7 a.m. on weekdays during the 
cull. The USDA intends to shoot 
the deer from inside vehicles. No 
University property is included 
in the designated sites for the 
cull.

“The Deer Management Plan 

is not supported by competent 
data, rationale or argument, and 
an urban cull such as that pro-
posed is unprecedented in Mich-
igan and the United States,” the 
suit argues. “The claim addition-
ally states the defendants have 
not established the existence of 
any legitimate deer overpopula-
tion problem in reality in Ann 
Arbor.”

Ann Arbor currently has 

about 15-20 deer per square mile, 
which the suit claims to be the 
amount recommended by Michi-
gan Natural Features Inventory 
biologists to promote the eco-
logical health and functioning of 
natural communities.

In an interview with the Daily 

in December, protestor Kath-
leen Amaru Titus said she was 
opposed to the cull because she 
felt the city was not working 
with the proper channels on the 

issue, such as the Humane Soci-
ety. She said it was important for 
people in the area to get involved 
in the politics of the situation.

“We felt there ought to be a 

vote. A lot of people don’t know 
about the deer cull,” Titus said. 
“It’s going to horrify a lot of peo-
ple. There might be some serious 
accidents and violence.”

Most of the plaintiffs are Ann 

Arbor residents from the north 
and east sides of the city. Some 
live close to parks and other 
areas scheduled for the cull.

In the lawsuit, they express 

concerns including fear for their, 
their neighbors and their pets 
safety and also “loss of enjoy-
ment and comfort of natural 
resources to which they are 
unquestionably entitled without 
impairment.”

The suit also notes that nei-

ther the United States, the state 
of Michigan or the city of Ann 
Arbor has publically stated that 
it would stand as financially 
responsible in the event of any 
injury, death or damage caused 
by the cull.

The city has expressed repeat-

edly that they feel the cull is safe 
for residents, and followed the 
correct process.

Councilmembers who voted 

for the cull have continued to

The Michigan Daily (ISSN 0745-967) is published Monday through Friday during the fall and winter terms by 

students at the University of Michigan. One copy is available free of charge to all readers. Additional copies may 

be picked up at the Daily’s office for $2. Subscriptions for fall term, starting in September, via U.S. mail are $110. 

Winter term (January through April) is $115, yearlong (September through April) is $195. University affiliates 

are subject to a reduced subscription rate. On-campus subscriptions for fall term are $35. Subscriptions must 

be prepaid. The Michigan Daily is a member of The Associated Press and The Associated Collegiate Press.

supported the administration’s 
decision, he emphasized that the 
driving force behind the change 
was student activism.

“For the University to follow 

through on that demand is a wel-
comed development, but I also 
think that this is an example of 
how student activism works,” 
McCoy said. “If it weren’t for the 
years of student activists, I don’t 
think this would’ve happened.”

Echoing McCoy’s sentiment, 

Elizabeth James, a Department 
of Afroamerican and African 
Studies program associate and 
adviser to the Black Student 
Union, expressed feelings of 
relief and joy in response to the 
approval. She also highlighted 
the symbolic nature of the relo-
cation, seeing it as representative 
of the University community’s 
commitment to diversity.

“By relocating the new Trot-

ter to the heart of central cam-
pus, we are saying that we 
want everyone to feel this is an 
inclusive campus and that this 
is a University that will provide 
a welcoming environment for 

all of our students, regardless 
of race, creed or color,” James 
wrote in an e-mail to the Daily.

However, while many com-

munity members commend the 
development, others have hesi-
tated in supporting the reloca-
tion.

Rackham student Pete Havi-

land-Eduah, vice president of 
Students of Color of Rackham, 
said though he is in favor of the 
relocation, he has reservations 
about how the project will be 
executed. 

“We’ll also see how the new 

space 
works 
functionally. 
I 

would hate to see it be a space 
that’s not necessarily as func-
tional for what it was meant to 
serve,” Haviland-Eduah said. 
“With any type of move, there’s 
always room for negative impact 
to happen, and I hope that’s min-
imized if it exists at all.”

In recent months, other stu-

dents have voiced concerns over 
the relocation of Trotter as well. 
During a September forum at 
Trotter, Rackham student Asya 
Harrison, secretary of Students 
of Color of Rackham, told E. 
Royster Harper, the University’s 
vice president for student life, 
that moving the center to Cen-

tral Campus would threaten its 
quiet atmosphere and separation 
from the stresses of classes and 
schoolwork.

At the meeting, LSA senior 

Bree Sullivan expressed unease 
regarding the move as well, 
highlighting the history and 
importance of the current build-
ing. She noted that the facility 
has served as a home for under-
represented minorities, and she 
worried that the space may not 
feel as safe on Central Campus.

“This is a lot of history, this 

building,” she said. “I want it, 
and I want future generations to 
have it.”

Former BSU Treasurer Rob-

ert Greenfield said he hopes the 
new center will have designated 
spaces for Black students on 
campus as well as students of 
other identities.

“I really hope they don’t mini-

mize the identities of other cul-
tures,” Greenfield said.

He added that he hopes the 

new multicultural center will be 
named after someone who is rep-
resentative of the ongoing cam-
pus struggle to improve diversity 
and inclusion.

“Already 
on 
campus 
we 

have a lot of buildings that are 
named after a lot of people who, 
although their accomplishments 
with regards to the University 
were great, were very racist 
people,” he said. “I don’t want 
it to be named after a past presi-
dent of the University from the 
late 1800s. I want it to be named 
after someone that’s representa-
tive of this newfound struggle 
that minority students have on 
campus.”

Regardless of the mixed feel-

ings surrounding the move, for 
some, the relocation of Trotter 
signifies the beginning of a new 
chapter at the University that 
will affect future Wolverines. 
Kinesiology senior Cap Kend-
all, BSU speaker, said she was 
pleased with the relocation of 
the Trotter center despite the 
fact that she won’t be able to take 
advantage of the new center her-
self.

“Though I won’t be here to 

experience it, I am comforted 
with the notion that countless 
numbers of my peers and I have 
done something that I hope will 
change the experience of genera-
tions to come,” Kendall said.

Sanzotta, a plaintiff in a law-
suit filed earlier this month 
by Ann Arbor Residents for 
Public Safety against the city 
to halt the cull, expressed her 
frustration with the council’s 
decision to move forward.

“I see you don’t care much 

about facts, or public safety,” 
Sanzotta said. “Our council 
has been bought and sold — 
cheaply.”

Barry Powers, the attor-

ney representing Ann Arbor 
Residents for Public Safety, 
referred to the lawsuit in an 
especially tense exchange 
during 
which 
he 
moved 

beyond the area given to 
public speakers, approaching 
council. 

“If you start this cull in 

the face of the Constitu-
tion, you’re all violating your 
oaths of office,” Powers said.

When 
Councilmember 

Sabra Briere (D–Ward 1) 
requested that Powers return 
to the podium as he deliv-
ered his speech he refused, 
stating the room belonged to 
the public, and was met with 
applause from the crowd.

“What do we want? Stop 

the Shoot!” the crowd chant-
ed between each speaker. 
“When do we want it? Now!”

Other residents speaking 

during public commentary 
used less pointed rhetoric, 
but nonetheless questioned 
the need for the cull and said 
their concerns for public 
safety were not being fully 
addressed.

Ann Arbor resident Ellen 

Rowe told the council that 
although deer are an occa-
sional nuisance in her back-
yard, they are integral to Ann 
Arbor’s habitat.

“The idea that City Coun-

cil could overturn firearm 
laws behind closed doors 
without 
citizen 
input 
is 

unconscionable, as is the 
short 
turnaround 
time 

between the announcement 
of park closing plans and its 
implementation,” she said.

“Ann Arbor should be a 

leader in developing non-
lethal means of controlling 
nuisance deer, and while it 
may take money and several 
years to create such a plan, it 
would set standards and pro-
tocols around the country,” 
she added.

In response to the con-

cerns, Briere pointed out 
measures the city has taken, 
including the distribution 
of postcards to residents 
near where the cull would 
be active, modifications to 
school bus routes to keep 
schoolchildren away from 
culling areas, and the use of 
GPS by cull shooters to verify 
a 450-foot safety radius from 
all residential properties.

The cull is currently slated 

to begin Wednesday, barring 
any legal action stemming 
from the lawsuit filed earlier 
this week.

The ADA calls for the 

reassignment of current faculty and 
staff members to a position of equal 
merit when a disability inhibits 
their job performance.

In the Record, Laurita Thomas, 

associate vice president for 
Human Resources, said a qualified 
employee does not need to compete 
 

as heavily with other applicants for 
an open position if the transfer is a 
result of disability.

State of emergency 
declared in Flint

According to the Detroit 

Free Press, Gov. Rick Snyer 
(R–Mich.) declared a state of 
emergency in Flint and Genesee 
County on Tuesday due to Flint’s 
contaminated drinking water.

An investigation into the 

contamination led by the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office and the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
was also confirmed. 

In 2014, excess lead 

contaminated Flint’s drinking 
water following its supply from 
Lake Huron to the Flint River. The 
pollution rose lead levels in affected 
children, which has the potential to 
interrupt brain development.

According to the release, Snyder 

is working with the Flint Water 
Advisory Task Force to develop 
short- and long-term plans to 
restore clean water to the area. 

Bill signed 
eliminating straight-
ticket voting

Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill 

Jan. 5 to eliminate straight-ticket 
voting in which voters can select 
one box on a ballot to vote for all 
candidates from a single political 
party, the Detroit Free Press 
reported. 

To account for the possibility of 

slower lines at the polls, Snyder also 
pushed for the state Senate to pass 
a bill allowing no-reason absentee 
ballots. Republicans in the state 
Senate voted to break the tie-bar 
linking the measure in December 
with the elimination of straight-
ticket voting.

However, the Free Press 

reported that Republicans added 
a $5 million appropriation to the 
bill recently which will allow 
for more voting equipment. The 
appropriation is intended to 
accomodate the longer and slower 
lines at the polls.

Obama calls for 
action on gun 
control

During an emotional live 

address from the White House on 
Tuesday, President Obama shared 
his executive actions to reduce gun 
violence. Mark Barden, whose son 
died in the Sandy Hook Elementary 
shooting, introduced the president.

NPR outlined the plan’s four 

main points.

Obama’s plan requires all 

firearm vendors to possess a license 
and to conduct background checks 
before sales. 

The plan makes it possible 

for states to share information 
about individuals banned from 
purchasing guns due to mental 
health issues — $500 million will be 
allocated to increase mental health 
care access. 

It also improves enforcement 

of existing gun laws and adds 
200 new agents to the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives. 

Finally, the plan encourages 

research in gun safety technology 
conducted by the Departments of 
Defense, Justice and Homeland 
Security.

the college,” Pinder-Grover said. 
“It helps faculty identify, ‘Where 
do I go if I need more informa-
tion?’”

Engineering Prof. Jennifer 

Linderman, associate dean for 
graduate education, gave a pre-
sentation to the attendees about 
graduate programs at the Uni-
versity and the students in the 
College of Engineering.

Linderman said one of the 

many attractive features of 
the College of Engineering is 
the allocation of funding for 
research through the completion 
of a student’s program. She said 
though many faculty members 
are unsettled by the thought of 
not having the funding for their 
graduate student researchers, 
the University has the resources 
to assist with these concerns.

“The funding is put togeth-

er 
through 
grants, 
internal 

and external fellowships, GSI 
appointments,” Linderman said. 
“An important point to make 
here is your department has 
made the commitment for fund-
ing, so if worse comes to worst, 
you can go to your department 
for help.”

The event also featured a stu-

dent panel of Rackham doctoral 
students in the College of Engi-
neering who discussed their 
experiences researching at the 
University. They detailed their 
struggles and successes of being 
a graduate students and how 
their mentors have helped them. 
All were researching with a fac-
ulty members at the University.

Many of the faculty members 

said they were concerned with 
recruiting and matching with 
graduate students for research 
projects, citing student’s prefer-
ences to work with tenured and 
senior professors. 

In response, one student 

said when choosing a profes-
sor to work with, she cared 
more about their personal-
ity and the conversation she 

could have with the professor.

The panel also spoke about 

faculty communication with 
students and the importance 
of checking in. The final part 
of the meeting was led by 
Mentoring Others Results in 
Excellence, a committee of 
faculty within the Rackham 
Graduate School that assist 
faculty and students with 
mentoring.

Engineering 
Prof. 
Steve 

Skerlos said many difference 
challenges can arise in men-
toring a student.

“Mentorship implies some-

thing transformational on the 
part of the mentee,” Skerlos said. 
“Something that is guiding them 
along their way to a new profes-
sional career. That’s a lot more 
than advising.”

Skerlos said the difficulties of 

mentoring include mismatching 
goals, unrealistic expectations, 
conflicting 
personalities 
and 

styles, unreliability and compet-
ing responsibilities.

“There’s a huge variability 

in mentoring norms on cam-
pus,” Skerlos said. “The MORE 
committee works across the 
University and within the 
committee itself; there are 
variable dimensions of vari-
ability with mentoring.”

One of the faculty members 

in attendance, Assistant Engi-
neering Prof. Mosharaf Chow-
dhury, said the event gave him 
ideas about how to advise stu-
dents. 

“I have my views on advis-

ing based on my experience 
and the way I interacted with 
my advisor,” he said. “This 
gave me some more view-
points on how other people 
look at it.”

Chowdhury said his biggest 

takeaway from the program 
was learning about how to set 
expectations for students.

“I would think that all the 

students always have similar 
expectations and will always 
be in sync, but that’s not 
always the case,” Chowdhury 
said.

loss in elderly populations. 
It manifests in two forms: 
the dry type, where there is 
occasional death of certain 
regions in the retina, and the 
wet type, where retina hemor-
rhage occurs due to the forma-
tion of defective blood vessels 
in the eye. Currently affecting 
30-50 million seniors world-
wide, the prevalence of AMD 
is expected to rise as lifespans 
lengthen and populations age.

Mohammad Othman, Kel-

logg Eye Center Research sci-
entist involved in the project, 
said AMD is a complex disease 
caused by multiple genetic 
and environmental factors.

“AMD is a very complex 

disease; there is no particu-
lar gene that accounts for the 
whole disease,” Othman said. 
“It is caused by a contribution 
of several genes that might be 
altered because of variants 
that are present in the genes.”

Also involved in the project 

was Kari Branham, assistant 
research scientist and genetic 
counselor at the Inherited 
Retinal Dystrophy Clinic, said 
the research would help com-
bat the disease more effec-
tively.

“If you know what you 

are fighting against — what 
is it that causes people to 
get 
infected, 
and 
if 
you 

can 
understand 
more 

about 
the 
genetic 
causes 

and background, then that 
information can be used for 
the 
development 
of 
more 

effective 
medications 
and 

preventions for individuals,” 
she said.

The 
genome 
consortium 

collaborated 
with 
26 

research institutions for the 
experiment. The University’s 
role stemmed from a grant 
secured 
by 
Biostatistics 

Prof. Goncalo Abecasis to 
conduct genotyping of 43,000 
individuals from the National 
Eye Institute.

The 
consortium 
aimed 

to learn more about disease 
development and pathology, 
according to Lars Fritsche, 
research investigator at the 
Department of Biostatistics.

“The aim of the experiment 

was to better characterize the 
genetics of known AMD risk 
loci and to find new risk loci,” 
he said.

Risk loci are regions of 

the human genome that may 
affect the risk of disease.

“In this experiment, we 

jointly 
analyzed 
millions 

of genetic variants in over 
16,000 individuals with AMD 
and 
compared 
them 
with 

almost 18,000 control indi-
viduals. We were able to use 
a special genotyping platform 
that allowed us to analyze 
common as well as very rare 
genetic variants in our case 
control study.”

Researchers 
said 
the 

unprecedented size of the 
study allowed them to identify 
these rare variants that typi-
cally occur at low frequencies.

The 
University’s 

multidisciplinary team was 

comprised of faculty members, 
graduate 
and 
doctoral 

students from the Kellogg Eye 
Center and Department of 
Biostatistics. The eye center 
specialized 
primarily 
in 

sample collection, while the 
biostatisticians analyze the 
data. 

Although the experiment 

only began in 2012, the collab-
orative working relationship 
between the two departments 
is more than a decade old. 

Othman said the partner-

ship between the biostatistics 
and ophthalmology depart-
ments was important in the 
collection of samples for the 
experiment.

“Our work in this integrat-

ed department involves clini-
cal and basic research that 
goes on at the same time,” 
he said. “We have over the 
years collected and recruited 
almost 1500 individuals who 
have AMD for controls.”

In addition to contributing 

samples, the team also played 
a major role in the consor-
tium’s data analyses. 

“We generated several tera-

bytes of raw data and their 
analyses took many months, 
in some cases, up to 10 CPU 
years,” Frtsche said. “Conse-
quently most of the presented 
analyses were only doable by 
analysis teams with sufficient 
computational resources and 
expertise, in this case, the 
University of Michigan and 
the University of Regensburg 
(Germany).”

The team said their success 

stemmed from institutional 
support, the willingness on 
the part of patients and con-
trols to participate in the 
experiment and, most impor-
tantly, the effectiveness of the 
international consortium. 

Branham lauded the discov-

ery as a feat of collaboration 
between the 26 participating 
institutions.

“It is a major accomplish-

ment to have so many scien-
tific institutions, each used 
to leading, working together 
to put differences aside and 
make this happen,” she said.

For those involved, collabo-

ration is also key in moving 
forward with the research. 
University 
researchers 
are 

currently involved in a follow-
up genome sequencing study 
involving the National Eye 
Institute and University of 
Pennsylvania. Given that only 
6,000 out of 43,000 individual 
samples in this discovery were 
of non-European background, 
there are also ongoing efforts 
to expand sample collection 
globally, Othman said.

He added that he is opti-

mistic that the amount of 
research underway will lead 
to improved treatments and 
solutions.

“The consortium is a reflec-

tion of the desire and drive to 
study AMD,” he said. “In the 
past, the issue of treatment 
wasn’t even addressed. Now 
we can see that there is hope, 
real hope for individuals with 
this condition. They know 
that there is something going 
on.”

students,” Charlton wrote in an 
e-mail interview.

Charlton said in the e-mail 

the Statement amendment pro-
cess is the method by which 
students defend their rights 
and determine the constraints 
on their behavior. The State-
ment is amended every several 
years by the University — CSG, 
along with the Senate Advisory 
Committee on Undergraduate 
Affairs and the administration, 
are the three groups that can 
propose amendments.

Seven 
amendments 
were 

proposed during the first term 
of CSG, some of which were 
aimed toward improving the 
amendment process and one 
of which targeted improving 
student awareness of the State-
ment. All were drafted and pro-
posed by CSG and heralded by 
Public Policy sophomore Jacob 
Pearlman, CSG General Coun-
cil. The amendments will not 
be final until University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel approves 
them; he is expected to consider 

changes to the Statement later 
this year.

Sexual Assault Reform
The misconduct feedback 

process is a product of students 
looking inwardly at the causes 
of sexual assault and discover-
ing a problem, Charlton wrote. 
He said CSG remains steadfast 
in its dedication to eradicating 
sexual assault on campus.

“We have advocated for 

students and will have begun 
the institutional and cultural 
changes needed to protect stu-
dents,” Charlton wrote.

CSG held round tables in an 

attempt to increase conversa-
tion about sexual assault on 
campus.

Gameday dining
In September, CSG approved 

funding for a new program to 
open dining halls earlier on 
game days. The pilot program 
initially cost Michigan Din-
ing more than anticipated, and 
CSG provided $10,000 in order 
to sustain the project.

Pearlman said the 
initiative helped tens of 

thousands of students “stay

defend their decision to hire 
sharpshooters, as well as 
the public process that led 
up to the cull, which along 
with the lawsuit have also 
prompted recall petitions to 
be filed against members of 
Council.

Among the plaintiffs in 

the suit representing Ann 
Arbor Residents for Public 
Safety include Ann Arbor 
resident Sabra Sanzotta, who 
filed a petition in Decem-
ber to recall councilmember 
Kirk Westphal (D-Ward 2) 
for his support of the cull.

At the hearing to deter-

mine the legitimacy of the 
recall 
petition, 
Westphal 

said claims of the cull being 
unnecessary and high-risk 
cited in Sanzotta’s petition 
were overstated.

“It has become clear to me 

over the last couple of years 
that the language is patently 
false,” Westphal said. “I take 
issue with the notion that 
there is danger (with the 
cull).”

W

hen she was 10 or so, my little 
sister received some of the worst 
advice of her life. It was written 

in the comments section 
of her fifth-grade report 
card underneath the part 
that graded her behavior 
in class. I can’t remember 
exactly what the grade 
was grading — probably 
something 
meaningless 

like hyperactivity — but 
I do remember that she 
had received her first “N” 
for “needs work,” with 
the suggestion that she 
“ask fewer questions.” I 
remember her sitting in our kitchen sobbing 
to our parents about, for the first time ever, 
getting something less than straight “Os” (for 
outstanding). She was miserable. And now, on 
behalf of my little sister almost 11 years later, 
I want to take a moment to call out you, Mrs. 
Michnick, for giving utterly terrible advice to a 
young learner. 

Though I never received this damning cri-

tique myself, it very well could have been writ-
ten on my report card, too. Just like my little 
sister, I love asking questions, and in elemen-
tary school, I never had any shame about it. 
Looking back, I can see now how my enthu-
siasm could have come across as borderline 
obnoxious — I also received an “N” from Mrs. 
Michnick with a similar suggestion to calm 
down. It’s true that in class, I would bounce in 
my seat with my small legs tucked underneath 
me, almost like a bird perched on a branch so 
my hand would reach slightly higher than my 
classmates’ and be more visible to the teacher. I 
knew I was over-eager, but in my mind, staying 
quiet simply didn’t make sense. Not because I 
liked to hear my own voice or because I wanted 
to prove that I was smarter than my peers. I just 
knew I loved to learn and asking questions was 
a sure way to do so. 

As I got older, I (thankfully) got a better grasp 

on the etiquette of asking questions in the class-
room. I understood that simply raising a hand 
wasn’t quite as unobtrusive as I had thought 
and that not all questions should be asked in 
front of the class. But perhaps most important-
ly, I gained a newfound sense of urgency and 
assertiveness in my inquiries. I began to ask 
questions that pushed beyond clarification. I 
became more skeptical, stopped blindly accept-
ing all the material taught to me as unequivo-
cally true, and began directly addressing 
material I found troubling or inconsistent. In 
my unapologetic quest for knowledge, I eventu-
ally found that the subject in which I had the 
most questions — compelling ones that would 
follow me outside the classroom and stay with 
me, gnawing until I could begin to search for 
some semblance of an answer — was history.

I understood that lobbying too many critical 

questions in front of the class could be seen as 
an affront to my teacher’s credibility, so I saved 
my bravest questions for outside the classroom. 
Throughout middle school, I would visit my 
favorite history teachers during my lunch 

period to ask more exploratory questions that I 
had jotted down in my notebook earlier in class. 
In seventh-grade world history, I asked about 
the Incans’ ability to develop a complex society 
without the wheel. In eighth-grade U.S. history, 
I questioned Thomas Jefferson’s inconsistency 
as a slave owner who supposedly believed “all 
men are created equal.” By the end of middle 
school, I realized that studying history does not 
mean memorizing a rigid linear narrative com-
posed of names, numbers and dates. Instead, I 
realized studying history means asking ques-
tions — particularly thoughtful criticisms of the 
past — and then devouring as many sources as 
possible to weave together a plausible answer. 
By the time I graduated middle school, I knew 
I would study history in college because it 
allowed me to ask as many questions as I wanted. 

But after I entered high school, something 

changed. To be sure, I still asked questions 
— just not as many as I used to, and the fierce 
unapologetic nature in which I used to inquire 
had faded. Maybe it was part of growing up, 
of becoming more self-conscious and insecure 
of my nerdy status in the eyes of my peers. 
Whatever it was, it fundamentally affected 
my confidence in the classroom, and I began 
to apologize. I apologized because I felt like I 
was interrupting and drawing unnecessary 
attention to myself. I apologized because my 
voice was too quiet or too loud, or because I 
thought my question was stupid. Sometimes, I 
would even start a question with, “I know this 
is dumb, but…”

I know I’m not the only woman who does 

it, and this tick, though innocuous on the sur-
face, reflects deeper feminine insecurities and 
feelings of inferiority. An unnecessary apology 
before a question immediately undermines the 
validity of the question before it has even been 
asked and surely impacts young women’s abili-
ties to be assertive both inside and outside the 
classroom.

I knew that apologizing before asking ques-

tions was not a natural behavior for me, but a 
learned one. However, I continued to apologize 
my way out of the classroom until one of my 
favorite history professors abruptly drew my 
attention to the habit this past semester. On the 
first day of school, after raising my hand and 
inevitably beginning with “Sorry,” she sharp-
ly cut me off in front of the whole class and 
demanded that I ask the question again — this 
time, sans apology. My face burned, but I knew 
she was completely right.

As I enter my last semester at Michigan, I’m 

pledging to try as hard as I can to stop apolo-
gizing before asking a question and to work on 
rebuilding my confidence in the classroom to 
what it was before I hit puberty. After all, ask-
ing questions is the best (and only) way to learn.

Before I walk into the first day of class, I’ll 

remind myself of a piece of good advice doled 
out by Mr. Melendez, the other fifth-grade 
teacher who taught alongside Mrs. Michnick: 
“There are no stupid questions. Just stupid peo-
ple who don’t ask questions.”

Keep asking questions

Reading to read

F

all semester of sophomore 
year, I was feeling pretty 
good about how things were 

going. I had finally finished my first 
round of required art studios, and 
had moved on to elective academics 
on 
Central 

Campus, a totally 
new world. I was 
both 
enthused 

and unsure about 
the 
workload, 

but ready to roll 
with it.

Then, 
at 
a 

mass 
meeting 

sometime in the 
first or second 
week of classes, 
I mentioned all 
the reading I had been assigned to 
a girl just starting her junior year. 
“It’s so interesting,” I told her, 
and meant it. She responded in 
kind, and then said in an off-hand 
way how she skimmed those very 
reading assignments I was just 
learning to love.

I tried not to show it, but I was 

both shocked and disappointed 
by 
her 
words. 
To 
hear 
an 

upperclassman, a student with 
a whole year more experience 
than me, dismissing her assigned 
reading so easily — it stung, 
especially since I’d made my mind 
up well before that conversation to 
read everything that was set before 
me, at least to the best of my ability. 
It hadn’t been a decision so much 
as it was a lifestyle choice — simply 
who I am. Reading — anything and 
everything — is just something I do. 
From the backs of snack packages 
to the copyright pages of books, I 
linger. I look. I do more than flip 
past the words to take in a general 
sense of their message. So when I 
walked away from that conversation 
sophomore year, I took it as a sort of 

dare. Skim, me? Hardly. I was going 
to ready everything I was given, 
word for word.

In a 2013 USA Today College 

article, 
Princeton 
undergrad 

Prianka Misra shares a similar 
stance toward reading. “I struggled 
with the idea of reading insincerely,” 
she says in the interview. “I actually 
want to be able to understand … 
but when you’re skimming you 
can’t really do that. You’re really 
just looking at the core points of 
an article and not really taking a 
greater in-depth look.”

To be fair, the workload of a 

200-level course at Princeton is 
probably a bit different than what 
I’ve 
experienced 
in 
200-level 

courses here at Michigan. I’m not 
sure I could read 200 pages for a 
class each week, word-for-word 
and diagram-for-diagram, the way 
Misra does. And even she admits 
that after a couple of years, the 
novelty she found in that kind of 
work ethic has started wearing 
off. “I can’t really afford to try to 
analyze a point if we’re not going 
to spend more than 10 minutes on 
it [in class],” she says. However, 
in favor of doing a full read, she 
believes “there is value to being 
able to summarize something, but 
there is also value to nitpicking and 
finding the small points you really 
take issue with or keenly going over 
each and every part of something 
for 
a 
more 
comprehensive 

understanding.”

Now a junior myself, I’m of 

the same mindset I was in at the 
beginning 
of 
sophomore 
year, 

but with a few more semesters of 
reading all the readings behind me. 
A couple of times, I even went so far 
as to continue reading from a book 
outside of class, simply because it 
was too interesting to put down 
until I reached the end. I’m not 

the kind of person who highlights 
passages or pauses to write out 
chapter summaries once I’m done 
with them and, unlike Misra, I 
don’t try to analyze the text as I 
go. But for the most part, I enjoy 
the process of reading, and what I 
can’t understand is when people 
simply don’t read. Not for classes, 
not for pleasure — among my 
friends and peers, many shirk the 
effort it takes to open the pages of 
a book and fall into the world held 
in place between them. This, to me, 
is crazy. For me, reading is what 
makes life interesting, and it never 
ends — there’s no shortage of new 
bestsellers, books made famous by 
their movie adaptations, and, oh 
yeah, assigned academic texts to 
lose myself in.

I’ll be the first to admit that 

sometimes doing the reading can be 
a little long-winded — sometimes 
it drags. Once in a while, other 
tasks call my name just a little too 
loudly to be ignored in favor of the 
reading I’ve been given. But what I 
love about reading these assigned 
pieces is that the time I spend on 
the task never feels wasted. Sure, 
sometimes I disagree with what an 
author’s saying, but isn’t that also a 
part of college — for our eyes to be 
opened up to new opinions? If so, 
this is one of the places I find it — 
chipping away at my reading in big 
chunks or little-by-little, on the 
bus, over meals, between classes. 
There’s nothing quite as satisfying 
as checking off each assigned 
chapter on my syllabus. And there’s 
no feeling quite like curling up 
with a good book — assigned or 
otherwise.

Monetizing Detroit’s culture

T

he day after Christmas, I 
took a trip with a couple 
of 
friends 
to 
Midtown 

in Detroit. We spent an hour at 
the 
Detroit 

Historical 
Museum 
— 

worth a visit, I 
should 
add 
— 

and 
when 
we 

finished walking 
through the late 
19th 
century 

replica town on 
the 
basement 

floor, we drove 
over to Traffic 
Jam and Snug for 
lunch.

Located on Second and Canfield 

streets in Cass Corridor, Traf-
fic Jam and Snug sits next to sev-
eral new stores and across from a 
crowded parking lot. These stores 
include Shinola, the Detroit-based 
watch and leather company, and 
Third Man Records, the Jack 
White-owned record store that 
opened in November.

In all respects, both Shinola and 

Third Man Records are destination 
stores; the carefully designed dis-
plays, good music and overall cool 
vibe makes them worth the 45-min-
ute drive from home. But it wasn’t 
only the physical products (which 
at Shinola were well out of my bud-
get) and the smell of incense waft-
ing through Third Man Records 
that struck me as special or unique, 
though they are. It’s that both stores, 
aside from being saturated with an 
overwhelmingly white clientele — a 
topic for a different, serious conver-
sation — appear committed to local 
manufacturing. That’s something 
you don’t see every day.

Shinola is in the middle of build-

ing a watch-dial factory, which 
when finished, will be visible to 
shoppers through a transparent 
window as they walk from the mid-
dle to the back of the store.

Tucked in the back of Third 

Man, shoppers will soon look 
onto a 10,000-square-foot vinyl 
record press which will manufac-
ture records 24/7 for artists and 

bands signed with the label as well 
as other local acts. Right now, the 
space is effectively empty, but ide-
ally by the middle of this year, eight 
presses imported from Germany 
will be operating and, according to 
Third Man co-founder Ben Black-
well, teaching the public — or at 
least those who walk through the 
building — that “all this stuff is alive 
and well.” This stuff meaning vinyl.

Of course, this isn’t the perfect 

story of homegrown, authentic 
Detroit manufacturing. Shinola was 
recently questioned by the Federal 
Trade Commission for the “Built in 
Detroit” mark on its watches. Why? 
Because even though it is accurate 
the watches are assembled with-
in the city limits of Detroit, none 
of the parts are manufactured in 
America. Because they come from 
Switzerland, Thailand and China, 
Shinola could be violating the FTC 
requirement saying “all or virtually 
all” parts must be manufactured 
in the United States in order for 
retailers to claim their products are 
“Made in U.S.A.” As of now, Shinola 
maintains it’s not being misleading 
because it’s open about where its 
parts are from. That’s certainly up 
for debate.

Also, Shinola was founded by 

Bedrock Manufacturing, an invest-
ment firm based in Texas owned by 
Tom Kartsotis, a co-founder of Fos-
sil — another watchmaking com-
pany! And the name Shinola comes 
from a half-century defunct shoe 
polish company — from New York.

As for Third Man, while no one 

should criticize Jack White for this, 
the company is based in Nashville. 
Furthermore, White hasn’t always 
had a strong relationship with 
Detroit, saying he left the city early 
in his career because it was chal-
lenging to live and create there. 
However, it’s worth noting that he 
did pay off the Masonic Temple’s 
$142,000 in back taxes in 2013 to 
keep the building from foreclosing.

From all of this, it’s easy to see 

how what these companies are 
doing can be perceived as merely 
opportunistic, 
taking 
advantage 

of Detroit’s gritty reputation and 

history of manufacturing to profit. 
Especially in the case of Shinola, 
where none of its founders are even 
from Detroit, it’s using this image 
of the city to sell madly expensive 
luxury items, products the average 
person cannot possibly afford or 
justify paying for.

For me, that’s uncomfortable and 

feels a bit like a farce. At the same 
time, though, I’m asking myself, 
“So what?”

No matter where these people 

come from or where the company 
is based, there is an immense value 
in bringing the value of manufac-
turing and hand-crafted goods to 
the forefront. For the people who 
will shop at these places (and again, 
there’s an entire conversation on the 
astounding and concerning lack of 
racial diversity at the stores), they’re 
going to be exposed to the creation 
of physical goods. They’ll see the 
records being pressed and the bevy 
of parts being carefully assembled 
into a wearable timepiece.

In a time when everything seems 

to be moving up to the cloud and it 
is way too easy to order whatever I 
want from Amazon, Shinola is saying 
timekeeping is an art not to be taken 
for granted. Third Man is musing 
that music shouldn’t just travel on 
circuit boards and servers. And both 
of those reasons make critiquing 
these companies extremely difficult.

I’m not quite sure how to balance 

this point with the questionable 
authenticity of these companies. 
Maybe it’s just a matter of trying to 
be a more informed consumer.

That said, there’s no doubt that 

as Detroit continues to progress 
economically, this balancing act 
won’t be going away. The people and 
leadership of the city need to ask 
themselves soon whether outsiders 
coming in should be given the abso-
lute right to monetize its culture. 
The answer will define what kind of 
city Detroit is going to be.

The clock is ticking.

Masterful ‘Eight’

FILM REVIEW

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

Somewhere, Quentin Taran-

tino is sipping a glass of wine, 
refreshing 
Rotten 
Tomatoes 

and laughing as 
he watches the 
critics squirm.

You 
can’t 

apply 
a 
one-

sentence thesis 
to a Tarantino 
film. You just 
can’t. But with 
the consistency 
of the chang-
ing of the sea-
sons, 
people 

are 
going 
to 

try. Critics have said that “The 
Hateful Eight” is about race in 
America or the cyclical nature of 
war. It’s not. It’s also not a “bad” 
or “evil” film. I’ve even seen a 
popular, intelligent critic pon-
tificate on Tarantino’s “moral 
compass.” To me, that’s awful, 
and making a broad statement 
on what a Tarantino film is 
about is maybe even worse. Say-
ing that people are missing the 
point is terribly elitist, I know, 
but I can’t think of a better way 
of putting it. 

“The Hateful Eight,” Taran-

tino’s funniest film, is the worst 

date movie of all time. Where 
“Django Unchained” was crowd 
pleasing even in its brutality, this 
is truly, gratuitously dark stuff. 
It’s marketed to the Applebee’s-
chowing, “Pulp Fiction”-loving 
crowd, but this one’s really for 
the weird kids: the trash cinema 
lovers, the art room goths, the 
Russ Meyer fans, the bitter, god-
less millennials.

Comprised entirely of won-

derful shots and even more 
wonderful performances, “The 
Hateful Eight” paints with the 
ultra-confident brush of a writ-
er/director who has known that 
he can do whatever the fuck he 
wants for his last five movies. 
When two bullets leave a giant 
smoldering crater where a man’s 
face would be, you know Taran-
tino’s crew did it precisely the 
way they meant to. Come on, 
you’ve known that since “Kill 
Bill.”

Okay, okay — I’ll try to get to 

some kind of a point. “The Hate-
ful Eight” is not like any western 
I’ve seen (besides its aesthetic, 
of course). It’s more like what 
I imagine the real life implica-
tions of the board game “Clue” 
would be like. We have expres-
sive, engaging characters with 
murder on the brain, and the 
fun is figuring out whodunit and 

why. The filmmakers employ 
Hitchcockian 
suspense 
with 

frightening ability: we’re shown 
the puzzle pieces and we shriek 
with pleasure as it all gets pieced 
together in front of us, one move 
at a time.

Wait, there’s a “Clue” movie 

already? Shit.

But even though the pieces 

are all together, the cardboard 
doesn’t form a sensible picture, 
or at least one that you would 
traditionally expect. Maybe the 
final moments of “The Hateful 
Eight” are like a puzzle picturing 
a huge, veiny penis. That might 
piss some people off, especially 
since the box the puzzle came in 
had a photo of a nice little John 
Ford vista on the front. Going 
again 
by 
Rotten 
Tomatoes, 

approximately 24 percent of you 
are going to be pissed off. Try 
not to be pissed off by the best 
film of 2015. Enjoy the masterful 
gratuity. It’s all a bit too much, 
and if you’re anything like me, 
you’re going to love every second 
of it.

Much like life itself, “The 

Hateful Eight” is a big beauti-
ful question without an answer, 
and it ends abruptly. I get that 
that’s frustrating, but, much 
like life itself, I wouldn’t want 
any of us to miss out on it.

Comedy queens 
shine in ‘Sisters’ 
 

FILM REVIEW

Fey and Poehler 
cut loose in new 

comedy

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

“Superbad” is all grown 

up in “Sisters,” a party movie 
starring 
comedy’s 
female 

dynamic 
duo: 
Tina 

Fey 
(“Date 

Night”) 
and 

Amy 
Poehler 

(“Inside 
Out”). Fey and 
Poehler 
play, 

as 
the 
title 

would suggest, 
sisters who return to their 
childhood home one last time 
before their parents sell it. Of 
course, they decide to throw a 
party to celebrate the symbolic 
end of their childhood. And, 
as is party movie standard, 
it all ends in mass, drunken 
destruction including phallic 
wall art and a sinkhole that 
eats half of the backyard.

In a role reversal of “Baby 

Mama,” Poehler plays Maura, 
an uptight nurse with chipper, 
neurotic 
tendencies. 
Fey 

unconvincingly plays her foil 
as a drunk slacker who can’t 
seem to “get it together.” But, 
the movie isn’t really about 
Maura and Kate, it’s about 
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. 
Both characters, as well as 
the 
supporting 
cast, 
seem 

quite aware of the actors who 
play them. The movie is funny 
because Tina Fey and Amy 
Poehler are funny, not because 
Maura and Kate are funny.

The party movie has emerged 

as a common, if not overused, 
formulaic subgenre of comedy. 
Most of the humor comes 
from the misadventures of 

the movies’ drunkest, highest, 
and stupidest characters and 
the fact that none of them 
would be friends if they were 
sober. “Sisters” follows the 
party movie formula perfectly, 
but while it loses points on 
originality, it gains them on 
scientifically proven funniness.

The party is exactly as one 

might hope a “Saturday Night 
Live” reunion party would be. 
With a cast of full of late night 

alums, the jokes are absurd and 
plentiful. At times the movie 
feels like a 2-hour sketch, in 
which “SNL” ’s usual formula 
of non-stop one-liners begins 
to feel tiresome. “Sisters” never 
stops to take a breath, cutting 
frantically between Poehler’s 
sexual misadventures, Fey’s 
booze-fueled 
rage 
and 
a 

coked-out Bobby Moynihan 
(“Saturday Night Live”) doing 
“Scarface” 
impersonations. 

That’s why the sudden jump 
to poignancy in the last 15 
minutes feels so unnecessary 
— it’s too abrupt a stop in the 
flow of humor to feel like 
a proper ending. We should 
have just left Kate and Maura 
hugging next to a sinkhole and 
gone home.

The problem with “Sisters” 

isn’t that it’s not funny; it’s 
that it’s not clever. Headed by 
two of the smartest, quickest 
women in Hollywood with a 
script written by a longtime 
SNL writer, it is easy to be 
disappointed 
by 
the 
film’s 

reliance on pure raunchiness 
alone to carry its humor. 
Every spare second is filled 
with 
swearing 
and 
sex 

jokes — many of which seem 
surprisingly retrograde for a 
movie about women written by 
a woman. And nothing screams 
retrograde like a girl fight, so 
it’s always disappointing when 

a movie that passes the Bechdel 
test decides to pit its leading 
ladies against each other in a 
mud brawl.

What saves “Sisters” is its 

longer, more developed gags. 
A scene in which Maura’s love 
interest, played by “The Mindy 
Project” ’s Ike Barinholtz, gets 
a music box stuck up his butt 
and an ongoing joke where 
Tina Fey tries to woo a drug 
dealer played by John Cena 
(“Trainwreck”) 
ground 
the 

movie in some well-developed 
humor. It’s a nice break from 
constant 
one-liners 
and 

provides the opportunity for 
Fey and Poehler to flex their 
comedic muscles without being 
out-shouted by the supporting 
cast. 

“Sisters” is a 2-hour assault 

of irreverence. It’s not the best 
work from comedy’s girl power 
dynamic duo, but it’s funny and 
finds moments of cleverness. 
It’s the perfect movie to see if 
you need a mindless break from 
talking to relatives this holiday.

Eye-opening ‘Big 
Short’ distressing

FILM REVIEW

Odd and self-aware 
film follows 2008 

financial crisis

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

A group of angry Wall Street 

traders predicting and profiting 
off the 2008 economic recession 
doesn’t scream 
entertainment, 
but 
writer 

and 
director 

Adam 
McK-

ay’s (“Anchor-
man”) “The Big 
Short” 
makes 

for an honest 
and captivating 
tale of greed, 
lies and devas-
tation.

The film stars some of Hol-

lywood’s most handsome men 
with some of the world’s ugli-
est haircuts. As bankers and 
traders, they predict the crash 
through careful analysis of the 
housing market as early as 2005 
and decide they can profit by 
betting banks that the loans 
they have given out will default.

Initially, ”The Big Short” 

reads as a documentary narrat-
ed by Ryan Gosling’s (“Drive”) 
character Jared Vennett (which 
begs the question: why doesn’t 
Ryan Gosling narrate docu-
mentaries?). While the camera 
cuts rapidly through stills from 
music videos, ‘for sale’ signs 
and celebrity mug shots, Jared 
introduces 
the 
audience 
to 

the world of 2005 Wall Street. 
It’s patchy and quick, moving 
quickly between images in a 
way that resembles memory. In 

fact, the whole movie is filmed 
like a memory. Long scenes 
are broken up by quick slides 
of images, much like how one 
might remember a year in their 
life.

Although the subject seems 

out of place compared to McK-
ay’s 
previous 
work 
(mostly 

absurdist Will Ferrell com-
edies), “The Big Short” is pep-
pered with humor even in its 
slower moments. Steve Carell 
(“Foxcatcher”), the film’s come-
dy veteran, carries much of that 
comedic weight, employing the 
painful but funny style of com-
edy reminiscent of his character 
on “The Office,” Michael Scott. 
However, Gosling holds his 
own with a sharp wit and mean 
deadpan. The humor is dark, 
but it serves as a cutter for the 
film’s heavy technical jargon 
and darker moral undertones.

“The Big Short” sets itself up 

to be a movie with a powerhouse 
ensemble cast, but the characters 
come across more as independent 
entities rather than one cohesive 
unit. Christian Bale (“The Dark 
Knight Rises”) plays an oddball 
neurosurgeon-turned-trader, 
Michael Burry, who is the first 
to discover the housing market’s 
dirty little secret. He delivers 
one of the film’s strongest perfor-
mances, but unfortunately does 
not share the screen with any of 

the other leads. While they all 
deliver strong performances on 
their own, the actors fail to unify 
as an ensemble in the way that’s 
expected in a story without one 
single lead.

The film is odd and self-aware 

in a way that comes off as endear-
ing rather than nervous. McKay 
knows that one of his greatest 
obstacles is the public’s ignorance 
or misunderstanding of the com-
plex systems that led to both the 
creation and the burst of the loan 
bubble behind the 2008 financial 
crisis. Because a film can’t have 
footnotes and working definitions 
into conversation is unnatural, 
McKay uses short star-studded 
asides to explain the terminology 
needed to understand and fully 
appreciate the film. Synthetic 
CDOs and mortgage security 
were never sexy until explained 
by Anthony Bourdain and Selena 
Gomez. In this regard, the film 
seems aware of its role as an edu-
cational tool. It’s important for 
the American people to under-
stand the biggest economic crisis 
of (most) of their lifetimes and 
McKay seems to argue that learn-
ing about it can be fun too.

“The Big Short” isn’t “The Wolf 

of Wall Street” and it wants to 
make that point clear right away. 
Choosing Margot Robbie (“The 
Wolf of Wall Street”) as the bomb-
shell cameo who explains mort-
gage bonds in a bubble bath can 
only be seen as a nod to the 2013 
Wall Street blockbuster. How-
ever, “The Big Short” goes beyond 
the glam and scam of its prede-
cessor to get at the heart of this 
kind of banking — working class 
Americans. In on of the film’s 
final scenes, Carell’s character, 
Mark Baum, debates not selling 
his credit default swaps because 
he is disgusted with himself and 
the banks whose greed pushed 
the loan bubble to burst.

The ending of “The Big Short” 

is as satisfying as it is unsettling. 
After spending two hours fol-
lowing the ups and downs of the 
characters, it’s rewarding to see 
Gosling kiss a $47 million check. 
But then the camera cuts to a 
family living out of their car in a 
gas station parking lot after los-
ing their home in the recession. 
And therein lies the great tragedy 
that “The Big Short” manages to 
uncover — for some people the 
housing market crash of 2008 
was the best thing that ever 
happened to them, but for the 
over 6 million Americans who 
lost their homes that year, it was 
the worst thing that ever hap-
pened to them.

“The Big Short” isn’t flashy or 

glamorous, but it is eye opening. 
It gives its audience an inside 
look into the corruption of Wall 
Street while still applauding the 
oddballs and eccentrics who 
are willing to take risks and go 
against the grain.

MOVE MOVIE

“Who cares if I’m pretty if I fail my finals?!”

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Film Editor

Film is full of clichés about 

female friendships. For every 
instance of reality in movies like 
“Mean Girls” 

and 
“A 

League of Their 
Own,” 
there’s 

a case of boy-
friend stealing 
or mud-fighting 
that 
crumbles 

the 
feminine 

identity 
into 

ugly 
stereo-

types. But the female-driven 
“Breathe,” directed by “Inglori-
ous Bastards” star Mélanie Lau-
rent, never delves into cliché, 
instead dissecting the intimacy 
and complexity of the relation-
ships of adolescent girls.

“Breathe” opens on the timid 

Charlie (Joséphine Japy, “My 
Way”), a French teenage girl 
with parents who are too busy 
with a vicious cycle of breaking 
up and getting back together to 
pay any attention to her. Char-
lie’s suburban life is a drab series 
of school and childhood friends 
until a cleaving occurs. This 
cleaving, is her instantaneous 
connection with the beautiful 
and enigmatic new girl, Sarah 
(Lou de Laâge, “The Wait”).

Sarah and Charlie swiftly 

become inseparable. They are an 
unlikely pairing, as Sarah’s sta-
tus as the epitome of a “cool girl” 
is acutely juxtaposed with Char-
lie’s awkward reticence. Sarah 
exudes confidence while she 
brags of living in exotic places 
with her saintly but absent relief 
worker mother. She immedi-
ately charms Charlie and breaks 
the rhythm of her monotonous 
life. But behind the cigarette 
smoke and mirrors of glamorous 
French clubs, Sarah has a streak 
of cruelty. It’s subtle at first — we 
see it in Laurent’s cinematogra-
phy, the way the camera lingers 
on Sarah as she makes decisions 
about who to socially persecute. 
She ruthlessly ices out Charlie’s 
childhood best friend and per-
fects the powerful art of making 
Charlie feel like her best friend 
and the most important person 
in her life.

This dubious love is abruptly 

altered during a vacation to the 
countryside when Charlie makes 
the fatal mistake of introduc-
ing Sarah as a classmate, rather 
than a friend. After this rather 
small incident, their relationship 
transforms into the vacillating 
hot and cold state of frenemies. 
Sarah becomes gruesome in her 
malice because of the affection 
she so tenderly displays after-
wards. We follow Charlie on the 
roller coaster of Sarah’s love, 
which takes both of them to plac-

es neither could have imagined.

Though more famous for her 

onscreen work, Laurent is no 
stranger to screenwriting and 
directing. “Breathe” is her sec-
ond feature film. Her first, “The 
Adopted,” came out in 2011. 
Though similar in both style and 
subject matter, “Breathe” shows 
great promise for the actress-
turned-filmmaker. Laurent’s dis-
tinctly French style of delicacy 
and focus on the small and regu-
lar aspects of life are honed in 
“Breathe” and create the sense of 
urgency surrounding the film’s 
toxic relationship.

But 
Laurent’s 
successful 

choices for “Breathe” aren’t lim-
ited to camerawork — they also 
extend to her choice of actors. 
Both performances — de Laâge’s 
seductive nature as the venom-
ous Sarah and Japy’s transfor-
mation of Charlie from a naïve 
girl to a mysterious woman — are 
breathtaking.

“Breathe” is a film that is 

unafraid to redefine and break 
the schemas we have of teenage 
girls and their relationships. It 
doesn’t fit nicely into a category 
— there is humor and love, but 
there is also unbearable dark-
ness that will get under your skin 
and make you think about it for 
days. In its beauty and grotesque 
harshness, “Breathe” captures 
the true essence of teenage 
girls and relationships.

Promising ‘Breathe’

BØRNS at Shelter: 
A love letter to fans

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY 

and CARLY SNIDER

Daily Music Editor and Daily Arts 

Writer

The Shelter is small, dense 

and dark. Exposed ceiling beams 
and black support beams give 
the space an air of raw authen-
ticity — just the way a venue for 
the arts ought to unfold to its 
audience. BØRNS graced the 
basement of St. Andrew’s Hall 
in Detroit on Wednesday night, 
enchanting the small crowd 
with his long brown locks and 
delicate vocals. Not dissimilar 
to the main attraction, Phases 
prepped the crowd by filling 
the room with a flirty, jump-
ing sound as the second of two 
openers.

The young crowd seemed 

unable to contain its excitement, 
though, bursting out in waves of 
cheers every few minutes while 
waiting for the Michigan native 
to take the stage. Stepping onto 
the small stage with his band, 
BØRNS opened with “Dug My 
Heart” and was almost entirely 
eclipsed by the shouts, applause 
and singing voices of the crowd. 
Whether it was an elongated 
tone of the keyboard, a smatter-
ing of conversation from the per-
formers or a few quick strums of 
a guitar, there was never a silent 
moment.

This lack of intimacy is 

uncommon for a venue as small 
as The Shelter, but it was made 
up for with the performance and 
few utterances by BØRNS him-
self. His body language — rais-
ing a quivering arm above his 
head or bending to croon over 
the masses in front of him — told 
the crowd that he is completely 

consumed in his art. Describ-
ing the crowd as “beatific bod-
ies and glorious spirits,” BØRNS 
brought out the more sensual 
and warm underlying tones of 
his music. He described his audi-
ence as an ocean and dedicated 
“Overnight Sensation” to the 
crowd by describing the tune as 
“a love letter from me to you.”

Wrapping up the evening 

with an encore performance 
of “Bennie and the Jets” and 
“Seeing Stars,” BØRNS flexed 
his musical muscle. By ending 
with one of his singles from his 
first EP, he was able to show how 
far he has come as an artist in 
such a short period of time. And, 
judging by the passion of his fans 
and the musical mastery shown 
on Wednesday, there is nothing 
stopping him from continuing to 
do so.

I 
googled 
the 
word 

“pretentious” as I attempted 
to gather my reeling thoughts 
surrounding BØRNS’s set at The 
Shelter on Wednesday. I googled 
the word “pretentious” because 
I realized the impossibility of 
talking about BØRNS without 
sounding pretentious.

pre·ten·tious: 
adjective 
1. 

attempting to impress by affect-
ing greater importance, talent, 
culture, etc., than is actually 
possessed.

I then googled “tentious” 

because I was curious if there 
was 
a 
semantically-relat-

ed word for “impressing by 
affecting importance, talent, 
culture etc., that is actually 
possessed.” That would be how 
to best describe the experi-

ence of BØRNS. His set, almost 
entirely pulled from his debut 
album, Dopamine, elevated the 
basement of St. Andrew’s Hall, 
effectively neutralizing the hot 
air into soft coolness mimicked 
by the crowd’s sways, subtle 
arm waves and smiling faces. 
The electro-pop sound crafted 
by the Michigan native feels 
like a concept album. Each track 
touches on a different subtle-
ty in the emotional love story 
crafted between its narrator 
and subject.

In some cases it was a love 

letter from BØRNS to the crowd 
with 
“Overnight 
Sensation.” 

Set opener “Dug My Heart” is 
easily overlooked between the 
musical-liquid 
hybrid 
magic 

of “10,000 Emerald Pools” and 
the soaring vocals of “Electric 
Love” on the LP, but live the 
track’s drum beats vibrated 
throughout the room, priming 
the crowd for what was to fol-
low. The repetition in “Dopa-
mine” built the crowd a tiny bit 
closer to euphoria, and the funk 
of “The Fool” kept the spirit 
high.

Each song further built up the 

bubble created by BØRNS’s sin-
gular, listener-engulfing sound 
so much that when the time 
came for his two-song encore 
of a “Bennie and the Jets” cover 
and “Seeing Stars,” the crowd, 
band and BØRNS himself felt 
fluid in an evening of ecstatic 
percussion and smooth delivery.

It’s OK that I sound preten-

tious writing about BØRNS. I 
use smooth language and vibe-y 
diction to describe the concert, 
but in the end it’s BØRNS with 
the “importance, talent and cul-
ture” to back me up.

Jim Harbaugh’s ball team

J

im Harbaugh sat in the 
bowels of the Citrus Bowl 
after his 

team’s 41-7 
undressing 
of Florida 
last Friday, 
gushing about 
the NFL 
prospects of 
his seniors.

Starting 

center 
Graham 
Glasgow, 
Harbaugh said, could be a first-
round pick. Jake Rudock, as 
evidenced by his performance 
in the second half of Michigan’s 
season, has NFL talent in 
Harbaugh’s eyes as well. Safety 
Jarrod Wilson does, too.

Harbaugh’s presence, in all 

likelihood, has increased their 
chances greatly. He molded 
numerous low-level recruits into 
NFL draft picks at Stanford, 
and he worked with the highest 
level of NFL talent with the San 
Francisco 49ers, whom he led 
to the Super Bowl a mere three 
years ago.

But this experience, helping 

this group and coming back to 
his alma mater, was Harbaugh’s 
favorite in football. He thinks 
many of his players felt the same 
way about this past season.

“Just being in our locker 

room, I can tell you this: I don’t 
know ... what word to describe 
it other than if you could have 
been there with us in the locker 
room, you would have noticed 
that guys like being on our 
ball team,” Harbaugh said. 
“We’re on a ball team. It’s the 
Michigan Wolverine football 
team. And we like being on that 
ball team. And I know there are 
guys in that locker room that 
really like … (they’re) happy 
they’re on a ball team and glad 
it’s this one and like what we 
got going on.”

It seems clear that most of 

the starters and regular players 
love suiting up for Harbaugh. 
James Ross said most of the 
Wolverines would run through 
a brick wall for their coach after 
Michigan defeated Penn State in 
November. Rudock and De’Veon 
Smith, sitting next to Harbaugh 
during his press conference 
after the Citrus Bowl, agreed 
with him that this was their best 
season in football.

But there are 120 players on 

the Michigan football team’s 
roster. Did Harbaugh’s arrival, 
one year later, help the players 
who hardly played, aren’t on 
scholarship and could never 
dream of reaching the NFL?

Take senior tight end Michael 

Jocz. He has a 3.97 GPA in 
mechanical engineering and 
won the team’s award for best 
student-athlete this season. 
He’s smarter than most non-
football playing nerds on 
campus. He probably doesn’t 
need Harbaugh’s tutelage 
or Michigan football to be 
successful in life (though 
becoming an engineer would be 
another interesting offseason 
venture for Harbaugh).

Jocz is way down the depth 

chart at tight end and has hardly 
seen consistent playing time 
throughout his Michigan career. 
He puts in just as much effort as 
the starters 
by working 
his tail off in 
practice, but 
doesn’t get 
the reward 
of playing 
frequently on 
Saturdays.

He calls 

himself 
a fifth-
generation 
Michigan fan and has rooted 
for the Wolverines for his entire 
life. Jocz has seen tough times 

and a losing season as a player. 
He kept going — even when 
it might’ve been easier to just 
focus on school — to continue 
his dream of playing Michigan 
football.

This year, he feels like the 

program he loves has its dignity 
back. And Jocz feels like he 
and his fellow walk-ons have a 
role in that, too. Harbaugh has 
helped the guys who don’t play 
very much feel like they have a 
role in the group’s success, just 
like the starters do.

“As a team, we do a good job 

of knowing that by helping each 
other out, we help everybody 
out,” Jocz said Wednesday. 
“Not just, ‘If I get better, I get 
my turn.’ It’s all about the team 
effort and being together as one, 
and that’s how we’re going to 
win football games.”

Take Brad Anlauf. He’s a 

senior wide receiver on this 
year’s football team. If you know 
his name, it’s probably from his 
stint as a walk-on on the men’s 
basketball team in the 2013-14 
season, when the Wolverines 
won the Big Ten championship 
and made it all the way to the 
Elite Eight. But Anlauf has been 
on the football team for his 
other three years at Michigan, 
his game days spent largely on 
the sideline.

In a way, Harbaugh’s arrival 

brought 
his football 
career 
new life. 
Harbaugh, 
famously, 
is all about 
competition. 
In the 
spring, he 
insisted the 
quarterback 
position 

would sort itself out, that the 
best player would step up and 
make the plays. That creed of 

open competition extended to 
everyone on the team, not just 
the guys on scholarship.

Sure, no walk-ons carved out 

regular starting roles on the 
team this season. Former walk-
ons Joe Kerridge, Kenny Allen 
and Ryan and Graham Glasgow 
are all on scholarship now, and 
they contributed regularly. But 
under Harbaugh, the rest of the 
walk-ons felt like they had a 
chance to earn playing time, too.

“There’s no sense of 

entitlement around Coach 
Harbaugh,” Anlauf said. “If his 
own son, eventually, if he comes 
and plays here, he’s not going to 
give him an edge over another 
kid playing at that position.”

Take Shaun Austin. You’ve 

probably never heard his name. 
He’s a senior walk-on safety, 
and he didn’t get into a game 
this year. He lives with other 
football players, including Chris 
Wormley and Tom Strobel, guys 
who see the field regularly.

Under Harbaugh, he feels like 

he’s just as important as those 
guys, playing time be damned.

“It’s cool to not take a 

backseat to someone else, at 
least get a chance,” Austin said.

Austin gets hit every day 

in practice, and he went 
into every game knowing he 
probably wouldn’t be needed. 
He’s a political science major 
and hopes to go to law school 

someday. Playing for Harbaugh 
won’t help him get to the NFL 
or achieve some wild football 
fantasy. He admits he’s a little 
crazy for putting himself 
through the grind. So why does 
he do it?

“It’s easy to play for the 

guys, I think that’s the biggest 
thing,” Austin said. “Even if 
you’re not doing it for yourself, 
there’s other guys you’ve 
grown close with over the 
years that make it easy to come 
out and play for them.”

Sounds like a ball team, indeed.

‘M’ dismantles Florida, 41-7

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

ORLANDO, 
Fla. 
— 
The 

Michigan football team came out 
and scored on its first drive of 
the second half. And that’s when 
redshirt junior defensive lineman 
Chris Wormley said it happened.

The Wolverines led Florida, 

24-7, at that point. On the first 
play of the Gators’ next series, 
Wormley sacked quarterback 
Treon Harris. That led to a 
three-and-out, giving the ball 
back to Michigan’s offense.

“And you could tell in their 

eyes — you could see they 
didn’t want to play anymore,” 
Wormley 
said. 
“They 
were 

down probably three scores by 
then, and it’s just a good feeling, 
especially for a defense — to 
stomp on their throats.”

And still 21 more minutes of 

dominance remained.

When 
that 
time 
elapsed, 

Michigan celebrated on the field 
with the bowl trophy. Its players 
had talked since the end of the 
regular season about reaching 
the milestone of 10 wins. They 
demolished Florida, 41-7, and 
their days of being demolished 
seemed to be in the distant past.

The 
Wolverines 
(6-2 
Big 

Ten, 10-3 overall) had routed 
opponents in a similar fashion 
before, but this came against a 
marquee SEC opponent in the 
Citrus Bowl. Michigan last beat 
an SEC team eight years ago to 
the day, when the Wolverines 
beat Florida in the same bowl in 
Lloyd Carr’s last game as coach.

“I’d say this was the best game 

we played all year,” Harbaugh 
said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen 
our offense play better. And our 
defense was magnificent.”

Added Florida coach Jim 

McElwain: “It was a case of 
getting your rump kicked in. 
That’s what it was.”

Michigan came into the bowl 

game with the same intensity 
as any other game, and the 
same refusal to let up. When 
the offense regained possession 
four plays after Wormley’s sack, 
redshirt junior wide receiver 
Jehu Chesson outran Florida 
cornerback Vernon Hargreaves 

III for the second time in the 
game. He hauled in a 45-yard 
pass 
from 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock, and 
senior fullback Sione Houma 
punched it in three plays later.

The Gators (7-1 SEC, 10-4 

overall) kept the ball for just 62 
seconds on their next series, and 
Michigan went back to work on 
a 12-play, 84-yard touchdown 
drive to extend the lead to 38-7 
early 
in 
the 

fourth quarter.

The 

outcome 
had 

long 
been 

decided, 
and 
though 

Wormley 
smelled blood 
in the water 
almost 
a 

quarter earlier, more than 12 
minutes remained.

“That’s the whole objective 

of our defense,” Wormley said. 
“You don’t let them score. You 
take their will away, and that’s 
what we did today. It’s a great 
feeling.”

Florida’s 
brief 
window 
of 

opportunity came in the first 
quarter. On the Gators’ first 
possession, they moved the ball 

55 yards in 12 plays over 4:37 but 
stalled at the Wolverines’ 20-yard 
line. On 4th-and-7, they lined up 
in field-goal formation, but the 
holder flipped the ball toward the 
line of scrimmage and Michigan 
junior 
cornerback 
Channing 

Stribling intercepted it.

Another 
turnover 
in 
the 

second quarter continued to 
separate the teams. The Gators 
reached the Michigan red zone 

again, 
but 

Harris 
threw 

an interception 
off 
his 
back 

foot to senior 
safety 
Jarrod 

Wilson. 
That 

was as close as 
Florida got for 
the rest of the 
game.

Meanwhile, the Wolverines’ 

offense rolled over the Gators’ 
highly ranked defense. Michigan 
scored points on six of its first 
seven possessions and moved the 
ball on the ground for 225 yards 
and through the air for 278.

Junior running back De’Veon 

Smith carried 25 times for 109 
yards, the first Michigan player 
to reach the mark since he did so 
Sept. 26 against Brigham Young. 

Chesson caught five passes for 118 
yards and a touchdown, including 
two big plays in his matchup 
with Hargreaves. And Rudock, 
the game MVP, was 20-for-31 for 
278 yards and three touchdowns. 
With that performance, he moved 
into second place on Michigan’s 
all-time 
single-season 
passing 

yards list.

“Jake Rudock was fabulous, on 

the money today,” Harbaugh said. 
“I mean, darn near flawless.”

Rudock and most of the 

starters stayed in until the end. 
In his final collegiate game, 
Michigan’s quarterback didn’t 
take a knee until the final play. 
Long 
after 
the 
Wolverines 

stomped on Florida’s throats, 
their work was done. There was 
no time left.

Harbaugh called 2015 his 

favorite year in football, and 
Rudock and Smith agreed after 
the game, but only then did 
their celebration start. Some 
players will move onto the NFL 
or elsewhere, and some will turn 
their focus toward 2016.

“Guys like De’Veon and me,” 

Harbaugh said after the game, 
turning to his running back, 
“onward, 2016. This was the 
beginning of that year.”

FOOTBALL
‘The Kingdom’ 
powers victory

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor

ORLANDO, 
Fla. 
— 
Drake 

Johnson’s 
favorite 
moment 

of the Citrus Bowl wasn’t his 
rushing touchdown in the first 
quarter, nor was it his receiving 
touchdown in the fourth or the 
trophy presentation after the 
game.

No, the moment that Johnson 

identified as the day’s best was a 
two-yard touchdown by senior 
fullback Sione Houma with 3:48 
left in the third quarter. The 
Wolverines 
already 
led 
24-7 

at that point, so it wasn’t like 
Houma’s score changed the game.

What it did do, though, is fulfill 

a season-long goal Johnson has 
had with his roommates, Houma 
and redshirt junior receiver Jehu 
Chesson.

All 
year 
long, 
the 
three 

roommates have wanted to each 
score a touchdown in the same 
game. So late in the third quarter, 
when Houma plunged in from 
two yards out, Johnson was 
elated.

“We 
call 
ourselves 
‘The 

Kingdom,’ we live in an apartment 
called ‘The Kingdom,’ ” Johnson 
said. “We stepped on the field 
today, and Jehu walked up to me 
and he goes, ‘Today.’ And I was 
like, ‘What?’ He was like, ‘We’re 
going to get all three today.’ ”

On the stage at the trophy 

presentation, Chesson wondered 
aloud into the microphone if the 
trio of roommates scoring might 
be some kind of record.

And while STATS LLC doesn’t 

keep those kind of records, the 
moment was special for the trio, 
which had fallen just short so 
many times this season. Houma 
and Chesson both scored against 
UNLV, but no Johnson. Chesson 
and Johnson both scored against 
Maryland, 
Northwestern 
and 

Rutgers, but no Houma.

But in Friday’s 41-7 win over 

Florida, there were plenty of 
scores to go around, and all three 
collected.

Johnson got the scoring rolling 

with a four-yard touchdown in 
the first quarter, and Chesson 
burned Vernon Hargreaves III, 
regarded as one of the nation’s 
best cornerbacks, with a double 
move for a 31-yard touchdown in 
the second.

Late in the third, fifth-year 

senior quarterback Jake Rudock 
hit Chesson for a 45-yard bomb 
to the Gators’ 10-yard line, and 
Houma punched it in three plays 
later.

All three had strong seasons, 

with Johnson recovering from 
his second torn ACL and Houma 
and Chesson breaking out largely 
for the first time. Chesson had 12 
total touchdowns on the season, 
Johnson finished with six and 
Houma with five.

So was it something in the 

water at “The Kingdom?”

“Maybe,” Johnson said. “We 

have a nice apartment, we have a 
nice place. We sleep comfortably. 
Maybe that’s what did it.”

As for Chesson’s prediction 

come true, Johnson said that’s 
nothing out of the ordinary. He is 
the responsible one of the group, 
and Johnson referred to him as 
“The Great Affirmer,” someone 
who could expedite the ongoings 
of the apartment.

“Pardon my French, but Jehu’s 

got his shit together,” Johnson 
said. “Like if there’s someone on 
our team who really has their 
stuff together, Jehu has his shit 
together.

“Him being in our house has 

been such a blessing because 
there’s times where I’m just like 
… You know, I’m a goofy person. 
And like, I’m the one person in 
the house who’s just so carefree 
like, that’s like, ‘it’ll be ok.’ And 
Jehu’s the person in the house 
who’s like, ‘Hey. We need to get 
this done.’ ”

On Friday, in their last chance 

to 
all 
score 
before 
Houma 

graduates and moves on, Chesson 
affirmed it.

The Kingdom came, and its 

will was done.

“I’d say this was 
the best game we 
played all year.”

One key stat line differentiated 

the 
Indiana 
and 
Michigan 

women’s basketball teams in the 
Hoosiers’ 77-69 overtime win on 
Sunday.

The 

Hoosiers 
(1-1 Big Ten, 
9-5 overall) 
went 32-for-42 from the free throw 
line, and the Wolverines (0-2 
Big Ten, 8-5 overall) went 8-for-
18. After four quarters of back-
and-forth basketball, there was 
overtime in Bloomington, and 12 of 
Indiana’s 16 overtime points came 
from the line.

Led by a near double-double 

from forward Amanda Cahill (19 
points, nine rebounds, four blocks, 
two assists), the Hoosiers rallied 
back from what was a nine-point 
deficit in the fourth quarter.

“We were up six or eight, and 

then we were not able to score 

again for a long period of time,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
on the team radio broadcast. “They 
scored, we gave up some and-1s, we 
gave up some offensive rebounds 
and they got the momentum.”

Three of Cahill’s blocks came in 

overtime. She 
dominated 
in the paint 
against 
Michigan’s 
star freshman 
center Hallie 
Thome.

Indiana 

guard 
Tyra 

Buss 
scored 

the Hoosiers’ final four points in 
regulation with two free throws 
and a layup. Buss pushed Indiana 
ahead for three-point lead, but 
with 28 seconds to go, Michigan 
sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty drilled an off-balance 
3-pointer that tied the game.

Flaherty — Michigan’s leading 

scorer — and Buss were both quiet 

in the first half, combining for 
fewer than 10 points, but the two 
guards ended the game with 20 
and 18 points, respectively.

Shooting 76.3 percent from 

the line was Indiana’s best 
weapon, and the team took 

advantage of the 
bonus late in the 
game. Indiana’s 
win marks its 
first 
against 

Michigan since 
2010, a stretch 
that has seen 
the 
Hoosiers 

lose 10 games.

The 

Wolverines’ loss is the third of a 
three-game losing streak, and they 
are still looking for their first win in 
the Big Ten after falling to Purdue 
on Thursday, continuing what has 
been a rough holiday season.

For one quarter, Michigan 

played like the group that lost to 
Purdue. For the other three, it 
played like the team that began 

the 2015-16 season with seven 
straight wins.

But the entire time, it stayed 

close with Indiana. Though, if the 
Hoosiers watched Michigan lose 
its Big Ten opener to Purdue, they 
knew exactly how to slow down 
the Wolverines.

They didn’t let Michigan — one 

of the highest scoring offenses in 
the nation — get ahead early. They 
forced Thome to foul and made 
the Wolverines’ outside shooters 
to find other ways to score.

Michigan had just 12 points in 

the first quarter, and Thome had 
two fouls within a minute of play. 
The Wolverines shot below 50 
percent from beyond the arc but 
still hit seven 3-pointers, which 
kept them in the game.

“(Thome) sure didn’t recover 

too much (from the early fouls),” 
Barnes Arico said.

Indiana’s game plan worked, 

and the Hoosiers consistent free 
throw efforts proved them the 
better team Sunday.

Wolverines drop third straight in OT

‘M’ opens season 
with two victories

Wolverines top No. 
13 Arkansas, Iowa 

in Cancun over 
Winter Break

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

For the Daily

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

gymnastics team went into its 
first meet of the year hoping 
to find out what it was capable 
of. And as the seventh-ranked 
Wolverines found out, they are 
capable of achieving big things.

Led by junior Nicole Artz 

and freshman Olivia Karas, 
Michigan (2-0) defeated No. 
13 Arkansas, 196.975-195.150, 
and 
Iowa, 

196.975-
192.475.

Artz, 
a 

five-time All-
American, 
took 
first 

place in the 
floor exercise 
and 
uneven 

parallel 
bars, 
which 

propelled 
her to an all-around first-
place finish with 39.525 points. 
Following behind her in second 
place in the all-around was 
Karas, who stole the balance 
beam and vault events.

Together, the duo split the 

four events to help Michigan 
earn its victory.

The 
Wolverines 
started 

similarly strong last season, 
when they knocked off then-
No. 7 Georgia in a dual meet, 
196.600-195.600. 
And 
after 

seeing her team down a top-15 
opponent to open the season 
for a second straight year on 
Saturday, Michigan coach Bev 
Plocki came away impressed, 

even if the team wasn’t flawless 
in its regular-season debut.

“I don’t know that I would say 

we have a very big weakness,” 
Plocki said. “I think that in this 
particular meet, we could have 
performed a little bit better or 
didn’t perform quite as much up 
to our expectations on uneven 
bars, but it wasn’t bad by any 
stretch. 

“I think this is a pretty good 

team in all four events.”

The meet, which was held 

in a hotel ballroom in Cancun, 
wasn’t the only part of the 
team’s trip to Mexico. The trip 
also served as a team bonding 
event, as the Wolverines had a 
chance to enjoy some time away 
from the mat.

While away, Michigan went 

parasailing 
over 
the 

Caribbean 
Sea, sailed on 
a catamaran 
and even had 
the chance to 
pet a shark.

“We 
got 

to do some 
really 
fun 

and different 
things 
and 

just see people in their most 
relaxed, easygoing state outside 
of the gym, outside of practice 
and outside of competition,” 
Plocki said. “It was absolutely 
a great bonding trip. I think 
this team has gelled, and we 
got a great chemistry going 
forward.”

The Wolverines hope the 

victory and chemistry the 
trip provided will bring them 
confidence and momentum as 
they go into their next match 
against Georgia. They host the 
Bulldogs on Saturday, their last 
chance to compete before the 
start of conference play Jan. 16 
against Ohio State.

Redshirts earn 
opportunity with 
usual starters out

By MIKE PERSAK

For the Daily

It wasn’t the most important 

tournament of the year for the 
Michigan wrestling team — the 
Wolverines didn’t even send their 
starters to compete. But after the 
annual Southern Scuffle, they 
and their coaches grew excited 
about their future thanks to some 
of the young wrestlers who made 
the trip to Chattanooga, Tenn.

Two freshmen in particular 

stood out. Logan Massa, wrestling 
in the 165-pound division, and 
Austin Assad, wrestling in the 
125-pound 
division, 
medaled 

against perhaps their toughest 
competition of the year. Assad 
finished sixth in his division, 
while Massa came in second.

Though both Massa and Assad 

are 
redshirting 
this 
season, 

this 
particular 
tournament 

allowed redshirts to compete as 
unattached wrestlers, meaning 
they could identify with their 
school 
but 
could 
not 
earn 

points for their team’s standing. 
In 
addition, 
the 
unattached 

wrestlers had to pay for their 
own 
travels 
and 
could 
not 

be coached by their college’s 
coaches while at the tournament. 
This format allows wrestlers to 
keep their redshirt and maintain 
full eligibility, while still gaining 
valuable, in-match experience.

“This is really a development 

year 
for 
these 
guys,” 
said 

Michigan 
assistant 
coach 
Josh 

Churella. 
“A 

lot of times, 
they don’t get 
to 
wrestle 

this kind of 
competition 
throughout 
the year. So 
they decided to pay for it and 
come down on their own and 

compete. They took advantage 
of this opportunity, which was a 
really good one for them.”

The 
only 
thing 
standing 

between 
Massa 
and 
a 

championship 
was 
two-time 

defending 
national 
champion 

Alex Dieringer from Oklahoma 
State. Massa put up a good fight in 
a match that was closer than the 
final count appeared, as Dieringer 
scored late points in the third 
period to extend his victory to 8-2.

Massa’s 
loss 
to 
Dieringer 

marked the 10th-seeded 165 
pounder’s first loss of the season, 
and the freshman was not content 

with coming in 
second.

“There’s 
a 

lot of room for 
improvement,” 
Massa 
said. 

“(Dieringer) 
found 
where 

I have some 
weaknesses, 
and they got 

exposed. There’s positions that I 
need to work on.”

In the 125-pound bracket, 

Assad came in sixth place with a 
4-3 record on the weekend. His 
only losses were to the third seed 
(twice) and fourth seed and were 
his first of the season. His record 
is now 14-3.

An elbow injury from the 

summer kept Hall out of action 
during the fall semester.

Hall’s weekend was a roller 

coaster, as he started with a 
loss but recovered in a big way 
in his next match by defeating 
the second-seeded 141-pounder, 
Jimmy Gulibon from Penn State.

“He 
did 
rebound 
well 

to beat the No. 6 kid in the 
country,” Churella said. “But 
he didn’t have that consistency 
throughout the tournament, and 
that’s what prevented him from 
placing here.”

Michigan finished 28th out 

of 31 teams in the tournament, 
without Massa and Assad, but 
it was a positive experience for 
many individual Wolverines, as 
they look ahead to the rest of the 
season and beyond.

Youngsters impress at Southern Scuffle

a pretty good 

team in all 
four events.”

WOMEN’S SWIMMING AND DIVING
Wolverines spend 
new year training

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 9 Michigan women’s 

swimming 
and 
diving 
team 

started 
out 
the 
new 
year 

swimmingly — with a victory.

For the fourth consecutive 

season, the Wolverines ended 
their weeklong training trip in 
Key Largo, Fla., with a win at 
the Orange Bowl Swim Classic. 
Michigan competed in mostly 
sprint races against four other 
schools and finished the day 
with a final tally of 265 points. In 
total, there were seven new meet 
records. Notably, the Wolverines 
were able to place first, second 
and third in six of the races.

“The focus in this meet was 

to execute the details … just 
like the football team did this 
week in their bowl game. It was 
inspirational,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Mike Bottom.

The team gathered to watch 

the Citrus Bowl at a swimming 
and diving alumnus’ house near 
Key Largo. Bottom described 
the trip as the quintessential 
“Michigan experience.”

And when the meet itself 

started, 
the 
Wolverines 

dominated. 
Sophomore 
Emily 

Kopas and freshman Siobhán 
Haughey paced Michigan with 
two wins apiece. Kopas dominated 
in the breaststroke, out-touching 
her opponents in the 50-meter 
race (32.04) and the 100-meter 
race (1:10.57), while Haughey 
placed first in the 100-meter 
freestyle (55.86) and the 200-
meter individual medley (2:14.64).

Rounding 
out 
the 
event 

winners were sophomore Gillian 
Ryan in the 400-meter freestyle 
(4:15.21), sophomore Clara Smiddy 
in the 100-meter backstroke 
(1:01.12), junior Maddy Frost in 
the 50-meter freestyle (26.57) and 
senior Ali DeLoof in the 50-meter 
backstroke (28.32). In addition, 
Michigan won both of the relays 
at the meet.

Despite the success, Bottom 

believes the annual trip to Florida 
between Christmas and the New 

Year’s holiday is more about the 
training than the competition.

“This 
training 
trip 
is 
so 

important 
to 
us,” 
Bottom 

said. “This is a team that is so 
academically 
focused. 
We’re 

under a lot of pressure to reach 
their full potential both in 
academics and in athletics. But 
when we’re here, we’re only 
focused on swimming. Part of our 
objective is to help the athletes 
enjoy each other and the team a 
little bit more.

“We make changes in technique 

better here. Things like starts and 
turns. All of the little things that 
make the champion better.”

Despite the rigorous training 

schedule, the women’s team was 
able to bond among themselves 
and with the men’s team during 
downtime. Activities included 
seeing fireworks, a boat trip and 
eating meals.

But within a week of returning 

to Ann Arbor, the team will be 
getting right back into their 
competition 
season. 
Bottom 

relies on one thing to keep his 
swimmers motivated — focus.

“Focus is a great way to keep 

people moving forward,” Bottom 
said. “There is no time to stop. We 
have to keep moving. That’s what 
the schedule calls for.”

When looking for the types of 

recruits he wants on the team, 
Bottom searches for someone 
who maintains a clear focus and 
the ability to adapt to the team 
atmosphere. To Bottom, it takes a 
certain type of person to be able 
to work through a demanding 
athletic and academic schedule.

“We recruit athletes that are 

going to understand what it takes 
to be a Michigan Wolverine,” 
Bottom said. “It doesn’t mean they 
have it when they come in, but they 
have to be determined. They have 
to have a focus and a direction. 
And they have to put in the energy 
to athletics, academics and their 
community. We recruit athletes 
who understand this. Ninety-nine 
percent of the time we don’t get 
the best recruits, but we get people 
who always improve.”

Five Things We Learned

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

For the first time since 2011, 

the Michigan football team ended 
its season with a win. In one 
of their most complete efforts 
of the season, the 14th-ranked 
Wolverines (6-2 Big Ten, 10-3 
overall) dominated No. 19 Florida 
(7-1 
Southeastern 
Conference, 

10-4 
overall) 
through 
and 

through, putting a finishing touch 
on what Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh called his “favorite 
year in football.”

There were plenty of highlights 

to be found in Orlando. Here 
are five things we learned from 
Michigan’s 
41-7 
Citrus 
Bowl 

trouncing of the Gators.

1. The run game isn’t dead.

After being the motor for 

Michigan’s offense in the first 
half of the season, the Wolverines’ 
stable of running backs sputtered 
to close the year. Yards per carry 
dropped from 4.8 in the first six 
games to 3.1 in the second, and 
yards per game dropped from 
201.3 to 99.

But 
against 
the 
Gators, 

Michigan showed new life on the 
ground. Addressing a strong pass 
coverage and blitz-heavy front 
line, the Wolverines compiled 225 
yards and two touchdowns on 
46 carries. Junior running back 
De’Veon Smith led the way with 
109 yards, while redshirt junior 
Drake Johnson added 58 yards 
and a score.

With the run game and pass 

game both clicking, Michigan’s 
offense looked as good as it had in 
recent memory.

“De’Veon was a man possessed 

running the football,” Harbaugh 
said. “I don’t think I’ve seen our 
offense play better.

“I’ve never seen a back like this 

that breaks as many tackles. Well, 
maybe Frank Gore.”

After 
the 
game, 
Johnson 

noted that the time off from 

games improved the health of the 
bruised backs, and building an 
early lead opened up lanes late in 
the game. But Smith noted that 
a change in mindset was the key 
factor and a good sign with plenty 
of talent coming back next season.

“We just came out there and 

competed today, and it showed 
that work and work and work 
actually pays off,” Smith said. “So 
I know (the Wolverines are) going 
to keep that going on into 2016.”

2. Jehu Chesson is still the 

team’s MVP.

When redshirt junior wide 

receiver Jehu Chesson was named 
the 
Bo 
Schembechler 
Most 

Valuable Player the Michigan 
football team’s annual banquet 
last month, it turned some heads. 
Chesson began the season as 
the pass game’s third option, 
and failed to haul in a receiving 
touchdown until the seventh 
game of the season.

But against Florida, Chesson 

looked 
as 
valuable 
as 
ever, 

totaling 118 receiving yards and 
a touchdown against two-time 
All-America cornerback Vernon 
Hargreaves III.

“Jehu Chesson, the MVP. He’s 

a great player,” Harbaugh said. 
“He’s one of those guys covering 
those kicks, and it was great to 
get a post route. It was great to 
hit that. … I mean, Florida is so 
athletic and has so much speed 
that there’s only tiny windows to 
make those throws and complete 
those catches.”

Chesson ended the season with 

919 total yards and 12 touchdowns 
— nine of which came in the final 
seven games. Despite not even 
being the team’s best receiver 
for much of the season, Chesson 
ended it as the team’s best player.

“Pardon my French, but Jehu’s 

got his shit together,” Johnson 
said of his roommate. “Like if 
there’s someone on our team who 
really has their stuff together, 
Jehu has his shit together.”

3. The defense was an all-

time unit.

Before the game began, many 

expected the Citrus Bowl to be 
a battle of two stout defenses. 
Florida faltered, but Michigan 
held up its end of the stick. The 
Wolverines allowed just 253 
yards, seven points and forced 
two turnovers in the trouncing.

“Our defense was magnificent,” 

Harbaugh said. “The three and 
outs, the stops, the play on third 
down, everybody playing great 
team defense, it was — it was 
really good.”

The performance capped a 

historic season for Michigan’s 
defense. 
In 
an 
era 
where 

scoring is as high as ever, the 
Wolverines finished in the top 
10 nationally in nearly every 
defensive category, and had 
their third-best total defense 
since 1985 — falling short of the 
2006 unit that finished 11-2 and 
the 1997 unit that won a national 
championship.

“I’ve got to give Michigan 

all the credit in the world,” said 
Florida coach Jim McElwain. 
“They took it to us, beat us up 
front, did a great job in the red 
area, kept us off balance and, I 
think more than anything, played 
with a pad level.”

4. One-year quarterbacks can 

still leave a legacy.

Historically, 
one-year 

quarterbacks 
are 
rarely 
a 

good thing for Michigan. The 
title 
was 
usually 
reserved 

for unmemorable starters or 
gunslingers who struggled their 
way out of the position.

But 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock proved 
to be an exception to the rule, 
and was as good as ever Friday. 
Rudock completed 20 of 31 
passes for 278 yards and three 
touchdowns en route to being 
named the game’s MVP.

In the fourth quarter, Rudock 

also became just the second 
Wolverine to throw for 3,000 
yards in a season, and ended 
his career first all-time in 
completion percentage.

“Jake Rudock was fabulous — 

on the money today,” Harbaugh 
said. “I mean, darn-near flawless, 
… getting hit and passes against 
corners that were going to be 
playing in the NFL. He’s going to 
be drafted.”

Though his future in football 

is still uncertain, it’s clear that, 
even with only one season to 
do so, Rudock made his mark in 
Michigan history.

5. BOLD PREDICTION: 
Michigan’s 77-year draft 
streak continues … barely.

For all 77 years of the NFL 

Draft, a Michigan player has 
been selected at some point. 
It’s an impressive feat that only 
Southern California can match, 
but it may be in jeopardy. With 
highly touted prospects Butt, 
Lewis, Chesson and Wormley 
all reportedly staying for next 
season, the Wolverines have 
no 
surefire 
draft 
prospects 

graduating or leaving early.

But after thumping Florida, 

Harbaugh was adamant many 
of his seniors were ready for the 
next level.

“Probably about 10, 11 guys on 

this team that won’t be back next 
year,” he said. “But we’ll watch 
them in August. We’ll take a few 
hours off and watch you guys 
play in the NFL.”

Among the players Harbaugh 

mentioned were senior safety 
Jarrod Wilson, fifth-year senior 
center Graham Glasgow and 
Rudock. Linebackers Joe Bolden 
and James Ross III will also play 
in senior All-Star games.

No draft board has a Michigan 

player being taken, but after 
arguably its best performance 
of the season, expect to see at 
least one player’s name called 
on draft day.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Sione Houma finally had a chance to win a championship in his senior season.

Embattled 

seniors go out 

with a win

O

RLANDO, Fla. — 
Minutes after Friday’s 
Citrus Bowl ended, 

senior fullback Sione Houma 
stood near midfield, trying to put 
on his championship T-shirt. It 
started off as a simple process. 
He put his arms through the 
sleeves with 
ease, eager 
to show off 
his team’s 
victory. But 
then his pads 
got in the 
way, leaving 
the shirt 
rumpled up 
above his 
midsection.

Houma called one of his 

teammates over, and with 
assistance, he was finally able 
to do something he had never 
done in his collegiate career: 
be officially recognized as a 
champion.

Sure, it wasn’t the national 

championship, a Rose Bowl 
championship or a Big Ten 
championship, but for one day, 
it seemed like none of that 
mattered. Friday wasn’t the day 
to minimize Michigan’s feats.

The senior class Jim Harbaugh 

inherited for one season is 
one that arrived just after of 
Michigan’s Sugar Bowl victory 
to cap the 2011 season, right 
before the program suffered the 
downturn that led to the firing 
of Brady Hoke. Among the fifth-
year seniors, only linebacker 
Desmond Morgan played in that 
Sugar Bowl.

The rest of them had never 

appeared in a game that ended 
with them wearing shirts that 
had the words “Michigan” and 
“champions” on the front.

A loss Friday would have 

put Michigan’s seniors in 
unfortunate territory: The last 
four-year period in which the 
Wolverines won neither a Big Ten 
championship nor a bowl game 
culminated in 1968.

The previous three seasons 

for the senior class ended like 
this: a heartbreaking loss in the 
Outback Bowl to South Carolina 
in 2012, a blowout loss to Kansas 
State in the Buffalo Wild Wings 
Bowl in 2013 and them sitting on 
their couches last season while 
10 other Big Ten teams played in 
bowls. Somehow, it did not crush 
their resolve.

“The trust and intensity these 

boys had, given everything that 
happened, we all stuck together,” 
Houma said. “And the bond we 
created, I’ll never forget that.”

They had never experienced 

anything like Friday’s postgame: 
Jake Rudock, Joe Bolden, Joe 
Kerridge and Jehu Chesson 
standing on a podium with a 
trophy they had won, maize and 
blue confetti enveloping them; 
half of a stadium in Florida, the 
state where its opponent resided, 
screaming “It’s great to be a 
Michigan Wolverine”; players 
who not only didn’t want to leave 
the field after the game, but who 
stayed so long to run around and 
give fans high-fives that they 
needed to hustle so they wouldn’t 
delay the team’s TSA airport 

security check on the way out of 
the stadium.

The fans were relentless, 

screaming for Jim Harbaugh, 
chanting his name. But he stood 
to the side of the stage, out of the 
spotlight and among a crowd, 
holding his son Jack in his arms. 
Harbaugh took pictures with a 
never-ending line of fans and 
donors, stopping only to tell 
passing game coordinator Jedd 
Fisch that Friday’s offensive 
performance was as good as he 
has ever seen.

Harbaugh’s handprint on the 

win, on his team, was evident 
through it all. Michigan was 
relentless Friday, pounding 
Florida’s top-10 defense from 
start to finish. Things weren’t 
much different on the other side 
of the ball — Bolden said he was 
surprised Florida managed to 
score seven points. But if every 
day of 2015 was about Harbaugh, 
the first day of 2016 wasn’t really 
about him at all: It was about 
Michigan’s senior class.

Bolden, as much as anyone 

else, is emblematic of the 
struggles of his classmates. His 
teams have suffered through four 
losses to Ohio State, nothing easy 
to cope with for an Ohio native; 
he was ejected from Michigan’s 
game against Michigan State 
for a questionable targeting call 
that changed the complexion 
of the game; and last year, in 
the middle of a 5-7 season, he 
was called upon as one of a few 
team representatives charged 
with frequently explaining the 
inexplicable to the media.

But Friday eased much of 

that pain. There will, Bolden 
noted after the game, be 
a banner commemorating 
this bowl victory hanging in 
Schembechler Hall for decades. 
The final game of his career was 
a victory, and the dominating 
fashion in which they won made 
it all the more satisfying.

“It’s also memorable that 

you beat the runner up in the 
SEC that bad,” Bolden said. “If 
I remember correctly, I think it 
was worse than ’Bama beat them. 
It goes to show that when we’re 
clicking on all cylinders, in my 
opinion, we can beat anyone in 
the NCAA.”

The Wolverines will try to 

prove that in 2016, when this 
year’s senior class has moved on 
to other endeavors. Harbaugh 
will have to try to top this 
year, his favorite season in 
football. He had a team full of 
“jackhammers,” players who not 
only bought into his message, 
but lived it every day. They 
helped bring Michigan back into 
national prominence, and did it 
while mentoring the players who 
will follow them.

And in their final act as 

Wolverines, the senior class 
helped give the younger players 
their first chance to put on 
championship T-shirts. And 
for next time, they’ll have had 
practice. They won’t have to worry 
about the shirts getting stuck.

The good, the bad and the ugly

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
highly 

publicized first year as Michigan 
football coach made stops all over 
the country before wrapping up 
in Orlando, Fla., last week for the 
Citrus Bowl against Florida (7-1 
SEC, 10-4 overall).

The game also concluded 

a season of highs and lows. 
The Wolverines reestablished 
their identity and had twice as 
many wins than their five in 
2014, but they also suffered a 
heartbreaking loss to Michigan 
State and a blowout defeat 
against Ohio State, finishing 
behind both rivals in the Big 
Ten standings.

In 
the 
end, 
Michigan’s 

season finished at a peak. The 
Wolverines (6-2 Big Ten, 10-3 
overall) played their best game 
of the season, dismantling the 
Gators, 41-7, on Friday. After a 
slow start on defense left the 
outcome in doubt for about a 
half, Michigan came out firing 
on all cylinders after the break. 
By the end of the game, most of 
the Florida fans who made the 
short trip to Orlando had left 
the stadium.

The Daily breaks down the 

good, the bad and the ugly from 
Friday’s game:

The good

For 
most 
of 
the 
game, 

everything clicked for Michigan. 
The game MVP was fifth-year 
senior Jake Rudock, who finished 
his career with another strong 
performance by throwing for 
278 yards and three touchdowns 
on 
20-for-31 
passing. 
After 

earning the second-most single-
season passing yards in program 
history, he continued to force 
NFL teams to give him a look.

Perhaps 
the 
Wolverines’ 

standout 
performer 
was 

redshirt junior wide receiver 
Jehu 
Chesson. 
Matched 
up 

with Florida cornerback Vernon 
Hargreaves III — a first-round 
NFL talent who announced 
Monday his intention to declare 
for the draft — Chesson had the 
edge all afternoon. Twice, he 

beat Hargreaves deep — once 
with a double move and once 
on a deep post route — finishing 
with five catches for 118 yards 
and a touchdown. He said he 
didn’t submit for an NFL Draft 
evaluation, so he will almost 
certainly be back in 2016 with 
plenty of chances to be in this 
space again.

More surprising for Michigan 

was the success of the running 
game, which was trending in 
the opposite direction of the 
passing attack toward the end 
of the season. Junior running 
back De’Veon Smith showed his 
ability to break tackles on his 
way to 25 carries for 109 yards, 
making Harbaugh compare him 
to NFL running back Frank 
Gore. Redshirt junior running 
back Drake Johnson and senior 
fullback 
Sione 
Houma 
each 

added touchdowns.

On the other side of the 

ball, the defense feasted on an 
outmatched 
Florida 
offense. 

Senior 
linebacker 
Royce 

Jenkins-Stone 
and 
redshirt 

junior defensive lineman Chris 
Wormley each made sacks, and 
the Wolverines combined for six 
tackles for loss. In their previous 
game, 
they 
surrendered 
42 

points at home against Ohio 
State, so they, too, ended the 
season on a high note.

The success of the offense 

and defense in tandem allowed 
Michigan to possess the ball 
for 11:32 in the third quarter as 
it pulled away and 11:53 in the 
fourth as it ran out the clock. The 
offense rolled down the field, and 
the defense picked up quick stops, 
sending the offense back out and 
wearing down the Gators.

The bad

The 
Wolverines’ 
miscues 

were few and far between in the 
bowl game. A dropped pass by 
junior tight end Jake Butt and 
a touchback on a 57-yard punt 
by senior Kenny Allen were 
both small mistakes, far from 
impactful on the final outcome. 
Michigan’s 
arduous 
bowl 

preparation showed, as the team 
played a clean game.

Off the field, injuries brought 

the season to an early end for 
a couple of players. Redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers 
did not play with a hand injury, 
and fifth-year senior punter 
Blake O’Neill, who had a brace 
on his knee, did not punt in his 

final 
career 
game. 
Redshirt 

junior wide receiver Amara 
Darboh also left the game in the 
fourth quarter when a Florida 
defender ripped his helmet off. 
Darboh did not return.

The ugly

Michigan left little to be 

desired after the first few drives, 
but the defense did show some 
holes early on. Adjusting from 
former defensive coordinator 
D.J. 
Durkin 
to 
interim 

coordinator 
Greg 
Mattison, 

the Wolverines allowed 200 
yards on their first four series 
on defense. Florida reached the 
red zone three times, but threw 
interceptions on two of them.

In their three longest drives, 

the Gators strung together seven 
plays of 15 yards or more: two 
quarterback scrambles and five 
passes. Michigan also committed 
two penalties in that time, the 
only span of the game during 
which the outcome was contested.

When senior safety Jarrod 

Wilson intercepted a pass in the 
end zone in the second quarter, 
the Wolverines halted Florida’s 
momentum and rolled for the 
rest of the game.

Six Ways to Apologize for Starting 
Your Column with a Listicle

Hello, my name is Mike Flynn. The kind 
folks at The Michigan Daily have asked 
me to write a humor column, presum-
ably because they’ve heard my Chew-
bacca impression and concluded that I 
must be pretty funny. As excited as I am 
to embark on this columnal endeavor, I 
must admit that the process of coming 
up with ideas for the inaugural article 
has been as fraught with difficulty as 
this sentence is with overly complicated 
words. After trying several things that 
failed to ignite a comedic fire, I’ve sur-
rendered myself to the same conclusion 
that has birthed countless C+ papers: “I 
just need to get this done.” As such, I’ve 
decided to write this first article for my 
column in the form of a listicle.

There are some who decry the listicle 
as a simple medium that requires little 
effort and diminishes the integrity of 
journalism. While I would normally try 
to defend the listicle’s merits, of which I 
can count at least three, I recognize that 
such an attempt would be futile, given 
that most readers of the Daily probably 
hate listicles. So, in place of an impas-
sioned defense of the medium, I will 
provide a heartfelt apology. As a mat-
ter of fact, I’ll provide a list of six dis-
tinct types of apologies, in order to give 
aspiring columnists something to go off 
if and when they find themselves in this 
same predicament.

1. Denial
I can personally guarantee that this 
article is in no way representative of the 
quality of future entries in this column. 
There will be no more listicles from me. 
I’ll write articles in every form besides 
listicles! Come to think of it, that’d be 
a cool listicle. “20 types of articles that 
aren’t listicles…”

2. Anger
So what if this is a listicle?! Listicles 
are a perfectly legitimate medium! You 
know, the people who discount listicles 
are the same kinds of people who dis-
counted young adult literature, or the 
recent renaissance of Justin Bieber. 
Don’t try to stifle me! All art is valuable, 
motherfuckers!

3. Bargaining
I’m sorry I yelled. It was in the heat of 
the moment. None of you are mother-
fuckers. Here, what can I do to make 
it up to you? I’ll do the Chewbacca 
impression again! “RrrrrrrrrRRrRRr
rRRRRrrrrRRRrrrr!” Jesus, how do 
you type a Chewbacca noise? Is it just 
R’s? Are there vowels?

4. Depression
This sucks. I’m so sorry. This isn’t 
funny. My career at The Michigan 
Daily is over. I totally understand. This 
sucks. I’m so sorry. This isn’t funny. 
This sucks. This sucks. Forgive me.

5. Acceptance
You know what, it is what it is. I’ve set 
out to write a humor column, and there’s 
some humor in this article. There are 
some good lines. Some people will 
probably chuckle. And soon the column 
will become so popular and beloved 
that people will look at this article and 
chuckle at their obliviousness to the 
quality humor that was to come.

6. Uhhh…
Well, I guess I’ve run out of apology 
steam. I’ve completely forgiven myself. 
Laughter really is the best medicine, 
isn’t it? Ha! Haha! Hahahahahahaha-
hahahahahahaha!

THE statement

Had this column been due a few weeks before, you would’ve gotten 500 

words of scathing analysis about the state of higher education and its effects 
on students, as well as an introspective anecdote about family, obligations and 
dreams.

(Heavy, I know, but what can I say? It was finals week and I was under a lot 

of stress.)

But that was all before my dad decided to book a family vacation to Cancun.
The events that transpired during the Madhani family’s weeklong stay in 

southeastern Mexico reminded me why, as a rule, we avoid taking extended 
family vacations too often. It’s worth noting that this was our first weeklong 
international trip together since India in 2011.

If you’re like me and at least barely passed math, you’ll realize that 2011 was 

four years ago, back when sequined Uggs were considered formal winter foot-
wear.

So, without further ado, I welcome you to what I’d like to call, “A Very Blun-

der-ful Madhani Christmas.”

Most people take long breaks in tropical environments for one reason — 

relaxation. However, the first thing you should know about my family is that 
we, collectively, understand that no one at all — save my seven-year-old sister 
— will be calm, cool and collected at any point during said trip.

My father, the breadwinner, funds and plans the entirety of all our vaca-

tions, so any dollar (or various other international currencies) being spent by 
us is bound to send him miniature panic attacks. My mother, with her neurotic 
— and I say this affectionately — nature, has an obsessive need to coordinate 
every outfit with a different pair of shoes/jewelry and make sure that everyone 
is having fun with a capital F.

My brother, the definition of a Type B personality, aggravates my parents 

with his idleness and lack of overt enthusiasm that their aggravation, in turn, 
stresses him out. And I, with my incessant need to be left alone and do every-
thing by myself, find the idea of a family vacation an obstacle to my leisure.

The collision of these four very complex personalities always results in 

an inevitable crash and burn, but our trip to Cancun was a disaster from the 
beginning.

Tragedy struck at baggage claim — we realized that our single checked bag 

was nowhere to be found. The night before our flight, my mother had care-
fully folded each of her outfits, selected her jewelry and shoes accordingly, and 
packed her new perfumes in the MIA bag.

After being told by Delta personnel that the bag had, in fact, arrived at the 

Cancun airport, my family and I inspected each of the bags in every aisle 
before coming to the conclusion that someone else had picked it up from the 
airport and accidentally taken it home. My mother looked like she was about 
to burst into tears. I think she might have preferred a “Home Alone” scenario 
with any of her children over losing her brand new dress from J. Crew.

But she comforted herself with the fact that we would soon be headed to 

settle into our home for the week, what we thought would be a three-bedroom 
house (key word here being “thought”). Something must have gotten lost in 
translation, because the house was, in fact, an apartment with one bedroom 
that had three glorified couches, a bathroom with no door and — the mother 
loads — no air conditioning for 90 degree south-of-the-border weather.

My father is livid at this point — remember, he pays for all of this stuff and 

once wrote a Starbucks customer complaint so stern that he received several 
free drink vouchers. He attempts to contact as many hotels as possible to find 
us other accommodations, but to no avail. We decide to crash there for the 
night, spend the next day exploring Chichen-Itza and then deliberate what our 
next move should be.

One of the few things I’ve retained from one of my intro-level classes is that 

every good story has a fairy godmother who rescues the princess from her des-
titute conditions. Although we were far from destitute, really, just extremely 
uncomfortable in our small quarters, our angel came in the form of Hernando, 
the sales representative for Palace Resorts and Spas.

After a chance encounter at his booth at Chichen-Itza, where he really took a 

liking to us, and a pizza dinner, Hernando convinced my family and I to visit a 
decadent resort called Moon Palace.

Another thing you need to know about my family is that we are what my 

roommates Sharon and Tanvi would call a “scheme squad.” We will do literally 
anything to score free stuff, including sitting through a 90-minute presenta-
tion about timeshares we weren’t going to buy at a hotel we wouldn’t think of 
living at just for a free breakfast and 30 percent discount on theme park tick-
ets.

When the 90-minute presentation turned out to take almost five hours to 

get through, our planned beach day was effectively ruined. But, in the end, we 
emerged relatively unscathed when my dad struck a deal with the Moon Palace 
sales rep that allowed us to stay in one of their satellite hotels for the rest of our 
vacation.

It was a torn-dress-to-glass-slippers moment, truly, but it wouldn’t last long. 

While this was the most miraculous thing to happen to us in Cancun, the vaca-
tion was determined to continue downhill. As I’m nearing 1,000 words in this 
column, I realize there’s no way I can do justice to what more there is to come.

My father forgetting the tickets to the theme parks in the hotel and having 

to drive back in heavy rain, resulting in a fender bender, along with a black cat 
crossing our path on the way back to the hotel; my mother’s new starch-white 
handbag receiving its own seat on the flight back and possibly spotting one of 
my good friends’ dad at Moon Palace — these are some of the stories I still have 
left to tell.

I’m not saying we need our own National Lampoon movie, but we probably 

need our own National Lampoon movie.

My Cultural Currency: A very blunderful Christmas

5C

Editor’s Note: The name of a student has been changed 
to protect the privacy of a source currently involved in the 
FlexMed admissions process, denoted with an asterisk.

“Just about here, in the second paragraph, you write that when you got to college you 

decided to work harder for better grades.”

My pointer finger was hovering over a piece of paper positioned on a table between 

Wyatt*, a student I met ten minutes ago, and myself. His paper was overcrowded with black, 
single-spaced text. Wyatt was writing his personal statement.

Wyatt is a sophomore at the University of Michigan applying to a FlexMed program 
 
— an 

early application process for undergraduate sophomores looking to guarantee early accep-
tance to medical school 
— at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

“You go on to show me how rewarding getting good grades has been for you, compared 

to the grades you got in high school, and you articulate pretty well that you are a driven 
student … which is good.”

Wyatt’s writing was strong, but it seemed to be missing something: his writing needed 

to prove to admissions officers that this change in getting good grades is significant in his 
growth as a person. I can tell that, for Wyatt, this failure to get good grades in high school is 
somehow crucial, but the ‘somehow’ is not clear for the reader and maybe not for Wyatt too. 

I felt challenged with the task of figuring this out for Wyatt — talking to him just enough 

so that he eventually, through wonderings and mumblings with me, exposed why his 
change was so crucial.

As a peer consultant at the University of Michigan’s Sweetland Center for Writing, I work 

for four hours every Sunday night in a small room in the basement of the Alice Lloyd Hall 
dorms where students bring their essays for workshopping. According to Sweetland’s Peer 
Writing Center System Statistics Report, this past fall 6.7% of students brought their per-
sonal statements for graduate programs, internship programs or job applications. Last fall 
7.26% students brought personal statements. The fall semester before that 3.9% of students 
did.

“What was the turning point?” I asked Wyatt. Wyatt’s head arches upward toward me; 

his eyes don’t quite meet mine.

“What made you decide that you were going to get better grades?” I clarified. “Was it 

really just looking at your high school transcript at the end of senior year, that was the turn-
ing point? Or was there something else, some other repercussion? What truly made you 
realize it was important to work harder?”

Wyatt hesitated and then told me that if he was being honest, it was after he got rejected 

from so many colleges. He felt horrible. Quickly after, he noted doubtfully that he couldn’t 
write that in his personal statement. That would make him look like a failure to a FlexMed 
admissions board.

“The personal statement” is a very real noun in today’s dictionary. The page it’s on in that 

dictionary is fairly worn if you are a young adult. At the early age of seventeen we are asked 
to write a 500-word document for various college admissions boards. Many undergraduate 
students will write another personal statement when applying to a study abroad program, 
again when applying to an internship program, again when applying to graduate schools, 
and possibly many more times when applying to jobs as graduation creeps closer.

In April 2014, The New York Times wrote, “Enrollment at American colleges is sliding, 

but competition for spots at top universities is more cutthroat and anxiety-inducing than 
ever.” U.S. News and World Report calls it a “right college” frenzy. The Atlantic says the 
myth of colleges becoming more selective is both true and untrue. Whether universities are 
becoming more selective or not (they are, technically, but there are still plenty of spots for 
students — just not plenty of spots at the top schools), there is a demanding emphasis placed 
on how to best get into college.

The application process has been picked apart and formulized: 3.6 GPA plus 1950 SAT 

score plus five extracurricular activities plus a personal statement equals accepted or reject-
ed. Despite the formulation of the college admissions process, the most human part of this 
entire process, and arguably the most important part, is the personal statement. So just like 
the GPA, the SAT and the extracurriculars, does the personal statement have a coefficient 
in front of it? Does it have an equation that if satisfied with the right values produces the 
right results?

In September 2015, University of Michigan’s College of Literature, Science and the Arts’s 

Newnan Advising Center piloted a small program that specifically advises students on their 
personal statements for medical, law and graduate school. The pilot program, headed by 
Academic Advisor Christopher Matthews, is a collaboration among several advisers: five 
writing consultants, plus Newnan’s pre-law advisers, who offer sessions for law school-
specific applicants, and pre-health advisers, who do the same for med school applicants. A 
service somewhat resembling this was previously offered through the University’s Career 
Center.

According to Kerin Borland, the director of the Career Center, the center decided last 

spring to stop offering their personal statement advising services. They saw students 
through the summer months but discontinued the service last September. Borland explained 
that the center’s intention in working with students on their personal statements was to talk 
about presentation and telling their story, but in reality they found themselves correcting 
students’ spelling, sentence structure and theses. It became less of a “career issue” and more 
of a “writing skills issue,” Borland said.

When asking Matthews, Pre-Health and General Academic Adivsor David Brawn and 

Pre-Law and General Academic Advisor Denise Guillot how they instruct students on their 
for-college personal statements, it’s clear not a single one of them is studying the personal 
statement as a curriculum. It’s because there isn’t a curriculum per-se. Instead, personal 
statement advisers at the Newnan Center follow a combination of their past experiences in 
the field, their past experiences working with personal statements and their interactions 

by Claire Bryan, Editorial Page Editor

with admissions officers.

Guillot, one of two pre-law advisers, was 

e-mailing the Law School a series of ques-
tions about how to deal with students writing 
about sensitive issues like health problems or 
learning disabilities the Friday morning I 
went and spoke with her.

“I try to get really specific feedback about 

how admissions people respond to that 
kind of deeply personal issue,” she said. “It 
is important for students to be able to talk 
about it. And to be able to talk about it in a 
way that is constructive is really important 
in the personal statement.”

This type of communication is common. 

Guillot consistently invites representatives 
from law schools around the state to come 
talk to her and her students. Every year there 
are both national and regional pre-law advis-
er networks that host conferences where 
advisers and admissions officers meet. Both 
Guillot and Brawn sit in and watch admis-
sions work.

“They’ll be very explicit with us,” Brawn 

remembered. “Saying please tell your stu-
dents that we need to hear these things: If 
we can’t see some sense of cultural humil-
ity, if we can’t see some genuine caring for 
the patients that they worked with, then we 
don’t care if they have a perfect MCAT and a 
4.0, they aren’t getting into med school.”

The words were rolling off Brawn’s tongue 

faster than I could write in my purple note-
book. When he paused to take a breath, I 
jumped in, awkwardly.

“But does it feel genuine? Is what those 

admissions officers are saying to you really 
what they are looking for when reading a 
personal statement?”

I was thinking about Wyatt and the com-

petitive FlexMed application process he is in. 
Do colleges expect more from the personal 
statement because they are really trying to 
find a connection with the student? Or are 
consultation services that strive to generate 
these perfectly crafted statements, maybe 
the very one I’m involved in, just players in 
this cutthroat admissions game? Are our 
efforts, of making a student find some con-
nection with his growth and articulate that 
on page, worthy efforts?

Brawn smiled a bit and sat up straighter in 

his chair.

“I was surprised the first time I got to sit in 

on an admissions committee work,” he said. 
“The language that I saw was like communi-

ty, is she going to be happy here? What does 
he really know about medicine?”

Brawn’s words painted a room for me: 

There are people who have various com-
mitments sitting around a table. Someone’s 
there whose emphasis is research, someone’s 
there whose emphasis is diversity, someone’s 
there who is specifically trying to provide 
a different perspective. Sometimes there’s 
even a student on the committee. As a whole 
they are trying to put together a class that 
clicks. They want this person to join this 
community and have the people in the com-
munity better off because this student is in it. 
They see the profession as a community. So, 
they’re asking: Is this person going to carry 
the reputation of this school forward? Is this 
a person I want to work next to?

Brawn’s picture made me think of the per-

sonal statement with so much more weight 
and importance. The personal statement 
process — when stripped of the commer-
cialized, cutthroat culture of writing the 
best personal statement that so many high 
schools, websites and outside college coun-
seling firms talk about — is the powerful 
gateway that determines if someone is going 
to be a doctor.

Sitting around the table of my high school’s 

“The Craft of NonFiction” class, we all had 
secrets. My classmates and I were exactly 
who Pollack was talking about, the genera-
tion who looked to the literary world of mem-
oir to know how to write about ourselves. 
Our summer reading had been Dave Eggers’s 
memoir “Heartbreaking Work of Stagger-
ing Genius,” our class discussion the week 
before was all about Joan Didion’s “Goodbye 
To All That,” an essay about her navigation 
as a young adult living in New York City. We 
weren’t anyone significant at the table if we 
didn’t have a story to share. In dangerously 
thick waters of comparing our tragedies with 
others’ tragedies, we wrote real writing that 
helped us grow as young adults. But at the 
end of the day we were cutting sentences, 
ideas, thoughts, reworking structure and 
adding shameless plugs of leadership charac-
teristics not for ourselves, not to share with 
our peers, but for that “caffeinated wretch” 
who David has put in all of our minds. At the 
end of the day, we were exposing our vulner-
ability for potential gain in a college process. 
We were marketing our troubles as tangible, 
manageable and “overcome-able” to show 
colleges, to show our world around us, that 
we were good enough. But if those colleges 
didn’t like that, didn’t like everything we had 
overcome on paper, they could — and usually 
did — reject us.

For Guillot, the pre-law advisor, one of the 

most interesting parts of the job comes when 
she sits in front of students that don’t feel 
they have a story to tell. “I try to ask them to 
try to just talk to me. Sometimes when you 
think about the challenges of telling a story 
it is the process of writing that is stopping 
them.”

They can tell a verbal story just like they 

talk to their friends about something that 
happened to them or to family members,” 
she continued. “But somehow translating 
between verbal and written is hard for a lot 
of people. I will ask them to tell me about 
something they experienced while they were 
a college student that had an impact.”

The hardest part of the job and one of the 

most fundamental truths when it comes to 
these personal statements is that there are 
appropriate topics and inappropriate top-
ics. There are students who may mentally be 
going back in their memory many times to 
something but it may not be the proper thing 
to write about for a professional program.

“You have to find positive ways to tell them 

it is not going to work,” Guillot said. “If you 
do a good job with the personal statement 
you position someone to see themselves in a 
new way, ideally with a greater understand-
ing of their agency, a greater sense of where 
they want to go next and why.”

Guillot shared that students aren’t always 

there, in terms of understanding or connec-
tion, when writing their personal statements.

“If the student is not ready to see the con-

nection between their experience and their 
skill, I don’t force it on them. I try to talk to 
them about it, I try to pull it out and ask prob-
ing questions, try to get them to see.”

“If they don’t see it and it’s not genuine or 

sincere then that is not what their statement 
should be about,” Guillot’s eyes looked up. 
“And it is okay, they need to be who they are 
and their personal statement needs to reflect 
where they are at in life.” 

The University of Michigan’s campus, 

along with every college campus, is filled 
with literary magazines and newspapers 
that print personal statements. A literary, 
more artistic version of what we are asked 
to do for college admissions boards. In high 
school I tried to weave my own story into 
500 words. I wrote about a series of events: 

my siblings going away to college and leaving 
me, the youngest sibling, behind, my parents’ 
marriage fumbling apart and back together 
again, my move out of my childhood home. 
This was one way to put what was going on 
in my life into words. And though you could 
argue my writing was for an admissions 
board, marketed and packaged, couldn’t you 
say the same thing about the writing being 
published in these magazines and newspa-
pers advertising the lives of our generation’s 
confessional writers? Via competitive admis-
sions processes and literary magazines pop-
ularity, we seem to be asked and encouraged 
to expose ourselves a whole lot more than 
our parents’ generation ever was.

I told Wyatt about my creative nonfiction 

class in high school where we wrote our per-
sonal statements. I asked him to think about 
how getting rejected from colleges made him 
learn something about himself. I waited for 
him to think, to dig deep and tell me some 
secret about his life. I was hoping, maybe 
more because of my own attraction to story 
telling, that he would give me something I 
could help him expose, market and package 
for an admissions board. Something he could 
write about, love the sound of, and know was 
a new, significant part of who he is.

anger 
or 

sadness or jealousy, 
because it will just 
work. We’ll all fuck 
and dance and eat 
and drink and watch 
the stars in the sky 
and feel the water on 
our toes. Maybe we’ll 
all look like we’re 21, 
or maybe we’ll look 
however we damn 
well please and we 
won’t have to worry 
about that anymore.

Maybe 
we’ll 
be 

able to rewind time. 
Maybe all those for-
gotten 
memories, 

where I cuddled with 
a girl or danced in a 
puddle or put togeth-
er a puzzle with my 
grandma, will all be 
back and clear as day. 
Maybe it’ll all make 
sense: why there’s 
something instead of 
nothing, why I, back 
down on Earth, got 
to listen to Rubber 
Soul and be stung by 
a bee and do pretend-
karate and clean the 
dirt off of my kitchen 
floor.

I mean, I deserve 

that, 
I 
think. 
I 

haven’t 
been 
the 

most charitable per-
son and I haven’t 
always 
been 
the 

best friend to every-
one, but I did all 
my schoolwork and 
I never killed anybody. Maybe when I’m clutching the 
sheets of that hospital bed at age 79 or twitching under 
those truck tires at age 23 I won’t feel any pain. Because 
maybe I’ll already have left my body, and maybe it’ll be 
like sliding down a waterslide but going up, up, up.

Once, I read some article on VICE or somewhere 

about a group of people that made an atheist church. I 

remember in the pictures the speakers smiled, and the 
congregation danced and laughed. One of the speakers 
talked about how happy he was just to be alive and how 
he was happier not buying into anyone’s doctrine.

I wish I could be like those people. But I don’t think 

I can. I don’t think I could even be one of those smarmy 
“enlightened” atheists who people on Reddit like to 
make fun of. I think becoming an atheist was the worst 
thing that’s ever happened to me.

It’s not like I wanted to be a non-believer. I don’t want 

to think, like Brenda from “Six Feet Under” did, that 
death is just “dreamless sleep forever and ever.” It’s not 
like I wanted to picture myself rotting under the ground, 
maggots crawling from my arms and legs and my dick 
falling off. I don’t want my relatives who were slaugh-
tered in the Holocaust to have just died.

I didn’t decide to stop believing — it just happened. I 

can tell you exactly when it did: I was nearly passed out 
on the floor of my friend’s dorm room at Michigan State, 
high on dabs and drunk on Hams and Admiral Nelson, 
and something about the way the room swirled or my 
head throbbed or my stomach churned made me feel like 
I was there, I was inches from that eternal black void, 
that maybe I wasn’t that Young Adult novel protago-
nist after all, that maybe I was going to die right then 

and there, sprawled out in 
fucking East Lansing next 
to expired condoms and a 
DVD copy of “Pirates of 
the Caribbean.”

For me, being an atheist 

isn’t fun or rewarding or 
enlightening in any way. 
It sucks. It’s definitely not 
“freeing,” like some people 
say. Sure, I guess I don’t 
have to wake up early on 
Sunday. I can masturbate 
without thinking about 
the moral implications of 
doing so. OK — not hav-
ing to worry about Hell is 
pretty nice.

But for the most part, 

not believing just feels 
claustrophobic. I’m in a 
mental prison of my own 
making, and I’m holding 
the key, but I just can’t fit 
it in the lock. It makes me 
hate the sack of bones and 
brains and fatty tissue in 
which my consciousness 
is stuck.

As an atheist, all I can 

see are little asterisks 
everywhere. These things 
I’m experiencing, these 
conversations and sunsets 
and bugs and birds and 
burritos, they matter to 
me, but they don’t really 
matter. Not to the sun or 
the stars or the universe 
slowly dying a heat death. 
You can tell because of the 
asterisks, those black Ann 
Arbor crows that dot those 
sunsets, those little stains 
of piss on your underwear, 
that homeless guy, sitting 
in front of NYPD, who 
you might eventually give 
some of your PlayStation 
money.

If you’re reading this 

and you believe in something, hold onto that heaven or 
reincarnation or subjective reality or whatever it is for as 
long as you can. Losing your religion is like losing every-
thing. I would trade my doubt for your belief any day of 
the week if I could.

So, believe. Believe as hard as you can. Trust me — I 

would if I could.

Personal Statement: I know all the word’s to Eminem’s ‘Lose Yourself’

H

igh school. For me, it wasn’t anything that I 
thought it was supposed to be. Wasn’t it supposed 
to be filled with rites of passage? At the very least 

there were supposed to be one or two moments of intense 
experience from which I could learn. There were supposed 
to be moments and experiences, times and transitions. I 
was supposed to fight and kiss and abuse and destroy and 
build and rebuild. I was supposed to start something — 
tangible or intangible. Right? I was supposed to leave high 
school in preparation for college or for the supposed “real 
world.”

But, alas. I attended a private, Catholic all-girls school 

in Buffalo, New York. It has maintained the title of “Best 
Private School Education” in the area for over a decade. It’s 
competitive, and it’s tough. I kept good grades throughout 
high school, and I studied voraciously for the SAT and ACT. 
I would need them to get into a far, far away college, spe-
cifically New York University (this story does eventually 
stop being so incredibly cliché). I worked the soundboard 
for every school musical. I played piano in the orchestra. I 
was co-president of my school’s Mock Trial team. I spent 
most winter weekends memorizing fake affidavits or open-
ing statements for the competitive trials. I played soccer 
for two years before being promptly cut from the team my 
junior year. I ran cross country and track for the remainder 
of high school. Both cross country and track wanted more 
participants, so I joined them. Of course, I was, stereotypi-
cally, very unathletic.

My average week held incredible structure: I went to 

school, then I attended one of my various extracurricular 
activities. I arrived home in the family minivan around six 
or seven, ate dinner, did my homework and practiced the 
piano if I had time. My weekends were consumed by Mock 
Trial, cross country, homework and, luckily, friends. On 
the weekends, my six closest friends and I would meet at 
our favorite restaurant, Red Robin, order something Angus 
and then sneak out extra steak fries into the movie theater 

across the street.

I remember being very frustrated. But it was a quiet frus-

tration, one that rarely leaked out of my mind and one that I 
myself barely understood. I think it was just that I had read 
too many J.D. Salinger books, seen too many John Hughes 
movies and listened to far too much bad ’80s music. I would 
go on long drives in my little, white Honda Civic. I thought 
I was edging on artistic to drive with no destination. With 
my music blaring, I thought it was romantic of me to drive 
45 minutes away to a popular hiking spot at the edge of 
Buffalo. I — ever so dramatically — felt as though, if I drove 
fast or far enough, I’d leave my suburban boredom behind.

I was feeding the angst that was constantly probing my 

mind. The angst was the same as that self-deprecating 
mindset that told me my seemingly ordinary day-to-day 
life had to be better. I had strange expectations for myself 
that even I did not yet understand. I craved something cre-
ative. I wanted an artistic outlet of some sort. Fuck, I think 
I just wanted to feel something, or understand something 
that couldn’t be found between the pages of my AP Ameri-
can History textbook.

So, all this confusion, frustration, anxiety, irritation 

and obsessive behavior had to materialize into something. 
It eventually did, my senior year, in a particularly strange 
form. This pent-up “I think I’m artistic or creative but I 
don’t know how to be or what that even means” feeling was 
released with the help of Detroit’s own number one white 
rapper, Eminem.

I’m no Eminem aficionado. I mean, I support and respect 

his art. I do think he is a phenomenal rapper. His rhymes 
are clever, and his tone is usually so aggressive that it can 
be undeniably entertaining. Sometime in the summer lead-
ing up to my senior year of high school, I found the piano 
composition for Eminem’s biggest hit, “Lose Yourself,” on 
an online sheet music website. I downloaded it, learned 
the piece and its lyrics one lazy summer day, and let the 
knowledge rest in my mind palace. I’d play it upon my lit-

tle sister’s request or for the fun of it with friends. Music 
brings people together — even shitty raps. So, I don’t want 
any of that “what was your taste” judgment. We’re all on 
separate sonic journeys. And it took me a while to find good 
rap music.

I performed Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” in my school’s 

talent show my senior year of high school. I told my sis-
ter and my six friends what I was doing, but on the sign-
up sheet I simply wrote, “Mimi Zak performance.” I had 
to hide my piece from the teachers in charge of the event. 
Chalk full of expletives and ‘inappropriate’ content, “Lose 
Yourself” would never make it past their strict eyes. And 
so I kept it quiet. It wasn’t until 20 minutes before my per-
formance, when one of the administrators finally asked me 
what I would be performing, that I was reprimanded.

“You can’t perform that. Who told you that you could 

perform that piece? I can’t allow you to perform that piece.”

But I didn’t listen. I knew there was not enough time 

for this one particularly vapid woman to stand between 
me and what I thought was going to be the greatest per-
formance of the school talent show. I went on to perform 
the piece. I sang the chorus and rapped the rest. I played 
perfectly. Halfway through the performance, the micro-
phone fell off the stand. And no one could hear what I was 
saying, but that was OK. I didn’t need them to hear about 
Eminem’s dark Detroit struggle. I think it was important to 
me that I actually just did it.

At the time, I didn’t know why I performed “Lose Your-

self” as a solo, acoustic performance at my private, all-girls 
Catholic school my senior year of high school. But when I 
retrospectively analyze my former situation, this was just 
part of my self-actualization process. My life could be dif-
ferent and artistic and romantic. I could be unordinary. 
Banality wasn’t my reality — it was just the demon that my 
self-doubts manifested themselves into.

I just wish I picked a different song. Mimi, really, you 

could have picked any other song.

share photos from their winter breaks in Michigan and Connecticut.

I’ve always loved watching the Detroit Red Wings, so I was ecstatic to add this 

new ornament to our family’s Christmas tree.

Members of the children’s choir draw between scenes of “A Christmas Carol” put on by the St. Joseph First United 
Methodist Church in St. Joseph, MI.

I visited the St. Joseph Lighthouse in my hometown. Icy temperatures and waves caused a lot of ice buildup on 
the structure.

Before I flew home, I watched the snow fall from my porch in Ann Arbor.

My dog, Cody, naps in front of the fire in my home in Niantic, CT on Christmas Eve.
