Washtenaw
culmination of
4-year process
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Washtenaw Avenue, the 4.5-
milb road that stretches through
Ann Arbor, is known by most
students for its fast traffic, prox-
imity to fraternity houses and as
a straight-shot route to Whole
Foods Market.
However, the street has been
a thorn in the city's side for years
due to its precarious crossings
and transit options, as well as
inadequate sidewalks. After four
years studying the roadway, offi-
cials in Ann Arbor and surround-
ing communities have planned a
number of improvements to make
the road safer and more acces-
sible.
Nathan Voght - the project
manager for ReImagine Washt-
enaw, a regional study to evalu-
ate the road's condition - said
his first goal has been to look for
ways to improve safety.

"(Ann Arbor officials) wanted
to undertake a process of pub-
lic engagement to try to deter-
mine how the corridor could be
transformed into one that's more
attractive, that's safer, that's
something that will thrive and
encourage economic develop-
ment and really be a corridor that
will meet its potential," Voght
said.
Voght said pedestrian transit
developments such as foot and
bike paths are also a focus of the
study, adding that the community
has been frustrated that these
ideas have been ignored.
"(In the past) there's been very
little planning and coordination
to make sure that improvements
that are made really look at the
quality of life along the corridor
and access to the corridor and
other ways of transportation to
get around, specifically bikers,
etc.," Voght said. "This has been
something we are now looking
into."
Some projects have already
been completed in the area
between Pittsfield and Ypsilanti
Township, and others in Ann
Arbor are in the planning or con-
struction phases, Voght said.

The University's Athletic
Department withdrew from the
2013 Big House Big Heart char-

ity run because it would prefer
to host a similar event indepen-
dently in the future, Athletic
Director Dave Brandon said in
an interview on the 1290 WLBY
radio station Wednesday morn-
ing.
Brandon told WLBY that the
race is "a good idea," but mon-
etary donations to charitable
organizations can be increased
if the University's collaboration

with Champions for Charity, the
group that has organized the
event for the past six years, is
ended.
"If we can get more money
routed to the charities because
there isn't a profit motk, we're
always going to prefer to go that
route," he said.
He added that the Athletic
Department considers various
aspects of a charity's organiza-

tion when considering a part-
nership, including management,
finances and cooperation with
the department.
The Big House Big Heart race,
which was scheduled for April
14, offered participants 10-kilo-
meter, five-kilometer and one-
mile distances with all races
culminating at the Big House's
50-yard line.

$60,000 grants
aimed to promote
interdisciplinary
research activity
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
For faculty clamoring for to
fund research initiatives, they
now have the opportunity to
vie for 150 additional $60,000
research grants in the sec-
ond round of the University's
MCubed program.
MCubed is a new University-
run program that funds faculty
research projects through a
semi-random selection process.
Each faculty member is eligible
for $20,000, but must pair up
with two other researchers to
form a "cube" that covers at
least two different academic
disciplines.
The first round of funding
awards' were announced via
Twitter last month. Projects
that received funding included
research on environmental law,
lung cancer treatments, can-
cer stem cell.vaccination and a
possible pill that is thought to
mimic exercise.
Valerie Johnson, the pro-
gram's managing director, said

the $15-million project was
designed to award 200 grants
over the course of its two-year
pilot period. With the success
of the first round announced in
November, coordinators of the
program have decided to con-
tinue into the second phase to
provide maximum opportuni-
ties to interested faculty.
"We really want to enable
faculty members to get stu-
dents and other hires in place
for January," Johnson said.
"Because our first cubing phase
was so successful, we decided
to move quickly and distribute
the next batch of 150 cubes."
Johnson said it is difficult to
predict the number of faculty
members applying for grant
money for projects. In last
month's round of 50 grants,
MCubed received 127 applica-
tions. As of Wednesday, the
first day the program's website
was open to submitting applica-
tions, there were 72.
Unlike the announcement
of the first rounds on Twit-
ter, Johnson said this time the
selected projects will appear on
the MCubed website as soon as
possible after the application
process closes at noon on Dec.
17.

In panel talk,
professors discuss
state of national
research efforts
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
The fourth-floor Rackham
Amphitheatre was filled to
capacity on Wednesday night

as panelists and the University's
physics community gathered
to discuss one of the greatest
unsolved mysteries of modern
physics: the Higgs boson.
Nicknamed the God Particle,
the Higgs Field, proposed by
Peter Higgs and other scien-
tists in the 1960s, provides an
explanation for why subatomic
particles, such as quarks and
electrons, have varying masses.
The theory states that particles
interact with the field in varying

degrees, leading to differences
in masses.
The particle was discovered
at the ATLAS lab of the Large
Hadron Collider near Geneva,
Switzerland last summer. The
LHC is part of the larger Euro-
pean Organization for Nuclear
Research, also known as CERN.
The Higgs boson is consid-
ered the smallest manifesta-
tion of the Higgs Field and is
extremely difficult to detect,

TWINKLE TOES

Capturing creativity

What classes are you
teaching this semester?
I took over Professor Chris
Peterson's positive psychology
class after he passed. Just this
Monday, we showed students a
DVD of his last lecture, where
he said, "You should teach your
lecture as if it's your last one,"
but obviously he didn't know
his last one would be the last
one. I teach small seminars
now on creativity and also
work with prospective indus-
trial designers in the College of
Engineering.
Where are you from?
I'm from Minnesota. I've
been in Michigan for 20 years.

I came here as a professor and
during the first few years, I
taught intro psychology classes
a lot.
How did you become
interested in researching
creativity?
My main interest is in how
people's responses and ideas-
can be different from each
other and how one's ideas can
be surprising to others, in a
sense that your idea that's not
so surprising to you could be
surprising to somebody else.
How does creativity play a
role in everyday life?
One really interesting exam-

ple is just at the coffee bar.
How often do you hear just a
standard latte, and how often
do you hear soy, caramel, dou-
ble shot - to the pofnt where
you want to say, 'Why don't
you just make it for yourself?'
... Making choices is a demand,
so people take shortcuts and
have a go-to drink just so that
they don't have to think about
what they really want to drink
every time they're faced with
this option. But it also puts
you in a rod. You stop experi-
encing. You don't try the gin-
gerbread latte that you might
really like.

Pentagon begins planning for
massive budget reduction K

Fiscal cliff would .
trigger $500 billion
in budget cutbacks
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Defense Department has begun
planning for the roughly $500
billion in personnel and pro-
gram cuts over a decade that
will be needed if Congress and
the White House fail to reach a
deal that would avoid the double
hit of tax hikes and automatic

spending reductions dubbed the
"fiscal cliff."
Department spokesman
George Little said the cuts
would be "devastating to our
national defense."
As the White House and
members of Congress continue
to wrangle over how best to
find as much as $1.2 trillion in
savings over the next 10 years
to avert the fiscal cliff, Little
said the Pentagon started more
detailed discussions this week
on how to slash 9.4 percent of its

budget across the board.
He said cuts that deep could
force the department to throw
out its new military strategy,
and cut weapons and technol-
ogy programs, and it could ham-
per the department's ability to
provide for its troops and their
families.
He added that the depart-
ment also is beginning to fig-
ure out how it will prepare and
inform about 3 million military,
civilian and contract workers
about the cuts, if they occur.
For months, Pentagon offi-
cials have insisted they were not
planning for the massive budget
cuts thot would automatically
kick in after the first of the year
if the White House and Con-
gress doesn't strike a deal. But
with less than a month to go and
no deal in sight, those evalua-
tions have begun in earnest.
According to guidance sent
out by the White House Office
of Management and Budget, the
Pentagon will have to slice near-
ly 10 percent off more than 80
accounts, including more than
$4 billion off Air Force aircraft
and maintenance, $2.1 billion
off Navy shipbuilding; $6.7 bil-
lion off Army operations, $3.2
billion off health programs and
$1.3 billion out of the Afghan
security forces funding.
About $55 billion of the $500
billion in cuts would come in
the first year.
The Pentagon would have
some flexibility in deciding
how to find the money in each
of those broad categories; for
instance officials could leave
the aircraft carrier fleet intact
and take the money out of other
types of ships in the pipeline.
If the White House and law-
makers are able to avoid the fis-
cal cliff, the military still likely
will be looking at as much as an
additional $10 billion to $15 bil-
lion in cuts in projected defense
spending each year for the next
decade. It's a prospect that
Republicans recognize is the
new reality, with wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan ending and
deficits demanding deep cuts.

Instrumental
in shaping 20th
century music
You don't have to be a jazz
aficionado to recognize "Take
Five," the smoky instrumental
by the Dave Brubeck Quartet
that instantly evokes swinging
bachelor pads, hi-fi systems and
cool nightclubs of the 1950s and
'60s.
"Take Five" was a musi-
cal milestone - a deceptively
complex jazz composition that
managed to crack the Billboard
singles chart and introduce a
new, adventurous sound to mil-
lions of listeners.
In a career that spanned
almost all of American jazz
since World War II, Brubeck's
celebrated quartet combined
exotic, challenging tempos with
classical influences to create
lasting standards.
The pianist and composer
behind the group, Brubeck died
Wednesday of heart failure at a
hospital in Norwalk, Conn. He
was a day shy of his 92nd birth-
day.
Brubeck believed that jazz

presented the best face of Amer-
ica to the world.
"Jazz is about freedom within
discipline," he said in a 2005
interview with The Associated
Press. "Usually a dictatorship
like in Russia and Germany will
prevent jazz from being played
because it just seemed to rep-
resent freedom, democracy and
the United States.
"Many people don't under-
stand how disciplined you have
to be to play jazz.... And that is
really the idea of democracy -
freedom within the Constitu-
tion or discipline. You don't just
get out there and do anything
you want."
The common thread that
ran through Brubeck's work
was breaking down the barri-
ers between musical genres -
particularly jazz and classical
music. He was inspired by his
mother, a classical pianist, and
later by his composition teacher,
the French composer Darius
Milhaud, who encouraged his
interest in jazz and advised him
to "keep your ears open" as he
traveled the world.
"When you hear Bach or
Mozart, you hear perfection,"
Brubeck said in 2005. "Remem-

ber that Bach, Mozart and
Beethoven were great impro-
visers. I can hear that in their
music."
Brubeck was always fascinat-
ed by the rhythms of everyday
life. In a discussion with biogra-
pher Doug Ramsey, he recalled
the rhythms he heard while
working as aboy on cattle drives
at the northern California ranch
managed by his father.
The first time he heard
polyrhythms - the use of two
rhythms at the same time - was
on horseback.
"The gait was usually a fast
walk, maybe a trot," he said.
"And I would sing against that
constant gait of the horse. ...
There was nothing to do but
think, and I'd improvise melo-
dies and rhythms."
Brubeck combined classical
influences and his own innova-
tions on the seminal 1959 album
"Time Out" by his classic quar-
tet that included alto saxophon-
ist Paul Desmond, drummer
Joe Morello and bassist Eugene
Wright.
It was the first jazz album lo
deliberately explore time signa-
tures outside of the standard 4/4
beat or 3/4 waltz time.

Settlement issue
overshadows
Netanyau's trip
to Germany

Egyptian riot police stand guard during clashes between supporters and opponents of Egyptian President Mohammed
Morsi outside the presidential palace in Cairo, Egypt, Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2012.
IslamHists battle protests
as crisis grows in Egypt

Europeans unhappy
with Israeli plans to
build in West Bank
BERLIN (AP) - It was sup-
posed to be an amicable meeting
between close friends. Instead,
Israeli Prime Minister Benja-
min Netanyahu's visit to Ger-
many has been souredby Berlin's
refusal to oppose a Palestinian
U.N. statehood bid and anger
throughout Europe over Israeli
plans to expand settlements
around Jerusalem.
The sensitivity of Netanya-
hu's trip to one of Israel's closest
allies in Europe offers a taste of
the increasingdispleasure on the
continent at his government's
seeming intransigence, particu-
larly over Jewish settlements on
lands the Palestinians want for a
future state.
Europeans, however, appear
at a loss to develop an effective
strategy of their own to pres-
sure Israel to move forward on
a moribund peace process with
the deeply divided Palestinians.
And it was unclear how hard
Germany was prepared to push
the Israelis.
The European Union came
nowhere near a united front
when the U.N. General Assembly
voted last week to upgrade the
Palestinians' diplomatic status
- effectively recognizing a Pal-
estinian state in the West Bank,
east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip,
territories captured by Israel in
the 1967 Mideast war.
In a slap to Israel, its clos-
est European allies - Britain,
Germany, Italy and France - all
abstained or voted with the Pal-

estinians. The Czech Republic,
where Netanyahu stopped on his
way to Berlin, was the only EU
country to join the U.S. and Isra-
el in voting against the measure.
Germany's decision to
abstain rather than vote against
a Palestinian state shocked Isra-
el and sets the scene for tense
talks between Netanyahu and
Chancellor Angela Merkel on
Wednesday night and Thurs-
day. The issue overshadowed
the two governments' official
program of cooperation on sci-
ence, education and business at
an annual meeting of their two
Cabinets.
Israel's next move heated
the atmosphere further: Its
announcement Friday that it
would move ahead on plans to
build 3,000.settler homes in a
strategic corridor near Jerusa-
lem. Palestinians said the settle-
ment, whose construction would
be years away, effectively cuts
the West Bank in two and breaks
the link between the West Bank
and east Jerusalem -- their
hoped-for capital.
"It would be insincere to
hide the fact that I was disap-
pointed by the German vote at
the United Nations - like many
people in Israel," Netanyahu
told the German daily Die Welt.
"I think Chancellor Merkel

Demonstrators
voice discontent
with constitution
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt descend-
ed into political turmoil on
Wednesday over the constitution
drafted by Islamist allies of Presi-
dent Mohammed Morsi, and at
least 211 people were wounded as
supporters and opponentsbattled
each other with firebombs, rocks
andsticksoutside the presidential
palace.
Four more presidential aides
resigned in protest over Morsi's
handling of the crisis, and a key
opponent of the Islamist presi-
dent likened Morsi's rule to that
of ousted authoritarian leader
Hosni Mubarak.
Both sides were digging in for
a long struggle, with the opposi-
tion vowing more protests and
rejecting any dialogue unless the
charter is rescinded, and Morsi
pressing relentlessly forward
with plans for a Dec. 15 constitu-
tional referendum.

"The solution is to go to the
ballot box," declared Mahmoud
Ghozlan, a spokesman for Morsi's
Muslim Brotherhood, asserting
the charter was "the best consti-
tution Egypt ever had."
The clashes outside the presi-
dential palace in Cairo's Heliopo-
lis district marked an escalation
in the deepening crisis. It was
the first time supporters of rival
camps fought each other since
last year's anti-Mubarak uprising,
when the authoritarian leader's
loyalists sent sword-wielding
supporters on horses and cam-
els into Cairo's Tahrir square in
whatbecameoneoftheuprising's
bloodiest days.
The largescale and intensityof
the fighting marked a milestone
in Egypt's rapidly entrenched
schism, pitting Morsi's Broth-
erhood and ultra-conservative
Islamists in one camp, against
liberals, leftists and Christians in
the other.
The violence spread to
other parts of the country later
Wednesday. Anti-Morsi protest-
ers stormed and set ablaze the

Brotherhood offices in Suez and
Ismailia, east of Cairo, and there
were clashes in the industrial city
of Mahallah and the province
of Menoufiyah in the Nile Delta
north of the capital.
Compounding Morsi's woes,
four of his advisers resigned,
joining two other members of his
17-member advisory panel who
have abandoned him since the
crisis began.
Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading
opposition reform advocate, said
Morsi's rule was "no different"
than Mubarak's.
"In fact, it is perhaps even
worse," the Nobel Peace Prize
laureate told a news conference
after he accused the president's
supporters of a "vicious and
deliberate" attack on peaceful
demonstrators outside the palace.

Don't allow open season for private sellers
This week, a House-passed bill is up for discussion in the
Michigan Senate that eliminates background checks and
licensure for buyers of privately sold guns. Though the
nationally licensed gun dealers still would fill out the routine paper-
work, House Bill 5225 would eliminate these prerequisites for buy-
ers purchasing from private sellers - in person or online. Michigan's
current model is not the most effective at preventing and solving
crimes, but this law would make purchasing guns even easier while
increasing the difficulty of tracking down criminals. Our country
needs a stricter and more organized form of gun control - Michigan
is no exception. With the passage of this law, we would not only be
ignoring this need, but taking a step in the opposite direction.

Et tu, feminists?

Don't let Katy Perry's pyro-
bosoms fool you - this fire-.
work is no bra burner.
Last Fri-
day, Perry was x
awarded the title
of Billboard's
Woman of the
Year, narrowly
beating out Octo-j
mom and that
lady down the MELANIE
street who hands KRUVELIS
out pennies on
Halloween. And
as her first offi-
cial piece of Queen 2012 business, the
singer of "Ur So Gay" just wanted to
get her politics straight.
"I'm not a feminist," Perry said
in her acceptance speech, "but I do
believe in the strength of women."
Thanks for the qualifier,Katy.
Perry.isn't alone in her tm-no-
Feminazi-but-hey,-equality! stance.
Carla Bruni, the former first lady of
France, recently drew flak for her
own statements about the current
state of women's liberation.
"we don't need feminists in my
generation," Bruni said in a Decem-
ber 2012 interview with the French
edition of Vogue magazine. The ex-
premiere dame continued, sayingthat
she loves family life, doing the same
thing every day, and all the other
splendors of the "bourgeois lifestyle."
Ergo, she can't be a feminist.
Sigh. Et tu, Bruni?
Now, before I overfeed the Inter-
net trolls, let me be clear - it's OK if
you're not a feminist. There's noth-
ing inherently wrong with Perry
kissing off the feminist label, or
Bruni's snub of the movement all
together. But when you moderate
your rejection of feminism with this
nebulous "strength of women" bit,
you get the sense that maybe, just
maybe, Perry actually does support
the tenets of the women's movement.
She just doesn't like the stigma that
comes along with it.
In other words, when you reject
feminism, you've got to realize that
you're rejecting more than andro-
cide and braless anarchy. You're
rejecting an ideology that says, at
its core, women should live on equal
terms with men.
Ironically enough, this aver-
sion, or meh attitude, toward femi-
nism reinforces the need for it.

Or at least, the need for a better
understanding of what it means to
be a feminist. Because if the ques-
tion is "who's afraid of the big bad
'F-word' ", these days the answer is,
well, pretty much everyone.
Why are these women backing
away from feminism? Or better yet,
why does any statement praising
gender equality have to be qualified
with a "but seriously, feminists are
so annoying"? For that answer and a
migraine, we turnto Suzanne Venker.
On Nov. 26, Fox News published
her editorial "The War on Men,"
which claimed that the real victim in
the battle of the sexes is guys. In her
piece,Venker threw up the caucasi--,
I mean, white flag, asking women to
"surrender to their nature." In other
words, be a lady and would you
please quit it with the feminist pop-
pycock? It's ... unsightly.
Venker's logic goes somethinglike
this: Women are angry today. Which
means they look like feminists.
Which means they aren't women. Oh
yeah, and we're all going to die alone.
See that? That link between femi-
nism and unqualified, unwomanly
anger? While Venker and others
color this link as a causal relation-
ship, it only takes about 15 minutes
in a Statistics 250 lecture to realize
just how baseless that claim is. Femi-
nism is not the ideology of the angry
lady mobs. To borrow from histo-
rian Cheris Kramarae, feminism is
"the radical notion that women are
human beings." Connecting this idea
to mass castration is a vast totaliza-
tion of the theory. And a really crap-
py one at that.
Take, for instance, feminist lit-
erature. Sure, Barnes and Noble
might put "The Feminine Mystique"
in the same section as "The SCUM
Manifesto." But does that mean that
Betty Friedan, the author of "Mys-
tique," wanted to eradicate all men
as per the manifesto? Probably not.
Just like Tyler Perry doesn't repre-
sent all black filmmakers, "SCUM"
author valerie Solanas doesn't rep-
resent all feminist writers. Pointing
at the extremes and shouting "Look,
I found feminism!" undermines the
real intent of the movement - which
again, is that women should be
judged as individuals, rather than a
product of their gender.
But maybe you're like Bruni. Maybe
you think we don't need this dated

ideology anymore. After all, women
made incredible strides in the last
year alone. In November's election,
20 women earned seats in the Senate
- the highest number of female seats
in U.S. history. But simple subtraction
revealsthat 80 percentofsenators are
male. These numbers are even more
startling in the boardroom. In 2012,
only 4.2 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs
were women - a number CNN called
"a milestone."
And returning back to Bruni's
France, I doubt Olympe de Gouges
would be impressed by the cur-
rent state of women in the so-called
country of human rights.
'Surrender' to
gender roles? I
don't think so.
In response to Bruni's comments,
French female senator Laurence
Rossignol tweeted, "As long as I
get asked whether I'm the senator's
assistant, the next generation will
need feminism." Then there was
the 2011 French initiative Action
Relooking, where a handful of
"lucky" unemployed French women
get a government-sponsored make-
over, to help them "look prettier" for
job interviews.
And that's not even mentioning
worldwide struggles for women's
rights among racial, LGBT and
socioeconomic lines. Which, for a
self-proclaimed gay rights activist
like Perry, might be of interest.
So what's so bad about feminism?
Maybe we don't like owning up to
the fact that there's still work to do.
Social progress isn't moving as fast
as Apple cranks out iPhones - and
yeah, that's a little bit scary. But
rejecting a philosophy based on the
outliers doesn't get us anywhere.
If you accept the idea that men and
women are equal in value, if you
accept the notion that women should
be judged as people and not a gender,
then to nuance Jeff Foxworthy -
well, you just might be a feminist.

One of the major arguments for the bill is
that the current system is expensive to main-
tain and that this money could be put to bet-
ter use. Supporters say that with the federal
restrictions already in place, the money spent
on the state system is a redundant waste. How-
ever, statistics show that almost half the gun
sales in Michigan are transacted through pri-
vate sellers, and documentation for these sales
would no longer be required. The police argue
that these records are sometimes the key factor
in finding and prosecuting criminal suspects.
The claims that funding is being squandered
on this system crudely discount the urgency of
bringing a violent criminal to justice.
The faith in the competency of the federal
gun control system as a catchall for criminals
is misplaced. In numerous instances, such as
the Aurora shootings, people with criminal
intent purchased guns at federally registered
stores. The problem is that background checks
only question the existence of mental illness or
a criminal record. Underlying mental stability
or intentions for purchase aren't considered
relevant. But even with these gaps in the sys-
tem, a flawed paper trail is still better than

none at all. In Indiana, where a similar bill was
passed into law, buying a gun is as easy as pick-
ing one from a gun show.
Our country is quickly being singled out
for its resistance to gun control. In other
countries such as Canada, the United King-
dom and Australia, most firearms are banned
outright. Civilians who wish to purchase a
gun must prove a genuine need to do so and
usually must prove they are trained in han-
dling the weapon. Although the data con-
necting restrictive gun laws to fewer violent
crimes is inconclusive, the call for stricter
gun control is not only logical, but also is sup-
ported throughout the world.
The state senate should not pass this pro-
posed law. Relaxing gun control is the exact
opposite of what needs to be done and the pas-
sage of this law could lead to further attempts
to weaken the system. The federal system
itself must be strengthened so that people like
James Eagan Holmes no longer slip through
the cracks. Many countries have already real-
ized the dangers behind the free sale of hand-
guns and have taken appropriate measures. It's
time we follow their lead.

Crowd- souCin bias

On Dec. 5, John Bracken, founder of the
Knight News Challenge, heard pitches by envi-
ronmental journalism students in North Quad
as part of the class's Pitchfest event. The Knight
Foundation works to engage communities and
foster journalistic innovation.
The pitches I heard while attending this
conference focused on engaging consum-
ers with news by allowing them to respond
as reporters. Two groups pitched ideas for a
web site and smart phone application com-
bination that would allow readers to search
for specific topics, organize their web pages
with desirable information and upload their
own videos, pictures or articles for commu-
nal benefit. The idea was meant to direct-
ly employ the reader and make use of the
instantaneous nature of the Internet to com-
pile news from every possible source. They
wanted average citizens to be responding to
and creating their own news reports.
Newspapers are dying. None of the ideas
I heard talked about print articles - it was
all about the Internet. It was about engaging
readers online, not with a physical paper. The
Knight Foundation asks for innovation because
new ideas are needed to keep the newspaper
industry alive. When news is so freely and
abundantly accessible online, it's difficult for
pricey print publications to compete.
However, everyone knows the inherent risks
of online news - namely, the limited means
we have to check the credibility of a news arti-
cle. People trust The New York Times or The
Washington Post as valid sources for national
and economic news, but only trust Yahoo News
when it comes to Kate Middleton's pregnancy.
High-ranking papers are trusted to have good
reporters, strong fact-checkers and careful
editing. Citizen uploads are not, which is why
forums like Reddit are purposed for entertain-
ment, not as news sources.
On-the-spot video and photo reader uploads

are priceless and informative during a natural
disaster; however, this could easily be abused in
day-to-day life, decreasing the credibility of the
website. As a journalist, of course I want news-
papers - whether online or print - to survive,
but I don't think crowd-sourcing reporting is
the way to keep readers interested.
Readers like to be part of the conversation.
Comments sections and letters to the editor
prove the desire for readers to have a voice in
their news, but these submissions are often
either biased or downright false.
One of the judges for the Knight News
Challenge, Steve Dorsey, vice president of
research and development at the Detroit
Media Partnership, said "it is frustrating
that (The New York Times) reporters can't
respond to (online) comments that are false."
Newspaper policy often forbids report-
ers from chiming in the comments section,
meaning a lot of what you see in comments
could be misleading or downright false.
By using citizen uploads as their primary
news source, the reader will be engaged, but
not as well informed. The pieces aren't prop-
erly edited or provided by someone trained
in journalism. While this doesn't necessar-
ily mean their reporting is misrepresenting
facts, it does mean that I, along with others,
have less faith in it.
Newspapers are the place people go to become
informed by an unbiased teacher on important
issues. While it's foolish to think that any news
story is completely unbiased, editors and writers
make a concerted effort to maintain objectivity.
Citizen uploads don't receive the same profes-
sional scrutiny. Soon, there may be no resource
for people to educate themselves and make their
own opinions because no article will be trusted'
to be presenting the truth. And that will be the
final nail in the newspaper's coffin.

J so a Nov. 19 e-mail to Yale Uni-
versity faculty, Dean Mary
Miller discouraged the practice
of administer-
ing take-home
examinations to
students. Accord-
ing to "Miller
discourages take-K

Miller's e-mail, ROHAN
prompted by the
recent Harvard
University cheating scandal, primar-
ily underscores the time burden of
take-home tests.
"We try to help faculty members
think about the zero sum of student
time," Miller writes, acknowledging
that without the time-cap of an in-
class exam, take-home tests often take
students much longerto complete.
In late August, reports surfaced
alleging that up to 125 Harvard stu-
dents cheated on a take-home gov-
ernment final, collaborating with
one another on essay questions and
thereby violating exam protocol. As
the school decides how it will pro-
ceed, the controversial scandal con-
tinues to raise questions over the
legitimacy of take-home exams.
With finals fast approaching, the
concerns raised by Miller's e-mail,
as well as by the Harvard scandal,
resound strongly within our own
community here at the University,
where take-home examinations are
frequently administered.
Miller's nod to the Harvard
cheating scandal seems to consid-
er take-home exams an avoidable
opportunity for students to cheat.
Ostensibly confirming her concerns,
a recent study on college cheating
finds thatcheating on written work -
a common component of take-home
tests - occurs at a much higher rate

than cheating on traditional exams.
In a poll of more than 64,000
undergraduates, 24 percent of stu-
dents admitted to "receiving unper-
mitted help from someone on an
assignment" and 42 percent admit-
ted to "working with others on an
assignmentwhen asked for individu-
al work." By contrast, only 8 percent
of those polled about in-class exams
admitted to "using (unauthorized)
crib/cheat notes" and 9 percent to
"copying from another student on a
test/exam with their knowledge."
The potential for increased cheat-
ing - though a legitimate concern
- shouldn't determine the future
of effective and fairly administered
take-home exams. As University of
Michigan students, we ascribe to an
honor code that "prohibits all forms
of academic dishonesty and miscon-
duct."Thoughexampolicies willvary
according to professor and class, our
obligation to the University's honor
code remains unchanged. A test for-
mat should not be altered to antici-
pate potential violations of that code.
In addition to allowing for the
increased possibility of cheating,
Miller contends that take-home
exams can place additional stress on
students as an undue time burden.
Here at the University, midterms
and finals are usually allotted for a
length of time roughly equivalent
to the given class period. So, for a
90-minute lecture class, the final
is normally 90 to 120 minutes long.
Without an enforced timeframe,
take-home exams sometimes ask
students for an amount of work
which would vastly exceed the allot-
ted in-class time.
Additionally, even if a take-home
test does not demand work that nec-
essarily exceeds its would-be in-class
time limit, diligent students will
often work overtime on the heavily
weighted exam. Asa result, the take-
home exams cuts into time students

might use to prepare for other finals.
However, when one considers the
countless amount of time students
spend preparing for an in-class
exam, a take-home test may actually
pose less of a time burden. By allow-
ing a student to complete the work
on his own time, take-homes can
even alleviate student stress.

Potential
cheating can't
nullify take-
home exams.

Furthermore, some privilege the
take-home format over traditional
exams, deeming them more effective
at measuring a student's command
of material. Prof. Scott Lyons, for
example, views take-home exams as
useful indicators of a student's prac-
tical grasp of class material.
"I consider take-home essay exams
to be an important part of my larger
assessment arsenal," Lyons said. "My
exams ask students what they know
and my essay assignments ask them
to do something interesting or use-
ful with that knowledge ... the take-
home exam serves as a kind of bridge
betweenthose two differenttasks."
By specifying an appropriate word
count and providing instructions that
reflectreasonable expectations, Lyons
ensures his take-home exams do not
unfairly burden his students. Taking
into accountthese preventativeguide-
lines, there is certainly room, and per-
haps necessity, for take-home exams
at the University.

' alum urges students to
take risks to receive rewards

Jon Sobel address
students at Zell
Entrepreneurship
event
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
At an address Wednesday as
part of the Zell Entrepreneur-
ship and Law Program speaker
series, University alum Jon
Sobel urged students to take
risks in order to reap rewards.
Sobel spoke to an audience
of more than 50 Law and Busi-
ness students, professors and
administrators as part of the
speaker series, hosted by ZEAL
to connect speakers with back-
grounds in business and law
with current University Law
and Business students.
ZEAL was launched in fall
2011 and funded by Sam Zell,
who graduated from the Uni-
versity Law School in 1966
and founded Equity Group
Investments, a Chicago-based
investment company. The pro-
gram aims to connect business
students seeking legal advice
to law students looking for a
practical application of what
they learn in class, and offers
courses specific to law students
who are interested in entrepre-
neurship.
Sobel graduated from the
University Law School in 1990
* and has since worked for many

major companies, including
Yahoo, Tesla Motors and CBS.
He most recently became CEO
of Sight Machine, a company
that develops technology to
improve manufacturing.
Sobel's presentation, titled
"Risk: Frameworks for Law
and Life," focused on how
risk relates to entrepreneurial
thinking. Sobel encouraged his
audience to welcome risk, rath-
er than constantly try to fight it,
adding that it "is always dwell-
ing in the background ... but you
cannot create something unless
there's risk." ,
At the conclusion of his lec-
ture, Sobel discussed the risks
he took while working with
Tesla, a company that manu-
factures electric cars. He
described how at one point,
the company was losing.money
by spending more on the pro-
duction of cars than they were
earning from the sales, forcing
them to procure a government
loan.
He said the company's
actions sparked debates con-
cerning whether or not Tesla
would survive, but he point-
ed out that the company was
simply managing its risks and
seeking to "identify if a deci-
sion increases catastrophic
risk ... and plan for graceful
failure."
"Tesla is masterful at taking
risks intelligently," Sobel said.
Sobel also discussed his first
years working with Yahoo, dur-
ing which the company was

dealing with up to 40 lawsuits
at once. Some of these issues
were worth several million dol-
lars, whereas others were based
in reputational risks, he said.
Sobel advised attendees to rec-
ognize the importance of mone-
taryversus personal value when
dealing with lawsuits involving
high-profile businesses.
Sobel said communication
and presentation skills. are
essential for students looking to
go into business, stressing the
importance of strong commu-
nications skills not only in law
and business, but in life.
-He added that he wasn't quite
sure how going to law school
would help him at first, explain-
ing the common thought pro-
cess at the time was that being a
lawyer was a foolproof method
for success.
"I wrote off (my time in law
school) as a waste," Sobel said.
"But now I'm so glad that's
what I did."
He also cited the structured
thinking he learned to perfect
in law school as an important
tool for his success.
"That enabled all the other
stuff I did after (law school),
and I never would have expect-
ed it," Sobel said.
Sobel concluded his speech
with words of wisdom that
were met with a rousing round
of applause.
"Fight to win with every-
thingyou have," Sobel said. "It's
the only way you will continue
to grow."

even at the LHC. Only one in a
billion particles produced resem-
bles a Higgs particle. The large
numbers of undesired results
are referred to as "background"
events, which must be separated
before the data can be analyzed.
Additionally, the few Higgs
particles produced decay after
approximately one-billionth
of a second. The decayed par-
ticles take on three different
forms, requiring three unique
approaches by physicists to mea-
sure their presence.
Physics Prof. Gordon Kane,
the director emeritus of the
Michigan Center for Theoreti-
cal Physics, presented a gen-
eral background of the Higgs
research and its impact on the
Standard Model - an overarch-
ing set of principles that define
the majority of physical interac-
tions in the universe.
"The long term goal of par-
ticle physics is to understand
as well as we can the laws of
nature," Kane said. "The discov-
ery of the Higgs boson is the last
step in completing the Standard
Model."
An announcement this July
said a CERN lab had detected a
"Higgs-like particle," but more
analysis of the data is required
before a confirmed result can be
published.
In the 1980s, the Univer-
sity was a key proponent of a
U.S.-based supercollider, an

experimental device used to test
particle theory. The project was
initially approved by the Bush
administration, but halted in
1992 after funding was canceled.
Physics Prof. Homer Neal dis-
cussed the proposal and subse-
quent demise of the project.
"The supercollider is basically
just a big microscope," Neal said.
"We needed a machine in the
mid-80s when we were ready to
start working at smaller distanc-
es and higher energies."
Several of the panelists
expressed their belief that the
U.S.-based supercollider would
have made the discovery of the
Higgs particle long before the
recent discovery by the CERN
laboratory in France and Swit-
zerland.
"If it were on schedule, they
would have turned it on in 1996
and found it within the first
year," Kane said.
At the time of its discontinu-
ation, the project had already
spent $2 billon and constructed
15 miles of underground tunnels
in Texas. Neal said University
researchers, many of whom took
sabbaticals to help with the facil-
ity's design, were distraught at
the project's death.
"Most of our faculty were just
outraged that our country would
cancel the (supercollider)," Neal
said. "Many swore they would
not join a large project like this
again."
Through personal negotia-
tions and meetings, Neal said
many faculty members were
eventually convinced to return

to their work at the University.
Recently, U.S. involvement in
the European LHC is threatened
due to the recent closure of the
Tevatron Collider outside of Chi-
cago, also prompted by a lack of
funding. Historically, American
access to CERN has been contin-
gent upon equal European access
to this facility.
"A lot of Europeans use that
machine, so it was okay for us
to use the CERN facilities - we
presumed some sort of balance
there," Kane said. "It's a whole
new ballgame now."
Regardless of the lack of
U.S. funding, the panelists all
acknowledged the significance
of the discovery for the larger
physics community.
Jay Chapman, a professor
emeritus of physics, delivered
a portion of the presentation
titled "Physics in the Extremes,"
in which he discussed the large
scale implications of the project
and precise nature of the mea-
surements and findings.
"We'te looking for the small-
est things known to man with
the largest device ever built,"
Chapman said.
Chapman also noted the dif-
ficulty in organizing such a mas-
sive international project, with
contributions coming from 173
institutions in 40 different coun-
tries.
"We have to coordinate 3,000
people collectively and ina com-
mon direction," he said. "There
are a lot of very big egos, but
there's an immense amount of
talent."



WASHTENAW
From Page 1A
In September, officials broke
ground for the construction of
Arbor Hills Crossing, a 90,000
square-foot retail and professional
office space located across from
Whole Foods Market, which is
located at 3135 Washtenaw Ave.
The development will intro-
duce safe transit features like
new, wider sidewalks, a new Ann
Arbor Transportation Author-
ity bus stop, a traffic signal and
pedestrian crossing at Platt
Road.
Voght said while the study is
constantly developing projects
on the corridor, several improve-
ments to the road are still years
from completion. He said there
are also plans to redesign paths
between building and the road so
that they are more accessible for
pedestrians.
Former Ann Arbor City Coun-
cilmember Tony Derezinski, who
lives off of Washtenaw Avenue,
has been a proponent of work on
the road before the formation of
the initiative, which launched
shortly after he was elected to the
Council four years ago. He said,
living near the road, he always
felt it was something that needed
improvement.
"I've watched it get busier and
busier and more congested and
I felt very strongly that this was
a an urban issue that needed to
be addressed," Derezinski said.
"When I got elected to City Coun-
COMPUTER

the ones students use daily to
post on Facebook and work on
class assignments, informa-
tion is stored in a binary format
as zeroes and ones, which are
called bits. Calculations are per-
formed as different sequences of
binary encoding information.
Quantum computers, how-
ever, can store these sequences
as zeroes and ones separately
like a traditional computer, but
can also store sequences with
both zeroes and ones at the same
time, called qubits.
Lawson, who assisted in con-
trasting the measurement meth-
ods and collected much of the
project's data, said the concept
could be easily explained by
visualizing a device with rows of
switches.
"You can think of it like this:
I am trying to convey a message
to you with a bunch of switch-
es," Lawson said. "In a classi-
cal computer, you look at the
switches which are all either
up or down and translate a mes-
sage. In a quantum computer,

cil it was one of the first things
which I indicated to the mayor I
wanted to work on and some peo-
ple were already getting together
to tryto share information."
Derezinski said so far the group
has dealt with the road's problems
well, addressing them in the "spir-
it of cooperation" with nearby
communities.
"It was time we really took a
look at it not just in the view of
Ann Arbor, but also in collabora-
tion with all the communities that
this avenue services," Derezinski
said.
Several nearby communities
have partnered with Ann Arbor
in the effort, including Pitts-
field Township, Ypsilanti and
Ypsilanti Township. Local orga-
nizations and governments -
including the AATA, Ann Arbor/
Ypsilanti Regional Chamber of
Commerce, Michigan Depart-
ment of Transportation, Washt-
enaw Area Transportation Study
and Washtenaw County - have
also been participating parties.
Derezinski said one project
currently in development would
ease non-motorized transporta-
tion on the road. The Michigan
Department of Transportation
is constructing paths on both
sides of Washtenaw Avenue
near US-23, which will allow
for pedestrians and bicyclists to
safely travel beneath the high-
waynoverpass.
"Right now we are partial-
ly completed with a walkway
underneath US-23 so you can
get there without fear of losing
all the switches are either up,
down, or a single switch could
be both up and down. With the
third option, I can encode much
more information with fewer
switches."
The idea of quantum comput-
ing is not new - Li said it's been
around for more than a decade.
But Li, Lawson and Hor's recent
discovery uncovered the cop-
per-doped bismuth selenide
that contains Dirac electrons, or
electrons that can outperform
regular electrons by allowing
"switches" to be up, down or
both at the same time.
Lawson compared the mate-
rial to silicon for classic com-
puters, and said it could be the
key building block for quantum
computers. Copper-doped bis-
muth selenide is considered a
topological superconductor,
meaning they conduct energy
indefinitely and have enough
energy to process classical and
quantum physics.
"That's the beauty of that
scheme," Li said.
Although Li and his team
were not the first researchers to
theorize copper-doped bismuth
selenide could contain the Dirac

your life," Derezinski said. "And
I think that is great for students
who live in this community."
While Derezinski was defeat-
ed in his run for second term on
City Council, he said he will con-
tinue to work on the initiative.
He still serves on the city's plan-
ning commission and oversees
the project development for the
ReImagine Washtenaw initia-
tive, and said he will continue to
inform councilmembers of plans
on Washtenaw Avenue.
Jim Kosteva, the University's
director of community rela-
tions, wrote in an e-mail that the
University is happily awaiting
improvements along the road.
"Although the University
does not have direct stake in the
ReImagine Washtenaw initia-
tive, we are supportive of the
improvements in mobility for
the entire community," Kosteva
wrote. "There are sustainability
benefits that we all share with
improved public transportation
and safe accommodation for
alternative modes."
Kosteva noted that the Uni-
versity is especially looking
forward to several services,
including increased bus service
in the corridor, expanded night-
time service and a park-and-ride
that will directly benefit Univer-
sity members.
"I'm confident that all of these
improvements will be used and
enjoyed by a large number of UM
faculty, students and staff who
live in this vicinity," Kosteva
wrote.
electrons needed for quantum
computation, they were the first
to actually detect them, thus
proving the theory correct.
But students shouldn't expect
to complete their CTools assign-
ments on a quantum computer
anytime soon. Lawson said stu-
dents don't interact with quan-
tum computers because they
don't yet work as efficiently as
classical computers.
Still, many students use classi-
cal computers to do complicated
calculations, which takes a long
time.
"Quantum computers hold the
promise of being able to do these
computations much faster," Law-
son said. "The technology is not
there yet, but there is a lot of
potential."
Lawson said further experi-
ments are necessary to ensure
potential topographical super-
conductors behave in ways the
initial research has shown. Fur-
ther research initiatives will
then attempt to find ways to
employ their properties in user-
friendly quantum computers.
"We are on the ground floor
of these materials," Lawson said.
"There is a long road ahead."

RACE
From Page 1A
Champions for Charity wrote
in an e-mail to Big House Big
Heart participants notifying
them of the cancellation that
it offered to yield the race to
the oversight of the Athletic
Department in exchange for use
of the stadium, but the depart-
ment was no longer interested
in holding the event.
According to the e-mail,
which was also posted on
the charity's website, Chrissi
Rawak, the senior assistant ath-
letic director for development,
and Rob ademacker, assistant
athletic director for facilities
and operation, told the char-
ity in a Nov. 30 meeting the
race doesn't fit into the Athletic
Department's plans.
The e-mail stated that
Rademacker and Rawak's deci-

sion was "based on a several
month long evaluation of. our
charitable work and relation-
ships and need to streamline
and organize those efforts."
The organizers of the race
said in the statement they were
unaware of the Athletic Depart-
ment's re-evaluation process.
They said they had agreed on
the date of the event and the
price for renting the stadium,
but were waiting for the "final
'OK"' from Brandon to open
registration, promote the race
and assist non-profits with fun-
draising.
After the race was cancelled
by the Athletic Department and
the organizers offered to hand
over control of the race, they
"made it clear how much the
race means to each participant,
volunteer, committee member
and the many charities," the
statement said.
The statement also thanked

participants and non-profit
organizations for their role in
the event's success over the
past six years and encouraged
charities to fundraise through
the 2013 Ann Arbor Marathon,
which the group also organizes.
It singled out a few key actors
in appreciation for their efforts,
including the University's ath-
letes and coaches, Ora Pescovitz,
the University's executive vice
president for medical affairs,
Timothy Slottow, the University's
chief financial officer, and Uni-
versity Provost Philip Hanlon.
"We know the extraordinary
race finish has always been
dependent on UM Athletics
allowing access to the stadium
and that priorities do change
with administration changes,"
the charity said in the state-
ment. "Our heartfelt thanks
goes out to the thousands of
people who were inspired by the
race."

Syrian violence spills
over into Lebanon

Fighting breaks out
after three killed in
Syria last week
TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) -
The families of Lebanese men
killed in Syria last week say their
relatives were more interested in
nice clothes and vacations than
fighting a civil war. Yet Syrian
President Bashar Assad's regime
branded them foreign jihadists -
and their deaths set off three days
of new spillover violence.
Gunmen loyal to opposite
sides in Syria's civil war battled
Wednesday in the streets of the
Lebanese city of Tripoli. The
fighting has killed six people and
wounded nearly 60 since Mon-
day, security officials said.
The bloodshed is a sign of
just how vulnerable Lebanon is
to getting sucked into the Syr-
ian crisis. The countries share a
porous border and a complex web
of political and sectarian ties that
is easily enflamed.
Among the 17 Lebanese men
who turned up dead in Syria last
week were Bilal al-Ghoul and
his childhood friend, Malek Haj
Deeb, both 20. Malek's older
brother, Jihad, said the two men
sympathized with the rebellion,
but they were not fighters.
"Malek used to see the vid-
eos of dead Syrians and cry,"
Jihad Haj Deeb told The Associ-
ated Press in Tripoli, as gunfire
and explosions echoed near his
home in the poor neighborhood
of Mankoubeen. "He used to say,
'May Bashar fall soon, God will-
ing.'
A giant poster hung in the
entrance of the home, with pho-
tos of three of those killed in
Syria and a sign that read: "Our
dead are in heaven, and yours are
in hell."
Haj Deeb and Bilal al-Ghoul's
older brother, Omar, said the men
must have been kidnapped and
handed over to Syrian authorities
by a pro-Syrian Lebanese group.
They said their brothers were
not members of any political or
Islamic group but were observant
Muslims.
"My brother doesn't know how
to hold a rifle," Haj Deeb said.

The Lebanese men killed in
Syria were Sunni Muslims, like
the majority of rebels trying to
overthrow Assad's regime. Assad
and much of his inner circle
belong to the Alawite sect, which
is an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
The fighting in Lebanon comes
at a time of deep uncertainty in
Syria, with rebels battling gov-
ernment troops near Assad's seat
of power in Damascus.
In Brussels, U.S. Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clin-
ton reiterated concerns that "an
increasingly desperate Assad
regime might turn to chemical
weapons" or lose control of them
to militantgroups.
She also said NATO's decision
on Tuesday to send Patriot mis-
siles toTurkey's southern border
with Syria sends a message that
Ankarais backed by its allies. The
missiles are intended only for
defensive purposes, she said.
Turkish Foreign Minister
Ahmet Davutoglu was quoted
Wednesday in the Turkish news-
paper Sabah as saying that Syria
has about 700 missiles, some of
them long-range.
Syria has been careful not to
confirm it has chemical weapons,
while insisting it would never use
such weapons against its own
people.
But as the regime wobbles,
there are fears the crisis will
keep spiraling outside its borders.
Fighting has spilled over into
Turkey, Jordan and Israel since
the uprising began more than 20
months ago, but Lebanon is par-
ticularly susceptible.
Seventeen times bigger than
Lebanon and four times more
populous, Syria has long had
powerful allies there, including
the Iran-backed militant group
Hezbollah. For much of the past
30 years, Lebanese have lived
under Syrian military and politi-
cal domination.
That grip began to slip in
2005, when former Prime Min-
ister Rafik Hariri was assassi-
nated in Beirut. Widely accused
of involveisent -something it
has always denied - Syria was
forced to withdraw its troops. But
Damascus has maintained power
and influence in Lebanon.
Syria's state-run news agency,

SANA, reported that 17 Leba-
nese "gunmen" were killed inside
Syria last week, and on Sunday,
Syrian TV aired footage of the
dead.
Bassam al-Dada, a political
adviser for the rebel Free Syr-
ian Army, said the group believes
the Lebanese men were the vic-
tims of a "complicated Syrian
intelligence operation" aimed at
showing that foreign fighters are
involved in fighting in Syria.
According to their relatives,
Malek Haj Deeb and Bilal al-
Ghoul left their parents' homes a
week ago saying they were going
to downtown Tripoli. Hourslater,
the families grew concerned and
started calling the men's mobile
phones.
There was no sign of them
until two days later, when local
media reported that a group of
Lebanese citizens hadbeen killed
while fighting in Syria.
Pictures of the men, shown to
the AP by their families, showed
them clean-shaven and playing
in the snow in one of Lebanon's
mountain towns, and in front of
Tripoli's Crusader-built citadel.
"We want their bodies back,"
Omar al-Ghoul said.
On Wednesday, Syrian Ambas-
sador Ali Abdul-Karim Ali told
Lebanese Foreign Minister
Adnan Mansour that Damascus
has agreed to repatriate the men's
bodies. Lebanon's National News
Agency said the countries would
soon discuss how to hand them
over.
Members of the International
Committee of the Red Cross vis-
ited the dead men's families on
Tuesday and took details about
the men, their brothers said.
Jihad Haj Deeb said his broth-
er was about to resume his col-
lege studies and would not have
jeopardized his future to fight in
Syria.
"He registered at the universi-
ty four days before he went miss-
ing," Haj Deeb said, adding that
his brother took 500,000 pounds
($335) from their father to pay
his tuition at Lebanese Univer-
sity, where he was a third-year
mathematics student. Haj Deeb's
father, a school bus driver, makes
$400 a month and has nine other
children.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas speaks at a meeting of Palestinian leadership Saturday at his compound in the
West Bank city of Ramallah. Abbas has vowed to stop Israel from building new settlements in east Jerusalem.
srae Palestinians harden
stances on new settlement's

Abbas appeals to
U.N. to block new
push inWest Bank
JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestin-
ians and Israelis hardened their
positions Wednesday over a con-
tentious new settlement push
around Jerusalem, with Israel
going full throttle on plans to
develop the area and the Palestin-
ians trying to block it through an
appeal to the U.N. Security Coun-
cil.
The settlement push - Israel's
retaliation for the Palestinians'
success in winning U.N. recog-
nition of a de facto state - has
touched off an escalating inter-
national showdown. Palestinians
claim the construction would deal
a death blow to Mideast peace
hopes. Even Israel's staunchest
allies have been outraged by the
move, feeding speculation they
might squeeze Israel more than
usual to back down on its con-
struction plans.
The U.N. move came last week,
with the General Assembly recog-
nizing a Palestinian state in the
West Bank, east Jerusalem and
Gaza Strip - territories captured
by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
Israel, which rejects a return to
its 1967 lines, says borders with
a future Palestine should be
resolved through negotiations.

Michiqan's future is now

'M' earns road win

aris LeVert was des-
tined to redshirt, too
skinny and too raw to
see regular minutes as a fresh-
man. Michigan coach John
Beilein said he wasn't going to
use LeVert in a game this season
unless he absolutely needed to,
wanting to preserve the for-
ward's redshirt eligibility.
Freshman
Nik Stauskas
was also,
supposed to
come off the
bench this
season, too
one-dimen-
sional and
specialized EVERETT
to be in the COOK
starting line-
up. Beilein
said he needed to see more of
Stauskas to put him in the start-
ing lineup, and he wanted to give
consistent minutes to his lone
senior starter, Matt Vogrich.
So when Beilein stuck Staus-
kas in the starting lineup and
put LeVert into the game less
than five minutes into Saturday's
contest against Bradley, it was
more than just a simple lineup
decision.
It was a statement, a sign of
Beilein betting on this year's
squad. In a normal year, the
veteran coach would have stuck
with Vogrich for at least another
couple weeks, instead of just six
games. In a normal year, LeVert
would have stayed on the bench,
his potential minutes used by
Vogrich or senior Eso Akunne.
But in an abnormal year,
Beilein put every chip he had
available into play, making a
decision for the now rather than
for the later. He thinks that
Michigan can compete nation-
ally, that it can compete now.
It wasn't like a change needed
to be made for the Bradley game.
The Wolverines were sitting
pretty at 6-0, coming off a four-

Freshman guard Caris LeVert scored his first career points against WMU.

day stretch where they won the
NIT Season Tip-Off and beat
then-No. 18 North Carolina State
in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge.
The change wasn't made for
now, though. It was made for
March, when LeVert - already
one of the team's best perimeter
defenders - will be a valuable
defensive asset off the bench.
The move was made for later
on, but needed to be executed
now, because LeVert needs the
game experience in December to
be able to play in March. Beilein
is wary of burning Levert's red-
shirt if he isn't goingto get min-
utes, so combined with Stauskas
in the starting lineup, this
effectively bumps Vogrich and
Akunne out of the rotation.
, "You don't want a redshirt
playing two minutes a game,"
Beilein said after the game
against Bradley. "So you gotta
take minutes from somewhere
in order to give it to (LeVert), but
the young man's proved it and
(Vogrich and Akunne) are ready
if we need them."
The move to replace Vogrich

with Stauskas was due to the
play of both guards. In Beilein's
offense, Vogrich's role is to stand
in the corner and make 3-point-
ers - that's obviously a simpli-
fied version of it, but it's more or
less his job.
And Vogrich wasn't doing
that. He has shot 40 percent
from deep on the year, ont1O
attempts, and is averaging a little
more than two points a game.
That's fine, but it isn't great,
especially for someone whose
only job is to shoot from beyond
the arc.
Stauskas, on the other hand,
is shooting at a 64-percent clip
from deep, which is third best
in the country. The 6-foot-5
Canadian has also been more
than just a shooter, as his off-
the-dribble abilities have seem-
ingly improved in every game
this year.
To be fair, it only seemed like
a matter of time before Stauskas
would supplant Vogrich. Staus-
kas has an NBA-like shooting
stroke, while Vogrich's basket-
ball career will probably end in

Ann Arbor or a low-level Euro-
pean league.
But the fact that Beilein made
the switch now, in December,
shows that the coach didn't
think he could waste any time
getting Stauskas as much game
experience as possible before Big
Ten play started.
Case in point: over the last
two games, Stauskas has played
67 minutes. Vogrich has played
seven.
For the first time since the Fab
Five era in the early 1990s, there
are multiple Wolverines with
NBA-caliber talent, players who
could easily leave Ann Arbor
before their senior years. That's
exciting, but that's also why
Beilein isn't taking his time with
this team.
Preseason All-American Trey
Burke almost left for the NBA
after last season, and probably
will at the end of this one. Junior
Tim Hardaway Jr. could join
him. Freshman Glenn Robinson
III and McGary might not be far
behind. Even Stauskas might not
be at Michigan long enough to be
called a senior.
And yes, Michigan has tal-
ented recruits coming in, but
recruits are recruits. The highest
ranked player in this year's class
was McGary, who has so far
been the third-best freshman on
the team. Who knows how guys
are going to pan out.
And who knows who will stay,
and who will go.
Maybe next year everyone
will come back, and the rota-
tion will stay the same, just with
an added year of experience.
Maybe.
ButI don't think so, and
Beilein doesn't think so, and
that's why Stauskas is starting
and LeVert is on the court.
There is no playing for the
future anymore.

The last time the Michigan
women's basketball team trav-
eled to Normal, Ill. was Dec. 12,
1998. Then, Kim Barnes Arico was
coaching at the New Jersey Insti-
tute of Technology and the Wol-
verines outscored the Redbirds,
86-43.
Barnes Arico now leads Michi-
gan (7-2) as
the Wolver- MICHIGAN 56
ines' first- ILL. STATE 45
year coach
and Michigan topped Illinois
State, 56-45, in a back-and-forth
game.
After a slow start, cqnsisting
of five turnovers in the first 2:53,
Michigan was forced to adjust
from its usual reliance on its
starters. As a result, the Wolver-
ines substituted senior forward
Sam Arnold and freshman guard
Madison Ristovski for seniors Nya
Jordan and Kate Thompson - two
players that have carried Michi-
gan in its two most recent games.
For a team that typically relies
on just five starters for the major-
ity of scoring, and minutes, Michi-
gan needed the help of some bench
players to right the ship.
After nearly six minutes of rest,
the Wolverines' leading scorer,
Thompson, returned to the court
and promptly made a 3-pointer to
give Michigan its first lead of the
game midwaythrough the half.
By scoring 14 straight points to
make the score 19-9, it appeared
that the Wolverines' signature
dribble-drive style of play, and
kick-out 3-pointers were going to
be able to put the game away early,
but Illinois State fought back.
In the final 9:36 of the first
half, the Redbirds (4-3) outscored
Michigan 12-4, as the Wolver-
ines turned the ball over again
and again. To be fair, Michigan
was not alone, as each team only
scored one basket each in the final
5:19 of the first stanza.

The Wolverines' scoring lapses
continued after the break, when
the Redbirds opened with the
first five points of the half to take
their first lead since 6:58 into the
contest. But just as she did in the
first half, Thompson again hit a
3-pointer to wake the Wolverines
up and give them a one-point lead.
From that point on, Michigan
repeated the same pattern that led
to its first-half success - 3-point-
ers and easy layups.
Led by Thompson's 12 second-
half points, and 18 total points, the
Wolverines were able to do what
they didn't do well in the first half
- protect their lead comfortably,
rather than gradually let it slip
down to a narrow margin.
After a layup by senior guard
Jenny Ryan - who finished with
12 points and seven rebounds -
with 2:07 left pushed the lead to
nine, it was up to Michigan to
make its free throws and secure
the victory. And that's just what
the Wolverines did - making four
of six from the charity stripe to
close the game out.
What ultimately doomed Illi-
nois State was its lack of offensive
production from its big-three of
Jamie Russell, Janae Smith and
Candace Sykes, who coming in had
averaged slightly over 52 points
per games. The trio was limited by
Michigan's tight defense and man-
aged only 16 total points, while
being out-rebounded 42-24.
"I thought (our defense) was
outstanding," Barnes Arico said.
"We were really going after it. I
was really proud of it."
Two players in particular
that were key for the Wolverines
rebounding and defense were
Arnold and sophomore Nicole
Elmblad, who combined for 15
rebounds, including a team-high
of 10 by Elmblad. Arnold also
added seven points, well above her
average of two for the season after
playing 18 minutes for the foul-
troubled Sheffer, who still tallied
10 points and seven rebounds.

Trouba on loan for WJC

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
On Tuesday, USA Hockey
announced that Michigan fresh-
man defenseman Jacob Trouba
was named to the the United
States' World Junior team's pre-
liminary roster.
"It's always an interesting
experience for those kids," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"It'll be a good measuring stick for
(Trouba). He's already in a good
place right now, (but) he'll come
back and should give us a lift."
This wouldn't be the first
time Trouba has represented the
United States at an international
level - he won a gold medal at the
Under-18 World Junior Champi-
onship earlier this year.
If Trouba makes the final team
final roster, which is announced
on Dec. 23, he will miss the Great
Lakes Invitational to play in the
World Junior Championship, held
this year in Ufa, Russia from Dec.
26-Jan 5.
Trouba's absence at the GLI
would be a significant blow to
Michigan's defensive corps, which
has alreadybeen severely depleted
with injuries and has struggled
throughout the season.
Junior Jon Merrill, who was
expected to be the Wolverines' top
defenseman, hasn't seen action
since cracking his seventh verte-
brae in an exhbition game against
Windsor on Oct. 9. Though Mer-
rill is no longer wearing a neck
brace, Berenson still expects it
to be months before he is healthy
enough to skate again.
Junior defenseman Kevin Clare
also sustained an undisclosed
injury within the past month,
though he still played in last Fri-
day's game against Ferris State.
Berenson scratched Clare on Sat-
urday.
Berenson said his top prior-
ity is now keeping players healthy
enough to compensate for Trou-
ba's inevitable absence from the
GLI - there is little doubt in his
mind that Trouba will make the
roster.
"If (Trouba) doesn't make the
final cut, I want to see the guys
that do," Berenson joked.

Freshman defenseman Jacob Trouba was named to the Team USA preliminary
roster and will audition to play in the World Junior Championships.

What will you do?
Anything you want.
You've written your own game
plan so far in life. Why not take
it one step further and become
a Rhodes, Marshall, or Mitchell
Scholar?

Though Michigan's goaltending
has been lackluster at best thus far
this the season, Berenson hasn't
pointed fingers at freshmen goal-
ies Steve Racine and Jared Rut-
ledge for Michigan's 5-8-2 record.
Though Berenson never
expected an easy transition for the
pair, he didn't anticipate Michigan
to be No. 1Sin the CCHA for goals
allowed per game, with 3.5.
"You're never going to be a win-
ning team without good goaltend-
ing andI think we're not far off the
mark," Berenson said. "We've got
to get our goals-against down and
our save percenaget up, no matter
who's playing."
Rutledge started on Friday,
though after allowing five goals, it
wasn't a difficult decision to put in
Racine the next night.
Though he gave up a goal in
the first 42 seconds of the game,
Racine quickly recovered and
looked more comfortable in the
crease as the night went on. With
the game tied in the third period,
Ferris State swarmed Michigan's
zone to look for the game winner.
Berenson estimated that the
Bulldogs had about five qual-
ity looks at net during that time,
including one on a breakaway,

and he was impressed that
Racine "made some great saves."
Though he looked good in the
game's waning minutes, Racine
didn't look as impressive ear-
lier in the contest when he let
in three goals that Berenson
dubbed soft. The Wolverines will
never put full responsibility for
losses on the goalies, they still
need them to step up more when
they can.
"We need (the goalies) to be
able to make the save they're able
to make," Berenson said. "We're
victimized by our goalies giving
up a bad goal at a bad time. It just
kills you."
BYE, BYE, BYE: Michigan has
its first of two.byes this weekend
before facing Western Michigan
next Friday.
The most welcome aspect of
the bye week isn't that it gives
the Wolverines extra practice
before its next series - it's that it
gives them extra time for school
work.
"It's nice to have a bye week
any time of year," said junior
defenseman Mac Bennett.
"Especially now with exams,
our guys will get some rest that's
been well deserved."

Falsetto is essentially a form
of cheating. For those who don't
know, falsetto is the voice a
singer employs to reach notes
that extend upwards beyond his
or her natural vocal range. It
can be quite lovely if done well
and rather torturous if not (Say,
when I'm singing along loudly
to '90s Mariah). I believe. pop
music is experiencing a golden
age of male falsetto.
The conversation must start
with "Climax" by Usher. Quite
possibly the jam of summer
2012, "Climax" is perhaps the
finest falsetto performance since
Michael in his prime. When
Usher finally comes down to
earth to crush us in the bridge,
the contrast makes his in-regis-
ter voice seem that much more
buttery smooth. This one is the
blueprint.
Yet many of the finer falsetto
offerings, no surprise, lie in the
indie realm. Bon Iver's Justin
Vernon came out of his father's
cabin with "Skinny Love" in tow,
breaking hearts cloaked in plaid
ever since.
And the hearts that stayed
intact were surely ripped apart
by Frank Ocean's "Thinking

Then, of course, there's Justin

If there's one thingyou need rightnow, it's a pick-

So what if it's a rom-coin. So what if it's just

love in the month leading up 'til Christmas, and

In order to question and challenge gender roles, director Malcolm Tulip cast many of the actors in cross-gender roles.

Tulip emphasized scouring
the text for details such as these.
Myers underwent a similar
last-minute adjustment in her
costume design.
Close to her design presen-
tation, she thought Hermia's
costume was incorrect. "I com-
pletely redesigned one of the
characters last-minute based on
balance and on the cast."
For Tulip and Myers, such
moments do more than enrich a
production - they're inherent to
the rehearsal process.
"I see it as a scientific process
in that you have a hypothesis,"
Tulip said. "You have an idea
about what you think (a play)
should be. You devise an experi-
ment. You run a rehearsal. You
observe the results. You come
to a conclusion, and you get new
information constantly chang-
ing that conclusion."
Myers described her costume
design asa gifting process.
"There's always a shift and I
actually love that moment where
I feel like I'm passing a baton,"
Myers said. "It's been my design,
and it becomes (the actor's), and
then it's not mine anymore."
Collins, meanwhile, likens the

play to straw punch candy.
"Originally it has that bite." he
said. "It has that flavor in your
mouth that you don't know what
to do with, but after you suck
on it for a while, you let it really
embody you."
"It's a good taste, it's a good
