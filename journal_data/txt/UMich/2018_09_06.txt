The 
Washtenaw 
County 

Board 
of 
Commissioners 

unanimously voted to adopt 
the Washtenaw County Equity 
Policy at its board meeting 
Wednesday night, establishing 
a Racial Equity Office to address 
issues of inequity in the county 
and calling for all aspects of 
the 
county 
government 
to 

implement strategies that will 
result in “equitable outcomes 
for all residents.”

Washtenaw 

County ranked 81 out of 83 
Michigan counties in economic 
inequality, according to this 
year’s County Health ratings. 
Median 
income 
for 
Black 

households 
is 
nearly 
half 

the median income of white 
households 
according 
to 
a 

2015 
reportby 
Opportunity 

Washtenaw. The same report 
shows that if there had been no 
racial gaps in income in 2014, 
the local GDP would have been 
$1.79 billion higher.

Felicia Brabec, D-District 

4, chair of ways and means, 

thanked the county residents 
“who 
are 
holding 
us 

accountable to do better … in 
our community.”

“I know it’s only a first step, 

but it’s been a really long, 
long time coming,” Brabec 

said. “We get to focus on the 
implementation now.”

Conan 
Smith, 
D-District 

9, emphasized the need to 
properly implement the policy.

“Someone said from the 

audience earlier this evening 

that we should not be so 
much debating the passage of 
this but debating how it gets 
implemented 
best,” 
Smith 

said, calling racial inequity 
an “emerging problem that 

While 
construction 
work 

seems to appear everywhere 
on the University of Michigan’s 
Central Campus this fall, a 
shiny new addition on North 
University 
provides 
relief 

from the constant demolition 
and renovation: the Biological 
Sciences Building.

The building’s interior is 

open, with natural light pouring 
in through the large windows 
facing onto the transportation 
center. It contains state-of-the-
art classrooms, laboratories and 
faculty offices. The different 
departments 
are 
in 
close 

proximity with each other and 
in some cases share labs in order 
to encourage collaboration and 
interdisciplinary research.

ADMINISTRATION

University 
of 
Michigan 

Regent Ron Weiser, R, and his 
wife Eileen Weiser donated $10 
million Wednesday to establish 
the Weiser Diplomacy Center 
at the Ford School of Public 
Policy. Weiser, chair of the 
state Republican party, began 
working on the idea of the 
center with Public Policy Dean 
Michael Barr last spring with 
the goal of generating interest 
in diplomacy among students 
and 
providing 
them 
with 

career services in the field.

“Diplomacy is so important 

in the way that we deal with 
the rest of the world that I 
felt giving (students) a chance 
to be exposed to diplomats 
and secretaries of state and 
others who are part of that 
process would give (students) 
a path they want to follow 
and also give them a lot more 
knowledge if they chose to 
follow 
that 
career 
path,” 

Weiser said. 

Aside 
from 
providing 

workshops, conferences and 
internship opportunities, the 
center is expected to bring 
ambassadors 
and 
foreign 

policy experts to the Public 
Policy School. Weiser, founder 
and CEO of national real 
estate investment company 
McKinley Associates, Inc. and 
former U.S. ambassador to 
Slovakia, said he has personal 
connections with diplomats 
whom he would like to help 
bring to the University.

“A former Secretary of State 

would be nice to bring, and 
certainly there’s a number of 
ambassadors that I know – 
former ambassador of NATO, 
a number of people within the 
National Security Council – so 
people of that caliber that I 
want to help bring,” he said.

The 
contribution, 
along 

with previous donations to 
found the Weiser Center for 
Emerging 
Democracies 
in 

the International Institute in 
2014 and the Weiser Center

‘U’ sexual misconduct report shows 
claim increase, fewer investigations

OIE received 277 cases of student misconduct, up from 218 reports last year 

In 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 

#MeToo movement and along 
with an increase in survivors 
stepping forward to publicly 
speak out against instances of 
sexual assault, the University 
of Michigan has seen a similar 
increase in reports of sexual 
misconduct compared to last 
year. The recent publication of the 
Office for Institutional Equity’s 
yearly 
Sexual 
Misconduct 

Report presents a rise of reported 
sexual 
misconduct 
instances 

coupled with a decrease in 
University investigations.

The publication aggregated all 

reports received by OIE between 
July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 and 
the office’s responses within the 
University’s Student Sexual and 
Gender-Based Misconduct Policy. 
Compared to last year’s report, 
OIE saw a 27 percent increase of 
reported cases, rising from 218 to 
277. 

Within the same time period, 

the number of investigations 
launched 
from 
reports 
to 

OIE 
decreased 
from 
28 
to 

20. 
The 
number 
of 
reports 

have 
steadily 
risen 
since 

University 
president 
Mark 

Schlissel commissioned campus 
climate 
surveys 
on 
sexual 

misconduct in 2015. The findings 
reported 11 percent of students 
experienced sexual assault during 
their time on campus. 

University 
Title 
IX 

Coordinator 
Pamela 
Heatlie 

said the increase in reported 

cases may be indicative of the 
effectiveness of the University’s 
recent reporting channel updates. 
As for the investigation data, 
Heatlie said it’s difficult to draw 
any conclusions.

“Reports being up, I think, 

is a positive indicator that our 
education 
efforts 
about 
our 

process of reporting and people’s 
willingness to report to us is 
effective. It’s going up year over 
year which is good,” Heatlie 
said. “In terms of the number of

Thanks to a $4.3 million 

grant and the tenacity of a few 
professors, students and future 
students with physical disabilities 
might be able to live a little more 
comfortably.

In October, a new research 

center at the University of 
Michigan will begin investigating 
how to improve aging for those 
facing 
long-term 
physical 

disabilities.

The idea for the new research 

center was spearheaded by a team 
of investigators: Michelle Meade, 
an associate professor of physical 
medicine 
and 
rehabilitation 

psychology; 
Philippa 
Clarke, 

a professor of epidemiology; 
and 
Robyn 
Rontal, 
policy 

analytics director at the Center 
for Healthcare Research and 
Transformation.

Clarke said a new research 

center is necessary to help 
design a world more accessible 
to individuals with physical 
disabilities.

“What’s happened essentially 

is that people who have had 
disabilities in the past, typically 
never lived long enough to be 
old or to age,” Clarke said. “But 
with all the improvements in 
technology and medical care, 
there is a wonderful thing 
that is happening: People with 
disabilities are now growing 
older. However the services and 
support that we have set up for 
older adults have never really 
been targeted or able to meet 
the needs of this new group of 
clients who have been living with 
physical disabilities.”

Meade, the lead investigator 

for the research center, believes 
the center could perhaps ease 
those complexities.

“Individuals with disabilities 

are more likely to have other 
health 
conditions, 
such 
as 

diabetes, 
depression,” 
Maede 

said. “They are more likely have 
had days where they are not 
feeling well, and less likely to 
have access to care, and more 
likely to report problems with 
the care they have. So we put all 
these pieces together, working 
among these departments really 
provides us with the opportunity 
to develop a solution that could be 
used here and across the United 
States.”

According 
to 
a 
National 

Center for Education Statistics 
report, students with physical 
disabilities in 2011 and 2012 
accounted for 11.1 percent of 
all 
undergraduates 
enrolled 

nationwide. The 2016 Campus 
Climate Survey says 5 percent of 
students at the University report 
having a disability. 

The 
University 

offers resources for students with 
physical 
disabilities. 
Students 

who are deaf, hard of hearing or 
have temporary or permanent 
motoric disabilities are eligible 
to receive accomodations in 
their classes. These can include 
notetaking, video captioning and 
real-time transcription services. 
However, these resources are 
often difficult to access or even 
inadequate. Last year, then-
Architechture graduate student 
Mieko Preston told The Daily that 
it was an uphill battle to register 
for disability accomodations with 
the University. She experienced a 

stroke several years ago and now 
uses a medical scooter.

“The accessibility of being 

able 
to 
benefit 
from 
those 

accommodations or resources 
that are necessarily put in place 
is actually extremely difficult,” 
she said. 

Meade and her colleagues 

requested 
funding 
from 

the 
National 
Institute 
on 

Disability, Independent Living 
and 
Rehabilitation 
Research 

to establish a Rehabilitation 
Research and Training Center 
program at the University. The 
center will conduct research, offer 
hands-on training and spreads 
awareness 
and 
information 

around rehabilitation efforts. 

These 
University 
studies, 

called 
the 
the 
Investigating 

Disability Factors and Promoting 
Environmental 
Access 
for 

Healthy Living RRTC, or IDEAL, 
will look specifically at the 
effects that both personal and 
environmental factors have on 
people with physical disabilities 
and how that, in turn, affects the 
aging process.

Meade also hopes this center 

will serve as a national resource 
center for policy makers, and all 
types of disability organizations, 
thus helping distribute the new 
knowledge breed at the U-M 
research center.

“One of the projects run by Dr. 

Michael McKee is about creating 
a model clinic for family medicine 
for individuals with disabilities,” 
Meade said. “Once again, we 
want to develop the best practice 
and then we want to share them. 
Hopefully, by doing this, we will 
be changing the way that we do 
clinical practice, they way that we 

provide services, and make sure 
things are relevant for people 
with physical disabilities.”

Meade said this center will help 

people nationally and hopefully 
make its way onto campus.

“Students are in the need 

of also accessing care, such as 
getting into the recreational 
facilities or accessing courses and 
lectures with those with hearing 
impairments,” Clarke said. “We 
are trying to understand how 
we structure our campus with 
simple things like examining how 
many stairs we have.”

Engineering sophomore Ellie 

Rocheleau said she believes the 
research center will provide 
new opportunities and a sense of 
optimism for those dealing with 
long-term physical disabilities.

“Someone I know is affected 

by ulcerated colitis, which is the 
swelling of the colon that leads 
to stomach aches and other 
intestinal 
issues,” 
Rocheleau 

said. “This is usually linked with 
severe arthritis, which in turn, 
leads to being unable to drive, 
walk, or even stand. Not only does 
this also affect him physically; it 
has led to a great deal of anxiety 
to try to figure out how to live his 
day to day— because even when 
he has good days, it is still an 
ongoing battle. It is hard enough 
to be able to deal with the one 
initial illness; if there was some 
new technology or medicine that 
could make living just a little 
easier, I think that would make 
all the difference.”

the School of Education in 
2008, is another in a series of 
efforts by the Weisers to align 
the 
University 
community 

with Weiser’s previous work in 
Europe. 

LSA junior David Carpenter, 

vice president of policy for the 
student-run Michigan Foreign 
Policy Council, said he believes 
the center will provide students 

who are interested in entering 
the field of diplomacy with the 
tools and information they need 
to launch their careers.

“In terms of career aspects for 

a lot of students there, I know I 
want to enter foreign service or 
something diplomacy related 
so I think having (the center) 
for students is definitely good 
for having career opportunities 
and really good mentorship 
opportunities,” Carpenter said.

In a press release Wednesday, 

John Ciorciari, director of the 

International 
Policy 
Center 

at the Public Policy School, 
reaffirmed the belief that the 
center will help prepare students 
for careers in diplomacy.

“This 
new 
initiative 
will 

help train a new generation 
of informed, principled, and 
entrepreneurial 
students 

committed 
to 
international 

affairs,” Ciorciari wrote. “ will 
also help connect the academy 
to the world of foreign policy 
practice 
to 
generate 
new 

ideas for addressing the many 

global challenges we face. No 
comparable 
concentration 
of 

diplomatic expertise exists at 
any university in the Midwest.”

Carpenter agreed the center 

will 
introduce 
students 
to 

careers in international affairs 
who otherwise wouldn’t have 
seriously considered such a 
career as an option living in the 
Midwest.

“I definitely think having 

people 
come 
to 
the 
Ford 

School that are in that field 
will 
definitely 
open 
doors 

for 
students 
who 
never 

really considered (careers in 
diplomacy) 
as 
a 
possibility, 

especially since I feel like often 
times the foreign policy world 
is so centered in Washington 
that people might not be able 
to make it a conscious effort … 
to reach out to universities like 
us,” Carpenter said.

The $10 million donation 

is the latest addition to the 
Weisers’ contributions to the 
University. Both Ron and Eileen 
Weiser are University alumni, 

and their biggest contribution 
came in 2014 with a $50 million 
donation. Half of the donation 
was 
distributed 
across 
the 

School of Education, University 
Athletic Department, University 
Health 
System, 
University 

Musical Society and Ross School 
of Business, with the remaining 
half dedicated to the Center for 
Emerging Democracies.

When asked about plans for 

future donations, Weiser said 
he has “some other ideas and 
thoughts” in his head.

highly 
contrasting 

campaigns in hopes of following 
Snyder, who is leaving the 
seat with low approval ratings 
following the Flint water crisis, 
as Michigan governor. 

Now, with nine weeks left 

until 
the 
general 
election, 

Whitmer is polling 9 points 
ahead of Schuette, according to 
RealClearPolitics.

The 
Libertarian 
Party, 

qualifying as a major party in 
Michigan, also held its first 
primary in the state Aug. 7. 
Insurance title examiner Bill 
Gelineau and former Livonia 
teacher John Tatar faced off, 
with 
Gelineau 
winning 
58 

percent of the vote.

The election results diverged 

from student polling conducted 
by The Daily — last fall, 
University of Michigan alum 
Abdul El-Sayed, the former 
Detroit 
Health 
Department 

Director, received the highest 
share 
of 
potential 
student 

voters. 32 percent of students 
indicated they planned to vote 
for El-Sayed in the primaries.

The 
Michigan 
primary 

election featured voter turnout 
that broke records going as far 
back as 1978. Nearly 29 percent of 
registered voters casted ballots, 
amounting in about 2.5 million 
votes total. Washtenaw County 
experienced the largest surge 
in voter turnout in the state, 
increasing from 21.6 percent in 
2010 to 34.4 percent. 

Vote Breakdown
Republican 
candidates 

on 
the 
ballot 
included 

Schuette, 
Lieutenant 
Gov. 

Brian Calley, state Sen. Patrick 
Colbeck and Dr. Jim Hines. 
Schuette won 50 percent of 
vote, and Calley was the runner 
up at 25.2 percent. Colbeck 
followed at 13.1 percent and 
Hines at 11 percent.

Schuette led in the primary 

polls and was expected to 
win 
the 
nomination. 
An 

endorsement from President 
Donald 
Trump 
played 
a 

significant role in his campaign. 
In June, Vice President Mike 
Pence 
visited 
Michigan 
to 

campaign on Schuette’s behalf.

“President 
Trump 
has 

endorsed my candidacy for 
governor because he knows 
I’ll cut taxes in Michigan like 
he’s cut taxes in America,” 
Schuette said in the final GOP 
debate in July. “It’s time that 
Michigan wins again.”

Schuette 
also 
received 

endorsements from several U.S. 
Republican 
representatives 

and the Michigan Chamber of 

Commerce. Meanwhile, Calley 
was endorsed by Gov. Rick 
Snyder and Colbeck by Texas 
Sen. Ted Cruz. 

Democratic candidates on 

the ballot included Whitmer, 
El-Sayed and businessman Shri 
Thanedar. Whitmer won with 
52 percent of the vote, followed 
by El-Sayed with 30.2 percent 
and Thanedar with 17.7 percent.

El-Sayed 
received 

endorsements 
from 
several 

progressives 
during 
his 

campaign, including Vermont 
Sen. Bernie Sanders as well 
as activist Shaun King and new

Whitmer has emphasized 

her substantial experience in

we’re 
hiring 
someone 

to run our state, to oversee 
our schools and our higher 
education institutions as well 
as our criminal justice system,

I think that we need someone 
who knows what they’re doing,” 
Whitmer said in an interview 
with The Daily in July.

GROW TH AND GRIT

Joe Salvatore, director of the Science Learning Center, discusses the power of a growth mindset in the Undergraduate Science Building 
Wednesday evening. 

CARTER FOX/Daily

NOVEMBER
From Page 1

The 
building 
project 

was approved by the University 
Board of Regents in 2014 to give the 
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 
Department 
and 
Molecular, 

Cellular 
and 
Developmental 

Biology 
Department 
a 
better 

working space, as the 103-year-
old 
Kraus 
Natural 
Science 

Building was deteriorating. In 
2017, the Museum of Natural 
History announced plans to join 
the EEB and MCDB departments 
in the new building. The BSB 
now also houses the paleontology 
museum faculty and staff. The 
Ruthven building, which formerly 

housed the museum, will be the 
new headquarters for University 
administration 
when 
Fleming 

Building is demolished. 

For post-doctoral student Torey 

Arnold, the building change is 
welcome. Arnold is a cell biologist 
who researches the changing 
cells and tissues of frogs in 
metamorphosis. He appreciated 
the 
building’s 
aesthetics 
and 

convenience.

“It’s made everything more 

efficient, putting everything closer 
together,” Arnold said. “It’s also 
gotten me a better view (from my 
window).”

Engineering junior Weihong 

Chou said he spends time before 
his biology class in the BSB, 
expressing his admiration of the 

building’s design. 

“I really love the glass,” Chou 

said. “I like how clean everything 
looks.”

But the building shift was not 

an enthusiastic transition for 
everyone. Catherine Badgley, an 
EEB professor and researcher 
in the Museum of Paleontology, 
used to teach at the North 
University Building and misses the 
way both NUB and the museum 
allowed her to interact with her 
department.

“I’m not yet convinced that 

the change is positive,” Badgley 
said. “I really enjoyed the way I 
interacted particularly with my 
students in the museum building, 
where I could every day go into a 
lab area, we could meet around a 

big table, discuss informally, we 
could have regular lab meetings, 
we could have lunches, things 
like that. And that’s not possible 
in this building, at least not yet, 
without scheduling a room that 
is sometimes already booked for 
other people’s meetings.”

Badgley said she’s still waiting to 

see how everything turns out and if 
the previous department synergy 
will return. She acknowledged, 
though, while certain things have 
been lost, the building has created 
many 
new 
opportunities 
for 

workspace and research. 

Students and faculty agreed 

the arrival of the BSB will require 
some adjustment. But at least on its 
sleek surface, it’s hard to deny the 
BSB is, as Arnold put it, “cool.” 

that we had to grapple with more 

constructively, more intentionally.”

The bill calls for racial equity 

training for all commissioners 
and members of county boards, 
commissions 
and 
committees. 

Departments will be required to 
create a racial equity plan, but 
plans for evaluation and metrics 
have yet to be determined. 

Smith said he believes the policy 

would help confront the challenge 
of inequity in the county.

“By 
adopting 
this 
office 

this evening by identifying a 
staffing structure and a regular 
commitment to including this in a 
four-year budget, so that it is not a 
flash in the pan — that is going to 
lay a foundation that I believe we 
have badly needed for a long time,” 
Smith said. “Whoever ends up in 
this office certainly has their work 
cut out for them.”

The Racial Equity Office will 

lead the effort to tackle inequity, 
reporting 
directly 
to 
County 

Administrator 
Gregory 
Dill. 

During the public hearing prior to 
the board’s vote, Trevor Bechtel, 

a pastor at Shalom Community 
Church in Ann Arbor, said the 
Racial 
Equity 
Office 
would 

institutionalize the work to reduce 
gaps in resources.

“An office allows the people 

working 
on 
this 
policy 
to 
 

address 
questions 
of 
racial 

equity from inside the system, 
so 
it 
becomes 
a 
systematic 

conversation,” 
Bechtel 
said. 

“Part of addressing a systematic 
question like racism is positioning 
the structure and creating the 
institution that can have that 
conversation.”

Margy 
Long, 
director 

of Washtenaw Success by 6, which 
works to combat the opportunity 
gap faced by children of color and 
low-income children in elementary 
school, spoke up during a public 
comment 
period, 
encouraging 

the commissioners to reach out 
to 
community 
members 
who 

are affected by racism and social 
injustice as they begin enacting the 
equity policy. 

“If we hope to make an impact 

with this policy and this office, I 
hope that it goes much beyond just 
talking to professionals, and you 
really reach out to the people in the 
community,” Long said.

investigations this year dipping, 
we had another year where it 
dipped. It’s kind of hard to have 
any feelings about a one-year 
data point.”

Rackham 
student 
Nicole 

Bedera is currently conducting 
a dissertation at the University 
on 
how 
various 
academic 

institutions respond to sexual 
misconduct 
cases. 
When 

considering the current OIE 
report, Bedera said the low 
number 
of 
investigations 

compared to the previous year 
could be a result of the increased 
attention to reporting processes 
on behalf of the University. 
She said data collection on the 
claimants’ 
impressions 
after 

interacting with OIE would be 
helpful in determining whether 
or 
not 
the 
new 
reporting 

methodology 
benefits 
the 

claimants.

“It is possible that more 

stringent mandatory reporting 
requirements 
are 
bringing 

more reluctant complainants 
forward 
who 
were 
never 

interested in an investigation 
and 
would 
not 
participate 

should one start,” Bedera wrote 
in an email. “I would like to see 
more information reflecting the 
degree to which those reporting 
sexual misconduct are satisfied 
with their treatment by the 
Office for Institutional Equity.”

The 
report 
breaks 
down 

the total 277 cases into eight 
categories – 148 sexual assault 
concerns, 85 sexual harassment 
claims, 26 stalking claims, 27 
intimate partner violence cases, 
four gender-based harassment 
claims, 
three 
retaliation 

concerns, 
one 
violation 
of 

interim measures and seven 
“other” cases. “Other” cases 
involved prohibited conduct that 
did not explicitly fall under the 
University’s sexual misconduct 
policy. 

When considering the cause 

of why the number of launched 
investigations dipped compared 
to last year, Heatlie pointed 
to data in the report on the 
University’s policy scope and 

the wishes of the claimant. 
The report claims 102 of the 
277 reports brought to the 
University were deemed outside 
of the University policy’s scope, 
meaning 
the 
report 
could 

possibly 
involve 
a 
member 

outside 
of 
the 
University 

community, conduct that isn’t 
technically prohibited by the 
policy, etc.

Out of the 175 cases that 

were deemed inside the scope 
of University policy, 152 of the 
cases were not pursued because 
either the claimant did not 
want an investigation or OIE 
could not identify the claimant. 
Heatlie cites this as the primary 
reason for why there are so many 
reports and so few investigations 
launched. Heatlie said OIE takes 
the claimant’s wishes heavily 
into account when considering 
investigating.

“We would be happy to 

investigate every single report 
that comes into our office but 
our Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy … has a process that gives 
the claimant the ability to say 
to the institution, ‘I would like 

this investigated’ or ‘I wouldn’t 
like this investigated,’” Heatlie 
said. “We want to respect that 
when possible, when there isn’t, 
for example, a campus safety 
issue that overrides that request 
and so our primary focus when 
handling any report that comes 
into our office is campus safety 
and wellbeing, including the 
well-being of that particular 
claimant.”

Melissa Overton, deputy chief 

of police at the University’s 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security, also spoke about the 
reasons why someone might 
not report a sexual misconduct 
case. According to both Overton 
and Heatlie, DPSS and OIE 
work together on cases when a 
crime has been committed such 
as sexual assault or intimate 
partner violence.

While 
Overton 
said 
she 

expected sexual assault claims 
to increase due to situations 
like the Nassar trial giving

McCain showed why compromise matters
O

n 
Aug. 
25, 
Arizona 
Sen. 
John 
McCain 
passed away due to 
complications from brain cancer. 
After McCain was diagnosed 
with glioblastoma last July, his 
health 
steadily 
deteriorated 
until he made the decision to 
discontinue his treatment a few 
days before his death.
The late senator was a naval 
hero, having spent multiple years 
as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. 
He retired from the Navy in 1981 
and entered politics, blazing his 
own legacy as both a champion 
of conservatism and an ardent 
believer in compromise. See, 
McCain was a self-described 
maverick: a politician willing 
to cross political party lines 
to 
protect 
his 
values. 
He 
represented a brand of politician 
that is largely absent from the 
American political scene today.
I was shocked to see much 
of the response to the senator’s 
passing was critical. Instead of 
celebrating McCain’s legacy, the 
media largely used his death to 
attack President Donald Trump 
and even express dissatisfaction 
over McCain’s ideology. In fact, 
The New Yorker released an 
article that focused on Trump’s 
petty 
response 
to 
McCain’s 
death, calling Trump a “liar” 
and “crook” instead of focusing 
on McCain’s sizable legacy.
Why 
couldn’t 
people 
put their ideologies aside to 
celebrate McCain’s great career 
and sacrifices for the country?
In 
America’s 
current 
politically polarized state, it has 
become increasingly important 
to bring people from both sides 
together. 
While 
reflecting 
on McCain and his work in 
the Senate, it’s imperative to 
highlight and remember his 
efforts to put politics above 
party lines.
The 
U.S. 
government 
is 
extremely inefficient. It’s how 
it was constructed. Efficiency 
was compromised in favor of 
checks and balances. With a 
Congress that can switch parties 

every two years and a president 
that can switch every four, it 
is very difficult to produce 
lasting 
legislation 
without 
bipartisan support. Otherwise, 
legislation would just be rolled 
back every time the party in 
control switches.
Trump’s 
rise 
to 
the 
presidency 
has 
seemingly 
damaged the social fabric of 
the U.S., widening the rift 
between 
conservatives 
and 
liberals, 
thereby 
making 
it 
difficult 
to 
have 
discussion 
across party lines. Though much 
of Trump’s policy aligns with 
the moderate right, his rhetoric 
and alternative facts have been 

used to brand conservatives 
as a racist, uneducated and 
misogynistic group. 
But it’s not just the right 
that is hurt by this. On the other 
side, the rise of Democratic 
socialists has contributed to the 
polarization. Political leaders 
like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 
and New York congressional 
candidate Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez have developed the left as 
socialist and at times intolerant.
This 
marque 
of 
radicalism has become quite 
counterproductive to achieving 
true political progress in the 
United States. The number of 
violent groups on either side 
has been increasing recently, 
and as a result has created a 
nasty facade to politics. People 
actively 
avoid 
showcasing 
their party allegiance publicly 
and stay away from politics 
entirely for fear of being 
judged and attacked. In fact, 

when I was canvassing for a 
local candidate this summer 
many individuals refused to 
put up yard signs or even talk 
to me for that reason alone.
Even 
worse 
than 
this 
is 
the 
rise 
of 
intolerance 
for 
even 
hearing 
out 
opposing 
arguments. 
Many 
top 
conservative 
thought 
leaders and polemicists have 
been actively shut out by 
students 
and 
even 
college 
administrators 
from 
even 
being able to simply share their 
ideas on campus. The University 
of California, Berkeley riots 
in opposition to people like 
conservative writer Ben Shapiro 
were one of the many examples 
of active infringements on free 
speech rights. 
At 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, where a substantial 
number 
of 
students 
are 
Democrats, it is important to 
make sure the other side is 
heard out and respected. We 
must branch out of our own 
echo chambers and try to at 
the very least acknowledge the 
validity of the other side.
The other day I had a 
conversation with a couple of 
friends who were of opposite 
political ideologies. As politics 
go, the discussion got heated at 
times, but in the end we were 
able to compromise on certain 
issues. 
Political 
discourse 
needs to be open and factual 
discourse. No ad hominem. No 
racism or sexism. Just free and 
proper debate.
So 
instead 
of 
creating 
conspiracy out of McCain’s 
passing or blaming the current 
presidential 
administration, 
respect the senator’s legacy 
by making an extra effort to 
hear out both political sides. 
Practice politics in the spirit of 
the maverick. And who knows? 
Maybe it’ll change your mind. 
It sure did change mine.

Deplatforming political celebrities

HANK MINOR | COLUMN

M

ilo Yiannopoulos, the 
“alt-right” firebrand 
and 
provocateur, 
fell from grace far earlier 
than many of the political 
entertainers raised high by 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
election. He was permanently 
banned from Twitter in 2016, 
resigned from Breitbart as a 
senior editor in 2017 and lost his 
spot at the Politicon convention 
in 2018. His college speaking 
engagements, 
once 
a 
major 
engine for his career, have 
largely dried up. Now, in front of 
his much-diminished audience, 
he’s melting down.
“I have been betrayed and 
abandoned by everyone who 
ever 
called 
themselves 
my 
friend, with a small handful of 
notable exceptions … I almost 
single handedly ignited the 
current 
debate 
about 
free 
speech on campus and NO ONE 
has ever matched my ability to 
draw attention to these issues … I 
have lost everything standing up 
for the truth in America, spent 
all my savings, destroyed all my 
friendships and ruined my whole 
life,” Yiannopoulos wrote in a 
(lengthy) Facebook post.
I’ve never been entirely 
convinced that protest with 
the goal of “de-platforming” 
ideologues is very effective. 
Organization 
against 
highly 
public 
stunts, 
like 
college 
speaking 
tours, 
seem 
to 
primarily 
serve 
as 
fodder 
for the Fox News outrage 
machine. 
“De-platforming” 
has to have support from a 
higher level — news companies, 
tech companies and financial 
interests — to truly work. That 
said, Yiannopoulos’ accelerating 
public decline has made me 
reconsider, somewhat. Without 
sustained 
pressure 
from 
a 
general mass of progressives, 
would entities like Twitter and 
Politicon have taken action 
against Yiannopoulo’s in the 
first place?
Political 
celebrities 
provide a circuitous method of 
advertising. Radical websites 
can’t pay for ads in The New York 
Times, but their figureheads 
serve a nearly indistinguishable 

purpose 
simply 
by 
being 
covered. 
“De-platforming” 
Yiannopoulos, 
however 
it 
happens, robs his fans of a 
valuable resource: access to the 
mainstream press. Furthermore, 
feeling marginalized suppresses 
meaningful political activity; 
by reducing the clout of a 
movement’s leaders, you reduce 
its efficacy overall.
This isn’t a groundbreaking 
observation, 
admittedly; 
there’s a reason people like 
Trump, former State Secretary 
Hillary 
Clinton 
and 
New 
York congressional candidate 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez draw 
so much sustained criticism 
and attention. The difference 
between 
a 
politician 
like 
Clinton and a media figure 
like Yiannopoulos, though, is 
institutional power — influential 
politicians 
can 
raise 
their 
defenses in situations where a 
more isolated private citizen 
cannot. 
Yiannopoulos 
didn’t 
have the institutional power 
necessary to preserve his status.
Was it protest, though, that 
collapsed Yiannopoulo’s career? 
Initially, his importance came 
from his ability to provoke 
direct action from supposedly 
deranged college liberals — in 
other words, protests. Now, 
ceteris 
paribus, 
deranged 
college liberals are responsible 
for Yiannopoulo’s decline? His 
departure from Breitbart and 
expulsion from Twitter both 
occurred after media scandals; 
if 
protests 
had 
continued, 
sustaining his reputation, I 
find it hard to believe that 
either Breitbart or the Mercer 
family would have reacted.
Protests 
signal 
some 
segment of the country — and 
therefore 
some 
segment 
of 
consumers — find someone’s 
brand so repulsive that they’re 
willing to show up in person 
and spend their time repeating 
their outrage. They don’t, for a 
provocateur like Yiannopoulos, 
scare 
away 
funding 
that’s 
already signed up for public 
stunts and drama. Some might 
argue violent protest, as carried 
out by segments of antifa, is the 
key; if Yiannopoulos cannot 

speak 
because 
of 
security 
concerns, he’s clearly being 
“de-platformed” (at least in 
one area). There remain dozens 
of 
other 
platforms, 
though 
(television, social media, etc.), 
where 
threats 
of 
violence 
are 
ineffective. 
Physically 
preventing 
someone 
from 
speaking on one campus or 
another does not prevent them 
from speaking to millions of 
fans online, or millions of live 
TV viewers.
I believe protests are an 
important 
demonstration 
of solidarity and a way of 
demonstrating the strength of 
one’s conviction. I’m also not 
shedding any tears for wildly 
popular, 
well-compensated 
celebrities being denied the 
chance to make money and 
headlines on college campuses, 
either. I am still unconvinced, 
however, that direct action with 
the goal of “de-platforming” 
people like Yiannopoulos is 
enough. Preventing someone 
from speaking on campus may 
be 
an 
independently 
good 
thing, but it doesn’t appear 
effective toward the larger 
cause of removing someone 
from the public stage. The 
journalist who publicized that 
clip of Yiannopoulos appearing 
to defend pedophilia did more 
damage to his career than all 
of the people involved in the 
subsequent protests, for all of 
their righteous intentions.
It seems likely we’ll have at 
least one campus controversy 
this academic year over a 
speaker on campus, and there 
will — and should — be protests. 
Organizing them with the goal 
of “de-platforming,” though, 
is to misunderstand the way 
political 
celebrities 
wield 
and grow influence. Denying 
someone space to speak is 
clearly effective, but only when 
that denial is far reaching and 
total — “de-platforming” one 
head of the hydra does not 
prevent it from growing back 
two more elsewhere.

More than just a teen romance

AMANDA ZHANG | COLUMN

T

he 
summer 
of 
2018 
marks the revival of the 
romantic 
comedy, 
or 
rom-com — a genre once often 
overlooked as artistically lazy 
and trite. With major box office 
hits like “Mamma Mia! Here 
We Go Again” and “Crazy Rich 
Asians,” it seems as though 
Americans have finally admitted 
to themselves an architect racing 
against time to stop his one true 
love from boarding a plane is 
both exhilarating and satisfying. 
As a lifelong fan of the classically 
cheesy tropes native to the rom-
com, I was not particularly 
shocked by the genre’s return 
to the spotlight, but I was 
pleasantly surprised to see the 
influx of Asian representation, 
especially 
in 
the 
Netflix 
original film “To All the Boys 
I’ve Loved Before.”
Adapted from fiction author 
Jenny Han’s young adult novel 
and 
starring 
Vietnamese-
American actress Lana Condor, 
“To All the Boys I’ve Loved 
Before” follows Lara Jean Covey, 
an endearingly awkward half-
Korean, 
half-white 
teenage 
girl, after five of her privately 
written 
love 
letters 
are 
unexpectedly mailed out. To 
avoid confronting a recipient 
of one of the letters, Covey 
begins a fake relationship with 
recently single Peter Kavinsky, 
and teenage romance ensues.
On its surface, the film is light 
and lovable 
— the ideal late-night 
Netflix indulgence. But as an 
Asian-American girl who grew 
up watching countless rom-coms 
in which none of the female 
protagonists had skin, hair or 
eyes like mine, “To All the Boys 
I’ve Loved Before” is much more 
than a jovial tale of young love — 
it is a stark reminder that until 
very recently, Asian-Americans 
have had virtually no leading 
roles in Hollywood.
As much as I value what 
actors like Jackie Chan and Ken 
Jeong have done for the Asian 
community, I would prefer the 
representation 
of 
my 
entire 
race on the big screen were not 
limited to kung-fu masters and 
Mr. Chow from “The Hangover.” 
Enter Covey, a relatable 16-year-
old girl who just happens to be 
half Korean. That’s it. Covey does 
not embody any classic Asian 
stereotypes. She is not timid like 
that freakishly quiet beatboxer 

Lily from “Pitch Perfect” or 
saddled 
by 
an 
overbearing 
tiger parent like Lane from 
“Gilmore Girls.” Instead, Covey 
is articulate and actually funny. 
Her primary concern in life 
is a fake relationship with a 
cute boy and, before leaving 
for her school’s annual ski 
trip, she endured a painfully 
uncomfortable sex talk with 
her father.
Covey is the classic female 
rom-com protagonist. Yes, she is 
half Korean, but it is the subtlety 
with which her ethnicity is 
incorporated that makes “To 
All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” 
such an important work. This 

film represents an extraordinary 
moment 
for 
Asians 
in 
Hollywood, 
not 
because 
it 
blatantly censures deeply rooted 
racism in the film industry, but 
simply because the lead is Asian 
and her ethnicity is neither a 
statement nor a punchline.
Despite the fact that Covey’s 
Korean heritage is never a central 
plot point in the film, it does not 
go 
completely 
unrecognized. 
“To All the Boys I’ve Loved 
Before” includes a number of 
refreshingly subtle scenes that 
introduce aspects of Korean 
culture. In one of my favorite 
moments, Kavinsky is picking 
up Covey and her little sister on 
the way to school and asks what 
her sister is drinking. She is 
drinking a Korean yogurt called 
Yakuroto commonly found in 
Asian grocery markets. The 
charming love interest gives the 
yogurt a try and playfully strikes 
a deal with the sister, promising 
to take her to school every day 
in exchange for a bottle. The 

scene is an endearing moment in 
which Kavinsky begins to win 
over Covey’s precocious little 
sister, but it is also a delightful 
example of open-mindedness 
and cultural exchange.
Growing up as a child of 
Chinese 
immigrants, 
I 
was 
always slightly hesitant to reveal 
aspects of my culture. Out of fear 
of appearing unconventional, I 
used forks instead of chopsticks 
around my white friends and 
always suggested going to other 
people’s houses to hang out. 
While I have since overcome this 
anxiety, Kavinsky’s immediately 
positive reaction to the yogurt 
and the casual manner with 
which they discuss it are a 
gentle reminder that exposure 
to different lifestyles is the key 
to promoting a more integrative 
and 
inclusive 
society. 
The 
film’s subtle nod to a common 
Asian household item offers 
a 
powerful 
message 
that 
Hollywood thus far has largely 
neglected 
— 
our 
different 
backgrounds are not meant to 
be tucked away at home, but 
instead shared with others.
Though Asians have seen a 
rise in Hollywood representation 
this summer, there are still 
massive strides to be made as 
the film and television industry 
is still replete with archaic 
standards of beauty and worth. 
When she was first approaching 
production 
companies 
to 
convert her novel into a film, 
Han reportedly turned down 
multiple offers after producers 
pressured her to whitewash 
Covey. This is not particularly 
surprising, considering it took 
a quarter-century for a major 
motion picture to anchor a 
predominantly Asian cast with 
this summer’s box office hit, 
“Crazy Rich Asians.”
Needless to say, these films 
featuring Asian leads were not 
produced without their fair share 
of adversity. “To All the Boys I’ve 
Loved Before” is a momentous 
film for the Asian community, 
but it is not enough for the 
little girls like me who grow up 
believing only white women 
deserve to be fantastically swept 
off their feet. Hollywood needs 
to do better.
Political discourse 
needs to be 
open and factual 
discourse. 

Though Asians 
have seen a rise 
in Hollywood 
representation 
this summer, 
there are still 
massive strides to 
be made.

‘Miseducation’ is relatable 
for some, important for all

The communal experience 

of seeing a movie in theaters 
is 
often 
underappreciated. 

It’s a good way to be more 
engaged with the film than 
alternating between Netflix on 
your computer and Twitter on 
your phone every 10 minutes. 
There’s a certain charm to 
watching the newest “Star 
Wars” 
or 
Marvel 
vehicle 

with 
a 
slap-happy, 
hype-

fed audience that makes an 
opening weekend blockbuster 
unforgettable. 
All 
movies 

don’t 
have 
action-packed 

conclusions 
and 
fulfilling 

endings though; some leave 
you still processing what just 
transpired for the last hour or 
two. The prevailing remark 
from most walking out of 
“Sorry to Bother You” was 
“what the fuck just happened,” 
while my fellow “Hereditary” 
goers 
mixed 
silence 
with 

shocked facial expressions.

And then there’s movies 

like 
“The 
Miseducation 
of 

Cameron Post,” movies that 
provoke people in the theater 
to exclaim “that’s it?” when the 
credits roll. This movie may 
wind up being a divisive film 
simply for the fact that one’s 
enjoyment of it is directly tied 
to how much it resonates with 
them — non-teen, non-queer 
audiences might just not get it. 
While it only taps into specific 
sensibilities, the movie still 
has an enriching, powerful 
message that everyone should 
appreciate.

The story follows the titular 

high schooler (Chloë Grace 
Moretz, “Neighbors 2: Sorority 
Rising”) in early ’90s Montana. 
An orphan who lives with her 
religious aunt, Cameron is 
sent to God’s Promise, a gay 
conversion 
therapy 
camp, 

after she’s caught making out 
with her friend Coley in the 
backseat of her boyfriend’s car 
during prom. What follows is 
not much, actually, as Cameron 
is forced to integrate into God’s 
Promise and adjust to this new 

life as scenes of high-intensity 
drama pepper the narrative.

This superficial mundanity 

is hard to peel away. But when 
the film manages to do so, it 
reveals a heart that is primarily 
concerned 
with 
Cameron 

coming to embrace her own 
identity 
and 
personhood. 

This is brought about, not 
by any life-changing event 
or transformation, but the 
world around her. Cameron’s 
arc may seem static, but she 
tacitly moves and adapts to her 
changing environment.

Nothing wraps up nicely 

in 
“The 
Miseducation 
of 

Cameron Post.” The trauma of 
the residents of God’s Promise 
is brought to the forefront only 
to be left there. Fellow campers 
Jane 
Fonda 
(Sasha 
Lane, 

“American Honey”) and Adam 
Red Eagle (Forrest Goodluck, 
“The Revenant”) make quick 
friends with Cameron and have 
similar inertia towards their 
own sexual orientations. They 
seem surprising targets to end 
up at God’s Promise — Jane was 
raised in a hippie commune 
and Adam believes in his 
tribe’s non-gender-conforming 
“two-spirit” philosophy — but 
they’re there regardless.

The camp itself is run by the 

kindhearted Reverend Rick, 
an “ex-gay” played by John 
Gallagher, 
Jr. 
(“The 
Belko 

Experiment”) in a satisfying 
subtle performance, and his 
sister, 
the 
oppressive 
Dr. 

Lydia March (Jennifer Ehle, 
“Fifty Shades Freed”). Rick is 
slowly revealed to be a tragic 
character himself, as he was 
a guinea pig for his sister to 
force upon the same brand of 

“therapy” that they now make 
a living off of. Meanwhile, 
Lydia is the closest thing “The 
Miseducation 
of 
Cameron 

Post” has to an antagonist 
(Adam labels her as a “Disney 
villain that doesn’t let you 
masturbate”), but she is not 
exactly a Nurse Ratched type 
that threatens Cameron with 
electroshock therapy.

In fact, “Cameron Post” 

has no fiery conclusion, no 
explosive confrontation that 
marks the peak of the action. 
It drapes itself with coming-
of-age tropes only to pull them 
away to unveil a wholly unique 
story when the 90-minute 
runtime comes to an end.

No one depicted in “The 

Miseducation 
of 
Cameron 

Post” is inherently evil; the 
only evil is the idea of such a 
conversion camp even existing 
(while it may seem far-fetched, 
facilities like the one depicted 
still exist to this day). Cameron, 
Jane, Adam and all the other 
campers are not physically 
mistreated at God’s Promise, 
only pushed to their emotional 
limits. And while some bend to 
the Christian rhetoric of the 
camp, others break.

After a traumatic event that 

leaves the campers scarred and 
the administrators questioning 
how it could have happened, a 
state investigator is sent in 
to monitor the conditions of 
the camp. In a conversation 
where he questions Cameron 
if there is any ongoing abuse, 
Cameron maintains that she is 
not being physically harmed, 
but raises the question: “How 
is 
programming 
people 
to 

hate themselves not emotional 
abuse?”

Therein lies the core of “The 

Miseducation 
of 
Cameron 

Post.” 
While 
Cameron’s 

story takes precedence, the 
emotional vignettes of the 
other 
teens 
she 
is 
newly 

surrounded 
by 
prove 
that 

although invisible, self-love 
and acceptance will always 
be a more powerful agent 
of positive change than any 
forced 
method 
manifested 

from hate.

FILM REVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW

Every time one of my favorite 

artists releases a new album, 
I get a little nervous. It’s not 
necessarily because I don’t 
have faith in them to put out 
something mind-blowing; it’s 
just that I’m scared their new 
music will change how I view 
their discography as a whole 
and the memories I have with 
that band. The more music 
a band puts out, the more of 
themselves they’re exposing. 
In recent memory, bands like 
Arcade 
Fire, 
Interpol 
and 

Weezer have gone from debut 
albums that received critical 
acclaim to albums that received 
extremely mixed reviews, in 
many instances giving off the 
perception that the band sold 
out as not only musicians, but 
also people.

So when I heard the first 

single “Gold Rush” off of Death 
Cab for Cutie’s latest album 
Thank You for Today, I became 
a 
little 
nervous. 
The 
new 

song was catchy, but it felt so 
different from their previous 
work. I couldn’t tell if it was the 
Yoko Ono sample, or the lyrics, 
but it felt off. I didn’t want it to 
change the way I listen to Death 
Cab, the band that’s been with 
me through the majority of my 
emotional teenage life.

But the Death Cab that put 

out some of my favorite albums 
like Transatlanticism, The Photo 
Album and especially We Have 
the Facts and We’re Voting Yes 
is now over 20-years-old. To 
expect them to continue putting 
out the same music that they 
were putting out back then is to 
expect the band to refrain from 
any sort of musical growth — a 
band that lacks growth lacks 
maturity and artistry.

And grow they have. Not 

only does this album feature a 
completely new lineup for the 
band, with the departure of 
Chris Walla after 17 years of 
playing guitar and producing 
for the band, and the addition 
of Zac Rae and Dave Depper 
(who I had the privilege of 
interviewing last month), but 
also features a sound different 
from any Death Cab album in 
the past.

Although 
it 
could 
be 

compared to Narrow Stairs, 
the album features drastically 
different 
songwriting 
and 

sonic textures. They’ve never 

shied from incorporating keys 
and synths into their music, 
and the addition of a full-time 
keyboardist shines through in 
all of the new songs. In every 
song, there’s at least some sort 
of ambient pad backing things 

up, or a Rhodes electric piano 
accompanying guitar, or even 
acoustic piano. But although 
the core sounds of a Death Cab 
instrumental are there, it all 
still feels a little different.

Dave Depper does a great job 

at creating those lead guitar 
lines Chris Walla was so adept 
at, but some of the lines feel 
less risky. They feel like they’re 
missing a little bit of grit. 
Granted, this is a completely 
different album from some of 
Death Cab’s older, “heavier” 
stuff, but certain moments like 
the last half of “Summer Years,” 
brings back a little bit of that 
grit that Death Cab used so well, 
and so sparingly. The songs are 
catchy, but not too corny (with 
the 
exception 
of 
“Autumn 

Love,” which may be one of 
Death Cab’s weakest songs.)

But, Nick Harmer and Jason 

McGerr continue to hold it down 
in the rhythm section, giving 
performances as solid as any 
previous Death Cab record. The 
band sounds different, but the 
new members seem to make it 
sound more complete. However, 
Walla’s production touch still 
feels a little bit lost. One thing 
that really stood out about 
Death Cab records was how 
crisp and dynamic they were. 
Thank You For Today seems a 
little more compressed than 
previous records, but still feels 
clear. However, contemporary 
indie rockers Foxing’s most 
recent record, Nearer My God, 
which was produced by Walla, 
is unsurprisingly comparable to 
old Death Cab records.

However, as good as their 

songs are instrumentally, the 
band is nothing without Ben 
Gibbard’s lyricism and sense 
of songwriting. Best known for 
writing lyrics that span from 
overwhelmingly depressing to 
incredibly romantic, Gibbard’s 
role as the lead vocalist and 

songwriter in the group is 
a position that has gained 
widespread fame for the group.

Originally, I thought that one 

of my biggest complaints about 
this record was going to be the 
lack of growth from a band 
that has been around almost as 
long as I have been alive. And 
while they have grown slightly 
instrumentally, 
Gibbard’s 

vocals and songwriting ability 
have aged like a fine wine. His 
voice somehow has gotten more 
delicate and smooth as he has 
aged.

But the biggest contribution 

Gibbard has on this record 
are his lyrics. My initial draw 
to Death Cab as an angsty 
teenager was Gibbard’s songs 
about 
heartbreak, 
love 
and 

relationships, but hearing a 
married 40-year-old sing about 
those things would feel kind of 
weird. Luckily, as Gibbard has 
matured, so have the basis of his 
lyrics (I used to joke about how 
happy I was when he and Zooey 
Deschanel split because of how 
good his lyrics were when he 
was in a sadder state, as cruel as 
that sounds).

Although 
Ben’s 
happily 

married again, he still sings 
about things he’s passionate 
about. The first single from 
the album, “Gold Rush,” for 
example, is about the expansion 
of the tech industry in the 
band’s 
hometown. 
Although 

the message might be kind of 
overdone (see: get off your stupid 
phone, you dumb kids), it’s done 
in a fresh and compelling way. 
Songs like “When We Drive” 
and “60 & Punk” feel more 
grown 
up, 
commenting 
on 

relationships and realizing that 
your idols aren’t as great as you 
once thought they were.

After the first few listens, I 

was getting ready to talk about 
the regression of one of my 
favorite bands. But the more I 
put off writing this and listened 
to the record, the more those 
bad comments started to turn 
into good ones. A lot of people 
are likely to give this record a 
listen and write it off as being 
a mediocre indie rock record. 
But it deserves more credit. 
When you listen to this in the 
context of the rest of the band’s 
discography, 
it’s 
clear 
that 

while the band has maintained 
the elements that brought them 
such critical acclaim, they’re 
also embracing the modern era 
of music they find themselves 
in.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW 

RCA

Donald Glover, better known 

musically by his pseudonym, 
Childish Gambino, has existed 
alone on an island in the corner 
of the hip-hop world since his 
first mixtape, Camp. Technically 
speaking, he isn’t tied to any 
of the rap conglomerates of 
his peers, like Kanye West’s 
G.O.O.D. Music Label or Drake’s 
OVO Sound Label. What’s more, 
his prominence can’t really be 
credited to anyone but himself, 
something that cannot be said 
for artists like Chance the 
Rapper and Travis Scott, who 
received endorsements from 
already established acts during 
their come-ups. In short, Glover 
is a lone wolf. This status affords 
him a unique perspective in the 
hip-hop world, one through 
which he can neutrally observe 
trends; this lense is exposed in 
the newly released music video 
for his melancholic sunset track, 
“Feels Like Summer.”

The video in a nutshell: An 

animated Glover, looking jaded 
with tired eyes and a rugged 

beard, strolls down a suburban 
street with headphones in his 
ears and hands in his pockets. 
Around him, prominent figures 

in hip hop take part in various 
scenes that insightfully speak 
on the state of the popular genre 
today. Drake chases Future, 
who rides into the sunset on a 
bicycle; Nicki Minaj and Travis 
Scott 
play 
with 
children’s 

blocks; Lil Pump and Trippie 
Redd skip around like toddlers 
and seek attention from 21 
Savage and Kodak Black; most 
interestingly, Michelle Obama 
comforts a crying Kanye West. 
Through it all, Glover looks 
tired and almost desperate for a 
new order.

Through 
these 
images, 

Glover brilliantly allegorizes the 
hip-hop world in 2018: Drake 
owes much of his prominence 
to Future’s influence; Lil Pump 
and Trippie Redd compete with 
acts like 21 Savage and Kodak 
Black, but have a significantly 
less 
mature 
image; 
Nicki 

Minaj has been bickering over 
Astroworld’s dominance of her 
Queen; Kanye West infamously 
made major waves with a Trump 
endorsement over the summer. 
Amidst all of hubbub, Glover 
has remained a true boundary-
pushing artist while avoiding 
negative press and trivial feuds, 
relying solely on his talent by 
embracing the aforementioned 
lone wolf characteristic. Based 
on the emphatic images of 
his new music video, it seems 
Glover has also been a silent 
observer of the music world 
around him, steering clear of 
the bad, learning from the good 
and establishing himself as hip 
hop’s wise man.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Thursday, September 6, 2018 — 5


races, but nobody really wants 
to talk about it. As school board 
member 
Dr. 
Jackie 
Moore 

points out, “If you’re feeling 
as though you can’t be honest 
or you’re afraid to say what 
you’re feeling because there’s a 
camera there and we’re talking 
about race, what camera’s in 
your head when you’re going 
through your day?”

While the adults in power 

may not be willing to talk 
about race or the role it plays 
in everyday life, the students 
of O.P.R.F. certainly have a 
lot to say. The series excels in 
showing the parallel between 
Black students who deal with 
disadvantages related to their 
race and the normal, awkward 
adolescent experience of going 
to high school. In one scene, 
sophomore Tiara is shown 
talking about the pressures of 
living with her sister. Tiara’s 
sister has a son at O.P.R.F. 
whom the school has essentially 
given up on. She says her sister 
wants her to succeed more than 
anything because she could not 
get her son to do the same. Not 
soon after this, Tiara is seen 
auditioning for the choir, and 
then jumping up and down in 
the hallway because the boy 
she auditioned in front of has 
been her crush since seventh 
grade.

Little moments like these 

are 
why 
the 
documentary 

is 
so 
effective. 
It 
shows 

how although O.P.R.F. isn’t 
necessarily 
separate: 
The 

students 
are 
anything 
but 

equal. At school, the only thing 
white students have to worry 

about is a quiz they have coming 
up or running into their crush 
or what friend to sit with in 
class. Black students are faced 
with all of this, along with the 
added pressure of being treated 
differently due to the color of 
their skin and what that has 
meant for them for years. Race 
is ingrained in every aspect of 
O.P.R.F., and one teacher points 
out that “no space in this school 
is race neutral.” Some instances 
are more ingrained, such as the 
tendencies of kids of the same 

race to sit with each other in 
the cafeteria. Others appear to 
be blatant racism. In one scene, 
a school administrator explains 
how 
the 
primarily 
Black 

cheerleading squad has to 
perform on the edge of the field 
while the mostly white drill 
team does their routine front 
and center. As junior Charles 
points out with frustration: 
“Everything is made for white 
kids, because this school was 
made for white kids, because 
this country was made for 
white kids.”

“America to Me” tells the 

story 
of 
a 
racist 
America 

through young voices that are 
too often belittled and ignored. 
These high schoolers have no 
problem telling America that 
they feel as if they don’t belong. 
O.P.R.F. may just be one high 
school, but it is reflective of 
something much bigger. Even 
integrated, progressive schools 
are struggling to provide an 
equal 
experience 
for 
their 

Black and white students. The 
first step to addressing the 
problem is talking about it, 
something that clearly many 
people do not want to do. 
“America to Me” is pushing that 
conversation forward, forcing 
both the people at O.P.R.F. and 
the audience watching them 
to listen to a discussion about 
race and go on to start one 
themselves.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

Release Date: Thursday, September 6, 2018

Among the many fans of 

Tom 
Clancy’s 
best-selling 

“Jack 
Ryan” 
novels 
was 

Ronald Reagan, who called 
the first of the spy thriller 
series “unputdownable.” “Tom 
Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” Amazon 
Video’s 
new 
eight-episode 

addition to the franchise is 
— sorry, Mr. Reagan — quite 
putdownable. That’s not to say it 
isn’t occasionally entertaining. 
It has its moments. But too 
often, “Jack Ryan” lapses into 
stale, passé story patterns that 
leave it struggling to breathe 
life into a tired genre.

In his decades of book and 

on-screen 
appearances, 
the 

character Jack Ryan has been 
on the receiving end of dozens 
of Bond-like reincarnations and 
reinventions. Alec Baldwin’s 
Jack Ryan was a wide-eyed, 
brainy type; Harrison Ford’s 
a gruff, seasoned hothead. 
He’s been a history professor 
and a Wall Street banker and 
President of the United States. 
But in every iteration he’s the 
reluctant hero, the sort who 
has greatness thrust upon him. 
“I’m just an analyst. I write 
reports!” Ryan pleas, usually 
before 
being 
tasked 
with 

resolving all sorts of absurd, 
world-ending 
plots 
— 
like 

extremists taking advantage 
of a power vacuum in Iraq 
or Kremlin interference at 
the highest levels of the US 
government (OK, maybe not 
that absurd).

The 
small 
screen 
Jack 

Ryan (John Krasinski, “The 
Office”) 
keeps 
squarely 
in 

that tradition. He’s a CIA 

analyst on a counterterrorism 
team 
reviewing 
suspicious 

financial transactions — and 
presumably, writing reports — 
when he stumbles on a lead that 
takes him directly to Mousa bin 
Suleiman (Ali Suliman, “The 
Looming Tower”), a Syrian 
jihadist thought to be the next 
bin Laden. Under the guidance 

of his new section chief James 
Greer (Wendell Pierce, “The 
Wire”), Ryan is — as Jack Ryan 
is wont to be — hesitantly 
dragged into a chase that takes 
him from his humble desk at 
Langley to field missions in the 
slums of Paris and Yemen.

Krasinski’s 
Ryan 
is 

convincing, muscled and stoic, 
of course, but with an easiness 
and boyish charm that earn him 
the 
moniker 
“self-righteous 

Boy 
Scout” 
in 
the 
show’s 

pilot. Morality, unfortunately, 
does not a personality make 
— more often than not, Jack 
fails to come across as real or 
lived-in. At times, he’s saddled 
with lines so groan-worthy it 
wouldn’t feel particularly out 
of place for Krasinski to turn 
and flash a stare at the camera 
à la Jim Halpert, as if to say, 
“You see what I have to deal 
with here?”

He’s dealing with a lot. 

Pierce’s 
pitch-perfect 
Greer 

aside, 
Krasinski 
has 
little 

chemistry with his co-stars, 

least of all with Abbie Cornish 
(“Three 
Billboards 
Outside 

Ebbing, Missouri”) as Dr. Cathy 
Mueller, Ryan’s vanilla love 
interest. And the story, though 
well-paced, is little more than 
another regurgitation of every 
spy thriller released in the last 
10 years. The extensive focus 
on Suleiman and on telling the 
story of his upbringing and 
radicalization seem designed 
to pre-empt any criticism of the 
show’s depictions of terrorists. 
But it’s still not enough to 
provoke thought or add needed 
nuance.

And given all the opportunity 

for 
real 
complexity 
and 

excitement the spy thriller 
provides, it’s almost puzzling 
that 
a 
streaming 
service 

with no shortage of money 
could produce such ordinary 
television. A far cry from 
the twisty, thoughtful cable 
dramas that have dealt with 
espionage 
in 
recent 
years, 

“Jack 
Ryan” 
more 
closely 

resembles a mid-aughts CBS 
procedural or Fox’s miserable, 
jingoistic “24.” There is none 
of the rewarding slow burn 
or 
meticulousness 
of 
early 

“Homeland,” nothing close to 
the delicate psychological study 
that was “The Americans.” 
Even the action sequences feel 
straight out of a Michael Bay 
(“Transformers”) film, cheap 
and gratuitous — to be fair, 
Michael Bay is, in fact, one of 
the show’s producers.

What’s the use in watching, 

anyway? We know how this 
ends — neatly black and white. 
The bad terrorists lose, the 
handsome 
good 
guys 
with 

guns win and our exceptional 
country lives to see another 
day. It’s no wonder Reagan 
liked Jack Ryan so much.

Season 1

America is in the midst 

of 
an 
identity 
crisis. 
A 

nation 
supposedly 
built 
on 

a 
foundation 
of 
equality, 

acceptance and opportunity is 
currently masked 
by the ugly light 
of hate, bigotry 
and hopelessness. 
Pop 
culture 
is 

attempting 
to 

help 
Americans 

understand what is happening 
to their country. Sacha Baron 
Cohen tries to expose the ugly 
underbelly 
of 
contemporary 

America with his new HBO 
series titled “Who is America?,” 
in which he disguises himself 
to ask politicians, public figures 
and 
everyday 
Americans 

about 
their 
often 
insulting 

or ridiculous views. Rapper 
Childish 
Gambino 
offers 
a 

response to Cohen’s titular 
question with the song “This 
is America,” a song whose 

video artfully examines the 
problems that Black people face 
in America.

“America to Me” offers a 

more personalized commentary 
than either of these, and it 
is not shy in proclaiming its 
purpose. At the end of Starz’s 
10-part docuseries, “America 
to Me,” a short excerpt from a 

Langston Hughes 
poem 
fills 
up 

the 
screen. 

“O, yes, I say it 
plain,” it begins. 
“America 
never 

was, 
America 

to me, And yet I swear this 
oath — America will be!” 
Hughes, a Black writer and 
activist who was a leader of the 
Harlem Renaissance, is talking 
about how he feels as if he is 
a stranger living in his own 
country. America is supposed 
to be a place where anybody 
can succeed, yet as a Black man, 
Hughes does not feel like he is 
enjoying the benefits of living 
in America — at least not yet.

It is the perfect sentiment 

to end the premiere episode of 

“America to Me,” a series that 
for one school year followed 
students attending Oak Park 
and River Forest High School 
(O.P.R.F.) in suburban Chicago. 
In an area that the series makes 
a point of telling viewers is 
young and liberal, O.P.R.F. 
appears to be a diverse school 
succeeding in addressing and 
highlighting 
that 
diversity. 

The school is 55-percent white 
and 
27-percent 
Black, 
and 

through research and meetings 
the administration seems to 
recognize disparities between 
their Black and white students 
and want to repair them. None 
of the administration will talk 
to the filmmakers about that 
research, and director Steve 
James (“Hoop Dreams”) tells 
the audience that the principal 
and 
superintendent 
of 
the 

school didn’t even want the 
film to be made.

This alone shows exactly 

why it is so important that 
this documentary was made. 
People know this country has 
institutionalized racism and 
blatant 
disparities 
between 

‘America to Me’ catalyzes 
conversations about race

Michigan in Color

Information 
senior 
Nisa 
Khan participated in a summer-
long program with a grant from 
the Knight Foundation and 
hosted by the Craig Newmark 
Journalism School (previously 
known as the CUNY-J school). 
Located in New York, this 
diversity initiative trains 20 
young 
journalists 
of 
color, 
funding their expenses and 
connecting 
them 
to 
media 
companies 
throughout 
the 
city. Khan interned with the 
investigative reporting outlet 
ProPublica.
How did you hear about 
your internship? What made 
you want to apply?
It took a lot of Googling. 
There 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
really 
amazing, extremely generous 
scholarships and programs out 
there that I wouldn’t have been 
aware of without the many hours 

researching. I came across the 
Knight-CUNYJ program a few 
times in internship listings.
What are your favorite 
memories 
from 
your 
experience?
New York is really fun, as 
it turns out. Even the media 
training by the initiative was 
a fulfilling time. But having 
my first story published was 
the most relieving, wonderful 
experience.
We also went out for karaoke 
and I repped Michigan by 
singing Mr. Brightside. I don’t 
care if anyone thinks it’s basic. 
It’s still a banger my 2009 
middle school self loved and no 
amount of football tailgates can 
take that away from me.
What is the culture like in 
your program?
The 
Knight-CUNYJ 
is 
a 
wonderful program if you are 

a person of color who aims 
to go into this industry. You 
get a great support group 
and 
teachers 
of 
a 
similar 
background. You are trained in 
a wide array of multimedia tools 
that are important to the field. 
You are worked hard — I was 
bone-deep tired every day, but 
that’s the expectation.
I got along with my cohort 
so well — I made some amazing 
friends and we all carried each 
other through an exhausting 
and rewarding few months. A 
guy saw me cry three days in a 
row and I don’t really consider 
myself a crier. He doesn’t 
believe me when I say that and 
that’s okay.
I 
would 
100 
percent 
recommend anyone to apply to 
this program when applications 
open early next year.

Intern Diaries: Part One

Summer 
has 
unfortunately 
come to a close, and at Michigan 
in Color, it’s a tad bittersweet. 
Though many of us are excited 
to come back to the Daily office 
for more shenanigans, we’re also 
sad to leave the places we spent 
out internships in. We’re trading 
business professional attire for 
the office for the casual and 
comfy clothes we usually wear in 
college. Here, a few MiC editors 
wanted to share their summer 
stories of hustling, learning, and 
the importance of diversity in the 
workplace. 
Rising Public Health senior 
Christian Paneda took to the 
famous (or infamous, depending 
on how one wants to look at it) 
Washington, D.C., to intern at the 
U.S. House of Representatives. 
His 
work 
was 
assisted 
by 
the 
Asian 
Pacific 
American 
Institute 
of 
Congressional 
Studies, a bi-partisan non-profit 
organization dedicated to build 
Asian-American 
and 
Pacific 
Islander representation in public 
service at local, state and national 
levels. 
The 
organization’s 
summer 
internship 
program 
allows AAPI students to explore 
the 
intricacies 
of 
the 
U.S. 
Congress. Paneda interned for 
the office of Rep. Mark Takano, 
D-Calif, the first openly gay 
person of color to ever serve in 
Congress.
How did you hear about 
your internship?
I heard about APAICS from 
multiple sources. When I was 
talking to a former senior MiC 
editor, the incomparable Areeba 
Haider, 
on 
opportunities 
to 
intern in Washington, D.C., she 

knew a couple of people from 
the program and recommended 
to apply. At the same time, one 
of my close mentors, who is 
actually a D.C. superstar, was 
involved with APAICS through 
their fellowship program and 
advised me that the program 
was one of the best internship 
opportunities. Both of them 
weren’t wrong!
What made you want to 
apply?
I’ve always had a passion 
for policy. In the field of public 
health, we talk a lot about how 
the law and policy affects the 
health of a population, especially 
those who are marginalized 
due to a variety of social 
determinants. I wanted to intern 
in Washington, D.C., to get a 
hands-on perspective in the 
policy-making process and learn 
more about advocacy. Especially 
since we live in an abnormal time 
that threatens the livelihood of 
so many people of color, I wanted 
to take action. I applied to 
APAICS because I aligned with 
their mission of building the 
AAPI pipeline, because diverse 
representation is essential for 
equitable policy. In the Midwest 
communities of AAPIs, I’ve 
heard a lot of mistrust of the 
government (local, state and 
national), thus leading to a 
sense of apathy toward civic 
engagement. I wanted to combat 
that as I believe an individual’s 
voice can hold a lot of power 
when it’s in solidarity with 
others.
What are your favorite 
memories 
from 
your 
experience?
I 
absolutely 
loved 
every 
moment of my internship! I 
enjoyed learning about issue 
areas I am extremely passionate 

about – education, immigration 
and health policy. Outside of 
many of my intern tasks, I was 
given the opportunity to do some 
other cool things. I delivered a 
couple of speeches – one included 
me introducing the congressman 
at a congressional event! In 
Washington, D.C., APAICS really 
afforded me the opportunity to 
sit down with AAPI trailblazers 
who have fought for people like 
me to live unapologetically. I 
found their sacrifice and their 
stories to be inspirational.
What is the culture like 
where you interned?
The Hill can be an intense 
place. As it seems like horrifying 
news is hitting every week, one 
can imagine the daunting yet 
necessary work needed to protect 
many 
different 
marginalized 
communities. Working in policy 
takes dedication, perseverance 
and optimism. What I am 
also very thankful for is the 
AAPI community in D.C. I was 
surprised to find out how tight-
knit the community is, and I am 
even more thankful that they 
were so kind to me as a bright-
eyed intern.
Any advice for prospective 
interns interested in public 
service?
I’ve come to learn that success 
is not individualistic. It is crucial 
to find mentors in fields you’re 
interested in and that can vouch 
for your work. That said, I also do 
not recommend burning bridges 
as everything in public service is 
related to community. Be genuine 
with your connections! I’ve 
heard a lot about transactional 
relationships in D.C., and from 
what I’ve observed, collaborative 
work gets accomplished and 
best sustained when a genuine 
connection is established.

Martin, Bell to receive more snaps against Western Michigan this week

While 
a 
disintegrating 
offensive line and mistake-prone 
defense drew most of the attention 
against Notre Dame on Saturday, 
Michigan’s wide receivers played 
their best game in nearly two 
years.
In the 24-17 defeat, sophomores 
Nico Collins, Donovan Peoples-
Jones and Oliver Martin, as well 
as fifth-year senior Grant Perry, 
combined for 181 yards on 17 
catches. It marked the position 
group’s largest output since Nov. 
5, 2016, when Wilton Speight set a 
program record for passing yards 
in a half.
The Wolverines’ passing game 
sputtered in 2017, largely due to 
the struggles of their wideouts, 
who combined to catch just three 
touchdowns all season. Perry, 
their leading receiver, managed a 
paltry 307 yards.
But on Saturday, the group 
consistently beat the Fighting 
Irish secondary — especially in 
short-yardage situations — and 
allowed Michigan to move the ball 
despite rushing for just 58 yards.
“I thought we had pretty 
good 
separation 
throughout 
the game,” said receivers coach 
Jim McElwain. “It’s something 
you work on every single day, 
and our guys I think have seen 
the importance of it. … They’ve 
responded well to being conscious 
of gaining separation.”
Wolverine receivers mentioned 
that as a priority throughout spring 
and summer camp. They credited 
McElwain — who was the head 
coach at Florida from 2015 to 2017 
— with teaching them subtleties to 
the position that have aided their 
growth from a season ago.
It showed Saturday, but still not 
as often as McElwain would’ve 
liked it to.
“One of the things we have to 
do a better job of is playing fast 
throughout the game,” he said. 
“I thought there were plays we 
looked slow. And yet, there were 

times we looked pretty fast. The 
consistency really wasn’t there, 
and where I think we can be a 
little better.”
McElwain 
mentioned 
this 
was the case for Peoples-Jones 
specifically, who made six catches 
for 38 yards. Though Peoples-
Jones wasn’t one of the many who 
fell victim to cramps in the South 
Bend heat, fatigue caught up with 
him — at least in his coach’s eyes.
“I think he played too many 
plays,” McElwain said. “That’s 
on me as far as being able to play 
fast every single down. I think 
there were times — not that he 
was loafing, but quite honestly, 
because he was gassed. We got to 

do a better job (of managing) the 
pitch count.”
That will likely lead to more 
snaps for Martin and freshman 
Ronnie Bell. After redshirting 
last year, Martin made three 
catches for 29 yards in his first 
collegiate 
appearance; 
the 
Wolverines ran two screens for 
Martin before he caught a 21-yard 
pass on Michigan’s lone offensive 
touchdown drive.
On the other hand, Bell had 
a much quicker path to the 
Wolverines’ receiving rotation. A 
former Missouri State basketball 
commit with no other Division 
I football offers, Bell committed 
to Michigan last December but 

learned enough of the offense to 
see the field against the Fighting 
Irish. 
“He did a really good job 
of 
attacking 
the 
playbook,” 
McElwain said. “The hardest 
thing for guys sometimes when 
they’re young is maintaining how 
fast they can play when their mind 
is spinning. I thought he did a 
really good job.”
Balancing the mental demands 
of the position with playing full 
speed isn’t easy. McElwain saw 
this with Collins, who took some 
time to gain his confidence despite 
being a four-star recruit. 
“I thought (he was) tentative 
early when we got here in the 

spring,” McElwain said. “As his 
confidence grew in the ‘what’ and 
the ‘how,’ he seemed to play faster 
and faster.”
Since sophomore Tarik Black 
suffered a right foot injury, the 
door opened for Collins, whose 
size and speed have become a 
talking point for Michigan players 
and coaches. He showed why 
against Notre Dame with three 
catches for 66 yards — including 
the Wolverines’ most explosive 
play of the evening: a 52-yard deep 
ball on the first snap of the third 
quarter.
“I guess I’d say his assignment 
grade was really good in this game, 
which tells me he did a good job of 

preparation,” McElwain said. “… 
Technically, he played pretty darn 
good.”
McElwain provided no update 
on Black’s injury on Wednesday, 
as he would neither confirm nor 
deny the possibility of a comeback 
this season. It’s a different group 
replacing Black than in 2017 
— Kekoa Crawford and Eddie 
McDoom have both left the 
program — and Michigan is still 
working through its receiver 
rotation. 
But though it wasn’t a perfect 
performance, Saturday showed 
that the Wolverine receivers are 
closer to answers than they’ve 
been in some time.

Harbaugh “not on the 
hot seat,” says Schlissel

Four years ago it would have 
been unfathomable to question 
Jim Harbaugh’s job security.
Even now, the prospect 
seems 
far-fetched, 
but 
after the Michigan football 
team’s loss to Notre Dame on 
Saturday, 
some 
Wolverines 
fans took to comment sections 
and social media to call for 
Harbaugh’s job.
It’s not like the entire 
fanbase has turned against the 
former Michigan quarterback. 
Even so, the contingent was 
at least large enough that 
University 
president 
Mark 
Schlissel was asked about it 
at the Detroit Economic Club 
forum at the Westin Book 
Cadillac on Wednesday.
Schlissel, 
for 
his 
part, 
scoffed at the notion.
“He is not on the hot seat,” 
Schlissel said. “He is under 
contract for four more years.”
Of course, that is easy to say 
early in the season. But even 
looking at Harbaugh’s time at 
Michigan as a whole, he still 
is the most successful coach 
the Wolverines have had in the 
last decade, even if it is by a 

small margin over Brady Hoke.
“… I joke with some of our 
coaches, who all expect to 
win a league every year and 
have a perfect record and 
the like,” Schlissel said. “It’s 
mathematically 
impossible 
for everyone to have a perfect 
record, after the first game 
anyway.”
All 
week, 
Michigan 
echoed Schlissel’s sentiment, 
downplaying the idea that 
there is any sense of urgency 
after Week 1. Each player, 
when 
asked, 
said 
they’re 
trying to block out the noise 
from the outside.
However, 
there 
is 
also 
an obvious feeling that the 
Wolverines 
must 
improve 
in short order. Harbaugh’s 
predecessor, 
Hoke, 
was 
fired after his fourth season, 
following a 5-7 campaign.
It 
would 
be 
a 
seismic 
shock if Michigan was that 
bad this season, and only a 
seemingly vocal minority is 
calling for Harbaugh’s job in 
the first place. Regardless, it 
is a good sign for the coach 
that Schlissel, the man who 
ultimately holds the power to 
fire him, has given a public 
endorsement.

Ross and Gil positive in whatever role they play

When 
Michigan’s 
defense 
trotted onto the field at Notre 
Dame Stadium on Saturday, 
junior Devin Gil came out as the 
starting WILL linebacker.
It was an answer to one of the 
final personnel questions for a 
defense returning nine starters 
from 
last 
season. 
Defensive 
coordinator Don Brown had 
said Gil and sophomore Josh 
Ross were in a “fistfight” for the 
starting spot.
Both said the competition 
benefitted them. And in the end, 
though only one of the two can 
run out for the first defensive 
play, both saw the field Saturday. 
Ross worked at MIKE linebacker 
in camp too, so when junior 
Devin Bush went down with a 
leg injury in the second quarter, 
Ross came in for him.
Gil finished the game with 
four tackles, and Ross finished 
with five.
So maybe the “fistfight” will 

go a few more rounds.
On Tuesday, at the Wolverines’ 
media availability, Gil mentioned 
Ross when asked if Bush’s injury 
changed anything for him.
“No, because I know that I’ve 
got another linebacker next to 
me, Josh Ross,” Gil said. “And 
we’re both vocal enough where 
we both can contribute halfway 
and 
he 
does 
the other half. 
So I have trust 
in him. So we 
knew that we 
were 
gonna 
step up and do 
what we had to 
do to make sure 
the defense is 
right.”
Ross and Gil 
played 
solidly, 
though the most memorable play 
from the two may have been 
one that Gil says he should have 
made.
Late in the third quarter, 
he broke into the backfield, 
nearly 
sacking 
Notre 
Dame 

quarterback Brandon Wimbush. 
But 
Wimbush 
spun 
away, 
scrambled, then found an open 
Chase Claypool for 20 yards.
It was a low point in an 
otherwise strong first start, 
which included a tackle of 
Wimbush with two minutes left 
in the game to give Michigan the 
ball back and a chance to tie it.
“I felt I did 
pretty good,” Gil 
said. 
“I 
mean, 
it’s always some 
plays that you feel 
that you could be 
able to make, and 
that’s just how it 
is.”
The 
question 
now 
is 
if 
Gil 
remains 
the 
starter at WILL.
While Ross played a lot when 
Bush went down, he also spelled 
Gil at times.
For his part, Gil says he’ll leave 
any permanent starting decision 
up to the coaches. Either way, it 
seems the two are happy to fill 

whatever role they’re given.
“We’re cool,” Gil said. “Like I 
said, we both feed off each other. 
No matter what, regardless if 
he’s in or I’m in, we’ve always 
got each other’s back, and if we 
see something that we did wrong 
or can help us, we’re gonna make 
that adjustment and help each 
other out.”
Added Ross: “I mean, having 
D. Bush and D. Gil on the team, 
I mean, all three of us just 
working together, it’s a great, 
great thing to have when you 
can really talk to guys and really 
get better off of each other. So to 
have guys like that on our team 
— linebackers next to me — it’s 
beautiful to see.”
It’s a good problem to have for 
Brown and Michigan. Bush is 
clearly the best linebacker on the 
team, and from all accounts his 
injury is minor — Gil said Bush 
practiced on Tuesday. But Gil 
and Bush both proved capable in 
Saturday night’s loss.
And they may have each other 
to thank for that.

I’ve got another

Zordich evaluates defensive back play vs. Irish

On paper, the Michigan football 
team’s defensive backs put on a 
formidable show against Notre 
Dame’s receiving corps on Saturday 
night.
But for defensive backs coach 
Mike Zordich, it all comes with an 
asterisk.
“I’d say for the first quarter, 
pretty bad,” he said of his group’s 
performance. “But after that, they 
settled in and played well.”
Fighting 
Irish 
quarterback 
Brandon Wimbush completed just 
12 of 22 passes for 170 yards and a 
touchdown. But 148 of those yards 
came in the first half, and even some 
of Zordich’s highly-touted corners 
surrendered atypical yardage.
After Chase Claypool caught 
a 16-yard first-down pass on the 
third play of the game, Notre 
Dame’s Miles Boykin corralled an 
impressive 28-yard grab through 
a pass interference call by junior 

defensive back Lavert Hill. Hill had 
his back turned and tried to save 
face by pushing Boykin, but the 
referee saw it.
For the fiery Zordich, even the 
best aren’t immune to criticism.
“The simplest things, the first 
third down — things we do 15, 20 
times in practice — we didn’t do it. 
Why? I have no idea,” Zordich said. 
“The next play (Hill) looks like he’s 
never covered a guy man-to-man. 
He had a pass interference and the 
guy made a great catch anyway. 
You just never know, just gotta 
learn from it.
“And we’re moving on, but that 
was a tough one to swallow.”
Zordich demands excellence 
from his defensive backs and will 
be blunt about it if they aren’t, but 
he will allow breathing room for 
some of the nuances of the position. 
He acknowledged the size of the 
Fighting Irish’s top two receivers 
— both 6-foot-4 — and how that 
caused a physical grudge match for 
his shorter corners.

After two consecutive miscues 
that set up Notre Dame’s first 
touchdown, he didn’t say anything 
to his group on the sidelines, 
emphasizing the short memory he 
preaches for his players.
Amnesia was certainly necessary 
after the most notable play of the 
evening, with the Wolverines 
already down, 7-0. Backup safety 
Brad Hawkins, who had replaced 
the ejected Josh Metellus, found 
himself in the endzone on a 50-50 
ball with Fighting Irish receiver 
Chris Finke. Despite Hawkins’ 
hand on the ball, Finke outmuscled 
Hawkins to bring Notre Dame’s 
lead to two scores.
“Hats off to the Notre Dame 
guy,” Zordich said. “He made the 
play. Ball is in the air you gotta go 
get it. You gotta make plays, there’s 
no excuse. Certainly that was a big 
(mistake) because that resulted in 
seven points.”
After the first two drives, 
though, Zordich was pleased. 
Michigan allowed just 22 yards the 

entire second half, and recorded 
an 
interception 
by 
Brandon 
Watson. But even Watson received 
measured feedback, as Zordich 
cited “a couple technique issues” 
before admitting the fifth-year 
senior had a solid showing on 
Saturday.
The 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
backs were some of the best in the 
country a year ago, and displayed 
that same aggressiveness despite 
anomalic mental lapses. It seemed 
like enough to hush any lingering 
concerns about the unit, but 
also enough to leave Zordich 
questioning himself after trotting 
out what he thought was an 
“unbelievably prepared” group.
“As a coach you have to focus on 
what you saw to correct,” he said. 
“Yes, you have to look at how they 
came back and they played well, 
they really did. I compliment them 
on that.
“It’s just — I’m trying to figure 
out why that happened in the first 
quarter with all the prep.”

‘M’ shows depth in win

Most 
cases 
of 
one 
team 
dominating another are a show of 
superior physicality and skill. But 
for the Michigan volleyball team, 
its 3-0 win over Valparaiso was a 
chance to flex one of its greatest 
strengths this season: depth.
In a sweep over the Crusaders, 
16 players saw time on the 
court. There were lineups that 
incorporated 
the 
Wolverines’ 
veterans and youth — putting both 
in situations to allow success.
“We want to continue to 
develop that depth,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “Because you 
never know when somebody has 
an off night or an injury or you 
want to make adjustments. That 
depth is really important for us so 
it’s kind of a combination of both 
where we’re still able to get players 
experience, but we’re also settling 
in on what our team is looking 
like.”
In contrast to last season, 
when Michigan arguably had a 
more limited bench, this year’s 
team draws its advantages from 
its substitutes. Playing freshman 
outside hitter Paige Jones in the 
more experienced starting lineup 
allows Rosen flexibility to have 
veterans come off the bench, while 
helping Jones transition to the 
level of play.
“I think (Jones) just acclimated 
to the college game really quickly,” 
Rosen said. “I think she’s a player 
who can play six rotations, and we 
certainly want her to develop as 
her career goes on.”
Rotating in off the bench, junior 
outside hitter Sydney Wetterstrom 
mans 
the 
second 
wave 
of 
substitute, playing a pivotal part in 
not just contributing to the game 
— where she hit eight kills — but 
in teaching the inexperienced 
players on the court with her. Even 
so, many of the underclassmen are 
eased into the game by playing 
next to experienced players.
“We don’t want to have a new 
player in there with a bunch of 
other new players because then 
it’s not like they get a chance to 
acclimate to what the lineup is 
like,” Rosen said. “So we try to 

sparingly put those kids in, get 
them experience with veteran 
kids, with the experienced kids. 
Because that’s a better way to learn, 
and they don’t feel that pressure in 
having to do everything.
“Also 
our 
veterans 
(senior 
libero Jenna Lerg, senior outside 
hitter Carly Skjodt, redshirt junior 
middle 
blocker 
Cori 
Crocker 
and 
senior 
setter 
Mackenzie 
Welsh), 
they’re 
really 
smart 
volleyball players, so they’re on 
the court teaching and helping (the 
inexperienced) understand what’s 
going on, so we want to give them 
the chance to play with those kids.”
Splitting defensive duties with 
Lerg, sophomore libero Jacqueline 
DiSanto saw two sets where she 
either played the main libero role 
or side-by-side in a two libero 
defensive lineup. The opportunity 
to play next to the consistent Lerg 
could be fruitful for DiSanto’s 
development.
In the center of the rotations, 
Skjodt played all three sets, 
recording 14 kills in 21 attempts. 
With all the changes in rotation, 
from 
freshmen 
to 
seniors, 
sophomores to juniors, Skjodt 
pillared the offense to work as it 
does, teaching by example.
“Carly’s just such a glue of our 
team,” Rosen said. “At the end of 
the match, she leads us in kills. She 
hits .570. She’s just a kid who gets it 
done. She’s played all six rotations. 
She’s great defensively. She’s great 
as a passer. She’s great as a server. 
There’s nothing she doesn’t do well 
we found with her. We can’t take 
her off the court. We take her off 
the court and it changes way too 
much because she’s so impactful in 
so many areas.”
One player who can attest to 
this is freshman opposite hitter 
Lizzie Sadilek, who made her 
collegiate debut Tuesday night. 
Hitting a .800 attack percentage, 
Sadilek tallied four kills, good for 
second-highest on the team for 
non-starters.
Ending Valparaiso’s six-game 
win streak while adding another 
sweep to its five-game sweep 
streak, Michigan proved that its 
strengths don’t just lie in its talents 
and skills, but with its depth that 
continues to develop every game.
