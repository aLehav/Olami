Proposal requires 
governing boards 
to open ‘informal’ 
meetings to public

By ALLANA AKHTAR 

Daily Staff Reporter

A group of Michigan state 

representatives introduced a 
proposal earlier this month 
that would require records 
belonging to governing boards 
be open for public inspection. 
Furthermore, 
the 
resolution 

would change the wording that 
requires “formal sessions” of 
governing boards be open to the 
public, to all “meetings.”

The proposed amendment to 

the state’s constitution — which 
would apply to the Universi-
ty’s Board of Regents — would 
require an agenda or specific 
statement regarding the purpose 
of all meetings be made public.

According to Ed McBroom 

(R–Vulcan), the resolution was 
developed after he and other rep-

resentatives learned that during 
an unspecified public university 
governing board meeting, almost 
all the regents phoned into the 
meeting, and nearly none were 
physically present during voting 
and public comments.

“Where do people go for the 

meeting, and how could the 
members of the board know the 
opinion of the public when they 
weren’t even here to hear the tes-
timony?” McBroom said.

McBroom said the represen-

tatives who introduced the bill 
believe accountability and trans-
parency for elected governing 
boards is essential.

“This constitutional amend-

ment will return transparency 
and 
accountability 
to 
these 

boards, and give the legislature 
the constitutional authority to 
decide when these boards can 
meet in closed session,” McB-
room wrote in an e-mail.

The resolution has been sub-

mitted to the House Committee 
on Oversight and Ethics, and must be 
approved by the House and Senate 
before being placed on a statewide 

Experts say 

universities must 
combat excessive 

drinking

By JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Though national reports may 

illustrate a correlation between 
alcohol use and sexual assault, 

recognizing the problem is just 
half the battle for universities 
trying to create a safer campus.

Antonia Abbey, a professor at 

Wayne State University who has 
been researching alcohol’s prev-
alence in sexual assault cases 
since the early 1980s, said alco-
hol plays a large role in sexual 
assault, but emphasized it is not 
the cause of sexual assault.

In 
addition, 
Abbey 
noted 

many perpetrators have multiple 
risk factors for committing sexu-

al assault — such as different atti-
tudes about women, anger and 
aggression — that contribute to 
a pre-inclination toward sexual 
assault.

“If somebody already has some 

of these risk factors and then 
they’re drinking, I think that can 
be that kind of final igniter that 
puts them over the line,” Abbey 
said. “But, it’s not like alcohol is 
going to make someone be sexu-
ally aggressive who doesn’t have 
any of those risk factors.”

Abbey said the impairments 

and questionable decision-mak-
ing alcohol can cause adds to 
the risk factors for a perpetra-
tor committing sexual assault. 
Abbey cited a research study in 
which women, after drinking, 
were randomly assigned to read 
a story that featured common 
characteristics of a date rape. 
These stories were embedded 
with risk cues, such as a man 
giving a woman a lot to drink at

Red House Imports 

coffee company 

partners with area 

non-profits

By NEALA BERKOWSKI

Daily Staff Reporter

The Detroit Beat came up with 

the business series to take a look 
at what some University alums 
were doing in the city. Whether 
these wolverines were from the 
city originally, or just studied 
here in Ann Arbor, they, like many 
alums, were drawn to Detroit and 
its start-up culture. In the series, 
we profile these UM grads and the 
small businesses that they began, 
to get a better idea of the diverse 
range of opportunities in Detroit. 
Read the rest of the series online at 
michigandaily.com.

A red house on Hamilton Road 

in Ann Arbor now serves as the 
logo of Red House Imports, a 
Detroit-based coffee company 
co-owned by University alums 
Jamie Olson and Travis Heeren, 
who graduated in 2011.

Olson said he remembers sit-

ting on the porch of the house on 
Friday afternoons, he had valuable 
conversations with his friends.

“We sort of selfishly named 

the company after the house to 
remind ourselves that you want 

to be a business that’s going to 
make the right decisions for the 
right reasons every step of the 
way,” Olson said.

Though Red House Imports 

was founded in August 2013, it 
really began in September 2014 
after more time and energy was 
put into growing the business, 
Olson said. He is currently run-
ning the company while Heeren 
is in graduate school in Vermont.

Olson said Red House Imports 

sells their coffee online on their 
website, through Door to Door 
Organics and in seven stores in 
Metro Detroit. These locations 
include Parker Street Market in 
Detroit and Ypsilanti Food Co-op.

“Our landlord from Hamil-

ton has a bed and breakfast on 
Washtenaw and she was the first 
business-to-business sale that 
we had,” he said. “So she brews 
it for her clients every morning.”

Red House Imports has a 

special focus on being environ-
mentally and economically con-
scious, while also giving back to 
the economy, Olson said.

“One of the things that is kind 

of unique is that we chose to 
start it without seeking invest-
ments because we didn’t want to 
give away from the mission of the 
business,” Olson said.

Heeren said he chose to base 

the business in Detroit because of 
his love for the city and Olson said 
he is also coming to understand 

this appreciation for the city.

“I just got back from Seattle 

and was like, ‘This is the best 
city I’ve ever been in,’ ” he said. 
“Everything 
is 
perfect 
and 

everything is functional. You can 
walk five miles straight across 
the entire city and feel totally 
comfortable the whole time. And 
then it kind of dawned on me, 
like, after living in Detroit for six 
months, I thought, ‘Well I don’t 
know if I like that.’ You want to 
be a part of something and it’s 
not always easy. And Detroiters 
have that pride, and I’m just 
starting to get that.”

Red House Imports has part-

nered with nonprofit organiza-
tions in Metro Detroit. Olson 
said he has been working with 
Hope Center, a nonprofit food 
pantry in Macomb.

“A lot of food pantries will just 

be a depressing scene of metal 
shelves, and a lot of it is empty 
so you feel like you’re getting the 
scraps,” Olson said. “You’re hav-
ing a having a subhuman experi-
ence when you’re going out and 
seeking food from people who are 
trying to help you, and so Hope 
Center has totally redesigned it. 
They’re trying to make it look like 
almost like a farmers market.”

Detroit community

Daily Staff Reporter

The outside of Ron Watters’ 

studio in Detroit doesn’t look 
like much — just a door with 
iron bars on a street scattered 
with broken glass. But through 
that door is Watters’ office, a 
white room with cement floors 
and walls covered in brightly 
colored prints and posters. He 
has a low, smooth voice and 
comes across as though he’s 
not trying to impress anyone. 
He doesn’t have to.

Through a heavy metal door, 

the space opens onto a ware-
house containing a spattering of 
abstract, artsy-looking things — 
there’s a plastic mold of a dog, a 
giant Plexiglas dome with sound 
equipment inside of it, some sort 
of science experiment involving 
melting candy and, in Watters’ 
domain, gigantic screen-printing 
machines. They look like massive 
mechanical spiders with multiple 
arms that reach out to flat metal 
feet. There are boxes on the floor 
with T-shirts and sweatshirts 
spilling out of them.

This is where Watters does 

the printing for the business he 
started, One Custom City. With 
a mission to give opportunities 
to rising printers and to help non-
profits in the city, One Custom is 
more than just a T-shirt business.

Watters went to the Uni-

versity in the late ’90s, and he 
wasn’t surprised to find there 
weren’t many Black students. 
His childhood had prepared 
him for that though. He lived 
in Detroit with his mother and 
in Grosse Pointe, one of Metro 
Detroit’s richest suburbs, with 
his father. When he attended 
Grosse Pointe South High 
School, he was one of the only 
Black students.

“You start liking girls and 

then their fathers say you can’t 
go to dances because you’re 
Black,” Watters said. “At the 
end of the day, it rounded me.”

He pursued a dual degree in 

LSA’s General Studies and the 
School of Art & Design indus-
trial design program. During 
the summer, he worked at auto-
motive plants — not because he 
needed the money, but because 
his parents encouraged him to 
see what the real world was like.

Watters said many people he 

knew from high school didn’t 
get a college degree because 
they were making such good 
money in the plants, but in 

Assembly discusses 
process of resolving 
discrimination and 
harassment issues

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

During the Senate Assem-

bly’s final meeting of the aca-
demic year Monday afternoon, 
the faculty governance body 
discussed concerns with Office 
of Institutional Equity proce-
dures, reviewed a number of 
standard practice guidelines and 
discussed the potential for fossil 
fuel divestment.

One of the primary focuses 

of the meeting was reviewing 
a report SACUA filed in March 
which detailed a number of 
concerns with OIE’s process for 
handling allegations of instances 
of discrimination against fac-
ulty or misconduct. The report’s 
central concerns focused on the 
adequacy of due process protec-
tions in OIE procedures, as well 
as how OIE’s has applied of those 
procedures in the cases of three 
faculty members who submitted 
complaints to SACUA.

At 
the 
meeting 
Monday, 

SACUA Chair Scott Masten, a 
professor of business economics 
and public policy, said SACUA 
was “pretty disappointed” with 
the written response the faculty 
governance body had received 
from University Provost Martha 
Pollack.

Her Campus grows at ‘U’

FURRY FRIE ND

Rebecca Lawson is a junior in 

the School of Information and 
has been the editor in chief of 
Her Campus publication since 
January 2014. Her Campus is 
an online publication for college 
women. 

Why did you get involved?

I had heard about Her Cam-

pus when I was a senior in high 
school. I don’t even remember 
how I happened to fall on the 
site, but I knew that whenever 
I was doing college chores and 
when I came to Michigan for 
Campus Day I always somehow 
met girls who were involved 
with Her Campus in some 
capacity. So that was something 

I knew. No matter where I 
wanted to go to school I wanted 
to be involved.

What have you done during 
your time as editor in chief 

that impacted the 

publication?

There is actually a ranking 

system at our national institute. 
The technical title for my role 
on campus is editor in chief, but 
the national organization views 
it as something called a campus 
correspondent. My job is to 
not only lead the publication 
here, but also coordinate with 
the nationals in Boston every 
week and let them know what 
we have written, what kind of 

events we have been hosting, 
who we have been interviewing 
and things like that. So there 
is a ranking system that they 
have, based on the number of 
social media giveaways, differ-
ent types of events and our traf-
fic overall. They kind of rank 
us and give us points. So when 
I came onto the staff we were a 
bronze level chapter, which was 
an accomplishment because 
more than half of the chapters 
didn’t rank at all. But under me, 
we improved to a silver level, 
and now we are actually gold 
level chapter so that’s been 
really exciting to be a part of.

Biology class 
documentary 

project explores 
genetics, society

By KATIE PENDROD

Daily Staff Reporter

Since the beginning of the 

semester, students in Biology 144 
have been creating documentary 
projects related to genomics. The 
documentaries will be uploaded 
to YouTube on Wednesday.

A branch of biotechnology, 

genomics focuses on applying 
genetics and molecular biology to 
genetic mapping and the sequenc-
ing of genes, or complete sets 
of genes known as genomes. 
The results are often compiled 
in a database and then applied 
to medicine, biology and other 
aspects of human life.

Vincent Denef, professor of 

ecology and evolutionary biology, 
said the class covers a variety of 
topics, including many facets of 
society impacted by genomics, 
such as medical treatments and 
agricultural methods. He said 
the social issues discussed in the 
class are sometimes controver-
sial, with many of the films shown 
featuring topics like employer 
discrimination based on health 
history and issues of race and 
gender.

“There’s a lot of social issues,” 

he said. “We can look at the 
sequencing and see how people 
are different and ask, ‘Are there 
different categories of people?’ 
There’s a lot of biological deter-
minism, 
there’s 
things 
that 

have gone on for a long time and 
they’ve been used sort of by both 
sides to make their argument.”

Rackham student Senay Yit-

barek, a graduate student instruc-
tor for the class, emphasized the 

importance of teaching students 
how to interpret genomic data 
and apply the information to 
other issues.

“The main thing is to make the 

connection between science and 
society,” Yitbarek said. “As teach-
ers, as people in academia, we 
do have a responsibility in tran-
scending this kind of information. 
I think for the students the main 
goal is allowing them to really 
interpret when they read a news 
article or get informed somehow 
that they can make intelligent 
decisions based on what they 
know about genomes, genes and 
some of the particular machinery 
around that.”

Denef said the documentary 

projects have allowed each group 
of students to study a topic of their 
choosing in depth — an opportu-
nity he would not otherwise have 
been able to provide from lecture.

LSA freshman Kelsey Fox said 

her project focuses on biological 
sex in relation to the definition 
of gender. Fox said interviewinga 
variety of people for the project 
has been the most signficant part 
of it.

“We interviewed a lot of stu-

dents about what they felt about 
their own gender identity and 
what they thought sex versus gen-
der meant,” Fox said. “Then we 
talked to professors and special-
ists and it was interesting to see 
how many opposing views there 
are even within a bunch of people 
who are generally in agreement.”

Both Denef and Yitbarek said 

the students received help from 
technological experts at the Dud-
erstadt Center throughout the 
semester.

“It also gave them some skills 

because there’s something inde-
pendent of this project that’s just 
being good at sort of bringing 
some information and condens-
ing it down into a visual medium. 
That is something that can benefit 
the students in whatever careers 
they go into later on,” Denef said.

Plan includes sales 
tax increase, could 

impact higher 

education funding

By EMMA KINERY and 

JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporters

After gaining approval from 

Gov. Rick Snyder’s (R) admin-
istration in January, Proposal 1 
goes before Michigan voters May 
5.

Beyond repairing Michigan’s 

roads, the proposal also aims to 
raise funds to improve the state’s 
mass transit system, increase the 
state’s Earned Income Tax Credit 
and provide additional resources 
to cities and schools, among other 
provisions.

David Waymire, spokesper-

son for Safe Roads Yes!, a special 
interest group advocating for 
Proposal 1, emphasized the pro-
posal’s importance.

“Michigan’s roads are in very 

serious disrepair,” Waymire said. 
“Some of them are dangerous, 
and the situation is getting worse 
everyday. There is insufficient 
money in the state budget to be 
able to get ahead of the deteriorat-
ing roads. This is the one and only 
proposal that has made it through 
the legislature that will help us 
repair all roads.”

The proposal aims to repair 

Michigan’s roads and other infra-
structure upgrades, but it has 
a potential to result in serious 
implications for higher educa-
tion funding as well. The proposal 
calls for an increase in the sales 
tax from 6 to 7 percent, along 
with the removal of the sales 
tax on fuel sales. Currently, fuel 
sales taxes fund schools through 
the School Aid Fund and provide 
funding to local governments.

About 20 percent of the yearly 

appropriation for public univer-
sities comes from the School Aid 
Fund. Under the proposed bill, 

public universities will no lon-
ger receive this money. How-
ever community colleges and 
K-12 education will continue to 
receive money from the fund. 
While there is potential for the 
proposal to impact University 
appropriations, public univer-
sities in the state have only 
recently been allocated funds 
from the School Aid Fund and, 
in the past, have always relied 
on the General Fund for alloca-
tions.

Waymire said while it could 

conceivably affect higher edu-
cation funding, if anything, the 
proposal will make it easier for 
institutions to draw from the 
General Fund.

“In the last couple of years, 

we’ve taken money out of the 
General Fund, when it clearly 
could be used for higher edu-
cation or other purposes, not 
to say that it would have, but 
it could have, and used it for 
roads,” Waymire said. “Passing 
this will take pressure off of the 
General Fund, and will allow 
those decisions to be made by 
the legislature.”

If approved by voters, the 

money 
from 
the 
1-percent 

increase in the sales tax would 
be put into the General Fund, 
and would be guided toward 
offsetting the eliminated state 
sales tax on fuel. Government 
officials predicted this 1-per-
cent increase would result in an 
additional $300 million per year 
for schools.

This increase is projected 

by the Senate Fiscal Agency to 
raise $2 billion in state revenue 
every year.

Many residents support the 

improvement of state roads, 
however, not all think this 
plan is the best way to go about 
it. 
Some 
believe 
increasing 

the sales tax benefits special 
interest groups and hurts low-
income residents.

Randall Thompson, a spokes-

person for the Coalition Against 
Higher 
Taxes 
and 
Special 

Interest Deals, a group against 
the enactment of Proposal 1, 
emphasized how for some, the 
1-percent increase can be a con-
siderable burden.

“A guy making $1 million a 

year — is he really going to miss 
1-percent sales tax? No, because 
he can already meet his basic 
needs,” Thompson said. “But to 
a single mom or a college stu-
dent, 1-percent sales tax? That’s 
an additional 16.7 percent (in 
tax) on every single thing you 
purchase.”

Thompson said 40 percent of 

the $2 billion that will be raised 
in revenue for the state will go 
to other projects and only $1.2 
billion will go towards fixing 
the roads.

Dave Murray, Snyder’s dep-

uty press secretary, wrote in 
an e-mail that it is improper 
for the administration to tell 
people how to vote. Rather, he 
said, state employees and the 
Safe Roads Yes! campaign can 
provide information about the 
roads and advise voters.

In addition to the roads pro-

posal, the legislature is still 
making changes to Snyder’s 
state budget proposal.

In a February interview, Rep. 

Al Pscholka (R–Benton Harbor), 
chair of the appropriations com-
mittee, said his ideal goal would 
to have a budget by May 29.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily in March, Mur-
ray said he hoped the budget 
process 
would 
conclude 
by 

June, but noted that the budget 
was far from being finalized.

Snyder announced that high-

er education will see a 2-percent 
increase in funding, but also 
said the 2015 budget had a pro-
jected shortfall of $325 million. 
The 2016 budget has a projected 
shortfall of $532 million.

To account for these short-

falls, the governor proposed 
multiple cuts to the State Police, 
the Department of Corrections 
and the Department of Commu-
nity Health.

Imports will break even.

“We always envisioned being 

able to do something at both ends 
of the supply chain, in the com-
munity and Costa Rica where we 
import from,” Olson said. “This 
was the first opportunity at such 
a low budget that we’re able to do 
something. Hope Center could 
obviously go out and get Gordon 
Food Service coffee for many dol-
lars less but the point is that this 
coffee is good enough to be in snob-
by coffee shops so you’re offering a 
great quality product in a great aes-
thetically pleasing environment.”

Olson said he also hopes to have 

a section on their website where 
customers can pay a couple extra 
dollars for their coffee and choose 
a nonprofit to donate the money 
to, which will be matched by Red 
House Imports. This would give 
these nonprofits small, consistent 
donations, rather than large, incon-
sistent lump sums, which can be 
difficult to manage.

Olson said Red House Imports 

their coffee from farmers in Costa 
Rica. The connection to Costa Rica 
was made while Heeren participat-
ed in a University Program in the 
Environment trip to Costa Rica.

“Some high-quality coffees will 

have a really distinct citrus flavor 
or something like that, but that’s not 
really what ours is,” Olson said. “It’s 
distinctly smooth and that’s what’s 
known for Costa Rican coffees.”

By 
importing 
their 
coffee 

beans already roasted, Red House 
Imports also supports their farm-
ers in Costa Rica. The company is 
able to pay the farmers $4.50 per 
pound, while the fair trade price is 
only $1.40 per pound.

The farmers also have a low 

impact on the environment by 
growing the coffee under a canopy 
of trees with high biodiversity in 
low light. This is how coffee is nat-
urally adapted to grow.

“If you’ve got more tree species 

then you’ve obviously got more 
diversity in trees, more diversity 
in food sources, more diversity in 
space, so more ecological niches 
for other species to survive,” Olson 
said. “The point is these are much 
better than a monoculture like 
where you would grow corn. It 
really doesn’t make sense to grow 
coffee in a monoculture like that 
because it doesn’t do better when 
it’s exposed to more sun.”

Olson said some other coffee 

companies intentionally deceive 
buyers by using buzzwords like 
“local roasting” to create the idea 
that they are helping the local 
economy.

However, local roasting offers 

little benefit to community because 
the coffee was still grown else-
where and that’s where a lot of the 
money goes. Local roasting also 
has a more negative environmental 
impact because unroasted beans 
are heavier than roasted beans, 
meaning the plane burns more car-
bon dioxide when flying them to 
the U.S.

Other businesses also import 

unroasted beans because they stay 

fresher for longer, so they don’t 
have to pay the farmers as much 
money, Olson said.

“We try to combat that fresh-

ness issue by having really frequent 
shipments so that we can offer it 
close to fresh,” he said. “We know 
that our farmers are great at roast-
ing and by importing it with it 
roasted already, we kind of put that 
part of the supply chain on them 
and their expenses might be higher 
but it allows us to pay them a lot 
more.”

Though running a business is 

challenging and time-consuming, 
Olson said, he likes the daily obsta-
cles and freedom to do things his 
own way.

“I like that we’re not really 

trained in it and so there’s so much 
to learn and that challenge is fun,” 
he said. “And then we can do it 
our own way. Like coming from a 
direction of this is how you’re sup-
posed to do it, we can solve how we 
think is the best way to do it. And 
it’s a learning process definitely. 
Our first cold e-mail was probably 
like a page of text. But no one will 
ever read that, so just refining that 
and getting better and better at it is 
awesome.”

Because of the hard work it 

takes to run a business, Olson said, 
he enjoys the victories.

“Friday I think I delivered 700-

some dollars in coffee and then I 
invoiced two or three stores and 
it was just like, ‘This is awesome. 
You’re actually doing this,’ so that’s 
pretty fun,” he said.

hindsight, he’s glad he didn’t do 
the same.

“My mother said, ‘This is the con-

dition that other people have to work 
in,’” he said. “‘You’ve been given 
privilege to not have to do this.’”

Just as he was preparing to gradu-

ate, Watters said, he learned he would 
have to remain at the University for 
another semester to take required 
100-level art courses. Because of 
this, Watters said he chose not to 
walk during graduation. Instead, he 
moved to Chicago to start his career, 
but he always knew he would come 
back to Detroit.

Watts started his first busi-

ness called SCIDE Design while 
he was still in college, and took 
his business with him when he 
moved to Chicago. He sold high-
end products, but found little suc-
cess in the fading market of the 
early 2000s. He tried to continue 
SCIDE Design when he returned 
to Detroit, and on a whim, start-
ing making T-shirts so his friends 
could afford something he was 
selling. That was when One Cus-
tom City began.

His first big job was for activist 

and author Grace Lee Boggs, who 
is famous for founding the Boggs 
School and Detroit Summer. Wat-

ters said he viewed Grace Lee 
Boggs as a grandmother — he was 
a part of one of the first groups of 
students to attend Detroit Sum-
mer, and grew up admiring Boggs 
and everything she stands for. He 
made Grace Lee Boggs T-shirts for 
her 92nd birthday with the slogan 
“Revolution Evolution” on them.

Today, Watters has two appren-

tices who work with him at One 
Custom City — Jovan Naves and 
Elijah Ford. One of the biggest ben-
efits of working as an apprentice, 
Naves said, is being able to work on 
his own projects on top of the work 
he does for One Custom. His line is 
called Bare All Clothing.

“Since coming to the studio, 

it’s been nothing but positives,” 
Naves said. “Working here, you 
learn a lot about hard work, dedi-
cation. Working under Ron, I’ve 
learned a lot about business.”

Since his return to Detroit, 

Watters has focused a lot on 
embedding himself in the city. 
He has taught graphic design to 
some of the city’s leaders through 
Detroit Future Media, and he 
works with local artists to help 
produce T-shirts or other goods. 
His goal is to inspire and be 
inspired, with a greater mission to 
serve Detroit’s communities.

Watters participated as an art-

ist in residency at Detroit Com-
munity High School as a part 
of the School of Art & Design’s 

Detroit Connections program.

“That’s really what my mission 

is,” Watters said. “I want to teach 
product design to kids that aren’t 
exposed to knowing where they 
can take their artistic abilities.”

The program was supposed 

to run for one month, with local 
youth who were interested in 
product design specifically.

Watters said the program itself 

was chaotic. He was put in anoth-
er classroom that accommodated 
a robotics program. Students 
were pulled randomly to come to 
the class instead of chosen based 
on skill or interest.

Watters ended up staying for 

three and a half months. He said 
the experience helped him realize 
he wants to have a space of his own 
big enough to teach Detroit students 
that they can succeed as he did.

“Usually when they have some-

body from Michigan, they don’t 
look like them, you know, it’s some 
white dude or Asian guy that will 
be teaching these classes,” Wat-
ters said. “So to have a Black guy 
from Detroit come and say, ‘Hey, 
I can do it here, I was living in 
Chicago, I was doing all this other 
stuff, I traveled all over the world 
but I picked to be in Detroit.’

In the end, Watters explained, 

Detroit needs something. He’s not 
sure what that something is or if 
he’s a part of it, but he said he’s 
sticking around to find out.

ballot and then considered again by 
both houses of the legislature.

Currently, 
the 
University 

and other state institutions are 
required to follow provisions out-
lined in the state of Michigan’s 
Open Meetings Act. The act, which 
took effect in 1977, requires public 
bodies, such as public university 
governing boards, to give notice of 
meetings, make all decisions avail-
able to the public and allow attend-
ees to record the proceedings.

“In enacting the OMA, the leg-

islature promoted a new era in 
governmental accountability and 
fostered openness in government 
to enhance responsible decision 
making,” the act states.

After the Michigan Supreme 

Court ruled in Federated Pub-
lications, Inc. v. MSU Board of 
Trustees that governing boards 
of public universities can decide 
when to hold “formal” and “infor-
mal” sessions, McBroom said 
boards began to choose which 
meetings were subject to the 
Open Meetings Act. The decision 
also allowed governing boards to 
make decisions in private with a 
voting quorum.

The Open Meetings Act also 

contains additional limitations for 
the jurisdiction of public meet-
ings. For example, the act allows 
bodies to hold closed sessions 
when negotiating collective bar-
gaining if a party requests a closed 
session. Additionally, if a can-
didate for public office requests 

their application to be confiden-
tial, representatives are allowed 
to review appointments for public 
office in a non-public setting.

The Open Meetings Act does 

not apply to “a social or chance 
gathering or conference,” though 
if the public body meets to discuss 
matters of public policy, the meet-
ing must be open.

“The OMA does not define the 

terms ‘social or chance gathering’ 
or ‘conference,’ and provides little 
direct guidance as to the precise 
scope of this exemption,” the act 
states.

Several complaints have been 

filed alleging public universities 
were violating the Open Meetings 
Act. Most recently, the Detroit Free 
Press <a href=http://www.michi-
gandaily.com/news/detroit-free-
press-sues-university-ove... 
the 

University in July, alleging that the 
Board of Regents holds most dis-
cussion and makes most decisions 
on University issues in private.

According to the Free Press, 

the regents held discussion on 
only 12 out of 116 votes held, with 
with one or more regents voting 
no on a proposal only eight times.

The 
University 
potentially 

violated the Open Meetings Act 
again in November, after the 
regents meeting was interrupted 
by a protest from the organization 
By Any Means Necessary.

The regents moved from their 

usual meeting place in the Ander-
son Room in the Michigan Union 
to the Regents Room in the Flem-
ing Administration Building. Uni-
versity officials did not publicly 
announce where the proceed-

ings would be located, signs on 
the building read “The building 
is LOCKED” and security guards 
blocked the public from entering 
the building.

University administrators said 

the meeting location changed due 
to public safety concerns. Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald 
said the University upheld provi-
sions of the Open Meetings Act 
because members of the media 
were present.

“The meeting was reconvened 

at a different location, but not 
until all members of the news 
media were present,” Fitzger-
ald said at the time. “We believe 
these steps provided for a balance 
between keeping those in atten-
dance safe while still providing 
public access.”

Regarding the current reso-

lution introduced to the state 
House, Fitzgerald said in a state-
ment: “All I can say at this point is 
that we will watch this resolution 
closely as it moves through the 
legislature.”

McBroom said because of the 

bipartisan nature of the resolu-
tion, he does not believe the reso-
lution will encounter problems 
passing through the state legisla-
ture.

“I believe that it’s very impor-

tant that the members of those 
boards and other elected bodies 
see their constituents, and are 
present and can look them in the 
eye while they give their opinions, 
and they’re not at some airport 
with the phone on mute, doing 
other things just waiting for the 
vote to come around,” he said.

OPEN MEETINGS

George Garcia, professor and 

chair of medicinal chemistry, 
said OIE’s current procedure, 
where the same person inves-
tigates and adjudicates a com-
plaint, is not proper due process.

“That is wrong,” Garcia said. 

“That is not due process. It’s a 
huge flaw in their system.”

In an interview with the 

Daily, University Provost Mar-
tha Pollack said two of the three 
faculty members who filed com-
plaints to SACUA are no longer 
employed by the University. She 
also said the University plans to 
change the way respondents are 
notified of complaints lodged 
against them. The process will 
now occur in two stages, instead 
of simultaneously.

In March, Pollack joined 

SACUA to address the report. 
During the meeting, Pollack said 
she would not discuss the three 
individual cases mentioned in 
the report and emphasized the 
importance of moving forward.

At the time, Pollack said she 

hoped to release material in May 
that would clarify how the griev-
ance hearing board will specifi-
cally address cases. She added 
that she plans to reconvene with 
SACUA on the issue by the end of 
the summer.

SACUA also provided updates 

on the University’s Standard 
Practice Guide Fitness for Duty 
policy.

In October 2014, SACUA 

began working to revise the Uni-

versity’s Fitness for Duty policy. 
The policy offers protections to 
University faculty and staff if 
they find themselves physically 
or mentally unable to perform 
their jobs, including financial 
compensation during the inves-
tigation and one-year severance 
pay if they are let go due to their 
condition.

The new policy aligns more 

closely with the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, which places 
emphasis on job performance 
and not the reason the individu-
al is unable to perform their job.

Though Masten said SACUA 

had several additional concerns, 
he added that the provost has 
made it clear that they are not 
willing to address the remaining 
issues.

SACUA 
also 
discussed 
a 

request for the consideration of a 
resolution to support the forma-
tion of an ad hoc committee to 
review the University’s invest-
ments in oil and coal.

A similar proposal was also 

introduced 
to 
Central 
Stu-

dent Government in March. If 
formed, the committee would 
research the University’s invest-
ments and use that research to 
inform recommendations to the 
University’s Board of Regents 
about whether or not the Uni-
versity should continue to invest 
in fossil fuels.

At an April 6 meeting, SACUA 

voted to present the proposal to 
the Senate Assembly.

However, not all members 

were in favor of this decision. 
Masten did not want to bring 
it to the assembly because he 

thought SACUA should not have 
a singular opinion on policy 
issues.

“There’s scope for a lot of dis-

agreement,” Masten said at the 
April 6 meeting. “I think there’s 
a huge variety of opinion.”

Masten noted a 1978 SACUA 

statement regarding the Uni-
versity’s decision to divest from 
companies that operated in 
apartheid South Africa.

The statement said the Uni-

versity should only divest in 
cases of extraordinary social 
evil and that the decision must 
express the broad position of the 
campus community.

LSA junior Nicholas Jansen, 

the director of “Global Divest-
ment Day,” wrote in an e-mail 
interview that because the Uni-
versity is such a large institu-
tion, it has a responsibility both 
to continually contribute to and 
heed scientific research.

“It is important for the fac-

ulty senate to be aware of this 
because the coal and oil com-
panies we are asking to divest 
from are on a decades-long 
misinformation campaign that 
goes against some of the very 
research that the Senate Assem-
bly puts out and goes against 
some of the very information 
that assembly members teach,” 
Jansen wrote.

Garcia said public policy 

issues like divestment from fos-
sil fuels are more important now 
than in the past.

There were not enough fac-

ulty members present to vote on 
a resolution.

a bar. Abbey said the results dis-
played alcohol’s role in missing 
cues that could warn of potential 
risks.

“Women are often not as good 

as noticing those cues or say-
ing that they would kind of have 
a plan to act on those cues,” she 
said.

However, 
she 
emphasized 

that these circumstances do not 
provide an excuse for the per-
petrator’s actions or for placing 
blame on the survivor.

“It is the acknowledgement 

that alcohol affects our ability to 
think clearly, to think well,” she 
said. “When you’re drinking, you 
may not think things through as 
clearly as when you’re sober and 
that can put you in situations 
that sometimes are dangerous.”

Abbey said in sexual assaults 

involving alcohol on college 
campuses, the perpetrator and 
the victim are often both drink-
ing. However, she said, it is hard 
to measure whether each person 
was equally intoxicated.

“It’s really hard to assess how 

intoxicated someone is, exactly,” 
she said. “It does seem that there 
are some perpetrators that will 
kind of look for somebody who is 
really fall-down drunk.”

According to a report sub-

mitted to the U.S. Department 
of Justice in 2007, 89 percent 
of 
sexual 
assault 
survivors 

reported drinking alcohol and 
82 percent said they were drunk 
at the time of the incident. The 
research report was a web-based 
survey conducted from January 
2005 to December 2007, which 
surveyed over 6,800 undergrad-
uate students.

Holly Rider-Milkovich, direc-

tor of the University’s Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center, and Mary Jo Desprez, 
director of Wolverine Wellness, 
both said alcohol is a tool, but not 
the cause of sexual assault.

“Our University is not unique 

in that we do see alcohol play a 
significant role in the majority of 
sexual assaults that are reported 
on our campus,” Rider-Milkov-

ich said.

Rider-Milkovich stressed that 

statistics on sexual assaults involv-
ing alcohol are hard to determine 
due to their underreported nature. 
However, she said she thinks 
there is a high incidence of alcohol 
involvement in sexual assault on 
college campuses.

Desprez added that universi-

ties and college students should 
challenge the idea of having an 
unlimited amount of alcohol at 
social events if it’s know to be a 
tool that can be used in sexual 
assault. She also said responsibil-
ity falls both on the people who are 
drinking and people who are host-
ing a social event. She cited “jungle 
juice,” or fruity mixed drinks, as 
a particularly significant problem 
at parties because people may not 
realize how much alcohol they are 
consuming.

“You serve some sort of a 

common source of alcohol that 
has lots of fruity flavors in it and 
people have no idea how much 
alcohol they’re having, that 
doesn’t allow people to make the 
best choice for themselves about 
what they want happening to 
them that night,” Desprez said.

Desprez said alcohol is over-

emphasized in collegiate social 
settings.

“I think the goal would be 

to right-size it, not demonize 
it,” she said. “But right-size the 
role alcohol plays because what 
that allows us to do is acknowl-
edge that we have thousands of 
students … who don’t drink for 
whatever reason.”

LSA junior Alyssa Gorenberg, 

executive vice president of the 
University’s Panhellenic Asso-
ciation, said she partnered with 
SAPAC to bring workshops relat-
ed to consent, alcohol aware-
ness and the University’s sexual 
misconduct policy to sororities. 
Gorenberg said this workshop 
was piloted with 11 out of the 
University’s 17 sororities. She 
said these workshops were facil-
itated by sorority members and a 
SAPAC volunteer.

“What we talked about in the 

workshop in terms of alcohol 
is that if you consume alcohol, 
you’re not legally allowed to give 
consent,” Gorenberg said. So, 

it was more informing girls of 
their options.”

In an e-mail to The Michigan 

Daily, LSA sophomore Chloe 
Horowitz, president of the Uni-
versity’s chapter of Kappa Alpha 
Theta sorority, said the Pan-
hellenic Council does its best 
to educate students on alcohol 
awareness and how to drink 
safely 
through 
informative 

workshops. However, Horowitz 
said not enough is being done to 
address this issue.

“I think that Theta individu-

ally, along with the whole Greek 
community, could be doing more 
to address this issue,” she wrote. 
“We could host more events to 
raise awareness on prevention, 
and just to spread the word in 
general. I would love to see 
Greek life working to make the 
campus a safer place, and I know 
we’d like to be involved in what-
ever way we can.”

Gorenberg added that the 

Office of Greek Life is commit-
ted to improving this issue on 
campus through multiple efforts 
across all four Greek councils.

“I think sexual assault will 

always be an issue until we elim-
inate it entirely,” she said. “In 
especially the Office of Greek 
Life across all four councils, 
we’re doing a lot of work to com-
bat the issue. I think we always 
want to be doing more.”

In January, University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel announced 
a student survey on sexual 
assault as a way to hear stu-
dents’ concerns on the campus 
climate. During fireside chats 
and in interviews with the Daily, 
Schlissel has identified alcohol 
abuse and sexual misconduct as 
two of the most pressing issues 
facing the campus. In Septem-
ber, the University shortened 
Welcome Week to curb unsafe 
drinking, 
and 
Schlissel 
has 

pledged to propose revisions to 
the University’s Sexual Miscon-
duct Policy by the fall.

“When you see a president say-

ing, ‘I think that (something to 
focus on),’ I think what you are 
hearing him say is we have genius 
on this campus, that we would like 
to be realized and we understand 
that alcohol harms,” Desprez said.

T

his semester has been an 
exercise in “putting myself 
out there” in terms of my 

writing. Last Sat-
urday, I read one 
of my short stories 
aloud for an audi-
ence. My whole 
family drove out 
to listen to me. I’m 
not usually one 
for public speak-
ing, so this was 
a rather big deal 
for them. My dad 
commented 
that 

he didn’t think he had heard me read 
since he and I would read “Harry 
Potter” together when I was in first 
grade. (This is not strictly true. In 
fifth grade, I read my D.A.R.E. essay 
about saying no to drugs for an audi-
ence of elementary school kids and 
a few parents. It was a truly moving 
piece, if I may say so.)

Reading my own work in front of 

people was a gratifying and terrify-
ing experience — terrifying because 
I mostly enjoy writing by virtue of it 

not being public speaking. I tend to 
be a very high-anxiety individual, so 
the terror was something I expected. 
I was surprised, however, to feel so 
truly grateful for the opportunity to 
share my writing with people who 
normally would never read it.

Writing these columns has been 

like that, too. This is the first time 
I’ve had writing of mine out in a pub-
lic space with my name attached to 
it. Like speaking in front of an audi-
ence, there’s terror in this, too. It’s 
a bit like sending your children out 
into the world to fend for themselves, 
some better equipped to do so than 
others. The ones with clearer argu-
ments can fend for themselves well 
enough, but the weaker ones don’t do 
so well. I learned this the hard way 
when my first column came out and 
the first comment on it said it was 
“disheartening” to see a newspaper 
give it space.

But I tried again, mostly because 

I didn’t have a choice. I shared my 
opinions on current events and 
then I started sharing things about 
myself. The Michigan Daily has 

been very generous in allowing me 
to share some very personal details 
about my life, and it has turned out 
to be extremely rewarding for me. 
I wrote a column about recovering 
from major depression that resulted 
in a slew of e-mails in my inbox from 
students thanking me for writing. 
It’s heartening to have your own 
experiences resonate with others — 
that’s what writing these columns 
has done for me.

The University has some really 

cool forums for self-expression if 
you’re looking out for them. Some-
times it’s public readings or stu-
dent publications, but in my four 
years here I’ve also been to all kinds 
of art shows, musical ensembles, 
stage performances and film pro-
ductions. If you haven’t taken the 
opportunity to share something 
you’ve made with others, college 
might be a good time to try it. It’s 
horrible and incredible and I highly 
 

recommend it.

ack when J. Edgar Hoover, that infallible defender of our 
constitutional rights, was playing dictator and spying on 
Americans as head of the FBI, The Michigan Daily’s editorial 

page handed out the Edgar Awards annually to individuals and 
institutions best embodying his many admirable characteristics. Of 
necessity, we revived the tradition in recent years.

And so, without further ado and the 

protection of the First Amendment on our side, 
we present the 12th Annual Edgar Awards.

The Mark Zuckerberg Award goes to 

University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald for 
issuing a press release via Facebook comment. 
At the bottom of the Daily news story 
“Investigational Equity: Student challenges 
University sexual assault policies,” Fitzgerald 
used his personal Facebook account to “add 
some information regarding two important 
points that are not clear in this detailed account 
in the Daily.” Thanks for helping out, Rick! 
Now you can add “social media proficiency” to 
your LinkedIn profile. #professional

The Fifty Shades of Grey Award goes to 

Central Student Government for once again 
tying up the election in an obnoxiously long 
litigation process. There’s nothing quite like 
public bondage. 

The Richard Simmons Award goes to 

University President Mark Schlissel for 
becoming the campus fitness figurehead. 
Multiple sources at the Daily and many 
pedestrians 
on 
South 
University 
have 

confirmed seeing The Schliss hitting the 
elliptical in the President’s house presumably 
to work on his summer bod (or to stay in shape 
— whatever). President Schlissel, let us know 
when you’re releasing the sign-up sheet to use 
your equipment … since the IM Building is no 
longer an option.

The Michigan State University Needless 

Destruction 
Award 
goes 
to 
former 

fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu and suspended 
sorority Sigma Delta Tau for their just-a-
little-over-the-top shenanigans at Treetops 
Resort during the weekend of Jan. 16. They 

only caused an estimated $430,000 in 
damages. Good work, everyone. At least there 
weren’t any couches burned!

The Hillary Clinton E-mail Scandal 

Award goes to former Athletic Director 
Dave Brandon for having “no responsive 
records” for FOIA requests for e-mails 
requested by the Daily between March 13 and 
March 14, 2014. This can only mean one thing: 
his resignation was no coincidence. Dave 
Brandon for President 2016, anybody?

The Francis J. Underwood Award goes 

to former CSG President Bobby Dishell for 
his incredibly quick rise to power during his 
tenure at the University. First a representative, 
then vice president, then president? This is 
a little too similar to our favorite politician, 
Frank Underwood. Luckily for us reporters, 
the train station is far away.

The Taylor Swift “Shake it Off” Award 

goes to LSA and Engineering junior Will 
Royster for continuing to do great things 
on campus despite losing CSG elections by a 
mere five votes. Keep dancing on your own, 
making moves as you go. Keep cruising. Don’t 
 

stop groovin’.

The Kanye West “I Am a God” Award goes 

to Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh. 
Well, this one needs no explanation.

And lastly, the Stephen M. Ross Award 

goes to Stephen M. Ross for his infatuation 
with naming things after himself. Mr. Ross, 
did you hear The Michigan Daily is launching a 
fundraising campaign? Throw us a few million 
bucks and we’ll tack your name on to our paper. 
How does The Stephen M. Ross Michigan 
Daily sound? The Michigan Ross? Take 
 

your pick!

Platelets, past and present

This was the year I gave my blood 

away. A brusque nurse pricked my 
finger and tested my hemoglobin 
count as I sat in the Michigan Union 
Ballroom. She told me that if I had 
gone to Kerala just one year later I 
wouldn’t have been able to donate. 
I lay back on a makeshift bed and 
looked away as red cells clustered 
fluidly into a bag, out of my body.

My blood comes from a place 

carefully crafted to be the perfect 
setting of a Southern Gothic novel. 
The walls of white buildings grow 
moldy seemingly overnight, and 
secrets hang like overripe mangoes 
from trees in parts of the country 
that have not yet been tamed. 
Everything is alive in Kerala, a 
state in India’s southernmost tip; 
Kerala, where backwaters run like 
veins through the state’s green, 
 

pulsing land.

Kerala, where I want, always, 

desperately, to feel at home.

Kerala is light and lush flora and 

love: love unspoken, love implicit, 
love tied to land and blood. The 
sense of belonging I have to a 
state so different than the one I 
grew up in can be explained by 
nothing else. I’m Californian; I 
grew up surrounded by mountains 
of watercolored blue and In-N-Out 
and libraries I lived in. But I’m also 
Malayali, I’m also a Keralite, and I 
know that must be part of my truth 
because that’s what my mother and 
father are. And if I’m not theirs, if 
I’m not Kerala’s, then what am I? 
Love is a tricky concept; home is a 
tricky word. Blood connects us to 
one — it draws us back to the other.

Blood is the most essential tie 

I have to my heritage, even as 
someone who has spilled little 
of it on Kerala’s soil. My blood is 
undeniably Malayali — my family 
has been for generations. I am proud 
of my bloodline, and I am proud of 
the place and people from where it 
springs. My maternal grandfather 
was in the Indian Navy; his favorite 
book is “The Count of Monte 
Cristo” and both of us swear by 
the same fierce loyalty. He left the 
Navy to become a chicken farmer, 
and the old chicken house lies a 
stone’s throw away from the home 
my brother and I stay in every time 
we visit. My grandmother roots 
for Germany during the World 
Cup for reasons I don’t understand 
and Parkinson’s has made her 
movements butterfly-quick but has 
not stolen or dulled her mind. She 
can still tell me about my mother 
as a young girl; she still cries when 
my brother and I leave to fly back 
across the Pacific.

My mother and I bear little 

physical resemblance. Our hands 
and eyes don’t look the same, 
but they gesture and widen in 
parallel when we tell a story or 
are caught up in worry. Half of my 
genetic makeup comes from her, a 
woman who came to snowy New 

Hampshire as a young bride with a 
flawless knowledge of the English 
language as her greatest asset. It is 
from my mother that I inherited a 
love of words and the storytelling 
she has made my birthright.

I carry my paternal grandmother’s 

DNA as well as her name. Teresa 
isn’t an Indian name, people often 
say to me. And then I launch into 
my well-practiced speech about 
Catholicism in India, how it’s older 
than Christianity in Europe and 
how Teresa was passed down to me 
through love and lineage. I never 
met my namesake, by all accounts 
an elegant and educated woman 
who died when my father was four 
years old.

Recently, my father said he 

wishes he had asked his father 
what had driven him to be the 
first person from his family — 
and from his village — to attend 
college. What had driven him to 
be a lawyer? What had driven him 
to become part of India’s fight for 
independence, a cause he believed 
in strongly enough to be jailed for? 
I looked at my father, a man whose 
blood and forehead and sarcasm I 
share, and I saw that what whatever 
light and drive his father possessed 
had been passed down to him as well. 
My father, who never wanted to come 
to America; my father, who is quiet 
and reserved and doesn’t protest 
when my mother’s stories are the 
only ones my family tells. My father, 
a child from a rural community who 
spent his summers in the trees. Who, 
when he was 11, decided he would 
attend one of the nation’s most 
prestigious engineering universities 
— and did. The youngest of six; an 
orphan at 21; a man whose word 
and approval carry immeasurable 
weight. He is forged of a strength I 
am still trying to attain.

Blood carries both intangible and 

tangible weight. It manifests itself 
in the way I speak, in the hard “t” I 
give the word “question,” something 
I picked up from my mother. It 
manifests itself in the clothes I wear, 
in the difficulty I have justifying my 
own short skirts and push-up bras. 
It manifests in the dreams I allow 
myself to have and the dreams I 
have put aside. Because blood can 
remember, blood can forgive — 
blood can be disappointed.

Kerala manifests itself in ways 

my cousins back in India would 
not understand — to them, I am the 
American. I am the one who can’t 
speak Malayalam and comes back 
once every two years. Coconut, 
they call me affectionately, brown 
on the outside and white within, 
and I know they love me but it still 
stings. My skin is more than a husk; 
in this country it decidedly marks 
me as other.

My mother once told me I would 

never be mistaken for a true Indian. 
The geography of my face, she 
informed me, marked me as an 

American. I didn’t know what she 
meant then; even now it’s unclear. 
How can the planes of my face 
convey anything? In America, my 
face marks me as Indian. In India, 
apparently one look at the same 
features is enough to tell people I 
don’t belong.

And so I am a mixture of an 

Indian-American face and Indian 
blood. Look into my veins, look into 
my eyes. See my blood, which, once 
spilled, would look no different 
from a born-and-bred Malayali 
or an Anglo-Saxon American. My 
blood, which tells me so much, but 
gives me no direction. The iron in 
my veins is trying to lead me due 
north, but every platelet has its own 
idea of where that may be.

Maybe I do belong in America, 

where my blood has mixed with the 
soil. Where I was born and raised 
and wore a plaid schoolgirl skirt 
more than I’ve ever worn a sari. 
Where I have loved and been loved, 
where I have hurt and been healed. 
But my blood and the weight it 
holds mean that I do not have the 
luxury of forgetting where I came 
from — even if I want to. And I 
have no interest in living in a world 
where what I do and who I am are 
not influenced and enriched by my 
love and light and blood.

A few weeks after I donated, the 

card that came from the American 
Red Cross told me that my blood 
type is O positive. I’m close to being 
a universal donor, apparently; I can 
give blood to anyone with a positive 
blood type. But I’m not a universal 
recipient — I can only draw from 
so much. I can only receive what is 
directly, intangibly mine; I can only 
take what is found in the marrow.

I have gained an immeasurable 

amount from my blood. I have 
gained strength, I have gained iron 
— I am still trying to gain belonging. 
I know what flows within me but I 
don’t yet know what — and where — 
I can claim.

But I can give blood out, and so 

maybe the point has never been 
to examine the texture and ties of 
what lies within me. I have no power 
over that, but I do have agency over 
where my blood and love go. I have 
the agency to not choose one over 
the other. And I should not have to 
choose. I should not have to pick 
A over B, India over America, any 
future over my family. I will not be 
afraid to give my love away.

I am made of tendons and 

muscles and bones. I am made of 
the scars I have gotten in America 
and the forehead I have gotten from 
my father. But, most of all, I am 
made of my heart, which pumps out 
dark fluid and vibrant feeling and 
the knowledge that the past and the 
future and the present are not tied 
to any one land or any one love.

T

wice a year, I pick up my life and move 
it 2,000 miles east or west. This will 
be the eighth time. The eighth time 

I have moved in my four years at college and 
the eighth time I have gone 
to an airport just this year.

I 
spend 
finals 
week 

splitting my time between 
packing 
up 
and 
taping 

boxes and cramming for 
my finals. My belongings 
are all labeled: “Michigan” 
or “California.” And I am 
labeled. In Michigan, I 
am the “California girl.” 
In California, I “go to 
Michigan.” I am defined by 
where I am not.

But slowly, the room that I have spent 

the last eight months turning into my home 
reverts back to its Ikea-issued bedposts and 
desk, ready for the next student to move in. 
I take my last final, return my textbooks to 
Ulrich’s and call a cab to pick me up from 
Espresso Royale. I pass out on the plane since 
I probably haven’t gotten that much sleep in 
between all-nighters for study, packing and 
hanging with friends. When I wake up, I am 
on summer vacation.

Even with so much practice, I still hate 

goodbyes. I usually have to leave so suddenly 
after my last final that I get to avoid them all 
together. But this year I can’t. This year, it 
isn’t a goodbye for a few months and I’ll see 
you when football season starts up again. 
This time it’s a real goodbye that I can’t 
schedule my way out of. My friends are all 

moving to different parts of the country, and 
this time it isn’t for internships or vacations 
for a few weeks. It’s for years at new jobs or 
 

graduate school.

As an out-of-state student, I always felt 

like my heart was in two places: half in my 
hometown and half at Michigan. There are 
things I love about California that I can’t get 
anywhere else. But I can get sick of living 
with my parents and bored of doing the 
same things I did in high school. I start to 
crave the craziness of life at the University. 
And then, after eight months here, I can’t 
wish for anything more than to be on a plane 
 

back home.

I have always been moving, rushing 

between one state and the other. But it felt like 
Michigan would always be here waiting for 
me in September. The school will stand for the 
next 200 years. Pushing open the Chemistry 
Building’s doors will still be the equivalent to 
a weight lifting workout. The Law Quad will 
still kick out undergrads at 8 p.m. Charley’s 
will still serve individual Fishbowls — “perfect 
for sharing” — to everyone at the table. But it 
won’t be my Michigan anymore. I won’t count 
pushing open the Chem Building doors as my 
workout for the day. I won’t get kicked out of 
the Law Quad and walk, defeated, to the UGLi. 
I won’t not share a Fishbowl with my friends.

Just like the rooms I vacate every May, 

someone else will move in and make it 
their sanctuary. And I will come back and 
stand outside, looking in the windows 
 

and reminisce.

‘Thrones’ opener
explores power

TV REVIEW

Characters’ roles 

shift in season 

premiere

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

“Everybody wants to know 

their future, ‘til they know their 
future,” says a witch to a young 
Cersei Lannister 
(Lena 
Headey, 

“Terminator: The 
Sarah 
Connor 

Chronicles”) 
in the opening 
sequence 
of 

“Game 
of 

Thrones” 
’s 

fifth 
season. 

Throughout 
the 

run 
of 
HBO’s 

acclaimed 
fantasy-
epic, 
there’s 

been an overriding sense of 
unpredictability, 
at 
least 
for 

those who haven’t read George 
R.R. Martin’s books. Characters 
scheme and plan but can never 
truly know what the end result 
will be. Yet there is a cyclical, 
fatalistic nature to these events – 
a character comes to power, falls 
and a void is left, and then another 
takes their place in the cycle. In 
the season premiere, “The Wars 
to Come,” most characters find 
themselves in various stages of the 
cycle with the events of last season 
still hanging over them.

Few characters can fall lower 

than Tyrion (Peter Dinklage, 
“X-Men: Days of Future Past”). 
The former Hand of the King now 
finds himself a fugitive, ready to 
drink himself into oblivion with 
no care of what lies ahead. “The 

future is shit just like the past,” he 
says between cups of wine to Varys 
(Conleth Hill, “Suits”). Dinklage 
has always been reliably excellent 
in his role, but this season finds 
him at his most downtrodden. At 
least when he was imprisoned 
last season, he had something to 
fight for. But there is hope for the 
character, as Varys points out, “I 
don’t believe in saviors. I believe 
men of talent have a part to play in 
the war to come.”

Tyrion’s sister Cersei struggles 

to come to grips with her father’s 
death. Harkening back to the 
opening flashback, Cersei knows 
some parts of her future, but 
solace can’t be found there. In a 
world of the unexpected, knowing 
one’s 
future, 
ironically, 
only 

brings dread. Cersei’s paranoid 
response to words uttered long ago 
precipitate her precarious position 
as her family stands on a knife’s 
edge in regards to their power.

Daenerys (Emilia Clarke, “Dom 

Hemingway”) sits on the throne 
of Mereen, ruling with absolute 
power. “I’m not a politician, I’m 
a queen,” she says to an adviser. 
However, her leadership shows 
cracks beneath her strong facade. 
In a stunning sequence, Daenerys 
visits her imprisoned dragons. 
Darkness surrounds her until 
pillars of flames erupt, revealing 
gigantic beasts that can no longer 
be controlled with words.

Several characters are covered 

in the premiere, establishing the 
multiple, interworking storylines 
that comprise a season of “Game 
of Thrones.” This leads to the 
episode’s biggest issue: it feels 
primarily like setup, reminding 
the viewer of where everyone is 
and hinting at what is to come. 
While the show has proven that 
it can deliver on promise, this 

premiere felt stretched a little thin. 
While the moments spent with 
each character are solid, they feel 
sometimes too short.

The most satisfying arc in the 

premiere comes with Jon Snow 
(Kit 
Harrington, 
“Pompeii”) 

dealing with Stannis Baratheon’s 
(Stephen Dillane, “Zero Dark 
Thirty”) arrival at the Wall. 
Last 
season, 
Jon’s 
storyline 

was a simplistic but effective 
war narrative with him and his 
fellow Night’s Watch brothers 
desperately defending Westeros 
from the impending Wildling 
threat. Now, with the arrival of 
Stannis, Jon must learn to play the 
game of diplomacy and political 
tact. This comes to a head when 
Stannis charges Jon to convince 
Wildling leader Mance Rayder 
(Ciarán Hinds, “Frozen”) to bend 
the knee. Faced with subjugation 
or death, Mance chooses death, 
“The freedom to make my own 
mistakes is all I’ve ever wanted,” 
he tells Jon. In regards to what 
they believe, Mance and Stannis 
are 
uncompromising 
and 
it 

creates an effective conflict for the 
episode. Stannis offers freedom to 
the Wildlings if they fight for him, 
but freedom gained this way is a 
perversion of what Mance dreamt 
for his people. Unable to see that 
happen, Mance decides the only 
thing left for him to do is die in 
protest.

“The good lords are dead 

and the rest of them monsters,” 
Brienne 
(Gwendoline 
Christie, 

“The Zero Theorem”) says as she 
sharpens a sword. There are no 
saints in “Game of Thrones” – just 
people within the cycle of power. 
Choices are made and characters 
unpredictably rise or fall, but as 
long as power exists, the circle will 
keep turning.

BOOK REVIEW
‘O’Briens’ blends 
science and drama

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Of all the trite writing adages 

tossed around, perhaps one of 
the most often repeated is to 
“write 
what 

you 
know.” 

Whether 
budding 
authors 
heed 

that 
advice 

with 
eager 

ears or scoff 
and promptly 
ignore 
it, 

Lisa Genova’s 
writing career may indicate its 
truth. After studying a P.h.D. 
in 
neuroscience 
at 
Harvard 

University and working as a 
healthcare industry consultant, 
she became … a novelist? Since 
Simon & Schuster snapped up 
rights to her debut, Genova 
has gained popularity for her 
probing insight into neurological 
diseases and their effects.

In her latest novel, “Inside the 

O’Briens,” Boston police officer 
Joe O’Brien discovers he has 
the genetic defect that causes 
Huntington’s disease. Though 
initially oblivious to the disease’s 
existence, 
Joe’s 
involuntary 

spasms and growing inability 
to 
control 
nervous-system 

functions teach him exactly what 
the degeneration of nerve cells 
wrought by this neurological 
disease entails. More painfully 
for him, he also learns how it 
hurts his family in terms of 
potential inheritance and the 
burden of caring for a terminally 
ill parent. Even though it sounds 
morbid, the family’s resilience 
makes this a story about living, 
not dying.

For those who have read 

Genova’s 
previous 
bestselling 

novel-turned-film, “Still Alice,” 
many of the themes in this 
story will seem familiar. A 
character 
initially 
diagnosed 

with the eventually fatal disease 
struggles 
to 
define 
his/her 

identity, especially once the 
symptoms escalate to the point 
where he/she cannot do their 
jobs anymore. And yet, “Inside 
the O’Briens” seems to expand 
on concepts that didn’t get much 
focus in her other work. At first, 
it comes off as repetitive. Where 
“Still Alice” settled its narrative 
focus on Alice herself, “Inside 
the O’Briens” gathers the entire 
family into the folds.

The story centers on Joe at 

first, but then breaks into parts 
that delve into his children 
and how they live their own 
lives. The children must decide 
whether to take a test to see if 
they have Huntington’s, too. 
The test itself is a simple blood 
draw, but its implications span 
much 
broader 
psychological 

effects. Once you know, what 
happens next? The solution 
requires 
individual 
courage 

and decision-making, but also 
taps into a complex interplay of 
personal relationships — how to 
proceed living and loving others 
knowing that you’ll contract a 
disease with no cure, how to 
support other family members 

dealing with their gene statuses 
regardless if your own is positive 
or negative. While Genova’s 
previous work touched upon the 
psychological aspect of chronic 
illness, only in “O’Briens” did she 
really illuminate what is a deeply 
important and engaging issue.

However, the dialect-infused 

narration 
sometimes 
verges 

on grating. Though told in the 
third person, Genova tries to 
emulate 
Joe’s 
Irish-Catholic 

police officer colloquialisms in 
more than just his dialogue by 
peppering words like “ain’t” 
and “friggen” into narration. 
Though this brings the reader 
closer to him as a character 
and allows for more intimate 
access to how his beliefs and 
goals evolve during and after his 
diagnosis, the execution often 
feels 
unnatural. 
Fortunately, 

the latter parts of the book 
bring marked improvements in 
this area, though the narrative 
distractions from the rest of 
the storyline don’t disappear 
entirely.

Still, the novel as a whole takes 

us beyond the book club. What 
Genova does best in all of her work 
is gracefully weaving scientific 
and psychological knowledge into 
her storylines. The readers learn 
facts about how Huntington’s 
is inherited and the symptoms 
it causes as they are unveiled to 
the characters themselves. It’s 
an organic means of advocacy. 
She probes deep into characters 
we can imagine meeting on the 
street, peeling back the layers 
and 
recasting 
acquaintances 

into people who we care about. 
We care about their feelings, we 
care about their fate and readers 
who may have never even heard 
of the disease before now care 
about Huntington’s.

Powerful Shakes

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

Alabama Shakes is intriguing. 

The name alone is an enigma, 
begging the question: What 
exactly 
is 

Alabama 
shaking? 
Or, 
even 

weirder, does 
Alabama have 
the 
shakes? 

Does any of 
this relate to 
milkshakes? 
(In the case 
of the latter, 
Kelis must be 
brought 
into 

the picture.) There are endless 
possibilities.

But 
what’s 
definitively 

alluring about these southern 
charmers is, you guessed it, 
the music. It remains just as 
mystifying as their name, rife 
with 
gritty 
guitars, 
soulful 

vocals and a bluesy-throwback 
aura. Lead singer and guitarist 
Brittany Howard formed the 
group back in 2009, and its first 
album, Boys & Girls, produced 
the likes of “Hang Loose” and 
“Hold On,” two of the band’s 
biggest hits to date. Its sophomore 
release, Sound & Color, takes the 
band a step further — a fitting, 
slightly modern departure from 
nostalgia-driven 
songwriting. 

Slow, experimental rock grooves 
permeate almost every tune, and 
it’s a mighty beautiful thing.

The 
title 
track, 
“Sound 

& 
Color,” 
is 
no 
exception. 

It 
combines 
the 
eerie 

irresistibleness of alt-J with 
the inherent R&B of Howard’s 
vocals — unexpected peanut 
butter and jelly. “Gemini” is 
perhaps the most avant-garde, 
with its minimalistic guitar and 
dark, otherworldly vocals. Both 
songs lend to an oddly techno 
deviation for the band, but 
Howard’s gruff timbre eases the 
transition, bringing the listener 
right back to the roots of the 
band and of good ol’ rock ‘n’ 

roll. We’ll call it southern-fried 
unconventionality.

“Don’t Wanna Fight” is a 

clear standout; it’s the musical 
interpretation of getting in a 
fight with the love of your life 
— angry, raw and repetitive, but 
still so sexy. Howard’s yawp is 
perfect for songs like this, ones 
that summon the singer to splash 
her soul onto the recording like 
an angry girlfriend splashes 
vodka on a much-too-dry, foul-
mouthin’ boyfriend. Do your 
thing, Britt.

In the vein of girl power and 

the like, “The Greatest” brings out 
refreshingly revved-up energy — 
a Ramones-esque, driving punk 
beat supports the hardest rock 
song on the album. This style 
shockingly suits Alabama Shakes. 
No worries, though, because 
Sound & Color has plenty of cool-
down melodies like “Dunes” 
and “Shoegaze” to mellow you 
out 
without 
sacrificing 
that 

signature rock aesthetic. Both 
sound like cruising around in the 
summer, windows rolled down, 
hair blowing every kind of way.

And you can actually hear 

the breeze in the background of 
“This Feeling,” a wispy, acoustic 
number that draws much from 
Van Morrison, king of chill. 
It’s a beautiful and intimately 
emotional love song, weaving a 
delicate story with patience and 
soul. This is the virginal twin to 
its lusty predecessor, “Gimme All 

Your Love,” an intensely sultry 
recording that explodes after a 
falsetto intro and never really 
calms down (lucky for us). Once 
again, Alabama Shakes proves 
they can try on any pair of jeans 
and look good. Yep, they’re those 
people.

“Guess Who” and “Future 

People” 
toy 
around 
with 

interesting harmonies and jazzy 
chords, while “Miss You” is 
perhaps the epilogue to one of 
the album’s alluded themes: one 
grand romance. Howard sings: 
“I’m gonna miss you and your 
Mickey Mouse tattoo.” (Poor 
bastard.) The song’s got amazing 
crescendos, drunken bar piano, 
lagging, traditional blues beats 
with modern touches and smoky 
guitars. It’s all too much but it’s 
all too great. And then “Over My 
Head” ends the journey with a 
surprisingly soft, slow groove. 
Howard’s mantra, “Loving so 
deeply, I’m in over my head,” 
echoes as it’s layered in different 
keys, brought up at different 
times.

Alabama Shakes seems as 

though it’s of a different time. As 
for Sound & Color? It’s a radical, 
prodigious beast of the rock/
soul/et cetera crossover breed. 
Most importantly, though, it’s 
a modern beast, and therefore 
a fearless one. Rock musicians 
ought to take note: Be bold, move 
forward. Maybe someday you’ll 
make people shake like Alabama.

FILM NOTEBOOK
A denouement to 
FilmSquad & Arts

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

“Unless 
subtitle 
reading 

makes you purple in the face, 
sprint to the box office for this 
Iranian goodness.”

That sentence is how I 

bookended my first full film 
review 
after 
joining 
this 

publication in January 2012. I 
thought I was funny, I wasn’t. 
I thought I saw the movie 
differently, I didn’t. I thought 
“sprint” was reason enough 
to ignore the rest of my shitty 
prose. I probably also thought 
getting assigned a foreign film 
signaled good things to come, 
and I’d be right but not how I 
imagined. The Michigan Daily, 
to me, actually didn’t make 
me like movies more, or like 
writing that much more, or 
like the eschewal of the serial 
comma more — it made me 
want to be a more interesting 
person.

My relationship with the 

newspaper almost invariably 
walked the tangent: skipping 
elections, skipping parties, not 
talking to the cute and cultured 
female staffers, “missing” the 
karaoke nights, the list goes on. 
I was the nine-to-five staffer: 
doing 
my 
part 
and 
never 

missing dinner. I had other 
obligations, 
other 
interests, 

other friends, I told myself, 
without any real conviction. 
And here I am, days before 
commencement, days before 
not seeing my byline anymore, 
days before when people won’t 
care one iota what I recently 
“wrote about” — and I regret 
only walking the tangent, too 
afraid, I suppose, to run into 
something I might like too 
much. It took me three years 

to realize that. Three years to 
see that my friends outside the 
Daily, for numerous reasons, 
shared less in common with me 
than I convinced myself. Three 
years to conclude that I could 
have done more. That I should 
have.

I should have, because I 

looked up to the people here. I 
didn’t look up their carriage or 
poise or sartorial profiles, but 
rather the impassioned way they 
spoke about movies. They gave a 
shit and every nerdy cinephilic 
mannerism proved it — a sniffle, 
a tremble, a not-comfortable 
pause 
when 
hammering 
a 

point. They were weird, and I 
wanted to join the ranks of this 
rarefied intelligentsia. (And by 
“rarefied,” I mean I understood 
only 25 people would read my 
“Life of Pi” review, and half of 
those would be me on various 
University computers.) Until 
then it seemed that the other 
organizations I had joined, and 
even immersed myself in, left 
me tepid, wanting, hungry for 
stimuli. And that’s what these 
Sunday afternoon meetings did 
for me: They woke me up in a 
way international trade theory 
couldn’t.

There’s 
a 
good 
moment 

in 
HBO’s 
Susan 
Sontag 

documentary when her son, 
paraphrasing 
his 
mother, 

said, “A writer is someone 
interested 
in 
everything.” 

That hit hard and it hit deep. 
It mostly made me sad, though. 
Here was a woman who made a 
living writing about thinking 
about whatever she deemed 
interesting. 
The 
boundless 

vocation, free reign, unchained 
liberty. It wasn’t sad because 
I necessarily wanted to be a 
writer, but it was sad that she 

had created for herself the best 
job in the world: One in which, 
as Socrates would’ve greenlit, 
her knowledge and virtue were 
one, her interests and desire for 
truth married. I wanted that. I 
want that. The Daily showed me 
that the written word comes in 
handy in more places than 4 and 
6A; it comes in handy in e-mails, 
texts, moleskine musings and, 
most of all, in the spoken word. 
By submitting over 70 written 
articles of some kind, over three 
and a half years, I finally learned 
how to talk. And for that I am 
eternally grateful. Sontag wrote 
about whatever she wanted, and 
I’d be hard-pressed to say The 
Daily didn’t provide me that very 
editorial freedom.

Scores 
of 
great 
writers 

look 
back 
on 
their 
college 

newspaper days with disgust 
and sardonicism, and I think I 
will too, no matter where I end 
up. My reviews were often bad, 
sometimes 
readable, 
always 

sophomoric, 
occasionally 

humorous and never perfect. 
My editors should have been 
tougher on me, kicking my ass 
a tad more, telling me in plain 
English 
that 
that 
sentence 

makes no fucking sense, that 
maybe I should start over. What 
did happen in this process was I 
began to look at words through 
a simpler lens. How can I say 
this with just enough words, 
commas, em dashes and colons 
to tell a reader — who likely 
doesn’t give a shit and just 
wants the assigned letter grade 
— that I am smart, not full of 
crap, unpretentious and maybe 
funny? The Daily didn’t teach 
me how to precisely do that. 
But the Daily taught me that I 
should at the very least try.

Thanks.

FILM REVIEW
Eerie ‘Sisterhood’

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

Teenagers running through the 

wooded night. This idea has long 
evoked images of 
a woodland back-
drop of drugs, 
sex and mischief 
that 
permeates 

the 
paranoid 

minds of wor-
ried parents. Add 
the possibility of 
a sex cult of teen 
witches, and the 
bubbling 
caul-

dron of chaos that 
erupts is “The 
Sisterhood of Night.

Born as a Kickstarter, the 

female-driven cast and production 
crew frames the story of a modern 
day Salem Witch Trials in a subur-
ban New York town in the wake of 
a massive media scandal. Started 
by the alluring Mary Warren, 
(Georgie Henley, “The Chronicles 
of Narnia”) whose name is just one 
of multiple allusions to the work 
of Michigan Daily alum Arthur 
Miller’s “The Crucible,” Mary and 
her best friends, Catherine (Willa 
Cuthrell, “Whatever Works”) and 
Lavinia, (Olivia DeJonge, “Eleven 
Thirty”) choose its members to join 

their secret bonfire-lit rituals in the 
woods. While all the girls in school 
wish to be selected for The Sister-
hood’s vow of silence, one outsider 
with a burning desire for popular-
ity and social media fame, Emily 
Parris (Kara Hayward, “Moonrise 
Kingdom”) goes to extremes to 
join them. Infuriated by the events 
of a night in the woods, Emily uses 
her blog to start rumors about The 
Sisterhood that spiral fatally out of 
control.

The film had the potential to be a 

banal dismissal of the overwrought 
feelings of teenagers, but instead it 
dives deep into genuine problems 
of today’s youth. The difficult situ-
ations of each girl’s home are made 
clear, but the real issue dealt with 
is cyberbullying. The power of the 
Internet is illustrated by the clout 
of Emily’s growing blog and The 
Sisterhood’s lack of a social media 
presence. The trade for secrecy 
over Facebook is one of the most 
shocking things to the confused 
and incompetent grown ups of the 
town as they beg the girls to tell 
them everything, an effort they 
respond to with closed lips and 
shaking heads.

Contributing to the sense of 

teenage superiority, the girls in the 
film prove to be better actors than 
the fumbling adults whose lines 

seem awkward and out of place. 
Henley gives an especially fantas-
tic performance as the fierce and 
beautiful Mary whose undeniable 
essence of cool makes it plausible 
that she could actually lead a cult.

The montages of perfectly mani-

cured suburbia are reminiscent of 
messages in films such as “The Vir-
gin Suicides” and “American Beau-
ty,” where things are not as they 
seem. First time director Caryn 
Waechter’s shots of Kingston, New 
York give an eerie sense of omi-
nous presences behind the preened 
lawns and perfect houses. Like 
their escape from social media, the 
girl’s constant forays into the night 
conveys their yearning to break out 
of the oppressive structures and 
find their real selves.

While the film deals with serious 

subject matter, its best moments dis-
play the happiness of female friend-
ship. Unlike most popular culture, it 
places equal importance on platonic 
and romantic love. Some of the best 
scenes are the celebrations and 
dances of The Sisterhood, when 
the pure joy that emanates from 
the girls puts a smile on the face 
of everyone in the audience. The 
triumphs of girl power frolic with 
the actors throughout the movie, 
with their secrets following close 
behind.

O

n the same day, Trey Burke, who 
could be a senior, is in Philadel-
phia, getting ready to play the 

76ers. Tim Hardaway Jr. is in New York, 
between two games against the Indiana 
Pacers. Darius Morris is in Brooklyn, 
where his Nets will soon host the Phoenix 
Suns.

And while on March 5 they were 

spread across the country, getting set for 
NBA games, the common thread woven 
through all of them is the same — they 
once stood on the sideline, taking instruc-
tion from LaVall Jordan.

One of the wonders of John Beilein’s 

tenure at Michigan is how the Wolver-
ines have been so successful at producing 
NBA-caliber guards.

The answer, or at least a big part of it, is 

Jordan, one of the best-kept secrets in col-
lege basketball. But Jordan doesn’t want 
the spotlight, nor does he seek it. He’d 
rather it be on his players.

That way, he can stay under the radar, 

seeing the openings no one else does.

***

Jordan likes to use the phrase “Chess, 

not checkers,” when thinking about the 
game. It’s a nice phrase to turn, but it’s also 
a window into the way he plays, watches 
and now coaches basketball.

He honed his basketball mind at Butler, 

where he played from 1998-2001. He never 
put up huge numbers or had NBA scouts 
calling, but he was a steady contributor 
during a particularly successful period in 
Bulldog history.

While he was there, Butler won three 

straight Midwestern Collegiate Confer-
ence titles and appeared in three NCAA 
Tournaments. During the stretch, Jordan 
was named All-Conference twice.

And after his stint as a player, Jordan 

moved quickly into coaching, serving as 
the Bulldogs coordinator of player opera-
tions in 2003 and becoming an assistant 
coach a year later.

He left Butler to work in the same role 

at Iowa in 2007, before ultimately being 
hired by Beilein in 2010.

And it’s no wonder he has ascended so 

quickly. He observes the floor like a chess 
master looks at a board, viewing his oppo-
nent’s move less as a threat and more as an 
opening.

“He sees things that I think a lot of 

people don’t see,” Stauskas said. “He sees 
things before they happen.”

Added sophomore guard Derrick Wal-

ton Jr.: “The game is a lot mental, but he 
takes it to another level.”

There are a few words that hold a uni-

versal meaning to Jordan’s players. He 
likes to do what he calls “bullet-point 
coaching” from the bench, shouting 
phrases meant to elicit specific responses.

Without revealing their exact mean-

ings, players know exactly what to key 
on when they hear words like “Bingo” or 
“Hostage.”

But in some cases, words or phrases are 

tailored to individual players.

“The one he used to always say to me 

was ‘one one-thousand,’ ” Stauskas said. 
“When he said ‘one one-thousand,’ it was 
pretty much him telling me I need one 
one-thousandth of a second to get a shot 
off.

“That was basically him telling me 

there’s no one out there who can stop me, 
just go out there and do you.”

But getting to the point where athletes 

buy in requires Jordan to relate to his 
players in a way many coaches don’t.

Much like Jordan finds otherwise 

unseen opportunities on the floor, he sees 
them in his players. He can take a talented 
guard with the right physical tools and 
unlock whatever it is that puts him over 
the top.

“You’ve gotta tell them your stories,” 

Jordan said. “When (they’re) going 
through good times or tough times, just 
to let them know they’re not the only 
one to go through what they’re going 
through.”

For Stauskas, unlocking his talent 

meant helping him harness the killer 
instinct he already had inside him.

He could shoot; there was never any 

doubt about that. But Stauskas’ sopho-
more year he turned into a bona fide 
threat to drive, dunk or distribute.

“Any time I was struggling, any time I 

was doubting myself, any time I was sec-
ond guessing anything, he would look at 
me and be like, ‘Nik, one one-thousand,’ 
” Stauskas said. “And I would just go out 
there and just play.”

Sometimes, it can be as simple as a 

verbal reminder. In other cases, it takes a 
long-term effort. But no matter what it is, 
Jordan almost always sees his guards turn 
into standouts, breaking through the ceil-
ing they once thought limited them.

Stauskas was called “just a shooter” his 

freshman season, but turned into the Big 
Ten Player of the Year as a sophomore. 
Sophomore guard Zak Irvin had a similar 
label until he won the team’s Loy Vaught 
rebounding award this year. Junior guard 
Spike Albrecht was supposed to be a bench 
player — more of a feel-good story than 
someone to game plan around — but aver-
aged over 30 minutes per game this season 

and shared the Wolverines’ MVP 

award with Irvin.

“Watching them grow, that’s the fun 

part,” Jordan said. “Watching them think 
and understand the game at a higher 
level, because it is a thinking man’s game. 
You’ve gotta be athletic and have the skill 
and all of that, but you also have to have 
the understanding and the IQ and an acu-
men where you can be a little ahead of the 
play.”

***

In 2000, Jordan’s junior year of col-

lege, his Butler team was leading Florida 
in the first round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment by one point. With less than 10 sec-
onds left, Jordan missed two free throws, 
giving Florida a chance to bring the ball 
down the court for a late win.

Mike Miller hoisted up a two-point 

jumper, and Jordan went for a block, 
sprinting in from behind. His fingers 
missed the top of the ball by mere centi-
meters.

The shot dropped.
“I thought I had it,” Jordan said, 

chuckling all these years later. “And our 
point guard tried to take a charge.”

But he has never told any of his play-

ers that story. At least not that he can 
remember.

“Maybe if they bring it up, or if one 

of them has a similar experience,” Jor-
dan said. “I’ve had guys miss what’s 
perceived to be a game-winning shot, or 
maybe a big free throw or two, and you 
just have a testimony you can share that 
it’s not the end of the world. It happens.”

But rather than tell them, he has done 

his teams one better. His attention to 
detail and game preparation have kept 
Michigan from suffering the same fates 
time and again.

In 2013, before Michigan’s game 

against Kansas in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, Jordan had a particularly difficult 

problem to solve. The Wolverines relied 
heavily on pick-and-rolls in their offense, 
but then-sophomore Trey Burke and 
then-freshman Mitch McGary appeared 
to be mismatched against Kansas center 
Jeff Withey.

So Jordan turned where he often finds 

himself turning when he wants to see 
great guard play — Chris Paul.

An admirer of Paul’s backcourt art-

istry, Jordan encourages players to watch 
film of Paul and how he handles different 
situations. Usually, he watches it with 
them.

So when he was game planning for 

Withey, Jordan knew that Paul’s game 
film could have the answer to his prob-
lem. As then-senior Josh Bartelstein 
remembers it, Jordan queued up clips 
of Paul running pick-and-rolls against 
tall centers who contested shots, and he 
crafted an attack based on those.

“They would drop the big, and, for 

Trey, he’s not going to really be able to 
finish on a 7-footer like that,” Bartel-
stein said. “So many coaches you hear 
say, ‘When you pass the ball, don’t jump.’ 
Cause that leaves you with no options.’

“Chris Paul would be great at throw-

ing lobs to DeAndre Jordan, they called 
them ‘Lob City.’ Against (Kansas), we 
practiced all week, Trey going up to 
shoot, and at the last second instead of 
shooting it, throwing up a lob to Mitch. If 
you go watch the highlights of the Kansas 
game, Mitch probably had 10 points off 
just straight pick-and-rolls where Trey 
would go up to shoot, and Jeff Withey 
would go up to block him, and Trey 
would lob it to Mitch and Mitch would 
lay it in.”

McGary had 25 points on 12-of-17 

shooting in that game. He might have 
never even taken that many shots without 
Burke’s lob passes to get around Withey.

That’s 
the 
move 
of 
a 
chess 

master. Jordan can find a weakness and 
quickly figure out how to exploit it, even 
if it means doing something conventional 
wisdom would prohibit.

“Val is a champ at giving me differ-

ent options,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein at last week’s team Award Cer-
emony. “He looks at it a bit different per-
spective. He’s definitely not a yes man.”

In his five completed seasons with the 

team, Jordan’s impact was perhaps never 
more important than 2014-15.

The Wolverines lost their entire start-

ing backcourt — Walton and junior guard 
Caris LeVert — to injury midway through 
the season. For most teams, and most 
backcourts, that would’ve meant a com-
plete collapse.

But for Michigan, which had Wal-

ton and LeVert as the centerpieces of its 
offense, it meant a completely new start-
ing backcourt stepping in and, somehow, 
remaining the focal point of the offense.

And as the season wore on, it was Irvin 

— a guard-turned-forward who previ-
ously spent extensive time working with 
Jordan — leading the charge.

After LeVert and Walton went down, 

the team didn’t have a go-to scorer, and 
Albrecht was its only proven distributor. 
Seemingly out of nowhere, Irvin came 
alive in the final few games and delivered 
polished, determined performances both 
passing and shooting the ball, sparking 
the Wolverines late in the year.

“(LeVert and Walton) were second and 

third (on the team) in assists, and they 
didn’t play half the year,” Beilein said. 
“So passing was a big issue for us this 
year, and all of the sudden, Zak Irvin’s 
dropping dimes, like five a game down 
the stretch? Big.”

But it wasn’t so sudden when you think 

of the context. Irvin had been work-
ing with Jordan for two years, trying to 
locate the spark that would round out his 
game and push him over the edge.

It just finally paid off.
“Coach Val — he’s incredible,” Albrecht 

said after the Wolverines thumped Illi-
nois in the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament. “Best point guards coach in 
the country.”

While Stauskas talks on the phone 

from Orlando in March, he’s at a bit of a 
crossroads. His NBA career didn’t start 
as hot as he might have hoped.

Over the first half of the season, he 

averaged less than four points per game. 
He played under three separate head 
coaches and had to battle with Ben 
McLemore for playing time. But Stauskas 
came on strong late, nearly doubling his 
first half scoring average after the All-
Star Break.

There are flashes of the greatness he 

showed off his sophomore season — the 
greatness Jordan helped him and so 
many others harness.

But even still, Stauskas hasn’t yet found 

the type of success he had at Michigan.

No one reminds him to embrace his 

killer instinct. No one tells him, “one one-
thousand.”

“I’ve kind of forgotten it this year,” 

Stauskas says. “It might be good for me to 
kind of remember that.”

THE GUARD WHISPERER

LaVall Jordan helps Wolverines harness untapped potential

After successful playing career, 

Michigan assistant uses wisdom to 

inspire, motivate

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Nik Stauskas remembers it clearly. The game. 

The play. The trap. But mostly, he remembers the 
timeout.

It was his sophomore year, and Michigan was 

playing Minnesota. Normally able to create his 
own shot off a ball screen, Stauskas was struggling 
to get open.

Frustrated, he went to the sideline during a 

timeout, where Michigan assistant coach LaVall 
Jordan was waiting with the answer Stauskas 
didn’t even know he was looking for.

“I remember going to the timeout and he was 

like, ‘Reject the ball screen. Just fake middle, 
go baseline and you’re gonna have a wide-open 
layup,’ ” Stauskas recalls Jordan telling him. “I 
was like, ‘Alright, whatever.’ ”

When he went back in, Stauskas did exactly 

what Jordan told him to. Jordan Morgan passed 
him the ball and rotated over for a screen. But as 
Minnesota’s Daquien McNeil started to cheat the 
screen, Stauskas blew past him, finishing a layup 
at the rim. He finished with a game-high 21 points.

“I looked back to him, and he was like, ‘I told 

you so!’ ” Stauskas said.

Stauskas could have been a junior this season, 

and as he recalls the moment, he could be getting 
ready for a trip to Northwestern. Instead, he’s 
talking on the phone in Orlando, where his 
Sacramento Kings are preparing to play the Magic.

The outfielders are all shaded 

in, as is typical when the slap 
hitting Abby Ramirez enters the 
batter’s box. She takes two pitches 
and hits the next one farther 
than any other in her two-year 
collegiate career. The Rutgers 
outfielders take a few steps back, 
but it’s no use. The ball is already 
over the right-field wall.

Ramirez had just hit her first 

home run as a Wolverine. And at 
the same time, she proved why 
she is one of the most dangerous 
slap hitters in the nation.

Ramirez, who is batting .375, is 

often overlooked when opponents 
prepare 
for 

the 
Michigan 

softball team’s 
lineup. With a 
team that boasts 
some of the top 
hitters in the 
conference such 
as junior second 
baseman Sierra 
Romero, junior 
centerfielder 
Sierra 
Lawrence, 
junior 
right 

fielder 
Kelsey 

Susalla and sophomore left fielder 
Kelly Christner, it’s natural that 
Ramirez is not in the forefront of 
opposing pitchers’ minds.

She’s not at the forefront of 

the lineup, either, batting ninth. 
But that’s right where Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins wants her.

“She’s a great person to have 

come 
up 
with 
(Lawrence), 

(Romero), and Christner (on 
deck),” Hutchins said. “You want 
one of your better hitters in the 
nine hole to bring around for the 
top of the order.”

Ramirez 
has 
the 
fifth-

best batting average on the 
team, 
right 
behind 
Romero, 

Christner, Lawrence and Susalla, 
respectively. Her role at the 
bottom of the order is crucial, 
setting the table to both start and 
continue rallies.

The only slap hitter in the 

lineup, Ramirez brings versatility 
to the team. Instead of standing 
still in the batter’s box like the 
rest of her teammates, she gets 
a running start before she hits 
the ball. And with Ramirez’s 
quickness, the extra few steps out 
of the box make it even harder to 
get her out. This ability to get on 
base frequently is what stood out 
to Hutchins when Ramirez was in 
high school.

“She was a 

slapper 
when 

we 
got 
her,” 

Hutchins said. 
“You 
don’t 

only 
recently 

learn to slap, 
but that’s what 
caught 
my 

eye 
when 
I 

recruited 
her. 

I watched her 
play, and she was always on base 
and made tons of things happen 
from the left side.”

But Ramirez wasn’t always 

exclusively a left-handed slap 
hitter. In high school she was 
a switch-hitter known for her 
power hitting, setting an Illinois 
Class 4A record for home runs 
in a season with 20. This is why 

Hutchins wasn’t surprised when 
Ramirez blasted her first home 
run against the Scarlet Knights.

During her freshman year, 

Hutchins worked with Ramirez 

on her hitting 
from 
both 

sides 
of 
the 

plate. 
They 

also worked on 
both power and 
slap 
hitting, 

but 
with 

neither 
being 

consistent, they 
decided to go 
with the latter, 
with Ramirez 

batting lefty.

“I prefer whatever is working,” 

Ramirez said. “Before I started 
doing both and it wasn’t really 
working that well for me, so I 
decided to take one and focus on 
one so I could get that the best 
I could. Maybe down the road 
when I get better at lefty, I could 
start switching again. It just kind 

of depends on how I do.”

By picking one and sticking 

with it, Ramirez came into her 
own.

After batting a respectable 

.289 in her freshman campaign, 
Ramirez 
has 
gained 
more 

confidence and composure at the 
plate in her sophomore season — 
her primary goal ever since the 
season began.

“Recently, 
I’ve 
just 
been 

trying to stay loose and I have 
more confidence,” Ramirez said. 
“When I start to struggle, I start 
doubting myself. So it’s just going 
up there and not carrying my past 
at-bats into it.”

Added Hutchins: “She’s so 

even-keel. 
She’s 
consistent 

whether she’s having a good day 
or bad day and she always works 
at her game. She just stays within 
herself and doesn’t have too much 
expectation out of herself. Her 
consistency is fantastic.”

And 
with 
Ramirez’s 

consistency, defenses have no 

idea how to play against her.

In the next game against 

Rutgers — a day after the game 
in which she hit her first home 
run — Ramirez smacked another 
homer over the wall. Even after 
that, opponents still continued to 
play their outfield in when she is 
up to bat. In last weekend’s series 
against Indiana, Ramirez hit 
another ball over an outfielder’s 
head, this time for a double. It 
would have been a routine play if 
the outfield was at normal depth.

Ramirez is an integral part 

of the Wolverine offense, and 
she shouldn’t be underrated or 
overlooked by opponents any 
longer. When No. 4 Michigan 
(14-2 Big Ten, 41-6 overall) plays 
Michigan State (1-15, 16-29) on 
Tuesday, she’ll strive to do what 
the best slap hitters do — keep the 
defense on its toes.

“I like to have a slapper in the 

lineup,” Hutchins said. “Then 
there’s a lot more things that can 
happen.”

Slap-happy Ramirez keeps defenses guessing

LeVert will announce 
future plans Tuesday

Caris LeVert will announce 

his NBA Draft decision Tuesday, 
according to a representative of the 
Order of Angell, a campus honor 
society from which LeVert has 
accepted a membership invitation 
for the 2015-16 academic year.

LSA 
senior 
Natasha 

Dabrowski, a member of the 
Order, sent the Daily a full list of 
the organization’s 22 incoming 
members earlier Monday evening. 
She later indicated via text 

message that the announcement 
regarding LeVert’s future plans 
was slated for Tuesday.

Dabrowski 
told 
the 
Daily 

on Monday night that while 
LeVert accepted the Order of 
Angell’s invitation to join, his 
current status as a member of the 
organization has no bearing on 
his decision.

When 
contacted 
Monday 

evening, a team spokesman could 
not confirm that an announcement 
was planned for Tuesday.

At the program’s annual awards 

banquet on April 15, LeVert 
revealed that he had submitted a 
second request for evaluation from 
the NBA Undergraduate Advisory 
Committee to determine where 
in the draft he would likely be 
selected.

“I don’t think it really makes 

sense to go early and be drafted in 
the second round,” LeVert said at 
the event.

LeVert sustained a season-

ending foot injury at the tail end 
of Michigan’s 56-54 win over 
Northwestern on Jan. 17. Prior to 
his injury, he averaged 14.9 points, 
4.9 rebounds, 3.7 assists and a 
team-high 35.8 minutes per game.

The 6-foot-7 guard had surgery 

in May 2014 after suffering 
a stress fracture on the same 
foot. He missed early-summer 
workouts prior to the 2014-15 
season but played during the 
team’s August trip to Italy.
