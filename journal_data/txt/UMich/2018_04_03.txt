SAN ANTONIO, Texas — Jordan 
Poole sat with a towel over his 
head, eyes red with tears. Duncan 
Robinson stood next to him, his 
voice barely audible. Isaiah Livers 
was down a ways, isolated from the 
rest of his team. Charles Matthews 
and Zavier Simpson sat deep in their 
lockers.
All 
of 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
players 
answered 
questions about the 79-62 drubbing 
they’d just taken from Villanova in 
the NCAA Championship game. The 
Wolverines’ answers varied from 
regret to pride for the tournament 
run to love for their teammates.
But one thing that was consistent 
was the struggle for an explanation of 

what just happened. Villanova made 
all the right plays all night long, and 
Michigan was rendered completely 
helpless.
“We lost to a team that was better 
than us tonight,” said Wolverines 
coach John Beilein. “And we were 
telling our kids, ‘We’ve just gotta be 
better than them one night.’ Because 
they are talented and have incredible 
experience. But we didn’t have it, and 
they did.”
Every time Michigan did start a 
semblance of a run, it was answered 
immediately.
With just under seven minutes 
left and the Wolverines trailing by 14, 
Poole forced a turnover and sprinted 
into the frontcourt. He slipped into 
the lane and rose up through traffic 
but missed the contested layup 
wildly off the backboard.

Moments later, the Wildcats’ 
Mikal Bridges came the other way 
and drilled a three with a hand in his 
face.
It was a play that made Beilein 
shake his head in disbelief when he 
talked about it after the game. And 
the play started a run that crushed 
Michigan’s hope once and for all.
“We talk big about chopping the 
tree down,” Livers said, referencing 
the metaphor the Wolverines use 
to talk about making a comeback. 
“You can’t chop a tree down when 
you chop it one time and then on 
the next time down they hit a big 
shot. Especially, I think there was a 
spurt when (Villanova guard Donte 
DiVincenzo) hit two or three of 
them in a row, and one was a lay-up 
or something like that. And when a 
guy’s going like that, it’s just tough on 

a team.”
Livers was right. DiVincenzo 
hit everything he looked at for the 
Wildcats. He hit and-one layups 
and pull-up threes and two-handed 
dunks en route to an 18-point first 
half and a 31-point game.
“(It’s) frustrating as heck, because 
you play good defense on the guy,” 
Livers said. “… So you’ve gotta do 
your best to alter his shot and get in 
his way, but every time we tried to do 
that he just adjusted.”
Entering the game, it seemed 
like Michigan would need a perfect 
storm to win anyway. Villanova had 
to have an off night shooting, Jalen 
Brunson would have to have an off 
night all around, and the Wolverines 
would need to be clicking offensively.
In the beginning of the first half, 
that seemed to be taking shape. After 

making his first two shots of the 
game, Brunson missed his next four. 
The Wildcats missed their first four 
threes. Wagner had 11 points and 
Michigan sprung out to a seven-point 
lead with just under 11 minutes left.
That’s when DiVincenzo, the Big 
East Sixth Man of the Year, went off.
After leading for most of the first 
half, the Wolverines were caught 
in a whirlwind. They missed 14 
of their 18 shots after taking that 
seven-point lead. That, combined 
with DiVincenzo’s explosion, erased 
Michigan’s promising start. The 
Wildcats led, 37-28, at the break.
The run to end the half was a 
precursor of what was to come.
“They’re 
really 
talented 
top 
to bottom and experienced, and 
they’ve played on this stage before,” 
Robinson said. “Not that that’s any 

sort of excuse, because we feel like 
we could have played better, but 
tonight they were just a lot better 
than us clearly.”
The Wolverines exited the court 
at the Alamodome with confetti 
cascading around them, like they 
had in Los Angeles and New York. 
But it wasn’t for them this time. The 
Big Ten Tournament Championship 
and the NCAA West Regional 
Championship didn’t mean anything 
in that moment.
Because 
on 
Monday 
night, 
Michigan ran into a buzzsaw that 
it had no hope of stopping. The 
Wolverines were outgunned and 
outmanned in the final game of the 
season, and now it was all over.
Villanova won its second NCAA 
Championship in three years, and 
Michigan was helpless in stopping it.

The 
U.S. 
Commerce 
Department 
announced 
on 
March 26 the 2020 census 
will include a question asking 
respondents whether they are 
U.S. citizens. Made during 
a heated national debate on 
immigration policy, the decision 
has raised significant questions 
about potential effects of the 
change at the University of 
Michigan.
According to a statement 
released by the department, the 
decision will help gain more 
accurate 
information 
about 
eligible 
voter 
demographics 
and will assist the Department 
of Justice and the judiciary 
with enforcing Section 2 of 
the Voting Rights Act, which 
protects minority rights.
However, opponents of the 
decision argue the question will 
disincentivize 
undocumented 
immigrants from filing census 
data. According to the Pew 
Research Center, there were 

11 
million 
undocumented 
immigrants 
in 
the 
United 
States in 2015, making up 3.4 
percent of the total population. 
If a significant portion of these 
people choose not to respond 
to the census, the survey 
would deliver an inaccurate 
population count and distort 
the demographic makeup of the 
U.S.
Numerous 
government 
agencies and outside groups rely 
on the information gathered 
in the census, which is carried 
out every 10 years, for accurate 
population data. Changes that 
could impact its accuracy are 
subject to scrutiny. In this case, 
immigration advocacy groups 
are concerned the addition 
of the question will lead to 
inadequate attention to ethnic 
minorities and immigrants in 
government work.
New York Attorney General 
Eric T. Schneiderman, one 
of President Donald Trump’s 
most active opponents among 
state attorneys general, plans 
to file a multi-state lawsuit 
challenging 
the 
decision. 

California 
Attorney 
General 
Xavier Becerra filed a separate 
lawsuit on March 26.
William 
Lopez, 
a 
postdoctoral 
fellow 
in 
the 
School of Social Work working 
with 
immigration 
research, 
said he believes the question 
will have a significant impact 
on the results of the census 
and the nature of government 
immigration 
policy 
could 
contribute to this effect.
“Having 
a 
citizenship 
question on the census is going 
to disincentivize anyone from 
taking the census who is not 
a citizen,” Lopez said. “The 
reason for this largely is we take 
the census — we are counted 
by our government — in order 
to receive the resources which 
should be equitably directed to 
us. The issue for undocumented 
folks is that they are well aware 
of the government resources 
that are directed to them. 
And that is Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement, border 
patrol 
and 
targeting 
their 
removal. So there’s no incentive 
to categorize yourself in a group 

the government is currently 
pursuing.”
The 
question 
does 
not 
inquire 
about 
the 
legality 
of a respondent’s residence, 
and many legal residents are 
not U.S. citizens. However, 
Lopez claims the presence 
of the question would likely 
impact responses. Lopez also 
said 
Trump’s 
generalized 
immigration 
rhetoric 
could 
discourage even legal residents 
from 
responding, 
including 
immigrants protected under the 
Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals program, which grants 
legal status to minors brought 
into the country illegally.
“On a larger political scale, 
Trump is not differentiating 
people who are undocumented 
versus DACA versus permanent 
resident versus in the process 
of getting documented,” Lopez 
said. 
“He’s 
just 
throwing 
all immigrants in the same 
category, legally or otherwise 
… If you’re not identifying 
yourself as a citizen, you’re 
identifying yourself as someone 

Talking on their experiences 
as queer, practicing members of 
their respective religions, a panel 
of speakers Monday night covered 
discussions about what it means 
to be an LGBTQ+ person and a 
person of faith, and considered 
the harm or ignorance people 
may face in either community. 
Though the speakers at the 
event — hosted by the Spectrum 
Center at the University of 
Michigan — came from an array 
of 
religious 
backgrounds, 
a 
shared sentiment many of them 
expressed was the reconciliation 
of 
their 
different 
identities. 
Reverend Matthew Lukens, a 
chaplain at Canterbury House, 
recalled being raised in a fairly 
conservative environment as a 
Southern Baptist in Alabama. 
He talked of the difficulty he 
had in bringing together his 
appreciation of the church and 

his gay identity.
“I was really involved in my 
church and I loved it,” Lukens 
said. “It was a great community 
for me. It was just a way that 
really defined how I moved 
through the world. Realizing that 
I was gay completely pulled the 
rug out from me as a person. I had 
to spend a lot of time putting back 
together how I fit myself into the 
world.”
Merton Spencer, a member 
of the Lord of Light Lutheran 
ministry 
on 
campus, 
echoed 
Lukens’s 
sentiment, 
saying 
sometimes one identity would 
take precedence over the other.
“At times, my gay identity 
would be more evident in the 
way I was living my life, and my 
thoughts, and my feelings and 
how I handle that as a person 
of integrity also,” Spencer said. 
“And sometimes my identity as 
a Christian would become more 
prominent and impactful on my 
life. Those would sometimes go

that our president in power has 
targeted for, at the very least, 

anti-immigrant rhetoric but also 
for deportation and removal.”
Student 
advocacy 
groups 
have 
responded 
negatively 
to the decision. Engineering 
senior Javier Contreras has 

been involved in immigration 
advocacy 
for 
five 
years 
at 
 
three 
different 
schools. 
He 
began 
his 
work 
in 
a 
 
mentorship 
program 
in 
his 
senior year of high school, 
helping 
students 
find 
colleges with resources for 
undocumented 
students. 
Contreras 
is 
a 
DACA 
recipient and has focused 
his 
recent 
advocacy 
on 
protecting 
undocumented 
University students.
“Generally, 
we’re 
not 
going to have a proper 
portrayal of our presence,” 
Contreras 
said. 
“The 
numbers would lie and be 
skewed to say that we have 
a smaller presence (than we 
do).”
Contreras noted DACA 
applicants 
are 
required 
to provide a large amount 
of 
personal 
information, 
including 
past 
addresses 
and fingerprints, but usually 
find the benefits outweigh 
concerns about the use of 
that information. He claims 
the same would not be true 
for the census. Contreras 
also said information and 
language 
barriers 
could 
stoke more fear and lead 
to an even lower amount of 
responses from immigrants.
LSA 
senior 
Alejandro 

Navarrete works at the Student 
Community 
of 
Progressive 
Empowerment, which supports 
and 
serves 
undocumented 
students. Like Contreras, he has 
been working in immigration 
advocacy 
for 
his 
entire 
undergraduate career.
“The usability of the census 
for 
any 
type 
of 
empirical 
research 
would 
also 
be 
impacted, 
which 
would 
 
pretty much make the census 
useless, especially given the high 
proportion of undocumented 
immigrants that live in the 
country,” Navarrete said.
Navarrete said undocumented 
University students will not be 
in immediate trouble, and other 
issues are far more pressing for 
undocumented 
immigrants. 
However, he expressed concerns 
about the long-term effects of an 
inaccurate population count, 
which could potentially hurt 
the immigrant population as a 
whole.
“When drafting policy — 
thinking about who constituents 
are 
— 
representatives 
will 
underestimate 
the 
number 
of 
immigrants 
and 
also 
underestimate the effect of 
immigrants,” Navarrete said. 
“In the long term, it will just be a 
negative for any progress related 
to the estimate of immigration’s 
impact on the country.”

CENSUS
From Page 1

On Monday evening, current 
and 
incoming 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Central 
Student 
Government 
leadership 
released a statement of support 
for the Lecturers’ Employee 
Organization. 
The 
statement 
encourages students to engage 
in 
LEO 
bargaining 
efforts 
and support lecturers at the 
University.
Since 
last 
October, 
LEO 
has been bargaining with the 

University for increased wages 
and benefits. According to the 
statement, LEO is comprised of 
1,700 non-tenure track faculty 
across all three campuses, and 
in the 2016-2017 school year 
generated $462 million for the 
University. Lecturers’ contracts 
are set to expire on April 20, 
and while the administration 
had initially responded to LEO’s 
requests with a proposition, 
LEO referred to their proposal 
as “insulting.” If the University 
does not properly comply with 
LEO’s 
demands, 
they 
have 
authorized a possible vote for a 

strike.
The joint CSG statement, 
signed by current CSG President 
Anushka Sarker, an LSA senior 
and CSG Vice President Nadine 
Jawad, a Public Policy senior, and 
incoming CSG President Daniel 
Greene, a Public Policy junior, 
and CSG Vice President Izzy 
Baer, an LSA sophomore, called 
for students to stand in solidarity 
with LEO. The CSG leadership 
also acknowledged the hardships 
lecturers at the University face 
due to low salaries.
“When 
our 
lecturers 
are 
forced to work multiple jobs, 

face 
food 
insecurity, 
and 
struggle to make ends meet 
in Ann Arbor, we as students 
feel the repercussions through 
the quality of teaching in our 
classrooms,” the statement read. 
“Lecturers’ working conditions 
are our learning conditions.”
CSG 
leadership 
also 
encouraged 
students 
to 
participate in the LEO Weekend 
of Action, which will take place 
from April 6 through April 10, 
and will include open bargaining 
sessions and a potential strike if 
LEO demands are not properly 
acknowledged.

New rules revoke zoning for chapters who lose University recognition, $4.2 million purchase also discussed

In Monday night’s meeting, 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 
amended housing ordinances 
for fraternities and sororities 
in Ann Arbor and a $4.2 million 
empty lot repurchase.
The 
council 
passed 
an 
ordinance on the Ann Arbor 
housing code to modify the 
definition 
of 
fraternity 
or 
sorority housing in Ann Arbor 
and to amend special exception 
use standards.
The ordinance will not allow 
any fraternities or sororities 
that are not sanctioned by 
a university — namely the 
University 
of 
Michigan. 
As 

a result, if a fraternity loses 
its recognition, that property 
would have to be replaced by a 
recognized group or the zoning 
will be revoked. The council’s 
ordinance 
comes 
after 
the 
Interfraternity Council imposed 
a ban on social activities due 
to several incidents of hazing 
and sexual assault. The ban 
was lifted at the beginning of 
the winter semester, but even 
after the ban was lifted, one 
fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau, had 
their charter revoked due to 
sexual assault allegations.
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, said the 
ordinance is another step in 
discouraging rape culture on 
campus.
“It’s another tool to curb the 

culture of sexual assault and 
hazing,” Ackerman said.
Furthermore, 
with 
new 
“special 
exception 
use” 
standards the ordinance will 
further control the density and 
population of the houses. Under 
this new ordinance, the initial 
special exception use standard 
would 
define 
how 
many 
individuals could live in the 
house. In order to increase the 
maximum population allowed 
in the house, the fraternity 
or sorority would be forced 
to apply for another special 
exception use standard.
Capitalizing on the theme of 
zoning, the council also focused 
on a $4.2 million repurchase. 
During an hour-long closed 
session, the council discussed 

the repurchase of the former 
YMCA lot on 350 S. Fifth Ave.
Amid 
controversy 
over 
the repurchase and due to a 
stalemate in the voting process, 
the council was forced to table 
the discussion and moved the 
decision to the next council 
meeting.
The repurchase was part 
of an agreement created four 
years ago. Under this agreement 
the council was given the right 
to repurchase the site after 
four years if the agreed upon 
development didn’t come to 
fruition by April 2018, the city 
could buy back the lot for either 
the appraised value or $4.2 
million — whichever would be 
lower.
As a result of the council’s 

consideration of repurchasing 
the site, the property’s current 
owner, Dennis Dahlmann, is 
currently in the process of suing 
the city over the property in 
hopes of getting four more years 
to bring the project to fruition 
within the specifications of the 
council for affordable housing 
development.
Many 
members, 
including 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor, 
Councilmember 
Ackerman 
and 
Councilmember 
Chuck 
Warpehoski, D-Ward 5, argued 
the purchase would be a simple 
decision.
“There is a lot of public good 
for affordable housing, for street 
lights, even for road repair we 
could do with that money,” 
Warpehoski said.

While Councilmembers Jack 
Eaton, D-Ward 4, and Sumi 
Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, argued 
against the purchase.
“It’s a huge risk,” Eaton said. 
“We’ve known for quite some 
time that this building would 
not be done today, yet here 
we are discussing what we 
are going to do. I don’t think 
it’s responsible for us to use 
that reserve account for this 
purpose.”
The 
resolution 
needed 
eight 
votes 
to 
pass. 
With 
Eaton, 
Kailasapathy 
and 

Councilmember 
Annie 

Bannister, D-Ward 1, voting 
against 
the 
resolution, 
the 
council was forced to table the 
discussion until the next council 
meeting.

Claims of fake news have 
pervaded American news media 
in the year and a half since the 
2016 
presidential 
election. 
Yet as the LSA Donia Human 
Rights Center at the University 
of Michigan aimed to illustrate 
Monday, the accuracy of facts 
and data is under question 
abroad, too. A human rights 
conference 
Monday 
titled 
“Frontiers of Human Rights 
Research: 
Methodological 
Innovations and New Rights 
Issues,” organized by Center 
Director 
Kiyoteru 
Tsutsui, 
associate professor of sociology, 
gave audiences a broad picture 
of human rights in the world 
today.
“The 
idea 
behind 
the 
conference is looking at what’s 
going on in the world today,” 
Tsutsui 
said. 
“Fact-based 
policymaking is under threat 
— there’s a lot of fake news, 
alternative facts and all that, 
so reports on human rights 
violations are often questioned 
in a way that really undermines 
the legitimacy of claims by 
the victims. So we wanted to 
present some methodological 
innovations that have been 
taking place in the field of 
human 
rights 
research 
to 
showcase that there are ways to 
collect data that produce good, 
solid empirical research that 
is very strong in terms of its 
evidentiary basis.”
The 
talk 
featured 
four 
different 
panels 
discussing 
developments in human rights 
research and human rights 
issues in general. Discussions 
revolved around new ways to 
collect data on human rights, 
as well as new human rights 
challenges that we have to face 
now such as drones.
Tsutsui said he hoped people 
in attendance would be able to 
learn about techniques in the 
field they didn’t know about 
before.
“I want people who attend to 
take away from the conference 
that there are all kinds of 
exciting research that is being 
conducted by scholars who 
study these things,” Tsutsui 
said.
Author 
Beth 
Simmons, 
professor of law and political 
science at the University of 
Pennsylvania, gave the keynote 
speech. Simmons talked about 
the future of human rights, and 
said she was impressed by the 
papers and theories presented 
by the panel members.
“I 
think 
the 
future 
of 
international rights is going to 
be a good one based on what 
I’ve heard today,” Simmons 
said.
Simmons said the world is 
at a juncture in the area of 
international 
human 
rights, 
and discussed some theories as 
to why this was the case. Her 
talk focused on the economic 
effects of human rights, as 

well as the fragility of many 
of the democracies in the 
world that are meant to ensure 
these human rights. She also 
discussed the effects the media 
and reports of human rights 
issues have on public opinion of 
these issues.
“So much of what passes 
for 
research 
on 
human 
rights is headline changing,” 
Simmons said. “Human rights 
researchers will often just start 
off by talking about everything 
that is wrong in the world and 
tell you that the world is on an 
irretrievable decline and that 
human rights are at the end of 
times.”
She 
also 
mentioned 
human 
rights 
activists 
as 
unintentionally contributing to 
this issue of perception.
“Human rights activists need 
to keep us aware of the negative 
developments in the world, 
and because it’s their job, and 
because they’re so good at it, 
we get such a negative sense of 
the world,” Simmons said.
To counter this, Simmons 
showed 
some 
major 
improvements 
that 
have 
occurred within the realm of 
human rights. She brought up 
the decline in infant mortality 
rates, the decrease in the 
disparity between men and 
women’s wages, the percentage 
of countries that are under 

democratic 
governments 
and the evident decline of 
human deaths in international 
conflicts in the past 50 years.
“We seem to be killing each 
other less than we have done in 
the past,” Simmons said.
However, 
Simmons 
also 
acknowledged while progress 
was happening, it was certainly 
no easy feat, and it also isn’t 
permanent.
“International human rights 
progress has been real, and 
slow, it has been selective, and 
it is also fragile,” Simmons said. 
“There is absolutely nothing 
inevitable about what I showed 
you.”
LSA junior Jonathan Aue 
attended the talk, and though 
he said it was not as interesting 
as others he has attended, he 
was still interested in the topic.
“Right 
now 
we’ve 
got 
problems with Cuba, China and 
Iran taking away their women’s 
rights, and that is against 
our Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights,” Aue said. “It’s 
a global problem so everyone 
should be stepping in to figure 
out why exactly they’re getting 
away with it.”

Less 
than 
six 
months 
ago, 
Business 
sophomores 
Raymond Sukanto and Victor 
Mahdavi 
bonded 
over 
a 
frustration many University 
of Michigan students have 
at parties — feeling helpless 
over a bad music playlist. 
In a matter of a few weeks, 
they 
partnered 
with 
LSA 
sophomore 
Dan 
Kaper 
to 
create a music queuing app 
called UpNext to assist fellow 
music-minded 
students 
on 
their nights out.
The app is run by a team of 
devoted University students, 
across LSA, the Ross School 
of Business and the College of 
Engineering, whose mission 
is to unite students at social 
gatherings over the aux cord. 
UpNext serves as a platform 
for creating a collaborative 
playlist, where users are given 
the power to suggest songs and 
“upvote” or “downvote” tracks 
on the queue.
Though the app primarily 
functions 
as 
a 
playlist 
generator, the team’s vision is 
to consolidate party planning 
by transforming UpNext into 
a social app, where users can 
locate nearby events.
“The main thing now is us 
focusing on being a music-
sharing app, but the end goal 

is to be something more, like 
a social media platform where 
we could essentially help a 
user decide and plan out their 
entire night, from where they 
go, who they go with, and then 
eventually what music they 
listen to,” Kaper said. “The 
idea is to become a more of an 
all-inclusive way to connect 
and 
experience 
parties 
together.”
Since its launch on the Apple 
App Store in January, UpNext 
has been downloaded by over 
500 users, including Business 
freshman Alana Gartenberg.
“Before, you could have 
been fighting over the aux or 
fighting over the music and 
it took away from the time 
you could have been spending 
talking about other things,” 
Gartenberg said. “This app 
makes it so much easier to just 
put in what you want.”
UpNext’s 
current 
users 
have accumulated organically 
through word-of-mouth and 
small publicity stunts, like 
sponsored 
Snapchat 
filters. 
The team paid for Snapchat 
filters 
in 
Puerto 
Vallarta, 
Mexico over Spring Break, as 
well as multiple party spaces 
over St. Patrick’s Day weekend.
However, 
Mahdavi 
said 
the team has strayed away 
from depending on marketing 
strategies to promote the app 
and instead are focusing on 
letting the product sell itself.

“We 
didn’t 
put 
enough 
emphasis 
on 
the 
actual 
design,” 
Mahdavi 
said. 
“I 
think 
most 
successful 
companies that make social 
media products really focus on 
the product. Then it speaks for 
itself. People will use it if they 
like it.”
Kaper, 
who 
worked 
on 
developing 
the 
app, 
said 
the 
team 
recognizes 
app 
design is vital in attracting 
users. In recent weeks, the 
app’s developing team has 
concentrated 
on 
cleaning 
the user interface design by 
minimizing 
screens 
users 
must 
swipe 
through 
and 
introducing a “home” screen, 
which 
is 
widely 
used 
in 
popular apps like Snapchat 
and Tinder.
“The main idea is to create 
simplicity,” Kaper said. “It’s 
easier to retain the user if the 
appearance on the app is pretty 
easy and straightforward.”
One of UpNext’s selling 
points is that it was created 
for college students, by college 
students. The team spends 
every week updating the app 
based on students’ reactions to 
it with a hearty goal of 1,500 to 
2,000 downloads by the end of 
the semester.
The hardest part of the 
process, according to Sukanto, 
is getting those users.
“You 
never 
know, 
at 
this 
stage, 
what 
people 

really want,” Sukanto said. 
“Everything is still a guessing 
game. That’s why every week 
we push to test and see if it 
improves. It’s a cycle.”
According 
to 
Sukanto, 
UpNext is putting Ann Arbor 
first this semester, focusing on 
reaching out to students in the 
area, but next semester’s plans 
foresee a push to other college 
towns. 
“Our goal this semester 
is truly about learning what 
product features work and 
what 
marketing 
strategies 
work,” Sukanto said. “Right 
now, our only focus is Ann 
Arbor.”
Members 
of 
the 
team 
have 
gotten 
support 
from 
CHISL Design, a student-run 
branding group, as well as 
from Entrepreneurship 412, a 
University course modeled on 
real-world startup incubators 
and 
accelerator 
programs. 
However, 
Mahdavi 
said 
what helps drive the app’s 
development the most is the 
support they get from each 
other.
“School is super important, 
that’s why we’re here and 
learning so much, and that’s 
how we met each other,” 
Mahdavi said. “But there’s 
something very exciting about 
having your own app and 
having something to your own 
name and seeing people have 
fun with it.”

back and forth, and sometimes 
they would be almost equal.”
Reverend 
Lindasusan 
Ulrich, an assistant minister 
at First Unitarian Universalist 
Congregation of Ann Arbor, 
acknowledged this struggle, 
but also said she was able to 
find ways to join her religious 
and queer identities.
“For me, I see definitive 
connections having a non-
monosexual 
identity 
and 
being a Unitarian Universalist 
in that there’s an openness 
to different possibilities and 
a curiosity about different 
possibilities,” 
Ulrich 
said. 
“I realized how much that 
openness has influenced me in 
my ministry. For me, they are 
very intertwined.”
Panelists also described the 
issues they had in being open 
about their queer identities 
in religious settings, or vice 
versa. These two communities 
have a history of negative 
interactions — a recent one 
being accusations against a 
church in Detroit of planning 
conversion therapy workshops. 
Incidents 
of 
discrimination 
like the church in Detroit 
cause 
animosity 
in 
both 
communities.
A Public Health graduate 
student, 
who 
requested 
to 
be anonymous due to her 
sensitive identity, said many 

may believe the stereotype of 
Muslims being homophobic, 
which can make it hard for 
her to interact in queer spaces. 
She also said while her Muslim 
group of friends is very open, 
conversations 
about 
gender 
and sexuality are more closed-
off in mosques.
“Most of my Muslim friends 
never really had to say, ‘It’s 
cool to be gay’ within our 
friend circles, but if we went to 
mosques or we went to Sunday 
school, there was a kind of 
hesitation with being so open 
and expressive about it,” she 
said.
An undergraduate student 
who also requested anonymity 
felt 
similarly 
about 
her 
queer and orthodox Jewish 
communities. She highlighted 
the unwillingness to discuss 
sexuality within the Jewish 
community, as well as the lack 
of 
awareness 
surrounding 
Judaism in LGBTQ+ spaces.
“It’s hard to find ritual 
spaces that are meaningful 
for me because when you go in 
and your identity isn’t there, 
or it’s erased, or it’s invisible,” 
she said. “In the wider LGBTQ 
spaces, I encounter a lot of 
ignorance about Judaism, what 
it is, what its rituals are like. 
This can be hard when you 
want to start to talk to people 
about things, and have them 
understand where you come 
from.”
Both 
Jewish 
and 
Muslim 
students 
talked 

about the genderedness of 
their 
respective 
religions, 
particularly in their rituals and 
traditions. The Muslim student 
discussed the gender divide 
between men and women in 
mosques, and how this has a 
harmful effect on members of 
the LGBTQ+ community. The 
Jewish student expressed her 
pain in acknowledging because 
of her sexuality, she won’t 
be able to partake in certain 
traditions.
“It’s hard, the knowledge 
that in some ways I won’t 
really be able to participate in 
the milestones and rituals that 
are important to me because 
of my sexuality, because of the 
possible gender of my future 
spouse, and because of inherent 
gender 
separation 
in 
the 
rituals,” she said.
To 
work 
through 
these 
struggles, the religious leaders 
among the panelists emphasized 
education. Ulrich said she uses 
her position as a minister to her 
advantage in terms of teaching 
her 
congregation 
about 
LGBTQ+ issues.
“Sometimes the teaching is 
really vital because I have the 
privilege of a pulpit from which 
I can say things like, ‘How can 
this open our minds?’” Ulrich 
said. “‘How about we think 
about this?’”
The Jewish student offered 
up 
a 
different 
viewpoint, 
questioning whether she has 
an obligation to educate her 
peers on these issues.

“On 
the 
one 
hand, 
we 
shouldn’t have to, but on 
the other hand, if you don’t 
advocate for yourself, who’s 
going to?” she asked.
In response to a question 
posed by an audience member 
on how to approach coming 
out, the panelists had differing 
perspectives. The Muslim and 
Jewish 
students 
expressed 
how it’s unnecessary to come 
out to everyone while Spencer 
emphasized the importance of 
doing what feels comfortable.
“If I may give you a bit of 
advice: Do it at your pace, 
at what feels right for you,” 
Spencer said. “Don’t let other 
people tell you how fast you 
have to go.”
Alyssa Cozad, an academic 
advisor at the Stamps School 
of 
Art 
and 
Design, 
felt 
enlightened by the perspectives 
and opinions of the panelists. 
The difficulties the panelists 
expressed in trying to live 
authentically 
and 
exist 
in 
either spiritual or LGBTQ+ 
spaces resonated with her. She 
expressed her hopes for events 
of a similar nature.
“There’s room certainly for 
more of this on campus and in 
the Ann Arbor community,” 
Cozad said. “We’re an open 
community, I hope, for a lot 
of people and a resource for 
people. So I like to come to 
these sorts of events so that 
I can let them inform my 
work and how I relate with 
students.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

E

verybody 
who 
went 

to 
a 
stereotypical 

American high school 

or has even just seen “Gossip 
Girl” knows that high schools 
have cliques. If you walk into 
the cafeteria, a quick scan of 
seating arrangements reveals 
these exclusive groups: The 
jocks sit in the corner booth, 
the theater kids sit with each 
other, as do the nerds and 
the band kids take their food 
to go eat in the band room. 
Nevertheless, 
every 
year 

there is one kid who shocks 
the world and moves from 
the nerd table to the jock 
table by either hitting the 
gym all summer or somehow 
getting a girl who sits at 
that table (Hey Dan). The 
state of world politics is not 
entirely different — there are 
small exclusive tables where 
decisions 
are 
made 
that 

impact the whole world, such 
as the U.N. Security Council, 
the Group of Seven and Group 
of 20 summits. However, how 
do countries get spots in these 
exclusive groups? How can 
the nerd (North Korea) get 
at the same table as the jocks 
(the U.S. and China)?

In the past, nations have 

developed their geopolitical 
prestige in one of two ways: 
the economy or the military. 
Some nations, such as China, 
became international powers 
by rapidly developing their 
economy 
and 
becoming 

trade partners with other 
superpowers, 
such 
as 
the 

United States. In fact, it 
was not until recently that 
China started to really build 
up 
its 
military. 
Similarly, 

Germany 
became 
one 
of 

the most important, if not 
the most important, players 
in Europe by becoming an 
economic powerhouse. At the 
same time, Germany became 
extremely 
demilitarized 

after World War II, and its 
new constitution held that 
Germany’s 
military 
would 

only be a defense mechanism. 
On the other hand, Kim Jong-
un and North Korea have made 

another bet altogether. They 
believe that the path to the 
cool kids’ table goes through a 
nuclear weapons program.

On numerous occasions in 

the past, Kim has made public 
statements 
that 
basically 

make the argument that if 
North Korea does not have 
nuclear 
weapons, 
it 
will 

never be taken seriously as 
a geopolitical actor. In fact, 
a member of then-President 
Barack 
Obama’s 
National 

Security 
Council 
said 
as 

much: “If you were the head of 
a small, isolated, poor country 
surrounded 
by 
potentially 

hostile military powers, you’d 
be looking for some way to 
ensure your own destiny, too.” 
Basically, if you were a nerd 
that didn’t want to be picked 
on any longer, you would hit 
the gym too.

This past week Kim began 

his foray into the jock’s ground 
by 
meeting 
with 
Chinese 

President Xi Jinping. Kim has 
already used the meeting as 
propaganda for the usefulness 
of 
his 
nuclear 
weapons 

program. North Korean state 
media showed images of its 
leader 
looking 
charismatic 

with a large motorcade. In 
another image, it appeared 
that Xi was making a toast to 
Kim. Whether the narrative is 
true or not, Kim can now claim 
that he was on even footing 
with the leader of one of the 
world’s most powerful nations.

Now, 
to 
the 
question 

at 
hand: 
Why 
shouldn’t 

President 
Donald 
Trump 

meet with Kim? At face value, 
this meeting seems to be an 
unmitigated success — Trump 
has managed to do what his 
predecessors couldn’t. He got 
Kim to come to the negotiating 
table. However, by doing so, 
Trump would effectively be 
validating everything Kim has 
done up until this point. Let’s 
start from the beginning. Kim 
started 
developing 
nuclear 

weapons under the premise 
that he would not be taken 
seriously by the superpowers 
if he did not have these 
weapons of mass destruction. 
Time and time again, these 
superpowers tried to stop 
him from getting the nuclear 
weapons without giving him 
a seat at the table. Eventually, 
he was able to advance his 
nuclear capabilities to the 
point where, in his eyes, 
he is now a credible threat. 
Consequently, Kim was able 
to visit Beijing and meet with 
one of the most powerful men 
in the world.

Now, he has a chance 

to meet with the leader of 
the free world. If you were 
Kim or the leader of another 
smaller nation, what would 
you conclude from this series 
of events? If you do not have 
the 
capability 
to 
become 

an 
economic 
powerhouse, 

the only way to become a 
player at the big boys’ table 
is to become a military power 
through 
the 
acquisition 

of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
So, 

President Trump, I’d urge you 
to carry on with caution and 
pay attention to the kinds of 
signals you are sending. It’s 
easy to get distracted by porn 
stars and special counsels. 
Especially with what seems 
like an endless stream of news 
that comes out of this White 
House, there’s only so much 
we can keep track of, but this 
one decision, no matter how 
dry, could have implications 
for the security of the world.

Trump to meet Kim, why not?

ANDREW WHITE | LETTER TO THE EDITOR
I 
 

am a dual French and 
Cellular and Molecular 
Biology 
major 
at 
the 

University of Michigan, and 
I am responding to The Daily 
article titled, “An Open Letter 
to the French Department.” 
My perspective is different 
insofar as I had not spoken 
a word of French until my 
arrival at the University of 
Michigan. I still remember 
the first day of French 100 
during winter semester of 
my freshman year, when my 
instructor 
conducted 
two 

hours of class in French and 
I understood only two words: 
“oui” and “non.”

Critiques 
of 
the 

program with regard to a 
heavy workload and tough 
grading are unfair. As a 
science major, I have taken 
many courses in which all-
nighters’worth of studying 
is 
merely 
an 
expectation 

of the class. The grading is 

tough, the workload is heavy 
and students are expected 
to 
take 
responsibility 
for 

their own learning, both in 
the Romance Languages and 
Literatures Department and 
in the Program in Biology. I 
am proud to have completed 

the introductory sequence in 
the French program because I 
know the work that I put into 
this rigorous program was 
accurately reflected in my 
grade and in my performance 

in the language.

Resources 
are 
available 

to ensure that success is 
within reach to all students. 
To learn a language as a young 
adult is a challenge that is 
unique for both those teaching 
and those learning. In my 
experience in the RLL, all the 
lecturers and professors are 
rooting for your success in the 
language, in their courses and 
in life. Assigned homework, 
the workshop-style “flipped 
classroom,”office 
hours 

and the Language Resource 
Center are all examples of 
resources 
implemented 
by 

the French program for its 
students’success. The resources 
are here for success in the 
introductory French sequence, 
and it is up to students to take 
advantage of them.

Critiques of the 
program with 

regard to a heavy 

workload and 

tough grading are 

unfair.

Andrew White is an LSA Senior.

Basically, if you

O

ver 
the 
past 
year, 

I’ve decided to join a 
variety of Facebook 

groups. In a way, it’s the 
return of the Facebook likes of 
the past. When I was a kid, I’d 
like some interesting or funny 
one-liner that was, as the kids 
say, “#relatable” and then I 
would 
immediately 
forget 

about it for something more 
important, like the number of 
likes my last Facebook photo 
received. These liked pages 
would show up on my feed for a 
few days, my friends would like 
these pages and then they’d 
be gone forever. Now, though, 
these Facebook pages have 
taken a different form: groups 
that have specific interests or 
topics in which individuals can 
post in and talk about related 
issues. This is fun, but it might 
not sound as great when you 
realize that this is just another 
way to silo oneself into an 
information system.

At first glance, Facebook 

groups might appear to be a 
good thing. It goes without 
saying that there are serious 
benefits from marginalized 
or 
niche 
groups 
coming 

together 
to 
talk 
about 

common interests. And as 
I’m sure your tour guide let 
you 
know, 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
has 
tons 
of 

those on campus: Whether 
you’re interested in political 
activism or squirrels, finding 
individuals here on campus 
that you share interests with 
provides social benefits for 
the person, including those 
aforementioned 
Facebook 

likes. 
These 
organizations 

can help people acclimate to 
campus and discuss common 
issues 
and 
interests. 
One 

could say Facebook groups are 
doing the same thing: People 
interested in public transit or 
advocacy surrounding public 
transit use can find many 
groups on Facebook, but I 
don’t believe these groups 
have the same impact as 
organizations on campus.

One of the largest benefits 

is also one of the biggest 
downsides to Facebook groups. 
Because of the huge reach of 
Facebook, you can get a variety 

of individuals to be a part of 
a group. This means people 
from all over the country 
and globe can join a meme 
page. This connectedness is 
wonderful, and provides a 
meaningful 
community 
for 

some, but it also has a key 
problem: information silos. 
Like Reddit, we can see how 
these 
communities 
draw 

people further into their own 
issues 
and 
beliefs. 
Reddit 

allows individuals to pick 
their communities and only 
see information inside them. 
I worry Facebook is doing the 
same thing. My participation 
in Facebook group culture, 
which incorporates a variety 
of my political beliefs as 
well as my passionate love 
of memes, has likely made it 
where I see fewer opinions 
different than my own on 
my feed. I consider myself 
someone who tries to engage 
in politics from all sides — 
I am “that guy” who will 
comment on a post I disagree 
with — and I can say that the 
changes and rise of Facebook 
group culture give none of 
the benefits of a student 
organization on campus while 
giving all of the features of 
groupthink. A Facebook group 
discussing public transit gives 
all of the benefits without, say, 
the arguments one might want 
to hear regarding American 
hesitancy of raising taxes and 
how we might have to give up 
or cut back on social programs 
that might be hurting the 
exact group of people we’re 
interested in helping.

In the meantime, Facebook 

CEO 
Mark 
Zuckerberg 

announced 
that 
he 
is 

doubling-down on Facebook 
group culture and has stated 
his interest in continuing and 
growing 
Facebook 
groups. 

Facebook launched its first 
“Communities 
Summit,” 

noting that the goal of the 
event 
is 
to 
“strengthen 

people’s online and offline 
connections.” Zuckerberg is 
right that group participation 
offline has been declining, 
and, 
for 
over 
40 
years, 

the social science body of 
literature has suggested that 

we are losing some of those 
ties that help bond us together 
and make us feel rooted in a 
community.

And there’s good reason 

for 
Zuckerberg 
to 
create 

this 
event. 
The 
divisive 

nature of politics right now 
is near an all-time high. In 
constructing a website that 
has an algorithm to determine 
what you see, you can imagine 
that it is in a company’s best 
interest to keep you on the 
website for as long as possible. 
Since Facebook is free, it 
has to sell you, the user, to 
advertisers. Reasonably, this 
can lead a company to show 
you things you agree with 
and have you avoid things 
you don’t. But, unfortunately, 
that won’t help people avoid 
confirming 
existing 
beliefs 

and won’t allow for their 
ideas to be challenged. An 
article 
from 
The 
Atlantic 

talks about how, from an 
evolutionary 
perspective, 

having 
social 
support 
far 

outweighs knowing the truth. 
Having people on board with 
an idea had far larger benefits 
in a society where social 
support meant life or death. 
Now? I’d like to imagine my 
Facebook likes are, perhaps, 
not as important as having 
well-founded opinions and an 
interest in political advocacy. 
But what do I know?

Information 
silos 
from 

Facebook are not new, but 
groups are a new iteration 
of this same problem. When 
Facebook 
announced 
they 

were going to put groups and 
your personal contacts as a 
priority on your feed instead 
of news articles, Facebook 
chose confirmation bias over 
a diversity of information. 
I hope to see a world where 
Facebook 
is 
a 
democratic 

platform 
where 
one 
can 

engage in substantive debate. 
Groups 
might 
be 
able 
to 

increase our Facebook likes, 
but they’re certainly not going 
to mend the divisive rhetoric 
in this country.

If breakfast food were a major 

offered at the University, I’d have 
a 4.0. I wouldn’t even need to 
re-subscribe to my Chegg account 
if I were taking classes like “Intro 
to How Do You Like Your Eggs” 
instead of Polisci 495.

Breakfast is my favorite meal 

of the day. I go to bed thinking 
of it, and it’s my first thought 
every morning. Especially since 
moving to Ann Arbor, I’ve had an 
infatuation with scrambled eggs, 
puffy cheese filled omelettes, the 
endless toppings one could put on 
a stack of warm buttery pancakes 
and the innumerable things one 
can do to a plate of potatoes (a 
side dish which, if done right, can 
steal the spotlight from the main 
course). My mornings at home 
are always paired with a mug of 
black coffee — preferably Keurig 
Dunkin Donuts original blend in 
my Good Morning, Ann Arbor 
mug and a bowl of steaming 
hot oatmeal with a swirl of 
crunchy almond butter, a dash of 
cinnamon and a handful of fresh 
raspberries. That’s the best way 
to pre-game any Monday through 
Friday that begins at 8:00 a.m. 
and ends whenever I manage 
to check all the boxes on a 
neverending to-do list. Especially 
after a morning run or late 
night studying, breakfast is an 
important staple in the 24-hour 
routine of a college student.

In the rulebook I live by, 

breakfast is an essential — and the 
brightest — part of my morning. 
This mantra has been instilled 
inside me since early childhood, 
when my father began a serious 
and unique 6:30 a.m. standing 
breakfast date which he called 
“choices,” where my brothers and 
I would gather around our kitchen 
table before school and he’d make 
a selection of different gourmet 
breakfast foods to start out our 
day on the right foot. I was lucky 
enough to have this tradition 
from elementary school to the last 
day of senior year of high school, 
running down the stairs with 
my backpack to a kitchen filled 
with the scent of lemon blueberry 
ricotta waffles or a pancetta goat 
cheese frittata (always served 
with a crisp of bread and pool of 
olive oil). I learned about how to 
fuel my body as I transitioned 
from child to adult, to never skip 
breakfast and that the best way to 
make a frittata fluffy is to whisk 
a tablespoon of cream cheese into 
your eggs.

It isn’t hard to explain the 

appeal of breakfast, but it’s the 
most contested meal of the day — 
people don’t like to get up early, 
“aren’t hungry in the morning,” 
“can’t eat till they have coffee” 
— the list goes on. The perfect 
solution for the breakfast haters 
of the world is brunch: An early 
afternoon meal — the contraction 
between breakfast and lunch and 
an excuse to pair french toast 
with alcohol. The brunch scene in 
Ann Arbor is unlike anything I’ve 
ever come across in my 19-year-
long 
uninterrupted 
breakfast 

restaurant tour.

To me, the promise of a good 

breakfast can make anybody 

a morning person, and I feel 
as though the brunch scene 
in Ann Arbor makes the city 
a breeding ground for brunch 
fiends. Sometimes, I feel as 
though the brunch trend takes 
the foundation of breakfast as the 
best meal of the day and pushes 
it aside a bit. Therefore, I’m an 
adamant believer in not only the 
Saturday / Sunday brunch but 
the mundane, daily, everyday 
breakfast date. For me, a 9:00 a.m. 
Wednesday breakfast date can be 
nicer than the 11:30 a.m. Sunday 
brunch with the gaggle of high 
school seniors trying to scheme 
their way into a few mimosas.

That’s why it’s good news that 

Ann Arbor’s brunch restaurants 
serve breakfast every day of the 
week. Ann Arbor has too many 
breakfast places to count, which 
suits a breakfast fiend like me 
quite well. I like to think of 
these places on a spectrum, from 
important staples like Fleetwood 
Diner 
to 
boujee 
spots 
like 

Savas and Avalon Cafe, there’s 
something for everyone, even 
when you aren’t quite a morning 
person.

If I’m in the mood for 

something greasy, a hangover 
cure or perhaps a late night 
breakfast snack, I always head to 
Fleetwood Diner. The distance 
and the wait are both worth it 
for the hippie hash, the signature 
dish of Fleetwood. A pile of 
buttery hash browns covered 
in a blanket of feta cheese (with 
a side of fries, eggs and crispy 
bacon, in my opinion) is quite 
possibly the very best thing I’ve 
ever tasted. That paired with the 
quaint atmosphere, the dim, dull 
lighting, click of the cash register 
and walls covered with so many 
stickers you can’t even see the 
paint 
makes 
the 
Fleetwood 

experience one in a million.

However, when my parents are 

in town, we’re big Avalon fans — 
they serve some sort of blueberry 
pancake heaven in a heavy metal 
skillet which pairs perfectly 
with fresh maple syrup and any 
of their signature lattes. Avalon 
specializes in a fresh, unique 
take on a traditional breakfast, 
serving greens on the side of 
frittatas and omelettes, which is 
exactly the way my dad likes his 
breakfast. The vibe in Avalon is 
warm and inviting, the seating 
comfortable and the coffee bar 
to die for. If you’re looking for 
the best muffins and pastries 
around, Avalon is a go-to — their 
baked goods and pastries are 
what they’re known for, and they 
certainly don’t disappoint.

I consider Savas the birthday 

brunch spot or the “student 
scene,” as any given Sunday 
morning 
it 
is 
filled 
with 

backpacks and celebration. Their 
brunch buffet is a favorite of 
mine, as it is almost as unlimited 
as my stomach’s capacity for 
breakfast foods. The mini quiches 
and chocolate desserts always 
line my Savas breakfast plate, and 
I also really like their selections 
of smoothies and juices. Their 
Sunday brunch buffet is $20 and 
includes a mimosa — a great way 
to get stuffed and celebrate a 
birthday or a job offer, while also 
getting tipsy.

Despite its consistently long 

line, Fred’s, an E. Washington 
health-minded breakfast cafe, is 
also one of my favorite places to 
indulge my breakfast fantasies. 
Between delicious açaí bowls 
and the divine toast selections, 
you can’t go wrong with Fred’s. 
A common destination for the 
girl searching for the perfect 
Instagram 
(it’s 
quite 
the 

aesthetic) or the healthy vegan 
foodie, Fred’s is one of my favorite 
places to go with friends for a 
ricotta toast or a matcha latte. 
Fred’s is on the pricier side for 
sure, but when I’m seeking out my 
favorite Kombucha or anything 
that has the word “tumeric,” I 
normally know I’m in the market 
to splurge a bit.

I never realized how truly 

delicious frozen yogurt is on 
top of a warm, grilled blueberry 
muffin until I went to Afternoon 
Delight one frozen Ann Arbor 
morning. The quaint, diner-
style cafe has choices from giant 
omelettes to crispy pecan waffles 
and cinnamon french toast. The 
true quirk of Afternoon Delight is 
in their fro-yo topped muffins, an 
unconventional, albeit heavenly, 
side dish I never knew would 
complete all of my breakfast 
fantasies. I’m willing to say that 
the muffins at Afternoon Delight 
are the best muffins in Ann Arbor, 
and perhaps the world. And trust 
me, I know my muffins.

No matter how far I venture 

from Catherine Street, my favorite 
Ann Arbor breakfast place is, and 
always will be, Angelo’s. Standing 
since 1956, the child of two 
Greek immigrants, Angelo’s is 
at once both home and a foodie’s 
journey. Their commitment to 
the standard, traditional diner 
breakfast with its own perfect 
individualities makes Angelo’s 
familiar to a Jersey girl who is 
very used to a classic diner. I am 
a big fan of the chocolate chip 
pancakes, perfectly fluffy and 
buttery with syrup dripping on 
to the white ceramic plate, but 
I’m also absolutely married to 
the spinach and feta omelette 
(side of raisin toast grilled, side 
of potatoes — carb loading, you 
know?) and sometimes I just 
have to get both. Everyone knows 
Angelo’s for their crispy yet sweet 
raisin toast, and I am willing to 
admit that sometimes I dream 
that I am asleep on a pile of it, 
and then I wake up with my head 
on my pillow and just have to go 
to Catherine street to satisfy my 
cravings.

While there is no “Intro to 

How Do You Like Your Eggs?” 
or “Chocolate Chips to Pancake 
Ratio 
301” 
courses 
at 
the 

University, one can certainly 
become educated in breakfast 
foods in their years as a student 
here. From the over 10 different 
options for breakfast right in 
the heart of the city, it’s feasible 
and honestly honorable to try 
them all enough times to taste 
all of the staple menu items (and 
maybe a few more). There are 
just over 150 Sundays in my four 
years as a Wolverine (hard to 
believe I’m almost done with 75 
of them), and you can bet that I’m 
taking breakfast very seriously 
somewhere (even if it’s just a 
dining hall) on each and every 
one.

Fresh Check Day raises 
mental health awareness

On most cold Friday mornings 

in Mar., the Diag is empty. Yet 
this year, on a windy, 30-degree 
day only weeks away from the 
end of the term, the Diag was 
full of activity. This was Fresh 
Check Day, a gathering of student 
organizations 
and 
University 

programs 
aimed 
at 
raising 

awareness 
of 
mental 
health 

issues on campus. It was lead 
by Call for Humanity, a newly 
created 
student 
organization 

aimed at promoting dialogue 
and awareness of mental health 
around campus.

Students had the opportunity 

to visit different tables and 
learn about the mental health 
resources available to students. 
The Health Science Scholars 

Program, SAPAC, the Depression 
Center, Club Sports, Redefine, 
Body Peace Corps, Out of the 
Dark and CAPS in Action were all 
represented.

At the corner of the Diag, the 

LSA Student Government had set 
up a nine out of 10 booth. “One in 
ten college students contemplates 
suicide,” they explained in one 
of their pamphlets. “That leaves 
nine out of 10 to reach out and 
help someone.” Students visiting 
the booth were asked to sign a 
pledge of support as a member of 
the nine out of 10. Students were 
also provided information about 
the warning signs and the steps 
that one can take to help those in 
need.

“We 
started 
‘Call 
for 

Humanity’ last year during the 
election period,” said LSA junior 
Samir Harake in an interview 
with The Daily. “We wanted to 

address issues that affect a lot 
of the students.” The event, he 
explained, was meant to “bring 
people together to say ‘we hear 
this problem’” and to “create some 
change in how it’s addressed.”

“We wanted to focus on 

creating collaborative events,” 
said Rafik Issa, an LSA junior. 
“Our role was contacting the 
different groups and getting them 
together. They all bring different 
perspectives to this and it has 
been challenging but also very 
informative to work with all of 
them.”

“We talked to the LSA Student 

Government and the student 
organizations that do the work on 
the ground about mental health,” 
Harake explained. “They affect 
a lot of the students on campus 
and they can really create some 
change.”

Spielberg finds humanity 
behind ‘Ready Player One’

I’m well aware of the position 

I’m putting myself in when I 
tell you that I didn’t like Ernest 
Cline’s “Ready Player One,” 
but I hope that my opening 
by saying this means you take 
me seriously when I also tell 
you that Steven Spielberg’s 
(“The Post”) adaptation of 
that novel is the most fun 
you’re liable to have at the 
movies this side of “Infinity 
War.” 
Where 
the 
original 

work drowns out what could 

have been a unique adventure 
under a flood of soulless ’80s 
references and thinly-written 
characters, Spielberg uses his 
talents at combining spectacle 
with humanity to actually 
craft a compelling story and 
take Cline’s work to places 
of 
genuine 
greatness. 
The 

combination of their talents 
doesn’t always work — the 
opening act is so packed with 
exposition, jargon and a rushed 
romance that it recalls any 
number of YA dystopian flicks 
— but when it clicks, it exceeds 
its source material more than 
any of us could have wished.

In no place is this more 

clear-cut than in the film’s 
message. Where the book paid 
mostly empty lip-service to the 
idea of life beyond pop culture, 
Spielberg 
actively 
practices 

what he preaches here. Film, 
television, video games — these 
things can provide an escape, 
but it’s the relationships that 
are built through them that 

are 
most 
important. 
The 

stronger 
characterization 

adds further credence to this 
idea, as do the scene-stealing 
performances 
from 
Olivia 

Cooke 
(“Thoroughbreds”) 

and a stupendously cast Mark 
Rylance (“Dunkirk”)

But the message will almost 

be beside the point for those 
who, unlike me, enjoyed Cline’s 
novel, so let me reassure you 
once again that “Ready Player 
One” is the very definition of 
“fun” from beginning to end. 
The action is as marvelously 
directed as fans of Spielberg 
would expect, with ludicrously 
complex tracking shots galore; 
a wildly over-the-top racing 
scene close to the beginning 
works as a showcase for the 
film’s gorgeous special effects 
as well as an introduction for 
the film’s characters and the 
limitless nature of their world. 
It’s deeply funny, and there’s 
an almost childish tone that 
works given how much the 
story deals with nostalgia.

Even the references, when 

they occur, work much better 
here 
than, 
say, 
dedicating 

an 
entire 
page 
to 
every 

’80s-inspired 
modification 

you made to your DeLorean 
to prove how cool you are. 
That’s part of the benefit 
of film; adapted as visuals, 
there’s a quickness to them 
that allows you to appreciate 
the reference without halting 
the story. Even when the story 
is centered around a particular 
homage — an entire sequence 
is sculpted around an extended 
send-up to Stanley Kubrick’s 
“The Shining” — there’s still 
a novelty to them. A similar 
sequence in the book has the 
main character recite line-
for-line the entirety of “Monty 
Python and the Holy Grail,” 
reducing the lead of the book 
to a passive player in a much 
better story, so when in the 
adaptation, Spielberg actually 
allows 
his 
characters 
to 

interact with iconic set pieces 

of the Overlook Hotel and play 
a part, it works much better.

There’s even what seems 

to be a kind of self-aware 
commentary on the references 
themselves, 
as 
several 
of 

the 
antagonists, 
including 

Ben Mendelsohn’s (“Darkest 
Hour”) Nolan Sorrento, reduce 
themselves to regurgitating 
meaningless references in an 
attempt at pandering to their 

enemies. It’s played for laughs 
when taken at face value, 
but given the criticisms that 
Cline’s novel does much of the 
same thing, it’s an interesting 
dissection of “Ready Player 
One”’s lifeblood.

Given the insane talent of 

the man behind the camera 
and the popularity of the 
book, there probably wasn’t 
much reason to worry about 
“Ready Player One,” and yet 
the degree to which it works 
is still surprising. The best 
parts of Ernest Cline’s book are 
preserved; the fun tone and sci-
fi adventure are the foundation 
the movie is built upon. But 
Spielberg’s flourishes — his 
self-aware direction, smarter 
references 
and 
improved 

characterization — are what 
takes it to the next level.

student 
organizations, 
the 

University’s 
mental 
health 

resources were well represented 
at the event. Student Life’s 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services (CAPS), for example, 
had information on the free 
workshops, presentations and 
therapy that they offer. Michigan 
Medicine’s Depression Center 
was also represented at the event. 
Though known primarily for 
their work in addressing mental 
health policy, they also offer 
support groups for students.

The main focus of the event, 

however, was raising awareness 
of the institutional and cultural 
changes necessary to further 
mental 
health 
improvement 

around campus. Though the 
University does address mental 
health, there is always more to be 
done.

“There is so much more that 

we can do,” Issa said. “While 
there (are) a lot of resources on 
Central, for example, there’s not 
enough attention to people on 

North Campus.”

“We want people to leave 

here feeling like they learned 
something and that they can 

help people,” Harake said. “We 
have such a vocal campus when it 
comes to social justice issues, but 
this is one that many people don’t 
want to talk about as much. We 
want to take away the black hole 
surrounding it.”

“There’s 
a 
lot 
of 
stigma 

surrounding 
mental 
health,” 

Issa said. “It’s okay if you are 
suffering, and it’s good to seek out 
these resources.”

The 
event 
also 
featured 

performances from Groove, 58 
Greene and Michigan Magic. 
They helped create a fun and open 
atmosphere in which students 
could come together and address 
this stigmatized topic.

“We want people to come have 

fun and get some free stuff,” Issa 
said. “One person suffering is one 
too many and anything that we 
can do to draw attention to this is 
helpful.”

Zach Braff’s return to TV 
completely disappoints

It has been eight years since 

Zach Braff’s defining role as 
goofy doctor J.D. on “Scrubs” 
came to a triumphant end. 
Since then, the New Jersey-
born actor and filmmaker has 
turned his focus to movies, 
including 2014’s “Wish I Was 
Here,” 
which 
Braff 
wrote, 

directed and starred in. Now, 
his focus has shifted back to 
the small screen to take on his 
first sitcom since the wildly 
successful “Scrubs.”

Braff’s 
new 
show 
“Alex, 

Inc.” takes its inspiration from 
the story of Alex Blumberg, 
whose 
successful, 
real-life 

podcast “StartUp” helped him 
create 
the 
award-winning 

narrative 
podcast 
company 

Gimlet Media. Braff plays Alex 
Schuman, 
a 
journalist 
and 

father of two, who quits his job 
at an upbeat radio show to tell 
the hard-hitting, interesting 
stories he wants to tell.

The concept may sound very 

niche and millennial, perhaps 
even a little bit boring, but this is 
Zach Braff we’re talking about. 
This master of witty voiceovers 
and quick asides could make 
“Pawn Stars” into a cheery, 
laugh-out loud thriller. Braff 
brings positivity and quick 
wit to every project he tackles. 
And while in many cases that is 
his greatest strength, it is this 
show’s biggest weakness.

“Alex, 
Inc.” 
is 
far 
too 

polished for the difficult topic 
it tackles. This is a man in his 
mid-thirties who just quit his 
job spontaneously, without so 
much as telling his wife Runi 
(Tiya Sircar, “The Good Place”). 
When he does inform her after 

the fact, she is shocked for 
about a minute before throwing 
all of her support behind him. 
Is it really so bad to see a spouse 
supporting 
their 
significant 

other? No, but “Alex, Inc.” fails 
to do anything to address the 
true weight of the decision that 
Schuman is making, a move 
that could potentially add some 
depth to an otherwise two-
dimensional show.

Braff is still excellent in the 

role, there’s no question of 
that. But the dynamics of the 
characters make it clear that 
this is his show, and nobody 
else’s. One of the reasons that 
“Scrubs” was so beloved is 
that while Braff was the star, 
each supporting character had 
their own distinct personalities 
and storylines, which played 
off 
of 
and 
alongside 
the 

exaggerated 
and 
beautiful 

buffoonery of Braff. In “Alex, 
Inc.,” 
the 
supporting 
cast 

members are nothing more 
than underdeveloped tropes. 
Schuman’s producer Deirdre 
(Hillary 
Anne 
Matthews, 

“Dirtbags”) is essentially his 
groupie, 
while 
his 
second 

cousin and business partner 
Eddie 
(Michael 
Imperioli, 

“Hawaii Five-0”) is nothing 
more than an Italian Mafia 
caricature who delivers the 
occasional somewhat comical 
line. 
The 
most 
punishable 

crime of “Alex, Inc.” is its 
severe misuse of Sircar, who is 
an incredible actress and plays 
a likeable character reduced 
to nothing more than her 
husband’s cheerleader.

“Alex, Inc.” is too bubblegum 

for adults, but too mature to 
be a family show. It is clearly 
focused 
more 
on 
being 
a 

platform for an actor with as 
big of a personality as Braff 
than it is on telling its story 
right or integrating its talented 
cast well. While in “Scrubs,” 
Braff was a key complementary 
component to multiple well-
told stories, in “Alex, Inc.,” 
he is the only story. The 
show chronicles the birth of 
a podcast, a medium that has 
become revolutionary in today’s 
entertainment industry. Yet the 
beauty of podcasts come from 
their ability to convey depth of 
story and emotion, just through 
words. “Alex, Inc.” fails to do 
this even with pictures on their 
side, leaving viewers to assume 
that maybe some stories are 
better left on the radio.

DOOM’s latest is dynamic

Music changes; if it didn’t, 

Gregorian 
chants 
would 

dominate 
Billboard’s 
Hot 

100 chart. Generation after 
generation, old sounds are 
phased out and new sounds 
come to dominate as blends of 
past-respecting influence and 
future-forward 
innovation. 

With this trend, there is and 
always will be a rift between 
older listeners and younger 
listeners — hence why your 
Baby Boomer mom “doesn’t 
get” Frank Ocean.

This contrast, as it pertains 

to hip hop, is especially evident 
on Czarface Meets Metal Face, 
a 
collaborative 
project 
by 

Czarface (a trio pioneered by 
Wu Tang Clan’s Inspectah 
Deck including rapper Esoteric 
and producer 7L) and MF 
DOOM. Soaked in stripped 
down, boom-bap beats and 
clever lyricism, the album is 
nearly indistinguishable from 
dated projects like DOOM’s 
Mm.. 
Food 
or 
Wu 
Tang’s 

Enter The Wu-Tang. It sounds 
undeniably classic, despite its 
2018 release, and makes evident 
the extent to which rap has 
changed over the past 15 years. 

No autotune, no mumbling, no 
booming bass. The production 
is low-volume and crisp, and 
the lyrical delivery is decisive 
and comprehensible.

The premise of the album 

is superhero-based: Czarface, 
a self-described hero, recruits 
Metal Face (a.k.a. MF Doom) 

to be his “villain,” a clever play 
on Doom’s famed Madvillain. 
This loose plot provides some 
structure and flow to the 
album, but more so allows for 
clever and entertaining skits 
and sampling, augmentations 
for which both the Czarface 
trio and Doom are well known.

What 
makes 
the 
album 

especially interesting is the 
dichotomy between sound and 
lyrics. While the tracks act as 
portals to the rap that used 
to be, their lyrical content is 

extremely current: The rappers 
trade 
musings 
on 
popular 

culture with lines like, “It’s on 
the tip of my tongue like Stan 
Smith’s face,” and “Only time 
you set-trip is when you binge 
on Netflix.” When combined 
with the album’s classic sound, 
these modern lyrics make the 
aforementioned evolution of 
hip hop even more obvious. 
The 
nearly 
40-year-old 

Esoteric raps about modern 
shoe trends and streaming 
services, something one would 
expect from the likes of Drake 
or Travis Scott, but the music 
sounds nothing like today’s 
rap.

Now, I don’t want to indicate 

a bias against or dislike toward 
modern hip hop; I love and 
appreciate trap rap and all of 
its booms and mumbles. It’s 
simply interesting that, when 
placed in a modern context, 
outdated 
art 
exposes 
the 

changing of the times. The 
same could be said about Andy 
Warhol’s Marilyn Diptych if it 
were repurposed with the face 
of Kim Kardashian or Johann 
Sebastian Bach’s “Little Fugue 
in G Minor” if Young Thug spit 
a verse on top. With Czarface 
Meets Metal Face, listeners are 
reminded of where hip hop was 
and where it is today.

‘Splitting Up Together’ 
is not worth your effort

I had high hopes that ABC’s 

“Splitting Up Together” would 
make me laugh, especially with 
Ellen Degeneres as one of the 
show’s 
executive 
producers. 

And I mean really laugh — in 
a way that’s greater than the 
fake chuckle family comedies 
normally elicit. But with an 
overwhelming sense of “been 
there, done that,” a couple lacking 
on-screen chemistry and an all 
too predictable plot trajectory, 
“Splitting Up Together” mostly 
falls flat.

Like 
a 
lighter 
version 
of 

HBO’s “Divorce,” “Splitting Up 
Together” follows Lena (Jenna 
Fischer, “The Office”) and Martin 
(Oliver Hudson, “Nashville”), a 
recently divorced couple who 
have decided, on behalf of their 
children and extensive mortgage, 
to remain living under the same 
roof. Well, kind of. The plan 
goes a little something like this: 
Alternating weeks on and off 
duty, one parent lives in the house 
and takes on all the household 
responsibilities, while the other 
gets some much needed rest and 
relaxation in the detached garage.

It sounds simple — and boy is 

it. It’s just a disappointment that 
almost every aspect of the pilot 
is as one-dimensional and basic 
as the premise. Each member of 
the family is forced into a trope 
so constraining and overused that 
there seems to be little room for 
character development down the 
road. Lena is instantantly labeled 
as the uptight, high-strung mom, 
whose neurotic tendencies and 
hypersensitivity are to blame 
for the divorce. And Martin, on 

the other hand, fully embodies 
the 
man-child 
trope, 
acting 

as the cool dad who just can’t 
seem to comprehend emotion or 
communication.

As for the kids — well, the kids 

are just bizarre. They somehow 
seem unusually unphased by their 
parents’ separation. Additionally, 
they are bound by such rigid 
stereotypes that they come off 
more as caricatures of pop culture 
trends than real, living people. The 
oldest son, Mason (Van Crosby, 

“Criminal Minds”), is nothing 
more than a boy embarking on 
the journey that is puberty. In the 
first episode alone, his complaint 
of 
painful 
balls 
completely 

consumes 
his 
already 
short 

moments of dialogue. The pair’s 
fiercely feminist young daughter, 
Mae (newcomer Olivia Keville), is 
almost scarily expressionless, as 
she sips tea from her “Male Tears” 
mug and bashes her brother for 
having a crush on Kate Upton. 
And as for the youngest child, 
Milo (newcomer Sander Thomas), 
the only air time he has been given 
is five seconds of looking cute.

Perhaps the most pressing 

problem 
of 
“Splitting 
Up 

Together” is that it’s trying all 
too hard to be funny. The pilot 
felt strained, as though the actors 
were pausing to let audiences 
know that they had just said a 
joke, and that you should laugh 
now. While there were a couple 

genuine sprinkles of pure comedy, 
like when Lena accidentally texts 
Mason with flirty messages, most 
of the punchlines fail to deliver.

Among the cast, Jenna Fischer 

was truly the only actor who 
delivered a winning performance. 
As Lena, she was convincing 
and defined, and stood strongly 
as the leader of the household. 
But even then, I couldn’t help 
but imagine her in her world-
renowned role as Pam from “The 
Office” due to the characters’ 
shared use of witty humor and 
quick insults. Alternatively, Oliver 
Hudson was nice to look at, but 
extremely bland and unappealing 
as Martin. For a couple that had 
been married for 10 years, there 
was almost no chemistry between 
the two of them — either romantic 
as ex-lovers or argumentative as 
newly divorced.

“Splitting 
Up 
Together” 

has a seemingly low shelf life, 
considering it is very likely that 
Lena and Martin will eventually 
try to rekindle their relationship. 
Or, at the very least, the series 
is sure to fall into the inevitable 
loop of a “will they, won’t they” 
storyline, which the show will 
frustratingly milk for all it’s 
worth.

“Splitting Up Together” is 

meant to be a comedy, but divorce 
is just not given justice for the 
traumatic event that it is. It’s 
possible the series is meant for 
an older demographic that can 
really identify with the trials 
and tribulations of separation, 
or 
maybe 
divorce 
just 
isn’t 

conventionally 
funny. 
Either 

way, “Splitting Up Together” 
will easily get lost in the flood 
of other network comedies, and 
isn’t worth the hype that Ellen’s 
signature provides.

Pitching, defense shine as ‘M’ extends win streak 

In the sixth inning of the 

Michigan baseball team’s game 
Sunday, freshman outfielder 
Jordan Nwogu miscalculated 
and decided to go for the catch. 
He missed — and crashed into 
the wall, allowing the Delaware 
hitter to secure a double.

In the seventh inning, as 

Michigan held a one-run lead, 
Blue Hens second baseman 
Erik Bowren launched a fly ball 
to deep left field over Nwogu’s 
head. 
This 
time, 
though, 

instead of going for the catch, 
Nwogu played the ball off the 
brick wall and fired a bullet 
to 
junior 
second 
baseman 

Ako Thomas, who tagged the 
runner out.

“When he made that play, I 

thought to myself … the kid who 
showed up here in September 
would’ve never been able to 
make that play,” said Michigan 
coach 
Erik 
Bakich. 
“(In 

September he) would’ve never 

had the arm strength to make 
that play, would have never had 
the savvy to play the ball off the 
wall, like he did.”

Spurred by Nwogu’s big play, 

the Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten, 
16-11 overall) would go on to 
take a 4-2 win over Delaware 
(13-12 overall) and clinch a 
series sweep for the third 
straight weekend.

Nwogu’s play was the epitome 

of 
the 
transformation 
that 

Michigan has experienced ever 
since its 12-game win streak 
began. The defense, which had 
been one of the Wolverines’ 
biggest weaknesses early on, 
appears much improved.

Through March 14, before 

the win streak began, Michigan 
averaged nearly two errors 
a game. During the streak, 
though, the Wolverines are 
averaging just 1.33 errors a 
game.

“You can see them start to 

improvise and (make) some 
really athletic plays,” Bakich 
said. “Early in the year, we 

didn’t have that. We were in 
more of a questioning and a 
doubtful state of mind, unsure 
of (ourselves).

“… We’re still growing, we’re 

still getting better, we’re still 
needing to improve on some 
physical aspects of our game, 
but mentally I really like the 
improvements that we have 
made and that’s gonna be most 
important for this team as we 
continue to move forward.”

The vast improvement in 

defense has opened up other 
aspects 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

game. According to Bakich, the 
defensive growth is a sign of the 
team’s increased confidence.

Freshman right-hander Jeff 

Criswell reaffirmed Bakich’s 
emphasis 
on 
the 
defensive 

improvement 
and 
explained 

that strong play in the field 
helps him as a pitcher.

“One of the most prevalent 

things I think for our team 
is just the solid defense that 
we’ve had,” Criswell said. “Day 
in and day out these guys work 

as hard as they can and it’s 
really showing on the field. It’s 
just been awesome to see. It’s a 
good feeling to have the defense 
back you up and to have trust in 
them because it makes your job 
a lot easier as a pitcher.”

Since the win streak began, 

Michigan’s pitching staff has 
posted a 2.33 team earned run 
average and this weekend saw 
its best overall performance 
yet, as it allowed just two 
earned runs in the three-game 
series.

“It’s just been that over 

and over and over again, guys 
making big pitches and guys 
behind us making big plays,” 
Criswell said. “It’s been a really 
fun thing to be a part of. It’s a 
fun group and I think there’s 
only good things to come.”

If 
the 
Wolverines 
can 

maintain the level of excellence 
their pitching rotation and 
defensive unit have displayed 
over the win streak, they are 
going to be a tough team to beat 
in a fairly weak Big Ten.

Miscues provide Wolverines 

with easy runs against Purdue

Throughout the course of a 

softball game, there are small 
plays that can change the 
outcome of the final score. Elite 
teams find ways to capitalize 
on these opportunities.

On Friday, Purdue second 

baseman 
Stephanie 
Ramsey 

fielded a groundball in the 
fifth 
inning 
from 
junior 

centerfielder Natalie Peters, 
looking to turn a double play. 
On an errant throw, the ball 
deflected 
off 
Boilermaker 

shortstop Halle Hixenbaugh’s 
glove and trickled away toward 
left field. Freshman shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez popped her 
head up to track the ball, saw 
that it was rolling toward the 
outfield and sprinted to third 
base.

This allowed Peters, who had 

reached base on the previous 
play, to steal second –– putting 
two 
runners 
into 
scoring 

position for senior utility player 
Tera Blanco. Blanco took the 
opportunity to drive in both 
runners, increasing Michigan’s 
lead to 4-0.

It was just one instance 

of 
heads-up 
base 
running 

that allowed the Wolverines 
to capitalize on opponents’ 
errors 
and 
create 
scoring 

opportunities.

Over 
the 

weekend, 
Purdue 
committed 
four 
fielding 

errors 
and 

threw 
several 

wild 
pitches, 

contributing 
in part to 21 
total Michigan 
runs. 
In 
the 

first 
inning 

on Friday, the 
Wolverines scored two runs on 
a series of three wild pitches 
which allowed both Blanco and 
Peters to score. Similarly, in 
the first inning of Saturday’s 

game, runners advanced and 
later scored on a wild pitch and 
a passed ball.

“If a team’s gonna give us 

bases, we need to take them,” 
said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “If they’re gonna 
give us balls at the plate, we 
need to take them and take our 
walks. Being on base is critical, 
and we take whatever we can 
get.”

For all the opportunities 

that the Wolverines capitalized 
on, though, there were several 
instances over the weekend 
where they stranded runners 
in scoring position. In the 
three games against Purdue, 
Michigan left a total of 16 
runners on base.

On Friday, three runners 

were 
left 
on 
base 
before 

Blanco’s fifth-inning two-RBI 
single. The opening frame on 
Saturday ended with the bases 
loaded. 
Sunday 
saw 
three 

separate instances in which 
the inning ended with a base 
runner standing on third base, 
before the Wolverines finally 
pulled away.

“We know we have to do a 

better job at that,” said Blanco. 
“And I think that we can even 
score more runs than we did 
this past game. I think we had 
a lot of missed opportunities, 
and it’s something we need to 
get better at this week.”

Against 

a 
team 
like 

Purdue, 
being 

unable to take 
advantage 
of 

an 
opponents’ 

miscues 
may 

not change the 
final result. But 
as 
Michigan 

moves forward 
in Big Ten play 
and 
competes 

against tougher 

opponents, the errors, walks 
and heads-up plays will become 
increasingly important. Failing 
to capitalize on them may come 
back to haunt the Wolverines.

H

eartbreak knows noth-

ing of circum-

There’s 

no sense in 
telling Zavier 
Simpson, 
sulked deep 
into 
his 

locker 
and 

speaking 
in 

a hushed-tone, that his team 
wildly 
outperformed 
any 

expectation this season. Not as 
the team with a trophy was 100 
feet down the hallway.

Duncan Robinson doesn’t 

particularly care that the the 
upstart defensive scheme that 
came to prominence this year 
will pay major dividends down 
the road. That’s no solace for a 
senior who just lost by 17 in his 
last game.

Don’t 
expect 
Charles 

Matthews, draped in a towel 
over his head, to delve deep 
into the bright future ahead of 
a shining beacon of a college 
basketball program. He didn’t 
sit out a year just to ignore the 
here and now.

With 
the 
clock 
winding 

down, a graceful end to a slow, 
painful bludegoning in the 
National Title Game, fifth-year 
senior guard Jaaron Simmons 
could only summon a word to 
describe his emotion.

“Damn.”
The clock read 79-62, an 

anti-climactic 
ending 
to 
a 

season that has been anything 
but.

“At the start of the season 

there’s a probably handful of 
teams, 10 teams, that would say 
‘We need to be in the National 
Title Game,” said assistant 
coach Luke Yaklich.

Michigan was decidedly not 

one of those teams.

But?
“We grew into that team.”
This was a team unranked 

in the preseason, picked tied 
for fifth in the Big Ten and 
labeled as a fringe bubble 
team. This was supposed to be 
a rebuilding season, left to plug 
gaps left by Derrick Walton Jr. 
and DJ Wilson and anxiously 
await next year’s heralded 
recruiting class. 

Instead, 
it 

won a Big Ten 
Tournament and 
came one game 
shy 
of 
taking 

the whole damn 
thing.

“Hell 
nah,” 

Simmons 
said, 

when asked if 
he’s 
thinking 

about preseason 
predictions “Right now, you’re 
thinking, ‘We just lost. It’s 
over. But we knew people didn’t 
expect us to get here. But that 

don’t mean we didn’t expect to 
get here and we didn’t expect 
to win.”

Don’t believe him?
“We 
talked 
about 
being 

National 
Champs 
and 
Big 

Ten champs at our culture 
meeting in July, said assistant 

coach 
Luke 

Yaklich. 
“We 

referenced that 
again 
tonight. 

It’s been on our 
mind. The word 
‘champion’ has 
been 
on 
our 

mind at the start 
of every single 
meeting.

“Just 
40 

minutes short of 

just a perfect ending.”

Monday night, those dreams 

were 
shattered 
by 
Donte 

Divincenzo, 
a 
particularly 

cruel and unforseen way to 
go out. The Villanova guard 
ended 
Michigan’s 
season 

with a 31-point outburst off 
the Wildcats’ bench. Instead 
of national player of the year 
Jalen Brunson or future first-
round pick Mikal Bridges, the 
players in the locker room 
were left answering questions 
about how an Italian guard 
from 
Delaware 
sliced 
and 

diced one of the best defenses 
in the country.

There 
were 
self-inflicted 

wounds, too. It would be 
hard for any team to win 
after 
shooting 
an 
abysmal 

3-for-23 from 3-point range 
and 
allowing 
12 
offensive 

rebounds. There was a time 
midway through the first half 
when it appeared junior center 
Moritz Wagner could carry 
them to glory on his lonesome, 

scoring nine of his team’s first 
11 points, leading Michigan to 
a quick 11-6 advantage.

That hope, though, continued 

to dwindle by the minute, 
with each Divincenzo heave 
and bruising team rebound. 
It was the Wildcats’ night, 
the 
Wildcats’ 

tournament and 
the 
Wildcats’ 

season. 

The 

Wolverines 
can take some 
consolation 
that 
their 

season 
ended 

by 
the 
clear, 

unquestionable 
best team in the 
country, a team that led the 
field beginning to end. but that 
does nothing to ease the harsh, 
momentary pain.

Michigan coach John Beilein 

sniffled as left the locker room 
to head to the podium, eyes red. 
He shared the sentiment of an 
entire locker room, an entire 
university.

There’s a harsh reality of 

an ending to a run — one so 
abrupt and defiant that the 
numbness 
overwhelms 
the 

disappointment. 
It 
won’t 

mask the accomplishments of 
a special team in the bigger 
picture, but for the players in 
the locker room, nine months 
of work doesn’t get properly 
contextualized minutes after 
the buzzer.

There’s reality, a realm in 

which this Michigan team — 
a group threaded together at 
its seams with transfers and 
no-name recruits — came 40 
minutes short of a national title, 
ran into a buzzsaw and finished 
as the national runner-up. 

That’s 
a 
sentence 
that 

would’ve seemed preposterous 
not even a month ago.

“I think that when the pain 

ends, whenever it is for each 
person, I know they’re going 
to look back on this and be 
thankful for the experiences 
they 
had,” 
Yaklich 
said, 

“the relationships that were 
developed, all of the wins, 
all of the losses, just the time 
together. 

“They’ll all get to that point 

when they need 
to.”

There’s 
no 

room 
in 
the 

Michigan 
locker 
room 

for 
that 
right 

now, 
though. 

Not while the 
wounds are still 
fresh.

Only tears.

The reality that will haunt Michigan

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — 

As with everything in the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

program, John Beilein preaches 
a precise routine. For freshman 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers, 
that 

means talking to his dad prior to 
every game.

So on Monday, Livers told 

his dad how he needed to 
be aggressive, how he could 
attempt to stifle his matchup, 
how 
he 
wanted 
to 
take 

smart shots on offense. And 
naturally, 
Livers 
articulated 

his excitement to play in the 
national championship game 
— a dream for every college 
basketball player but a reality 
for a select few.

Yet there was a sobering tone 

of realism in his words.

“We’ve got to play like our 

old self,” Livers told his dad. 
“We got to pick it up. We haven’t 
played our best basketball in a 
while.”

When Michigan took the floor 

in San Antonio, it’d been exactly 
30 days since it won the Big Ten 
Tournament 
Championship. 

There, 
it 
looked 
nearly 

unbeatable 
with 
convincing 

victories over Michigan State 
and Purdue.

But the Wolverines would 

soon begin to flirt with death 
like a bad habit. They were 
dreadfully 
sluggish 
in 
the 

opening round of the NCAA 
Tournament. Jordan Poole saved 
them with a miracle in the next 
round. A less-talented Florida 
State club nearly bit them in Los 
Angeles. Moritz Wagner needed 
the game of his life to knock off 
Loyola-Chicago.

Excluding 
an 
anomalous 

barrage against Texas A&M, 
Michigan had been shooting 
3-pointers at just 25 percent 
during the tournament. Defense 
and luck — having playing no 

team seeded higher than sixth 
until 
Monday 

— had carried 
the 
Wolverines 

through 
their 

rough 
shooting 

performances.

“We’ve 

noticed that our 
shooting 
was 

not to where it 
normally is, that 
was 
clear 
the 

last two games 
especially,” 
said 
freshman 

guard C.J. Baird.

All of this, of course, is part 

of basketball. No team is always 

going to play its best.

But Monday’s 

20-point loss to 
Villanova 
was 

one 
that 
was 

coming.

The 

Wolverines had 
another dreadful 
shooting 
performance, 
going just 3-of-
23 from beyond-
the-arc. 
Their 

offense settled far too often. 
The rim was rarely kind.

“I couldn’t tell you (why),” 

Baird said. “I mean every day, 

those guys are raining 3s on us 
in practice.”

And yet, there were aspects 

of 
Michigan’s 
game 
that 

unexpectedly underperformed.

Michigan’s perimeter defense 

had been exceptional all-season 
long. 
On 
Monday, 
Yaklich’s 

magic number was eight — 
that, or less, was how many 
3-pointers he told his defense it 
could allow to win.

The 
Wildcats, 
even 
after 

starting 1-of-9, hit 10. 

“We 
(knew 
we 
had) 
to 

be 
incredibly 
connected 

defensively, the whole night,” 
Yakich said. “You can’t let your 

guard down.”

Villanova ran 

the 
definition 

of a blitzkrieg 
offense. 
Even 

when 
the 

Wildcats 
seem 

off-base like they 
did early, they 
strike before you 
know it. It’s what 
led 
Villanova 

to one of the 
most 
dominant 

tournament runs of all time, and 
it’s what led them to a 17-point 
win over Michigan on a night 
when its best player in Jalen 

Brunson struggled immensely.

That’s 
why 
defensive 

rebounding, a significant source 
of improvement this season, was 
so critial for Michigan. But the 
Wolverines allowed 12 offensive 
boards, killing any momentum 
and hope they had at coming 
back.

“The biggest surprise was our 

lack of defensive rebounding,” 
Yakich said. “That was just 
surprising. 
… 
If 
you’d 
had 

said we’d give up 12 offensive 
rebounds tonight I’d probably 
have said we’re in trouble.”

But perhaps what nobody 

could 
have 
expect 
was 

the 
performance 
of 
Donte 

DiVincenzo. 
He’s 
the 
sixth 

option in Villanova’s offense, 
averaging 13.5 points per game. 
He lit up Michigan for 31.

“He killed us for sure,” said 

redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Charles Matthews. “He wasn’t 
their main option, but he showed 
up on the big stage, and I got to 
say I respect it.”

Added 
Livers: 
“When 

someone’s on fire you got to deny 
him. I know we tried our best, 
but I don’t think we did what 
we’re capable of shutting a player 
down. That doesn’t happen a lot.”

What had been happening a 

lot, however, were Michigan’s 
sub-par 
offensive 
showings. 

And when those are combined 

with rebounding 
lapse, 
a 

DiVincenzo 
blaze 
and 
an 

overall 
brilliant 

Wildcats’ 
team, 
they’re 

compounded into 
the blowout you’d 
expect.

Of course, it 

was a blowout 
that 
the 

Wolverines weren’t expecting. 
And that’s the reality that they’ll 
have to deal with as they turn the 
page on this season.

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman’s final exit

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — 

The walk between the bench 
to the Alamodome tunnel is 
as lonely as it is visible. After 
stepping up to the court and 
walking across it, it takes 
another 70 steps to leave — an 
expansive walk on the carpet 
with an unobstructed view 
around the arena until step No. 
71.

That 
was 
the 
route 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman 
took, 
jogging 

behind his teammates as they 
exited. In the final game of 
the senior guard’s career — a 
79-62 drubbing at the hands 
of Villanova in the National 
Championship game — all he 
could do was stroll, stone-
faced, off the court for the last 
time in a Michigan uniform.

Nobody imagined his team 

would make it this far. The 
team’s 
accomplishments, 

including a program-best 33-8 
record, didn’t make the defeat 
any less painful.

“You don’t think about it 

much right now because of the 
way we lost,” Abdur-Rahkman 
said. “But nobody had us here. 
Lost a couple guys to the NBA, a 
lot of new faces and we weren’t 
picked to be one of the top 
teams in the Big Ten. We went 
out there and proved them 
wrong from the beginning of 
the season to the end.”

Despite the results, Abdur-

Rahkman did what a senior 
and team captain should do 
on the biggest stage — the 
perfect goodbye to one of the 
quietest players to rank in 
Michigan lore. In the first 
half of Monday night’s tilt he 
finished a transition layup, 
knocked down a 3-pointer and 
finessed his way to two more 
easy layups and a free throw 
for 10 points. The captain 
even showed uncharacteristic 
emotion, hoisting up three 
fingers and pounding his chest 

after his triple.

Then he was substituted out 

after earning his second foul 
with 4:07 remaining, and the 
wheels came irreversibly off 
for 
Michigan. 

Wildcat 
guard 
Donte 

Divincenzo 
exploded for 31 
points, draining 
shots 
every 

which 
way. 

When Villanova 
wasn’t scoring, 
the Wolverines 
committed 
one foul after 
another.

Abdur-Rahkman 
was 
the 

lone 
constant. 
The 
6-foot-

4 guard stayed aggressive, 
driving to the rim for points 
three 
separate 
times 
and 

hitting one crossover trey as 
part of his team-high 23 points 
on 8-for-13 shooting. The game 
was out of reach, but Abdur-
Rahkman played like someone 

who knew it was 
his last game.

“It’s 
a 

testament to his 
heart, the type 
of person he is,” 
said sophomore 
guard 
Ibi 

Watson. 
“Unfortunately, 
it 
was 
kinda 

overshadowed 
by our loss. But 

it just shows how he is as a 
person. He never gives up and 
he has such a great will.

“It’s something that’s rubbed 

off on all of us, and he’s a great 
example of what it’s like to be a 

Michigan man.”

With 1:10 remaining, Abdur-

Rahkman checked out for the 
final time and embraced John 
Beilein. It wasn’t long after 
he lined up last for post-game 
handshakes 
and 
made 
his 

contemplative jog out of the 
arena. But he wasn’t thinking 
about the future — it was time 
to be a captain one more time 
and impart his wisdom on his 
teammates.

“I just wanted to say how 

proud I am of this team,” 
Abdur-Rahkman said. “Being 
the captain, I had my hand 
in a lot of things and a lot of 
people’s growth. We wanted to 
see people grow and pass stuff 
on to the younger guys.”

Added 
freshman 
guard 

Jordan Poole when asked about 
Abdur-Rahkman’s leadership: 

“That’s big bro, straight like 
that. We done been through 
so much. I didn’t really talk 
to him at the beginning of the 
year because I was tryna feel 
him out, but now 
we talk everyday. 
Being 
able 
to 

be 
around 
that 

type of guy — he 
just has so much 
knowledge, 
he’s 

like 27 years old.”

So what comes 

next for the senior, 
who 
is 
actually 

just 23 years old?

Earlier 
in 

the 
season, 
Beilein 
called 

Abdur-Rahkman a guy who 
practices solely to improve, 
not to make the jump to a more 
competitive league. Pursuing a 
professional basketball career 

is not something that he’s ever 
spoken about publicly. Not 
even his teammates know.

“Muhammad’s not like that,” 

said freshman forward Isaiah 
Livers. “He’s gonna make a 
decision on his own and that’s 
what I like most about him. 
But he hasn’t told me about 
it. … It’s not (his) last game of 
basketball, I do believe that.”

The 
“silent 
assassin” 

as 
assistant 
coach 
Saddi 

Washington calls him, is just 
that 
— 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 

quiet imprint includes one of 
the most polished resumes in 
program history. A national 
championship appearance, two 
Big Ten Tournament titles, 
a Sweet Sixteen finish, 1,283 
career points and a program 
record for most games played. 

Abdur-Rahkman was never 

one to make light of that, of 
course. It’s not in the DNA 
of someone who came in as 
a two-star recruit and who 
was thrusted into the starting 
lineup his freshman year to do 
that. His legacy is as powerful 
as it is predictable.

“Do your work in silence,” 

Livers 
remarked 
of 
what 

Abdur-Rahkman 
taught 

him. “You don’t see Duncan 
(Robinson) and Muhammad 
flaunting about all the work 
they’ve put in. They don’t say 
anything about that at all. 

… 
I 
haven’t 

told 
them 

this yet that 
I 
appreciate 

how 
much 

work they’ve 
put 
in 

even 
when 

nobody’s 
looking.”

But 
after 

Monday 
night’s 
loss, 

Abdur-Rahkman 
couldn’t 

escape the 67,831 person crowd 
as he walked off the court for 
the final time. He’s now a 
part of Michigan basketball 
history.
