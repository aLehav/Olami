Notoriously tough interviewer def ined an age of broadcast news Fellows honor Wallace's legacy

STEVE ZOSKI
Daily News Editor and Daily Staff
Reporters
Pioneering broadcast jour-
nalist Mike Wallace, a Univer-
sity alum and former Michigan
Daily reporter, best known for
his scathing interviews on the
CBS News program "60 Min-
utes," died Saturday in New
Cannan, Conn. Wallace was 93.
Wallace graduated from the
University in 1939, but he long

remained connected to Ann
Arbor. He endowed an inves-
tigative reporting fellowship
to the Knight-Wallace fellow-
ship - a year-long program for
mid-career journalists to study
at the University - and donat-
ed the fellows' residence at 620
Oxford Road, which is filled
with memorabilia and awards
from his six-decade long career.
Wallace also worked at the
University's radio station, and
after graduating he reported
for news radio station WOOD-
WASH in Grand Rapids, and

later at WXYZ in Detroit.
Known for being an excep-
tionally tough interviewer,
Wallace was one of the jour-
nalists who helped launch
"60 Minutes" in 1968. Wallace
formally retired from the pro-
gram in 2006 to become a "cor-
respondent emeritus." He did
many major interviews in this
role, including his last appear-
ance on the venerable news
magazine show in January
2008, in the first public inter-
view of former Major League
Baseball pitcher Roger Clem-

ens after a report suggested he
used performance-enhancing
drugs.
Wallace has interviewed
many notable figures, includ-
ing Jack Kevorkian - a famous
doctor and University alum
who was imprisoned for assist-
ing individuals in committing
suicide. Oakland County pros-
ecutors used his interview with
Kevorkian during a trial that
resulted in the doctor's even-
tual imprisonment for second-
degree murder.

While others were celebrating
Easter or Passover yesterday, the
University Knight-Wallace fellows
gathered with their families and
co-workers to watch video clips in
honor of the late namesake of their
fellowship program, Mike Wal-
lace, who passed away at 93 in New
Canaan, Connecticut yesterday.
Wallace - a University alum
and renowned broadcast journal-
ist known most prominently for his
work on CBS' "60 Minutes" - and

his wife Mary donated the home to
the University in 1992. The build-
ing houses offices, weekly seminars
and other events for members of
the fellowship, designed for mid-
career journalists to study at the
University. Though the house for-
mally stands asa workplace for the
fellows, the group gathered there
yesterday to celebrate the esteemed
newsman and reflect upon his
influential work.
Charles Eisendrath, director
of the Knight-Wallace Fellows
at Michigan, said Wallace's most

Pi Kappa Phi
holds dinner to
raise awareness
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
At the second annual
Empathy dinner on Friday
night, a group of Pi Kappa
Phi fraternity brothers were
bound, blindfolded or given
earplugs as their brothers
aided them through the meal,
as part of an effort to simu-
late the day-to-day struggles
that students with disabilities
face.
At the end of the dinner,
LSA junior Lars Johnson,
philanthropy chair for Pi
Kappa Phi, announced that
throughout the year, the fra-
ternity raised $875 to donate
to the Ann Arbor Center for
Independent Living, a local
nonprofit organization that
aims to provide support and
services to people in the com-
munity with disabilities.
According to Johnson, Pi

Kappa Phi also typically rais-
es more than $7,000 a year for
their national philanthropic
organization Push America -
which aims to enrich the lives
of people with disabilities -
as well as additional money
for local organizations, such
as the Ann Arbor Center for
Independent living.
Jill Rice, coordinator of
services for deaf and hard-
of-hearing students at the
University, gave a presenta-
tion about challenges Univer-
sity students with disabilities
face as well as services the
University provides for those
students.
Rice said she, estimated
there are about 2,700 students
with disabilities at the Uni-
versity, but only 1,700 actually
registered with the .Services
for Students with Disabilities
branch oftheUniversity's stu-
dent affairs office.
In an interview before her
presentation, Rice said she
was very impressed with the
idea of giving people a chance
to see what it's like to have a
disability.

Banned Islamic

An Islamic activist in Israel
who entered Britain despite

Islamic Movement in Israel
leader Sheikh Raed Salah flew
to Britain in June, despite an
brder from Home Secretary
Theresa May banning him over
his political activities. He was

And released on bail.
The Palestine Solidarity Cam-

received a letter from Britain's

"entirely unnecessary" and that
his appeal has succeeded "on all
grounds."
Britain's Home Office said
that it was "disappointed" with
the tribunals decision. "We are
considering the detailed judg-
ment and if we can appeal, we
will," it said in a statement.
Salah's legal team claimed he
had not been aware of the ban,

had entered the country with a

had made "no attempt" to con-
ceal his identity.

Three shot to death
in Oklahoma, race
a suspected factor

AN HYOUNG-JOON/AP
South Korean activists rally against North Korea's proposed satellite launch to honor late President Kim II Sung's birth.
North Korea readies long-range
rocket despite international ban

Officials claim
reasons for
pending launch are
peaceful
TONGCHANG-RI, North
Korea (AP) - North Korean
space officials have moved all
three stages of a long-range
rocket into position for a con-
troversial launch, vowing yes-
terday to push ahead with their
plan in defiance of international
warnings against violating a
ban on missile activity.
North Korea announced
plans last month to launch an
observation satellite using a
three-stage rocket during mid-
April celebrations of the 100th
anniversary of the birth of
North Korean founder Kim II
Sung. The U.S., Japan, Britain
and other nations have urged
North Korea to cancel the

launch, warning that firing the
long-range rocket would vio-
late U.N. resolutions and North
Korea's promise to refrain from
engaging in nuclear and missile
activity.
North Korea maintains
that the launch is a scien-
tific achievement intended to
improve the nation's faltering
economy by providing detailed
surveys of the countryside.
"Our country has the right
and also the obligation to devel-
op satellites and launchingvehi-
cles," Jang Myong Jin, general
manager of the launch facility,
said during a tour, citing the
U.N. space treaty. "No matter
what others say, we are doing
this for peaceful purposes."
Experts say the Unha-3
rocket slated for liftoff between
April 12 and 16 could also test
long-range missile technology
that might be used to strike the
U.S. and other targets.
North Korea has tested

two atomic devices, but is not
believed to have mastered the
technology needed to mount a
warhead on a long-range mis-
sile.
Yesterday, reporters were
taken by train past desolate
fields and sleepy farming ham-
lets to North Korea's new launch
pad in Tongchang-ri in North
Phyongan province, about 35
miles south of the border town
of Sinuiju along North Korea's
west coast.
All three stages of the 91-ton
rocket, emblazoned with the
North Korean flag and "Unha-
3," were visibly in position at
the towering launch pad, and
fueling will begin soon, Jang
said. He said preparations were
well on track for liftoff and that
international space, aviation
and maritime authorities had
been advised of the plan, but
did not provide exact details on
the timing of the fueling or the
mounting of the satellite.

Authorities say
revenge may have
motivated the
shootings
TULSA, Okla. (AP) - Two
men were arrested yesterday
in a shooting rampage that left
three people dead and terrorized
Tulsa's black community, and
police said one suspect may have
been trying to avenge his father's
shootingtwoyears agobyablack
man.
Police identified both suspects
as white, while all five victims in
the rampage early Friday were
black.
Police and the FBI said it is too
soon to say whether the attacks
in Tulsa's predominantly black
north side were racially moti-
vated. Police spokesman Jason
Willingham said that investi-
gators are considering many
possible motives but based on
Facebook postings, revenge
appeared to be a factor.
In a Thursday update on
Facebook that appeared to have
been written by 19-year-old Jake
England, he angrily blamed his
father's death on a black man
and used a racial slur. He said
Thursday was the second anni-
versary of his father's death.
"It's hard not to go off," given
the anniversary and the death of
his fiancee earlier this year, the
posting said.
"It's apparent from the post-
ing on the Facebook page that
he had an ax to grind, and that
was possibly part of the motive,"
Willingham said. "If you read
the Facebook post and see what
he's accused of doing, you can
see there's link between the two
of them."
The Facebook page had been
taken down by yesterday after-
noon.
A family friend, Susan Seven-.
star, told The Associated Press
that England was "a good kid"
and "a good, hard worker," who
"was not in his right mind" after
losing his father and the Janu-
ary suicide of his fiancee, with
whom he'd recently had a baby.
"If anybody is trying to say
this is a racial situation, they've
got things confused," said Sev-
enstar, who described England
as Cherokee Indian. "He didn't
care what your color was. It
wasn't a racist thing."
The Tulsa World reported
that England's father, Carl, was
shot in the chest during a scuf-
fle with a man who had tried to
break into his daughter's apart-
ment. England later died.
The man chargedintheshoot-

ing is serving a six-year sentence
on a weapons charge, according
to Department of Corrections
records.
Acting on an anonymous
tip and backed by a helicopter,
police arrested Jake England
and Alvin Watts, 32, about 2
a.m. yesterday at a home in
Turley, just north of Tulsa. The
two men were roommates, and
officers went to their home, then
followed them several blocks to
another home, where they were
arrested without incident, police
said.
Authorities said they planned
to charge them with murder and
other offenses. Task force com-
mander Maj. Walter Evans said
that investigators recovered a
weapon but that it was not clear
who fired the shots. They also
found a truck that had been
burned.
Police previously said they
were looking for aman in a white
truck.
The Rev. Warren Blakney Sr.,
president of the Tulsa NAACP,
said the arrests came as a big
relief. Black community leaders
had met Friday night amid fear
over the shootings and concerns
about possible vigilantism in
retaliation.
"The community once again
can go about its business with-
out fear of there being a shooter
on the streets on today, on Easter
morning," Blakney said.
It was not immediately known
if the suspects had lawyers.
Police Chief Chuck Jordan
said the gunmen appeared to
have chosen their victims at
random. Police identified those
killed as Dannaer Fields, 49,
Bobby Clark, 54, and William
Allen, 31. Two men were wound-
ed but were released from the
hospital, Jordan said.
The shootings come at a
fraught moment for black
Americans. In late February, an
-unarmed black teen, Trayvon
Martin, was fatally shot by a
neighborhood watch volunteer
in Sanford, Florida, raising
questions about racial profiling
and touching off protests across
the nation.
While Tulsa police were
reluctant to describe the shoot-
ings there as racially motivated,
City Councilman Jack Hender-
son was not.
"Being an NAACP president
for seven years, I think that
somebody that committed these
crimes were very upset with
black people," Henderson said.
"That person happened to be a
white person, the people they
happened to kill and shoot are
black people. That fits the bill for
me."

After controversial-poem, Israel
bars German author Guenter Grass

Nobel-winner was
drafted by Nazis in
World War II
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
yesterday declared Guenter
Grass persona non grata, deep-
ening a spat with the Nobel-
winning author over a poem
that deeply criticized the Jew-
ish state and suggested it was as
much a danger as Iran.
The dispute with Grass, who
only late in life admitted to a
Nazi past, has drawn new atten-
tion to strains in Germany's
complicated relationship with

the Jewish state - and also was drafted into the Waffen-SS

Advantageous autonomy

Self-governed schools have potential for Detroit and college students intern-
ing without pay at a non-profit

n the face of massive budget deficits and consistently declining
enrollment, Detroit Public Schools unveiled its next step toward
solvency. Last Wednesday, Roy Roberts, the DPS state-appointed
emergency manager, unveiled the DPS 2012-13 Action Plans, which
include fairly sweeping changes to the system. Besides closing 16
buildings and transferring 15 schools -'those in the bottom 5 percent
for performance - to the state's newly created Educational Achieve-
ment System, the plan gives unparalleled self-governance to 10 well-
performing schools - a "hybrid" system of school and district control.
This aspect of the plan has the potential to empower communities,
provide improved education and play a role in reducing the district's
deficit. The autonomy system is an innovative potential solution to
some of DPS's woes, but self-determination and community involve-
ment must be fostered district-wide.

A five-member board in charge of the major-
ity of available funds, operations and hiring
will control the 10 self-governing schools. The
five-member board is made up of a represen-
tative of parents, a business professional and
three others selected by DPS. The move would
affect about 7,500 students starting in the fall,
according to DPS's website.
The introduction of this self-governing sys-
tem has positive potential by increasing focus
on parents and principals and moving away
from one-size-fits-all mandates. Standardized
measures of control have proven ineffective -
No Child Left Behind comes to mind. Allowing
schools to have increased control gives them
the opportunity to individualize many aspects
specific to their community. Thus, students
are encouraged to stay in their neighborhoods.
The plan is innovative in a-district in desperate
need of innovation. It provides direct input and
accountability for parents, business leaders
and the community.
The selection of five board members -
especially the selection of the business leader
- must be a very careful procedure. It seems
counterintuitive to give the majority of control
to DPS' selections, so these council members
must remain focused on the specific school.
This independence runs the risk of schools'
priorities shifting to business interests and
budgets rather than education.

The parent member of the board is pos-
sibly the most encouraging aspect of the self-
governance plan. Though getting parents to
work with the schools can be difficult, foster-
ing parent involvement and action within their
kid's schooling is vital and has been lacking in
Detroit's public schools. The input of parents
provides an important influence on schools'
operations and is crucial for helping schools
move in the right direction. Allowing parents
to influence schools on a neighborhood-by-
neighborhood basis will provide specific and
useful input.
DPS must also retain focus on schools
beyond the 10 in the pilot program, and the
Action Plans do address many other hindrances
to students' success. The self-run schools must
sign a performance contract with DPS, adher-
ing to certain provisions including a pledge for
a 99 percent graduation rate. This figure is cur-
rently impossible for many of Detroit's schools.
However, if this system is successful at the
initial 10 schools, aspects of self-governance
should be expanded across the district.
Self-governance is an innovative way to
make schools stand closer with their commu-
nity so students receive better education. At
the same time, the selection of board members
must be thorough to ensure the plan not only
achieves greater specificity, but better educa-
tion and enhanced graduation rates.

community ser-
vice group last
summer. On a
handful of occa-
sions, the interns
outnumbered
the volunteers
we supposedly
supervised doing
various projects ANDREW
in Detroit. Had WEINER
the organiza-
tion written a
job description, it would have read,
"Do nothing." So, we labored along-
side the volunteers - devoid of any
real responsibility. With little intern
work to do, why did they hire so
many bodies?
Why not?
Parents have a rosy, innocent pic-
ture of internships in their mind -
painted with tenured professionals
and mentors, invaluable knowledge
and career-enhancing networking
for their children.
Employers, however, increasingly
view internships more nefariously as
free labor. Students, more depress-
ingly, see them as mere points on a
rdsumd.
Overthelastseveral months,when
summer internship applications are
typically due, it's not uncommon to
overhear students' remarks along
the lines of, "I'll sweep floors, I'll
get coffee, I'll seduce and poison the
CEO of a competing firm. I don't care
as long as it's an internship."
In today's job market, it's not
difficult to understand this mind-
set. Since 2008, fewer students are
graduating from colleges with jobs
already in hand. A 2011 The New
York Times article reported that
only 56 percent of the class of 2010
had at least one job by spring of the
next year - a drastic drop from 90
percent in 2006. Fear not - it gets
bleaker. Of those employed, only half
of the jobs required degrees.
The pressure to pad your resum6
- that one sheet of paper that acts
as your introduction to potential
employers - is intensifying. For
those who aren't titling themselves
"Nourishment Specialist" for baking

cupcakes for a club, internships are
essentially mandatory. Things aren't
looking cheery - perhaps you'd be
crazy not to jump on an opportunity
to sweep a law firm's floors.
Studies are supporting student's
suspicions. A 1992 study by North-
western University found only 17
percent of students had internship
experience. The National Asso-
ciation of Colleges and Employers
annually surveys 50,000 students
from 559 colleges, including the
University of Michigan. In its 2012
report, they found more than half
of the students "had an internship
or co-op experience." Quite a differ-
ence in 15 years.
Unfortunately, the ratio has shift-
ed toward more unpaid internships
in recent years - about half of those
surveyed by NACE didn't receive
compensation. While some busi-
nesses are struggling alongside the
rest of the country, more are looking
for people to do work for their com-
panies free of charge - extorting
desperation for profit.
The role of interns becoming
unpaid custodians and baristas isn't
new, and is almost institutionalized
in the country. However, unpaid
interns performing these tasks are
technically prohibited under the
Fair Labor Standards Act.
In response to several states
beginning to crack down on abus-
es, in 2010 the U.S. Department of
Labor issued a reminder to employ-
ers, which included the six factors
the department uses to determine
the legality of unpaid internships.
The first four are especially relevant:
the training must be similar to voca-
tional or academic instruction; it
must benefit the intern; the intern
cannot replace a paid employee; and
the employer doesn't receive any
"immediate advantage" from the
intern's work.
If the guidelines were followed
strictly, nearly every unpaid intern-
ship would be in jeopardy, but the
Dept. of Labor regulations seem
illogical. Couldn't an employer pay
an employee to do any task an intern
might perform? Shouldn't the rela-
tionship be mutually beneficial if the
intern excels and contributes new
ideas? Isn't hands-on training more

beneficial than passive observation?
The guidelines were based on a
1947 Supreme Court decision, Wall-
ing v. Portland Terminal Co., and
relate more to blue-collar training.
In effect,they're outdated and there-
fore ignored.
Unpaid positions
technically
violate labor laws.
Regardless, it's unethical for
employers to expect interns to hem-
orrhage thousands of dollars living
in New York or D.C. sweeping floors
in exchange for a resume line. The
steep price tag of unpaid internships
away from home creates a quasi-
elitist system. For many students,
accepting an unpaid position isn't
financially feasible. As a result, those
who can afford them have the resu-
mes to prove it.
Besides increased employer con-
science, universities should be part
of the solution. They should create
more programs like the Universi-
ty's Public Service Intern Program.
PSIP guides students looking for
internships in Washington, D.C.,
and creates blacklists of organiza-
tions past-year's students have had
negative experiences with. Secondly,
to address the increasing number
of unpaid positions, colleges can
increase fellowships to finance an
unpaid experience - -especially
those in the social sciences, where
less funding exists. Most impor-
tantly, colleges need to simplify and
expand means for turning intern-
ships into credit hours.
On top of what colleges can do,
students should weigh the benefits
of speaking up if compensation is
deserved - a risky move to take.
But, I can't imagine I'll bring that
up when my bosses ask me to run to
Starbucks this summer. Cream and
sugar?

Healthpreform must go further

Keep your brain on standby

W hen we were young, the
onset of summer offered
us the chance to "turn

Last week, The Michigan Daily published
an editorial that ended with the telling obser-
vation that the United States spends "more
than any other developed nation" on health
care, yet ranks "37th out of about 191 nations"
in "overall healthcare quality." While the poor
cost-quality ratio of American medical care
is troubling, it's unlikely that the changes
implemented by President Barack Obama's
Affordable Care Act will have maximal effect
without a few added considerations.
For one, the Affordable Care Act doesn't
address the potential savings promised by the
use of comparative effectiveness; research in
the national health care system. Compara-
tive effectiveness refers to a process by which
statisticians compare several forms of treat-
ment for the same illness. Some treatment
methods vary widely in cost yet are strikingly
similar in their ultimate outcomes. A 2009
New Yorker investigative piece focused on the
town of McAllen, Texas, which has the most
expensive healthcare costs in the country. The
article discussed the widespread practice of
"overutilizatin," in which doctors adminis-
ter multiple unnecessary tests - sometimes to
get more money out of a patient, other times
to prevent the slightest possibility of a lawsuit
- that basically amounts to sanctioned fraud.
By "sanctioned," I'm referring to the fact
that our current health care industry is
exploiting our trust in the old maxim "you
get what you pay for." According to the New
Yorker article's primary research, "the more
money Medicare spent per person in a given
state the lower that state's quality ranking
tend(s) tobe." The article also draws from out-
side research to posit that oftentimes, patients
in costlier areas of the country "d(o) no bet-

ter than other patients, whether this was
measured in terms of survival, their ability
to function, or satisfaction with the care they
received."
Since the current healthcare system com-
pensates practitioners under a "fee-for-
service" system rather than with an annual
salary, there's an inherent motivation to test
a patient to death, racking up charges that
have no measurable effect on the outcome of
the treatment method. I never thought I'd say
this, but given these conditions, it's hard not
to equate America's medical practice with its
cell-phone industry.
Though there's a provision in the Afford-
able Care Act for a pilot program that would
address the varying expenses of Medicare
coverage by region, there's no guarantee it'll
catch on as a long-term strategy. Furthermore,
the act does little to eliminate the overhead
costs incurred through the unnecessary medi-
ation of third-party insurance companies.
A single-payer universal healthcare system
would maximize savings, if not by eliminating
wasteful practices, then at least by limitingthe
waste to a single source of healthcare ration-
ing - the federal government.
Obama's healthcare reforms may be a
step in the right direction, but they're not
the long-term solution Americans have been
looking for. It'd be best to view it as a bridge
between the old system and a comprehensive
new one, in which everyone receives treat-
ment relative to their lifestyle choices and
a contribution proportional to their income
level, rationed out by a single pool of health
care investments.

earned R&R.
College is no different. Each year
it's easy to see that students, having
endured a long Michigan winter, are
hungry for some sun.
It's a cruel irony that the nicest
weather of the year comes hand in
hand with the busiest time of the
semester. The temperature rises? It
must be time for midterms. The trees
are flowering on South University?
Finals are just around the corner.
Let's face it. When the sun comes
out, it's easy to put work on the back-
burner. By the time summer break
rolls around, we're ready to take a
break - to "turn off" our brains until
autumn.
Unfortunately, the arrival of sum-
mer doesn't mean the Earth stops
spinning. The lazy haze that settles
in with the heat doesn't keep politi-
cians from saying crazy things, wars
from being fought or crimes from
being committed.
In the absence of schoolwork, it's

tempting for students to shut down
their minds. But I'd like to make the
case forkeepingthem switched on -
or, at the very least, on standby.
Here are some topics that will
matter the most this summer:
" The 2012 presidential election
- As Mitt Romney wins the Repub-
lican nomination (I see no scenario
in which that doesn't happen) how
will President Barack Obama per-
form in his bid for re-election? Will
political discourse become any more
civilized?
Iran - Will Israel preemptively
attack Iranian nuclear facilities?
Will the United States be drawn into
another war in the Middle East?
- European economic crisis - Will
leaders in Europe overcome the con-
tinent's dire economic conditions? A
weak European economy is arguably
one of the greatest threats to Ameri-
can national security.
" Healthcare reform - Will the
Supreme Court uphold the constitu-
tionality of the Affordable Care Act?
" Michigan - Recently, the Dem-
ocrats in the state legislature sued
the GOP for bypassing the consti-
tutionally-mandated two-thirds
majority needed in order to give
legislation "immediate effect." The
controversy has gained attention in
the national media. For a nice run-
down of the specifics, see MSNBC
host Rachel Maddow's recent seg-
ment on the issue. (Also, don't tell
me that Maddow is the left-wing
equivalent of Fox News. She puts
her own beliefs on display, certain-

stops turning.

These, among other unforeseen
developments, will likely occupy
headlines in the coming months. If
we switch off our brains, will we be
ready to meet the long-term chal-
lenges that these issues present?
Our minds can't operate with-
out rest. Even I, a self-declared
news junkie, need a break from the
absurdity of politics now and then.
But that doesn't make it accept-
able for us to disregard important
developments entirely. During the
summer months, the opposite holds
true: as students, we must keep our
capacity for critical thinking close
at hand. When the sun comes out,
don't stay inside and keep your eyes
glued to the television screen. But
when something newsworthy makes
waves, don't let yourself get caught
off guard.
Keep tabs on the pulse of politics
- keep your brain on standby. When
we return to campus in the fall,
you'll be glad you did.

WALLACE
From Page 1A
Wallace began the "ambush"
interview, in which he present-
ed his subjects with otherwise
unknown evidence of wrongful
acts theyhad committed. Wallace
later admitted that such tactics
were more to create attractive
TV rather than good journalism.
Wallace was the subject of
several libel suits, which endan-
gered his career and reportedly
caused him much stress, even-
tually driving him into clinical
depression.
Wallace earned 21 Emmy
Awards, five DuPont-Columbia
journalism awards, five Pea-
body awards and the Paul White
Award, the most prestigious
award given by the Radio and
Television News Directors Asso-
ciation. He also won the Robert
F. Kennedy Journalism Award
grand prize and television first
prize in 1996, and was inducted
into the Television Academy
Hall of Fame in June 1991.
Yesterday morning, Jeff Fager,
chairman of CBS News and exec-
utive producer of "60 Minutes,"
said in a statement that Wallace
was critical to the formation of
"60 Minutes."
"There simply hasn't been
another broadcast journalist
with that much talent," Fager
said. "It almost didn't matter
what stories he was covering,
you just wanted to hear what he
would ask next. Around CBS he
was the same infectious, funny
and ferocious person as he was
on TV. We loved him and we will
miss him very much."
CBS News producer Don
Hewitt picked Wallace for the

program in 1968 because of his
"hard-charging" style, according
to the release.
"Wallace was as famous as the
leaders, newsmakers and celeb-
rities who suffered his blistering
interrogations, winning awards
and a reputation for digging
out the hidden truth on Sunday
nights in front of an audience
that approached 40 million at
broadcast television's peak," the
release read.
Harry Reasoner, Wallace's
original partner on "60 Minutes"
who died in 1991, said Wallace's
interviewing abilities were one-
of-a-kind.
"There is one thing that Mike
can do better than anybody else:
With an angelic smile, he can ask
a question that would get anyone
else smashed in the face," Rea-
soner said before his death.
During Wallace's time on "60
Minutes," the show spent 23 sea-
sons on the Nielsen top 10 list,
including five seasons as the
number one rated program.
A front-page article in the
April 7, 1938 edition of The
Michigan Daily announced that
CBS hired Wallace to join its
radio broadcast team. According
to the news brief, Wallace's "cul-
tured tones" and tasteful use of
emotion in his stories helped him
beat out his peers in his broad-
casting classes for the coveted
job. The Daily cited a telegram
from Wallace to his parents
announcing his appointment.
"Announcing Columbia net-
work Thursday 4:15. Whee!,"
Wallace wrote in the telegram.
"No radio station WHEE in
Boston. Please explain," his par-
ents wrote back.
Wallace also spoke at the Uni-
versity's 1987 Spring Commence-

ment, delivering an address to
graduates on racism and intoler-
ance.
"Here on this university island
in which you've lived these last
few years, you are about as sensi-
tive, as pure probably, as you will
ever be in all your lives," Wal-
lace said. "Your minds are open,
you've been stretching them,
learning more about yourselves
and others, other societies, other
struggles, other notions of ful-
fillment, other ideas."
Wallace's speech came despite
protests over a remark he made
in 1981 while conducting an on-
air interview regarding faulty
housing contracts that were
signed by Black and Hispanic
Californians.
"You bet your ass they're hard
to read if you're reading from
over watermelons and tacos,"
Wallace said in the interview.
At the 1987 commencement, a
group of graduates turned their
back to Wallace wearing signs
on their robes that said "Anti-
Apartheid Commencement."
Wallace addressed the risque
remark in his commencement
address.
"(Bigotry is) an easy out. It can
be downright comforting to feel
bigger, better, than the next fel-
low," Wallace said. "Your sense
of injustice will flag."
Wallace additionally angered
some students when he made
another racially insensitive com-
ment during the speech.
"It never occurred to me back
in college that one day I would
be listening to Polish jokes, or
Jewish jokes, or Italian jokes, or
Black jokes, and laughing," Wal-
lace said.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Wallace's

youngest grandson, Lowell
Bourgeois, an LSA senior and
Wallace's fourth grandchild to
study at the University, said his
grandfather joked that his first
grandchild to go to the Univer-
sity would receive a car.
"Obviously none of us got a
car," Bourgeois said. "But his
purpose from a very early age
was to instill us with this idea of
Michigan and Michigan pride."
Bourgeois said Wallace's
home is abundantly decorated
with Michigan memorabilia. He
reflected back to 2006, when
Wallace addressed a crowd at
halftime during a Michigan foot-
ball game.
"He was always super aware
of what was going on at Michi-
gan," Wallace said.
Bourgeois said a shared con-
nection to the University allowed
for a very meaningful relation-
ship to his grandfather.
"It was a very nice way to be
able to connect with my grandfa-
ther," Bourgeois said.
Bourgeois added that his
grandfather may have been
inspired to donate to the Knight-
Wallace program because he
often argued that undergradu-
ates should major in subject
areas outside of journalism, in
order to study what they're pas-
sionate about and later translate
that passion through journalism.
He said the fellowship program
allows journalists to hone their
skills later in life.
Bourgeois said Wallace told
him he gained his love for radio
and journalism from working at
The Michigan Daily and the Uni-
versity's radio station.
"I think that his experience
with journalism and his role in
the media comes from exploring

his interests here on campus,"
Bourgeois said.
Though Wallace married four
times, Bourgeois said he loved all
of his grandchildren equally.
"There was never a shortage
of love he gave to us, and he has
a very constant presence in all of
our lives," Bourgeois said. "He
has seven grandchildren, and all
of us have extremely personal,
close connections with him."
Wallace's stepson, Angus
Yates, said in an interview with
the Daily that the University
held a special place in Wallace's
heart.
"He never forgot the place,
worked his whole life at improv-
ing Michigan and helping Michi-
gan," Yates said. "It was a very,
very important part of Mike's
life."
He added: "I think a lot of
what happened later in his
career came together or began at
Michigan. And that stayed with
him and became a very impor-
tant part of his persona and his
life, and he, I know, wanted to
make sure that other kids com-
ing through Michigan had the
same chances that he did, so he
and his wife Mary Wallace spent
a lot of time making sure that
Michigan offered opportunities
that were important to Mike."
Though Yates adored his step-
father, he acknowledged that
Wallace knew how to get under
the skin of his interviewees.
"He was a gifted genius, a very
sweet man but you could never
let your guard down," Yates said.
"He knew how to find your jug-
ular, and he knew how to ... he
knew how to get inside your soul.
But he was a lovely man, and a
real angel."
University President Mary

Sue Coleman said in a state-
ment that while Wallace may
be remembered nationwide as a
journalist, he meant much more
to the University than his profes-
sional record.
"Society will remember Mike
Wallace as a dedicated, hard-
charging journalist," Coleman
said. "At the University of Michi-
gan, we know him as that and so
much more. He was extremely
generous with his time, his
papers, his financial support,
and, most important, his belief
in this University and its role in
today's world. We could not have
asked for a more enthusiastic and
loyal alumnus, one whose words
and actions changed both the
University of Michigan and the
world beyond."
LSA freshman Justin Gold-
man - president of the Univer-
sity's chapter of Zeta Beta Tau,
the fraternity to which Wallace
held membership in during his
time at the University - said the
chapter is thankful for his legacy
as a brother of ZBT.
"We send our condolences to
Mr. Wallace's friends and fam-
ily," Goldman said. "It's ZBT
Michigan's 100-year anniversary
in September, we want to thank
him as a beneficial, benevolent
alumni and appreciate every-
thing he's done for ZBT in the
past."

stepdaughter, Pauline Dora,

FELLOWSHIP
From Page 1A
enduring contribution to the
University will be the key role
he played in helping develop the
Michigan Journalism Fellows
- the predecessor to the Knight-
Wallace Fellow programs.
"His defining legacy is a per-
manent, fully-endowed program
at the University of Michigan to
help: joirnalists in their career
to become even better than they
could otherwise through a year of
sabbatical study," Eisendrath said.
Though Wallace - a former
Michigan Daily reporter and
broadcaster at the University's
radio station - donated signifi-
cantly to the program, Eisendrath
said his support transcended mon-
etary donations, noting that Wal-
lace visited the fellows several
times a year to provide guidance
during their time at the University.

"When anybody was in New
York and wanted to talk jour-
nalism with him, or just simply
wanted to talk to him, he, without
exception, would open the office
and (tell them to) come on up,"
Eisendrath said.
Eisendrath said one regret Wal-
lace carried during his life was
becoming disconnected from the
University after his graduation
in 1939. He later used the Knight-
Wallace fellowship and other Uni-
versity partnerships to rejoin the
University community.
"Before the fellowships, he
hadn't had much to do with
Michigan, and he regretted that."
Eisendrath said. "He used these
programs as a way of getting back
in touch with the University, and
ended up co-chairing an endow-
ment drive which at the time was
the biggest in the history of public
universities in America ... at $1.3
billion."
Knight-Wallace fellow Evan

Halper, the Sacramento bureau
chief for The Los Angeles Times,
said Wallace is an inspiration for
the journalists who study in the
house he donated to campus. All
fellows have 24-hour access to
the building, which has an audio-
visual system, library, computer
lab with Wi-Fi, kitchen and dining
room.
"He was an amazingly inspi-
rational figure in terms of jour-
nalism," Halper said. "He was a
trendsetter, he sort of was some-
thing for the rest of all to aspire
toward."
Halper said Wallace's jour-
nalistic legacy is unsurpassed by
today's reporters.
"If you look at some of the sto-
ries he did in his lifetime, they're
just ... they're just phenomenal,"
Halper said. "It's intimidating to
look back at his body of work."
Halper added that Wallace's
spirit is still very much alive in the
Wallace house.

"The house and this program
embodies his values," Halper said.
"Several of us aspire to be the jour-
nalist he was, and we're grateful
for everything he did for the pro-
gram. He was a true friend and a
benefactor for this program."
Fellow Sarah Robbins, a BBC
America producer, said the house
not only allows reporters to gain
useful skills, but also provides
beneficial relationships with other
reporters.
"The fellowship is also about
building relationships with other
journalists and using the strength
and the time that we have to step
back from the daily grind of news-
rooms this year to rebuild and
refresh and try to go out and con-
tinue the important work of jour-
nalism in the future."
The program brings many for-
eign journalists to Ann Arbor as
well, including fellow Alencar
Izidoro from Brazil who said Wal-
lace helped form a one-of-a-kind

experience for him in Michigan.
"I don't know any other fel-
lowship likes this," Izidoro said.
"I have never heard of any other
fellowship that can spend a lot of
time just studying, just reflecting
about your career."
Izidoro's wife, Marcela Gui-
maraes, a radio journalist, said
Wallace stands as a model of
journalistic integrity to reporters
across the world, including Brazil.
"It's so important for us to be
here and enjoy this and remember ,
him," Guimaraes said. - k
Fellow Vanessa M. Gezari, a
reporter with The Washington
Post, said Wallace's presence is felt
by all who step foot in the house.
"Whenyou walk into the house,
there's a big photograph of Mike
Wallace and his wife on the wall
so we see him everyday when we
come in, and his spirit and sort of
the kind of journalism he repre-
sented is very much there," Gezari
said.

Gezari said the program offers a
chance for journalists from around
the world to take a break from their
daily jobs and hone their craft.
"It is one of the most amazing
opportunities available to Ameri-
can journalists, period," Gezari
said.
Gezari said Wallace's ability
to ask tough questions should be
a lasting model to future journal-
ists.
"He came from an era when I
think for American journalism
that-kind of approach was quite
new still," Gezari said. "I think
he really, in a way pioneered that
challenging approach, and I think
that we all are the inheritors of
that. I have to do that in my job,
and so does any journalist who
wantsto get more than just a press
release."

REPORT
From Page 1A
main objectives in their review
- to conduct an independent
investigation of the case's facts,
administer advice to the Uni-
versity on internal controls and
procedures and assist with any
corrective actions that may be
taken.
Last May, a medical resident
found Jenson's USB drive in a
computer in the University Hos-
pital's residents' lounge. After
finding the drive missing from
the computer the next day, she
reported her findings to 'her
supervisor, the attending physi-
cian, who notified the chair of
the Medical School Department
Compliance Officers.
After subsequently being
notified of the delay, on Dec. 3,
Coleman ordered the Office of
University Audits to conduct an
internal review regarding the
incident. Shortly after the results
of the audit were released, the
University's Board of Regents
ordered an external review of the
delay.
Jenson was arrested in Decem-
ber by University Police and was
arraigned on four counts of pos-
session of child pornography.
Later in February, prosecutors

dropped the state charges amid
federal charges against Jenson
for possessing and receiving 97
images and four videos of "sus-
pected child pornography."
Cunningham said Margolis
Healy & Associates was chosen
for the organization's expertise in
safety and security needs of high-
er education institutions. The
firm - whose managing partners,
Dr. Gary Margolis and Steven
Healy, are former campus police
chiefs - will assess the Univer-
sity's campus security operations,
includingthe Department of Pub-
lic Safety and Hospital Security,
who were directly involved in the
Jenson case delay.
"That will focus on helping
these units better understand
each other as they work together
to keep our university commu-
nity safe," Cunningham wrote in
another e-mail Saturday.
In the statement, Cunning-
ham also said Margolis Healy
& Associates will conduct a
"national benchmarking sur-
vey."
"We want to know how our
approach to campus security
- especially on a campus that
also has a major medical center
- lines up with peer universities
with medical centers," Cunning-
ham said.
Cunningham said she had not

seen a work plan for the review,
but believes Latham and Wat-
kins attorneys will re-inter-
view many of the people who
were questioned in the internal
review. She added that the Uni-
versity has compiled the neces-
sary reports and materials for
the firm to review.
According to Cunningham,
the review by Latham and
Watkins has a spending cap of
$395,000, but the review could
cost less. The initial proposal
by Margolis Healy & Associ-
ates priced their assessment at
$105,000, but Cunningham said
the amount is subject to change.
Ilitch and representatives
from Latham and Watkins did
not return calls for comment this
weekend.
Gary Margolis referred all
comment on his firm's involve-
ment in the review to the Uni-
versity's Office of Public Affairs.
"Typically, we don't comment
on the work we do for clients,"
Margolis said.
Cunningham acknowledged
that the University is still under
review by the U.S. Department of
Education for the delay, but said
there are no new developments
in the their review. Officials
from the department declined to
comment because the investiga-
tion is ongoing.

STEVEN SENNE/AP
Supporters in Milwaukee cheer for Romney as he speaks at a rally after winning the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday.
Romney faces challenges
in wooing female voters


Women focus
of political
campaigns, debates
WASHINGTON (AP) - Mitt
Romney is starting to hone his
appeal to female voters, acutely
aware as he turns to the general
election that he has little choice
but to narrow President Barack
Obama's commanding lead
among this critical constituency.
None too soon, say many
Republican activists. They
expect Romney, as well as his
popular wife, Ann, to make an

explicit pitch to female voters on
the economy and jobs, their top
issues.
The eventual nominee "needs
to start recognizing the power
that women voters have," said
Rae Lynne Chornenky, president
of the National Federation of
Republican Women.
Romney, on pace to clinch the
nomination in June, if not ear-
lier, acknowledges that the GOP
faces a historical challenge in
closing the advantage Democrats
have with women. Like Obama,
he sees pocketbook issues as the
key to winning them.
"We have work to do to make

sure we take our message to
the women of America, so they
understand how we're going to
get good jobs and we're going to
have a bright economic future
for them and for their kids,'
Romney said this past week in
Middleton, Wis.
By Friday, Obama was mak-
ing the same argument at the
White House, where he hosted
a conference on women and the
economy. He presented a full
review of the administration's
achievements on equal pay and
workplace flexibility as new
unemployment numbers showed
an uptick in job creation.

SPRINGFEST
From Page 1A
received freebies from organi-
zations such as the University's
Alumni Association, Sexual
Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center and Relay for Life.
Various booths also lined the
Diag, in a manner similiar to
Festifall, so students could learn
more about campus clubs.
Ibarra wrote in an e-mail
interview that the event is part
of a mission "to create a tradition
of hosting great charity concerts
and events that the Michigan
community can really enjoy."
"It is (a) great opportunity for
students to not only explore some

of the clubs on campus, but also
enjoy a day of fun, safe and infor-
mative activities," Ibarra wrote.
The highlight of SpringFest
was a drawing for J. Cole tick-
ets, Ibarra said. He added he has
been working closely with the
Center for Campus Involvement
to ensure the event would be
both safe and enjoyable.
Student participants said
SpringFest was a positive expe-
rience and a good opportunity
to gain exposure for their group.
LSA junior Alex Olkowski, a
SAPAC representative, said she
was pleased with the turnout.
"I always love these events
when student groups come
together," Olkowski said. "The
more opportunities to get vari-

ous groups' messages out, the
better."
LSA freshman Eric McInerney
has been involved with MUSIC
Matters since the beginning of
the school year and helped the
group raise more than $100,000.
McInerney worked closely with
Ibarra and a number of other stu-
dents to coordinate SpringFest,
adding that he hopes the orga-
nization hosts SpringFest every
year.
"(Next year) we would prob-
ably look to donate to a differ-
ent charity and bring a different
performer," he said. "Obviously
it's our first year, and it's tough
to get the word out at Michigan
because everyone's so busy. We
hope only to grow in the future."
ON


DISABILITIES
From Page 1A
"I think it's a good experience
to see how somebody might feel
(being disabled)," Rice said. "...
We are all only temporarily able.
You never know when a car wreck
is going to mess you or I up."
Engineering sophomore Nick
Finan, who emulated the symp-
toms of tetraplegia - the partial
or complete loss of use in limbs
and torso - during the meal, said
experiencing the limitations of a
disability was difficult, but it gave
him a new admiration for those
with incapacities.

"It's frustrating not having
control," Finan said. "It gives me
a lot of respect of how they live
their life and make it day to day."
Other fraternity members also
found the experience valuable,
gaining respect not only for the
difficulties people with disabili-
ties face, but also for the work of
caregivers for disabled people.
LSA sophomore Peter Sesek
said his experience at last year's
empathy dinner made him realize
how difficult it isto not have abili-
ties you're used to.
"I wasblind (as part of the din-
ner) last year," Sesek said. "That
feeling of being dependent on
someone is not something people
are used to."

LSA freshman Garrett Rizk
said the dinner helped him real-
ize how lucky he is.
"It's definitely an eye-opening
experience," Rizk said. "You can
think about having a disability,
but actually being put into the
experience, it really gave me a
higher appreciation for people
with disabilities."
In his closing remarks to his
fraternity brothers, Johnson
summed that Pi Kappa Phi annu-
allyhosts this eventin ordertocre-
ate equality and empathy between
thosewho are able and disabled.
"Sympathy is no good; no one
wants sympathy," Johnson said.
"Empathy is what allows us ... to
see each other as equals."

FINE ARTS COLUMN
Archer' on art
accessibility

FILM REVIEW
Stale'American Reunion'

may be the only person in the
world who takes life advice
from Sterling Archer.
If you aren't already watching
"Archer," FX's animated-comedy
jewel, you
should be.
Not because
the espionage
world's most
lovable ass-
hole should
even remotely
be considered
a role model, LAUREN
but because CASERTA
every once in
longwhile,
he offers a moment of clarity that
somehow counterbalances his
innumerable acts of stupidity.
In one such example of unin-
tentional insight, Archer and
a fellow escapee - who hap-
pens to be an anthropological
doctoral student - attempt to
evade an angry, AK-47-wielding
mob of Malaysian pirates, dur-
ing which time Archer finds
the time to tease him about his
limited anthropology-related job
prospects. Whenthe doctoral
candidate insists that he plans to
teach, Archer points out that he'll
still only be instructing future
anthropology majors, "thus con-
tinuing the circle of'why bother?'
As crude as his interpretation
may be, Archer taps into the pri-
mal fears of any and all who love
the arts, liberal or otherwise, and
preys on one of the art world's
greatest problems: accessibility.
How do we keep a knowledge
and enjoyment of the arts from
becoming trapped in a perpetual
loop of aficionados in a closed
community? How can we grab
the interest of those who would
not otherwise go searching for
the arts on their own? How can
we keep from becoming obsolete?
Part of this fear stems not
from a decline in the quality of
fine arts, but rather a rapidly
ballooning access to other types
of media that enjoy the benefits
of the Internet. You can view
seven-time Oscar nominee
"The Shawshank Redemption,"
IMDB's top user-voted movie,
without leaving your room. You
can download, watch and post a
review to your blog about "Game
of Thrones" without even putting
onyour pants.
But the fine arts often don't get
the chance to enjoy this explosion
of access to otherwise restricted
or alienated content. You can't
enjoy most fine arts from the
comfort of your room - expe-
riencing them means not only
putting on pants, but putting on
nice pants.
I'll be the first to admit I've
skipped more than one on-
campus performance to enjoy the
comforts of my room, but I've also
dragged myself out the door to a
performance, only to be amazed
that I might have missed it to
stay home or wander to a friend's
apartment party. The countless
people in and around the Univer-
sity that make it possible to rope

in artists from around the world
or coordinate the acquisition of
priceless works of art are making
the effort to bringthe fine arts to
us - and sometimes, we have to
meet them halfway.
Accessibility is somethingthat
the University has down pat, but
it continues to come up with new
ways of ensuringthateach of us
takes advantage of the time we
have in the midst of one of the
richest fine-arts hubs in the Unit-
ed States. UMS' monthly "Arts
& Eats" draws out the starving
college student in all of us while
giving us a window into song,
dance and theater from around
the world. And the number of
free performances offered to us,
from student and professional
groups alike, really is a steal - all
we have to do is look them up,
then show up.
The fine arts are
worth putting
on your pants.
We need to take advantage of
the accessibility we are fortunate
enough to havejust a few steps
outside our doors, not only to
enrich ourselves, but to learn how
we can bringthe arts to those
who aren't given the resources
we get to enjoy. Because once we
graduate and find ourselves back
in the real world, we won't be so
lucky. Unless we planto teach or
live next to a university with such
a strong emphasis on the liberal
arts, we may never again listen to
an international orchestra, watch
a country-hopping theater troupe
or come within inches of some of
the world's most famous works of
art. Schools everywhere are cut-
ting funding for the fine arts, and
I have a yearly miniature heart
attack every time public funding
for PBS comes under the budget-
ary microscope. What would my
childhood have been like without
"Great Performances at the Met"
or "Masterpiece Theater" - and
would I have ever thought to
apply to be a fine-arts columnist
without them?
With the year winding down
and the moving-out e-mails
pouring in, it seems as though
I have little time to enjoy a few
last-minute fine-arts perfor-
mances or gallery strolls. But
my view of the ominous cloud
hovering in the distance that is
my senior year has inspired me
to make a promise to myself.
I promise that I will make the
most of my last year amid the
arts at the 'U.' And I promise
that even after I have finished
this column, my last as our fine-
arts columnist, Itwill continue
to encourage new ideas that help
make the arts accessible to all.

zone. To join her and Archer,

he's the one facilitating much of
the alcohol-induced mayhem.
All of the partying is lazily
strung together with desperate
ploys by the directors (Jon Hur-
witz and Hayden Schlossberg,

ings of nostalgia, and it's just
too goddamn phony to count
for anything. And to a certain
degree, there's no point blam-
ing the directors - by the time
one rolls on down to the fourth
film in a franchise, the mate-
rial is beaten to the point where
it would take nothing short of
a miracle to make a line sound

original.
In response, the writers and
directors are left with small bits
of material that do nothing more
than pay homage to the previ-
ous films. It's a cop-out, but one
that makes money. And there's
no point doubting "American
Reunion" will bring in ticket
sales - even if those tickets are
only bought by the graduating
senior class of 1999, who can
remember first-hand the joy of
watching Jim stripping down in

As for everyone else, let us
pray to the heavenly being that
is Stifler's Mom that they don't
make another one.

FILM REVIEW
Unsubtie 'Salmon' doesn't bite

By PHILIP CONKLIN
Daily Arts Writer
In the middle of the first scene
of"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"
somewhere amid the lyrical cam-

era moves,
light orchestral
score and sym-
metrical faces,
it starts to feel
pretty obvious
what the rest of
the movie has in
store. Though it
has some funny
and origi-

of gravitational force that drags
the movie relentlessly down into
broad sentimentality. Despite
a promising premise, "Salmon
Fishing" seems determined to
be just another sappy romantic
dramedy.
The story, basically, is that
a Yemeni sheikh (Amr Waked,
"Syriana") wants to bring salm-
on from Britain to his country's
deserts. But behind this are lots
of characters and moving parts.
There's Patricia Maxwell (Kris-
tin Scott Thomas, "Sarah's Key")
the prime minister's press secre-
tary, who's determined to chase
a good story out of the Middle
East among all the bad press.
There's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot
(Emily Blunt, "The Adjustment
Bureau"), the sheikh's sensitive
but strong financial consultant.
There's Dr. Alfred "Fred" Jones

(Ewan McGregor, "Beginners")
a by-the-book fisheries expert
who's brought in to head up the
project. And, of course, there's the
sheikh, a philosophizing mystic
who speaks almost exclusively in
pearls of wisdom. It's a lot to keep
track of, but the movie's brisk,
sure pacing keeps up a nice energy
through the lengthy exposition.

The Wolverines (8-1 Big Ten,

Michigan fell behind 2-Din the

before scoring 10 unanswered
runs, highlighted by two home
runs from freshman designated

RBIs by junior second baseman

Nine of the 10 runs scored by

The Wolverines' energy was

Szkutnik was credited with
Saturday's win, putting him at

Szkutnik and Lakatos both
made appearances in unex-

the offensive side when the
game went into extra innings
and the benches thinned.
"I used every guy we had in

Szkutnik hit in high school

The 2012 Schefters: Chronicling Michigan's resurrection

7u've probably heard
plenty about resurrection
lately.
As Easter Sunday passes
and thoughts turn back to the
semester's
final week of
classes, take
a moment to
reminisce and
dream along
as we delve
back into the
year that was -
through the STEPHEN J.
lens of Michi- NESBITT
gan athletics.
It was cer-
tainly a year of resurrection - of
Michigan football, of Michigan
basketball and of the Michigan
brand. With that in mind, we
offer you Daily Sports' second-
annual awards - The Schefters.
Named after ESPN personal-
ity Adam Schefter, one of the
Daily's most esteemed alumni,
the awards honor the best of
Michigan athletics in the last
year. Schefter worked as a Daily
Sports Editor in the late 1980s
and currently serves as ESPN's
NFL insider.
The single rule is simple: An
athlete can win only one cat-
egory. Beyond that, it's no holds
barred.
Without further fanfare, here
are the 2012 Schefters:
Best Cinderella Story: Shawn
Hunwick, ice hockey
Michigan's fifth-year senior
goaltender never really lost the
title, even after winning it in last
year's edition of the Schefters.
Exactly a year ago - April
9,2011 - the 5-foot-7 Hunwick
took the Wolverines into over-
time of the NCAA Championship
Game before surrendering the
game-winner to Minnesota-
Duluth's Kyle Schmidt. It was his
24th birthday.
Then, in his fifth-year senior-
season, Hunwick carried a young
Michigan team to a No. 2-over-
all seed and into the program's
22nd-consecutive NCAA Tour-
nament, where they lost in the
first round.
Instead of his unlikely career
ending there, Hunwick received
a surprise call from the Colum-

bus Blue Jackets on the morning
of March 28. Hunwick was going
to the NHL. Wearing a No. 31
Blue Jackets sweater over his
Michigan equipment, Hunwick
sat on the end of the bench in
Columbus' 4-2 victory over the
Detroit Red Wings - the team
he idolized growing up.
On Friday, Hunwick played
the final 153 seconds of the Blue
Jackets' last game of the season.
The shrimp who came to Michi-
gan asa third-string practice
goaltender had made the NHL.
Today is his 25th birthday.
And his Cinderella story lives on.
Breakout Athlete of the Year:
Fitzgerald Toussaint, football
Entering fall camp, the Michi-
gan football team was looking at
a handful of candidates for the
starting tailback spot. The argu-
ment seemed a moot point - the
Michigan running game would
undeniably be run through
junior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson.
So we thought.
Toussaint took the starting
role early in the season and bolt-
ed for 1,041 yards last season as a
redshirt sophomore. His average
yards per rush (5.57) was better
than Robinson's (5.32), and the
pair became the first Michigan
tandem to break the 1,000-yard
plateau since Rob Lytle and Gor-
don Bell in 1975.
Best single-game perfor-
mance: Junior Hemingway, foot-
ball, in the AllState Sugar Bowl
Rarely will two receptions
for 63 yards earn you a place in
Michigan lore. For Hemingway,
a fifth-year senior wide receiver,
those two receptions couldn't
have come at a more opportune
time.
They came at the Mercedes-
Benz Superdome in New
Orleans. Hemingway scored
both of Michigan's touchdowns
in a 23-20 victory over Virginia
Tech.
And if his miraculous play on
the field didn't seal the deal, his
postgame speech atop the win-
ner's podium did.
"It shows our heart. It shows
our determination. It shows
everything we've been through,
because we've been through a

lot," Hemingway said through a
stream of tears, cheers and con-
fetti. "People don't understand
that, but to come out here and
win this bowl game with the
people I've worked so hard with
from day one feels so good. Ain't
nothing like it."
Game of the Year: Under the
Lights: Michigan vs. Notre Dame
This category can't be argued.
What better to signal the res-
urrection of Michigan football
than the program's first night
game at Michigan Stadium? And
it was a classic.
Yellow pom-poms flashed
through the record crowd of
114,804 in the Big House.
Just a few ticks before mid-
night, Robinson completed
Michigan's furious comeback
by floating a pass against the
night sky to wide receiver Roy
Roundtree in the corner of the
endzone.
The end result was a 35-31
Michigan victory. The end result
was the unquestioned Game of
the Year.
Team of the Year: Michigan
men's basketball
With the sting of a first-round
loss to Ohio in the NCAA Tour-
nament still present, this might
seem like a foolish pick. Trust
me, it's not.
Under Michigan coach John
Beilein, the team that lost star
point guard Darius Morris to the
NBA a year ago bounced back
to win a share of the Big Ten
regular-season title.
It sounds impressive. It's more
than that.
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke - an unheralded recruit
- propelled the overachieving
Wolverines to their first confer-
ence championship since 1986.
It ended badly, and Burke may
be headed for the NBA, but what
that program displayed this past
year was something none of us
expected.
Coach of the Year: Brady
Hoke, football
Hoke arrived last Januaryto
replace former Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez, who went 15-22
in three seasons in Ann Arbor.
Twelve months later, Hoke
had carried a team loaded with

eDA M G'A
Senior wrestler Kellen Russell is a four-time Big Ten champion a nd two-time national champion at 141 pounds.

Rodriguez's players to a victory
in a BCS bowl and an 11-2 season.
Hoke was named the winner of
the first Hayes-Schembechler
Trophy, given to the Big Ten
Coach of the Year.
He brought countless adjust-
ments to the Michigan football
culture, including (1) a rule ban-
ning the color red from Schem-
bechler Hall, (2) referring to
Ohio State as simply "Ohio," (3)
referring to his team, Michigan's
132nd in history, as "Team 132"
and (4) bringing player numbers
back to the winged helmet.
Most of all, he brought win-
ning back to Michigan. Forget
everything else. That's enough.
Female Athlete of the Year:
Emina Bektas
Bektas has taken the women's
tennis scene by storm.
The freshman sensation is
ranked No. 10 and fills Michi-
gan's top singles spot. Boasting
a 25-6 overall record, as well as
a sterling 14-2 doubles record,
Bektas is a four-time Big Ten
Athlete of the Week honoree.
The Indianapolis native will
lead Michigan into the Big Ten
and NCAA Tournaments in the
next month.

Male Athlete of the Year: Trey
Burke, men's basketball
There were several deserving
student-athletes in this category.
It could have been filled by
Hunwick or by wrestler Kellen
Russell, but you'll have to look
elsewhere for their names. It
could have been swimmer Dan
Madwed or football center David
Molk.
But Burke takes the cake.
As a freshman, Burke aver-
aged 14.8 points and 4.6 assists
per game. Considered a step
down from Morris as the season
opened, Burke proved every
doubter wrong. While the host
of starters struggled down the
stretch and into the postsea-
son, Burke was a complete floor
general. He didn't just live up to
Morris's billing, he surpassed it.
In the Big Ten Tournament
opener against Minnesota, he
dropped 30 points to give Michi-
gan the overtime victory.
Whether or not he returns for
a sophomore season, Burke gave
Michigan one heck of a season to
remember.
Career Achievement Award:
Kellen Russell, wrestling
There's not a lot left to say

about Russell, who won consecu-
tive national championships at
the 141-pound level. You could
give him nearly every one of
these awards.
He was Michigan's only
individual national champion
in 2011-12. In a year that was
defined by resurrection, Russell
didn't have to change a thing.
He finished his career at
Michigan with a 134-12 record.
Only one grappler beat him in
his junior and senior seasons.
The three-time All-American
also became the first Wolverine
wrestler to capture four consec-
utive Big Ten championships.
On Saturday, it was
announced that Russell was
given one of the final two free-
style wildcard selections for the
U.S. Olympic Team Trials in
Iowa City at the end of April.
Russell has left his mark on
Michigan, but his legacy will
extend long past the confines
of the Bahna Wrestling Center.
Because he'll leave the only way
he knows how - as a champion.

Wolverines' road ends at NCAA Regionals in Auburn

6

By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer
There will be no Cinderella
story for the Michigan women's
gymnastics team in 2012. The
senior-less team, which has been
riddled by injuries all season, had
an opportunity to prove their
doubters wrong during this week-
end's NCAA Regional Competion,
but the glass slipper just didn't fit
right.
The 21st-ranked Wolverines
promised all season that they
would put together their best per-
formance at the NCAA Tourna-
ment, and they didn't disappoint.
After tallying a season-high
196.325, Michigan (16-10) watched
its season come to an unexpected
end on Saturday at the hands of
Oregon State. The Beavers' Les-
lie Mak, who leads the nation on
beam, hit a 9.925 routine to edge
out the Wolverines by .125 points
in a battle for second place. Geor-
gia, who defeated Michigan on
March 9, finished first in the
Auburn regionals and will join

Oregon State in the NCAA Cham-
pionships.
"I am proud of them for a lot of
reasons,"said Michigan coach Bev
Plocki. "We fought through a very
difficult season. A lot of people
came up to me after the meet and
told me how incredibly impressed
they were with how we performed
and how we finished the season.
Everyone knew what we were
going through. That's nice and
great to hear, but losingby.125 is a
little hard to swallow."
Despite falling short of
their 20th NCAA Champion-
ships berth, the Wolverines will
send junior Katie Zurales and
sophomore Joanna Sampson as
representatives at the NCAA
Individual Event Finals. Zurales'
39.375 as an all-arounder earns
her the top score of the non-qual-
ifying team's, while Sampson tied
for the regional title on vault with
a 9.925.
"I'm not going to lie, I am really
sad that my team isn't going to
be there with me, but I am really
excited that Michigan will be rep-

resented at nationals," Zurales
said. "I can't wait to go out there
and represent them well. I want to
bring home something for Michi-
gan, because we deserve it with
everything we've been through.
I'm going to put it all out there and
do it for the block 'M."'
The night looked promising for
Michigan, as it opened the meet
with a 49.300 on vault.
Zurales and Sampson led the
way competing from the heart of
the lineup with a pair of 9.925s to
tie Zurales' career-high. Sopho-
more Reema Zakharia debuted a
new routine that earned a 9.850,
followed by freshmen Sachi Sugi-
yama's 9.825. The event's first two
competitors, sophomore Stepha-
nie Colbert and freshman Annette
Miele, also contributed with
scores of 9.750 and 9.775, respec-
tively.
The momentum continued on
uneven bars, where the Wolver-
ines totaled a 49.050. An impres-
sive 9.850 from sophomore Shelby
Gies headlined the event for Mich-
igan, along with Zurales' 9.775 to

start the rotation. A disappointing
9.550 from Miele amplified the
pressure for the rest of Michigan's
lineup. After a pair of 9.800s from
Sugiyama and Sampson, the Wol-
verines turned to junior Brittnee
Martinez for support.
Martinez, who returned to
action for the first time since
injuring her ankle on March 2 at
Penn State, delivered a 9.825 and
preserved Michigan's score. The
Wolverines' 98.350 score at the
halfway point of the meet was just
half a point behind Georgia, which
held the lead throughout.
In its third rotation, a few wob-
bles on balance beam resulted in
a 48.750 for Michigan. Zurales'
team-high 9.850 tied for third
place, followed by a leadoff score
of 9.800 from Gies. Contributions
from Sampson's 9.750 and Miele's
9.700 placed the Wolverines in a
good position, but a slipped dis-
mount from Sugiyama earned a
9.650. Colbert rounded out the
lineup with a 9.500, but it was not
counted in Michigan's final score
for the event..

Georgia finished off its evening
during the Wolverines' bye round,
which put the battle for second
between Michigan and Oregon
State. The Beavers' 49.300 on bars
put them ahead of the Wolverines
heading into the final rotation by a
mere four-tenths of a point.
Another late rally seemed to
be in the makings as Michigan
prepared itself for the floor exer-
cise. A career-high 9.875 from
Sugiyama earned fourth place
for the event, while Sampson and
Zakharia added a pair of 9.850s.
Another set of identical scores,
this time from Zurales' and Col-
bert's 9.825, deepened the Wol-
verines' push. Despite a total of
49.225 on the event, Michigan's
score just wasn't enough to top
Oregon State's impressive perfor-
mance on beam.
"I thought we started and fin-
ished the meet like we were the
champs," Plocki said. "On beam,
we made some silly errors, and
we're sitting at home by .125
because of it. It breaks my heart
for this team because I felt that

with the season we had, I was
hoping it would be the Cinderella
story ending."
For only the second time in the
past 21 seasons, the Wolverines'
have missed out on the chance to
qualify for the NCAA Champion-
ships. Additionally, Michigan has
finished below third only one time
in the program's history, when it
placed fourth in 1993. The Wolver-
ines will add to the record books
this season, though, as Sampson
and Zurales' performance gives
Michigan 54 NCAA Regional
event titles in its history.
While they will have to wait
until next year to compete for a
national championship, the Wol-
verines are loaded with potential.
Michigan will return its entire
squad, including junior Natalie
Beilstein, who missed the major-
ity of the season with an injured
Achilles tendon. In addition to a
slate of impressive recruits, Mich-
igan's lineup could be one of the
best in the nation after Miele and
Sugiyama train for an entire off-
season.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Sophomore Sam Mikulak placed first on the high bar at the Big Ten Championships over the weekend.

Ervin, James, Myler and Strath-
ern all advanced to the individu-
al-event finals on Saturday.
In that event, Mikulak placed
first in parallel bars and high
bars, making him the first Wol-
verine to win two conference
titles since 2000. He also tied for
third in the floor round.
"(Mikulak) wasn't on top of
his game this weekend and didn't
repeat as all-around champion,"
Golder said. "However, when

you can be off and still win two
Big Ten titles, it says a lot for his
ability. He was a finalist in four
events after a rough weekend,
and I'm sure he will be on top of
his game when it comes to the
NCAA Championships."
Ervin placed in the event
finals for all three of the events
he participated in on Friday. As
he was all season, he continued
to be a spark for the team, plac-
ing third with a 15.25 on his vault

fell, 10-8, after four extra
frames.
"I don't think we were as
sharp (Sunday)," Maloney said.
But the Wolverines played on
and nearly swept the series. The
pitchers all made positive con-
tributions, especially some of
the newer players on the team.
The high run count on Sun-
day was inflated by five errors,
which Maloney attributed to a
combination of sunny skies and
high winds.
"They're a young team, and
I'm liking the growth that I'm
seeing," Maloney said.
SINNERY SHINES: A stand-
ing ovation and roaring cheers
marked the end of Sinnery's per-
formance in Friday's baseball
game against Michigan State.
Recording all but two outs, he
allowed no runs and picked up
the win for Michigan.
Sinnery has won two games

for Michigan this season and
lost three.
Last Friday's game against
Minnesota was one of those
losses, and it did not end with
applause for Sinnery.
In six innings of work, Sin-
nery allowed a total ofsix earned
runs and nine hits.
Sinnery was later replaced by
junior right-hander Kyle Clark,
a hurler who didn't allow a
run in his two innings of relief
pitching.
Michigan coach Rich Malo-
ney was discouraged with Sin-
nery's performance last week,
so the fact that he let Sinnery
start off the Michigan State
series on the mound proves his
confidence in Sinnery's skill.
Sinnery has pitched 52.1
innings, 10 more than junior
right-hander Ben Ballantine,
who follows in highest number
of innings pitched.
But Sinnery's earned-run
average, 4.30, is one of the worst
on the team - much higher
than those of Michigan's other

Delaney also looked good in
Saturday's game, knocking in
two runs for the day on two hits.
"I tried to step up a little bit
more this weekend since (sopho-
more outfielder Michael O'Neill)
was out," Delaney said.
Delaney has steadily
improved throughout the sea-
son.
Despite his 0.198 average, his
name is beginning to creep up
the charts, toward the big hit-
ters in the lineup like freshman
outfielder Will Drake, junior
outfielder Patrick Biondi and
O'Neill.
"I struggled a little bit at the
beginning, but I've been work-
ing really hard and I feel like I'm
a lot more confident," Delaney
said.
"Hopefully we'll get a couple
more mid-week games this week
and then take the end of the
series."

SOFTBALL
From Page 1B
baseman Amanda Chidester hit a
bases-clearing double to give the
Wolverines a 5-2 lead. The fol-
lowing batter, Lane, then singled
Chidester in to put Michigan up,
6-2.
Sophomore left fielder Nicole
Sappingfield's first of four hits on
the game enabled her to score the
tie-breaking and ultimate game-
winning run.
"It takes all of us to win,"
Hutchins said. "We're not a super-
star team."
The Wolverines' patience at the
plate led seven different players to
collect at least one hit.
"You really need to wait for
your pitch rather than swinging at
the pitcher's pitch," Sappingfield
said. "You can definitely tell when
we we're beingpatient."
In Saturday's second game
- the final game of the series -
Michigan continued what they
had done all weekend: force the
Buckeyes (5-4, 23-14) to throw a
lot of pitches.
The Wolverines jumped out to
an early lead by scoring four runs
in the first inning. Driesenga drew
the fourth walk of the inning to
put the Wolverines up 1-0 without
registering a hit.
The first hit finally came when
junior shortstop Amy Knapp laced
abases-clearing double to the wall
to make the score 4-0. By the end
of the first, Endicott had thrown
60 pitches. She finished the game
with 144.
Michigan's lead would not last
long, though. Ohio State got its
first three batters on base before
sophomore first baseman Evelyn
Carrillo connected a grand slam to
right field to tie the game up, 4-4.
The Wolverines quickly struck
back, scoring a run in the second
and third innings to make the
score 6-4.
"It really showed with our
team that when we get down, no
one stresses because we're used
to coming back every day," said
senior third baseman Stephanie
Kirkpatrick.
After Michigan gave a run back
due to two errors in the fifth, Ohio
State seemed to gain momentum
going into the sixth. But with two
runners on and two outs, sopho-
more left fielder Nicole Sapping-
field made a diving catch to record
the final out of the inning and keep
the lead intact.
Wagner then finished the job by
retiring the Buckeyes 1-2-3 to earn
her 19th win of the season - on
her 19th birthday, no less.
Facing a tie or deficit at the
beginning of the game turned out
to be a common theme throughout
the weekend for the Wolverines.
"We play one inning at a time,"
Hutchins said. "We keep moving
forward."
With the sweep of the Buck-
eyes, Michigan now stands alone
atop of the Big Ten standings after
coming into the weekend tied for
second with Ohio State.
"We just needed to come back
and come back strong," Kirkpat-
rick said. "Sweeping a team with a
similar record is only going to help
us in the long run."


DELAWARE
From Page 1B
The Blue Hens struck twice
in the first quarter before Yealy
capitalized on a man-up oppor-
tunity after a Delaware penalty.
The first quarter ended with
Michigan trailing 3-1. The sec-
ond quarter saw Delaware net
three goals, but they were coun-
tered by freshman attackman
David McCormack's two goals
and another from Yealy.
Coming out of halftime down
6-4, the Wolverines allowed two
more Blue Hen goals before Yealy
tallied another goal to make the
score 8-5 at the end of the third

quarter. Freshman defenseman
Jack Eisenreich and fifth-year
senior faceoff man Brian Greiner
both found theback of the net late
in the fourth quarter, but only
after the Wolverines allowed
three more Blue Hen goals.
Michigan's lack of experience
playing at the Division I level
has been a plague, which again
showed with its shortcomings
against Delaware.
"We have a lot of freshmen
playing on the field right now,"
Paul said. "They are being asked
to play at a very high level pretty
early in their careers. No ques-
tion, that (inexperience) is part
of today's loss."
With the high amount of pres-

sure put on his defense, Paul will
look for his defensemen to take
advantage of more opportunities
to clear the ball from the Michi-
gan zone in the future.
"The defense played a great
game, other than they needed to
do a better job on ground balls,"
Paul said. "We needed to clear
the ball better, and that is on the
defense."
Despite seeing more pressure
than he's accustomed to, fresh-
man goalie Emil Weiss had a
career-high 17 saves and gained
his coaches' praises for stopping
34 of the 45 shots Delaware tried
to put past him.
"Emil played very well in cage
today," Paul said. "He did a great

job with stopping the ball. Emil
was huge for us today in keeping
the game close."
The loss was another tough
one for Michigan, which hasn't
experienced very much success
this season, but the team isn't
focused on what's behind them.
Instead, it's focused on next Sat-
urday's game against Ohio State.
The Buckeyes (5-6) will be play-
ing lacrosse for the first time in
Michigan Stadium, and the Wol-

verines are looking to give them a
warm welcome.
The event will be held after
the Michigan football team's
spring game.
"We are really excited," Paul
said. "The setting is going to be
incredible. It is something we
have been talking about all year.
I hope this will be a great oppor-
tunity for us to showcase this
program as we build a new tradi-
tion."

Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - With Michi-
gan leading 6-2 in the fourth
inning of Friday's game against
Ohio State, junior second base-
man Ashley Lane saw 11 pitches
before she took a power swing.
And after putting six balls in
foul territory, Lane's 12th pitch
of the at-bat soared over the left-
field fence.
Lane's three-run home run
extended the No. 20 Michigan
softball team's lead to seven, but
her long at-bat was even more
pleasing her coach.
"That was actually a fantas-
tic at-bat," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins. "(Lane) hung
in there. She only got a piece of
that ball, but she's got a lot of
power."
Patience was a virtue for the
Wolverines this weekend.
They took their time at the
plate throughout the weekend
sweep of Ohio State, forcing the
Buckeye pitchers to throw seven
or eight pitches per batter and
quickly rack up pitches. After
three innings on Friday, Ohio
State's Mikayla Endicott had
thrown 103 pitches to Michi-
gan batters, and during Satur-
day's second game, she threw 60
pitches in the first inning alone.
"(Endicott) was throwing a
lot of pitches, which bodes well
for us," Hutchins said after Fri-
day's 10-2 win. "I like that we
made her throw a lot. We did our
best when we had our patient
