From D.C. to Ann
Arbor, University
students watch
historic ceremony
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily Staff Reporter
With the world watching, Barack
Obama was sworn in yesterday as the
44th president of the United States on
the west steps of the Capitol Building.
Obama's inauguration, the 56th
in American history, drew millions
of supporters to Washington, D.C.,
and millions more to television sets
around the world. In his inaugural
speech, Obama reassured the coun-
$ try and the world that the problems
facing America would be addressed
methodically and with immediacy.
"Today I say to you that the chal-
lenges we face are real. They are seri-
ous and they are many. They will not
k be met easily or in a short span of
time. But know this, America - they
will be met," he said just after taking
theoath of office.
Obama then called on Americans to
assume a greater role in government
to help rebuild the country.
"Starting today, we must pick our-
selves up, dust ourselves off, and begin
again the work ofremakingAmerica,"
Obama said.
LSA senior Jason Emmendorfer
was in D.C. for the inauguration yes-
terday.
"It was such a big deal," he said.
"History was being made, which is
why we made this trip - to be a part
of history."
School of Music, Theatre, & Dance
senior Liam White, who also attended
the inauguration, said he was there
to celebrate the start of the Obama
administration and the end of the
Bush administration.
"We were delebratingthe change of
regime," he said. "We were so happy
that Bush was over."

MICHIGAN STUDENT ASSEMBLY
After long debate, MSA
passes Gaza resolution

REBULDING A FOOTBALL TEAM
Robinson chosen to

ByJENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
For the second week in a row,
issues surrounding the situation
in Gaza dominated a majority of
the Michigan Student Assembly's
weekly meeting in the Michigan
Union.
Amended versions of ttwo reso-
lutions discussed at last week's
meeting concerning the conflict
were brought up for a vote at last
night's meeting. The debate and
subsequent consideration of the
proposals attracted numerous
speakers from the community,
including several students and
a multitude of opinions on the
topic.

The first resolution brought
before the assembly, "Calling for
a Ceasefire in Gaza," authored
by Rackham Rep. Kate Stenvig,
called for a letter to be sent to
The Michigan Daily and The Ann
Arbor News demonstrating MSA's
support for a permanent ceasefire
in Gaza.
Stenvig adamantly defended
the resolution, though it eventu-
ally failed to pass.
"I think that we need to be
taking a stand and saying that
we support a ceasefire and the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from
Gaza, including allowing the pas-
sage of humanitarian aid to the

SLIDING TO AN "A"

The drugstore desert

As the state hunkers down
for another long Michigan win-
ter, the need for medicines to
treat everything from a runny
nose to the flu is high. So where
can students and faculty have
their prescriptions filled?
There's always the Village
Apothecary on South University
Avenue, but the list pretty much
ends there.
Maggie Ladd, the South
University business director
said the South University cor-
ridor is the only location close
to campus to have a drug store.
She said it's because there sim-
ply isn't a retail space large
enough for a major drugstore
chain.
Bill Milliken, President of
Michigan's Commercial Board
of Realtors, said commercial
drugstores like CVS Pharma-

ty or Walgreen's would need
a 14,000-square-foot space.
Also, the store would have to
be in an area that could support
high traffic because large drug-
stores generally receive 20,000
to 25,000 customers a day, Mil-
liken said.
Despite these concerns, a
CVS Pharmacy almost came
to the campus area when the
Steve and Barry's apparel store
filed for bankruptcy. Steve and
Barry's was forced to vacate its
large State Street location and
CVS Pharmacy expressed inter-
est in moving into the space.
But the owner of the build-
ing opted for another clothing
store, M-Den, instead.
Tom Heywood, State Street
business director, said there
used to be a drug store at the
corner of Washington Street

and State Street, but the owner
decided to close it down toX
build a new building.
Heywood added there is a .
definite need for a major-drug-
store close to campus, because
it is inconvenient for students
to drive to buy the everyday
necessities that a drugstore .
offers.
Though there still isn't a
drugstore on State Street, stu-
dents can get their prescrip-
tions filled at the University
pharmacy - a part of Univer-
sity Health Services.
Gwen Chivers, the ancil-
lary director of the University
pharmacy, said the pharmacy
offers many different servic-
es and tries to negotiate low
prices that can be passed on to
students. Architecture seniors Dana Ar

BRENNAN LINSLEY/AP
Joe Holland, who lost his son Joseph Holland in the Sept. 11, 2001 attack in New York speaks during a press conference following a
hearing at the U. S. Military Commissions court for war crimes, at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Monday.
Defense accuses prosecution
of stalling in Gitmo trial

Prosecutors ask to
put trial on hold
GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL
BASE, Cuba (AP) - Guantanamo
prosecutors want to put the war
crimes trials on hold while the
future of the widely criticized tri-
bunals remains in doubt, military
defense lawyers said Tuesday.
Prosecutors want an indefinite
continuance of all pending cases
while President Barack Obama's
administration reviews the military
commissions system and the legal
alternatives for prosecuting suspect-
ed terrorists, said Navy Lt. Cmdr.
William Kuebler, a military defense
lawyer who represents a Canadian
being triedbefore the tribunals.
Air Force Col. Peter Masciola,
the chief defense counsel for the
Guantanamo military commissions,
said the chief prosecutor, Army Col.
Lawrence Morris, called himto dis-
cuss the proposal. Defense lawyers
oppose an indefinite stay and would
challenge the motion if filed, fear-
ing it is a bid to buy time to preserve
the system.
Defense lawyers want to scrap the
Guantanamo military commissions
and have pending charges formally
withdrawn withoutprejudice, which
would allow authorities to refile

them later in a traditional U.S. mili-
tary court martial, a civilian court or
a combination, Masciola said.
The military has charges pend-
ing against 21 men and officials
had said they intended to charge
dozens more.
"The prosecution would rather
see a delay because they want to
keep the cases in the commissions
process," Masciola said. "They don't,
like us, think the commissions pro-
cess is fundamentally flawed."
Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon,
a Pentagon spokesman, declined
to confirm the defense attorney
accounts, saying: "We do notdiscuss
internal consultations among the
trial parties."
A spokesman for the military
commissions said the chief prosecu-
tor was not immediately available to
comment.
Both sides are scheduled to
reconvene Wednesday for more
pretrial hearings in two cases -
the trial of five men charged in the
Sept. 11 attacks and Omar Khadr, a
Canadian accused of killing a U.S.
soldier in Afghanistan - and "will
continue until directed otherwise,"
Gordon said.
Kuebler, who represents Khadr,
said the military judges are likely to
rejectan indefinite stay. Some defen-
dants might also oppose the idea,

including the Sept. 11 suspects, who
have said they want to plead guilty
to charges that carry a potentia
death sentence.
The proposed indefinite delay;
Kuebler said, seems like an effort to
buytime in hopes offindingawaytc
preservethe system:
"It appears to be an ongoing last
ditch effort to save this disgusting
mess," he said.
The behind-the-scenes maneu,
vering came on the day a military
judge adjourned the war crimes
court just before Obama was sworn
in by noting the future of the com-
missions is in doubt. The hearings
were dismissed until Wednesday
"unless otherwise ordered."
Obama has said he will close
Guantanamo and many expect he
will suspend the widely criticized
,war-crimes trials created by former
President George W. Bush and Con-
gress in 2006.
Obama's nominee for attorney
general has said the so-called mili-
tary commissions lack sufficient
legal protections for defendants
and that they could be tried in the
United States.
Despite the doubts about its
future, military judges decided to
press on with this week's session,
perhaps the last to be held at the U.S.
base in Cuba.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Kennedy taken to
hospital during
Obama luncheon
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, ill
with a brain tumor, was hospital-
ized Tuesday but quickly reported
feelingwell after suffering a seizure
at a post-inauguration luncheon for
President Barack Obama.
"After testing, we believe the
incident was brought on by simple
fatigue," Dr. Edward Aulisi, chair-
man of neurosurgery at Wash-
ington Hospital Center said in a
statement released by the senator's
office.
"He will remain ... overnight for
observation, and will be released in
the morning."
The statement said the 76-year-
old senator "is awake, talking with
family and friends, and feeling
well."
The statement did not disclose
the tests that were performed on
Kennedy, whose seizure was wit-
nessed by several fellow senators
seated with him at lunch.
NEW YORK
Madoff investors to
get small return
Investing a dollar and getting 10
cents back in return is a bad deal
even in today's market. But recov-
ering 10 cents on the dollar might
be optimistic for investors who
gave their cash to Bernard Madoff.
Moreover, they face a years-long
process to get any money back as
investigators search to find Mad-
off's assets. Dozens of lawsuits
and the possibility the fraud was
committed over decades makes
the chance of recovery even more
difficult.
Madoff has become one of the
most vilified people in America
since news broke Dec. 11 that he
had confessed to running a giant
Ponzi scheme, paying returns to
certain investors out of the prin-
cipal received from others. He's
estimated to have duped investors
out of as much as $50 billion.
Experts agree that the first of
any recovery payments might be
years in the future.
"It will probably take between
one and three years," said Dana
Basney, director of due diligence
and forensic accounting services
for CBIZ MHM, LLC in San Diego.
it could take most of the upcoming
year to trace Madoff's funds and
accounts, he said.

Bush travels home
to Texas, met by
20,000 supporters
Waving cardboard red, white
and blue "W"s, thousands wel-
comed President George W. Bush
and his wife on Tuesday to their
post-presidential home in Texas.
"The presidency was a joyous
experience but as great as it was
nothing compares with Texas at
sunset," Bush said to cheers from
the crowd of nearly 20,000 as for-

mer first lady Laura Bush stood at
his side. "Tonight I have the privi-
lege of saying six words that I have
been waiting to say for a while - it
is good to be home."
In the hours leading up to his
return, excerpts of some of Bush's
speeches played on a large TV
screen, including remarks he made
to Congress shortly after the ter-
rorist attacks in 2001.
MOSCOW
Russia restarts gas
supplies to Europe
through Ukraine
Russia's Gazprom gas monopoly
says it has restarted gas shipments
through Ukrainian pipelines to
Europe after halting them nearly
two weeks ago amid a pricing dis-
pute.
Gazprom spokesman Boris
Sapozhnikov says EU-led monitors
will track the flow of the gas being
pumped into Ukraine. He says the
gas flow was restarted around 1030
Moscow time (0730 GMT) Tuesday.
Officials say it could take 36
hours for gas to reach consumers in
Europe.
Russia halted gas shipments
to Europe on Jan. 7 as it argued
with Ukraine over 2009 gas pric-
es. Europe gets about one-fifth of
its gas from Russia via Ukrainian
pipelines.
Supplies were restarted after
Russian and Ukrainian officials
signed a deal Monday that doubled
the price for supplies to Ukraine.

Obama sworn in, promises reform

Millions watch 44th
president take oath
WASHINGTON (AP) - Before
a jubilant crowd of more than a
million, Barack Hussein Obama
claimed his place in history as
America's first black president,
summoning a dispirited nation to
unite in hope against the "gather-
ing clouds and raging storms" of
war and economic woe.
On an extraordinary day in
the life of America, people of all
colors and ages waited for hours
Tuesday in frigid temperatures
to witness the moment as a young
black man with a foreign-sounding
name took command of a nation
founded by slaveholders. It was a
scene watched in fascination by
many millions - perhaps billions
- around the world.
"We gather because we have
chosen hope over fear, unity of

purpose over conflict and discord,"
the nation's 44th president said.
The presidency passed to Demo-
cratObamafromRepublicanGeorge
W. Bush at the stroke of noon, mark-
ingone of democracy'sgreatestgifts:
the peaceful transfer of power.
But a stark transfer all the same.
In one of the new administration's
first acts, Obama ordered federal
agencies to halt all pending regu-
lations until further review - this
after Bush's final weeks raised
heated debate over rushing new
rules into effect on the way out
the door.
Obama plunges into his new job
in earnest on Wednesday, meet-
ing with his economic team and
Iraq advisers while Congress gives
his economic revival plan a going-
over and takes up the nomination
of Hillary Rodham Clinton to be
secretary of state. Her confirma-
tion has been held up for now by
Republican concern over the foun-

dation fundraising of her husband,
the former president.
The ne'w president had been
buoyant and relaxed through the
three days of pre-inaugural festivi-
ties. But he seemed somber as he
stood on the Capitol steps, placed
his left hand on the Bible used by
Abraham Lincoln and repeated
the inaugural oath "to preserve,
protect and defend" a Constitution
that originally defined blacks as
three-fifths of a person. A deafen-
ing cheer went up.
"What is required of us now
is a new era of responsibility
- a recognition, on the part of
every American, that we have
duties to ourselves, our nation,
and the world, duties that we do
not grudgingly accept but rather
seize gladly," Obama said. "This
is the price and the promise of
citizenship."
Tuesday was a day of high spir-
its - jarred by sudden concern

about the health of Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, a legendary Democrat
who is suffering from brain can-
cer and was rushed to a hospital
from a Senate luncheon after the
swearing-in. "My prayers are with
him and his family and (Kennedy's
wife) Vicki," Obama said. Later, fel-
low Sen. John Kerry of Massachu-
setts said Kennedy was laughing
and joking at the hospital and itch-
ing to get back to work.
On the inaugural parade route,
Obama and his wife, Michelle,
climbed out of the heavily armored
presidential limousine and walked
a few blocks along famed Pennsyl-
vania Avenue, waving to adoring
crowds under the watchful eyes of
security agents.
Obama wove a thread of person-
al responsibility and accountability
through his inaugural address, an
18-minute sermon on civic duty.
A liberal Democrat proposing bil-
lions of dollars in new spending,

Obama nonetheless spoke of the
limits of government.
"It is the kindness to take in a
stranger when the levees break,
the selflessness of workers who
would rather cut their hours than
see a friend lose their job which
sees us through our darkest hours,"
he said. "It is the firefighter's cour-
age to storm a stairway filled with
smoke, but also a parent's willing-
ness to nurture a child, that finally
decides our fate."
Obama's 10-year-old daughter,
Malia, aimed a camera ather father
as he spoke. Michelle leaned onto
the edge of her seat, body tensed
and brow knitted.
"Starting today, we must pick
ourselves up, dustourselves off and
begin again the work of remaking
America," Obama said.
He alluded to the inability - or
unwillingness - of Americans to
adjust to the passing of an industri-
al-based economy.

Financial stocks see
double digit declines
NEW YORK (AP) - The dawn
of the Obama presidency could
not shake the stock market from
its dejection over the rapidly
deteriorating state of the banking
industry.
Financial stocks, many of them
falling by double digit percent-
ages, led a huge drop on Wall
Street Tuesday that left the major
indexes down more than 4 percent
and the Dow Jones industrials
down 332 points. Although trad-
ers on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange paused to watch
the inauguration ceremony and
Obama's remarks, the transition
of power didn't erase investors'
intensifying concerns about strug-
gling banks and their impact on
the overall economy.
The market's angst, which began
with multibillion dollar losses
reported last week by Bank of
America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.,
intensified-after the RoyalBank-of_
Scotland's. forecast that its losses
for 2008 could top $41.3 billion.
The collapse in bank stocks was
swift: State Street Corp. plunged 59
percent, Citigroup fell 20 percent
and Bank of America lost 29 per-
cent. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 69
percent in New York trading.
"The reason we're having a
panic drop is the fact that Europe
is catching our cold, and we could
have deeper and deeper problems
that could require more and more
money. And eventually the govern-
ment is going to have to stop spend-
ing," said Keith Springer, president
of Capital Financial Advisory Ser-
vices. "It's a pretty dangerous situ-
ation tobe in."
The shrinking value of bank
stocks means the financial industry
accounts for less than 10 percent of

the Standard & Poor's 500 index for
the first time since 1992. At the end
of 2006, banks made up 22 percent
of the stock market benchmark.
And the market's retreat Tues-
day means Wall Street has eaten
through most of the advance it
made from Nov. 20 through Jan. 6.
The S&P 500, which had been up as
much as 24 percent, is now up only
7 percent from its November low.
Fears aboutbanking eclipsed the
shift in Washington. Royal Bank of
Scotland's forecast for what would
be the biggest loss ever for a Brit-
ish corporation left investors fear-
ful that government's would have
to nationalize banks to keep them
from collapsing. The British gov-
ernment injected more money into
the struggling bank Monday and
announced another round of bail-
outs for the country's banks.
State Street and Regions
Financial Corp., a bank with
branches primarily in the South-
east, both reported big earnings
drops Tuesday.
Acknowledging the global econ-
omy's woesObama suggested Wall,
Street would see greater oversight:
"Without a watchful eye, the mar-
ket can spin out of control," he said
in his address outside the Capitol.
Obama warned the economic
recovery would be difficult and
that the nation must choose "hope
over fear, unity of purpose over
conflict and discord" to overcome
the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression.
Investors are expecting Wash-
ington will be a central part of the
economic recovery. But the first
hours of the new administration
did little to ease their concerns.
"At this stage, markets in gener-
al and bank investors specifically
are really looking to government
as the way out," said Jack Ablin,
chief investment officer at Harris
Private Bank.

Despite rallies, no
plans to repair $2B
damage to Gaza
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -
Waving green Islamic flags atop
the ruins of Gaza, Hamas pro-
claimed victory in rallies attend-
ed by thousands of supporters
Tuesday, saying it survived Isra-
el's military onslaught despite the
destruction and massive death
toll suffered by Gazans.
Beyond its fiery words, how-
ever, Hamas offered no plans for
rebuilding Gaza, which suffered
some $2 billion in damage during
three weeks of fighting. Gaza's
borders with Israel and Egypt,
largely sealed since the Islamic
militants seized power 19 months
ago, remain closed and are unlike-
ly to open unless the militants
relinquish some control.
Israel has also claimed victo-
ry, but neither side was the clear
winner.
The fighting killed some 1,300

Gazans, the vast majority civilians,
andthousandsofPalestinianhomes
were destroyed. Israel emerged
from the war with relatively few
casualties - 13 dead, including 10
soldiers - but halted fire before
reaching its objectives. No interna-
tionally backed truce deal is yet in
place to prevent Hamas rocket fire
on southern Israel or arms smug-
gling into Gaza.
Israel had withdrawn the bulk
of its forces from Gaza by Tuesday
evening, coincidingwiththe inau-
guration in Washington of Barack
Obama as president. However, the
temporary cease-fire remained
shaky. Israel's air force struck a
Gaza mortar squad after it shelled
Israel, the military said.
Hamas held more than a dozen
victory rallies across Gaza, choos-
ingbombed-outbuildings as back-
drops to underscore its message
of defiance and its claim to have
survived battle against a vastly
more powerful enemy.
Addressing a crowd near Gaza
City's demolished parliament
building, Ismail Radwan, a Hamas

leader, declared: "Hamas-today is.
more powerful." Nearby, militants
held up a huge banner proclaiming
in Hebrew: "Hamas is victorious.
Israel has been defeated."
A few hundred yards away,
U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon toured
the local U.N. headquarters,
inspecting damage from an Israe-
li shelling attack last week. It hit
three warehouses where flour, oil
and other food rations for Gaza's
needy were stored.
Piles of rice, beans and medi-
cine still smoldered Tuesday,
sending white smoke into the air.
Ban said he felt "utter frustra-
tion, utter anger" over the shell-
ing of. the compound and two
U.N. schools, and demanded a full
investigation. As he spoke, the
buzz of Israeli unmanned aircraft
could be heard overhead.
Israel has said troops respond-
ed to fire from militants from the
areas, a claim the U.N. has vehe-
mently denied.
During a tour, Ban was told
that hundreds of tons of food and
medicine were destroyed.

Blagojevich doesn't respond
to impeachment charges

Ill. Gov. missed
2nd deadline to
formally respond
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich on
Tuesday missed his second dead-
line for filing formal answers to
an impeachment charge, with a
Senate trial over his ouster now
less than a week away.
The second-term Democrat,
whose criminal lawyers quit his
impeachment defense in protest
of the trial's rules last week, had
until 4 p.m. to file a request to dis-
miss the charge and kill the Sen-
ate proceeding. Had he done so,
senators, sitting as judges in the
trial, would have voted on wheth-
er to grant the request.
As a result of his inaction, the
Senate will presume that the gov-
ernor pleads "not guilty" to the
charge and move toward opening
the historic trial on Monday, said
Toby Trimmer, spokesman for
Senate President John Cullerton.
Spokesman Lucio Guerrero said
he didn't know what Blagojevich
would do.
"He hasn't filled me in on his

plans," Guerrero said.
A newly sworn-in House
voted 117-1 Jan. 14 to impeach
Blagojevich on a charge that he
abused his power as governor.
Blagojevich was issued a Senate
summons that day and had had
until Saturday to file a document
answering charges in the case,
but did not, Trimmer said.
Blagojevich was arrested Dec.
9 on a federal complaint that he
tried to trade government action
for campaign contributions or a
high-paying job, and in one case,
'in exchange for firing unfriendly
newspaper editorial writers. Fed-
eral prosecutors have until April
to indict him on the charges.
Chicago lawyers Ed Genson,
Sam Adam and his son, Samuel
E. Adam, gave up an impeach-
ment defense on Friday, with the
Adams comparing the process to
a "lynching." Genson distanced
himself from such talk but said
the Senate trial's outcome was a
"foregone conclusion."
Genson said he would still
defend Blagojevich on the federal
corruption charges.
Among complaints outlined in
a statement to the Chicago Tri-
bune, the Adams said they were

not given subpoena power to call
and question their own witnesses
at the Senate trial.
But that's the next deadline. By
4 p.m.Wednesday, both the House
prosecutor and the defense must
file all requests for subpoenas of
witnesses and documents, along
with requests for entering evi-
dence, including evidence not con-
sidered by the House committee
that recommended impeachment.
Both sides then have until 10
a.m. Saturday to respond to the
other side's requests for subpoe-
nas and evidence. TheSenate will
decide what evidence and subpoe-
nas are allowed.
Blagojevich was in Chicago's
federal courthouse Tuesday,
eludingthree reporters who were
waiting for him as he slipped in
and out of the building. One of
his attorneys, Sheldon Sorosky,
confirmed that the governor was
in the courthouse but did not say
why.
A person familiar with the rea-
son - who spoke only on condi-
tion of anonymity because the
information was confidential -
said the governor was there to
provide officials with a fresh set
of fingerprints.

Keeping a promise
Reducing college funding is a bad choice for state legislature
After a few months of breathing room, it looks like the Uni-
versity's funding is back on the state legislature's chop-
ping block. With deficits anticipated in Lansing, the state
legislature has started looking for costs to cut, and funding for the
University is a serious target. In such difficult economic times,
spending cuts will be necessary to balance the state's budget, but
these cuts shouldn't be aimed at education. Reducing funding to
public universities will devastate many students' ability to pay for
college, and by doing so, negatively impact Michigan's economy.
To invest in the state's future, the legislature needs to maintain its
current levels of funding for higher education in the form of schol-
arships and direct funding.

Michigan's Legislative Commission
on Government Efficiency - a taskforce
charged with finding ways to save the state
money - recently commissioned an educa-
tion study group to find costs for the state to
cut. Last week, the group released a report
outlining its recommendations. One such
recommendation was to eliminate the Mich-
igan Promise Grant Program, a major source
of the University's scholarship aid. Another
idea was an across-the-board.cut 7.1 percent
in funding to state colleges and universities.
The group also suggested some even less via-
ble options, like privatizing the University of
Michigan, which would actually require an
amendment to the state constitution.
These ideas range from disastrous to
absurd. And none of them take into account
the place higher education has in Michi-
gan's transforming economy. Canceling the
Michigan Promise Grant Program, which
accounts for 40 percent of all scholarship aid
to students at the University of Michigan,
would hamper the post-secondary educa-
tions of many students. As tuition continues
to increase each year and loan-based aid
becomes increasingly scarce, scholarships
are necessary to make college more acces-
sible and affordable. Though the abolition of
the program would mean short-term savings
for the state, countless students won't be able
to geta college degree without the assistance
of the scholarship program.
The proposed 7.1 percent cut in funding
to public universities is equally grim. The

University has had to raise tuition the past
few years even as state funding increased.
A decrease in funding would result in an
even higher tuition hike to offset the mas-
sive amount of lost revenue. The high cost
of tuition is already making college an
impossible dream for some students - even
higher costs would deter potential college
applicants from even applying to the Uni-
versity and stop many who were accepted
from attending.
But decreasing funding to higher educa-
tion affects more than just students who
depend upon scholarships and reasonable
tuition. As the state's economy reduces its
emphasis on heavy manufacturing, it will
need workers with new talents and skill sets.
Institutions of higher learning provide these
skills and are necessary for creating and con-
tinuing economic growth into the future.
To protect such an important component
for the state, lawmakers need to trim the
budgets of other discretionary items. There
are areas of the state budget than can bet-
ter absorb cuts - Michigan's dysfunctional,
costly corrections system is probably one of
those areas.
As money dries up in Lansing, it's true that
the state legislature will have to make tough
decisions on how to re-allocate precious dol-
lars. But devastating funding for education is
not an acceptable way to cut spending. This
state simply can't afford to stop investing in
public universities that will be responsible
for developing tomorrow's workforce.

Making sense of Gaza

I

As an American Jew, I have been taught for my entire
life to support Israel in every situation without question.
My old Hebrew school teachers would probably say that
they taught students to be critical of both the Palestin-
ian and Israeli regimes, but I don't think it's a coincidence
that those teachers rarely, if ever, presented any of Israel's
decisions as wrong. I have spent nineteen years surround-
ed by pro-Israeli messages and images. I remain proud of
Israel, but only recently have I come to terms with how
limited my perspective has been. It is my hope that others
who have grown up in pro-Israel or pro-Palestine house-
holds can realize the same thing.
Due to the recent surge of violence in Gaza, campus
organizations like the pro-Israel Initiating Dialogue,
Education, and Advocacy and the pro-Palestine Stu-
dents Allied for Freedom and Equality have held rallies
and organized other events to raise awareness on cam-
pus regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Frustrat-
ingly, both sides promote rigid, one-sided views of the
issue, which leads to an even greater gap between the two
groups when they should be reaching for mutual under-
standing.
The fact that there has been violence ever since Israel
was created serves as evidence that no one - Israeli, Pal-
estinian, or otherwise - has yet grasped the full complex-
ity of the issue. And although Israel decided to end their
campaign on Sunday, I guarantee that this past month's
violence in Gaza will not be the final skirmish. As long as
each side expects the other to accept full responsibility,
peace in Gaza will not be possible.
Propaganda on either side of the argument is preva-
lent both on and off campus. Lately, the catchphrase that
seems to have attracted the most attention is "innocent
civilians." Depending on which side they support, Face-
book users can donate their statuses to either display how
many Palestinian civilians have been killed or how many
rockets have been launched at Israelis in the recent Gaza
skirmish. Pro-Palestinian students have set up vivid dis-
plays of wounded Palestinians to attract support. In the
e-mail I received about the Israel rally, the sender used
"innocent civilians" twice in the first sentence. These
images and slogans provide sad reminders of the number

of victims in this war. But, more importantly, they are
also ploys intended to convince spectators of the oppos-
ing side's cruelty. Appeals made about innocent civilians
are frequently one-sided and avoid the harsh truth that
both Hamas and the Israeli Defense Forces kill innocent
civilians.
In promoting their interests, pro-Israeli and pro-Pales-
tinian organizations frequently deny their own role in the
conflict and place complete responsibility on the other side.
SAFE's recent viewpoint in the Daily (An appeal for human
rights, 01/15/2009) states, "Any ceasefire is destined for
failure as long as Israel and the international community
refuse to examine the core of the conflict." Similarly, the
Israeli government's assurance that it is taking every pre-
caution it can to protect Palestinian civilians does not seem
to be convincing the rest of the world. Every student who is
concerned about the situation in Gaza needs to understand
that attempts to place blame on one side and not the other
are oversimplifications.
All those who are hoping for a solution to this conflict
need to learn as much as they can about both the Palestin-
ian and Israeli viewpoint. As astarting ground, pro-Israel
students need to understand that supporting Palestine
is not synonymous with supporting Hamas, and that
although the Israeli government says it's doing all that
it can to prevent the deaths of Palestinian civilians, this
statement may not be viewed as adequate justification for 4
the large civilian death toll. Similarly, pro-Palestinian
students need to understand that Israelhas good reason to
believe that self-defense is necessary in Gaza, that nego-
tiating with an organization such as Hamas is extremely
difficult and that Israel has a right to exist because this
world needs a Jewish state.
I may not be an expert, but I do know that those who
are concerned need to educate themselves and engage
in a respectful dialogue. Students need to be critical of
the information they receive. On a campus with a diverse
population of pro-Israel and pro-Palestine students, I
think the most important thing any of us can do is talk
to each other.

an interest in campus issues to become editorial board members.

high points (the jangling, higher
energy "The Palace at 4 AM" for
one), butmostlythe albumremains
stagnant and stretched, revealing
a man who really doesn't know
where some lines should go and
possibly doesn't even care.
Get Guilty stands for the oppo-
site principles of The Slow Wonder
and proves that Newman might've
left his quick-hitting, spontaneous
self in the rear view mirror. Tracks
like"The Changeling(Get Guilty),"
with its dull waltz beat and "Get
guilty, kid" refrain are drowsy at
best. "Elemental," with its sooth-
ing guitar progression, yearns for
a shot of caffeine, a quicker pace
and at least some sense that New-
man wants to sing the damn song.
Aside from the entrance of the
faux-organ keyboards, the song
drags. "All of My Days and All of
My Days Off" trudges along in
three feet of snow; echoing pat-
terns of "All of my days" might
make the song catchy, but never
quite for the right reasons.

Lacking in gusto,
but marginally
successful
nonetheless.
Maybe Get Guilty would have
been better off as a New Pornog-
raphers's album, but either way,
A.C. Newman just seems a bit out
of his element here. Sure, a bunch
of worthy singles pop up, but that's
not what we should expect. It's
understandable that he doesn't
exude the same energy he did ear-
lier in his career, but it's a shame
because his best came with that
sort of gusto. Maybe his opening
lines aren't quite what they should
be, but that's the least of his prob-
lems now.

greaser who prefers Elvis to
Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis.
He's the bad boy who reluctantly
swallows his pride and achieves
redemption. While the movie fea-
tures a great cast of loveable goofs,
Rourke is Levinson's champion of
defiant juvenescence.
This young, ceaselessly charis-
matic leading man with an effem-
inate touch is definitely not the
same character that leads in Dar-
ren Aronofsky's "The Wrestler."
In the new film, Rourke plays
washed-up has-been Randy "The
Ram" Robinson. Robinson is old,

beaten, scarredi-and tired To sayt
the years haven't been kind to him
would be a gross understatement.
That old cliche doesn't even begin
to paint the picture of the pitiable
character Rourke inhabits.
If "Diner" is about holding onto
the past as a nostalgic reflection,
"The Wrestler" is a picture about
the inability to overcome the past.
Rourke's Randy is a professional
wrestler 20 years out of his hey-
day. The fans who once came in
droves to watch him are now far
-fewer in number, gathering in
hotel banquet halls and commu-
nity centers. He. remains intui-
tively in the guise of Randy "The
Ram" - his real name is Robin
- because he can hardly face the
real world.
One of the most intriguing
facets of Rourke's performance
is the undeniable and unsettling

TV REVIEW
Even Swayze can't save 'The Beast'

By CAROLYN KLARECKI
For the Daily
Apparently, the people at A&E
thought that casting a big-name
actor and giv-
ing him a missile
launcher was all
it would take to TM Best
create a success-
ful high-action Thursdays
crime show. They at10 p.m.
were mistaken. A&E
A&E's new
action drama
"The Beast" fails miserably. Nei-
ther exciting nor clever, the show
is yet another indicator of Patrick
Swayze's ("Roadhouse") status as
a has-been.
Swayze plays Charles Barker,
an experienced undercover FBI
agent whose unorthodox investiga-
tion methods - yes, the shoot first,
ask later gag, again - are frowned
upon by his colleagues. For an
undisclosed reason, Barker selects
young Ellis Dove (Travis Fimmel,
"Restraint") to be his partner and
he trains him in his reckless tech-
niques. Despite Barker's harsh
treatment of his apprentice, Dove
comes to respect and even admire
him. But Dove's loyalty will be
tested this season as the FBI enlists
him to watch and report Barker for
illicit behavior.
In the premiere, Barker and Dove
go undercover to expose gangsters
accused of weapon smuggling. This

plot-line takes up a large portion
of the show, even though it's never
made clear who these gangsters
are, why they're smuggling weap-
ons or how the FBI knows about itL
"The Beast" tries relentlessly to
be suspenseful and shocking, but
it ends up vague, confusing and
not even remotely entertaining.
When Barker pulls out his gun in
the middle of a park and threat-
ens a woman, it's unclear who the
woman is, how she's involved in
the story and why he's threaten-
ing her. Similarly, when Dove has
to coerce a man into giving him
the launch codes for an oversized
rocket launcher, there are no clues
as to why he has the launch codes
or how the ordeal results in them
doing drugs together.
While it may be difficult for

for the confusion that the by some bad-ass action scenes.
Sadly, the little action that does
appear is stale and comes at ran-
dom moments. The only notable
ig, drawn-out instance of action occurs when
Swayze shoots a missile at a parked

glers that he couldn't possibly be
an undercover FBI agent. But this
brief minute of epic weaponry is

rs must've decided viewers macho dialogue and a sad attempt
e satisfied with long scenes to create a moral struggle. The
xplained gun-waving and excitement in these moments isn't
use rather than a plot they worth the pain of sitting through

the rest of the show.
"Beast" suffers from a serious
identity crisis. It's too over-the-top
and melodramatic to be considered
a serious action show - the sound
of squealing tires plays whenever a
car appears. Yet the drama justisn't
hard-edge enough for people to
overlook its unrealistic and poorly
developed plot.
It's unfortunate that Swayze
chose to involve himself in this
show given its complete lack of
promise. We can only hope that
the end of Patrick Swayze's career
will be quick and painless, unlike
the experience of watching "The
Beast."

GRAFFITI
From Page 1A
Area Association, said that once
vandals see graffiti on a property in
a certain area, they are more likely to
deface other properties in that area.
"If someone sees graffiti, they
assume that there aren't enough
eyes on it so it somewhat grows
from there," he said.
The purpose of the ordinance
was not to penalize people who are

The decisionto still consider a res-
olution concerning an international
conflict that is currently in the midst
of a cease-fire was addressed by
several members of MSA last night.
They said that since they believe the
situation continues to be a humani-
tarian crisis, the proposal is still
relevant. Additionally, they said that
the Middle East conflict in general is
a controversial issue that many stu-
dents care about and thus should be
taken up by the assembly.
Much of the sentiment from the
previous week's meetingwas echoed
last night, including passionate dis-
course on both sides of the issue.
Several people present at the
meeting argued that the proposal
was a means of helping those in need
during a time of humanitarian crisis.
"I'm a Palestinian, I'm a Jew,
I'm a Christian, I'm a person, I'm
a human," community member
Husan Ahmad said. "The thing here
is we have a matter that touched
not only Palestinian, but it touched
Christian, Jew, Hispanic; it touched
everybody in the world. The prob-
lem here we are facing is not Jewish,
it is Zionist."
Others argued that the resolu-
tion was one-sided and did not pres-
ent enough information about the
attacks on Israel leading up to its
campaign in Gaza.
"It makes no mention of Hamas
or what's going on in southern Isra-

night's MSA meeting about the assembly's resolution regarding the Gaza conflict.

el or that over a million Israelis are
living within range of rocket fire,"
Chinsky said. "If we want to get a
more balanced resolution, that's
something we can talk about in the
future, you don't have to be pro-Pal-
estinian or pro-Israeli to do that."
The issue of whether or not it is
appropriate for MSA to pass a reso-
lution about an international con-
flict was also apoint of much debate
last night.
LSA-SG Rep. Adam London, who
is not a member of MSA, said that as
a student government representative
himself, he does not think it is within
the assembly's parameters to pass an
amendment on such a global issue.
"We have a large view, and it's

important that what you say and the
actions you take should represent
those who voted for you," he said.
"Know when it's right not to get
involved in something that is really
more of an international concern."
Stenvig disagreed with London,
arguing that a student government
hasthe responsibility totake stances
on issues that many University stu-
dents are concerned with regardless
of their locality.
"To take a position as a group of
leaders that is elected is a tangible
thing that has an impact," Sten-
vig said. "We're not future leaders;
we're leaders today already, and we
have a responsibility to take posi-
tions like this."

INAUGURATION
From Page lA
Andrea Jones, president of
the University's chapter of the
NAACP, said the trip to D.C. made
Obama's historic election seem
more real.
"It was a moving experience,"
she said. "It makes me more hope-
ful for the next four years."
Jones said that despite her
group's early arrival, the city was
already crowded when she arrived
yesterday morning.
"We were there at 4:30 a.m. and
the streets were already getting
packed," she said.
In Ann Arbor, students, faculty
and other members of the Univer-
sity community gathered at sev-
eral watch parties around campus
to share in the historic event.
There was standing room
only at the Union Ballroom
where approximately 150 stu-
dents gathered to watch the
inauguration.
Throughout the ceremony,
the room was quiet, but students
stood to cheer and applaud Obama
when he was sworn in. When out-
going President George W. Bush
was shown on television, several
people in attendance snickered
and laughed at him.
LSA sophomore Mitch Crispell,
who watched the inauguration
from the Union, skipped class to
witness the event.
"My parents told me to go to
class," he said. "But I said ifI went
to class I would regret it for the
rest of my life and I really should
be in a place where I can be cel-
ebrating an incredible landmark."
Engineering senior Ashley Issa,
whoalsowatchedtheinauguration
in the Union, said she was excited
by the inauguration and thinks
Obama will be more responsive to
the American people.
"It's really one of our great

events in history," she said. "I see
him as someone who can better
represent all the different voices
that there are inthe US."
Across campus, a group of stu-
dents and faculty filled the Busi-
ness School's recently constructed
Blau Auditorium to watch Obama's
inauguration.
LSA junior Katherine Nasz-
radi, who watched the event in
the Business School, said words
couldn't describe how she felt.
"It's just so incredible," she
said. "It feels like a new era."
Business senior Elise Hutchin-
son, said she decided to watch the
inauguration from Blau Auditori-
um after her professor ended class
early.
"Our teacher let us out of class,
because it's something he defi-
nitely didn't want us to miss," she
said.
Pharmacy freshman Chris
Truong said watching the event
made him proud of the country we
live in today and ready to tackle
the troubles we currently face.
"It is something that all Ameri-
cans should be proud of," he said.
"Even though we have a lot of
problems today, a lot of work can
be done if we start it together."
LSA freshman Justin Schon,
who watched with other members
of the Honor's College commu-
nity in their Mason Hall commons
area, said he was impressed by
Obama's speech.
"I thought it was a fantastic
speech," he said. "He hit on all
the points that he should have
hit on and I was particularly
impressed that one of the first
words he said was the word
'humble,' which is a word I
would like to hear the president
say more often."
Brittney Miller, John A. Weiss,
Jr., Daily Staff Reporter Caitlin
Schneider and the Associated
Press contributed to this report.


victims of graffiti, Clark said, but to
stop the occurrence of vandalism in
the city.
In fact, the new ordinance
was scaled back from its original
draft presented to City Council in
December, which included a fine
of up to $500 for property owners
who didn't remove graffiti within
two to four days of discovering the
vandalism.
Business owners felt the fine was
too harsh and that property owners
were targeted too heavily.

"The revision is much better in
how it relates the original intent of
the ordinance to people," Clark said.
At the meeting, concerns were
raised by Ann Arbor residents that
the ordinance prioritized graffiti
removal in the city, which isn't worth
fighting with taxpayer money.
But City Council members said
that they remained confident that
the ordinance would be successful
in decreasing graffiti within the
city and proud of the collaboration
of many different city organiza-

tions.
Council member Margie Teall,
the senior sponsor of the proposal,
said that the 90-day window before
the ordinance takes effect will be
used to inform property owners
on how to remove the graffit-i. Sug-
gestions for removal included "Ele-
phant Snot" - a graffiti removal
treatment.
The progress of the ordinance
will be reviewed by City Council
at a meeting scheduled six months
from now.

STATE COLLEGE - In the
midst of a decade's worth of medi-
ocrity, the Michigan basketball
team has recently seen some of the
program's
highest MICHIGAN 58
highs in a PENN STATE 73
long time.
Somehow, it seems only fitting
that the Wolverines' lowest point so
far this year took place in a valley.
"We're just struggling in so many
areas," Michigan coach John Beil-
ein said. "Today, I don't think from
the beginningto the end, it was one
of our better performances."
Whether it was the Wolverines'
fatigue from playing its fourth Big
Ten game in11 days or the shock of
CBS personality and NCAA Tour-
nament regular Gus Johnson pro-
viding commentary for the Big Ten
Network, Michigan lost its third
straight game in a frustrating 73-58
defeat to Penn State.
"(We're) pretty down right now,"

effort tonight. We're not defending,
we're not shooting."
Although the two teams came
into the matchup in a statistical
deadlock, it was the Nittany Lions
that clearly dominated the contest.
Penn State shot 9-of-17 from behind
the arc as the Nittany Lions' guards
penetrated Michigan's defense with
ease and found open shooters. And
if Penn State wasn't scoring from
the outside, forward Jamelle Corn-
ley was dominating the interior.
"Cornley was going bananas in
the first half," Merritt said.
The forward scored 11 points and
grabbed eight rebounds in the first
frame. He finished with 17 points
and 11 rebounds.
Michigan had its worst 3-point
shooting game of the season, con-
verting on just five of 30 attempts.
Sophomore Manny Harris tied
a career low with four points on
just 1-of-9 shooting. And aside from
junior DeShawn Sims (21 points)
and freshman Stu Douglass (three

Sims was also the only Michigan
player to score in double figures.
"I can't really say," Harris said
when asked about Michigan's
shooting woes. "We shoot enough
in practice. Maybe we need to shoot
even more."
Beilein partially attributed the
poor shooting night to the Wolver-
ines' inability to find a rhythm on
the road.
"An important part of this game
was establishing a tempo, and we
did not," Beilein said. "You don't
see me get that upset with my team
at the beginning of the game. Itwas
'my turn' and 'your turn.' "
The Wolverines were 2-for-16
from behind the arc in the first half,
and it was the sixth straight half
that Michigan shot less than 50
percent from the field.
Despite anotherforgettable first
half, Michigan trailed by just seven
going into the break. But a quick 8-2
Penn State run early in the second
half put the contest out of reach.

26 in the second stanza.
Beilein even shook up the lineup
in the first half to try to find some-
one who would play with poise. He
putinsenior Jevohn Shepherd, who
hasn't played significant minutes
since Dec. 29 against North Caro-
lina Central, while playing Harris
for just 12 minutes.
In the next month, the sched-
ule only gets harder for the Wol-
verines. And for a team that relies
heavily on 3-pointers, shooting 26
percent frombehind the arc during
the past three games won't cut it for
the Wolverines.
Beilein said his teams at West
Virginia suffered through similar
slumps and that a shooting drought,
like the ones the Wolverines saw
last night, can end in an instant.
"One or two shots go in, and then
all of a sudden, it absolutely turns
around," Beilein said.
And the Wolverines need a turn-
around soon to havea realistic shot
at playing in the postseason.

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
During the Michigan hockey
team's recent six-game win streak,
the Wolverines averaged almost a
four-goal margin of victory. They
hadn't quite figured out how to win
a low-scoring nailbiter.
In fact, the
Wolverines' 1-0 NOTEBOOK
shutout of Bowl-
ing Green Saturday marked the first
time all season that they won a game
withoutcscoring at least three goals.
"We need to be in games like
this," Michigan coach Red Berenson
said after the victory. "I think it was
a good gut check for the team."
The CCHA basement-dwelling
Falcons held the Wolverines score-
less through 90 minutes. Midway
through the second period, sopho-
more defenseman Chad Langlais
fired a shot from the left point that
flew past Bowling Green goalie
Jimmy Spratt. A perfect screen from
junior forward Anthony Ciraulo
blinded the netminder.
Langlais credited Ciraulo, who
filled in for an ill Matt Rust, and his
line of Danny Fardig and Luke Glen-
dening for his goal.
Langlais' tally also marked the
first goal scored with senior goal-
tender Billy Sauer between the pipes
in almost 180 minutes of play.
"(Sauer) hadn't been able to win,"
Berenson said. "Finally, the team
scored a goal for him. ... You can't
win games if your team can't score."
Langlais, who said before the
season that he intended to be more
aggressive and add to the team's
offense, has followed through on his
word.
He tallied his first career goal in
the season opener against St. Law-
rence and has quietly accumulated
assists since then. Saturday's goal
gave Langlais his 14th point of the
season and put the Spokane, Wash.,
native into a tie for eighth place
among CCHA defensemen.
The sophomore has also emerged
as one of the league's top point men
for power plays. Michigan assistant
coach Billy Powers said in Octo-
ber that Langlais' vision on the ice
makes him a good "quarterback" for
the power-play unit.
GETTING ROUGH: With two sec-
onds left in Saturday's game, both
teams finally snapped.
Seven penalties were dealt -
three to Michigan players - after
a handful of players dropped their
sticks and traded punches after the
whistle.
Referees called 46 combined
penalties in the series, including
three majors. Hits echoed loudly in

the cozy confines of the BGSU Ice
Arena Saturday night.
The hit that caused the most con-
cern for the Wolverines came 23
seconds into the first period of Sat-
urday's game. Junior defenseman
Chris Summers got slammed into
the boards in front of the Falcon
student section and didn't get up for
a few minutes. Berenson said Sum-
mers suffered a head injury.
Summers, the team's acting cap-
tain, was forced to watch the rest of
the game from the stands with the
scratched players. He said he felt
dizzy after the hit and was taken
out of the game for precautionary
reasons.
With Summers out of commis-
sion, the Wolverines played with just
five defensemen. Early in the third
frame, that number almost became
four. Sophomore Tristin Llewellyn
limped off the ice with what looked
like a left knee injury after Falcon
Josh Boyd clipped him near center
ice. Llewellyn returned to the game
and was sporting an ice pack on his
knee after the game.
"We've been dealing with inju-
ries all season, so it's nothing new
to us," added Langlais, adding that
some defensemen saw more ice time
than usual and played well.
It marked the first time all year
the Wolverines lacked aplayer wear-
ing a letter on the ice. After senior
captain Mark Mitera suffered an
ACL in the season-opening game in
October, Summers began wearing
a 'C,' and Berenson didn't appoint
another alternate captain.
And with both Mitera and Sum-
mers sitting in the stands Saturday,
sophomore forward Louie Capo-
russo and junior defenseman Steve
Kampfer represented Michigan
when talking to referees about pen-
alties and a disputed goal.
Summers didn't practice Mon-
day, but the trainers cleared him to
play in yesterday's practice and this
weekend. Summers said yesterday
he felt a little sluggish since he hadn't
been on the ice for a few days.
NOT QUITE: All weekend, senior
forward Tim Miller kept finding
himself with the puck in front of the
net, including three good scoring
chances.
But without a little puck luck, he
couldn't get past Spratt.
It appeared Miller figured out
the secret to success late in the
third period of Saturday's game. He
poked the puck into the net, which
elicited a red light and cheers from
the Michigan contingent of fans.
But when the referees reviewed
the play, they ruled that Spratt had
held the puck long enough to war-
rant a whistle before Miller's shot.

Tis is the lowest of the lows

STATE COLLEGE -
ast month, Michigan men's
basketball coach John Beil-
ein wasn't quick to jump to
conclusions.
In his postgame press confer-
ence following
the Wolverines'
upset over then-
No. 4 Duke, Bei-
lein called this
season a "roller-
coaster," saying
his young team
would encoun- RUTH
ter both ups and LINCOLN
downs this sea-
son.
"We don't want to go the other
way, but experience tells you that,"
Beilein said on Dec. 6. "This is the
good part of the rollercoaster."
But after last night's 73-58 loss
to Penn State, it's clear that Michi-
gan has not only fallen hard but dug
itself into a deep hole with poor
shooting and even worse defense.
Rebounding from this low point
will require a little more than a

comeback win in overtime. Maybe
Beilein can get some West Virginia
mining equipment to help out the
Wolverines.
But until something changes, the
chance of climbing out of this dead
space is looking grim.
The Wolverines shot a season-
low 16.7 percent from behind the
arc and allowed 36 points in the
paint.
Entering last Wednesday's game
against Illinois, the Wolverines
averaged 73 points per game. Since
then -three games and seven days
later - Michigan hasn'tscored more
than 58 points in any contest.
"This was disappointing just
from a standpoint that we're just
struggling in so many areas," Beil-
ein said.
The remainder of the season has
only three "gimme" games, if that.
The rest are filled with the likes of
Michigan State at home and Pur-
due, Wisconsin and Minnesota on
the road.
The last 12 games, five home
games and seven road ones, will be

an uphill battle. And with the Wol-
verines struggling, it could get ugly.
I'm not saying it's easy to win on
the road in the Big Ten. Just look
at the Boilermakers. Purdue, the
media's pick to win the Big Ten this
season, also lost in State College
and was a missed Northwestern
layup away from being humiliated'
in Evanston.
But Purdue didn't fall behind by
26 points in Happy Valley.
Sophomore Kelvin Grady noted
the frustration he's felt over the span
of these lastfewgames.
"It's just tough right now," said
Grady, who scored three points on
1-of-5 shooting. "We're not shoot-
ing the ball well, and the chemis-
try's not there. We've got a lot of
things that are correctable that we
can fix."
That chemistry following the
team's upsets over Duke and UCLA
was so apparent it practically
smacked you in the face.
But it's gone now.
In each of Michigan's three con-
secutive losses, there's been just one

Wolverine stepping up each time.
Last night, it was junior forward
DeShawn Sims's 21 points and 11
rebounds that carried his limping
team to the finish. Manny Harris,
who entered the game as the confer-
ence's leading scorer at 18.8 points
per game, failed to show up.
Harris's second-halfheroicsbhave
carried this team before. But last
night, he looked almost timid and
afraid to drive. He finished with
four points, which tied a career low
dating back to last season.
Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions
lit up the Bryce Jordan Center with
four players in double figures.
Michigan needs that same bal-
anced offensive attack to finish this
season with its head up.
Beilein said after the loss to Wis-
consin on New Year's Eve that it's,
sometimes a loss that's the turning
point in a team's season.
This loss could be a turn for the 4
worst.

simply gave them failure at Syracuse.

The Orange went 10-37, includ-
ing 3-25 in Big East play, during his
only head-coaching gig.
Robinson's sound bites, or
Gregisms, were widely mocked. He
once said the team's attitude "can
maybe snowball into something
that can catch fire."
In July, Syracuse's top-rated
recruit decommitted in favor of
Central Michigan because the Mid-
American Conference Chippewas
were more attractive than Syra-
cuse.
Because Rodriguez spends so
much time with the offense, his
defensive coordinator almostserves
as the head coach for half the team.
So it's tough to completely ignore
Robinson's shortcoming with the
Orange.
But Rodriguez has a record of
making the right choice here. He's
in his fourth head coaching job.
And for the fourth time, his defen-
sive coordinator in year one won't
see year two.
Phil Elmassian was ousted after
one year at West Virginia. His
defensive coordinator at Glenville
State retired. And football was
dropped at Salem following Rodri-
guez's first year there.
After suffering losing seasons in
the first year of his last three jobs,
Rodriguez found the right coordi-
nators to help turn his programs
around.
Rodriguez hired Todd Graham
and Jeff Casteel as co-coordina-
with a wealth of knowledge who
the players really respond to. His
season here in 2004 produced one
of the best defenses in Texas his-
tory and helped set the stage for
our National Championship season
in 2005."
But at Syracuse, Robinson posted
a dismal 10-37 record, never finish-
ing higherthan seventh place in the
eight-team Big East conference.
Of the nation's 119 teams, Syra-
cuse posted the 101st ranked scor-
ing defense last season.
Though he immediately threw

tors at West Virginia. Dean Hood
moved from offensive to defensive
coordinator at Glenville State.
Graham is the head coach
at Tulsa, which went 11-3 and
trounced Ball State in the GMAC
Bowl this year.
Casteel, still at West Virginia, is
one of the most-respected defen-
sive coordinators in the nation.
And Hood is the head coach at
Eastern Kentucky, which quali-
fied for the Football Championship
Subdivision playoffs this year.
Can Robinson live up to that
pedigree? After he failed miserably
once realizing his lifelong dream of
becoming a head coach, my biggest
question is whether he can show
the same fire he did with the Bron-
cos in the 1990s.
But a story relayed by Nick San-
tiago, a defensive tackle at Syracuse
last year, provides some relief.
Robinson used to call the Orange
into a huddle onthe field after their
pregame warm-ups. He delivered
impassioned speeches and got so
fired up he would jab at the players
on the inner part of the circle.
Before a game earlier this season,
Robinson hurt his hand because he
hit a player so hard.
Maybe Coach Rob will be good
enough, after all.
Coach Rod better hope so. His

1 813 The Michigan Daily - Wednesday, January 21, 2009

In a league with the devilamr

e trailed 4-3 with two
outs and the bases load-
ed in the bottom of the
sixth and final inning. Standing in
the coach's box alongside the first
base line, I glanced at my scorecard
to find, regrettably, that Aaron was
our next batter. "Shit," I muttered
to myself. "Anyone but Aaron."
This past summer was my third
year of coaching youth baseball.
Usually, the scores of the games
were inconsequential, these being
eight- to ten-year-olds, but our
team was 0-11 and this was our last
game. For the kids' sake, we need-
ed to win once. A 1-11 season spells
dignity; the tacit recognition that
victory is possible even if infre-
quent. Not so with 0-12, a Little
League record so odious it's liable
to haunt a player through their
teens and into middle age when,
invariably, his own children will
be pressured into sports to atone
for their parent's past failings.
But all hopes of forestalling
such a traumatic season rested on
the bat of our worst player, Aaron,
the single most sadistic nine-year-
old in the history of Minneapo-
lis' little leagues. The boy was an
unendurably rambunctious mon-
ster. He pulled teammates' hair,
destroyed equipment and yelled
insults at other players while they
batted, but it was his unwilling-
ness to throw a baseball that galled
me most. He preferred to drop-
kick the ball and shout "Goal!" at
the top of his lungs instead. This
happened more than a few times
in every game, which might have
been why this team had yet to earn
a victory.

At the plate, Aaron seldom
swung the bat. Having no faith
in his ability to come through in
the clutch in our last chance for a
win, I looked toward our bench to
see if he was ready to hit and get
it over with. Predictably, Aaron
was nowhere to be seen. "Where's
Aaron?" I yelled to the bench, but
the other coaches were already
searching for him. "Not again," I
thought. "Tell me he isn't crawling
under the bleachers. or throwing
other kid's gloves in the dumpster
behind the parking lot. Or digging
a - " This thought was abruptly
interrupted by a shrill chorus of
screams sounding from the oppo-
site end of the field, over which
I heard a coach yell, "Aaron, get
down from there!" To the crowd's
collective horror, Aaron had
scaled the backstop and was hurl-
ing rocks at the opposing team's
bench and fan section as he howled
"Goooooo Cubs!" with pernicious
glee. He had carefully prepared for
his onslaught, filling his pockets to
their brims with stones. "Rock-
ies suck!" he shrieked, launching
a rock at the opposing coach who
struggled to shield himself behind
his plastic clipboard.
Having witnessed several simi-
larly surreal Aaron outbursts over
the previous eleven games, my
resolve to intercede was torpid.
My only reaction was annoyance
at the fact that Aaron, who could
suddenly throw rocks with dan-
gerous velocity while clinging to
a chain link fence, had never once
been willing to throw a baseball in
a game.
Amidst barking dogs, screech-

ing children and mortified par- ting order and applied positions,

denial or obliviousness permitted
them to return after repeated pub-
lic embarrassments, I don't know.
But the league was never willingto
intervene for more than one game
and so the sideshow had continued
with impunity the whole season.
Now, at the end of our last game,
it took Aaron's older sister climb-
ing up the backstop to finally end
his violent spree. As she did this,
the umpire walked to me and said
that, because it was Aaron's turn
to hit, his slot would be consid-
ered an out, effectively ending the
game and with it our winless sea-
son. Concluding here, one could
rightly assert that the experience
with Aaron and his father harmed
everyone involved. And though we
loathed both of them by season's
end, what happened next showed
that everyone has the capability to
surprise.
Before I could freely tell off
Aaron's father for his dangerously
permissive parenting and chide
him for letting his son hurt other
people under the guise of individ-
ual expression, he presented our
four coaches with a white enve-
lope and walked away. We opened
it and found, to our astonishment,
the highly inappropriate but cer-
tainly not unwelcome sum of $800
in cash. And just like everyone has
the capability to surprise, every-
one too has their price. Our penni-
less college-aged coaches realized
then that, despite their myriad
faults, Aaron and his father were
really very nice people after all.

THE EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK with Jessica Vosgerchian
A look at the big news events this week and how important they really are. Conveniently rated from one tol0.
OUR PRESIDENT IS BLACK
History was made, replayed and weighed yesterday as Barack Obama
was inaugarated as the first black president oftthe United States. A
crowd of tens of thousands, crying and cheering, made pilgrimages to
10 D.C. to see it first hand. There, Obama setthe course for the country,
artfully disparaging Bush's tenure without a single overt attack. Rever-
end Joe Lowry gave an impassioned benediction, wherein he rhymed
"yellow man" with "mellow, man." And Dick Cheney also did what he
does best and nodded-off in the corner.
GRADUATE TO GOOGLER
University President Mary Sue Coleman announced that Larry Page,
the founder of Google, will deliver the commencement address at
this spring's graduation ceremony. Page, who graduated from the
University in 1995, will not be taking resumes - much to the dismay
of 2009's many jobless graduates. He will, however, be throwing
back shark bowls at Rick's.

ACTUAL CASH BACK
The Discover Student Card has one of the few

that offers actual money as an incentive. With
Discover's Cashback Bonus, you can earn back
up to 1 percent on general purchases and up to 5
percent on purchases made in specific categories

sounds like a great deal, but for general purchases
you'd have to spend at least $3,000 to reach the 1
percent threshold - that's right, $30. And for the
novice cardholder, this credit plan contains several
snares that could cost you more than $30 pretty
fast. Discover calculates the annual percentage
rate using the "two cycles average daily balance,"
rather than the standard one cycle method. This
means that an outstanding balance from one month
will come back to haunt you the next - even if you
paid it off, the interest rate that resulted tram that
balance will be figured into the calculation of your

their pocketbooks a little harder,
but they also realize the value of the
things you can't account for in dol-
lars and cents.
As philanthropy has become
increasingly difficult, many large
auto industry firms have withdrawn
some or all of their funding of stu-
dent organizations like the Michi-
gan Formula SAE and Michigan
Baja Racing teams.
But team leaders said automotive
firms' struggles to find room in their
budgets for sponsorship have led
them to step up collaboration with
student organizations, contributing
their expertise, facilities and sup-
plies instead of cash.
Engineering junior Katherine
Lapham, the business director for
the University's Formula SAE team,
said the organization used to rely on
large donations fromcompanies like
Ford to build its car and compete in
annual events. Although Ford and
other supporters have scaled back
their donations in recent years, the
team has compensated for those
losses, often through collabora-
tive efforts that have improved the
team's relationship with sponsors,
she said.
"With GM and Ford cutting back
with everything, a lot of their sup-
plierscan help us more because they
have a lot more free time," Lapham
said. "They can't give us funding,
but they can help us machine, or
use their facilities. If we need some-
thing, we can ask them."

Michigan-based automotive firms
that have scaled back their mon-
etary donations have instead given
the team free parts and technical
support, often offering the chance
to use new technology in exchange
for their feedback. Others, like Pratt
& Miller Engineering, a New Hud-
son-based firm that specializes in
performance vehicles, have offered
the team access to its facilities after
hours, Lapham said.
Dean Guard, the coordinator of
GM's University of Michigan rela-
tions team, said he has pushed for
the company to continue donating
money to the University's vehicle
teams despite the company's finan-
cial struggles. That could change
this year because of unprecedented
pressure to cut back on costs, but
Guard said the company would con-
tinue to provide technical support
regardless.
"What does the future hold? I
couldn't tell you. We're obviously
in a very difficult time," Guard said.
"But even if we suffer a financial
obligations change, there's still an
awful lot we can do with very little
money and alot of our time."
Automotive firms have continued
to lend support to the student vehi-
cleteams and collaborative research
labs in part because the programs
have become important incubators
for future employees, Detroit Three
engineers said.
Fansler estimated that General
Motors has hired more than a dozen
University of Michigan students
who worked on GM-sponsored
research projects over the past
decade.

Many more have come from the
student vehicle teams, said Dean
Guard, chiefengineer ofGM's small-
block V8 engine program. He said
the automotive teams havebeen fer-
tile recruiting ground because they
allow GM to find engineers with the
interest and passion to make them
successful in the auto industry.
"There are plenty of good engi-
neers," Guard said. "We're not just
looking for good engineers. We're
looking for good engineers who are
passionate about vehicles."
Each year, the company offers
multiple scholarships to members
of the vehicle teams. Engineering
senior Andrew Kneifel, who has
received one of the scholarships
twice, said he has seen auto industry
officials continue to recruit on cam-
pus even though the slow economy
has prevented them from hiring at
the usual rate.
"It's been a great help to my per-
sonal educational expenses, but also
I see them building these relation-
ships with students, coming back to
career fairs," Kneifel said. "They're
still trying to develop relationships
with engineers."
While some students studying
automotive engineering said they
had begun looking for jobs in
other sectors, many said they
remain enthusiastic about work-
ing for the auto industry but have
acknowledged they might have
to wait a little while longer than
previously hoped.
Kneifel, a native of Rochester
Hills, said he hopes to find a job in
the auto industry but wasn't able
to secure a position last semester.
He said he plans to remain at the
University another year to earn
his master's degree and try again
afterward.
Jeremy Spater, a master's stu-
dent in mechanical engineering
who works on the HCCI research
project, said the slowdown in
hiring for automotive engineers
is discouraging but he doesn't
expect it to last.
"Right now, there are more
cars coming off the road than
there are being sold," Spater said.
"No, there's not better public
transportation now, and there's
no alternative to cars, so sooner
or later, people are going to have
to start buying them again."
RECHARGING FOR
THE FUTURE
Car sales fell across the board
last year as the economy strug-
gled. But because oftheir reliance
on large, gas-guzzling cars and
SUVs, Detroit's automakers were
hit hardest, which demonstrated
the importance of new technolo-
gies like the HCCI engine.
Fansler, the GM engineer, said

the University's expertise in engine
systems analysis will be crucial to
the development of alternative sys-
tems like electric fuel cells, which
many industry analysts expect to
become standard for many cars in
the near future. Advances like fuel
cells will help GM fill the technol-
ogy "pipeline" it will need to thrive
in the 21st century, Fansler said.
"We have to-do that, or we might
survive a little longer and find our-
selves in a similar fix a little farther
down the road," he said.
With GM banking much of its
future on the success of the all-
electric Chevrolet Volt, scheduled
to launch in 2010, the University's
importance as a research partner
has grown.
The University's Collaborative
Research Laboratory in Advanced
Vehicle Manufacturing, led by
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Jack
Hu, has begun researching assem-
bly processes for the batteries GM
plans to use in the Volt.
And last week atthe North Amer-
ican International Auto Show in
Detroit, GM extended its research
relationship with the University by
announcing plans for a five-year, $5
million joint program to research

batteries for electric vehicles.
The GM/UM Advanced Battery
Coalition for Drivetrains, led by
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Ann
Marie Sastry, will perform experi-
ments and simulations to help devel-
op the lithium-ion batteries being
developed for vehicles like the Volt.
Late last year, theUniversity and GM
announced plans to enroll 50 GM
engineers in Sastry's master's pro-
gram in energy systemsresearch.
Weinert, who is also director of
corporate and government relations
for the University's College of Engi-
neering, said these technologies -
developed in part at the University
- offer the domestic auto industry a
chance to turn the corner.
"Clearly, with what's happening
in the auto industry and what's hap-
pening with global climate change
and the energy challenges of the
country, everyone would agree that
electrification of the automobile
is a path that needs to be pursued,
and pursued rapidly," Weinert said.
"This work, for that very reason,
is potentially transformational to
this 100-plus-year-old industry. It's
an inflection point. We haven't had
many of those in the industry's his-
tory, but we're at one right now."

Job interviewing 101
Although the prospects certainly
look grim right now, it's a safe bet
that most students here will someday
have a job interview. In order to pre-
pare, you could always use the Career
Center as a resource. You could also
watch this video.
While waitingtobe called in forhis
interview, Ben Schwartz is engrossed
in the kid's magazine "Zoobooks."
An assistant lets Schwartz know that
Meredith is ready to see him, but
Schwartz says he isn't quite ready.
As Schwartz follows the assistant
through the hall, he suggests they
grab dinner sometime. Scornful and
impatient, the assistant scoffs, "No, I
don't think so." Schwartz then asks
for her name and tries to slip money
into her jacket pocket. She disgust-.
edly pushes him away from her.
Now comes the interview. Mere-
dith starts by asking Schwartz about
his job experience. "So what is Omni-
core?" she says. "Isn't Omnicore the
name of the company from that
movie, 'Eobocop' ?" "Oh, so you've
seen the movie," Schwartz says,
sounding surprised. Meredith then
asks about another one of Schwartz's
employers, called "Skynet." Which
Meredith identifies as being from
"The Terminator." "Ahh, you see a lot
of movies," Schwartz says.
He ends by asking her out to din-
ner and then offeringher money.

A winter remedy - Yeah, we know it's cold. On
your dreadful walks to class, you've probably often
regretted the fact that you left in the first place.
Well, it's time to stop griping and take action. Go
to Meijer and stock up on the necessary goods: a
month's worth of microwave meals, whiskey and
coffee. Find studious friends to take notes for you in
lecture, and don't bother with discussion sections.
It'll be spring before you know it.

STUDY OF THE WEEK
Coffee consumption can reduce
some oral cancers
Drinking coffee can reduce the risk of getting cancer in the oral
cavity or throat, according to a study recently published in the Amer-
ican Journal of Epidemiology by researchers at Tohoku University,
Sendei, in Japan.
In the study, the researchers examined data from the Miyagi
Cohort Study in Japan, analyzing more than 38,000 people aged 40
to 64 years old with no previous experience with cancer. In particu-
lar, the researchers looked at participants' diets, including their cof-
fee consumption.
After 13 years of close observation, the researchers found that of
the 38,000 participants, 157 people developed cancer of the mouth,
pharynx and esophagus. Then, they discovered that compared with
people who didn't drink coffee, those who consumed one or more
cups per day proved to be half as likely to develop these oral cancers.

GREASINGTHE WHEELS
The Detroit Three used to be big-time benefactors to the University. But needing a technological edge in the face of
economic uncertainty, automakers are looking to the school for more than good will.

As difficult as it might be
to imagine today, there was a
time when people worried the
domestic auto industry was giv-
ing the University of Michigan
too much money.
It was 1923, less than two
decades after the founding of the
Ford Motor Company, and the
pioneers of Michigan's booming
automotive industry had already
begun pouring money into their
state's flagship university.
Upton Sinclair, an eminent
muckraking journalist of the
day, nicknamed the University
of Michigan "the University of
Automobiles" - suggesting that
the influence of the auto indus-
try could corrupt the academic
independence of the University.
"The University of Michigan
is another of these huge educa-
tional department stores," he
wrote, "a by-product of the sud-
den prosperity of the automobile
business."
Indeed, two of Ford's initial
shareholders, James Couzens
and Horace Rackham, were two
of the University's biggest bene-
factors.
Couzens gave the Univer-
sity $600,000 in 1923 for the
construction of a dormitory -
Couzens Residence Hall - on
what was then the campus's
northeastern fringe. A decade
later, Rackham's wife Mary gave

the University $2.5 million for
the constructionofthe Rackham
Building and another $4 million
for graduate-level research, pro-
viding the foundation for the
University's Rackham School of
Graduate Studies.
Auto industry money helped
grow the University to its cur-
rent size and prominence. The
University's Dearborn campus
was created in 1956 after the
Ford Motor Company donated
Henry Ford's 210-acre estate and
$6.5 million to the University,
and a donation from CS. Mott,
an auto industry pioneer who
was once GM's largest share-
holder, helped turn Flint Junior
College into a four-year program
administered by the University.
"The legacy of Ford is evident
in almost this whole campus,"
said Mary Lynn Heininger,
director of corporate relations
at the Dearborn campus. "They
have contributed to who we
are."
And yet, as much as the wealth
of the auto industry shaped the
University through the last cen-
tury,therelationship rarelywent
beyond philanthropy. Despite
their close proximity, the auto
industry and the University of
Michigan typically struggled to
establish lasting research rela-
tionships.
But the University's relation-

ship with the auto industry has MISSED
undergone a fundamental shift OPPORTUNITIES

transform the University into a
"reservoir of interesting ideas"
and one that can now help
Detroit's automakers solve their
long-term challenges.
"This is a place where new

faculty and departments, with
fewlong-term projects and little
central coordination.
Examples of the divide
between academia and indus-
try can be found in the dusty
archives of the University's
now-defunct Engineering
Research Institute, formed in
1948 to coordinate externally
funded research.
In 1955, Mechanical Engi-
neering Prof. R.G Folsom and
GM engineers developed a plan
to build a cutting-edge wind
tunnel where Folsom and col-
leagues could perform research
on vehicle aerodynamics.
GM's budget committee
had already approved the proj-
ect, but in June 1955, a letter
arrived from an attorney in the
company's patent division. The
research proposal had been
rejected.
The attorney cited a clause
in the contract that allowed the
University to publish research
without explicit permission
from GM. The research was of
a sensitive nature, he wrote,

By Gabe Nelson Daily Staff Writer

and the company didn't want
University faculty spilling trade
secrets.
Folsom, also the director of
the Engineering Research Insti-
tute, suggested that the contract
be changed so GM would have
the authority to reject the pub-
lication of research.
He met opposition from
administrators, including Col-
lege of Engineering Dean G.G.
Brown and University President
Harlan Hatcher, who acknowl-
edged that taking a hard line on
contracts would hinder indus-
try relationships but said the
University shouldn't allow a
sponsor to censor the publica-
tion of research for the benefit
of science.
Negotiations stalled, and
General Motors moved on.
Folsom continued to seek an
explanation from GM, and in
early 1957, one of the company's
researchers sent him a friendly
letter explaining what had gone

wrong. Disappointed, but with-
out a hint of bitterness, Folsom
wrote back.
"I believe this is very regret-
table, in view of our close geo-
graphical location and a desire
on both our parts to cooperate
for our mutual advantage," he
wrote. "I hope this unfortunate
experience will not deter either
of us from exploring possibili-
ties of mutual research activi-
ties in the near future. Thank
you for your continued interest
in the University."
By the next year, Folsom had
accepted an appointment at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti-
tute in Troy, N.Y., which had a
more flexible research relation-
ship with the auto industry.
"I was very happy to hear that
there are excellent relationships
between Rensselaer and Gener-
al Motors and it is my hope that
this cooperation will continue
to grow and prove of mutual
benefit," he wrote.

said.
Last year, the three CRLs
based at the University received
about $2.5 million, up from the
$1.1 million originally allocated
for the original satellite labora-
tory ten years earlier. Because
the CRLs are meant to func-
tion as partnerships, about half
of GM's money goes toward
research suggested by GM and

expertise in engine modeling
and simulation to help develop
GM's homogeneous-charge
compression ignition engine
(HCCI), a fusion of diesel and
gasoline engine technology that
increases fuel economy by about
15 percent and reduces emis-
sions.
But because the engine is
highly sensitive to tempera-
ture and pressure, it only works
under a very specific set of cir-
cumstances.
Last week in Assanis's lab,
four engineering graduate stu-
dents crowded around a con-
trol panel to monitor an HCCI
engine running in the next
room. GM provided the engine
and the funding for the research
project, an effort to devise valve-
timing schemes that expand the
range of conditions in which the
engine works.
GM demonstrated the tech-
nology last summer using a
Saturn Aura concept car. Sev-
eral carmakers are developing
the engine, but none have yet
announced plans to market it in
a vehicle.
Despite the strain of grow-

ing debt, GM recently renewed
contracts with two of the labs,
promising $6 million over the
next five years. This year, the
company must decide whether
to extend its contract with the
third laboratory, which studies
smart materials.
Fansler said GM's decision to
continue the partnership despite
the company's financial duress
shows faith that the University
will help the company attain
the technology necessary to stay
competitive.
"That we renewed the two
CRLs late last year, at a time
when our finances were not
looking very good and when we
were under a lot of public scruti-
ny, is a mark of how much value
we place on the research rela-
tionship with the University of
Michigan," he said.
