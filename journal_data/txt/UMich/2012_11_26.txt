LEGAL DISPUTE
After scandal,
UMHS warns
faculty, staff

Monday, November 26, 2012

Leaders stress
confidentiality as
a result of insider
trading allegations
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
Leaders of the University of
Michigan Health System sent
an e-mail to UMHS staff and
faculty on Saturday to address
Neurology Prof. Sidney Gil-
man's alleged involvement in
a $276-million insider trading
scheme.
The e-mail - sent jointly
by Ora Pescovitz, the execu-
tive vice president for medi-
cal affairs, UMHS CEO
Douglas Strong and Medical
School Dean James Wool-
liscroft - did not specifically
mention or condemn Gilman.
Instead, it stressed the impor-
tance of following the customs
established by the hospital
accreditation organization the
Joint Commission, the Ameri-
can Medical Association and
the National Institutes of
Health, in addition to their "our
own values of what is right."
However, UMHS - spokes-
man Pete Barkey confirmed
Sunday that the faculty mem-
ber referred to in the e-mail is
Gilman.
"This is an opportune time
for all of us in the Health Sys-
tem to reaffirm our commit-

ment to follow the highest
standards of integrity in the
conduct of research and in the
delivery of patient care," the
e-mail stated.
The message also warned
staff against releasing any non-
public information unlawfully.
"In our teaching, patient
care and research roles, we are
entrusted with confidential
information of many types, and
we work hard to never betray
that trust," the e-mail stated.
"We are proud of our rich leg-
acy and disappointed when we
fail."
Gilman served as the chair
of the Department of Neurol-
ogy from 1977 to 2004. In 2003,
the neurology service at Uni-
versity Hospital was named
"The Oilman Service" after the
renowned neurology professor
and an annual Sid Gilman and
Carol Barbour Lecture in Neu-
roscience was also established
that same year.
Barkey declined to comment
on why the e-mail was sent
to staff, noting that it was an
internal message.
Barkey said in a statement
Wednesday that Gilman has
remains a Neurology profes-
sor at the University, but his
involvement in the scheme is
being "carefully reviewed." He
said he had no further informa-
tion on Sunday.
Gilman was allegedly paid
$100,000 for non-public infor-
mation he gave to Matthew

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
CSG, RSG tussle
over ballot question

Decriminalization
efforts expected
to be led by cities,
municipalities
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
Nowadays there seems.to be
as many different opinions on
marijuana usage as there are
nicknames for the drug.
When.Colorado and Wash-
ington passed controversial
measures earlier this month to
legalize marijuana, many col-
lege students around the coun-
try rejoiced at the measures in
hope that their states would
soon follow suit. However, pub-
lic opinion polls show America
is heavily divided on matters
involving the popular street
drug, and experts say Michi-
gan legislators are reluctant to
make a move on the controver-
sial issue.
National statistics point to a

shift in attitudes towards mari-
juana legalization. According
to the Pew Research Center, 16
percent of Americans favored
legalization of the drugin 1990,
while the latest data collected
in 2011 puts that number at 45
percent.
If recreational marijuana
usage becomes legal in Michi-
gan, experts agree that it must
be done through a ballot peti-
tion as opposed to state leg-
islation. Though many states
are taking action on the issue,
Neil Yashinsky - the Oakland
County director of the Michi-
gan Chapter of the National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, an organiza-
tion that advocates for marijua-
na reform - said it's far more
likely that Michiganders will
see more municipalities slowly
legalizing the drug as opposed
to any sweeping state law.
This local approach was seen
most recently in the November
election, when five Michigan
cities - Grand Rapids, Detroit,

Starting today, all reviews
printed in the Arts section will no
longer be qualified by a star rating.
Instead, we are switching to a let-
ter-based graded system (A+, A, A-,
etc.) for reviews.
When the Arts editors and I dis-
cussed this change, we decided a
graded system will allow more flex-
ibility for our writers and provide
more accurate coverage for you,
our readers. As revealed through
our monthly qualitative analyses of
Arts content, a consistent problem
with reviews has been that the tone
of reviews does not match assigned
star ratings. We believe this issue
stems from the difficulty ofconcep-
tualizing the qualitative properties
of "stars": For example, what makes
a film, album, TV show or video-
game worth three stars instead of
three-and-a-half stars?
We chose a graded system
CRIME NOTES

because we thought it apropos to
our University audience and our'
role as a student newspaper. We
also found letter grades an easier
system to conceptualize: As stu-
dents, we can relate to the differ-
ence between a C+ and a B-, where
as the difference between a three"
and a three-and-a-half star review
is a harder to understand.w
This is a significant change to the
way the Arts section has worked,
and we'd appreciate your thoughts,
questions or criticism. Feel free to
e-mail me at Irburgin@michigan-
daily.com if you have any thoughts.

Utility worker punctured
pipe before Mass. gas blast

Blast injured
18, damaged 42
buildings

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP)
- A natural gas explosion that
injured 18 people and dam-
aged 42 buildings in Spring-
field's entertainment district
was blamed Sunday on a utility
worker who accidentally punc-
tured a high-pressure pipeline
while looking for a leak.
State Fire Marshal Stephen
Coan said the Friday night blast
in one of New England's largest
cities was caused by "human
error." He didn't name the
Columbia Gas Co. worker who
pierced the pipe while respond-
ing to reports of a gas leak.
The worker damaged the
underground pipe while using a
metal probe to locate the source
of the leak, Coan said. A flood of
gas then built up in a building
that housed a strip club, and
some kind of spark touched off
the blast, officials said.
Coan said the employee was

following older markings on a
sidewalk that indicated the loca-
tion of the gas line. He appeared
to be an appropriate distance
from the line, but the markings
were incorrect and the worker
accidentally punctured the pipe.
A message left for a Colum-
bia Gas spokeswoman wasn't
immediately returned. Colum-
bia Gas, a subsidiary of pub-
lic company NiSource Inc.,
announced earlier Sunday that
it planned to open a claims cen-
ter for residents and businesses
affected by the explosion at
City Hall on Monday.
Preliminary reports showed
the blast damaged 42 buildings
housing 115 residential units.
Three buildings were immedi-
ately condemned, and 24 others
require additional inspections
by structural engineers to
determine whether they are
safe. The building that housed
the Scores Gentleman's Club
was completely destroyed.
After the pipe was ruptured,
authorities evacuated several
buildings. Most of the people
injured were part of a group of

gas workers, firefighters and
police officers who ducked for
cover behind a utility truck just
before the blast. The truck was
demolished.
Some officials said it was
a miracle no one was killed.
Springfield Fire Commission-
er Joseph Conant praised the
actions of city firefighters.
"The firefighters did an
excellent job evacuating the
area which certainly prevented
additional civilian injuries and
saved many lives," Conant said.
Columbia Gas officials have
been cooperating with investi-
gators and have determined that
there are no more gas leaks in the
neighborhood, Mayor Domenic
Sarno said.
Coan said the investigation is
being turning over to the state
Department of Public Utilities.
It's not clear whether investiga-
tors will ever be able to deter-
mine what caused the spark
that ignited the explosion.
Springfield, which is 90 miles
west of Boston and has about
150,000 residents, is the largest
city in western Massachusetts.

Teenager dies, marks
first death reported
from street battles
CAIRO (AP) - Support-
ers and opponents of Egypt's
president on Sunday grew more
entrenched in their poten-
tially destabilizing battle over
the Islamist leader's move to
assume near absolute powers,
with neither side appearing
willing to back down as the
stock market plunged amid the'
fresh turmoil.
The standoff poses one of the
hardest tests for the nation's lib-
eral and secular opposition since
Hosni Mubarak's ouster nearly
two years ago. Failure to sustain
protests and eventually force
Mohammed Morsi to loosen con-
trol could consign it to long-term
irrelevance.
Clashes between the two sides
spilled onto the streets for a third
day since the president issued
edicts that make him immune to

oversight of any kind, including
that of the courts.
A teenager was killed and at
least 40 people were wounded
when a group of anti-Morsi pro-
testers tried to storm the local
offices of the political arm of
the president's Muslim Broth-
erhood in the Nile Delta city of
Damanhoor, according to secu-
rity officials.
It was the first reported
death from the street battles
that erupted across much of
the nation on Friday, the day
after Morsi's decrees were
announced. The officials, who
spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because they were not autho-
rized to speak to the media,
identified the boy as 15-year-old
Islam Hamdi Abdel-Maqsood.
The tensions also dealt a fresh
blow to the economy, which has
suffered due to the problems
plaguing the Arab world's most
populous nation since Mubarak's
ouster.
Egypt's benchmark EGX30
stock index dropped 9.59 per-

centage points Sunday in the
first trading session since Morsi
issued his decrees. The losses
were among the biggest since the
turbulent days and weeks imme-
diately after Mubarak's ouster in
a popular uprising last year. The
loss in the value of shares was
estimated at close to $5 billion.
The judiciary, the main target
of the edicts, has pushed back,
calling the decrees a power grab
and an "assault" on the branch's
independence. Judges and pros-
ecutors stayed away from many
courts in Cairo and other cities
on Sunday.
. But the nation's highest judi-
cial body, the Supreme Judiciary
Council, watered down its oppo-
sition to the decrees on Sunday.
It told judges and prosecutors to
return to work and announced
that its members would meet
with Morsi on Monday to try to
persuade him to restrict immu-
nity to major state decisions like
declaring war or martial law or
breaking diplomatic relations
with foreign nations.

that would end a violent rebel-
lion that has sucked in Uganda
and Rwanda, which both face
charges of backingthe rebels.
M23 President Jean-Marie
Runiga is leading the rebels in
the talks, according to Rene
Abandi, M23's head of external
relations.
Abandi said M23 representa-
tives met with Congolese Presi-
dent Joseph Kabila in a tense,
two-hour meeting that was also
attended by Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni.
"He tried to accuse us and we
also tried to accuse him," Abandi
said of the meeting with Kabila
on Saturday. "It was a meeting to
have a common understanding
of the principle of negotiation.
(Kabila) said he's ready to nego-
tiate directly with us."
But some Congolese officials
in the capital Kinshasa have said
there will be no talks with the
rebels unless they quit Goma.
A regional summit of the Inter-
national Conference on the
Great Lakes Region in Kampala
- attended by both Kabila and
Museveni - on Saturday called
on the rebels to leave Goma and
urged Kabila to listen to the
"legitimate grievances" of M23.
Despite the regional leaders'
demands for the rebel forces to
withdraw from Goma, M23 sol-
diers were visibly in control of
the city Sunday. M23 also still
held Sake, a contested town 15
miles west of Goma. The Congo-
lese army attacked the town Sat-
urday, but M23 retained control.

M23 President Runiga said
that withdrawal from Goma
was "under consideration" and,
while M23 did not oppose the
idea "in principle," no decision
had been taken yet, accord-
ing to M23 spokesman Lt. Col.
Vianney Kazarama, speaking to
the Associated Press. Runiga is
still in Kampala and no official
response to the demands from
the regional summit is expected
before his return to Congo, said
Kazarama in Goma.
"We are waiting to hear from
Runiga when he will be back
from Kampala," said Kazarama.
"Since May we have asked to
meet with President Kabila,"
said Amani Kabasha, M23's
deputyspokesman. "At least now
there has been contact. The door
is open for talks to find the dura-
ble peace that eastern Congo
needs."
Government troops remain
in Minova, 15 miles south of
Sake, following a failed attack
on M23 last Thursday. Unruly
Congo army soldiers had looted
residents for the third night
running, according to a United
Nations official in the town
who insisted upon anonym-
ity because he is not autho-
rized to speak to the press. U.N..
peacekeepers patrolled Minova
throughout the night to protect
civilians from the rampaging
government troops.
In Minova, Congo Gen. Fran-
cois Olenga, who was recently
named head of the Congolese
army, held meetings with area
commanders . "The country is
in danger. We cannot defend
our country with traitors," said
Olenga to The Associated Press.
Pickup trucks packed with
Congolese army soldiers armed
with automatic rifles and rock-
et propelled grenades sped
through Minova to regroup at
the local soccer stadium. Army
soldiers were also walking in the
streets, looking for food. Some
army soldiers were selling ciga-
rettes on the side of the road.
An M23 communique sent
Saturday night claimed that gov-
ernment regiments were mov-
ing into attack positions around
rebel-held territory.

Expiration of Kyoto Protocol adds
pressure to UN's climate talks

Developing
countries at risk to
not be able to adapt
to climate change
DOHA, Qatar (AP) - As
nearly 200 countries meet in oil-
and-gas-rich Qatar for annual
talks starting Monday on slow-
ing global warming, one of the
main challenges will be raising
climate aid for poor countries at
a time when budgets are strained
by financial turmoil.
Rich countries have deliv-
ered nearly $30 billion in grants
and loans promised in 2009, but.
those commitments expire this
year. And a Green Climate Fund
designed to channel up to $100
billion annually to poor coun-
tries has yet to begin operating.
Borrowing a buzzword from
the U.S. budget debate, Tim Gore
of the British charity Oxfam said
developing countries, including
island nations for whom rising
sea levels pose a threat to their
existence, stand before a "cli-
mate fiscal cliff?"
"So what we need for those
countries in the next two weeks
are firm commitments from rich
countries to keep giving money
to help them to adapt to climate
change," he told The Associated

Press on Sunday.
Creating a structure for cli-
mate financing has so far been
one of the few tangible outcomes
of the two-decade-old U.N. cli-
mate talks, which have failed in
their main purpose: reducing
emissions of heat-trapping gases
that scientists say are warming
the planet, melting ice caps, gla-
ciers and permafrost, shifting
weather patterns and raising sea
levels.
The only binding treaty to
limit such emissions, the Kyoto
Protocol, expires this year, so
agreeing on an extension is seen
as the most urgent task by envi-
ronment ministers and climate
officials meeting in the Qatari
capital.
However, only the European
Union and a few other coun-
tries are willing to join a second
commitment period with new
emissions targets. And the EU's
'chief negotiator, Artur. Runge-
Metzger, admitted that such
a small group is not going to
make a big difference in the fight
against climate change.
"I think we cover at most 14
percent of global emissions," he
said.
The U.S. rejected Kyoto
because it didn't cover rapidly
growing economies such as
China and India. Some hope for

delegates in Doha as work begins
on -drafting a new global treaty
that would also apply to develop-
ing countries including China,
the world's top carbon emitter.
That treaty is supposed to be
adopted in 2015 and take effect
five years later.
- Climate financing is a side
issue but a controversial one
that often deepens the rich-poor
divide that has hampered the
U.N. climate talks since their
launch in 1992. Critics of the U.N.
process see the climate nego-
tiations asa cover for attempts to
redistribute wealth.
Runge-Metzger said the EU
is prepared to continue support-
ing poorer nations in converting
to cleaner energy sources and in
adapting to a shifting climate,
despite the debt crisis roiling
Europe. But he couldn't prom-
ise that the EU would present
any new pledges in Doha and
said developing countries must
present detailed "bankable pro-
grams" before they can expect
any money.
Sometimes, developing coun-
tries seem to be saying, "OK give
us a blank check," he told AP.
Climate aid activists bristled
at that statement, saying many
developing countries have
already indicated what type of
programs and projects need

Too big to succeed
Big Ten is only benefitting financial interests
During a week that usually evokes bitter hatred between Ohio
and Michigan, many Big Ten students were found united in
their distaste for the announcement that two new universi-
ties will be joining the Big Ten Conference. On Nov.19 and 20, the Uni-
versity of Maryland and Rutgers University, respectively, announced
they would be joining the Big Ten, an expansion that will undoubtedly
shake up one of the nation's most respected and traditional sports con-
ferences. This move was inspired by purely financial interests and will
serve little benefit to either University students or student athletes.

What better time than now?

They say you don't really
understand a catastrophe
until it strikes you person-
ally. They say
that watching
the wreckage of
a natural disas-
ter on a televi-
sion screen just
isn't the same
as knowing the
people, the places
or the things that PATRICK
were destroyed MAILLET
by a storm. I
never thought
that I would have to learn what this
advice actually meant, thinking that
somehow my home in New Jersey
would always be exempt from this
rule of thumb. I was wrong.
Luckily, my family and our home
avoided the path of Hurricane
Sandy. Aside from heavy rain and
extended power outages, my family
was extremely lucky. Unfortunately,
I can't say the same for many of my
friends, their homes or the majority
of New Jersey and New York.
In the span of a few days, plac-
es that I've known my entire life
were wiped away. From Jenkin-
son's Boardwalk to friends' beach
houses, places that I've gone to my
entire life vanished into the sea.
One of my best friends, Grace, had
a small two-bedroom beach house
on Long Beach Island. My friends
and I always would go there in the-
summer, where her family would
host us. Some of my most cherished
moments from high school occurred
at Grace's beach house.
When I called Grace right after
Sandy hit, she told me that her par-
ents had to take a boat to where their
house used to be, and when they
arrived at the house, three of the four
walls had collapsed, and the house
was filled with mud and broken
glass. They were considered one of
the lucky ones. Her neighbor wasn't

so fortunate - a pontoon boat that
escaped from a nearby dock ended up
on top of what used to be his house.
Almost every house on her block
will have to be demolished before
they can even begin to think about
rebuilding.
I always thought storms like
these were for the South and that
something like a hurricane, much
less a superstorm, could. never hit
the Northeast. Unfortunately, I'm
afraid that we're going to have to
get used to it.
After Sandy ravaged New York
City, reports began to come out that
New York's Mayor Bloomberg and
Governor Cuomo were discussing
the possible construction of a levee
system around Manhattan. This
system would be similar to the one
surrounding New Orleans. When I
heard this news, I couldn't help but
feel astounded that the Northeast
would now have to get used to hur-
ricanes and other natural disasters.
How could this happen? How have
our weather patterns changed, like
this? As Governor Cuomo put it, it
seems like "we have a100-year flood
every two years now."
Experts have long stated that no
one storm can be directly due to
climate change. However, carbon
emissions can strongly affect the
likelihood of storms and their rela-
tive strength. As water tempera-
tures continue to rise, hurricanes
may occur more often and with
growing force.
Even if you disagree with climate
change, you cannot possibly deny the
fact that weather in recent years has
become ever more extreme. As The
New York Times reported, "three of
the 10 worst floods in Lower Man-
hattan's history since 1906 have
happened in the last three years."
According to the National Climate
Data Center, "of the 10 warmestsum-
mers in U.S. history, seven of them
have been since 2000."

Although the data is there, the
scientific world stands behind it and
the firsthand evidence is undeniable,
countless people still deny that cli-
mate change is happening and that
our planet is getting warmer. I love
when conservatives rant about their
duty to protect their children's and
grandchildren's futures by focusing
on slashing America's debt. These
same "future-defenders" are the
ones who deny climate change, spit
in the face of science and hamper any
realistic options that America can
take to reduce its carbon emissions.
Defending the
future means
combating
climate change.
Our debt is undeniably a massive
threat to the future of this country
but it must be dealt with gradually,
through bipartisan efforts. However,
if you're going to grab the micro-
phone and rant about how you and
your political colleagues are fighting
to defend future generations, then
use that same principle when con-
fronted with the future of our planet.
The damage done by Sandy has
resulted in more than $100 billion
in property damage, more than 100
casualties and immeasurable emo-
tional damage. We have the ability
and the obligation to work togeth-
er as a country to counter climate
change. We have to wake up from
this disaster once and for all and fight
to make sure it doesn't happen again. .
We need to act now.

Bring insiders to justice

As part of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission's
investigation into what
may become the
largest insider-
trading scheme
ever, University
neurology Prof.
Sidney Gilman1
signed a non-
prosecution
agreement on
Wednesday after TIMOTHY
being sued by BURROUGHS
federal authori-
ties. The agree-
ment eliminates the possibility of
any criminal charges being filed
against Gilman and requires him to
pay $234,000 in damages.
Gilman appears to be another
stepping stone in a much larger
investigation of Matthew Martoma,
a portfolio manager at CR Intrinsic
Investors, a hedge fund management
firm based in Connecticut. The SEC
has already gone after Martoma,
but their main target appears to be
Wall Street mogul Steve Cohen, the
founder and owner of SAC Capital
Advisors, the parentcompany of CR
Intrinsic Investors.
Gilman was accused of leaking
information regarding trials for an
Alzheimer drug. With this non-pub-
lic information, Martoma allegedly
withdrew his company's $700-mil-
lion investment in two pharmaceuti-
cal companies. Martoma's company
then went on to place a significant
short gale against the two compa-
nies. This resulted in $83 million in
profits for SAC and the avoidance of a
$194-million loss. SAC retained Gil-
man as a consultant for $108,000.
The University has released a
statement claiming it is taking "this
situation very seriously and is care-
fully reviewing all of Dr. Gilman's
activities while a faculty member at
our University." The statement adds
Big Ten shouldn't sell
off is integrity
TO THE DAILY:
For me, the participation of
schools exclusively from the Mid-
west was what made the Big Ten
charming and appealing. I could
live with our struggles in national
championships and bowl games
because the Big Ten comprised my
entire football world. I felt all warm
inside when Wisconsin played

that the University will follow the.
guidelines in place regarding con-
sulting work and clinical trials.
Gilman's future at the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System is
still unclear. Though he seems to
have escaped the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission with-
out any criminal charges, the Uni-
versity would still be able to take
disciplinary action. Gilman's law-
yer attests to his client's continued
cooperation with authorities in a
statement Wednesday. An article
in The New York Times explains
how Gilman's testimony could be
critical in the SEC's case against
Martoma. This additional testi-
mony could force Martoma to sign
an agreement with prosecutors
and testify against Cohen.
As one of the top institutes for
higher education, the University
must hold its faculty to the highest
level of academic integrity, which
Gilman's actions clearly violated.
As one of the University's highest-
paid professors, Gilman should
be a role model for his students
and other members of faculty. The
University must understand the
importance of the precedent their
reaction to these allegations will
set for the entire school.
It's still too early to predict
what type of punishment the Uni-
versity should implement against
Gilman. As its statement suggests,
the judicial process will result in
further information being released,
and based upon that knowledge,
the University can act. Some have
speculated that Gilman passed on
the results of the clinical trials not
knowing thatthey would be used as
insider information by Martoma.
Furthermore, there are examples
of traders taking advantage of med-
ical professionals who sometimes
lack complete understanding of
SEC rules and regulations. They try

to gain some bit of non-public infor-
mation, which to a medical profes-
sional might be inconsequential
and harmless, but in the hands of
a trader could be extremely impor-
tant. If this is the case, Gilman has
been presented with an opportu-
nity to redeem himself by helping
the authorities crack down on Mar-
toma. This would give a University
faculty member the opportunity to
admit he made a mistake and con-
currently show his true character
by testifying and bringing these
individuals to justice.
The 'U' should
hold its faculty
to the highest
standards.
However, if it's discovered that
Gilman acted knowingly out of
personal interest, he should no lon-
ger have any connection with the
University. If this is the case, he
contributed to the greedy, manipu-
lative culture that caused our econ-
omy's recent struggles. That type of
person has no place at our beloved
University or its hospital.
Once additional details sur-
rounding Gilman's motives come
forward, I can only hope that Uni-
versity will act with fairness. I
want to believe that Gilman acted
unknowingly and has found him-
self caught up in an extremely
unfortunate situation. If, so, he
should act like a true Wolverine and
demonstrate his sound character by
assisting the SEC in their pursuit of
the real criminals in this case.

Iowa, or Purdue played Illinois.
Even being a Michigan graduate,
I'd follow all the Big Ten games in
the paper and watch them when
available on television. Midwestern
imagery came to my mind. I cared
about the conference rivalries and
the Big Ten championship. I didn't
welcome the addition of Penn State,
but I lived with it since Pennsyl-'
vania borders Ohio and Lake Erie,
and since the state's Western side is
Midwest-like, culturally. And it was
only one outsider anyway.

But now, Big Ten commissioner
Jim Delaney is inviting New York
City and Washington D.C. onto
the farm. This, along with Dave
Brandon's references to the Mich-
igan "brand," is just too much for
me. I hope that advertisements

but I can't say I'd be shocked by
anything in a world where money

- voted to
decriminalize marijuana in
various capacities.
In the city of Ann Arbor, pos-
session of marijuana is decrimi-
nalized and punishable with a
$25 fine, with no jail or proba-
tion. However, University Police
enforce state law on campus
property. State law regards pos-
session of marijuana as a misde-
meanor, punishable by one year
in jail and up to $2,00 in fines.
Most recently, the Commit-
tee for a Safer Michigan, a group
pushing for legalization, started a
petition to put a proposal on the
2012 state ballot to legalize mari-
juana. Though the group collect-
ed 50,000 signatures, it fell short
of the about 323,000 required for
a ballot proposal.
Thomas Levine, an attorney
with Cannabis Council and direc-
tor of the committee, said the
main reason the campaign failed
was due to a lack of funds, as
opposed to lack of interest.
"I don't-think it was a sign that
people were not ready for this -
it was just a matter of being able
to pay petitioners so we're going
to be revisiting this in 2016 and
we're going to be raising money
between now and then," Levine
said.
However, Michael Traugott,
a political science and commu-
nications professor, pointed out
that the unwillingness of voters
to amend the state's constitution
in other policy areas in the recent
election, in which all six ballot
proposals were defeated, may
show that voters have trepidation
with altering the document.
"I don't think that given the
outcome of the 2012 election,
that many people are going to be
willing to amend the state consti-
tution to allow the sale of mari-
juana," Traugott said.
While some college students
have expressed excitement about
the possible legalization of the
popular drug, Traugott said
Michiganders shouldn't expect to
see much progress on the drug's
legalization anytime soon.
"I think the progress on this
is going to be very slow given
that the federal government still
objects to legalizing marijuana
for general consumption," Trau-
gott said.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) also presumed that a more
likely path for marijuana legal-
ization is through citizen peti-
tion and local initiatives, though
he noted it's an issue he would be
willing to discuss within the state
Legislature.

"I'm certainly willing to talk
about improving our marijuana
laws ... and willing to bring those
ideas to (the) Legislature," Irwin
said. "But do I think there's going
to be a majority of legislatures
who are going to support that
move in the short term? Probably
not ... I think by and large politi-
cians ... don't want to take on con-
troversial issues."
Irwin said he supports legal-
ization because he feels it could
lead to a long-term reduction in
drug usage as a result of proper
regulation and education on the
drug, alluding to the success in
reduction of smoking in America.
"If you look at cigarettes over
the last 30 to 50 years, you now
see cigarette use has declined
pretty precipitously because of a
concerted information campaign
to communicate with people
what the dangers are of tobacco
use," he said. "Look at how much
more successful that strategy has
been in terms of reducingtobacco
use than for instance the drug
war has been in reducing mari-
juana use."
On the federal level, President
Barack Obama has previously
stated that he has no intention of
legalizing the drug. The White
House's Office of National Drug
Control Policy maintains that
use of pot is harmful, and that its
legalization would increase use,
encumber the criminal justice
system and fail to increase tax
revenue because of higher social
costs.
At the heart of some state
struggles to legalize marijuana is
the constitutional dilemma that
would put state law at odds with
federal law, making the status
of the popular street drug fairly
murky. Experts say that until the
federal government takes on the
controversial issue, states and
municipalities will face difficul-
ties in enforcement.
The confusion is rooted in the
2005 U.S. Supreme Court deci-
sion in Gonzales v. Raich that
ruled that, by the power of the
commerce clause of the U.S. Con-
stitution, federal officials have
the power to enforce federal mar-
ijuana laws even if it is considered
legal locally.
Public Policy lecturer Craig
Ruff said the decision in Gonzales
v. Raich has created a headache
for prosecutors and law enforce-
ment officials as they try to rec-
oncile the chnging local policies
with the federal interventions.
"A local policeman in Seattle
could avert his or her eyes from
seeing someone smoke mari-
juana on the street, (but) on the
other hand there could be a Drug
Enforcement Agency official
standing right next to the city cop
and the DEA official says 'Oh I'm
in possession charge - and the
University's sexual misconduct
policy. A draft of revised protocols
was released in October, and fol-
lows requirements established by
the U.S. Department of Education
requiring that colleges instigate

investigations of reported acts
of sexual misconduct, as well as
lower their burden of proof.
The platforms of LSA-SG can-
didates indicate that some of the
issues important to future repre-
sentatives include increasing the
quota of printing pages for LSA
students and making more classes
from other University colleges
available to LSA students.
The election ballot also asks
three questions of voters, which
include whether or not ROTC stu-
dents should be allowed to regis-
ter early, whether the LSA Course
Guide should allow students to
search for classes scheduled dur-
ing a particular time slot. It'll also
ask students ifthey'reaware of the
state of Michigan's adaptation of
the Medical Amnesty Act.
Burns said LSA-SG will use
the responses of students to fuel
future project development.

lawyer, Marc Mukasey, acknowl-
edged that he will be cooperating

doing to arrest him,"' Ruff said.
This ability of the federal gov-
ernment to intervene also applies
to the Michigan Marijuana Act
of 2008, which allows use of the
drug for medicinal purposes.
Ruff said even with this limited
law, state and local officials have
found that enforcement and regu-
lation is challenging.
Opinions on marijuana reform
are somewhat divided along par-
tisan lines, with 53 percent of
Democrats, 30 percent of Repub-
licans and 49 percent of Inde-
pendents supporting the drug's
legalization, accordingto the Pew
Research Center
"There is a partisan divide ...
but it's also a cultural divide,"
Ruff said. "People who are very
religious, many of whom live in
rural areas ... are very concerned
that marijuana could lead to poor
health behavior and could lead to
a person being tempted by other
harder drugs."
Ruff noted there is also divide
in support among demograph-
ics and geographic areas. Ruff
explained that urban areas are
generally more favorable to the
legalization, partly due to greater
exposure to the drug.
"The fact that crime is higher
in cities makes a lot of urban resi-
dents say 'Why are we wasting
precious law enforcement dollars
chasing after people who are, you
know, smoking one cigarette a
day of marijuana when in fact we
have rapists and murderers and
robbers on our streets?"'he said.
Yashinsky said opinions inAnn
Arbor, East Lansing and other
college towns with a high popula-
tion of youth voters are not rep-
resentative of the views in other
parts of the state, adding that in
neighboring Oakland County,
elected officials are resisting the
Medical MarijuanaAct of 2008.
"You'd be surprised if you
never made it out here (to Oak-
land County) and spent your
time in Lansing or Ann Arbor or
Ypsilanti or Grand Rapids even
where you're used to seeing some
dispensaries there's nothing like
that here ... I think that's indica-
tive of the social aspect." Yashin-
sky said.
Ruff also pointed to a clear
age gap, with the majority of the
younger generations supporting
legalization and retirees gener-
ally opposing it.
Yashinsy said the dispropor-
tionate influence older residents
have on politicians given their
heightened tendency to donate
to campaigns contributes to the
resistance some politicians have
taken to the issue.
"People who get the ear of their
congressman are by and large the
people that are over 65," Yashin-
sky said.
"A lot of times administrators
don't respond to student initia-
tives alone, and they want to see
the data behind it," Burns said.
"We hope to get a lot of student
response."

LSA sophomore Kendall John-
son, the candidate running for
re-election, came up with the idea
last year to hold student debates
for prospective candidates. She
said despite low attendance, this
year's debate was "a great oppor-
tunity for constituents to let
students know what they are pas-
sionate about and what they are
running for."
Johnson also emphasized the
importance of increasing student
involvement during elections,
including getting students to LSA-
SG events in order to increase
voter turnout.
"I just hope that we can con-
tinue to be all that we can be and
continue to represent the students
and make changes to them that
are beneficial," Johnson said. "I
hope that (LSA) SG continues to
keep its name out there to make
collaborations and grow as an
organization.",

came against teams who posted
a combined 40-56 record. The
Wolverines were favored in all
of their victories, they were the
underdog in every loss.
So, simply put, Michigan
performed to expectations.
But that doesn't leave anyone
feeling better. Team 133 had
four chances to make a state-
ment. They couldn't make a
single one; they couldn't beat
any team worth its salt, save
the miracle victory over North-
western.
Things could have gone much
differently. Two plays either way
could have seen Michigan finish
at 10-2 or 6-6. Last-second vic-
tories over Michigan State and
Northwestern could just as easily
have been losses.
And then there were inju-
ries. Standout cornerback Blake
Countess was knocked out of the
season opener with a knee injury
and never returned. Redshirt
junior tailback Fitzgerald Tous-
saint missed the last game of the
season after injuring his left leg
against Iowa. Senior quarterback
Denard Robinson sustained
an ulnar-nerve injury against
Nebraska and never threw
another pass. He scampered for a

bylaws and CSG's governing
documents in its attempt to put
the question on the ballot, in
addition to other more general
violations.
The non-binding ballot ques-
tion asks if graduate students
would like RSG and other
graduate student organizations
to look into the possibility of
seceding from CSG. However,
if such a vote does occur, it's
unlikely the results will imme-
diately be made public.
CSG represents every stu-
dent on campus, and individual
schools and colleges have their
own student governments. In
September, RSG voted to cre-
ate an exploratory committee to
investigate student interest in
graduate student secession from
CSG.
At the time, RSG president
Michael Benson said an all-
graduate student government,
which would split the represen-
tation of more than 40,000 stu-
dents on campus into two major
student governments, could also
resultinthe splitting of the $7.19
student fee that students pays
each semester. Secession could
result in CSG losing hundreds of
thousands of dollars it typically
receives annually.
CSG alleges in its suit that
RSG - which submitted the
question on Nov. 15, 12 days
before the start of the election
- did not follow its own rules
or CSG's rules for when a ballot
question needs to be submitted
for inclusion on the ballot.
According to the CSG Com-
piled Code segments cited in
the suit, ballot questions must
be submitted 25 days prior to
the election and the RSG bylaws
cited in the suit state that ballot

questions must be sent 14 days
prior to an election.
"Twelve days is simply not
enough time for adequate cam-
paigning to take place," the
suit states. "Furthermore, this
smoke and mirrors approach by
the RSG board to place the lan-
guage on the ballot on its first
read, while violating the dead-
lines, almost amounts to elec-
tion fraud."
CSJ chief justice Ryan Ger-
sovitz, a University Law School
student, said in an interview
Saturday that discussion of the
injunction is speculative at this
point, but if CSJ isn't able to ren-
der a decision by the time the
election commences, the results
of the poll could be withheld
pending CSJ's decision.
"We'll probably talk with the
parties and figure out the best
thing to do," Gersovitz said. "I

on Saturday, his first touchdown
in 355 minutes of game time - to
recap, Robinson, whose 91 touch-
downs are a Michigan record,
wentjust eight minutes short of
not scoring for half a season.
But maybe performingto
expectations wasn't so bad.
What if Michigan just isn't built
yet to compete with the nation's
elite? Perhaps the Wolverines,
by coming within a touchdown
of beating teams like Ohio State
and Notre Dame - and even
Nebraska, with a healthy Robin-
son - were outperformingtheir
talent level.
Now, no one inside Schem-
bechler Hall will agree with that.
But look at this. Alabama's
offensive line and entire defen-
sive corps is NFL-bound. Notre
Dame has future top-20 draft
picks like Heisman Trophy-
candidate Manti Te'o. Ohio ~
State, Nebraska? They're simply
more talented from top to bot-
tom, though there certainly are
outliers.
Who from Michigan's senior
class will hear his name called
in the NFLdraft? Robinson,
surely, though who knows when
or at what position. Jordan
Kovacs? Will Campbell? Roy
Roundtree? Kenny Demens?
There are plenty of guys who
might well geta tryout with an
NFL team next summer, but the
only surefire draft pick in this
can only speculate, but maybe
that would just mean that
instead of enjoining (the ques-
tion) being on the ballot, we
would enjoin the release of the
results until after so thatrway we
could have the hearing on Tues-
day or Wednesday for instance,
which would give Rackham a
little more time to prepare."
Gersovitz said withhold-
ing the results of a vote would
ensure that if CSJ sides with
RSG, midterm ballot results
would still include responses
to the ballot question, rather
than removing the question
entirely and delaying a vote
until next semester. He added
that if CSJ sided with CSG, it
would most likely state that the
question wasn't "properly" put
on the ballot, and RSG would
likely alter the question for next
semester's ballot.
Still, Gersovitz stressed that
this case has no bearing on
whether or not graduate stu-
dents will able to secede.
"None of these claims are say-
ing that Rackham can't secede,"
Gersovitz said.
CSJ is only scheduled to
have a closed-door meeting on
Monday, but Gersovitz said the
group isn't planning on schedul-
ing the hearings at that time.
"Part of it will be (dependent
on) how prepared the Rackham
Student Government is," Gerso-
vitz said. "If the Rackham Stu-
dent Government is ready and
prepared to go ASAP, then CSJ
will as well, but we haven't got-
ten a chance to get in touch with
them."
On Saturday night, Benson
declined to comment on wheth-
er or not RSG would able to
respond to the suit by Monday,
noting he still has to contact
other members of the RSG exec-
utive board.
At its Nov. 15 meeting, RSG

unanimously approved the
inclusion of the secession ques-
tion on the ballot. RSG also held
a vote to endorse voting "yes"
on the question, and the resolu-
tion to endorse the question was
voted down.
"That was defeated, with the
argument being as the sponsors
of the election we wantto keepa
neutral approach to the student
body as an organization and let
the students make up their own
minds," Benson said. "The ques-
tion itself, the ballot question,
was approved unanimously."
Benson said as of Saturday
nightthat he hasn't yet received
any communication from CSG
or CSJ other than an e-mail
regarding the injunction to CSJ.
"We're the respondents in
this so I think we'll certainly
hear from CSJ (Sunday) or Mon-
day, but I haven't received an

senior class is a quarterback
who certainly won't play quar-
terback at the next level.
That's not to take anything
away from the talent on Michi-
gan's roster, it's to emphasize
the caliber of opponents the
Wolverines battled against -
and lost to.
In two years, the talent level
on the Wolverinesideline will
be different, vastly different.
Though Michigan coach Brady
Hoke's metric for success - a
Big Ten championship - won't
necessarily change, perform-
ing to expectations will look
different. Then we'll be able to
adequately judge the Michigan
coaching staff for how it has
shaped the team. If Michigan
lost these same four games two
years from now, then there
would be reason to panic. Not
now. Not yet.
Is 8-4 a disappointing
record? Sure it is. It always will
be at Michigan. But each loss
was a legitimate loss. Michigan
didn't give away any game, per
se, it just didn't steal any ban-
ner matchups either.
They had every opportunity
to beat the best, but they're not
quite there.
Not yet.

e-mail from them," he said.
Though CSG filed the injunc-
tion six days before the election,
Law School student Jeremy
Keeney, chair of the CSG rules
committee, said the filing was
not done out of malice.
"We could've waited until
Sunday, but we did have every-
thing ready to go by Wednesday
and we wanted to make sure
that both the Rackham Student
Government and the CSJ had
enough time to thoroughly read
through all of the complaints
and respond to them so that
RSG has a fair shot at this," Kee-
ney said.
He added: "We're not trying
to do anything under the cover
of darkness. We want to make
sure everyone's on the same
page here and hoving forward."
Gersovitz said this hearing
would be different from the
court proceedings that lasted
for 12 hours, severely delaying
the election last March.
Though RSG sent the ques-
tion 12 days before the start
of the election, the election is
described as taking place on
Nov. 27 through 29 in the suit,
meaning that RSG sent the
question 14 days before the
end of the election. The lan-
guage in RSG's bylaws cited by
the suit does not make clear at
what point in the election bal-
lot questions need to be submit-
ted 14 days before. While RSG
would still be in violation of the
CSG Compiled Code, the suit
does concede that "CSG has
plenary authority to regulate
the petition deadline."
The suit also alleges other
violations unrelated to the ques-
tion's filing date. It argues that
RSG has parts of it bylaws at
odds with the governing docu-
ments of CSG and that consis-
tently vacant seats in the CSG
assembly set aside for Rackham

students is a violation of the
University of Michigan Student
Body Constitution.
LSA junior Lukas Garske -
who had been working on the
issue with members of the CSG
executive board, including Law
School student Jeremy Kee-
ney, Business junior Michael
Proppe, the assembly chair, and
Rackham representative Patrick
O'Mahen - said the injunction
was a response to these viola-
tions, not to RSG's intentions.
"We're not trying to dis-
qualify them on any technicali-
ties here," Garske said. "There's
multiple violations - they've
modified their constitution in
an attempt to gain supremacy
over the all-campus constitu-
tion; they've failed.to collabo-
rate with CSG by failing to fill
the Rackham seats on Central
Student Government."

tive revelations.
"Life of Pi" falls into the latter,
as eye-candy CGI and evocative
narrations paint a stunning pic-
ture. Alas, like with any rib-eye,
one must circumvent the fat.
Returning from a three-year
hiatus, director Ang Lee ("Broke-

back Mountain") delivers an ace
direction of "A story to make
you believe in God." It's a taste-
fully honest adaptation to Yann
Martel's accolade-heavy novel of
the same name, which President
Barack Obama openly tagged as
"an elegant proof of God, and
the power of storytelling." Par-
ents of defiant, atheistic teenag-
ers should not expect spiritual
conversion, because "Pi" tackles
religion on the tangent rather
than in-depth. Undying and
unrelenting hope, however, is at
the forefront.
Pi (played with resolve by
newcomer Suraj Sharma) is a
gentle, intellectual 16-year-old
Indian boy whose name tells a
story on its own. His entrepre-
neurial family architects a zoo,
one teeming with zebras, spider
monkeys, hyenas and a Bengal
tiger named Richard Parker. Shit
nears the fan when they must sell
the zoo animals in Canada. They
hop aboard a freighter across the
deep blue sea, only to encounter

ferocious perfect-storm waves.
Everyone - persons and ani-
mals alike - perishes, except Pi
and a few zoo companions. Soon
after, only Pi and Richard Parker
remain on a lifeboat with their
wits, hunger, agony and spirits to
keep them afloat.
To most, a story to make you
believe in God is a tall order for
any believer or non-believer. Lee,
staying true to his source novel,
approaches this with man's most
thought-provoking fear: death. In
an early scene, Pi's father forces
his son to watch Richard Parker
devour a goat to demonstrate the
sheer soullessness of a beast. Pi
retorts, "animals do have souls."
This interspecific egalitarianism,
unique to Pi, serves as his saving
grace with Richard Parker. Death
recurs throughout the film to
reinforce Pi's pluck in the direst
of times.
Visually, "Pi" equates to a pic-
ture-perfect Thanksgiving feast.

ziness comes, ,
the only way to quell the chaos
is to recognize it. Rather than
sweep family feuding under the
rug or paint an idyllic portrait of
June Cleaver & Co., "Silver Lin-
ings Playbook" tells the truth
about what goes on beyond the
domestic threshold - and more
often than not, it's a far cry from
"Home Sweet Home."
After Pat (Bradley Cooper,
"Hit & Run") finds his wife Nikki
(Brea Bee, "The Destruction
Room") cheating, he beats the
guy to a bloody pulp and earns
himself an eight-month stay at
a mental institution. When he's
released and smacked with a
hefty restraining order, Pat must
live with his eccentric parents

From Page 6A

a quasi-godly set of eyes. Effec-
tively illustrating the ocean as a
calm sheet of reflecting glass, a
story of suffering finds refresh-
ing solace. A patient, breath-
ing lens isn't afraid to follow Pi
underwater for several seconds
or even bob above the surface
of the ocean like a Coast Guard
buoy.
Imagine the never-ending
rainbow of colors in "Finding

while he desperately tries to
reconcile his marriage - but he
must first show Nikki that he's a
changed man, fitter in mind and
body. When Pat meets Tiffany
(Jennifer Lawrence, "House at
the End of the Street"), a trou-
bled young woman with similar
struggles, they form a quirky,
combative friendship, one that
eventually turns symbiotic: Pat
agrees to accompany Tiffany to
her ballroom dancing competi-
tion if she will sneakily pass on a
letter from him to Nikki.
The storyline is fairly simple,
straightforward and even a bit
slow at times, but the cast of
characters couldn't be more com-
plicated, conflicted and captivat-
ing, setting this film apart from
typical dramedies.
Cooper tactfully vacillates
between dejection and motiva-
tion, obstinacy and willingness,
and selfishness and generos-
ity. He realistically portrays the
impacts of bipolar disorder, pro-
viding some hilarious moments:
He chucks a Hemingway novel
out of a window when he dis-
agrees with the ending, wakes up
the whole neighborhood scream-
ing as he searches for his wedding
video and destroys a magazine
rack in a fit of rage when he hears
his wedding song at his psychia-
trist's office. He's manic and he's
depressed. He says "more inap-
propriate things than appropri-
ate things," and he's surprisingly
charming when he does. Cooper
is a walking contradiction, and
it's a winning combination.

Giving an equally humanized
performance, Lawrence shows
a spunky, fearless attitude and a
fiery sense of humor. She takes
a character grieving the recent
death of her husband and emotes
confidence, sureness and vicious
rhetoric - "Girl Power" at its
best. She's a worthy adversary
for Cooper's loud, obnoxious
demeanor, and the best moments
arrive when their two person-
alities clash: Tiffany follows Pat
when he goes jogging - to his
extreme dismay - and she jok-
ingly accuses him of assault in
front of a movie theater, warrant-
ing a visit from a police officer.
Robert De Niro ("Freelanc-
ers") adds comedic value as Pat's
father, the most belligerent Phila-
delphia Eagles fan on the planet,
Jacki Weaver ("The Five Year
Engagement") attempts and fails
to mitigate peace in the home as
Pat's conservative mother and
Chris Tucker ("Rush Hour 3")
gets some laughs as Pat's friend, a
repeatescapee fromthe loony bin.
But shining through the den-
sity of talented performances is
the highly entertaining and pal-
pable chemistry between Cooper'
and Lawrence. It's the raw, senti-
mental backbone of the narrative.
Their relationship is a touching
human connection that elicits
hope. It teaches that sometimes
it takes two people to accomplish
what each cannot do alone, and
that even the most unlikely can-
didate, by outward appearance
or initial impression, could be a
silver lining.

because he or she is living under

been another stupid remake, a

who call themselves the Wol-

That pretty much lays out
the lean meat of the rib-eye. So,
about that fat? Many early char-
acters play trivial filler roles, to
no avail. They don't propel the
plot, add flavor or cause tangi-
ble discord. They suck. In addi-
tion, Pi's religious devotions are
barely scraped, whereas deeper
probing could've justified the
later thematic elements.
The fact is, we're still eating a
first-rate steak, not a half-chuck,
half-mole rat hamburger. "Pi"
succeeds as a delightful, appe-
tizing treat, but not as a full-
fledged character study. Good
thing it's not trying to be one.

Heavyweight actors

DailyArts Writer
Never underestimate a grown
man's capacity to throw a hissy
fit. And as writer-director Yaron
Zilberman
("Watermarks")
proves in "A
Late Quartet," A Late
it doesn't mat- Quartet
ter if this man
is the most Atthe
brilliant being Michigan
to ever walk
the planet ... or EntertainmentOne
Justin Bieber.
When the chips are down and
those nasty, nasty insults are
being thrown around, anyone can
flip their shit.
In this case, "anyone" is an elite
quartet of classical musicians
entering what will be their 25th
season-together.
The leader of the group is Peter
Mitchell (Christopher Walken,
"Seven Psychopaths"), a wise and
dedicated cellist quietly griev-
ing the loss of his wife. Next to
Peter sits second violinist Robert
Gelbart (Philip Seymour Hoff-
man, "The Master"). Robert is
the emotional center of the quar-
tet, bringing with him a colorful
passion that adds cohesion to the
concerts.
Robert's wife, Juliette (Cath-
erine Keener, "Being John Mal-
kovich") plays viola and is the
oft-weepy conscience of the
group, her lip quivering at the

slightest sign of confrontation.
The most intriguing character in
the film is Daniel Lerner (Mark
Ivanir, "The Adventures of Tin-
tin"), first violinist for the quartet
and a man completely obsessed
with the idea of achieving techni-
cal perfection in music.
The film starts off as an exami-
nation of the complex dynamics
holding the musicians together,
with Zilberman taking time to
highlight how these codependent
relationships mirror Beethoven's
"Opus 131," the classic piece to
be played at the season's first
concert. It's a belabored start to
a rather forcefully strung movie,
but sets the stage well for the
moment everything devolves into
chaos.
This moment is one of those
"Oh-no-she-didn't" instances
that pops up after Peter mourn-
fully announces he is experienc-
ing early signs of Parkinson's and
wishes to retire after his next
performance. After the obligatory'
displays of grief, Robert quickly
seizes the opportunity to high-
light resentments he has been
harboring about exclusively play-
ing second violin - a role some
consider less important than the
first violinist's. Ultimately, it all
boils down to Robert angrily ask-
ing Juliette whether or not she
believes he's truly a better violin-
ist than Daniel.
The response shocks Robert to
his very core, setting in motion
a series of events involving the
most infantile cases of sexual
deceit and butt-hurtedness seen
all year. But surprisingly, in an
almost Jerry Springer-esque
sense, the movie is more enter-
taining because of it. Of course,

it doesn't hurt that all four of
the actors involved deliver some
of the most memorable perfor-
mances of the year.
Every time Seymour Hoff-
man hurtles shrill insults across
the room, it's guaranteed that
everyone in the audience will feel
the tendrils of outrage sprout-
ing out of his eyes. On the same
token, Walken brings the sense
of relevant humanity we've come
to expect from him. His scenes
are sad and, at times, difficult to
watch for two reasons. The first is.
the situation in which his charac-
ter finds himself - grieving wid-
ower beginning to lose his music,
the only thing he really cares
about anymore. The second rea-
son is the efficacy of Christopher
Walken.
The brilliance of the per-
formance becomes clear when
Walken capitalizes on the cruel
banality of Peter's plight to forge
a connection between mental and
physical decline. The associa-
tion is harrowingly visible in the
slightest quiver of Walken's hands
as he lays eyes on his cello - once
an object he knew so intimately, it
has cruelly turned into a constant
reminder of inadequacy.
In addition to the acting, what
elevates this film is its dedicated
respect for Beethoven's music,
emphatically echoed in every plot
development on screen. Some-
how, the dignified intricacy of
every composition becomes more
than just something nice to hear.
Somehow, the celebrated melo-
dies put us in the shoes of our
beleaguered quartet. And what do
we learn? Those cultured intellec-
tuals in Carnegie Hall watch soap
operas, too.

This is proven

which tries to take a fresh look
at Christmas, Easter, the Tooth
Fairy and'even formerly insignifi-

the traditions we love.
Chris Pine ("Star Trek") is the
roguish and isolated Jack Frost,
who combats his loneliness by
bringing joy to children via snow
days. Jack is wildly unhappy
because he doesn't feel appreciat-
ed by the other magical creatures
- the question of what he actu-
ally does is left for the audience
to guess at. He is promoted by the
mysterious Man inthe Moon, an
unexplained presence, tojoin the
Guardians, a select group of holi-
day favorites who vow to protect
the children of the world.
The Guardians are composed
of a Russian, tattooed Santa (a
barely recognizable Alec Bald-.

six-foot-tall Easter Bunny (Hugh
Jackman, "Real Steel"), an under-

Saturday, a faint snow fell from read zeroes, fueled by the kind

of euphoria that can only result
from a win in this game.
The Buckeyes pulled ahead
in the third quarter and stayed
ahead, kneeling away a hard-
fought, 26-21 victory, with Michi-
gan (6-2 Big Ten, 8-4 overall)
powerless to do anything about it.
"It hurt," said fifth-year senior
wide receiver Roy Roundtree.
"We have to look at film and look
at the mistakes that we made."
The early action on Saturday
seemed to promisea high-scoring

affair, which has been something
of an aberration over the history
of this rivalry.
Ohio State (8-0, 12-0) needed
just six plays to score the game's
first touchdown, a four-yard run
by bruising running back Carlos
Hyde after a rapid drive down
the field. But the Wolverines
answered on their second pos-
session when junior quarterback
Devin Gardner found Roundtree
for a 75-yard= catch-and-run and

ines hope
of advancing before having the
win snatched from their grasp
via an overtime goal.

In the first period of that con-
test, the Wolverines controlled
most of the opening period, scor-
ing a goal in the game's first two
minutes and having one waved
off shortly after.
Saturday night, however, a 5-1
Cornell victory in The Frozen
Apple at Madison Square Gar-
den, was a different story, but
the same result.
"It might be a better Cornell
team (compared to the NCAA
Tournament game)," said Michi-

gan coach Red Berenson. "But it
was a worse Michigan team."
The Big Red came out of the
gate buzzing, and Michigan took
four first-period penalties, while
Cornell was only penalized once.
The Wolverines had finally
garnered some momentum at
the 13:09 mark when Cornell's

box, but 30 seconds into the

COLUMBUS - It took Ohio
State coach Urban Meyer two
quarters, but he had simplified
Michigan's offense down to one
key: stop Denard Robinson.
Michigan's senior quarter-
back has been nursing a right-
elbow injury that limits his
ability to throw. But against the
Buckeyes on Saturday, Robin-
son broke free several times on
long runs in the first half. After
the last one, a 67-yard scamper,
Meyer sought out his defensive
coaches.
"My comment was, after Isaw

"That's the input I had. Prob-
ably the same - I think 107,000
people said that as well."

That simple key, and Ohio
State's execution, shut out Mich-
igan in the second half and gave
the Buckeyes the win; 26-21.

certainly won't play quarterback

That's not to take anything
away from the talent on Michi-

caliber of opponents the Wolver-

In two years, the talent level
on the Wolverine sideline will be
different, vastly different. Though

metric for success - a Big Ten

we'll be able to adequately judge

how it has shaped the team.
If Michigan lost these same
four games two years from now,
then there would be reason to
panic. Not now. Not yet.
Is 8-4 a disappointing record?
Sure it is. It always will be at
Michigan. But each loss was a

Sandwiched between Michi-
gan's football and hockey game on
Saturday, the Michigan women's
basketball team took on Boston
University (3-3) in its second
game of a back-to-back - it's only
one of the regular season.
"It's a
good expe- BOSTON 58
rience MICHIGAN 67
to have,"
senior forward Rachel Sheffer
said. "We know the other team
had to travel a lot more and we
had to capitalize on that."
After senior guard Kate
Thompson led the Wolverines
(5-1) to a tough victory over Har-
vard on Friday with a career-high
24 points - tying a school-record
with six 3-pointers - Sheffer took
over the scoring reins against
the Terriers, scoring 13 first-half
points and 18 total in the 67-58
victory.
With the teams trading baskets
for most of the first half, .Michi-
gan gradually started to take con-
trol of the game with an 8-0 run
to end the first stanza. Thompson
sparked the Wolverines' run by
scoring seven consecutive points,
including a jumper to tie the game
and a 3-pointer to give Michigan a
28-25 lead.
The Wolverines extended
their lead to six on a 3-point play
by senior forward Nya Jordan
right before halftime. Jordan
produced a solid game off the
bench, chipping in seven points,
four rebounds and a team-high
four assists. Boston kept the game
close by relying on the 3-pointer,
before goingscoreless for the final
3:27 of the first half. Out of its 29
first-half field goal attempts, 16
came from beyond the arc. Led
by senior guard Kristen Sims,
who made three of the team's six
3-pointers and finished with a
game-high 19 points, the Terriers
managed to hang around, despite

zero points in the paint during the
first 20 minutes of the game.
"In the first half, most of their
points were on threes," Sheffer
said in regard to how the team
adjusted at halftime. "So we talk-
ed about extending our zone."
Michigan, however, had a more
balanced approach in the first
stanza, shooting 10-23 from the
field, including 3-8 from 3-point
distance.
The second half seemed to
resemble the first as Boston and
Michigan remained six points
apart as a timeout was called five
minutes into the half.
After being limited to just two
points in the first half, senior
guard Jenny Ryan scored seven
of Michigan's first nine points to
start the half, including five in a
row to push its lead to eight. The
Terriers answered, going on an
11-2 run to take a 43-42 lead.
"That kind of got us off guard,"
said Sheffer. "But then we found
our rhythm."
The lead would not last long
as freshman Madison Ristovski
answered with a basket to regain
the lead and Ryan connected
from straightaway on a 3-pointer
to stretch the lead to four. Ryan
continued her hot shooting, mak-
ing her third 3-pointer of the half
to push the lead back to eight
with 6:37 remaining. Playing all
40 minutes, Ryan finished with
15 points to go along with eight
rebounds.
"I wasn't really trying to be
an offensive threat (in the first
half)," said Ryan. "So in the sec-
ond half to open up other scoring
options, I needed to really start
looking for my shot."
Sophomore guard Nicole Elm-
blad added the dagger with 2:36
remaining, hitting a midrange
jumper to give the Wolverines an
11 point lead - their biggest lead
before adding free throws in the
final minute. Elmblad would fin-
ish the game with a career-high,
and game-high nine rebounds.

and Michigan finished at 8-4.
recap, Robinson, whose 91 touch-
downs are a Michigan record,
went just eight minutes short of
not scoring for half a season.
But maybe performing to
expectations wasn't so bad.
What if Michigan just isn't built
yet to compete with the nation's
elite? Perhaps the Wolverines,
by coming within a touchdown
of beatingteams like Ohio State
and Notre Dame - and even
Nebraska, with a healthy Robin-
son - were outperforming their
talent level.

writhed on

The lyrics continued to pump.
From the mouth of the man who

"For real, it don't get no bigger,

That was Tim Hardaway Jr.'s

For a player who feeds on ener-
gy, Hardaway was in the right
place. It was the venue where his
father was booed, but he found
himself cheered by the throngs of
Michigan fans that overwhelmed
the Garden.
Friday wasn't a 3-point shoot-
ing night for Hardaway; but
something much more convinc-

the ball onto the floor and
sprinted to the basket. He soared
over defenders, always got where .
he wanted to go on the floor. He
glided past overmatched Kansas

Hardaway scored a game high

and pulled down seven rebounds,
a shoo-in as the tournament's top

He roared and barked after big
shots, doled out chest bumps and

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Junior guard Tim HardawayJr. was named the Most Outstanding Player.

Last year's iteration of Tim Hard-
away involved moping and bad
body language. Head shaking and
impulsive shooting.
Had he peaked as a freshman?
The lights may have been on
in the gym, but not upstairs. In
New York, both were on, brighter
than ever.
"I don't know if the pressure
or what happened last year," said
Kansas State coach Bruce Weber,
who was at Illinois last year. "But
he's a different player."
For Hardaway it's always
been about seizing control of his
life. First he had to emerge from
the overbearing influence of his
hyper-competitive father, a for-
mer NBA star. He had to figure
out how to play not to please
everyone else, but to please him-
self. Once considered to be an
NBA talent, Hardaway fell out of
favor after last season's struggles.
This year was about regaining
control of his basketball future.
He wasn't about to become a
mere complement to an offense
centered on the freshmen and
Burke. He regained control by his
own volition.
"The biggest thing is his work
ethic," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "That doesn't just
happen. He's got great DNA, but
DNA doesn't get you there alone.
The young man is in the gym all
the time." .

He continued to seize control
this weekend. Not about to put
the fate of his tournament, and
the team's, in the fickle nature of
the long jump shot, he attacked.
He pursued the rim relentlessly
and was never satisfied. With the
3-pointer, a too-strong flick of the
wrist could mean a miss off the
heel of the rim. When he takes it
to the basket, it's all in his con-
trol. Sheer will.
So, he made two of 10 3-point-
ers this week, no matter. He made
14 of 18 shots from within the arc.
He grabbed the reins and made
sure things worked out how he
wanted.
He scored 11 points down the
stretch on Wednesday as the
Wolverines came back to take
down Pittsburgh, 67-62, in the
semifinals and he remained
relentless in Michigan's 71-57
pounding of the Wildcats on
Friday.
Hardaway leaves The Empire
State and the self-proclaimed
World's Most Famous-Arena with
a few things. He has a trophy for
the tournament title, and another
for being the week's top player.
Also, most likely, a headache.
But more importantly, he also
leaves with control - over his
game, his team, and his future.

and fourth quarter, respectively.
(Gardner also lost a fumble in the
first half.)
But the real back-breaker was
Gardner's interception on what
turned out to be the team's final
drive of the game. The junior
often found receivers for long
completions down the field
on Saturday, but this was also
Gardner's most mistake-ridden
game when it came to taking
sacks and missing receivers. The
Wolverines' defense was solid
for most of the afternoon, often
put in tough spots in the second
half because of the offense's sud-
den ineptitude. Dynamic Buck-
eye quarterback Braxton Miller
found success through the air but
was contained on the ground.
Hyde, though, wasn't con-
tained. The running back
torched Michigan's defense for
146 yards and a touchdown on
26. carries, constantly cutting
through the middle of the front
seven. It was Hyde who clinched
the game for Ohio State, burst-
ing forward for a gain of 13 yards
on third-and-7 with just several
minutes remaining on the drive
after Gardner's interception.
"(Hyde) out-leveraged us a
couple times in there because of
what we wanted to do, which was
a little different," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke. "It worked in
the first half pretty well. Didn't
tackle very well, I didn't think,

from that standpoint. He's a
big back, and I didn't think we
wrapped him up on the first hit a
couple times like we needed to."
"He ran the ball hard," added
fifth-year senior safety Jordan
Kovacs. "We didn't get enough
hats to the ball."
The offense's woeful second
half could be blamed partially on
play calling. On the Wolverines'
first drive after halftime, Hoke
elected to go for it on fourth-and-
two from Michigan's 48-yard
line. The Wolverines then faced
third-and-short on each of their
next three drives. Offensive
coordinator Al Borges called a
running play each time, and each
time, Michigan failed to convert.
"You gotta look at where
you're at and what you feel you
may have an opportunity," Hoke
said of the three calls. "Upstairs
you see a lot of different things."
The Wolverines were in no
mood to second-guess or dwell
onmissedopportunities afterthe
game. Their faces were somber,
and they spoke with the low voic-
es one would expect after they let
a rival beat them and complete an
undefeated season in doing so.
Hoke talked briefly of the
future, of the freshmen and
other underclassmen that "will
remember" this loss and use it as
motivation.
But nothing could ease the
pain of Saturday.
"You don't want to come down
here and lose," a weary Kovacs
said. "That's about all I can say
about it."

From Page 1B
game against Pitt and a hard-
fought game today."
The game was broken wide
open after Michigan's six-
minute run in the first half,
and it was evident by the way
the Wolverines played. Michi-
gan cut down on its transition
game and started shooting
more outside shots, and fresh-
man forward Glenn Robin-
son III and Hardaway even
attempted dunks - something
that's only been done late in
Michigan's previous blowout
wins.
Hardaway, the tourna-
ment's Most Outstanding
Player, left the game early on
precautions for a concussion,
but was flanked by perfor-
mances from Robinson and
Burke. The Columbus, Ohio
native was silent for the first
half - he didn't attempt a shot
and had two turnovers - but
found the open lane and his
groove in the second half, put-
ting up 10 points, six rebounds
and four assists. Robinson was
close to his first career double-
double, as he contributed nine
points and 12 rebounds.
Freshmen Nik Stauskas and
Mitch McGary contributed
nicely off the bench with 10
and six points, respectively,
and with his career-high 12
boards, Robinson paced the
Wolverines to a 42-30 mar-
gin in rebounding. Michigan
coach John Beilein was pleased
with his team's rebounding
performance in the semifi-
nals against Pittsburgh and
was similarly happy with the
rebounding . efforts against
Kansas State.
"We haven't been able to
(rebound) in the past," Beilein
said. "We're doing it well now.
of blocking out and getting our
own offensive rebounds like
you saw today."
The first half wasn't so easy
for Michigan, though, as the
Wildcats were a force in the
paint. Despite shooting 29
percent, Kansas State kept it
close with 12 points on eight

offensive rebounds in the first
stanza. The Wildcats finished
with 12 offensive boards and
18 second-chance points, sig-
nificantly less than their 25
offensive rebounds per game
average.
"I thought rebounding was
the big difference in the first
half," Weber said. "Going into
the four-minute mark, they got
three or four of them down the
stretch and they kept the lead.
... Rebounding has been our
strength, and they end up pun-
king us on the boards. That's
supposed to be our strength,
and they made it their strength
this game."
The Wolverines also got
into foul trouble in the first
half, which forced Michigan
coach John Beilein to look to
his bench. -
Redshirt junior forward
Jordan Morgan and Burke sat
out 10 and six minutes of the
first half, respectively, when
each picked up his second per-
sonal foul.
McGary and freshman
guard Spike Albrecht filled
in nicely for the veterans, but
Michigan struggled offen-
sively without Burke. In the
final six minutes, the Wolver-
ines went 2-for-7 from the field
while Kansas State cut Michi-
gan's lead by seven, putting the
Wolverines up by five at the
end of the first half.
"(Foul trouble was) not con-
cerning at all," Beilein said.
"Burke had two fouls and
we have a lot of confidence
in Spike. Then we have that
third big guy if we needed him
... and thank God (redshirt
sophomore forward) Jon (Hor-
ford) was there to help us. We
haven't always had this luxury
of having that extra big guy to
help us or extra point guy. You
don't want to see anybody sit-
ting on the bench, but we know
when we turn to the bench, we
have some guys that can get in
there."
Hardaway and Burke were
named to the All-Tournament
Team along with Pitt's Talib
Zanna, Delaware's Devon Sad-
dler and Kansas State's Angel
Hernandez.

for a high stick, negating the rest
of the man-advantage.
After Ryan left the box, a huge
hit to freshman forward Jus-
tin Selman in the Cornell zone
spurred a rush that ended in a
five-hole goal from the left circle
through Michigan freshman net-
minder Steve Racine. In the wan-
ing moments of the period, the
Wolverines seemed to generate
momentum again, but freshman
defenseman Jacob Trouba took
a tough boarding penalty when a
Big Red skater turned his back to
him right as he delivered the hit.
Michigan (3-5-1-1 CCHA, 5-7-1
overall) started the second period
far crisper than it had looked in
the first. But as is so oftenthe case
in hockey, it's not which team gets
the most opportunities, but who
finishes on them.
That was ,Cornell (1-3-2 East
Coast Athletic Conference, 4-3-
2) once again at the 12:42 mark
of the second period, when a pass
from behind the net set up Teemu
Tiitinen to put the Big Red up 2-0.
Three minutes later, Cornell
extended its lead to 3-0 when a
rebound from a point shot squirt-
ed to a crashing Greg Miller who
found the back door. Despite out-
shooting the Big Red 11-5 in the
middle frame, the Wolverines
walked back to the lockeroom
trailing by three goals.
The Big Red put the final nail in
the coffin with just over 12 min-
utes to play in the game, ensur-
ing there would be no late-game
drama like last year when the two
schools met in Green Bay, Wisc.
Eric Axell netted his first goal of
the year off a wrister from the slot.
The Wolverines did end up on
the board two minutes later when
junior defenseman Mac Bennett
launched a shot from the blue line
that finally beat Cornell goalten-
der Andy Iles. Berenson described
the environment at Madison
Square Garden as having an NHL-
like feel after the game, but Sat-
urday his team didn't have the
enthusiasm to mirror the crowd.
"I'm just sorry we didn't repre-
sent Michigan better," Berenson
said.

FAILURE
From Page 1B
Michigan's failure to adjust
doomed the Wolverines on third
down.
There were fumbles and inter-
ceptions, questionable calls and
misreads. Michigan managed
just 21 plays and a meager 60
yards and zero points in the sec-
ond half, as the offense - electric
in the first half - went out with a
whimper.
Michigan faced three third
downs in the final 30 minutes.
They ran with sophomore run-
ning back Thomas Rawls for
no gain, then again with senior
Vincent Smith for no gain and
with Smith once more for a loss
of two yards. On Michigan's final
drive, junior quarterback Devin
Gardner finally threw on a third
down, and the Wolverines finally
converted.
Michigan led, 21-20, by the
time it faced its first third down of
the second half. At that moment,
Michigan running backs had
rushed just three times for a col-
lective eight yards. Robinson,
meanwhile, ignited the offense
with six rushes for 124 yards and
a touchdown in the first half,
while Gardner threw for 107
yards and a score and rushed for
another touchdown.
It was third down and three
from Michigan's 48-yard line.
Gardner, at quarterback, handed
off to sophomore running back
Thomas Rawls over the right
guard.
He didn't gain a yard.
Fourth down. After a time
out, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke elected to go for it. Rob-
inson, lined up in the shotgun.
Ohio State's defenders had been
coached to focus on Robinson,
shut off the edge when he lined
up in what they viewed as a Wild-
cat formation. .
Robinson rushed over the left
guard. He lost two yards - a
turnover on downs. The Wolver-
ines wouldn't get as far as their
own 48-yard line for the rest of
the game.
"They were a little bit predict-
able in the first half," said Ohio
State co-defensive coordinator
EverettWithers. "Youknow,they
put 16 (Robinson) back there, he
was gonna run it. And they put 12
(Gardner) back there, they were
gonna throw it. And after a while
that became something that we
keyed on."
Michigan had run the same
play it ran on fourth down three
times in the first half, all for
gains. Robinson, though, chose
the wrong gap, according to
Hoke. The play still would have
picked up the first down, but red-
shirt junior Taylor Lewan missed
a block on linebacker Ryan Shazi-
er. It was Shazier who made the
stop.
Next possession, the Wolver-
ines trailed 23-21 and had a first
down on their 44-yard line after
a 30-yard completion. Robinson
again set up in the shotgun, and

the safeties started creeping in.
"The defensive coaches told
us that we needed to stop No. 16
because we knew he wasn't going
to throw the ball because of his
wrist," said safety Christian Bry-
ant.
So with Robinson in the game
without Gardner, they crept
up. If they were lined up on the
slot receiver, they changed their
leverage and pinched into the
box.
Robinson took the snap and
ran up the middle. Bryant, play-
ing near the box, met him there
and put his helmet on the ball,
which Robinson held in his left
arm. Earlier in the week, Michi-
gan offensive coordinator said he
was not concerned that Robin-
son's injury forced him to carry
the ballin his non-dominant arm.
The hit jarred the ball loose, and
Ohio State's Nathan Williams fell
on it. Two possessions for Michi-
gan in the half. Two turnovers.
"Too many turnovers," Robin-
son said. "We had big turnovers
in the second half, and in order
for you to win this game, you
gotta control the ball."
After Michigan got the ball
back, the Wolverines faced third
down again, this time third-and-
two from their own 30-yard line.
Robinson was in at quarterback
again, and he handed to senior
running back Vincent Smith.
Smith didn't gain asyard.
Before the run, Michigan
running backs had rushed for 11
yards on six carries.
"You kinda look at where
you're at and what you feel you
may have an opportunity," Hoke
said of the third-down calls.
"You know, upstairs, you see a lot
of different things."
Michigan was again forced
to punt. Through three posses-
sions in the second half, the Wol-
verines rushed eight times for
six yards. Gardner passed three
times, all complete, for 46 yards.
The Wolverines faced a third,
third down in the fourth quar-
ter. This time, Gardner was in at
quarterback, needing one yard.
He handed off to Smith. Smith
lost two yards.
Hoke said Gardner didn't pass
more, because "they just weren't
called."
Gardner fumbled on his next
possession, and by then, Michi-
gan had lost its offensive rhythm
after three second-half turn-
overs.
"When we gave the ball back
as many times as we did in the
second half, your rhythm kinda
fades away a little bit," Hoke said.
"And thenthe clock's against you
a little bit."
By Michigan's final drive,
Meyer and the Buckeyes didn't
have to worry about Robinson.
He was out of the game, as Mich-
igan needed to pass more, Hoke
said - though Hoke also said
Robinson could have thrown on
Saturday.
Ohio State had done its job.
Robinson actually lost two yards
in the second half. Michgian, its
star neutralized, found no other
answers.

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN
IThe Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Denard-o-Meter measures the success of quarterback
Denard Robinson, the Man-o-Meter judges Michigan's "Manball," how physically it played in the trenches, and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

DENARD-O-METER
I Denard was great in the first half. Gardner was too.
2/ So why weren't they on the field together? Robin-
son rushed for 124 yards and a score in the first half.
Denards In the second, he lost two yards.

MAN-0-METER
1/4 The offensive line got dominated in the second half,
and the defensive line got bullied all game. Ohio
State gained 207 yards on the ground; aside from
Brady Hokes Robinson, Michigan lost 14.

State in The Wire. Can't get much more hype than
Big Houses this.


LOOKING GOOD

FEELING BLUE

SOPHOMORE DEFENSIVE
END FRANK CLARK:
Clark saved his best
game for the last game of
the regular season. The
sophomore was a force,
terrorizing the Buckeyes'
offensive line and harassing
quarterback Braxton Miller
in Michigan's 26-21 loss.
Clark finished with four
tackles, including two
tackles for loss, and a sack.
He also added a fumble
recovery. But his flashiest
play of the day was a hit
on Braxton in the second
quarter. Clark came
unblocked off the right
side of the line. He didn't
come from Miller's blind
side, but Miller was looking
toward the left side of the
field and didn't see Clark.
Clark hit Miller at a full
run, and the quarterback
was slow to get up before
the Buckeyes punted.

MICHIGAN RUNNING
BACKS: The Wolverines
hadn't found much
production from the running
back position even before
redshirt junior Fitzgerald
Toussaint seriously injured
his left leg last week against
Iowa. Sophomore Thomas
Rawls and fifth-year
senior Vincent Smith split
responsibilities at running
back. The pair finished
with a combined 14 yards
on 10 carries, including
three pivital third-down
rushes in the second half.
On each of those tries,
Michigan needed three
yards or less, yet Rawls,
and Smith failed to pick
up even a single yard.
Without any running
game other than Robinson,
the Ohio State defense
keyed on the quarterback
and shut Michigan down
in the second half.
