The University of Michigan’s 

Central Student Government 
met 
Tuesday 
evening 
to 

address 
topics 
including 

revisions 
to 
the 
Campus 

Affordability Guide, additional 
installations of water refill 
stations on campus, as well 
as the upcoming election for 
CSG representatives for the 
2018-2019 academic year. The 
assembly also discussed the 
continued inclusion of free 
menstrual products in various 
locations across campus.

The meeting opened with 

various 
guest 
speakers, 

including Erik Wessel, director 
of the Office of Student Conflict 
Resolution, and Gina Cervetti, 
an associate professor in the 
School of Education. Wessel 
and Cervetti spoke to the 
assembly about the process 
of amending the Statement 
of 
Student 
Rights 
and 

Responsibilities, which will 
occur next school year. Every 
three years, the Statement 
is 
open 
to 
revisions 
and 

amendments by the University 
community, 
including 
all 

students. Cervetti stressed to 
the assembly the importance 
of raising awareness of this 
student right, which may be 
unknown to many.

“I know that this has been 

a challenging time on campus 
for many members of our 
community and that some of 

these challenges have related 
to issues of campus climate,” 
Cervetti said. “This is an 
opportunity to have an active 
role in shaping that.”

Additionally, Law School 

student Tom Allen presented 
to the assembly on a ballot 
proposal for the November 2018 
election. Entitled “Promote the 
Vote,” the initiative will amend 

the 
Michigan 
Constitution 

in order to make it easier for 
Michigan residents to vote. 
The proposed initiative will 
guard the right to vote a secret 
ballot, as well as affording all 
registered voters an absentee 
ballot for any reason, among 
other changes.

“Voter 
participation 
for 

people our age (is) low,” Allen 

said. “This will make it easier 
for all of us to vote.”

According 
to 
Allen, 

the 
support 
from 
leading 

university 
student 

governments in the state will 
increase the likelihood of the 
proposal being approved. Due 
to CSG’s past endorsement of 
student voting initiatives such 

Later 
this 
month, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
will 

launch the Center for Social 
Solutions, an interdisciplinary 
organization dedicated to tackling 
contemporary social issues. Earl 
Lewis, a former University faculty 
member and administrator, who 
currently serves as president of the 
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, 
put forth the idea for the Center 
and will be moving to Ann Arbor 
in June to direct the initiative.

Lewis has a long history in 

academia. He taught at Berkeley 
from 1984 to 1989, then accepted 
a position at the University of 
Michigan, where he taught for 15 

years. Lewis relocated to Emory 
University in 2004 to serve as 
provost and teach as a faculty 
member. 

Lewis was named President 

of 
the 
Andrew 
W. 
Mellon 

Foundation in 2013 and has 
since been working in New 
York City. As president of the 
Mellon Foundation, Lewis has 
spearheaded a number of projects, 
such as a book series called “Our 
Compelling Interests: The Value 
of Diversity for Democracy and 
a Prosperous Society,” which 
explores the political and societal 
importance of diversity.

After his presidency ends 

in March, Lewis will officially 
become the head of the U-M 
Center for Social Solutions. Lewis 

As 
part 
of 
The 
National 

Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People Week, the 
University of Michigan chapter 
of NAACP hosted an event on 
Tuesday evening discussing the 
historical roots of the movement 
and how it applies to campus today. 
Student members of the NAACP 
on campus met in the Afro-
American Lounge of South Quad 
for this event. NAACP week began 
Monday night with a discussion 
event held in conjuction with the 
Ann Arbor Police Department. 

William V. Hampton, president 

of the Ann Arbor branch of the 
NAACP, was originally invited 
to the event as a guest speaker. 
However, due to a medical issue 
in his family, he was unable to 
attend.

LSA 
senior 
Isaiah 
Land, 

president 
of 
the 
University 

NAACP 
chapter, 
began 
the 

discussion by outlining major 
events the NAACP has been a 
part of since it was founded. 
Some of the ideas discussed were 
historical court cases including 
Guinn v. United States and Brown

Facing new uncertainty under President Trump, community returns to an old mission

Latinx students have become 

the fastest-growing population 
at the University of Michigan, 
swelling from 4.75 percent of the 
student body in 2012 to 6 percent 

in 2016. For decades preceding 
this recent growth, however, they 
have been organizing for greater 
institutional support for their 
community. This long history 
can easily go unacknowledged, 
as it has in recent negotiations 
between 
the 
University 
and 

student organizations, said Public 
Policy junior Yvonne Navarrete, 

former director of the Latinx 
Alliance for Community Action, 
Support and Advocacy.

Part of La Casa’s approach in 

working with the administration 
involved 
providing 
evidence 

of the decades of struggle the 
Latinx community has had at 
the University. They created a 
folder detailing data on the lack 

of Latinx representation and 
past documents of members of 
the Latinx community asking for 
University 
support. 
Navarrete 

said La Casa created this folder to

Tim Bruns, assistant professor 

of biomedical engineering at the 
University of Michigan, along 
with Rackham student Lauren 
Zimmerman, published a paper 
this month on their research for 
a therapy to help women who 
struggle 
with 
sexual 
arousal. 

This is the first therapy of its 
kind to address a solution for the 
physiological problems of women 
suffering 
from 
female 
sexual 

dysfunction.

According 
to 
the 
National 

Institutes of Health, female sexual 
dysfunction is a condition found 
worldwide.

“Female 
sexual 
dysfunction 

(FSD) is a prevalent problem, 
afflicting approximately 40% of 
women and there are few treatment 
options,” the NIH reported in 2010.

These women might have either 

physiological problems or lack 
of overall desire. Physiological 
problems include lack of orgasm, 
pain or inability to lubricate. Low 
desire means having a low libido, 
which can be the result of multiple 
factors. Professor Bruns calls these 
distinctions 
“neck-up” 
versus

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 7, 2018


plans to stay at the University for 
10 years before moving on to other 
work. 

According to Lewis, the Center 

will pull students and faculty 
“across school and disciplinary 
lines” to research current problems 
and brainstorm concrete solutions. 
The Center for Social Solutions 
will 
channel 
the 
University’s 

brainpower and resources into 
direct action.

“I came to realize that in the 

academy, in certain parts of the 
academy, we spend a lot of time 
both theorizing and studying 
problems,” Lewis said. “In other 
parts of the academy, we try to 
think 
about 
applications 
and 

clinical solutions.”

Lewis said he is interested 

in “framing the right question, 
but also coming up with the best 
solution.”

The Center for Social Solutions 

will address three key areas of 
concern. The first pillar of the 
center’s mission is diversity and 

race. One project related to race 
issues will be the “Our Compelling 
Interests” book series, which 
Lewis will continue working on at 
the University.

“I’m bringing it with me to 

Michigan and to the Center,” he 
said. “We have published two 
books so far to date in partnership 
with Princeton University Press. 
We have subsequent volumes 
already either in development or 
poised to come out in the next 
year.” 

The Center for Social Solutions 

will develop other initiatives, 
beyond the book series, to address 
what Lewis says is “the nation’s 
need to think about diversity as an 
asset.”

In 
addition, 
Lewis 
hopes 

to work through the center to 
increase dialogue about the history 
and legacy of U.S. slavery.

“What we want to do with the 

center is to work with universities, 
museums, arts orgs, theatres, 
social justice institutions, public 
parks, national parks, etc. to begin 
to look at that history in a more 
integrated fashion,” Lewis said. 
“So much about the American 
present, even when it’s not stated, 

is about that part of the American 
past. Slavery looms there in the 
shadows, and what we want to do 
is actually see if we can’t bring it 
out into the spotlight and deal with 
it directly.”

The center will also address 

issues of water access. Lewis wants 
to develop a model for moving 
water “from flood-prone areas to 
drought-stricken areas.”

“It’s 
not 
an 
engineering 

problem, we can actually move 
water,” Lewis said. “It’s a fiscal 
problem. It’s a regulatory problem. 
It’s an environmental problem. It’s 
a social problem.”

One 
reason 
that 
water 

distribution is a social issue, 
says Lewis, is that proximity 
to water often correlates with 
socioeconomic status.

The final focus area of the 

Center for Social Solutions is 
the future of work in the face of 
increasing 
automation. 
Lewis 

sees new technology as important 
and 
beneficial, 
but 
considers 

job displacement as a result of 
mechanization a serious social 
concern.

“My question about the future 

of work is this: How do we think 
about the dignity of labor in an 
automated world?” Lewis said.

The center will conceptualize 

ways to make new technology 
considerate of human needs.

“I want the center to really 

work with the technologists who 
are developing these new tools 
and these new systems and these 
new ways of working to think 
about the dignity of labor and how 
we craft that into all our design 
features,” Lewis said.

The three core interests of 

the Center for Social Solutions 
are, in Lewis’s opinion, urgent 
and challenging problems. Still, 
he thinks the center will be 
adequately equipped to address 
race, water and the future of work.

“These are three projects that I 

can imagine, in partnership with 
others, that we can solve some 
parts of, if not the whole thing,” 
Lewis said. “If we’re successful by 
any measure it will improve the 
common good.”

The idea for the Center for 

Social Solutions has been in 
the works for quite some time. 
In developing his plan, Lewis 

reached out to colleagues across 
the country, discussing the 
feasibility of a Center for Social 
Solutions.

Lewis decided to establish the 

center in Ann Arbor because of 
the University’s many resources 
and because of his connection to 
the University.

Faculty 
members 
and 

administrators at the University 
were 
receptive 
to 
Lewis’s 

proposal. President Schlissel, 
LSA Dean Andrew Martin and 
Provost Martin Philbert have 
worked alongside Lewis to pave 
the way for the Center for Social 
Solutions.

“Earl Lewis is an outstanding 

historian and educator, and 
we are fortunate that he is 
returning to the University of 
Michigan,” Dean Martin said 
in a press release. “Not only 
will he be a strong leader for 
the Center for Social Solutions, 
but he will provide wisdom and 
experience as a faculty member 
in LSA’s departments of History 
and Afroamerican and African 
Studies.”

Over the summer, Lewis will 

continue to sort out logistical 
and administrative details, such 
as hiring staff and acquiring 
space on campus.

Lewis has a specific vision for 

how the project will unfold. The 
Center for Social Solutions will be 
organized into “collaboratories,” 
or interdisciplinary groups of 
people focused on the same 
problem. Lewis hopes to get 
students involved in the center’s 
work as research assistants 
and team members. In fact, the 
center will eventually offer a 
curriculum tied to various social 
projects.

Lewis believes the Center 

for Social Solutions will be an 
impactful way for students to 
put the skills they learn in the 
classroom to use.

“Imagine yourself being able 

to, 10 years from now, say, ‘I 
worked on something where we 
not only crafted a question, but 
we came up with a solution,’” 
Lewis said. 

A $2,500,000 women’s athletic 

building, complete with the long 
awaited swimming pool, will be 
constructed in the near future, ac-
cording to University officials.

Preliminary plans call for a one 

million dollar swimming pool unit 
to be built first, Prof. H. O Crisler, 
athletic director, revealed. The 
exact date for starting the construc-
tion has not been set.

The building will be constructed 

on the southeast corner of S. Forest 
Ave. anti N. University Ave. The 
houses now located on the Univer-
sity property will be moved.

Lester F. Etter, public relations 

manager for the athletic depart-
ment, was less certain than Crisler 
about plans for the new building.

“I’m not positive of the exact 

location of the proposed building,” 
Etter said. “Its construction will be 
sometime in the future and it’s hard 
to say exactly about some details.” 

Prof. Crisler said the struc-

ture had been authorized by the 
Board of Regents and the Board in 
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics. 
Three architects, Lee and Kenneth 
C. Black of Lansing and Alden Dow 

of Midland, are now working on 
plans for the building.

“We have funds now for the 

pool unit only,” Prof. Crisler said. 
“We’ll leave the rest of the project 
to be constructed when we get the 
money.

“The $1,000,000 available 

for the construction of the pool 
resulted in part from the profits, of 
the University’s intercollegiate ath-
letics program, principally football 
receipts,” he explained.

Several student drives through 

the years also have added to the 
million dollar fund. Outstanding 
among these is Michigras which 
turned $3,050 into the fund coffers 
last spring.

However, Crisler said that they 

are going to proceed and draw 
plans for the full building. “We 
have to look forward to the even-
tual loss through age of Waterman 
and Barbour Gymnasiums.”

Tentative plans for the swim-

ming pool unit call for a three-story 
building, housing a six lane

pool, 75 by 44 feet and adequate 

locker and shower facilities.

“We have considered estimates 

that include spectator space 
for 300 to 1,500 persons,” Prof.. 
Margaret Bell, chairman of the 
department of physical education 
for women, declared.

The remainder of the building 

which will be constructed at a later 
date will contain two

gymnasiums with enough floor 

space to interchange indoor and 
outdoor physical education activi-
ties.

Other facilities for the build-

ing would include therapeutic 
gymnastic equipment, small games 
rooms, classrooms, special facilities 
for a teacher education program’, 
offices, staff rooms, locker facilities 
and a possible laboratory.

The lack of swimming pool 

facilities for women has been for a 
long time a problem with the wom-
en’s athletic department. Women 
have been forced to practice their 
aquatic abilities in the Union pool, 
I-M. Bldg. pool. or a small tank in 
Barbour Gymnasium.

Amid an immigration crisis, 

gun control debate and delicate 
foreign relations landscape, it 
would seem as though President 
Donald Trump would not have a 
lot of time to tweet.

However, 
early 
Tuesday 

morning Trump defied odds 
again, firing up his Twitter 
account before dawn. The tweet 
was 122 characters mocking an 
issue one wouldn’t expect to be at 
the top of any presidential agenda: 
The TV ratings of the Oscars.

To respond to the growing 

presence of social media, even 
among 
national 
leaders, 
the 

University of Michigan is creating 
a new Center for Social Media 
Responsibility, which will be 
housed within the School of 
Information, aiming to explore 
the meaning and threats behind 
social media, a channel Trump 
has utilized as the centerpiece of 
his communication strategy.

Information 
School 
Dean 

Thomas Finholt was inspired 
by 
this 
growing 
dialogue 

surrounding social media and 
made the establishment of the 
center a priority when he assumed 
the position in 2016.

According 
to 
Finholt, 
the 

technological 
revolution 
has 

been trailed by the question of 
the global impact of mass public 
communication.

“From the earliest days of 

the 
internet, 
technologists 

envisioned 
the 
benefits 
of 

broader access to the means of 
public 
communication: 
social 

mobility, resistance to despotism, 
universal authorship and open 
source software,” Finholt said in a 
University press release.

The center will be headed by 

one of former President Barack 
Obama’s social media managers, 
Garlin Gilchrist II. Gilchrist is 
a Detroit native who graduated 
from the University of Michigan 
with degrees in computer science 
and computer engineering. His 

career both in the White House 
and most recently working for 
the City of Detroit highlights 
his passion for working at the 
intersection of technology and 
politics. 

“Our job is to create tools, and 

to use and make our research 
usable 
to 
media 
makers, 

media consumers to platform 
companies, to make sure we 
deal with this ongoing threat 
of more difficult-to-understand 
and potential misinformation,” 
Gilchrist said.

The center will be funded 

with the internal resources 
of the Information School in 
addition to financial support 
from the Office of the Provost.

“neck-down” problems.

“Women’s sexual response is a 

lot more complicated than men’s,” 
Bruns said.

The female sexual stimulant 

drug, often referred to as Addyi, 
was made available in 2015 to help 
address women with a low libido. 
However, to this point, no such 
therapy exists for improving the 
sexual response of women relating 
to their “neck-down” problems, or 
problems in their genitalia.

In this published study, Bruns’s 

lab used the same therapy that 
exists to treat bladder issues 
on 16 rats in order to see if this 
would cause arousal. The process 
includes injecting a needle into a 
part of the rat’s leg, anesthetizing 
them and watching their blood 
flow. After 30 minutes, arousal 
was determined by an increase in 
their vaginal blood flow.

Bruns indicated he does not 

know why the study results 
showed this treatment causes 
increased stimulation for the rats. 
The lab intends to do the same 
study on awake conscious rats and 
get similar results.

At the same time as this work 

is being published, the lab is also 
working on a clinical study giving 
women subjects the same therapy 
the rats received. The purpose 
of this is to see how the therapy 
affects women with FSD.

Only women who scored a 

certain number indicating their 
levels of FSD on a survey were 
included. Participants take the 
survey before the trial, in the 
middle and at the end in order to 
see if their scores increase over 
time. The results of this study will 
be published later this year.

Bruns noted he received much 

feedback throughout the study.

“One person who had low 

sexual desire wrote this long story 
about how her husband thinks she 
is cheating on him and she is so 
glad this work is being done,” he 
said. “There is potential for a large 
impact for this which I think is 
really cool.”

Looking toward the future, 

Bruns 
noted 
he 
could 
see 

the therapy eventually being 
transformed into a type of shoe 
that women can wear. If anything, 
he would like this research to 
open up opportunities for people 
to discuss their sexual habits and 
functions.

“Part of my work is for people 

realizing that they are not alone,” 
Bruns said.

The prospect of this research 

excites campus activists. LSA 
junior Antonia Vrana, publicity 
chair for Women’s Organization 
on Rights to Health, a student 
organization 
committed 
to 

advocating for women’s health, 
commented on how this type of 
research can help bring women’s 
health issues into the conversation 
with in the University community.

“I think that the development 

of drugs like this for women’s 
health rights as a whole could 
normalize taking a more active 
role to embrace sexuality,” Vrana 
said. “As students and people 
from a young generation, it is 
really promising to hear that for 
the future, especially because 
female sexual dysfunction is not 
so discussed.”

Zimmerman first got involved 

when 
Bruns 
explained 
the 

ongoing work to her. Zimmerman 
was intrigued by the project 
because “it struck a chord within 
the feminist in me to work on a 
project that is for women.”

new, that the reason they don’t 
serve us that well is because they 
haven’t yet adapted to our new, 
growing population,” Navarrete 
said. “Part of us addressing 
that was creating this folder we 
shared with all of our members, 
you have access to and it’s open. 
It adds historical context to our 
issues.”

Over 
the 
years, 
however, 

the issues facing Latino and 
undocumented 
students 
at 

the University have, in some 
ways, evolved. The Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
policygranting 
undocumented 

students 
certain 
protections, 

enacted via executive order by 
President Obama in 2012, filled 
Navarrete with optimism. She 
acquired DACA status in 2013, 
and from then on, focused on the 
jobs, programs and opportunities 
made available to her.

Yet, with the start of President 

Donald Trump’s administration 
and his promise to revoke DACA, 
she no longer has this luxury — 
now, the idea of being deported 
remains at the forefront of her 
thoughts.

“We have to regress and go 

back to thinking about the very 
real danger of being deported and 
more intense ICE enforcement 
and border control,” Navarrete 
said. “That’s been the hardest 
part. We were granted something 
and then they took it away. That’s 
the part that’s the scariest: the 
uncertainty part.”

Postdoctoral fellow William 

Lopez said this feeling is one 
affecting 
many 
DACA-status 

students, and can be crippling.

“What is it like to not know 

if tomorrow when you wake if 
you are going to be deportable 
or not?” Lopez said. “Tomorrow 
when you wake up you won’t 
be able to go to your job and 
you won’t be able to drive. You 
know, this is having a real impact 
on folks who have for the past 
three to four years lived in some 
relative safety from deportation 
and now have no idea what the 
future is going to hold from 
them.”

The most basic benefit of 

DACA is the two-year protection 
against deportation of people 
brought into the United States 
illegally as children. The other 
major 
advantage 
is 
DACA 

recipients’ ability to acquire 
work permits, which can further 
allow them to receive health care 
and pay for higher education.

Trump’s 
inauguration 
into 

the White House in 2017 brought 
Engineering 
senior 
Javier 

Contreras-Uribe back to reality, 
just like Navarrete. He said during 
the Obama administration, he 
had allowed himself to let down 
his guard and now, he is facing 
the consequences.

“As 
far 
as 
the 
other 

undocumented students that I 
know, we all sort of have the same 
feeling that things are getting 
real, that we got too comfortable 
and that now it is coming back to 
bite us,” Contreras said. “A lot of 
people stopped organizing, like I 
said, we got too comfortable.”

And according to Navarrete, 

being a part of the University 

creates 
this 
false 
sense 
of 

security. She said it can be easy 
to feel safe on campus and forget 
the danger surrounding her.

“When I’m in class or walking 

through campus, I kind of live 
in a bubble where I can almost 
forget about things,” Navarrete 
said. “This bubble, it’s false 
because at any point you can get 
deported. When you create a 
distance between your at-home 
community and this community, 
at least for me, you almost feel 
this false sense of safety.”

Undocumented students said 

they felt the threat of deportation 
last January when U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection showed 
up on campus. They parked their 
vehicle behind the Michigan 
Union, causing a panic among 
students and faculty.

It ended up being that CBP 

was on campus to recruit at a 
career fair held in the Union. But 
the sign of CBP’s presence was 
enough to remind Navarrete of 
her insecure status, even under 
the protection of the University.

“Last year at the career center 

they invited CBP and the CBP 
patrol car parked crookedly on 
the street, and the people in the 
career center were all geared 
up,” Navarrete said. “Those are 
little things that can remind you 
of the very real fears and dangers 
that can happen anywhere you 
are even when you’re safe on 
campus.”

There are little differences 

undocumented 
students 

experience going about their 
daily lives, such as friends 
discussing study abroad plans. 
But LSA senior Hwi Sun Yoo said 
the largest difference between 
the daily lives of undocumented 
students and those of others is 
the amount of stress involved. 
On top of schoolwork, clubs and 
part-time jobs, these students 
have 
to 
worry 
about 
their 

residence in the U.S. Yoo also 
noted his concern for his family’s 
safety is especially high.

“I think just about anyone 

you talk to will say that it’s their 
family they’re most worried 
about,” Yoo said. “Right now we 
are protected under DACA even 
if it’s temporary, but something 
as minor as a traffic ticket could 
really hurt our parents.”

Despite 
these 
fears, 
Yoo 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of 
being 
vocal 
about 
his 

undocumented identity. He said 
Trump’s election triggered his 
decision to disclose his status. He 
wanted to raise the awareness of 
undocumented student issues.

“The fact that we’re such an 

invisible community has always 
been 
a 
double-edged 
sword 

because, on one hand, it’s really 
hard to target undocumented 
people 
because 
there’s 
no 

distinguishing physical feature,” 
Yoo said. “On the other hand, 
it does make us an invisible 
community and without people 
speaking up, and calling out, 
and talking about the issues that 
we’re facing other people have no 
idea of knowing them.”

Navarrete acknowledged the 

difficulty of disclosing — when 
she first told her high school 
counselor she was a DACA-
status student, her counselor 
seemed startled. This reaction, 
she said, made her wary of telling 
anyone else. But she ultimately 

became vocal in college for the 
same reason as Yoo: To raise 
awareness, and to better her 
situation as an undocumented 
student. She noted how the 
recent discussions of DACA in 
the government have increased 
awareness significantly.

“It started this huge wave of 

awareness and now everyone 
knows what DACA is, which I feel 
like is the silver lining of what’s 
currently happening,” Navarrete 
said. “It was way different a year 
ago. I had to constantly explain it 
no matter where I went.”

Navarrete and Yoo are part of a 

student group for undocumented 
students 
called 
Student 

Community 
of 
Progressive 

Empowerment. SCOPE aims to 
build community and to advocate 
for 
undocumented 
student 

issues. Last semester, they held 
a rally on the last day of DACA 
renewal submissions to push 
for more University support and 
resources.

They 
also 
met 
with 

administrators and presented 
them 
with 
four 
demands: 

Granting them a primary contact 
person 
for 
undocumented 

students, 
fulfilling 
financial 

need, improving outreach to 
prospective 
undocumented 

students and altering a policy 
requiring students to enroll 
28 months after high school 
graduation — as 28 months, they 
argued, is often not enough time 
for students to gather enough 
money for college.

The 
first 
demand 
was 

met 
successfully 
with 
the 

appointment of Hector Galvan 
as 
undocumented 
students 

program coordinator.

Yoo 
said 
she 
feels 
the 

appointment of Galvan has been 
helpful in working with the 
administration.

“When 
I 
initially 
got 

more 
involved 
within 
the 

undocumented 
community, 

there were not many resources 
to work with in the school, but 
with the appointment of Hector, 
I feel like a lot has changed, quite 
rapidly to be honest,” Yoo said. 
“We’ve gotten a lot of work done 
this semester.”

Galvan’s role is to serve the 

undocumented 
students 
and 

DACA recipients on campus by 
being the bridge between the 
students and the administration. 
In an email interview, he said he 
is currently working on gaining 
the support of more allies on 
campus.

“As we know, this initiative 

is fairly new to the university, 
I am also working on building 
a referral network of allies 
throughout campus to provide 
additional 
support,” 
Galvan 

wrote.

Earlier this semester, La Casa 

presented 
the 
administration 

with their own list of demands. 
These 
demands 
centered 

around working to have more 
Latinx 
representation 
within 

the 
administration, 
more 

support for Latinx students and 
an 
appreciative 
environment 

surrounding 
the 
Latinx 

community. La Casa made sure 
the document containing the 
demands 
was 
comprehensive 

and accessible to everyone.

The 
reason 
SCOPE’s 

demands were less publicized, 
Navarrete said, was because 

that 
community 
is 
smaller 

and also more invisible. She 
also said SCOPE had to have a 
different approach with their 
demands because it is hard for 
the University to provide more 
undocumented 
representation, 

as that community has less 
access to those jobs.

SCOPE hasn’t yet compiled 

documents 
describing 
the 

history of undocumented student 
struggles, but there certainly has 
been a history in recent years. In 
2013, the Coalition for Tuition 
Equality fought for the right of 
resident undocumented students 
to receive in-state tuition — a 
fight Contreras was a part of.

Contreras said since then, 

the University has created a 
program to help DACA students 
financially each year, though the 
existence of the program seems 
precarious. 

“The issue with DACA is 

you can’t receive FAFSA, just 
because it is federal aid, or loans 
as well, so the University did set 
up a pilot program, the keyword 
is pilot,” Contreras said. “Every 
year the Regents vote on it to 
decide how much funding there 
will be and if there will be any 
funding at all. So far, we have 
gotten lucky, ever since 2013 they 
have been continuously voting to 
fund it.”

The University has stated its 

support for the undocumented 
student 
community 
multiple 

times. Last January, President 
Schlissel released a statement 
pledging his support of students 
regardless of their immigration 
status and his refusal to disclose 
their statuses. This Friday, after 
the Supreme Court refused to 
hear the appeal of DACA ruling, 
he released another statement 
reiterating his support.

Galvan believes the University 

should carry on with their 
current work in supportingW 
the undocumented community 
and should aim to provide more 
resources.

“The 
university 
should 

support the student population 
by continuing the efforts they 
are 
doing 
now 
in 
addition 

to 
expanding 
resources 

thoughtfully,” Galvan wrote.

Navarrete 
wishes, 
though, 

for the Office of Enrollment 
Management 
specifically 
to 

be more vocal. She thinks if 
they voice their support, they 
could 
have 
a 
large 
impact 

in 
encouraging 
prospective 

undocumented students to apply 
to the University.

“I 
think 
the 
Office 
of 

Enrollment 
Management 
is 

the one I feel like has not been 
responsive,” 
Navarrete 
said. 

“And it can be the most powerful 
one in serving undocumented 
students because it encompasses 
financial aid, admissions and the 
registrar’s office, and those are 
the three offices that obstruct 
the people from coming to U-M.”

Yoo said even though resources 

for undocumented students may 
be improving right now with the 
appointment of Galvan and the 
continued discussions with the 
administration, the struggle will 
always be constant.

“Just because we’re doing well 

right now, I don’t want people 
thinking the issues are over,” Yoo 
said. “It’s always going to be an 
uphill battle.”

v. Board of Education, as well as 
other events throughout the civil 
rights movement. The students 
also discussed the film, “The 
Birth of a Nation” in detail since 
the NAACP worked to stop the 
distribution of this film featuring 
the Ku Klux Klan.

“The NAACP has been around 

since 1909,” Land said. “We want 
to look at where we’ve been 
and figure out where we can go, 
maximizing our political power.”

The students then discussed the 

beginning of the NAACP chapter 
at 
the 
University 
specifically. 

Ravi Perry founded the NAACP 
at the University in 2002 after 
spending a summer as an intern 
in Washington D.C., recalling 
the lack of a Black experience on 
campus with respect to socio-
political activism.

“In 2002, there was a lot going 

on,” Land said. “They wanted to 
get people out to vote.”

LSA junior Timberlee Whiteus 

highlighted 
the 
differences 

between the Black Student Union 
and the NAACP, which include the 
political nature of the NAACP.

“NAACP is seen as a national 

organization,” Whiteus said. “And 
this is a place where we can have 

conversations about change and 
protests and who we need to write 
to.”

Land 
explained 
the 
seven 

committees of the University’s 
chapter, which include Health 
and 
Awareness, 
Membership, 

Education, Finance, Program and 
Research, Press and Publicity and 
Political Action/Juvenile Justice.

Land 
also 
stressed 
the 

importance of the organization in 
providing support and reaching 
out to freshmen on campus.

“We really want to get traction 

going into next year especially,” 
Land said. “A lot of freshmen 
come in and there’s culture shock 
because they don’t understand that 
Michigan isn’t the place that they 
show you on the pamphlet.”

LSA 
freshman 
Darlena 

York added from her personal 
experience, getting in touch with 
first-year students was important 
for NAACP.

“It is difficult for freshmen,” 

York said. “It was weird walking 
in to see four Black people amidst 
a bunch of people who don’t look 
like me.”

The 
event 
concluded 
with 

Land urging students to sign up 
for various committees and get 
involved.

“We don’t have to change the 

world in one day, but exercising 
our power politically is something 
we need to focus on,” Land said.

as the Big Ten Voting Challenge 
and Turn Up Turnout, Promote 
the Vote aims to garner backing 
from the University and to show 
students are seeking greater 
access to voting.

Following the guest speakers, 

CSG President Anushka Sarkar, 
an LSA senior, announced the 
upcoming release of the CSG 
demographic 
report, 
which 

will provide various data about 
the majority of the current 
assembly. In addition, Sarkar 
discussed 
the 
possibility 
of 

presenting a resolution to invest 
in revamping the University 
Health Services as well as other 
health resources on campus, due 
to an alleged lack of funding 
over the past few years. Efforts 
are continually being made to 
fight food insecurity on campus, 
according to Sarkar.

In addition to referencing 

the beginning of the revision 

process 
of 
the 
Campus 

Affordability Guide, which was 
criticized as out of touch and 
insensitive to the issues faced 
by low-income students, CSG 
Vice President Nadine Jawad, a 
Public Policy senior, proposed 
a resolution to urge University 
administration 
to 
include 

Middle Eastern/North African 
students 
into 
demographic 

research. 
Especially 
with 

the increased immigration of 
ME/NA individuals to areas 
such as Dearborn, Jawad said, 
there is a heightened need for 
representation of these groups 
beyond 
a 
racial 
or 
ethnic 

category marked “Other.”

“Not having this demographic 

report information … means that 
students are disadvantaged in 
(the allocation of) resources,” 
Jawad said.

CSG concluded their meeting 

by 
passing 
resolutions 
to 

promote and fund new Battle of 
the Orgs program and to support 
and fund an event empowering 
women and promoting the role 
of women in government.

A beginner’s guide to effective gun control

More than just a wall

I

n the wake of the latest horrific 
tragedy of the mass shooting 
variety, our nation’s leaders 

seemed to engage in the same 
song and dance they do every time 
something like this happens.

Take Senate Majority Leader 

Mitch 
McConnell, 
R-Ky., 
for 

example. After the unspeakable 
shooting at Sandy Hook, where 20 
children between the ages of six and 
seven were murdered, the Majority 
Leader said the following: “I invite 
everyone to lift their hearts in prayer 
for the victims and their families and 
to unite around the hope that there 
will soon come a day when parents 
no longer fear this kind of violence in 
our nation again.” At the same time, 
Sen. McConnell blocked all bills on 
gun reform from making it to the 
floor.

Similarly, 
after 
the 
Pulse 

nightclub massacre, Sen. McConnell 
held a moment of silence, and then 
proceeded to silence all debate 
on gun reform. Finally, after last 
month’s shooting at Stoneman 
Douglas High School where 17 high 
school students were murdered in 
one of the deadliest school shootings 
in the world, you can probably guess 
the extent of Sen. McConnell’s 
action. If you had guessed thoughts, 
prayers and a moment of silence, 
then you were unfortunately dead 
on.

One of the reasons these 

politicians, mostly representing the 
Republican Party, have gotten away 
with this kind of reaction is because 
of a dedicated “smoke and mirror” 
campaign. These so-called leaders 
almost seem to follow a shared 
playbook when a mass shooting 
occurs. In the 24 hours after the 
event, they offer their thoughts and 
prayers, hold moments of silence 
and seem to genuinely grieve for 
the families. After that period of 
time passes, they condemn anyone 
who spoke out in favor of more gun 
control for politicizing the tragedy, 
effectively politicizing the event 
themselves.

For example, almost exactly 24 

hours after the atrocity at Stoneman 
Douglas High School, Ted Cruz 
levied the following charge at 
Democrats on national television: 
“The reaction of Democrats to any 
tragedy is to try to politicize it.” 
Then, as sadness turns to anger 
throughout 
the 
country, 
these 

politicians start a mass information 
campaign, pointing their fingers 

at any and all actors who are not 
part of the gun industry, including 
themselves. 
Republican 
leaders 

blamed the police, the FBI, the 
school’s administration and even 
the students in Parkland, Fla. 
To a certain extent, they weren’t 
wrong. The FBI had received tips 
about the shooter even though it is 
legally murky what they could have 
done. Furthermore, police did not 
swiftly enter the building, which 
could have potentially limited the 
number of casualties. However, 
blaming teachers and students 
for not reporting the shooter was 
ludicrous. It’s a tactic I know well 
as a former high school debater — 
throw out as many arguments as 
possible and hope that one sticks. 
Except, in this case, the goal isn’t to 
win tournaments as much as save 
people’s lives.

Curiously, one argument these 

politicians never seemed to land 
on is more effective gun control. 
They claim if everything else went 
perfectly, a crazy person would never 
be able to have a gun and use it at a 
school. They claim it’s not a problem 
with the laws themselves, but the 
execution of the laws that exist. They 
claim we’ve done everything we can. 
But, we empirically have not. Just 
a cursory glance at gun laws in our 
country and across the world shows 
gun reform can and has saved lives. 
To make it easier for them, because 
I understand a certain leader of ours 
prefers bullet points, I will list just 
a few of these policies with a brief 
description of each:

1. Assault rifle ban: The United 

States banned assault rifles between 
1994 and 2004. There was a marked 
decrease in gun massacre incidents 
as a result and an increase after it 
was allowed to lapse. In Australia, 
an assault rifle ban and gun buyback 
program has saved an estimated 200 

lives per year.

2. Background checks: Boston 

University found that universal 
background checks and ammunition 
background checks significantly 
decreased 
gun 
mortality 
by 

comparing states that have those 
laws to states that don’t.

3. Gun violence restraining 

order: In recent mass shootings, 
there have often been red flags 
associated with the shooter. For 
example, various people close to 
the Stoneman Douglas High School 
shooter were aware that he posed 
a threat but had no legal resource. 
In cases such as these, individuals 
should be able to petition the court to 
confiscate a weapon from someone 
the court deems as a danger to 
oneself or others.

4. Bump stock ban: Bump 

stocks are gun modifications that 
allow semi-automatic weapons to 
operate similarly to fully automatic 
weapons. Bump stocks often come 
with 60 to 100-round magazines. A 
ban on these devices could limit the 
carnage a gun can bring.

5. Gun licenses: Federal law 

does not mandate that people acquire 
a gun license before purchasing a 
gun, and there is no process of gun 
registration. One study found that 
if such a law were to be enacted, 
projected mortality could be reduced 
by 84 percent.

6. Thoughts/prayers: To date, 

no scientific research has shown this 
particular method to be effective 
in preventing the death of innocent 
individuals.

I am not sure any of these 

reforms will work. While there 
seems to be real evidence that they 
can save lives, no one can be sure 
what effect they will have on the gun 
violence that plagues our country. 
But that’s exactly my argument; 
conservative leaders cannot claim to 
have tried everything without giving 
firearm reform a chance. We owe it to 
the people of Parkland, Fla., Orlando, 
Las Vegas, Newtown, Conn. and too 
many others to halt the shedding of 
innocent blood. Moreover, we owe it 
to the next town that has to face the 
inestimable pain of burying loved 
ones if we don’t do everything in 
our power to never have to utter the 
words “thoughts and prayers” under 
these circumstances again.

REBECCA SCHAENZEL | OP-ED

“

Borders 
are 
an 

obstacle 
to 
unity, 
to 

humanity really,” Chico 

MacMurtrie exclaimed during 
his presentation of his Border 
Crosser robots. Do borders 
just continue to reinforce a 
tendency toward isolationism 
and separate us from one 
another? Borders might isolate 
us from a true immersion 
into 
multiculturalism, 
but 

what poses a real obstacle 
to humanity is a wall, a 
fortification of a nation.

A strong push for a border 

separating Mexico and the 
United 
States 
once 
more 

moves into the spotlight with 
President Trump’s proposal 
on the DACA debate that he 
would grant citizenship to 
the 1.8 million immigrants in 
exchange for $25 billion in 
funding for his border.

The “security” of a wall was 

one of his campaign promises, 
but the thing with walls is 
they merely function as a 
filter. It deters those who seek 
a better life for themselves 
and their family, but not those 
adversaries who pose a threat 
to the nation, as they will find 
a way to circumvent a wall. As 
Jack Anderson said, “Security 
cannot depend on the hope 
that a fortification will not 
fail. Eventually, and always, 
walls fail us.”

Walls are a failed concept 

as they only offer a temporary 
relief to a problem that lies 
much deeper and needs to be 
addressed with policy reforms 

instead of physical separation. 
Walls 
are 
not 
permanent 

solutions, as evidenced by 
those that have been erected 
in the past. As Cicero decried, 
seeking justification in past 
practices is flawed in the most 
basic sense that not everything 
found in law is just, even if 
measured 
against 
history. 

The logic to keep “others” 
out once before led the U.S. 
to protect its nationhood and 
sovereignty on the basis of 
prejudicial 
exclusion 
with 

the Chinese Exclusion Act of 
1882. What is most damaging 
about this type of approach 
to immigration control is the 
delay it causes to sustainable 
immigration reform.

It is time to rethink the 

way we view borders. A wall 
will not instill unity, but 
rather perpetuate a divide, 
especially if it is brought 
about by coercion or somehow 
forcing Mexico to pay for 
it. International treaties or 
agreements 
signed 
under 

threats or coercion are not only 

invalid, as stated by Article 
52 of the Vienna Convention, 
but can also reproduce neo-
imperial relations that will 
only strain alliances among 
the global community. While 
borders should certainly exist 
as 
jurisdictional 
measures, 

a wall will form a barrier to 
human 
movement 
and 
all 

under the excuse of protecting 
one’s sovereignty.

There 
are 
additional 

consequences 
to 
be 

considered when building a 
wall such as the caging effect, 
a positive correlation between 
increased border enforcement 
and unauthorized migrants 
settling permanently instead 
of traveling back and forth 
in fear of apprehension. By 
dividing geographical space, 
we inherently separate what 
makes us human: a sense of 
community and togetherness. 
Regulation is warranted, but 
by falling back on the idea of 
imposing a barrier between 
you 
and 
the 
enemy 
we 

continue to feed into a flawed 
way of thinking.

Some 
might 
look 
at 

“them,” the Mexicans, as the 
threat, but maybe one day, 
future generations will look 
back at this moment in time 
and look at the ones erecting 
walls as a threat to unity 
and what it means to be part 
of a community, a global 
community.

F

rom 
1963—1973 
the 

“Northeast 
state” 
of 

Nigeria 
experienced 

one of the largest population 
growths in recorded history. In 
that decade, the population grew 
by 49 percent (in comparison 
the U.S. grew around 12 percent 
and China by 26 percent during 
the same period).

Or at least that’s what the 

1973 Nigerian census said. 
This data was later announced 
to be grossly inaccurate and 
the 
Nigerian 
government 

was forced to declare the 
1973 census null and void 
amid a scandal of “deliberate 
falsification of data to gain 
economic, political, and/or 
ethnic advantage.”

Contrary to popular belief, 

censuses are far from neutral. 
Though they are supposed to 
be an accurate representation 
of the population and societal 
metrics 
(unemployment, 

birth rate, marriage rate), 
they are often subject to “data 
politicization,” 
a 
process 

by which government data 
is manipulated to pursue a 
political goal.

While it is true that there 

are many flaws with censuses 
(see 
gerrymandering 
and 

episode six of the first season 
of “The West Wing”), data 
politicization is a deliberate 
action 
that 
is 
used 
to 

underrepresent, misrepresent 
or altogether make a particular 
population invisible.

A prime example is the 

American census. According 
to Becky Pettit, professor of 
sociology from the University 
of Texas at Austin, “there 
have been different periods 
of American history where 
different 
subgroups 
of 

the population have been 
uncounted, 
undercounted, 

under enumerated, missing, 
invisible.” Pettit points to 
the fact that since 1942, the 
U.S. census has been based 
on a survey of household 
information. 
“We’ve 
been 

conducting 
the 
survey 

effectively the same way to 
gauge the health and well-

being, economic skills and 
capacities of the American 
population 
since 
1942 
… 

(Which) 
categorically 

exclude people who aren’t 
living in households.” Pettit 
identifies 
the 
massive 

incarcerated 
population 
of 

the U.S. as a group that is 
particularly 
affected. 
She 

details, “By 2015 almost ¾ 
of one percent of Americans 
were incarcerated in prisons 
or jails … Approximately 2.2 
million Americans.” In other 
words, 
almost 
all 
national 

surveys render the incarcerated 
population invisible. 

However, the effects of 

census 
politicization 
are 

not 
confined 
to 
America. 

Take the issue of Rohingya 
identification in the 2014 
Myanmar 
census 
for 

example. 
The 
Myanmar 

government claims that the 
Rohingya are illegal Bengali 
immigrants. 
Contrastingly, 

the Rohingya see themselves 
as an indigenous population. 
According to reports, “In 
a 
last-minute 
decision, 

the 
Myanmar 
government 

announced that it would not 
allow members of the Muslim 
minority in Rakhine State to 
self-report their ethnicity to 
enumerators as ‘Rohingya.’” 
Though certainly not a direct 
causation, this erasure of 
Rohingya 
identity 
on 
the 

census was fundamental in 
the events that led to the 2017 
massacre of the Rohingya 
population. 
By 
making 

the 
Rohingya 
population 

“invisible” on paper and not 
providing any sort of official 

estimate 
of 
population 

size, it was much easier for 
Myanmar’s 
government 

to carry out a series of 
massacres that led to the 
deaths of more than 1,000 and 
the displacement of 300,000 
Rohingya as of September 1, 
2017. 

Finally, take a look at the 

case of the data collected 
in 1997 by the Palestinian 
Authority’s 
Bureau 
of 

Statistics. 
According 
to 

numerous scholars, including 
Yoram Ettinger and Caroline 
Glick, the population of Arabs 
living 
in 
the 
Palestinian 

territories has been greatly 
inflated.

In 
particular, 
Ettinger 

identifies 
almost 
400,000 

Palestinians 
living 
abroad, 

300,000 Jerusalem Arabs with 
dual ID cards who have been 
double 
counted 
by 
Israelis 

and 
Palestinians, 
and 
an 

overexaggerated Arab birth rate. 
This, among other disparities, 
contributes to a total of almost 
1.15 million “invisible” Arabs 
who aren’t counted in the census. 

The importance of this 

apparent 
miscalculation 

cannot be overstated. This 
existence or absence of 1.15 
million Arabs can very well 
determine which group (Jews 
or Arabs) will be the majority 
demographic in the land.

On a final note, censuses 

are not inherently a bad 
thing. 
They 
are 
still 
an 

important 
tool 
to 
create 

an accurate measure of a 
population for governmental 
policies. So next time you get 
a government survey in the 
mail there’s no need to burn 
it or put on your tinfoil hat. 
Instead, do your research and 
identify how the census is 
taken and which groups are 
likely to be misrepresented. 
Who knows, you may find 
that you too are a victim of 
the census’s vanishing act.

5A — Wednesday, March 7, 2018
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Ypsilanti-born Fred Thomas has 
been making music since 1992. In 
addition to nine solo albums — his 
most recent, Changer, was released 
in Jan. 2017 — he has contributed to 
countless projects and played in a 
myriad of bands, including Tyvek, 
Hydropark, Saturday Looks Good 
To Me and so many others. Though 
a longtime fixture of the local 
scene, Thomas as a solo performer 
didn’t receive widespread attention 
until 2015’s All Are Saved, a 
thematically dense work that spans 
an impressive variety of sounds and 
textures. Thomas’s vocals range 
from absent to sing-song to spoken 
word.
“It’s supposed to be a little bit 
irritating,” Thomas said when I 
asked him about his lyrical style on 
the record.
“I had a lot of songs that were 
more like straightforward pop 
songs, but … I had more going on 
personally that I wasn’t getting 
to the core of, and once I started 
tapping into the style of that record, 
I was like ‘This is great! This feels 
so good! I don’t know if I would 
enjoy listening to this,’” he told 
me, before doing an impression 
of his wife doing an impression of 
his music, a hysterical sputtering 
lacking a discernible melody.
“A guy trying to catch his breath 
while he says everything on his 
mind,” he finished, “and she’s 
right.”
I 
disagree 
with 
Thomas’s 
evaluation of All Are Saved as 
annoying, but his wife’s assessment 
of his sound and the urgency is spot 
on. What I’m curious about, though, 
is what changed for Thomas ahead 
of the album’s release. How and 
why did it receive so much more 
attention than his previous work?
“I’ve tried to answer this 
question concisely before, and I’ve 
failed, so I’m going to try again 
today,” he responded.
Thomas’s answer reflects both 
his lifelong dedication to music and 
his humility. First, he talked about 
how he’s “always playing music. 
One hundred percent of the time, 
I’ve been in at least two bands since 
I was a child.”
By his mid-20s, Thomas had 
seen the greater part of the civilized 
world, spending up to 10 months 
touring each year, but largely just 
went with the flow, musically. 
“Everything that happened before 
All Are Saved was just what I was 
thinking about at the time,” he 
said. By his mid-30s, he reported 
feeling out of place — “Everyone at 
the show or in bands was at least 10 
years younger than me” — but not 
necessarily in a bad way.
“As soon as I started feeling that 
weightlessness of not really having 
to think about everything that 
surrounded (the music) … I just had 
no choice but to tap into what was 
happening to me, and part of what 
was happening to me was that I was 
no longer really concerned with 
getting attention for my record. 
Ironically, that’s when more people 
started paying attention,” he said.
He also mentioned at least 
a couple of unique sources of 
inspiration at the time. He had 
worked as a caretaker for a dog 
— Kuma, which is also the name 
of his 2012 record — who passed 
away, an experience he told me 
“heightened (his) spiritual sense.” 
While he was writing All Are Saved, 
he also “met and fell in love with 
the woman (he’s) now married 
to.” Both certainly contributed to 
the themes of both love, at its most 

awkward and purest, and loss, at its 
most numbingly devastating.
On the same day of our 
conversation, before I walked to 
Roos Roast Coffee, where Thomas 
agreed to meet up, I was going 
through some old things and 
stumbled on the first issue of a 
zine called “Balcony” that Thomas 
started just over a year ago. Seeing 
his post on Instagram in 2017, I had 
messaged mw address and shortly 
thereafter PayPal-ed him for a copy. 
Thomas opens the zine with a piece 
called “Season Three” in which 
he, among other things, belabors 
the virtues and shortcomings of 
“Jersey Shore” and recounts the 
arduous, self-doubt-ridden process 
of choosing a title for the zine. The 
first sentence of the essay reads, 
“Names are difficult.” Naturally, 
then, my last question about All Are 
Saved is regarding its title.
“Wow, speaking of Instagram,” 
he started, “some beautiful times 
were happening and some really 
dark times were happening, and it 
was all kind of happening at once, 
as it often does, and I was going 
through the car wash, having a 
total existential freak-out … I took 
a picture of the car wash bristles 
for Instagram and I titled it, I was 
like, ‘All Are Fucked,’” his voice 
caricatured to accentuate the 
pseudo-edginess of the statement. 
“And it was like ‘no, that’s stupid’… 
I erased it and put ‘All Are Saved’ 
to try to save that moment and 
to try to save myself from the 
negativity that was creeping into 
so much of my life, and it just kind 
of stuck. I was like, ‘Oh, this is a 
beautiful idea.’ Sometimes the most 
beautiful ideas, you feel like you 
didn’t actually have anything to 
do with them, they were just kind 
of broadcast into you, or through 
you.”
If you read an interview or 
piece about Changer, 2017’s follow-
up to All Are Saved, you probably 
also read about its title, about how 
Thomas had gotten married, quit 
his desk job and moved to Montreal. 
What you may not have read is that 
“Changer” is also a reference to a 
song of the same name that Thomas 
wrote for a band he used to play in.
“It was one of the songs we 
wrote early on, and we only played 
it a couple times, but I was like, ‘I 
love that song! … I’m gonna keep it 
in the back of my mind for another 
time.’”
For a man who claims to have a 
difficulty with names, he’s chosen 
some awfully good ones. They 
lack 
presumptuousness 
while 
ringing with personal truth, two 
qualities that seem to lie at the 
core of Thomas’s entire pursuit 
as a musician. “I feel great for 
anyone who can navigate the music 
industry and still retain their sense 
of self,” he told me, earlier during 
the interview, before pausing for 
a moment. Then he continued, 
“That’s my goal. I don’t know if I’ve 
done it.”
Later in our conversation, he 
touched on a similar note when I 
asked him about the responsibility 
of artists to acknowledge the world 
politically and socially.
“I do think that there’s a 
responsibility for people to, if not 
speak from their political heart, to 
just actually speak from who they 
are, and tell the world who they are 
in as honest and straightforward 
terms as possible,” he said. “I do 
firmly believe that the personal is 
the political, and just the bravery in 
even making any song at all about 
how you’re doing and what you’re 
going through is a political act, and 
in that way, I’m trying to do my 
part.”

We talked about Frank Ocean’s 
Blonde — Thomas likened it to 
Pet Sounds in terms of cultural 
importance and called it his 
“hangover record” — in the 
same vein. “Blonde is such a raw, 
beautiful record … and it doesn’t 
feel like anything besides, ‘OK, 
this is my mind, this is where I’m 
at, this is my perspective, which 
is different from anybody else’s 
perspective in the world,’ and I 
think that’s political in itself,” he 
said.
Moving 
forward, 
to 
2017, 
Thomas immediately mentioned 
Mount Eerie’s A Crow Looked At 
Me as one of his favorites “of the 
last many, many years.”
“I listened to it two times on tour 
and I can’t even actually talk about 
it without feeling like I want to cry 
… talk about a unique perspective, 
and a heart-ripping one. I can’t 
even imagine,” he trailed off, and 
I interjected with my memory of 
Mount Eerie’s performance at a 
festival called Waking Windows 
in Detroit this past summer. 
The venue’s manager had flown 
Elverum in from Oregon to play 
his songs for one 
night only. The 
crowd wound up 
just about knee-
deep 
in 
their 
own tears.
“I don’t know 
how he could do 
it. I sometimes 
cry when I play 
because 
my 
songs are very 
personal 
and 
important 
to 
me. I can’t even 
get through that 
record 
without 
wanting to call everyone I’ve ever 
loved and apologize … The gift that 
is our very, very short time on this 
planet is completely — the point 
is driven home with that record,” 
Thomas said.
On to 2018 and Thomas told 
me his forthcoming record will 
be here in October. “It’s so very 
very different,” he told me. “I have 
nothing but happiness and joy to 
report, but my record is super sad.” 
Where much of the triumph and 
sorrow alike on All Are Saved was 
sourced from Thomas’s personal 
life, it sounds like this new album 
will offer a reaction to the 2016 U.S. 
election and the proceedings since 
then, though he was an observer 
abroad while it all unfolded.
He summed up his feelings on 
the matter with a pithy anecdote: 
“At a certain point into the Trump 
era, I was like, ‘Oh yeah, I haven’t 
listened to Belle and Sebastian in 
a minute.’ Because it feels almost 
irresponsible to have happiness or 
be care-free.”
And if it feels irresponsible 
to listen to music that doesn’t 
in some way reflect the current 
state of affairs, then Thomas 
must have something to say about 
making music that doesn’t seem to 
acknowledge reality.
“I need to know what we can do 
to swing the pendulum back to at 
least where we feel less suicidal … 
I feel like all my time, from when I 
wake up to when I sleep, I have to 
be doing something to fight against 
the legalization of oppression of 
anybody who doesn’t fall into a 
strict red-state blueprint. So that’s 
kinda the vibe of my record,” he 
said.
Throughout our conversation, 
Thomas 
demonstrated 
an 
impressive awareness of himself 
and the world around him. Maybe 
it’s this hyper-awareness that 
comes through in his music as

the irritating quality he identified 
earlier. It’s surely responsible for 
the sense of “a guy trying to catch 
his breath while he says everything 
on his mind,” evidenced not only 
by the pace of his lyrical delivery, 
but by the content. For people who 

like tracking along with an album’s 
lyrics as they listen, Thomas’s 
catalog is a goldmine. He deftly 
weaves personal anecdotes with 
newly discovered universal truths 
in a way that feels not effortless, but 
ineffably natural. Despite his poetic 

prowess, though, Thomas will be 
the first to tell you that he’s only 
human, and he’ll tell you whether 
you ask or not. Thomas won’t ask 
for your attention, but you should 
give it to him anyway — not for his 
sake, but for yours.

Ought with Snail 
Mail & Fred Thomas

Museum of 
Contemporary Art in 
Detroit

Thursday @ 8 p.m.

$12.50 - $15.00

In 2011, four individuals living 
in Montreal formed the post-
punk band Ought, releasing their 
debut EP, New Calm, a year later. 
In the time that followed, Ought 
released their first full-length 
and began touring. The relatively 
small band that popped into 
attention following the Quebec 
student protests in 2012 became 
internationally known.
Last Wed., The Daily was able 
to speak with lead vocalist Tim 
Darcy about Ought’s new record, 
Room Inside the World and their 
highly anticipated show with 
accompanying 
artists 
Snail 
Mail and Fred 
Thomas at the 
Museum 
of 
Contemporary 
Art in Detroit.
The Michigan 
Daily: How do 
you feel (Room 
Inside the World) 
is different from 
any of your past 
records, 
and, 
just in general, 
how do you feel 
you’ve 
grown 
as a band since that first EP you 
released, Once More With Feeling?
Darcy: Well, I think parts of 
this record … we were much more 
intentional with it than we have 
ever been as a band. Even writing 
More Than Any Other Day, our 
first full-length, we were just kids 
in Montreal. We would play when 
we had time, once maybe twice a 
week, and play shows and would 
write one new song and play that 
at the show. So the process was 
really drawn-out and there was no 
real time constraint on it because 
we didn’t immediately have any 
end goals besides recording and 
that sort of thing. Then we slowly 
started building up organically, 
like first set recording an EP in 
our house and then doing it in a 
friend’s studio and then just kind 
of the natural way that that goes. 
Even with those, we had all been in 
other bands before so we brought 
a lot of those into the process of 
making that EP, but there was a 
lot of experimenting and figuring 
out what would suit the song and 
then there was a second record. 
We toured the first record so hard 
that when we got back … it wasn’t 
like an imperative but we had a 
three month window where we all 
had to learn French if we wanted 
to stay in Canada. And at the same 
time, we also were writing a new 
record so we were like taking 
night classes, writing during 
the day and we just finished the 
album and then the next day, went 
on tour again basically for another 
year. So, for this record we really 
wanted to move more slowly and 
also communication was a big part 
of it. In the months leading up to 
writing when we were back from 
tour, we just sent around a lot of 
music and little ideas. We made 
this kind of digital mood board 
and uploaded photos and visual 
art that we liked as well as songs, 

or we’d upload a whole record that 
sounds nothing like us but is fun. 
We’d say, “Oh I’ve been listening 
to this a lot, everybody check it 
out.” That part was really fruitful 
for us to wade into each other’s 
subconscious. So, in that way, this 
record, I think, builds some songs, 
builds upon things that we were 
doing on the other records and 
I think do them in the most full 
and fleshed out way that we’ve 
done yet. And then there are other 
things that are completely new 
and that’s exciting for us to get to 
bring that in on our third record.
TMD: So what sort of music 
were you all passing around 
during the weeks leading up to the 
writing of this album?
Darcy: It’s really broad. We 
all really like ambient music, 
instrumental music — we talked 
a lot about synths, particular 
synth sounds because that was 
something Matt (May) wanted 
to experiment more with. We 
wanted to think about textures 
that could kind of add extra layers 
of paint without it necessarily 
being a distortion. But we also 
didn’t want to make an ’80s 
sounding record. We were very 
particular with those sounds and 
ended up looking at particular 
people like Brian Eno, obviously, 
and also this artist, Amanaz who 
has a record called Africa. It has 
some really nice, kind of kinky 
synth sounds on it. It was very 
much in keeping with us in that 
we have such a broad array of taste 
and we always have and to bring 
those things together, it’s always a 
mysterious cocktail.
TMD: You talked a lot about 
experimenting 
during 
the 
band’s formation and even now, 
writing this album, there’s a lot 
of experimenting with different 
kinds of music and different kinds 
of sounds. How do you feel like 
growing up in Montreal, which so 
many people have described as a 
Mecca for art and up-and-coming 
artists, has impacted your band 
and your sound?
Darcy: Just the city in of itself 
has such an aura to it. There are 
very material things like rent is 
pretty cheap and, compared to 
other big North American cities, 
it’s fairly easy to find a practice 
space that you can afford and 
there’s a pretty good network of 
venues. It’s not overwhelming. 
I think coming in doesn’t take 
that long to acclimate, which 
is also another bonus. It’s just 
kind of a perfect size in that it’s 
really fertile and there’s new 
stuff coming in but it’s also not 
so sprawling that you kind of 
don’t even know where to start. 
So in that way it’s really like the 
physical, tangible elements were 
really good for us, starting out. 
Interacting with such a wide array 
of music, and I remember there’s a 
Merrill Garbus, from Tune-Yards, 
quote, and I don’t know if it’s 
written down, but I saw her do a 
symposium in Montreal a couple 
years ago and she was talking 
about how in Montreal she felt 
like no one would be surprised or 
judgmental and she could just be 
weird on stage. It is hard to shock 
a Montreal audience, which is 

great and I think in some ways we 
… I mean we definitely rank low 
on the shocking spectrum as far 
as things I’ve seen in Montreal, 
but it’s a good environment to 
not get caught up in being self-
conscious or being so caught up 
in what is specifically on-trend at 
this particular moment. I think 
that generates a lot of liberating 
expressions. And obviously, you 
know, there’s no perfect place. The 
winters are obviously horrible. A 
lot of people are really broke. But 
Montreal is definitely in the fabric 
of all three records that we’ve 
made.
TMD: I find that your music, 
when I listen to it, it’s very easy for 
me to connect to it. The lyricism, 
especially, just seems to embrace 
the mundane details of life, 
even though your sound itself is 
very broad, as you’ve described. 
This sense of connectability, 
is this something that you try 
to purposefully convey or is it 
something that appears more 
naturally and organically as you 
all are creating these different 
albums?
Darcy: A big part of the 
“Ought-style,” 
which 
we 
all 
kind of witnessed forming over 
several records as we looked 
back, especially working on this 
record, because we were more 
intentionally 
trying 
out 
new 
things, we would get to the end 
of a song and be like, ‘Oh there 
that is, that thing that we do.’ 
One of those things is that we 
definitely combine hooks and 
more accessible rock tropes with 
things that kind of break those 
open and ideally rejuvenate that 
thing and make you think twice 
about it. That’s just been part of 
how the four of us think about 
songs like that. As far as lyricism 
goes, I think about the lyrics 
very distinctly from the music 
sometimes. It really varies by 
song. There are some songs where 
it’s much more about the melody… 
but then there are definitely other 
songs where I’m really focused 
on the lyrics. The writers that I 
like have the kind of clarity that 
you’re talking about. “Clarity” is 
the word I like to use because it’s 
not about simplicity. I really love 
writing that is adventurous. If I 
don’t feel like something is coming 
across, it loses me even if they’re 
turning a nice phrase. I need to 
feel like I’m getting something 
from it, which maybe sounds 
obvious, but focusing on little 
things, that comes very naturally 
to me because it’s very much in the 
things that I like to read.
TMD: What are some of those 
writers that have inspired you?
Darcy: So many. I read a ton. 
I think Joan Didion’s a great 
example. The way that she visits 
very iconic and major archetypes 
in the American psyche, John 
Wayne and I’m reading the 
essay on Haight-Ashbury in San 
Francisco now. She witnesses 
these things and doesn’t draw any 
conclusions. I found that a lot of 
the great thinkers are people who 
are willing to kind of live with the 
questions and sort of see things 
and kind of chew on them a bit but 
not be like, “This is what this is.”

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

I wish the Oscars were better. 
I wish there was a platform to 
properly acknowledge the look 
Laurie Metcalf gives in “Lady 
Bird” when Danny says, “There 
are actual train tracks.” And I wish 
had a microphone loud enough so 
everyone in the world could hear 
me yell, “Timmy was robbed!”
I wish, even more, that they 
didn’t matter to me. I wish I didn’t 
feel crushed watching “The Shape 
of Water” win Best Picture when I 
know the movies my children will 
still be watching (granting TVs 
and the Earth still exist) are “Lady 
Bird” and “Get Out.”
I’m mad that a TV event where 
off-screen white men give awards 
to their peers doesn’t adhere to 
my idea of justice. I can see the 
absurdity there. But the Academy 
proved itself — even when it 
wasn’t giving out statues — to 
be completely out of touch with 
the industry it is supposed to 
represent.
There were a hundred or so 
times during my Oscar watch 
party when the eyes in the room 
shifted to me. Any reference 
to “Lady Bird,” when someone 
thought they saw Adam Driver and 
when George Romero appeared in 
the In Memoriam segment. We 
sighed for Romero and Jonathan 
Demme and Harry Dean Stanton. 
And then it was over.
Now, I have a few issues with 
this part of the night. First of all: 
Eddie Vedder? Was literally no 
one else available? And secondly, 
the list of omissions that just about 
outnumbered the inclusions. The 
most jarring of which, at least for 
me, was Tobe Hooper.
I had to go back and check 
that Hooper actually died last 
year — he did — because I could 
not believe the Academy would 
do something that stupid. (That 
was supposed to be a joke! The 
Academy voters are morons in a 
deeper sense). Hooper belongs 
in the pantheon with Romero 
and 
Craven. 
Hooper 
wrote 
the visual terms for American 
horror, defined it as something 
indefinable.

The real irony is that “Texas 
Chainsaw 
Massacre”’s 
iconic 
shot was included in the “magic 
of the movies” tribute supercut. 
Leatherface 
swinging 
his 
chainsaw through the air against 
that brilliant Texas sunrise — in 
isolation, it could be mistaken for 
a still from “Days of Heaven.” It 
is emblematic of the humor and 
beauty the permeate a Hooper 
low-budget gore-fest.
The Academy can, at least, 

recognize it as one of the most 
important images in the American 
film canon. But they can’t be 
bothered to recognize the person 
responsible for creating it.
They made the same kinds 
of moves the entire night. The 
Academy can nominate outside 
their comfort zone, but they’re 
still giving out awards like it’s 
2016. With a few exceptions — 
Jordan 
Peele’s 
screenwriting 
win and “Phantom Thread”’s 
costumes were the few signs of 
the “justice” I mentioned earlier 
— the show played out the way I 
dreaded it would.
Maybe I’m fixating on the 
Hooper omission, but I really do 
think it points to the core of the 
Academy’s issue. Beyond their 
whiteness and their maleness and 
their oldness (all factors which 
illuminate the point I’m about 
to make next), it’s their genre-
aversion.
People on Twitter will be 
quick to tell you (and me) that 

“The Shape of Water” is a horror 
film. It’s not. We’ve seen del Toro 
make horror. This is dark fantasy 
at best. This is the kind of movie 
that people who have never seen a 
horror movie call prestige horror.
Genre films got nominated. 
“Get Out” is horror. “Lady Bird” 
and “Call Me By Your Name” 
are 
coming 
of 
age 
movies. 
“Phantom Thread” is on the more 
bizarre end, but it’s still on the 
spectrum of serious period pieces 
(“Dunkirk,” “The Post,” “Darkest 
Hour”) that the Academy goes 
crazy for. I don’t even want to 
mention “Three Billboards,” but 
I will say dark comedy about the 
soul of America is well within the 
Academy’s comfort zone.
Our three true genre films 
illuminate the ways in which the 
stories of marginalized groups — 
people of color, women, the LGBT 
community — are not served 
by the methods of storytelling 
traditionally 
recognized 
by 
institutions like the Academy. 
To have a genre problem is to 
have a diversity problem, and 
the comparison between the 
winners and the nominees only 
underscores this point.
So the problem is bigger 
than leaving Tobe Hooper off 
a slideshow. But it’s moments 
like 
that, 
when 
we’re 
not 
watching with the same critical 
eye we watch the Best Picture 
announcement, that the Academy 
shows its cards.
Two years ago, they would’ve 
picked “Darkest Hour” — I feel 
very comfortable betting a large 
amount of money on that. With 
“Moonlight,” we moved in the 
right direction, and with “The 
Shape of Water,” I don’t know 
where exactly we moved, but we 
did. So there’s hope.
The Academy is out of touch 
and the whole model of award 
shows probably is as well. But 
until I have the clout to mail 
Laurie Metcalf an award and 
have it mean something, I know 
what to expect from the Academy 
Awards. Justice (my picture of 
justice, at least) will not be served.

The Academy voters are 
morons in a deeper sense

DAILY FILM COLUMN

MADELEINE 
GAUDIN

The art of humor in film is 
certainly difficult to master. It is 
difficult to find a balance between 
comic relief and overusing the 
same 
punchlines 
and 
quips. 
Even the funniest moments of 
a film can be ruined through 
repetition. The exhaustion of 
a joke can turn what was once 
found hilarious by audiences 
into something lackluster and 
irritating, resulting in boredom. 
In securing a few audience laughs 
at the beginning of the film, 
“Game Night” falsely presumes 
that it has viewers hooked, and 
thus proceeds to squeeze every 
last drop of humor from the 
jokes from the first quarter of 
the film until there is absolutely 
no comedy left. Though the 
film initially manages to grasp 
audience 
attention, 
its 
hold 
quickly 
loosens 
through 
its 
unchecked overeagerness to push 
humor at viewers, resulting in the 
unraveling of plot direction and 
an unclear tone. 
At the start of the film, 
viewers are greeted by a cutesy 
montage, 
documenting 
the 
game-themed 
relationship 
of 
quirky, competitive couple Max 
(Jason Bateman, “Zootopia”) and 
Annie (Rachel McAdams, “The 
Notebook”), who are known and 
beloved by their friends for their 
frequent hosting of game nights. 
Trouble arises, however, when 
Max’s charismatic yet sketchy 
brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler, 

“Super 8”) comes to town and 
hosts his own game night, 
one that he brags will surpass 
all others by involving a faux 
kidnapping of one of the players 
and an evening of detective work 
to find them. However, the night 
rapidly spirals out of control, 
launching the group of suburban, 
millennial players into a night of 
real danger, hazard and chaos. 
Despite a plotline that sounds 
somewhat promising, this film is 
a mess. Essential to the movie’s 

foundering is that it becomes 
way too complicated way too fast. 
Characters and viewers alike are 
jerked back and forth, taunted by 
directors John Francis Daley and 
Jonathan Goldstein (“Vacation”) 
into believing that something is 
just part of the game one minute 
and that it is real the next. The 
lack of clarity over what is going 
on does not create the desired 
effect of mystery and suspense, 
but instead prompts frustration 
and annoyance among viewers 
over the faulty direction of the 
plot. 
The 
only 
praiseworthy 
element of the film is the 
chemistry 
between 
Bateman 
and 
McAdams’s 
characters. 
Throughout the film, Max and 
Annie function as more of a 
unit than individuals, working 

in tandem as a harmonious 
dynamic duo. To the film’s credit, 
the scenes with the two are quite 
charming and audiences are able 
to find a relatively stable source 
of humor from their married 
couple banter. Yet, not even the 
charming compatibility between 
Max and Annie can save this film.
Overall, Daley and Goldstein’s 
aim to create a film that is fast-
paced 
and 
engaging 
falters, 
instead leaving audiences too 
confused 
and 
whiplashed 
to 
laugh. 
The 
sense 
of 
discombobulation felt when the 
theater lights came up speaks 
to the severe lack of clarity as 
to what exactly the film wanted 
to accomplish in the first place. 
Mostly to blame is the imbalanced 
combination of sinister and silly 
moments that end up generating 
an all-encompassing sense of 
awkwardness, especially evident 
through the presence of Gary, 
Annie and Max’s overly creepy 
next-door neighbor whose weird, 
almost psychopathic manner is 
used to elicit comedic effect in 
one moment and fear in the next. 
Gary’s character is reflective of 
the film as a whole: intended to 
create intrigue through a bizarre 
and ill-made blend of eerie and 
comical, but instead provoking 
audience members into a state 
of confusion and uninterest. 
Although “Game Night” unfolds 
within the short span of one, 
fateful evening, inconsistencies 
in the direction and mood of 
the storyline ultimately make 
the film feel like an unpleasant 
eternity. 

Bateman and McAdams 
can’t save ‘Game Night’

“Game Night”

Analicia 
Sotelo’s 
debut 
collection of poems, “Virgin,” 
the winner of the inaugural 
Jake Adam York Prize, offers 
a prismatic glimpse into the 
author’s personal experiences 
as 
a 
Mexican-American 
woman. 
The 
poems 
are 
iridescent — at times showing a 
detached critique of femininity, 
heterosexual 
relationships 
or both; at others, viscerally 
personal memories.
Lines 
that 
should 
be 
reminiscent 
of 
things 
like 
curtains and frothy champagne 
— “The moon points out my 
neckline like a chaperone,” 
she writes, in the first poem 
titled “Do You Speak Virgin?” 
— take on a keener edge in this 
collection, as she takes on the 
minutiae of societal poisoning 
of love and sex. “South Texas 
Persephone” ends with the 
speaker 
declaring 
“Now 
I 
have three heads: one / for 
speech, one for sex, / and 
one for second-guessing,” a 
triangulation 
which 
neatly 
encapsulates much of the rest 
of the volume.
Much 
of 
the 
first 
half 

of 
“Virgin” 
reveals 
an 
exasperation 
of 
watching 
people 
perform 
their 
relationships, 
hastening 
to 
use the first person plural 
as if it means something, 
clutching on to banalities like 
they’re lifelines. “We’re all 
performing our bruises,” she 
says in “Private Property,” 

and this sentiment is carried 
throughout.
The 
intensity 
of 
the 
collection 
is 
perhaps 
most 
vibrant when she captures the 
simultaneity of numbness and 
pain that comes from holding 
your tongue, mostly visible in 
the poems about her parents 
and in those about being close 
to our creations, like “I’m 
Trying to Write a Poem about 
a Virgin and It’s Awful.” Yet 
humor doesn’t take a backseat 
to potency; sincere words are 
often brushed over with irony 
— or at least an ambiguity 
addressed with an eye roll: 
“many people are tender from 

the right angle. / I’m hungry 
& confused. I love / a good 
barbecue. Save me.”
While some of the poems feel 
like puzzles that include more 
than a couple extra pieces, most 
are taut; The words slice to the 
core of her message. She writes 
of loving men — significantly 
older men, white men — as a 
traumatic 
experience. 
And 
she writes about her parents’ 
relationship. 
But 
she 
also 
warns against making the tired 
assumption, in a sly, if cutting, 
aside to the reader: “You may 
wish to make some connection 
/ between father and lover 
here, as if your joke / could 
really be my life’s solution, or 
as if / I haven’t already done 
that, in a cuter way.”
In the latter half of the 
collection, 
Sotelo 
breathes 
new life into old Greek myths, 
giving 
perspectives 
that 
readers might not ever have 
considered 
otherwise. 
The 
most haunting of the set is 
“Ariadne Discusses Theseus 
in Relation to the Minotaur,” 
which 
leaves 
readers 
with 
the image of both Sotelo and 
Ariadne standing alone, man 
and monster gone, nothing but 
a lack of thread and answers in 
their outstretched hands.

‘Virgin’ is vibrant, potent

After tournament championship, ‘M’ approaches uncommon off week

So now what?
After claiming the Big Ten 

Tournament 
Championship 

for a second year in a row, the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team is riding high. It vaulted to 
No. 7 in the AP poll released on 
Monday, and continues to climb 
up bracket projections, now 
seemingly locked into a top-
four seed — bracketmatrix.com, 
a website that compiles a host of 
predictions, has the Wolverines 
as the final No. 3 seed.

Michigan 
has 
won 
nine 

games in a row, and after 
beating 
Nebraska 
in 
the 

quarterfinal and Purdue in the 
final, has beaten all of the other 
13 Big Ten teams, the only team 
in the conference to accomplish 
that feat this season. Suddenly, 
a pesky, middling Big Ten team 
has become one of the hottest 
in the country, and a bonafide 
contender.

But 
after 
winning 
four 

games in four days, the red-hot 
Wolverines will go at least 10 
days before playing next.

Thanks 
to 
a 
condensed 

schedule 
created 
to 

accommodate Madison Square 
Garden as the venue for last 
week’s tournament, Michigan 

won’t find out who it’s playing or 
where it’s going for another five 
days, raising the interminable 
question of rest versus rust.

After 
a 
dizzying 
week, 

Michigan coach 
John 
Beilein 

made his case 
for rest.

“I’ve 
been 

here before with 
both 
Canisius 

and Richmond,” 
Beilein 
said. 

“You’ve got to 
pace 
yourself, 

and you’ve got to 
embrace it, say, 
‘You know what, we’ve got time 
to get better now.’ We’re going 
to get better.

“I think it’ll be a nice week 

where I’m not — we just 
prepared for five teams in four 
days. I’m looking forward (to 
the fact) we can’t prepare for 
the next opponent, we can just 
focus on ourselves the next 
week.”

Not only does Beilein have 

experience with the prolonged 
time off, he actually has success.

In 1998, Beilein’s 14th-seeded 

Richmond team upset the No. 3 
seeded South Carolina coming 
off a similar 11-day layoff.

Beilein noted that he won’t 

practice each day, but would 

likely practice a couple times 
with an intra-squad scrimmage 
slated for Sunday afternoon 
prior to the announcement of 
the NCAA Tournament field. 

When 
asked 

what his team 
can 
improve 

upon 
before 

the start of the 
Tournament, 
Beilein 
eagerly 

responded, 
“Oh, 
man,” 

before 
naming 

off 
a 
laundry 

list of areas for 
improvment. 

Free-throw shooting, boxing 
out and on-ball defense all made 
the cut before he forced himself 
to slow down and acknowledge 
the need to take things easy.

But the perils of rust loom 

large for a team now gelling as 
one of the nation’s best. 

There was no feeling of 

disappointment in the Michigan 
locker room about getting the 
extra week — or at least no 
outward admission of such. If 
anything, the attitude was a 
workmanlike ambivalence.

“I think we are just going 

to focus on — first of all, we’re 
going to enjoy this a couple 
days and to get some rest,” 
said 
junior 
center 
Moritz 

Wagner, the tournament’s Most 
Outstanding Player. “Then we’re 
going to focus on what’s next. 
Whether that’s an advantage 
or disadvantage, doesn’t really 
matter.”

Added 

Robinson: 
“We’re 
just 

looking at it as, 
it is what it is. 
It’ll be nice to 
get some rest — 
don’t have the 
young legs like I 
once did, being a 
fifth-year senior. 
It’ll be nice to get 
off my feet for it.”

Senior guard Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman said he likes 

to play Xbox during his down 
time, 
specifically 
Fortnite 

and Call of Duty. Robinson 
remarked 
that 
each 
player 

would 
maximize 
the 
extra 

week to watch 
more film, get 
an extra weight 
lift in or simply 
catch up on rest.

But it’s only 

human 
nature 

to 
think 
the 

streaking 
Wolverines 
would just want 
to keep playing 
basketball. 

On Sunday, the rest of the 

conference tournaments will 
come to a close and the bracket 

will be released. Beilein will 
begin his game preparation, and 
the most chaotic sporting event 
in the country will officially 
begin.

And no matter what happens 

in the next month, no matter 
what 
seed 
Michigan 
will 

end with, no matter what — 
if anything — comes of this 
uncommon 
week 
off, 
the 

Wolverines will still hang a 
banner in Crisler Center come 
next season.

Careful not to fret too much 

about the extra time, Beilein 
made one thing clear about the 
schedule after he celebrated 
his second straight Big Ten 
Tournament title.

“It was worth it.”

“I’ve been here 

before with 
Canisius and 
Richmond.”

“We’re going 
to enjoy this a 
couple days and 
get some rest.”

Boka working to control his emotions when the Wolverines need it most

On Jan. 7 against then-No. 1 

Notre Dame in South Bend, the 
Michigan hockey team skated 
off the ice with heads hanging 
low after 40 minutes of play. 
The Wolverines allowed two 
unanswered goals in the second 
period and found themselves 
down, 2-0, heading into the third.

As Michigan made its way down 

the tunnel, defenseman Nicholas 
Boka slammed his stick into the 
ground and let out an expletive 
so loud it echoed throughout 
Compton Family Ice Arena.

Known 
for 
wearing 
his 

emotions on his sleeves, the 
junior let everyone know the 
dejected state of the Wolverines. 
Michigan would go on to lose, 
2-1, sending it to a dismal 8-10-2 
record — a continuation of last 
year’s disappointment — with 
little hope for NCAA Tournament 
contention.

Almost two months later, Boka 

— always the last player to exit 
the pregame skate — left the Yost 
Ice Arena rink all smiles. As fans 
piled in for a Big Ten Tournament 
quarterfinal 
matchup 
against 

Wisconsin last Saturday, the 
blueliner would again be the 
telltale sign of an upbeat dressing 
room.

Riding a nation’s-best seven-

game 
unbeaten 
streak, 
the 

Wolverines were only one win 
away from sweeping the Badgers 
and advancing to the Big Ten 
Tournament semifinals for a 
rivalry showdown against Ohio 
State. They’d proceed to a 7-4 
victory and are all but guaranteed 
an NCAA Tournament berth in 
upcoming weeks.

Following 
Saturday’s 
win, 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
was quick to applaud Boka, 
who 
assisted 
on 
sophomore 

defenseman Griffin Luce’s goal 
to put the Wolverines up, 6-3, 
early in the third period. The 
helper added to Boka’s plus-15 
rating, best among the Wolverine 
defensemen.

“Nick’s been really good the 

second half, and good for him,” 
Pearson said. “He had a lot of ice 
time tonight and gives us another 
strong defenseman. I like our 
defense. Even though we gave up 
a lot of goals this weekend, I like a 
lot of things about them.”

What evolution in Boka’s game 

has led to this major improvement 
down the stretch?

“Emotional control,” Pearson 

said, without skipping a beat, 
after practice Tuesday. “I think 
he’s not getting wrapped up in a 
lot of things that’s gone on in the 
games. He’s now worried about 
what he needs to do to be a good 
player and help the team.

“The thing with Nick is he’s 

very 
competitive. 
… 
We’ve 

just had to have him dial in 
emotionally and manage the 
game emotionally. He’s always 
had good skills when it comes to 
skating and puck handling, he 

just gets a little out of sorts. We 
said to him, ‘Just play the game.’ ”

Through 
many 
one-on-one 

conversations, 
Pearson 
has 

reigned in Boka’s temperament, 
encouraging 
tough 
and 

physical 
play 
without 

committing 
avoidable 
penalties.

And 
it’s 

translated to his 
on-ice success.

After 10 games 

without a point, 
Boka 
registered 

two assists in his last three games. 
He’s blocked 42 shots this season 
and continues to limit turnovers 
in the defensive zone. His game 
has strengthened in proportion 
to his disposition, resulting in 
increased trust from Pearson.

In Saturday’s contest, Boka 

played more minutes than most 
blueliners, despite practicing only 
once the prior week and missing 
Friday’s game due to an upper-
body injury sustained during the 

regular 
season 

finale 
against 

Arizona State.

Even 
with 

a 
lineup 
that 

has 
regularly 

changed 
throughout 
the 

season based on 
game and practice 
performance, 
Boka, if healthy, 
was 
virtually 

guaranteed to lace up his skates 
against Wisconsin and receive 
substantial ice time.

“He’s put money in the bank,” 

Pearson said. “He’s made some 
good deposits over the course of 
the year, so when he came in to 
withdraw, he had some money 

in there. That’s how you look at 
it. He’s played well. This time of 
year, sometimes when you miss 
practice it’s no big deal. He’s a 
good skater, so he doesn’t get too 
far behind.”

But Boka didn’t take that for 

granted, quickly getting back to 
full strength for Saturday’s game.

“It was tough watching the 

game Friday from the stands,” 
Boka said. “Throughout the week, 
it was just doing rehab to get back 
in the lineup. I hate watching, and 
I want to do my best to help the 
team.”

The Plymouth, Mich. native 

credits 
his 
teammates 
and 

newfound emotional restraint as 
reasons for his recent advances.

“I think when the team plays 

well, it makes it easier to do your 
job,” Boka said. “… It makes it 
easier on me to focus on my role 
and shut down other teams, and 
it’s been working for me.

“I also think it’s just being 

aware of my emotions. Hockey is a 
pretty emotional game, and there’s 
going to be ups and downs, but you 
just have to kind of prepare for 
that aspect. … Once I start talking, 
it gets my emotions going. I try 
to stay away from it and talk to 
my teammates instead of other 
teams. And it’s definitely helped 
in keeping my emotions in check.”

Added Luce, Boka’s defensive 

partner for most of the season: 
“He’s an emotional guy and … 
I know he likes to stir things 
up. But the chemistry between 
us is great, so if I’m getting too 
emotional, he’ll give me a pat on 
the back, say ‘Hey, relax,’ and I 
think the same goes for him. I 
think we’re on that level with 
each other where we can take 
each other down or bring each 
other up if we need to.”

But have no fear, Boka is still 

the same passionate — and vocal 
— leader he’s always been.

He still jaws with opponents 

and partakes in extracurricular 
activity after the whistle. In the 
first game of the Sun Devils’ series, 
Boka faced a standoff against 
defenseman Jakob Stridsberg.

As always, after pregame skate, 

Boka waited for Arizona State to 
get off the ice and go to its locker 
room before he did. Stridsberg 
decided to wait, too.

It 
took 
some 
referee 

intervention, but Boka got the 
best of Stridsberg. He was the last 
one to leave his home ice.

Boka still holds the same 

approach 
in 
deciding 
which 

players he goes after — go for 
those who are easily unnerved 
and stay away from those who 
would go unfazed.

And he’s still the player Pearson 

believes is one of the best trash 
talkers in all of college hockey.

As the postseason rolls on 

and the Wolverines look to more 
good fortune, No. 74 in the maize 
sweater will be a key force on the 
backline. Not just as his bruiser 
reputation proceeds him, but as a 
vital cog in the Michigan engine 
on both sides of the ice.

A look inside Michigan’s lifting program with strength coach Jamie Priess

We see Michigan women’s 

basketball 
players 
knocking 

down shots, grabbing boards 
and drawing up plays. But the 
fans rarely get to witness the 
preparation that goes into the 
final spectacle. They don’t know 
about the daily lives consumed 
with practice, game planning 
and watching film.

People rarely think about the 

countless hours in the gym, and 
they certainly don’t consider 
how much time athletes spend 
in the weight room.

To establish a firmer grasp 

on the Wolverines’ strength 
and conditioning program, The 
Michigan Daily sat down with 
Jamie Preiss. This past summer, 
Preiss was named Michigan’s 
strength and conditioning coach 
after spending time with the 
wrestling, men’s gymnastics, 
men’s tennis, men’s lacrosse 
and volleyball teams. He also 
currently works with the men’s 
basketball program as well as 
men’s and women’s golf.

Take an inside look at how 

the 
self-proclaimed 
“hardest 

working 
team 
in 
America” 

prepares.

How 
strength 
and 

conditioning 
changes 

throughout the year:

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

Throughout the year I’m sure 
the types of workouts you run 
the team through differ. So how 
do the workouts change from 
the offseason to in-season?

Jamie Preiss: Really it all 

kind of starts in the summer. 
So they go home and come back 
in June. We’ll do our testing 
and evals for a week, and then 
we spend all of July up until 
August training, and then we’ll 
test them again. So July through 
August we’re doing as much 
work as we can. We’re trying 
to get as strong as we can, and 
we’re trying to get in the best 
possible shape as we can.

TMD: So when you say 

“training,” 
specifically 
what 

kind of training do they go 
through?

JP: We do a lot of our main 

lifts like our power cleans, 
squat, bench and a lot of circuit 
training. We’ll do things like 
sled pushes, we’ll get the battle 
ropes out. I’ll also mix in some 
cardio – like some Airdyne 
workouts, (and) conditioning 
on the court, we’ll do basketball 
specific drills for agility and 
start and stop sort of things. 
We also do straight endurance, 
getting up and down the court 
as many times as 
we can.

TMD: 
To 

clarify, 
this 

is 
during 
the 

summer?

JP: 
Yeah, 

during 
the 

summer. 
We’ll 

go three times 
a week in the 
weight 
room 

– 
Monday, 

Wednesday (and) Friday. They 
aren’t on the court a lot, so I 
get a lot of time with them. The 
workouts are an hour to an hour 
and a half.

We usually reserve one day 

a week – usually on Fridays – 
where it’s full-on intensity. We 
work as hard as we can. We do 
team-oriented circuits where 
whatever team finishes first 
wins – it’s competitive. We 
want to try and keep things 
competitive in here and get 
them working as hard as they 
can.

TMD: That fits with the 

motto of the team.

JP: Yeah, their motto is 

the “hardest working team in 
America.” So we try and come 
in every single day in that 
offseason and work as hard as 
we can (in the weight room) 
because they don’t really need 
to work on basketball.

TMD: How does that change 

when the summer ends?

JP: Once you get into the fall, 

once they start playing more 
basketball, we kind of slow it 
down a little bit.

TMD: How often are they 

getting into the weight room 
once basketball picks up?

JP: We might get in (the 

weight room) three times a 
week in the fall, but it’s our 
general lifts — our squat, our 
bench, our power cleans. We 

might do a couple supersets. I’m 
not really crushing them. We 
want to try and keep them fresh 
for practice.

TMD: How does that change 

once the season starts?

JP: It depends on what kind 

of minutes they’re playing. A 
high-minute 
player, 
they’re 

going to lift once 
a week. We’re 
going to get our 
squat, bench and 
power clean out 
of the way early 
on in the week, 
and the next day 
is 
a 
recovery 

day. 
They’re 

stretching 
and 

foam 
rolling. 

We’ll do rehab 
kind of stuff with stretching and 
mobility.

TMD: 
And 
what 
about 

players that don’t see as much 
playing time?

JP: If they’re not playing a ton 

of minutes, we’ll do a little bit 
more lifting. Two days a week 
(of lifting) in season. And (how 
much you do) depends on what 
kind of player you are and where 
you’re at in your development.

TMD: In basketball, what 

lifts 
translate 
to 
the most 

success on the court?

JP: Definitely being able to 

squat, being able to put force 
into the ground. That allows you 
to jump higher. Having good 
leg strength (is important), so 
squatting, deadlifting, power 

cleans. Anything 
that will improve 
your lower body 
strength.

TMD: 
And 

what 
does 
an 

“active rest day” 
consist of?

JP: It’s like 

coming in and 
doing 
some 

mobility 
drills. 

I might do some 

dumbbell work with them, some 
foam rolling, balance drills and 
things like that. They do stuff in 
the training room. Making sure 
they’re doing something to get 
some blood flow.

Catering to different style 

players and different body 
types:

TMD: So how do workouts 

change 
between 
players? 
A 

player like Hallie Thome (6’5”) 
surely has a different workout 
plan than Katelynn Flaherty 
(5’7”).

JP: In season, the high-

minute 
players 

pretty much do 
the same thing. 
They do their day 
one lifts at the 
beginning of the 
week — squat, 
bench, 
power 

clean — and then 
it’s basically like, 
let’s keep them 
healthy.

Out of season, 

it depends on what each player 
needs to work on. Like Hallie 
Thome really needs to do a good 
job getting her legs stronger. Her 
squat numbers were equivalent 
to girls that were guards or much 
smaller than her. So we focused 
on getting her lower body strong 
and she bought in. She went up 
40 pounds in her back squat in 
six weeks of training over the 
summer. Her power clean went 
up 15 pounds too.

With Katelynn, it was more 

about just keeping her healthy, 
and she needed to build up her 
core strength because she was 
having some issues with her 
lower back in the summer.

For 
conditioning, 
each 

position group’s workout is 
a little different. But in the 
weight room, it’s really based 
on their individual needs. And I 
evaluate them in the summer to 
determine what they need.

On who excels:
TMD: Is there anyone that 

stands out in the weight room?

JP: Jillian (Dunston). There’s 

a record board (in the weight 
room) and she pretty much 
owns every record.

She holds program records 

for back squat (350 lbs), bench 
press (175) and power clean 
(170).

She has great energy and 

thinks it’s super important. 
When she comes in here she 
works as hard as she can. Just 

a great athlete. She’s strong, 
she’s the fastest, she can jump 
the highest, she has the best 
conditioning on the team – 
which is rare. A lot of times you 
don’t see the strongest kid being 
the best conditioned. She’s a 
specimen. She’s an absolute 
freak. She’s an unsung hero. 
What she brings in the weight 
room is a dream for us. She’s a 
leader for us.

TMD: Too bad she’s a senior.
JP: Yeah, we’re going to need 

to find someone moving forward 
that fills that role.

On freshmen coming in:
TMD: How do the freshmen 

acclimate to the training?

JP: We need to identify their 

strengths and weaknesses right 
off hand. What we do is we’ll 
go through a whole screening. 
There’s different tests we do 
to help us identify if they have 
weaknesses in certain areas.

The first week (they get to 

campus) they’ll do this. Before 
they even lift or practice, they 
do this testing. Injuries are 
so prevalent, especially in the 
knee, so we want to make sure 
they can squat properly, they 
can hip pinch properly, they can 
jump and land properly before 
we even send them out there.

TMD: Is the transition hard 

for a lot of athletes?

JP: With high school girl’s 

basketball, the biggest thing is 
knee injuries. Every girl that 
comes in here, they’ve probably 
had some sort of knee issue in 
high school. A 
lot of them just 
don’t 
work 
on 

strength. So we 
have to identify 
any red flags and 
then 
I’ll 
work 

with 
Melissa 

(Poherence) 
— our athletic 
trainer 
— 
to 

work them out.

TMD: 
I 

assume they all come in with 
different 
levels 
of 
lifting 

experience?

JP: Yeah, it depends on where 

you are at when you come in 
here. As they move along and 
when they’re ready, we start 

testing 
them. 
For 
example, 

(Deja) Church came in as a 
freshman, and I didn’t test 
her on everything right away 
because she just wasn’t there 
yet. It took a minute before we 
did something like a back squat 
and power clean test because 
she didn’t know how to do it. 
But 
freshman 

Priscilla 
(Smeenge) came 
in, and she had 
training she had 
a good (lifting) 
background, 
and I was able 
to test her on 
everything.

TMD: 
What 

kind of testing 
do you do?

JP: We do vertical jump, 

sprint test, lane and agility, 
power clean, squat and bench 
press.

Some of the technology the 

team implements:

JP: We use this Fit Life 

Trainer. What you do is you 
put these reaction lights on the 
wall and set up a timer. The 
lights go off randomly, and we’ll 
have them get in a defense slide 
position and slide back and 
forth. I usually have them go for 
20 seconds.

Another thing we use is 

the Catapult. They wear it in 
practice every day and in games. 
It’s a GPS unit that goes on their 
back and monitors player load. 
It’s a number that identifies 

how many times 
they’ve cut, how 
far they’ve run, 
contact and all 
these 
different 

variables 
that 

go into one final 
number — they 
call that score 
the player load.

A 
lot 
of 
it 

right now is just 
data 
collection. 

Our next step is how can we 
actually apply it? How we can 
manipulate training with it? 
The idea behind it is to be able 
to see trends. Things like, “do 
we have weeks where our player 
loads are super high and we 

have to take a day and come 
down a little bit?”

TMD: 
Do 
you 
find 
the 

Catapult the most useful piece 
of technology you use?

JP: Yeah, just because it gives 

us a number in practice. It tells 
us how much they’re doing, 
which is hard to kind of quantify 
without this.

Working with the coaches:
TMD: How often and how 

closely do you work with the 
coaching staff?

JP: Quite a bit. I work with 

(assistant) 
coach 
Melanie 

Moore — especially when I first 
got here — weekly. We talk all 
the time about what the girls 
needed individually, what she 
thought the pulse of the team 
was and what she wanted the 
pulse to be. We would literally 
go player by player and (discuss) 
what they needed individually 
and how they are improving.

TMD: What about head coach 

Kim Barnes Arico?

JP: I pop in and I talk to 

coach Arico as much as I can. 
We talk before practice, and we 
always try to make sure we’re 
on the same page. They think 
strength and conditioning is 
super important, so coach Arico 
is in here all the time wanting 
to know what we’re doing. She 
asks me things like, “What do 
you think of this player? Can we 
get this player’s conditioning 
better?” It’s always a back-and-
forth, we always try and be on 

the same page. I 
take what they 
say to heart, and 
I do what I can 
in (the weight 
room) 
to 
help 

improve them on 
the court. I think 
it’s a really good 
relationship. 
They’re 
super 

bought into what 
we’re doing.

TMD: How much are the 

basketball practices and the 
strength and condition sessions 
intertwined?

JP: So coach Arico utilizes 

practice to get them in good 
shape. 
It’s 
actually 
been 

pretty easy for me in my end 
in the condition area because 
she runs such a high intense 
practice. They’re not just doing 
basketball, she’ll work in sprint 
drills and things like that.

TMD: Since it is such a 

condition-based practice, does 
that allow you to focus more on 
developing strength?

JP: Yeah, for sure. In season, 

for the most part, I can work 
on getting them stronger. In 
the offseason, when they’re not 
doing as much on the court, 
that’s when I have to focus more 
on the conditioning.

On the stigma of women 

and lifting weights:

TMD: Do you find even in 

an athletic setting, there’s a 
difficulty in the stigma that 
society has created with women 
and lifting?

JP: Yeah, it is different with 

women. Usually, with guys, 
they want to lift, they like to 
put a bunch of weight on and 
try and lift as heavy as they can. 
You know, some girls (say), “I 
don’t want to get too big or too 
bulky.” (Part of it) is getting 
them to understand that just 
because you’re strong doesn’t 
necessarily mean you have to be 
super bulky.

That’s why I think Jillian 

Dunston is such a big part. She 
came in here, she lifted heavy 
and got after it. And the rest 
of the team kind of falls in line 
with that. Having her helped 
a lot. With this team, I haven’t 
come across any issues with 
that.

TMD: 
Do 
you 
think 

in 
women’s 
athletics 
the 

importance of weight training 
gets overlooked?

JP: For sure. More times 

than not you’ll get a female 
athlete come in and not have any 
training.

TMD: Do you see that in 

men’s sports?

JP: In men’s sports, more 

guys work out. And you see 
that in the injuries in women’s 
basketball, they just don’t work 
out (when they’re younger). In 
women’s sports, you get more 
girls that come in here and have 
never even stepped foot in a 
weight room.

So being able to get them to 

understand why they are doing 
it is a big part of what we do.

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Senior forward Jillian Dunston has made an impression in her time at Michigan as being one of the hardest workers in the weight room for the Wolverines.

PHOTO COURTESY OF HUNTER SHARF

The Michigan women’s basketball team has to adjust to weight lifting in college because many have not done much of it in high school.

“It’s like 

coming in and 

doing some 

mobility drills.”

“Yeah, during 
the summer. 
We’ll go three 
times a week.”

“It depends on 
where you are 
at when you 
come in here.”

“Our next step 
is how can we 
actually apply 

it?”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 7, 2018


I

n a fit of extreme agitation the night 
before our first class, I haphazardly 
threw 
together 
another 
three 

lesson plans. Anxiety meant that sleep 
was improbable and creating increasingly 
incoherent worksheets honestly seemed 
like the best option. The next day, I 
would meet my group of English as a 
Second language adult learners, the 
people I’d spend the next four months 
tutoring through a local non-profit called 
Washtenaw Literacy.

I 
had 
first 
learned 
about 
this 

organization from a guest lecturer the 
previous 
semester, 
and 
immediately 

considered it as an opportunity to expand 
my worldview and actually use some of my 
linguistics major. Finally getting a class 
should have been an exciting prospect, 
except that I knew precisely nothing about 
my students. What languages would they 
speak? What level would I teach? Could 
they respect me, or even like me?

It was that last question that haunted me 

most. Because, why should they respect 
me? Each had left behind familiarity in 
search of something better. They had 
come to an unfamiliar country with sparse 
English skills and no guarantee of success, 
buoyed a hope that somehow things would 
work out.

Meanwhile, I was a kind-of sheltered 

college kid who had never lived more 
than 25 miles from my childhood home 
in Dearborn. There was no question that 
I would be younger than every single one 
of my learners. Sure I had a few months of 
training and observation to fall back on, 
but realistically, what could I offer them?

In the 30 minutes before the start of 

the session, my table filled with people 
from seven different countries. So many 
students at the table, but somehow the 
silence was absolutely deafening. Doing 
my best to feign confidence, I took a deep 
breath and introduced myself. I mean, how 
bad could it be?

It took only about three minutes for 

me to realize that it could, in fact, be very 
bad. I had spent all night making plans, 
but somehow every single one was either 
too complex or patronizingly easy. Every 
attempt to spark conversation fell flat, and 
I had somehow lost the ability to speak in 
full sentences. After a painful 90 minutes, 
class ended and I retreated to my car to 
shed some frustrated tears.

As defeated as that first lesson left me, I 

had committed to four months of tutoring 
and so I dragged myself back to class just a 
couple days later. This lesson wasn’t much 
better. It was difficult to create engaging 

materials and facilitating conversations 
seemed nearly impossible.

However, as I got to know these 

learners — their interests, their life stories, 
their families — our sessions improved. 
People actually spoke to each other and 
I got a better gauge of their proficiency. 
Every time I managed to clarify some 
grammatical quirk or found the perfect 
explanation for a ridiculous idiom, I felt 
a tiny thrill of triumph. I hoarded every 
single one of those little moments of 
success until they slowly became the norm.

It’s impossible to pinpoint when exactly 

things changed, but somewhere in that 
first month, our ESL classes went from 
excruciatingly uncomfortable to the best 
part of my week. I found myself noting 
down reading topics of interest or getting 
excited over potential speaking activities. 
So when my initial four months were up, I 
quickly committed to more, knowing many 
of my original learners would return. Now, 
nearly two years later, my time as a tutor 
draws to a close and I find myself reflecting 
often on this remarkable group of people.

While I am ostensibly the teacher, 

I’ve never truly felt the role. Rather, 
each ESL session teaches me something 
entirely original or encourages me to 
reevaluate my own viewpoints. Maybe 
I’m a little delusional, but I really think 
there’s something kind of magical about 
these sessions. Though the membership 
of this group is somewhat fluid — new 
students join, veteran ones move — the 
breakdown almost doesn’t matter. No 
matter who shows up each week, the 
groups somehow manage to transform 
our corner of a borrowed classroom into a 
full-on international summit — with each 
student contributing a unique viewpoint 
and background.

In our sessions, things like age, 

nationality and education maybe don’t 
disappear, but they do become remarkably 
insignificant. 
A 
seasoned 
Japanese 

software developer and a young German 
homemaker chat about American civics, 
commiserating over the absurdities of 
the English language. Facilitating these 
interactions isn’t always simple, but I’ve 
gained some key lessons along the way.

Silences can be awkward but almost 

never as bad as you think. Sure there 
are a few moments of panic when I ask 
a question and get only blank stares in 
response. But I’ve learned that blank 
stares rarely signal blank minds. There’s 
great value to moments of consideration, 
in navigating a restricted vocabulary when 
your thoughts are so much more complex.

It’s also given me an even greater 

appreciation for the resilience of each 
learner. Uprooting your life to move to 
another country is terrifying, to say the 
least. Doing it with limited language skills 
and without a guarantee of happiness 
seems 
almost 
unthinkable. 
Although 

hearing their stories of daily frustration 
and prejudice sometimes leaves me 
furious, I know each of these incidents just 
fuels to the determination to learn.

As important as English fluency is, some 

things transcend language altogether. In 
many ways, I only know my learners in the 
most superficial manner. Per policy, we 
have no contact outside of our sessions — 
no phone numbers or email addresses have 
been exchanged. Our relationship is built 
on just three hours of interaction each 
week.

Despite 
the 
language 
barrier, 
I 

sometimes feel that they know me as well 
as my closest friends. They wish me luck 
before every exam (and often give me 
advice on improving my study skills!), ask 
after my family and even bring remedies 
when I routinely turn up sick. In the same 
vein, two years has taught me countless 
things about each student. I know the 
foods they miss most from back home, 
which subjects their children struggle 
with and their goals for the future.

If this reads a little bit like a love letter 

to my ESL group, that’s because it is. 
Teaching ESL is simultaneously one of my 
most meaningful experiences and the one 
I find hardest to define. As graduation and 
my inevitable move out of Ann Arbor get 
ever closer, I can only thank this group for 
not immediately ditching me during that 
disastrous first month, for sending me off 
with new knowledge and perspectives, 
and for so many moments of appreciation 
and joy.

Brews Through: Panther Coffee, 

Dr. Smood, by Chloe

I

t’s not so surprising that the pale 
Michigander 
seeks 
sunshine 

and warmth from the dead cold. 

When winter lasts nine months of the 
year, we forget what it feels like to wear 
shorts and have sunscreen slathered 
in splotches on your face. I went to 
get some blood work done recently 
and it turns out I am suffering from a 
dangerous Vitamin D deficiency.

My best friend and I decided to make 

the trip down south to Miami. Almost 
everyone I’ve met in college evidently 
had the same idea. It’s my last break as 
an undergrad and I wanted to get some 
Vitamin D without eating triple-dose 
gummies twice a day.

We spent our mornings by the pool 

getting tan, feeling those pyrimidine 
dimers in our DNA, hoping we managed 
just 
enough 
sunscreen 
to 
avoid 

melanoma, but not too much to look 
un-ill for once. We spent our afternoons 
attempting to do homework, eating good 
food and drinking good coffee.

I accidentally bought a water bottle for 

17 dollars at the resort. My face seeing 
the receipt was akin to “The Scream.” 
We decided to get our coffee and snacks 
elsewhere for both quality and sanity.

Panther Coffee is a Miami-based 

coffee roaster, and a must-go if you’re 
in the neighborhood. They have five 
stores, but also sell their coffee beans 
elsewhere. We spent time at the Sunset 
Harbour location on Purdy Avenue, a hip 
getaway from the resort-tourist scene.

It’s a cozy set-up. The floor-to-ceiling 

windows let enough light into the cafe, 
though the hanging lights give off a 

nice, tinted ambiance. The whole place 
has an industrial feeling to it: the metal 
tables, large nuts and bolts screwed 
into the counters, exposed light bulbs, 
creamy gray concrete lining the walls. 
The customers match the mood, like 
an interior designer placed them there. 
Young businessmen in trendy suits, a 
fitness couple cooling off after a run, 
the plush golden retriever sitting by his 
owner, who’s wearing dark sunglasses, a 
woman grabbing a cold brew in her full-
denim outfit — it’s what I think of when 
I imagine “trendy.”

I was pleasantly surprised with the 

price, even after spending near 20 
dollars on a small Fiji water. It was still 
early when I sat down at Panther, so I got 
my morning regular: black Americano 
with their signature ham and cheese 
croissant. I spent less, enjoyed more 
— not that it’s that hard to find a more 
reasonably priced cafe in Miami.

Panther didn’t get itself to where it 

is just for reasonable prices. The coffee 
menu is dangerous for any caffeine lover, 
but they carry a generous selection of 
teas as well. The croissants are twice 
the size of my palm and had I stayed in 
Miami for longer, I would’ve made my 
way through the entire menu.

After spending five days in Miami, 

my friend and I flew back to Detroit. 
Correction: we tried.

We had a layover in LaGuardia before 

landing in Detroit on Thursday night. 
We planned a solid four days in Ann 
Arbor to enjoy some peace and quiet 
before the last sprint of the semester 
begins. The snowstorm in Detroit and 

then the storm in New York City 
threw a wrench in our plans.

I 
didn’t 
know 
what 
a 

“Nor’easter” was until the day 
my flight was canceled. Turns 
out it’s a specific type of storm 
where masses of cyclonic air are 
pushed counterclockwise and 
become pretty deadly. At this 
point, the Nor’easter that hit 
this weekend killed eight people 
on the East Coast. Our flight was 
canceled twice, pushing us back 
one day.

We decided to make a day out 

of our 24 hours in New York 
City, walking through a hailing 
Nor’easter with large suitcases 
and nothing but bikinis and 
sandals. We landed in another 
coffee shop where we met up 
with some old friends.

Dr. Smood is a healthy cafe. 

It 
was 
around 
the 
corner 

from the hotel we booked for 
the night (PSA: airlines don’t 

cover any hotels for weather-related 
cancellations). We got lucky, honestly. 
Dr. Smood is maybe trendier than 
Panther in certain ways, though they call 
themselves a “boutique” and are more 
of a hangout than a coffee place. They 
serve good coffee, but more emphasis on 
cold-pressed juices and organic shots — 
green algae, ginger, turmeric, you name 
it.

The boutique eatery is a getaway. 

The stone walls and black interior are 
sexy. They have wooden countertops 
for laptop usage and fancy couches to 
grab coffee with a colleague. Despite 
the mildly intimidating atmosphere, the 
baristas are kind.

It’s the place where I hang out in 

my hypothetical NYC life, along with 
my hypothetical job, my hypothetical 
wardrobe and my hypothetical high-rise 
overlooking Central Park.

At this point, the Nor’easter is 

building. Our flights are canceled for a 
third, then fourth, then fifth time. Our 
initial Thursday flight from New York to 
Detroit gets pushed to Sunday, so we are 
stuck in our layover destination for four 
days — four days. Sure, New York is the 
best city to get stuck in, but mind you, 
I have five bikinis, Birkenstocks and 
one pair of ripped jeans. My sunburn is 
starting to peel on my back and my body 

is confused with the 50-degree drop in 
temperature.

It’s our third day in New York City 

now. I am writing my column from 
another trendy, plush, slick coffee shop. 
Part of me wonders if the universe just 
wanted me to coffee shop hop my last 
spring break. The world somehow knew 
how I wanted to spend my break, it 
sensed my guilt by the pool not writing 
my thesis, not studying for exams, not 
preparing for the future.

So, I’m here in New York City debating 

if I should actually be productive touring 
grad 
schools, 
apartment-seeking, 

bracing for my life after graduation.

For now though, my coffee gives me 

comfort. The sustainable, plant-based, 
delicious cafe, by Chloe, has a few 
locations in Europe, in NYC, in LA, and 
some other fancy locales. I splurge at 
maybe the best location adjacent to the 
Rockefeller Center.

I don’t know what I expected from 

my last spring break, but it definitely 
wasn’t this. I’m not complaining, I feel 
nourished from skin to stomach to soul. 
It’s been a fulfilling time away from 
school. And if I’ve learned anything, 
it’s to keep taking strolls and opening 
doors to more coffee. Chasing the scent 
of coffee, no matter what city, seems to 
be the best way of traveling.

My grandfather’s escape from East Germany

Wednesday, March 7, 2018 // The Statement

5B

East to West

T

he year was 1960, and tear-
ing through the farmland 
on his motorcycle was my 
grandfather Helmut Krenz, 

age 20. A few hours later, he would be 
jailed in a cold East German prison cell, 
imprisoned because he tried to escape 
his authoritarian government.

Without the risks he would undertake 

in the coming months, my mother would 
have been born in East instead of West 
Germany, and likely would not have 
immigrated to the United States. I too 
would likely not enjoy the opportunities 
afforded to me today.
F

ollowing World War II, Ger-
many was split up “tempo-
rarily” by the four victorious 
Allied powers for the pur-

poses of rebuilding. However, the Soviet 
Union sought to permanently divide the 
country between East Germany and West 
Germany. Western soldiers looked east-
ward fearing another world war, while 
Communist forces along the border also 
looked eastward to prevent the state’s 
own citizens from fleeing to freedom.

While the West reaped the benefits of 

the Marshall Plan — United States aid to 
rebuild Europe after World War II — and 

a free market economy (what Germans 
still refer to as the “economic miracle”), 
the East regressed into a planned econ-
omy, the negative effects of which are 
still evident decades later. Those who 
lived in the East and had just been freed 
from the horrors of the Nazis and the 
Gestapo were again subjected to exploi-
tation and inhumane treatment at the 
hands of the East German secret police, 
the Stasi. Freedom of the press, religion, 
speech and travel were all severely cur-
tailed, and citizen’s felt as though they 
were constantly being watched.

Helmut’s formative years were spent 

in this geopolitical hotbed, less than 50 
miles from the Iron Curtain.
H

elmut was born in Ger-
many during World War 
II, but the Krenz family 
was forced by the Nazis 

to relocate to what is now Poland. In 
early 1945, caught between the enclos-
ing Soviets in the East and the Nazis in 
the West, they became refugees and fled 
through the brutally cold winter.

After months of running and living as 

refugees, the family returned and set-
tled on farmland in Warlitz, East Ger-
many, desperately hoping the worst was 

over. Helmut grew up working the farm, 
feeding the animals and enjoying rela-
tively peaceful childhood years.

However, he slowly became aware 

of the reality of the so-called German 
“Democratic” Republic. Indoctrination 
came first in the education system and 
he was forced to submit to Marxist-
Leninist ideology in his classes. He felt 
he couldn’t be open with his peers in 
school or question anything he learned, 
out of fear it would negatively affect his 
prospects for employment.

The absence of economic freedom and 

career mobility also contributed to the 
desire to escape. The government man-
dated that he stay and contribute as a 
farmer, but he knew he wanted to con-
tinue studying, obtain an education and 
be free to choose his own profession.

In addition to limits on his educa-

tional and career prospects, the East 
German state also actively persecuted 
those practicing religion, particularly 
Christians such as Helmut. The official 
position of the ruling Socialist Unity 
of Party of Germany was that Chris-
tian churches were foreign bodies and 
had no place in a socialist state, whose 
stated aim was an entirely atheist soci-

ety. Local church leaders were routinely 
arrested and imprisoned and felt like the 
Stasi was watching their every move.

Faced with these circumstances in 

his teenage years was the first time he 
had the yearning to leave the East. If cir-
cumstances allowed him to escape to the 
West, he would take the risk for freedom.
H

elmut’s first opportunity 
to escape arose shortly 
after he turned 20 in the 
fall of 1960. He would 

travel to Berlin on his motorcycle, then 
take the city tram in to meet up with fam-
ily friends and initially scout out the path 
to the West. However, once on the Ber-
lin train system, the East German police 
examined his passport and detained him.

He was taken to headquarters, locked 

in a prison cell and interrogated for 
hours. After this, the police confiscated 
his passport and told him he was no lon-
ger allowed to travel outside of his home-
town. For weeks the Stasi watched and 
periodically questioned him.

After seven weeks of this surveillance, 

he was called to the local police station 
in his hometown of Warlitz. The police 
chief brought him up to his office and 
initially appeared to be empathetic and 
compassionate — promising Helmut a 
good life if he subscribed to communist 
ideology and did as he was told. The chief 
even returned his passport, allowing him 
to once again freely travel throughout 
East Germany.

As the meeting was ending, however, 

the chief coldly looked Helmut in the 
eyes and said, “I give you one warning, if 
we catch you on the way to Berlin anoth-
er time, then 10 years imprisonment is 
sure for you.”

Helmut was stunned and frustrated 

— he was no criminal, he simply wanted 
freedom and a better life.
H

e would defy the govern-
ment’s 
stern 
warning 

when he left home with 
another would-be defec-

tor the day after Christmas in 1960. He 
made the difficult choice to leave his 
family behind, not knowing if he would 
ever see them again. He left with noth-
ing but the clothes on his back and a 
toothbrush; knowing if he carried any-
thing more, he would likely be stopped 
and questioned.

In order to not arouse suspicion, he 

first traveled to Leipzig, East Germa-

ny instead of going directly to Berlin, 
spending Christmas at a conference 
in the city to throw off anyone watch-
ing him as to his true intentions. On 
Dec. 26, 1960, he planned to connect to 
the central train station in East Berlin. 
Before the Berlin Wall was constructed 
in 1961, the trains in the city still ran 
between the East and West under heavy 
passport control once onboard the train. 
This was the way he would theoretically 
get to the West.

When setting out from Leipzig, the 

friend he was traveling with decided sec-
onds before boarding the train he would 
not attempt to escape given the immi-
nent danger. Helmut pleaded with him to 
come aboard the train, but the doors sud-
denly slammed shut — leaving him alone 
on his four-hour journey to Berlin.

Some people, especially Germans, are 

familiar with the story of a young Mar-
tin Luther, who, facing death during 
a lightning storm, pledged to become 
a monk if he was spared. Knowing his 
next stop could be prison, Helmut made 
a similar pledge: To serve God if granted 
his freedom against these insurmount-
able odds.

On the train, he found an open seat 

across from a high-ranking East German 
officer. When it came time to show pass-
ports, the border guards gave his only a 
quick once-over look, figuring any young 
man sitting near an officer surely did 
not need to be checked. An overwhelm-
ing sense of relief came over him at that 
moment, but he wasn’t safe yet.

Often times to their detriment, Ger-

mans are known for having a rigidly 
hierarchical view of authority (the VW 
emissions scandal is a perfect modern-
day example). Thankfully, the East Ger-
man hierarchy was alive and well on 
this day.

Once in Berlin, he quickly followed the 

dense crowds to the Berlin tram system. 
He had memorized the map and knew he 
had to get off at Gesundbrunnen, the sta-
tion in the West. He was scared to look at 
or speak with anyone on the train, fearing 
there were Stasi spies in the mix of com-
muters. It was highly unusual there was 
no passport control on the train that day, 
and when he reached Gesundbrunnen, he 
jumped out of the train to freedom.

“No one can describe what that feeling 

was like,” he said.
S

ince God held up his end of 
the bargain, Helmut stuck to 
his promise, eventually lead-
ing churches in West Germa-

ny, Switzerland and Sterling Heights, 
Michigan as a pastor. Many have come 
to Detroit seeking employment with 
one of the “Big Three” — Chrysler, Ford 
and General Motors — but he would joke 
with people and tell them he was in town 
to work for the “Big One” — God.

For Helmut, the so-called “American 

Dream” was never about wealth accumu-
lation or status, but simply the opportu-

nity this country presented. His family 
could live here in peace, free from gov-
ernment oversight, with access to great 
schools. The Krenz family enjoyed simi-
lar freedom and a good life in Switzer-
land, but Helmut and his wife Isolde felt 
it was time to move to Michigan for their 
children’s educational benefit.

Helmut’s family did not have much 

money and my mother, born in Erkelenz, 
West Germany, didn’t know any English 
after arriving in Michigan. When she 
began fifth grade during her first school 
year here, she could only read at a first 
grade level. But my grandfather would 
challenge them: “If other kids can do it, 
you can too.” By the end of that first year, 
she was ahead of the rest of the class 
and reading at an eighth grade level. No 
one in their family before them had a 
formal college education. Through hard 
work, my mother ended up receiving a 
full scholarship to attend Wayne State 
University.

In part because Helmut chose to leave 

everything he knew behind on that fate-
ful day in 1960, two of his children went 
on to receive doctorates, one became a 
concert pianist, and another helps run a 
business. I too have the opportunity to 
now attend the University of Michigan as 
a result.
I

n 2016, I had the opportunity to 
travel to Berlin and retrace my 
grandfather’s footsteps while 
studying abroad. The train still 

runs from the former East German cen-
tral station to Gesundbrunnen, the for-
mer station of liberation. As I sat there 
riding through the city on that sunny 
day, I thought about how blessed I am 
that Helmut took the risk of escaping.

When he was 20 in Berlin, he faced 

the prospect of at least a decade in 

prison to obtain freedom, while my trip 
was spent leisurely enjoying the city. He 
had to watch his back to ensure the Stasi 
didn’t tail him on the train; I simply had 
to use Google Maps to find the correct 
routes. He was forced to make life-defin-
ing decisions, I was faced with the choice 
of whether I should sample a local curry-
wurst or grab McDonald’s for lunch.

This stark generational contrast is 

thanks to the establishment of a free 
society in Germany. So often we take our 
liberty for granted, but we must remem-
ber it is a result of years of sacrifice and 
striving toward equality, individualism, 
representative government, peace and 
freedom for all. I will likely never have to 
risk my own life in order to secure these 
ideals for future generations, but we 
should be thankful many of our parents, 
grandparents and families did before us. 
Some escaped dictators, many fought in 
the armed forces to keep us safe, while 
countless others made daily sacrifices in 
order to send their children to college or 
move to a better neighborhood.

Sitting there in Berlin, I realized my 

grandfather’s story of oppression and 
journey to freedom influences the way I 
see the world today. My belief that Amer-
ica should welcome immigrants fleeing 
persecution, that individuals deserve to 
take home more of their own paychecks 
or that the size of government should be 
limited, are rooted in the abuses Helmut 
and countless others faced and still face 
at the hands of authoritarian regimes in 
North Korea, China, Venezuela, Russia 
and elsewhere around the world.
T

his year marks 28 years 
since the wall was torn 
down — the same number 
of years it was standing. 

Thankfully my grandfather was able 

to move through Berlin just months 
before the East German government 
shocked the world by constructing it 
overnight in 1961. He knows it wouldn’t 
have been possible for him to get out 
once the structure was in place.

In a recent conversation with him, I 

asked what his reaction was when the 
Berlin Wall fell and his home country 
was reunified in 1990.

He reiterated his belief that when-

ever a government attempts to stifle 
people, that institution will ultimately 
fail. The deep irony of East Germany’s 
attempted repression of religion is that 
the peaceful protest movement that 
eventually led to the toppling of the 
Berlin Wall began in churches.

Totalitarianism 
eventually 
fails 

and gives way to mankind’s inherent 
desire for self-government, but con-
scious strides must be made in order 
for this to happen. While leaders like 
U.S. President Ronald Reagan and 
General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev 
of the Soviet Union set the pendulum 
of freedom into motion, the will and 
belief of the millions of people were 
eventually what pulled back the Iron 
Curtain.

As one of the millions of people 

who are fortunate enough to now 
reap the benefits of living in this 
free society, I feel an overwhelming 
sense of responsibility to continue to 
improve America as a beacon of hope 
and a land of opportunity for all peo-
ple. Only through open dialogue and 
mutual respect for one another can 
we prevent the re-emergence of the 
failed philosophies of the prior cen-
tury perpetrated in the Eastern bloc, 
experienced by my grandfather and 
countless others like him.

Do UC me

A

t first, I thought my illness 
was the flu or maybe the 
dreaded 
norovirus—nothing 

out of the ordinary for a college student. 
But I was in for a rude awakening. Little 
did I know my symptoms were actually 
the beginning of an entirely new life 
challenge I was totally unprepared for.

I found out one year ago these 

developing symptoms were actually 
ulcerative 
colitis, 
a 
chronic 

inflammatory bowel disease that causes 
bleeding in the digestive tract. I was in 
the middle of a severe flare-up, meaning 
the 
inflammation 
had 
suddenly 

worsened, causing me serious pain.

It 
took 
several 
time-consuming 

medical tests before my diagnosis. I 
discovered everyone who lives with 
UC has a different and unpredictable 
experience. It is called an “invisible” 
disease since many people who have it 
look healthy, but destructive things are 
occurring on the inside.

It interrupted every aspect of my 

life during Lent; a solemn season of 
penance, prayer and fasting, in which 
Catholics devote their lives to sacrifice. 
As a result of my new condition, I was 
about to learn a new meaning of Lent: 
perseverance.

I have gone to church on Sunday for my 

entire life, so going after my diagnosis 
was not an escape for me, but rather 
somewhere I might be understood and 
finally comforted. Without a cure or 
any ability to calm my symptoms, I was 
losing control over my daily routine. Not 
that the timing ever would have been 
ideal, but this also came during a packed 
semester when I was taking 17 credits.

The first doctor I visited told me I 

would just “feel better” after taking 
what was prescribed to me as if it were 
so simple. I was given several medicines 
to try, but never found one to subdue 
my symptoms at any point during the 
semester.

After grinding through school one 

day, I remember reaching back out 
and informing them my symptoms had 
worsened and I was struggling mentally. 
A few days later I got a message from a 
nurse saying, “It takes time.”

I did not have time.
Time, if anything, was running out. 

It was not just the physical debilitation 
—– losing over 20 pounds and not being 
able to eat nutritiously or exercise —– 
but also the psychological pain that 
weighed me down. Each day chipped 
away at my patience, my faith and my 
will. It was isolating, to say the least.

I could not find any balance and 

became depressed. Because I was afraid 

to eat anything, I could not focus and 
also began struggling in my classes. 
Skipping breakfast and lunch became a 
habit as I could only tolerate some soup, 
juice or salad, if I was lucky. I would try 
eating something for dinner, but could 
never finish a full meal.

I was losing touch with myself, often 

putting on a happy face in public to 
not worry others. It became a daily 
challenge to try to hide my symptoms 
as best as I could in front of my friends, 
teachers and classmates. If you are 
unaware of the symptoms of untreated 
UC, now would be the time to Google it. 

Needless to say, I was embarrassed and 
terrified at the thought of being seen as 
an outcast.

Doing routine things, like hanging 

out with friends, suddenly became 
risky. Without warning, I’d rush to 
find the closest restroom. Upon them 
asking what was wrong, I tried my best 
to describe it, but never could find the 
right words to do so.

As a result, I shut people out and 

stayed in as much as possible. My 
mood was enigmatic so I became quiet, 
frustrated by uncertainty.

My 
friends 
and 
family 
were 

supportive and sympathetic. My parents 
were the only ones I confided many of 
my thoughts in. This was never an issue. 

I just never had the courage to tell 
anybody how bad things really were, 
not only physically, but also mentally. 
Nobody warned me beforehand how 
psychologically draining this could 
become.

I asked myself, “Why now? Why 

Lent?”

In my frustration, I swore both at 

myself and at God. I thought, “How 
could you do this to me now?” Though 
it was upsetting to do so, it also felt 
liberating, like a weight had been lifted 
off my shoulders. At first, I would try 
lying to myself, thinking everything 

was fine and then 
doing 
something 

destructive 
like 

going out at night 
with friends.

I quickly learned 

instead I had to feel 
all of my emotions 
and express them. 
I 
was 
reminded 

no 
matter 
how 

you feel, you have 
to be honest with 
yourself in a life of 
faith. This would 
help me avoid doing 
things 
that 
put 

my health at risk 
and 
subsequently 

allowed me to move 
forward.

I still kept my 

anxiety to myself, 
though. 
Moments 

of 
comfort, 
or 

freedom 
from 

isolation, 
came 

during mass at St. 
Thomas, 
where 

I 
heard 
biblical 

stories of hardship 
and determination 

and prayed alongside others. It gave me 
the courage to believe things would get 
better. Quite honestly, it gave me the 
little bit of the hope I needed to make it 
through the week.

My symptoms were still damaging in 

the week leading up to Easter, and none 
of the medicine I was taking helped. 
Thankfully, though, it was the end of 
the semester; I didn’t have to drop any 
classes and I could go home.

Once I moved back home, I was 

abruptly 
hospitalized, 
making 
me 

realize just how defeated my body and 
mind really were. I was allergic to one of 
my failing medications, causing painful 
acute pancreatitis and forcing me to 
spend three nights in the hospital. The 

doctors told me this only happened to 
around 2 percent of people who took 
this medicine.

Despite 
this 
setback, 
stability 

returned to my life after beginning 
treatment on a new medicine. It 
successfully suppresses my symptoms, 
and I receive it every two months 
through an hour-long infusion.

I no longer had to rely on a clear liquid 

diet. Instead, I could enjoy real food and 
slowly ease myself back into working 
out. Though I have yet to regain most of 
my lost weight, I feel normal again.

By May, Lent was over, and I was 

beginning to feel relieved. For the first 
time in what felt like forever, I was 
comfortable and could breathe easier. I 
could actually see the beauty in things 
again, rather than having to constantly 
worry where the closest bathroom was.

Today marks a year since my symptoms 

began, and Lent has again returned. 
Despite the vast improvements in my 
health, it is still a challenge for me to 
find everyday balance. I struggle when 
symptoms 
unexpectedly 
resurface 

and remind me I still have limits 
and must eat only certain foods, take 
dietary supplements, probiotics and 
receive infusions to keep my body from 
returning to a damaging state.

Though I am still unsure how or why 

this all happened, I am more honest 
with myself now. I cannot take anything 
in life for granted and must take my 
health very seriously; doing everything 
I can to avoid any future setbacks. I 
have come to terms with knowing I will 
live with this affliction for the rest of 
my life.

I recognize now the psychological 

toll this experience has taken on me. 
Looking back, I wish I had done more for 
my mental health rather than allowing 
my isolation and pride to prevent me 
from getting the help I really needed. I 
have been fortunate to join the Crohn’s 
and Colitis Student Initiative, which 
promotes awareness of inflammatory 
bowel disease and its effects so students 
can feel more supported on campus.

Staying faithful and being honest 

includes knowing your limits and 
recognizing when things are wrong. 
Especially when you yourself are 
wrong. It also means not being afraid 
of what people might say and, above all 
else, not lying to yourself. After all, this 
is what Lent is all about.

I know now better than ever that 

making it by in life is not the difficult 
part. Overcoming not just physical, 
but also psychological hardship is the 
difficult part.

I

’m back, facade up and ready to 
soundtrack once again.

The 
Winter 
Olympics 
— 

the only time America is actually 
invested in sports like ski slalom 
and shuffleboard on ice. In an effort 
to declare our country the global 
champions 
of 
snow, 
millions 
of 

Americans gather around the TV for 
the month of February in their homes, 
libraries or respective newsrooms to 
witness heartbreaks and triumphs. 
We laugh, we cry, we stare in awe 
but most importantly, we recognize 
our own athletic limitations, because 
I don’t know about you but I could 
never perform remotely close to the 
athletes who complete triple axel 
double-sided backflips while juggling 
chainsaws in the Winter Olympics.

My career with sports has not been 

the most decorated. In third grade, 
my baseball team won our league 
championship. With my trophy in 
hand, I ran home and celebrated 
the victorious season. Eventually, I 
memorialized that season by making 
my first email address username, 
“baseballchamp7.” At our final team 
party, my coach posted our batting 
averages and I ran to see how much 
I had accomplished. Babe Ruth’s 
record, here I come.

.000
I didn’t hit a single ball. I was walked 

a few times but my championship 
victory had clouded my actual stats, 
convincing me I was the true baseball 
champ. From there, everything went 
downhill for sports, as I favored the 
summer musical over joining a soccer 
team with my friends.

What I don’t understand about the 

Winter Olympics is how I, a 20-year-
old child, am missing my Kobe free 
throws into trash cans while THESE 
14-YEAR-OLDS 
ARE 
WINNING 

GOLD???

Fountain 
of 
Youth 
— 
Local 

Natives

At the age of some of these Olympic 

stars, I couldn’t hammer a nail into a 
set piece without taking a breather. I 
couldn’t run a mile if my life depended 
on it, yet these athletic icons can 
complete front flips and side twists 
and whatever else they do while 
strapped to a literal piece of wood 
going a million miles an hour down 
a halfpipe. Some of these Olympians 
are just now going through puberty. 
Can you imagine being broadcast 
on global TV after winning a gold 
medal, only to voice crack during the 
interview?

Sometimes I like to imagine what 

the Olympics would be like if — 
instead of this whole “training for 

your entire life and qualifying for a 
spot on the national team” thing — 
we randomly selected representatives 
from each country to participate in 
the winter events like the “Hunger 
Games” lottery. Possibly no athletic 
experience, but you just have to try 
your best and hope the judges respect 
your valiant effort.

I’m 99 percent sure if my name was 

called to represent the United States 
in some wild event like the ski jump, 
once everyone saw my build and 
lack of athletic potential practically 
written on my face, everyone in the 
country would throw in the towel and 
accept defeat.

Represent — Nas
Think about the ski jump for a 

minute — participants are strapped 
into long poles that make them 
look like scuba divers walking with 
flippers, positioned at the top of a 
steep hill, pushed down, launched 
into the sky at 60 miles per hour and 
expected to land on the skis and be 
perfectly fine.

How people survive this jump, I 

have no clue. I’ve tried standing up 
on a sled and have eaten the ground 
on every attempt after .5 seconds of 
motion. Just looking at me, everyone 
would know I was going to fail. I 
would be shaking in my boots just 
looking at the jump. If I can’t watch 
the event on TV without flipping 
out and staring slack-jawed, what 
makes you think I would be a solid 
representative for the U.S. at the 
Winter Olympics?

This is why I like the random lottery 

idea for the Olympics — everyone is 
an underdog.

Comeback Kid (That’s My Dog) — 

Brett Dennen

I love rooting for the underdog: 

Cool Runnings, The Karate Kid, Erin 
Brockovich. All of ‘em.

In this imaginary Winter Olympics, 

I would be the ultimate underdog — 
Air Bud.

No one expects Air Bud to be good at 

every sport known to man (or dog), yet 
he always comes out on top. Against 
all odds, a dog can beat a human in 
basketball, soccer, volleyball and all 
of the other franchise installments. 
I’m pretty sure the Olympics viewers 
would have more faith in a golden 
retriever on skis than they would 
have for me. Even I would trust Air 
Bud to come home with the gold.

With my skis, helmet and lack of 

confidence, I’d somehow maneuver 
my way to the top of the ramp despite 
only having skied twice in my life. 
Skiing lessons at Pine Knob when I 
was 10 would not have prepared me 

for this event. Despite there being 
no way to confuse the initial starting 
point, I know I would look like a 
cartoon and eventually find myself 
facing backward away from the ramp.

Movin Backwards — A Tribe 

Called Quest

My Olympic debut would look like 

a Charlie Chaplin routine but there 
would be absolutely nothing funny 
about it to me. I would be terrified. 
Cameras would flash as announcers 
and spectators would question my 
decision to launch off backward. Some 
would say, “He’s gotta be insane,” but 
others would be more optimistic with 
thoughts like, “Let’s hope his tactic 
works out.”

Just then, I’d hear the countdown 

but we all know I’d accidentally start 
heading down the hill too early, 
waving my arms frantically, calling 
for them to stop the ride so I can get 
off. However, this ride has no red 
button to stop.

I’d gain speed despite constant 

shifts of balance. My knees would be 
absolutely locked out of straight fear. 
As I hit the final lip, with everyone 
expecting me to break my legs, I’d see 
the crowd shield their eyes.

Never a good sign.
Closing my eyes, I’d feel nothing 

below my skis anymore. My only 
savior — the ground — would be far 
gone.

Off The Ground — Anderson Paak
In the wise words of Vanessa 

Hudgens and Drew Seeley (this is the 
hill I want to die on): “We’re soarin, 
flyin.”

I think me and everyone else 

watching at home would just be 
surprised I made it this far. Maybe I 
was the true ski jump champion we all 
needed. I’d set records, innovate the 
sport and retire early to make more 
time for Sports Illustrated interviews 
and writing my memoirs.

But this isn’t how this daydream is 

destined to end. I think too lowly of 
myself to have it end triumphantly 
even though it’s my own dream and I 
can do whatever I want.

The moment one of my skis touched 

the ground, and I mean one and not 
both, the pressure would be too much. 
The weight of high-profile celebrity 
status coupled with my inadequate 
physical condition would cause my 
legs to buckle and my body to hit the 
tightly-packed landing, not making 
for a soft descent into a blanket of 
snow.

Shake, Rattle and Roll — Sam 

Cooke

Have you ever seen an actual 

person start rolling down a mountain 
so quickly they form into a large 
snowball, constantly picking up more 
and more mass as gravity does the 
rest? Well, I like to think I’d be the 
first to accomplish this during such a 
widely-broadcasted event.

It says a lot about my upbringing 

that I dream in cartoon tropes but 
this is what I would suspect would 
happen. Any dreams of me being Air 
Bud would immediately be crushed 
and I would become a gigantic ball of 
disappointment barreling toward the 
finish line. A safety hazard, yes, but 
also a beautiful sight to see. I’d be the 
best bottom third of a snowman the 
world had ever seen. Forget ski jump, 
that’s my new Olympic event.

Dazed 
and 
Confused 
— 
Led 

Zeppelin

Hitting the bottom, birds would 

travel around my head like planets in 
orbit and I would probably forget my 
own name. The interview after would 
hopefully make it on the Daily Mail 
Snapchat story.

I guess I’m just going to stick with 

staring in awe at the next Olympics 
and 
heading 
to 
the 
Intramural 

Building when I can’t think of 
literally anything else to do with my 
time.

Soundtracking: The Winter Olympics

A week before Spring Break, one of the editors at Michigan in Color, Na’kia Channey, reached out to 
me spontaneously, “Hey. Would you like to come to D.C. with us to photograph?” “Uh … I guess.”
I was told that the purpose of this trip to D.C. was to explore the forgotten history of marginalized 
communities centered in our capital. As part of my job description, I was supposed to photograph 
the trip. However, when I strapped on my camera in D.C., I realized I’m not simply a photographer. I, 
too, am a person of color. As an Asian immigrant, this matters to me personally. It is important for 
us to understand marginalized communities and our histories.
