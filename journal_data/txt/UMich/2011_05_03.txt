White House
Business students
in D.C. celebrate the
death of bin Laden
By STEPHANIESTEINBERG
Editor in Chief
A group of University students
say they were among the first to
arrive outside the White House
gates after President Barack Obama
announced Osama bin Laden's
death late Sunday night.
About 60 University students
from the Ross School of Business are
studying in Washington D.C. this
week as part of the University's Car-
son Scholars program which grants
participants course credits. Many
of the students were in their hotel
rooms when they heard the leader
of the Sept.11 attacks was dead.
Even before Obama made the
official announcement, Business
seniors Ifat Ribon, Karen Zelby and
Mariya Pojidaev rushed out of their
hotel room shortly after turning on
the news.
"We went literally sprinting
down toward the White House,"
Zelby said.
Pojidaev said when they got
there around 11:30 p.m., a small
group of University of Michigan
students were gathered at the gates

Editor in Chief andDaily NewsEditor
In his address to graduates
at the University's Spring Com-
mencement ceremony Saturday
at Michigan Stadium, Republican
Gov. Rick Snydertalked abouthow
his collegiate experiences shaped
his work in both the private and
public sectors and urged students

to be "explorers" in their quest for
self-discovery.
In a speech that shied away
from the political issues that have
sparked controversy among many
Michigan citizens since he was
elected last November, Snyder
emphasized the importance of the
University's resources in provid-
ing vast opportunities for students
to become leaders and inspire pos-
itive change.
"Michigan is a special place
to me and when you think about
making a commencement address,
you have two choices," Snyder
said. "You can talk about major
issues, or you can talk about your
life and personal issues. Today I'm
going to talk about my personal

About 40,000 people attended
the ceremony at the Big House,

of changing the buffer boundary -

1,000 to 1,010 feet.
"In working with staff, we've
identified that 1,010 feet does a

accomplish what we're trying to
accomplish," Hohnke said. "The

corners more whole and locations
more continuous."
Council members Sandi Smith
(D-Ward 1) and Sabra Briere (D-

"1,000 feet is more than cau-

COMMENCEMENT
From Page 1A
Snyder - a self-proclaimed
"workaholic" who earned three
degrees from the University - said
his academic experience, as well as
the various organizations and jobs
he was a part of during his time at
the University, inspired his pas-
sion for helping others. He added
that his time at the University
also led to the development of his
three-pronged career plan, which
includes working as a businessman
and public official with the ultimate
goal of becoming a teacher after his
time as governor ends.
"I would probably be at the
far end of the least worldly person
when I showed up at the Univer-
sity of Michigan," Snyder said. "I
had fabulous parents but I didn't
have a lot of opportunity."
In his speech, Snyder lauded
the University for being world-
renowned in numerous programs,
adding that its academic strength
provides students with many oppor-
tunities in their quests toward self-
realization.
"The true uniqueness here is
the intersection between being the
best of the world in so many fields,"
Snyder said. "It's about having an
environment where you can build
your own path through so many of
them.
He added that while many
critics say the size of the Universi-
ty hinders its ability to fully focus
on individual student needs, the
expansive student body and vast
amount of organizations allow
students to excel in their post-col-

legiate lives and careers.
"Our strength is our breadth
and size," Snyder said. "We need
to stop being defensive about our
breadth and size and start being
proud of it."
Snyder also said students are
often attracted to the University
for its "spirit of exploration" and for
seeking a career path that helps the
common good.
"You are all explorers and
when you were exploring at the
University of Michigan you're mis-
sion was straightforward, it was
to graduate and you have achieved
that fabulous goal today," Snyder
said. "The next thing is you need a
mission for the future."
While he said today's gradu-
ates do not necessarily need to
have a finalized plan before grad-
uating, he said students should
engage in areas that positively
impact their communities and the
common good.
"What the best really means in
my view is giving your best...and
that's by doing that in a positive
fashion," Snyder said. "A forward
looking fashion."
University President Mary
Sue Coleman preceded Snyder,
and talked about the importance
of leadership in the University
community and beyond. She rec-
ognized former Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly President Chris
Armstrong as "a proven leader"
who persevered amid criticism for
being openly gay.
"He has represented you on
campus and in Lansing...and yet
what created the biggest headlines
for Chris is the fact that he is a gay
man, the first to lead the Michigan

Student Assembly," Coleman said.
"When this generated criticism
and bullying, he did not blink. He
continued to hold his head high
as student body president and as a
Michigan student and to speak out
for equality, tolerance and compas-
sion. That's what leaders do."
Coleman added that the Uni-
versity strives to prepare students
to take on leadership roles by pro-
moting tolerance and developing
inner strength.
"We're serious about creating
thoughtful leaders," Coleman said.
"Our world needs strong, decisive
individuals. Individuals who listen,
who gather and respect different
ideas and who act boldly based on
an informed point of view."
"This is no time for wavering,
but rather for people who are will-
ing to stand up for their beliefs and
ideas," she added. "People unafraid
to challenge the status quo, people
eager to take risks because big risks
can deliver big rewards."
The student speaker for the
ceremony was Jillian Joan Gar-
ment Rothman, an LSA graduat-
ing senior who concentrated in
political science, with a minor in
Afro-American studies. Rothman
told students not to be reserved in
their careers and instead be bold
in their post-collegiate pursuits.
"Being overly cautious is not
a product of growing up, it's just
called boring," Rothman said.
"The greatest men and women of
our community were the ones not
afraid to take risks or get messy."
"All we must realize is that by
avoiding risks in fear of failure we
have essentially failed already," she
added.

In an interview after the cer-
emony, Architecture graduate Rick
Figura said he was glad Snyder
spoke mostly about his own person-
al experiences, rather than politics.
"I think if he had gotten into
politics he would've gotten quite a
reaction (from the crowd)," Figura
said. "All in all I thought it was a
decent speech, politics aside."
Still, Figura said he expected
more extreme protests than just the
handful of students who stood with
their backs to Snyder as he spoke.
Clark Evans, an LSA gradu-
ate said he thought the graduation
ceremony wasn't the appropriate
venue to protest Snyder's policies.
"I have a problem with the pro-
testers in the fact that he's a Michi-
gan graduate," Clark said. "So, I
think that it's not appropriate, espe-
cially at commencement, to display
their concerns with the governor."
School of Music graduate Alex-
andra Kozak said the standing stu-
dent protesters didn't offend her
and commended Snyder for speak-
ing despite the controversy sur-
rounding the speech.
"When people were actually
booing it bothered me," Kozak said.
"There's a level of respect, I mean
they're still people. But the back
turning, that's a quiet way of show-
ing your protest."
Despite the protests, she said
graduating was a "surreal" experi-
ence.
"It was overwhelming,"
Kozak said. "The sheer size of it,
the Big House and then all the
people. The family bond, even
though there's 7,000 graduates,
having that many people behind
you is really great."

"We were lucky enough to be

"(We) saw what was going on and
figured we better take this oppor-
tunity because it will definitely be a

Eisbrouch, who arrived in

for the Carson Scholars program,
said he's grateful he was in the capi-

witness the reaction of people on
the streets.
"It's like a national high for

Obama announced in a tele-

tary counter-terrorism unit.
No Americans or civilians were
injured, but three adult males -
including one of bin Laden's sons -
were killed in the attack. The U.S. is
now in custody of bin Laden's body.
Ribon said bin Laden's death
is a "big accomplishment" for the

for many University students, who
believe bin Laden's passing will
serve as a way to unite the United
States and move the nation closer to
ending the war on terrorism. Presi-
dent Barack Obama announced in a
televised address last night that bin
Laden was killed in Pakistan early
Monday by American troops.
Business and LSA senior Steve
Benavides said he was watching
baseball with his roommates when
they heard the news. The group
immediately started playing the
national anthem on their comput-
ers, while they heard fireworks
exploding in the distance.
Benavides said bin Laden's
death provides a sense of closure
for Americans and serves as a way
to unite the American people amid
a tense political climate.
"This is a highly politicized
time whether you're a Republican
or Democrat, but this one event is
something that 300 million Ameri-
cans can get behind, 300 million
Americans can take solace in and
300 million Americans can rejoice
over," Benavides said.
He added that bin Laden's
death is a "highly symbolic event"
not only for Americans and those
directly impacted by the Sept. it
terrorist attacks, but also for peo-
ple in other parts of the world who
have been affected by the reign of
terror established under al-Qaida.
"It's not just Americans cel-
ebrating tonight, it's a worldwide
thing," Benavides said. "He's just
been a threat to mankind, to Chris-
tianity, Judaism, Muslim and other
religions as a whole."
Will McDowell, a Business stu-
dent who graduated in Saturday's
Spring Commencement ceremony,
said he doesn't believe bin Laden's
death will ultimately solve the

Mejia said the announcement
of bin Laden's death will serve as
a catalyst for a positive advance-
ment in American morale and will
become an event that transcends
the increasing disparities in parti-
san sentiment.
"I think it's a bigday," Mejia said.
"Obviously things aren't over, but
it's important to take this day and
celebrate this accomplishment. It's
good for morale - it's an American
thing, it's not Democrat or Republi-
can, so that's a nice refresher right
now.
He added: "I'm proud to be an
American today, and it's not always
easy to say that, but today it is."
As the pair celebrated, a stu-
dent on the street opened a bottle
of champagne and sprayed it in the
air while cars drove past with pas-
sengers chanting "USA" and blast-
ing songs like "Born in the USA" by
Bruce Springsteen. Other confused
passersby questionedthe duo about
the flurry of activity.
Christopher Zukowski, an
employee of Ashley's Restaurant on
State Street, said he turned all the
televisions to the president's news
conference and raised the volume
after a customer asked to hear the
news.
"Once people realized what was
happening, everyone got quiet and
listened," he said.
Zukowski, an Ann Arbor resi-
dent, said the only time a moment
like this happened in the past three
years was the night Obama was
elected in 2008.
Though Ashley's closes at mid-
night, the bar extended its closing
time by a half hour since the major-
ity of patrons were still in the bar.

Medicinal discrimation
Marijuana should be considered a legitimate medication
In 2008, Joseph Casias won an award from a Walmart in Battle
Creek, Michigan for being its Associate of the Year. In 2009, they
fired him. A medical marijuana patient with sinus cancer and an
inoperable brain tumor the size of a softball, Casias was drug tested fol-
lowing a knee injury at work. After testing positive for - you guessed it -
marijuana, he was let go. He never used the drug at work nor was he ever
under its influence while working. The American Civil Liberties Union
subsequently filed a lawsuit against Walmart in support of Casias, but a
federal judge dismissed the case in February. Last week, however, the
ACLU petitioned an appellate court to review it. If the federal appeals
court has any investment in the laws of Michigan, which it most cer-
tainly should, it must reexamine this case.

I've generally considered myself
an innocent bystander as corpo-
rate policies
wreak havoc
around the
world. I haven't
been out on the,
street protest-
ing everyday,
but by no means
have I thought
that I've been JONATHAN
supporting vio- AYLWARD
lence or immor-_
al corporations,
even indirectly.
I haven't actively supported weap-
ons contractors, big oil, corporate
farming or voted for war-mon-
gering business. Sadly, it turns
out that by just attending the
University of Micbigan I've been
supporting exactly tbe kinds of
companies and products to which
I am morally opposed.
Two weeks ago I went home and
had one of those slightly uncom-
fortable conversations in which I
was forced to try to defend an ideal
against my family. My parents are
progressive and extremely liberal
in almost every sense, but when
I started talking to my dad about
potentially investing in the stock
market, I uncovered something
that made me uneasy: my parents
invest their money in bonds and
mutual funds, a practice as com-
mon as owning a car. As my dad
explained what each of these were,
he described how mutual funds
diversified his money in a variety
of companies for enhanced safety.
It turns out that some of his money
was invested in companies that he
knew hardly anything about.
I'm not chastising my dad; he's a
great man. Along with my mom, he
has helped send all three of his kids
to school, as well as provided abun-
dant love and a comfortable life for
our family. I was just a little disap-
pointed to hear that he was poten-
tially investing money in companies
that could be doing anything from
killing people to harming our envi-
ronment. This hands-off investing
practice is so common thathe didn't
tbink twice about it.
The campus community needs
to examine what the University
is investing in. There isn't space
to discuss these companies in any
great detail, but I encourage you
to research them. The products
and practices of Monsanto - the
agricultural biotechnology com-
pany - bave caused an incredible
amount of controversy. Here's one
outrageous tidbit: the company
patents its genetically engineered
seeds, surveys surrounding farms
and then sues the farmers who may
unknowingly have had their crop
contaminated by Monsanto seeds.

And the harm done to society by
Monsanto doesn't end there -btheir
health and environmental record is
questionable, to put it charitably.
British Petroleum's actions and
global impact probably don't need
to be introduced.
Tbe problem witb tbe Univer-
sity's investment in Northrop
Grumman also seems obvious
and is perhaps the most troubling.
Northrop Grumman makes weap-
ons. Weapons kill people. The
debate on this investment, as with
many-issues here on campus, has
been bogged down by bickering
about Israel and Palestine. Who is
killing whom is irrelevant. Some-
thing about benefitting from the
eventual death of human beings in
any way is inexcusable.
'U' needs to
consider
divestment.
Schools should be places that
drive societies forward. If posi-
tions of dissent and outrage aren't
fostered here, where will they
materialize? Who will fight corpo-
rate farming, hold oil companies
responsible and protest wars? Most
adults are too busy investing in
these processes to question them.
An essential part of this Univer-
sity's identity over the past fifty
years has been to advocate justice in
the face of wrongdoing. What these
investments mean is that not only is
this institution neglecting to foster
resistance to global atrocities, it's
perpetuating them. It is our duty as
paying students to hold the Univer-
sity accountable for its actions.
By investing in these corpora-
tions, our administration supports
the actions of Monsanto, BP and
Northrop Grumman - a horrify-
ing prospect to me. If we get to the
heart of the matter, the University's
motives and mindset are most like-
ly the same as my dad - to turn a
profit while ignoring the negative
implications of the investments. I
can understand (but don't support)
an individual owning a potentially
questionable mutual fund, but for
such a prosperous school with a
stronghistory of advocacy to know-
ingly invest in such companies is
absolutely unacceptable. The only
reasonable course of action for the
University is to immediately divest
from these companies.

Michigan has laws that shield
workers who use medicinal
marijuana from facing certain
legal repercussions. Accord-
ing to an April 27 article on
the ACLU website, Proposal 1,
passed by the state's voters in
2008, protects medical marijua-
na patients from "disciplinary
action by a business." A person
who uses marijuana obtained
with a medicinal card cannot
be discriminated against - and
yet that is exactly what Walmart
has done to Joseph Casias. This
case is clearly a symptom of the
prevailing negative perception
of marijuana, and Casias is pay-
ing the price for it.
In no other situation would
Casias be fired for using doctor-
prescribed medication. He was
using his medicine at home and

not at the workplace. If Casias
had back pains and was pre-
scribed painkillers to help him
sleep easier, a drug test reveal-
ing the presence of the drugs
in his bloodstream would give
Walmart no legal right to fire
him. In this case, the only dif-
ference is the medicine. The
stigma against marijuana should
not prevent those receiving
appropriate medical care from
employment.
Marijuana has been proven
time and time again to relieve
various ailments and symptoms
such as glaucoma, pain and nau-
sea. Its legal evolution is going
to be complicated, but Casias's
case is clear. Applying any other
standard of doctor-prescribed
druguse would show that Casias
is in the right. Though a negative

social attitude towards marijua-
na exists, it should not interfere
with the treatment of patients.
Michigan has been a leader
in pushing for the legalization
of marijuana for medicinal use,
and if it fills in the legal pot-
holes it will thoroughly expand
individual rights and medicinal
treatment. Joseph Casias was
prescribed legal treatment and
is being punished for it. The
state could save everyone a lot
of time and grief if it were to
forgo this wishy-washy legal-
ity and completely legalize
the drug. This would be a true
accomplishment for the rights
of individuals. In the meantime,
Michigan must fix its ambiguous
marijuana laws to prevent situa-
tions like this from arising in the
future.

Osama bin Laden is dead, but
I'm not exactly sure what that
means to me. As I listened to the
uproar outside my window last
night it seemed that campus had a
much clearer idea of what it meant
to them. Passersby erupted in
cheers and chants of "U.S.A." and
the only thing I really knew was
that I felt nothing like they did. My
first reaction was it was a shame
we didn't capture him, but accord-
ing to Obama, "justice has been
done". What have we achieved by
killing Osama bin Laden - and
has justice really been served?
When I saw the reports of jubi-
lation on the White House lawn
and other places across the coun-
try, I immediately felt ashamed.
Death may even be too kind of a
punishment for bin Laden, but
what are we doing celebrating his
death? A May 2 Michigan Daily
article told of Unviersity students
singing"Hail to the Victors" at the
White House. I cannot even begin
to address the stupidity and lack
of correlation between Michigan
and bin Laden, unless the Navy
Seal who plugged him was an
alum. Does our Wolverine hubris
know no bounds? His death is a
symbol not of success or justice
but of vengeance. The celebra-
tions immediately reminded me
of those of the Fallujah residents
who murdered the four Blackwa-
ter contractors and the rapture of
the Somalians who paraded the
bodies of the Blackhawk pilots in
Mogadishu.
There is a famous quote from
Confucius that says, "Before you
embark on a journey of revenge,
dig two graves" - except in the
case of bin Laden we should have
dug a few hundred thousand. I
hardly think that by killing one
person we have achieved an equi-
table response to the devastating
terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 or
the other bombings bin Laden is
responsible for. And if equity is
what we're looking for, the U.S.
has surpassed the attacks 100-

fold. Hundreds of thousands of
Iraqi civilians have died since the
invasion of Iraq and more Ameri-
can soldiers have died in Afghani-
stan and Iraq than the amount of
Americans killed on Sept. 11 The
world is probably a better place
without bin Laden, but it has also
paid a heavy price for his death. I
can't say it has been worth it. Our
arrogance and our brazen quest to
achieve vengeance have left the
world scarred, and with his death,
little has changed. Al-Qaida still
exists and terrorism is still a real
threat.
And what are we thinking bury-
ing him in the ocean? The New
York Times reported that it's Mus-
lim tradition to bury a body within
24 hours of its death, but that can-
not be the reason we dumped him
in the Arabian Sea. We invaded
Afghanistan and Iraq, bombed
Pakistan with drone strikes, shot
bin Laden in the head and sud-
denly we care about honoring his
carcass in the Muslim tradition?
His version of Islam is a perver-
sion anyway - maybe we should
have done him a favdr and given
him a good Christian burial. Not
to mention that this sea burial is
ammo for conspiracy theorists,
an easy opportunity for people to
claim that bin Laden is actually
still alive. We could have at least
waited to decide what to do with
his body before we sent it to Davy
Jones' Locker.
Osama bin Laden is dead, but
the world is still full of threats
home and abroad. A little restraint
in our celebrations might also
have preserved what little politi-
cal clout the U.S. has left. Rather
than rejoicing in elation, the U.S.
should be reflecting on the past 10
years. We should collect ourselves
- and when we realize that our
situation hasn't changed, we need
to make sure we proceed with a
better direction in the future.
Teddy Papes is the
editorial page editor.

Amy Chua, known as the
"Tiger Mom", scared many well-
to-do parents by claiming that
they're soft for
letting their
kids have slum-
ber parties.
David Brooks, "
a journalist for
The New York
Times, claims
the contrary -
- Amy Chua ERIK
is soft for let- TORENBERG
ting her kids
hide behind the -
comfort of their
math homework.
"Managing status rivalries,
negotiating group dynamics,
understanding social norms, nav-
igating the distinction between
self and group - these and other
social tests impose cognitive
demands that blow away any
intense tutoring session or class
at Yale," Brooks writes in a Jan.
17 column called "Amy Chau Is a
Wimp."
While Brooks may argue that a
college party is more cognitively
demanding than a night study-
ing in the library, this isn't to say
a night at Rick's is a bastion for
intellectual growth but that social
intelligence -is the essence of per-
sonal and professional success.
We recognize people who are
socially astute - who's "with it".
Although it may take many forms,
these people succeed in the fol-
lowing areas:
First, they understand them-
selves. We can sense when a per-
son's identity is defined through
approval from others and when
a person hasn't done enough self-
exploration to understand their
biological and cultural disposi-
tions - what subjects and activi-
ties they naturally thrive in and
what people they are naturally
compatible with. Socially intelli-
gent people typically understand

their deep motivations and how
their upbringing has helped in
constructing their personal nar-
rative.
As Brooks writes, "It's much
easier to change your envi-
ronment than to change your
insides." The socially intelligent
person coordinates his environ-
ment with his inclinations. He
matches what he does and who
he spends his time with what he's
good at and who he has fulfilling
connections with, regardless of
geography. And so he puts him-
self in an environment, physically
and emotionally, that pushes him
to be the best version of himself -
because to be yourself is just stu-
pid (what if you're a jerk?).
Our ideal individual also
understands relationships are
everything. He understands the
subtleties of building and sus-
taining relationships and on what
foundations those connections
rest. He puts himself in situations
where these connections are
most likely to occur, and avoids
situations where they won't.
Each person's emotional nour-
ishment is different. Some are
naturally more gregarious, able
to befriend many people while
maintaining their individuality.
Others are more reserved, prefer-
ring more time with fewer people.
All that matters is that our social-
ly skilled person is genuine. Peo-
ple trust him. They respect him.
And ideally, he inspires them.
But that's just my view. Brooks
used his own vocabularyto deter-
mine a social skill set, but his
overarching implication is that
human capital should not be mea-
sured solely on IQ or standardized
tests. For purposes of building
any team or organization, per-
haps companies and schools will
think of other ways to evaluate its
applicants. Perhaps in the future
moms will drop their kids off
at metis practice. (According to

Brooks, metis is "the ability to see
patterns in the world and derive a
gist from complex situations.") Or
a job interview will focus on test-
ing one's equipoise - or, accord-
ing to Brooks, "the ability to
serenely monitor the movements
of one's own mind and correct for
biases and shortcomings."
These skills typically receive
little attention, unless in some
vague, trite way. Imagine a pro-
spective college student asking a
tour guide how he can become a
better listener. It's often assumed
we learn these things on our own,
and there's a reason for that.
Can you imagine a minor in self-
exploration or a program in lead-
ership?
Success is also
based on social
intelligence.
Well, as it turns out, the latter
exists. The Barger Leadership
Institute within Organization
Studies is leading some exciting
experiments and plans to teach
a course on leadership next fall.
They're not the first to believe
that these skills can be taught.
Numerous people have been try-
ing to break these skills down
into separate parts and teach
them, but have failed to focus
on technique and succeeded in
building habits to internalize
such skills.
Perhaps I'll explore the how
in another article. Like Brooks,
I'm interested in this subject not
because it naturally comes easy
to me, but because it doesn't.

New award offers
creative writing
students money to
work after college
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Graduate students in the
University's creative writing
program have been given a gift
that students working their way
through college seldom receive
- the gift of time.
A new monetary gift from
Helen Zell and the Zell Fam-
ily Foundation will provide
$25,000 for one year of post-
graduate funding for graduates
of the University's Master of
Fine Arts in Creative Writing
Program, allowing former stu-
dents to complete work started
during the course of earning
their degrees.
Eileen Pollack, the pro-
gram's director and a professor
in the department of English
Language and Literature, said
students in the MFA Creative
Writing Program qualify for
post-graduate funding if they
have high academic standing
and plan to stay in Ann Arbor
while they produce finished
pieces.
Pollack said the fund will
exist as a three-year experi-
ment, starting for the class of
2012 and ending in 2014. She
added that the additional fund-
ing is expected to increase inter-
est in the already successful
program..
"Because of the generosity
of our donors and the Univer-
sity and our wonderful faculty,
we've kind of worked our way
up to become one of the top two
MFA programs in the country -
out of hundreds and hundreds
of them," Pollack said. "So we're
very proud ofthat."
The MFA Creative Writ-
ing Program was established
in the late 1980's, but the pro-
gram didn't begin offering post-
graduate funding until 1999,
when Hendrik Meijer and the
Meijer Corporation established
the Meijer Fellowship. In 2007,
Helen Zell gave the program
funding to expand its post-grad-
uate aid to endow five graduates

a year.
Pollack said the generous dona-
tions give the program an advan-
tage over others and the gift from
the Zell family will provide the
program with an "edge" in recruit-
ing new students in the future.
There are currently 22 students
in each graduating class - 12 fic-
tion writers and 10 poets - all of
whom receive financial aid pack-
ages amounting to $8,000 a
semester and $6,000 for summer
work, which covers the entirety of
their coursework expenses.
Pollack said the two-year
MFA Creative Writing Program
remains competitive against
three-year programs because the
funding allows graduates to con-
tinue the work they began in the
program for an additional year.
She added that some programs
policy to only give financial aid to
particular students didn't adhere
to their program's mission to sup-
port a writing community rather
than create cutthroat competition.
Daniel Keane, who just com-
pleted his first year in the MFA
Creative Writing Program, said
the addition to the Zell fellowship
improves the already nationally
acclaimed program.
"A really good thing about the
program here is that they're really
focused on our careers as writers,"
Keane said.
Keane said he plans to pursue
the funding in order to work on
his fiction for a third year, adding
that providing third-year funding
for all graduates will solidify the
program's position as the top in
the country.
Megan Levad, assistant direc-
tor and 2008 graduate of the MFA
Creative Writing Program, was
one of three poets in the program
to receive post-graduate funding
from the Zell Fellowship.
Levad said she thinks the new
funding will help graduates of
the program better transition into
their careers by allowing them
additional time to create a body
of work. Levad added that stu-
dents in the MFA program grow
together creatively and that pro-
viding funding will foster support
among graduates when they need
it the most.
"One of the great things about it
being available to everyone is that
they will now have real continuity
as a writing community," Levad
said.

Student kicked out of organizations because of ties to Order

Chatoris Jones
removed from
leadership positions
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily News Editor
After accepting a tap to join
Order of Angell - an exclusive
senior honor society previously
known as Michigamua - LSA
senior Chatoris Jones was forced
to step down from his leadership
positions in both the Black Stu-
dent Union and Intellectual Minds
Making a Difference organiza-
tions.
Theconstitutionsofbothgroups
have clauses that prohibit mem-
bers from holding executive posi-
tions if they partake in Order due
to its historically discriminatory
past. Order has been criticized for
its use of Native American culture,
including its former name that was
changed in 2007 and its engage-
ment in Native American rituals
that the group ceased following a

1989 agreement.
Vidhi Bamzai, Order of Angell
spokesperson and Public Policy
senior, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that the clauses the groups
have in their constitutions man-
dating the removal of individuals
affiliated with Order is unjustified
and ultimately negatively affects
the quality of student groups and
campus life.
"The point that Order of Angell
is discriminatory is false," Bamzai
said. "Rather, Order is one of the
most diverse organizations on
campus, bringing together stu-
dent leaders from across campus
and bridging gaps between gender,
religion, ethnicity, background
and sexual orientation."
She added that while Order has
a history of discrimination against
Native Americans, the group
strives to be transparent and sep-
arate itself from "its antiquated,
yet tumultuous history as Mich-
igamua."
Jones said he was aware that
BSU - a group that sponsors pro-
grams related to African heritage

and culture - would be upset he
decided to join Order, but despite
this was still disappointed the
group asked him to leave after
working together for three years.
"I'm upset that I have to leave
an organization I've been a part of
since freshman year," Jones said.
"It's like the work I've done has
been overlooked."
BSU spokeswoman Saman-
tha Martin explained that Jones
was asked to step down from his
position as treasurer in the group
because his actions violated BSU's
constitution and that they provide
no exceptions to their policy.
"As an organization, we don't
support any affiliation with the
Order" Martin said. "Therefore,
any members associated with
Order cannot be part of BSU."
Intellectual Minds Making a
Difference -- an organization that
mentors disadvantaged youth in
Detroit - also asked Jones to leave
his position as co-chair. Jones said
he is still allowed to be involved
with the group, but cannot hold
a leadership position because the

group believes his affiliation with
Order will affect campus partici-
pation in Black Welcome Week,
an event that seeks to assist black
freshman with adjusting to life at
the University.
IMMAD could not be reached
for comment as of yesterday eve-
ning.
Jones said he believes there are
many problems that need to be
addressed pertaining to relations
among campus groups, adding that
he joined Order because he views
the group as a way to mediate dia-
logue about issues between orga-
nizations on campus.
He added that many depart-
ments at the University have been
supportive of Jones and his deci-
sion to fight against his removal
from leadership positions in BSU
and IMMAD, including the Office
of Academic Multicultural Initia-
tives.
John Matlock, executive direc-
tor for the Office of Academic
Multicultural Initiatives, met with
Jones on Thursday to discuss the
situation and offer his support.

Matlock said the department has
dealt with similar issues before,
addingthat Jones's case is difficult
because it doesn't fit the "clear-
cut" definition of discrimination
in federal law or University policy.
Matlock said he strongly
encourages increased dialogue
surrounding conflicts that arise
between campus organizations.
"There's going to be a bigger
discussion over the summer ...
We'll look at the ramifications and
how students are impacted based
on what groups they're involved
with," he said.
According to Jones, Order of
Angell has been very supportive
of his decision to overturn his
removal from the organizations,
with members of the society offer-
ing to walk him to class to provide
additional security.
"They have backed me like a
long-time friend," Jones said.
- Because of her membership
in the Order of Angell, Editor
in Chief Stephanie Steinberg
did not edit this story.

CITY COUNCIL
City passes panhandling amendment From Page 2

Panhandling banned
near venues withp
owner's permission
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
In an attempt to cut down on
the amount of panhandlers in the
community, the Ann Arbor City
Council unanimously approved an
amendment to the city ordinance
on panhandling that requires solic-
itors to have formal permission to
be on city property.
The amendment states that
solicitors must now have consent
from property owners to solicit on
the premises and will ban solicita-
tion without permission in places
including alleys, buses, parking
structures, banks and in front of
ATMs.
Without permission from the
owner of specified areas, the solici-
tation will be considered "unlaw-
ful" and an act of "disorderly
conduct," according to the amend-
ment.
City Council member Sabra Bri-

ere (D-Ward 1) said the amend-
ment was passed in order to allow
for easier police enforcement of the
panhandlers.
Briere, who serves as chair of
the panhandling task force that
was developed in September 2010
to decrease the number of panhan-
dlers in the area, said the group
plans to meet with merchants and
students to discuss the changes to
the ordinance and has already talk-
ed with various panhandlers.
"We had a lot of discussion back
and forth about how it would apply
and I think we, as a task force, did
not take a repressive attitude," Bri-
ere said.
Amid difficult economic times
for both the state and city, Bri-
ere said City Council ensured the
amendment was within the city's
means by avoiding increasing the
amount of law enforcement per-
sonnel.
"The budget isn't flexible enough
to allow an increased number of
police on the street," Briere said.
"We were all aware of that."
Briere said police are able to
enforce the amendment if they are
called to an incident involving a

solicitor. She added that increased
awareness among police officers
and community members of issues
like panhandling will help defuse
the problem because of the varied
areas of concentrated complaints.
"We're not looking at arrests
here, what we're looking at is alittle
more control," she said.
Additionally, Briere said that
she encourages people to donate to
organizations that help the disad-
vantaged rather than giving money
to the panhandlers and encourag-
ing their actions.
Gwyddion Storm - a panhandler
holding a sign that read "Mental ill-
ness NOT addiction keeps me job-
less" on East Liberty Street outside
of Borders - said he understands
why the ordinance is in place and
does not support aggressive pan-
handling. Despite this, he is against
City Council's amendment because
he believes they are attempting to
"outlaw homelessness."
He added that panhandlers
should not be punished for being
unobtrusive and are instead prac-
ticing their first amendment rights.
"This is freedom of speech,"
Storm said.

further commentary on the
matter was postponed.
The council also questioned
references in the ordinance to
the difference between home
occupations and commercial cul-

tivation facilities in zoning areas.
Despite the differences, the limit
of marijuana plants that can be
grown in the city totals 72.
Multiple word rephrasing and
changes to the regulations docu-
ment were also made, and the
council determined that any fur-
ther amendments would be dis-
cussed at a later time.

15th century Venice comes to life in Special Collections

printed?
Hatcher Graduate Library's
"Watermarks From Venice Exhib-
it" aims to answer these questions
and more through a display that
features actual artifacts of printing
done in Venice during the second
half of the 15th century, as well as
books from the University's Spe-
cial Collections Library's vast col-
lection produced during that time.
Starting in the latter half of the
15th century, Venice was the place
to be for the printing industry.
Printers were coming in from all
over Europe to be a part of what
was happening in the water-filled
city.

Assistant librarian for Shapiro
Science Library and coordinator
for the theme semester, Rebecca
Hill, said this exhibit fits well with
the overall theme of Winter 2011 -
water.
"When people think of Venice,
they think of canals and gondolas
even if they've never been there
before," Hill said. "Water is a part
of its history. When people think
Venice, they'll think water, so we
wanted to highlight the role books
played in the city."
After being approached by Hill
to create an exhibit that incorpo-
rated water and special collection
books, Outreach Librarian and

Curator for Special Collections
Library Pablo Alvarez put together
the "Watermarks" exhibit.
"It's a nice experience to have
all these different media on display
to learn about how this technol-
ogy worked," he said. "Until you
understand how much isinvolved
in making a whole book, it is very
difficult to visualize what is really
in play and involved before print-
ing any book."
There are four different Vene-
tian printers- represented in the
exhibit, all of which brought some-
thing new and innovative. One of
them integrated printed graphics
that were usually hand-colored.

Another included highly detailed
woodblock ornaments around
the text. A particularly inventive
printer developed the idea of a
small pocket-sized book as well as
the font now known as italics.
The focus of the display is to
illustrate what the printers were
able to do to make their work reach
millions rather than displaying the
actual information presented in
them.
"The exhibit is not about the
content of the books," Alvarez said.
"It's about the production of them,
how printers and publishers played
a very important role in the dis-
semination of ideas."

'Blues' hits temark

Fleet Foxes' second
album masters the art
of helplessness
By JOSHUA BAYER
Daily Arts Writer
To call the Fleet Foxes a "renais-
sance band" would not be far off
the mark. The

Foxes' stately
blend of folk jam-
mery (complete
with jaw-drop-
ping, four-part
harmonies) cer-
tainly reads as
a throwback to
the golden days
of late-'60s folk-

Fleet Foxes
Helpless-
ness Blues
Sub Pop

Shrine/An Argument" shifts from
acoustic reverie to surging crash
cymbal-ridden anthem to plaintive
pseudo-acapella to abrasive free-
jazz noise outro that will likely
scare the crap out of you the first
time you hear it.
While the rest of the record is
decidedly less epic (save for action-
packed five-minute suite "The
Plains/Bitter Dancer"), the free-
wheeling aesthetic is prominent
throughout. "Sim Sala Bim" fronts
as a sparse rainy-day folk number,
before abruptly piling on a deluge
of Herculean strings, deciding
two minutes in to drop the vocals
entirely and storm out with a brisk
shuffle of unplugged guitar calis-
thenics. Centerpiece "Helplessness
Blues" bucks verse-chorus-verse in
a less jittery fashion, literally pick-
ing up electricity halfway through
as it melts away into an aching
three-guitar whorl.
As a result, the band's sec-
ond studio album feels inevita-
bly heavier than its predecessor.
Where Fleet Foxes succeeded as
an airtight collection of retro-
chic pop powerhouses, Blues suc-
ceeds as a breathtaking series of
sonic adventures. Vocal-less "The
Cascades," with its progressively
plucked arpeggios and cavernous
tambourine rattles, feels more akin
to the score of a pirate film than to
anything off the band's debut. Even
"Battery Kinzie," the record's most
straightforward pop offering, feels
compelled to open with the lyrics,
"I woke up one morning / all my
fingers rotten / I woke up a dying
man without a chance."

While Blues may lack the rela-
tively sunny-side-up pulse of Foxes,
its baroque melodies retain the
same heart-stopping gorgeousness.
"Bedouin Dress" and "Lorelai" are
perfect examples of how the Foxes
have expanded upon their signa-
ture sound without remotely for-
saking it. The former folds a Celtic
fiddle riff seamlessly into its buoy-
ant hop while the latter summons
jazzy vibraphone tinkles to flesh
out its aquatically rippling texture.
Both songs exemplify the band's
ability to channel its experimen-
tal impulses toward atmospheric
enhancement rather than spacey
indulgence.
Just for good measure, the group
throws in a handful of relatively
understated songs. Opener "Mont-
ezuma" sets the record's tone per-
fectly with its gently submerged
beauty, showcasing the Foxes' eerie
ability to craft a sound that is full-
er than that of virtually any other
indie band out there with little
more than a couple of guitars and
melt-in-your-mouth vocal harmo-
nies. And "Someone You'd Admire"
and "Blue Spotted Tail" both spin
pure ear candy from the no-frills
troubadour template, the latter
even ditching the reverb complete-
ly for a refreshing moment of vul-
nerability.
Helplessness Blues undeniably
takes a few listens to settle in, but
when it does, the experience is
borderline religious. While it cer-
tainly isn't going to be the feel-
good record of 2011, it's the closest

more than the sum of its nostal-

with oodles of requisite reverb and
prickling with Gen-Y ennui, the
band's sound is unquestionably a
product of the 21st century. While
the Foxes' rustic guitar balladry
may radiate with a sunny naivete,
an uncanny sense of ghostly intro-
spection seeps through the cracks.
With the aptly titled Helpless-

'M' swept with back-to-back walk-off finishes

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - Some members
of the Michigan baseball team col-
lapsed to the infield dirt at Ohio
State's Bill Davis Stadium on Satur-
day. Others
just put their MICHIGAN 2
hands atop OHIO STATE 7
their heads
with expres- MICHIGAN 6

seemed to
indicate they
had seen this MICHIGAN 3
before. OHIO STATE 4
Theyhad.
In all three games of the Wol-
verines' series against Ohio State
(9-6 Big Ten, 19-18 overall), Michi-
gan jumped out to a lead in the first
inning. In all three games, the-Wol-
verines let the Buckeyes get right
back in it
After losing Friday's opener 7-2,
Michigan (6-9, 13-28) fought back
after falling behind or squandering
a lead in both games of Saturday's
double header. They lost both con-
tests - 7-6 in the first, 4-3 in the
nightcap.
Both in extra innings.
It was dsja vu.
The defeated expressions on the
faces of the players and coaches said
it all. It was the look of a team that
had victory within its grasp twice

in the double header Saturday, only
to watch its archrival sprint onto
the field in celebration two different
times. The sweep was Ohio State's
first over Michigan in 15 years.
"I don'tthink many people can say
that they've lost in extras on walk-
off plays like that," redshirt senior
Anthony Toth said. "It's just heart-
breaking because there's no one that
was here today that can question
anybody's heart or passion."
An infield single wasthe dagger in
the first game Saturday. Sophomore
shortstop Derek Dennis made an
acrobatic diving grab on a grounder
by redshirt senior third baseman
Matt Streng, but he had no chance
at a throw and the winning run
crossed the plate. Had the hit been
a foot more towards Dennis, the
inningwould have ended.
In the-nightcap, just a few inches
decided the game. Greg Solomon
smashed a double in the tenth inning,
just out of the reach of sophomore
center fielder Patrick Biondi. Biondi
managed to knock the ball down, but
was inches away from a spectacular
catch. The next batter grounded to
Dennis, who threw to third instead
of getting the out at first. The throw
was wide of junior third baseman
John Lorenz, and Solomon came
around for the Buckeyes' second
consecutive walk-off.
"I thought Derek Dennis played
a marvelous shortstop," Michi-

gan coach Rich Maloney said. "It's
unfortunate he was playing to win,
tried to make a play. My instinct,
and I'm a shortstop, was the same
instinct that he had."
But Michigan had plenty of
opportunities to win. After surren-
dering a one-run lead in the eighth
inning of the first game Saturday,
the Wolverines capitalized on two
of Ohio State's six errors and went
ahead 6-3 in the ninth behind junior
left fielder Coley Crank's two-run
home run. They gave all three runs
back the next half inning.
After the deflating loss, Michigan
was quiet for much of the nightcap
but came back from a two-run deficit
in the eighth to tie the game at three
apiece. The Wolverines looked like
they would do what the Buckeyes
did to them earlier that day: steal one
they should have lost.
Michigan had all the momen-
tum. Freshman right fielder Michael
O'Neill made a game-saving play
when he threw out redshirt Buckeye
right fielder Brian DeLucia at home
plate in the eighth inning.
In the end, none of it was enough.
"It hurts real bad if you're a Mich-
igan man," Maloney said. "It hurts to
lose period, and it hurts to lose three
games to your rival. On top of it, los-
ing the way that we lost."
Freshman first baseman Josh
Dezse paced the Buckeyes the whole
series. His three-run home run in

the first inning in Friday's 7-2 Ohio
State victory was the difference in
the game.
Dezse went 6-for-10 on the series
with six RBI, and Michigan inten-
tionally walked him twice.
On the mound, Dezse also struck
out every batter he faced. He pitched
an inning on Friday and recorded
the win in one inning-of work in Sat-
urday's first game.
"He's killingthe ball," O'Neill said
of Dezse, his high-school teammate

and friend. "That's the best I've ever
seen him play."
Just don't expect O'Neill to take
much solace in the fact that his
friend is the one celebrating a series
victory that could have easily gone to
the Wolverines.
"It's-going to be 'a long bus ride
home," O'Neill said. "When you lose
two games in extra innings, when
you're one hit away, one play away
from taking the series, and then you
just got swept ... it sucks."

Trio of losses a harsh homecoming for three Michigan players

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - This weekend
had been circled in red ink on Michi-
gan's calendar for a longtime.
It wasn't just a series with the
capability of becoming a turning
point to separate two teams tied
for fourth in the congested Big Ten
standings. It was Michigan and Ohio
State. The rivalry.
But for three Wolverines, it wasn't
just about facing their bitter rivals; it
was a homecoming.
And given Michigan's outcome,
it made the losses - two of which
came in back-to-back double-header
fashion in extra innings - that much
harder to swallow.
"It sucks, especially to those
guys," freshman rightfielder
Michael O'Neill said of the losses.
Fifth-year senior captain and
second baseman Anthony Toth - a
native of suburban Cleveland - was

a lifelong Buckeye fan until the Wol-
verines offered him a chance to play
college baseball, something Ohio
State didn't offer.
Sophomore shortstop Derek Den-
nis was born in Ohio and grew up a
Buckeye fan until moving to Michi-
gan when he was seven.
But neither was as excited to
returnto their home state as O'Neill.
O'Neill, who grew up in the shadows
of the Ohio State campus, has been
talking for weeks about returning
home to play in front of friends, fam-
ily and most notably, against his best
friend: Buckeye freshman first base-
man and pitcher Josh Dezse.
But it was a Dezse-led Ohio
State squad that got the best of the
Wolverines. Dezse went 6-for-10
with six RBI, including a three-run
homer over O'Neill in right field. He
also closed out two games, striking
out all six batters he faced.
"(Dezse) had an unbelievable
weekend, so props to him," O'Neill

said. "He played phenomenal. That's
the best I've ever seen him play."
Added Michigan coach Rich
Maloney: "You've got to give Josh
Dezse a tremendous amount ofcred-
it. If he's not the (Big Ten) Player of
the Week, then I don't know who is."
Though O'Neill hit just 2-for-13
on the weekend, things weren't all
bad for the right fielder.
His fifth-inning single in the first
game of the Saturday double header
evened the score at two, and he later
scored the game-tying run in the
eighth inning of the nightcap.
Then in the bottom-half of the
eighth, a two-out single into right
field prompted Ohio State's manager
to send home his lead-off man, Brian
DeLucia, from second. But O'Neill
showed off his rocket-for-an-arm,
gunning down DeLucia at home for
the final out of the inning.
But when O'Neill reached base in
the 10th inning of the same game,
he was caught stealing to end the

inning with junior catcher Coley
Crank - the Wolverines' most pro-
ductive hitter - left standing in the
batter's box without a chance to play
hero. Ohio State scored the next
inningto complete the sweep.
Toth - playing in his last career
series against the Buckeyes - made
two of his team-leading nine errors
on Saturday. An error in game one of
the double header led to an unearned
run by Ohio State in a game it went
on to win by one. Junior third base-
man John Lorenz fielded a grounder
and threw to second to try to get the
lead runner, but Toth dropped the
ball. The runner later scored, allow-
ing the Buckeyes to tie the game
enteringthe ninth.
But no one struggled more than
sophomore shortstop Derek Den-
nis. Dennis was just 1-for-13 from
the plate with eightstrikeouts, while
leaving seven men on base.
"Yeah, that was rough," Maloney
said. "He did struggle."

But the most notable moment
from Dennis over the weekend
didn't come from the plate. It came
from the shortstop position, where
he was otherwise spectacular. With
one out and a runner on third in the
bottom of the 10th inning in the
series finale, Dennis fielded a routine
grounder. Instead of throwing to
first for the second out, he rushed his
throw to try to get the lead runner
out at third. The throw went astray.
Moments later, the Buckeyes
were celebrating on the field while
a stunned Dennis was left sitting,
hanging his head to avoid watching
the celebrating that ensued from his
error.
For the three players that hail
from Ohio, they couldn't leave the
state any sooner. But the outcomes of
three games have the ability to turn
a three-hour drive into an eternity.
"As much as it sucks, this is going
to be a long bus ride home," O'Neill
said.

Michigan loses heartbreaker

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
The stage was set for a Big Ten
Tournament title for the Michigan
women's tennis team.
The 10th-ranked Wolverines
were playing on their home courts,
fresh off of their second consecu-
tive Big Ten regular-season cham-
pionship. They sailed through the
conference slate with a perfect 10-0
record and cruised through their
first two rounds of action in the
Big Ten Tournament, beating both
Minnesota and Ohio State by 4-0
scores.
And even with cloudy skies,
whirling winds and a light drizzle,
a packed crowd was gathered to
watch Michigan take on its rival No.
17 Northwestern in the tournament
championship.
But after taking a dominant 3-0
lead against the Wildcats, Michigan
stumbled and collapsed as North-
western clawed its way back to
defeat the Wolverines 4-3 and win
the Big Ten Tournament title.
"It's a tough one, for sure, to
swallow," Michigan coach Ronni
Bernstein said. "We won a really
close doubles point, won two sin-
gles, (and) got up 3-0. You got four
matches there and you hope you can
pull one out."
The inclement weather seemed
to be an ominous sign for the Wol-
verines. All three doubles teams got
off to rocky starts and faced deficits
late in their matches. Michigan also
faced an early hole after freshman
Sam Critser and senior Mimi Nguy-

en lost a contested match 8-6.
But the Wolverines' fortunes
appeared to turn. Seniors Whitney
Taney and Rika Tatsuno wheeled
off four straight games to win their
match 8-5.
Senior Denise Muresan and
freshman Brooke Bolender climbed
back from a 6-4 deficit to tie their
match at 7-7.
Muresan and Bolender soon
took control of their match, as their
Northwestern counterparts unrav-
eled.
Muresan and Bolender's valiant
effort paid off as they won their
match 9-7, giving the Wolverines
confidence and a 1-0 lead over the
Wildcats.
Micligan seemed primed to end
Northwestern's 12-year reign as Big
Ten Tournament champions after
Taney and Tastuno both breezed
through their singles matches, 6-0,
6-0 and 6-1, 6-3, respectively. But
just as the sun started to shine, so
did Northwestern's confidence.
Nguyen and Critser were both
ousted in straight sets. The one-set
advantages that both Bolender and
Muresan possessed in their match-
es vanished and gave way to doubt,
as both players lost in three sets.
"We just, mentally and physi-
cally, were not in those third sets,"
Bernstein said. "I think physically
they were a little bit better today at
the end.
"They had more gas in the tank
and (were) just way more positive.
You've got to be strong mentally to
pull out matches like that."
After dominating the first set

with powerful groundstrokes and
consistent serves, No. 7 Muresan
began to lose her composure after
falling behind early in the second
set to No. 13 Maria Mosolova.
Following a half-hearted come-
back, Muresan's emotions took
over. She sprayed several unforced
errors and earned herself two rack-
et-throwing violations on her way
to a disheartening6-2,3-6,1-6 loss.
But there was still hope for the
Wolverines. Bolender battled to a
2-1 lead in the third set against fel-
low freshman Belinda Niu, beau-
tifully finishing off points at the
net. But even as Niu appeared to be
fatigued, she found the strength to
overpower Bolender and win the
next five games for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-2
victory, setting off a frenzied cel-
ebration by the Wildcats.
"Hand it to Northwestern," Ber-
nstein said. "They took the match.
They were willing to be more
aggressive and that's the way you're
going to win the match. They did it
and we didn't."
Bernstein remained optimis-
tic for her team, suggesting that
the loss could make Michigan that
much more stronger as they prepare
for a deep run in the NCAA Tourna-
ment.
"They're disappointed," Bern-
stein said. "They wanted to do this,
especially on their home courts
(and) in front of our crowd.
"But we're going to learn from it
and hopefully we'll be stronger in
these situations and be able to them
out. Maybe this could be a good
wake-up call."
