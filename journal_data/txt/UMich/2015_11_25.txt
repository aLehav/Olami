GOVERNMENT

Surgeries resume 

after contamination 
caused cancellations, 

postponements

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–

Dearborn) sent an inquiry Mon-
day to the director of tzxzhe VA 
Ann Arbor Healthcare System 
regarding dozens of surgeries 
for veterans that were cancelled 
or rescheduled in the past few 
weeks because of a potential 
equipment contamination.

Though concerns with ster-

ilization of surgical equipment 
were also raised in 2014, Dingell 
said in an interview Tuesday that 
she recently began receiving calls 
from 
concerned 
constituents 

about what appears to be a simi-
lar issue.

According to Derek Atkinson, 

a public affairs official for the 
Healthcare System, nurses at the 
hospital began noticing inorganic 

particulate matter several weeks 
ago on the cases containing sur-
gical equipment that had previ-
ously been sterilized. The system 
has been working to determine 
the cause and solve the problem 
since that time.

“Our O.R. nurses, as part of 

their normal inspection process 
perhaps, would notice one of 
these little micro particulates. 
Essentially — just to kind of give 
you an idea of what you’re look-
ing at — it’s almost like a speck 
of pepper in the case that would 
house the equipment, but not on 
the equipment,” he said.

To rectify the situation, Atkin-

son said the Healthcare System 
opted for a “surgical stand-down” 
the week of Nov. 11 — cancelling 
and rescheduling veteran surger-
ies to later dates at the Healthcare 
System or at the University.

In Dingell’s letter to the 

Healthcare System, which fol-
lowed a phone call with Robert 
McDivitt, the hospital’s director, 
she posed several questions about 
actions the hospital is taking to 
address the situation and ensure

Michigan does not 

restrict sale to minors

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 75 percent of teens 

and 
adults 
say 
e-cigarettes 

should carry restrictions similar 

to traditional cigarettes, accord-
ing to a C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital National Poll on Chil-
dren’s Health published Nov. 16.

Commonly known as vap-

ing, e-cigarettes simulate the 
feeling of smoking a traditional 
cigarette. The battery-powered 
device delivers nicotine, which 
is often flavored, as well as other 

chemicals in the form of vapor 
rather than smoke.

Matthew Davis, professor of 

pediatrics and internal medicine 
and director of the National Poll 
on Children’s Health, said the 
poll asked teens aged 13 to 18, as 
well as their parents, about their 
attitudes 
toward 
e-cigarettes 

and what they thought would be 

approporiate for regulating the 
devices.

Currently, few restrictions 

exist with on how e-cigarettes 
are marketed.

“These 
(potential) 
restric-

tions would entail the prohibi-
tion of e-cigarette use in public 
spaces that would be similar to

BUSINESS

Piada aims to 
attract students 

through fast-
causal model

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Five Guys is out and one Ital-

ian restaurant is moving in.

Piada Italian Street Food is 

set to open in spring 2016 on 
State Street in the former home 
of Five Guys Burgers and Fries. 
The burger shop closed in June 
after financial troubles, and the 
building has been vacant since. 
Piada currently operates in two 
cities in Michigan, as well as in 
a number of other states. 

Matt Eisenacher, director of 

marketing for Piada, said Ann 
Arbor was an attractive city for 
the restaurant brand to expand 
into for two main reasons.

“Ann Arbor is just a good 

food community, a good food 
culture,” Eisenacher said. “The 
community really appreciates 
good food and seeks better food 

options. Two, we just heard 
from a lot of people as we moved 
into Michigan — and obviously 
we’re in Toledo and Cleveland 
as well — we just kept hearing 
‘Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, Ann 
Arbor’ over and over again so 
really we just had our eyes so 
I’m finding the perfect site.”

In addition to Ann Arbor food 

culture, Eisenacher believes the 
business will thrive because of 
the city’s young residents.

“Especially younger genera-

tions are looking to put more 
of their fingerprint on the food 
that they’re choosing,” he said. 
“They like the fact that they 
can choose what goes into their 
meal, and two, they like the 
fresher options. The younger 
generation realizes they can get 
better food without having to 
empty their pockets for it. We 
seek to provide fresh or food at 
an affordable price and obvious-
ly I think that’s something that 
appeals to college students.”

Residents earn extra 
income by cashing in 

on bottle deposits

By GIANCARLO BUONOMO

Daily Arts Writer

Ann Arbor, on a football Sat-

urday, is one big party. Swarms 
of 
maize-and-blue-clad 
fans 

carouse on lawns and spill out 

into oncoming traffic. The air 
is thick with the aroma of char-
coal-grilled hot dogs and hor-
monal sweat. So thick, it seems 
to catch and hold cellphone sig-
nals like flies in a web. Everyone 
drinks a Great Lakes’ worth of 
beer, vodka, tequila, boxed wine 
and more beer, until it’s time to 
head in a mass exodus to the sta-
dium.

After they leave, it’s a ghost 

town. Plastic bags drift along 
like tumbleweeds. Thousands of 
beer cans litter the streets, over-
flow from garbage barrels and 
fill giant, leaking bags on the 
sidewalk. But by sundown, most 
of these cans will be gone.

A small economy, a culture 

even, springs up in Ann Arbor on 
football Saturdays. Each game 
day, dozens of individuals can-

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

There’s a new Thanksgiving tradition. Dubbed “friendsgiving,” the occasion allows friends to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday together a few days ahead of the 
traditional family feast. In recent years, the unofficial holiday has become increasingly popular, especially among millennials. LSA senior Breah Dean hosted a gath-

ering for a group of six friends, who met last semester while studying abroad in Switzerland. “There was one guy in our group. I ran into him on the street and we 

talked for like five minutes,” LSA senior Marissa Henry said. “And then Breah came, and happened to run into us, too. And then we got really excited because it’s very 

rare that we all see each other randomly so we thought, ‘Friendsgiving, let’s do it. Everyone’s doing it, we all like food, no one’s gonna say no.’ ”

Daily Staff Reporter

The University will conduct its 

second annual Giving Blueday on 
Tuesday, a 24-hour event during 
which students and alumni are 
encouraged to donate to campus 
organization and programs. 

The event is a spinoff of Giv-

ing Tuesday, a global movement 
dedicated to philanthropy and 
giving back to communities and 
is inspired by Black Friday events. 

“When it comes to philan-

thropy, Michigan students are no 
strangers to accomplishing great 
things,” wrote E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for student life, in 
an e-mail about the event to the 
student body Tuesday. “From

Q & A: Professor to attend UN 
Climate Conference in Paris

Faculty and 

students to join 
observational 

delegation Nov. 30

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Paul Edwards, a professor in 

the School of Information and the 
Department of History, is a mem-
ber of the University’s observa-
tional delegation that will attend 
the United Nations 2015 Climate 
Change Conference in Paris from 
Nov. 30 through Dec. 11. Edwards, 
along with two other faculty mem-
bers, was responsible for selecting 
the eight students who will join him 
in the delegation.

In a Q&A with The Michigan 

Daily, Edwards discussed his history 
with the conference, changes to the 
negotiation structure and the fact 
that, despite the terrorist attacks 

earlier this month that killed 130 in 
the region, the conference will still be 
held in Paris. The conference will be 
attended by world leaders including 
President Barack Obama.

The Conference began in 1992 

when countries signed an interna-
tional treaty for its creation. Their 
target goals, which include set limits 
on global temperature increases and 
greenhouse gas emmission reduc-
tion, have continued to change with 
each years’meeting. 

What is the significance and 

structure of the conference?
This is the 21st conference of 

parties to the framework conven-
tion on climate change that has 
been meeting every year since 
1995. The convention is essentially 
an agreement to agree — or try to 
agree — of the world’s nations. 
Back when it was signed in Rio in 
1992, all the parties to the conven-
tion said we will meet and negoti-
ate an agreement to stop climate 
change and adapt to its effects.

What is your history with the 

Climate Change Conference? 
Essentially the Kyoto Protocol 

was signed in (1997), but it was 
not actually enforced for (almost) 
another 10 years, until 2005. It’s 
been very weak and ineffective 
but at least it was something. In 
Copenhagen in 2009, which I also 
attended with the first U-M del-
egation, there was a lot of hope in 
Copenhagen that there would be 
a binding agreement coming out 
of that — it was right after Obama 
had been elected — but that has not 
happened. It’s billions of dollars 
that were pledged in Copenhagen 
that was never delivered and will 
never be delivered. The thing that 
did come out of Copenhagen was a 
kind of plan to keep the planetary 
warming to less than 2 degrees 
centigrade.

How has the conference 

changed?

There has been kind of a really 

important change in the way the 
whole association is structured. It 
used to be that the countries were 
grouped into various categories 
and then essentially assigned a 
sort of target that everyone would 
have to reach. It was more of a 
top-down approach, but this time, 
it’s much more bottom-up, where 
every country has put together 
its own independent, nationally 
determined contributions, which 
is basically a statement of what 
it’s planning to do to slow climate 
change and adapt to the effects.

Why aren’t you staying for 

the full conference?

A big feature of these confer-

ence meetings is that they have 
enormous side events of all kinds. 
Demonstrations and exhibitions 
by corporations and international 
organizations, all kinds of really 
interesting things happen that 
aren’t formally part of the meeting, 
but with the attacks, the govern-
ment is trying to discourage large 
gatherings. They cancelled most of 
these. Some of them will happen 
anyways — people will defy the 
police — hold those meetings no 
matter what, but it’s not prudent.

The delegation will discuss their 

experience Jan. 21 at North Quad. 

SAFE representatives call for 
dismissal of CSG member

Group deems Jesse 

Arm’s conduct 

inappropriate during 
Diag demonstration

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

At a Central Student Govern-

ment meeting Tuesday, repre-
sentatives from Students Allied 
for Freedom and Equality called 
on on the body to dismiss a 
representative for his conduct 
toward SAFE demonstrators on 
the Diag.

The demonstration occurred 

last Thursday and featured 
two 8-by-12-foot mock walls to 
represent the 25-foot security 
wall that separates Israel and 
the West Bank.

During the CSG meeting 

on Tuesday, SAFE members 
played a video of the interac-
tion between demonstrators 
and CSG representative Jesse 
Arm, an LSA sophomore.

“You’re not serious about 

this, with these signs here,” 
Arm said in the video. “It’s dis-
gusting. Take it down, you’re 
not serious.”

In the video, a member of 

SAFE said she would take 
down the mock wall when the 
real wall was taken down in 
Israel.

SAFE member Devin Jones, 

an LSA senior, said Arm was 
demonstrating conduct unbe-
coming of a regular student, let 
alone a CSG representative.

“For you to think you have 

some type of right to come 
up to us and vent in that way 
is irresponsible,” Jones said. 
“Palestinians deal with this 
sort of abuse every single day.”

Jones said Arm and other 

students 
verbally 
targeted 

SAFE because of a terrorist 
attack that occurred earlier 
that day in the West Bank, dur-
ing which three people were 
killed. Jones said the organi-
zation could not have foreseen 
before they planned the dem-
onstration.

“We reserved it a month in 

advance,” he said. “We were 
talking about specific Pales-
tinian suffering in result of 
state policy, and you wanted to 
point to the tragedy of that day. 
We’re being held to a double 
standard that should not exist 
for a student group.”

Arm responded to the alle-

gations 
by 
apologizing 
to 

SAFE, saying he acted emo-
tionally because a friend of 
his was killed in the terror-
ist attack — the dead included 
Ezra Schwartz, an American 
taking a gap year in Israel.

Arm said he does not believe 

in censorship, but does believe 
in his right to challenge the 
protesters on behalf of constit-
uents who may feel similarly to 
him.

“I felt I questioned the taste, 

timing, and appropriateness 
of this display. I specifically 
proposed that at the time, as 
opposed to an incendiary pro-
test portraying students as ter-
rorists,” Arm said. “I represent 
students who felt marginalized 
and unsafe by the protest. I 
don’t think I’ve done anything 
to jeopardize my position on 
this assembly.”

CSG representative Branden 

Shafer, an LSA senior, said he 
was concerned by Arm’s asser-
tion that he acted in accor-
dance with those he represents 
by asking SAFE to take the 
wall down.

patient safety.

“While recognizing you are can-

celling and moving surgeries to 
ensure no veterans are being put at 
risk, this situation is still concern-
ing and raises questions about the 
source of this particulate matter 
and what actions are being taken 
to correct the problem,” she wrote.

Dingell told the Daily she does 

believe the hospital both cares 
about its patients and is trying to 
handle the situation appropriately, 
but at the same time, it is her job to 
investigate the concerns of her con-
stituents.

She is currently awaiting a 

response to the questions she 
posed in her letter Monday.

“I have an obligation to make 

sure that the veterans are being 
taken care of and that the hospital 
has the resources they need,” she 
said.

Atkinson said patient safety is 

the hospital’s utmost priority, and 
it is currently operating on a lim-
ited surgery schedule while work-
ing to resolve the issue. He said 
any patient currently scheduled for 
surgery is being given the option to 
have their procedures done with 
any of the Healthcare System’s 
community partners, such as the 
University, though the stand-down 
period is over.

During the stand-down period, 

the Healthcare System invited 
national and regional experts to 
help identify what could be causing 
the particulate matter to appear 
on sterilized equipment. Atkinson 
said they concluded the particu-
late matter likely originated from a 

water main break in the area.

However, Dingell said Tuesday 

afternoon the hospital had not 
identified a specific cause of the 
problem when she last spoke with 
the director on Monday. In the let-
ter, she probes the hospital to deter-
mine the cause of the problem.

“As of (Monday) at 12:30, they 

didn’t know what was causing it,” 
she said. “We just need to find out 
the problem, we’ve got to make 
sure they’ve got the resources … 
and it’s our responsibility to raise 
awareness.”

If the complication was in fact 

caused by a water issue, Dingell 
discussed looking into whether 
there is a problem with the hos-
pital’s pipes. She also mentioned 
constituents were wondering if the 
presence of the particulates could 
be related to construction on site.

In the letter, Dingell also specifi-

cally asked what steps the hospital 
has taken to protect patient safety.

Atkinson said since Monday the 

system has replaced some pieces of 
equipment and installed more fil-
ters in the water system that serves 
the sterilizers.

He also stressed that no veter-

ans have been put in harm’s way: 
whenever a nurse would spot par-
ticulate matter near equipment, 
the Healthcare System would use a 
different set of equipment and send 
the potentially contaminated case 
back to be re-sterilized.

“I think we (have) made a lot of 

progress, but we’re still working to 
completely resolve the situation,” 
he said. “We see this as a proac-
tive measure, and we applaud our 
nurses — they do a diligent job of 
inspecting the cases to make sure 
they are prepped and ready to go 
for surgery.”

restrictions on smoking traditional 
cigarettes, would include labeling 
these cigarettes with warning signs 
of potential health hazards, and 
would also include some restric-
tions on the advertising and mar-
keting of e-cigarettes,” Davis said.

Results from the 2014 National 

Youth Tobacco Survey indicated 
that more than 4.6 million students 
under the age of 18 reported being 
current tobacco users, and of those, 
2.4 million reported using e-ciga-
rettes.

They survey also revealed that 

e-cigarette use is trending steep-
ly upward. From 2011 to 2014, 
e-cigarette use among high school 
students increased by nearly 800 
percent, and e-cigarette use among 
young adults has increased as well.

Data released in October of this 

year by the National Center for 
Health Statistics National Health 
Interview Survey indicated that 
nearly 22 percent of adults ages 18 
to 24 years old have tried an e-ciga-
rette at least once.

Davis said many states are 

considering additional e-ciga-
rette restrictions, though every 
U.S. state except Michigan and 
Pennsylvania already prohibits 
the sale of e-cigarretes to minors. 
Davis was specifically interested 
in what the level of public sup-
port would be for those addition-
al restrictions or — in the case of 
e-cigarettes — taxes.

Despite the Ann Arbor City 

Council’s April 2014 ordinance to 
restrict outdoor smoking — includ-
ing with e-cigarettes — in certain 
locations, a complete ban on e-cig-
arette use on campus has not yet 
followed suit.

According to the Tobacco Free 

College Campus Initiative, as of 
October, 769 college campuses 

across America prohibit the use 
of e-cigarettes anywhere on their 
campus. However, only the Uni-
versity of Michigan Health System 
and the School of Dentistry have 
banned the use of e-cigarettes so 
far. 

Though teens and parents noto-

riously disagree on many topics, 
Davis said when it comes to e-cig-
arettes, it seems that teens and 
parents agree about what should 
be done.

“I’m impressed by the high 

level of support for restrictions on 
e-cigarettes among these younger 
teens today, and even if that sup-
port decreased somewhat (when 
students go off to college), the level 
of support for restriction would still 
be quite high,” he said.

Along with support for restric-

tions, Davis’ research also found 
that upwards of 80 percent of teens 
and parents believe allowing the 
use of e-cigarettes could instigate 
use of other tobacco products. He 
also noted that, despite popular 
belief, using an e-cigarette is not 
necessarily less harmful than using 
other tobacco products.

Though potential long-term 

risks associated with e-cigarette 
use are unknown, exposure to 
nicotine at a young age can harm 
brain development, encourage 
addiction and lead to further use 
of tobacco products, according to 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.

“The manufacturers of e-ciga-

rettes say that their products are 
safer than traditional cigarettes 
because they have fewer different 
types of chemicals that traditional 
cigarettes have,” Davis said. “How-
ever, no long term testing on health 
is available for e-cigarettes because 
they are still a fairly new product 
and we don’t know what long term 
use may do in terms of any health 
problems.”

coming to the University, said 
she thinks the setup of the res-
taurant will appeal to college 
students.

“I love the setup of Piada 

because it is similar to Chipotle 
in the sense that people call it the 
‘Italian Chipotle’ when you stand 
in line and order, the ingredients 
are right in front of you and the 
team members walk you down 
the line and make the food fresh 
in front of you,” Ngo said. “I 
think people would enjoy Piada 
a lot because it’s like wraps, sal-
ads and pasta bowls to go and it 
is relatively cheaper than other 
casual 
fast-food 
restaurants. 

Piada is also one of those res-
taurants you can never have too 
much of, so I think it’ll fare well 
with the budget-conscious col-

lege students here in Ann Arbor.”

Several 
other 
fast-casual 

restaurants have also opened 
in Ann Arbor recently, such as 
Pieology and Salads Up on East 
Liberty Street.

For students interested in 

working at the new Piada, the 
company offers a tuition assis-
tance program for employees.

“For supervisors and above — 

there’s three levels that we have 
of supervision here at our res-
taurants — we offer $1,000 back 
per quarter with a maximum of 
$2,000 per year,” Eisenacher 
said.

Though the opening is months 

away, people can sign up as a 
pre-opening VIP member by fol-
lowing the restaurant on social 
media or signing up on their 
website. Piada will choose about 
1,500 people to eat for free the 
week before the opening.

vas Ann Arbor looking for cans 
and bottles that they can recycle 
for a 10-cent deposit. They call 
themselves “canners,” and prac-
tice “canning.” Each game day, 
the cycle takes place — thousands 
of cans are discarded by fans and 
canners pick them up, clean them 
off and collect their deposit. For 
a whole season’s worth of home 
games, I followed canners around 
Ann Arbor. All have their own 
reason for canning, their own suc-
cesses and strategies, their own 
struggles with the system, their 
own story. 

I met 73-year-old Jerry Quig-

ley, an Ann Arbor resident, out-
side the Big House during the 
Michigan State game on Oct. 17. 
As clouds loomed overhead, he 
dragged a folding shopping cart 
behind him as he picked through 
the recycling bins, sometimes 
waiting for a fan to chuck a can 
into the bin before removing it. 
Short and lumbering, his wide 
smile shone through a dense gray 
beard and black stumps where 
several teeth had once been. He 
wore a crushed baseball cap bear-
ing the name of the ship he fought 
on during the Vietnam War and 
yellow-tinted sunglasses. Born 
and raised in Chelsea, Mich., after 
the war he returned to Ann Arbor 
and hasn’t left.

Quigley now just cans for the 

exercise and to help pay the rent 
for his small apartment — he 
makes the rest of the payment by 
doing odd-jobs for his landlord. 
I strolled along with him as he 
made his rounds of the bright blue 
bins. Fans occasionally glanced 
at him, but no one intervened. I 
asked a poncho-clad usher if he 
cared that Quigley was canning 
right in front of the entrance.

“Hey, it’s a public space, you 

know,” he replied with a shrug.

Michigan has an unusually 

generous deposit system. Since 
the Michigan Beverage Container 
Act was enacted in 1978, Michi-
gan has charged a 10-cent deposit 
on carbonated beverage contain-
ers, compared to the usual 5-cent 
deposit in the 10 other states with 
bottle bills. The containers can 
then be exchanged for the deposit 
at many grocery and liquor stores. 
The only catch is that the contain-
ers must be purchased in state.

“I’ve had times when I col-

lected a bunch of cans from Ohio 
State fans and then had them 
rejected when I tried to return 
them,” Quigley said. 

Some people do “can” simply 

as a hobby. I met Ann Arbor resi-
dents Tim, Brian and Pat as they 
were scavenging the sidewalks 
of East University Avenue during 
the Northwestern game Oct. 10, 
all of them 40-something men, 
scruffy, dressed in dirty T-shirts, 
jeans, sturdy work boots and can-
vas gloves. All three declined to 
give their last names.

“We’re just in it for some ciga-

rette and sandwich money,” Pat 
said.

“It’s just about good company 

and some extra money in the 
pocket,” Tim added.

I was not expecting this. I had 

assumed that all canners must 
be homeless or desperate. But 

these guys are just friends out 
for a jaunt. They all have day jobs 
doing construction and carpentry. 
They’re all from the city — Tim’s 
house is actually just about a mile 
down Packard Street. They clear-
ly regard themselves as a different 
breed of canner

“None of us drink,” Pat said. 
While there are some small 

timers, for sure, many canners are 
also, by necessity, after larger pay-
checks. I met Ann Arbor resident 
Anthony Taylor after he drove 
past me in a beat-up sedan during 
the Northwestern game. Strapped 
to every square inch of the car’s 
exterior were bulging bags of 
cans. The trunk was propped 
open to accommodate more bags.

Thin, with a close-cropped 

beard, Taylor is decked out in 
Michigan gear: blue sweatpants, 
Wolverine zip up, block ‘M’ hat. 
He is 46 years old. He has a regular 
job at a chain restaurant in town, 
but regularly cans for money to 
support his seven children. His 
strategy is to raid various frater-
nity pregames after everyone has 
left and haul away hundreds of 
cans and bottles. In the hierarchy 
of “canners,” he considers himself 
a notch above guys like Tim and 
Pat, who can only carry a light 
load.

“I’ll let guys on foot clean up 

the cans — aluminum is lighter 
than glass, you know?” he said 
with a slight smirk. “I’m in it to 
win it.”

I walked with him into back-

yard of the house, through a giant 
blue tarp acting as a curtain. It’s a 
swamp — the ground has turned 
to mud from so much spilled alco-
hol and crushed cans float on it 
like lilypads. Taylor was trying 
to break his record of $245. He 
always starts by gathering any 
intact cans and bottles that he can 
find, ones that the foot soldiers 
haven’t scavenged yet.

He digs through the trash bins 

the fraternity had set out, picking 
out half-full cans and pouring out 
the contents before stuffing them 
in his bag. These will get depos-
ited at Lucky’s Market on South 
Industrial Highway, where he can 
deposit $25 worth of containers 
per day, per the store’s policy. He 
claimed that he’ll get hassled if he 
hauls this much into Meijer.

I asked him whether this is, 

technically, stealing.

“Students aren’t going to go get 

the deposit — they’re too busy,” he 
replied. He notes that he leaves 
behind any unopened beers he 
finds.

As a canner with a vehicle, 

Taylor can not only deposit more 
intact cans, but also make money 
off scrap aluminum. Crushed cans 
are not redeemable for deposit. 
However, many local junk yards 
will pay for scrap aluminum by 
the pound. Anthony picks out 
the good cans from the bins, and 
then takes the whole garbage bag, 
which now contains mangled 
cans and bits of trash that he’ll 
have to pick out later.

Sometimes, he said, he gets 

hassled by residents for pick-
ing through their garbage, even 
though sidewalk bins are techni-
cally in the public domain.

“Everyone has their own crim-

inals,” he said.

I help him drag a few grimy 

bags out to his car and ask if he’s 

OK with me including him in the 
story. He replies that he’s fine 
with it as long as it won’t prevent 
him from canning.

“This is a good hustle,” he said. 

“A legitimate hustle.”

That same day, I met one of the 

on-foot canners. Brian, 50 years 
old, has been canning on and off 
for four years. He asked that his 
last name not be used.

For most of his adult life, he 

worked a string of odd jobs. He 
has been plagued with health 
problems for much of that time: 
peripheral artery disease, diabe-
tes, glaucoma and, most recently, 
right forearm and left shoulder 
injuries from a slip on an icy side-
walk in Ann Arbor. 

“I don’t want to have to collect 

disability, but there’s a limit to 
what I can do,” he tells me.

The problem, Brian said, is that 

he’s been rejected for disability 
support multiple times. He’s too 
ill to work a normal job, so he has 
to make do with canning.

“This is my sole source of 

income,” he said.

He lives in subsidized housing 

on North Main Street and cans 
most days and every football game 
day. He needs $300 per month to 
pay for rent and food. He has no 
car, so he needs to make regular 
bus trips to Meijer and Kroger 
every evening to drop off his cans.

Through the getDowntown 

Program, the Ann Arbor Transit 
Authority offers something called 
a “go!pass,” which employers in 
downtown Ann Arbor can buy 
in bulk and distribute to their 
employees. According to the get-
Downtown website, the pass 
gives holders unlimited access to 
fixed bus routes and discounts on 
other commuting services, as well 
as many downtown stores. 

But Brian, being unemployed, 

isn’t eligible for a go!pass, which 
he said frustrates him. Later on, 
I would explain his situation to 
getDowntown program director 
Nancy Shore. She said though he 
couldn’t get a go!pass, he might 
be eligible for “Fare Deal,” which 
cuts the normal $1.50 bus fare in 
half for low-income individuals.

Until then, he must pay $3 

every day for a pass — an equiva-
lent to 30 cans Brian has to find 
and lug around before he can 
make any money that day.

He spotted a can in my garbage, 

lifted it out, and looked disap-
pointed.

“All these Arizona Iced Tea 

cans lying around — it drives me 
crazy,” he says.

In Michigan, only carbonated 

beverage containers — beer cans, 
soda bottles, etc. — have a deposit 
on it. Every day, Brian finds hun-
dreds of wine bottles, iced tea 
cans and milk cartons, but can’t 
use them.

Brian said he was anxiously 

following a bill introduced in the 
Michigan Legislature in March 
by state Sen. Rebekah Warren 
(D–Ann Arbor), currently await-
ing hearing in the Senate Natural 
Resources Committee. The bill, 
Senate Bill 199, would amend the 
original bottle bill to include non-
carbonated beverage containers 
eligible for deposit as well.

In a interview, Warren said 

the bill has received consider-
able support from environmental 
groups, but also some opposition 

from smaller retailers who lack 
the resources to handle and clean 
more containers.

“Our bottle bill is almost 40 

years old now, so we’re just trying 
to modernize,” Warren said. “The 
original bill only included car-
bonated beverages because that’s 
what people were drinking back 
then. Now, people drink lots of 
bottled water and energy drinks, 
and I wanted to find a way to get 
those recycled.”

Warren said she did not intro-

duce the bill with canners in mind. 
However, she added that she was 
happy to learn that it could have a 
positive effect on them.

“If there are folks out there 

who can supplement or make 
an income by returning more of 
these containers and getting them 
out of landfills, that’s wonderful,” 
she said.

But there are also some can-

ners, unlike Brian, who just need 
to make some quick money. I met 
Ann Arbor residents Amanda 
James and Felicia Hamilton dur-
ing the Michigan State game Oct. 
17. They had a shopping cart filled 
with cans, and were weaving in 
and out of pregamers like run-
ning backs, picking up any can 
that someone dropped. Occasion-
ally, the students would just hand 
the cans, freshly drained, to the 
women. Electro-soul blasted from 
the speakers, and Felicia occa-
sionally stopped canning to dance 
along to the music. They asked me 
if they could bum a cigarette, and 
we got to talking. Both women 
grew up in the city.

“Born and raised!” James 

shouted.

They paused to gently heckle 

a few MSU fans who passed by, 
and then explained their motives. 
Neither of them is a habitual can-
ner, but they said they needed 
money to help Hamilton rent a 
U-Haul and pay a $1,350 secu-
rity deposit. She has to move to a 
cheaper house in Ann Arbor, she 
said, because she was expecting to 
receive a Section 8 voucher from 
the city that fell through.

“Housing access, and you can 

print this, is full of shit,” Hamil-
ton said.

I spoke with Weneshia Brand, a 

manager at the Ann Arbor Hous-
ing Commission, about that issue. 
She said the city issues Section 8 
vouchers to help low-income resi-
dents pay rent with money comes 
from the federal government.

Funding is scarce right now, 

and the voucher waitlist is about 
five years. Until then, James and 
Hamilton said, they have to make 
ends meet in whatever way they 
can.

“And this is free money,” James 

added of canning. “The best free 
money.” 

Most of the canners I met 

had a scrappy pride in what they 
were doing, even if it often seems 
tedious and grimy. But their work 
is simultaneously a symptom of 
economic and political shortcom-
ings and a cure for the massive 
amount of waste Ann Arbor pro-
duces on football game days. It is 
“free money” for those without 
more conventional means. But 
given the amount of recycling and 
cleaning that gets done by can-
ners, we should at least ask our-
selves: Who is it really “free” for?

for your fellow students, many of 
you are part of student organiza-
tions that support amazing causes 
here at U-M and beyond.”

Last year, the University sur-

passed its goal of raising $1 mil-
lion from at least 1,000 donors 
— amassing about $3.2 million 
from 5,437 donors, half of whom 
were new. Judy Malcolm, senior 
director of executive communi-
cations in the Office of University 
Development, said the goal this 
year is to surpass that amount.

“We went way beyond it in 

terms of dollars and donors,” she 
said. “Introducing new donors 
was really fabulous … many of 

them students, and that was really 
fantastic.”

The outstanding support from 

donors, Malcolm said, means that 
they understand the spirit of phi-
lanthropy.

“We are often surprised by how 

many people don’t realize that the 
University is a public institution,” 
she said. “It is nonprofit. Often, 
the students ask why the Univer-
sity would raise money and we 
really take our great success to 
mean that people understand the 
power of philanthropy and sup-
port the University and what it’s 
doing.”

To increase donations this 

year,Malcolm said the University 
is working closely with student 
groups to help them with fun-
draising tactics and spreading 

awareness about the event. The 
University is currently collabo-
rating with 108 student organiza-
tions for Giving Blueday.

“One thing we found in the 

past we’re delighted with is that 
students get a better idea of phi-
lanthropy,” Malcolm said. “We 
think it’s important that they 
understand that fundraising isn’t 
just throwing money mindlessly 
in a bucket. They learn by being 
donors on Giving Blueday or by 
fundraising. They learn that they 
can accomplish things, make an 
impact by fundraising or by being 
a donor with a gift of any size.”

Last year, students donors 

raised $157,000 out of the $3.2 mil-
lion total. In her e-mail, Harper 
encouraged even greater student 
participation this year, noting 

that each student donation will be 
matched through a $40,000 dona-
tion made by alumni and parents.

Any area of the University, such 

as the health system, or programs 
like Semester in Detroit, are eli-
gable to recieve donations. 

Organizers are also encourag-

ing students to promote the fund-
raiser and thank donors for their 
contributions via social media.

Leading up to the event, the 

University and student organiza-
tions have sent out regular e-mail 
blasts to notify potential donors 
about Giving Blueday, as well as 
used social media challenges to 
encourage student participation.

“We’ve really put the word out 

all over campus,” Malcolm said. 
“All the colleges at the University 
are participating.”

I am the granddaughter of 

refugees.

My grandmother, Mara Ilona 

Grinbergs, was born in 1938 in 
Riga, Latvia, on the eve of World 
War II. Within a year, under 
the terms of a secret pact signed 
with Nazi Germany, the Soviet 
Union would invade her country, 
beginning a period of almost 50 
years of oppressive occupation for 
the small Baltic state. In the years 
that followed, the Soviets and the 
Nazis imposed successive regimes 
of terror in the country, forcibly 
deporting tens of thousands of 
people 
and 
murdering 
nearly 

200,000 
in 
the 
gulags 
and 

concentration camps. Among these 
people were my grandmother’s 
family, friends and neighbors.

It’s estimated that by the end of 

World War II, almost one-third of 
Latvia’s original population had 
been killed, deported or had fled the 
country to avoid such a fate. Similarly, 
it’s estimated that 90 percent of 
Latvia’s original Jewish population 
had been systematically murdered 
in one of the worst instances of 
genocide in modern history.

My grandmother was among 

those lucky enough to escape. 
She ate grass to avoid starvation, 
walked barefoot in the winter 
because she had no shoes and 
survived bombings that leveled the 
cities in which she sought refuge. 
After the war, and for the rest of her 
childhood, my grandmother lived 
in a refugee camp in Germany. She 
came to the United States only after 
immigration laws were enacted that 
recognized refugees and set quotas 
for their entry into the country.

Today, nearly 80 years later 

and despite a completely different 
political context, it’s difficult not to 
draw parallels between the ongoing 
humanitarian 
crisis 
affecting 

Syrian refugees and the situation 
my grandmother and so many 
others faced at the beginning of 
World War II.

Both politicians and society 

at large in the United States (and 
many other countries) have a long 
history of deciding who the “other” 
is in our nation. Who is defined as 
“other” is constantly changing, but 
the designation is often rooted in 
fear, discrimination and a lack of 
understanding; one that has always 
been arbitrary at best, given that 
the vast majority of Americans 
descended from immigrants at 
some point in their family lineage. 
At various times in U.S. history, the 
definition of “other” has included 
people from Irish, Mexican, Japa-
nese, African, Italian, Arab and a 
multitude of other backgrounds 
who have been subject to discrimi-
nation, forced internment, deporta-
tion, xenophobia and rejection from 
the communities in which they 
lived and worked.

In 1939, the “other” included 

German and Eastern European 
refugees; at the beginning of World 
War II, the majority of Americans 
surveyed in Gallup polls opposed 
allowing 
German 
and 
Jewish 

refugees, including children, into the 
country. Today — as evidenced by 
recent statements made by a number 
of U.S. and international politicians 
(including 31 state governors) that 
their countries and states will 
not accept Syrian refugees — this 
definition of the “other” includes 3 
million Syrians fleeing their homes 
to escape the terror and violence 
 

of ISIS.

From a political perspective 

(at least in the United States), 
these state-by-state declarations 
barring Syrian refugees are legally 
unenforceable, as the final say 
on immigration matters falls to 

the federal government. From a 
humanitarian perspective, we still 
have much to do to if, in the future, 
we hope to say we were not implicit 
in a human rights crisis of such 
massive and horrific proportions.

If you ever have wondered what 

you would have done to help during 
the humanitarian crisis of World 
War II, or of any other atrocity, the 
time to find out is now. Good places 
to start are:

1. Learn about the ongoing 

situation in Syria and about who 
the refugees are. Spread facts, not 
fear, and foster support.

2. Contact your elected officials 

and 
demand 
that 
your 
home 

state and city publically support 
accepting Syrian refugees. 

3. 
Through 
your 
state’s 

Department of Social Services, find 
out the name of your local contracted 
refugee service provider and donate 
and volunteer. For the Detroit area, 
this provider is the U.S. Committee 
for Refugees and Immigrants.

4. Support one of the well-

established 
aid 
organizations 

currently assisting Syrian refugees 
as we enter winter months. These 
include: United Nations Human 
Rights Council, Unicef, Medecins 
Sans 
Frontiers, 
International 

Rescue 
Committee 
and 
Save 
 

the Children.

Last year, in a lecture given at 

Hill Auditorium, the acclaimed 
author and activist Alice Walker 
made a plea to thousands of 
students, faculty and community 
members hailing from around the 
world that rings true to me today 
more than ever: “Hope never to say 
yes to another person’s suffering. 
Hope never to make the mistake 
that they are not you.”

A

t least five of my friends shared or 
posted about it. Apparently, when asked 
about terrorists, Russian president 

Vladimir Putin said, “To 
forgive the terrorists is up 
to God, but to send them to 
him is up to me.”

Given 
what 
I 
know 

about 
Putin 
(which 
is 

limited 
to 
the 
popular 

image of him riding a horse 
shirtless, various hunting 
expeditions and general 
male bravado), it seemed 
plausible, so I shrugged 
and moved on. Here’s the 
problem, and this is not a 
joke: Putin never said that, and the line is from 
a Denzel Washington film from 2004.

Originally tweeted by Russia Today news 

anchor Remi Maalouf, this false quote was 
shared millions of times by Americans, loving its 
boldness and action-hero feel. With comments 
like “This guy is the man” and “Oh no he didn’t!” 
a handful of my Facebook friends reveled in the 
news. Similar posts (and from similar friends) 
have claimed that the same “crisis actor” can 
be shown in photos in the wake of the Paris 
attacks, shootings at Aurora and Newtown, 
pumping out fodder for conspiracy theorists 
(several sources have confirmed that these are 
three 
different 
people). 

Take your pick of posts 
that make you the least bit 
suspicious, run a Google 
search and, more often 
than not, it will turn out to 
be ridiculous or nonsense.

What stands out isn’t the 

fact that misinformation 
runs rampant in the world 
of social media — this is, 
unfortunately, 
a 
given. 

What stands out is, as 
Charles Spurgeon said, “A lie can travel halfway 
round the world while the truth is putting on its 
shoes.” (Not Mark Twain, I looked it up.)

Corrections and fact checks will never 

spread like wildfire.

So why does this scare me? Facebook has 

already become the social media platform 
most prone to isolating one’s point of 
view, with volatile comment sections and 
questionable sources. In one study about 
political polarization, social scientists found 
that “roughly speaking a Facebook user has 
five politically like-minded friends for every 
one friend on the other side of the spectrum.”

People become more daring behind a 

keyboard. Facebook users are more liable to 
scroll past posts with which they disagree with 
or unfriend the person altogether. Twitter and 
Instagram seem to escape this seriousness, 
likely due to the youthfulness of its audience 
(less chance for serious argument among 
teenagers sharing vines than adults sharing 
politicized statuses). Combine all of this 
potential for hostility with misinformation and 
a general disregard for fact-checking; now, add 
in the fact that 2016 is an election year. That’s 

why Facebook is starting to scare me.

Having said this, social media remains an 

incredible outlet for political engagement. 
The introduction of candidates to younger 
audiences, with greater activity through apps 
like Snapchat and Instagram, will do wonders 
for millennial voter turnout. Candidates may 
live-tweet debates, but where’s the account 
live fact-checking, and why isn’t it the most 
important? Social media cannot be a haven 
for inaccuracies and false statements on issues 
of importance — a Vladimir Putin quote is 
relatively harmless in the grand scheme of 
things, but imagine the havoc a well-placed 
Hillary Clinton misquote could wreak.

This past January, Facebook announced it 

would label suspected hoaxes and fake news 
with a warning and reduce the frequency of 
posts with misinformation in the news feed. 
If this is happening on a regular basis, either 
my settings are messed up or the plan of attack 
isn’t working. The questionable material I see 
posted every day is as prevalent as ever. And 
simply put, change on this front cannot come 
from the organization itself — it has to come 
from responsible Facebook users who question 
sources, who share corrections and who refuse 
to allow friends with whom they disagree to 
disappear into a bubble of falsities and dema-
goguery. I’ve seen it happen and it’s not pretty.

One reason this strikes me now more 

than ever is the ongoing 
discussion 
about 

coddling that I have seen 
shared on my timeline 
by Facebook friends of 
other generations. The 
Washington Post asked, 
“Are 
colleges 
coddling 

students or just leveling 
the playing field?” and 
the Atlantic bemoaned, 
“The Coddling of the 
 

American Mind.”

In a recent Wall Street Journal editorial 

titled “The Rise of the College Crybullies” by 
Roger Kimball, my generation is accused of 
hiding behind trigger warnings, and is said to 
be overly sensitive and politically correct. As 
a student at a large, liberal, public university, 
let me say that instances of racism and sexism, 
even in its subtlest forms that I may not 
understand, take a toll on my peers. Students 
and their ability to learn are affected. 
I’m proud to be a part of the generation 
ensuring that during these formative years of 
education, people have a safe space to live and 
learn. This isn’t coddling, it’s just decent. 

Every 
generation, 
political 
base 
and 

ideological faction walls themselves in, on 
Facebook and otherwise, from people with 
whom they disagree. Millennials, instead of 
walling ourselves in with false sources and 
Facebook posts — the kind that paint the world 
in black and white, beget conspiracy theories 
and refuse to be corrected — have chosen 
inclusive language and tolerance.

Facebook is starting to scare me

The rent is in fact too damn high
F

irst off, happy Thanksgiving!

In my last column, I 

discussed growing economic 

disparity 
right 
here 
in 

Ann 
Arbor. 

I 
mentioned 

that we’re the 
eighth 
most 

economically 
segregated 
city 

in the nation. I 
mentioned that 
the 
incomes 

of the top 10 
percent of our 
residents 
are 

growing, and growing fast, while 
the exact opposite is true of our 
bottom 10 percent. And I mentioned 
that a couple working two full-time 
jobs at minimum wage can’t afford 
to live here, nor can a public school 
teacher. What I didn’t mention was 
a solution.

So what can we do?
Well most immediately, we can 

try to lower our housing costs. For 
all the ways Ann Arbor is unique, 
there’s one specific way that’s 
very relevant to this particular 
conversation. And that is that we’re 
a hot real estate market. So hot, in 
fact, that back in July, Ann Arbor 
was ranked the ninth hottest market 
in the United States — a ranking 
that matches us with some of the 
largest cities in the country. To put 
that ranking in perspective, in Ann 
Arbor, the average house will only 
spend 61 days on the market before 
sale. In Manhattan, that number is 
73 days. We’re moving faster than 
a real estate market that doesn’t 
sleep. And that means Big Apple 
prices in a small Midwestern city.

Now, as students, we probably 

have a good five to 10 years before 
we start to use the word “buy.” For 
now, most of us are renters. But we 
exist in that same world — demand 
for housing is demand for housing. 
A Harvard study shows that, after 
the last recession, homeownership 
is steadily falling while rental 
demand is surging nationally. In 
Ann Arbor, homes are being bought 
up at higher prices and middle-class 

residents are being pushed into the 
rental market. That means students 
and professionals are competing 
for the same type of apartments. 
That also means the average one-
bedroom unit will cost $1,244 per 
month, almost double the monthly 
rate of East Lansing.

It’s clear people want to live 

here. But are we really giving them 
or ourselves a chance?

The short answer is no, or not 

yet. This huge demand for housing 
doesn’t have the supply to match it. 
Common sense, Economics 101 and 
that same Harvard study all say that 
if supply increases to match demand, 
price will lower. Here in Ann Arbor, 
we can’t legally grow our city limits 
outward. We’re 
about 29 square 
miles, and that 
number 
won’t 

ever 
change 

much. 
That 

means we need 
to 
invest 
in 

denser housing — 
townhouses over 
McMansions and 
some high-rises 
downtown. That said, I believe all 
things should be done in moderation 
— saturation is good, oversaturation 
is bad. After all, it was a real estate 
bubble that caused our last financial 
crisis. But at the end of the day, we 
work in a market and so we have to 
work with the market.

Now, the laws of supply and 

demand have been around for more 
than 300 years. But Ann Arbor is 
a hub of technological and social 
innovation. Our response to a 
crisis in affordability should be 
innovative, too.

So a question: What do a young 

tech entrepreneur, public school 
teacher, artist and retiree all have 
in common?

The answer is they all have pretty 

similar incomes. Right now, Ann 
Arbor’s housing market works great 
for the wealthy. And the Ann Arbor 
Housing Commission provides pub-
lic housing for our neighbors most in 
need. But there’s a missing middle to 
the housing market — a middle that 

would satisfy the needs of young tech 
entrepreneurs, public school teach-
ers, artists and retirees alike.

Luckily, we have some options. 

The most straightforward is to sell 
or lease public land — parking lots or 
old facilities — to private developers 
at below market rate. This lowers 
the cost of construction to such a 
degree that the new landlords can, 
in turn, rent the new units at below 
market rate. Potential partners 
are already itching to get going. 
These public-private partnerships 
spread 
responsibility 
for 
the 

community 
across 
government 

and business while hedging both 
 

sides’ investments.

Want to spread the responsi-

bility 
further? 

We can put the 
power right in 
the 
hands 
of 

the 
residents 

themselves. 
Neighborhood 
cooperatives 
have the power 
to regulate sale 
price, 
ensur-

ing prices only 

increase at a set rate. In fact, we 
already have thriving townhouse 
cooperatives here in Ann Arbor.

These issues are by no means 

isolated to Ann Arbor. These 
are issues facing every cool and 
desirable city across the United 
States. But the solutions will 
never come naturally. They will 
come as a result of dedication and 
commitment. And they will succeed 
as a result of thoughtful design.

It’s an uphill battle and it will 

take time. But it’s the change we 
need. Because you should graduate 
and feel like you can afford to stay 
here. You should live a full life and 
feel like you can afford to retire 
here. And for all those years in 
between, you and all your neighbors 
should live comfortably, free from 
the undue burden of high rents 
and high mortgages created by an 
overburdened housing market.

“Look, it’s some sex and gore over there!”
Sex, gore, charm 
 

in ‘Final Girls’ 

Offbeat horror film 

takes a satirical 
look at the genre

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

Somewhere between “Scream” 

and “Wet Hot American Summer,” 
we find “Final Girls,” an offbeat 
movie 
about 

horror movies. 
Taissa Farmiga 
(“The 
Bling 

Ring”) 
plays 

Max, 
a 
high 

school student 
floundering 
after the death 
of her mom, a 
B-list 
scream 

queen played by 
Malin 
Acker-

man 
(“Watch-

men”). 
She’s 

coerced into a screening of her 
mom’s most famous movie, “Camp 
Bloodbath,” when a freak accident 
theater fire (because those hap-
pen apparently) causes Max and 
her friends to escape through the 
screen and into the world of the 
movie, a campy teen slasher with a 
Michael Myers-type villain. 

It doesn’t take long for the resi-

dent horror movie nerd to make 

himself known and dish out some 
serious survival strategies. Per 
usual, a girl’s protective armor 
is her virginity. Interestingly 
enough, there doesn’t seem to be 
a good way to survive if you’re a 
boy. Adam Devine’s (“Pitch Per-
fect”) anachronistic jock charac-
ter is killed unceremoniously and 
the movie nerd himself (Thomas 
Middleditch “Silicon Valley”) is 
killed twice. Unlike “Scream,” 
“Final Girls” follows the rules 
it’s critiquing. Max decides to 
keep Nancy (her mom’s charac-
ter) alive by keeping her chaste. If 
Max and her friends can survive 
by making it to the final credits 
(granted it is unclear how they 
came to that realization), so can 
Nancy, right? But this attempt is 
made futile by the fact that Nancy 
is also “the shy girl with the clip-
board and the guitar,” a new rule 
seemingly created only to vali-
date the deaths of virgin charac-
ters. Not only do you have to be a 
virgin to survive “Camp Blood-
bath,” but you also have to be the 
“right” kind of virgin.

“Camp Bloodbath” looks like 

someone put an Instagram filter 
on a low-budget remake of “Hal-
loween.” Everything is cast in a 
golden light that screams nostal-
gia, and the final fight scene is a 
grand machete battle set against 
purple fog and pink lightning. It’s 

as visually striking as it is over-
the-top. The exaggerated palate 
sets the world of “Camp Blood-
bath” outside the bounds of reali-
ty, and it therefore allows the plot 
to bend in unrealistic ways.

The title “Final Girls” is a lit-

tle misleading — Max is the only 
girl who actually gets to survive 
until the end. And while all of 
the real-world girls come back to 
life in time for the sequel, Max is 
the only one privileged with the 
final battle, a fact that is disap-
pointing for anyone expecting a 
badass five-on-one takedown of 
the creepy masked killer.

Amid all the sex and gore, 

“Final Girls” manages to find 
some poignancy in the relation-
ship between Max and Nancy. 
Following a gory run in with Billy, 
the masked killer, Max and Nancy 
share a moment where Nancy is 
allowed to voice the fears of her 
off-screen counterpart — not 
being a part of her daughter’s life. 
The scene is clunky and a little 
confusing (no one in their right 
mind empties their heart out 
next to a half-dead maniac with 
a machete), but it establishes the 
film as something more than just 
a 21st century “Scream.”

Despite some plotholes and 

inconsistencies, “Final Girls” is a 
charming, poignant satire of teen 
slasher movies.

ALBUM REVIEW

Arca’s ‘Mutant’ far 
from an easy listen 

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

The 
Venezuelan 
producer 

Alejandro Ghersi, known as 
“Arca,” works on the edge of 
reality. 
When 

he teamed up 
with the celes-
tial artist Björk 
to produce her 
album Vulnicu-
ra, he described 
it as a natural 
fit. 
Musically, 

this 
makes 

sense: both artists create coded 
and complex music, and the emo-
tions attached are difficult to 
identify. Longing is the general 
theme of Vulnicura, but Björk’s 
longing is far more alien and 
nuanced than the emotion we 
typically describe it as. Delicately 
balancing cosmic production and 
affecting string arrangements, 
she walks the line between our 
world and the beyond. A new 
version of the album, Vulnicura 
Strings, strips away everything 
but the strings and the vocals — a 
humanizing move for the enig-
matic artist.

Arca’s new album Mutant is 

the sonic antithesis to Vulnicura 
Strings. Gentle orchestras are 
replaced with huge industrial 
sounds. Where Björk sings, Arca 
roars. It’s an angry departure 
from Earth. 

But while Vulnicura Strings 

and Mutant are musical oppo-
sites, they feel similar. Both grow 
and contract like living, breath-
ing creatures. This kind of con-
tradiction is what Arca thrives 
on. The most vulnerable track 
on the album, “Gratitud,” uses 
a harsh metallic tone to create 
warmth. “F*ggot” is both delicate 
and severe, mixing dance music 
synths and industrial tones with 
peaceful bells and choir. It’s an 
attempt to take ownership of the 
derogatory term and attach a pos-
itive connotation to it, much like 
hip hop has done with “n*gga.”

Much of Mutant deals with 

(while never actually vocalizing) 
this struggle over sexuality. Arca 
said that he had a difficult time 
accepting he was gay, a truth 
brewing quietly inside until 
reaching a cathartic roar. Open-

ing track “Alive” marches with 
this confident defiance, look-
ing his demons in the face and 
embracing them. The cathartic 
roar takes form in “En,” a song 
that grows and churns to climax 
in a beastly growl. This is the 
frightening cry of a man who has 
been restrained and outcast for 
too long — a mutant, you could 
say. Even during his most viscer-
al moments, though, Arca never 
leaves the dark, alien world that 
Mutant inhabits.

Interestingly, 
Arca 
called 

Mutant a very “social” album. 
Many of the songs are apparently 
evocative of a friend or moment in 
his life. While only Arca can know 
the personal stories behind these 
tracks, one thing is clear: Arca has 
some eccentric friends. Beyond 
his Björk collaboration, he added 
production to Kanye’s Yeezus, a 
number of FKA Twigs’ releases 
and Kelela’s Hallucinogen, all 
of which are on the forefront of 
futuristic music. Traces of these 
artists are everywhere in Mutant. 
The terrifying screams from the 
title track are reminiscent of 
Kanye’s on “I Am a God.” FKA 
Twig’s 
consuming 
sensuality 

seeps through tracks like “Front 
Load” and “Extent.” “Snakes” is 
a reference to the zodiac symbol 
Arca and Björk share. 

Compared to his previous 

releases, Mutant is the most 
sweeping. The minimalism of 
his debut album Xen felt like a 

trip through outer space; Mutant 
feels like an arrival to a far away 
planet. Visually, it invokes a 
futuristic dystopian city (think 
“Terminator” or “Blade Run-
ner”). Arca has been moving in 
this direction since the begin-
ning of his career. His earlier, 
more 
approachable 
mixtapes 

Stretch 1 and Stretch 2 were 
strongly influenced by hip hop. 
Stretch 2’s “Brokeup” included 
vocally altered rap verses that 
resembled 
rapper/producer 

Madlib’s alter-ego Quasimoto. 
This kind of genre association 
and vocal presence disappeared 
as Arca progressed, as did any 
comfort his music once had. By 
the time Xen was released, Arca 
had become a genre to himself, 
and Mutant expands further into 
unexplored musical territory. 

Standout tracks like “Vanity” 

and “Soichiro” plunge you into 
that dark dystopian world like a 
bad trip. “Vanity” is particular-
ly mesmerizing, swelling with 
symbols and high pitched tones 
that alternate between float-
ing idly and racing like a roller 
coaster. That said, Mutant is far 
from an easy listen. It demands 
stamina and weighs heavily on 
the listener. It’s also one of the 
best electronic albums of the 
year, a major accomplishment 
in a time of plenty of high-qual-
ity releases. Arca has proven 
himself to be a powerful voice 
in the future of music.

STYLE NOTEBOOK
2015 AMAs: Best 
and worst dressed

By Daily Style Writers

The 2015 American Music 

Awards, hosted by J-Lo herself, 
was filled with just the right 
amount of rain (#Belieber), wins 
(TSwift needs to give it a rest), 
shade (Nicki Minaj) and Jared 
Leto we could all hope for. Here’s 
the Daily Style Squad’s rundown 
of who dominated the fashion 
department at the event, as well 
as the celebrities that should have 
traded their “outfits” for garbage 
bags (Harry Styles would have 
been better off).

BEST- TYGA 

Never have I ever regarded 

Tyga as a fashion ideal. Yet, in 
the wake of last night’s sarto-
rial tragedies, Tyga restored my 
dwindling faith in Hollywood’s 
fashion elite. Needless to say, I 
was wholly disappointed with 
the women’s fashion. I’m unsure 
why stars — who have nearly 
every designer and gown at their 
fingertips — are shying away 
from elegant silhouettes and 
opting for borderline Forever 
21-esque frocks and separates. 
But alas, young Nguyen-Ste-
venson stood out from his male 
counterparts in a sharp navy suit 
and kept it casual sans tie. As for 
happy endings — just as a fashion 
fairytale would have it — he and 
Kylie were spotted canoodling at 
Bieber’s after party. Shouts out to 
Tyga for winning bae back with 
sleekness and sophistication. — 
Caroline Filips

BEST- NINA DOBREV

My best dressed from the 2015 

AMA’s undoubtedly goes to Nina 
Dobrev. Dobrev looked absolutely 
stunning in a white gown and 
jacket by Zuhair Murad. The look 
was completed with bright floral 
accents, embellishing the top of 
the gown along with the borders of 
the jacket. Dobrev took the award 
for classiest last night by a long 
shot, yet she still managed to be 
one of the sexiest looks on the car-
pet. Job well done goes out to Nina 
and her stylist, as she completely 
stole the show. — Julia Doyle

WORST- Z LA LA

Who’s Z La La? She’s the 

woman in the weird upside-
down octopus costume on the 
red carpet. Completed with an 
excessive head piece similar to a 
tulip, it would have been best that 
it never bloomed. Let’s leave the 
sea animals in the ocean and the 
Gaga-ing to the O.G. — Christian 
Kennedy

WORST- GWEN STEFANI 
Alas, Gwen, I used to love you, 

too. Remember the Harajuku era, 
when you were rocking the off-
beat schoolgirl vibes and we all 
pretended to like it? I can’t pretend 
anymore. Stefani threw me for a 
loop with profound poof of the bat-
wing-on-steroids variety. As for 
her bottom half, I’m usually pro 
pants-less style choices, but the 
exposed leotard was more tacky 
than tasteful. — Caroline Filips

BEST- DNCE

Joe Jonas and band rocked 

coordinated outfits with maroon 
and grey tones. Jinjoo Lee’s 
knee-high maroon boots and 
sunglasses 
along 
with 
Jack 

Lawless’s black leather pants 
complimented 
Cole 
Whittle’s 

felt shirt. Jonas’s blue hair and 
printed 
button-down 
added 

just the right amount of pop 
for the band’s first red carpet 
appearance. — Christian Kennedy

WORST- HARRY STYLES
Three words: attack of floral. 

Not sure what Harry Styles was 
thinking or trying to prove in his 
hideous, cheap imitation Hawai-
ian pantsuit. While, I will admit, 
this outfit may be awesome for 
escaping the paparazzi and cam-
ouflaging into a Hawaiian land-
scape, for the purposes of every 
other event in life, it’s a tragic 
waste of time, fabric and celeb-
rity influence. Harry, oh Harry, 
has Zayn’s departure affected 
you so much that you’ll show 
up at AMAs dressed like you’re 
having an existential midlife cri-
sis at the tender age of 21? But I 
digress; let’s take a step back 
from the clearly tragic pattern 
and move on to the hem — that 
is, the flared pants. WHY? Why 
are you doing this to yourself and 
millions of pre-teen girls who 
are still obsessed with you? For 
the sake of the world, throw this 
repurposed Ikea bedspread out 
and move on. — Mariam Sheikh

BEST- DEMI LOVATO

Demi Lovato looked effort-

lessly chic at the AMA entrance 
last night. Her ’20s-inspired wavy 
dark brown hair was immacu-
lately done, and it complemented 
her sequin-printed long gown. 
The dress was completely backless 
with a slit that came up nearly to 

her hip (can you say bold?). Lova-
to’s makeup was daring with a 
black smoky eye and burgundy lip-
stick. She completed her old Hol-
lywood glam look with a jeweled 
clutch and black rings. Overall, she 
would have even given Poot a run 
for her money. — Carly Colonnese

BEST- NICK JONAS

Whoever 
categorized 
the 

“groufit” as something grotesque 
and lame is surely eating their 
words right now, since ex-Jo-bro 
and former high-profile Disney 
star proved them ever so wrong 
last night. Donned in, you guessed 
it, a grey suit with an aggressively 
grey turtleneck, not only did Jonas 
redefine an Urban Dictionary defi-
nition, but he channeled “Hotline 
Bling” Drake in the best possible 
way. While he may be a dead Red 
Devil killer (#SpoilerAlert), he 
and his style will forever be in our 
hearts, minds and camera rolls. — 
Mariam Sheikh

WORST- JENNY 
MCCARTHY

Everything 
about 
Jenny 

McCarthy’s outfit was too much. 
From the lipstick-red dress and 
boots, the stark contrast to her 
pale complexion, her white-
blonde curls, white nails and 
nude lip, to the Halloween-esque 
oversized belt, McCarthy stood 
out in the wrong way. The belted 
dress and thigh high boot com-
bination was more something 
Daphne Blake would wear than a 
former host of “The View.” Even 
for the red carpet, her look was 
too red. — Emma Kinery

BEST- SELENA GOMEZ

Selena Gomez stunned in a red 

sequin Givenchy midi-dress and 
Jimmy Choo strappy sandals. Her 
sleek middle part and long dark 
tresses paired perfectly with the 
sparkling ensemble. Her makeup 
— a deep red shadow and dark 
liner to match her power stare — 
made for one of the best looks of 
the night. The low-backed dress 
made Gomez appear elegant and 
confident; surely a certain ex-
boyfriend noticed. Along with 
her new album Revival, many 

have witnessed Gomez’s unbe-
lievable fashion revival. Credits 
are due to all-star stylist Kate 
Young (other clients include 
Sienna Miller, Dakota Johnson 
and Michelle Williams) who 
has the sartorial expertise to 
follow Gomez’s fervent return. 
— Mara MacLean

BEST- CIARA

For all intents and purposes, 

I want to clarify how anomalous 
this best dressed categorization 
is. Ciara, a now irrelevant celeb-
rity in everyone’s book, did a 
complete 180 when she stepped 
out in what may be the best Reem 
Acra gown of all time. Congrats, 
Ciara; you have officially come 
back into the relevant main-
stream, and your style is one 
to be reckoned with. It takes a 
certain amount of preparation 
and guts to step out in a sheer, 
black, floor-length, strategically 
embellished dress. The risk was 
well worth the reward, as she 
looked amazing in every way. — 
Mariam Sheikh

TV REVIEW
‘Chicago Med’ is 
standard ER fare

Latest in “Chicago” 
franchise another 
stale medical show

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Over the course of the past few 

seasons, NBC has shifted their 
programming following a decade 
of a low-rated 
shows. 
Riding 

off of the mas-
sive 
success 

of 
the 
“The 

Voice,” 
the 

network 
built 

a schedule out 
of 
procedur-

als, 
following 

a similar strat-
egy to CBS’s in 
the early 2000s 
(which led to the launch of “CSI” 
and “NCIS,” among others). A 
major part of that plan has been 
the “Chicago” block, created by 
the mind behind NBC’s other 
big franchise, Dick Wolf (“Law 
& Order”). Starting with the 
respectable hit “Chicago Fire” 
in 2012, the network has created 
a group of shows that don’t bring 
in the audience of an “NCIS,” but 
do keep the lights on in what used 
to be difficult timeslots for the 
network. The premeiere of “Chi-
cago Med” solidified the show 
as a representative entry of the 
franchise. It’s as generic as they 
come, but it will find an audience 
who enjoys medical dramas with 
help from a post-“Voice” timeslot.

“Chicago Med” follows a group 

of doctors at the fictional Chicago 
Medical. In the pilot, a subway 
train derails downtown, caus-
ing the hospital to overflow with 
patients. Witnessing the acci-
dent is the new trauma fellow, Dr. 
Connor Rhodes (Colin Donnell, 
“Arrow”), who’s in his first day 
on the job. The cast also includes 
S. Epatha Merkerson (“Law and 
Order”) as Chief of Services and 
Oliver Platt (“Fargo”) as the Chief 
of Psychiatry.

The show is a generic medi-

cal procedural, and it relishes 
the genre’s tenants; it’s full of the 
clichés that have defined dramas 
like “ER” and “Grey’s Anatomy.” 
There’s a cute male doctor attract-
ing the female staffers, morally 
ambiguous 
medical 
decisions, 

patients who die and doctors who 
save their patients in heartwarm-
ing fashion. There’s nothing in 
this show that hasn’t been done 
better before. The episode’s main 
story involves a surrogate mother 
with a critical brain injury. The 
baby’s parents, who have power of 
attorney, have to make a decision 
about a surgery which could save 
the surrogate’s life, but puts their 
child at risk. It was too famil-
iar to have an emotional impact. 
And how many times have medi-
cal shows put children in dan-
ger? The episode has a little girl 
come into the ER and go through 
a death scare. It doesn’t take 
enough time to establish her as a 
character instead of a type, which 
means the story lacks emotional 
impact and feels too familiar.

“Chicago 
Med” 
delivers 

its exposition in a clunky and 
forced way, which doesn’t help. 
Throughout the episode, it uses 
specific lines of dialogue to relay 
the backstory of characters. For 

example, when characters talk 
to pregnant ER-doctor Dr. Nata-
lie Manning (Torrey DeVitto, 
“One Tree Hill”), they empha-
size that she’s a single mother by 
saying the line “we’re not going 
to let you do this single mother 
thing by yourself.” This type of 
dialogue hits the viewer over 
the head with information that, 
while necessary, could have been 
delivered in a less on-the-nose 
manner. Still, the drama showed 
that it’s capable of revealing char-
acter facts without talking down 
to the viewer. In the pilot’s last 
act, Dr. Manning is in the locker 
room looking at a picture of her 
dead husband and she explains 
what happened and how much 
she struggled. This is how you 
deliver information to the viewer. 
Show without telling, and maybe 
lead the viewer to feel something 
while you’re at it.

“Chicago Med” is not a bad 

TV show; it just falls into many 
of the tropes of the medical 
drama, while not doing anything 
new with them. The show will 
attract viewers who like the doc-
tor genre and people who already 
watch the “Chicago” franchise. 
However, if a viewer doesn’t find 
himself within those groups, he 
shouldn’t bother.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Still dark and twisted 
on Ye’s masterpiece

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

I have been listening to 

so much Kanye West lately. 
Something 
about 
this 
pre-

Thanksgiving grind has had me 
craving his artful aggression. 
The countless tests, papers 
and homework assignments on 
crack — all are last-minute feats 
of strength designed to tickle 
our academic resilience. We’re 
burned out but we’re fighting to 
hold on. In these trying times, 
we need squirrel-ized, soulful 
Chaka Khan samples with bril-
liant, mordant lyrics on top. We 
need robot cacophony. We need 
a little Kanyeezy time.

Yeezus, West’s last album, has 

proven itself a prodigious stitch 
in the quilt of hip hop. By now, 
we all know those indecipher-
able opening moans on “Black 
Skinhead.” 
Uh 
huh, 
honey, 

we have seen that god-awful 
“Bound 2” video, and we’re well 
aware of the fact that “Blood 
on the Leaves” has a drop to 
make Skrillex weep for 40 days 
and 40 nights. Only a madman 
would dispute that Yeezus is, 
indeed, one of the best albums 
of the decade. Maybe West 
would go so far as to say “of all 
TIME.”

But this month marks the 

five-year anniversary of West’s 
oft-overlooked fifth album, My 
Beautiful Dark Twisted Fan-
tasy. A complex, disturbing 
beast it is, written on the heels 
of several embarrassing public 
incidents (shake it off, Taylor). 
Fantasy pulls from combat-
ing genres, opaque themes and 
synths galore. West has shelved 
the work as a mere “apology 

album” — a conglomeration of 
ways he wanted to better him-
self at the time it was created, 
which entailed a Hawaiian 
hiatus and necessary hairstyle 
improvements. But Fantasy is 
so much more than that.

The album is wild at its best: 

“Monster” is the violent peak 
of its zany energy, armed with 
Jay-Z and Nicki Minaj’s unde-
niable verbosity. The incom-
parable “POWER” dips into 
King Crimson’s 1969 prog-rock 
fixture “21st Century Schizoid 
Man,” and it’s accented with 
West’s increasingly belligerent, 
mounting power. “Hell of a Life” 
gives us the height of fame’s sin-
ful pleasures, and we feel the 
throwback groove of “Devil in 
a New Dress” with Rick Ross. 
Taken at surface value, Fantasy 
feels hype. Fun. Flirty.

The thematic nadir comes, 

though, when West flirts with 
heavier subject matter. “Blame 
Game,” featuring John Leg-
end, deals with infidelity and 
other personal qualms. And 
“So Appalled” is as catchy as 
it is serious, a cathartic ode to 
West’s 
outbursts. 
Ironically, 

Fantasy’s bleakest products are 
some of its best, an assertion 
summed up superbly on (my 
personal favorite) “Runaway.”

Watching the VMAs with 

my mom some five years ago, 
I vividly recall West standing 
completely alone on stage, lit-
tle white piano in front of him. 
He stepped up and just started 
banging it with one finger, hit-
ting these minimalistic, raw 
chalk-sounding notes that held 
both nothing and the world. 
This was the apology song to 
Swift, “Runaway.” And then 
the beat dropped, woven with 
repeated yells of “Look atcha!” 
(A part that still gives me chills, 
if I’m in the Yeezy mood.) Mom 
said, “What the hell is this? 
Why would you want to toast 
to douchebags?” Melina said, “I 
have no idea.” Melina thought, 
“This is absolutely incredible.”

There are a lot of people that 

don’t “get” Kanye West. They’re 
either so distracted by his col-
orful behavior, his marriage to 
the ever-eloquent Kardashian 
dame or they simply dismiss his 
music as “noisy rap crap.” But 
I can’t urge those listeners to 
move past these preconceived 
notions enough. Start with 
“Runaway.” Start with “Gor-
geous.” Start with My Beautiful 
Dark Twisted Fantasy. Though 
it doesn’t hit as high of a mark 
as Yeezus, it’s essential Kanye 
because it is so listenable — 
hostile, depressing, erratic and 
dark. It’s human, above all else.

Then again, “human” is not 

an apt moniker for West. He 
calls himself a God, a hybrid 
of Jesus and himself. But when 
I think about Kan, one barely 
audible exclamation from the 
intro to Jay-Z’s “Lucifer” plays 
over and again in my head: 
“Kanyeezy, you did it again! You 
a genius!” And I can’t hear any-
thing else.

Adele’s style is too 
much for us peasants

STYLE NOTEBOOK

By CARLY COLONNESE

Daily Arts Writer

With the release of “Hello” 

and her new album, 25, British-
singer/songwriter 
Adele 
has 

regained the world’s attention 
after a three-year hiatus. Adele 
is back with a vengeance, as 
a complete vocal and fashion 
powerhouse. Known for her vin-
tage-esque looks and mod-glam 
makeup and hair, Adele’s person-
al style has cultivated something 
analogous to her very essence.

Adele’s first album, 19, was 

released in 2008 and, as she 
ages, so does her style. She does 
so gracefully, as each year her 
clothing choices continue to 
raise the bar. She never fails to 
dress for her maturity or her 
body type. As someone who 
intrinsically dresses conserva-
tively, her style has evolved into 
something polished and true to 
herself. The phrase “dressing 
conservatively” often suggests 
negative connotations, but in 
Adele’s case, the phrase is syn-
onymous with a semblance of 
class in its purest form.

It seems that Adele’s go-to 

outfit for red carpet events is 
a Little Black Dress. For this, I 
can’t blame her; everyone looks 
amazing in black dresses. She 
loves mixing it up from the sim-
ple, more toned down LBD to 
variations with lots of sequins, 
sparkles, lace and beading. Of 
course, fancy or casual, Adele 
never fails to look flawless.

Adele makes up for her heav-

ily black — and what some would 
call minimalistic or plain — 
wardrobe with her retro hair 
and makeup. Her go-to makeup 
includes a matte face with heavy 
contoured cheekbones, subtle 
nude eyes and impeccably pre-
cise black winged eyeliner (seri-
ously, teach us peasants your 
ways!). Her effortlessly pouted 
lips are often colored nude, or 
occassionally red.

Adele has played around with 

her hair — bangs, no bangs, 
blonde or brunette. She tends to 
stick with medium to short cuts, 

always styled with big volume 
(think Jackie O hair). Even after 
years of hiatus, Adele hasn’t 
deviated from her style norm 
and signature cat eye in the 
emotional music video “Hello.” 
Whatever her hairdresser does 
now needs to stay, because she 
looks incredible not only in the 
music video, but all throughout 
her 25 press tour.

The green-hued black-and-

white music video opens with a 
sunglass-clad Adele in her newly 
lobbed (long bob) blonde locks 
blowing across her face, donned 
in a fringe-inspired fur coat 
with a plaid shirt underneath. 
Between her hair blowing and 
the shaggy coat, Adele adheres 
to her vintage-esque roots by 
dressing in a way that comes 
straight out of the ’70s.

Although the world knows of 

Adele’s weight loss (from nixing 
her smoking habit, going veg-
etarian and taking up jogging), 
Adele dresses in loose clothing 
and billowing coats to cover her 
frame, so viewers can’t explicit-
ly tell how much weight she has 
lost. When shots of her complete 
body are shown, the camera is 
very far away, diminishing her 
overall size. Unlike other celeb-
rities who go through major 
health 
transformations 
and 

subsequent weight loss (think 
Jessica Simpson and Jennifer 
Hudson) who are known to have 
very publicly showcased their 
fitness goals and achievements, 
“Hello” does quite the opposite. 
It also calls into question the 
way Adele displays her inher-
ent sexuality in her musical and 
personal style. Taking cues from 
older eras of entertainment and 
music, she uses not her body or 
her clothing choices, but instead 
her face, eyes and talent to evoke 
emotion from her listeners.

Like many other students 

here at the University, I can’t get 
enough of Adele (and “Hello”). 
With the first track from her 
new album, I can’t wait to see 
what the album holds, as well as 
what fashion Adele explores in 
future work. 

We all need a 
little Kanyeezy 

time.

‘M’ embarks on “business trip”

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

PARADISE ISLAND, The 

Bahamas 
— 
The 
Atlantis 

Paradise 
Island 
resort 
has 

all the makings of a perfect 
weeklong 
getaway 
spot. 

Palm trees line the property, 
balconies overlook the ocean, 
and get this: 
the 
resort 

doesn’t 
just 

feature a lazy 
river — it has 
a crazy river, 
too. But don’t 
tell 
that 
to 

Caris 
LeVert 

as 
his 
team 

gets 
ready 

for the Battle 
4 
Atlantis 

tournament. 
The 
senior 

guard 
didn’t 

come to the 
Bahamas 
so 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team could relax.

“They know we’re here on a 

business trip,” LeVert said of 
his teammates. “We know that 
we didn’t have a great game on 
Friday (against Xavier), and 
we’re here to redeem ourselves 
and play a great tournament.”

Michigan’s first test will 

be No. 18 Connecticut, a team 
that, like the Musketeers did 
on Friday, will challenge the 
Wolverines’ big men down 
low. The Huskies (3-0) feature 
center Amida Brimah, who’s 
averaging eight rebounds and 
nearly nine points per game.

Against Xavier, Michigan 

(2-1) got outrebounded, 47-29, 
and its bigs tallied 11 fouls and 
just nine points.

But Michigan coach John 

Beilein 
sees 
Brimah 
as 
a 

different kind of big man than 
what the Wolverines saw from 
the Musketeers.

“They’re not as apt to throw 

the ball in to (Brimah) the way 
that the traditional post-up that 
you saw with (Xavier forward) 
Jalen Reynolds,” Beilein said. 
“It’s more that he’s playing 
behind the defense. They’re 
lobbing it to him, so it’s a four 
(players) out, one (player) deep 
type of approach — very unique 
to what I’ve seen before.”

Beilein also knows Brimah 

will be a factor defensively, 
calling him “as good a shot 
blocker as there is.” The 7-foot 
junior is third in the country 
in blocked shots, averaging 4.3 
per game.

Offensively, Connecticut has 

been led by a duo of fifth-year 
graduate 
student 
transfers. 

Guard Sterling Gibbs comes 
to the Huskies after playing 
two seasons at Seton Hall, and 
forward Shonn Miller opted 
for Connecticut after playing 
four years at Cornell. The two 
are pacing 16 and 13 points per 
game, respectively, and Miller 

has also been a force on the 
boards, using a 6-foot-7, 220-
pound frame to grab more than 
six boards per contest.

“They hit the jackpot with 

the fifth-year guys,” Beilein 
said. “That’s a huge advantage 
to have guys that have those 
type of numbers and all of a 
sudden have for another year.”

Connecticut has also gotten 

major 
contribution 
from 

younger 
players 
in 
guard 

Rodney Purvis and forward 
Daniel Hamilton.

Purvis 
starts 
at 
guard 

alongside Gibbs and is the 
Huskies’ biggest threat from 
deep, shooting 47 percent from 
3-point range. Hamilton, while 
not as consistent a shooter, 
poses a threat solely in his 
versatility.

“He’s a point guard one 

minute,” Beilein said. “Then he 
can play a ‘1,’ a ‘2,’ a ‘3’ or a ‘4’. 
They can go small, and he can 
play ‘4’ or he can play the ‘5’ 

even. There’s a lot of versatility 
that you see.”

Hamilton’s ability to play 

different spots makes him a 
tough matchup, one that will 
likely fall to Michigan’s best 
defender: LeVert. Beilein said 
he has ideas as to how to stop 
Hamilton, but didn’t specify 
what they were.

If 
Michigan’s 
big 
men 

underperform again, Hamilton 
may 
be 
the 
least 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
worries. 
Junior 

forward 
Mark 
Donnal 
has 

started at the ‘5’ in each game 
so far, but Beilein hinted 
earlier in the week that he was 
reevaluating that spot in the 
starting lineup and wanted to 
shorten the rotation across the 
board. Sophomore Ricky Doyle 
has 
been 
Michigan’s 
most 

efficient big and could slide 
into Donnal’s starting spot.

If 
Doyle 
can’t 
step 
up, 

though, it could be a rocky start 
to the Bahamas business trip.

Viewing guide to 
Battle 4 Atlantis

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

PARADISE 
ISLAND, 
The 

Bahamas — Don’t let the fancy 
resort and tropical destination 
fool you — the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team 
views 
its 

southward swing to The Bahamas 
over the Thanksgiving holiday as 
a business trip.

The Battle 4 Atlantis, hosted by 

the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort 
just off the shores of Nassau, 
Bahamas, packs a punch in its 
lineup this year. The tournament 
features No. 10 Gonzaga, No. 18 
Connecticut, No. 25 Texas A&M, 
Syracuse, 
Texas, 
Charlotte, 

Washington and Michigan.

Round 1

Michigan takes on No. 18 

Connecticut at 9:30 p.m. EST on 
Wednesday. The game will be 
broadcast on AXS TV, and caps off 
the first tournament quadruple-
header of the week.

Round 2

If the Wolverines beat the 

Huskies, 
they’ll 
play 
either 

Charlotte 
or 
Syracuse 
the 

following day. A win would pit 
them against that game’s victor in 
a 3:30 p.m. matchup, broadcast on 
ESPN. Lose to Connecticut, and 
they’ll tip off once again at 9:30 
p.m. against the loser — another 
AXS Broadcast.

Round 3

With two wins, the Wolverines 

will play on Friday against 
whichever team in the group of 
Texas, Texas A&M, Gonzaga 
and Washington escapes the 
tournament’s first two days with 

a 2-0 record. Regardless, they’ll 
play one of those teams in the final 
round.

At 2-0, Michigan would play 

at 3:00 p.m. on ESPN. If the 
Wolverines beat Connecticut but 
lose on Thanksgiving Day, they 
would play at 12:30 p.m., also on 
ESPN. A first-round loss followed 
by a win would have them tip off at 
7:00 p.m. on AXS, and two losses 
would result in a 9:30 p.m. tip on 
AXS to close the tournament.

Breakdown:

Michigan faces another tough 

test Wednesday in Connecticut 
center Amida Brimah. At 7 feet, 
he presents another physical, 
low-post presence — he won’t 
score as much as Xavier’s 6-foot-
10 Jalen Reynolds did on Friday, 
and the Huskies’ offense won’t 
run through him, but he’ll present 
a major issue on the glass at both 
ends of the floor. 

The Wolverines should feel 

better about playing Syracuse the 
next day. Michigan got past Jim 
Boeheim’s trademark 2-3 zone last 
December at Crisler Center, and 
the Wolverines’ deep, experienced 
backcourt has the patience and 
shooting ability necessary to find 
space around the perimeter to 
win the game from the 3-point 
line. Charlotte, meanwhile, is a 
program looking to retool under 
first-year head coach Mark Price. 

And while Texas A&M posts 

a stiff secondary challenge in 
the other bracket, it’s tough to 
envision any team in the field 
handling 
Gonzaga 
and 
Kyle 

Wiltjer, a 6-foot-10 forward who 
has clear star potential in the 
NBA. The Bulldogs are the clear 
favorites in this tournament, and 
the Wolverines wouldn’t fare well 
against Wiltjer if they faced him.

Michigan announces 2016 
seven-man recruiting class

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

With 
the 
conclusion 
of 

the early signing period, the 
Michigan hockey team has 
added seven players who will 
don the maize and blue sweater 
for the 2016-17 season.

During 
the 
past 
two 

campaigns, the Wolverines have 
brought in freshman classes 
that made immediate impacts 
on the ice.

In 2014, freshman forward 

Dylan Larkin was a catalyst 
behind 
a 
high-powered 

Michigan offense. He tallied 
47 points, good for second 
on the team in scoring. On 
the opposite end of the ice, 
freshman 
defenseman 
Zach 

Werenski finished seventh in 
points and had the highest tally 
of any defenseman on the team. 
Werenski also finished plus-
nine and quickly established 
himself as one of the young 
leaders 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defensive zone.

This season, the freshman 

impact is even more impressive.

Forwards Cooper Marody, 

Kyle 
Connor 
and 
Brendan 

Warren are Michigan’s top 
three point scorers with 11, 
10 and nine, respectively. And 
though freshmen defensemen 
Joseph Cecconi and Nicholas 
Boka’s statistics aren’t eye-
popping, the pair has stepped 
up to play every game so far.

Now, Michigan coach Red 

Berenson has brought in seven 
skaters that could likely have 
the same influence in 2016.

The 
seven-man 
group 

includes five players from the 
United States National Team 
Development 
Program 
— 

forwards Will Lockwood, Nick 
Pastujov and James Sanchez, 
along with defensemen Griffin 
Luce and Luke Martin.

Lockwood, 
a 
Bloomfield 

Hills, 
Michigan, 
native, 
is 

the son of former Wolverine 
forward Joe Lockwood. The 

young forward has accumulated 
13 points in 20 games with the 
U-18 squad. Though he may be 
considered undersized at 5-foot-
11, 172 pounds, Lockwood is 
said to have good hands and an 
impressive hockey IQ.

Pastujov has accumulated 

just two goals and three assists 
through 20 games with the 
USNTDP this year, but his 
performance on the ice in 2014 
is much more encouraging. 
The prospect from Bradenton, 
Florida, 
finished 
fourth 
in 

scoring last year after racking 
up 30 points in 
45 games.

Rounding 

out 
the 

forwards from 
the USNTDP, 
Sanchez — an 
Illinois native 
— has notched 
two goals and 
two assists in 
20 games this 
season.

The three forwards have 

all been classified as fourth- 
to 
sixth-round 
NHL 
Draft 

candidates on the NHL Central 
Scouting 
Preliminary 
2016 

Players to Watch list.

Martin 
and 
Luce, 
the 

defensemen, have each played 
every game of the season 
with the USNTDP and have 
tallied seven and three points, 
respectively.

Luce may be the most college-

ready recruit in the class, as he 
was projected to be a potential 
second- or third-round pick by 
NHL Central Scouting.

The five skaters earned a 

silver medal together during the 
U-17 World Hockey Challenge, 
and 
the 
chemistry 
they 

established could be invaluable 
during their transition to Yost 
Ice Arena next year.

This season, every freshman 

played with at least one other 
player on the team — whether 
fellow rookies or Wolverine 
veterans — prior to arriving in 

Ann Arbor, and it appears to be 
paying dividends.

The final two recruits — 

defenseman Christian Meike 
and forward Steven Merl — 
share experience in the United 
States Hockey League.

Merl currently plays for the 

Bloomington Thunder, but also 
spent time with the Muskegon 
Lumberjacks in 2014. Through 
15 games this year, Merl has 
lined up primarily at center, 
accumulating one goal and 
two assists. He hails from 
Bloomfield, making him one of 

two Michigan 
natives in the 
class.

Meike’s 

numbers have 
been the same 
as Merl’s after 
recovering 
from 
a 

significant 
injury in 2014. 
One 
concern 

is that he may 

be undersized for a defenseman 
at just 6-foot, 172 pounds. But 
his recovery from injury is 
encouraging, and he has scored 
one goal and notched two assists 
in 10 games this season for the 
Sioux City Musketeers.

While the 2016 class has big 

skates to fill after the production 
from freshmen in the last two 
seasons, 
Michigan 
associate 

head coach Billy Powers is 
confident in the group he has 
brought to Ann Arbor.

“You’re 
always 
recruiting 

based on your needs, and we 
feel strongly that we’ve added 
the right pieces and most 
importantly the right kind of 
kids,’’ Powers told MGoBlue.
com. “Our current freshman 
class has stepped in and had an 
impact on our team, and a big 
part of it is their character. We 
feel like we’ve found a group to 
come in next year with similar 
qualities. You’re going to see the 
right kind of kids, and that is 
going to help our program.’’

Unbothered by struggles, 
Flaherty has career game

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

Something felt a bit off 

about Katelynn Flaherty’s shot 
throughout the first couple 
games of the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s season, so the 
sophomore guard put in a few 
more reps on the Crisler Center 
hardwood, sinking baskets late 
into the night.

She 
needed 
every 
extra 

minute she could get in front 
of the basket. Ten days ago 
against Detroit, Flaherty had 
her weakest performance of the 
season with a scoreless second 
half and four total fouls. After 
that win, though, senior guard 
Madison Ristovski said she 
believed Flaherty would fall 
back in line.

Four days later, Flaherty led 

the team with 19 points against 
Xavier. And four days after 
that, with more practice under 
her belt and a few extra nights 
of shooting, the upward trend 
continued in the Wolverines’ 
119-61 
victory 
over 
South 

Carolina Upstate.

That turnaround made quite 

a statement, too, as Flaherty 
etched 
her 
name 
in 
the 

program’s record book with a 
career-high 34 points.

With 

65-percent 
shooting, 
Flaherty 
joined 
seven 
other 

players in the 
program’s 
history 
to 

have 
scored 

at least 34 points in a single 
game — including former guard 
Shannon Smith, who scored 36 
points against Ohio State last 
season.

Despite small turbulence to 

start the season, the stat sheet 
will show that Flaherty has 
recuperated. For her, it has 
been a mental game that has 
progressed substantially.

“She’s an incredible player,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico. “(But) she’s kinda 
been disappointed in the first 
couple games that her shot 
hadn’t been falling the way that 
she’d been working on it.”

Against the Spartans, her 

shots did fall the way she 
wanted, but not initially. She 
started the game by missing 
three straight 3-pointers and a 
jumper before drawing a foul, 
stepping to the line and sinking 
two free throws. After that, 
Flaherty was unstoppable with 
the finesse of her dribbling and 
quick transitions on the fast 
break.

“I think that (Detroit) was 

a good game for me to go 
through,” Flaherty said. “It 
changed my whole mentality 
coming 
into 
games 
going 

forward. Especially going 0-for-
4 in the beginning (of Monday’s 
game), it doesn’t faze me. I just 
keep shooting.”

And Flaherty kept shooting 

Monday. It didn’t seem like she 
would miss.

It seemed that Flaherty just 

needed to see the swish of the 
ball through the basket — even 
if it was just a free throw. In the 
end, it’s about confidence with 
Flaherty, and one basket could 

be the tipping 
point 
for 
a 

phenomenal 
night.

“Maybe the 

free 
throws 

kinda calmed 
her down a bit, 
and she didn’t 
miss 
after 

that,” Barnes Arico said. “Every 
time she shoots it, I think 
it’s going in. I think probably 
everybody on our bench thinks 
it’s going in. When she misses, 
we’re surprised that she misses 
it.”

Flaherty missed just seven 

of 20 shots, but Barnes Arico 
thought her four assists were 
her most impressive stat line. 

Flaherty’s 
distribution 
set 

up 
freshman 
guard 
Boogie 

Brozoski 
for 
a 
career-high 

16-point night.

In turn, Brozoski had five 

assists, the most important one 
coming with 1:23 left in the 
game. Ten seconds after subbing 
in, redshirt senior guard Halle 
Wangler got wide open at the 
top of the key and scored a long 
jumper off a pass from Brozoski.

Wangler’s first career basket 

made the bench uproar in 
excitement, sending players and 
coaches jumping on their feet. 
Twenty-one seconds later, she 
added her first career rebound 
as 
well. 
Without 
Brozoski, 

Wangler wouldn’t have had 
that shining moment. Without 
Flaherty, there’s no telling if 
Brozoski would’ve produced 
similar results.

Ultimately, Flaherty’s career 

night paid dividends for the 
performance 
of 
her 
other 

teammates.

“She 
was 
making 
extra 

passes, and she wasn’t forcing 
her shot,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
was really happy with the way 
she moved the ball.”

Barnes Arico said she didn’t 

know how many points Flaherty 
had when she subbed out in the 
final six minutes, nearing 40 
points. The fourth-year coach 
said Flaherty would likely play 
all 40 minutes of a game if she 
could, but Flaherty admitted 
that it wouldn’t be to score more 
points.

“I just want to do what’s best 

for my team, and just help my 
team win in whichever way I 
can,” Flaherty said. “I think 
when (I) have high scoring 
games, I also want to work on 
other parts of my game, whether 
it’s sharing the ball, getting the 
ball in other people’s hands or 
working on defense.”

No matter how Flaherty 

spends every minute on the 
floor, though, she needs to do 
one thing. Just keep shooting, 
and the rest will fall in place.

They joined 
Michigan fans 
at Forest Hill 

Cemetery

By MAX COHEN 

Managing Sports Editor

Jeff 
Holzhausen 
laughed 

when 
he 
heard 
that 
Jim 

Harbaugh might be interested 
in joining his yearly tradition.

Each 
year 
since 
1997, 

Holzhausen has gathered a 

group of Michigan fans to walk 
to the graves of former Michigan 
announcer Bob Ufer and former 
Michigan coach Fielding Yost 
before the Wolverines play Ohio 
State. Former Michigan coach 
Bo Schembechler’s grave was 
added in 2007 after he passed 
away before the Ohio State game 
in 2006.

But never had there been 

a participant of Harbaugh’s 
stature.

Holzhausen first heard of 

Harbaugh’s interest in attending 
six weeks ago, but he didn’t 
fully 
believe 
the 
Michigan 

football coach would actually 
show up until he did. His 
appearance meant a great deal 
to Holzhausen.

“You’re going to tell me the 

guy’s a flight risk to the NFL 
when on a Tuesday night before 
the biggest game of the year, he’s 
out here?” Holzhausen said.

Holzhausen estimated that 

200 people showed up to the 
Forest Hill Cemetery Tuesday 
night. Harbaugh joined in right 
as the group arrived at the grave 
of Schembechler, his former 
college coach.

When 
Harbaugh 
arrived, 

Holzhausen said, he spoke a 
few words about Schembechler. 
He attributed all of his success 
to things he learned from 
Schembechler, and discussed 
how much his college coach 
meant to him.

Then Holzhausen handed 

Harbaugh a maize and blue 
hammer and a buckeye nut. 
It has been a tradition for 
Holzhausen and his friends 
to smash a buckeye nut when 
they tailgate before Michigan 
football games, and they did 
the same thing when they first 
walked 
to 
Schembechler’s 

grave in 2007. Harbaugh joined 
their ranks in the tradition 
Tuesday.

But after Harbaugh left and 

much of the crowd dispersed, 
there was one more surprise 
visitor for Holzhausen. That 
was Michigan 
fifth-year 
senior 
quarterback 
Jake Rudock, 
who 
also 

showed up at 
the cemetary. 
As a transfer 
to 
Michigan, 

he had never 
taken part in 
the tradition, 
but his father told him about it 
when they talked on the phone 
Monday.

“My dad had found out about 

it and said it’s just a pretty cool 
thing,” 
Rudock 
said. 
“He’s 

never heard of 
anything like 
that.” 

Rudock has 

made his mark 
on 
Michigan 

history 
in 

his lone year 
playing for the 
Wolverines, 
becoming 
the 
first 

quarterback 

in team history to throw for 
more than 250 yards in three 
consecutive games Saturday. But 
while he’s in Ann Arbor, Rudock 

has also taken the opportunity 
to learn about Michigan history. 
His family members frequently 
tell him new facts, and he hears 
tidbits from fans as well.

Tuesday 
night, 
Rudock 

got to experience the history 
firsthand. 
He 
walked 
to 

Schembechler’s grave, and like 
Harbaugh, smashed the buckeye 
nut.

Rudock then walked with 

Holzhausen and the group to 
the graves of Ufer and Yost. The 
fans in attendance made sure 
to watch out for Rudock when 
he walked on the icy trail of the 
cemetery, just days before the 
biggest game of his career.

“If 
Jake 
slips, 
someone 

throw yourself under him,” one 
member of the group joked.

Rudock paid his respects 

at the graves before heading 
back to the rigor of game week. 
Holzhausen was impressed by 
both Harbaugh and Rudock 
during the tradition.

“Both of them, it talks about 

their commitment to Michigan, 
their 
love 
of 
Michigan,” 

Holzhausen said.

After the coach and his 

quarterback showed up, it will 
not be difficult for Holzhausen 
to rank his favorite moments 
from the 19-year tradition.

“1A and 1B,” he said.

Wolverines look for better 
defense against Ohio State

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Six weeks ago, Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh reached 
into his bank of allusions for a 
motivational tool. That week, the 
Wolverines took on Michigan 
State, which had dominated 
them for the previous two years 
by an average of 23.5 points.

Harbaugh urged his team 

to move past that history, 
referencing a quote from “The 
Lion King”: “The past can hurt. 
You can either run from it, or 
embrace it and learn from it.”

Fast forward to this week, 

when the No. 10 Michigan 
football team (6-1 Big Ten, 9-2 
overall) hosts Ohio State, and the 
quote applies again — especially 
for Michigan’s defense. The 
Wolverines have kept the past 
two meetings with the Buckeyes 
close, losing on a last-minute 
two-point conversion in 2013 

and falling behind only late in 
the game last season. But the 
defense has been the issue, 
allowing 42 points in each of 
those games.

“You can’t worry about the 

past,” said junior safety Dymonte 
Thomas. “The past is the past for 
a reason. The only thing you can 
do is look forward, so the only 
thing we’re looking forward to is 
the game Saturday.”

The Buckeyes have averaged 

471 yards in the past two games 
against Michigan, including 313 
on the ground at 7.4 per carry. 
Quarterback J.T. Barrett broke 
his foot in last year’s game, but 
only after totaling 265 yards 
and three touchdowns. He will 
be back under center against 
Michigan on Saturday.

“But this year, we’re a new 

team,” Thomas said. “We’ve got 
a new coaching staff. And we’ve 
got a lot of players stepping it up 
this year.”

While the Buckeyes gashed 

two solid Michigan defenses in 
the past two years, this year’s 
edition is even better. Despite 
struggles against opponents such 
as Minnesota and Indiana in the 
second half of the season, the 
Wolverines appear to be back on 
track after a strong performance 
at Penn State. They’re focused on 
replicating games like those, not 
specifically on improving from 
two 
lackluster 
performances 

against Ohio State.

“If we do our techniques and 

our fundamentals, it’s kind of 
hard to beat us,” said senior 
safety Jarrod Wilson. “So we’re 
just worried about ourselves.”

Neither the coaches nor the 

players have discussed past 
games against the Buckeyes, 
according to Wilson, but they 
still have their keys to this 
week’s game.

They have to limit Ohio State’s 

“explosive players,” as Wilson 
called them: Barrett, running 
back Ezekiel Elliott and wide 
receivers Michael Thomas and 
Braxton Miller. In preparation 
for Saturday’s game, Michigan 
watched different clips of every 
game the Buckeyes have played 
this season.

That 
practice 
helps 
the 

Wolverines stay focused on 
this week, though no game of 
the rivalry exists in a vacuum. 
Wilson, who is from Akron, 
Ohio, still talks to former players 
about their careers. Their record 
against Ohio State is always one 
of the first topics to come up. 
Wilson, meanwhile, is 0-3, which 
gives him extra motivation for 
Senior Day on Saturday.

“It’s always an extra edge — 

one last time to give it all I got 
and hopefully come out with a 
win,” he said.

Recent history is not on 

Wilson’s side, but that’s only 
history. The Wolverines are 
confident this year will be 
different.

“Of 
course,” 
said 
junior 

defensive end Taco Charlton. 
“That’s why we’re playing. It’s a 
new year, new game.”

Jarrod Wilson and Michigan’s defense will look to improve against Ohio State.

THE statement

“My initial vision (for the store) was from growing up in New 
York City, in Brooklyn, and seeing the Fourth Ave. bookstores. 

It’s funny that I just happened to be by these famous 

bookstores. What interested me was that the booksellers were 
so knowledgeable about everything they had — the places were 
often swamped with things you couldn’t find — but the owners 
knew where everything was. I’m kind of the same way now. I 
can locate anything if you ask for it. The difference between 

them and me is that I am literate. They were illiterate, but they 

knew books. They knew what the books were and what they 

were worth, but they didn’t ever read them!

In a sentimental mood

I 

truly admire J.K. Rowling. I realize 
this isn’t the most controversial state-
ment, and it’s probably a sentiment 

that most people share. Her crowning 
achievement, to me, was the ascension of 
her books to actual pop culture phenom-
enon. Where today we line up outside 
movie theaters for midnight premieres, we 
waited then outside Borders for midnight 
releases. Where we wait months for the 
trailer of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” 
we waited years for the release of “Deathly 
Hallows.”

This is what amazes me about Harry 

Potter. The concept of books being a bona 
fide national obsession among people our 
age seems to have been a casualty from TV 
and film’s rise to the top of the pop culture 
food chain. More people binge-watch than 
read for pleasure, and it’s not for lack of 
time. Yet, we’ll always have Harry Potter.

And truthfully, the series’ quality is 

irrelevant. The things we held close to our 
chest in childhood we hold even closer in 
our adulthood. An objectively bad movie 
(“Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Men-
ace”) is considered an all-time classic (by 
me) simply because of its association with 
a faintly remembered youth.

The power of sentimentality is one of 

my favorite things about life. It makes me 
incredibly, inexplicably happy that we look 
at everything from our formative years in 
the most crimson of rose-tinted glasses. It’s 
why I defend “The Office” so fiercely and 

love Batman like I love my grandmother. 
There’s a VHS tape of the Backstreet 
Boys’ official Black & Blue tour sitting 
somewhere in my house; I watched it over 
and over as a child, and I’ll never get rid of 
it. And no one will ever convince me that 
“Space Jam” got bad reviews.

Is this worth it, though? Do we lose some 

sort of critical edge if we turn a blind eye 
to the things we grew up with? To grow 
up playing football would likely lead to a 
reluctance to answer uncomfortable con-
versations about concussions in the sport. 
To spend one’s youth going hunting would 
likely translate to a reluctance toward gun 
control. Unfortunately, it seems senti-
mentality is often our biggest obstacle to 
change, as well. 

To be sure, this is a long line to draw. 

Assigning sentimental value to certain 
concepts is a naturally human occurrence, 
but it can also be dangerous. I grow too 
attached to movies, books, shows, people, 
things from my childhood for which I can 
often never see the other side, and I’ve been 
alarmed at the degree to which this is true. 
It’s odd, I know, to analyze the idea of being 
attached to things from your childhood, 
and it’s something probably no one has 
ever done before because no one has ever 
even thought about why it’s necessary, but I 
think it’s worth noting. It’s a concept that’s 
so universal, so ingrained that we never 
stop to think about why it is such, and that 
in itself is an important process.

Dear Emma,

As a woman, I’ve been encountering situa-

tions where I feel like I have to reconcile two 
very different sets of expectations for myself. 
Professionally, women are becoming more able 
to have significant roles as leaders in society. 
But then personally I feel like I’m supposed to 
do the opposite and take up as little space as pos-
sible (both in conversations or, literally, in the 
room) and be, well, pretty all of the time. How 
do I deal with feeling like I have to be two differ-
ent people and walk this fine line?

Sincerely,
Finding a Fit

***

Dear Finding a Fit,

Women engage in this kind of self-monitoring 

almost constantly, spending valuable time and 
space in our minds on trivial concerns such as our 
appearance.

It’s the age-old celebrity complaint: Splash the 

word “anorexic” over my face on your magazine’s 
cover, then put me on “baby-watch” if I gain five 
pounds. Women just can’t win sometimes.

We are liberated and equal and free to do what 

we want as women — but those of us who go to bars 
are expected to wear the same skin-baring clothing 
in the Skeeps line, snow or otherwise. As women, 
our sexualities are policed. We are supposed to be 
attractive but walk, like you said, a very thin line — 
careful not to breach into the dreaded territory of 
“slut.”

It’s like this.
Society: You should be a young, sexy, attractive 

woman. You are a sexual being. Flaunt it. Enjoy 
being objectified — it’s a compliment.

*Woman wears hella cute body con mini-dress 

with iridescent sequins around the v-neck top*

Society: You’re dressing too provocatively, your 

dress is too short, too much of your cleavage is 
exposed. It’s like you’re asking for it. Slut. How can 
anyone respect you professionally if you dress like 
that?

This is part of being a woman: mastering this 

dichotomy. We are perpetually dealing with the 
systematic, daily commercialization of our bodies. 
But as we encroach (theoretically) more and more 
into the professional world, how are we to behave?

I walked into my always-chatty 11:30 a.m. class 

a few weeks ago wearing the same shoes I always 
wear, the same pair of fleece leggings I slip on when 
it’s a little chilly out, and the red button down flan-
nel shirt I wear in the fall. My bangs are growing 
out so I put my hair in a bun to keep it out of my 
eyes — nothing out of the ordinary. A male student 
approached me and asked me a) if I had an exam 
coming up or something of that nature or b) if I was 
sick.

I have been asked maybe a dozen times in my 

life if I am sick on the days I don’t wear makeup or 
don’t straighten my hair (which are often). These 
men, the ones that ask me this, clearly have spent no 
real time with a woman. They have specific expec-
tations for my appearance and they are more than 
willing to make it known when those expectations 
are not met.

It’s that moment two days into midterms when 

your male friend whispers about a female fellow 
classmate’s armpit hair, scowling and scrunching 
up his nose. It’s the girl not wearing the bikini she 
loves and it’s the girl next to her, wearing the bikini, 
whose body is automatically scrutinized by every-
one walking by. I catch myself doing it.

So talk to other women about this. If I feel like I 

can’t walk into class with my hair in a bun without 
being assumed to have fallen ill, other women have 
experienced this.

The expectation to look “good” (good as defined 

by some other absurd standard) while perform-
ing to the same (higher?) caliber as men in your 
position exists. And this is just one example of the 
conflicting expectations society has for women. Be 
conscious of it, talk about it, make others aware of 
this feeling of duality, share your experience. Don’t 
let these confusing expectations determine how 
you will behave.

Sincerely,
Emma

generational differences around a turkey-laden table can often be a 
stressful mindfield. Here are a few suggestions for destabilizing con-

versation topics.

I 

have bought more books in the past month than I have 
time to read. They pile on my nightstand, my desk, and 
the corners of my bedroom, and I tell myself I’ll read 

them when I no longer have to read for my classes. But then 
I find a book that I simply consume, all at once, as if time 
doesn’t exist until it’s finished.

I didn’t expect my quest to visit bookstores in Ann Arbor to 

land me with a bunch of new titles. Then again, try to spend 
time in any local store and leave empty handed — it doesn’t 
happen.

As a child I grew up next to a Borders in Ann Arbor before 

the company went out of business. My mother would take me 
and my brothers, and we’d each go home with new books, 
excited to curl up on the couch and start reading. I’d nearly 
forgotten what that felt like until now.

Borders is out of business, but local bookstores thrive in 

Ann Arbor. They cater to every appetite, every niche, and I’ve 
only ventured to five of them. What possibilities exist for book 
lovers in this town! Endless run-ins with bookish strangers 
in the coziest kinds of spaces. As winter descends upon this 
city, I’ll retreat to the bookstores and their old-book smells, 
clacking typewriter keys, and burning incense. Or, I’ll stay in 
— make tea, curl up with a book and devour it.

Winter is coming.

I enter Dawn Treader on a Thursday. In the early evening, 

it has just begun to rain, and I fear, combined with the wind, 
there may be no leaves on the trees by the time I leave.

Heavily discounted book carts line the entryway, a lure 

for the forlorn bibliophile. Inside, a bowl of candy sits on the 

counter next to the register with no one behind it. I want a 
miniature Milky Way. A woman with a sprawling, circular 
metal tree necklace sits on the floor with stacks of books 
around her. I can’t tell if she works here or not, but she’s lost 
in thought and doesn’t look up.

As I head farther back, the smell of once-damp pages and 

literary dust sets in. I breathe. It’s as though every corner I 
turn may hide a some new figure — an older gentleman with 
a thick green coat and a beanie, a couple that turns to one 
another and remark, “books on books!”

I pace the store’s maze-like footprint a few times to get the 

general layout. Up and down, down and up, there are faces 
everywhere I turn; yet somehow, the quiet settles around me. 
I venture deeper into the cavernous depths, past the glass 
cases filled with yellowing pages. A life-size Egyptian statue 

stands watch. Immensely large African masks hang through-
out, staring. Cultural artifacts fill the place — there are even 
Star Trek cutouts in the Sci-Fi section.

A humming sound buzzes from above me. I look up. Glass 

ceiling panes are the backdrop to Star Wars battleship repli-
cas, as if the ships were truly within the gray sky. I pause to 
watch them in flight and feel lucky to have noticed. No build-
ings or birds obscure my view. It’s just me, a life-size Captain 
Jean-Luc Picard, and the soaring Millennium Falcon.

The humming follows me through the store. At one point, a 

section of squeaky floor groans at me. Amid the lack of voices, 
I smile at this misplaced cry.

I make my way to the fiction aisle. Stools dot the floor 

every few paces, like a self-service setup for the ceiling-high 
shelves. I stop directly in front of the “F” section and begin 
eyeing it for my writers.

A Faulkner catches my eye. Grabbing a stool to retrieve it, 

I realize my backpack blocks the whole aisle. As I look down, 
a young man with blond hair and a stubby ponytail momen-
tarily meets my eyes before darting behind another shelf in a 
Houdini-esque vanishing act. Just as I begin to believe that 
the store facilitates acts of illusion, he materializes on my 
other side.

I take down the “The Sound and the Fury,” and despite its 

crumpled cover, I want it. It smells that certain way: a bit like 
my grandfather’s house and cool, earthy dirt.

To leave the aisle, I dance around the man with the blond 

ponytail, and head to the front. A man now stands behind the 
register, and he lets out a big sigh as I approach the counter.

Me too, I want to say. Winter is coming.
Before heading out the door, I turn from the counter to see 

if the man with the ponytail found what he was looking for 
— he’s holding a book fraying along its amber spine, and the 
pages are close to his face.

I put the Faulkner in my backpack, though I worry about 

the condition of the cover. The wind whips through the open 
door, and leaves scatter on the welcome mat. I leave without 
taking a miniature Milky Way.

With one backward glance to where the man stood before 

heading out the door, I notice that he’s gone: no ponytail or 
frayed edges in sight. Simply vanished.

You can lock me out, but I can’t lock you in.

Another Thursday, and old-book smell accosts me. This, 

I think, is what happiness smells like. Inside Kaleidoscope 
Books & Collectibles there are piles of books everywhere I 
look, floor to ceiling, and the aisles are so tight that I tread 
cautiously to avoid knocking down any prized items.

I say hello to the store owner in the center of the room, hid-

den by a labyrinth of books, shelves, and glass cases.

“Is there anything in particular you’re looking for?” he 

asks.

“I’m just looking around,” I say, but soon realize I am so 

overwhelmed by the number of books that I don’t know 
where to start.

I let my hands wander over titles I have never heard of, 

picking up books with embossed covers and faded pages. To 
enter one aisle, I push against a door that emits a tremendous 
squeak. 

Almost on instinct, I search for the classics. After the 

owner helps a man looking for old Spiderman comics, he once 
again directs his attention at me.

I ask him if he has any poetry.
The first book he placed in my hands was a heavy edition of 

a classical poet, whose name I didn’t quite catch.

“This just came in today,” he tells me.
I am reminded of medieval illuminated manuscripts with 

their gold leaf and Celtic knots. The cover is green, and I am in 
love. All I can muster in response to the book was, “So beauti-
ful.”

Beautiful, because I didn’t know who the poet was and I 

didn’t want to admit that. He shows me a copy of “Wuthering 
Heights,” to which I respond, “Beautiful, it’s beautiful.” I tell 

him I have a much less beautiful copy of “Wuthering Heights.” 
The book rests next to a stack of huge, elegant Bibles. While I 
am tempted, it’s a bit out of a college student’s price range — 
after all, it was a collectible.

I drop my backpack to slip between the set of shelves and 

get a closer look. Behind one shelf, piles of posters and books 
are scattered on the ground. I wonder if the owner knew, or 
if he cared.

As I look — and impulsively touch every volume that 

intrigues me — the owner calls me over to look at a series of 
chapbooks filled with poetry. He gestures to a colorful one 
with big, loopy lettering on the front and tells me how it’s his 
own publication, a story he had told his son when he was four 
years old that made his son want to be a writer.

“Really?” I ask.
The chapbook is called, “The Day He Refused to be Silent.” 

I thumb through, and comment on how great it was that his 
son had published it for him. He shows me another one, which 
I flip over to see who wrote it.

“Who is Isaac?”
“That’s my son.”
He tells me this was the work that had truly made his son a 

writer, and that it was about his wife. His wife had fallen and 
hit her head, and she didn’t have a high chance of surviving. 
He explained to me that the day she was out of the hospital, 
Isaac had presented the chapbook.

He says it’s a very special thing — no matter how success-

ful he becomes as a writer. This will always be the best thing. 
 

I buy Isaac’s chapbook. As he rings me up, my eyes continue 

to wander around the shop.

“What a cool cash register,” I tell him.
It looks vintage with its large, round keys and still rang 

sharply when the drawer opens.

“You know, there’s a whole basement, too,” the owner says.
“How do I get to it?”
“Downstairs. You want to go downstairs?”
“Sure.”
As we walk down the stairs together, I have second 

thoughts. I ask if people actually visited the basement, and he 
says they do, every day. He fiddles with a set of keys.

“It won’t lock me in here, will it?” I ask, jokingly.
“You can lock me out, but I can’t lock you in.”
We both laugh.
The door shuts behind me — the deadbolt blocking the 

door from fully closing — and I stand alone in the basement. 
I breathe in the musk and start exploring. In addition to 
the books, there are artifacts and collectibles everywhere. I 
stumble upon a stack of old Sports Illustrated Magazines and 
think of my dad. In one corner, two old gumball machines rest 
against each other, both full of colorful candy melted against 
the glass. I find a poster that reads, “It’s difficult to soar with 
eagles when you work with turkeys.” I laugh aloud and con-
sider buying it.

After a while, the air begins to taste too stale and stagnant 

to continue browsing. Flipping the lights off, I head back up 
the stairs. The owner is sitting outside the shop, next to a table 
of books. We wish each other well and I am on my way, clutch-
ing Isaac’s chapbook at my side. 

Do you know Mary, Queen of Scots?

There is no one inside except the man behind the counter 

as I walk through the propped-open door of Motte & Bailey. 
I offer a small hello, almost a squeak, reluctant to disturb the 
quiet. I start to slowly circumnavigate the store; it seems logi-
cal, as most of the books reside along the outskirts of the store. 
The walls and shelves create small nooks while the center of 
the store remains open. I can see straight to the back. The cas-
cading towers of literature do not obstruct my line of sight.

Books are pulled from their shelves and stacked on the 

floor in an almost deliberate fashion, placed carefully next to 
an inviting chair, as if a reader had just left for tea and planned 
to come back. Some of the books are gold-plated and intricate. 
There are many cases of large, deeply colored volumes.

Along the ceiling, black, chalkboard-esque quotes line 

the walls: Some books are undeservedly forgotten; none are 
undeservedly remembered. — W.H. Auden.

I can’t agree more.
Among the sections Naval History and the Civil War, I 

search for titles I recognize but feel too young or unsophisti-
cated for this kind of market. Suddenly self-conscious, I feel 
a little foolish for even stopping to look here, as if someone 
unseen may judge me for pretending to be interested.

A man with a bulky coat — despite the sunshine and warm 

breeze — comes in and asks about two books. The man behind 
the counter seems flustered, and says he had meant to put the 
books in sleeves before the bulky-coat man came in.

“I’ll do that right now,” he says, standing.
As he got to work, the other man grabs a seat near the front 

of the store, the children’s section and loudly asks, “Do you 
know about Mary, Queen of Scots?”

“I’m looking for her, but she’s not in here,” the man contin-

ues, after a pause.

He must be flipping through a book I cannot see, and based 

on the volume they used in the otherwise silent store and the 
manner in which they addressed each other, I begin to believe 
they’ve forgotten my presence.

Unnoticed, I sit in a chair in a little nook, one of the ones 

that appeared staged or recently abandoned, and gaze at the 
collection. The spines read “Ancient Greece,” and though I 
am not exactly interested, I appreciate the breadth of what’s 
in front of me. I sit back and breathe. The two men exchange 
anecdotes about Mary, Queen of Scots, and I contemplate the 
muskiness and the clutter of the bookstore — I expect it from 
a place that sells rare and used books. It smells as though the 
books come from loving homes, placed peacefully on end 
tables of rooms with fireplaces next to pipes stuffed with 
tobacco.

A boxed trilogy of Lord of the Rings is within reach. I grab 

for it in recognition, but it is as costly as it was lovely. Feel-
ing guilty for not having bought anything, I pick up a business 
card on my way out, the smallest gesture of appreciation and 
thanks I can muster.

As I leave the men laugh loudly together, and I begin to 

wonder if the man in the coat frequently buys books from 
Motte & Bailey. Maybe the two had known each other for 
years, and I had just caught a glimpse of friendship.

I 

was walking to my 9:00 a.m. lecture on a brisk 
fall morning in Ann Arbor. However, I had 
stopped at a bench outside of South Quad and 

was unable to join the throngs of students headed 
to their classes. I couldn’t walk because I was crip-
plingly nauseated. While nausea is normal for me 
(particularly in the morning) this was far more 
intense than my normal levels. I had already blown 
through the normal remedies that get me through 
these episodes — pepto bismol and nearly a sleeve 
of saltine crackers — in an attempt to get to class 
without throwing up. 

My mind wandered to the joint in the small 

pocket of my backpack. 

Nothing else would fix my nausea enough to 

allow me to walk. I pulled the joint out of its con-
tainer and smelled the familiar, calming smell. I lit 
it and inhaled deeply, and a smile began to creep 
onto my face. I was able to put down the now near-
empty sleeve of saltines and hold my head high 
without fear of throwing up. The constant negative 
force my stomach normally exerts onto me faded 
away and I was able to get to class (on “Michigan 
Time”) with a smile on my face. 

***

In fifth grade I was diagnosed with Crohn’s dis-

ease. My symptoms started manifesting in the third 
grade, which is when my parents began having me 
tested for various diseases that cause constant nau-
sea. I was nauseated at school, while exercising, 
after eating, and a lot of times in between. After 
two MRIs and two colonoscopies, my gastroen-
terologist finally determined that it was Crohn’s, a 
disease that affects the lining of a person’s diges-
tive tract and can cause nausea, abdominal pain, 
and other symptoms.

I was given a prescription for the biggest pills I’d 

ever seen and told the disease would be with me 
for the rest of my life, but that symptoms could be 
managed through medication, diet, and exercise. 
 

Crohn’s is chronic, and manifests in each patient 
differently. Some experience flare-ups: periods 
(spanning hours to days) of intense nausea, diar-
rhea, and vomiting. My version of the disease is 
less intense, with the primary symptom being con-
stant nausea.

In high school, my disease took a turn. My intes-

tine, when stressed, began blocking food from 
passing through my colon at a point known as a 
stricture. This caused intense radiating pain to my 
back and stomach, and sent me into bouts of writh-
ing pain that could last for hours or an entire day. 
I went to the emergency room too many times in 
attempts to understand what was causing the pain. 
During the summer after my sophomore year of 
high school I had surgery to unclog three stric-
tures.

While the surgery alleviated the episodes for 

about a year, they eventually returned. This time, 
the pain was not caused by blocked food, but 
instead from stress. My gastroenterologist told me 
that my mind had associated the feeling of high 
stress with the pain that I felt during those painful 
episodes, and was now causing me to feel that pain 
when high stress occurred. The advice I received 
was to stay as stress-free as possible. Not easy, or 
realistic for a high schooler applying to college. In 
addition to the pills I took every day, I was put on 
a bi-monthly infusion, a dialysis-like procedure in 
which an anti-inflammatory drug was pumped into 
my system over several hours. My current medica-
tion was re-evaluated. But not much seemed to 
help the nausea or my stress. It was entirely up to 

me to stay healthy and pain free. 

***

Growing up in San Francisco, I saw plenty of 

drugs and alcohol. Kids in my high school grew 
facial hair as fast as they could to get fake IDs for 
parties on the weekends. Looking back, it makes 
me recall the song “Super Rich Kids” by Frank 
Ocean. However, my friends and I were never 
around these kids. We were always in other parts 
of the city, playing video games or Ultimate Fris-
bee. As such, I hadn’t ever had drugs or alcohol 
before my first semester at Michigan, living on the 
backside of Markley.

Freshmen year, as I was exposed to various 

mind-altering chemicals, I began finally under-
standing why people in San Francisco were so 
determined to get me to try marijuana because of 
my stomach. Marijuana makes my stomach dis-
appear, and makes my constant nausea dissipate, 
even if it’s only for a few hours. However, I didn’t 
start really using marijuana to help my stomach 
until the summer after freshman year.

The summer after freshman year, my dad went 

with me to get a medical marijuana card in Cali-
fornia. Above Amoeba Records in the Haight — 
San Francisco’s hippie district — sits an office that 
helps anyone (with a legitimate reason) obtain a 
medical card. The doctor (incidentally, a graduate 
of the University of Michigan Medical School) dis-
cussed my Crohn’s symptoms and told us that I was 
“the quintessential patient” for medical marijuana. 
Later that week, I purchased gummies from a dis-
pensary that had a high amount of Cannabidiol 
(CBD), the chemical in marijuana that helps abate 
migraines and other types of pain. I didn’t try them 
right away. I was nervous, because my only expe-
rience with edibles had been seeing my hall mates 
from Markley couch-stuck for hours on end.

On a trip to Boston that summer though, I des-

perately needed help. I awoke for a morning flight 
with extreme nausea. I finished packing for the 
flight, but could not even stomach a slice of toast: 
the only thing I could eat was saltines. My dad 
came up to me and told me to take one of the gum-
mies. I obliged. I had to do something. It tasted 
horrible, still cold from the fridge, and took sev-
eral minutes to choke down. And like all edibles, 
it took about forty-five minutes to kick in. I barely 
made it through the Uber ride and through airport 
security, and I continued to eat saltines and Pepto 
Bismol just to keep myself from throwing up. I was 
slouched while walking, disheveled, and clearly 
in pain. Finally, we were in line to get our tickets 
scanned to get onto the plane.

But then, in the middle of checking in, some-

thing incredible happened: I straightened my pos-
ture, looked up at my dad, and for the first time all 
day, I smiled.

“It’s working,” I said.
He smiled back at me and I started laughing; I 

couldn’t help myself. I found my seat and fell into 
a contented sleep because my stomach had finally 
disappeared.

***

Most people use marijuana to feel good and have 

fun. It’s fun for me too, but much more important-
ly, it is the most effective drug for me in my fight 
against Crohn’s. I honestly don’t know if all the 
prescription drugs I take really help prevent seri-
ous Crohn’s flare-ups. But I do know that medical 
marijuana lets me participate in any activity I want 
without fear of my stomach preventing me from 
enjoying my college experience.

I 

walked into the second floor study room 
of the School of Education ready to do 
some research for a final paper I was 

writing; I had put myself in just the right 
mindset to sit down and finish a good por-
tion of work. Surveying the area, I found the 
seat of my choice: a table to myself tucked 
away in the far corner, facing the tall, leaded 
windows that reached all the way to the high 
ceilings, allowing the crisp evening light of 
spring to shower me as I eagerly delved into 
primary sources. My thoughts were like 
a jagged slab of marble, hard, strong and 
heavy, waiting to be chiseled into a softly 
nuanced sculpture.

I settled into my spot and breathed it all 

in. I brought out my computer and opened 
Facebook.

The magic was gone. I realized this about 

five minutes into empty-heartedly scroll-
ing through my news feed; each post I saw 
acted not as the careful tap of a chisel but 
as a hammer’s blow. My thoughts were tiny 
pebbles chaotically, helplessly scattered on 
the floor.

I had had enough. For a while I had fanta-

sized about deleting my Facebook, which my 
best friend from back home, Madi, bravely 
had done during our junior year of high 
school.

“I felt like it was taking over my life,” she 

told me when I e-mailed her about writing 
this article. “I felt addicted to checking it at 
least every hour.” It hit me then, also, that I 
spent at least five minutes on social media 
every time I sit down at my computer. That’s 
over an hour every week and almost forty 
hours over a school year spent mindlessly 
scrolling through my news feed — forty 
hours of what I saw then as wasted time I 
could have spent on schoolwork or simply 
daydreaming. 

What’s more is that the moments within 

those forty hours usually made me feel pret-
ty horrible. I became extremely pessimistic: 
posts from high school friends claiming to 
have found their “people,” posts from my 
friends at Michigan who seemed to have 
found better, cooler lives than I had, and any 
other posts you could think of seemed to me 
like purposeful attempts by others to shove 
their apparent happiness in my face — me, 
who was struggling through freshman year, 
trying to push my way through the massive 
undergraduate population in an effort to 
find my niche. What was wrong with me? 
Why couldn’t I find the perfect group of 
friends who understood me completely, who 
went with me to the perfect party with other 
perfect people whose portraits complement-
ed my perfect social media profile?

It’s exhausting to relive those thoughts 

as I write them, and I’m sure they’re just 
as exhausting to read. They were certainly 
exhausting to experience; I realized during 
that moment in the School of Education how 
unnecessary it was to put myself through 
that. Facebook seemed to be the place where 
all of my anxieties manifested themselves, 
and so the only solution for me seemed to be 
to get rid of it.

I closed my computer screen and called 

my mom, with whom I’ve had countless con-

versations about the advantages and disad-
vantages of living in an age of such constant 
connectivity. I gave her a heads up that I was 
going to delete my profile — not deactivate, 
delete. As in, it would be gone forever.

So I did it. The deed was done. Five years 

of carefully curated photos, pages I’ve liked 
and groups I’ve joined gone forever, wiped 
from the record. I felt all at once liberated 
and breathless, like that feeling of getting a 
haircut and seeing too-long swaths of your 
hair lying on the ground, so impossibly 
detached from your head. Just like that, my 
Facebook, the most stylish accessory to my 
life, the force that legitimized my social rel-
evance was gone, impossibly detached like 
chopped locks of hair. Later Madi would tell 
me her experience was a similar one, that 
the decision to delete her Facebook was a 
sudden realization of what was right for her, 
and the emotion that immediately followed 
reflected this — it was one of arresting relief. 

“Deleting it wasn’t going to be the end of 

the world,” Madi told me. “Life would go on. 
And that was very empowering.” She’s right 
— not having a Facebook wasn’t a big deal as 
the excitement of life in Ann Arbor fizzled 
with everyone engulfed in final coursework. 
I had already made most of the friends I 
would that year, so Facebook wasn’t as rel-
evant to me then as it had been in the begin-
ning of freshman year.

It lacked importance in a similar way 

when I returned home to my old summer 
job for the summer, as I already knew most 
of my coworkers. Though I was working full 
time, most of my friends from home were 
gone for long periods of time, either on vaca-
tion or doing some kind of internship or 
study program. I had a lot of time to myself, 
which I filled by reading, journaling and 
exploring Columbus with our family’s old 
film camera. Not having Facebook was such 
a deliberate action that it influenced the 
way I saw my time. By purposefully omit-
ting from my life something that wasted so 
much time, I began to see each moment not 
as disposable but as a blank space character-
ized by myriad possibilities: did I want to 
fill it with wonder? Perplexity? Frustration? 
Vivacity? Serenity?

Despite 
good-hearted 
coaxing 
from 

coworkers to make a Facebook again, I fin-
ished the summer glad that I had stuck to my 
instincts and not submitted to external pres-
sures. Being Facebook-less allowed me to 
appreciate those moments in transition that 
we usually fill with social media blather. And 
even if I was “on my phone” for a moment, it 
would be reading an article on my news app 
or finding an obscure Instagram account 
(my admitted social media kryptonite).

It wasn’t until I settled back into univer-

sity life that I began to question my choice. 
I’m living in a single this semester and I’ve 
found I’ve had to be very deliberate about my 
social life. For this and other reasons, it just 
seemed like having a Facebook made sense. 
It would be practical.

One night I was feeling a similar impul-

sivity to what I felt that fateful evening in 
the School of Education. So far my new pro-
file tells me I have 262 friends.

They wrote something genius.

My nose drips. In an instant, it has gotten cold outside, 

and the winter breeze swirls yellow gingko leaves around 
in harsh circles. Inside Literati, I stare at the checkerboard 
floor, and am hyper-aware of the cadence of my sniffling in 
contrast to the smooth tunes of Norah Jones.

I scan the chalkboard headings over the shelves, each in 

their own unique font, but eventually approach a short table 
of books near the door.

One title, “Redeployment,” features the silhouette of a sol-

dier and sports one of Literati’s iconic handwritten recom-
mendations.

...this book is not a beach read, but the writing is powerful, 

the stories will stick with you, and your perspective on our 
current wars and most importantly our veterans will/may 
never be the same. Highly recommended. — Mike.

I pick it up and stuff it under my arm.
Eavesdropping, I listen to a silver-haired woman explain 

to a gentleman that the store has three floors. The main floor 
is mostly fiction, the basement is nonfiction and the upstairs 
is a coffee shop with a section for young readers. I find myself 
inexplicably nodding in agreement. The woman turns to me 
and asks if I need any help.

“I’m just looking,” I respond.
But the woman spots the book under my arm.
“Trying to decide?” she inquires. “You’ve got that look 

about you.”

She smiles the way my grandmother did, without showing 

her teeth but with her eyes bright from behind her glasses.

As I pick up a copy of a book one of my former profes-

sors had written, the three women working in the store try 
to decide if they can put the chalkboard “events” sign back 
outside.

“Is it still drizzling?” one ponders.
“No, but the wind gusts keep knocking it down,” another 

replies.

I retreat to the basement of the store and stop to see the 

latest news on Literati’s Rheinmetall typewriter, a blue-gray 
fixture perched on a low table in the corner by the stairs.

A short poem about spring is the only text on the page, 

but many snippets of text are posted on the wall behind the 
machine. Typewriter rule #6 stated, “If you type something 
genius, you’ll make it on to our wall of fame.” Beneath that, 
someone had pasted a tiny message:

something genius
I bolt back up the stairs and pay for both my selection and 

an overpriced Moleskine planner that I don’t really need.

I exit the store toting a Literati bag and head down Fourth 

Avenue.

As I fight my way through the blustery Ann Arbor after-

noon, I can hear one of the two people smoking in a huddle 
near the side of a building:

“I see those bags all the time these days.”

I want something spicy.

Incense perfumes the inside of Crazy Wisdom. I linger 

near the front of the store because there is truly so much to 
look at, and I’m distracted by the presentation of mandala 
coloring books for adults. On top of the shelves, headshots of 
spiritual teachers Meher Baba and Ram Dass, among others, 
line the wall. In the front window, up high, owl and dolphin-
shaped bells adorn a short metal tree. I don’t realize they’re 
bells until I nudge the tree and hear one jingle. Nearby, a 
book titled “Owls: Our Most Charming Bird” perches on the 
shelf. It features striking illustrations — biologically correct, 
by my estimation.

A bearded man wearing a T-shirt that reveals a sleeve tat-

too on one arm asks the young woman working at the counter 
if he can look at some jewelry. He’s interested in red garnet, 
specifically a piece with seven stones. I don’t look to see, but 
I imagine the gemstones as seven little beady eyes.

Who is he shopping for? I wonder.
Crazy Wisdom houses a multitude of stones, crystals and 

gems. I approach an impressive display of amber jewelry 
enclosed in glass. I think of my younger brother; he once 
bought a necklace here for a girl he liked, and I remember 
how the woman tenderly opened the glass case to let us grap-
ple over which one the girl would like best.

The store holds itself as a bedrock of holistic health and 

spirituality. Each artifact on display has a short description 
next to it that details its history or healing properties: The 
Hindu deity Ganesh is the god of good fortune and success. 
Black onyx supposedly protects people, transforming their 
negative energies.

I can understand why these things might be profitable.
Nearby, many non-book related objects are for sale: cards 

and hand-sewn journals, bundled sage to “protect your 
home,” incense and all of the extras for burning it, dream 
catchers, patchouli soaps and essential oils. I laugh when I 
notice a sign that reads, “Salt chunks are not to be rubbed on 
your skin.” Perhaps the people who bought salt chunks were 
yearning for something to heal them, whatever their ailment 
may be.

I draw squiggles on a Buddha board and examine quill 

pens, ink and wax stamp seals. Fancy mortar and pestles 

fill an entire display. Near the back of the store, Celtic music 
becomes audible. A blond woman asks two employees if they 
have any Tarot cards that deal with the sun sign.

“There is an astrological deck,” one of the women 

responds.

She had short brown hair and explained how she learned a 

lot about astrology from the cards.

“I like the art, too,” she added.
A grand, wood-paneled staircase leads to the Tea Room of 

Crazy Wisdom. Instead of Celtic music, horns blare through 
the speakers. At the top of the banister, there sits a collec-
tion of lavish, handmade mugs with bulbous bellies and 
stones glazed to the handles. They are colored with the most 
beautiful gem tones, and I touch many of them lightly, think-
ing about the one I once bought for my mom, even though I 
wanted to keep it for myself.

I walk up to the counter to order some tea, self-conscious 

of the way my boots sound on the hardwood floor in the 
empty room.

“What do you recommend?” I ask the woman behind the 

counter.

She has the softest black ringlets framing her face, and she 

leans across the counter to look at the tea list with me.

“What do you like?”
She rattles off with a few of her favorites, like Earl Grey or 

English Breakfast, when I interject:

“I want something spicy.”
“Spicy? Hmm … hang on.” She flips the menu to read it and 

apologizes to me.

“This is my first day of work.”
“Oh, welcome,” I say, though I immediately wonder what 

qualifies me to welcome her here.

I eye her to see if she could sense it.
I pour tea from the white pot, spilling on the table just 

slightly. After soaking it up with a tiny napkin, I take a sip. 
Bitter and earthy — not what I wanted, but it’s warm, and I 
feel grateful nonetheless.
