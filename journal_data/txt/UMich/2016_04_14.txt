The Atlanta rap trio 
dabs their way to a

It’s Wednesday night at Hill 

Auditorium, 
and 
Michigan 

football coach Jim Harbaugh is 

dabbing onstage.

As the ultimate event of Music 

Matters’ SpringFest, the Atlanta 
rap group Migos took the stage 
around 9:30. After a few hours 
of prep by their hype-man, the 
audience was clearly ready. The 
group, consisting of Quavo, Offset, 
and Takeoff, immediately began 
rolling adlib-rap and tossing verbal 
alley-oops to each other. Migos are 
pioneers of that type of repetitive, 
consistent rap style, now pervasive 
among Atlanta’s freshman class.

Best of Ann Arbor

Golden Apple 

recipient Ryan Ball 
links accounting, 

improv and Denmark

By RACHEL COHEN

Daily Staff Reporter

On 
Wednesday 
night 
in 

Rackham 
Auditorium, 
nearly 

200 students and faculty heard 
Ryan Ball, assistant professor of 
accounting at the Ross School of 
Business, talk Denmark, mixed 
martial arts and improv comedy 
in his ideal “last lecture” as the 
26th Recipient of the Golden 
Apple 
Award. 
Many 
in 
the 

audience were former students, 
some of whom nominated him for 
the award.

The Golden Apple Award is the 

only teaching award on campus 
chosen by students honoring 
excellent professors whom they 
believe have left an impact.

In the event’s introduction, 

Golden Apple Co-Chair Erica 
Mindel, an LSA senior, said the 

award honors teachers who treat 
each lecture with the event’s idea 
in mind.

“The Golden Apple Award 

honors 
those 
teachers 
who 

consistently treat each lecture as if 
it were their last chance to impart 
knowledge on their students, 
who engage each student to think 
critically and inspire discourse 
outside of the classroom, and who 
do so enthusiastically,” Mindel 
said.

She added that the Golden 

Apple Award was inspired by the 
teachings of Rabbi Eliezer ben 
Hyrcanous, who instructed his 
students to “get your lives in order 
one day before you die.”

Ball discovered he was the 2016 

recipient last month after some of 
his students asked him to lunch 
and instead escorted him to a 
courtyard in the Business School 
filled with his colleagues and 
students. He received a record-
breaking 150 nominations from 
the graduate students he has 
taught.

for Ambiguity: Lessons from

Experts charge 

that seizure policy 

largely used by 
police for profit 

By KEVIN BIGLIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Panelists 
discussed 
civil 

asset 
forfeiture 
in 
a 
talk 

Wednesday afternoon at the 
Law School citing multiple 
shortfalls and concerns with 
the policy.

The talk was presented by 

The Federalist Society and 
Law Students for Sensible Drug 
Policy, and moderated by Law 
Prof. Adam Pritchard.

Civil 
asset 
forfeiture 
is 

a legal tool that allows law 
enforcement officials to seize 
property they believe has been 
involved in certain types of 
criminal activity.

The panelists included Ted 

Nelson, a retired Michigan 
state police officer; Julie Beck, 
an 
assistant 
U.S. 
attorney 

who also serves as chief of 

the Federal Forfeiture and 
Financial Litigation Unit in 
Detroit and Clark Neily, senior 
attorney at the Institute for 
Justice.

The panelists outlined how 

civil asset forfeiture happens, 
from the initial forfeiture by 
police to the process through 
the court system to relief 
available after the forfeiture 
has been consummated.

Neily said civil forfeiture 

is currently a system of zero 
accountability, noting that in 
civil cases, unlike criminal 
cases, there is no investigation 
to accuse someone of engaging 
in illegal activity. Rather, law 
enforcement can use probable 
cause to seize property on sight. 
Because of this, Neil said police 
often abuse civil forfeiture by 
taking more from their suspect 
than necessary.

That topic of abuse of 

forfeiture — and more broadly, 
whether 
law 
enforcement 

values profits over innocence, 
Nelson said civil forfeiture 
cases are tied to the war on 
drugs.

DESIREE CHEW

Daily Staff Reporters

Students gathered on the Diag 

and around campus Wednesday to 
celebrate a year’s worth of efforts 

in community service, discuss 
entrepreneurship initiatives and 
encourage one another through 
art and music at SpringFest. The 
annual event, sponsored by the 
organization 
MUSIC 
Matters, 

took place on the Diag as well as 
North University Avenue between 
Thayer and Fletcher streets.

Along with innovation and 

philanthropic efforts, the festival 
also focused on new sustainability 
initiatives in an effort to introduce 
environmentally 
friendly 

programs to the event and campus 

as a whole.

LSA junior Matt Fisher, vice 

president of MUSIC Matters, said 
the group organizes the event to 
encourage a unified student body.

“We try to bring together 

different student organizations, 
get them to work together, to 
collaborate with each other, and 
to give students an opportunity 
to meet one another and extend 
beyond the communities that they 
typically interact with,” Fisher 
said.

Affordable housing 

and cleanup of

issues at event

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

In a debate hosted by students 

at the Ford School of Public Policy 
Wednesday, eight candidates for 
August’s Ann Arbor City Council 
primary 
elections 
discussed 

their positions on city issues such 
as affordable housing and the 
cleanup of a contaminated plume 
of groundwater in Ann Arbor.

Four 
incumbents 
seeking 

re-election — Kirk Westphal (D–
Ward 2), Julie Grand (D–Ward 3), 
Graydon Krapohl (D–Ward 4) and 
Chuck Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) — 
participated in the debate, held in 
the Annenberg Auditorium. Sumi 
Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) — the 
fifth also seeking re-election — 
was absent.

Only 
Kailasapathy 
and 

Krapohl are currently contested 
in 
the 
Democratic 
primary

Greek life philanthropy 

efforts were included as a part of 
MUSIC Matters’ SpringFest on 
Wednesday for the first time in 
the five-year history of the event.

During the day, fraternities 

and sororities had the opportunity 
to set up a table for one hour each 
on North University Avenue to 
support an organization and cause 
of their choosing.

According to MUSIC Matters, 

the Alpha Phi, Sigma Kappa, 
Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Chi 
Omega, Chi Omega, Gamma Phi 

Beta, Delta Gamma and Zeta Tau 
Alpha sororities all participated.

LSA sophomore Lacey 

Mendelson, Alpha Phi sorority 
campus affairs vice president, 
said their main goal of the day 
was to raise money for women’s 
heart health, with proceeds going 
toward the Alpha Phi Foundation.

“Women’s heart health is our 

main thing and we send money 
to women and their families 
who have been affected by it,” 
Mendelson said. 

The Sigma Kappa sorority 

dedicated their efforts to an 
environmental organization called 
Inherit the Earth. LSA sophomore 
Becca Berman, Sigma Kappa 
vice president of philanthropic 
services, said their goal was not 
to raise money, but rather to 
increase environmental awareness 
by encouraging people to plant 
violets and take them home.

“I decided to push towards 

Inherit the Earth because 
it’s one of the lesser known 
philanthropies, and I thought 
people should know about it,” 
Berman said.

Minority experience 

on campus 

emphasized by 

SpringFest display

By RHEA CHEETI

For the Daily

On 
Wednesday 
during 
the 

University of Michigan’s annual 
SpringFest celebration, students 
watched as large, white screens 
were assembled piece by piece 
into a maze on the Diag.

Known as the “Identity Maze,” 

the project showcased artwork 
and positive messages on 30 
translucent panels. The initiative 
was formed and executed by LSA 
junior Misba Saleem, Engineering 
senior Kyle Faulkner, LSA senior 
Arnold Reed, LSA senior Areeba 
Jibril and Engineering senior 
Robert Greenfield as part of 
collaboration between Blaclist and 
the Muslim Students’ Association.

Saleem, 
vice 
president 
of 

external affairs for the MSA, said 
she thinks the exhibit positively 
affected students on campus by 
broadening perspectives on the 
experiences of minority students.

“The Identity Maze is supposed 

to represent the diverted path 
that minorities have to take on 
campus — it’s not that they can’t 
get where they’re going, but 
there are obstacles,” Saleem said. 
“The maze itself is supposed to 
be symbolic of that path, as well 
as the artwork that we’re going 
to have inside, which is going to 
be from Muslim students, Black 
students and Latino students.”

The art included pieces created 

by University students, as well 
as pictures of cultural exhibits 
and influential protests. Phrases 
like “Muslim women are NOT 
oppressed 
… 
Muslim 
women 

are empowered” and “Are you 
non-racist or anti-racist?” lined 
the walls, accompanying other 
sentiments about race and identity 
in society.

Jibril, 
who 
supervised 
the 

selection of the pieces, said the 

pieces included represented a 
diverse array of individuals and 
events.

“Inside the maze we wanted 

artwork that would reflect those 
individual narratives. So we have 
art pieces from protests … and also 
ones showing peoples’ cultures 
and different cultural shows,” 
Jibril said. “I think it’s crazy that 
we actually managed to pull this 
off — five of us built 30 sections 
of wall, and we didn’t really have 
any experience with anything like 
this before.”

LSA freshman Tiana Huang 

said that she thought the Identity 
Maze brought up complex social 
issues on campus and displayed 
both negative and positive effects 
of free speech.

“I think it’s important to learn 

about all the other aspects on 
campus that you might not delve 
into, just on a daily basis,” Huang 
said. “We don’t really think about 
these issues that are prevalent on 
campus as much as we should.”

LSA freshman Victoria Thach 

also said she thought the project 

was highlighting issues on campus, 
adding that it brought up different 
perspectives on those issues.

“It’s a nice reminder that not 

everyone feels the same way about 
issues … people don’t realize that 
these things are happening right 
now,” Thach said.

Saleem noted that she sees 

this installation having a positive 
impact particularly in light of 
recent anti-Islam chalk messages 
on the Diag. The maze showcased 
several images of events featuring 
Muslim 
students 
throughout 

the year, such as the Malaysian 
Culture Night hosted by the 
Malaysian Student Association. 
Slogans promoting solidarity with 
Muslim students on campus were 
also featured in the maze.

“I think it’s really important for 

students to be represented in such 
a central part of campus,” Saleem 
said. “This is just my personal 
opinion, but given everything that 
happened with the chalkings, 
this is a great way to reclaim 
the Diag, and in a sense it’s very 
empowering.”

he said, asset forfeiture was 
intended as a tool to combat drug 
distribution. However, he said he 
has seen the law being used by 
law enforcement for profit, rather 
than for dealing with drug use.

“The war on drugs, which 

started back when my career 
started, 
has 
not 
been 
very 

effective,” Nelson said. “As a 
matter of fact, we are spending a 
lot of money in an area that is not 
having the effect that we thought 
it would have on drug use in this 
country. It is my belief that the 
war on drugs has been a failure. 
The targeting of drug people 
had more to do with assets 
than it had to do with the drugs 
themselves.”

Nelson also noted that in 2011 

the Michigan legislature changed 
the way asset forfeiture was 
allocated — instead of the seized 
funds going into a general fund 
to combat narcotics, local police 
forces are able to use the funds as 
they wish. He charged that this 
has led to the promotion of asset 
forfeiture.

“I think that opened up the 

floodgates for revenue,” Nelson 
said. “And I think that opened 
up the floodgates for policing for 
profit.”

In a forfeiture report released 

by the Michigan State Police, in 
2014 alone $24 million in items 
was seized by law enforcement 
in the state of Michigan. Nelson 
added that eighty-six percent of 
seizures in Michigan go without 
judicial review or any court 
proceedings, which he said allow 
police 
enforcement 
to 
avoid 

justifying why they investigated 
the victim and took their assets.

Focusing 
her 
remarks 
on 

Federal policy discussing the 
Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform 
Act enacted by Congress in 
2000, which Beck said it was in 
response to state abuse of civil 
and criminal forfeiture seizures 
that act in a system with no prior 
restrictions. The act, among other 
reforms, 
required 
government 

bodies obtain a warrant based 
on probable cause before seizing 
property.

One particular problem, she 

noted, is that nationally 80 percent 
of seizures result in administrative 
forfeitures and go without claims 
challenging 
the 
forfeiture. 

Claims are normally not made, 

even when the person who had 
their assets seized was notified. 
Beck said the lack of claims stem 
from a number of factors, such 
as because it is too difficult to 
understand the notice, since the 
person often does not have money 
for a lawyer or because the person 
cannot claim their assets because 
it could put them under criminal 
investigation.

Neily echoed Beck’s sentiments, 

stressing 
the 
complications 

surrounding asset forfeiture law. 
He said there are also few claims 
made because lawyers do not have 
enough training to take on such 
cases and win.

Speaking to efforts to combat 

possible corruption used with 
civil asset forfeiture, panelists 
emphasized the need for discretion 
among those supervising cases, as 
well as restriction of when it can 
be used. Beck said though cases 
exist where seizures go without 
issue, more oversight must be used 
in cases where it is not as clear 
what crimes were committed by 
people in roles like hers.

“These are law enforcement 

tools that can seem very heavy 
handed,” Beck said. “They should 
be used responsibly. And if they 
are not used responsibly, then the 

assets should go back.”

Neily, who has worked on 

asset forfeiture for five years, 
called it the worst public policy 
he has ever encountered because 
it unjustly targets minorities 
who do not always have the 
means to make claims and fight 
back against law enforcement 
that seizes their assets.

“I don’t think you could design 

a worse public policy,” Neily 
said. “It routinely victimizes 
innocent people who, generally 
speaking, are minorities and of 
lower socioeconomic status.”

Reiterating that civil asset 

forfeiture is now used primarily 
for profit rather than combating 
drug and narcotic use, Neily said 
he thinks the policy should be 
ended entirely, and, until that 
happens, it should continually 
be restricted so that fraudulent 
activity is avoided.

“Most people have no idea 

what civil forfeiture is,” Neily 
said. “But when it’s explained 
to them, 90 percent of people 
say that shouldn’t be a policy. 
So I think we’re moving in that 
direction.”

PANEL
From Page 1

Denmark, MMA & Improv,” 
involved 
anecdotes 
about 

preparing for the ambiguity in 
both accounting and in life.

Ball 
said 
he 
thinks 
of 

accounting as a science of 
measurement, which helps those 
who do not know what’s going 
on around them discern their 
surroundings.

“Measurement is repeatedly 

like stumbling around in a dark 
room until you have some idea of 
where the furniture is in there,” 
he said. “But the darkness is 
something that never goes away 
and it’s something that all of us 
have to grapple with.”

Ball said his job is to help 

students 
prepare 
for 
this 

darkness 
of 
ambiguity 
and 

uncertainty 
that 
accounting 

cannot measure. In turn, he 
said his lecture would tell 
three stories that show how he 
approaches ambiguity today.

His first story featured a 

Danish 
friend 
and 
former 

colleague at the University of 
Chicago, 
Hans 
Christensen, 

who would constantly complain 
about Denmark.

Ball said one day another 

former 
colleague, 
Eugene 

Fama, who won the Nobel Prize 
of Economics in 2013, asked 
Christensen how he could be so 
pessimistic about Denmark when 
it was rated the happiest country 
on earth by the World Health 
Organization. 
Christensen 

replied that because Danes have 
zero 
expectations, 
they 
are 

always pleasantly surprised.

Ball said, in the face of 

ambiguity, it is better to set 
expectations 
appropriately 

instead of having none.

“Oftentimes our happiness is 

tied to how surprised pleasantly 
or not pleasantly we are, and 
how surprised we are by things 
depends on two different things,” 
Ball said. “One is the actual 
outcome, the future outcome 
that oftentimes is way out of our 
control. But the other thing that 
it depends on is our expectations, 
how we set those expectations, 
and that is something that’s 
within your control.”

His second story centered 

around expecting change in 

the face of ambiguity. He cited 
the 
first 
Ultimate 
Fighting 

Championship in 1993 when 
Royce Gracie, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu 
practitioner, unexpectedly won 
against all of his opponents, who 
all fought with different styles.

He said Gracie took advantage 

of his opponents’ inability to 
adapt, meaning they were too 
bound by the conventions of their 
particular styles. He used this 
metaphor as an example of how 
to cope with the different arenas 
in which audience members find 
themselves.

“You are going to find yourself 

in ambiguous arenas that you’ve 
never been in,” Ball said. “This 
is a metaphor for globalizing 
economy. What works well in the 
U.S. may not necessarily work 
as well as a strategy when you 
find yourself competing against 
a Chinese competitor … how are 
you going to adapt?”

He finished the story with 

an anecdote about when Matt 
Hughes 
unexpectedly 
beat 

the now-Hall of Famer Gracie 
in the UFC 60 match. He said 
Gracie had only used his jiu-jitsu 
skills while Hughes used mixed 
martial arts, a combination of 
various fighting styles. As the 
standards of fighting changed, 
Gracie forgot to adapt.

Ball said he hoped Gracie’s 

story reminds the audience to 
constantly adapt to the changing 
world.

“When you get out of school 

and 
leave 
this 
university, 

make sure that you make the 
investment back in the most 
important asset of all: yourself,” 
he said. “Don’t stop learning even 
though your formal education 
may be done; strive to invest by 
continuously learning.”

In 
his 
final 
story, 
Ball 

discussed his first performance 
for an improv comedy class 
he took in 2006. In improv, 
the performers do not know 
what they will be performing, 
which Ball said is the ultimate 
ambiguous situation. Originally 
terrified of public speaking, Ball 
said he stumbled upon an improv 
comedy class and decided to sign 
up, unaware of the mandatory 
performances at the end of the 
class.

He said he worried about what 

he would be asked to do during 
his first performance, but once 

he started he realized there was 
nothing he could do about it but 
try to enjoy himself.

Now, he said he suggests 

students take an improv class 
because it is the best tool for 
getting used to ambiguity.

At the end of his lecture, Ball 

thanked all of his teachers who 
have impacted him to teach so 
passionately.

Patrick Craves, a second-year 

MBA student at the Business 
School, 
said 
he 
nominated 

Ball because he was the most 
energetic professor he has had 
at the University of Michigan, 
adding that Wednesday’s lecture 
attested to his teaching styles.

“His presentation today was 

very Ryan Ball,” Craves said. 
“I mean, he related Denmark, 
UFC fighting and improv back 
to what he always teaches us, 
and that’s the ambiguity of 
accounting and how that makes 
it frustrating and beautiful at 
the same time.”

Another former student of 

Ball’s, Rafael Frankel, a first-year 
MBA student, said he was also 
impressed with how Ball related 
seemingly random topics back to 
accounting.

“(Ball) 
was 
giving 
some 

real examples of some things 
that are not related at all with 
accounting, but by the end he 
kind of showed some of the 
relations with accounting and 
the business world and how you 
should take those examples and 
take some practical things for 
your life,” Frankel said. “I was 
really impressed on the example 
he gave about MMA, which I am 
really passionate about, being 
Brazilian and knowing Brazilian 
Jiu-Jitsu … but I never related it 
to accounting.”

In an interview after his 

lecture, Ball said he was thankful 
for his students who came to the 
event and put in the effort to 
nominate him.

“The fact that all of those 

students who normally don’t 
leave the Ross Business School 
would come over here to help 
honor me this way and to come 
out of the woodwork and vote 
like that, even reading the 
comments that they published 
in the fliers were absolutely 
amazing,” Ball said. “And I 
am just so appreciative of the 
feedback I get.”

Fisher added that the success of 

the newly introduced sustainability 
initiatives came from a push to 
continue the group’s previous 
collaboration with other groups on 
campus.

Many 
Greek 
life 
groups 

participated as student volunteers 
in the sustainability drive, such as 
the sorority Sigma Kappa, which 
set up a table to distribute 200 free 
flowerpots and flower seeds. LSA 
sophomore Becca Berman said 
the initiative was in concert with 
Inherit the Earth, Sigma Kappa’s 
environmental program.

“One 
of 
our 
national 

philanthropies 
is 
Inherit 
the 

Earth,” Burman said. “Today at 
SpringFest, we decided to sponsor 
them by providing flowerpots and 

flowers for people to take home 
with them.”

LSA junior Elizabeth Morand, 

senior producer of SpringFest, 
spearheaded 
the 
zero-waste 

portion of the event this year — a 
program intended to eliminate 
trash, 
encourage 
compostable 

products and create sustainable 
initiatives.

“We’re 
really 
focused 
on 

promoting positive social change,” 
Morand said. “It only made 
sense for us to also be concerned 
about climate change and the 
environment; it’s just incorporated 
between the whole idea of social 
changes.”

Morand said she hopes to 

expand the event and its different 
components 
— 
especially 

sustainability — in the future. 
Ideally, Morand said she would 
like to see the entire SpringFest day 
become zero-waste.

SonReal, one of the performers 

at the daytime event, said in an 
interview he enjoyed his first visit 
to the University of Michigan, and 
thought the event was important at 
a college campus.

“It brings a lot of the students 

together, and I also think it brings 
the students together in a way that 
they don’t get a chance to actually 
do very often, which is bringing 
them together through art, music,” 
he said. “That’s the best way to 
get to know people and be out and 
about and enjoy your time as a 
student.”

SpringFest also featured a row of 

sustainability-driven food trucks 
parked 
outside 
the 
Michigan 

League. This included Shimmy 
Shack — owned by Engineering 
lecturer Debra Levantrosser — 
Michigan’s first and only vegan and 
gluten-free food truck.

The Ann Arbor staple attracted 

crowds of student by selling finger 
foods like nachos, fries, hummus 
and pita, as well as a variety of 
flavored shakes.

Levantrosser, who has had 

Shimmy Shack for three years, said 
it has always had an environmental 
focus.

“We 
used 
100 
percent 

biodegradable and compostable 
materials 
for 
today’s 
event. 

Also, we are vegan, which is 
environmentally conscious in and 
of itself, in terms of what veganism 
does for the environment,” she 
said.

Levantrosser 
added 
that 
it 

was more than sustainable food 
practices that made her business 
renewable, pointing to the back of 
the truck.

for their seats. No Republicans 
or independents are currently 
running for Council. Kailasapathy 
is being challenged for her Ward 
1 seat by both longtime volunteer 
coordinator Jason Frenzel and 
local 
entrepreneur 
Will 
Leaf. 

Krapohl 
is 
running 
against 

Diane Giannola, manager of the 
University of Michigan’s startup 
company, Venture Accelerator, and 
local attorney Eric Lipson.

All eight candidates stressed 

affordable housing policies as one 
of the city’s leading issues, though 
most diverged on how to best 
remedy the issue.

Lipson said rising rent rates 

threaten to gentrify Ann Arbor and 
drive out lower-income residents. 
However, he also acknowledged 
city policies on the issue must be 
balanced.

“We don’t want Ann Arbor to 

become an enclave for the rich,” 
Lipson said. “At the same time, we 
don’t want to destroy the values 
that have made Ann Arbor such a 
great place to live.”

Frenzel and Giannola proposed 

encouraging 
low-rent 
housing 

and accessory housing — small 
housing units built on existing 
lots — near downtown. However, 
Leaf dismissed accessory units as 
a “token solution” and asserted 
the only systemic solution is 
with reforming the city’s zoning 
protocol to open more land for 
residential development, which 
Lipson echoed.

“City Council’s challenge is to 

allow the supply of land to increase 
in a way that’s acceptable to local 
residents,” Leaf said, suggesting the 
city allow for mixed commercial 
and residential zoning instead of 
allotting areas only for commercial 
or residential use. “We can allow 
more people to move into those 
commercial corridors and have it 
be more mixed-use.”

Warpehoski also supported a 

mixed-use zoning proposal, but 
said it isn’t a sufficient remedy 
to rising rents. Rather, he said 
subsidized housing is necessary to 
create truly affordable housing for 
low-income residents.

“We 
also 
need 
a 
housing 

solution that addresses very low-
income households as well, and 
that’s a situation where we can’t 
solve that problem without some 
form of subsidy,” Warpehoski 
said, acknowledging new revenue 
sources — such as the sale of a 

vacant library lot — would be 
needed to fund a subsidy.

“I think Ann Arbor’s a wealthy 

enough 
and 
inclusive 
enough 

community where we should be 
able to do that,” he added.

The issue of the chemical plume 

— a slow-moving contaminated 
with a carcinogenic chemical 
mass of groundwater beneath Scio 
Township and Ann Arbor that is 
moving toward the Huron River — 
was also raised during the debate, 
with candidates disagreeing over 
whether to petition for federal 
intervention and cleanup.

Citing a lack of faith in the 

state’s ability to manage the 
contamination, 
Ann 
Arbor 

Township, which is a separate 
municipality from the city of 
Ann Arbor, recently authorized 
a petition for the Environmental 
Protection Agency to designate 
the plume to a superfund site for 
cleanup. Ann Arbor city officials 
have said they are concerned this 
may hurt local property values but 
have not yet ruled out supporting 
the petition.

Warpehoski said though he 

believes the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality has 
failed to contain the plume for 
the past two decades, he would 
prefer to work with the Michigan 

Attorney General’s office to litigate 
Gelman Sciences — the original 
polluter — for a more stringent 
cleanup 
using 
new 
standards 

from the DEQ, though he did not 
rule out supporting an eventual 
EPA petition. Leaf took a similar 
position on the EPA position.

“We have seen so little action 

by the state courts and the state 
Department of Environmental 
Quality to really do what it’s 
going to take to address that 
long-term threat,” Warpehoski 
said. 
“I 
think 
superfund 

designation is something we 
need to have on the table … but 
we absolutely need to continue 
fighting, whether it’s through 
the courts or the MDEQ.”

Frenzel 
also 
criticized 
the 

state’s efforts in managing the 
contaminated groundwater, but 
said he would never support a 
federal 
intervention, 
instead 

suggesting local residents should 
pressure state officials to take 
stronger action.

“I’m really concerned about 

superfund designation and its 
implications 
socially 
for 
our 

community,” Frenzel said. “It is not 
to say that I don’t find the DEQ’s 
actions to be pretty reprehensible 
at this point.”

into the crowd. The trio also 
brought 
Michigan 
football 

coach Jim Harbaugh, as well 
as members of the Michigan 
football team onto the stage, 
who all dabbed while Migos 
perform their hit single “Look 
at my Dab.”

In an interview with the 

Daily after the concert, Quavo 
said the group has a deep 
respect for the University of 
Michigan, 
and 
appreciates 

always 
being 
welcome 
to 

campus with open arms.

The group previously took 

the stage with Harbaugh at the 
“Signing of the Stars” event in 
March where they also dabbed 
with former Detroit Tigers 
manager Jim Leyland.

“Y’all have supported us 

since day one,” Quavo said. 
“I just like the way you all 
construct things, and your 
whole program, I respect it a 
lot. We’re loyal people, so if 
you rock with us, we’ll rock 
with y’all.”

Hosted by MUSIC Matters, 

the 
group’s 
performance 

came after a day-long series 
of activities for SpringFest, 
stretching 
from 
the 
Diag 

to 
North 
University. 
In 

collaboration 
with 
several 

other organizations at the 
University, SpringFest featured 
interactive booths, a fashion 
show, live performances and 
other activities.

Business 
junior 
Kaitlin 

Smith, 
who 
attended 
the 

concert, 
said 
she 
thought 

SpringFest was an overall a 
success.

“I think it went really well 

this year,” she said. “Everyone 
who participated this year was 
really really phenomenal.”

As a part of MUSIC Matters’ 

mission, proceeds from the 
Migos’ performance will be 
used toward a Detroit summer 
youth camp set to launch this 
summer. During the camp, 
which will be hosted at the 
University, Detroit high school 
students will participate in 

workshops, 
class 
sessions 

and other activities aimed 
at inspiring participants to 
pursue higher education in the 
future.

Takeoff 
told 
the 
Daily 

he thought giving back to 
the 
community 
was 
very 

important in inspiring more 
hope in at-risk communities.

“It’s positive to give back to 

the community with the things 
that are going on, and to let 
them know that there is still 
hope,” he said.

In addition to planning the 

summer youth camp, MUSIC 
Matters 
also 
bussed 
150 

Detroit high school students 
to the University Wednesday 
so they could participate in the 
day’s events.

Smith 
said 
she 
thinks 

interacting 
with 
Detroit 

students 
furthers 
MUSIC 

Matters’ mission, and gives 
their 
organization 
the 

opportunity to learn about 
different communities.

“When we interact with 

these 
schools 
in 
Detroit, 

it not only kind of helps 
in 
communicating 
the 

importance of education to 
them, but it also teaches us 
about the people that live very 
close to us and people that live 
different lifestyles,” she said.

Overall, 
students 
in 

attendance 
said 
they 

appreciated Migos’ enthusiasm 
throughout the performance 
and 
their 
continuous 

interactions with the crowd. 
In an interview after the show, 
LSA junior Drew Merrill said 
he thought the group brought 
high energy to the stage. 

“It 
exceeded 
my 

expectations,” he said. “I wish 
they stuck around a little while 
longer.”

LSA junior Eman Jacksi said 

she thought the concert was 
a nice break from the stress 
of finals, which members of 
Migos mentioned during their 
performance. 

“It was awesome,” Jacksi 

said. “It was definitely a good 
break from writing papers and 
a great time.”

n Detroit, 195 public schools have 
been closed since 2000. But the 
mass 
liquidation 
of 
neighborhood 

schools is not unique 
to 
Detroit. 
Several 

urban 
communities 

are restructuring their 
public education systems 
to 
suit 
the 
needs 
of 

changing demographics. 
The rapid pace of school 
closures raises questions 
about 
its 
impacts 
on 

neighborhoods and their 
residents. 
Research 

suggests 
that 
closing 

neighborhood 
schools 

increases the likelihood that neighborhoods 
around them will deteriorate. In conjunction 
with challenging neighborhood conditions, 
poorly 
performing 
schools 
accelerate 

neighborhood 
decline 
by 
hindering 

the 
preservation 
of 
stable 
residential 

communities. With a loss of a community 
anchor, school employees are displaced, 
property values decrease and businesses 
lack incentives to develop in neighborhoods. 
 

Detroit has a number of vacant school 

buildings 
scattered 
around 
the 
city. 

According to a 2015 report by a public data 
company called Loveland, “Out of the 195 
schools that closed between 2000 and 2015, 
81 of the buildings are currently vacant 
and unused.” Vacant school buildings can 
be locations for crime, 
such 
as 
scrapping 
or 

drug dealing. As large 
architectural 
structures 

dilapidate, their presences 
subtract from the aesthetic 
of 
a 
neighborhood. 

Instead of closing these 
structures, Detroit Public 
Schools should consider 
repurposing 
school 

buildings 
to 
develop 

mixed-income 
housing 

or maintain operations of 
the school, and increase 
their usage as community-
centered buildings.

Instead 
of 
spending 

exorbitant 
amounts 
of 

money 
on 
demolishing 

architecturally 
sound 

school buildings, the city can encourage 
new and mixed-purpose buildings. Some 
closed schools have been redeveloped into 
residential 
apartments, 
movie 
theaters 

and churches. The city should encourage 
housing developers to create mixed-income 
housing structures within vacant school 
buildings. Mixed-income housing increases 
benefits and resources within schools and 
ultimately improves student achievement. 
Neighborhoods with mixed-housing prices 
are three times more likely to have highly 
rated schools than affordable neighborhoods.

Mixed-income housing, however, can 

be used as a veil for gentrification, and 
only serve the poor who are “most likely 
to succeed.” Detroit City Council should 
invent specific protections, such as low-
interest mortgages and down payment 
assistance for specific income brackets, 
in housing developments that surround 
neighborhood schools.

“Education policy is constrained by 

housing policy,” claims Richard Rothstein, 
a research associate at the Economic Policy 
Institute. “It is not possible to desegregate 
schools without desegregating both low-
income 
and 
affluent 
neighborhoods.” 

Schools are influential institutions in 
determining where people live.

A 2015 study administered by the 

National Association of Realtors Home 
Buyer and Seller Generational Trends 
found the quality of the school district was 
the sixth-most-important factor affecting 
neighborhood 
choice 
for 
homebuyers. 

Researchers found a direct correlation 
between school quality and home values: 
Schools receive a substantial portion of 
their funding from local property taxes, 
thus, highly valued homes are critical to 
supplementing school funding.

The disparities between Detroit’s and its 

suburban counterparts’ home values is stark 
— the average home value in Bloomfield Hills 
is an estimated $400,000; in Detroit, the 
average home value is just under $40,000. 
“As a result, Detroit must levy a property 
tax 10 times higher than Bloomfield Hills to 
raise the same amount, per home, for a school 
maintenance or improvement project,” MLive 
reported. As Detroit resurges from financial 
troubles, city leaders must make it a priority 
to conjointly create quality schools and build 
solid districts to attract more residents to 
populate the neighborhoods.

Schools 
are 
prominent 
community 

anchors, and when their facilities are 
accessible to the surrounding community, 
their public utility and value increases. 
Twenty-one DPS schools have been named 
12/7 Community Schools, which are schools 
open beyond the traditional school day 
hours to offer services such as child/elder 
care, job skills training, financial literacy 
training, food distribution and medical care. 
Facilities that accommodate community 
members and expand opportunities for 
students provide a positive impact on the 
neighborhood as a whole. For example, 
Priest 
Elementary-Middle 
School 
is 

a 12/7 community school that hosts a 
Parent Resource Center: a community 
gathering space with computers, phones, 
small libraries, play areas for children, 
workshops, GEP support, book support, 
college information, etc.

Homeowners 
would 

value 
amenities 
schools 

can 
provide, 
such 
as 

community 
spaces, 

libraries, swimming pools 
and 
playgrounds. 
Open 

school buildings facilitate 
democracy 
because 

community members can 
decide the best uses for 
the 
buildings. 
Schools 

can provide a sense of 
community 
ownership 

and 
can 
encourage 

community 
members 
to 

be more invested in the 
quality of the educational 
activities 
for 
students. 

With authentic parent and 
community engagement in 
school facilities, there is 

an equal stake in ensuring school facilities 
are maintained and accessible to the public. 
12/7 community schools are examples of 
a best practices approach that enhances 
school value to the neighborhood.

Revitalizing Detroit’s landscapes will 

require a commitment to providing quality 
education and living conditions for students 
and their families across the city. Detroit’s 
past economic, political and social history 
has made meaningful development difficult. 
Racial tensions, population declines and 
restrained budgets have challenged the 
city to transform its school system and its 
operations, and envision a new city design. 
With new leadership and restored power to 
residents, Detroit neighborhoods and the 
public school system have the potential to 
revive Detroit’s urban vibrancy.

Urban 
planning 
and 
educational 

policy leaders can and should work in 
tandem with each other to streamline 
neighborhood revitalization. Community-
based education models can enhance 
student 
achievement 
and 
improve 

neighborhood 
conditions. 
Preserving 

Detroit’s neighborhood schools ensures 
their presence as valuable community 
establishments for all members.

A 
school-centered 
community 

revitalization effort depends on safe and 
affordable housing that is attractive to 
families with children, retains current 
families and improves the academic quality 
of neighborhood schools to sustain Detroit’s 
renewal. A close partnership between 
school leadership and city planners can 
create school-centered communities across 
the city that will transform the quality of 
our urban schools and communities.

Facilities that 
accommodate 
community 
members 

and expand 

opportunities for 
students provide a 
positive impact on 
the neighborhood as 

a whole. 

Every Thursday morning, I 

walk into Weill Hall, climb three 
flights of stairs, open the door to 
a boardroom overlooking State 
Street and am transformed from 
a 
fourth-year 
college 
student 

into a member of a philanthropic 
foundation 
tasked 
with 

distributing $50,000.

Endowed 
with 
a 
grant 

from 
The 
Philanthropy 
Lab, 

a 
foundation 
dedicated 
to 

charitable 
education, 
Public 

Policy 
475: 
Philanthropic 

Foundations (the section taught 
by 
Megan 
Tompkins-Stange) 

explores what it means to give 
away money. My 14 classmates 
and 
I 
dissect 
standards 
for 

giving, 
who 
is 
“worthy” 
of 

philanthropic funding and how 
we see ourselves giving in the 
future. 
Across 
the 
country, 

there are 13 other universities 
exploring these same themes, all 
to the tune of a very real $50,000 
to be given away at the conclusion 
of the semester.

I am a senior now, and I am 

planning 
on 
working 
in 
the 

nonprofit sector, so this course 
aligns perfectly with my own 
career aspirations. However, it 
flips the script on my ambitions — 
I anticipate I will be spending the 
next few years of my life raising 
money, rather than giving it away. 
I have come to the conclusion that 
it’s a lot more fun to be giving 
away money for a cause than 
asking for money for a cause. As a 
donor (rather than a fundraiser), 
I feel immensely powerful. I have 
$50,000 burning a hole in my 
pocket, and it’s my decision who 
gets to take home a slice of the pie.

Every Thursday morning, I 

walk into this class and I feel 
powerful and important. This 
class has more gravitas than 
any other that I have taken 
here, with real money and the 
potential for substantive social 

change on the line.

But how should philanthropy 

operate? 
Metaphorically 

speaking, 
altruism 
gives 
me 

glowing, clear skin. Naturally, 
helping others makes me feel good 
about myself. Yet, acknowledging 
those benefits I gain from giving 
away money makes me squeamish. 
The social expectation is that we 
help others without any selfish 
motivations. Truthfully, I give 
away money for selfish reasons 
all the time. I pull out a few coins 
out of my back pocket for a person 
who is homeless on the streets of 
Ann Arbor, knowing full well that 
my friends are watching, with me 
secretly hoping they think I am 
generous and selfless.

And, like Carrie Bradshaw before 

me I can’t help but ask myself: Does it 
demean the gifts I am giving because 
my motives are not entirely pure? 
Despite my best intentions, could 
this form of paternalism hurt more 
than it helps?

I honestly don’t have the 

answers 
to 
these 
questions. 

But every Thursday morning, I 
am surrounded by supportive 
classmates who ask the same 
questions and worry about how 
to leverage privilege and money 
to build a future focused on 
social justice.

If I were ever to meet one of the 

writers of those ubiquitous think 
pieces about millennials and 
our 
perpetual 
self-absorption 

and complacency, I would point 
them to this classroom. Sure, 
my peers are idealistic, perhaps 
naive 
and 
probably 
indebted 

to a personal foundation of 
various forms of privilege. But 
we’re 
also 
questioning 
what 

we have been granted. We are 
poring 
over 
nonprofits’ 
tax 

returns, 
critiquing 
concepts 

about international development 
and exploring how to revitalize 
Detroit 
without 
gentrifying 

blighted neighborhoods.

The 
policy 
concerns 
of 

our generation are perfectly 
encapsulated in Public Policy 
475 
— 
our 
commitment 
to 

economic, racial and gender 
justice come to the forefront of 
every discussion. We don’t all 
agree on the best approaches 
to these challenges, but our 
commitment to positive change 
unites us.

It also unites the final five 

organizations that have made it 
past our rigorous preliminary 
debates and research. Of these 
organizations, according to the 
stipulations of our grant, we 
can only choose a maximum of 
three. Furthermore, we must 
choose what percentage of the 
pot will be allocated to each 
organization, and whether the 
funding will be restricted to a 
specific project or program.

The process of eliminating 

nine of the originally nominated 
organizations was hard enough. 
I can already tell that these 
final decisions will be the 
toughest — my conscientious 
classmates and I do not take 
this mandate lightly, and we are 
eager to responsibly distribute 
our funds.

At the end of the day, the 

collective emotional investment 
in the learning happening in that 
boardroom in Weill Hall is one of 
the most profound experiences 
of my college career. Whatever 
organizations 
make 
the 
final 

cut will be forces of change, but 
it is not the end goal that has 
already empowered and changed 
me. It is the community 14 other 
millennials and I have built, 
founded on a thoughtful process 
of dialoguing and questioning that 
inspires me beyond the classroom.

Foreigner. 
Conservative. 
Oppressed.
America, 2016: I find myself 

placed 
into 
a 
seemingly 

indestructible 
box 
with 
steel 

reinforcements because of the 
cloth that lies purposefully on my 
head. I wear my hijab by choice, 
and yet those around me see me as 
a helpless, weak woman.

As Islamophobic rhetoric has 

skyrocketed, so too have my 
feelings of helplessness. I watch 
this bloodthirsty beast rear its 
head, straining to break the chains 
that keep it from losing control. 
As a visual artist, I often express 
my frustration through a flow of 
colors onto my canvas. I do this 
in hope that art might crack the 
stereotype I find myself defined 
by, that my work might help 
someone choose love over hate.

Last year, as a senior in high 

school, I began combining my 
artwork into a portfolio I titled 
the Peace Initiative. And within 
a 
year, 
the 
Peace 
Initiative 

has grown into a movement 
greater than I would have ever 
envisioned. It has become a 
campaign to advocate for social 
respect 
and 
equality 
using 

different mediums of creative 
expression. The goal is to put 
up art in public places around 
Ann Arbor and start an online 
campaign through Facebook to 
reach out to those who normally 
would not push themselves to 
meet new people.

Just a few weeks after I 

arrived on campus, my friend 
and I were walking by the 
Diag when we saw a table for 
optiMize — a social innovation 
organization on campus. I didn’t 
think I had any ideas for their 
Social 
Innovation 
Challenge 

— I never thought of myself as 
an innovator, but my friend 
wanted to check it out, so I was 

reluctantly dragged into going 
up to the table.

As we walked up, I met Jeff 

Sorensen, 
a 
co-founder 
of 

optiMize. When he asked me 
if I had any ideas, I told him 
I didn’t. But then he asked 
me another question: “If you 
could 
change 
one 
thing 
to 

make the world a better place, 
what 
would 
you 
change?” 

And 
that 
got 
me 
thinking. 

We spent the next 10 minutes 
talking about Islamophobia and 
discrimination. 
When 
I 
told 

him about my art portfolio, his 
response surprised me: “Well, 
why don’t you apply to the 
Challenge to work on that?”

Suddenly my passion project 

became 
a 
social 
venture. 
I 

reached out to two of my good 
high school friends, Limi Sharif 
and Halimah Ahmad, as well as a 
friend I met in one of my lectures, 
Mariam Reda. As freshmen, we 
came together to channel our 
passion for art as a medium to 
influence social change. Over the 
next seven months, the optiMize 
Challenge gave us a chance to 
begin creating a community of 
individuals 
passionate 
about 

social justice and artists who 
believe art can break barriers.

Through this journey, we have 

realized that Islamophobia is part 
of a larger issue of tense relations 
between 
differing 
cultural 

groups who have not been able 
to relate to one another. A lack 
of interaction between groups, 
because people remain in their 
comfort zones, leads to the rise 
of stigmas and stereotypes. Our 
theme for next semester is the 
“implications of societal trigger 
words” such as feminism, racism, 
activism and all the connotations 
these words carry with them. We 
are a student organization that 
welcomes all artists who want 
to use their art to replace fear 

and hate with compassion and 
understanding. Together, we are 
the Peace Initiative.

Developing this initiative has 

been the most difficult thing 
I have tackled yet, but it has 
also been the most spiritually 
rewarding. The electric positive 
energy flowing through each 
member 
in 
optiMize 
has 

been contagious. I leave each 
workshop 
feeling 
refreshed, 

empowered, 
inspired 
and 

powerful enough to tackle all the 
negativity in the world, without 
allowing it to pull me back down 
in its endless pit.

This project has sparked a 

thirst in me to learn as much 
as I can about social justice. 
I’ve found a purpose for my 
education. Instead of watching 
Netflix, I spend late nights poring 
over scholarly articles on topics 
like race, discrimination and 
Islamophobia. As I delve deeper 
into these topics, I realize I want 
to continue pursuing similar 
endeavors throughout my life.

Graduating high school with a 

class of 70 students, I felt lost in the 
crowd when I arrived on campus. 
I do not feel lost anymore. Thanks 
to the optiMize community, I 
go to bed every night feeling 
confident in myself and what I am 
doing. I wake up every day feeling 
loved and appreciated by the most 
inspiring group of people I could 
have ever imagined.

I do not know what the future 

holds, but I know my friends and I 
will help shape it. optiMize and the 
Peace Initiative have taught me that 
while some people will try to trap 
me in a box, others will see that I 
have wings and encourage me to fly.

Which would you choose?

Teller and Kendrick 
make a terrible film

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

Remember those kids in high 

school who, despite being given 
all the tools for success, refused 
to put forth 
an 
effort 

to make a 
decent proj-
ect? Whose 
final 
prod-

ucts 
ended 

up being so 
god-awful 
they 
must 

have exerted effort to make 
them that horrible? It seems 
that these kids maintained their 
passion for awfulness, moved to 
Hollywood and produced “Get 
a Job.”

From the giveaway title to 

the 
rudimentary 
dialogue, 

there’s no question as to what 
this film is about. “Get a Job” 
details the struggles of Will 
(Miles 
Teller, 
“Whiplash”) 

as he tries to improve life for 
himself and his girlfriend Jil-
lian (Anna Kendrick, “Pitch 
Perfect”) by seeking employ-
ment as a videographer. Will is 
a pathetic excuse for a human 
being, but his three bizarre, 
unsanitary 
and 
substance-

abusing housemates, Charlie 
(Nicholas Braun, “The Perks 
of Being a Wallflower”), Ethan 
(Christopher 
Mintz-Plasse, 

“Superbad”) and Luke (Brandon 
T. Jackson, “Triple Thunder”) 
make the millennial genera-
tion appear absolutely despi-
cable. If you were looking for 
an older, wiser parental figure 
to teach these helpless clowns 
how to get their lives together, 
you won’t find one — Will’s 
father, Roger (Bryan Cranston, 

“Breaking Bad”), becomes com-
pletely delusional on his quest 
for employment. The collective 
strangeness of characters and 
plot suggests that “How Not 
to Get a Job” would serve as a 
more accurate title. 

Once we listen to a few of the 

characters’ conversations, it’s 
obvious why no one wants to 
hire any of them. Their vocabu-
lary is limited to sexual lingo, 
with “dick” “fuck” and “come” 
being 
among 
the 
favorites. 

Then, during the last 20 min-
utes, there’s a dramatic tonal 
shift. Suddenly the film is try-
ing to take itself seriously by 
having each character, in his 
own weird way, preach the 
same idea: it’s not just about 
feeling special, but actually 
being special.

While crude humor may 

have been the intent, the mate-
rial can better be described as 
downright disgusting. Direc-
tor Dylan Kidd starts by test-
ing viewers’ stomachs as they 
are subjected to watching Luke 
chug a mason jar full of deer 
semen in order to obtain his 
own desk at the office. More 
worrisome is the scene where 
a young Asian boy ends up 
unconscious on the gym floor 
after Charlie lobs a basketball 

at him. No one, not even the 
surrounding parents or one of 
his classmates exhibits any sign 
of concern.

Another 
disappointing 

aspect of the film is its por-
trayal of women in power. 
Roger, the old timer in despair, 
basically begs the young baris-
ta, Cammy (newcomer Mimi 
Gianpulos) to fix him. Sure 
enough, a few scenes later, his 
once-graying hair is now solid 
black and Cammy’s constantly 
hanging onto Roger, indicating 
that she’s providing him with 
something more than caffeine 
and hair dye. Meanwhile, his 
son is being controlled by a con-
niving older woman, Kathleen 
Dunn (Marcia Gay Harden, 
“Into the Wild”), who openly 
admits that she’s only promot-
ing Will so she can have more 
control over him.

Of course, this wouldn’t be a 

film about the 20-somethings 
of America if substance abuse 
wasn’t prevalent. While a little 
party never killed nobody, the 
presence of beer and weed is 
so overwhelming in this film 
it might as well be a painfully 
long 
advertisement. 
Alcohol 

isn’t just used to alleviate mis-
ery 
and 
heighten 
euphoria 

— it’s viewed as the key to pro-
fessional success, as demon-
strated by Will’s insistence on 
Roger getting hammered before 
Will records him for his video 
resume. 

No amount of alcohol or mar-

ijuana will ever allow watching 
“Get a Job” to be a non-tortur-
ous experience. At least those 
who make the drunken mistake 
of pressing play can mostly for-
get the ordeal the next day. I 
wish I was so lucky.

FILM REVIEW
Netflix streams the 
sci-fi ‘Advantageous’

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

The 
most 
terrifying 
sci-

ence fiction is not the stuff of 
nightmares, but of reality: dys-
topian worlds 
that 
actually 

loom 
ahead. 

Set in a near-
distant future 
where automa-
tion 
squeez-

es 
humans 

— 
especially 

women — out 
of jobs, the fac-
tors that lead up into the world 
in “Advantageous” have already 
been laid out today. It’s just a 
matter of following the threads 
into years ahead, and watching 
order unravel into quotidian 
chaos.

Facing increasing pressure to 

look younger and more racially 
ambiguous, Gwen loses her job 
(Jacqueline Kim, “Red Doors”) 
as the figurehead of a plastic 
surgery company (ironically 
named the Center for Advanced 
Health and Living). The timing 
couldn’t be worse. She strug-
gles to pony up tuition for her 
daughter, 
Jules’s 
(Samantha 

Kim, “Futurestates”) expen-
sive prep school, her only shot 
at staying in the rapidly disap-
pearing middle class. To get 
her job back, Gwen agrees to 
undergo an invasive full-body 
transplant at a major sacrifice 
to herself. The film follows how 
the decision impacts Gwen and 
Jules’s close relationship.

The world of the future is 

assembled 
quietly. 
Director 

Jennifer Phang (“Half Life”) 
economizes 
her 
shoestring 

budget, using minimal CGI for 
a realistic blend of present day 
and high-tech urban skylines. 
Overly precocious children and 
stiff dialogue reveals an evolved 
communication form that pri-
oritizes facts, speed and logic. 
Throwaway dialogue hints at an 
AI economic takeover, as well as 
possible terrorist uprisings and 
rising child prostitution due to 
soaring unemployment rates 
– all events that could reason-
ably occur in the near future. 
Still, nothing is ever explained 
outright; the viewer draws the 
connections themselves. The 
expository narrative is revealed 
seamlessly, leaving the dialogue 
nimble and the focus on Gwen 
and Jules’s relationship.

With glacial lighting and ele-

gant cinematography, the pac-
ing is deliberately restrained 
so that the nuances in the rela-
tionship between Gwen and 
Jules can flourish. Gwen faces 
a catch-22 where she must sac-

rifice herself to give her daugh-
ter a leg up in the capitalist rat 
race, but to do so would rob 
Jules of an intimate relation-
ship with her mother. The film 
questions what it truly means to 
be “advantageous” in a chang-
ing world. The only pitfall is 
that for all its careful buildup, 
in the last half-hour, the film 
feels anxious to race to its fin-
ish line.

Directed by an Asian-Amer-

ican woman and featuring a 
diverse cast, “Advantageous” 
also marks a successful leap in 
media representation. It ques-
tions the pressures that society 
places on women, features mid-
dle-aged characters actually 
played by middle-aged actors, 
and gives Asian actors non-ste-
reotypical, multi-faceted roles. 
The story “Advantageous” tells 
is ultimately its own, not one 
where identity is used as a plot 
point.

Like any science fiction film, 

“Advantageous” 
occasionally 

questions the humans-versus-
technology 
distinction. 
But 

above all, it’s first and foremost 
a story of mothers, daughters 
and providing for those you 
love. Situated among technolo-
gies that can perform faster, 
and more efficiently, charac-
ters ask themselves, “why am 
I alive?” and overwhelming-
ly, Gwen’s fierce love for her 
daughter is the answer, ground-
ing the reason for life in emo-
tional connection.

Advantageous is streaming on 

Netflix.

EVENT PREVIEW
‘Guys and Dolls’ 
brings NYC to A2

SMTD celebrates 

Frank Sinatra 
centennial with 
classic musical

By MERIN MCDIVITT

Daily Arts Writer

As the world celebrates Frank 

Sinatra’s centennial, songs, trib-
ute concerts and even figure 
skating 
rou-

tines 
paying 

homage to the 
beloved 
Rat 

Pack 
mem-

ber are every-
where. 
But 

the School of 
Music, Theatre 
and 
Dance’s 

nod to the leg-
endary crooner 
comes in a dif-
ferent 
form 

altogether. 
This weekend, 
the Power Center will usher 
audiences into a different era, 
where the bright lights and shad-
owy side streets of New York 
City give way to Prohibition-era 
Cuba, swaying with Jazz Age 
rhythms.

After taking on “American 

Idiot” last fall, the musical the-
ater program was ready for a 
blast from the past.

“We wanted to do something 

with more traditional musical 
theater to balance it,” said direc-
tor Mark Madama, an associate 
professor of music. “It’s going to 
be fun. It’s going to be colorful. 
It’s going to be exciting.”

The classic musical showcases 

Sinatra’s talents alongside those 
of Marlon Brando and Jean Sim-
mons in its 1955 film version, but 
the show’s real origin lies a little 
earlier, in 1950, when it debuted 
on Broadway. “Guys and Dolls” 
charmed audiences and swept 
the Tony Awards, worming its 
way into the American zeitgeist 
in a way few cultural phenomena 
ever do.

Its vivid portrayal of the seedy 

underbelly of New York City has 
inspired countless imitations 
and riffs. It popularized the 
multi-ethnic slang of this col-
orful era in Manhattan, bring-
ing words like “fly-by-night” (a 
short-lived romance) and “the 
heat” (the police) into popu-
lar consciousness. So deeply is 
“Guys and Dolls” intertwined 
with American culture that if 
you’re ever near Detroit, you can 
stop by Little Guys and Dolls 
Preschool on Six Mile Road. 
One can’t help but imagine tap-
dancing toddlers playing craps 
or maybe a couple of kindergar-
teners placing bets at the races.

The spirited world of “Guys 

and Dolls” will be on full dis-
play at the Power Center thanks 
to set designer Edward Morris, 
an alumnus who has worked 
all over show business since his 
time at the University of Michi-
gan. The click-clack of tap shoes 
will echo through the theater 
as the set flashes and shimmers 
with an overwhelming profusion 
of neon signs that has rendered 
the stage almost unrecognizable 
— a bustling metropolis in the 
middle of a college town.

One of the show’s many unex-

pected delights is the high-
quality writing — in addition to 

captivating musical numbers, 
the show packs jokes and refer-
ences slung at the audience as 
rapid-fire as a sawed-off shotgun 
in a Havana alleyway. The script 
was so well-received that it near-
ly won the 1951 Pulitzer Prize for 
Drama. Sadly, writer Abe Bur-
rows was under investigation by 
the House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee, an investiga-
tive Congressional committee 
whose activities during the time 
mirrored then-U.S. Sen. Joseph 
McCarthy’s 
anti-Communist 

push. That push ruined many a 
career in media. Burrows con-
tinued to write, but his Pulitzer 
aspirations were dashed forever. 
His script for “Guys and Dolls,” 
however, remains one of the best 
in the business.

“I love the idea of doing a tra-

ditional musical comedy that has 
a great book,” Madama said.

Before television took off in 

a big way in the late 1950s and 
variety shows began to dominate 
the airwaves, Broadway musi-
cals were an outlet for some of 
show business’s most talented 
writers. Dialogue was snappy 
and inventive, leaving perform-
ers plenty of wiggle room to 
bring life to their characters.

“Every character that gets 

played by a different person 
brings a different interpretation 
to that character,” Madama said. 
“They have to bring their own 
personality.”

From salsa to tap, romantic 

duets to an athletic “crapshoot-
er’s ballet,” “Guys and Dolls” is 
as engaging, relevant and just 
plain funny today as it was when 
the Chairman of the Board held 
court at the Rainbow Room.

New Atlanta is no doubt indebt-

ed to their ubiquitous triplet flow.

Quavo, likely the group’s most 

known member on account of his 
features (gracing Donnie Trum-
pet’s Surf and a number of Young 
Thug’s tracks) was at the lead as 
the night took off. He posed for 
pictures, hyped up the crowd, 
and represented the University of 
Michigan in a Denard Robinson 
jersey. Offset was the only mem-
ber not donning Michigan attire, 

but his Mike Tyson Supreme tee 
was more than acceptable for the 
occasion.

Most of their first raps went 

unrecognized by the audience, as 
they bobbed best they could in the 
unfriendly-to-standing Hill audi-
torium. The venue was admittedly 

unfit for this kind of high-energy 
hip-hop show, but the energy 
picked up as the group segued 
into more known territory. The 
drop of “Hannah Montana” was 
synchronized with a not whol-
ly unexpected Jim Harbaugh 
appearance, who jumped around 
stage for a bit and, of course, 
dabbed — much to the apprecia-
tion of the crowd. Water bottles 
flew through the air as kids threw 
their faces into their arms. That 
moment was the clear highlight 
for the night, where Migos and 
the audience seemed most in sync 
with one another.

The majority of the night 

moved quickly back and forth 
between those kinds of radio-hit 
highlights, and slower moments 
when the members called out 
their raps like lists, leaving the 
audience to stand back and appre-
ciate (or check their phones). The 
front of the venue was filled with 
kids dabbing with one hand and 
taking a selfie with the other. To 
Migos’ credit, they seemed to 
gauge the room relatively well, 
doling out popular tracks when 
they were needed and interacting 
with the audience when the per-
formance slowed. That was clear 
during the DJ Carnage-produced 
track “Bricks,” as the lights shut 
off and the group called for the 
room to turn on their phones 

(lighters are out these days). Dim 
iPhones waved around as the 
members rattled off their verses 
and jumped with the crowd, 
another high-energy point of the 
show. 

Sometime around “Handsome 

and Wealthy,” the group jumped 
off stage and into the crowd. Take-
off climbed over a row of seats and 
danced with the students for most 
of the track, much to the disap-
proval of the classically-trained 
security team.

Not too long after that high-

intensity 
crowd 
interaction, 

Migos left, possibly mid-song, and 
the slightly confused audience 
tentatively filed out, to murmurs 
of “Wait, is it over?” It was a fitting 
ending to a very stop-and-start 
event. The peaks of the night, 
though, still remained. Daps were 
exchanged and Migos left with a 
salute, their work here still unfin-
ished.

For those wondering, they 

were, apparently, headed towards 
Rick’s for an afterparty.

The best lessons of a 
Screen Arts degree

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

This could be the last time I 

write about film.

After four years of film studies, 

I’m left feeling a bit lost. Looking 
out into the real world, I see a wide 
range of careers that are exciting 
and bright and possible — I see 
many less that match up with the 
knowledge base I’ve spent my col-
lege career building. So I’m left 
wondering, where is the value in 
what I’ve spent my time in Ann 
Arbor learning? When will I find 
the purpose in watching every 
single movie with a (maybe too) 
Freudian lens? Is it worth four 
years of tuition to be able to detect 
the Truffaut reference in a Child-
ish Gambino lyric? Do I sound pre-
tentious when I refer to movies as 
“films?”

Boiling down all of the test-

cramming, 
paper-writing, 

big-book-reading and class-dis-
cussion-navigating, I can really 
only come up with two main ideas. 
One: Film is everything around us, 
all-encompassing and reflective. 
Two: Our opinions are the most 
and least important part.

It’s an upside-down and inside-

out and very non-deductively valid 
argument. But I’m going to try. 
Premise one: Everything we are 
is reflected in film. Give people a 
camera, a projector and time, and 
they have the tools to explain to 
anyone watching what makes up 
the important stuff of their lives. 
We tend to think of the world from 
our classic, Hollywood-centric 
bubble, but there is a national 
cinema to represent nearly every 
country and an identifiable impor-

tance in doing so. In the 1960s, the 
French government initiated a 
program that paid screenwriters 
big money just to write a script and 
potentially shoot it. Documenting 
their young people’s voices and 
exporting them to the world as an 
image of what it was to be French 
was a national priority. In Nazi 
Germany, Soviet Russia and early 
Communist China, propaganda 
film schools sprung up with gov-
ernment funding. The power of 
moving images was recognized 
as an invincibly strong force in 
regimes known most for their 
extreme violence. Writing with 
your camera, referred to in some 
theory as the caméra-stylo, gives 
a somewhat invisible strength to 
those filming, wielded both posi-
tively and negatively.

Premise two: Our opinions 

towards a given film are the most 
and least important part. No type 
of movie is objectively better than 
another, and no matter what you 
think, it’s impossible to distill what 
we see on screen in terms of what’s 
“good” or “bad.” I’m one of the 
worst offenders of this. As a film 
critic, I spend my movie-watching 
time judging what works and what 
doesn’t, what you should like or 
disown, what letter grade to give a 
work that people have spent years 
of effort and millions of dollars on.

But in the end, everyone’s a 

critic. The reasons you like or dis-
like a movie are entirely personal, 
and it’s futile to judge those that 
have won awards or had successful 
runs at the box office as inherently 
better or smarter. I once watched 
acclaimed writer Nick Delbanco 
be unable to control his loud laugh 
through an entire screening of 

“Clueless.” I’ve learned my most 
valuable lessons from professors 
who spend years analyzing big 
ideas, like the impact of nations’ 
underground cinema movements 
on colonialism, and then easily 
turn around and geek out over the 
latest “Transformers” blockbuster. 
Films hold the value we impart 
on them. They give us a lens into 
ourselves, and yes, maybe some 
are uncomfortable and scary and 
weird. But there’s a reason you 
feel this way, so let’s explore it. 
Filmmaking is such an exciting 
mix of the most basic, traditional 
storytelling and the wildest, most 
advanced technology, so let’s do 
whatever we want with it. There is 
no such thing as a guilty pleasure 
movie, so let’s watch everything. 

Looking at these ideas, I think 

I’ve come to the conclusion that, 
like many degrees, the value in 
studying film lies primarily in the 
ability to learn. The film major at 
the University of Michigan is not 
called a film major; it’s deemed 
“Screen Arts and Cultures.” It took 
me a while to figure out why this 
was. Film teaches us that there is 
no sense of normal in the world, 
and that our personal backgrounds 
each represent only one of a world 
of experiences. By watching and 
digesting the images on screen, 
we learn how to learn from other 
cultures, people, lives. We revise 
our idea of what it is to see, we dip 
through different time periods 
and nations on screen, we spin 
into trails of thought and connec-
tion we never before thought to try 
and understand. And hopefully, all 
this watching equips us to handle 
an equally unexpected world. I’m 
pretty sure I’m ready for that.

FILM NOTEBOOK

‘Shameless’ finale 
can’t tie the knot

Sixth season of 
Showtime series 
ends on down note

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

“Shameless” doesn’t shy away 

from darkness. In fact, it embrac-
es it. The Gallagher family’s mis-
fortune, and 
their 
abil-

ity to bear 
it in some 
of the most 
unimagi-
nable ways, 
is central to 
the 
series. 

The 
season 

finale is no 
exception to this theme. How-
ever, the execution falls flat. 

With each finale comes time 

to reflect on the trajectory the 
lives of each character have 
taken. And this season, their 
stories have diverged quite a bit 
from one another, furthering 
the narrative from what holds 
it all together — the family’s 
relationship. Lip (Jeremy Allen 
White, 
“Afterschool”) 
works 

his way down a self-destructive 
path at college. Frank (Wil-
liam H. Macy, “Fargo”) is pre-
occupied with his old flame 
Queenie (Sherilyn Fenn, “Twin 
Peaks”). Ian pursues a career 
as an E.M.T. alongside his new, 
surprisingly normal boyfriend 
Caleb (Jeff Pierre, “Drumline: A 
New Beat”). Debbie (Emma Ken-
ney, “Epic”) veers out on her own 
to look after her baby. The fam-
ily has become a decentralized 
unit with Fiona (Emmy Rossum, 
“The Phantom of the Opera”) 
left desperately trying to anchor 
it down in time for her wedding.

Every once in a while, Fiona 

catches a break — an opportu-
nity to be happy without having 
to consider anyone else’s needs 
but her own. Sean (Dermot Mul-
roney, “The Grey”) serves as not 
only her break, but as a source of 
comfort to guide Fiona through 
the aftermath of her imprison-
ment, arguably her lowest point 
in the series. Though his pres-
ence provides a sense of stability 
in the constant flux that is the 
lives of the series’s characters, 
he brings his own set of prob-
lems to the table. A former drug 
addict, Sean must deal with the 
consequences of his harrowing 
past while building a relation-
ship with Fiona.

Though Sean hired Ian (Cam-

eron Monaghan, “The Giver”) 
when no one else would and 
helped Carl (Ethan Cutkosky, 
“The Unborn”) cut his ties with 
a neighborhood gang, Fiona’s 
fear that he’ll fall off the wagon 
lurks in the part of her mind that 
tells her she can’t have a happy, 
stable relationship. This anxiety 
is understandable, given her pat-
tern of falling into doomed rela-
tionships. When the two hastily 
decide to get married, we can’t 
help but feel that Fiona is headed 
towards yet another letdown.

This feeling pervades the pre-

nuptial bliss that Fiona and Sean 
artificially act out — buying wed-
ding bands, taking dance les-
sons and discussing their future 

lives together. Her eager wed-
ding preparations seem stilted, 
almost too happy — as if we’re 
being strung along to believe 
their wedding will go as planned 
even though (given the show’s 
history), we know it likely won’t. 
This feeling defines the show’s 
appeal. Its ability to draw us into 
its story, forge our attachment 
to its characters, then snatch it 
all out from under us just often 
enough to instill a nagging sense 
that at any moment anything can 
take a turn for the worse.

And then it does.
Frank comes barreling in to 

the ceremony with the news that 
Sean is still using. Fiona’s devas-
tated, Sean’s relationship with 
his son is irreparably strained 
and Frank is once again happily 
the root of all this. The subtle 
poignancy of this tragic moment 
for the show’s protagonist con-
trasts with the building tension 
leading up to it — as we’re led to 
believe Frank is going to kill Sean 
when he buys a gun earlier in 
the episode. Even the beginning 
of the episode conveys a drasti-
cally different tone through its 
slow camera movements, which 
slowly pan through the Galla-
gher house as Frank urinates 
in Sean’s shoes and steals his 
money.

Frank’s irrational longing to 

destroy Sean after a showdown 
between the two in Fiona’s home 
is like nothing we’ve ever seen 
of his character. His motivation, 
usually a greedy, alcohol-fueled 
lust for some self-serving out-
come, is unclear. Whether he’s 
stung that his family is finally 
refusing to put up with his ego-
tistical antics or has his daugh-
ter’s interests at heart is blurry. 
Regardless, his actions carry the 
impact they always do — a mud-
dled trail of heartbreak and 
devastation. And just like that, 
a relationship we’ve been root-
ing for all season is curtly put 
to an end. The most disappoint-
ing part of it is that Sean doesn’t 
even try to explain himself or 
win her back. He simply subsides 
into the long list of disappoint-
ments that characterize Fiona’s 
love life. 

The finale ends with one of 

the most pivotal questions in the 
story: what’s Lip going to do? 
His slow decline down Frank’s 
alcoholic path culminates in a 
meltdown that’s been a long time 
coming. In each episode, we only 
glimpse a small misstep on Lip’s 
way to completely screwing up 
his life. The impending feeling 
that Lip is going to end up back 
where he worked so hard to 
get away from creeps up on us 
throughout the season. Though 
it isn’t surprising that Lip is 
the root of his own undoing, it 
raises the question: “why now?” 
His self destructive behavior 
has always been one of his most 
salient traits, one that is put to 
the test when his professor pays 
for him to go to rehab. However, 
we are left with him standing 
outside — whether he goes in or 
not is question to be answered by 
the next season. 

The season finale is a disap-

pointing end to an even more 
disappointing 
season. 
The 

series seems to have run Frank’s 
course. The dramatic tension 

he provides is arbitrary, and at 
times even frustrating. By lead-
ing Frank through the motions 
of preparing to kill Sean, then 
destroying his relationship with 
Fiona in one fell swoop instead, 
the show points to its own des-
perate attempt to produce a 
compelling ending that leaves 
the characters reeling yet again. 
Rather than sharply honing in 
on a dramatic plot point with the 
greatest potential to develop into 
the next season, the show lazily 
repeats past narratives and kicks 
down its protagonist once again 
— this time, with seemingly 
nowhere to move forward.

Wolverines blank Michigan State

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING — It took five 

innings, but the No. 2 Michigan 
softball team finally found its 
trademark 
offense.

After 

four frames, 
the Wolverines’ offense looked 
lost against Michigan State (2-8 
Big Ten, 20-20 overall). Michigan 
reached base just two times — 
once on an error and once on a 
single — and failed to get a runner 
in scoring position. It seemed 
uncharacteristic of a team sitting 
at the top of nearly every offensive 
category in the Big Ten.

Once the fifth inning began, 

the Wolverines (8-2, 30-4) took a 
lead they would never relinquish, 
defeating the Spartans, 3-0, on 
Wednesday at Secchia Stadium.

Junior Lindsay Montemarano 

started the offensive surge by 
lining the first pitch up the middle. 
Michigan’s 
next 
two 
batters 

reached base on singles. After a fly 
out, the Wolverines had the bases 
loaded with only one out.

Abby Ramirez then stepped 

to the plate and hit a ground ball 
up the middle. Spartan shortstop 
Jacquie Reiser made an impressive 
diving play, stopping the ball in 
the infield. But Montemarano still 
scored, giving Michigan its first 
run. Later in the inning, through a 
fielding error and a wild pitch, the 
Wolverines scored twice more to 
give them insurance runs.

While the offense struggled 

early in the game, junior right-
hander Megan Betsa stymied 
Michigan 
State’s 
hitters. 
She 

struck out 13 batters in seven 
innings for her fifth shutout of 
the season and walked just three. 
Betsa maintained control over the 
Spartan lineup and it took until 
the sixth inning for Michigan 
State to put two runners on base. 
Each of Betsa’s strikeouts came 

from swings and misses and she 
frequently got two strikes on 
hitters.

After struggling in her last 

start against Nebraska on Sunday, 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
took Betsa out of the game in the 
first inning. She later returned to 
the game in the third inning as a 
replacement for fifth-year senior 
Sara Driesenga and earned the 
win. In relief, she allowed only one 
baserunner.

“I found my rhythm and they 

didn’t get any hits (Sunday at 
Nebraska),” Betsa said. “I think I 
found my groove the second half 
of that last game, I felt good. My 
spin was really good today, it was 
moving, and I felt confident in the 
circle.”

Michigan, 
which 
constantly 

scores first and often sees runners 
reach base in the first inning, did 
something its offense had not done 

since its game against Washington 
on February 27 — The Wolverines 
went down in order.

Betsa, 
though, 
remain 

undeterred despite her hitters’ 
early troubles.

“(I wanted to) spin the ball 

through the zone and put zeroes 
on the board,” Betsa said.

Michigan attained a necessary 

Big Ten win, but it still showed 
some of the mistakes on the 
basepaths 
that 
it 
did 
last 

weekend. In the second inning, 
Montemarano hit a line drive to 
the first baseman who gloved it 
and immediately tagged first base 
to double off senior outfielder 
Mary Sbonek. It could explain why 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
chose to hold up Montemarano 
at third on the fly ball in the fifth 
inning, taking a more conservative 
approach.

The Wolverines were pleased 

with Betsa’s effort, regardless 
of their offensive struggles. In 
Wednesday’s game, though, but 
Michigan maintained its lead, its 
players weren’t entirely satisfied 
with its offensive output.

“We’re always confident in each 

other, that’s one of the great things 
about this team,” Montemarano 
said. “We have the mindset that 
it’s OK if you don’t get it done, my 
teammates behind me are gonna 
get it done. I think we really had 
confidence that Megan could get it 
done, but we’re never comfortable 
with one run, two runs, 10 runs, 20 
runs, we’re always going up there 
looking to get more runs.”

The Wolverines didn’t score 

15 runs as they did against South 
Carolina early this year. They 
didn’t even mount the eight they 
tabbed 
against 
Nebraska 
last 

weekend. 

But they did just enough to win. 

Hutchins brings fire 
to Michigan huddle

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING — After four 

innings of back-and-forth play, 
the score sat deadlocked at 0-0, 
and the No. 2 Michigan softball 
team found itself in unfamiliar 
territory.

Accustomed to scoring early 

and 
often, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

bats had fallen cold against the 
Spartans. Inning after inning 
passed, and Michigan simply 
couldn’t put runs on the board.

Watching her team struggle 

to make solid contact and string 
hits together, Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins needed to rally 
the troops.

Hutchins regularly huddles up 

with the team between innings. 
She opens the conversation in 
the center of the huddle and then 
walks out, leaving the players 
to finish it before they take the 
field or enter the dugout. Her 
comments are typically short, 
sweet and to the point. But before 
the top of the fifth, she took an 
extended period of time driving 
her message home, seeking to 
light a fire under her team to push 
them forward.

“Things weren’t going our 

way offensively and I was mad 
about it.” Hutchins said. “I did 
not like our energy at the plate, 
but I said, ‘Look I’m going to get 
over it because we still have an 
opportunity in front of us and we 
need to focus on that. So I’ll get 
over it if you’ll get over it because 
you’ve got to get over the past.’ ”

When the Wolverines broke the 

huddle, a revitalized Michigan 
emerged. Junior third baseman 
Lindsay Montemarano stepped 
into the batter’s box first and took 
all of one pitch to lace a single 
into right field. After junior left 

fielder Kelly Christner laid down 
a bunt, sophomore designated 
player 
Amanda 
Vargas 
sent 

another single to right. In just 
three at-bats after the timeout, 
the bases were loaded with no 
outs, and the Wolverines were in 
business.

Junior shortstop Abby Ramirez 

took advantage of the situation 
with an infield grounder to 
second base that rolled just slowly 
enough to allow Montemarano 
to race home from third base. 
Michigan had finally broken the 
deadlock, and it was just warming 
up.

The bases were loaded again 

with two outs, and the Wolverines 
were in prime position to do 
major damage with senior second 
baseman Sierra Romero coming 
up. Romero smacked a hard-
hit ball toward the shortstop, 
who couldn’t corral it, allowing 
Christner to score. Moments 
later, a wild pitch gave Michigan 
its third and final run.

After four innings of subpar 

hitting, the Wolverines broke 
through for the 3-0 win.

“We were playing a little tight, 

we weren’t being super aggressive 
and we weren’t putting good cuts 
on the ball.” Montemarano said. 
“Hutch reminded us that we’re 
good hitters and that we need to 
trust our preparation.

“If we could just trust our 

process and be aggressive and go 
up there looking for something 
in the zone — not looking for a 
perfect pitch — good things will 
happen.”

When Michigan needed to 

get its motor running, Hutchins 
took her time in the center of the 
huddle. Her message resonated 
with the Wolverines, and in a 
close encounter, that made all the 
difference.

Carol Hutchins fired up her team before a three-run fifth inning in Michigan’s 3-0 win Wednesday over Michigan State.

Yurovsky’s accolades 
only part of her legacy

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

Standing in the spectator area 

at the Varsity Tennis Center, 
Ronit Yurovsky looked up at 
the ceiling. She had just been 
asked how she wanted to be 
remembered as her four-year 
career comes to a close, and she 
was exclaiming that she couldn’t 
believe her college career was 
almost over.

Then, 
Yurovsky 
paused, 

deciding how to answer. 

In her time at Michigan, 

Yurovsky has earned a top-50 
singles ranking in all three of 
her seasons, earned Big Ten 
Freshman of the Year and ITA 
Midwest Rookie of the Year in 
2013, is a two-time Academic 
All-American and has earned 
three invitations to the NCAA 
Singles Championships. 

But instead, when Yurovsky’s 

long pause ended, none of those 
accolades made their way into 
her answer.

“I just want (people) to know 

that I competed so hard on the 
court,” Yurovsky said. “Every 
time I stepped on the court, I 
gave it my all. I played for this 
school 
and 
represented 
the 

block ‘M’ on my shirt, because 
that’s the only thing that really 
matters. I just hope people know 
that when I was out there, that 
I would have given everything 
that I have.”

A 
lot 
was 
expected 
of 

Yurovsky 
even 
before 
she 

arrived at Michigan — she was 
the 2012 NHSCA Senior Athlete 
of the Year for tennis. Now in her 
senior season, she has also had 
to take on a leadership role in 
addition to her job as one of the 
team’s anchors. After the 2014-
15 campaign, the Wolverines 
lost 
three 
seniors: 
Emina 

Bektas, Sarah Lee and Kristen 
Dodge. All three were looked 
to as leaders of the program by 
everyone on the team, including 

Yurovsky.

With their departures, it was 

Yurovsky’s turn to step into the 
role of team captain.

“(Naming 
Yurovsky 
team 

captain) is not just because she’s 
our senior,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni 
Bernstein. 
“Obviously 

she’s a great player, but she’s even 
a better person. 
She represents 
what we’re all 
about.”

This 
year, 

a 
new 
wave 

of 
younger 

players 
has 

entered 
the 

fray. 
Six 
of 

the 
eight 

members 
on 

the 
Michigan 

roster 
are 
freshmen 
or 

sophomores, 
including 

freshmen 
Brienne 
Minor 

and Kate Fahey, who — like 
Yurovsky 
— 
have 
earned 

individual national rankings in 
their debut seasons.

But part of the Wolverines’ 

success, both as a team and as 
individuals, can be attributed 
to the experience of Yurovsky. 
Her attitude both on and off the 
court have set an example for the 
rest of the team.

“She’s laughing, she’s happy, 

she 
keeps 
people 
loose,” 

Bernstein said. “The kids know 
once she steps on the court, she’s 
all business. But off the court, 
she’s just great to have around.”

Added 
sophomore 
Alex 

Najarian: “She is always wanting 
to help us do better on the court 
and off the court … She just 
wants the best for everybody 
around her in everything that 
she does, whether or not it 
seems like it’s in your best 
interest at the time.”

For a player who has had 

so much individual success, 
Yurovsky reflects most fondly 
on the success that the team 
has had in her time with the 

Wolverines, especially last year, 
when Michigan won the Big Ten 
Tournament Championship for 
the first time since 1997.

“That was pretty special when 

we finally won it,” Yurovsky said. 
“We beat Ohio State in the finals, 
which was pretty good. That was 
so memorable, because we were 

the (regular-
season) 
Big 
Ten 

champs, 
but 

winning that 
tournament 
was 
pretty 

special.”

But 
now, 

Yurovsky’s 
time 
with 

Michigan 
is 

running 
out. 

With just four matches left in the 
regular season, it won’t be long 
until the Wolverines will have to 
move on. That won’t be easy. As 
evidenced by the way with which 
people in the program talk about 
her and her impressive resume, 
Yurovsky has left an indelible 
mark on the program.

“It’s her character,” Bernstein 

said. “She’s competed so hard 
for us, but it’s more the person 
that she is. I have complete trust 
in her, and you never doubt her 
intention in anything.”

That hard work and those 

good intentions are in the back 
of Yurovsky’s mind, too.

Back in the Varsity Tennis 

Center, as Yurovsky considered 
her ideal legacy, she added: “I 
wasn’t going to walk off the 
court unless I gave it my all.”

In just over a month, the 

women’s 
tennis 
season 
will 

be over. Yurovsky will have 
walked off of the court for the 
last time, leaving a sparkling 
career behind her. And though 
her statistics may be forgotten, 
the example she has set and the 
impression she has left on her 
teammates and coaches is built 
to last. 

“I just want 

(people) to know 
that I competed 

so hard.”

‘M’ tops Eastern Michigan

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

Coming into its Wednesday 

game against Eastern Michigan, 
the Michigan baseball team was 
in a rough 
patch. 
It 
had 

suffered its 
first home loss this past weekend, 
had been pummeled Tuesday 
in East Lansing and had been 
struggling to hit. 

The Wolverines (3-2 Big Ten, 

22-9 overall) were ready to take 
out their frustration. Not only did 
they best the Eagles (13-17) at Ray 
Fisher Stadium, they won, 19-3. 

Matt 
Ramsay 
started 
the 

damage in the first inning with 
two consecutive stolen bases and 
the first run of the day — sparking 
the team’s early 4-0 lead. 

“I love stealing bases — that’s 

part of my game,” the fifth-
year senior said. “We picked up 
on some of their tells early on 
in the game, and (the Eastern 
Michigan pitchers) were pretty 
slow to the plate. So I knew if I 
got on base early I would have the 
opportunity to steal some bases. 
Luckily, I was safe.” 

Senior 
centerfielder 
Cody 

Bruder led the team’s charge 
with 
five 
runs 
batted 
in 

and 
4-for-5 
hitting. 
Other 

impressive 
performances 

came from four pinch-hitters 
Bakich put in the bottom of 
the seventh. Two of the pinch-
hitters were freshman Jimmy 
Kerr, who had two runs, and 
sophomore Matt Ross, who got 
his first collegiate hit.

“I’m happy we won, but I’m 

more pleased with the way we 
played,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “(Ross) has been patient 
for 30 games and was finally able 
to play in the 31st (of the season) 
and then gets his first hit. You 
can’t draw it up better than that. 
(Kerr) delivers a quality at-bat 
that’s resulted in a base hit every 
time. Maybe we need to start 
giving them more opportunities.” 

Added Kerr: “I want to take 

every opportunity to get on base 
and to get an RBI. I wanted to 
keep the inning going and just get 
to the next guy.” 

Eastern 
Michigan 
made 

six 
pitching 
substitutions, 

starting in the top of the second. 
Freshman Gary Clift Jr. made 
his 
first 
career 
appearance 

and struck out Michigan’s first 
batter, freshman Ako Thomas, 
keeping Michigan off the board 
in the inning.

In the bottom of the third, the 

Wolverines extended their lead 
by four more runs, including 
a bases-clearing double to left 
field by fifth-year senior Dominc 
Jamett. 

The Eagles 

were 
still 

scoreless 
in 

the top of the 
fifth, so Bakich 
took 
the 

opportunity 
to 
substitute 

in 
freshman 

pitcher 
Troy 

Miller for Nutof.

“It was great to put the game 

away early,” Ramsay said. “I 
think a lot of it has do with the 
pitchers, (Nutof) did a good job 
of staying in the zone and being 
low in the zone and incorporating 
his defense by staying low in the 
strikes. I think when you have 
pitchers filling up that space it just 
makes the defense better.” 

Eastern Michigan got on the 

board in the seventh inning when 

Eagle 
junior 
catcher 
Jeremy 

Stidham tripled to right center. 
Stidham scored the first run of 
the day for his team — it just 
wasn’t nearly enough. 

Michigan finished with 19 

runs and nine Wolverines scored. 
Junior catcher Harrison Wenson, 
Benedetti and Bruder all scored 
four runs each. 

But though Jamett — who 

played as catcher later in the game 
— didn’t tally any runs, Bakich 
thinks 
the 
designated 
hitter 

was instrumental to the team’s 

success despite 
his 
minimal 

playing 
time 

this season.

“He’s 
a 

senior, he’s a 
captain 
and 

he stands for 
all 
the 
right 

things,” Bakich 

said. “He represents everything 
that’s great about Michigan. He’s 
cemented into the foundation 
of the program. I thought it was 
an opportunity he deserved. He 
knows that he just wants to make 
a positive contribution anyway 
he can and he was happy to take 
advantage of that today.”

Bakich made it clear that he 

felt Michigan not only won the 
game, it won each inning. That’s 
a feeling he’s happy to get back.

Jordan says goodbye to ‘M’ at end-of-season banquet

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

A newly minted head coach, 

LaVall 
Jordan 
walked 
onto 

the floor at Crisler Center on 
Wednesday for 
the 
Michigan 

men’s basketball 
team’s 
postseason 
awards 

ceremony. He made a beeline for 
John Beilein and gave his former 
boss a hug.

After six years on Beilein’s staff, 

Jordan says he finally gets it.

“It comes at you quick, and 

there’s decisions to make,” Jordan 
said.

The move “26 inches over,” from 

the assistant coach to the head 
coach’s seat, has changed Jordan’s 
perspective ever since he accepted 
the head-coaching position at 
the 
University 
of 
Wisconsin-

Milwaukee last week. There’s 
simply a level of accountability 
at the head-coaching level that’s 
impossible to envision or prepare 
for, Jordan said. 

So after years of trying to 

understand the inner workings of 
Beilein’s mind, Jordan finally got 
a real glimpse inside. Though he’s 
spoken with Beilein daily since 
accepting the Milwaukee job, the 
hug was still necessary.

Jordan will have a familiar face 

alongside him as he takes over at 
the Panthers’ helm. Pending a few 
dotted Is and crossed Ts, Michigan 
video coordinator Will Vergollo 
will become one of Jordan’s first 
hires.

The loss of Jordan, known as 

something of a guru for backcourt 
players, is a big hit to Beilein’s 
staff, 
which 
has 
remained 

perfectly intact for the last six 

seasons.

“In my opinion, he’s one of the 

best in the business at what he 
does,” said senior guard Spike 
Albrecht.

In Jordan’s absence, director 

of player personnel Chris Hunter 
will 
hit 
the 
recruiting 
trail 

alongside Beilein. In the last week, 
the rest of Michigan’s staff gave 
Hunter the go-ahead to actually 
coach players during workouts, 
and Beilein said Hunter impressed 
immediately with an observation 
about rising sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner’s mechanics.

Beilein 
didn’t 
rule 
out 

considering 
Hunter 
for 
the 

position, but said he’s in no rush to 
make a decision.

“Measure twice so you only 

have to cut once,” Beilein said, 
saying that even the Pope 
would have to go through a 

background-check process were 
he to apply for the position.

The vacancy could soon gain a 

twin, as Michigan assistant Bacari 
Alexander remains among the 
rumored candidates for the still-
unfilled head-coaching position at 
Detroit. But in the meantime, it’s 
business as usual.

“He’s 
going 
on 
the 
road 

(recruiting) this weekend,” Beilein 
said.

In terms of players, Beilein 

still 
doesn’t 
expect 
further 

attrition after Ricky Doyle and 
Aubrey Dawkins announced their 
departures from the program 
last week, and says he’s checked 
in with everybody on the roster 
regarding their status for next 
year.

“That’s the plan with everybody 

right now,” Beilein said.

Wagner 
was 
among 
the 

players whose summer plans 
were most in flux, but he appears 
to have solidified them: Beilein 
said Wagner will spend the early 
months of summer at home in 

Germany before returning for 
July and August to participate 
in “Camp Sanderson,” strength 
coach Jon Sanderson’s famed 
summer workout series.
