ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Ethics committee 
recommendation 
generates debate 
during meeting

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Calls to remove a Central 

Student 
Government 

representative after members 
of Students Allied for Freedom 
and 
Democracy 
questioned 

his 
conduct 
at 
their 
Diag 

demonstration 
continued 
to 

generate discussion at Tuesday’s 
CSG meeting — even after 
the body’s ethics commission 
decided Monday it would not 
seek disciplinary measures.

At 
Tuesday’s 
meeting, 

members of SAFE reiterated 
their concerns regarding the 
conduct of CSG Rep. Jesse 
Arm, the LSA sophomore who 
was filmed loudly criticizing 
and 
SAFE 
members 
who 

were holding a demonstration 
designed to imitate an Israeli 
checkpoint last month. The 
group called for his dismissal 
from the assembly soon after.

The incident prompted the 

body’s 
first-known 
Ethics 

Committee investigation, which 
resulted in a recommendation 
not 
to 
take 
disciplinary 

measures against Arm.

The Michigan Daily reported 

Monday that the full CSG 
assembly would need approve 
the 
ethics 
commission’s 

recommendation, 
based 
on 

information provided by Public 
Policy junior Thomas Hislop, 
who chairs the commission. 
However, 
CSG 
officials 

said 
Tuesday 
the 
report’s 

recommendation was actually a 
binding decision, citing the lack 
of historical precedent for this 
kind of investigation.

Hislop read the investigation’s 

full report to the assembly.

Forum touches 
on relatively high 

minority enrollment, 
sensitivity trainings

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

Last month, the University 

aimed 
to 
further 
prompt 

conversation 
on 
campus 

diversity with the launch of a 
weeklong 
Diversity 
Summit 

led 
by 
University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel. 
Tuesday 

night, more than 100 graduate 
students gathered in Rackham 
Auditorium 
to 
extend 
the 

conversation 
by 
discussing 

minority representation among 
graduate students.

According to the University’s 

Office of the Registrar, 13 percent 
of 
newly 
enrolled 
domestic 

master’s students and 19 percent 

of 
newly 
enrolled 
domestic 

doctoral students at Rackham in 
2015 identify as underrepresented 
minorities. There are about 8,358 
students in Rackham, comprising 
approximately half of the total 
graduate 
and 
professional 

students on campus.

Rackham 
Communications 

Director Aileen Kim said the 
University is among the top 
schools in terms of minority 
enrollment 
among 
graduate 

students — it is in the top 12 

schools in the nation for the 
most 
doctorates 
awarded 

African Americans, Hispanic 
Americans, Native Americans 
and Pacific Islanders.

Students sat at approximately 

15 different tables, each with 
a designated facilitator. After 
discussing questions in smaller 
groups, attendees shared their 
ideas with the room.

The two questions: “What are 

the issues or challenges around

SMTD 

students make 

Shakespeare’s play 
accessible for all

By MARIA 

ROBINS-SOMERVILLE

Daily Arts Writer

Identifying 
the 
heart 

of 
William 
Shakespeare’s 

“Henry IV Part 1,” director 
Priscilla Lindsay, professor 
of School 
of Music, 
Theatre 
& Dance, 
said, 
“Power, 
how 
you 

take 
it, 

how 
you 

keep it.”

And 

the 
cast 

advises 
you 
to 

leave your 
thesaurus at home; come to the 
Power Center this weekend to 
hear the clang of swords and see 

ever-shifting power dynamics 
as characters travel from tavern 
to battlefield and back again.

“Henry IV” provides a slice 

of English history, as it tracks 
Prince Hal’s rise to victory 
when the vengeful Hotspur 
challenges his inheritance of 
the throne. I sat down to chat 
with SMTD seniors Robert 
O’Brien and Caleb Foote, who 
play Prince Hal and Hotspur, 
respectively. They shared a 
hope that the 400-year-old play 
would be accessible.

“A lot of people come into 

Shakespeare thinking it’s very 
wordy,” O’Brien said.

“A 
snoozefest?” 
Foote 

interrupted, laughing.

“Like they need a thesaurus 

or something. I want them to 
leave thinking, ‘I understood 
that,’ ” O’Brien said. 

O’Brien 
plays 
Hal, 
the 

rebellious young son of King 
Henry and heir to the throne 
who, despite his noble status, 
chooses to surround himself 
with a lower-class ruffians who 
spend their time imbibing, 
swearing, gambling — causing 
an overall ruckus.

President says mural to stay

Eli Capilouto, the president 

of the University of Kentucky, 
announced in an e-mail to stu-
dents, faculty and staff that the 
university would not remove 
a mural located in Memo-
rial Hall, the Kentucky Kernel 
reported Monday.

The mural, a fresco com-

missioned as part of the New 
Deal’s Public Works of Art 
Project, was completed in 
1934. Painted by Ann Rice 
O’Hanlon, the piece depicts 
Kentucky’s origins, including 
a couple of tableaus that some 
consider to be racist, such as 
an image of Black slaves pick-
ing crops.

Discussion about the mural’s 

removal began after more than 
100 University of Kentucky fac-

ulty members signed an open 
letter calling for an improve-
ment in campus diversity. As 
a result, the mural was briefly 
shrouded, as Capilouto put it 
in his e-mail, “out of respect 
for long-term expressions of 
concern that could no longer go 
unanswered.”

The university’s next steps, 

Capilouto explained, will be to 
make the narratives depicted in 
the mural “more complete.”

“We will place this impor-

tant work of art … in the 
explicit and accurate context of 
the sober realities of our shared 
history and our advancing 
understanding of race, gender, 
ethnicity, and identity,” he 
wrote.

Ball State eliminates student 
fees for extra credit hours
After a decision by its Board 

of Trustees, Ball State University 
will not charge students extra fees 
for graduating after more than the 
usual four-year time limit, the Ball 
State Daily reported Monday.

These fees were previously 

placed on extra credit hours for 
students who had completed 144 
credit hours in more than four 
years without having received a 
degree.

Bernard Hannon, Ball State’s 

treasurer and vice president for 
business affairs, said the now-
eliminated policy was originally 
implemented to “encourage on-
time graduation from resident 
students.”

EMILIE FARRUGIA/DailyLSA 

LSA senior Devin Jones speaks with members of Students Allied for Freedom and Equality about Central Student Government’s decision to take no action against Representative Jesse Arm at the 
CSG meeting at the Michigan Union on Tuesday.

important for the discussion 
and I also don’t want to lose 
some of the words, “Hislop said. 
“The choices we make are very 
specific and important.”

Hislop noted that he reached 

out to both parties, e-mailed 
witnesses and met with Arm as 
well. He said the investigation 
was meant to serve as a dialogue 
with both parties. Regarding 
SAFE, he said the Committee 
considered whether terms like 
hate crime, or violent offense 
applied to the events in question, 
though they ultimately ruled 
they did not.

“It 
was 
an 
emotionally 

charged event,” he said. “Some 
people would describe it as a 
shouting match.”

During the meeting, about 

10 members of the assembly 
commented 
on 
the 
matter, 

representing 
a 
range 
of 

viewpoints, both related to the 
investigation’s process and the 

decision it ultimately reached.

During 
public 
comments, 

LSA sophomore Haleemah Aqel, 
a member of SAFE, spoke out 
against 
the 
recommendation 

and criticized what she deemed 
misrepresentation in the media 
about the events in question.

“I 
respect 
the 
Ethics 

Committee for taking Jesse 
Arm’s 
actions 
seriously,” 

Aqel said. “I don’t approve 
of the report created by the 
Ethics 
Committee 
because 

it diminished his language, 
as well as his intimidating 
behavior used against SAFE. 
Misrepresentations 
that 

were 
made 
in 
the 
report 

matter and have real impact 
and 
implications 
in 
our 

organization.”

Aqel 
said 
there 
was 

miscommunication during the 
ethics investigation as to why 
SAFE was upset. She said the 
organization’s concern was not 
with whether Arm had a right to 
express his feelings publicly, but 
the manner in which he chose to 
do so.

“He had no right to scream 

at and intimidate the people he 
supposedly represents; when 
his speech crosses the line 
of publicly berating student 
claiming that the student isn’t 
serious about peace and assume 
the behavior is OK is an issue,” 
Aqul said. “The reason for the 
wall is to have a dialogue to 
create that space to discuss 
things. Instead of coming to us, 
Jesse yelled at us publicly.”

She added that she thought the 

incident had been taken out of 
context on campus, with the effect 
of preventing further dialogues 
and generating negative stigma 
about SAFE’s purpose.

CSG Rep. David Schafer, a 

LSA junior, said he thought at 
no point during the video did 
Arm engage in dialogue and 
that the word yell would be 
more accurate than spoke in 
describing his actions.

Hislop said he believes the 

video alone can speak for the 
actual event, but stood by what 
was written in the report.

“I want to make it clear that 

you have the right to demonstrate 
and you have the right to have 
your voice heard. I had no choice 
in the matter as to whether the 
media pick this up or words the 
media chose to define you guys 
by,” Hislop said. “I could only 
pick these words, and I hope they 
mean something to you.”

SAFE member Devin Jones, 

an LSA senior, said he did 
not take issue with the ethics 
commission’s decision. Rather, 
he said the broader problem was 
with power dynamics on campus.

Jones said one thing that 

contributes to those dynamics 
is the University’s three courses 
on the Israel/Palestine conflict 
that he said are taught by white 
Jewish males.

“What we were doing on 

Nov 19. — that is one of the only 
times we get to voice our views 
on campus,” Jones said. “Jesse 
centered his voice in it.”

Jones said the CSG Ethics 

Committee has now caused 
SAFE to be further silenced 
on campus by suggesting Arm

Michigan 
and 
professional 

football player and the current 
medical director at a hospital in 
Reno, Nev.

Hackett will remain in office 

until the University finds a 
permanent replacement, which 
Schlissel said will be an asset 
during the search process.

“Interim Director Hackett 

continues to do a great job with 
the department,” Schlissel said. 
“He’s flexible enough to stay on 
as long as necessary to allow us 
to conduct a very thorough and 
broad search for the very best 
person who can do the job — 
and then to stay around to help 
the person we select come on 
board. So all that’s great, and 
that takes the monkey off my 
back in that I don’t have to do 
this in a three-week time frame. 
The longer we have to do this, 
the more thoughtful and better 
job we can do. A typical search 
takes months.”

Schlissel noted that campus 

outreach and input will be 
a large factor of the search 
process. He said he intends 
to meet with a number of 
governing bodies — including 
Central Student Government, 

the Student-Athlete Advisory 
Committee 
and 
the 
Senate 

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University 
Affairs, 
as 
well 

as 
individual 
coaches 
and 

members 
of 
the 
Athletic 

Department’s staff, to evaluate 
what University constituents 
want most out of the new 
director.

While gauging campus needs, 

Schlissel has also begun to 
independently develop a broad 
set of criteria. He is looking 
for “someone who gets the 
cultural aspects” — “a person of 
unquestioned integrity” who is 
capable of both upholding the 
University’s athletic excellence 
while also placing an emphasis 
on the “student” portion of 
“student-athlete.”

“I’m looking for an athletic 

director that sort of gets it, 
that understands that athletics 
is a part of the University,” he 
said. “It’s not separate from 
the University; it exists to help 
build the community here, and 
to represent us, and to keep 
our alumni attached to the 
University, to develop student 
spirit, to give folks who care 
about athletics an outlet to 
either 
participate 
or, 
more 

often, to watch and cheer.

“It has to be a person of 

unquestioned 
integrity,” 
he 

added. “You know, winning is 
important, but it sure isn’t more 
important than operating at a 
highest level of value system 
— and do things really both by 
the rules, but even do things the 
‘Michigan Way’ of really a high 
level, high standards.”

Divestment and rhetoric

Schlissel has articulated his 

hesitance toward divestment 
on several platforms in the last 
week — both via a post on a 
University website and during 
his final fireside chat of the 
semester.

“The irony here is that 

I am a strong proponent of 
sustainability and recognizing 
the 
significance 
of 
global 

climate 
change 
and 
the 

necessity of having a thoughtful 
way to quickly diminish the 
damage we’re doing to the 
environment,” 
he 
said. 
“I 

think where I differ with 
the 
community 
promoting 

divestment 
is 
whether 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

divesting 
will 
do 
anything 

to achieve the goals that we 
share.”

He noted the University’s 

internal 
commitment 
to 

sustainability, 
renewable 

energy 
and 
spearheading 

correlating 
research, 
adding 

that divestment could deter 
such 
efforts 
on 
a 
larger, 

corporate scale.

“The problem I have with a 

divestment approach is, I don’t 
understand how the University 
of 
Michigan 
changing 
its 

investment 
portfolio 
will 

diminish 
the 
release 
of 

greenhouse 
gases 
into 
the 

environment 
or 
promote 

sustainability,” he said.

What he has said in meetings 

with campus groups such as 
Divest and Invest — which 
recently garnered the support 
of the Faculty Senate Assembly 
with 
regard 
to 
endorsing 

University 
divestment 
from 

fossil fuels — is that University 
divestment 
would 
be 
more 

symbolic than impactful.

“I grant, it’s a symbolic action, 

and symbols are important in 
society,” Schlissel said. “But 
I think the situation’s way 
more complicated … the same 
companies, for example, that 
are harvesting coal and taking 
oil and gas from the ground, are 
the same companies that are 
doing research on renewable 
energy and trying to convert as 
quickly as possible away from 
coal toward gas and, ultimately, 
renewables.”

“Those very same companies 

that we would be divesting 

from need investment capital 
to convert from carbon source 
to renewables,” he later added. 
“So where is that going to come 
from if we put them out of 
business? — not that we could 
by Michigan divesting.”

Schlissel 
said 
the 
most 

productive thing for groups 
like Divest and Invest to do is 
not to lobby the University to 
divest, but instead to focus their 
advocacy 
toward 
tightening 

state regulations and laws.

Broadening 
his 
focus 
to 

include not only Divest and 
Invest, but groups such as the 
Students Allied for Freedom 
and Equality — which, as a part 
of the Boycott, Divestment, 
Sanctions 
movement 
calls 

for the University to create a 
committee to consider divesting 
from 
companies 
that 
they 

allege facilitate human rights 
violations in Israel — Schlissel 
noted that overall, divestment 
does not seem to be a feasible 
tool for the University to use.

“The 
endowment 
isn’t 
a 

vehicle for playing out political 
arguments,” Schlissel said. “It’s 
there to support the mission of 
the University, and it’s taken in 
trust from donors.”

Autonomous 
vehicles see rise in 
young drivers 

A study by Michael Sivak 

and Brandon Schoettle of the 
University’s Transportation 
Research Center found that the 
rise in autonomous vehicles may 
also signal a rise in the demand 
for private road transportation 
among 18 to 39-year-olds. 

For over 30 years, the number 

of young adults without driver’s 
licenses has been on the rise. Since 
1983, the percentage of adults with 
driver’s licenses under the age of 
40 has dropped from 93 percent 
to about 83 percent. Among 18 to 
19 year-olds, the drop is from 84 
percent to 66 percent. 

In a press release, Sivak and 

Schoettle said autonomous 
vehicles will cause a 28 percent 
increase in the number of 18 and 
19-year-olds with driver’s licenses. 

“The basic approach in our 

study involves combining all 
reasons for currently not having 
a driver’s license that would no 
longer be applicable with self-
driving vehicles, and calculating 
the new percentage of persons 
who would have access to 
personal transportation with 
self-driving vehicles,” Sivak 
said. Among the reasonsfor not 
having a driver’s license that 
would no longer be applicable 
with autonomous vehicles are 
being too busy to get a license and 
having a disability that prevents 
one from receiving a license. 

Rep. Fred Upton 
condemns Trump’s 
Muslim comments 

Representative Fred Upton 

(R-St. Joseph), a member of the 
House Republican leadership, 
condemned comments by GOP 
presidential candidate Donald 
Trump calling for the complete 
shutdown of Muslim immigration 
into the U.S. on Tuesday, the 
Detroit Free Press reported. 

Upton, who chairs the 

House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, reportedly said 
Trump’s plan was “crazy.”

In an interview with WSJM-

FM Tuesday, Upton said Trump’s 
comments are in direct violation 
of the constitution’s commitment 
to freedom of religion. 

“We have this thing in our 

nation that we’re pretty proud of: 
freedom of religion. What Donald 
Trump said yesterday goes 
against the very principles that 
our founding fathers wrote into 
the Constitution,” he said. 

Upton added that although he 

supports free speech, he finds 
fault with Trump’s comments.

“It doesn’t follow the pattern 

of who America really is and what 
we stand for,” Upton said.

Trump, who has been 

leading polls in the race for 
the Republican presidential 
nomination, drew criticism from 
both Democrats and Republicans 
after his comment on banning all 
Muslim immigration to the US on 
Monday, in wake of last month’s 
Paris attacks and the deadly 
shooting in San Bernadino, both 
linked to individuals with ties to 
radical Islam. 
Man imprisoned 
for selling fake 
Detroit homes 

38-year-old Joseph Haden of 

Florida will serve four years in 
prison for orchestrating an $18 
million dollar scam in which 
hundreds nationwide were 
tricked into purchasing homes 
in Detroit that did not exist, the 
Detroit Free Press reports. 

U.S. District Judge Stephen 

Murphy sentenced Haden to 
52 months in prison for his role 
in the scheme that cheated 290 
people in 47 states and Canada. 

According to the U.S. 

Attorney’s office, telemarketers 
involved in the scheme claimed 
bank-owned homes in Detroit 
could be purchased for a fraction 
of their value, and that the homes 
could be quickly resold to an 
already-existing group of hedge 
funds and foreign investors. The 
telemarketers would then pocket 
the money.

Medical School in 1977 and 
gained prominence as the first 
surgeon to successfully separate 
conjoined twins in 1987.

In 
addition 
to 
being 
a 

University alum, he has strong 
roots in the state — he was 
born and raised in Detroit, and 
launched his campaign earlier 
this year in the city.

Currently fourth in the polls 

at 13.8 percent, according to 
Real Clear Politics, Carson has 

drawn controversy in recent 
months over statements on 
a variety of issues, including 
gun policy and whether a 
Muslim can be president.

The main focus of the Carson 

campaign’s Wednesday stop 
in the state are two campaign 
events, one open to the public 
and one private.

Carson is slated to hold a 

public town hall at 2:30 p.m. at 
Eastern Michigan University 
to announce a new health 
care plan aimed at providing 
a policy alternative to the 
Affordable Care Act. He is also 

scheduled to attend a campaign 
fundraiser at the Ann Arbor-
Ypsilanti Marriott hotel.

Carson also visited the state 

in September to speak at Spring 
Arbor 
University. 
During 

his speech, he touched on a 
number of social issues as well 
as the importance of education, 
emphasizing the transformative 
nature of education.

A significant portion of the 

current GOP field — including 
frontrunner candidate Donald 
Trump and other candidates at 
the top of the polls — has also 
visited Michigan in past months.

diversity, equity and inclusion that 
affect you as a graduate student?” 
and “What are your short-term and 
long-term ideas for change?”

Rackham 
student 
Kimberly 

Reyes emphasized that change 
does not depend on representation 
and numbers alone. She said 
change in classroom culture and 
conversation are also essential to 
combating such issues.

“When 
you 
say 
you’re 

celebrating diversity, it’s much 
more about bodies in a room 
versus how do faculty create 
places where folks can have 
honest conversations and how 
does 
curriculum 
adequately 

represent issues of oppression, 
even in sciences,” Reyes said. “It’s 
not getting at the kind of academic 
culture and the academic norms 
that I think affect us as graduate 
students much more because our 
departments are our worlds.”

Many students in attendance 

agreed with Reyes, saying they 
have noticed a general lack 
of 
diversity 
training 
among 

Rackham faculty and mentors. 
Rackham 
student 
Channing 

Mathews, president of Students 
of Color of Rackham, said much 
of the advocacy and reform 
surrounding 
diversity, 
equity 

and inclusion falls on students 
when it shouldn’t.

“We should not be the ones 

doing it by ourselves,” she said. 
“We should see the faculty coming 
in and working with us … deans 
allocating resources to address the 
issues that students are coming 

up with. It’s the institution’s 
responsibility to make us know 
that we belong here.”

Mathews expressed the need 

for the University to incentivize 
departments’ 
implementation 

of effective plans for training 
faculty in this respect and 
penalize departments that are 
not doing this work. Schlissel’s 
current 
diversity 
strategy 

calls on individual University 
departments 
and 
units 
to 

develop their own plans for 
approaching 
diversity 
on 

campus, with the hope that 
those plans would then inform a 
broader campus strategy.

“Right now, it feels like the 

University is relying on the 
goodwill of the department,” 
Mathews said.

Rackham Dean Carol Fierke 

explained that because Rackham 
is an umbrella program to many 
different 
departments, 
it 
is 

difficult to change individual 
programs’ 
policies. 
Rackham 

currently provides funding and 
opportunities for workshops and 
training to support inter-program 
diversity efforts. However, none 
are mandatory.

“Those are two areas where we 

have programs,” Fierke said. “It’s 
a matter of figuring out how to 
use them better.”

Mathews said she hoped the 

dialogue from the event would 
result in action.

“I think there’s something 

to be said about having the 
conversation and then moving 
to 
action 
steps,” 
she 
said. 

“Hopefully 
Rackham 
takes 

the dialogue and turns it into 
tangible action steps that came 
from the voices of the students.”

should go unpunished.

“When 
their 
narrative 
is 

beaten away, what do we find? 
We were silenced again — by a 
CSG member,” Jones said. “By 
not helping us, you have helped 
to 
further 
silence 
students 

already in a climate that silences 
their narratives.”

Hislop said he thought the 

event had also highlighted the 
need to revisit how the body 
dealt with ethics among its 
members.

“It basically looked like they 

needed an ethics committee, 
they made three rules for it and 
threw it up there,” Hislop said. 
“I think it’s time we dust it off.”

In 
comments 
to 
the 

commission, Arm said he had 
been through a lot in the last 
couple of weeks and felt the 
proceedings 
have 
detracted 

from his goals at CSG.

“The reasons that I ran for this 

assembly are because I wanted to 
work on mental health programs 
improved on campus, I wanted 
to see sexual assault prevention 
programs 
on 
campus,” 
Arm 

said. “I didn’t run to have ‘Jew’ 
slapped on my back. I didn’t 
run for the assembly to be an 
advocate for Israel.

“My goals and things that 

I want to accomplish in this 
assembly are not related to my 
status as a Jewish student,” 

Arm said. “I’m Jesse. I’m not 
Jesse the Jew, I’m not Jesse 
pro-Israel, I’m Jesse who wants 
to see a better campus for the 
University of Michigan.”

Executive communications

CSG 
President 
Cooper 

Charlton, 
an 
LSA 
senior, 

addressed his recent meeting 
with University President Mark 
Schlissel 
Monday 
to 
discuss 

future initiatives on how to 
increase student voice on campus.

In particular, he said last 

month’s Diversity Summit was 
a learning experience about 
how to start legitimizing the 
platforms from which students 
can voice their opinions. 

“I want to pause here and say we 

made it aware of an easy fix is that 
we host these feedback sessions at 
times where students can actually 
show up,” Charlton said.

Charlton said it was noted 

during the main assembly’s 
9 a.m. start time limited the 
number 
of 
students 
would 

would attend.

“We wanted to make it clear 

that when students voice their 
opinions it can make it all the 
way up to the top and not lost 
along the way,” he said.

Other initiatives discussed 

were the renovations at the 
University’s 
unions, 
which 

Charlton said he hopes to be a 
restorative space for students on 
campus, as well as the release of 
course evaluations and student 
safety.

The ungiftable mother

S

ince before I was born, when 
it was only my sisters in the 
house, my mom has always 

asked for peace 
and 
harmony 

every 
year 
for 

Christmas. This 
year we got her a 
Crock-Pot. 

I screw up gifts 

for my mom all 
the time. It start-
ed in the second 
grade, when my 
teacher assigned 
us each the proj-
ect 
of 
picking 

out gifts for our parents from a box 
of festive trinkets. She’d ordered the 
box from Oriental Trading. She sent 
us home with a worksheet with spac-
es for what our family wanted. On it 
were question prompts, in case we 
blanked during the interview.

“Mother, what is your favorite 

color?” I had to ask.

It seemed silly. I thought I already 

knew all there was to know about the 
strange people who lived in my house 
and enforced my bedtime, which 
wasn’t much. I’m not sure it occurred 
to me they could have opinions and 
desires that were not directly related 
to my person and well-being.

“Yellow,” my mother said. “I love 

yellow. Now put on your cleats for soc-
cer practice and no crying this time.”

So I brought her home a little 

yellow ornament for the tree. And 
that was all the getting-to-know-you 
I did with my mother for a very long 
time, until a Christmas in middle 
school when I bought her a yellow 
sweater. I had asked her what she 
wanted but she’d just said “peace and 
harmony,” per usual.

She just loved the sweater, “really, 

I do,” she said. Except she didn’t. 
One of the many reasons giving and 
getting gifts is a terrible and fright-
ening institution is because of the 
expressions we have to make while 
we open them. Most everyone knows 
when someone really loves a gift, or 
if they’re just making the face you’re 
supposed to make when you unwrap 
it. “Oh, I just love it!” they’ll say, tuck-
ing it away in a drawer and quickly 
patting the handle. 

A few weeks later, my mother 

was walking around the house in a 
sweater almost exactly like the one 
I got her, except it was periwinkle 

blue. I figured she’d exchanged it, 
which would be fine. But she hadn’t. 
She’d kept the sweater I’d gotten her 
— she’d never give that away, it was 
a gift from her son. She just wanted 
one in blue, because after all, “Blue is 
just my favorite color,” she said.

It was enough that my parents were 

allowed to have ideas and opinions not 
directly related to me. But to go about 
changing all the time and acting like 
real, living people was another matter. 
I’d put in the quality time in the second 
grade, and from then, my relationship 
with the people who lived in my house 
and enforced my bedtime should have 
been coasting.

That 
night, 
or 
some 
night 

thereafter, my sisters and I gathered 
sub rosa to discuss the matter of our 
mother, who was impossible to pick 
out gifts for. I quickly suggested she 
should be eliminated. “If she were in 
a coma,” I said, “we would only have 
to visit once a year with flowers, like 
they do on TV.”

My sisters and I weighed the rela-

tive emotional cost of having a moth-
er in a coma or admitting to ourselves 
that perhaps we didn’t know our 
mother as a person the way we 
assumed we always had. After some 
deliberation, it was decided that 
measure was too drastic, but it was 
put on the backburner as a last resort.

We decided the easiest way to pick 

out gifts was to determine what our 
mother liked to do.

“Cooking,” 
my 

sisters 
said, 
“and 

cleaning.”

“Yes 
… 
Good, 

good. 
But 
what 

about laundry?” I 
asked.

It was decided 

that, in lieu of rub-
ber gloves and laun-
dry detergent, for the next Mother’s 
Day we’d save up the money, go to the 
Home Depot and buy all the fixings 
for my mom to start her own garden. 
It just seemed like the sort of thing 
that the sort of person who seemed 
to like to cook and clean and wash 
dishes and pick up children’s rooms 
would like to do — gardening, I 
mean. I’d find out years later that my 
mom had other interests that didn’t 
involve caring for us, that she likes 
snowshoeing and tennis and appar-
ently used to work for Microsoft, 
whatever that was or meant.

So that May, we plopped a few 

stacks of wood and some nails and 
seeds in the yard with a bow on all of 
it. Then we patted each other on the 
back and left our mother to construct 
it, because there was a daytime 
marathon of Lifetime original movies 
on and the weather was just awful.

My mom actually did like that gift. 

I think she would have spent a lot of 
time in the garden had she any time 
to spare, between driving us to and 
from sports and doing the cooking 
and cleaning and the laundry that 
she seemed to love so much.

So the garden never got built, 

and I think I felt a pang of grief, or 
annoyance. I just really thought 
I’d finally gotten her, bought her 
off with a garden. It wouldn’t have 
mattered what it was. It could have 
been a Prada bag, a Lamborghini, a 
whole circus in the goddamn back 
yard. Just so long as I could say that 
I’d done it: I’d bought you out and you 
had never really wanted peace and 
harmony, you had wanted…

But no. It struck me that the woman 

who lived in my house and enforced 
my bedtime wanted nothing from me. 
She had done all she’d done out of love, 
a great insurmountable love that I was 
ashamed I couldn’t understand, and 
that I could do nothing in my whole 
life to repay her. 

Anyways, my sisters and I have 

changed the gift plans a little bit. In 
addition to the Crock-Pot, we got 

her some Crock-Pot 
cooking lessons. I 
think that’s a nice 
little 
addition, 

because we spent a 
little more, maybe.

But the idea of 

my mother standing 
in a cooking class 
with a few people 

she did not know, being taught to 
cook for her family using a Crock-
Pot-brand crock-pot, hit me in the 
stomach like a ton of bricks. So if all 
13 of my readers can keep a secret, 
I’ll tell you that my sisters and I 
bought the same lessons my mom 
is going to, and my dad is coming, 
too, and maybe, after a little more 
quality time spent with her, a few 
years down the road, I’ll find out 
what she’s really wanted all along.

The Holy Starbucks

O

n 
a 
freezing 
Sunday 

morning, we made our way 
up the narrow staircase to 

the second floor 
of Literati where 
The Espresso Bar 
is located. We 
were 
prepared 

for an evening of 
finals 
studying 

with some much 
needed caffeine 
involved. 
However, 
once 

we reached the 
top, 
we 
were 

surprised to find 
that there were zero tables open. So 
with a look and shrug, we trudged 
down to the street, looking up more 
coffee shops near our location on 
our way out.

We then proceeded to travel to 

three different coffee shops that 
Siri promised were within walking 
distance. The first one was full, the 
second one had an “off” sort of feeling 
and smelled like the music store where 
I used to take lessons, and the third 
one actually didn’t exist because we 
were apparently staring right at the 
shop when all we could see was an 
empty brick wall. (Potentially there’s a 
Diagon Alley sort of thing going on; I’ll 
investigate later.)

The point is, we spent the better 

part of a half hour looking for a new 
coffee shop to study at for a change of 
scenery before eventually just settling 
on our usual venue — Starbucks. So 
can anybody tell me why we wasted 
so much time scouring the city, hell-
bent on studying in a coffee shop when 
there are dozens of options Ann Arbor 
and the University have to offer?

If you asked me on a normal day 

why so many college students flock to 
coffee shops like they’re Noah’s Ark, 
I’d probably tell you it was because of 
the caffeine. The revered coffee, or the 
“Holy Starbucks” as I have affection-
ately coined it, keeps us running late 
at night, promising us that yes, we will 
in fact finish this paper before its mid-
night submission deadline.

I have a strange relationship with 

coffee. The smell of the fresh grounds 
at Meijer always drew my head, but 
when my dad let me try my first 
coffee during my sophomore year 

of high school, I pretended to like it 
even though it was probably the most 
disgusting thing I had ever tasted. 
(Disclaimer: It was probably some 
kind of caramel latte that I would find 
too sugary today. What can I say? I was 
young and innocent.)

So, in preparing to begin my 

journey as a college student, I was 
suddenly assaulted with birthday, 
graduation and “thinking of you” 
cards stuffed with Starbucks gift 
cards. I was confused — my family and 
friends know that I don’t drink coffee, 
so why are they sending me these? On 
possibly the seventh Starbucks gift 
card, I finally spoke up.

“You know I hate coffee. Why are 

you giving me a Starbucks card?”

My friend was confused at my 

question: “Oh, you know. Because 
you’re going to college soon and 
you’ll need it.”

At the time, I thought that maybe 

this was a good thing. I’d finally like 
coffee, which would make me more 
mature, right? And thus began my 
coffee 
journey. 
I 

started 
off 
small, 

taking on the decked 
out frappuccinos first 
before moving on to 
lattes. 
Eventually, 

I was drinking a 
caramel macchiato, 
which makes you feel 
more like an adult 
rather than a high 
school teenager snapping selfies with 
her “créme frapp” (fun fact: those 
don’t actually have coffee in them even 
though they’re delicious; I learned the 
hard way).

So I naturally became a bit of a 

coffee addict, drinking it as both a 
means to drag myself out of bed in the 
morning and to stay up on nights that 
the work never seemed to end. We’re 
all a bit of a mess, though, aren’t we?

Surprisingly enough, most days 

that I find myself sitting in the 
Michigan Union Starbucks, I stay for 
the ambiance: the warm glow of the 
chandeliers, the Christmas music 
filtering through the speakers and 
the smell of freshly brewed coffee. I 
go with friends and walk away with 
homework assignments completed 
— it’s a beautiful cycle that’s backed 
up by research.

According to a study led by Ravi 

Mehta, a business administration 
professor at the University of Illinois, 
“Modest background noise creates 
enough of a distraction to encourage 
people to think more imaginatively.”

So the ambiance in your local coffee 

shop isn’t only great for your mind, but 
for your work as well. The research 
actually suggests that “walking out 
of one’s comfort zone and getting into 
a relatively noisy environment may 
trigger the brain to think abstractly, 
and thus generate creative ideas.”

Even though we’re packing coffee 

shops for a much-needed caffeine fix, 
we’re actually doing our studies some 
good in the process.

In an article in The Atlantic, Conor 

Friedersdorf suggests that research 
shows some people are motivated 
to get more done in coffee shops 
due to social pressures; we are more 
likely to get work done in public in 
order to present ourselves as having 
a purpose to be there. And I mean, 
who hasn’t used that as a motivation 

before? 
Working 

on 
research 
at 

Starbucks 
while 

watching 
other 

students becoming 
distracted by the 
pull 
of 
Facebook 

notifications, 
I 

have 
felt 
like 
I 

was 
the 
“good” 

student 
who 
was 

constantly doing my work without 
checking Facebook. Whereas in 
my room, I would oftentimes find 
myself changing songs on YouTube 
or 8Tracks and becoming distracted 
finding something to listen to, which 
negatively impacted my learning in 
the long run. There was no pressure 
to keep doing work.

Even if you feel like you’re not 

getting much done, I think you’ll be 
surprised realizing how much work 
you actually accomplished during 
your time at the “Holy Starbucks.” 
That, and you’ll get a pretty sweet 
coffee fix out of it.

So go and enjoy your peppermint 

mocha frappuccino, you beautiful 
mess, you.

A

mericans have a lot of practice 
nowadays with mass shootings. On 
television, journalists launch into 

hours 
of 
investigative 

coverage for a few days 
following 
a 
shooting, 

introducing a new graphic 
for 
each 
and 
every 

development, 
regardless 

of its relevancy. Moments 
of silence at large sporting 
events seem to happen 
with increasing frequency. 
Social media quickly fills 
up with prayers for the 
family of the victims, 
copied, pasted and shared 
by thousands.

And then we move on, ready for the 
 

next tragedy.

Unsurprisingly, one group that did not 

exactly have its act together in response to the 
shootings in San Bernardino last Wednesday 
was the usually dysfunctional leadership of 
the Republican Party. Republican presidential 
candidate Carly Fiorina called for better 
enforcement of “the laws that we have” 
and criticized President Barack Obama and 
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary 
Clinton for politicizing the issue. In an 
effort to combine the inappropriate with the 
asinine, Republican presidential candidate 
Ted Cruz unveiled the Second Amendment 
Coalition at an Iowa gun range two days after 
the shooting. 

The 
only 
commonality 

between the positions of 
GOP 
politicians 
was 
the 

categorical agreement that 
guns are not the problem, 
but instead mental illness is. 
Speaker of the House Paul 
Ryan (R–Wis.) took to “CBS 
This Morning” to explain 
that “people with mental 
illness are getting guns and 
committing these mass shootings,” and to 
announce that Congress is already drafting 
legislation dealing with the root cause of 
these shootings: mental health.

With 14 dead and 21 injured, with families 

still grieving, with an FBI investigation into 
whether the shooting was linked to terrorism 
ongoing, the GOP’s decision to go on the 
offensive by linking mental illness to mass 
shootings is insensitive, uninformed and 
irresponsible. For starters, the notion that 
tragedies like the one in San Bernardino are 
direct results of mental illness is tenuous at best. 
A 2014 study from the American Psychological 
Association showed that of crimes committed 
by people with serious mental disorders, just 
7.5 percent were directly related to symptoms 
of mental illness. Dylann Roof was not mentally 
ill in Charleston, nor was Robert Lewis Dear 
when he took the lives of three people at a 
Planned Parenthood in Colorado.

Dr. Liza Gold, a clinical professor of 

psychiatry at Georgetown Medical Center, 
has attempted to debunk these myths in her 
book released last month, “Gun Violence and 
Mental Illness.”

“Most people with serious mental illness 

are not violent,” Gold wrote, and “most violent 
individuals do not have serious mental illness 
and evidence indicates that individuals with 
serious mental illness who kill strangers with 
a gun is one of the rarest types of gun violence 
in the United States.”

A threat assessment team that has been 

working in Salem, Ore., for the past 15 years 
notes that mental illness is often not to blame 
for violence. “It’s easy to want to say they’re 
mentally ill, they’re different from us,” said 
Allan Rainwater, a mental health investigator 
for Marion Country, “and quite often, they 
may not be.” 

Americans saw this after Sandy Hook, and 

with the 1,044 mass shootings (yes, 1,044) 
since then. Journalists attempted to explain 
the shooter’s behavior, guessing that he 
was an undiagnosed schizophrenic. But the 
simple fact of the matter is that there’s no 
real empirical evidence that suggests mass 
shootings stem directly from the mentally ill. 
This isn’t to say that such a connection never 
exists, simply that Speaker Ryan introducing 
this legislation as a solution to the problem 
is misguided and furthers an unfounded 
narrative among U.S. citizens.

There’s no evidence that the shooters in 

San Bernardino were mentally ill. Yet the 
knee-jerk reaction of GOP politicians con-
tinues to point to psychological disorders. 
It seems the old adage of gun owners in the 
United States has been updated to “guns don’t 
kill people, crazy people kill people.”

As British comedian Eddie Izzard once 

said, though, I think the 
 

gun helps. 

Last Wednesday’s tragedy 

marks the 355th mass shooting 
of the year. Syed Rizwan 
Farook and Tashfeen Malik 
bought assault rifles and semi-
automatic handguns, loaded 
them, dropped their baby off 
their with grandma, drove to 
a holiday party and, until they 

pulled the trigger, had yet to commit a crime. 
More than 80 percent of guns used in mass 
shootings in the United States are purchased 
legally. That’s something Americans have to 
confront. And the conversation on mental 
health is a distraction.

Even if mental health was found to be a 

cause of mass shootings, what then would be 
the end goal? Would it be our goal to eradicate 
mental illness? At the rate of civilian deaths 
in the United States today, I sincerely doubt 
we can afford to wait for the years of institu-
tional reforms and mental health counseling 
that might not even solve the problem.

Evidence shows that the No. 1 Republican 

response to mass shootings is somewhere 
between doubtful and blatantly ignorant. 
Their goal is to deny any notion that there is 
a gun problem in the United States, instead 
peddling the idea that somehow Americans 
are more prone to mental illness and violence. 
This year, 462 people have been killed in mass 
shootings, with 1,314 injuries across 47 states.

Wednesday, December 9, 2015 — 5A

Although the setting of the 

play has not been tampered 
with, the cast and crew have 
taken 
some 
liberties 
with 

the production. Lindsay, the 
director, decided to keep the 
play in its original 15th century 
time period.

“I’ve managed to work a 

number of women into the 
show,” she said. “One of the 
big things we did was change 
the Duke of Worcester to the 
Duchess 
of 
Worcester. 
She 

takes no prisoners.”

Aside from a minor cut or two, 

the script has not been seriously 
abridged. The physical nature 
of the play allows it to move 
along quickly and dynamically.

“Something quite unique to this 

production is the amount of stage 
combat there is — a lot of work 
with weaponry,” O’Brien said.

“Something that a lot of us 

have to do is keep up with our 
condition physically because 
we’re running through these 
massive fights, and after the 
fights, 
we’re 
expected 
to 

continue these huge pieces of 
text while trying to connect 

those into the breath,” Foote 
explained. 

“It’s physical. It’s cerebral. 

It’s really a test to everything 
that we’ve got,” O’Brien said.

The timelessness of “Henry 

IV” has energized the cast, 
as they move beyond parsing 
the 
complex 
language 
and 

logistical decisions to a place 
of creativity and playfulness 
in more boisterous comedic 
moments that balance the play’s 
historical gravity.

“We’ve crossed a threshold 

of learning the technicalities 
and learning lines and all of 
that stuff, and now we’re just 
all together having a blast 
on stage — you can’t let that 
drop. Feeling that has been the 
most invigorating part of the 
process,” O’Brien said. 

Doing a play filled with stage 

combat has provided a space for 
deep exploration of swordplay, 
which 
characterizes 
period-

specific violence.

“If you were to put it into 

modern day and someone were 
to pull out a gun and blame 
somebody, the scene’s over,” 
said Lindsay.

Fight director Robert Najarian 

has worked closely with the 
cast on crafting complicated 

moments of combat.

“There’s been a wide variety 

of physical confrontations in 
this play, from robberies to little 
tussles in the tavern to mass 
battles,” he said. “Shakespeare 
provides such a breadth of 
experience, 
especially 
with 

moments of violence.”

The 
production 
seeks 
to 

explore universal themes and 
questions 
on 
stage, 
which 

audiences can relate to despite 
a multi-century gap.

“What is leadership? What 

is honor? What makes a good 
leader?” said Lindsay, referring 
to 
the 
questions 
the 
play 

considers.

“It’s going to be relevant 

because the issues are still the 
same. It’s all about power. It’s 
all about the struggle between 
fathers and sons,” she said. 

The 
central 
father-son 

dynamic of the play is between 
King Henry, played by SMTD 
senior Matt Provenza.

“The father-son conflict I 

think applies to college-aged 
men and women, now more 
than in any other part of our 
lives,” said Provenza.

Beyond depiction of English 

history and struggle for power, 
“Henry IV” is a coming-of-age 

story that questions character 
agency over identity. 

“Something I really want the 

audience to come away from 
this with is man’s propensity 
to change. I want people to see 
that anyone can come around,” 
Provenza said. “It is possible to 
assume a new person at some 
point in your life and be the 
person you’ve always wanted to 
be or perhaps fulfill a destiny 
that is perhaps better than the 
one you’re living now.”

The fancy swordplay and 

elegant language is more than 
a depiction of physical grace or 
impressive intellect; it intends 
to provide the audience with a 
context for the violence.

“I do want people to be 

thrilled 
by 
what 
they 
see 

on stage, but at the same 
time know that all of this 
hopefully thrilling stuff has 
consequences,” Najarian said. 
“We’re not just doing this to 
be like, ‘Hey it’s fun to play 
with swords,’ but show that, 
when you are violent towards 
people, there are consequences 
to relationships that were once 
awesome and then fail.”

“You’re Oscar-worthy, Katifer Lawdeen!”
Art imitates life: 
J-Law & Katniss

Lawrence takes 

cues from ‘Hunger 
Games’ alter-ego

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

For The Daily

As an impressionable high 

school freshman, I fell into the 
trap of reading whatever my 
classmates were raving about. 
So, of course, I found myself 
lounging on a beach chair with 
a copy of “The Hunger Games” 
during the summer of 2012. 
When my friends asked how 
much I loved the novel, I didn’t 
want to ruin their excitement, 
so I gave it a solid 10 out of 10. 
Honestly, though, it was only a 
6.5 in my mind.

What fell flat for me in the 

first novel and only proceeded 
to get worse in the other two 
was that I couldn’t connect 
with the characters, especially 
Katniss – she never seemed real 
enough. After the film franchise 
was announced, I was hopeful 
that Jennifer Lawrence would 
bring the character to life. But. 
I couldn’t stand Katniss in “The 
Hunger Games,” “Catching Fire” 
or even “Mockingjay - Part 1.” But 
then came “Mockingjay - Part 2,” 
and I’m still in awe of Lawrence’s 
performance.

I saw “Part 2” three weeks ago 

and up until recently, I was still 

processing why I felt that Katniss 
suddenly became so real. After a 
lecture in film class on effective 
acting, I finally realized that in 
the previous films, it felt like 
Lawrence was just playing the 
role of Katniss, but in “Part 2, ” 
Katniss becomes an extension of 
Lawrence herself.

Up until 2015, Lawrence has 

refrained from publicly sharing 
her opinions on feminism. In 
October, she broke her silence 
by publishing a Lenny Letter 
(a feminist newsletter curated 
by Lena Dunham and Jenni 
Konner), where she outlined her 
experience with unequal pay 
as a woman in the Hollywood 
film industry. She writes about 
how even though she was met 
with backlash, she still didn’t 
back down. Similarly, Katniss is 
often met with resistance from 
Gale, but she either ignores his 
criticisms or calls him out on his 
own questionable choices. 

Speaking 
of 
Gale, 
while 

“Hunger 
Games” 
is 
not 
as 

dependent on the love triangle as 
“Twilight,” romance is definitely 
a dominant theme. In “Part 
2,” the boy-drama is diluted, 
as Katniss keenly focuses on 
eliminating President Snow and 
improving life for the citizens 
of Panem. As she tries to sleep 
in the tunnels, she overhears 
Gale and Peeta discussing their 
relationships with her. Instead 
of intently trying to listen in, she 
closes her eyes and it quickly cuts 
to the next scene.

Similarly, 
Lawrence 
didn’t 

let Chris Martin’s (a former 
boyfriend) indecision over her 
and his ex-wife distract her from 
executing a potentially Oscar-
worthy 
performance. 
Though 

Katniss often disregards the 
words of her advisors, it would 
almost be more fitting to title the 
film “Mission Impossible: Rogue 
Katniss.” Most of her actions 
are calculated risks; she usually 

doesn’t take them unless the odds 
are more in her favor than not.

This sudden surge of ambition 

can once again be attributed to 
Lawrence’s personality. Earlier 
this month, during a promotional 
tour for “Mockingjay - Part 2,” 
Lawrence officially announced 
that she’d like to be a director. 
Her first potential film, “Project 
Delirium,” is not seen by many as 
“her type of film.” The movie is 
said to adapt a New Yorker story 
about James Ketchum, the retired 
psychiatrist and U.S. army colonel 
and his involvement with a secret 
LSD experimentation program. 
If this project is picked up by a 
producer, Lawrence has made it 
clear that she will only direct, and 
not star, in it. 

Saving 
her 
best 
Katniss 

performance for last, Lawrence 
gives 
dissatisfied 
readers 
an 

impressive conclusion to the 
series. Unfortunately, this is the 
last time we’ll ever see Katniss 
and Lawrence in harmony. Or, 
more cleverly, Jeniss Everence or 
Katifer Lawdeen (still trying to 
decide which one is better).

“Finally, Kimmi -- we’re in print!”
‘Supernatural’ Recap: 
‘Just My Imagination’

By KIM BATCHELOR

Daily Arts Writer

Having played one of the most 

ridiculous and imaginative char-
acters on the show (Gabriel/The 
Trickster), I imagine that Richard 
Speight Jr. (“To Appomattox”) felt 
right at home directing the eighth 
episode. “Just My Imagination” 
approaches the Pixar-esque with 
its glimpse into the world of chil-
dren’s’ imaginary friends.

The episode opens with a young 

girl named Maddie (Jena Skodje, 
“R.L. Stine’s The Haunting Hour”) 
having a tea party with her imagi-
nary friend, Sparkle (Everrett 
Shea, “Arrow”). Things quickly 
take a dark turn when Maddie 
leaves to go to dinner with her par-
ents. While she is gone, Sparkle is 
brutally stabbed to death.

In the bunker, Sam (Jared 

Padalecki, “Gilmore Girls”) wakes 
up and heads down the hall to 
make coffee, all the while being 
stalked by a mysterious shadow. 
Surprise! The shadow turns out 
to be Sully (Nate Torrence, “Hello 
Ladies”), Sam’s imaginary friend 
from childhood, he only realizes 
after instinctually punching Sully. 
Dean (Jensen Ackles, “Smallville”) 
arrives at the sound of commo-
tion but, since Dean can’t see Sully 
unless Sully wants him too, he is 
naturally concerned about Sam’s 
mental health. And when Sully 
does reveal himself, Dean is just 
concerned in general. Sully has to 
explain quickly that he’s a species 
called Zanna and that he came to 
the brothers for help because his 
friend was murdered.

Dean hesitates to help Sully 

because he doesn’t trust him, 
believing he may be evil. But Sam 
believes that Sully is truly his old 
imaginary friend from when he 
was a child, and there is lore on 
Zanna in the Romanian books 
to back up his story. Sam feels 
he owes Sully and needs to help 
him as a repayment for Sully’s 
help during his childhood. Dean 
doesn’t understand why Sam 
even needed an imaginary friend 
to begin with. Sam explains it’s 
because he was lonely. In a flash-
back, we come to understand how 
a young Sam (Dylan Kingwell, 
“The Returned”) felt left behind 

by Dean (Dylan Everett, “Open 
Heart”) and his father when it 
came time to go on hunts. We’re 
also treated to a new actor for a 
young Sam and the return of fan 
favorite Dylan Everett.

Sam, Dean and an invisible 

Sully visit the home of Sparkle’s 
child under the guise of trauma 
counselors. Mrs. Berman (Carrie 
Genzel, “Under One Roof”), Mad-
die’s mother, explains that Mad-
die won’t return to her room. Sam 
and Dean ask Maddie why she 
won’t go back. The answer: “All 
of the blood.” Once they reach the 
room, Sully appears to let them 
see the murder scene. Unfortu-
nately, it means they get to wit-
ness the truly horrifying scene to 
follow wherein Mrs. Berman acci-
dentally gets Sparkle’s blood all 
over her face. If the actress who 
plays Sparkle looks familiar, it’s 
because she was on the show ten 
years earlier in the Season One 
episode “Bugs.”

Elsewhere, a Zanna mermaid 

named Nicky (Ida Segerhagen, 
“Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce”) is 
stabbed in a pool while her child 
is at gymnastics. Sully learns of 
the murder through a Zanna-spe-
cific telepathic link, and the three 
arrive on the scene of Nicky’s 
murder. Sully mentions Nicky 
has a boyfriend and Dean decides 
they ought to question him after 
they bury her body. While they 
dig her grave, Sam remembers 
a time when he considered run-
ning away from the hunter life as 
a young boy and Sully supported 
him. Sully reminded Sam that he 
could go to school if he wanted, 
that he could be whatever he 
wanted to be.

Weems 
(Eduard 
Witzke, 

“What’s Up Warthogs!”), Nicky’s 
Zanna boyfriend, is out in the 
backyard of the house of the child 
he’s attached to, hanging up the 
laundry to dry, when he’s attacked 
by the murderer. He’s stabbed 
and left bleeding and calling out 
telepathically for Sully while the 
assailant drives off. Sam, Dean 
and Sully find Weems and patch 
up his wound while they explain 
the situation. Weems informs 
them that the murderer is female 
and drives a Volkswagon Bug. 
After Weems treats him to the 

coolest air guitar solo ever, Dean 
chases the car.

Weems is surprised to hear 

that Sam and Sully are back 
together because Sam “broke his 
heart.” It really hurt Sully when 
Sam decided to stay a hunter 
rather than run away with him 
— when he told Sully that he 
didn’t need him anymore. Sam 
apologizes to Sully for the way 
they ended things. Sully admits 
that when Sam went off to hunt 
he considered it a failure on his 
part, but he also admits that he 
was wrong. He’s proud of Sam 
and the person he has become. 
Sam discloses that he’s the reason 
the Darkness was set free, and he 
thinks that the answer to how to 
stop it may lie in the cage with 
Lucifer. Sam’s scared. He is scared 
to go back there. Sully asks if Sam 
ever thinks about running away 
anymore. Sam says not anymore.

Sam gets a text from Dean tell-

ing them that he has found the 
killer. But, in fact, it’s the opposite: 
the killer has found him. When 
Sam and Sully arrive, Sully is 
shocked to see Reese (Anja Savcic, 
“Strange 
Empire”), 
a 
young 

woman he knew as a child. Sully 
was Reese’s imaginary friend, but 
also the imaginary friend of her 
sister Aubrey. Since she followed 
him out into the street and was 
hit by a car, Reese blames Sully for 
Aubrey’s death. Furthermore, she 
blames him for disappearing after 
it and leaving her all alone.

Dean talks her down. He 

explains that revenge won’t make 
her feel better. He promises that 
Sully isn’t a monster because 
when he wasn’t able to be there 
for Sam, Sully was. After Reese 
calms down and heads home, Sam 
and Sully say their goodbyes. Sully 
still knows just the right thing to 
say to encourage Sam to come to 
the correct decision and reminds 
him that sometimes the heroes 
are heroes just because there is no 
one else who will do what is right.

As Sam and Dean drive home, 

Sam brings up the idea of him vis-
iting the cage once more. Dean 
shoots him down, promising, 
“there’s always another way.” 
But Sam wants to know what that 
other way is, and Dean doesn’t 
have an answer.

TV REVIEW
‘Real Rob’ a real 
flop for Netflix

Rob Schneider is 
probably the only 
person watching

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Comedian Rob Schneider must 

think his life is incredibly fasci-
nating. The failings of his 2012 
CBS 
comedy 

“Rob” evidently 
weren’t enough 
to deter Schnei-
der 
(“Deuce 

Bigalow: Male 
Gigolo”) 
from 

making a sec-
ond attempt at 
documenting 
his celebrity life, as he produced 
a new series to showcase his 
crude humor and political incor-
rectness. Closely based on real-
ity, “Real Rob” is a comedy so 
dull and stilted that the only one 
watching is himself.

The 
eight-episode 
Netflix 

series is a self-proclaimed “exag-
geration” of Schneider’s real life 
in Hollywood, and a way for the 
actor-producer to unleash his 
creative expression free from the 
restrictions of network politics. 
According to Deadline.com, the 
low-budget production is mainly 
financed by Schneider as he “puts 
his money where his mouth is.” 
The rest of the crew is made up of 
family and friends, who are also 
working under their regular sala-
ries. Co-producer and wife Patri-
cia Schneider plays herself, but, 
instead of adding authenticity to 
the series, serves her purpose by 
allowing her husband to exploit 
her Mexican descent for comedic 
content. Their daughter Miranda 
makes a silent and unmemorable 
appearance on screen — yet anoth-
er reason the production should 
be viewed solely for the Schneider 
family’s home-video purposes.

Along with a glimpse into 

Rob 
Schneider’s 
family 
life, 

“Real Rob” centers around an 
incompetent assistant, played by 

co-creator Jamie Lissow (“Red 
Eye”), and an ever-present stalk-
er (whose creepy mustache could 
very well be the most entertain-
ing factor of the entire show). The 
anecdotes that are presumably 
drawn from his real life experi-
ence are stilted and surprisingly 
mundane; further dumbed down 
to accommodate the lack of pro-
fessionals on set. Apart from 
Schneider, the cast has minimal 
acting experience, forcing them 
to feed lines to the main star as he 
delivers the final punchline.

The single camera-style com-

edy is interrupted by scenes of 
stand-up, a potentially creative 
way to showcase the abilities 
that landed Schneider his job at 
“Saturday Night Live” in 1988. 
However, the stand-up scenes, 
sprinkled sporadically through-
out, seem to come out of nowhere 
and only tangentially relate to 
the plot in the rest of the episode. 
More often than not, Schneider 
uses his wife’s antics as inspira-
tion for his monologues, depicting 
her as a crazy Latina housewife 
that makes his simple life oh so 
hard. Naturally, Schneider uses a 

mildly offensive Mexican accent 
to drive his point home.

A trend of comedians starring 

in their own productions has been 
on the rise in the past few years. 
Aziz Ansari created “Master of 
None” and Mindy Kaling did the 
same in “The Mindy Project.” 
Such series allow the comedians 
to showcase their sense of humor 
and quirky charisma on screen, 
and they have all received a fairly 
positive response from viewers. 
Schneider’s personality, however, 
does not come off as relatable or 
intriguing in “Real Rob,” as he 
attempts to pull most of his laughs 
from deprecating himself or his 
fellow cast members. The lack of 
emotional attachment between 
the characters on-screen trans-
lates to a lack of connection with 
the viewers, further alienating 
Schneider’s life from a realm of 
genuine interest.

Filled with crude humor and 

uncomfortable jokes, “Real Rob” 
lacks wit, innovation and charm. 
Even in his fictionalized auto-
biography, Schneider can’t find 
a way to make his life’s story 
worth watching.

How ‘Jessica Jones’

Daily Arts Writer

Two weeks ago on a Friday 

evening around 5:30, I sat down 
in the East Quad lobby with 
my computer and a red anti-
Christmas 
Starbucks 
coffee, 

and pressed “play” on the first 
episode of Marvel’s new “Jessica 
Jones.” I was slightly skeptical 
of the premise, intrigued by 
the trailers, and worried that 
people would walk by during 
a sex scene and assume I was 
watching porn in a lobby.

But all of those emotions 

faded away after 30 minutes in. 
(Except the sex scene thing — 
that may have happened.)

A couple hours later, I figured 

I had watched enough for one 
night, so I closed my laptop, 
tossed 
my 
coffee, 
walked 

upstairs to my room, sat on my 
bed, reopened my computer and 
pressed “play” again.

So now having watched the 

entirety of “Jessica Jones” in 
less time than may be considered 
“normal” or “healthy,” I feel 
confident saying that it isn’t 
just Marvel’s best show — like 
I believed after watching the 
first five episodes — but one of 
the best shows of the year.

It’s also one of the most 

feminist shows on TV right now.

We so rarely see female 

superheroes in TV that aren’t 
fighting 
fucktoys 
or 
other 

inherently misogynistic tropes. 
Jessica (Krysten Ritter, “Don’t 
Trust the B—— in Apt. 23” ) 
stomps all over those cliches 
(wearing the same pair of 
jeans almost the entire time, 
I’m 
convinced.) 
The 
show 

destroys not only the idea that 
women can’t be interesting 
superheroes, but that women 
can’t be complex anti-heroes. 
Jessica isn’t always likable; she 
makes selfish decisions and 
often treats the few people 
close to her very rudely. But 
her unlikability isn’t force-fed 
to us, and is coupled with a 
vulnerability that we viscerally 
feel. Though she is complicated, 
none of her complexity is 
contrived.

Half of the show’s strength 

is found in its representation 
of 
the 
abusive 
relationship 

which Kilgrave, the villain, 
(David 
Tennant, 
“Doctor 

Who”) held Jessica captive in 
— a relationship that see only 
through flashbacks and through 
its current effects on her.

For reasons best known to 

himself — though we catch 
glimpses of them when his 
composure 
cracks, 
which 

happens more often as the 
season progresses — Kilgrave 
is 
infatuated 
with 
Jessica. 

Though we see right away how 
scared Jessica is of him, it takes 
the whole season for us to fully 
comprehend their history. It’s 
presented with much more 
nuance than just “emotional 
manipulation 
plus 
sexual 

assault equals abuse.”

Their relationship is one of 

the most realistic portrayals 

of abusive relationships that 
I’ve ever seen on TV. It’s not 
exploitative, 
gimmicky 
or 

victim-blaming. 
The 
effects 

of Kilgrave’s emotional and 
psychological manipulation and 
isolation of Jessica from her 
friends are given just as much 
screen time and discussion 
as his actual sexual assault. 
Jessica 
organically 
cycles 

through 
periods 
of 
fight, 

flight or freeze throughout the 
whole season. She struggles 
to 
recapture 
her 
agency 

throughout the 13 episode arc, 
and has more success at some 
points than others.

Our disgust at how Kilgrave 

has 
treated 
Jessica 
and 

our 
understanding 
of 
his 

backstory grow and deepen 
simultaneously. But the reveal 
of 
Kilgrave’s 
own 
rough 

childhood 
isn’t 
utilized 
as 

an excuse for how he treats 
Jessica — the writers forcefully 
make that clear. There’s a very 
obvious, easy possibility for a 
redemption story with Kilgrave, 
but the writers refused to 
write it that way. The atrocity 
of how Kilgrave treats her is 
highlighted by the disbelief 
we feel when we realize he 
doesn’t see the relationship as 
abusive, but as complicated and 
potentially loving.

There are so many other 

aspects of “Jessica Jones” that 
I could talk about (again) for 
hours — lesbian representation 
on TV, a near perfect score, 
beautiful 
cinematography, 

Tennant’s 
hypnotic 

performance as Kilgrave and 
Ritter’s nuanced portrayal of 
Jessica — but though those are 
all important, the gritty and 
realistic portrayal of an abusive 
relationship is what sticks with 
me the most. In a TV world 
where sexual assault and rape 
are so often used as gratuitous 
plot-drivers or for shock value, 
“Jessica Jones” explores these 
difficult topics with an eye and 
ear for subtlety and empathy.

Women on TV in general are 

still overwhelmingly given flat, 
two-dimensional 
roles 
that, 

in the words of my eloquent 
roommate, “could be played 
by a broom with a blonde wig 
and balloons that look like tits 
taped on them.” We need more 
shows like “Jessica Jones” with 
unapologetically feminist vibes.

Until we get another one, 

we’ll just have to keep our 
fingers crossed for a second 
season.

If you haven’t jumped on the 

“Jones” train yet, you really 
should.

None of 

Jessica Jones’s 
complexity is 

contrived.

If you haven’t 
jumped on the 
‘Jones’ train yet, 

you should.

We need more 

shows with 

unapologetically 
feminist vibes.

Michigan’s inevitable loss

I

t seemed easy for the 
Michigan women’s 
basketball team to roll to a 

7-0 start to the season — maybe 
too easy.

Before 

Sunday’s loss 
to Princeton, 
the 
Wolverines 
had averaged 
87.9 points 
per game, 
making them 
the third-
best scoring 
offense in the 
country. They 
surpassed 100 points against 
South Carolina Upstate, wiped 
the Crisler Center floor with 
Xavier and avenged last season’s 
21-point loss to Pittsburgh.

Even without the presence 

of the last year’s veteran senior 
class, Michigan still reversed 
the storyline against Pittsburgh 
by churning out a 37-point win 
this time around. Whether from 
observation or on paper, the 
Wolverines haven’t struggled 
during nonconference play.

With such a young team, 

though, you knew a loss was 
coming.

It shouldn’t have been too 

surprising that Michigan lost 
to Princeton on Sunday. That 
doesn’t necessarily mean the 
Wolverines couldn’t compete 
at that level, but they were 
still rough around the edges 
through those first seven games. 
Michigan knew it couldn’t get 
too comfortable either, as players 
continued to emphasize that 
each game is different from 
the next and that early-season 
mistakes won’t suffice during Big 
Ten play.

Passing and shooting 

mistakes weren’t difference-
makers against Detroit or 
Hartford, but were exactly what 
drew the line between a win 
and a loss against Princeton. 
The Tigers were on the verge 
of breaking into the top 25 and 
still had the taste of Wolverine 
blood from last season, when 
Princeton embarrassed 
Michigan to the tune of a 

30-point victory in Ann Arbor.

This time around, being in 

New Jersey couldn’t have made 
it any easier for the Wolverines. 
But then again, they took a 
30-point loss to Princeton and 
turned it into a 17-point loss — an 
improvement.

More importantly, Michigan 

has a group of freshmen that 
aren’t playing like freshmen. In 
fact, they’ve accounted for over 
a third of Michigan’s points so 
far this season. Anyone can dish 
the ball to center Hallie Thome; 
guards Nicole Munger and 
Boogie Brozoski have proved to 
be lights out beyond the 3-point 
line; and forward Sam Trammel 
has shown great promise on the 
defensive end. 

“They’re winners,” said 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “They’re competitive, 
they’re a top-rated class in 
the country. … But they are 
inexperienced. They’re gonna 
have some really great moments 
for us, and I’m sure they’re gonna 

have some challenging moments 
as well.”

Sunday, the first of many 

challenging moments to come hit 
Michigan, and hit it hard enough 
to take the freshman class out of 
the game entirely. Thome scored 
just three points and seemed 
to always position herself on 
the end line for a pass, making 
it even more difficult to get a 
good look at the basket during a 
double team. Munger, Brozoski 
and Trammel combined for six 
turnovers and just four points.

For a freshman class that 

had gone all of high school 
doing nothing but winning — 
combining for a 107-9 record in 
its senior year — Sunday’s loss 
must have been a reality check. 
Last week, Barnes Arico said 
they didn’t know how to lose.

But maybe some experience in 

that department wouldn’t hurt.

In fact, Sunday’s loss was 

exactly the dose of medicine 
Michigan needed to remedy 
its winner’s high. It needed 

to experience defeat, because 
it hadn’t since April 1 against 
UCLA in the WNIT Semifinals 
last season. Coincidentally, the 
Bruins are the very same team 
the Wolverines will face Sunday 
on the Crisler hardwood.

Whether Michigan recognizes 

it or not, Sunday’s loss may be the 
motivating factor to not make the 
same mistakes again — or at least 
make them on a less consistent 
basis.

For instance, if sophomore 

guard Katelynn Flaherty has 
a 33-point night, that should 
almost guarantee a win. It 
shouldn’t mean 24.1 percent 
team shooting and 22 turnovers, 
factors that made a meaningful 
performance by Flaherty in her 
home state irrelevant.

That can’t happen again if the 

Wolverines hope to dance in the 
NCAA Tournament.

This could very well be the 

year that Michigan makes it to 
that stage of the postseason, and 
losing to Princeton may have 

been the best way to remind the 
Wolverines that the road to the 
Round of 64 won’t be laden with 
teams like Oral Roberts and 
South Carolina Upstate.

Instead, Michigan’s going 

to face six top-25 teams: No. 5 
Maryland, No. 10 Ohio State, No. 
12 Northwestern, No. 20 UCLA, 
No. 23 Iowa and No. 25 Michigan 
State.

It’d be better for the 

Wolverines to purge themselves 
of mistakes now rather than 
later. Losing games in December 
is part of the learning curve, and 
a poor performance now won’t 
mean as much as it would in 
February.

A loss to Princeton this 

early in the season does more 
good than harm for Michigan, 
and the Wolverines should be 
thankful that they can still 
afford that luxury.

Catching up with 
‘surrender cobra’

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan sophomore Chris 

Baldwin is finally breathing easily.

Baldwin 
— 
who 
claimed 

Internet fame when an image of 
him with his hands over his head 
went viral following the Michigan 
football team’s last-second loss 
to Michigan State earlier this 
year — had his hands raised over 
his head again on Saturday as 
he watched the Michigan men’s 
basketball team take on Houston 
Baptist. 
This 
time, 
though, 

Baldwin, along with the rest of 
the student section at the Crisler 
Center, had his hands up high and 
fingers wiggling as sophomore 
guard Aubrey Dawkins stepped 
to the line for free throws late 
in Michigan’s 82-57 rout of the 
Huskies.

Baldwin, 
an 
engineering 

student from Saginaw, Mich., 
said that before Michigan’s loss 
to Michigan State, he was “no 
different than anybody else — 
just a good sports fan.” But that 
day, when Michigan punter Blake 
O’Neill bobbled a snap with time 
expiring and the Spartans ran 
the ball back for a game-winning 
touchdown, that all changed. 
ESPN’s cameras focused in on a 
stunned Baldwin, and the image 
quickly went viral.

“I guess I was doing the 

surrender cobra pose,” Baldwin 
said. “And now everybody knows 
who I am. … I felt a bunch of text 
messages right after the game 
ended, but I figured it was just 
people talking about the game 
because, of course, it was crazy, 
and then when I finally looked 
as we were getting ready to head 
out of the stadium, I had all sorts 

of texts and tweets and things on 
Facebook — all sorts of pictures 
and people talking about how I 
was suddenly famous.”

The pose — known as the 

“surrender cobra” — is a common 
sight in stadiums following come-
from-behind wins and thrilling 
finishes. It consists of hands over 
the head, elbows pointed out and 
jaw dropped — making speechless 
spectators resemble the venomous 
snake. The pose even got its 
own segment on ESPN’s College 
GameDay last week, in which 
Baldwin was featured.

“I’ve tried to have fun with 

it,” Baldwin said. “Of course, 
everybody here at (the University) 
supports me, because they all felt 
the same way I did.”

Another image of Baldwin 

doing the pose, this time in 
Detroit Lions gear, went viral 
after the NFL team suffered a 
Hail Mary loss at the hands of the 
Green Bay Packers on Thursday. 

It was actually taken at an earlier 
date — Baldwin watched that 
game in his dorm room, and he 
was able to restrain himself from 
breaking out the cobra.

“I kind of felt like that pose,” 

he said. “But I don’t think I was 
doing it.”

So after lots of devastation, 

when Michigan hosted Houston 
Baptist in a guarantee game on 
Saturday, it meant that Baldwin 
would most likely be able to keep 
the cobra in the cage for the game. 
But after some of the finishes he’s 
seen, he wasn’t 100 percent sure.

“I guess there’s no guarantees, 

especially 
after 
last 
year’s 

season,” Baldwin said during the 
second half. “But yeah, it’s nice 
not to worry as much about the 
game and just kind of enjoy it.”

On Saturday, he did get to 

enjoy it. Michigan rolled past the 
Huskies and — at least for one 
day — the cobra got to go into 
hibernation.

Wolverines routed by SMU

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

Against No. 19 Southern 

Methodist, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team didn’t have its 
bread and butter.

Heading into their matchup 

with 
the 
Mustangs, 
the 

Wolverines (6-3) were shooting 
43.9 
percent 
from 
beyond 
the arc. In the first half of their 
82-58 loss Tuesday, they went 
just 2-for-14 on their 3-point 
attempts. Junior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr., who was averaging 
9.6 points and 4.6 rebounds 
per game — making him the 
Wolverines’ 
second-leading 

rebounder — sat out his second 
straight game with a lateral 
ankle sprain. Senior guard Caris 
LeVert, who leads the team with 
18.6 points per game, made just 
one field goal on 13 attempts.

The trend continued into 

the second half, and Michigan 
couldn’t keep up. The Mustangs 
(7-0) clobbered the Wolverines 
in SMU’s Moody Coliseum, 
handing Michigan its third non-
conference loss of the season.

Though the first half exposed 

many 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

flaws, it wasn’t all negative. 
Sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman, starting 
in place for Walton, scored 
Michigan’s first six points to 
keep the Wolverines in the 
game and hushed the Mustangs’ 
lead scorer, 5-foot-9 guard Nic 
Moore, in the contest’s early 
minutes. Abdur-Rahkman went 
6-for-10 shooting and finished 
with 15 points.

Junior forward Zak Irvin, 

who has been largely quiet since 
returning from his offseason 
back surgery, scored a loud nine 
points when his teammates 
needed it most.

But SMU went on scoring 

runs 
at 
numerous 
points, 

including a five-minute, 10-0 
run that was finally put to an 
end 
when 
Abdur-Rakhman 

stripped the ball from Mustang 
guard Jarrey Foster and threw 
it to redshirt sophomore guard 
Duncan Robinson, who then fed 
it to sophomore forward Kam 
Chatman for a jumper.

Moore 
finally 
made 
a 

statement with 
three minutes 
left in the half 
with back-to-
back 
triples, 

the second one 
coming off a 
straight-on, 
long-range 
3. 

Less 
than 
a 

minute 
later, 

LeVert double-
dribbled 
on 

the other end, 
giving the ball back to Mustangs 
forward Jordan Tolbert, who 
followed up with back-to-back 
dunks. 

SMU ended the frame on a 

15-4 run, making its final six 
attempts to head into the locker 
room with a lofty 14-point lead.

The Wolverines were able to 

trim the gap to nine points in the 
second half after back-to-back 
3-pointers from Robinson and 
Irvin made it 39-30, but despite 
Robinson’s best efforts — his 15 
points tied Abdur-Rahkman for 
the team lead — the Mustangs 
continued 
to 
wallop 
the 

Wolverines. Michigan allowed 
10 dunks, nine of which were 
scored by Tolbert, who ended 
the game with 23 points on 
11-for-12 shooting.

“(Tolbert with) four offensive 

rebounds per game ... I don’t 
think I’ve seen that, and I’ve 
seen a lot of stats,” Beilein said. 
“He just goes and gets the ball. 
He was like a man playing with 
boys out there — he just went 

and got it.”

LeVert’s 
shooting 
woes 

continued into the second half, 
with his first and only field goal 
coming with just 4:36 left in the 
game. Last season, SMU also 
effectively shut down LeVert, 
who scored just four points in 
Michigan’s 62-51 loss at home 
on Dec. 20.

 “We had two days to rest, 

so we tried to rest (LeVert) 

on 
Sunday,” 

Beilein 
said. 

“We’ve 
been 

leaning on him 
an awful lot, 
so he’ll bounce 
back, 
but 
it 

was a tough 
game for him. 
… Who knows 
what 
it 
is, 

but they did 
a 
great 
job 

against 
him. 

They switched a lot of screens 
when he came off, they really 
challenged him, and he had a 
tough game. When he’s missing 
foul shots, you know he’s having 
a tough game.”

The 
Wolverines 
left 
the 

court in Dallas with plenty of 
missed opportunities, including 
a final stretch where they 
shot 0-for-6 in the last three 
minutes. Michigan was also 
outrebounded by the Mustangs, 
45-20, mostly on the defensive 
end. 

After flying home Tuesday, 

Michigan will take a much 
needed three-day rest after its 
seventh game in 19 days and 
before Saturday’s matchup with 
Delaware State.

“We’re still young in the 

season,” Beilein said. “If you’re 
going to get beat, get beat early. 
And this shows you, like I said, 
if you think you’re good, you’re 
not good. 

“That team’s good. We’re a 

long way from being good.”

Wolverines prepare for unknown

Michigan readies 
for first bowl under 

Harbaugh

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Four months ago, almost to 

the day, the Michigan football 
team assembled in Ann Arbor 
for the start of fall practice on 
Aug. 7. Jim Harbaugh had been 
head coach for just over seven 
months, including one spring 
camp, but still, an unknown lay 
ahead.

The 
Wolverines 
had 
no 

idea what to expect out of 
Harbaugh’s first fall camp. They 
didn’t know what time practices 
would be. They didn’t know 
what they would entail. In his 
media day press conference 
Aug. 6, Harbaugh proclaimed 
that his team was going into 
a “submarine” and using a 

“bunker mentality.” No one was 
quite sure what that meant.

That camp laid the foundation 

for a year of rebirth, one in 
which the Wolverines regained 
their dignity, Harbaugh said 
Monday. Thursday, as Michigan 
begins its preparation for the 
Jan. 1 Citrus Bowl, it will end 
the season the same way it 
started it: with a long month of 
practice and preparation, with 
unclear expectations.

“Not until Coach Harbaugh 

lays it all out and really sends 
us a schedule on everything, 
what it’s going to be like and 
stuff,” said senior linebacker 
Joe Bolden on Monday. “So no, I 
have no idea right now, standing 
here talking to you.”

Not under Harbaugh, at least. 

The Wolverines last played 
in a bowl game in 2013, when 
they lost to Kansas State in the 
Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl, 31-14. 
This year, they again have the 
opportunity to spend the last 

month of the season refining 
technique 
and 
correcting 

weaknesses in preparation for 
next season.

“I think it’s really a big 

deal for us to get those extra 
15 
practices, 
which 
goes 

overlooked 
sometimes,” 
said 

junior tight end Jake Butt on 
Monday. “Just getting those 
young players those 15 practices, 
that’s another spring ball. That 
can go a long way for player 
development.”

Another 
shakeup 
is 
the 

departure 
of 
defensive 

coordinator D.J. Durkin, who 
took the head coaching job at 
Maryland. 
Chris 
Partridge, 

previously 
the 
director 
of 

player personnel, will take over 
Durkin’s role as linebackers 
coach for the bowl game, and 
defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 

Mattison will coordinate the 
defense. Mattison previously 
led the unit from 2011 to 2014 
under Brady Hoke.

“(For) some of us, (Mattison 

is) what we know better, in a 
way,” Bolden said. “I’ve played 
three of my four years under 
him. I love how he coached and 
how he coaches. I came in and 
my first game was under him, 
and I’m going out and my last 
game’s going to be played with 
him calling the defense, too. 
So, it’s pretty exciting from my 
standpoint.”

Other than the role changes, 

Michigan has a fair level of 
continuity, perhaps giving it the 
opportunity to heal for the bowl 
game. Most notably, fifth-year 
senior quarterback Jake Rudock 
is recovering from a shoulder 
injury 
he 
suffered 
in 
the 

regular-season finale against 
Ohio State.

On both sides of the ball, the 

Wolverines will go back to the

regular season with a tough 
42-13 loss to the Buckeyes at 
Michigan Stadium, and while 

they will still finish 0-2 against

all over to conclude the season.

“I’m not too sure what to

Catt rising fast in net for Michigan

The freshman 
goaltender could 

receive more 
playing time

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

 As the Michigan hockey 

team began its shootout against 
Wisconsin on Saturday, all eyes 
were on junior forward Tyler 
Motte as he took the puck from 
center ice and went in on goal 
to try to give the Wolverines an 
early advantage.

That is, all eyes except for 

freshman goaltender Chad Catt’s.

While all of the 5,466 fans 

in attendance held their breath 
in 
anticipation 
of 
Motte’s 

opportunity, Catt was bent over 
on his own end, staring at the ice 
and waiting for the crowd to tell 
the tale of his teammate’s effort.

When a groan resonated 

throughout the crowd, Catt 
turned around, ready to face 
Badger 
forward 
Cameron 

Hughes.

Hughes 
carried 
the 
puck 

down the ice and fired, but the 
freshman netminder made the 
save. Next came Michigan junior 
center JT Compher’s goal. Once 
again, Catt refused to watch but 
listened as the crowd erupted.

Now 
it 
was 
Wisconsin 

forward Luke Kunin’s turn to 
beat Catt, but he shut the door 
on that effort, too.

Catt turned around once 

more, as Alex Kile skated toward 
net with a chance to clinch 
victory. The junior forward lit 
the lamp on the opposite end for 
the Wolverines.

Game 
over 
— 
Catt 
had 

completed his first career Big 
Ten appearance in dramatic 
fashion.

As for Catt’s refusal to watch 

his team shoot, every goalie has 
a quirk, and this was his.

“In my first year in Aberdeen 

(in the North American Hockey 
League), we went into a lot of 
shootouts,” Catt said. “I just 

was in practice, not worrying 
about what was going on outside 
of my end. So I kind of brought 
that into our shootouts, where I 
don’t need to worry about what 
the goalie is doing down there. I 
just need to take care of my end 
and make saves, and hopefully 
our guys put one or two in.”

Added 
goaltending 
coach 

Steve Shields: “It’s what the guy 
does to be ready. I did idiotic 
stuff that people would think 
is stupid. Whatever he needs to 
do to stop the puck, I think at 
this point, the coaches are like, 
‘Do whatever you have to do.’ … 
If you can stop the puck, you’ll 
have your way around here.”

Prior to Saturday, Catt had 

played only one period in an 
exhibition against Toronto and 
10 minutes in the Wolverines’ 
7-3 blowout of Niagara.

But when he replaced junior 

goaltender 
Zach 
Nagelvoort 

after 
the 
starter 
conceded 

four goals 30 minutes into the 
matchup with the Badgers, Catt 
was thrown into hot water.

It was the second game of the 

Big Ten season, Michigan trailed 
Wisconsin 4-3, and Michigan 
coach Red Berenson sent the 
freshman in to stop the bleeding.

Despite the pressure, Catt 

delivered.

The Badgers found twine 

twice with Catt in goal, but 
both goals were far from the 
goaltender’s fault. He saved 
12 of the 14 shots sent his way, 
giving the Wolverines enough 
to complete the comeback, and 
his performance in the shootout 
speaks for itself.

“It’s difficult in the respect 

that the expectations of you 
from the outside world are very 
limited any other day of the 
week,” Shields said. “But in a 
tie game or a game where it’s 
close and you’re down behind 
at home in the Big Ten regular 
season — all of a sudden, you’re 
the last line of defense. It would 
be considered tough. … For me, 
I know what it felt like to be in 
that situation.

“It’s 
an 
opportunity. 

Players always talk about the 

opportunity that they want. He 
was given an opportunity, and 
that day he ran with it.”

Before the season started, 

Catt was an 
afterthought 
as a candidate 
to 
anchor 

Michigan’s 
defense. 
He 

was 
buried 

behind 
Nagelvoort 
and 
senior 

Steve 
Racine 

in the depth 
chart 
and 

expected to strictly serve in a 
backup role.

Now Racine is week-to-week 

with a lower-body injury, and 
Nagelvoort has struggled after 
some impressive outings to start 
the season.

By no means is Catt a lock to 

start in net, but that may enter 
into the realm of possibility — 
especially as the coaching staff 
takes notice of the progress he 

has made since 
October.

Berenson 

said Catt looks 
much 
more 

acclimated to 
the speed of 
college hockey 
— 
something 

that 
was 

impossible 
for the now-
21-year-old 

freshman to prepare for with 
the Aberdeen Wings. He also 
emphasized that far fewer pucks 
are getting past Catt in practice, 
leaving the coaches with the 
feeling that their freshman 
netminder is in a good place at 
the moment.

And Shields explained that 

Catt has had great days in 
practice, but also days when he 
thinks the freshman would like 
a “do-over.”

Those 
“do-overs” 
are 
a 

sign that Catt still has a lot of 
room for improvement, but 
that is something he willingly 
acknowledges.

At the beginning of the 

season, 
Catt 
and 
Shields 

reached 
an 
agreement 

on 
a 
unique 
program 
for 

improvement the pair could 
work on. There are two things 
stressed 
in 
that 
program: 

posture and explosiveness.

Catt is just 5-foot-10 — short 

compared to Nagelvoort and 
Racine, who stand 6-foot-3 and 
6-foot-1, respectively — so he 
is working to get in the habit 
of standing upright as much as 
possible to prevent the opposition 

from shooting high on him.

As for explosiveness, Catt 

explained that he previously 
made calm pushes from post 
to post and would have to keep 
sliding over to get in position. 
But at this level, that’s not an 
option. Catt quickly recognized 
that if he stuck to his old habits, 
forwards would be shooting 
while he was still adjusting.

But on Saturday, there were 

still plenty of positive signs 
from the freshman — enough 
that 
someone 
on 
Twitter 

compared him to goaltender 
Julie “The Cat” Gaffney from 
“D2: The Mighty Ducks.”

“I get that a lot,” Catt said. 

“Every team I’ve played on, 
it has come up at least once 
or twice. I mean, it’s a movie, 
it’s funny. No, (I don’t prefer 
Goldberg), I don’t at all. I prefer 
her style compared to his.”

“I did idiotic 

stuff that people 
would think is 

stupid.”

“I feel like (my family members) would judge me 
or look at me differently (if they knew). Like ‘Hey 

mom, what’s going on? Is it OK if we talk about sex?’ I 
would probably go to someone else … We had the sex

Hate in the time of Facebook

B Y N A B E E L C H O L L A M PAT

LUNA ANNA ARCHEY/DAILY

THOUGHT BUBBLE

COVER BY LUNA ARCHEY

THE ‘TALK’

I 

sit there, waiting. An all-too familiar feeling 
is coursing through my blood, and my head 
is in my homework but my heart is here, on 

my computer. I close some tabs here and there, 
but reopen them every once in a while, hoping for 
the name. I’m biting my nails, making jokes with 
my roommates in the meantime, getting up for a 
glass of water, and then I see it.

Suspect identified.
I’m hoping, praying for the wrong thing, 

misguided in my desires, but it’s all for naught. 
The name is Muslim-sounding. And my heart, 
heavy and lonely and full of anger and grief and 
all the weight of my skin color and first name 
and religion, sinks.

How sad is it that, mere minutes after the 

shooting in San Bernardino was reported and I 
texted my friend in Riverside, my next thought 
was of fear? All the way in Michigan, I was 
scared. Of the shooter being Muslim. Of people 
sitting there chomping at the bit for a suspect 
name, perversely waiting for it to be foreign, 
for it to be Arab, for the skin to be brown and 
the beard to be long. Of the tide of Muslim-hate 
growing, as it has for a while now. And I, just as 
guilty of completely forgetting the victims and 
their families, turned masochist. I went online.

The Internet is the world’s most lawless play-

ground. For all that it provides, it coaxes out the 
worst in people, and it’s hard to turn away. Yes, 
I’ve seen all the thinkpieces detailing, in great 
and unnecessary length, why Muslims are good 
and “to not let the actions of a few define a whole 

group of people.” I’ve seen this so much that it 
starts to annoy me. Instead, I spend much of my 
time on the Internet reading comments about 
Muslims from random people on Facebook. 
The comments are disgusting, vile and some of 
the worst things you can find online. For each 
comment I read, each tweet I pore over, each 
personally recorded YouTube video of a guy in 
his room explaining how we should deal with 
the Muslim problem, I am baffled. I know it’s 
stupid, but I can’t stop. I’ll find a particularly 
nasty one, click on the profile and stalk the shit 
out of them.

How are people this horrible? How can they 

feel this way? What traumatic event in their 
lives made them so hateful? How many Mus-
lims do they actually, personally know? Behind 
the screen, we are anonymous. Sure, our names 
are there, along with our hometowns and pro-
file pictures and favorite movies. But that’s not 
really us. That’s not a corporal being that we 
can see or hear. And for the perpetrator, there is 
no recipient for his hate. There is no one hurt-
ing, crying, humiliated — at least not that he can 
see.

Before the Internet, I couldn’t do this. I 

couldn’t have the new “Batman v. Superman” 
trailer open in one tab and some racist douche 
from Arkansas’ Facebook profile open in the 
next. Before, I would not have been aware of 
such existences. But now, I know exactly who 
hates me. I am no longer in the dark.

D

ear Google,

I’ve been in a few relationships, and 

whenever I’ve had sex, I always have 

felt so excited at first and then quickly just … 
disappointed. What can I do to not feel this 
disappointment? Do I need to lower my expec-
tations to be more realistic or have I just not 
found the one, magical guy that will make me 
feel spectacular in bed?

Sincerely,
Insufficient Intercourse

***

Dear Insufficient Intercourse,
Maybe I haven’t seen enough male butts in my 

life, but frankly I was under the naive impression 
that if you’ve seen one man’s butt, you’ve seen 
them all.

This turned out not to be true, and it’s these 

kind of little surprises that I believe impact a 
person’s ability to enjoy sex: maybe for me it 
was a butt that was a little more hairy than I had 
imagined, but for others it’s sweat or gross human 
liquids or unexpected noises or any of the other 
messy, uncomfortable possibilities that arise when 
doing something as intimate as having sex.

This moment, when I felt a little disappointed 

by the realities of the little things that sex often 
includes, became a silly thing I tease my boy-
friend about. It did not become a reason to feel 
underwhelmed sexually. Maybe for you it is more 
than just dealing with real, non-porno sex, but I 
think it’s pretty common for men and women to 
enter into relationships — or hook ups, etc. — with 

extraordinarily high expectations for their sexual 
experience.

Society’s influence on sex is so penetrative into 

our lives I have to think feelings of disappointment 
are inevitable. The reality of sex is this: the person 
you are having sex with is probably a human and, 
as such, have all of these gross human functions 
and illogical feelings. And you, assuming you are 
also a human, do to.

So it’s really fucking messy in more ways than 

one — emotionally complicated and physically 
confusing.

It’s what gives intimate moments their worth. 

It is difficult, at times. Being uncomfortable is 
something I sort of crave, though. I feel filled up by 
silences that result from a complete loss of words 
in these compromising situations. I feel thrilled 
by the vulnerability of it all. It feels difficult, but 
genuine.

And so, I’m dating a guy whose butt is, like, real-

ly extraordinarily hairy. (I wish I could include a 
photo but I feel like my editor would object.) But 
it’s so him, and there’s something interesting when 
you share with a person the things about you that 
you can’t change — the things you don’t necessarily 
like, but that just are unequivocally, you.

So I’ll leave you with this Beyonce lyric, and ask 

you to find beauty in the realities of sex, the details 
and the impropriety of it all.

She sings, “You showed your ass and I … I saw 

the real you.” I think she’s talking about a man 
with a hairy butt.

Sincerely,
Emma

Last week, the Daily distributed its annual Sex Survey to 4,000 randomly selected undergraduates.
About 700 responded, providing us insights into the sexual norms and perceptions of our campus.
Here, we present some of our most intriguing results.


E

ditor’s Note: Students interviewed for this 
article have asked to only be identified by 
their first names due to personal subject 

matter.

In a coffee shop Monday morning, when the 

fog blocked out much of the sunlight and misted 
the windows adjacent us, I asked Vic to tell me 
about his sex life. Vic, an engineering sophomore 
who seemed years older due to his collected, 
thoughtful way of speaking, told me about the 
loneliness he felt during his first few months in 
his freshman year. Glancing out at the grey sky 
blurred by our window, he remembered how 
friends and the people Vic knew from his high 
school were having sex, and he wasn’t.

Like many new freshman, Vic left his family, 

high school friends and neighbors behind him 
to enroll in a university where he barely knew 
anyone. Away from their parents for the first time, 
college students are free to engage in behavior 
they wouldn’t want their parents knowing about 
— such as having casual sex.

Being surrounded by thousands of completely 

new people while also being away from their 
parents for the first time can make college seem 
like the ideal place to have frequent, casual sex. 
But this is not the case for many University 
students; in fact, most students abstain or stay 
away from casual sex altogether.

The Michigan Daily conducted a survey 

asking students about various aspects of their 
sex life. The survey had a sample size of about 
700 undergraduate students roughly evenly 
distributed between all four classes. Fifty-seven 
percent of respondents identified as women, 41 
percent as men and the remaining as a non-binary 
gender identity.

Of the respondents, 28 percent said they 

considered themselves virgins.

About one-third reported they had not had 

sex this semester, and about the same proportion 
reported having regular sex — sex at least once a 
week. 

Though the Daily’s survey reflects just 

University students, this pattern is similar for 
many campuses in the nation. According to the 
Online College Social Life Survey, which surveyed 
the sex life of college students at 21 universities 
between 2005 and 2011, 20 percent of college 
students graduate without ever having sex.

Vic is among the University students who 

chose not to have sex while in college.

He said he had never dated anyone in high 

school and his town was relatively more 
conservative. After coming to college, Vic noticed 
more people engaging in casual sex and felt 
insecure that he still was not.

“This is the loneliest time any of us have ever 

encountered,” he said. “Most of us have grown up 
knowing the same people for a decent chunk of 
time, there’s never been a time you haven’t been 
forced into trying to find new people, for most of 
us. I just think that out of that loneliness and that 
lack of connection, hook up culture seems like it’s 
the easiest way to get into it.”

However, Vic realized after making good 

friends who did not feel the need to hook up with 
random people, the feeling he was missing out 
slowly decreased.

“I am the least lonely I have been in a long time; 

I am not having sex,” he said. “I have incredible 
friends that I can talk to about my feelings 
whenever, and it’s really, really powerful.”

Like Vic, Linda said she has never had sex. 

An LSA junior, she said though she was raised 
in a conservative home that didn’t value casual 
sex, over time she realized this was also the 
best decision for her own well-being. She 
realized waiting ensures she is more emotionally 
connected to her partner, which leads to a 
healthier relationship with the other person.

Taylor, an Engineering junior, also abstains 

from sex in college. He said he does not envy 
hearing other men discuss the girls they slept 
with, but rather feels bad they are selfishly going 
out to appease their own desires rather than 
establish a committed relationship. However, 
Taylor admits sometimes struggling to abstain in 
a college environment.

“I wouldn’t say that I am tempted by it or desire 

it, but that being said I do have my own struggles,” 
he said. “We are sexual beings, we want to have 
relationships. I do want to have sex.”

In the survey, the Daily asked virgins why they 

had chosen to abstain from sex. Though many 
people stated religion as their primary reason 
for not having sex, respondents also stated they 
were “waiting for the right person” or they “were 
not into hooking up,” among a variety of other 
answers.

Engineering sophomore Asher, too, abstains 

from sex in college. He said when he drinks and 
goes out to parties, he notices sex as sometimes 
being an “end goal” of the night. He said casual 
sex does not appeal to him because in the long 
term, he knows he would rather wait to build 

an emotional connection with a partner rather 
than have casual sex with them. He said he sees 
hooking up at parties as the opposite of thinking 
long-term — it is instant gratification for a 
moment in time.

“My intent in going out was never to really 

participate in ‘hook up culture,’” Asher said. “At 
least personally to me, those kinds of physical 
relationship hold a lot more importance to me 
than just that instant gratification.”

Of survey respondents who remained virgins, 

67 percent of them say it has not impacted 
their college experience and 24 percent said it 
positively impacted it. Only 8 percent said it has 
negatively affected their time at college

Linda said though she recognizes hooking up 

and casual sex is a large part of some students’ 
lives, she found close friends that have her values 
and beliefs when it comes to relationships. She 
said stereotyping can sometimes make outsiders 
think college students are more concerned about 
hooking up than they actually are.

“There are a lot of people that are here for 

school, they’re here to study and they are here to 
take things seriously,” Linda said.

While about a third of students are engaging 

in sex regularly, the survey indicated that 
perceptions of sex might be skewed. When 
asked what portion of campus was engaging in 
sex, about half of respondents answered “many” 
or “most.”

Seth, an Engineering sophomore who also 

chooses not to participate in casual sex for 
religious reasons, said hooking up in college 
could sometimes become glorified because 
students consider it an ideal. He said sex is 
enticing to people because the people they want 
to be like — popular, well-liked kids on campus 
— seemed like they were having sex.

“The athletes, the people who got it figured 

out, they just have the world wrapped around 
their finger — they’re just having sex all the 
time,” Seth said. “It’s almost like high school all 
over again … It’s not so much everyone thinks 
everyone is doing it, it’s just that the people that 
we want to be are doing it.” 

To Vic, he said engaging people on campus in 

a conversation about sex could vastly help the 
feelings of being “left out” for those who have 
not had sex or don’t wish to have sex in college. 
As we wrapped up our conversation, I told him 
the results of the Daily’s survey, and how many 
students are virgins and or do not have casual 
sex in college.

Glancing out the window again, but this time 

to the sun’s reflection on the sidewalk, he said 
many people may feel pressured to hook up just 
out of loneliness and insecurity, but knowing 
that other people aren’t having sex as much as 
we think they are will help them make informed 
decisions about whether or not they want to 
have sex.

“If people knew that it’s at half, sixty percent, 

a lot less than what people think … if people 
knew then people would feel less left out,” he 
said.

Personal Statement: To the boy who didn’t rape me

I 

remember being scared for my sister when we first had 
to send her off to college. It, of course, was a combination 
of all the terrifying things that accompany sending the 

first child off to college, like being thousands of miles away 
from family and all alone for the first time, but what struck 
me the most was something she told me one of the first times 
I called her at school.

“Classes just started,” she said. “But I think the most 

important things I’ve learned so far is which frat is the date 
rape frat.”

Which frat is the date rape frat? The idea that a frat could 

exist with that identity horrified me. If everyone knew about 
this, why didn’t anyone stop it? How could it be OK for a 
fraternity to casually be known for raping girls?

Growing up, I was always vaguely aware of the constant 

risk of sexual assault. Don’t leave your drink unattended, 
don’t let someone else make your drink, always have 
someone to walk home with at night: the basic how-not-to-
get-raped rules that every girl is taught at a certain age. But 
when I actually started needing to apply these rules, the 
world I lived in was very different to the one I’m in now that 
I’m in college.

When I first started drinking and partying, I lived in 

China, so the whole culture surrounding drinking and sexual 
assault was vastly different. The Chinese government does 
not mess around when it comes to crime. Guns are illegal, 
drugs are very illegal — foreigners risk deportation if caught 
— and rape has the death penalty attached to it. On top of 
that, the government was always watching you through the 
cameras on every corner and the rumored hidden informants 
scattered throughout the city. With this, I never felt unsafe 
walking around at night or hanging out in a dingy bar; I felt 
safer there than in any other city because I knew everyone 
there was too afraid to break the law.

With this worldview, my sister’s words really shocked 

me. I had heard about the prevalence of sexual assault on 
college campuses, but I was always so disconnected from it 

that it never really affected me, until suddenly it did. It was 
my sister, right there in a place where one in every five girls 
would be assaulted. She was there where it was OK to joke 
about a particular fraternity having a reputation for taking 
advantage of drunk girls and putting things in their drinks. 
She was directly in harm’s way and there was nothing I could 
do about it.

Fast forward a year and I find myself in the same place. 

I remember how uncomfortable my mom looked when she 
saw how close my dorm was to the frat houses on move-in 
day, because without having to say anything, they implied 
risks. But I followed the rules: I always had a buddy, I 
watched my drink, I kept myself safe and I continued not 
focusing too much on the risks. I always felt in control and 
capable of keeping myself from becoming a statistic. Until 
the night where I almost didn’t.

After going out to a party, and admittedly drinking too 

much, I ended up back in the room of this boy — we will call 
him Tom — who I had hooked up with the weekend before. 
The time before, I had made it pretty clear to him that I 
wasn’t going to go so far as to have sex with him, but after 
stumbling back to his room things escalated very quickly. It 
started with simple kissing, but the next thing I knew I was 
naked in the bed of a boy I had known for a little over a week. 
I didn’t realize how drunk I was, and I was uncomfortably 
close to having sex that I did not want to have.

Thankfully, Tom is a very nice boy. Realizing how 

intoxicated and out-of-sorts I was, he stopped and told me 
he didn’t want to take advantage of me. At the time, it didn’t 
seem like much to me — I just sort of shrugged, rolled over, 
and fell asleep shortly after without thinking too much of it.

I like to think that I would have been capable of saying no 

if he had actually gone so far as to, say, whip out a condom, 
but I was very thankful that it didn’t get to that point. One 
thing I do know for sure is that I certainly would have been 
incapable of fighting back if he had decided that he was 
going to have sex with me that night — regardless of my 

consent.

The next morning, after I showered and pulled myself 

together a little bit, I started thinking about what happened 
and realized the gravity of it. What really drove home this 
awareness was Relationship Remix, a thing that I had up 
until that point been annoyed that I had to attend. Sitting in 
the YK Lounge in South Quad, talking about sexual assault 
(among other things) I realized that with some other boy, 
I could be one of those scary stories they tell freshmen. I 
thought about what I would have done. Would I have told 
anyone? If I did who would I have told? Would there really 
have been anything worth reporting?

After this realization, I sent Tom a nice little text to 

thank him for not taking advantage of me. In that moment, 
I genuinely felt appreciative of his actions. My thinking 
changed a little when I received his response.

“I’m glad you recognized it,” he said.
You’re glad I recognized it? As if you deserve some sort 

of medal for not raping me? In my mind, the appropriate 
response would follow the idea that he did what any decent 
human being would do, but those words served as a stark 
reminder that maybe that is not the case. Since when do we 
praise the boys who don’t take advantage of girls as morally 
superior? Should you really feel so great about yourself for 
not assaulting someone?

Now, I don’t really blame him too much for this (we are 

now actually pretty good friends), but I do blame this culture 
that has evolved around sexual assault. We live in a world 
where fraternities with a specific reputation for raping girls 
exist, a world where young girls are given lessons on how to 
avoid the potential attackers hidden around every corner, 
a world where the boy who didn’t rape me feels like a hero 
just for that basic human decency.

So to the boy who didn’t rape me: thank you for not taking 

advantage of me, but fuck the societal norms that surround 
the whole thing.

“There’s a story about this; we were on a road trip when I was five and my sis-

ter was seven and she was like ‘where do babies come from?’ and (our parents) 
explained the whole thing to us, and apparently she was really, really grossed 
out, and I thought it was hilarious.”

“Well I came out when I came to college, so obviously (talking about sex) is 

very different ... I come from a more conservative environment, and it’s defi-
nitely a bubble here where you are able to really, fully learn what you are inter-
ested in and express yourself. I go back home and it’s a completely different 
environment.”

— LSA junior Ryan Gentil

“I’m more comfortable with intimacy since coming to college, it’s something 

I’m more willing to talk about with people. It’s something that I seek out more 
and that I value in a different way. I don’t value it so much for ‘oh my gosh this is 
an experience I want to have’ as much as — I have a boyfriend, and it’s a person 
that I trust and I want to be with him, so it’s part of my life. I value it in a dif-
ferent way. To be honest, I didn’t feel any need for intimacy with any particular 
person until I met the guy I’m currently dating. Because, when you meet some-
one you just want to spend time with and who you want to share your life with, 
then that changes how you view intimacy that changes the dynamic that you 
have.”

“I was talking to my friend about this last week, what a woman has to be, 

to be seen as a sexual being is very different from what a man has to conform 
to. What she was saying was that, as a woman, she felt like she had to dress a 
certain way and be accessible in a certain way, and I was like it’s completely dif-
ferent for guys. We do have to dress a certain way but it’s more about ‘Are you 
acting powerful? Are you playing the game right? Are you being cool?’ It’s a very 
different mindset — at least within a certain social context.”
