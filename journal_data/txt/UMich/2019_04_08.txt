Sunday afternoon, students 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
gathered 
for 
the 
annual 
FestiFools public art parade on 
South Main Street in downtown 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Papier-maché 
puppets created and controlled 
by 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students and volunteers, along 
with other artists and dancers, 
performed under the theme 
“Dancin’ FOOLS.”
The parade, organized by 
WonderFool productions, is one 
in a series of public art parades 
the group puts on throughout 
the year, including FOOLmoon 
and ypsiGLOW. All of the events 
feature puppets and luminaries 
— puppets lit up in the dark — 
parading in a public area to both 

entertain the community and to 
increase appreciation for arts and 
arts education.
Emilia Smith, a volunteer 
at FestiFools who had traveled 
from Chicago for FOOLMoon 
and FestiFools, said her first 
experience with the puppets at 
FOOLMoon amazed her.
“I went to the FOOLMoon 
on Friday night and that was 
incredible,” Smith said. “I made 
a luminary that was a worm and 
that was really fun. Everyone was 
taking photos and dancing and 
enjoying it together so that was 
great, definitely brings people 
together, and brings out their 
creative sides.”
First-year students in the 
Lloyd Hall Scholars Program 
along 
with 
community 
volunteers 
created 
a 
vast 
majority of the puppets, which 

are human-powered and made 
using wires, papier-maché, fabric 
and any other materials students 
found. Puppets included a cow 
representing climate change, a 
dragon and one of Ann Arbor 
Mayor Christopher Taylor.
Students in the Lloyd Hall 
Scholars Program class Art in 
Public Spaces were tasked with 
building puppets conveying a 
message important to them. 
Engineering freshman Shivangi 
Sinha is enrolled in the course 
and built a puppet together of 
Queen Elizabeth II.
Sinha emphasized the work 
the students put into making the 
puppets and hoped onlookers 
would appreciate the messages 
within the art.
“I hope everyone has fun and 
sees students spent weeks on the 
puppets,” she said. “This past 

week we spent so many hours 
finishing our puppets.”
FestiFools also collaborates 
with Ypsilanti Community High 
School students to build artwork 
for the parade as well. Ypsilanti 
Community High School seniors 
Alexis Smith and Maximilian 
Harper created boxes they would 
wear in the parade to convey 
social justice issues important to 
them.
“We made a total of seven 
different boxes,” Harper said. 
“We wanted them all to cover 
different social issues, so I did 
gun violence, we did pride, we 
did women’s equality. And on the 
back, we all had letters, which all 
spell out ‘We are one.’”

The 
first 
Undergraduate 
Research Symposium, organized 
entirely by undergraduates, was 
held Friday in the Chemistry 
Building Atrium to showcase 
students’ 
multidisciplinary 
research projects.
About 150 students from over 40 
academic departments presented 
their research to more than 100 
graduate and postdoctoral judges. 
Top presenters were given one of 
10 $500 awards funding travel for 
future conferences.
LSA junior Jenna Manske, 
a member of the nine-person 
committee 
that 
founded 
the 
symposium, said the idea came to 
their group when they realized 
there was not a low-pressure space 
on campus for undergraduate 
students in any department to 
display their research.
“We were just sitting down one 
day and we thought there isn’t 
really a place for undergraduate 
students at any stage of their 
research to present that’s campus-
wide 
and 
multidisciplinary,” 
Menske said.

For the past 48 years, the first 
Saturday of April is accompanied 
by a potent haze that drifts across 
the Diag and all the way down 
State Street. At “high noon,” the 
University of Michigan’s campus 
welcomes a swarm of marijuana 
activists, 
entrepreneurs 
and 
enthusiasts 
from 
across 
the 
globe, all raising a joint in unison 
in celebration of the annual Hash 
Bash festival. This year, though, 

marked the start of a new era in 
cannabis culture.
In a 56-44-percent margin, 
Michigan voters passed Proposal 
18-1, 
an 
initiative 
legalizing 
marijuana for those above the 
age of 21. Michigan is the first 
state in the midwest to pass this 
legislation, joining California, 
Colorado and the District of 
Columbia, among others.
This 
Saturday, 
following 

the victory at the ballot box in 
November, a banner underneath 
the Harlan Hatcher Library 
that last year read “LEGALIZE 
2018,” was adjusted with black 
spray paint to now proclaim: 
“LEGALIZED 2018.”
Originally, Hash Bash was 
held on April 1, 1972 in protest 
of the conviction placed upon 
cultural activist and poet John 
Sinclair. 

The decision, made by the 
Michigan 
Supreme 
Court, 
sentenced Sinclair to 9.5 to 10 
years in prison for the possession 
of two marijuana joints.
This 
conviction 
sparked 
national outrage, prompting The 
John Sinclair Freedom Rally 
in 
1971, 
bringing 
worldwide 
superstars like John Lennon, 
Yoko Ono, Bob Seger and Stevie 
Wonder to the Crisler Center. 

Shortly 
after 
the 
historic 
assembly, Sinclair was released 
in December of 1971.
This year, Sinclair stepped up 
to the microphone to perform 
his spoken word poetry with 
guitarist Laith Al-Saadi, who 
kicked off the celebration with 
an electric guitar cover of the 
“Star Spangled Banner.” Before 
delivering his poetry, Sinclair 
encouraged the crowd to “light 

up and join me, if you got one,” 
and touched on how he’s seen the 
legacy of Hash Bash grow. 
“Welcome to legalization in 
the state of Michigan,” Sinclair 
said. “You haven’t been here 
before unless you were here in 
1972 when we started it.

Students for choice host Vagina Monologue 
spin-off to capture female experience

Patchwork event included monologues, songs, dances and other forms of expression

This 
weekend, 
Students 
for Choice hosted Patchwork, 
a spin-off from the Vagina 
Monologues, 
at 
Rackham 
Auditorium. The show included 
monologues, song, dance and 
other forms of expression.
Patchwork had pieces from 
American 
playwright 
and 
activist Eve Ensler interwoven 
with 
student-written 
performances. 
Participants 
included LSA sophomore Marya 
Matlin-Wainer and LSA junior 
Isabel Saville, who performed 
“A Teenage Girl’s Guide to 
Surviving Sex Slavery” and “I 
Am an Emotional Creature” 
respectively.

LSA 
sophomores 
Zoey 
Horowitz and Ruthie DeWit 
co-directed and performed in 
Patchwork. Horowitz and DeWit 
collaborated with Students for 
Choice and agreed a change 
needed to be made to allow for 
more diverse experiences of 
women or those who identify as 
women.
“We 
were 
both 
in 
the 
Vagina Monologues last year,” 
Horowitz said. “There were 
no directors (last year), so we 
decided to direct it and we talked 
to Students for Choice and we … 
kind of decided that we needed a 
change. The Vagina Monologues 
is really wonderful but a little bit 
outdated and just a very narrow 
representation of womanhood 
and gender expression and art 

form and we just wanted to open 
it up for everybody.”
LSA seniors Chelsea Chai and 
Megan 
Burns, 
co-presidents 
of Students for Choice, have 
continued the tradition of the 
Vagina 
Monologues 
every 
spring, and, after talking with 
executive board members and 
the co-directors, Patchwork was 
created.
“It’s from the ‘90s and it’s 
pretty white feminist, so it 
doesn’t include all the identities 
that 
we 
really 
wanted 
to 
represent,” Burns said. “We 
wanted more student-written 
work, we wanted more inclusive 
work and we wanted work that 
was younger, fresher and more 
original 
and 
representative 
of 
actual 
students 
at 
the 
university.”
Performers 
said 
they 
appreciated 
the 
change. 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Aini Robertson is co-captain 
of Ambiance dance team 
and said she enjoyed the 
opportunity to share her 
feelings through dance.
“I would say last year I 
started to discover more 
about being a woman, what 
I like about it, discovering 
more 
about 
myself,” 
Robertson said. “So this 
(year) is kind of like a chance 
for me to express myself a 
little bit more and hearing 
everybody’s monologues is 
always encouraging.”
LSA freshman Madelynn 
Brady attended the event 
with her friends to support 
one of the presenters.
“I think it’s a really good 
program 
that 
they 
have 
going and I’m glad that they 
call it women’s Patchwork 
because it’s kind of like tying 
stories together,” Brady said.
When 
asked 
if 
the 
organization 
is 
planning 
to 
phase 
out 
Vagina 

Monologues, 
Chai 
said 
the 
option could be a very real 
possibility.
“We’re very open to that 
route,” 
Chai 
said. 
“Since 
our 
organization 
is 
very 
collaborative, we really rely 
on the opinions of our e-board 
moving forward … and I think 

that we will most likely have 
something similar in its place 
something 
that 
has 
been 
mentioned has more student 
written work that kind of drives 
the content.”
Burns added she was grateful 
for other organizations’ events 
that allow women to speak 
on 
their 
experiences 
and 
believed Students for Choice 
could expand their message by 
creating more spaces.
“We wanted to contribute 
to that and also demonstrate 
that Students for Choice is 
more than just an issue about 
abortion,” Burns said. “It’s more 
about the overall experiences 
of womanhood, however that’s 
defined, so I think in the future 
our events will look a lot more 
like this, but also still do a lot of 
activism based events and also 
panels and performative events, 
things like that as well.”

Michigan in Color
Monday, April 8, 2019 — 3A

Dearborn, Michigan is 
the epicenter of Muslim/
Arab American culture. It is 
a microcosm of the Middle 
East with people from every 
Arab country (i.e. Lebanon, 
Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, 
Saudi Arabia, etc). There is 
such a diverse presence of 
nationalities and cultures 
that all contribute their own 
traditions 
while 
sharing 
similar 
traditions 
with 
other nationalities there . 
Although one might think 
that in this cultural hub 
we all have similar stories 
as minorities, we don’t. 
36 miles away from Ann 
Arbor is a city that portrays 
diversity and acceptance to 
the outside perspective, and 
although that is true in some 
sense, one group of people 
see themselves as superior 
to others.
Being Lebanese, I can 
attest to the fact that many 
people of my nationality 
think that they are better 
than everyone else. There 
is a running joke in my 
friend 
group 
that 
the 
Lebanese are the “white 
people” 
of 
Dearborn. 
That is to say that we are 
the 
problem. 
Lebanese 
are still minorities in the 
U.S., but like white people 
we’re privileged compared 
to everyone else when it 
comes 
to 
discrimination. 
In high school I would hear 
Lebanese 
boys 
jokingly 
call each other “Yemenis” 
as an insult , and see 
Lebanese kids fight with 
Iraqi kids for no reason. 

There is a clear superiority 
complex and it governs 
social 
life 
in 
Dearborn. 
Even 
within 
Lebanese 
culture, southern Lebanese 
people see all Baalbakis 
(those who come from the 
Eastern side of Lebanon) 
as extremists, drug dealers, 
or 
uber-conservatives. 
This superiority complex is 
synonymous to the problems 
of race in the U.S. today. 
While minorities are being 
persecuted from all around, 
and Islamophobia has spiked 
in the age of Trump against 
Muslims and Arabs, we are 
still unable to recognize 
each other as allies.
The reason I wanted to 
write this article is not to 
call anybody out, but to 
recognize the divergence 
among 
us. 
Why 
should 
colorism or discrimination 
among 
minorities 
with 
similar stories exist? As 
minorities, we should all 
recognize 
the 
fact 
that 
there we all share a similar 
problem: 
the 
existence 
of 
white 
supremacy, 
colonialism and people like 
our President who elicit 
hatred. Many of our parents 
came to the U.S. for the same 
reasons, whether it was to 
escape war in the Middle 
East, or for financial stability. 
My lesson for my Lebanese 
friends 
is 
to 
recognize 
that you aren’t better than 
anyone else. Your scat pack 
doesn’t make you cooler. 
Your jokes about Yemenis 
aren’t funny. Basically, if one 
person calls it dolma, but the 
other wara2 3einab (grape 
leaves), who cares!

On 
March 
2nd, 
influential 
actress 
and 
singer, 
Zendaya, 
showed her new line in 
collaboration with Tommy 
Hilfiger for the first time 
at Paris Fashion Week. 
Zendaya’s alternative and 
diverse fashion sense is 
praised by the masses, so 
the amount of excitement 
surrounding the debut of 
her line was only right. 
However, the clothes itself 
were not the only thing 
that we had to be excited 
about. Not only do the 
clothes make a statement, 
but Zendaya also seemed 
to be making a statement 
on representation with the 
structure of her show.
The Zendaya x Tommy 
show 
put 
together 
something that has never 
been done before in fashion 
history--a 
show 
entirely 
made up of Black models. 

Although all of the models 
are Black, not one model 
looked like another. Within 
the cast, there were diverse 
skin tones, a variation of 
hair textures and types, as 
well as diversity in age. The 
oldest model was fashion 
icon Grace Jones, who is 
seventy years old!
Many of us turn to the 
fashion world for what is 
hip and in style, and to 
recognize what is beautiful. 
Until now, Black women 
were not seeing themselves 
represented in the fashion 
industry, or even at all. 
With 
today’s 
wave 
of 
feminism, we see more 
diversity within previously 
white-dominated 
spaces. 
However, 
Zendaya 
took 
this farther beyond the 
one “token” Black model. 
Zendaya 
has 
not 
only 
broken boundaries but has 
set the tone for what true 
feminism 
and 
inclusion 
looks like in the fashion 
world.

I’ve never been good at math 
or science and seeing numbers 
of any sort make me cringe. This 
surprises people: I grew up as a 
classically trained pianist and 
attended a good private school, 
and of course, I’m also Asian. 
In high school, people would 
ask me if I was in BC Calc or 
AP Physics, even though I’ve 
only taken regular, college-
preparatory classes for STEM 
subjects. I would ask them why 
they thought I was in these 
advanced math classes, and my 
peers would respond with, “You 
just seem like a smart person and 
take all these other advanced 
classes, so I just assumed you’d 
be the type of person to be good 
at math too.” I am not “the type” 
of person who is good at math. 
And while I’m great at other 
things, I’ve noticed that people 
automatically assume I’m good 
with numbers all the time –– 
and it might not seem like a bad 
thing for people to assume this, 
but looking at the bigger picture, 
the model minority myth hurts 
rather than helps Asian students.

The model minority myth is 
the stereotype that Asians are 
seen as hardworking, smart, 
well-rounded people who excel 
at academics (getting straight 
A’s, top scores on the SAT and 
ACT… sound familiar?) and 
while it’s not a bad thing to 
care about your grades or be 
passionate about school work, it 
puts us into a box where we’re 
only seen as nerdy kids who study 
all day and are automatically 
good at math, which I am not. 
I am more than that: I love 
philosophy, 
history, 
politics, 
feminism, ‘80s music and going 
out on Friday nights –– just like 
any other American teenager. 
When all Asian students are put 
into a box, it can hurt how we 
perceive ourselves in the college 
admissions process –– this was 
definitely an issue I struggled 
with a year ago as a senior 
in high school. I was a good 
student in high school and cared 
very much about the classes I 
was interested in, was involved 
in a ton of extracurricular 
activities, and was (and still 
am) passionate about writing. 
But my standardized test scores 
were horrible, and the math 
section of my SAT’s was a total 

embarrassment. I knew that I 
was smart enough and deserved 
to get into a good college, but it 
frustrated me knowing that I 
had to get above a certain score 
to get into more selective schools 
and furthermore because of my 
race and people’s predisposed 
assumptions about what “kind” 
of student I was supposed to be.
My parents told me that 
I had to be twice as good as 
everyone 
else 
(namely 
my 
white peers) to get into these 
selective universities, because 
the competition among Asian 
students, who are all very 
qualified, is so cutthroat that 
there’s no way they could take 
all of us. And while this may 
be attributed to a number of 

reasons, I have a theory that the 
model minority myth reinforces 
a vicious circle in which Asian 
students 
feel 
pressured 
by 
the existing stereotype that 
they have to have perfect 
grades and standardized test 
scores to stand a chance against 
everyone else of getting into 
elite 
universities, 
and 
this 
leads to a reinforcement of that 
same stereotype that we really 
all are that smart and hard 
working, which raises the bar 
even higher for those who 
don’t fit into that mold. We are 
more than just “smart” and 
“hardworking.” Like everyone 
else, we’re complicated and 
passionate 
and 
multifaceted 
and our grade point averages 
and 
test 
scores 
aren’t 
the 
only things that measure our 
intelligence or how much we 
deserve to get into Harvard 
or UC Berkeley. As college 
decisions come out this season, 
I want to remind everyone going 
through the application process: 
There isn’t one singular thing 
that quantifies how smart or 
awesome you are. You should 
be able to tell your own story in 
your own words and show them 
that talent and resilience comes 
in many forms and being Asian 
doesn’t mean you have to be the 
prototypical textbook STEM 
nerd with perfect stats –– and 
even if that’s easier said than 
done, I was in the same boat a 
year ago. There’s a reason why 
the model minority myth is just 
what it is: a myth.

Before I began college, 
my dad told me that I’d end 
up being friends with those 
who were like me—that I’d 
stick to my “own kind.” 
What he meant was that the 
people who I’d surround 
myself with would all be 
Asian, a stark contrast 
to my high school best 
friends. My high school 
friends were made up of 
a handful of white boys and 
one Vietnamese girl, all 
within a high school class 
of 450 where I could count 
all the Asian students on 
my hands. I didn’t believe 
him at all. However, as 
parents often are, he ended 
up being right, for the most 
part. I still believe that 
friendship isn’t something 
that you can force. My high 
school best friends are still 
some of my best friends 
today. When it comes to 
being homies, it’s about 

whether you and another 
person click! For me, click!-
ing with somebody else just 
seems to be a lot easier for 
me when I’m with another 
person of color.
At 
the 
core 
of 
any 
good 
relationship 
are 
commonalities, 
whether that be mutual 
experiences, 
upbringings 
or interests. In terms of the 
friendships that I’ve made 
since coming to campus, 
the 
majority 
of 
them 
have formed as a result 
of my involvement with 
Michigan’s 
Vietnamese 
Student 
Association, 
pushing myself into the 
larger 
Asian/Pacific-
Islander 
American 
community as a whole. 
Most of my friends here are 
Vietnamese. We recognize 
that 
a 
shared 
cultural 
understanding 
exists 
between us that is essential 
to how we interact with one 
another. There’s a certain 
level 
of 
comfort 
that 
pervades my interactions 

with these individuals—it 
comes with not having to 
explain certain references 
or already understanding 
the 
things 
that 
one 
another may figuratively 
and literally bring to the 
table (see: nước mắm, or 
fish sauce, for example). 
We click! a little easier. 
That doesn’t mean that 
we 
are 
only 
aware 
of 
what makes us similar. 
What is more important 
is that we remain open-
minded. Comfort should 
definitely exist within any 
relationship, but what I 
cherish more is the ability 
to learn from our own 
unique experiences with 
and 
beyond 
those 
who 
share our backgrounds.
Ever 
since 
I 
can 
remember, I’ve introduced 
myself to others as half-
Vietnamese 
and 
half-
Chinese. I am fully aware 
that my perspective is not 
the same as those who may 
be Asian, Black or Latinx. 
Despite these differences, 

I’ve 
found 
a 
sense 
of 
unspoken 
solidarity 
among my peers of color. 
We 
don’t 
homogenize 
our identities as “others,” 
rather we value the unique 
spaces that we occupy as 
individuals 
within 
our 
own 
communities 
and 
among people of color as 
a whole. I believe that 
we tend to click! more 
often 
because 
we 
are 
open 
to 
listening 
and 
learning and speaking out 
about how our identities 
matter. We click! because 
we’re 
down 
for 
new 
experiences 
without 
judgment or condescension 
or 
tokenization. 
We click! because we know 
that 
our 
identities 
are 
distinct and diverse and 
we know not to treat them 
with anything less than 
the utmost respect. When 
my dad said that I would 
stick to my own kind, I 
don’t think that’s entirely 
true.
We just, y’know...click!

Throughout 
most 
of 
elementary 
school, 
my 
parents and I lived in a tiny 
one-bed, 
one-bath 
unit 
tucked away on the top floor 
of a house. My parents and 
I often took turns sleeping 
on the floor, since there was 
only one bed, and only room 
for two; it was a space I often 
felt ashamed of, a place I 
never invited my friends over 
to, a place I pushed away in 
the recesses of my memories.
I write this because while 
my parents and I now belong 
to the middle class, there was 
a time when we didn’t — and 
this low-income situation is 

a lived experience for many 
Asian Americans as well. It 
isn’t often talked about in 
the media, and I myself have 
only recently begun to be 
more aware of the economic 
disparity within this large 
group of non-homogenous 
people 
we 
call 
Asian 
Americans. One definitive 
reason for this is a socially 
constructed pervasive myth: 
the model minority myth.
The myth posits that Asian 
Americans are the “model” 
group that all other minority 
groups 
should 
aspire 
to. 
We’re supposedly smart and 
hard-working, 
and 
those 
two characteristics should 
allow us to achieve the 
American dream and become 
successful 
and 
wealthy. 

Nevermind the fact that the 
myth was created by white 
people to drive a wedge 
between Asian American and 
Black communities during 
the 
civil 
rights 
era; 
nevermind the fact that it 
was used by white people to 
regain favor with Japanese 
Americans 
and 
Japan 
after WWII and Japanese 
internment camps. The myth 
not only perpetuates divisive, 
harmful stereotypes against 
other minority groups, but it 
also pushes a large amount of 
Asian American struggles to 
dark corners—namely, those 
of low socioeconomic status.
Asian Americans earn the 
highest annual income out 
of any group in America—
including white Americans. 

But Asian Americans also 
have the highest income 
gap between those who make 
the most and those who 
make the least. And those 
who make the least tend to be 
the most forgotten or looked-
over in the Asian American 
community: 
Cambodians, 
Laotians, 
Burmese, 
and 
Hmong (these ethnic groups, 
not coincidentally, would also 
be harmed by the removal of 
affirmative action, though 
that’s a different story for 
another time).
Moreover, though Asian 
Americans have the highest 
rate of poverty in New York 
City, 
they 
received 
1.4% 
of the city’s social service 
funds over a thirteen-year 
period—again, 
much 
of 

this is attributed to the 
myths, since there is a lack 
of awareness about these 
economic struggles. Age and 
immigration 
background 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in the income disparities 
within the Asian American 
community too, as those who 
are older and had to flee their 
countries as refugees tend to 
be lower-income.
There is a multitude of 
successful Asian Americans 
out there, and I don’t mean to 
discredit their stories, or the 
fact that Asian Americans 
do own a lot of wealth 
in this country. But we 
shouldn’t forget the fact that 
these statistics are a lived 
reality for numerous low-
income 
Asian 
Americans, 

who are often overlooked 
in an already overlooked 
minority group (though that 
is beginning to change). I 
don’t mean to speak for the 
low-income Asian American 
community, because I am 
no longer low-income and 
our experiences will never 
be the same across the 
board (we are, after all, not a 
monolithic group). But with 
the recent success of a movie 
that focuses on crazy rich 
Asians, it’s important not just 
to stress Hollywood media 
representation, but to look at 
more concerning struggles. 
We cannot forget or overlook 
those within our community 
who are low-income and are 
left behind because of the 
model minority myth.

O

ver 
spring 
break, 
I 
met with my former 
classmates 
from 
a 
coalition 
of 
17 
international 
high schools around the world, 
schools built on the basis of a 
global 
education 
movement 
to unite people, nations and 
cultures for world peace. Our 
school 
breeds 
feminists 
and 
social 
justice 
advocates 
who 
engage in leadership for positive 
change. I presumed this diverse, 
socially aware group would hold 
a constructive discussion about 
the tricky topic of sexual violence. 
But I was egregiously disappointed 
when I was the only one — in a 
subgroup of five individuals — who 
expressed a dissenting opinion 
regarding the statement “rape is 
still sex.”
If we are truly — and not 
just 
fashionably 
— 
dedicated 
to combating rape culture and 
victim blaming, we have to stop 
manipulating language to equate 
rape with sex. In 2017, a New 
York Times letter emphasized 
the necessity to stop connecting 
rape and sex in order to prevent 
the perpetrators from framing 
the dialogue in this way. So it’s 
crucial for all of us to sort out 
the terminology and devise a 
productive lexicon to talk about 
rape and sexual assault.
First, we need to dispense 
the myopic mentality that cites 
simplistic 
biological 
notions 
to conclude rape is sex. In the 
biological 
definition, 
sexual 
intercourse, also called coitus 
or copulation, (but not “sex”), 
is a reproductive act in which 
“the male reproductive organ ... 
enters the female reproductive 
tract.” This definition itself is 
derived from a heteronormative 
understanding, 
and 
is 
specific only to heterosexual, 
reproductive aspects in animals 
and 
humans. 
It 
precludes 
the social and psychological 
implications 
of 
all 
sexual 
relationships and is insufficient 
to envelop all the acts we consider 
sex and all the acts criminalized 
as rape by law.
In reality, when we use the 
word “sex” in our social circles, we 
don’t mean mindless penetration 
or only penetration. We associate 
sex with sexual pleasure and 
intimacy — commonly between 
two 
individuals 
regardless 
of gender. Famous memes on 
mainstream media today, stating: 
“Yeah sex is cool but …” reflect a 
general consensus in society that 
sex is an act that is supposed to 
feel good for all parties involved. 
While the Shakespearean era 
was greatly influenced by it, 
today’s hookup culture sells 
sex as a need-based commodity 
that fulfills sexual desires of 
all participants. And rape and 
sexual assault are not relatable 
to the universal meaning of sex 
because they do not include all 
participants’ sexual needs but 
rather involve one abuser and 
victim.
So to those who say rape is 

“still sex,” your vocabulary must 
be so inadequate that the term 
“sex” 
serves 
two 
polarizing 
sentiments: sexual gratification 
and violation of a human being. 
The 
physical 
and 
emotional 
violence, in addition to the lack 
of consent, renders the act an 
entirely 
different, 
negative 
concept called rape. But this does 
not mean “rape is non-consensual 
sex,” and thus sex. That short-
sighted perception posits an act 
without consent and an act with 
enthusiastic consent to mean 
the same thing — obfuscating 
the necessary lines marked by 
legal systems to distinguish 
the treachery that endangers 
individuals.
When people have “consensual 
sex,” they don’t narrate, “Yesterday, 
I had some consensual sex.” We say 
“I had sex with someone,” because 
implicit in “having” sex is consent, 
so the term non-consensual sex 
itself is an oxymoron. We have 
been highlighting the importance 
of consent because it is a part of 
sex, not an outlier. The fact of the 
matter is that without consent, 
including victim incapacitation 
and 
coercion, 
it’s 
not 
“non-
consensual sex,” “bad sex” or 
“sex” of any kind. It is rape and 
sexual assault — abusive behavior 
penalized by jurisdictions.
The U.S. legal definition was 
reformed by the Department of 
Justice in 2012 to include victims 
and perpetrators of all genders, not 
just women being raped by men. It 
now states: “The penetration, no 
matter how slight, of the vagina or 
anus with any body part or object, 
or oral penetration by a sex organ 
of another person, without the 
consent of the victim.” Though the 
law does not explicitly mention 
the act of “sex,” I argue that by 
highlighting lack of consent in 
the definition, the law presumes 
the presence of consent in having 
sex — which is a legal act. Without 
consent, the law criminalizes the 
act as rape and our society must 
not counter-productively distort 
this understanding. 
Yet, my multinational peers 
in 
London 
argued 
that 
my 
legal 
argument 
“only 
applies 
to the United States.” So let’s 
look at legislation in the United 
Kingdom. It states: “Rape: A 
person (A) commits an offence if 
he intentionally penetrates the 
vagina, anus or mouth of another 
person (B) with his penis; B does 
not consent to the penetration 
…” The law assumes there is 
consent when the act is legal, 
thereby demonstrating the innate 
difference between sex and the 
crime of rape. So this argument 
“rape is not sex” is not specific to 
a nation and does not stem from 
right or left politics.
This is about common sense. 
When a thief steals someone’s 
jewelry, people don’t say they 
borrowed it without permission. 
If you argue rape is “non-
consensual sex” and “still sex,” 
you should logically say robbing a 
bank is “non-consensual loan, so 

still a loan.” This statement sounds 
like you’re trying to explain the 
criminal’s skewed point of view. 
So we must recognize that while 
rape may be received as sex to a 
perpetrator, it is not. To a victim, 
it is a gross breach of their bodily 
autonomy and personal agency, 
which is why sexual violence 
is considered a human rights 
violation that should never be 
confused with sex.
The University of Michigan’s 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center 
has 
emphasized the dangers of this 
misguided 
path, 
stating 
“By 
framing sexualized violence as 
about sex and not about violence 
we focus on the perpetrator’s 
narrative and not the survivor’s. 
Focusing on the perpetrator’s 
narrative leads society to blame 
the victim and to not hold the 
perpetrator 
accountable 
for 
their actions.” In other words, 
associating rape with sex silences 
the victims’ traumatic experience 
with empathy for the perpetrator, 
which is as far from “listening to 
survivors” as a response could 
possibly can be. Survivors get 
to choose the terminology to 
talk about their horror, and a 
society does not get to sugarcoat 
the 
allegations 
against 
their 
perpetrators with the troubling 
oxymoron of “non-consensual 
sex.”
So in the future, reporting 
on disgraced Hollywood mogul 
Harvey Weinstein should stop 
recycling 
the 
words 
of 
the 
accused, such as his attorney 
stating that he: “...has maintained 
that he has never engaged in non-
consensual sex with anyone.” It 
should clearly state that he: “...
denied allegations of rape and 
sexual assault,” because those are 
the claims under investigation 
and trial. Public safety advisory 
emails should not report rape 
as “forced her to engage in non-
consensual sex.” How can one 
“engage” 
in 
something 
they 
haven’t even consented to? This 
crude 
participatory 
language 
is counterintuitive and negates 
the perversity of rapists. It fuels 
the persisting problem: When it 
comes to sexual violence, society 
inherently listens to perpetrators, 
not victims. 
It is urgent to judiciously 
frame our advocacy on victim 
blaming 
around 
the 
victim’s 
narrative. Many survivors don’t 
report their atrocities and when 
they do, they still bear the blame. 
How can we expect it to change 
when individuals who receive 
the most eye-opening education 
continue to say rape is still sex? 
From now on, I hope to never 
hear that preposterous statement, 
especially from young intellectuals 
who have the privilege of using 
their knowledge to implement 
productive dialogue. Words always 
matter, so choose them wisely.

It’s not too late to help Puerto Rico
E

arlier 
this 
week, 
the 
protracted 
controversy 
over President Donald 
Trump’s 
administration’s 
response to Hurricane Maria 
burst back into the limelight with 
a new conflict over federal aid in 
Puerto Rico. Still reeling from the 
devastating damage of Hurricane 
Maria, the people of Puerto Rico 
are in desperate need of federal 
disaster relief. As loyal American 
citizens, the people of Puerto Rico 
have every right to assistance 
from the federal government to 
get back on their feet.
Once again, however, an issue 
that should bridge the political 
divide has fallen victim to our 
toxic partisan politics. A GOP 
disaster 
relief 
measure 
that 
would have provided $14.2 billion 
in 
much 
needed 
emergency 
aid to Puerto Rico, including 
$703 million for Medicaid and 
nutrition assistance, failed to 
advance in the Senate this week. 
Senate 
Democrats 
opposed 
the measure, citing inadequate 
funding to deal with the crisis. 
Meanwhile, Trump has also 
resisted calls for further federal 
aid to Puerto Rico, accusing the 
island’s leaders of incompetence 
and corruption.
The ongoing back and forth 
in Washington over who is to 
blame for Puerto Rico’s woes 
is a distressing illustration of 
what’s wrong in America today. 
Our leaders, on both sides, are 
hurriedly attempting to seize 
the narrative on this crisis for 
political benefit. All the while, 
the 
people 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
continue to suffer from a lack of 
action, discarded as props in the 
broader political battle engulfing 
America. We cannot continue to 
allow Washington to abdicate 
its responsibility to help the 
American citizens of Puerto Rico 
any longer. Instead, we must apply 
pressure on our representatives 
to provide robust aid. 
Hurricane 
Maria, 
which 
struck Puerto Rico in September 
2017, is the deadliest storm to 
hit the United States since 1900. 
Most of the carnage inflicted 
by Maria occurred in the six 
months following the storm, 
not initial impact. After an 
initial reported death toll of 64, 

a study by researchers from the 
Milken Institute School of Public 
Health at George Washington 
University, 
commissioned 
by 
the Puerto Rican government, 
found 2,975 excess deaths in 
the six months after the storm. 
In those six months following 
Maria, the researchers found a 
mortality rate 22 percent higher 
than would be expected without 
the storm. The death toll in 
the months after Maria was 
particularly pronounced among 
the most vulnerable Puerto Rican 
populations. Those living in the 
island’s poorest municipalities 
had a startlingly- high 60-percent 
elevated risk of death while 
older, male Puerto Ricans had a 
35-percent elevated risk of dying.
While 
more 
research 
is 
needed on this catastrophe, it’s 
evident the bungled government 
response, both federal and local, 
led to the preventable deaths of 
so many Puerto Ricans after the 
storm. While FEMA emergency 
workers did heroic work on the 
ground to save lives, not nearly 
enough resources were directed 
to Puerto Rico in the days after 
Maria. A study by the BMJ Journal 
found the federal government 
was far slower in its response to 
Maria than comparable Category 
4 storms in the same time period. 
Within nine days of the disaster, 
victims of Hurricane Harvey in 
Texas and Hurricane Irma in 
Florida received $141.8 million 
and $92.8 million from FEMA to 
recover, respectively. Victims of 
Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico 
received only $6.2 million from 
FEMA in the same time period.
The 
lackluster 
response 
from FEMA and the federal 
government had a direct impact 
on the well-being of the Puerto 
Rican people. A prime example is 
when over 20,000 pallets of water 
were brought in by FEMA and 
remained sitting on the tarmac 
of an airport in Puerto Rico for 
months on end while Puerto 
Ricans were forced to resort to 
drinking unfiltered spring water. 
It’s unacceptable Puerto Ricans 
were required to put their health 
at risk by drinking potentially 
unsafe water while 20,000 pallets 
of water were sitting on the island 
either tainted by heat or unused. 

Both FEMA and local authorities 
shoulder the blame for this 
egregious act of mismanagement 
and poor communication. The 
heroic emergency work of FEMA 
and local authorities on the 
ground to save lives immediately 
after the storm’s landfall doesn’t 
make these appalling mistakes 
excusable.
The inequality in federal 
response between catastrophic 
storms on the mainland and 
Puerto Rico is abhorrent. The 
people of Puerto Rico are equal 
citizens of the United States 
and ought to be treated as such. 
When our nation has asked the 
Puerto Rican people to fight 
for our freedoms, they have 
answered the call resoundingly. 
More 
than 
200,000 
Puerto 
Ricans have served bravely in 
the U.S. Armed Forces in every 
conflict since World War I. We 
in the continental United States 
cannot turn our backs on our 
fellow Americans in Puerto Rico 
in their time of need. One of the 
many reasons our country is so 
exceptional is because we rally 
around each other during times 
of adversity. Puerto Ricans are 
very much a part of that tradition. 
Our government’s response to 
Hurricane Maria must reflect 
that.
Going forward, it’s evident 
that 
an 
improved 
federal 
government 
presence 
can 
make all the difference for the 
health and well-being of the 
Puerto Rican people. With the 
failure of the disaster relief 
package for Puerto Rico in the 
Senate this week, the Puerto 
Rican 
people 
continue 
to 
wait for federal assistance on 
matters of life or death such 
as nutrition and health care. 
While nearly two years have 
passed since Hurricane Maria, 
our commitment to our fellow 
American citizens in Puerto 
Rico cannot wane. It’s past time 
for our leaders in Washington 
to put partisanship aside and 
demonstrate that commitment 
with continued disaster relief.

T

here is a disconnect on 
climate change between 
Democratic 
voters’ 
priorities 
and 
the 
attention 
it is given on a national level. 
According 
to 
a 
recent 
Pew 
Research 
Center 
poll, 
voters 
ranked the environment as their 
third most important issue. But 
that enthusiasm was not apparent 
during 
the 
2018 
midterms, 
where Democrats seldom talked 
about climate change, instead 
choosing to focus on health care, 
the Republican tax plan and 
corruption in President Donald 
Trump’s administration.
I have been wondering for a 
long time when a Democrat would 
run for president primarily on 
climate change. In 2016, national 
media gave it little airtime, and 
candidate Hillary Clinton did not 
prioritize the stark differences 
between herself and President 
Donald Trump on the issue.
A possible explanation for the 
recent lack of national climate 
change conversation is the partisan 
nature of climate politics. The 
same Pew poll highlighted that 
climate change is the issue with the 
largest partisan prioritization gap. 
Another possibility is that climate 
change conversations seem too 
apocalyptic to be inspiring. Or 
perhaps many Americans think 
dealing 
with 
climate 
change 
means losing jobs.
Jay 
Inslee, 
governor 
of 
Washington and current 2020 
candidate for the Democratic 
nomination, 
believes 
those 
obstacles can be overcome. By 
running as the climate candidate, 
he is trying to exploit the 
disconnect between the extent 
Democratic 
voters 
prioritize 
climate change and the attention 
candidates give it on the national 
stage. Coming from Washington, 
which 
has 
a 
sizable 
rural 
Republican population, he thinks 
he can make climate change an 
issue Republicans can get behind. 
And instead of prophesying doom 
as many climate advocates do, 
he is explicitly pushing a hopeful 

message, one centered on the 
potential jobs a transition to clean 
energy brings.
Though 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Democratic field also calls for 
action on climate change, they 
do not make it a priority — it is 
just another on the laundry list of 
agenda items they have once in 
office. For Inslee, climate change 
should be the next president’s top 
priority.
Inslee’s message is especially 
significant 
because, 
for 
Democrats, prioritization shapes 
policy. In 2008, then-candidate 
Barack Obama had an ambitious 
legislative agenda, but since he 
prioritized the Affordable Care 
Act and the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act, he was 
unable to expend more political 
capital 
passing 
comprehensive 
immigration 
reform 
or 
his 
cap-and-trade plan for carbon 
emissions. 
If 
climate 
action 
proposals are just another item 
on the long list of policies 2020 
candidates need to prove their 
progressive 
credibility, 
I 
am 
skeptical we will see meaningful 
change.
Inslee’s bet does not seem to 
be paying off. While it is early in 
the campaign and Inslee does not 
have high national visibility, he 
has not been polling higher than 
one percent and often does not 
even appear in the top 12. He is 
not even the most popular issue-
based candidate — entrepreneur 
Andrew Yang’s campaign based 
on universal basic income has 
been about as successful so far 
(and he certainly has more of a cult 
following).
Inslee’s low polling is not a 
condemnation 
for 
prioritizing 
climate action on the national 
level, but it underscores the need to 
integrate climate into other issues 
Democrats are passionate about.
In that capacity, he is losing 
out to the other, faceless climate 
candidate of the 2020 Democratic 
primary — the Green New Deal, 
which is the proposed framework 
for fighting climate change and 

socio-economic inequality from 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, 
D-Mass. 
Despite, 
or 
maybe 
because of, the right’s vilification 
of the proposal, it has polled well 
across the political spectrum, 
with more likely voters expressing 
support than opposition (including 
71-percent 
of 
Democrats). 
Historically, Democratic climate 
policy has focused on wonky 
policies 
like 
cap-and-trade 
proposals or carbon taxes. When 
these 
were 
the 
headliners, 
voters 
were 
unenthusiastic, 
which limited how intensely the 
Obama administration wanted 
to put themselves behind climate 
legislation, according to David 
Axelrod, President Obama’s senior 
adviser. These efforts also ignored 
the ways in which climate change 
will first impact marginalized 
communities.
Even though Inslee’s climate 
messaging is more nuanced 
than the climate politics of the 
past, by branding himself as 
the climate candidate, he has 
sidelined economic and social 
justice issues important to the 
Democratic base. And it does not 
help that Inslee, a 68-year-old 
white man, looks like the people 
who have often advocated for 
technocratic climate policies.
The recent report issued by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change tells the world 
that we must drastically reduce 
our global carbon emissions by 
2030 in order to mitigate the 
worst impacts of climate change. 
That requires the United States 
gets on board and prioritizes 
climate 
change. 
The 
Green 
New Deal’s popularity, and Jay 
Inslee campaign’s lack thereof, 
proves that we cannot talk about 
climate change by itself, but 
that it must be fully integrated 
into other efforts voters are 
passionate about.

Monday, April 8, 2019 — 5A

When you walked out your 
door 
this 
morning, 
it 
was 
probably the first thing you 
smelled: spring. It’s a sweet 
ripeness in the air that contrasts 
with 
the 
smokier, 
earthier 
scent of colder days weeks 
prior. It triggers an immediate 
emotional response that, at 
least in spring’s earliest days, is 
impossible to ignore.
It makes us more energetic, 
happier, 
louder. 
The 
Diag 
is 
bright, 
crowded 
and 
unnavigable. Palmer and Elbel 
are ridden with runners and 
frisbee-ers. The library feels 
just that much brighter. Spring’s 
early days have always been 
injected with this kind of energy 
and each time they roll around, 
I feel great nostalgia for the 
places I’ve been and the person I 
was the past times they’ve made 
their visit.
This 
year, 
nostalgia 
has 
manifested itself in a great 
appreciation for the music of 
my childhood: Beck, Gorillaz, 
Moby and Oasis, to name a 
few. These are artists my mom 
would play on our household 
stereo 
(essentially 
a 
round 

boombox with CD and cassette 
capabilities) back in 2005.
Beck’s “Que’ Onda Guero” 
from his 2005 album Guero is a 
bouncy Mexican-infused funk 
anthem. I only found it again 
while going song by song through 
the album, which I recognized 
from seeing its hard-copy form 
as a child. Gorillaz has a couple 
well-known hits from this time: 
“Clint Eastwood” off their 2001 
Gorillaz and “Feel Good Inc.” off 
their 2005 Demon Days.
What’s 
really 
excited 
me 
lately though have been lesser-
known bops like “Rock the 
House” 
and 
“Dirty 
Harry.” 
Moby’s “Extreme Ways” will 
always be a post-9/11 era period 
piece for me, especially given 
that my mom works in news 
research. Oasis’s (What’s the 
Story) Morning Glory? is another 
cover I instantly recognized 
when Spotify suggested “Some 
Might Say.” Oasis’s sound — 
though influenced by a lineage 
of English rock from the Beatles 
to the Clash and beyond — is 
incredibly recognizable, even 
if all you know as a University 
student is the “Wonderwall” 
frat remix.
I’m still able to associate 
vivid memories with some of 
these sounds from the deepest 

chasms of my memory. They 
make me remember the one time 
my whole neighborhood’s power 
went out, and my parents and I 
burned candles and listened to 
our CD collection as we played 
Go Fish (this was, in retrospect, 
the first time I understood the 
ambience of candle lighting). 
They 
make 
me 
remember 
making paper maché volcanoes 
with the Beck lyric “make their 
dreams out of paper maché” 
standing out in my head. They 
make me remember dancing 
with my best friend Nikita on 
a gym bench shouting, “I’m 
happy, I’m feeling glad, I got 
sunshine, in a bag!”
Now, looking back, it is a 
bit funny that I had a vague 
understanding of some of these 
explicit themes at such a young 
age. It doesn’t matter if you were 
listening to Bruce Springsteen 
or Biggie, though. The tunes 
of your childhood still have a 
transportive quality that no 
other 
music 
you’ll 
discover 
in the future ever will. If you 
haven’t recently, go back to 
those first sounds that defined 
your idea of what music was. 
Walking on a sunny spring day, 
you’ll hardly feel like you’ve 
gone anywhere since the first 
time you heard them play.

Looking back, listening 
fondly in the springtime

BEN VASSAR
Daily Arts Writer

A couple months ago, I 
wrote a column about the 
French rap sensation PNL. 
While I didn’t anticipate 
writing 
another, 
recent 
events have made me want to 
revisit the duo, their music 
and why they are a national 
sensation 
in 
their 
home 
country in a way few artists 
have ever been.
To recap the essentials 
of the story, PNL consists 
of two brothers: Tarik and 
Nabil Andrieu (Ademo and 
NOS respectively) hailing 
from 
Corbeil-Essonnes, 
a 
suburb of Paris. On April 5, 
they released their third 
studio album, Deux Frères 
(Two Brothers), after a 
period of three years. 
The level of anticipation 
was seeminly at unseen 
heights, 
with 
prolific 
French music journalist 
Mehdi 
Maïzi 
jokingly 
remarking 
on 
Twitter 
that 
these 
levels 
of 
national unity were only 
last 
seen 
during 
the 
World Cup (in which the 
French were victorious). 
The announcement came 
just a week ago with the 
release of a new single 
“Au DD.”
“Au 
DD,” 
also 
the 
first track of the new 
album, 
is 
classic 
PNL. 
Braggadocious, 
aggressive, 
with a memorable chorus, 
it reached more than ten 
million views in two days 
and became the first French 
single to reach the Spotify 
Global Top 30. The single 
was 
accompanied 
by 
a 
truly stunning music video, 
especially notable for a group 
that was already known for 
its 
ambitious, 
cinematic 
videos. The brothers became 
the first group to film a video 
on top of the Eiffel Tower, 
also transforming it into a 
trap house in the process. 
The video features several 
stunning drone shots and 
the brothers strut around 
with a sense of victory. The 
Eiffel Tower, the most iconic 
of French symbols, showed 

up often in previous videos 
such as the one for their 
2016 single “DA,” not just 
as a symbol of their beloved 
Paris (often referred to as 
“Paname” as well), but also 
perhaps a Paris that was 
far 
and 
inaccessible 
for 
two Muslim boys from the 
troubled suburbs. But now, 
just as they have conquered 
the French youth spirit, they 
have conquered La Tour 
Eiffel. Drake perhaps did it 
first in Toronto’s CN Tower, 
but unlike Drake, PNL is 
one of those rare artists 
(think Springsteen or Jay Z) 
that can imbue their music 
with a convincing sense of 
grandeur.

Deux Frères as a whole 
is, just as “Au DD,” a victory 
lap, but it also offers a more 
vulnerable and confessional 
PNL. 
“A 
l’ammoniaque” 
(“With 
ammonia”), 
one 
of 
the 
most 
understated 
tracks PNL has ever made, 
deals with a bitter love and 
general 
regret 
for 
their 
past 
life. 
Ademo 
sings, 
“Inch’Allah, 
Inch’Allah, 
Inch’Allah/ Que Dieu nous 
pardonne pardonne pour nos 
crasses / Pour notre manque 
de comprehension / Evenrs 
l’Homme et sa putain d’race” 
(“Insh’Allah 
Insh’Allah 
Insh’allah / May God forgive 
us for our dirty tricks and 
our lack of understanding of 
man and his fucking race”). 
On the standout conclusion 
“La Misère est si belle” 

(“Misery 
is 
beautiful”), 
the brothers reflect on the 
difficulty of their lives. The 
pair grew up without their 
mother and a criminal father 
who they were close to but 
was often absent as well. 
Ademo in particular reflects 
about his nagging loneliness 
and difficulty with even 
sleeping 
peacefully, 

referring to himself with his 
real name as well.
Deux Frères is also the most 
diverse albums the duo has 
made up to this point. Songs 
like “Au DD” are familiar 
to any PNL fan, but songs 
like the aforementioned “A 
L’ammoniaque” and “Hasta 
la 
vista” 
are 
a 
distinct 
departure of the likes of 
2016’s 
“Bené.” 
The 
latter has a particular 
Maghrébien 
(North 
African) influence, with 
some 
labelling 
it 
as 
“Raïggeton,” refrencing 
“Raï,” a type of Algerian 
popular music and the 
immensely 
popular 
Reggaeton 
of 
Daddy 
Yankee, 
Nicky 
Jam 
and 
others. 
“91’s” 
is 
the funkiest and most 
danceable PNL track to 
date. 
The 
production 
value and diversity is 
world 
class 
on 
Deux 
Frères, which is notable 
since that is one aspect 
of 
their 
American 
counterparts that many 
foreign 
hip-hop 
albums 
rarely reach.
PNL, in a manner similar 
to their compatriots Daft 
Punk, have reached a level of 
popularity in their country 
without any kind of external 
marketing, 
interviews 
or 
engagement. As they say, 
all you need to know about 
them is in their music. Even 
now, they remain completely 
independent, 
with 
every 
aspect of their work, from 
the writing to the artistic 
design, being completed by 
people they have known and 
trusted for a while. They 
live their refrain of “Que 
La Famille,” and I hope that 
audiences around the world 
will 
eventually 
come 
to 
know and love them as much 
as I do.

MARVEL STUDIOS
The Marvel Cinematic 
Universe ranked, part two

In the run-up to “Avengers: 
Endgame,” I’m running down 
every movie and TV show the 
MCU has ever put out and 
ranking them based on how 
well they tell their stories with 
the means available to them. 
This is part two of a four part 
series.

33. “Marvel’s Cloak and 
Dagger”: Season one (2018)
Like so many MCU TV 
shows, “Cloak and Dagger” 
coasts for as long as it can on 
its leads before conjuring up 
anything resembling narrative 

momentum. 
Well-built 
characters are, of course, the 
most important thing, but so 
often Marvel applies the same 
logic to TV shows as they do 
to movies — if the characters 
suit up by the end of their first 
outing, it’s fine. The problem 
is a season of TV is a long 
time to go without the reason 
people tuned in, so you end up 
with a show called “Cloak and 
Dagger” with a glaring lack of 
Cloak and Dagger.
32. “Thor” (2011)
There may be no MCU 
film as uneven in quality as 
“Thor.” On the one hand, 
it’s a character-driven story 
in which the Thor’s arc is 
intrinsically tied to how the 

plot progresses. On the other, 
that story is about as generic 
a hero’s journey as Marvel has 
yet put out. The Asgardians 
are 
further 
examples 
of 
Marvel’s 
perfect 
casting. 
The human characters are 
bland, 
forgettable 
and 
a 
waste of superb actors. It’s 
deeply funny in some scenes. 
Elsewhere, it falls flat on its 
face.
31. 
“Marvel’s 
Agents 
of 
S.H.I.E.L.D.”: 
Season 
one 
(2013-2014)
Of all the miracles the MCU 
has pulled off, the first season 
of “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” is 
one of the most impressive. 
The first 16 episodes are a 
mess 
of 
cliché 
characters 

matched 
with 
boring 
storylines, a show trying to 
justify its own existence in 
a universe defined by its big 
screen outings. Then, in the 
final 
moments 
of 
episode 
17 everything changes, and 
“S.H.I.E.L.D.,” as if by magic, 
becomes tightly-written and 
paced, constantly pushing its 
characters to new, exciting 
places.
30. 
“Marvel’s 
The 
Defenders”: Season one (2017)
Over two years, Marvel’s 
Netflix 
shows 
laid 
the 
groundwork for their small-
screen 
answer 
to 
“The 
Avengers,” and when it finally 
dropped, it was met with a 
resounding, “Sure.” There’s a 
certain joy in watching these 
characters come together, but 
the Hand had been boring 
through the individual shows 
and 
is 
no 
different 
here. 
I’ll grant that the twist at 
the 
three-quarter 
mark 
is 
shocking, but even that only 
serves to make everything 
more boring. The fact that 
another Disney property, “The 
Last Jedi,” pulled off a similar 
twist much more successfully 
that same year doesn’t help.
29. “Marvel’s Agent Carter”: 
Season one (2015)
It’s tempting to say “Give 
Hayley Atwell her own movie,” 
and leave it at that, but that 
would be a disservice to a 
pretty decent season of TV. 
In contrast to the lackluster 
second season, the first season 
of “Agent Carter” gives its star 
much more to do by taking 
place directly after the events 
of “The First Avenger” and 
showing her working through 
her grief while also having to 
deal with a postwar spy story. 
That story is still handicapped 
by its need to constantly tie 
itself to the wider MCU, but it 
was a promising solo debut for 
the character.

28. 
“Marvel’s 
Agents 
of 
S.H.I.E.L.D.”: 
Season 
two 
(2014-2015)
The biggest challenge the 
second 
season 
of 
“Agents 
of S.H.I.E.L.D.” faced was 
translating the magic of the 
last five episodes of its first 
season into a full 22 episode 
run. To an extent, it works, 
thanks mostly to an expanded 
ensemble and some interesting 
narrative developments, but 
there’s also a good deal of 
growing 
pains 
on 
display 
in the pacing. Given where 
“S.H.I.E.L.D.” 
would 
go, 
though, that’s easily forgiven.
27. “Marvel’s Daredevil”: 
Season two (2016)
The 
tight 
focus 
of 
the 
first season of “Daredevil” 
is replaced by a bisected 
structure 
where 
anything 
and everything dealing with 
Jon Bernthal’s Punisher is 
great, forcing Matt Murdock 
to reckon with his actions 
in a way very much in line 
with the series’ core themes. 
Then there’s the other half, 
centered on Elektra and the 
Hand, which exists solely to 
build up to “The Defenders.”
26. “Doctor Strange” (2016)
“Doctor 
Strange” 
is 
essentially a more visually 
impressive version of “Iron 
Man,” but it’s saved not just 
by those vaunted effects but 
by the insane talent of its 
cast. Benedict Cumberbatch 
absolutely 
owns 
the 
title 
role from start to finish, 
embodying 
Strange’s 
razor 
sharp 
wit 
perfectly. 
Even 
better, though controversial, 
is Tilda Swinton as the Ancient 
One, whose final scene ranks 
as one of the best and most 
beautiful in the MCU.
25. “Ant-Man and the Wasp” 
(2018)
If “Ant-Man and the Wasp” 
has a story to tell, it’s lost 
on me in the barrage of car 

chases, heel turns and one-
liners. But in a way, that 
makes it the perfect movie 
to show why Marvel movies 
work even when they stumble. 
From beginning to end, this 
is a movie that finds its life in 
its characters, and Marvel’s 
willingness to focus on them 
even in the aftermath of 
something like “Infinity War” 
is a breath of fresh air.
24. “Ant-Man” (2015)
More famous for the drama 
during its production, “Ant-
Man” is nevertheless the most 
immediately 
accessible 
the 
MCU has been since “Iron 
Man.” Again, it’s all centered 
on the character of Scott Lang 
and builds his character and 
his relatable struggle before it 
puts him in his supersuit and 
sends him off on his pseudo-
science-fueled 
heist. 
What 
follows is a stylish blast, 
but it’s all built upon the 
foundation of the characters.
23. 
“Marvel’s 
Agents 
of 
S.H.I.E.L.D.”: 
Season 
five 
(2017–2018)
“Agents 
of 
S.H.I.E.L.D.” 
oversteps 
a 
bit 
with 
an 
admirably 
ambitious 
fifth 
season that sent its characters 
decades 
into 
the 
future. 
A 
handful 
of 
charming 
new 
characters 
and 
Fitz’s 
continued 
struggles 
with 
his own duality are definite 
highlights, 
yet 
after 
their 
return from the future, the 
show seems to be unsure 
of how to proceed with its 
central story, throwing Hydra 
into the mix yet again before 
finally settling on Graviton as 
the season’s Big Bad.

Next week, Marvel turns 
in 
one 
of 
the 
best, 
most 
miraculous seasons of genre TV 
broadcast networks have had 
in years. Meanwhile, a couple 
misunderstood cinematic gems 
get their due.

Priests explores being bad 
on ‘Seduction of Kansas’

ALBUM REVIEW

SISTER POLYGON RECORDS

After 
releasing 
their 
excellent album Nothing Feels 
Natural, it was hard to imagine 
where Priests would take their 
sound. The band masterfully 
demonstrated 
their 
post-punk chops, but 
that genre seems to 
have its limitations. It 
is difficult to navigate 
the 
post-punk 
genre 
and experiment within 
it without crossing back 
into punk or straying 
into 
alternative. 
However, 
with 
The 
Seduction 
of 
Kansas, 
Priests 
have 
totally 
eschewed post-punk in 
favor of a new genre, 
one much less defined, 
one that allows the 
band to full stretch its 
wings.
Priests 
tackles 
more sounds on The 
Seduction 
of 
Kansas 
than most bands will 
over the course of their 
whole 
careers. 
This 
description 
makes 
it 
sound like the Priests is 
trying to do too much, 
but most of these new 
sounds are barely noticeable. 
They 
bubble 
beneath 
the 
surface as the band does its 
thing. When these sounds do 
break through, though, they 
hit hard. Album opener, “Jesus’ 
Son,” is a far cry from anything 
on Nothing Feels Natural. It 
sets the tone for the rest of the 
album, as any opener should. 
Simply put, “Jesus’ Son” sounds 
big, 
clearly 
drawing 
from 
stadium rock. The guitar soars, 
the drums are driving and the 
vocals are sharp, but it’s the 
bass that sets this song apart. 
The bassline makes the song 

infectious and danceable, so 
much so that it’s hard to resist 
the urge to get up and move. 
The lyrics are gnarly and a little 
gross, and that is just how the 
band wants it.
In 
a 
track-by-track 
breakdown of the entire album 
released by Stereogum, the 

band states, “Being bad is 
fun. Think of a villain like 
Cruella de Vil. The villains in 
the movies always have the 
best clothes, they always seem 
the coolest.” The Seduction of 
Kansas certainly does have 
this air about it. The band is 
doing exactly what they want, 
and they’re not afraid to piss 
anyone off in the process. On 
the song “Youtube Sartre,” 
the band takes aim at anyone 
opposed to their beliefs and 
lifestyles, 
particularly 
the 
perpetually-disapproving 
baby boomers. What’s more, 

the song at first sounds like a 
typical rock song, but beneath 
the buzzsaw guitar is a dainty, 
bizarre vibraphone plodding 
along largely unnoticed and 
underappreciated.
Unfortunately, 
after 
“Youtube Sartre,” the album 
begins to feel overly long. The 
songs 
themselves 
are good, but they 
just 
aren’t 
great. 
“I’m 
Clean” 
and 
“Ice 
Cream” 
are 
both quiet, brooding 
songs 
marked 
by 
a bass guitar lead. 
The songs disrupt 
the tone set by the 
record’s first three 
songs. 
The 
album 
picks 
up 
a 
little 
once it hits “Good 
Time Charlie,” one 
of its singles, and 
“68 
Screens,” 
a 
delightfully 
weird 
track highlighted by 
shining synthesizer 
strokes and Priests’s 
own take on hardcore 
gang vocals. Outside 
of these two late 
gems 
though, 
the 
album fails to blow 
any minds. It’s by 
no means bad or 
unenjoyable, but it 
feels like something is missing.
On The Seduction of Kansas, 
Priests finds themselves in 
uncharted 
territory, 
taking 
their post-punk roots places 
they have never been before. 
They explore stadium rock, 
shoegaze, 
dance 
and 
many 
more genres; for the most part, 
it works well and there are 
no abysmal tracks. However, 
some songs fail to impress, 
causing the album to drag at 
times. Despite this, Priests still 
manages to create a fresh and 
enjoyable album that warrants 
several return visits.

If you’ve been listening to 
the radio for the last 15 years, 
there is a good chance that 
you’re familiar with Amos 
Lee’s hit song “Sweet Pea.” 
“Sweet Pea” is a feat in pop 
songwriting: It’s happy, but 
carries with it a tinge of blues 
that colors the tune soulfully, 
making 
the 
track 
more profound and 
caring 
than 
most 
sweet 
love 
songs 
can be. Before last 
week, that’s really 
all I was aware of 
in his discography, 
but boy, I was in 
for a surprise. The 
2006 single is just 
a glimpse into what 
Lee 
can 
really 
do, as he’s made a 
name 
for 
himself 
in 
songwriting 
and soul in the last 
13 years of music. 
His newest record, 
My New Moon, is 
the culmination of 
those years in one 
shining 
record, 
a 
work that weaves 
classic 
romance, 
grit 
and 
soul together in one varied 
pattern. This comes through 
in his live performances, too 
— on Tuesday, Lee’s signature 
soulful charm made its way 
to the Michigan Theater for a 
memorable performance in our 
own Ann Arbor.
Right 
off 
the 
bat, 
the 
audience could bet on the 
night being a good one — 
Lee’s 
opening 
act 
Ethan 
Gruska began the show with 
a collection of songs off of his 
first 
record 
Slowmotionary. 
It makes sense that Gruska 

was chosen to travel with Lee 
across North America for this 
tour, as they both have a similar 
aura of wistful storytelling 
about them. Gruska’s set was 
heavy on guitar and piano and 
primed the audience for what 
would be a two-hour journey 
through Amos Lee’s memory 
and 
heart. 
After 
a 
brief 
intermission, the packed house 
rose to their feet for Lee’s first 
song, a performance of My New 

Moon standout “All You Got Is 
A Song.” The bass blared, and 
Lee’s warm vocals filled the 
theater easily and beautifully, 
setting himself and his band up 
for the night ahead.
For the next two hours, 
Lee made the nearly-sold-out 
Michigan Theater into his 
living room, as comfortable on 
stage as he would be talking 
to an old friend. The musician 
was clearly close with all 
of his bandmates, and even 
shared the spotlight with a 
few of them, creating features 
on songs like “Spirit” and 

“Arms of a Woman.” Through 
this and Lee’s funny banter, 
the show took on a life of its 
own, behaving more like a jam 
session between friends than 
a polished performance. This 
isn’t to say that Lee is less 
than a consummate performer, 
though — it was his ease and 
style on stage that made its 
homey vibe possible in the first 
place. He glided in and out of 
vocal riffs as if they were as 
easy 
as 
breathing, 
floating 
between 
high-tempo jams and 
emotional 
ballads 
without a hitch. My 
first 
impression 
of 
Lee was that of a man 
who had been playing 
music his whole life, 
and wanted everyone 
else to feel how much 
he loved it, too.

More 
than 

anything, 
Lee’s 
performance 
was 
a 
place for him to share 
how life’s tragedies 
(the 
death 
of 
his 
grandparents, the end 
of a relationship) and 
joys (new love, finding 
your groove in this 
world) can make great 
art. His anecdotes and 
jokes between songs carried 
as much weight as the songs 
themselves, often letting the 
audience in on the stories 
behind them. Through Lee’s 
showmanship, the audience 
was able to understand how 
music can color life and allow 
one to get through it at the 
same time — in Amos Lee’s 
darkest times, it was music that 
gave him joy, and when he was 
joyful, it was music that helped 
him to spread his happiness to 
others, creating a patchwork of 
emotion and beauty all present 
in his incomparable voice.

At Michigan Theater, Lee 
finds himself comfortable

TV REVIEW

‘Veep’ remains relevant, 
funny and (kind of) sad

From the time it premiered 
20 years ago on NBC, certain 
people have always wanted to 
believe Washington operated 
like “The West Wing.” They 
wanted 
to 
imagine 
slick, 

educated, 
smooth-talking 
technocrats 
briskly 
walking 
through corridors and “reaching 
across the aisle” to solve the 
problems 
of 
the 
American 
people. Civility and respect are 
the name of the game in this 
fiction. However, if the events of 
the 21st century haven’t already 
cracked this façade, the last few 

years most certainly have. It’s 
clear as day that our political 
reality 
resembles 
Armando 
Iannucci’s biting satire (more 
accurately, 
documentary), 
“Veep” — it’s made up of a bunch 
of narcissistic, power-hungry 
blowhards who couldn’t give 
two shits about you or me.
“Veep,” entering its final 

season, is Iannucci’s second 
crack 
at 
political 
comedy, 
after the British sitcom “The 
Thick of It.” “Veep” preserves 
the vulgarity and cynicism of 
its spiritual predecessor, but 
Iannucci’s great achievement 
is making it feel distinctly 
American. Selina Meyer (Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus, “Seinfeld”), the 
smoothed out yet in some ways 
more despicable version of “The 
Thick of It”’s Malcolm Tucker, is 
back with a vengeance, running 
for president after some soul 
searching.
The premiere is a reassuring 
reminder of how brilliant and 
awful these familiar characters 
are. The unmatched, hapless 
former liaison to Meyer’s office 
turned 
congressman 
Jonah 
Ryan (Timothy Simons, “Ralph 
Breaks the Internet”) is now 
running for president himself. 
Blood-boilingly 
punchable 
as ever, he finds himself in 
somewhat of a scandal when 
the press finds out his wife 
is 
actually 
his 
step-sister, 
although he is adamant that it’s 
not that big of a deal in the first 
place.
Dreyfus’s 
performance 
as 
Meyer continues to be the biggest 
highlight in a show with many. 
She is still incapable of any self-
reflection, remorse or emotion 
other than blatant selfishness. 
She struggles to answer the 

main question posed to her in 
the premiere: Why does she 
want to be president? As usual, 
she tries to come up with some 
of her signature faux-inspiration 
bullshit, but in reality, her only 
reason is because she is adamant 
that it is her damn turn. In 
one of the show’s more tragic 
character arcs, Selina’s daughter 
Catherine (Sarah Sutherland, 
“Chronic”) 
suffers 
from 
postpartum 
depression 
with 

little sympathy from her mother, 
who unsurprisingly refers to her 
baby as “it” and tries to use him 
as a prop as often as possible for 
her own gain. It’s hard to argue 
against the fact that at this 
point, she should probably just 
know better.
It’s pretty much settled that 
Selina’s never going to regain 

what semblance of humanity 
she once had, and it remains 
the same for most of the other 
surrounding characters. Amy 
(Anna Chlumsky, “Halt and 
Catch Fire”), Meyer’s chief of 
staff, is pregnant and Dan (Reid 
Scott, “Venom”) is revealed as 
the father. Dan, the epitome 
of smooth-talking, ruthlessly 
ambitious 
young 
Beltway 
careerist, is as callous as we 
expect, offering to “go Dutch on 
the abortion” even when Amy 
expresses a desire to keep the 
child.
“Veep”’s elite characters 
love calling the American 
people 
“disgusting” 
as 
often as they can, making 
it hilarious and sadly ironic 
when juxtaposed with their 
own rampant bigotry. It’s 
hard to not wonder where 
these 
people’s 
lives 
went 
wrong. Were they always 
mild (or severe) sociopaths, 
or did Washington suck out 
all remaining vestiges of their 
souls? Maybe it’s better if we 
know just how self-serving the 
people we represent us probably 
are. Maybe we can try to change 
things knowing this. Or maybe 
we can just follow the lead of 
Selina Meyer’s chief of staff Ben 
(Kevin Dunn, “True Detective”) 
and drink away from our nine-
cup thermos filled with bourbon 
and Smartwater.

Season 7 Premiere

HBO

Sundays @ 10:30 p.m.


“Can’t break steel.”
All season long, that’s what Michigan’s 

gymnasts have preached. Through injury, 
through tough competition, through 
controversy and a long season of twisting 
and turning and tumbling — you can’t 
break steel. 

Saturday night, the culmination of that 

mentality was put to the test. A day of 
competition in the NCAA Regional Final 
left reigning national champion UCLA 
with a hefty lead and the Wolverines 
in second with a not-so-hefty lead over 
Alabama. 

A quick vault rotation at the end of 

Saturday’s meet left Michigan waiting — 
waiting to see if Alabama would make a 
comeback on beam, waiting to see if its 
lead was big enough, waiting to see if SEC 
beam champion Lexi Graber would score 
a 10.000 on her best event, waiting to see 
if Alabama’s last-ditch effort for a trip to 
Fort Worth would jeopardize a potential 
National Championship appearance. 

For anyone in maize, every second 

of the routine was agonizing. For the 
Crimson, it was gold.

Graber gave everything Alabama 

could have asked her for. Every turn 
was controlled, every toe was pointed, 
every connection was hit. For a team that 
needed a 10.000, having Graber anchor 
was the best possible option.

She dismounted the beam, and all 

eyes, Alabama and Michigan alike, were 
trained on the scoreboards. In neon lights, 
the number flashed on the screen.

9.950. 
The waiting game was over — 

Michigan was going to the NCAA 
Championship. Sam Roy threw her arms 
in the air, Emma McLean hugged Lexi 
Funk (and anyone else she could find) and 
a tearful Olivia Karas was overcome with 
emotion.

“It was a nail-biter. It was one of those 

things that you don’t know until the 
last score comes up,” Karas said. “To be 
honest, I don’t think anyone really knew 
what to expect. You just don’t know with 
scoring, and I didn’t watch any of the 
routines because I was too nervous. But it 
was definitely one of those very raw, ‘Oh 
my god, we did it!’ moments, and you don’t 
get those a lot in life.”

Michigan’s final score of 197.275, a 

thread above Alabama’s 197.225, was built 
up through an evening of heavy scoring 
and intense competition. The all-around 
left Karas and Natalie Wojcik tied with 
Nebraska’s Sienna Crouse at second with 
identical scores of 39.475, which would 
have topped the charts if the Bruins’ Kyla 
Ross wasn’t Kyla Ross.

But she was, and she swept the beam 

and bars rotations with a 10.000 in 
each, along with a 9.950 to tie teammate 
Katelyn Ohashi for floor. 

UCLA rounded out the top-three 

on floor with Gracie Kramer, and if 
you haven’t seen a Gracie Kramer floor 
routine, it’s a completely different breed 
of energetic, passionate gymnastics. The 
Bruins stacked the event, and with top 
placers in every other rotation, they built 
a first-place finish early on that no team 
could replicate. 

That left three teams bidding over one 

ticket to Fort Worth. It was going to be 
tough, a complete battle, for any of the 
three to earn it over the others. 

Cue the motto: “Can’t break steel.”
After Kramer came three Wolverines 

in a nine-way tie for fourth on the floor 
— McLean, Karas and Abby Brenner. No 
Michigan gymnast took an individual 
title from the event like Ross did for the 
Bruins, but each placed high enough to 
rack up points for a tiny, gutsy lead over 
Alabama.

Wojcik did her part, leading the 

Wolverines on beam and barely topping 
Karas’ 9.900 to be the lead scorer for 
Michigan in the event. Lauren Farley 
dominated the bars for the Wolverines, 
earning a 9.875, while three gymnasts — 
McLean, Brenner and Anne Maxim — all 
earned a team-high 9.850 on vault. 

Individually, there were no titles. But 

that’s not what the NCAA Regional Final 
meant to Michigan. 

“It’s incredible,” said Michigan 

coach Bev Plocki. “This team has been 
through a lot, and they say what doesn’t 
kill you only makes you stronger and 

that’s sort of the motto 
this team has 
taken. ‘Can’t 
break steel.’ 

“I’m just so 

incredibly proud 
of them, just 
really staying 
together as 
a team. And 
people say this 
is an individual 
sport. It’s not. 
We succeeded 
because we 
have stayed 
together 
as a team, 
and when 
there’s one 
blip on the 
screen, 
everyone 
else steps up and has that person’s back. 
We’ve been doing that all season long, and 
last night and tonight.”

UCLA punched its ticket early, by no 

surprise. For the Wolverines, it took a 
little bit longer, a little more waiting. 

But when the moment came to punch 

that second ticket to Fort Worth, they’d 
put in the work. They earned their spot 
as one of eight teams left in the nation 
to compete next Friday, collectively, as a 
whole, together. 

“Can’t break steel.”

Sainristil impressing in spring ball

Mike Sainristil was one of those 
guys in high school. The kind that 
played seemingly every position 
and did it well, his athleticism the 
prevailing reason he stepped on 
a football field and stayed there 
nearly the whole time.
Even when he committed to 
Michigan, it was unclear whether 
Sainristil’s talents would be best 
fit at wide receiver or cornerback. 
A few weeks into spring ball, Jim 
Harbaugh said, “Defensive coaches 
would be fighting to have Mike as a 
corner.” But, for now, the defensive 
staff has lost that battle.
Sainristil is a wide receiver. And, 
by all accounts, he looks good doing 
it.
“He has a level of quickness, 
change 
of 
direction, 
speed,” 
Harbaugh said last Wednesday. 
“Been really eye-opening and 
really good for the team. He’s also 
tough. He’s blocking.”
For now, with juniors Donovan 
Peoples-Jones and Nico Collins 
out, Sainristil is taking starting 
reps as the H receiver, in the slot. 
For someone who juggled multiple 
positions in high school, his game 
already has an unusual refinement. 
Offensive coordinator Josh Gattis 

tweeted a video last week of the 
early enrollee running an out route 
and doing so with the technical 
ability required of a college wide 
receiver.
At Michigan’s open practice 
on Saturday, Sainristil stood out 
in the same way. During red zone 
drills, he effortlessly hauled in a 
touchdown off a crossing route 
from Dylan McCaffrey. Minutes 
later, he caught a bullet over the 
middle from Joe Milton.
“Wow, he is quick. He’s a really 
good football player,” said junior 
Ben Mason. “A really tough guy, 
too. He’s not afraid to stick his nose 
in there and make a block. So he’s a 
guy that I’m really confident having 
on the field with us.”
There’s enough spring hype to go 
around, but as far as early enrollees 
go, Sainristil is getting the brunt 
of the compliments. Though just a 
3-star recruit, thanks to his 5-foot-
10 stature and the lack of high-end 
recruits in Massachusetts — and 
a 3-star without a clear position 
at that — he seems to be doing 
everything right thus far.
That goes beyond the field. It 
means going into class, getting in 
the weight room and doing it all on 
time.
“He’s doing everything to a T,” 
said senior guard Mike Onwenu. 

“He’s taking a lotta reps. … He’s 
stepped up to the plate. It’s crazy to 
see that as a freshman.”
Both Harbaugh and Mason 
brought up the blocking as well, 
a characteristic that shows up on 
Sainristil’s high school tape despite 
his 179-pound frame. He seeks 
out contact and looks to lay guys 
out. That’s the type of thing that 
endears him to Harbaugh.
“There’s 
probably 
three 
examples where you can see 
his second, third, fourth effort 
down the field,” Harbaugh said. 
“Sometimes 20, 30, 40 yards down 
the field, blocking for whoever does 
have the ball. If you don’t have the 
ball, then you become a blocker. 
He’s been really good and can’t say 
enough good things about him.”
Michigan’s 
receiving 
corps 
lacked depth last season. Outside 
of Peoples-Jones, Collins and tight 
end Zach Gentry, nobody earned 
the consistent trust of quarterback 
Shea Patterson. That’s a hole 
Sainristil — along with tight end 
Nick Eubanks and a healthy Tarik 
Black — can fill.
“Mikey, just keep doing what he’s 
doing,” Harbaugh said. “... Doing 
a great job. So all compliments to 
Mike Sainristil, as long as he takes 
that flattery and, as they say, ‘Don’t 
inhale,’ should be good.”

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh has praised freshman Mike Sainristil for his play during spring practices.

‘M’ makes its mark against Illinois

There was some doubt in 
the air after the Michigan 
women’s tennis team dropped 
the doubles point.
However, 
after 
four 
consecutive wins in singles 
to follow up, all doubt was 
cleared. 
No matter the result of 
the final two matches, the 
Wolverines would win — and 
they did, 4-3. 
Against 
Illinois, 
seniors 
Brienne Minor and Kate Fahey 
set the tone, opening the meet 
with a 6-1 win. The team 
ultimately dropped the doubles 
point, but in the end, it did not 
matter.
“We are really balanced 
down the lineup and it is very 
exciting 
to 
see what this 
group can do,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 
Bernstein. 
“I 
am 
proud 
of 
our effort for 
winning 
the 
four 
singles 
points 
after 
not 
having 
that 
doubles 
point. The team works hard 

and believes in each other. 
The biggest thing is to show 
toughness and be willing to 
compete and be uncomfortable 
at times and fight for that.”
Minor won six 
of the last seven 
games, allowing 
her 
to 
leave 
the court after 
winning just two 
sets.
“My 
main 
goal 
was 
to 
be 
positive,” 
Minor said. “I 
think that really 
helped 
me. 
I 
really 
focused 
on getting a good start. I got 
on the ground and was feeling 
pretty good. My positivity and 
energy carried me through.”
As a pair, Brienne Minor 
and Kate Fahey 
are unbeatable. 
After four years 
on 
the 
team 
together, the No. 
33-nationally-
ranked duo has 
definitely found 
its footing.
“They 
know 
each other well, 
trust each other 
well,” Bernstein 
said. “They have done a great 

job and won every match. They 
give us a lot of confidence on 
the team having them together 
right now.”
After being a doubles pair 
in 
the 
fall, 
both 
Minor 
and 
Fahey 
were 
paired 
with 
other 
players to try 
out a different 
lineup. 
However, they 
were put back 
together 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
Big 
Ten 
season. 
Ever 
since then, the two have been a 
powerhouse.
“It was like nothing had 
changed,” Minor said. “We 
knew how we played together. 
We just know our games really 
well. We played together a little 
freshman 
year, 
sophomore, 
and junior year, so we just trust 
each other.”
Minor attributes the team 
mentality to her success on the 
court.
“I go out to the court and 
focus on the team and not 
myself,” Minor said. “It helps 
me get through my individual 
match because I am focused on 
getting that win for the team.”

Wolverines play sharp in Boston

On Saturday, Saint Francis 
(Pa.) was ill-prepared for the 
Michigan water polo team’s 
suffocating 
defense, 
going 
scoreless until the final minute 
of the fourth quarter. The 
final score told a story of a 
massive disparity in play, and 
the Wolverines won, 18-1. The 
Red Flash (9-20 overall, 0-2 
CWPA) took just 12 shots the 
entire game, to the Wolverines’ 
31. Later that day, Michigan 
faced Brown (15-11, 0-3) and 
brought the same high-level 
performance, winning 21-2. 
The pair of commanding 
victories came on the opening 
day of a weekend in which the 
sixth-ranked Wolverines (18-8, 
3-0) traveled to Boston to start 
conference play 
at 
Harvard’s 
Blodgett 
Pool. 
The first day was 
characterized by 
total dominance 
on both offense 
and 
defense 
for 
Michigan 
against 
its 
conference 
opponents. 
Sunday 
saw 
a 
far closer battle against No. 15 
Princeton, in which Michigan 
ultimately 
prevailed. 
9-6. 
With 
their 
strong 
showing, 
the Wolverines are now 3-0 in 
conference play. 
Senior Julia Sellers was a 
force on offense in the first 
two games, scoring three goals 
against Saint Francis and a 
career-high six against Brown, 
including four straight in the 
first quarter. 
“She was the cog that carried 
us on the offensive end,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Marcelo 
Leonardi. “Generating a lot 
of one-on-nobodies, a lot of 
exclusions, a lot of scoring 
opportunities for others as well.”
While the first two opponents 
offered little resistance, the 
team knew it would have to be 
ready for a tenacious Princeton 
team. 
“I wanted to make sure that 

our bench got a lot of minutes 
early on in the first two games,” 
Leonardi said. “And then the 
third game we were fresh 
enough to play.”
Against Princeton, it initially 
looked as if the Wolverines might 
run away with 
the win again, 
getting off to a 
5-1 lead in the 
second quarter. 
But 
unlike 
Michigan’s first 
two opponents, 
the 
Tigers 
rallied 
on 
offense, 
with 
five 
players 
each 
scoring 
goals, as they cut the deficit to 
8-6 with roughly three minutes 
remaining in the game. 
Just as it looked as though 
the Tigers might tie the game 
in regulation, Sellers managed 
to draw a penalty during a 
breakaway. 
On 
the 
subsequent 
penalty 
shot, 
Junior 
Maddy 
Steere 
secured 
a hat trick and 
put 
the 
game 
out of reach for 
Princeton with a 
goal. 
“You win by 
one, you win by 
20 it’s still a win,” 
Leonardi 
said. 
“I felt composure-wise in the 
fourth quarter we did a good job 
of just showing a bit of maturity 
and composure to finish the 
game off.” 

Much of Michigan’s success 
against Princeton was due to the 
team’s effectiveness in drawing 
penalties and converting them. 
Senior Kim Johnson stood out 
as she drew six exclusions and 
three 
penalties, 
and 
Steere 
scored on three of the four 
5-meter penalties in the game.
Leonardi attributes much of 
the team’s poise and success this 
weekend to the difficult road 
schedule the team has endured 
this season. Three weeks prior, 
the 
Wolverines 
traveled 
to 
California to face a gauntlet of 
three ranked teams in a single 
weekend. Michigan has now 
played 23 games against ranked 
teams this season and won 15 of 
them. 
After a strong conference 
debut, 
the 
Wolverines 
will 
emphasize cleaning up their 
play 
and 
improving 
game-
time decision-making as they 
approach the end of regular 
season 
conference 
play 
and 
the 
upcoming 
CWPA 
and 
NCAA 
championships.
“We 
went 
3-0, 
which 
is 
always 
important,” 
Leonardi 
said. 
“We also got a 
lot of minutes 
for our second and third teams 
and then our first unit got 
challenged against Princeton. 
So, I felt overall we had a good 
weekend.”

Jack Lint lifts himself to victory

When he was sitting on a 
hospital bed 18 months ago, Jack 
Lint would have never predicted 
that he would be the second-
highest decathlete performer in 
Michigan’s history upon return.
As the fifth-year senior nursed 
his shoulder immediately after 
surgery, 
he 
could 
not 
have 
imagined throwing a javelin 56.79 
meters, a distance over four-and-
a-half meters longer than his 
previous best. But he did — putting 
himself into prime contention 
for a spot in the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships.
“I really didn’t expect it to 
happen this soon or that well or 
that I would get a huge (personal 
record) like that,” Lint said.
It seems unlikely on the surface, 
but Lint delivered with a come-
from-behind win at the Jim Click 
Shootout, winning the event with 
an overall personal score of 7,596 
points. 690 of those points came 
from the javelin throw, which was 
essential for him to win the overall 
event.
The throw prevented Lint 
from falling 125 points behind, 
as his original throw would have 

had him do. The latter throw 
allowed him to surmount Texas 
Tech freshman Axel Hubert, the 
eventual runner-up, with a 116-
point comparative victory in the 
1,500 meters.
Thanks in no small part to an 
extreme level of dedication and an 
admirably positive mentality, Lint 
completed the race of his life.
“I was rehabbing, you know, 
two or three or four hours a day, 
every day,” Lint said, “pretty 
much all the way through at least 
February or March and then 
after that, you know, continuing 
another hour or so every day. … 
My goal was always to come back 
and compete, you know, throw. So 
I kind of kept that in the front of 
my mind the whole time.
“My 
rehab 
process 
was 
definitely 
a 
lot 
longer 
than 
anticipated or expected, so just to 
keep that in mind, even though 
things weren’t happening fast. 
‘Eventually I’ll get back’ was what 
I was telling myself.”
Lint worked incredibly hard in 
pursuit of his goal, fighting to get 
back to full strength even in the 
face of setbacks and complications.
“I couldn’t even really run until 
November or December (2017),” 
Lint said. “So three or four months 

without running, and no running 
fast until January, so this past 
year has just been building back to 
where I was.”
Despite that being what Lint 
has had to do over the last year, 
his actual performance does not 
reflect as such, a result he chalks 
up to confidence. Lint told his 
coach that he was going to throw a 
personal best in the javelin during 
warmups for the event, a remark 
met with a laugh that looks foolish 
in hindsight.
“I just had confidence that it 
was gonna work out well,” Lint 
said. “And then in warmups, 
everything was going well. It just 
came together.”
Whether it was confidence, 
ambivalence or just good juju, the 
result was everything Lint could 
have hoped for. His journey back 
to the level he wants to compete 
at is far from over, but he certainly 
laid an auspicious groundwork 
and has plenty to be excited about 
moving forward.
“It was just really awesome to 
get a personal best in the whole 
decathlon, and then also to know 
that my shoulder is back to being 
better than it ever was,” Lint said. 
“I think that was definitely the 
highlight of the entire trip.”

My positivity 
and energy 
carried me 
through.

And then the 
third game 
we were fresh 
enough to play.

Watching their team down 
6-5 with two outs in the bottom 
of the seventh, the crowd started 
to clear, anticipating Michigan’s 
first loss in the Big Ten. But the 
Wolverines didn’t back down.
Facing a 3-2 count with two 
runners on base, senior MacKenzie 
Nemitz swung hard, finding a gap 
between center and right field that 
propelled the Wolverines to a 7-6 
walk-off victory over Indiana.
“It’s a great win,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “Hopefully 
we take confidence from it, we 
should take a lot of good things. 
But they should take our energy 
in the seventh inning that we had. 
We were all one heartbeat. Every 
kid in that dugout was on point. 
And that’s how you win big.” 
But this win was by no means 
pretty. 
On a gameday dedicated to her, 
senior first baseman Alex Sobczak 
made sure that her impact was 
felt right in the first inning. After 
an infield single by fellow senior 
Natalie Peters, Sobczak hit a high 
fly ball to center field. However, 
instead of making the catch to end 
the inning, the Hoosiers’ Taylor 
Lambert dropped the ball, giving 
an RBI double to Sobczak for the 
first run of the game. 
On the very next at-bat, Sobczak 
got help from another senior, this 
time Nemitz, who sent Sobczak 
home on a triple, giving Michigan 
an early 2-0 lead at the end of the 
first.
But after a silent second inning 
by both squads, Indiana came to 
life. After getting a runner on base 
on a perfectly executed bunt, the 
Hoosiers tied the game at two off 
a two-run homer to left field by 
Grayson Radcliffe.
Michigan, however, recovered 
with a home run of its own on the 
flip side of the third inning. And it 
was none other than the red-hot 
Sobczak who went yard. With 

freshman Lexie Blair sitting on 
second base off a two-out double, 
Sobczak drove a high-flying ball 
over the center field wall and was 
bombarded by her teammates at 
home plate as she rounded the 
bases for a second time today, 
putting the Wolverines back in the 
lead, 4-2.
In the top of the fourth, 
Hutchins, hoping to get four 
innings out of today’s starter, 
freshman 
right-hander 
Alex 
Storako, was forced to substitute 
her out for Beaubien in an attempt 
to limit Indiana’s hits. However, 
Beaubien could not find her All-
American form, giving up an RBI 
double to Katie Lacefield before 
hitting Juvia Davis and walking 
Taylor Lambert, which loaded the 
bases for Indiana with just one 
out. 
Then Radcliffe, who hit a home 
run earlier, drilled a single to 
left field. However, rather than 
scooping up the easy grounder, 
Blair took her eyes off the ball too 
early as the single rolled past her 
and turned into a bases-clearing 

triple, giving the Hoosiers a 6-4 
lead after the fourth.
And right when Beaubien, who 
threw for five strikeouts and no 
more runs the rest of the game, 
finally locked in, the Michigan 
offense could not string together 
a series of hits to spark any sort of 
comeback – until with one out in 
the seventh inning. 
Senior second baseman Faith 
Canfield took a solo shot straight 
to center field, reigniting a team 
and crowd that seemed to have 
lost all life. All of a sudden, Peters 
found herself as a tying runner 
with a shallow double down the 
left field line. 
After giving an intentional 
walk given to Sobczak, Nemitz 
made sure Michigan came out still 
standing at the top of the Big Ten.
“If 
our 
pitcher 
struggles, 
we need to come through,” 
Nemitz said. “If we struggle, our 
pitchers need to come through. 
We complement so well and the 
whole game, I had a weird inkling 
that we were going to get it done 
together. As a team.”

Like many of the No. 23 
Michigan softball team’s series, 
the Wolverines’ bats started slow 
in this weekend’s matchup against 
Indiana.
In 
Friday 
and 
Saturday’s 
contests, the Wolverines failed to 
get on the board until the third 
inning in both games, registering 
just seven runs over two days. 
But, also like many of the 
Wolverines’ games, all Michigan 
needed was a spark.
While the Wolverines came 
out on top in all three games, it 
was close each game, beating the 
Hoosiers by three runs on Friday 
and one in each of the final two. 
In each game, the offense was 
sparked by a different player: junior 
third baseman Madison Uden’s 
home run on Friday, sophomore 
shortstop Natalia Rodriguez’s bunt 
on Saturday and Natalie Peters 
single on Sunday. 
After Peters reached first in the 
first inning of the series finale, a 

fire had been lit. One batter later, 
senior first baseman Alex Sobczak 
— the third of the power trio which 
had kept Michigan afloat earlier in 
the series — kept the streak going. 
Sobczak drilled a ball deep into 
center field for a double on which 
Peters reached home from first 
base.
This section of the lineup — from 
Peters to Sobczak — accounted for 
over half of the Wolverines’ runs 
this weekend. 
Senior 
designated 
player 
Mackenzie Nemitz extended this 
hot streak with 
her first triple 
of the season, 
sending Sobczak 
home 
and 
increasing 
the 
Wolverines’ lead 
to two. 
“Early in the 
game, we’re just 
trying to be on 
base,” 
Nemitz 
said. 
“I 
see 
(Michigan coach Carol Hutchins) 
waving me around and I’m like, ‘Is 
she sure?’ I even hesitated running 
around the bag for a second. It’s 
just about going hard the whole 
game. Don’t take any play off. Don’t 
take any at-bat off. It’s a fight.”
Blair returned to the plate in 
the bottom of the third, where she 
fired off a double to center field. 
Sobczak filed a ball to the same 
spot as her earlier at-bat, the only 
difference being this one cleared 
the center field wall for a two-run 
homer. 
The Wolverines struggled to 
keep this fire lit later as the game 
progressed, going through three 
innings with only one hit — a 
problem they’d struggled with all 
weekend. 
In both Friday and Saturday’s 
games, Michigan scored all of its 
runs between the third and fourth 
innings. While they continued 
to get runners on base, the 
Wolverines failed to get another 
runner all the way around the 

diamond for the remainder of each 
game. 
When asked what accounted 
for the offensive slowdowns, some 
players cited a lack of patience at 
the plate. Hutchins thought it had 
to do with something else entirely: 
mentality. 
“I didn’t think we swung well 
all weekend until the last inning,” 
Hutchins said. “Their pitchers 
knew how to keep us off balance 
but we didn’t adjust — we never 
adjusted.”
Sobczak, known for swinging 
early, 
thought 
Michigan 
was 
more patient facing 
Indiana’s pitchers 
in Sunday’s contest, 
though 
Hutchins 
disagreed. 
“They were so 
locked-in in the 
seventh and they 
were not locked-
in in quite a few 
innings,” Hutchins 
said. “We had a lot of bad at-bats. I 
did not agree with their assessment 
of their pitch selections at all. We 
gave away a lot of at-bats. We were 
sitting on pitches — meaning we 
were hunting for a specific pitch — 
and we were still mishitting them.”
Whether it was an issue of 
patience or a mental shift, the 
Wolverines made a change in the 
final inning, regaining momentum 
in a way they hadn’t been able to 
earlier in the series.
Down by two, senior second 
baseman Faith Canfield shot a 
ball out of the park, bringing the 
Hoosiers’ lead down to one. After 
Blair popped out to center field, 
Peters hit a double. Indiana right-
hander Tara Trainer intentionally 
walked Sobczak, putting two 
runners on base with Nemitz at 
the plate. 
With a walk-off double, Nemitz 
ended the game.
“It doesn’t matter when you 
score,” Hutchins said. “As long as 
the game doesn’t run out.”

Senior designated player Mackenzie Nemitz hit a walk-off double to lift Michigan over the Hoosiers on Sunday.

Don’t take any 
play off. Don’t 
take any at-bat 
off.

Wolverines dominate Minnesota, 8-0

With the bases loaded and an 
angry home crowd, it seemed 
like 
the 
Wolverines’ 
early 
success against Minnesota was 
about to stall. 
The mood in Ray Fisher 
Stadium had grown frustrated 
as the umpire called ball after 
ball on starting sophomore right-
hander Jeff Criswell’s pitching.
That quickly fizzled away, 
however, as a double play ended 
the fourth inning as a groundout 
from Minnesota’s Cole McDevitt 
was caught by senior Blake 
Nelson, flung to second and then 
to senior Jimmy Kerr at first to 
catch Jordan Kozicky.
This sharp fielding was on 
display throughout Michigan’s 
8-0 win in the final game of 
its weekend series against the 
Golden 
Gophers 
on 
Sunday 
afternoon. The Wolverines were 
eager to round out the series on 
a high note after hard-fought 
games Friday and Saturday that 
ended 4-6 and 5-3, respectively. 
They did that and more. The 
Wolverines’ scoring started early 
as sophomore Jesse Franklin 
fired off a home run to right 
field in the bottom of the first 
— foreshadowing a home run-
heavy day. Not to be outdone, 
Kerr launched another one to 
right field for Michigan’s first 
at-bat in the second. 
“I think we really just had the 

mindset of attacking them from 
the beginning,” Franklin said. 
“They’re a good team and after 
this weekend we wanted to get a 
series win.
“We were all ready to go. I 
just got up to bat sooner than the 
other guys.”
Clutch plays from Michigan, 
as well as reliable pitching from 
Criswell, prevented Minnesota 
from ever gaining any kind of 
foothold offensively. In the top 
of the second, Blomgren and 
Kerr combined to turn a ground 
out into an inning-ending double 
play. 
Criswell, 
meanwhile, 
excelled all day in detecting the 
Golden Gophers’ attempts to 
steal bases. 
“I thought Jeff (Criswell) 
had his best day today,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“He did a really good job 
pitching us out of huge jams 
… they had plenty of scoring 
opportunities and to minimize 
those opportunities was a huge 
storyline this weekend.” 
Even 
when 
he 
didn’t, 
Michigan’s 
strong 
fielding 
stepped in. When Minnesota’s 
Drew 
Hmielewski 
slipped 
behind Criswell in the top of 
the third and sprinted toward 
second base, sophomore catcher 
Joe Donovan reacted instantly, 
firing the ball to senior Ako 
Thomas at second base to stop 
him in his tracks.
The Wolverines’ consistent 
defense was certainly integral to 

their win. 
“We played great defense,” 
Bakich said. “Those double plays 
were huge momentum plays, 
all three to end the inning in 
really high-leverage, high-traffic 
situations.”
The fifth inning showcased 
Minnesota’s 
difficulty 
in 
breaking 
through. 
Right-
hander 
Brett 
Schulze, 
who 
came from the bullpen in one of 
the team’s numerous pitching 
changes, cycled through nine of 
Michigan’s hitters and allowed a 
two-run homer from sophomore 
Jack Blomgren.
In the bottom of the seventh, 
the crowd erupted in cheers for 
Criswell as he was relieved by 
sophomore left-hander Angelo 
Smith. A close call with the 
bases loaded in the eighth was 
once again extinguished by a 
fast-paced 
Michigan 
double 
play to end the inning and keep 
Minnesota scoreless.
Two more runs from Donovan 
and Lewis brought the final 
score to 8-0 — a far cry from 
the close games on Friday and 
Saturday. 
“I didn’t really feel like 
we played too well Friday or 
yesterday,” Bakich said. “So our 
challenge going into today was 
really to have a complete game 
from a pitching, offensive, and 
defensive standpoint … to play 
championship-caliber baseball.
“Our guys responded to that 
challenge very well.”

Clutch hitting lifts ‘M’ past Gophers

Offense seemed like Michigan 
baseball’s weak spot.
Its starting pitchers were 
dominant, its relievers capable 
and its defense talented. Going 
into the season, the biggest 
question about Team 153 on 
paper was how much its lineup 
could produce when it mattered.
Against 
Minnesota 
this 
weekend, those questions were 
finally answered: This team can 
hit.
Clutch 
performances 
up 
and down the lineup made the 
difference in the Wolverines’ 
victories Saturday and Sunday 
over one of their toughest Big 
Ten competitors. In Saturday’s 
5-3 win over the Golden Gophers, 
senior second baseman Ako 
Thomas made the difference, 
launching a two-out double to 
score the winning two runs in 
the bottom of the seventh inning. 
On Sunday, it was sophomore 
center fielder Jesse Franklin. 
He homered off the first pitch 
he saw in the opening inning to 
put the first run on the board 
for Michigan. He later plated 
sophomore catcher Joe Donovan 
on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of 
the seventh inning to help the 
Wolverines to a comfortable 8-0 
victory.
“We had the mindset of 
attacking them right from the 
beginning,” Franklin said. “We 
were all ready to go as soon as 
we got up to bat. Everyone was 
just really focused. We’re good 
enough that when we’re focused, 
we can beat good teams like that 
8-0, so it was great to do that.”
Going 
into 
the 
weekend, 
Minnesota’s 
presented 
a 
formidable 
challenge. 
No. 
1 
starter Max Meyer came into his 
start Friday with an earned run 
average of 1.72. Their offense 
was hot off a 14-4 midweek 
win. Of the Big Ten competition 
Michigan has faced or will face 
this season, the Gophers might 
be the toughest.
In 
Friday’s 
game, 
that 
challenge appeared to be too 
much for the Wolverines. Though 
they got on the board first on a 

two-run homer from Franklin 
in the bottom of the first, they 
could not find a consistent spark, 
stranding nine runners on base 
and falling 6-4 as their ninth-
inning rally came up short.
Saturday’s game was a battle, 
but Michigan was eventually 
able to wear down the Gopher 
pitchers. After taking a 2-1 
lead off a two-run single from 
Franklin, the Wolverines tied 
the game at three on an opposite-
field home run 
from junior right 
fielder 
Jordan 
Brewer 
before 
taking the lead 
on 
Thomas’ 
double.
Sunday was a 
different 
story. 
Franklin’s home 
run sparked the 
offense, 
and 
it 
didn’t 
slow 
down for the rest of game. In 
the second inning, senior third 
baseman Jimmy Kerr hit his 
sixth home run of the year. Kerr 
also scored in the bottom of the 
fifth as sophomore shortstop 
Jack Blomgren knocked a blast of 
his own.
“Having our offense score in 
all but two innings, being able to 
keep a lot of pressure on them, 
we really just had a lot of quality 
at-bats,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “When we get a ball 
to smash – something we can do 
damage with – it’s about taking 
advantage of the ball and getting 
a few home runs.”
But 
Michigan’s 
offensive 

success on this weekend wasn’t 
just limited to the long ball. In 
Saturday’s game, Michigan tied 
the contest in the bottom of the 
second inning off a two-run 
single from Franklin. On Sunday, 
Kerr, Franklin, and sophomore 
designated hitter Jordan Nwogu 
all notched RBI on smaller hits: 
a single for Kerr, a sacrifice fly 
for Franklin, and a double for 
Nwogu. 
Over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
weekend, 
the 
Wolverines 
came up with 
hits when they 
needed 
them 
most. A seventh-
inning go-ahead 
double 
to 
tie 
the 
series. 
A 
go-ahead 
home 
run to win a 
weekend 
series 
against a major 
conference competitor. Team 
153 is starting to look more and 
more like the serious competitor 
that Bakich described at the 
beginning of the season.
“You just want to try to 
put those competitive at-bats 
together, 
and 
string 
those 
quality at-bats together,” Bakich 
said. “When we’ve had our best 
scoring days, it’s when we’ve 
had quality at-bat after quality 
at-bat together, and getting a 
big hit that clears the bases. The 
mindset is always just continuing 
to improve and continuing to get 
better. That’s just where we are. 
We’ve just got to keep getting 
better.”

After the first rotation of 
the NCAA Regionals, the No. 7 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team was in first place and had 
just notched its highest score 
of the season on vault. 
But its next event, bars, 
proved to be a bigger challenge 
than anticipated. 
Many 
of 
the 
gymnasts 
seemed to struggle with their 
handstands, nearly falling out 
of the handstand the wrong 
way. Neither freshmen Abby 
Heiskell nor Maddie Mariani 
could break past a 9.800, and 
the team already looked shaky. 
So when freshman Abby 
Brenner bent on her handstand 
and swung the wrong way, she 
was forced to let go of the bar, 
collect herself and resume. 
While the fall didn’t end up 
counting towards Michigan’s 
score — the lowest score is 
dropped — it put more pressure 
on the gymnasts to follow 
knowing every mistake counts. 
Brenner ended up scoring 
a 9.250, a score that would 
have been detrimental to the 
Wolverines had it counted. 
The Wolverines needed a 
clean routine to shake off the 
nerves, and that’s what senior 
Olivia Karas provided. While 
she didn’t hit all her lines, she 
landed with a clean stick — 
good for a 9.900. 
Rounding out the event was 
freshman Natalie Wojcik and 
sophomore Lauren Farley, and 
while both routines were clean, 
there seemed to be some nerves 

coming from the Wolverines, 
and their scores reflected that. 
The gymnasts scored a 9.825 
and 9.800, respectively, both 
scores relatively low for them. 
Michigan 
finished 
the 
rotation with a 49.050, its 
lowest score of the weekend. 
While 
the 
score 
wasn’t 
disastrous for the Wolverines, 
they ended the day in second 
place. They advanced to the 
regional finals, which meant 
they would start Saturday’s 
competition on bars. 
“There are so many things 
that factor into higher or 
lowing scoring,” said Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki. “Different 
judging panels can be tighter 
or looser, and sometimes it’s 
not even about what your 
performance 
is. 
We 
didn’t 
get hung up on (Friday) at all. 
We were excited about this 
rotation. 
“… I’m certainly not going 
to say that we deliberately 
finished second, but I knew 
that it was a possibility to 
finish second and we still made 
that decision because it was all 
about (Saturday).”
In practice leading up to 
the event, Plocki and the 
team made a point to practice 
sticking landings — specifically 
on vault. But that’s not to 
say it can’t transfer to other 
rotations. They proved the 
practice had paid off during 
Friday’s vault rotation where 
nearly every gymnast stuck her 
landing. Then it was time to 
transfer that to bars. 
“It’s 
definitely 
nerve-
wracking when you’ve had 

some mistakes and you have 
to start there,” Karas said on 
Saturday. “I think we handled 
it really well. I think we left 
yesterday in yesterday, and 
we looked at today with a new 
mindset. I couldn’t be more 
excited. I think this team did 
great.”
It 
was 
clear 
from 
the 
beginning that the Wolverines 
were off to a better start than 
the day before. Each routine 
looked 
cleaner 
and 
more 
confident, and it reflected in 
the scores. All gymnasts either 
matched or improved their 
score from the day before, 
including Brenner, whose score 
jumped by 0.575. 
Not all the routines were 
perfect, and the dismounts will 
need to be perfected to assure 
those stuck landings if the team 
wants a chance at the national 
title, but just making those 
small corrections can make 
a big difference. Michigan 
finished with 49.200, just 0.150 
better than the day before. 
In a competition where only 
the top two teams advance, 
Michigan just barely edged out 
Alabama for second place. The 
Wolverines managed a 197.275, 
while the Crimson Tide missed 
out with a 197.225. 
Had the Wolverines’ bars 
performance been similar to 
Friday’s, they may not have 
punched their ticket to Fort 
Worth, Texas. So the focus for 
Michigan will be making the 
small changes and practicing 
as usual, because the final 
result can come down to mere 
tenths of a point.

Lauren Farley jumped up and 
down, threw her hands in the 
air and cheered: “We’re going 
to Texas. We’re going to Texas!” 
Mere 
moments 
earlier 
the No. 7 Michigan women’s 
gymnastics team had punched 
its 
ticket 
to 
the 
NCAA 
Championships.
“It’s honestly the best thing 
I could have asked for,” said 
senior Olivia Karas. “There’s no 
better feeling.”
The competition to advance 
to the final round kicked off 
Friday 
afternoon, 
and 
the 
Wolverines faced No. 22 Ohio 
State, No. 24 Penn State and 
No. 10 Alabama. Walking into 
Crisler Center, they had one 
goal — advance to Saturday.
Opening the meet on vault, 
Michigan did what it’s been 
aiming to do all 
season — stick 
landings. 
Big 
Ten Freshman of 
the Year Natalie 
Wojcik led the 
charge 
earning 
a 9.925 for her 
nearly 
perfect 
Yurchenko 
one-
and-a-half. 
The 
scores added up 
to a season high 
of 49.425.
“We’ve been working so 
hard on improving our lands on 
vault,” said Michigan coach Bev 
Plocki on Friday. “We saw it pay 
off today and I hope that will 
give us more confidence going 
into tomorrow.”
Despite 
a 
strong 
first 
rotation, the team looked stiff 
on the bars. Its handstands 
weren’t 90 degrees, and the 
landings weren’t stuck. 
On 
floor, 
traditionally 
a 
high-scoring 
event 
for 
the 
Wolverines, they only received 
one score above a 9.900. Karas 
— ranked twenty third on floor 
nationally — did not compete. 
Wojcik won the event for the 
day with a 9.925. Plocki made 
the decision to scratch the sixth 

gymnast because Michigan had 
clinched the second qualifying 
spot already.
Overall, the Wolverines had 
a solid performance, but Plocki 
saw room for improvement.
“We 
made, 
not 
major 
mistakes, 
but 
we made some, 
some things that 
we’re going to 
have to clean up 
for 
tomorrow,” 
Plocki said.
Saturday 
night 
featured 
No. 10 Alabama, 
No. 2 UCLA, No. 
14 Nebraska and 
the Wolverines. 
With such fierce competition, 
Michigan couldn’t afford to 
make the same mistakes on 
bars where it opened the meet.
Routine after routine, the 
Wolverines stepped up and got 
the job done. 
Their 
score 
had improved 
by 
.150 
from 
Friday 
afternoon, but 
they sat in third 
place 
after 
the 
opening 
rotation.
With ground 
to 
make 
up 
heading 
to 
the balance beam, Michigan 
needed to hit its routines. 
Freshman Maddie Mariani tied 
her season-high score of 9.850. 
Wojcik anchored the rotation 
and tied her season-high score 
of 9.950. These 
scores carried 
the Wolverines 
to 
score 
of 
49.425 for the 
rotation, good 
for 
second 
place 
and 
a 
.075 lead over 
Alabama.
“I got them 
together after 
beam,” Plocki 
said. 
“And 
I 
told them, ‘This is what great 
teams love. You thrive on the 

competition when it is like a 
half a tenth and you’re dueling 
it out routine for routine. We 
have to be that team that is 
hungry and is going to thrive on 
that adrenaline and not choke 
under the pressure.’ ”
Michigan 
spent the third 
rotation 
on 
floor. 
Karas 
was 
back 
in 
the 
lineup 
in 
her usual spot 
as anchor and 
hit 
a 
routine 
filled 
with 
personality and 
sass. She earned 
one 
of 
three 
9.000s helping the Wolverines 
to 
a 
49.450 
and 
further 
extending their lead over the 
Crimson Tide. 
Closing the meet on vault 
meant the Wolverines would 
finish earlier than the other 
three teams. Their rotation 
wasn’t as strong as it was on 
Friday — stuck landings were 
nowhere to be found. Still, they 
earned a 49.200 and a final 
score of 197.275.
Alabama sat in third place 
and finished the meet on beam. 
By the time Michigan finished 
vault, the Crimson Tide were 
only halfway through their 
lineup. So they did the only 
thing they could do — wait.
“When we finished vault 
before and they were still 
doing beam routines I told 
every single one of them I was 
proud of them,” Plocki said. “It 
wouldn’t 
have 
mattered 
the 
outcome.”
Needing 
a 
perfect 
10 
to 
tie, 
the 
Crimson 
Tide’s 
last 
gymnast 
mounted 
the 
beam 
and 
performed 
a 
nearly 
flawless 
routine. 
Her 
score flashed — 
a 9.950. The Wolverines went 
wild.

Lauren Farley threw her hands up in celebration after Michigan clinched a spot in the NCAA Championships.

We’ve been 
working 
so hard on 
improving ...

I didn’t watch 
any of the 
routines. I was 
too nervous.

You have to be 
that team that 
is hungry and is 
going to thrive.
