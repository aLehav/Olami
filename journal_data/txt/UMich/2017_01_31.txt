President 
Donald 
Trump 

signed an executive order last 
Monday that placed a hiring 
freeze on the federal government, 
with the exception of military, 
national security and public safety 
personnel.

The two-page order, which was 

promised during his campaign as 
a part of his “Day One” agenda, is 
meant to cut government payrolls 
and ensure a more efficient 
government. 

According to Trump’s contract 

with the American voter, the 
freeze is among six measures 
meant to prevent corruption 
and 
special 
interest 
group 

manipulation, a goal with which 
LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 
president 
of 
University 
of 

Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans, agrees.

“I support the federal hiring 

freeze, as I believe it’s a necessary 
step towards ‘draining the swamp’ 
of bureaucracy, special interest 
group collusion and corruption,” 
Zalamea said.

At a news conference last 

Monday, Sean Spicer, White 
House 
press 
secretary, 
said 

the freeze is meant to counter 
the expansion of the federal 
workforce. However, in 2016, 
the increase in federal workers 
was about one percent, and the 
number of executive branch 
employees hasn’t been this low 

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
approved to write a statement on 
Monday to support University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel’s 
remarks 
defending 

international 
students 
in 

response to President Donald 
Trump’s executive orderpassed 
last weekend. The order banned 
immigration and travel from 
several 
Muslim-majority 

countries such as Syria and 
Somalia, resulting in multiple 
protests 
in 
Michigan 
and 

nationwide. 

The resolution was drafted 

by SACUA member Silke-Maria 
Weineck, professor of comparative 
literature and German studies. 

SACUA member Robert Ortega, 

associate professor of social work, 
explored the possibility of adding 
statistics about the number of 
foreign faculty and students to the 
statement in order to emphasize 
the prevalence of the international 
community, but later decided 
it was unnecessary, given the 
evidence of the community’s 
importance 
to 
the 
academic 

environment.

“It’s incontrovertible that it’s a 

problem, not just with students, 
but we have faculty, we have 
families that are also experiencing 
some extreme angst,” he said.

The resolution was passed 

unanimously. 

There was discussion regarding 

whether or not SACUA should 

bring attention to the existence of 
a petition that calls for Trump to 
reconsider his immigration order, 
but there was no motion to extend 
that debate.

Aside from the petition, Ann 

Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor 
has 
also 
spoken 
outagainst 

Trump’s ban on his Facebook 
page.

“Trump and his supporters 

have polluted something beautiful 
— the honor of the United States 

and its people,” Taylor wrote. 
“The world looking in, ourselves 
looking about us, we must now 
reasonably question the continued 
truth of that reputation. Are we in 
fact a decent and just people? Is the 
United States of America a force for 
good? Do we as a people have the 
courage to try to make the world a 
better place, or are we debilitated 
by weakness and fear?”

In 
addition 
to 
endorsing 

the statement, SACUA heard 

from Kelli Trosvig, University 
vice president for information 
technology, 
about 
her 
plans 

for her new position. Trosvig 
received a five-year appointment 
to the position of vice president for 
information technology on Nov. 14 
of last year.

Trosvig said moving forward 

at the University she has her 
concerns about the availability of 
anonymous patient data to health 

The 
Central 
Student 

Government’s 
Mental 
Health 

Climate and Resources Task Force 
hosted its second town hall Monday 
night as a continuation of the first 
meeting held last Wednesday, this 
time discussing with students 
residing on North Campus.

The goal of the meeting was to 

address the results of three surveys 
regarding mental health sent to 
the entire University of Michigan 
community last semester including 
students, faculty and staff. The 
surveys 
focused 
on 
resource 

innovation and classroom climate 
and found that 91.3 percent of the 
1,000 students who responded to 
the survey have dealt with mental 
illness at some point while on 
campus. 

The town hall focused on the 

difficulties students face in finding 
mental health resources on North 
Campus. 
There 
are 
currently 

no branches of Counseling and 
Psychological Services available 
on North Campus, though CAPS 
does have counselors in the 
College of Engineering. Multiple 
organizations 
have

Students, faculty fill Hill Auditorium for first of three bicenntennial colloquium

At a bicentennial colloquium 

kicking off a yearlong celebration 
of the University of Michigan’s 
history Monday morning, U.S. 
Supreme Court Justice Sonia 
Sotomayor 
called 
out 
the 

University’s 
historically 
low 

enrollment of African-American 
and minority students.

“We 
are 
making 
large 

improvements towards a kind 
of equality but we are still far 
from it,” she said. “When you 
look at the number of African 
Americans at the University of 
Michigan, there’s a real problem 

there.”

As of October 2016, just under 

5 percent of students are African 
American, 
according 
to 
the 

University Registrar.

A

Sotomayor and German Justice 
Susanne Baer, moderated by

Despite the January cold, 

about 20 Ann Arbor residents 
marched to Nichols Arboretum 
on 
Monday 
to 
protest 
the 

University of Michigan’s decision 
to allow a deer cull on campus. 
The culling officially started on 
Monday in various parks around 
Ann Arbor, including Nichols 
Arboretum.

The march was organized by 

the Friends of Ann Arbor Wildlife 
in Nature, an animal rights group 
formed in opposition to the lethal 
deer 
management 
program 

the city of Ann Arbor has been 
pursuing since last year. 

LSA junior Aaron Brodkey, 

president of the Michigan Animal 
Respect Society, said he joined 
the march to oppose what he saw 
as wrongful human intervention 
in nature, and suggested the city 
explore non-lethal options. 

“Personally, I just think it’s 

maybe wrong or rash to make 
this decision,” Brodkey said. “I 
feel like we’re taking it into our 
own hands and playing God in 
this position and saying, ‘Hey, 
we need to massacre 100 deer for

The University of Michigan 

Museum of Art is making 

memberships free, according to 

an announcement made early 

Monday.

The museum previously 

required a minimum $50 

donation — $15 for UM 

students — for memberships, 

but continued to have free 

admission.

Members receive a 20 

percent discount at the UMMA 

store, invitations to upcoming 

events and exhibitions, a 

subscription to the UMMA 

magazine, a calendar and 

reciprocal admission to over 

50 participating museums. 

Now, UMMA members who 

contribute $100 or more will 

receive reciprocal admissions to 

853 North American museums 

and 12 Michigan museums.

Instead of the $50 fee, 

UMMA encourages annual gifts 

to the museum to help it extend 

its philosophy of inclusion and 

accessibility. A new grant from 

the Community Foundation 

for Southeast Michigan — a 

philanthropic organization 

aimed at making positive 

change — has made the free 

membership possible. 

“UMMA hopes to upend the 

notion that to be a stakeholder 

in the Museum’s future, you 

have to be a major donor,” said 

Carrie Throm, UMMA deputy 

director of Development and 

External Relations in a release. 

“UMMA belongs to the citizens 

of Michigan, the University, and 

— now, truly — everyone.”

UMMA’s educational 

programs serve approximately 

35,000 people annually, and 

the museum broke a record for 

hosting almost 250,000 visitors 

last year. Those who want to 

sign up for the free membership 

program can do so online or at 

UMMA’s store on site. The free 

memberships do not expire.

“UMMA is excited to offer 

free membership to everyone,” 

said UMMA Interim Director 

Kathryn Huss in the release. 

“Our goal is to promote the 

discovery, contemplation and 

enjoyment of art, and to be 

accessible to everyone. We 

welcome more people to join us 

in that mission.”

Civil 
rights 
activist 
Fred 

Korematsu was honored at a 
panelist 
dinner 
on 
Monday 

evening in South Hall. Since 
Korematsu’s death in 2005, 
several states have declared 
his birthday, Jan. 30, Fred 
Korematsu Day.

About 30 people attended 

the event, which was hosted 
by the Asian Pacific American 
Law 
Student 
Association 

and the Muslim Law Student 
Association.

Korematsu brought a case 

to the Supreme Court in 1944, 
stating the Japanese internment 
camps put in place during World 
War II were unconstitutional. 
Korematsu v. United States 

ruled in favor of the government 
and Korematsu was convicted 
of resisting the executive order. 
Korematsu’s 
conviction 
was 

eventually overturned in 1983, 
though the court ruling stands.

Panelists 
discussed 

Korematsu’s actions in light 
of President Donald Trump’s 
recent executive order. First-
year 
Law 
student 
Layan 

Charara, the political action 

chair of Muslim Law Student 
Association, told the Daily 
Korematsu’s work can serve 
as a model in today’s political 
climate

“Korematsu 
is 
a 
very 

important civil rights activist 
for many reasons, not just for 
Asian Americans, but also 
lately for Muslim Americans 
and all people of color,” 
Charara said.

In 
light 
of 
Trump’s 

executive 
order, 
which 

banned 
the 
travel 
and 

resettlement 
of 
citizens 

from seven Muslim-majority 
countries to the United States, 
the panelists drew similarities 
between 
Korematsu’s 
case 

and 
Japanese-American 

internment to the current 
discrimination 
and 
hate 

crimes occurring across the 
nation.

When asked about the 

repercussions of Trump’s 
recent actions, panelist and 
activist Asha Noor stated 
the country is in a state of 
crisis.

“The last time there was so 

much outrage was after 9/11,” 
Noor said. “For the next four 
years, it’s not going to be just 
marches and protests; it’s 
going to be legal battles.”

Panelists urged audience 

members 
to 
ally 
with 

organizations 
and 
come 

together to stand against the 
hate crimes occurring around 
the nation.

since 1965.

Despite 
worry 
from 
union 

members and veterans, Spicer said 
the freeze is ultimately to protect 
the working class.

“Some people are working two, 

three jobs just to get by,” Spicer 
said. “And to see money get wasted 
in Washington on a job that is 
duplicative is insulting to the hard 
work that they do to pay their 
taxes.”

LSA junior Taiwo Dosunmu, 

communications director of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said in an email 
interview he agrees with the 
sentiment that Americans are 
hardworking, but he questioned 
whether or not Trump’s motives 
were really to protect them.

“The 
vast 
majority 
of 

government 
employees 
and 

civil servants are talented and 
hardworking people who help 
government agencies run smoothly 
and effectively,” Dosunmu wrote. 
“President Trump, in contrast, 
has clear conflicts of interest 
and has nominated people to 
high 
government 
office 
that 

are beholden to Wall Street, oil 
companies, and other special 
interests. Even a week in, his 
administration is the embodiment 
of everything he falsely claims this 
executive order will help correct.”

Individuals who have been 

hired but who have not yet started 
working could still be affected by 
the freeze. Although the freeze 
is scheduled to last 90 days, 
until Trump’s budget director 
recommends a long-term plan, 
LSA senior Dominic Russel now 
worries for his job at the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau.

Russel expected to start his job 

in July, well after the scheduled 
90-day limit, but his employers are 
still unable guarantee the security 
of his job.

“They sent out an email a day or 

so after the freeze saying that the 
legal team is going to look more 
into it,” Russel said. “I’m definitely 
hoping for the best, but I would like 
a more definitive response.”

At risk of putting his position 

further 
in 
jeopardy, 
Russel 

declined to comment further on 
the broad effects of the freeze.

LSA freshman Helena Harmon 

has also been feeling the effects 
of the constraints. Harmon has 
a family member who works for 
the federal government, and the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
media blackout has forced her 
family to operate with discretion, 
especially considering the agency’s 
attrition program.

In addition to the stress felt by 

Harmon’s family caused by the 
hiring freeze, Harmon herself has 
goals that could be hindered by the 
precedence this legislation sets.

“I want to work for nonprofits, 

so I want to work for an (non-
governmental 
organization),” 

Harmon said. “When I graduate 
in four years, if the administration 
doesn’t change its tone, I would 
have to look at the private sector.”

Dosunmu 
also 
mentioned 

the private sector is a large part 
of freezes implemented by past 
administrations.

“First of all, the history of past 

federal hiring freezes, like the one 
under President Reagan, shows 
they don’t actually help to manage 
the size of the federal workforce,” 
he wrote. “Additionally, it ends 
up making the government spend 
more — not less — money as they 
hire expensive contractors.”

However, the private sector is 

affected by the hiring freeze as well. 
Trump wrote in his memorandum 
that contracting private sources to 
avoid the intent of the freeze is not 
permitted, a move Harmon found 
concerning.

“This is just a step further to 

prevent any work, no matter how 
important it is, from happening,” 
she said. 

Additionally, Dosunmu wrote 

he believes the freeze will not be 
effective in shrinking the federal 
workforce and is hypocritical in 
light of the large federal projects 
Trump plans to undertake.

“Trump’s hiring freeze is a 

tired old tactic of anti-government 
conservatives,” Dosunmu wrote. 
“Trump has returned to this tactic 
in an attempt to pander to Tea 
Party conservatives, while at the 
same time proposing policies like 
a wall with Mexico that would 
represent a massive increase in 
government spending and a clear 
waste of taxpayer money.”

RESPONSE
From Page 1

should respond to contrasting 
viewpoints.

Looking 
to 
the 
future, 

Sotomayor 
and 
Baer 

hypothesized 
about 
what 

universities will look like in 
the years to come. Sotomayor 
cited the low number of African 
American 
students 
at 
the 

University 
when 
discussing 

the 
future 
of 
university 

communities. This, Sotomayor 
said, is indicative of a lack of 
 

diversity on campus.

“I am going to be politically 

correct,” Sotomayor said. “It’s 
going to look a lot like Michigan 
but with even greater diversity. 
I don’t think we can get there 
without addressing it because 
it is an ideal to be a color-blind 
society.”

Baer stressed classism as the 

largest issue affecting the future 
of universities, encompassing 
other factors such as ethnicity 
or 
gender. 
The 
University 

released a 49-part Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan last 
October aiming to diversify 
students’ race, ethnicity and 
socioeconomic status, but low-
income students are still widely 
underrepresented, according to 
a report released last month. 

“The moral of class manifests 

itself differently and is located 
within different segments of 
the population,” Baer said. 
“Money matters but shouldn’t 
matter as much when it comes 
to education.”

The 
panelists 
shared 

their experiences of “firsts”: 
Sotomayor received her law 
degree from Yale University 
1979 and was nominated to the 
U.S. Supreme Court by former 
President Barack Obama in 
2009 as the first Latina to 
serve on the Supreme Court. 
Baer, a University law alum, 
is currently serving a 12-year 
term as a justice of Germany’s 
Federal Constitutional Court. 
She is the first lesbian woman 
to serve on Germany’s high 
court.

Moderator Michele Norris 

has written for ABC News, The 

Washington Post and NPR and 
currently serves on the board 
of the University’s Knight-
Wallace Fellowships program.

Before 
the 
conversation 

began, Regent Mark Bernstein 
(D) 
presented 
Sotomayor 

with an honorary Doctor of 
Laws degree — Norris and 
Baer received their honorary 
doctorates from the University 
in 2013 and 2014 respectively. 
Bernstein 
said 
Sotomayor’s 

dedication to her work and 
her promotion of equal rights 
makes her a true Wolverine.

“Sonia 
Sotomayor’s 
keen 

legal mind and a commitment 
to fairness and social justice 
and public service inspires 
students, Hispanics, women, 
all those to work to create a 
better, more equitable world,” 
Bernstein said.

In response to her new 

degree, Sotomayor gave the 
crowd a short and powerful, 
“Go Blue.”

Sotomayor, Baer and Norris 

each also spoke about the 
importance 
of 
compromise 

in communities today. With 
Norris guiding the discussion, 
Sotomayor said she must rely on 
dialogue to execute her duties.

“As judges, I think we are 

often put in a situation where 
we’re forced into community,” 
Sotomayor said. “We … have 
to decide some of the most 
complex 
questions 
that 

this society is facing and in 
America, we can dissent and 
we can disagree, but we have to 
reach a decision.”

The University community 

has 
experienced 
many 

instances 
of 
conflict 
and 

charges of lack of dialogue 
between students of opposing 
viewpoints this school year, 
including the posting of racially 
charged fliers in September 
and ongoing protests of the 
Trump administration. With 
President 
Trump’s 
Supreme 

Court 
nomination 
being 

announced Tuesday, Baer said 
effective community members 
recognize, and prioritize, their 
opposition.

“This 
community 
is 

built on the willingness to 
compromise,” 
Baer 
said. 

“It’s about being fair … being 

forceful with your arguments, 
but yet being willing to respect 
the other as a legitimate voice, 
from another world maybe but 
still legitimate.”

Sotomayor 
and 
Baer 

reflected on their experiences 
at universities and how they 
have adjusted to their current 
judicial 
positions. 
Norris 

noted 
Sotomayor 
was 
very 

shy when she first entered the 
collegiate sphere. Sotomayor 
said throwing oneself into the 
unfamiliar is the best way to 
thrive in university and beyond.

“I live a life now where I do a 

lot of talking — hence why I’m 
here — but for a good part of my 
life, I did a lot of listening and 
a lot of observing,” Sotomayor 
said. 
“I 
think 
everyone 

needs to grow and needs the 
trauma 
of 
putting 
yourself 

in situations that make you 
uncomfortable because when 
you’re comfortable, you just 
don’t change.”

Baer said, at the University, 

she was afraid of being called 
on. Speaking from her own 
experience as coming from 
another country and not being 
out as a homosexual woman, 
she said if an individual has 
to run away from issues, they 
should 
always 
chase 
new 

opportunities instead of hiding.

“For me to have those two 

challenges in my life, one 
super private that no one 
talked about and the other, 
being an international student 
and everyone knows it, what’s 
difficult to hear yet again is, 
if I have the tendency to run 
away, it’s running to a more 
comfortable place where maybe 
you can start again,” Baer said. 
“Never leave the situation. 
Never leave the opportunity but 
create your next opportunity 
and start again.”

As Norris began reading 

questions 
from 
University 

students, Sotomayor and Baer 
got out of their seats, answered 
them among the students on 
stage and in the crowd, and 
greeted students and faculty. 
In response to a question 
about how her social identity is 
reflected in her work and how 
she works with her coworkers 
with her identity in mind, 

Sotomayor said she continues 
to be vocal and refuses to allow 
people’s view of her to get in the 
way.

“For most things I think are 

important, I say them and I say 
them because even if they don’t 
win in a particular case, I said 
them with a thought process 
of solution,” Sotomayor said. 
“I may not win tomorrow but 
down the line … the voices have 
been heard.

A student in the audience 

asked Baer how public opinion 
intersects with her job as a 
justice. Baer responded with 
how justices should embrace 
public opinion in order to have 
a deeper understanding of the 
people they are representing.

“If you’re acting with these 

people and start a discussion 
with what they expect from 
you, you come into much richer 
waters,” she said. “You can 
start a conversation.”

LSA junior Stephen Mitchell 

said in contrast to what the 
public has been seeing from the 
Trump administration in terms 
of dialogue, Sotomayor and 
Baer showed the crowd how 
compromise will work in the 
years to come.

“Hearing a different story 

of what’s going on in the world 
and the direction we’re headed 
as 
a 
university 
community 

too, I think that it’s a really 
empowering feeling,” Mitchell 
said.

freshman 

Gabriella 
Pascual 
said 
the 

justices’ ideals aligned with 
those of the students attending 
today.

“Given that these people were 

agreeable toward the general 
outlook of the University, I 
think it helped incite a lot of 
inspiration and encouragement 
to go into this future with an 
optimistic outlook,” Pascual 
said. “It reminded me of why 
I’m here and what I’m looking 
to pursue in the legal force.”

Both 
guests

forward to implement a greater 
breadth of services in the area.

LSA junior Max Rothman, 

a member of the mental health 
task force, explained some of the 
difficulties students living on 
North Campus face.

“Students on North Campus 

feel that they don’t have equal 
access to utilizing mental health 
resources on campus,” Rothman 
said. “Of the students who 
currently live here on North 
Campus and who have utilized 
some sort of resource here on 
campus, 50 percent answered 
yes about whether the physical 
distance here on campus has 
deterred them from utilizing 
CAPS.”

The bus route itself can often 

create an issue for students 
who find themselves struggling 
with a sudden illness such as 
an anxiety attack. Engineering 
sophomore Natalie Baughan, 
another member of the task force, 
recalled an instance in which she 
developed the stomach flu while 
in class on North Campus and 

had to find a way to quickly get 
home.

“I had to try to get back to 

Central so I could go home, but it 
was a 20-minute bus ride, and I 
had to get off the bus at one point 
to go back to the bathroom,” she 
said. “It was so horrible, it was a 
traumatic experience, and then I 
thought: ‘What if this happened 
to someone with a mental 
illness? What if someone had a 
surprise anxiety attack and they 
were on North Campus?’ You 
(would) have to get on a crowded 
Blue Bus and ride 20 minutes to 
get home. It’s so hard; we need 
something up here.”

Other issues discussed include 

the fact that many students are 
aware of the resources CAPS 
provide but may choose not to 
seek them out because of previous 
negative 
experiences. 
The 

waiting time for an appointment 
and the business hours were 
issues of concern raised by the 
students.

“It’s really hard for students 

to prioritize mental health,” 
Rothman said. “There’s lots of 
insurance issues. We found in the 
data that people have mentioned 
about insurance not covering 

mental health resources, having 
to go to their parents and that 
being 
a 
barrier. 
Something 

that’s very applicable to North 
Campus is just the distance that 
we have from here to CAPS. We 
found that to be a barrier, as 
well as the business hours that 
are associated with CAPS, only 
being open 9 to 5 throughout the 
week.”

According 
to 
the 
CSG 

survey results, 73.6 percent of 
respondents felt professors, GSIs 
and lecturers are moderately 
or very obligated to provide 
accommodation to students with 
mental illnesses.

Attendees broke off into 

groups to discuss this result 
and other barriers surrounding 
those looking to seek support 
on campus, as well as make 
suggestions for the task force 
to improve overall campus 
climate. 
These 
suggestions 

were compiled into a document 
the task force will share with 
University 
administration, 

specifically hoping to increase 
the effectiveness of student-
professor 
interactions 

both inside and outside the 
classroom.

care providers and researchers, 
especially in light of the possible 
revocation of former President 
Barack Obama’s health care law.

Trosvig said the most important 

aspect of her position, especially 
concerning the interaction between 
IT and research, is constant review 
of the utility of programs.

“You can’t say, ‘this is a great 

service’ and leave it,” Trosvig said. 
“You need to do assessments every 
two or three years, say ‘is this still 
cost effective? Is this still the same 
way we do it? Is this still the best 
way to do it?’ You need to continually 
assess your services.”

Engineering 
sophomore 
AJ 

Ashman, senior policy advisor for 
Central Student Government, came 
to the meeting to talk about efforts 
to reduce textbook prices.

Ashman presented information 

about his and the University libraries’ 
efforts and answered questions 
concerning library resources that 
attempt to alleviate a portion of the 
cost of college textbooks. One such 
resource that Ashman is working 
to expand is the University Library 
course reserves, which keeps course 
materials on reserves at the library 
for students to use in four-hour 
increments.

Ashman 
said, 
according 
to 

research, about 30 percent of 
students often do not purchase 
textbooks for financial reasons, 
despite the impact that may have on 
their performance in the course.

“Textbooks are a hidden cost 

of college, but they’re crucial to 
succeeding,” he said. “And if we’re 
going to be taking kids here who 
are socioeconomically of lower 
statuses, we’re not giving them 
that opportunity without the books 
to succeed in the class … We’re 
really pricing kids out of a quality 
education.”

Ashman also discussed efforts 

to incorporate programs similar to 
those at the University of Indiana, 
which include increased usage of 
online textbooks at a lower cost to 
students.

He said these efforts represent 

the libraries’ efforts to be as relevant 
to students as possible, given the 
prevalence of technology.

“We have all these books on 

the shelves, that’s great,” Ashman 
said. “But are students really using 
them and are we catering to those 
needs? They’re as eager as I am to 
make themselves more relevant to 
students today.”

Ashman appealed to SACUA 

to help spread information about 
library resources to other faculty 
members and students. SACUA 
Chair William Schultz, professor 
of mechanical engineering, agreed, 
requesting specific documents of the 
resources Ashman had in order to 
disseminate the information more 
accurately.

However, 
Community 

Relations 
Director 
Jim 

Kosteva told the Daily in 
a 
previousarticle 
that 
the 

Council’s decision to cull is 
supported by ample scientific 
evidence, 
an 
opinion 
with 

which 
many 
University 

biologists agree. Kosteva said 
deer grazing has significantly 
damaged University property 
in a way that is environmentally 
and financially unsustainable.

“The Nichols Arboretum, 

which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 

a 
showcase 
and 
living 

laboratory of diverse species, 
has been unable to establish 
many seedlings due to the 
overgrazing of the deer herd,” 
Kosteva wrote. “The University 

has also incurred a significant 
loss of landscape materials, 
particularly on North Campus, 
that have been consumed or 
damaged by deer. Replacing 
that material has required a 
costly diversion of funds that 
otherwise could support more 
mission centered activities.”

The protesters gathered at 

the corner of North University 
Avenue and State Street, and 
made their way across the Diag 
to the Arboretum chanting, 
“Hey hey, ho ho, U of M deer 
cull’s got to go” and, “Stop the 
shoot in the Arb.” 

Sergio 
Muniz, 

Transportation 
Research 

Institute visiting scholar, said 
in Brazil where he is from, 
people are against lethal animal 
control and wished to see that 
attitude grow in Ann Arbor.

“Our animals have the right 

to life and peace,” Muniz said. 

“In Brazil, hunting is illegal … 
There and here, we have the 
same concerns about hunting. 
It’s not the best way to keep 
nature safe and healthy.”

When the protesters reached 

the Arboretum, they formed 
a circle passed around LED 
candles and sang “We Shall 
Overcome,”

FAAWN member Nirmala 

Hanke 
read 
a 
speech 

condemning the University’s 
decision to allow the cull and 
criticized what she saw as 
inadequate safety procedures 
for students.

“We have, as human beings, 

created the problem of taking 
away the deer habitats with all 
of our development,” Hanke 
said.

FROM THE DAILY

Standing with our students
L

ast Friday, Jan. 27, President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring 
the immigration of people from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days, 
suspending most refugee resettlement for 120 days and indefinitely barring the 

resettlement of all eligible Syrian refugees in the United States. The affected countries 
include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The controversial order 
has resulted in much backlash from various groups, including religious organizations, 
academics and tech companies. It has also stirred fear and uncertainty among Muslim 
and international communities. In response to this order, University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel issued a statement emphasizing the University’s commitment 
to protecting all its students — both domestic and international — despite pressure 
from the federal government. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board commends the 
University’s prompt statement following the executive order and stands in solidarity 
with our University’s students and staff who are affected by this ban.

“T

his American Life” 
recently broadcasted 
a 
piece 
on 
the 

DeploraBall, an alt-right party 
celebrating 
President 

Donald 
Trump’s 

inauguration. At one 
point, 
Zoe 
Chace, 

“This American Life” 
producer, 
begins 

questioning an attendee 
about why they retweet 
David Duke, former 
Imperial Wizard of the 
Ku Klux Klan, despite 
claiming to disagree 
with what he says. One 
answer came up again and again. 
To the attendees, Duke is a troll. He 
doesn’t actually believe that Jewish 
people secretly control the global 
government or that all Mexicans 
should be deported. He just wants 
to rile people up. It’s a comment on 
freedom of speech. Duke is really 
fighting against the boogeyman of 
political correctness.

I think there are many factors 

at play here. Our nation’s failure 
to have a continuous conversation 
on civil rights since the 1960s has 
helped create an environment 
where racism is seen as a relic 
and racist sentiments are only 
expressed ironically. Additionally, 
communities 
have 
become 

increasingly segregated so these 
people can’t put a face to their 
rhetoric. But, more importantly, it’s 
emblematic of the way that people 
on the far right have co-opted civil 
rights discourse to their own ends. 
At times, this has been explicit. Sen. 
Ted Cruz (R–Texas) once claimed 
that school choice is the “civil rights 
issue of the 21st century.” It goes 
without saying that he’s actively 
opposed issues supported by actual 

activists, like policing reform and 
protecting our LGBTQ citizens.

However, 
this 
appropriation 

of civil rights rhetoric happens in 

much more nefarious 
ways. 
Controversial 

public 
figure 
Milo 

Yiannopoulos’ 
book 

“Dangerous” 
is 

advertised in Amazon’s 
censorship section, next 
to activists who have 
been 
imprisoned 
by 

oppressive regimes for 
their 
anti-totalitarian 

writings. 
What 
has 

Yiannopoulos sacrificed 

for his beliefs? Well, he’s been banned 
from Twitter after helping launch a 
racist harassment campaign against 
“Ghostbusters” actor Leslie Jones.

Yiannopoulos’ 
understanding 

of Twitter bans is best expressed 
in this tweet: “Easiest way to 
get banned on Twitter: criticise 
or ridicule feminism or Black 
Lives Matter. This is political.” 
Obviously, people should have the 
right to critique those movements, 
and societies have often benefited 
from gadflies who relentlessly 
question that which we hold 
sacred. But Yiannopoulos has 
no interest in that. He wants to 
destroy individuals with whom he 
disagrees. Yiannopoulos is a bully 
and it’s easy to stand up to one 
bully but not hundreds of faceless 
Twitter accounts.

This anti-democratic tendency to 

use freedom of speech, and Twitter 
in particular, as a cudgel against 
political opponents is epitomized by 
Trump. One of the most disturbing 
things on the campaign trail last 
year was when Trump was asked 
a tough question at a town hall 
meeting by a private citizen, Lauren 

Batchelder, and he chose to retaliate 
by erroneously claiming she was 
a plant by the Jeb Bush campaign. 
Afterward, 
throngs 
of 
Trump 

supporters dug up Batchelder’s 
personal contact information, a tactic 
known as “doxing.” She received 
death threats daily.

To people truly concerned about 

freedom of speech, this should be 
extremely worrying. People are 
going to have second thoughts 
about publicly disagreeing with 
our president and members of the 
alt-right after seeing this terrifying 
troll fusillade. As the saying goes, 
your freedoms end where another’s 
begin. Harassment is not protected 
by the First Amendment, and it 
presents a threat to our democracy 
by making people feel physically 
unsafe expressing their political 
opinions. I’m not calling for our 
entire society to become a safe 
space or for weaker protections of 
freedom of speech; I’m calling for 
the ones that exist to be enforced.

More than any other pillar of 

political rights, freedom of speech 
has been hijacked by figures such 
as Yiannopoulos. By framing their 
actions as an attack on political 
correctness, they find an audience 
far beyond their white nationalist 
clique. All rights have limits and 
speech is no exception. However, 
society will only reject odious 
hate speech once it understands 
that 
these 
“provocateurs” 
are 

anything but. Sunshine is the best 
disinfectant, and revealing the true 
nature of the alt-right’s hate speech 
is the best way to undermine its 
claims as the vanguard of freedom 
of speech.

M

y dad has a saying 
he used to preach to 
me and my brothers: 

“Knowledge is power.” 
Often shortened to 
the acronym “KIP,” 
every 
repetition 
of 

the 
phrase 
invited 

an annoyed look and 
eye roll from me. Yet, 
as I grew older and 
realized my father 
wasn’t 
as 
clueless 

as 
my 
seven-year-

old self thought him 
to be, I began to 
experience the true importance 
and relevance of what he meant.

I went to a public school in 

suburban Cincinnati, and because 
of the three lines of my address, it 
happened to be a highly-funded 
one, dubbed a “good” public 
school. 
Because 
of 
property 

taxes and a legacy of supporting 
teachers, the district I grew up 
in was a true testament to the 
power of public education. There 
was diversity in every shape and 
form: 
socioeconomic 
status, 

race, background, interests, etc. 
Passing our city’s levy was never 
an issue and funding to the 
arts, though arguably less than 
sports, was still significant. Our 
graduation rate never faltered 
below 90 percent, and test 
scores were always at or above 
average. My high school, in 
short, was the epitome of a 
quality public education.

My school district provided 

me with experiences that I could 
talk about on my college essays, 
allowing me to directly answer the 
common and overused question 
of how I participated in activities 
“both inside and outside the 
classroom.” I had the opportunity 
to get involved in numerous sports 
teams and arts programs while at 
the same time taking AP classes 
and cultivating a passion for 
learning. I was subsequently able 
to apply to and attend a prestigious 
university 
and 
continue 
my 

education in the hopes of pursuing 
a career of my choice.

My education story may be 

similar to your own, but for many 
others, education is plagued 
with inequality. The disparity in 
the public school system makes 
education no longer a strength 
for the future but a liability, 
and 
Betsy 
DeVos’s 
pending 

confirmation as the Secretary of 
Education is not a remedy for the 
situation, but an aggravator. 

The 
Daily 
published 

an 
editorial 
last 
semester 

denouncing DeVos’s involvement 
in Detroit’s public school system 
and the danger of her policy 

tactics on improving 
public education post-
nomination. 
I 
echo 

these sentiments, and 
as a product of the 
public school system, 
I echo them fervently. 
Betsy 
DeVos 
has 

long been an ardent 
supporter of privatizing 
education in the form 
of 
charter 
schools 

and 
vouchers. 
Her 

approach to education is one 
that focuses on public school 
alternatives, instead of public 
schools 
themselves. 
DeVos 

has financially supported and 
pioneered 
numerous 
school 

choice 
ventures, 
including 

lobbying groups and voucher 
programs. But her approach 
to education reform, like the 
approaches of many others, is 
ignoring a vital component of 
education — teachers.

I attended a great public 

school, but what made my 
education powerful was the 
quality of teaching I had along 
the 
way. 
Education 
reform 

has been focused on relieving 
inequality through funding and 
the wages of teachers, but always 
seems to disregard inequality 
in teaching quality. DeVos’s 
support of privatization is taking 
a political and financial stance 
on reform but ignoring other 
vital parts of education policy: 
the men and women at the front 
of the classroom. 

The 
number 
of 
students 

enrolled in public schools is set 
to increase by 3 percent to 51.4 
million students in 2025. The 
National Center for Education 
Statistics 
shows 
individual 

state enrollment is projected to 
increase by even more. Granted, 
some states will see a lowering 
in enrollment, but the general 
trend shows a shift toward an 
increased number of students 
in public schools. This growing 
number of students in public 
education means the vital and 
impactful 
student-teacher 

interactions will increase. While 
DeVos sees school choice in the 
form of charter schools and 
vouchers as a way to mitigate 
inequality in education, her 
aversion 
to 
improving 
the 

fundamental problems of public 
schools is detrimental. 

Instead of facing the everyday 

issues 
of 
public 
schools, 

particularly those in inner-city 
districts, the nominee has a 
track record of pouring billions 
of 
dollars 
into 
alternative 

educational systems. But now 
isn’t the time to jump ship, 
even if the ship is leaky. No, 
now is the time to patch it up. 
However, with a captain like 
DeVos, abandoning ship seems 
more her style. The broadcasted 
confirmation hearing proved her 
lack of experience in the field of 
education. I, myself, and many of 
you, have more experience when 
it comes to public education 
than the woman who has been 
nominated to reform the system.

Yet, regardless of who is leading 

reform, the quality of teachers has 
never been a focused component 
of 
policy. 
Monetary 
funding 

is a policy lever that is sure to 
alleviate those failing public 
schools, but improving teacher 
preparation programs could do 
so as well. What I learned through 
my education was powerful, yet 
much of the power came from 
the interactions I had with my 
teachers. Each one, regardless of 
whether I conventionally liked 
them or not, was qualified and 
driven in what they did.

The downward death spiral 

of public schools in inner cities 
begins when the most unqualified 
teachers are hired at schools 
because 
of 
underemployment. 

Unlike, 
say, 
medical 
school, 

teacher 
preparation 
programs 

are not uniform. There is a lack 
of 
thorough 
standardization 

between programs, resulting in 
some of the teaching force being 
underprepared for the classroom. 
A recent Department of Education 
initiative stressed the idea of 
improving teacher preparation as 
a gateway to improving student 
achievement. A policy that looks 
beyond simply increasing funding 
but also at the teachers we are 
putting in classrooms is one that 
could have dramatic effects.

While 
DeVos’s 
nomination 

is 
a 
fundamental 
threat 
to 

public schools, at a deeper level 
it is a threat to empowering 
all 
American 
students 
with 

knowledge. As my dad would say, 
“knowledge is power,” and by 
disregarding the power a good 
public school can have and further 
abandoning improvement of the 
traditional system altogether, 
DeVos’s policy approach will 
make education a weakness.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

W

ait, President Donald 
Trump 
didn’t 
just 

use a quote from 

“Bee Movie” in his 
inauguration speech, 
did 
he? 
Barry 
B. 

Benson, one of the bees 
in the Bee Movie, and 
the president’s images 
were 
side 
by 
side 

with a supposed “Bee 
Movie” quote below: 
“We are one colony — 
and their pain is our 
pain. Their dreams are 
our dreams; and their 
success will be our 
success. We share one heart, one 
hive, and one glorious destiny.” It 
looked like Trump just replaced 
the word “colony” with “nation” 
and “hive” with “home.” No, this 
was a complete hoax.

Around the same time, there 

was an uproar of a dog being put 
in rushing water on the set of 
the film, “A Dog’s Purpose.” The 
dog was seen being put in the 
water by a trainer, and it looked 
like the dog was uncomfortable. 
Later, we see the dog swimming 
in the water. But it turns out that 
the clips were cut and from two 
totally different time periods. 
The video was shot over a year 
ago and is just now (right before 
the movie’s premiere) being 
brought 
into 
the 
spotlight. 

Claims of animal cruelty were 
deemed false because the trainer 
was just trying to acclimate the 
dog to the water, and the trainer 
didn’t put him in the water that 
day. The clip of the dog in the 
water was from later during 
the filming when the dog was 
actually comfortable.

Many people shared these two 

“stories” before the truth came 
out and believed them as real. 
It isn’t their own fault. Many 
journalists and other people want 
to get their two cents in first, 

without digging in a little deeper 
to see if they’re actually facts. In 
some news cycles, there’s more 

emphasis on having 
the scoop instead of 
getting it completely 
right. I almost fell for 
them myself, but did 
a little more research 
because 
I’ve 
been 

bamboozled before.

The overwhelming 

presence 
of 
fake 

news in our society 
is 
destroying 
the 

reputability 
and 

the prestige of the 

journalism 
profession. 
For 

example, 
Sean 
Spicer, 
White 

House press secretary, can claim 
that Trump’s inauguration was 
the most watched in person and 
on television, when the most 
viewed in person title belongs to 
former President Barack Obama 
and the most television viewers 
belongs again to Obama, shortly 
followed by former President 
Ronald Reagan. Yes, Reagan 
didn’t have streaming sites like 
Facebook and YouTube, but the 
numbers for Trump’s statistics 
on those sites haven’t even been 
released in full yet. How can you 
make such a claim by ballparking 
and without concrete data?

Both sides of the political 

spectrum can take a hit when the 
opposing side takes a claim from 
someone in power as truth when 
it’s really an “alternative fact.” 
It’s disheartening and downright 
infuriating because some people 
aren’t willing to do the research, 
and even if they did, might not 
be persuaded to think differently 
once they saw the truth. Both 
members of the left and right can 
be guilty of this, and it’s damaging 
to social and political progress.

When fake news or false 

reports accuse someone like 
Trump, it just gives him and 

everyone on his side more fuel 
power. Seriously, what were 
people going to think when 
Buzzfeed released an exposé 
about Trump’s alleged long-time 
ties to Russia when the intel isn’t 
even confirmed? Trump and 
Tomi Lahren, a conservative 
political 
commentator, 
will 

rightfully exclaim that the news 
is fake (even though they have 
said this about accurate stories 
as well). Those claims are true 
because it just isn’t right to make 
a false claim. Doing that lessens 
the power of the actual truth. 
Whomever is accused can deem 
it to be fake, and most who have 
their back will blindly follow 
their lead.

The integrity of news is at 

stake. There are so many sites 
at our disposal that sometimes 
it’s difficult to separate fact from 
fiction. I believe publications such 
as Vox and The New York Times 
do an excellent job of thoughtful 
and in-depth reporting, but it 
takes one site and one wrong 
story going big to lower the 
trustworthiness of a legitimate 
story in someone’s eyes. 

As citizens of the United States, 

with freedom of the press as an 
amendment in our Constitution, 
we deserve nothing but honest 
news. And we have a responsibility 
to do extra research on whatever 
stories we read, especially when 
they involve an arena as important 
as politics. It’s tougher now to 
determine when stories are true 
from looking at just one source 
(especially if it doesn’t have a 
history for being reputable). Do 
your research thoroughly and 
inform others if they don’t have 
their facts straight. Read more 
than the headline. Everything is 
not what it seems.

We applaud Schlissel’s rapid 

and supportive response to the 
harm and worry our University 
community members may have 
experienced as a result of Trump’s 
action. The University’s statement 
reaffirmed its commitment to 
keeping 
students’ 
immigration 

statuses 
private 
and 
refused 

to partner campus police with 
immigration enforcement actions 
— with the exception of when 
absolutely required by law to 
do so. This is an important step 
in reassuring students that the 
University will stand with them in 
these uncertain times. 

Trump’s 
executive 
order 

indicates a larger problem with 
the goals of those leading our 
country. 
It 
is 
fundamentally 

unacceptable to ban a group of 
people from entering the United 
States based on their background. 
We should immediately be taken 
aback by Trump’s actions when 
considering where he stands on 
basic humanitarian grounds and 
also when thinking about the goals 
of our campus community.

It is our job, as students, staff and 

community members, to recognize 
our goals of creating a diverse 
and inclusive campus community 
and actively combat forces that 
work against them. Through the 
language of Schlissel’s statement, 
we see a clear indication of the 
University’s desire to maintain the 
international community that has 
characterized our campus since 
the 1800s, both on and beyond the 
physical boundaries of our campus. 
Banning any group of people from 
entering the country, especially 
refugees, will stunt efforts to 
diversify our University campus, 
making it harder to thrive in an 
international setting and severely 
marginalizing important voices in 
our community.

We stand with all Iranian, 

Iraqi, Libyan, Somali, Sudanese, 
Syrian and Yemeni students, 
refugees 
and 
undocumented 

students 
in 
our 
University 

community who are affected 
by this order. More broadly, 
we stand with members of the 
Muslim, Middle Eastern and North 

African communities who may be 
fearful of future ramifications 
and 
legislation. 
Everyone 

on campus has the right to 
participate in higher education, 
free from fear, regardless of 
their racial, ethnic, national or 
religious background. 

Many 
University 

organizations 
have 
reached 

out 
to 
provide 
students 

with resources and support 
during 
these 
trying 
times.

“I 
hope 
you 
take 
some 

inspiration from it and I hope you 
like it. We about to get this shit 
poppin’.”

Those were some of the last 

words before Big Sean premiered 
his 
fourth 
studio 
album, 
I 

Decided., 
on 
Sunday 
night 

among friends, family and some 
limited press at the Museum 
of Contemporary Art in his 
hometown of Detroit, Michigan.

Despite having been born in 

California, 
the 
twenty-eight 

year-old emcee went on to explain 
that, in reality, he “spent [his] 
entire life in Detroit,” reminding 
the small crowd of the names of 
his old streets and schools. He 
affirmed: “Anytime you see me 
on Jimmy Fallon, or Saturday 
Night Live, or anywhere,” it’s for 
the city.

“This is my fourth studio 

album: I Decided.,” he concluded. 
Then it began.

***

Apparently, 
Big 
Sean 
has 

never before been allowed to 
premiere one of his albums in 
Detroit, as record labels favor 
bigger marketplaces (think New 

York and Los Angeles), a fact 
that added extra weight to the 
live debut of his newest lyrical 
nods at the city, the first of which 
appear no longer than thirty 
seconds into his first verse.

After a tense intro featuring 

a seasoned male voice boasting 
about having worked the same job 
for 45 years, Sean raps over rich, 
moody keys, with his voice as the 
only percussion on the beggining 
of “Light (Ft. Jeremih).” He 
eventually arrives at a heartfelt 
hook (“Even if you take away my 
life / They can’t take away my 
light”) and, finally, an iconic grin 
at his family members (“Got the 
whole city on fire / This the flow 
that finna have my whole family 
retire”), many of whom happened 
to be present in the room.

The third track on the album is 

“Bounce Back,” and Sean added 
a more localized flair to the song 
by cooly announcing, “Detroit’s 
gonna bounce back!” The salute 
was warmly received, and it 
acted as a seamless transition 
into the fourth song, which is 
guaranteed to become a staple 
Detroit anthem. “No Favors,” 
which features Detroit-native 
and rap legend Eminem, turned 
the room up to another level and 
even inspired someone in the 
crowd to yell out, twice: “The 

whole city been waiting on that!”

The fifth song, “Jump Out The 

Window,” is bouncy, so Big Sean 
started walking around the room 
— shifting the crowd’s attention 
away 
from 
the 
carefully-

illuminated area where he had 
rapped 
the 
first 

few tracks aside an 
artificial tree — and 
greeted attendees, 
most of whom he 
seemed genuinely 
personally excited 
to see. He wore all 
black, including a 
blacked out Detroit 
Tigers cap and a 
discretely branded 
I Decided. hoodie. But three 
diamond 
Michigan 
mittens, 

dangling from his neck and 
decorated in different shades of 
gold, brightened up his entire 
ensemble.

Next up was “Moves,” and 

once again the room became 
a 
full-fledged 
party. 
People 

were crowding around Sean, 
obviously, but the energy was still 
more intimate and recreational 
than business-fueled. When the 
album’s singles — which were 
released beforehand and have 
already turned into monstrous 
hits — came on, the room became 
particularly excited as attendees 
rapped every single word, myself 
included.

“This is my favorite song on 

the album,” Big Sean whispered 
to me and a few other fortunate 
journalists standing beside him 
as the seventh song, “Same Time 
Pt. 1 (Ft. TWENTY88),” which 
includes lines about someone 
acting “out of line,” queued up. 
Trapped in complete awe as he 
spat, it looked as if he was still, 
even at the debut of his fourth 
album, nervous everything could 
all go wrong on any note. It never 
did, but Sean writes, performs 
and lives like it might. It’s what 
keeps him grounded, humble 
and, above all else, driven. That 
attitude is stamped all over I 
Decided.

“Halfway Off the Balcony,” 

the heartfelt third single off 
the album, came next. When it 
ended, a slow, eerie, bass-heavy 
beat came on, and Sean began 
rapping along, building around 
the motivated, conscious hook: 
“Voices in my head saying I can 
do it better / Voices in my head 
saying better do it better.” On 
first listen, the track, “Voices In 
My Head,” somewhat parallels 
“Deep (feat. Lil Wayne)” from 
Sean’s third album, Dark Sky 
Paradise.

“Stick to the player hatin’!” 

warns Sean later on the song. On 
the tracklist, there appear to be 
two parts — “Voices In My Head 
/ Stick To The Plan” — and the 
latter half has a turnt-up, trap-
like beat led by long, thick bass 
kicks. Though it acts as the most 
telling predictor of the rowdy 
surprise to come moments later, 
its debut was particularly unique, 
as it is placed right before “Sunday 
Morning Jetpack,” a thankful, 
even spiritual, reflection that 
Big Sean premiered on “Saturday 
Night Live,” and the hyper-
personal twelfth track, “Inspire 

Me,” during which Sean walked 
across the room to seek out his 
mother, then proceeded to rap 
the lyrics to her.

The 
thirteenth 
song, 

“Sacrifices 
(ft. 
Migos)” 
is 

positively 
guaranteed 
to 
be 

a 
monster 
hit. 

I 
wrote 
that 

assumption down 
immediately, 
as 

soon as I heard 
its 
explosive 

drums 
and 
the 

intensity 
in 
Big 

Sean’s voice. But 
once Offset came 
in, 
first 
teasing 

fans 
with 
his 

famous ad-lib, then delivering 
a quintessentially charismatic 
verse before, inevitably, passing 
the microphone to his bandmate 
Quavo, the radio potential for this 
deep cut multiplied immensely.

And 
finally, 
the 
closer, 

“Bigger Than Me.” It features 
a 
meditative, 
reflective, 

monologue-like verse in which 
Sean reminisces about growing 
up in Detroit, going out to see the 
world and, eventually, returning 
home as an older, wiser man. 
“That’s when I realized, shit’s 
bigger than me,” he admits, 
expressing 
his 
spirituality 

through 
the 
chillingly 
real 

confession: “God talking to me 
telepathically, like it only happen 
if you let it.” Maybe that’s what 
Big Sean Decided.

Eventually, 
the 
collective 

voices of the Chozen Choir from 
Flint, Michigan arrived, adding 
purely childish ambition to the 
track. But even this inspiring 
feature doesn’t distract from 
the album’s emotional grand 
finale: a voice recording I expect 
belongs to Sean’s mother. In 
the final moments of I Decided., 
Myra Anderson tells her son she 
loves him, and expressing her 
pride before concluding with a 
humanizing anecdote. All of the 
above things are still true, she 
says, “even when you do stupid 
things that I warned you about…”

***

In his short speech following 

the premiere, Sean called it, 
“By far my best album,” and 
then 
again 
emphasized 
his 

unswerving loyalty to Detroit, 
noting: “There’s not a lot of 
people in my position, so I’ll keep 
kicking down doors.”

He is dead serious. On first 

listen, I Decided. comes across 
as 
his 
most 
finely-tuned, 

thematically 
cohesive 
project 

yet. Its tracks bear the wisdom 
and maturity of an aging, well-
experienced man, but still prove 
unwilling to sacrifice energy and 
hunger.

As far as the whole Detroit 

thing goes — Sean has already 
done almost everything but run 
for mayor. He has been vocally 
representing it for years with 
localized slang, and even named 
his critically-acclaimed mixtape 
from 2012, Detroit, after the city.

Now, Big Sean finally premiers 

a studio album in his hometown. 
Michiganders can return the 
favor by listening to I Decided., 
out this Friday.

VALENTINO

Valentino’s Spring 2017 Couture 

show marked the first collection for 
Pierpaolo Piccioli post-departure 
from his 25-year-long co-designer, 
Maria Grazia Chiuri. He turned 
to mythology for inspiration. The 
result? A collection shaped around 
Greek goddesses.

Using Greek goddesses as a 

source of inspiration is far from 
novel. Countless collections have 
called upon the Greek muses as a 
basis for their aesthetic. However, 
for a defining collection from a 
very Italian designer of a very Ital-
ian brand, this was not only a stra-
tegic choice but an effortless fit.

Recently, the landscape of haute 

couture has been marked by great 
volatility — the head designers play 
a complex game of musical chairs, 

hopping from fashion house to 
fashion house. As the designers 
fluctuate, so too do the core com-
plexions of the brands. By basing 
his collection on goddesses, Pic-
cioli was making a declaration that 
he does not intend to digress from 
the ethereal femininity that Valen-
tino has championed for the past 
several decades.

Ultimately, it is not the inspi-

ration that delineates a collection 
but rather the designer’s execu-
tion. Piccioli pledged himself to 
his celestial inspiration, naming 
every look after legitimate Greek 
mythological figures and incor-
porating details from their nar-
ratives into the individual pieces. 
The result — a collection that was 
radiant and surprisingly intellec-
tual.

Look 45: Titled Pasithea, one 

of the Graces. Daughter of Zeus 
and wife of Hypnos, Pasithea 

was the goddess of relaxation 
and meditation. This manifests 
in the dress’ elegant simplicity, 
a comparatively relaxed dress 
in conjunction with the more 
ornate looks.

Look 47: Named Pandora, 

after the famous first human. 
Infamous for her accidental 
introduction of evil into the 
world, Piccioli opted for a literal 
interpretation of his inspiration, 
Pandora herself is hand-embroi-
dered on the left side of the gar-
ment in a golden orange thread.

Look 50: Christened Arethu-

sa. Arethusa was a nymph who 
was transfigured into a flowing 
spring, surrounded by flowers. 
The piece has an elongated stripe 
which originates below the neck-
line and extends to the floor. Sur-
rounding the stripe are macramé 
flowers, much like flowers sur-
rounding a stream.

Valentino’s Piccioli returns to roots 
for first solo couture collection 

Drawing from Greco-Roman stlyes, recent collections proves radiant

On 
January 
21st, 
millions 

marched. 
They 
marched 

specifically 
against 
Donald 

Trump’s behavior, rhetoric and 
inauguration, 
and 
marched 

in solidarity around the globe 
against the treatment of women 
worldwide. The march aimed to 
be as intersectional as possible, 
marching not just to bring light 
to the struggles of “women” as a 
single category but to acknowledge 
that different women face different 
struggles. Some think this was 
more successful than others; I’ve 
been trying to listen to what others 
have to say about it.

I’ve seen a lot of people 

struggling with what they saw 
as a focus on the celebration of 
“womanhood.” Many felt that 
some of the popular signs featuring 
images, cartoons or language 
around female reproductive organs 
or primary sex characteristics — 
not to mention the pink hats — were 
alienating to the trans women who 
showed up to march. Much of the 
coverage of the marches addressed 
how centering this kind of imagery 
and rhetoric catered exclusively to 
cis women. For anyone who doesn’t 
know, the definition of cisgender 
(according to Merriam-Webster) 
is: “relating to, or being a person 
whose gender identity corresponds 
with the sex the person had or was 
identified as having at birth.”

Transgender people face issues 

that cisgender people do not. 
Cisgender people don’t have to 
worry they won’t be allowed to 
use the bathroom they feel most 
comfortable using, or have people 
argue with them about what their 
“real” name is or face insistent 
questioning of what’s under their 
clothes or worry about being 
misgendered or scroll through a 
category on Netflix and not see any 
movies that represent them and 
their experiences. These are just a 
few I know, but the list goes on and 
on — and there are plenty of lists 
and personal narratives out there 
written by transgender people who 
have faced discrimination based on 
their gender identity firsthand.

From what I could see, there 

were two conflations in both the 
rhetoric around the march and the 
criticism of it afterwards that were 
getting in the way of productive 
conversations. The first is a 
distinction which has only recently 
trickled into common knowledge, 
and that many people haven’t 
come across in an academic setting 
because we don’t teach anything 
about it until college (at least in 
my experience): the conflation of 
sex and gender. A quick, simplistic 
crash course for those who haven’t 

encountered this idea: Sex is what 
one is assigned at birth based on 
genitalia and reproductive organs, 
either male and female. Gender is 
the social construct built around 
sex: boy and girl, man and woman. 
The concept that gender is a social 
construct — that there is nothing 
inherent to “womanhood” or 
“manhood” can be flooring the 
first time one learns about it, and 
still hasn’t quite reached public 
acceptance.

The second conflation I saw 

was of the privilege of cisgender 
women and having a female body. 
I think that cisgender privilege 
is often just named in a list with 
other privileges, and not actually 
examined enough on its own. 
I think that’s led to some not 
understanding that the privilege 
ciswomen have is not actually 
related to inhabiting a female body; 
in this case, having female genitalia 

and female primary and secondary 
sex characteristics has never been 
a privileged identity. They have 
always been abused and harshly 
regulated, from the history of 
sterilization of indigenous women 
and “corrective” rape of queer 
women, to the disbelief of the 
female orgasm and the marketing 
of douching for “freshness” or 
“cleanliness,” to the inaccessibility 
and harsh restriction of birth 
control, to the ancient societal 
importance placed on virginity tied 
to hymens and the perpetuation of 
rape culture. The list goes on and 
on.

In a lot of spaces, talking about 

the pain and struggle that comes 
along with owning a uterus or 
vagina is still taboo — for example, 
former Rep. Lisa Brown (D – West 
Bloomfield) was barred from 
speaking after she used the word 
“vagina” in a discussion about 
abortion. That was in 2012. A 
few days ago, Trump reinstated 
the “global gag rule,” making 
accurate and informed family 
planning aid (specifically abortion) 
to 
other 
countries 
incredibly 

difficult. There were examples of 
internalized misogyny even at the 
women’s march; I saw one sign at 
the Ann Arbor march that read: “I 

may have one, but I’m no pussy.” I 
don’t even know where to begin 
with it.

A lot of these issues don’t occur 

to those who don’t struggle with 
them on a daily basis. When I was 
in high school, I was involved in my 
school’s “midnight runs,” Friday 
nights spent driving all over New 
York City to give food, clothes and 
toiletries to homeless people on 
the streets. We collected donations 
from 
students 
beforehand 
— 

toothpaste, deodorant, soap and 
shampoo. The one thing that 
most of the homeless women 
asked for first was tampons and 
pads, which we never had. It just 
wasn’t something people thought 
to donate — which was especially 
interesting considering it was an 
all-girls school. New York only 
stopped taxing menstrual products 
last year.

Signs at the women’s marches 

that had pictures of uteruses or 
vaginas weren’t inherently trans 
exclusive. They were in direct 
response to not only several of you-
know-who’s comments about and 
lack of respect towards women, 
most infamously, his “grab them by 
the p——y” comment.

There were signs at the march 

that were trans exclusionary — 
“the future is female,” sign, or “no 
uterus, no opinion,” — but they 
were more than that, for anything 
that reifies the conflation between 
sex and gender is dangerous and 
counterproductive. These signs 
should not be seen as celebrating 
these symbols as inherent to 
womanhood, but rather a way to 
reclaim the space and time needed 
to fix the issues faced by those 
who have them. I don’t think the 
solution would’ve been to not 
have those signs; these things 
can’t be taken out of the national 
conversation. Rather, there should 
have been more signs about the 
issues that transgender people, 
both transgender men and women, 
face. The conversation needs to be 
broadened and amplified, and the 
conversation 
around 
cisgender 

privilege more focused so as to 
eliminate the confusion.

There is nothing inherent to 

“womanhood.” The term itself 
is dubious. Sometimes it seems 
like the only thing that all women 
have in common is some level 
of oppression, no matter how 
complicated or tiered. I guess 
that’s part of the reason, beyond its 
inherent conflation, that I cringe 
a little inside whenever I see signs 
saying “the future is female.” I can’t 
help but think to myself, based on 
how “female” is treated still — God, 
I hope not.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

In the summer of 2014, sixth-

graders 
Morgan 
Geyser 
and 

Anissa Weier lured their friend, 
Payton Leutner, into the woods 
and stabbed her 19 times. When 
they were arrested, they claimed 
they committed the act in an 
attempt to become proxies, or 
servants, of the Slenderman, a 
fictional demonic entity with its 
roots in Internet forums and fan 
fiction. The story dominated the 
news for weeks, and for many the 
incident raised questions of the 
impact that the Internet can have 
on children. It is from this story 
that the new documentary from 
Irene Taylor Brodsky (“The Final 
Inch”), “Beware the Slenderman,” 
emerges, using its terrifying base 
story to explore both the events of 
the “Slender Man Stabbing” and 
the effect of loneliness on young 
people.

From 
its 
opening 
scenes, 

the strengths of “Beware the 
Slenderman” become apparent. 
Its 
story 
is 
as 
consistently 

engrossing as any true-crime 
tale, and in many ways, it recalls 
“Making a Murderer” and fellow 
HBO documentary “The Jinx.” 
Its story is inherently interesting 
and horrifying, and Brodsky does 
well in threading the initial police 
interviews with the girls through 

the film to produce a constantly 
eerie 
atmosphere. 
The 
girls’ 

description of the events leading 
up to the stabbing, as well as the 
stabbing itself, provide some of 
the most chilling material of the 
feature.

It also becomes immediately 

clear what the pitfalls of the 
project 
are. 

Both 
of 
the 

aforementioned 
documentaries 
were series. They 
had an episodic 
format that assisted 
in expositing every 
aspect 
of 
their 

stories. “Beware the Slenderman” 
has to get the same amount of 
information across, but it only 
has a two-hour runtime to do so. 
It is trying to tell so many stories 
at once that something always 
inevitably gets lost, causing a 
disjoint, especially in the first 
act. Here, much of the crime is 
explained, but the lack of info on 
the titular monster which would 
take the brunt of the blame in the 
media, leaves this part feeling 
unfinished. Without motivation, it 
is hard to completely understand 
the story Brodsky is trying to tell.

After the loads of exposition 

that bog down the first act, the 
second portion dives into both the 
lore of the Slenderman and the 
themes of the documentary. One of 
the variety of experts interviewed 

states that the Internet “can serve 
as a peer or peer group” to those 
with few friends of their own, 
and that the Slenderman itself 
gains his followers through their 
own loneliness. It is the picture 
of this isolation that “Beware the 
Slenderman” paints that begins 
to tie the thing together, as it 

draws 
parallels 

from the allure of 
the Internet, and 
Slender 
Man 
in 

particular, to the 
solitude of Weier 
and 
Geyser’s 

personal 
lives. 

It never seeks to 

make excuses for their actions, 
but it does seek to explain them, 
and in this, it succeeds.

In the same way, Brodsky seeks 

the origins of the Slenderman and 
explores the role of the Internet 
in creating web-based horror 
stories, or “creepypasta,” like 
the story of the creature. She 
draws a line from “Slender” to the 
Internet culture of memes to the 
classic folk lore of the Pied Piper, 
and makes it clear that while the 
Internet provided a breeding 
ground for these ideas to multiply 
at a faster rate, the concept has 
been around for centuries. In the 
end, in the film’s most chilling 
segment, it is revealed that Weier 
and Geyser have themselves 
become a part of the Slenderman 
legend.

FILM REVIEW

Iranian-American director Ana’ 

Lily Amirpour once said she con-
ceived the idea for her debut film, 
the vampire thriller “A Girl Walks 
Home Alone At Night,” while 
skateboarding down West Coast 
streets one night. As her black 
chador whipped behind her like 
the wings of a bat, Amirpour had a 
vision of heroine: A young Iranian 
girl who skateboarded around the 
streets of the fictional Bad Town, 
her chador rippling behind her like 
a cape.

Through combining traditional 

and modern elements of Iranian 
culture, as well as including both 
Western and Eastern influences, 
Amirpour creates a masterpiece 
that transcends all previously 
drawn boundaries. “A Girl Walks 
Home Alone At Night” is a melting 
pot of influences, seen in the pair-
ing of chador and fangs, seen in 
the Iranian tattoos on a crass pimp 
and, most importantly, seen in the 
soundtrack itself.

Contrasting the stark, noir 

aspect of the entirely black and 
white movie, the soundtrack of 
“A Girl” is an eclectic mash-up of 
Iranian songs, both old and new. 
Novel Iranian bands like Radio 
Tehran and Kiosk stand next to 
classic singers like Dariush; it’s a 
playlist that not only beautifully 
melds past and present, but also 
shapes the fictional world of “Bad 
Town.”

Much like its lack of color, “A 

Girl” lacks excessive dialogue, 
choosing instead to let its charac-
ters speak through the music that 
fills the negative space.

The main character, The Girl 

(played by Sheila Vand), is a point-
ed collection of contradictions: 
She is mostly silent, entrapped in 
shadows, yet the music that accom-
panies her pays homage to vibrant 
‘80s synthpop. At the beginning 
of the film, The Girl dances alone 
in her room while Farah’s “Danc-
ing Girls” plays; the song contains 
both Farsi and English lyrics, yet 
the techno wave of its background 
melody, along with the lone disco 
ball The Girl sways back and forth 
under, is reminiscent of American 
bands like a-ha and Blondie. Far-
ah’s lyrics — “she’s just a normal 
girl / dancing to her favorite song” 
— create a sense of intimacy and 
vulnerability at odds with the fan-

tastical vampire nightmare.

Even though the scene contains 

no dialogue, it speaks volumes 
about The Girl. Its contrasting 
components 
divulge 
a 
multi-

dimensional character who moves 
past the flat trope of the stereo-
typical horror movie monster. 
Instead, we get a vampire who puts 
on makeup surrounded by muted 
fairy lights and saves abused pros-
titutes, then brutally murders an 
insolent pimp.

The soundtrack is not just a 

voice for the characters, but a 
shape for the movie as a whole. 
The largely instrumental band Fer-
derale makes several appearances 
throughout the film. The Amer-
ican-based ensemble is heavily 
influenced by soundtracks from the 
’60s & ’70s era of Italian “Spaghetti 
Western” genres and, through this, 
allows “A Girl” to transcend cultur-
al boundaries. Songs like “Sarcoph-
agus” and “Black Sunday” feature 
dramatic orchestral declarations, 
bringing to mind the theatrical 
standoffs of iconic Old Westerns, 
while the underpinnings of folk 
melodies speak to conventional 
Iranian films. A spectral woman’s 
voice is often intermittently added 
as a glossy layer over the entire 
compilation; its echoing European 
opera sound traces the barren des-
ert setting in fine lines of elegance.

Ferderale’s “Sisyphus” narrates 

a relatively simple, but quintes-
sential, scene within the film: An 
unnamed character in drag dances 
with a balloon to music in a court-
yard. The fringe on her button-
down shirt and ostentatious silver 
buckle of her belt is at odds with 
the hijab on her head. It’s a strange 
juxtaposition replicated in the song 
as it weaves together musical ele-
ments from a variety of different 
eras.

The band allows the fictional 

Bad Town to exist within multiple 
spheres, blurring the lines between 
distinct movie genres and distinct 
cultures. It’s a quiet gesture, this 
remix of convention to include 
input from other cultures, but a 
powerful one. With “A Girl Walks 
Home Alone At Night,” Amirpour 
constructs a story without limita-
tions; instead, it masterfully tra-
verses the rift between Eastern 
and Western ideals and finds a way 
to mend the disconnect.

What it means to me as an Ira-

nian woman, more than just as 
a good horror movie, more than 
even a movie empowering Iranian 

women, is that it celebrates the 
power of opportunity. It’s doubtful 
Amirpour would have been able to 
create a movie of this magnitude if 
her family had remained in Iran, 
instead of taking the chance to 
immigrate to Europe and, later, to 
California.

Even though Iran’s culture is 

based predominantly around the 
arts — seen in the timeless impact 
of poets like Hafiz and Saadi — its 
current political climate has an 
iron grip around the advancement 
of artistic expression; it places tight 
restrictions over any creative pro-
duction, not allowing for deviation 
from the established norm.

Many of the artists featured on 

this soundtrack, though Iranian-
based, produce and perform their 
music outside of Iran; the radi-
cal socio-political commentary 
found in the lyrics of songs from 
bands like Kiosk or Radio Teh-
ran is explicitly forbidden in Iran. 
Instead of remaining silent, they 
chose to immigrate to Europe, 
Canada and (mainly) the U.S, 
becoming the voice of a majority of 
Iran’s younger generation and per-
mitting Iranian culture to continue 
to progress.

In light of President Donald 

Trump’s recent ban on travel on 
seven Muslim-majority countries 
(Iran being one of them), pieces of 
art like “A Girl Walks Home Alone 
At Night” and its soundtrack need 
attention: The future of Iran lies 
within the ideas of its youth. When 
young Iranian citizens emigrate 
to search for new prospects, they 
are not fleeing from the historic 
culture of their homeland. Rather, 
their innovative ideas push the cul-
ture to evolve in order to accommo-
date new perspectives, redefining 
what it means to be Iranian.

With 
its 
multifaceted 

soundtrack, “A Girl Walks Home 
Alone At Night” represents the 
endlessly creative potential of the 
Iranian youth.

It’s an ingenuity that I saw 

whenever I strolled the streets in 
Iran: Young artists with revolu-
tionary ideas on the brink of look-
ing to make a life for themselves, 
many of them exploring the option 
of moving to America. And even 
though the ethnocentrism in the 
continuing view of America as “the 
land of opportunity” is a problem 
in itself, it does not draw away from 
the fact that, for many bright stu-
dents, closed borders means closed 
opportunities as well.

‘A Girl Walks Home Alone’

PBS

“Divorced, beheaded, died, 

divorced, beheaded, survived.”

“Secrets of the Six Wives,” a 

new HBO historical documen-
tary series, begins with this 
schoolyard rhyme that helps 
remember the fates of the six 
wives of Henry VIII. The pre-
miere 
episode, 
“Divorced,” 

gives an account of the first 
action Henry VIII takes once 
crowned: marrying his late 
brother’s Spanish widow, Cath-
erine of Aragon, born to Queen 
Isabella and King Ferdinand. 
The show alternates between 
documentary 
narration 
by 

historian Dr. Lucy Worsley 
and dramatic reenactments of 
scenes from the Tudor Court, 
often 
based 
on 
eyewitness 

accounts. While Worsley her-
self is a captivating storyteller, 
the style and format of the show 
often pull focus from the actual 
content.

“This is the ultimate true 

story of love, loss and betrayal,” 
Worsley begins, her tale chroni-
cling the anything but meet-
cute of Catherine and Henry 
VIII. She details their relation-
ship’s arc from start to finish, 
talking about the seven years 
it took to nail down a marriage 
contract 
and 
incorporating 

the 
successive 
relationships 

between the king, the “viva-
cious” Mary Boleyn and then, 
more famously, her sister Anne. 
She frames Catherine’s appeal 
to the Pope during Henry’s bat-
tle for the annulment as an act 
of brave defiance.

The historical reenactment is 

slowly paced, with lots of smol-
dering glances from the king 
and concerned facial expres-
sions from all the 
ladies-in-waiting 
surrounding 
the 

various 
queens. 

Worsley herself is 
dressed as a maid 
or lady-in-waiting, 
in the background 
of several of the 
dramatic reenact-
ments before turn-
ing to address the 
audience 
directly 

after 
a 
scene. 

Much of the dialogue is cringe-
worthy, especially the parts 
surrounding pregnancy.

“Secrets of the Six Wives” 

breaks the norm of how this 
story is usually told: Instead of 
focusing on the whims and tan-
trums of Henry VIII, the show 
attempts to tell the story from 
the perspectives of the women 
unlucky enough to be pulled 
into his orbit. Worsley’s nar-
ration is succinct and insight-
ful; she offers well-thought-out 

interpretations of interactions 
and 
events, 
especially 
sur-

rounding Catherine of Aragon’s 
false, or phantom, pregnancy, 
the truth of which is still up for 
debate. She also offers insight 
into aspects of 16th century 
England that tie into the cur-
rent day, talking in front of 
palaces and often using paint-
ings of the six wives as props 
in her storytelling. However, 

the 
switching 

between dramat-
ic reenactments 
— 
which 
are 

mostly 
uncom-

fortable anyway 
— and documen-
tary 
narration 

is 
jarring 
and 

annoying. 
I’d 

rather watch an 
actual documen-
tary or a fiction-
alized T.V. show 

based on historical events.

While the subject matter is 

interesting — and the title of the 
series is perfect — the format 
reminds me of the documen-
tary clips that history teachers 
used in middle school. The six 
wives deserve to have their sto-
ries told with a fresh voice and a 
sharp eye, to escape the largely 
skewed perceptions of them 
that have been handed down 
and embellished through the 
centuries. But this isn’t it.

Walton emerging as MVP for ‘M’

In Michigan’s loss at Illinois a 

few weeks ago, Derrick Walton 
Jr. had a moment atypical 
of someone with his level of 
experience and composure.

After 
picking 
up 
an 

offensive foul, Walton spiked 
the basketball, picked up a 
technical foul and was forced 
to sit the rest of the first half on 
the bench with two fouls.

What transpired afterward 

made the senior guard’s actions 
even more regrettable. The 
Fighting Illini closed the half 
on a 15-2 run, as the Wolverines 
all but collapsed with one of 
their captains sidelined.

The debacle in Champaign 

may come to be the defining 
moment for Walton this season, 
but in a more positive way than 
the initial reaction showed.

Since that Illinois run, Walton 

has come to realize his multi-
faceted value for Michigan.

“I’m just an example guy,” 

Walton said on Thursday. “I go 
out there and show how much 
it means to me. I’m pretty sure 
the guys will huddle around 
me and make sure they help me 
take care of business.”

In the five games that have 

followed the loss to the Fighting 
Illini, Walton has averaged 
18.6 points and 6.2 rebounds 
per game. It’s been one of the 
strongest stretches of games 
he’s played in his Michigan 
career.

And the Wolverines have 

needed 
every 
point, 
every 

board and every assist the 
senior earned.

Walton 
made 
several 

adjustments 
in 
his 
game 

recently that benefit Michigan, 
as the Wolverines have been 
looking for consistency and 
creativity on both ends of the 
court.

Offensively, 
Michigan 

struggled 
to 
attack 
the 

basket off the dribble. The 
Wolverines had been sinking 
into a poor habit of settling for 
low-percentage shots on the 
perimeter, leading to wasted 
offensive possessions.

Walton fell victim to that 

trend — two-thirds of all the 
shots he had taken through the 
contest at Illinois were from 
behind the arc.

In 
Michigan’s 
last 
five 

games, 
though, 
Walton 

attacked the basket more than 
he has all season. His field-goal 
percentage rose three points 
to 41.6 percent, while the 
proportion of three-pointers he 
took per game decreased.

Most 
importantly 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ 
offense, 
Walton 

has been willing to absorb 
contact going to the hoop. He 
set a season high with nine free-
throw attempts in Michigan’s 
win over Nebraska, and topped 
that over the weekend with 15 
attempts, as he tried to carry the 
offense against Michigan State.

Walton 
made 
a 
visible 

effort to look tougher and 
more 
confident 
with 
his 

inside game on offense. While 
the Wolverines needed the 
change to boost their scoring 
efficiency, Walton may have 
needed it more to prove a point.

Since 
Illinois 
center 

Maverick Morgan made his 
“white collar” remarks toward 

Michigan 
following 
the 

Champaign blowout, Walton 
has been on a mission to prove 
how wrong Morgan was.

“As a point guard, I think 

that’s a reflection on me,” 
Walton said on Thursday. “If 
you call a team white collar, 
I think the point guard heads 
the identity of that team. As a 
person who’s never ever been 
questioned 
for 
toughness, 

it made me do a little self-
evaluation.”

That mentality, paired with 

his style of leading by example, 
has changed the way Walton 
and 
the 
Wolverines 
have 

attacked opponents for the 
better.

But defensively, Walton has 

still shown that there’s room 
for improvement over the five-
game stretch.

The 
senior 
struggled 

to 
contain 
his 
defensive 

assignment 
in 
Spartan 

freshman Cassius Winston, and 
didn’t seem to have the mental 
or physical edge that he showed 
in prior wins.

Walton did have to spend 

extra energy on the offensive 
end with senior wing Zak 
Irvin battling the flu. Still, it 
seemed the rest of the team was 
affected when he wasn’t at his 
best.

“I know this team looks at 

me as a leader,” Walton said 
on Sunday. “When I play and I 
show the face that it’s time to 
win, I think they follow suit. 
It’s a two-way street. They give 
me courage and I try to exude it 
by playing hard to start.”

If anything’s been proven 

for Michigan over the past five 
games, it’s that this team will 
only perform up to the level of 
its senior point guard. Walton 
has carried the Wolverines in 
their biggest wins of the season, 
and made costly mistakes at 
their lowest moments.

Gondrezick garners B1G honors

This season, freshman guard 

Kysre 
Gondrezick 
became 
a 

prominent player for the Michigan 
women’s basketball team. But it 
wasn’t until this week that she 
officially cemented herself as an 
elite player in the Big Ten. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

After the Wolverines’ 80-54 

victory over Northwestern last 
Wednesday, 
Gondrezick 
was 

named not only the Big Ten 
Freshman of the Week — an honor 
she had received three times 
previously — but also the Big Ten 
Player of the Week. She is the only 
freshman in the Big Ten to earn 
the Player of the Week award this 
season, let alone sweep the contest.

The last player to sweep the 

conference’s weekly awards was 
Nebraska’s sophomore forward 
Jessica Shepard on Jan. 25, 2016. 
Shepard ended last season as the 
Big Ten Freshman of the Year — an 
award that Gondrezick is putting 
herself in position for. Currently, 

she is the only freshman to win 
multiple Big Ten weekly awards, 
as she has garnered five such nods.

Against 
the 
Wildcats, 

Gondrezick tied her career-high in 
points and rebounds, with 22 and 
seven, respectively. She also went 
6-for-10 from behind the 3-point 
line — another career-best — and 
tallied 6 assists, which marks the 
fifth time this season that she has 
finished with at least five assists.

“I think the ball just went in 

the basket more often than usual,” 
Gondrezick said. “To be able to 
shoot the ball that well gives me 
a lot more confidence moving 
forward. Being able to impact the 
game, whether that was through 
my scoring or rebounding or 
passing, was definitely a humbling 
experience.”

But before she could reel in 

the accolades, it was a long path 
to the starting five. Gondrezick 
came off the bench in 14 games 
before earning a starting position. 
Despite needing to prove herself 
during the first half of the season, 

the rookie has solidified her 
starting role since the start of Big 
Ten play, scoring in double-digits 
in seven of the last eight games.

But breaking into the starting 

rotation wasn’t as smooth as 
Gondrezick made it seem. 

“When I first got here I 

struggled 
tremendously,” 

Gondrezick said. “In the summer 
I cried (on a phone call) home and 
said ‘I don’t think I’m going to 
be nearly half the player I was in 
high school,’ because it truly is a 
different level. … Ultimately, I had 
to make the decision that I was 
either going to do it, or I was going 
to go home. And I did it.”

With 302 points this season, 

Gondrezick 
has 
positioned 

herself as one of the top three 
Wolverine scorers, just 28 points 
behind sophomore forward Hallie 
Thome. Junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty still leads the pack with 
440 points — a difficult statistic to 
top — but Gondrezick continues to 
thrive alongside her.

Flaherty and Thome are the 

only other Michigan players to 
be awarded by the Big Ten this 
season — Flaherty made the 
Honor Roll twice and Thome 
won the Player of the Week 
after her 37-point performance 
against Wisconsin. Gondrezick’s 
breakout performance has given 
the Wolverines more recognition, 
despite still being unranked.

If she can stay consistent, 

Gondrezick will be essential to 
helping Michigan achieve some 
of its postseason goals — namely 
making the NCAA Tournament. 
Even if the Wolverines falter this 
season, Gondrezick will keep 
gaining experience, and will only 
become more fun to watch.

But for now, Gondrezick is 

not focused on gathering more 
personal awards, even though she 
is well-situated to do so.

“I go out there just to have fun,” 

Gondrezick said. “I go out there 
to win. Whether that is scoring 22 
points or scoring two, as long as I 
made my impact and we get the 
best end result possible, then I’m a 
happy camper.”

Wolverines thrive on Senior Night

Before the meet even started, 

Michigan senior Chris Klein 
could 
feel 
the 
adrenaline 

pumping through his veins, 
as he prepared to race in 
Canham Natatorium for the last 
time in his collegiate career. 
An Ann Arbor native, Klein 
looked to cap off his days at 
the natatorium in the same 
dominant fashion that he had 
begun them nearly 10 years ago. 
After touching first in both the 
200-yard breaststroke and 200-
yard IM on Friday, he had done 
just that.

“I’ve been coming to swim 

here and race here for over a 
decade, so it just kind of means 
an era coming to an end for me,” 
Klein said. “In the last time I’m 
ever going to race at Canham, to 
come out on top of a couple of 
races was really special.”

On Friday night, Michigan 

hosted Ohio State in a contest 
that was filled with a double-
whammy of emotions, as it was 
both Senior Night and a rivalry 
matchup. In the end, the ninth-
ranked Wolverines put forth a 
commanding effort to win the 
dual meet over the 17th-ranked 
Buckeyes, 186-114.

“Any time a team at Michigan 

faces Ohio State, the emotions 
rise up,” said Michigan coach 
Mike Bottom.

Added Klein: “It was probably 

the most emotional meet I’ve 
been to in a long time.”

Coming off its first dual meet 

loss since 2010 against No. 4 
Indiana, Michigan was itching 
to get back on track in the pool.

“We were really excited to 

get back to work,” said senior 
Vinny Tafuto.

In the third event of the meet, 

freshman Felix Auböck battled 
Ohio State’s Josh Fleagle in 
the 200-yard freestyle. Going 
into the final turn of the race, 
Auböck and Fleagle were neck 
and neck.

But with a set of powerful 

dolphin kicks underwater, the 
freshman exploded off the wall, 
fending off Fleagle to win the 
event by just 0.01 seconds—the 

narrowest margin possible.

“I knew at 150 yards it was 

going to be super close. He’s a 
strong finisher,” Auböck said. 
“It was super painful … I just 
put 
my 
head 

down and gave 
everything the 
last five to ten 
yards to make 
that touch.”

The 

Wolverines (2-1 
Big 
Ten, 
4-1 

overall) 
won 

11 of 16 events, 
and 
finished 

with the top 
three 
spots 

in the 100-yard breaststroke, 
50-yard 
freestyle, 
200-yard 

breaststroke 
and 
500-yard 

freestyle. Michigan has now 
won 20 dual meets in a row 
against the Buckeyes (2-1, 9-1).

In the 100-yard butterfly, 

Tafuto snuck away with the 
victory, defeating Ohio State’s 
Michael Salazar—the defending 
Big Ten champion—with a time 

of 47.45.

“I had no idea where I was in 

that field,” Tafuto said. “I was 
very fortunate and happy to get 
my hand on the wall.”

For the senior, 

it was a night 
of 
nostalgia 
in 

his 
last 
home 

meet 
for 
the 

Wolverines.

“I 
was 
just 

talking with my 
mom about my 
recruiting trip,” 
Tafuto said. “It’s 
gone 
by 
really 

fast.”

In 
the 
final 

event of the meet, the 400-yard 
freestyle relay, Michigan went 
back and forth with Ohio State. 
When freshman James Jones 
dove into the pool in the second 
leg of the relay, he was behind by 
nearly a body-length. En route 
to posting an incredible 43.41 
split— the fastest out of anyone 
in 
the 
pool—Jones 
passed 

Ohio State’s Andrew Appleby, 

engulfing the natatorium in 
a deafening cheer. But the 
cheers were premature, as the 
Wolverines ended up getting 
disqualified due to an early take 
off in the final exchange.

“That 
was 
a 
little 

disappointing 
to 
us,” 
said 

Bottom. “In a way it was good 
for us, because it shows that we 
can be better and we need to be 
better.”

Just three weeks away from 

the Big Ten Championships, 
Michigan will look to defend its 
title against the Hoosiers, the 
presumed favorite.

“We’re going to battle in 

the Big Ten Championships,” 
Bottom said. “We’re gonna have 
to pull something out.”

With a victory against Ohio 

State, Auböck believes the team 
sent off its eight seniors in the 
most meaningful way it could.

“It was the best thing we 

could give them,” Auböck said. 
“They did so much for us this 
year and we had to give them 
something back.”

Michigan cruises 
against Buckeyes

The No. 7 Michigan women’s 

swimming 
and 
diving 
team 

battled No. 21 Ohio State, as 
the Wolverines honored seven 
of their seniors in Canham 
Natatorium on Senior Night for 
their last meet at home.

Michigan, which has won its 

last 16 dual meets against Big 
Ten teams, won 14 of 16 events 
for a 212-88 victory against the 
Buckeyes, improving its Big Ten 
record to 3-0.

Many 
individuals 
earned 

multiple 
individual 
victories, 

helping Michigan go 1-2-3 in four 
events.

Freshman Kristen Hayden, 

having taken second in the 
one-meter 
and 
three-meter 

springboards in the last meet 
against 
Indiana, 
showed 

improvement in both events. She 
scored 300.9 on the one-meter 
and 323.30 on the three-meter 
springboard, taking first in both 
events.

“I came back and my coach 

and I worked on a lot of basics 
and just getting my entries right, 
just getting my hurdles and my 
take offs and doing more reps,” 
Hayden said. “At Indiana, I didn’t 
do them the way I could, so here, 
I was relaxed and ready to go.”

While 
a 
number 
of 

Wolverines 
improved 
their 

performance 
from 
Indiana, 

many others continued their 
dominant showing from the 
previous 
meet. 
Sophomores 

Siobhán Haughey, Yirong Bi and 
juniors Emily Kopas and Clara 
Smiddy swept their individual 
events.

Haughey — who won three 

individual events in the previous 
dual meet to earn her second 
Big Ten Swimmer of the Week 
honor — repeating her impressive 
feat, placing first in the 10-yard 
freestyle 
(48.39), 
200-yard 

freestyle (1:46:76) and 200-yard 
IM (1:59:32).

Clara Smiddy won her two 

events — 100-yard (54.47) and 
200-yard backstroke (1:56:08) 
— in a similar fashion to her 
performance at Indiana.

Smiddy and Hayden weren’t 

the only ones who improved, 
as Bi broke a pool record in the 
1,000-yard freestyle with a time 
of 9:35:49, shattering an eight 
year record held by Minnesota’s 
Ashley 
Steenvoorden. 
In 

addition, she secured a victory in 
the 500-yard freestyle (4:44:92) 
and contributed in the final 
event, helping her team win the 
400-yard freestyle relay.

Michigan 
not 
only 

overwhelmed Ohio State in terms 
of performances but also with its 
atmosphere for Senior Night.

Kopas believes Senior Night 

against a rival team helped 
keep the spirits high, as each 
individual strived to send the 
seniors off on a high note.

“I think we all went out there 

and did that for the seniors and 
we always strive to beat (Ohio 
State),” Kopas said, “I definitely 
think we have an advantage 
just because we’ve practiced 
(in Canham Natatorium) every 
day and it’s kind of just the 
atmosphere that gets us going.”

Kopas also had an outstanding 

night, winning the 100-yard 
breaststroke (1:02:43) and later 
the 
200-yard 
breaststroke 

(2:12:36), where Bi finished just 
behind her.

Senior Maddy Frost, a Saline, 

Mich. native, had been coming 
to the Canham Natatorium since 
2005 and swam in it for 12 years, 
spanning her time in club and 
college. For her, not being able to 
swim in Canham again seemed 
strange, but she’s excited to see 
where the team is headed in the 
future.

“I swam a season best tonight, 

which was awesome and I think 
that was definitely because of 
the energy of the team and the 
coaches,” Frost said. “Just having 
it be the last time I can compete in 
this pool, so it was just awesome 
to do that and kick their butts.”

‘M’ splits weekend 
tilt at ITA Kick-Off

Traveling to Norman, Okla. 

for the ITA Kick-Off, the No. 19 
Michigan men’s tennis team split 
its weekend series, losing 4-1 to 
No. 16 Oklahoma on Saturday, 
but defeating No. 25 Arkansas on 
Sunday, 4-0.

Saturday’s match was marked 

with a flurry of Oklahoma 
victories, as the Sooners opened 
up a decisive 3-0 lead, with wins 
in No. 1 singles, No. 3 singles, No. 
1 doubles and No. 3 doubles.

Sophomore 
Myles 
Schalet 

closed the gap to 3-1 after a win 
in the No. 5 singles match, before 
the Wolverines began to mount a 
comeback behind senior Jathan 
Malik and juniors Runhao Hua 
and Davis Crocker. Each forced 
a third set with second-set 
tiebreakers in the No. 2, 4 and 
6 singles matches. Malik forced 
a tiebreaker once again in the 
third set, but lost 7-6, giving 
Oklahoma the game-clinching 
fourth tally.

“We just need to play as a team 

from the beginning all the way 
through the match. We didn’t do 
that,” said Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg. 
“We 
really 
came 

together a little bit too late. We 
needed to establish that energy 
and enthusiasm and our fight as 
a team way earlier, and it caught 
up to us.”

Sunday proved to be a much 

different story. The Wolverines 
got off to quick start and rode 
their momentum to a decisive 
4-0 shutout victory over the 

Razorbacks. Leading the way 
was freshman Connor Johnston, 
who was inserted in the No. 1 
doubles lineup along with Malik 
in his very first collegiate match. 
The duo won their match to the 
tune of a 6-1 score, and Johnston 
gave Michigan its fourth and 
final point with a win in the No. 
6 singles match.

“He was a spark plug for us,” 

Steinberg said. “He came in and 
he was a big lift in doubles. To 
throw him in at No. 1 doubles, 
where he hasn’t ever played 
college tennis before and to win 
6-1 — him and Jathan — was 
incredible. I can’t say enough 
about his performance (Sunday) 
and what he brought to our team 
and we need that.”

Adding to the Wolverines’ 

score were Crocker and junior 
Alex Knight, who won the No. 
5 and No. 4 singles matches, 
respectively. Knight and Hua 
were also able to come away with 
a victory in the No. 2 doubles 
matchup.

With 
a 
match 
against 

Princeton on Thursday, the team 
will look to carry on the same 
energy and enthusiasm that they 
captured against Arkansas on 
Sunday, but had lacked the day 
before.

“We did a great job fighting 

back against Oklahoma. I thought 
the guys really competed hard, 
but they need to compete for 
each other for longer stretches 
of time,” Steinberg said. “If we 
do that like we did today (against 
Arkansas), we’re pretty tough to 
beat.”

Slaker carving out role with Wolverines

In his second and final season 

with the Bloomington Thunder 
of the United States Hockey 
League, Jake Slaker served as 
the team captain. While some 
team leaders choose to assert 
their authority vocally, Slaker 
instead led by example.

Now, with the Michigan 

hockey team, the freshman 
forward is far from the team’s 
most 
prominent 
leader 
in 

the locker room. Still, his 
position on the team calls for 
responsibility.

“When 
you’re 
a 
top-six 

forward, you’re a leader on this 
team no matter 
what class you’re 
in,” said senior 
forward 
Alex 

Kile. 
“(Slaker) 

kills 
penalties, 

plays 
on 
the 

power play and 
he’s 
important 

for 
us 
in 
all 

aspects of the 
game. Whenever 
you have a player 
who can contribute in all three 
areas of the rink, you’re gonna 
be a leader no matter what.”

It’s high praise coming from 

Kile, one of the two Wolverine 
captains. Through the first 22 
games of the season, Slaker’s 
play 
has 
justified 
Kile’s 

comments — he ranks first in 
points and assists for Michigan 
with 14 and 10, respectively.

But it didn’t always appear 

that easy for Slaker. In his first 
few games, he acknowledged 
the difficulty that comes with 
the transition from the slower-
paced USHL to the quicker 
gameplay at the NCAA level.

While at times — much 

like Michigan’s entire lineup 
— 
Slaker 
appears 
to 
lose 

concentration or struggle on 
special teams, Kile recognizes 
the strides his teammate has 
made since the first game.

“He’s not a player who really 

talks about offense or talks 
about 
scoring 
goals,” 
Kile 

said. “He wants to get better 
defensively, and I think he’s 
struggled a little bit if you’re 
looking 
at 
plus-minus, 
but 

he’s a player that wants to get 
better. He wants to be that shut-
down centerman that (former 
Michigan forward) JT Compher 
was 
and 
(former 
Michigan 

forward) Andrew Copp was. 

He aspires to be 
them and he has 
told me that he 
wants to be like 
that.”

Because 
of 

the Wolverines’ 
inconsistent 
play this season, 
Slaker 
has 

seen 
different 

linemates every 
few games. In 

the early part of the season, 
he played in the first grouping 
with Kile and fellow-freshman 
forward Will Lockwood, but has 
also played on the second and 
third lines. Slaker’s flexibility 
earned a commendation from 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
Berenson 
explained 
that 

injuries and suspensions to 
Slaker’s linemates causes him 
to reshuffle the lines every so 
often.

“Jake 
is 
a 
competitor,” 

Berenson said. “He comes to 
play, most every game you’re 
going to get everything he’s got. 
Now there’s been the odd game 

when he wasn’t as invested in 
the game, or lost his focus or we 
needed a centerman on another 
line. … But it didn’t change his 
ice time.

“The thing I like about him 

is that he brings a line together. 
Whoever he plays with, he’ll 
try to get that line organized 
and play the right way and play 
together. He’s an organizer 
even though he’s a freshman.”

According to Kile, Slaker’s 

best assets include his energy, 
his 
confidence 
and 
his 

constant desire to learn from 
veteran 
players. 
Slaker, 
for 

one, believes he has improved 
his decision making. As the 
season continues, Slaker is still 
working 
with 

the Wolverines’ 
coaching 
staff 

to improve some 
of the intangible 
aspects of his 
game 
that 

are not easily 
recognized.

“I 
want 
to 

improve 
my 

physicality with 
the puck,” Slaker 
said. “To try not to get knocked 
off with the puck as much, win 
my one-on-one battles. I don’t 
think people notice that all 
the time, it’s sometimes just a 
stick play or me getting better 
positioning with the puck. My 
goal is to get a little stronger 
with and without the puck.”

Perhaps the most important 

facet 
of 
Slaker’s 
game 
— 

especially as a center — is his 
success on faceoffs. Currently, 
Slaker leads Michigan in faceoff 
victories with 201 and ranks 
third in winning percentage — 
boasting a .510 mark. Berenson 
constantly 
discusses 
the 

importance of winning faceoffs 
and maintaining possession of 
the puck afterward with his 
team. It’s an area the Wolverines 
have struggled with, posting 
just a .483 winning percentage.

As one of the few Michigan 

players that has found success in 
that aspect of the game, Slaker 
has a unique approach to faceoffs.

“My main job is not to lose 

(the puck),” Slaker said. “To get 
a 50-50 battle between myself 
and the wingers where we can 
battle out and try to get the 
win. Overall my mindset going 
into faceoffs is try not to lose it 
clean.”

Currently, Slaker practices 

on a line with Lockwood and 

sophomore 
forward 
Brendan 
Warren, 
and 

whether 
that 

holds 
for 
the 

rest 
of 
the 

season is up to 
Berenson. What 
can be said for 
sure, though, is 
that Slaker will 
show a positive 

attitude and desire to adapt 
with his teammates.

And while he clearly no 

longer commandeers the locker 
room as he once did for the 
Thunder, it’s obvious Slaker 
still plays a vital role in the 
Wolverines’ success.

“He communicates well with 

his teammates and linemates,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“He 
knows 

how to play with a sense of 
responsibility for our team in 
key situations, whether it’s a big 
faceoff, or a second effort play. 
He wants to be that guy that 
will do that because he’s done 
that before.”
