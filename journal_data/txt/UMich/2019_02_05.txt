After free-speech watchdog 
group 
Speech 
First 
filed 
a 
lawsuitagainst the University of 
Michigan last May, the University 
has restricted the housing staff, 
such as resident advisors and 
diversity peer educators, from 
removing speech from student 
doors — including hate speech.
The lawsuit was filed against 
the University’s Bias Response 
Team and accused the school 
of limiting students’ abilities 
to express themselves freely. 
Since 
then, 
the 
University 
has 
attempted 
to 
show 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
First 
Amendment by allowing more 
student 
expression. 
In 
the 
dormitories, 
this 
means 
no 
writings or postings can be 
removed from a student’s door 

without the student’s permission.
One RA, who has chosen 
to remain anonymous due to 
legal 
concerns, 
believes 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
policy 
restricting how racist speech is 
handled could be problematic. 
They think the policy will 
negatively affect the students it 
targets.
“I most definitely think it 
can have an emotional impact,” 
they said. “If you wake up in the 
morning and you open your door 
and see something [offensive], it 
can make you feel like you don’t 
belong, it can make you feel like 
you’re not a valued member of the 
community and that you’re out of 
place.”
The RA also brought up 
past incidents involving racist 
messages 
on 
student 
doors. 
Last year there was an incident 
in West Quad involving three 

Black students’ whose doors 
were 
vandalized 
with 
hate 
speech, including the N-word. 
The RA emphasized how having 
to be in an environment where 
derogatory speech is present 
can have an impact on students’ 
wellbeing.
“Even last year’s event of the 
n-word being on the door... ” 
they said. “I knew some of those 
people [who saw were affected 
by it] and it most definitely has an 
impact on you and other people 
who have those same identities or 
simply empathize with you. It can 
have an emotional toll because 
as a human being, sometimes 
you say, ‘This is wrong,’ but it 
gets a lot into what is right and 
wrong and who constitutes that, 
so I do think it can be difficult 
to maneuver and that’s where 
morality and University policies 
have trouble interplaying.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Ruchi 
Wankhede also reflected on the 
incident in West Quad Residence 
Hall when considering the policy. 
As someone who has lived in 
West Quad for the last two years, 
she recalled how upsetting the 
situation was. She said she’s 
wary of RAs and DPEs losing 
their ability to remove oppressive 
speech.
“Last year, I was in West Quad 
when the whole incident with 
racist slurs on doors happened,” 
Wankhede said. “Those are my 
hallmates. It was so jarring for 
everyone involved, everyone in 
the community. The fact that the 
free speech is there, the fact that 
the University didn’t help out 
that much with the investigation 
is very upsetting. We still don’t 
even know who did it to this day.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Less than a year after the 
Trump 
administration 
and 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency 
received 
backlash 
for attempting to block the 
publication of a federal study 
that concluded PFAS chemicals 
at low concentrations were 
dangerous, it is expected the 
Trump administration will not 
set a limit for PFAS chemicals in 
drinking water.
According to the city of Ann 
Arbor’s site, samples collected 
from the city’s drinking water 

in the fall of 2018 revealed a 
rise in PFAS levels since 2016. 
Since the reported increase, Ann 
Arbor has been committed to 
monitoring PFAS levels. In late 
2018, City Council approved a 
proposal to replace all of the 
city’s old carbon filters with new 
filters.
PFAS chemicals have been 
used for several decades in 
industrial 
and 
consumer 
products such as cookware 
and 
fire-retardant 
materials. 
Some scientific studies have 
shown PFAS chemicals can have 
significant health consequences 
such as learning and growth 

impairments 
in 
children, 
weakened immune systems, and 
increased risk of cancer. The 
EPA’s decision against a PFAS 
limit in drinking water would 
mean PFAS chemicals would 
remain largely unregulated.
In response to news of the 
EPA’s impending decision to 
continue to allow PFAS levels 
to be unregulated, 20 U.S. 
senators, 
including 
Debbie 
Stabenow, D-Mich., and Gary 
Peters, 
D-Mich., 
penned 
a 
letter this week to acting EPA 
Administrator Andrew Wheeler 
to urge the EPA to set a limit for 
PFAS.

Devin Pascoe, a sophomore 
environmental 
engineering 
major, expressed her displeasure 
with the government’s lack of 
response to the health risks 
associated with PFAS. She said 
she believes the government 
could do more to address the 
health risks.
“It seems like the government 
is not addressing the issue in 
the manner that they should, 
especially 
since 
they 
were 
making citizens pay for testing 
their water themselves,” Pascoe 
said.

On Monday night, Ann Arbor 
City Council passed resolutions 
to 
encourage 
members 
of 
the 
community 
to 
support 
the boycott of Wendy’s, to 
strengthen nuclear emergency 
planning and to support a 
strong Clean Air Act and strong 
Clean Water Rule.
At City Hall, before the city 
council meeting began, the 
A2 Safe Transport, a citizens 
advocacy group working to 
ensure 
pedestrian 
safety, 
rallied for their cause. They 
are attempting to implement 
Vision Zero, a multidisciplinary 
approach to address local traffic 
technologies and policies.
LSA junior Cindy Lin, intern 
for 
Councilmember 
Kathy 
Griswold, D-Ward 2, is on the 
A2 Safe Transport committee. 
She discussed how the New 
York-based organization can 
bring its initiatives to Ann 
Arbor.

The Ford School of Public 
Policy hosted a talk Monday to 
debate different frames of mind 
surrounding gun control and 
its effectiveness. Each panelist 
discussed opposing perspectives 
on firearm policy as well as the 
pros and cons of looking at the 
issue in terms of injury prevention, 
mental health, education, politics 
and journalism.
Michael Barr, dean of the Public 
Policy School, began the event by 
highlighting the frequency of 
mass shootings in the news cycle.
Panelist Rebecca Cunningham, 
professor of emergency medicine, 
said she views gun policy from a 
public health perspective – the 
same way she would look at any 
other harmful situation.
“Firearms 
are 
not 
really 
different than any other injury 
prevention framework, not to be 
thought of any differently from 
a vehicle crash to a fire and 
burn,” Cunningham said.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
implemented 
a 
new 
policy 
Monday 
requiring members of the 
community to disclose all 
charges and convictions of 
felonies within a week of the 
charge or conviction. The 
policy applies to all faculty 
and staff, including student 
employees, volunteers and 
visiting scholars.
According to the policy, 
those who do not disclose 
felonies will face serious 
consequences and potential 
dismissal.
After the felony charge 
or conviction has been self-
reported, 
the 
University 
Human 
Resources 
department 
will 
assess 
the incident based on the 
gravity of the offense, the 
timeliness 
and 
accuracy 
of the disclosure and the 
relevancy to the role held at 
the University.
The reporting of a felony 
does not necessarily mean 
the 
individual 
will 
face 
disciplinary action.
Laurita Thomas, associate 
vice president for Human 
Resources, 
said 
the 
University implemented the 
new policy to ensure the 

campus is as safe as possible.
“We 
became 
aware 
of 
circumstances 
where 
we 
were 
not 
aware 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
situation 
across 
higher ed, not necessarily 
at Michigan,” Thomas said. 
“And many institutions have 
moved to enhance the safety 
of our community and this 
knowledge will help us do 
that.”
When 
asked 
about 
how 
Human 
Resources 
will 
determine 
what 
consequences, 
if 
any, 
are 
deemed 
appropriate, 
Thomas said they will use 
similar standards to the 
criminal history questions 
and background checks all 
applicants are required to go 
through before employment.
“We 
indicated 
in 
the 
announcement 
we 
would 
use criteria similar to our 
background check policy,” 
Thomas said.
According to the U-M 
Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization, 
the 
new 
policy applies to residential 
advisers but does not apply to 
graduate student instructors 
or other graduate students 
covered by the collective 
bargaining unit.

On Monday, University of 
Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 
the 
creation of the President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality. It will provide 
recommendations 
and 
strategies 
on 
achieving 
carbon 
neutrality 
and 
work 
with 
members 
of 
all three campuses. The 
group 
is 
composed 
of 
faculty, 
students 
and 
administrators, as well as 
local partnerships.
According 
to 
the 
mission 
statement, 
the 
commission’s 
objectives 
are 
to 
interpret 
the 
University’s 
parameters 
regarding 
carbon 
neutrality 
and 
create 
a 
timeline 
for 
reaching 

the 
environmentally 
sustainable 
and 
community-inclusive goal. 
Avenues 
the 
initiative 
will cover include energy 
sourcing, policy change and 
technology 
development, 
among other topics.
The 
co-chairs 
of 
the 
commission are Jennifer 
Haverkamp, 
director 
of 
the Graham Sustainability 
Institute, 
and 
Stephen 
Forrest, 
professor 
of 
electrical engineering and 
computer 
science. 
There 
are 
also 
two 
spots 
for 
students, which yet to be 
filled.
The 
Climate 
Action 
Movement, 
a 
group 
composed 
of 
students, 
alumni, 
faculty 
and 
residents, has been active 
on campus in pressing the 
importance 
of 
achieving 

carbon 
neutrality. 
Engineering junior Logan 
Vear, 
president 
of 
the 
Climate Action Movement, 
 
said 
while 
the 
group 

is 
glad 
the 
University 
is 
attempting 
to 
reach 
sustainability, 
they 
are 
concerned the commission 
is too similar to past 
efforts, which failed.
“We’re happy U of M 
is starting the process 
to catch up to our peers 
on climate action,” Vear 
said. “However, we’re 
disappointed that there 
is little indication that 
this won’t just be a 
repeat of the President’s 
failed Greenhouse Gas 
Reduction 
Committee 
four 
years 
ago, 
particularly given some 
of the new commission 
members were on this 
past committee.”
Additionally, 
Vear 
pointed out how some 
of the members of the 
commission 
may 
have 
conflicting interests.
“It 
is 
also 
highly 
disappointing that DTE 
and Consumers Energy 
were 
given 
spots 
on 
the 
commission 
itself 
instead 
of 
potentially 
in an advisory panel, 
given their history of 

fighting 
against 
climate 
policy, their advocating for 
natural gas expansion and 
particularly 
their 
direct 
conflict of interest being 
financially dependent upon 
U of M,” Vear said.
Four 
advisory 
panels 
will 
be 
implemented 
through the commission. 
They include the Student 
Advisory 
Panel, 
Faculty 
Expert Panel, University 
Advisory Panel and the 
External Advisory Panel.
The 
Student 
Advisory 
Panel will act as a platform 
for 
students 
to 
present 
ideas 
and 
engage 
with 
the 
commission. 
Faculty 
members and other experts 
will be selected to form the 
Faculty Expert Advisory 
panel 
to 
advise 
the 
commission on solutions for 
carbon neutrality. A third 
panel including members of 
U-M Flint, U-M Dearborn 
and 
other 
University 
units will make up the 
University Advisory Panel, 
and the External Advisory 
Panel will be comprised 
of knowledgeable sources 
outside of the University.
Schlissel 
told 
The 
Daily in an interview in 
January he believes carbon 
emissions are a profound 
societal 
problem 
and 
the University is in good 
standing to find a solution.
“I’m confident we can get 
to our 25-percent decrease 
in greenhouse gas emission 
goal even early, but that’s 
not enough, and we literally 
do have to figure out how to 
approach 100 percent, how 
to approach a sustainable 
level of carbon cycling in 
the environment,” Schlissel 
said.

Despite the reluctance to 
establish PFAS limits, a draft 
of the EPA chemical plan 
states PFAS will be listed as a 
hazardous substance, a move 
that will make it easier to hold 
companies 
accountable 
for 
their waste. In January, U.S. 
Reps. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann 
Arbor, Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, 
and Dan Kildee, D-Oscoda, 
introduced legislation to declare 
PFAS chemicals as hazardous. 
By listing PFAS as a hazardous 
chemical, the PFAS Action Act 
would allow the EPA to devote 
federal resources to clean up 
water in contaminated areas.
Dingell stated in a press 
release that PFAS are a threat to 
Michigan residents, and it was 
her desire by introducing the 
PFAS Action Act to urge the EPA 
to clean up Michigan’s drinking 
water.
“Michigan has been hit hard 
by PFAS,” Dingell said. “It’s clear 

it’s a threat to human health and 
our environment. It’s been found 
in our drinking water, air, food, 
and consumer products.”
Ann Arbor water treatment 
manager Brian Steglitz said 
he was confident Ann Arbor 
could easily meet new EPA 
standards if PFAS were listed 
as hazardous. Many states have 
acted independently to set limits 
on PFAS and Steglitz said Ann 
Arbor is currently planning 
to meet some of the strictest 
standards set by other states.
“The 
position 
in 
Ann 
Arbor we’re taking so far is 
attempting to meet the most 
stringent 
requirements 
that 
currently exist around the U.S. 
on regulating PFAS because 
many states have already taken 
that initiative,” Steglitz said. 
“So I think we would be well-
positioned to meet any standards 
if they were legislated at the 
national or even state level.”
Steglitz said Ann Arbor’s 
current goal is to have levels of 
PFAS below 10 parts per trillion. 
According 
to 
Steglitz, 
Ann 

Arbor is on its way to meeting 
that goal, and because no states 
currently have any PFAS limits 
at that level, he believes Ann 
Arbor would have no issue with 
meeting any potential national 
limits.
“This 
is 
an 
emerging 
contaminant, so I feel very good 
about the work we have done 
to stay ahead of the regulatory 
curve,” Steglitz said. “But there’s 
a lot of research going on. Based 
on the information we know, 
we’re in a very good place.”
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
issued 
an executive order Monday to 
establish the Michigan PFAS 
Action Response Team as a 
permanent 
organization 
to 
continue to identify sources of 
PFAS and protect Michigan’s 
water. Created as a temporary 
team in 2017, MPART has 
already 
identified 
numerous 
contaminated sites in Michigan.
Councilmember 
Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1, said he was 
thrilled to see many Michigan 
officials respond to the threat 
of PFAS, despite the national 

administration’s reluctance. He 
explained Ann Arbor continues 
to monitor its water and to 
work with county and state 
officials to provide clean water 
for residents, but said more 
legislation will need to be passed 
to hold companies accountable.
“If you want the polluter to 
pay (to do the clean-up) then 
these standards are set, but if 
these standards are set real high, 
then they don’t have to do any 
clean-up,” Hayner said. “The bar 
is set very low for clean-up.”
Hayner believes more local 
control is needed to help protect 
environmental resources. He 
hopes legislation can change at 
either the state or federal level 
so cities can have more of a say 
in environmental issues.
“One of our big policy goals 
is to continue to work with 
our state representatives and 
our federal representatives to 
change these laws to allow local 
control 
over 
environmental 

Amir 
Baghdadchi, 
senior 
associate 
director 
of 
University 
Housing, 
explained the intricacies of 
dealing with housing spaces. 
While the policy does not 
extend to community areas, 
such as housing notice boards, 
student doors are deemed 
personal 
spaces, 
and 
the 
individuals whom they belong 
to have the right to express 
themselves in almost any way 
they please.
“Housing spaces are unique 
for a couple of reasons,” 
Baghdadchi said. “One is that 
they actually are a balance 
between 
being 
community 
spaces — places that we all 
share and we want those to be 
inclusive. At the same time, 
individual rooms — those are 
personal spaces. Of course, 
the building has to balance 
both of those, and that means 
in every housing building 
you’ve 
got 
at 
least 
two 
different kinds of spaces.”
He further emphasized the 
University’s dedication to the 
First Amendment, and noted 
how even if some individuals 
find speech on a student’s 
door upsetting, the student 
still has a right to express 
themselves.
“It’s 
the 
University’s 
commitment as a whole to 
be very clear about how we 
do not suppress speech, even 

when it is an opinion we 
find detestable,” Baghdadchi 
said. “We don’t censor that 
speech.”
Though not all speech can 
be removed, there is a process 
in place for RAs and DPEs to 
follow if racist statements 
are present on an individual’s 
door. Baghdadchi said the 
first response to potentially 
harmful speech is reporting 
it to a professional staff 
member who then takes the 
information to the Housing 
Diversity and Inclusion unit, 
which directs the incident to 
the Division of Public Safety 
and Security, the hall director 
or another University official. 
There are also conversations 
held with the student who 
was the source of the speech 
as well as with those who 
are impacted by the speech. 
Additionally, if any speech 
threatens 
violence 
against 
another individual or group, 
the threat is handled by DPSS.
Along with filing reports, 
Baghdadchi explained how 
RAs can use their connection 
to hall residents to help 
guide them through difficult 
situations. 
“Now on the other hand, 
one of the most important 
things RAs can do is support 
their residents,” Baghdadchi 
said. 
The RA also explained how 
they would go about handling 
a situation involving a racist 
or derogatory comment on 
a door, and emphasized the 

importance 
of 
taking 
the 
impacted student’s lead as to 
how to resolve the issue.
“One thing I’ve been a 
big proponent of is treating 
people how they want to be 
treated,” they said. “Let’s say 
someone who was impacted 
by this situation, I may want 
to take this action, but first 
you need to talk to them and 
see what they want to do 
and see how they feel. It’s 
important to take care of 
them first, whether that be a 
conversation or connecting 
them with other resources 
because as RAs, you can’t do 
everything.”
While the RA has a plan 
for responding to a situation 
where 
a 
resident 
posts 
an 
offensive 
comment 
on 
their door in a manner that 
coincides with the policy, 
they also admitted it would 
be difficult to watch their 
residents go through these 
types of situations.
“I think it’s hard,” they 
said. “I see something and 
say, ‘That’s obviously not 
right,’ or, ‘That’s obviously 
going to have some sort of 
implication on the resident.’ 
I don’t want them to see 
that. It’s not like I walk 
around like, ‘That’s not my 
problem, that’s on you.’ I feel 
bad, too, but understanding 
on several ends of things 
people have reasons for why 
they do things and there are 
other mechanisms to create 
understanding.”

Baghdadchi acknowledged 
how even though immediately 
removing 
harmful 
speech 
may seem like the right 
way to handle a situation, 
it is not always the most 
permanent 
solution. 
He 
explained 
while 
the 
University is demonstrating 
its 
commitment 
to 
free 
speech, he also believes they 
are 
demonstrating 
their 
commitment 
to 
students 
impacted 
by 
racial 
slurs 
through 
providing 
the 
appropriate responses.
“The 
responsibility 
(to 
impacted 
students) 
lies 
in responding in a timely, 
effective way to that student, 
giving that student support, 
making it clear that the 
message they see, that they 
may find harmful to them, 
does 
not 
represent 
the 
University’s point of view,” 
Baghdadchi said. “... Taking it 
upon ourselves to do a follow-
up with the source of that 
speech.”
Moving forward, the RA 
explained how even though 
the inability to immediately 
remove racist speech may 
make some residents feel like 
nothing is being done, the 
housing staff is working to 
make sure the right reports 
are being filed so the right 
steps can be taken to handle 
the situation.

“If we look at the death 
rates over the past 10 or 15 
years, we see that firearms 
are the second leading cause 
of death among children and 
teens in our country … we’re 
not allowing the children 
in our country to become 
18-year-olds.”
Cunningham 
claimed 
guns are never going away 
and it is important to work 
together 
on 
preventing 
future deaths and injuries 
from firearms.
“Guns are going to exist 
in our culture, cars are going 
to exist in our culture,” 
Cunningham said. “And now, 
together, we have to work 
towards how those things 
are going to be more safe and 
how we’re going to have less 
children dead.”
The 
conversation 
transitioned to discussing 
the 
importance 
of 
understanding 
other 
people’s experiences with 
guns.
Panelist 
Jane 
Coaston, 
senior politics reporter at 
Vox, said people often lack 
an accurate understanding 
of how others think about 
firearms — even between 
different pro-gun groups.
“When you talk to some 
folks in the conservative 
movement, how they think 
about guns is very different 
from how they think people 
that own guns in other 
communities 
think 
about 
guns,” Coaston said. “So 
their guns are very much 
their means of self-defense, 
whereas 
they’re 
(other 
communities) 
using 
guns 
to be terrible and shoot 
everyone. Whereas if you 
go and talk to people who 
are living in Baltimore or 
elsewhere, they’re interested 
in owning guns for the same 
reason as people in Iowa. In 
the interest in self-defense 
or because they want to go to 
a gun range at some point.”
Coaston continued and 
claimed showing different 
communities 
their 
gun 
usage and beliefs are not 
as different as they think is 
crucial to altering policy.
“We need to make sure 
communities 
understand 
they’re not as dissimilar 
as they think when we’re 
talking 
about 
these 
particular issues,” Coaston 
said.
Coaston then discussed 
how one’s views on firearms 
may appear to be an accurate 
depiction of one’s political 
beliefs as a whole, but she 
claimed the two can be 

entirely separate.
“Polarization 
and 
how 
guns have become a slang 
way of getting to know 
someone’s 
politics 
when 
it really shouldn’t be, is 
something 
that’s 
been 
a 
really big hindrance to this 
conversation,” Coaston said.
Cunningham 
said 
the 
main focus of firearm policy 
going forward should be a 
deeper 
understanding 
of 
gun accessibility and why 
families feel the need to own 
guns.
“Whose 
responsibility 
is it in our society to have a 
4-year-old not have access to 
a loaded gun?” Cunningham 
said. “And why is this young 
family with a 4-year-old and 
a pregnant mother feel they 
need to sleep with a loaded 
gun under their bed?”
The 
panelists 
then 
discussed 
how 
some 
of 
the 
current 
perspectives 
surrounding gun policy are 
not effective.
Panelist Jonathan Metzl, 
professor 
of 
psychiatry 
and sociology at Vanderbilt 
University, 
discussed 
barriers between activists, 
academics and politicians.
“I do feel that part of the 
issues that are happening 
are tied to the relationship 
between the activism realm 
and the legal realm,” Metzl 
said. “The legal realm is 
really where those everyday 
practices are being shaped.”
Coaston 
ended 
the 
discussion by adding that 
gun safety is only mentioned 
after a mass shooting, but 
it should be talked more 
frequently if real change is 
going to happen.
“We start talking about 
gun policy when something 
terrible 
has 
happened, 
specifically a mass shooting, 
and 
we 
saw 
that 
after 
Parkland and we see it after 
pretty much every well-
known 
mass 
shooting,” 
Coaston said. “That is the 
time to have a conversation 
about gun policy when we 
should be talking about gun 
policy at all times.”
Public 
Health 
student 
Jane Smith said a priority in 
gun safety should be really 
trying to understand why 
people 
and 
communities 
own guns in order to figure 
out the next step.
“I think really getting at 
the root of gun ownership 
and why are people owning 
guns, and understanding the 
cultural aspect behind, it can 
help us in identifying where 
to go next,” Smith said.

“We want to let our 
bargaining unit members 
know that this does not 
apply to employees who 
are ‘covered by the terms 
of a collective bargaining 
unit,’ which includes GSIs 
and GSSAs under the GEO 
contract,” the statement 
read. “However, if you 
hold an RA position in 
addition to a GSI or GSSA 
appointment, this new 
policy does apply to you.”
Some 
faculty 
have 
expressed concern about 
the new policy.
The 
Daily 
obtained 
an email sent by Rowell 
Huesmann, 
professor 
of 
communication 
studies and psychology, 
to the Senate Advisory 
Committee on University 
Affairs. 
Huesmann 
claimed 
the 
policy 
disregards the rights of 
all faculty and staff to 
due process by requiring 
disclosure of charges and 
not just convictions.
“To me, it seems like an 
outrageous violation of 
faculty, staff, and student 
rights,” Huesmann wrote. 
“The 
policy 
not 
only 
requires one to report 

‘convictions,’ 
(which 
would be bad enough), 
but it also requires one 
to report simply ‘being 
charged’ with a felony 
which often involves no 
‘due process.’”
In response to these 
concerns, Thomas stated 
the University upholds 
legal 
procedures 
and 
respects the rights of all 
community members.
“The 
due 
process 
continues,” Thomas said. 
“If we make a decision 
that the individual wants 
to appeal, the normal 
appeal 
processes 
at 
the University will be 
available.”
Thomas 
said 
the 
University 
is 
not 
stripping 
faculty 
of 
due 
process, 
and 
the 
wellbeing of the campus 
is most important.
“Felony 
charges 
are 
very serious; it means 
that they wwhave found 
enough evidence to do 
the charge, and so we will 
review charges in order 
to ensure the safety of 
our community,” Thomas 
said.

“One of the initiatives we 
are working on is based on 
Vision Zero, which is really 
successful,” Lin said. “I live 
in New York City and that’s 
where it’s based, so it’s 
interesting to see how New 
York is really successful in 
this and Ann Arbor is not. 
I’m trying to work with 
the CSG assembly to work 
on a resolution to get the 
school to support issues 
that Kathy Griswold has 
for pedestrian safety.”
At 
the 
meeting, 
the 
Resolution to Encourage 
Transportation 
Collaboration 
initiative 
passed, allowing the city 
of Ann Arbor to work 
closely with members of 
the University of Michigan 
and 
other 
appropriate 
collaborators 
to 
create 
innovative 
solutions 
for 
the urban transportation 
landscape of Ann Arbor. 
Griswold 
sponsored 
the 
resolution.
Following the discussion 
of 
transportation, 
the 
Resolution to Encourage 
Ann 
Arbor 
Community 
Members to Support Farm 
Workers 
Rights 
and 
to 
Boycott Wendy’s and Other 

Food 
Service 
Providers 
not 
Supportive 
of 
the 
Fair Food Program was 
passed. 
This 
resolution, 
which 
advocates 
the 
boycott of the fast-food 
chain 
because 
of 
labor 
concerns, was sponsored 
by 
Councilmembers 
Elizabeth Nelson, D-Ward 
4, Jack Eaton, D-Ward 4, 
and Griswold.
Kimberly 
Daley, 
a 
postdoctoral 
fellow 
in 
Public Health, spoke during 
the 
public 
commentary 
section of City Council. She 
works to spread awareness 
about labor justice in the 
food system and explained 
the history of the Wendy’s 
boycott to the council.
“The Fair Food Program 
(has signed) with 14 multi-
billion-dollar corporations, 
which 
has 
virtually 
eliminated exploitation for 
hundreds of thousands of 
farm workers,” Daley said. 
“Of these 14 corporations, 
McDonalds, 
Subway, 
Chipotle, Taco Bell, Burger 
King and Walmart have all 
signed on. Wendy’s refuses, 
which is why workers have 
asked consumers across the 
country to boycott them.”
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, I-Ward-2, did vote 
to pass the resolution but 
expressed some hesitations 
with the political message 

that this boycott would 
give.
“For me, resolutions like 
this, there needs to be a 
direct local connection,” 
Lumm said. “Otherwise it 
becomes a more political 
message 
or 
statement- 
with all due respect to 
the cosponsors. But I just 
think in the future I’d 
like to focus on making 
positions and statements 
like this that have a direct 
local connection.”
Next, 
the 
council 
passed 
the 
Resolution 
to 
Strengthen 
Nuclear 
Emergency Planning for 
the Population of the City 
of Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
This 
resolution 
would 
support the stockpiling of 
nonprescription potassium 
iodine 
in 
communities 
located within 50 miles 
of an actively operating 
nuclear power plant, for 
the preservation of public 
safety. In the instance of 
a nuclear accident, Ann 
Arbor residents would be 
encouraged to take the 
nonprescription potassium 
iodide (KI) pills in order to 
prevent thyroid cancer. 
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
David 
Schonberger 
spoke during the public 
comments 
and 
highly 
recommended 
preparing 
for a nuclear emergency 

for 
health 
reasons 
and 
financial reasons.
“Even if public health 
officials do not recommend 
it, the demand for KI will 
be high following a nuclear 
emergency,” 
Schonberger 
said. “The KIU should be 
a part of an emergency 
plan including evacuation, 
sheltering, and avoidance 
of contaminated food in 
the event of a nuclear 
emergency.”
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 
D-Ward-5, 
approved of the spending, 
and 
brought 
forward 
President 
Trump’s 
withdrawal from nuclear 
treaties as reasoning for 
supporting the policy. 
“I 
think 
this 
is 
a 
very 
forward 
thinking 
resolution that is being 
brought 
forward 
and 
appreciate 
the 
efforts 
to bring it to council,” 
Ramlawi said. “We have 
a 
president 
right 
now 
that is withdrawing from 
the nuclear treaties with 
Russia. We’re entering a 
new arms race possibly 
with nuclear weapons, so 
for the cost of less than a 
dollar per person this is a 
sound investment.”

D

espite 
attempts 
to 

remain out of the 
public spotlight and 

dodge 
partisan 

judgment 
best 

reserved for elected 
officials, the U.S. 
Supreme Court has 
cultivated 
quite 

a prominent (and 
romantic) 
image 

in 
the 
American 

imagination. 
Perhaps 
it 
is 

because 
of 
the 

countless 
TV 

shows and classic films such 
as “My Cousin Vinny,” in 
which the law is a backdrop 
for drama and the judge’s 
gavel 
an 
instrument 
of 

climax. Or perhaps we owe it 
to emotive portrayals of the 
high court as a force for good, 
as “The People vs. Larry 
Flynt” evokes. For whatever 
reason, the allure of a body 
so apolitical and professional 
in its composition, yet so 
absolute in its authority, has 
become inescapable.

The 
latest 
Second 

Amendment case to land on 
the Supreme Court’s docket, 
New York State Rifle and 
Pistol Association v. City 
of New York, exemplifies 
this phenomenon. The New 
York State Rifle and Pistol 
Association 
represents 

the latest battle between 
New York City gun owners, 
represented by the plaintiffs, 
and 
the 
city’s 
stringent 

controls over where they may 
keep their constitutionally-
protected 
handguns. 
At 

stake, 
however, 
may 
be 

much more than the travel 
considerations 
of 
armed 

New Yorkers. Many predict 
a 
broader 
expansion 
of 

gun rights by the Supreme 
Court, in part because the 
court has not often heard 
cases concerning the Second 
Amendment.

However, 
such 

speculation largely obscures 
more relevant gun issues 
that do not require a writ of 
certiorari to debate, namely 
the continuing plague of gun 
violence across the country. 
Supreme 
Court 
decisions, 

to be sure, impact people’s 
lives in big ways. Second 
Amendment 
decisions 
are 

no less impactful. But truly 
addressing gun violence can 
only come through policy and 
policy from legislatures. The 
NYSRPA case, by directing 
our attention to the Supreme 
Court 
and 
its 
judgment, 

counterproductively 
downplays these policies and 
their consequences.

Still, 
panic 
and 

excitement over the case 
are abound. It would be one 
thing if the case was in any 
way predictable. Yet, while 
the Supreme Court did break 
ground in its last two Second 
Amendment 
decisions 
by 

expanding 
“the 
right 
to 

keep and bear arms” to the 

individual and their home, in 
District of Columbia v. Heller 
and McDonald v. Chicago, 

it also left alone 
“longstanding 
prohibitions” 
on 

the 
ownership, 

sales and carrying 
of 
firearms. 
The 

opposite 
case 

also 
remains. 

While 
the 
gun 

control 
measures 

challenged in the 
NYSRPA 
case 

are 
uniquely 

restrictive, even for New 
York’s 
standards, 
a 
less 

expansive ruling could still 
drastically bolster the gun 
lobby’s 
latest 
crusade 
to 

weaken municipal and state 
concealed-carry restrictions.

Those still inclined to 

prognosticate generally view 
Justice Brett Kavanaugh as 

the case’s deciding factor. 
Indeed, 
they 
are 
right 

to 
characterize 
the 
new 

addition 
to 
the 
Supreme 

Court as a staunch Second 
Amendment defender, more 
inclined than former Justice 
Anthony Kennedy to take 
aim at basic firearm sale 
and registration laws. Those 
same pundits would do well 
to consider, however, that the 
conservative majority of the 
Supreme Court that enhanced 
Second 
Amendment 

protections in 2008 and 2010 
still needs Chief Justice John 
G. Roberts Jr. to realize any 
of 
Kavanaugh’s 
pro-gun 

aspirations. Roberts — who 
as chief justice acts not only 
as a judge but also as the 
high court’s “custodian” — 
may well avoid co-signing 
any controversial opinions 
on such an issue as sensitive 
as the Second Amendment. 
Roberts’ cautious tendency 
could hold especially true at a 
time when the Supreme Court 
— steadily losing confidence 
among the American people 
— has already been roped into 
President Donald Trump’s 
nakedly 
partisan 
remarks 

and likely stands to be drawn 
into the contentious border 
wall issue as well.

Surely, it is anyone’s guess 

as to the implications of the 
NYSRPA case. This is all 
the more reason to redirect 
undue attention away from 
gun 
rights 
and 
toward 

gun policy. No liberties — 
even 
those 
protected 
as 

fundamental rights — are 

immune from the realities 
of the people to whom they 
are gifted, and guns are no 
exception. Rates of per capita 
firearm homicides, as well as 
those of per capita suicides, 
are on the rise. When bad 
things continue to happen, 
we 
as 
Americans 
should 

expect policy changes from 
our lawmakers. Guns should 
differ 
from 
other 
policy 

issues only in the degree 
of scrutiny to which their 
restrictions are subjected, 
not in the legality (or lack 
thereof ) 
of 
restrictions 

wholesale.

Nor should guns be held 

up as some sort of permanent 
American fixture immune 
to Constitutional reform. If 
our goal as Americans is to 
reduce the incidence of these 
tragedies (which affect both 
Republican and Democratic 
regions 
of 
the 
country), 

then there are plenty of gun 
control measures that are 
proven to possibly work. If the 
Constitution continues to be 
interpreted as a veto to these 
measures, then the American 
people should be encouraged 
to consider whether that 
same 
constitution 
ought 

to be amended. To decry 
this 
process 
as 
somehow 

“unpatriotic” would neglect 
the Constitution’s deliberate 
adaptability (and one of its 
current amendments).

Of course, gun control 

measures short of repealing 
the Second Amendment still 
infringe 
to 
a 
significant 

degree upon the state of 
freedom in which gun owners 
choose, use and interact with 
their firearms. As with any 
policy, these are the costs of 
attaining a greater good, and 
will have to be incurred by 
someone, somewhere. Those 
“someones,” Americans to 
whom gun rights are not 
mere 
policy 
obstructions 

but deeply cherished parts 
of life, must therefore be 
included 
in 
these 
future 

debates.

Regardless 
of 
where 

these discussions may lead 
us policy-wise, we should 
be having them. For now, 
there 
remain 
many 
gun 

control 
policies 
within 

Constitutional 
reach 
of 

our legislatures, where we 
can 
engage 
one 
another 

instead of idly waiting for 
opinions to be handed down 
to us. Until the Supreme 
Court rules otherwise, we 
should continue to debate 
the efficacy of gun policies 
within 
the 
Constitutional 

confines last set by Heller 
and McDonald. Let us find 
recourse in the halls of 
Congress, not in the gavels 
of justices — even if the 
latter provides for better 
entertainment.

REED ROSENBACHER | COLUMN

Rethinking the engineering humanities requirement

A

lmost every student in a 

major of the humanities 

has 
experienced 
the 

same dreaded moment. It’s 

during the first few weeks 

of class when everybody is 

introducing themselves, when 

the 
classroom 
environment 

is still setting in, that the 

realization 
sets: 
The 
class 

is 
filled 
with 
engineering 

students desperate to fulfill 

their 
300-level 
humanities 

requirement at the University 

of Michigan.

When I experienced my 

first real run-in with this 

phenomenon, my mind swelled 

with 
optimism, 
hoping 
the 

students 
from 
different 

academic 
backgrounds 

could 
offer 
distinct 
and 

valuable contributions to the 

conversation. As the course 

progressed, however, I was met 

with a harsh reality: My “fellow 

classmates” in the engineering 

school, most likely students 

who never had an affinity 

for seminar discussion, were 

filling discussion with hollow 

comments in hopes of earning 

participation credit.

Engineering students who 

have gone through years of 

curriculum 
structured 
by 

endless lecture halls, harsh 

curves and impersonal learning 

environments should not be 

expected to equally contribute 

to a 300-level humanities class. 

The 
upper-level 
humanities 

curriculum is designed with 

two things in mind: that the 

students 
have 
taken 
other 

courses in the humanities and 

that they have a genuine interest 

in the course material. As a 

result, students are expected 

to have developed their skills 

in reading, class participation 

and writing. Students whose 

skills and interests are still 

maturing should pursue lower-

level courses.

Engineering students who 

have spent their years watching 

online lectures and completing 

auto-grader 
homework 

assignments tend not to have 

the experience it takes to 

contribute 
to 
humanities 

courses in a way that elevates 

the conversation. In some ways, 

the requirement as it stands 

feels like a form of disrespect 

to the humanities — no one 

expects a philosophy student 

like myself to survive in a 

random 300-level engineering 

class (I really wouldn’t). Why 

should we expect the opposite?

I want to make clear that my 

point is not that engineering 

students are in some way less 

smart or incapable of valuably 

contributing to a 300-level 

humanities class. In fact, there 

have been some engineering 

students who did have a lot of 

excellent contributions to the 

class, but that tends to be the 

exception, not the rule. Rather, 

engineering students are not 

given the tools or experience to 

help elevate class discussion.

The 
idea 
behind 
the 

requirement is one I fully 

support. Taking engineering 

students out of their comfort 

zones and putting them in 

contact 
with 
more 
critical 

and personal disciplines is a 

wonderful idea. I even think 

that having the requirement 

be an upper-level class with 

in-depth seminar discussions 

is a good idea. I simply question 

whether the current approach 

is 
effective. 
From 
here, 
I 

will weigh a few potential 

proposals as a starting point for 

rethinking this issue.

Proposal 
1: 
Offer 

humanities 
classes 
designed 

for 
engineering 
students. 

The School of Art & Design, 

for example, offers classes to 

non-majors. The idea behind 

this curriculum is that non-

art students should have a way 

of pursuing the arts without 

having to do so in the confines 

of a classroom filled with 

aspiring artists. This proposal 

would solve the issue of filling 

LSA humanities classes with 

engineering students who take 

away from class discussion 

due to their lack of experience, 

disinterest or some combination 

thereof. The problem with this 

proposal, however, is that the 

“humanities classes for non-

humanities 
majors” 
would 

become an echo chamber that 

wouldn’t provide engineering 

students 
with 
the 
“outside 

perspective” the requirement 

is built to give. I also fear 

these classes may run the risk 

of 
becoming 
“joke 
classes” 

or 
classes 
they 
don’t 
find 

challenging. 

Proposal 2: Create a cap 

on the number of engineering 

students who can enroll in a 

specific humanities class. In all 

honesty, much of my irritation 

stems from my experience in a 

300-level philosophy class that 

was dominated by engineering 

students. 
The 
engineering 

students took the class because 

it hit three birds with one 

stone: It fulfilled the race 

and 
ethnicity 
requirement, 

the 
300-level 
humanities 

requirement and was rumored 

to be “easy.” If there were only 

a few engineering students 

in any given class, then the 

class discussion would not be 

hampered and the engineering 

students could really engage 

in 
productive 
seminar 

discussion. On the other hand, 

this proposal would prevent 

some 
engineering 
students 

who do have real interests in 

the humanities from getting 

into the classes they want and 

would make them feel even 

more like they are being forced 

to do something. Additionally, 

this just seems like a cruel 

idea to implement from an 

institutional level.

Proposal 
3: 
Require 

engineering students to take 

more 
humanities 
classes! 

Maybe, 
instead 
of 
creating 

odd concoctions that account 

for 
engineering 
students’ 

lack 
of 
experience 
in 
the 

humanities, 
engineering 

students could just receive a 

more holistic education. Some 

kinks regarding fitting it in 

the schedule would obviously 

have to be worked out, but the 

requirement could be expanded 

to something along the lines 

of 12 humanities credits with 

a minimum of two upper-level 

humanities classes.

All three of these proposals 

have benefits and flaws to 

them. None of them should be 

viewed as a perfect solution, 

but they all do serve as starting 

points for fixing this issue. 

The sad truth is that many 

students in the humanities 

have experienced signing up 

for a class to pursue a genuine 

interest, only to find a classroom 

filled 
with 
inexperienced 

engineering students looking to 

fill requirements. On the other 

hand engineering students do 

seek out “easy” humanities 

classes to fill their requirement 

instead of truly expanding their 

academic horizons. Something 

needs to be done to create a 

learning environment that is 

more satisfying to everyone’s 

academic needs.

On day four of Sundance, I 
noticed a pattern in my note-
taking. If I enjoyed a movie, I 
would only write a few details 
in my journal. If I didn’t enjoy 
a movie, I would scribble down 
criticisms like a madman and 
sometimes doodle during the 
more 
cringe-worthy 
scenes. 
This dichotomy became no more 
apparent than when I saw Lulu 
Wang’s excellent dramedy “The 
Farewell,” Joe Berlinger’s awful 
Ted Bundy biopic “Extremely 
Wicked, Shockingly Vile and 
Evil” and Joe Talbot’s immensely 
cool “The Last Black Man in San 
Francisco.”
For “The Farewell” and “The 
Last Black Man,” my notes were 
minimal. I simply relished in 
watching both movies with the 
rest of the crowd, who were 
as receptive as I was to each 
film’s moments of humor and 
melancholy. As for “Extremely 
Wicked,” my notes took up two 
pages. I tried looking around to 
see if there were other audience 
members who were just as baffled 
as I was, but to my surprise, 
everyone seemed engaged with 
what was essentially a watered-
down romanticization of one of 
America’s most notable serial 
killers.
The movie theater etiquette was 
much better today than the two 
days before, with the exception of 
the guy sitting next to me during 
“The Farewell,” who took out his 
phone at least five times to text 
someone, look up who was in the 
movie (wait until the credits, bro!) 
and open and close Hinge. After 

boiling with fury in my seat and 
waiting for the right moment, I 
politely whispered to him to turn 
off his phone. His response? “It’s a 
press screening. You can take out 
your phone.” Sigh. The audacity!
As the day went on, Sundance-
goers seemed more and more 
exhausted. The general vibe of 
weariness while waiting in line 
for each screening was apparent: 
people glued to their phones, 
fatigue plastered on their faces, 
clearly worn out by the constant 
standing, 
sitting 
and 
visual 
stimuli. It was only after each 
screening that the energy shifted 
into something more excited. 
Crowds of critics would stand 
outside in the hallways of the 
theater, chatting and exchanging 
interpretations with intense vigor 
on what they just saw. Even when 
the hours and hours of watching 
movies felt like a chore, the post-
screening conversations would 
beg to differ. 

‘The Farewell’:
Happiness is too simple a 
word to describe how I felt 
watching Lulu Wang’s delightful 
sophomore effort “The Farewell.” 
Adapted by Wang from a real-life 
story she narrated on NPR’s “This 
American Life,” this film is truly 
a phenomenal feat, the best kind 
of dramedy where joy and grief 
are intertwined to complement 
one another rather than exist 
adjacently. By avoiding the cliché 
trappings 
of 
intergenerational 
stories — rigid immigrant parents 
vs. assimilated children — “The 
Farewell” seeks to understand 
how secrets and lies are sometimes 
the only way we can protect those 
we love most.
As dramatic as that illustration 

seems, “The Farewell” produces 
plenty of laughs, most of which 
stem from the main character 
Billi (an outstanding Awkwafina, 
“Ocean’s 
8”), 
a 
wisecracking 
Brooklyn-based 
writer 
who 
discovers that her grandma Nai 
Nai (newcomer Shuzhen Zhou) 
has fallen ill with terminal cancer. 
The twist: Nai Nai has no clue, and 
Billi’s parents (Tzi Ma, “Arrival” 
and Diana Lin, “Australia Day”) 
intend to keep it that way. Feeling 
guilty and helpless, Billi follows 
her parents to China to spend 
time with Nai Nai and the rest of 
her extended family, all of whom 
are aware of Nai Nai’s condition, 
but decide to use Billi’s hapless 
cousin’s wedding as the reason for 
why they are all gathered together 
for the first time in years. 
Rather than take a more farcical 
path, “The Farewell” focuses on 
exploring the tension between the 
illusory safeguard of happiness 
with the reality of sadness. 
Billi’s multifaceted ensemble of a 
family is prone to this emotional 
strain, diverging from a sad 
subject whenever it appears in 
conversation over dinner. The 
suppression 
of 
deep-seated 
sorrow, especially in a family 
setting, is something that almost 
everyone can relate to on a certain 
level, but through the lens of the 
Chinese-American experience, it 
takes on a much greater weight. 
Growing up in America, Billi 
knows exactly why it’s so wrong to 
lie to her grandmother about her 
illness. But as she learns during 
her time in China, she recognizes 
that it’s customary to keep this 
kind of information away from 
loved ones until the final moments 
of their life so the ill don’t have to 
carry that burden. It’s a revelation 

that’s as devastating for Billi as it 
is for the audience.
Despite the bleakness in this 
tradition, 
“The 
Farewell” 
is 
skillful enough to find the humor 
in the quiet suffering Billi and 
her family are forced to endure. 
We see it during Billi’s cupping 
therapy session at a Chinese spa, 
where her aunt tells her that “a 
little pain is normal, otherwise 
it doesn’t work.” We witness it 
during a visit to her grandfather’s 
grave, where Billi and her family 
present offerings that include a 
variety of snacks, flower petals 
and a cigarette, even though her 
grandfather had allegedly quit 
smoking while alive. We observe 
it at her cousin’s extravagant 
wedding banquet, where her 
uncle delivers a heartbreaking 
monologue 
about 
Nai 
Nai, 
bookending his tearful speech 
with an equally comical and 
poignant irony: “Sorry, I’m just so 
happy.”
It cannot be emphasized enough 
how 
incredible 
Awkwafina’s 
performance is in “The Farewell.” 
The 
up-and-coming 
actress/
rapper from Queens made huge 
strides in two of the biggest 
summer movies from last year, 
“Ocean’s 8” and “Crazy Rich 
Asians.” 
Here, 
Awkwafina 
continues to flex her comedic 
sensibilities, while showing off 
her dramatic range with superb 
naturalism. Zhou also provides a 
beautiful, measured performance 
as Nai Nai. For a first-time actress, 
she excels in her role, balancing 
a 
sensitive 
earnestness 
with 
infectiously 
adorable 
charm. 
Her on-screen relationship with 
Awkwafina is also quite sweet and 
authentic, their intimate banter 
making it seem as if they were 
actually related.
Though it may check off all the 
boxes of a Sundance dramedy, 
“The Farewell” does everything 
in its glorious power to transcend 
that expectation. It’s a film for 
everyone, but also manages to 
infuse a compelling amount of 
specificity into its universal story. 
Not to overhype the film, but I’ll 
be damned if “The Farewell” isn’t 
nominated for Best Picture at the 
2020 Oscars.

‘Extremely Wicked, Shockingly 
Evil and Vile’:
True 
crime 
documentarian 
Joe Berlinger’s narrative debut 
derives its laborious title from a 
quote used against nefarious serial 
killer Ted Bundy for committing a 
series of brutal killings between 
1974 and 1978. But after seeing 
the film in full, perhaps it should 
be retitled to “Extremely Dumb, 
Shockingly Inept and Vile” not 
only for romanticizing Ted Bundy 

— who, mind you, kidnapped, 
murdered and raped a multitude 
of women — to an absurd degree, 
but also failing to capture what 
makes 
the 
much-talked-about 
subject so complex and fascinating 
in the first place.
Aside 
from 
the 
gross 
glamorization of Bundy’s image, 
“Extremely 
Wicked” 
is 
just 
another oversimplified, by-the-
numbers biopic, fulfilling every 
single 
possible 
facet 
of 
the 
formula you can think of. There’s 
a predictable claim to fame and 
inevitable downfall, a way too 
on-the-nose soundtrack, an excess 
of exposition explained through 
archival footage and dramatized 
interviews and, worst of all, 
strangely generic dialogue for 
events that actually took place.
In 
its 
rushed 
first 
act, 
“Extremely Wicked” introduces us 
to Bundy (Zac Efron, “Neighbors”) 
on the day preceding his execution 
in 1989 before transitioning to a 
Seattle bar 20 years earlier where 
he meets and falls in love with 
single mother Liz (Lily Collins, 
“To the Bone”). While Collins 
and Efron have decent chemistry, 
their relationship is established 
a little too quickly, condensing 
the time between when they 
first meet to when they start 
living together to less than a few 
minutes. Bundy’s transformation 
from regular nice-guy law student 
to murder suspect also occurs 
within a minimal timespan, and 
while the efficiency of this shift 
in his character certainly helps 
with the pacing, the lack of actual 
dimension given to Bundy and his 
romance with Liz makes it more 
difficult to stay interested.
The film ostensibly is supposed 
to take place from the perspective 
of Liz, who, like Bundy, was in 
complete denial that he carried 
out any of the heinous acts he was 
accused of. Strangely, however, 
“Extremely Wicked” dedicates 
more of its screen time to Bundy 
himself, leaving only a string of 
scenes with Liz, whose sullen 
reaction 
to 
Bundy’s 
growing 
reputation as a ruthless felon is 
limited to crying in the shower, 
drinking and smoking all day, 
staring somberly at the TV news 
and getting mad at her disposable 
character of a best friend Joanna 
(Angela Sarafyan, “The Promise”) 
for forcing Liz to face the truth.
Though it may be accurate that 
Bundy lured his victims using 
his charisma and supposedly 
good looks, attaching Efron and 
his handsomeness to the real-
life serial killer feels somewhat 
distracting, like something out 
of a melodrama (Penn Badgley in 
“You,” anyone?). Transforming 
Bundy into an ultra-appealing 
hunk is an intriguing attempt at 

making the audience sympathize 
with his character, suggesting that 
any hottie with a naughty body 
could have malicious intentions. 
Still, despite Efron’s best efforts 
in 
embodying 
Bundy, 
from 
his cunning personality to his 
luscious head of hair, the dreadful 
emptiness of “Extremely Wicked” 
outweighs 
his 
serviceable 
performance by a long shot.
Buried within the murky mess 
of the film’s skeletal plot are a few 
fleeting — emphasis on “fleeting” — 
moments of genuinely captivating 
entertainment. A goateed, very 
good 
John 
Malkovich 
(“Bird 
Box”) plays Edward Cowart, the 
snarky judge who presided over 
Bundy’s final trial in Florida, and 
delivers some of the very rare 
great lines of dialogue during the 
climactic third act. Bundy’s brief 
escapes from his jail sentences 
are fun to watch too, so much so 
that they almost make you forget 
just how abhorrent the film is as 
a whole. The final confrontation 
between Liz and Bundy on the day 
of his death sentence is really the 
only true moment in the entire 108 
minutes of “Extremely Wicked” 
where a great deal of tension 
is palpable, in that we actually 
get to see, through flashback, 
Bundy carry out one of his many 
documented killings.
Then again, why does the 
movie try to make us sympathize 
with Bundy? In addition to 
narrativizing Bundy’s experience 
in the public through the guise 
of a glitzy thriller, “Extremely 
Wicked” 
provides 
no 
solid 
justification for why we should 
spend 
our 
time 
following 
Bundy, no plausible end goal 
in questioning what motivated 
him to be so cruel and relentless. 
Some might find better answers 
in the recently released Netflix 
docuseries “Conversations with 
a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,” 
which was also produced by 
Berlinger, or even FX’s “American 
Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. 
Simpson,” a much more well-
developed and layered drama that 
focused on a different famous 
alleged murderer who consistently 
denied the terrible things he 
was accused of. If “Extremely 
Wicked” proves to be a box office 
success once it’s released in 
theaters, it won’t be because of the 
promise of understanding Bundy 
on a more psychological level, but 
rather, it will be solely due to the 
undeniable appeal of Efron’s star 
power, a reality as unsettling as 
Bundy’s impact on the cultural 
consciousness.

The vibes of Still Woozy’s 
live concert can be perfectly 
synopsized by the first 10 seconds 
of his music video for the song 
“Goodie Bag.” There’s this brief, 
pure moment when Sven Gamsky 
(Still Woozy) holds up a photo 
of himself and asks, “Who’s 
that fucking pig nose?” after 
which his friend questions if the 
video is doomed to fail from the 
outset. It quickly cuts, and in 
comes the dreamy, woozy sound 
of “Goodie Bag.” I swear these 
first 10 seconds of endearing self-
depreciation play a monumental 
role in the video’s 1.7 million 
views. Take the wholesomeness 
of those opening 10 seconds and 
extend it for an hour and a half 
set at El Club, and you get Still 
Woozy live. 
It’s 
awkward, 
but 
it’s 
a 
confident 
awkward. 
Sven 
Gamsky is the poster child for 
“I see myself as a gawky lad” 
persona, yet coolness exudes 
from every bone in his body, with 
that groovy, woozy sound leaving 
me gawking. His stage presence 

consists of intense head bops 
with wide eyes and shimmies 
that could pass as an attempt 
at The Chicken Dance. I never 
knew 
chicken-arm 
shimmies 
could be so damn cool. Gamsky 
grasps the essence of “Hi, I’m 
awkward!” paired with a boyish 
charm. Yet, his groovy sound has 
artsy college kids bending over 
backwards to brand themselves 
in a similar way. This vibe he 
radiates makes a 19-year old girl 
with an English major and fresh-
cut bangs step slightly closer to 
self-actualization (I speak from 
experience).
Walking into the concert, I 
couldn’t help but question how he 
would fill an entire concert with 
only six songs. These six songs 
(which fall somewhere between 
lo-fi, electric, acoustic and indie) 
were written and produced in 
his garage. You can add Still 
Woozy to the list of recently 
successful D.I.Y. artists, for his 
garage approach has landed him 
a spot on Coachella’s lineup this 
upcoming April.
When choosing how to fill 
his time, he made some stellar 
choices and some mediocre ones. 

The stellar choices included 
repeating “Lucy” for his encore 
and playing two songs off of his 
new EP (which, according to 
Instagram, should be released 
this month). These fresh songs 
push 
into 
Gamsky’s 
upper 
register and even feature some 
“rapping” (the sort of rap that 
Rex Orange County creates). 
Moreover, 
Gamsky 
attacked 
two phenomenal covers: Mac 
Demarco’s “Still Beating” and 
Hank 
Williams’s 
“Angel 
of 
Death.”
The mediocre choices, on the 
other hand, included a “dance-
off” 
between 
his 
drummer 
and synth-player for this tour: 
Skinny Pete and Tiny. About 
half-way through, Skinny and 
Tiny competed on the dance 
floor while Gamsky narrated 
from the side. Remember how we 
talked about awkwardness, but 
the sort of awkwardness that’s 
so cool and endearing it makes a 
girl with bangs (me) freak out in 
admiration?

The most influential character in 
Mary Adkins’ debut novel “When 
You Read This” is not even alive at 
the time the novel takes place. Iris 
Massey is a 33 year old who died 
months after being diagnosed with 
small-cell carcinoma, a deadly lung 
cancer commonly developed by 
smokers.
Iris’s death has a profound 
impact on those around her. 
There’s her sister, Jade, a chef at 
a Michelin starred restaurant in 
New York City, who hasn’t gone 
back to work since her sister’s 
death. There’s Iris’s boss, Smith 
Simonyi, the president of brand 
management firm who’s struggling 
to keep his business afloat. And 
there’s the hundreds of people who 
follow her blog.
When Iris discovered she was 
dying, she turned to a website 
named “Dying to Blog,” a place 
where people who are dying 
can come together and form a 
community. 
Smith 
discovers 
her blog and her wish to have it 
published after her death, which 
leads him into contact with Jade 
and a journey of self discovery and 
realization.
Adkins 
weaves 
the 
story 
together out of excerpts from Iris’s 
blog, email and texts between 
various characters, as well as 
other forms of media like Jade’s 
submissions to a therapy website. 
The majority of the story focuses on 
the relationship between Jade and 
Smith as they try to come to terms 

with Iris’s passing. While they first 
email about cleaning Iris’s things 
out of the office, their emailing 
quickly evolves into confidences 
shared by the closest friends.
After Iris’s death, the one true 
spot of light in their lives is a new 
intern Smith hires named Carl. 
Carl is an extremely outgoing and 
intelligent college student who 
has a habit of sending emails to 
people he shouldn’t, something 

that conveniently propels the plot 
forward on numerous occasions. 
While Carl’s optimistic outlook and 
wit brings humor and a refreshing 
lightness to a story that deals with 
such heavy subject matter, he is 
undeniably a terrible intern. It’s 
hard to believe at times that he 
would not have been fired within 
his first few days of working at the 
office. The fact that Smith keeps 
him on makes the story somewhat 
less believable, but the loss is 
worth it for the enjoyment Carl’s 
character provides.
Iris’s contemplation of death 
and how a person makes peace 
with death are the most thought-

provoking and interesting parts of 
the novel. She records her feelings 
on her blog with topics ranging 
from her reaction to seeing images 
of the cancer that’s killing her to 
her relationship with Jade. Readers 
also see the comments left on 
her blog and come to know the 
commenters as well as Iris herself. 
The formatting of Iris’s blog, in 
addition to the email formatting 
used 
throughout 
the 
novel, 
makes for a story that keeps the 
attention of readers in a way that 
is easy to read and follow. Iris 
uses drawings and pictures to 
communicate how she feels about 
having cancer. It’s an intimate 
presentation that helps both Iris 
and readers contemplate dying.
For a book whose back claims 
it’s “for fans of Rainbow Rowell,” 
it does not exactly deliver. The 
characters don’t have as much 
depth and aren’t as realistic 
or relatable as those in some 
of Rowell’s works like “Fangirl” 
or “Eleanor and Park.” They 
aren’t as well defined and have 
more static personalities as well. 
With the exception of Carl, they 
don’t stand out as individuals as 
much as they could. Distinct and 
vibrant characters are hallmarks 
of Rowell’s novels, and are simply 
not as present in “When You Read 
This.”“When You Read This” 
does lead readers to contemplate 
intriguing 
and 
important 
philosophical questions, such as 
what makes life worth living and 
how, if at all, the dead should be 
honored, but it lacks in plot and 
character development.

Picture Arts and Sciences says 
to a movie, “You are the best 
picture of the year,” what are 
they really indicating?
The Academy itself explains, 
“We recognize and uphold 
excellence 
in 
the 
motion 
picture 
arts 
and 
sciences, 
inspire 
imagination, 
and 
connect the world through the 
medium of motion pictures.” 
This lofty mission statement 
is worth unpacking, and, with 
the Academy Awards coming 
up this month, worth testing. 
Controversial 
Best 
Picture 
nominee “Green Book” gives a 
perfect occasion for such a test.
In the context of Best Picture 
nominations, recognizing and 
upholding “excellence,” implies 
that the Academy just wants 
to honor the most remarkable 
film of the year. But this is 
an annual award, so there is 
no such thing as an isolated 
incident in a yearly contest. By 
design, the Academy is always 
in the process of scribing and 
publicizing its own history. 

So this year’s nominations do 
more than tell us that each 
movie is one we should have 
seen this year or that it stands 
out at a particular moment in 
time. With the force 
of history behind 
the 
nominations, 
the 
Academy 
indicates to us: This 
is a movie that tells 
you something you 
need to hear, and 
you probably have 
not heard it before 
— at the very least, 
you’ve never heard 
it in such articulate 
terms.
“Green 
Book” 
wants to be just 
that: 
a 
unique, 
articulate entry into 
the canon of Best 
Picture nominees. It 
wants to be thought 
of as progressive, 
as a story which 
rewrites the long, 
disturbing 
history 
of race relations in 
American 
history.
But it is none of these things.
It is the story of a historically 

unlikely 
friendship 
that 
emerges in the 1960s between 
a Black pianist and his white 
driver and bodyguard as they 
venture into the Deep South. 
The two men 
learn 
from 
each 
other, 
but 
consider 
what audience 
members 
learn 
from 
their 
dynamic: 
That 
white 
men 
will 
respond 
to 
the 
realities 
of racism by 
fighting 
for 
rather 
than 
with 
Black 
men. 
In 
other words, 
that even in 
supposed 
narratives 
of resistance 
to 
racism, 
white 
men 
will be billed 
lead 
actor 
and Black men will remain 
members of the secondary, 

supporting cast. At least, this is 
how “Green Book” understood 
it; Viggo Mortensen (“Eastern 
Promises”) 
is 
the 
lead 
to 
Mahershala Ali’s (“Moonlight”) 
supporting role.
Beyond what the film tells 
us by itself, what are we saying 
when we reward it? What do 
we reward when we reward 
“Green Book”?
We saw a preview of the 
answer at the Golden Globes, 
where “Green Book” took home 
Best Motion Picture – Musical 
or 
Comedy. 
Particularly, 
we 
watched 
“Green 
Book” 
screenwriter Nick Vallelonga 
take the stage for the second 
time 
(after 
winning 
Best 
Screenplay 
for 
the 
same 
film). Nick Vallelonga, one 
of 
multiple 
filmmakers 
involved with “Green Book,” 
unsurprisingly 
attracted 
advancing problematic rhetoric 
outside of the film. Though 
he has since deleted the tweet 
and 
apologized, 
Vallelonga 
retweeted President Trump’s 
claim that he saw Muslims in 
New Jersey celebrating the fall 
of the Twin Towers on Sep. 11, 
2001. In some ways, “Green 
Book” is just like Vallelonga’s 
Twitter scandal: a statement 
that recirculates sentiments 
adverse to social progress in the 
United States. The difference is 
that Vallelonga was pressured 
to apologize for the damage 
his Twitter post did. Despite 
its problematic content, award 
shows continue to commend 
him for “Green Book.”
If we reward “Green Book” 
a Best Picture prize for the 
second time, we continue to 
curb momentum. Slow down. 
Pipe down. Back down. It tells 
white people there is no need 
to use their racial privilege 
to work against the system 
of 
privilege 
itself; 
rather, 
it is enough to reconsider 
prejudices and wage quiet, 
halfhearted resistance. It tells 
Black people it is their job 
to teach white people about 
racism — but that white people 
will remain the protagonists, 
the 
main 
characters, 
the 
saviors 
in 
any 
subsequent 
struggle 
for 
equality. 
We 
gesture toward the myth of a 
post-racial 
America 
instead 
of confronting the continued, 
urgent realities of racism.
Wanting to be progressive 
isn’t 
enough. 
Rewarding 
fraudulent 
progressivism 
is 
threatening. I hope we set our 
sights higher.

What we reward when we 
celebrate ‘Green Book’

FILM NOTEBOOK

UNIVERSAL PICTURES

I am the Lord thy God

I. Thou shalt have no other 
Gods before me 
— and I promised You there 
wouldn’t be. I’m not sorry.
 II. Thou shalt not make unto 
thee any graven image
— but she ironically wears this 
cheap plastic cross necklace that 
she won at a claw machine in the 
arcade downtown. When she 
hovered over me, it kept tapping 
my nose and we both couldn’t stop 
laughing. I was so happy. I’m not 
sorry.
III. Thou shalt not take thy 
name of thy Lord in vain
— but, oh my. God, it is so 
unfair of You to create someone 
that thinks it’s cute (!?) when my 
palms get sweaty, and then tell me 
it’s a sin to want to hold her hand. 
I held her hand. I’m not sorry.
IV. Remember the sabbath day 
to keep it holy
— but how could I possibly 
remember anything when she 
keeps 
texting 
me 
restaurant 
recommendations and photos of 
her aunt’s cat? I couldn’t focus 
on You with the excitement of 
my phone buzzing, and her name 
shining brightly on my screen. 
She put a sparkly heart emoji next 
to her contact. I’m not sorry.
V. Honor thy Father and thy 
Mother
— can I still honor them, even 
if I keep the most vital parts of me 
locked away in a crimson chest 
beneath the dirty dresses in my 
closet? I don’t think so. (I am a 
little sorry about this one.)
VI. Thou shalt not kill
— but I just want the secret 
online chat rooms, the rainbow 
pins, my daydreams of Kristen 
Stewart, the way I felt when she 
remembered my favorite song, to 
die. I want to kill it. I want to bury 
it beneath the ground and let it 
rot amongst the tombstones of my 
ancestors, never to see the light of 
day again. This is Your fault. I’m 
not sorry.
VII. Thou shalt not commit 
adultery
— but everytime my new 
“boyfriend” grabs my thigh, I look 

down and wish his nails were 
painted that dark shade of purple 
that was always a little bit chipped 
on hers. I wish he was wearing far 
too many rings for his fingers and 
that wristband from the Vampire 
Weekend concert she went to 
three years ago that she refused 
to take off. I’m disappointed when 
he tells me he loves me. I’m not 
sorry.
VIII. Thou shalt not steal
— but I can’t stop stealing 
glances at her in class as she 
scribbles 
out 
all 
her 
words 
because she thinks erasers are 
lame. She puts her hair up in 
a ponytail. She always said it 
“helped her concentrate,” but I 
lose my train of thought as the 
circular red marks down her neck 
are quickly revealed. I can’t help 
but wonder if the perpetrator of 
this skin-sucking made a map of 
the freckles down her torso that 
leads directly to home, like I did. 
I miss her. I’m not sorry…
IX. Thou shalt not bear false 
witness against thy neighbor
— but it’s so hard to say 
anything besides “I’m okay,” when 
the words “I loved a girl” don’t fit 
right in my mouth. And when my 
mom tells me I’m wasting water 
by constantly washing all my bed 
sheets, I don’t tell her it’s because 
I can’t seem to get the rosy scent 
of that expensive perfume my 
ex-girlfriend stole from her sister 
out of my blankets. I say I spilt earl 
grey tea, and the stain just won’t 
wash away.
And when I lie in bed at night 
and my mind drifts to the thought 
of long eyelashes and soft lips and 
curves, I tell myself that this is 
what every girl does. This is what 
every girl does. I’m not weird. I’m 
not sorry.
X. Thou shalt not covet
— but I envy everyone who’s 
never met her, and I envy everyone 
who will ever get to meet her for 
the first time. I envy those who 
can follow You blissfully because 
I have sinned in more ways than 
one. I have bent down on my 
knees for all the wrong reasons, 
but You have to understand that 
she was the only one who ever 
showed me any faith. God, I don’t 
really believe in you, but I can’t 
believe myself. I guess maybe I’m 
the one I should be apologizing to.

Talking with Ten 
Commandments

Junior year fall break I 
spontaneously decided to go 
on a road trip to Montreal 
with a few friends. It was 
an ambitious decision that 
entailed driving nearly 20 
hours within a four-day span, 
but I found myself packing up 
a small suitcase anyways. I 
didn’t even particularly care 
about seeing Montreal, but it 
was junior year and I had an 
itch to leave Ann Arbor and 
never look back.
The trip itself was a blur. 
Montreal was too cloudy and 
supplied too much alcohol 
for me to remember much 
of 
anything. 
There 
was 
only one moment that has 
remained crystal clear within 
my mind: driving back from 
Montreal at the break of 
dawn, horrifically hungover 
and weighed down with a 
bone-deep fatigue, playing the 
entirety of Vampire Weekend’s 
Modern Vampires of the City 
from start to finish as the 
barren Canadian countryside 
sped past our windows. As 
momentous memories go, this 

one is particularly nondescript, 
but I close my eyes and there 
I am: hands curled around 
the steering wheel, all other 
passengers passed out in near 
comas, half crying but also half 
smiling because even though 
Montreal took more out of 
me than I thought it would, 
the way this small, ragtag 
collective 
of 
polo-wearing 
preps infused charisma and 
hope into their distinct blend 
of indie pop made even the 
churning unknown of lands 
outside of Ann Arbor seem less 
imposing. 
Vampire 
Weekend 
has 
always been with me, even 
before 
the 
unfortunate 
Montreal trip. High school 
was soundtracked by the 
whimsical Afro-pop of their 
first self-titled album, by the 
shameless 
eccentricity 
of 
Contra, by the slightly more 
serious overcast of Modern 
Vampires. The inside of my 
friend’s car always hummed 
with “Unbelievers”’s bouncing 
optimism on the way back from 
school. The summer before 
I left for college, “Hannah 
Hunt” put a gossamer tint over 
the sky; I would tilt my head 

back against the low arc of 
the setting sun as the delayed 
tempo change pushed the song 
into motion and be filled with 
a 
nearly 
incomprehensible 
serenity.
Vampire Weekend emerged 
from the shadow of a post-
Strokes New York — leather 
jackets were traded in for boat 
shoes, the sweaty raucous 
of 
hole-in-the-wall 
venues 
at the heart of the city were 
replaced 
by 
manicured 
lawns and the crisp prestige 
of Columbia University. On 
paper, 
Vampire 
Weekend’s 
clean-cut 
pretentiousness 
seemed to pale in comparison 
with the grimy authenticity of 
their predecessors, yet as the 
post-9/11 alternative rock era 
of New York City started to rip 
itself to shreds, they emerged 
like a beacon of light, quiet 
and sincere in their mission 
to make music that not only 
reached far past the bounds 
of the city itself but also never 
took itself too seriously.
The 
main 
appeal 
of 
Vampire Weekend was in their 
playfulness. Even the band’s 
name came from the title of a 
short film project lead vocalist 

and guitarist Ezra Koenig 
created sometime during his 
early years at Columbia about 
a man who traveled to Cape 
Cod in order to warn the 
president that vampires were 
attacking the United States. 
The project was abandoned 
in record time, but that initial 
spurt of juvenile creativity was 
never lost, resulting in albums 
that tiptoed the line between 
exuberance and childishness. 
There was always an air of 
lightheartedness 
around 
Vampire Weekend, one that 
allowed you to listen to their 
music over and over again 
without getting bored.
This past week, Vampire 
Weekend dropped two new 
singles in preparation for their 
upcoming album, Father of the 
Bride. The songs “Harmony 
Hall” and “2021” came after 
nearly five years of complete 
silence. The buzz the singles 
created was real and tangible, 
as people found within the 
plodding melody of “Harmony 
Hall,” in the drawn out notes 
of “2021,” an opportunity to 
relive the rosiest parts of their 
youth.
And yet, I couldn’t help but 
be disappointed, at “2021,” at 
“Harmony Hall,” at Vampire 
Weekend 
themselves 
for 
re-emerging with the blandest 
possible 
version 
of 
their 
infamous early 2000s sound. 
Carefree no longer, there is 
a certain anticlimax within 
these two songs. Ezra Koenig, 
weighed down by the passage 
of time, is at his most serious, 
his most mature, as he turns 
back to look at the legacy he 
created. “I don’t wanna live 
like this but I don’t wanna die” 
he says in “Harmony Hall,” 
echoing a line from Modern 
Vampires of the City, but rather 
than sound nostalgic he just 
sounds regretful, pushing to 
once again embody a vivacity 
that has long since died out.

Has Vampire Weekend 
always been dad rock?

Michigan accelerating into 2019

The sport of lacrosse is 
speeding up, and Michigan is 
poised to capitalize on new shot-
clock regulations as it amps up 
for the 2019 season.
In an attempt to accelerate the 
pace of the game and facilitate a 
more exciting, aggressive play 
strategy, NCAA rulemakers have 
followed professional lacrosse 
leagues by implementing an 
80-second shot clock for the 
upcoming men’s lacrosse season.
“We want to play a more 
up-tempo style,” said Michigan 
coach Kevin Conry. “We have 
the horses to do it.”
Conry’s “horses” include nine 
of 10 returning starters from last 
season, who accounted for 87 
percent of the team’s offensive 
productivity in 2018.
“(They) have a good sense of 
where the ball should go and 
when it should go there,” said 
Conry.
After tying the program’s 
single-season win record with 
eight in his first season at 
the helm of the Wolverines’ 
coaching staff, Conry is eager to 
test out the new rules and more 
fast-paced playing philosophies 
with his experienced core.
Of the returning starters, 
most notable is senior midfielder 

Brent Noseworthy, the first 
USILA All-American in team 
history and a 2019 preseason 
All-Big Ten honoree. In 2018, 
Noseworthy 
led 
the 
team 
with 48 points and 41 goals, 
propelling the Wolverines to 
signature wins over highly-
ranked opponents Notre Dame 
and Penn State.
Behind the goal at X is 
sophomore 
attackman 
Kevin 
Mack, who could be poised for 
another successful campaign as 
the quarterback of the Michigan 
offense following a breakout 
freshman season, in which he 
led the team with 21 assists. 
Despite his relative youth, Mack 
has already proven to be a leader 
and force of nature on the field.
“Behind the net, seeing what 
the defense is doing to us … it 
gives (me) good perspective,” 
Mack said. “I can be a leader in 
communication.”
On the other side of the 
field, senior defenseman Nick 
DeCaprio, who led the Big Ten 
with 23 caused turnovers last 
year and led the Wolverines 
with 46 ground balls, is primed 
to be Michigan’s top defender. 
Between the pipes is graduate 
student goalie Tommy Heidt, 
who missed the first six games 
of the 2018 season but retains his 
starting job going into 2019.
In 
front 
of 
Heidt, 
the 

Wolverines defense has adjusted 
well to the quickened pace 
of the game in practices and 
exhibitions.
“Our defense is playing better 
with it,” praised Mack. “(They 
are) really good at locking teams 
down.”
Dark horses in a challenging 
Big Ten conference, Michigan 
has finished last in the conference 
the past three seasons but seeks 
to run the table against East-
Coast lacrosse powerhouses like 
2017 NCAA champion Maryland 
and historically-dominant Johns 
Hopkins.
New 
to 
the 
Wolverines 
assistant coaching staff is Major 
League Lacrosse midfielder and 
Duke graduate Justin Turri. 
Conry has praised Turri since 
his arrival in Ann Arbor.
“He has a lot of experience 
with shot clock (management). 
He’s a great developer,” Conry 
said. “He’s a guy who can take 
our guys, make them good 
players, and take them one step 
further to greatness.”
With a strong veteran player 
presence and the addition of 
Turri, Conry is very hopeful 
for what will come of the 2019 
season and his experienced 
roster.
“The game is much faster 
(now),” Conry said. “But we can’t 
get caught up in it.”

‘M’ sees mixed results on weekend

The 
men’s 
and 
women’s 
track and field teams came 
away with quite a few victories 
along with some disappointing 
performances at this weekend’s 
Power Five Invitational.
The Wolverines hosted nine 
teams at the new Michigan 
Indoor Track Building during 
the two-day event.
The men started off strong 
Friday, doing particularly well 
in the preliminary heats of the 
60-meter hurdle event. Junior 
Roland Amarteifio led the pack 
with a career-best time of 8.01 
seconds. Three of the other four 
Michigan athletes in the race 
qualified for the final and ended 
up taking the third, fourth, 
sixth and seventh places.
The Wolverines also had 
success in the men’s 60-meter 
dash. 
Freshman 
Asani 
Hampton took the top spot 
with a time of 6.77 seconds, his 
new career best. The next day, 
Hampton outpaced much of 
the competition en route to a 
second place finish.
Michigan was no stranger to 
broken records this weekend 
with a total of 34 career-bests 
set between the men and the 
women.
While the men excelled in 

the short races, the women 
found better results in the mid-
distance runs, particularly the 
400, 600, and 800-meter events.
Junior Jade Harrison and 
sophomore 
Chloe 
Foster 
secured 
first 
and 
second 
place, respectively, separated 
by a mere .26 seconds in the 
deceivingly 
long 
400-meter 
race.
“400 (meters) doesn’t seem 
very long but it is,” Harrison 
said. 
“Finishing 
strong 
is 
definitely a hard part that I’m 
going to try to work on.”
The 
women’s 
600-meter 
event went just as well for the 
Wolverines, who earned four of 
the top-eight times. Foster came 
in first, adding to her successful 
400-meter performance.
In 
the 
800-meter 
race, 
Michigan again claimed four 
of the top-eight places, with 
freshman Aurora Rynda leading 
the pack in second place.
“I think we really focused 
on getting out hard and getting 
into a good position,” Rynda 
said. “Shannon just told me ‘lets 
do it’ so I was really excited to 
push myself and see how fast I 
could go.”
After 
Rynda’s 
strong 
performance this weekend, she 
is ranked 12th in the nation, but 
the freshman isn’t settling for 
top-15. She knows she can do 

more.
“I think there’s a lot of room 
for 
improvement,” 
Rydna 
said. “I need to get stronger 
for sure. I’ve just been having 
good workouts and (assistant 
coach Mike McGuire) has been 
awesome.”
The 
women 
had 
trouble 
repeating this level of success 
in the field events. Constantly 
falling 
somewhere 
between 
fourth and ninth place, the 
Wolverines 
had 
trouble 
breaking into the top three 
spots. Weight throwing duo 
Kayla 
Deering 
and 
Bailey 
Baker finished eighth and ninth 
respectively, both finishing just 
shy of half a meter below the 
back-to-back 
school 
records 
set earlier this year at the 
Wolverine Invitational.
In contrast, the men had a 
series of strong performances 
in the field events with senior 
Andrew Liskowitz placing first 
in the shot put and sophomore 
Daniel Butael coming in second 
on the triple jump. Graduate 
student Joe Ellis, who holds the 
school record in both the weight 
and hammer throw events, 
placed second in the weight 
throw event.
This event precedes the Big 
Ten 
Indoor 
Championships 
which will be held in Ann Arbor 
later this month.

The Michigan men’s lacrosse team is adjusting to the new 80-second shot clock ahead of the upcoming season.

Wolverines vault past Buckeyes
On back of strong performances from Kevin Penev and Cameron Bock, Michigan tops Ohio State, 413.900-402.300

Kevin Penev cleanly lifted his 
arms to the roof of Cliff Keen 
Arena as he prepared to begin his 
floor routine.
The freshman’s arms dropped 
down as he leaped into a graceful 
run that transformed into laid out 
flips and twists. Penev migrated 
to 
the 
floor 
and 
supported 
countless orbital spins with only 
his muscular arms. The move 
evolved into a headstand that he 
quickly burst out of, progressing 
into his final cross. Penev casually 
finished his routine with three 
in-air full body backward twists. 
The judges flashed a 14.300. His 
floor routine tied with Ohio State’s 
Sean Neighbarger for second place 
behind senior Emyre Cole, who 
scored 14.600 for the Michigan 
men’s gymnastics team.
Penev, 
who 
was 
the 
first 
freshman to compete for the 
Wolverines this season, was a 
standout in Michigan’s 413.900 
- 402.300 triumph over the rival 
Buckeyes.
“After my floor routine, I used all 
of my energy from that to motivate 
everyone else on my team,” Penev 
said. “We beat our rival, so that was 
so exciting.”
Penev built off the momentum 
from his early success in the first 
rotation for his second and final 
event of the day, the high bar, 
which earned him a 13.000.
“I did not expect to get that 
score and it was one of the highest 
scores I’ve ever gotten,” Penev said. 
“So that was a plus for me and the 
team.”
While talking about his pre-
competition mental state, Penev 
oozed calmness. His relaxation 
juxtaposed 
with 
the 
physical 
intensity of the sport.
“Before I do any routine in any 
event, I think of doing one skill at 
a time and not rushing it and being 
patient with it and letting it go,” 
Penev said.
With a team score of 72.500 
on the vault, the six Wolverines 

who competed in the event all 
demonstrated Michigan’s gradual 
ascension this season to a national 
ranking of third place. Wolverine 
coach Kurt Golder hinted that 
Penev might be a secret weapon to 
help his team become even more 
powerful on the vault.
“We will get stronger,” Golder 
said. “By the end of the year, I 
expect 
(sophomore) 
Cameron 
(Bock) and Kevin to do those more 
difficult vaults and, like you saw, 
our top-five scores will be in that 
range, instead of just three.”
Though 
he 
fell 
while 
dismounting from the high bar, 
Cole, who competed in all six 
events, was another standout for 
Michigan. With an all-around 
score of 84.100, he placed in the top 
three on five events.
In his fourth year with the team, 
Cole has assumed a role like that 
of a mentor towards his younger 
teammates. The composure he 
exuded during his failed dismount 

set a great example for a freshman 
like Penev.
“I thought I managed it well,” 
Cole said. “If you do make a 
mistake, make sure you don’t 
make anymore. That’s something 
I yell out to the guys all the time. 
‘Perfection. Perfection.’ It was a 
little fluke, but I think I bounced 
back well.”
As a freshman, Cole, much like 
Penev, performed with unbounded 
potential. He scored an 84.950 all-
around for the Wolverines in the 
2016 Big Ten Team Finals.
Based on Saturday’s consistently 
strong 
performance, 
Cole 
complimented his teammates and 
expressed optimism for the rest of 
the season.
“These boys have been putting 
work in the gym and we look really 
good now,” Cole said. “If we can 
just transfer what’s going on in 
the gym out to the competition 
floor, we’re going to have a Big Ten 
championship on our hands.”

For the Daily

Getting sick in the middle 
of winter is never enjoyable. 
It’s even less so when you’re 
the 
College 
Gymnastics 
Association National Gymnast 
of the Week with a meet 
against your school’s biggest 
rival only days away.
This was what sophomore 
gymnast 
Cameron 
Bock 
faced 
ahead 
of 
Saturday’s 
home opener against Ohio 
State. Having won the all-
around competition against 
Minnesota on Jan. 26 with 
the country’s highest score, 
Bock had high expectations 
for his performance against 
the Buckeyes. He came into 
the meet ranked No. 3 in the 
NCAA in the all-around and as 
the two-time reigning Big Ten 
gymnast of the week.
It might have been his week 

to shine, but soon he wasn’t 
feeling that way.
“We were coming back from 
Minnesota and I was feeling 
good,” 
Bock 
said. 
“Then, 
throughout the day Monday, 
I just started deteriorating 
really quickly. I was constantly 
shaking and had a lot of 
body aches. My stomach was 
hurting. I couldn’t eat.”
In light of this, Bock’s 
performance 
on 
Saturday 
was all the more impressive. 
He walked away having won 
two individual events — the 
parallel bars and still rings — 
and earned some of the best 
scores in the country in the 
process.
Such 
a 
performance 
certainly wasn’t a guarantee. 
Bock was out of commission 
for 
most 
of 
the 
team’s 
practices throughout the week 
and his status for the meet was 
in doubt until Thursday.

“We 
didn’t 
even 
know 
if he was going to go until 
(Thursday),” said Michigan 
coach Kurt Golder. “And even 
then we were just going to 
have him in a couple of events. 
But his role just grew and 
grew and he did a great job.”
Bock’s ability to shine even 
in challenging circumstances 
speaks to a consistency that 
was on display throughout 
the meet. His score of 14.65 on 
the parallel bars is the third 
best in the country so far this 
season.
“The 
parallel 
bars 
are 
probably my favorite event,” 
Bock 
said. 
“I 
am 
pretty 
consistent at it, so it actually 
wasn’t that hard to get back 
into it after taking almost the 
whole week off.”
Bock 
also 
excelled 
on 
the still rings with a score 
of 14.50, alongside a strong 
slate of performances from 
Michigan’s other gymnasts,
Bock’s 
success 
did 
not 
extend to performance on the 
high bar, however. Midway 
through the routine, he fell off 
and was forced to restart. With 
the determined look that was 
present on his face throughout 
the meet, he chalked up his 
hands again, took a deep 
breath, and started over.
“The tension on the bar was 
not the same tension I had 
planned on,” Bock said. “It 
threw me off for the release 
that I missed.
“But, you know, you just 
have to deal with those things 
sometimes.”
Whether with his sickness 
or getting back up on the 
bar, Bock indeed seems to 
have a propensity for dealing 
with things. But asked about 
the 
strategy 
behind 
his 
recurrent success, he isn’t too 
philosophical.
“I just did my best to power 
through it,” Bock said. “I felt 
pretty good today, so I guess it 
worked.”

Steve Pikiell and the unenviable task of building Rutgers basketball

Back in October, when the Big 
Ten was a mystery and Rutgers’ 
place in it a foregone conclusion, 
Steve Pikiell sat at a round table 
near the edge of a hotel ballroom 
in Rosemont, Ill., trying and 
failing to dissuade reputation.
The Scarlet Knights, who had 
won a combined nine conference 
games in their first four Big Ten 
seasons — two of them under 
Pikiell’s tutelage — had no 
traveling reporters at Big Ten 
Media Day. Their coach had no 
choice but to project optimism 
to every stranger he came across.
“I 
don’t 
know 
what 
the 
perception 
is,” 
Pikiell 
said, 
earnestly. “I know for two years, 
we’ve been a program that has 
competed against everybody in 
this league. We went from seven 
wins before I got here to 15 and 
15. We’ve beaten teams that we 
had never beaten before in the 
conference, and I think we’re 
getting better.”
The perception, to put it 
bluntly, would be that Rutgers 
is a laughingstock — a joke of 
a program heaped onto the 
Big Ten for the sole purpose 
of TV subscriptions in the 
New York market. The Scarlet 
Knights 
haven’t 
made 
the 
NCAA Tournament since 1991, 
28 years and three conferences 
ago. In March 2016, they turned 
to Pikiell to spearhead a near-
impossible rebuilding project.
At his introductory presser, 
Pikiell said he would’ve walked 
across the New Jersey Turnpike 
to get the job.
A 51-year old Connecticut 
native who went to college near 
home and has coached in the 
tri-state area his entire career, 
Pikiell projects honesty into 
absurdity. That’s why, when he 
ends his roundtable by saying, 
“I’m excited about where we’re 
headed and hopefully that’ll help 
us get out of last place, which is 
where we’ve been for the last 
two years,” you are, too.

When he runs down a roster 
that finished 270th in adjusted 
offensive efficiency the season 
prior, you start to think his tenets 
— rebounding, defense, hard 
work and a slow, methodical 
build — might just work if given 
enough time. And when you hear 
the stories about Pikiell, you 
start to think he embodies those 
tenets.
For example, the 32 times he 
has dislocated his shoulder, if 
Jim Calhoun’s estimate is to be 
believed.
The first of those came on 
a loose ball at a Connecticut 
practice. Pikiell dove, then came 
up with his shoulder out of his 
socket. 
The 
scene 
repeated 
again and again over Pikiell’s 
four years as a player with the 
Huskies.
“You could tell he was in 
incredible pain,” Calhoun said. 
“And then every time he did it, 
we took him to the orthopods at 
UConn Medical Center, and they 
(said), we can operate, he’ll be 
out in seven months, and Steve 
wanted no part of it. He wanted 
to play the year.”
Over 
four 
years, 
as 
that 
shoulder 
kept 
subluxing, 
Calhoun started to build a 
powerhouse in Storrs. In Pikiell’s 
freshman year, which doubled 
as the coach’s first, the Huskies 
went 
9-19, 
finishing 
at 
the 
bottom of the Big East. By 1990, 
UConn was 31-6, making it to the 
Elite Eight.
“My first year was the first year 
of the Big East conference,” said 
Glen Miller, a longtime Calhoun 
assistant who coached Pikiell 
at UConn. “And a lot of people 
didn’t think UConn belonged in 
the Big East conference.”
Sound familiar?
Pikiell’s task is larger, more 
daunting 
than 
his 
mentor’s. 
The rebuild he undertook over 
11 years at Stony Brook before 
getting the Seawolves to the 
NCAA Tournament in 2016 pales 
in comparison. The identity that 
Rutgers has unwittingly built in 
the last 30 years makes it so as 

much as any of its more recent 
history.
To make the Scarlet Knights 
relevant, Pikiell has to convince 
recruits that the Scarlet Knights 
can be relevant — a particularly 
hard task when they have not 
been so since the coach was 
still in school. He has to do that 
in a talent-rich state where the 
talent wants to be anywhere but 
Piscataway. And he has to do it 
while competing against a league 
that, as Pikiell dutifully noted on 
Big Ten Media Day, might be the 
best in America.
That 
doesn’t 
just 
mean 
Rutgers getting better, it means 
a couple other programs falling 
by the wayside. Sum it all up, 
and the task in front of Pikiell is, 
well, intimidating.
There is room for optimism, 

if 
notching 
a 
three-game 
conference win streak for the 
first time since the Scarlet 
Knights joined the Big Ten 
counts as such. When Michigan 
comes to town on Tuesday, 
Rutgers will have a chance to win 
its fifth conference game for the 
first time since joining for 2014-
15 season. That’s progress, even 
if progress is measured like the 
success of a row boat paddling 
upstream.
“They’re 
gonna 
have 
bad 
days, trust me,” Calhoun said. 
“Because I went through three 
or four years before we got to a 
significant place in the Big East. 
But I just think people — the 
biggest thing I think watching 
his teams play and watching him 
work, I think people realize they 
got a guy on the job 24/7. And a 

guy who’s motivated his kids to 
be really good. No one says — if 
it’s going to be easy, no one would 
ever get fired.”
Pikiell, after signing a three-
year extension last January, is 
likely in no danger of losing his 
job. When the UConn job came 
open last year, his close ties to the 
Huskies were seen as more likely 
to end his tenure in Piscataway 
than 
anything 
performance-
based.
It would be wrong to say 
success 
has 
eluded 
Pikiell. 
Whether the timetable to achieve 
success will mean the clock ticks 
out before he does so remains to 
be seen.
“How I measure success is the 
goal I had two years ago. Go to the 
NCAA Tournament, that’s how I 
measure success,” Pikiell said in 

October. “I look at what we’ve 
done in two years and we’ve 
improved in every area. I believe 
that. And we’re building new 
practice facilities, almost done, 
nine months away. We put down 
a new court. Like I said, season 
tickets are up. Enthusiasm in our 
program’s up. Recruiting up. Our 
players getting better is up.
“We play in the toughest 
league in the country. So, to get 
to the NCAA Tournament is not 
easy. We gotta do a lotta things to 
do that. I know where everyone 
picks us. Until we get out of that 
position, that’s where they’re 
gonna pick us. But I think we’re 
pretty good.”
Right now, and for the slow 
build still to come, he’ll be given 
every chance to prove those 
words true.

Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell is optimistic despite facing a long rebuilding project for the Scarlet Knights, who have not made the NCAA Tournament in 28 years.

For the seniors, there and back again

Joseph Cecconi and Brendan 
Warren sat silently and thought 
for a moment.
Three years removed from 
their first trip to New York, the 
seniors could barely remember 
how the game in Madison 
Square Garden went during 
their first collegiate season.
“I don’t remember the game 
at all,” Cecconi said, laughing. 
“But if I had to take a snap at it, 
we were down a few goals and 
then we threw out the CCM 
line, and then we came back, so 
I’m going to go with that.”
He 
wasn’t 
wrong. 
The 
CCM line — consisting of JT 
Compher, Kyle Connor and 
Tyler Motte — accounted for 
five total points, scoring three 
goals and two assists. Two of 
the goals were part of a third-
period comeback during a 6-3 
win.
But the game itself was the 
least memorable part of the 
trip. They were two freshmen 
with the city that never sleeps 
at the palm of their hands. And 
for Warren, it was his first 
time.
“That was a really cool 
experience,” Warren said. “I’ve 
never been to the city, or at 
least Madison Square Garden, 
around there, so it was cool 
being with the team.
“Got a little bit of time 
sightseeing, and we played 
in MSG, which is obviously 
iconic and historic and we 
got to watch the basketball 
game before that, and that was 
really cool. It was a really fun 
experience.”
With a little bit of time 
on their hands, they walked 
eight blocks north, venturing 
through Times Square on their 
way to the arena to watch the 
basketball 
game 
preceding 
theirs — before Michigan faced 
off against Penn State on the ice, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team tipped off against Penn 
State on the hardwood. For 
the 
two 
freshmen, 
playing 
at Madison Square Garden 
fulfilled a lifelong dream.
“It was fun. Up until then, I 

don’t think I’ve played a game 
in an NHL rink,” Cecconi said. 
“Except if we did the ‘Duel 
in the D’ or the Great Lakes 
Invitational so I guess I did, 
but it’s always fun to play in 
an NHL rink because it’s your 
dream one day to play in rinks 
like that. So when you can do it 
in college, just a fun different 
experience 
than 
a 
college 
atmosphere.”
The excitement wasn’t all 
in the sightseeing, the city 
exploration or even the game 
itself. As Cecconi noted, once 
you start playing, you don’t 
“remember how many fans 
were there, or how long the 
goal horns are.” What stood out 
to him was the build up.
“Everything 
is 
there 
(at 
Madison 
Square 
Garden): 
basketball, hockey, concerts. 
Everyone 
knows 
Madison 
Square Garden for all the sports 
and all the music festivals and 
things like that, so just the 
hype around New York City and 
Madison Square Garden, that’s 
what I remember the most.”
Fast forward three years 
— an eventful three years 
that encompassed a Big Ten 
Tournament 
championship 
and a Frozen Four appearance 
— and Cecconi had a chance 
to relive the hype. Three years 
ago, 
they 
were 
wide-eyed 
freshmen looking to tour the 
city. Ten days ago, they were 
focused seniors who already 
experienced some incredible 
memories.

The team arrived in the city 
on the afternoon of Jan. 25. 
With no practice, everyone had 
downtime to do whatever they 
wanted.
“We got to do a lot more 
sightseeing,” 
Warren 
said. 
“First day we got there, we 
got there early. We walked 
around Times Square, went 
into a bunch of stores. And then 
walked around 5th Ave., went 
to some of the designer stores 
just to see some of the stuff we 
can’t afford.”
Only a few hours were to 
themselves, though, as the 
team got together for a team 
meal at Carmine’s and then left 
for the hotel. Just like they did 
three years ago, Cecconi and 
Warren were able to take in the 
mystique of the city that never 
sleeps.
But while Michigan had a 
fantastic Friday once again, the 
team to have a super Saturday 
was the one hailing from State 
College. The Wolverines once 
again fell to an early deficit 
against Penn State, but with 
no CCM line to stage a rescue, 
Michigan ultimately lost 5-2.
“On the ice, not the outcome 
we 
wanted,” 
Warren 
said. 
“Probably worse than freshman 
year because we won the first 
one.”
Win or loss, the experience 
the two had was something 
that 
resonated 
with 
them 
through their collegiate career. 
As much as it was for hockey, it 
was for much more.

Depth key to Michigan’s success

Friday 
afternoon 
it 
was 
Akienreh Johnson and Kayla 
Robbins. On Sunday, it was Naz 
Hillmon. The common thread: two 
wins, two strong performances 
from the Wolverines’ bench.
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
season, much of the conversation 
surrounding a revamped Michigan 
women’s basketball squad centered 
around its depth, which looked 
to be one of this team’s greatest 
strengths. That notion has been 
supported a number of times this 
season, but especially of late.
Prior 
to 
Friday’s 
matchup 
with No. 13 Iowa, Michigan had 
lost consecutive games and sat 
in tenth in the Big Ten with their 
tournament hopes teetering on the 
brink. Additionally, senior guard 
Nicole Munger hadn’t practiced 
that week due to an ankle injury 
— despite eventually playing 35 
minutes against the Hawkeyes. All 
signs pointed to the Wolverines 
dropping their third in a row.
Thanks in large part to bench 
players like Johnson and Robbins, 
the Wolverines didn’t. Instead, 
on the back of a combined 32 
points and 15 rebounds from the 
junior guard and junior forward 
respectively, they won. Hillmon, 
too, chipped in eight points.
“Munger and Hallie (Thome) 
were a little beat up so they haven’t 
been practicing as much as the rest 
of us,” Johnson said. “That means 

players like me, Naz and Kayla 
had to step up a lot in practice. So I 
think their absence made us grow 
more because we’re like, ‘If they 
can’t play then they expect us to 
play better.’ ”
In 
a 
quick 
turnaround, 
Michigan traveled to Madison the 
next day to take on Wisconsin on 
Sunday. Despite the Badgers’ .500 
record, the Wolverines’ struggles 
away from Crisler Center this 
season suggested the game would 
be anything but straightforward.
The inclination was correct, 
but Michigan still came away 
with its first Big Ten road win of 
the season. Once again, some of 
the best performances of the day 
came from the Wolverines’ bench. 
Hillmon scored a team-high 20 
points, while Robbins posted a 
solid stat line, with six points, four 
rebounds and two blocks in just 16 
minutes.
“I think our bench has proven 
itself all year long,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico after the 
game. “We were really confident 
that Kayla and Naz could really 
help us today.”
The games against Iowa and 
Wisconsin are just the latest 
examples of how important the 
Wolverines’ depth has been in 
their success this season. Though 
Michigan has extended its rotation 
when necessary, the usual three-
deep rotation of Hillmon, Johnson 
and Robbins has come up big 
during some inconsistent spells 
from starters.

The Wolverines likely wouldn’t 
have picked up wins against 
Washington 
and 
Ohio 
State 
earlier this year if it weren’t for the 
play of their bench. Against the 
Huskies, Hillmon, Robbins and 
Johnson combined for 21 points 
and 16 rebounds — including six 
on the offensive glass — while both 
sophomore guard Deja Church and 
sophomore forward Hailey Brown 
went scoreless. In the four-point 
victory against the Buckeyes, when 
the starters shot 37-percent from 
the field, Hillmon finished with 20 
points and eight rebounds — one of 
her six 20-plus performances this 
season.
In terms of scoring, no one 
player has carried the load for 
Michigan this season. Thome 
leads the team, averaging just 12.9 
points per game. Right behind 
her is Hillmon with 12.7. The 
Wolverines’ balance and depth 
are some of their greatest assets. 
On any given night, anybody can 
shoulder the offensive burden.
It should go without saying, 
though, 
that 
Michigan’s 
best 
chance for success in the last seven 
games of the season comes when 
the starters and bench excel in 
tandem.
“If we have two or more players 
playing exceptionally well off the 
bench and our starters are on their 
game, we’re a tough team to beat,” 
Barnes Arico said.
In the meantime though, the 
Wolverines’ bench play has helped 
get their season back on track.
