After controversy
surrounding Morris
incident, students
call for AD's firing
By ALEXA DETTELBACH,.
GREG GARNO, SAM

RACHEL PREMACE
Michigan Daily Editors
The outcry calling for the fir-
ing of Michigan Athletic birec =
tor Dave Brandon has grown to
possibly its largest in his tenure
at the University after football
coach Brady Hoke's handling of
sophomore quarterback Shane
Morris' "probable, mild concus-
sion" Saturday.
There's been frustration
over his decision to exclude the
marching band from traveling
to Dallas when the Wolverines
played Alabama. And his role in
allowing the student section to
switch to a general admission
policy. There's also his decision
to approve sky writing over East
Lansing and raising ticket prices
not just for students, but also for

other fans.
Students have criticized his
department's increasingly more
expensive student ticket rates.
Last year, the ticket prices were
$40 per game, the second highest
in college football, justbehind the
University of Oregon.
In April, the University was
criticized for how officials han-
dled the permanent separation
of former Michigan kicker Bren-
dan Gibbons after he was found
responsible for violating the Uni-
versity's Student Sexual Miscon-
duct Policy.
To many, it seems, the incident
Saturday was the last straw.
Nearly 1,000 protesters call-
ing for the Brandon's termination
gathered Tuesday on University
President Mark Schlissel's front
lawn. Amid chants of "Fire Bran-
don" and "Down with Dave," one
student asked, "What power do
we have here?"
The process of making a per-
sonnel change, whether it hap-
pens or not, rests solely upon the
University's president.

DPSS reveals

By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Division
of Public Safety and Security
released its Annual Security
Report and Annual Fire Safe-
ty Report for the 2014-15 year
Tuesday.
The report details crime
trends ranging from sexual
assault, murder and larceny
to alcohol and drug viola-
tions for 2011, 2012 and 2013.
The report also informs stu-.
dents of a survivor's rights

tacts, including a cutout card
of important phone numbers
that can be kept in a wallet.
DPSS prepared the report

with the Ann Arbor Police

of Student Life, Univer-
sity Housing, the Office of
Institutional Equity and the
Office of Conflict Resolution.
Reports made about sexual

occurred in residence halls.
However, that is down from
the 12 that occurred in-res-

Dozens of students gathered
on the Diag Wednesday after-
noon to show solidarity with
pro-democracy protesters in
Hong Kong.
The silent rally was one of
over 50 on college campuses
around the United States. The
group is part of the global move-
ment to raise awareness of the
protests in Hong Kong, "United
for Democracy: Global Solidarity
for Hong Kong," which started
at Harvard University. Rackham
student Anthony Ip and LSA
junior Chris Cheung created the
University's chapter, also taking
charge of organizing and publi-
cizing the protest.
Tension has been growing in
Hong Kong since China decid-
ed not to give Hong Kong full
autonomy in 2017, as the country
promised it would back in 1997
as part of an agreement to reas-
sume sovereignty over the island
from the United Kingdom. On
Sunday, protests escalated after
clashes with police officers using
tear gas and pepper spray result-
ed in 41 injuries.
Louisa Lim, a visiting profes-
sor of journalism at the Univer-
sity, wrote an op-ed for the New
York Times Monday compar-
ing the protests to the massacre
in Tiananmen Square in 1989,
where the Chinese army was
also deployed and used violence
toward protesters. She added
that the tension stems from not
just gaining autonomy, but from
the "gaping inequality" in the
region, said to be rigged by gov-
ernment policies.
"As students and activists
faced off with riot police amid
the canyons of skyscrapers, one

"Right now what we have right
now we feel is adequate, and if
for any reason it isn't then we will
work with the Dean of Students
office to find temporary housing."
Many residential hall advis-
ers have been adjusting to the
lessened ability to room swap
by placing greater emphasis on
conflict resolution with room-
mates. According to LSA junior
Zelin Wang, residential adviser
in Stockwell Residence Hall, the
residential staff are trained to
try to resolve roommate compli-
cations through communication
before offering the option of
permanent or temporary reloca-
tion.
"In the past when there were

SCHLISSEL
From Page 1A
Daily, Regent Kathy White (D),
chair of the University's Board
of Regents, said the University's
president has direct responsibil-
ity over personnel decisions, not
the regents.
"It is the President who has
direct responsibility over the uni-
versity's operations, departments,
and personnel," she wrote.
The governing body's only
direct responsibility with per-
sonnel is selecting and evaluat-
ing the University's president.
The regents appointed Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel last
January after a lengthy search
process.
White said the University's
president is tasked with managing
the institution's daily operations,
whereas regents act as fiduciaries
that set and approve policies for
the institution as well as direct
and approve major expenditures,
financial management and large-
scale initiatives.
Though the final decision to
terminate a high-level official is
not under the board's jurisdiction,
it does approve administrative
appointments to many high-level
leadership positions, as -well as
tenure-track faculty, within the
University. At their meeting last
April, the regents approved the
University's recommendation to
appoint Andrew Martin to the
position of LSA dean.
It's still possible that Schlis-
sel could solicit counsel from
members of the board. Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said Schlissel can consult with
the board on any issue and has
already indicated he intends to
involve the regents in a review
of the University's safety pro-
cedures related to student-ath-
letes.
The regents are also respon-
sible for completing an annual
evaluation of the University
President, which could include
consideration of the president's
handling of personnel matters.
Fitzgerald said he has "no
information" as to whether any
personnel changes related to the
incident are being considered.

Schlissel released a statement
Tuesday evening calling for a
review of safety procedures relat-
ed to student-athletes and pledg-
ing to "take all necessary steps
to make sure that occurs and to
enforce the necessary account-
ability for our success in this
regard."
Contract agreements
Though Hoke took much of
the initial heat after Saturday's

mates," Wang said. "Since we've
become so tightly packed, we
can't really do that."
Business junior Michael Zhou,
who is also a residential adviser
in Stockwell-Residence Hall, said
because of the extensive training
the residential staff goes through
to deal with all possible conflicts
that could arise in residence halls,
many roommate disputes are
resolved within the halls them-
selves.
Logan said that it is up to the
hall director's discretion for
whether or not a student needs to
be separated from their room or
roommates and into emergency
housing.
Though Logan emphasized
that over-enrollment has not
impacted the lack of emergency
housing and has not created any
difficulties in replacing rooms
at this time, many University
administrators have announced
concerns over the unusually high

freshman class.'
At the University's Board of
Regents meeting this month,
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack announced her plan to curb
over-enrollment for future fresh-
man classes, such as putting more
applicants on the waitlist and
admitting fewer students during
the early admissions process.
"We have been over-enrolling
every year for the past five years
and we have to stop this," Pollack
said. "I'm not happy about it."
E. Royster Harper, vice
president for student life, also
remarked on the importance of
having enough space for first-year
students for creating a commu-
nity on campus.
"We have to watch it more
closely, and that means modulat-
ing who gets admitted longer,"
she said. "That's not going to feel
good to the incoming freshman
students, but it will allow us to
manage it better."

incident, subsequent uproar has
been focused on Brandon. Some
observers have alleged the Ath-
letic Department was not trans-
parent in its communications
with the public following the con-
troversy and have chosen to call
for his termination.
Brandon's 2012 contract exten-
sion details grounds for the agree-
ment's termination, both "with
cause by University" and without.
The document, signed by for-
mer University President Mary
Sue Coleman, stipulates Bran-
don's term will last through June
30, 2018 with the potential for an
additional, five-year term "upon
mutual agreement of University
and Director."
Grounds for "termination with
cause" includes the director's fail-
ure to "perform in any material
respect any of his duties or obliga-
tions under this Agreement," con-
viction for felony or misdemeanor
charges involving financial or
moral impropriety or for inten-
tional or major violations of any
NCAA conference or University
rule or regulation.
Brandon's contract could
also be terminated with cause
through the broader category that
the "conduct of the Director that
offends against public decency or
morality as shall be determined
by the standards prevailing in the
community, or any other conduct
by the Director that materially
and adversely affects the reputa-
tion or the assets of the University
or one or more of its athletic pro-
grams."
If terminated for these rea-
sons or if the director resigns, he
would receive any unpaid base
salary through the date of termi-
nation.
However, if the University fires
Brandon prior to July1, 2016with-
out providing sufficient evidence
for cause, he would be guaranteed
payment of his remaining base
salary and remaining deferred
compensation of $3 million
through the date of his termina-
tion.
Brandon currently earns abase
salary of $900,000, but that num-
ber is slated to reach $1.05 million
in the final year of his contract.
Michael Bloom is a clinical
assistant professor of law at the
University and in charge of the
Law School's Transactional Lab.
He said morality clauses are com-
mon in sports contracts, whether
with players, coaches or sponsor-
ship agreements.
"It's something that gener-
ally would say that the employer
can terminate the contract in the
event that the employee engages
in immoral behavior," Bloom said.
"It might explain what immoral
behavior means or stay broad and

not get into the details."
One prominent example of the
usage of morality clauses is golfer
Tiger Woods. His 2009 infidelity
scandal led to several companies
terminating sponsorship deals.
The BBC reported in 2010 the ter-
mination was estimated to cost
all parties involved in the Woods
scandal around $12 billion.
Hoke's contract also has a
morality clause, which states
he can be fired for cause if he
"offends public decency or moral-
ity shall be determined by the
standards prevailing in the com-
munity."
Termination without cause
means the Athletic Department
would be required to pay Hoke $3
million, accordingto the contract.
And termination with cause,
which the morality clause allows,
stipulates "all obligations of the
University to make further pay-
ments and/or provide any other
consideration under this Agree-
ment ... shall cease as of the date
of termination."
The Rich Rod case
At the University, there is
recent precedent for terminat-
ing the contract of a head football
coach.
Jan. 4, 2011, a recently hired
Brandon terminated Rich Rodri-
guez as the head coach of the
Michigan football team.
After Rodriguez finished the
2010 season with a 7-6 record,
including a 52-14 loss in the Gator
Bowl to Mississippi State, he
ended his tenure in Ann Arbor
with a 15-22 record. Most glar-
ing of all, he never beat Michigan
State or Ohio State.
In what could similarly tran-
spire if the University terminates
Brady Hoke's contract, Michi-
gan made the decision to buy out
Rodriguez's remaining three-
year, $2.5-million contract. But
the University's reasons for doing
so extended beyond the team's
performance on the field. The
NCAA punished the University
for practice times that exceeded
the NCAA's weekly allotment.
Rodriguez was also caught lying
about his team's GPA after saying
it was the highest in program his-
tory.
A problem to be solved
Brandon and Hoke apparently
contradicted each other in a press
conference Monday afternoon
and a statement early Tuesday
morning.
Now, it's up to a president with
little experience in Big Ten ath-
letics since arriving to the Uni-
versity from Brown University in
July. His largest decision thus far
rests in his own hands.

REPORT
From Page 3A
one was arrested.
Regarding drug use in and
around campus, the report
listed 114 arrests on campus,
three off-campus and 48 on
public property. There were
30 arrests for drugs within the
residence halls. The report did
not differentiate between the

types of drug being used.
There were far more cases
of drug use in which the vio-
lators were referred for dis-
ciplinary action -153 -all of
which were on campus.
DPSS must also report the
number of "Bias Crimes,"
which are incidents that
"manifest evidence of preju-
dice based on race, religion,
sexual orientation, gender,
disability or ethnicity." Over

Design by Anjai Alangaden and Jake Welins
the past' three years, there
was one UMPD report of on-
campus vandalism with a sex-
ual orientation bias, and one
for religious bias. The AAPD
reported one non-aggravated
assault with a sexual orienta-
tion bias.
In 2012 and 2011 there were
eight separate crimes both
years.
The full report is available
on the DPSS website.


RENOVATIONS
From Page 1A
identified as one of the residen-
tial halls that required revamp-
ing. When making plans for the
renovation, housing officials
interviewed students to hear
what they wanted to see in their
new dining center and common
areas.
After approval from the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents, con-
struction commenced in May
2013 and was completed prior to
the Fall 2014 move-in date.
With the renovations com-
plete, the dining facility now
includes 10 specialty 'micro-
restaurants,' each with its own
distinct style. Some of these res-
taurants include Olive Branch,
which is inspired by fresh Medi-
terranean flavors, Toast, which
serves breakfast all day and
Smoke, which offers traditional
wood-smoked barbecue.
Schlissel said he was so blown
away with the building's new
architecture that he insisted on
bringing his family on a tour of
South Quad when they were here
in September for his inaugura-
tion.
"I snuck them in here to tour
around and make them all jeal-
ous of Michigan," Schlissel said.
"None of them went here for
school, and they all used to be
very prideful of the dining facili-
ties where they did go to school.
But we win."
However, Schlissel did men-

tion that the new dining hall was
so popular that the entryways
were facing overcrowding dur-
ing busy lunch hours.
"But they'll work on solutions
for that," Schissel said. "There
are so many stations of food, that
once you actually get inside, it's
pretty quick and easy."
As per student requests, many
of the restaurants specialize in
personalized meals. Students
have the option to special-order
a stir-fry and watch as their chef
cooks their ingredients in front
of them.
University Housing Spokes-
man Peter Logan said, after
reading student responses, it
was clear that there was a high
demand for fresh ingredients
and made-to-order selections.
"We have a new kitchen downt
in the basement, and the food is
initially prepared down there,
but it is not finished until it is
brought upstairs ... in front of the
students," Logan said.
While the dining hall was the
main focus of South Quad's reno-
vation, the common areas on the
lower level were also redone.
While guests enjoyed appetizers
on the main floor, dozens of stu-
dents occupied the study spaces
downstairs.
LSA freshman Nand Desai
said South Quad was his study
spot of choice, even though he
lives in Bursley Residence Hall
on North Campus.
"I come here and spend time
because it is the best location
on campus for studying, and I

love the food here," Desai said.
"It's, like, the best dining hall on
campus. You have ten different
options to choose from everyday.
And it is open all day. If I have a
break I always come here."
The dining center's staff also
seemed to be pleased with the
renovation's final product. Din-
ing Employee Yolanda Douglas,
who has previously worked at
Mary Markley Residence Hall
and West Quad, said the South
Quad facility is her favorite.
"I love it. This is a wonder-
ful place," Douglas said. "I love
all the recipes; the food is very
exquisite. It is just beautiful. And
we have units and dining areas
for everybody - for quiet people,
for not quiet people. We got fla-
vorshere for everyone. And I
love it because we can see all the
multicultural people here."
Director of Dining Steven
Mangan said he was extremely
satisfied with South Quad's din-
ing hall. While you can find
micro-restaurants at East Quad's
dining center as well, South
Quad is much larger and offers
students many more options for
seating.
"This is the nicest dining hall
I've ever been associated with,"
Mangan said. "It really is a
focus on food, costumer service,
fun, interaction with our staff,
learning about food and tasting
things you've never seen before.
Options are unlimited from
where we are today, and it will
be greatto see it evolve into what
it is going tobe."


DOWNLOADING
From Page 1A
copyrighted material such as
music,videos, art or books.
Levy said the issue is predomi-
nantlywithstudentsinadvertently
downloading copyrighted mate-
rial from unauthorized sources
and then sharing those files with
peers. He said a basic rule of
thumb is to remember that if the
file being shared is not specifically
identified as publically available,
the safest thing to do is assume
it is copyrighted and investigate
further before sharing. The Uni-
versity is alerted to the unauthor-
ized download and will punish
students once the files are shared.
Another issue with file shar-
ing sites is that they compromise
computer security. A problem
with P2P programs is that they
may start up when the computer
is turned on and accessing the
Internet without the user's knowl-
edge, Levy said. He said this could

potentially allow other people
to access files from a vulnerable
computer without any warning or
consent, which can lead to unin-
tentional copyright infringement.
University Internet policy
states that users are respon-
sible for file sharing activities of
their computer, even if they are
unaware of the activity. There-
fore, Levy said the safest thing
to do is to encourage students to
be aware of the contents of their
computers so they can avoid
legal issues.
The University has a tiered
punishment process for students
based on the number of copyright
infringement complaints a student
receives. The first alleged offence
results in a notice to cease illegal
activity, the final offence results
in a formal complaint being filed
with the Office of Student Con-
flict Resolution. Copyright holders
may also offer a Pre-litigation Set-
tlement Offer, which would allow
the violator to paya fee in order to
avoid being sued by the copyright

holder.
Levy said it was important for
students to be proactive and take
this issue seriously.
"It is important to understand,
U of M students have had to deal
with the negative results of copy-
right infringement," he said. "It is
not something that happens (else-
where), it happens here."
Levy said Wednesday's e-mail
was not in response to any spe-
cific event or even an uptick in
illegal activity. Rather, the pur-
pose of the e-mail sent out was to
educate students on the risks of
P2P file sharing, and emphasize
the importance of taking it seri-
ously. There are alternatives to
illegal file sharing that are effec-
tive and allowed, Levy said, and
violating copyright laws is the
equivalent of theft of another
person's intellectual property.
"In a University like ours," he
said, "respect for the intellectual
property that has been created
by other people is a very impor-
tant fundamental value."


BUDGET
From Page 2A
"At Festifall LSA SG mem-
bers, myself included, went
around to as many organiza-
tions as possible to pass out fly-
ers educating them about our
funding system and upcoming
deadlines," Dabrowski said.
"We also contact all organi-

zations that have regularly
applied for funding for their
events, and also one-time appli-
cants."
LSA SG has also begun to use
social media and other online
outlets to better inform student
orgs about the funding switch,
hoping to be able to get in touch
with even more student organi-
zations on campus.
"This year we plan to go
through Maize Pages to contact

even more organizations to get
the word out about LSA SG' s
Budget Allocations process. We
will also be doing a social media
push and are hoping to get the
word out through other offices
and organizations on campus."
Overall, LSA SG members
said they are hopeful that the
changes to the budget alloca-
tions funding plan will encour-
age more student organizations
to apply for funding this year.

A cohesive strategy
White House must provide tangible actions against sexual assault
n January President Barack Obama and his administration
J yformed a task force to discuss issues surrounding sexual
assault prevention and awareness. The task force, Not Alone,
published its recommendations and results in April. Subsequently,
Sept.19, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden publicly launched the
"It's On Us" campaign - an effort geared primarily toward raising
awareness of sexual assault on college campuses and encouraging
us, the students, to stop these crimes from occurring. While the
campaign is admirable in its creation, the White House must provide
students with tangible solutions, such as the Bipartisan Campus
Accountability and Safety Act, in order to actually initiate change.

bills. Her efforts have successfully
raised over $2,000. Meanwhile, it is
these encounters with animals like
Faith to which Haugen attributes
her education in selflessness,
compassion and empathy.
The product of Haugen's
experience was undeniable during
ourmeeting:agloballyandculturally
enriched young woman who
unquestionably challenged herself
on all accounts, and fully capitalized
on the educational opportunities
thatthis Universityis able toprovide
its students.
"I realized nothing is going
to be handed to* me," Haugen
said. "At a big university - you
can get lost in it. There are great
opportunities here but you
have to go out and make these
things happen."
It is this student initiative, but

also an understanding of the com-
plexity of the system, that I fear
many students may lack - thank-
fully, Haugen doesn't. Her experi-
ences abroad also contributed in
part to her decision to found the
University's chapter of The Stu-
dent Animals and Society Institute
- going by the acronym 'SASI'.
While Haugen explains that the
first two years of SASI were admit-
tedly difficult, even somewhat dis-
heartening, she now hasa renewed
faith in the young person's percep-
tion and understanding of wildlife
conservation. She assured me that
our generation isn't necessarily
ignorant, per se, but most do not
realize that there is an entire field
of study dedicated to conserva-
tion that exists - a field of study
entirely intertwined both environ-
mental studies and sustainability

as a whole.
Haugen's positivity and opti-
mism are enchanting, if not infec-
tious. More so than ever before,
Haugen feels confident that the
University is acknowledging the
leverage and importance of sus-
tainability, and bringing it to the
forefront of worthwhile conversa-
tions. She looked over the table at
me sincerely - as did Tonka - con-
vincing me of her unfailing com-
mitment to communicating her
global experience back to the stu-
dents in Ann Arbor, hoping at the
very least, to inspire younger stu-
dents to capitalize on the personal-
ly and educationally revolutionary
opportunities that this institution
can afford - if only you seek them.

Through partnerships that include the Big
Ten conference and NCAA, the "It's On Us"
campaign advances into everyday campus life,
infiltrating Facebook and becoming readily
accessible to students across the nation. With
500 million users on Facebook alone, social
media is a popular avenue through which many
activist campaigns reach the public. According
to a study done by Burson-Marsteller, a global
publicrelations and communicationsfirm,33out
of 34 political advocacy groups use social media
as a platform for change.
The executive branch is admirable in its
attempt to create cultural change on college
campuses through a web-based public service
campaign. However, it will not be effective on
its own. The "It's On Us" campaign has been an
informational movement thus far, but refrains
from calling for any specific action. In order
for social campaigns to work and for some sort
of action to be initiated, a call to rise must be
visibly present to the audience. This step is vital
in transitioning the "It's On Us" movement from
the Internet to college campuses.
The University has officially joined Obama's
campaign to start the conversation about sexual
assault in our community, along with nearly
200 other colleges across the country. This
past summer our Central Student Government
was invited to join the initiative and has been
working in great strides to spread the word by
working with various student organizations,
suchas IWill, astudent-runcampaign dedicated
to preventing sexual assault, the Student-
Athlete Advisory Committee, the University's
chapter of the National PanHellenic council,
LSA Student Government and the Education
Theatre Company. The "It's On Us" campaign
has made its way to Ann Arbor and has started
what hopefully becomes a revolution, but leaves
the question of what more can we do.
July 30, eight U.S. Senators proposed one of
many solutions by unveiling a bipartisan bill to
address the problem of sexual assault in colleges
and universities. The bill, called the Bipartisan
Campus Accountability and Safety Act, aims
to more effectively enforce the handling and
prevention of sexual assault on campuses.
With "It's On Us" in full swing, voters must
urge their senators to act on the bill as soon as
possible in order to further ensure safety on
college campuses.
This Bipartisan Campus and Accountability

Safety Act requires colleges to designate
Confidential Advisors who will coordinate
support services and resources to survivors,
ensure minimum training standards for
on-campus personnel, follow a single
disciplinary process to be used by the entire
school and increase coordination with local
law enforcement.
The bill will also create a standardized,
anonymous survey to be conducted annually.
These surveys will be published online and
available to the general public. Though these
data collection practices havebeen criticized for
being biased, the goal of the surveys is to gauge
the actual prevalence of sexual assaultinstead of
just the officially reported number of incidents.
This particular stipulation in the bill will
finally provide basic metrics to how well a
school is handling sexual assault on campus.
The anonymity may also encourage more
survivors to come forward. According to the
report published by Not Alone, "only 2 percent
of incapacitated sexual assault survivors and
13 percent of forcible rape survivors report the
crime to campus or local law enforcement."Both
the anonymity and the greater transparency
of the surveys will hopefully alleviate this
startlinglylowreportrate.
A final stipulation in the bill will create
stiffer penalties for violations of both Title
IX amd the Clery Act. Title IX establishes
penalties for discrimination based on sex
in federally funded colleges while the Clery
Act requires schools to keep and disclose all
information about crime on or near campuses.
Under the Bipartisan Campus Accountability
Safety Act, schools who violate the act may
suffer a fine of up to1 percent of their operating
budget. Similarly, penalties for the Clery Act
will increase from $35,000 to $150,000 for
each violation.
Previously, schools found to be in violation
of the law were at risk of losing federal funding
entirely, though no school has been issued this
penaltyyet. Totallyrevoking all federalfunding
from a school isn't a realistic punishment, and
the lack of any lesser punishment for schools
makes for an ineffective deterrent. The
penalties brought forth by this bill therefore act
as a potentially more effective intermediary.
This softer penalty may be enforced more
frequently, incentivizing schools to better
handle incidents of sexual assault.

Writing anything anti-foot-
ballwon'tmakeme many
friendsinthese parts.But
with all our guns locked and loaded
on a greedy athletic director and his
inept department as of late, I thought
Iwould focus mine elsewhere.
Yes, the coachingand medical staff
madeanerroronSaturday.Sophomore
quarterback Shane Morris needed
to have been indefinitely sidelined
after he suffered a violent blow to
the head and came up wobbly with
concussion-like symptoms. But who
are we kidding? Football is inherently
a violent sport, a hotbed of gung-ho
testosterone and drunken aggression.
Debilitated brains and bodies have
always and will continue to always be
its inconvenient byproduct.
Just two weeks ago, the NFL itself
was forced to concede, after years of
litigation, that 28 percent of retired
players develop long-term cognitive
problems that manifest "notably"
earlier than in the general public.
(Yes, that's over one in four players
withseverebraininjuries.)Howmany
studies are necessary before it's clear
that slamming 250-pound men into
one another can't be good for them?
Blaming Michigan coach Brady

Dave Brandon for not protecting Mor-
ris is as ridiculous asblamingMuham-
mad Ali's coach, Joe Martin, for Ali's
current vegetative state. The problem
is systemic,notindividualistic.Atleast

Imagine for a moment that
Michigan football was not off to its
worststart ever. Imagine that we won
on Saturday, and are 5-0 so far and

that murmurs are already brewing
thatwecanwinthe Rose Bowl.Ohthe
glory!! Now, imagine that the whole
Shane Morris incident played out the
exact same way.Inthis counterfactual
history, tell me honestly: Would
your athletic department vitriol be
as cutthroat? Would there still be
shouts (first from this newspaper) to
fire Hoke, a 10,000-signature-and-
still-growing petition to fire Brandon
and impassioned protests before the
president's house - and risk wrecking
alegendary season?
No, there's just no way.
Morris's concussion is the perfect
ploy, player safety the dishonest front
for fans to hide behind, claim moral
superiority from Brandon and his
businesscronies, and hopefully,ifthey
scream loud enough, get what they
really want:those Ws.
Because winning comes first in
this city, and everything else second.
Michigan fans expect nothing less.
How else could it be true that the
"medical and coaching staffs did
not see the hit," as Brandon wrote
in his statement that reads, if you
know anything about Brandon, as a
crafty and failed attempt to quell a
PR nightmare. You're going to have
me believe that not one of the maybe
30-person medical and coachingstaff
on the field saw the hit? Dave, you're
going to have to do better than that.
The staff didn't want to see the hit.
Morris was the team's last hope. And
if the fans were right now riding a
winningwave and not apaing one, I
bet the outcry would have been much
more muted.
The die-hard fans will scream

that I'm not a Wolverine, that I'm
spurning Michigan's deep football
tradition. So be it. Some traditions
are just outdated.
I know that's not realistic, though.
There are too many students and
alumni that live to their bone marrow
for Michiganfootball.

It's about time we got our priorities

clearly capable of organizing quickly

. am currently enrolled in an Eng-
lish class where we consistently
discuss literature and social
change. A piece
of literature that
was recently dis-
cussed was Rita
Mae Brown's
"Rubyfruit
Jungle" (1973),
and while read-
ing, my class-
mates and I SIERRA
were asked to BROWN
keep in mind the
stereotypes pre-
sented throughout the novel. We ran
into stereotypes such as these: "Only
boys can be doctors ... All girls look
like that ... Lesbians look like men
and are ugly ... Lesbians are boyish
and athletic." These and many other
stereotypes in the book surround
the idea that individuals should take
on a certain role in society and look
a certain way. I've always wondered
what gave people the right, and the
nerve, to assign "roles" that say how
others should act or whattheyshould
look like. What happens when people
don't play their "roles" properly? But
who makes these rules anyway?
Sunday night, I worked my
regular shift in the dining hall, and
while working, I spoke with one
of the chefs to help pass the time
when customers were not in line for
food. Upon talking to him, a student
worker, Carlton, came to the station
to deliver clean dishes. Carlton
lingered for a minute, making a
comical statement to us, and before
leaving,the chef requested his name.
"Carlton," he responded, "but not
like the 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."'
I laughed instantly, registering
that Carlton did share the name of a
well-known character from the show.
While laughing, I heard the chef and
Carlton sustain the conversation.
Carlton delivered an explanation,
stating that people typically learn
his name and urge him to do the
"Carlton dance." Shortly after
Carlton left, the chef and I ended our
laughter, then he shocked me with an
unexpected remark.
"He doesn't look like a Carlton,

maybe a Deandre or a Jackson."
What? I hoped I'd heard him
wrong, hoped that his statement
wasn't meant to sound as prejudiced
as it had. What made Carlton not
"look" like a Carlton?
"It's just that Carlton sounds so
proper and preppy,"he continued.
The sentence sounded like it
was missing a "but." What? Carlton
sounds so proper and preppy, but
Carlton doesn't "look" proper
and preppy?
I attempted to tune him out,
fearing that he would say something
else that I didn't like. I tried focusing
on my ownthoughts concerning what
Iheard but could still hear his voice.
"You don't meet many Carltons
since he's Black with tattoos,
one could assume that he's from
the hood."
According to the chef, the
name "Carlton" is preppy. The
term "preppy" carries certain
connotations, such as expensive,
upper-middle class and nice clothes.
What was Carlton's "role" in society?
A non-preppy, Black man with
tattoos from the hood? Carlton may
not look "preppy," but nothing about
him screams that he isn't. What if he
doesn'tplayhis"role"properly? What
if he comes from a wealthy family
and a nice neighborhood? What if he
attended a prep school that led him
to "Go Blue" here-at the University?
Neither Carlton's name nor race
speaks to who he is as a person or
where he's from.
At this point, I let the chef talk to
himselfforthe remainder ofthe night.
I busied myself with imaginary work
to avoid any further conversation.
My best friend worked the same shift
but was placed at a different station
for the duration of the shift. This
bothered me. This time I needed to
talk to her about how ignorant the
chef was and how annoyed I was
by the whole situation. I needed to
get these aggravated feelings off my
chest. When 10 o'clock hit, my best
friend and I clocked out, and when
we started our walk home, I began
ranting. I went on and on about what
I experienced at work and the chef's
racist and preconceived notions

of Carlton.
My conversation with her led
me to think about my English class
and our various discussions on
racism, sexism, classism, etc. and
the normative. Norms shape for us
what's normal, and this notion comes
from majority group in society. In
the United States, the dominant
group is white. The problem arises
when the belief of groups of majority/
dominant is seen as normal or right.
Unfortunately, we live in a culture
where majority rules.
If Carlton were not a Black male
with tattoos, would he have been
judged by his name and skin color?
What if he were not male at all, would
this person still be from the hood? Is
it a normal assumption that Black
people with body ink only possess
non-preppy names and are from
the hood?
What happens when people don't
play their "roles" properly? Do the
members of society who create these
rules and roles become shocked?
I couldn't agree more with the
main character in "Rubyfruit
Jungle" when stating, "Why does
everyone have to put you in a box
and nail the lid on it?" That's exactly
what the chef did to Carlton; he
used small-minded thinking to
compartmentalize him as a non-
preppy, Black man with tattoos
from the hood. Carlton should be
viewed on the basis of his character
versus the "roles." I wonder if the
chef thought, for a fraction of a
second, that his initial thoughts of
Carton were incorrect. Instead of
viewing Carlton on the basis of his
character after speaking with him
briefly, he used society's roles to
define him and dictate his behavior.
The chef contributes to the majority
group, and until they speak against
the use of labels and roles to define
people, we will continuously live
in a society full of poor stereotypes
and misconstrued norms. As you go
about your daily routines, think of
your "role" in society. Think of the
"norms" and who created them.

and impassioned, as she recounted her past three
years at the University. Though initially a part of
the MichiganAthletic Department, and member
of the women's varsity rowing team during her
first two years, Haugen made the difficult deci-

pursue the Graham Undergraduate Sustainabil-

In the midst ofther sophomore year, Haugen

ultimately realized that her interests did not fit
the mold of any one conventional major - and
she created an additional major ofther own. As
a double major in Human-Animal Studies (a
hybrid of hard science and social sciences as
they pertain to the study of the relationship
between humans and animals) and the Program
in the Environment, Haugen is wholeheartedly
dedicated to advancing the work and studies of
wildlife conservation.
It is this genuine thirst for both education
and service that has led Haugen on numerous

taking expeditions to France, South Africa,
Thailand and China. She's become versed
in wildlife management, as well as wildlife
veterinary science, ecosystems, biodiversity
and conservation. She's worked hands-on

TWEET YOUR BEST STUDY
TIPS AND SPOTS BY USING
#MGOSTUDY
TO BE FEATURED NEXT WEEK

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Weekend Roundup Editor
Even though it's just the
beginning of October, you
should probably be starting to
think about where you want to
live next year. If you've decided
to leave the dorms, you'll need
to find the off-campus location
best for you - and soon.
Off-campus housing goes
fast, if you couldn't already tell
by how many of your friends are
asking themselves, "Where's
the right place for me?" If you
decide not to start searching
early, you may end up living
in an apartment or house that
doesn't meet your standards.
So as you look for off-campus
housing, keep these tips and
tricks in mind, so that you end
up living comfortably for the
2015-2016 school year.
FIND YOUR ROOMMATES
I highly recommend living
with your friends. Sure, some
websites have a "roommate
expert," but how often do those
sorts of things actually work
out? Next thing you know,
you could be living with a
train-wreck. If you had a bad
roommate while living in the
dorms, I'm sure going into an
apartment blind isn't for you
either.
It's early in the school year,
however, so get a feel for your
friend group and pick from your
closest friends for whom you'd
want to live with for an entire
year. This is the most crucial
step in the process, so take it
slowly and carefully.

ASK FOR SUGGESTIONS
Ifyouknowanyupperclassmen
or students who have previously
lived off campus, ask them where
the best place to live is. They will
provide valuable information
on which places to avoid, which
have the nicest rooms and which
give the most enjoyable living
standard. You may not actually
look into what they tell you, but
it certainly helps to have some
guidance when looking for an
apartment or house.
MAKE USE OF RESOURCES
There are many resources
available online to help look for
housing. Cribspot offers a bird's-
eye view of campus that reveals
all of the locations that are
-leasing. With a price-range slider
on your screen, you can narrow
your options to what's within
your reach financially.
The University of Michigan
also has a website dedicated to
looking for off-campus housing,
and it showcases some of the
most popular living areas on
campus.
Housing Ann Arbor also has a
list of landlords on campus along
with links to their websites,
where you can find floor plans,
pricing and amenities.
ORGANIZE YOUR OPTIONS
Once you begin to look at
off-campus housing options,
narrow down your options to
about- five places. There are a
lot of factors to consider when
choosing off-campus housing,
including:

PRICE
The most important factor in
deciding where to live is price.
Typically, the cheaper you go,
the lesser the quality. However,
there are some places where you
can pay less while living large.
These are rarities, but you may
strike gold.
. SPACE
Look at the floor plan.
Once you've gotten the price
range, find out what the actual
apartments look like. Take into
consideration whether you want
your own room, which will likely
cost you more. Also take a look at
the living room, because if you
ever plan to have company over,
you'll want to avoid a crammed
hangout.
AMENITIES
Find out what is included
with the apartment. Some rents
include paying for utilities (water,
electricity, internet and cable),
which will eliminate the burden
of paying bills on top of your rent.
Other places will avoid slapping
an additional parking pass fee on
you and allow you one for free.
Aside from additional fees,
many apartment complexes
include social amenities: workout
rooms, sun deck, billiards table
and game room, etc. These make
living off campus that much
more enjoyable, but usually come
at a higher cost of living.
LOCATION
Location is everything. You
won't want to be too far from
campus, or else you'll feel
stranded. Live near a bus stop or
academic buildings if possible,
making the trek from class
and back that much easier, and

allowing you to make lunch at
home if needed. It's also nice to
live near restaurants if you don't
feel like cooking. Trust me:you're
going to end up not wanting to
make a full meal.
Warning: If you live next to
Back Room pizza, you will go
broke. One-dollar slices of pizza
three nights a week for two
semesters adds up faster than
you think.

ILLUSTRATION BY JAKE WELLINS
MAKE A DECISION
With all these things in mind,
it's time to make a decision on
where you want to live. Don't
fret, because it's not as stressful
as everyone makes it out to be.
Once you've made the choice
to live off campus, consult with
your roommates, read the lease
carefully and patiently wait
several months until you can
move in. That's when the real fun
begins.

Congratulations! You're out
of the dorms and are officially
living on your own. You've
traded in a dining hall for an
oven, Resident Advisors for
landlords and room and board
payments for rent and utilities
checks. While living off campus
has many perks, it also comes
with more responsibility. Living
on your own in college is like
dipping a toe into the ocean of
adulthood. Meals, payments,
safety and cleanliness are now
in your hands. But hey, at least
you can host a pregame without
having to whisper. Here are
some tips to help you in the
transition from dorm life to
house life.
THE KITCHEN
The kitchen will probably be
the biggest topic of debate in any
house. It gets messy easily and
when it is messy, everyone will
be hungry and unhappy. Wipe

WWW.CARLSONPROPERTIES.-
COM
734-332-6000o

down countertops and cooktops
after every meal. Don't leave
dirty dishes stacked in the sink;
it's gross. If the dishwasher is
too full to cram in your cereal
bowl, that's the hint to switch it
on and wash your bowl by hand.
If the dishes in the machine
are clean, then it's your turn to
empty it out before putting new
dirty dishes in.
NOISE
Thankfully, an RA won't
knock on your door to force
you to turn down the music
on a Saturday night, but Ann
Arbor walls are thin, so your
housemates might. Most
college kids are on completely
different schedules. While you
might be Rick's Ready, your
housemate might have a test
or a cold. Discuss pregame or
parties during the week with
your house, and try to leave at a
relatively reasonable hour. (And
with the line at Skeeps being
what it is these days, that means
around 9:45 anyway.)

OVERNIGHT GUESTS
First of all, here is a high five.
Secondly, if they are staying for
more than one night clear it with
your housemates, especially
if it is a person of the opposite
gender than those in your house.
MONEY
Ask your landlord how he or
she wants rent to be paid. It's a
pain if you and your roommates
must pay rent on one check,
but if this is your situation
then designate one person to
collect everyone's rent a week
or two in advice and then write
a check for the full amount.
Utilities almost always have to
be done this way, so designate
a second person to take charge.
Communal items like toilet
paper, dishwashing liquid and
salt should be rotated between
housemates so everyone pays an
equal amount.
LOCK YOUR DOORS
This one's pretty self-
explanatory.

In the defensive half,
Michigan contained and'
controlled the Broncos for most
of the match. With the exception
of two instances, where
freshman goaltender Evan
Louro had to punch out a cross
and a sprawl to stave off a free
kick, there was little action in
front of the Wolverine net until
the overtime goal.
Michigan's best chance to
grab the lead came early in the
second half on what seemed like
a relatively innocuous free kick
from 40 yards out. Sophomore
defender Rylee Woods launched
a high, looping ball that evaded
the Bronco goalkeeper but rang
off the crossbar.
The shot became just another
tally on a long list of missed
opportunities.

"We're having good
performances," Daley said. "But
we're not getting any kind of
fortunate bounces. We hit the
crossbar, had a half volley go
right to the goalie - it's not luck
sometimes, but maybe we're just 4
unlucky at this point."
Michigan will certainly need
some bounces in the coming
weeks. The non-conference
loss is a setback that hurts
the team's already deflated
confidence. As they enter the
paramount portion of their
schedule - playing four more
games in the next two weeks -
the Wolverines are focused on
using the Big Ten to salvage their
postseason hopes.
"We have 10 games to go,"
Daley said. "Not all is lost. We're
disappointed, yes, but we'll live
to fight another day. Now the Big
Ten becomes our primary focus."

What's she hiding?

The problem with
Ariana Grande.

Pop superstar's
persona lacks
indentifiable
it' factor
ByGIBSONJOHNS
DailyArts Writer
Ever since she dropped
"Problem," the lead single
for her sophomore album
My Everything, Ariana
Grande has been unavoidable
throughout most of 2014.
She's had three top-10 singles
and a No.,l album, she opened
this year's VMAs and has
appeared on nearly every
major late-night and morning
show, including as the musical
guest on the season premiere
of "Saturday Night Live"
this past weekend. It's easy
to look at Ariana Grande's
skyrocketing fame and
success and blindly assume
that she must possess all the
elements of a superstar. But
in reality, despite her label
(intelligently) pulling out the
stops to ensure her success,
it's plain to see that that's
simply not the case.
Let's start with Grande's
debut album Yours Truly.
Piggybacking off of her
popularity as a star on two
Nickelodeon shows and the
positive reception of her
Mac Miller-assisted debut
single, "The Way," the album
shot to No. 1 and was widely
praised for its '90s R&B
sound. People said she was
the second coming of Mariah
Carey. Though the rest of
the album didn't yield any
other genuine hits, there was
an overwhelming amount
of excitement' surrounding
Grande. She won New Artist
of the Year at the 2013
American Music Awards
following a stellar, soulful
performance of album track
"Tattooed Heart." The retro
performance garnered her
a standing ovation and put
her powerful voice in -the
spotlight. She stole the show
on one of music's biggest
nights and had a lot of people
highly anticipating her next
move.
Fast forward to April of
this year with the release
of "Problem." Quickly, and
deservedly, the song shot to
No. 3 on the Hot 100 and was
immediately inescapable.
Though her team may have
"taken a risk" by launching
her second album with a
track that didn't even feature
its singer on the chorus (Big
Sean whispers it), it still
ticked all the boxes. Expertly
produced with an on-trend
saxophone backing (see:
Jason Derulo's "Talk Dirty")?
Check. Lyrics penned by none
other than pop-mastermind
Max Martin? Check. Features
by not one, but two of

mainstream hip hop's biggest
names (Iggy Azalea and Big
Sean)? Check.
Listen, I'm not claiming
that everything released
to Top 40 radio these days
isn't similarly calculated to
ensure success. But whereas
someone like Rihanna seems
heavily involved in making
those calculations to ensure
her perspective remains
intact, I can't help but feel
as if Grande probably isn't
involved in making many of
those decisions. What is her
point of view? Does she even
have a signature sound? She
all but abandoned the '90s
R&B vibe that garnered her
so much praise for Yours
Truly for dancefloor-ready
beats that fit right in with
everything else on the radio
these days. I acknowledge
that artists, especially ones
as young as Grande, need to
evolve their sound to .keep
things exciting for their fans
and to stay current, but My
Everything represents such
a change in sound that, in
my mind, the Mariah Carey
comparisons don't really
hold up anymore. It seems
as though Grande (read: her
label) decided on a regression
of originality in order to
achieve a progression in
fame.
"Break Free," another
incredible pop song that
features EDM-powerhouse
Zedd, was the second release
from My Everything and
represented an even further
departure from her original
sound than "Problem" did,
while simultaneously proving
to be equally as pervasive.
"Love Me Harder" is perhaps
the best song on the album
and is Grande's upcoming
third single. It's a sexy Max
Martin-written track and
will surely be another smash
for her.
Though individually
these songs are undoubtedly
remarkable pop confections,
together they fail to represent
a cohesive image of Grande as
an artist and seem to be the
result of a by-the-numbers
approach to achieving pop
success. Again, this isn't all
that unusual in the world of
pop music, but as becomes
easily evident during her live
performances and interviews,
this may be a result of
Grande's apparent lack of
distinguishable personality
and stage presence.
Most of Grande's live
performances lately go
like this: the universally
recognizable first few
seconds of one of her hits
plays before Grande is
revealed at the center of the
stage on a raised platform.
She's wearing thigh-high
go-go boots and some sort of
extravagant leotard, her hair
done up in her signature high
ponytail. After being helped

down the stairs by one of
her many back-up dancers,
she breaks into dance during
the song's chorus. Her
dancing is lackadaisical, and
her eyes exhibit a deer-in-
the-headlights discomfort.
Probably as a result of her
extensive dancing, she
sounds out of breath and
fails to enunciate throughout
most of the verses. She might
even yell out a "Let's go!" to
try to get the crowd into it.
For the money note, Grande
almost nails it as she brings
out some Aguilera-esque arm
waves. As a viewer, though
you are trying your hardest
to enjoy the performance (a
song this deliciously catchy
deserves an equally amazing
performance), you likely
feel just as uncomfortable
as Grande does. Comparing
this to her aforementioned
American Music Awards
performance from last year
and this is particularly
disappointing.
You don't have to look
very far for examples of
these performances. This
happened at the VMAs, the
iHeartRadio Festival and
"X Factor" Australia, among
others (let's not even get
into Rihanna laughing at her
in the audience during her
iHeartRadio Music Awards
performance). In interviews,
most notably with Matt Lauer
on "TODAY," she displays
a similar disinterest in her
surroundings and spits out
repetitive answers to every
question posed at her. Though
this initially comes as a
shock, it falls directly in line
with the rumors of her diva-
like behavior and continuous
scorning of fans. None of
it is shockingly offensive
or disrespectful, but one
can't help but think that the
predictable nature of her
breakout year is an attempt
by her label to distract us
from her lack of the "it"
factor. Where is the spark and
passion in her eyes? In the
year following the uniquely
outrageous breakthrough of
Miley Cyrus, Grande's feels
especially uninteresting.
Miley may have lacked a bit of
taste, but at least she sparked
discussion and made sure
that every little thing she did
represented her point of view
and wacky personality.
Grande's music may
represent some of the year's
best Top 40 offerings, and
the general public may be
embracing her for what her
label wants the world to see
her as - a flawless pop starlet
whose talents and looks
check off all the boxes -
but does "she genuinely have
everything it takes to be a
convincing global superstar?
The answer may still be
unclear.
As for yours truly, I'm not
so convinced.

vomiting the words "she's just so talented" onto Chris Pratt's face. But as
we get deeper into the sketches - a Marvel franchise based around shop-
ping carts, a "Key & Peele" ripoff where imaginary NFL players recite

clear Pratt is being buried behind a barrage of bad writing. He stands

TRAILER REVIEW

4

The trailer of "Gone Girl,"
directed by David Fincher
("The Social Network") and
starring
Ben Affleck f
("Argo") and
Rosamund Gone Girl
Pike ("The
World's 20th Century Fox
End") oozes
profound
sentiments of devotion and
care as a man steps onto a
stage in front of a crowd to
tell them that his wife has
disappeared. His voice isn't
heavy, but you can feel the
emotion behind the words.
The emotion permeates
through this clip to the next
few shots, which show the
couple in love, and the shots
almost seem to waltz to the
accompanying music of the
trailer.
Suddenly, however, some-
thing's not right. The couple:
fights; there's a fair bit of

tension as she exclaims that
it can't go on like this and he
is implied to throw her on the
floor in rage. Then, you see
shots of him standing next to
a photo of his missing wife,
grinning as he does it. The
loving, tender sentiment now
sours, turning into suspicion
as we get the feeling that this
man is struggling to make the
world see that he did not kill
his wife. The emotion doesn't

go away and the trailer ends,
leaving the viewer curious
and involved. The sudden
change in emotion juxta-
posed with the uniformity
in the tender feeling of the
soundtrack comes across as
eerie and is the defining ele-
ment of this preview.
Did he really kill his wife?
After seeing this trailer, you'll
desperately want toknow.

WOLV-TV
From Page 1B
A group of eager
underclassmen crowds the
modern and minimalist space of
the North Quad Residence Hall
lobby. Students circle around
three main stations of activity
- a snack table complete with
lollipops advertising CBS's new
series "Scorpion" (the candy
apparently has a scorpion
inside!), a camera and tripod
set up for free headshots and
North Quad's former help desk,
now boasting a "WOLV-TV"
sign and computers and editing
stations behind the counter.
Among the attendees, the
current WOLV-TV staffers
and board members are
characterized by the looks
. of pride on their faces. This
is their opportunity to share
their new home with potential
recruits, which is all the
more exciting considering
the club's two years in exile.
WOLV-TV, the University of
Michigan's first (and only)
television station, had filmed
in South Quad since the club
was founded in 1994, but when
South Quad announced their
plans for renovations in 2012,
WOLV realized that it would
have to find a new home.
Though the South Quad
studios were conveniently
located on Central Campus, its
location in a dorm was hardly
ideal. WOLV was partnered
with University Housing,
which helped getting WOLV
content playing on dorm TV
sets and with access to the
University's studio equipment,
but members often had trouble
getting into the building at
night (when many shows are
filmed), and their studio space
was surrounded on all sides by
South Quad's community center
and computer lab.
Enter Argus, the former home
of the University of Michigan's
Film and Video department
facilities that had remained
mostly vacant ever since Screen
Arts and Cultures moved to
North Quad. The equipment
was outdated and the location
inconvenient (over a mile off
campus, anearly impossible walk
during the winter), but WOLV
made it work, and managed to
keep up filming for each of its
shows during the transition year.
That's not to say that their
time at Argus was easy.
"The space is different, and
when you get used to doing
something the same way for so
* long, for you to finally (realize)
that your sets are different, the
locations are different, your
office is different, and to have it,
be off-campus ... means that (it's
impossible) to operate the same
way we could in South Quad,"
Elizabeth McLaughlin, LSA
senior and WOLV-TV's General
Manager said.
WOLV-TV's morning news
show, "Wake Up with WOLV,"
faced a unique difficulty, since
it was one of the few shows that
filmed in the morning. "Wake
Up" co-Host Sarah Ponczek,
an LSA senior, didn't have a
car and had to get a ride to set

every Friday morning (at 8 a.m.,
no less). "It was a little difficult,
every Friday morning," Ponczek
laughs.
But while Argus provided
many challenges, it also opened
up new opportunities. "Wake
Up with WOLV" utilized
Argus' kitchen sets and invited
Spoon University to do cooking
segments on the show, which
was impossible with South
Quad's basic sets.
"We really made the most of
our space, but at the same time,
it was just (logistically) very
difficult," Ponczek said.
North Quad, on the other
hand, offers countless new
opportunities and a significant
upgrade in technology and
equipment. WOLV will now
share studio space with the
department of Screen Arts and
Cultures, which means that their
cameras and lighting equipment
are the same high-end ones that
film students use. The help desk
in North Quad's lobby has been
transformed into a WOLV office,
complete with editing desks and
massive hard drives to process all
of WOLV-TV's weekly content.
The move to North Quad
also brings with it a bigger
partnership between WOLV and
the two academic departments
housed at North Quad:
Communication Studies and
SAC. WOLV will remain student

ARTIST AANINGAD
AVA~N AD

ByADAMDEPOLLO
Daily Online Arts Editor
When I met School of Art &
Design junior Chris Terrell to
interview him, he immediately
stuck out as the musician in the
crowd at Espresso Royale.
I had listened to the songs
on his Soundcloud page - he
describes his music as "mellow,
acoustic songwriting" - and
was immediately reminded of
artists like Jason Mraz and John
Mayer, both of whom he lists as
influences. But while Terrell's
music is distinguished by his
sparse, jazz-tinged guitar playing,
what really sets him apart from
the songwriters informing his
style is the strong, soulfully warm
timbre of his voice.
It's a voice that could only
belong to a person like Terrell,
whose quiet, self-effacing
demeanor belies a confident
passion for songwriting.
Thatpassion,Terrellexplained,
developed partlyout of his family
background.
"My family has always been
very musical," he said. "I have a
giant family - I'm one ofnine kids
- and we're all pretty musically
talented in one way or another.
Growing up, everyone always
said we would either be the next
Jackson Five or start our own
softball league."
Rather than invest in matching
jumpsuits, however, Terrell and
his siblings have embarked on
different paths musically while
still inspiring each other to
continue working and developing
as artists. Terrell's older brother,
inparticular, serves as anexample
for him to follow.
"(My brother) will go three
days without eating, just working
on music," he said. "He's really
intense about it, but I respect it.
His work ethic is something to
strive for."
Having other successful
musicians in the family does
inevitably lead to some rivalry,
though.
"(My brother) and his band just
flew out to L.A. and talked with
Sony," Terrell said, "and they've
got a record deal. And he's just a
year older than me - I'm kind of
jealous, honestly."
But,siblingrivalry aside, Terrell
is most focused on continuing to

sode of the season, the show
takes a procedural detour to
investigate
the sinister

children. Ten- Tuesdays
sions arise at 9 p.m.
with cynical FOX
Gordon and
his bureau-

develop his own sound, which, he
explained, is an extension of his
naturally demure disposition.
"I've always been a quieter,
reserved person, so I just started
writing things down and then
naturally started singing them.
I kind of got into songwriting by
just writing."
And, as you might expect,
that reserved demeanor presents
something of a challenge for
musicians like Terrell when they
goto perform in alive setting.
"In smaller, more intimate
settings where you don't know
most of the people, you can see
all of their eyes looking at you,"
Terrell said. "Iget really cold, very
cold, I shake, I'mvery nervous."
But it certainly doesn't show.
He seems just as confident in live
shows as he does on tape and, as
he somewhat reluctantly admits,
the response from audiences is
always positive.
"It'sweirdforme,"hesaid."You
do a performance and everyone
comes up to you like 'That's great,

DJ Relly Rell's production is
simple but on point, provid-
ing the perfect platform for
Bada$$'s signature style.
Given the "post-rap" vibe
that most artists have been
pursuing during the last
few months, Bada$$ has
defied the trend with this
single, leaning on hip-hop
fundamentals in favor of
over-produced, atmospheric
embellishments. The sim-
plicity of the track allows
Joey's verses to shine, and
his lyrical abilities take cen-
ter stage to great effect.
Although the track has all
of the right ingredients pres-!
ent, the ratios are slightly
off - I think "Get Paid" .
would've benefited from a 1
little less chorus and a touch
more verse - but that is only'
a testament to Bada$$'s cre--

words over red wine, as power-

Cobblepot's future as rein-

In the future, Terrell plans
to solidify the foundation he's
already established as a singer
and guitarist while also drawing
on other genres like hip hop
and R&B for inspiration. He's
also increasing his involvement
with Empty Mug Records, an
independent, student-run label
started at the University to
compile and distribute music by
students.
As he moves forward with his
music, it seems that Terrell will
continue.to be his own harshest
critic.
"(I can) definitely improve
the nervousness, you know,
guitar and stuff like that," he
said. "Some of my melodies are
really repetitive, like, within
the songs. If I could do a solo or
something like that, that would
be cool."
But, at thesame time, he's
confident that he has ;the skills
necessary to make his artistic
vision a reality.

to grow their record label into a
full-service operation dedicated to
helping student artists in any way
they can;that includes production,
distribution, designing album
artwork, press photos and more.
"Basically anything you would
need as a musician besides literally
sitting down and playing the
guitar, we can help you with,"
Stange said.
"Everythingis in-house,"Phelps
added. "So everything that we do
or help create, we are working on
that within our label ... We have
everyone from sound engineers,
more business-minded people,
financial, promotion, marketing
and then Meta and I primarily
deal with reaching out to artists
specifically. But it's all in-house
so everything that we do comes
fromthe people who we work with
directly."
Because it provides so many
services to its artists, Empty
Mug Records is as much about
the people behind the scenes
as it is about those in front of
the microphone. The company
prioritizes creativity, collaboration
andmostimportantly,inclusivity-
the greater the diversity inaskillset,
the greater the opportunity for
everyone involved to learn and
grow. In time, the co-presidents
hope that the label will not only
become a platform for artists but
also a network for people who are
interested in pursuing music in any
capacity.
"That's one of our main goals:
to make it very inclusive and very
collaborative because we want
people to share their ideas if they
know how to do something better
than us," Phelps said. "We want
to hear that to make this the best
thing possible."
Empty Mug Records' initial
success is exactly what Levine
hoped would come from the
program funded by the Third
Century Grant:to dispel the notion
that people are either creative or
business-minded.
"(My former interns) proposed

applying for one of the ... grants
from the Provost's office to develop
a program around entrepreneuria
skills for humanity students with
the idea ... being that many of us
who are interested in the arts
assume we are not interested or
competent in business," Levine
said. "And actually business is
incredibly creative and ideally
about being creative and effective
withthat.So,the proposalwemade
had to do with developingbusiness4
skills for humanity students."
Going forward, Phelps and
Stange will seek funding in the
form of external grants; searching
for additional funding is a large
part of one of Empty Mug's
departments. Currently, the group
has just over 30 members, with
interest growing rapidly among
the student community - both
regarding the organization and its
music.
"My moment of validation from
this whole process was this fall
when we were passing out flyers
to come to our mass meeting and
someone (said), 'Oh yeah I heard
this compilation on Bandcamp.'"
Regardingthe name ofthe label,
Phelps admits she had a hard time
making a decision.
"We had to find a name right
away and I was writing down
lists and lists and trying to figure
out what was going on and I was
actually talking to one of my
friends who works at a coffee shop
and he actually thought of the
name Empty Mug and it was kind
of catchy. It's different," Phelps
said.
"It fits now because we are
motivated by creativity, passion
and coffee," Stange added.
While this maybe true, Levine
was a bit more metaphorical in her
interpretation.
"One of the challenges for
student organizations with great
energy and momentum is that
students graduate, and so I think
the symbolism of constantly
refilling the mug actually gives
some potential longevity to this."

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

PharrellWilliams's"It Girl"is
by far the mostvisuallyinterest-
ing musicvideo Ihave seen in
along time.
The produc- A
tion combines
anime-like It Girl
scenes, old
school video Pharrell,
game graphics
and even some Williams
bizarre, neon Columbia
inverse color-
ing of a danc-
ing Pharrell.
Themusic videoopens up on
a sandy cartoon beach. As Phar-
rell begins the first verse, musing
"my compass spinning baby," a
compass in the sand is shown
spinning onthe beach. Such
continuity between the lyrics

and visuals occurs sporadically
throughout.
The next scene is a grooving
Pharrell, with his entire body
flashing and filled in by bright,
neon colors. The background is
plastered with hundreds offloat-
ing little characters and symbols
of origins I am not knowledgeable
enough to know. The stimulus
overload from thisscene makes
it absolutely off-the-wall and
unique.
A video game that looks a lot
like Maplestory then pops up
on the screen with Pharrell as
the skateboarding protagonist,
but then quickly changes into an
anime beachscene of sorts.
I could definitely see "It
Girl"getting some heat for this
video here, as there are plenty of

younglookinggirls in bathing
suits who certainlyhave clearly
definedum, proportions. While
this maybe typical of anime/
mangaystyle art, Pharrell lurking
in the background with a pair of
binoculars inspectingthegirls
definitely sets a creepy vibe.
The music video proceedsto
alternateebetween its computer
generated trippiness, cutesy video
game sets and anime scenes until
finally rollingout the credits in
a'similar fashionto Pokomon
games on GameBoy.
Personally, my favorite part of
"It Girl" comes alittle after the
half way mark, when cheesy-vid-
eo-game Pharrell buys a dolphin
spaceship, goes to outer space,
shoots some bad guys and visits
Galactic Mount Rushmore with

'm bringing booty
back / Go ahead and
tell them skinny
bitches that." I cringe every
time I hear the line - which
is often, considering I've had
Meghan
Trainor's
"All About
That Bass"
on repeat
since mid-
June. The
song, which
originally NATALIE
was praised GADBOIS
as body-
Positive
and revolutionary in an
industry that rarely cel-
ebrates women who aren't
the size of a malnourished
12-year-old, is now under-
going an onslaught of not
unjustified backlash from
outlets as varied as Jeze-
bel and The Guardian. The
lyrics, meant to empower
women who rarely see
reflections of themselves in
the media, just as equally
shame those who are classi-
cally thin. (Though Trainor
does quickly slide in the
phrase "No, I'm just play-
ing," a weak attempt to jus-
tify her slight.)
Perhaps even more menac-
ing is the song's consistent
referral to patriarchal and
heteronormative ideals.
You are beautiful no matter
what size you are because
boys wanna hold your booty
at night. It's an inherently
problematic message we are
teaching to girls; you are
al'wo'rthvhile, bt'ionily in
relation to what-boys think
of you. You all are beautiful
(because being beautiful is
very very very important),
but this beauty can only be
seen through male eyes.
It's insidious, negative
and downright concerning.
But I don't care. I'll repeat
it: I still fucking love this
song.
I'm known to be a pretty
vigilant feminist. My friends
often feel the need to temper
their language and stories
around me so as not to risk
pissing me off. (In other
news, I am the worst to
watch Superbowl commer-
cials with.) Because of my
reputation, multiple people
asked me what I thought
about this song, if I agreed it
was problematic. It's hard to
honestly answer in the affir-
mative when my rallying cry
at every pregame is "Play
'All About That Bass' again,
please!" (Usually without the
'please'). Should I feel guilty
for loving this song? It's a
question that often troubles
activists - if one part of
something is problematic, do
we need to disregard all of it?
When I find cheese with a
bit of mold on it, I throw the
whole damn thing away - no
need to take an unneces-
sary risk. But my grandma
just slices that mold right off
and acts like the cheese is
as good as new. Can we just
as easily slice off the sexism

and negative stereotyping in
"All About That Bass" and
still appreciate the song?
Last year Dove released
a video called "Real Beauty
Sketches," as part of its ongo-
ing self esteem campaign.
The video had a sketch artist
first draw women based on
how they describe them-
selves - strong jaw, round
face, too many freckles.
The same artist then drew
these women based on how
other people described
them. Unsurprisingly, the
women were much harsher
when describing themselves
- these images were consis-
tently "uglier" than those
described by other people.
The campaign was praised
for shedding a light on the
crushing self-consciousness

so many women feel about
the way they look. It was
also decried for promoting
the beauty ideal - being
beautiful means you are
thin, symmetrical, with
prominent cheekbones and
clear skin.
The campaign was dis-
tinctly imperfect - acci-
dentally upholding some
of the norms it meant to
deconstruct. But at the
end of the day the intent
was wholesome - remind-
ing women that they are
all beautiful. And for every
scholarly article I read about
how the Real Beauty cam-
paign was problematic, there
was another girl posting on
Facebook about how that
video had, at least for a little
while, made her reconsider
how she viewed herself. The
question at stake becomes,
what is more important to
furthering social change?
Political correctness, or
widespread individual
impact?
Back to "All About That
Bass." What I know about
this song: It's surprisingly
sexist and disappointingly
one-dimensional in what it
defines as a real woman. It
also is openly celebratory
of women who aren't size
twos, as the first verse so
proudly proclaims, and the
resonance of this statement
can't be overlooked. In fifth
grade I worshiped Carmen
from the "Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants," not only
for her candor, but because
I looked more like'Wr'han
most teens I had sen ibTV
or in the movies. Even in
this, the 'Year of the Booty,'
what other songs (or TV
shows, or movies) openly
celebrate bigger or even just
regular-sized women? Even
if they exist, how many have
enchanted as broad an audi-
ence - and had quantifiable
industry success - as much
as "Bass"? Even if other peo-
ple are talking about body-
positivity, finally everyone
is listening.
I don't care.
I'll repeat it: I
still love this
fucking song.
Throughout the summer
my 15-year-old cousin Kelly
would send me texts each
time "Bass" would move
up in the charts. Together
we screamed the lyrics and
learned the dance moves
from the video and tried to
teach our dolthead brothers
why the song was important.
Beyond actual blood ties and
general anatomy, Kelly and
I are quite different - she's
outgoing where I'm awk-
ward, pretty and primped
while I wear Chacos and

pajama pants to buy boxed
wine, the Homecoming Prin-
cess to my Vice President
of the Harry Potter Club.
But we both were drawn to
and powerfully buoyed by
"All About That Bass." Ifa
three-minute pop song has
the power to make two such
different girls, at completely
different stages in our lives,
feel good about ourselves,
then it contributes immea-
surable value. Not to say
that we should stop talking
about why it's problematic.
But Kelly and I aren't going
to stop dancing. And I don't
think anyone else should
either.
Gadbois is never going to stop
dancing. Send encouragement
to gadbnat@umich.edu.

Pharrell'sface (and hat) chiseled

Even from the start of the
music video, it's clear that the
computer-generated animations
and effects of "It Girl" allow for
fantastical outside-of-the-box
thinking that makes this pro-
duction well worth five min-
utes of your time.
