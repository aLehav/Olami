1,000 Pitches competition

Organization
narrows 4,500
contest applicants
to nine projects
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
1000 Pitches, one of eight proj-
ects directed by the e trepre-
neurial organization MPowered,
narrowed a pool of nearly 4,500
University student pitches to just

nine Monday.
The University has been 1000
Pitches' vanguard since the
organization was established
on campus seven years ago. The
entrepreneurial contest has also
made its way to Penn State Uni-
versity's campus, but its national
scope did not fully evolve until
this past year when 1KP found
a home away from home at four
additional institutions. The orga-
nization has received more than
7,500 pitches in total this year,
nearly 4,500 of which came from
the University.

Nine winners received prize
money to support their ideas.
Students can pitch ideas as an
individual or as a group. Each
individual is allowed up to three
pitches which last anywhere from
30 seconds to three minutes.
Student groups, some of which
have competed in other competi-
tions such as optiMize, partici-
pate to gain additional funding.
Additionally, some individuals
are required to participate by
courses such as the Ross School
of Business's Entrepreneurship
Hour.

The categories for the competi-
tion were Environment, Health,
Consumer Products & Small Busi-
nesses, U-Provements, Education,
Web & Software, Tech & Hard-
ware, Mobile Apps and Research.
A sports category was also spon-
sored by Bizdom, a startup accel-
erator in Detroit.
Some winning ideas included
biodegradable isolationgowns, an
automated washer and dryer sys -
tem that to the audience's delight
also folds clothes and an app that

City approves
resolution to
consider FOIA
policy changes
By JACK TURMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
The Ann Arbor City Council
voted on several resolutions at its
meeting Monday, including the
adoption of revised Council rules
and protocols for releasing public
documents under the Freedom of
Information Act.
Resolution to adopt revised
Councilrules
Councilmembers passed a res-
olution to revise multiple Council
rules, including those governing
limitations on speaking times.
The final resolution included sev-
eral amendments that were suc-
cessfully tacked onto the original
proposal.
Councilmember Jack Eaton
(D-Ward 4) proposed an amend-
ment, which passed with six
votes, to eliminate a section of
the rules that cap councilmem-
bers' speaking time at 25 minutes.
Eaton argued the cap is unneces-
sary.
"It's pointless to try to stifle
debate to arbitrary time limits,"
he said. "We should all be more
respectful of each other's time."
Councilmember Chuck

Warpehoski (D-Ward5) opposed
the amendment, but not because
he disagreed with Eaton's propos-
al. Warpehoski said he would like
to give the current time limit a try
and evaluate its effectiveness.
Similar to Warpehoski's posi-
tion, Ann Arbor Mayor Christo-
pher Taylor (D) said the time limit
was manageable.
"Ithink this wouldbe amecha-
nism that staff could easily take
care of," Taylor said. "They could
do so in a nonjudgmental manner.
They would communicate that to
me. They would communicate to
the councilmember."
However, Councilmember Ste-
phen Kunselman (D-Ward 3) sup-
ported the amendment because he
said the time limit infringes on his
role as a representative.
"I was elected twice on behalf
of constituents,"he said. "To stifle
(debate) as a representative of con-
stituents, I think it is not demo-
cratic."
Alongwith Eaton's amendment,
Warpehoski proposed an amend-
ment, which the Council also
passed, to limit councilmembers'
speaking time on a given question
to three minutes the first time and
three minutes the second time.
The previous rule allowed council-
members to speak five minutes the
first time and three minutes the
second time.

Blood Battle
encourages
new rivalry
week goal
OSU, 'U' competed
to increase number
of organ, bone
marrow donors
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
Three life-saving donation
challenges concluded last week-
end with victories for Wolverines
and Buckeyes alike. The challeng-
es included encouraging students
to donate blood and sign up to be
organ and bone marrow donors as
well.
This year, Ohio State University
won the Blood Battle, a 33-year-
old tradition in which each school
encourages students to donate
blood in the weeks leading up to
their contentious football show-
down. Ohio State collected 2,414
pints of blood, while the Univer-
sity collected 2,298, according to a
University press release.
"It allows students aconvenient
place to donate, and, by playing
off the athletic rivalry, the Blood
Battle gives students incentive
to donate," said LSA senior Sam
Rea, an executive officer of Blood
Drives United.
The University has won the
Blood Battle each year since 2008,
except forthisyear and2012.

Panel discussion
examines poet's
voice, meaning
behind pieces
By EMMA KINERY
Daily StaffReporter
An author and a poet, Eng-
lish Prof. Laura Kasischke
wears many literary hats, often
simultaneously.
On Monday night, she spoke
at Hatcher Graduate Library
on a panel with poet Megan
Levad, assistant director of
the Helen Zell Writers' Pro-
gram, to debut her new book of
poems, "The Infinitesimals."

At the event, Kasischke read
her poems "Maid in the Moor-
way," "Mushrooms" and "At the
End of the Text a Small Bes-
tial Form." Kasischke also had
Levad read her own poem "Bul-
lying."
The audience of about 30
people was composed of com-
munity members and students.
LSA senior Bennet Johnson,
who had read Kasischke's book
in his English 424 advanced
poetry workshop, said hearing
the poems aloud gave him a dif-
ferent take on them.
"In general, her voice on the
page, for me at least, was some-
what different because I get so
absorbed into her figurative
language and I have to stop and
think about it, whereas when

you hear her read it you kind
of are pushed a little bit more
through it," Johnson said. "...
For me hearing it, I enjoyed it
more than when I read iton the
page."
While her poems are full
of vivid figurative language,
Kasischke emphasized her use
of rhymes, repetition and mys-
tery during the talk.
"I like rhyme and I like repe-
tition. It has to be what inspired
me in the first place," she said
during the panel discussion.
"A good rhyme, same with rep-
etition, there's just something
really spooky about it."
Kasischke said when she
feels a poem is not her "most
brilliant utterance," she will

ROCK AND ROLL
Music prof. continues to perform

ON STAGE. I

Bruce Conforth is a professor
of American music culture at
the University. Before starting
a career in teaching, Conforth
performed as a jazz musician
with numerous bands and toured
across the nation. In 1991, Con-
forth became the first curator of
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
and Museum in Cleveland, where
he worked with renowned Ameri-
can song artists such as Johnny
Cash, Ray Charles and Aretha
Franklin.
What inspired you to study
American pop music and
culture?
I guess growing up during the
time I did, which was in the

early '60s with the folk and blues
revival, and people like (Bob)
Dylan and the Beatles making
their mark, really inspired me
both as a performer and later as
an academic to take the whole
concept of an American popular
culture seriously. It was evident
to me that what was happening
in a cultural perspective was
going to be really important in a
historical perspective.
How was your experience as
the founding curator of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?
That's a loaded question. My
experience as the founding cura-
tor of the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame was both interesting and

eye-opening. I got to see the
music business up close and per-
sonal from the inside, got to meet
virtually all of smy idols, but also
begin to really see how much of a
business popular music is.
What is the most rewarding
part ofbeing a performer?
I still think I'm a performer. I
think teaching is a performance.
So to me, the most rewarding
part of being a performer is being
able to share something new
with your audience, whether it's
an audience to come to listen to
music or an audience of students
who come to listen to your lec-
tures.

There was no immediate

"I have seen very many vic-

told The Associated Press by

After the explosions, young
men in vigilante groups bar-
ricaded some Maiduguri roads

city. These community defense
groups and security forces are
accused of summary executions
and other rights abuses of people
they believe are extremists.
In Damaturu, explosions and
gunfire erupted before dawn
Monday causing some residents
to flee into the bush and others to
cower in their homes. The mili-
tants targeted a rapid-response
police base on the outskirts of
Damaturu, said resident Garba
Musa.
"It has been burned down
completely," he said.
Police said the attackers also
destroyed multiple buildings at
the Yobe state university, while
the Defense Ministry headquar-
ters said a fighter jet was repel-
ling the attackers. A helicopter
gunship was hovering over the
town.
Witnesses said the aircraft
drove the fighters out of Dama-
turu, strafing and bombing.
"We don't know where to hide,
the shooting is all over ... We
are running for our lives," said
resident MusaAbbas.

Police officers throw a pro-democracy protester on the main road outside governrent headquarters in Hong Kong.
Taiwan, Hong Kong a
challenge for China's Xi

Voters turn out
to support Dem.
Progressive Party
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - An
electoral pummeling for Tai-
wan's pro-Beijing ruling party
and a new spike in pro-democ-
racy protests in Hong Kong
have delivered a reality check
to Chinese President Xi Jinping
just when he was riding a wave
of high-profile diplomacy.
Xi's message of a better eco-
nomic future by joining forces
with Beijing rather than align-
ing against it doesn't seem to
be working with the electorate
in Taiwan, where voters turned
out in droves over the weekend
to support the chief opposition
Democratic Progressive Party
in local elections.
The DPP advocates more
distance between Taiwan and
China and taps into concerns
many Taiwanese have over
any eventual unification with
authoritarian Beijing.
Likewise, Xi's message is not
working with the Hong Kong
protesters, who clashed with
police early Monday as they
tried to surround government

headquarters to revitalize their
flagging movement in the face
of Beijing's intransigence on
democratic reforms.
The Hong Kong protests
reminded Taiwanese voters of
what Taiwan could become in
the event of unification with
China, said Kweibo Huang,
associate professor of diploma-
cy at National Chengchi Uni-
versity in Taipei.
"Hong Kong consolidated
Taiwan voter worries about
relations with mainland
China," Huang said.
The DPP won seven of nine
races for mayors and county
chiefs, delivering a major set-
back to the ruling Nationalist
Party, which advocates greater
economic integration across the
Taiwan Strait.
That poses a complex chal-
lenge for Beijing, which claims
Taiwan as part of its territory
and has vowed to take control
of the island by force if neces-
sary. The poll results build on
months of opposition among
the young and middle class to
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-
jeou's steps to further reduce
economic barriers between the
sides and propel them toward
talks on political unification.

Concerns in Hong Kong that
the economic rise of mainland
China marginalizes the former
British colony also are high
among the pro-democracy pro-
testers there. Likewise in Tai-
wan, many residents fea the
island's economy could be swal-
lowed up by China, flooding its
labor market to keep wages low
as living costs rise.
"Ma Ying-jeou's policies
don't seem to be producing a
trickle-down effect. Voters had
the feeling that, today Hong
Kong, tomorrow Taiwan," said
Joseph Cheng, an expert on
Chinese politics at City univer-
sity of Hong Kong.
Beijing has limited room to
adjust to changes in Taiwan
and Hong Kong, given its fears
of stoking pro-democracy sen-
timent at home and its long-
established positions on the
two territories.
It has long pushed for Tai-
wan to accept the "one country,
two systems" policy it negoti-
ated for Hong Kong when it
was returned by Britain in 1997,
which allows the city some
autonomy and a separate eco-
nomic and judicial system, but
places it firmly under Beijing's
ultimate authority.

fth Demand:Giving
vors the option to have
rpetrators expelled
is time, the Student Sex-

ual Misconduct Policy allows for
the "permanent separation," or
expulsion, of individuals found
guilty of violations of the policy,
following results of a University
review panel. While survivors of
sexual assault may provide input
to the panel, they do not make the
final decision about whether or
not the accused party is expelled.
The policy also states that the
accused perpetrator is assumed
to be innocent unless sufficient
evidence is presented to the panel
provinghis or her violations.
Schlissel said he agrees with
the current policy as it regards
this particular issue, citing this
demand as one of the twp he took
issue with - the other being the
second demand imposing specific
requirements on fraternities and
sororities.
"The survivors of assault ask
that they have, in effect, the rights
to determine results and the pun-
ishment, and I think that is way
tougher," Schlissel said. "I think
that the University has to retain
the right to develop policies and
find ways to ensure the safety of
survivors - the physical and psy-
chological safety of survivors -
but to define what the University
must do in hypothetical future
circumstances is tough to do."
SAPAC student volunteer
Laura Meyer, an LSA senior, said
she believes there is no single
change that could be made that
would significantly decrease
occurrences of sexual assault on
campus.
"It's not like we can change one
policy and make a difference,"
Meyer said. "It's a cultural prob-
lem, and sexual violence is just
normalized within the culture so
we do a lot already just to combat
that."
Sixth Demand: Increased
support for survivors
SAPAC offers a variety of
options for survivors, but this
demand asserts that these options
are insufficient and are not widely
advertised.
Rider-Milkovich said she
hopes to hear from students what
exactly is missing from SAPAC's
current program, but said many of
the resources that students might
want are already in place.
"I think there are a lot of
resources SAPAC does offer that
students just don't know about,"
she said. "We always need to be
talking to survivors about what
ways you would feel supported
effectively."
SAPAC has also expressed
interest in exploring continuing
education programs for students
beyond the training they receive
during their first year at the Uni-
versity.
Rider-Milkovich said
SAPAC's research indicates the
impact of the messages con-
veyed to incoming students
begins to diminish after their
first year on campus.
As a student volunteer, Mad-
dock said she focuses on provid-
ing education and preventative
measures for students on campus,
adding that SAPAC's professional
staff, which includes a handful of

individuals with the appropriate
qualifications, interacts with and
helps survivors.
"On our professional staff, we
have four permanent staff that
can do advocacy and all of that
work," Maddock said. "Hav-
ing that many people, we could
always have more. Having more
people on hand to support sur-
vivors would really be helpful,
because at our survivor center, I
think having more people avail-
able would help them get the best
care possible, and we are trying
to do that now with the limited
resources we have."
Seventh Demand: Recognition
ofstudentvoices
The final demand called for
all student perspectives to be
included in conversations about
sexual assault, including those
from underrepresented commu-
nities on campus. Students have
some impact on the types of pro-
grams administered toincoming
students in the form of Relation-
ship Remix, which is at its core a
peer-based program. Paid staff
members oversee the Relation-
ship Remix programs, and stu-
dent volunteers can discuss their
concerns and ideas, which are
reviewed by SAPAC staff mem-
bers. -
This demand suggests a need
for SAPAC staff and the voices
being heard to adequately rep-
resent different communities on
campus.
SAPAC student volunteers have
yet to see any action in response to
these demands. Meyer said some
of the demands she read seemed
unreasonable, and while she said
SAPAC is continually striving to
improve, none of the improve-
ments she mentioned were related
to the suggestions made by this
anonymous group.
"I don't know who was
involved, but if I remember cor-
rectly, taking steps like that, small
things, to make a difference, I
think the University should con-
sider student ideas like that,"
Meyer said. "I don't think all of
them are reasonable, but I think
the University should consider
taking small steps like that.'
Schlissel calls for better educa-
tion about services available
University President Mark
Schlissel responded to the protest
during a Nov. 4 interview with
The Michigan Daily, emphasizing
the need for improvedprocedures
regarding the handling of sexu-
al assault on campus. Schlissel
added that the University needs
to commit to better informing the
public about progress in this area.
While he applauded the
passion of the group responsible
for the list of demands, Schlissel
said he felt the ways those
students chose to convey their
thoughts and ideas were not
conducive to developing a
dialogue about the subject of
sexual assault on campus.
"The one thing I will object
to, which drives me a little nutty,
is framing things as demands,"
Schlissel said. "I think that
makes it really difficult to have
discussions."

a successful resolution to direct
City Administrator Steve Powers to
revise the city's Freedom of Infor-
mation Act policy, which provides
a guide to making records available
to the public. In early 2013, Pow-
ers provided revisions to the city's
policy regarding release of public
documents. Along with these revi-
sions, Dave Askins, former-editor of
The Ann Arbor Chronicle, which no

tothe draftrevisions in2013.
Along with its efforts to revise the
policy, the Michigan Legislature con-
sidered multiple amendments to the
MichiganFOIA during2013 and 2014,
butno changes were adopted aslaw.
"In keeping with the Republi-
can legislature, they didn't really
accomplish anything on those
points,"Eatonsaid. "Ithinkit'stime
for us to revisit our FOIA policies."
The city resolution permits
Powers to "renew his efforts" to
revise the release of public docu-

transparency. Some members have
expressed interest in a policy that
would waive fees for the media,

Organ donation efforts. often
extend beyond campus. For exam-
ple, Tislerics said the University
library system began to host donor
registration days at its buildings.
This initiative later spred to
other college and public libraries
throughout the state.
"We love working with U of M,"
Tislerics said. "Between the health
system, student groups and Athlet-
ic Department, everyone has been
so supportive of saving lives."
While 79 people receive organ

130 npw bone marrow donors

portion of the meeting, Ann Arbor
resident Katherine Wilkerson dis-
cussed the fatal shooting of Aura
Rosser by Ann Arbor police on Nov.
9 and argued that the Ann Arbor
Police Department was not entirely
transparent in the aftermath.
"Now, 22 days after its awful
occurrence, the continuing secrecy
surrounding this homicide is an
affront to the people and to prin-
ciples of democracy and justice,"
Wilkerson said.
Wilkerson cited the fact that in
the Ferguson, Mo. incident, Darren
Wilson, the police officer who shot
and killed Michael Brown, a Black,
allegedly unarmed teenager, was
identified six days after the shooting.
"The standard excuse for con-
cealing the identities of cops that
kill citizens is for the safety of the
cops," Wilkerson said. "Michigan's
Freedom of Information law allows
that, but only supported by substan-
tialjustificationandexplanation,not
merely by conclusive reassertions."
Even though Wilkerson said she
knows Michigan's FOIA law can
conceal the identity of a police offi-
cer with justification and explana-
tory support, she asked the Council
what such justificationexists fornot
identifying the officer in this par-
ticular case.
"What substantial justification
and explanation exists to maintain
the secrecy of the officers involved
in the killing of Rosser?" Wilkerson
said. "Is this what Chief (John) Seto
means whenhetoutsthe importance

SUNDAI JOHNSONI H(I_ A
Letter to the revolutionaries

The next social injustice

ve never fully understood
football. I don't know if it was
for lack of interest or because
it just seemed
too complicated,
but I admittedly
never tried to
comprehend it.
I don't mean the
mechanics of the x
game (although
I'm a little hazy {
on those details,
too), I mean the MAURA
phenomenon LWINE
of American
football: the
reason we play it
(i.e. obsess over it) as an American
society despite its proven dangers.
It's like smoking cigarettes. We
know it's bad and it just might kill
us, but people choose to gamble and
do it anyway because it feels good.
Just for writing this position peo-
ple will label me too-girly-to-under-
stand. Perhaps that is true. But yet
again the liberal banner exulting the
dangers of football must be raised
and repeated, for otherwise I fear
the imminent decay of our society
into a caveman world of oblivion.
Let's start with the most recent,
horrifying football news. On Sun-
day afternoon Ohio State football
player Kosta Karageorge was found
dead. He reportedly shot himself in
the head after suffering numerous
concussions thanks in part to his
beloved sport, football. Right before
he was last seen, he texted his mom,
"I am sorry if I am an embarrass-
ment but these concussions have
my head all f***ed up." Karageorge
was a walk-on to the Ohio State
football team after having wrestled
for three years. CNN reported his
death with an opening line of, "The
rough sports he loved may have

helped to do Kosta Karageorge in at
age 22." This simple, matter-of-fact
statement is about as hype a reper-
cussion as his death may receive.
There will be no riots or protests for
Karageorge. There will be no Fer-
guson fury. We have accepted as an
American society that the pleasure
we derive from watching young
men hurl themselves at one another
across a field of grass is worth more
than the death of a few or the brain
injury of hundreds. In fact, we teach
our little boys that strong, able, suc-
cessful men play football. We turn
a blind eye to the casualties as we
continue to pour money and effort
into a sport that does nothing for the
good of mankind.
Michael Brown, the victim of
the Ferguson shooting, was 18. His
needless death has been protested
for months and has brought this
country damn near to its knees. It's
all you hear about when you turn on
the news. That's because of what it
stands for. Brown's death stands
for the injustice and the racism
that still plague our society. He's a
cause people can rally around. But
what about Karageorge? What does
his mom feel like? He was only four
years older than Brown. He died
needlessly, too. No one is protesting
for him. Yes, he will receive well-
deserved candlelight vigils and a
school-wide grievance, but will
anyone question the institution of
football? Will anyone research the
statistics of how many football ath-
letes are injured or die from concus-
sions? Will anyone cry for an end to
this constant violence like they did
in Ferguson? I'll just go ahead and
take a guess. No.
And here we find ourselves back
to the slippery slope that is former
Athletic Director Dave Brandon and
the University of Michigan football

program. Why, you may ask, do
we refuse to question football and
why do we refuse to make our
players safer? Money. Yes, we're a
society that will do anything for
money. Dave Brandon himself made
$850,000 in 2013 while working
at the University. That made him
the highest-paid employee of the
University. So somewhere, someone
decided that Michigan football,
with all of its concussions and
sexual abuse scandals, was more
important than the University
cancer researcher with a Ph.D. on
North Campus who spends over 12
hours a day in a lab trying to find a
cure for breast cancer. But that is
neither here nor there.
Money, then, is what drives this
train. While people run to burn
things down and -throw rocks at
policemen over the death of Michael
Brown, they leave NFL football
playingonthe TVathome,forgetting
that the.Super Bowl represents the
single largest human trafficking
incident in the United States each
year. People rush* off to protest
violence, while supporting violence
(without even knowing it). Here's
the boys-will-be-boys part I really
don't understand: we're letting
football and all of its atrocities
fly because we find it relaxing
to watch young men break each
other's legs and tackle one another
to the ground? I think I missed
something. Perhaps in another 50
years Ferguson will be a story of
the distant past. People will rejoice
in a newfound equality between
all races. Football, then, will be the
next injustice and violent theme
we protest in this country. One can
only hope.

NICHOLAS RAJA I
A new approach to student mental health concerns

This piece was originally posted on Facebook
in reaction to the grand jury's decision that
Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson would
not be indicted in the death of teenager Michael
Brown. It has since been revised for publication
in The Michigan Daily.
I am usually not one to use Facebook as a
platform to share my own voice. I might repost
things I find funny or exciting, artistic and
beautiful, reassuring. Repost about issues that
are relevant and important that reflect my,
thinking and beliefs, but when it comes to my
own voice on this particular platform, I have
been silent.
But tonight, on this grave night, when my,
hands and heart tremble, there is no other time
that might merit a greater reason to speak out
than this.
We all know what happened months ago.
We all know what happened tonight. We are all
reactingin some capacity.
I'm thankful for the voices that resonate with
my own, the words Ican snap to. It reminds me
that I am not alone, that we are not alone. That
we matter.
And while I am hurt and angered by those
voices that are dead set that this man is
innocent, that this circumstance is not about
race, these arguments are irrelevant to the
matter and not only is there no room to discuss
this, there is negative room to discuss this.
Then there are those who believe they are
not reacting at all. Those who have the power
and privilege to look away. I would just like
to say that your passivity might be the biggest
reaction of them all. Neutrality is the greatest
threatto a world that might one day be just and
free to all. This silence perpetuates a system in
which accountability and responsibility are not
required and tells those who believe that this is
anything less than a tragedythat they are right.
There is no more room for passivity and
complacency. There is no'neutral'where human
rights are concerned, only responsibility.
This is not the time to police and criticize
the reactions of a people beaten and broken
down by a system in a country and society
built on their backs and their blood. And
please spare me arguments about how slavery
is irrelevant. The institution of slavery helped

create a system where Black bodies are seen
as subhuman and where unlawful Black death
is justified, rewarded and upheld. socially,
institutionally and politically. This is the mess
slavery - and the violent distorted thinking
and bloody actions that produced it - made.
We'll stop talking about it when its residual
effects are cleaned up.
Tonight I am ill with sadness and trauma. I
believed that maybe we might have made it a
little farther than we'd come before.
I am pained to admit that I was sorely
mistakenandamnowperplexedbythis massive
question of where we go from here. What do we
do now?
I may - we may - have been wrong in
thinking our justice system would move away
from its haunting history and surprise us
with hope for the future, but I believe I am
right about one thing: This time is different.
The difference not being in a system that
consistently fails us - but the difference
being in a people tired of being failed. We
have changed; we are the difference; we have
the power to be the change.
This cannot be put to bed. They wanted us
to forget but we cannot allow them to bury us,
to bury this. We must keep organizing, keep
speaking, yelling, screaming, until we are
heard. Marching, stomping, pounding, shaking
the ground until the system has no choice but

The weekend of Nov. 14, 35
University students from across
campus came together at the
Colombiere Conference and Retreat
Center in Clarkston, Michigan to
receive training as group leaders
in anticipation of next semester's
kickoff of the Wolverine Support
Network, a University-wide ini-
tiative to promote student mental
health and wellness. ISwill add, as a
caveat, that ISwill be working as one
of these group leaders myself.
According to its mission state-
ment, the WSN aims to become "the
first sustainable peer to peer led
structure at the University of Mich-
igan." This network will provide
another way for students who are
struggling with issues impacting
their mental well-being to express
their concerns and generate cathar-
sis. It's important to note that WSN
will be available to all University
students, and participants need not
have been formally diagnosed with
a mental health condition. The pro-
gram's inception originated with
Public Policy senior Bobby Dishell,
current CSG president, as one of
the key components of his and LSA
junior Meagan Shokar's 2014 Make
Michigan campaign platform. Both
he and Shokar felt that the issue
of student mental health was not
being given adequate attention,
and indeed, data collected by the
University seem to support such
a conclusion.
A College Student Mental Health
Survey conducted by the Univer-
sity's Counseling and Psychological
Services in 2010 reported several
striking statistics. Of the 2,358 stu-
dents surveyed, approximately one
in four noted that mental health
issues had caused problems in their
academics. Thirteen percent admit-
ted to having inflicted non-suicidal
self-injury, and 40.3 percent had
been impacted in some way by a
traumatic event, with females,
LGB individuals (no data were
reported for students identifying
as transgender or queer), Latin@s,
African-Americans and multira-
cial individuals experiencing the
highest prevalence of traumatic
experience. Furthermore, 74 per-
cent of participants voiced general
concern about their ability to suc-
ceed academically, and 73 percent
expressed some level of dissatisfac-
tion with their weight.
Despite their high prevalence
among college students, mental
health conditions continue to be
heavily stigmatized in the United
States as a whole. In 2007, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion reported that "only 25 percent
of adults with mental health symp-
toms believed that people are car-
ing and sympathetic to persons
with mental illness," suggesting

that there exists a profound fear
of the judgment or ostracism that
may result from being diagnosed
with mental health symptoms. This
stigma is what the Wolverine Sup-
port Network hopes to erase from
the University campus.
"I see ... a place where all niches
of campus come to create a new
culture of the University," said one
WSN group leader.
Beginning in January 2015,
interested students will be placed
in groups of 12 to 15 of their peers,
along with a pair of student lead-
ers. Throughout the semester
these groups will meet weekly to
confidentially address and support
the varying needs of their mem-
bers. Students will be placed with
students they've never met, in an
attempt to allow free speech with-
out fear of judgment from their
friends. It's not therapy, and it's
not counseling. It's a safe space
for University students to gather
together with others who come
from a diversity of backgrounds, in
order to share their struggles, their
triumphs or any issue that they
would like to address. Further-
more, every other Friday, members
of all groups will participate in a
large group activity, so that people
have the opportunity to get to know
other members of the WSN in a fun
and relaxing setting. Activities may
include anything from group yoga
sessions or guided meditation to
outings to different venues around
Ann Arbor. The network has been
months in the making and remains
an ever-evolving entity. As part
of the leader retreat, student lead-
ers were encouraged to critically
examine the structure of the pro-
gram, to create together something
that would become an integral part
of University culture moving into
the future. As a participant in the
weekend, I found it to be a trans-
formative experience, and I think
many of my co-leaders would say
the same.
Another WSN group lead-
er said, "It will provide a home
away from home for people who
are struggling."
In order to build trust among
those in attendance, the first night
was dedicated to getting to know
one another and sharing thoughts
about or our connections to mental
health. I was deeply moved by the
experiences of my peers, many of
whom have been impacted in some
way by traumatic or painful expe-
riences, including suicide, abuse,
depression and anxiety, among
many others. Equally moving were
the stories of those who, despite
no apparent connection to mental
health issues in their lives, felt so
passionately about the topic and
believed so strongly in the mission

of the Wolverine Support Network.
"It'll become a great community
through which students can meet
new people and bounce ideas off
of one another in a safe, inclusive,
and action-oriented environment."
- WSN group leader
The entirety of Saturday was
spent on leader education. Experts
from CAPS, the University's Sexual
Assault Prevention and Aware-,
ness Center, Wolverine Wellness
and University Housing's Diversity
Educationprogram gave lectures on
a wide range of topics. As a group,
we learned about the prevalence of
depression and anxiety on college
campuses, and how to recognize
signs that a person might be con-
templating suicide. We received
instruction on how to best pro-
vide support to survivors of sexual
assault and how to make them
aware of the numerous resources
available to them on campus. Addi-
tionally, we were taught about the
ways in which substance abuse
can impact student life and how to
maintain a comfortable environ-
ment for individuals of every race,
color, ethnicity, national origin, sex,
gender identity, sexual orientation,
disability status, age and religion.
Though our education was, of
course, not exhaustive, it pro-
vided a solid framework from
which to proceed. Furthermore,
it was emphasized that we were
not mental health profession-
als and should be prepared to
direct students to appropriate
campus resources. Leaders will
continue to receive training on a
variety of health topics throughout
the semester.
"It will aid in de-stigmatizing
mental health" - WSN group leader
Sunday was spent working as
a group to define what we really
wanted the Wolverine Support Net-
work to become. I found that every-
one had a unique vision for the
future of the initiative. The most
common themes focused on simply
creating a community, one where
everyone on campus would - feel
safe, included and valued, and one
that would continue to develop and
change just like our diverse student
body. That afternoon, 35 people
who had been strangers less than
72 hours before stepped off the bus
by the Union as friends, energized
and optimistic about the future of
mental health at the University.
If you or anyone you know
might be interested in joining a
WSN group next semester, please

FILM REM-iE
'Horrible Bosses 2'
a mediocre sequel

Follow-up to
successful comedy
falls short of original
By CONRAD FOREMAN
DailyArts Writer
While "Horrible Bosses 2"
doesn't exceed expectations,it's at
least passable.
In the
follow-up C
to the 2011
success Horrible
"Horrible Bosses 2
Bosses,"
Nick (Jason Rave 20 and
Bateman, Quality 16
"Bad Words"), Warner Bros.
Kurt (Jason
Sudeikis, "We're the Millers")
and Dale (Charlie Day, "Going
the Distance") once again find
themselves on the raw end of a
business deal. Though they have
freed themselves from their
tormenting bosses, the trio's
venture into self-employment
seems destined to end in
disaster when a super-wealthy
businessman (Christoph Waltz,
"Inglourious Basterds") reneges
on his deal to fund the group's
patented product. This time
around, murder won't do the trick;
so Nick, Kurt and Dale kidnap
their foe's son (Chris Pine, "Star
Trek"), intending to hold him for
ahandsome ransom.
The plot weaves its way
through encounters with
familiar faces from the first film,
creating a scenario in which
the gang must seek advice
from Nick's imprisoned former
boss (Kevin Spacey, "American
Beauty"), as well as fan favorite,
"Motherfucker" Jones (Jamie
Foxx, "Django Unchained"). In

A nightmare dressed like a daydream.
order to pull off the kidnapping,
the trio setsout to steal laughing
gas from Dale's old office, which
leads to a raunchy and open-
minded encounter between
Nick and Dale's former boss, an
insatiable sex-addict portrayed
by Jennifer Aniston ("We're
the Millers'). While certainly
forced for the sake of bringing
back as many characters as
possible, these run-ins with
the first film's villains and
accomplices account for many
laughs, especially in any dealings
with "Motherfucker" Jones.
The film skates over some
important plot points, like the
details of the business deals that
led to the group's impending
demise. That's to be expected,
but delivering that segment
of the story via montage with
Macklemore's "Can't Hold
Us" pumping though theaters'
speakers feels rushed and out-of-
place, alazy delivery ofexposition.
Though the film relies on a
formulaic structure, "Horrible
Bosses 2" takes unexpected risks

WARNER BROS
with many of its jokes. During
the opening sequence at a local
news station, the boys promote
Nick-Kurt-Dale, which sounds
awfully a lot like a certain racial
slur. The film attempts racial
humor throughout, beyond just
the shock-value of the N-word,
though results are hit-and-miss.
Some moments in the film leave
one wondering how many writers
it took to pull this crap out of the
toilet, such as when Kurt and Dale
partake in silhouetted oral sex, an
age-old gag carried out with more
creativity in the second and third
"Austin Powers" movies.
Not withoutits flaws, "Horrible
Bosses 2" resides right in the
middle of the pack - it's not
a sequel that had to be made,
nor is it one that surpasses
its predecessor - but the
film employs great comedic
talent around an entertaining
premise and should make fans
of the first film laugh, at least a
few times. No major complaints
here, unless this leads to
"Horrible Bosses 3."

Bateman, Day and
Sudekis discuss
making the sequel
By REBECCA LERNER
DailyArts Writer
Despite receiving mediocre
reviews, "Horrible Bosses" seeks
to be anything but horrible.
And the film's leading trio hope
moviegoersthink the same.
In a recent conference call
The Michigan Daily attended,
Jason Bateman ("This is
Where I Leave You"), Charlie
Day ("It's Always Sunny in
Philadelphia") and Jason
Sudeikis ("We're the Millers")
discussed their anticipation
for the sequel to their wildly
successful "Horrible Bosses."
The first installment focused
on the three friends hoping to
solve their unfortunate work
situations with an extreme
Solution: killing each other's
bosses. The raucous comedy
performed well critically and
financially, but is that enough
to warrant a sequel?
The stars of the film think so.
In the call, they acknowledged
the huge financial incentive for
a second film, since "Horrible
Bosses" grossed about $210
million worldwide.
"You get asked to do sequels
when it makes enough money

to warrant it, " Bateman said.
"(We were all) certainly open
to it ... we had such a good time
doing the first one."
Day elaborated on the
considerations they made to
to endure the sequel would be
worth it.
"Creatively, I think we got it
to a place where it made sense
for us to do it." Day said.
The sequel certainly has
the groundwork for the same
raunchy excellence of the first
movie. There are some familiar'
faces, with Jennifer Aniston
("We're the Millers") andJamie
Foxx ("Django Unchained")
reprising their roles as sex-
crazed dentist Dr. Julia
Harris and murder consultant
Dean "Motherfucker" Jones,
respectively. But the stars'
excitement stemmed from the
expansion of the cast to include
new villains Chris Pine ("Star
Trek Into Darkness") and two-
time Oscar winner Christoph;
Waltz ("Django Unchained")..
"It's pretty cool when you
can class (a comedy) up with
some Oscar winners." Bateman
said. "It becomes a really nice
balanced cocktail."
Sudeikis said, it's "flattering"
for actors to join the series due
to the success of the first film.
Beyond additions to the cast,
Sean Andrew, who directed
Sudeikis in "We're the Millers"
took the directorial role over

Seth Gordon, the first film's
director.
"Him and his writing partner,
John Morris; are ... two of the
best ... scriptwriters, comic
writers in ... Hollywood right
now," Sudeikis said.
"The film got a little more
stylized ... and it fits the story,"
Day agreed.
And for Bateman he's yet
to work with a horrible boss,
despite his fictional experiences
then.
"I'm waiting for a real son
of a bitch to come my way. I'm
prepped," said Jason Bateman
on if he had ever had a horrible
boss. Although he neglected
to name anyone-specific, with
"Horrible Bosses 2," he's had
plenty of fictional experience
with them.
These actors are well-
versed with the cynicism of
the American public and did
their best to make a film that
would match the expectations
-moviegoers would have of the
funnytrio.
"We didn't want to make a
film that was not at least as
good as the first film, gnd we
worked really, really hard to
attempt to do that," Bateman
said.
"I expect people to be
skeptical and I hope that
they're pleasantly surprised,"
Day added. "(I'm) hopeful that
they're really going to like it."

STYLE NOT EBOK
Supporting the look
good, feel good' mantra

By CAROLINE FILIPS
Daily Arts Writer
I'm an ardent supporter
of the "look good, feel good"
mantra, and "dress well, test
well" is a close second, or at
least ... it used to be. Though
I may have planned a few
outfit/accessory combina-
tions the night before I took
the ACT in high school (con-
vinced the mysticism of the
right clothing combinations
brought me to the University)
the motivation to look effort-
lessly put-together becomes
more difficult to muster in
college and I often find myself
sporting last night's pajamas
when I take my exams.
I surely don't feel my best
when my friends can't tell
if they're eating lunch with
an undercover bag lady or
their friend who aspires to
eventually cultivate a yup-
pie lifestyle - complete with
a perfectly tailored Bergdorf
Goodman wardrobe. Perhaps
it's easier to express how
you feel on the outside than
explain how the stress of two
exams catalyzed an existen-
tial crisis, resulting in your
surrender to sweatpants.
So has the confidence I
used to draw from clothing
faded throughout my limited
college career? Absolutely. I
quickly succumbed to a new
lethargic lifestyle, constant
hunger for anything that can
be delivered directly to my
bedside and productivity con-
trasted by equal amounts of
laziness. And because of that,
I no longer considered my
outward appearance a prior-
ity. Yet I yearned for that lost
confidence, that feeling of
knowing I used to dress some-
what decently and reflecting
it in my mood.
Though it may not be

fit choices, I still believe in

In defense of the saxophone
and its revival in pop music

By CARLY SNIDER
Daily Arts Writer
Take a moment and imagine
the coolest, most jam-worthy
instrument you can think of.
Is it a hard-rocking electric
guitar? A piano? Drums, pos-
sibly? For me, it might have to
be the saxophone. Yes, saxo-
phone, as in that Kenny G guy.
In the past, the saxophone has
been reserved for background
music at stuffy dinner parties
or the soundtrack to torturous
car rides with parents who
refuse to change the radio
station from the smooth jazz
station. But with its incor-
poration into more modern
music, the stigma of the saxo-
phone is slowly being erased.
Pop artists such as Katy
Perry, Jason Derulo, Lady
Gaga and Pitbull have all
featured the saxophone on
some of their most successful
tracks, with Kenny G himself
making a cameo in Perry's
"Last Friday Night." The mil-
lennials have embraced the
sax. Using new editing tech-
niques to change or enhance
the sound, listeners may not
even be aware of the real
instrumentation behind some
of their favorite hits. Often-
times the sax replaces what
used to be the entirely elec-
tronic drop or bridge to the
song. Working with the same
medium, comparing Pitbull's
party anthem "Fireball" to

nevertheless showcases the
band's vitality and ability
to soldier on through tough
times.
The name of' the game
for AC/DC has always
been consistency, and this
holds true on Rock or Bust.
Rather than try to dabble
in contemporary styles, the
group has again stuck with
the tried-and-true formula of
povwer chords, nimble single-
note riffs, Angus Young's
searing guitar solos and
irreverent party-time lyrics
delivered by the husky-voiced
Brian Johnson. The creative
well has dried a bit (as it
does when any band passes
its 40th year), meaning there
are no songs on Rock or Bust
on par with classics such as
"Highway to Hell" or "Back
in Black." There are no
instantly recognizable riffs
and the predominantly mid-
tempo songs blend together.
But what the tracks lack_
in originality, they make
up for in volume, energy
and fun, and with each one
clocking under four minutes,
the album works perfectly
as a quick jolt of musical
adrenaline - the musical
equivalent of black coffee.
The group does not
explicitly mention the
Young's struggle or
delinquent Rudd in lyrical
form, but there are subtle
nods to the trying times that
have colored the album's
production. The cheery
major-key romp "Rock the
Blues Away" has a tinge of
melancholy, as the narrator
takes solace in his car, his
friends and his girl to try
and forget his troubles. The
slow, groovy "Hard Times"
is the closest thing Rock
or Bust has to a mission
statement, featuring a lyrical
call for downtrodden folks
everywhere to rise above
their circumstances (plus
some of the dirtiest lead
guitar that Angus Young has
ever played.) The album's
title track affirms the band's
belief that their commitment
to rock 'n' roll will help them
overcome present and future
challenges: "In rock we trust
/ It's rock or bust." Elsewhere
on the record, the band fully
embraces the sex and violence
rock is known for, from the
very direct carnality of"Rock
the House" to the juvenile
humor of "Emission Control,"
from the menace and doom of
"Dogs of War" to the defiant
F-you to mortality of "Play
Ball," the album's lead single.
The album's greatest
strengthisnotinits individual

songs, but its classic AC/DC
sound. New rhythm guitarist
Stevie Young has mastered
his retired uncle Malcolm's
sound and technique,
establishing himself as a
capable replacement, and the
veterans of the band are in
top form. Malcolm Young's
presence is strong on the
record (he holds co-writing
credit on all eleven tracks),
as is the rhythm section of
Phil Rudd and bassist Cliff
Williams (Rudd completed
his parts before his legal
troubles began). Producer
Brendan O'Brien eschews
studio reverb and effects,
preferring an unpolished
production approach that
allows the grit and spirit of
the performances to shine
through. Each cut captures
the camaraderie and sense of
fun that the band members
share, proving that AC/DC is
no standard-issue corporate
rock band, but a family: a
band of brothers bonded by
music.
This familial bond has kept
the band from getting too
personal with its music, out
of respect for the privacy of
Young and Rudd. As such, the
lyrical content is superficial
- had AC/DC featured
more explicit references
to its struggles, the album
certainly would have been
more emotionally gripping,
and would have displayed a
never-before-heard sensitive
side of the band. But AC/DC's
mission has always been to
provide entertainment, not to
tug on peopie's heartstrings.
Plus, exploiting the suffering
of Young and Rudd for
commercial and artistic
purposes would be cheap
and disrespectful. While this
impersonality makes for a
weaker album, it shows that
the group has something that
is often overlooked in the
rock world: integrity.
Most rock bands don't make
it past 10 years of life, so it's a
wonder AC/DC has survived
this long. The group's future
is undoubtedly uncertain, but
if Rock or Bust turns out to
be its final album, it will be a
fine capstone to over 40 years
of rocking and rolling. It is a
derivative album, a retread of
ideas that the band has been
recycling since day one. But it
is also a raucous celebration
of life, and most importantly,
it is a rock album that sounds
incredibly good. When faced
with the decision to rock or
to bust, AC/DC have chosen
once again to rock. Angus,
Malcolm, Stevie, Brian, Cliff,1
Phil ... we salute you.

MEN' SLAROSSE
Wolverines greet
young teammate

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
a With 4:41 remaining in the
Michigan hockey team's game
against Rensselaer on Saturday,
fifth-year senior goaltender
Luke Dwyer made his entry into
the crease.
Yost Ice Arena erupted' as he
skated from the bench to the
goal frame. Dwyer, a third-string
goaltender and a former walk-
on, doesn't get to play much,
especially when he's behind two
goaltenders capable of starting on
most teams in the country.
But this was Dwyer's moment,
and it didn't come without
pressure. Though the Wolverines
helda6-Olead overthe Engineers,
they were searching for their first
shutout since Nov. 22, 2013.
Dwyer had had his first
opportunity to impress his
hometown fans once before, but
nothing went as planned.
Just less than a year ago,
on Dec. 5, 2013, Dwyer made
his first-ever appearance in a
Michigan sweater during an
exhibition game against the
United States Under-18 National
Team DevelopmentProgram.
With less than three minutes
left in regulation, Dwyer made
the same entrance he did
Saturday night. Yost cheered, his
teammates smiled and tapped
their sticks on the boards. It was
all shaping up to be a special
evening for Dwyer, a lifelong
resident of Ann Arbor.
Michigan was leading 4-2, and
there really wasn't a weight of
demand on Dwyer's shoulders.
Just stand tall between the pipes
for 180 seconds and call it a night.
"That was something the
captains talked to (Michigan
coach) Red (Berenson) at the
beginning of the week, about
getting him in if we had a lead,"
said former Michigan forward
Alex Guptill at the time.
His friends playing in front of
him seemed to already have the
win deep in their pocket. The U.S.
NTDP made things interesting,

though, netting a goal with 52
seconds remaining.
Fans became uneasy, shifting
in their seats. Berenson wasn't
pleased with conceding a late
goal. He never is.
Then, 28 seconds later, a
Michigan player and a member of
the U.S. NTDP both bumped into
Dwyer. A puck was rising, coming
toward the Wolverine net. It was
a save Dwyer would make nine
times out of 10 in practice.
But the contact from the two
players in the crease pushed
Dwyer to the side, and he was
forced to scramble back into
position. Before he could, a
seemingly harmless backdoor
pass ended up in the back of the
net.
It was a 4-4 game. Yost was
silent. The players were left in
shock.
Just 2:43 into the overtime
session, Michigan conceded a
third unanswered goal. It lost,
5-4, and all three goals were
conceded after Dwyer came in,
ready for his shining moment.
"I've got a sick feeling in my
stomach right now for us to blow
that lead for him," Guptill said.
"It's pretty bad. Dwyer is the
definition of a Michigan Man;
he's worked out really hard and
earned every opportunity out
there."
That's why Saturday's game
was a shot at redemption. A few
gracious minutes awarded to
Dwyer, a guy who, according to
Berenson, "does everything right
and cares about the team like it's
his own family."
It was Dwyer's chance to put
his first - and only - appearance
aside and build a different legacy
with the block 'M' on his chest.
And it was a chance for the rest of
his team to fight like hell to make
sure another cherished moment
wasn't tarnished.
"I was obviously extremely
excited to be in. Excited, nervous,
a wide range of emotions,"
Dwyer said.
He was tested immediately.
Dwyer made a nice save with

interim Athletic Director Jim Hackett is the sole determiner of Hoke's fate.
"We have a football coach who
has had a long history of being a
good coach. He knows we're not
where we need to be right now."
Jim Hackett on Nov. 22

Report,
Hackett to meet
with Hoke before 3
p.m. this afternoon
By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Editor
When Brady Hoke
walked through the lobby of
Schembechler Hall at about
11:45 a.m. Monday morning,
speculation about his job statua
swirled in the outside world.
But Hoke still seemed focused
on coaching football. A group
of his players stood conversing
in the entryway to the building,
and Hoke made sure to ask
them if they'd had the chance to
watch game film yet.
According to reports from
Sam Webb of Scout.com,
Tuesday will have a different
feel for Hoke. He will meet
with Interim Athletic Director
Jim Hackett before speaking
with his team at 3 p.m. during a
previously scheduled meeting.
According to Webb, it is
expected that a decision on
Hoke's future at Michigan will
be decided when the coach
meets with Hackett.
ESPN.com later corroborated
Webb's report.
When Hackett spoke with
media before the Wolverines'
game against Maryland on Nov.
22, he said he would conduct
an evaluation of the football
program at the "end of the
season," but declined to offer,
up further details as to when
exactly that evaluation process
would take place.
A Michigan spokesperson
could not confirm to the Daily
the meeting between Hackett
and Hoke.
If Hoke is relieved of his
duties Tuesday, Michigan will
owe him a buyout of $3 million.
If the decision to let him go
comes after Jan. 1, the buyout
drops to $2 million.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Michigan footballcoach BradyHoke will learn his fate ina meeting with Jim Hackett today, per Scout.com's Sam Webb.

207 E iberty, Ann Arbor

The meeting will come
three days after the end of the,
2014 football season in which
the Wolverines went 5'7 in
Hoke's fourth year leading the
program. After winning the
Sugar Bowl and going 11-2 in
Hoke's first season, his teams
have regressed each year.
After Saturday's loss to Ohio
State, Hoke offered few details
about his job status.
"What I know is I'm going
to be the football coach at
Michigan," Hoke said.
"It's what I know right now."
He'll know more tomorrow.
IN OTHER NEWS:
According to reports from
multiple media outlets, redshirt
sophomore running back Drake
Johnson tore his anterior
cruciate ligament after scoring
a touchdown in the third
quarter of Saturday's game.
