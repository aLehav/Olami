By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) announced Saturday morn-
ing that after 54 years of serving in
Congress, he plans to continue his
career with a reelection campaign
to represent Michigan's 15th dis-
trict.
';he announcement was made
during the University of Michi-
gan College Democrats's fifth
annual Pancake Breakfast at the
Arbor Brew-
ing Company First reported on
in downtown Michiga D aom
Ann Arbor.
The crowd at the packed restau-
rant included Ann Arbor Mayor
John Heiftje, State Rep. Rebekah
Warren (D-Ann Arbor) and State
R p. Pam Byrnes (D-Lyndon
Township).
In his speech, Dingell - who
is currently the longest serving
0 member of the House of Represen-

tatives - said after talking with his
wife and reflecting on past work,
he decided he is not ready to stop
pushing for the improvement and
progression of the state of Michi-
gan and the nation.
"I have given a great deal of

state and my people," Dingell said.
"The lovely Deborah and I have
spoken, and we have come to the
conclusion that it is not the time
for us to walk away."

ing some of his plans and goals for
his campaign and his term, if he's
reelected.
Dingell noted that he has wit-
nessed many economic downturns
in Michigan and the United States
over the course of his lifetime, and
that the current state of the econo-
my is something that must be dealt
with to prevent serious repercus-
sions.
"As a boy I went through the
Depression, and I've gone through
a number of recessions, but I've
never gone through a more diffi-
cult one since 1929 than this, and

Even without cafe,
students want lounge
to have former feel
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
Though East Quad Residence
Hall's Halfway Inn cafe - com-

monly referred to as "the Half-
ass"- closed at the beginning of
the school year, students within
East Quad are trying to bring the
alternative flare back to the space.
Rachel Sherman, a sophomore
in the Residential College, is lead-
ing an effort with the East Quad
Music Co-Op to revitalize the
spirit of the Halfway Inn, which
was transitioned from a cafe and

convenience store to a lounge. She
said the cafe was a special place
for East Quad residents and RC
students over the years, and she
wants to bring back the former
/atmosphere of the space, despite
the absence of its infamous cafe.
"This place had a lot of charac-
ter that I can't find in any other
cafe," Sherman said. "It really had
student sense to it."

Sherman said she hopes to rally
students in East Quad in support
of the cause, since many were
upset when University Housing
made little effort to collaborate
with them or discuss the closing
of the cafe.
"When they cleared the Half-
ass out, they didn't really seem to
consult, to ask any students what

Chinese institute with'U'
ties accused of cyberattacks

Google, other U.S.
companies were
targets of attacks
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
Various news outlets reported
that Shanghai Jiao Tong Universi-
ty in China - with which the Uni-
versity has shared a joint institute
in engineering since 2005 - may
be the source of recent cyberat-
tacks targeting Google and other

companies in the United States.
Last Thursday, The New York
Times reported that the cyber-
attacks have been traced to
computers at SJTU and Lanx-
iang Vocational School. SJTU is
known for its computer science
programs, while Lanxiang trains
some computer scientists for the
military, according to the article.
Despite the University's part-
nership with SJTU, University
officials say they have no new
information regarding the cyber-
attacks.
In early January, Google

announced that hackers had
accessed information from Gmail
accounts of Chinese human
rights activists in addition to
the accounts of 34 companies.
It is speculated that the hackers
were able to break through secu-
rity systems and obtain corporate.
data. In response to the attacks
Google shut down google.cn -
the version of Google made to
censor material as stipulated by
the Chinese government.
Yesterday, representatives
from SJTU and Lanxiang denied

Man exposes himself in Law Library

Viewing of 'Fight
Like Hell' starts
discussion about 'U'
racial climate
By CHELSEA LANGE
Daily StaffReporter
Alys Alley, external co-chair
of the Native American Student
Association, is on a mission to
spark dialogue among students
about the obstacles minorities face
on campus.

Alley, an LSA sophomore who
is a member of the Pokagon Band
of Potawatomi Indians, began
this dialogue last Friday at an
event called "Reflect, Remember,
Regroup." Alley led a discussion
with about 20 University stu-
dents in the multicultural lounge
in South Quadrangle Residence
Hall to talk about past and current
cultural barriers for minority stu-
dents.
Alley began the dialogue with
a movie called "Fight Like Hell,"
which describes the history of the
controversy surrounding the cam-
pus senior society Michigamua,

now officially called Order of
Angell, to show the difficulties
minority students and minority
groups face on campus.
Order of Angell is a senior honor
societyformed in 1902. The society
allegedly both used Native Ameri-
can artifacts as part of its pro-
ceedings and members spoke in a
dialect that mocked Native Ameri-
cans during group meetings.
In 2007, Michigamua was
renamed the Order of Angell and
has since remained mostly secre-
tive about its role on campus,
though it now releases the names

Multiple offenses
reported in e-mail
to law community
By ALEX KIRSHENBAUM
Daily StaffReporter
The Department of Pub-
lic Safety is looking for a man
accused of exposing himself
in the Law Library during two
recent weekends.
According to an e-mail sent
to the University Law School
community by David Baum,
the assistant dean and senior

manager of Student Affairs at
the Law School, the suspect
has exposed himself to female
students on at least two sepa-
rate occasions in the past few
weeks.
The man is described in the
e-mail' as a "medium- to dark-
complected black male in his
early 30's, 5'7",160 pounds (and)
bald, wearing a a brown ,coat,
black sweater, tan pants and a
brown or off green knit hat."
Both incidents occurred on
two recent Saturday afternoons
in the Law Library. Baum wrote
in the e-mail that each time, the
man "sat down near a female

law student at a study table, dis-
creetly and quietly pulled his
pants part of the way down his
legs and touched himself inap-
propriately."
Both times, the man left
the library when people in the
vicinity noticed his behavior,
according to the e-mail.
Baum also wrote in the e-mail
that the man did not assault the
female victims.
"In neither incident did he
overtly confront the student nor
behave in an aggressive manner
toward her," Baum wrote.
When contacted, Baum said

Western Michigan University
is thinking about relocating its
Archives and Regional History Col-
lections to a nearby Kmart, the West-
ern Herald reported, much to the
chagrin of some of the school's fac-
ulty and staff.
According to the article, West-
ern Michigan University students,
visiting scholars and local histori-
cal groups use the archives, which
attract 4,000 visitors a year. Some
faculty and staff in the history
department and the library system
say the move could hurt the school's
research efforts.
Though many are concerned about
the potential move, the article also
reported that the current location of
the archives hasn't been renovated
for 50 years.
With both locations getting nega-
tive feedback, WMU officials told the
Herald they are thinking about con-
structing a new building on campus
to house the archives.
"An architect has been chosen," Sha-

ron Carlson, the archives director,
told the Herald. "It is in the design
phase."
MALES LESS LIKELY TO TRY
FOR NON-PROFIT JOBS
Princeton Project 55 - an employ-
ment service that connects job-seeking
seniors and recent graduate students
from Princeton University with non-
profit organizations - reported that
three-quarters of its applicants for
the 2010-11 academic year are women,
according to an article in The Daily
Princetonian.
According to the article, the group
actively tries to advertise its services to
both men and women to close the gen-
der gap. The apparent gender gap is also
seen in other public service programs at
Princeton, including Teach for America,
which hopes to recruit more men into its
program, according to the article.
A spokeswoman for TFA told the Princ-
etonian that men maybe less inclinedto
apply to TFA or other service programs

because of "historical stereotypes
(about) pay, prestige and gender roles."
WYCLEF JEAN SET TO PUT ON
SA CONCERT AT HARVARD
Harvard University's Harvard Foun-
dation will be presenting Grammy
Award Winner Wyclef Jean with its 2010
Artist of the Year award at its Cultural
Rhythms show on Feb. 27, according to
an article in The Harvard Crimson.
The article reported that The Har-
vard Foundation wanted to present
the award to an artist that was an
active participant in society. Jean is a
native of Haiti and has been an active
force in helping Haiti deal with the
earthquake that took place on Jan.12.
"We look for people who have con-
tributed to society more than just their
talent in the arts," Elizabeth Eze, stu-
dent advisory committee secretary
for The Harvard Foundation, told the
Crimson. "We look for people who
have given back."

Authorities charge two men
in east Texas church fire

Ala. shooting suspect
brlliant, social misfit

Suspects believed to
have attended church
together
TYLER, Texas (AP) - Two
men who once attended church
together were charged yesterday
with intentionally burning down a
church in east Texas and are sus-
pected in a string of similar blazes,
authorities said.
Jason Robert Bourque, 19, and
21-year-old Daniel 'George McAl-

lister face one count of felony arson
for a church fire in rural Smith
County near Tyler, about 90 miles
east of Dallas, said Tom Crowley,
spokesman for the Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives.
Bond is set at $10 million apiece.
They could face life in prison if
convicted.
"Because they are charged with
one doesn't mean they're not going
to be charged with some of the oth-
ers," Crowley said.
Crowley and Smith County jail

officials said they had no informa-
tion on attorneys for either men.
Bourque, of nearby Lindale, was
arrested yesterday in Van Zandt
County, site of four of 10 church
fires in east Texas this year that
authorities believe were intention-
ally set, Crowley said.
McAllister was taken into cus-
tody in San Antonio, where Crow-
ley said he had recently moved.
He said Bourque and McAllister
used to attend First Baptist Church
in McAllister's hometown of Ben
Wheeler.

Preparing people to lead extraordinary lipves

Former neurobiology
professor charged
with opening fire
on colleagues
BOSTON (AP) - Amy Bishop's
intelligence was never debatable.
Even as a child, she didn't hesi-
tate to tell people when they were
wrong. As she grew older, earned
a Harvard Ph.D and claimed a
genius IQ of 180, her brilliance
could come with a bluntness,
condescension and volatile self-
righteousness.
It was all on display in 2002
when she yelled, "I am Dr. Amy
Bishop!" as she belted a woman
at a Massachusetts restaurant in
a fight over a child's booster seat.
Eight years later, the neurobi-
ologist was denied tenure at an
Alabama university, a failure her
husband and her attorney said
played a role in a shooting ram-
page that left three of Bishop's
colleagues dead and three others
injured.
Bishop's lawyer, Roy W. Mill-
er, said his client was part of the
"intelligentsia," so smart she has
trouble relating to the world.
"Her history speaks for itself,"
he said. "Something's wrong
with this lady, OK?"
Bishop, 45, grew up in subur-
ban Braintree, about eight miles
south of Boston. Her mother,
Judith, was active in local poli-
tics as one of 240 elected town
meeting members. Her father,
Samuel Bishop, was a North-
eastern University art professor
whose former students include
David Bushell, a producer on
films including the Academy
Award-winning "Sling Blade."
The Bishops were friendly and
academically minded parents,
often urging their children, both
gifted students and violinists, to
get their work done, Dan Shaw
said. He was frequently over at
their house as a child visiting the
Bishops' son, Seth.
Shaw didn't know Amy Bishop
well but remembered her "excep-
tional intelligence" and that she
wasn't shy about giving her opin-
ion.

"If somebody was talking
about something and she felt
they were incorrect, she'd (say)
to the person, this is this or that
is that," he said.
Shaw also recalled the funeral
for Seth Bishop. The 18-year-old
was killed in 1986 when his sis-
ter fired a shotgun blast into his
chest, then fled. She was arrest-
ed at gunpoint but never charged
in the death, which was ruled
accidental.
That killing is getting new
scrutiny since the rampage at the
University of Alabama in Hunts-,
ville.
Shaw, 40, remembered waiting
in a line of mourners to give con-
dolences to the family and find-
ing Amy Bishop being propped
up by her parents, weeping hys-
terically.
Shaw said no one in Braintree,
where Shaw has lived most of
his life, ever thought she meant
to kill her brother, whom Bishop
named her only son after. Shaw's
opinion hasn't .changed, despite
implications by the current
police chief that she was protect-
ed by a cover-up..
"The Bishops had no political
clout in town," Shaw said.
Amy Bishop was at Northeast-
ern University when she shot
her brother, and there was no
interruption to her schooling.-
She graduated cum laude in 1988
with a biology degree, complet-
ing an honors thesis titled, "The
effect of temperature on the
recovery of sea lamprey from full
spinal cord transection."
She earned her Ph.D. in genet-
ics from Harvard in 1993. It was
also that year that she was ques-
tioned by police when a doctor
she worked with at Children's
Hospital received a mail bomb
that never went off. No one was
ever charged in the case.
After earning her doctorate,
she began an academic career
that took her from Harvard to
Huntsville.
Bishop co-authored 17 pub-
lished papers and also invented a
new kind of cell incubator. In the
meantime, she had three daugh-
ters and a son with her husband,
James Anderson, whom she met
at a gathering to play the Dun-

geons & Dragons fantasy game.
She moved in 2003 to Hunts-
ville, where students gave her
mixed reviews. Some found her
obsessed with her Harvard pedi-
gree, while others hailed her
brilliance. Despite her prodi-
gious intellect, she was denied
tenure. Her job was about to end
this semester.
Dr. Keith Ablow, a forensic
psychiatrist from Tufts Univer-
sity in the Boston suburb of Med-
ford, said the tenure denial could
have been like "a kind of deadly
assault on her ego" if her self-
worth was wrapped up in her
academic credentials.
"In that way, firing a gun at
those people could feel like self-
defense in a twisted way," he
said.
Bishop's friend Rob Dinsmoor.
said she was frustrated over her
tenure battle, but never let on
how furious she was. There were
other things she hid during their
regular conversations, including
that she once had a brother.
"I felt we could talk about
anything," Dinsmoor said. "But
obviously there were things that
she would not talk to me about."
Dinsmoor said that amid
her career problems, Bishop
dreamed about a literary escape.
One of her three unpublished
novels, "Amazon Fever," has
pieces of her real life. One char-
acter was tortured by the death
of his brother. Bishop takes some
shots at Harvard, including the
line, "At Harvard even the bar
tenders are snotty." Her main
character, a female researcher,
is frustrated about her stalled
career and literally dreams about
tenure.
"She felt warm, happy, ful-
filled and yet she knew it was
just a dream," wrote Bishop, a
second cousin of novelist John
Irving.
Bishop is being held without
bond on capital murder charges.
She's under suicide watch, and
her attorney said she's remorse-
ful but can't recall the shooting
- which is exactly what she told
police after she shot her brother.
Bishop's husband said she
calls to check on their children,
but he can't tell how she's doing.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Ex-mayor accused
of accepting bribes
A businessman who pleaded
guilty in an ongoing corruption
probe told federal investigators he
paid $100,000 in bribes to former
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick
to secure lucrative contracts for
Detroit's Cobo Center, the Detroit
Free Press reported yesterday.
Former Cobo Center contractor
Karl Kado of West Bloomfield has
also told the FBI he paid $290,000
to Kilpatrick's father, Bernard Kil-
patrick, and thousands more to a
close mayoral aide, the newspaper
reported.
Kado told authorities he paid
Kwame Kilpatrick in four or five
installments of about $20,000 each,
the Free Press said in its report,
which cited its review of govern-
ment documents and interviews
with people the newspaper said
were familiar with the probe. The
newspaper did not identify the peo-
ple.
Kado, who is awaiting sentenc-
ing for paying bribes to protect
multimillion-dollar Cobo Center
contracts, told investigators he
sometimes delivered the money
in envelopes to Kilpatrick's City
Hall office. Other times, Kilpatrick
dropped by Cobo Center - Detroit's
downtown convention center - to
get the cash, Kado allegedly told
authorities.
MELBOURNE, Fla.
Teenage girls hit,
killed by train
After goofing around down-
town, four teenagers marched
past a "no trespassing" sign and
a braved a railroad trestle that
spans 200 feet over a creek. As
they joked around and took pic-
tures at the bridge's halfway
point, an oncoming train barreled
down the tracks, its whistle howl-
ing alarm.
Onlookers yelled for the teens
to run or jump into the slow-mov-
ing water 20 feet below, but only a
young boy could sprint to safety.,
The three others, all girls, were
killed Saturday as the sun set over
Crane Creek, police and witness-
es said.
The teenagers had been hang-
ing out in Melbourne's downtown
area known for its siops and
nightclubs - when they decided
to cross the trestle around 6:30
p.m., Lt. Curtis Barger said. Their
parents had dropped them off at
a mall; and then they took a bus
downtown where they were "just
goofing off," he said, without
elaborating.

Dutch troops to
leave Afghanistan
Prime Minister Jan Peter
Balkenende said yesterday Dutch
troops will begin leaving south-
ern Afghanistan in August, since
his caretaker government has no
authority to accept a NATO request
to stay on.

Speaking a day after his coali-
tion government collapsed over the
issue, Balkenende said the Nether-
lands will end its role in Uruzgan
province, where 21 Dutch soldiers
have been killed since the mission
was first deployed in 2006.

In response, the SCC staged a

After 37 days, the artifacts were
removed and University admin-
istrators formed a panel to look
into the issue. In July of that year,
Michigamua vacated its office

it leave the space, though it was

DPS official says
rise in price of
precious metals may
be cause of thefts
By VALIANT LOWITZ
Daily StaffReporter
There's been a recent surge of car
part theft around Ann Arbor and
across the nation and Department
of Public Safety officials say it's due
to an increase in the price of pre-
cious metals.
Over the past few weeks, the
number of thefts involving catalytic
converters - a part used to convert
harmful pollutants into less harm-
ful emissions before they leave the
exhaust system of a vehicle - has
risen at the University.
In 1975, the United States gov-
ernment mandated that catalytic
converters be placed in all U.S.
cars and trucks. A key component
of the converter is made of pre-
cious metals like platinum, rho-
dium or gold.
According to DPS spokeswom-
an Diane Brown, there have been
five to eight reported thefts of the
part on campus. Though normally
uncommon, Brown said the thefts
have sprung up "in rashes" as the
price of metal has increased.
"Periodically this happens par-
ticularly when the price of metal
goes up," Brown said. "It's been
quite a bit of time, but a couple years
ago we had a lot of theft of spools of
wire used on construction."
She also added that this is not the
first time there's been a trend of cat-
alytic converter thefts on campus.
Brown said the majority of the
recent thefts occurred last Tuesday
evening in the Northwood Com-
munity Apartments parking lot on
North Campus, but that multiple
thefts have been reported through-
out Ann Arbor.
According to the DPS crime log,
three thefts were reported on Sat-
urday from cars parked on Beal
Street and Cram Place.
Architecture senior Diana Berry,

a resident of the Northwood Com-
munity Apartments, said she went.
to drive somewhere Wednesday
morning and noticed there was
something wrong with her vehicle
when she turned it on.
"It sounded like the car was with-
out a muffler," she said. "It sounded
like a racecar."
Berry said the suspects sawed
off her car's converter, causing
the exhaust to come through the
engine.
LSA sophomore Jacqueline Wil-
ton said she also had her converter
stolen last week.
"I went to my house this week-
end, and when I got back I just
noticed that my car sounded like a
motorcycle," Wilton said.
Wilton said the theft cost her
more than $200 in repairs.
The crimes appear to be follow-
ing a national trend, with police
departments throughout country
reporting increases in catalytic con-
verter thefts.
According to a 2008 article on
MSNBC.com, the thieves slip under
vehicles - sometimes in broad day-
light and with nothing more then a
wrench or a battery-powered saw -
and remove the converters ina mat-
ter of minutes.
With commodity metal prices
skyrocketing in recent years - the
price of platinum rose from $500
per ounce in 2000 to more than
$1,500 in2008, according tovarious
news sources - the easy-to-steal
converters are becoming more prof-
itable for thieves.
Depending on which metal the
converter contains, thieves are able
to sell the parts to metal recyclers
for up to $200, according to the
MSNBC.com article.
According to Brown, students
should get their vehicles checked if
there is a loud noise coming from
the engine.
"If anybody has heard any sus-
picious behavior or heard some
unusual noises at night they should
contact the University Police,"
Brown said.
She added that a crime bulletin
will be sent out in the next few days
with more information for students.

Keeping close to home
'U' must encourage graduates to stay in Michigan
T he University has always been known for its high-caliber
academics, its dedication to furthering research and its
large in-state student body. But with Michigan residents
leaving the state in large numbers in response to the poor econom-
ic climate, the ratio of in-state to out-of state students enrolled at
the University could change. And though the University may be
forced to change its in-state to out-of-state student ratio to main-
tain its academic reputation, it should remember its commitment
to the state and its residents. To help benefit Michigan's failing
economy, the University should focus on the creation of programs
that will keep students in Michigan after they graduate.

Polit ical correctness run a mo

Currently, 65 percent of University stu-
dents are Michigan residents. 35 percent of
students are non-Michigan residents. But,
as the Daily reported last week, a Decem-
ber 2009 U.S. Census study showed that
at least 32,759 residents have left the state
between July 2008 and July 2009. The
state population is currently hovering at a
little under 10 million 'residents. The resi-
dential population has not been under 10
million since 2001. Despite the declining
in-state population, the number of in-state
applications to the University rose by 6.6
percent. And while the University is fully
aware of the dwindling population, offi-
cials - including University Provost The-
resa Sullivan - aren't concerned about the
decrease in state population.
As Sullivan pointed out in a recent Daily
article, the declining state population isn't
expected to reflect a huge change in in-state
applicants and enrollees in the near future.
But in the event that an even larger popula-
tion decrease occurs in the future, the Uni-
versity must stay committed to Michigan
and its residents: The University is a public
institution and Michigan residents support
it through taxes. In return, the University
must maintain its commitment to the state.
But the University's commitment may
not always mean preferring in-state to out-
of-state students. The state depends on the
University to produce the best possible
workforce, and that means the University

must maintain its high academic caliber.
It would be a disservice to the University
and the state if students accepted weren't
well qualified. University graduates are in
prime position to stimulate the growth of
science and technology industries in Michi-
gan. Regardless of population changes, the
University must continue to admit highly
qualified individuals to ensure its continued
production of students that will benefit the
changing Michigan economy.
It is currently unclear what - if anything
at all - the state's population decrease
will mean for University enrollment. The
University may find no shortage of highly
qualified Michigan students to admit. But
regardless of a potential ratio change, the
University should encourage students to
stay in Michigan after graduation. The
University should further develop partner-
ships like the job placement program that
the College of Engineering has with Ford
Motor Co. Programs similar to this partner-
ship will encourage University graduates to
seek employment within the state.
To maintain a balance between a com-
mitment to academic excellence and a
commitment to the state, the University
must produce a workforce that will benefit
the state's economy. Building up and cre-
ating programs that would encourage stu-
dents to remain in state after graduation
is just one way that the University and the
state could improve.

We all want solutions - it's
a basic human need. The
world is a big, complex
place, and we want
to deal with its
problems in bits -
and pieces so that
we may at least
have the satisfac-
tion of solving a
partof the problem.
But too often such
an approach simply
doesn't work. TheI
Michigan Student IMRAN
Assembly and the SYED
Daily's editorial
page, in their push
to mandate the use
of gender-neutral language on cam-
pus, have forgotten this timeless les-
son.
The idea is simple enough: Propo-
nents say that the pronouns "he" and
"she" discriminate against students
who do not identify with either. The
better approach, they say, is to have
the University, its faculty and stu-
dents use gender-neutral references
such as "they" whenever possible.
But that solution is so perfunctory
that it borders on offensive.
MSA recently passed a resolution
to switch to gender-neutral language
in the Statement of Student Rights
and Responsibilities. The Daily's edi-
torial page went several steps further,
calling for a University-wide policy -
one that, alarmingly, would "require
professors to more carefully consider
their words and avoid using gender-
specific language that doesn't include
all students" (He/she/ze, 02/17/2010).
The reaction was predictable, with
most of the online comments to the
Daily's editorial expressing varying
degrees of frustration over political
correctness gone wild.
The simplistic political correct-
ness driving the change bothered me
as well. But I'm much more concerned

that this is yet another instance of a
hollow gesture masking a gross lack
of commitment to understanding the
underlying issue and to taking the
costly steps to resolve it.
To make my argument clearer,
let's consider the example of "Don't
ask, Don't tell." The policy was insti-
tuted in the mid-1990s and sold to us
as progress. Gay people could now
serve in the military, as long as they
pretended not to be gay, which, of
course, really means that gay people
still cannot serve in the military.
Since the policy was instituted, more
than 13,000 service members have
been discharged because they chose
not to pretend.
The stopgap rhetorical change
that "Don't ask, Don't tell" brought
was not only not a solution but actu-
ally stands in the way of a true solu-
tion today: Every time a proposal to
change the policy is brought forth,
opponents can simply point to DADT
and say it was compromise that is
progress enough - while knowing
full well that the policy did nothing
to change the underlying biases that
led to the exclusion of homosexuals
in the first place and, in fact, encour-
aged the view that homosexuals are
outsiders who don't belong.
It is exactly that sort of exoticiza-
tion and polarization that I fear will
result from this simplistic switch to
using gender-neutral language.
That women feel excluded by
the default use of the pronoun "he"
and that transgendered people feel
excluded by "he/she" being the only
options are undeniable. But these
feelings of exclusion are symptoms
brought on by the wider problem of
discrimination and lack of under-
standing. A superficial rewriting of
the student handbook (proposed by
MSA) or even outright censorship
of classroom discourse (which is the
inevitable outcome of the Daily's
proposal) will do nothing to correct

those underlying problems.
Like our hyper-sensitive society,
the University is very good at saying
all the right things. In the brochures
for the University's various schools,
you can read pages upon pages about
its commitment to diversity of all
forms. And yet the fact remains that
the moment I step foot into any of my
Law School classes and take a look at
the racial composition of the class, it
mayas wellbe 1910 as opposed to2010.
Discrimination in
language is part of
a larger problem.

For all its talk aboutbeing inclusive
to people of all backgrounds because
they bring unique experiences to the
campus community - rhetoric that
was carried all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court in the 2003 cases of
Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bo-
linger - this University still had to
be threatened, harassed and coerced
into meeting the requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990 in the Michigan Stadium reno-
vation process.
Be it a race and ethnicity require-
ment that lacks bite, a Detroit Center
that's closed to all but those with a
special card or yet another sympo-
sium on this, that and the other thing
plaguing inner cities, we've had plen-
ty of talk and empty gestures around
this campus. Perhaps an institution
of such immensity can do no bet-
ter than a glacial pace. But students
should know better than to become
enablers.

Good behavior, bad regulation


Two eyes on the road

What is more important to the state of
Michigan: money or crime rates? This question
is now less hypothetical than you may think.
A new proposal from Michigan Gov. Jennifer
Granholm, a Democrat, aims to bring back
an ideal that was banned over 30 years ago in
the state. Granholm has introduced a measure
that would reinstitute the time off for good
behavior practice in Michigan penitentiaries.
Granholm has decided to bring back the poli-
cy, which was phased out in 1978, shortening
prison sentences for inmates with good prison
records. So which is more important?
It is a tricky question, to be sure. Michi-
gan has been driven almost to bankruptcy by
a combination of the failing auto industry and
inept governments in Detroit and Lansing. As
a result, any money-saving venture should cer-
tainly be welcomed. But the cost of security is
definitely something that needs to be looked at
closely.
It seems to me that the concept of time off
for good behavior is a fairly counter-intuitive
measure. If someone murders another person
but gets along great with other convicts, I don't
think that makes the murderer any better of a
person. In the same vein but on the other end of
the spectrum, ifa man goes to prison for pos-
session of marijuana and repeatedly acts up
in prison, that doesn't mean he's less fit to be
released.
The issue at hand here shouldn't be time
credits or good behavior, but a complete reform
of the justice and corrections systems in the
state. Non-violent offenders, such as posses-
sion or white-collar crimes, shouldn't be pun-
ished in the same fashion as people convicted
of rape or murder. The sentencing system -
and the 'use of prisons - should be looked at
with a more critical eye and include more cre-

ative punishments for non-violent crimes.
Granholm has allowed Michigan to turn into
a national laughingstock on her watch - argu-
ably, the state has two of the worst cities in the
nation in terms of crime and economics. To
allow more violent crimes to occur by repeat
offenders is not a good way to combat this.
Another issue to be dealt with is the issue of
Michigan's state government and its inability
to manage anything resembling a budget. Gra-
nholm and her cronies seem to believe that if
you tax high, then somehow businesses will
flock to your state and your best and brightest
will stay in the state. In actuality, this leads to
less money and less opportunity for the state to
bounce back.
If Granholm wants to save money, she has a
few resources at her disposal. She can trim cor-
rections in earnest. Decriminalize drugs like
they did in season three of the television series,
"The Wire." Make parts of Detroit into "Ham-
sterdam." (I don't feel bad about not explaining
this. If you don't watch "The Wire," you don't
get the pleasure of the reference.) Or maybe
don't overspend on welfare by $6.2 million.
There is also the issue of state lawmakers and
their salaries but maybe we can discuss that
issue another day.
For me, this comes down to a personal deci-
sion. I don't want to walk down the street and
wonder if some child rapist got out of prison
early because he was buddy-buddy with a
guard in prison.,There are a million ways to
save money in Michigan, cut parts of correc-
tions, cut stupid unnecessary funding in other
departments like agriculture. Granholm has
effectively killed this state enough. Please
don't allow the actual killers back into society.

But I'm willing RATKOWIAK
to accept my weak-
nesses. That's why
I rarely talk on the phone or text while
driving a car, especially while navigat-
ing Ann Arbor, where student pedes-
trians (including myself) blatantly
disregard all traffic laws. Most of my
friends regularly type and talk while
they drive, though. And one of the first
things they say about it is, "I do it, but I
know Ishouldn't."
The Ann Arbor City Council is try-
ing to change that, and it's about time.
On Tuesday, the council passed the
first draft of a proposed city ordinance
that would make it illegal to text or
talk on the phone while drivinginAnn
Arbor. Of course, this isn't a novel idea
- the state of Michigan is currently
in the process of passing legislation
that will prohibit texting while driv-
ing. But I'm glad to see Ann Arbor has
decided the issue of impaired driv-
ing is serious enough to take action
now instead of waiting for the state's
bureaucracy to take its course.
The proposed Ann Arbor ordinance
prohibits both motorists and bicy-
clists from talking on the phone, lis-
tening to voicemail, texting, using the
Internet or operating a GPS, unless in
an emergency situation. There is one
big exception - hands-free devices

v

aren't included in the ban. That seems
like a cop-out, considering multiple
studies have shown hands-free devic-
es are no safer than using handheld
cell phones. But despite that, the City
Council still has the right idea - even
if most University students aren't
going to like the law.
According to the Governors High-
way Safety Association, six states
and Washington, D.C. currently ban
cell phone use while driving, and 19
states and Washington, D.C. ban tex-
ting while driving. In both the state of
Michigan and in Ann Arbor, similar
legislation is long overdue. A New Eng-
land Journal of Medicine study from
February 1997, one of the first studies
on the topic, showed that motorists
using cell phones while driving were
four times more likely to get in a car
accident than those who weren't on
their phones. Those findings have only
been reinforced over the past 13 years
but not without a few shocking adden-
dums - like the fact that driving while
on the phone is as statistically danger-
ous as driving drunk.
But even without those facts, it's
easy to see the dangers of distracted
drivers who talk on the phone while
navigating campus. In a city like Ann
Arbor, with cramped streets and a
high population of bikers and walkers,
the ordinance should be as unforgiving
as possible to discourage the behavior.
And in its current form, the proposed
legislation will be plenty strict.
In the Ann Arbor ordinance, talk-
ing or texting while driving would be
a primary offense. That's a leg up on
the state's version of the bill, where
texting while driving is only a second-
ary offense - the motorists can only
be ticketed after they've been pulled
over for another traffic violation,
which makes it hard to take the state's
law seriously.
And the proposed fines for vio-

lating the Ann Arbor ordinance are
steep, especially for cash-strapped
college students - a $125 fine for a
standard violation and a $300 fine if
the violation resulted in a motor vehi-
cle accident.
Driving on the
phone is as risky as
driving drunk.

The high fines might seem unnec-
essary, but when students drive in
Ann Arbor, we're often only in the
car for five or 10 minutes at a time.
It's not like most of us are commut-
ing or sitting in gridlock, where it
might be more understandable to
talk on the phone to pass the time.
I know that the thought of making
a $125 mistake would definitely be
enough to make me put the phone
away until I got home from Meijer.
Some people may complain that
this is just another way for the Ann
Arbor Police Department to make
easy money handing out tickets. I'm
usually in that camp - after all, I
often wish our city's law enforcement
had better things to do than ticket
cars at 9:45 a.m. for parking in spots
that are only free from 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. But now it looks like Ann Arbor
might be about to crack down on an
activity that will finally have more
positive effects than just feeding the
city's coffers - and that should be
enough to support hanging up our

Compelling confession

They call him Mr. Poitier

Gil Scott Heron
returns with a short,
introspective album
By JOE DIMUZIO
For the Daily
Watching The Who perform
at the Super Bowl was a difficult
experience. It
wasn't the lights,
embarrassingly
tight shirts or Gil Scott
overall lack of
energy. There was Heron
something slightly I'm New Here
more troubling.
Throughout the XL
show, the audience
was faced with unanswerable ques-
tions: How do classic artists main-
tain their integrity into old age?
How can they release music that is
more than just competent but rel-
evant or even exciting? How do you
stay cool forever?
Gil Scott Heron is an iconic poet,
author and musician whose spoken-
word pieces "The Bottle" and "The
Revolution Will Not Be Televised"
led to public and critical acclaim
throughout the '70s and early '80s.
His speak-sing and proto-rap vocal
styles were influential in hip hop's
genesis, and he became an icon of
the black militant movement. Some
call him the black Bob Dylan. For
roughly the past 20 years, Heron
battled drugs, alcohol and jail time,
all the while sporadically record-
ing and performing. Now, in his
first proper LP since 1994's Spirits,
Heron is paired with producer and
owner of XL Records, Richard Rus-
sell, for I'm New Here.
As a title, it makes a lot of sense
- Here is composed of elements
both new and old. Under Russell's
production, Heron, whose rich
baritone has been weathered to a
slurring rasp, is placed atop sparse
industrial backing tracks. Where
Heron's vibrant voice would have
traded space with warm hand-
claps and natural instrumentation
on his classic records, Here sur-
rounds him with muted, robotic
percussion, whirring keyboards
and a rare backing choir that sound
like the Sweet Inspirations locked
in a basement. The album begins
with "On Coming From A Bro-
ken Home," a poetic reflection on
maternal figures both aged and

ily Arts does not condone smoking, unless it makes you look at least this cool.

nostalgic, set to the orchestrated
intro loop of Kanye West's "Flash-
ing Lights". On Here, new and old
sit side-by-side.
I'm New Here is slight, by inten-
tion and accident. Essentially, there
are four actual "songs" (three of
which are covers), six recitations
and a few interludes in all, running
under a half hour. The "songs" are
the most impressive moments on
the album, though they largely feel
half baked. The first single, "Me
and the Devil," is a chugging, key-
board-based re-imagining of blues
legend Robert Johnson's classic.
But beyond its sleek and purpose-
fully spare clank, the song goes
nowhere. A faithful and appropri-
ate rendition of the album's title
track, a Smog original, sounds eeri-
ly close to lead singer Bill Callah-
an's vocal stylings, simply arranged
with a warm acoustic guitar and
Heron's voice. The grooving, unset-
tling thump of "New York is Killing
Me" is the album's highest achieve-
ment, marrying Russell's inten-
tionally sparse production with a
gradual atonal 12-bar blues stomp
and Heron's growling. Aside from
these cuts, Heron's poems are pre-
sented with subtle and evocative
instrumentals that ebb and disap-
pear beneath his words.
The lyrics are where I'm New

Here presents Heron's most sig-
nificant shift. Whereas the Heron
of 1974 penned robust social com-
mentaries, I'm New Here feels like a
reserved confessional. Unfinished
letters to an ex, dead-drunk mus-
ings and long-gone family members
cement the focus of Here; this is
the introspective Heron.-And while
this personal focus is a great con-
cept, the 30-minute sketch of an
album does little to grant it staying
power.
I'm New Here is worth a cursory
listen, and that's its problem. The
material, while interesting and sin-
gular, never manages to achieve the
heights of Heron's previous work.
To a degree, the intent to under-
whelm is intentional on Russell and
Heron's part. The songs aren't fully
colored in on purpose. This is what
Heron has "become": fractured,
incomplete, messy. But that doesn't
prevent you from wanting more.
Classic '70s albums like There's a
Riot Goin' On and On the Beach made
the most of the mid-tempo, going
everywhere and nowhere in the con-
text of slight songs. This is a feeling
that Here teeters and retreats from.
And while Heron has no chance
in hell at a halftime performance at
the Super Bowl, he has produced a
compelling product late in his game.
Cool? Yeah. Fulfilling? Not yet.

Recently I was surfing
the Caribbean - that
is, surfing Caribbean-
affiliated websites for a class
assignment about Cuban cinema
- when I
discovered
something A
fascinating:
This week,
the Univer-
sity of the
Bahamas is
hosting the
five-day Sid- ANDREW
ney Poitier LAPIN
International
Conference
and Film Festival. It's not the
location of this conference that
I'm excited about, since Poitier
is a Bahamian-American, and if
there was going to be an elabo-
rate conference in his honor,
that's where it would be. No,
the exciting part is the fact that
a Poitier conference is taking
place at all.
How many other screen
actors can you name, living
or dead, whose careers would
necessitate such an elaborate
retrospective? I can't think of
any myself, and if any similar
conferences have taken place
to analyze someone else's life's
work, I would go so far as to
deem them superfluous. No,
only Poitier, with his cemented
position as the first bankable
black box-office star in Ameri-
can film history and his inner
turmoil over betraying his
race by allowing himself to be
typecast as the "saintly Negro,"
can fuel such debate and post-
retirement appreciation from
film scholars and audiences
alike.
If you're a fan of old Hol-
lywood films from the'50s and
'60s, and/or if you've read Mark
Harris's amazing Hollywood
history book "Pictures at a Rev-
olution," you'll know Poitier as
the star of mostly race-centered
melodramas like "Lilies of the
Field," "To Sir With Love" and
"Guess Who's Coming to Din-
ner." Throughout the majority of
his career, the actor was being
used primarily as a symbol, the
physical embodiment of white
liberal guilt.
The Hollywood idealists of
the Civil Rights era, like "Din-
ner" director Stanley Kramer,

were desperate to make mov-
ies depicting black characters
as the exact opposite of every
racial stereotype that had been
perpetuated up until that point.
So instead of poor, uneducated
and jive-talking, the characters
Poitier played tended to be far
smarter, politer and more elo-
quent than his white co-stars.
Which nevertheless represented
radical progress; after all, his'
movies still couldn't be shown in
the South.
I don't mean to besmirch
Poitier's legacy asa trailblazer
for racial equality in the cin-
ema. After all, someone had to
be Sidney Poitier atthat point
in history if the movies wanted
any hope of breaching segrega-
tion. But it's because his role in
history was so essential that I
question whether Poitier was
uniquely qualified to play it, or
if he simply became this sym-
bol by virtue of being the right
black actor at the right time.
In other words, maybe Poitier
wasn't respected as an actor for
the content of his character, but
rather for the color of his skin.
To be fair, though, our com-
mon perception of Poitier's
onscreen career is only based
off of the work he did prior
to 1967. That was the year he
starred in Norman Jewison's
"In the Heat of the Night," the
gritty police drama in which he
played a detective who has to
partner up with Rod Steiger's
bigoted cop to solve a murder
case in the Deep South. The
film was revolutionary because
it allowed Poitier to get mad,
to show signs of humanity, to
return a slap to his face from a
hateful white man with a slap
of equal magnitude. And the
fact that it won Best Picture
that year over "Coming to
Dinner," the poster child for a
sappy, "saintly Negro" Poitier
picture, made the symbolism of
its victory all the sweeter.
Last August, Poitier - who's
been retired from the screen
since 1997's "The Jackal" -
received the Presidential Medal
of Freedom. Maybe it's just my
cynicism talking, but I read his
reception of the award as less
of a genuine testament to his
career than a giant mea culpa
from America, via the federal
government: "We're sorry you

had to play sexless, emotion-
less, idealized depictions of
what we used to think black
men should be like in order to
pave the way for future actors
of color. Here's a medal to make
up for it."
Thankfully, the Bahamas
conference will serve as the
proper tribute to Poitier's leg-
acy. One glance at the speaker
schedule reveals a fascinating
array of topics to be discussed,
including an essay linking the
man's celebrity to Will Smith
and an entire day centered
around his directing career (he
helmed nine films between 1970
and 1990, no doubt bolstered
by the success of "Heat of the
Night"). And look, here's Michi-
gan's own American Culture
Ph.D. candidate, Charles Gen-
Behind the
first bankable
black actor.
try, delivering a talk entitled, "
'A Revolutionary Process': Sid-
ney Poitier and Constructions
of Blackness in Transnational
Cinema, 1957-1964." So it would
appear that Poitier the man and
Poitier the symbol are going to
be celebrated in equal measure.
And there are many signs
today that, despite his initial
role as apawn of the Hollywood
agenda, Poitier has still had a
profound impact on the ways
we view race on film. At the
very least, we can point to the
fact that "Guess Who's Coming
to Dinner" was remade in 2005,
in comedic form with the races
reversed, and Poitier's role was
played by the noticeably white
Ashton Kutcher. And America
laughed. This week, I'm hoping
Poitier can bask in the heat of
the Bahaman night and admire
how far we've all come, thanks
at least in part to him.
For once, his admirers won't
call him the representation of
black America. They'll call him
Mister Poitier.

. Shorties playing at the Michigan

By EMILY BOUDREAU, JENNIFER XU
and CARLY STEINBERGER
Daily Arts Writers and For the Daily
Short films tend to be an under-appreciated art
form these days, but they
always get some annual Oscar-Nominated
love from the Oscars in
the form of the Best Ani- Short Films
mated and Best Live- At the Michigan
Action Short categories. until Wednesday
The Daily's film staff is Shorts Internatisnal
here to parse through this
year's selections. All of
these nominated films are currently playing on a
single bill at the Michigan Theater.
Animated Short Films
"Wallace and Gromit:
A Matter of Loaf and Death"
A serial killer is on the loose. The target? Bak-
ers, leaving everyone's favorite Claymation duo as
the only bakers left in the town. This is great for
business, but when a heavyset bread model seduc-
es Wallace, the pair's prospects don't look too
bright. As Wallace's love literally blossoms like
bread in the oven, death looms ever closer. This is
one of the longer shorts, but it's lighthearted and
witty. The silly inventions, subtle sexual innuen-
dos and expressions of disgust on Gromit's face
all come together to form a carefully constructed
animated world.
"Logorama"
French director Frangois Alaux delivers a
searing critique of American culture through
a Los Angeles inhabited entirely by logos. The.
Pringle face drives trucks, Apple apples grow
on trees and the Michelin man works as a cop.
But the streets are no longer safe, as the most-
wanted criinal, Ronald McDonald (who else?),
is on the loose. By this point, it's a bit too easy to
criticize America for rampant consumerism and
violence. What makes this short different is the
way the corporate symbols pop out and are given
their own personalities. The pavement cracks
into an X-Box symbol and Mr. Clean is cast as
an effeminate zookeeper. The little twists are
enough to make people rethink the way adver-
tising works.
"French Roast"
A man loses his wallet in a French bistro
while being pestered by a homeless man, a sin-
ister nun and a sleepy policeman, resulting in a
slight misunderstanding. The characters are all
a little creepy looking and don't quite fit in with
the farcical tone of the plot. The short is enter-
taining, but it gets a bit repetitive after a while.

The characters all show emotion in a predictably
cartoonish way, with buggy eyes and twitching
mustaches. The short is so bent on hammering
in a moral to the story that the end loses all sense
of charm.
"The Lady and the Reaper"
This story of an old woman who just wants to
rest peacefully explores the implications of mod-
ern medicine and morality. The woman becomes
caught in a struggle between a young whiz-kid
doctor and the Grim Reaper. The struggle evolves
into a slapstick fight over the woman's body.
Despite his reputation, it's hard not to root for the
Reaper as he develops an engaging personality
without really saying anything. His expressions
and demeanor allow him to seem funny and natu-
ral, rather than a menacing figure.
"Granny O' Grim"
This six-minute Irish film is absolutely delight-
ful. A kooky grandmother with a flair for theater
decides to tell her nervous grandson her version
of the fairy tale "Sleeping Beauty." She's trying to
get him to fall asleep, but because her spin on the
story is a bit horrific, her efforts prove detrimen-
tal. It's clever to see how it all plays out.
Live Action Films
"Instead of Abracadabra"
In this "Napoleon Dynamite"-meets-Todd
Solondz-meets-John-Waters amalgamation
(with a drop of Swedish drag queen), Tomas, a
clumsy, theatrical 25-year-old who still lives with
his parents, tries to make it a big as a magician.
After an embarrassing mishap at his first exhibi-
tion, Tomas tries to impress his new neighbor at
his father's 60th birthday celebration, a gig only
promised to him on the grounds that he will geta
real job. "Chimay!" the eyeliner-coated, sparkle-
faced, ruffle-wearing illusionist histrionically
shouts. "She-male?" asks the confused photogra-
pher. "No, Chimay!" he replies. "Instead of abra-
cadabra."
"The Door"
It's traditional for the Oscar Live Action Short
category to be dominated by "socially relevant"
films, and it's not at all unlikely that they win,
either. "The Door" revisits the well-worn story of
the Chernobyl incident of 1986, where a family is
evacuated and quarantined after the radioactive
explosion impacts their health. The father sym-
bolically attempts to steal the door off his own
apartment, a door on which he eventually lays his
own daughter out for her funeral. In an attempt
to make its lack of originality more palatable, the
film tells its events out of order, "(500) Days of

Summer" style, but this disjunction just becomes
confusing.
"Kavi"
Embracing the "Slumdog Millionaire" trend
with full force, "Kavi" is about an impoverished
Indian bricklayer boy with a love for cricket. The
young protagonist is brutally taunted by his mas-
ter when he expresses a desire to go to school. The
plot is really nothing new, but the uncomfortably
intimate close-ups map out the raw desire and
patent hunger in the boy's eyes. It's clear there's
something rotten in the state of India. But just to
make sure we really got the point, the director
tacks a PSA-style message about Indian slavery at
the end. "Kavi" is heartbreaking, to be sure, but
just a bit too overwrought to be effective.
"Miracle Fish"
It's to director Luke Doolan's credit that we
have no idea what to expect from this film as it
roams shot to shot. A young Australian boy liv-
ing on welfare is bullied mercilessly when he only
receives a red Fortune Teller Miracle Fish for his
eighth birthday. He takes anap on the nurse's sick
cot, wishing that the entire world would go away.
He awakens, stunned, to find the entire school
emptied. Had he slept for so long it is now the
weekend? How had nobody noticed he was there?
Or is something more sinister lurking at the fring-
es? "Miracle Fish" is an impressive piece of work,
just because it manages to construct genuine ten-
sion out of one isolated moment.
"The New Tenants"
This Danish short is an enjoyable black com-
edy. Two gay men move into a new apartment and
within hours discover that the recently murdered
previous tenant, Jerry, was involved in some
shady business. The new renters encounter sev-
eral people who still have some bones to pick with
him. Jerry's angry acquaintances end up taking
their frustrations out on each other, and the bod-
ies begin the pile up. The film gets more ridicu-
lous and more hilarious as the shocked couple
bears witness to the scene.
Highly Commendable Short Films
It's a bit surprising that "Partly Cloudy," the
Pixar animated short, didn't receive a nomina-
tion. The adorable film depicts the relationship
between a stork and a cloud who forms baby
animals out of cloud dust. The Canadian film
"The Runaway" was less engaging, focusing on
the journey of a train desperately trying to make
it up a hill but running into a few problems on
the way. The Polish film "The Kinematograph"
was the only animated film with a dismal tone,
telling the story of an inventor whose wife suc-
cumbs to illness and dies.

83-year-old Dingell to campaign again

From Page 1A
by the narrowest of margins we
have missed again confronting
the things we did in 1929," Dingell
said. "We have severe economic
problems in the nation, in this
district and in this state, and they
have to be addressed."
Dingell also said he wants to
work toward education reform,
environmental efforts - including
the protection of Michigan's Great
Lakes - and health care reform,
a cause he has been championing
throughout his 54-year career.
"The fact is that we have prob-
lems in the state, where the gov-
ernor is struggling with great
difficulties with a recalcitrant
group in the legislature, " Din-
gell said. "We need to confront
problems with the environment.
We need to get a health insur-
ance program passed for the
benefit of these people. We have
to move forward with the educa-
tion of our people, with the pro-
tection of the environment, with
the clean up and protection of
our waters and again, to save the
Great Lakes."
Dingell said he will be looking
for the support of Michigan citi-
zens to help him in his campaign
and to help him be a leader on
CYBERATTACKS
From Page 1A
having any involvement in the
attack.
An anonymous spokesperson
from SJTU was quoted by Xin-
hua News Agency - an official
press agency in China - and
claimed that The New York
Times article was not "objective"
or "balanced."
"We were shocked and indig-
* nant to hear these baseless alle-
gations which may harm the
university's reputation," the
spokesperson said.
University of Michigan
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
wrote in an e-mail interview
that the purpose of the joint
institute between SJTU and the
University is to give engineers
the opportunity to better under-

these issues.
"I think it's time for all hands
on deck. As I said, no one should
or can walk away from this, and
I intend to be in the forefront of
continuing these efforts," Dingell
said.
Dingell added that his cam-
paign and his potential reelection
will not onlybe beneficial for him-
self, but also his fellow Democrats,
who are concerned about main-
taining their stature in Congress
and in the state.
"We have much more to do,"
Dingell said. "And one of the
things is going to be to run a great
campaign to help some of the
wonderful candidates that the
Democrats are going to field to
move this country forward, both
in this Congressional district and
state, federal and local levels, but
also in other districts and in the
state-wide offices that are going to
be opening up this fall in the elec-
tion."
In an interview after Ding-
ell's announcement, State Rep.
Rebekah Warren (D-Ann Arbor)
said she is pleased to see Ding-
ell running for reelection and is
optimistic about the experience
he will bring in helping to restore
Michigan's troubled economy.
"I think it's a great thing for


us," Warren said. "I think in these
challenging times, his breadth of
experience and his focus on bring-
ing jobs to Michigan and righting
Michigan's economy is so impor-
tant, so I'm thrilled that he's going
back to Washington to keep fight-
ing for us in the 15th Congressio-
nal District."
LSA sophomore Brendan
Campbell, the newly-elected chair
of College Democrats, said he is
excited to be able to work with
Dingell, since he has admired his
work as an influential politician in
Michigan as well as in Washing-
ton.
"Congressman Dingell has been
for over 50 years one of Southeast
Michigan's strongest and most
forceful advocates in Washing-
ton, and we're proud and excited
to have him run for another term,
and we're excited to work with
him again in November," Camp-
bell said.
LSA senior Samuel Marvin,
former chair of the College Demo-
crats, mirrored Campbell's excite-
ment and said he was honored
that Dingell chose a College Dem-
ocrats event as the stage for his
announcement.
"We're humbled that he would
choose this location and this event
to make the announcement, and


we're thrilled that he's running
for reelection," Marvin said. "Hes
been a terrific supporter of this
organization, and so we're thrilled
that he would chose this audience,
this time, to make the announce-
ment."
LSA senior Kalen Pruss, a mem-
ber of the College Democrats,
said she wasn't surprised by his
announcement due to Dingell's
extensive work in Michigan over
the last few decades and said she
is eager to see him extend his work
in health care reform and other
efforts that will benefit the state.
"It wasn't unexpected because
Dingell has served for a really long
time," Pruss said. "But you know
hopefully he'll continue to work
hard to get us health care and
(work) on the issues protecting his
district."
Sonya Suter, another College
Democrats member and a senior
in the School of Public Policy, said
she is anticipating a good cam-
paign for Dingell and that Dingell
will continue to play a big role in
helping to shape the state of Mich-
igan.
"I think we all look forward to
another great election campaign,
and I think he'll continue doing
the great things as he has since the
1950s for the district," Suter said.

HALFWAY
From PagelA
they thought about it, and student
participation is what the RC's all
about," Sherman said.
Last Friday, Sherman and the
East Quad Music Co-Op held an
open mic night in the Halfway
inn as their first collaborative
event. During the show, Sherman
sat at a table and encouraged stu-
dents to come up and write down
suggestions on how to renew the
Halfway Inn and bring back its
personality.
"The beginning is trying to
see what the students themselves
want to see," Sherman said. "It's
not my vision; it's theirs."
Sherman said when she ini-
tially arrived in East Quad as a
freshman she viewed the Half-
way Inn as smelly and grungy, but
as she spent more time there she
was drawn more and more to the
atmosphere. -
She added that the dinginess
was part of the charm that fre-
quently attracted her and many
of her fellow East Quad residents
there.
"(The Halfway Inn) had things
going on every Friday from the
East Quad Music Co-Op," Sher-
man said. "And there'd be silly
kids doing silly things down
here and everyone hanging out,
and the atmosphere just really
embodied what I thought about
the RC."
In a Sept. 15 article in The
Michigan Daily, University Hous-
ing spokesman Peter Logan said
Housing moved the cafe to the
first floor to provide students with
more dining options. He added
that its previous location in the
basement limited dining services.
The lounge is still open to stu-
dents 24 hours a day for study-
ing or hanging out with friends.
Despite this, Sherman said few

students actually use the space,
with the exception of the East
Quad Music Co-Op.
"What I want mostly is a bunch
of student art all over the place. I
want student murals and student
submissions. I'd love to get one
of those spray paint chalk walls,"
Sherman said. "I just want it to
be a place where people can come
and do things like this that they
want to do and like hang out with
people if they want to. Because in
places where community fostered
art is established, it just inspires
people to get things done."
She also said that she hopes
by advocating for change like
this within East Quad,.she will
inspire students to work toward
their own ideas for change within
their residence halls and commu-
nity.
"Hopefully if people start
to really get active in building
the community and putting an
active effort into revamping this
Half-ass, then maybe they'll get
inspired, and if they see some-
thing they don't like, they'll say
'I can take an active role in this
because this is where I'm liv-
ing, and this is my community as
well,"' Sherman said.
School of Music, Theatre
& Dance senior Matt Steele, a
fourth-year member of the East
Quad Music Co-Op, said he hopes
to see the area restored because
he has fond memories of hanging
out in the space.
"It's cool to get the East Quad
kids more involved, and I remem-
ber before they closed the Half-
ass and the cafe, people were
always down here hanging out
and talking, and I would always
go meet people down here,"
Steele said. "So hopefully that
will come back because this is a
better space than anywhere else
I've been in the University to just
hang out and get work done but
also to meet with people."


stand what it means to work in
a "globalized engineering work
force."
According to Fitzgerald, there
are no University students study-
ing at SJTU this semester. Col-
lege of Engineering Prof. Jun
Ni is currently serving as dean
of the Joint Institute and is the
only University faculty member
at SJTU at this time.
Fitzgerald wrote that he
doesn't have any new informa-
tion regarding the details of the
cyberattacks allegedly coming
from SJTU.
David Munson, dean of the
College of Engineering, wrote in
an e-mail interview that he had
heard about the news reports
accusing STJU of initiating the
attacks but had no further infor-
mation.
"I do not have any indica-
tion that the (Joint Institute)

is involved in the allegations,"
Munson wrote.
Munson wrote that the Uni-
versity currently has more than
150 students from the Joint Insti-
tute majoring in College of Engi-
neering programs. He added that
about a dozen University faculty
members teach at the Joint Insti-
tute and a few dozen University
students study there each sum-
mer.
In 2005, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman visited
SJTU as part of a trip to China
to strengthen the University's
ties with faculty and students
at Chinese institutions. During
her visit, Coleman received an
honorary doctoral degree from
SJTU.
Last November, Coleman
announced she was planning to
return to SJTU this summer,
according to a Nov. 12 article in

The Michigan Daily.
"I'm going to be going to
China again next June to solid-
ify the relationship that we have
there with several institutions,"
Coleman told the Daily at the
time.
The Joint Institute offers
University students the
opportunity to receive dual
undergraduate and gradu-
ate engineering degrees from
STJU and the University's Col-
lege of Engineering. In 2001,
the University became the first
non-Chinese institution to offer
engineering degrees to students
studying in China.
According to a 2005 Univer-
sity press release, more than 50
University faculty members vis-
ited SJTU from 2000 to 2005,
and more than 20 University
professors taught summer class-
es during that same time period.

he had no additional information
other than what was sent in the
e-mail.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said DPS is investigating
the incidents, but that the depart-
ment needs the help of the cam-

pus community in order to find
the suspect.
"Right now we don't have a lot of
information," Brown said. "Unfor-
tunately we didn't get called at the
time of the incidents."
Brown said students and fac-
ulty should report any suspi-
cious activity immediately when
they see it, rather than after an
incident.

A night of improvisation at
Kerrytown Concert House

Daily Arts Writer

will be performing at the Kerry-
town Concert House tonight at 8
p.m.
Lonberg-Holm and Brftzmann
became acquainted with one
another through the Chicago10tet,
an ensemble led by Brotzmann
himself. It was in this group that
their improvisational techniques
were born.
"The Chicago 1Otet evolved over
the past five or six years, where
originally different members
would write pieces for us to per-
form," Lonberg-Holm said. "At a
certain time we wanted to throw
out the scores and just play, and
we've been working that way eves'
since. Peter lives in Germany, and
the ensemble is equally made up
of people from Chicago and from
Europe."
The two decided to collaborate
and go on a tour together after
many successful performances.
Lonberg-Holm plays the cello,
while Britzmann is on the saxo-
phone.
"Peter was coming into town for
a visual arts show he was running,
and he said, 'It would be cool to do
a series ofgigs together,"' Lonberg-
Holm said. "I've played in small
situations with I think just about
everybody in the 10tet. The band
is made up of smaller bands, so to

speak."
Lonberg-Holm believes that jazz
is the music of improvisers, but as
a whole he tries to stray away from
this label.
"You get so many different
things of what the man on the
street would say is jazz," Lonberg-
Holm said. "The word jazz is an
amorphous thing, I'm more com-
fortable not using it at all. It has
been used as a racist, street-jacket
term applied to African Americans,
so musicians in general have been
trying to get away from that. We
play music that's not such a typical
thing you hear. Everything is kind
of new and experimental."
With Lonberg-Holm and
Brftzmann's experience, improvi-
sation has become second nature
to them.
"We just start playing and see
where we end up, and where we
can go," Lonberg-Holm explained.
"He and I do things where there's
specific melodic material and a
rhythmic basis that the music is
goingtogrow out of"
Lonberg-Holm has performed
in Ann Arbor multiple times, and
a large factor in his return is the
respect he has for the Kerrytown
venue.

"Kerrytown has a long, excel-
lent history presenting improvised
music," Lonberg-Holm said. "The
first time I played there was some
day in the mid-'90s. For the last 10
years I've been there on average
every 15 months. It's a place that is
open to presenting different music
and it's a very nice sounding room."
Lonberg-Holm suggests that the
audience have an open mind during
f the performance, as this makes the
overall musical experience more
enjoyable.
Improv music
forms a story
without words.
"It can be kind of a trip or a
story without words, a non-linear
narrative," Lonberg-Holm said.
"The idea in a way is that as soon
as you try to force your thoughts
on other people, it loses them alto-
gether. It's more interesting for
the listener to leave their mind
open so they can put their own
angle on the music."

one of the most elementary
ingredients in filmmaking aesthet-
ic is called matching on action. Ifa
character is shown raising an apple
to his mouth, the next shot will
show him taking a bite, and the
shot after that will be the apple in
his hand lowering to his waist. The
conclusive action to which the shot
cuts must match the shot that pre-
ceded it - directionally, spatially,
temporally. Matching on action
preserves a film's sequential conti-
nuity. To ignore this rule - to skip
the bite - would prove immensely
disconcerting to the audience.
Naturally, Scorsese doesn't
just disregard this law, he aggres-
sively violates it. Throughout the
film, Daniels will hear a noise and
his head will already be turned
when the shot cuts, or his wife
will approach him with arms out-
stretched and suddenly they're
already locked in an embrace. It's
unnerving, it's clearly purpose-
ful, and it makes the audience look
around and wonder if anyone else
saw it. In a movie about a missing
crazy person on an island full of
crazy people, Scorsese makes the
viewer feel like the crazy one.
"Shutter Island" is wholly
arresting. Its artistry succeeds
on a level that contemporary hor-
ror films can only achieve in their
dreams. And though its surprise
is undeniably disappointing, the
manic path that leads to its conclu-
sion is only further thrilling evi-
dence of Scorsese's mastery.

Blue falls to lowly Penn State

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
These days, it's almost not
worth asking Michigan coach
John
Beilein
if his PENN STATE 55
0 team's MICHIGAN 51
team's
most
recent loss is frustrating. For that
matter, it's not worth asking any
of his players the question, either.
The answer is always, "Yes,"
followed often by silence and a
gloomy look, more dispirited than
angry.
Penn State's 55-51 victory over
Michigan on Saturday - its sec-
ond Big Ten win of the season -
was just the latest salt added to
the wound that is the Wolverines'

2009-10 campaign. And it became
another addition to the growing
list of frustrating losses.
"There's no question about
it," Beilein said in the postgame
press conference. "Sometimes,
you're helpless, you're absolutely
helpless in it - and I know those
times are helpless. But I know
we're capable of more."
The Wolverines shot 35 percent
from the field and just 21 percent
from beyond the arc. And Michi-
gan didn't make much of its miss-
es, failing to scramble to collect
offensive rebounds. Excluding
senior forward DeShawn Sims,
who pulled down two on one play,
the team combined for just five
offensive boards. The defensive
glass wasn't much better, and the
Nittany Lions outrebounded the

Wolverines by 14.
Penn State, the team sitting at
the bottom of the Big Ten rank-
ings, went ice cold late in the
second half. The Nittany Lions
were held scoreless for more than
seven minutes near the end of the
game, and they scored just two
points in the final 7:50.
But those two points came
to Penn State on its most criti-
cal possession of the game, with
under a minute to play in regula-
tion. After 39 minutes dominated
by streaky shooting and scoring
on both sides, the Nittany Lions
clung to a two-point lead as the
clock ticked down.
The Crisler Arena crowd
expected Penn State to give the
ball to its star, junior guard Talor
Battle, for the shot that could put

the game away. But he dished the
ball to junior forward Jeff Brooks.
"I know I definitely expect-
ed (Battle) to take the shot,"
junior guard Manny Harris said.
"(Brooks) stepped up, made a big
shot - credit him. I wish it would
have went the other way, but it
didn't. That's it."
Brooks's mid-range jumper put
Penn State up four points with 14
seconds left, which proved to be
an insurmountable lead.
"I think we had good looks, we
just missed shots," said Harris,
whose personal 7-0 run brought
the Wolverines within two before
Brooks's shot. "They made big
plays."

matchup didn't look like it would

Olver solemnly shook hands

the ground, not looking anyone in
the eye after Michigan's 5-4 win.
Just moments before, he had
missed a point-blank opportunity
to tie the game and send it into
overtime. Junior goalie Bryan
Hogan blocked a shot and the
rebound bounced right to Olver's

with less than a minute remain-

collectively exhaled.
The eighth-leading scorer in
the country just plain missed it.

wondered after the game.
After losing 3-1 Friday, Michi-
gan's win Saturday came in a
back-and-forth contest that
included multiple comebacks
by the Wolverines. After falling

able to string together quick-hit-

Due to a lingering hand injury
involving a sprain to his middle
and index fingers, nationally
ranked junior Chris Cameron was
unable to compete in his normal
events. He did compete in the
rings and high bar, as they were
the only events that would not
strain his hand too much.

ters."
Cameron said he wasn't sure

when he'd be back to full steam.
"It's really hard to tell," he
said. "It's just a sprain and I got it
x-rayed and there's no fraction or
broken bones. I've been surprised
how much it's been bothering me
from day to day, but no matter
what, I'm going to load it up and

unable to match Oklahoma after
poor performances in its parallel
bar and vault routine, largely due
to a low hit percentage and failed
dismount landings.

gan coach Kurt Golder said. "We
dug more holes than we could get

Taylor's no-hitter lifts
'M' to tournament win

An escape from
Olympic boredom

In five games over
three days, Blue
shows resiliency
with 4-I record
By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
No-hitter? No problem.
Junior pitcher Jordan Taylor
threw a gem for the Wolverines
this past weekend, improving to
5-0 and logging her first com-
plete game no-hitter of the sea-
son in a 7-0 win over Oklahoma
State on Friday.
With solid pitching, smart
defense and an explosive offense,
the No. 4 Michigan softball team
(6-2) showcased its complete
arsenal this past weekend, win-
ning four out of five games at the
Tiger Classic in Baton Rouge,
La. The three-day tournament
culminated with an 8-1 win over
Oklahoma State in the champion-
ship game on Sunday.
"We're all about playing
Michigan softball, staying in the
moment, making your pitches
work," Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said. "We don't get
caught up in who we're playing,
we worry about playing good
softball."
In the championship game,
Oklahoma State got on the board
first in the second inning but the
Wolverines didn't panic. They
resorted to their strengths -
offense and pitching - to cruise
to victory.
Taylor stayed calm and pitched
six strong innings, allowing one
earned run while striking out
eight.
"Jordan's a great pitcher,"
Hutchins said. "I'm most pleased
with the consistency she's shown,
not just in her performance but
in her pitch-to-pitch approach.
Right now, she's pitching well,
she's very focused and she's play-
ing one-pitch softball, and that's

I don't know about most of you
out there, but, for me, there's always
been something lacking in the Win-
ter Olympics.
Don't get me wrong, I've still
been watching as much as I can in
between cram-
ming for my
last midterms.
Any time Shaun
White does hiss

dream about
how much better
my life would be ANDY
if I were him. REID
But, whenI
compare these
to the summer games - especially
2008's drama-filled event in Beijing
- I have been really struggling to
get into it.
Maybe my eye is just too
untrained to see the differences
and little quirks, but there's only so
many times I can watch a person
ski down a hill or skate on a sheet of
ice before it all starts to look exactly
the same.
And it's not like I don't "get" it.I
grew up in Michigan, and I've been
snowboarding since I could strap
on a board. Only now, after watch-
ing so many people race the same
course over and over, do I appreci-
ate what my mom did for me back
then, sitting ina ski lodge and pre-
tending not to be bored to tears as
I waved to her from the bottom of
the hill.
Part of the problem stems from
NBC's coverage of the games. The
diversity and variety of events cho-
sen for broadcast and the amount
of airtime for live events haven't
been great. I think they did a bet-
ter job two years ago, but that's for
another column altogether.
Long story short, I was about to
give up on Vancouver 2010.
Then, one day after class last
week, I found my personal Winter
Games savior.
I got home and plopped down on
the couch. One of my housemates
had absentmindedly turned on NBC
or one of its affiliates while he was

surfing the Internet.
It just happened to be curl-
ing, and I've just happened tobe
enthralled ever since.
I wish I could tell you more
about why I find the sport so damn
intriguing. It's slow-moving, highly
mental and it appears as if the phys-
ical qualifications for athletes range
from Extreme Couch Potato to Pro
Bowling Association member.
Not to mention that I could prob-
ably watch an entire season of The
Wire in the time it takes for them to
play one game - or is it a match? Or
a set? I don't know. Whatever, you
get the point.
ButI can't look away. The USA
women's 6-5 win over Great Britain
- which ended in the 11th after the
English screwed up on a very make-
able toss (at least, I think that's what
happened) - was probably the most
exciting thing for me during the
Olympics so far. It was incredible.
I'm starting to pick up on the
rules. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but
the winner of each round is the one
with a stone closest to the middle.
Then, the winning team gets one
point for each stone they have
closer to the middle than the other
team's closest stone. Whew. Con-
fused? Yeah, me too, a little.
But that's part of the fun. That's
what I've been looking for. The
Summer Games offer a myriad of
sports that seem exotic and fun
- handball, water polo, fencing.
The best part of watching them is
learning how they're played as you
watch. You get invested, and even
if America's not in it anymore, you
still care.
What's there to figure out about
most Winter games? You go down-
hill. Maybe do a flip. Maybe, on very
rare occasions, shoot a gun. But
curling offers that same kind of fun.
And, America or no America, I'll
be glued to my TV next Saturday for
the gold medal game. And by then,
I'll at least know what's going on.

her key to success."
Saturday was a quiet day for
the Wolverines' bats. Though
Michigan beat No. 19 Louisiana
State 2-0, the Wolverines fell 2-1
to unranked Virginia. Hutchins
stressed the fact that the Wolver-
ines must be firing on all cylin-
ders to perform at their best.
'If pitchers do their part, the
hitters have their part to do,"
Hutchins said. "Yesterday's game
against Virginia, it's quite obvi-
ous that our hitting didn't do
their part. Our defense didn't
play as well as it could, and our
hitting did not do its part. But
when we all do our part, you'll
see good things occur, such as
W's. W's are good."
On Sunday, the Wolverines
got a much-needed spark from
their offense. Michigan scored
in every inning from the third on
and scored three runs in both the

fourth and fifth innings.
Sophomore left fielder Bree
Evans highlighted the Wolver-

from the leadoff position helped
seal the Wolverines' win.
"I just felt a lot more relaxed
this weekend," Evans said. "I
tried to not to have anything
affect me. It helped that I didn't
let my last setback affect my next
at bat. All I'm trying to accom-
plish is getting on base, because
if I get on base then I know my
team can make something hap-
pen and get the first run across."
In addition to boosting their
confidence with early season
tournaments, playing five games
in three days is a good endurance
test for the Wolverines.
"It's a grind," Hutchins said.
"By game five, we looked tired.

When we get into the confer-
ence season, we'll only have to
play two games in a weekend, so
it will seem like a piece of cake.
But each pitch in every game we
play is so intense. You evolve as
the season goes on, but these five
game weekends, they're tough."
With two early-season tour-
naments out of the way, includ-
ing a win at the Tiger Classic,
Michigan heads to into the rest
of its season with an agenda: to
surpass last season's Women's
College World Series appearance
with an NCAA National Champi-
onship.
"I think that fans should be
excited because our team is on a
mission," Evans said. "We want
to win it this year and we know
that we're capable of winning it.
We're going to do anything we
can to win the national champi-
onship this year."

Junior Botterman leads Wolverines to
climactic late upset of fifth-ranked Utes "

By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan coach Bev Plocki
watched her final gymnast dash
across the floor and land with ease
in the corner of the mat. Plocki
looked down, smiled and gave a
confident fist-pump.
Plocki had just seen junior Kylee
Botterman end the evening with
a season-high 9.950 score on her
floor routine, effectively complet-
ing the Michigan women's gym-
nastics team's surprise victory
over No. 5 Utah at Crisler Arena.
The 16th-ranked Wolverines
battled back from earlier mishaps
on the uneven bars and the bal-
ance beam to top the Utes in the
final rotation, winning by a score
of 195.725-195.100.
It was an evening that ended in
climactic fashion with a floor per-
formance that had the crowd on its
feet.
"I was just thrilled," Plocki
said. "We feel like we're a very
good floor team ... and we hit the
routines so we got good scores. I

knew that when Kylee hit that last
tumbling pass we had secured the
win."
As Michigan (3-0 Big Ten, 9-1
overall) headed to its final event -
the floor routine - it was trailing by
three tenths of a point, and it took
three near-perfect runs to over-
come the deficit.
The final athletes, senior Sarah
Curtis, freshman Natalie Beilstein
and Botterman, posted scores of
9.900, 9.875 and 9.950 respectively.
Although the balance beam has
been the biggest weakness this sea-
son, the major scares against Utah
(5-2) were on the uneven bars,
where two Wolverines and a Ute
all fell.
"Our struggles have been on
beam," Plocki said. "So to come
off of an event where we had
an uncharacteristic fall, and go
straight to beam, the pressure was
definitely on."
The team took the challenge and
posted good scores on the beam,
with senior captain Kelsey Knut-
son taking her fourth beam title
of the year by tying a season-high

score of 9.875.
But it was the strong start on
vault and a better finish on the
floor that propelled Michigan to
the upset.
"We needed to put together four
good events to come away with
a win," Plocki said. "This wasn't
Utah's best night, but we also
counted a fall on the bars. It was
very big for us to start off strong
on vaulting, and that kind of set the
tone for the meet."
Botterman and Curtis were sta-
bilizers throughout the evening,
offering very consistent perfor-
mances to take the top two spots in
the all-around. Both athletes took
one event title each and tied for
first place on the uneven bars.
Ultimately, Bottermanedgedout
her teammate by just one tenth of a
point with a 39.475 performance.
"(Sarah) and Kylee both, I put
them in the same category," Plocki
said. "They have been perform-
ing well all season, and they both
had great nights tonight in the all-
around."
With her dual meet-clinching

floor routine, Botterman matched
her career high on that event, tak-
ing her fifth all-around title in
seven meets this year.
"I'm always excited to perform
floor," Botterman said. "I don't
usually get nervous, and I defi-
nitely wasn't nervous. It's always
fun when I know I'm going to hit
my routine, I have that confidence,
and I can help my team to a win."
Regardless of any early slip-ups,
when it came down to crunch time,
the team pulled it together.
Before the first performer took
her place on the floor routine, the
team gathered on the mat. After a
few words from coaches, the ath-
letes huddled alone and prepared
for the final rotation.
Botterman added some insight
into the last-minute huddle.
"We always .say, 'For the
strength of the pack is the wolf,
and the strength of the wolf is the
pack. Let's Go Blue,"' she said.
As a team, the Wolverines need-
ed all they could get from every
member of the pack to pull off an
upset, and they got it.

Michigan finishes third at Big Ten Championships

By FELIX CARREON
Daily Sports Writer
WEST LAFAYETTE - It was a
day of pivotal rematches for the No.
16 Michigan women's swimming
and diving team on the final day of
competition at the Big Ten Champi-
onships.
Both fifth-year senior Emily
Brunemann and senior Margaret
Kelly looked to avenge second-place
finishes in the 1,650- and 100-yard
freestyle at the Boilermaker Aquat-
ic Center, respectively.
Brunemann started the
66-length race strong, leading the
field of competition through the
first 200 yards. Competing side-
by-side, Brunemann went stroke
for stroke with Minnesota's Ashley
Steenvorden.
But much like their previous
meeting, Steenvorden took over
the race. At 500 yards, she gained
a slight edge she didn't relinquish.
The final 100 yards proved to be a
race for second, one Brunemann

would eventually lose as the fifth-
year senior touched the wall third,
nearly four seconds behind Steen-
vorden.
"Not defending my tile was really
hard," an emotional Brunemann
said. "That's my event and that's my
favorite event. But that's something
that I chose, I chose not to taper for
(Big Tens) and I chose to taper for
NCAAs. But it doesn't make it any
easier."
The performance was a micro-
cosm of the meet as a whole; the
Wolverines placed third (462.5)
behind No. 10 Minnesota (572.5)
and Big Ten champion No. 14 Indi-
ana (758).
"We knew that on the psych
sheet, coming in that first or sec-
ond were really not realistic for us,"
Michigan coach Jim Richardson
said. "We knew we'd be in a tight
fight with Purdue and Ohio State
and maybe Wisconsin. I'm really
proud of this team, they really
stepped up."
Just days earlier, the Wolverines

had an opportunity to overtake
Indiana, the defending Big Ten
champions.
The team was trailing 276-252.5
heading into the finals of the 100-
yard butterfly. Kelly posted the
fastest preliminary time and was
considered by many to be the favor-
ite in the event. The Ann Arbor
native posted a fast pace to begin
the race but then faded in the wan-
ing moments to finish in a close sec-
ond by six hundredths of a second.
Indiana's Donna Smailis touched
the wall first in the event giving the
Hoosiers an edge over Michigan
that they never relinquished. A vic-
tory by Kelly would have given the
team a slight 306.5-304 advantage
over the Big Ten favorites.
It wouldn't be the last time that
Kelly would square off against
Smailis with an individual Big Ten
title on the line.
The 100-yard freestyle provided
more of the same drama. In an event
that she's doesn't typically swim,
Michigan's all-everything swim-

mer held her own. Standing in fifth
place after the first 50 yards, the
senior quickly made up ground, but
would have to settle for third place.
But all was not lost for the Wol-
verines, if anything they may have
found an heir to Kelly's throne as
Michigan superstar swimmer.
In her first Big Ten meet, fresh-
man Mattie Kukors put on one heck
of a show. In her first final of the
meet, Kukors touched the wall fifth,
but she didn't stopthere. The new-
comer also registered fourth-place
honors in the 400-yard individual
medley and earned a victory in the
consolation B final of the 200-yard
backstroke.
Knowing that Richardson still
has depth, despite the third-place
finish, puts the team at ease with
the season winding down.
"This team is amazing this year,"
Brunemann said. "In the five years
that I've been here, this is the clos-
est and best team I've been on. And
that's why. I think so many people
are so emotional."

After the No. 3 Michigan men's
gymnastics team lost by a little
more than four-tenths of a point to
No.2 Oklahoma on Saturday after-
noon, it was hard not to wonder one
thing.
What
if Chris AMY
Cameron PARLAPIANO
was at full
strength? On Men's
Cameron, Gymnastics
who was just
named to the
U.S. Senior Men's National Team
for the third consecutive year, has
placed in the top five individual
scores on the floor, pommel horse
and parallel bars in each match he
has performed in at full strength,
dating back to the home opener
againstPenn State on Jan. 24.
His injury, which he described
as a sprain of the middle and index
fingers, kept him from competing
in all three of those areas on Sat-
urday.
And in what could be seen as
a direct result of his absence, the

team's weakest events on Saturday
were the pommel horse and the
parallel bars, where the Wolver-
ines scored a 56.650 and 55.900,
respectively. Compare that to'
when Cameron led the Wolver-
ines to a 57.750 on the pommel
horse and a season-high 58.450 on
the parallel bars Jan. 30, and it's
obvious that his absence had an
impact.
Afterward, Cameron expressed
frustration at not being able to
compete, but was optimistic about
the team's strength. He noted that
the team scored one of its lowest
scores of the season on the pom-
mel horse and still tied Oklahoma
in that category.
"We definitely could have won
without Chris's other events,"
senior Mel Anton Santander said.
It's safe to say that's true. Had
they eliminated the bobbles on the
parallel bars and perfected their
dismounts, the Wolverines likely
would have picked up that extra
.45 that would have given them
the victory.

"But Chris could have been a
huge factor into winning today,"
Santander continued.
Also true. His presence on the
parallel bars and pommel horse
was definitely missed.
The main question here is not
how weak are the Wolverines
without Cameron, but how much
better than everybody else would
they be with him?
Michigan and Cameron will
attempt to answer that question
as Cameron said he continues to
take all the necessary precautions
to heal his hand as quickly as pos-
sible in the five weeks leading up
to the Big Ten Championships.
And when they arrive April 2, he
will be out there competing in all
six events, "no matter what."
The bottom line is that the dif-
ference between Michigan and
Oklahoma's final score was assmall
as four tenths of a point. The dif-
ference between Michigan being a
great team and being the best team
in the country is as big as Chris
Cameron.

'M' ice dancers, Davis and
White, stand in second place
after original dance round

VANCOUVER, British Colum-
bia (AP) - Sizzle beats buzz.
Canada's Tessa Virtue and
Scott . Moir won the original
dance Sunday with a sultry, fiery
flamenco number that reduced
the uproar over the Russians'
aboriginal routine to background
noise.
Virtue and Moir, medalists
at the last two world champi-
onships, scored 68.41 points to
edge Americans Meryl Davis and
Charlie White. With 111.15 points

overall, Virtue and Moir lead
Davis and White - their training
partners - by 2.60 points going
into Monday night's free dance.
Davis and White's Bollywood-
style dance is a feast for the
senses, packed with so many
interesting body movements
and complicated steps that one
almost doesn't know where to
look. Make no mistake, though,
they did more than just look
pretty.
They were so fast they prac-

tically sprinted across the ice,
yet they stayed in character
throughout and never once lost
the playful facial expressions
that transported the audience to
a wedding in Mumbai. And for
anyone who questions whether
ice dance is a sport, just watch
their twizzles - spinning turns
- that they paired with arm and
hand movements. Know how

facet of the game.
"The imperfections that
you try to cut down during the
season," Michigan coach John
Beilein said. "When a few of them
happen again, it's very frustrat-
ing."
After shooting a combined 47
percent from the field in those
two road wins and 51 percent
from 3-point land, Michigan
returned to its old ways this
weekend, shooting 35 percent
from the field and 21 percent from
beyond the arc.
It's tough to say a team's shoot-
ing deteriorated because it's not
necessarily something teams can
control. But still, it looked like the
team was breaking out of its sea-
son-long shooting slump-over the
past two games. After Saturday,
we can draw the conclusion that
the "slump" is simply the way
things are, and any night the per-
centage is above 40 percent from
the field and 30 percent from long
range is just an anomaly.
But it was easier to see the
regression in other aspects of the
game. Perhaps the most evident
was Michigan's defense.
Other than Darius Morris,
who played lockdown defense
on Penn State star Talor Battle,
the defense went the way of the

offense: streaky.
"When we haven't shot well,
we are a distracted team," Beilein
said. "Now you're thinking about
the missed shot and not getting
the loose ball. You're thinking
about it on defense."
This has been a problem the
entire season. When Michigan
shoots poorly, its defense suffers.
And this is literally the exact
opposite of the way a basketball
team needs to operate. It's easier
said than done, but when a team
misses shots, it needs to play even
harder on defense to make up for
it. It's true you can't control when
shots fall, but you can always
control defense. It's what coaches
tell you in the third grade, and
it's still true in college. Michigan
seems to still be figuring it out.
After keeping the rebounding
margin relatively close the past
two games, on Saturday, the Wol-
verines were outrebounded by 14.
While it's true that Michigan was
missing more shots than Penn
State - which gave the Nittany
Lions more opportunities for
defensive rebounds - that's still
a pretty big number. Not many
teams can win when they get out-
rebounded by that margin.
So where exactly is rock bot-
tom? Is it losing at home to a team
that had one Big Ten win this sea-
son before Saturday? I'm not sure.
Right now, rock bottom looks a
lot like a bottomless pit.

high bar.
"If we could have performed
on one more event like we did
on the high bar I think we
would have come away with a
victory."
Michigan faced a marginal
deficit going into the final rota-
tion, down by 3.5 points.
The high bar has always been
a strong routine and after sweep-
ing the event with top perfor-
mances by Kelley, redshirt senior
Ryari McCarthy and senior Mel
Anton Santander, it looked like
the Wolverines were going to
make a comeback. They came up
just short.
Kelley was a bright spot for
the Wolverines placing first in
the still rings and high bar, and
second in the parallel bars and
all-around competition.
Other bright spots for the
Wolverines included Santander's
first-place finish in the pommel

from a secondary scorer. It was
truly a team effort to make the
comebacks. And the goals weren't
exactly tic-tac-toe plays - they
were dirty, workman-like goals.
The Wolverines made their own
luck Saturday after not having
much on Friday. In the first game+
of the series, Michigan fell down
0-2 in the middle of the first period
and couldn't score more than one
goal on 39 shots. The Wolverines
ended up losing the game 3-1.
The power play especially
struggled on Friday as Michigan
finished the game 0-8 with the
man-advantage with 16 shots. But
the Wolverines used the power
play to come back Saturday and
scored two crucial goals. One gave
Michigan the lead in the second
period, and the other was Lan-
glais's tying goal in the third.
The poise and energy with
which Michigan played Saturday
to come back is something the
Wolverines have been trying to
harness all season. The Wolver-
ines have been improving in that

they hadn't won a game at Crisler
in more than a decade. Meanwhile,
Michigan had just reeled off two
straight road wins for the first time
in the Beilein era. But after a four-
day layoff, the momentum didn't
seem to carry over into Saturday's
horse and third-place finish in
the high bar.
Prior to Saturday's loss, Mich-
igan hadn't really been tested
much all season.
"It was the first meet where
somebody came in here and they
could beat us," Cameron said.
"It's just fun to have that excite-
ment and that motivation behind
you."
With another challenge ahead
for the Wolverines next week,
facing No. 4 Stanford in Palo
Alto, Calif., they will need to be
more successful in some aspects
of their routine to a legitimate
contender.
Michigan will look to use
this narrow defeat as fuel for its
upcoming schedule which only
gets tougher.
"As a team it was slightly dis-
appointing," Santander said.
"We could have done a lot better.
We're just going to have to prac-
tice in the gym and transfer our
training in the gym into compe-
tition when the pressure is actu-
ally on."
area, though. And junior forward
Carl Hagelin said that the team has
been playing better from behind
since winter break.
Friday's 0-2 deficit just ended
up being too large of a mountain
to climb. Michigan dropped to
0-9 on the season when the oppo-
nent scores the first two goals of
the game, and the team was 2-12-
1 entering the weekend when its
opponent scored first. Comebacks
have not been common.
Now, with just one more regular
season series remaining against
Notre Dame next weekend, the
Wolverines are almost out of
chances to improve their seventh-
place standing in the CCHA.
The interesting question going
into the Notre Dame series and
the CCHA Tournament will be
whether the Friday night Michi-
gan squad or the Saturday night
comeback kids come to play.
And to think that all of those
comebacks were almost for naught
if Olver was able to put away his
final chance. It sure makes the Wol-
verines that much more humble.
"You just feel like it's a lucky
win," Berenson said. "But it's
important that we won."

game against Penn State (2-12 Big
Ten, 10-16 overall). That, in itself,
was a cause for frustration.
"Very irritating," Harris said.
"We're all disappointed."

Blue stumbles at home

By ZELL ZOERHOF
Daily Sports Writer
This season, the Michigan's
women's tennis team has flown up
the rankings to No. 7 - its highest
ranking in program history- by
priding itself on excellent doubles
play and sound all-around game.
But, this weekend in Durham
N.C., the Wolverines faced sixth-
ranked defending national cham-
pion Duke who showed Michigan
what they lacked to take the next
step toward a championship, beat-
ing the Wolverines 5-2.
Michigan got out to a fast start
claiming the doubles point, which
has been crucial to its success. In
a lineup change, juniors Whitney
Taney and Rika Tatsuno were
moved up to first doubles, where
they earned a victory 8-5.
The duo of sophomore Michelle
Sulahian and freshman Mimi
Nguyen continued its success in
doubles as they defeated the No. 28
Duke pairing, the first victory over
a ranked doubles opponent. They
pushed forward as a team and
were able to finish the points off.
"We were playing outdoors, and
I kept shanking balls," Nguyen
laughed. "My first thought was to
not shank any balls, but Michelle
and I have been solid all season
and we were really confident in

our ability that we could beat that
team."
After her victory in doubles,
Nguyen - with the best record
of any Wolverine, continued her
flawless play and dismantled
Duke's No. 73 Monica Gray 6-1,
6-2, without dropping serve and
earning her third win over a
ranked opponent.
"Duke was a good team," Nguy-
en said. "But we're a good team,
and I was confident that I could
handle my opponenet."
But after Nguyen's victory, the
match got away from Michigan.
Four of Duke's five ranked singles
players - besides Gray - picked up
their play by out-manuevering and
out-hitting the Wolverines. A 2-1
lead soon turned into a 5-2 defeat.
Junior Denise Muresan found
herselfin another very tight match.
In a very close tie-breaker, she lost
the first set by just one point on her
service game 7-6 (7-5). Then, after
Duke had clinched the match, she
fell in the second set 6-4;
Against No. 47 Blue Devil Eliza-
beth Plotkin, senior Tania Mahtani
claimed the first set in a tie-break,
but could not hold on. She was only
able to hold serve once in the next
two sets while losing 6-7, 6-0, 6-1.
Despite the loss, Michigan had
many positives.
For one, the Wolverines showed

that they can play with the pre-
mier programs in the country. And
it demonstrated once again that its
doubles teams are to be feared for
they can beat anyone on any given
day.
"At one point, we could of won
the match," coach Ronni Bernstein
said. "We were playing the defend-
ing national champs, and there
was a time when we would play
Duke and wouldn't have a chance,
but the team is getting better and
we feel we can play with anyone."
. This match gave the Wolver-
ines insight into what they must
become as the season goes along in
drive, in terms of grit and mental
toughness. They took the lead in
the match, but could not finish it.
Muresan could not convert in the
tie-break and Mahtani was not the
same player after she took the first
set. They need to be able to finish
matches against the top programs
as the season goes along if they
have hope of contending.
Next- week, Michigan returns
to play against two ranked team
in No. 23 TCU and No. 5 Baylor. It
will look to use this new experi-
ence to develop a more balanced
game which it will need to prove
itself worthy of its new ranking.
"Hopefully next time we can
win those big points, and win
those big matches," Bernstein said.

After earning the doubles point
in impressive fashion over No.
22 North Carolina, the Michigan
men's tennis team looked poised for
a huge upset last night at the Var-
sity Tennis Center.
But the Tar Heels' strong singles
play gave them a 6-1 victory.
With wins by the pairs junior
Jason Jung and freshman Evan
King at first doubles and senior cap-
tain George Navas and senior Mike
Sroczynski at the second spot, the
Wolverines (3-4) took the early 1-0
lead in the dual match. They earned
the point as a result of taking two
out of three doubles matches.
The Wolverines have won the
doubles point in six out of seven
matches, despite a 3-4 record. The
script for last night's match was the
same, but the Tar Heels turned it on
once singles started.
"The thing you've gotta remem-
ber is once the doubles point is over,
it's a brand new match," said junior
Chris Madden after last week's win
over Notre Dame. "If we were 5-1,
we'd think it's the most important
thing ever but we're not. We've lost
matches when we've won the dou-
bles point and we've won matches
when we've lost it, so it's kind of
a thing where it's a great start its
great momentum, but you've gotta
just start over once singles starts."
North Carolina wasted no time

capturing the lead, winning the
first set in five out of six singles
matches, with Madden being the
lone Wolverine with a lead after a
set. The Tar Heels' depth was too
much for the Wolverines to handle
- five of of North Carolina's six
starters are ranked in the top 125 by
the ITA.
Three of North Carolina's singles
wins came in straight sets. No. 67
Evan King lost at second singles,
and George Navas was beaten at the
number four spot. And with a win
over freshman Chris Cha at num-
ber six, Andrew Crone gave North
Carolina a commanding 3-1 lead.
Needing just one win for the
victory, North Carolina seemed
slated to run away with the win.
But Michigan's remaining singles
players fought hard and all three
matches were forced into pivotal
third sets.
In the end, it wasn't enough, as
all three Tar Heels prevailed. No.
38 Clay Donato overcame No. 33
Jung at number one in a third-set
tiebreaker, while Mike Sroczynski
and Chris Madden were outlasted
at numbers four and five, respec-
tively.
"They were the better team
tonight," Michigan coach Bruce
Berque said. "I feel like we had the
skills to win the match, but these
three guys did a really good job
competing and all of those matches
could have turned on a point or two
here or there, but we happened to

lose them all in the end. I was dis-
appointed with a couple of spots
because I don't feel like we played
our best."
. Despite the seemingly lopsided
loss, Michigan certainly proved it
has the firepower and resilience to
compete with the best of the best.
"I don't think we had any doubts
that we can play with the top teams
in the country," Berque said. "I
know our ranking is a lot lower,
but we don't think of ourselves as
where we are in the rankings. But I
guess we have to prove that we can
not only play with them but also
beat them, which I surely think
we're capable of doing, we just
haven'tpulled it through yet."
With the win, North Carolina
improved to 6-2 on the year, and
10-0 all time against Michigan. All
seven of Michigan's dual matches
this year have been against teams
ranked in the top 55 in the nation.
Also, six of its 18 opponents this
season are currently in the top 15,
and 14 are in the top 50.
"Our growing pains wouldn't
hurt so much if we didn't have such
a tough schedule," Berque said.
"But I told our guys we're not going
to apologize for scheduling teams
at the level we think we should be.
So it would be pretty easy to have
a much better record and for every-
one to think we're wonderful but
we made the choice to try to chal-
lenge ourselves and we aren't going
to back down from it."

Coming off the bench, senior
guard Kalyn McPherson tried to
breathe
one last WISCONSIN 73
breath of MICHIGAN 61
life into
the Michigan women's basketball
team's chances yesterday against
Wisconsin in Crisler Arena.
McPherson's season-high eight
points helped the Wolverines jump
out on a 14-8 run, cutting a double-
digit deficit to just four with four
minutes to go.
But that's as close as Michigan
would come in its 73-61 loss - the
Wolverines' third straight defeat -
in a stretch where the regular sea-
son begins to wane and the team's
NCAA Tournament hopes begin to
fade.
Michigan's play was especially
porous in the first half, when they
committed 16 turnovers.
"We were being just a bit too
timid, and not being aggressive
enough," junior guard Veronica
Hicks said. "I think with the ball,
we just weren't being strong or
aggressive enough and it led to
those turnovers."
Taking care of the ball wasn't
the only problem.
The Wolverines continued to
struggle with their shot for the
third straight contest, hitting just
37 percent against the top scoring
defense in the Big Ten.
"We never had any good looks
from the outside," Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth said. "Not any to
speak of."
And the Wolverines (6-10 Big
Ten, 14-12 overall) weren't pro-
ficient enough on the other end
of the court to make up for their
offensive woes.
The Badgers went 14-of-28 from
the field in the first half and hit 46
percent of their shots overall.
"The first half we just had
some miscommunications as far
as screens went ... and they were
getting some offensive rebounds
and put-backs," Hicks said. "We
flattened out in the first half, and
we dug ourselves in the hole, and

It was in the year 1925 that The
New Yorker magazine was created,
the Scopes trial was held and The
Great Gatsby was published.
That was also the last year that
the Michigan wrestling team went
winless in the Big Ten.
The Wolverines came into Evan-
ston trying to close out the regular
season on a high note, but they ulti-
mately fell to the Wildcats 20-16,
finishing 0-8 in the conference and
4-15 overall.
"In some areas we have
(improved)," Michigan assistant
coach Kirk Trost said. "In others, I
think we have a long ways to go, in
just being consistent in our wres-
tling, in what we're going out there
to do."
The meetstartedoutinpromising
fashion for the road team. Redshirt
freshman heavyweight Ben Apland
secured an 11-2 major decision vic-
tory over an overmatched opponent.
Northwestern's Marcus Shrews-
bury began the season in the 184-
pound weight class but moved up
two classes to compete as a heavy-
weight. Apland used his weight
advantage and superior aggres-
siveness to tire out the Wildcat

wrestler, keeping him constantly
secured on the mat.
But the Wolverines failed to cap-
italize on their early momentum,
dropping their next four matches.
The losses were particularly disap-
pointing for Michigan because its
grapplers scored first on three of
the four occasions and were unable
to maintain their leads.
Most heartbreaking for the
Wolverines was 141-pound sopho-
more Mark Weber's defeat. The
Goodrich, Mich. native held a 5-3
lead late in the third period, but
his opponent, Northwestern's Levi
Mele, managed a two-point take-
down with just seconds remaining
and quickly notched another one in
overtime to steal the match.
Adding to the disappointment is
the fact that the Wildcats forfeited
every single Big Ten 141-pound
match until Sunday and that Mele
was wrestling above his weight class.
Though the Wolverines would
rebound to win three of the final
five matches, it wasn't enough to
overcome the Wildcats' lead.
Redshirt freshman Hunter Col-
lins' victory at 184 pounds was one
of the few Michigan highlights.
The young grappler was able to
quickly dispatch his counterpart,
pinning Northwestern's Aaron


Jones after only-2:48 had eclipsed
in the match. Collins had momen-
tum coming into the meet, having
defeated then-No. 16 Travis Rutt of
Wisconsin last weekend.
"He fought off a couple of
attacks by the other kid," Trost
said. "That's just what we're trying
to get, is the guys to keep wrestling
and fighting to win these matches
in the last month."
The team's futility is not overly
surprising. Coming into the season,
with such an inexperienced squad,
the Wolverines knew that 2009-10
would be a difficult campaign.
But though the team experi-
enced another disappointing meet
loss, there is little time to sulk.
Michigan is hosting the 2010 Big
Ten Championships March 6-7,
and despite a disappointing regular
season, the group still has goals it
aims to accomplish.
"Just hoping that these guys,
some of them who have struggled,
throw their best wrestling together
and put aside some of the mistakes
that have been made and have a
good weekend performing," Trost
said. "Being as young as we are, the
more guys we can get through to
the.NCAA Tournament, it'll give us
a lot more experience coming back
for nextyear."
