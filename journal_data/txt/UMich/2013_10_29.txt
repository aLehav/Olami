process and its economic impli-

- The singular theme across
the Obama administration's

according to Munoz, is its effort
to drive the middle class for-

growth. Immigration reform,
she said, "is squarely part of that
agenda" for middle-class pros-

into four "policy buckets."
The first bucket deals with
enforcement, as a secure bor-
der is essential to successful
immigration policy, Munoz said.
In addition to improving bor-
der security, the Department

of Homeland Security would
need to accelerate its efforts to
remove undocumented immi-

serious crimes, been previously
deported or recently arrived to
the United States.
The second bucket, Munoz
said, involves addressing the
11-million undocumented work-
ers who are integrated into
workforces and communities
across the country.
The framework behind this
part of the proposal Munoz
said, is to create a mechanism
to get undocumented workers
"on the right side of the law" by
having them come forward, get
provisional status with a green
card and then wait in line with

EVENT PREVIEW
* DAAS poetry
series to feature
Detroit writer

BOO000!

Alum to speak on
literary beginnings,
'activist' label
By CAROLYN DARR
DailyArts Writer
Tuesday, the Department of
Afroamerican and African Stud-
ies will again host a poetry read-
ing as part of its ongoing Living
Poets Series. The featured speak-
er this week is Melba Joyce Boyd,
a visiting professor who is a Uni-
versity alum and local Detroiter.
Boyd, the poet for this year's
event, is a Distinguished Profes-
sor and Chair of Africana Studies
at Wayne State University. She
has written 13 books and has won
multiple literary awards includ-
ing the 2010 Library of Michigan
Notable Books Award.
"She's an incredible poet, she's
a life long Detroiter and she's
also an incredible activist," said
V. Robin Grice, the DAAS gal-
lery manager who organized the
series. "Her name is really well
known, and a lot of people know
her as an activist, other people
know her as the chair at Wayne
State, and other people know her
as a poet, so it's going to be nice
for people to understand that
she's all of those things."
Boyd opened up about the
importance of poetry in society
today.

"I think probably in every situ-
ation, it has more to do with our
creating and conveying ideas
and issues that affect people on
a global level," Boyd said. "Creat-
ing those ideas and reconfiguring
themin such away that you're giv-
ing insight rather than just a sort
of typical way of looking at what
people think might be important."
Though many consider her to
be an activist, Boyd does not nec-
essarily identify herself as such.
However, from her college ,years
protesting the assassination of
Martin Luther King, Jr. to her
current poetry, Boyd continues to
speakout against injustice toward
Black Americans and American
society as a whole.
"I don't think about labels,"
Boyd said. "You do certain things
and people kind of begin to refer
to you as an activist. I think an
activist is a person with a certain
level of consciousness, and then
they incorporate that conscious-
ness into whatthey do."
Boyd said she considers herself
primarily a writer, both as a poet
and a scholar.
"I think because I am an Afri-
can American Studies scholar,
it put me in the position where
the work I was doing was activ-
ist work illuminating that reality
and that history and that culture,
which I think is a form of activ-
ism," Boyd said. "That's the expe-
rience that has nurtured me and

Michigan recieves
second-most grants

By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
Thirty-three University stu-
dents were recipients of the
Fulbright grants, the second-
greatest number of grants to be
awarded to a university this year.
Names of recipients are not yet
available.
The Fulbright grant is a pres-
tigious government award that
funds research and education
programs overseas for up to a
year. About 1,800 are given to stu-
dents per year.
Seven University faculty mem-,
bers from Ann Arbor were also
awarded Fulbrights in the scholar
category, and a faculty member
from the Flint campus received a
Fulbright specialist grant.
Coming in at 39 recipients,
Harvard University was the only
institution with more honorees
than the University of Michigan,
one of whom was a student at
UM-Flint.
Two students declined their
grants to pursue other oppor-
tunities and two elected to par-
ticipate in Egypt, which has been
suspended for the 2013-2014 aca-
demic year.

Great Lakes watershed sees

Coastal storm leaves 13

first spawning of Asian Carp dead in U.K. and Europe

Invasive species
reproduces, threatens
native fish
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP)
- Scientists said Monday they
have documented for the first time
that an Asian carp species has suc-
cessfully reproduced within the
Great Lakes watershed, an omi-
nous development in the struggle
to slam the door on the hungry
invaders that could threaten
native fish.
An analysis of four grass carp
captured last year in Ohio's San-
dusky River, a tributary of Lake
Erie, found they had spent their
entire lives there and were not
introduced through means such as
stocking, according to researchers
withtheU.S.GeologicalSurveyand
DRnlin&( raan CtntP T Tnivxrci+tr

Grass carp are among four spe-
cies imported from Asia decades
ago to control algae and unwanted
plants in controlled settings such
as sewage treatmentlagoons. They
escaped into the wild and have
spread into the Mississippi and
other rivers and lakes across the
nation's heartland.
Of greatest concernin the Great
Lakes region are bighead and sil-
ver carp, prolific breeders that
gobble huge amounts of plankton
- tiny plants and animals that are
vital to aquatic food chains. Scien-
tists say if they gain a foothold in
the lakes, they could spread widely
and destabilize a fishing industry
valued at $7 billion.
Grass carp are less worrisome
because they eat larger plants
instead of plankton and don't com-
pete with native species, although
they could harm valuable wetland
vrertationxwheroe sonAfishsn.rn

But because all Asian carp spe-
cies require ' similar conditions
to reproduce successfully, the
Sandusky River discovery sug-
gests it's likely that any of them
could spawn there and in many
other Great Lakes tributaries, said
Duane Chapman, a USGS fisher-
ies biologist and member of the
research team.
"It's bad news," Chapman said.
"It would have been a lot easier to
controlthese fishifthey'd beenlim-
ited in the number of places where
they could spawn. This makes
our job harder. It doesn't make it
impossible, but it makes it harder."
The Obama administration has
spent nearly $200 million to shield
the lakes, focusing primarily on
an electrified barrier and other
measures in Chicago-area water-
ways that offer a pathway from the
carp-infested Mississippi River
watershed to Lake Michigan. Crit-
ics say more is needed and are
pressing to physically separate the
two systems.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers is scheduled to release a
report in coming months on a long-
term solution.
JohnGoss, who heads the White
House Council on Environmental
Quality's Asian carp program, said
sterile grass carp have been found
in the Great Lakes for years. But
the discovery that they can repro-
duce within the watershed "rein-
forces why we must continue to
execute the aggressive strategy to
keep silver and bighead carp out of
the Great Lakes that we have been
pursuing for the past three and a
half years," he said.
A commercial fisherman cap-
tured four small grass carp from
the Sandusky River in 2012. Chap-
man and his colleagues determined
they were at least a year old and
could become spawning adults.
The scientists also examined
bones in the fishes' heads called
"otoliths" that indicate the chem-
istry of the waters they've inhab-
ited, and they compared them
with otoliths of farmed fish. The
analysis confirmed the grass carp
were hatched through natural
reproduction in the river.

Hurricane-force
winds fell trees,
tangle traffic
LONDON (AP) - A savage
coastal storm powered by hur-
ricane-force gusts slashed its
way through Britain and west-
ern Europe on Monday, felling
trees, flooding lowlands and
snarling traffic in the air, at sea
and on land. At least 13 people
were reported killed.
It was one of the worst
storms to hit the region in
years. The deadly tempest had
no formal name - and wasn't
officially classified as a hurri-
cane due to a meteorological
standard - but it was dubbed
the St. Jude storm (after the
patron saint of lost causes) and
stormageddon on social net-
works.
Gusts of 99 miles per hour
(160 kph) were reported on the
Isle of Wight in southern Eng-
land, while gusts up to 80 mph
hit the British mainland. Later
in the day, the Danish capital of
Copenhagen saw record gusts
up of to 120 mph (194 kph) and
an autobahn in central Germa-
ny was shut down by gusts up
to 62 mph (100 kph).
All across the region, people'
were warned to stay indoors.
Hundreds of trees were
uprooted or split, blocking
roads and crushing cars. The
Dutch were told to leave their
beloved bicycles at home for
safety's sake.
At least thirteen storm-
related deaths were reported,
most victims crushed by fall-
ing trees. Germany had six
deaths, Britain had five and the
Netherlands and Denmark had
one each. One woman was also
missing after being swept into
the surf in France.
Two people were killed in
London by a gas explosion
and a British teen who played
in the storm-driven surf was
swept out to sea. A man in

Denmark was killed when a
brick flew off and hit him in
the head.
Despite the strength of its
gusts, the storm was not con-
sidered a hurricane because it
didn't form over warm expans-
es of open ocean like the hurri-
canes that batter the Caribbean
and the United States. Britain's
national weather service, the
Met Office, said Britain does
not get hurricanes because
those are "warm latitude"
storms that draw their energy
from seas far warmer than
the North Atlantic. Monday's
storm also did not have an
"eye" at its center like most
hurricanes.
London's Heathrow Air-
port, Europe's busiest, can-
celled at least 130 flights and
giant waves prompted the
major English port of Dover to
close, cutting off ferry services
to France.
Nearly 1,100 passengers
had to ride out the storm on a
heaving ferry from Newcastle
in Britain to the Dutch port of
Ijmuiden after strong winds
and heavy seas blocked it from
docking in the morning. The
ship returned to the North
Sea to wait for the wind to die
down rather than risk being
smashed against the harbor's
walls, Teun-Wim Leene of
DFDS Seaways told national
broadcaster NOS.
In central London, a huge
building crane near the prime
minister's office crumpled in
the gusts. The city's overbur-
dened transit system faced
major delays and cancella-
tions and did not recover even
once the weather swept to the
east.
A nuclear power station in
Kent, southern England, auto-
matically shut its two reactors
after storm debris reduced
its incoming power supply.
Officials at the Dungeness B
plant said the reactors had
shut down safely and would be
brought back once power was

restored.
The storm left Britain in the
early afternoon and roared
across the English Channel,
leaving up to 270,000 U.K.
homes without power.
Trains were canceled in
southern Sweden and Den-
mark. Winds blew off roofs,
with debris reportedly break-
ing the legs of one man. Near
the Danish capital of Copen-
hagen, the storm ripped down
the scaffolding from a five-sto-
ry apartment building.
Copenhagen's Kastrup Air-
port saw delays as strong gusts
prevented passengers from
using boarding bridges to dis-
embark from planes to the ter-
minals.
In Germany, the death
toll hit six, with four people
killed in three separate acci-
dents Monday involving trees
falling on cars, the dpa news
agency reported. A sailor near
Cologne was killed Sunday
when his boat capsized and a
fisherman drowned northeast
of the city.
In addition to widespread
rail disruptions, both Dues-
seldorf and Hamburg airports
saw many flights cancelled,
stranding more than 1,000
passengers.
Thousands of homes in
northwestern France also
lost electricity, while in the
Netherlands several rail lines
shut down and airports faced
delays. Amsterdam's central
railway station was closed due
to storm damage.
In France, maritime offi-
cials were searching for a
woman who was swept into
the turbulent Atlantic by a big
wave Monday as she walked on
Belle Isle, a small island off the
coast of Brittany.
"We are focused on the
search," Yann Bouvart, of the
Atlantic Maritime Prefecture
told BFM-TV. He said a heli-
copter, a boat and an inflatable
Zodiac were looking for the
woman.

restrictions place an unconstitu-
tional burden on women seeking
to end a pregnancy, a ruling that
keeps open dozens of abortion
clinics across the state while
officials appeal.
The ruling by District Judge
Lee Yeakel came one day before
key parts of the law the Legisla-
ture approved in July were set to
take effect. Lawyers for Planned
Parenthood and other abortion
providers argued in their lawsuit
that a provision requiring abor-
tion doctors to have admitting
privileges at a hospital less than
30 miles away would have effec-
tively shuttered about a third of
the state's 38 clinics that per-
form abortions.

WASHINGTON
White House
considering ending
spying on allied
countries
The Obama administration
is considering ending spying on
allied heads of state, a senior
administration official said, as
the White House grappled with
the fallout from revelations
that the U.S. has eavesdropped
on German Chancellor Angela
Merkel.
The official said late Monday
that a final decision had not been
made and an internal review was
still underway.
The revelations about Nation-
al Security Agency monitoring
of Merkel were the latest in a
months-long spying scandal that
has strained longstanding alli-
ances with some of America's
closest allies. Earlier Monday,
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chair-
woman of the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee, called for a
"total review of all intelligence
programs."

IMMIGRATION
From Page 1
people going through the legal
immigration process. Duringthis
provisional period, the people in
this category would have to pay
taxes, pass English examinations
and pay fees - a proposal Munoz
said is cumbersome but fair.
The third bucket focuses on
reforming the existing legal
immigration system, which
Munoz called "broken and badly
backlogged."
The immigration system is
comprised of a family-sponsored
process, in which legal citizens
and residents cats petition for
family merbers to receive visas
and ai employer-sponsored pro-
cess, in which companies try to
do the same for people they'd like
to hire.
Both systems have not been
updated since 1991, according to
Munoz.
One highlight of the proposed
legislation is the creation of a
new visa category for people
with advanced degrees in sci-
ence, technology, engineering
and mathematics fields.
"We train the best and the
brightest from all across the
world at our institutions of
higher learning, especially in
STEM areas, where we have
great needs for workers and tal-
ented people," she said. "Then
we don't make visas available for
them to stay."
Such a predicament, Munoz
said, illustrates why employ-
ment-based and family-based
immigration reform efforts need
to be combined, rather than
be framed in opposition to one
another.
The final policy bucket
addresses how the government
will deal with the low-sectorr
labor stream after immigration
reform is implemented. Immi-
gration policymakers expectthat
there will still be some demand
for the low-wage labor.
Instead, Munoz said the pre-
ferred proposal is to acknowl-
edge that such a labor force
exists, structure it by providing
a path for people to get in the
country and create a temporary-
worker designation that provides
am eventual pathway to citizen-
ship.
"The challenge here is to come

up with a process that protects
the rights of workers inthese sec-
tors in the U.S. from competition
and protects immigrant workers
from being exploited," Munoz
said.
While there has been some
support to achieve immigration
reform in a piecemeal fashion,
Munoz argued that the com-
plexity and' interconnected-
ness of each policy component
demonstrates that none of the
pieces will move by themselves,
only as a part of a broader
reform effort.
Munoz also touted the poten-
tial reform bill's economic
benefits. According to the Con-
gressional Budget Office, the
proposed Senate bill would
increase GDP by 3.3 percent by
2025. Munoz added that it'would
have positive effects on innova-
tion and job creation, as well as
reduce the deficit by $800 billion
over the next in 25 years.
Though political impedi-
ments will be one of the biggest
obstacles toward moving for-
ward on immigration, Munoz
said the country's immigration
debates have always reflected
both where we were at the time
and the notion of immigrants as
the country's lifeblood.
"This law, if it passes, will
shape who we are just as much
as failing to pass it will shape us,"
she said.
Munoz, a Detroit native with
Bolivian immigrant parents, had
a full day on her return to cam-
pus, including a sit-down with a
group of policy students ina Pub-
lic Policy seminar on immigra-
tion reform.
Munoz also spoke with Pub-
lic Policy Dean Susan Collins,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, and Martha Pollack,
provost and executive vice presi-
dent of student affairs.
In an interview before the
lecture, Munoz reflected on
the impact her experience as
an undergraduate had on her
future career path. Her daugh-
ter is currently a University stu-
dent.

Allegations of U.S. spying
in Europe makes waves

Sen. Feinstein
calls for 'total
review' of U.S.
intelligence
BERLIN (AP) - The Unit-
ed States could lose access
to an important law enforce-
ment tool used to track ter-
rorist money flows, German
officials said Monday, as
Europe weighed a response to
allegations that the Americans
spied on their closest European
allies. ,
In Washington, Sen-
ate Intelligence Committee
Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein
called for a "total review" of
all U.S. intelligence programs
in response to the allega-
tions - activity the California
Democrat said she wasn't told
about.
Feinstein said that while her
committee was informed of the
National Security Agency's col-
lection of phone records under
a secret court order, it "was not
satisfactorily informed" that
"certain surveillance activi-
ties have been in effect for
more than a decade" - includ-
ing eavesdropping on German
Chancellor Angela Merkel's
own cellphone.
She said President Barack
Obama was also not told that
Merkel's communications were
being collected since 2002.
"With respect to NSA col-
lection of intelligence on
leaders of U.S. allies-includ-
ing France, Spain, Mexico
and Germanylet me state
unequivocally: I am totally
opposed," Feinstein said in a
statement Monday.
"Unless the United States is
engaged in hostilities against
a country or there is an emer-
gency need for this type of sur-
veillance, I do not believe the
United States should be col-
lecting phone calls or emails
of friendly presidents and
prime ministers," Feinstein
said. "The president should be
required to approve any collec-

tion of this sort."
Spain became the latest U.S.
ally to demand answers after
a Spanish newspaper reported
.that the NSA monitored more
than 60 million phone calls in
that country during one month
alone. The report Monday in
the daily El Mundo case on
the heels of allegations of mas-
sive NSA spying in France and
Germany.
With European leaders dis-
satisfied with the U.S. response
so far, officials have been cast-
ing about for a way to pressure
Washington to provide details
of past surveillance and assur-
ances that the practice will
be curbed. The challenge is to
send a strong message to Wash-
ington against wholesale spy-
ing on European citizens and
institutions without further
damage to the overall trans-
Atlantic relationship.
As possible leverage, Ger-
man authorities cited last
week's non-bindingresolution
by the European Parliament
to suspend a post-9/11 agree-
ment allowing the Americans
access to bank transfer data
to track the flow of terrorist
money.
German Justice Minister
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnar-
renberger said Monday she
believed the Americans were
using the information to gather
economic intelligence apart
from terrorism and that the
deal, popularly known as the
SWIFT agreement, should be
suspended. That would rep-
resent a sharp rebuke to the
United States from some of its
closest partners.
"It really isn't enough to be
outraged," she told rbb-Info-
radio. "This would be a signal
that something can happen and
make clear to the Americans
that the (EU's) policy is chang-
ing."
Suspending the agreement,
officially known as the 'Terror-
ist Finance Tracking Program,
would require approval by an
overwhelming majority of the
28 European Union countries.
The agreement allows access to



funds transferred through the
private, Belgium-based Soci-
ety for Worldwide Interbank
Financial . teleconmmunica-
titn, which handles the move-
ment of money between banks
worldwide.
Asked Monday if the NSA
intelligence gathering had
been used not only to protect
national security but Ameri-
can economic interests as well,
White House spokesman Jay
Carney said: "We do not use
onur intelligence capabilities
for that purpose. We use it for
security purposes."
Still, he acknowledged
the tensions with allies over
the eavesdropping disclo-
sures and said the White
House was "working to allay
those concerns," though
he refused to discuss any
specific reports or provide
details of internal White
House discussions.
The German justice min-
ister's comments follow days
of vocal indignation in Berlin
after German news weekly Der
Spiegel reported the NSA had
kept tabs on Merkel's phone
calls since as early as 2002,
three years before she became
chancellor.
Merkel said Friday that she
was open to the idea of sus-
pending the SWIFT agree-
ment, saying she "needed to
look at this again more closely"
and weigh "what we will lose
for the security of our citizens
and what we don't."
Germany and other Euro-
pean governments have made
clear they don't favor suspend-
ing the U.S.-EU trade talks
which began last summuer
because both sides stand to gain
so much through the proposed
deal, especially against com-
petition from China and other
emerging markets.
Still, the Europeans have said
they will insist that the trade
agreement includes stronger
rules for protecting data as a
result of the NSA allegations.
Data protection laws in Europe
are generally stronger than in
the United States.

What the frack?
Fracking regulation isn't an alternative for alternative energy
Since hydraulic fracturing - a complex procedure to extract natural
gas from underground shale - began in Michigan about 50 years ago,
approximately 12,000 wells have been fractured in the state. Given the
significant environmental health concerns, and unanswered questions asso-
ciated with the process, often called fracking, and because the Great Lakes
contain about 21 percent of the world's fresh water resources, several cam-
paigns in recent months have demanded a ban on fracking in the state. Michi-
gan's Department of Environmental Quality released a proposal Oct. 22 for
updated fracking regulations for greater transparency. This added oversight
is a firm step toward holding companies more accountable for their actions
and potential damage. However, the DEQ should not lose focus on finding
alternative energy sources as these regulations go into effect next year.

The proposed regulations begin to bring
clarity to an industry clouded by trade secrets.
Better monitoring of water withdrawal, water
quality sampling, chemical additive disclosure
on an Internet-based platform and more fre-
quent reporting by operators would be required
if the regulations are instituted. While these
requirements don't prohibit the pollution
causes, they provide a greater understanding of
fracking's effect on the environment.
Michigan should also be taking into account
the debates and attempted regulations that
have occurred elsewhere in the United States.
In Ohio, where more than 80,000 oil and gas
wells have been fractured since 1951, the state
Senate passed regulations on oil and gas drill-
ing in May 2012, including hydraulic fractur-
ing. Although both Niles and Youngstown city
councils in Ohio ultimately turned down the
proposed ban on fracking within city limits,
the local administrations appear to be more
concerned and involved in the decision-making
than in Michigan. In Pennsylvania, the Mar-
cellus Shale Law, which was scheduled to take
effect in April 2012, was supposed to change
the zoning laws applicable to Marcellus Shale
well drilling. However, it has been delayed due
to a growing group of municipalities and orga-
nizations asking for a more regulation powers
in their localities.
Giving local authorities more control
over fracking protocols in Michigan would
allow for greater public representation in the

decision-making process and make a larger
portion of the local population aware of the
potential effects of fracking. Additionally,
Wyoming voted in 2010 to require full disclo-
sure of fluids used in natural gas exploration
through fracking. The proposed forms of dis-
closure in Michigan have not been elucidat-
ed yet, but public disclosure of information
should be required in order to further engage
its citizens and increase transparency in the
fracking process.
While the efforts to guarantee responsible
fracking are laudable, it has shifted focus from
advancements being made in other forms of
energy harvesting. The Michigan Public Ser-
vice Commission and the Michigan Energy
office have reported that the state should be
capable of tripling their renewable energy
use by 2035, with utilities required to get 30
percent of energy from renewable resources.
Currently, the state hopes to achieve 10 per-
cent by 2015. Specifically, advancements have
been remarkable in wind technology, with the
first wind farm - built in Mason County last
year - generating 103 megawatts of electricity
since opening. More farms are planned for the
future, and the state should begin shifting its
attention toward alternative energy.
While fracking has made for an excellent
short-term investment, the enormous devel-
opments in renewable energy technologies
signal that alternative energy is a more sus-
tainable investment for Michigan.

Watching Francis' obsessive atten-

I understood his mocking as self-

To the man who tried to intrude

Sometimes I make the mistake of telling
someone I meet here that I'm not that into
sports. I know I'm entitled to my own inter-
ests and opinions, but there's an unspoken
rule about being a University student that says
you have to either care alot about football, or
pretend you care a lot about football. While I
may not understand the rules or exactly what's
happening at a given athletic event, there is
one thing I'll admit to appreciating: the school
spirit. Undoubtedly, that's one of the most
obvious perks of going to school here; the stu-
dents love their school, and they show it.
In perfect harmony with the students, the
Athletic Department spews school spirit 'in
the form of weekly pre-game e-mails, social
networking and now, a monstrous digital bill-
board, complete with sound capabilities, that
was constructed over the past summer. Con-
veying promotional messages for the Michi-
gan Athletic Department, this sign, situated
between the Big House and the Crisler Center,
had to be huge to match up with the massive
size of our football stadium. And, according
to Athletic Director Dave Brandon, the sign
"won't annoy anybody" because it "happens to
be right across the street from a golf course".
There are just a few problems with this -
the first being a factor of safety. The big, bright
nature of the digital billboard provides a sub-
stantial distraction to drivers. This was pre-
dicted by Ann Arbor City Council members
leading up to its construction, and has been
proven true in the opinions of residents.
Further, the city council amended the out-
door advertising ordinance to prohibit the
conversion of standing traditional billboards
into digital ones. While the University of
Michigan doesn't have to obey these ordinanc-
es and is free to build all the huge electronic
disturbances it wants, the ordinance shouldn't
have been disrespected in this way. A number
of residents have reported it as blight on the
city - a misrepresentation of what Ann Arbor

is about.
At some universities, the school and its clos-
est neighboring city work as separate entities
and are barely associated with one another.
The appeal of attending the University of
Michigan is that the school is so intertwined
with the city of Ann Arbor. For this very rea-
son, Michigan should be collaborating with
the city, not against it. Ann Arbor is what gives
the University so much of its beauty and ambi-
ance, and the University shouldn't take actions
to endanger this relationship.
Members of the city council plan on bring-
ing forward this issue at a Nov. 7 meeting.
While they'd prefer that the billboard be
removed completely from its East Stadium
Drive location, council members are willing
to compromise. They understand that the
Athletic Department wants to advertise dur-
ing games with this sign, and would agree to
it only being active during game day. How-
ever, if safety is in fact their biggest concern,
the amount of traffic on game day actually
makes that the worst time for the sign to be
functioning.
Finally, if the University is trying to go
green, the last thingthey need is a giant digital
advertisement consuming massive amounts of
energy every day. Recent studies have led sci-
entists to predict that the replacement of tra-
ditional billboards with electronic ones will
completely negate the recent efforts of electric
companies to reduce energy demand during
peak times. The University of Michigan should
act as aleader in lowering energy consumption
- which can certainly happen in unison with
our position as a leader in school spirit.
If not for the environment, or for the safe-
ty of drivers, the University should consider
removal of the digital billboard at least in
respect of the city of Ann Arbor and the opin-
ions of its citizens.

To the man in the pink bathrobe
who tried to get into my house
Saturday night:
You probably don't remember
any of this, so let me remind you.
You were in my neighborhood
around 1:15 a.m. There were a few
parties down the street, but you
were walking on a dark, poorly lit
road. My roommate was biking
home from work when you saw her.
Her bike lock wasn't working, and
as she was struggling with the com-
bination, you approached her. She
hurried toward our door. You fol-
lowed her into our building's hall-
way. She could hear your footsteps
behind her. She started running.
She made it to our door before you
did, slamming and locking it in your
face. You pounded on the door. You
waited. Inside the apartment, my
friends and I, all women, held our
breath. After a few minutes, we
could hear you turn and go through
the unlocked door of our female
neighbor's apartment. We didn't
know what to do. No one had our
neighbor's number, and we were
terrified to open our door, in case
you would come in. Although there
were four of us, and you were alone,
we were afraid of you.
After a minute passed, you left
our neighbor's apartment. She was
OK, and we were OK. You were
probably just another drunk guy

who had gotten separated from his
friends and was lost. You probably
meant no harm. But, despite your
intentions, you terrified me.
As a feminist, I'm struggling
with how to process these feel-
ings. I want to be able to say that
I wasn't afraid of you, that I stood
up to you and told you to go away.
I want to say that I never hesitated,
that I shrugged my shoulders and
said, "Poor dude, he must have been
wasted," like my male friends did
when I told them. I hate that I felt
so 'afraid of you - and so vulner-
able. I especially hate that the first
thing I did was text my boyfriend
in case I felt like he needed to come
over. It was scary to have a stranger
trying to get into my house, but the
scariest part of it was that you made
me feel instantly helpless, needing
a man's protection. Long after you
left, I couldn't stop thinking about
how small you made me feel.
The fact of the matter is that I
have every right to be afraid. One
in five women in the United States
report being sexually assaulted,
and around one in four women on
college campuses have experienced
rape or sexual assault. I am wary of
strange men because if I weren't,
I might be putting myself at risk. I
seek a man's protection because I
know that I am truly safest when
strange men see me as "claimed,"

as someone else's "property" - it
makes me sick to write this. I have
been socialized to be afraid for my
own self-protection. I know too
many women who have experi-
enced sexual assault; I myself have
experienced sexual harassment far
too often.
I could go on about rape'culture,
problematic language and gender
oppression. I could go on about
how sexism is hurtful to men, too.
I could write about how all day I've
been wanting to take a self-defense
class, buy myself some pepper spray
and keep the door locked, even
when I'm home. There's so much
more to say.
But this is what needs to be
said: The man in the pink bath-
robe frightened me last night, and
my feelings of fear are justified.
Women are not safe on this cam-
pus. But the solution should not
be that we must turn to men to
"protect us." The solution should
not be for women to lock our doors
and learn karate. What we need
is an open, honest dialogue about
gender relations on campus. What
we need is for men to be taught
not to rape, not to sexually assault
and not to see women as property.
What we need is a change in the
oppressive system.

PBS to examine
'Worlds' broadcast

A treatise to the macabre

'U' alum discusses
involvement in new
documentary
By NATALIE GADBOIS
Daily Arts Writer
According, to Twitter, the
world ended 10 months ago,
there is a 60-foot prehistoric
shark roaming the Pacific Ocean
and. human traffickers have
taken over a grocery store in
Grand Rapids, Mich. We have
a history of buying into these
sort of "panic stories," which
are only exacerbated by the
Internet's facilitation of instan-
taneous communication (and
miscommunication). This phe-
nomenon is not new, not another
black mark specific to the ledger
of our generation's faults. This
culture of panic was present
on Oct. 30, 1938, when Orson
Welles performed his notorious-
"The War of the Worlds" broad-
cast, which convinced nearly
one million people in the United
States that Martians were taking
over the Earth.
On Oct. 29, PBS's "Ameri-
can Experience" is releasing a
documentary about the event
and, because of his extensive
research into the aftermath of
the event, University alum A.
Brad Schwartz contributed as a
screenwriter for the film.
Schwartz sat down with the
Daily to discuss his involvement
in the project and his roots at the
University.
In part because of his child-
hood insomnia, Schwartz grew
up listening to old-time radio
including Orson Welles's famous
shows, so he has been familiar
with the broadcast for a long
time.
"It wasn't something I was
particularly interested in until

I came to the University," he
said, "And a librarian from
the (Screen Arts and Culture)
department, Phil Illman, came
in and gave a presentation about
all the library resources avail-
able to students. He had recently
in the past few years gotten two
big collections of Orson Welles's
personal papers."
Many people are unaware of
the vast amount of Welles materi-
al the University currently holds,
including letters sent to Welles
in the aftermath of the event,
which Schwartz discovered
while searching for a thesis topic.
Schwartz recognizes both the
Screen Arts and Culture depart-
ment and the Historydepartment
for giving him the tools to tackle
this exhaustive project.
"The two majors - history
and SAC - it's not a combination
many people consider, but the two
feed into each other really well.
My thesis got me the interest of
PBS, and then the screenwrit-
ing got me contacts in L.A., con-
nected me with a book agent to
write my book. They are two fan-
tastic departments that provided
me with opportunities I really
couldn't have had otherwise."
Schwartz, who graduated in
December 2012, was contacted
by PBS while still a student, as
he was the only person to have
catalogued the more than 1,400
letters sent to Welles. These let-
ters demonstrate the anger felt
by those who really believed that
their lives were at stake during
the "alien invasion," and dem-
onstrate the pervasive presence
of radio during this time. More
than just atale of the gullibility of
humans, "The War of the Worlds"
illustrates the power of the media,
even 75 years ago, in swaying the
outcome of a story.
"I think it's become this arche-
typal - almost mythological -
story about the power of media,"

Schwartz said. "Any time some-
thing happens in the news when a
Tweet or something has a partic-
ularly profound affect on people,
people say it's another 'War of the
Worlds."'
The way we communicate
has evolved so drastically since
1938 that it seems impossible
that a radio broadcast could be
absorbed with either such fear
or, as print journalists respond-
ed, with such vindictive deri-
sion.
"The development of the
radio and the birth of broadcast
radio was so very similar to how
the Internet is taking over the
news business today," Schwartz
said.
Radio was the newest tech-
nology, able to emotionally
connect with millions in a way
single newspapers couldn't -
an issue Schwartz found as a
recurring element in the letters.
"The press would try to
ignore radio, attack radio.
That's a lot of what 'The War
of the Worlds' fear was about
- newspapers attacking the
radio."
How often do we hear the
lamentation of the loss of books,
the complaints of older genera-
tions over the newfangled tech-
nology to which our generation
seems so attached?
"Even back then, they were
saying that newspapers were
dying, that print media was
dying," Schwartz said. "People
were going to listen to the radio
and weren't going to read books
or newspapers anymore."
While the social landscape
has changed rapidly over the
past few years, "The War of the
Worlds" is a prescient reminder
that these concerns aren't nec-
essarily new. Progress may not
mean the death of one outlet,
just the inauguration of anoth-
er.

of most audience members
because, yes, he stabs people
while they're naked, but he's
driven to do so because of the
stressed (understatement of
the century?) relationship he
shares with his mother. By
playing on this notion of moth-
erhood, director Alfred Hitch-
cock takes something as basic
as a classic family dynamic
and twists it beyond recogni-
tion, exaggerating to a point
where we begin to question the
validity of our own relation-
ships. That uncertainty is what
good horror is all about.
It's not the only reason the
film works, but it's a unifying
recurrence that lets the plot
stand.

"A murderer would never
parade his crime in front of
an open window." - "Rear
Window,"1954
Surprisingly, unexpected-
ness isn't the defining factor
for the last technique I'm
going to examine, one I've
seen pulled off effectively in a
single film, Hitchcock's mas-
terpiece, "Rear Window." The
movie is about a wheelchair-
bound photographer who
begins to suspect that the man
living across the street has
killed his wife (No, this is not
the one with Shia Labeuf).
Nearly every minute is pre-
sented to us from behind a
window, creating the detach-
ment through which Hitch-
cock crafts a false feeling of
safety.
By putting distance between
his protagonist and the source
of the conflict, the master
director forces us onto the
same page. After all, aren't all
trips to the movie theater, in
some form, just another way
of looking through a rear win-
dow? Throughout the course of
the film, nothing unexpected
ever really happens. It's two
hours of tedium, interjected at
choice moments by plot devel-
opments we saw coming from a
mile away.
The entire time, we know
the photographer's world and
that of the supposed murderer
are going to intersect. The
actual deconstruction of that
detachment is where Hitcheeck
excels, and where he leaves us
questioning, even if it's only
for a moment, our own safety
inside the cinema hall.
The idea of closing distance
is simple, but as I've said in one
of my previous columns, the
simplest mechanisms canyield
the simplest solutions (in this
case, the most effective scares).
Unfortunately, it requires
tense, slow setup - something

When I heard that Lou Reed

friends in Naguabo, Puerto

road in search of a restaurant

the cows to our east looked

We had Lou Reed.

fun for awhile, but at its core,
it's lazy storytelling that feels
tired after every re-entry.
For reference, see the
countless unnecessary
sequels to "A Nightmare on

sequels go against one of the
most basic rules of horror:

watching people who are per-

so to hide crippling mental

How three Wolverines helped a hero

By EVERETT COOK
Daily SportsEditor
Russell Bellomy thought a
semi had just driven by his house.
That's how loud the collision was.
Fifth-year senior offensive
tackles Taylor Lewan and Michael
Schofield heard the bang, too.
Upstairs, redshirt sophomore
linemen Jack Miller and Graham
Glasgow were sleeping, and so
were some teammates a few hous-
es down, including redshirt junior
linebacker Jake Ryan.
Schofield had just badly beaten
Bellomy, a redshirt sophomore
quarterback, in a game of NFL
Blitz on the house's Nintendo 64.
Lewan and Schofield remember it
as Super Smash Bros., but Bellomy
is positive it was NFL Blitz.
Outside, last Wednesday, it
looked like the beginnings of a
tornado, when the sky turns green
and the wind begins to whip and
there's a hint of impending fury.
There was smoke bellowing out
from somewhere down the street,
so Lewan and Schofield sprinted
over.
. Bellomy is out for the season
with a torn anterior cruciate liga-
ment. He didn't sprint to the crash.
The three Wolverines stopped
when they found the source of the
smoke: a car that plowed into the
porch of a house in between theirs
and Ryan's.
The car, going southbound on
South State Street, had hit a fire
hydrant next to Al Glick Field
House - where the football team
practices - before careening
across two lanes of traffic and hit-
ting a guard wire, the kind that
stabilizes power lines. The porch
finally stopped the uncontrolled
vehicle, and that's where Lewan,
Schofield and Bellomy stepped in.
Lewan and Schofield remember
pulling the driver out of the car .
and putting him on the ground,
where he regained consciousness.
The group later found out that
that the driver - whose name isn't
available due to privacy laws -is
diabetic. He was low on blood
sugar and had an uncontrollable
coughing attack, which led to a
rising heart rate, which led to a
blackout and complete loss of con-

up. The lawn lit on fire, as did the
sidewalk. Not a huge, raging fire,
but a fire nonetheless. The burn
scars are still there, on the same
sidewalk the Michigan players use
to walk to practice every day.
It was Lewan, the tattooed,
6-foot-8, 315-pound All-American
tackle, who helped to calm the
driver down until the ambulance
arrived about 10 minutes after the
players reached the scene.
"You know how Taylor is," Bel-
lomy said. "He can talk to anyone."

pretty localized.
The field hockey team was in
a meeting when the power went
out, so they went on a run and
saw the crash. Further down State
Street at Yost Ice Arena, the power
stayed on for the hockey team's
practice.
"I was talking with my family
and girlfriend about it," Bellomy
said. "Every three seconds, they
think of a new situation where
things could have gone worse."

For Wolverines, Nieves s
feet not translating to goals

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
If life is a highway, hockey is
the German autobahn with a few
daunting roadblocks along the
way- the defensemen.
And come game time, sopho-
more forward Boo Nieves is the
McLaren Fi, stuck in first gear.
Early in the second period
Friday against Boston Univer-
sity, Nieves turned a one-on-one
breakaway into a solo look at the
Terriers's net, faking right and
then blowing past a defenseman
with that familiar ease. Nieves
came equally close to scoring later
in the period during No. 4 Michi-
gan's second power play, but fell
into the net without the puck.
"I liked his energy on Friday
and the speed when he cut around
the defensemen twice and went
to the net," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "I thought his puck
touches, defensive awareness, and
his intensity and faceoffs were
right on. And on Saturday, he
never got that back."
At full speed, Nieves wove eas-
ily through traffic. But that's about
the only time he's given the crowd
something to marvel at this sea-
son. Before the season, Berenson
singled Nieves out as one'of sev-
eral players in need of a breakout
year for the Wolverines.
Through six games this season,
Nieves has only one goal and one
assist. Without utilizing much of
his signature speed, he has been
a non-factor in each of the Wol-
verines' four victories. He is on
pace for a repeat season - Nieves
tallied 29 points, including eight
goals and 21 assists in 41 appear-
ances as a freshman. But as one
of the Wolverines' key offensive
weapons - especially on a line
with junior forwards Alex Guptill
and Zach Hyman - cruising just
won't cut it.
The talent is there - we saw a
glimpse of that on Friday night.
Following the departure of five
Wolverines, Michigan's biggest
question mark heading into the
season was the special teams. Last
season, power-play production
fell largely on the shoulder of first-
year Winnipeg Jets defenseman
Jacob Trouba, while penalty kill-
ing was the job of former Wolver-
ines A.J. Treais, Lee Moffie, Kevin
Lynch and Jon Merrill.

offense.
He has the ability to create
offense simply by being fast on his
feet, said senior defenseman Mac
Bennett.
Bennett refers to Nieves's lack
of production as little more than

as the potential It would be misguided to assume
r a highly touted that Michigan lives and dies with

Nieves. But Michigan (4-1-1 over-
all) cannot afford for Nieves to
not produce in these games. And
for Nieves, it's a matter of simply
skating at top-speed in practice as
often as when the stands are filled.
"If you drive around in your car
on low gear all the time, you get
used to it," Berenson said. "Until'
someone shows you you've got
high gear."
It's also a, matter of know-
ing when to change gears. Once
Nieves finds the confidence to
press the pedal, the challenge
will be to know when to press the
pedal and when to lay off.
"You also can't drive your car
100 miles an hour when you're 50
feet from a stop sign," Berenson
said. "When you're on the high-
way, though, that's your opportu-
nity. Hockey is a game of intensity,
but it's a game of short sprints and
then every so often you get a
chance, and that's when Boo needs
to know he has that extra gear.
"With cement trucks out
there, you have to decide how fast
you're willing to go. There's a risk
involved in using that speed. Do
you want to go or is it safer to stay
here?"

'M' shows vast improvements
By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer '
Two weekends ago at the ITA/ UT Rgoa Tunmt,
USTA Regional Tournament,
the Michigan men'stennis team
struggled to find its bearings, '
not advancing anyone past the
second round. This past week-
end, though, at the Big Ten Indi-
viduals in West Lafayette, there
seemed to be a marked difference.
Seniors Shaun Bernstein and
Alex Buzzi each made it to the
singles quarterfinals, while
freshman Kevin Wong made it to
the singles consolation semifinals
after suffering a 6-1, 6-1 loss to
Jonas Dierckx of Iowa in the first
round. In the doubles bracket,
Bernstein and Wong - paired
together for the first time -
advanced to the semifinals before
being ousted by Michigan State.
