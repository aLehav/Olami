CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Deroy Murdock, columnist and Fox News contributor, speaks about race and politics at the “Blacks, Democrats, 
and Republicans: Modern Myths v. Historical Facts” event put on by the Young Americans for Freedom at the 
University of Michigan at the Rackham Building on Monday.

Senator argued 

absence of nuclear 
families hindered 
Black communities

By ALLANA AKHTAR 

Daily Staff Reporter

Members of the University 

community gathered in Weill 
Hall on Monday evening to dis-
cuss the political rhetoric and 
subsequent policy decisions of 

the widely controversial 1965 
Moynihan Report.

The report, written by Daniel 

Moynihan, former assistant sec-
retary of labor and U.S. senator, 
argues that the increasing pro-
portion of single-mother house-
holds in the Black community 
stemmed from a culture with ori-
gins in slavery and Jim Crow dis-
crimination, rather than a lack of 
jobs. The report argued that the 
absence of nuclear families hin-
dered the ability for Black com-
munities to achieve increased 
political and economic equality.

Both political liberals and 

conservatives have used the 
report to support their policy 
agendas.

The panel featured Daniel 

Geary, an assistant professor at 
Trinity College and author of 
upcoming book “Beyond Civil 
Rights: The Moynihan Report 
and its Legacy.”

Sociologist Anthony Chen, a 

former University faculty mem-
ber, and Sociology and Public 
Policy Ph.D. candidate Matthew 
Alemu also contributed to the 
discussion.

Geary said the report hurt 

efforts working toward racial 
equality, though it has received 
praise from both liberals and 
conservatives, citing conserva-
tive Washington Post columnist 
George Will and liberal New 
York Times columnistNicholas 
Kristof.

Geary said though both ideol-

ogies call for different programs 
to address inequity along the 
lines of race and class, they fail 
to address the underlying causes 
for Black family dynamics by 

City Council hears 

opinions on an 

alternative 

housing option 

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Citizens packed the Ann Arbor 

City Council chambers to nearly 
full capacity during Monday 
night’s meeting, as they orga-
nized to express concerns with an 
item that was not on the night’s 
agenda: accessory dwelling units.

Accessory dwelling units are 

additional housing units cre-
ated within an existing property, 
either in the main residential 
house or in an attached, addi-
tional house. Legalizing acces-
sory dwelling units is one option 
council is considering to help 
increase affordable housing in 
Ann Arbor. These units would 
potentially generate revenue to 
the homeowner and could be less 
expensive than traditional hous-
ing options.

Seven of the nine public com-

mentaries focused on the subject 
of accessory dwelling units.

Ann Arbor resident Luke Nor-

man spoke in support of accessory 
dwelling units, noting they would 
help foster affordable housing in 
Ann Arbor.

“Briefly legalizing accessory 

dwelling units would allow home-
owners to rent out a converted 
garage, or a basement or even 
a tiny house in their property, 
which is a great way to increase 
the number of affordable rentals 
we have in Ann Arbor.”

He said he requests that council 

allocate $25,000 for a consultant to 
review the existing plan in the zon-
ing code and to make recommen-
dations for how to best legalize 
ADUs. He also requested the plan-
ning commission and the planning 
department make the legalization 
of ADUs a top priority.

Ann Arbor resident Sand-

ers Hamson said he supports 
the above requests, as he would 
potentially consider offering an 
ADU for rent, and wants to know 
more about the process.

“One of the factors that would 

assist me in thinking about this 
possibility would be to see how it 

Democrats Eaton 
and Magiera begin 

campaigns for 
August primary

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Incumbent Jack Eaton (D–

Ward 4) will compete against 
challenger Jaime Magiera in the 
August Democratic Primary to 
represent the 4th Ward on the 
Ann Arbor City Council.

The 4th Ward is in the south-

western part of Ann Arbor and 
is partly bound by East Madison 
Street to the north and Pack-
ard Street to the east, with the 
northwest boundary encircled 
by the I-94 freeway. According to 
a Michigan Daily analysis, about 
20 percent of registered students 
live in the 4th Ward.

Eaton, an attorney, was elected 

to City Council in November 2013. 
He said the period since his elec-
tion to council has not been long 
enough for him to accomplish all 
the goals he set out to achieve.

“I think I’ve had some impact 

on the decisions made by coun-
cil,” Eaton said. “I would like to 
follow through and just make 
sure that we really pay attention 
to the fundamental services that 
a government should be provid-
ing.”

One of Eaton’s main concerns 

is how the city will allocate its 
money and he noted that the city 

needs to prioritize its spending.

“We are coming out of a pretty 

dramatic recession, and as our 
revenues increase I’d like to be 
there to help fashion where we’re 
going to allocate these resourc-
es,” he said. “I think this is a real-
ly important time to pay attention 
where we are spending money.”

While Eaton said he has helped 

rebuild Ann Arbor’s police and 
fire departments, he said as the 
city’s budget increases, initial 
cuts to these departments need 
to be reconsidered, and the city 
must decide how much money it 
should spend on public safety.

“If we’re careful with how we 

are spending the money that we 
have, we can address a lot of areas 
we neglected during the reces-
sion,” he said.

Eaton said his experience and 

critical voice on council has been 
key to making him a good rep-
resentative of his 4th Ward con-
stituents.

“I think that I bring a common 

sense perspective to City Coun-
cil,” Eaton said. “A healthy sense 
of skepticism, so that I do ask 
tough questions, make sure we 
are making good use of taxpayer 
revenues... I think I give a voice 
to the residents and the neighbor-
hoods in the 4th Ward.”

Eaton’s 
challenger, 
Jaime 

Magiera, speaks with a Daily 
reporter Sunday about how his 
past in information management 
would aid him if elected. (Allison

Speaker shares his 

views on race 
and Republican 
Party history

By COLLEEN HARRISON

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s chapter of 

Young Americans for Freedom 
brought Fox News correspon-
dent Deroy Murdock to campus 
Monday evening to discuss race 
and party affiliation.

Murdock, a longtime con-

servative and member of YAF, 
discussed the history of the 
Republican Party and its rela-
tionship with Black Americans. 
Murdock initially began work-

ing with YAF in high school, 
and continued his membership 
through his time at George-
town University.

“My basic message today is 

that the Republican Party and 
conservatives has spent most of 
the 150 years trying to liberate 
Black Americans,” Murdock said.

Since the University’s YAF 

chapter was founded last semes-
ter, the group has pushed for 
increased conservative discus-
sion on campus. This is the 
group’s second lecture event; the 
first hosted conservative author 
Jonah Goldberg in February.

LSA freshman Grant Strobl, 

chairman of the University’s 
chapter of YAF, said the group 
aims to promote conservative 
ideas on campus.

“We want to provide anoth-

er perspective on issues, we 
want to create more intel-
lectual diversity on campus,” 
Strobl said. “It’s unfortunately 
become a habit where alterna-
tive viewpoints have been shut 
down.”

Throughout Murdock’s talk, 

he discussed 150 years of racial 
movements in America. Mur-
dock said he considers the Dem-
ocratic Party racist, though he 
said he believes Republicans are 
often seen to be more racist of 
the two major political parties.

“While our side plays the 

race card very rarely, our oppo-
nents play the race card like 
a blackjack dealer in Vegas,” 
Murdock said.

Murdock also said several 

Democrats have had links to 

Neurologists 

reimbursed at lower 

rate for patient 

meetings

By KATIE PENDROD

Daily Staff Reporter

The care provided by neurolo-

gists more often consists of pro-
viding consultations to patients 
than performing tests and pro-
cedures, according to a study 
released last Wednesday. How-
ever, Medicare reimburses neu-
rologists at a lower rate for these 
face-to-face meetings, compared 
to services like a surgery or biop-
sy.

Led by Neurology Prof. Kevin 

Kerber, the study reviewed all 
Medicare payments to neurolo-
gists in 2012. The study found 
60 percent of the Medicare 
reimbursements paid to neurolo-
gists were classified as “evalua-
tion and management services.” 
These usually include the doc-
tor and the patient discussing 
conditions and the best methods 
of treatment or following up on 
chronic conditions.

Surgeons, for example, report 

providing far fewer of these ser-
vices, ranging between 15 and 51 
percent of their reimbursements.

Neurology Prof. Lesli Skolarus, 

one of the study’s researchers, 
said the majority of neurologists’ 
work is not procedural or surgi-
cal, but rather, involves meeting

LOL ROFL gets last laugh

DAVID SONG/Daily

Violinist Tsu-Hao Kuo plays Bach’s Fuga from Sonata 
No. 3 at Britton Recital Hall on Monday.

SONATA NO. 3

Business senior Daniel Gant-

man, is the president of the LOL 
ROFL Comedy Club. The club 
members meet weekly in Mason 
Hall to practice their stand-up 
comedy skills and skits. They 
host regular performances at 
BTB Cantina as well as end-of-
the-semester shows. 

What kind of subjects do you 

like to take on during your 

stand-ups?

There’s definitely stuff about 

myself, but really it’s just what 
I hear and absorb and I write 
down in my notebook. I don’t 
know, anywhere from mosqui-
toes to McDonald’s to tattoos.

What is your favorite joke 

to perform?

I have one that is kind of 

just nonsense. It doesn’t really 
make sense. At least everyone is 
confused when I am saying it and 
then it … kind of comes together 
in the end. I like that. More of the 
abstract jokes. Kind of like per-
formances that you don’t really 
think are going well and then 
end up going well. Rather than 
jokes that are, “This is difference 
between men and women.”

What’s the hardest part about 

doing stand-up?

If you asked me that my fresh-

man year, it would have been just 

going up and trying to tell your 
jokes and realize that you don’t 
know what you are doing. Now it’s 
just the time. I mean, in order to 
make it in stand-up or to actually 
be a confident stand-up comedian, 
you have to perform at least three 
times a week. 

What’s the best thing about 

being in the club?

All of my best friends are at 

ROFL. I don’t know what that 
says about me. Just meeting peo-
ple who love comedy as much as 
you do, especially stand-up com-
edy, is really cool because other 
people are really boring. These 
people are hilarious.

Ann Arbor based 
newsletter targets 
young professionals 
on seven campuses

By LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Young business professionals 

frequently reach out for a cup of 
coffee each morning in need of 
energy. Creators of The Morn-
ing Brew, a new free, daily busi-
ness newsletter, hope young 
business professionals will seek 
their product for a similar rea-
son.

Launched at the University 

in March, The Morning Brew 
is an e-mail newsletter that 
targets young, current or aspir-
ing business professionals. The 
e-mail arrives in subscribers’ 
mailboxes at 6:30 a.m. Monday 

through Friday. It takes about 
five minutes to read and is what 
founders call a “one-stop shop 
for everything business.”

“We hope that our subscrib-

ers will read The Morning 
Brew every morning and get 
their day going,” said Business 
sophomore Austin Rief, chief 
operating officer of The Morn-
ing Brew. “People who get their 
daily fix of caffeine with a cup 
of coffee will get their daily fix 
of business knowledge to help 
them throughout their day.”

After conducting an adver-

tisement campaign at the Uni-
versity, Rief said The Morning 
Brew has accumulated about 
1,500 subscribers and has 
been read in 35 states and in 
over 10 countries, thanks pri-
marily to students studying 
abroad.

The Morning Brew launched 

a campaign Monday to expand 
to seven additional univer-

sities — Indiana University, 
University of Southern Cali-
fornia, New York University, 
University of Pennsylvania, 
University of California, Los 
Angeles, Northwestern Uni-
versity and the University of 
Maryland.

The Morning Brew’s team 

is offering a monetary incen-
tive for the school that obtains 
the most subscribers. The team 
has produced and distributed a 
marketing guide, which details 
the results of their experience 
marketing at the University 
and offers suggestions for rep-
resentatives at their respective 
schools.

“Our plan is to grow this 

in the college market,” said 
Business senior Alex Lieber-
man, founder and CEO of The 
Morning Brew. “And then, 
come summer, bring this to 
all of the internship summer 
analyst classes in these major 
business cities — whether 
that’s L.A., Chicago, Miami, 
New York.”

The ultimate goal, he said, is 

to expand the newsletter to the 
general business world organi-
cally by way of graduating 
University students’ word of 
mouth, and also through mar-
keting strategies.

“Once we feel like we’ve 

tapped the college students, the 
college market, at that point 
down the road we want to basi-
cally get all of the business pro-
fessionals say, below the age of 
25 — the analyst who’s working 
in an investment bank for 14 
hours a day and only has five 
minutes to read his news on the 
subway,” Lieberman said.

Taking on a format similar 

to popular e-mailed newsletter 
The Skimm, The Morning Brew 
has four distinct sections on its 
interface.

The first section is called 

Market Corner. The caption 
reads, “Glimpse into the U.S. 
financial markets.” This sec-
tion holds four to five stories

SACA agrees to 

offer resolution in 
support of ad-hoc 

committee

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

The Senate Advisory Com-

mittee for University Affairs 
decided Monday to present a 
proposal supporting the cre-
ation of a University committee 
to consider divesting from com-
panies allegedly involved in the 
violation of Palestinian human 
rights.

During the meeting Monday, 

SACUA voted to present the 
proposal for consideration at 
next week’s Senate Assembly 
meeting.

A similar proposal was pre-

sented to Central Student Gov-

ernment last month by Students 
Allied for Freedom and Equal-
ity, the University’s chapter of 
Students for Justice in Pales-
tine. SAFE is a student group 
that advocates for Palestinian 
solidarity on college campuses.

The 
divestment 
proposal 

requested that CSG support the 
creation of a committee through 
the 
University’s 
Board 
of 

Regents to evaluate the Univer-
sity’s investments in The Boeing 
Company, Caterpillar Inc., G4S 
and the United Technologies 
Corporation. SAFE argues these 
companies profit from alleged 
human rights violations against 
Palestinians.

CSG voted down the proposal 

last week.

SACUA Chair Scott Masten, 

a professor of business econom-
ics and public policy, said he 
opposed bringing the proposal 
to next week’s Senate Assembly 
because he did not think SACUA 

should hold a singular opinion 
on policy.

“There’s scope for a lot of 

disagreement,” Masten said. “I 
think there’s a huge variety of 
opinion.”

Ecology 
and 
Evolutionary 

Biology Prof. John Lehman, 
SACUA member, said the only 
natural course of action was to 
form a coalition between stu-
dents and faculty to consider 
the issue.

“What we do is have some 

type of a task force that engag-
es with the students and see 
if there is a common ground,” 
Lehman said. “I don’t have a 
problem with that, and I feel 
like there are faculty members 
who would volunteer.”

Faculty members will consid-

er the proposal at next week’s 
Senate Assembly meeting.

Senate Assembly to vote 
on divestment resolution

each day, which are 60 to 100 
words each.

The next section is called 

“Water Cooler.”

“It’s kind of like when you’re at 

the office and you meet another 
employee at the water cooler,” 
Lieberman said. “It’s a more 
timely or cool topic — less mental 
power, more digestible and argu-
ably more interesting stories.”

The Water Cooler section will 

soon feature exclusive inter-
views with notable business pro-
fessionals conducted by staff of 
The Morning Brew, Lieberman 
added.

Penultimate is the section 

entitled “The Mix.” This sec-
tion 
features 
three 
distinct 

topic categories daily — “Build-
ing Blocks” for real estate news, 
“Today in Tech” for news in the 
world of technology and “Start-
up of the Day” for entrepreneur-
ial news.

The final section of the news-

letter is called “The Breakroom.” 

Lieberman 
said 
this 
section 

includes a “cool” business fact of

the day and a business fact of the

“That’s kind of when you get 

out of the office, kick your legs up 
on the table and just want to talk 
about whatever with friends,” 
Lieberman said.

Behind the scenes, the news-

letter is made up of an 11-person 
team — consisting of five writers, 
two editors, one grammar and 
spelling editor and LSA senior 
Grant Demeter from ComCo, a 
University comedy group, to give 
the newsletter some style.

“He puts in that witty, uni-

fied, singular tone,” Rief said. 
“We think that really adds a lot 
of value to our newsletter and 
differentiates ourselves between 
other dry business newsletters.”

The Morning Brew was not 

always so comprehensive. It used 
to be a one-man act.

Lieberman started the news-

letter last semester after recog-
nizing local interest.

“I spent two to three hours 

daily giving interview advice, my 
view on the business world, my 
view on the market to my friends 
in my fraternity, kids in the 
business school that were going 
through the recruiting process,” 
he said. “I decided there has to be 
a better platform to inform col-
lege student as well as young pro-
fessionals in general about what’s 
going on in the business world in 
a quick and quality way.”

For this reason, he created 

what he then called The Market 
Corner, a daily e-mail update 
he wrote and published in PDF 
form every day for two months. 
The Market Corner attracted 250 
readers.

“I wasn’t expecting it to be 

read by that many people,” 
Lieberman said. “It was like a 
small market test for the type of 
demand that was there for this

Officials investigate 
Nissan safety issues

The government is investi-

gating the Nissan Versa and 
Versa Note subcompact cars 
because the driver’s foot can 
allegedly get caught in the 
trim panel that holds the car-
pet.

The National Highway Traf-

fic Safety Administration has 
been looking into the issue 
since last June. This week, the 
agency said it is no longer look-
ing at 2012 and 2013 models of 
the Versa, which don’t have the 
same trim panel design. But it’s 
still investigating 360,000 cars 
from the 2014 and 2015 model 
years.

NHTSA 
has 
received 
at 

least one report of a crash in 
which the trim panel allegedly 
delayed the driver’s ability to 
apply the brakes. The driver 
sustained minor injuries.

misunderstanding the Moynihan 
report.

“Kristof and Will, following 

in a tradition nearly as old as the 
report itself, misrepresent the his-
tory of the report, misrepresent 
the controversy over the report 
and 
perpetuate 
a 
misguided 

approach to understanding racial 
and class inequality,” Geary said.

Geary said Moynihan pointed 

to the deteriorating structure of 
the Black family to explain high 
crime and unemployment rates, 
arguing for more advanced poli-
cy measures to address cultural 
challenges to inequality, such as 
full male employment. Geary said 
Moynihan framed policy issues 
of housing and employment dis-
crimination as family issues to 
appeal to white audiences.

Geary said the report encour-

aged Americans to focus on Black 
cultural traits instead of problems 
within the political economy, 
such as unemployment, educa-
tion, housing and taxes, to explain 
racial inequality.

“Racial and class inequality 

are again on the national agenda 
today just as they were years ago 
when Moynihan wrote, yet an 
ambiguous and flawed govern-
ment report written a half cen-
tury ago is hardly a good starting 
place for discussing these issues 
in our own time,” Geary said.

Geary said Black power advo-

cates criticized the report, argu-
ing it upholds white domination 
and creates a structure where 
white sociologists define Black 
culture.

He also said Black feminist 

critique of the report argues the 
report portrayed Black mothers 
as promiscuous and subservi-
ent to men. Geary said the report 
itself assumed the natural supe-
riority of two-parent household 
where the father is the main 
breadwinner. He used this argu-
ment to claim matriarchal culture 
of Black families was at fault for 
the racial inequality and that jobs 
given to Black women took neces-
sary jobs away from Black men.

“Critical commemoration of 

the report from conservatives 
and many liberals threatens, once 
again, to distract from real policy 
inequities and injustices in Amer-
ican society,” Geary said. “It is 
high-time we stop celebrating the 
Moynihan report.”

Alemu discussed his own work 

on understanding the effects of 
absent fathers in the Black com-
munity. He said since the Moyni-
han report was published in 1965, 
the number of families without a 
father has tripled.

Though in the report Moyni-

han suggests the solution to racial 
inequality is to put more Black 
men to work, Alemu found no 
links between employment and 
fatherhood.

“No man I’ve spoken to so far 

suggests that, ‘If only my father 
had been employed, he would 
have been present,’ or suggests 
that they can specifically cite his 
unemployment for absence as a 
father.”

Geary emphasized that while 

the report contains flaws, it 
should not be dismissed. The 
report prompted a conversa-
tion about how Black family life 
relates to social inequality, yet 
became derailed when political 
commentators focused on family 
while putting less emphasis on 
larger issues.

“Of 
course, 
people 
should 

research African American fami-
lies,” Geary said. “Families are 
related in a complicated way to 
economic and social inequality, 
but if we are only talking about 
families and we aren’t talking 
about other important things like 
taxes, employment, those are the 
places to start.”

with patients.

However, Medicare deter-

mines 
reimbursement 
for-

mulas based on a specialties 
— such as surgery or inter-
nal medicine — instead of 
how doctors actually spend 
their time. The study found 
that 
face-to-face 
meetings 

between 
neurologists 
and 

their patients are not compen-
sated as much as they are for 
other types of physicians.

“I think that as a pay-

ment system, (Medicare is) 
designed now so that face-
to-face services are generally 
not reimbursed as much as 
doing procedures,” she said. 
“As neurologists, many of our 
services are not amenable to 
treatment by procedure, but 
are highly valued in these 
encounters. So we think that 

should be thought more care-
fully about. What’s the value? 
We’re certainly not doing pro-
cedures for many of our neu-
rologic patients.”

Kerber said the study pro-

vided information about the 
makeup of the neurological 
workforce. He said this data 
could serve as a tool to deter-
mine how neurologists are 
paid and incentivized in rela-
tion to the way they practice 
medicine.

“Prior to the study, there 

was very little information 
available to actually under-
stand neurology practice in 
the United States in terms of 
payments and types of ser-
vices rendered,” he said. “We 
had a unique opportunity to 
look at that given the public 
release of the Medicare data 
regarding all physicians paid 
by Medicare.”

Skolarus said health care 

policies should value the ser-

vices different types of doc-
tors provide, and that she 
hopes this study can provide 
data to show that the services 
neurologists provide are more 
often base din evaluation and 
management.

“There’s a Medicare bonus 

and a Medicaid bump for 
certain specialties to receive 
extra payment for face-to-
face time, and neurology was 
not one of those specialties,” 
Skolarus said. “We hoped 
that this would provide a data 
point for both neurologists 
and policy-makers to show 
that neurologists look more 
like primary care specialties 
than they look like surgical 
specialties.”

In addition to the complexi-

ties associated with neuro-
logical diseases, Skolarus said 
medical treatments for neuro-
logical patients are often fine-
ly tuned and adjusted during 
face-to-face visits.

Kerber and Skolarus both 

said complex diseases like 
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s 
often require an increased 
level of attention from the 
doctor. Because face-to-face 
interactions are important, 
they should be properly com-
pensated by Medicare. The 
researchers said this is a pri-
mary reason why it’s impor-
tant to look at Medicare policy 
in the context of how doctors 
spend their time.

“I think that the goal of our 

study and what we’re finding 
is that we think as healthcare 
reform comes about, that the 
value of what different spe-
cialties do should be care-
fully determined,” Skolarus 
said. “There’s certainly value 
in 
both 
doing 
procedures 

and doing more face-to-face 
patient contact. Those should 
be 
determined 
for 
what 

they’re worth and not in such 
black and white.”

the Ku Klux Klan, especially in 
the South. He said Robert Byrd, a 
former U.S. senator, enrolled 150 
recruits in a chapter of the KKK 
in West Virginia, yet still served 
in the Senate as a Democrat until 
his death in 2010. Byrd later called 
his involvement in the KKK a “sad 
mistake.”

“Do you honestly think a Repub-

lican with the KKK on his resume 
would have had this much slack cut 
for him?” Murdock said.

Murdock said, as a Republican, 

he blames large government and 
over-regulation for laws such as 
segregation and other laws that 
marginalized 
Black 
Americans 

throughout history.

“For those of us that talk about 

the dangers of big government, Jim 
Crow was an example of big gov-
ernment activism,” Murdock said.

During the question and answer 

section of the lecture, LSA senior 
Michael Chrzan expressed his 
skepticism with some of the things 
Murdock discussed. For example, 
in the beginning of the talk, Mur-
dock referred to Martin Luther 
King Jr. as a Republican.

“I was just wondering what sup-

port you had for your claim that 
Martin Luther King was a Repub-
lican when in a 1958 interview he 
was quoted saying, ‘I don’t think 
that the Republican Party is a party 
full of the almighty God nor is the 
Democratic Party, they both have 
weaknesses and I’m not inextrica-
bly bound to either party,’” Chrzan 
said.

Murdock said his research has 

found Martin Luther King Jr. to be 
a member of the Republican Party, 
at least for a portion of time.

“My understanding was that he 

was a Republican early on and then 
switched in support of Democrats 
in 1964 after the Civil Rights Act 
was passed by LBJ,” Murdock said.

Chrzan said he thought the lec-

ture discussed interesting points, 
but he still found the discussion a 
one-sided point of view.

“I think if you’re going to talk 

about someone as historical as 
MLK you would know that MLK 
himself didn’t qualify himself as 
a member of your party,” Chrzan 
said.

Murdock said he found these 

talks to be a productive exercise, 
especially for furthering discus-
sion on campus.

“I thought the audience was 

very attentive, they asked very 
intelligent and often challenging 
questions,” Murdock said. “I would 
not describe anything as discourte-
ous or impolite, I know other con-
servatives that have appeared on 
campuses have been shouted down 
or their presentations have been 
disrupted.”

is done by other who are farther 
along in the process,” he said.

After council adopted the 

Housing 
Affordability 
and 

Equity Analysis in February, 
Councilmember Jane Lumm 
(I–Ward 
2) 
said 
accessory 

dwelling units have been iden-
tified as a priority and further 
work is taking place the con-
sider the option.

“When this was previously 

studied there was a significant 
effort on the part of the plan-
ning staff at the time,” Lumm 
said Monday. “There was also 
an accessory dwelling unit 
(committee) and I was part of 
that. There were significant rec-
ommendations made. There is a 
lot of work that has been done 
and a lot of this does not need to 
be reinvented.”

After public commentary 

ended, most of the attendants 
left the meeting.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christo-

pher Taylor (D) was not pres-
ent in the meeting. In Taylor’s 
absence, Councilmember Sabra 
Briere (D–Ward 1) presided 
over the meeting.

City Council approved the 

resolution that confirms the 
Nixon Road Sidewalk Special 
Assessment Roll. This resolu-
tion calls for the construction 
of a 5-foot sidewalk on Nixon 
Road. The estimated cost of the 
project is $14,537.

In response to Councilmem-

ber Jack Eaton’s (D–Ward 4) 
question if it is possible to install 
streetlights at the same time as 
sidewalk construction so as 
to avoid future construction, 
Craig Hupy, Ann Arbor pub-
lic services administrator, said 
streetlights are not included in 
the budget.

“Typically when we put 

streetlights in this time period, 
the way we do construction 
we don’t cut them in. We drill 
them and only where the bases 
are the lights themselves do we 
actually open up the ground, so 
the impact of putting them in is 
minimized,” Hupy said.

City Council also approved a 

resolution to create a skatepark 
advisory committee for Ann 
Arbor’s skatepark.

Though the originally pro-

posed resolution called for only 
seven members, Councilmem-
ber Eaton nominated an eighth 
member, Councilmember Ste-
phen Kunselman (D–Ward 3), 
and the additional appointment 

was approved by the council. 
Ultimately, the committee is 
slated to have nine members.

The committee consists of 

city employees, as well as two 
members of the Friends of Ann 
Arbor Skatepark organization.

This advisory committee is 

meant to provide advice and 
feedback to assist city staff in 
the maintenance and operation 
of the skatepark and to orga-
nize and promote events in the 
skatepark, among other respon-
sibilities.

Councilmember 
Mike 

Anglin (D–Ward 5), who spon-
sored the resolution, said this is 
one of the largest cooperative 
projects between the private 
sector and the city that he could 
remember.

“I am glad that people who 

are involved at the grassroots 
level here remain committed to 
this because it will need main-
tenance as time goes on and 
some other things. Everybody 
knows the popularity of this,” 
he said.

Committee members serve 

two-year terms.

City Council will reconvene 

Monday, April 13, to discuss the 
budget for the fiscal years of 
2016 and 2017.

porting various political causes, 
but this is his first time run-
ning for elected office.

“I am a proactive person 

who supports democratic val-
ues, progressive values, pro-
gressive infrastructure and 
environmental stewardship,” 
Magiera said.

Magiera has worked at the 

University in various capaci-
ties related to computer ser-
vices and programming for 
more than 10 years and also 
runs a business that offers 
digital 
and 
programming 

services. Magiera said these 
experiences will prove useful 
to bridging the gap between 
government and citizens.

“I feel that my experience 

with managing information 
will be a useful addition to 
City Council right now,” he 
said. “And I think that data 
is very important right now 
for understanding where our 
money goes, our tax money 
goes, understanding how ser-
vices 
work, 
understanding 

how well they work and things 
of that nature”.

Magiera said another rea-

son he is running is his belief 
that Eaton has not provided 
effective solutions to the city’s 
challenges during his time in 
office. Magiera said he con-
siders himself a “uniter” and 
someone who can offer viable 
solutions.

“He’s known for saying 

‘no’ to things, but he’s not 
known for providing alter-
nate solutions or suggesting 
ways through which things 
can move forward,” Magiera 
said. “And I think right now 
we need someone in that posi-

tion who is willing to suggest 
things that can move us for-
ward and provide some inspi-
ration.”

In response, Eaton said he 

has brought forward ideas and 
accepted compromises when 
he has been in disagreement 
with others rather than stand-
ing in opposition of proposed 
legislation.

Eaton’s 
main 
concerns 

include 
infrastructure 
and 

road repairs, and he suggested 
using a portion of the budget 
for to support such projects. 
Eaton also said the southern 
part of the 4th Ward faces 
flooding and sewage problems 
that need to be addressed.

Eaton said another problem 

in his ward is the high cost of 
living. Homeowners have dif-
ficulty staying in their houses 
due to the high property taxes 
that arise from rising property 
values.

“We want to make sure 

that people who are on a fixed 
income aren’t priced out of 
our city,” he said. “We want 
to make sure that we iden-
tify how to provide housing 
that is affordable for a person 
who works in the service sec-
tor that is notorious for low 
wages. And we want to make 
sure we can provide shelter for 
the chronically homeless.”

Magiera noted that afford-

able housing is related to other 
housing issues in the city. 
Construction of large housing 
structures has priced out peo-
ple making below the median 
income level.

“That needs to be addressed 

because there are economic 
and social implications of a 
city where only those who 
make above a medium-lev-
el income can afford to live 
there and can afford to shop 

there, can afford to eat at the 
restaurants, etc. We have to 
be careful to not isolate our 
community because that could 
have economic and cultural 
repercussions,” Magiera said.

He added that he wants to 

maintain the city’s parks and 
incorporate 
environmental 

and green technology into the 
community and foster art-
ists in Ann Arbor. He noted 
improvements in pedestrian 
safety and accessibility; bicy-
cle safety and infrastructure 
as key areas of focus.

Magiera said his candidacy 

is disadvantaged by Eaton’s 
incumbency. He said anoth-
er challenge he faces is that 
Eaton has tapped into the frus-
tration that people previously 
had with city government for 
his political advantage.

“I think that is kind of a dis-

advantage because he has that 
momentum going,” he said. 
“But I am hoping to override 
that momentum with positive 
energy and tapping into the 
possibility that government 
has to enrich our lives and to 
be honest and to be straight-
forward, not corrupt, not full 
of bureaucracy, efficient.”

When asked to comment 

on 
Magiera’s 
assessment, 

Eaton said that point does not 
deserve a response and that he 
will let the voters decide.

Magiera also said Eaton 

presents many situations as 
either downtown issues or 
neighborhood issues. Magiera 
said he finds this disingenu-
ous, as he believes that there 
is no divide between the resi-
dents and downtown area.

“Quite frankly, when I’ve 

asked people as I’ve been can-
vassing for the campaign, they 
generally say things that are 
ubiquitous throughout the city 

and that deal with the entire 
city and the downtown area 
infrastructure and stuff like 
that,” he said, adding that they 
want better infrastructure, 
mass transit and pedestrian 
safety, issues which are perti-
nent to the whole city.

Eaton said the situation is 

not as simple as Magiera pres-
ents it, but that he has placed 
a higher priority on the neigh-
borhoods than prior council 
members have.

“To the extent that taking 

care of basic services in the 
neighborhood costs the down-
town, I suppose I would place 
a higher priority in the neigh-
borhoods,” he said.

Eaton is in the process of 

collecting the necessary sig-
natures to gain a spot on the 
ballot, while Magiera said he 
has already collected the suf-
ficient number.

The Democratic Primary is 

scheduled for August 4. The 
general election is scheduled 
for Nov. 3.

Not only did 250 people sub-

I 

have spent this last semes-
ter sharing my experiences 
of being an out-of-state stu-

dent. 
But 
just 

how many of us 
 

are there?

This year was 

the first time in 
15 years that a 
majority of stu-
dents at the Uni-
versity were not 
from 
Michigan, 

but just barely. Of 
all the students 
enrolled in gradu-
ate or undergrad-
uate programs at the University, 
49.3 percent of students came from 
Michigan. The other 50.7 percent 
are a mixture of out-of-state and 
foreign students.

Almost six percent of students 

at the University are foreign stu-
dents from China. This is the high-
est represented region outside of 
Michigan. The most highly repre-
sented state in the United States 
is California, with 5.5 percent of 
students hailing from the Golden 
State. Another five percent are from 
New York, followed by Illinois and 
New Jersey as the next-most repre-
sented states.

So, there are tons of non-Mich-

iganders who call this place hoMe 
for eight months of the year, and that 
number has been steadily increasing 
for the past decade. From 2000 to 
2009, the number of in-state students 
held at around 56 percent. When the 
University switched to the Common 
Application in 2009, the number of 
out-of-staters jumped, causing the 
in-state population to drop to 53.9 
percent, and it has continued to 

decrease since.

I find value in having a large 

out-of-state population. I believe 
that having out-of-state students is 
important for any college campus. 
In my opinion, college is supposed to 
be about having new learning expe-
riences you could not have had in 
your hometown and being exposed 
to new and different people as well 
as new and different ideas. College 
is about breaking out of your bubble 
and meeting people from differ-
ent backgrounds in order to learn 
outside of a lecture hall. When I 
made my decision to come the Uni-
versity, this was a huge factor in 
 

that decision.

I wanted to live somewhere I had 

never experienced, and I wanted to 
interact with people who were dif-
ferent from the people I had spent 
the past 18 years with. I wanted to 
meet people from new places and, 
because of the out-of-state popu-
lation, I have. From Michigan to 
Georgia to Colorado to China, I 
have interacted with and been 
exposed to different lifestyles and 
ideas. 
Conversations 
with 
stu-

dents from different backgrounds 
have required me to tweak some 
of my own beliefs, but they have 
also made me more assured of 
 

other beliefs.

However, my reasons for appre-

ciating a large out-of-state popu-
lation may not be the same as the 
University’s. As state funding for 
many public schools started to 
decline in the 2000s, many schools 
have turned to high-tuition-paying 
out-of-state students to make up for 
this decline. A study showed that 
a 10-percent decrease in in-state 
monetary support correlated with 

a 2.7-percent increase in out-of-
state enrollment. At public research 
institutions like the University, the 
increase jumped to 4.6 percent.

As an out-of-state student, I don’t 

like the idea that I am being used for 
my higher tuition costs. It makes 
me question whether I would have 
been admitted to the University if 
I were an in-state student. Accord-
ing to the above data, my money 
is going to make up for the lack of 
state funding — going toward day-
to-day operations of the University 
that used to be funded by the state. 
I would hope that part of my higher 
costs is going toward financial aid. 
Giving the opportunity of educa-
tion, and hopefully the chance at 
a better life, to a student of lesser 
means is an extremely important 
feature of our higher educational 
system that I fully support. But the 
idea that my higher costs are being 
used for this purpose doesn’t seem 
to be the case.

A study here at the University 

showed that this increase in out-
of-state students is also associated 
with a decline in low-income or 
minority students who hypotheti-
cally would cost the University 
money in financial aid.

A diverse student body comes in 

many forms — not just from what 
state you came from, but also a per-
son’s socioeconomic background. 
I would hope that the University 
would be able to create a student 
body with both in order to give the 
most qualified students, regardless 
of paying ability, the best education 
and college experience.

Women have been fighting for 

equality for over a century, and 
yet feminism is still controversial. 
Women are still marginalized. Many 
countries, 
including 
the 
United 

States, have roots in monotheistic 
religions, which base their laws and 
ruling concepts on religious texts 
such as the Quran or the Bible. These 
texts were written at a time at which 
male-dominance over women was a 
cultural norm.

There really is no reason for this 

trend to still exist. We live in a world 
where the value placed on brawn 
has shifted to a value on brains. 
The extra muscle won’t affect your 
likeliness to survive anymore, nor 
should it affect your salary — pro-
fessional athletes and lumberjacks 
exempted. This shift to valuing our 
thoughts and social abilities over 
physical abilities should even the 
playing field for women. Women 
are equally capable of starting com-
panies, creating medical advance-
ments or running a country, but 
the amount of opportunities to 
do so, as well as the basic respect 
women receive, is significantly less 
than men. Whether subconsciously 
or consciously, women are being 
treated and taught that they are 
less than and therefore, should be 
subordinate to men. This thinking 
lets men think they are entitled to 
higher-ranking jobs, sex and power.

The disrespect and objectification 

women face day-to-day is excessively 
unequal to what men experience. 
(Mind you, I’m not saying men do 
not experience disrespect or objec-
tification, only that women experi-
ence this on a larger scale and more 
often.) Just last year, a man by the 

name of Elliot Rodger killed six 
people and wounded 13 others to 
seek revenge on women who had 
“starved (him) of sex.” The shoot-
ing reminded women what they had 
to fear for rejecting a man — a fear 
that most men have never expe-
rienced when rejecting a woman. 
Shortly following the shooting, the 
hashtag #YesAllWomen erupted on 
social media. Women all over the 
world were coming forward with 
their experiences of being hurt by 
male entitlement. It was a powerful 
movement and encouraged feminist 
awareness and debates as a part of 
social media culture.

I can rant about feminism and 

why I think women are treated 
unequally, but chances are those 
who already agree will be the ones 
raising their fists with me, and those 
who already disagree will roll their 
eyes and tune me out. Instead, I 
would like to suggest that we begin 
to think of the feminist cause in a 
realistic manner, to allow for some 
gray along with the black and white.

Many feminists wonder why they 

face so much resistance. It would be 
easy to chalk it all up to men not 
wanting to give up their power, or 
dismissing “feminists” as women 
who simply hate men. While these 
may be contributing factors, in my 
experience, the primary objection 
to feminism is that it tends to imply 
that women’s rights violations are 
more urgent than any other disre-
spect or human rights violation. 
Feminists can make it sound like 
disrespecting a woman is a larger 
crime than disrespecting any man 
or any other human, regardless of 
race, gender or sexual identity.

Another critique used against 

the feminist movement is the gen-
eralizations that occur so often. 
This is the primary reason why 
the #NotAllMen movement was so 
popular. It gave men the voice to say 
“I’m sorry you were disrespected by 
a man, but it wasn’t my fault so this 
isn’t my problem,” or “I did some-
thing nice for a woman once, so I’m 
not disrespectful to women.” But 
these generalizations that are so 
strongly criticized by anti-feminist 
movements are very difficult to 
avoid. Just because a generaliza-
tion has an exception, these excep-
tions do not eliminate the validity 
of the statement. Just because one 
man always asks for consent before 
having sex with a woman does not 
mean that all men do, and does not 
eliminate the fact that rape and 
sexual assault against women are 
far too common in our society.

As Nobel Peace Prize recipient 

Jody Williams said, “When we rec-
ognize equality, we are recognizing 
our common humanity.” Treating 
women as sexual objects is just 
that — treating them as objects or, 
in other words, not as humans. That 
should not be a cultural norm. Our 
daughters should not have to feel 
scared to be alone in a group of men; 
they should not have to apologize 
for voicing their opinions if dis-
agreeing with a man; they should 
not be paid less for the same abili-
ties and the same amount of work. 
These should also not be cultural 
norms. I’m not going to pretend that 
feminism is perfect, but feminism is 
important.

FROM THE DAILY

O

n March 26, House Bill 4014, which calls for tying state 
cash assistance benefits to student truancy rates, passed the 
state House of Representatives with a 74-36 vote. The bill 

simply legalizes what has already been practiced by the Department 
of Human Services since 2012, which The Michigan Daily’s 
Editorial Board criticized in an editorial in 2012. While admirable 
in its goal to decrease chronic truancy in Michigan public schools, 
the bill’s approach is misguided. This practice fails in four main 
ways: It punishes the entire family for the actions of just one of its 
members; it ignores many of the true causes of chronic truancy; it 
places too much responsibility on the shoulders of children; and it 
further hurts families who are already struggling financially, many 
of whom are minorities.

Cash assistance on welfare amounts to about 

$386 per month for the average family. Though 
removing cash assistance does correlate with 
decreased truancy rates in other states and also 
in Detroit Public Schools, it is a policy that’s 
flawed in principle. The bill blatantly ignores 
the myriad of reasons for chronic truancy. 
Aside from simply skipping school, students can 
be chronically truant because they don’t have 
adequate transportation to school, because 
of a medical condition or because they have 
to stay home and care for younger siblings. In 
other words, chronic truancy is sometimes the 
result of obstacles out of the control of children 
and parents, making it unfair to punish entire 
families for such obstacles.

Though it may be argued that the primary 

reason for chronic truancy is students simply 
choosing to skip school, if this is true, then 
it’s not wise to place an entire family’s cash 
assistance in the control of a student who 
chooses to do this. Furthermore, it could 
also be argued that the policy provides a 
financial incentive for families to discipline 
such rebellious youths. However, this doesn’t 
account for conditions parents could be 
facing, such as addiction and mental illness. 
If the family’s cash assistance is removed 
because of the actions of the truant child, 
these conditions can worsen. This policy also 
hurts families who are already struggling 
financially, potentially worsening problems 
— such as inadequate transportation — that 
caused truancy in the first place.

Statistics also show that many families on 

welfare are ethnic and racial minorities. By 
making these families’ financial problems 
worse, the mission of diversifying the state’s 

educated population could suffer with the 
passing of this legislation.

Not only is it evident that this bill 

oversimplifies the complicated nature of 
truancy, it also operates on shaky statistics. 
Governor Rick Snyder (R), a proponent of the 
bill, said in his January 2014 State of the State 
address, “If we don’t know what the truancy 
numbers are, how do you solve the problem, 
and we’re not doing our data appropriately in 
the state.” This suggests that the state doesn’t 
truly have enough information to synthesize 
legislation that attacks the roots of the problem.

Aside 
from 
these 
issues, 
the 
bill’s 

fundamental philosophy toward increasing 
attendance and incentivizing education is 
misplaced. Simple psychology shows that 
positive reinforcement is more effective 
in encouraging behaviors than negative 
punishments for not performing the desired 
behavior. Education should be incentivized 
with an emphasis on positive outcomes instead 
of an emphasis on fear of negative outcomes. 
Additionally, arguing for this bill on the basis 
that it provides a cash incentive for school 
attendance effectively places a financial value 
on education. This mentality undermines the 
true value of receiving an education, which 
extends far beyond the potential monetary 
gains it provides.

Though removing cash assistance from 

families who receive welfare benefits has 
been an effective punishment in that it has 
decreased truancy, it does not take into account 
the complexities of truancy and is unfounded 
in principle. Legislators need to gain a better 
understanding of this problem before passing 
laws that address it.

Just let me know you care

A 

strange phenomenon I’ve noticed 
when I tell people about my mental 
illness is that they instantly start 

telling me what to do about 
it. It usually starts with me 
saying, “Sorry I’ve been out 
of it lately — my depres-
sion’s been bad again,” and 
ends with them asking what 
medications I’ve been tak-
ing and telling me I ought 
to try yoga.

In my experience, this 

response is very specific 
to mental illness. When 
someone tells you they have 
diabetes, your initial reac-
tion isn’t, “Have you tried taking insulin?” 
Because chances are, if they have a diagno-
sis, they’re doing something about it, and the 
person telling them what to do is a medical 
professional.

So what is it about mental health that makes 

everybody think they’re an expert?

Nobody thinks that scraping their knee 

qualifies them to tell someone else how to cast 
a broken leg, but people seem to think that 
experiencing a range of human emotion quali-
fies them to give advice about mental illnesses. 
I think this has something to do with how we 
use certain terms colloquially. In normal con-
versation, “I’m so OCD” is a way to describe 
yourself as neat and organized. It’s acceptable 
to respond to disappointment by saying, “I’m 
so depressed,” and someone acting moody 
might be labeled “so bipolar.” As a result, it can 
be difficult to talk about mental illness because 
casual conversation is a place where its severity 

is drastically downplayed. (As a general rule, if 
you can add the word “so” in front of the men-
tal illness, it’s probably not being used in the 
 

appropriate context.)

When I say I’m depressed and someone 

tells me they’re also depressed because we lost 
the basketball game the other night, it’s hard 
to feel heard and understood. I’m not sure if 
it’s possible to truly understand how someone 
with a mental illness feels without personally 
having that illness. I do know, however, that 
it is possible to extend sympathy to someone 
who is hurting even if you don’t understand 
the depth of the hurt.

It’s important to keep in mind that the way 

to express sympathy isn’t by telling someone 
how he or she ought to cure his or her illness. 
The kind of inexpert medical advice I have per-
sonally received ranges from “you’ll improve 
with medications and therapy” to “just smile.” I 
don’t believe these people actually think they’re 
qualified psychologists. I think sometimes they 
just don’t know how else to respond. Although 
the social climate surrounding mental illness 
seems to be improving, it’s still clear that by 
telling people about my struggles, I’m opening 
a door that ought not to be opened. It makes 
people uncomfortable. The unspoken rule is 
that we don’t talk about our own mental illness-
es because the topic falls into a category that is 
private and extremely personal. Unfortunately, 
when we don’t talk about mental illness that 
often, other people don’t get much practice 
responding appropriately to open conversations 
 

about it.

I truly believe that people mean well when 

they give me unsolicited advice about how to 
handle my depression and anxiety. The people 

A poor fix to truancy

Tying class attendance to state benefits not a fair option

I trust enough to talk to are people 
who care about me. Even so, when 
someone tells me to go try getting 
more sleep or to go to yoga, it’s just 
reductive. I enjoy yoga as much as the 
next person, but when people suggest 
I try something extremely simple to 
fix a problem that weighs on me con-
stantly, it feels like they’re not taking 
me seriously. It feels more like they’re 
suggesting I downward dog my way 
out of a coma.

There is evidence supporting 

meditation and mindfulness as 

exercises for good mental hygiene, 
so the yoga thing is not technically 
bad advice. It’s just that when I want 
to talk about my mental health, I’m 
not seeking medical advice at all. 
I’m looking to talk to a friend about 
how I feel, because it’s the only way 
I know how to externalize what can 
be a very lonely experience. It’s a 
deeply personal struggle that can 
lead to important people in my life 
feeling shut out, and I’m actively 
working on letting people in.

So when I come to you to talk 

about my mental health, realize it’s 
because I trust you. I’m not ask-
ing you for the sound advice of a 
licensed clinician (I pay someone 
else a lot of money for that). It’s OK 
to feel awkward, and it’s OK to say 
the wrong thing. Just let me know 
that you care and that you really 
hear me.

And for the love of God, stop tell-

ing me to go to yoga.

La Dispute plays 
Masonic Temple 

Post-hardcore 

band plays intimate 
toned-down set at 

Detroit venue

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

It started with the tremble of 

a cabasa and some spoken word. 
Taking the quaint stage of the 
chapel in the Masonic Temple 
last Thursday night, La Dispute 
opened with a poem. The cha-
pel was silent as frontman Jor-
dan Dreyer recited the piece, his 
voice accompanied only by his 
own echo and the vibrating air of 
percussion. Ending with a quick 
breath and a “Thank you,” the 
crowd burst into cheers.

The atmosphere was inti-

mate, with an audience of little 
more than 300 people. A vaulted 
ceiling, velvet-cushioned pews 
and a hanging, illuminated cross 
made it obvious from the start 
that this would not be a normal 
concert experience. The show 
was broken up into three parts: 
a musical portion, followed by 
a question and answer session 
with the crowd and then more 
music from the band. Attract-
ing diehard fans, this type of 
show was perfect for those who 
wanted more than just a perfor-
mance. It was a conversation.

The group opened with “A 

Departure” off of Wildlife, setting 
the mood for the rest of the show. 
Playing mainly from their latest 
two albums, Wildlife and Rooms 
of the House, La Dispute kept it 
recent, despite their long history 
as a group. The setlist spanned 11 

songs, much of which paid hom-
age to Michigan, as the group is 
originally from Grand Valley.

These Michigan roots came 

out again in the question and 
answer, as a large portion of the 
crowd consisted of Grand Rapids 
natives, or close to it. Drawing 
inspiration from the company 
they found around them in GR, 
the band talked about how it has 
been able to grow, both musi-
cally and through the addition 
of new members, over its 11-year 
run. They told stories of playing 
in abandoned homes and having 
to sing into the left ear of a head-
phone set due to faulty micro-
phones – the sort of things fans 
eat right up.

Though La Dispute was not 

entirely at ease with this kind of 
back-and-forth with the audi-
ence, it was clear that the musi-
cians were trying to make it 
work. Dreyer openly admitted to 
the “sheer terror” he felt while 
performing, but he also felt that 
the admission of his unease was 
healthy and honest. At the open-
ing, he even apologized for the 
slight shake in his voice, as this 
type of show took a lot of cour-
age for him and his band mates. 
While singing, Dreyer remained 
seated, eyes closed, rocking 
back and forth atop a pleather-
upholstered chair. His delivery, 
as well as the instrumentals, 
was less aggressive than the 
group’s studio sound, adding to 
the intimacy.

The Q&A also brought out 

the quirks of the band members: 
They unanimously hate play-
ing “Such Small Hands” (even 
though many think it their claim 
to fame), a guitar riff on “Scenes 
From Highways 1981-2009” was 

stolen from a bird chirping outside 
the window of the band’s cottage, 
their music has been influenced by 
Stanley Kubrick movies. Dreyer 
even asked for an update on the 
Red Wings game from time to 
time. It was a refreshing change 
of pace to see a band that is usu-
ally dripping in sweat in front 
of a crowd of thrashing bodies 
replaced by one engaged in casual 
banter with its audience.

La 
Dispute’s 
toned-down 

musical performance was the 
perfect compliment to the con-
versation. Still harnessing their 
emotional 
prowess, 
Dreyer’s 

vocals were slightly less strained 
than his usual shouting delivery 
(think slam poetry). The instru-
mentals also took a step back, 
somehow managing to be soft 
yet still maintain their post-
hardcore sound. There was no 
one peak song or breakaway 
moment of the performance; 
it was largely about how each 
individual 
audience 
member 

related to different pieces. Look-
ing around, the connection was 
obvious – whether it was head 
bobbing, mouthing of words or 
just a subtle tap of the foot.

The 
show 
wrapped 
with 

“Objects In Space,” another 
breathy, 
heavily 
appreciative 

“Thank you” and the band’s exit. 
The emotional aftermath was 
one of appreciation – for the 
band, for their work, for the arts 
in general. This type of open and 
authentic presentation of their 
music, and of themselves, was 
so successful for La Dispute 
because they have never had 
anything to hide. Emotionally 
and mentally, they have always 
been willing to sharing it all – 
and that is exactly what they did.

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

Urban Outfitters 
killed the hipster

T

hrough every modern era 
of the last half-century, 
given strong political 

movements, faster spread 
of information and increas-
ingly educated 
populations, 
there’s a 
creeping 
underbelly of 
counterculture 
that thrives on 
the antithesis 
of what the 
prominent 
generation 
stands for. 
There were the hippies of the 
late 1960s, advocating free love 
and psychedelic drugs against 
the backdrop of the Nixon era 
and the Vietnam war, followed 
by the anti-establishment punks 
of the ’80s and ’90s.

A few years ago, a new kind 

of counterculture emerged: the 
hipsters, all at once disinterested 
in anything popular and becom-
ing increasingly the same in 
terms of fashion and consumer 
choices. This was a culture 
defined by indie rock, beards 
and upper-middle class white 
folks moving to urban areas. 
They were made fun of because 
of their pretentiousness and 
passivity, but also because they 
didn’t really stand for anything 
politically substantial. And then 
… they were everywhere.

The hipsters couldn’t count on 

standing out in their oversized 
flannel and beanies anymore. In 
the span of just a couple years, 
alternative fashion had spread to 
your little sister in middle school, 
every celebrity targeted by paps 
and even uppity sorority girls. 
This is an effect I like to call the 
“Urban Outfitters complex.”

With the introduction of my 

self-fabricated phrase, it’s nec-
essary to expose my readers to 
a perhaps shocking, yet neces-

sary truth: Urban Outfitters is 
very, very bad. There’s no way to 
analyze their terrible business 
practices as in depth as I would 
like to in this column. I could go 
on for thousands of words about 
the subject, but I’ll try and lay out 
a basic framework.

Widespread marketing of “hip-

ster” trends has diluted any sem-
blance of a politically substantial 
counterculture for this current 
era by exploiting people buying 
their way into trends. Why buy 
a vintage-looking Cosby sweater 
for $10 at Salvation Army when 
you can get the same thing at a 
store with hip marketing for $80? 
It might be clean, but it’ll prob-
ably fall apart in three washes 
like everything else in the store. 
(If you’ve ever bought a piece of 
clothing from Urban, you know 
that quality is not their most 
prized attribute.)

In fact, Urban Outfitters has 

relied on it’s cool-kid branding 
to sell absolute crap to people, 
who will buy nearly everything 
this chain puts out. Shot glasses 
shaped like prescription pill 
containers? Check. Clothing 
reminiscent of the Holocaust 
and pro-Nazi tendencies? Well, 
this is something. Oh geez, here 
too. Don’t have enough pressure 
on you to conform to unrealis-
tic body standards? Wear it on 
a T-shirt. Jesus Christ, how is 
this store still open? Well, my 
dear readers, it’s because Urban 
Outfitters is a store for “rebel-
lious teenagers” (read: rich kids 
spending their parents money on 
offending content), and so their 
innumerable controversies hit 
blind eyes.

“I mean yeah, Nazis are bad, 

but how cool are these HUF 
socks?”

So yes, Urban has a controver-

sial past in terms of content. But 
what about business practices? 
Urban Outfitters has a history of 

ripping off independent artists, 
taking advantage of jewelers and 
designers who are just trying 
to make a living for themselves. 
For a company that has become 
the Blessed Virgin for throngs 
of indie kids, I don’t see “ruin-
ing lives for capitalist profits” 
under the fine print of the laws of 
hipster-dom.

Whether for good or bad, 

hipster culture had the chance 
to become one of the next big 
social-political countercultures 
of modern day. In an alternate 
universe, a future Wikipedia 
article could accredit hipsters 
with leading the crusade for 
marriage equality or self-
sustaining farming or another 
valuable social movement. But 
the truth is, hipsters never had a 
chance. As soon as corporations 
realized they could exploit the 
trend of shrugging off popular 
brands for individuality and 
thrift stores, they provided a 
space for young people to pay 
their way into adopting the cool 
style of their older siblings and 
Tumblr models. And they made 
it very, very expensive.

With marketability, the cul-

ture became perverted and lost 
any chance of political credibil-
ity. This isn’t a tirade against 
our system of capitalism, but it 
is a commentary about ethical 
consumption under it. If you 
really want to be different and 
stand for something, invest 
your money in businesses with 
ties to sustainable practices — 
ones that support artists and 
designers in the career paths 
they’ve dedicated themselves to 
and don’t exploit mental illness 
and disaster for shock value 
profits. Urban is not countercul-
ture; it’s unethical.

FILM REVIEW
‘Gold’ fails to shine

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

Half courtroom drama, half 

historic snapshot, “The Woman 
in Gold” overestimates its central 
story’s intrigue 
and peppers in 
its most pow-
erful, redeem-
ing 
moments 

almost 
as 
an 

afterthought. 
After learning 
that the Austri-
an government 
is beginning an 
art reparations 
program for families to reclaim 
stolen art, Maria Altmann (Helen 
Mirren, “The Queen”) enlists the 
help of young, struggling lawyer 
Randol Schoenburg (Ryan Reyn-
olds, “The Proposal”) to help her 
retrieve a painting of her beloved 
Aunt Adele that was stolen from 
her family by the Nazis prior 
to WWII. However, while the 
painting is simply a portrait of 
her aunt to Maria, it is also one 
of Austria’s most prized posses-
sions, a masterpiece by Gustav 
Klimt, and it takes years of politi-
cal maneuvering to work the 
painting back into Maria’s pos-
session. As Altmann and Schoen-
burg weave their way through 
the legal roadblocks standing 
between them and the Austrian 
government, Maria is forced to 
face her harrowing past, bringing 
Randol to an understanding of 
his own ancestry in the process.

The film’s strength lies in its 

ability to seamlessly navigate 
between Maria’s past and pres-
ent. Skipping over the distant 
gazes, echoing words and hazy 
effects that seem to preclude 
most 
wartime 
flashbacks 
in 

film, “The Woman in Gold” eas-
ily moves into scenes of Maria’s 
memories in a way that feels com-
pletely believable, leaving the 
audience with a respect for Mir-
ren’s character that doesn’t seem 
formulaic or forced. The film at 
first eases into the flashbacks as 
Maria encounters herself as a 
child on the streets she grew up 
on, later fully immersing itself in 
her memories as she confronts 
the spaces that housed the most 
significant moments of her life 
in Vienna. The scenes of Maria’s 
opulent Vienna lifestyle, first 
encounters with the Nazi party 
and eventual escape to America 
add a fuel to a story that would 
otherwise easily deflate after 
the first few nervy courtroom 
scenes. The young Maria’s (Tati-
ana Maslany, “Orphan Black”) 
dynamic portrayal provides a 
perfect counterpart to Mirren’s 
tenacious older woman fighting 
to reconcile herself with the past.

The flashbacks float in a ghost-

ly, pale color palette that gives a 
cloyingly ominous tone to even 
Maria’s happiest memories, like 
dancing with her family on her 
wedding day. As we watch her 
picturesque life unravel around 
her, the chill of the images 
becomes more apparent, espe-
cially when placed against the 
warm shine of the gilded por-

trait of her aunt she is working to 
reclaim. We come to understand 
the painting as much more than 
just a piece of art; a symbol of the 
warmth that was leeched from 
her life by the Nazis, something 
that, even when it is reclaimed, 
can’t change the events of the 
past.

Ryan Reynolds, however, is 

a strange choice for the reluc-
tant lawyer who Maria enlists 
to handle her case, undermin-
ing the film’s solemn intentions 
and making a predictable shuffle 
through his emotional range. It’s 
difficult to take his schoolboy 
cuteness seriously given his past 
filmography, and while this does 
add an element of accessibility 
to a film that otherwise might 
appeal to a smaller, more seri-
ous crowd, it ultimately takes 
away from the film’s authentic-
ity. Moving from stressed to 
defeated to angry to elated with 
a disappointingly predictable 
rhythm, Reynolds attempts to 
hide the heart he wears on his 
sleeve while actually just dis-
guising it with a pair of cheap 
wire frames.

While 
the 
film’s 
focus 

seems to be misplaced on the 
long, asymmetric legal battle 
between a novice lawyer, his 
old family friend and the Aus-
trian government, its treat-
ment of memory and the past 
is able to breathe life into the 
slower side of the story, with 
one infamous portrait hang-
ing precariously in the chasm 
between then and now.

Important ‘Ground’

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

“She said, ‘I just want to make 

sure you don’t talk to anyone

As 
“The

onstrates 
in 

its 
opening 

scenes, a col-

can be a beau-
tiful

There’s noth-

e-mail that you’ve been accepted 
to your dream school. Once you 
arrive, there’s a general hustle 
and bustle that gives the attrac-
tive illusion of safety, of campus 
spirit and local culture inter-
mingling. Everything is happy 
and the world is your oyster.

Cut to the title card: “The 

Hunting Ground.” From that 
point forward, director Kirby 
Dick (“The Invisible War”) 
doesn’t waste any time on 
appearances. Pretty shots of 
springtime campuses are edited 
to be juxtaposed alongside the 
chilling testimonies of sexual 
assault victims on campuses all 
across the United States. That 
juxtaposition is a little on-the-
nose, as is Lady Gaga’s featured 
song “Till It Happens to You,” 
a song she wrote about sexual 
assault specifically for the film. 
Maybe it’s a little manipulative 
to use the soundtrack that way, 
and to start with that falsely 
cheery vision of college. It 
doesn’t really matter, though. 
This is all real. This needs to be 
seen.

As 
young 
women 
share 

their experiences, the camera 
racks focus on imaginary party 
scenes, coating the scene in lens 
flare and blurriness to suggest 
how little control the survivors 
had. In its best moments, “The 
Hunting Ground” attempts to 
remedy that helplessness and 
give agency to the survivors of 
sexual assault. The documenta-

ry focuses most often on Andrea 
Pino and Annie E. Clark, two 
survivors who banded together 
at the University of North Caro-
lina at Chapel Hill and sought to 
fix widespread ignorance about 
rape on college campuses. It’s 
deeply affecting to watch Pino 
and Clark working together 
and reaching out to survivors at 
other universities, whether it’s 
nervous Skype calls or emotion-
al meetings in person.

Woven in among the personal 

testimonies are statistics and 
interviews 
with 
profession-

als, to varying degrees of suc-
cess. Some moments are very 
effective, like a stylish, darkly 
funny montage of empty prom-
ises from college officials say-
ing they take reports of sexual 
assault “very seriously.” Other 
times, the numbers tend to dull 
down the impact of the subject. 
They’re important to hear, but 
hearing so many percentages 
depersonalizes sexual assault, 
reducing its ubiquity to a statis-
tic instead of a tragedy (as the 
famous saying goes). It’s also a 
little unnecessary to spend so 
much time with psychologists, 
journalists and campus officials 
who lend their opinions on the 
matter. Some of their interviews 
provide insight into the issue, 
especially when they explain 
universities’ financial incentives 
to withhold reports of sexual 
assault, but like the statistics, 
they create a certain distance 
from the heart of the issue. 
There’s also the simple fact 
that testimonials from campus 
administrators are inherently 
less interesting on an entertain-
ment level than interviews with 
the survivors themselves.

“The Hunting Ground” usu-

ally goes for breadth instead of 
depth, touching on many facets 
of sexual assault while leav-
ing many of them underdevel-
oped. This is both a strength 
and a weakness. On the positive 
side, “The Hunting Ground” 
gives viewers valuable knowl-
edge about a variety of issues 
and points of view related to 

assault, becoming the defini-
tive documentary about cam-
pus rape. On the other hand, 
some parts are interesting but 
don’t go anywhere. Around 20 
minutes focus on Greek life, 
particularly Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon, nicknamed “Sexual Assault 
Expected.” Some time is spent 
on Erica Kinsman, the alleged 
victim 
of 
FSU 
quarterback 

Jameis Winston. One scene fea-
tures a male student confessing 
how his claim is taken less seri-
ously due to his gender. These 
are all intriguing threads that 
warrant entire documentaries 
of their own, but some of them 
are barely touched on.

At one point, Notre Dame stu-

dent Molly, near tears, recounts 
the experience of telling her 
parents about her assault. Her 
father, a Notre Dame alum, 
constantly wears his class ring, 
but when Molly tells him about 
her assault, he never wears it 
again. It’s the kind of personal 
detail that transcends statistics 
and calculated psychological 
diagnoses. It’s poignant stories 
like this that make the film so 
important.

Despite some technical issues 

with structure and allocation of 
time, “The Hunting Ground” is 
an example of a movie in which 
content is more important than 
form. It demands viewing sim-
ply because of how essential 
the subject is, and how des-
perately sexual assault survi-
vors need someone out there to 
show them they’re not alone. 
The documentary is a visceral, 
important piece of cinema that 
pleads with its audience not to 
forget its messages. Most view-
ers won’t.

Lives are bleak in 
‘Shameless’ finale

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

A manic mother smiles, looks 

into her son’s uncertain eyes and 
says, “People like us, we can be 
happy.”

She’s 
not 

clear what kind 
of “people like 
us” she is refer-
ring to. Maybe 
she 
means 

people 
with 

bipolar 
disor-

der. Maybe she means South Side, 
working class people. Maybe she 
means queer people — mother is 
bisexual and son has a devoted 
boyfriend who is worried sick and 
calling every three seconds. Mon-
ica Gallagher (Chloe Webb, “Sid 
and Nancy”) probably intended for 
those words to evoke a combina-
tion of meanings. That look into 

her son’s eyes is an attempt to prove 
that she understands who he is and 
where he’s coming from, but also 
a plea for him to stay by her side 
so they can search for happiness 
together.

In the fifth season finale of 

“Shameless,” 
every 
character 

desperately grabs for happiness, 
with some finding more success 
than others. Of all the Gallagh-
ers that would merit sunshine and 
smiles, star-crossed lovers Ian 
(Cameron Monaghan, “Gotham”) 
and Mickey (Noel Fisher, “Teen-
age Mutant Ninja Turtles”) need 
a break the most. Ian’s struggle 
with bipolar disorder has taken a 
huge toll on Mickey, who’s trying to 
push through the waves of frenetic 
mania and anger and be Ian’s sup-
port system. Monaghan and Fisher, 
who have always been among the 
strongest of “Shameless” ’s ensem-
ble, stepped up even further and 
packed the “Gallavitch” scenes with 
even stronger emotional punches. 
But Ian finally decides he can’t let 
Mickey wait around to try and fix 
him. “Too much is wrong with me!” 
he cries, and the camera cuts back 
to Mickey, who is standing dumb-
struck like Ian just reached into his 
chest and squashed his heart with 
both hands. They’re broken up, but 
something tells me that Mickey 
will keep waiting until Ian’s ready 
to love him again.

Eldest son Lip Gallagher (Jeremy 

Allen White, “Bad Turn Worse”) 
falls further into his entanglement 
with professor Helene (Sasha Alex-
ander, “Rizzoli and Isles”). He’s still 
a little fuzzy on the details of their 
relationship, especially with why 
she’s so interested in pursuing this 
relationship if she’s married and 
her husband knows about the affair. 
All season, Lip has been struggling 
to navigate his identities as a South 
Side kid and a college undergrad, a 
little too brainy and concerned to 
fit in as well with his hometown 
friends, but more impulsive and 
risky than the average RA. Helene 
is a sexual step toward the aca-
demic, a Benjamin Braddock-esque 
rung in the liminal period before 
adulthood and his choice of wheth-
er he wants to be a drug-dealing 
thug or a robotics genius. At the end 
of the episode, Lip confesses to Ian 
that he might be starting to develop 
feelings for Helene, yet another 
force pulling him to school and fur-
ther away from the South Side and 
his chaotic family.

Fiona (Emmy Rossum, “The 

Day After Tomorrow”), who is usu-
ally the glue keeping the Gallagh-
ers from falling apart at the seams, 
has descended into an increasingly 
messy personal life. Her impulsive 
marriage to musician Gus (Steve 
Kazee, “Working Class”) lacked a 
solid foundation, and his time away 
on tour only made him reflect on 
the sad state of their union. Fiona 
finally acted on her feelings for 
her boss Sean (Dermot Mulroney, 
“August: Osage County”), express-
ing her hopes that maybe they 
could ditch their misery and actual-
ly be happy together. He replies that 
“happy is overrated” and that Fiona 
needs to “grow up.” The two paral-
lel romances that Fiona has been 
following this season both end at a 
standstill. For Fiona, happiness and 
love are synonymous, and appar-
ently she’s got some growing up to 
do before she’s ready for either.

14-year-old Debbie (Emma Ken-

ney, “Epic”) seems to be heading 
down the same path as Fiona — 
making thoughtless decisions and 
taking on responsibilities before 
she’s mature enough to handle 
them. Debs is desperate for a stable 
and loving family, kind of like the 

one her boyfriend has. She thinks 
the only way to get a real family is to 
go off the pill and try and start her 
own. Fiona tries to convince Debs 
that she’s not thinking her decisions 
through, and could “ruin her life” 
by signing up to build a family with 
a guy she barely knows. When Debs 
reminds Fiona that her marriage 
to Gus was essentially the same 
situation, Fiona realizes that no 
matter what she says, Debbie is 
going to make her own decisions 
and her own mistakes. Debs ends 
the episode by smiling at the 
results of her pregnancy test — 
for Debbie’s sake, I truly hope it’s 
negative. Her boyfriend seems 
only tentatively committed, tak-
ing his time to say “I love you” 
and not committing to spending 
the night.

All these storylines reach a 

thrilling rush in the finale, but 
several others are less com-
pelling and riddled with nar-
rative 
problems. 
Gallagher 

patriarch Frank (William H. 
Macy, “Fargo”) has always been 
one of the weakest links of the 
show, an unsympathetic and 
pathological drunk who’s impos-
sible to root for and whose tricks 
are more annoying than funny. 
His relationship with dying 
doctor Bianca (Bojana Nova-
kovic, “Rake”) was the closest 
to paternal he has ever been. 
Bianca brought out refreshing 
shades of Frank’s personality 
(and Macy’s performance) that 
were heretofore unseen. Appar-
ently, Frank is capable of caring 
for someone other than himself. 
Their symbiotic friendship was 
one of the best parts of the sea-
son, and I’d have liked seeing the 
two share more scenes together. 
Bianca’s ending her own life felt 
unnecessary, like there was still 
more story left to tell and that 
wouldn’t have happened if this 
weren’t a finale that was sup-
posed to have some dramatic 
turn of events.

Ah, finale fireworks. If a need-

less character death weren’t 
enough, 
“Shameless” 
also 

brought the actual antichrist 
back for a final shootout. Sammi 
(Emily Bergl, “Desperate House-
wives”) is the most despicable 
character to ever appear on this 
show full of despicable char-
acters: She sent Ian to military 
prison, shot her father in the 
arm, tattooed a swastika on her 
son’s forehead to help him sur-
vive in juvie — the list of her 
deplorable actions could go on 
forever. Bergl is a fine actress, 
but her character seems to be 
around just as a catalyst to set the 
Gallaghers on edge. As she runs 
around the yard shooting aim-
lessly and hollering and chasing 
Mickey, I can’t help but lament 
the fact that Mickey’s plan to kill 
her didn’t end successfully.

“Shameless” is the kind of 

show that’s steeped in chaos and 
unhappiness. Dysfunction, drugs, 
mental illness, tumultuous rela-
tionships and neglect seem to 
run in the Gallagher blood. As 
“Shameless” embraces its tragic 
elements more and more with 
each year, it’s fitting that this 
season ends on so many ambiva-
lent notes. If Monica Gallagher 
wonders if “people like us” can 
be happy, this “Shameless” fina-
le does not provide an answer. 
Some characters look to be head-
ing down the road to stability or 
growing up or legitimate change, 
but knowing “Shameless,” this 
will probably descend to more 
chaos and complication in the 
seasons to come.

FILM REVIEW
‘Furious’ lives on

Action sequel pays 
tribute to late Paul 
Walker ... and blows 

shit up

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Seniro Arts Editor

Here’s the deal: You already 

know if you want to see “Furious 
7.” If you’re reading this review 
and 
you’re 

thinking, “Gee, 
I’m really split 
on the fast car 
explosions 
movie, 
maybe 

this review can 
help me,” do not 
go. Just don’t 
even 
bother. 

Because what you’re going to get 
is a standard action-revenge flick, 
jacked up on steroids — all of the 
steroids. It’s got so much audacity 
and American shoot-em-up pride 
that it whisks away its characters 
to Abu Dhabi so they can steal an 
unnamed Middle Eastern prince’s 
monster of a vehicle by jumping 
it across the sun-kissed sky into 
three skyscrapers from the ump-
teenth floor. That is the kind of 
movie you’re getting.

And what, say you, could com-

pel our heroes to commit such 
acts of daring? The sins of the 
past, come back to haunt. After 
Dom (Vin Diesel, “Guardians of 
the Galaxy”) and his crew beat 
down on baddie Owen Shaw in 
the previous “Fast” film, Shaw’s 
brother Deckard (Jason Statham, 
“Homefront”) seeks vengeance 
by hunting down the remaining 
members of the crew. In response 
to Shaw’s vengeance, Dom swears 

vengeance of his own, but to find 
Shaw he needs to first steal the 
God’s Eye, a super powered track-
ing device that I imagine is the 
stuff of Dick Cheney’s bedroom 
fantasies, for the government.

But the plot doesn’t matter, 

nor is it particularly cohesive. 
Because its plot is so full of holes 
(from both a writing standpoint 
and an “adherence to the laws of 
physics” standpoint), “7” requires, 
more than most films, that you 
suspend your disbelief. It knows 
exactly what it wants to be, and it 
doesn’t want you dropping logic 
and negativity on it.

“Furious 7,” like all of the 

films in the franchise, isn’t about 
“making sense.” In fact, it spits 
on “making sense.” It’s the ulti-
mate expression in movie escap-
ism — big, bold, self-aware. It is 
so self-aware that it takes time to 
explicitly name each character’s 
stereotype, from Dom’s alpha 
male to Roman’s (Tyrese Gib-
son, “Transformers”) jokester. 
It wears its big, juiced-up Hemi 
of a heart on its sleeve, and it’s 
damn proud of it.

And for good reason, because 

“Furious 7” might be the most 
fun you have at the movies this 
year. It exists in a world all on 
its own, a world where, when 
it’s cars versus, say, a predator 
drone, it’s a pretty fair fight; a 
world where The Rock (“Hercu-
les”) flexes out of the cast on his 
broken arm and walks out of the 
hospital to go look for a chain 
gun. “7” ultimately amounts to 
a series of action set pieces, each 
more outrageous than the last, 
and it revels in its excess.

Director James Wan (“The 

Conjuring”), taking over for 
four-time “Fast” director Justin 
Lin, stages those sets effectively, 

using a steadicam so the audience 
can actually follow the action 
without feeling dizzy. There’s 
nothing complex — some slo-mo 
here, some fast-mo there — so as 
to let the action speak for itself.

But for as much as it’s about 

action, it’s also about fam-
ily. Seven films in, these actors 
don’t so much as act as they do 
pal around. There’s a unique 
chemistry here that gives the 
film an uncanny amount of 
life, more life than anything 
with “7” in its title deserves. Of 
course, it comes under unfortu-
nate circumstances.

For as much as we see Brian 

O’Conner, the man who plays 
him isn’t there much at all. Paul 
Walker 
(“Hours”) 
tragically 

died in November 2013 before 
any of the film’s action sequenc-
es were shot. Using sly camera-
work (framing Walker’s scenes 
at a distance in usually dark 
settings) and some unparalleled 
digital wizardry, the filmmak-
ers bring Walker back to life, his 
face smiling, his eyes animated 
and shining. “Furious 7” is his 
coda, one last supercharged 
orchestration of machismo and 
heart and bravery; the last five 
minutes are perfect and, dare I 
say, beautiful.

That’s probably why “Furi-

ous 7” turned out the way it did 
— it needed to pack enough life 
into itself to raise one of its own 
from the dead. And it works.

That’s the power of movies, 

even the popcorn trash. For two 
hours, you give yourself to that 
silver screen; sometimes you get 
entertainment, sometimes you 
get rubbish, others still you’ll 
get thinkpieces. With “Furious 
7,” you get energy, vivacity — 
life.

Government leaders 
uncensor Youtube 
and Twitter after 

hostage crisis

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey 

blocked access to social network-
ing sites Twitter and YouTube 
for several hours on Monday over 
photos showing a militant point-
ing a gun at a prosecutor who died 
last week in a failed hostage rescue 
operation. Turkey also threatened 
to ban Google over the images.

A spokesman for President 

Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a 
Turkish prosecutor had ordered 
Internet providers to block the 
sites. The request stemmed from 
postings of photos that showed 
militant Marxists pointing a gun 
at the prosecutor, Mehmet Selim 
Kiraz, who died in a shootout 
between police and the Marxists 
who were holding him hostage.

Government 
officials 
have 

blasted Turkish media for post-
ing the images, which they have 
called anti-government propa-
ganda. Kiraz, was shot in the head 
during the standoff and died in a 
hospital soon after.

The state-run Anadolu Agency 

said access was blocked because 
Twitter 
and 
YouTube 
didn’t 

remove images of the prosecutor 
despite an official notification. It 
said the Internet Providers noti-
fied Twitter and YouTube, but 
video, photographs and audio 
continued to be posted on these 
sites. The Turkish telecommuni-
cations authority wouldn’t imme-
diately comment.

A government official said 

Turkey decided to lift the ban on 
Twitter in the late afternoon after 
the company agreed to remove all 
images of the prosecutor and tele-
coms authorities verified that it 

had done so. The official spoke on 
condition of anonymity because 
she was not authorized to speak 
publicly on the issue.

Anadolu said access to You-

Tube was restored in the evening 
after it agreed to abide by the 
Turkish court order.

Turkey however, then threat-

ened to ban Google unless it 
removed search results showing 
the slain prosecutor’s images.

Earlier, Twitter said it was 

working to restore access to users 
in Turkey.

The journalists group, Turkish 

Press Council, said that while it 
understood the authorities con-
cerns over the publication of the 
prosecutors’ photographs, it said 
banning social media websites 
was in conflict with democracy.

“It is meaningless to totally shut 

down social platforms — which 
contain billions of useful informa-
tion — to the use of the Turkish 
people because of some unsuitable 
content,” the group said.

Users meanwhile were sharing 

information on how to get around 
the ban on the Internet.

Last year, Turkey blocked 

access to YouTube and Twitter 
after audio recordings of a secret 
security meeting or tapes sug-
gesting corruption by government 
officials were leaked on the social 
media sites. Turkey’s highest 
court, however, overturned the 
bans, deeming them to be uncon-
stitutional.

Previous moves by Turkish 

authorities to block the social 
media networks have provoked 
widespread criticism by Western 
governments and human rights 
organizations.

Many tech-savvy users, includ-

ing former President Abdullah 
Gul, had found ways to circum-
vent the bans both on Twitter 
and YouTube while they were in 
place.

advisers expecting babies

Senior executive staff 
will be first to serve 
while pregnant as 
assistant to Obama

WASHINGTON (AP) — Jen 

Psaki thought the offer to be 
President Barack Obama’s com-
munications director wouldn’t 
last long.

She figured White House chief 

of staff Denis McDonough hadn’t 
heard she’s expecting a baby girl 
in July. “My immediate instinct 
in my head was to tell him I’m 
pregnant and this will be the end 
of this. He’ll tell me good luck 
and be very kind about it and I’ll 
be on my merry way,” said Psaki, 
who was serving as chief spokes-
woman at the State Department.

Instead McDonough — and 

later Obama himself — assured 
Psaki they would accommodate 
her needs as a new mom amid the 
West Wing’s nonstop demands. 
She started in the post Wednes-
day and is one of two pregnant 
women serving as assistant to the 
president — a first for such a top 
level adviser in Obama’s presi-
dency and practically unheard of 
under previous presidents.

Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s first 

chief of staff and now Chicago 
mayor, once remarked that every 
White House says they’ll be fam-
ily-friendly, but it’s never really 
a good workplace for any family 
except the president’s.

Yet Obama has pushed family-

friendly policies like childcare, 
flexibility and paid leave, includ-
ing instituting 12 weeks paid 
maternity leave for his own staff. 
But until now, he hasn’t put it into 
practice in a very prominent way 
with few mothers of young chil-
dren on his own senior team.

“All workplaces are adapt-

ing and that includes the White 
House,” said Obama legislative 
director Katie Beirne Fallon. She 
is scheduled to give birth to iden-
tical twin boys in May, just as her 
husband, Brian, plans to start as 
press secretary for Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton’s impending presi-
dential campaign in New York.

Fallon said she made it clear 

when she took her job that they 
were trying to start a family. She 
said everyone has been accom-
modating — from cooks at the 
mess hall where her lunch orders 
have included a baked potato 
topped with tuna fish and frozen 
yogurt with Raisin Bran, all the 

way up to the president.

“He’s constantly checking in 

on me,” she said, urging her not to 
miss doctor’s appointments and 
to put her health first. “Don’t let 
us get in the way of that,” she said 
he’s told her. Fallon and Psaki 
both say they envision working 
more flexible hours so they can 
put their babies to bed.

Press secretary Josh Earnest 

— one of several new fathers in 
the West Wing — says he tries 
to get home once a week before 
his baby is asleep. Obama tries 
to make it to dinner every night 
with his wife and daughters.

“I don’t think it would be 

appropriate for me to be home at 
6:30 every night in the way that 
he is,” Earnest said at a Center for 
American Progress forum. But 
he said Obama’s actions signal to 
staff they can make family a pri-
ority.

Times have changed. Joan 

Baggett Calambokidis, President 
Bill Clinton’s political director, is 
one of the only other assistants to 
the president that former White 
House aides can remember hav-
ing a baby on the job. She spent 
her delivery taking calls from the 
West Wing to discuss the choice 
of a new party chair. 

Magazine vows to 
further investigate 

its reporting 

CHARLOTTESVILLE, 
Va. 

(AP) — A fraternity at the Uni-
versity of Virginia announced 
Monday that it will “pursue all 
available legal action” against 
Rolling Stone, saying a Colum-
bia Journalism School review 
shows the magazine acted reck-
lessly and defamed its members 
by publishing an article that 
falsely accused them of gang 
rape.

“The Rolling Stone article 

viewed by millions fueled a 
court of public opinion that 
ostracized Phi Kappa Psi mem-
bers and led to vandalism of the 
fraternity house,” the fraterni-
ty’s statement said.

“Clearly our fraternity and its 

members have been defamed, 
but more importantly we fear 
this entire episode may prompt 
some victims to remain in the 
shadows, fearful to confront 
their attackers,” said Stephen 
Scipione, president of the the 
University of Virginia’s Phi 
Kappa Psi chapter. “If Rolling 
Stone wants to play a real role 
in addressing this problem, it’s 
time to get serious.”

Rolling Stone’s “shock narra-

tive” about sex assaults at the 
University of Virginia was rife 
with bad journalism, and the 
magazine has nobody but its 
own staff to blame, Columbia 
Journalism School Dean Steve 
Coll said Monday at a question 
and answer session about the 
review he led at the magazine’s 
request.

The 
magazine 
pledged 

to review its practices and 
removed “A Rape on Campus” 

from its website, but publisher 
Jann S. Wenner said he won’t 
fire anyone despite the blister-
ing review. In a New York Times 
interview, Wenner described 
“Jackie,” whose claims provided 
the article’s narrative thread, 
as “a really expert fabulist sto-
ryteller” who manipulated the 
magazine’s journalism process.

“Rolling 
Stone 
Magazine 

admits its staff engaged in reck-
less behavior while covering this 
story, yet the magazine refuses 
to take any action against those 
involved in reporting the story 
or address needed changes to its 
editorial process. The reporter 
in question not only failed to 
apologize to members of Phi 
Kappa Psi, but doesn’t even 
acknowledge the three wit-
nesses she quoted in the article 
but never interviewed. This is a 
clear and sad indication that the 
magazine is not serious about 

its journalistic obligations,” the 
fraternity said.

Coll strongly disagreed “with 

any suggestion that this was 
Jackie’s fault.”

“The editors made judgments 

about attribution, fact-checking 
and verification that greatly 
increased their risks of error but 
had little or nothing to do with 
protecting Jackie’s position,” 
the report found.

Jackie’s lawyer, Palma Pustil-

nik, told The Associated Press 
on Monday that “we are not 
making any comment at all at 
this time.”

University President Teresa 

A. Sullivan said the article hurt 
efforts to fight sexual violence, 
tarred the school’s reputation, 
and falsely accused some stu-
dents “of heinous, criminal acts 
and falsely depicted others as 
indifferent to the suffering of 
their classmate.”

Rolling Wolverines 
host EMU Tuesday

By DANNY VARGOVICK

Daily Sports Writer

It isn’t a good time to run into 

the Michigan baseball team.

The Wolverines (4-5 Big Ten, 

18-13 
overall) 

have 
won 

their last two 
weekend series 
against Big Ten 
behemoths 
Maryland and 
Indiana 
and 

haven’t lost a 
midweek game 
all year.

Tuesday, 

Michigan 
will 
welcome 

neighboring 
Eastern 
Michigan (4-5 Mid-American 
Conference, 12-18 overall) to Ann 
Arbor for a 4 p.m. game. And even 
despite his team’s recent string 
of success, Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich said there’s no chance it 
will neglect to prepare for the 
Eagles.

“We’re not going to overlook 

tomorrow’s 
training 
session,” 

Bakich said. “Even though we’ve 
had a couple of nice weekends 
in a row, we still have to get 
better. We have an opportunity 
to compete. Our backs are still 
against the wall, and we’re going 
to come out fighting against 
Eastern for 27 outs.”

Junior left-hander Evan Hill 

will make his first start of the 
season after returning from 
injury. Hill was the Wolverines’ 
top starter a year ago, posting a 
3.24 earned-run average in 89 
innings.

He made his season debut 

last weekend against Indiana, 
pitching one inning, allowing one 
hit and striking out two.

Bakich said Hill’s return is 

a big boost to the club, not only 
from a talent perspective, but also 
from an emotional perspective.

“It’s just being able to have 

the positive contribution of a 
teammate who’s been in the 
trenches with everyone the entire 
time,” Bakich said. “Nobody 
wants to be sidelined with an 
injury. To get him healthy and 
back, it helps us to be firing on all 
cylinders.”

Third 
baseman 
Mitchell 

McGeein and right fielder Jordan 
Peterson pace Eastern Michigan 
offensively.

McGeein has collected eight 

home runs on the year, the top 
mark in the MAC. He has a 
.398 on-base percentage and is 
slugging .591. For comparison, 
sophomore right fielder Carmen 

Benedetti leads the Wolverines 
with a .527 slugging percentage.

Peterson has a .395 OBP, 

offering much less power but 
posting eight steals on the season.

The Eagles have not yet 

announced who will start on the 
mound.

The Wolverines and Eagles 

have had one common opponent 
so far this season — Indiana — 
which Michigan beat this past 
weekend. The Hoosiers swept 
Eastern Michigan in mid-March.

All signs point toward an 

advantage for the Wolverines. 
Bakich, 
however, 
won’t 

underestimate any team.

“Anybody can beat anybody on 

any given day in college baseball,” 
Bakich said. “We’re not going to 
take them lightly, and they’re not 
going to take us lightly.”

Harbaugh adds third 
commit in four days

Alabama RB, 
Indiana QB, 

Michigan LB join 

2016 class

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

More than three months have 

passed since Jim Harbaugh’s 
introduction 
as 
Michigan 

football coach.

But the excitement hasn’t 

worn off in recruiting.

Harbaugh 
added 
three 

recruits to his 2016 class in the 
past four days, sandwiched 
around the team’s Spring Game 
on Saturday.

The 
most 
recent 
was 

Kingston Davis, a three-star 
running 
back 
according 
to 

Scout.com, who tweeted his 
commitment Monday morning.

The 6-foot-1, 225-pound back 

from Prattville, Alabama was 
high-school teammates with 
2015 cornerback recruit Keith 
Washington. Davis also had 
offers from Louisville, Ole Miss, 
Mississippi 
State, 
Southern 

Mississippi and three Sun Belt 
schools.

Last season, Davis rushed 

for 1,432 yards on 192 carries, 
scoring 
14 
touchdowns 
as 

Prattville made a run to the 
state title game before falling. 
He added seven catches for 114 
yards and another score.

The first commitment of the 

weekend came from Brandon 
Peters via Twitter on Friday 
night. Peters is a 6-foot-4, 190-
pound quarterback from Avon, 
Indiana. 
Scout.com 
ranks 

him No. 1 among Midwest 
quarterbacks and No. 20 overall 
among quarterbacks in the class, 
but ESPN.com’s ranking is more 
favorable, listing him as the No. 
12 signal caller in the class.

Peters earned first-team All-

Conference and AP All-State 
honors last season as a junior, 
when he passed for 1,876 yards 
and 22 touchdowns. Michigan 
could have as many as five 
scholarship 
quarterbacks 
in 

2015 — junior Shane Morris, 
redshirt 
freshman 
Wilton 

Speight, freshman Zach Gentry, 
freshman Alex Malzone and 
graduate transfer Jake Rudock. 
Houston transfer John O’Korn 

will be eligible starting in 2016.

Committing 
shortly 
after 

Peters was David Reese, a 
6-foot-1, 235-pound native of 
nearby Farmington, Michigan. 
He will start his career as a 
fullback, though he also played 
linebacker 
in 
high 
school. 

Scout.com only ranks him as a 
middle linebacker, the best in 
the Midwest and the ninth-best 
overall.

Playing 
both 
ways 
for 

Farmington 
High 
School 

last season, Reese carried 42 
times for 297 yards and seven 
touchdowns 
and 
made 
107 

tackles (56 solo). He added a 
blocked kick as the Falcons 
went 7-3, won their league and 
made the playoffs.

Davis, Peters and Reese join 

two commitments in the 2016 
class from Brady Hoke’s tenure: 
three-star outside linebacker 
Dele’ Harding and four-star 
offensive tackle Erik Swenson. 
Harding, a 6-foot-1, 230-pound 
native of Elkton, Maryland, 
ranks 
56th 
among 
outside 

linebackers, 
while 
Swenson, 

a 6-foot-7, 285-pounder from 
Downers Grove, Illinois, is 12th 
in his position group.

Between conference series, 
‘M’ plays Eastern Michigan

Wolverines a heavy 
favorite over local 

foe EMU

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Eastern 
Michigan 

softball team isn’t in a power 
conference. It isn’t in the 
running for the NCAA title, and 
it’s far from the top 25.

But 

Tuesday, it will 
try to do what 
only 
Florida, 

Arizona State, 
Kent 
State, 

Iowa 
and 

Minnesota 
have 
been 

able to do this 
season — beat 
Michigan.

The 

Wolverines 
(7-2 Big Ten, 
33-6 
overall) 

will 
host 

their 
Washtenaw 
County 

neighbors in a break from 
Big Ten play. No. 4 Michigan 

returns to Alumni Field after 
taking two commanding wins 
in a three-game series against 
No. 19 Minnesota. Amid the 
conference 
schedule, 
the 

Wolverines’ next home series 
won’t arrive for a few more 
weeks, so getting the chance to 
play at home is a nice relief for 
the team and its fans.

“This is among a lot of road 

games,” said senior catcher 
Lauren Sweet. “So any time we 
can play at home, we are excited 
about it.”

Sweet, who was out for about 

two weeks due to an ankle 
injury, returned to form against 
Minnesota by 
recording 
a 

home run and 
six RBI. Her 
performance 
wasn’t 
perfect, 
but 

she 
showed 

signs that the 
injury was no 
longer a major 
factor.

“Even when 

my at-bats didn’t have the best 
result, I felt I was taking good 
swings,” Sweet said. “Behind 
the plate, I felt a lot better this 
weekend. I had another week to 
get my ankle a little better.”

Strong pitching performances 

from both right-hander Megan 
Betsa and left-hander Haylie 
Wagner also highlighted the 
weekend. With just two options 
in the circle, the team still 
awaits the return of senior 
right-hander Sara Driesenga.

Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins planned to give her 
players the day off Monday to 
ensure they had time to rest 
with only one day in between 
games.

“We take the day off, and 

we hope that it will help us 
continue to stay locked in 
during that game,” Hutchins 
said Sunday. “Right now, we just 
need to relax. Minnesota was a 
very intense series, and they 
deserve a day off. We are going 

to get home late (Sunday), and 
we will come back rejuvenated 
and ready to go.”

Eastern 
Michigan 
(2-4 

Mid-American 
Conference, 

9-21 
overall) 
has 
had 
an 

immensely different schedule 
than Michigan, playing just 
three games against ranked 
opponents so far. The Eagles 
were mercy-ruled twice and 
lost by five runs in the third 
game.

Pitcher Lindsay Rich will 

likely start for the Eagles. 
Boasting a 6.71 earned-run 
average, Rich has pitched in 18 
games, far more than any of her 

teammates. 
Since 
Betsa 

pitched 
the 

entirety 
of 

Sunday’s 
matchup, 
Wagner 
will 
likely 

start 
in 
the 

circle for the 
Wolverines, 
though 
Hutchins 

won’t officially name a starter 
until game time.

Just 
like 
every 
outing, 

Eastern Michigan gives the 
Wolverines a chance to tune 
up, get a little bit better and 
stay in the groove. Though the 
Eagles won’t present the same 
challenge the Golden Gophers 
did, Hutchins instilled in her 
players’ minds that this game 
still counts toward their record, 
and is therefore to be taken 
seriously.

“We don’t think about the 

turnaround,” said sophomore 
infielder Lindsay Montemarano. 
“Anytime we get to step out on 
Alumni Field, which we don’t 
get to do a lot, we get excited. 
We know we are in season, and 
we have a ton of games to play.”

Of 
the 
numerous 
ways 

Eastern Michigan differs from 
Minnesota, Arizona State and 
Florida, it is similar in one.

Michigan 
views 
it 
as 
a 

roadblock.
