HOSPITAL
Student
clinic
razed
by fire
Only free clinic in
Livingston County
raises money to reopen
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily Staff Reporter
Last Monday morning the Uni-
versity of Michigan Student Run
Free Clinic in Pinckney, Mich. was
destroyed in what is believed to be an Special Olympian Devin Sparrow umps nto a tank at the Polar Plunge
electrical fire.
The building served as a dual
clinic housing the Faith Medical
Clinic and the student clinic -which
began working regular hours lon Oct.a
13 after a successful pilot program
last spring. Together, they were the
only free medical clinic in Livingston
County.
The building was destroyed com-
pletely, and supplies and equipment
such as printers, medication, ther-
mometers and blood pressure cuffs
were damaged beyond repair.
The student-run clinic's digital
patient files were spared because
the laptops they're stored on were
out of the building. The firefighters
were also able to save the file cabi-
nets holding Faith Medical Clinic's
patient records.'
Volunteers at the student clinic
heard about the fire on Monday
morning. Medical student Mohamad
Issa, a student director of the clinic,
said the news came as a shock.
"After the initial shock, we started
thinking about the patients," Issa
said. "Who would the patients see?
* What clinic could they go to until we
become operational again? It hurt at
first, but we recognize the commu-
nity needs us and we have all of these
established ties, which motivates
us to come back even stronger and K
to come back as fast as possible by
working with the community."

Union
Amer's, other
restaurant leases
expire in April
By PAULA FRIEDRICH
For the Daily
An anonymous Facebook
campaign is hoping to stir up
support to keep Amer's in the
Michigan Union after the deli's
lease expires in April.
According to Amer's owner
Amer Bathish, the page was
started by a frequent Amer's
customer and University fac-
ulty member in December,
and quickly gained followers.
Bathish said he didn't know the
customer's name.
The "Save Amer's in the
Michigan Union" Facebook
page currently has 675 likes and
is urging supporters to contact
E. Royster Harper, the Univer-
sity's vice president for student
affairs.
Harper said she has received
between 15 and 20 e-mails sup-
porting Amer's, including some
from Bathish's relatives.
Susan Pile, the director of the
Michigan Union and Campus
Involvement, said the Univer-
sity is currently sifting through
,number of options - includig
the possibility of a University-
run cafe - to fill the space. She
estimated that a decision will be
reached by mid-April.
Harper also said she was sus-
picious that Bathish created the
Facebook page himself, instead
of concerned community mem-
bers.
"We have every reason to
believe that this is not an organ-
ic, from-the-people mnovement,"
Harper said, adding that the
Facebook campaign is being
mounted when Bathish should
be focusing on sending a pro-
posal.

Competitors brave
frigid water at
Big House for
Special Olympics
By STEVE ZOSKI
DailyStaffReporter
On the more temperate Satur-
days in the fall, football games in
the Big House routinely attract
more than 100,000 people. But
on a chilly February morning,
a much smaller, less-clothed
crowd convened to raise about
$130,000 for Special Olympics
Michigan by jumping into pools
of freezing water.
"Hail to the Victors" played
through the stadium's speak-
er system Saturday morning
as the first ever Polar Bear
Plunge began. Cheers and cam-
era flashes emanated from the
bleachers asa crowd of over 300
plungers-to-be gathered in the
locker rooms to hear pep talks
from head football coach Brady
Hoke and former head coach
Lloyd Carr. Moments later,
lines of people trotted down
the iconic tunnel and under

the "Go Blue" banner wear-
ing costumes, bearing skin and
braving the cold before finally
taking their turns plummeting
into two inflated swimming
pools set up along the visitors'
sideline.
United State Coast Guard vol-
unteers worked as lifeguards,
helping people quickly escape
out of the frigid water into
the refuge of a white towel's
embrace.
Sitting at a long table in
between the two pools, judges
Hoke and Carr, WDIV sports-
caster Bernie Smilovitz and Ann
Arbor Police Chief John Seto
observed as people made the
plunge. Awards were given in
categories that included "Best
Jump," "Best Costume" and
"Most Michigan Gear" in an
indoor reception following the
event.
Costumes included two Uni-
versity hospital employees in
Ghostbusters gear, a plunger in
full football pads and a troupe
dressed up as the Spartans
from"300."

UMHS physician
and son spearhead
donations drive
By LIANA ROSENBLOOM
Daily StaffReporter
As a part of a cross-campus
competition, University stu-
dents have partnered with
students from Michigan State
University to make wishes
come true for children who are
patients at C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital and Sparrow Hospital
in Lansing.
From Feb. 25 to March 1,
student volunteers will be col-
lectiag donations at booths
and online on both campus-
es to "Make Blue and Green
Wishes Come True." The col-
legiate challenge aims to raise
$25,000 per campus during the
week leading up to the men's
basketball game, against Mich-
igan State, March 3.
Gregory Yanik, a profes-
sor of pediatrics and internal

medicine, is a member of the
executive committee of the
Make-A-Wish Foundation of
Michigan. He said the fun-
draiser began to take shape
when his son, LSA senior Bran-
don Yanik, approached him
with the idea in late 2012. Plan-
ning started by the beginning
of the winter semester.
"I grew up around Mott
hospital and I grew up around
these kids," Brandon said. "I
think it's just great to be able
to put a smile on these kids'
faces."
Gregory said he and Bran-
don were walking through
the Union one day when they
decided to stop in the office of
Student Activities and Lead-
ership to ask for assistance
with finding a student group
on campus to get involved and
were led to community service
fraternity Alpha Phi Omega.
They also contacted MSU
senior Daniel McAree, a family
friend; and MSU-STARS, the
MSU student Make-A-Wish
Foundation group.

Gregory said he and the stu-
dents sent proposals to both
universities and the Make-A-
Wish Foundation for approval.
For the past two months,
groups on both campuses have
been working to design dona-
tion websites and Facebook
pages, gather volunteers and
advertise the event.
LSA senior Briana Lucido,
co-chair of the Make-A-Wish
Foundation committee for
Alpha Phi Omega, said the
project was an opportunity the
fraternity just couldn't pass up.
"Personally, I am honored
to be involved with such an
event because it has so much
potential and everyone who is
working on it is really passion-
ate about making it such a suc-
cess," Lucido said.
McAree said students have
been making presentations at
fraternity and sorority meet-
ings for the past few weeks to
gain support 'from the Greek
community at MSU. He also

BBEAT BATTLE

Liquor store burns down in morning fire

75 years ago this week
(February25,1938):
A fire that lasted three hours
destroyed a liquor store at 113
W. Huron Street, causing an
estimated $50,000 in damage.
The small fire, started by a pile
of smoldering coals in the base-
ment, quickly escalated when
it hit bottles of liquor and pure
alcohol.
Ann Arbor Fire Chief Charles
J. Andrews mobilized all avail-
able equipment and manpower
to fight the blaze. Many firefight-
ers were cut by flying glass and
forced to draw back because of
heavy smoke.
The neighboring businesses,
Davenport's Restaurant and

Miller's barbershop, were affect-
ed only by the smoke. The fire
was first noticed at 9 a.m. and
was under control by noon.
50 years ago this week
(February 26,1963):
After spring rush and pledg-
ing left some sorority houses
with empty rooms, Panhellen-
ic Association President Ann
McMillan predicted the associa-
tion would recommend a revi-
sion to the rush program.
McMillan said re-implement-
ing a fall rush could help solve
the problem. A fall rushing
system was used at the Univer-
sity from 1952 to 1957, but was
changed due to a student govern-

ment council vote.
The proposal return to a fall
rush systemwas sent for approv-
al by the Assembly Association
and student representatives.
20 years ago this week
(March 1,1993):
The Michigan women's swim-
ming and diving team won their
seventh consecutive Big Ten
Championship at Canham Nata-
torium, narrowly beating out
Northwestern's team 676-628.
This win set a record in women's
athletics for most consecutive
championship victories.

Top Israeli army
officals met over
weekend to discuss
growing unrest
RAMALLAH, West Bank
(AP) - The mysterious death
of a 30-year-old Palestinian
gas station attendant in Israeli
custody stoked new West Bank
clashes Sunday, along with
Israeli fears of a third Palestin-
ian uprising.
A senior Palestinian official
alleged that Arafat Jaradat
was tortured by Israel's Shin
Bet security service, citing an
autopsy he said revealed bruis-
ing and two broken ribs.
Israel's Health Ministry said
the autopsy did not conclusively
determine the cause of death,
but that the bruising and bro-
ken ribs were likely the result of
attempts to revive the detainee.
Jaradat's death came at a
time of rising West Bank ten-
sions, including several days
of Palestinian marches in sup-
port of four hunger-striking
prisoners in Israeli lockups. In
all, Israel holds nearly 4,600
Palestinians, including dozens
who have never been formally
charged or tried.
Frozen Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, the recent re-elec-
tion of Israeli hard-line Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
a Palestinian cash crisis and the
Palestinians' sense ofbeingaban-
doned by the Arab world seem to
have created fertile ground for a
third Palestinian revolt.
Over the weekend, Israel's
army chief convened senior
commanders to discuss the
growing unrest.
Jaradat's death "is liable to
become the opening shot" in a
third uprising, Israeli military
commentator Alex Fishman
wrote in the Yediot Ahronot
daily Sunday, arguing that the
"Palestinian street has been
boiling with anger for a number
of weeks now."

However, Israeli officials
have previously expressed con-
cern about a new uprising, only
to see bursts of Palestinian pro-
tests fizzle.
The first uprising, marked
by stone-throwing protests and
commercial strikes, erupted in
the late 1980s and led to Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations. The
second uprising broke out in
2000, after failed talks on a
final peace deal, and was far
deadlier, with Israel reoccupy-
ing the West Bank in response
to bombings and shootings.
In recent years, the West
Bank has been relatively calm.
Despite recent tensions, the
Palestinian self-rule govern-
ment has not broken off secu-
rity coordination with Israel
in their joint campaign against
Islamic militants.
Palestinian activists also say
they learned from the mistakes
of the armed revolt a decade
ago and are turning to more
creative protests against Isra-
el's 45-year rule over lands they
want for a future state.
Former Palestinian security
chief Jibril Rajoub, speaking in
Hebrew on Israel Radio, tried
to reassure Israelis, declar-
ing Sunday "on behalf of the
entire Palestinian leadership
that there is no plan to lead to
bloodshed."
Jaradat, a father of two from
the West Bank village of Saeer,
died in Megiddo Prison in
northern Israel on Saturday, six
days after his arrest on suspi-
cion of stone throwing.
Jaradat's attorney, Kamil
Sabbagh, said his client told an
Israeli military judge Thursday
during a heating that he was
being forced to sit for long peri-
ods during interrogation. He
also complained of back pain
and seemed terrified to return
to the Shin Bet lockup, although
he did not have any apparent
signs of physical abuse, Sab-
bagh said.
After the court hearing, the
judge ordered Jaradat to be
examined by a prison doctor.

The Shin Bet said that dur-
ing interrogation, Jaradat was
examined several times by a
doctor who detected no health
problems. On Saturday, he was
in his cell and felt unwell after
lunch, the agency said.
"Rescue services and a doctor
were alerted and treated him,"
the statement said. But "they
didn't succeed in saving his life."
On Sunday, Israel's forensics
institute performed an autopsy
attended by a physician from
the Palestinian Authority.
After being briefed by the
Palestinian physician, Issa
Karake, the Palestinian min-
ister of prisoner affairs, told a
news conference late Sunday
that Jaradat had suffered two
broken ribs on the right side
of his chest. The autopsy also
showed bruises on Jaradat's
back and chest.
Israeli officials initially said
Jaradat apparently died of a
heart attack, but Karake said the
Palestinian physician told him
there was no evidence of that.
Later, Israel's Health Minis-
try said Jaradat did not suffer
from disease and that it was not
possible yet to determine his
cause of death conclusively.
Jaradat "faced harsh torture,
leading to his immediate, direct
death. Israel is fully responsible
for his killing," Karake said.
Protesting Jaradat's death,
Palestinians threw stones at
Israeli troops in several loca-
tions, including the West Bank
city of Hebron and at a check-
point near the military's Ofer
prison on Sunday. In two loca-
tions, troops fired tear gas and
rubber-coated steel pellets.
In the clash near the check-
point, troops fired live rounds,
shooting the 15-year-old son of
the commander of the Palestin-
ian Preventive Security Service
in the chest and stomach, said
Palestinian health official Dr.
Ahmed Bitawi. The teen, Walid
Hab al-Reeh, was in stable con-
dition, while another man was
wounded in the arm, Bitawi
said.

of the provincial government headquarters in Port Said, Egypt on Friday.
Elections in Egypt won't
calm turbulent streets

Castro says he
plans to establish
two-term limits
HAVANA (AP) - Raul Cas-
tro announced Sunday that he
will step down as Cuba's pres-
ident in 2018 following a final
five-year term, for the first
time putting a date on the end
of the Castro era. He tapped
rising star Miguel Diaz-Canel
as his top lieutenant and first
in the line of succession.
The 81-year-old Castro
also said he hopes to establish
two-term limits and age caps
for political offices inclciding
the presidency - an astonish-
ing prospect for a nation led
by Castro or his older brother
Fidel since the 1959 revolu-
tion.
The 52-year-old Diaz-
Canel is now a heartbeat from
the presidency and has risen
higher than any other Cuban
official who didn't directly
participate in the heady days
of the revolution.
"This will be my last term,"
Castro said, his voice firm.
In his 35-minute speech,
Castro hinted at other chang-
es to the constitution, some so
dramatic that they will have
to be ratified by the Cuban
people in a referendum. Still,
he scotched any idea that the
country would soon abandon
socialism, saying he had not
assumed the presidency in
order to destroy Cuba's sys-
tem.
"I was not chosen to be
president to restore capital-
ism to Cuba," he said. "I was

elected to defend, maintain
and continue to perfect social-
ism, not destroy it."
Castro fueled interest in
Sunday's legislative gathering
after mentioning on Friday
his possible retirement and
suggesting lightheartedly that
he had plans to resign at some
point.
It's now clear that he was
dead serious when he prom-
ised that Sunday's speech
would have fireworks, and
would touch on his future in
leadership.
Cuba is at a moment of "his-
toric transcendence," Castro
told lawmakers in speaking
of his decision to name Diaz-
Canel to the No. 2 job, replac-
ing the 81-year-old Jose
Ramon Machado Ventura,
who fought with the Castros
in the Sierra Maestra.
Castro said that Diaz-
Canel's promotion "represents
a definitive step in the config-
uration of the future leader-
ship of the nation through the
gradual and orderly transfer
of key roles to new genera-
tions."
Since taking over fromFidel
in 2006, Castro has instituted
a slate of important economic
and social changes, expanding
private enterprise, legalizing
a real estate market and relax-
ing hated travel restrictions.
Still, the country remains
ruled by the Communist Party
and any opposition to it lacks
legal recognition.
Castro has mentioned
term limits before, but he has
never said specifically when
he would step down, and the
concept has yet to be codified

into Cuban law.
If he keeps his word, Castro
will leave office no later than
2018. Cuban-American exiles
in the United States have
waited decades for the end of
the Castro era, although they
will likely be dismayed if it
ends on the brothers' terms.
Nevertheless, the promise
of a change at the top could
have deep significance for
U.S.-Cuba ties. The wording
of Washington's 51-year eco-
nomic embargo on the island
specifies that it cannot be lift-
ed while a Castro is in charge.
Fidel Castro is 86 and
retired, and has appeared
increasingly frail in recent
months. He made a surprise
appearance at Sunday's gath-
ering, receiving a thunderous
ovation from lawmakers.
Some analysts have specu-
lated that the Castros would
push a younger member of
their family into a top job, but
there was no hint of that Sun-
day.
While few things are ever
clear in Cuba's hermetically
sealed news environment,
rumblings that Diaz-Canel, an
electrical engineer by train-
ing and ex-minister of higher
education, might be in line for
a senior post have grown.
In recent weeks, he has fre-
quently been featured on state
television news broadcasts in
an apparent attempt to raise
his profile.
He also traveled to Ven-
ezuela in January for the sym-
bolic inauguration of Hugo
Chavez, a key Cuban ally who
had been re-elected president
but was too ill to be sworn in.

Morsi calls for vote
in attempt to end
widespread unrest
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's streets
are turning into a daily forum for
airing a range of social discon-
tents from labor conditions to
fuel shortages and the casualties
of myriad clashes over the past
two years.
Parliamentary elections
called over the weekend by the
Islamist president hold out little
hope for plucking the country
out of the turmoil. If anything,
the race is likely to fuel more
unrest and push Egypt closer to
economic collapse.
"The street has a life of its own
and it has little to do with elec-
tions. It is about people wanting

to make a living or make ends
meet," said Emad Gad, a promi-
nent analyst and a former law-
maker.
Islamist President Moham-
med Morsi called for parlia-
mentary elections to start in late
April and be held over four stages
ending in June. He was obliged
under the constitution to set the
date for the vote by Saturday.
His decree brought a sharp
reaction from Egypt's key oppo-
sition leader, Nobel Peace Lau-
reate Mohamed ElBaradei, who
said they would be a "recipe for
disaster" given the polarization
of the country and eroding state
authority.
On Saturday, ElBaradei
dropped a bombshell when he
called for a boycott of the vote.
An effective boycott by the oppo-
sition or widespread fraud would-

call the election's legitimacy into
question.
But in all likelihood, Morsi's
Muslim Brotherhood and its
ultraconservative Salafi allies
will fare well in the vote. The
Brotherhood has dominated
every election in the two years
since the 2011 uprising that oust-
ed autocrat Hosni Mubarak.
The mostly secular and lib-
eral opposition will likely trail
as they did in the last election for
parliament's lawmaking, lower
house in late 2011 and early
2012 - a pattern consistent with
every nationwide election post-
Mubarak.
President Morsi's Brother-
hood-dominated administra-
tion has been unable to curb the
street protests, strikes and crime
that have defined Egypt in the
two years since the uprising.

Suspect in MSU stabbing awaits court
Lansing-area police say they've arrested a suspect in the fatal stab-
bing of a Michigan State University student from suburban Detroit.
They say the suspect faces arraignment Monday in district court in
Mason.
Meridian Township police Sgt. Andrew McCready tells The Detroit
News that 23-year-old Andrew M. Singler was stabbed about 4 a.m. Sat-
urday at an apartment complex near campus and died shortly after his
roommate brought him to the emergency room at Lansing's Sparrow
Hospital.
McCready says Singler was from the Rochester area in Oakland
County.
The sergeant says Singler apparently knew his killer and the two got
in some kind of argument before the stabbing. He says police arrested
the suspect about two hours after the attack and says he's in the Ingham
County jail.
NEW YORK
Romney grants post-election interview
Fox's Chris Wallace has landed the first postelection interview
with defeated Republican nominee Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann.
Wallace said on "Fox News Sunday" that the interview will air
on his show next week. Additional portions will be on Fox News
Channel the next day. Wallace says he'll ask Romney how he has
dealt with the defeat, what he plans to do and his thoughts about
President Barack Obama's second-term agenda.
Fox News spokeswoman Ashley Nerz says the interview will be
taped this week in southern California, where Romney has spent
much of his time since the election.
Romney has also said he will speak March 15 to the Conservative
Political Action Conference in Washington, an annual event that
draws leading Republican voices.
LONDON
* Banksy graffiti auction halted in UK
A mural by secretive graffiti artist Banksy has been withdrawn from
an auction sale after a campaign by London residents to reclaim it.
The stencil of a young boy sewing Union Jack bunting on an antique
sewing machine vanished earlier this month from the side of a north
London bargain store. Only exposed brick remained at the site, but the
artwork has appeared on the website of a Miami auction house.
The mural was due to be sold Saturday with an estimated price of
between $500,000 and $700,000. Fine Art Auctions Miami later said
that the item was withdrawn from sale, though it did not explain why.
Claire Kober, leader of local authority Haringey Council, said it will
now try to bring the artwork back to the community.
KHARTOUM, Darfur
Tribal fighting in Darfur leaves 60 dead
Renewed fighting between two Arab tribes over mining rights has
left 60 people dead in the northern Darfur region, Sudan's state news
agency said Sunday.
The state news agency said fighting on Saturday was the worst since
a cease-fire agreement was reached last month. The agency said fight-
ing began when a group of armed tribesmen in vehicles and riding
camels attacked the El-Sireaf area in North Darfur.
Sudan's western region of Darfur has been afflicted by violence
since 2003, when rebels took up arms against the central government
in Khartoum. Fighting also periodically erupts between tribes in the
area.

Dropping science (funding)
Sequestration could seriously hurt University research
n March 1, the University stands to lose nearly $40 mil-
lion in federal research funding if Congress and the White
House fail to defer the automatic cuts imposed by upcom-
ing sequestration that sheds $2 trillion in spending over 10 years. The
across-the-board cuts were planned in 2011 as an incentive to reach a
deal and were delayed until 2012. As a result, research funding faces a
$12-billion reduction as part of larger budget cuts. Emblematic of ever-
shrinking research funding on both state and national levels, these
cuts diminish the budget for a critical source of innovation. Cutting
funding for research runs counter to goals set by the President and
should be a government priority.

(Between men and women) there is far less agreement
for ambiguous behaviors that could be considered
either as signs of mere friendship or as signaling
deeper sexual interest:'
Researchers from the University wrote in a recently published article, "Was that Cheating? Perceptions Vary by
Sex, Attachment Anxiety and Behavior." Subjects ranked sitting in someone's lap as more adulterous than going
out to dinner, but less unfaithful than forming deep emotional bonds.

When compared against the $1.27 billion
invested in research at the University this
past year, $795 million of which was from the
federal government, $40 million may seem
insignificant. Much of the research that uni-
versities engage in is basic research - the
basics from which innovation springs.
Federally funded scientific research has
given us everything from better medical
treatments to higher-yielding crops to glob-
al positioning satellites. Recognizing the
importance of scientific research, President
Obama declared in his State of the Union that,
"Now is not the time to gut these job-creating
investments in science and innovation. Now
is the time to reach a level of research and
development not seen since the height of the
Space Race."
Research not only gives the economy a
boost through better technology, but also
advances the education ofresearchers, college

students and the public at large. Stipulations
of public disclosure and public engagement
for funding coming from the government are
rarely required by private investors.
Furthermore, the cultural impact of scien-
tific research can be just as important as the
economic side. Though Obama claimed that
every dollar invested in the Human Genome
Project returned $140 to the economy, he failed
to account for the existential benefits that come
with knowing what really makes up a person.
Since their respective inceptions, universi-
ties have been bastions of scientific research
and federally funded science has sought to
explore frontiers that were not addressed in
the market for research and development.
The two have benefited each other and, in
doing so, have bettered the citizens of this
country and the world. A commitment to con-
tinued scientific excellence is essential to a
competitive nation.

After 50 years of policies
that have turned the
Middle East against us
- supporting
dictators, aid-
ing terrorist
groups, bombing
innocent civil-
ians and giving
unfaltering
support to the
nation of Israel J
- we somehowJBRENNAN
still don't get BRENNAN
it. Even in our
response to
9/11, in which we've lost thousands
of soldiers in pointless wars and
become economically unstable
along the way - we've refused
to read the writing on the wall.
Instead, we cover our ears, shut
our eyes and shout, "I'm not listen-
ing!" at the top of our lungs.
Over the past two weeks, we've
witnessed the first filibuster against
Secretary of Defense nominee
Chuck Hagel. At the same time John
Brennan, President Barack Obama's
pick for head of the CIA, continues
skirting questions surrounding the
legality of killing civilians without
due process, brought on by drone
strikes in the region.
Hagel has been criticized for his
views on Israel as well as his will-
ingness to directly negotiate with
Hamas and Iran. Though Hagel's
suggestion to reach out diplomati-
cally and discontinue unquestion-
ing worship of Israel is a fresh take
on failed foreign policy, Republi-
cans refuse to support him.
The GOP is not alone in continu-
ing America's failed foreign policy.
The Obama administration has car-

ried out countless assassinations
in the past four years - some on
American soil. John Brennan, chief
counterterrorism advisor to the
president, refuses to answer wheth-
er or not United States citizens can
be targeted by drone strikes. Per-
haps even more troubling is the
fact that rather than engaging in a
meaningful debate about the pos-
sible negative repercussions of
drones, such as their propensity for
collateral damage, we're instead
discussing the president's authority
to decide an individual's fate.
Our foreign policy has repeatedly
led to our demise as a nation. After
9/11, Osama bin Laden released vid-
eos directly citing the actions of the
U.S. - supporting Israel, bombing
Iraq and stationing troops in Saudi
Arabia - as motivation for the ter-
rorist attacks. I won't sit here and
defend a terrorist who killed inno-
cent civilians, but I certainly won't
pretend the United States hasn't
done the same thing.
Our foreign policy is broken. We
wage endless wars, destroy the lives
of countless innocent civilians and
breed hatred for our country. Rather
than taking steps to spread peace,
we proliferate violence and death.
Drone strikes and unwavering sup-
port for Israel are just a minor rea-
son so many people want to destroy
us. It isn't our freedom, it isn't our
wealth - it's our foreign policy.
Even a Democratic president - a
man awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
and who we believed would lead us
to peace - has continued America's
trend as a war-hungry nation. Dur-
ingthe Vietnam War, Martin Luther
King Jr. once famously called Amer-
ica "the greatest purveyor of vio-

lence in the world today." If King
were alive right now, he would prob-
ably saythe same thing.
We can't forget
that our goal is
peace, not just
victory.
When I voted for president this
year, I felt ashamed. I knew that vot-
ing for anyone other than Obama
would essentially be a vote for Rom-
ney - a man running counter to the
nation's best interests. So instead I
voted for Obama and havefelt noth-
ing but regret since. My vote was for
a man who authorizes drone strikes
that kill civilians, for a man who has
expanded our military and, worst
of all, for a man who now refuses to
examine the legality of killing civil-
ians on U.S. citizens.
Republicans and Democrats are
both to blame for countless acts
of death and destruction through-
out the world. Maybe one party is
more at fault than the other, but it
doesn't matter. What matters is the
present and what we can do about
things now. We can stop ourselves
from killing more people, and we
can stop ourselves from inciting
more violence. What we must keep
in mind is that our goal is not vic-
tory - it's peace.

Last week, a group of University of Michi-
gan students crowded the Diag and the Refer-
ence Room in the Hatcher Graduate Library
to add to a collection of recent viral videos
inspired by "Harlem Shake," a track by Baau-
er. Like many of the other clips, the Univer-
sity's take on it starts off with a single person
so eloquently thrusting his crotch in Wolver-
ine apparel until Baauer's beat drops, when a
mass of students appear clad in neon jump-
suits, boas, rainbow socks, masks, my great
aunt's faux-fur collection from the 80s or
nothing at all. For the next 30 seconds, every-
one in the frame is gyrating and dry humping
the ground, air and each other so vigorously
that I'm concerned that bath salts and Four
Loko are a thing again. Of course, the video
has blown up in an "I'm Shmacked" fashion,
with close to 85,000 hits since Feb. 16.
What confuses me the most about the
popularity of these fad clips is that they don't
in any way feature the real Harlem Shake,
a dance with a long history that originated
in Harlem in the early 1980s. It was first
referred to as the "albee," named after Har-
lem resident Al B, creator of the dance.
It wasn't called the Harlem Shake until its
popularity grew outside of the Harlem com-
munity. The dance gained mainstream recog-
nition in the early 2000s. Blah blah blah - I
know you don't care. What I'm trying to say
is these videos completely and unabashedly
disregard the Harlem Shake and its rich cul-
tural history.
Perhaps I'm being a tad overzealous.
Couldn't these videos just be a way to reinter-
pret old traditions and create something new?
Isn't that what creative process and exchange is
all about? A survey of the video says no.
These videos don't have an inch of creativ-
ity in the first place. They're unoriginal dupli-
cates of a bunch of bored kids with cameras
making absolute fools of themselves.

But even if it has nothing to do with the
original dance, aren't these videos just harm-
less fun? Think again. Far from harmless,
they're offensive and belittling. Bottom line,
the Harlem Shake phenomena is appropria-
tion without proper recognition of a dance
that has been culturally significant to Harlem
for 30 years.
Who am I, really, a Midwestern white boy
to flaunt my almost obsessive opinion about
a dance that I only think I could do after five
shots from a place that I've only visited. To
that I say you should watch SchleppFilms'
video, a compilation of street interviews of
Harlemites' reactions to a variety of Harlem
Shake videos. Apart from the astonished, con-
fused and offended jaw drops, headshakes and
eye rolls, community members had a lot to say
about this recent fad, including:
"It's an absolute mockery of what it was
because there's actually a sense of uh, rhythm
that goes along with it."
"It's actually an art form, a dance art form,
that doesn't have the respect that it should
deserve."
And my absolute favorite: "Y'all need to
stop that shit."
What's really disappointing to me is that
members of the University of Michigan have
- albeit unknowingly - openly and proudly
insulted not just a dance, but also a vibrant,
lively, diverse community. We need to stop
and think about the implications of what we
do when we need a fun distraction because
we're uninterested, hungover and don't want
to do what we're actually here to do - to
respect and appreciate a plethora of diverse
cultural expressions. It's time to find a new
hobby, Michigan. Next time just plug in some
G. Dep, watch Harlem's reaction and learn the
real Harlem shake.

OMAR MAHMOOD N
50:
This Labor Day weekend found
me in New York at my mother's
cousin's wedding. I came away with
some new snippets of family history
that appeal wonderfully to a roman-
tic like me - particularly one of a
great-great uncle, or so I suppose
is his relation. He came to America
in 1904 and ended up studying in
Ann Arbor. Then he rose in ranks at
General Motors, and later he went
back home to India.
I've been told that he came to
Ann Arbor to see the world. The
world happens to be a 40-minute
drive from West Bloomfield and the
halls of Detroit Country Day School
- places far more diverse than the
Diag. With apologies to marketers,
that whole "diversity" line doesn't
work anymore because, well, the
world is quickly becoming the world.
My mother was born in Pakistan.
I hadn't been there for years until
I visited again last summer for a
wedding. The groom's brother, a
cousin of mine, took his whole day
to show us around Karachi, the
nation's largest city. His tour unfor-
tunately confirmed my ill judgment
of Pakistani pop culture. Today,
Pakistani culture is simply a shame-
less attempt to be American. He
took us to a mall where the national
language of Urdu was effectively
banned. He showed us a Texas-

shades of beige

themed restaurant where you had to
act rowdy and throw peanut husks
on the floor to prove how Texan you
were. I think I was supposed to have
been impressed by how open and
forward Pakistan is.
Even my parents don't seem to
understand. I always beg my father
not to answer my Urdu with Eng-
lish. I don't do it because I need to
know Urdu - just watch any Bolly-
wood movie and you'll know what
I mean. I want to be the man that
tradition would have made me if
globalization hadn't gotten in the
way. So I brought two pairs of shal-
war kurtas to my dorm to wear to
the Union for Friday prayer. It was
a matter of concern for my friends,
who wondered why I was trying so
hard to be Pakistani. But my long,
flowing, salmon-pink shirt didn't
stand out as much as it would have
in that Karachi mall.
I went to Ghana two summers
ago with Unite for Sight, a blind-
ness-prevention NGO. There, any-
one who's anyone speaks English,
and there was no real need to speak
the native Twi. Still I learned it,
and I impressed upon the' locals
that an obruni who would only
be with them for some days had
learned their tongue, and that their
language was a treasure to hold.
Here, we celebrate diversity in

good American spirit. Yet we don't
consider that the more we "cele-
brate" diversity, the more we lose it.
Indian student organizations walk
around with shirts bearing words,
in English, that look like Deva-
nagari but are only mimicries of
those soon-to-be lost letters. Rus-
sell Peters once joked, "300 hun-
dred years from now ... everybody's
gonna be beige." I defer to Russell
and mourn, too, at words that her-
ald a global language called English
that sounds like a computer manu-
al, a far cry from the rustic echoes
on England's greenest hills.
The world moves too fast to hold
the yoke of modernity, to ever beget
again the beautiful traditions that
evolved and ripened over ages of
natural change and migration. So,
in three hundred years when we
are this inevitable hodgepodge of
beige, will anyone ever feel the
thrill of hearing a tongue wholly
new, a people read only in books?
Will ever another man have a jour-
ney like my great-great uncle? No.
So your hopeless sentimentalist
resigns and lies down, and closes
his eyes to the melody of a band
of qawwals, singing the poetry of
Amir Khusro, the Sufi saint, and
only then can he be true for a while.
Omar Mahmood is an LSA freshman.

Afghanistan: U.S. special
forces must leave province

Cuba's tapped heir-apparent
is largely unknown globally

Troops asked to leave
eastern area after
reports of abuse
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- Afghanistan's president
ordered all U.S. special forces
to leave a strategically impor-
tant eastern province within
two weeks because of allega-
tions that Afghans working
with them are torturing and
abusing other Afghans.
The decision Sunday seems
to have surprised the coalition
and U.S. Forces Afghanistan, a
separate command. Americans
have frequently angered the
Afghan public over issues rang-
ing from Qurans burned at a
U.S. base to allegations of civil-
ian killings.
"We take all allegations of
misconduct seriously and go to
great lengths to determine the
facts surrounding them," the
U.S. forces said in a statement.
Also Sunday, a series of

attacks in eastern Afghanistan
showed insurgents remain on
the offensive even as U.S. and
other international forces pre-
pare to end their combat mis-
sion by the end of 2014.
Suicide bombers targeted
Afghanistan's intelligence'
agency and other security forc-
es in four coordinated attacks
in the heart of Kabul and outly-
ing areas in a bloody reminder
of the insurgency's reach nearly
12 years into the war.
Presidential spokesman
Aimal Faizi said the decision
to order the American special
forces to leave Wardak province
was taken during a meeting of
the National Security Council
because of the alleged actions
of Afghans who are considered
linked to the U.S. special forces.
He said all special forces
operations were to cease imme-
diately in the restive province
next to Kabul, which is viewed
as a gateway to the capital and
has been the focus of counter-
insurgency efforts in recent

years.
The Taliban have staged
numerous attacks against U.S.-
led coalition forces in the prov-
ince. In August 2011, insurgents
shot down a Chinook helicop-
ter, killing 30 American troops,
mostly elite Navy SEALs, in
Wardak. The crash was the sin-
gle deadliest loss for U.S. forces
in the war.
Afghan forces have taken
the lead in many such special
operations, especially so-called
night raids.
"Those Afghans in these
armed groups who are working
with the U.S. special forces, the
defense minister asked for an
explanation of who they are,"
Faizi said. "Those individuals
should be handed over to the
Afghan side so that we can fur-
ther investigate."
A statement the security
council issued in English said
the armed individuals have
allegedly been "harassing,
annoying, torturing and even
murdering innocent people."

Diaz-Canel has
gradually risen
to No. 2 post
HAVANA (AP) - The man
tapped as the likely heir-appar-
ent to Raul Castro is largely
unknown off the island, but his
rise to the country's No. 2job was
anything but meteoric.
Miguel Diaz-Canel has spent
30 years gradually paying his
dues behind the scenes, earn-
ing a reputation as a Communist
Party loyalist and rising through
the ranks to a succession of ever-
higher posts.
"He is not an upstart or impro-
vised," President Raul Castro
said Sunday in a speech to law-
makers in which he laid out the
reasons for his choice. In the

past, Castro has praised Diaz-
Canel's "solid ideological firm-
ness."
Tall, dapper and carefully
groomed with a 52-year-old's
salt-and-pepper hair, Diaz-Canel
presents a serious public face
before TV cameras, even as some
people who know him describe
him as a sharp-minded jokester
who can be surprisingly relaxed
in private.
"He's a much more flexible
type than he seems, open-mind-
ed and above all intelligent," one
official who has known Diaz-
Canel since the 1980s told The
Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, lacking the authori-
zation to discuss the man with
foreign media.
Others, particularly those off
the island, described him in less
flattering terms.

"I think it's interesting
because Diaz-Canel is not a
charismatic person," said Ale-
jandro Barreras, who runs a blog
in Miami called On Two Shores
that advocates for a normaliza-
tion of relations between the
US and Cuba. "He's kind of an
opaque figure."
Diaz-Canel's profile has risen
in recent months as he repeat-
edly appeared on state TV news-
casts. One day he was speaking
about Cuba's national baseball
team, the next he was inaugurat-
ing Havana's International Book
Fair.
In January he traveled to
Venezuela and spoke promi-
nently at a mega-rally in
support of cancer-stricken
President Hugo Chavez, argu-
ably Havana's most important
international ally.

process about their past inter-
national experiences, what they
might gain from the symposium
and what they could contribute
to the event.
LSA sophomore Courtney
Green, co-chair of Students for
Global Engagement, said the
quality of speakers and discus-
sion afterwards were exactly
what the symposium needed.
"We have been really
impressed by (the speakers')
talks and their experiences. We
have been working with them
to make sure that their talks are
reflective of our goals," Green
said. "I think this has been a
wonderful opportunity to bring
students together to think criti-
cally about their past experienc-
es and future experiences."
Social Work graduate student
Craig Laurie kicked off the event
about tensions between global
engagement and international-
ization.
Laurie stressed that global
exchanges must be a two-way,
give-and-take relationship. He
also reflected on his experiences
in the Peace Corps in Moldova,
and highlighted the importance
of the University's study abroad
scholarship through the LSA
Student Government.

Hoke said. "I'm not looking for
style or dives, or anything like
that. I've seen a guy who was
pretty much covered head to toe,
so that was our winner."
Smilovitz, the WDIV sports-
caster, was given the task of
determining for the most unique
plunger.
"They just told me (to look out
for) whatever was creative and
different; and that's sort of the
story of my life, creative and dif-
ferent, so I'm in, this was right
up my alley, perfectly," Smilovitz
said.
"I thought that the ones that
had the least amount of costumes
were the most creative ones,"
Smilovitz continued. "If you're
going into the polar plunge you

would think that you'd bundle,
but the ones that didn't are the
ones that really impressed me."
Kim Purdy, the chief market-
ing & development officer of Spe-
cial Olympics Michigan, said the
inaugural Big House event was
definitely unique.
"The athletic department
has just been incredible to work
with," Purdy said. "They've been
incredibly organized, it's just an
amazing thing for our organiza-
tion."
Coast Guard Sgt. Kevin Wesner
said his dive team volunteers for
Special Olympics' plunges every
year.
"It's the biggest one we've
ever done," Wesner said. "Great
event."
Wesner said the water in the
pools was forty degrees Fahr-
enheit when pumped from a fire
hydrant, but the many bags of ice
dropped in the water likely made
it even cooler.

the Union, Bathish said he is not
sure what his next step would be,
but said the potential loss would
be "personally devastating."
"I move with whatever the
students want," Bathish said.
"My whole focus is only on the
students, and then the faculty

and visitors and staff -they just
get the benefits of what the stu-
dent gets."
Bathish's bid proposal to Uni-
versity Unions - sent in Janu-
ary - will be considered within
the next several weeks. Harper
said a proper proposal would
detail improvements he wants
to make to the current restau-
rant if he wants Amer's to stay.
Ranae Reilly, manager of

Amer's Cafe in the Union,
said she believes the Facebook
group will help the deli's cause
because it shows a high level of
customer satisfaction.
"The University's goal
should be to make students
happy or the people who work
here happy."

area and the University of Michi-
gan Health System. They have
also created a place for donations
on their Facebook page.
"Currently we're contacting
various organizations to try and
facilitate donations for every-
thing from tableside beds to
chairs to stools to scales," Issa
said. "So when we find a new
facility we will have all the equip-
ment to be operational."
Since the student clinic
opened, it has seen more than
150 unique patients and experi-
enced a surge in student volun-
teers, said Hari Conjeevaram,
the clinic's medical director and
an associate professor of medi-
cine.
Faith Medical Clinic leased
the building from Putnam
Township - the town in which
the village of Pinckney islocated
- for $1 a year, but the township
has not decided whether they
will rebuild.
Despite losing the build-
ing, both clinics are working to
reopen in another location. Faith
Medical Clinic has added a Pay-
Pal donation link to its website
to support the clinic's continued
existence. In addition, an emer-

gency benefithas beenscheduled
for next weekend at the Mission
Church in Pinckney, Faith Clinic
founder Laura Goldman said.
"The services we have been
able to offer to the uninsured have
been quite tremendous," Conje-
evaram said. "The need is there
and that's one of the reasons we
want to get back on track ... We're
booked with patients and volun-
teers for the next few months."
Conjeevaram said he's seen an
outpouring of support from the
UMHS community to help the
clinic get back on its feet.
"One of the things that has
happened over the last couple
of days is that a lot of students
who have yet to volunteer at the
clinic and a lot of faculty have
been calling and e-mailing us
about how they can help," Conje-
evaram said.
Although many medical stu-
dents are currently on break or
facing exams, the Michigan com-
munity has mobilized to try to get
the clinic up and running as soon
as possible, Conjeevaram said.
Conjeevaram said the relation-
ship between Faith Medical Clin-
ic and the student-run clinic has
been beneficial in fostering an
environment conducive to learn-
ing and interacting with patients.
"One of the key things with

(Faith Medical Clinic), not only
did they allow us to use their
clinic for our clinic, but the most
inspiring thing is that (Goldman)
was struggling with not having
a place for medical students to
practice, she felt like she was let-
ting them down," he said.
Goldman said the group plans
to rebuild the clinic, but has not
yet decided on a new location.
She said organizers are debating
between two buildings - the old
Putnam Township firehouse and
a church in Brighton. Both clin-
ics hope to be up and running in
the next two to four weeks after
a new space is determined and
basic equipment is acquired.
Faith Medical Clinic and
the student-run clinic are cur-
rently working to collect neces-
sary medical supplies and find a
temporary solution for the free
clinic.
"All of these people we've
interacted with and their amaz-
ing stories have defined our first
two years of medical school,"
Issa, the student clinic director
said. "They have enriched our
experience and touched our lives
in ways that we can't ever give
back. This motivates us; when
we re-open, we want the clinic
to be better, stronger and more
responsive to community needs."


the stuff that the institution
or organization is doing, it is
your responsibility, and you are
accountable," Laurie said.
Following Laurie, Rackham
student Megan Levanduski gave.
a speech titled "Bend Without
Breaking: Negotiating Gen-
der Identities in Kazakhstan"
focusing on her experience
creating an all-girls health and
fitness camp while working in
the Peace Corps. Levanduski
highlighted the necessity of
remaining flexible while travel-
ing abroad, especially in under-
standing gender norms. She
achieved her goal of creating an
all-girls health camp by chang-
ing the original name of a girls
"leadership" camp to a "health
and fitness" camp in order to
work with the traditional gen-
der roles of Kazakhstan.
"This didn't change who I was
as a woman and didn't change
my message, but it allowed me to
show the people I was working
with that I was trying to under-
stand where they were coming
from, and I was trying to meet
them halfway," Levanduski said.
While reflecting on her own
study abroad experience, LSA
sophomore Jehan Jawad, a mem-
ber of the Students for Global
Engagement, said she agrees that
it is difficult to balance respect-
ing another culture while main-
taining one's own values.
"There is a thin line between

someone else's values and your
own," Jawad said. "What's key
is keeping an open mind and
knowing that you have to be
flexible in your own values and
practices."
Engineering seniors Sita Syal
and Carrie Tamarelli discussed
"Appropriate Technology for
Global Development." They sug-
gested that technology can be
a useful way to spur regional
development.
Syal stressed that it's crucial
to work with the community in
order to find the best solution.
"When you focused really
on the human-centered part of
this design ... that's when you
and your community can come
up with sustainable solutions to
development," Syal said.
LSA sophomore Layne Van-
denberg traveled abroad with
MPowered's Kenya Project last
summer. Vandenberg said she
could relate to the teachings of
the symposium because it was
essential to understand Kenyan
culture in order to best serve
the local people while she was
there.
"Without their input, our
ideas would not have worked and
they wouldn't be tailored to the
culture we were working with,"
Vandenberg said. "We have cer-
tain perceptions of what we
think people need, but it can be
completely different from what
people actually want."

"That's another testament to
how supportive the University
individuals are about making a
difference in someone's life and
really helping out someone how
needs it," Lucido said.
Gregory Yanik said this is the
first Make-A-Wish collegiate
challenge in Michigan. He hopes
the event will continue between
the two schools and will spread
to other colleges and universities.
"This is a grassroots effort
being run by two incredibly
well-meaning, energetic groups
of students on both campuses,"

Gregory said. "We are hoping
this will lay the groundwork
for similar campus challenges
across the country."
Gregory said he's very proud
of the event's progress thus far
and has high hopes for its suc-

Lucido said she is amazed by
the progress both campuses have
made so far.
"People never cease to amaze

Playstation 4 makes its
long-awaited debut

"Make sure you get my good side."
Joh nJorgenson's
musical journey

By STEVEN TWEEDIE
Daily TV/New Media Editor
Sony knows how to put on a
show. With a massive, immer-
sive screen wrapped around
the seated press, adorned with
spotlights and lasers to pierce
through the darkness and pulse
in time to the psychedelic music,
Sony practically manufactured
its own hype, allowing for people
around the world to tune in and
watch as the first next-gen con-
sole was unveiled. Even before
the first word was spoken, Sony
led its audience on a visual jour-
ney that celebrated, well, Sony
and its revolution of how people
"play," and stressed the trailblaz-
ing still to come. It's impossible to
watch the first few minutesof the
announcement and not find your-
self excited.
But is such excitement war-
ranted? As Sony Computer Enter-
tainment President Andrew
House took the stage to scattered

is the least important. People
don't buy a new game console
to stare at it (well, most people
don't); they care more about what
is under the hood and what deli-
cious scenery can be rendered
across their televisions.
Instead of a picture of the new

time has also drastically been
decreased, with your character

to a low-powered sleep mode.

Acoustic musician
provided diverse
sound at the Ark
By SHAMIK GANGULY
For the Daily
Hearing John Jorgenson and
his band play is the closest I'll
ever get to teleporting or traveling
through time. These four acoustic
masters sound like they've lived
a lifetime in every region of the
world, and they play like they have
two hours to tell you everything
you need to know about music, cul-
ture and history. I've never been to
a beach in Greece, but when John
Jorgenson pulls out his bouzouli,
I'm lying on the sand in the balmy
Mediterranean breeze, wearing a
tunic.
A modest audience surrounded
Jorgenson and his three band-
mates Feb. 21 at the Ark. I felt like
I'd stumbled into their living room
when I found myself sitting sid-
estage, listening to stories about a
lifetime of music and global expe-
rience.
Jorgenson relished the personal
atmosphere, and between small
talk with a drunk woman in the
audience and a reminiscent con-
versation
with a fan First seen on
about one -the filter

of his previous albums, he made it
clear that they appreciated being
able to perform in such a pure
acoustic atmosphere.
"We don't have Auto-Tune,"
he said. "We all actually play our
instruments."
He later complimented the
sound man on his lack of involve-
ment, saying, "A lot of sound guys
try to control our dynamics ... we
try to play really quiet and they
turn us up ... thanks for not doing
that."
With nothing but wood, fibers
and their hands between the band
members and their music, they
were fully in control. The drummer,
Rick Reed, had a simple three-piece
kit that he played alternately with
his brushes and his hands, but the
groove he produced was enormous.
He locked into a rumba, hitting his
snare like a conga, but five minutes
later he rolled through a fast gypsy
swing with his left leg pumping the
hi-hat and his brushes slapping the
backbeat.
Simon Planting, the bassist,
was deep in the pocket, too, and
between fast walks and soft bow
strokes he filled the room with
presence like a subwoofer. He
played with his neck craned down
toward the fretboard as if his bass
was whispering directions in his
ear, and his long hair flowed down
like a curtain between the audi-
ence and his intentions.

With a perpetual smile on his
face, violinist Jason Anick filled
the high end with jazzy slurs,
captivating tremolos and roman-
tic gypsy melodies. Sometimes
trading fours with Jorgenson and
sometimes taking the floor with
long chromatic runs and lilting
solos, he was the "singer" of the
group - that is, when Jorgenson
wasn't on the mic.
Jorgenson led the band with
contributions on the guitar, clari-
net, bouzouki and vocals. He was
part of the rhythm section, and he
was the melody at the same time.
He'd frequently rip through a high
chromatic run in unison with the
violin and then fall into a chord
progression instantaneously, sup-
porting the music and expressing
the composition in whatever way
was necessary.
Together, the four of them
nailed a set of songs from every
culture. They played old-time
country, French and Greek music,
rumba, lots of gypsy jazz and an
old tune by Fats Waller. In a set
with such variety, they maintained
a common theme of powerful
rhythm and enthralling emotion.
Never has a concert left me so
determined to both travel every-
where in the world and to sit down
and practice music all day long.

article was published on The Filter,

The next era of
consoles is
upon us.
Developer after developer
took the stage and previewed
their next-geo titles, with "Kill-
zone: Shadow Fall" and "Watch
Dogs" looking mighty fine. It's
also important to keep in mind
that even gameplay as impressive
as PlayStation 4 title "Killzone:
Shadow Fall" is only the begin-
ning, as developers will have at
least five years to methodically
optimize the graphical capabili-
ties of the PlayStation 4, pushing
what is possible (this is one reason
why graphics differ among games
on the same console, as increased
optimization = increased visual
splendor). So while PC users may
harp that "Crysis 3" on PC looks
better than anything Sony pre-
sented, the fact that developers
can design a game around a con-
sole's specifications and know
that everyone out there with a
PS4 has the same specifications is
a huge advantage, and allows for
intricate fine-tuning.
Sony also included some more
conceptual presentations to the
docket, showcasing future possi-
bilities with tech demos featuring
every pore on an old man's head,
though proving that increased
textures, polygon count and
graphical horsepower can help
eliminate the uncanny valley
(think "Avatar"-level facial fea-
tures).
Bottom Line
But at the end of the day, peo-
ple just want to know: Should
I upgrade and buy the bloody
thing? The question would be
better answered if Sony revealed
the PlayStation 4's pricing, but
who are we to expect prices at
a product announcement? With
no prices, and the possibility of
inflated prices at launch (remem-
ber when the 60-gigabyte Play-
Station 3 debuted to a $599 price
tag?), it might be worth it to wait
for whatever Microsoft has up its
sleeve and compare the two. Per-
haps compare upcoming titles,
check to see if there's any games
that you must have that are
console-specific. If you're feel-
ing adventurous, maybe look up
what a PC of equal horsepower
would cost you. Either way, the
next era of consoles is coming,
with wanted and unwanted fea-

NBC isn't the only broadcast
network struggling - ratings
are down across the board.
When the No. 1 drama on tele-
vision is AMC's "The Walking
Dead" and no broadcast dramas
are featured in the Outstanding
Drama Series category at the
Emmys, it's clear that the tele-
vision landscape has changed.
One change we may see is the
broadcast networks adopting a
cable-style model. Whereas a
full season on broadcast typi-
cally consists of 22-24 episodes
running nonconsecutively,
cable series produce fewer
episodes per season (typi-
cally 10-13), and run without
preemption. Not only would
this model lower costs, but
also increase quality and
make it easier to attract big-
ger names to broadcast. The
networks have already started
this process: NBC's upcoming
"Hannibal" will be limited to
13 episodes per season, while
Kevin Bacon's deal to star in
FOX's "The Following" is con-
tingent on a maximum of 15
episodes per year. This will
encourage viewers to stay com-
mitted to programs and limit
the risk of having to pull shows
mid-season.
NBC must also invest in com-
edy development. After this
season, the Peacock will basi-
cally have to start from scratch.
"The Office" will conclude
its nine-year run in May, "30
Rock" has already completed
its final season and every other
comedy is at high risk of can-
cellation: "Guys With Kids,"
"Whitney," "Go On," "The New
Normal," "1600 Penn," "Up All
Night" and "Community." By

May, it's conceivable NBC will
have only one sitcom left stand-
ing: "Parks and Recreation."
NBC has already committed
to 22 episodes of Michael J. Fox's
new untitled comedy. Other than
that, NBC execs have empha-
sized their interest in endors-
ing "broad" comedies - think
"Modern Family" versus "Don't
Trust the B---- in Apt. 23." The
former has wider appeal, while
the latter limited its viewership
to a more niche audience. This is
a well-intentioned plan, as long
as NBC doesn't confuse broad
with dumb (looking atyou, "Ani-
mal Practice").
This would likely result in
an increase in multi-camera
comedies on the schedule next
year; the notion that this is a
dying format just hasn't proven
to be true. CBS's multi-camera
roster, including "The Big Bang
Theory," "How I Met Your
Mother" and "2 Broke Girls,"
has shown that as far as ratings
are concerned, the format is far
from outdated.
With nothing to lose, NBC
should embrace the rapidly
changing television landscape.
Ten years ago, the thought
of cable series outperform-
ing the Big Four networks
was unimaginable - now,
this occurs on a nightly basis.
And viewing platforms have
changed; along with broadcast,
one can watch original series
on cable, premium cable or on
streaming services like Netflix.
Broadcast's reign is coming to a
close and from the way it looks,
NBC will be the first to fall.
The Peacock needs to get in
front of the curve while it can,
or else, much like "Revolution,"
the lights will go out.

No scares 'Skies

Accidental comedy
rehashes hollow

By JAMIE BIRCOLL
For the Daily
"Dark Skies" is really a cross
between "The X-Files," "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,"
and "Paranor-
mal Activity,"
but without C
any of the good
parts. It's a hor- Dark Skies

kind of movie
that will have
you asking, "Was there really
nothing better to see today?"
Yet it's mildly entertaining and
appealing enough that you won't
walk out of the theater,
The film stars Keri Russell
("Waitress") and relative new-
comer Josh Hamilton as Lacy and
Daniel Barrett, withDakotaGoyo
("Thor") and newcomer Kadan
Rockett as their two sons, Jesse
and Sam. They live in a quiet, sub-
urban town and are faced with
some economic issues but seem to
be doing alright. Then, one night,
Lacy awakens to a strange noise,
ventures downstairs and... all her
cans and silverware have been

stacked meticulously in the form
of unusual symbols. Then there
are instances of the lights flick-
ering, the house alarm going off,
mysterious bruises appearing -
nothing you haven't seen before.
There's also a side story about
Daniel not being able to find work
and Jesse having some pre-teen
experiences (like his first kiss);
neither ofthese threads have any-
thing to do with the plot and are
only modest attempts at charac-
ter development. Anyway, more
odd events occur, like hundreds
of birds fly into the windows.
Speaking of that bird scene, it's
an issue when an intended scary
moment elicits laughter from the
audience. Seriously, the entire
theater was laughing at the mass
bird suicide. That pretty much
sums up the scares in this movie:
They were timed correctly, but
executed poorly, and you can't call
yourself a horror movie, certainly
not a good one, when nobody
screams.
As far as characters go, Rus-
sell and Hamilton have only
a little chemistry and simply
aren't fit to play these charac-
ters. The audience should fear
what they fear, but we end up
looking at blank faces that can't
convey any anxiety or emotion.
One brief yet standout cameo
performance comes from J.K.
Simmons ("Burn After Read-
ing") as that one man whom
everyone thinks is crazy but

actually knows the truth. He
plays Edwin Pollard with defeat
and resignation, a man with all
the answers but who lost the
fight a long time ago. He knows
the Barrett family's situation is
hopeless, he's seen this plight
before. "You're not special," he
tells them.
Indeed, neither is this movie.
The always-necessary final stand
against the unknown menace is...
well, it's better than the rest of the
movie; certainly it adds more ten-
sion and has some heart-pound-
ing moments. It starts to turn
into a psychological thriller, but
then snaps right back into already
tread horror territory.
"Dark Skies" manages to
keep your interest somehow,
maybe by not really showing
what the aliens look like, maybe
by teasing you into thinking
that it'll finally scare you. But
then the credits roll, and you
leave unsatisfied. It could have
been better, the talent is there
in Russell, but writer/director
Scott Stewart ("Legion") sim-
ply cannot figure out what he
wants this movie to be.There's
a story to be told about aliens
having been around for cen-
turies, abducting people when
they see fit. "Dark Skies" is not
that story. But maybe the alien
abduction film has just run its
course - it has been around
since the 1950s. At this point,
it's nothing special.

Latest Usher track is
'Missin' 'lyrical, nuance

By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
ManagingArts Editor
For the second year in a row,
Usher and Diplo released a col-
laboration on Valentine's Day.
Though it lacks the emotional vul-
nerability and nuance of its elec-
trifying predecessor "Climax,"
the new "Go Missin' " is without
a doubt the most vocally intricate
number currently playing on pop
radio.
After a few too many club-
ready, clap track-laden appeals to

close to its level of originality), on
"Go Missin'," Usher reminds us
all he can sing. His lilting vocals
entice, backed by perfectly placed
drum machines and bouncing
synths. Usher's peculiar har-
monies make the track tonally
intriguing and a truly smooth lis-
ten. The intonations pulsate, cre-
ating an eerie sound that sways
throughout.
But no, listening to "Go Mis-
sin"' for the first time won't at all
feel like the first time you heard
"Climax",- mainly because that
raw, intense honesty isn't any-
where to be found. In fact, for the
entirety of the song, Usher is just

trying to get you to cheat on your
man with him. Sexy - am I right,
ladies?
It's no

Usher's oscillating falsetto and
the Diplo-helmed beat seduce in

lyrics, it just feels like "Missin"'
has something missing.

GEEKS GATHER
Nerd Nite concocts blend of
fun, intellect and alcohol

4

By LUCY PERKINS
Daily Arts Writer
on the evening of Feb. 21 at
The Last Word, a basement bar
on the corner of West Huron and
First Street, there were plenty of
thick-framed glasses, plaid and
cocktails. Suspended lights cast a
golden glow over a sea of thirsty
Ann Arborites as they swarmed
to the bar, waiting for the night
to begin. This was Nerd Nite, an
event proving that drinking and
being a nerd are not mutually
exclusive.
The evening began around 7
p.m. when the coordinator, or
"boss" of Nerd Nite Ann Arbor,
Liz Lamoste, gave a short history
of the organization and welcomed
over 100 guests to the monthly
event that debuted in January.
Nerd Nite started around 10
years ago in New York and has
since spread to 52 other locations
throughout the U.S. and abroad.
Self-publicized as "The Discovery
Channel (TM) with Beer!," -the
evening usually consists of three
15- to 20-minute Powerpoint pre-
sentations, with a short question-
and-answer period after each
speaker presents.
"You've got a bunch of diverse
people from all over your city
who are all interested in learning
something new," said Lamoste, a
third-year law student at the Uni-
versity. "It doesn't matter what
the presentations are about; these
are just smart people who want
to have a couple drinks and learn
somethingnew."
In mid-2012, Lamoste decided
that Nerd Nite would be a great
addition to the Ann Arbor com-
munity, so she contacted the head
bosses to start a chapter.
"I thought, 'there are a lot of
nerdy people in Ann Arbor who
would really like something like
this. Why isn't there one here?' "

Finally, Wolverines
earn first road sweep to
keep season afloat
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
COLUMBUS. - All week long,
Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson
stressed how the Wolverines wouldn't
stand much of a chance in their weekend
series with Ohio State if they couldn't
get their goals-against average down.
Though three goals Saturday were
still more than Michigan would've liked

to give up,'it found compensation from
the forwards, who led the Wolverines to
a 6-3 win over Ohio State and secured
the team's first road sweep of the sea-
son.
"You're not going to win many games
giving up three (goals)," Berenson said.
"Somehow, we found a way to score
against a team that doesn't normally
give up goals against. The puck went
in for us (and) we had some good plays.
We'll take that."
The first period brought on a slew of
goals from both sides, and it was Michi-
gan's penalty-kill unit that faltered first.
The Buckeyes quickly capitalized on a
man advantage with a wrister from the
slot to beat freshman netminder Steve

Racine glove side 30 seconds into the
power play.
But the Wolverines recovered quick-
ly, and about 20 seconds later, freshman
forward Andrew Copp found twine
from right in front of the crease. Then
Ohio State graced Michigan with an
easy scoring chance after a poor defen-
sive turnover put the puck right at fresh-
man forward Justin Selman's stick.
Down 2-1, the Buckeyes scored again
quickly after. Racine was screened and
never had a chance to see an Ohio State
slapshot rocketed from the point, knot-
ting the game at two to end the first
period.
The Wolverines continued to ride
their special teams in the second frame.

Just seconds after a Michigan power
play expired, sophomore forward Phil.
Di Giuseppe scored on a lucky bounce
that sneaked past Buckeye goaltender
Brady Hjelle. As before, though, the
Wolverines couldn't hold on to the lead
for more than a couple of minutes, and
Racine let in a soft glove-side goal to tie
the game at three.
But whereas the first period was dis-
tinguished by goal after goal, there was
a scoring drought during the latter half
of the second period.
Though they didn't find twine again,
the Buckeyes rode the momentum from
their last goal, as play stayed in Michi-
gan's zone for most of the second half
of the period. Ohio State had several

grade-Ascoringchances while the Wol-
verines struggled to maintain posses-
sion for any extended period of time.
Racine came up with some big saves
several times, though, to stop the odd-
man rushes and breakaways that char-
acterized the Buckeyes in the second

Rallying around Racine at the right time

COLUMBUS -
The desperate Michigan hockey
team traveled to Ohio State this
weekend
with a legitimate
chance at finishing
last in the CCHA,
an ugly-as-sin road
record and a goalten-
ding problem.
The Wolverines

sign of the team's first road sweep of the
season, and a prayer at hosting a playoff

- you know, the one that had all four of
the team's backstops in contention for
the starting job in the season's second-
to-last week of the regular season -
fuhgeddaboutit.
No, seriously, forget about it.
For a team that's been swamped in
uncertainty this year - injuries, a rotat-
ing presence in net, even an mid-season
defection (remember Daniel Milne?) -
it's high time for some consistency.

Any of the four netminders could've
played this weekend. Coach Red Beren-
son might as well have drawn straws.
Freshman Steve Racine was the name
Berenson settled on. And, in his first
start since Dec. 14, Racine was every-
thing the Wolverines needed him to be.
Playing behind a rejuvenated offense,
Racine didn't need to play perfectly, and
he didn't. But he was strong enough to
keep the team in the game late and didn't
collapse as the games wore on, bucking
the cripplingtrend for Michigan, at least
temporarily.

"These are tough games to play in,
especially when they're close like 3-3
going into the third, and look at (Friday)
night - 2-0 going into the third, and
even though (Racine) gave up three, he
hung in there," Berenson said. "Goalies
aren't goingto be happy with the goals
against, but nevertheless, he gave us a
chance to win.
"We gave him the goals."
The Wolverines aren't always going
to give their goalies the run support that
Racine received against Ohio State. And
Racine still gave upa couple softgoals.

But he was, at times, quite brilliant
and after his two biggest stops of the
weekend, the team seemed to get a new
life. Far too often this season, we've seen
the Michigan goalie letin a goal that
had no place beingscored, followed by a
complete breakdown of the entire team.
In the second period on Saturday, the
game changed completely when Racine
turned away a breakaway and a 3-on-1
rush to keep the game tied entering the
third period.

"I feel like Michigan has done
so much for me, might as well stay

CONNOR JAEGER: THE EXTRA LAP
The prestigious hallway is
tucked deep into the recesses of
Canham Natatorium, where only
the athletes have passage. On
the wall is a swim cap from each
Michigan swimmer who has com-
peted atnthe Olympics.
Connor Jaeger walked that
hallway every day. He recognized
the history and tradition of the
program, and he never felt wor-
thy, really.
"I came to Michigan a nobody,"
Jaeger said.
But that nobody caught fire as
a sophomore. Like much of the
men's swimming and divingteam,
Jaeger traveled to the U.S. Olym-
pic Trials in Omaha, Neb. with a
chance to race for a spot on the
Olympic roster. Jaeger, though,
knew he had a better shot than
most.
Though he swam in the 200-,
400- and 1,500-meter freestyle
events at the Trials, his true
strength was the longer distance.
He wanted to reach the final in
the 400-meter, which he did by
placing in the top eight. And he
knew that one of the members of
his training group, comprised of
Jaeger, Sean Ryan, Ryan Feeley
and Matt Patton, had a legitimate
chance at securing one of the two
spots for 1,500-meter swimmers
on the Olympic roster.
"We were all really excited
to push each other," Jaeger said.
"We looked at it as ateam goal
and a team success if we got one
of us on the team instead of think-
ing of it as four people fighting for
one or two spots."
All four swimmers qualified
for the final, but it was Jaeger -
competing in the 1,500-meter for
just the fifth time in his career -
that got the most attention. In his
preliminary heat, Jaeger tapped
the wall second, but he lost count
of his laps and continued on, mak-
ing a turn and swimming a full
50 meters before realizinghis
mistake.
In the final, Jaeger certainly
didn't lose count, and when he
tapped the wall second after 15
laps, he punched his ticket to Lon-
don. Jaeger laughed when asked
to compare the Olympics to a Big
Ten meet.
"Well, at a college meet, there
are certainly people there cheer-
ing for you and people there
cheering against vou. But at the

Olympics a lotof people justgo to
watch the spectacle.
"No one was there wanting
Connor Jaeger to fail."
And fail he didn't. Jaeger was
the only American to reach the
final, and he placed sixth, 12
seconds out of bronze-medal posi-
tion.
"You can definitely feel a sense
of failure if you don'tget the
medal," Jaeger said. "But now,
looking back in hindsight, even
though I didn'tgeta medal, I
have to be happy with my perfor-
mance."
Jaeger still walks that Canham
hallway each day. When he reach-
es the end, he sees a sign that
hangs over the double doors.
"It's not every four years," it
reads. "It's every day."
His cap isn't on the wall just
yet, but it'll be affixed there soon
enough. He's proven his worth.

BACK TO MICHIGAN
Very few athletes reach the
pinnacle of their sports before
they even graduate from col-
lege. But Caesar, Mikulak and
Jaeger did exactly that. And then
they came back to earth, back to
Michigan. Somehow, that wasn't
a letdown.
Even after competing on the
world's largest stage, they had
Michigan on their minds.
"Right before we actually left,
Sam and I were both talking how
excited we were for the upcoming
NCAA season," Caesar said. "We
barelytalked about the Olympics
leading up to it, but more about
how cool the next NCAA season
was goingto be. So far, we've been
living up to it."
- They've all lived up to it. The
three Olympians have steered
their programs to top-three
national rankings and are gear-
ing up for a post-season stretch.
Though the Olympic medals elud-
ed them, a national championship
wouldn't be a bad compromise
for now.
"I think once we made the
Olympic team it was, 'Yes, we
have this accomplishment, but
there are other accomplishments
that we want to get, some acco-
lades we need to finish,"' Mikulak
said, taking his hand fromhis
varsity jacket to gesture toward
Caesar.
"We want to win a national
championship together. Having
two Olympians, our team is no
longer as young as it once was.
We're all a lot more experienced,
and we know we're capable of
beingthe best team in this coun-
try. We want to go and prove it."
The student-athletes under-
stand the recognition and value
they've brought Michigan, too,
but they see it as repayment.
"I think that it shows people
that the program we have here
works and that hard work will pay
off," Jaeger echoed.
In the meantime, though, the
Olympians are busy, just like you
and me. It's hard to fathom, isn't
it?
"I'm still a normal engineering
student doing homework every
night," Jaeger said with a laugh,
"just like everyone else."

the floor hoping to avenge a 59-49
loss in January that snapped its
program-best 10-game winning
streak.
After getting off to a 2-1 lead,
it was all downhill from there for
Michigan as Penn State went on a
20-2 run to take a 21-4 lead.
"I think anytime you start a
game the way we started, it's
hard to come back against a top
team in the country," said Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico. "I
believe they are a top team. They
have incredible balance (and)
incredible depth. It's hard to stop
one kid because another one will
make a play."
The scoring burst from the
Lady Lions was highlighted by a
steal and pull-up 3-pointer from
Lucas at the 12:14 mark in the first
half to push the lead to double
digits. Lucas' 15 first-half points

a bonus.
For a team that's suffered its
fair share of end-of-game col-
lapses, keeping a lead and shut-
ting out the Buckeyes during
the final frame constituted one
of the best periods of hockey
Michigan has played all sea-
son. Much of that success was
due, in part, to the defensive
mindset all of the Wolverines
adopted.
"I think our forwards played
better, not only offensively,
but defensively," Guptill said.
"That's something we're going
to continue working on, the
defensive side of it, and hope-
fully the offense will keep com-
ing."
With this first road sweep
(over their rivals on their senior
night, no less) it was little won-
der the team skated off the ice
as quickly as possible at the end
of the game to rush to sing 'The
Victors'in the locker room.
"That's probably the best
weekend of Michigan hockey
we've had all year," Beren-
 son said. "(It was) a lot of little
things. Our overall team, it felt
like everybody was having a

better weekend. Had to be a
good feeling to be a player on
that team."

ble of making these plays, there's
no reason for Michigan not to
keep going back to him.
Clearly, the Wolverines need
to have one goalie to stick with
entering the CCHA playoffs, and
it needs to be Racine. Especially
when dealing with freshmen net-
minders, confidence is extremely
important and, with the rocky
start Racine and fellow freshman
Jared Rutledge got off to, they're
fragile. But the time for experi-
mentation has long since passed
- it's decision time.
I'll admit I've argued for his
benching earlier this season, but
he became the clear choice this
weekend to close out the season.
Last Wednesday, after the
team's end-of-practice shootout
dragged into extra rounds, Racine
came up with the big save and his

Senior guard Kate Thompson scored a career-high 25 points in a loss Sunday.

cent from the field and 5-for-12
from downtown, including three
from Lucas.
While Lucas' spark off the
bench contributed to Penn State's
dominance, it was the putrid
shooting from beyond the arc
and from the field in general that
doomed the Wolverines. They
shot 28.6 percent from the field in
the first half, in addition to shoot-
ing just 2-for-11 from behind the
arc.
"Golly, if you could figure it
out, help me," Barnes Arico said
regarding Michigan's slow start.
"What do you do as a coach? You
just sit there and go 'holy cow'
because there was pressure to get
the ball up the floor but I thought
our lookswere pretty good looks."
Michigan scored its fourth
point at the 15:28 mark, and its
next basket didn't come until
with 8:25 left in the first stanza on
a 3-pointer from senior forward
Kate Thompson - the team's first
made 3-pointer in nine attempts.
It was also Thompson's first made
shot in seven tries.
"Once you start missing like
that, your kids get tighter and
tighter and tighter and tighter,"
Barnes Arico said. "And tonight,
unlike the other night, we were

Di Giuseppe, while closer ta

has benefitted from being on th
same line with freshman for
ward Boo Nieves and senior for
ward Kevin Lynch this season
as he matched last season's tota
of 15 assists on Friday.
But more importantly than
their individual performance:
was the team's offensive produc
tion that benefited from the cata
lysts over the weekend.
Guptill's first goal Frida
night didn't lead to a barrage o
goals, but was key in shifting the
team's momentumwhen no team
stood above the other. On Satur
day night, Guptill used his beau
tiful dangle to spark a three-goa
third period and secure a sweep.
"Tonight we were working
hard and we got rewarded," said
teammates skated over to con-
gratulate him.
A similar scene, the Wolverines
embracing Racine, played out on
Friday and Saturday in Columbus.
Could this - what is it again?
- right, winning become a habit?
Can Racine continue to give the
team the chance to win, and can
the team respond by making sure
he gets the goals he needs?
Michigan's played eight road
games in the season's second
half, and that's precisely when

Berenson began turning the goal
over to junior Adam Janecyk and
Rutledge. Racine never had the
chance to prove he could put up a
fight on the road. He lost one and
tied one at Northern Michigan
way back in early November, and
he was in between the pipes for
another tie at Ferris State.
But after all of the terrible road
performances this team has had,
its best weekend of the season
somehow came away from home.

able to play through it and get
out of it, but I could not figure
out why we weren't makingthose
baskets early."
Despite two early fouls for
Thompson and senior guard
Jenny Ryan, Barnes Arico stayed
with the two seniors because they
were the Wolverines' only chance
to chip away at the lead. Thomp-
son delivered, leading Michigan
with 13 points at halftime, includ-
ing a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to
make the score 40-26 as the teams
headed to their locker rooms.
"(Coach) just told us to calm
down and relax," Thompson said.
"They came out of the gate really
strong so we had to come back
with our own run to finish off the
half and we cut it to 14. So we put
ourselves not in a great position
at halftime but not a horrible one
either."
Though the risky move to keep
her two foul-ridden seniors in the
game paid off - the duo didn't
pick up another first-half foul -
Penn State's lead never fell below
12 in the half.
In the second half, Thompson
finally did pick up her third foul
less thantwo minutes in, but as in
the first half, Barnes Arico stuck
with her. Once again, it paid off.
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"They weren't necessarily good
scoring chances, but we got
lucky."
h Di Giuseppe's hard work was
on display frequently, carrying
1 the puck up the ice and unself-
e ishly dishing itto a linemate. His
s unselfishness, combined with
e Guptill's persistence at the net
will be important if the Wolver-
e ines plan to sweep Ferris State
Il this weekend.
e
Guptill and Di Giuseppe also
n represented a small portion of
. the forwards' strong forecheck,
o which limited the time in their
n own zone. Their presence in the
s Ohio State zone created more
o scoring opportunities, forcing
e their rival to make a clearance to
e eliminate the pressure.
"Our forwards are still going
- hard at it," Guptill said. "And
, once the puck gets running
1 around, that's kind of what our
forecheck was built for."
In a matter of two games, the
s Wolverines' confidence shifted
- dramatically when it saw Guptill
- and Di Giuseppe make plays on
offense, or work to keep a puck
y from crossing the blue line. On
f the Buckeyes' senior night, it was
importantto have catalysts.
"We knew that it was going
- to be (Ohio State's) senior night,"
- Di Giuseppe said. "Last year was
1 very emotional for our seniors,
so we knew how much it meant
to them, and we didn't want
I them to have their way with it."
And if the Wolverines are goingto
make noise in the CCHA Tourna-
ment, they'll have to play at least
some of it, and likely all of it, away
from Yost Ice Arena.
There's momentum here, final-
ly, with Racine in net. Stick with
him, and if the offense doesn't
sputter out, there are still wins
out there for this team. There
are more post-game celebrations
around Racine left. If I'm Beren-
son, I call Racine into my office
Monday afternoon. I sit him down

and tell him the job is his and that
I believe he gives the team the
best chance to win.
I tell him to think of the team's
offensive explosion this weekend
as its way of showing him it has
his back. Then I tell him to get to
work. As Berenson said Saturday
night, you won't win many games
giving up three goals.

Thompson nailed her first two
3-pointers to cut the lead to nine,
while senior forward Nya Jordan
converted an and-1 to trim the
lead to six - the closest the Wol-
verines had been since the score
was 10-4. Michigan would make
it even closer after a 3-pointer by
senior forward Rachel Sheffer cut
the once 19-point lead to just four.
She would finish with 10 points
and six rebounds.
It was Jordan and Thompson
who led the way for the Wol-
verines, scoring 16 of their first
19-second half points. Thompson
would finish with a career-high
25 points and six rebounds while
Jordan posted a double-double
with 14 points and 10 rebounds.
"What really helped us in the
second half was that we started
making shots," Thompson said.
"Rachel made some big shots for
us (and) Nya got to the basket."
But after more than four min-
utes of silence from the Lady
Lions on the offensive end, they
recovered, scoring the next five
points to push the lead back to
nine.
From that point on, Penn
State's forwards took over, attack-
ing the rim and getting short-dis-
tance shots at their leisure as the
Lady Lions pulled away.
While Lucas got the atten-
tion for 21 points off the bench,
forward Ariel Edwards also had
11 points off the pine to help the
Lady Lions pull away late. Senior
forwards Alex Bentley and Mia
Nickson each had 11 as well.
"I thought we were able to cut
it but never get over the bump
partially due to their pressure and
playing here," Barnes Arico said.
"You can't come out of the gates
like that and expect to beat a top-
10 team.
"They got a couple good defen-
sive stops and made some plays
and we just didn't make the
plays."

Even after having an entire
week offfrompractice, itstilltook
the Michigan basketball team
more than 23 minutes of game
time to get going against Illinois
in Sunday's 71-58 victory.
Fighting off a slow start, the
game remained close until about
three minutes into the second
half, when
the Wolver- ILLINOIS 58
ines finally MICHIGAN 71
started to
look like the seventh-ranked team
in the country.
Not surprisingly, the player
who started the run that broke
the game open was point guard
Trey Burke, who became just the
seventh true sophomore in Michi-
gan history to score 1,000 career
points.
Left open about five feet behind
the 3-point line, Burke hesitated
before launching the NBA-range
trey. His hand remained in the
air until the ball was through the
hoop, givingMichiganjustits sec-
ond lead of the game.
After the Fighting Illini were
called for an offensive foul, red-
shirt junior Jordan Morgan cor-
ralled a missed 3-pointer from
freshman forward Glenn Robin-
son III and left Robinson with a
beautiful behind-the-back pass
for a massive dunk.
Illinois didn't score for almost
three minutes after Burke's long
make, falling into a nine-point
hole it couldn't pull out of. Like
so many games this season, a big
play by Burke was the kick-start
to a big run.

what it was supposed to do and
beaten Ohio in its first NCAA
Tournament game last sea-

ines.
Sunday,
the freshman
 n taeBgs s guard's six
points were
key in Michi-
gan's 71-58 win over Illinois
and LeVert's would-be coach.
The Pickerington, Ohio
native said it was "kind of
strange" playing with Groce on
the opposing sideline, adding
that he was full of "mixed feel-
ings."
But the guard didn't let that
deter his play, as he and fresh-
man point guard Spike Albrecht
contributed a handful of game-
changing plays.
LeVert played 16 minutes,
while Albrecht played just
seven. Neither of the fresh-

saying 'We've got to bring more
energy coming into the game,'
so we just tried to do that,"
LeVert said. "Most of it was
actually on the defensive end."
A few possessions after draw-
ing a charge, Albrecht knocked
down a 3-pointer to pull a slug-
gish first-half Wolverine squad
to within five points of the
Figthing Illini with eight min-
utes left in the opening stanza.
Two minutes later, the point
guard deflected an entry pass
from the perimeter that red-
shirt junior forward Jordan
Morgan stole. Morgan quickly
made an outlet pass to Albrecht,
who quarterbacked a fast break
that finished with a monstrous
slam by freshman forward
Glenn Robinson III to tie the
game.
While almost all of his play-
ing time came alongside Burke
(Burke played 39 minutes),
Albrecht looked significantly
more comfortable than he has
in previous Big Ten outings -
perhaps a product of Michigan's
recent week off.
"As we retooled this week,
we talked about that," said
Michigan coach John Beilein.
"When we saw Spike in Octo-
ber, we saw a young man that he
really saw the game at a speed
that we like him to see at.
"We know that Trey and
Tim are terrific players. There's
some other guys out there that
need to step up for us to con-
tinue in the' direction where
we want to go. Spike got a lot
of reps in practice with the first
team (in the past week)."
LeVert, who sprained his
ankle in last week's win over
Penn State, also received a
share of first-team reps after
getting healthy.
With under seven minutes
left in the game and Michigan
leading by six, LeVert deflected
a pass that led to a 3-pointer

downthe shot after he got onhis
younger teammate for passing
up a previous wide-open oppor-
tunity. It was one LeVert's two
3-pointers on the afternoon.
"I just told him, 'Just shoot
the wide-open shot,' " Burke
said. "I was so happy just
because I knew Caris was going
to hit it. I would've been mad if
he had pump-faked and tried to
go into the defense again.
"Once he just stopped think-
ing about the game and just I
playing off of natural instinct,
he hit some big shots for us, he
made some very big defensive
stops for us, and*he was a buzz
off the bench."
The two players, who both
grew up around Columbus,
have formed a special bond
that often includes-one-on-one
matchups outside of practice
time.
"They have a lot of synergy
together," Beilein said. "When
they see each other, they con-
nect. There's not a person on the
team that doesn't love Caris, so
when you have an assist to him,
it even makes you feel better."
Despite combining for just
nine points in limited playing
time, the two freshmen dis-
played maturity in a must-win
game for Michigan. And if the
Wolverines hope to make a
deep run through March and
even into early April, they'll
need contributions from their S
unsung newcomers.
"(Spike) and Caris both made
lots of extra shots this week and
it paid off," Beilein said. "We
made that commitment to the
young team early. We have some
really good players between
(senior guard) Matt (Vogrich)
and (senior forward) Blake
(McLimans), (senior guard) Eso
(Akunne), that are sitting out
right now so that these guys can
play. I was happy that we could
get that done today."

came on the other end of the floor,
back in his spot as Michigan's
defensive quarterback. Of Michi-
gan's 71 points, 43 of them came
in the second half. Morgan played
just five minutes in the first half,
but 12 in the second.
"(Morgan) reacts just a little
bit quicker than the other bigs,"
Beilein said. "Is he faster than
the other guys, is he taller, does
he block shots better? No, but he
anticipates much better than the
younger players do."
The saving grace defensively
came from turnovers. Michigan

LeVert hit a 3-pointer.
Still, even with the slow start,
it was an important win for Mich-
igan. After losing three of five so
far in February, and narrowly
beating Big Ten bottom-feeder
Penn State their last time out,
the Wolverines couldn't afford
another let down with the regular
season winding down.
"I feel like today was really
our first step of getting our confi-
dence back and getting our swag-
ger back," Morgan said. "(We are)
getting back to the basketball we
like to play."
