MNA files
grievance
against 'U'
Nurses union says
UMHS violated its
collective bargaining
agreement
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
The Michigan Nurses Asso-
ciation - a statewide union rep-
resenting University-employed
nurses - filed an unfair labor prac-
tice charge and a grievance against
the University of Michigan Health
System on June 21, allegingthe Uni-
versity violated state law and their
collective bargainingagreement.
The complaint stems from an
announcement made by UMHS in
April that stated it would alter six
nurses' schedules without negoti-
ating the changes with the union.
According to the MNA, the changes
implemented on June 25 violate
the Michigan Public Employees
Relations Act and the collective
bargaining agreement between the
University and the union.
Among the provisions, both
PERA and the contract stipulate
that hours are "mandatory subjects
of bargaining," meaning any modi-
fications to the contract's terms on
that issue must be negotiated prior
to implementation.
However, Lisa Harrison, MNA
labor relations representative,
said the University introduced the
schedule changes "unilaterally,"
without initially informing the
union of its intentions and then

Faculty reflects on
Ford's philanthropic
efforts at the 'U'
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Betty Ford, wife of the late
President Gerald R. Ford and
tireless advocate for breast can-
cer and substance abuse aware-
ness, passed away in Palm
Springs, Calif. on Friday at the
age of 93.

As news of Ford's passing
spread across campus - where
the Gerald R. Ford School of
Public Policy bears the name of
her late husband - University
officials praised her extensive
work both at the University and
beyond.
Susan Collins, dean of the
Ford School, lauded Ford as
a model for compassion and
strength and praised her ability
to empower others.
"... Speaking out in thought-
ful, balanced ways and really
making a difference on issues

that she cared about was empow-
ering to women especially, but
also to people all around the
world," Collins said. "She real-
ly was a very, very impressive
woman who was quite beloved
by all the people she met."
From being chosen to
receive an honorary Doctorate
of Laws degree from the Uni-
versity in 1976, to visiting for the
groundbreaking of Weill Hall in
November 2004, Ford had a dis-
tinguished presence on campus,

University strives to assist students
with tuition fees in light of increase

'U' considers
various factors when
admitting students
and awarding aid
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
and BRANDON SHAW
ManagingNews Editor
and Daily StaffReporter
Following the recent increase in
tuition and the release of statistics
from the Department of Education
listing the Universita as one of the
most expensive public institutions
in the nation, University officials
ensure this will not inhibit the
ability for students from all socio-
economic backgrounds to matric-
ulate at the University.
According to University spokes-
woman Kelly Cunningham, the
increase in tuition was imminent
in light of the 15-percent cut to
higher education as approved by
Republican Governor Rick Snyder.
Despite this the University will
continue to ensure fairness in the
admissions and financial aid pro-
cess for students coming from all
familial income brackets by pro-
viding increased financial aid and
opportunities to students in lower
income school districts.
While the University's net price
- the cost of tuition minus finan-
cial aid - is $16,888 compared
to the average $10,747, accord-
ing to the Department of Educa-

tion, Cunningham said students
are receiving more aid than ever
before.
The increase in aid can be
exhibited through the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents recently
approved $137 million financial
aid fund, one of the largest sums
of financial aid among public
universities in the country and
a 10.9-percent increase in Uni-
versity-funded financial aid for
the upcoming year, Cunningham
explained.
Additionally, 71 percent of
in-state students receive need-
based financial aid and those with
household incomes of less than
$80,000 pay less to attend the Uni-
versity now than they did in 2004,
Cunningham said.
In an e-mail interview last
month, Cunningham wrote the
University does its best to mitigate
the inherent barriers inhibiting
students with financial struggles
during the admissions and finan-
cial aid processes.
"(We can) state unequivocally
that (the University) does every-
thing possible to ensure accessi-
bility for all qualified and highly
motivated students," she wrote.
"The University is committed to
meet the full demonstrated need
of all admitted Michigan resi-
dents, and provides substantial
financial aid to make sure that
economic standing is not a barrier
to Michigan residents."
Cunningham added in addition
to offering aid, the University has

also invested considerable finan-
cial resources in K-12 programs
that may foster an interest in
attendingthe University.
Phillip Bowman, director of the
National Center for Institutional
Diversity at the University, said
there are vast disparities in pro-
cesses among public and private
universities regarding both high
school outreach and admissions
programs.
"Historically, private schools
have admitted students only with
many of the critiques that you
find in higher education - admit-
ting children of the wealthy,"
Bowman said. "It has become an
ongoing challenge for elite public
universities, such as the Universi-
ty of Michigan, to admit students
regardless to their economic back-
ground because of the correlation
between economic status and
preparation to college."
Bowman said students in lower
income distributions have less
access to materials and resources
during their K-12 years, which
yields a dilemma for universities
like Michigan because there is an
inherently skewed distribution
based on the lower grade point
averages and test scores common-
ly seen in statistics from students
of lower socioeconomic statuses.
Bowman, however, explained
the University has developed pro-
grams and processes to expand
the set of outreach and recruit-
ment activities to increase enthu-
siasm of attending college among

students inlower income brackets.
He added that examining
school size creates a challenge for
all admissions committees at pub-
lic universities in the country who
must give equal opportunity for
each student in the state, regard-
less of their hometown or school.
Furthermore, there are inher-
ent hindering factors, Bowman
said, because students in smaller
schools have less access to the
type of college readiness and aca-
demic preparation since smaller
schools are less likely to offer
Advanced Placement courses or
have programs that equate to its
alternative.
Nevertheless, Bowman added it
is a two-way dilemma because the
larger schools also make it harder
to compete.
"If most of these students in the
larger school have substantially
higher GPAs, then their class per-
centile is lower, and it becomes
more difficult to compare to the
smaller school," he said.
Bowman also explained there
is a growing divide and conflict
for top universities attempting to
bridge the gap between provid-
ing access to higher education and
maintaining a high level of com-
petitiveness.
"I think it is a growing crisis,
and that is because of the corre-
lation between test scores, col-
lege readiness and income and
wealth backgrounds of students,"
he said. "On the other hand, you
have a growing need to maintain
global competitiveness across this
nation."
Bowman added it is important
for institutions of higher edu-
cation to educate the growing
percentage of the economically
disenfranchised in order for the
country to remain competitive.
"The country however, I rec-
ognize, will not retain its status
as a competitive nation unless
the country is able to educate a
larger percentage of the popula-
tion," Bowman said. "Many of
whom are from middle and lower
income backgrounds who are dis-
proportionally getting access to
your more elite reasons, largely
because they don't have the same
access to public universities, but
also because they don't have the
same type of K-12 preparation."

Incoming freshman fights for U.S. citizenship

Facing deportation,
Michigan resident
voices her support of
the DREAM Act
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily Staff Reporter
For incoming LSA freshman Ola
Kaso, the amount of time she will
study at the University is uncer-
tain. The University hasn't revoked
her admission and she isn't looking
into transferring - instead her
status as an illegal immigrant in
the United States is hindering her
from pursuing a post-secondary
education.
Kaso, who is at risk of being
deported to her home country of
Albania after moving to the United
States with her mother when she
was five years old, recently tes-
tified in front of the U.S. Senate

Judiciary Committee Subcommit-
tee on Immigration, Refugees and
Border Security at a hearing on
June 28 in support of the DREAM
Act. Introduced by U.S. Senator
Carl Levin (D-Mich.), she shared
her story and appealed for the Act
to be passed.
"Despite my compliance with
the law, there is no way I can
obtain citizenship under current
law," Kaso said in her statement.
"Despite all my hard work and
contributions, I face removal from
the only country I have considered
home."
Kaso graduated from Cousino
High School in Warren, Michigan
with a 4.4 grade point average and
is hoping to follow the pre-med
track at the University in order
to eventually become a surgical
oncologist, according to her state-
ment.
The DREAM Act would allow
children of undocumented immi-
grants like Kaso to be granted

citizenship as long as they fulfill
a list of requirements, including
being between the ages of 12 and
35, either graduating from high
school, obtaining a GED in the
United States or being accepted
into a higher educational institu-
tion, as well as living in the U.S. for
at least five consecutive years.
Silvia Pedraza, professor of
sociology and American culture,
has focused much of her studies on
immigration and said that while
there are laws that allow undocu-
mented children to obtain a high
school education - since no one
in the country, regardless of sta-
tus, is denied a basic education -
the public is divided on if higher
schooling should be allowed for
those who reside in the country
illegally.
"The feelings about college are
different because people feel that
college is a privilege, that college is
something that you earn not some-
thing that you deserve," Pedraza

said. "But I have to say that in the
society in which we now live, a col-
lege degree is what a high school
degree was two generations ago: a
basic level of education that every-
body should have."
Sherrie Kossoudji, associate
professor in the School of Social
Work, said that since the Act has
been through U.S. Congress sev-
eral times, including in December
2010 when it failed to be passed to
the Senate by five votes, reintro-
ducing the Act keeps it fresh in the
public's memory. R
"It also helps to remind us that
lots of people who contribute or
hope to contribute to our society
just need a little help from us to
regularize their legal status," Kos-
soudji said.
However, Pedraza said it is diffi-
cult and rare for students like Kaso
to speak out for the Act because
it acknowledges that members of
their families are also undocu-
mented. Despite this, she said she

believes the number of students
who would be affected by the
DREAM Act is substantial.
"They want to put a human face
on it," Pedraza said. "They want
people to realize that they are stu-
dents, that they are young people,
that they are studying, that they
are doing well. That they are hav-
ing their lives and their hopes and
aspirations thwarted by not being
able to obtain a college education."
Pedraza added she is skepti-
cal about whether the Act will be
passed before the 2012 presiden-
tial election because it is a "politi-
cal hot football," which leaves an
entire year of waiting and worry-
ing for students like Kaso.
At the end of her statement,
Kaso acknowledged that a large
number of students like her would
be affected by the Act.
"There are thousands of other
Dreamers just like me," Kaso said.
"All we are asking for is a chance to
contribute to the country we love."

'U' to better prepare students

Obama instates new
plan to help students
land quality jobs after
college graduation
ByALYSSAADLER
Daily StaffReporter
As part of an initiative to pro-
tect students from inadequate
career preparation programs, the
Obama administration recently
announced a new plan that aims
to assist students in finding post-
graduate employment.
The goal of the initiative is
to ensure the "gainfu4 employ-
ment" of students who've gradu-
ated, according to a June 2 United
States Department of Education
press release, something Kerin
Borland, director of the Universi-
ty Career Center, said University
studebts already experience.
In an e-mail interview, Bor-
land wrote that while the Uni-
versity provides vast resources
for assisting students in finding
jobs, they are ultimately respon-

sible for taking advantage of their
education.
"The University provides
wonderful experiences and
strong academic programs for
our students," she wrote. "What
becomes most important for stu-
dents is how they frame those
experiences for prospective
employers, and articulate why
and how they will make contri-
butions to employing organiza-
tions."
Damian Zikakis, director of
career development at the Ross
School of Business, echoed Bor-
land's sentiment, saying he has
also witnessed many Univer-
sity students receiving jobs after
graduation. According to Zikakis,
approximately 89 percent of this
year's BBA graduates had at least
one job offer and 85 percent of
them had accepted a job by June
3.
In addition to providing addi-
tional career assistance, the new
policy aids in helping students
pay off their loans, according to
the press release.
Specifically, the plan states
that in order for universities to

qualify for federal aid in for-
profit programs and certificate
programs at non-profit and pub-
lit institutions, they must follow
three regulations: 35 percent of
former students at a given uni-
versity must be repaying their
loans, the loans owed by a stu-
dent do not exceed 30 percent
of their income and the annual
loan payment doesn't exceed 12
percent of the student's total
income.
Margaret Rodriguez, senior
associate director of the office of
Financial Aid, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the goal of the
University's need-based grant
program is to reduce the amount
of money students borrow in
order to help the most students
possible attend the University.
"The current fiscal year,
2010-2011, resulted in the larg-
est-ever amount of financial
aid in (University) history at
$126 million," Rodriguez wrote.
"Notably, 70 percent of our
undergrads receive some type of
financial aid, and families with
incomes at or below $80,000 are
paying less than in 2004."

um to see the life-sized head of a whale that lived more than 37 million years ago.

D itch the ban
Students should be allowed to smoke on campus
n July 1, and without much of a fuss, the University
campus became smoke free. Taking a page out of the
nanny state constitution, it seems that the University
believes personal choice is subordinate to the lifestyle they
want to instill in their students. With the smoking ban, the
University has created an imperious policy that infringes on
the rights of the individual. University officials have little
business instructing a person on how they indulge their lei-
sure time. If an individual wants to smoke cigarettes outdoors,
they should be allowed to. To this end, the University must
reverse the overbearing and overtly-parental smoking ban.

I grew up in a world where every-
one was forced to watch the same
news - the voices of Peter Jennings,
Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather - "The
Big Three" - almost single-handedly
shaped the nightly dinner-table con-
versation. Today we see the principle
of three networks monopolizing our
news as archaic and undemocratic
- not having the freedom to choose
sounds altogether un-American.
The fall of the news anchors -
beginning with the 2005 death of
Jennings - left the networks in flux,
causing a vacuum effect within the
media that paved the way for today's
new-media age of mass customiza-
tion and niche coverage. We sud-
denly had the freedom to choose and
customize; it wasn't the news, it was
our news. We heard what we wanted
to hear. But with our newfound free-
dom we also created a monster.
One-sided narratives took hold
and absorbing the news became an
exercise in reaffirmingand strength-
ening our pre-existing beliefs, thus
hardening our stances and views -
we created a culture of ideologues.
In support of the older model, com-
munications scholar Cass Sunstein
asserts, "gathering citizens in a sin-
gle public space" to discuss the news
actually helps democracy by stimu-
lating conversation across ideologi-
cal lines. It's now easier than ever to
filter out information that conflicts
with your particular leaning - it
takes just a click of the mouse.
John Stuart Mill once proclaimed,
"It's hardly possible to overstate the
value... of placing human beings in
contact with other persons dissimi-
lar to themselves... such communi-
cation has always been... one of the
primary sources of progress." Unfor-
tunately, when we only listen to
people who are similar to ourselves,
we each see the world with tunnel-
vision, grinding progress to a halt.
Enter the current debt crisis.
Congress must raise America's
debt ceiling by August 2 or the
Treasury will be unable to fulfill its
obligations. The Bipartisan Policy
Center says failure to raise the debt
ceiling would result in an immedi-
ate 44-percent spending cut and a
ten-percent drop in GDP along with
another recession - or we could
default on our debt. The other choice
is for our representatives to com-
promise and raise the debt ceiling.
Anyone with a brain knows what we
need to do as a country, but we've
shown we don't tolerate compromise
from our leaders.

The partisan divide and legislative
gridlock is sosevere that Standard
& Poor's downgraded U.S. credit
due to the lack of a plan for meet-
ing its financial obligations. Markets
have frozen, hiring has stopped, and
another recession could occur simply
because the leaders of the current
Republican Party care more about
preventing Obama's reelection.
Republican governor Charlie Crist
of Florida, the once highly-popular
moderate politician, was suddenly
abandoned by Republicans because
he compromised with Democrats
too often. Crist is now out of politics.
John McCain was once considered a
"maverick" before he leapt rightward
to dodge his party's recent rightward
ideological purge. As Jeffrey Fried-
man of Harvard presciently wrote
in 1999, the ability to organize infor-
mation leads to ideologues splitting
the world into good people and bad
people, and that "opponents must
be written off entirely if their ideas
are to be safely ignored." Crist and
McCain can certainly relate.
Everyone inevitably realizes the
dire consequences of not raising the
debt ceiling, whether they admit it or
not. Each of the seven times George
Bush needed it raised, sanity pre-
vailed andboth parties came togeth-
er. Whether or not to let the country
default has never been a partisan
issue - and it's sad to think of it as
such. Both parties bear responsibil-
ity to fix the problem they both cre-
ated. We must find a way to reopen
conversation across ideological and
partisan lines, at all levels.
The options today are plenty. Free-
dom to read whatever we please has
never been so great. Anyone who
wants to be heard can be heard. But
human tendency leads us to use these
freedoms in ways that simply harden
our own pre-existing beliefs, and
that's making us less sophisticated
and able-minded. Members of Con-
gress answer to their constituents,
and in a world where compromise is so
heavily exposed and penalized, hard-
line ideologywins and we all lose. We
must all turn off our niche channels
and gather in one room - one channel
- to have anhonestdebate. Ifonlythe
new-age media could lead that charge
across ideological lines the way Jen-
nings, Brokaw and Rather could.
Hopefully our narrow-mindedness
doesn't make the ceiling come crash-
ing down on us next month.
Roger Sauerhaft is a University alum.

onthe most basic level, the ban
is an infringement of personal
freedoms. People will still be able
to smoke in other places, but the
University has gone above and
beyond any state and federal law
to ban smoking outdoors while
on campus. The harm of second
hand smoke outdoors versus
other pollution, like car exhaust,
is dubious. Bylaws already in
existence allowed students to
order smokers to move away
from resident hall doors and
windows to prevent secondhand
smoke exposure. While it may be
apublic nuisance, andsmoke may
be disagreeable, there are many
things students do, like listening
to loud music, that may be irritat-
ing but shouldn't be banned from
campus. Smoking outside is sim-
ply a person enjoying themselves,
often by themselves, and it's a
travesty of individual rights for it
to be banned.

The University takes pride
and is often right to claim itself
as a bastion of liberalism and
progress. This is a campus that
produced Tom Hayden and Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society,
but somehow we've turned
this progressivism around and
started telling students how to
think and what to do, Not only
does the University tell stu-
dents that they aren't allowed
to smoke, but it hopes to encour-
age a peer regulated system to
stamp out smoking. Rather than
issuing tickets, the University
wants members of the campus
community to report smokers
to be reprimanded. This self
policing policy costs students
close to $250,000. This money
would have-been spent far bet-
ter elsewhere.
According to a June 19 Mich-
igan Daily article, 14 percent
of undergraduates smoke. And

if it were a larger cohort there
would probably be much more
backlash. Smoking has become
an unpopular activity, but that
doesn't mean we should drive
smokers away or make them
feel unwelcome. Everyone has
their vices and to stop them
simply because we think it's
in their best interests is a dan-
gerous game to play. A politi-
cal and media war has been
waged against tobacco so the
ban feels almost natural, but
such overbearing and intrusive
regulation seems unfit at the
University of Michigan. The
students at this school pay a
handsome sum to attend classes
here and to participate in this
environment. We should let
them blow off some steam, on
or off campus, and if that that's
how they choose to spend their
time and money, the University
shouldn't be saying otherwise.

When Egyptians buried their
deceased royals, they left all
kinds of tools and items behind
because they thought they
would be needed in the afterlife
- imagine if your family for-
got something. And along with
essentials like jewelry and fur-
niture, they also buried a per-
son with their organs, because
if you need your tiara in heaven
you certainly can't forget your
spleen, right? Do you think you
would die again if you didn't
have your heart when you met
Ra? I don't think this was a very
carefully crafted religion.
We can all recognize super-
stition and absurd tradition in
hindsight, but can we recognize
it happening today? Contrary to
our Egyptian ancestors, we've
realized that furniture and jew-
elry might serve the living bet-
ter than the dead, but why are
we still leaving organs with the
deceased? I imagine some of this
is done out of consideration for
the worms, but there might be a
better use for them. How about
donating them to people who are
still living, but won't be much
longer without a new spleen?
Besides the Anubis revivalists,
I bet most people think we should
donate organs upon death, but
this requires some kind of agency
on the part of an individual. I am
pretty lazy and haven't regis-
tered, just like I'm sure many of
you and people you know haven't
registered for equally legitimate
reasons. Why do we leave people's
lives up to the motivation of a
lethargic populace?
The U.S. currently uses an
opt-in system, and it would make
a lot more sense if we had an
opt-out one. Rather than hav-
ing to sign up and file a bunch of
paperwork to assert that you are
a conscious individual, we could
simply assume that humanity is
full of somewhat decent people
and have everyone on the organ
donation list. If for some reason

you think Anubis will bounce
you at the door for not having
your kidneys in the afterlife, you
can opt out of this very reason-
able policy. On the other hand,
if you are like most people,
ambivalent, or are one of the few
who take selfish pleasure in the
form of charity, you can simply
do nothing and your organs will
be donated to those who can use
them after you croak. What's not
to like?
I'll tell you. This policy may
be a good solution to our paucity
of transplantable vitalities, but
I think we can just skip all the
libertarian-pleasing foreplay for a
policy that does the most amount
of good: mandatory organ dona-
tion. I for one think it's a travesty
to allow any viable organ to go into
the ground if it could save some-
one else's life. Perhaps we could
have the illusion of an opt-out
policy so that then when some-
one tries to opt out we just take
out their organs then and there as
they aren't worthy of participating
in the human race.
But putting the manslaughter
aspect of the policy aside, what
would honestly be wrong with
society claiming organs in the
event of someone's death? The
government already takes your
income away in taxes. When
you die the government can take
money or property from your
estate, and rightly so. So why
don't we just bundle organs in
with the estate tax? Your prog-
eny can actually use the funds
from their dead relatives, but
they don't get anything out
of burying a body with all its
innards. Your loved one is going
to be maggot riddled carrion at
some point anyway, why not get
the organs out while the getting
is good? On the day you need a
new kidney, you'll have wished
you made this policy a reality.

College revan

There has been much debate
recently about the main goal of
higher education
and if universi-
ties are current-
ly achieving it.
Louis Menand, a
prominent aca-
demic and writer
of several books
on higher edu-
cation, recently ERIK
offered three TORENBERG
explanatory the-
ories in a June 6
New Yorker article.
The theories essentially respond
to the following question: What
should be the main goal of college?
Theory1: College should be meri-
tocratic.
College should provide a metric
to employers that explicitly delin-
eates the most talented and hard-
working students so employers can
hire the most talented employees.
But, as Menand notes, talent isn't so
easy to evaluate: "There is no intel-
lectual equivalent of a 10 yard dash.
An intelligent person is open mind-
ed, an outside-the-box thinker, an
effective communicator, is prudent,
self-critical, consistent and so on."
That said, a student's GPA, Menand
believes, is a fairly trustworthy
indicator of "intellectual capacity
and productive potential."
Except it isn't. GPA doesn't mea-
sure half of the skills he mentioned
above. And, by omission, practices
such as outside-the-box think-
ing, self-exploration and effective
communication are actually dis-
couraged. College should be merito-
cratic, but our current GPA system
doesn't reward the skills most cru-
cial to success. Creating metrics
that incentivize such skills will
become increasingly more impor-
tant.
Theory 2: College should be dem-
ocratic.
Menand first claims that college
should enlighten and empower stu-
dents by exposing them to mate-
rial that they will not encounter
otherwise. He then claims that the


main goal of theory 2 is for "high-
er education to be available to all
Americans." These aren't mutually
exclusive, but increasing accessibil-
ity means that the barrier of entry
has to be lowered, which can nega-
tively affect the quality of students.
Aiming to develop an enlightened
citizenry and aiming to have a dem-
ocratic one isn't exactly the same
thing. As Menand elaborates, it's
apparent Theory 2 is about wider
accessibility, not improved quality.
Theory 3: College should serve
our economic interests.
"Advanced economies demand
specialized skills, and since high
school is aimed at the general learn-
er, college is where people can be
taught what they need in order to
enter a vocation."
There are acouple problemswith
such an approach. First, economies
change. Jobs exist now that didn't
exist 10 years ago. Second, recent
studies suggest thatstudents in spe-
cialized schools aren't developing
critical thinkingskills.
So Theory 1 (meritocratic)
doesn't do what it's designed to
do; GPA doesn't measure the skills
most important to success. Theory
2 (democratic) isn't enough by itself;
if the quality of education is so low,
who cares if it's widely accessible?
And Theory 3 (economic) is coun-
ter-intuitive; economies demand
new skills over time, so some spe-
cialties may not even be necessary.
In the age of Peter Thiel Uncol-
lege, a website that is trying to
reboot the collegiate system, when
the cost of college is rising and the
web is facilitating cheaper alterna-
tives, universities need to reinvent
themselves. This calls for a new
theory, one that will reconcile and
encompass elements from the other
three approaches.
Theory 4: College should pro-
mote personal growth of individu-
als with the intent to cultivate an
enlightened citizenry.
In NYU Professor Jeffrey
Arum's book "Academically Adrift"
he stated that students aren't learn-
ing enough during college. There

is debate over the validity of his
study, but what hasn't been debat-
ed - and what the validity of the
study depends on - is whether we
have a shared understanding of
what learning is and what students
should be learning. Arum's tests
focused on analytical reasoning,
problem solving, and clear commu-
nication.
But what about creativity? A
Newsweek article claimed that it's
the #1 sought after skill in the busi-
ness world.
Universities
need to reinvent
themselves.
What about our self-knowledge?
It's tremendously important that
we understand how our narratives
- biological and cultural - have
affected us, and that we have the
ability to reflect and change habits.
What about our ability to empa-
thize, connect with and lead others?
David Brooks claimed that "master-
ing these arduous skills is at the
very essence of achievemen.t"
An enlightened citizenry has
not only mastered its ability to
reason, but it has also mastered
its emotions. Theory 4 will stress
self-knowledge, social intelligence,
independence in thought and action
with the intent to change students'
dispositions. It will aim to influ-
ence how they think, not what they
think.
Perhaps Theory 4 will guide
universities of the future. Menand
would be happy to see students
questioningthe importance of what
they are doing. He wonders if stu-
dents are still asking those often
negatively received - but all too
important - tough questions.

Rackham dean receives prestigious and personal award

Dean Stewart
receives honor for
research on women
and psychology
By HALEY GOLDBERG
For the Daily
In front of about 1,100 mem-
bers of the American Association
of University Women, Abby Stew-
art, associate dean of Rackham
Graduate School, received the
Eleanor Roosevelt Fund Award at
the AAUW's 2011 National Con-
vention in Washington, D.C. on
June 18.
The Eleanor Roosevelt Fund
Award, which was established
in 1989, provided Stewart with
$5,000 and honored her psycho-
FORD
From Page 1
Coleman said in a July 8 School of
Public Policy press release.
"Betty Ford was a gracious
and generous friend of the Uni-
versity, as well as a warm personal
friend," Coleman said. "She was a
wonderful partner with her hus-
band, the late President Gerald R.
Ford, and together with their chil-
dren they were steadfast support-
ers of Michigan. We will miss her
dedication and enthusiasm, and
will remember the affection she
showed our community."
Alongside her husband, Betty
Ford co-chaired the Michigan
Difference campaign and helped
raise money forcthe construction
of the Ford School, Collins said,
adding, "she was very generous
with her time" and always met
with students, faculty and staff.
Even following President
Ford's death on December 26,
2006, the former first lady
remained involved with the
affairs of the University, even
meeting with Collins at her home
in California after she was named
dean of the Ford School in 2007.
"She very graciously spent
some time with me and a staff
member hearing about what was
happening at the school," Collins
said. "She was very interested in
me as the dean and my interests
and direction for the school. It
was a wonderful visit."

logical research of women and
work toward women's rights. In
addition to ties between her moth-
er and the former first lady, Stew-
art wrote in an e-mail interview
that she embarked upon women's
studies because she felt it was a
neglected area within psychology.
"At the time when I entered
the field of psychology, the expe-
riences women had were not
studied much and were not con-
sidered an important part of the
mainstream of the field," Stewart
wrote. "I wanted to contribute to
changing that."
Stewart wrote that she was
flattered by receiving an award
that provided a "symbolic linkage
with such an important vision-
ary female leader," particularly
because the connection stems
from her mother's work with Elea-
nor Roosevelt during World War
Collins added that Ford's work
with women's rights would be one
of her most lasting impacts.
"For all of the things she has
done in the rights of women ... she
was just a force and made a tre-
mendous impression at that time
that I think has really been quite
lasting," Collins said. "She was
an active supporter for the Equal
Rights Amendment, and that was
quite controversial at that time, as
were a number of the positions she
took."
David Horrocks, supervisory
archivist for the Gerald R. Ford
Presidential Library and Museum,
said the source of her dedication
to the University spurred mostly
from President Ford - a student
and celebrated player for the foot-
ball team in the early 1930s.
Elaine Didier, Gerald R. Ford
Library and Museum director,
echoed Horrocks' sentiment and
said that Ford eagerly supported
her husband's initiatives for the
University.
"The University was primarily
President Ford's love," Didler said.
"He went to school here, he was
the football star, he came back
repeatedly ... he was very proud
of the Ford School being built. But
certainly she was right there with
him."
In addition to her work with
the University, Ford also publicly
struggled with both cancer and
substance abuse. After being diag-
nosed with breast cancer in 1974,
she openly discussed the issue

II in garneringsupport for the war
effort.
According to Stewart, the
extent of the relationship had
been unknown until her mother's
death two years ago, when Stew-
art's son contacted the Roosevelt's
Hyde Park archives to search for
materials relating to Stewart's
mother. Stewart wrote that she
was surprised to receive 72 pages
of documents pertaining to her
mother's work as a volunteer and
then a paid assistant to the former
first lady.
"My mother had always mini-
mized her connection with Mrs.
Roosevelt, while at the same
time emphasizing how much she
admired and respected her," Stew-
art wrote. "So it was a great gift to
have these papers and learn more
about my mother's life as a young
woman during the war."
with the public, a decision Col-
lins said resulted in "changing
the comfort level of talking about
what had been a very taboo and
private subject."
Ford also spoke openly about
her addiction to prescription
drugs and alcohol in the years fol-
lowing her battle with breast can-
cer. After her family confronted
her about her prescription drug
and alcohol use, Ford entered
the Long Beach Naval Hospital
in California in 1978. Once she
fully recovered, she founded the
Betty Ford Center at the Eisen-
hower Medical Center in Rancho
Mirage, Calif. in 1982 to provide
resources for people struggling
with substance abuse.
The facility - regarded today
as one of the premier addiction
centers in the world - will be
another of Ford's most outstand-
ing impacts, Collins said.
"(It is) a model for how you
address addiction to alcohol and
drugs and how you support and
treat both the men and women
who are addicted but also their
families," she said.
Horrocks said this candor is
what people admired most about
Ford, and is a quality that made
it easy for Americans to identify
with her. He added that even at
her most vulnerable, she appeared
both poised and genuine.
"I think she really was what
she appeared to be to the public,
by which I mean a kind and genu-
ine person," he said.

"I know my mother would
have been truly delighted by this
symbolic connection tying the
three of us together... that made
this award feel very personally
meaningful to me," Stewart added.
Stewart wrote that Roosevelt
has continually inspired her in her
personal research pursuits and
studies of women's rights.
"There is no doubt that Elea-
nor Roosevelt was an advocate for
women's rights, and more gener-
ally for human rights and social
justice," Stewart wrote. "It is her
commitment to these values that
inspired my mother, me, and so
many others."
David Engelke, associate dean
of the Rackham Graduate School,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
Stewart's colleagues were glad
to hear news of her winning the
award, though many of them

passing over the MNA's subse-
quent demands to bargain.
In early April, the six nurses
- who are part of a forty-member
vascular access services team spe-
cializing in infusion therapy and
IV placement - were told some of
their shifts would be reduced to
eight hours from the usual twelve
hours, Harrison said. Those nurs-
es then approached the union
with a complaint, and the MNA
pledged to look into the situation,
she added.
By April 19, the MNA had sub-
mitted a demand to bargain with
the University, but were "unre-
sponsive" to the demand accord-
ing to Harrison, and throughout
May and June either ignored or
refused the MNA's efforts to nego-
tiate.
"I was actively working to
basically avoid filing a charge,"
Harrison said. "And because of
unresponsiveness or lack of will-
ingness, that didn't happen ...
We had no choice but to file the
charge."
John Karebian, MNA's execu-
tive director, said in a June 30
press statement that the Univer-
sity Health System's inattention
was indicative of the University's
treatment of its nurses.
"This behavior by the Employ-
er is a sad commentary on the lack
of respect the nurses receive,"

anticipated it would happen.
"All of us at Rackham were
very pleased, though not par-
ticularly surprised she would
win such an award since she is
known across campus, and across
the nation, for her advocacy and
scholarship on relevant issues,"
Engelke wrote.
Engelke added Stewart has
been a "prime mover" in helping
to raise awareness of difficulties
faced by both women and minor-
ity groups on campus.
Linda Hallman, AAUW exec-
utive director, stated in a June 6
press release that the organiza-
tion was excited to honor Stew-
art because of her extensive work
with women and psychology.
"We are proud to celebrate
the achievements and work of Dr.
Stewart, a champion of equity for
women and girls," she said.
Karebian said. "The University
of Michigan Professional Nurses
Council is made up of well-edu-
cated registered nurses who are
the backbone of quality care at this
health system. They deserve better
treatment from their Employer."
In response to ongoing con--.
tract discussions between the
University and the MNA, the
University Health Service wrote
in a June 29 press statement that
they respect the work of nurses
"as they play a crucial role in the
quality and safety ofthe care (pro-
vided) at UHS."
This week, University offi-
cials declined to comment on the
charges brought by the MNA, but
Michael Steigmeyer, UMHS inter-
nal communications coordinator,
confirmed in an e-mail interview
that UMHS is looking into the
allegations.
"We have received the claim
and are following our usual pro-
cess for reviewing and responding
to it," Steigmeyer wrote.
The charge will now head to a
formal hearing during which the
University and the MNA will offer
arguments and present witnesses
for examination and cross-exam-
ination in a trial-like proceeding,
according to Ruthanne Okun,
director of the Michigan Employ-
ment Relations Commission. After
the hearing, which concludes a
process that typically lasts six
months, a judge will issue a deci-
sion and recommend an order, she
added.

Failing grade for
'Bad Teacher'

By ANKUR SOHONI
Daily Arts Writer
When you make a "bad" movie,
you better damn well make it good.
Look at "Super-
bad" - once the
easiest potential
target of clev- Bad Teacher
erly disparaging
newspaper head- At Quality16
lines ("'Super- and Rave
bad' is super bad,
folks"), and think Columbia
of the discus-
sions that likely went on between
filmmakers and studio execs before
titling the film. "Superbad" turned
out to be great, and it had to be in
order to avoid otherwise inevitable
embarrassment.
The people over at Sony and
Columbia should be kicking them-
selves for titling Cameron Diaz's
latest starrer "Bad Teacher," as in
poetic fashion, itseems fromincep-
tion to have been nothing but bad,
bad, bad.
Directed by Jake Kasdan ("Walk
Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"),
Detroit native and son of 'U' alum
Lawrence Kasdan, the film follows
middle school teacher Elizabeth
Halsey (Diaz, "Knight and Day")
whose primary goal in life - aside
from seemingly belittling her stu-
dents and alienating literally every
single person she meets - isto find
a super-rich guy with whom to set-
tle down.
To that end, she courts straight-
laced and baby-faced substi-
tute teacher Scott Delacorte
(Justin Timberlake, "The Social
Network"), coincidentally full of

money from his family's watch-
brand empire. Working against
her is wacky teacher Amy Squir-
rel (Lucy Punch, "Take Me Home
Tonight"), who quickly starts to
win over the heir due to - at least
in Halsey's limited comprehension
- her must more sizable breasts.
So Halsey finds the answer and
we find our protagonist's concoct-
ed narrative drive: She must get an
inconveniently expensive breast
augmentation, for which she must
now raise money.
Not as super
as 'Superbad.'
While "Bad Teacher" has a
pointless and dully handled prem-
ise, its greatest failure is its inabil-
ity to make its characters, and
especially its protagonist, worth
rooting for. Keeping a movie audi-
ence engaged is a matter of keeping
them sympathetic with the charac-
ters'goals, and the unlikeable char-
acters of "Bad Teacher" do little to 0
inspire sympathy or caring.
Cameron Diaz has more talent
than she gets credit for, but when
she accepts roles like the lead in

Warped Tour shakes punk up

National tour stops in the 'D,' catering beyond
the skater, alternative-music scene
By Timothy Rabb I Daily Arts Writer

Iq

Every summer, a throng of die-
hard music-lovers converge in the
parking lot of Comerica Park in
Detroit for the Vans Warped Tour.
The day long music festival - dedi-
cated to the music and mayhem that
typifies skate culture - draws a
crowd of surprisingly diverse char-
acters ranging from adolescents to
adults, scenesters to hipsters and
goths to straight-edge punks.
If this year's crowd proves any-
thing, it's that the ideals of ado-
lescent rebellion, solidarity and
outright zaniness that gave life to
Warped in the mid-'90s are still
alive and well. A sea of black t-shirts
mill to and fro between nine stages,
each declaring its wearer's vulgar,
tongue-in-cheek philosophy.
"F*** you, I'm fat," announces
the shirt of a stout, thirty-some-
thing concertgoer. "My feet hurt ...
from kicking so much ass," declares
another.
These brazen attitudes aren't
just shared by the Warped fans,
but by the musicians they worship.
A screamed introduction thunders
through the air to kick off the first
band playing the tour's Advent
Clothingstage, one ofninesoapbox-
es scattered across the ballpark lot.
"We are a sucky band, and I am a
miserable human being!" announc-
es the lead singer, who avoids men-
tioning his band's name and instead
cuts straight to the chase.
"Everybody raise your middle
fingers in the air," he demands.
Once he's satisfied that at least half
the crowd is complying, he cracks
a sinister smile. "Now, that's what
I call a sea of 'f***-yous!' " At that,
* the fans' screams dissolve amidst a

rollicking hardcore breakdown, the
moshing commences and random
objects sail through the air like dol-
lar bills at a strip club.
Unlike the fickle, gimmicky com-
mentary that accompanies most
live performances, the singer's
words sound unusually sincere.
That's because the Warped Tour
faithful aren't here to live vicari-
ously through the bands. Often, the
lives of the bands, their fans and the
other Warped attendees are one
and the same, rooted in the rabid
fan culture of skateboarding.
Just ask Pipinnetti, a teen who
came all the way from Albuquerque,
N.M. to compete in the Vans Skate
Amateur Mini-Ramp Skate Jam, a
competition that gives young trick
skaters the chance to prove them-
selves on a small half-pipe, driven
by the encouragement of their light-
footed comrades and the attention
of a smattering of passersby.
"I didn't come here for the
bands," said the beater-clad teen in
a matter-of-fact monotone. "I came
up here to skate, for a chance to go
to Hollywood."
Nearby, a beardy, brawny
Warped representative sits in
a metal folding chair, intently
watching every ollie, grind and
kick-flip. His name is Brent, and
he explains that he's sitting in at
every tour stop to judge the ability
of each and every would-be Tony
Hawk. At each stop the top skat-
ers are declared finalists and win
prizes ranging from shoes to small
cash rewards. The best from the
entire tour are flown to California
to skate at a larger event for a mon-
etary prize and the publicity that

as gym teacher Russel Gettis, but
his performance is little more than
phoned in. He nonetheless deliv-
ers some of the film's most comedic
moments, including one in which

they hope will turn their dreams
into careers.
Many of Warped Tour's veteran
acts have memories - at once fond
and painful - of their time as aspir-
ing skaters, when their dreams were
as profound as those of Pippinetti.
"My music career was made at a
time in my life when I was squatting
with a bunch of other skaters in an
abandoned house called The Blue
Room," said Scott Russo - front-
man of the punk rock act Unwrit-
ten Law - in an interview with
The Michigan Daily. "My whole life
revolved around doing drugs and
trying to be a professional skater."
Russo, whose band produced
the chart-climbing singles "Save
Me (Wake Up Call)" and "Seein'
Red," is an intriguing combination
of roughneck and fragile. Clutching
an oversized plastic vaporizer ciga-
rette in one hand and an umbrella in
the other, he speaks with an under-
tone of restlessness in his voice.
When asked why he's chosen to
weather the hardships of a broken
home, a lifelong battle with drug
abuse and countless creative differ-
ences (his band has released six stu-
dio albums, released by almost as

sary R rating, the comedy becomes

some glorious sound design) and
F-bombs for F-bombs' sake.

many different labels), his response
is as pointed as Pippinetti's.
"No matter what we do as a
band, I always feel like something's
incomplete," Russo said. "I can't
stop until I finish what I started."
The resilience that carried
Unwritten Law through 20 years of
trials and tribulations is a welcome
mantra at this year's Warped Tour,
especially in an era of the dwindling
record sales figures.
But as mainstream music adapts
to the advent of bigger and better
technologies, the bands at Warped
Tour adapt with it. In an attempt
to mitigate the decreased interest
in punk rock purism, Warped has
taken on more and more genre-
bending bands in recent years -
this year's lineup included plenty.
A noteworthy example is the
metalcore group Attack Attack!
from Westerville, Ohio. Their set
features the choppy, distorted
guitars and double-bass drums of
metal coupled with healthy doses of
techno and Autotune.
Bands like Attack Attack!

R-rated comedies are often
praised for their uncompromising
creativity, as were "The 40-Year-
Old Virgin," "Bridesmaids," and
that other "bad" movie, "Superbad."
"Bad Teacher" is not to be included
in such a bunch, as the raunchiness
seems no more than tacked on.
"Bad Teacher" is bad (and the
lack of creativity in such a sentence
is nothing but reflective of how
uninspiring the film truly is). While

the contemporary influences of hip
hop and electronica. In addition to
the ska, pop-punk and rock tradi-
tion of Warped Tour and the trendy
hip hop/electronic crossover bands
of recent years, Warped went a
step further by including several
straight rap and dubstep acts in this
year's line-up, many of whom per-
formed on a local stage tailored spe-
cificallyto the Detroit music scene.
"This is my first year," said Neva-
dan rapper Big B in an interview
with The Michigan Daily. "We're
not your average Warped Tour
band, so it was awesome that we not
only got invited out here, but drew a
big crowd of kids."
Featuring a variety of musicians
is one of the ways Warped Tour has
broadened its audience base over
the years when its grown from a
fledgling tour with barely fifteen
bands in 1995 to a festival-sized
attraction with over a 100 live acts *
and numerous tents catering to an
eclectic amalgam of techies, met-
alheads, charitable donors, skaters,
cyberpunks and about every other
subculture one might imagine to
exist. Who ever said punk rock was
dead?
such badness could be somewhat
redeemed by a general sense of pur-
pose in the finished product or at
least a good effort from the leads,
the film falls far short of either. By
the end of the story - a story struc-
tured around the unfinished and
unrewarding arcs of a poorly devel-
oped cast of characters - there is
little to take away. "Bad Teacher"
has nothing to teach, and plenty to ns
learn.

'M' matches fierce competition in Montreal

Five swimmers rack
up seven medals in
Canada Cup
By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
For the Michigan swimming'
team, it wasn't supposed to go this
well at the Canada Cup in Mon-
treal, Quebec.
The Wolverines were supposed
to be nervous and somewhat
intimidated.
Sure, a few of them were sup-
posed to swim well, but the major-
ity of them were supposed to be
content with just competing with
some of the world's best swim-
mers.
This was just supposed to be
an opportunity for them to gain
invaluable experience at the inter-
national level. But for the 21 Wol-
verines that made the trip, they
did more than just soak in the
experience.
They showed that they
belonged.

Whitten takes the reins after excelling as assistant

Son of former PGA
Tour veteran ready
for new challenge
By SAMANTHA PEARSON
For the Daily
It's been just two weeks since
Chris Whitten was promoted to
head coach of the Michigan men's
golf team, but he already has his
blueprint in motion for the future
of the Wolverines.
Already busy searching for the
best and brightest golf recruits in
the nation, the enthusiastic and
optimistic Whitten plans to estab-
lish a squad that will continue the
long line of success with Michi-
gan men's golf for many years to
come.
The Wolverines have finished
in the top-10 at the NCAA Tour-
a nament twice in the past three
years, both times under the direc-

tion of former head coach Andrew
Sapp and Whitten as an assistant.
Whitten has aspirations to sur-
pass this previous success and
build a program that will one day
bring home a national champion-
ship.
And Whitten is no stranger to
the high caliber level of elite golf.
His father, Buddy Whitten,
played on the PGA Tour through-
out most of his son's childhood,
with the younger Whitten often
being a caddy for his father.
Chris Whitten, a Rockford,
Mich. native, brought his golf
skills to Notre Dame, where he
played all four years. He earned
the Fighting Irish's Varsity
Monogram Award and the Knute
Rockne Scholar Athlete Award in
2002.
It was there in South Bend,
Ind. that he discovered his love
for teaching, and turned down
the opportunity of a professional
career for himself.

the legacy of previous male golf-
ers from that area.
"Matt has been here for a lot of
Michigan's golf success," Whit-
ten said, "And I look forward to
watching him keep the winning
tradition alive."
In addition to Whitten's tal-
ented crew of eight already onS
the squad, he is looking to add
an assistant coach to the team as
well. According to Whitten, inter-
views are still taking place to fill
the assistant coaching vacancy at
Michigan.
Once Whitten gets his 20110
roter finalized, don't expect any
drop-off in production under the
untested head coach.
Whitten's no greenhorn - he's
seen the best of collegiate and
professional golf - and now he's
ready to lead the Wolverines.

King earns on-the-job training at Davis Cup

Tennis sensation
helps Roddick, Davis
Cup team prepare
By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
After a week of practicing with
the United States Davis Cup team
down in Austin, Texas, sophomore
Evan King could muster up just
three words that could describe his
experience.
"It's been unbelievable," King
said.
Selected as a practice player to
help the team prepare for its match
against Spain during the Davis Cup
quarterfinals, which ran July 8-10,
King spent the last nine days down
in Austin practicing with Ameri-
ca's best tennis players: Andy Rod-
dick, Mardy Fish, Bob Bryan and
Mike Bryan.
King, who ended the season
as the No. 17 ranked player in the
nation, finished with a singles
record of 30-9 and a doubles mark
of 20-14.
