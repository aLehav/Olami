ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

At about 4:15 p.m. Tuesday, 
12 people traveled to U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell’s Dearborn office 
to continue protests to urge 
Dingell to sign the Green New 
Deal. They were met with police 
blocking them from entering the 
building.
After occupying U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell’s, D-Ann Arbor, 
Ypsilanti 
office 
for 
nearly 
24 hours this past weekend, 
Sunrise Movement Ann Arbor 
activists continue to attempt 
sit-ins as they urge Dingell to 
sign the Green New Deal. About 
15 protesters hoping to stage 
another sit-in showed up to 
her office in Ypsilanti, Monday 

afternoon to find it closed for 
the week. 
Sunrise Movement Ann Arbor 
has been pressuring Dingell to 
sponsor the Green New Deal 
— legislation fighting climate 
change and economic inequality 
— since February. Dingell has 
not been present at any of the 
previous sit-ins staged by the 
group in April, September, or 
this past week, when three 
activists were arrested after 
refusing to leave her office. 
After finding Dingell’s Ypsilanti 
office closed on Monday, the 
group posted a Facebook event 
advertising their plans to stage 
an “office takeover” at Dingell’s 
Dearborn office. 
Although Sunrise activists 
were not allowed to enter the 

building, they stood outside, 
sang and recorded statements 
urging Dingell to respond to 
their 
repeated 
attempts 
to 
convince her to sign the Green 
New Deal. 
Naina 
Agrawal-Hardin, 
Sunrise hub coordinator and 
Washtenaw International High 
School student, referenced the 
UN’s most recent Emissions 
Gap Report, which compares 
projected 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions for 2030 to the goals 
of the Paris Agreement.
“We have to treat this crisis 
with the urgency it deserves,” 
Agrawal-Hardin 
said. 
“Just 
today, 
the 
United 
Nations 
released a new report stating 
that if we don’t seriously get our 
act together, then it’s over for 

us.”
Allie 
Lindstrom, 
Sunrise 
activist 
and 
Washington 
University in St. Louis senior, 
urged for action beyond the 
100% 
Clean 
Economy 
Act 
Dingell introduced on Friday, 
which sets 2050 as a goal for an 
economy which produces net 
zero pollution. 
“It’s not enough just to do the 
bare minimum and to set 2050 
as a deadline,” Lindstrom said. 
“We have to make substantive 
changes to our economy so 
that it fights for our lives, 
and it fights inequality, and it 
addresses the ways in which we 
are experiencing climate change 
here in Michigan.”

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Department 
of 
Nuclear 
Engineering 
and 
Radiological Sciences and the 
Energy Institute partnered 
with a D.C.-based research 
institute, the Energy Impact 
Center, to create the first 
inaugural energy competition.
The competition is called 
the Nuclear Energy Grand 
Challenge and is open to all 
students. Co-director Todd 
Allen, who is the chair and a 
professor in NERS, said one 
objective of the competition 
is to create a space for 
interdisciplinary learning.
“A 
lot 
of 
Engineering 
students 
work 
on 
their 
engineering degree and don’t 
get enough interactions with 
people 
from 
the 
Business 
School or people from the 
School of Public Policy,” Allen 
said. “I’m hoping that another 
thing we do is help with 
that connectivity in a way 
that it makes the students’ 
educational 
experience 
impactful.”
The 
competition 
began 
on Sept. 27 with a series of 
workshops 
hosted 
by 
the 
Center for Entrepreneurship.

Earlier 
this 
month, 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 
Department 
debuted 
a 
new website to serve as a 
centralized hub for data on 
the health of county residents. 
The Health For All Washtenaw 
website features information 
from nine different census 
locations about approximately 
250 different topics, including 
demographics, mental health, 
poverty and public safety.
In a Nov. 18 press release, 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 
Department Communications 
Coordinator Kayla Steinberg 
explained the purpose of the 
website and how it is meant to 
benefit the community. 
“Healthforallwashtenaw.
org is a central location for 
information, 
stories 
and 
action items on what impacts 
our health,” Steinberg said. 
“Think of it as an online health 
record for all of Washtenaw 
County.”
In each set of data, users 
are able to compare the data of 
the county to that of the entire 
state of Michigan, as well as 
the country. They can also see 
how the measurements have 
changed in the location over 
time.

After a decade of serving 
students and Ann Arbor 
locals, South U Pizza is 
shutting its doors for good in 
mid-December. Located at 
1110 S. University Ave., the 
local eatery has been a pizza 
staple since opening in 2009. 
South U Pizza, along with 
several other businesses on the 
block, will be replaced with 
new luxury student housing, 
known as Vic Village South. 
Manager 
of 
South 
U 
Pizza 
Karim 
Ghussani 
explained the developer, 
Hughes 
Properties, 
is 
planning on tearing down 
South U Pizza along with 
most of the block to build 
the new high rise. 
“The 
main 
reason 
is 
because the building is going 
to be torn down to put a high 
rise instead there,” Ghussani 
said. “That company, the Vic 
Village company … they’re 
going to tear down the whole 
block, and they’re going to 
build another high rise.”
Hughes 
Properties 
has 
already begun advertising 
the new development just 

steps 
from 
campus 
as 
luxury student housing. The 
same company completed 
construction of Vic Village 
North 
earlier 
this 
year. 
The apartment complex is 
located directly across the 
street from South U Pizza, 
and will be 12 stories tall 
with over 57 apartments and 
261 beds. 
In a previous Daily article, 
Sean Havera, vice president 
of construction at Hughes 
Properties, spoke about the 
addition of Vic Village North 
and soon to be Vic Village 
South on South University 
Ave. 
“When you look at the area 
where Vic Village North is at 
and where Vic Village South 
is at, those are probably the 
best student housing locations 
anywhere 
in 
downtown,” 
Havera said. “So, the projects 
will actually complement each 
other.”
As a result of this new 
development, other businesses 
including 
Underground 
Printing, PNC Bank and Oasis 
Grill will be relocating or 
closing. 

About 30 people attended a 
local event Tuesday titled “What 
is Queer Fashion? Millennials, 
Gen 
Z, 
and 
Gender 
Equal 
Clothing” at the Ann Arbor 
District 
Library. 
The 
event 
focused on a push for an increase 
in inclusivity within the fashion 
industry.
Abby Sugar, CEO of Play 
Out Apparel, LLC, a company 
centered around creating gender 

equal underwear and athleisure, 
began by speaking about what 
the words “fashion” and “queer” 
mean both technically and in 
terms of the fashion industry.
According to Sugar, “queer” 
means “something that breaks 
heteronormative 
assumptions 
of gender and sexuality and 
challenges and redefine gender 
binaries 
and 
traditional 
expressions 
of 
masculinity 
and femininity.” She defines 
“fashion” as “the intersection of 
commerce, social and cultural 

expectations with the expression 
of individual identity.”
However, in the context of 
the industry, these terms have a 
much more realizable meaning, 
Sugar said.
“When we’re talking about 
queer fashion, we’re talking 
about how the multiplicities of 
gender and the multiplicities of 
gender identity are performed 
through fashion and clothing, 
and also how LGBTQ designers 
are bringing their point of view 
to fashion,” Sugar said.

Sugar continued to discuss 
how 
fashion 
is 
a 
way 
of 
expressing oneself. She said even 
if society does not identify as 
“fashionable,” the clothes worn 
and the styles embodied are 
very indicative of personalities 
and 
perceptions 
of 
oneself. 
She 
explained 
how 
clothes 
not only communicate mood 
and perspective to others, but 
also express social and gender 
expressions.

The Association of Public 
Land-Grant Universities’ 2019 
innovation 
and 
economic 
prosperity award was awarded 
to the First Customer and 
Small 
Company 
Innovation 
programs. Both initiatives are 
part of the The University of 
Michigan’s Economic Growth 
Institute. Since 2013, this award 
has commemorated exemplary 
leadership and innovation in the 
fields of entrepreneurship and 
technological economic growth. 
Both 
programs 
aim 
to 
meet the diverse needs of 
startups and small businesses 
in 
Michigan 
by 
creating 
jobs, 
bringing 
products 
to 
market and capitalizing on 
the 
University’s 
academic 
resources to provide research 
and educational opportunities. 

The 
Economic 
Growth 
Institute 
more 
generally 
aims to better the Michigan 
economy by providing services 
and allocating resources to all 
market levels. 
Vikesh 
Chandrashekar, 
project manager of the First 
Customer program, said the 
Economic 
Growth 
Institute 
improves 
the 
Michigan 
economy 
by 
engaging 
and 
supporting 
the 
many 
contributing entities.
“The 
economic 
growth 
institute, the way I like to 
describe it, is an outward 
facing 
institute 
at 
the 
University where we work with 
regional companies and try to 
bolster the economy that way,” 
Chandrashekar said. “There’s 
three facets of our engagement. 
One is through working with 
manufacturing 
companies, 
another one is working with 

technology 
ventures 
and 
entrepreneurs and the third is 
doing research that guides this 
kind of work as well.”
Chandrashekar also spoke 
on the specific purpose of the 
First Customer project as a 

major 
supporter 
of 
the 
technology 
economy 
in 
Michigan, helping to bring 
new company’s products to 
market in the most efficient 
and successful way. 
“We 
work 
with 
technology 
companies 
in helping them get their 
customers,” Chandrashekar 
said. “Technology ventures 
here 
in 
Michigan 
are 
heavy in technical talent, 
but where they might be 
lacking is in their sales 
and marketing capability… 
We’re trying to provide 
them assistance, connect 
them 
to 
the 
resources 
in the state in terms of 
consultants.”
Mary 
McCardwell, 
project 
manager 
of 
the 
Small Company Innovation 

program, said the goal of this 
project has been to develop 
and support small businesses 
and entrepreneurs with the 
necessary resources by forming 
partnerships with Michigan’s 
15 public universities.
“We 
want 
to 
support 
innovation… a lot of innovation 
comes from small business, a 
lot of jobs are created by small 
business,” McCardwell said. 
“This particular program was 
for 
those 
small 
businesses 
specifically 
that 
were 
commercializing tech.”
Paula 
Sorrell, 
director 
of 
the 
Economic 
Growth 
Institute, said the programs 
were initiated in response to 
a statewide demand for jobs 
and 
economic 
revitalization 
following a recession seven 
years ago.
“The 
state 
needed 
to 
diversify the economy — so 
much of it was heavily reliant 
on the automotive industry and 
really the universities were 
such a huge asset for the state 
to be able to leverage those 
into helping small companies 
and to helping get innovative 
companies launched,” Sorrell 
said. “That was why it was 
really important to create it in 
the first place.” 
LSA 
sophomore 
Joshua 
Burg, a political science and 
economics major, shared his 
thoughts on the importance of 
cross University collaboration 
and the high educational value 
for everyone involved in such 
an opportunity.
“I think fostering cooperation 
between universities is one 
of the key aspects of being in 
a university,” Burg said. “It’s 
how we can first of all learn… 
by working together towards a 
common goal and that common 
goal being altruistic, we can 
both follow a moral mission 
while also furthering our own 
experiences 
and 
knowledge 
within economics.”

University stands by women in slander suit

Nov. 24, 1987
The 
University’s 
executive 
officers 
yesterday reaffirmed their 
support for two women 
being 
sued 
for 
slander 
by 
a 
visiting 
professor 
in what has become a 
landmark case testing the 
University’s 
commitment 
to its five-year old “Tell 
Someone” program. 
The 
program 
was 
designed 
to 
encourage 
victims 
of 
sexual 
harassment 
to 
report 
incidents. 
However, 
this is the first time a 

complaintants’ charge has 
been challenged with a 
slander suit, and University 
officials decided to offer 
legal aid. The slander suit 
stemmed from a student 
who 
charged 
that 
she 
was sexually assaulted by 
Dutch author and writer-
in-residence 
Thomas 
Rosenboom in September. 
Rosenboom 
filed 
a 
defamation 
suit 
against 
the woman as well as 
University Sexual Assault 
Counselor Kata Issari. 
Rosenboom 
said 
the 
women slandered him by 

telephoning 
Germanic 
Languages 
Department 
chair Robert Kyes, his boss. 
Rosenboom will stand trial 
for fourth degree criminal 
sexual conduct December 
21. 
He would not comment 
on 
the 
case. 
Although 
University 
officials 
promised legal aid to the 
student and counselor, on 
Friday 
the’ 
University’s 
Board of Regents called 
for a review, prompted 
by Regent Neil Nielsen’s 
(R-Brighton) concern about 
high legal costs and the 

University’s responsibility 
to provide legal aid in 
“private litigation.” 
Students, faculty, staff, 
and community members 
protested 
the 
review 
saying 
the 
University’s 
“Tell Someone” program 
would be worthless if the 
University did not “stand 
behind” it with legal aid. 
University 
President 
Harold 
Shapiro 
stymied 
protestor’s 
fears 
by 
reaffirming 
the 
University’s 
commitment 
to 
victims 
of 
sexual 
harassment. 

“While we are studying 
the matter, as the Regents 
have 
requested, 
the 
University will continue 
to 
observe 
the 
present 
practice which is to defend 
employees who may come 
under legal attack as a 
result of the performance 
of their duties or following 
existing policy such as the 
‘Tell Someone’ program. 
“I want to emphasize 
that 
the 
University 
remains fully committed 
to combatting racial and 
sexual 
harassment 
and 
to 
the 
‘Tell 
Someone’ 

program,” Shapiro said in 
a press release. 
The 
regents 
can, 
however, 
overturn 
a 
decision 
made 
by 
the 
executive officers. While 
Shapiro met with executive 
officers 
behind 
locked 
doors 
early 
yesterday 
morning 
to 
review 
the 
decision 
to 
represent 
the 
women, 
about 
30 
University 
protestors 
pounded 
on 
doors 
and 
chanted 
against 
the 
regents’ review request.

After defining important 
and frequently misunderstood 
terms 
including 
sexual 
orientation 
and 
gender 
identity 
and 
expression, 
Sugar discussed the growing 
global awareness of inclusive 
fashion. 
“We’re seeing a lot of 
mainstream, 
high-fashion 
designers 
on 
the 
runway, 
designing for gender-equal 
clothing and non-gendered 
styles,” 
Sugar 
said. 
“This 
is important because … if 
we’re seeing the opening up 
of gender expression, and if 
we’re seeing non-gendered 
clothing styles on the runway, 
eventually those are going to 
be passed down because of 
influencers.”
Sugar 
showed 
a 
video 
portraying the 2018 runway 
show 
from 
the 
Brooklyn 
Museum, hosted by dapperQ, 
a queer fashion magazine that 

inspires all people to think 
uniquely about queer fashion 
as beauty and art. In this 
video, models defined what 
queer fashion meant to them 
and set trends that would 
spread awareness about queer 
fashion on a broader scale. 
Sugar also talked about 
prominent existing designer 
lines such as Virgil Abloh’s 
Off-White luxury line. The 
designers were focused on 
not only creating LGBTQ 
inclusiveness, 
but 
also 
inclusiveness for race, gender, 
ability and size.
Finally, 
Sugar 
discussed 
her own company, Play Out 
Apparel, 
a 
company 
that 
provides multiple styles of 
underwear, 
anatomically 
adjusted for both males and 
females. They create prints 
that will be equally available 
for any gender and style of 
underwear or athleisure.
“I started this company 
because I wasn’t able to find 
clothing that affirmed my 
gender identity or gender 
expression,” 
Sugar 
said. 

“Underwear, when I started 
this company years ago, was 
extremely gendered. Every 
color should be in every single 
cut or style available.” 
Stacy 
Miller-Bond, 
a 
marketing manager at Spark 
Foundry, spoke to The Daily 
about her high hopes for 
growing inclusivity in the 
fashion industry after the 
event.
“I think overall, my hope is 
that (the fashion industry) is 
always inclusive, and not just 
inclusive of a specific look or 
of a specific group of people,” 
Miller said. “(In terms of) 
intersectionality, it was not 
always inclusive of people 
of color … but I definitely 
feel like it’s moving there. In 
the presentation itself, just 
in the choices of imagery, 
there weren’t just stick-thin 
models, 
white 
models 
or 
Black models. It was a little 
bit of everyone which made it 
feel more at home, and that’s 
how I feel fashion and queer 
fashion should be.”

Oasis 
Grill 
will 
be 
moving into the previous 
location of China Gate, 
another South U. eatery 
that closed recently. 
“Because the lease is not 
expired yet for the Oasis, 
they gave him the other 
location there and I think 
the Oasis Grill is going to 
move on Jan. 7 over there,” 
Ghussani said. 
Ghussani also explained 
South U Pizza would not be 
relocating after December.
“He’s not going to open 
any more because it says 
South U Pizza, it should be 
on the South U, and there’s 
no more locations on South 
U,” Ghussani said. “There’s 
a lot of customers that are 
really, really sad, they have 
customers from a long time 
ago.”
Many students know the 
restaurant as a quick and 
easy pizza stop. Business 
junior 
Jaylen 
Burch 
explained South U is his 
choice for a pre-class meal.
“Before class, if I just 
want a little bite to eat 

since this looks probably 
cheap and inexpensive, I’ll 
come grab a slice here,” 
Burch said.
LSA 
junior 
Laura 
Sanderson expressed her 
disappointment since her 
usual stop between classes 
would be closing down. 
She bemoaned the loss of 
South U’s many creative 
pizza flavors.
“I’m 
disappointed. 
I don’t know how long 
they’ve been here, but I’ve 
seen plenty of businesses in 
Ann Arbor open and close 
within 
a 
few 
months,” 
Sanderson said. “But it 
does make me sad, because 
now, where am I going to 
go for my mac and cheese 
pizza and what not?”
Sanderson 
also 
elaborated on her concern 
for 
the 
replacement 
of 
local 
restaurants 
with 
apartment complexes and 
its effect on student life. 
“I 
mean, 
there’s 
the 
whole argument that Ann 
Arbor 
does 
need 
more 
housing, 
hopefully 
that 
more supply is supposed 
to 
drive 
the 
price 
of 
housing down, but I don’t 
know that’s really going 

to 
happen,” 
Sanderson 
said. “If South U is just 
apartment 
complexes, 
then it’s not going to be a 
popular place to hang out 
anymore.”
In the past year, many 
of Ann Arbor’s small local 
businesses 
have 
closed 
down, 
and 
the 
large 
number of developments 
like 
those 
already 
and 
soon to be on South U. 
may be linked to this. 
South U Pizza employee 
Felipe Lopez said he has 
experience with working 
at businesses which have 
closed in Ann Arbor. 
“I mean, this is normal, 
you know? I used to work 
in other places, and they 
closed,” Lopez said. 
Ghussani also shared his 
thoughts on the real estate 
developers that will build 
another high rise where a 
cohort of local businesses 
sits right now. 
“They 
have 
money, 
they’re 
going 
to 
do 
whatever they’re going to 
do,” Ghussani said. 

Steven Wilson, associate 
director of the institute, 
said 
their 
approach 
towards fostering economic 
innovation is particularly 
unique, as each business’ 
needs 
are 
different 
and 
the 
institute 
responds 
accordingly.
“We don’t have a canned 
approach, we don’t have a 
basket of goods that solve 
your 
problem,” 
Wilson 
said. “We don’t come to 
the table with anything to 
sell. We’re always looking 
for the right thing for that 

company, regardless if that’s 
in our camp or in some other 
university’s camp… we have 
projects going on at the 15 
other 
public 
universities 
because it was a better fit, it 
was the right thing to do.”
Wilson 
also 
reflected 
on what it means for the 
institute 
to 
have 
won 
the award and why the 
University 
stands 
out 
nationally. 
“Why our university over 
all others in the nation won 
the innovation award, was if 
you look at other ecosystems 
around the country, some 
of them have more gaps 
than others and I think in 
our ecosystem we fill those 

critical gaps,” Wilson said. 
Sorrell said the programs’ 
state funding is to be cut 
and that they will be ending 
shortly, but the institute will 
continue to serve Michigan’s 
businesses in different and 
evolving capacities. 
“These two programs, we 
were notified the same week 
that we won the award that 
they were being cancelled 
by the state. It’s unfortunate 
because 
they’ve 
been 
running 
for 
seven 
years 
now,” Sorrell said. “We’re 
always looking to build on 
the skill sets that we have 
and the success that we’ve 
created.”

Allen said the optional 
workshops introduce the idea 
of nuclear waste, help students 
get a better understanding of 
entrepreneurship and foster 
interactions between possible 
teammates. 
Engineering 
senior 
Mackenzie 
Warwick, 
a 
participant 
in 
the 
competition, said about 30 
people are participating in 
the competition and about 10 
people attend each workshop.
Warwick said she pitched 
the idea of a prize competition 
to Allen during the summer, 
which led Allen to collaborate 
with Energy Impact Center’s 
Managing 
Director, 
Bret 
Kugelmass.
Warwick said her team is 
working on a project that uses 
radiation from used nuclear 
fuel to decompose plastics 
for hydrogen, alternative fuel 
production and hydrocarbon 
base chains.
“I’m so excited,” Warwick 
said. “Anything about nuclear 
excites me, and so I think 
it’s a cool way to kind of get 
everybody 
in 
the 
college 
thinking about things.”
Since 
an 
important 
aspect of the competition is 
interdisciplinary 
teamwork, 
Warwick said her team is 
made of a diverse group 
of students. However, she 
mentioned 
she’s 
the 
only 
NERS student in the group, 
which makes it frustrating to 
explain concepts at times. She 
said the competition provides 
a low stress environment that 
allows her to work on these 
skills.
“With a very specific set 
of people with the same 
mindset, being able to convey 
what you want and know 
technically 
to 
someone 
who has no experience is a 
challenge,” 
Warwick 
said. 
“It’s very helpful because 
now I have to see how other 
people are thinking about the 
competition and interpreting 
the information.”
Kugelmass said the most 
important 
aspect 
of 
the 
competition is to create a 
new narrative around nuclear 

waste.
“They 
are 
tasked 
with 
reimagining nuclear waste,” 
Kugelmass said. “The idea is 
to come up with ideas of how 
nuclear waste can productize 
so you change something 
that once was thought of as 
dangerous and a liability, and 
by giving it economic value, 
you change the perception.”
Allen 
agreed 
with 
Kugelmass saying this is an 
important opportunity to get 
people talking about nuclear 
waste and come up with a 
technological solution that 
changes the way people think 
about the issue.
“The 
most 
optimistic 
innovation 
would 
be 
we 
come up with something that 
actually changes the national 
narrative on nuclear waste,” 
Allen said.
Warwick 
said 
she 
got 
interested in nuclear energy 
after the Fukushima accident 
occurred in 2011. She said 
she 
hopes 
disasters 
like 
Fukushima 
and 
Chernobyl 
don’t happen again.
“I hope that these are 
some very good initial steps 
into getting the status quo of 
nuclear to be a more positive 
outlook,” Warwick said. “A 
lot of the people who refute 
nuclear use Chernobyl or 
Fukushima as examples.”
The organizers also formed 
a group of advisers who are 
experts in nuclear energy 
and 
entrepreneurship 
to 
help students develop their 
ideas. Allen said participants 
will 
have 
an 
opportunity 
to enroll in a Center for 
Entrepreneurship course to 
receive academic credit for 
their work.
The 
technological 
innovation portion of the 
competition 
will 
officially 
begin in the winter semester 
when the teams are finalized 
and will conclude with teams 
pitching their ideas to a 
panel of judges on April 9. 
The winning team will win 
$17,000.
Kugelmass said the prize 
money will help incentivize 
students, and could be thought 
of as an investment in a future 
company that may be created 
out of the competition.
“We’re hoping that some of 
these students become very 

encouraged and really get 
the momentum going that 
they’ll turn their projects into 
real life products, perhaps 
through 
entrepreneurship,” 
Kugelmass said.
Kugelmass said the new 
innovations could lead to 
a more positive outlook on 
nuclear energy, which could 
be useful in reducing carbon 
emissions in the future.
“This is one step towards 
making nuclear more publicly 
favorable,” Kugelmass said. 
“Nuclear energy as a whole as 
it increases in share will have 
dramatic effects on reduction 
of carbon dioxide emissions. 
This is one way to popularize 
nuclear energy.”
Allen echoed this thought, 
saying 
the 
competition 
may provide initial steps to 
move toward zero carbon 
emissions. 
“If our prize comes up with a 
different pathway that makes 
people more comfortable with 
nuclear 
technologies, 
that 
will be important for moving 
towards zero carbon,” Allen 
said. “I also think it helps 
more people understand just 
what nuclear waste means. I 
think that’s helpful, because 
it is informative and allows 
people to better understand 
the conversation.”
Kugelmass said he hopes 
to 
partner 
with 
more 
universities and organizations 
in the future.
“The 
University 
of 
Michigan is a real leader in 
a lot of areas,” Kugelmass 
said. “They’re definitely a 
pioneer with us in the first of 
these nuclear energy grand 
challenges, but there’ll be 
many more to come.”
Warwick said she hopes 
to participate in other prize 
competitions in the future 
and would like to see her 
project come to life one day. 
She hopes people become 
more informed through the 
project.
“I think it’s just a fear of 
the unknown and the fact 
that (nuclear energy) was 
originally 
used 
for 
war, 
and it wasn’t a peaceful 
application,” Warwick said. “I 
think if anybody is interested 
in nuclear, just look at the 
many options it could be used 
for.”

In some cases, the webpage 
for certain topics includes a 
section explaining to the user 
why the data are important.
In order to make the data 
more accessible, the website 
includes the option for users 
to build their own customized 
dashboard or view premade 
community 
dashboards, 
focusing on a specific location 
or topic. It also has options for 
colorblind users and a video 
about how to best use the 
website.
Once on a dashboard, users 
are able to see more specific 
information for each topic 
and subtopic of data. A variety 
of icons show how the data 
compares to other locations, 
whether the levels met the 
target goal and how they 
have changed from the prior 
value. Some of the data are 
also categorized into a green, 
yellow or red level based on 
a comparison with 500 U.S. 
cities. 
Washtenaw County Health 
Department 
Performance 
Improvement Manager Lily 
Guzmán 
discussed 
how 
the 
Health 
Department 
hopes the website will make 
information more accessible 
for community members. 
“We recognized that there 
is so much data out there,” 
Guzmán said. “What we really 
liked the idea of was having 
more of a central location 
where folks in our community 
can come to one central place, 
know it’s a trusted source and 
get all their data needs met at 
one time.” 
Based on this measure, 
Ann Arbor is in the red zone 
for adults who binge drink, 
homeownership, 
median 
household gross rent, people 

living 
below 
the 
poverty 
level and households without 
a 
vehicle, 
among 
other 
categories. 
Guzman 
also 
discussed 
how Ann Arbor is in a unique 
situation for data collection, 
as it is one of the 500 largest 
cities in the United States. She 
also explained why the large 
student population does not 
skew the data when compared 
to these other cities. 
“There are some specific 
indicators 
that 
are 
only 
available on the Ann Arbor 
level,” Guzman said. “That 
is because Ann Arbor is one 
of the largest 500 cities in 
the country, and so there are 
some special indicators on 
the website that only Ann 
Arbor has because there is an 
extra data source for them. 
I’m sure some of the other 
largest 500 cities also have 
large universities in them, so 
I would imagine there is some 
comparability 
with 
other 
communities.” 
Aubree McMahon, Public 
Health senior and president 
of 
the 
Public 
Health 
Association, 
commented 
on how University students 
interested in public health 
can use this new information 
to improve problems faced by 
the community. 
“As 
students 
at 
the 
University of Michigan, we 
have heightened access to 
people with resources that 
can 
make 
a 
difference,” 
McMahon 
said. 
“Making 
your voice heard on ways the 
University should give back to 
… the community and talking 
to local and state legislators 
for this area are some ways 
to draw attention to these 
issues. (You can also) use the 
new website to find programs 
where you can volunteer your 
time, resources and talents.”
In addition to data, the 

website also houses various 
resources 
for 
community 
members, 
including 
funding 
opportunities 
for 
public health projects and 
a 
community 
calendar 
of 
events. It also includes the 
ability to build a customized 
report to download or share 
with others. 
Public 
Health 
junior 
Maxwell Ryner is the liaison 
to the School of Public Health 
for CURIS, a public health 
advocacy 
organization. 
He 
discussed 
why 
the 
accessibility 
of 
data 
and 
resources is important and 
how it could be used for public 
health projects to help the Ann 
Arbor community, specifically 
with homelessness. 
“I 
personally 
believe 
that 
the 
information 
being 
accessible 
to 
the 
public is crucial in getting 
conversations started,” Ryner 
said. 
“(Especially 
when) 
addressing 
the 
problem 
of 
homelessness 
in 
our 
communities. There is far 
too much stigma surrounding 
public 
misconceptions 
regarding homelessness and 
is often a conversation most 
shy away from. Having this 
information available to the 
public would be beneficial to 
public awareness.” 
The creation of Health for 
All Washtenaw comes after 
a steering committee was 
created earlier this year — 
composed of ten community 
members, four organizations 
and two hospitals — to improve 
public health conditions and 
bring attention to related 
issues. 
The 
committee 
is 
part of a national model for 
improving 
public 
health 
through community planning 
known 
as 
Mobilizing 
for 
Action through Planning and 
Partnerships.

Maggie Rousseau, Dingell’s 
deputy 
chief 
of 
staff 
and 
communications director, gave 
a 
statement 
regarding 
the police presence on 
Tuesday.
“When the event was 
posted 
on 
Facebook, 
the 
Dearborn 
Police 
communicated 
to 
our 
office that protests are 
not 
allowed 
without 
proper permits, and the 
building manager when 
alerted gave us written 
notice that no protests 
are allowed inside the 
building,” the statement 
said. “Dingell and her 
staff strive to be good 
tenants in the space we 
lease to continue serving 
the people of the 12th 
Congressional 
District 
with critical services such 
as help with Veterans and 
Social Security benefits.”
The 
statement 
also 
included 
an 
explanation 
of 
Dingell’s absence. 
“Dingell 
returned 
to 
Washington, 
DC 
Tuesday 
to perform the Pro Forma 
sessions of Congress over the 
Thanksgiving holiday – a part of 
her elected duties as a Member 

of Congress,” the statement 
continued. “She was very clear 
with staff and Dearborn police 
that she respects this group 
working very hard on this 
issue. Dingell strives to build 
coalitions – making friends, not 

enemies – to achieve goals and 
takes that seriously.”
Agrawal-Hardin 
expressed 
her dissatisfaction with what 
she sees as Dingell’s continued 
lack of direct response to those 
promoting the Green New Deal. 
“A lot of my friends and my 

parent’s friends are quick to 
remind me — knowing that 
we’re running this campaign 
trying to get Congresswoman 
Dingell to cosponsor the Green 
New Deal — that she is a really 
fantastic representative and a 
really fantastic advocate 
and to be honest, I think 
that’s true,” Agrawal-
Hardin said. “But that’s 
not been the way that 
she’s treated us young 
constituents who have 
peacefully 
protested 
her inaction on climate 
change … She hasn’t 
made us feel like she 
wants to hear what we 
have to say.”
Lindstrom 
said 
she feels she needs to 
continue demonstrating 
to make change. 
“I don’t think she 
seriously 
started 
considering things until 
we started popping up 
everywhere,” Lindstrom 
said. “I think it takes 
flooding 
the 
office 
with constituent calls, 
and occasionally with people, 
to get her attention. But her 
constituents 
should 
always 
matter, and her constituents 
shouldn’t have to organize like 
this for her to take our lives 
seriously.”

“We have to make

our economy so that

Why are men so obsessed with their daughters’ virginity?

SOLOMON MEDINTZ | COLUMN

U-M has $1 billion invested in fossil fuels. Let PCNN talk about it

30 years on, has German reunification hit a wall?

R

ecently, 
musician 
and 
singer T.I. went on a 
podcast called Ladies Like 
Us on Nov. 5, and boasted about how 
his daughter’s hymen is still intact, 
and he knows because he forcibly 
takes her to the gynecologist. Here’s 
why that is problematic, and frankly, 
sickening. 
When Deyjah, T.I.’s daughter, 
turned 16, her father posted a 
note on the fridge stating they 
would be attending the doctor’s 
office within the next few days. 
When I first heard this story, I 
was straining to be optimistic, 
hoping this would be a case of 
teaching children and teens about 
sexual wellness and awareness 
by taking the time to familiarize 
them 
with 
their 
reproductive 
health resources. Instead, Deyjah’s 
father 
is 
inherently 
obsessed 
with maintaining his daughter’s 
socially-constructed 
purity 
and 
her virginity. Every year since she 
turned 18, he’s been driving her to 
the gynecologist as a post-birthday 
tradition. 
The 
American 
College 
of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
recommends that girls first see a 
gynecologist between the ages of 
13 and 15, with a yearly checkup 
every year post initial exam. 
However, if reproductive health 
and overall health are maintained 
smoothly, there may not be a need 
to attend a specialized branch of 
medicine like the gynecologist. 
Many women’s health needs can 
be fulfilled by a primary care 
provider or even on the third floor 
of University Health Services 
at the University of Michigan, 
the Women’s Health Clinic. The 
Women’s Health Clinic provides 
comprehensive care for patients of 
any gender, and any patient seeking 
gynecologic 
information, 
STI 
treatment or post-sexual assault 
services can surely find some 
degree of help on the third floor. 
Granted, if the financial resources 
are available, it can be important 
to have a gynecologist. However, 
due to the potentially invasive 
nature of medical procedures 
or practices, gynecology visits 
can be intimidating. Some of 
the top reasons people make a 
gynecologist appointment are for 
overall physical health check-ups, 
pregnancy-related visits, irregular 
menstruation, breast or pelvic 
exams, pap smears, birth control, 
etc. Even then, the idea of making 
an appointment or going to the 
gynecologist is intimidating. 

For this reason, gynecologists 
and other medical professionals 
tend to stress the importance 
of not performing unnecessary 
procedures. 
One 
of 
these 
unnecessary medical procedures 
is a virginity assessment, or 
hymen check. There is no factual, 
scientific or medical basis for 
determining 
whether 
or 
not 
someone has experienced vaginal 
penetration, and therefore has “lost 
their virginity.” In cultures where 
female virginity is prized, many 
women and girls are subjected to 
these invasive examinations in 
order to ensure that they are still 
“pure.” In addition to there being 
no scientific or medical evidence 
of virginity, these examinations 
can 
be 
psychologically 
and 
even physically harmful to girls 
and women. Examinations are 
oftentimes done without proper 
patient consent, normally when 
the patient is coerced into the 
procedure by an elder family 
member or even a partner. 
It is the physician’s job to ensure 
patient safety and not violate 
commonplace HIPAA guidelines. 
When the physician seeing T.I.’s 
daughter attempted to get her 
consent for the procedure with 
her father knowing the results, 
the exchange was frighteningly 
forceful. T.I. stated, “Is there 
anything you would not want 
me to know? Oh, OK. See doc? 
No problem.” Madeline Brewer, 
an actress on “The Handmaid’s 
Tale”, tweeted, “This makes me 
feel physically ill. It’s abhorrent 
… The level of toxicity and malice 
and control he’s exerting on his 
own daughters (sic) life and bodily 
autonomy and privacy. I’m sick.” 
T.I. was then informed again that 
there are other ways to tear the 
hymen, such as riding a bike or 
horse, running on the playground, 
playing sports, etc. Furthermore, 
sometimes people can be born 
without a hymen entirely — so 
the presence or absence of this 
thin piece of mucosal tissue is not 
indicative of one’s virginity. Each 
person is different. Presented with 
this information, T.I. promptly 
responded, “Look, doc, she don’t 
ride no horses, she don’t ride no 
bike, she don’t play no sports. 
Man, just check the hymen please 
and give me back my results 
expeditiously.” You can notice in 
T.I.’s language that he objectifies 
his daughter by saying “the 
hymen” and “my results,” not a 
single mention of his daughter or 

the control she should have over 
her own body. 
If virginity is not measured on 
a factual nor medical basis, what 
is it? First, virginity is strictly a 
heteronormative concept based 
on the first episode of vaginally 
penetrative sex, which excludes 
anyone who does not participate 
in 
heterosexual 
intercourse. 
It’s a social construct that was 
ultimately manifested to control 
women and to make them feel 
bad about being sexually active. 
This ideal is ingrained in religion 
and cultures around the world 
and is almost always harmful to 
women and girls. From the time 
we are young girls, we are told 
that if we do not “wait for the 
right man” or “save ourselves for 
marriage,” we are committing 
a sin, or we are ruined or we 
are not worthy. This certainly 
led to the patriarchal double 
standard where it’s perfectly 
fine, even encouraged, for boys 
to lose their virginity and gain 
sexual experience, but girls who 
are sexually active are considered 
damaged, ruined, used or slutty by 
the exact same standards. Why is 
something so different to everyone 
— this thin mucosal tissue that can 
be compared to an earlobe — so 
important in determining a young 
woman’s worth? 
T.I.’s 
behavior 
towards 
his 
daughter 
and 
her 
body 
is 
possessive, 
sickening 
and 
controlling. He is deeply invading 
her privacy by making her attend 
the gynecologist with him, but 
the fact that he also went on a 
podcast to talk about it showcases 
his gross sexism and misogyny 
toward women and, ultimately, 
his own daughter. T.I. is obsessed 
with saving his daughter, but from 
what? This idea of psychologically 
manipulating and ruining his 
daughter to “save” her from an 
evolutionarily 
and 
physically 
normal process is profoundly 
disconcerting. What’s even more 
frightening is the possible reaction 
when and if he learns that his 
daughter’s hymen is, for whatever 
reason, not intact. T.I.’s daughter 
is not his property, nor is any other 
human being. Young women are 
fully capable of making their own 
informed choices about their bodies 
and their sexuality and certainly do 
not need to have their sexualities or 
bodies policed.

his month, November 2019, 
marks the 30th anniversary 
of the fall of the Berlin 
Wall, one of the most momentous 
events of the 20th century. In many 
regards, the German reunification 
was an unbridled success: After 
being divided for more than four 
decades, the nation was able to come 
together quickly and peacefully, 
bridging major divides. On the 
surface, this reunification appears to 
be a miraculous success story. Since 
1990, all of Germany has cheered for 
the same national soccer team, used 
the same currency and operated 
politically as one united nation. 
However, below the surface, 
there are many signs that Germany’s 
seemingly 
smooth 
reunification 
process failed to address significant 
political, social and economic divides 
between the former East and West 
states. In recent years, increasing 
political polarization and rising 
cultural tensions have highlighted 
this problem, and in order to move 
forward, Germany and the world at 
large must critically re-evaluate the 
successes and failures of reunification.
Currently, 
the 
most 
obvious 
concern for Germany is the large-scale 
inequality that still exists between 
the affluent former West and the 
comparatively less well-off former 
East. Though the gap has shrunk in 
absolute terms since 1990, at which 
point the former East produced only 
8 percent of Germany’s GDP, a large 
chasm still exists. Today, Germany’s 
six poorest states (measured in GDP 
per capita) are the six that formerly 
composed East Germany. 
Furthermore, 
the 
disparity 
between disposable incomes in 
the former East and West states 
has 
actually 
increased 
since 
reunification. In 1991, former East 
Germans averaged 61 percent of what 
West Germans made in disposable 
income. Today, that difference has 
increased. Unsurprisingly, people 
from both the former West and 
East believe the two regions still 
have unequal living conditions — 

66 percent from the West and 74 
percent from the East. 
Though the German government 
has 
poured 
money 
into 
the 
former East since reunification, 
it has not been able to effectively 
bridge the economic gap between 
Germany’s two regions. In the years 
immediately 
after 
reunification, 
the German government used the 
poorer former East as a testing 
ground for new neoliberal policies. 
Unfortunately, this experiment did 
not promote increased economic 
growth in the former East to the 
degree many had hoped for. Today, 
only 7 percent of Germany’s 500 
biggest companies are based in 
the East. Historically, the most 

effective method of overcoming 
Germany’s economic chasm has 
been direct state expenditure into 
the former East in the form of 
solidarity payments, but these were 
largely used in the years immediately 
following reunification, and are not 
a particularly sustainable way to 
develop the East. It is imperative that 
Germany finds a way to address this 
wealth gap, since it ties into nearly all 
of the other divisions that exist today. 
A major cultural wedge still 
exists between the former East and 
West, which has been highlighted 
and worsened in recent years, most 
particularly by an influx of refugees 
and migrants into Germany. This 
divide, which is descended from a 
larger debate on what constitutes 
being “German,” is in part derived 
from Germany’s history of “jus 
sanguinis” 
inherited 
citizenship 

policy, which prioritizes German 
ancestry — not German residency 
— in determining national status. 
This ideology was thrust into 
the spotlight after the fall of 
communism, particularly after a 
number of Russians with German 
ancestry were granted citizenship, 
while ethnically Turkish German 
residents, who lived exclusively in 
the former West, were not. In 2000, 
Germany finally adopted a more 
modern citizenship system, but the 
sentiment that citizenship should be 
tied to ethnic background still exists, 
particularly in the former East. 
This internal conflict was again 
reinvigorated when Germany began 
accepting large numbers of refugees 
in the early 2010s. Today, the six 
states composing the former East 
have far fewer migrants than the rest 
of Germany and are categorically 
less supportive of Germany’s liberal 
immigration policies. Though the 
former West’s prevailing sentiment 
is that Germany should present 
itself as a bulwark of liberalism, this 
view is not particularly popular 
in the former East. Instead, many 
Germans in the former East 
believe 
refugees 
and 
migrants 
are dangerous and should not be 
welcomed. In many ways, this belief 
is rooted in Germany’s geographic 
inequalities: Many residents of 
the former East think they have 
received insufficient support from 
the modern German government 
and feel it is unfair that Germany 
devotes energy and resources 
to resettling migrants as they 
continue to suffer. Considering 
Germany’s 
political 
systems, 
institutions and parties descend 
from the former West, the former 
West’s outsize population gives 
it more electoral influence — 
hence why the former East feels 
somewhat put-upon.

A major cultural 
wedge still exists 
between the former 
East and West

A 

couple 
weeks 
ago, 
my 
colleague Timothy Spurlin 
wrote 
a 
great 
article 
explaining why fossil fuel divestment 
is necessary and why the University 
of Michigan should divest. He is 
right, but I want to go over some 
of the logistical barriers that are 
preventing U-M from divesting. 
In the column, Spurlin says that 
divesting is complicated. He’s not 
wrong that the process of divestment 
would be difficult, but President 
Mark Schlissel could take the clear 
and obvious first step of letting the 
President’s Commission on Carbon 
Neutrality discuss divestment. 
On Oct. 4, 2018, President Schissel 
created the PCCN. He charged the 
commission to recommend a path 
for the University to achieve carbon 
neutrality and to contribute to a 
“sustainable and just world.” While 
the commission’s charge is nominally 
ambitious, it is also contradictory; 
the PCCN was created to get the 
University to carbon neutrality, but 
it cannot engage with some of our 
biggest sources of carbon, including 
the expansion of the Central 
Power Plant and investments in 
fossil fuels. Schlissel has explicitly 
banned 
the 
commission 
from 
discussing these issues. This ban 
is especially egregious because the 
University has at least $1 billion of 
its endowment invested in fossil 
fuels extraction. And that number 
is rapidly increasing. Our tuition 
money is directly bankrolling the 
very industry creating the climate 
crisis. Refusing to even discuss the 
possibility of extricating U-M money 
from the fossil fuel industry means 
the University, even if it achieves 
carbon neutrality on its campuses, 
will continue footing the bill for the 
extraction and burning of fossil fuel 
around the globe. For this reason, 
Schlissel should let the commission 
discuss divestment. 
How do we know the University 
has $1 billion invested in fossil 
fuels? Of the University’s $12.4 
billion endowment, 8.2 percent 
of that money is devoted to 
“Natural Resources,” which brings 
the total to over $1 billion. The 
University is somewhat secretive 
about where the money from its 
endowment is going. We only have 
access to the most recent years of 
investments, but here are some of 
the highlights: In April 2018, the 
University invested $75 million 
into Kayne Private Energy Income 
Fund II, L.P., a natural resources 
private equity fund that “will take 
advantage of increased long-term 
demand for natural gas … and … will 
acquire large, long-life gas assets.” 
They also committed $50 million to 
PetroCap Partners III, L.P. to invest 
in “strong operators in oil and gas 
projects.” 
The University also says that the 
“Natural Resources” category of the 
endowment is not just oil and gas. 
They recently changed the section 
name from “Energy” to “Natural 
Resource” to suggest they are 
transitioning their investments to 
renewable energy sources. However, 
when 
comparing 
the 
relative 
returns 
of 
U-M’s 
investments 
to market-wide standards, they 
compare it to “the MSCI World 
Energy Sector Index, as energy is 
by far the largest component of this 
asset class.” “Natural Resources” 
really just means “Oil and Gas.” 
And the transition from oil and gas 
to renewables, if it is happening 
at all, is going slowly. The recent 
endowment reports show that of 
the 11 recent “Natural Resources” 
investments, 10 are in oil and gas 
and one is in renewables. 
Why should the University 
divest? Besides the University’s 
own goal of carbon neutrality, 
the most recent reports from 
the Intergovernmental Panel on 

Climate Change say that humans 
need 
to 
nearly 
halve 
global 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 
to avoid the worst consequences 
of the climate crisis. If we trust 
these 
scientifically-based 
limits 
on greenhouse gases, it makes no 
sense to continue investing in fossil 
fuel projects that only encourage 
further extraction and burning of 
fossil fuels for the next 30 years. We 
need to undo these investments, 
stop 
making 
the 
investments 
altogether or at the very least have a 
conversation about it. But President 
Schlissel won’t allow the PCCN to 
have the conversation. 
Also, fossil fuels meet the 
University’s 
own 
criteria 
for 
divestment. When asked about 
divestment by both faculty and 
students at the President’s Special 
Town Hall on Carbon Neutrality on 
April 9, Schlissel said, “Essentially, 
we don’t divest,” and ended the 
conversation. He is mistaken. The 
University has actually divested 
twice and even has an explicit 
policy for divestment, though it is 
insufficient and unclear, as I wrote 
last April. Despite this lack of clarity, 
fossil fuels meet the policy’s three 
criteria for divestment. 

The 
first 
criterion 
is 
that 
“The concern to be explored 
must express the broadly and 
consistently held position of the 
campus community over time.” 
There is absolutely broad student 
and faculty support for divestment 
right now. On the student side, 
more than 10,000 people came to 
the Washtenaw County Climate 
Strikes in March and September, 
respectively. 
After 
the 
March 
15 strike, students conducted an 
extended study-in at the Fleming 
Administration Building for three 
weeks, calling for — among other 
things — divestment. On the faculty 
side, more than 300 staff members 
signed a letter last year calling 
for the University to divest from 
fossil fuels. Not only is there broad 
consensus right now, but there has 
been consensus for a long time. The 
Daily wrote editorials calling for 
fossil fuel divestment in 2014 and 
2015. 
The second criterion is that, 
“There must be reason to believe 
that the behavior or action in 
question may be antithetical to 
the core mission and values of the 
University.” The only way that 
fossil fuel investments do not meet 
this criterion is if you believe that 
investing in fossil fuels does not 
accelerate the climate crisis, or 
that contributing to the climate 
crisis is not antithetical to the 
University’s core values. Schlissel 
created the PCCN to recommend a 
path to carbon neutrality for U-M 
and to contribute to a sustainable 
and just world. This mission 
statement shows that the University 
recognizes its contributions to 
the climate crisis as antithetical 
to its core values. The University’s 
investments in fossil fuels are one 
such significant contribution, and 
should be treated as incongruent 
with its core values.
The third criterion is that, 
“There must be reason to believe 
that the organization, industry 
or entity to be singled out may 
be 
uniquely 
responsible 
for 

the 
problems 
identified.” 
One 
hundred fossil fuel companies are 
responsible for 71 percent of global 
emissions. Furthermore, fossil 
fuel companies like Exxon Mobil 
were aware of climate-changing 
risks from burning fossil fuels as 
far back as the 1970s, but concealed 
that science while undertaking 
massive, expensive disinformation 
campaigns to sow doubt in our 
society about the independent 
scientific 
evidence 
of 
climate 
change. This industry is uniquely 
responsible both for creating the 
climate crisis and for concealing its 
risks for decades.
So, the University has reason 
to divest from fossil fuels to follow 
its divestment policy, accomplish 
its goal of carbon neutrality and 
help the world meet the IPCC’s 
scientifically-required 
reductions 
in 
greenhouse 
gases. 
The 
University also has experience with 
divestment. When the University 
divested from South Africa during 
Apartheid and from the tobacco 
industry, it created committees to 
discuss and recommend whether or 
not to divest. The commission could 
serve a similar purpose, but U-M 
explicitly forbid its members from 
discussing divestment.
Finally, Schlissel should let the 
commission 
discuss 
divestment 
because it is a reasonable thing to 
do! Schlissel says he is no expert 
in carbon neutrality, which is why 
he 
appointed 
the 
commission. 
And to members of the Climate 
Action Movement, he says that 
we 
should 
trust 
the 
process 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
commission. But by silencing the 
commission on divestment, Schlissel 
shows that he does not trust it and is 
not committed to the political and 
financial steps required for U-M 
to achieve full carbon neutrality. 
The University should trust its 
experts on the commission to make 
decisions about our entire carbon 
footprint, not just the carbon sources 
that are convenient to eliminate. 
What is frustrating about this for 
me personally is that it would not 
be logistically hard to allow the 
commission to discuss divestment. 
All Schlissel has to do is give the 
order and the process would start. 
And while I don’t know this for sure, 
I speculate the expert members 
of the PCCN would be excited to 
hold productive discussions on 
divestment.
The PCCN could even look to 
peer institutions for guidance. Many 
universities have already divested, 
both for moral and financial reasons. 
In September, two officials from the 
University of California co-authored 
an op-ed explaining they are 
divesting 
for 
financial 
reasons 
(though it was more likely organized 
pressure from students and faculty). 
They said, “We continue to believe 
there are more attractive investment 
opportunities in new energy sources 
than in old fossil fuels.” 
Syracuse University, which also 
moved towards divestment from 
fossil fuels in 2015, reported that 
divesting from fossil fuels did not 
hurt the endowment. The University 
of Massachusetts, University of 
Maryland 
and 
Smith 
College 
have also divested. Letting the 
commission talk about fossil fuel 
divestment would align with the 
University’s stated value of carbon 
neutrality. This would allow the 
University’s divestment guidelines 
to work as intended, give appropriate 
weight to the severity of the 
scientifically-established, 
ongoing 
damage from the climate crisis and 
bring U-M into alignment with 
peer institutions working on carbon 
neutrality.

The University should 

trust its experts on the 

commission to make 

decision about our 

entire carbon footprint

Shakespeare is remembered as the 
greatest playwright of all time. The 
greatest 
struggle 
with 
putting 
on 
Shakespeare now, though, is to make it 
fresh and relevant for audiences all over 
the globe. His narratives are geniusly 
concocted, but the vernacular more closely 
resembles rocket science than a light-
hearted rom-com, which was how they 
were originally performed. Such struggles 
were not the case for National Theatre 
Live’s 
production 
of 
Shakespeare’s 
comedy, 
“A 
Midsummer 
Night’s Dream” 
presented 
Sunday 
evening 
by 
the 
University 
Musical Society 
at the Michigan 
Theater.
The 
most 
extraordinary 
aspect 
of 
the 
production was 
how 
specific 
and 
clear 
the 
storytelling 
presented itself. 
Usually, I can 
barely make out every other phrase in a 
Shakespearian play. In this production, 
the actors, among them Gwendolyn 
Christie (“Game of Thrones”), Oliver Chris 
(“Green Wing”), David Moorst (“NT Live: 
Allelujah!”) and Hammed Animashaun 
(“The Barber Shop Chronicles”), managed 
to relay the plot in such a way that I was 
able to enjoy myself the entire time. I 
relaxed into the storyline so much that 
I found myself laughing hysterically 
through most of the production. 
In a society full of Twitter feeds and 
Instagram captions slaughtering any 
sort of poeticism we have left in the 
English language, I felt refreshed by how 
decadent Shakespeare’s language was 
while maintaining the playfulness and 
absurdity of the comedy.
Director Nicholas Hytner changed one 
key aspect of the plotline. He switched 
Titania, played by Christie, and Oberon’s 
lines around so that the king ended up 
having sex with the donkey, Longbottom, 
instead of the queen. The reason for the 
switch was because Hytner lamented 

how serious productions of “Midsummer” 
were becoming. Originally, the queen is 
constantly being humiliated by the king, 
and has no choice but to be presented 
as a very sexist parable. In Hytner’s 
production, the king is tricked by the 
queen and the end result was hysterical. 
Their “lovemaking” was interpreted by a 
dance/silk number to Beyonce’s “Love On 
Top.” Pure genius.
Initially, I was worried by the fact that 
much of the audience stood on the stage for 
the immersive experience. Shakespeare’s 
plays are more of a marathon than a 
sprint. However, the performance was so 
inventive and immersive that I understood 
why the director 
Hytner 
opted 
for 
audience 
participation. 
At times, they 
served as the 
forest for which 
the dream takes 
place. Silks were 
also suspended 
above 
the 
audience 
for 
most of the play 
from 
which 
the actors did 
trapeze 
tricks 
to 
show 
that 
they 
were, 
indeed, 
fairies 
in the production. At intermission, Hytner 
casually said that the performers, world 
class actors, who had never interacted 
with silks before were given three months 
to learn how to maneuver their way 
around silks some 20 feet in the air while 
reciting Shakespearian monologues.
National Theatre Live brings world 
class British theater to cinemas around 
the globe. It’s not difficult to surmise why 
this production of “Midsummer” was so 
brilliant. Theater in Britain receives more 
funding from the government compared 
to the U.S., and actors are allowed a 
significantly longer time to rehearse and 
prepare for each production.
Last year, I attended NTL’s production 
of “Antony and Cleopatra,” and was 
equally impressed. It is such a privilege 
to experience world class performances 
for a low student price, even if it is relayed 
on a screen. In a society full of reality 
television 
and 
superhero 
franchises, 
the ability to refresh classic works as 
efficiently as National Theatre Live did is 
reassuring.

‘Midsummer’ a needed
relief during this winter

After “Ray Donovan” relocated from Los 
Angeles to New York City at the beginning of 
Season 6, there was reason to be concerned 
about how long the crime-drama could 
continue. The change in the setting of a 
television show is often followed by a decrease 
in quality. Some notable examples that come 
to mind include “Glee,” the final season of 
“Scrubs” and the upcoming fourth season of 
“Stranger Things.” But “Ray Donovan” is the 
exception. Moving away from L.A. has allowed 
the show to successfully and logically change 
its 
direction. 
With 
the unique job held 
by Ray Donovan (Liev 
Schreiber, “Spotlight”) 
— 
it’s 
easiest 
to 
describe him as a more 
violent 
Olivia 
Pope 
(Kerry 
Washington, 
“Scandal”) but a “fixer” 
nevertheless 
— 
no 
matter 
the 
location, 
there will always be 
someone in need of his 
services. 
After years of Ray 
battling 
alcoholism, 
anger issues and arrogance, the Season 6 
finale hinted that a change was on the horizon. 
Not just for Ray, but for everyone in his life. 
Each character seems to be on a path of self-
improvement. His father, Mickey (Jon Voight, 
“24”), has finally gone to jail. His brothers, 
Bunchy (Dash Mihok, “Whiskey Cavalier”) 
and Terry (Eddie Marsan, “Deadpool 2”) are 
both living healthier lifestyles. His college-
aged 
daughter, 
Bridget 
(Kerris 
Dorsey, 
“Moneyball”) even apologizes to him. This is 
the newer and happy Donovan family … for 
now.
If there’s one member of the Donovan 
family that deserves eternal happiness, it’s 
Terry, Ray’s brother. Unfortunately, his 
Parkinson’s disease has gotten worse. He 
meets a woman at the drugstore that Bunchy, 
Ray’s other brother, works at who urges him 
to try a natural remedy that will disinfect his 
liver. Elsewhere, Bridget considers ending 
her marriage with Smitty (Graham Rogers, 

“Atypical”) because she has met someone else. 
Ray has begun therapy with Dr. Arthur Amiot 
(Alan Alda, “The Good Fight”), who suggests 
he forgive his father Mickey and let go of all his 
anger. Flash forward four months, and some 
fishermen discover the heads of one of the 
officers that the Donovans killed in the season 
five finale. To make matters worse, there is 
still a bullet in the victim’s head and is going 
to be tested by ballistics which could lead the 
police back to Ray. Like I said, how long could 
this path of self improvement really last for the 
Donovans?
This is what sets the episode in motion 
as Ray tries to move on from his past while 
still being haunted by it. Ray shows flashes of 
this new lifestyle — he 
punches a guy for one 
of his clients but then 
apologizes 
and 
says 
he could have handled 
things better and urges 
the guy to “get the help 
he needs.” But Ray is 
still under the control of 
New York City Mayor Ed 
Ferrati (Zach Grenier, 
“The Good Wife”). Ray 
cannot possibly keep up 
this “new lifestyle,” as 
he is still involved in the 
same “fixer” business 
that forced him to turn the very violent 
behavior he’s setting out to end, but he’s trying 
to do better.
Oh, and remember the bullet in the victim’s 
head? Well, Ray decides he will put Mickey’s 
fingerprints on the gun as he is already in 
jail. But, he can’t do that if Mickey never gets 
there. Most of Ray’s problems are rooted in 
his relationship with Mickey so it comes as no 
surprise that another huge one is created in 
the final minutes of this episode. 
The episode ends with a bus full of convicts 
— including Mickey — getting transferred to 
a maximum security prison upstate. Up the 
road, a tanker truck driver has a heart attack 
while inclining. This results in the tanker 
rolling back down and smashing into the bus 
full of convicts with an explosion that could 
have been seen from a zip code over. What 
does this mean for the rest of the season? Is 
he dead? Did he live and escape? Regardless, 
Ray’s therapist is going to have his hands full.

‘Donovan’ is still intense

Compared to other legendary hip-hop producers 
that got their beginnings in the ’90s, DJ Shadow has 
not quite kept up. Just look at his peers who are on top 
of the world right now, even after 25 years in the game. 
El-P is pumping out some of the hardest production 
of his career as part of Run The Jewels, somehow 
competing with contemporary experimentalists like 
clipping., Death Grips and JPEGMAFIA. Madlib is 
still a prolific music making machine, maintaining 
his iconic lo-fi sound for modern rap rock stars like 
Kanye West, cooking up beats on his iPad for shits and 
giggles. And then there’s DJ Shadow. The eccentric. 
The kooky collector with more vinyl records in his 
possession than the average American household’s 
yearly income. The hip-hop trailblazer who has never 
been able to turn heads with his music the way his 
debut album did in ’96. Behold: He is out with a brand 
new 90-minute behemoth.
Our Pathetic Age is more interesting before 
listening, with its flashy 
Roy 
Lichtenstein-esque 
cover art and two-pronged 
structure: The first half is 
all instrumentals, while the 
second half is packed with 
features. Guest vocalists are 
an unconvential mix of OG 
rap legends (Nas, De La Soul, 
some of Wu-Tang Clan’s 
hardest 
hitters), 
modern 
hip-hop kings (Run The Jewels, Pusha T) and random 
nobodies (who the fuck is Barny Fletcher?).
DJ Shadow doesn’t shy away from flexing his 
technical ability on this record. “Slingblade” is 
horrifying and perplexing, with freaky pitched vocal 
samples and sputtering cyberpunk synths. There’s 
something weird going on with the percussion that 
makes it unsatisfying to the listener’s expectations, 
creating an intentional discomfort that might be better 
unpacked by someone who understands music theory.
By the time “Juggernaut” comes on, it’s obvious DJ 
Shadow wants you to feel an oppressive weight through 
the music. His weapons of choice are overwhelming 
noisey blares, too many snares and that creepy sound 
you always hear in horror movie trailers. Then plays 
a vocal sample where a man says, “Sometimes you 
are so charmed by the music, he might be saying 
‘death, death, death,’ and you would not notice.” The 
title is Our Pathetic Age and the album cover is a girl 
staring at a smartphone. It takes very little effort to 
decipher the album’s message. It’s like that episode of 
“SpongeBob” when Squidward accidentally gets stuck 
in the Krusty Krab freezer for 2,000 years. This album 
is just DJ Shadow curling on the floor screaming 
“FUUTUUUREEE.”
OK boomer.
There are some other neat cuts in the mix on 
side A. “Firestorm” is an orchestral composition; 
that’s something new for DJ Shadow, whose debut 
Endtroducing has a Guinness World Record for being 
the first album recorded with only sampled sounds. 

It’s got some Toby Fox vibes going on, invoking the 
magic and nostalgia of the “Undertale” soundtrack. 
That’s an influence I never expected to find on a DJ 
Shadow album. The highlight instrumental is “Rosie.” 
The way the vocal sample gets chopped up and 
deconstructed is terrifying. By the midpoint, when the 
eerie oscillating synths and sticky bassline kick in, I’m 
seeing little Rosie in my midnight dreams.
For the most part, though, the beats on disc one 
sound a little too sterile, a little too unfocused, a little 
too lost and rambling in their runtime. That leaves 
the weight of this bloated album on the backs of all 
the zany disc two features. Could fire verses save this 
album?
Maybe they could have, but the majority of the raps 
on this half are not fire. They’re not even mediocre. 
They’re mostly dirt that snuffs this album out. If disc 
one invokes the OK boomer meme, then disc two is 
cashing it in for all its worth. Immediately on “Drone 
Warfare,” the societal commentary is extremely heavy 
handed. There is nothing clever about lines like “I 
duct tape the cam on a Mac Pro” or “My smartphone’s 
listening.” It’s like DJ Shadow got a bunch of hip hop 
legends on the album just to 
spout off vague doomsday-
sounding bullshit. 
That unwoke commentary 
on society today pervades 
throughout 
most 
of 
the 
verses 
on 
the 
album. 
The 
worst 
offender 
is 
“C.O.N.F.O.R.M.,” featuring 
the most uninspired and 
cringe-inducing lyrics about 
social media I have ever heard. The production isn’t 
bad at least. It’s just that the piano keys literally sound 
like the intro to the “Goosebumps” TV series, and I 
cannot unhear it for the life of me.
There are bits of gold that shine beneath DJ 
Shadow’s 
oppressively 
unimpressive 
thematic 
direction. Inspectah Deck, Ghostface Killah and 
Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan spit some of the album’s 
smoothest verses on “Rain On Snow,” sandwiched 
between a blood-chilling chorus. “Rocket Fuel” is 
blessed by De La Soul’s unwieldy groove, the only 
instance of cheer on the entire album that makes for 
a breath of fresh air among the futuristic despair. The 
beat on “Taxin’” would not sound out of place on an 
album from a modern LA rapper like ScHoolboy Q or 
Jay Rock. Unsurprisingly, Run The Jewels bring the 
heat on “Kings & Queens,” rapping over a gorgeous 
soul sample. And the best vocal performance goes to 
Pusha T on the bonus track “Been Use Ta.” He raps 
over the unfortunate beat from “C.O.N.F.O.R.M.,” but 
with far better writing and delivery than the random 
wackjobs DJ Shadow enlisted for the not-bonus 
version.
Our Pathetic Age has its high points on both discs, but 
bloat is the death of this record. On the instrumental 
half, it’s mediocre bloat, and on the feature-packed 
half, it’s poisonous bloat. Cut out the unfocused tracks 
from side A and the god-awful tracks from side B, 
string it together a little more cohesively, and this 
album might have been memorable. Too bad it’s only 
middling at best.

ALBUM REVIEW

DYLAN YONO
Daily Arts Writer

The most 
extraordinary aspect 
of the production 
was how specific and 
clear the storytelling 
presented itself.

Only Dolly Parton could get away with “Dolly 
Parton’s Heartstrings.” That is, if Dolly herself didn’t 
appear in each episode, this show would be nothing 
more than Netflix’s attempt to corner the Hallmark 
feel-good movie market.
“Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings” consists of eight 
episodes with unrelated storylines all based on the 
most famous of Parton’s songs. Each episode explores 
a different aspect of family, friendship, love, loss or 
acceptance, and features Dolly’s own commentary on 
the history of each song’s creation and legacy.
The series’s first episode takes inspiration from 
famed song “Jolene” and reimagines the titular 
character (Julianne Hough, “Grease Live!”) as a 
struggling musician stifled by the traditions of a 
small town. The next story, “Two Doors Down,” 
has a similarly light, comedic tone and follows an 
estranged family as they each reveal personal secrets 
during a lavish New Year’s Eve wedding. Other than 
a few various petty conflicts, every loose end in these 
episodes ties up nicely and each have happy (albeit 
slightly unrealistic) endings.
While the opening episodes of “Heartstrings” are 
framed as lighthearted comedies, the series becomes 
more of a melodramatic tragedy than the average 
holiday heartwarmer as it progresses. “If I Had 
Wings” and “Cracker Jack” delve into Parton’s sadder 
tunes and depict fractured families or friend groups 
torn apart by terminal illness or addiction. Though 

some moments are genuinely emotional, most of these 
episodes feel engineered to produce tears, rather than 
to elicit the emotions so central to Parton’s music.
Despite its best attempts to connect with what 
makes Dolly Parton an icon, “Heartstrings” feels 
too commercial and hollow in comparison to its 
source material. With vapid and occasionally 
ridiculous dialogue, characters closely resemble 
two-dimensional archetypes employed to easily 
move stories forward. Even the storylines, which 
consistently rely on plot twists, seem too simplistic 
and trite to get invested in.
Without the compelling narratives of Parton’s 
original lyrics, “Heartstrings” fails to capture the 
heart of the country singer’s music. However, for 
all its faults, the show succeeds in capturing the 
fun of her storytelling. Dolly Parton has long been 
one of the kindest and truly positive musicians in 
American pop culture. Despite the cheesiest aspects 
of “Heartstrings,” the wholesome joy of the series 
is undeniable. Even with iffy writing and moments 
more worthy of eye rolls than tears, the 
show’s heart is in the right place.
Dolly’s personal involvement with 
each episode serves as the perfect 
reminder to the audience that her 
music is more about feeling than 
judging. 
Although 
“Heartstrings” 
tries its hardest to manufacture these 
feelings in abundance and loses out on 
some of her songs’ subtleties, the show 
still retains some of the sentiment in 
Parton’s lyrics.
“Heartstrings” is less focused on 
technical quality and devotes itself 
instead to being a comforting show 
for 
the 
holiday 
season. 
Without 
Dolly’s 
infectious 
personality, 
the 
show probably wouldn’t work. But 
if you love the Queen of Nashville 
enough to overlook the show’s flaws, 
“Heartstrings” is worth the watch.

Thanksgiving is the two-day-old meat in the sandwich 
of holidays that lies within the months of October through 
December. Halloween season is full of spooky stories and 
costumes. December is filled to the brim with gift-giving and 
snowmen. Thanksgiving is rooted in racism, arguing relatives 
and an underwhelming parade in New York. 
While Thanksgiving has many negative stereotypes, there is 
one thing I enjoy about it: The attitude of gratitude that resides 
in not only me, but my closest family and friends. Thanksgiving 
is a time to spend appreciating the things you would usually 
take for granted. This Thanksgiving, I want to shed light on 
something that I never thought I’d be grateful for. 
I’ve had anxiety since I was little. I started taking medicine 
for it after I graduated high school. It’s no secret that having 
anxiety is hard, especially when it comes to my art. The 
constant nagging of never being good enough in my mind 
pushes me to do better. However, this pursuit of perfection 
often turns sour quickly. This year, my perfectionism broke me 
for the first time in months. 
Have you ever cried in class? It’s awful. It’s embarrassing 
and vulnerable, but at the same time could potentially be the 
best thing to happen to you during your collegiate career. 
Earlier this year, I cried in my acting class. The tears in my 
eyes swelled up and burned hot against my cheeks. I wanted 
them to stop, but they kept falling one after the other — a 
physical manifestation of the frustration I had with myself.
We had been working on a difficult scene. The scene work 
had been going on for at least two weeks. With my anxiety, 
I often tend to extremely over-prepare or drastically under-

prepare. When I under-prepare, I lay in bed all day thinking 
about what I could be doing, but don’t have the effort or 
motivation to. When I over-prepare, I figure out everything to 
the most minute detail in an effort to ensure that all the “what 
if” scenarios flooding my head never become a reality. For this 
particular class, I was over-prepared, and it ended up being my 
downfall. I was working too hard. I had memorized the lines, I 
had read the script three times, I had done hours of research, I 
had set myself up to succeed. Yet each day, I failed. 
My 
professor 
would 
give 
me 
more 
critiques 
than 
compliments. I knew the work I was doing was not where I 
wanted it to be. Instead of taking these critiques as a learning 
experience, I started to take them personally. One day, during 
one of our end of class discussions, I let the critiques get the 
best of me. 
My head was littered with questions: What am I doing 
wrong? Why is my pacing too fast? Why am I not playing into 
the given circumstances of the scene? Why am I not listening 
to my scene partner? As I had time to anxiously stew in my own 
thoughts, my questions got bigger and less founded in reality: 
Why am I so bad? What if I’m never good enough to make a 
living as an actor? What if my professor hates me? What if 
everyone hates me? The list of questions racing through my 
brain could go on for pages. I couldn’t get them to stop. 
I sat idle as the class talked about their work, yet my brain 
was moving at a million miles a minute. My professor noticed 
I was not fully present in the group’s conversations. He made 
a joke, and I didn’t laugh because, quite frankly, I was so lost 
in my own thoughts that I didn’t hear the joke being made. He 
coyishly asked me, “Do you not think I’m funny?” To which I 
replied, “No, I was just — I wasn’t listening.”
After class he approached me. 
“Alix,” he started, “What’s wrong?”

I wanted to brush off his comment. Say “Nothing, I’m just 
tired” and walk away. But all of a sudden, every ounce of 
frustration I was feeling boiled up inside of me. I started to 
cry. 
“I don’t know, I guess — I feel like I’m doing a bad job,” I 
said, wiping away the tears.
“You’re not doing a bad job. You’re just not being present,” 
he replied. 
It was these words that sparked a groundbreaking realization 
for my artistry. Throughout my life I had thought that the 
harder I was on myself, the better I’d become. Yet, upon 
reflecting on other acting assignments, I realized it was my 
own self-deprecation that had stunted my growth. No one was 
telling me I was a bad actor except for me. Critiques were given 
to me, but the projection of my own insecurities onto them is 
what made these critiques impossible to listen to. The next day 
in class, I approached the scene with a sense of being present. 
I still knew all my lines and blocking, of course, but I tried 
my best to get out of my own head. I practiced an approach of 
self-awareness that I had never thought possible before. When 
a self-deprecating thought entered my mind, I ignored it and 
focused on the scene instead. I’ve practiced methods similar 
to this with meditation, but I never thought to apply them to 
my art. This was difficult, and it certainly didn’t happen the 
entire time, but I was trying. 
Anxiety with any art form is a hard battle to overcome. 
There are many days where I wish my brain would just shut up, 
days I want to reach into my own skull and pull out all the bits 
that make living with anxiety so hard. But there are also days 
like the one I had in class, where I experience monumental 
growth. There are days that I can see the light at the end of the 
tunnel. I’ll think of these days and people like my professor 
that help me get there this Thursday.

The anxious artist and learning to believe in my art

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

ALIX CURNOW

It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times. 
Holidays are always equal parts joyous and frightening, long-
awaited and spirit-breaking. We all love our families. We also 
hate them a tiny bit, too — it’s OK to admit it, I said it first. 
But this Thanksgiving won’t be like the others. No, 
you’re going to go in prepared — defenses ready, arms 
locked and loaded. Enter upon America’s beloved day 
of justified gluttony steeled against the onslaught of 
“Are you dating anyone?” “What exactly are you going 
to use your English major for?” “I’ve never heard of 
the University of Michigan, is it any good?” And last, 
but by far the most painful: “Let’s gooooo Buckeyes!” 
Godspeed, if you’re returning home to a football 
rivalry family. 
Your secret weapon? Allow me to humbly offer this 
playlist. May your holiday be the movie montage we 
all wish we had. 
For the Pilgrimage:
You’re excited, everyone is optimistic and a good 
mood reigns free. But you know, deep, deep down 
that something wicked this way comes. To balance 
the pessimism and optimism of the pilgrimage back 
home, or the run up to the holiday if you’re staying 
put, listen to Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Bad 
Moon Rising.” Shame we couldn’t listen to their 
warming, “I see a bad moon rising / I see trouble on 
the way.”
For That One Question: 
Mistakenly, you believed you had made it through the holiday 
without someone asking the dreaded question of your single 
status. Or, if you are “cuffed,” that you need to find someone 
better. Ugh, right? I suggest Lana Del Rey’s “Norman Fucking 
Rockwell.” Maybe not the exact fiery, don’t-care attitude you 
might expect — but soft fall vibes, Lana’s dreamy voice, what 

more do you need to mourn single-dome? Plus, as Lana says in 
her song, no one needs a “man-child,” so you can celebrate your 
freedom from one. It’s the perfect song for an efficient mope-
session in a borrowed bedroom. 
For When the Turkey Starts Burning: 
Tensions rise as the smoke of that crisp, brittle bird fills 
the air. You know what’s coming. Suddenly, everything starts 
to go wrong: Dinner isn’t ready yet! Mom’s nerves are on the 

fritz, the kitchen is 1000 degrees, it’s nearing 4 p.m. and people 
are getting antsy. Family member turns on family member — 
it’s survival of the fittest, every man for themselves. “Staying 
Alive” by The Funky Town will add some appreciated disco 
flair as well as motivate you to get out of the kitchen, and as 
far away as possible before the bomb goes off and Mom realizes 

someone has already stolen a slice of pie! 
For When Someone is Inevitably Injured:
Someone decides to clean the gutter, a knuckle is grated or 
a bout of good-natured wrestling among siblings or cousins 
go wrong — tears, cussing and “Another One Bites The Dust.” 
Whether you’re in the middle of the fray, or — like me — 
watching from the sidelines with a glass of wine and a snack, 
nothing will narrate Thanksgiving fumbles better than Queen. 
For When Things Get Melancholy: 
Post-dinner and everyone is lazing around the 
house, hoping that by laying, the nausea might 
go away. Grandma or Grandpa are holding court 
somewhere with a glass of something that screams 
The Great Depression. Without warning, suddenly 
you’re thrown violently down memory lane and 
the vibe check lands hard — things go melancholy 
fast. While Gramps waxes poetic on the greatest 
generation, play Willie Nelson’s “Are You Sure.” It’s 
appropriately reminiscent and slow, good for when 
you’re too tired to fight the good fight. Plus, it’s an 
oldie-but-a-goodie and without fail will cue some 
(much needed) contemplative silence. 
For the “OK, Boomer” Moment: 
The family gets a second wind over pie, and 
niceties are dropped now that dinner is over. It’s like 
the indulgence in dessert is a green light for all the 
taboo dinner table topics you shuffled around before: 
politics, religion, family gossip. Someone accidentally 
lets a “Trump” or “Obama” slip, and bam! It’s a 
plummet of no-return. All bets are off, time to use the 
random handful of intro-level political science facts 
you’ve held onto from freshman year to wage a one-
person battle. The Happy Fits’s “Dirty Imbecile” embraces our 
craziness while brushing off the buzzkill attitude of the rest of 
the world. They sing, “if I’m so smart and I’m so pretty / damn 
this town and damn this city / you never give me anything that 
I want,” like a break, or some respect, or a planet that isn’t 
trying to die on us.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

HOLLYWOOD RECORDS / YOUTUBE

For a movie centered around a famous children’s television 
show host, “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” deals with 
some heavy topics — primarily anger and how it can consume 
you. I suppose that makes sense, though, considering that is 
what the original show “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” did as 

well. Just like the show, the movie frames these heavy topics in 
a way that makes them suitable for kids. And by following the 
style of the original television show, the filmmakers beautifully 
soften the harsh topics.
The film opens up by introducing us to Mister Rogers, played 
by Tom Hanks (“Forrest Gump”), who explains to the audience 
that he will be talking about his friend Lloyd Vogel (Matthew 
Rhys, “The Post”) and some of the hardships in his life. Hanks’s 
portrayal of Rogers is easily one of the most successful parts of 
the film; every time he is on-screen, he has a gentle, easy-going 
manner that matches that of the real Mister Rogers.
What is interesting about the movie, though, is that it isn’t 

really about Mister Rogers. It really follows Lloyd Vogel. The 
movie was inspired by the article written by Tom Junod, the 
man who Vogel is presumably based on. Vogel, like Junod, is a 
magazine writer who is tasked with writing a ‘hero-centered’ 
article about Mister Rogers. Initially believing the man to 
be hoax, Vogel doesn’t want to write the article. But as he 
interviews the man, he begins to learn that Mister Rogers is 
just as good a man off-screen as he is on-screen. Through the 
lessons that Rogers preaches on his television program, through 
the stuffed animals and puppets starring on “Mister Rogers’ 
Neighborhood” and through genuine conversations with Rogers 
about important matters of life, Vogel realizes that he has to let 
go of the anger he has been holding in, releasing the contempt 
he feels towards his father all his life. 
I have no shame in admitting that I cried while watching 
this film. There is something incredibly moving about pulling 
back the curtains on this children’s television host so loved by 
the world. One scene features Rogers and Vogel on the subway 
together, where a group of kids sees Rogers and begins to sing 
his show’s famous theme song. Other people in the subway 
car join in until everyone is singing. Seeing that moment of 
togetherness from a group of people who don’t know each other 
is, in many ways, what Mister Rogers is all about: kindness. 
The film makes you want to be a better person. Viewers will 
see Tom Hanks as Mister Rogers and some distant part of them 
— the part of them that remembers watching Rogers’s show, 
learning about his kindness, and wanting to be just like him, 
will awaken. The 
movie 
follows 
Vogel 
because 
we, the audience, 
are Vogel. We are 
learning 
what 
kindness 
is, 
just 
like he is. We are 
in awe of Mister 
Rogers 
just 
like 
him. We, at the end 
of the film, will be 
just as transformed 
as he is.

‘Beautiful Day’ is moving, naturally

While families come together 
from far and wide to devour 
turkey, watch football and reluc-
tantly talk politics, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team will be 
facing its fiercest competition 
to date at the Battle 4 Atlantis 
Tournament.
Hosted every year in the Ba-
hamas, the tournament hosts a 
variety of college basketball’s 
historic programs in an ear-
ly-season slugfest prime for early 
resume-building and testing 
weaknesses.
 This year, the Bahamas will 

welcome the Wolverines (4-0) 
along with No. 6 North Carolina 
(4-0), No. 8 Gonzaga (6-0), No. 10 
Oregon (5-0), No. 13 Seton Hall 
(4-1), Iowa State (3-1), Alabama 
(2-2) and Southern Miss (2-3). 
On Wednesday, Michigan kicks 
off the tournament against the 
Cyclones in one of its first true 
tests of the season.
 The Wolverines are guaranteed 
at least three games throughout 
their stay in Atlantis and could 
face any of the visiting opponents 
throughout the tournament.
 The Daily breaks down the 
three teams Michigan is most 
likely to face and what the Wol-
verines must be thankful for in 
the event of a Thanksgiving day 

win.
 Iowa State
 When the Wolverines take the 
floor on Wednesday against Iowa 
State, they will face a team that 
is practically their mirror image. 
Well, more like a funhouse mirror 
that slightly distorts the image.
 The Cyclones use an up-tempo 
offense centered around a dy-
namic, ball-dominant guard who 
excels at ball distribution and 
rains 3-point shots. Add some 
bruising post players and a slight-
ly worse turnover ratio and you 
have the Michigan Wolverines.
 Iowa State’s offense is high-
lighted by one of the most 
exciting players in the country in 
sophomore Tyrese Haliburton. 

The point guard leads the nation 
in assists per game with 10.3. 
Who’s number three on that list? 
Senior guard Zavier Simpson.
 Haliburton has emerged this 
season as one of the best facili-
tators in college basketball and 
continues his potent threat from 
deep after hitting 43.4 percent of 
his shots from beyond the arc last 
season.
 Accompanying Haliburton 
is a loaded backcourt in Penn 
State transfer Rasir Bolton and 
Colorado State transfer Prentiss 
Nixon. Bolton leads the team in 
points per game, with 12.5, and is 
a consistent perimeter threat.
 Per usual this season, Michi-
gan’s clear advantage here is size 
and presence down low. If the 
Wolverines can find points in the 
paint, rebound effectively and 
find ways to neutralize Halibur-
ton’s prolific passing, then they 
should be able to walk out with 
an important win.
 North Carolina
 If Michigan snakes out a win 
on Wednesday, it’s set to face the 
winner of Alabama-North Caro-
lina. Assuming the Tar Heels, the 
clear favorite, take this one, the 
Wolverines will face their tough-
est opponent to date.
 North Carolina has mowed 
down opponents thus far this 
season on its way to a 4-0 record 
and a plus-13.7 scoring margin. 
And it all goes through one 
man: freshman sensation Cole 
Anthony.
 Saying the Tar Heels’ entire 
team identity is shaped around 
one figure will take some getting 
used to for college basketball 
pundits this season. North 

Carolina coach Roy Williams has 
consistently favored depth on his 
rosters and uses a wide array of 
talent to carve up opponents.
 This season, though, that’s not 
the case; everything has rested 
on Anthony’s shoulders. So far, 
this is the furthest thing from a 
problem seeing as the true fresh-
man is leading the team in many 
statistical categories, including 
points per game (22.8), assists 
(4.5) and steals (1.8).
 Aside from the freshman phe-
nom, North Carolina has used 
its elite size to outrebound and 
outplay its opponents early in the 
season. If Michigan matches up 
against the Tar Heels in Atlantis, 
big men Jon Teske and Colin 
Castleton will have to prepare for 
a battle down low.
 Alabama
 Pay attention, because up-tem-
po basketball with prolific guard 
play will be a running theme 
throughout this tournament; and 
the Crimson Tide might exempli-
fy this more than any other team.
 Alabama coach Nate Oats loves 
running wheeling-and-dealing 
offenses whose guards almost 
consistently find success scoring 
the ball. This year’s leading guard 
comes in the form of 6-foot-3 
sophomore Kira Lewis.
 As a 17-year old freshman last 
season, Lewis led the team in 
many offensive categories and 
stands to be a primary key of 
Oats’ new offensive system. He 
leads the team with an eye-
brow-raising 21.5 points per 
game. Accompanying Lewis are 
other capable guards in freshman 
guard Jaden Shackleford and 
West Virginia transfer Beetle 

Bolden.
 If Michigan has proven any-
thing early in the season, it’s that 
it knows how to handle up-tempo 
teams who love to launch a lot 
of 3-point shots. The Wolverines 
have conquered similar offenses 
in Creighton and Houston Bap-
tist, making the necessary defen-
sive adjustments and hammering 
their opponents down low.
 When it comes down to it, a 
mid-level Alabama team should 
not threaten Michigan.
 Gonzaga, Oregon, Seton Hall, 
Southern Miss
 The other side of the bracket 
comes loaded with ranked teams 
in Gonzaga, Oregon and Seton 
Hall. For the sake of brevity, 
enjoy one sentence of analysis for 
each team.
 Gonzaga: Forward Killian Tillie 
is back, and his ability to stretch 
the floor makes the Bulldogs a 
lethal team with a multi-faceted 
offensive attack.
 Oregon: Another absolutely 
loaded backcourt highlighted 
by premier point guard Payton 
Pritchard which will keep even 
the most tenacious defenses up 
at night (The Wolverines take 
on the Ducks on Dec. 14 in Ann 
Arbor).
 Seton Hall: Good luck to Simp-
son in trying to lock down the 
one-man wrecking crew that is 
Myles Powell.
 Southern Mississippi: While the 
Golden Eagles may seem like a 
fish out of water among the fierce 
competition, big man Boban 
Jacdonmi (16.4 points and 7.6 re-
bounds per game) has emerged as 
a leader and could keep Southern 
Miss in some games.

Jack Aho kicked into full gear, 
edging ahead of the crowd in 
the final stretch of the 6.2-mile 
NCAA Championship race. 
As the end approached, the 
junior burst into form, finishing 
the course at 40th place, just 
enough to clinch All-American 
honors for the second straight 
year.
 The final race of the sea-
son proved to be one of the 
strongest performances of the 
year for the No. 16 Michigan 

men’s cross country team, 
which finished seventh out of 
31 teams for the Wolverines’ 
highest finish at the champion-
ships since 1999. When asked 
what stood out about this team 
that allowed them to have such 
success, Michigan coach Kevin 
Sullivan singled out a handful of 
his runners.
 “(Junior) Devin Meyrer, who’s 
been one of our captains this 
year, has been one of the biggest 
leaders on the team,” Sullivan 
said. “He’s also been our No. 1 
runner in every race but one. 
(Senior) Isaac Harding and Jack 
Aho have also both consis-

tently improved throughout 
the season, and (junior) Joost 
(Plaetinck) has had a breakout 
year for us. They’ve really been 
a force for us, especially the last 
four meets of the season.”
 Aho and Meyrer both finished 
in the top-40, which automati-
cally grants a runner All-Amer-
ican honors. Meanwhile, 
Harding just missed the cut at 
44th place, and senior Jordy 
Hewitt and Plaetinck also ran 
to strong finishes at 96th and 
101st, respectively. The team’s 
strong finish came as no sur-
prise to Sullivan, who expressed 
strong confidence in his team’s 

abilities.
 “Every one of our guys ran 
the way I knew they could run.” 
Sullivan said. “I think its fantas-
tic that we had two All-Ameri-
cans in Devin Meyrer and Jack 
Aho. When you factor in that 
Isaac Harding just missed out, 
we were this close to having 
three All-Americans. It wasn’t 
so much that anybody ran better 
than expectations as much as 
it was that we all came and put 
our best races together on the 
same day. That’s what it takes to 
perform well as a team.”
 The team carried significant 
momentum into the NCAA 

Championships, with big finish-
es in each of the past two weeks. 
The previous week, with bids to 
the championships on the line, 
Michigan finished third out of 
29 teams at the Great Lakes In-
vitational. In doing so, the Wol-
verines beat out Indiana and 
Wisconsin, two teams ranked 
higher at the time, and clinched 
their eighth appearance at the 
championship meet in the past 
nine years. 
 The week before that, Michi-
gan finished in third place at the 
Big Ten Championships, scoring 
higher than a Purdue team 
ranked in the top 10 at the time 

of the race. This string of meets 
allowed the team to achieve one 
of its preseason goals – finishing 
in the top 10 at the champion-
ships.
 “The nice thing about our 
team is that they always kept 
their composure and felt they 
could be a top-10 team,” Sulli-
van said. “This was something 
our team never lost sight of 
throughout the course of the 
year. This was the stage where 
our performance really mat-
tered. 
 “It was one last opportunity to 
end the season strong, and we 
took advantage of that.”

As Mason Parris rises, he
continues to stay the course

 As Michigan’s Mason Parris 
mingled with a procession of 
young fans decked head-to-toe in 
maize and blue clamoring for his 
signature on their hats, t-shirts and 
posters, the sophomore heavy-
weight and team captain took a 
moment to reflect upon the hard 
fought win over Central Michi-
gan’s Matt Stencel that sealed his 
team’s victory. 
 For Parris, as the successes ac-
crue, so too do the responsibilities. 
Acutely aware of his rising profile, 
he doubles down on the habits 
that made him an elite wrestler, 
locker room leader and owner of a 
budding fanbase. Take it from his 
coach.
 “Mason’s a great leader,” said 
Michigan coach Sean Bormet. 
 “The style he wrestles is the style 
we like to see at all the weight 
classes, so I really like that we 
have a heavyweight that pours on 
the offense, that wants to score 
a lot of points and wants to put 
guys on their back and pin them. 
And that’s another reason he’s the 
captain.”
 Parris’ example was not lost 
on his teammates. Freshman 

141-pounder Cole Mattin’s gutsy 
come-from-behind win was his 
first at Cliff Keen Arena. Redshirt 
freshman 174-pounder Max May-
lor also capped his home debut 
with a win, the first match of the 
meet in which a Michigan wrestler 
secured riding time advantage. 
But in an afternoon replete with 
star performances, Parris’ shone 
brightest.
 “He dominated the action in that 
match,” Bormet said. “It didn’t 
result in a score until towards the 
end of the match, but all that work 
he did and all that action he creat-
ed in the match led to that score.”
Parris, the No. 3 heavyweight in 
the country, is well-acquainted 
with his opponent, No. 7 Matt 
Stencel. Sunday marked the sixth 
meeting between the two. Parris 
now leads the series 4-2, but it was 
Stencel who eliminated him from 
the 2018-19 NCAA Championships 
in Pittsburgh. 
 “Wrestling him is always a really 
good rivalry,” Parris said. “He’s the 
one who put me out at NCAAs, so 
it’s definitely something I thought 
about all year round, just beating 
him. He’s the one who kind of 
stopped me from my goals last 
year, so I knew I had to give it my 
all every time I wrestle him, but I 

know it’s always gonna be a great 
match every time we go.”
 In what the public address 
announcer called the “marquee 
match of the day,” Parris took to 
the mat with deafening applause. 
For much of the first period, Sten-
cel and Parris, as all good wrestlers 
do, lunged at one another like bulls 
locking horns, each trying to size 
up the other. The period ended 
without a score, but the one who 
struck first would likely emerge 
the victor.
 Parris is deceptively shifty for a 
heavyweight. In the second period, 
he slipped out from under Sten-
cel’s grasp, earning a point on the 
escape. Stencel responded in kind, 
tying the match with an escape of 
his own. But Parris slammed the 
door shut in the waning seconds of 
the third period, pinning his foe to 
the ground, taking the match, 4-1.
 Yet even in victory, Parris seeks 
improvement.
 “I’m getting better each week 
moving my hands, moving my 
feet, getting to my attacks, and this 
week, just after that match, still 
working on that stuff and still fin-
ishing my takedowns,” Parris said. 
 “I just know the guys look up to 
me, so I’ve always got to stay really 
good and just lead by example.”

 In cross country, the entire sea-
son comes down to one day. The 
months of training, the many races 
and the countless miles all can lead 
to a euphoric climax or a feeling of 
missed opportunity. The Michigan 
women’s cross country team got 
the latter. 
 The Wolverines came into Sat-
urday’s meet ranked eighth in the 
country and with a shot to finish 
on the podium. The day didn’t 
go as planned, though, as they 
finished 13th, failing to capture 
their seventh top-10 finish in the 
last 10 years.
 “You always want to try and 
come out of here ranked better 
than you were going in,” said 
Michigan coach Mike McGuire. 
“And in that regard, we didn’t meet 
our objective.”
 Michigan’s biggest problem was 
its rough start. At the two-kilo-
meter mark the Wolverines found 
themselves in 10th and had only 
freshman Erika VanderLende 
running near the front of the 

race. Their second through fifth 
runners were packed up near the 
100th-place mark. For reference, 
the teams vying for a top-five spot 
all put four to five runners ahead of 
the Wolverines’ second runner, ju-
nior Kathryn House, who McGuire 
said “was compromised” coming 
in, as she had a cold. Junior Maddy 
Trevisan — a team leader through-
out the year— also didn’t have the 
best performance, she finished in 
145th.
 One of Michigan’s bright spots 
was VanderLende. She was the 
third-highest finishing fresh-
man, coming in 25th and earning 
All-American honors.
 With Saturday being the last race 
of the season, this also meant one 
last time for the seniors to repre-
sent the block ’M’ on their chest.
 “(The seniors) would’ve liked to 
go out on a bit of a higher note,” 
McGuire said. “We’ll measure it off 
the body of work and the season 
that we had, it still was solid. But 
it wasn’t reflective of the trend 
we made going forward out of the 
regional meet, and in that regard it 
was a bit of a disappointment.”
 While disappointed with the 

outcome, McGuire also talked 
about the season as a whole being 
what they should focus on. And 
for good reason, as the Wolverines 
took second place in the regional 
meet and third in the Big Ten 
meet. And, while their lofty goals 
at the beginning of the season 
never materialized, they’ll still 
have a top-15 finish to look back 
on and a breakout season from 
VanderLende, who could be one of 
the sport’s brightest stars for years 
to come.
 McGuire also talked about 
the impact Trevisan had on the 
team and what she meant to the 
program.
 “Our captain Maddy Trevisan did 
a great job,” McGuire said. “Her 
impact on the program has been 
long-felt and we’re gonna miss 
her.”
 So, in a sport where one day can 
define an entire season for good 
or for worse, McGuire made sure 
to remember the journey that led 
up to that final day and reflect on 
everything, good and bad.
 “Overall, it was a pretty good 
season,” McGuire said. “
Just not a 
great day.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Last week, as students tailgated 
before Michigan’s game against 
Michigan State, Psi Upsilon 
fraternity draped a bedsheet out a 
window of their house. The ban-
ner, ostensibly to offer up a roast 
of the Spartans, read: “You can’t 
touch us, @LarryNassar.”
 There are a lot of legitimate 
things to insult 
Michigan State 
about, starting 
with its on-field 
results against 
the Wolverines 
the past two 
years. But Psi 
Upsilon’s sign 
crossed a line, 
big time.
 The Larry 
Nassar scandal 
is one of the 
worst sexual 
assault scandals 
in sports histo-
ry. At Michi-
gan State and 
later with USA 
Gymnastics, 
Nassar, a trainer 
and team doctor, sexually abused 
hundreds of people. Multiple ad-
ministrators at those institutions 
covered it up for decades. It’s an 
example of large-scale institu-
tional failure, not an item in a ri-
valry. There are Nassar survivors 
at Michigan, and countless more 
survivors of sexual violence. By 
casually mentioning Nassar as a 
reason the Wolverines are better 
than the Spartans, Psi Upsilon 
diminished the experiences of all 
of them.
 Even top U.S. gymnast and 
Nassar survivor Simone Biles 

commented on the situation, 
tweeting, “unbelievable...../this 
is the type of stuff that makes me 
sick to my stomach/I hope the 
school is taking the proper mea-
surements in investigating this...”
 The larger problem here isn’t 
what Psi Upsilon did, but the fact 
that this isn’t an isolated incident. 
Three of Michi-
gan’s biggest rivals 
— Michigan State, 
Penn State and 
Ohio State — have 
recently had large-
scale sexual mis-
conduct scandals. 
And during rivalry 
weeks, you don’t 
have to look far to 
find examples of 
this same kind of 
behavior.
 There are the 
people who sell 
shirts outside 
the Union that 
say, “Liar, liar, 
Urban Meyer.” 
The person who 
commented on a 
“Michigan State respekt thread” 
on a popular Michigan blog say-
ing, “+1 for less sexual assault.” 
The tweets about not letting Ohio 
State’s record against Michigan 
distract from the Urban Meyer 
and Zach Smith scandal, like 
those two things are remotely 
equitable.
 Turn on any edition of “College 
GameDay” and you’ll see signs 
making light of rivals’ scandals. 
When GameDay was in South 
Bend last year for Notre Dame’s 
game against the Wolverines, one 
fan held up a sign that said, “I had 

a better sign, but Urban Meyer 
covered it up.” It’s not just Michi-
gan fans who do this, either.
 Those behaviors aren’t as public 
and perhaps not as immediately 
repulsive as what Psi Upsilon did. 
But they’re just as problematic, 
because in weaponizing these 
scandals — these failures that 
hurt hundreds of people — peo-
ple minimize them.
 “It minimizes the actual vio-
lence that they’re talking about 
in turning it into a taunt,” said 
Jessica Luther, an author and 
journalist who has covered sex-
ual violence in college athletics 
extensively. “What we’re actually 
talking about is violence and 
harm and often trauma. … It min-
imizes and even ignores that this 
is actual violence and that there 
are people in the stands who are 
fans that have to hear this stuff 
and are definitely victims of it 
and are watching that minimiza-
tion of it.”
 When you hold up a scandal 
such as Nassar’s alongside rivalry 
jokes like “94 yards,” the number 
the Spartans gained against the 
Wolverines in 2018, this is the 
message you’re sending: All of 
this is just a game. Michigan is 
better than Michigan State, not 
just because of those on-field 
results, but because the Wolver-
ines don’t have a public scandal 
involving a serial sexual abuser.
 But here’s the thing: There’s a 
reason the Spartans and Buck-
eyes are the Wolverines’ biggest 
rivals. It’s because, as much as 
Michigan fans hate to admit it, 
the three schools are similar in 
culture and demographic. If it 
happened at Michigan State and 

Ohio State, who is to say it won’t 
happen here?
 And, while Michigan’s never 
had a scandal on the level of 
those other schools, it was just 
five years ago that it came out 
that then-kicker Brendan Gib-
bons had been expelled from the 
school in 2014 for a sexual assault 
that had happened four years ear-
lier. It had taken the university 
that long to handle the case, and 
all that time Gibbons had a prom-
inent role on the football team.
 “(I feel) just kind of this fear, 
and maybe this is not justified 
… but I always think, ‘OK, if this 
happens at Michigan, or if some 
horrible, terrible person does 
this to people at Michigan, how 
will these same people react?’ ” 
said Anjuli Shah, a Michigan fan 
and alum who has volunteered 
with domestic violence shelters. 
“I hope they’ll react in the same 
way. I hope they’ll start admon-
ishing the administration and 
calling for all of these people to 
get fired, but there’s fear inside 
me that maybe they won’t, and 
maybe this is just another sports 
thing.”
 There’s a reason so many 
survivors of sexual violence don’t 
come forward, especially when 
athletes are involved. Nassar sur-
vivors tried to tell Michigan State 
and USA Gymnastics adminis-
trators about their abuse. Those 
administrators did nothing and 
kept enabling their abuse, kept 
valuing the money and medals 
pouring in above all else.
 When ex-Ohio State wide re-
ceivers coach Zach Smith’s wife 
came forward about her abuse, 
she had her character questioned. 

It came out that then-coach 
Urban Meyer had known about 
the violence, but it was only after 
public pressure that Smith was 
fired. Meyer was put on adminis-
trative leave but missed just three 
games — the equivalent of a slap 
on the wrist.
 The fact is, something like that 
could happen here. The Gibbons 
incident is proof of that.
 “I just hate the idea that you’re 
going to make fun of another 
institution for this issue without, 
especially if you think that’s be-
cause your institution is flawless 
and perfect, because it isn’t,” Lu-
ther said. “There are absolutely 
sexual assault survivors at Mich-
igan, just statistically, that’s really 
true, and it’s statistically true that 
some of the people who harm are 
athletes. Some of the people who 
get harmed are athletes.
 “I don’t know if there’s a right 
way to respond to another school, 
I just think you should always 
be thinking about the place that 
you’re in, that you’re definitely 
standing near a survivor of sexual 
assault, almost all the time when 
you’re in public, and that’s gonna 
be as true at your school as it is at 
the other school.”
 By making these allegations just 
another item in the rivalry, what 
you’re really doing is reinforcing 
the idea that sports are most 
important. When horrible, un-
thinkable things happen to rivals, 
fans’ first instinct is to turn it into 
another reason their program is 
better. Instead of thinking about 
how to help the victims or — 
better yet — how to ensure these 
things don’t happen in the future, 
they reinforce the very culture 

that causes this to happen.
 Michigan State kept Nassar 
around for so long because it 
didn’t want to admit it had hired 
an abuser. The Spartans covered 
up sexual assaults by their 
athletes, and the Buckeyes hired 
Smith, because those people 
made their on-field product 
better and that was the thing fans 
cared about.
 This is a culture problem above 
all, one that permeates through-
out the sports landscape. Fans 
scamper to weaponize anything 
that suggests their team is better.
 So, the next time you consider 
bringing up Zach Smith or Larry 
Nassar to a fan of one of those 
other schools, think about this: 
one in five women will be victims 
of sexual assault at some point 
in their lives, according to the 
National Sexual Violence Re-
source Center. Picture Michigan 
Stadium, packed to the brim, 
111,000 fans in maize and blue. 
Statistically, thousands of women 
in that stadium — and many men, 
too — are or will be survivors.
 Instead of jumping to the 
low-hanging fruit, think about 
them. Then, find another insult.
 The Spartans’ 94 yards. The 
Buckeyes’ 49-20 loss to Purdue. 
Michigan State’s blown 28-3 lead 
against Illinois. The fact that 
Ohio State tried to trademark the 
word “the.”
 While the chippiness of rival-
ries is part of the fun, there are 
some things that should be off 
limits. This is one of them.

Michigan hockey uses tackling
dummies to mimic game conditions

 To open practice Monday 
afternoon, player development 
coach Steve Shields skated onto 
the ice at Yost Arena dragging 
two figures by the arms as 
he skated onto the ice. It was 
the second time in two weeks 
Shields was tasked with setting 
up this surprise drill for the 
players.
 He struggled, but eventually 
managed to bring the objects 
out from behind the bench 
all the way to the block M at 
center ice. 
 And the effort was worth it 
because Shields loves this type 
of drill. Standing on the ice 
next to Shields were two blue 
tackling dummies — the latest 
addition to the Wolverines’ 
team.
 While all the players were 
in the locker room getting 
dressed for practice, Shields 
was preparing the ice. When 
he was finished, it resembled 
something you’d be more likely 
to see at a Michigan football 
practice.
 At each end of the ice, 20 
feet in front of the net, he 
positioned the dummies in 
the center of the zone. Their 
purpose was twofold — provide 
a screen for the goaltender and 
block the direct zone entry for 
the offensive player.
 When the Wolverines took 
the ice, Shields and other 
coaches took their positions be-
hind the tackling dummies. As 
a skater brought the puck into 
the zone, a coach pushed the 

dummy in its direction, forcing 
the player to change directions.
 “We did that last year,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“We’ve done it a couple times 
this year. It’s just to help in our 
shooting drills, you can’t just 
come straight down the ice and 
not have to think. This way you 
have to get your head up and 
make a move. Just change your 
angle a little bit and not come 
straight in on the goalie while 
he stands there just shot after 
shot.” 
 For the team, the dummies 
offer a nice change of pace. 
Rather than just skating with 
the puck and firing a shot from 
the top of the faceoff circle, the 
players have to think of their 
feet. The drill forces quick 
shots from less than perfect 
angles.
 Senior forward Nick Pastujov 
enjoys how the tackling dum-
mies create small, awkward 
spaces and force creativity 
to move the puck around the 
obstacle and to the net.
 “It gets you going,” Pastujov 
said. “Gets you thinking a little 
quicker. It’s nice on Monday 
when we’re doing a little less 
team stuff (and more individ-
ual). Get your hands going. 
It’s nice to get you working 
on some skills that you don’t 
normally do.”
 Beyond requiring Michigan to 
be creative offensively and play 
with more speed and urgency, 
the tackling dummies make 
practice conditions more like 
what the players experience in 
games. 
 Mimicking game scenarios is 
something Pearson has strongly 

pushed for in the midst of the 
offensive slump his team has 
experienced. The Wolverines 
have to learn how to take what 
they do in practice and use it in 
the game. They have to bring 
that same level of energy and 
creativity they’ve exhibited 
with the tackling dummies.
 “In a game, you’re not just 
going to walk into the slot and 
shot it,” said senior forward 
Will Lockwood. “There’s going 
to be a body in front of you. It 
definitely makes it more game-
like, and for those situations 
to occur in practice so in the 
games it doesn’t surprise us as 
much.”
 Last weekend against New 
Hampshire, Michigan exhib-
ited some of the exact skills 
that working with the tackling 
dummies pushes it to use. On 
the power play, there was more 
creativity. The passes were pur-
poseful. The shots were quick 
and from off-center angles. 
 And it paid off — for the first 
time in seven games, the Wol-
verines won.
 But even with last weekend’s 
success, Pearson still wishes 
he’d thought to use the tackling 
dummies earlier in the season 
before Michigan fell to last 
place in the Big Ten and hit an 
offensive slump. 
 There are still two weeks 
remaining in the first half of 
the season, plenty of time for 
the Wolverines to continue im-
plementing the skills acquired 
from their new drill. The 
biggest question is whether 
they’ll remember what they’ve 
learned in practice come game 
time.

Collins sure to play major
role in Ohio State gameplan

 Joe Milton dropped back a 
full 10 yards beyond the line 
of scrimmage, rolled slight-
ly to his right and let it fly. 
The game was deep into the 
recesses of garbage time by 
that point, with Ohio State 
putting any intrigue about the 
outcome to rest long before. 
 So Milton had a go, flinging 
the ball 50 yards downfield. 
 That play, to the extent it 
even registers as a memory, is 
recalled for a glimpse into the 
arm strength of the then-red-
shirt freshman quarterback 
last season. Perhaps a bare-
bones hint of a bright future.
 On the other end of that 
dart was a 6-foot-4 receiv-
er, leaping over an awaiting 
safety, with another defensive 
back draped by his side. Nico 
Collins got up, tossed the ball 
back to the referee and quick-
ly shook his head.
 What was understood, and 
need not be said: Where was 
that in the 55-plus minutes 
prior?
 Fast forward a year, and 
it seems Michigan would 
be remiss not to learn that 
lesson, as it faces the tall 
task of knocking off the 
second-ranked Buckeyes. 
Collins, coming off the best 
game of his career last week 
at Indiana, will almost surely 
be an outsized part of the 
gameplan — presumably, 
before it’s too late.
 “Last year, it didn’t end 

well, like we wanted it to,” 
Collins said Monday. “And 
ever since that loss, we don’t 
want to have that feeling 
again. So throughout the 
offseason, our main focus was 
to not have that feeling again. 
We take it very personal 
throughout this whole build-
ing. And it’s that week.”
 Even in a game that will fea-
ture future NFL talent up and 
down the field, Collins’ skill-
set will stick out. Ohio State 
will likely line up cornerback 
Jeff Okudah on Collins for 
the majority of the game. 
Okudah, for all his merits, 
will be at a three-to-four inch 
size disadvantage.
 Collins, coming off a mon-
strous six-catch, 165-yard, 
three-touchdown outing 
against Indiana will be out for 
more in the most important 
game of his career to date.
 “A dude of (Collins’) size 
probably puts fear in a lot 
of cornerback’s hearts,” said 
senior tight end Nick Eu-
banks. “And one thing about 
Saturday is, I think he’ll do 
way better than what he did 
last week.
 “To me, I think it’s catch-
ing everything and blocking 
everything. Most people don’t 
see it, but he’s a big, mean 
dude. In terms of getting 
what he wants and getting 
what he needs. I think he’ll 
come through for us Satur-
day.”
 Collins’ ascension comes as 
the Wolverines’ offense has 
discovered an identity befit-
ting of the “speed in space” 

mantra that offensive coordi-
nator Josh Gattis espouses. In 
the past six weeks, Michigan 
has averaged over 38 points 
per game — spearheaded by a 
potent passing attack.
 His breakout game last 
weekend comes after a per-
formance against Michigan 
State that saw Collins reach 
the end zone on a 22-yard 
post route, when he elevated 
over a smaller defensive back, 
making a contested catch 
appear routine.
 “He’s catching the contest-
ed balls as well as you can,” 
said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “Drawn a lot of 
pass interference penalties. 
There’s times where they’ve 
got to grab him because he’s 
behind them, so he’s getting 
behind them, getting separa-
tion on defensive backs and in 
the secondary.”
 To Harbaugh’s point, Col-
lins’ nine pass interference 
penalties drawn are good for 
tops in the nation, according 
to Pro Football Focus. Most of 
those calls have come on deep 
passes, as a desperate corner 
cuts his losses with the ball 
in the air. All year, he’s been 
a viable outlet when the 
offense has needed a big play 
down the field.
 Ahead of a game that might 
just be Collins’ last in a Mich-
igan uniform, it would stand 
to reason he’ll be a focal point 
of an aggressive offensive 
gameplan. Perhaps he’ll even 
get those chances before the 
game’s dying embers render 
any big plays meaningless.
