Since the first cases of the novel 

coronavirus 
(COVID-19) 
were 

confirmed in Michigan last week, 

doctors and hospital officials at 

Michigan Medicine have begun 

preparing for a steep increase in 

cases as the virus spreads. 

There are 65 confirmed cases 

of 
COVID-19 
in 
Michigan 
as 

of Tuesday, including seven in 

Washtenaw County. 

Shortly after the first two cases 

of the virus in the state were 

announced on March 10, Michigan 

Medicine confirmed it was treating 

one of the patients. 

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, 
on 
Tuesday 
morning, 

Michigan Medicine CEO Marschall 

Runge 
said 
the 
hospital 
is 

currently caring for two confirmed 

coronavirus patients and “treating 

several patients” who are awaiting 

testing 
results. 
However, 
the 

Michigan Medicine website notes 

it will not be disclosing the current 

number of COVID-19 patients as the 

situation is rapidly evolving. 

Michigan Medicine announced 

on Monday the opening of a new 

32-bed isolation unit in order 

to handle a possible influx of 

coronavirus cases. The new unit, 

known as the Regional Infectious 

Containment Unit, will be used to 

care solely for patients diagnosed 

with COVID-19. 

Michael 
Mulholland, 
senior 

associate dean for clinical affairs at 

Michigan Medicine and executive 

director 
of 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan Medical Group, spoke 

Tuesday afternoon in a media call 

about limited curbside screening for 

Michigan Medicine patients who 

have been referred to the hospital by 

their doctors. Mulholland said there 

are now three screening centers 

available to Michigan Medicine 

employees and patients if they are 

showing symptoms.

The University of Michigan’s 

Ann Arbor campus has an eerie, 

ghostlike feel to it. 

In the past week, each day has 

come with a new blow to normalcy 

because of the coronavirus. First, 

in-person classes were canceled. 

Next came all sports competitions. 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered all 

Michigan restaurants, bars and other 

public places of accommodation to 

shut down temporarily, meaning 

that on-campus dining halls and 

libraries 
have 
closed. 
Today, 

another blow — students in dorms 

must leave unless they “truly have 

no other alternatives,” and other 

students have also been urged to 

leave campus.

The 
changes 
have 
impacted 

everyone 
in 
the 
University 

community, as well as people 

worldwide. But especially for those 

finishing their final year, the timing 

of this global pandemic could not be 

worse. On Wednesday, they attended 

classes unaware that these in-person 

meetings would be their last. They 

had to cancel large, meaningful 

events of their senior year, such as 

concerts and competitions. And 

then on Friday, March 13, University 

President Mark Schlissel sent out 

an email confirming that Spring 

Commencement was canceled.

“I probably cried for a solid 40 

minutes, and I don’t really cry. I 

wouldn’t say I’m a crier,” LSA senior 

Sydney Moore said.

Schlissel’s 
initial 
email 

contained a few sentences saying 

commencement was canceled and 

that the University “will look at 

ways to celebrate 2020 graduates in 

the future.” A follow-up email from 

Acting Provost Susan Collins and 

Interim Vice President for Student 

Life Simone Himbeault Taylor, sent 

first to parents and then to students, 

elaborated more on the decision. 

“We know that this decision 

is very upsetting for many of our 

graduates and their families. Our 

students work incredibly hard to 

reach this milestone, and those 

who earn a Michigan degree 

deserve to be celebrated with their 

friends, professors, families and 

loved ones. Commencement is one 

of our favorite times of the year, 

as well,” Collins and Himbeault 

Taylor wrote. “At the same time, 

we want commencement to be safe 

– for our graduates, the hundreds 

of employees who prepare for and 

work during the ceremonies, and 

the tens of thousands who join us 

to celebrate.”

Collins and Himbeault Taylor 

said 
the 
University 
will 
find 

another date for the Class of 2020’s 

commencement and will share that 

information as soon as possible. 

Still, an abrupt end to college 

as they know it with no May 

graduation ceremony is jarring, 

according 
to 
the 
graduating 

students 
who 
spoke 
to 
The 

Michigan Daily. They know it isn’t 

the University’s fault, and that 

canceling the ceremony is for the 

best. But for these students it’s still 

an upsetting turn of events.

Here are some of the names, faces 

and stories, in their own words, of 

the University of Michigan Class 

of 2020. Some quotes have been 

condensed for clarity.

HOUSING

All 
students 
living 
in 

University 
of 
Michigan 

residence halls must leave 

campus unless they fill out a 

request to remain in housing, 

according to an email sent 

to everyone still living on 

campus Tuesday afternoon. 

If their request is approved, 

the email notes, they are not 

guaranteed to continue their 

current housing assignment 

and may have to move to a new 

building.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 18, 2020


According to the email, 

sent 
by 
the 
University 

Housing Team, concerns 

about the spread of the 

novel coronavirus made it 

crucial for students to leave 

campus.

“New developments in 

the COVID-19 pandemic 

make it clear that now is 

the time to return home,” 

the email reads. “ ... While 

University 
Housing 
will 

ensure 
that 
we 
have 

sufficient housing available 

for 
students 
who 
truly 

have no other alternatives, 

we cannot promise that 

you will be able to remain 

in your current housing 

assignment.”

The request to stay must 

be filled out by Wednesday, 

March 18 at 8 a.m. A failure 

to respond will result in the 

University 
assuming 
the 

student has moved out and 

discontinuing access to the 

building. 

The email also noted that 

Northwood I, II, III, IV and 

V, Lawyers club and Munger 

Graduate Residences are 

exceptions 
to 
the 
rule 

students must leave unless 

they have no other option. 

This comes after Simone 

Himbeault Taylor, interim 

vice president for student 

life, sent a campus-wide 

email Monday urging all 

students to return home. 

All libraries and gyms on 

campus have been closed, 

while dining hall usage has 

been reduced to take-out 

only.

Additionally, 
Gov. 

Gretchen 
Whitmer 
put 

into effect an executive 

order on Monday closing 

performance 
venues, 

movie theaters, libraries, 

museums 
and 
bars, 
in 

addition 
to 
banning 

on-premise consumption at 

restaurants in the state. 

Several cases of COVID-

19 have been identified in 

the University community, 

Taylor confirmed in her 

email to students.

“There 
are 
several 

confirmed 
cases 
within 

our 
community, 
dozens 

of others remain under 

evaluation, 
and 
many 

others have been placed in 

quarantine as a result of 

exposure,” Taylor wrote. 

“And these numbers are 

growing daily.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Isaac 

Bigsby lives in Couzens 

Hall. He was originally 

planning on moving out 

this weekend but now has 

to expedite his move-out 

process in light of this 

email. 

“I think that was the 

real turning point in my 

decision to move out — 

when they started to get 

more serious about what’s 

going on,” Bigsby said. “And 

based on my understanding, 

looking at it, I think what 

they’re gonna do is relocate 

people and so it’d be kind of 

crazy because the one thing 

I was worried about is if I 

leave Friday, am I about to 

have to move all my stuff 

somewhere else and then 

move out again for sure, but 

I’m not too worried about 

it now since I’m leaving 

tomorrow.”

Bigsby 
said 
while 

he is able to move out 

sooner than he initially 

intended, 
not 
everyone 

has that ability. He noted 

international 
students 

may 
face 
heightened 

challenges. 

“There’s 
one 
of 
my 

hallmates who is leaving 

on Friday and is concerned. 

Are they gonna shut off 

access on Wednesday and if 

so, that’ll be a problem if he 

isn’t leaving until Friday,” 

Bigsby said. “I think there’s 

several other people that 

also don’t really have a place 

to stay. I kind of think about 

international 
students, 

where are they going to put 

their stuff if they’re forced 

to leave?”

Bigsby said he appreciates 

the University’s response 

and said the school has 

made sure everyone in the 

residence hall feels secure, 

but the previous uncertainty 

around whether students 

were supposed to stay or 

move out made it difficult 

for him to figure out what 

to do. 

2A — Wednesday, March 18, 2020
News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Despite 
a 
spate 
of 

cancellations 
across 

campus amid an outbreak of 

coronavirus, the Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization 

continued 
their 
campaign 

for a new contract with the 

University of Michigan. On 

Tuesday afternoon, more than 

80 people gathered virtually 

for a digital sit-in after the 

graduate student union and 

the University failed to reach a 

tentative agreement by March 

1. 

The 
union’s 
platform 

includes 
proposals 
related 

to sexual misconduct policy, 

climate 
change, 
housing 

and 
food 
security 
and 

disability and mental health 

accommodations.

When GEO began contract 

negotiations 
with 
the 

University’s 
administration 

last November, they called for 

expanded mental health and 

transgender health coverage 

and increasing pay equity. 

In February, GEO held a 

“grade-in” in Mason Hall to 

continue raising awareness 

about issues facing graduate 

student workers, including 

disability and mental health 

accommodations and housing 

equity, among others.

In a February interview 

with The Daily, University 

President Mark Schlissel said 

the University recognizes the 

important contributions of 

graduate student employees 

on campus and expressed his 

support for their work at the 

University.

“The graduate students are 

the lifeblood of the University, 

and we’re the biggest public 

research university in the 

country, if not the world,” 

Schlissel said. “Most of that 

research is done by our 

graduate students. They’re 

our partners in scholarship, 

they’re our successors very 

often in the academy; they’ll 

be tomorrow’s professors and 

leaders in society. So, we’re 

invested in their success.”

In a written statement to 

The Daily when bargaining 

began in November, Sascha 

Matish, associate vice provost 

for academic affairs and senior 

director of academic human 

resources, said the University 

is committed to working with 

the GEO to develop a contract 

both parties can agree upon.

Rosie 
Van 
Alsburg, 
an 

Engineering 
senior 
studying 

computer science and physics, is 

from Ann Arbor, Mich.

“I’m a transfer student so I started 

at WCC (Washtenaw Community 

College) first and then came here. I’ve 

been in college for five years.

Everything still feels fake, you 

know. I’m in a state of disbelief, like, 

‘Oh, it’s a joke. They’re going to put 

classes back in person and this is just 

a weird dream.’ But my friends are 

booking flights back to their home 

states and everything, so I know that 

it’s actually happening.

I’m the oldest grandkid on both 

sides, so I’m the first grandkid in my 

family to graduate. Both sides of my 

family were going to come in. I was 

really excited about that. I’ve just been 

in school for a very long time. This was 

supposed to be the celebration — that I 

didn’t suffer for five years for nothing.

My last year I failed a class. Six 

credits worth of class. EECS 482, 

it’s the operating systems class, it’s 

famously the hardest one in the 

department. And I failed it. I did 

really poorly, and I thought I was 

going to drop out and that was the 

end of it. It turns out, it’s okay, I came 

back from it. My GPA’s not perfect, 

but I’m still graduating. I meet all my 

requirements, and I’ve got a job lined 

up for May. So, I came back from that.”

Sydney Moore, an LSA senior 

studying Women’s Studies, is from 

Taylor, Mich.

“I am the first person in my 

family to graduate from college. And, 

obviously, we still get the degree and 

all that, but commencement and the 

graduations and celebrating with your 

friends and the department and the 

faculty you’ve built relationships with 

is something that has really motivated 

me. I hate to say that, that being here 

isn’t enough, but it’s not. 

All my family would come and 

watch me be the first to graduate. The 

hardest thing actually was calling my 

mom and telling my mom there is not 

going to be anything at all. Because 

when I called her on Wednesday when 

they canceled classes, the first and 

only thing she said to me was, ‘Please 

don’t tell me they’re going to cancel 

graduation.’ That’s all my parents have 

been waiting for, to see me graduate 

from U-M. 

I don’t want to cry, but it’s like 

— even finishing high school was 

something 
that 
felt 
impossible. 

Coming to U-M has felt — obviously 

there are things wrong with the 

institution, we all know that — but to 

come to this kind of university… this is 

not an institution that was built for me, 

the fact that I kept going even when I 

didn’t want to is like really the biggest 

thing.”

Alexandra 
Niforos, 
an 
LSA 

senior studying English, is from 

Grosse Pointe, Mich.

“I was on the phone with my friend 

who’s also a senior here and we were 

actually in the middle of canceling 

‘The Wiz’ for Musket … And then I 

got the Schlissel email, and I was like, 

‘Before we continue, commencement 

was canceled.’ We both were in shock 

… At first, I was like, ‘This might as 

well happen.’ But as soon as I was 

on the phone with my mom, I burst 

into tears and just felt overwhelming 

emotion.

I know it’s a formality but it still 

feels important — and the product 

of all your hard work is walking 

in graduation. I was thinking my 

grandparents are immigrants and 

education is so important to my 

family, I would have been their first 

granddaughter to graduate college, 

and they would have watched that 

happen. And now they don’t get that.

(I’d like) more answers about what’s 

next. I know when I read that email, I 

was so jarred that it was so minimized 

… They were like, ‘We’re looking for an 

alternative way to celebrate the class 

of 2020,’ and I said, ‘What does that 

mean?’ … It just felt like a formality 

and not like an actual solution. I 

understand why they’re doing what 

they’re doing, but for them to just leave 

us hanging with no answers, it added 

to the shock.”

Ryan Montgomery, a Business 

senior studying Human Resources 

and Music, is from Grand Haven, 

Mich.

“My older brother, he’s 31, he spent 

five years here at Michigan. So, I 

kind of grew up ever since fifth grade 

knowing I wanted to go to Michigan 

— it was the place I was going to be. I 

was going to join the Men’s Glee Club, 

I was going to graduate, I was going 

to do all this, and to have that ripped 

away, it’s really rough. It’s not a fun 

time for anybody. 

It’s been madness (being a Resident 

Adviser). Res staff in general has 

been doing a pretty good job of 

communicating. It’s been as smooth 

as it can be for these unprecedented 

times but there’s still some smaller 

aspects where it’d be nice to know that 

this is happening. What I love is the 

actual RA community, we’re really, 

really tight, so it’s been nice to have 

them to rely on. 

Being in the Men’s Glee Club is 

the reason I came to Michigan, more 

than academics, more than sports or 

anything like that. I needed to be in 

this choir. My freshman year I came 

in, joined the Glee Club, and we were 

performing this piece called ‘Seven 

Last Words of the Unarmed,’ which 

is about the last words of seven Black 

men who were shot by white police. 

And so that was a huge milestone 

for us. Supreme Court Justice Sonia 

Sotomayor reached out to us and said, 

‘Hey, I’d love to have the Glee Club 

come into my black-tie dinner party 

and perform for us.’ I was one of 20 

people chosen to fly out to D.C. and 

sing for that. That was magical. If 

there was one moment I had to boil it 

down to, it’d probably be that.

My brother got the chance to go 

on two international tours with Glee 

Club, they do them about every four 

years, so that was my big thing. I’d 

been saving up, I worked really hard 

for a Boy Scout Popcorn Scholarship, 

stuff like that, way back when I was 

young. I was always working my 

whole life to go on an international 

tour, and then to hear that our spring 

concert for this year and international 

tour for this year was canceled, it’s 

devastating. It’s an absolute bombshell 

to all the seniors and all the graduating 

folks who this was going to be their 

last time.”

Desi Dikova, an LSA senior 

studying 
Chemistry 
and 

Interdisciplinary Physics with a 

minor in Energy Science and Policy, 

is from Farmington Hills, Mich.

“Canceling commencement was 

absolutely in the best interests of 

protecting our most vulnerable. Of 

course, we can rationalize it all day 

long and still feel hurt. 

As a low-income, first-generation 

college 
student, 
attending, 
let 

alone graduating, college is a huge 

accomplishment. This meant so much 

to me and my family. I was most 

looking forward to Al Gore’s speech 

at commencement and participating 

in the Spectrum Center’s Lavender 

Graduation for LGBT+ students. I was 

also looking forward to SWAM club 

swim’s end-of-the-year formal and 

banquet. I’ve been with SWAM for 

the past four years. Not being able to 

say goodbye to my beloved teammates, 

the people who have meant the most 

to me, is the biggest disappointment. 

It’s jarring and shocking that none of 

it will happen. 

I’m most proud of myself for 

starting the Chemistry Inclusivity 

Initiative with the American Chemical 

Society club this year. We hosted guest 

faculty, ran a mentorship program 

and launched a podcast series about 

the intersection of social identities 

and the sciences. It’s been incredibly 

rewarding to develop diversity and 

inclusivity initiatives that I would’ve 

wanted when I was first starting 

college. What we leave behind is 

so much greater than any school-

wide, department or extracurricular 

ceremony can recognize.”

Vijita Kamath, a Business senior 

studying 
Math 
and 
Business 

Administration, is from Mumbai, 

India.

“I was extremely upset because I’m 

also in the process of immigrating, so 

I don’t get to go home. I’m essentially 

stuck in the U.S., and I thought I would 

see my dad for a conference which was 

happening next weekend, but that got 

canceled. And he’s like, ‘Oh well, never 

mind. I’ll come for commencement.’ 

And now that’s also gone, so I haven’t 

seen my family in two years, which 

makes me sad.

I was looking forward to seeing my 

family the most and since I’m a fifth-

year senior just finally being able to 

validate it and get it all done, because 

it’s been a long five years of college.

My sophomore year my mother 

passed away, and I was stuck in the 

same immigration dilemma then too, 

so being home was a really stressful 

time. One thing I was bummed about 

then was that my mother doesn’t get to 

see me graduate. And now it’s like both 

my parents don’t, and I’m the only 

child and an international student and 

first-gen so that was one thing that 

I was really sad about. But I’m also 

glad that I was able to overcome that, 

be able to graduate with two degrees 

instead of one, which makes me really 

proud and be involved with all the 

extracurriculars I do in my life.

A delayed date would be really 

helpful or just telling us how they’d 

accommodate us if we walked in the 

December commencement activities 

that happen for Fall 2020 grads. In 

terms of them telling us that they 

made accommodations so when we 

start our jobs, giving us a date so 

we can leave and walk and be back 

with our friends to celebrate, giving 

us travel accommodations would 

be really helpful. Or just an online 

address from professors, deans, even if 

we can’t congregate.”

Jackie Berger, an LSA senior 

studying Political Science, is from 

West Bloomfield, Mich.

“I was looking forward to hearing 

former Vice President Al Gore as our 

commencement speaker. My family 

has been insanely unlucky in terms of 

our commencement speakers. I have 

two older siblings that both graduated 

from the University of Michigan also. 

My older sister was part of the Class of 

2015. Their commencement speaker 

was originally NBC news anchor 

Brian 
Williams. 
The 
University, 

however, had to cancel him as speaker 

because Williams was caught in a 

scandal after making up a story while 

covering the war in Iraq. My older 

brother was part of the class of 2017, 

which as some of you may know 

was the year of the infamous video 

montage 
commencement 
speech. 

My brother refused to show up to his 

commencement ceremony, so none of 

us did as well. My family was looking 

(forward to) finally having a classic 

Big House commencement with a 

well-known speaker, only to have this 

commencement fall through on us as 

well. 

I was also looking forward to having 

my family all together for the first time 

in years. My parents are divorced and 

both of my siblings have since moved 

away to begin their professional lives 

in Chicago. Since my older brother 

was not at his commencement as I 

had mentioned, the last time that the 

five members of my family were all 

together at the same place at the same 

time was my high school graduation 

back in 2016. This May was going to be 

the first time that both my parents and 

both my siblings would all be together, 

but now I’m not sure what the future 

holds. 

This past semester, I have actually 

been away from Ann Arbor. I am 

finishing my UMich degree remotely 

from New York City with an amazing 

internship that I got at The Tonight 

Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. I 

was looking forward to flying in 

commencement weekend and seeing 

all of my friends in-person in Ann 

Arbor while we prepared to graduate. 

I was looking forward to catching up 

with them on everything that we’ve 

been up to this past semester while I 

was away.”

Hasan Ali, a Rackham student 

studying Electrical Engineering, is 

from Karachi, Pakistan.

“It was the biggest bummer that I’ve 

ever seen. Honestly, it had me down. 

One thing that I was really looking 

forward to this whole academic year 

was the graduation itself. That’s the 

capstone of your whole journey. And 

for me that was something that when 

coming to the U.S., before I started 

my master’s, was an achievement or 

dreamlike moment, when it’s like the 

gown and the cap, and the family’s 

going to be there and then you get 

to graduate. It’s just an all-around 

amazing feeling. It hit me like a bus, 

like, ‘Oh my God, I’m never going to be 

able to experience that.’

When 
you 
come 
from 
an 

international country, the work ethic 

and the way things are in the U.S. is 

quite different from what it was for 

me back home. Getting in tune with 

that for the first semester was a hassle. 

I could not tell what was happening, 

I was all over the place. Things and 

logistics and the way people treat 

you and the way you’re supposed to 

go about things is also very different. 

Grasping that and getting yourself in 

line with that and second semester 

onwards, actually enjoying that, was a 

big achievement I would say. It gives 

you a new experience and perspective 

and honestly that’s one thing I’ve 

really taken away from this masters.

I like to play sports a lot — all of 

that has stopped. I was playing two 

leagues in the recreational sports 

league, the IM league. Soccer’s my 

go-to thing. That was something I 

would look forward to week in week 

out, and right now that’s all stopped 

so … it’s a different lifestyle right now. 

For these moments to be taken 

away, it kind of feels like you’ve been 

cheated. But at the same time, I do 

understand that it was a need of the 

time. But at the same time, you’re like, 

‘Oh my God, why me?’”

Lillie Heyman, a Public Policy 

senior studying Women’s Equity 

Policy, is from Florham Park, N.J.

“I sobbed within seconds. It’s 

almost tragic, in the most dramatic 

way. Ceremonies are really important 

to me. I’m someone who has a hard 

time with change, so for me in a 

transitional period as momentous 

as finishing 16 years of school and 

finishing college at the University of 

Michigan, I wanted that ceremony. 

For its symbolism, for the sentimental 

aspect of it, and just for a second be 

proud of all the work we’ve been 

doing together. 

All of the different ‘lasts’ that you 

have in the last month of school — 

your last time hanging out with your 

friends, your last time going to certain 

places, your last time being in the 

Big House, hearing all your friends’ 

names being read. In Ford, there’s 

only 80 of us, so we’ve all gotten pretty 

close, and having a Ford graduation 

too, together, is really important. 

Closing everything out in a symbolic 

way is really important. It happened 

so abruptly, I didn’t get to have the 

different lasts that people talk about 

and that I wanted very dearly.

I’m heavily involved in Dance 

Marathon, and I was looking forward 

to my big achievement being this 

year’s VictorThon. Its in-person 

form got canceled unfortunately, 

so we’re doing some kind of virtual 

VictorThon instead, but I was really 

looking forward to that 24-hour event 

and playing a large role in it. So, that’s 

also something I have to grapple with 

and work through my emotions as 

well. 

It’s 
unfortunate, 
the 

circumstances, because you almost 

think that we don’t have a right to 

be upset about these things because 

people are getting really sick, people 

are dying, and it’s a really hard topic. 

And it seems almost selfish to be upset 

about something like this, but I think 

we have a right to feel our emotions, 

and it’s important that we feel these 

emotions and important that we talk 

about them and process them and not 

feel bad about feeling this way.”

Victoria Li, an LSA senior 

studying 
Economics, 
is 
from 

Canton, Mich.

“Oddly, I was shocked and not 

surprised at the same exact time. 

I remember being on the phone 

with a friend just 30 minutes prior 

to the official announcement of the 

cancellation of commencement. It 

honestly still feels surreal. My heart 

hurts, a lot. One moment I was a 

senior with a significant portion of 

my time in undergrad left. The next 

moment, the entire period between 

Spring Break and graduation was 

canceled, and I suddenly found myself 

having to say goodbye to some of the 

people who I’ve seen every day for the 

past few years.

T

he 
drawbacks 
of 
social 

distancing 
can 
include 

loneliness, reduced productivity 

and loss of health benefits associated with 

human interaction. Happy hours, fitness 

classes, traveling and football games 

activate the body’s senses and make for 

a pleasant experience — so much so that 

people crave and seek out more of these 

interactions. So when left to our own 

resources, many are wondering, “How 

can we handle social distancing?”

According to the Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention, social distancing 

is necessary to reduce the probability 

of contact between persons carrying 

an infection and others who are not 

infected. Bottom line: By staying home 

you reduce the risk of becoming infected 

with COVID-19 and then unknowingly 

infecting others.

Not all people will experience the 

stress of this outbreak in the same way. 

The common ground is the shared 

responsibility to contain coronavirus in 

our communities. Worried or not, now is 

not the time to carry on like normal.

Many of us are scared, anxious, tired 

and sad. Take comfort in knowing this 

will pass and the drawbacks of social 

distancing are temporary. Use the time 

wisely to connect with yourself and come 

out the other side stronger. Right now, 

self-care is your health care; do as much 

as you can.

Be sure to be self-shielding: Being 

within six feet of someone who is sick 

can get you and your personal space 

contaminated with COVID-19. Now is 

the time to overindulge in screen time to 

completely avoid respiratory droplets of 

others when we talk, sneeze and cough 

— these can land on surfaces or in your 

mouth or nose. Skype or FaceTime your 

friends and conduct meetings over video 

conferencing platforms.

Prepare 
meals 
at 
home: 
Gov. 

Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive 

order on Monday closing all Michigan 

restaurants and bars. There is no 

antibiotic 
(they 
are 
designed 
for 

bacterial infections, not viral ones like 

the novel coronavirus) to treat COVID-

19. Scientists are already working on a 

vaccine, but they don’t expect to have a 

good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the 

earliest. It’s best to stock up on groceries 

for a two-week period of time, and 

prepare all meals at home. Use this time 

to fuel on healthy foods — avoid sugar, 

salt and white flour — to keep your 

immune system strong.

Work out at home: Thirty minutes 

is the magic number when it comes to 

reaping the benefits of exercise. Doing 

a workout that is out of your typical 

routine will challenge your body and 

keep your mind active. Find a workout 

video online and get your family 

involved. Utilize your backyard for 

breaks and a few laps to stretch your 

body.

Wash your hands: Twenty seconds of 

scrubbing. Do this often, and be careful 

about maintaining good hand-washing 

and cleaning of high-touch surfaces like 

doorknobs and countertops. Remind 

yourself not to touch your face.

Self-care is your health care: Ask 

yourself: What do you like to do? Avoid 

sedentary habits in the home — instead 

tackle home projects and organization. 

Read books, do journaling activities 

— anything you can do to set up your 

comeback when self-isolation is no longer 

recommended. Channel the creativity 

inside of you — keep pushing through. 

Are you doing all that you can?

How to cope with social isolation

A

s the iconic piano riff 

began to play, my mom, 

grandma and I looked at 

each other with excited grins. With 

the lights of metropolitan Denver 

twinkling over the stage, Dolly 

Parton belted out “9 to 5.” Seeing 

Parton perform the song alongside 

my mom, who worked her way 

through college as a single mother 

and her mother, who worked at 

Wendy’s for decades until retiring, 

made the song’s anti-corporate, pro-

woman message hit even harder. 

We danced and sang along with the 

thousands of other people nestled 

between the stunning megaliths 

of Red Rocks. A lifelong memory, 

it wouldn’t be the only one set to 

Parton’s underdog anthem.

After waiting for four hours in 

Detroit’s Eastern Market, the same 

piano riff blared throughout the 

room. Like in Colorado, the notes 

brought an ecstatic smile to my 

face as presidential candidate Sen. 

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ran 

onto the stage. The room erupted 

in screams as she gave the woman 

who introduced her, state Sen. 

Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, a 

typical, big Warren hug. After a year 

of supporting and campaigning for 

her, I couldn’t believe my political 

icon was right in front of me. 

Attacking corruption and corporate 

greed with the fervor and agility 

only she has, Parton’s jingle felt 

tailor-made for Warren’s speech.

The overflowing excitement I 

felt from the rally hadn’t dissipated 

by 
the 
time 
Super 
Tuesday 

results trickled in later that night. 

Eventually, though, the excitement 

began to sour. My mother, who had 

registered to vote after attending 

a Warren rally in Denver, called 

me to vent her frustration with a 

Democratic Party that was readily 

denying a woman nominee. While I 

tried my best to cultivate optimism 

with California’s vote yet to be 

counted, a few hours later I had 

joined her in her anger.

Two 
days 
later, 
Warren 

suspended 
her 
campaign 
for 

president, narrowing the field 

down to two very old and very 

white men, former Vice President 

Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, 

I-Vt. Women across the country 

expressed their disappointment. 

Rachel Maddow told Warren that 

her leaving the race felt like a “death 

kneel” to see a female president in 

her lifetime while U.S. Rep. Nancy 

Pelosi, D-Calif., complained about 

being the most powerful woman in 

the U.S. government. I also couldn’t 

help but feel my once overwhelming 

excitement for the primary fall to 

the wayside. Beginning as the most 

diverse field in either party’s history, 

I couldn’t believe that in Tuesday’s 

Democratic primary I was being 

forced to vote for a white dude. As 

a liberal, it’s no surprise that I voted 

for Sanders, but unlike many of my 

classmates, I did so without any 

enthusiasm. While I wish I could 

see Sanders as a liberal beacon 

of hope, I can’t help but see his 

potential presidency as a looming 

disappointment.

Known for his crotchetiness, 

Sanders’s temper, exhibited by 

his constant yelling and hatred 

of criticism, is only matched by 

Biden’s, who famously called a 

young woman a “lying dog-faced 

pony soldier” for asking a question. 

Compared to ex-candidates in the 

race whose communication with 

voters 
encouraged 
productive 

dialogue, these two despise the 

questioning of them or their plans. 

With the most ambitious left-wing 

platform in modern history, this will 

likely come back to haunt Sanders’s 

presidency.

A politician for almost his entire 

adult life, Sanders is beloved for his 

admirable consistency on the issues 

that are now the centerpieces of 

his campaign. Sanders’ supporters 

tout his decades-long unwavering 

stances as proof he won’t flip-flop 

as president. In order to fulfill his 

promises, however, Sanders plans 

to do just that: Changing his views 

on the issue of executive power, 

a philosophy that he opposed 

as a congressman. His team has 

already drafted dozens of executive 

orders for his presidency to bypass 

Congress on issues like immigration 

reform, 
the 
environment 
and 

legalizing marijuana. While this 

proves he plans to make good on his 

promises, it’s a bad way to go about 

doing so.

Executive orders, while effective 

at enacting short-term changes 

during a president’s administration, 

will fail to solve the problems they 

address. Easily repealed by future 

presidents, any structural change, 

which most of his plans require, 

must be accomplished through 

the creation of permanent 

solutions codified by law. President 

Donald Trump’s repealing of the 

Obama administration’s executive 

order that created Deferred Action 

for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), 

leaving the futures of thousands of 

“dreamers” in limbo, exemplifies 

why unilateral executive action is a 

sub-par strategy. This is one reason 

his presidency won’t be the liberal 

heyday his supporters anticipate. 

While it’s reasonable to argue 

executive orders are a necessary 

evil to bypass Mitch McConnell’s 

lame-duck Senate, Bernie’s path 

to the nomination has entailed 

burning more than just Republican 

bridges.

While Sanders has publicly 

denounced the toxic “Bernie Bro” 

culture that is known for sexist and 

sometimes dangerous attacks on 

fellow Democrats, his actions don’t 

align with his words. Sanders, as 

well as other top officials in his 

campaign, have all sat down for 

interviews with the pro-Sanders 

podcast “Chapo Trap House.” 

Calling themselves part of the 

“dirtbag left,” the show is infamous 

for spouting off the same viciously 

insensitive remarks Sanders claims 

to denounce. With an agenda that 

will require at least unity amongst 

Democrats, 
Sanders’s 
unique 

inability to stop his supporters 

from attacking strong women 

like those who raised me was yet 

another reason I didn’t “feel the 

Bern” at the ballot box.

I used to tumble out of bed and 

stumble to the kitchen before class 

each morning and scroll through 

my phone’s newsfeed, optimistic 

that Democrats would not only beat 

Trump in November but would do 

so using the same woman-power 

that won us back the House in 2018. 

Now, my morning ritual inspires 

more sadness than hope. I want 

Bernie’s left-wing revolution to 

seize the White House, don’t get 

me wrong, but I’m disappointed the 

glass ceiling Hillary Clinton began 

to chip at more than a decade ago 

still has yet to shatter. While this 

election may have been heavily 

influenced by the boogeyman in 

the White House, hopefully in four 

years the nominee will be chosen 

based on their qualifications rather 

than their gender.

Why I can’t feel the Bern ... no matter how hard I try

Regularly, I find myself yearning to 

be out in the woods. Whether it’s the 

stereotypical “call of the wild” or a 

deeply poetic passion for the natural, 

being among the trees has always been 

a rather important form of respite for 

me. It’s a place where sitting on a mossy 

stump doing nothing in particular is a 

productive action. Over the years, this 

urge 
has 

only 
gotten 

more 
potent. 

I 
started 
to 

convince 

myself 
that 

trail-running 

is 
the 
only 

form 
of 

exercise 
I 

actually enjoy. 

I really began 

to 
appreciate 

the 
tiny 

nuances, 
one 

being 
the 

interaction 

between 

the 
trees. 
I 

would 
notice 

the way the 

wind brushes 

the 
leaves 
and 
envision 
the 
trees 

communicating in some discreet waving 

pattern, like flag signals. In a way, I 

started to see the woods as a connected 

group. And if Conference of Trees is any 

indication, it appears as though German 

composer Pantha Du Prince may share 

my belief that nature holds a collective 

power.

Conference of Trees finds Pantha Du 

Prince continuing down the path of 

using more organic instrumentation, 

but perhaps with more intention and 

effectiveness than ever before. The 

project starts out with the soft hums of 

wood chimes and low groaning strings 

(reminiscent of Stars of the Lid), setting 

up the earthen mood and atmosphere 

for the rest of the album. Over time, 

wooden percussion hits appear, slowly 

progressing with more aggression and 

rhythm. All of this evokes imagery of 

the album’s namesake. Roughly the first 

40 minutes of the album run together 

so unimpeded that it could easily be 

mistaken for a single track. On its own, it 

could be considered ambient; in context 

with the whole album, it acts as the 

pregame to the party that is the second 

half.

The album progresses by taking on a 

more direct tone. Songs become more beat 

driven and dance inspired. For many, this 

may feel like a bit of a departure from the 

way the album starts, but fluidity is one 

of Conference of Trees’s greatest assets 

— it never feels abrupt. Pantha wants 

to look at nature both organically and 

synthetically, yet impressively neither 

aspect feels all 

that forced. He 

walks the line 

between 
the 

two with deft 

precision. 
As 

a 
result, 
the 

reverie of trees 

conversing 
is 

never 
broken. 

If 
anything, 

the 
album 

depicts 
how 

the interaction 

of 
the 
trees 

changes 
over 

time. It starts 

out subtly and 

then gets more 

prominent 

until 
it 

dominates 

the forest, only to fade away into the 

background. Conference of Trees acts in 

the same way as nature: a cycle. 

When I listen to this album, I can’t 

help but think of a forest in Utah called 

Pando. Walking through, it would seem 

like a simple amber aspen grove. Beneath 

the surface is where it gets interesting. 

The forest itself is actually just one tree, 

connected underground by a network of 

fungal roots. The woods itself becomes a 

single organism, able to send a message 

from one trunk to another even several 

acres away. It’s relieving to look at nature 

in such a way. We’re living in a world 

now where urban life and proximity to 

one another can no longer be comforting 

nor provide any security. Taking solace 

under a lonely pine or in a boysenberry 

thicket is beginning to look more like 

a necessity rather than a privilege. 

Unknowingly, Conference of Trees acts as 

a strong proponent of social distancing 

and therefore a fairly essential listen in 

these trying times. Trees are probably the 

safest thing to hug at the moment.

the hidden life of the forest

Let’s paint a picture. It’s Saturday night 

at Skeeps. Your $12 Moscow Mule pitcher 

is running dry. “Down” by Jay Sean is 

blasting on the speakers. Everyone’s 

losing it. Luckily, you lock eyes with 

that special someone from across the 

muddied dance floor. You find your way 

through the crowd and begin to hit the 

basics: Name, major, hometown, your 

least favorite President of the University 

whose last name starts with an “S.” Next 

thing you know, you’re in a Lyft back to 

their place. The two of you are violently 

making out in the back seat while your 

driver tries to politely tune you out. 

Once you get back and crash on their 

couch, they suggest watching something 

on Netflix. Perfect idea. You both scroll 

around aimlessly through titles, hoping to 

find something agreeable. Now’s a great 

opportunity for you to suggest a show 

that demonstrates just how cultured and 

cool you really are. 

“How about ‘The Office’?” 

Just then, thunderclaps emerge from 

outside. The glass in the windows shatters 

as the eyes of the person you arrived with 

begin to glow bright red. Thunder strikes 

and the wind howls throughout the room 

as you watch in horror as their head does 

a full 360-degree revolution. 

“THE OFFICE ENDED IN 2013!” they 

reply in a demonic intonation. 

“The Office” has become a symbol of 

stale viewership. In 2018, Netflix dished 

out $80 million just to keep the ’90s sitcom 

“Friends” on its platform for another 

year. And why wouldn’t they? The show 

is rewatched constantly and remains 

one of the most popular titles streamed. 

These shows have become a staple of 

entertainment for boring people. Just 

think of all of the new ideas that aren’t 

being funded as a result of continued 

audience lethargy. By comparison, in 2016, 

it only took $6 million to fund the first 

season of “Stranger Things,” a Netflix 

original that also remains one of the 

platform’s most talked about titles to date. 

Netflix has shown it has the potential to 

create engaging storylines. However, the 

disparity in funding used to rehash the 

past is remarkable. Netflix’s corporate 

strategy works best when audiences gain 

dependence on their supply of comfort 

and nostalgia. If the only thing you 

watch in 2020 happens to be “Parks and 

Recreation,” you’ll eventually become 

so trapped by the pattern of watching a 

single show that you’ll pay anything to 

keep viewing it. As users fall victim to a 

cycle of repetitive viewing, services like 

Netflix will continue to allocate a sliver 

of funding to new content.

While “The Office” and “Friends” 

are both hilarious shows (maybe not 

“Friends,” but I digress), we’ve seemed to 

reach a stalemate in a television culture 

where our fascinations are dominated by 

nostalgia. Look at the countless remakes 

and sequels that are currently dominating 

the film industry. Why bother creating 

new things if what they already have will 

still make more money? Our collective 

fixation with the past is killing not only 

TV but also entertainment in general. 

In order for any media to succeed there 

have to be new attempts at artistry, 

both good and bad. Leaving no room for 

creative growth has resulted in audiences 

feeling like we’re stuck in a job we hate, 

mindlessly selling paper and aimlessly 

hitting on the receptionist with a fiancé. 

Fortunately, there might be some 

light at the end of the tunnel. As of 

2020, “Friends” has been removed from 

Netflix and will be heading straight to 

the new streaming service HBOMax in 

May. “The Office” will be departing from 

Netflix in 2021 and is expected to draw a 

huge wave of new subscribers for NBC’s 

online service “Peacock,” which is set to 

launch on April 15th. What will these new 

streaming services mean for continued 

watchability? While it’s too early to tell, 

I’m sure viewers will find some way to 

pay an extra ten bucks a month in order 

to justify the Michael Scott sticker from 

Redbubble stuck to their laptop.

In the meantime, use the absence of 

some familiar titles to watch something 

new. Television has literally never been 

better and more diverse. Take some time 

to get a suggestion from The Daily. If 

you hate it — so what? At least you tried. 

Maybe the next time you’re hitting on 

someone at Skeeps you’ll have something 

new to talk about besides how much 

Greek life sucks.

It’s 2020: Forget ‘The Office’

There’s something to be said about the 

popularity of sports movies, a genre that has 

made its name with heartwarming tales of misfits 

working together towards miraculous wins. 

Most sports films leave the audience with a sense 

of satisfaction. You know the story: The wise 

mentor coaxes talent out of an underdog team 

of misfits and ultimately leads them to victory. 

There’s a formula to these films, and it works 

every time: “Remember the Titans,” “A League of 

Their Own,” “Hoosiers,” “Field of Dreams” and 

“Rocky,” to name a few, are crowd-pleasers even 

in their predictability.

When I entered the theater to see “The Way 

Back,” I incorrectly assumed that it would be 

a 
typical 
sports 

movie. 
To 
be 

fair, there are a 

number of classic 

sports 
movie 

elements 
present 

throughout: 

a

team,

shots. 
Director 

Gavin 
O’Connor 

(“Miracle”) is a sports movie veteran, and he 

knows how to play the genre well. But what 

sets “The Way Back” apart is its focus beyond 

basketball and into the deep humanity of 

addiction, grief and recovery.

This exploration of human resilience is 

centered around Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck, 

“Gone Girl”), a construction worker who is offered 

a job as the head coach of the Bishop Hayes High 

School’s basketball team. In high school, Jack was 

Bishop Hayes’s star player, leading his team to 

victory and multiple championships. Now, he’s an 

alcoholic who spends nights getting so drunk that 

he has to be carried home from the bar.

His coaching doesn’t follow the typical sports 

movie format. Jack is not a wise mentor or a steady 

rock for his struggling team to latch onto. He’s 

volatile and foul-mouthed, with a tendency to 

yell at referees and push people too far. His life is 

unstable, but he drinks with rhythmic ease. Still, 

Jack’s ties to the team are essential to its success; 

as the team starts winning games, his life starts 

to stabilize, his moods become more sedated and 

his drinking is less destructive. However, just 

because sports can temporarily improve life does 

not mean that they can fix it entirely. While most 

sports movies avoid this truth entirely, this is a 

fact that “The Way Back” openly acknowledges.

The ten Bishop Hayes Varsity players have 

different personalities, but are united by their love 

for the game. At first, Jack seems embarrassed by 

his team, embarrassed by their pregame dancing 

ritual and the fact that they keep losing games. 

But as time passes, he clearly starts to see himself 

in these kids. Whether he’s encouraging shy but 

talented point guard Brandon (Brandon Wilson, 

“Little Monk”) to step into a leadership position, 

or hypocritically chastising center Marcus 

(Melvin Gregg, “American Vandal”) for his vulgar 

language, he tries to help them forge a positive 

path to their future. He inspires his players with 

mantras and mentalities, asking his team the most 

important question after every game, win or lose: 

“What did we learn about ourselves last night?” 

Like most sports movies, you become quickly 

attached to the team and their success. You 

wince when the opposing team dunks savagely 

on an unprepared center. You cheer when one of 

the players sinks a three-point shot that swishes 

through the net 

with a satisfying 

whoosh. 
These 

players are not just 

a group of high 

school kids in blue 

jerseys — they’re 

your team now.

All the while, 

there is a slow 

reveal of details 

about Jack’s past, 

giving us a gradual 

understanding 
of 

the 
full 
picture. 

Jack’s struggle and hidden motivations are so 

engrossing that at times you almost forget that 

this is a movie about basketball — a feat that can be 

credited to Affleck’s performance. His execution 

is captivating, in his trembling fingers or the subtle 

slurring of his words when he is drunk. Affleck 

himself has had numerous public struggles with 

addiction and mental health in previous years, 

and has cited this project as a kind of therapy for 

him. Affleck is fully committed to the role, and 

this passion gives Jack a thrilling spark in a film 

full of muted colors and heavy themes.

Over the course of his season with Bishop 

Hayes, Jack gives the team a lot of advice, good 

and bad. At one of the first games, Jack sends 

the wrong message, encouraging his team to 

play dirty. By the end, he’s encouraging them in 

a different way, creating mantras about working 

together as a true team and playing with a chip 

on your shoulder. Watching his messages change 

is gratifying, even if it’s predictable. “All the little 

things add up,” he starts to tell his team. Rather 

than focus on the big things you can’t change, 

try to fix the small things that you can. These 

messages go beyond sports, into the realm of 

human problems that “The Way Back” navigates 

so comfortably. By the end, you don’t care as much 

about who won the playoffs as you do about what 

the players, and their imperfect coach, learned 

about themselves in the process.

‘The Way Back’ is a sports 
film without the formula

OK, so the world right now is a pretty 

dark place to live in. Political uncertainty, 

a quickly deteriorating environment and 

the current outbreak of a deadly pandemic 

have made 2020 one of the scariest years 

in recent history. With so much chaos 

compacted into a short period of time, it’s 

not hard to resign oneself to a pessimistic 

view of the future. 

Enter Generation Z. Born in the years 

between 1997 and 2012 and characterized 

by a love of memes and a distrust of 

authority, the young people that comprise 

Gen 
Z 
(occasionally 
referred 
to 
as 

“zoomers”) have grown to dominate social 

media and pop culture 

while 
also 
becoming 

increasingly 
involved 

in social issues. The 

largest, most ethnically 

diverse age group in 

the history of the U.S. 

has 
simultaneously 

disavowed 
the 

establishment 
and 

called for change with 

social 
movements 

like #NeverAgain and 

the 
March 
for 
Our 

Lives, 
in 
response 

to 
the 
numerous 

school shootings that 

have 
defined 
many 

childhoods.

Gen 
Z, 
while 

undoubtedly politically 

and 
socially 
active, 

maintains an air of nihilism that often 

earns them labels like “apathetic” or 

“spoiled.” This disconnect between their 

perception and reality may lie in Gen Z’s 

multifaceted attitude toward the future. 

That attitude, while complex and evolving 

with age, involves contradictions between 

idealism and realism, hope for progress 

and fear for the inevitable. 

The reasons for Gen Z’s unique outlook 

lie in the social, political, racial and 

cultural dynamics that define the modern 

world. While all these influences play a 

role in developing the Gen Z mindset, one 

small aspect of popular culture may serve 

as one of the best ways to describe the 

average Gen Z kid: The abundance of goth 

girls in children’s cartoons. 

While not the most highbrow media 

trend to analyze, the ubiquity of the “goth 

girl” trope in ’00s and ’10s kids’ TV may 

give insight into Gen Z’s tendency to 

appear apathetic while actually harboring 

deep empathy for those around them. This 

trope, though used since the inception of 

the goth subculture in the early 1970s, 

was most visible during the mid-2000s — 

formative years for the vast majority of 

Gen Z.

Many shows produced on popular 

children’s networks like Nickelodeon, 

Disney Channel and Cartoon Network 

feature a specific stock character of the 

goth girl with a black heart of gold. These 

characters are often presented as walking 

contradictions: Sam Manson from “Danny 

Phantom” hunts ghosts, but is a steadfast 

vegetarian; Gwen from “Total Drama 

Island” always has a sarcastic one-liner 

for her competitors, but also has the 

intelligence to make it to the faux-reality 

show’s 
finale. 
Thorn 

and the Hex Girls of the 

“Scooby-Doo” franchise 

have 
a 
witchcraft-

themed 
heavy 
metal 

band, 
yet 
care 
for 

the 
planet 
as 
self-

proclaimed “eco-goths.” 

These 
characters, 

each meant to act as 

unlikely 
protagonists 

and role models for the 

young 
audience, 
have 

two 
important 
traits 

in common: a gothic 

aesthetic 
with 
an 

uninterested 
exterior 

and a secret passion for 

supporting the people 

and causes they believe 

in. 

Gen 
Z 
viewers 

watching these goth girls take TV by storm 

were paying close attention. E-girls and 

e-boys have recently emerged as lifestyle 

trends on youth-oriented apps like TikTok, 

and memes heralding the goth women and 

men of the 2000s are all over the Internet. 

Clearly, these cartoon tropes have made 

an impact on popular culture visually, so 

the idea that they may have had a strong 

influence on Gen Z as kids may not be so 

far-fetched. 

Though cartoon goth girls only provide 

a small glimpse into the childhoods of 

this generation, analysis of this trope 

contextualizes the simple, everyday media 

messages that Gen Z grew up with. In 

understanding the actions and motivations 

of Gen Z today, it’s worth examining 

why exactly we became so hopeful and 

pessimistic. We do not exist in a vacuum — 

we did not make ourselves this way. As this 

generation ages, realizing what created us 

informs how we can move forward.

Gen Z is going goth and our 
cartoons might be the reason

M

y feet were up on the dashboard of the 
passenger seat in my roommate Kevin’s 2015 
Subaru Forester. The sun was beginning 

to set as we drove back from Atlanta. We were listening 
to a crime podcast, an iced coffee by my side. We were 
somewhere in rural Ohio, a few hours from a return to 
Ann Arbor for the final semester of college, a time that 
is supposed to be pure, unencumbered by worry, loosely 
jovial. It’s the time — the last time — to live and learn 
before reality smacks you in the face like a stiff board.

I pulled out my phone and scrolled through Twitter 

and came across an article written for the University of 
Missouri website by Wright Thompson, one of the greatest 
writers on this planet. As I was reading through the piece, 
I came across a line that blew me away.

I read it once. Paused. Took a breath. Looked up. Then I 

read it a few more times:

Sometimes it feels like we spend 45 percent of our lives 

trying to be something, 10 percent of our lives being it and 
45 percent having been it.

I thought about the prescience of reading that during 

my trip back up to Ann Arbor for the last round of the 
happiest era of my life. I thought about the call to action 
that phrase inadvertently makes: to live deliberately but 
conscientiously, to strive for more but appreciate what’s 
right there, to allow a healthy dose of nostalgia without 
letting it consume you, to appreciate who you are instead 
of obsessing over who — or what — you’d like to be. 

Thinking back to that moment now, there is a cruel 

irony in how everything has unfolded. This was supposed 
to be a self-reflective piece about the anxiety of constantly 
living in search of a destination. It was meant to be a sober 
confrontation of how we live our lives and what we value. 
I was going to delve into my personal fears about life after 
college, finding the right career and landing on my feet. I 
wanted to explore this flawed instinct we have to always 
set goals and how that breeds a lack of appreciation for the 
present. These were my primary worries no less than a 
week ago.

That irony is cruel because this past week we had our 

final moments of college ripped away from us due to the 
coronavirus outbreak: our last stretch of classes, our final 
months with friends, social gatherings, livelihoods and 
our graduation — all gone.

I have tears welled up in my eyes as I’m writing this. I 

don’t know which of my friends I’ve possibly seen for the 
last time. My family doesn’t get to come to the Big House 
and take pictures with me in my cap and gown. Instead 
of triumph, the best four years of my life are ending with 
an inauspicious, premature departure from a deserted 
campus, as I abide by an encouraged evacuation of a place 
I will always call home.

I was supposed to write this about the dichotomy of 

marrying our short-term aspirations with the macro 

visions we have for our lives. 

But sometimes, life happens.
I 

didn’t know I had anxiety 
until I came to college. I was 
dumped into a pool of 40,000 

people and was told to swim, and 
for a while I merely treaded water. 
I know I’m not alone in that — if 
anything, that makes my experience 
quite consistent with the student 
body.

I suppose that discomfort teaches 

you how to find yourself. That’s 
the only way to discover who you 
are. We must venture into that big, 
bold unknown to emerge a more 
complete person. 

These idealistic cliches are both 

true and supremely unhelpful for 
a lonely freshman searching for 
purpose. We’re told this romantic 
tale 
about 
what 
college 
was 

supposed to be and so I grew increasingly frustrated by 
the stagnation of my personal growth. Why isn’t this what 
it needs to be? My brain became flooded with thoughts 
and doubts and confusion, and that began to cripple me. 

I came to the University of Michigan knowing one 

person on campus, and even he was relatively new to 
my life. I didn’t know what I wanted to study or what I 
wanted to become. Having grown up in small, tight-knit 
communities all my life, I secretly harbored fears that I 
wouldn’t cut it outside those bubbles. I joined a fraternity 
to quell some of the lurking social anxiety I wasn’t truly 
ready to confront and I worried that Greek life would 
change who I was. I missed home. I longed, quietly and 
unassumingly, for the comforts of what I knew.

It feels peculiar, then, to be writing this next to my 

girlfriend and my four-year roommate in an off-campus 
coffee shop — completely heartbroken that, three and a 
half years later, it’s over. Just like that, it’s over. The people, 
the places, the city that made this the best four years of 
my life. All of it now lurks as a past tense in the narrative 
of my life. 

Nostalgia is healthy. But man, I just wasn’t ready for it 

yet.

Thompson’s words pierced me on that drive. They still 

do. I worry that as my peers and I strive for these high-
achieving, high-minded lives, we miss the forest for the 
trees. 

We miss the days we spent hanging out on the couch 

watching “The Bachelor” over a few beers. We miss the 
evenings in the library spent cracking jokes instead of 
studying. We miss the nights spent at 420 Maynard St., 
talking about life and University of Michigan sports and 

everything and nothing at all. We’d lose track of how many 
games of euchre we’d played and pretended to bemoan 
waking up early for our 8:30 a.m. classes the next day, as if 
we weren’t eager to do the same thing the very next night. 
We miss the road trips to far-off Big Ten cities, driving 
through the night as we played the most obscure music 
in our Spotify library — then stealing some dumb prop 
from the bowels of a football stadium and carrying it to 
the rental car like a goddamn trophy. We miss the meals 
shared. We miss the nights out. We miss those first days 
of spring after a long winter, the first day we get the “all-
clear” to wear shorts. And we’d take the grill out of the 
garage. We’d play music and toss a football. We didn’t have 
a care in the world.

Instead, we strain over internships and jobs. We 

complain about drama with friends. We bitch and moan 
and stress. Anything to get the grade. Anything to keep 
moving in a direction we’re told is “forward.” We get 
so bogged down in the stressors of a life we know to be 
brutally unpredictable.

Nothing is a better reminder of that fragility than a 

global pandemic taking over the world, upending our daily 
lives and threatening our health. The past few days have 
forced a kind of reflection I wasn’t prepared for. I’m sure 
many of my fellow seniors would say the same.

I don’t want to spend 45 percent of my life trying to 

be something and the other 45 percent having been 
something. But in order to spend 100 percent of our lives 
being ourselves, we have to become comfortable with the 
imperfections and incongruities life will bring. We have 
to dare to live optimistically and without fear. In this long 
journey of life, we have to find the beauty in the ordinary.

A

s I sat on a boulder in the middle 
of the Saluda River in North 
Carolina, I raised a can of Twisted 

Tea to my lips. I had never tried one before, 
and the taste was sweet and lemony — 
easily mistakable for a non-alcoholic 
beverage. “That’s dangerous,” I said to my 
friends, noting its satisfying intake that 
could have easily led me to drink five more. 

The relaxing sensation of the wind 

lightly bristled through my hair. It was the 
Fourth of July and I was conveniently on 
my day-off from working as a counselor at 
a nearby sleepaway summer camp. Calmly, 
I wandered back through the torso-deep 
waters to the riverbank to check my 
phone. I was prepared to head back to my 
camp later that afternoon, along with the 
miscellaneous crew of counselors that had 
shared an Airbnb with me the previous 
night. I was excited for that evening. I 
anticipated I would be assisting with 
the ceremonious ritual of shooting off 
fireworks for all of camp — nearly 300 
children ages six to 16 — to see. At our 
camp, the firework lighting was an honor 
reserved for only male counselors with at 
least a summer of prior camp experience. 
It was going to be a fun event which I had 
been looking forward to for weeks. 

As I checked the GroupMe app, I realized 

I had been removed from the coveted 
“Bomb Squad” chat. I quickly received a 
call from Trent, a peer who was the head of 
the boys camp. He flustered while he tried 
to explain why I had suddenly been left out. 

“What’s the issue?” I asked puzzledly. 
“They’re scared you’re going to shoot 

the fireworks at the kids,” he answered, 

referring to our managers. 

I immediately began to 

regret having been so open 
about my mental health to 
my coworkers.

My 
own 
experience 

with depression arose in 
the fall of my sophomore 
year of college, when I 
was desperately trying to 
transfer to the University 
of Michigan out of the 
elite arts university I was 
attending in New York 
City. For the better part 
of a year, I encountered 
loneliness 
unlike 
any 

kind I had experienced 
before. I essentially lived 
alone in my dorm room. 
I did everything alone: 
museums, 
basketball 

games, Broadway plays. 
In spite of my sadness, I 
was committed to making 
it work. I participated in 
intramural sports, wrote 
for a satire magazine and 
even rushed a fraternity in 
hopes of meeting someone, 
anyone, with whom I could 
form a deep connection. I 

didn’t succeed. My classes, while superb 
in instruction, were not enough to keep 
me from quickly losing maintenance of 
my social life in such a large city. It felt too 
adult, and I was too young.

At times I did not feel like I was even 

attending a university. As a theater major, 
only two-fifths of my classes were taught 
by university faculty — the others were 
led by third-party teachers from a local 
acting studio. I was essentially a glorified 
conservatory student with a lunch plan. 
Lost in the rat race of the New York City 
rush hour, I often recognized my own face 
as the youngest out of everyone on the 
subway during my commutes to and from 
classes. As my condition quickly turned 
unbearable, I turned to prescription 
medication to help alleviate the profound 
level of sadness I was experiencing.

When I was accepted to the University, 

I decided to give up a summer internship 
with a well-known improv training center 
in Chicago. I figured I needed a space that 
was familiar so I could regroup emotionally. 
I had been a counselor at the North Carolina 
summer camp before, so returning to it was 
supposed to be a refresher, something I 
hoped would be a peaceful bridge between 
one chaotic timeline to another, more 
relaxed one. I love working with kids, and 
I had hoped my summer would be just as 
enjoyable as the last. Upon my arrival, I was 
understandably questioned by my fellow 
counselors about my sudden departure 
from New York. I answered them honestly: 
I was new to medication. I was depressed. I 
needed simplicity.

B

ack on the riverbank, my call with 
Trent ended abruptly. I nearly 
dropped my iPhone into the water 

below as I became furious and fraught with 
confusion. I couldn’t think straight. My 
good friend, Henry, offered to drive my car 
back to camp as I sat in the passenger seat. 
We drove in silence before he spoke up. 

“I’m sorry, do you want to talk about it?” 

he asked. 

“What is there to talk about?” I replied. 

“I’m being punished for something I can’t 
control.” 

When I had applied to be a camp 

counselor, at no point in the application 
process was I asked about the status of my 
mental well-being. I had assumed with the 
current tide of the zeitgeist, I wouldn’t be 
barred from opportunities. It seemed like 
“Reduce The Stigma” was the catchphrase 
of 2019. It turned out my confidence in 
the public’s far-reaching acceptance of 
mental health’s destigmatization was over-
assumed. 

As I became more and more open about 

discussing these topics the first few weeks 
of camp, the summer I desired went out 
the window. Suddenly, I wasn’t leading any 
overnight camping trips. I wasn’t being 
asked to help read the daily paper aloud to 
campers in the mornings. Any scavenger 
hunt or evening activity that required a 
counselor to perform did not include me. 
This was especially unnerving when I 
would be passed up for playing characters 
or putting on costumes to judge talent 
shows. I was an acting major, after all. I had 
energy and dedication to spare that wasn’t 
being utilized. 

I knew I was being treated wrongly 

by my managers’ logic. In my mind, 
caring for a horde of 12-year-old boys in 
a woodland cabin surely must hold more 
responsibility than lighting off fireworks. 
When I returned to camp from my day 
off, I sat down with my employers face-to-
face. Both were in their twenties, like me. 
I asked them: “Should I still be allowed to 
work here?” To me, the question wasn’t 
about pettiness or simply being angry 
about not being able to light fireworks. It 
was about who they thought I was because 
of my depression, which began to shape my 
own interpretations of myself. 

Through some struggle in explaining, 

my administrator Francis countered. She 
had some pity in her eyes. “It’s not that we 
don’t trust you, we just don’t trust your 
judgment. Gut feeling? We didn’t think 
it would work.” My heart sank. Word of 
my depression had clearly gotten back to 
my managers on account of my openness. 
I felt sterilized. Meanwhile in Chicago, 
participants of my abandoned internship 
were 
meeting 
privately 
with 
Lorne 

Michaels after viewing an invite-only SNL 
audition. I left the meeting in a blur, feeling 
like I had easily accepted defeat. 

I should’ve gotten angrier, I thought, and 

more curt about the pattern of exclusion I 
had been facing for the past few weeks. 

I wished I could have conveyed how 
desperately I wanted to feel included 
rather than excluded. Any incorporation or 
trust between me and my employers would 
have done wonders for my self-confidence.

That night, the fireworks were rained 

out. 10 days later, when they were 
rescheduled, I was conveniently placed on 
another day off.

After the Fourth of July incident, 

I considered quitting my job entirely. 
However, that would’ve meant I would 
have to pack my things and head home 
for the remainder of the summer with no 
friends around and certainly no means of 
making money. For my financial and social 
health, I was stuck working under the 
heavily circumscribed agency I was being 
handed. 

From 
an 
occupational 
perspective, 

the largest roadblock in reducing mental 
health stigma seems to be the actual 
implementation 
of 
nondiscriminatory 

policies. Although it is illegal for employees 
to be fired on account of their mental health, 
an employer may request information 
about a mental health condition when there 
is objective evidence that an employee may 
pose a safety risk. This loophole is broad. 
While it may keep some workers employed, 
this rule certainly has great potential to be 
abused. 

Looking back on the disappointment 

of this past summer, I’m still fortunate 
for a lot of reasons. I’m grateful I have 
the opportunity to make such sweeping 
adjustments to my life if I’m feeling I 
require them. I’m grateful to have a 
supportive family and the option of 
pursuing higher education. I’m grateful I 
have the choice to live without medication, 
as I’ve been practicing since August. 
However, I’m aware that many others may 
find themselves in dire circumstances 
similar to mine and lack the necessary 
resources to create changes.

At the University, I volunteer on the 

Depression Center’s student advisory 
board. I joined because I wanted no 
student to feel the way I felt. Before the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we had been 
preparing to participate in mental health 
crisis training, so that we could learn to 
uplift and support friends and colleagues 
who are in danger of physical harm. 

As our culture continues to “reduce the 

stigma,” I’d like to see more initiatives 
focusing on similar crisis training which 
become 
commonplace 
for 
employers. 

Hopefully these would be taught in the 
same manner we teach CPR or anti-sexual 
harassment seminars. I’m no doctor, I’m a 
camp counselor — my best expertise is in 
playing “Capture the Flag.” But it seems 
like a good place to start.

The summer with no fireworks


I

n October 2019, I deleted my 
Instagram for a month. There was no 
dark downfall into obsession or an 

utter collapse of self-worth that prompted 
this decision, but I had been experiencing a 
plateau in my mental well-being at the time 
and had recognized social media wasn’t 
helping the problem. 

I loved Instagram from the moment I 

first downloaded it. I used to rely on it like 
a crutch, sharing content almost every day 
— posting pictures of myself smiling at a 
football game in the fall when I was lying 
in bed mid-winter, sad about a breakup or 
a falling out with a friend — and putting 
great pressure on getting likes. Now, I use 
it as a digital journal, a consistent stream of 
consciousness and look into my life: posting 
pictures of candid life moments, unfiltered 
and unplanned. 

Last fall, in a time when my peers were 

continuously posting ceremonious photos 
and announcements of accomplishments 
and future plans, I was drowning in self-
doubt and anxiety. My feed was constantly 
filled with the smiling faces of those who 
had their futures planned — drinking out of 
red cups at football tailgates, standing close 
with a significant other, happily accepting 
a return job offer and a signing bonus. 

I was genuinely overjoyed for the 

achievements of the people I followed, 
but 
I 
couldn’t 
stop 
comparing 
my 

own life to the images that filled their grid 
on my screen. Though I was aware that one 
day I’d be sharing similar achievements 
on my own profile, the time when their 
accomplishments were thrust in my face 
felt overwhelming and never-ending. I 
wanted everyone to be doing well, and I 
wanted the same for myself. 

Social media wasn’t the cause of the 

emotions I was experiencing, but my 
generalized anxiety, which I’ve struggled 
with my entire life, was greatly exacerbated 
by my glowing Instagram feed. I remember 
making the decision to post a story of a piece 
of greasy pizza that had no connection to my 
declaration of a social media detox with the 
caption “logging off for a month!” in a fat, 
pink font. The fact that I felt the need to share 
my decision to stop using Instagram with my 
followers is ironic. Maybe it’s for that reason 
I redownloaded the app three days later, 
modifying my hiatus to allow limited time for 
scrolling and no posting for a month.

After this Instagram cleanse, much like 

cutting carbs or sugar from a diet, I felt 
fresh and renewed. I didn’t need Instagram 
and even found that I now had time for 
more productive pastimes, like reading 
every night before bed. 

The deep attachment was apparent, 

though. Even after my Instagram detox, I 
essentially reverted back to my old habits, 
slipping into my posting routine like an old 

sweater. But the experiment had rendered 
me more mindful: I started to notice a 
correlation between my Instagram usage 
and the way I was feeling. Some days, 
Instagram was my therapist — others, the 
perpetrator of my anxiety. 

It isn’t a novel concept to suggest 

that social media causes mental health 
problems, or exacerbates them. But in 
struggling with these issues myself and 
growing up in a world that’s plugged in 
24/7, I hope to discover and illuminate the 
more nuanced, personalized aspect of the 
connection. 
U

nlike 
other 
generations, 

Generation Z has never known 
a time without the ease of cell 

phones, the internet and social media to stay 
connected, instantly gratified and plugged-
in. As the first generation to grow up with 
the flow of information and the immediate 
knowledge of anyone’s and everyone’s 
personal life, Gen Z has always known 
the temptation to compare their own lives 
to curated highlight reels of everyone on 
Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter 
and LinkedIn. 

Growing up with the presence of social 

media, the world becomes a vacuum as 
the details that people chose to share 
swirl together to create a hyperreality. 
Comparing someone else’s phony world of 
vacation photos, job offers, homeownership 
and new relationships to one’s real life 
is bound to leave an individual feeling 
insecure, unaccomplished and pressured to 
aspire to a level of perfection. Millennials 
have been constantly faced with an 
impossible, unspoken task: Look like you 
have it all together, exude happiness and 
appear as though everything is perfect, 
even if it isn’t. 

To maintain the masquerade is to 

convince everyone around you that you’re 
just as happy, if not happier, than they are. 
I can recall having a day-long panic attack 
— from the moment I woke up, to my desk 
at work, through the evening on the day 
following my 21st birthday — and still 
posting a filtered photo of myself smiling 
in a sparkly pink dress. 

It comes as no shock that there 

is recorded data which suggests that social 
media has an impact on the mental health 
of Gen Z. Anxiety has been linked to many 
different factors in college-aged students, 
like loneliness, stress and uncertainty as 
collateral of a transitional period, to name 
a few. Generally speaking, the rise in mental 

health issues among young adults is a trend 
which cannot be linked to one specific cause 
or tangible thing — it’s subjective. However, 
the trend of well-being in American young 
adults decreasing and the time spent on 
electronic 
devices 
increasing 
suggests 

there does exist a correlation between 
social media usage and the severity of 
mental health issues, namely anxiety and 
depression. Though correlation exists, one 
must recognize that researchers have failed 
to find casual data linking mental health 
problems and social media, thus obfuscating 
the question further.

On the other hand, one study did find 

causal evidence of an increase in well-being 
due to reduced use of social media. The study, 
done at the University of Pennsylvania in 
2018, sought to test the positive correlation 
between mental health and social media. The 
group practicing limited social media use 
saw a decrease in depression and loneliness, 
suggesting that limiting social media use can 
improve well-being. 

In my personal experience utilizing 

social media, there have been both highs 
and lows. There are days when I feel as 
though my mood is improved by viewing 
the lives of my peers, family members and 
celebrities — watching people I admire 
succeed or be entertained by interesting 
content. Conversely, there are days when I 
face a struggle with my presence on social 
media applications—comparing myself to 
images of others and monitoring my own 
social profiles can be taxing. 

But even with so many pitfalls, there 

are tremendous amounts of research 
and opinion on the basis of social media 
influencing 
mental 
health 
positively. 

A study done at the Harvard T.H. Chan 
School of Public Health found that when 
used mindfully, social media has been 
found to positively improve preexisting 
mental health issues. Research Scientist 
Mesfin Awoke Bekalu found that strong 
social networks are associated with 
positive mental health as the networks 
act as gateways for connection to others. 
He concludes that it is the way in which 
individuals use social media that is an 
important distinction when analyzing its 
effects on mental well-being. 

The question, then, is twofold: Does 

social media create or exacerbate mental 
health problems? Does it help? If it is a 
damaging force on Gen Z, how do we stop 
a train that seems to be running full steam 
ahead? 

I

n an effort to better understand 
how college-aged individuals feel in 
regard to the intersection of mental 

health and social media, I decided to reach 
out to some of my peers. Throughout my 
investigation, only a few male-identifying 
individuals were interested in being 
interviewed, which may be indicative that 
these issues affect them less intensely 
or linked to the fact that men are less likely 
to speak openly about mental health issues. 

However, there were numerous college-

aged women who expressed they’ve 
experienced both negative and positive 
effects on their mental health from social 
media usage while in college. 

“If I think about when my mental 

health issues began, it’s around the same 
time we started really using Instagram 
and Snapchat,” said Sophia Maita, a 
senior at Fordham University studying 
communications and culture. 

Maita, who experienced the onset of 

mental health issues around age 12, claims 
social media has had both a negative and a 
positive influence on her emotional well-
being. “I’ve tried to set up my social media 
to be positive … I follow a lot of inspirational 
accounts,” she said. 

The posts that often make people jealous 

or insecure can sometimes play in as a 
positive: “It makes me happy to see people 
on Instagram and Facebook doing well and 
being successful,” she said.

But it’s a careful balancing act.
“Just seeing people out partying with 

someone who I’m not friends with or don’t 
get along with can be difficult.” 

The fear of missing out, often referred 

to as FOMO, can be defined as anxiety 
caused when you find out about an event 
that you are not attending or weren’t 
invited to. Usually, people are exposed to 
such information via social media posts. It 
is the feeling that everyone is having more 
fun than you, or experiencing something 
novel or exciting, and that you’re missing 
it. It can have negative effects on both 
happiness and self-esteem and has been 
found to provoke great distress.

That being said, FOMO can turn into 

something more sinister than a feeling of 
unease at a Snapchat story of your friends 
at a bar without you. 

“When I see on spring break or in the 

summer people looking so hot in bikini 
photos, and that was what I was struggling 
with my freshman and sophomore year of 
college ... feeling envy or shame really took 

a toll on my eating habits and how I felt 
about my body.” Maita said. 

Social media — especially Instagram 

— has been found to be damaging in 
regards to eating disorders: While it does 
not necessarily cause them, it normalizes 
disordered eating behaviors and fosters 
body 
dysmorphia. 
Most 
recently, 

TikTok has been filled with pro-eating 
disorder content. Many teenage girls 
have normalized posting videos of their 
“FDOE”, or full day of eating, in which they 
list the calories of their every meal — most 
often between 600-800 a day. The app has 
been known to glorify skipping meals and 
to promote weight loss supplements, thigh 
gaps and the constant weighing of oneself. 
TikTok has even been dubbed “Pro-Ana,” 
a term to describe the promotion of eating 
disorders like anorexia. 

Instagram has also been criticized 

for emphasizing a pro-eating disorder 
narrative, 
like 
through 
accounts 

that 
promote 
diet 
culture. 
These 

accounts 
advertise 
over-exercise, 

compulsive dieting and calorie counting, 
which can be extremely destructive 
to someone already engaging in eating 
disorder habits or tendencies. There are 
also “fitspiration” and “health” Instagram 
accounts that promote healthy habits like 
exercise, nourishing oneself and evading 
diet culture. 

“With any platform that has pages and 

accounts that aren’t tied to a singular 
person — like fitness or foodie accounts — 
we have the option to view diet and fitness 
accounts all day if we want, which can be 
dangerous to people with pre-existing 
mental health problems,” said LSA senior 
Hallie Fox.

 “I definitely think it’s a double-sided 

coin. You can see weight loss accounts 
saying ‘this is what people should look 
like’ but there are also accounts that 
are for recovery and struggles and body 
positivity,” Fox said.

Instagram has a huge community of 

eating disorder recovery accounts, run by 
women predominantly, who share their 
struggles with recovering from an eating 
disorder and use the platform as a food 
journal to hold themselves accountable. 
While this creates a sense of community and 
solidarity for eating disorder sufferers and 
survivors, doctors urge that such accounts 
cannot replace professional treatment.

Many social media are dedicated to 

creating a sense of unity 
and 

a space for those who feel alone in their 
struggle. Millennials and members of Gen 
Z have been both criticized and lauded for 
general openness about struggles with 
mental health and the de-stigmatization 
of therapy and dialogue around emotional 
well-being. 

SMTD sophomore Harper Klotz found their 

community online, on the website Tumblr. 

“After being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 

and PTSD I didn’t know anyone around me 
experiencing these things, so I looked for 
resources and people online that I could relate 
to. Tumblr made me realize I wasn’t alone in 
what I was experiencing,” they said.

Online platforms are seldom regulated, 

which is part of why they work so well in 
connecting people and allowing them to be 
vulnerable. But there is a dark side to this 
openness. 

“Tumblr and Twitter can be really toxic, 

especially Tumblr … there was a lot of 
glorification of suicide and eating disorders 
… there’s mixed messages because anyone 
can post anything,” Klotz added. 
W

ith millennials and members 
of Gen Z connected to our 
mobile devices at all times, 

perhaps it’s in our best interest to seek 
out profiles and accounts that make us 
feel good, as opposed to relentlessly 
comparing our lives to others, which can 
lead to destructive consequences. It’s 
almost impossible to know — in a place 
as vast and open ended as the internet, 
where anyone can post anything — what 
provokes distress and what introduces 
positive emotions. Many people don’t want 
to waste time on social media, but feel 
trapped. If we decide to stop utilizing 
social media altogether, we forgo a major 
means of interaction, communication and 
socialization between peers, friends and 
family members. Without social media, 
one could lose the ability to network, 
keep in touch with connections and even 
get hired for jobs. There’s almost no way 
to unplug — and even unplugging could 
bring on other negative feelings, like 
FOMO. 

Social media can be a haven of support 

and love, spreading affection in the form 
of a thumbs up and digital hearts, but it 
can also be a destructive path of pressure 
and comparison. The future is unclear 
for teenagers and young adults, with 
TikTok popular among young people and 
even LinkedIn causing exacerbations in 
stress and anxiety. Perhaps the balance 

— and solution — is for us to figure out on 
an individual basis. On the other hand, 
perhaps it is a societal-level issue worth 
concern and attention. 
D

uring my Instagram hiatus, I 
noticed I took fewer photographs 
than I normally would have. It 

seemed to suggest that I only feel inclined 
to take pictures with the prospect of posting 
them, not necessarily just to have them to 
look back on as a memory. On vacation over 
fall break, I didn’t post once — not a picture 
of an aesthetically pleasing palm tree, a 
Caribbean sunset, a fruity cocktail or my 
silhouette fake-looking out at the ocean in 
a purple bikini — which is surprising given 
my inclination to shareable social media 
platforms like Instagram. 

I couldn’t decide if I was worse or better off 

without fulfilling the itch to feel fleetingly 
satisfied promoting happy, jubilant photos. 
I didn’t give in to a phony desire to share 
my life with the world, and eventually even 
forgot about posting altogether. I was no 
longer caught up in what everyone else was 
doing and how they looked over fall break. I 
had come down from the drug, and I was at 
a strange homeostasis. 

Social media is inevitable. It exists and 

we live among it. We can choose to embrace 
it for its wonderful qualities or hate it for 
its negative ones — or we can recognize 
that it can be imperfect and wonderful 
simultaneously. 

I’ve often thought about taking time 

off from social media again. Now, though, 
I feel more inclined to use platforms 
like Instagram and Twitter — which 
have benefited me by way of news, 
comedy, connection and entertainment 
— productively, rather than as a filter of 
my life. I have accepted the ebb and flow 
of social media platforms on my mental 
health, and recognized the negative 
exacerbation Instagram can have when I 
am coping with anxiety and stress. I am 
the only one who can bar social media from 
making me feel worse. 

For those of us who have lived in the 

yo-yo effect of deleting, redownloading 
and feeling incredibly aware of and 
attached to our profiles, I urge you to find 
ways to limit your use. Observe your own 
social media practices and focus on how 
they make you feel. Unplug for a few days. 
Practice Instagram and Snapchat use in 
moderation. Only in fostering a healthy 
balance for oneself can emotional well-
being truly improve.

Instagram was my therapy … until it wasn’t


Wednesday, March 18, 2020 // The Statement
6B

I 

was in fifth-grade music class when 
I discovered my first pimple. It 
didn’t hurt, there was just a small 

raised bump on my cheek. I turned to 
one of my friends and asked if there was 
something on my face.

She examined it. “Looks like a zit,” she 

said. “Want me to pop it?”

I recoiled. “Can’t I just wipe it off?” I 

rubbed my palm on my cheek.

She laughed. “It’s stuck to your face. 

You can’t wipe it off.” The bell rang and 
I walked out of the room, horrified, 
imagining a foreign object growing 
through my skin.

When I got home, I examined it in the 

mirror. It was a slightly-red bump, hardly 
noticeable. I didn’t know what she meant 
by “popping” it, though I remembered 
hearing someone being told to pop a zit 
in an episode of “The Suite Life of Zack 
and Cody.” I squeezed it until it became 
angry, red and definitely noticeable. But 
not a pop.

In truth, I didn’t really know what acne 

was supposed to look like — I’d rarely seen 
it in the media, only when mentioned as 
a joke or partially airbrushed away from 
actors’ faces on Disney Channel. My 
parents didn’t have it, and neither did my 
cousins or my brother. I went home and 
told my mom, who bought me a face wash 
with salicylic acid in it. The pimple went 
away within a few days.

As the acne began invading my face 

more often, the face wash stopped 
working. I resorted to YouTube to give 
me resources for how to treat it myself. 
Toothpaste, olive oil, aluminum foil, 
baking soda, honey and lemon seemed 
to do the trick for other people, but only 
aggravated my acne-prone and dry skin. I 
wished I could just pop my pimples and be 
done with them, but they felt deeper, like 
they had sprouted from within my pores 
and I had to dig them out by the roots.

Acne had created an anxious cycle 

for me: My acne caused anxiety, which 
caused me to pick and squeeze at it to get 
rid of it, which only made my skin worse. 
The stress caused me to break out more, 
too. 

A couple years later, I started seeing a 

dermatologist and found out that I had 
cystic acne, which happens when hair 
follicles plug with oil and dead skin cells. 
The doctor told me I was producing more 
of this oil due to a hormone imbalance. 
Since there was no whitehead to pop, they 
would poke my face with a needle and let 
the acne drain every couple of months, 
leaving me bleeding and red when I left. 

I sat quietly in the car as my mom drove 
me home, dreading the next day when 
I had to go to school with scabs forming 
over my red bumps. I felt the pain in every 
pore.

I 
tried 
buying 
over-the-counter 

products, using a customizable skin 
regimen and then switching to creams 
prescribed by my dermatologist. After 
none of these worked, I finally began 
taking an antibiotic that made me more 

sensitive to sun rays. While the acne 
cleared up slightly, taking it during 
the summer left me with months-long 
sunburns. I couldn’t run cross country 
without frying my shoulders, and my 
Spanish teacher frequently asked if I’d 
just gone on a vacation because of my 
frequently-burned nose.

I didn’t know if people were looking at 

me because of my acne or my sunburns 
— it felt like this new kind of redness 
brought more attention than a bad acne 
flare. I stopped taking the antibiotic and 
switched to a combined birth control pill, 
which would help balance my hormones 
and hopefully get rid of my acne once and 
for all. And though the new pill helped 
with the acne, it made the anxiety and 

depression worse, a struggle between the 
internal and external.

Through the years, my mental health 

suffered greatly as I watched my face fill 
with unwanted red dots. Every time I left 
the house, I felt like everyone was staring 
at it, and eventually, I grew my hair out so 
it covered my cheeks. I didn’t make eye 
contact when I talked to people. When I 
would pose for photos next to my friends 
I made sure they had the flash off, and I 

angled my body so the spots would be 
concealed.

The thing about acne is that it has the 

potential to permeate the rest of your 
life. It’s a badge of anxiety worn on your 
face, and you never know what would 
have been different if you didn’t have it. 
Would I have performed better in that job 
interview? Would I have had more friends 
growing up? Is it harder to socialize with 
people because I’m afraid people don’t 
actually like me?

Acne is the most common skin condition 

in the United States, affecting up to 85 
percent of people between the ages of 12 
and 24 — so why is there so much shame 
attached to it? Maybe it’s because there 
are certain beauty standards that we 

see in the media, and celebrities must be 
“ready for their close up” with flawless 
skin. Maybe it’s because people think it’s 
gross and have internalized the idea that 
people with acne have bad hygiene: I’ve 
been told many times to wash my face 
more, though, in my experience, those 
with acne are often the ones taking the 
best care of their skin. They know how 
much work it takes to avoid a flare-up.

Having acne has taken an immense 

toll on my mental health, and I’m 
not the only one; the emerging field 
of 
psychodermatology 
reveals 
the 

connection between skin health and 
mental 
health. 
Psychophysiological 

disorders such as eczema, psoriasis, acne 
and hives are common “skin disorders 
that are worsened or, in some cases, 
brought on by emotional stress,” and 
“certain emotional states can lead to 
increased inflammation in the body.” This 
ultimately can lead to a cycle of mental 
health negatively impacting the skin.

After going off of birth control for 

mental health reasons, my acne came 
back — and it began to scar. Though the 
bumps themselves came and went, I was 
left with permanent imprints on my face, 
a visible reminder of my invisible mental 
struggles.

I began wearing makeup nearly every 

day to cover up my scars, which only 
plugged my pores more. It was a temporary 
fix, a band-aid for the days when I couldn’t 
handle the anxiety of going outside with a 
face full of acne. But it became a crutch, 
something I had to rely on, because 
underneath the foundation my pimples 
started getting worse. It added another 
aspect to the cycle: Makeup gave me more 
acne, which gave me more anxiety, which 
caused more acne and more makeup. I 
only stopped when I reached the bottom 
of my mental health barrel last winter, 
and instead of honing my makeup skills, 
I switched to working on my self-esteem.

I have gone through plenty of chemical 

peels 
and 
new 
dermatologists 
and 

prescription pills and expensive topicals 
to know that the best way to heal acne 
is to work on your mind first. Adding 
stress and makeup to the cycle just hurts 
your confidence, when healing comes 
from treating your skin gently, as well as 
yourself. Over the last 10 years of dealing 
with acne, I know my mind and body 
have a stronger connection than they 
did before. I am gentler with myself, in 
my skincare routine and in my self-talk, 
and know that being OK with myself will 
always translate into my skin.

hen I was a child, my family used 
to go on nighttime walks during 
the summer. I remember strolling 

along the tree-lined sidewalks of New York City, 
purposefully going down the least well-lit path-
ways so I could spot fireflies. 

I would gently reach my small hands toward 

any pulsating green light and softly clasp my 
fingers together to catch them. My brother and 
I would giggle as light escaped from our finger-
tips, the fireflies’ legs tickling our palms. Light 
pollution may have blocked the visibility of the 
starry night sky, but we didn’t notice — the fire-
flies were the stars brought down to earth for us 
to enjoy. These were stars we could reach. 

As I grew older and my family continued 

going on walks in the cool summer nights, I saw 
less and less fireflies. At first, I thought it was 
because I was growing up and not paying atten-
tion to them as much. I soon learned that the 
light pollution that was blocking me from see-
ing the night sky was also starting to shield the 
stars I had played with as a child — the fireflies 
— on Earth. 

It’s important to establish early education 

about climate change. Even being from a city 
whose nickname is the “concrete jungle,” I 
learned about conservation and climate change 
from a young age. As a child, I loved going to 
the Bronx Zoo, where they curate each exhibit 
so that you must pay attention to conservation 
efforts and the effects of human-induced cli-
mate change on wildlife populations. Before 
being able to see the gorillas at the zoo, every-
one was led into a small theater with dark, plush 
seats and curtains for walls to watch a short film 
about what field researchers and conservation-
ists do to help the gorilla population. The image 
of field researchers carefully treading the moist 
rainforest soil in search of gorillas is ingrained in 
my mind, but the conservation lessons that come 
from it are much more impactful.

In a summer gardening program at the 

New York Botanical Gardens, my friends and I 
learned about the impact of pesticides and safe 
pest control measures, how to properly take care 
of and sustainably harvest a plot of land and how 
to use the harvest to make food and to feed other 
animals. 

I was living in a bubble, young and surround-

ed by environmentally-conscious family and 
friends who introduced me to progressive modes 
of thought. The world I lived in when I was 
younger was trying to work its hardest to live in 
harmony with the planet and save its creatures 
— rehabilitating endangered populations, using 
environmentally-friendly cleaning products and 
using reusable bags well before a plastic bag ban 
was in effect. 

I grew up thinking environmental regulations 

were of importance to the government, never 
dreaming that future leaders would threaten 
them. I thought it was a fact of life that our world 
will only get better from here. I strongly believed 
that we were on a path to living lives that would 
benefit — not harm — the planet.

As I grew older and met more people, my 

world expanded. I had to learn that there were 
people who did not grow up familiar with con-
servation efforts, who did not know of ways to 
live with, as opposed to against, the planet and 
other animals. I learned that there are people 
who are not empathetic to animals, plants and 
the inanimate parts of the earth. To this day, it is 
difficult for me to understand these mentalities, 
especially as our climate quickly and dramati-
cally deteriorates.

The list of climate change effects is a long one: 

the Great Barrier Reef dying, the longer periods 
of drought and heat, habitat loss on a massive 
scale due to products such as palm oil or fires, 
the increased frequencies of natural disasters.

I developed climate anxiety as a result of the 

rapid tangible changes in ecosystems due to 
climate change. Human-driven climate change 
is not only potentially physically harmful, but 
psychologically harmful as well. Research 
shows that climate change has and will continue 
to exacerbate mental health issues such as anxi-
ety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depres-
sion.

I witnessed the growing climate anxiety 

not only in myself, but in others, first hand 
with the bushfires in Australia, which not only 
impacted the country of Australia but the entire 
world. Social media was flooded with pictures of 
severely burned animals, videos of koalas com-
ing up to tourists for water and stories of people 
losing their homes. The air quality dropped 
drastically and situations became dangerous in 
major cities, like Sydney. You could see the haze 
of the smoke from South America.

The Australian bushfires were uncontrol-

lable, leaving a lot of people feeling helpless. As 
I currently write this from Australia during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, I can tell you that Austra-
lians don’t panic unless there is reason to panic. 
While family and friends in the United States 
bombard me with messages about COVID-19, 
life goes on in Australia. So you can imagine how 
impactful an event would have to be to startle 
the people of Australia, and that is exactly what 
the bushfires have done here.

Every single professor I have had here in Mel-

bourne has mentioned the bushfires during their 
class — both their psychological and ecologi-
cal impact. Even though the smoke’s haze has 
cleared, it has revealed mass habitat destruction. 

My climate anxiety manifests itself in a rush 

of emotions — anger, disappointment, sadness, 
nervousness — and can creep up at any time. 
Hearing about the recent Australian bushfires 
forced me to stop looking at my phone. I couldn’t 
look at social media without my chest tighten-
ing and my heart racing. My eyes welled up with 
tears at the sight of displaced animals. 

Even smaller events trigger my climate anxi-

ety: Whenever I witness people sorting their 
trash incorrectly, when I see people using single-
use plastic, when I hear people say that their one 
lifestyle change will not make a difference or 
when I watch our nation’s leaders deny that cli-
mate change is an issue driven by human impact. 
My climate anxiety is triggered when I hear that 
the University is willing to arrest students — cli-
mate warriors — who are fighting for our future 
by telling those in power to take accountability 
in their major monetary contribution to climate 
change.

As I grew older, I drastically changed my 

lifestyle. My lifestyle acts as a therapy for me. I 
became vegetarian and greatly reduced my ani-
mal product consumption after observing farm-
ing practices during a veterinary sciences trip 
to Costa Rica. I reduce my time in the shower 
and try to only thrift and buy sustainably-made 
clothing. 

My climate anxiety is caused by a feeling of a 

lack of control. We have few leaders to look up 
to, and environmental policy never seems to be 
at the forefront of our political sphere or in the 
media. The anxiety is further perpetuated by the 
feeling that our generation will be left to clean up 
the mess past generations have made. 

I have had conversations with friends who 

are seriously considering a future that includes 
not having children because they do not want 
to bring someone into a world that will soon be 
unbearable to live in. 

There is no “cure” to any mental health ill-

ness, but climate anxiety can be alleviated with 
a group effort. First and foremost, vote for those 
in government whose main priority is to help the 
environment. Educate yourself on conservation 
efforts and the facts about climate change. Know 
that every action has a large impact, a ripple 
effect. We need to take control with our votes, 
our actions and our minds — and do it with com-
passion. It’s not a cure, but it’s a start to a solu-
tion.
