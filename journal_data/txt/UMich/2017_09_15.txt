ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

It has now been mere months over 

200 years since the University of 
Michigan’s inception.

Two hundred years worth of 

innovation, academic renown and 
multidisciplinary 
excellence, 
as 
a 

nationwide example and world leader, 
and of student activists, up-and-
coming politicians, surgeons, CEOs, 
intellectuals 
and 
altruists. 
Two 

hundred years of those who have 
studied history and those who have 
helped make it.

So 
as 
administrators, 
faculty, 

staff, alumni and students celebrate 
the University’s Bicentennial, they 
also reflect on what will come in 
the next 200, particularly in terms 
of 
the 
University’s 
educational 

advances, 
outside-of-the-classroom 

opportunities and the community that 
makes up the University.

As an academic innovator:
University President Mark Schlissel 

has 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 

academic 
innovation 
throughout 

his 
tenure. 
Schlissel’s 
Academic 

Innovation Initiative from fall 2016 has 
expanded from simpler massive online 
open courses in the Office of Digital 
Education to ultimately include more 
educational resources and a teach-out 
series on significant contemporary 
topics, just a few ways in which 
academics at the University are moving 
forward.

“The initiative will formally help us 

consider how U of M will lead the way 
through the information age,” Schlissel 

said last September.

James Hilton, vice provost for 

academic innovation, said there are 
several schools of thought regarding 
where the University will go with 
its 
educational 
programs 
next, 

particularly with an ever-changing 
technological landscape allowing for a 
number of possibilities.

“One of the things we’ve been talking 

a lot about in academic innovation is 
using this third century as a moment 
to stop and think about — particularly 
at the great public research university 
— where do we see education going 
forward?” Hilton said. “There is an 
opportunity to imagine again what an 
education at a great public research 
university should be for this century, 
this economy, this technology, this set 
of societal issues.”

Tools 
like 
eCoach, 
Gradecraft 

and hybrid-learning environments, 
Hilton stressed, are being improved 
to personalize learning; there are now 
also 112 massive open online courses 
that are in production and 6 million 
global learners engaged with those 
courses, numbers that grow on a daily 
basis.

“To the extent that we’re successful 

in diversifying the pool of students that 
come here, we also want to diversify 
the paths that they get to pursue when 
they get here,” Hilton said.

Hilton’s 
ideal 
version 
of 
the 

University is one where students are 
on campus more often throughout 
their lives, for shorter periods of time.

“I actually foresee a future of 

Michigan that is a future where we 
think about education really as a global 
and lifelong relationship,” Hilton said. 

“You’re never going to stop being 
in a relationship with educational 
institutions, you’re constantly going to 
be retraining, reimagining.”

Improving 
the 
richness 
and 

diversity of experiences students have 
and demonstrate later on in life has to 
be improved, Hilton said.

“We have to look at different ways 

of delivering learning experiences,” 
Hilton said. “We have to look at 
new ways of certifying those kind of 
experiences. We have to embrace in 
a critical and informed way the role 
that data and evidence can play in 
shaping how we design learning 
experiences.”

Campus 
Planner 
Sue 

Gott too believes there 
is a necessity to adjust 
learning and teaching 
environments as learning 
styles, technology and 
social norms change in 
order to remain globally 
competitive.

“Helping 
to 

expose life styles to 
students 
who 

may 
not 

have 
had 

certain opportunities or experiences 
so that we can help them go out in the 
world and be great leaders tomorrow, 
I think, makes this a revolving door 
for excellence in strengthening the 
incredibly 
brilliant 
students 
that 

arrive here to add greater dimensions 
to who they are and what they want 
to accomplish when they leave,” Gott 
said.

Gott foresees the campus remaining 

central to the future 

of the University, 
 

albeit a campus 

which is ever-

evolving. 

“I 
think 

campuses are certainly going to 
continue to need to exist and we 
may ebb and flow a bit to continue to 
respond to world changes,” Gott said. 
“But I see it as being critical to the 
transformation of young people into 
responsible citizens by enriching and 
diversifying their experiences and 
creating those growth opportunities.” 

Diversifying academic experiences 

is something LSA senior Anushka 
Sarkar, Central Student Government 
president, 
said 
should 
be 

more 
of a priority 

moving 

forward.

October 1, 1927 - Michigan’s 

new stadium, with its seating 
capacity of almost 75,000 seats, 
will be ready at game time today 
to receive what is expected to be 
the largest crowd ever to attend 
a Michigan home game, it was 
announced yesterday. Only a 
small block of seats, not to exceed 
100, demand more attention, and 
these will not be available. The 
stadium, regarded by contractors 
as one of the finest of its kind in the 
country, is 2,500 feet around, with 
22 miles of California redwood 
seats used to fill it. 11,000 yards 
of concrete, and 71,000 sacks 
cement have been necessary to 
the working of the structure. The 
stands contain 68 rows in each 
section, as well as four rows of 
boxes, these extending around the 
entire field. Only a few of these 
seats will not be available when 
Michigan meets Ohio Wesleyan 
today. In addition to the grandeur 
of the new stadium, the press box 
is regarded as the most modern 
and complete of its kind. A 
seating capacity of more than 250 
people is one of the outstanding 
features of this structure which is 
equipped with all possible types 
of wire and radio conveniences. 
The finishing touches have not yet 
been added, but it will be ready for 
work today. Included among the 
spectators who will be present to 

inaugurate the new structure will 
be more than 36,000 high school 
students who have been invited 
to attend the game as guests of 
the Michigan athletic association. 
These students will meet at 2:30 
o’clock at Yost field house, where 

they will hear a brief talk by 
President Clarence Cook Little 
on the outstanding merits of the 
University. From the Field house 
they will be escorted to the field 
by the Varsity band to witness the 
game.

Ground Broken During Commencement Week 
by President Hutchins; Cooley Residence to Go

Kick Isn’t There, But the Price Has Gone Up Just the Same

Brass Ensemble Of Band Opens Dedicatory Rites With Fanfare, 
Ruthven Receives Bells From Baird, Carillonneur From Ottawa Peace 

July 22, 1916 - Ground for the 

new Michigan Union clubhouse 
having been broken during 
Commencement by President 
Harry B. Hutchins, it is now 
estimated that the building 
will be completed some time 
next 
spring. 
Michigan 
will 

then possess one of the finest 
clubhouses 
in 
the 
country. 

For many years the Union 
has occupied the old Cooley 
residence on State street. Owing 
to the very rapid growth of the 
University, the need for more 
room and improved facilities 
for the Union has been felt for 
some time. The campaign for 
the fund for the new building 
was begun in the fall of 1915. 
The campaign extended all over 
the country. In all the large 
cities, committees of Michigan 
Alumni were organized. Mass 
meetings were held in many 
of the large cities, and it is 
largely due to the efforts and 
enthusiasm of the alumni that 

the new clubhouse has become 
a possibility. The activities 
in Ann Arbor consisted in 
campaigns 
to 
enlarge 
the 

present membership of the 
Union. 
Undergraduates 
also 

sent out postcards to alumni 
in their home towns, in order 
to increase the interest in 
the campaign, and to explain 
its purposes and the spirit 
under which it was started. 
The mark set for the fund 
was a million, and at present 
the amount is $750,000 and 
is 
steadily 
increasing. 
The 

architects for the new building 
are Pond & Pond of Chicago, 
two 
Michigan 
alumni. 
The 

Union will be a four-story 
building and will contain such 
things as a swimming-pool, 
committee rooms, rooms for 
alumni, various dining rooms, 
reading rooms and other social 
features. The new Michigan 
Union is to be a memorial to Dr. 
James Burrill Angell.

May 9, 1920 - Students of 

the University of Michigan 
are drinking heavily. In the 
face of prohibition laws, both 
state and federal, the taste 
for drink is too much and the 
thirsty student is succumbing 
to temptation. It is true that 
students 
of 
the 
University 

are drinking heavily. Figures, 
that never lie, tell a tale of 
consumption that rivals that 

of pre-prohibition days when 
you could get a drink for the 
asking. The high cost of living 
has brought with it the high 
cost of drinking, yet the student 
defies even this hazard and 
will satisfy his thirst. Gone 
‘Way Up! Even though coca 
colas have advanced from five 
cents a glass, and even though 
malted milks are bringing the 
drug stores twenty and twenty-
five cents each, the students 
continue to drink heavily. 

Drinking, they have found, 

can be done very efficiently, 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
the 

sizzling 
hot 
and 
powerful 

sensation of gin or whiskey 
is no longer there to make a 
pathway down one’s throat 
for the final wallop. Even the 
wallop is missing in these 
new drinks, yet the students 
continue to drink of them 
heavily. Spirits are lacking on 
the campus. Both the Oliver 
Lodge kind and the kind with 

the wallop. If you have the kind 
with a wallop, every man is 
your friend. But if you haven’t, 
said would be friend must 
satisfy himself with the milder 
drinks that are served him at 
the local soda emporiums. But 
the lack of the kick, deters him 
not. He continues to drink, 
kick or no kick, and he drinks 
heavily. Figures gathered at 
the various drug stores and the 
Union soda fountain bear out 
that statement.

December 
5, 
1936 
- 
As 

the musical tones of the Baird 
Carillon’s 53 bells faded into a grey 
December dusk, the University’s 
newest monument, its long silence 
broken, 
had 
yesterday 
been 

formally dedicated to coming 
generations of Michigan students. 
Participating in an impressive 
ceremony, modelled closely after 
an ancient English custom of 
dedication of church bells, were 
President Ruthven, Charles Baird, 
‘95, donor of the carillon, and 
Frank Godfrey, engineer for the 
English firm which cast the bells. A 
fanfare played by a brass ensemble 
of the Michigan Band stationed in 
the bell chamber 10 stories above 
the campus opened the dedication 
at 4:15 p.m. After the University 
Glee Club had sung “Laudesatque 

Carmina,” the formal presentation 
was made in Hill Auditorium. 

Symbol Is Presented 
Mr. Baird, Kansas City lawyer, 

said in presenting to President 
Ruthven a small silver bell symbolic 
of the third largest carillon in the 
world:

“From the time I entered this 

University 46 years ago I have 
loved it. It has been an inspiration 
to me all my life. I feel that I cannot 
repay the University of Michigan 
for what she has given me. “All 
the friends of Dr. Burton who 
knew and loved him will rejoice 
in this realization of a dream of 
his, frustrated by an untimely 
death.” President Ruthven, in 
accepting the bells in behalf of 
the University, said: “The Charles 
Baird Carillon is to be considered 
an important educational facility 
of the University of Michigan for 

it will further the comprehensive 
objective of our schools— the 
production of cultured men and 
women. Mr. Baird, you have made 
for yourself an enduring place in 
the University of Michigan family. 
I accept these bells for the Board 
of Regents. Everytime these lovely 
tones sound over campus, city 
and countryside some soul will be 
cheered, encouraged and uplifted.” 

Blakeman Offers Prayer 
A dedicatory prayer was offered 

by Dr. E. W. Blakeman, counselor 
of religion, followed by seven 
sonorous bongs from the Bourdon 
Bell; and then the Glee Club and 
the audience joined in singing 
the “Yellow and Blue.” Wilmot 
Pratt, 
carillonneur, 
starting 

with 
“America,” 
played 
six 

selections, including Beethoven’s 
“Variations,” on ‘Ode to Joy’,” and 
Mozart’s “Minuet.” Percival Price, 

Dominion carillonneur for the 
Peace Tower in Ottawa, was among 
several 
visiting 
carillonneurs 

and musical directors. He will 
remain in Ann Arbor today to 
play several selections at noon, 
according to Prof. Earl V. Moore, 
director of the School of Music. 
Approximately 
4,000 
people 

attended the ceremonies and 
recital. As Wilmot Pratt’s final 
notes of Denyn’s “Preludium 
for Carillon” trailed into a bleak 
gunmetal sky, a carillon was 
dedicated which will sing out on 
many another December day and 
many a balmy spring day also, as 
President Ruthven says, “To cheer, 
encourage and uplift.” Mr. Baird 
was guest last night at a dinner 
given by Professor Moore at which 
various members of the University 
were present, including Mr. Pratt 
and Mr. Price.

“I’m really optimistic about the 
progress that we’ve made in the 
last 20 years or so. We’ve worked 
a lot on college affordability, we’ve 
worked a lot on making this campus 
more representative of the people 
that make up the state of Michigan 
and make up the country, and I think 
we’ve seen the University of Michi-
gan come out time and time again 
as the leader in fields across the 
world— we’re a beacon for people 
no matter where they’re from. One 
of the most important parts of our 
history is our activism...I know that 
in the next ten years or so we’ll have 
even more progress because of stu-
dents continuing to commit to that 
era of activism.”

FE ATURE D PEOPLE

The Michigan Daily asked University faculty members, staff members or students 

what the University Bicentennial means to them. 
Stadium will receive first crowd 
of football fans this afternoon

“The Bicentennial, to me, has 
provided many of us in the 
college an opportunity to do two 
different things. One is to look 
back on our successes and also 
learn from the times in which 
we weren’t as successful as we 
could’ve been, and to think about 
what are the lessons learned 
from the last 200 years. The 
other thing that the Bicentennial 
has allowed us to do — which is 
difficult to do, given the pace of 
what’s happening and all of our 
day-to-day work — is to think 
about what do the next 100 years 
look like for the college?”

LSA Dean

TODAY


Jan 4, 1955 - The Board of 

Regents for the first time in 
University history has sanctioned a 
student government.

Taking cognizance of strong 

campus support for the Student

Government Council proposal, 

the Regents approved the new form 
of University student government at 
their Dec. 17 meeting.

SGC, composed of 11 elected 

and seven ex-officio members, 
replaces 
Student 
Legislature 

and 
the 
15-member 
Student 

Affairs Committee, the student 
government of the last six years. 
SL, although recognized by SAC, 
has never been recognized by the 
Regents.

Earlier in December, an all-

campus student poll conducted at 
request of the Regents gave SGC 
a favorable 5,102 to 1,451 vote. 
Election To Be Discussed 

Vice-President 
for 
Student 

Affairs James A. Lewis will meet 
today with the seven ex-officio 
members of SGC and the Dean 
of Men and the Dean of Women 
to initiate procedure for bringing 
the new student government into 
existence.

The group will consider the 

election of SGC representatives 
and other matters pertaining to 
transition to the new government. 
Vice - President Lewis said he 
expects 
the 
election 
of 
SGC 

members will take place between 
March 15 and 30 but added the 
“sooner the better.”

He would like the election 

as early as possible so that the 
experience of this year’s student 
leaders. may be utilized as much as 
possible in getting SGC organized 
and underway.

Election Dates Suggested
A motion to hold the elections 

March 29 and 30 will be introduced 
to the still functioning SL at its 
meeting tomorrow night. David 
Levy, ‘57, SL elections chairman 
for the elections held Dec. 8 and 
9, thinks it will take at least eight 
weeks to organize a smooth 
running election.

Elections for SGC couldn’t be 

held until after the start of the spring 
semester-because of interference 
with final examinations. Although 
Vice-President Lewis said yesterday 
his group will make final decisions, 
comment indicated yesterday there 
would 
be 
general 
cooperation 

among campus groups in holding 

the election. One SL member 
suggested a plan by which all 
groups represented by an ex-officio 
member on SGC would assist with 
the election.

Groups Represented on SGC
Groups 
represented 
by 

ex-officio members are the Union, 
League, Pan-Hellenic, Assembly, 
Interfraternity 
Council, 
Inter-

House Council and The Daily.

SGC, approved for a two-year 

trial period, has various functions 
including 
recognition 
of 
new 

campus organizations, approval or 
disapproval of student-sponsored 
activities, coordinating student 
activities and originating student 
projects among others.

Subject To Review
SGC action will be subject to 

review by a seven member Board 
of Review consisting of the Dean 
of Men, Dean of Women, three 
faculty members and two student 
members. Student members will be 
the President of SGC and one other 
member appointed by the Council. 

The Board must declare its 

intention to review a decision 
of SGC within 96 hours of its 
appearance in the Daily Official 
Bulletin or the decision becomes 
final.

Students’ Explosion Termed ‘Spring 
Madness’ by Dean

Children To Get Bettered Version, Discoverer Says 
New Vaccine Now Potentially 100 Per Cent Effective

Trainees To Live in West, Quad Group Will Include Students in NROTC, 
Engineers, Pre-Meds, Men in Basic Training

March 22, 1952 - University 

officials are not planning to take 
disciplinary action against those 
who participated in the seven 
hours of hectic student “rioting” 
Thursday night.

As 
reports 
of 
the 
mob’s 

impulsive 
exploits 
continued 

to trickle in yesterday, Dean 
of Students Erich A. Walter 
released a statement clarifying 
the University’s position on the 
unexpected spring blow-up:

“The student demonstration 

was a form of spring madness,” 
Dean 
Walter 
said. 
“The 

term 
‘madness’ 
has 
the 

implication of being something 
uncontrollable.”

“We were fortunate in not 

having serious accidents, in not 
having a mob spirit develop. I 
am glad that there had to be no 
arrests and that the property 
damage was of an insignificant 
character. “I am sorry that a 
few of our students showed 
some 
pretty 
bad 
manners,” 

he continued. “Most of them, 
considering 
that 
they 
were 

out of order, showed marks of 
self-control which, in general, 
are the characteristics of our 
student body.

“If any students are reported 

to us who have violated specific 
University 
regulations, 
these 

students 
will 
be 
heard 
by 

the 
regularly 
constituted 

disciplinary authorities.”

In 
reviewing 
the 

demonstration, 
we 
obviously 

shall try to establish some 
controls of a moral character 
that may operate in a crisis. 
Obviously, this is difficult to 
accomplish. No human being 
has ever attempted to shift the 
vernal equinox,” he added.

Despite 
the 
avalanche 
of 

mob hysteria, damage and theft 
were reported at a minimum. 
Martha Cook suffered the most 
costly vandalism. An estimated 

$200 in damages was inflicted 
at the women’s residence. The 
window panes of two front 
doors were smashed, the handle 
of a side door ripped off, two $35 
ash trays and various “items” 
purloined, the screen ripped 
off the front office window, 
and several basement windows 
broken.

Though 
beseiged 
by 
two 

frontal attacks, one by women, 
another by East Quadders, plush 
South Quad was marred only by 
two broken windows, reportedly 
smashed by stones. In the last 
attack, the front doors were 
showered with a barrage of mud.

At 
Alice 
Lloyd 
Hall, 

unmentionables 
as 
well 
as 

mentionables were carried off 
by the men, while Stockwell 
coeds yesterday were proudly 
displaying “souvenirs” pilfered 
from East Quad. At Victor 
Vaughan, one coed claimed she 
had to grapple with one of the 
men to prevent him from leaving 
her room with her watch.

Early 
yesterday 
morning, 

janitors at Betsy Barbour and 
Helen Newberry were solemnly 
sweeping mud, brought in on the 
men’s shoes, from the corridor 
floors. Later, it was reported that 
several students are planning 
to urge Student Legislature to 
sponsor a fund-raising campaign 
to make restitution for damages 
and theft. 

Fortunately, 
there 
were 

no serious accidents during 
the demonstrations. But Sura 
Rotenberg, ‘55, reported she 
received burns on her forearm 
when some of the men, storming 
into Vaughan House, tossed her 
into a Shower and turned on 
the hot water. Miss Rotenberg 
received first aid at Health 
Service.

And another woman student, 

Denise Buffington, ‘52, was 
bruised as she attempted to 
block the rambunctious mob 
from entering a Liberty St. 
theater, where she works as a 
cashier.

April 
13, 
1955 
- 
Final 

obstacle blocking distribution 
of Salk vaccine was removed 
late yesterday when Secretary 
of Welfare Oveta Culp Hobby 
formally licensed the vaccine for 
general use Licensing followed 
Dr. Francis’ historic report by 
only a few Hours.

Vaccine which the public will 

start receiving within a few 
days is a new, improved model 
— far better than the vaccine 
Dr. Francis said was between 80 
and 90 per cent effective. The 
1955 version of Salk vaccine can 
theoretically prevent paralytic 
polio 100 per cent, its inventor 

claimed.

Both Dr. Francis and Dr. Salk 

received long ovations following 
their reports yesterday.

State Health Commissioner 

Albert E. Heustis has ordered 
enough vaccine to accommodate 
430,000 first, second and third 
graders. 
Washtenaw 
County 

has already set up a vaccination 
program calling for cooperation 
between 
County 
Medical 

Society, 
Health 
Department, 

St. 
Joseph’s 
and 
University 

Hospitals, 
physicians 
and 

volunteer workers from the 
National Foundation.

Announcement 
of 
the 

effectiveness of Salk Vaccine 
was 
termed 
“one 
of 
the 

greatest events in the history 
of medicine” by Dr. Wright H. 
Murray, chairman of the Board 
of Trustees of the American 
Medical Association.

Give Children Priority
“Give the children priority,” 

Dr. Murray urged, cautioning 
adults against rushing to doctors’ 
offices 
immediately. 
Reports 

from pharmaceutical companies 
indicated probably 30 million 
three-shot sets of inoculations 
will be available before summer.

If Dr. Salk’s suggestion to 

give only two shots instead of 
three is followed there might 
conceivably be enough vaccine 
to handle as many as 45 million 
sets of inocuations.

Dr. 
Francis’ 
evaluation 

included 
a 
study 
of 
two 

programs included in the field 
trials. In one, half the children 
participating were given vaccine 
while the other half received 
placebo, a harmless substitute. 
In the other, second graders 
received vaccine and first and 
third graders were observed as a 
control group.

Placebo Area
Because children used as 

control (those who received 
placebo) in placebo areas were 
more nearly identical to those 
receiving vaccine than in the 
observed areas, estimates were 
obtained largely from placebo 
areas, Dr. Francis said.

March 9, 1943 - More than 

1,300 Navy Enlisted Men will 
arrive on campus on or about 
July 1 to take up training 
in 
the 
Navy’s 
specialized 

war training program, Prof. 
Marvin Niehuss, campus war 
training 
director, 
revealed 

yesterday. 
The 
University’s 

tentative training quota under 
the new V-12 program will 
include 250 NROTC students, 
900 engineers, 67 pre-medical 
students, and 400 men in 
basic 
training. 
The 
orders 

propose that the men live in 
the 950-man West Quadrangle 
which at present is completely 

occupied, according to Francis 
C. 
Shielacting 
director 
of 

Residence Halls.

telegramed 
to 
Captain 

Richard Cassidy, head of the 
Naval Science and Tactics 
department, yesterday by the 
Bureau of Naval Personnel in 
Washington. Captain Cassidy 
was requested to organize 
housing and eating facilities 
in 
the 
West 
Quadrangle 

pending contract negotiations. 
Several 
high-ranking 
naval 

officers 
were 
on 
campus 

ten days ago inspecting the 

Quadrangle and other features 
of the University plant. Prof. 
Niehuss, who is the University 
representative in all contract 
negotiations of this type, said 
that he expects the Navy to 
return to Ann Arbor in the near 
future and initiate the contract 
discussions. All trainees will 
be apprentice seamen on active 
duty receiving regular pay for 
their rank. According to the 
present tentative plans they 
will use not only the entire 
West Quadrangle but other 
University facilities, inciding 
instructors and classrooms.

When 
questioned 

concerning housing facilities 
for regular students in the 
Quadrangle 
during 
the 

summer session, Prof. Niehuss 
stated that “it is our opinion 
that all those men will be in 
uniform by that time.”

This Navy training program 

rounds out the picture of 
service training groups that 
will be stationed on campus. At 
present the Law Quadrangle, 
the Michigan Union, and the 
East Quadrangle are housing 
men in various units of the 
Army’s college war training 
program.

October 15, 1960 - ABOARD 

THE, KENNEDY CAMPAIGN 
SPECIAL-Plugging his program 
of “New Frontiers” and stressing 
econonomic growth and recovery 
of American prestige abroad, Sen. 
J F. Kennedy whistle-stopped 
through nine central Michigan 
cities yesterday.

The senator began his one-day 

tour of the state in Ann Arbor 
yesterday morning, where he 
was greeted by 5,000 cheering 
supporters. 
He 
called 
upon 

citizens to continue tributing 
“a strong and vigorous effort 
to utilize the resources in this 
country” as an example to the 
newly independent states who 
want to try a free society.

Kennedy told the cheering 

enthusiastic audiences throughout 
the state that his program was 
a progressive one, designed “to 
move this country ahead.”

Designs Proposals
He said his proposals are 

designed 
to 
coordinate 
both 

domestic and foreign policies, as 
the New Freedom of Wilson, the 
New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt 
and the Fair Deal of Truman had 
done successfully in the past.

In Jackson, the Massachusetts 

senator told the audience that he 

was running against “a man who 
runs on the slogan ‘You never had 
it so good.”’

With 
seven 
per 
cent 

unemployment in Michigan, with 
steel industries operating at 50 per 
cent of capacity and 35 per cent of 
the nation’s brightest youth not 
going to college, “who can believe 
this?” he asked.

Discusses Lapse
Kennedy 
urged 
a 
“full 

economy” to meet this economic 
lapse, and cited the need for 
25,000 new jobs a week each year 
to solve unemployment.

Ian Marshall, the Democratic 

candidate said he was running for 
the presidency because it “is the 
center of action.”

“And I think the job of the next 

president of the United States is 
to tell the, American people the 
sober facts of life, to ask of them 
a greater effort, to suggest that it 
is incumbent upon us to build our 
strength here in this country, if we 
are going to maintain ourselves,” 
Kennedy explained.

Brought Up Events
He brought up the events in 

the world which are turning 
African nations against the United 
States position and warned of 
the consequences of Red China’s 
example of growth when viewed 
by wavering countries.

“In the next 10 years, the 

balance of power in the world may 
begin to move either inevitably in 
the direction of the Communists 
or in the direction of freedom. 
That is why I think the times in. 
which we live are so important,” 
the senator emphasized.

At 
East 
Lansing, 
where 

approximately 6,000 Michigan 
State University students flocked 
to hear the presidential hopeful, 
Kennedy said the Administration 
has 
failed 
in 
disarmament 

proceedings because less than 100 
persons are working on this “most 
complicated, perhaps important 
and perhaps fruitful responsibility 
which the government now faces.”

‘No Broadcasts’
He said there have been no 

Spanish 
radio 
broadcasts 
to 

Latin America, except during the 
Hungarian crisis, in the last eight 
years and warned that the United 
States is now fourth in propaganda 
airings, behind Red nations and 
Egypt.

This 
country 
offered 
only 

200 scholarships to the whole 
Africa last year; was hesitant in 
recognizing newly independent 
nations; and has only five per 
cent of the foreign service in all of 
Africa. All this, he warned, in spite 
of the fact that Africa will have 
one-quarter of the votes in the 
United Nations in 1962.

Bipartisian Group To Protest Over Teachers’ Action, Attack Policies

Democrat’s Travels Begin in Ann Arbor, Nominee Asks 
Economic Growth, ‘Recovery of American Prestige’

September 
17, 
1956 
- 

Cramped by the growing pains 
confronting all institutions of 
higher education, the University 
has called upon North Campus 
to provide the ground space for 
its future expansion.

Located a mile north of the 

main campus, this 670-acre tract 
of rolling land has faced a blitz-
krieg attack of steam shovels, 
caterpillars and construction 
crews since University President 
Harlan Hatcher, in the spring 
of 1952, broke ground for the 
Cooley Memorial Building.

Functionally, North Campus 

structures have tended toward 
physical science, engineering, 
and graduate education.

Four Structures Completed
Four 
structures 
of 
glass 

and orange brick have been 
completed. 
In 
the 
Fall 
of 

1953, the Mortimer E. Cooley 
Building, dedicated to the Dean 
of the University’s College of 
Engineering from 1903 to 1928, 
became 
the 
first 
completed 

building on North Campus.

Most of the work within 

the building is conducted by 
the 
University 
Engineering 

Research Institute in advanced 
electronic research, ERI now 
carries on $8,000,000 of top 
secret government and industry 
research.

Phoenix Dedicated In June
Phoenix 
Memorial 

Laboratory, dedicated in June, 
1955, in memory of University 
World War II dead, functions 
as a research building for the 
peacetime uses of atomic energy. 
Alumni and public donations 
provided the $1,700,000 for the 
structure.

Dr. 
Henry 
J. 
Gomberg, 

assistant 
director 
of 
the 

Phoenix Project, says of the 
Laboratory, “There is no other 
non-governmental laboratory in 
the country like this. In it, we 
can use radiation to help create 
new materials, alter old ones, 
probe the structure of matter, 
effect genetic changes in living 
materials, and interfere with 
or kill undesired organisms or 
growths.”

Ford 
Nuclear 
Reactor, 

scheduled 
for 
completion 

this year, was financed by a 
$1,000,000 grant from the Ford 
Motor Co. and works closely 
with the Phoenix Memorial 
Laboratory. When completed, 
it will be the nation’s most 
powerful private reactor.

Inside the windowless, four 

story cube building will be 
a 
40,000-gallon 
“swimming 

pool,” 26 feet deep, 35 feet long 
and 23 feet wide. Walls for the 
‘pool’ will be six and one-half 
feet thick for the lower half and 
three and one-half feet thick at 
the top.

From a bridge across the top 

of the ‘pool’, a fuel core will be 
suspended 20 feet into water. 
Studies of neutrons and their 
effect upon matter procede from 
‘piping’ beams of neutrons away 
from the fuel core, or by placing 
materials near the core for 
neutron bombardment.

Central Services Bldg.
Third structure completed is 

the Central Services and Stack 
Building, financed by a State 
appropriation 
of 
$470,000. 

This building will facilitate the 

storage of the University’s older 
and less used books.

Last completed unit on North 

Campus was the $1,850,000 
Automotive 
Engineering 

Building, used for instruction ad 
research in the automotive and 
aeronautical fields.

Two-stories high and 400-

feet long, the structure will 
house 17 sound-proofed test 
cells, where engines will be 
surrounded by “curtains of air” 
when experiments are being 
run.

A committee composed of 

representatives from Michigan 
industries 
will 
help 
equip 

the 
Automotive 
Engineering 

Building, a fine experimental 
center in a State which is the 
automotive hub of the world.

Three units on North Campus 

should be completed yet this 
year. Aeronautical Engineering 
Laboratory, 
finished 
by 
the 

United States Air Force and by 
funds earned by; the Engineering 
Research Institute, will house 
three wind tunnels.

To General Wind Velocities
One wind tunnel will generate 

wind velocities up to 7500 miles 
an hour — ten times the speed of 
sound to be used for experiments 
in the guided missile and space 
satellite areas. Winds of 750 mph 
and 3000 mph will be whipped 
up for research and instruction 
in two other tunnels.

The subsonic tunnel is a 

tapered steel tube, reaching 20 
feet in diameter, which winds in 
a closed circle for over 300 feet 
outside the main building.

Equipment for observation 

of beach erosion, breakwater 
design and the effects of lake 
and ocean waves on various 
structures will function in the 
$4,000,000 Fluids Engineering 
Laboratory, 
now 
under 

construction.

There also will be studies 

of air pollution, heat transfer, 
air filtering solar power, fluid 
mechanics and air conditioning, 
ship 
and 
propeller 
design, 

hydraulics, 
and 
chemical 

distillation and fractionating.

Married 
Students 

Apartments 

Northwood 
Apartments, 
a 

396-unit housing development 

for married students on North 
Campus, 
is 
connected 
with 

the main campus with hourly 
bus service. This development 
will help siphon off part of 
the campuses’ load of 5,000 
family 
men-and-women. 
The 

development 
includes 
two 

sizeable parking lots and a 
playground for the project’s 
numerous children.

In 
regard 
to 
future 

development on North Campus, 
the University, in its projected 
five-year capital outlay request 
to the State Legislature, has 
asked funds for three major 
buildings.

College of Engineering, in 

1960 will ask $208,000 planning 
money for a Highway Laboratory 
and a Sanitary Laboratory.

School of Music will seek a 

$2,000,000 
appropriation 
in 

1957 to begin construction on 
its $4,500,000 building of the 
future.

A planning money request 

of $178,000 for a $4,500,000 
Architecture Building will again 
be submitted in 1957 to the 
Legislature in Lansing.

March 24, 1965 - There 

will be tired eyes and lively 
discussion tonight when the 
Faculty Committee to Stop the 
War in Viet Nam puts on its all-
night, all-morning teach-in to 
consider alternative positions to 
present American foreign policy.

But there will also be dissent. 

A bi-partisan group of “about 
100” will demonstrate at 8:30 
tonight in front of Angell Hall 
to 
protest 
“propagandizing 

under the guise of education,” 
announced Alan Sager, ‘66L, 
a member of the Executive 
Board of the University Young 

Republicans.

Sager said that members of 

the group will question speakers 
at conferences and speak out in 
defense of government policy at 
the midnight rally planned by 
the Faculty Committee.

The teach-in should have a 

good attendance. “We hope for 
at least 1000 students at the 
first conferences, and there 
may be as many as 1500,” said 
Robert Cohen, spokesman for 
the Student Committee to Aid 
the Faculty (SCAF) which has 
been signing up students in the 
Fishbowl.

Yesterday, about 35 Faculty 

Committee 
members 
spoke 

at 
housing 
units, 
sororities, 

and fraternities to ask student 
support 
for 
the 
teach-in. 

Prof. William Gamson of the 
sociology 
department 
said 

that the speakers’ requests got 
“pretty good receptions.”

Details of the teach-in are 

in an advertisement on Page 8 
of The Daily. If the weather is 
decent, the high point of the 
evening should be the midnight 
rally, SCAF member speculate.

The teach-in will primarily 

focus on alternatives to present 
American 
policies 
in 
Viet 

Nam. 
“There 
is 
widespread 

dissatisfaction 
among 
the 

faculty with present policy, but 

no consensus on what would 
be a wiser plan If you asked a 
hundred faculty members, you’d 
get a hundred different plans,” 
said Cohen.

“That is why we are holding 

the teach-in, to decide upon one 
best alternative position.” Cohen 
as- sertion, echoed by Gamson, 
was 
 
intended 
to 
answer 

objections like Sager’s that the 
teach-in was not presenting the 
other side.

SCAF officials said abridged 

copies of the State Department’s 
white paper on Viet Nam would 
be passed out in the Fishbowl 
to familiarize students with the 
case.

November 30, 1966 - Charging 

that the University administration 
refused to neet their demands, 
1,500 students packed three floors 
of the campus Administration 
Bldg. yesterday in the largest sit-in 
in the school’s history.

The 
students 
demonstrated 

in response to President Harlan 
Hatcher’s refusal to acede to their 
demands that the school cease 
compilation of class rankings for 
the Selective Service and rescind 
a controversial new sit-in ban. At 
a noon rally on the diag students 
rejected 
Hatcher’s 
conciliatory 

offer Monday to resolve the 
dispute by establishing three new 
committees as “sweet talk.”

The 
students 
at 
the 
rally 

marched on the Administration 
Bldg. after Student Government 
Council President Ed Robinson 
told them, “Last Monday’s teach-in 
asked for a yes-or no answer from 
the administration on our demands. 
I 
would 
interpret 
President 

Hatcher’s statements yesterday as 
not meeting that ultimatum,” As 
the students marched off to the 
sit-in, SGC members Robert Smith, 
‘67, and Jay Zulaff, ‘67, pleaded with 
them not to go.

About 
200 
students 
stayed 

on to hear Zulaff say, “The 
administration has started to work 
with us... We must continue to 
work with the administration.”

The students filled the lobbies, 

foyers, and some corridors of the 

first, second and third floors start- 
ing at about 12:20. Access to offices 
was largely blocked for University 
employes.

Technically the protest did not 

violate the controversial new sit-in 
ban which has been the focal point 
of the two week old dispute here.

Robinson spoke to a wide cross-

section of students in short talks 
on all three floors. He thanked 
the students’ for attending and 
said their numbers showed “a real 
committment to student decision- 
making.”

He later said that “it should be 

clear that this is just a beginning. I 
would anticipate another meeting 
Thursday night with complete 
debate and an open agenda to 
decide on further actions.”

Robinson 
received 
frequent 

applause as he told the students 
they were doing “the best thing that 
has ever been done for education 
anywhere. “He predicted that 
actions by interested students 
would continue into next semester 
“I would like to thank everyone 
who came in spite of ‘the vacation 
and the weather and Hatcher’s 
statement. 
This 
show 
a 
real 

commitment to student decision 
making,” said Robinson.

“It should be clear that this is just 

a beginning,” he added. Voicing a 
more militant stance was Students 
for a Democratic Society President 
Mike Zweig, Grad: “Next time I 
think we’ll have to have a site-in of 
indefinite duration.”

June 23, 1964 - President 

Lyndon B. Johnson collected an 
honorary Doctor of Civil Law 
degree from the University, a 
presidential endorsement from 
Henry Ford II and thunderous 
applause from 80,000 spectators 
during his morning in Michigan 
May 22.

He was here on a supposedly 

non-political mission — to deliver 
the University’s Commencement 
address — but his appearance was 
never free of political overtones 
and the peculiar mystique which 
always surrounds the President 
of the United States.

Johnson was in Ann Arbor 

barely over an hour and in 
the state only a few hours, 
but the practical and political 
preparations had begun well in 
advance.

Protecting a President
University and local officials 

worked 
with 
Secret 
Service 

personnel on security measures 
— including such tricks as 
welding shut manhole covers 
in the Michigan Stadium area, 
closing off the, Stadium almost 
a day in advance of the visit, 
scouring the Stadium with a 
“bomb squad” on the morning 

of the 22nd and even banning 
aircraft over the area during the 
President’s stay here.

Political 
jockeying 
also 

preceded the event. A protocol 
debate 
flared 
over 
whether 

Republican Gov. George Romney, 
Democratic 
Detroit 
Mayor 

Jerome Cavanagh or University 
Executive 
Vice-President 

Marvin L. Niehuss should be the 
first to greet the Chief Executive 
as he landed in Detroit (Romiley 
shook 
his 
hand 
first, 
but 

Cavanagh introduced him to the 
crowd). Other state Democrats 
scrambled to join Johnson in the 
limelight at various moments of 
his visit.

Ann Arborites Arise
Local people stepped in, too. 

Thirteen pickets from the Direct 
Action Committee, a militant 
local Negro organization, used 
the occasion to protest alleged 
police brutality; 107 other Ann 
Arborites petitioned Johnson to 
speak out on peace, poverty and 
civil rights — which the President 
indeed did, though he made no 
new policy statements. But the 
President could’ve quoted from 
the telephone book, for all most 
of the spectators cared. To them, 
the important thing was that 
the President had come to Ann 
Arbor.

November 
6, 
1962 
- 

Speaking on moral issues of 
discrimination and the future 
hopes of the American Negro 
in the civil rights struggle, the 
Rev. Martin Luther King stated 
yesterday that “the American 
dream is as yet Unfulfilled.”

He declared the basic rights 

of man are neither derived 
from nor confirmed by the 
state, but ordained by God. 
and therefore every man “is 
heir to a legacy of dignity and 
worthiness.”

King emphasized the point 

that integration is necessary 
“not only to appeal to Asia 
and Africa and to defend 
ourselves against the charges 

of Communism, but because 
racial 
discrimination 
is 

morally wrong. It substitutes 
an I-it relationship for the 
I-thou relationship.”

Develop Topic
He then developed his topic 

by explaining first that men 
must realize that the American 
dream 
involves 
the 
world 

dream of brotherhood. “We 
must learn to live together 
as brothers or we will die 
together as fools.”

Secondly, 
men 
must 

eliminate the lingering notion 
that 
there 
are 
inherently 

superior or inferior races.

Third, the United States 

must rid itself of the system of 
racial segregation. Agreeing 
that legislation cannot change 
men’s hearts, King maintained 
that law can control external 

actions.

Integration Future
Discussing the future of 

integration, 
King 
predicted 

that although the Negro has 
come a long way in reevaluating 
his intrinsic worth he still has 
a long way to go.

“The 
federal 
government 

has a great role to play if the 
problem is to be solved,” King 
said. He noted that the “only 
forthright leadership in the 
past 10 years has been from 
the judicial branch” and that 
“legislative 
and 
executive 

branches have been silent and 
sometimes hypocritical.”

He suggested that it was 

time for the President to sign 
an executive order declaring all 
segregation 
unconstitutional 

on the basis of the Fourteenth 
Amendment.

Church ‘Shame’
King was also dissatisfied 

with the role of the clergy in 
implementing 
integration, 

saying that “it is the shameful 
fact that the church is still the 
most segregated institution in 
America today.”

Discussing 
University 

President 
Harlan 
Hatcher’s 

State of the University address 
in October in which Hatcher 
said 
students 
should 
limit 

activities 
in 
the 
student 

movement, restricting them to 
the campus, King disagreed, 
saying that “students have a 
responsibility to participate 
in the movement.” He stressed 
that education is “being true 
to studies yet devoting oneself 
to a significant cause like 
integration.”

KENNETH WINTER

Co-Editor

September 20, 1968 - A 

22-man 
University 
surgical 

team began a heart transplant 
late last night in University 
Hospital. The recipient is a 
49-year old Kalamazoo man, 
Phillip T. Barnum, who has 
been prepared for such an 
operation since Aug. 8. The 
donor for the operation was a 
37 year old male, who died of 
a stroke, according to hospital 
officials. 
His 
family 
has 

requested his name remain 
anonymous. 
Barnum 
had 

been slowly dying of cardio-
myopthy, a degeneration of the 
heart muscle.

Although 
the 
hospital 

refused to officially give out the 
names of those on the 22-man 
operating 
team, 
unofficial 

sources believe the surgeon 
heading the team is Dr. Donald 
Kahn, a specialist in thoracic 
surgery.

Of the 22-man team, 10 

will work on the donor side of 
the operation, and 12 on the 
recipient Side. The operation 
began at mid-night last night, 
and no word was to be available 
on the outcome of the long and 
complicated operation until 4 
or 5 a.m. this morning.

The success of the transplant 

will hinge on the willingness 
of Barnum’s body to accept 
the new organ. The natural 
processes of the body which 
cause it to fight off simple 
infection and form protective 
pockets 
around 
embedded 

objects in the skin, will also 
cause it to attempt to reject the 
foreign heart.

In 
order 
to 
fight 
his 

phenomenon, 
doctors 
will 

administer drugs to Barnum 
which will diminish the ability 
of the body to reject the heart. 
However, these drugs also 
lower the natural barriers to 
infection. A large number of 
the patients in previous heart 
transplants 
have 
died 
not 

because of failure of the heart, 
but of complications resulting 
from later infection.

Doctors 
have 
found 
one 

drug 
which 
helps 
prevent 

the rejection of the heart to a 
large degree, while reducing 
the possibility of infection to a 
minimum. This drug, call anti-
lymphocyte globulin, (ALG), 
has been used in transplants 
in Texas with great success. 
Dr. Denton A. Cooley of Baylor 
University, who has performed 
at least nine transplants, said 
recently he would not try 

such an operation without 
ALG. However, until recently, 
ALG had been banned from 
interstate shipment by the 
Federal 
Food 
and 
Drug 

Administration. Thus doctors 
here faced the problem of 
developing their own supply, 
a long and tedious process 
according to hospital sources.

Recently, 
the 
Clinical 

Research Unit (CRU), of the 
University Hospital, in which 
Barnum was a patient, was 
closed down for lack of federal 
funds to support it. The CRU 
accepts 
only 
patients 
with 

unusual 
medical 
problems. 

The federal grant paid for the 
care of these patients, and 
the doctors were given an 
opportunity to study new and 
better treatments.

As of last night, the Barnum 

family 
was 
still 
legally 

responsible for the finances of 
the operation. However, it was 
all but assured by University 
Hospital that private sources of 
funds, and a federal allocation 
would cover the costs. The 
operating 
team 
has 
been 

prepared for such an operation 
since April. Their schedule 
called for removal of the heart 
of the donor within ten minutes 
of death.

TODAY


September 21, 1969 - A 

chanting crowd of some 12,000 
marched 
from 
Michigan, 

Stadium following yesterday’s 
football game to a peace rally in 
the Diag.

“This march expresses the 

substantial amount of anti-war 
feeling in the United States,” said 
Gene Gladstone, co-ordinator 
for the New Mobilization, which 
sponsored the march. He hailed 
the march as a huge success 
which far exceeded his original 
estimates.

Six marchers in the vanguard 

bore a symbolic casket holding 
the corpse of Uncle Sam. On 
the casket was a Nixon poster 
bearing the message “Would you 
buy a used war from this man?” 
The main block of marchers was 
preceded by a huge banner which 
read “End the War Now, Bring 

the Troops Home.”

Escorted by Ann Arbor Police 

motorcyclists and children on 
bicycles, the rally wound its way 
down East Hoover St. past two 
fraternity parties and on to the 
Diag. Marchers raised chants of 
“Peace Now” and “Join Us,” aided 
by a loudspeaker. Participants 
from SDS and Resistance added 
their own chants of “Ho Ho Ho 
Chi Minh, NLF is going to win.”

Few 
incidents 
occurred 

between peace marchers and 
those who looked on, except for a 
few anti-marcher catcalls. Police 
averted a fistfight between a 
march monitor and an onlooker 
in front of the Michigan Union.

About five thousand people 

gathered in the Diag to hear 
speakers and two rock bands, 
“UP” and “Shiva.” who set up 
on the steps of the Graduate 
Library.

Arbor City Councilman Len 

Quenon kicked off the rally by 
calling “overcommitment to the 
military and racial injustice” 
the “twin evils of our time.” He 
emphasized that “these evils can 
be found not only in Washington 
but right here in Washtenaw 
County.”

Quenon 
drew 
enthusiastic 

response from the crowd with 
comments critical of Washtenaw 
County Sheriff Douglas Harvey.

Main speaker was well-known 

peace activist David Dellinger, 
one of the “Chicago Eight.” He 
drew on a conversation of two 
years ago with Ho Chi Minh 
who, Dellinger said, “is probably 
loved by more Americans than 
either LBJ or Richard Nixon. 
Ho Chi Minh has given us the 
strength 
and 
determination 

with which to continue our 
struggle.”

Saying Nixon is “part way 

down the slippery slide which 

drove 
LBJ 
out 
of 
office,” 

Dellinger predicted that the 
November march on Washington 
“will finish the job.”

Dr. Sidney Peck, steering 

committee member of national 
Mobilization, 
demanded 

“immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal from Vietnam and 
the dismantling of all our bases 
there.” He predicted that one 
and one-half million Americans 
will participate in the November 
action in Washington.

Optimism 
regarding 
the 

success 
of 
the 
anti-war 

movement was expressed by 
Andrew Pulley, organizer of 
“GI’s United Against the War 
in Vietnam” at Fort Jackson, 
South Carolina. “We are losing 
in Vietnam and losing at home,” 
said Pulley, who also pointed 
out that many servicemen are 
being won over to the side of 
those against the war.

July 31, 1971 - Two former 

University students, David 
Scott 
and 
James 
Irwin, 

landed safely and accurately 
on the moon yesterday. Scott 
opened a lunar module hatch 
to look at the canyon banks, 
boulder fields and mountains 
around them and exclaimed 
poetically: “Oh, boy, what a 
view!”

The 
men 
achieved 
the 

moon landing at 5:16 p.m. EST 
to begin one of man’s greatest 
scientific 
expeditions, 
an 

exploration by car to the 
edge of a deep canyon and 
the base of the highest lunar 
mountains.

Before 
they 
got 
there, 

however, they ran into a 
minor difficulty with their 
spacecraft, 
as 
they 
have 

several times during their 
journey. 
A 
power 
cable 

connected from the command 
ship to the lunar lander 
broke loose. The lander was 
unable to be separated from 
the command ship until the 
command ship’s pilot Alfred 
Worden, 
found 
the 
loose 

connection and fixed it.

Back on Earth, Irwin’s 

parents read passages from 
the Bible and clutched each 
other’s hands until lander 
dropped down safely. His wife 
Mary will miss most, if not all 
of the first moonwalk today 
to fulfill a church teaching 
commitment.

“Jim is committed to his 

mission and I’m committed to 
mine,” she explained. “In the 
meantime, I’m going to bed,” 
she added, gently nudging the 
hordes of newsmen out of her 
home.

April 4, 1972 - Ann Arbor 

has always had a reputation for 
mixing politics and culture. In 
the past it has combined street 
and youth culture with radical 
politics — political rallies and 
guerrilla theater, rock and roll 
music and political speeches.

But this past weekend Ann 

Arbor saw a variation on the 
old theme — the mixing of 
youth culture and traditional, 
electoral politics in an attempt 
to keep voters keyed up for 
yesterday’s city elections.

Using rock concerts and a 

“Be-in,” organizers did their 
best to try and give people 
staying 
over 
the 
Easter 

weekend something to do. And 
their best was very good.

Uniquely, 
this 
weekend’s 

activities were not aimed at 
ending the war or stopping 
racism; they were not concerned 
with corporate recruiting or 
classified research. The main 
focus was getting out the vote.

The first part of the weekend 

festivities 
was 
not 
really 

directly related to the election. 
It was the First Annual Ann 
Arbor Hash Festival and it was 
a rousing success.

Despite what the police say, 

despite what the University 
says, and despite what the rest 
of the media says, there was a 
huge crowd braving the snow 
and cold to be out on the Diag. 
And there was a vast quantity 

of grass and hash consumed. 
But that was just setting the 
scene for the rock-and-roll bash 
at Hill Aud. Saturday night. 
Featuring the Guardian Angel, 
Wilderness 
Road, 
Spencer 

Davis and Detroit, the concert 
mixed a fine evening of music 
with constant reminders to get 
out and vote.

Guardian Angel opened the 

night, playing some fairly good 
but not exceptional rocking 
music. GA has been around the 
Ann Arbor-Detroit area for a 
long time under other names, 
and they usually do a pretty 
solid show. There were some 
good vocals and some nice 
arrangements but nothing new, 
nothing exciting about their 
music.

Happily, 
the 
same 
can’t 

be said for the next group, 
Wilderness 
Road. 
Coming 

from 
Chicago, 
Wilderness 

Road played some of the most 
imaginative and interesting 
rock I have heard lately. They 
have two very fine guitar 
players who switch off playing 
lead while the bass and drums 
provide solid, steady backing.

Mixing 
in 
some 
funny 

commercials and an Easter 
miracle, Wilderness Road kept 
the audience laughing and 
dancing in the aisles.

While the equipment was 

being changed, some of the 
city council candidates came 
onstage to urge people to vote, 
and make the youth vote felt.

The next act was a surprise 

for 
most 
people. 
Spencer 

Davis, who is best known for 
some big rock hits when Stevie 
Winwood was part of the 
group, came out and did an all 
acoustical set.

The old country and country 

blues numbers Davis did give 
the audience a nice break in 
what was otherwise a very 
high energy rock and roll 
evening. 
Despite 
spending 

almost as much time tuning his 
guitars as he did playing, Davis 
and his two backers on rhythm 
and electric bass showed a 
good understanding of the 
quite, simple music of the back-
woods.

Just before the next act was 

introduced one of their roadies 
came to the mike “cause I got a 
point to make.” His point was 
to urge everyone to register to 
vote.

“I’m not saying vote, I’m just 

saying register cause that’s 
where they pick the juries 
from,” he said. “If we ever want 
to change this country it won’t 
be at the polls, it’ll be in the 
courts - so register.”

Then came the headliners — 

Detroit, featuring Mitch Ryder, 
If Chicago typifies the music 
of the city of Chicago to some 
extent, Detroit represents the 
city of Detroit even more so. 
With their hard-driving, kick- 
ass street rock and roll De- troit 
is Detroit.

Massive rallies stay peaceful

Oct 16, 1969 - One million 

Americans 
across 
the 
country 

opposed to the Vietnam War 
marked Moratorium Day yesterday 
with demonstrations that spread 
from college campuses to city street 
corners. The demonstrations were 
generally peaceful, with scattered 
minor 
incidents 
of 
violence 

reported.

With black armbands and anti-

war buttons, participants of varying 
beliefs, militant and moderate, 
young and old, attended rallies, 
solemn vigils, marches and teach-
ins. No official estimate of the total 
participation was available, but 
reports from all over showed that 
perhaps more than one million 
Americans took an active part. 
Some Americans opposed to the 
moratorium held counter-demon-
strations, contending the anti-war 
protesters were acting against the 
national interest. Flag raisings, 
picket-lines, and burning headlights 
showed 
displeasure 
with 
the 

moratorium, which one southern 
mayor said was “giving aid and 
comfort to the enemy.” In Boston, a 
crowd police estimated at more than 
90,000 jammed the city’s Commons 
for aseries of speeches.

Sen. George McGovern. D-S. 

Dak.), told the cheering crowd “the 
most urgent and responsible act of 
American citizenship in 1969 is to 
bring all possible pressure on the 
administration to order our troops 
out of Vietnam now.”

Nearby, addressing the World 

Affairs 
Council, 
Sen. 
Edward 

Kennedy (D-Mass.) declared the 
United States should announce “an 
irrevocable decision” to withdraw 
all ground combat troops from 
Vietnam within one year, and other 
forces by the end of 1972.

In the nation’s capital, a number 

of 
demonstrations 
took 
place 

throughout the day, topped by a 
candle light march to the White 
House.

More than 3,000 persons, mostly 

young, staged a mass demonstration 
in front of the National Selective 
Service headquarters. Sitting in the 
street, they blocked traffic. Police 

stationed at intersections and along 
the sidewalks helped marshals 
keep order. Violence did break out, 
however when a group of young 
black militants at an afternoon rally 
near the White House attempted 
to break into the White House 
grounds.

Police armed with clubs made 

a number of arrests and cleared 
the demonstrators out of the 
area,sealing off a block in front of 
the Capitol.

The Washington demonstrators 

saved the best for last as 30,000 
hushed, attentive persons huddled 
on the damp, cold slope of t h e 
Washington Monument grounds 
to hear Mrs. Martin Luther King 
condemn the war.

“We spend billions of dollars for 

destruction in Vietnam,” she said, 
“but we refuse to recognize the 
necessity for life at home.” She said 
the war has destroyed the hopes of 
black and poor Americans.

After her speech, the protesters 

marched four and five abreast in a 
candlelight parade up Pennsylvania 
Avenue to the White House. In front 
of the mansion, Mrs. King lighted a 

foot-high candle.

The procession was orderly and 

the marchers obeyed traffic signals 
and police instructions.

In Detroit, mounted police were 

called to unsnarl traffic and contain 
a crowd of about 5,000 drawn to 
Kennedy Square for a protest. Some 
scattered incidents of violence broke 
out when a militant right-wing 
organization, Breakthrough, moved 
in for a counter-demonstration.

In New York City, Mayor John 

Lindsay, who had proclaimed the 
day a day of mourning, ordered the 
flags flown at half-mast. He was 
cheered as he told a Greenwich 
Village crowd that the Nixon 
administration was on a “dangerous, 
self-defeating course.”

Lindsay was attacked for his 

actions by his two opponents in 
the city’s mayoral race. Republican 
candidate 
John 
Marchi 
called 

Lindsay’s proclamation “a New 
York version of Dunkirk.” Democrat 
Mario Procaccino called it “ill-
advised.”

More 
than 
10,000 
persons 

jammed the Wall Street area for 
a demonstration which included 

the reading of a list of names of the 
American soldiers killed in the War.

Bill Moyers, press secretary to 

former President Lyndon B. Johnson 
and now publisher of the Long 
Island newspaper Newsday, called 
the moratorium a “coming together, 
at last, against the divisiveness that 
has riddled us since the advent of the 
war.”

In Chicago, where the ‘Chicago 

8’ are being prosecuted for their 
actions in last year’s Democratic 
convention 
demonstrations, 

Federal Judge Julius Hoffman and 
marshals thwarted attempts by the 
defendants, except for Tom Hayden, 
to commemorate the day.

The defendants appeared in 

court wearing black armbands and 
one of them began reading a roster 
of the war-dead, but was stopped.

Hayden, national founder of 

Students for a Democratic Society, 
last night spoke at the stadium rally 
in Ann Arbor.

Defendant 
David 
Dellinger 

jumped to his feet later in the 
proceedings and asked for a moment 
of silence in respect for the war 
dead, but was shouted down by the 

prosecution attorney and the judge.

In St. Paul, Minn. former Vice 

President 
Hubert 
Humphrey 

attended a moratorium rally at 
Macalester 
College, 
where 
he 

teaches part-time. He did not 
speak, but listened to Prof. Thomas 
Grissom call the U.S. government 
“the primary obstacle to peace in 
the world.”

Sen. Eugene McCarthy (D-Minn) 

who 
sought 
the 
presidential 

nomination last year as an anti-
war candidate, spoke to 10,000 
persons at Rutgers University, New 
Brunswick, N.J. McCarthy declared 
that although Nixon might hold 
military withdrawal from Vietnam 
to be a disaster, history “would call 
it a sign of great statesmanship.”

In Vietnam the only battlefield 

protest reported reported was 
the wearing of black armbands 
by members of a platoon of U.S. 
in-fantrymen on patrol near Chu 
Lai, some 360 miles northeast 
of Saigon. There was no way of 
knowing 
immediately, 
however, 

if there were similar antiwar 
expressions by other GTs scattered 
throughout the country.

July 12, 1985 - Now a days, you 

can’t get very far without running 
into computers. Video games and 
video game arcades taturate malls 
and inner-city skid rows around 
the country. Computer printouts 
now tell you what classes to attend, 
where to go, and when to get there. 
And if you don’t follow its orders, 
printouts will notify you that 
you’ve failed. 

Even rushing for sororities 

has become computerized. 1944 
is past, but at the University of 
Michigan, 1985 is the dawning age 
of computering. 

Starting this fall and continuing 

until the end of 1987, the University 
will try to maintain its tradition 
of staying ahead of the times and 
install computers with easy access 
for all students.

“I’d like to see computers 

available 
within 
five 
minutes 

of every student on campus,” 
said Douglas Van Houweling, 
the University’s vice provost for 
information technology. 

Although the Board of Regents 

has not yet formally approved the 
plan, they unanimously supported 
the idea when Van Houweling 
introduced it at the Regent’s June 
meeting. Under the plan, the 
University would set up “clusters of 
25-50 computers around campus,” 
Van Houweling said.

Where these clusters would be 

located, he said, hasn’t been decided 
yet, but he envisions them scattered 
in dormitories and libraries around 
campus as well as in academic 
buildings such as Angell Hall.

Currently, the University has 

250 stations available to students 
for general use — for example in 
the Michigan Union’s computing 
center. 

But Van Houweling says that 

by the end of 1987, the University 
would 
have 
increased 
the 

number of its computers seven 
fold. These new station will be 
modele after computing centers 
currently available to business and 
engineering school students. For 
a mandatory $100 fee, students in 
the two schools have access to 45 
computers set aside for general use. 

“I’ve not nothing but positive 

reactions (about the two computing 
programs),” said Regent Thomas 
Roach (D-Saline), “For a slight fee, 

students can do anything on them, 
from writing papers, to writing 
letters home. It’s a bargain.” 

But as with business and 

engineering students, access to 
computers may be a “bargain” but 
it is not free. 

Students, except those in the 

two schools, will begin paying 
computing fees; going from $50 
for winter term to $100 per term 
starting next spring.

Business 
and 
engineering 

students will also have to pay more 
for their computing, paying $50 

more in fees per term, up to $150 a 
term

But Van Houweling said that 

his plan is the most inexpensive 
way for students to have access to 
computers.

According to Van Houweling, 

only 
private 
universities 
are 

planning projects on the same scale 
as University, and they require 
students to buy computers. 

These 
cost 
about 
$3,000 

to $4,000 each, with some as 
expensive as $10,000, he said. “Our 
society is changing rapidly,”

 Van Houweling said, “so 

rapidly that you can’t go through 
any concourse in any airport in 
the country without seeing adults 
playing 
computers 
to 
amuse 

themselves.”

He said that computer literacy is 

becoming important in other areas 
besides business and engineering. 
For example, he said history 
students can now use computers 
to base their own theories, rather 
than reading other Historian’s 
theories in books.

He added that for the University, 

it’s important to preserve its 
image as a leader in technology. 
“More and more people are basing 
their decisions of what schools 
to attend according to their view 
of 
a 
university’s 
information 

technology.

He cited figures saying that most 

students who decided to come to 
the University thought that it was 
strong in computing, while most 
were accepted— but decided to go 
elsewhere— thought the University 
was weak in computering.

Some 
regents, 
however, 

including Deane Baker (R- Ann 
Arbor), said they were concerned 
that they would authorize the 
computing centers and find that 
there aren’t enough people on 
campus trained to use them.

But 
Van 
Houweling 
said 

that more and more people are 
learning how to use computers 
before coming to the University. 
In addition, he said the School of 
Literature, Science, and the Arts 
would be expanding its computer 
classes. 

Billy Frye, the University’s vice 

president for academic affairs, 
however, said that he doesn’t 
envision any mandatory computer 
classes for University students.

“Computer literacy is a short-

range problem,” Van Houweling 
said. “The number of people with 
the knowledge before coming to 
the University is increasing.”

“What 
I’m 
really 
excited 

about,” he said, “are the excellent 
computer programs in elementary 
schools.”

“Young children are already 

very 
comfortable 
with 
these 

machines,” he said, “As they grow 
up, they’re viewing computers, 
not as luxury, but as part of their 
everyday environment.”

In 
addition 
to 
expanding 

computers available to computing 
centers, 
Greg 
Marks, 
the 

University’s 
vice 
provost 
for 

information technology, said that 
students would be able to buy 
any of the line of IBM personal 
computers from the University. 

Students can now buy personal 

computers made by Apple or Zenith 
at low cost from the University’s 
microcomputer education center 
in 
the 
School 
of 
Education 

Building. Marks said that the costs 
of the computers have not been 
determined.

May 4, 1994 - A stream of cars 

on State Street tongues said it all.

Donning bright bumper stickers 

that screamed “Free Tibet” and 
license plates reading “HOWL,” 
informed observers knew the cars 
were welcome mats for the visit of 
the Dalai Lama to Ann Arbor. 

In a three-day extravaganza, 

events ranging from a general 
speech calling for demilitarization 
and world peace to discussions 
about 
what 
spiritual 
oneness 

means, the spiritual and temporal 
leader of Tibet spent April 21-23 
meeting Ann Arbor residents. 

But for students, the coming 

of the Dalai Lama happened 
to coincide with an unusual 
weekend of beautiful weather and 
finals looming on the horizon. 
Nevertheless, LSA sophomores 
Katy Fensch and Angie Palmer 
attended the Saturday discussion. 

Fensch said they went to the 

event because they are both 
interested in other cultures. 

Palmer said the Dalai Lama’s 

message of universal compassion 
and human rights is an important 
one for people of all religions and 
cultures.

The Dalai Lama, whose visit 

was sponsored by the Ann Arbor-
based Jewel Heart, emphasized a 
similar theme during the talks.

Speaking to a packed Hill 

Auditorium, the Tibetan Buddhist 
— appearing eloquently peaceful 
and at ease in both English and 
his native language — outlined his 
philosophy.

“We are from all directions and 

speak different tongues,” he noted, 
but all humans have “tremendous 
constructive potential.”

He went on to say that “from 

birth to death, we are heavily 
reliant on others’ care,” there thus 
follows the need to strive for “non-
violence and tolerance in daily life.”

The Dalai Lama sat on a panel 

consisting of impressive persons 
ranging from Ann Arbor Mayor 
Ingrid Sheldon to the poet Allen 
Ginsberg.

The life of the Dalai Lama has 

been one riven with paradox. On 
one hand, he is the 14th Dalai 
Lama, a bodhisattva who is 
supposedly exempt from the 
banes of humanity, and is on his 
earth merely to help others.

But the Dalai Lama has also 

been forced to deal with political 
realities. In 1950, as China 
invaded East Tibet and began 
systematically 
tearing 
apart 

its cultures and traditions, the 
Dalai Lama fled to India and has 
ruled in exile from there ever 
since.

Tibetan 
Buddhism 
was 

popularized on Western college 
campuses in the 1960s, as the 
counterculture and the student 
movement embraced many of the 
teachings of the Dalai Lama. But 
if the small sampling of student 
at the festivities surrounding the 
Dalai Lama’s visit to Ann Arbor 
was any indication, student 
interest has waned since then.

March 31, 1970 - Pe a c e f u l, non-

disruptive picketing of classroom 
buildings yesterday morning and 
afternoon marked the seventh 
day of the Black Action Movement 
(BAM) strike.

Later, BAM leaders, addressing 

about 1,200 people in the Union 
Ballroom, announced that they 
would resume talks with University 
officials on BAM’s demands for 
increased 
minority 
enrollment 

along with necessary recruiting, 
financial aid and tutoring services.

Negotiations between the two 

sides began at 8:40 p.m. last night. 
Meanwhile, about 200 state police 
troopers were reported to be on 
standby alert at the National Guard 
Armory.

Early yesterday morning city 

officials, BAM leaders and Vice 
President and Chief Financial 
Officer 
Wilbur 
K. 
Pierpont 

discussed “ground rules” to keep 
strike actions within the law.

In response, BAM passed out 

a mimeographed sheet in the 
morning instructing picketers not 
to block building entrances, verbally 
threaten people, disrupt classes 
or have any objects that could be 
defined as weapons.

At a noon Diag rally BAM leader 

Roger Short accused President 
Robben Fleming of trying to bluff 
strike supporters with threats of 
calling state police and the National 
Guard on campus.

“We’re dealing with a man 

That’s making a bluff,” Short told 
the crowd of about 800 people. “I’m 
not advocating anything, but when 
you’re in that picket-line think 
about that. Think about what it 
means to call police on campus.”

Yesterday’s 
activities 
began 

before dawn as strikers picketed 
dorms 
and 
Plant 
Department 

parking lots, trying to persuade 
employees not to go to work. 
Breakfast was not served at Mosher-
Jordan or Couzens, but otherwise 

dorm food service was normal.

At the Plant Department, 

workers 
listened 
to 
picketers’ 

explanations of the strike and took 
leaflets but drove through the picket 
lines to work. Picketers claimed that 
a number of plainclothes policemen 
were in the area before the strikers 
left at about 7:30 a.m. Classroom 
picketing began soon after as 
students marched or sat around 
entrances of classroom buildings in 
the Central Campus area. 

Holding signs and occasionally 

singing strike songs, the picketers 
tried to discourage other students 
and 
faculty 
members 
from 

entering classes. The picketing 
was noticeably non-militant, with 
a minor incident at Angell Hall the 
only reported disturbance during 
the day.

The demonstrators continued 

picketing throughout the day at 
the law, business and education 
schools as well as the Angell-
Mason complex, the Economics, 
Chemistry, Natural Resources, E. 
and W. Engineering, Physics and 
Astronomy, Natural Science and 
LSA Bldgs.

In the morning, strikers did not 

have success in persuading many 
people not to attend classes, but in 
the afternoon the number of pickets 
increased and class attendance 
visibly dropped.

At the noon Diag rally BAM 

leader Ed Fabre said the strike 
would continue, despite what he 
described as Fleming’s attempt to 
turn black against white students 
and students against faculty. Fabre 
said that the main issue facing 
negotiators would be handling any 
charges brought against students 
participating in strike actions.

BAM leader Madison Foster 

claimed 
the 
strike 
had 
been 

relatively non-violent and accused 
Fleming of trying to undercut 
support from BAM.

“Some 
of 
you 
have 
been 

photographed 
and 
identified—

Fleming himself admitted he had an 

informant at Rackham,” Foster told 
the crowd. “We have to demand 
that we get a mechanism to prevent 
reprisals.

In the afternoon over two dozen 

strikers picketed the University’s 
incinerator on North Campus. 
Several University garbage trucks 
were 
reportedly 
temporarily 

blocked as some drivers were 
reluctant to cross picket-lines.

Aud. A was locked by University 

personnel later in the afternoon 
after a liquid chemical, probably 
hydrochloric acid, was poured on 
several auditorium chairs.

At 5 p.m. an overflow crowd 

jammed the Union Ballroom to 
hear BAM representatives discuss 
the progress of the strike.

A mock trial was held, accusing 

“Robben Flim Flam” of “libel, 
incitement to riot, breach of contract, 
conspiracy to deprive people of their 
civil rights, usurpation of the power 
of the people and misfeasance, 
malfeasance and nonfeasance of 
public office.”

The crowd found “Flim Flam” 

guilty and the “judge” ordered 
“Flim Flam to be humanized.” 
Darryl Gorman announced that 
if agreement is reached with 
the University about the black 
demands, BAM members would 
vote among themselves whether 
to approve the agreement. A mass 
meeting of strike supporters would 
then be called to ratify any pact.

“Until we get a settlement the 

strike has got to go on,” BAM leader 
Ron Harris told the gathering. He 
called for peaceful picketing of 
classrooms today beginning at 7:30 
a.m.

“Your failure to keep this thing 

going will only result in hanging 
yourself,” Harris told the crowd, 
referring to allegations of planned 
reprisals against strikers. BAM also 
announced plans for a noon rally 
today at Rackham Amphitheater 
and another rally at 7 p.m. tonight in 
the Union Ballroom.

June 24, 2003 - Although 

celebrations by pro-affirmative 
action student groups could be 
heard across campus yesterday, 
it was not necessarily a total 
defeat for their counterparts. 

Anti-affirmative 
action 

students groups cite the U.S. 
Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling 
against 
the 
University’s 

controversial 
point 
system 

as evidence that a part of the 
University’s 
undergraduate 

admissions policy is indeed 
unconstitutional. 

Andrew 
Robbins, 
LSA 

student and co-president of the 
Jewish University Republican 
Alliance, said of his recently 
formed student group that, “we 
were a little disappointed, but 
they did strike down the point 
system, so in that regard we are 
happy.”

This 
sentiment 
was 

reiterated by Mike Phillips, 
LSA senior and publisher of 
the conservative journal The 
Michigan Review. 

“I was most against the 

undergraduate policy because 
of the quota system. He said. 

Although 
Phillips 

acknowledged the other side’s 
victory, he is apprehensive 
about the future implications 

of this ruling for the University 
and its students. 

“I am now concerned with 

what the University will be 
doing 
to 
more 
accurately 

reflect the contribution and the 
mandate,” he said. 

The 
Review’s 
editor-in-

chief, Ruben Duran, expressed 
a concern similar to that of 
Phillips. 

“(The University is going to 

find another way to get around 
it, to continue their social 
experiment to make minorities 
feel good,” he said “(They) will 
now say 19 and a half points is 
what we give,” he added. 

The split decision left room 

for optimism on both sides, but 
also created some frustrations. 

“Essentially it did nothing 

– nothing is different,” said 
Duran. “The University will 
continue to purport the idea 
of diversity which has been 
upheld as a compelling state 
interest.” 

Duran’s disappointment was 

echoed by Chip Englander, an 
LSA alum, former chairman of 
the College Republicans and 
founder of Young Americans for 
Freedom. 

“The decision is ridiculous. 

It would have been nice to get a 
clear-cut decision,” he said. 

Robbins said of the split that 

it “showed that the Supreme 
Court, like the rest of the 
country, is split on these issues.” 

Despite the split decision, the 

ruling yesterday allowed race to 
be used as a factor in University 
admissions policies. 

Phillips agreed that race was 

a factor but warned against 
giving it too much weight, “Race 
can play some role, but it can’t 
play a decision role – it needs to 
be used very narrowly,” he said. 

Although 
Phillips 
said 

he believes it’s possible to 
implement a new plan that 
takes race into consideration, 
many anti-affirmative action 
activities disagree. Duran said 
that “an even more secretive, 
subjective, 
non-transparent 

system: is too be expected. 
Robbins said that JURA is just 
looking 
for 
(an 
admissions 

policy) that is merit based. 

But 
despite 
these 
mixed 

reactions, both anti-affirmative 
action 
groups 
and 
anti-

affirmative action activists are 
pleased that the undergraduate 
point system is being modified. 

LSA 
sophomore, 
MSA 

member 
and 
College 

Republican Jesse Levine said, 
“Although I’m a Republican 
and a moderate, I feel confident 
with the decision. I’m proud to 
be a student at the University of 
Michigan.”

Regents announce Coleman as first female president

May 
30, 
2002 
- 
Mary 

Sue 
Coleman, 
president 
of 

the University of Iowa, was 
welcomed to the University by 
the University Board of Regents 
and 
community 
members 

yesterday morning as she was 
elected to be the University’s 
13th president in a motion 
carried unanimously by the 
Regents.

Coleman, 
who 
has 
been 

president of Iowa since 1995, 
will begin her term at the 
University of Michigan Aug. 1 
under a five-year contract set to 
be finalized at the June regents 
meeting.

“She will be a strong, creative, 

experienced, thoughtful and 
successful 
president 
of 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan,” 

Regent 
Rebecca 
McGowan 

(D-Ann Arbor) said. “And let it 
be said again and again, girls 
can do math and science.”

Regents also praised interim 

University President B. Joseph 
White, expressing gratitude and 
appreciation for his dedication 
and involvement in keeping the 
University running smoothly.

“The 
only 
thing 
more 

challenging 
than 
being 

president of this University 
would 
be 
being 
interim 

president,” 
Regent 
David 

Brandon (R-Ann Arbor) said.

Added Regent Kathy White 

(D-Ann Arbor) to White and his 
wife, Mary: “I’m very impressed 
at (your) deep commitment ... I 
am basically speechless,” she 
said.

Though she was officially 

appointed, 
Coleman 
will 

remain at Iowa for the next two 
months.

“I have two responsibilities 

that I have to do going forward,” 
she said, referring to both her 
position at Iowa and her need to 
prepare for her new role in Ann 
Arbor.

White will remain in charge 

of the University until the 
beginning of August but said 

he would confer with Coleman 
on any major decisions made 
between now and then.

Laurence Deitch (D-Bingham 

Farms), chair of the Board of 
Regents and the Presidential 
Search Committee, said he is 
confident Coleman is ready for 
the job.

“She 
was 
quite 
simply 

the 
best 
of 
the 
best. 
We 

think the University and the 
community will benefit from 
her leadership,” he said. “As an 
administrator, she’s smart and 
she’s tough and she knows how 
big places like this run.”

He added that Coleman is 

well-known in higher education 
circles and that her name is 
on “everybody’s short list of 
leaders of higher education.”

Deitch 
cited 
Coleman’s 

achievements and credentials 
as part of what made her 
an 
appealing 
candidate, 

commenting on the breadth 
of 
her 
experiences 
and 

involvement in research and a 
variety of other areas.

“We believe she will prove 

to be one of the great leaders 
of the University’s history,” he 
said. “We will be fortunate to 
have her.”

Regarding 
the 
search 

process, 
Deitch 
called 
the 

search “focused, thorough and 
thoughtful.”

Deitch 
also 
addressed 

the 
contributions 
of 
the 

Presidential Search Advisory 
Committee, 
composed 
of 

faculty, 
students, 
staff 
and 

alumni, which met 15 times 
over five months to investigate 
the pool of candidates.

It was “a truly extraordinary 

commitment by 16 people with 
very busy lives,” Deitch said.

The University community 

at large had a chance to be part 
of the process as well, as 25 
meetings were held to give the 
community a chance to voice 
opinions and hopes for the next 
University leader.

“The 
election 
of 
the 

next 
president 
mattered 
to 

everyone — everyone cared. It 
reaffirmed our commitment,” 
said Rackham Dean Earl Lewis, 

chair of the Presidential Search 
Advisory Committee.

Lewis said over 200 people 

were nominated and reviewed 
“in 
one 
form 
or 
another” 

in 
a 
process 
that 
“turned 

nominations into candidates.” 
He said the advisory committee 
presented a pool of candidates, 
not finalists, to the regents.

“It was a process that we 

understood required a high 
level of confidentiality,” he said. 
He added that the job of the 
search committee was to create 
a rich and deep pool full of 
candidates who were qualified 
to lead the University in many 
different ways.

Coleman said that if it had 

been an open search she would 
not have considered candidacy. 
She is not the only one who 
would have refused candidacy, 
Lewis said.

While 
Lewis 
said 
the 

openness in Harvard’s recent 
presidential 
search 
did 
not 

seem to harm former University 
President Lee Bollinger – who 
Coleman is replacing – Bollinger 
was announced last year to be a 
finalist and then lost to former 
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury 
Lawrence Summers, he believes 
Bollinger is the exception to the 
rule.

“Everyone 
involved 
are 

people who are themselves in 
a position of responsibility,” 
Lewis said. “In many other 
instances, individuals will find 
themselves 
compromised 
if 

they are publicly identified as 
a candidate in a public search.”

When asked about a list of 

finalists, 
Deitch 
would 
not 

offer a list but said “there is 
one finalist and she is with us 
(now).”

Making a list of candidates 

public, 
even 
after 
the 

announcement, would violate 
a promise to those who chose 
to accept their nominations, 
Lewis said.

Though she said she never 

intended to leave Iowa and 
was not looking for another job 
when 
University 
committee 

members asked her to consider 
the 
position, 
Coleman 
said 

she is happy to be part of 
the 
University 
community 

and looks forward to “the 
experience of a lifetime.”

“I just wanted you to know 

what a thrill this is,” she said, 
adding that part of the thrill 
of being elected University 
president 
comes 
from 
her 

passion for public university 
education.

“I have to tell you, when I 

called my mother, my 88-year-
old mother — she lives in 
Colorado - she cried and she 
understood what it meant to 
be named president,” Coleman 
said.

“Iowa is a fabulous place to 

be,” she added. “I was very happy 
at Iowa. Many good things were 
happening at Iowa. ... I agreed 
to become a candidate because 
the University (of Michigan) 
is such a great university,” she 
said.

As president at Iowa, Coleman 

said she was involved with 
students on a number of levels, 
ranging from making Madonna 
videos of herself for the school’s 
Dance Marathon to working 
with student organizations and 
student government to making 
herself available for student 
comments.

The president always makes 

an appearance at the school’s 
Dance Marathon, she said. “I 
always make a fool of myself,” 
Coleman added.

Besides 
her 
Madonna 

impersonation, Coleman said 
there are other things she would 
like the student body to know 
about her. “I’d like students to 
know that I’m an open person, 
accessible, that I care about the 
ideas students have,” she said.

At Iowa, she visited sororities 

and 
fraternities, 
answered 

student 
email 
and 
started 

a 
Fireside 
Chats 
program 

co-sponsored by the University 
of Iowa student government, 
where 500 students a month 
are invited to informally meet 
and discuss topics of interest, 
she said, adding that the event 
is publicized and open to all 
student, regardless of if they 
receive an invitation, she said.

Coleman is the first woman 

president at the University, but 
said she did not feel that being a 
woman holding the title would 
change the job description.

“This is a hard job, a stressful 

job for men and women and 
I think the pressures are the 
same,” she said.

With 
regard 
to 
issues 

the 
University 
is 
currently 

facing, including the Martin 
conviction, Coleman said she 
looks forward to the challenges 
as opportunities.

“I am committed to having 

the truth come out and I am 
dedicated to making it right 
because that’s what we should 
do,” she said.

As far as the president’s role 

in the Ed Martin investigation 
and other issues, she said 
integrity is a central issue.

“The president is going to 

be involved with the regents to 
see that the information comes 
out. It is extremely important 
for the public to have absolute 
confidence in the integrity of 
the University,” she said.

“I believe in everything that 

the University does ... it should 
have a standard of excellence,” 
she added.

Priorities for her upcoming 

term, she said, will include 
getting 
search 
committees 

underway to fill leadership 
vacancies 
within 
the 

administration and immersing 
herself 
in 
the 
University 

community 
and 
University 

issues to “bring myself up to 
speed.”

Coleman will be receiving 

an annual salary of $475,000. 
White 
and 
Bollinger 
each 

received $326,000 a year.

February 15, 2005 - Arthur 

Miller, one of the University’s 
most distinguished alumni and a 
leading force in American theater, 
died in his Roxbury, Conn., home 
Thursday night at age 89. The 
Associated Press reported heart 
failure as the cause of his death. 

The prolific playwright was 

born Oct. 17, 1915 to a prominent 
Polish-Jewish family in Harlem. 
He is best known for writing “All 
My Sons,” “Death of a Salesman” 
– which earned him a Pulitzer 
Prize – and “The Crucible.”

Before he made his Broadway 

premiere in 1944, he developed 
his writing skills as a University 
student from 1934 to 1938. 

He 
found 
the 
University 

alluring because of its Hopwoods 
Awards, creative-writing prizes 
given to students with a cash 
reward. 
The 
awards 
were 

established in 1931 in memory of 
dramatist Avery Hopwood. 

“This place seemed, because of 

the Hopwood Award, to be taking 
writing seriously,” Miller said 
during a visit to Ann Arbor last 
April. 

When financial constraints 

kept him in Ann Arbor one spring 
break, Miller found himself 
with enough free time to write 
a play, he recalled in his 1987 
autobiography, “Timebends” 

He 
submitted 
the 
highly 

autobiographical 
play, 

“No Villain,” about a coat 
manufacturer 
and 
shipping 

clerks’ strike, to the Hopwood 
Awards Committee in 1936 
under the pseudonym Beymom. 
The play won him $250 and the 
minor award for drama. 

In his book “Arthur Miller’s 

America: Theater and Culture in 
the Time for Change,” Theater 
and English Prof. Enoch Brater 
writes that a judge said the play 
possessed “an excellent modern 
theme handled with a tender 
insight into character.”

His 
subsequent 
Hopwood 

Award came a year later for 
“Honors at Dawn,” submitted 
under the pseudonym Corona. 
The play focused on working 
class issues, a theme Miller 
returned to in many of his 

other works. It draws on both 
his experiences working in an 
automobile parts warehouse 
and his time at the University. 

He made a third and final 

attempt to secure a Hopwood in 
1938 for a prison play titled “The 
Great Disobedience” but did not 
win. 

Miller had arrived at the 

University two years after his 
high school graduation from 
Brooklyns’ Abraham Lincoln 
High School, where he was 
a sub-par student – he failed 
algebra three times. Miller 
hadn’t seen any plays to speak 
of, “maybe two or three plays in 
my life.” 

Hoping 
to 
further 
his 

development as a writer, Miller 
joined The Michigan Daily’s 
news staff. The byline “Arthur 
A. Miller” first appeared May 
21, 1935, in an article titled 
“Anti-Red Bill Sent to Senate.” 

“When I worked for the Daily 

I did just general reporting, and 
I was the night editor fo a while. 
And I got to write some good 
stories abot all sorts of stuff,” 
Miller told the Daily in 2000.

In his book, Brater writes, 

“Miller’s reporting for The 
Michigan Daily falls rather 
neatly 
into 
two 
separate 

categories: one dealing with 
campus events and information 
of a nonpolitical nature, the 
other reflecting his growing 
commitment and attraction to 
progressive causes.”

Miller eventually lost interest 

in journalism – which was his 
major until switching to English 
in 1936 – and his last piece to 
appear in the Daily ran on May 
31, 1937, as a letter to the editor 
supporting a labor sit-down 
strike in Washtenaw County. 

“He said he stopped writing 

for the Daily because he didn’t 
like sticking to the facts. He 
much preferred making things. 
The rest, you know, is history,” 
Brater said. 

Miller’s 
reputation 
as 
a 

playwright began to take shape

November 
9, 
2006 
- 

University President Mary Sue 
Coleman pledged yesterday that 
the University would fight the 
implementation of Proposal 2 in 
the courts.

A defiant Coleman addressed 

thousands who gathered on the 
Diag about the potential impact 
of the constitutional amendment 
that will ban affirmative action 
programs in Michigan.

The 
administration’s 

immediate concern is trying to 
delay the implementation of the 
amendment so all of this year’s 
applicants will be evaluated under 
the same admissions guidelines. 
The constitutional amendment 
will likely take effect in late 
December; depending on the date 
the Secretary of State certifies 
the election results. If this 
happens, the University would be 
forced to change its admissions 
policies halfway through the 
admissions cycle – a scenario the 
administration desperately wants 
to avoid.

“Today, I have directed our 

General Counsel to consider 
every legal option available to us,” 
Coleman told the crowd.

Because the potential impact 

of Proposal 2 has been known 

for 
months, 
many 
observers 

expected swift legal action by the 
University yesterday to maintain 
the continuity of this year’s 
admissions process.

But it was the radical pro-

affirmative 
action 
group 
By 

Any 
Means 
Necessary, 
not 

University lawyers that went to 
the U.S. District Court in Detroit 
yesterday afternoon to try to 
block the implementation.

A spokesperson for BAMN 

did 
not 
return 
phone 
calls 

for comment on the lawsuit 
yesterday. 

In an interview after her 

address, Coleman said she was 
unsure 
when 
the 
University 

would file its first legal challenges 
to Proposal 2, but she expected 
she would know within a few 
days.

“The lawyers are working hard 

on this,” Coleman said.

Officials at the University of 

California and the University 
of Texas systems successfully 
delayed 
the 
bans 
on 
their 

affirmative action programs in 
the courts until after completing 
their admissions cycles.

Coleman said she is optimistic 

the courts would side with the 
University and allow this year’s 
admissions cycle to continue 
unaffected by Proposal 2.

But such an outcome is not 

necessarily certain.

Any legal action brought by 

the University against Proposal 2 
would name the state of Michigan, 
represented by Attorney General 
Mike Cox, as the defendant.

Cox, 
a 
Republican 
who 

was elected to a second term 
Tuesday, has actively opposed the 
University’s affirmative action 
policies in the past.

In a rare act of defiance by an 

Attorney General, Cox refused 
a 2003 request by Jennifer 
Granholm to author an amicus 
brief on behalf of the state 
supporting the University in 
Gratz v. Bollinger.

This year Cox was the only 

statewide candidate from a major 
party that openly supported 
Proposal 2.

Cox could not be reached for 

comment yesterday.

Doug 
Tietz, 
a 
spokesman 

for the Michigan Civil Rights 
Initiative, 
criticized 
Coleman 

yesterday for trying to “trump 
the opinion of 58 percent of the 
electorate.”

Looking to the long term, 

Coleman 
reiterated 
the 

University’s 
commitment 
to 

diversity.

The University’s most famous alum never forgot his roots

Acclaimed alum dies at 89

January 4, 2007 - University 

alum 
and 
former 
President 

Gerald Ford, who sought to 
restore trust in the presidency in 
the aftermath of one of the most 
scandal-ridden administrations 
in American history, died at his 
home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
on Tuesday. He was 93.

When asked in 1995 what his 

greatest accomplishment was 
as president, Ford said it was 
“healing America.”

And 
heal 
America 
he 

did. 
Ford’s 
decent, 
honest 

Midwestern demeanor calmed 
a nation beset by a deep unease 
after the traumas of Vietnam 
and Watergate.

The cause of Ford’s death has 

not been released, but he had 
been 
hospitalized 
repeatedly 

over the past year.

Ford was never elected to the 

presidency or vice presidency. 
In 1973, Nixon appointed then-
Congressman Ford to take the 
place of Vice President Spiro 
Agnew after bribery charges 
forced Agnew to resign.

His 
presidency 
will 
be 

remembered most for a single 
act – the decision to grant Nixon 
an unconditional pardon for 
all crimes he committed while 
president. The pardon sparked 
a national outcry and sent Ford’s 
approval ratings plummeting. It 
likely cost him the 1976 election 
to Jimmy Carter.

Now, the pardon has become 

widely viewed as a necessary 
step to prevent the nation from 
having to see a former president 
in court for years.

Ford received a John F. 

Kennedy Profile in Courage 
award for the decision in 2001. 
Massachusetts 
Sen. 
Edward 

Kennedy, who had criticized 
Ford when he granted the 
pardon, said the decision was 
“an extraordinary act of courage 
that historians recognize was 
truly in the national interest.”

Ford 
graduated 
from 
the 

University in 1935 with a double 
major in economics and political 

science. He played center on 
a football team that won two 
national championships. Ford 
was named the team’s most 
valuable player in 1934. The 
University retired his jersey, 
number 48, in 1994.

He came to Ann Arbor in the 

middle of the Great Depression 
from his boyhood home in Grand 
Rapids with just $200 in hand. 
Half of that was for tuition. His 
football coach helped him find 
jobs washing dishes and waiting 
tables.

One of the places where 

Ford washed dishes was his 
fraternity house, Delta Kappa 
Epsilon. Ford was also a member 
of Michigamua, the elite senior 
society.

Ford turned down offers to 

play for the Green Bay Packers 
and the Detroit Lions after 
graduation. Instead, he headed 
east to Yale University, where he 
was an assistant football coach 
and student at the law school.

After serving in the Navy 

during World War II, Ford 
returned 
to 
Grand 
Rapids 

and opened a law firm. He 
was elected to Congress from 
Michigan’s 5th District in 1948, 
a seat he held until assuming the 
vice presidency.

Ford remained close to the 

University throughout his life.

He spoke at commencement 

ceremonies in May 1974 and 
kicked 
off 
his 
re-election 

campaign in September 1976 in 
front of a crowd of more than 
15,000 at Crisler Arena. He 
returned to Ann Arbor to speak 
at 
forums 
and 
conferences 

throughout his retirement.

Since 1977, Ford has held the 

title of adjunct political science 
professor. Ford’s presidential 
library is located on North 
Campus, and the Gerald R. Ford 
School of Public Policy is named 
for him. The Ford Presidential 
Museum is in Grand Rapids.

Ford School Dean Rebecca 

Blank praised Ford “The Ford 
School community has been 
enriched by our connections 
with 
President 
Ford,” 
she 

said. “His visits here helped 

our students learn about the 
complexities of policymaking 
and understand the role of 
politics in our society. President 
Ford’s commitment to public 
service was a hallmark of his 
entire career.”

University President Mary 

Sue Coleman said Ford was 
a strong contributor to the 

University community.

“I am deeply saddened by 

his death but grateful for his 
many years of inspiration to his 
University,” Coleman said in a 
written statement. “I have had 
the great privilege of knowing 
both President Ford and Mrs. 
Ford. 
An 
ardent 
Michigan 

football fan, President Ford 
was equally passionate about 
interacting with students on 
issues of public policy and world 
affairs.”

Coleman also noted Ford’s 

support for the University’s 
use of affirmative action in its 
admissions decisions.

Ford published an op-ed piece 

in the New York Times in 1999 
condemning two lawsuits filed 
against 
the 
University 
that 

challenged its use of affirmative 
action. “At its core, affirmative 
action should try to offset 
past injustices by fashioning a 
campus population more truly 
reflective of modern America 
and our hopes for the future,” 
Ford wrote.

Ford’s stance on affirmative 

action was indicative of his 
moderate Republican leanings. 
Both he and his wife, Betty 
Ford, 
were 
supporters 
of 

abortion rights. In 1976, Ford 
faced a primary challenge from 
the more conservative Ronald 
Reagan, whom he defeated.

Ford did not attend a single 

social event at the White House 
during Reagan’s eight years in 
office.

Ford 
survived 
two 

assassination 
attempts 
in 

September 1975.

It was Ford who presided over 

the removal of the last American 
troops from Vietnam in April 
1975. After the fall of Saigon, 
Ford called on Americans to put 
the nation’s first real military 
defeat behind them.

“I 
ask 
that 
we 
stop 

refighting the battles and the 
recriminations of the past,” 
he said in a speech at Tulane 
University. 
“I 
ask 
that 
we 

look now at what is right with 
America, at our possibilities and 
our potentialities for change and 
growth and achievement and 
sharing. I ask that we accept the 
responsibilities of leadership as 
a good neighbor to all peoples 
and the enemy of none.”

Ford 
echoed 
Abraham 

Lincoln’s 
second 
inaugural 

address, saying “the time has 
come to look forward to an 
agenda for the future, to unify, 
to bind up the Nation’s wounds, 
and to restore its health and its 
optimistic self-confidence.”

The Associated Press reported 

Wednesday 
that 
plans 
are 

underway for Ford’s body to lie 
in state in the Capitol Rotunda 
on Saturday. A state funeral will 
likely be held on Tuesday in the 
National Cathedral. After that, 
his body will travel to Grand 
Rapids, where he will be to be 
buried.

Ford is survived by his wife 

Betty, his daughter Susan and 
his sons Michael, John and 
Steven.

Plans for a memorial at the 

University have not yet been 
announced.

“I was an undergrad here in the 
early ’90s, and reflecting back to 
my experience at that time, I feel 
like the Bicentennial is the time 
to celebrate that the University 
of Michigan is a place where 
people can come and reach their 
potential...I’m now in the fortunate 
position of helping other students 
do that. So when I think about the 
Univeristy of Michigan and what 
I would celebrate about it, is that 
it’s a place for people to come and 
if they want to they can embrace 
all of the opportunities to learn 
about the most pressing social and 
political issues of our time, how to 
think about them, and to grow both 
personally and collectively.”

“So the Bicentennial at it’s core 
is about the celebration of the 
University and it’s history. I 
feel that while it is important 
to celebrate the wonderful 
work the University has done, 
it is also important to embrace 
the ways we have improved 
from faulty and problematic 
parts and components of our 
past. We still have much to 
improve on, and I hope that 
the Bicentennial provides an 
avenue for student leaders and 
activists to engage with the 
community and pave a positive 
future for our Michigan.”

November 20, 2013 - University 

students took to Twitter in droves 
Tuesday afternoon to share their 
experiences as Black students in 
Ann Arbor and bring attention 
to issues of race and diversity on 
campus using the hashtag #BBUM.

“Being Black at the University 

of Michigan has many shades 
and many levels to what someone 
might want to speak on it,” said 
LSA senior Eric Gavin. “It can go 
from someone being the only Black 
person in their class to someone 
with no problems at all.”

The campaign, initiated by the 

University’s Black Student Union, 
has built up over the past few 
days before trending nationally 
on Twitter Tuesday. The hashtag 
gained 
momentum 
after 
the 

student organization distributed an 
e-mail to community members and 
other campus groups encouraging 
them to participate in the online 
conversation.

LSA 
senior 
Tyrell 
Collier, 

BSU’s president, said the #BBUM 
campaign was planned to raise 
awareness of the experiences of 
Black students and for the BSU to 
collect subjective data it can couple 
with University statistics to address 
pressing issues Black students face.

Collier said BSU encouraged 

students to tweet both negative and 
positive experiences, though the 
tweets have been predominantly 
negative, which he expected.

He said the issue is especially 

pressing on campus because while 
the University frequently discusses 
ways to increase diversity, many 
communities have yet to witness 
tangible results.

“I would like to see the lives 

of Black students valued more,” 
Collier said.

By 10 p.m., over 10,000 tweets 

included the hashtag from Ann 
Arbor and beyond.

“I don’t think this is a problem 

specific to the University, I think 
it’s an experience that Black 
students at predominantly White 
universities across the nation are 
facing,” he said of the far-reaching 
responses.

Black 
enrollment 
at 
the 

University has fallen precipitously 
over the past decade largely due 
to Proposal 2, an amendment to 
the state constitution that bans 
affirmative action policies that 
was passed by Michigan voters 
in 2006. The proposal, formally 
named the Michigan Civil Rights 
Initiative, bars the University from 
considering race in its admissions 
process.

Immediately after the passage of 

the proposal, University President 
Mary Sue Coleman gave a dramatic 
address on the Diag promising 
to 
maintain 
the 
University’s 

commitment to diversity. However, 
the institution has been unable 
to stanch the decline in minority 
enrollment through alternative 
outreach policies in the wake of the 
affirmative action ban.

In Fall 2006, Black students 

made up around seven percent of 
the 
undergraduate 
population. 

In 
Fall 
2013, 
the 
University 

reported that Black undergraduate 
enrollment had fallen to 4.65 
percent. 
Hispanic 
enrollment 

as a percentage of the overall 
undergraduate body also declined 
over the same period.

At a search forum for the next 

University president in September, 
the Presidential Search Advisory 
Committee — which includes the 
University’s Board of Regents — 
heard from a number of students 
about diversity issues. Several 
student speakers at the event said 
many minorities feel they lack a 
voice on campus and occasionally 
experience bias incidents with both 
students and instructors.

Collier 
said 
the 
University 

has not yet contacted BSU about 
Tuesday’s campaign. University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 

stressed that the University’s next 
step will be to listen to the students 
and their experiences on campus.

“I think at this point the listening 

is the most important part and how 
we might respond is the next step 
and we haven’t gotten there yet,” 
Fitzgerald said.

He said the University is 

aware of students’ concerns and 
recognizes that there is always 
room for improvement in any 
organization.

However, 
the 
University’s 

social media team responded to 
the campaign via Twitter Tuesday 
afternoon: “Thanks for engaging in 
this conversation. We’re listening, 
and will be sure all of your voices 
are heard. #BBUM”

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
the 

University’s vice president for 
student life, created a Twitter 
account late Tuesday to address the 
issue.

“Got on Twitter to hear and 

support your voices. Proud of our 
students. More later,” Harper 
wrote.

LSA senior Eric Gavin, BSU’s 

public relations chair, said several 
recent campus events spurred the 
organization to plan a campaign, 
including a recent controversy 
involving 
Theta 
Xi 
fraternity 

members who branded a party with 
racialized images and words.

BSU also timed its Twitter 

campaign to correspond with a 
forum this evening hosted by the 
Department of Afroamerican and 
African Studies, the Black Student 
Union, We are Michigan and 
Students of Color of Rackham.

BSU hopes to not only engage 

members of its organization but 
also Black campus leaders from 
an array of groups, Gavin said. 
However, leaders didn’t believe the 
student organization would receive 
national attention for its efforts.

“I definitely could not have 

foreseen the national attention 
we have garnered in such a short 
amount of time,” Gavin said. “We 
felt it necessary to push for an 
initiative that would bring more 
awareness to these issues and to the 
larger Black community.”

Though 
traditional 
methods 

such as campus demonstrations 

play a role in raising awareness, 
Gavin said BSU decided social 
media could serve as an additional 
method for sparking dialogue.

“It kept it open ended and that’s 

why it so successful,” Gavin said. 
“The hashtag leaves for open ended 
interpretation so people can say 
what they feel instead of imposing 
somebody’s thoughts on them.”

So far, students have voiced an 

array of perspectives.

“Being Black at the University 

of Michigan has many shades and 
many levels to what someone might 
want to speak on it,” Gavin said. 
“It can go from someone being the 
only Black person in their class to 
someone with no problems at all. 
It’s a spectrum, but we want people 
to be aware of everyone’s different 
ideas on the issue of being Black at 
the University of Michigan.”

Renowned journalist Michele 

Norris, the creator of the Race 
Card Project — a nationwide 
initiative that gathers perspectives 
on race and aims to foster dialogue 
on 
the 
subject 
— 
partnered 

with the University during last 
winter’s theme semester on race, 
and will give the 2013 Winter 
Commencement address.

In a form similar to BSU’s 

campaign, Norris used Twitter 
to broaden the reach of the Race 
Card Project because she said even 
though the social media platform 
only allots users only 140 characters, 
it’s a powerful way to stimulate 
uncomfortable conversations.

“I used to say the most productive 

conversations are the private ones, 
but Twitter made me rethink that,” 
Norris said.

Norris noted that the University 

did not “take cover” once the 
dialogue took off, but rather 
embraced 
the 
campaign 
and 

encouraged 
students 
to 
take 

part in the conversation, which 
is not always the norm for large 
institutions.

“This is an honest conversation,” 

she said. “They wanted to see an 
honest conversation and that’s 
what this is, as uncomfortable as 
this may be for people to read about 
this.”

She said diversity has been an 

issue on every college campus she 
has visited, and after reading the 
tweets from Tuesday’s discussion 
at Michigan, it is likely the topic 
isn’t going to subside once the 
Twitter debate dies down.

“It 
really 
was 
not 
just 

people talking about their own 
experiences, but it turned into an 
actual dialogue,” she said. “People 
were talking to each other and 
perhaps even learning from each 
other, 
and 
more 
importantly 

listening to each other.”

Norris added that she will 

likely address the issue in her 
commencement 
address 
next 

month.

By asking students to share their 

experiences as Black students on 
campus, BSU is hoping to not only 
bring light to challenges, but also to 
call other student leaders to action.

“We want to get the awareness 

out so we can begin to move 
forward and actually do tangible 
things,” Gavin said.

#BBUM goes viral on Twitter

SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

November 5, 2008 - It was 

through 
tears, 
screams 
and 

complete elation that Kinesiology 
sophomore 
Carolyn 
McCloud 

processed the realization that the 
nation elected a Black president.

Speechless, she dropped to her 

knees in the midst of hundreds of 
students gathered on the Diag just 
after 11 p.m. last night, and prayed 
to God, grateful that Barack Obama 
was elected the next president of 
the United States.

While 
she 
knelt, 
students 

erupted in deafening chants of 
“Yes we did!” and “Obama!” which 
soared in volume over chaotic 
cheers, screams and tears.

Shortly 
after 
Obama 
gave 

his 
acceptance 
speech 
near 

midnight, a band of percussionists, 
a saxophonist and a tag-a-long 
didgeridoo player headed to the 
Diag playing a jazz version of the 
National Anthem. The hundreds 
already gathered at the center of 
campus circled the band.

Students continued to pour 

into the Diag from all directions, a 
few waving large American Flags. 
A handful of University police 
monitored the crowd, including 
one car parked on a path between 
the Diag and West Hall. The crowd 
remained peaceful, yet rowdy as 
police watched.

A group of students formed a 

drumline on the steps of the Harlan 
Hatcher Graduate Library, while 
hundreds of students alternated 
chants of “Go-bama!” and “Yes we 
can!” to the beat.

After receiving text messages, 

a group of students encouraged 
those gathered to go to the streets. 
Students were asking each other 
for a destination but no one seemed 
to know — or care where the crowd 
was heading. Some headed to 
Michigan Stadium, others to the 
intersection of State Street and 
Liberty Street.

One group marched to the steps 

of the Michigan Union, clogging 
State Street and chanting, “It’s 
great to see an Obama victory.” A 
portion of the crowd walked along 
toward the home of University 
President Mary Sue Coleman and 
called for her to make a speech. 
She never emerged and the group 
soon moved eastward on South 
University Avenue.

The crowds and celebrations, 

though numerous and disparate, 
only grew through the evening as 
national results came in.

As of 4 a.m., Obama had won 338 

electoral votes, well above the 270 
needed to secure the presidency. 
Republican nominee John McCain 
clinched 163 votes.

In the crucial fight for swing 

states, 
Obama 
nearly 
swept 

Republican 
nominee 
McCain, 

though not by substantial margins 
in individual states. Obama took 
Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and 
Virginia. As of 4 a.m., North 
Carolina, Missouri and Indiana 
were too close to call.

Students cheered well into the 

early morning hours, celebrating 
the 
Democratic 
candidate’s 

decisive victory.

“I feel this is the greatest 

moment of our lives,” said LSA 
sophomore Rose Balzer. “There’s 
no doubt about that.”

While 
students 
rejoiced 
in 

the streets, singing “The Star-
Spangled Banner” and choruses of 
“The Victors,” results trickled in 
from Ann Arbor precincts, showing 
a 14-percent increase from the 
number of people who cast ballots 
at student dominated polling places 
of 2004.

Eighty-three percent of voters 

at 14 student-heavy Ann Arbor 
precincts supported Obama.

Obama, whose victory in the 

Electoral College entered landslide 
territory, began the race two years 
ago as the underdog. He had to 
defeat the favored Sen. Hillary 
Clinton of New York to win the 
Democratic Party’s nomination. 
In doing so, he defied historical 
precedent to become the first Black 
man to earn a major party’s nod.

The Democratic nominee once 

again defied political paradigm 
in his campaign strategy. He 
energized an entire generation of 
young Americans with his message 
of hope and change.

During his acceptance speech 

last night, given before a crowd 
of more than 240,000, Obama 
implored Americans to support him 
as he carries out his progressive 
platform.

“I will ask you to join in the work 

of remaking this nation, the only 
way it’s been done in America for 
221 years — block by block, brick by 
brick, calloused hand by calloused 
hand,” he said.

Obama’s 
platform, 
which 

centers on tax breaks for middle-

income 
families, 
health 
care 

policy reforms, withdrawal from 
Iraq and developing alternative 
energy technology, has resonated 
overwhelmingly with young voters.

About two-thirds of voters 

under the age of 30 supported 
Obama, representing 17 percent of 
the national electorate.

This group of young, primarily 

first-time voters, who formed their 
political opinions under a president 
with some of the worst approval 
ratings in the history of approval 
ratings, voted for the young first-

Many of these people not only 

voted for him, but they dedicated 
themselves to getting him elected.

Membership in the University’s 

chapter of College Democrats 
quadrupled in size when the school 
year began. At the group’s first 
mass meeting, they turned away 
more than 100 people because they 
couldn’t fit the 300 people wanted 
to help elect Obama in one room.

Collectively, 
the 
group 

committed tens of thousands of 
man-hours to canvassing and 
phone-banking for the candidate. 
More than 30 College Democrats 
members considered the mission a 
full-time job.

In his acceptance speech, Obama 

thanked them for their efforts.

“It grew strength from the young 

people who rejected the myth of 
their generation’s apathy who left 
their homes and their families for 
jobs that offered little pay and less 
sleep,” he said of those who worked 
for his campaign.

College-aged supporters across 

the nation contributed to the largest 
volunteer base of any political 
campaign. The Obama campaign 
also used technology like social 
networking to build a registration, 
outreach and turnout machine the 
likes of which no democracy has 
ever seen. These grassroots efforts 
mobilized entire blocs of first-time 
voters.

The 
18- 
to 
24-year-old 

demographic has never played such 
an influential role in the election 
of a president. Historically, young 
voters haven’t shown up to the 
polls.

Voter turnout among those 

aged 18-24 has trailed that of 
voters aged 25 years and older by 
about 20 percent for the past 30

years, according to the Center for 
Information and Research on Civic 
Learning and Engagement.

But to combat this group’s 

infamous 
apathy, 
Obama’s 

campaign, armed with record-
shattering 
fundraising 
totals, 

poured money into courting the 
youth vote. His campaign produced 
and 
distributed 
youth-specific 

literature, which listed his pledges 
to make college more affordable and 
accessible. He used text messaging 
and viral videos to get his message 
out to a group of people whose lives 
revolve around blogging, instant 
messaging and social networking.

On a campus scattered with 

Obama campaign literature and 
plastered 
with 
the 
president-

elect’s likeness, students celebrated 
throughout the streets of Ann Arbor 
in droves. Their chants and yells 
could be heard for hours after the 
major news networks called the race 
for Obama.

Before 
flooding 
the 
streets, 

students gathered at campus bars 
and residence hall lounges to watch 
results trickle in.

Hours before television and 

Internet news outlets declared 
Obama 
the 
winner, 
College 

Democrats members were already 
celebrating an expected victory.

As CNN projected Ohio would go 

to Obama just after 9 p.m., the group 
of 50 people cheered raucously.

“Ohio kind of seals the deal,” said 

Danny Abosch, a School of Music, 
Theatre and Dance sophomore and 
a member of the group’s executive 
board. “Looking at the 2000 and 
2004 elections, Ohio has really been 
the key state. It’s really amazing.”

Just before 11 p.m., the election-

watching crowds at Good Time 
Charley’s braced themselves for the 
closing of polls in California.

March 29, 2016 - Far away from 

the hills and hot weather of Silicon 
Valley, where Google has made 
headlines with their driverless car 
testing, the University of Michigan 
is helping bring the national 
spotlight on the race to build 
driverless cars to the state.

On 
the 
University’s 
North 

Campus there’s a 32-acre urban 
environment with freeways, dirt 
roads, road signs and highway 
tunnels — known as “Mcity.” 
The field grabbed national and 
international attention when it 
opened in July 2015, becoming the 
world’s first site designed for the 
purpose of testing driverless cars.

But why here?
The University did not build 

Mcity alone. Mcity was designed 
and developed by the University’s 
Mobility Transformation Center, 
a research partnership between 
industry 
and 
government 
to 

improve 
transportation 
safety 

and sustainability. The Michigan 
Department 
of 
Transportation 

partnered with MTC to create 
and help fund Mcity, and the site is 
currently led by corporate partners 
like Ford, Toyota, State Farm 
Mutual Automobile Insurance and 
General Motors.

In partnership with prominent 

auto 
industries 
in 
Southeast 

Michigan and the city, state and 
federal 
governments, 
Mcity 

represents the ways local leaders 
are working to usher in a new era 
of transportation in the same area 
that Henry Ford redefined mobility 
over a century ago.

How the University leads 

driverless car development

Alongside 
Mcity’s 
various 

highways, intersections and dirt 
roads sit graffiti covered road signs, 
steep hills and building facades 
that can be brought just inches 
away from the road — all details 
meant to create life-like scenarios 
to challenge autonomous vehicles.

Ford became the first motor 

company to test an autonomous 
vehicle in Mcity in November 
2015, and they used the site again 
to challenge their technology in 
snowy conditions in January 2016.

Jim McBride, Ford technical 

leader for autonomous vehicles, 
said Mcity was an ideal site because 
of its simulated imperfection, 
creating odd scenarios driverless 
cars might experience in the real 
world.

“Mcity allows us the ability 

to create that situation and find 
a safe environment and test it 
repeatedly,” McBride said.

Creating all kinds of life-like 

challenges for driverless cars is 
exactly what Mcity was designed 
for, according to Huei Peng, 
director of MTC.

MTC and Mcity were created in 

an effort to expand development of 
automation and connected vehicles 
both at the University and in the 
state. Gradual steps in advancing 
non-driver controlled technology, 
as well as in connecting cars to 
each other and their environment 
like an Internet, are ways in which 
engineers are moving toward fully 
autonomous vehicles.

“Mcity is a test track designed to 

have future connected automated 
vehicle concepts in mind,” Peng 
said. 

Cars on the market today 

already have partially driverless 
vehicle features. Cruise control, 
automatic braking and assisted 
parking 
systems 
are 
features 

in a vehicle that occur without 
direct driver input, referred to as 
“automated.”

SAE International — originally 

founded 
as 
the 
Society 
of 

Automotive 
Engineers 
— 

characterizes 
the 
degree 
of 

automation in on-road vehicles in 
six levels, zero being completely 
driver-controlled and five being 
completely system-controlled. A 

driverless car is a vehicle with a 
system that controls all dynamic 
driving tasks under all roadway 
and environmental conditions.

Many cars on the road are at a 

level one standard for automation, 
and include features such as cruise 
control and automated braking. In 
the next few years, however, Peng 
said there will be an emergence of 
level two and level three features 
— like highway cruise, traffic jam 
assist and automated valet parking 
— in production vehicles.

Engineers 
of 
driverless 

cars 
are 
also 
developing 

wireless 
connection 
channels, 

called 
dedicated 
short-range 

communications, to allow cars to 
communicate with each other on 
the road. Peng explained that when 
personal computers are connected 
to each other, every PC becomes 
more useful; similarly, cars can 
reduce risk and improve efficiency 
if they connect to other vehicles.

“If we continue to broadcast the 

vehicle’s motion to other cars, it 
will make traffic safer, potentially 
more efficient, and (lead to) less 
energy consumption,” Peng said.

Even before Mcity garnered 

international 
attention, 
the 

University had been a pioneer in 
mobility transformation research.

Noting 
research 
on 
tire 

dynamics, engines and vehicle 
safety developed at the University, 
Peng said vehicle design and 
vehicle manufacturing have been 
pillars of strength at the College of 
Engineering for years.

“We have been the top, if not one 

of the top, automotive engineering 
research 
education 
providers 

among other universities in the 
world,” he said. “We will continue 
to do that; there is no reason we 
give up that tradition of strength.”

Michigan as a hotbed for 

mobility transformation

Since 
being 
elected 
to 

Congress in 2014, Sen. Gary 
Peters (D–Michigan) has joined 
the Senate Commerce, Science 
and Transportation Committee 
and 
has 
actively 
promoted 

legislation to allow for more 
funding to implement for vehicle-
to-infrastructure 
technology. 

According 
to 
Peters, 
these 

efforts are to ensure the state of 
Michigan’s influence in the future 
of mobility.

“This technology is incredibly 

important for our safety and it 
represents the future of the auto 
industry,” Peters said. “We have 
to make every effort to make sure 
it continues to be centered in 
Michigan.”

Alongside Peters’ efforts at the 

federal level, MDOT and state 
legislature have been proactive in 
allowing for driverless car testing 
on the roads. In December 2013, 
Gov. Rick Snyder (R) signed into 
law a bill approving the testing of 
driverless cars on Michigan roads, 
joining only a handful of other 
states in approving such legislation.

Matt Smith, program manager 

at MDOT, said because of the auto 
industry’s location within the state, 
the Michigan state legislature has 
allowed for automated vehicle 
research on state roads long before 
driverless cars existed.

“The state of Michigan has 

allowed experimental technology 
on roadways for many, many 
years,” Smith said.

Even within Ann Arbor, local 

government 
has 
pushed 
for 

testing experimental automated 
technology. 
In 
2013, 
Ann 

Arbor City Council approved a 
$622,884 federal grant to install 
telecommunications fiber, sensors 
and 
electronic 
equipment 
in 

public intersections to allow for 
vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-
infrastructure communication in 
driverless cars.

Peters said the reason legislators 

are 
interested 
in 
pursuing 

autonomous technology in the 
state is to keep jobs related to the 
auto industry within Michigan.

Kevin Kerrigan, senior vice 

president 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Economic 
Development 

Corporation, 
noted 
that 
the 

automotive industry continues to 
be the largest industry in Michigan, 
attracting many businesses and 
growing local jobs. Currently, one 
out of every 24 jobs in the state 
comes from the auto industry, 
according to the Mackinac Center 
for Public Policy. Jobs within the 
auto industry increased by 67 
percent after the recession ended, 
compared to 10.6 percent gain in 
all jobs.

“A big percentage of jobs in 

Michigan are directly related to 
the auto industry,” Peters said. 

“If we were to lose some of 

the technological advantage of 
advanced 
computer 
systems 

related to cars, I would be 
concerned we would start losing 
automotive jobs to a different 
region of the country.”

McBride said Ford’s interest 

in 
pursuing 
driverless 
car 

development was in part to 
ensure the company stays relevant 
when the technology advances. 
Kodak and Nokia, he said, are 
examples 
of 
companies 
that 

could not adapt to the changes 
in the telecommunication and 
digital world, which led to their 
breakdowns.

“It’s very relevant right now 

that we maintain ownership of 
the software and ownership of the 
technology if we want to be viable 
in the future of transportation 
industry,” McBride said. “Every 
company wants to be relevant 
in the long term, and that’s not 
different for Ford.”

Michigan has recently taken a 

step further in leading the charge 
for automated and connected 
vehicles 
by 
announcing 
the 

American Center for Mobility 
in January — a joint partnership 
between government, business 
and University leaders to help build 
another driverless car testing site 
— this time, at 335 acres. The new 
site will be placed in Willow Run, 
where B-24 bombers were made 
for troops in a Henry Ford factory 
during World War II.

John Maddox, assistant director 

of MTC and recently named 
president and CEO of ACM, said 
the new testing site was designed 
due to the success and demand of 
Mcity. While Mcity is primarily 
designed 
to 
test 
early 
stage 

research, once vehicles “graduate” 
from the smaller testing site, they 
can use the larger testing site for 
product development.

Maddox 
said 
Michigan’s 

location as the birthplace and 
home to the auto industry is one 
of a kind in the world, and puts the 
state in the center of driverless car 
development.

“There 
is 
a 
significant 

concentration of expertise and 
activity happening in Southeast 
Michigan,” Maddox said. “In fact, I 
would say it’s unique in the world, 
not just in the United States, for 
having such a concentration in a 
local area of so many companies 
and individuals and universities 
working 
on 
this 
automotive 

technology.”

The future of autonomous 

vehicles and robotics

When 
asked 
whether 
the 

emergence 
of 
connected, 

autonomous vehicles will lead to a 
transportation revolution similar 
to when Henry Ford helped bring 
cars to the mass market in 1908, 
Maddox said no — it would be 
bigger.

He equated the growth of 

connected, driverless cars to how 
the Internet helped connect people 
in new ways, and brought about 
new job opportunities. In the same 
way, he said, autonomous vehicles 
have the potential to transform 
mobility to allow for a whole new 
economic sector.

The City That Runs Itself: 
Mcity and the Future of 
Automated Transportation

October 6, 2016 - After over a 

year of planning, The University 
of Michigan launched its five-year 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
strategic plan Thursday morning.

The 
University-wide 
plan 

includes 
49 
individual 
unit 

plans, which are individualized 
for the schools, colleges and 
administrative, 
athletic 
or 

other departments within the 
University.

“The campus-wide plan is a 

set of actions for today,” Schlissel 
said. “We cannot live up to our full 
potential as a University unless 
everyone has an equal opportunity 
to contribute and to benefit.”

Three key themes tie together 

the University-wide initiatives 
to the operational unit plans: 
creating an inclusive and equitable 
campus 
climate, 
developing 

a 
diverse 
community, 
and 

supporting inclusive scholarship 
and teaching. At the plan’s 
introduction Thursday morning 
in the Power Center, Schlissel said 
the University will commit $85 
million over the next five years 
to fund DEI efforts, in addition 
to the current annual fund of $40 
million a year.

Nearly 700 audience members 

attended the introduction, though 
student attendance was noticeably 
low in comparison to the full 
student body, a common factor 
in 
many 
University-sponsored 

diversity events.

Rob 
Sellers, 
current 
vice 

provost of equity, inclusion and 
academic affairs — who may serve 
as 
the 
University’s 
inaugural 

chief diversity officer pending 
Board of Regents approval later 
this month — presented a short 
executive summary of the plan. 
Unit-level actions specified include 
recruitment efforts like Wolverine 
Pathways — a program giving local 
high schoolers of underrepresented 
minorities the chance to earn a 
tuition scholarships — and new 
investments in urban schools and 
underrepresented 
populations 

such as first-generation and Native 
American students.

Additionally, students, faculty 

and staff will all undergo some 
form of intercultural training, 
with special emphasis on DEI 
professional development for the 
University’s deans and executive 
leadership team.

Sellers said the plan’s success 

rests on commitment from all 
levesls of campus community.

“I accept this position, but in 

no way does this fall on me alone,” 
he said, pointing in particular to 
his recommendation of creating a 
chief diversity officer. “It takes a 
village to raise a plan.”

Many of the morning session’s 

speakers, 
including 
Schlissel, 

Sellers, Provost Martha Pollack 
and Regent Mike Behm (D), made 
references to a series of racially 
charged incidents on campus 
in the last few weeks, which 
prompted a series of student 
protests.

After anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ 

and anti-Muslim flyers were 
posted 
on 
Central 
Campus, 

multiple student protests and 
statements have criticized the 
administration’s DEI initiative 
as too farsighted and lacking in 
immediate solutions.

Pollack said recent events 

highlight 
the 
urgency 
and 

importance of the DEI strategic 
plan.

“It’s only human to respond 

with anger and sometimes with 
fear, emotions that have been felt 
deeply on this campus,” she said. 
“I share the grief and outrage 
felt by our students, faculty and 
staff. We must cling to the vision 
of what the world must be ... and 
that is what the Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan is all about.”

In response to the fliers, 

Schlissel 
held 
a 
community 

conversation Sunday afternoon 
and 
also 
debuted 
several 

administrative 
changes 
at 
a 

leadership breakfast Wednesday 
morning 
tied 
to 
the 
plan, 

including two student advisory 
groups on race and the creation 
of the chief diversity officer.

“In recent weeks, ugly and vile 

hatred have singled out groups 
in our community and sought 
to divide us,” Schlissel said 
Thursday. “We have to learn from 
our failures and mistakes ... our 
Michigan is better for it.”

Behm also acknowledged the 

importance of student activism in 
motivating some of these changes, 
and 
affirmed 
the 
Regents’ 

commitment to the plan’s success.

“We want U of M to be a place 

where there is no doubt everyone 
in our community belongs,” he 
said. “Honest conversations about 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
are difficult.”

“We are provided with so many

us. 
Approach 
our 
teachings 

like a curious scientist and look 
for the facts that underlie our 
interpretations and opinions; the 
data that leads to our conclusions,” 
he said.

Schlissel 
graduated 
from 

Princeton University in 1979 with 
a specialty in biochemical sciences. 
He earned his M.D. and Ph.D. at the 
Johns Hopkins University School 
of Medicine in 1986, subsequently 
completing his residency at Johns 
Hopkins Hospital.

During his academic career, 

Schlissel’s research has centered on 
development biology, specifically 
studying the genetic factors that can 
lead to leukemia and lymphoma.

Schlissel attended the special 

meeting of the Board of Regents 
with his wife Monica Schwebs, who 
also received accolades from the 
regents. She is an environmental 
and energy lawyer at a large 
national firm. The couple has four 
adult children.

In 
a 
press 
release, 
Brown 

University 
President 
Christina 

Paxson praised Schlissel’s work in 
his position as provost.

“Mark is an exceptional scholar, 

teacher 
and 
academic 
leader,” 

Paxson wrote. “He has been an 
esteemed and valued colleague to 
many here at Brown. His many 
contributions will be realized for 
decades to come.”

Paxson 
said 
Schlissel 
led 

several searches for administrative 
positions 
for 
Brown’s 
faculty, 

including the search for its vice 
president of research and its dean 
of medicine and biological sciences.

The 
University 
has 
several 

dean 
searches 
underway 
as 

Schlissel 
makes 
his 
transition 

into the presidency, including the 
appointment of the LSA dean and 
the vice president for research, 
currently held by Susan Gelman and 

Jack Hu, respectively, in interim 
positions.

At 
Brown, 
Schlissel 
helped 

lead a new strategic initiative 
titled “Building on Distinction: A 
New Plan for Brown.” The plan 
established goals for investment in 
academic programs, scholarships 
and campus expansion.

The four goals of the campaign 

include integrative scholarship, 
educational 
leadership, 

academic excellence and campus 
development. 
The 
plans 
are 

designed to be implemented over 
the course of the next 10 years.

While a dean at UC-Berkeley, 

Schlissel also spearheaded a cross-
campus cost containment and 
procurement initiative — efforts 
which have also been underway 
at the University for the past few 
years.

In an article by the Daily 

Herald, 
Schlissel 
detailed 

changes in Brown’s curriculum 
development. One of the projects 
Schlissel 
championed 
includes 

the implementation of a theme for 

the school’s International Studies 
program.

However, Brown’s faculty raised 

several concerns about the strategic 
plan. Paxson and Schlissel created 
forums to address their questions, 
including questions of heightening 
student enrollment to alleviate 
increasing tuition costs.

“We are a very tuition-dependent 

university,” Schlissel said. “The 
idea is to strike the right balance, 
to hit the sweet spot without giving 
up the kind of highly interactive 
mode of education that makes the 
undergraduate program so special 
to allow us to get to the scale where 
we can capture efficiencies.”

In a short speech after his 

appointment, Schlissel expressed 
excitement 
about 
joining 
the 

University community.

“I am amazingly honored to 

be chosen to lead a jewel of the 
American educational system,” he 
said. “The University of Michigan 
is held in such regard. Words almost 
escape me.”

November 16, 2016 - Nearly 

a thousand people gathered on 
the Diag and marched through 
University of Michigan buildings 
for a student walk-out protest 
against racism on campus following 
President-elect Donald Trump’s 
upset win Wednesday afternoon, 
briefly shutting down traffic. 

The 
walkout, 
which 
was 

organized 
by 
the 
student 

organization 
Students4Justice, 

was also attended by civil rights 
activist Rev. Jesse Jackson and 
was part of a national movement of 
walkouts across the country. 

“This walkout is a national 

movement that is happening in 
response to the election, as well 
as the increase in hate crimes and 
other forms of violence against 
marginalized (folks).” the event 
description says. “We are doing 
this to hold President Schlissel 
and our Regents at the University 
of Michigan accountable for their 
claims of valuing diversity and 
student safety and well-being.”

Prior 
to 
the 
event, 

Students4Justice also released a 
list of demands that they hoped to 
achieve from the protest.

The demands include calls 

for University action to protect 
underrepresented 
minority 

students 
by 
re-channeling 

resources, as well as a call for 
the University to become an 
immigrant 
sanctuary 
site, 
to 

double its commitment to rejecting 
racial harassment, to divest from 
unethical corporations and to 
remove all symbols and fliers 
associated 
with 
the 
alt-right 

movement and those encouraging 
white supremacy.

LSA junior Lakyrra Magee, one 

of the event organizers, highlighted 
the call to make the University a 
sanctuary campus — a designation 

that would empower the University 
to limit institutional cooperation 
with federal immigration officers 
seeking undocumented students— 
as among the most significant 
demands.

“Our main message was this: 

Because 
President 
Schlissel 

came out and said he cared about 
diversity 
and 
marginalized 

students, we are here to show so 
many students at the University, 
people who are living in Ann Arbor, 
support the University of Michigan 
becoming a sanctuary campus,” 
she said. “And if President Schlissel 
really cared about (protecting) 
marginalized students, this is one 
concrete way he can do it besides 
showing up.”

Protesters also cited a number 

of recent campus concerns during 
the walkout, including the two hate 
crimes in downtown Ann Arbor 
that have been reported to police 
since Trump’s presidential win 
last week. On Friday, a woman was 
threatened and forced to remove 
her hijab. On Saturday, a woman 
was pushed down a hill and verbally 
harassed. 
Additionally, 
many 

speakers discussed anti-Black, anti-
LGBTQ and anti-Muslim posters, 
many of them promoting themes 
of white supremacy, that have been 
found posted on campus several 
times in the past few months.

LSA junior Alyiah Al-Bonijim 

spoke to the crowd about her 
frustrations with Islamophobic 
comments triggered by her choice 
to wear a hijab.

“For what? Because you want 

to see my hair? Is that what is 
important to these fucking white 
people?” Al-Bonijim asked the 
cheering crowd, saying that forcing 
a woman to take off her clothing, 
including the hijab, was sexual 
assault.

Protesters also touched on 

the failure of a Central Student 
Government resolution Tuesday 
night to divest from corporations 
that have allegedly committed 

human rights violations against 
Palestinians. Many in the crowd 
yelled negative chants about CSG 
during the walkout. 

Following their initial assembly 

on the Diag at 3 p.m., with many 
students walking directly out of 
classes, the protesters marched 
throughout Central Campus, also 
entering buildings and encouraging 
others to join them. 

As the march moved through 

campus, student organizers, as 
well as Jackson, led the crowd in 
a number of chants condemning 
racism, sexism, islamophobia and 
xenophobia.

Chants included slogans such 

as: “No justice, no peace,” “Hey 
Hey, Ho Ho, these racist folks have 
got to go,” “No Alt-Right, no KKK, 
no fascist USA” and “Black Lives 
Matter.”

“Thanks for stepping up and 

fighting back,” Jackson told the 
crowd. “Do not let any election 
oppress your dreams … Red, 
yellow, black and white, you are all 
precious in God’s sight. We must 
learn to live together. This land is a 
land of multiculturalism.”

Chanting 
with 
the 
crowd, 

he 
expressed 
solidarity 
with 

individuals 
who 
have 
felt 

marginalized in the past months, 
including 
Black, 
Muslim 
and 

Mexican-American students.

“We are all sanctuary,” he said. 

“We love each other. We care for 
each other. You take one of us, you 
must take all of us. We are not going 
anywhere. This land is our land. 
We will outlast the meanness, we 
will outlast hate. We will outlast 
violence. Love will conquer hate.”

After walking through several 

buildings, a brief moment of silence 
was held at Burton Memorial 
Tower, during which students told 
stories about their own personal 
struggles. At the end of the walkout, 
organizers 
asked 
for 
white 

supporters to block State Street so 
protesters could safely gather at 
Angell Hall for a speakout.

January 24, 2014 - Mark 

Schlissel, 
Brown 
University’s 

provost, will succeed University 
President Mary Sue Coleman as 
the University of Michigan’s 14th 
president. His term will begin July 1.

The decision was unanimously 

approved 
by 
the 
University’s 

Board of Regents at a special 
meeting Friday morning in the 
Michigan Union’s Kuenzel Room. 
The announcement arrives after 
a presidential search committee 
spent much of the summer and 
fall gathering input from faculty 
and students and the assistance of 
Russell Reynolds Associates, an 
executive search advisory firm.

Schlissel will receive a base 

salary of $750,000 per year with an 
annual increase determined by the 
regents. His contract runs for five 
years. Coleman currently receives 
$603,000 per year in her role, but 
has denied an increase several years 
in a row.

Schlissel began his term as 

provost at Brown in 2011 after 

serving as the University of 

California-Berkeley’s 
dean 
of 

biological sciences from 2008 to 
2011. As provost, Schlissel serves 
as Brown’s chief academic officer 
and deputy to the president. In his 
current role, Schlissel manages 
the day-to-day operations of the 
institution and oversees Brown’s 
strategic planning.

In a press conference after the 

regents approved the appointment, 
Schlissel addressed the challenges 
he expects to face as the next 
president, 
including 
enhancing 

diversity on campus, increasing 
affordability 
and 
developing 

relationships with potential donors 
to the University.

Schlissel 
said 
his 
biggest 

challenge will be engaging with 
students, faculty and staff on 
campus, adding that he has a lot to 
learn since he has never worked at 
the University.

“In my experience, universities 

really don’t get led top-down,” he 
said. “The best ideas come from the 
people who do the teaching and the 
learning, so that’s why I need to do 
some listening first.”

While Schlissel will face many 

issues in his transition, one of the 
most prominent matters he will 
address is the demand for larger 
minority enrollment and inclusion 
at the University.

“You can’t achieve excellence 

as an academic institution without 
being diverse because we live in a 
world where people can look at the 
same set of facts and interpret them 
differently from each other,” he said.

In 
addition 
to 
diversity, 

Schlissel appealed to a wide scope 
of the constituencies, citing the 
University’s 
alumni 
and 
staff 

members as well as the Ann Arbor 
community, in addition to the 
expected listing of faculty, students 
and regents.

He also noted the University’s 

stature as a public institution — 
despite the challenges of declining 
state funding — as a key draw to the 
University.

“Another thing that made me 

say Michigan is a place I really have 
to look at is my feeling about the 
role education can play in solving 
society’s problems,” Schlissel said. 
“And it’s not that we don’t do this 
at great private university — we 
do — but there’s something about 
the openness and the accessibility 
of a public universities that’s 
really special and it drew at my 
heartstrings.”

Coleman 
lauded 
Schlissel’s 

experience and qualifications as the 
next president of the University.

“I’ve often said the job of being 

president at the University of 
Michigan is the best job in the 
country,” she said. “I couldn’t be 
more pleased to know that you, as 
the 14th president, will experience 
this firsthand.”

Before 
approving 
Schlissel’s 

appointment as president, each 
regent lauded his qualifications for 
the position.

“This is a great day for the 

University of Michigan. We go today 
from strength to strength; from one 
great leader, Mary Sue Coleman, 
to another, Mark Schlissel,” said 
University Regent Mark Bernstein 
(D–Ann Arbor).

Bernstein 
recalled 
Schlissel’s 

answer to one of the central 
questions that faced the search 
committee: What makes a great 
university president?

“You have to love and be amazed 

by students. You have to love and 

be amazed by faculty. You have to 
love and be amazed by research and 
discovery.”

In an interview after the press 

conference, 
University 
Provost 

Martha Pollack, who will perhaps 
work most closely with the new 
president, 
praised 
Schlissel’s 

academic record, as well as his 
interest in faculty and research 
and commitment to diversity and 
affordability.

“You heard the regents talk 

about him having great ethics, 
great values and a great heart — 
that’s just the combination you 
want,” Pollack said.

She added that she will have 

a one-on-one meeting with the 
president-elect Friday afternoon as 
she begins to share knowledge and 
understand how to best work with 
him.

Though 
this 
was 
her 
first 

introduction to the University’s 14th 
president, E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for student life, said she 
saw Schlissel as someone who could 
build on Coleman’s strengths.

“Regent Bernstein said it just 

right — we’re going from strength 
to strength,” Harper said. “I love the 
fact that he is so student-centered, 
because our students are used to 
that and deserve that.”

Schlissel will also direct the 

remainder 
of 
the 
University’s 

Victors for Michigan development 
campaign, which aims to raise $4 
billion in funds.

Jerry May, vice president for 

development, 
said 
he 
thinks 

Schlissel 
will 
easily 
form 

relationships with donors as he 
prepares to raise about half of the 
campaign goal. May also called 
attention to Schlissel’s apparent 
willingness to listen and ability to 
form a vision for the University.

“He is articulate, he is real, he 

is genuine, he has an incredible 
pedigree,” 
May 
said. 
“I 
was 

astounded that he could answer 
things as if he’s been on this campus 
for months. The alumni and donors 
are going to love him. The instinct 
that I’ve seen today is that this is a 
no-brainer. This guy is going to do 
great.”

When Schlissel arrived at Brown 

in 2011, he gave a convocation 
address which called on students to 
channel synergies across disciplines, 
a theme that he echoed in his first 
address as president-elect.

The 
University 
of 

Michigan Board of Regents 
voted unanimously to give 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel another pay raise 
for the third year in a row 
Thursday afternoon.

Retroactively 
effective 

Sept. 1, Schlissel’s salary will 
rise by 3.5 percent, resulting 
in an increase from $795,675 
to $823,523.

At the beginning of the 

meeting, 
Regent 
Andrew 

Richner, 
R-Grosse 
Pointe, 

applauded Schlissel, who is 
entering his fourth year of 
leadership this year. Richner 

offered a positive performance 
review of Schlissel, praising 
the 
president’s 
focus 
on 

academic 
excellence, 

student affordability and the 
University’s record applicant 
number. 

“We think you’re doing a 

great job,” Richner said.

The 
five-year 
contract 

Schlissel 
signed 
in 
2014 

allows for the regents to 
increase his salary as they 
see fit. In 2015 and 2016, he 
received identical pay raises 
of 3 percent.

Schlissel’s salary remains 

significantly 
higher 
than 

that of the average public 
university 
leader 
which, 

according to the Chronicle 

The University of Michigan 

Library’s Joseph A. Labadie 
Collection hosted a panel 
Thursday night at the Harlan 
Hatcher Graduate Library to 
honor the late Tom Hayden, 
a social and political activist 
of the 1960s, as well as a 
former 
Michigan 
Daily 

editor-in-chief. 
The 
panel 

consisted of three University 
affiliates who have all done 
research on topics relating 
to Hayden’s anti-war, civil 
rights and radical intellectual 
counterculture activism.

Labadie Collection Curator 

Julie Herrada said the panel 
was held to pay homage to 
Hayden and his work in 
a manner he would have 
appreciated.

“We decided on a panel 

rather than hosting a reunion 
of 
radicals, 
even 
though 

we’re really good at hosting 
reunions 
... 
because 
Tom 

would’ve loved this event,” 
Herrada said. “Every time 
Tom came to campus he 
insisted on engaging with 
students and it was important 
for him to do that. I wanted to 
give the students that worked 
on topics that related to the 
work that he did a chance 
to showcase their work and 
talk about him and also their 
work.”

Hayden was a key Civil 

Rights activist during the ‘60s 

and ‘70s, during which he was 
badly beated and arrested. 
Despite 
opposing 
violent 

protests, Hayden supported 
militant 
demonstrations. 

One of his most notable 
achievements 
includes 

working 
for 
the 
Newark 

Community Union Project, 
which founded the Indochina 
Peace Campaign and working 
on the Vietnam War protest 
documentary, 
“Introduction 

to the Enemy.” 

Hayden 
was 
also 

instrumental during the Civil 
Rights movement in the ‘60s 
and ‘70s. During a protest 
in Mississippi, he was badly 
beaten and arrested. In a 
Georgia jail, he began writing 
the Port Huron Statement, the 
manifesto of the SDS, which 
called upon college students 
to peacefully oppose racism 
and oppressive government.

In 2014, Hayden donated 

a collection of his papers to 
the Labadie Collection to be 
more accessible to students, 
scholars and researchers. The 
collection is archived in the 
Special Collections Library, 
and documents the history 
of social protest movements 
and 
marginalized 
political 

communities from the 19th 
century to the present.

Roasting Plant, a trendy new 

coffee shop that originated in 
New York City’s Upper East Side, 
has just opened its first location 
in Ann Arbor. The new store, 
located at 312 S. State St., opened 
its doors for the first time on 
Sunday and has been bustling 
ever since.

The coffee shop puts a spin on 

the average coffee shop on the 
University of Michigan’s campus 
by emphasizing the actual coffee 
beans. Customers choose the 
specific bean they want, then 
can look up and watch the beans 
move through a glass tube on 
the ceiling before landing in the 
coffeemaker behind the counter.

Mo Zeitoun, store manager 

at Roasting Plant’s Ann Arbor 
location, said this device is called 
the “Javabot” and was created 
by Mike Caswell, the founder 
of 
Roasting 
Plant. 
Caswell, 

engineer and former Starbucks 
employee, created Roasting Plant 
to devise a way to get the freshest 
coffee possible. Roasting Plant 
gets their coffee from farmers all 
around the world.

Adjusting to college life can be 

difficult, but adjusting to college 
life in a new country, surrounded 
by new people, new customs 
and new traditions can be even 
harder. For Business sophomore 
Shreyas Poddar, the transition as 
a freshman international student 
coming to the University of 
Michigan was far from easy.

“I (was) disliking my time here, 

I (had) no friends, just nothing, 
nothing is going my way,” he 
said. “You need certain social 
connections to get into clubs, 
you need to know certain things 
to just talk, you need to know 
certain cultural references to just 
talk and I just knew nobody here. 
I just wish that I had a mentor.”

This mentorship idea of got 

him thinking about how he could 
learn from his own experiences to 
help other international students 
transition more easily into life 
at the University. As a LSA 
representative within CSG, he 
had the opportunity to propose 
initiatives to affect the student 
body in a positive way. Motivated

The Trump and Walmart 

Make America Worse college 
tour, organized by “Making 
Change at Walmart,” made 
a stop at the Diag Thursday 
afternoon 
to 
meet 
with 

students and host speakers on 
the alleged ties between the 
Trump administration and the 
Walmart corporation. About 
30 students and community 
members wandered in and out 
of the event.

The event was supported 

and led by Progressives at 
the University of Michigan, 
the 
Lecturers 
Employee 

Union, 
the 
Huron 
Valley 

Democratic 
Socialists 
of 

America 
and 
Michelle 

Deatrick, a Washtenaw County 
Commissioner who is running 

for Michigan State Senate.

Amy 
Ritter, 
the 

communications director for 
“Making Change at Walmart,” 
a campaign run the United 
Food and Commercial Workers 
International, said the tour 
is meant to highlight the 
similarities and connections 
between President Trump, his 
cabinet and the international 
corporation 
Walmart. 
She 

specifically 
mentioned 

the 
relationship 
between 

Education 
Secretary 
Betsy 

DeVos 
and 
the 
Walton 

foundation 
in 
regards 
to 

charter schools.

“We’re 
hitting 
over 
25 

campuses 
throughout 
the 

month of September to expose 
the shared values of Trump and 
Walmart and how those values 
destroy 
public 
education, 

divide our country, promote a 
low-wage debt economy and do 

not align with student values 
as they should,” Ritter said.

Phil Bianco, a member of 

Huron 
Valley 
Democratic 

Socialists 
of 
America, 

spoke at the rally and said 
the 
consistencies 
between 

Republican 
and 
Walmart’s 

policies are too similar to 
ignore.

“There is no doubt that the 

Trump regime and Republican 
rule 
has 
cost many 
their 

lives

“The rule of capital and the

class, 
of 
which 

Walmart is a key player, have

Rackham

Akash 

Shah met with organizers after 
the rally and said the points 
“Making Change at Walmart” 

made were important for 
college students specifically 
because of their place at an 
academic institution.

“I think it’s an incredible 

thing that a lot of students 
are trying to voice their 
opinions and trying to get 
others to understand where 
they’re 
coming 
from,” 

Shah said. “With (Making 
Change 
at 
Walmart’s) 

movement 
specifically, 
I 

think it pertains to all of us 
in the sense that a proper 
education 
can 
drastically 

alter the future of a country 
… and I think that our 
current 
administration 
is 

kind of lacking in expertise 
in terms of their ability to 
cater towards kids who want 
to get an education.”

Every Friday, the Michigan Daily will be 
republishing an article from the Daily’s archives 
from a moment in University history. 

During the past decade, Ann Arbor 

has gained statewide notoriety each 
spring by being the home of the annual 
“Hash Bash,” an event which attracts 
dope-smokers en-masse to the Diag to 
celebrate the activity amid the sheltered 
security of Ann Arbor’s lenient pot law. 

The Hash Bash began a decade ago, 

when political activism was near its 
peak, but the political tone of the event 
has declined steadily ever since. Once a 
proudly cherished chance for University 
students to gather to make a symbolic 
“statement” to the multitude of media 
attracted to the event, the Hash Bash 
has lost its original appeal to University 
students in recent years, and has instead 
hosted youths primarily from outside 
Ann Arbor. In fact, the Hash Bash has 
become the object of scorn among many 
students, and in Daily editorials. Without 
its assets as a meaningful political event, 
to most students the Hash Bash has 
become simply an unwelcome reason 

to reroute walks to classes, and a source 
of garbage and vandalism that mars 
the campus for weeks to come. Overall, 
students have, on the whole, done their 
best to ignore the event, which still drew 
over 1,000 last April. 

“I was surprised when I woke up this 

morning and there were a whole lot of 
people on the Diag,” said one LSA junior, 
illustrating the indifferent student 
attitude that has taken hold concerning 
the Hash Bash. “Not too many people 
know what’s going on,” he added. 
Another student expressed his fondness 
of the activity which the Hash Bash 
bemoans, but planned to celebrate it in 
his own way. “If it’s nice, I may celebrate 
the Hash Bash on the Diag,” he said on 
the Bash’s eve, “but if its crummy out, I’ll 
celebrate it at home with a few friends.”

Indeed, as has been the case in the 

past several years, the weather for the 
Hash Bash has been miserable — which 
has further inspired students to spend 
the day with books, and to reserve the 
Hash Bashing for sunnier days.

international students as he could 
to have a friend — a liaison of 
sorts — Poddar teamed up with 
LSA juniors Ali Rosenblatt, Seth 
Schostak and Ayah Issa, also 
representatives within CSG, to 
begin planning the program.

“CSG is a really big organization, 

but when people from different 
branches manage to collaborate, 
that’s sort of how it happens,” 
Issa said. “We were introduced by 
another person in CSG.”

Dubbed M-Pals, students can 

apply to be a student guide for new 
international students. As part of 
their training, about 25 students 
attended 
monthly 
workshops 

at the International Center to 
prepare them for their roles.

M-Pals 
sent 
applications 

to 
accepted 
international 

students until June, when the 
matchmaking began. Each of the 
current students were paired 
with two or three international 
students, and the pairs exchanged 
emails over the summer and 
through the beginning of the 
school year. On Thursday evening, 
M-Pals hosted their first event of 
the school year, where everyone 
involved in the program met face-
to-face, rather than just through 
email correspondence.

For 
Rosenblatt, 
the 
most 

important part of the program 
involved 
familiarizing 

international students with the 

“We get the beans green, and 

we roast them as we need them,” 
Zeitoun said. “So let’s say today, 
you decide to have a Guatemala. 
You know that your Guatemalan 
beans have been roasted within 
a few days. You don’t want 
anything that’s roasted within 
an hour or two, because it’s too 
fresh to drink. So we actually 
want it to sit for at least 12 hours, 
so everything in the Javabot 
has had at least a day of being 
roasted.”

Roasting Plant also serves 

freshly 
made 
iced 
drinks. 

Rather than keeping chilled 
coffee in a fridge or putting it 
over ice, Roasting Plant uses a 
“Chiller,” another device created 
by Caswell. The Chiller, like 
the Javabot, is on display for 
customers. It’s a large glass bowl 
with tubes inside that are sitting 
in cold water. The coffee is run 
through the tubes and is chilled 
in the process.

The State Street store is 

Roasting Plant’s first location in 
Ann Arbor, and Zeitoun said this 
has been a goal for some time.

“Ann Arbor has just been one 

of those locations that we’ve 
always really wanted to get in, 
and we just found this prime 
location across the street from 
the University, so it was perfect,” 

Zeitoun said.

Since the soft opening on 

Sunday, the new location has 

been 
unexpectedly 
busy 
— 

Zeitoun said they haven’t even 
had time to train their new 
employees.

“We’ve only been open for four 

days, and it’s insane,” Zeitoun 
said. “Everyone’s talking about it, 
and we’re already getting repeat 
customers coming in every day 
and It’s only going to get better 
and better.”

Zeitoun said this is because 

Roasting Plant is a completely 
different experience from nearby 
coffee shops like Starbucks and 
Espresso Royale.

“It’s totally different coffee,” 

Zeitoun said. “Totally different 
concept. And even though we 
beat all the coffeeshops in quality, 
we’re still very competitive in 

pricing.”

LSA 
senior 
Kyle 
Bailey 

appreciated 
the 
unique 

experience, and said he’d never 
heard of the Roasting Plant chain 
before.

“I like how the atmosphere 

mixes modern elements with 
more old-fashioned ones, like 
the exposed brick walls,” Bailey 
said.

The care with which the 

coffee is handled was also not 
lost on students. Art & Design 
sophomore Alyssa Lopatin took 
particular notice of this.

“I’ve been to a lot of coffee 

places 
all 
over 
the 
place,” 

Lopatin said. “And wherever I 
go, the best ones are always the 
ones that just care more.”

Ann Arbor Police Department 

officers arrested a California man 
this week after connecting him 
to an extensive identity theft and 
counterfeit operation that spanned 
across several states.

30-year-old 
Shawn 
Ingram 

was apprehended after a gas 
station clerk reported his use of 
a counterfeit $20 bill, Channel 4 
News reported. Police officers 
had been previously alerted that 
numerous counterfeit bills had 
been circulating in Ann Arbor. 
The clerk noted Ingram’s license 
plate number and police tracked it 
to a car rental agency. The AAPD 
then traced Ingram to a hotel 
parking lot and arrested him as 
he was exiting an elevator in the 
hotel.

The 
detectives 
discovered 

several dozen counterfeit debit 
cards, credit cards, iTunes and 
other gift cards, numerous sheets 
of counterfeit currency, multiple 
fake driver’s licenses and devices 
capable of producing these items. 
They believe the suspect has been 
operating out of a mobile lab in 
order to maintain discretion and 
operate behind the scenes.

“We believe that this operation 

has crossed into several states,” 
AAPD said in a statement. “The 
suspect 
has 
used 
numerous 

rented cars and hotel rooms 
in what we believe is to keep 
the criminal enterprise mobile 
thereby increasing the likelihood 
of success.”

Ingram is currently being held 

in Washtenaw County Jail and is 
charged with nine felony counts.

of Higher Education, averaged 
$464,000 last calendar year.

Nevertheless, 
he 
remains 

outside of the top ten paid 
public university officials due 
to an increase in the average 
public 
university 
official’s 

salary between 2016 and 2017.

After five years of compiling 

data, 
the 
Chronicle 
noted 

average 
salary 
generally 

increases 
2 
to 
3 
percent 

annually. 
Yet, 
this 
year, 

the 
average 
increase 
was 

approximately 
5 
percent 

— 
noticeably 
higher 
than 

Schlissel’s 3.5 percent raise.

Last fiscal year, the three 

highest paid public university 
leaders 
each 
took 
home 

$1,000,000 
or 
more, 
while 

seven earned over $700,000. 

Raymond Watts, president 

of the University of Alabama 
at 
Birmingham, 
received 

$890,000 last year — the 10th 
highest 
public 
university 

official salary in the country — 
while President Michael Crow 
of Arizona State topped the list 
with more than $1.5 million. 

However, the Chronicle does 

not account for the housing 
and transportation Schlissel 
receives from the University, 
benefits other presidents do not 
necessarily gain.

Schlissel 
also 
thanked 

May for his work with the 
campaign and effectiveness in 
fundraising in general, saying 
the University’s supporters 
and competitors often passed 
along praise of May to him.

“You really do make blue 

go,” Schlissel said.

Construction 
and 

Renovation

Several 
of 
the 
regents 

debated 
raising 
the 
cost 

threshold 
for 
construction 

and renovation projects not 
requiring 
regent 
approval 

from 
$1 
million 
to 
$3 

million. Kevin Hegarty, the 
University’s 
executive 
vice 

president and chief financial 
officer, proposed the measure, 
which ultimately passed 5-3, 
saying $3 million was still a 
relatively low threshold. 

“Projects that fall in the $1 

million to $3 million dollar 
cost range are typically of a 
routine, capital maintenance 
nature,” he said. “Things like 
replacing 
air 
conditioners, 

replacing heaters, replacing 
damaged or failed drain lines, 
doing building repairs, street 
repairs, etc.”

Several 
regents 
opposed 

the 
measure, 
however. 

Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs 
(D) said she felt a fiduciary 

responsibility to students to 
require stricter procedures 
for approval, citing rising 
tuition costs.

“I’m not in favor of this 

proposal because I think the 
$3 million limit is too high,” 
she said. “This is not about 
trust –– I trust the executive 
officers –– this is about how I 
feel about oversight of public 
dollars, 
particularly 
when 

the limit is reaching the same 
amount of money that I hope 
for for tuition increase.”

Regent Ron Weiser (R) was 

one of the regents in favor 
of 
raising 
the 
threshold, 

saying the ability to expedite 
the approval process could 
ultimately 
end 
up 
saving 

the 
University 
money 
on 

construction contracts.

“Having some knowledge 

of construction, because of 
the shortage of labor and 
contractors, 
the 
cost 
of 

projects can go up if they 
can’t fit them in a certain time 
period,” he said. “So for these 
kinds of projects, quite often, 
if we can’t move quickly, the 
price is going to be quoted 
at a higher rate, because by 
the time we get back to them 
they might not have the time 
periods available to make 
them.”

Schembechler Hall
The regents also approved 

schematic designs for 24,000 
square feet of renovations 

to the Schembechler Hall 
football performance center, 
which will include a state-of-
the-art treatment and recovery 
facility, hydrotherapy pools 
and administrative spaces.

Plans for renovations to 

the Oosterbaan Field House, 
which 
include 
replacing 

lighting, practice surfaces and 
the roof of the facility, were 
approved in February.

Citing the large size of the 

football team, the goal of the 
renovations is to provide a 
more unified space where 
all 
athletes 
can 
practice 

simultaneously.

Schlissel, Sarkar welcome 

students back to school

President 
Schlissel 

welcomed the regents back 
for the first meeting of the 
academic year and expressed 
his concern for all those 
on 
campus 
affected 
by 

Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.

“I want to express my 

sympathies 
for 
those 
in 

the 
University 
community 

affected by recent natural 
disasters,” he said. “All of the 
students from Texas are safe 
and sound here on campus.”

Schlissel then announced 

the formation of a search 
committee 
for 
the 
next 

University 
of 
Michigan-

Dearborn chancellor, which 
will begin with two Dearborn 
campus town halls Sept. 29 and 
Oct. 2. The committee consists 

of wide range of faculty and 
professors, stemming from all 
three University campuses.

As 
with 
all 
executive 

officer selection processes, 
the procedure will remain 
confidential 
until 
Schlissel 

provides his recommendation 
to the Board of Regents.

The regents also received 

their first report from LSA 
senior 
Anushka 
Sarkar, 

president of Central Student 
Government.

While Schlissel did not 

address the recent defacing of 

the Rock, which was covered 
with anti-Latino and pro-
Trump graffiti, Sarkar noted 
the importance of calling out 
forces that threaten the well-
being of University students, 
no matter how controversial 
they may be.

“I want to emphasize the 

importance of speaking out in 
the face of happenings simply 
beyond the campus that impact 
our 
Michigan 
community,” 

she said. “When forces beyond 
the confines of the University 
of Michigan campus threaten 
any member of the University 
of Michigan’s community, it is 
our collective responsibility 
–– every person at this table 
–– to support, protect and 
stand 
in 
solidarity 
with 

the students who are being 
impacted. I will also note that 
supporting, 
protecting 
and 

standing in solidarity with 
members of our Michigan 
community who are being 
threatened by these forces 
sometimes means pushing the 
envelope and being outspoken 
in your support.”

Sarkar 
also 
mentioned 

several 
CSG 
initiatives 

for 
the 
upcoming 
year, 

including 
“Know 
Your 

Rights” workshops following 
the recent DACA decision, 
alcohol-free tailgates on high-
risk game days and increasing 
first year student involvement 
in student government.

know how to support their 
institution.

“This kind of (rally) gets 

(students) involved in some of 
the most crucial issues,” Eaton 
said. “As the speakers said, 
Walmart and their owners have 
been funding the defunding 
of public education. This is 
a public university. I know 
students who are going to the 
University of Michigan are 
incurring huge debt because we 
don’t fund public education the 
way we used to.”

With 
Michigan 
State 

University as the next stop 
on their tour, Ritter said the 
college tour was organized to 
show college students their 
effect on the global economy 
and their impact on politics 
through the places they shop.

“It’s hard to change the 

world, but you can change your 
world and every day, students 
here on this campus have the 
opportunity 
to 
change 
the 

world in the small decisions 
that they make and where they 
put their purchasing power, 
their economic power, their 
political power through their 
vote — they’re able to make that 
change and we want people 
to be aware of that. You don’t 
have to be a CEO to change the 
country.” 

TRUMP
From Page 1A

Herrada said she felt the 

panel was an excellent way to 
bring 
historical 
movements 

and moments together with 
modern 
day 
activism 
and 

scholarship.

“As 
an 
archivist 
and 

librarian 
it’s 
important 

for me to kind of relate 
the work that people are 
doing here on campus — 
how they came to find that 
work, how they discovered 
the documentation of the 
historical 
movements 
that 

they did find — and a lot of 
them can be found here in the 
library,” Herrada said. “So for 
me a takeaway is how much 
rich scholarship can come 
out of the resources the U-M 
library has. Also how they can 
relate historical movements 
to what is happening today.”

The 
panel 
consisted 
of 

researchers and activists who 
each have done research or 

are experts in topics related 
to Hayden’s work during his 
activism. 

The three topics set the 

scene of what was happening 
during the 1960s and 1970s and 
how that related to Hayden’s 
work.

LSA senior Leah Schneck, 

an organizer on campus for 
College Democrats, discussed 
her research on participatory 
democracy. 
She 
described 

participatory 
democracy, 

a 
term 
coined 
by 
Arnold 

Kaufman, to be a method, 
not a theory, to reevaluate 
hierarchies that exist in our 
society.

“It 
is 
different 
from 
a 

representative system because 
it brings direct responsibility 
and 
accountability 
through 

building a system of how you 
make decisions starting in 
smaller groups and then the 
decision that comes from the 
smaller group then reaches a 
higher level,” Schneck said.

Sian Olson Dowis, University 

alum and doctoral candidate in 
U.S. History at Northwestern 

University, 
presented 
her 

research on the left movement 
in 
Urban 
America. 
Dowis 

spent time on the Economic 
Research and Action Project 
that was founded in 1963 by 
Students for a Democratic 
Society, a student organization 
that Hayden co-founded.

Dowis 
discussed 
how 

history has shown, through 
examples such as the ERAP, 
that creating any kind of social 
change requires more than 
strong ideals; it requires open-
mindedness.

“It shows that democracy 

is messy,” Dowis said. “Social 
change is messy and, that 
there is an enormous amount 
of 
change 
going 
on, 
and 

sometimes to achieve really 
important 
social 
ends 
you 

have to be willing to change 
your mind and listen to people 
saying things even if they’re 
not really what you want or 
hoping to hear, but that’s what 

democracy is. It’s listening to 
people and taking their ideas 
seriously.”

Taubman 
postdoctoral 

fellow Austin McCoy spoke 
about his research on Tom 
Hayden 
and 
the 
“Final 

Campaign to End the War.” 
He discussed the importance 
of following political thought 
through time.

“I think what seems to be 

important was that it shows 
how some of his thinking 
around politics, participatory 
democracy 
especially 
can 

still resonate today,” McCoy 
said. “As an audience member 
pointed out, we are galloping 
towards oligarchy. I think folks 
want to know what happened 
to American Democracy, and 
are there any other visions 
that could counter the kind 
of representative democracy 
we have now and I think 
Tom Hayden points us in that 
direction.”

campus. While promotional 
videos and other forms of 
information exist to help new 
students become acquainted 
with the University, advice 
directly from students is often 
more helpful.

“There’s a lot of questions 

that I think come up before 
you get to Michigan,” she said. 
“We try to bridge that gap, that 
knowledge gap, to kind of even 
out the playing field of what 
people know when they come 
to campus.”

With assistance from the 

International 
Center 
and 

the Office of New Student 
Programs, the leaders took 
into account any possible 
barriers.

Another major goal of the 

program is to help connect 
and 
create 
meaningful 

relationships 
between 

students 
from 
different 

backgrounds. 
Schostak 

explained the divide between 
international and domestic 
students is something CSG 
recognizes 
and 
looks 
to 

improve upon.

“I think it’s a really cool 

community of people who are 
trying to make the University 
and campus more inclusive,” 
he said. “We always felt 
there was a big gap between 
international 
students 
and 

domestic students.”

When 
Schostak 
asked 

Public Policy junior Benji 
Mazin to serve as an M-Pal, 
he willingly agreed and was 
paired with Business senior 
Mencía Lasa. One unique 
aspect of their situations is 
that both students are from 
Spain — this being Lasa’s first 
year at the University.

Lasa explained that M-Pals 

made her transition as an 
international student easier 
and that she and Mazin have 
had the opportunity to meet 
each other’s friends, creating 
even more connections on 
campus.

“He’s been really helpful 

with all the experience itself, 
he’s given me tips on buildings 
and what the University is 
like, the campus ... it’s been 
really easy to adapt to the new 

environment,” she said.

M-Pals looks to grow in 

the coming years to support 
more international students by 
expanding their base of current 
Michigan students as well as 
implementing new ideas and 
activities for M-Pals to engage 
in. The opportunity to meet 
new people is something that 
many college students look 
to take advantage of, and for 
the founders of M-Pals, the 
experience has been especially 
meaningful for those who got 
to pair up with international 
students.

Issa said while helping to 

create the program has been 
rewarding, her favorite part 
of it all was taking part in 
its activities, expanding her 
network and meeting new 
people.

“I met a lot of people in the 

workshops, I learned what 
questions really get you to 
know more about a person,” 
she said. “I met more people 
internationally and I managed 
to match with an M-Pal, so 
I got to be a part of my own 


W

hen I voted for 
Hillary 
Clinton 

in 
the 
general 

election, I, like many other 
Americans, 
swallowed 
my 

distaste for her personality 
to do the right thing — avoid 
electing a man whose policies 
threatened the very fabric of 
our democracy and time-tested 
values. Unfortunately, it didn’t 
make enough of a difference to 
sway the election in Clinton’s 
favor and now, Democrats, 
moderates and Republicans 
need time to heal from this 
disaster of an election year 
and mobilize against the new 
administration. But, rather 
than leading this resistance, 
Clinton chose to drag us back 
into the past with her new book 
and its accompanying tour. 

Clinton’s 
book, 
“What 

Happened,” is a new low for 
the politician who just can’t 
figure out that she’s the root of 
her own problems. Excerpts 
from the book reveal that 
she attributes the loss to just 
about everyone but herself. 
She berates Bernie Sanders 
for 
“echoing” 
her 
own 

ideas, writing “No matter 
how bold and progressive 
my policy proposals were 
… Bernie would come out 
with something even bigger, 
loftier and leftier.”

Apparently Clinton doesn’t 

understand that two opposing 
candidates 
should 
have, 

and are expected to have, 
differences in policy. Sanders 
wasn’t stealing her ideas; he 
had radically different, yet 
sensible, approaches to policy. 
Clinton wanted a continuation 
of 
moderate 
Obama-era 

policies, such as subsidized 
insurance and student debt 
relief. 
Sanders 
saw 
this 

solution as putting a bandage 
on a torn artery, the systems 
so flawed they required total 
transformation 
into 
public 

programs. Sanders sought a 
shift toward the European 
model; 
Clinton 
accepted 

gradual reform.

A more egregious example of 

finger pointing in the book was 
her speculation of what would 
have happened had former 
President 
Barack 
Obama 

done a prime-time address on 
Russian interference in the 
election. These kinds of what-
if musings are emblematic 
of post traumatic denial. It 
appears 
her 
post-election 

funk, where she admitted, “I 
couldn’t feel, I couldn’t think. 
I was just gobsmacked, wiped 
out,” has lingered to this day.

Her anger toward former 

FBI Director James Comey 
is 
understandable, 
but 

openly doubting a man who 
gave her one of the most 
powerful positions on Earth 
after defeating her in an 

election is shameless. Obama 
was a steadfast ally during 
the campaign, not an aloof 
observer. 
Even 
Clinton’s 

staffers 
are 
sharing 
a 

“collective groan,” according 
to Politico. Having worked 
tirelessly to defend her image 
from both conspiracy-ridden 
nonsense 
and 
legitimate 

criticism, they were looking 
forward to some time off. 
Even colleagues in Congress, 
such as Senator John McCain, 
R-Ariz., 
dodged 
questions 

about the book tour, not 
wanting to be caught in the 
webs of her mistake. 

It seems Clinton doesn’t 

understand 
the 
beating 

heart of political thought in 
the United States. It’s raw, 
straight to the point and 
embraces strong values over 

intellectual 
debate. 
Most 

Americans 
don’t 
peruse 

through 
political 
science 

dissertations 
or 
subscribe 

to policy magazines — that’s 
obvious and expected. But 
most 
don’t 
even 
engage 

in “soft” civic duties like 
writing their senators or 
brushing up on United States 
history and law.

There is nothing inherently 

wrong with this, but it does 
illustrate a divide between 
the ways Clinton and Trump 
interacted with the public. 
Rejecting 
Clinton’s 
policy 

approach, Trump understood 
that the most effective way 
to win the hearts of people in 
the United States was through 
direct, no nonsense messaging 
and an avoidance of excesses, 
which blundered Clinton. Her 
carefully controlled speeches 
struck many Americans as 
elitist and emblematic of a 
career politician. As Clinton 
admitted 
in 
her 
book’s 

introduction, “In the past 
… I’ve often felt I had to be 
careful in public, like I was up 
on a wire without a net. Now 
I’m letting my guard down.”

While many cringe at her 

change in persona after the 
election, a sizable number of 
people are willing to pay to 
see her. Tickets to some of 
her book signings this year 
have reportedly been as high 
as $2,000. Not too shabby for 
someone who charged $675,000 
for a couple of speeches to 
Goldman Sachs. The real icing 
on the cake, however, is her 
planned tour in Wisconsin, a 
state she notoriously neglected 
to visit during the campaign. 
It’s hard to tell whether Clinton 
realizes 
these 
actions 
rub 

people the wrong way, and 
that’s exactly her issue. She 
doesn’t read the mood of the 
general public well enough to 
understand the cringe-worthy 
similarities of high ticket prices 
and speaking fees.

Americans 
tend 
to 
elect 

presidents 
because 
of 

personality, not policy. If a 
candidate “feels right” with 
voters, they enjoy a massive 
advantage. Al Gore, Walter 
Mondale and George H.W. all 
lacked the personal spark that 
their opponents had, leaving 
many pundits to conclude it 
cost them their elections. Those 
were just blunders that included 
a 
couple 
of 
sighs 
during 

debates, an odd campaign ad 
and frequent watch checks.

For a modern candidate, 

Clinton was disliked on a 
whole new level. To put it 
simply, she isn’t as relatable 
as she thinks she is. She’s 
wonky, 
and 
couldn’t 
act 

like the average gal if her 
life depended on it. Her 
personality 
is 
so 
sour 

that 
Americans 
chose 
an 

inexperienced 
reality 
TV 

star to run the country over 
a politician with the best 
résumé 
in 
the 
business. 

Whether 
her 
reputation 

is the result of sexism or 
legitimate 
grievance 
can 

be debated extensively, but 
doesn’t change the fact more 
Americans believed her to 
be dishonest. While Trump 
also possesses a repellant 
personality, 
the 
American 

public 
concluded 
that 
it 

was more “genuine” than 
Clinton’s. 
Trump 
may 
be 

cruder, twisted and morally 
repugnant, but he clicked 
better 
with 
the 
public’s 

craving for authenticity.

Continuing to ignore the 

public’s 
collective 
groans, 

she 
drudges 
on, 
speaking 

about herself and charging 
hefty fees for you to hear it. 
We won’t help our country 
by more finger pointing, so 
please — for once, stay out of 
the spotlight, Hillary.

I

n my early teens, my ears 
began to ring. Friends and 
family began to sound 

like what I can best describe 
as the voice of Charlie Brown’s 
teacher. At the time, I had 
chalked it up to just not paying 
attention as well as I should 
have. As the years went on 
my hearing got progressively 
worse, and after struggling 
through a basic hearing exam 
at my doctor’s office I knew 
something was wrong. I went 
to an audiologist to have a 
more rigorous hearing exam. 
I was told that my hearing 
was impaired. I was fitted 
with hearing aids and was 
immediately struck with how 
clearly I could hear those 
around me. My quality of life 
improved greatly and I became 
more independent. 

While 
hearing 
aids 

significantly 
improved 

my ability to hear people 
in smaller settings, I still 
struggled to hear a speaker in 
larger rooms. With increased 
background noise and echoing 
causing interference in my 
hearing 
aids, 
the 
Charlie 

Brown teacher voice returned. 
Hearing loops saved me in 
those situations.

A hearing loop describes a 

system in which a wire that 
surrounds an audience, usually 
installed in the ceiling or 
the floor, directly transmits 
electromagnetic sound from 
a sound system that someone 
with 
a 
hearing 
aid 
or 
a 

cochlear implant can pick up 
by switching their device to the 
“T-coil” setting. Rooms with 
a hearing loop installed will 
have a sign that indicates to a 
deaf or hard-of-hearing person 
that a hearing loop is available.

While hearing loops can 

be installed in any size room, 
they 
are 
especially 
useful 

in large spaces like lecture 
halls, where echoing tends 
to be a larger problem. By 
directly transmitting sound 
to someone with a hearing aid 
or a cochlear implant, hearing 
loops 
cut 
the 
unnecessary 

noise 
caused 
by 
echoing, 

providing increasing clarity of 
the speaker to the listener. Not 
all hearing aids and cochlear 
implants are equipped with 
the T-coil setting, but the 
majority are, meaning that this 
is a technology that benefits a 
large percentage of people who 
are hard of hearing.

This technology is standard 

in 
religious 
and 
academic 

institutions around Europe, but 
the United States has been slow 
to catch on. Facilities equipped 
with hearing loops are few and 
far between; even The Kennedy 
Center in New York City, a 
popular event venue, does not 
make permanent hearing loop 

technology available to its 
patrons. Instead, most venues 
in the United States use FM 
or infrared systems which are 
easier to install but require the 
user to wear a bulky headset, 
which is conspicuous and can 
make the user uncomfortable.

In contrast, all London taxis 

are equipped with hearing 
loops. Most European churches, 
including Westminster Abbey, 
also have hearing loops. With a 
hearing loop, the cumbersome 
headsets are ditched and a 
hearing aid or cochlear implant 
can become the headset, a 
system that is much preferred 
by people who are deaf and 
hard of hearing. The United 
States needs to upgrade its 
technology for people who are 
deaf and hard of hearing and 
what better place to start than 
at the University of Michigan?

While the University has a 

variety of services for those 
with hearing loss listed on 
the Services for Students with 
Disabilities 
site, 
including 

ASL 
interpreters, 
video 

captioning and student note 
takers, hearing loops are not 
mentioned as a service at all, 
even after I requested a list 
of on-campus buildings that 
contained hearing loops. In the 
many classrooms and lecture 
halls I have been in over the 
past year at the University, I 
have not encountered a single 
hearing loop sign. This has 
been frustrating for me in 
larger lecture halls and has 
made it very difficult for me to 
clearly hear the lecturer. The 
previously mentioned services, 
while helpful to many, do not 
cover all the needs of people 
who are hard of hearing. Not 
all people who are hard of 
hearing, 
including 
myself, 

know ASL — and while student 
note takers are helpful, it does 
not allow for much personal 
independence. Hearing loops 
will help meet the needs of 
a larger number of students 
who are hard of hearing at the 
University of Michigan.

The University does a great 

job 
accommodating 
for 
its 

students with disabilities, but 
more can be done. Hearing loop 
technology in lecture halls on 
campus will not only greatly 
improve 
sound 
quality 
for 

students who are hard of hearing 
but will provide independence 
to those using hearing aids 
and cochlear implants. Other 
colleges and universities like 
the University of Iowa and 
Grinnell College have already 
started to introduce hearing 
loop 
technology 
in 
various 

lecture 
halls, 
libraries 
and 

theaters across their campuses. 
Even our rival Spartans have 
installed hearing loops in their 
basketball arena. It’s time for 
the University of Michigan to 
follow suit.

KERRYTOWN CONCERT HOUSE
FX

Literati brings lauded 
U-M novelists together

The 
Kerrytown 
Concert 

House presents the art gallery 
“Textures” 
from 
Sept. 
8 

through Oct. 8. There will 
be a gallery reception with 
refreshments 
on 
Saturday, 

September 16th, from 4 to 6pm, 
free and open to the public.

Work 
from 

Ann 
Arbor 

artists 
Linda 

Colman 
and 

Joan Rosenblum 
will be featured 
in 
the 
exhibit. 

It is the first 
time Kerrytown 
Concert House is 
displaying 
both 

artists’s work.

Colman’s work 

is comprised of 
ceramic 
plates 

which are hung 
on the wall in 
the display. The plates are 
approximately 23 inches in 
diameter 
and 
abstract 
in 

nature.

“I think that people don’t 

normally see these kinds of 
works, as it’s very unusual to be 
able to hang ceramics as an art 
form, because ceramic work 
is usually functional,” said 
Nancy Wolfe, Art Coordinator 
at Kerrytown Concert House.

In Colman’s statement, she 

discusses her ceramic work 
after 30 years of not working 
with clay. She writes that it felt 
like returning to a classroom, 
and she decided to change how 
she worked with clay, choosing 
to make it more visual.

“The last few pieces I’ve 

made feel as though one is 
peering through a pond or a 
puddle of water, where small 
creatures and detritus are seen 
floating midway down or are 
trapped in the compressing 
sediment 
at 
the 
bottom,” 

Coleman wrote. “I suppose 
there 
is 
some 
connection 

with the tidal pools I enjoyed 
photographing when I lived 
by the ocean. I think of tiny, 

no longer living 
things, that are 
undergoing 
the 

slow 
process 

of 
breaking 

down, becoming 
fossilized, 
and 

I am intrigued 
with the notion 
of 
capturing 

small pictures of 
a larger natural 
world 
within 

these forms.” 

Rosenblum’s 

pastel 
work 

is 
inspired 
by 

music, because of its emotional 
impact and sense of rhythm. 
In an email to the Daily, she 
wrote: 
“the 
transference 

of that impact through the 
richness of color applied by 
oils to canvas and pastels to 
paper, is the outcome I hope to 
achieve. Music becomes color 
reflecting the subtlety of the 
converging hues harmonizing 
my work.”

Though strikingly different 

in materials used, process 
and inspiration, their artwork 
evokes similar feelings and 
ideas. 

“I feel like there’s a certain 

sense of extraction to both 
artists’ works,” Wolfe said. 
“There’s both a mystery and an 

intuitive response to art when 
you’re looking at extraction. 
The art doesn’t necessarily 
represent an object, so it takes 
you one step further into the 
mystery.”

Not only do their projects 

evoke similar ideas, but they 
complement and balance each 
other out in how they draw the 
viewer’s attention.

“There’s a certain play to 

having Colman’s works next 
to Rosenblum’s pastels,” Wolfe 
said. “Colman’s work has this 
sense 
of 
subtle 
movement 

but still maintains this very 
powerful place and the feeling 
of meditation.”

Wolfe also noted that it’s 

always special for artists to be 
able to display their works in a 
place other than their studios.

“Art 
is 
about 

communicating,” 
Wolfe 

said. “For both these artists, 
they are working alone and 
going 
through 
a 
process 

and relationship with their 
materials. Their humanity is 
coming together through this 
art, and it needs an audience.”

So... this is awkward.
It’s 
Friday, 
September 
8, 

day three of New York Fashion 
Week 
Spring-Summer 
2018. 

The 
festivities 
are 
in 
full 

swing: 
“Influencers” 
are 

posting 
sponsored 
pictures 

on 
Instagram, 
critics 
are 

complaining, Kanye West is 
being inconsiderate. All is as 
it should be, it appears, until 
a model parades down luxury 
brand Monse’s runway with 
a familiar looking monogram 
poking out from beneath a well-
tailored blazer. As I looked 
through photos of the rest of the 
collection, admiring athleisurely 
touches 
and 
Americana 

references, I couldn’t shake that 
bold letter M from my mind. It 

looked, to me, a bit too familiar.

Maybe 
creative 
directors 

Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim 
are unaware of the resemblance 
between their garment and the 
University of Michigan’s logo. 
Maybe I’m overthinking this, 
and M is just the thirteenth 
letter of the alphabet (please 
fact-check that; I counted on 
my fingers). But Monse is a 
New York-based brand, and U 
of M is a ubiquitous national 
powerhouse. There is no way 
Monse didn’t take a cue from 
the unmistakable and, we should 
mention, trademarked Block-M.

Tthe “Block-M” is a federally 

registered 
trademark. 
This 

means 
that 
the 
logo 
may 

technically 
be 
used 
freely, 

though 
it 
is 
recommended 

that 
mass-produced 
clothing 

featuring 
the 
M 
include 
a 

circle R, or “R-ball” symbol. In 
doing so, the company using 

the trademarked material will 
eliminate 
the 
possibility 
of 

customer confusion, a telltale 
sign of infringement. Use of the 
circle R is a commonplace rule 
in the clothing industry, one that 
Monse has overlooked, or simply 
flat-out ignored.

This isn’t Monse’s first brush 

with the coincidentally chunky 
M (check out the tees they 
released in August), nor will it 
be their last. Will the University 
intervene? Probably not. Monse’s 
version of the popular symbol is 
just different enough to place 
them on the right side of the 
law — think minutely taller and 
narrower. Not to mention, the 
University has bigger fish to fry, 
like combatting campus racism. 
And so the high fashion show 
will go on, unscathed, with naive 
customers shelling out hundreds 
for shirts that they could have 
just bought at the M Den.

COMMUNITY CULTURE

“American Horror Story” 

is an anthology series well-
known for focusing its terrors 
on the supernatural — clowns, 
the paranormal and the (un)
dead are just a few fears that 
“AHS” has lined up in its 
repertoire. For a show built 
upon the concept of fear and 
what is actually considered 
“scary.” 
In 
its 

newest collection, 
“AHS: Cult,” the 
show 
takes 
a 

surprising 
turn 

away 
from 
the 

supernatural 
in 

favor of reality.

The 
opening 

episode 
of 

“Cult” begins on 
Election Night in 
a small Michigan 
town, taken from 
two points of view meant 
to 
encompass 
the 
dueling 

concepts of fear. The natural 
fear of not belonging in a post-
election climate and the fear 
which others use to propel 
their beliefs forward. In a 
liberal household we have Ally 
(Sarah 
Paulson, 
“American 

Crime Story”), who watches 
the election with baited breath 
and vocalizes her frustrations 
when the results are televised. 
Meanwhile, 
blue-haired 

introvert Kai (Evan Peters, 
“X-Men: 
Apocalypse”) 

celebrates the world we’ve 
suddenly 
found 
ourselves 

thrust into, believing that, 
in electing Donald Trump as 
president, 
we’ve 
ultimately 

begun a revolution that will 
change the world for the 
better.

In a quiet manner, “AHS” 

is 
attempting 
to 
mirror 

reality via two extremes. In 
the same small town, Ally 
faces the political aftermath 
and what it will entail for 
herself and her wife (Alison 
Pill, “The Newsroom”), while 
Kai organizes sinister deeds 
in the wake of the “good 
news.” However, that’s not 
to say that neither party is 
free from stereotypes. While 
Ally is portrayed as a liberal 
snowflake, Kai is played off 

as 
deranged, 

bordering 
on 

the 
edge 
of 

psychotic, 
clearly 
following what 
each 
side 
has 

surely slandered 
about 
the 

other. 
As 
the 

run-in 
with 

killer 
clowns 

last 
season 

has taught us, 

“AHS” is paying attention to 
the news.

What is also surprising, 

however, about the seventh 
season of “AHS” is the trading 
of paranormal suspense for 
comedy. A series well known 
on the terror front for their 
scare tactics, “Cult” takes 
on the new season with a 
different approach, attempting 
to balance comedic moments 
with killer clowns in a mix 
that feels too standoffish for 
the series to appropriately 
blend well. While some of the 
characteristic elements of the 
disturbing nature of the show 
are easy to point out — case 
in point, clowns — it feels as 
if it is different from previous 
seasons. On the other hand, 
perhaps 
the 
harmonizing 

relationship 
between 
the 

viewer 
and 
the 
character 

is what will allow this new 
season to resonate well with 
its audience. If one can see 
themselves reflected in what 
they are watching, perhaps 
the fears of reality can outdo 
the fears of the supernatural.

It 
is 
following 
the 

bombshell news of the election 
coverage that “AHS” finally 
opens up on deeper fears, 
morphing into the show that 
we’ve come to know over the 

past few seasons. The world 
suddenly morphs from reality 
to the paranormal — where 
babysitters 
(Billie 
Lourd, 

“Scream 
Queens”) 
harbor 

sinister intentions and clowns 
(John Carroll Lynch, “The 
Founder”) lurk on corners for 
the unsuspecting passerby. All 
things considered, “AHS” is 
asking us whether the world 
has always been full of terrors 
or whether the terrors can 
come to life on their own.

‘May It Last’ mirrors style 
and warmth of Avett Bros.

“May It last: A Portrait of the 

Avett Brothers” is a fun, zesty 
and 
genuine 
documentary 

whose portrayal of the lives and 
creative process of the Avett 
Brothers mirrors the heart 
and warmth of their music. 
The film offers an intimate 
look into the bond between 
Scott and Seth Avett, which 
began in early childhood and 

strengthened 
exponentially 

onward. 
Intensely 
funny, 

the film shines with a vein 
of humor characteristic of 
producer Judd Apatow, yet 
doesn’t fail to explore moments 

of intensity, pain and struggle 
that influence both the band 
members 
and 
their 
music. 

“May It Last” showcases the 
extraordinary talent of the 
brothers as poetic songwriters 
who grapple with the tensions 
of 
the 
commercialization 

of deep emotion, and who 
ultimately 
work 
to 
bring 

beauty from pain and sacrifice. 
With an emphasis on family 
and sincerity, “May It Last” is 
a spectacular illumination of 
the Avett Brothers.

CLASSICAL MUSIC COLUMN

Music as a members 

only club

It’s really not controversial 

to say that classical music has 
a PR problem. As one might 
imagine to be the case for a 
genre several centuries old, 
it’s managed to acquire quite 
a reputation over the years, 
baggage 
generally 
having 

something 
to 
do 
with 
its 

perceived elitism and general 
snobbery. Some of which is 
valid, of course, but mostly 
it’s wildly overblown in the 
popular imagination: At least 
in today’s classical world, for 
every 
tuxedo-toting, 
nose-

thumbing type there’s an equal 
number of open and laid-back 
individuals who just want to 
relax and enjoy making music. 
Naturally the two groups are 
locked in a sort of eternal battle 
for the soul of the genre, and 
invariably the demographics 
of the latter group tend to 
skew younger and the former 
older (though obviously with 
exceptions). 
Much 
of 
this 

isn’t readily visible to large 
segments of the public — 
the days of classical music’s 
skirmishes being fought across 
the culture pages of your 
local newspaper are largely 
over — and honestly it isn’t 
nearly as dramatic as I make 
it sound, but nevertheless this 
vague ideological conflict is 
important, because while the 
genre is nowhere near death 
(no matter what the histrionics 
of the would-be horsemen of 
the cultural apocalypse might 
lead you to believe), its growth 
and appeal are both limited by 
the way it’s perceived.

Sometime in the past (I don’t 

remember where) I referred 
to the programing practices 
of 
most 
major 
orchestras 

as being demonstrative of a 
sort of “antiquated museum 
culture” with a stranglehold 
on the art form — which I 
largely still believe — but that’s 
only part of the problem. Of 
course it’s an issue that most 
orchestras 
overwhelmingly 

program music by mostly male, 
mostly white and mostly dead 
composers. And of course this 
has a lot to do with the culture 
in which the genre developed, 
and it’s been said many times 
before (at this point as almost a 
sort of mantra among the woke 
of the classical community), 
but 
it 
remains 
almost 
as 

relevant as upon its 
first 

utterance. This programing 
disparity is a problem in-and-
of-itself, but one of the other 
issues involved has to do with 
the appearance this reality 
projects. 

Classical 
music, 
perhaps 

more than most genres, suffers 
from being a kind of members-
only club. Or, at least it suffers 
from those who would make 
it so. There is a particular 
demographic who would pick 
up my column, read “classical 
music is elitist,” and respond 

“good.” For a variety of reasons 
— its long history of patronage 
by European aristocracy, the 
expense involved with large-
scale musical presentations, 
dependence 
on 
wealthy 

donors, etc. — classical music 
has a strong association with 
the 
economic 
and 
societal 

elite, and for those who might 
seek to somehow differentiate 
themselves 
from 
everybody 

else, it can serve as a useful, 
class-marked area of interest. 

Consequently, 
concert 

production can often take on a 
character of conservatism and 
passive exclusion. Usually it’s 
small things, like dirty looks 
directed at someone who claps 
between movements, a mild 
distaste for the neophytes who 
haven’t learned the rituals, 
but cumulatively it creates an 
atmosphere that isolates the 
art form from the world at large 
and stifles its engagement with 
contemporary society. More 

often than not it seems that 
the musicians themselves (at 
least in my experience) are 
discontent with this state of 
affairs, and it’s more a product 
of the patrons and/or donors, 
but the developments in this 
war of ideas will likely provide 
the future direction of the 
genre.

Part 
of 
this 
ideological 

combat broke out into the 
foreground of a few very 
particular and niche online 
communities 
last 
weekend. 

Two Facebook groups, one 
the much older “Pretentious 
Classical Music Elitists” and 

the other the younger “Prelude, 
Fugue, 
and 
Shitpost,” 
got 

into a little scuffle over the 
stuffiness of classical music. 
Doubtless you can sort out 
where the battle lines were 
drawn. But these two groups 
are 
fascinating 
because 

they serve as almost perfect 
archetypes of the two schools 
of thought. The former’s name 
was originally meant to be 
tongue-in-cheek, but over the 
years it seems as if many of 
its members didn’t quite pick 
that up. There is plenty of 
valuable musical discussion 
to be had there, and there are 
lots of subsections within it 
of interest, but on the whole 
its tastes tend to constitute 
a 
staid 
and 
conventional 

veneration of the Classical and 
Romantic eras, coupled with 
an embrace of the “elitist” title 
and a certain looking-down 
on other musical genres. This 
rubbed the vaguely anarchistic 
members of PFS the wrong way, 
and they began a campaign 
inside PCME to shitpost in 
exaggerated, imitation PCME 
manner in order to knock the 
other group down a peg. 

PFS is a curious bunch: 

Mostly students at university or 
conservatory, they constitute a 
kind of anti-elite elite, that is 
to say, they’re not not elitists, 
but their elitism is directed 
towards the breaking down 
of old systems of thought, and 
their musical tastes tend to be 
an aesthetic free-for-all. In a 
certain sense they remind me 
of some of the American and 
British communists of the ’30s, 
the anti-bourgeois bourgeois 
intellectuals 
common 
at 

literary cafés and universities 
before everyone realized that 
Stalin was a homicidal maniac 
who only cared about his own 
power.

The meme war was brief, 

and retribution was swift: 
deletions, bannings, the lot. It 
was mostly over in a weekend. 
Ridiculous as it was, though, 
the 
event 
says 
something 

interesting about the place 
that classical music culture 
(particularly among the young) 
is in today. If the young in PFS 
are any indication, the genre 
is due for its own Glasnost 
and Perestroika, and perhaps 
this will lead to a wider 
appeal. In certain modes of 
thinking, there is a conflation 
of seriousness of the self with 
seriousness of the art. If you 
hold yourself too cheaply, the 
thinking goes, then the art 
you make will come out cheap 
as well. And perhaps there’s a 
certain truth in that, but at the 
same time, if you take yourself 
too seriously in any art form 
there’s a very real danger that 
it will implode in on itself and 
become 
directionless. 
And 

that’s the quickest path to 
irrelevancy.

‘Marie Curie’ is not as 
inspiring as its subject

FILM

“Marie Curie: The Courage of 

Knowledge” is all grace. Filled 
with soft colors, a delicate 
score and a subtly compelling 
lead performance by Karolina 
Gruszka 
(“Salvation”), 
the 

story drifts gently through 
the brilliant scientist’s life, 
floating along through her 
most intimate moments. We 
follow Curie through the death 
of her husband, her greatest 
discoveries, her eventual affair 
and her lifelong struggle to 

be recognized by the brutally 
male-dominated 
scientific 

community. Gruszka’s Curie 
is icy, her face impassive 

and unreadable but for a few 
moments of raw emotionality 
that 
peek 
through 
the 

necessarily 
hard 
facade. 

There’s a quiet vulnerability 
to 
her 
performance 
that 

grounds the otherwise airy 
and ethereal film. But there’s 
a fundamental dissonance at 
the heart of the movie. “Marie 
Curie” has a lot it wants to say 
about love, curiosity, science 
and life’s trials — but it’s so 
self-consciously artful that it 
ends up saying very little at 
all. It’s a very pretty film, but 
its substance is lost in all the 
paper-thin, gossamer beauty.

It was recently announced 

that 
Nike 
would 
be 

collaborating with Off-White, 
one of the hottest streetwear 
brands 
around. 
This 

collaboration comes only a few 
weeks after Nike ended their 
partnership 
with 
VLONE, 

another popular streetwear 
brand, after sexual assault 
allegations 
surrounding 

its co-founder, A$AP Bari, 
surfaced. 
The 
collection 

will feature familiar Nike 
sneaker silhouettes with an 
added twist from Off-White 

mastermind, 
Virgil 
Abloh. 

None 
of 
the 
designs 
are 

particularly groundbreaking: 
The shoes are simply popular 
models (Jordan 1s, Blazers, Air 
Prestos, etc.) with the word 
“AIR” printed on one side and 
the branding “OFF-WHITE 
for NIKE / (Insert Model 
Name 
Here) 
/ 
Beaverton, 

Oregon USA / c. 2017” on the 
other.

Collaborations like this one 

help draw attention to existing 
Nike models, an initiative 
that’s extremely important as 
Nike continues its competition 
with other sneaker brands. 
Even though these sneakers 
will be released in scarce 

numbers, 
the 
collaboration 

will bring consumers’ eyes to 
the existing shoes that Nike 
offers as an alternative for 
those who fail to cop. Soon 
you’ll 
see 
people 
wearing 

Nike’s VaporMax or Air Presto 
sneakers as a “poor man”’s 
Nike x Off-White.

If 
you’re 
interested 
in 

picking up a pair of the 
sneakers, good luck (unless 
you’re willing to pay $1000+). 
These sneakers are guaranteed 
to sell out instantly and be 
resold at 5-10 times the price. 
If you somehow manage to 
get a pair, consider buying a 
lottery ticket, because you 
must be quite lucky.

COMMUNITY CULTURE

Literati brings lauded 
U-M novelists together

Peter Ho Davies and Derek 

Palacio talk fate, fiction and the 
meaning of home. They have 
the kind of professional and 
personal friendship all aspiring 
authors would hope for. After 
meeting through Palacio’s wife, 
fiction star Claire Vaye Watkins, 
they’ve both taught 
at 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan, 

championed 
each 

other’s 
work 
and 

played soccer with 
their MFA students 
on the weekends.

Last year, both the 

authors 
published 

novels which have 
earned them critical recognition 
and literary attention. Davie’s 
second novel, “The Fortunes,” 
loosely connects four stories of 
the Chinese-American experience 
through space and time, while 
Palacio’s 
debut 
novel 
“The 

Mortification” follows a Cuban-
American family as they navigate a 
new life in New England.

You’ve both written fiction for 

many years, of course, but you also 
both teach creative writing here at 
Michigan. How does this process 
of teaching new writers inform 
your own practice? Or, maybe, it 
doesn’t, and you view them as two 
very separate endeavors?

Davies: Good students — and 

we’re lucky to have excellent ones 
here —keep you on your toes! Their 
work is so distinctive, so individual, 
that I feel I’m often learning from 
it, as I often do from hearing what 
they’re reading. More than this 
though, their passion for writing, 
their commitment to their work, is 
often simply inspiring.

Palacio: 
They’re 
pretty 

complementary for me. I’ve been 
very fortunate to teach in very 
different settings. Michigan is 
very different from the IEIA [the 
Institute of American Indian Arts 
MFA, where Palacio also teaches] 
program. And from the Mojave 
School [a writing program started 
by Palacio and his wife, Claire 
Vaye Watkins, for students in rural 
Nevada].

Let’s talk a little bit more 

in-depth about each of your most 
recent novels, “The Mortifications” 
and “The Fortunes.” Both titles 
evoke a mystic or religious theme, 
and this theme is extended through 
the novels with discussions of 
the role of fate or destiny in the 
narrative, as well as human agency. 
What drew you to this theme?

Davies: I want to suggest with 

“The Fortunes” the mixture of luck 
and fate that shapes the characters’ 
lives, but the title, of course, is also 
a reference to that most common 
Chinese-American signifier, the 
fortune cookie. Everyone knows 
the fortune cookie isn’t really 
Chinese (you don’t get fortune 
cookies in restaurants in China, of 
course) but something about how 
bogusly Chinese they are makes me 
think of them as humbly, but also 
authentically Chinese-American.

Palacio: 
There’s 
a 
lot 
of 

wonderful immigrant fiction out 
there about coming to America 
and assimilating, finding your 
place. But there are also wonderful 
stories — and this is where “The 
Mortifications” leans — about the 
impossibility of ever feeling that 
this is your home. The question 
most immigrants have to ask is: 
What would my life have been 
like if I’d stayed? There’s always 
these two tracks of comparison, 

and 
because 

you 
can’t 
ever 

fully leave your 
culture 
behind, 

or fully embrace 
the new culture 
in which you live, 
it’s a question you 
carry with you 
always. The idea 
of destiny and fate 

in this book is woven into the idea 
of family — what might have been 
had they stayed.

Derek, “The Mortifications” is 

billed as a new take on the Cuban-
American immigrant narrative. 
Stylistically, it could be seen as 
more restrained, something that 
you don’t come across much 
in older classics of the Cuban-
American 
literary 
tradition. 

Thematically, it takes place in 
New England, far from Cuban-
American strongholds like Miami. 
Was this use of language and 
location a response to the colorful, 
over-the-top exuberance of older 
narratives in this tradition? Or was 
it less a reaction to this tradition, 
than simply a reflection of your 
own voice and experience?

Palacio: I don’t know if I was 

really trying to differentiate or push 
away from that. There’s a lot of stuff 
in here — the food, characters such 
as Uxbal [the father left behind in 
Cuba] — that is a ridge between 
these two literary traditions. On 
my father’s side I’m technically a 
first generation American. So from 
that perspective, I’m not that far 
from Cuba, but I also grew up in 
New Hampshire, and I don’t speak 
Spanish. So I was really trying to 
write about the Cubans I knew, 
which was my family growing up in 
New England. I don’t know if we’re 
more restrained — we’re probably 
just more “New England.”

I wanted to talk to you both 

about the vital role women play 
in your narratives. The mother, 
as a recurring symbol and as a 
living, breathing person, crops 
up in both your works quite a bit. 
In “The Mortifications,” she’s an 
immensely important character 
who in fact sets the narrative in 
motion by moving the family to 
the U.S. and leaving her husband 
behind. Significant mother figures, 
absent or present, also weave their 
way through each story in “The 
Fortunes.” Why was it important 
to feature these mothers, and how 
did you try to better understand 
and portray them?

Davies: Parenthood has been a 

theme in my fiction for a while now 
(even before I was a parent, writing 
about it was a kind of rehearsal!) 
but you’re right that mothers play 
a key role in each section of The 
Fortunes. That likely reflects their 
importance in immigrant stories, 

in settling, in creating homes and 
families, in nurturing successive 
generations.

Palacio: I finished the book 

before our kid was born — we have 
a three-year-old now. But with 
Soledad [the novel’s matriarch], 
and for the rest of the characters to 
a degree, this is a book that didn’t 
want to stray much from the big 
questions. When I was writing 
Soledad, I had that question that 
parents who move their families 
have to always ask: Am I glad I did 
that? You’re ripping them from one 
world and putting them in another. 
What does that leave you in the 
new world? Is that a power you can 
invoke again and again, or is that 
a power that diminishes, because 
you’ve already exercised it? Maybe 
you only get to do that once in their 
lives. Isabel [Soledad’s daughter] 
gets a long leash, but that’s a 
freedom that comes in the wake of 
disrupting Isabel’s early childhood 
in Cuba. As a parent, I’m living 
[some of these questions] now.

There 
is, 
at 
times, 
an 

undercurrent of sensuality or 
sexuality that runs through both 
your works, yet it doesn’t play 
into stereotypes or conventional 
mainstream notions of Chinese, 
Cuban, 
Chinese-American 
or 

Cuban-American sexuality. For 
instance, Chinese sex workers are 
portrayed as neither exotic sirens 
nor alluring victims, and Cuban-
American mother Soledad gains 
stature in the United States not 
from her “tropical” sensuality, 
but 
from 
her 
cautious, 
cool 

professionalism. How do you side-
step adding to the over-sexualized 
portrayals of Asian and Latin 
American women in the United 
States, 
without 
making 
your 

characters seem frigid or flat?

Davies: There are a lot of 

stereotypes, both about Asian 
women and men, and I wanted 
less to side-step them than to 
confront them. For instance, the 
character of Anna May Wong, the 
first Chinese-American movie star, 
who helped create some of those 
very stereotypes, but who was 
also imprisoned — personally and 
professionally — by them. [This] 
was a great way to address and 
then undermine stereotypes.

Palacio: You’re always hoping 

that you’re treating every character, 
regardless of gender, as a full 
individual with their own sense of 
desire. With Soledad, there was 
some element of wanting her to 
find some joy somewhere along 
the way in this journey. With 
[my characters], Soledad and 
Isabel, I was very lucky. I can’t 
claim any deliberateness in my 
fortune with them. They were 
just such powerful people, and 
I’ve been lucky to know a lot of 
powerful women in my life. My 
mother is a very strong presence 
in my life, when I think of her 
personality and how she moves 
through the world, and my wife 
is a complete and total genius 
and champion. I’ve been lucky to 
be surrounded by these women, 
so I can’t think of women in any 
other way. I try not to, and I try 
to remember that when I come 
to the page.

SHOWTIME

‘Twin Peaks’ finale fulfills 
decades-old ambitions

The beauty of mystery and 

the uncanny in “Twin Peaks” 
has always been its strongest 
asset. Lynch and company 
never strive to produce a show 
that’s 
obvious, 
self-evident 

or plain. As a result, “Twin 
Peaks” is a deeply polarizing 
show: You can choose to 
reject the lack of structure, 
or 
embrace 
the 

sidewinding, 
glacial 
pace. 

Unsurprisingly, 
the 
program 

rewards 
the 

second approach 
more 
than 
the 

first. 
For 
those 

who stuck around, the series 
finale offered more questions 
than answers, concluding the 
series without being heavy-
handed.

Released together, “Part 17” 

and “Part 18” complete the trek 
of the series that was cut short. 
At an accidental rendezvous, 
Special Agent Dale Cooper’s 
doppelganger 
(Kyle 

McLachlan, “Portlandia”) is 
shot by none other than Lucy 
Brennan (Kimmy Robertson, 
“Beauty 
and 
the 
Beast”). 

This occurrence is a high 
water mark for the plausible, 
yet still absurd addition of 
comedy to moments of intense 
gravity. 
The 
manifestation 

of BOB’s energy is broken 
by 
Freddie 
Sykes 
(Jake 

Wardle, 
“something”), 
and 

then doppelganger Cooper is 
quickly sent back to the Black 
Lodge by real Cooper. The 
series ends here, right? Wrong.

While the key narrative 

threads 
have 
been 
tied 

together, the majority of the 
finale is devoted to Cooper’s 
re-undertaking of the case 

of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee, 
“Wild at Heart”). It feels alien 
to re-encounter this major 
element 
because 
so 
much 

of “The Return” was spent 
outside of Twin Peaks. Still, 
Cooper as the hero restored 
acts as if he had never left, 
preventing her murder after 
Philip 
Jeffries 
(a 
cameo 

by the late David Bowie) 
transports him to the night of 
the event. The morning that 
follows, however, Laura still 
disappears.

The 
events 

which 
follow 

Cooper’s 
apparent rescue 
of Laura seem 
extraneous and 
unrelated.

For audiences 

that 
were 

looking for closure, the series 
may as well end there for 
them. Cooper returns to the 
Black Lodge again, and is 
escorted out by Diane. They 
leave, drive down a long desert

over,” and arrive at a motel to 
have sex. Diane (Laura Dern, 
“Big Little Lies”) revealed in 
“Part 16” that the multiple 
iterations 
of 
one 
person 

(although not doppelgangers) 
are 
called 
tulpas, 
coming 

from the tradition of Tibetan 
Buddhism. Tulpas are beings 
that are born into existence 
by strong spiritual or mental 
powers — somewhat like an 
imaginary 
friend. 
Dougie 

Jones (still Kyle McLachlan) is 
an example of a tulpa, created 
by Cooper’s doppelganger.

In the morning, Cooper 

wakes up alone, and reads 
a letter on the bed stand 
addressed to Richard from 
Linda. He proceeds to find 
a 
Laura 
Palmer 
lookalike, 

Carrie

(Sheryl 
Lee), 

and attempts to reunite her 
with her mother. When they 

arrive at Laura’s old address, 
a stranger answers, denying 
any connection to the Palmer 
family. Carrie and Cooper turn 
away and prepare to leave, but 
not before Cooper senses a 
disturbance. Carrie screams 
the 
iconic 
Laura 
Palmer 

scream, and the power goes 
out. Credits roll.

For those expecting a clean 

ending, 
the 
unfolding 
of 

events may be confusing. Who 
are Richard and Linda? Why 
is Laura Palmer back, again? 
Where did Diane and Cooper 
cross over to? None of these 
questions are the right ones to 
ask. “Twin Peaks” has never 
operated at a literal level, so 
the audience is pointed to the 
greater concepts of the series. 
Strong will and determination 
can take human form; good 
and evil are constantly at 
war; spirits and magic hide 
in plain sight. “Twin Peaks: 
The Return” may not have 
been 
the 
series 
audiences 

anticipated, but it is the series 
that delivered an appropriate, 
creatively rich conclusion.

Freshman midfielder Sarah Stratigakis was among the freshman class that was a silver lining in Michigan’s draw.

Michigan draws again, 
difficulties continue

If a game was one half instead 

of two, the Michigan women’s 
soccer team (0-1 Big Ten, 3-1-4 
overall) would have finished 
feeling like it had just won. 

The score might have been 0-0, 

but the Wolverines dominated 
the shot and possession battles. 
Unfortunately 
for 
Michigan, 

though, the game lasted until 
the 83rd minute, and that’s when 
Purdue (1-0, 6-2) scored the 
game-winning goal.

During its impressive first half, 

Michigan managed seven shots — 
but its most impressive work came 
in the buildup to those shots. The 
Wolverines had good movement 
around the box and put plenty of 
balls into play, but they weren’t 
able to get many shots off.

“There 
are 
games 
when 

things just click,” said junior 
forward Taylor Timko. “From the 
backline up, I think the effort was 
there. We just didn’t execute, and 
I think the biggest thing is to just 

use this as a learning experience.”

The best chance for Michigan 

came just 10 minutes into the 
game. Fifth-year senior forward 
Ani Sarkisian had a breakaway, 
where the goalkeeper was all that 
stood in the way of a potential 
Wolverine lead.

A Boilermaker defender was 

right on her heels, and Sarkisian 
couldn’t get the shot off before 
she 
became 
entangled 
with 

the goalkeeper and defender. 
Sarkisian was quick on her 
feet, though, and poked the ball 
backwards for junior forward 
Reilly Martin to run onto. But the 
chance was lost and Purdue put 
a toe on the ball to clear it out of 
harm’s way.

The second half saw a whole 

new side of the Boilermakers. 
They instantly put pressure on 
Michigan’s backline and rattled 
off 11 shots in the second half 
alone — one of those being the 
late goal.

Taking 
advantage 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
young 
defense, 

Purdue midfielder Kylie Hase 

found herself unmarked in the 
box, and the long pass landed 
right at her feet. There was 
nothing senior goalkeeper Sarah 
Jackson could do. She could only 
watch as Hase pounded it into the 
back of the goal.

While the Wolverines had 

chances in the second half — 
including a shot from Timko that 
hit the crossbar — as soon as the 
Boilermakers went up a goal, 
Michigan clearly looked deflated.

The loss marks the second 

straight 
game 
where 
the 

Wolverines have been shut out 
at home — something that hasn’t 
happened since 2013.

“To win Big Ten games, your 

seniors and your juniors, they 
gotta step up,” said Michigan 
coach Greg Ryan. “They gotta 
find ways to win games for you, so 
the challenge is on to score some 
goals. We scored two goals in four 
games. The problem with staying 
0-0 is anything can happen in 
a game like soccer and it finally 
did. So, we’re going to have to 
start putting some points on the 
board.”

Currently, Michigan has four 

injured starters — most notably, 
junior midfielder Abby Kastroll 
— which may be contributing to 
its goal shortage. Kastroll scored 
five goals for the Wolverines last 
season and had already scored 
two this season prior to her injury 
in the sixth game of the year.

But that shouldn’t be an excuse. 

Michigan has plenty of talent on 
its roster and, though it may have 
young players, there are many 
veterans that are capable of taking 
over a game. The Wolverines 
didn’t start conference play the 
way they hoped, but Ryan will 
now look to the upperclassman to 
pick up the rest of the team and 
prepare for Indiana on Sunday.

“If you want to score goals, 

you need to get your chances 
right in front of the keeper, right 
where they got theirs, and we just 
never created that tonight,” Ryan 
said. “This was a team we really 
thought we could get after and 
get at, and it just didn’t happen 
for us tonight.”

The Michigan football team’s matchup against Cincinnati didn’t 
end up as lopsided as many expected, but the Wolverines still 
notched a 36-14 victory. Next up is Air Force — a team famous 
for running the unconventional triple-option offense. The unique

but the Wolverines are looking to enter Big Ten play undefeated.

What to Watch For: Air Force

Coming off a scare against 

Cincinnati, the No. 7 Michigan 
football team has faced a fair 
amount of criticism for allowing 
the Bearcats to hang around late 
into the game. Against Air Force 
on Saturday, the Wolverines 
have set their sights on putting 
that performance firmly in the 
past.

With 
the 
Falcons 
rolling 

into Ann Arbor this weekend, 
Michigan has a chance to finish 
its non-conference season on a 
high note before Big Ten play 
begins.

Here’s what to watch for when 

the Wolverines take on Air Force:

1. Will Ty Isaac hit 100 

again?

After 
starting 
behind 

sophomore Chris Evans in the 
season opener, the fifth-year 
senior running back has emerged 
as the leader of Michigan’s three-
man rotation in the backfield 
with two consecutive games in 
which he has run for over 100 
yards. 

In his fourth year in the 

program 
after 
transferring 

from 
Southern 
California, 

Isaac has “capitalized on his 
opportunities” 
according 
to 

coach Jim Harbaugh. He rushed 
for a game-high 114 yards on just 
11 carries against Florida, and 
in his second career start, he 
rushed for 133 yards — a career 
high — on 20 carries against 
Cincinnati.

Rather 
than 
acting 
as 
a 

complement to the shifty, speedy 
Evans — who had been expected 
to take over the lead rusher 
role this year — Isaac has taken 
over where last year’s starter 
De’Veon Smith left off as the 
power back of the Wolverines’ 
run game.

Isaac has yet to make his way 

into the end zone, but with his 
recent string of solid outings, 
there is a high probability that 
he will break that trend against 
Air Force.

2. How many points will the 

defense score?

21-17. The latter is the number 

of points Michigan’s defense has 
given up this season. The former 

is the number of points the 
Wolverine defense has scored.

Between 
two 
pick-sixes 

against 
the 
Bearcats 
and 
a 

fumble recovery in the end zone 
against the Gators, Michigan 
has not only played lockdown 
defense, but has 
turned 
stops 

into 
scoring 

opportunities as 
well.

While 
the 

offense 
and 

special 
teams 

units have made 
a 
considerable 

number 
of 

costly mistakes, 
Michigan 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown’s unit has avoided a 
similar fate. Acting as the calm 
within the storm, the defense 
has provided a stabilizing force 
so far this year.

Air Force might disrupt that 

trend, though. With their triple-
option style offense, the Falcons 
could pose a strong challenge to 
the Wolverines’ defense. From 
trick plays to deceptive schemes, 

Air Force will throw its whole 
playbook at Michigan. While 
the Wolverines have said that 
they have been preparing for 
this game since the spring, their 
defense will have a harder time 
keeping up its scoring streak 

against the Falcons.

3. Will Quinn 

Nordin 
have 

another chance to 
show off his leg?

The 
redshirt 

freshman 
kicker 

made 
a 
name 

for 
himself 
after 

nailing 4 of 6 field 
goals, 
including 

two from more than 50 yards out, 
against Florida. Of Michigan’s 33 
total points, Nordin scored 12. 
If he had made the other two 
kicks, he would have outscored 
Florida’s 17-point total all on his 
own.

With the performance, Nordin 

owns the record for the longest 
field goal made at AT&T Stadium 
(55 yards) and is the only 
freshman Wolverine ever to hit 

two 50-plus-yard field goals in 
the same game.

Against Cincinnati, Nordin 

had a noticeably less prominent 
role, though that’s actually more 
of a positive for the Wolverines’ 
offense as a whole than a negative 
for him.

With 

Air 
Force’s 

unpredictable 
offense, 
the 

Falcons 
could 

end up scoring 
more 
than 

expected 
due 

to trickery as 
opposed to skill. 
If that proves 
to be the case 
Saturday, Michigan may need 
Nordin to provide a stable source 
of points. 

4. Can Speight avoid turning 

the ball over?

After two games where his 

position as the starter has been 
called into question, the redshirt 
junior quarterback has a chance 
to silence his critics against an 

Air Force team that leaves the 
secondary vulnerable with a 
blitz-heavy scheme.

Most of Speight’s wounds 

have been self-inflicted — from 
his 
two 
pick-sixes 
against 

Florida to his two fumbles 

against Cincinnati 
— so the onus is 
on him. One of the 
first lessons taught 
to young players 
learning the game 
is to take care of the 
football. 
Speight 

needs to heed that 
lesson against the 
Falcons.

Despite 
his 

mistakes, 
Speight 

has still completed 28 of 54 
passes for 402 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
Throughout 
the 

week, 
his 
teammates 
have 

wholeheartedly defended their 
quarterback, depicting him as 
their unquestioned leader.

If Speight can just clean up 

the errors, he can convince the 
Wolverines’ supporters calling 
for his job to see him in the same 
light.

On Aug. 26, the University of 
Michigan turned 200 years 
old.
One 
week 
later, 
Robert 

“Pete” Piotrowski celebrated 
his 100th birthday.
Yes, Piotrowski has been 
around for half of the univer-
sity’s existence. Yes, he has 
seen and heard it all. 
When he was a child, he lis-

tened to the famous sports 
broadcaster Ty Tyson give 
play-by-play 
of 
Michigan 

football games on the radio. 
Piotrowski later rode the 
same train as Tyson and the 
rest of the team as they trav-
eled to games.
When he was in seventh 
grade, Piotrowski would play 
football with his classmates 
during recess and pretend 
he was Bennie Oosterbaan, 
one of the greatest athletes in 
Michigan history. And when 
Piotrowski 
came 
to 
Ann 

Arbor, there was Oosterbaan, 
serving as an assistant coach.
When he was a reserve on 
the varsity team, Piotrowski 

came across halfback Tom 
Harmon. At the time, Har-
mon was a freshman not 
allowed to play on varsity; 
his star had yet to be born. 
One day, Piotrowski lined up 
against Harmon in a tackling 
drill.
A lot of people can say 
they’ve tackled a Heisman 
Trophy winner. Not many 
still around can say the same 
about Harmon.
“You knew who (Harmon) 

was,” 
Piotrowski 
recalled 

in an interview this week at 
his retirement home in Novi. 
“They brought him in, and 
they knew he was going to be 
good. You saw him sometimes 
during drills, in tackling 
drills or something. You’d 
tackle him if he happened to 
be in one of the lines.
“It was just a guy coming 
down the line and you’d tack-
le him. Wasn’t a big deal.”
It may not have been a big 
deal at the time, but looking 
back, it is. That’s the story of 
Piotrowski’s Michigan legacy 
— his career may have never 
got far off the ground, but his 
experiences provide a win-

dow through nearly a centu-
ry of Michigan history.
***
As hard as it may be to believe 
now, Michigan went 77 years 
without a gymnasium on its 
campus.
According to a report from 
the 
Bentley 
Historical 

Library, regents had dis-
cussed a facility “as early 
as 1870,” but the state legis-
lature was in dire financial 
straits and couldn’t fund 

the project. In 1891, though, 
a generous donation from 
Joshua W. Waterman kick-
started a spirited fundraising 
effort from the University. By 
1894, Waterman Gymnasium 
stood at 930 North Univer-
sity Avenue.
The Waterman gym was a 
work of art. It was 150 feet 
tall and had an appearance 
more befitting of a castle 
than a recreational facility.
Piotrowski was a frequent 
visitor to the gym — both 
Waterman and other facili-
ties — when he enrolled at 
Michigan in the fall of 1935. 
In fact, that was where he 
earned a spot on the Michi-

gan football team during the 
winter of his freshman year.
“(Assistant 
coach) 
Wally 

Weber called me,” Piotrows-
ki said, “and asked me to 
meet him at the gym.”
Earlier, 
Weber 
and 
head 

coach Harry Kipke had vis-
ited schools up north looking 
for players to recruit. When 
they 
reached 
Piotrowski’s 

high school, his old coach 
told them there was already 
a player in Ann Arbor that 

could make the team.
So Piotrowski went to the 
gym after the phone call. 
There, he met Kipke, Weber 
and “a couple linemen.”
Piotrowski was never a large 
man, even in his youth. He 
says he weighed 167 pounds 
during his playing career. 
Yet that day he displayed 
an 
unnatural 
amount 
of 

strength.
“They had one of the exer-
cise machines that you push 
with your shoulders, two 
guys,” Piotrowski said. “And 
I did pretty well, I could do 
a little better than the line-
men did. (Kipke) must’ve 
been impressed, anyways. So 

I ended up on the Michigan 
football team.”
***
Piotrowski didn’t pick Mich-
igan because of its football 
team. He did so for a more 
practical reason — he wanted 
to attend pharmacy school.
And though he was on the 
team, being a football player 
was neither the glamorous 
nor time-consuming job that 
it is now. No one stopped 
him on the street for pho-

tos. There was no stipend 
from the athletic department 
to pay for room and board. 
Piotrowski paid for living 

costs by working as a dish-
washer and waiter at a den-
tal fraternity “way up Hill 

Street.”
Eventually, he joined a fra-
ternity, Kappa Sigma, and 
lived there for the rest of his 
time on campus. That was 
how he met his wife.
“It 
was 
a 
blind 
date,” 

Piotrowski recalled. “One of 
my fraternity brothers had a 
girl over there he knew and 
I guess I didn’t have a date, 
and he fixed up a date with 
my wife, Jean. And we went 
together after that, since my 

sophomore year.”
Football, it appears, was sim-
ply there in Piotrowski’s life, 
and nothing more. He had 
never thought he would make 
it on the team and was cer-
tainly glad for the opportu-
nity. But it didn’t rule his life. 
Playing professionally wasn’t 
an option and he didn’t want 
to be a football or basketball 
coach, which he says was the 
reason many players were on 
the team.
The Wolverines, meanwhile, 
were in the midst of a brutal 
four-year stretch. Through 
Piotrowski’s sophomore and 
junior seasons in 1936 and 
1937, Michigan went a com-

bined 5-12. By the end of 
the 1937 season, Kipke’s 
tenure was near its end.
“Kipke was already let 
know that he wasn’t going 
to be rehired,” Piotrowski 
said. “But none of us knew, 
nobody knew that. Kipke 
wanted to hold onto his 
job, he had Tom Harmon 
coming up as a freshman 
then.”
That transitory period — 
and Kipke’s efforts to hold 
onto his job — seem to 
have cost Piotrowski his 
only chance at becoming a 
starter.
According to Piotrowski, 
he had appeared in sev-
eral 
games 
throughout 

his career, playing half-
back most of the time 
while occasionally being 
employed 
as 
a 
tackler. 

Then, on the suggestion of 
the trainer, he had tried 
out for fullback, and “did 
pretty well at that.”
He expected to start at 
Penn during the second-
to-last week of the 1937 
season, which would have 
earned him a varsity letter. 
But that never happened.
“Someone 
didn’t 
want 

me in there, or wanted 
someone else to start,” 
Piotrowski recalled. “So I 
was kinda shut out. It was 
the team before the Ohio 
State 
game. 
But 
Kipke 

came to me the following 
Monday at practice and 
apologized for not playing 
me.
“I was only a kid then, I 
didn’t say anything. He 
says, ‘I couldn’t play you.’ I 
think he was hanging onto 
his job.”
The next year, Piotrowski 
quit the team. It happened 
just as easily — and natu-
rally — as him joining. He 
wanted to continue court-
ing Jean, and he didn’t see 
a long-term future in the 
sport.
Losing out on the chance 
to start was tough for 
Piotrowski to swallow at 
the time, and his brow 
furrowed 
slightly 
when 

recalling the incident 80 
years later. But he says he 
was alright with the deci-
sion, and he’s moved on.
“Some little things you 
remember,” 
Piotrowski 

said, “but you just forgive 
and you forget. … I can kind 
of forget things like that 
pretty fast.
“There’s a lot going on at 
Michigan. (My) last year, I 

went to the 
gym a lot.”

room for an 
expansion of 
the Chemis-
try Building.
To 
expect 

Michigan’s 
campus 
to 
remain 

mostly 
unchanged 
since 
Piotrowski’s 
matricula-
tion 
would 

be 
irratio-

nal. 
Many 

of the expe-
riences 
he 

described 
are a glance 
into a sepia-
toned past.
Piotrowski 
loved 
to 

bowl at the 
Union with 
friends. 
Once, 
he 

earned 
a 

t-shirt as the 
bowler of the 
week. There is no bowling in 
the Union anymore, but there 
is a Wendy’s.
He used to buy a sweet roll 
and coffee for 
breakfast at a 
price of just 15 
cents. Tuition 
per 
semester 

was $50.
He found suc-
cess at full-
back 
at 
the 

cradle of col-
lege 
football 

weighing just 
167 
pounds. 

Khalid 
Hill 

and 
Henry 

Poggi 
weigh 

263 and 257 
pounds, 
respectively.
Piotrowski 
estimates 
he 

was 
85 
the 

last time he 
attended 
a 

game in Ann 
Arbor. He says 
he’d get lost if he tried walk-
ing around campus nowa-
days.
Yes, 
some 
things 
have 

changed 
since 
Robert 

Piotrowski attended classes 

at Michigan. But the spir-
it of it all — that remains 
unchanged.
Piotrowski remembers the 
weekends spent downtown 

drinking 
beer with his 
fraternity 
brothers. 
He 

remembers 
frantically 
cramming 
late at night 
for tests. He 
remembers 
the pride of 
walking onto 
the 
field 
in 

front of a sold-
out crowd at 
Michigan Sta-
dium, only a 
couple 
years 

after 
play-

ing in front 
of 
sparsely-

populated 
bleachers 
in 

Manistee.
And he still 
remembers 

why he went to Michigan in 
the first place, and what it 
gave him.
“I’m glad I went to Michigan 
because you learn some of 
the finer things,” Piotrows-

ki said. “Classical music. 
Go to concerts, which you 
wouldn’t do if you lived in a 
small town. They didn’t have 
anything like that. … I’d go 
back (home) to visit quite 
often, of course. But there’s 
more opportunities (in Ann 
Arbor), things you learn 
going to school, in a frater-
nity.
“Sometimes you lie in bed 
and Ann Arbor comes up to 
you. These little things that 
you never thought of for 
years come up. I’m glad I 
went to a bigger school. Oth-
erwise I would’ve ended up 
back in Manistee and I don’t 
know what I’d be doing.”
Later in his life, long after 
graduation, Piotrowski trav-
eled the world with Jean. 
He went to China, Japan, 
New Zealand, Australia and 
South America. Those trips, 
he says, wouldn’t have hap-
pened 
without 
Michigan. 

The 
university 
“enabled” 

him to think about all the 
possibilities — such as trav-
eling the world — that he 
never would have thought 
about in Manistee.
“I was looking for something 
more,” 
Piotrowski 
said, 

“which I got at Michigan.”

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Air Force

About a week ago, everybody 

seemed to think the Wolverines 
were unstoppable. An offseason 
full of questions and concerns 
was put to rest when the 
Michigan football team stomped 
Florida in the biggest season 
opener it has had in years. 

Then came the Cincinnati 

game. It should have been an 
easier win, but it turned into 
a reality check instead. The 
Wolverines left the game with 
a second win, but there was 
undoubtedly room — and a need 
— to improve leading up to the 
Big Ten season.

No. 
7 
Michigan’s 
final 

non-conference game is this 
Saturday against Air Force, a 
disciplined opponent with a 
unique offense that has had two 
weeks to prepare.

The Falcons crushed Virginia 

Military Institute (VMI), 62-0, 
in their season opener two 
weeks ago, and haven’t played a 
game since. That said, Michigan 
is a 23.5-point favorite to win.

Here’s how the Wolverines 

match up against Air Force on 
Saturday.

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Air Force pass defense

Even though redshirt junior 

quarterback Wilton Speight has 
had some shaky moments already 
this season, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh has clearly stated 
that Speight will remain the 
starting quarterback. Speight 
has completed 52 percent of his 
passes, and has tallied 402 yards 
with three touchdowns and two 
interceptions.

Despite the two pick-sixes, 

Speight connects well with all 
three starting receivers — junior 
Grant Perry, sophomore Kekoa 
Crawford and freshman Tarik 
Black. Speight has spread the 
wealth amongst them, as each 
starting wide receiver already 
has a touchdown catch.

Air 
Force’s 
pass 
defense 

allowed 
40 
passing 
yards 

and just six first downs in its 
opening game, but in terms of 
overall ability, VMI obviously 
doesn’t match up with the 
Wolverines. 
The 
Falcons’ 

defensive 
coordinator 
Steve 

Russ emphasizes the importance 
of stopping the run, but has 

said that he likes to disrupt the 
passing game with blitzes fairly 
often.

The more Air Force blitzes, 

the more chances Speight has to 
hit his receivers for big plays. 

 
Edge: Michigan

Michigan run offense vs. 

Air Force run defense

The 
Michigan 
run 
game 

involves a three-man rotation 
— fifth-year senior Ty Isaac, 
sophomore Chris Evans and 
junior 
Karan 
Higdon. 
The 

Wolverines start most drives 
by handing the ball to Isaac. 
Against Cincinnati, he rushed 
for a career-high 133 yards. 
Isaac’s best speed comes when he 
is running to the outside. While 
he doesn’t have a touchdown 
yet, he has established himself 
as the lead runner, and another 
100-yard outing from Isaac is 
very possible.

Evans’ best asset is his speed. 

He hasn’t broken free for any 
major plays so far in 2017, but 
he sets himself apart from Isaac 
and Higdon in the open field.

Higdon has Michigan’s lone 

rushing touchdown, and the 

coaches seem to favor him in the 
red zone. Over the course of the 
season, Higdon may not gain as 
many yards as Isaac or Evans, 
but he will be a key player when 
it comes to hammering the ball 
into the end zone.

Simply 
put, 
Air 
Force 

probably won’t have an answer 
for Michigan’s running backs.

The Falcons lost 11 of their 

top 12 tacklers from last season, 
and much like the Wolverines, 
only 
one 
defensive 
starter 

returned — linebacker Grant 
Ross. Michigan hasn’t displayed 
a prominent run game yet, but if 
Isaac or Evans manages to find 
a gap, they’ll run right through 
Air Force’s rush defense.

Edge: Michigan

Air Force pass offense vs. 

Michigan pass defense

Air Force quarterback Arian 

Worthman has reason to be 
pretty 
nervous. 
Michigan’s 

defense is averaging five sacks a 
game, and they don’t hit lightly. 
Worthman tossed for 172 yards 
and two touchdowns against 
VMI, but he won’t have nearly as 
much time to throw against the 

Wolverines.

Junior safety Tyree Kinnel 

is leading the defense with 15 
tackles, a sack and a pick-six. 
Right behind him is sophomore 
linebacker Devin Bush Jr., who 
has 14 tackles with two sacks.

The 
quarterback 
pressure 

could come from anywhere, 
and it probably will come from 
everywhere. Whether it is from 
linebackers like senior Mike 
McCray and sophomore Khaleke 
Hudson or defensive linemen 
like sophomore Rashan Gary, 
Worthman will not be given 
much time to relax.

On the off chance that he does 

have time to throw, Michigan’s 
secondary 
has 
already 

returned two interceptions for 
touchdowns — so his odds aren’t 
too great there either.

 
Edge: Michigan

Air Force run offense vs. 

Michigan run defense

This breakdown hasn’t been 

very kind to Air Force. However, 
the 
Falcons’ 
run 
offense 

deserves respect. It’s the one 
area they could truly threaten

Behind Enemy Lines

To gain an inside perspective 

on the Michigan football team’s 
upcoming matchup against Air 
Force, the Daily reached out to 
Brent Briggeman — the Falcons 
beat writer for the Colorado 
Springs Gazette.

On 
Wednesday 
night, 
we 

spoke on the phone with Brent 
to discuss Air Force’s triple 
option, Falcons running back 
Tim McVey and what needs 
to happen to put Michigan on 
upset alert.

Here’s 
a 
look 
into 
our 

conversation:

The Michigan Daily: The big 

talk around here is the triple 
option. How do you think it 
could fare against this defensive 
line that Michigan has?

Brent Briggeman: I think it’s 

proven over the years that it can 
work against any defense, you 
know what I mean? It’s so hard 
to stop just because it doesn’t 

matter how big you are. It’s just 
a matter of picking up the ball. 
The deception and quickness in 
it is really difficult for a team 
that doesn’t see it very often. 
Also, it allows Air Force to leave 
a man unblocked on every play, 
and they don’t have to sustain 
blocks very long. That really 
helps them being undersized. 
It 
eliminates 
a 
lot 
of 
the 

disadvantages that come with 
being undersized.

And 
Arion 
Worthman 
at 

quarterback 
is 
the 
fastest 

quarterback I’ve seen operate 
this system. And since he’s been 
in, that’s why they’ve won seven 
in a row. It’s hard to understand 
what that looks like until you’ve 
actually played against it or seen 
it in person. They know where 
they’re going and the defense 
doesn’t, and they get there 
quickly. It’s such a different 
game for defenders to play.

TMD: Along those same lines, 

do you think it’s even further 
of an advantage for Air Force 

that — as talented as Michigan’s 
defense is — they don’t have a lot 
of college snaps?

BB: It sort of puts them at a 

disadvantage I would think. It’s 
just not a natural way to defend. 
Talking to Air Force defenders — 
seniors who have played against 
this in practice for years, and 
then play against New Mexico, 
Army and Navy every year who 
run a variation of the triple 
option — they’re still picking up 
nuances of how to defend it. To 
think that a team could learn it 
over spring practice and then in 
the week leading up — you’re not 
gonna learn it. You’re just gonna 
have to learn enough of it to try 
to get by.

It’s not like Air Force is gonna 

bust 
every 
play. 
Michigan’s 

gonna make plays. But Air 
Force hasn’t been shut out 
in something like 30 years — 
maybe 20 years, it’s been a long 
time — and there’s a reason. It’s 
really hard to stop this. And 
the minds that go into creating 
this offense, you know, (Air 
Force coach) Troy Calhoun was 
an NFL offensive coordinator, 
so it’s not like he only uses 
the triple option. And Mike 
Theissen, who’s the offensive 
coordinator, was an academy 
graduate, played quarterback 
here and was a professor for a 
little while in mathematics. So 
obviously, these are some pretty 
bright minds. It’s not like these 
are guys who just run it because 
they 
don’t 
know 
anything 

else. They run it because they 
understand that it works here. 
And if you’re a defender getting 
your third college start, it’s 
gonna be eye opening.

TMD: Is there any chance 

that Air Force could air it out 
more often than they normally 
would, given that Michigan’s 
secondary hasn’t really been 
tested at all in the air yet?

BB: I would think. I wouldn’t 

expect them to throw more than 
12 to 15 times. They pick their 
spots well, because obviously 
they have to get that ground 
game established. Once guys are 
starting to cheat a little bit … 
suddenly a back is running loose 

Michigan. Here’s why.
The triple-option playbook Air 

Force utilizes is full of trick plays and 
deception. The Wolverines haven’t 
faced an opponent like that this year, 
or any year recently. Against VMI, 
the Falcons’ unconventional system 
managed to run for 473 positive 
yards, had seven different players 
score rushing touchdowns and had 11 
players rush for over 20 yards.

The Wolverines have talked about 

prepping for this scheme since last 
spring, though. Michigan’s defensive 
line should power through the 
Falcons’ front five. When the likes of 
Gary and veteran linemen Maurice 
Hurst and Chase Winovich come 
crashing on the Falcons’ door, the 
triple-option won’t have so much 
flexibility.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

The Wolverines undoubtedly have 

the better talent on special teams, but 
they have yet to prove it. Freshman 
Donovan Peoples-Jones was benched 
as the punt returner because he 
was making risky decisions. His 
replacement, junior Grant Perry, only 
called for fair catches — something 
Peoples-Jones never did.

Michigan 
redshirt 
freshman 

kicker Quinn Nordin had an eye 
for the field goals against Florida, 
hitting four-for-six with two for over 
50 yards. Air Force hasn’t kicked a 
field goal yet this season — it scored 
touchdowns on most of its drives 
against VMI.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

Speight is out to prove himself. 

While he’s not in any danger of losing 
his starting spot, the criticism around 
his two interceptions week one 
and his two fumbles week two has 
been growing. If he cleans up those 
mistakes, Speight could be primed for 
a dominant performance Saturday.

Leading the Wolverines into the 

Big Ten season undefeated, and 
throwing a few more touchdowns in 
the process, would get everyone back 
on Speight’s side.

Edge: Michigan

The Wolverines have the edge in 

every category, but don’t count Air 
Force out with its tricky, fast offense. 
Cincinnati gave Michigan a scare, so 
there is no reason to think the Falcons 
can’t either. On the scoreboard, this 
Saturday could look a lot like the last.

Prediction: Michigan 38, Air 

Force 13

and catches the pass, or one 

of the receivers is in single 
coverage. So yes, they will throw. 
It’s not a trick play for Air Force 
to throw the ball, but because 
the ground game becomes such 
an emphasis for the defense, 
that usually when they do go to 
the air somebody can find a way 
to get open.

TMD: Tim McVey, I feel like 

he might fly under the radar 
given that he goes to Air Force, 
what have you seen out of him? 
I mean the amount of yards 
he has racked up is kind of 
ridiculous.

BB: I mean, he’s Air Force’s 

all-time leader in yards per 
carry, he’s second in yards per 
reception and he’s third in yards 
per kickoff return. He’s been 
the most efficient weapon in 
program history.

It was shocking. When he was 

a sophomore — and he’s only 
5-foot-8, 185 — and he’s putting 

up all these numbers in garbage 
time. … They were impressive 
numbers but it was like, ‘Well 
what’s he gonna do against 
a first-string defense?’ Then 
he got a bigger role and it was 
exactly the same, and it hasn’t 
stopped now for three years. 
He’s got really good vision and 
acceleration, 
and he’s a 4.4-
speed guy. He 
can 
burn 
and 

he understands 
where he needs 
to be, and then 
obviously 
he’s 

in 
an 
offense 

that gives him 
a chance. And 
he’s even more 
effective 
with 

Worthman 
at 
quarterback, 

because Worthman will get 
the option three or four yards 
downfield before a defense has 
to collapse on him, and then he’ll 
flip it out to him. So he’s a very 
explosive player. He doesn’t pass 
the eyeball test. He’s not gonna 
wow you when he gets off the 

bus, but when he gets the ball in 
his hands, he just finds a way to 
make plays.

TMD: Is there any talk of him 

trying to go to the next level?

BB: There’s always talk for 

big time Air Force players, 
especially with last year, when 
the rule changed so they can 

explore 
that 

immediately. … I 
think he’s a guy 
(who will) get in 
an NFL minicamp 
if he can prove 
himself. Two years 
down 
the 
road 

he’ll 
be 
serving 

active duty; maybe 
he’ll get a training 
camp 
invitation 

and see what he 

can do. I don’t know that he has 
the strength to make it to that 
level. If they could use him as 
a third-down guy — because he 
can catch the ball and he can run 
the ball. I think somebody might 
find a spot for him, but there’s 
a good chance he has reached 
his max as a really good college 

player.

TMD: Is there one thing that 

Air Force has to do to pull off 
this upset?

BB: There’s gonna have to be 

some luck involved, and part of 
that is they’re gonna have to get 
to the quarterback at Michigan. 
By and large when they’ve lost 
over the past few years, it’s 
because 
quarterbacks 
have 

picked them apart with the deep 
ball. Air Force does a lot to stop 
the run, and they’re really good 
against the run, and they’re 
pretty good against short passes. 
But because they blitz so much, 
they’re asking their corners to 
do a lot of one-on-one coverage, 
and not many corners are gonna 
win that battle once they’re 
25, 30 yards downfield. If a 
quarterback is accurate enough 
to hit that pass, they don’t stand 
a chance.

They need to get to Speight 

with those blitzes, or they 
need Speight to be inaccurate 
downfield. If those combinations 
hit, then Air Force can stay in 
this game.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Redshirt junior quarterback Wilton Speight could capitalize on a blitz-heavy defense against Air Force on Saturday to rebound from a rough two weeks.

He’s been the 

most efficient 

weapon in 

program history.
