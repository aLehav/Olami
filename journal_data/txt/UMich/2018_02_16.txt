ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Joshua Johnson — host of 

NPR’s “1A” — navigated the 
issue of free speech on college 
campuses, and how to encourage 
free 
dialogue 
while 
also 

maintaining a comfortable and 
safe environment for students, at 
a live taping of his show Thursday 
night. 
The 
panel 
discussion 

“Speak Freely: Debating the 
First Amendment in a Changing 
America” was co-sponsored by 
Michigan Radio and Wallace 
House, a fellowship program for 
journalists at the University of 
Michigan, and drew hundreds of 
people to Rackham Auditorium. 

 Johnson, a journalist for the 

show that focuses on politics, 
policy and technology daily, sat 
down with a panel featuring 
University 
faculty 
members 

Angela Dillard and Faith Sparr, 
who teach in the Departments of 
Afroamerican and African Studies 
and Communications Studies, 
respectively, as well as Rackham 
student Maximillian Alvarez and 

LSA senior Jesse Arm. 

The conversation started with 

the panelists responding to the 
question of how universities 
should respond to controversial 
far-right 
personalities, 
such 

as white supremacist Richard 
Spencer, and whether universities 
are obligated to host these 
speakers. In October, Spencer 
requested 
to 
speak 
at 
the 

University 
without 
invitation, 

and after a lengthy negotiation 
process, the University announced 
in January Spencer would not be 
speaking this semester, though 
they would offer him potential 
dates to speak once the semester 
is over.

Dillard 
acknowledged 
the 

University’s legal obligation of 
protecting free speech, but said 
people must acknowledge “the 
idea that we would have such a 
divisive, potentially dangerous 
person… and how disruptive that 
might be on our campus to the real 
work of our campus.” 

“It is not something that the 

University of Michigan is at one 
mind about,” Dillard said.

LEO demands pay raises and job security, calls University counteroffer “insulting”

After receiving what members 

called an “insulting” response 
to their salary proposal from 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Monday night, the Lecturers’ 
Employee 
Organization 
held 

a 
press 
conference 
at 
the 

Michigan Union prior to the 
University Board of Regents 
meeting 
Thursday. 
Lecturers 

and allies addressed the board 
and University President Mark 

Schlissel directly, emphasizing 
the union’s core demands, which 
include higher wages, enhanced 
job 
security 
and 
improved 

benefits.

More than 75 people, including 

lecturers, allies, students and 
members 
of 
the 
Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization 

gathered in support of LEO, many 
with signs, buttons and T-shirts. 
The press conference featured 
lecturers from the School of 
Social Work and University of 
Michigan-Dearborn, as well as 
LEO President Ian Robinson 

and Heather Ann Thompson, 
professor of Afroamerican and 
African Studies.

Robinson, a sociology lecturer, 

expressed worry at the meeting 
that in light of the University’s 
“shockingly low” offer, the union 
may not be able to conclude 
negotiations before its current 
contract ends on April 20.

“We are not going to get to 

a contract by our goal of early 
April unless the administration 
rethinks the role that we play 
and the respect that we deserve 
and makes a much bigger offer 

in response to our demands,” 
Robinson said. 

LEO, 
which 
represents 

nearly 1,700 non-tenure track 
faculty members across all three 
University campuses, has been 
bargaining for a new contract 
with 
the 
University 
since 

last semester. Right now, the 
minimum salary for a full-time 
lecturer is $34,500 at University 
of Michigan-Ann Arbor, $28,300 
in Dearborn and $27,300 in Flint.

In its counterproposal, the 

University 
offered 
a

Lecturers hold press conference 
to outline frustrations with ‘U’

More 
than 
125 
million 

Americans 
are 
exposed 
to 

dangerous levels of air pollution, 
according to the American Lung 
Association’s 2017 State of the 
Air Report. The environmental 
and health ramifications of air 
pollution are well documented: 
Haze, ozone depletion, acid rain 
and lung cancer are among many 
of the consequences that result. 
But social costs, like increased 
criminal activity, may also result 
from the worsening air quality, 
according to research by a 
University of Michigan professor.

Julia Lee, assistant professor of 

management and organizations 
at the Ross School of Business, 
explored 
the 
correlation 

between 
unethical 
behavior 

and air pollution in a study with 
researchers 
from 
Columbia 

University 
and 
Harvard 

University. The findings, soon to 
be published in the Psychological 
Science journal, demonstrate a 
relationship between the anxiety 
caused by pollution and social 
ills.

Lee first became interested in 

behavioral ethics while earning 
her doctorate degree in Public 
Policy at Harvard. She began to 
look at the relationship between 
air 
pollution 
and 
unethical 

behavior with her former adviser 
Francesca Gino, a professor 
of business administration at 
Harvard Business School.

“We had some initial data from 

FBI and EPA, but realized that 
putting together a large dataset 
and accounting for many possible 
confounds (e.g., demographics, 
# of police officers, etc) may be 
a daunting task, and that’s when 
we decided to team up with 
Jackson Lu and Adam Galinsky 
at Columbia Business School,” 
Lee wrote in an email interview.

Lee 
and 
her 
colleagues 

analyzed 
vast 
datasets, 

combining the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s city-level 

pollution data with the FBI’s city-
level crime data, allowing them 
to analyze 9,360 American cities 
in total.

“Jackson loved talking about 

how comprehensive this dataset 
was by reporting that the data 
had 17 different cities across 
different states that were all 
named ‘Springfield,’” Lee wrote.

Ultimately, the team found 

strong 
correlations 
between 

unethical behavior and pollution, 
and believe anxiety related to 

pollution may be at the heart of 
the issue.

“There is an existing body 

of 
work 
showing 
that 
air 

pollution increases stress and 
anxiety,” Lee wrote. “Francesca 
Gino and I had already done 
some work on how engaging 
in unethical behavior might 
reduce people’s anxiety at least 
temporarily, and demonstrated 
that cheating resulted in the 
reduction in participants’ stress 

When 
Kinesiology 
junior 

Okpalefe 
Edevbie 
transferred 

from Wayne State University to the 
University of Michigan’s School 
of Kinesiology, he was excited to 
learn about a major WSU didn’t 
offer — Sports Management — 
which focuses on the interactions 
of sports and business.” He knew 
there was less diversity at the 
University in comparison to WSU, 
but was surprised at how often 
he felt he was the only minority 
student in his courses, specifically 
in the sport management program.

“In my classes, I’m usually one… 

if not the only minority student in 
a lot of my classes, which I thought 
was 
interesting 
particularly 

in sport management because 
African 
Americans 
influence 

sports and sports culture so much 
in this country,” Edevbie said. 
“But, I thought that there would be 
at least more African Americans 
like myself in the program.”

According 
to 
La’Joya 
Orr, 

managing director for recruitment 
and admissions for the Kinesiology 
School, 
the 
school’s

population is 77 percent white,

On Thursday afternoon, the 

University of Michigan Board of 
Regents met for the first meeting 
of 
the 
semester, 
with 
many 

representatives of the Lecturers’ 
Employee Organization and Stop 
Spencer voicing their concerns 
during public comments. Topics 
discussed 
included 
increasing 

wages and benefits for lecturers, 
#StopSpencer, 
allocation 
of 

funds to several investments and 
renovations, and actions currently 
being taken by the Interfraternity 
Council to create a safer Greek life 
community.

Parkland, Florida.

“Before we get started, I’d like 

to acknowledge in great sadness 
the events in Florida and extend

Performers dance on stage during the CSSA Chinese New Year Celebration Gala at the Michigan Theater

Grand 
Rapids 
community 

leaders Mike and Sue Jandernoa 
are donating $4.3 million to 
expand scholarships at the Ross 
School of Business, contribute to 
fellowships at the Ford School 
of Public Policy and assist the 
University of Michigan School 
of Education’s TeachingWorks 
organization, 
the 
University 

announced Thursday.

The statement said $3 million 

of the couple’s donation would 
be dedicated to a TeachingWorks 
parternship with schools in Grand 
Rapids, with a specific interest in 
improving students’ mathematics 
proficiency. TeachingWorks is 
a national organization based at 
the School of Education, seeking 
to improve entry-level teachers’ 
preparation for the classroom. 
The Jandernoas emphasized the 
importance of the mathematical 
readiness in order to improve the 
number and quality of jobs college 

graduates are offered.

The Jandernoas recognized 

lapses in students’ mathematical 
abilities, specifically in western 
Michigan. 
The 
statement 

referenced 
recent 
results 
of 

Michigan 
Department 
of 

Education testing, which revealed 
troubling data on math proficiency 
in the area. Grand Rapids is 
located in Kent County, where 
proficiency was barely above 40 
percent for third graders, and 
below that marker for eighth 
graders.

“Just at the time when the 

current workforce needs better 
math skills, our high school 
graduates 
have 
significantly 

less math understanding and 
proficiency,” Mike Jandernoa 
said. “We must help these 
students in math now so they 
can have successful jobs in the 
future.”

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind 
the scenes look at one of this week’s stories. This week, 
LSA junior Alexa St. John interviewed Rupert Allman, the 
producer of NPR’s politics show, “1A.”

“One of the most interesting things about interviewing 
Rupert Allman from “1A” is that all of the producers there 
are really cognizant of who their audience currently is and 
who they want their audience to be. It’s interesting because 
a radio show, which traditionally now isn’t necessarily the 
most popular medium for news consumption, they’re really 
working to expand both online and offline, and look into 
different avenues of expanding who their audience currently 
is and making sure that they’re covering all the important 
issues that they want in different ways.“

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
U of M is so well off that, unlike many employers, 

they have seldom demanded concessions, i.e. lower wages 
or benefits, in bargaining. But neither have they been 
eager to pay us better, despite our low rate of pay relative 
to K-12 teachers and community college faculty. In short, 
we’re demanding big changes. Over the last 35 years of 
corporatization, U of M, and public higher ed more 
generally, has drifted a long way from where it ought to 
be. We can’t get back on track without a major course 
correction.“

at one of our nation’s schools,” 
Schlissel said. “If we really 
can’t figure out how to keep our 
children safe, then there really 
isn’t much else that matters.”

Schlissel also spoke on the 

recent wave of sexual assault 
and harassment conversations 
in higher education, Hollywood 
and the general public, an issue 
that has generated great publicity 
surrounding the trials of Larry 
Nassar, a former Michigan State 
University and USA Olympics 
doctor. In addition to Nassar’s 
charges, 
former 
Michigan 

Medicine doctor Mark Hoeltzel 
was recently arrested for child 
pornography 
and 
is 
under 

investigation for sexual relations 
with a patient. Schlissel said the 
University will be taking active 
measures, such as the hiring of 
an outside expert, to improve the 
reporting processes for survivors 
as well as the handling of cases 

reported to the University.

Regent Denise Ilitch (D) 

echoed Schlissel’s sentiments 
and 
urged 
those 
who 

have 
experienced 
assault 

and harassment not to be 
afraid to speak out against 
perpetrators.

“I really want to speak to 

the UM community and say: 
Report, report, report,” Ilitch 
said.

improvement of job security for 
lecturers at the University.

Currently, full-time lecturers 

receive a minimum salary of 
$34,500 at the University of 
Michigan-Ann Arbor, $28,30 at the 
University of Michigan-Dearborn 
and $27,300 at the University of 
Michigan-Flint.

Frustrated with low salaries 

and pay rates for lecturers across 
the University’s campuses, LEO 
has continued to meet with 
University officials since October 
demanding a new contract before 
their current contract ends April 
20. During Thursday’s meeting, 
representatives 
called 
on 
the 

University administration to meet 
the demands of lecturers who fall 
at or below the poverty line.

Tony Hessenthaler, a Lecturer 

I in the Spanish Department, told 
The Daily prior to the meeting that 
he’s currently a father of three, and 
while he enjoys teaching, he doesn’t 
know if his current salary will be 
able to support his family, now with 
a newborn diagnosed with Down 
syndrome.

“For eight months out of the 

year, we are just right above the 
poverty line, which is shameful for 
University of Michigan full-time 
teaching position,” Hessenthaler 

said. “We have a newborn, she’s 
about five months old, and she 
has Down syndrome, which was 
a surprise when she was born. 
Luckily she’s in relatively good 
health, but now thinking long 
term I don’t know if I can make 
this a career. I would like it to be, 
but I don’t know if I can make this 
a long-term career and possibly 
find a way to help support her. 
I’ll be supporting her well into 
adulthood.”

Hessenthaler explained over 

80 percent of Lecturer I’s across 
all three campuses earn less than 
$50,000 a year. According to 
Hessenthaler, many departments 
pay new Lecturer I’s the minimum 
salary, 
giving 
small 
yearly 

increases. In regard to decisions 
from the regents, Hessenthaler 
said LEO wants action, not words.

“We don’t want their pity and 

we don’t want lip service, but we 
would really like their support in 
helping us talk to administration to 
make a big market adjustment for 
what lecturers should be making,” 
Hessenthaler said.

During the current bargaining 

session, Hessenthaler highlighted 
demands from LEO including 
salary increases, the ability for 
departments to use the title 
Teaching Professor instead of 
Lecturer, and a longevity bonus 
for career lecturers who have held 
their positions for extended periods 

and who might remain restricted 
by current contract wages.

“I really hope that with the 

regents’ support, lecturer support, 
tenure-track faculty support and 
student support that we can get 
these wages up to where they 
should be,” Hessenthaler said. 
“We’re not asking for golden 
parachute 
pension 
plans 
and 

health care that covers massages in 
chiropractors, we don’t need that 
stuff. We just need a living wage 
to get by, especially in Ann Arbor 
where the cost of living is relatively 
high to everywhere else in the 
area.”

As reported previously in The 

Daily, the median rent in Ann 
Arbor increased 14 percent from 
2010 to 2015, according to the U.S. 
Census Bureau, and currently sits 
at approximately $1,075 per month.

Katie Oppenheim, chair of the 

University 
Professional 
Nurse 

Council, also spoke on behalf of 
increasing wages and benefits for 
faculty. Oppenheim claimed as 
tuition rates rise, salaries have not 
risen at the same rate.

“Only through the power we 

get from collective bargaining can 
we counteract the markets built-in 
tendency to undervalue us in our 
work,” Oppenheim said. “And I will 
also add the University’s tendency 
to undervalue us in our work.”

Central Student Government 

President Anushka Sarkar, an 

LSA senior, addressed the regents 
during her CSG update. She 
presented the support of student 
governments across the three 
University campuses, highlighting 
all three bodies have passed 
resolutions in support of LEO and 
higher wages for lecturers.

“Student 
Government 

recognizes the vital role that 
lecturers play at the University, 
and call for higher wages, more job 
security, and healthcare coverage 
as conditions in the next contract 
for lecturer employees,” the U-M 
Dearborn Student Government 
Regents Report reads.

Richard Spencer
The topic of the University’s 

potential 
visit 
from 
white 

supremacist 
Richard 
Spencer 

was 
mentioned 
consistently 

throughout the remaining portion 
of the meeting by various students. 
Though the possible visit has been 
delayed until potentially spring or 
summer semester, students were 
concerned for the safety of minority 
students as well as frustrated with 
the administration’s overall lack 
of support for those targeted by 
Spencer’s messages.

LSA senior Darian Razdar is 

currently a member of the Stop 
Spencer Coalition on campus.

After 
brief 
discussion, 
the 

conversation’s focus quickly shifted 
to whether conservative thoughts 
are attacked on campus. Arm is 
the co-chairman of the American 
Enterprise Institute’s Michigan 
Executive Council, a public policy 
think tank responsible for bringing 
controversial 
social 
scientist 

Charles Murray to campus earlier 
this year. Arm stressed how 
professors are given the ability to 
“teach policy as if it’s a matter of 
fact” and said academically, he has 
faced adverse consequences for his 
conservative views. 

“Grade retribution problems 

exist,” he said. 

Continuing, 
Arm 
criticized 

the degree to which professors 
expressed their personal political 
opinions 
in 
the 
classroom, 

especially 
during 
the 
2016 

presidential election. 

“You had University professors 

openly endorsing one candidate … 
in their classrooms and pushing 
their agenda,” Arm said. 

Arm said he thought the 

most effective mechanism in 
combatting controversial speakers 
like Spencer on campus was not by 
denying them a place to speak but 
by not showing up to their event. 

Alvarez refuted Arm’s claim, 

questioning the legitimacy of 
the narrative that conservative 
viewpoints were being attacked 
in the classroom, saying instead 
they were being challenged as 
all ideas should be in a university 
setting, and alluded to the issue of 
conservative victimization. 

“This kind of narrative of 

conservative 
victimization 
is 

actually feeding the very thing 
we are trying to fight against, 
and … gives dangerous people 
a protective blanket to come in 
here with their violent supporters 
under the banner of free speech,” 
he said. 

Alvarez 
continued, 
saying 

Spencer’s 
potential 
presence 

would inevitably attract other 
white 
supremacists 
and 
hate 

groups to campus, creating a 
dangerous environment. 

Johnson 
soon 
sparked 
a 

discussion 
regarding 
Murray’s 

talk at the University in October. 
Murray is a libertarian political 
scientist whose controversial book 
“The Bell Curve”, which draws 

connections between race and 
intelligence, is denounced by many 
other academics as racist. 

Along with AEI, Arm thought 

hosting Murray on campus would 
bring students from both sides 
of the aisle together and begin a 
dialogue. Instead, Arm claimed 
protesters at the event made a 
deliberate effort to shun Murray 
by turning off the lights during his 
speech and projecting the words 
“White Supremacist” on the wall 
behind the speaker. Arm saw the 
events that transpired as evidence 
of the attack on conservative 
views on the University’s campus. 
The day after the event, the New 
York Times published an op-ed 
authored by Arm of his response to 
the protesters. 

Alvarez, who was a leading 

protester at the event, refuted the 
claim that protesters inhibited 
Murray 
from 
expressing 
his 

ideas. However, Alvarez stressed 
while protesters gave Murray 
an opportunity to speak, it was 
important to shed light on the 
absurdity of Murray’s viewpoints. 

“Murray’s pseudo-scholarship 

has been rebutted and defamed for 
decades,” Alvarez said. 

LSA junior Anna Horton later 

said she identified with Arm’s 
struggle to express conservative 
views in the classroom. 

“I can say from a recent 

discussion with a professor that 
our views are not necessarily 
welcomed,” she said.

Anthony Borden, a founding 

member of Progressives at EMU, 
discussed 
his 
concerns 
with 

Spencer and other controversial 
conservative speakers coming to 
speak on campus.

“If you are inciting violence, 

your free speech should not be 
protected,” he said. 

An audience member inquired 

about the intersection — or lack 
thereof — between freedom of 
speech, social media and fake 
news. Johnson mentioned his 
disdain for the phrase “fake news.”

“I hate the term fake news, 

because if it’s fake, it’s not news,” 
Johnson said.

Sparr added that in current 

climate, it is important to be 
cognizant of the media audiences 
consume. 

increase to the starting salary in 
2019, $750 in 2020 and $500 in 
2021. The deal also included a 1.5 
percent annual raise for lecturers 
in Ann Arbor, but not those in 
Dearborn or Flint.

Though the Academic Human 

Resources Office handles the 
collective bargaining process, 
LEO decided to make its case 
before the board as well, who, 
according 
to 
the 
Michigan 

Constitution of 1963, have 
“general supervision” of the 
University and “the control and 

direction of all expenditures 
from the institution’s funds.” 
In an interview with The Daily 
earlier this month, University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said 
the administration was working 
toward securing “a contract 
that is economically fair to the 
lecturers and fiscally responsible 
for the University.”

“The 
University 
has 

approached and prepared for 
this round of negotiations very 
much in the same way it has 
with the other LEO negotiations 
since 2004,” he said, referring to 
the first contract the University 
signed with the union. “This 
includes 
many 
hours 
and 

levels of internal consultation 
with leaders at UM-Dearborn, 
UM-Flint and across the schools 
and colleges on the Ann Arbor.”

According to Robinson, LEO’s 

first contract, which improved 
internal procedures for handling 
employee dismissal and raised 
the minimum salary for entry-
level lecturers, was “a quantum 
leap.”

“It 
was 
a 
major 
change 

compared to where we had been 
before, not only in terms of wages 
and salary, but also in terms of 
job security,” he said. “However, 
after that first contract, I would 
say the University pushed back 
hard and it became difficult for 

us to make much headway.”

At the board meeting, LEO 

members looked to make up 
lost 
ground, 
sharing 
their 

perspectives on the ongoing 
bargaining 
process 
and 

protesting 
what 
they 
said 

are 
stagnating 
wages, while 

allies and students expressed 
solidarity. 
Central 
Student 

Government President Anushka 
Sarkar, an LSA senior, read a 
statement signed by the student 
body presidents from each of the 
University campuses.

“Lecturers deserve to be paid 

a fair living wage, commensurate 
with their experience and the 
revenue lecturers generate for 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

job security and health care 
coverage,” Sarkar said.

In 2016, lecturers accounted 

for $462 million in tuition 
revenue, based on number of 
credit hours taught, while the 
University spent $85 million 
on their salaries and benefits. 
Lecturers 
argued 
the 
$377 

million surplus should be used 
to meet the demands central to 
their bargaining platform.

Unlike 
LEO 
members, 

Thompson is tenure-track faculty 
and currently a Visiting Scholar 
in the Charles Warren Center for 
Studies in American History at 
Harvard University, but she said 

it was important to her to return 
to Ann Arbor to speak on LEO’s 
behalf before the board.

“I think one of the things 

you’ll hear from the University 
administration is that they’re 
paying what the market will 
bear,” she said. “That is, we 
should hire lecturers at the 
lowest price we can get away 
with and treat them as a casual 
and indeed replaceable academic 
labor force. In my opinion, this is 
no way to run a great university 
— to run any university.”

The board did not offer any 

response to the testimony offered 
by LEO members and their 
supporters during the meeting.

5.8 percent Asian American, 3.5 
percent Black/African American, 
4.8 percent Hispanic/Latino, 4.3 
percent multiracial and 4.6 percent 
unknown. The University’s overall 
student population is 65 percent 
white, 15 percent Asian American, 
5 percent Black/African American, 
6 
percent 
Hispanic/Latino, 
1 

percent Native American and 10 
percent unknown.

Edevbie said it took him some 

time to adjust to the predominately 
white community.

“For the first time in a while, 

I was just surrounded by people 
who didn’t necessarily look like me 
or had the same background as me, 
and that was a bit of an adjustment 
for me personally,” Edevbie said.

Edevbie also serves as the 

Central 
Student 
Government 

representative for the Kinesiology 
School. He says he tries to make 
himself as available to Kinesiology 
students as possible and apply 
what he learns from them to his 
work in CSG.

“I take my role in CSG really 

seriously,” Edevbie said. “The fact 
that I’m representing students 
from the University of Michigan 
as a whole but specifically the 
school of Kinesiology, I try to 
make myself as a resource … I try 
to absorb the different experiences 
of my classmates and people in my 
classes because I think it’s also 
important for me to learn about 
and recognize their backgrounds.”

Kinesiology 
junior 
Cydney 

Rogers grew up as an athlete and 
fan of the University’s sports teams. 
She first began studying athletic 
training but switched to health and 
fitness. Since she changed majors, 
it has become harder for her to 
connect with her peers.

“Now that I’m in health and 

fitness, maybe it’s because I 
switched into their major and I 
didn’t get to go through all the 
classes with them when they 
started off as freshmen, but it’s a 
little harder to communicate with 
students,” Rogers said.

Rogers, who is Black, says she 

hasn’t experienced issues with 
professors regarding her race, but 
she feels Kinesiology students do 
not try to reach out to different 
peers.

“Inside and outside of the class, 

students tend to be very cliquey,” 

Rogers said. “I know it’s like a 
young-adult type of thing, but 
they are really cliquey… maybe it’s 
because they vibe with each other 
off of freshman year.”

Other students have also noticed 

friend groups contributing to a 
lack of diversity in the Kinesiology 
School outside of the classroom.

Kinesiology freshman Maya 

Sankaran was inspired to study 
movement science after an ankle 
injury prompted her to receive 
physical therapy. Sankaran is 
biracial — Indian and white — 
and though she has not taken 
many Kinesiology courses yet, 
she has already noticed the lack of 
diversity within the Kinesiology 
community, specifically within the 
Kinesiology professional fraternity 
Phi Epsilon Kappa. 

“When I joined the Kinesiology 

frat… I think that’s when I started 
realizing that … there’s not that 
many people of color,” Sankaran 
said. “That was during one of the 
rushing processes for it. I go up to 
these different people and say hi 
to them and that might have been 
one way it identified in me, because 
I was one of the non-white people 
there. I didn’t look white.”

According to Sankaran, she was 

one of three people of color in her 
20-member pledge class.

Though Sankaran says she 

worries about how her race 
will be measured toward her 
qualifications in the job-searching 
process.

“I think when I meet someone, 

I don’t take into account their race 
or their gender, sex and what they 
might perceive in me because of 
mine,” Sankaran said. “It’s more of 
when our initial interactions begin 
that I’m starting to piece together 
who this person might be and how 
I might present myself. I think 
it might come into place during 
interviews for certain things, like 
if they’re trying to meet a diversity 
quota, that kind of crosses my 
mind. Will they take me just 
because I’m a person of color or if 
I’m a female?”

Some 
Kinesiology 
students 

hope 
to 
use 
their 
degrees 

specifically to address minority 
issues. Kinesiology junior Brianna 
Kennedy 
felt 
drawn 
toward 

athletic training and physical 
therapy as a senior in high school. 
She began a work-study job in the 
Department of Afroamerican and 
African Studies, inspiring her to 
seek a graduate degree in sports 

psychology, where she hopes to 
make the physical and mental 
health of Black women the focus of 
her work.

A 
Black 
woman 
herself, 

Kennedy has endured more than 
one instance of racism while at 
the University. At the beginning 
of this school year, when a man 
was arrested outside the Michigan 
Union 
for 
disorderly 
conduct 

after calling student protesters 
the n-word and getting in a fight 
with one, Kennedy consoled her 
friends who were present. Last 
year, a classmate in an English 
course, who she said was also 
African American, wrote the word 
“monkey” on her paper. She said 
the experience caused her mental 
distress, and she had to skip her 
classes and clinicals to process 
what had occurred.

“I texted my preceptors … I was 

like, ‘I’m really emotional right 
now so I can’t come,’ emailed 
La’Joya (Orr), called my mom, and 
I couldn’t end the day without 
notifying these people, so it was 
just a lot,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy said the classmate 

apologized, but she did not accept 
the apology.

“When I was sitting with my 

academic adviser, she was like, 
‘Well I talked with her and she 
didn’t really mean it that way. She 
just wants to apologize,’ and I was 
like, ‘I don’t want to talk to her 
ever again,’” Kennedy said. “I don’t 
feel the need to accept her apology 
because at 18, 19, 20, you should 
know.”

In addition to advising students 

academically, Orr said she also 
acts as a supporter for students in 
general.

“In terms of discussing campus 

issues, just day-to-day life, whether 
its academic related or not, I find 
that I tend to be that person more 
often than not,” Orr said.

To address the lack of diversity, 

the Kinesiology Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan aims to create 
a more representative and fair 
environment for students, faculty 
and staff.

“Our DEI plan proposes some 

new programs and initiatives 
relative to diversity, equity, and 
inclusion,” the statement, written 
by DEI Director Ketra Armstrong, 
a professor for sport management, 
reads. 

“However, the overall essence 

of the plan is for us to organically 
weave, 
infuse, 
embed, 
and 

integrate a consciousness and 
sensitivity to elements of diversity, 
equity, and inclusion into our 
existing culture — our ways of 
doing (our policies, practices, and 
procedures) and our ways of being 
(our teaching, learning, research, 
and service).”

Orr also recruits prospective 

Kinesiology 
students. 

While she says she strives to 
enhance diversity, be it racial, 
socioeconomic or ethinicity, she 
says changing the makeup of the 
student population is not as easy as 
it may seem.

“The University of Michigan 

doesn’t have any problems getting 
applications from students,” Orr 
said. “So it’s not like you’re trying 
to find people to apply for the sake 
of applying, because we don’t have 
that problem. But you can’t have 
better numbers if students aren’t 
applying or if students are being 
admitted and they don’t see a 
critical mass here. They don’t feel 
comfortable … it’s just not as easy as 
admitting more underrepresented 
students… students also need to 
feel that if they were to attend, 
that they would be in the inclusive 
environment.”

Orr also feels the issue with 

inclusivity has become even more 
prominent 
among 
prospective 

students, as racist incidents on 
campus have begun to pile up and 
become visible issues off campus.

“I usually tend to be on the road 

recruiting when there are issues 
going on on campus,” she said. “It 
pays to be truthful and I’m glad 
that I tend to be forthright with the 
state of campus, because these are 
students who either have siblings 
here or friends here and knew 
what was going on on campus and 
they’re like, ‘How am I going to be 
supported? Tell me why I should 
come.’”

When speaking with students, 

Orr gives advice on how to feel 
more included at the University. 
The one thing she tells them all 
is to seek out and identify allies — 
both those who look like them and 
those who don’t.

Sankaran hopes the Kinesiology 

School can show its students 
all career paths are possible, 
regardless of identity.

“I think it’s important to show 

that these career paths are open 
to 
everyone,” 
Sankaran 
said. 

“There’s no boundaries of who can 
participate in this and who can go 
for the same goals.”

hormone (cortisol). Based on 
these evidence, we predicted that 
air pollution may be related to 
unethical behavior by increasing 
anxiety.”

These 
results 
demonstrate 

costs associated with air pollution 
are 
higher 
than 
previously 

recorded. Public Health junior 
Faith Reynolds hopes research 
on the social ills of pollution can 
motivate behavioral and political 
change.

“We have known for so long 

that human actions and activity 
have harmful effects on our 
environment, but when it comes 
to affecting behavioral patterns 
it becomes more relevant to our 
everyday lives and decisions,” 
she said. “I really hope more 
work is done in this field and that 
it can motivate policymakers 
and especially polluters to make 
serious changes.”

Not 
only 
do 
the 
recent 

findings impact cities, they also 
have implications on university 
campuses. It is possible air 
pollutants 
could 
correlate 
to 

academic dishonesty in the same 
way they do with crime and 
cheating, Lee said.

“We haven’t tested whether 

students tend to cheat more 

on the days that were heavily 
polluted, 
but 
in 
general, 
I 

suspect that the overarching 
psychological mechanism would 
be the same,” she wrote. “I can 
imagine that students who work 
in the environment that is heavily 
polluted may be more prone to 
cheating.”

Previous studies had found 

subjects who asked to look at 
anxiety-inducing 
images 
of 

pollution before completing an 
unrelated task were more likely to 
cheat than other participants.

Deputy 
Assistant 
Dean 

Christine O’Neil handles LSA 
judiciary cases. While intrigued 
by the recent findings on pollution, 
she is already very familiar with 
the correlation between air quality 
and cheating.

“With the connection between 

pollution and anxiety, I don’t find 
it surprising that individuals in 
this study were more likely to 
cheat if exposed to pictures of 
pollution,” she wrote in an email. 
“We see many cases where the 
student didn’t set out to engage 
in academic misconduct but did 
so due to anxiety in the moment. 
While we have little control 
over pollution in the area, there 
are ways we can try to mitigate 
anxiety with students in order 
to reduce instances of academic 
misconduct.”

T

his past week, White 
House Staff Secretary 
Rob 
Porter 
resigned 

after 
a 
scandal 
emerged 

regarding allegations of domestic 
abuse from his two ex-wives. An 
article by The New York Times 
reported Chief of Staff John F. 
Kelly and Joe Hagin, deputy 
chief of staff for operations, 
knew about the accusations 
in late fall. In response to the 
resignation, President Donald 
Trump tweeted, “Peoples (sic) 
 

lives are being shattered and 
destroyed by a mere allegation. 
Some are true and some are false. 
Some are old and some are new. 
There is no recovery for someone 
falsely accused - life and career 
are gone. Is there no such thing 
any longer as Due Process?”

Amid the sentencing of 

Larry Nassar, former USA 
Gymnastics and Michigan State 
University doctor, there will 
be an investigation regarding 
“reports 
and 
accusations 

that Michigan State officials 
and coaches were told of 
Dr. Nassar’s behavior years 
before it became public, yet 
did nothing to stop him from 
treating athletes.” According 
to an article by The New York 
Times, multiple victims shared 
their experiences with trusted 
university officials but were 
ignored or not taken seriously. 
Nassar’s reputation protected 
him from facing accusations 
for years.

If you Google the question 

“who 
knew 
about 
Harvey 

Weinstein?” you will find a few 
pages worth of headlines and 
articles reiterating the claim that 
everyone in the industry knew 
about Weinstein’s behavior, even 
before The New York Times 
broke the story, even before The 
New Yorker published their 
investigation with accounts from 
multiple women. Women in the 
industry used whisper networks 
— 
informal 
communication 

channels used to share stories — 
to warn each other of predators 
who might run in the same 
circles. Actress Jessica Chastain 
tweeted, “I was warned from 
the beginning. The stories were 
everywhere. To deny that is to 

create an environment for it to 
happen again.”

I know that one of these 

things is not like the other. Nassar 
has been sentenced, Weinstein 
resigned from his company’s 
board and has been pushed out of 
the industry. Porter is just facing 
allegations and no investigations 
have been done; we only have the 
word of the women.

There 
is 
an 
interesting 

pattern here. These are just three 
examples of numerous instances 
in which people knew about the 
wrongdoing of reputable men and 
failed to speak out or step up. The 
careers and lives of Weinstein 
and Nassar were prioritized over 
the harm they continued to cause 
while they were left unchecked. 
Porter was given a privileged 
position in the White House 
despite the FBI’s report on his 
abusive background.

From vulnerable young men 

and women in the film industry 
to children hoping for treatment 
for their athletic injuries, the 
victims were supposed to be 
protected, whether by agents, 
coaches or other authorities. 
None 
of 
these 
men 
were 

operating in total secrecy. But 
those who had the knowledge 
and power to intervene did 
nothing; they didn’t even seek 
to impose consequences until 
the accusations became widely 
known. Maybe it was a desire 
to not rock the boat, or denial 
that someone they knew could 
behave in such a way. Maybe it 
was belittling the trauma of the 
survivors of harassment, assault 
and abuse.

Due process hasn’t gone 

anywhere. I don’t intend to 
advocate for the abandonment 
of due process or the notion of 

innocent until proven guilty. But 
I think it’s important to keep in 
mind that the people who are 
victimized by the justice system, 
the ones whose lives and careers 
truly are ruined by falsehoods, 
are not the people the president 
is talking about in his tweet. A 
powerful, white man who held 
a position in the White House 
would not lose everything should 
it come out that the accusations 
are false.

Some people will leap to 

defend men who have been 
accused. But we often don’t 
extend the same benefit of the 
doubt to the victims, often 
(though not always, by any means) 
women, who are speaking up. 
The individual accomplishments 
of the man are considered — his 
job, his success, his charm, etc. — 
are often presented as some sort 
of evidence for why he couldn’t 
possibly have committed the 
crime of which he was accused. 
But while this is happening, the 
accusers are being grouped into 
a cruel category: women who are 
lying, who are exacting revenge, 
who are just looking for attention. 
Speaking up often brings a slew 
of hate. Not speaking up right 
away comes, too, with its own 
problems. If they didn’t come 
forward right away, that’s cause 
for suspicion.

There is no right way to be 

a victim. Accusers are othered; 
speculations are made regarding 
what might motivate someone to 
ruin a man’s life, and the notion 
that they are simply telling the 
truth, hoping for justice or to 
prevent further action, can be 
found near the bottom of the 
list. Who are victims supposed 
to trust, if they are not protected 
by a system put in place to care 
for them, or if they can’t count 
on someone with power and 
knowledge to stand up against 
what is obviously wrong? What 
are victims supposed to do, 
when their names and lives and 
dragged through the mud while 
their abuser is defended in the 
name of due process?

In case of emergency

I 
 

grew up the son of a 
single mother who put 
herself through college 

while raising two kids. I 
vividly remember days as a kid 
when my mother would take 
me with her to college. She 
expected my sister and I to go 
to college when the time came. 
We also knew, however, that 
there wouldn’t be much in the 
way of savings to pay for it. My 
attendance at the University of 
Michigan is, in many ways, made 
possible by a stroke of luck.

From my first days on 

campus as a freshman serving 
on Hall Council, to my time as 
a recruiter for the University 
and the College of Engineering, 
to my work on Central Student 
Government, I get up every 
day with the goal of trying to 
pay forward the many gifts 
I’ve been given in my short 
time here. CSG has built a lot 
of momentum toward a more 
equitable campus for all. This 
coming school year, we must 
pick up the mantle and carry 
on that work. I’ll be fighting 
to earn your vote to become 
the next CSG president so that 
we can continue the important 
mission of promoting justice 
and facilitating success for 
students of all backgrounds.

I’ve seen firsthand both 

CSG’s great potential and its 
shortcomings. When students 
committed to service come 
together 
on 
this 
campus, 

amazing things can happen. 
But a culture of self-interest 
and 
division 
fractures 
the 

fundamental 
trust 
between 

CSG 
and 
students. 
Many 

students confess to me that 
CSG is a non-factor in their 
University experience. While 
some get by just fine without 
it, many others find themselves 
in great need of the advocacy 

and assistance that CSG can 
provide. Our leadership must 
be united to have an impact. 
That’s why I’m running with 
LSA 
Representative 
Charlie 

Bingham, a junior majoring in 
political science and my good 
friend.

Charlie and I are of the 

same mind when it comes to 
the responsibility CSG has 
toward the people it serves. 
My faith in him is ironclad, 
not 
just 
because 
we 
are 

like-minded 
on 
that 
most 

fundamental 
responsibility, 

but because he’s not afraid to 
disagree with me when the 
course of action isn’t clear.

The course of action on 

the issues facing our campus 
is rarely clear. What our 
campaign 
seeks 
to 
do 
is 

foster a discussion about the 
policies we believe are most 
important — a robust, process-
oriented agenda with justice 
for students as our North Star. 
On our campaign’s website 
you can see our platform in its 
entirety. As our school makes 
plans to increase enrollment, 
we must be ready to adapt. Our 
team is ready to get to work 
for the student body, with the 
intent of increasing resources 
for mental and physical well-
being, 
tackling 
academic 

affairs 
such 
as 
textbook 

affordability, 
adopting 

successful Big Ten measures 
to promote student success, 
improving 
government 

relations—including 
expanding voting and housing 
rights—and 
addressing 

issues of sustainability and 
representation that can make 
the campus a better place down 
the road. In the coming weeks, 
we intend to publish several 
policy memos so as to prove 
the talk about our governance 
goes beyond conjecture.

There are some battles 

that will seem unwinnable. 
But for our prosperity and 
for the sake of students yet 
to attend, we are obligated to 
rise to the challenge, to meet 
the problems head-on with a 
mind toward one day solving 
them. It is fruitless to identify 
a problem without attempting

L 

ast 
week, 
in 
an 

unfortunate 
and 

thankfully 
brief 

sequence of events, I found 
myself in the emergency room 
of the Ohio State University 
Wexner Medical Center.

A progressively concerning 

headache brought a halt to my 
weekend visiting a friend, but 
my short and eventful stay 
in the ER that night revealed 
much about the flaws and 
dangers of the current United 
States health care system.

Apart from the anxiety 

caused by my subpar health 
and the surrounding chaos 
of doctors and nurses, I was 
taken aback by an understated 
consequence of the ER—the 
financial burden. Sitting with 
an IV in my arm, a man came up 
to inform me that in addition 
to the hundreds of dollars in 
medical costs my insurance 
plan would cover, I had to pay 
a $150 copay out of pocket for 
my visit.

Fortunate enough to be 

able to cover this expense, I 
did so while keeping in mind 
the 
prospect 
of 
someone 

unable to pay this cost for 
the treatment of the critical 
medical problem they might be 
experiencing. Because of the 
steep costs, emergency rooms 
deter 
countless 
low-income 

patients 
seeking 
immediate 

medical treatment, and those 
who come and cannot pay 
place an additional burden on 
the hospital. Until emergency 
rooms 
and 
hospitals 
make 

health care more affordable, 
they will continue to impose 
stresses on their patients as 
well as the medical service 
providers themselves.

In a 2014 study conducted 

by the Healthcare Cost and 
Utilization 
Project, 
results 

highlighted that low-income 
patients comprised only 34.4 
percent of total ER visits, 
despite the fact that adults who 
fall under the federal poverty 
line are five times more likely 
to report being in fair or 
poor health than those with 
incomes four times higher than 
the poverty line.

This statistic illustrates the 

dangers that high-cost health 
care can have on the well-being 
of those who cannot afford it. 
Poor adults, some of whom 
live in areas without adequate 
nutritional 
and 
medical 

resources, are at a preexisting 
disadvantage when it comes to 
bearing the burden of hospital 
costs. Without the means to 
sustain a healthy lifestyle, 
ER visits would seem more 
prevalent within this group, 
yet the data reveals a general 
inability to pay for these 
medical services.

According 
to 
the 
1986 

Emergency Medical Treatment 
and Active Labor Act, in the 
case of an emergency, neither 
private nor public hospitals 
are allowed to deny care to any 
patient. This presents a moral 
dilemma to any patient who 
does not have health insurance 
to cover the costs: Either 
find another, less effective 
treatment 
to 
a 
potential 

emergency or go to the hospital 
knowing a collection agency 
will hunt you down should you 
not pay.

While the data reveals 

the majority of low-income 
patients choose not to go to 
the ER at all, the hospital 
also bears a large burden 
from those who do come 
and cannot pay, a cost for 
“uncompensated care.”

In fact, even when President 

Barack 
Obama 
passed 
the 

Affordable Care Act in 2010 
to 
provide 
health 
care 
for 

more 
Americans, 
hospitals 

incurred about $40 billion in 
uncompensated 
care 
costs. 

With President Donald Trump’s 
constant attempts to weaken 
the ACA, it follows that the 

uncompensated care costs for 
hospitals will increase as fewer 
people own health insurance.

Ultimately, the consequences 

of a low-income, uninsured 
patient visiting the ER fall across 
a number of parties.

The patient endures the 

stress 
of 
receiving 
medical 

care that is necessary, yet at 
the same time medical care 
that they know will cause long-
term 
financial 
consequences. 

A 2016 study showed that an 
uninsured patient who visits 
the ER doubles their chances of 
filing for bankruptcy in the next 
four years, highlighting that the 
burden on the patient is financial 
as much as it is emotional.

For 
the 
hospital, 

uncompensated care costs can 
lead to pay cuts for employees, 
layoffs and the cutting of 
certain services. But not all of 
these costs fall on the hospital 
—taxpayer money is used to 
support the debt accrued due 
to poor patients, and some 
government 
 
spending 
is 

allocated 
toward 
financing 

this deficit (per the ACA).

Thus, it is evident the 

consequences of high health 
care 
costs 
for 
low-income 

patients who need immediate 
medical care are wide ranging 
and effect more than the 
patients themselves.

And while most hospitals 

cannot turn a patient away 
at the door, most low-income 
patients make their decision 
not to visit the ER far before 
this would present an issue. If 
hospitals continue to charge 
high 
premiums 
for 
basic, 

necessary 
emergency 
care, 

the proportion of low-income 
patients with ill health and 
the burden on hospitals and 
taxpayers will all rise.

Given 
that 
Trump 

wants to dismantle the ACA 
altogether, 
it 
will 
take 
a 

strong and animated defense 
of Obamacare principles to 
ensure that the health care 
system continues to advocate 
for the needs of the poor.

In retrospect, there was 
little that would have predicted 
the enormous reach of MGMT. 
The American duo exploded 
onto the scene in 2007 with 
Oracular 
Spectacular, 
an 
electropop tour de force that 
artists have continued to bite 
from a decade later. Oracular 
paved the way for the cheerful 
indie bands of later years, like 
Grouplove and Passion Pit, and 
that sound influenced a whole 
range of genres. Frank Ocean 
covered them; so did Katy 
Perry.
That debut is still their 
defining album, propelled by 
the popularity of its singles. 
Nearly every millennial will 
recognize 
the 
simple 
bass 
line of “Electric Feel,” the 
dance-party-ready “Kids,” the 
exuberant opening chords on 
“Time to Pretend.” If that was 
your last point of contact with 
the band, their newest, Little 
Dark Age, will surprise with its 
subtler soundscape. The huge 
choruses and high pitched 
vocals of their earlier years 
are absent, replaced by more 
fully formed, impressionistic 
productions. 
They 
sound 
closer to their ’80s electropop 
predecessors — New Order, 
Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode — 
than ever before.

The title track was their first 
single, released back in Oct., 
and it immediately signaled a 
shift. The track starts quietly, 
then builds into a dark march 
of a chorus. There is a clear 
goth lineage here, with distant 
and moody vocals delivering 
statements of hazy disaffection 
like “Breathing in the dark” and 
“I grieve in stereo.” Suddenly 
that Bauhaus cover they did 

back in 2011 makes a lot of 
sense. MGMT have always 
written sad songs; they’ve just 
covered them up with a lot of 
excited synths. On “Little Dark 
Age,” their production matches 
their brooding mood exactly. 
The effect is one of the best 
singles released by the band 
since their debut, and a clear 
stand out on the album. They’re 
not a totally new band — just 
more matured, growing into 
themselves.
In reality, MGMT never 
wanted 
to 
be 
pop. 
They 
were aiming for the more 
experimental 
and 
ambient 
(hell, they have a song called 
“Brian Eno”), but they didn’t 
quite succeed, and so ended 
up with a huge commercial 

success on their hands. They’ve 
thankfully realized that ’80s 
revival is more their game. You 
can hear this on the opener, 
“She Works Out Too Much,” a 
slightly creepy track about a 
couple obsessed with working 
out on which the band literally 
welcomes us to the “shitshow” 
in 
verse 
two 
— 
“Grab 
a 
comfortable seat,” they add.
It’s not all gloom. “Me and 
Michael” is a flirty track about 
friendship 
so 
powerful 
it 
reaches the romantic, and with 
its driving bass, pretty synth 
lines and ecstatic chorus, it’s 
one of the most addicting on the 
album, and a clear reference to 
their synth-pop influencers. 
It would be quite at home on a 
Walkman.
There are moments on this 
album which become tiring, 
and it can be a bit repetitive. 
By “James,” there’s a sense that 
a different sound is needed to 
cleanse the palette, but they 
don’t reach that sound until 
the closer, “Hand It Over,” a 
slow-moving love song that 
recalls Tame Impala in their 
more pensive moments. On the 
flip side, they’ve created one of 
their most cohesive works in 
probably a decade. That synth-
pop is currently having a huge 
resurgence means that MGMT 
are once again at the right place 
at the right time. And all the 
while, they’re still just doing 
them.

MGMT refines its sound

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

 The late 2010s could appro-
priately be called, “The Age 
of A24,” with major critical 
acclaim following releases 
such as “The Lobster,” “Moon-
light,” “Room” and “Lady 
Bird.” With the new trailer for 
one of the company’s first 2018 
releases, “Hereditary,” it seems 
like the indie studio has no 
plans of slowing down.
 One achievement is the 
trailer’s ability to convey just 
enough about the film’s plot to 
intrigue without giving any-
thing away. Viewers finish the 
trailer with a gist of what the 
film is about — a creepy family 
dealing with some less-than-
ideal common behaviors — but 
don’t have quite enough infor-
mation to figure out how the 

film will play out.
 Scored to sparse, dissonant 
strings and ominous plucking 
sounds, the trailer does a tre-
mendous job of unsettling the 

viewer from the start and, for 
the rest of the runtime, draw-
ing that tension to an unbear-
ably chilling head. One of the 
most jarring elements of the 
trailer is the suddenness with 
which everything seems to be 
happening, seeing a shot of a 
house in the daytime suddenly 
pop into nighttime.
 Perhaps the only concern 

that arises from the trailer for 
“Hereditary” is the possibility 
that it won’t be representa-
tive of the tone and pace of 
the film. The trailer for 2016’s 
“The Witch” comes to mind 
as an example of a trailer that 
portrayed the film as a terrify-
ing thrill ride rather than the 
slow-burn atmospheric chiller 
it ended up being. “The Witch” 
was still a great film, although 
the disconnect between the 
film audiences was advertised 
and the film audiences saw 
likely hurt its overall recep-
tion. The trailer for “Heredi-
tary” looks as if it could hit 
similar beats.

The issue of sexual assault 
in 
the 
workplace 
— 
and 
Hollywood specifically — feels 
kaleidoscopic. By the time you 
write about an aspect of it, 
everyone’s focus has shifted 
onto another angle. Another 
scandal has suddenly aired, 
and you have to update your 
argument 
and 
stretch 
your 
perspective to make it elastic 
enough to encompass all that you 
want to say. It feels paradoxical: 
Write about all of it, and you risk 
sounding hopeless and banal, 
offering nothing with nuance 
or originality. Write about only 
one part, and you risk sounding 
reductive.
This is not a column about 
the trajectory of the #MeToo 
movement and the backlash 
against 
it 
as 
a 
whole; 
I 
haven’t quite mapped out the 
constellation I want to trace 
there yet. This is a column about 
the difference between reading 
minds 
and 
turning 
down 
mashed potatoes politely at your 
aunt’s house.
On 
Jan. 
14th, 
Babe.net 
published a story about an 
anonymous woman’s date and 
subsequent sexual encounter 
with actor Aziz Ansari in Sept. 
“Grace” felt that upon making it 
back to his TriBeCa apartment 
after their weird date, Ansari 
repeatedly ignored her verbal 
and non-verbal cues that she 
was 
highly 
uncomfortable 
and wanted him to stop his 
behavior. She felt coerced and 
violated, and told him so over 
text afterwards, telling him to 
be more mindful in the future. 
He apologized but indicated 
he felt everything was fun and 
consensual. His outspoken and 
lauded support of the #MeToo 
and Time’s Up movements made 
Grace want to tell her story.
Was it assault? Or bad sex?
This is the question that 
preoccupied 
and 
obsessed 
every conservative pop culture 
pundit, every feminist and anti-
feminist in the blogosphere, 
academics 
and 
TV 
critics 
alike. 
The 
website 
Jezebel 
published a rejoinder titled 
“Babe, What are you Doing?” 
noting that “a side effect of the 
tidal wave of sexual assault and 
harassment 
reporting 
since 
Oct. is that, having been long 
confined to explicitly feminist 
outlets, reporting about sexual 
impropriety is, all of a sudden, 
considered 
general-interest 
prestige reporting.” Jezebel was 
cynical about the fact that Babe 
had approached Grace rather 
than the other way around, 
and condemned some of the 
amateurish mistakes of the 

inexperienced writer.
Babe majorly screwed up the 
execution and writing of this 
story. But regrettable as this 
may be, what is almost worse 
is how the botching of this 
story bolstered one of the most 

insidious false arguments that 
people who defend the men in 
stories like this one fall back on: 
That we can’t expect or assume 
men to be mind-readers.
Caitlin Flanagan dubbed the 
Babe article “revenge porn,” 
writing that the anonymous 
woman and the author of the 

article “may have destroyed 
Ansari’s career, which is now 
the punishment for every kind 
of male sexual misconduct, 
from the grotesque to the 
disappointing.” On Jan. 15th, 
Bari Weiss wrote an op-ed titled 
“Aziz Ansari is Guilty. Of Not 
Being a Mindreader.” Each of 
these arguments are built on 
pillars that aren’t as concrete 
as their authors clearly believe 
them to be, but that’s another 
story — though for what it’s 
worth, I think Jezebel’s article 
is highly worth reading for how 
it points out flaws in Flanagan’s 
argument alone.
Many, like Tucker Carlson 
and Ben Shapiro, argue that the 
#MeToo movement is reaching 
too far; that yes, sexual assault 
is bad, but innocent men are 
being dragged under for small 
actions or not being able to 
easily pick up on every clue. To 
them, it is a wildfire spreading 
out of control. The assumption 
that men should always be able 
to pick up on clues is expecting 
too much. They are sympathetic 
to the plight of single (well, not 
always) men in this day and age: 
The conflation of misreading 
mixed signals and rape is 
striking fear into the hearts of 
all our warm-blooded American 
males.
Part of what is so discomfiting 
about stories like Ansari’s — 
and Louis C.K.’s, incidentally 
— is some of these guys have 
crafted personas as men who 
can understand and articulate 
the nuanced ways in which men 
diminish and dismiss women. 
Their comedy often depends 
on it. Until these stories come 
out, they’re praised for their 
awareness. If they can build 
reputations, make money and 
garner praise from being able 
to pick up on subtle cues — how 
can they be missing signals in 
their own real life?
In 1999, Celia Kitzinger and 
Hannah Frith (of Loughborough 
University and University of 
the West of England) wrote an 
article titled “Just say no? The 
use of conversation analysis 
in 
developing 
a 
feminist 
perspective on sexual refusal.” 
In it, they argue that refusals 
in general — not just those 
centered around sex — are 
often complex conversational 
interactions. In other words, 
we are constantly in situations 
in which we prefer to say no 
rather than yes: turning down 
an invitation to a party where 
we know we won’t have fun, 
passing on a lunch date with 
a coworker we abhor, turning 
down a second serving of your 
lovely aunt’s horrible mashed 
potatoes. We say things like, 
“Oh I would, but I don’t know 
many people there,” or “I’ve got 
a lot of work to do, how about in 
a few weeks?” or “Thanks, Aunt 
Margaret, but I’m trying to cut 
down on carbs.” For the most 
part, we all understand how a 
polite or evasive refusal works. 
We give and get them all the 
time.
The point of this article, in 
1999, was that it should not 
be necessary for a woman to 

explicitly say “no” in order 
for their refusal of a sex act 
to be understood. The focus 
on “just say no” implied that 
other forms of refusal were 
open to reasonable doubt, a 
weakness that was and has been 
exploited 
historically 
inside 
and outside of the courtroom 
in the dissmissal of women’s 
testimonies about assault and 
rape. They argued that the focus 
on rape prevention shouldn’t 
be so centered on refusal skills 
or assertiveness training. (This 
is a vast oversimplification of a 
tightly written 24 pages full of 
comprehensive research, but a 
full pdf of it is available online).
While tactics like “just say 
no” have since evolved into 
mantras such as “yes means 
yes,” (many of which have 
culminated in the kind of 
university affirmative consent 
policies that are ridiculously 
impossible to enforce), the point 
still stands: The expectation 
that men should be able to 
pick up on obvious indicators 
of discomfort — verbal or 
nonverbal — is not going too far. 
It’s an attempt to demystify the 
boundaries of consent that seem 

to be bewilderingly murky to so 
many men in this area alone. 
It would be foolish to think, 
by the way, that the horror 
over expecting men to pick up 
on — and then acknowledge 
and react accordingly — to 
cues of discomfort has nothing 
to do with the rich history 
of 
the 
sexualization 
and 
romanticization of the explicit 
lack of consent seen in the films 
and TV shows we voraciously 
consume as a nation. How 
many film scenes can you think 
of where a woman is yelling 
at a man, who then stops 
her by grabbing and kissing 
her? How many times does 
she then melt into his arms? 
(Though vaguely outdated now, 
I recommend a documentary 
called “Miss Representation,” 
a 2011 Sundance Film Festival 
Official Selection that captures 
how attitudes in the media 
filters into and shapes our 
collective 
consciousness). 
Besides, we understand hints, 
suggestions and evasive ways 
of communicating when they’re 
meant to signify interest, rather 
than a lack thereof: When 
someone says I love you without 
actually saying “I love you.” “If 
you’re a bird, I’m a bird.” (“The 
Notebook”). “As you wish.” 
(“The Princess Bride”). You get 
the point.
Perhaps the most visceral 
image in Grace’s story is a 
description of one of Ansari’s 
repeated moves: sticking his 
fingers into her mouth. If you 
are in that close proximity to 
another person’s body — so 
intimately involved with them 
— and you are unable to tell 
they 
aren’t 
enthusiastically 
into it, you shouldn’t be having 
sex. So for the people who will 
read this (and pieces like this) 
and still protest about innocent 
men 
misreading 
signals 
— 
chances are, if you’re really that 
fantastically awful at reading 
body language, you’re probably 
not great in bed anyway.

The American duo’s latest release marks a subtle resurgence


I was a huge band nerd in 
high school. I spent my summers 
going to band camps, playing in 
wind ensembles, learning about 
the repertoire, playing under 
various conductors and just 
enjoying the music. I’ve been 
playing in wind ensemble for the 
past 10 years of my life, and it’s 
a type of ensemble that I truly 
believe is underappreciated.
Largely 
overshadowed 
by 
orchestras, I think that — unless 
someone ever played in a wind 
ensemble at some point — people 

wouldn’t be able to tell you much 
about what they are. Because 
their origins stemmed from 
early marching bands, wind 
ensembles didn’t gain legitimacy 
until the second half of the 
20th century, and even then, 
they were viewed as an inferior 
orchestra.
But if there’s any place to 
experience a wind ensemble, it’s 
at the University. The Midwest 
has a tradition of great band 
programs, and it’s largely thanks 
to our obsession with football.
Where 
there’s 
a 
football, 
there’s a marching band.
Midwestern 
schools 
like 
the University, Michigan State 

University, Illinois and Iowa 
have long-lasting legacies of 
great band and wind ensemble 
programs 
because 
of 
this 
emphasis on football. Because 
football became so popular, 
schools started to put more 
funding into band programs, 
which helped to promote the 
inclusion of wind ensembles in 
many music schools across the 
Midwest.
The 
University’s 
band 
program, 
in 
particular, 
is 
particularly 
well-known

of 
its

I’ve never seen the Detroit 
Opera House as lively as it was 
last Saturday night. It was the 
second day of the largest snowfall 
of the winter season, and, while 
waiting in line outside the Opera 
House entrance, I could sense 
the solidarity that the weather 
had created. Some guests stood 
shivering in short miniskirts and 
pencil heels, others had given 
up and worn their bulky snow 
boots, but we had all braced the 
outdoors and made it here. After 
trudging through slush and 
unplowed sidewalks, we were all 
ready.
From Feb. 8 to Feb. 11, the 
American Ballet Theatre came 
to Detroit to perform one of the 
most classic love stories of all 
time: 
Shakespeare’s 
“Romeo 
and Juliet.” The 1938 ballet, 
composed by Sergei Prokofiev 
is a classic in its own right, 
and these shows demonstrate 
its 
timeliness. 
They 
were 
co-sponsored by the University 
Musical Society, accompanied 
by the Michigan Opera Theatre 
Orchestra and conducted by 
Charles Barker. For Saturday 
night’s show, Romeo was played 
by David Hallberg, a principal 
dancer with the ABT since 2006, 
and Juliet was played by Isabella 
Boylston, principal since 2014. 
Principal dancers for the other 
showings 
included 
Misty 
Copeland, Herman Cornejo, Hee 
Seo, Cory Stearns, Stella Abrera 
and James Whiteside.
So much of Shakespeare’s 
genius lies in his dialogues, 
and I was worried about how a 
ballet with no speaking would 
be able to represent this. I had 
never been so wrong. Whatever 
Kenneth MacMillan’s rendition 
of “Romeo and Juliet” lacked in 
dialogue, it made up for in raw, 
heartbreaking emotion.
The 
contrast 
in 
Romeo 
and 
Juliet’s 
personalities 
was apparent 10 minutes into 
the 
three-hour 
production. 
Boylston, as Juliet, gracefully 
leaped across the stage in a baby 
blue dress, playing pranks on her 
beloved Nurse, played by Nancy 

Raffa. At one point, Boylston 
jumped right into the Nurse’s 
lap, soliciting laughs from the 
audience. Sitting there, with her 
arms wrapped around the Nurse 
and her feet curled under her 
thighs, Boylston was the perfect 
picture of childlike innocence. 
She hadn’t met Romeo yet, thus 
her life was untainted with 
messy love affairs and broken 
hearts.
The moment that Romeo and 
Juliet met each other was the 
moment that I realized how 
wonderful this production was 

about to be. When Hallberg 
laid his eyes on Boylston for the 
first time, he just stared. The 
stage was full of whipping skirts 
and laughter, but the section 
of the stage that Hallberg and 
Boylston occupied was frozen in 
time. Hallberg was awestruck; 
it seemed as if every limb of his 
body was focused on Boylston. 
Boylston’s 
naivety 
suddenly 
disappeared, and she adopted 
a sense of beautiful dignity 
instead. For a full thirty seconds, 
I couldn’t tear my eyes away 
from the couple. Finally, they 
both realized that their love 
was forbidden. After dancing 
tentatively with each other, 

Hallberg and Boylston parted 
with a sense of unfinished 
business.
Every subsequent time that 
Hallberg and Boylston met, 
varying emotions were reflected 
through their dancing. After 
meeting at the ball for the second 
time, Hallberg and Boylston 
embarked on a passionate and 
slow dance, each reveling in each 
other’s bodies and movements. 
Both afraid of being caught by 
their families, their dance was 
filled with haste and passion, 
like they wanted to squeeze out 
their last moments together 
before time ran out. In the 
famous balcony scene, Boylston 
and Hallberg’s slow movements 
dripped with romance and love. 
Boylston held her arabesques 
for what seemed like minutes at 
a time, letting the audience soak 
in her form and grace. When 
Romeo realized that he would be 
banished from Verona, Boylston 
and Hallberg’s dance was filled 
with sorrow and longing for a 
better fate.
All 
this 
built-up 
emotion 
crescendoed beautifully in the 
final scene of the play. Romeo, 
upon seeing Juliet’s body and 
thinking she was dead, stopped 
moving. Hallberg’s face worked 
with emotion and his limbs 
froze. The audience could sense 
his helplessness and desperation 
at 
seeing 
his 
lover 
dead 
without warning. He rushed to 
Boylston’s body, held her in his 
arms and faced the audience 
head-on. It felt like the audience 
wanted to call out to Hallberg 
and help him; his pain seemed 
unbearable.
After 
Romeo 
committed 
suicide, 
Juliet 
awoke 
from 
her slumber and saw Romeo’s 
lifeless body beside her. Sitting 
on the crypt in a pale pink slip, 
aghast that she could have 
caused this, Boylston was the 
picture of vulnerability. This 
one scene perfectly captured the 
whole production. Brimming 
with sentiment, sorrow and 
love, the ABT sprinkled more 
emotion into a play that was 
already heartbreaking to begin 
with. “Romeo and Juliet” was 
ravishing for the eyes and even 
more touching for the heart.

Concert band continues 
wind ensemble tradition

marching bands in the musical 
environment of the University. 
And the University’s Concert 
Band 
continues 
this 
legacy 
today.
In their most recent concert, 
titled 
“Inspirations,” 
the 
ensemble played pieces from 
a variety of composers, with 
works written over the past 
80 years. A lot of these pieces 
were standards in the wind 
ensemble 
repertoire, 
like 
Morten Lauridsen’s “O magnum 
mysterium” 
and 
Leonard 
Bernstein’s 
“Overture 
to 
Candide.” However, pieces like 
“Shoutout” by the University’s 
own Roshanne Etezady and 
“Fever” 
from 
“Lost 
Vegas” 
by another School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance Professor, 
Michael Daugherty, showed off 
works that will soon join the 
ranks of these classic, revered 
wind ensemble pieces.
I was familiar with a lot of 
the music on the program, and 
even have had opportunities 
to see and play some of these 
pieces in high school. But I had 
never heard these pieces played 
so cleanly and so expressively. 
One of the last pieces I played in 
high school was “English Folk 

Song Suite” by Ralph Vaughn 
Williams, and it was also one 
of my least favorite pieces I 
had ever played. Every time we 
rehearsed that piece, I wanted 
to get up and leave. However, 
when 
the 
ensemble 
started 
with the opening theme to the 
march, I couldn’t help but hum 
along. It was just played in a 
way that engulfed me into the 
performance. Every rhythm was 
carried throughout the hall with 
style. The dynamic range was 
huge; I felt like I had to lean in to 
hear their quietest pianissimo. 
The group brought new life to a 
piece that was essentially dead 
to me.
It was also nice to hear some 
Bernstein on the program, the 
ensemble no doubt celebrating 
the centenary of his birth. 
However, 
while 
there 
were 
many prolific composers from 
the past in attendance, two of 
the composers on the program 
were 
actually 
University 
professors who attended the 
concert. After their pieces were 
performed, 
both 
Roshanne 
Etezady and Michael Daugherty 
were invited to take a bow with 
the ensemble after their pieces 
were performed.

Etezady’s 
piece, 
while 
short, was filled with opposing 
rhythms and tonalities that 
seemed to capture my attention 
for what seemed like much 
longer than the three minutes 
the piece lasted. Daugherty’s 
piece felt explicitly modern, 
featuring both the saxophone 
and trumpet sections (as well as 
several other sections) to create 
a soundscape that captured 
the excitement and jazz of the 
Las Vegas strip. I couldn’t help 
but smile when the saxophone 
section stood up in the middle of 
the piece and shredded through 
a technically demanding soli.
With all of these contrasting 
styles, it did seem a bit hard for 
me to adjust my ears to some 
of the more drastic changes, 
but I think the program order 
made sense, and I appreciated 
the ideas director Courtney 
Snyder had, both in regards to 
programming and conducting.
After playing in this ensemble 
for the past three semesters, it 
was an exciting experience to 
see it from the other side of the 
stage. With “Inspirations,” the 
University’s concert band shows 
that the wind ensemble is alive 
and well in the music world.

Report: ‘M’ adding coach

Jim Harbaugh is closing in on 

a 10th assistant for Michigan’s 
coaching staff.

As reported by The Michigan 

Insider’s 
Sam 
Webb 
and 

FootballScoop, former Florida head 
coach Jim McElwain is expected to 
join the Michigan coaching staff, 
replacing Dan Enos, who left for 
Alabama shortly after being hired 
by Harbaugh.

McElwain and Florida parted 

ways on Oct. 30 this past season 
after the coach claimed that his 
family and players had received 
death threats; the University could 
not verify McElwain’s claims and 
sought to terminate him with 
cause.

In three seasons coaching the 

Gators, McElwain compiled a 22-12 
record, including two SEC East 
titles in his first two years. Before 
his firing, Florida had a 3-4 record 
— including a season-opening 
33-17 loss to Michigan on Sept. 2 in 
Arlington, Tex.

That wasn’t the only time 

McElwain 
came 
up 
against 

Michigan during his tenure in 
Gainesville.

The Gators lost, 41-7, to the 

Wolverines in the 2016 Citrus 
Bowl at the end of Harbaugh’s first 
season coaching Michigan.

McElwain’s 
hiring 
would 

fill Michigan’s coaching staff to 
capacity. Earlier this offseason, the 
Wolverines hired Sherrone Moore 
to coach the tight ends and Al 
Washington to coach linebackers.

“We’re thrilled with the new 

additions,” Harbaugh said on Feb. 7. 
“Sherrone Moore, Al Washington, I 
think they’re fantastic.”

A longtime assistant coach 

on the offensive side of the 
ball, McElwain has significant 
experience coaching quarterbacks 
and wide receivers.

After a four-year career at 

Eastern Washington, McElwain 
stuck 
around 
as 
a 
graduate 

assistant between 1985-86, before 
taking over as the quarterbacks 
and receivers coach between 1987-
1994. His next stop was at Montana 
State, where he added play-calling 
responsibilities.

McElwain does have some 

experience 
coaching 
in 
the 

midwest. After a three-year stint at 
Louisville under John L. Smith, he 
followed Smith to Michigan State, 
where he served as assistant head 
coach and oversaw the receivers 
and special teams unit.

After brief stops with the 

Oakland 
Raiders 
and 
Fresno 

State, McElwain was hired by 
Nick Saban to call plays and coach 
the quarterbacks at Alabama. He 
stayed there for four seasons; in 
that span, the Crimson Tide won 
two 
national 
championships. 

McElwain’s offenses finished 25th, 
14th, 2nd and 20th, respectively, 
according to the S&P+ Ratings, 
which take into account efficiency, 
explosiveness, field position and 
ability to finish drives, all of which 
are adjusted for a team’s schedule.

McElwain got his first job as 

a head coach at Colorado State 
shortly after Alabama won the 2011-
12 BCS National Championship. 
With the Rams, McElwain tallied 
a 22-16 record, improving the 
team’s record from 4-8 to 8-6 and 
then 10-3 in his final season. In 
December of 2014, he took the head 
coaching job at Florida.

Given the current composition 

of the staff, it appears likely 
McElwain will coach the receivers, 
the role Enos was set to take on.

This position group, along with 

Michigan’s passing attack as a 
whole, struggled often last season. 
Senior Grant Perry led the team 
with just 25 receptions for 307 
yards, while freshman Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
and 
sophomore 

Kekoa Crawford were close behind 
with 22 catches for 277 yards and 17 
catches for 243 yards, respectively. 
The Wolverines lost freshman 
Tarik Black, one of their starters, to 
a foot injury just three weeks into 
the season.

Harbaugh said on National 

Signing Day that he’s currently 
working to improve Michigan’s 
offense, which finished among the 
nation’s worst in scoring, passing 
yardage and sacks allowed.

“On offense right now, we are 

going through a self-scout period,” 
Harbaugh said, “and looking at 
ways to get our offense up to where 
our defense is.”

Film study: What to expect from Shea Patterson

The sky fell in for the Michigan 

football team at quarterback last 
season. When Shea Patterson 
announced he would transfer 
to the Wolverines, it was lifted 
back up and then some. Think 
Falcon Heavy, if you need a point 
of comparison.

It’s not hard to figure out why.
Wilton Speight, John O’Korn 

and Brandon Peters, all of whom 
started under center at various 
points last season, combined to 
average a pitiful 5.65 adjusted 
yards per attempt. That would 
have ranked 88th in the country 
and ninth in the Big Ten among 
qualified field generals. To put it 
generously, there was room for 
improvement — and Patterson 
seems ready to fill the void.

Though he played just seven 

games thanks to a torn PCL, 
Patterson 
threw 
for 
2,259 

passing yards with the Rebels 
as a sophomore last season. 
Michigan’s 
quarterbacks 

combined for 2,225 in 13 games. 
If Patterson is able to play next 
season — he could be deemed 
ineligible for 2018 as a transfer, 
but the NCAA is expected to 
grant him eligibility due to the 
situation in Oxford — he’s an 
instant upgrade, to say the least.

He is not a savior.
On tape, there are no shortage 

of kinks in Patterson’s game. His 
ball placement and footwork 
especially need refining. Though 
Patterson 
completed 
well 

over 60 percent of his passes 
last season, he frequently left 
yardage on the table by forcing 
receivers to adjust to the ball 
and slow their routes. Even on 
short and intermediate throws, 
Patterson 
had 
a 
worrisome 

tendency to put it high, not 
only preventing receivers from 
picking up yardage after the 
catch, but risking turnovers.

Three 
of 
Patterson’s 

interceptions last season came on 
slant routes where his accuracy 
was just slightly off. All three 
were still within the receiver’s 
catch radius, but forced them to 
adjust. That means the ball in the 
defensive back’s catch radius as 

well — especially if it goes off the 
receiver’s hands. Eliminating 
those few inches of chance is 
vital to Patterson’s development.

Patterson’s footwork is the 

biggest issue in his game. When 
his feet are set and he throws 
from a good base, Patterson 
looks like a future top NFL draft 
pick. However, he doesn’t do 
so with consistency. Especially 
against 
pressure, 
Patterson’s 

footwork tends to lapse. Throw 
a blitz at him and suddenly, 
Patterson’s feet are both facing 
forward. Once that happens, he 
rarely resets, making it hard to 
get an accurate throw off.

To his credit, Patterson is 

better at creating offense in 
those situations than most. He 
can make throws on the run 
and create highlights in doing 
so. But a lot of the time, he can 
be aimless, rolling out with 
his eyes down and without a 
plan in mind. When Patterson 
spots open receivers in those 
situations, he can make the 
throw, but he often doesn’t.

Against pressure, Patterson’s 

footwork and mechanics both 
fall apart. He doesn’t reset his 
feet and often throws off his 
back foot when the pocket is 
collapsing, leading to turnovers.

Blame Ole Miss’ offensive 

line for giving up pressure if you 
want, but Michigan’s isn’t exactly 
made up of world beaters. Pass 
protection was a constant issue 

for the Wolverines last season 
and they’re losing left tackle 
Mason Cole, their most reliable 
starter, along with center Patrick 
Kugler. Rice offensive tackle 
Calvin Anderson may transfer, 
bringing help, but that won’t fix 
everything, nor is it guaranteed 
to happen at all.

The 
potential 
for 
an 

adjustment period shouldn’t be 
underestimated either. Patterson 
played nearly every snap in 
shotgun last season in a spread 
offense, armed to the gills with 
run-pass options and zone reads. 
At Michigan, he’ll be in a pro-
style offense, taking snaps under 
center with traditional three 
and five-step drops. There may 
be some spread elements worked 
in, but this is a wholly different 
system and perfecting it won’t 
be easy — especially given the 
Wolverines’ potential to struggle 
in pass protection.

Part of that will be learning 

to 
audible, 
set 
protections 

and make checks at the line of 
scrimmage. 
Patterson 
wasn’t 

responsible for doing so with the 
Rebels, but there were numerous 
instances where they failed to 
make an obvious call at the line.

On a 4th-and-5 in the middle 

of the third quarter during a 
blowout loss against Alabama, 
the Crimson Tide had just two 
defensive 
backs 
over 
three 

receivers on the trips side of 
a formation with the ball on 

Alabama’s 31-yard line. Instead 
of taking advantage of the 
numbers with a screen or quick 
curl, the inside receivers both 
ran in-breaking routes, towards 
the rest of the defense. That 
failure was on the coaching 
staff, but next season, it will 
be Patterson’s job to make 
the adjustment at the line of 
scrimmage.

All that being said, Patterson’s 

upside is scintillating. He can 
create offense by himself, both 
in and out of the pocket. Though 
his velocity isn’t great, Patterson 
has 
significantly 
more 
arm 

talent than any of Michigan’s 
other options. He can rainbow 
the ball deep so accurately the 
receiver never has to break 
stride, the type of play that five 
quarterbacks in the country are 
capable of making on a good day.

Though his placement needs 

work, Patterson can also hit 
short and intermediate routes 
with 
consistency, 
especially 

when his feet are set. If that 
was his only selling point, the 
Wolverines would happily take 
it after last season. He can keep 
an offense moving — toss in 
a run game centered around 
rising senior Karan Higdon and 
Michigan’s offensive ceiling is 
pretty high.

Patterson isn’t the answer — 

not in the grand, all-being sense. 
But he’s a pretty good start on 
the road to finding one.

‘M’ set to clash against top-ranked Notre Dame 

One more Big Ten series 

against the top-ranked team in 
the nation.

One win, and the Wolverines 

can 
confidently 
say 
they 

punched their ticket to the 
NCAA Tournament.

“We want home ice in the 

playoffs. I think we’re finishing 
sixth in the conference, so we’ve 
got something to prove and 
we’ve got two games left to prove 
it,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “And we’ll be ready. 
And I know Notre Dame will 
be ready, but we had two good 
games with them and we’ll look 
forward to it.”

It’s almost like the final scenes 

of the movie Miracle, in which 
the U.S. national team had the 
chance to avenge an early loss to 
a dominant Soviet hockey team 
on the biggest stage imaginable.

The atmosphere in Compton 

Family Ice Arena may not feel 
like the whole world is watching, 
but for the Wolverines and 
Fighting Irish, this last Big 
Ten series draws some stark 
comparisons with the backdrop 
of the ‘Miracle on Ice.’

The No. 18 Michigan hockey 

team (9-10-3 Big Ten, 14-13-3 
overall) comes in at No. 15 in 
PairWise and is going into the 
lion’s den Friday to face off 
against No. 1 Notre Dame. The 
two teams will subsequently 
play on Sunday in Ann Arbor.

The last time the Fighting 

Irish (16-3-1, 22-6-2) and the 
Wolverines 
met 
— 
on 
the 

weekend of Jan. 5 — Notre Dame 
took the weekend sweep and 
didn’t seem to slow down on its 
way to a headlining position in 
the NCAA.

However, while many thought 

the sweep could’ve been a dagger 
in Michigan’s season, it did quite 
the opposite. The Wolverines 
were able to pick themselves up 
by their skates and come into 
contention for a playoff berth.

In 
two 
wins 
this 
past 

weekend 
against 
Michigan 

State, Michigan proved that 
it could finally streamline its 
now-reliable backline to its high-
paced front line.

Junior 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody — who has clearly played 
himself out of midseason woes 
— and freshmen forward Jack 
Becker, along with defenseman 
Quinn Hughes, all notched goals 

on the weekend, proving a sense 
of versatility unparalleled by any 
prior performance.

Sophomore 
goaltender 

Hayden Lavigne’s .905 save 
percentage provides the defense 
with a crucial safety net as well.

“That’s why we come to play 

at a school like this, to play 
in these big games,” Lavigne 
said 
Tuesday. 
“With 
the 

pressure comes a little bit more 
excitement, comes a little bit 
louder fan base, 
so 
it’s 
a 
good 

atmosphere to be 
around.”

However, it may 

be too easy to boast 
such statistics in 
a series against 
Michigan 
State, 

who ranks last in 
the Big Ten. This 
is 
Notre 
Dame 

we’re 
talking 

about.

Fighting 
Irish 
goaltender 

Cale Morris claims the best save 
percentage in the NCAA with an 
astounding .950. Forward Jake 
Evans spearheads the Notre 
Dame offense with 32 points, but 
is supported by forward Andrew 
Oglevie — who scored twice in 

the teams’ last contest — and 
defenseman Jordan Gross, who 
are both no less deadly.

“I think we know what to 

expect,” Lavigne said. “I think 
that was kind of where you saw 
a lot of their early success in the 
season, it was their first year 
in the Big Ten, so nobody had 
really seen them consistently.

“ … It’s definitely going to be 

a little bit (of a) different game I 
think than it was than the first 
two, but it’s still going to be a 
tight game for sure.”

It’s never too late to have a 

fulcrum in a season. In a hostile 
environment Friday and then 
on familiar ground Sunday, 
Michigan has a chance to upset 
the Big Ten leader and solidify 
itself as a formidable foe in the 
postseason.

But if other big games are any 

indication, the Wolverines often 
get out to early leads and let 
their opponents inch back.

“We’ve got to learn how to 

play in tight games with a lead 
when there’s a lot on the line,” 
Pearson said. “We’re young, 
we’re young. We’ve got the third 
youngest team in college hockey. 
It’s not an excuse, maybe we’ve 
got a lot of guys who haven’t 
been in this position, in these 
games, and we’ve got to learn.

“It’s 
nice 

to learn some 
lessons 
on 

winning. 
I 

know everyone 
talks 
about 

‘well when you 
lose, ah we’ll 
learn from it 
and move on,’ 
well, bologna. 
Let’s win and 
learn from it 

and move on.”

Notre Dame recorded losses 

against Minnesota, Wisconsin 
and Ohio State in the past month 
— two of which Michigan have 
prevailed over this season — 
meaning the menace is human, 
and the Wolverines could see an 
opening this weekend to attack.

“It’s nice to 
learn some 
lessons on 
winning.”

Band always involved

There is one common group 

at 
every 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball game. Whether the 
Wolverines are winning by a 
landslide, in a tight match-up, or 
down by 35 points, they will cheer 
on Michigan come hell or high 
water.

They keep the crowd excited, 

whether Crisler sits empty or full, 
and even have some influence on 
the game itself.

They are the Michigan band.
Every home game, they sit on 

the north side of Crisler Center 
just behind the hoop, decked out 
in maize shirts and white gloves, 
commanding attention.

Along with playing the famous 

“Hail to the Victors” at every 
possible moment, the band has 
some fun antics that always provide 
a good laugh. During halftime, the 
band likes to get really involved 
with the fans in Crisler Arena.

“For 
Blues 
Brothers, 
the 

trombones will always run off 
and go hang out,” said sophomore 
tuba 
player 
Maisey 
Schuler. 

“Sometimes they’ll go into the 
student section, sometimes they’ll 
go into the stands and sometimes 
the trumpets will join them.”

The trombones always end up 

in a different area of the arena 
and never fail to startle a fan. In 
the past, they have sprinted to the 
complete opposite end of Crisler, 
run down onto the court or even 
sat down right in the middle of 
a group of spectators. No matter 
what they do, they never fail to get 
a laugh.

The Michigan marching band 

also always aims to please the 
fans and play music just for them. 
One song known to all Michigan 
students that has worked its 
way into their repertoire is “Mr. 
Brightside” by The Killers.

“This is something that started 

with football actually, we had a 
fan favorites show and brought 
in Mr. Brightside so we brought 

that here,” Schuler said. “We also 
brought in music for the ‘90s theme 
night a couple weeks ago. So now 
we play ‘90s songs too.”

In addition to playing music 

that every Michigan fan knows 
and loves, the band also leads the 
crowd in cheers.

While Michigan’s opponent is 

shooting free-throws, the band 
will screech in unison at the top 
of their lungs in order to distract 
the shooter. Another surprisingly 
successful tactic that the band does 
is trick the opponent into taking 
a bad shot before the shot clock 
expires.

When the shot clock shows 20 

seconds left, the marching band 
will begin to loudly countdown 
from ten, hoping to trick the 
opponent 
— 
and 
has 
been 

successful on multiple occasions.

“It’s hilarious,” Schuler said. 

“Every time we’re like ‘Wait, 
did they actually believe us?’ 
Sometimes, it’s just absurd. (There 
will) be twenty seconds left and 
they’ll shoot.”

Even when morale is low, the 

band is always in high spirits and 
will be enthusiastic until the very 
last second. The rest of Crisler may 
be silent or have given up, but the 
band never will.

The trumpets and tubas seem 

to fittingly be the loudest and most 
boisterous sections of the band 
and are constantly bringing in new 
ideas for cheers.

“There are some leaders among 

us. Some of the veteran trumpets 
for sure always bring in new cheers 
and stuff that they come up with 
and they keep us pumped up,” 
said Schuler. “And of course the 
tubas do all kinds of goofy stuff 
like bouncing around the court 
after the third quarter for women’s 
games, and the goofy things keep 
us motivated.”

Even if things are looking bad 

for the Wolverines or Crisler looks 
empty, you can always count on the 
band to bring energy, enthusiasm 
and a little bit of fun to women’s 
basketball games.

Simmons turning corner as regular season comes to a close

Jaaron Simmons ambled into 

the media room like he was a 
regular.

In 
reality, 
the 
fifth-year 

senior hadn’t been in a post-
game interview since the Nov. 3 
exhibition against Grand Valley 
State, but his confident gait to the 
top right corner of the room would 
have made you think otherwise. 
Just as he did over three months 
ago, Simmons entered donning a 
mesh, long-sleeve Michigan shirt 
with a sweat-soaked Gatorade 
towel draped around his neck.

Simmons 
had 
just 
seen 

his most playing time — 12 
minutes — since Dec. 16 against 
Detroit Mercy, catalyzing the 
Wolverines’ eventual runaway 
win over Iowa on Wednesday. He 
cracked a smile.

“It feels good,” he said, “but it’s 

the same thing. I’ve gotta keep 
working everyday, continue to 
prepare myself everyday. That’s 
really it.”

The smile had faded by the 

end of his simple answer — the 
quiet sentiment of someone who 
doesn’t want to celebrate his 
brief moment in the spotlight 
too much. His production in 
Wednesday’s matchup, though, 
demonstrated 
exactly 
what 

John Beilein brought him in to 
do in the first place. And that’s 
something to celebrate.

In the beginning minutes 

of the contest, the Hawkeyes’ 
extended zone defense visibly 
shook 
starting 
point 
guard 

Zavier Simpson. The sophomore 
ranks fourth in the Big Ten with 
a 3-1 assist-turnover ratio, but 
coughed it up three times in the 
game’s first 2:17, helping amount 
to a 7-0 deficit. Thus came the 
earliest entrance into a game in 
Simmons’ Michigan career.

He channeled his University 

of Ohio days as a confident 
ball-handler, staving off Iowa 
defenders in its early full-court 
press 
and 
commanding 
his 

teammates around the court. 
Shortly into his shift, he drilled a 
three to lessen the margin to only 
one point.

Five minutes later, Simmons 

was still in and Michigan had 
a three-point lead. He stole a 
telegraphed pass at the top of the 
key from Iowa’s Brady Ellingson 
and charged ahead for the fast 
break. 
Simmons 
doubtfully 

turned his head to see who was 
chasing him down — but nobody 
was even close, and he smoothly 
lofted it off the glass and in.

For the first time on both 

sides of the ball, it looked like 
the Simmons experiment was 

finally bringing positive results, 
as he registered a five-point, 
four-assist 
performance. 
The 

statline appeared as a blip on the 
radar, but in just 12 minutes for a 
team devoid of energy, it was the 
perfect display.

“It takes a whole lot to 

learn the offense, and it’s a 
complicated offense,” said senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, “but I think you’re 
starting to see him grow.”

Added Simmons: “It’s easier 

to get into a flow because I know 
more. I know more of what we’re 
doing. In the beginning of the 
season it was very challenging. 
Going out there, you’re thinking 
a lot, me personally, because I’m 
learning new stuff every single 
day.

“Now I’m starting to get it. 

Now I don’t have to think what 

play we call, what we gotta do 
now. It’s more ‘we’re gonna run 
this’ and I can flow into it.”

Simmons’ struggles have been 

no secret. After Michigan’s Jan. 
21 game against Rutgers, Beilein 
said the graduate transfer “hasn’t 
worked out so far,” referring to 
his inability to play comfortably 
in already limited minutes.

The rocky transition, Simmons 

claims, was a result of complex 
schemes that he never saw with 
the Bobcats. Remaining mentally 
tough was the only way for 
Simmons to get over the change.

“(I) never ask why. ‘Why am I 

not playing or why am I not doing 
this?’ It’s just ‘How can I get 
better and put myself in a position 
to get out there?’ ” Simmons 
said. “... I don’t question stuff. 
I just — I’m ready. Just battle it 
out. Tough situations will come, 

tough people last.”

While his time with the 

Wolverines 
hasn’t 
gone 
as 

planned, he is on the verge of 
going somewhere he’s never 
been: the NCAA Tournament. 
But first, he will say goodbye to 
his short-lived Michigan tenure 
during Senior Day against No. 8 
Ohio State on Sunday.

Simmons , ironically, still calls 

himself a freshman given all of 
the new plays and terminology 
thrusted upon him in his lone 
season. As fast as he realized he 
was learning stuff he had never 
seen before, his final year was 
ending. And while he hopes 
to extend it to the uncharted 
territory of the Tournament, the 
enthusiasm of the team would say 
otherwise.

“The way coach be talking, 

he’s talking like if we lose a game 

we might not even make it to the 
tournament,” Simmons said. “I’m 
just hoping we get there.”

For Simmons, the tournament 

is priority number one. At one 
point, it may have been the 
NBA or even just filling Derrick 
Walton Jr.’s shoes. Later on, it 
may have been finding some 
semblance of his game from his 
Ohio days. Now, those goals are 
far, far behind him. He’s shown 
flashes of improvement as the 
regular season dwindles, but 
it remains to be seen if it is too 
little, too late.

If the Wolverines take care 

of business down the stretch, 
though, Simmons will have the 
opportunity to play in his first 
tournament game, spotlight or 
not.

That’s something to smile 

about.
