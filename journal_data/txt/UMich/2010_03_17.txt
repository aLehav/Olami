DIGITAL DRESS REHEARSAL

Museums must now
reassess culturally
unidentifiable Native
American remains
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
A change in the 1990 Native
American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act may force the
University of Michigan's Museum
of Anthropology - as well as muse-
ums across the country - to redis-
tribute their collections of Native
American human remains.
The act requires museums to
maintain inventories of Native
American artifacts, make inven-
tory lists available to the public and
work closely with tribes to return
artifacts that are associated with
specific tribes.
On Monday, a NAGPRA com-
mittee approved a change in the
act that will force museums -
like the University's Museum of
Anthropology - to inform Native
American tribes that "culturally
unidentifiable" remains found in
their tribal regions may potentially
be returned to them.
Before the addition to the act,
museums were not obligated to

return anyunidentifiable remains.
Currently, the University's
Museum of Anthropology houses
1,390. "culturally unidentifiable"
remains, which have been the sub-
ject of controversy in the past.
After much debate on campus
about the remains, the University
formed the Advisory Committee on
Culturally Unidentifiable Human
Remains last October to deter-
mine how to deal with the Native
American culturally unidentifiable
remains that are in the museum's
collection.
According to an Oct. 15 Michi-
gan Daily article, the committee
was created partially in response
to the expectation that NAGPRA
would soon be revised and to help
the University decide how best to
deal with the remains.
LSA sophomore Alys Alley, the
co-chair of the Native American
Student Association at the Univer-
sity, wrote in an e-mail interview
that she and other members of the
group believe that the new rule will
mean that the culturally unidenti-
fiable remains in the University's
possession will be returned to their
respective tribes.
"Many of those remains that are
held by the University of Michi-
gan Museum of Anthropology are
the ancestors of the Native Ameri-

RHA to survey udents today on
gender-neutral housing optons

Survey meant to
assess residents'
interest in proposal
By CHELSEY DAMBRO
For the Daily
The Residence Hall Associa-
tion will be sending out a survey
today to gauge students' interest
in the option of gender-neutral
housing to those living in Univer-

sity Housing.
In April 2009, the Spectrum
Center Student Advisory Board
drafted a proposal to reevalu-
ate the current gender-neutral
housing option. Since then, many
groups on campus like the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union, the
Michigan Student Assembly, and
now, RHA have supported the
proposal to make accommoda-
tions for students who may feel
uncomfortable living in same-sex
living arrangements.

Though there are options cur-
rently available for transgender
students, the proposal would offer
students more gender-neutral
housing options.
The Spectrum Center website
states that current gender-neu-
tral housing accommodations are
made on a case-by-case basis and
that applicants have no guarantee
that their preferences will be met
due to limited space.
In addition, according to the
University Housing website, stu-

dents undergoing sex reassign-
ment surgery are placed in rooms
according to their birth gender
until their surgery is complete.
LSA sophomore Lindsey
Schmuker, who is involved with
the Gender Neutral Housing
Coalition and Working Group and
chair of the Housing Advocacy
Committee of RHA, said she had
a large role in creating the survey
According to Schumker, the
survey is expected to include a

Website developers

miscommunication

Michigan Student Assembly
President Abhishek Mahanti con-

tinued to apologize last night for
a failed MSA website that cost
$9,244.60.
At the assembly's meeting yes-
terday, Mahanti said though an
attempt to fix MSA's old website
cost more than $9,000, the cost
of the project was originally esti-
mated to be $3,000 to $4,000.
"This was not a line item bud-
get," Mahanti said at the meeting.
"We did not have a hard limit set."
In an interview after the meet-

ing, Mahanti said he was sorry
the project ended up being so
expensive.
"I apologize for the expendi-
ture," he said in the interview.
"I've taken responsibility for it
and hope we can move on."
At the meeting, Mahanti told
representatives that it was a
mistake for him not to inquire
further about how much money
was being spent on the website or

St. Patrick's Day partying at fra-

of a campus tradition, and accord-

cials, the activities are sanctioned
by the IFC.
Michael Miniaci, IFC's vice

Social Responsibility Committee.
But if fraternities do have daytime

parties, they're expected to fol-

Fraternities are allowed to have

Three current and

named in lawsuit
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
A former Michigan Daily news
editor has filed a lawsuit against
the University of Michigan, The
Michigan Daily and three current
and former Daily editors.
The former editor and current
University student, Julie Rowe,
resigned from her position as a
senior news editor at the Daily

in March 2009 after top editors
claimed Rowe had plagiarized in
two articles - one of which ran in
print and online, while the other
was discovered before publica-
tion.
In her lawsuit, filed recently in
Washtenaw County Circuit Court
and disclosed in the University
Board of Regents monthly liti-
gation report on Monday, Rowe
alleges that Gary Graca, then edi-
tor in chief of the Daily, Courtney
Ratkowiak, then managing editor
and now a columnist for the Daily,
and Jacob Smilovitz, then man-
aging news editor and current
editor in chief of the Daily, were

wrong in their assessment that
her actions constituted plagia-

the University sanctioned the
newspaper's alleged unfair treat-
ment by neglecting to appropri-

claims to be editorially indepen-
dent.
Rowe has brought four charg-
es - defamation, intentional
infliction of emotional distress
and denial of substantive and
procedural due process rights -

St. Patrick's Day of yore

Many students will cele-
brate St. Patrick's Day today
by dressing in green, drink-
ing green beer and opting
to go to the bar instead of
to lecture. But the celebra-
tion of St. Patrick's Day in
Ann Arbor has been a tradi-
tion that started long before
current students were even
born.
Green beer was already
a St. Patrick's Day favor-
ite in 1950, according to a
March 18, 1950 article in
The Michigan Daily, with
students and Ann Arbor
residents crowdingthe local
bars, drinking to honor the
famous St. Patrick.
But in 60 years since, at
least one thing has changed:
whereas the bars used to
open between noon and 3
p.m. on St. Patrick's Day and

close promptly at midnight,
they have since adjusted
their hours and are open
early in the morning to well
past the stroke of midnight.
The celebrations have
continued over the years
and by 1980, there were
over 3,000 people of Irish
descent living in Ann Arbor,
according to a census at the
time. Two Ann Arbor locals
who spoke to the Daily at
the time discussed the dif-
ferences between the sym-
bolic meaning of the holiday
and how it's celebrated,
according to a March 17,
1985 article in Daily.
"In Ireland it's a holy day
- you go to Mass...It's fes-
tive the entire week, not just
one day like it is here," Tony
Paxton, an Irish immigrant
who lived in Ann Arbor in

1985 told the Daily at the
time.
Jack Foley, a store owner
in Ann Arbor at the time,
told the Daily that a big part
of the holiday is the festivi-
ties that go with it.
"It's the parties. It's just a
joyful time to celebrate. It's
an excuse for a party," Foley
said to the Daily.
In 1980, bars that now
cease to exist took part in
the day's celebratory events,
and much of the green beer
that was served left a linger-
ing color on students' teeth.
Even the University got
swept up in the spirit of the
day as the University Club
hosted Gaelic dancers and
served Irish whiskey, cof-
fee and corned beef sand-
wiches.

Hit men thought
to be involved with
Juarez drug cartel
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico
(AP) - Confused hit men may have
gone to the wrong party, the FBI
said yesterday as it cast doubt on
fears that the slaying of three peo-
ple with ties to the U.S. consulate
shows that Mexican drug cartels
have launched an offensive against
U.S. government employees.
Gunmen chased two white
SUVs from the birthday party of a
consulate employee's child on Sat-
urday and opened fire as horrified
relatives screamed. The two near-
simultaneous attacks left three
adults dead and at least two chil-
dren wounded.
The attack drives home just
how dangerous Ciudad Juarez has
become - and just how vulnerable
those who live and work there can
be, despite the Mexican govern-
ment's claims that most victims
are drug smugglers.

According to one of several
lines of investigation, the assail-
ants - believed to be aligned with
the Juarez drugcartel - may have
been ordered to attack a white
SUV leaving a party and mis-
takenly went to the "Barquito de
Papel," which puts on children's
parties and whose name means
"Paper Boat."
"We .don't have any informa-
tion that these folks were directly
targeted because of their employ-
ment by the U.S. government or
their U.S. citizenship,"FBI spokes-
woman Andrea Simmons told The
Associated Press by phone from El
Paso, just across the Rio Grande
from Ciudad Juarez.
The FBI is still investigatingthe
backgrounds of the victims.
Experts cast doubt on the idea.
that drug cartels would be inter-
ested in turningtheir guns on U.S.
government employees.
"A systematic, nationwide shift
to the use of such tactics would
work against drug traffickers'
interests," said Allyson Benton, an
analystwith the Eurasia Group. "It

would dramatically raise the level
of both Mexican and U.S. govern-
mental involvement in the fight
against organized crime."
The wife of one of the victims, a
13-year employee of the consulate
named Hilda, described to a friend
how she watched in horror as hit
men pumped bullets into her SUV
with her husband and children
inside. She had been trailing her
family in a second car when the
attack occurred.
She leapt screaming from her
car, begging the men to stop and
telling them her children - ages
2, 4 and 7 - were inside, the
friend said. But they continued
until her husband, Jorge Alberto
Salcido, was covered in blood,
slumped dead behind the steer-
ing wheel.
All three children in the car
were treated for injuries and
released - the older children
grazed by bullets and the youngest
hit by shards of glass, the friend
said. His account differed from
authorities who said two children
were in the car.

Attorney General
says bin Laden will
never face trial in
the U.S.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Attor-
ney General Eric Holder told
Congress yesterday that Osama
bin Laden will never face trial in
the United States because he will
not be captured alive.
In testy exchanges with House
Republicans, the attorney general
compared bin Laden to mass mur-
derer Charles Manson and pre-
dicted that events would ensure
"we will be reading Miranda
rights to the corpse of Osama bin
Laden" not to the al-Qaida leader
as a captive.
Holder sternly rejected criti-
cism from GOP members of a
House Appropriations subcom-
mittee, who contend it is too dan-
gerous to put terror suspects on
trial in federal civilian courts as
Holder has proposed.

The attorney general said it
infuriates him to hear conserva-
tive critics complain that terror-
ists would get too many rights in
the court system.
Terrorists in court "have the
same rights that Charles Man-
son would have, any other kind
of mass murderer," the attorney
general said. "It doesn't mean
that they're going to be coddled,
it doesn't mean that they're going
to be treated with kid gloves."
The comparison to convicted
killer Manson angered Rep. John
Culberson, R-Texas, who said
it showed the Obama adminis-
tration doesn't understand the
American public's desire to treat
terrorists as wartime enemies,
not criminal defendants.
"My constituents and I just
have a deep-seated and profound
philosophical difference with the
Obama administration," Culber-
son said.
Holder, his voice rising,
charged that Culberson's argu-
ments ignored basic facts about
the law and the fight against ter-

rorists.
"Let's deal with reality," Hold-
er said. Bin Laden "will 'never
appear in an American court-
room."
Pressed further on that point,
Holder said: "The possibility of
catching him alive is infinitesi-
mal. He will be killed by us or he
will be killed by his own people
so he can't be captured by us."
Much of the hearing centered
around the Obama administra-
tion's stalled plan to put the
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the
professed mastermind of the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on trial.
Last year, Holder announced
the trial would take place in fed-
eral civilian court in New York
City, not far from the site of the
destroyed World Trade Center.
In the face of resistance from
New York Mayor Michael Bloom-
berg and other local politicians,
that plan was shelved and the
White House is now considering
putting KSM and four alleged co-
conspirators into a military com-
mission trial.

DETROIT
Honda recalls
410,000 mini-vans
and small trucks
Honda Motor Co. will recall
more than 410,000 Odyssey mini-
vans and Element small trucks
because of braking system prob-
lems that could make it tougher to
stop the vehicle if not repaired.
The recall includes 344,000
Odysseys and 68,000 Elements
from the 2007 and 2008 model
years.
Honda said in a statement that
over time, brake pedals can feel
"soft" and must be pressed closer
to the floor to stop the vehicles.
Left unrepaired, the problem could
cause loss of braking power and
possibly a crash, Honda spokesman
Chris Martin said.
"It's definitely not operating the
way it should, and it's safety sys-
tems, so it brings it to the recall sta-
tus," he said.
The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration has report-
ed three crashes due to the prob-
lem with minor injuries and no
deaths, Martin said. Honda notified
NHTSA of the recall yesterday, he
said.

45 Detroit schools
slated for closing
under district plan
A $1 billion plan from Detroit
Public Schools' emergency finan-
cial manager calls for closing 45
schools during the next five years,
including two of the city's oldest
traditional high schools.
Robert Bobb plans to release the
complete list and possible closing
dates today.
Bobb's five-year master facili-
ties plan calls for closing 45 schools
between 2010-2015, renovating
some and consolidating others into
smaller and newer buildings as the
district prepares for a projected
enrollment drop of about 30,000
students.
Osborn, Kettering and North-
western, along with the massive
83-year-old Cooley and 95-year-old
Southwestern high schools even-
tually, would close for good. Four
alternative high schools also would
close.

Chile government
reports earthquake
and tsunami left
700 dead
The earthquake and tsunami
that struck Chile last month killed
700 people and caused damages of*
nearly $30 billion, according to the
government. Andthe ground hasn't
stopped shaking.
A magnitude-6.7 aftershock
rocked south-central Chile Monday
night, adding to the raw nerves and
mounting damages caused by the
Feb. 27 quake.
Chile's Interior Minister Rodri-

go Hinzpeter updated the known
death and damage toll on yester-
day, saying 200 people previously
listed as missing would be added to
the count of 500 previously known
dead.
"In economic terms, this is the
worst catastrophe Chile has suf-
fered," Hinzpeter added. He esti-
mated that damages could reach
nearly $30 billion, with insurance
covering just $5 billion to $8 billion.

Somali pirates freed a North
Korean chemical tanker and its 28
crew yesterday after the owners
delivered a ransom, the European
Union Naval Force said.
The MV Theresa VIII was
hijacked last November, northwest
of the island nation of the Sey-
chelles.
The vessel had not asked for

John Harbour. He could not pro-

Also yesterday, the EU Naval
Force said it intercepted two pirate
groups. The two groups, each con-
sisting of a mothership and two
skiffs, were tracked by maritime
patrol aircraft after commercial
ships reported attempted attacks.
Seventeen pirates in total had
been detained, Harbour said.

breach opened when Israel
announced last week, during a
visit to Jerusalem by Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden, that it will build
1,600 more Jewish houses in east
Jerusalem.
Israeli officials privately say
Prime Minster Benjamin Netan-
yahu - Washington-bound next
week - is willing to go to some
lengths to-calm tensions. U.S.
officials are also looking for a
way to finesse their demand that
Israel cancel the construction.
There is no obvious half-mea-
sure, and both countries are wary
of looking weak to the other, to
important political constituen-
cies at home and to the Arab
world. Still, the rhetoric from
both capitals suddenly softened.
"We have a close, unshakable
bond between the United States
and Israel and between the
American and Israeli people,"
Clinton said. "We share common
values and a commitment to a
democratic future for the world
and we are both committed to
a two-state solution. But that
doesn't mean that we're going to
agree."
Clinton has been the leading
voice of U.S. outrage over the epi-
sode, which embarrassed Biden
and called into question Israel's
stated willingness to resume
talks with the United States as

an intermediary. She has called
the announcement an insult and
dressed down Netanyahu by
telephone last week. The United
States wants to see a gesture
from Israel to the Palestinians
and a statement that the biggest
issues dividing those two parties,
including the fate of Jerusalem,
will be on the table for talks.
"Israel appreciates and values
the warm words of Secretary of
State Clinton about the deep ties
between Israel and the U.S. and
the commitment of the U.S. to
Israel's security," government
spokesman Mark Regev said
in Jerusalem.""Concerning the
commitment to peace - Israel's
government has proved over
the past year its commitment to
peace, in words and in deeds."
For President Barack Obama,
the unusually public fight tests
his willingness to take Israel
to task in the name of Mideast
peace, even if it means angering
some powerful political forces
whose support is necessary to
further his domestic agenda.
For his part, Netanyahu is left
to choose between his desire to
populate east Jerusalem with
Jews and his need not to alienate
his all-important U.S. ally.
Netanyahu's looming visit
leaves little time to paper over
the rift. If Netanyahu gets a cold
shoulder, he has little incentive
to scrap settlements the United
States sees as an affront to peace
talks. If he skips the trip entirely,
the Obama administration risks
a backlash from the pro-Israel
lobby and its congressional back-
ers, many of whom think Wash-
ington has already taken the spat
too far.
The dispute exposed ten-
sions that have been simmer-
ing between the two allies since
the election of a liberal-minded
U.S. administration and a right-
leaning Israeli government more
than a year ago. The United
States views the housing expan-
sion as a deliberate complication
to an eventual peace deal.
Palestinians want east Jerusa-
lem to be the capital of an even-

tual independent state.
"Though we differ on certain
issues, our discussions are being
conducted in an atmosphere of
cooperation as befitting long-
standing relations between
allies," Israel's ambassador to
Washington, Michael Oren, said
last night. "I am confident that
we will overcome these differ-
ences shortly."
Netanyahu yesterday ordered
his ministers and spokespeople
not to talk publicly about the
building plan.
However, Interior Minister
Eli Yishai, whose office issued
the order for the new homes, did
agree to speak to The Associated
Press about other issues, such as
the need to calm tensions with
the U.S.
"I am very sorry that there is
an escalation now and we are
taking many measures to calm
this," he said. However, he added
that "Israel is independent and
can do what it thinks is right."
An AP reporter'was poked in
the back by a Yidhai aide when
he asked the minister about the
construction plan. The minister
then abruptly ended the inter-
view, removing a microphone
from his lapel.
The Obama administration's
Mideast peace envoy canceled a
trip to Israel and the West Bank
this week due to what the State
Department said were schedul-
ing conflicts.
Clinton played down a con-
nection to U.S. pique, but admin-
istration officials acknowledged
a link, saying there was no point
in sending former Sen. George
Mitchell now because Israel had
not budged on the U.S. demand
to roll back the planned settle-
ments.
Clinton restated U.S. "dismay
and disappointment" with the
announcement but disputed the
perception of the relationship in
crisis.
"I don't buy that," she said.
There are no current plans for
Netanyahu to meet with Obama
before his departure for his over-
seas trip, nor with Biden.

Vatican officials say
investigators will
report to Holy See
this week with results
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Vati-
can investigators have completed
their probe into the Legionaries
of Christ, the conservative order
that was once hailed by Rome but
fell into scandal after it revealed
that its founder had fathered a
child and had molested seminar-
ians.
The Vatican said yesterday its
five investigators are to report
back to Rome this week about
their examination of the Legion-
aries' 120 seminaries, schools and
communities around the globe. In
a statement, the Legionaries said
the first phase of the inquiry was
over and that a final report would
still take several months for Rome
to complete.
While the Vatican's recom-
mendations are unknown, Vati-
can analysts have speculated that
the Holy See would at the very
least appoint new leadership for
the order and outline a series of
reforms. Its recommendations
will be closely watched, given
the current focus on the Vatican's
handling the growing sex abuse
crisis convulsing the church in
Europe.
Pope Benedict XVI ordered the
probe last year after prominent
Legionaries members acknowl-
edged its late founder, the Rev.
Marcial Maciel of Mexico, had
fathered a daughter and had sexu-
ally abused seminarians. Since
then, a Mexican woman has come
forward saying she had a lengthy
relationship with Maciel, that he
fathered her two sons, adopted a
third and sexually abused two of
them.
The disclosure of Maciel's dou-
ble life has caused enormous tur-
moil inside the Legionaries and its
lay affiliate, Regnum Christi, par-
ticularly because the leadership
has been less than forthcoming
with information. The order had
essentially created a personality
cult around Maciel, teaching that
he was a hero whose life should be
studied and emulated.
In the wake of the revelations,
the order has taken down pictures
of Maciel that used to adorn its

institutes, edited its Web sites and
reviewed editions of books that
heavily quoted from Maciel's writ-
ings, the Legionaries' New York
and Atlanta directors wrote in a
letter to Regnum Christi members
in September.
Still, several U.S. dioceses have
either restricted the Legionaries'
work or set limits on its recruit-
ment practices. The archdiocese
of Miami has barred Legionaries
priests from exercising any minis-
try whatsoever.
The Vatican investigation
was extraordinary since it only
launches a so-called "apostolic
visitation" when it considers a
group unable to correct a major
problem on its own.
In 2002, at the height of the
clergy sex abuse scandal in the'
United States, the Vatican ordered'
an evaluation of all U.S. seminar-
ies. More recently, it has ordered
one for U.S. women's religions
orders.
Five bishops appointed by-
Rome spent eight months visit-
ing Legionaries communities to
get firsthand knowledge of the
order and its work. In a state-
ment yesterday, the Legionaries
said over the next several months.
there may be further communica-,
tions between the investigators
and Rome before the pope "gives
the instructions that he considers
suitable and necessary."
Even after the revelations came
out, questions remained about
whether any current leaders cov-
ered up Maciel's misdeeds and-
whether any donations were used
to facilitate the misconduct or pay
off victims.
One of the Mexican sons alleg-
edly fathered and abused by-
Maciel, Jose Raul Gonzalez, has
said he asked the Legionaries of
Christ for $26 million because
Maciel had promised him a trust'
fund when he died and as finan-
cial compensation for the alleged
sexual abuse.
The Legionaries was formed in
1941 and became one of the most
influential and fastest-growing
orders in the Roman Catholic
Church. Pope John Paul II cham.
pioned the group, which became
known for its orthodox theol-
ogy, military-style discipline,-
fundraising prowess and success

GOP says Dems' plan on
health bill abuses rules

Pelosi ponders
using unorthodox
methods to pass
health care reform
WASHINGTON (AP) - It is a
brazen abuse of Congress' rules.
Or a legitimate tactic used many
times by both parties.
Republicans and Democrats
have sharply divergent views
about the method being contem-
plated by House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi for a final vote on President
Barack Obama's health care over-
haul perhaps this week.
Using rhetoric reminiscent
of the tea party movement, the
GOP says Democrats are fla-
grantly ignoring the will of the
American people by trying to
pass the legislation to reshape
the U.S. health care system with-
out a direct House vote on the
bill approved by the Senate in
December.
Democrats responded yes-
terday that the moves they are
contemplating have been used

by both parties numerous times
to pass legislation such as huge
increases in the government's
ability to borrow money, restric-
tions on immigrant workers and
creation of a presidential line-
item veto, which was later ruled
unconstitutional.
The attacks by GOP lead-
ers underscore an offensive by
Republicans hoping to either
derail Obama's top legislative
priority by scaring off waver-
ing Democratic lawmakers, or to
bank arguments they can employ
against Democratic candidates
in this fall's congressional cam-
paigns.
Top House Democrats are
hunting votes so the cham-
ber can finally send Obama the
11-year, nearly $1 trillion health
care bill the Senate approved on
Christmas Eve. Democrats also
want to send him a smaller, sec-
ond bill changing the overhaul
legislation, such as easing a new
tax on high-priced health insur-
ance policies and killing extra
Medicaid payments to Nebraska
that have become a symbol of
Washington's backroom deal-

making.
House Democrats worry that
a direct vote on the broad Sen-
ate bill would prove unpopular
among voters. To try easing the
political pain, House leaders are
considering a process in which
the same House vote approving
the rules for debating the smaller
fix-it bill would automatically
send the huge Senate-approved
measure to Obama.
Pelosi, D-Calif., seemed to give
Republicans an easy target when
she told liberal bloggers Monday
that she liked the idea "because
people don't have to vote on the
Senate bill."
House Minority Leader John
Boehner, R-Ohio, said the Dem-
ocratic effort to avoid a direct
House vote on the health over-
haul bill was "the ultimate in
Washington power grabs, a leg-
islative ploy that lets Democrats
defy the will of the American
people."
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas,
accused Pelosi of seeking "an
immaculate conception" that
would make it appear they hadn't
actually voted on the health bill.

Electingto vote.
The University should ban exams on election days
College students aren't known for their overwhelming
turnout on Election Day. Yet, while young people can
rightly be called out for their electoral apathy, colleges
can and should do more to encourage civic engagement. The Uni-
versity shouldn't force students to choose between cramming for
an exam worth 30 percent of their grade and exercising their dem-
ocratic right to vote, as was the case for some on Nov. 4, 2008. To
prevent this from happening again, the Michigan Student Assem-
bly passed a resolution calling on the University to ban exams on
national election days. But it is imperative that MSA also push for
similar bans in the cases of state and local elections.

Bipartisan civil rights

mhe very idea of marriage is
basic to recognition as equals
in our society; any status
short of that is
inferior, unjust,
and unconstitu-
tional." These are
the words of Theo- ,
dore B. Olson as
quoted in a Jan. 9
Newsweek article.
Olson is one of two
lawyers seeking to
overturn Propo- TOMMASO
sition 8, a 2008
referendum that PAVONE
banned gay mar -______
riage in California.
Olson stated that
he took the case because "this is not
a conservative or liberal issue;it is an
American one, and it is time that we,
as Americans, embraced it."
Olson's Newsweek piece is intel-
ligent and thought-provoking. But
what renders it particularly unique is
the background of the author: Olson
is a staunch conservative. He rose to
prominence as the foremost conserva-
tive lawyer in the nation by winning
the Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case
and ensuring George W. Bush's 2000
presidential victory. And yet, almost
10 years later, Olson is at the forefront
of the quest for marriage equality.
While Olson's actions could be eas-
ily discounted as an abnormality, an
increasing number of prominent con-
servatives are publicly standing up for
gay rights.
Just a few weeks after Olson's
piece appeared in Newsweek, Cindy
McCain, the wife of 2008 presiden-
tial candidate and current Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), was featured in an
ad released by the pro-gay marriage
NOH8 campaign. NOH8 released a
statement saying, "Cindy McCain
wanted to participate in the cam-
paign to show people that party
doesn't matter.

Then there's the case of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman (I-Coon.), whose recent
record of alliance with the left is weak
at best. A few weeks ago, Lieberman
stated he was "proud" to be the pri-
mary sponsor of a Senate bill that
would repeal the military's "don't
ask, don't tell" policy and allow gays
to serve openly in the military. In a
written statement, Lieberman argued
that Americans should be allowed to
defend their country regardless of
sexual orientation.
Perhaps most striking has been the
support of gay marriage by former
Vice President Dick Cheney. Speak-
ing before the National Press Club in
2009, Cheney highlighted the impact
that having a gay daughter had on his
thinking. "I think people ought to be
free to enter into any kind of union
they wish," he said.
It is clear that the average ideol-
ogy of Olson, McCain, Lieberman and
Cheney falls squarely in conserva-
tive territory. With the exception of
Lieberman, who represents the liberal
state of Connecticut, none of these
figures are likely to gain popularity
among peers because they support gay
marriage. And yet all four have come
out as strong allies of the gay move-
ment. Joining their cause are the Log
Cabin Republicans, a growing nation-
al organization of conservatives who
embrace LGBT rights. They are part
of an increasing number of Americans
who believe that gay rights is a civil
rights issue instead of a political issue.
As a person who identifies as gay, I
am comforted by the fact that Ameri-
cans are uniting across party lines to
support gay rights. While I tolerated
the argument that gays should not be
allowed to marry early in my coming
out process, over time I have realized
that the institution of marriage is con-
stantly evolving. In our nation's past,
polygamous marriages were once
legal and African Americans weren't
allowed to marry whites. These prac-

tices might have survived to the pres-
ent day if people had continued to
support the status quo. If we managed
to abandon the idea that marriage
should be limited to "one (white) man
and one (white) woman" or "one man
and multiple women," there is little
reason why the definition of marriage
can't survive a further revision.
Gay rights are a
civil issue, not a
political one.
My support for gay marriage comes
fromwithin - at the deepest of human
levels. I believe that, at its core, mar-
tiage is a symbolic representation
of two people's love for one another,
and to deny people's ability to marry
implicitly repudiates their love. I find
strength in the long but successful his-
tory of the civil rights movement. As
Mahatma Gandhi once said, "When I
despair, I remember that all through
history the way of truth and love has
always won. There have been tyrants
and murderers and for a time they
seem invincible but in the end, they
always fall."
The growing number of unlikely
conservative allies is a testament
to Gandhi's words. As an increas-
ingly diverse coalition of Americans
stands in proud support of marriage
equality, it's clear that, despite ref-
erenda like Proposition 8, gay rights
opponents are like fish swimming
against the flow of the river. And for
that, every ally, especially our con-
servative ones, deserves the deepest
praise.

18- to 24-year olds were the least likely to
vote of any age group on Nov. 4, 2008, with
approximately 48 percent participating,
according to U.S. Census Bureau statis-
tics. In response to the low turnout, MSA
recently passed a resolution to encourage
the Board of Regents to prohibit exams
on national election days. Originally pro-
posed by MSA's Voice Your Vote Commis-
sion, the resolution cited long lines at the
polls as a primary deterrent for students
because many students needed to prepare
for exams that took place on Election Day.
It also pointed to a finding by Rock the
Vote, a national organization that encour-
ages voter participation, which concluded
that poorly scheduled exams caused voting
problems at the University.
Admittedly, students can do better. Even
in as exciting an election year as 2008, less
than half of all 18- to 24-year olds made it
to the polls. Even in the most recent MSA
election, which has arguably the most
direct impact on University students, voter
participation was only a dismal 9 percent -
and that election was held entirely online.
That can't all be attributed to schedule
conflicts. Students should make voting
a priority - even if it means they have to
brave standing in line.

Yet as ironic as it may seem for MSA to
advise anyone on increasing voter turnout,
the Voice Your Vote Commission proposal
could actually boost voter attendance. Any
action that removes potential barriers to
exercising one's voice in government is a
no-brainer - especially when it won't have
any serious impact on education or cause
faculty any real undue pain.
Considering the current social and
political climate, it has never been more
important for students to vote. But nation-
al elections aren't the only elections that
matter to students. State and local elec-
tions have at least as much say in shaping
the lives of University students as federal
ones, but generally they see even lower stu-
dent voter turnout and involvement. And.
involving students in local politics would
cultivate a greater sense of city ownership,
making them more likely to care about
improving the city in which they live.
No one denies that young people need to
take greater responsibility for voting seri-
ously and consistently. But the University
has a responsibility to make civic engage-
ment as accessible as possible. Voting is
simply too important to the integrity of a
democratic government to allow barriers
to stand in its way.

Assuming that the next year
and a half goes as planned, I'm
going to become a high school
English teacher
after I graduate in
the spring of 2011.
And as I've start-
ed thinking more
about what that
job will entail, I've
come to some con-
clusions about edu-
cation. One is that
not all students are RACHEL
going to choose to
go to college after VANGILDER
they graduate from
high school, and
there are a variety
of reasons that make that decision
okay. But feelings of inadequacy or
unpreparedness shouldn't be among
the reasons not to go to college.
That's why the recently proposed
national education standards are so
important. Without national stan-
dards, students from some states are
disenfranchised by standards that
don't prepare them for college - and,
even worse, make them feel like they
couldn't cut it in a university set-
ting. National standards would force
states to stop setting low education
standards, to hold onto government
funding and would encourage expec-
tations that foster students' learning.
A proposal for national education
standards for K-12 was released last
week by a panel of educators and
experts sponsored by the National
Governors Association and the Coun-
cil of Chief State School Officers, an
organization made up of superin-
tendents. The suggested standards,
which have received support from the
Obama administration, outline the
math and English skills that students
should have at the completion of each
grade level. The state of Michigan has
signed on to the standards.
But some states have rejected
them. For example, Texas Gov. Rick
Perry has said that only Texans have

the right to determine how their
children are educated, according to
a Mar. 10 report in The New York
Times. Alaska rejected the standards
as well - at least for now. According
to a Mar. 10 AOL News report, the
state is trying to work out which of
the suggested national standards are
more or less rigorous than current
state standards. And Massachusetts
has said that because its standards
are already higher than the suggested
national standards, it shouldn't have
to adopt them.
There's something to be said for
Massachusetts's argument. States
determined to challenge students
shouldn't be discouraged from doing
so. But the national standards should
still exist to prevent some schools
from setting low standards to keep
government funding.
The standards could help solve
several problems in the American
education system - many of which
are directly connected to the 2001 No
Child Left Behind Act. Some NCLB
regulations have contributed to states
setting low standards. NCLB penaliz-
es schools that don't make "Adequate
Yearly Progress" (usually referred
to as AYP by educators) by counter-
intuitively cutting their government
funding. And while simply throwing
money at a problem doesn't fix every-
thing, taking it away doesn't solve
any problems either. If anything,
it only makes them worse. Schools
know this, so some have taken dras-
tic measures to make sure that they
reach AYP and maintain their federal
funding.
The national standards could even
the playing field between schools
that are attempting to make AYP. To
get around having to cover a lot of
ground to make AYP, some states set
low standards. With lower standards,
it's easier for low-performing states
to look good on paper. So Massachu-
setts may turn out students who are
better than those in, say, Georgia,
but its schools could be penalized

because the state's higher standards
make it more difficult to achieve AYP.
Yet, eventhough schoolswithambi-
tious - and maybe even unrealistic
- standards are the ones getting the
cuts, it's really the students at schools
that maintain low standards who suf-
fer. By starting students off at lower
standards, schools are setting up their
students for failure. Students who
enter college without basic reasoning;
math or English skills can't succeed
because they don't have the tools they
need ina university environment.
National standards
are important for
students' learning.
The worst part is that students
know this. When they're unprepared,
they feel it, and that leaves them feel-
ing like they aren't good enough. And
that feeling can severely damage peo
ple's zest to learn. As someone who
loves learning, that's unacceptable to
me. Setting low standards might save
schools' incomes, but it damns stu-
dents. And that trade-off isn't worth
it. Not by a long shot.
There's a good chance that I'll have
to leave Michigan to find a job after
graduation (the market for teachers
isn't great right now, with funding
being cut and schools consolidating)i
so I have a vested interest in ensuring
that all students are being pushed ti
their potentials and that I'll be able
to expect high achievement fron
them. And I don't want excessively
low standards to hamper me or, more
importantly, the students for which
I'll be responsible.

CONCERT PREViEW
Jazz legend Marsalis takes
classical ambitions to Hill

By DAVID RIVA
Daily Arts Writer
In 1874, Modest Mussorgsky composed
a 10-movement suite titled "Pictures at an
Exhibition." The piece as a
whole functioned as a trib-
ute to one of Mussorgsky's
closest friends, an artist Center
who unexpectedly died at a Orchestra
young age, and each move-
ment served to represent a with Wynton
specific drawing or water- Marsalis
color made by the artist.
The circumstances sur- Tonight at 8 p.m.
rounding the conception of Hill Auditorium
"Pictures" were less than $10
ideal, but the composition
has become a celebrated
staple of the classical music world and is a fre-
quent feature piece for orchestras and piano
concerts alike.
More than a century later, composer-musi-
cian Ted Nash has created "Portrait in Seven
Shades" - a seven-movement suite that will
be performed tonight at Hill for "Jazz at Lin-
coln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis"
- which is strikingly similar to "Pictures" in
its structure and overall concept, but differs in
style, purpose and inspiration.
Nash focused his seven movements on
paintings by modern artists like van Gogh and
Picasso. Instead of concentrating on the work
of one individual, Nash is taking a broader
approach in observing and celebrating some
of the art world's most recognizable paintings.
This common motif between the two composi-
tions reveals the undeniable parallels between
visual art and music - a connection Nash was
conscious of throughout his writing of "Por-
trait."
"Painters and musicians, we go through the
same tribulations, (getting) our art out there
and accepted," he explained. "And (we're) able
to express ourselves and appreciate it for that."
Nash also points out the common language
of "textures and colors and shapes and differ-
ent words" that are used to describe the work
of artist and musicians.
"The big difference is a painting is finished,
it's on the wall, it's done, it doesn't change, it
doesn't move," Nash said. "It's all about the
process of having painted it. And music, every
night - especially with jazz music because
there's so much improvisation - every per-
formance of it is different so it's a constantly
evolving process."
Though Nash has been given a greater role

in writing music for the band, Marsalis is still
the evening's main attraction. For Nash, play-
ing alongside one of the best-known names in
jazz is nothing less than a dream come true.
"When I first became aware of Wynton ...
I always really fantasized about playing with
him at some point, being able to play with him
in a band or something, and I didn't think it
would ever really happen," he said.
Nash also pointed out some similarities
between himself and Marsalis: both of their
fathers were jazz musicians and they're rela-
tively close in age.
"After we started working together, at the
very beginning I was a little timid, a little
scared of him because I respected him so
much and I wanted him to like my playing,"
he said of his early experiences with Marsalis.
"As I've grown to know him both musically
and as a personal friend, he's someone that
I not only feel very comfortable with, I feel
we share a lot, we have a lot in common," he
added, saying also that he enjoys being able to
express these feelings musically.
Nash admires Marsalis especially for the
way he selflessly conducts himself around his
fellow band members.
"(Marsalis) is a wonderful person to work
Channelling Modest
Mussorgsky
for because he doesn't approach things from
the point of view of a large ego like a lot of
leaders will," he said. "You'd think that some-
body who's that famous and has gotten that
much recognition and notoriety might have
a lot of ego and (say), 'Well, this band's about
me and it's really just showcasing my play-
ing and you all are supposed to support that.'
No, he's about us as a community playing and
he loves to hear us play as much as he loves
to play, so when we play concerts he's always
making sure that everybody has a chance to
improvise."
Tonight, the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orches-
tra will continue its quest to place "Portrait In
Seven Shades" in the same high-regard in the
jazz world that "Pictures at an Exhibition"
has in the classical community. Ted Nash's
innovative vision, Wynton Marsalis's contin-
ued virtuosity and the band's ability to let the
piece evolve will all combine to certainly take
it in that direction.

"I apologize for throwing my shit at you. You made it look so fun."

A dairk 'Creation' story

Charles Darwin biopic
has trouble evolving
beyond emotional
stagnancy
By CARLY STEINBERGER
For the Daily
"Creation" focuses on a lesser-
known portion of the life of Charles
Darwin, veering
away from a simply *
biographical account.
Instead of touching Cretio
on his countless zoo-
logical endeavors and At the
his development of Michigan
evolutionary theory, Newmarket
the film, based on the
novel "Annie's Box"
by Randall Keynes (Darwin's great-
great grandson), takes a more emo-
tional approach. Director Jon Amiel
chooses to highlight Darwin's struggle
to accept his own conclusions.
Throughout the film, Darwin (Paul
Bettany, "The Da Vinci Code") labors
over writing his famous work, "On the
Origin of Species," recognizing that

his theories challenge the existence of
God. While he believes his findings to
be correct, he fears them and questions
whether they should be shared with the
public. This bubbling anxiety drives
him to near insanity and physical ill-
ness. His pious wife Emma (Jennifer
Connelly, "A Beautiful Mind"), further
contributes to his doubts. All the while,
the ghost of his deceased daughter
deepens his mental instability.
The bulk of the film depicts Dar-
win's descent into madness. The
tone is initially cerebral, though that
quickly diminishes in favor of a dis-
tinctly morbid air. Advancing the dis-
mal mood is the depressing score, dark
lighting and Darwin's constant inter-
action with the imaginary. He dreams
up everything from the spirit of his
daughter to re-animated stuffed birds.
At times the film seems to teeter a bit
too much into the horror-inspired, as
eerie montages showcasing both fic-
tional and actual events flash before
Darwin's eyes, fueling his torment.
"Creation" sets itself apart from
typical, reverent biopics by attempting
to portray a true genius as someone
with human qualities and flaws. We
see Darwin as a family man who seeks
involvement in his children's lives

(though not at the climax of his mad-
ness) and is concerned for his wife's
feelings. Yet, the combination of the
writing and Bettany's performance
takes the emotions to an almost unre-
alistic level - it's as if Darwin has no
strength at all. He seems too plagued
by his insanity to ever have conceived
possibly the most revolutionary theory
in all of history.
The lack of mental progression
within the film is also disconcerting.
While Darwin grows to better handle
his anxiety, his state of mind remains
relatively stagnant. The man is still
torn between promoting his research
- which in his heart of hearts he
believes to be correct - and avoid-
ing the consequences of challenging
established religion. He even consults
his wife, and while she gives him her
opinion, it's still a bit unclear as to
whether Darwin iscompletely sold on
his own findings.
While "Creation" shows the softer
side of Darwin, it's very easy for the
viewer to forget while watching the
film the great impact of his accom-
plishments. It's almost as if the film
could be about any insanity-stricken
man and there never was an evolution
revolution.

OSCR director candidate, Wilgus,
talks vision for conflict resolution

Wilgus is first of two
candidates to visit
campus this week
ByPETER NOORANI
Daily StaffReporter
Jay Wilgus, one of two final
candidates for the position of the
director of the University's Office
of Student Conflict Resolution,
gave presentations this week for
students, members of the Univer-
sity community and Ann Arbor
residents to convey his future
hopes for OSCR if he gets the job.
The University has been search-
ing for a new director of OSCR
following the departure of for-
mer director, Jennifer Schrage in
December 2009. Monita Thomp-
son, co-director of The Program
on Intergroup Relations, has led a
search team in finding a replace-
ment.
OSCR had planned for Wilgus,
currently the assistant dean of
students at the University of Utah,
to host a student presentation on
Monday evening, but no students
attended. Yesterday morning's
public presentation in the Union's
Wolverine Room drew a crowd of
about 45 people. While many of
those in attendance were mem-

can students on campus, including
myself, and I can say confidently
that we are looking forward to the
return of our ancestor's remains to
our communities," she wrote.
She added that the status of the
"culturally unidentifiable" remains
in the University's possession has
caused a lot of tension between the
University and Native American
groups in Michigan.
"This whole situation with the
1,390 Native American human
remains in the U of M Museum
of Anthropology has caused a lot
of pain for the Native American
community; we have struggled to
see our ancestors return home for
many years," she wrote.
Despite the controversy, Univer-
sity spokeswoman Kelly Cunning-
ham said the University is aware
of the recent change in the act and
will comply with its regulations.
"We just became aware of it
(Monday), so at this point we're just
digesting what the regulations say,"
Cunningham said.

brief description of what gender-
neutral housing entails, followed
by questions that will indicate
whether or not students support
the proposal.
"We (the GNH coalition) decid-
ed to do a survey because we felt
it would be the most efficient way
to gauge the resident's feelings on
gender-neutral housing," Schmuk-
er said. "I think the survey will be
received well by students. This is
allowing residents an active role
in deciding the future of their resi-

dence halls."
LSA junior Caitlin Sadler, presi-
dent of the Residence Hall Associ-
ation, wrote in an e-mail interview
that the GNH coalition was cre-
ated by a group of RHA represen-
tatives from a number of different
student organizations and govern-
ments in order to investigate gen-

against the five named defendants.
According to the lawsuit, she is
seeking damages, costs and inter-
est in excess of $25,000 for each
charge.
One of the articles in question,
titled "In Other Ivory Towers,"
ran on page two of the Daily on
Feb. 2, 2009 and was published on
the Daily's website.
"In Other Ivory Towers" is a
short feature published weekly
in the Daily that details happen-
ings on other college campuses
using various other news outlets
as sources.
Inthe article that was published,
Rowe attributed information to an
article in The Diamondback - the
University of Maryland's student
newspaper - and two pieces from
The Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion. Graca contended in an edi-
tor's note published on the front

hers of OSCR, students and police
officers also attended the event.
After a brief introduction from
Thompson, Wilgus began his
45-minute presentation, during
which he spoke about his personal
views on conflict resolution and
outlined the challenges that he
believes OSCR and the University
as a whole face.
Wilgus, who received an honors
bachelor of science in speech com-
munication from the University of
Utah in 2001, has worked exten-
sively in conflict resolution. After
receiving his Master of Dispute
Resolution from Pepperdine Uni-
versity's Straus Institute for Dis-
pute Resolution he earned a Juris
Doctorate from the S.J. Quinney
College of Law at the University of
Utah, where he was a member of
the Utah Law Review.
Wilgus became the assistant
dean of students at the Univer-
sity of Utah in 2007, where he is
also the director of fraternity and
sorority life, a counselor with Stu-
dent Advocacy - a sub-committee
of the Dean of Students Office -
and a mediator with Community
Conflict.
Despite his law education and
work as a part-time attorney in
Salt Lake City, Wilgus said he pre-
fers his work as a mediator rather
than as a lawyer. At his presenta-

tion on Tuesday, Wilgus discussed
his theories on student conflict
resolution, and said that while
many other schools may prefer
to focus on student judiciary sys-
tems, he prefers a system of edu-
cation.
"I don't want students thinking
of OSCR as a principal's office,"
Wilgus said. "We educate and
repair harm."
Wilgus said he's in favor of
OSCR's Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities - the
code thatcgoverns student conduct
on campus - and that it can be
viewed as "students stating com-
munity norms" rather than a set of
rules set by the school's adminis-
tration.
If he secures the position of
OSCR director, Wilgus said he
hopes to create an atmosphere
that would allow Michigan stu-
dents to graduate with better con-
flict resolution skills.
"The assumption is that conflict
is unavoidable...it's how we deal
with conflict that is important,"
he said.
Wilgus said he prefers to use
the Spectrum of Conflict Resolu-
tions options, which is a guide for
students about how to make use
of OSCR's resources in resolving
conflicts - like using a mediator
- rather than taking action that

could lead to punishment. He said
if he becomes director, he'd like to
make a push to use both OSCR's
statement and the Spectrum of
Conflict Resolution Options in
order to help students deal with
conflict.
Wilgus said OSCR and the
University of Michigan lead the
nation in what he hopes will
become a revolution in student
conflict resolution. He said he's
"not interviewing this position to
maintain the status quo."
In an interview on Monday,
LSA senior Rokimas Soeharyo,
who works at OSCR, said that
much of the reason the Univer-
sity has taken a new approach to
conflict resolution stems from the
campus's diverse student body.
Wilgus alsosaid thatcthe change
is fueled by the University's wish
to provide better services and
positive learning experiences for
its students.
Will Hathaway, co-general
manager of OSCR, said after Wil-
gus's presentation on Tuesday
that he is "very articulate."
The selection process for a new
director of OSCR continues this
week. Jim Neumeister, the direc-
tor of Northwestern University's
Office of Judicial Affairs, will
speak this evening and Thursday
morning.

At last night's
meeting, MSA

of the Bay Mills Tribe, said though
she and members of other tribes
appreciate the new ruling, they feel
that the University has not always
acted in compliance with the 1990
law.
"I don't understand why U of
M's non-compliance with the spirit
and letter of this law has been over-
looked or tolerated for the last 15
years," she said.
Though Pasfield said the Uni-
versity has not met the wishes of
Native Americans in the past with
regards to the remains, she and
other members of the Native Cau-
cus were glad to see the formation
of the University's committee in the
fall, which she said will help lead a
smooth transition to the new regu-
lations.
"I'm so grateful that the repatri-
ation committee has been formed
and that the new regulations have
been announced while-the (Uni-
versity's) committee is doing their
good work," she said.
Pasfield said she feels the new
rule is indicative of the fact that
many museums - including the
University's Museum of Anthropol-
ogy - have had issues complying
with the original law.
"The fact that a 15-year tug-of-
war about regulations surround-
ing 'unidentifiable remains' has

resulted in a stronger call for their
return to a peaceful burial to me
shows how out of step obstruc-
tionist museums are in this law,"
she said.
According to a March 15 Nation-
al Park Service press release, there
are more than 124,000 "culturally
unidentifiable" Native American
human remains in museums and
exhibits across the nation. The
release stated that 4,000 individ-
ual remains have been returned to
tribes for burial.
John O'Shea, a curator at the
University's Museum ofAnthropol-
ogy and former member of a NAG-
PRA review committee, wrote in an
e-mail interview that the museum
and the University have been abid-
ing by the NAGPRA guidelines in
deciding whether or not to return
remains.
"I believe the museum does a
good job of caring for the human
remains in our collections and that
we havebeen forthrightand prompt
when claims of cultural affiliation
have been made by Native groups,"
he wrote.
According to the University's
Office of Public Affairs website,
the University has returned human
remains and other cultural objects
to the Little Traverse Bay Bands of
Odawa Indians, Little River Band

of Ottawa Indians and the White
Mountain Apache Tribe.
O'Shea wrote he thinks the addi-
tiontothe actisnotaligned withthe
original intent of NAGPRA because
under the new rules, unidentified
remains may be returned to tribes
that may not necessarily be affili-
ated with the remains.
"I think it goes well beyond the
legislative intent of the act (NAG-
PRA) in that it requires ancient
remains to be transferred to groups
that are not culturally affiliated
with the remains," he wrote.
O'Shea added that he believes
the change in the act could have
negative consequences for museum
collections nationwide.
"The new rule could result in
the complete removal of all Native
remains from all federally-funded
museums in the U.S.," he wrote.
O'Shea wrote that if Native
American remains were removed'
from museums, researchers would
only be able to study remains from
past populations from Europe, Asia
and Africa and wouldn't be able to
make new discoveries about North
American populations.
The new regulation will go
into effect on May 14, 2010, with a
60-day period for citizens to com-
ment on the rule on the national
NAGPRA website.
prove useful.
Schumker said advocates of the
proposal still aren't exactly sure
how the logistics might work, but
that it's still important to get stu-
dents' feedback on it to figure out
the best way to move forward.
"We're not sure how gender-
neutral housing might be struc-
tured at Michigan, and how
students would apply for it,"
Schumker said. "Those are details
that are still being explored by
representatives from (the) Spec-
trum Center, Housing and ulti-
mately RHA, too."
Nonetheless, the survey should
prove helpful in discovering the
wants and concerns of students
living in residence halls.
"The responses of the survey
will help inform subsequent dis-
cussions with student groups and
Housing administration," Shmuk-
er said, "and we hope will direct
further dialogue with the campus
community."

the number of hours that were
put into its development. The
money for the website, he said,
was taken out of the assembly's
2009 fall payroll budget.
"The time sheets were not
available to me," Mahanti said at
the meeting. "It was a question
away, and I neglected to ask the
question and find out how much
I was spending."
MSA's current website was
created free of charge by an
MSA Engineering Rep. Kyle
Summers. The old website was
thrown away because it would
have cost MSA more money to
fix it than to start over.
In the last week, University
students have criticized the
Michigan Vision Party in con-
nection with Mahanti's mis-
management of the website.
Mahanti ran for president on the
MVP slate, though he has since
disaffiliated himself with the
party.
At last night's meeting, Mah-
anti said he is not tied to MVP
and that his actions are not rep-
resentative of the party mem-
bers as a whole.
Jim Brusstar, MSA student
general councel representative,
has taken over the project and
will seek input from other MSA
representatives, specifically
Summers, who Brusstar said has
"technical expertise."
Representatives will work on
revamping the website free of
charge - since no MS rep -
sentative can be paid for labor
that is for the assembly.
Randy Yao, a computer sci-
S ehe engineer and a former
designer of the website, said in
an interview after the meeting
that he put in the most hours out
of the three students who spent
time developing the website.
According to a payroll expense
form, Yao received $2,933 for
working on the website for 209.5
hours.
"We weren't really aware
of what the budget was at the
time," Yao said. "We lost track of
the money that was spent."
Yao added that the situation
should be blamed on the mis-
communication between the
parties involved.
"I think it was a communica-

tion break down between (the
other designers) and Abhishek
(Mahanti)," he said. "The blame
does not fall on any one indi-
vidual. It really kind of falls on
the communication over the big
picture."
He added that he thinks it is
unfortunate the issue wasn't
resolved until it was "too late."
Yao said the whole project was
supposed to cut costs by adding
a feature on the website where
the MSA representatives could
revise the site if there were mis-
takes or announcements to be
added.
Architecture graduate stu-
dent Andrew McIntyre, another
designer that was involved with
website development through
a work-study program, said the
project was too extensive for his
experience in website design.
McIntyre said he asked Mah-
anti to hire two more designers
to help develop the website, as a
result of his inexperience.
"(The website) needed more
than I could give," McIntyre
said.
McIntyre received $543.60
for spending 43.3 hours working
on the website, according to the
payroll expense sheet.
McIntrye said the money that
was spent on developing the
website was unnecessary for the
type of website that MSA was
trying to create.
"$9,000 is probably a third of
what you would pay for a pro-
fessional website, and they got
a third of the. wesite," be saidj,
adding that a student govern-
ment doesn't need a "profession-
al website."
McIntyre also said that the
estimated $3,000 budget was
"misconstrued" because none of
the designers were informed of
the budget.
McIntyre added that Mah-
anti had the information and
timesheets all along.
"Abhishek (Mahanti) knew
what I was working on and what
I was producing, and he had
access to the number of hours I
was working on," he said. "Our
hours were not directly reported
to him, but he could've found out
if he wanted to."

der-neutral housing options.
"RHA is interested in finding
out how students feel about this
issue in order to make the best
decision for all residents," Sadler
said. "The proposal that comes
from the Gender Neutral Housing
Working Group will depend large-
ly on the information received
from the survey."
Sadler added that the results of
the survey will help RHA to figure
out the next steps in the process.
"This feedback will provide
RHA with more information about
how residents actually feel about
this issue and will allow this pro-
cess of exploring gender neutral
housing options to move forward,"
she wrote.
Spectrum Center Director
Jackie Simpson told the Daily in
October that while she was hope-
ful about reworking the gender-
neutral housing option, she was
unsure how quickly the process
would be able to move along, if at
page of the Daily on March 5 that
Rowe plagiarized the sources.
"While this particular piece
cited these three sources, it inap-
propriately took complete sen-
tences and phrases verbatim from
them without using quotes. This
implied the material was para-
phrased when, in fact, it was not,"
Graca wrote at the time.
In the lawsuit, Rowe and her
attorney claim the article was not
plagiarized because she attributed
the information to the sources and
never claimed them as her own.
"At no time was there any per-
sonal offering by Julie Rowe: the
column is as it states, a reprinting
of other publications," the plain-
tiff's lawyer wrote in the sum-
mons and complaint.
Contacted by the Daily on Mon-
day, Rowe declined to comment on
the litigation, referring all ques-
tions to her attorney.

Mich.-based attorney represent-
ing Rowe, said in an interview

all.
However, in an interview last
month, Simpson said she was glad
that RHA has been taking a look at
the gender-neutral housing option
within the residence halls.
"It is important to listen to
students' concerns and evaluate
whether or not their concerns
are viable for the campus at this
time," said Simpson. "The fact
that students are the ones tak-
ing leadership and responsibil-
ity for gathering the information
needed in this area and ulti-
mately identifying recommenda-
tions to the campus community
is what makes Michigan students
unique. Students are the best
indicators and evaluators of what
they need."
In addition, Simpson said that
RHA is the place where students
can voice their concerns about the
residence halls and said she feels
the collaboration between the
Spectrum Center and RHA will


IFC
From Page 1A
according to Miniaci.
According to the IFC's Social
Environment Management Poli-
cy, which states the rules fraterni-
ties are supposed to follow when
hosting social functions, IFC
fraternities are allowed to hold
events Tuesday through Satur-
day as long as they are of a certain
size. Events can only be regis-
tered between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.,
and the size of events allowed
during those days is divided into
different tiers that range from 50
guests to 200 guests.
If a fraternity has an event that
isn't registered prior to taking
place, it is subject to social pro-
bation, the maximum sanction
of which is six weeks of social
probation, Miniaci wrote in the
e-mail interview.
Miniaci wrote that IFC's
Social Responsibility Commit-
tee will be "on rounds" tonight to
look for the possibility of unreg-
istered events. He added that he
spoke with Sigma Pi's president
and was informed that the frater-
nity will not be hosting the event
at night, though according to a

Facebook event, the fraternity
has an event planned during the
day today.
"If they are found by SRC to be
having an event when SRC is on
rounds, they will likely be sanc-
tioned for six weeks of social pro-
bation," Miniaci wrote.
Sigma Pi's party will end by
10 p.m., and thus didn't register
the 'event with IFC, Sigma Pi
president Glen Mitas wrote in
an e-mail interview last night.
The Facebook event previously
stated that the party would last
until Thursday morning at 3
a.m., but according to Mitas, that
was "nothing more than a mere
typo."
"Our event tomorrow is a social
gathering that will occur only
during the daytime," Mitas wrote.
"...We, Sigma Pi Fraternity, are in
full compliance with the IFC's
social responsibility policies."
This past Saturday, also known
as "St. Practice Day," three IFC
fraternities registered events
during the evening, according to
Miniaci. Other fraternities that
hosted events during the day
weren't regulated by the SRC
since the committee can't "logis-
tically regulate events during the
day," he wrote.


yesterday that he believed Rowe
was "wrongly forced into a resig-
nation" after she was accused of
plagiarizing. Butler said he thinks
the case will ultimately be decided
based on what is determined to be
the definition of plagiarism.
"I looked at the dictionary for
the definition of plagiarism and
it said something to the effect of
'presenting one's work as its own,'
" Butler said in a phone interview.
"I've read the article and the
whole scope of the article is that
it's addressing and attributing the
information, the comments, to
the various other campus papers.
At no time did I ever interpret
that as saying that it was her own
work."
Graca and Ratkowiak were con-
tacted Monday about the lawsuit,
but they declined to comment on
the allegations.
Smilovitz also declined to com-
ment on Monday.
"Because it is a litigation mat-
ter, right now, I have been asked

by our lawyers not to comment at
this time," Smilovitz said, add-
ing that he was speaking both as
an individual named in the suit
and as the representative for the
Daily.
Herschel Fink, a Detroit-based
attorney representing the Daily,
Graca, Ratkowiak and Smilovitz,
declined to comment on the alle-
gations in the lawsuit when inter-
viewed yesterday. However, he
said, "we'll defend it vigorously."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald told the Daily on Mon-
day he would not comment on the
allegations.
"It's unfortunate that this dis-
agreement has occurred," Fitzger-
ald said. "But, we certainty hope
for a quick and appropriate resolu-
tion."

ICE HOCKEY
A statistical mystery of
Michigan goaltending

0

Bryan Hogan should know a
little bit about how Shawn
Hunwick is feeling right
now.
No, Hogan never earned the
timeless "Rudy"
moniker that
Michigan coach
Red Berenson
has bestowed
upon Hunwick
in light of the
junior walk-
on goalie's 5-1i RYAN
record thus far KARTJE
as a Wolverine.
And Hogan,
unlike Hunwick, had started a col-
legiate hockey game before he took
over for Billy Sauer as the starter in
goal last season. Hunwick, on the
other hand, had little more than
garbage time experience before
Hogan's injury two weeks ago.
But the Hogan of last season and
the Hunwick of this season look
nearly identical on the stat sheet
thus far.
And despite both of their valiant
performances, most of that statis-
tical wonder has little to do with
their own performances between
the pipes.
Instead, it has everything to do
with how the Wolverines played
around them.
In the six games after Hogan
took over for Sauer on Dec. 5, 2008
against Michigan State, Michigan
scored a staggering 30 goals, aver-
aging five goals per game.
In the same period of time this
season, the offense surrounding
Hunwick has registered 28 goals,
which amounts to 4.5 goals per
game. Another staggeringnumber.
For perspective's sake, that
number would be good enough for
tops in the NCAA in either year - a
goal or half-goal in both cases.
To be fair, this year's offense
wasn't exactly reeling before Hun-
wick stood tall in net, lighting the
lamp an average of 3.2 times per
game. Today, that number would

Injuries and position changes:
One important storyline for Michi-
gan in its preparation for the 2010
season is how a few key Wolverines
bounce back from serious injuries.
Sophomore running back Vin-
cent Smith (torn ACL), junior
defensive tackle Mike Martin
(shoulder) and redshirt junior cen-
ter David Molk (torn ACL) will
miss all of spring practice due to
injuries.
Redshirt junior wide receiver
Junior Hemingway and redshirt
junior linebacker Brandon Herron
will miss part of the spring prac-
tices.
Aside from injuries, there are a
few early position changes to note.
Redshirt freshman Cameron Gor-
don was moved from receiver to
safety and sophomore Teric Jones
was kept at safety instead of being
moved back to offense to create
some depth in the defensive back-
field.
Position versatility will also be
important on both sides of the ball.
Rodriguez said some of the slot
receivers could see time at running
back and that both fifth-year senior
Greg Banks and redshirt junior
Ryan Van Bergen will play both
defensive end and tackle.
Senior Troy Woolfolk and red-
shirt freshman Justin Turner
could also play multiple positions
at the back end of the defense.
Both will primarily play corner-
back, but Rodriguez said the two
could play a little bit at safety as
well.
NOTES: Rodriguez said redshirt ;
senior Nick Sheridan has "retired
from football" and hopes to enter
the coaching profession. Sheri-
dan is not allowed to work with
the Wolverines now because he's
still a student. ... This past Satur-
day, Michigan held a 40-yard dash
sprint race among teammates.
Fifth-year senior Adam Patterson
won the 270-pound-plus division
and junior Martavious Odoms won
the faster heat, barely beating Rob-
inson.

SOFTBALL
Viefhaus and Findlay embrace
role as Blue's captains this year

40

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Every.time the Michigan soft-
ball team takes the field, it takes a
little bit of the past with it.
With six seniors heading this
year's squad, the experienced
Wolverines have plenty of games
under their belts. The leaders of
the team- senior captains Angela
Findlay and Maggie Viefhaus -
believe that remembering the past
is important. That way they will be
able to learn from every situation,
good or bad.
"It's crazy being a senior,
because you feel like you've liter-
ally gone through it all," Viefhaus
said. "You've hit rock bottom,
you've hit your peaks, and you
can only get better and learn from
those experiences. You can't dwell
on them. I think that's what I've
improved on most, just moving on.
If something doesn't go my way, I
move on from it. I try and find posi-
tives out of everythingI do."
Findlay and Viefhaus know
that their position on the team is
slightly different from the rest of
the upperclassmen. While their
biggest job is to help the rest of the
team improve as a whole, the two
captains must also be the ones to
discuss any issues that arise dur-
ing the season. The captains are

aware of the difficulty that lies
in addressing a four-year starter
about their mental or physical
preparations.
"Obviously it's a big honor to be
captain," Findlay said. "I mean,
you come into a school that has had
a lot of success, especially in soft-
ball. But it's also a huge responsi-
bility. You have tobe someone that
is willing to tell your teammates
things that maybe they don't want
to hear, and also be able to tell
yourself that."
But the duo knows the special
role to which their teammates
have elected them and aspire to
set the tone for the team, starting
with their focus and motivation at
practice.
"That's the challenge that Ilove,
that even when you don't feel your
greatest, you still have to perform
to the best of your ability because
your teammates are looking up to
you," Viefhaus said. "I love to be
able to come through for my team,
to play for Michigan, to play for my
teammates."
The two captains have translat-
ed their leadership into game-time
performance as well. Viefhaus
- the third baseman - leads the
team at the plate, hitting .368.
Findlay, the right-fielder, is close
behind, batting .324. And together,
the duo has started all 22 games for

the Wolverines this season, driv-
ing in a combined 40 RBI thus far.
After losing to Georgia in
game three of the Women's Col-
lege World Series last season,
this year's Michigan squad wants
an improved postseason perfor-
mance. But the veteran Wolver-
ines know that they must take it
one game at a time, taking care
of business in their difficult non-
conference and Big Ten schedules
before they can look ahead to the
postseason.
Even in its current 10-game
win streak, the Michigan captains
refuse to let the team take any-
thing for granted.
They remember their past three
seasons as Wolverines, and know
that until the last out is recorded,
anything can happen.
"The biggest thing that I've
learned throughout the time I've
been here is that anybody can beat
anyone on any given day," Findlay
said. "We've had some really good
teams here who have lost to teams
that on paper weren't nearly as
good as we were. But I've learned
that you need to go out there and
treat every opponent the same.
You can't take any day for grant-
ed, not practice, games, not any-
thing. You've just really got to go
out there every day and focus, one
pitch at a time."

ANOTHER KIND OF VACATIC
BY BEN CRONIN

During spring break, I traveled to
New Orleans with a group of 17
students - including Michigan
football players Craig Roh and Jordan
Reilly - from Young Life College, a
student faith organization at the Uni-
versity, to help families displaced by
Hurricane Katrina. Though it may seem
like the hurricane is a thing of the past,
there was still a lot of work to be done.
After cramming our luggage into the
backoffour vans, we began our 16-hour
trip to Louisiana. In an attempt to get
acclimated to the Southern culture,
Craig, Jordan and I bought black cow-
bq hats during a stopover in Nashville
and listened to country music the entire
way.
While in New Orleans, we stayed in a
village run by the Presbyterian Disaster
Assistance, an organization that coor-
dinates relief efforts in New Orleans.
Though three other groups were staying
there also - about 65 total people - we
only had four showers and a few toilets.

After watching an orientation video
on our first full day, the group couldn't
wait to get into the field to work. Dur-
ing the film, one of our group members
noticed there were numbers and big X's
spray painted on the doors of homes
damaged by the storm.
We learned that after the hurricane,
relief workers from the National Guard
and the local forces placed an empha-
sis on saving those still alive, and if a
dead body was found in a house, the
rescuers would mark it with a large X
and the number of dead bodies found
inside so they could be picked up later.
It was tough hearing that, to think of
the people who had no idea if their fam-
ily members were alive or dead, because
their bodies had not yet been identified.
That first day, we began work at a
house in the 17th Ward. The outside of
the house looked decent, but the inside
was a wreck. I started by putting up side
paneling on part of the house, and then
we tore down interior walls and put up

random student interview

Heliot
Hi. Is this Chris [last name
redacted]?
Yes. This is Chris.
Hi, this is Dani and I'm calling
from The Michigan Daily for the
Random Student Interview. I was
wondering if you could talk to me
for a little bit.
Yeah, that'd be fine.
Are you excited that it's so nice
outside?
Oh, hell yeah. I've been wearing
shorts and a T-shirt outside.
That's a little bit overenthusias-
tic. It's not that warm.
No, this is great. I just like warm.
Why are you in Michigan then?
Born here and I just haven't left yet.
[Laughs] Good answer. So, sum-
mer is coming soon. You have any
exciting plans? Job?
I got a cool job in Ann Arbor, work-
ing with [company name redacted].
So that'll be good. It's political. I'm
a PoliSci major. So it's right up my
alley.
That's really exciting. I'm happy

for you Chris.
Thank you. Even though you don't
really know me. I'm glad you're
happy for me.
What's with the dog? In your
Facebook profile picture?
Oh, my dog, Angel.
The one with the devil tail and the
horns?
Oh God.
[Laughs]
It was, like, Pokdmon Profile Picture
month. That's what that is. I'm kinda
a nerd. But everyone likes some
dorky things.
I know, like, Lord of the Rings.
Oh. Badass.
Who doesn't like Lord of the
Rings? And I'm not just talking
about the movies, but people who
read the books, like, they gotta
like it.
I'm gonna tell you something, some
people might think it's kinda dorky,
but I read the books when I was 12.
Oh my God. Same here.
Oh, we have so much in common.
We really do have so much in com-

mon. I have to move on though
cause my editor isn't going to
want to print a five minute con-
versation about Lord of the Rings.
Well, we can move on to Harry Pot-
ter.
Harry Potter is different. People
love comparing the two. But you
can't really compare the two.
They're so different.
They're different fantasy types.
Yeah, and Harry Potter is, like,
about Harry Potter. But Lord of
the Rings is about all of Middle
Earth...
It's a whole epic; it's a whole epic
story. Mmm hmm.
So do you like "The OC"?
Oh, yeah, I still ... I watched every
episode when I was in high school.
Oh my God. But, season one was
just this pinnacle of brilliance
that they never reached again.
Yeah. It just never quite came ... it
was close but it was never coming
back.
I'm really familiar with seasons
one and two 'cause I have them on

DVD, but seasons three and four I
only saw once. So let's just keep it
to seasons one and two...
I don't remember that much about
any of them 'cause I've only seen all
of them once. But my high school
girlfriend made me watch all of them
with her.
What's your favorite scene? Do
you have one that sticks out in
your mind? Like, did you cry when
Ryan had to leave at the end of
season one? Or was it just so awe-
some when Summer and Seth had
that kiss in the rain? The Spider-
man kiss.
I got a little teary-eyed when you
brought up the Ryan leaving. [Pause]
But my favorite scene probably
involves Seth because he was hilari-
ous.
Seth and Summer: one of the
greatest TV couples ever.
Oh my God, so dramatic, so funny, so
good together.

Two and a half
years ago, Zazove received a cochlear implant -
a surgically implanted device in the ear that helps
pick up sound. Since the implant, Zazove said
more of his patients are making the connection
that he's deaf.
Though the device is supposed to improve
hearing, Zazove said his doesn't work very well.
A year and half ago, he got a second implant
which has slightly improved his hearing.
"It works better, and it's only getting better,
but it's not what I had hoped," he said.
Instead, Zazove relies heavily on lip reading to
converse with his patients and others in his life.
He said people who lip read can only understand
about 20 percent of what someone is saying, and
must rely on context to fill in the rest.
"I know we're talking about me, my life," he
said of our conversation at an interview last
month. "If we were talking about Dick Cheney
paying his rent, and you didn't tell me that, I'd
probably have no idea. It would take me a while
to figure that out."
Zazove noted that lip reading comes in handy
when communicating with patients who have
lost their voice from being sick or after coming
out of surgery. "I can read their lips, and other
people can't understand them," he said.
While lip reading may help him communicate
with patients, it becomes a problem during sur-
gery when doctors wear surgical masks.
"It's hard," he said. "People are talking, and
you have no idea what they're saying."
Zazove admitted this was an issue while learn-
ing how to perform surgeries in medical school.
To make up for the lack of auditory learning, he
would have to ask many questions and pay extra
attention.
Today, Zazove is working with the Association
of Medical Professionals with Hearing Losses to
develop a clear mask that allojws deaf doctors and
patients to read lips.
The mask is just starting to be adapted by pro-
fessionals in the medical field, and Zazove said it
will make work easier for future generations of
deaf physicians.

said. "It's amazing, it really is, what people can
do."
Despite his hearing loss, Zazove said patients
rarely express concern about his diagnoses.
"Most people figure if you're an M.D. and you
went through med school and residency and are
certified, you know what you're doing," he said.
In some cases, his deafness helps establish bet-
ter relationships with his patients. Zazove said he
thinks his disability may inadvertently lead him
to providing better patient care.
"I would be willing to bet as a general rule that
deaf physicians are much more attentive to their
patients. They have to be to focus," he said. "Peo-
ple tell me that all the time, 'I love the way you
look at me and listen to me."'
Joyce Kaferle, the medical director in the
Department of Family Medicine, has worked
with Zazove since the early 1990s. She said she
has found his hearing loss helps him better con-
nect with patients.
"I think that it's really an invaluable thing for
his deaf patients because he understands what
they're going through a lot more than other peo-
ple do," Kaferle said.
However, Kaferle said Zazove's patient care
time has become limited due to the amount of
administrative work he has taken on.
Zazove is one of 25 professionals in the coun-
try who conduct research on how hearing loss
impacts health. Results from Zazove's studies
may be used in the future to help the deaf have a
better quality of life.
Through his research, Zazove discovered peo-
ple with even a slight hearing loss tend to have
poorer health. He has yet to determine why, but
he attributes the discovery to the fact that hear-
ing doctors treat patients with hearing loss dif-
ferently.
In 1994, Zazove published an autobiography
"When the Phone Rings, My Bed Shakes." His
second book, out this month, is titled "Four Days
in Michigan." While the book is classified as fic-
tion, the story describes the differences between
people in the "deaf" and "Deaf" communities.

Zazove explained that people born with a
profound hearing loss are considered "deaf" -
lower-case "d" - and often keep quiet about their
disability, while people in the "Deaf" community
- upper-case "D" - communicate by sign lan-
guage and embrace their hearing loss. According
to Zazove, the "Deaf" community views him as
"deaf" because he can hear slightly.
"From a Deaf person's perspective, normal is
deaf. Abnormal is hearing," Zazove said.
This is also the group that makes less than
$25,000 per year. For that reason, Zazove said
few people in the Deaf community live in Ann
Arbor because the cost of living in the city is too
high.
"They can't afford to live here. It's too expen-
sive," Zazove said. "Most of them live in Flint, or
Detroit, or Grand Rapids or small towns where
it's cheap. I would say there's probably 30 or SO
people in the Deaf community in Washtenaw
County here for that reason."
As far as students, Zazove said there may be
a total of three to 15 students with a hearing
loss who attend the University every year. The
Office for Students with Disabilities helps them
as much as possible by providing interpreters
to take notes during classes and translate lec-
tures.
Though this may make a difference in deaf
students' educational experiences, they still
face challenges outside the classroom. Zazove
explained how being deaf is a difficult disability
to have because it's not visible.
Using a hypothetical situation, he said if stu-
dents are at party and a blind student walked
in, most people would go over and help him or
her. But if it was the same party and a deaf stu-
dent walked in, no one would know the student
was deaf and no one would offer assistance.
Zazove says scenarios like this have happened
often in his career. He mentioned one instance
last month where, after leading a medical confer-
ence, a man wearing a surgical mask due to ill-
ness approached Zazove.
"He came up to me said 'You did a good job
moving this along' and left," Zazove said. "I had
no idea what he said. Somebody who knew me
said, 'I bet you didn't understand him,' I said no,
and he told me what (the man had) said."
From these experiences, Zazove understands
why some people keep quiet about their deafness.
"I think that's why people with hearing loss
would finally give up and say I don't want any-
body to know, it's too much trouble, it doesn't
change anything anyway," he said.
Yet, despite the myriad bumps and setbacks,
Zazove has learned to live with his disability
and embrace life regardless of his existence in a
silent world. Reed said her husband's deafness is
a characteristic that makes him so special.
"He's a very beloved physician," Reed noted.
"He has a loyal patient clientele who stick with
him year in and year out. So while I do think it
was difficult for him to become a physician, he's
a great example that deaf individuals can do all
kinds of professional jobs very well."

news in review

Five of the most talked-about stories of the week, ranked in ascending order of actual importance
F

Katie Spotz, 22, became the young-
est person in history and the first
American to row the entire Atlantic
Ocean solo. She ended her trip in
Georgetown, Guyana on Sunday
after 70 days, 5 hours and 22 min-
utes in a 19-foot rowboat.

Nancy Pelosi announced she may
attempt to pass the health care bill
slated for voting this week through
"self-executing rule." The tactic
would negate the need for a vote,
though it hasn't been used on some-
thing as large as the $875 billion bill.

When doctors deliver babies, most of
them can hear the first life-affirm-
ing cries of the infants as theyenter
the world.
Dr. Philip Zazove can't.
In 1981, Dr. Philip Zazove became the third
certified deaf physician in the history of the
United States. Now a specialist in family medi-
cine at the University Hospital, he has spent
more than 30 years in the medical field.
When asked why he chose medicine, Zazove
replied, "I like to help people. I like medicine. I
like relationships with people."
But obtaining his dream job was no easy task.
Now58, Zazove was diagnosed with profound
hearing loss at age four. Though Zazove can't
pinpoint the exact moment he lost his hearing,
he recalls the frustration he felt when he couldn't
hear what his father was saying as he helped him
organize books on a shelf one day.
"I said, 'Daddy, you have to turn around so I
can see you, so I can understand you,' " Zazove
recalls. Zazove could only understand his father
by reading his lips, a task that could not be
achieved when his father's back was turned to
him.

The Zazoves recognized something was
wrong with their son and took him to doctors
who evaluated him and diagnosed his deafness.
"They said I had a profound loss, and I would
never be educatable," Zazove said. "And I should
go to a deaf school, and I would be lucky if I got a
job as a janitor."
But because Zazove had already learned to
speak English before losing his hearing, his situ-
ation differed from children born deaf who have
never learned to speak.
Rather than placing him in a school for the
deaf, the Zazoves decided to "mainstream" their
son and educate him in public schools. Zazove
says he was the first deaf child to be main-
streamed in the northern Chicago suburbs.
But school administrators met this decision
with opposition. Every year, Zazove's teachers
would try to convince his parents to send him to
a deaf school.
"Even though I did very well the year before,
the teacherwould say, 'A deaf child? I can't have
one of those,' " Zazove said.
According to Zazove, the majority of deaf peo-
ple cannot read above a sixth grade level, while
only 13 percent graduate from college.

Yet, Zazove defied the odds and attended
Northwestern University in 1969. .
When it came time to apply for medical school,
Zazove remained optimistic.
But despite stellar grades, high medical board
scores and gushing recommendations, all 18
medical schools he applied to denied him accep-
tance.
While none of the letters openly stated that
the school would not accept him because of his
deafness, Zazove knew that was the underlying
reason.
Despite the setbacks, he didn't allow his dis-
ability to stop him.
Zazove put off medical school and remained
at Northwestern to obtain his master's degree.
When his program was finished he decided to
give medical school another shot, and this time
applied to nearly 30 schools.
During the application process, a second-year
medical student at Rutgers University - one of
the schools Zazove applied to - heard about
Zazove. The student himself had a profound
hearing loss and decided to help by setting up an
interview with representatives from Rutgers.
Today, Zazove doesn't know if that made a

difference, but Rutgers was the only school to
accept him.
After two years at Rutgers, Zazove transferred
to Washington University in St. Louis, where he
met his wife, Barb Reed, who was studying pedi-
atrics at the time. She is now a physician in the
Department of Family Medicine in the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System.
Reed emphasized what an "excellent" father
her husband is and that his hearing loss never
stopped him from caring for his daughters Katie,
now 26, and Rebecca, now 28.
The family came to Michigan in 1989. Both
Reed and Zazove got jobs at UMHS in the
Department of Family Medicine, making Zazove
the first deaf physician to work in the state of
Michigan.
As is the nature of family medicine, Zazove
forms close relationships with his patients and
their families.
"The thing about family medicine is taking
care of family, continuity of care and prevention
and keeping people from getting sick," Zazove
said.
Zazove cares for about 2,500 patients at the
hospital, of which roughly 10 percent have a

I: FTRE OF A

by EMILY ORLEY

our years ago, Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje built a fully
functioning house entirely off the electric grid. Hieftje
designed and built the house, which runs on a solar energy
w system, on Lake Superior with his father-in-law. It includes
all the fundamentals of a normal home - a refrigerator,
washer, dryer and dishwasher - and is completely self-contained.
And according to Hieftje, he's never had a single problem with it.
Hieftje's effort to reduce his carbon footprint is just a small
step compared to the enormous strides he has made for the city of
Ann Arbor. In 2005, the mayor challenged the city to, by the end
of 2010, obtain 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources
and to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent.

His plan was inspired by the windmill
farms in Sault Saint Marie, Ontario,
just north of the Upper Peninsula.
Unfortunately, Hieftje said, Michigan
doesn't have strong enough winds to
power farms of its own, but it does have
two hydro-dams and a landfill gas energy
system, both of which have enabled cities
across the state to increase alternative
energy usage.
By the end of 2009, 16 percent of the
total energy used by the city of Ann
Arbor - including fuel, heating, lighting
and electricity - was generated from
renewable sources - the equivalent of
taking 400 cars off the road last year.
The number is still far from the
mayor's goal of 30 percent, though he
maintains the city will still make up the
14 percent by the end of this year. "We're
going to do it," he says when asked about
making the target.
Though almost doubling the city's
use of renewable energy in just one year
seems unlikely, if anyone is going to
get Ann Arbor to that goal it's Hieftje,
who has made green energy a focus of
his administration from the start. And
even if the city doesn't make it to 30
percent by 2010, the progress the mayor
has made has helped mold Ann Arbor
into a national leader in environmental
practices.
Hieftje's plan stems from his
personal life. Before setting
/ the challenge in 2005, the
mayor and his team made
sm.:: changes, any little thing they could
to make Ann Arbor a greener place. This
proactive work has helped accelerate
Hieftje's goal.
"Because we'd been doing this for so
long," Hieftje said, "by the time I made
the challenge in 2005 we'd already done
all the easy energy savings."
The mayor has been cognizant of
changing all the buses in the city to.

hydro-buses. And while he won't
decommission a perfectly good bus,
he does ensure that when a bus's life
is over, it's replaced with a hydro-bus.
The city has even begun to obtain
hydro-bucket trucks to fix streetlights,
which require substantially less energy
when operating.
"I want Ann Arbor to be
an environmentally focused,
technologically focused, innovative
kind of city that is a place with a high
quality of life where people want to
live," Hieftje said.
Last year, Ann Arbor
ranked sixteenth in the U.S.
Environmental Protection
Agency's list of on-site green
power producers in the
agency's Green Gower Partnership
list. The program acknowledges
organizations that have made the most
resourceful green power purchases.
Ann Arbor was recognized for its
use of biogas, small-hydro power
and solar power. During the summer
months, city biofuel vehicles obtain SO
percent of their energy from bio diesel.
Additionally, the EPA recognized the
mayor's efforts to replace city street
lighting with LED lights.
Ann Arbor is the leading city in the
United States in terms of using LED
streetlights. The downtown area is
almost completely converted at this
point and changes have begun in
neighboring districts. However, the
mayor and his team have faced an
imposing obstacle - 5,000 of the 7,000
lights in Ann Arbor are owned by DTE
energy. This means thatthe city cannot
change the lights to LED without the
company's consent. And while the city
has successfully changed the other
2,000, the push has been met with
resistance from DTE.
"We're going to do everything we

can," Hieftje said. "We're going to be
at 100 percent but we can't affect the
other 5,000 unless we can get them to
agree to be partners with us."
The LEDlightsthe cityhasinstalled,
however, have been remarkably
effective - both environmentally and
economically. The installations have
cost the city $630,000. Predictions
initially projected the investment
would be paid off in approximately five
years. However, researchers from the
Ross School of Business studied the
proposal and determined that the city
would be paid back in about 3.8 years.
"They came back and told us how
productive it is going to be and, from
our point of view, if we can make an
investment that pays itself back in four
years and then forever with energy
savings, we're going to go for it," Hieftje
said. The mayor is so enthusiastic about
LED lights that there is even an LED lit
conference room in city hall.
The bulbs in LED lights last almost
10 years compared to the two-year
lifespan of a normal bulb, and the
bulbs have many capabilities that
are currently being tested. Research
is being done to provide a dimming
feature to the system. This would
reduce the amount of power being used
but would still allow the bulbs to emit
quite a bit of light because of the high
brightness wavelengths released.
Additionally, the mayor and histeam
are trying to formulate a way the lights
can be used for safety. One potential
idea is that each light post in the
city would be hooked into a grid and
assigned a specific number. If someone
placed a call to 911, the operator
could input the caller's location and
flash specific lights to help guide the
ambulance to the victim.
These LED lights could also be
used to light new parking structures
around the city. During night hours,
the parking structure would be dark
to conserve electricity. However, as
motion is sensed, the lights will begin
to turn on in front of you. The lights
will remain on for fifteen minutes after
the motion stops and then begin to
turn off in the same sequence.
"We already expect these (lights)
to last a long time and if we cannot
run them at full power they'll last even
longer," said Andrew Brix, energy
programs manager for the city of Ann
Arbor.
With the increased safety of
residents, the decreased usage of
electricity and the financial savings,

the LED lights appear to be an infallible
option. The University, however, has
decided not to get on board the LED
wagon. Despite the Business School's
excellent productivity results, the
University has not voiced its desire to
make the change to LED.
"We shared what we're doing with
them but they decided it doesn't make
sense for them to do yet, which I don't
understand," Brix said.
LED lights are simply
one phase in a much
bigger plan the mayor
p has for the city. There
is currently agrant put
in place in which businesses can apply for
an energy audit. People can apply for up
to $20,000 to renovate their building to
be more energy efficient. Soon, the mayor
hopes, the plan will be able to expand
to residential areas and help people
restructure their homes.
The program will work like an energy
bank. The city will give people money
to make their buildings or homes more
energy efficient, and the monetary
savings over time will be given back
to the city until the loan is, paid off.
Essentially, once the program is in full
bloom, the money will just be recycled to
continue to help the city.
The largest goal on Hieftje's checklist,
however, is reducing the necessity of
landfills. While his current goal is for Ann
Arbor to be at30 percent renewable energy
bytheendof2010,themayorfirmlybelieves
that someday the city will be completely
sustainable on renewable energy.
But in a society where the average
American has about 1,500 pounds of
trash per year, eliminating landfills
seems unrealistic. So instead, Hieftje and
his team have created a way to actually
recycle the gases being emitted from
landfills. "If you're going to produce all
this animal waste, is there a way to use
it to produce energy?" Hieftje recalls
asking himself a while back.
And there is. When garbage breaks
down in landfills, it creates methane. The
key was to develop a way to tap into that
gas to turn it into energy.
The major landfills in Ann Arbor have
machines that trap the gases and then
convert them into energy. Not only does
this help to produce alternative forms
of energy, it protects the environment.
The machine captures 99 percent of
methane emissions that would normally
be released into the atmosphere.
"We're taking what could be a very
harmful thing for the atmosphere and
turning it into energy," Hieftje said.

In2008, the machines recaptured
over 31,000 metric tons of CO2,
the equivalent of about 6,000 cars'
emissions being recaptured. While
Ann Arbor didn't invent this system,
it was one of the first communities to
adopt the technology. And the program
is a win-win because it is generating
energy while saving the city over
$20,000 ayear.
"We're trying to mitigate the
effects," Hieftje said of the city's
landfills. "Our efforts are going to save
us money in the long run. I don't see
how people can argue with that."
The United States is responsible
for about a fourth of the world's
greenhouse gases. Even though the
acceleration rate of greenhouse gas
emissions has slowed as a result of the
recession, it by no means has begun to
decrease. And while the best thing a
person can do for the environment is
to conserve energy by not burning it in
the first place, the next best option is to
recycle the energy that must be burned.
The mayor has designed and
begun to initiate a new single-source
recycling program for all Ann Arbor
residents, including students that live
off-campus. The plan is to provide
residents a bin to fill with any waste
products that aren't trash. The city will
then pick up the contents of the bin and
sort them so they can be recycled.
This program can dramatically
increase the volume and variety of
recycled materials collected, as most
choose to just throw away items rather
than sort them into proper recycling
groups.
"The planet should be working
toward not having any more landfills
and that's the direction we're going
in," Hieftje said. "We don't want any
more landfills or to pay to put our trash
in landfills."
And the mayor is truly optimistic
about his plans. While his goals are
lofty and possibly unattainable in
the near future, he hopes that in time
people will drastically alter the way
they dispose of waste.
"My goal would be that people would
be putting a lot more in the bin than in
the trash so they'd have a big recycling
cart and asmall trash cart," he said.
One of the most crucial
components to reducing
greenhouse gases in
the city, however, is the
use of solar energy. Ann
Arbor fire stations and city swimming
pools run entirely on solar hot water
heat, and the Ann Arbor Farmers
Market is powered exclusively by solar
panels.
Unobtrusive green panels were
installed on the rooftop of the market
in June 2008. The project, which
cost about $100,000, supplements
approximately $1,500 in electricity
per year. The panels collect DC energy,

which is then converted into AC energy
in a transmitter located in the market.
The AC energy is sent back out to devices
that light and heat the market.
The city's solar Farmers Market
helped earn Ann Arbor the honor of
being named a Solar America City, one of
only twenty-five in the country. The U.S.
Department of Energy awarded this title
to cities that espoused solar technology.
The mayor prides himself on the city's
plethora of "green" buildings.
The police station and courthouse are
as environmentally up to date as possible.
And the new city hall that is being built
is an elite gold LEED certified building,
according to Hieftje. This means the new
building will have the most advanced,
state of the art, green features available
today including geothermal heating on
all floors.
The building was also designed to be
easily updated when new technologies
come out. "An investment in an energy
efficient building costs you upfront but it
comes back to you," Hieftje said.
Hieftje has emphasized
the importance of
investing now to save
later. And his plan was
wisely plotted - beginning far before
the economic recession. In the few years
since Hieftje made his challenge, the city
has made back alarge chunk of the money
it invested. The LED lights, which last
five times as long as normal bulbs, will
save taxpayers money. And the mayor
believes that being environmentally and
fiscally savvy has brought people to Ann
Arbor.
"You'd have to look far and wide to try
to find a city that is doing more than we
do," Hieftje said.
Ann Arbor is a serious frontrunner
in the alternative energy race. On the
technologicalside, the city's webpagehas
won numerous awards for its attention
to the cause. And the mayor himself has
been recognized for the strides he has
personally made for the city. In 2008,
Hieftje received the Environmental
Leadership Award from the Michigan
