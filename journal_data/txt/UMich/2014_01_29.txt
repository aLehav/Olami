Obama talks
affordability
in address

President focuses
on domestic policy
in sixth State of
the Union speech
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
President Barack Obama
delivered his sixth State of the
Union address Tuesday night,
highlighting mostly domestic
policy items such assjob creation
and student loan debt. He also
announced an executive order
to raise the minimum wage for
federal contractors.
In his speech, one particular
area of importance for students
is the process of informing col-
lege students and their families
about higher education, such as
student loans.
"I want to work with Con-
gress to see how we can help
even more Americans who feel
trapped by student loan debt,"
Obama said.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the
speech, Rep. John Dingell (D-

Mich.) said each topic Obama
mentioned - from the war
in Afghanistan to immigra-
tion reform - was pertinent to
twenty-somethings and college
students.
"It's their country," Dingell
said. "Everything is of impor-
tance to them."
On the topic of student loans,
Dingell agreed with Obama's
statements, adding that it was
necessary to provide financial
assistance to college students.
"That's one of the biggest
problems when I talk to the peo-
ple I see and serve," Dingell said
of paying off student loan debt.
LSA junior Mary Bridget Lee,
communications director of the
University's chapter of the Col-
lege Democrats, echoed the
need to for legislators to consid-
er college students' finances at
the organization's watch party
at the Ford School of Public
Policy.
"A key component for col-
lege students is our purchasing
power and being able to afford
institutions like this one," she
said.

Documents indicate
former kicker violated
Student Sexual
Misconduct Policy
By MATT SLOVIN and
ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Sports Writer and
Daily StaffReporter
Brendan Gibbons, the Michi-
gan football team's starting
kicker for the past three seasons,

was permanently separated from
the University of Michigan last
month for violating the Univer-
sity's Student Sexual Misconduct
Policy, according to documents
reviewed by The Michigan Daily.
"You will be permanently
separated from the University of
Michigan effective December 20,
2013," reads a Dec. 19, 2013 let-
ter addressed to Gibbons at his
Florida residence from the Uni-
versity's Office of Student Con-
flict Resolution, which facilitates
disciplinary proceedings against
students. The Michigan Daily did

not obtain these documents from
the University.
The permanent separation
of Gibbons, who was a graduate
student in the School of Social
Work after graduating with a
general studies degree, stems
from an incident that was report-
ed to have occurred on Nov. 22,
2009, according to documents.
This corresponds with previ-
ous media reports that a sexual
assault involving a Michigan foot-
ball player occurred in the early
morning hours of that day. Gib-
bons was a freshman and a mem-

ber of the football team at the
time that the conduct was alleged
to have occurred.
In the Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities as
well as the Student Sexual Mis-
conduct Policy, the University
uses the phrase "permanent sepa-
ration" to refer to the expulsion of
a student. The letter to Gibbons,
signed by Stacy Vander Velde,
associate director of OSCR, stated
that he would be prohibited from
taking any further courses at the
University and that his student

Four candidates have declared for
the Ann Arbor mayoral race of 2014,
and though they all identify as Demo-
crats, their personalities, the issues
they plan to emphasize and the way
they plan to interact with the Univer-
sity all differ.
Each candidate has a connection
to Ann Arbor, whether it be academic
or personal, and each has varying
degrees of support for current Mayor
John Hieftje (D) and experience as an
elected member of the City Council.
Councilmember Christopher Taylor
(D-Ward 3) attended the University
for 12 years, earning degrees in vocal
performance, English and history and
finally attending the Law School. His
background has led him to explore his
long-term interest in government and
politics through the City Council.

RESEARCH
Study finds fungicide
worsens coffee rust issue

Khaled Mattawa has
authored four books,
translated nine
By BRIE WINNEGA
Daily StaffReporter
Associate English Prof. Khaled
Mattawa has been elected to
the Academy of American Poets
Board of Chancellors, the group
announced Jan 15.
Mattawa is the author of four
books of poetry and has trans-
lated nine books of contemporary
Arabic poetry. He is the recipi-
ent of numerous other awards,
including the prestigious Gug-
genheim Fellowship and the PEN
American Center Award for Poet-
ry Translation.
The Academy was established
80 years ago with a mission to
support poets and to promote
appreciation for poetry across the
United States. One of the organi-
zation's ongoing efforts is Nation-
al Poetry Month, which takes
place every April.
Mattawa said although his elec-
tion was only recently announced
by the AAP, he has known about it
since December.
"All of our chancellors are well-
established in the art of poetry,"
said AAP Executive Director
Jennifer Benka. "They have pub-
lished multiple books and they

have been recognized by other
institutions for the excellence of
their art."
New chancellors are selected
by the current Academy Board
and serve for a term of six years.
Mattawa is now one of 15 Acad-
emy Board members.
Benka said responsibilities
of chancellors include suggest-
ing ideas and giving feedback for
the Academy's programs, getting
involved with projects for Nation-
al Poetry Month and serving as
judges for two of the seven major
prizes awarded to poets through-
out the country.
Mattawa said he was honored
to receive this recognition.
"I feel lucky," he said. "Wheth-
er people think that I deserve this
recognition or not, I certainly feel
lucky. There's a lot to feel lucky
about in my own life as an indi-
vidual and as awriter."
Mattawa, who was born in
Libya, said his membership in the
AAP, an American institution, is a
testament to his ability to remain
whole as an individual rather than
culturally divided.
"Some of my friends from Libya
have been telling me this is some
of the best news they've heard in a
while," Mattawa said. "So, if only
for that, to bring my other country
some good news with this honor is
agreat thing in my life."

Penn State shoots for the moon

A team of faculty and students
at Pennsylvania State University
are crowdfunding their way to
the moon in what organizers say
is the first space mission open to
public participation, the Daily
Collegian reported Tuesday.
The mission is being pursued
as partof Google's Lunar XPrize
competition, which offers $40
million to the first private
group to successfully land on
the moon's surface, travel 500
meters above, below, or around,
- and collect two "mooncasts."
The Penn State team, self-
named the Lunar Lions, hopes
to raise $406,536 through the
crowdfunding campaign, which
opened Jan. 20 and will run
through Feb. 25.

"The goal is to have one
ordinary person help another
ordinary person accomplish
extraordinary things," Ajeeth
Ibrahim, Lunar Lions student
president, told the Daily Colle-
gian.

Documents show NSA is
tracking smartphone apps

Downloaded
materials can give
personal data to
NSA and GCHQ
LONDON (AP) - Documents
leaked by former NSA contactor
Edward Snowden suggest that
spy agencies have a powerful
ally in Angry Birds and a host of
other apps installed on smart-

phones across the globe.
The documents, published
Monday by The New York
Times, the Guardian, and
ProPublica, suggest that the
mapping, gaming, and social
networking apps which are a
common feature of the world's
estimated 1 billion smartphones
can feed America's National
Security Agency and Britain's
GCHQ with huge amounts of
personal data, including loca-
tion information and details

such as political affiliation or
sexual orientation.
The size and scope of the pro-
gram aren't publicly known, but
the reports suggest that U.S. and
British intelligence easily get
routine access to data generated
by apps such as the Angry Birds
game franchise or the Google
Maps navigation service.
The joint spying program
"effectively means that anyone
using Google Maps on a smart-
phone is working in support of a
GCHQ system," one 2008 docu-
ment from the British eaves-
dropping agency is quoted as
saying. Another document - a
hand-drawn picture of a smirk-
ing fairy conjuring up a totter-
ing pile of papers over a table
marked "LEAVE TRAFFIC
HERE" - suggests that gather-
lng the data doesn't take much
effort.
The NSA did not directly
comment on the reports but said
in a statement Monday that the
communications of those who
were not "valid foreign intelli-
gence targets" were not of inter-
est to the spy agency.
"Any implication that NSA's
foreign intelligence collection
is focused on the smartphone
or social media communications
of everyday Americans is not
true," the statement said. "We
collect only those communica-
tions that we are authorized by
law to collect for valid foreign
intelligence and counterintelli-
gence purposes - regardless of
the technical means used by the
targets."
GCHQ said it did not com-
ment on intelligence matters,
but insisted that all of its activ-
ity was "authorized, necessary
and proportionate."
Intelligence agencies' inter-
est in mobile phones and the
networks they run on has
been documented in several of
Snowden's previous disclosures,
but the focus on apps shows how
everyday, innocuous-looking
pieces of software can be turned
into instruments of espionage.

Policemen stand guard outside a courthouse during the trial of Egypt's toppled President Mohammed Morsi in Cairo,
Egypt on Tuesday.
Egyptian Criminal Court
tries Morsi for second time

Former president
will appear before
the court in February
CAIRO (AP) - The second
court appearance for ousted
President Mohammed Morsi
was very different from his first:
He wore a white prison uniform
Tuesday instead of a trim dark
suit. And when the Islamist
leader wanted to speak, a judge
controlled his microphone in
the soundproof glass cell.
The session was carefully
managed by authorities, with
state TV showing only edited
excerpts, not a planned live
feed, as the military-backed
interim government and allied
media sought to control the
narrative of Egypt's political
turmoil following the Arab
Spring.
An agitated Morsi paced in
the courtroom cage, separated
from other defendants, and
raised his hands as he angrily
questioned whyhe was in court.
"Who are you? Tell me!" he
shouted at the presiding judge.
Judge Shabaan el-Shami
responded: "I am the head of
Egypt's criminal court!"

After five hours, the court
session was adjourned until
Feb. 22.
The 62-year-old former pres-
ident is on trial with leaders of
the Muslim Brotherhood, and
militants from the Palestinian
Hamas group and Lebanon's
Hezbollah. They are charged in
connection with prison breaks
that freed 20,000 inmates dur-
ing the 18-day uprising against
Morsi's predecessor, Hosni
Mubarak.
Three years ago, on Jan. 28,
2011, protesters battled police
in Cairo with stones and fire-
bombs, and burned down the
ruling party headquarters.
Crowds chased away the much-
reviled police forces, torched
their vehicles and burned some
of their stations - forcing some
police to withdraw or join
the demonstrators, only to be
replaced by the military.
To mark Tuesday's anniver-
sary, Morsi supporters briefly
clashed with police in central
Cairo. Separately, gunmen also
killed an aide to the interior
minister in a drive-by shoot-
ing outside Cairo, as well as a
policeman guarding a church
in a southern section of the
capital. Security forces were

deployed, erecting checkpoints
as they braced for more trou-
ble, but no major violence was
reported.
Morsi's appearance in court
was only the second time he
has been seen in public since
the July 3 military coup that
toppled him following mass
protests of his administration.
Egypt's first freely elected
president was shown in court in
November on separate charges
in a session that was marked by
his repeated outbursts.
This time, however, Morsi
was separated from other
defendants in the glass cage,
with a microphone controlled
by the judge.
A promised live feed from the
courtroom did not occur, some-
thing a senior state TV official
told local media that security
forces demanded.
In reports from the court,
where journalists were allowed
to attend but could not record
or photograph, Morsi asked
the judge to address him as the
"president of the republic so
long as I am alive or have not
stepped down." The comments
were carried by the state flag-
ship newspaper Al-Ahram, in
its online version.

GIBBONS
From Page 1A
privileges would be revoked.
An additional OSCR docu-
ment signed by Vander Velde
and dated Nov. 20, 2013, stated
that it was determined by the
University that a preponderance
of evidence supports "a finding
that the Respondent engaged in
unwanted or unwelcome con-
duct of a sexual nature, commit-
ted without valid consent, and
that conduct was so severe as
to create a hostile, offensive, or
abusive environment." The Daily
has been told that the respondent
referred to in this letter is Gib-
bons. Complainants in this case
are not identified in the docu-
ments reviewed by the Daily.
Dave Ablauf, an associate ath-
letic director and spokesman
for the Athletic Department,
declined to comment, noting that
it was the first time it had been
suggested to him that Gibbons
was permanently separated.
"We can't comment on any-
thing that involves private stu-
dent matters in terms of student
academic standings or University
standing," Ablauf said.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said he could not
comment on Gibbons' academic
record because of the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy
Act.

Gibbons could not be immedi-
ately reached for comment.
Permanent separation is a very
rare sanction in OSCR proceed-
ings. In the latest OSCR data from
the 2011-2012 academic year,
there were zero permanent sepa-
rations. The Statement of Stu-
dents Rights and Responsibilities
states that "some behavior is so
harmful to the University com-
munity or so deleterious to the
educational process" that it may
result in expulsion, among other
possible sanctions.
The Daily is not aware of any
criminal charges pending against
Gibbons. OSCR operates inde-
pendently of the criminal justice
system.
Investigators in the Univer-
sity's Office of Institutional
Equity, which reviews internal
complaintsofsexualassault,work
with alower standard of evidence
than that of criminal prosecutors,
who must prove that a defendant
is guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt. OIE may presume that a
respondent engaged in alleged
conduct if there is a "preponder-
ance of evidence" against the
individual. This standard states
that a respondent is responsible if
there is enough evidence to sug-
gest a complaint is more likely
true than not.
If OIE investigators find a
respondent to be responsible for
alleged conduct, OSCR officials
determine what sanctions, if

any, will be leveled against the
respondent. According to Vander
Velde's letter to him, Gibbons
met with OSCR officials on Dec.
4, 2013, to discuss OIE's findings.
It's unclear why sanctions
were not decided in this matter
until recently. Revised University
policies regarding sexual miscon-
duct may have forced officials to
internally review or re-review the
allegations. The updated policies,
which have been in effect since
2011, state that any allegation of
sexual misconduct received by
the University must be investi-
gated.
Reports made to officials other
than those at the Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter, Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services and the Office of
Ombuds are not considered con-
fidential and are expected to be
investigated by OIE. The partici-
pation of survivors in sexual mis-
conduct cases is not required for
the disciplinary process to take
place. Other individuals or Uni-
versity officials may report alle-
gations.
A permanent separation would
render an athlete ineligible to
participate in any NCAA event.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke said
at a Dec. 23 press conference that
Gibbons didn't travel to Tempe,
Ariz., for the Dec. 28 Buffalo Wild
Wings Bowlbecause he was deal-
ing with a family matter at home.
Ablauf, the Athletic Depart-

ment spokesman, said he is
unable to comment as to whether
Hoke was referring to the perma-
nent separation.
Earlier, on Nov. 30, 2013, Gib-
bons sat out the football team's
regular-season finale against
Ohio State after team officials
said he suffered an undisclosed
muscle injury in the week leading
up to the game.
"He's a little iffy," Hoke said
on Dec. 16. "He's kicking a little
bit. But I don't want to over-kick
him. I've never been a kicker,
so I can't imagine that (muscle)
problem. So he's a little iffy."
Hoke assumed the position
of head coach in 2011, after
the incident is alleged to have
occurred.
Though it's not clear what
Gibbons' career plans are,
Vander Velde's letter noted that
he might be obligated to inform
future schools or employers
of the sexual misconduct case
in order to comply with those
organizations' respective poli-
cies. The letter advises Gibbons
to "make this disclosure in the
future as appropriate and in a
manner that authentically rep-
resents the behavior for which
you have been found respon-
sible."
Gibbons is fourth in made
field goals in Michigan history
and owns the program record
for consecutive successful extra
points with 141.

OBAMA
From Page 1A
Magill, president of Young Amer-
icans for Liberty, opposed gov-
ernment interference in higher
education, particularly in provid-
ing student loans. He said loans
push tuition increases.
"If you make their cost afford-
able, if you continually give peo-
ple money so that they can pay a
certain price, colleges can raise
their prices," Magill said.
Obama reiterated many issues
explored in his previous address-
es, representing overarching pol-
icy objectives from his term that
he has not completed yet.
Michael Heaney, assistant pro-
fessor of organizational studies,
said it is common for second-term
presidents to address issues that
may only be favored by one party.
"Especially in the president's
second term, especially in a
country that's highly divided,
especially when the president's
approval rating is below 50 per-
cent, it's very difficult for the
president under those circum-
stances to get cooperation from
Congress," Heaney said. "Under
these types of conditions, presi-
dents usually look more toward
things they can do unilaterally."
Obama called for action on
income in equality, announcing
an executive order that will set
the minimum wage for work-
ers under new federal contracts
at $10.10, a $2.85 increase from
the current rate of $7.25. Accord-
ing to an Obama administration
fact sheet, the executive order
will cover workers who are per-
forming services or constructing
buildings.
Luke Shaefer, assistant profes-
sor of social work, said this mini-
mum wage bump would affect
a small group of new federal
employees. However, it has the
potential to have a far-reaching
effect.
"Even if the president's mini-
mum wage increase for federal
contractors is on the whole more
of a symbolic gesture rather than
one with concrete policy effect,
it is possible that it will cause a
chain reaction to increase activity
across states," Shaefer said.
In Michigan, this change is
already underway - a coalition of
organizations called Raise Michi-
gan announced a push Monday to
create a ballot question in Novem-
ber addressing an increase in the
minimum wage.
Dingell said raising the mini-
mum wage was necessary to fos-
ter economic growth.
At the College Democrats'

watch party, members of the stu-
dent organization said minimum
wage discussion was the most
pertinent element of the speech.
Lee said a rising minimum wage
will benefit college students.
"The majority of college stu-
dents work at least part-time jobs
to support themselves," she said.
"With current costs of attend-
ing an institute of higher learn-
ing, raising the minimum wage is
going to really make college more
accessible."
LSA freshman Benjamin
Meisel, freshman chair of the
University's chapter of the Col-
lege Republicans, said Obama's
support of a higher minimum
wage would inhibit growth in
small business.
"We should be encouraging
growth, not stifling it," Meisel
wrote in an e-mail.
Obama also announced the
creation of six more private-pub-
lic research partnerships in 2014.
He added that connecting busi-
nesses and research universities
and creating research hubs are
key to securing high-tech manu-
facturing jobs in the U.S.
The aspiration aligns with
that of the University's Michigan
Mobility Transformation Center,
a $100 million government-indus-
try partnership. Similar to tech
hubs that Obama pointed out, the
Center aims to mark Ann Arbor
as "the first American city with
a fleet of networked, driverless
vehicles."
Another facetofthe president's
approach to Congress came in
his stance on climate change.
Andrew Hoffman, professor of
natural resources and environ-
ment, said there has been a shift
in the president's rhetoric when
discussing environmental issues.
"He's going to get things done
through legislative action or
through other means, but he's
going to follow his agenda with
or without Congress," Hoffman
said.
The president touched on for-
eign policy at the conclusion of
his address, emphasizing that
the United States will remain
invested in Iraq and Afghanistan,
despite all American troops being
withdrawn from the region.
"The fact is, that danger
remains," Obama said. "While we
have put al-Qaida's core leader-
ship onsa path to defeat, the threat
has evolved, as al-Qaida affiliates
and other extremists take root in
different parts of the world."

COFFEE

trix, a fungus that mainly attacks
coffee leaves. Pale yellow rust-
like spots will appear on the
leaves of infected coffee plants,
which will then lose their leaves
entirely and die from defoliation.
A disease that ravaged South
Asia during in the 19th century,
coffee rust had not been a sig-
nificant threat to Latin Ameri-
can plantations until late 2012.
Due to reasons not yet under-
stood by scientists, it killed
thousands of coffee trees in the
region, resulting in immense
economic losses.
Vandermeer said spraying
fungicide and removing the
plants' sources of shade are

the two most common ways
to fight the disease in Latin
America. However, both solu-
tions create serious problems
that may result in harming the
complicated ecological sys-
tem.
"Fungicide functions by kill-
ing any kind of fungus directly,
and here's the problem: The dis-
ease is caused by a fungus, but
there are also several other kinds
of fungi that would kill this fun-
gus," Vandermeer said. "So you
kill the bad fungus and the good
fungus at the same time when
using the fungicide."
He added that White Halo
fungus is one of these "good"
fungi that can help control the
disease but is being killed inad-
vertently due to human behav-
ior.

Additionally, abandoning tra-
ditional shade-growing tech-
niques will not stop coffee rust
dispersion. Accordingto Vander-
meer, it actually does the oppo-
site.
He explained that the tra-
ditional plantation in Central
America creates a canopy of
shade for coffee, which resem-
bles a forest system in its com-
plexity.
"But people are removing the
shades, thinking that if they get
the coffee outto the full sun, then
the fungus will stop growing,"
Vandermeer said. "But we know
as a fact that it does not work. In
fact, you get more fungus when
you have them in the sun instead
of the shade."
Exposure to sunlight does
not kill the fungus, but the

shade will lead to less wind,
which is how the fungus
spreads, according to Vander-
meer.
The ecologist provided his
recommendations for fight-
ing the disease: to continue
research on the fungus, return
to shade-growing techniques
and "definitely stop using fun-
gicide."
However, Vandermeer added
that out that these solutions
could face difficulties because
they run counter to the inter-
ests of fungicide sellers.
"They run around telling
people, 'What you need is fun-
gicide.' It was the same thing
with pesticide and our food
system. And most farmers get
their information from sales-
people."


MAYOR
From Page 1A
Working as a transactional
lawyer, Taylor believes he has an
ability to work well with people in
opposition to one another. Since
his election to the City Council
in 2008 - when he defeated Ste-
phen Kunselman (D-Ward 3),
another current councilmember
now running for mayor - Taylor
has focused on a few key issues
in preserving Ann Arbor's char-
acter while still being open to
innovation.
"Ann Arbor is a place where
there is tremendous opportuni-
ty but there is also a value in its
character," Taylor said. "It will
be important that the next mayor
focuses on transportation, stabil-
ity and trying to ensure that we
have the kind of modest growth
that will enable us to attract and
keep young people in the city."
While Hieftje has yet to
endorse any candidate, Taylor's
voting history is very similar to
the mayor's.
Councilmember Sally Peters-
en (D-Ward 2) categorized the
candidates as being in support or
opposed to the mayor's policies.
Petersen, in contrast to Taylor,
is an infrequent supporter of the
mayor. She attended Williams
College and Harvard Business
School and has been on the City
Council for more than a year.
Although she and Kunselman
have been in agreement on many
of the issues that have appeared
in the City Council over the past
year, Petersen said their person-
alities differ greatly.
"He seems to be at odds with

the mayor quite a bit," Petersen
said. "Steve and I actually tend
to vote very similarly, but it's
not because I'm voting against
the mayor, it's because I really
believe in the issue. His tempera-
ment is very different from mine
- I like to consider myself very
diplomatic and collaborative. He
likes the argument."
While Petersen is currently
a stay-at-home mom, her back-
ground includes a focus on busi-
ness and customer concerns,
traits she said are highly trans-
ferable to the position of mayor.
Although Petersen and Taylor do
not seem to be in agreement on
all past City Council issues, she
identifies herself as beingsimilar
in personality to Taylor, citing
the recent decisions in the pedes-
trian crossing ordinance.
"With Chris Taylor, I think
our temperaments are very simi-
lar. He tends to vote more like the
mayor and he tends to have avery
idealistic approach, which I will
say is not always the most prag-
matic approach," she said.
Petersen addressed concerns
relatingnto her lack of City Coun-
cii experience relative to other
candidates.
"There may be a concern that
I've only been on Council for over
ayear nowbut I love Ann Arbor,"
Petersen said. "If I am elected
mayor, I will have had twice the
experience as the current mayor
when he was elected."
The fourth candidate, Coun-
cilmemberSabraBriere (D-Ward
1), said her years of experience on
the City Council and her years
spent focusing on the concerns
and opinions of citizens makes
her the best mayoral candidate.
"I am open to working with

people with whom I disagree,"
Briere said. "That means that I
have learned from people from
all over this community who
start the conversation telling me
what I'm doing wrong, and leave
the conversation knowing they
have been listened to. And I have
been told that is unique from all
of the other people running."
When it comes to the Univer-
sity, each councilmember hopes
to establish strong relation-
ships with the school in spite of
some competing interests. As for
expandingcampus outward, Ann
Arbor residents often voice con-
cerns that their traditional, fami-
ly-based neighborhoods could be
in danger of a student takeover.
"It is not, however, because of
the people in the building," Bri-
ere said. "But for many people,
their shorthand is we don't want
students because what they are
really saying is we don't want
beer pong, and I can understand
that."
The expanding University has
increased tensions with the city,
reducing opportunities for tax
revenue in Ann Arbor amidst
downsizing within the citygiven
the recent economic environ-
ment.
"The University is not con-
cerned about students; they are
concerned about the University,
and the University includes their
physical plant, what they build,
where they build it," Briere said.
"It includes their athletic activi-
ties, it includes maintenance of
the existing physical plant and
it includes their various revenue
sources, but it's not about the city
and the students."
Kunselman echoed similar
views, addingthat the University

tends to operate like a business
enterprise.
Kunselman, an Ann Arbor
native and University alum,
said he's disappointed with the
political insincerity and dishon-
esty he said he has witnessed in
Ann Arbor. He said he hopes to
restore a sense of trust in local
government, which will, in his
opinion, translate to a more posi-
tive relationshipbetween the city
and the University.
"You're not goingto get a dime
from the 'U.' There's already a lot
of existing collaboration between
the University and the city so
there's not much more that you
can do there. But what has been
missing is trust," Kunselman
said. "The University has a very
high standard for reputation, so
if the government is not trusted,
why would they want to be in the
same room with it?"
In regards to his only loss in
his six runs for City Council,
Kunselman said his and Taylor's
politics and personality still dif-
fer for this election.
"Thatgrudge is still outthere,"
Kunselman said. "There is a con-
tingent of people that feel they
are better than the rest of us."
As a University employ-
ee, Kunselman has a unique
approach to University and city
relations. He has also empha-
sized his intentions to make Ann
Arbora more fiscally responsible
and practical city.
"Local government has con-
tracted in the past few years,"
Kunselman said. "It's going be
a slow road to get back some of
that because obviously govern-
ment finance is much more con-
strained than it has been in years
past."

A suspect separation
In order to clear itself of suspicion, the 'U' must be transparent
he University's Student Sexual Misconduct Policy defines an expulsion
as a "permanent separation from the University." On Dec. 20, 2013,
former Michigan football kicker Brendan Gibbons was "permanently
separated" from the University. The expulsion was handed down following the
University's investigation into a case of sexual assault dating to Nov. 22, 2009.
At the moment, there is little information surrounding the story due to the
nature of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which guarantees
the nondisclosure of student records. Also, University officials have declined to
comment on the story. While it is commendable that the University succeeded
in punishing Gibbons for violating the Student Sexual Misconduct Policy, there
are serious questions that the school needs to answer.

Dude, you're a feminist

In November of 2009, Gibbons was allegedly
involved in a sexual assault incident. On Nov.
20, 2013, a letter from the University's Office
of Student conflict Resolution - the body that
carries out disciplinary proceedings against
students - stated that a preponderance of evi-
dence was present to find Gibbons responsible
for the alleged sexual assault. Gibbons met with
investigators from the Office of Institutional
Equity on Dec. 4, 2013 to review the findings.
On Dec. 19, 2013, OSCR contacted Gibbons via
a letter to his residence, informing him that he
was permanently separated from the Universi-
ty as of Dec. 20,2013. More than four years after
the incident, action was finally taken against
Gibbons, which leads to many questions for the
University administration and Athletic Depart-
ment that as of yet remain unanswered. Due to
legal restraints of FERPA, there is a significant
lack of available information from which to
draw concrete conclusions.
The University's delay in reaching a deci-
sion regarding the Gibbons case until now is
suspect. The initial reports of an incident of
sexual assault surfaced in November of 2009,
more than four years ago. At the moment,
no information has been released regard-
ing the investigation carried out by the OIE,
making it impossible to know the timeline
of the inquiry - when crucial evidence was
obtained or even when the investigation was
launched. It is possible that the implementa-
tion of new University policies regarding sex-

ual misconduct in 2011 led to the case being
reviewed. Still, that was more than two years
ago. It is difficult - maybe even unfair - to
speculate on the delicate process of inves-
tigating an allegation of sexual assault, but
the overwhelming student response has been
one of suspicion. If the University knowingly
postponed the expulsion of Gibbons in any
way over the last four years, it would be an
atrocity of the highest degree.
The timing of the expulsion is question-
able - and the University has not provided an
explanation for why the separation process
concluded in late December. The disciplin-
ary action of the University comes right at
the end of Gibbon's football career and at the
end of the football team's season. Four days
after Gibbons received the letter of expul-
sion from OSCR, Michigan coach Brady Hoke
announced that Gibbons would not play in
the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl due to a "fam-
ily matter." At this point, Gibbons was already
expelled from the University - therefore no
longer on the team - indicating a bizarre lack
of communication between the University and
the Athletic Department.
Although the University claims tobe bound
by FERPA in terms of what kind of information.
it can release regarding Gibbons' proceedings,
it needs to clarify the details of the case to the
best of its ability under the law to save the Uni-
versity's reputation and reinforce that this is
truly a community that expects respect.

On Friday, the University announced the
selection of Mark Schlissel as its 14th president.
While some may rejoice at this choice, I received
the news lukewarmly. This is not because I doubt
President-elect Schlissel's qualifications, but
'rather because I am disappointed at how the
selection committee simply played it safe.
By "safe," I mean that they chose someone
who will understand how to operate the giant
that is the University of Michigan Health Sys-
tem, someone who understands how to continue
bringing in research grants and someone who
will uphold the University's commitment to aca-
demic excellence.
On the other hand, I share some students' dis-
satisfaction that the selection committee did not
make a bold choice that signifies a readiness to
challenge the status quo and recommit our Uni-
versity to the public mission. Students dreamed
of a president who would be ready to embrace
what #BBUM is trying to achieve, tackle the
complexity ofhealth and wellness issues on cam-
pus and display the moral obligation to commit
the University to social justice and sustainability
beyond the low-hanging fruits.
Even though students were excluded from
the selection committee this time, we were still
holding out hope that our voices would be heard
at the student forum organized by the presiden-
tial search committee back in September 2013.
However, after being told by the search firm
that at the time of the student forum, candidate

interviews were already being held, I was skepti-
cal thatthe regents really cared about our voices.
The fact that the issue of sustainability was not
even mentioned once in Friday's announcement
despite beingfeatured prominently atthe student
forum increased my exasperation. Perhaps this
is just a matter of miscommunication. If so, the
selection committee needs to communicate to us
whether they cared. However, if the lack of stu-
dent input in this entire process is any indication,
the Regents don't seem to care and students have
every right tobe angry.
We keep saying that higher education will
change dramatically over the next few decades.
Friday, the regents spoke loud and clear that
they are content maintaining the status quo
rather than being bold and responding to student
demands. As my friend remarked, the University
could have done amazing things with this oppor-
tunity. It didn't.
While my immense disappointment is direct-
ed at the regents and the selection committee, I
withhold my judgment of President-elect Schlis-
sel until he articulates his vision. In fact, his
record at Brown shows a willingness to work
with students, and his remarks on affordability
and access are commendable. I hope he proves all
my doubts and concerns unfounded and that in a
year's time, Iwill be able to look back and claim
that this viewpoint is no longer relevant.

r )f ISEND L
Winter wimp-out
TO THE DAILY:
Is anybody reading today's print edition?
Probably not, because the University of Michigan
cravenly chose to cancel classes today, ending a
proud 36-year tradition of keeping school open,
no matter the weather. The last time Michigan
canceled classes, it snowed 19 inches. Today? It's
a bit cold. And windy! But apparently that's rea-
son enough for the powers that be in the Flem-
ing Building and student government to wave the
white flag. Doesn't the Wolverine's natural habi-
tat extend north of the Arctic Circle?
Students and staff at Minnesota, Wisconsin
and even Michigan State, the three northernmost
Big Ten institutions, will all go to school today,
despite temperatures well below the super-zero
forecast in Ann Arbor. The Michigan Difference:
Wimping out when the wind picks up. Champi-
.ons of the West, or Cowards of the North?

ETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM
Consider the world's largest alumni base dis-
gusted and embarrassed; the decision to can-
cel classes is a betrayal to recent graduates who
proudly recallbraving temperatures significantly
below zero on their way to classes in February
2007 and February 2009. All those who came
before certainly remember their own solemn,
snowy treks to Angell Hall, the Modern Lan-
guages Building and West Hall with negative
temperatures biting at their flesh, but not their
resolve. We are all mortified by this capitulation.
While the University is closed today, the bars
surrounding campus will surely be open for busi-
ness. We bet more than a few Wolverines brave
the blustery weather to enjoy their day off.
This is a yellow decision by the Maize
and Blue.

Obama expected

his second term
Frustrated by years of parti-

State of the Union address to
announce executive actions to
raise the minimum wage for new
federal contracts, help the long-
term unemployed find work and
expand job-training programs.
Obama's go-it-alone strategy,

Palestinian leader
reveals conditions
for withdrawal
Palestinians can accept a lim-
ited Israeli presence in the West
Bank for up to three years after
a peace deal, but reject demands
for a transition period of more
than 10 years, their leader said
in comments broadcast Tuesday.
PalestinianPresident Mahmoud
Abbas reiterated a long-standing
position, suggesting that there's
been little movement in U.S.-medi-
ated talks toward narrowing the
gaps between the two sides.
In an interview broadcast at
an Israeli security conference,
Abbas appeared to be speaking
about the Jordan Valley, an area
in the West Bank that borders
Jordan and has become a cen-
tral issue in Israeli-Palestinian
peace negotiations. Israel wants
a continued presence along the
strategic border and Palestinians
demand they withdraw once a
Palestinian state is formed.

Hawaii student shot
by police in standoff

High school boy
stabbed officer and
attempted escape
HONOLULU (AP) - A
police officer shot a 17-year-
old runaway in the wrist
Tuesday morning at a Hawaii
high school after the teen cut
one officer with a knife and
punched two others, authori-
ties said.
State Department of Edu-
cation spokeswoman Donalyn
Dela Cruz said the boy showed
up at Roosevelt High School
near downtown Honolulu, and
officials there recognized him
as a runaway and called police.
The boy had been a student at
the public school before, but
wasn't registered for classes
there this semester, she said.
Honolulu police Maj. Rich-
ard Robinson said officers
arrived at the school and tried
to take the boy into custody,
but he lunged at them.
The teen attacked one of the
officers with a kitchen knife,
leaving him with a minor cut
on his torso, Robinson said. He
also hit two other officers, but
neither suffered serious inju-
ries.
One of the officers then
fired two shots, hitting the boy
once in the wrist. The teen was
taken to a hospital in serious
condition, EMS spokeswoman
Shayne Enright said. His inju-
ries were not life-threatening.
"The suspect was taken into
custody and walked out of the
school," Robinson said. He
added the boy was arrested
on suspicion of three counts of
attempted murder.
The incident prompted a
lockdown at Roosevelt, which
has an enrollment of nearly
1,400.
The officer who fired is on
administrative leave during an
investigation, Robinson said.

It wasn't immediately clear
whether the officer who fired
aimed for the boy's arm or
another part of his body. Rob-
inson said the details were
part of the ongoing investiga-
tion.
Tenari Maafala, president
of the statewide police officers
union, said the knife posed
a clear threat and officers
are trained to stop a threat,
regardless of the suspect's age.
"They didn't come here
looking to shoot somebody,"
said Maafala, who went to the
school as part of the Honolulu
police peer support unit.
Noah Powell, a 16-year-old
junior, said the shooting hap-
pened in a school counselor's
office. Powell said he was in
a nearby office and heard the
struggle and shots but didn't
see the 17-year-old or know
who he was.
Powell texted his parents
afterward to let them know he
was OK. He said he also posted
on Facebook that he was fine
and got quick responses from
people saying they were pray-
ing for the school.
Kealii Akiona-Soares, a
junior, was in a social studies
class when he heard a faint
shot at about 8:20 a.m.
Then a school bell sounded
and students were kept in their
classrooms, the 17-year-old
said. He said his class contin-
ued with a politics lesson, and
everyone kept mostly calm.
"I guess it happens a lot in
mainland schools, so it's not
surprising," Akiona-Soares
said.
Several parents, including
Carolyn Richardson, gathered
outside Roosevelt after word
of the shooting spread. Some
were visibly upset, and many
texted or called their children,
who were still on lockdown
inside.
"This is really freaking me
out," Richardson said.

Under her watch, Adato

monitored and prisoners pro-
hibited from studying subjects
deemed dangerous, such as
physics, chemistry and political
nationalism.
She said an upside of the pro-
gram was that prisoners, who
later went on to assume power-
ful positions in Palestinian poli-
tics, became fluent in Hebrew
and familiar with Israeli soci-
ety, which helped facilitate
peace negotiations.
Almagor, an Israeli asso-
ciation of families who have

li deterrence.
"It's a basic principle: Just as
those who were killed cannot

Sochi drug tests to
be more thorough

Winter 2014
Olympics will
check athletes
repeatedly
LONDON (AP) - Go ahead
- just try to get away with it.
If you're willing to take the
risk, you'll pay the price.
That's the challenge laid
down to drug cheats think-
ing they can dope their way to
success at the Winter Olym-
pics in Sochi.
International Olympic
and anti-doping officials are
implementing the toughest
drug-testing program in Win-
ter Games history, using intel-
ligence to target athletes and
events considered most at risk.
Authorities are focusing
their efforts on weeding out
dopers through rigorous pre-
games and pre-competition
tests. Armed with an improved
scientific method that can
detect drug use going back
months rather than days, the
International Olympic Com-
mittee will conduct a record
number of tests.
Urine and blood samples
will be stored for eight years
for retroactive testing, provid-
ing further deterrence to any-
one thinking they can avoid
being caught.
"I think it would be stupid
to try to cheat," IOC medical
director Dr. Richard Budgett
told The Associated Press. "If
there are any doping cases in
Sochi, some of them may be
because athletes are being stu-
pid."
The Russian doping lab,
which had faced possible sus-
pension by the World Anti-
Doping Agency for inadequate
procedures, has been fully
accredited for the games and
will be analyzing samples
around the clock.
The Winter Olympics have
produced only a small number

of positive tests over the years
as they involve far fewer ath-
letes than the Summer Games
and fewer sports with a record
of doping.
Olympic officials hope any
cheats will have been screened
out already through extensive
out-of-competition testing
carried out around the globe
in the months, weeks and days
leading up to the games.
Don't think, though, that
nobody's cheating or that
Sochi will be doping-free.
"You'd be foolish to write
off the Winter Games as hav-
ing any lesser risk," said Andy
Parkinson, chief executive of
Britain's national anti-doping
agency.
The IOC plans to carry out
2,453 tests in Sochi, includ-
ing 1,269 pre-competition
controls. That's a 57 percent
increase in pre-games tests
from the 2010 Winter Games
in Vancouver.
The majority of the 1,184 in-
competition tests will be done
in sports like cross-country
skiing and biathlon, endur-
ance events with a history of
blood doping and EPO use.
About 20 percent of the doping
controls will be blood tests.
Much of the testing will be
based on intelligence gathered
from law-enforcement agen-
cies, whistle-blowers and pre-
vious suspicious blood level
results.
The testing program begins
on Jan. 30, the day the athletes
village opens. From then until
the close of the games on Feb.
23, Olympic athletes can be
tested at any time and at any
place, including training sites
anywhere in the world. The
games open on Feb. 7.
About 2,000 of the 3,000
athletes competing in Sochi
are expected to be tested -
some of them two, three or
even four times. The top five
in all medal events are tested,
as well as others chosen at
random.

on Monday. "It's been frustrating
not being able to compete, I
just tried to lead by going out
in the room and working hard,

basically all I can do."
After a year away from
competing, Dutton was more
than eager to return to the lineup.
But, yet again, that anticipation
was put on hold, as a summer
shoulder surgery from another
injury took longer to heal than
anticipated.
"It's been emotionally up and
down for him," Pritzlaff said. "He
was doing really well in rehab
and was as close as he could get to

and thought it was re-torn. He
thought it might be the end for

But as the weeks wore on,
Dutton kept pushing. After

"After a while, he realized
the pain will always be there,"
Pritzlaff said. "Now he's fighting
through it the best he can. He's in
a good spot, he's not 100 percent,
but he knows that no one's 100
percent at this level, so he's just
got to go."
Making his Michigan debut

against Illinois, Dutton looked
as healthy as ever, cruising to a
14-0 victory. The momentum has
only increased as he's taken down
opponents from Minnesota and
Michigan State by scores of 14-2
and 16-3, respectively.
"It's felt good," Dutton said.
"It's nice to go out there after a
while off and get some points
and win some matches. But for
the rest of the season, I'm going
to have some good competitors,
some top-ranked guys, so that
should be a good test."
The hot start has allowed
Dutton to become the No. 9 141-
pound wrestler in the country.
But the biggest tests will come
this weekend, as he takes on Penn
State's Zain Retherford and Ohio
State's Logan Steiber, ranked No.
2 and 3, respectively.
"It just makes me work that
much harder," Dutton said. "I
have to try and get in better and
better shape every day. I was off
the mat for so long, and Iknow the
guys I'm wrestling have had a lot

In Big Ten wrestling, Dutton's
long-awaited - yet so far
successful - return will be put to
the test early and often. But in a
career full of pain, patience and
waiting, few can handle adversity
quite like Dutton.

Joanna Sampson's journey
to becoming an NCAA national
champion in the floor exercise
wasn't always pretty.
If you look at her now, you
wouldn't expect that the senior
co-captain of the Michigan
gymnastics team was once a
stubborn freshman who wanted
everything done her own way.
With that adamancy, though,
came an unshakeable desire to
succeed.
"The thing that I've always
told Joanna is that, because of
her strong personality, she's a
natural leader," said Michigan
women's gymnastics coach Bev
Plocki. "But which direction are
you going to lead?"
Early in Sampson's career,
Plocki knew that Sampson had
the potential for greatness. She
just needed to find her place.
Sampson wasn't enjoying
gymnastics
much at all
right before ,«
she came to But
Michigan. She directic
put too much
pressure on going t
herself, and
her love for the
sport lessened.
Though her
competitive edge has led to
many of her successes, learning
to love gymnastics again
played a significant role in her
achievements.
"I give her all the credit in
the world because she found
out what she wanted to be and
how she wanted to lead, and
she developed herself into that
person," Plocki said.
And she has. On top of being
a captain who her teammates
can look up to, Sampson is a
2013 NCAA champion, a three-
time NCAA All-American, a
Big Ten Women's Gymnast of
the Year, and the 2012-2013
University of Michigan Female
Athlete of the Year.
"One of my biggest
personality changes I've had
since I've been here is really just
being more open to everything
and just kind of trying to relax
a little bit more," Sampson said.
"I try not to take everything so
seriously."
According to Plocki, even
Sampson's parents were
shocked by her attitude change

since she's been with the
Michigan gymnastics team.
"Joanna has matured and
grown up big time in the
years that she's been here at
Michigan," Plocki said.
Fellow co-captain and
housemate Shelby Gies has
experienced Sampson's change
firsthand.
"Sometimes, she thinks that
everything has to be perfect,"
Gies said. "But everything she
does is perfect; she just thinks
that it has to be even more
perfect. She's very hard on
herself a lot of the time, but she's
learning to not be as much."
Sampson treats every
practice as if it were an actual
competition, something her
teammates notice every day.
But though Sampson holds
herself to a very high standard
in and out of practice, her
ability to accept her occasional
mistakes has helped her become
the captain that she is today.
"As a freshman,because ofthe
way I was, I didn't necessarily
expect (to be a captain), but it
was always something I had
a desire to be," Sampson said.
"I just always wanted to be
that person
that my
which teammates
could look up
) you to and come
n are y to, regardless
to lead?" of being a
captain or
not. As long
as I was able
to do that for
my team, then I would've been
happy."
And she's happy now.
"I don't really have a specific
goal for myself other than to
just embrace everything while
having fun my senior year,"
Sampson said. "The season's
going great. I don't think I
could really ask for anything
more so far."
Sampson's hope is that she
can help create the best season
possible for her teammates
while simply enjoying her
final year at Michigan. She
feels pressure, but now she's
approaching the season with a
different mindset.
"I think the sky's the limit
for her in terms of what her
capabilities are," Plocki said. "I
just want her to relax and have
fun and enjoy her senior year
and get the most out of it that
she can."
Sure, it's not the only
balancing act she practices, but
Sampson has found the perfect
harmony between enjoyment
and her will to succeed.

Wolverines embrace 9-year-old teammate

Partnership with
Friends of Jaclyn
helps form bond
By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Most people have played
a sport at one point in their
lives. Whether it's T-ball or
basketball, many children shape
their childhoods around sports
and take away lasting memories.
It could be the game-winning
buzzer beater, a goal, a home
run or just a friendship.
Imagine if that was taken
away.
Enter 9-year-old Miles Root.
Root's life took a drastic turn
when he was just five. His love
of soccer would have to be put
on hold. He was suffering from
a brain tumor and would have
to use his competitive energy
elsewhere.
The brain tumor was fully
removed just a couple of days
later, but Root then suffered
from posterior fossa syndrome
- symptoms that can occur
after surgery - which resulted
in him being unable to speak or
move the right side of his body.
The news was grim for Root,
a Tecumseh, Mich. native. To
cure the syndrome, he had to
endure 30 rounds of radiation,
nine rounds of chemotherapy,
a shunt placement and two
hospitalizations due to
infections.
Root, though, didn't let that
defeat him. Doctors confirmed
he was cancer-free nearly
four months after the initial
diagnosis.
But Root relapsed early last
year and is now in hospice.
Root and his family found
he had a much larger support
system this time, though - the
Michigan men's lacrosse team.
Upon hearinghis story, senior
defensive midfielder Jeff Chu

nice for him. It's awesome to see
others rallying around him."
Though they were already
making an impact in Root's life,
the team wanted to do more.
Again, under Chu's direction,
the Wolverines had no trouble
finding the perfect way.
Chase Jones, founder of the
Vs. Cancer Foundation and a
cancer survivor himself, reached
out to Chu about the possibility
of having the team shave their
heads to raise cancer awareness.
Chu had short hair, making
the decision easy, but others had
a harder time deciding. Lacrosse
"flow," or long hair that hangs
outside of the player's helmet,
is part of the culture. It takes
monthsto growit out, andshaving
it off is a major commitment.
"Hair is a 'lax bro' thing, and
I wasn't sure how the team or
other lacrosse teams would
take to it," Chu said. "But we
recognize it's for a good cause,
so we're willing to give that up."
Saturday,withthehelpofAnn
Arbor's Coach and Four Barber
shop, the players followed
through on their promise.
Brown hadn't had his hair
cut in almost eight months. But
said he would do it again in a
heartbeat.
As one player was getting
shaved, others teased him about
his chances with girls. But
teasing aside, they enjoyed Root
watching as they buzzed off
their hair.
"With Miles here, it not
only helps me, but the team
also," Brown said. "There's
team bonding all over, and
it's unbelievable how this
simple action can get so much
laughing, but also shows a lot of
support for his family, which is
awesome."
Root's presence is recognized
every day by each team member,
and it's allowing him to be part
of something that was taken
from him. For now, sports canbe
a part of Root's life once again.

Senior defensive midfielder Jeff Chu and the Michigan men's lacrosse team shaved their heads in solidarity last Saturday in order to promote cancer awareness.

knew he wanted to get involved.
"I wanted to help and show
support to kids with cancer,"
Chu said. "A lot of athletes get to
go to Mott Children's Hospital
on Thursday nights, and that
was something I always really
enjoyed. So I thought that this
would be something we would
enjoy."
The University's partnership
with the Friends of Jaclyn
program made Chu's aspirations
tangible. The program - with
a mission "to help improve the
quality of life of children and
their families battling pediatric
brain tumors" - accomplishes
its purpose by placing children
on sports teams based on
geographical proximity to the
hospital.
The Friends of Jaclyn

Educating the team about
his illness isn't the only way
Root interacts with the team.
Michigan lets Rootlead the team
in stretches and participate in
practice.
Before the annual Maize vs.
Blue scrimmage, Root was given
the opportunity to put on a maize
jersey to be on the offensive
team, or a blue jersey to be a part
of the defense. He chose blue,
and the unit erupted in cheers.
Brown recalls that moment as
his favorite with Root.
"Being involved in a sport
again is the best part for him,"
said Nicole Root, Miles's mother.
"He can't actively participate

As an elite player,Stauskas
welcomes teams' attention

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
DailySportsEditor
Becoming the 'it' guy for the
Michigan men's basketball team
hasn't been all open 3-pointers
and clear paths to the basket for
Nik Stauskas.
Last year, as the fourth or
fifth option, Stauskas was able
to play as well as his talent
would allow. The deck wasn't
stacked against him.
But as he's emerged this
season as an elite player, the
sophomore guard has had to
deal with the auxiliaryeffects of
a breakout season - becoming
opponents' focal point. Rather
than simply being one of No.
10 Michigan's best players -
someone worth payingattention
to - Stauskas is now the object
of teams'

pretty big learning experience
for me, and I think I've done
a pretty good job after that of
adjusting to how teams play
me," he said.
Initially, opponents played
Stauskas tight, not giving him
space to fire a jump shot and
daring him to beat them off the
dribble. But as Stauskas has
flashed his improved strength,
ball handling and floor vision,
he has punished teams with
high-flying dunks and nifty
passes around the rim.
In Big Ten play, teams have
tried to wear Stauskas out on
the defensive end, trying to
render him less effective on the
other side of the court.

Road test won't faze 'M'

For all its youth and
inexperience, the Michigan
women's basketball team has
figured out what some veteran
squads never do - how to win on
the road.
The

In their six true MGoBlue
road games, the
Wolverines are
beating opponents by an average
of 19.2 points.
Michigan will be on the road
again Wednesday night to face
the USA Today Coaches Poll's
No. 23 team, Nebraska, in its
second-straight away game.
The Cornhuskers (3-3, 13-5)
are the fourth-ranked team
the Wolverines have faced
this season and are a critical
matchup for their NCAA
Tournament aspirations.
Still, Michigan has mixed
results against ranked

opponents, barely losing to
then-No. 15 LSU on Nov. 30 and
then falling more handily to
then-No. 4 Notre Dame on Dec.
14. But the Wolverines nabbed
their first and only win over a
ranked team Jan. 15 when they
beat then-No. 22 Purdue in
West Lafayette.
But Nebraska poses a new
set of challenges for Michigan,
which is just 1-7 against the
Cornhuskers in its last eight
matchups.
"Nebraska is a great program,
a top-25 program that's made a
run in the NCAA Tournament
in the last few years, and they
have a great environment at
home," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "I think
our kids are excited about the
opportunity to play a great
team, a great program on their
home court."
The Cornhuskers' leading
scorer, forward Jordan Hooper,
averages 19.1 points per game
while grabbing 9.9 rebounds.
Hooper is No. 8 among all active
NCAA Division I scorers and
leads Nebraska on both sides of
the floor. And despite Michigan
being the only Big Ten team to
hold opponents under 60 points
in league play, the Cornhuskers'
hot offense could change that.
"(Nebraska) wins all their
games that they score in the
70s, so we're going to try and
focus on stopping that," Barnes
Arico said. "That's been a goal

of our team all year, to really
lock down and play defense
and really limit opponent's best
players."
Another impact player for the
Cornhuskers is forward Emily
Cady, who averages 14.2 points
per game and 9.6 rebounds.
Junior forward Cyesha
Goree will need to continue
her dominance on the boards to
compete with Nebraska. Barnes
Arico will most likely start her
bigger lineup, which puts senior
center Val Driscoll in the middle
with sophomore guard Madison
Ristovski coming off the bench.
Since Ristovski has developed
into a true sixth man, she has
developed chemistry with
the Wolverines' two starting
guards, junior transfer Shannon
Smith and freshman Siera
Thompson.
All three players have the
ability to score from long range
and spread the floor out as well
as penetrate the paint.
Michigan will need its
guards to play all over the
floor to help balance the size
mismatches the Cornhuskers
pose. In addition to Nebraska's
star forwards, the team also
has guard Rachel Theriot, who
averages 13.2 points and 5.9
assists per game.
But at 6-foot-0, Theriot is
taller than the Wolverines'
guards, and she should provide
a challenge for Smith and
Thompson on the defensive end.

The musical and the after-

for Baumanis, that understand-

"First, as an entertainer,"
Baumanis said, "I want the
audience to see a superbly sung
and performed award-winning
musical theater piece. Despite
the seriousness of much of the
show, it has a big heart, it has
plenty of laughs and it's a full-
out Broadway musical."
"Second," he continued, "I
want them to take away their
own notions of what relation-
ships mean, the forms that grief
can take on if left unexamined
and an improved understanding
of bipolar disorder in specific."

and a few-
month-long
bender, we rediscover our hero,
Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon) a year
later in New York, far from the
horrors of last season, where Joe
Carroll (James Purefoy) and his
crew racked up a body count that
most "Call of Duty" players would
be jealous of.
Now five months sober and
teaching up-and-coming crimi-
ologists how to dissect and ana-
lyze crime scenes, Ryan seems to
have gotten it together in light of
she slew of tragic and horrifying
events he witnessed and endured.
Unfortunately, as the anniver-
hary of Carroll's death-by-mas-
sive-explosion approaches, a trio
of ne'er-do-wells boards a subway
train donning masks that are a
facsimile of the cult leader's face,

chanting about resurrection, Joe
being alive and Hardy's inability
to stop them. Images and news
of their killing spree paralyzes
the city, so Ryan and Agent Mike
Weston (Shawn Ashmore) are
dragged back into the world of
murder cults, sociopaths and so
much backstabbing, both literal
and otherwise.
Emma (Valorie Curry), Joe's
protege, meanwhile, finds her-
self left out of this new round of
cult activity, having not heard
from him in nearly a year. With
edgy new lip rings and hair color,
Emma is back tobeing at the right
place at the right time, alerting
other followers she's hiding out
with that Ryan Hardy is back and
on the coattails of the new mur-
ders.
Elsewhere in the city, a blonde
falls prey to ahunky, pale stranger
who casually helps himself to her
refrigerator and iPod while she
lies lifeless on her bed. Dolled-up
and dressed to the nines post-
mortem, she is left in a park,
propped up and reading Joe Car-
roll's novel, destined to be found
by our hero.
The stranger is revealed to be
working with three others - a
former follower, a sadistic French
woman and his twin brother.
Rounding out the new club of
cultists, Mark and Luke (both
played by Sam Underwood) are a

dangerous pair with dichotomous
personalities: the latter explosive
and unpredictable, the former
more reserved and calculated.
Thankfully, even Luke manages
to find solace in hugging it out ...
and collapsing tracheas.

forcing viewers to accept them
as they come, while more subtle
moments surprise you with the
cold-blooded calculations of the

It's fast-paced and shocking,
everything "The Following" has
always delivered, and yet this sea-
son promises the distinct taste of
surprise left over from each epi-
sode - not from the big moments

and strangely terrifying stories
that creep up when you're least

my first time: all ears on Bey by daniel feldman

Personal Statement: Thanks, grandma
by Carolyn Gearig

"Rocking out to Beyoncd's new
album while studying for my finals.
All hail Queen Bey!"
This is essentially all I saw on
social media for two weeks of school
during fall semester.
While I wanted to join in on the
fun, I felt like listening to the Queen
would distract me from studying for
the fast-approaching final exams and
just tempt me into singing the entire-
ty of Destiny's Child songbook.
It wasn't time to cater 2u, Bey. I'm
sorry.
But today, right now, Jan. 13th,
2014, it is time.
I originally wanted to watch all
the music videos that came along
with the self-titled album, BEYON-
CE, butlIrealized I had alreadyspent
a good amount of the day on Beyon-
ce's Instagram. It was time to let my
ears enjoy. My eyes had seen enough
for the day.
Get at me, girl. #NP #Beyonce
Wow. Beyonce is coming out hot
with this first track, "Pretty Hurts."
She's jokingthat pretty hurts though,
right?Beyonce knows she's Beyonc,
right? Did Jay Z say something mean
to you, Bey? I can be back in Brook-
lyn ina snap if you need me.
"Haunted" is spooky. I won't lie.
Is it bad,though, that when Ilisten to
this song all I see is Patrick Swayze's
character from "Ghost" in real life
gliding all over the world watching
people. I'm onto you, Bey. "Road-
house" is one of my favorite movies,
too. Much respect.
Just put "Drunk in Love" on.
Already feel a rich connection to
this song. Guess I just have party-
ing on my mind - or as Bey pointed
out in her track "Party," WE LIKE
TO PARTY. Do you think Beyonce
would be down with being my date
this weekend? I know it's not a night
out on the town with Jay - "Brook-
lyn" - but a random house on Ged-
des with free Backroom Pizza and
unlimited carrots is a tempting

alternative.
Alright, Beyonce just said she
"woke up in a kitchen." Beyonce is
clearly foreshadowing my weekend.
Why did Bey just say surfboard
three times? Please don't blackout.
Please don't blackout. Answer me,
Beyonce.
Jay Z just popped up on the track.
He's on to me. Skipping ahead now.
Wait, did 'Yonce- just say this
album is just for all the "grown
women out there?" Do I have to
call my mom now, or whatever, to
get special permission moving for-
ward?
Moving on, "No Angel." First of
all, I am an angel. Second of all, if
you're saying you aren't one, I can
help fix that. But you need to stop
saying I'm not an angel if you want
my help. Bey. Bey. Bey. Clearly you're
not listening to me. Whatever.
Got to be honest, that track just
made me upset. But I see my favorite
Canadian rapper, Drake, is featured
four tracks from now, so I'll give you
a second chance.
Where is this penthouse? I know
I just ate dinner, but after listening
to "Jealous," I seem to have room for

dessert.
Siri, search for Beyonc's pent-
house, Brooklyn, N.Y. Hello? Siri?
Now finally, "Mine," feat. Drake.
Why did I know Drake would sound
exactly this way when I saw he was
featured in the song? I know he has
intentions of upstaging Beyonce
here, but his voice fading in and out
of the song is just so Drizzy.
OK, all he says is "good girl." I get
it Mr. OVO. Do you have anything
else to say? Glad to see you put a lot
of effort into your lines, sir. This is
not even close to the best you've ever
had. You can do better, Aubrey, and
you know it.
I know the point of "XO" isn't
necessarily about losing electric-
ity, but telling me I can "turn (your)
lights out" is a bit misleading. I think
Beyonce is blackout, guys. I will
NEVER let you lose power, Beyonc.
If such an event were to ever occur
I would find you, light a candle and
make sure you can see forever.
It's been an emotional couple of
hours till this point, but I'm not even
going to question Beyonce on the
notion that she "woke up like this."
Flawless.

I was once an accomplished sell-
er of Girl Scout cookies. In elemen-
tary school, I sold more than any
girl in my troop for five years in a
row. Every Saturday and Sunday
during selling season, my dad and
I would map out a route and walk
around our neighborhood, knock-
ing on doors.
But my all-time record of 478
boxes would not have been pos-
sible without the help of my grand-
mother.
One of my favorite memories
is from the January when I was
in the third grade. My grandma
worked at the University, and she
took me to her office at the Insti-
tute of Social Research on Thomp-
son Street to sell Girl Scout cookies
to her co-workers. We went out for
lunch to her favorite Middle East-
ern restaurant where the servers
knew her name and her favorite
order, and we walked over near
West Quad to spin the cube. I sold
over 100 boxes of cookies that day,
but more importantly, I got to miss
school to hang out with my grand-
ma.
In the four months that fol-
lowed, I came to Ann Arbor more
frequently, but this time it was to
visit the hospital. That April, my
grandma was diagnosed with pan-
creatic cancer. To put it in perspec-
tive, the five-year survival rate is
six percent. Two months later, she
was gone.
My grandma was special. While.
I don't have a very strong'memory

of my elementary-school years, I
remember her vividly. She had a
bubbly, outgoing personality. She
was one of those people who filled
up a room when she walked in
because she was so personable and
friendly. Every day with her was
an adventure - whether we were
taking her RV to the Upper Penin-
sula of Michigan to go camping and
visit her cabin, eating at McDon-
ald's (she would always get Happy
Meals so my brother and I could
have the toys)
or visiting the
American Girl
Place in Chicago.
She's been r
gone for nearly gran
10 years, but my
grandma still that sh
inspires every- .
thing I do. She of girl
had my mother at
19, but managed career
to attend East-
ern Michigan
University while
caring for a child and working as
a clerk at the University Hospital.
While my grandfather pursued a
bachelor's and then a master's and
PhD in Engineering at the Univer-
sity, my grandmother rose through
the ranks of administrative posi-
tions at the University of Michigan
Health System, simultaneously
working toward her undergraduate
and graduate degrees while help-
.isgto raise two sdaghtersShg twas,
eventually hired at the Institute for

Social Research, where she worked
for the last 15 years of her life as an
assistant director.
After her death, a scholarship
fund was established in her name.1
The Laurie Staples Staff Devel-
opment Fund awards scholar-
ships each year to ISR employees
concurrently - pursuing college
bachelor's or graduate degrees.;
This fund is particularly spe-
cial because it is dedicated to my:

and perseverance. She worked for
years just to make ends meet while
never letting go of her academic
pursuits. She was a young mother
who raised children in the 1960s,
'70s and '80s, when opportunities
for women were more limited than
they are today. This didn't deter
her from becoming an administra-
tive leader at the ISR. The hope is
that the Laurie Staples Staff Devel-
opment Fund has and will continue.
to help employees, who, like her,

show potential for great accom-
plishment in the midst of financial
and other difficulties.
On the website for her fund,
there are testimonials from her
colleagues. Some of my favorites
are:
1. "Laurie enjoyed life and liked
to share the delight with others.
She felt strongly about celebrating
accomplishments and encouraging
success."
2. "By contributing to this fund,
one not only

Laurie would be
- quite proud of
and honored to
be associated with."
3. "It is safe to say that you are an
unforgettable, as well as remark-
able and irreplaceable, member of
the Institute."
Meanwhile, I continued to grow
up an hour from Ann Arbor and
occasionally returned with my
family to visit my mother's home-
town. I fell in love with the cam-
pus, and all I worked for in High
,chpol was an acceptance tother
University where my grandmother

worked. Now, I'm a freshman and I
live in a residence hall five minutes
away from her former office, and
I'm reminded of her everyday.
I was covering an Ann Arbor
City Council election watch party
for The Michigan Daily in early
November when I struck up a con-
versation with a University profes-
sor attending the event in support
of a candidate. When he told me
he was a research professor at the
ISR, I asked him if he knew who
Laurie Staples was. His response
was immediate; he had been her
friend back when my grandma was
still working at ISR, and one of his
research assistants was among the
first to receive a scholarship from
the Laurie Staples Staff Develop-
ment Fund. He remembered her as
being a dedicated, funny and hard-
working woman. When I told him
I was her granddaughter, he was
shocked.
It's a testament to my grand-
mother's character and accom-
plishments that her granddaughter
can mention Laurie Staples to a
former colleague after 10 years and
receive an instant outpouring of
positive memories. It is atestament
to my grandmother's loving nature
that she made selling 100 boxes
of girl scout cookies seem like a
career-changing business deal. It
is a testament to her memory that
a fund in her name has been going
strong for nearly a decade.
Thanks, Grandma., Ityse,yop
always.

Rethinking Rackham
by Jeremy Summitt

the thought bubble

It might not be the most aesthetically
pleasing building on campus, at least from
the outside.
There's a pale green roof that rests
above its beige, stone facade. Some peo-
ple, especially undergraduates, walk by it
everyday without knowing its name.
The Rackham Graduate School hard-
ly resembles the likes of the Michigan
League or North Quad. It sticks out, yet
it's still an afterthought.
As you enter Rackham through one
of the three archways atop the stairway,
you're greeted with warm, ambient col-
ors. Sage, burgundy and gold tones dress
the ceiling in elaborate and symmetrical
designs. Dim, cylindrical lights provide a
calming illumination, and encourage you
to keep walking through one of five doors
into a lecture hall.
Rackham can be easy to overlook when
strolling down East Washington Street or
leaving the Modern Languages Building.
Likewise, Michigan's graduate communi-
ty can seem forgotten among the substan-
tial group of undergraduates - except for
the GSIs, of course.
With 15,000 students - less than half of
the undergraduate population - it might
not be the biggest surprise that graduate
students get skimmed over when it comes
to changes in the University curriculum.
Undergraduate voices typically reign
supreme, but as a sizable chunk of the stu-
dent body, the graduate students are still
working to better incorporate their ideas
into the broader University community.
"The fact that we represent 15,000 on
a campus of about 45,000 means there
should be special attention paid to that,"
said Rackham Student Government Presi-
dent Phillip Saccone.
Rackham facilitates 108 Ph.D programs
at the University of Michigan. In addition,
it facilitates 87 master's programs, and 34
certificate programs.
There are some master's programs,
however, that are not so much affiliated
with Rackham, including those in the Col-
lege of Engineering and the Ford School of
Public Policy.
Still, the graduate community has
joined hands in the past few years to make
a larger impact on campus and influence
policy changes in ways that fulfill its
diverse interests.
During Saccone's tenure, pinpointing
the differences between the graduate and
undergraduate population became one
main focus area. Saccone said RSG has
recently developed a good dialogue about
these distinctions with the University's
administration.
VV- "In many ways, the student body on
campus - graduate or otherwise - is sim-
ilar," Saccone said: "And that's great. But

in ways that are very important, they are
different."
Ostensibly, undergraduates are com-
ing from similar high school backgrounds
with a plethora of opportunities in front of
them after graduation - graduate school,
full-time jobs and maybe some traveling.
Graduate students, on the other hand,
are in a program to advance their careers
in that specific area of study. Their goals
and academic preferences are much less
broad than those of undergraduates.
The leap from a student's first four years
of college to a masters or Ph.D program is
grandiose. It calls for a new lifestyle.
"The curriculum is very different. What

scholars of their in graduate programs to do research and
eventually move on to becoming profes-
sors and to further their research. Lab
requirements became cemented into
the curriculum to prepare students for a
career in the classroom. A new genera-
tion of faculty was being bred in the class-
room and the labs, or so most universities
thought.
As Saccone explained about today's
changing job market, not everyone in grad-
uate school aspires to be a professor.
"There are a lot more opportunities for
graduate students with a Ph.D in biomedical
s- sciences to go onto for their future," said Vic-
tor DiRita, associate dean for graduate and
postdoctoral studies in the Medical School.
"There's biotech and pharmaceuticals, and
even public policy jobs and writing."
These diverse fields demand a diversified
curriculum, which Saccone and the rest of
RSG continue working toward.
The skills necessary for a respectable
career in public policy and writing are often
honed outside of a lab. Currently, there are

(and) overall, career goals are different,"
Saccone said.
That's what RSG is trying to relay to the
administration, but sometimes it's more
difficult than one would expect. Policy
changes have sometimes lumped the
graduate students into the undergradu-
ate population as if they have the same
needs. Unfortunately, this constrains the
way specific requests madeby Rackham
students have been addressed.
In hopes of maintaining its image as
the leaders and best, Saccone is aiming to
place the University among the schools
with the most advanced curricula. With
modernized and pertinent course plans,
the graduate student body will eventually
be the universally most well-suited for
coveted opportunities in their respective

Salary S acrificed:
Are unpaid internships worth it?
by Alicia Adamcyzk, Daily Staff Reporter

Christopher Reynolds crossed the
Before Engineering sophomore
Diag on his first day of class last
fall, the Pennsylvania native knew
he would need to save money from
his high school lifeguarding job in order to pay
for his college expenses. Initially, he thought he
could spend his earnings on a new computer.
But as it turned out, he needed the money to
subsidize a different job experience.
Reynolds, a first-generation college student,
pays for his own tuition. So when he looked
for an internship after his freshman year, he
knew he wouldn't be able to take anything that
wasn't paid. While he did manage to secure a
paid internship with General Electric Aviation
in Ohio, Reynolds said had he not successfully
balanced paying his out-of-state tuition while
saving up spare cash throughout the year and
from the previous summer, he wouldn't have
been able to afford to take the job.
Reynolds isn't alone. With the internship
quickly becoming a staple of the collegiate
experience, many students are left pondering
the costs and benefits of committing to a full-
time position without the standard full-time
pay.
"I felt really pressured to do something in the
summer, but worrying about if I could afford
it," Reynolds said. "That pressure really beat me
down the first semester, and I can't tell you how
happy I was that the internship offer was paid:"
Many students, some in as tight of financial
situations as Reynolds, aren't fortunate enough
to receive a paid gig. Instead, they are left to
take an unpaid position to break into a career
field. While many students at the University are
able to afford such experiences with help from
parents or savings from other jobs, others - like
Reynolds - can't rely on outside help.
Without help or savings, the internship expe-
rience can be hard to navigate. But some interns

have fought back against unpaid labor.
In June of last year, two interns working at
Cond6 Nast publications - W Magazine and
The New Yorker - filed suit against the pub-
lishing company, claiming they were paid less
than $1 an hour for their work, which they said
violated federal labor laws. Soon after, Condte
Nast discontinued its internship program.
Since the Conde Nast incident, several other
lawsuits have been filed against companies
alleging that unpaid internships violate federal
law. With the obvious drawback of receiving no
pay for work, the lawsuits further complicate
the validity of unpaid internships for college
students.
Still, while some interns may have a legiti-
mate case, not every unpaid internship is illegal.
The U.S. Labor Department has noted that
work performed by interns in governmental
agencies and nonprofits does not have to be
paid. The Fair Labor Standards Act lays out six
points that must be met to constitute an unpaid
internship, among which include mutual agree-
ment of no payment, and supply of an "educa-
tional environment" for interns.
The language of the law, however, is ambigu-
ous in places, leaving legal interpretation up to
employers and, increasingly, the judiciary.
With some unpaid interns taking the case to
the courts and others, like Reynolds, not able to
afford to work for free, it begs the question: Is
the unpaid internship worth it?
Benefits of an internship
Genevieve Harclerode, assistant director of
experiential learning and employer develop-
ment in the University's Career Center, said
internship experience has become a normal
expectation for most employers looking to hire
students after graduation.
"While not every employer in every field is

expecting that you've done four internships in
a field before you embark on an entry-level job
search, certainly we are seeing that employers
have a baseline expectation that you should be
able to articulate whyyou might be interested in
a certain industry," Harclerode said.
She explained that any kind of exposure to
a professional setting is beneficial not only for
employers to take students seriously, but for the
students themselves to decide whether or not a
certain field is the right fit.
Additionally, internships provide the oppor-
tunity for personal growth.
Amy Sumerton, program director of
826michigan, an Ann Arbor-based nonprofit
organization that helps elementary and high
school-aged students with their writing skills,
wrote in an e-mail interview that the fact that
the internships offered at the nonprofit are
unpaid has never posed a serious issue.
Sumerton said 826michigan has had interns
from all socioeconomic backgrounds, who are
always enthusiastic to volunteer their time. To
help facilitate those interns who are less privi-
leged, however, she said the program offers a lot
of flexibility in hours and work management.
"I think most of our interns understand that
they are getting a valuable experience for their
time, and doing something positive in their
community," Sumerton wrote. "They may not
get a paycheck for their work, but interns typi-
cally gain a bevy of marketable skills, a better
resume and a great letter of recommendation."
Ford School of Public Policy junior Abigail
Orrick said she enjoyed her unpaid internship
with the Department of Education over the
summer because it allowed her to communi-
cate directly with the high school students she
hopes to one day work with.
While she applied to both paid and unpaid
positions last summer, she said the Depart-
ment of Education was her number one choice,

despite beingunpaid.
"The best thing about an internship is you're
not just studying the material out of a textbook
or you're not just listening to somebody else
who's had that experience, you're doing it your-
self," Orrick said.
Still, had she not received a scholarship
through the Public Service Internship Program,
a program within the University that provides
resources and support to students interested in
pursuing public service-related internships in
Washington, D.C. over the summer, Orrick said
she wouldn't have been able to take her dream
internship.
Like others on the program, Orrick said she
set a strict budget during her ten weeks in D.C.,
and tried to make the remaining funds of her
scholarship last.
"I did coupon over the summer," she said,
laughing.
LSA senior Rachel Rowlands, who interned
with Glamour Magazine over summer 2013 -
before Cond6 Nast, the magazine's publishing
company, halted its internship program - said
living and working in New York City was a great
way for her to break into the publishing field,
despite not receiving pay for her work.
"I had a great time, I met some amazing peo-
ple," Rowlands said. "You can't really get better
first-hand experience than working with edi-
tors who do that everyday."
Internship hierarchy
For many fields, including government,
media, entertainment, fashion and nonprofit
work, an unpaid internship is standard prac-
tice. While this doesn't pose an issue for some
students at the University, Harclerode, from the
Career Center, said there are many students she
works with who need to take creative approach-
es to financing their summers.
Others, however, completely forego taking
the internship because they simply can't afford
to work for free. Harclerode said it's a sad situ-
ation for students who really want the experi-
ence, especially as employers come to expect it.
But just because a student can't afford to take
an unpaid internship, that doesn't mean she or
he won't be successful in future job searches.
Sumerton, from 826michigan, emphasized the
importance of enthusiasm and a demonstrated
interest in the mission of the organization as
key qualities ina potential intern or employee.
"We look for applicants who are motivated
and eager to learn things," Sumerton said.
"That, in my mind, is more important than just
about any kind of experience."
Harclerode too said most employers expect
to see that students have a demonstrated inter-
est in their field. Typically, employers won't
know the difference between a paid or unpaid
internship when they look at a resume.
While Harclerode thinks most employers do
prefer to pay interns, it isn't feasible for every
company, especially smaller businesses and
nonprofits. She noted that some companies,
such as NBCUniversal, have moved to a paid
internship program in recent years, perhaps in
light of the lawsuits and attention now devoted
to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
"I think that's a positive trend," she said.

"Any move towards compensating college stu-
dents is a good thing."
Pressure to succeed
While many of his freshman friends were
enjoying their first year at the University, Reyn-
olds, the General Electric intern, said he felt
immense pressure not only to find an intern-
ship, but to also support himself at the same
time.
While other interns used their first pay-
checks to buy new watches or televisions for
their apartments, Reynolds, who cannot rely
on financial support from his parents, was wor-
rying about paying for gas to travel to and from
work.
Orrick, too, said there was a definite divide
between students from different socioeco-
nomic classes in D.C., where most of the intern-
ship positions are unpaid. Although Orrick and
many others in PSIP budgeted consciously and
had help from scholarships, she said it was obvi-
ous that many other students didn't have the
same worries.
The financial constraints that some students
have is something employers should take into
consideration when developingtheir internship
programs, she said. As the income gap between
students in universities across the country
increases, the same disparity can be seen in
internships.
"I think there is a bit of an issue with it being
limited to middle and upper class students
doing internships because they're the ones
who can afford them," Orrick said. "It's cutting
those students out who would bring a lot to the
internship and to their employer but yet can't
financially do it."
A creative approach
Like the others, LSA senior Laura Goslin,
who interned in Congressman Dan Kildee's
(D - Mich.) office, had to think outside of the
box when it came to financing her summer in
D.C. In Goslin's case, this meant graduating a
year early so she could use the money she saved
from paying tuition to afford to live in one of the
nation's most expensive cities and work full-
time for free.
"I made a deal with my parents that they
would pay for housing," Goslin said. "I was just
really fortunate. I know if I didn't have that set
up I wouldn't be able to go."
While the unpaid internship isn't going away
any time soon, there are many resources across
campus that can help students take a creative
approach to funding their ideal internship
experience.
LSA Internship Coordinator Elizabeth
Pariano said she has witnessed the number of
internships growing over the past few years
as more students and employers recognize the
benefits of the experience. While this means an
increase in the amount of unpaid opportuni-
ties, she said it will also translate into more paid
positions in the future.
For those who find themselves struggling to
pay for their summer experiences, Pariano said
there are many resources for students to take
advantage of. For example, LSA students with

demonstrated financial need can apply for the
LSA Internship Scholarship, which can grant
up to $5,000 to subsidize internship costs.
"You need to be ready to ask one place and go
to another," Pariano said. "It's on the minds of
many of the people I talk with in these depart-
ments. I don't think a student should ever hesi-
tate to ask or inquire about it."
Additionally, Pariano is helping to develop
the LSA Internship Network, which will con-
nect LSA students with employers - including
LSA alumni - looking for interns. The data-
base will require employers to indicate wheth-
er the position is paid or unpaid, which is also
a requirement for jobs posted on the Career
Center's website currently. Pariano said many
students are able to "piece together" an appro-
priate amount of support through multiple
channels to afford to take an internship.
Hopefully, all of these resources will help
students secure not only their ideal internship,
but one that is paid for those who can't afford
to do it any other way. She said the University's
goal is to engage as many students as possible in
the process if they're interested in the experi-
ence.
"We'd like to be able to support as many stu-
dents as we can," she said. "I think it's impor-
tant to give them the options and facilitate the
options to open as many doors as we can."
Pariano emphasized the importance of the
individual student figuring out his or her needs
and taking the appropriate steps to accomplish
their own goals and ambitions. She encouraged
students to seriously consider what value they
will get out of an internship - paid or unpaid -
before they take it.
In some cases, this may involve students cre-
ating their own opportunities or taking a path
less traveled.
"That's a good thing, that there are so many
paths," she said. "There are opportunities to
take other kinds of work."
Harclerode also stressed that there are many
options for students who feel that they can't
afford unpaid internships. She suggested talk-
ing to employers about shortening the length
of the internship, looking for scholarships or
sponsors in the city of employment, considering
less expensive cities to work in that offer similar
opportunities and supplementing the intern-
ship with a paid job.
While it isn't the ideal situation, she encour-
aged students in financial straights to take
advantage of the resources provided on campus.
"Ultimately, I think anytime you have the
opportunity to be able to gain more exposure
and clarify career interests it's a positive thing,
but like I said, there's some resources out there
that would hopefully help support a student,"
Harclerode said. "I do think there are some stu-
dents who need to make difficult choices."
Reynolds seconded Harclerode, saying his
internship experience took a lot of planning and
budgeting. Still, he said all of the effort paid off
because of the experience he received.
"Even with all that planning ahead, it was
still was kind of hard to get started," he said."In
all, it really definitely is worth it."
