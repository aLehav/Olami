HARVEST FESTIVAL

After SACUA 

report, University 
updates complaint 
adjudication process 

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

The University’s Office for Insti-

tutional Equity has modified its 
procedures for investigating claims 
of faculty harassment and discrim-
ination, following a faculty gover-
nance report that alleged several 
flaws in the process.

The report, released in March by 

the Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs, cited the cases 
of three University faculty mem-
bers who were investigated by OIE 
over the past several years. Two of 
the three are no longer employed 
by the University.

According to SACUA, the report 

pointed to a lack of due process 
during parts of OIE’s investigation 
process, such as failing to provide 
adequate notice to respondents 
after a claim was filed and the 

inability to appeal decisions. 

In an interview with The Michi-

gan Daily last week, University 
Provost Martha Pollack said OIE 
implemented several changes in 
response to the report.

The biggest change, Pollack said, 

is a shift from a one-step to two-
step process for the initial meeting 
with a faculty member.

During an initial consultation 

with faculty, OIE will now describe 
the allegations against them as well 
as explain the OIE process. They 
will also stress that the respon-
dent cannot levy “adverse actions 
or consequences” against the com-
plainant for filing a grievance. 

The formal interview of the fac-

ulty member conducted for use in 
the OIE investigation will now be 
postponed to a second meeting. 
This interview was previously con-
ducted at the same time as the ini-
tial meeting in which respondents 
had a chance to learn the allega-
tions lodged against them.

“That gives people time to sort of 

understand what’s going on, gather 
information, be prepared to answer 
questions,” Pollack said.

Wolverines pass test, rout 
No. 22 Brigham Young, 31-0

Michigan handles 
Cougars easily in 
shutout victory

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

If No. 22 Brigham Young was 

supposed to be a test for the 
Michigan football team, the 
Wolverines passed.

The Cougars seemed to be 

a gauge for how far Michigan 
had come since losing its sea-

son opener at Utah. And on Sat-
urday, the Wolverines looked 
like a developed squad, trounc-
ing BYU, 31-0, in a game they 
owned the whole way.

Fifth-year senior quarter-

back Jake Rudock was 14-for-25 
passing, with one touchdown 
through the air and two more on 
the ground, and junior running 
back De’Veon Smith racked up 
125 yards and a score. Overall, 
Michigan dominated a ranked 
team at home, bucking an ugly 
trend from recent seasons. 
Coming into the game, Michi-

gan was 1-9 in its last 10 games 
against ranked opponents.

“In my mindset it was like, 

‘We gotta come out here and 
make a statement,’ ” said red-
shirt junior receiver Amara 
Darboh. “Do whatever it takes 
to win. And we got the job done, 
so that was good.”

Michigan coach Jim Har-

baugh opened up the playbook 
in the first half, showing new 
looks on offense that led to big 
gains early on. The new cre-
ative play calling was especially 
effective on Michigan’s second 

drive, which was arguably its 
best of the season.

First, Smith bounced to the 

left for a 31-yard gain to the BYU 
45-yard line. Then Darboh made 
a highlight-reel catch, pulling 
in an overthrown ball with one 
hand, then falling backward 
and securing a 21-yard recep-
tion. Redshirt sophomore tight 
end Khalid Hill went uncovered 
for 19 yards three plays later, 
and Rudock finished it off with 
a three-yard touchdown run at 
the 6:52 mark of the first quar-

University lawyers 

say admins can 
determine gun 
policy on campus

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

The University has defended 

its campus weapons ban after 
an open-carry advocate filed a 
lawsuit against the institution 
in June. 

In a brief to the Court of 

Claims, 
University 
lawyers 

argue that the state constitu-
tion allows the University to 
disregard the state’s open carry 
law.

Ann Arbor resident Joshua 

Wade filed the lawsuit after the 
University denied his applica-
tion for a permit to openly carry 
his gun on campus.

Weapons cannot be carried 

on campus by anyone other 
than law enforcement or the 
military. Weapons are some-
times permitted for educational 
purposes or for “extraordinary 
circumstances,” in which the 
director of public safety can 
issue a waiver. Wade filed for 
this waiver and was denied.

“The issue of firearm pos-

session on University property 
goes directly to the day-to-day 
operations of the institution,” 
the brief states. “It implicates 
the 
University’s 
judgments 

regarding safety, housing, and 
how best to foster an open and 
welcoming educational envi-
ronment — all matters central 
to the University’s function.”

Michigan state law says 

people with concealed carry 
permits are allowed to take 
guns into public areas, such as 
schools and churches, so long as 
the weapon is visible.

In a series of TED-style talks on 

Friday, a lineup of seven seasoned 
entrepreneurs talked risk-taking and 
innovation as part of an annual con-
ference to promote the University’s 
entrepreneurially minded organiza-
tions and departments.

Friday’s event, Entrepalooza, fea-

Participants use 
their own samples

By JULIA LISS

Daily Staff Reporter

Students in the University’s 

introductory biology lab now 
have the option to join a sec-

tion in which they perform a 
research study — with them-
selves as the subjects.

Biology 173 enrolls several 

hundred students each semes-
ter and normally follows a text-
book curriculum of common 
lab experiments. The new sec-
tion deviates from the standard 
curriculum: students will be 
both the researchers and sub-
jects of their own study.

Students will spend the 

semester studying the effect 
of dietary fibers — the parts of 
plant-based food the body can’t 
absorb or digest — on micro-
biome — or the full collection 
of microbes in a community, 
like the gut. They will test the 
levels of fiber in their own gut 
microbiomes before, during 
and after adding a fiber supple-

Michigan Daily celebrates 125 yrs

WE LCOME BACK , JETE R

125 years ago this week
The news landscape in Ann 

Arbor changed forever on Sep-
tember 29, 1890, when a group 
of University students pub-
lished the first-ever edition of 
The Michigan Daily. 

One hundred twenty-five 

years later, the Daily is the lone 
survivor in Ann Arbor’s daily 
news landscape, and it contin-
ues to serve a vital role in cov-
ering campus, the Ann Arbor 
community and beyond.

The Daily has a rich his-

tory of making and breaking 
news. In April 1955, the news-
paper was the first to report 
that Jonas Salk had success-
fully created an effective polio 
vaccine; a 1924 exclusive with 

Mahatma Ghandi shed light 
on the leader’s ongoing peace 
efforts in India and elsewhere; 
a football player’s permanent 
separation from the University 
for violating the Student Sexu-
al Misconduct Policy was first 
reported by the Daily in Janu-
ary 2013; the paper even acci-
dentally perpetuated the myth 
of Paul McCartney’s death in 
1969. 

36 years ago this week

The 
University’s 
work-

study program received fed-
eral funds to increase the 
program’s annual budget from 
$1.74 to $2.5 million.

The budget increase result-

ed from the federal Middle 

Income Assistance Act, passed 
in November 1978. With its 
passage, the allocation of fed-
eral resources for work-study 
programs increased across the 
nation.

The University’s Board of 

Regents hoped a larger work-
study budget would help stu-
dents with the increasing costs 
of school, such as rising tuition 
and housing rates.

Though the work-study pro-

gram was never meant to com-
pletely cover student tuition 
costs, the increased budget 
aimed to help students on the 
border of being financially 
unable to attend the University.

‘Internet Cat Festival’ draws 
200 students to North Quad

Fourth annual 

festival draws over 

500 students to 
student-run farm

BY ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Sustainable food enthusi-

asts gathered at the Matthaei 
Botanical Gardens on Sunday 
for the fourth annual Harvest 
Festival. Organized to pro-
mote environmentally sus-
tainable food, Sunday’s event 
drew an estimated 500 people 
to the garden’s student-run 
farm.

The University of Michigan 

Sustainable Food Program, 
an umbrella organization for 
food-related student groups 
on campus, sponsored the 
festival. During the academic 
year, the program works to 
facilitate relations between 
the 
groups 
by 
providing 

resources, helping with out-
reach and fostering collabora-
tions.

“This is our one big event 

we have each year and we just 
try to raise awareness about 
sustainable food and where 
people can access it around 
campus,” said LSA senior 
Claire Roos, the program’s 
communications coordinator. 

Entering the farm, visi-

tors were handed a ticket 
for the complimentary food 
tents from Ann Arbor eater-
ies, including The Brinery, 
Salads Up and Lucky’s Mar-
ket. Tables from several of 
the program’s member groups 
promoted options for getting 
involved with sustainability 
efforts on campus.

Recently doubled in size, 

the sustainable farm now 
includes a food forest, or a 
more forest-like farming site, 
just outside the farm’s fence.

LSA senior Maddy Baroli, a 

representative from the orga-
nization Permaculture, was 
the driving force behind the 
food forest.

“The basic idea is to move 

away from the industrial agri-
culture framework of mono-
cultures and tons of pesticides 

and fossil fuels by imitating 
forest ecosystems,” she said.

The 
festival 
featured 
a 

variety of activities. The first 
ever pie-eating contest drew 
a large crowd, and Andrew 
Jones, assistant professor of 
environmental health scienc-
es, claimed first prize.

“It was a little disgusting,” 

Jones said. “The first few 
bites were tasty but after that 
it was all about concentration 
and pure determination.”

The event also featured a 

scarecrow contest with origi-
nal submissions from various 
student organizations.

University 
alum 
Angey 

Wilson, Permaculture’s pro-
gram coordinator, said the 
event’s organizers and par-
ticipants are a critical part of 
the event’s success.

“It’s a great way to enjoy the 

presence of all these fantastic 
people in one space because 
you’re all working together 
for the same cause — having 
sustainable food available and 
accessible for all students.”

Students, staff dress 
in whiskers, cat ears 
for programming 
board’s kickoff event

BY TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

Students and staff dressed in 

cat ears and whiskers, consum-
ing cat-themed cake and snacks 
filled the courtyard of North 
Quad Residence Hall on Friday 
evening. They were waiting for 
the Internet Cat Video Festival 
to begin.

North Quad Programming 

hosted the event for an audi-
ence of about 200 students, 
staff and Ann Arbor residents. 
Emilia White, programming 
coordinator of North Quad, said 
she got the idea from the Walk-
er Arts Center in Minneapolis.

“When I saw it and saw sort 

of what a festive event it is, I 

thought it would be a good event 
to have at the beginning of the 
semester to kick off the semes-
ter with a sense of community 
and bring people together,” she 
said.

The 
Walker 
Art 
Center 

curates a video compilation of 
various viral cat videos into 
genres like “drama” and “com-
edy” every year and had more 
than 10,000 attendees at its 
most recent premier.

“It is sort of a mutual under-

standing — something that peo-
ple share across cultures and 
differences is that people love 
cat videos,” Smith said. “The 
festival is about watching cat 
videos as a community, versus 
what most people do in their 
home or in their private room 
or office watching cat videos.”

LSA juniors Christine Liu 

and Jenny Gong found the fes-
tival through Facebook. Gong 
said though she is more of a 
dog person, she was interest-
ed in the event because she’s 

never been to a cat film festival 
before.

“It sounded like something, I 

don’t know, I’ve never heard of 
anything like it before, so I just 
wanted to have the new experi-
ence,” Gong said. “I think cats 
do really weird things some-
times, like sometimes they 
don’t make any sense. I guess it 
makes sense to them, it doesn’t 
make sense to us, and I guess 
that’s what makes it so funny. 
How they’re so fascinated with 
laser pointers and things like 
that.”

Liu said she was looking for-

ward to the festival because it 
would be a way for her to relax 
from homework and school-
related activities.

“I just think they’re like a 

good relaxation tactic, because 
you can get lost really eas-
ily watching cat videos, or 
maybe that’s just me,” she said. 
“They’re just light-hearted; you 
can’t really go wrong with cat 
videos.”

This year’s festival was dedi-

cated to Cecil the Lion, a pro-
tected African lion shot and 
killed by an American dentist 
earlier this year.

Gong said her favorite video 

featured a cat attempting to 
jump through a window and 
flailing its arms and legs.

For Liu, her favorite video 

was self-explanatory.

“The title is literally ‘Cat gets 

caught barking by human and 
resumes meowing’ and that’s 
exactly what happens in the 
video,” Liu said. “If you haven’t 
seen it, it’s honestly hilarious.”

Faculty members can still opt 

to complete the interview during 
this first meeting.

Another addition: A standard-

ized e-mail template will be used 
when OIE contacts the subject 
of a complaint and is designed to 
ensure proper communication of 
all the necessary information. For 
the first time, a faculty member 
can also review the statements 
they’ve made to OIE before the 
investigation report is finalized.

SACUA first began examin-

ing OIE’s policy in 2012, when 
the faculty grievance monitor 
— who is responsible for moni-
toring 
complaint 
procedures 

but has no power to impact the 
process — raised concerns about 
OIE’s procedures. After several 
formal complaints were filed 
about OIE by faculty members, 
SACUA’s Faculty Hearing Com-
mittee began an examination of 
the OIE’s procedures.

SACUA chair Silke Maria-Wei-

neck, professor of comparative lit-
erature, said in an interview with 
the Daily on Wednesday that, 
overall, Pollack and OIE were 
receptive of the report.

She said she’d still like to 

see several additional changes, 
including the right for faculty to 
appeal decisions.

“The thing we’re still talking 

about is students have the right 
to appeal OIE reports,” she said. 
“But for faculty there’s no such 
right to appeal, so we would like 
to see that. So we’re talking about 

that. At this point this is not an 
adversarial thing — this is peo-
ple sitting together and trying to 
work it out.”

Weineck also said she’d like to 

see changes to departmental pol-
icy so that if an OIE investigation 
doesn’t find any misconduct, the 
subject of the investigation can-
not then be sanctioned by his or 
her department or dean.

“That seems to me a very, very 

basic principle — that if you’ve 
basically been found innocent, 
then you cannot be punished for 
whatever it is you have done or 
are alleged to have done,” she 
said. “And that has not been the 
case. Faculty have been disci-
plined in the wake of reports of 
no findings and that troubles me 
rather deeply.”

According to a description of 

the OIE process on the University 
Human Resources website, even 
if an investigation finds no dis-
crimination or harassment, the 
University may still take action 
against an individual if they are 
“found to have engaged in inap-
propriate workplace behavior.”

SACUA’s report also asked for 

the verdicts in the three cases 
cited in the report to be over-
turned, a request that Weineck 
said was denied and the body 
wouldn’t pursue further.

“It doesn’t mean I’m happy 

about it,” Weineck said. “But I 
think sometimes you know when 
you will not get anywhere.”

Daily Staff Reporter Genevieve 

Hummer contributed to this report. 

special adviser to Detroit Mayor 
Mike Duggan, and several start-
up founders, many of them Uni-
versity alums.

Kay presented her speech as 

a fireside chat, and emphasized 
the importance of raising girls 
to take risks, which she said play 
a major role in successful entre-
preneurship.

“I had to be pushed out of 

my comfort zone, into some-
thing that felt like a risk for me, 
in order to learn that I had the 
ability to learn,” Kay said. “Our 
young women are such stars 
and they’re working so hard 
and they’re being so perfect, but 
they’re kind of missing out on 

some skill-learning that would 
actually equip them better.”

Reflecting on her own experi-

ence, Kay urged the next genera-
tion of women to not let gender 
stereotypes confine them.

“Let’s encourage our girls to 

be bad girls,” she said. “Rather, 
not to be inherently good girls all 
the time. This stereotype — girls 
who are good girls, who are per-
fect — is not healthy.”

After her speech, Kay said she 

is particularly interested in find-
ing ways to “get more women to 
the top” — not only in business, 
but in politics, the military and 
other organizations. 

“What an event like this does 

is encouraging women to take 
risks, to set up ventures, to be 
prepared to fail at them,” Kay 
said. “And that’s really a lot of 

what we’re doing is with con-
fidence. How do we encourage 
women to go as far as their tal-
ents mean they deserve to go, but 
that they perhaps don’t have that 
self-belief?”

During his talk later in the 

day, Dworkin discussed diver-
sity in the arts and emphasized 
educational opportunities where 
students can make tangible con-
tributions to their fields of study.

“We need to educate and train 

our students to be relevant to 
their field of study, which means 
having a demonstrable, sig-
nificant impact on their field of 
study.”

Dworkin also underlined the 

importance of helping students 
find work they’re enjoy and find 
fulfilling.

“Our graduates will be excit-

ed, they will get jobs, they will 
be well paid,” he said. “But most 
importantly, they will wake up 
every day doing the work that 
we helped empower them to feel 
passionately about.”

Tommy Jakubiec, an Eastern 

Michigan University freshman 
who attended Friday’s event, 
said he appreciated the oppor-
tunity to learn from experienced 
entrepreneurs, 
particularly 

because he can use their advice 
in running the online business 
he created several years ago.

“I want to get some more 

inspiration,” he said. “Sitting 
in keynotes of people that have 
been through the same thing 
that I’m trying to pursue, they 
always offer goals and tips and 
techniques.”

that numerous opinions from the 
Michigan Supreme Court and 
the Michigan Court of Appeals 
indicated the administration has 
expansive authority over its affairs 
and property. Because carrying a 
gun would directly relate to Univer-
sity operations, the lawyers argue, 
the issue falls under the University 
administration’s jurisdiction.

Wade’s attorney, Steven Dulan, 

filed a brief last week denying the 
University’s right to ignore the open 
carry law and arguing the Universi-
ty’s Board of Regents has no author-
ity to dismiss laws enacted by the 
state legislature.

“The 
Michigan 
Constitution 

vests the power to legislate with the 
state legislature, not with the state 
universities,” Dulan wrote.

“The 
university 
will 
vigor-

ously defend its right to regulate 
weapons on campus to ensure the 
safety of students, faculty, staff, 
patients, health-care providers and 
hundreds of thousands of visitors, 
and to foster a supportive learning 
environment where students and 
faculty can feel free to explore chal-
lenging topics without fear of vio-

lence,” University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald wrote in a July e-mail to 
the Detroit Free Press. “We expect 
to file a response to the lawsuit in 
accordance with the deadline estab-
lished by the Court of Claims.”

LSA senior Daisy Belden, presi-

dent of the University’s chapter 
of Young Americans for Liberty, 
a group comprised of libertarian-
leaning students, says the Univer-
sity is not exempt from the laws 
dictated by the state constitution. 
Belden says students and commu-
nity members have a right to carry 
arms on campus with a permit “to 
protect themselves and others.”

“The state constitution recog-

nizes the right to carry arms and 
the University is bound by the con-
stitution,” Belden said in an e-mail. 
“It cannot and should not infringe 
on that right, or any other right, just 
because they dislike it.”

She says at the very least, the 

University should let the case play 
out in the Court of Claims because 
it has legitimate grounds.

Wade previously openly carried a 

handgun into a choir concert at Pio-
neer High School in Ann Arbor in 
March, drawing community back-
lash and generating debate over 
open carry laws.

A hearing date to vote on dis-

missing the lawsuit has not been set.

ment to their diets.

Tom Schmidt, professor of 

ecology and evolutionary biol-
ogy, was one of the founders of 
the new section. He said he saw 
the need for a more research-
oriented option for beginning 
science students.

“We want to provide every-

one with the chance to see how 
real research is conducted and 
how conclusions are drawn from 
research,” Schmidt said.

He added that it is a chal-

lenge for many science students 
to find jobs in professors’ labs at 
the University, so the curriculum 
may offer skills taught in those 

highly sought after lab positions. 

LSA sophomore John Klein 

said he applied to take the class 
because it sounded more inter-
esting than the normal Biology 
173.

“It’s going to be more work for 

sure, but I think it’s going to be 
worth it for me in the long run,” 
Klein said.

To fund the project, Schmidt 

received a $1.5 million grant 
through the Howard Hughes 
Medical Institute. The grant also 
allows for a parallel section in 
the Chemistry 125/126 course.

The students who were inter-

ested in taking the class submit-
ted a short application and were 
randomly selected through a lot-
tery system. The section began 
last winter with 40 students. In 

its second semester, the section 
doubled to 80 students.

Even with the larger class 

size, Schmidt said there were 
still more students hoping to 
take the class than there were 
available spots, which were lim-
ited by the number of microbi-
ome samples the lab’s equipment 
could process.

The data obtained from the 

students 
will 
contribute 
to 

Schmidt’s 
own 
microbiome 

research, allowing students to 
feel like they impacted a larger 
scientific discovery.

Schmidt said he hopes under-

graduates in the section will dis-
cover if they have a passion for 
research.

“We want to provide under-

graduates with an authentic 

research experience that they 
can use to determine wheth-
er they want to continue in 
research,” he said.

Arvind Venkataraman, pro-

fessor of internal medicine and 
microbiology and immunology 
in the Medical School and pro-
fessor of ecology and evolution-
ary biology in LSA, is another 
instructor of the course. In an 
e-mail to The Michigan Daily, 
he wrote the research could help 
children facing malnutrition.

“Malnutrition causes 45 per-

cent of child deaths worldwide,” 
Venkataraman wrote. “Recently, 
it has emerged that persistence 
of malnutrition is strongly relat-
ed to deficiencies in functions 
normally provided by the gut 
microbiome.”

ter.

The Cougars threatened on 

their next possession, getting 
the ball as deep as the Michigan 
36-yard line, but redshirt junior 
defensive 
end 
Willie 
Henry 

sacked BYU quarterback Tanner 
Mangum to stall the drive. At that 
point, the Wolverines’ suddenly 
efficient offense went back to 
work. Rudock led them down the 
field and, after BYU jumped off-
side on an important 4th-and-1, 
grabbed a 14-0 lead on a touch-
down pass to Darboh.

From there, Michigan’s defense 

grew stingy. Beginning with the 
Cougars’ first possession of the 
second quarter, the Wolverines 
held BYU to six straight three-
and-out drives, suffocating any 
slim chance for a comeback. It was 
Michigan’s first shutout against 
a ranked opponent since 2003, 
when it beat Notre Dame, 38-0.

“You almost get into that rhythm 

where you get on the field and you 
expect three and out,” said senior 
defensive end Mario Ojemudia. 
“You’ve got to focus on what your 
assignment is, and I think that no 
one is getting too relaxed because 
we keep playing well.”

Through four games, the Wol-

verines have given up just 38 
points, an average of 9.5 per game.

And while the defense has been 

the team’s anchor, Michigan’s 
offense will end up on highlight 
reels. 

Perhaps the game’s biggest play 

came on Michigan’s fourth drive. 
Smith ran up the middle and disap-

peared into the trenches for what 
looked like a three- or four-yard 
gain. But seemingly out of nowhere, 
he emerged from the scrum and 
sprinted 60 yards for a touchdown, 
toying with and carrying BYU’s 
would-be tackler, Michael Davis, 
for the last 35. His touchdown 
stretched the lead to 21-0.

Rudock tacked on another 

touchdown, and by the end of the 
first half, the Wolverines led, 31-0.

While the Cougars stayed 

within one point of No. 9 UCLA 
last week, they appeared to run 
out of gas against Michigan. After 
taking a big lead, the Wolverines 
did the same thing in the second 
half as they did in their previous 
blowout wins over Oregon State 
and UNLV, pounding the ball and 
finishing off another quick game.

“I don’t think we were really sur-

prised,” Darboh said. “Before the 
game, Coach Harbaugh said, ‘Do 
whatever it takes to win.’ And then I 
think that got everyone pumped up, 
and we went out there, and I think 
we had a dominant win.”

There was only one worri-

some outcome for Michigan all 
game. Smith went down with 7:36 
remaining in the third quarter 
and had to be carted off with a 
right ankle injury. Smith was put 
in a walking boot, but a Michigan 
spokesman said it was precau-
tionary. After the game, Smith 
said he expected to play next 
week against Maryland, and his 
focus was squarely on the win.

“It feels good to finally beat a 

ranked team,” Smith said. “We have 
to keep the momentum going and 
keep making statements ... to show 
that we don’t fear ranked teams.”

Rapists. Illegals. Drug traffickers.
These are just a few of the terms used in 

recent months to describe people who look 
like me. They’re spread through social media, 
through talk radio, and through presiden-
tial hopefuls on the national stage. They have 
fueled a sometimes nasty, and often inaccurate, 
debate about immigration in the United States. 
Along the way — amid all the pain and vitriol 
— they have created a huge opportunity, one on 
which our generation must take the lead.

The current dialogue about immigration 

has once again put Latinos in the United 
States at the forefront of national discussion. 
And the fact that it’s not the caliber of con-
versation our Latino communities deserve 
means we have the chance to change it; it’s 
our chance to have our voices heard.

As a teacher in a majority-minority city 

in California where nearly all of my stu-
dents identified as Latino, I often bonded 
with my kids over our shared culture. We’ve 
swapped stories about eating tamales around 
the holidays and shared photos of siblings’ 
 

quinceñeara celebrations.

Ours became a true, inclusive community. 

I beamed with pride as my kids welcomed a 
new student who spoke no English with open 
arms, eagerly translating for her and helping 
her study flashcards to pick up the language.

But I also watched with a sinking heart 

as my kids navigated situations they didn’t 
deserve. During my second year of teach-
ing, one of my students and his older brother 

came into school with his head down, looking 
shaken. Their parents had just been deported. 
As we scrambled to ensure they had a place to 
stay, the boys wondered when they would see 
their family again.

Reflecting back, I know that my kids’ 

pain and progress was part of something 
that extended far beyond the walls of our 
classroom. Across the country, Latinos lag 
behind their white counterparts in every-
thing from high school graduation to reading 
and math performance. This has nothing to 
do with ability or will. It’s a direct reflection 
of systemic gaps in educational opportunity 
according to race, class and zip code. And 
with our country’s entire population moving 
toward majority-minority, unless we address 
these gaps, we will soon live in a country 
where the majority of students are behind.

When I first came to the University, I knew 

I wanted to work in public policy, but I didn’t 
know teaching would be such a foundational 
part of my path. Every day, as I work to advo-
cate for the legal rights of special-education 
students, I’m grateful that I followed my gut. 
When I learned about Teach For America, 
the mission of expanding opportunity for 
low-income students and the experience of 
working in a high-need community resonated 
deeply with me. After three years in the class-
room, I went to law school because I wanted 
to effect large-scale change in the systems 
that were inhibiting my students’ and their 
families’ pathways to success. Now, I’m a 

Exceptionalism and diplomacy

Advocating for Latino students

T

he last time a president was elected, 
millennials didn’t have the impact 
on the election they probably wished 

they had.

According to the Pew 

Research Center’s analysis 
of a 2013 U.S. Census 
Bureau report, America’s 
generation of adults born 
after 1980 accounted for 
25.5 percent of eligible 
voters, and that portion 
should 
increase. 
As 

millennials grow older, the 
report states, their share of 
the electorate is expected 
to blossom to 36.5 percent 
by 2020.

As the political relevance of millennials 

grows, it will be interesting to see how they 
shape 2016 and future election cycles. The 
colleges and universities of America have 
a long-established tradition as hotbeds for 
political debate.

However, assuming their advisers had the 

foresight to glance at the voting data from the 
2012 election, politicians today probably do 
not seek out university venues in the hopes of 
reaching out to young constituents.

Pew also reports that 41.2 percent of 

eligible voters aged 18 to 24 turned in a ballot 
in 2012 — more than a 7.3-percent decrease 
from 2008. This pales in stark comparison 
to the 71.9 percent of Americans aged 65 and 
older who cast ballots in 2012, for example.

Look around Ann Arbor today. Campaign 

signs are cropping up like weeds amid the 
flyers and sidewalk billboards that perennially 
bloom on campus.

It’s clearly evident that “Feel The Bern” and 

“Ready for Hillary” signage is more prevalent 
here than “Make America Great Again.” The 
one time I did see a Donald Trump T-shirt, 
it was coupled with a Hawaiian one, and I 
assumed it was worn ironically.

As the Republican Party continues to 

implode, someone has been canvassing the 
University with Democratic catchphrases. 
We know it isn’t the students, because if 
one applies Pew’s report to the University’s 
population, it seems like less than half of them 
care enough to vote.

Whoever 
the 
friendly 
neighborhood 

Democrat may be, he or she seems to be having 
an effect on the national stage. Friday, the 
New York Times announced that two and a 
half weeks before the first Democratic debate, 
Bernie Sanders has built a strong lead in the 
New Hampshire primary polls that will hold 
even if Vice President Joe Biden were to throw 
his hat in the ring.

The resiliency of Sanders’ campaign is 

impressive for a man who paints himself 
so vividly as a far-left socialist. In the Fox 
News era of journalism, where news outlets 
are more concerned with political ideology 
than the standards of ethical journalism, 
it’s remarkable that Sanders hasn’t been 
scorned as an enemy of the state or something 
similarly ridiculous.

No doubt that Sanders benefits from being a 

white man. If he were a minority or a woman, 
his campaign and position on issues would be 
bombarded by attacks from conservatives like 
Donald Trump, who appear to chase doses of 
xenophobia with a swigww of misogyny at 
breakfast time.

It’s tiring to explain again how Sanders is a 

socialist on a mission to take the money power 
out of politics and Wall Street. With so much 
time remaining before the primary election, it 
seems repetitive, but it’s important.

The early success of Sanders’ campaign is 

a political miracle that will only grow more 
impressive the longer his current uptick in 
popularity maintains. To paraphrase the 
activist Saul Alinsky: Money and people are the 
two sources of political power.

Sanders has alienated himself from big-

money politics, more so than anyone on the 
conservative side of the aisle, more so than 
Hillary Clinton. And this is what may cost 
Sanders as the election grows nearer.

In a typical campaign, candidates spend 

months and millions convincing voters to 
believe in them. Sanders must spend his time 
convincing those who believe in him to vote 
at all. His status in the polls is impressive, 
but they’re generated by research groups 
 

seeking responses.

CNN might just come to your house, or at 

least call you up on the phone, to see which 
candidate you’re leaning toward at the 
moment, but voting is a totally voluntary task. 
If you don’t take the initiative to cast a ballot 
on Election Day, you won’t be getting a call 
from the county clerk.

Everyone but the government might ask you 

how you’ll vote next election season.

The worst-case scenario for Sanders is 

if the ones spreading his leaflets across the 
country and this campus are the college 
students — young people filled with ideals, 
but who can’t find their way to the voting 
booth. It’s interesting to consider exactly 
why a 74-year-old senator resonates so loudly 
with the youthful masses, but that’s another 
conversation all together.

Because Sanders’ name doesn’t have serious 

financial backing (by choice of his own), he 
relies solely on the support of real ballots. Point 
is, the hashtags are helpful for now, but they 
won’t get Sanders the Democratic nomination. 
Millennials are a growing percentage of 
potential voters, and the most likely to voice 
their support of a candidate online, but they 
still have disappointingly low voter turnout.

Separate from the politician, Sanders’ idea 

of the taking money out of politics serves the 
best interest of every individual who doesn’t 
own or operate a super PAC. What Sanders 
is preaching is that he won’t be bought or 
influenced by anyone.

Millennials eligible to vote should do the 

same. Cut through gross political spending by 
casting ballots — not for Sanders, necessarily, 
but for positive self-interest.

T

he 
Middle 
East 
is 
a 

complicated place. Divided 
by 
ethnicity, 
political 

affiliation 
and 

religion, 
over 

the last century, 
arbitrarily 
set 

boundaries have 
forced different 
peoples 
to 

attempt working 
in unity. That’s 
to say, outside 
powers such as 
Britain, France, 
Spain 
and 

Italy 
meshed 

competing 
interests 
together, 

fusing their land, resources and 
interests. During the transition to 
independence, these boundaries 
became 
legitimate 
national 

borders. (To be fair, teachers and 
students around the world have 
rehearsed this history lesson, but 
it’s something we must not forget).

Since World War II, many of the 

colonizers have tried picking up 
the pieces, repairing the strife they 
created in the Middle East — either 
for national gain, security, develop-
ment or a confluence of the three.

Then came America.
Through arming rebels, sup-

porting dictators or advancing war, 
the United States has gone to great 
lengths in order to secure its inter-
ests and stabilize the region. Much 
of our role in the Middle East, and 
the world at large, is due to the 
belief in “American exceptional-
ism”: an idea promoting America as 
unique in its valuing of individual-
ism, liberty, egalitarianism and the 
free market. This concept, while 
spirited and momentarily empow-
ering, has led the United States 
to militarily intervene when it’s 
unjustifiable or unnecessary, acting 
often as the world’s police. Fortu-
nately, there are numerous ways to 
promote peace, diplomacy and pro-
tect our interests abroad without 
using brute force. In short, “peace 
in the Middle East” can be achieved 
through humanitarian efforts that 
develop nations from the ground 
up, and welcoming refugees and 
immigrants 
whenever 
possible, 

thereby helping people directly. 

The current Syrian refugee cri-

sis is a wake-up call, demanding a 
reformation of what international 
diplomacy in this region — and 
around the world — should look 
like. In the midst of human chaos 
and tragedy, the United States can 
have a role in honoring human 
rights, prosperity and global secu-
rity. By providing more Syrians 
refuge, we can protect humans, 
raise our image as a benevolent 
world actor and, yes, develop our 
 

own nation.

Unfortunately, many politicians 

are unwilling to accept refugees 
because they see it as funneling ter-
rorism to the motherland. To me, 
that’s straight Islamophobia.

Regardless of your perspec-

tive, though, there’s an important 
lesson in this — America’s hubris 
has created, or influenced, inter-
national conflict. Specifically, the 
concept of American exceptional-
ism has prompted congressmen to 
support the bombing of insurgents 
and propagate war. But wheth-
er or not you believe American 
exceptionalism is justified, it’s still 
important to recognize the oppor-
tunity and responsibility America 
has to facilitate global security 
 

and development.

Advancing educational, health 

and economic sectors, accepting 
immigrants and promoting vital 
civil societies where people express 
and maintain freedoms in the 
developing world is our most effec-
tive weapon against terrorism.

Let’s now return to the current 

refugee crisis.

We can’t support dictator Bashar 

al-Assad as we’ve done with lead-
ers who’ve propagated all sorts 
of crimes and rebel groups who — 
momentarily — act for liberating 
or democratic causes (or simply, 
causes that are in our best inter-
est). In Syria, we’ve already spent 
$41 million on rebel forces. It’s not 
going well.

We can’t send in the Air Force 

to remove Assad — as we know the 
horrifying power vacuum created 
in Libya when assisting in efforts to 
remove Gadaffi.

We can’t bomb our way through 

Syria with American force, like 
Bush’s war in Iraq and President 
Barack Obama’s drone strikes in 
Pakistan. These actions destroy 
foreigners’ 
trust 
in 
America. 

Referring to drones, in particu-
lar, one Georgetown professor is 
quoted saying, “(Drones) have the 
right to kill anyone, anywhere on 
Earth, at any time for secret rea-
sons based on secret evidence in 
a secret process undertaken by 
 

unidentified officials.”

But not using drones and war 

tactics doesn’t mean we can’t do 
anything for Syrians. We can open 
our doors to them.

When discussing refugee acqui-

sition or immigration, it’s impor-
tant to note that taking in refugees 
is not a zero-sum game. If America 
allows refugees in, refugees will 
return the favor. I’ll skip over the 
psychological, security and eco-
nomic benefits it provides to refu-
gees, and just mention the benefits 
for America. Yes, in the short term 
America will pay for housing, Eng-
lish lessons and job training, but in 
the long term, this will yield divi-
dends for the United States. Refu-

gees, more than immigrants and 
natives, are more likely to start 
small businesses. Additionally, Syr-
ian refugees are consumers, and, as 
such, will benefit local economies. 
The quicker a nation can help them 
assimilate, the faster they will help 
that nation.

So far, the United States hasn’t 

done enough. Since September 
10, we’ve accepted 1,500 refugees 
and some senators have pushed to 
accept 65,000. That’s good, but way 
behind Germany’s 98,700 and Tur-
key’s 1.9 million.

On a grand scale, though, Ameri-

ca’s foreign policy agenda is shifting 
in a better direction — toward more 
foreign assistance and less force; 
more diplomacy and less excep-
tionalism. In an interview, Obama 
recognized the need to combine 
“national security” and “foreign 
assistance.” Here, he refers to stra-
tegic efforts — supplying aid work-
ers, restructuring criminal justice 
systems and developing economies 
— as more critical in the world than 
leveraging our military.

Still, there’s room for improve-

ment. Less than 1 percent of the 
U.S. budget goes to foreign aid, 
while 17 percent is committed to 
defense. As the president himself 
said, they need to be treated as one 
and the same.

Just as we cannot colonize our 

way to economic development or 
stability, we cannot dominate how 
a country operates economically, 
socially or politically. However, we 
can facilitate development. We can 
fund technology, health, educa-
tion and business sectors. We can 
invest in economies of the develop-
ing world like China does in Africa. 
We can aid in the progress of other 
countries as partners — expanding 
the global economy and making 
things safer for the United States 
and the world.

Foreign policy predominantly 

run by humanitarian efforts — 
educating world citizens, keep-
ing them healthy and raising their 
standard of living — has another 
implication: becoming a nation for 
the good. People will, in turn, look 
to the United States as benevolent, 
helping the development of their 
country. Syrians citizens will want 
to travel here, acquire American 
goods and make friends, there-
by promoting global safety on a 
local and state level, not funneling 
 

in terrorism.

This form of diplomacy isn’t easy. 

Diplomacy and global peace is a 
slow process.

But there are no quick and dirty 

tricks for solving global crises, and 
diplomacy is our best option.

When our national conversation

to scream or walk away. It’s easy 
to fall victim to doubts that any-

so they can thrive. My students

TV COLUMN

Who’s a TV author?
L

ast spring, I enrolled in a 
class called “Hitchcock and 
Modernity.” I’m a certified 

Hitchcock fanatic and freely spend 
my time writing unassigned essays 
about “Ver-
tigo” and the 
male gaze, so 
the opportu-
nity to learn 
about some 
of my favorite 
movies in a 
class setting 
was impos-
sible to pass 
up. Still, as I 
clicked the 
“register” button, something about 
the course’s title made my skin 
crawl. Hitchcock and Modernity. 
Like countless other English classes 
at the University, this course would 
be focused on a single author and 
his body of texts, noting repeated 
themes and language and analyzing 
their significance — but authorship 
in film is not as simplistic as this 
method implies.

Critics and academics have 

been looking at movies this way for 
over 50 years. Writers for a French 
film journal called Cahiers du 
Cinema coined the term auteur to 
describe a superior group of direc-
tors. Their movies would always 
be more interesting and deserv-
ing of analysis than those written 
by their second-rung (metteur en 
scène) counterparts, because these 
authors possessed more talent than 
just technical competence and the 
ability to tell actors to move around 
a room. An auteur imbued his 
films with his own personal touch, 
and each stroke of genius could be 
traced back to his other movies and 
the patterns analyzed for mean-
ing. The theory was later adopted 
by American critics, who added a 
whole mess of qualifications to be 
an auteur: An auteur’s movies must 
get better and better for his whole 
career, he had to have a godlike 
command of how his story was 
told and surpass all the financial 
and creative difficulties that the 
other hacks working on his movie 
presented him with. At the end, the 
auteur’s movie would stand as a 
singular representation of his vision 
and innovation.

This theory began to lose steam 

in the years following the 1960s as 
other critics pointed out the flaws 
in the auteur logic. Choice directors 
like Orson Welles and Hitchcock 
didn’t make amazing movies for 
their whole lives, and any of the 
second-tier filmmakers probably 
could have made a film less bloated 
than Welles’s “F for Fake.” And 
what about the other authors of 
movies — screenwriters, who have 
just as much a hand in creating a 
film’s symbolism and meaning? 
What about women and filmmakers 
of color, who often aren’t afforded 
the same opportunities to rise 
above studio restrictions with their 
cinematic voices intact? And what 
about TV, where directors don’t 

hold quite as much esteem, and it’s 
anybody’s guess who will end up 
getting public credit for creating an 
acclaimed TV show? With all these 
inconsistencies, the auteur theory 
has died and been laid to rest in the 
pages of my film theory textbook. 
Well, almost.

Since “The Sopranos” kicked off 

the “Golden Age” of TV, the small 
screen has become the new hot spot 
for powerful cinematic authors. It’s 
the series’ showrunner who usually 
gets the auteur treatment, because 
he holds a role similar to the movie 
director. In most TV writers’ rooms, 
the decisions for plotting the season 
and formulating character arcs 
rest with the showrunner. Because 
many series feature the work of 
multiple writers and directors in a 
given season, the auteur crown goes 
to the person who sits on throne 
and makes everything happen. This 
logic isn’t without fault.

A few weeks ago, I talked to a 

high school friend about “Breaking 
Bad,” and she must have name-
dropped Vince Gilligan 60 times. 
Among other accomplishments, Gil-
ligan is apparently the man to thank 
for Skyler White’s amazing char-
acter development, her becoming 
more steely and fearless with every 
passing episode. Gilligan may have 
set up Skyler’s story trajectory and 
maybe written a few of the episodes 
himself, but a huge part of the praise 
should go to Anna Gunn’s strong 
and stunning performance. It’s a 
crime not to mention Gunn’s name, 
or Michael Slovis’s for cinematog-
raphy or Rian Johnson’s directon 
of that awesome scene with the 
knife. Vince Gilligan belongs in any 
discussion of “Breaking Bad,” but 
the show is great because of the col-
laboration of hundreds of talented 
people apart from the guy whose 
name appears as the closing image 
of every episode.

Auteur logic has gotten even 

messier in recent years, because 
showrunners aren’t the only ones 
on a pedestal anymore. Big-name 
producers often dominate the 
conversations of their respective 
shows largely because of advertising 
strategies. People are more likely to 
watch a show if it has a recogniz-
able pedigree. Shonda Rhimes, the 
showrunner of “Grey’s Anatomy” 
and “Scandal,” is marketed as the 
sole creator of “TGIT” Thursdays 
on ABC: “Grey’s,” “Scandal” and 
“How to Get Away With Murder” 
are all fun primetime soaps cen-
tered around compelling women 
in high-powered jobs. However, 
ABC does not really care if anybody 
knows that Peter Nowalk is the 
showrunner of “How to Get Away 
With Murder,” and technically has 
as much influence in creating the 
story arcs of his show as Vince Gil-
ligan has for “Breaking Bad.” ABC 
can manipulate viewers’ knowledge 
of Rhimes as a proven TV auteur 
— “HTGAWM” was one of the 
highest-rated network dramas dur-
ing its run last fall, and at least some 
of its success is due to fans’ loyalty 

to Rhimes’s empire.

The showrunner is also not 

as infallible as he may seem, and 
his esteem depends upon the 
excellence of the team who sup-
ports him. Cary Fukunaga’s adept 
directorial work on the first season 
of “True Detective” was unlike 
almost anything on TV — his iconic 
minutes-long tracking shot and the 
way he and his supporting cinema-
tography team shot the lush and 
dreamlike Louisiana landscape 
made the first season appear as 
something out of a Southern Gothic 
novel. Despite the fact that crit-
ics (including myself) applauded 
Pizzolatto for the moody writing 
and compelling characters, in 
retrospect, he couldn’t have been 
the singular auteur of that season. 
In isolating Pizzolatto and taking 
away the stunningly talented Fuku-
naga, Matthew McConaughey and 
Woody Harrelson, the show’s ridic-
ulous writing comes into clearer 
view. The first season also had silly 
dialogue masquerading as MFA-
smart (never forget that “time is a 
flat circle”), but it sounded damn 
philosophical coming out of the 
mouth of an Academy Award-win-
ning actor. Tell Vince Vaughn to say 
those same words, and … somehow, 
the effect isn’t the same.

Evidently, issues of authorship 

are still very relevant. TV fans and 
critics worship the cult of the show-
runner, but not invariably — pro-
ducers, stars, writers and directors 
often slip through the cracks and 
gain authorial status. Marketing 
plays a huge role in who audiences 
designate as an author of a show. 
Commercials for USA’s “Mr. Robot” 
proclaim that the show was created 
by “a producer of ‘True Detective,’ ” 
and early ABC publicity sells “The 
Catch” as a TGIT Shonda Rhimes 
original (then-showrunner Jen-
nifer Schuur’s name is nowhere to 
be found). The new TV auteur is 
singlehandedly responsible for cre-
ating his shows, improbably flouting 
the network standards and restric-
tions to deliver excellent content 
that only becomes more excellent 
when it’s analyzed and picked apart 
for clues of the author’s genius.

The production of TV traces 

back to the collective work of 
hundreds of craftsmen, network 
executives and businesspeople and 
the audience itself — as has been 
proven in film, the TV showrunner 
is not a unilateral creator of mean-
ing. But there are still freshman 
boys who toss off-hand comments 
about “House of Cards” featuring 
the calling cards of David Fincher’s 
oeurve. And there are still classes 
at the University of Michigan that 
operate under the assumption that 
one man’s singular genius was 
enough to override everyone else’s 
working on that movie, enough to 
make those films his.

ALBUM REVIEW

By KENNETH SELANDER

Daily Arts Writer

In mid-late Fall 2014, my good 

friend 
Zach 

introduced 
the 

rap-loving 
fac-

tion of my friend 
group to Fetty 
Wap, who had a 
song that’d been 
getting airplay in 
the tristate area. 
Zach 
is 
from 

New 
Jersey, 

and told us Fetty lived 15 minutes 
away from him and had one seri-
ous song at the time, “Trap Queen.” 
We listened and were impressed – it 
definitely had its own vibe. “Trap 
Queen” was something different. 
It would go on to blow up a month 
later that winter. The sequence of 
one seven three and eight has never 
been so hype.

First off, Fetty Wap is a super 

easy guy to like. The Vines I’ve seen 
of him joking about his trademark 
missing eye show a friendly per-
sonal side, and he comes across as a 
humble and genuine dude.

Another huge positive charac-

teristic many see in Fetty is that he 
has a refreshing, unique and new 
sound. Moving beyond the general 

public’s timeless love affair with 
“Trap Queen,” the sum of the parts 
that compose Fetty Wap’s vocals 
is unique on the whole, even if the 
major individual components seem 
recycled.

T-Pain was the first time I’d 

heard auto-tune seriously used for 
singing in hip hop. He had his day 
in the spotlight, and nowadays auto-
tune has taken off amongst rappers 
who don’t seriously sing (i.e. Young 
Thug, Future). Fetty’s sound brings 
me back to seventh grade sleepaway 
camp where I first heard “Buy You 
a Drank,” by T-Pain, but Fetty has 
a yodeling vibrato that does set him 
apart from other vocalists today. On 
occasion, Fetty will also engage in 
leaned-out mumblings that a num-
ber of Atlanta rappers use today.

So, after throwing on the head-

phones and giving Fetty Wap several 
listens, I’ll summarize: meh.

If you take out the four hit songs 

that you and I have heard 100 times 
and already love, all of which were 
released far in advance of Fetty Wap 
dropping, I’d give this album a C. 
“Trap Queen” and “679” were on Up 
Next, “RGF Island” was on Zoo Style 
and “My Way” was on the 1738 Remy 
Boyz mixtape and then remixed 
with Drake in July.

For me, these releases killed a lot 

of the hype. Technically the songs 
are on the record, so I include them 
in my grading, but I’m sad to say that 
none of the other 16 tracks on Fetty 
Wap live up to the excitement or 
quality these songs already created 
for him well ahead of the album.

I give Fetty Wap a disappointed 

B-, but damn, Fetty can do a hook 
and chorus right. For this reason, I 
think Fetty needs to limit Monty’s 
(aka Montana Buckz) presence on 
his tracks. Yes, they gel on “679,” but 
not on “My Way,” or “No Days Off.” 
Fetty needs better rappers to match 
his energy – like when he teamed up 
with Gucci and Quavo on his “Trap 
Queen” remix. His music is all about 
energy, and Monty’s lyrical callous-
ness and frequently awkward flow 
can’t keep up. Even one of Gucci 
Mane’s better-than-mediocre vers-
es that got cut and pasted into “Trap 
Queen” while he’s locked up flows 
well.

I get keeping true to his Remy 

Boyz, a theme on a majority of his 
songs on Fetty Wap, and trying to 
put them on. But if Fetty wants to 
further improve his outlook as an 
artist, I think he needs to work on 
recruiting upper echelon talent for 
his own albums going forward, not 
just being a feature on other artists’ 
tracks.

CHVRCHES’ ‘Every 
Open Eye’ pulsates

ALBUM REVIEW

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

I can’t lie — I only got turned on 

to the brilliance of CHVRCHES, a 
three-piece Scottish electronic 
extravaganza, 
some 
six 

months 
ago. 
After 

falling 
down 

a 
YouTube 

rabbit hole one 
night, I came 
across 
their 

cover of Arctic 
Monkeys’ 
“Do I Wanna Know?” As this 
was easily one of the best songs 
of 2013, how anyone could do a 
cover any justice — I didn’t wanna 
know. CHVRCHES had some 
seriously misplaced audacity. So 
reluctantly, I clicked, and about 
five seconds later was proven 
so wrong. Sexy, gripping synths 
guided by desperate, pint-sized 
vocals filled the studio. It was 
enticing, exciting and inventive 
just like the original, but served 
the starkest contrast, too. My 
view count to this day probably 
ranks in the hundreds.

And so goes the band’s bumping 

sophomore release, Every Open 
Eye — it’s beautifully defined by 
the characteristics rife in the 
cover video, and each listen brings 
something fresh to the ears. Sad-
yet-happy dance beats permeate 
as Scottish pixie lead singer 
Lauren Mayberry coos over lost 
loves and electronic hope. She’s 
apathetic with delicious little 
dashes of passion: an appealing, 
variety-laden 
combination, 

persuasive to the listener at best. 
Backed up with the magic synth 
fingers and occasional vocals of 
Iain Cook and Martin Doherty, 
Every Open Eye rarely strays from 
its predestined greatness.

It’s hard to believe this is a 

sophomore release for the Scots, 
who’ve been around since 2011. 
They brought their sound to the 
electronic world with their first 
album, The Bones of What You 
Believe, and it’s only gotten better 
with age. It’s distinct, refined and 
akin to only them, avoiding any 

forthright genre clichés (i.e., d-d-
drop the bass, Spanglish Pitbull 
raps and so on). “Clearest Blue” 
off the new album is no exception. 
The scene it sets: a steamy, neon 
club, pulsating with energy right 
from the start. Things get epic 
after the meaty, German dance 
hall beats drop at 2:15 and stay 
raving and jumping and sweaty 
until the finish. What’s that on the 
bottom of your club heels? Glitter 
and infinity.

“Never 
Ending 
Circles” 
is 

a strong opener and similar 
in 
its 
unwavering 
liveliness. 

Interesting, tiny synth quirks 
weave their way in and out, as 
they do on “Leave a Trace” and 
“Empty Threat.” All the songs feel 
a bit experimental but never lose 
that CHVRCHES listening factor, 
and Mayberry’s voice should 
take a lot of that credit. It’s hard 
not to keep discussing it because 
it’s crucial — almost as if Hayley 
Williams (Paramore) inhaled a 
substantial breath of helium, in 
the least annoying way possible. 
“Empty Threat” sounds like it 
could be an Anime theme song, 
or the accompaniment to one of 
those shady, low-quality YouTube 
videos devoted to Anime ships 
and lovers. Yet — always yet 
— CHVRCHES music is still 
alluring, still prodigious.

Sometimes, 
though, 

consistently high-octane tempos 
and driving synths can get 
repetitive. Fast-paced tunes in 
a sequence can’t slow down, 

content-wise, and, unfortunately, 
the album’s vibes glitch a bit on 
“Keep You On My Side” and “Make 
Them Gold.” It’s not that these are 
pitiful songs — they’re actually 
quite good. But “good” becomes 
a problem when every other 
velocity-driven ditty is fantastic 
and unique. The weak handful’s 
typical synths, lyrics and melodic 
lines are boring, especially when 
the band has proven — just a song 
earlier — that they can do better, 
more inventive work.

“Bury It” and “Playing Dead” 

turn it around with their hopeful 
lyrics, and “High Enough to Carry 
You Over” and “Down Side of Me” 
do the same. The latter two feature 
Cook singing with Mayberry and 
taking some lines entirely himself, 
which all lends to cool, Human 
League-esque 
trade-offs 
and 

juxtaposition.

Mayberry sings us away with 

“Afterglow,” the only slow, calm 
track on the compilation. The 
group was initially reluctant to 
include it, as the original cut was 
techy like the rest of Every Open 
Eye, but on the last day of recording 
they stripped and slowed it down. 
Mayberry laid down all the vocals 
in a single, emotional take. It 
sounds raw like that: like the 
aftermath of a wild rave, laying 
down in the middle of the dance 
floor after all is gone but your one 
true love, confetti in your hair, 
neon lights still flickering with 
every bit of hope you felt when 
you first got there.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Over the past several years, 

the 
Muppets 

have become 
increasingly 
prevalent 
in 
culture. 

Starting 
with the 2011 
film 
“The 

Muppets,” 
which 
was 

a 
modest 

success 
for 
Disney, 

they’ve 
been 

making 
appearances in a wide array 
of talk and variety shows. 
Their 
renaissance-of-sorts 

continues with a new television 
show on ABC. At its core, 
“The Muppets” is a workplace 
sitcom that happens to star 
the Muppets instead of human 
actors; it has the same beats 
and humor as a conventional 
sitcom. These characters have 
jumped between genres (from 
children’s television to heist 
movies), but this show crosses 
into 
more 
standard, 
adult 

fare. It strips away some of 
the energy of the recent film 
iterations of the characters, but 
once it settles into its rhythms 
and style, it could become one of 
the better sitcoms on network 
television.

“The Muppets” takes place 

behind 
the 
scenes 
of 
the 

fictional late night show “Up 
Late with Miss Piggy.” Her 

ex-boyfriend, Kermit the Frog, 
is 
the 
executive 
producer. 

Other Muppets fill various 
roles throughout the show, 
including Gonzo and Pepe the 
Prawn as staff writers, Fozzie 
as the warm-up comedian and 
announcer and Animal as, of 
course, the drummer in the 
band, to name a few.

“The Muppets” ’s weirdest 

aspect is how it puts these 
adored 
characters 
into 

conventional 
sitcom 
roles, 

using 
the 
mockumentary 

format popularized by “The 
Office” and “Modern Family.” 
The most prominent of these 
tropes involves the relationship 
between 
Kermit 
and 
Miss 

Piggy, who are presented as 
fighting exes, having broken 
up a few months before the 
pilot. The romance between 
the characters has been a key 
part of their shared history, 
but the show chooses to go in 
a different direction (in fact, 
Kermit is porking a new pig, 
Denise). Yet, the way the two 
characters interact is identical 
to most “will-they-won’t-they” 
couples who are in a lull. There’s 
a coolness to every scene they 
share.

It’s not just the romance 

subplot that relies on sitcom 
conventions; “The Muppets,” 
developed by Bill Prady (who 
co-created 
“The 
Big 
Bang 

Theory”) 
and 
Bob 
Kushell 

(“3rd Rock from the Sun”), uses 
other sitcom tropes to middling 
effects. The Muppets universe 
has utilized a wide array of 

Hollywood talent. The first 
episode guest stars Elizabeth 
Banks (“The Hunger Games”) 
and Tom Bergeron (“Dancing 
with 
the 
Stars”), 
both 
of 

whom earn laughs by playing 
themselves. Plus, Jere Burns 
(“Justified”) 
continues 
his 

streak of giving the best reaction 
shots on television, playing the 
father of Fozzie Bear’s human 
girlfriend. However, the show 
uses the sitcom trope of trying 
to keep two people separated at 
all costs (in this case, Banks and 
Piggy) only to have them meet 
each other in a big blowout. 
It’s no fault of Banks’s, but 
the seven-minute sequence is 
awkward and humorless.

It’s a little disappointing that 

this show is a different version 
from other stories with the 
characters, because the scene 
like the powerful closing of the 
2011 film (with the characters 
getting together and singing 
“Rainbow Connection”) can’t 
exist in this world. (Though 
a 
performance 
by 
Imagine 

Dragons did add a necessary 
musical 
element.) 
However, 

it’s hard to knock the show for 
not doing something it’s not 
trying to do. “The Muppets” 
attempts to be something more 
conventional and adult, but it’s 
doing a shaky job of achieving 
those 
goals. 
The 
executive 

producers of this show are 
seasoned 
veterans 
in 
the 

comedy world, so it’s not hard to 
imagine it growing and finding 
its distinct voice. However, it’s 
just not there yet.

ALBUM REVIEW
Drake and Future 
don’t deserve hype

Buzzy mixtape 
doesn’t bring fire

by RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

The diamond emoji found its way 

into every phone’s “recently used” 
section on Sunday night, when 
Drake and Future dropped their 
collaborative 
mixtape, What A 
Time To Be Alive. 
The cover image, 
a 
stock 
photo 

of some bright-
ass 
diamonds, 

seems an unusu-
al choice for the 
artists’ collabo-
ration – until you 
remember 
that 

it’s 2015. Oh, and 
what a time it is 
to be alive — a time of Vines and 
memes, hashtags and retweets. 
And so the diamond emoji littered 
my Twitter feed — and the com-
ment section of Meek Mill’s Insta-
gram — because that’s exactly what 
Drake and Future intended for it to 
do.

Even before the tape debuted 

on Drake’s OVO Sound Radio, the 
Internet was already in a frenzy. 
For weeks, there were rumors of 
a mythical project in the works. 
Coming off of successful summers 

— Drake’s If You’re Reading This 
It’s Too Late went platinum and 
Future released the highly antici-
pated DS2 — there seemed to be a 
spark catching between the two. 
And then when Meek Mill, first, 
claimed Drake used a ghostwriter 
and, second, told a DJ to turn off a 
Future song at his Made In America 
Festival set, he ignited the fire.

Unfortunately, this fire is out-

shined by that now-relevant dia-
mond emoji; the tape’s Internet 
presence is stronger than the 
actual content on the tape. It’s 
already been memed, tweeted, Ins-
tagramed and whatever the fuck 
else you can do on the Internet. Its 
lyrics have already settled nicely 
under Instagrams because Drake 
and Future know their audience. 
They know we prefer sound bytes 
to full-length songs and emojis to 
actual words.

And when the two biggest rap-

pers in the game announce a col-
laboration, it almost goes without 
saying that it won’t live up to the 
hype (Watch the Throne, anyone?). 
They have radically different styles, 
making it hard to create a cohesive 
sound. The result: DS2 scraps with 
Drake features on them. Because of 
trap-heavy production by Future’s 
go-to guy, Metro Boomin, Drake 
sounds completely out of place. 
And, let’s be honest, can anyone 
understand what the fuck Future is 
saying? If you can make out words 

through his codeine-induced mum-
bling, you realize he’s actually rap-
ping about some serious shit. And 
then we get Drake, still just, like, 
talking about women. The tension 
between their chosen subject mat-
ter makes it, at times, almost awk-
ward to listen to. Like in “Live From 
the Gutter,” we feel like Future’s 
actually been there, and Drake — 
well — he definitely hasn’t.

Still, the tape is not without 

strengths. “Jumpman” is a straight 
banger — one of Future’s verses 
is just “NOBU, NOBU, NOBU, 
NOBU, NOBU, NOBU.” “Change 
Locations” gives us the Drake-iest 
Drake verse we’ll find on the tape 
— “2 in the morning, my mind is 
on you / 4 in the morning, it still 
hasn’t 
moved.” 
“Scholarships” 

finally manages to meld together 
Drake’s pop-like delivery and 
Future’s trap-like production per-
fectly.

And part of the appeal of the 

whole project, the initial reason 
the Internet exploded, was its 
unlikelihood. These two artists 
don’t need each other’s help. They 
didn’t need to collaborate, and see-
ing as they reportedly recorded in 
a mere six days, it doesn’t really 
seem like they had the time to 
either. They did it purely for us.

So it doesn’t matter if you find 

the diamond emoji luminous or 
lack-luster because, chances are, 
it’ll be around for a while.

TV REVIEW
‘Blindspot’ tries to 
elevate usual drama

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

A gray duffle bag rests in 

the middle of a crowded Times 
Square. Amid the mass of 
people, a sole police officer 
notices 
the 

bag and reads 
the 
red 
tag 

attached 
to 

it, 
“Call 
the 

FBI.” 
Cut 
to 

a 
now-empty 

metropolis, 
a 
lone 
bomb 

squad 
officer 

walks 
toward 

the bag through 
the 
desolate, 

LED 
screen-

lit streets. He feels for wires, 
but instead finds movement. 
Stumbling back, he watches a 
naked woman emerge, covered 
head-to-toe in ornate tattoos. 
Dazed, the woman looks out at 
the world, trying to cover her 
eyes from the harsh brightness 
of her new reality.

Taken into custody by the 

FBI, the woman, known only 
as Jane Doe (Jaimie Alexander, 
“Thor”), has no memory of who 
she is or what happened to her 

— completely lost in her own 
existence.

It’s a hell of a hook devised 

by creator Martin Gero (“L.A. 
Complex”) to introduce viewers 
to his latest series, “Blindspot.” 
Produced 
by 
the 
prolific 

Greg Berlanti (“The Flash”), 
“Blindspot” offers up a visually 
enticing concept for a series 
 
— tattoos containing clues to 
solve a crime — while remaining 
generally 
formulaic 
in 
its 

execution and structure.

Using the crime-solving duo 

trope that has been common 
since the days of Sherlock Holmes 
and John Watson, “Blindspot” 
pairs Jane with FBI agent Kurt 
Weller (Sullivan Stapleton, “300: 
Rise of an Empire”), whose name 
happens to be tattooed on Jane’s 
back. This pairing of an authority 
figure 
with 
an 
unknown 

wildcard is highly overused in 
this TV season — new shows like 
“Minority Report,” “Limitless” 
and 
“Rosewood,” 
which 
all 

incorporate 
variants 
of 
this 

formula. However, “Blindspot” 
allows itself to stand out from 
its contemporaries by giving the 
more intriguing maverick role to 
a woman.

Alexander is “Blindspot” ’s 

best asset, portraying the trau-
ma Jane has undergone with 
a vulnerable humanity. Jane’s 
like a child in many ways — she 
understands the world and how 
it works, she but lacks a sense of 
belonging within it. While dra-
matic scenes like Jane breaking 
down as she looks at herself pro-
vide emotional gravitas, small 
moments truly give Alexander 
the ability to flesh out her per-
formance. In one such scene, 
Weller tells Jane she should 
get some food to eat. Her quiet 
response, “I don’t know what I 
like,” reflects how lost Jane real-
ly is as Alexander stares, wide-
eyed, looking for answers.

Stapleton, 
unfortunately, 

has less to work with than his 
onscreen 
partner. 
Weller 
is 

given, in many ways, a parental 
obligation to Jane, trying to 
guide this complete unknown 
through the world, and these 
moments give Stapleton his 
best opportunities to display a 
dynamic character. But, Weller, 
as of right now, is given minimal 
character detail. He has no 
home, family or anything to 
distinguish his work and private 
life from each other. It goes 
to show that by the end of the 
episode, more information is 
given about Jane’s cryptic past 
than Weller’s present situation.

Jane’s search to uncover the 

secrets of her past brings her 
to work with Weller. In this, 
Jane finds purpose, as she goes 
into the field alongside Weller 
when one Chinese tattoo gives 
the day’s date and an address. 
As 
the 
layers 
of 
mystery 

behind the markings unravel, 
so do the layers of Jane Doe. 
Certain aspects of her past life, 
including expert marksmanship 
and 
fighting 
skills, 
slowly 

unfold throughout the episode. 
While 
the 
show 
relies 
on 

the 
relatively 
traditional 

procedural 
crime 
structure, 

“Blindspot” lifts up its approach 
by adding a personal motivation 
of self-discovery for the show’s 
protagonist.

“Blindspot” relies on well-

known storytelling methods that 
are essential to the crime drama 
genre. However, it introduces 
enough reconfigurations to its 
layout to make its premise not 
feel completely derivative, and 
uses its talented lead to sell 
the emotional necessity of each 
weekly case.

ALBUM REVIEW
Disclosure’s misstep

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

Disclosure knows what works 

for them — a radio-friendly com-
bination of rolling house beats and 
soulful vocals. While the response 
to this tem-
plate on their 
first 
album, 

Settle, 
was 

overwhelm-
ingly positive, 
following 
the 

same mold on 
a second record 
may have been 
a misstep for the English duo. As 
is sung on “Echoes,” “Such repeti-
tion calls for concern.”

Bringing back Sam Smith, as 

well as numerous other heavy-
hitters, Disclosure is flexing their 
newfound star-power. Artists like 
The Weeknd, Lorde, Miguel and 
Gregory Porter all make cameos, 
each catering their voices to Dis-
clocure’s electro-soul sound. The 
record’s first track, “Nocturnal” 
feat. The Weeknd, is by far the lon-
gest song on the album and plays 
like a remix of a remix of a pre-
existing song by the artist. It plays 
on both of the artists’ strengths — 
Abel Tesfaye’s syrupy vocals and 
Disclosure’s funky-house beats.

The second track features 

Smith of “Latch” – “Omen” 
is clearly trying reconjure the 
popularity of it by highlight-
ing Smith’s silky voice and 
Disclosure’s blooming, crescen-
do-ing beats. But while catchy 
and dynamic, “Omen” still lacks 
the playful, infectious nature of 
“Latch.”

“Holding On” feat. Gregory 

Porter is the only song on the 
album that doesn’t start with a 
recurring beat, but rather with 

a powerful cry from Porter. The 
track continues in typical Dis-
closure fashion from there on – 
establishing a basic beat, layering 
in a repetitive chorus and inter-
jecting a brief bridge.

The peak of the record comes 

in Lorde’s feature on “Magnets” 
and “Jaded.” Lorde’s vocals are 
unlike any other featured on the 
album, cheekily bobbing in and 
out of the melody, with a staccato 
singing style that complements 
the succinct backbeats of the track 
perfectly. Moving into “Jaded,” 
the same kind of punctuated bass 
beats are used in combination with 
the duo’s UK garage sound and 
expressive vocalization.

From that point forward, little 

is done to break the monotony of 
each track. The rolling, punch-
ing beat of “Superego” and the 

smoky chorus of “Masterpiece” 
attempt to pull the second half 
of the album up from its droning 
trenches, but they ultimately fall 
short. The signature groove-based 
beats of Disclosure may have been 
able to carry them on Settle, but 
even with its myriad of big-name 
features, Caracal is in need of a 
little something extra. While not 
overtly unpleasant or dull, the 
tracks simply lack diversity. Cara-
cal would be perfect sprinkled 
throughout a house party mix but, 
when listened to in one sitting, 
blends together into an unidentifi-
able mush.

Disclosure’s reliance on guest-

star appearances caused them to 
forget what made them so suc-
cessful in the first place — their 
innovative sound. Settle was so 
well-received because it pushed 
the boundaries of what Top 40 
music could and could not do 
— “Latch” was a game changer. 
Instead of continuing down their 
inventive path, Disclosure stuck 
with exactly what worked in the 
past. Though Caracal delivers the 
kind of sound that Disclosure fans 
have come to love, it also leaves 
listeners reaching for something 
more — and it just isn’t there.

Michigan 31, BYU 0

Wolverines earn long-awaited 

blank slate with dominant 
performance against BYU

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Tanner Mangum bounced from teammate to 

teammate in the huddle — shouting and clapping 
along the way.

It was 3rd-and-8 for No. 22 BYU late in the 

second quarter, and the Cougars were already 
down, 28-0, to Michigan. What would normally 
appear 
as 
encouragement 
from 
the 
BYU 

quarterback was instead desperation obvious to all 
108,940 fans in attendance.

But those with the best view were just across 

the line of scrimmage. Like sharks, the Michigan 
defensive players silently waited for their chance 
to attack. They saw in the water, again.

BYU had already attempted 15 pass plays, and 

Mangum — against a pass rush unlike any he had 
seen all season — took two sacks, scrambled three 
times and managed just two completions.

Then, Wolverines brought a steady rush again, 

and forced Mangum into his ninth incompletion of 
the afternoon.

With its third straight three-and-out, BYU 

might as well have given the game to Michigan 
for good with the ensuing punt. But if you ask the 
rapidly ascending Wolverine defense, they’d tell 
you the game was over much sooner.

“We sensed blood in the water from the first 

snap of the game,” said senior defensive end Mario 
Ojemudia. “They looked good on film, they’ve 
played some good teams and had a lot of good 
games, but we came out (in practice) and prepared 
well. Everything we saw in the game, we saw in 
practice.

“We executed very well, we got the goose egg 

and I’m very proud of that.”

Mangum regressed toward the mean in the 

second half, finishing 12-for-28 for 55 yards. 
Nonetheless, the Cougars were shut out for the 

first time in 143 games, mustering a measly 105 
yards of total offense.

After looking otherworldly at times to begin his 

career at BYU, Mangum looked like a freshman 
against the Wolverines.

Whether it was the pass rush swarming the 

backfield, forcing Mangum to roll out early, or the 
suffocating man coverage in the secondary that 
left the sideline as the most appealing receiving 
target, Mangum’s magical start drowned in the 
sea of maize at Michigan Stadium.

Dialing up the pressure up front, and sticking 

to BYU’s highly touted receivers downfield, 
Michigan used a team effort to earn a shutout it 
had wanted since almost getting one last week 
against UNLV.

“It’s great to be a part of a shutout,” said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. “Everybody did 
a great job — players, coaches, everybody. When 
you only give up 105 yards, that’s really special. We 
were outstanding in so many areas.”

One-third of the way into the 2015 season, 

defense has been the crown jewel of the 
Wolverines, who rank 10th nationally in tackles 
for loss and were 13th in scoring defense before 
Saturday’s shutout.

Even after the shutout, Ojemudia said he 

had hoped his unit could force more turnovers. 
Because with eight returning starters and three 
current or former defensive coordinators on the 
coaching staff, the expectations are not only high, 
but enforced.

“You have so many great minds out there on our 

coaching staff, and they expect the most out of us,” 
Ojemudia said. “They expect shutouts every game, 
and if we don’t live up to that, we’re not living up to 
our expectations.”

Added senior defensive lineman Ryan Glasgow: 

“You always feel good after a shutout, but we 
have expectations we’ve set for ourselves that we 
haven’t come close to meeting yet.”

The defense tasted blood Saturday, and even 

reached its ultimate goal of preying on the 
playmaking Mangum.

But like sharks in the water, the Wolverines are 

hungry for more.

Bloodthirsty defense 
finishes shutout win

P

oor Michael Davis.

The BYU cornerback did not deserve the 

fate that befell him 

Saturday afternoon. His only 
folly was attempting to stop 
De’Veon Smith.

It was a task that other 

men have completed 199 
times during Smith’s college 
career. But on this carry, 
when Smith crossed Brigham 
Young’s 35-yard line with 
11:45 remaining in the second 
quarter, Davis was not destined 
to be among them.

Smith had started the run on Michigan’s own 

40-yard line. He was stopped briefly at the line of 

scrimmage, forced so low to the ground that he 
believed he was down. But Smith kept going — he 
emerged from the scrum alone.

Davis streaked down the field to his left. The 

cornerback put two arms on Smith when he crossed 
the 35-yard line, grappling with his shoulder pads, 
but it was of no consequence. Smith broke free at the 
30-yard line, but Davis stayed on the trail. He flailed 
at Smith’s upper body for 10 more yards before 
making one last attempt.

Davis grabbed Smith’s body as he crossed BYU’s 

20-yard line, jostling his body in a circle. But as 
Smith completed his turn at the Cougars’ 10-yard 
line, Davis still latched on.

At the same moment, Smith used the force of 

the spin to make one final push with the back of 
his arm, the 

Smith’s run says it all 

about Michigan

Restoring a tradition

O

ne of the most revered 
game-day traditions 
at Michigan Stadium 

has held 
steady since 
1962, before 
legendary 
coach Bo 
Schembechler 
even started 
his tenure. 
Moments 
before game 
time, the 
Michigan 
football 
players and coaches run out 
of the tunnel together, jump 
and hit the “GO BLUE” banner 
at midfield, with the band 
surrounding them and playing 
“The Victors.”

Moments like those don’t just 

happen.

On the Tuesday before 

every home football game, the 
Michigan Athletic Department 
holds a meeting to discuss 
logistics for that week’s game. 
Those include parking, tickets, 
food and all of the other factors 
in bringing 100,000 people to 
sit in one stadium to watch a 
football game — all in a town 
with a population not much 
higher than the stadium’s 
capacity.

Then, on Thursday, the 

spirit department (which is 
comprised of the marching 
band, cheerleaders and dance 
team) meets with the event 
presentation staff to script the 
entire game down to the minute, 
largely to divide time between 
playing music piped over the 
loudspeakers versus music from 
the Michigan Marching Band.

Therein lie some of the 

biggest decisions of the week 
when it comes to creating a 
positive experience for the fan 
base. Elsewhere in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
prepares his team for the 

week’s game. But the process of 
reclaiming past glory after years 
of turmoil takes place just as 
much off the field as it does on it.

Fans grew unhappy with 

former athletic director Dave 
Brandon’s tenure long before 
the on-field product took a 
downward spiral. Before then, 
there were high ticket prices, 
corporate sponsorships and 
high volumes of canned music. 
Many people longed for the 
way things used to be, and after 
three straight high-energy, 
noon-kickoff, blowout wins 
at Michigan Stadium, they’re 
starting to get their wish.

Saturday brought the 

Wolverines’ toughest home 
opponent of the young season. 
It was another noon kickoff, yet 
the stadium was loud throughout 
the game — especially, of course, 
when Michigan dominated then-
No. 22 Brigham Young in the first 
half en route to a 31-0 victory.

So what comes first, the 

winning or the energy? This year, 
both have returned, perhaps 
sooner than people expected. 
After Harbaugh arrived, the 
enthusiasm crept back up and 
the Wolverines started winning. 
One fed the other, until all of a 
sudden Michigan garnered a No. 
22 national ranking and people 
started wondering what could 
happen this year instead of years 
down the road.

Part of the energy dates back 

to August, when during the first 
week of the Michigan Marching 
Band’s summer rehearsals, the 
band received a special visitor. 
He spoke to the band for about 
15 minutes before a rehearsal, 
according to band director 
John D. Pasquale. Perhaps it 
was powered by “Enthusiasm 
Unknown to Mankind,” as the 
speaker likes to call it. That 
speaker was Harbaugh.

Harbaugh’s main message, in 

the words of drum major Matt 

Cloutier: You’re in control of how 
well you perform. That day, the 
coach voiced his support for them 
and gave some motivation. He has 
gotten pretty good at the latter 
part: He has fired up the entire 
Michigan fan base over the nine 
months he has been on the job.

Harbaugh is more of a 

“traditionalist,” as Pasquale 
called him, and so is his boss, 
Interim Athletic Director Jim 
Hackett. Together, they have 
rallied everyone together in an 
effort to erase months — or years, 
depending on how you define it — 
of struggles on and off the field.

Pasquale has never met 

Hackett in person, but he has 
emailed with him and met with 
some of his staff to coordinate 
game-day decisions. One of 
those decisions goes back to 
the debate between canned 
music and marching band, a 
hotly contested issue in recent 
years, again between the 
traditionalists and the new-age 
audience.

The philosophy regarding 

piped-in music versus the band 
is largely passed down from 
the athletic director. Pasquale 
had a strong relationship with 
Brandon and 
harbors no ill 
will toward 
him, but under 
Brandon, 
canned music 
had become 
popular at 
Michigan 
Stadium.

In April, Hackett told 

students at a fireside chat that 
he asked Harbaugh about piped-
in music the day he introduced 
him as coach. “I don’t care. We 
don’t need it,” Hackett recalled 
Harbaugh saying.

Hackett agreed, and so the 

Athletic Department has shifted 
back toward the band.

“Hackett’s vision is a bit 

more traditional, historical, 
old Michigan-themed 
environment,” Pasquale said. 
“We are going back to the basics. 
We turned down the decibel 
levels of the scoreboard, which I 
do think is pretty obvious to the 
fan base.”

He 

acknowledged 
that the 
canned music 
has its merits 
at different 
points during 
the game. On 
big defensive 
third-down 

situations, the loud gong over 
the speakers generates more of 
an effect than the band could. 
It’s about creating the best 
atmosphere possible inside the 
stadium.

“The entire point is the 

stadium psychology or the 
crowd psychology, trying to 
keep the energy moving in 
that place so that it doesn’t get 

stagnant,” Pasquale said. “Not 
that it will, but there are times 
when the energy drops down a 
bit, and it’s our job to always try 
to keep it going. It’s a constantly 
moving and evolutionary 
equation.”

The biggest difference comes 

heading into and out of TV 
timeouts, when the band gets 
most of its exposure.

“This is how the spirit of 

Michigan is,” Pasquale said. 
“This is what Michigan football 
is about. It’s about the team, 
it’s about the band, it’s about 
the pageantry, it’s about the 
tradition and the history. That’s 
what we’re aiming to get back 
toward.”

The band feeds and in turn 

responds to the crowd energy, 
which again comes back to 
Harbaugh, Pasquale believes. 
The first-year coach has had 
tremendous success so far, 
especially at home. This season 
has brought more touchdowns, 
and thus more of “The Victors,” 

and thus more touchdowns and 
so on.

As different as the Michigan 

Stadium experience has been for 
fans this season, on the field and 
off, it has been just 11 months 
since Hackett replaced Brandon 
and nine since Harbaugh 
replaced Hoke. So what is still 
left to improve?

“That’s a good question, and 

that’s one I don’t know that I 
can answer,” Pasquale said. 
“I think we continue to build 
upon what’s already happening, 
because it’s successful. Like, ‘If 
it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”

Brandon used the opposite 

motto: “If it’s not broken, break 
it.” One year after the disastrous 
fall of 2014, some things still 
need fixing. But when Michigan 
led 31-0 on Saturday and the 
band played on, everything 
seemed just fine.

The good, the bad and the 
ugly: Michigan vs. BYU

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Editor

To Michigan football coach 

Jim Harbaugh, there’s almost 
nothing as beautiful as a 31-0 
shutout. That the blowout win 
over No. 22 Brigham Young 
vaulted the Wolverines into the 
top 25 for the first time since Nov. 
2, 2013, is simply icing on the 
cake.

Harbaugh said after the game 

that Michigan seems to be coming 
together as a unit, and in many 
ways looks better than expected.

The Daily breaks down the 

good, bad and ugly from the 
Wolverines’ dominant win over 
the Cougars.

The Good

The short answer is that 

pretty much everything was 
good. But as nice as it is to 
simply perform well, the most 
notable of Michigan’s successes 
Saturday was its ability to shore 
up problematic areas from past 
games.

The run game continued to 

lead the way with 253 yards and 
three touchdowns, but fifth-year 
senior quarterback Jake Rudock 
looked 
drastically 
improved 

from the previous week. Instead 
of missing open receivers or 

throwing interceptions, Rudock 
found the open man, and he 
made plays with his feet when he 
couldn’t.

Another drastic improvement 

came from senior receiver Amara 
Darboh. Reeling in four catches 
for 54 yards, a touchdown and a 
highlight-reel catch that made 
the No. 3 spot on SportsCenter’s 
Top 10 Plays, Darboh earned the 
game ball just two days after 
becoming a U.S. citizen.

The Bad

If we’re defining bad in the 

modern “cool” way, not as a 
negative, the Wolverines’ defense 
was as bad as it gets. Recording 
their first shutout since blanking 
Illinois 
in 
2012, 
Michigan 

allowed just 105 total yards and 
never let the Cougars into field-
goal range.

The defense was expected 

to wreak havoc all season, but 
was in rare disruptive form 
Saturday. Playing an aggressive 
man coverage in the secondary 
and swarming the backfield on 
nearly every snap, the Wolverines 
completed all of their goals as a 
unit, including the coveted blank 
slate.

“It’s great to be a part of a 

shutout,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “Everybody did a great 

job — players, coaches, everybody. 
When you only give up 105 yards, 
that’s really special.”

After 
surrendering 
just 

14 points in its three-game 
homestand, Michigan now has 
the nation’s fourth-best scoring 
defense at 9.5 points allowed per 
game to go with its second-best 
total defense (205.3 yards per 
game).

The Ugly

As great as Michigan’s defense 

was 
Saturday, 
BYU 
looked 

nothing like the ranked power 
it was expected to be before the 
game. 
Freshman 
quarterback 

Tanner Mangum — a hero with 
two Hail Mary in the three weeks 
that led to Saturday’s game — 
was a mess from start to finish, 
completing just 12 of 28 passes 
for 55 yards.

The Cougars didn’t stop there. 

Bad snaps, fumbles and late-hit 
penalties ensured BYU never 
had a chance at winning, even if 
Michigan hadn’t played so well.

“They 
executed

Five things we learned

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

That was a surprise.
The Michigan football team 

dismantled then-No. 22 Brigham 
Young on Saturday, 31-0, defying 
expectations by shutting out a 
ranked opponent for the first 
time since 2003.

The 
win 
earned 
the 

Wolverines a No. 22 ranking 
in this week’s AP Top 25 poll 
and increased their credibility 
around the country.

After the game, Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh said that 
he feels that his coaching staff 
is starting to know the team. 
As the weeks have passed, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
capabilities 

are becoming more and more 
evident to everyone, not just the 
coaching staff.

Here are five things we 

learned 
from 
Saturday’s 

Michigan victory.

1. Michigan is actually good.

It was one thing when the 

Wolverines posted consecutive 
blowouts against Oregon State 
and UNLV, two unheralded 
opponents 
who 
stood 
little 

chance against Michigan. But 
BYU, on the other hand, entered 
Saturday’s game with a national 
ranking and an offense that had 
consistently 
produced, 
even 

with a backup quarterback.

Few of those strengths were 

evident Saturday. The Cougars 
left Michigan Stadium with 
no points and their second 
straight loss. The Wolverines 
manhandled BYU in all facets of 
the game. Michigan ran for more 
than 200 yards for the third 
consecutive game and held the 
Cougars to just 105 yards of total 
offense.

But the good news didn’t end 

for the Wolverines when the 
clock hit zero. Later Saturday 
night, 
Michigan’s 
season-

opening 
opponent, 
Utah, 

destroyed Oregon, 62-20, in the 
Ducks’ home stadium.

The Wolverines lost to Utah, 

24-17, three weeks ago. At the 
time, it appeared as though 

Michigan struggled immensely 
in the defeat. In hindsight, 
however, it is possible instead 
that the Utes are an elite college 
football team. Their success 
makes the Wolverines’ lone 
defeat look more favorable.

2. Jake Rudock can adjust on 
the fly.

Michigan’s fifth-year senior 

quarterback entered Saturday’s 
game 
having 
faced 
three 

weeks of mostly criticism from 
Wolverine fans. He had matched 
his interception total from last 
season (five) in the season’s first 
three games, and many fans had 
begun to question his decision-
making ability.

Saturday, 
Rudock 
looked 

like a different quarterback. He 
completed his first turnover-free 
game and frequently scrambled 
when 
faced 
with 
pressure 

instead of throwing the ball 
into tight coverage and risking 
turnovers. Rudock finished the 
game 14-for-25 passing with 
195 yards and one touchdown. 
He complemented that with 33 
rushing yards and two rushing 
touchdowns. 

3. 
De’Veon 
Smith 
is 
the 

featured running back.

One week ago, some wondered 

whether junior running back Ty 
Isaac could take over for Smith 
in the lead-back role after he 
rushed for 114 yards against 
UNLV. Smith’s play Saturday 
indicated that will not be the 
case.

He scampered for 125 yards on 

16 carries — averaging 7.81 yards 
per carry. Though that number 
was bolstered by Smith’s 60-yard 
touchdown run that appeared 
in SportsCenter’s Top 10 Plays 
on Saturday, the run itself was 
a sight to behold. Smith refused 
to go down, despite multiple 
attempts by would-be tacklers.

Though Smith did leave the 

game with a right ankle injury, 
he said he will play next Saturday 
with little hesitation. If he does, 
there is little doubt that he will 
receive the bulk of Michigan’s 

carries.

4. Americans play football 
better than anyone else.

Amara Darboh’s first football 

game as an American citizen 
was one to remember. In the first 
quarter, he made a catch that 
also appeared in SportsCenter’s 
Top 10 Plays. He followed it up 
with a touchdown grab early in 
the second quarter, and finished 
the game with four receptions 
for 57 yards.

The win capped a special 

week 
for 
Darboh 
after 
he 

became an American citizen in 
Detroit on Thursday. Though he 
had spent the vast majority of 
his life in America after leaving 
war-torn Sierra Leone as a child, 
the 
naturalization 
ceremony 

made his journey official.

Darboh 
created 
more 

memories Saturday, with a catch 
that will long be preserved on 
highlight reels and a touchdown 
that helped his team earn the 
victory. 
Darboh 
received 
a 

game ball after the game and 
his teammates chanted “USA” 
when he broke the huddle. It will 
be tough to top his first football 
game as an American.

5. 
Michigan’s 
defensive 

players aren’t joking when 
they discuss expectations for 
their unit.

Last Monday, Michigan senior 

linebacker James Ross said that 
he believed the team’s defense 
could be the best in the country, 
that it would be “criminal” if 
he didn’t, considering all of 
the work the team has put in. 
Saturday, Michigan’s defense 
backed up his assertion.

The Wolverines allowed just 

105 total yards, and BYU made 
few traverses into Michigan 
territory. 
The 
Cougars 
did 

not finish any drive past the 
Wolverines’ 43-yard line.

Michigan’s defense is ranked 

No. 2 in the country in yardage 
allowed and No. 4 in the country 
in 
scoring 
defense. 
Ross’ 

comments do not appear to be 
hyperbole.

‘M’ splits weekend games

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

American 
general 
George 

Patton once said, “Success is 
how high you bounce after you 
hit bottom.”

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

volleyball team found out what 
Patton meant this weekend. 
Friday, the Wolverines fell to No. 
20 Purdue, 3-0, and they were 
outblocked, 9-2. On Saturday, 
however, Michigan rebounded 
to defeat Indiana, 3-1.

“We were going to see what 

our team was made of coming off 
a tough loss (Friday night),” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen.

Against 
the 
Boilermakers, 

the first set featured a back-
and-forth that left the score 
tied at 23. But a kill by Purdue’s 
Danielle Cuttino and an attack 
error by Michigan sophomore 
outside hitter Adeja Lambert 
gave Purdue the final leg up in its 
25-23 victory.

“The 
first 
set 
was 
an 

unbelievable 
volleyball 
set,” 

Rosen said. “Both teams were 
just going back and forth. For us 
to side out at 75 percent and lose, 
that’s amazing. It just means the 
game is playing so purely.”

The second set began much 

like the first, as Michigan found 
itself clinging to a 12-10 lead. 
But Purdue proceeded to go on 
a 5-0 run to give itself the upper 
hand once again, which the 
Boilermakers did not relinquish 
in their 25-19 win.

Purdue continued its winning 

ways in the third set when it 
went on a 6-1 run en route to a 
25-18 victory.

Despite the loss, there were 

bright spots for the Wolverines.

Lambert ended the night with 

14 kills, surpassing her previous 
season high of 13. Freshman 
setter Maddy Abbott notched 
two service aces and 18 assists.

“I’ve been working on my 

out-of-systems shot in practice 
and just being an all around 

better player,” Lambert said. 
“Whatever I can do to help my 
team out, that’s my goal.”

Saturday, it was clear that 

Michigan wasn’t the same team 
that had lost the night before.

In the first set against the 

Hoosiers, 
the 
Wolverines 

opened up a 14-8 advantage 
before allowing Indiana three 
unanswered points. Then junior 
middle blocker Abby Cole came 
up with a kill, which stunted 
the Hoosiers’ momentum as 
Michigan triumphed, 25-16.

“The 
first 
set 
was 

outstanding,” Rosen said. “We 
jumped out and blocked really 
well, and blocking is a big focus 
point for us.”

At first, it appeared that the 

Wolverines would continue their 
success with a seven-point lead. 
But Indiana stormed back with 
an 8-0 run. Luckily for Michigan, 

freshman Carly Skjodt stopped 
the bleeding with a kill.

The damage had already been 

done, though, as the set went 
back and forth before a shot by 
Skjodt landed just out of bounds 
to give the Hoosiers a 25-23 win.

“We got complacent,” Rosen 

said. “This team has in no 
way earned the right to be 
complacent, not that any team 
has. We’re not far along (enough) 
in our development for that.”

The heartbreak proved to 

be an aberration, as Michigan 
held Indiana to a -.032 hitting 
percentage in set number three. 
Led by Cole’s five kills, the 
Wolverines topped the Hoosiers 
25-14.

Cole and Michigan continued 

to dominate in the final set, as 
6-0 and 5-1 runs propelled the 
Wolverines to a 25-16 set victory. 
Cole ended the night with 14 

kills and 10 blocks, her second 
double-double this season.

“Our centers did a really good 

job of connecting with the other 
centers and me tonight,” Cole 
said.

In Friday’s match, Michigan 

was outblocked, 9-2, and could 
only 
muster 
a 
.193 
hitting 

percentage. 
In 
Saturday’s 

contest, the Wolverines notched 
13 blocks to the Hoosiers’ eight, 
all while compiling a .336 hitting 
percentage.

The differences between the 

Purdue and Indiana went well 
beyond those seen on a stat sheet. 
Saturday’s victory proved that 
Michigan was resilient enough 
to bounce back from a tough loss.

“One of the adjustments our 

coaches wanted us to make is 
to learn as you go,” Cole said. 
“As long as we’re consistent and 
learning as we go, we’ll be fine.”

Michigan drops 
rivalry matchup 
in East Lansing

The Wolverines 

struggled from the 
outset against MSU 

on Friday

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

It took less than a minute for 

the Michigan women’s soccer 
team 
to 

fall behind 
against 
Michigan 
State on Friday.

Spartans midfielder Michaela 

Kovacs capitalized on a rebound 
inside the 18-yard box to open 
the scoring 46 seconds into the 
game, putting the Wolverines in 
a hole early.

It was a 

quick 
start 

to a long day 
for Michigan 
as it fell to 
Michigan 
State, 
3-0. 
The 

Wolverines 
dropped 
to 

7-4 (2-1 Big 
Ten) on the 
season with the loss.

“Our team was flat the entire 

day,” said Michigan coach Greg 
Ryan. “They won’t make excuses 
for themselves. I won’t make 
excuses for them. They did not 
put in effort representing the 
kind of Michigan we want to 
represent when we step on the 
field, and this is what happens.”

One of the Wolverines’ best 

chances of the game came in 
the sixth minute, when senior 
midfielder Corinne Harris took 
a shot from inside the 18-yard 
box that hit the crossbar.

“We got a little unlucky, 

a couple shots off the post,” 
Harris said. “Overall we were 
just battling, they were battling, 
and they knocked theirs in and 
we didn’t. That’s something we 
are going to keep working on 
this week and for the rest of the 
season.”

While Michigan had won 

three straight over the Spartans 
coming in, the Wolverines were 
never really in Friday’s game. 
They conceded more goals than 
they had in any other game 
so far this season, and did not 
put any real pressure on the 
opposing defense.

Michigan had twice as many 

shots as Michigan State, but 
the Wolverines forced Spartans 
goaltender Gabrielle Gauruder 
to make just two saves.

On the other side of the 

ball, it was the opposite story. 
Michigan State took just seven 
shots but scored three goals. 
If it weren’t for sophomore 
goalkeeper Megan Hinz’s two 
saves, the fixture may have been 
even more lopsided.

Michigan 
had 
some 

opportunities on set pieces, 
drawing 
12 
fouls, 
but 
the 

Wolverines were unable to take 
advantage of any of the dead-
ball situations.

“Every 
single 
year 
we 

play them it’s a huge battle,” 
Harris said. “Michigan State 
is obviously one of our biggest 

rivals, so I think 
both 
teams 

anticipate 
the 

game for a long 
time. 
They 

came 
out 
on 

top today and 
had the better 
chances, 
and 

knocked them 
in, so all credit 
to them.”

One of the 

Spartans’ fouls did turn into 
an opportunity for Michigan in 
the 58th minute, when senior 
defender 
Christina 
Murillo 

hit a free kick on frame. 
But Gauruder was up to the 
challenge, tipping it over the 
crossbar for a Michigan corner.

Junior 
defender 
Anna 

Soccorsi was the only player 
to play every minute for the 
Wolverines, as 10 substitutes 
saw action for Michigan. The 
bench also played a large role 
for Michigan State, as its goals 
in the 61st and 67th minutes 
came from substitutes Kristelle 
Yewah and Erica Goodenough, 
respectively.

“I think they are going to get 

a couple of days’ rest,” Ryan 
said. “This is finally a little bit 
of a break for us. Hopefully they 
will get some energy back and 
hopefully bring some fresh legs, 
fresh minds and fresh hearts to 
the next contest.”

Michigan, which has not won 

on the road this year, will have 
plenty of lessons to learn from 
its contest against Michigan 
State, with games at Maryland 
and No. 2 Rutgers looming next 
week.

Wolverines blank 
Nittany Lions, 2-0

Mellors-Blair, 

Atahuene score as 
Michigan moves to 

2-0 in Big Ten

By AVI SHOLKOFF

For the Daily

When it comes to generating 

scoring chances, the Michigan 
men’s 
soccer 
team 
prefers 
quality 
to 
quantity. 
That 

much was clear Sunday, as the 
Wolverines defeated Penn State 
(1-1-1 Big Ten, 4-2-2, overall), 
2-0, 
despite 
being 
outshot, 

15-6. Michigan claimed sole 
possession of first place in the 
Big Ten with the victory. 

“There 
were 
only 
two 

shots that were dangerous to 
(sophomore goalkeeper Evan 
Louro) and both came in the 
first half,” Daley said. “The 
quality of shots, and quality of 
chances is what we live on.”

The 
Wolverines 
(2-0-0, 

5-2-1) scored the first goal of 
the game in the 35th minute, 
when senior forward William 
Mellors-Blair took a pass from 
redshirt sophomore midfielder 
Michael Kapitula and buried a 
shot in the bottom right corner. 
Kapitula continues to impress 
this season in his first year of 
extended playing time. 

“He’s fully recovered now,” 

Daley said. “He came into the 
season super fit and passionate. 
He’s a great team player.” 

Mellors-Blair continues to 

excel, leading the team in shots 
and scoring his third goal for 
the season — good for second on 
the team. 

But after the opening goal, 

neither team found the net until 
after halftime. 

At the half, Daley urged his 

team to maintain possession 
of the ball and create its own 
offensive tempo. Michigan kept 

its usual 4-3-3 formation despite 
Penn State‘s switch to a 4-4-2. 

“(After) halftime is when you 

want to go for it, in the first 15 
or 20 minutes,” Daley said. “The 
last 30 minutes are always going 
be challenging, especially in a 
1-0 game.”

Louro continued to shine for 

the Wolverines. The sophomore 
had five saves in his third 
clean sheet of the season and 
anchored a defense that faced 
the constant offensive threat of 
Penn State midfielder Connor 
Maloney and forward Dayonn 
Harris. The two combined for 
eight shots, including three on 
goal.

Louro’s 
best 
goalkeeping 

came in the 83rd minute, when 
he came off the line to make a 
save just outside the six-yard 
box. The netminder realized 
that certain saves can mean a 
lot more than simply keeping a 
team from scoring. 

“If I make a save like that or 

a defender blocks a shot, it gives 
the team confidence that we’re 
going to win the game,” Louro 
said. 

The block led to a final 

offensive 
counter 
attack 

for 
Michigan 
that 
allowed 

freshman 
forward 
Francis 

Atuahene to finish off an 
insurance goal. 

Atuahene — the Big Ten 

leader in goals — found the back 
of the net in the 89th minute. 
Atauahene took a break to 
start the second half, but his 
teammates made sure to not let 
up in his absence. 

“We’re a team,” Daley said. 

“It’s not one player that is more 
important than the other. Plenty 
of players do a job in a variety 
of areas. We wanted to look at 
something different when were 
giving (Atuahene) a break.”

With yet another impressive 

performance against a ranked 
opponent, the Wolverines have 
made one thing clear: They may 
not dominate the stat sheet, 
but they will continue to make 
good on the chances they get.

momentum churning. He threw 
Davis off of his body for good. 
It was a move straight out of a 
Marshawn Lynch highlight video.

Smith capped the 60-yard 

touchdown with a little hop 
into the end zone before he was 
mobbed by his teammates.

Davis stared off, shaking his 

head.

“Once I got to the second level, 

I knew for a fact I was not letting 
No. 15 tackle me,” Smith said with 
a smirk.

Davis had been emasculated 

to the point that his name was 
hardly of importance to Smith. He 
was just an obstacle in the way, 
another tackler that he had to get 
rid of. He was not alone.

By the time the first half ended 

and Michigan led, 31-0, it was 
clear that the Wolverines felt the 
same way about Davis’ entire 
team.

BYU entered the game with a 

national ranking and an offense 
that had continued to produce 
even with a backup quarterback. 
The Cougars had not scored fewer 
than 23 points in their first three 
games.

That was not the case Saturday. 

And Michigan was not even 
content with the shutout. After 
all, BYU managed to gain more 
than 100 yards in the game, a 
milestone it surpassed in the 
waning moments of the fourth 
quarter.

“I think the thing that I’m still 

kind of irked about is we wanted 
that 100-yard mark too, that they 
hit at the end,” said Desmond 
Morgan.

The Cougars finished the game 

with 105 total yards of offense. 
They had gained at least 381 yards 
in their first three games. By the 
way Morgan and others reacted to 
the shutout, it was as if Michigan 
had no idea.

Amara Darboh, one of 

America’s newest citizens, didn’t 

seem to think much of what BYU 
could or couldn’t do in the first 
quarter, either. When a Jake 
Rudock pass came his way, one he 
had little chance of catching, he 
jumped into the air.

His body turned in the opposite 

direction of the ball as he reached 
out with his right arm. Still, he 
made the catch. Memes sprouted 
on the Internet that compared the 
play to a play Odell Beckham Jr. 
made for the New York Giants last 
season, the one some consider to 
be the best catch in the history of 
the sport.

It was that kind of day 

Saturday, one where almost 
everything went right. Michigan 
blew out an opponent — this 
time a good one — for the third 
straight weekend. The Wolverines 
appear to have rid themselves of 
any shred of self-doubt that can 
accompany a 5-7 season. There 
is a new standard, one that was 
punctuated Saturday.

The standard is not one based 

off other teams. Michigan’s 

players insist they care only about 
what they are capable of doing 
in any given game and any given 
practice.

It was difficult to envision the 

Wolverines doing much more 
Saturday. After losing nine of 
its last 10 games against ranked 
teams, Michigan won this one 
with authority.

The man at the helm of this 

renaissance, Jim Harbaugh, said 
he planned to take six hours to 
enjoy his team’s latest win. Then 
he will move forward, just like 
Smith did after he threw Davis to 
the ground. Smith said nothing to 
his unworthy adversary after he 
left him sprawled on the grass.

“I wish I would have said 

something,” Smith quipped.

But he didn’t have to. The 

Wolverines’ play did all of the 
talking, and they didn’t care about 
anything else.

Fifth-year senior quarterback Jake Rudock turned in his best performance of the
