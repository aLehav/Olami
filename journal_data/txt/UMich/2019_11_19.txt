In November 2018, Michigan 
voters amended the Michigan 
Constitution 
by 
passing 
Proposal 
2, 
which 
places 
legislative and congressional 
redistricting 
in 
the 
hands 
of a 13 member Independent 
Citizens 
Redistricting 
Commission. Monday night, 
the Ford School of Public Policy 
hosted a panel discussion with 
Jocelyn 
Benson, 
Michigan 
Secretary of State, and other 
experts to discuss this new 
approach to redistricting and 
particularly focused on the role 
of “Communities of Interest” 
within this framework. 
COIs are a new concept for 
Michigan 
redistricting 
and 

are 
described 
in 
Proposal 
2 
as 
communities 
that 
“share cultural or historical 
characteristics 
or 
economic 
interests, and do not include 
relationships 
with 
political 
parties, 
incumbents, 
or 
political candidates.” They are 
high on the list of priorities in 
drawing new districts, after 
equal population, compliance 
with the Voting Rights Act and 
contiguity. 
The panel was moderated 
by Nancy Wang, executive 
director 
of 
Voters 
Not 
Politicians, a ballot initiative 
to 
end 
gerrymandering 
in 
Michigan. 
She 
began 
by 
touching on the motivations 
of Constitutional Amendment 
Proposal 2. 
“2018 was a historic election 

for lots of reasons,” Wang said. 
“One big one was two and a 
half million citizens across 
the state of Michigan from all 
political parties, all across the 
state, voted in favor of Proposal 
2, to take politicians out of our 
redistricting process. To make 
Michigan’s days as one of the 
most gerrymandered in the 
entire country, no more. And to 
put in its place a new, citizen-
led process.”
Benson then delivered her 
opening remarks. She thanked 
the other panelists for their 
expertise and emphasized that 
she viewed her office from the 
point of view of an academic 
rather than a politician.
“I know as an academic 
the best way to approach 
something is to collect data 

and make informed decisions 
based on that,” Benson said. 
Benson further explained 
how important it is that the 
commission be independent, 
citizen-led and non-partisan in 
actuality.
“This is not the time to 
take a victory lap,” Benson 
said. “This is the time to dig 
in and continue and really get 
to work in ensuring that this 
commission, that millions of 
citizens envisioned and made 
a reality, is a success. And we 
define success in our office 
as ensuring the process itself 
is truly citizen-led, is truly 
independent and non-partisan 
and is transparent every step 
of the way.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The Students for Choice 
organization 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
hosted 
a 
panel 
on 
reproductive justice for a 
group of about 35 students 
on Monday night at the Ford 
School of Public Policy. 
Emily Peterson, lawyer 
and professor of sociology 
and 
women’s 
studies, 
began the discussion by 
explaining the origins of 
the 
term 
“reproductive 
justice.”
“We all, regardless of 

what 
our 
geopolitical 
boundaries are, have innate 
human rights,” Peterson 
said. “So they took that idea 
from the Human Rights 
Declaration from the UN 
and kind of encapsulated 
some of those concepts into 
a 
(reproductive 
justice) 
framework. 
But 
it 
was 
really founded by women of 
color, screaming you really 
need to be inclusive.”
Community 
member 
Cassy 
Jones-McBryde, 
the first Black organizing 
program coordinator for 
Planned 
Parenthood, 
elaborated on the impact 

of 
Black 
people 
on 
reproductive justice.
“Faye 
Wattleton 
was 
the first Black President 
of Planned Parenthood,” 
Jones-McBryde 
said. 
“She, back in the early 
‘90s… helped center the 
discussion around Black 
people having access to 
reproductive support.”
After 
discussing 
its 
history, Peterson went on to 
define reproductive justice 
as having to do with more 
than 
just 
reproductive 
health.
“You 
need 
to 
acknowledge that as many 

people that tried not to 
reproduce, 
some 
were 
supposed to reproduce,” 
Peterson 
said. 
“Some 
have not had any control 
at all ever… it’s a very 
inclusive phrase for all 
types of recognition of 
bodily autonomy around 
reproduction.”
Kate O’Connor, fourth-
year graduate student of 
American 
Culture, 
said 
introducing 
universal 
health care to all will help 
alleviate fears of expenses 
that sway women away 
from reproducing.

Fraternity banner involving convicted 
felon draws backlash on social media

LSA junior Paige Dotson, a 
child of a U.S. Navy veteran, 
was only able to afford college 
because she was eligible for 
benefits under the Post-9/11 
GI Bill as the dependent of a 
veteran. But two years ago, her 
benefits 
were 
unexpectedly 
revoked, leaving her $20,000 
in debt, the Chicago Sun-Times 
originally reported on Nov. 8th.
Paige’s 
father, 
Russell 
Dotson, served in the U.S. Navy 
for 22 years, both reserve and 
active duty, and was deployed 
to war zones six times. When 
he initially enlisted, he gave 
the 
military 
a 
deduction 
from his salary towards the 
Montgomery GI bill, which 
covered a college bachelor’s 
degree. The transition to a 
Post-9/11 GI bill was signed into 
law in 2008 with an extended 
applicability to pay for graduate 
degrees or trade school and be 
transferable to dependants. 
According to Russell, this 
was a critical change for many 
officers. 
However, 
for 
him 
and others who had served in 
the long-term, Dotson had to 
re-enlist for another four years 
to qualify. He did so with the 
intent to transfer these benefits 
equally between his son and 
Paige. 
“It seems a little wrongheaded 

to go to somebody who has 
already served 16, 18 years, and 
say ‘hey, we’re changing this 
GI bill you already paid for, the 
one that you gave us $1,200 for, 
to this new GI bill,” he said. 
“However, I know that you’ve 
served 16, 15, 10 years, we’re 
going to make you serve four 
more, and then you’ll be able to 
transfer it to your kids.”
Paige enrolled at DePaul 
University in 2017 after her 
father 
finished 
the 
four-
year commitment, excited to 
explore life past her hometown 
of Birch Run, Michigan. She 
immediately used the GI Bill 
to enroll in the school and 
subsidize the high living cost 
in Chicago. When she didn’t 
receive 
her 
living 
stipend 
in the second quarter of her 
freshman year, she called the 
Veteran Affairs National Office 
and was told she was no longer 
eligible to receive benefits and 
would have to repay $20,000 
to the government, including 
interest. She received student 
support services to enroll in the 
next quarter of her freshman 
year but took out extra loans to 
continue her sophomore year. 
“On the military end, they 
said we gave you all this 
money, you’re no longer eligible 
retroactively so you owe all that 
money back,” Paige said.

On 
football 
game 
days at the University 
of Michigan, bed sheets 
hanging on the fronts of 
fraternity houses, spray 
painted with jokes about 
the 
visiting 
football 
team, are common. But 
last 
Saturday 
during 
the 
Michigan-Michigan 
State matchup, the Psi 
Upsilon fraternity at the 
University 
displayed 
one that many students 
deemed insensitive.
The sign read, “You can’t 
touch us @LarryNassar,” 
referencing 
the 
former 
MSU physician and USA 
national 
gymnastics 
team 
doctor 
convicted 
of 
sexually 
assaulting 
over 250 young women 
between 1992 and 2016.
Neither Psi Upsilson’s 
national headquarters nor 
the chapter’s leadership 
responded to The Daily’s 
request for comment by 
the time of publication. 
Saturday 
afternoon, 
Central 
Michigan 

University senior Kirsten 
Lovely posted a tweet 
which included a picture 
of the banner. At the time 
of publication, the tweet 
had 
875 
retweets 
and 
more than 5,200 likes.
Though 
Lovely 
does 
not attend either school, 
she wrote the “fans can 
poke fun at each other, 
but not at the expense of 
hundreds of survivors.” 
In an interview with 
The Daily, Lovely said 
she was not in Ann Arbor 
on the day of the game 
but saw a picture of the 
banner on an Instagram 
story. Lovely is involved in 
a group at CMU that runs 
a survivor crisis hotline 
and has had training on 
sexual 
aggression 
and 
survivor issues. She said 
she was familiar with the 
Nassar case and decided 
to post about the banner 
on 
Twitter 
because 
it 
bothered her.
“I feel like there’s a 
lot of heat that goes into 
the (Michigan-Michigan 
State) game,” Lovely said. 
“We can make fun of each 
other and have banter 


State Rep. Yousef Rabhi and 
state Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 
Arbor, discussed the implications 
of 
solar 
energy 
generation 
Monday at a town hall meeting. 
More 
than 
50 
community 
members gathered to provide 
input 
on 
recent 
legislation 
regarding solar energy usage.
Irwin began the event by 
explaining the background of 
clean energy and defining the 
concept of “net metering.”
“What (net metering) basically 
meant is that if you wanted to 
generate energy at home for a 
solar panel or something else and 
you plug this energy back into 
the grid, the utilities would net 
the energy use,” Irwin said. “If 
you were generating more energy 
than they were using, they would 
bank it. If you were using more 
than you were generating, you’d 

withdraw from that bank… and 
pay them for the excess.” 
The issue at hand is that major 
utility companies such as DTE 
are pushing for the shut-down of 
net metering, Irwin said.
Irwin 
elaborated 
on 
the 
inability of individuals to adopt 
solar energy due to the desires 
of 
utility 
companies. 
After 
utility companies pushed for 
the elimination of net metering, 
the 
legislature 
ruled 
that 
the Michigan Public Service 
Commission would enforce an 
“inflow, outflow” policy. In other 
words, if one were to draw energy 
from the grid, they would pay full 
retail costs.
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
by 
contributing excess energy to 
the grid, one would be paying 
back approximately half the 
amount of full retail. By this 
policy, the utility companies have 
slowed the development and 
deployment of solar in Michigan. 

They have also made the payback 
of a solar energy investment 
more unpredictable, leading to 
uncertainty about investing, and 
have decreased the price paid for 
excess power. 
“The long-term goal is to 
unshackle the Michigan residents 
from fossil fuels,” Irwin said. “It’s 
pretty absurd that we continue to 
rely upon fuels that we import to 
meet our energy needs. It would 
be much more environmentally 
wise and in the long-term much 
more economically wise if we 
were to develop and invest in 
home-grown clean renewable 
sources.” 
In addressing these problems, 
Rabhi discussed the Energy 
Freedom Package and Powering 
Michigan 
Forward 
Package 
— two sets of bills to tackle 
resistance to solar energy use 
in the community. Through the 
Energy Freedom Package, more 
conservative-minded libertarians 
may be drawn to the idea 
of personal choice and 
freedom 
of 
generating 
power, Rabhi said. 
In 
the 
Powering 
Michigan Package, there 
are 
three 
bills. 
House 
Bill 5143 discusses the 
importance of fair-value 
pricing 
by 
requiring 
the MPSC to establish a 
tariff that analyzes the 
distribution of solar energy 
and compensates users on 
the net amount of energy 
that they use. House Bill 
5144 eliminates the inflow/
outflow calculation in order 
to make paybacks for solar 
investment 
much 
more 
predictable. Finally, House 
Bill 5145 eliminates the 
current 1 percent cap on 
the number of individuals 
allowed to generate and 
contribute clean energy. 
Craig Afreekans Jr., a 
fellow for the organization 
“Friends of the Earth” 
is 
studying 
community 
mapping to discover who 
is contributing to a cleaner 

future. Afreekans Jr. said the 
bill eliminating the 1 percent 
cap extends benefits to more 
low 
income 
individuals 
and 
individuals of color.
“I think that in terms of the 
bills that I really like, I really like 
the House Bill 5145, the one that 
eliminates the 1 percent cap,” 
Afreekans Jr. said. “Because 
if only 1 percent of people are 
benefitting from the net metering 
cap that utilities companies have 
out, it’s not really for the state. It’s 
just for a few select people…and 
that doesn’t really mean people 
of color or people of low income.”
After the lecture portion of 
the event wrapped up, Rabhi and 
Irwin answered questions about 
the need for emergency off-grid 
energy sources in major buildings, 
the importance of wind power in 
states like Michigan and the cost 
of energy for electric vehicles. 
Jay Nugen, a do-it-yourself 
hobbyist who has a passion for 
adopting solar energy sources in 
his house, posed a question about 
how DTE would benefit if the 
entire state of Michigan were to 
adopt solar energy.
Irwin said DTE would have 
the opportunity to fill the need 
for power grid backups.
“I think there is a need for the 
grid to be managed and there 
will probably also be a need for 
power to be backed up and I think 
they have an opportunity to fill 
that need,” Irwin said. “They 
could be the ones who lead this 
transition and I think there could 
be a tremendous amount for their 
shareholders to benefit if they 
were to lead this transition for 
us.”
In an interview with The Daily 
after the event Rabhi and Irwin 
noted their short-term and long-
term goals in making sure that 
the utility companies realize that 
more people must start adopting 
solar power.
“I think it’s two-fold — one is 
reclaiming power for the people 
and (the second) is ensuring that 
we have a clean and sustainable 
energy future,” Rabhi said.

NEETI BHUTADA 
For The Daily 


 “On the front end, DePaul 
was like, you can’t register 
for classes, you don’t have the 
funding.”
Russell 
technically 
owed 
an additional 89 days to his 
official service time in order 
to receive the benefits. Since 
he was a reservist, serving one 
weekend per month, this meant 
only 
needing 
6 
additional 
days of weekend service. The 
Board for Correction of Naval 
Records officials could change 
his retirement date in their 
records to make him eligible 
again or waive his retirement 
to allow him to complete the 
six days of service. However, 
they reviewed and rejected his 
request, which Rusell said was 
an arbitrary decision. 
So, Paige transferred to 
the University of Michigan, 
where 
she 
had 
received 
scholarships and could benefit 
from a lower cost of living. 
She said she is still harassed 
by private agencies, to whom 
the government sold portions 
of the debt, and carries the 
emotional weight of her past. 
“My family really struggled, 
and my dad, he got deployed 
again, and again, and again,” 
she said. “And then it was like 
now, the opportunity to go to 
college after the emotional and 
financial sacrifices, and then 
that’s taken away, and now 
I owe money back when I’m 
just trying to do my best. I’m 
just trying to get an education; 
I’m just trying to be a first-
generation college student at 
the University of Michigan. 
All I did was show up to class.”
With a lack of success in 
contacting 
various 
Navy 
bureaus, Paige and her father 
have both contacted several 
representatives 
to 
find 

support, 
which, 
according 
to the two, have been most 
effective after the Chicago 
Sun-Times 
article. 
Paige 
said a highlight was when 
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, 
retweeted her story, a traction 
which has motivated her to 
reach out further to local 
representatives. 
“Ultimately, 
moving 
forward, I’m going to be 
leveraging my coverage to 
try to gain congressional and 
senatorial support to try to 
drive change,” she said. “And 
hopefully along the way, I have 
a GoFundMe page set up to try 
to have resources for myself 
and other families, as much 
as I can contribute to them, 
so that in the event that this 
doesn’t change, it’s just not 
done.” 
Paige has also started a 
GoFundMe page for other 
children of veterans who have 
had their GI bill rescinded and 
for herself finding debt-relief 
grants.
“I 
feel 
very 
privileged 
that I was on the face of this 
issue, it feels like there’s 
a 
lot 
of 
responsibility 
to 
move it forward, and that’s 
absolutely what I plan to do,” 
Paige Dotson said. “Knowing 
that there are other families 
experiencing 
it, 
now 
it’s 
almost like a fight for me. This 
is something that I absolutely 
have to more forward with.” 
Engineering 
senior 
John 
Iacovetta is the vice president 
of 
Student 
Veterans 
of 
America’s University chapter, 
and has been following the 
story closely. Iacovetta was 
himself in the Navy for 10 
years and is waiting to use his 
GI bill for graduate school. 
“My opinion is that this is 
an admin issue, and that it’s 
a 
career 
counseling 
issue. 
Every navy unit is supposed 
to have a career counsellor 

and they’re supposed to help 
guide you through your navy 
career, and help you with 
advancement, retention and 
then general opportunities to 
really enhance your career,” 
Iacovetta said. 
Iacovetta said he believes 
this is an issue of the Navy’s 
administration 
and 
career 
counseling office whose job is 
to aid with advancement in the 
industry.
“Additionally, 
they’re 
supposed to help you with your 
transition out of the military, 
and the other thing that they 
help you with is transitioning 
over your benefits to your 
dependents. My experience 
with 
career 
counsellors 
has been that they are not 
knowledgeable about this last 
subset, being transitioning out 
of the military or transferring 
your benefits.”
Iacovetta worked as a career 
counselor himself for a year 
as a reservist, and said the job 
was difficult, largely because 
of the overly bureaucratic 
system. 
“It was hell because people 
ask you all these questions 
about, 
literally 
these 
are 
questions that are affecting 
the rest of their lives, and more 
often than not I did not know 
what the answers were,” he 
said. “But one thing about me 
is that I have no problem just 
telling people I don’t know the 
answer, right, and we’re going 
to go off to find the answer 
from somebody who does, but 
I think there are plenty of 
people who do not prescribe to 
that mindset, and are willing 
to just rattle off whatever 
answer gets them through the 
day.” 
Russell, 
however, 
emphasized there are many 
entities involved, and reflected 
on how he could have verified 
the dates early on to avoid the 

mistake. 
“I’m not going to sit here 
and put every bit of blame for 
this on the military. One of 
the military standard answers 
is what the military does like 
to say is your career, your 
responsibility,” he said. “I 
would tell somebody to trust 
but verify if somebody is telling 
them that they’ve completed 
an obligation, or that they’ve 
met all the requirements. I 
would recommend that they 
go talk to somebody else as 
well, just for a second opinion 
before they’ve made any life 
changes based on that.”
Despite partial admission 
of this mistake on his end, 
Russell still has his GI bill, but 
has no plans to use the money 
himself. His family is still 
holding out to hopefully fix 
the mistake. Until then, they 
continue to reach out for help. 
“One of the things I’ve been 
pointing out is my GI bill is 
not gone, it’s still sitting right 
where it always was,” Russell 
said. “I could go use this GI bill 
for myself today if I wanted to. 
I’m not asking for money. The 
money is already sitting there. 
I’m simply asking to be able 
to transfer the money to my 
children.” 
Meanwhile, 
Paige 
has 
utilized 
the 
resources 
at 
the University to finish her 
degree, thankful especially for 
the support from faculty. 
“Equally 
among 
both 
schools, the faculty have been 
probably 
the 
most 
crucial 
piece of my success,” she said. 
“I do think the resources 
provided on campus, either 
through CAPS, or UHS, are so 
important, using those tools 
have helped me learn how to 
kind of deal with it on more a 
survival-based level. How do 
you just get through the now, 
and then we’ll worry about 
that stuff in a minute.”

back and forth, but not 
making fun of it in a way 
that includes a national 
tragedy and that heavily 
impacted survivors.”
Lovely said she was not 
expecting the tweet to get 
the reaction that it did, 
but said she hopes it will 
start a conversation about 
how survivors should be 
treated.
“I think it would be 
great if there was some 
education on the history 
of the case and what the 
survivors went through,” 
Lovely 
said. 
“I 
know 
there were victim impact 
statements that were bad 
at the trial, that would 
be a really great place to 
start.”
Lovely 
was 
not 
the 
only person responding 
negatively to the banner 
online. Replies to Lovely’s 
original tweet called the 
banner “disgusting” and 
“classless.”
Olympic 
gymnast 
Simone Biles retweeted 
the tweet, writing she 
hopes 
the 
University 
takes proper measures in 
investigating the banner.
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesperson 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
said 
Fraternity and Sorority 
Life 
staff 
contacted 
the 
chapter 
president 
and 
advisors 
of 
the 
University’s Psi Upsilon 
chapter. 
Complaints 
against the chapter have 
been submitted by campus 
community 
members 
to the Greek Activities 
Review Panel, according 
to Broekhuizen. She said 
the matter was addressed 

swiftly and appropriately 
by the fraternity involved 
and its national office.
“FSL 
has 
learned 
that the chapter will be 
pursuing corrective action 
for 
those 
responsible 
for hanging the banners 
and those who failed to 
intervene before anyone 
could 
be 
negatively 
impacted,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote.
Additionally, 

Broekhuizen 
wrote 

that 
FSL 
supports 
students 
in 
their 
four 
councils 
to 
live 
more 
fully into the principles 
of 
their 
international 
organizations, 
campus 
core values and the FSL 
Statement 
for 
Human 
Dignity. 
LSA 
junior 
Mary 
McKillop, 
LSA 
Student 

Government 
vice 

president, 
first 
became 
aware of the banner after 
seeing 
Lovely’s 
tweet. 
She said she thought the 
banner was unnecessary 
and hurtful to see.
“I 
think 
it’s 
really 
disappointing 
and 
sad 
that the survivors of that 
situation 
were 
turned 
into 
a 
joke 
for 
some 
stupid football rivalry,” 
McKillop 
said. 
“School 
rivalries are supposed to 
be fun, and that just really 
went somewhere it didn’t 
need to go.”
McKillop said she thinks 
Psi Upsilon should release 
a public apology and be 
punished for hanging up 
the banner. 
“A lot of people I know 
are personally upset by 
(the banner),” McKillop 
said. “I can only imagine 
what being involved in 
that situation and seeing 
that would feel like.”

She 
said 
they 
plan 
on 
implementing the application 
process 
in 
several 
phases. 
The first phase, which they 
are currently in, is inviting 
Michigan 
residents 
to 
randomly serve on the 13 
member 
commission. 
The 
second phase begins in June, 
when 
applications 
close. 
200 
semi-finalists 
will 
be 
randomly 
selected 
using 
geographic and demographic 
data, 
ensuring 
four 
Republicans, four Democrats 
and five unaffiliated voters 
are selected. Phase three will 
begin in fall 2020 when the 
committee is seated and will 
end in the fall of 2021 when the 
redistricting is complete. 
“The 
commission, 
once 
seated, will have one year from 

next fall to draw the maps that 
will be the next congressional, 
state 
legislative 
and 
state 
senate districts for the entire 
state,” Benson said.
Wang then began the panel 
discussion with a question 
for panelist Chris Lamar, the 
legal counsel for redistricting 
with 
the 
Campaign 
Legal 
Center in Washington, D.C.. 
Lamar mentioned the relative 
commonality of the COI and 
the importance of its use in 
this context. 
“The idea of COIs, while it 
sounds nebulous, is actually 
not a rare thing,” Lamar said. 
“Twenty four states consider 
COIs in various aspects. COIs 
generally include racial, social, 
economic 
considerations… 
COIs 
do 
not 
include 
relationships 
to 
political 
parties or to incumbents. And 
that’s very important to me.”
Wang’s next question was for 
panelist Connie Malloy, chair 

of the 2010 California Citizens 
Redistricting 
Commission. 
Wang 
asked 
Malloy 
about 
her experience as a part of 
California’s 
commission. 
Malloy 
emphasized 
the 
crucial 
role 
commission 
members play in offering more 
humanized information about 
a community. 
“There’s 
so 
much 
the 
census 
does 
not 
tell 
you 
about a community,” Malloy 
said. “It doesn’t give you 
any information about the 
economy, the geography, or 
the history of a place. And 
that is something where the 
testimony 
from 
the 
public 
and your lived experience is 
really critical to be able to 
inform how the commission 
takes these dry numbers and 
statistics from the census and 
makes it come alive into a set of 
fair maps that make sense for 
the community.”
Panelist 
Christopher 

Thomas, 
former 
director 
of elections for the State of 
Michigan, then weighed in 
by comparing the old Apol 
Standards of redistricting to 
the new standards set in 2018. 
“So (the Apol standards) 
looked at jurisdictional lines,” 
Thomas said. “So after you 
did the federal population 
and Voting Rights Act, and 
contiguity, 
you 
then 
drew 
a plan that split the fewest 
number of county lines, and 
that within those counties, 
split the fewest number of city 
and township lines. It sounded 
really neutral. There’s some 
consideration that it really 
didn’t turn out that neutral.”
Wang then asked Malloy 
to explain in more detail the 
concept of drawing boundaries 
that align with community 
lines. 
Malloy 
explained 
that the California Citizens 
Redistricting 
Commission 
gave equal priority to city, 

county and COI lines, but that 
this often came with trade-offs 
between them. 
“Given 
how 
rarely 
jurisdictional 
boundaries 
change,” Malloy said. “There’s 
times 
where 
they 
don’t 
actually reflect the fabric of 
the community that has grown 
out organically around them.”
Malloy further explained 
the process through which the 
California Commission took 
public opinion into account. 
“We had a set of (public) 
hearings,” she said. “(And we 
had) live visualizations that 
were 
always 
live-streamed 
or people could weigh in as 
we were actually in the map-
making process.”
Wang 
asked 
Benson 
to 
elaborate on the Michigan 
Commission’s 
actual 
process of redistricting. She 
emphasized 
the 
autonomy 
of 
the 
commission 
within 
Constitutional 
bounds 
and 

the 
importance 
of 
citizen 
participation. 
“The commission will be 
autonomous. Our office will 
be focused on the citizen 
engagement component of this 
effort,” Benson said. “I think, 
at every point, it will be the 
voices of citizens who lead the 
way.”
Information 
graduate 
student Bonnie White believes 
this is a positive initiative. 
“Prior to being a student 
I 
wasn’t 
aware 
(of) 
the 
extent 
that 
Michigan 
was 
gerrymandered,” White said. 
“I think it’s a testament to the 
citizens of Michigan, that it’s 
voters and politicians, that 
the program has been so well-
received, 
and 
implemented. 
It’s 
just 
really 
impressive. 
The impact that they’ve had 
state-wide. And I think it’s 
wonderful that citizens are 
being able to participate in 
democracy in this way.”

This is the idea that

Senate Assembly talks new 
sexual misconduct policy

Faculty meet to vote on issue, but do not have quorum

The University of Michigan 
Faculty 
Senate 
Assembly 
met Monday to discuss and 
vote to implement the new 
umbrella sexual misconduct 
policy. 
However, 
because 
they didn’t have a quorum, 
they were unable to vote on 
any of the issues. Instead, 
the 
Senate 
Assembly 
and 
Faculty attending the meeting 
discussed questions regarding 
the policy.
In response to a third-
party review of past sexual 
misconduct 
procedures, 
the new policy would apply 
to the Dearborn, Flint and 
Ann Arbor campuses of the 
University. 
Sascha 
Matish, 
associate vice provost and 
senior director of Academic 
Human Resources, mentioned 
the new document is very 
similar to existing policies 
regarding sexual misconduct 
at the University. 
“They largely codify what 
we already have in place,” 
Matish 
said. 
“It’s 
putting 
basically our policies and 
procedures that existed in 

a large number of places 
into one policy into the two 
procedures, 
the 
employee 
procedures, as well as the 
student procedures.”
The new policy redefines 
prohibited 
conduct, 
which 
now includes sexual assault, 
sexual exploitation, sexual 
harassment, 
gender-based 
harassment, 
sexual 
and/
or 
gender-based 
stalking, 
intimate 
partner 
violence, 
sex 
and 
gender-based 
discrimination, 
retaliation 
and violation of protective 
measures. 
Several faculty members 
asked questions regarding the 
differences, 
inconsistencies 
and overlap between faculty 
and employees within the 
policy. A few staff comments 
targeted 
how 
this 
new 
umbrella is a consolidation 
of 
existing 
policies. 
LSA 
professor Marjorie Levinson 
focused on how the new 
umbrella policy could be an 
opportunity to innovate and 
create more fair practices. 
“Why did you undertake so 
modest of a task as to simply 
codify the existing practice 
 

when we’re all aware of the 
need 
for 
implementing 
a 
much more sensitive and fair-
minded practices is widely 
felt?” Levinson asked.
In an attempt to comply 
with a ruling from the Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals that 
requires students on both 
sides of a sexual misconduct 
policy to cross-examine each 
other while still protecting 
students 
from 
emotional 
hardship, 
Prof. 
Barry 
Belmont, the chairperson of 
the Committee on Civil Rights 
and 
Liberties, 
proposed 
a resolution to have third 
parties speak for students 
during cross-examination. 
“(We’d like) to have cross-
examination but not to have 
it by a respondent directly 
questioning a complainant,” 
Belmont said. “But by having 
an advisor acting on either 
behalf or some representative 
hearing officer to serve in 
that cross-examination.”
The Senate Assembly voted 
in favor of the resolution, but 
because they didn’t have a 
quorum the vote was invalid.

For The Daily 

“One of the things about 
being pregnant or trying 
to 
become 
pregnant 
is 
infertility services are hard 
cover,” O’Connor said. “You 
can lose your job because 
you’re pregnant. Not legally, 
but if you are late two or 
three times in the morning 
because you are throwing 
up, then you can lose your 
job, which means you lose 
your health insurance if you 
have it through your job. 
If we move to a system of 
universal health insurance, 
some of those fears go 
away.” 
Peterson 
identified 
issues 
with 
some 
high 
schools’ 
sex 
education 
programs that don’t offer 
a sexual education course 
that 
incorporates 
sex 
and not just abstinence. 
Peterson 
finds 
this 
most 
detrimental 
for 
communities with a lack of 
access to other educational 
resources due to economic 
framework 
or 
systemic 
racial oppression.
“One of the things that 
I think is really pressing 
is 
quite 
frankly, 
sex 
education 
and 
consent,” 
Peterson said. “Based on 
sex, I think that you need to 
start at the very beginning 

of training people how 
to have healthy or sexual 
conversations 
before 
we 
even start the reproducing 
part. So things as simple 
as a push for abstinence-
only education will have a 
snowball effect.”

Jones-McBryde 
mentioned some ways she 
is trying to help foster 

reproductive 
justice 
at 
Planned 
Parenthood 
for 
Black women.
“I was able to have our 
first training for our health 
center 
staff 
about 
the 
African Diaspora, what it 
actually is and talk about 
how there is implicit bias 
in the way that we treat 
our 
patients 
sometimes, 
and how to dismantle that,” 
Jones-McBryde said. 
Emily 
Statham, 
first-
year 
Law 
student, 
said 
the University can help 
foster reproductive justice 
and 
inclusiveness 
by 
emphasizing the margin-
to-center movement. 
“I really liked one of 
the ideas mentioned about 
focusing on the margin-to-
center movement,” Statham 
said. “So, this is the idea 
that reproductive justice as 
a movement was born out of 
the strife of Black women, 
and bringing people into the 
center of this conversation 
who currently exist on the 
margins. Whether, that be 
people who are LGBTQIA+ 
identifying, people who are 
racial and ethnic minorities, 
making 
sure 
that 
their 
own 
struggles 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
reproductive 
justice are informing the 
conversation, not reacting 
to the conversation, is I 
think the most important 
thing moving forward.”

College students should escape the vape
I

magine, for a second, that 
your health is your grade 
point average. Right now, 
regardless of how high or low 
your GPA is, it does not have an 
impact on your ability to meet 
your day-to-day needs. Your GPA 
doesn’t prohibit you from eating, 
sleeping or finding a decent part-
time job. However, perhaps your 
first “Welcome Week” turned into 
a “Welcome Semester” and you 
ditched the library for tailgates. 
Whether it’s interviewing for 
your dream job or applying to 
graduate school later down the 
road, you are likely to face some 
regret and pain for the decisions 
you made when you were younger 
and less experienced. The same 
can be said about your health. 
Like your freshman year GPA, 
when it comes to your body’s 
health, there are no do-overs. 
Just as partying, skipping class 
and failing exams can take their 
toll on your GPA, habits such as 
vaping can come at a price. 
Vaping in recent years has 
grown in popularity and evolved 
into its own culture. The practice 
is no longer confined to smoking 
cessation; students taking a hit 
between classes or at the library 
are no longer an uncommon sight. 
As one VICE article explained, 
“vaping 
can 
mean 
different 
things to different people.” In 
essence, vaping is the inhalation 
of 
vaporized 
e-liquid 
using 
e-cigarettes, including JUULs 
and similar devices. E-liquid 
is either propylene glycol or 
vegetable glycerin mixed with 
nicotine or marijuana (THC or 
CBD) and can contain artificial 
flavoring. 
Vaping’s 
increasing 
popularity is not unique to the 
University of Michigan’s campus. 
The 
University’s 
national 
“Monitoring the Future” study 
found the percent of college 
students vaping marijuana and/
or nicotine doubled between 2017 
and 2018.
Unfortunately, we are just 
beginning to witness the impact 
that this cultural phenomenon is 
having on our short-term health. 
As of Sept. 2019, six people 
have died from lung illnesses 
related to vaping nicotine or 
THC. According to the same 
VICE article, about 450 cases 
of vaping-associated illness are 
suspected in hospitals across the 
United States. MeiLan K. Han, 
professor of internal medicine 
in the Division of Pulmonary 
and 
Critical 
Care 
Medicine 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
told 
VICE that “at this time there 
is no guaranteed ‘safe’ form 
of vaping,” because the cases 
have been linked to e-liquid 
containing 
marijuana 
and 
nicotine. Perhaps this growing 
epidemic can be traced to lack 
of regulation. As the VICE 
article states, currently there is 
no regulation or inspection of 
e-cigarette 
manufacturers 
or 
vape shops, so there is no way to 

tell if a device or liquid is from 
a reputable source. Without 
regulation from the U.S. Food 
and 
Drug 
Administration, 
e-liquid manufacturers have free 
rein to mislabel the contents of 
their product and do not have 
to meet a single standard during 
the manufacturing process. 
Furthermore, the long-term 
health costs of vaping are just 
as steep as the short-term 
consequences. 
According 
to 
VICE, some studies have found 
vaping CBD can cause some 
users to experience irritability, 
lethargy, reduced appetite or 
urination, 
gastrointestinal 
distress, rashes, breathing issues, 
or in the worst instances, liver 
problems or exacerbations of 
mental health issues. Proponents 
of vaping often argue it’s a better 
alternative to smoking cigarettes 
and has enabled them to find a 
sense of community. However, 
a recent Stanford University 
investigation of flavored e-liquids 
found that even without nicotine 
e-cigarette use, flavorings may 
increase one’s heart disease 
risk. As important as it is to find 
a support group, it shouldn’t 
have to come at the expense of 
your health. While we should 
acknowledge that e-cigarette 
use has helped smokers reduce 
or eliminate their addiction, 
we can’t ignore the fact that 
vaping is also inspiring the next 
generation to become addicted to 
nicotine. 

When it comes to preventing 
the practice of vaping in the 
first place, the work of state 
governments 
is 
worrisome 
at best. As long as our state 
governments 
continue 
to 
generate revenue from tobacco 
product sales, the idea of states 
running and funding tobacco 
prevention programs seem to be 
a complete conflict of interest. 
During the 2019 fiscal year, all 
50 states will collect over 27 
billion dollars in total revenue 
from tobacco settlements and 
tobacco taxes. However, only 2.4 
percent of this revenue will go 
towards tobacco prevention and 
cessation programs. Michigan’s 
tobacco 
prevention 
program 
funding currently ranks 45th out 
of all 50 states with a budget that 
is only 1.5 percent of the funding 
levels 
recommended 
by 
the 
CDC. The reality is that tobacco 
products are a significant source 
of revenue for the state; from 

a fiscal standpoint, why would 
the state fully fund prevention 
programs 
that 
jeopardize 
a 
revenue source? Placing the 
responsibility of preventing drug 
use in the hands of the same 
institution that is profiting from 
it doesn’t make sense. 
Luckily for college students 
at the University and across 
the country, there are ample 
resources available on campus 
to help students with substance 
abuse. Programs are in place 
within the University Health 
System to break down financial 
and immigration status barriers 
that might impede access to 
these resources for students. 
However, this is only accessible 
if students are willing to ask for 
help. Nevertheless, the resources 
available on campus represent a 
reactive solution to this growing 
epidemic. Students often do not 
access these resources until after 
vaping has become a substantial 
problem. As vaping continues 
to grow in popularity, resisting 
peer pressure to start vaping 
regularly will only prove more 
difficult. 
Consequently, 
high 
school students on their way to 
college do not fully grasp these 
consequences of vaping. If we 
want to make sure students are 
making an educated choice to 
vape and discourage students 
from starting in the first place, 
we need a proactive solution. 
As 
college 
students, 
our 
firsthand experience navigating 
the stressors and social pressure 
of college life makes us uniquely 
qualified to educate students 
on how to avoid or reduce 
consumption 
of 
e-liquids. 
College students should take 
the lead on educating the next 
generation on the consequences 
of vaping. As the leaders and the 
best, we have a responsibility 
to educate the next generation 
of college students about the 
reality of substance use and 
consequences on campus.
In life, rarely do we ever 
purchase 
something 
without 
knowing its price. By failing to 
properly educate youth on vaping 
and its potential health risks, we 
are allowing young vapers to 
blindly jeopardize their health, 
both long term and short term. 
Just like your freshman year 
GPA, your body’s health doesn’t 
get a “do-over.” As a student 
body, we have a responsibility to 
take advantage of the resources 
available to curb vaping for those 
who do not believe it’s worth 
the expense to one’s health. 
We also have a responsibility 
to educate the next generation 
of college students about the 
consequences of vaping and the 
resources available to help them 
quit. Vaping should not be a blind 
choice: It should be an educated 
choice.

S

oon 
after 
Venezuelan 
President Nicolás Maduro 
secured a second term 
in an election that has since 
been widely regarded as rigged, 
the 
president 
enthusiastically 
greeted crowds of Venezuelans 
gathered outside the presidential 
palace in Caracas for an election 
night celebration. “This was a 
historic day! The day of a heroic 
victory! The day of a beautiful 
victory — of a truly popular 
victory,” Maduro said. 
But other countries don’t 
exactly share Maduro’s gusto 
for those re-election results. 
The Venezuelan leader has faced 
international backlash in the past 
year because he had intimidated 
or 
barred 
opponents 
from 
running. In January, opposition 
leader Juan Guaido assumed an 
interim presidency amid public 
outcry 
against 
the 
corrupt 
Maduro 
regime, 
advocating 
for free and fair elections. The 
United States, Brazil, Argentina, 
Colombia, Chile, Peru, Britain, 
Germany, France, Spain and 
more 
than 
a 
dozen 
other 
members of the European Union 
have all recognized Guaido as the 
legitimate leader of Venezuela, 
and there are indications of 
rising military defections from 
Venezuela. 
Less 
than 
a 
week 
ago, 
El 
Salvador’s 
president 
Nayib 
Bukele 
announced 
that the country would be 
severing diplomatic relations 
with Venezuela. As part of 
this 
decision, 
Venezuelan 
diplomats were given 48 hours 
to 
vacate 
the 
Venezuelan 
embassy. 
In 
retaliation, 
Maduro chose to expel the 
El 
Salvadorian 
diplomats 
from Venezuela, making it 
clear that relations between 
the two countries reached 
an all-time low. The abrupt 
diplomatic shift has caught the 
attention of other countries; 
Guatemala’s government has 
since indicated an interest in 
breaking ties with Maduro’s 
government on Twitter as well. 
Why all the hostility around 
Maduro’s election and past 
political position? Venezuela’s 
political stability has been 
the center of international 
conversation as a result of 
former President Hugo Chavez 

and Nicolás Maduro’s recent 
terms, which have spurred 
what some have termed the 
country’s “free fall”: Hyper-
inflation, 
food 
shortages, 
stifled 
dissent 
and 
mass 
migrations out of the country 
have led many to believe that 
the ongoing systemic crisis in 
Venezuela is exacerbated by 
an unresponsive and corrupt 
president. In particular, the 
recent waves of food and water 
shortages have had devastating 
effects on Venezuelans. Earlier 
this summer, BBC reported 
on power cuts throughout 
the country that forced some 
families in Venezuela to forgo 
cool air in the summer and eat 
rotting meat that decomposed 
in 
no-longer-cool 
fridges. 
Thus, El Salvador’s government 
has maintained the claim it is 
no longer worth it to continue 
diplomatic negotiations with 
a country whose leadership 
has shown an unwillingness to 
change its disturbing behavior.

However, it would be wise to 
exercise some restraint in any 
decision to cut off negotiating 
efforts. Even if El Salvador 
has decided to cut ties with 
Venezuela, the United States 
should 
carefully 
consider 
its own posture towards the 
increasingly dictatorial regime. 
One relevant consideration is 
that sanctions and embargoes 
have mixed legacies both in 
the United States and abroad; 
empirical studies have shown 
that these policy tools are 
more likely to create economic 
pressure without the necessary 
political pressure to spur regime 
change. Failing sanctions on 
Iran 
have 
correlated 
with 

increasing Iranian violations 
of the nuclear deal, and the 
Cuban 
embargo 
has 
only 
further 
cemented 
the 
rift 
between Cuba and the United 
States, without much political 
progress. Democratic countries 
should recall that attempts to 
isolate other governments can 
only further drive Venezuela 
away from the ideals they wish 
to uphold. 
Even if we believe that 
Maduro is to blame for the crisis 
in Venezuela — even if we choose 
to 
forget 
the 
oft-forgotten 
history of U.S. meddling in 
South and Central America — 
Maduro’s claim that the West 
has acted to intervene in Latin 
American politics for personal 
imperialist 
gain 
certainly 
becomes much more persuasive 
when other countries refuse 
to make deals with Venezuela. 
Abandoning 
diplomacy 
only 
risks further pushing Venezuela 
into the arms of countries that 
will allow further oppression 
at Maduro’s hands. Indeed, 
Maduro’s solid grip on political 
power in Venezuela despite the 
mass unrest within the country 
has been sustained by close 
ties to allies such as Russia. 
Russia’s 
overall 
motivations 
in Venezuela are likely too 
complex to fully explore here 
(oil plays a large role in the two 
countries’ relation), but a side 
effect (intentional or otherwise) 
of 
the 
recent 
Russian-
Venezuelan alliance is its effect 
as a “spoiler” for United States-
based efforts in Latin America. 
Even if negotiations between 
the United States and Venezuela 
are difficult, the risk of some 
political deal remains possible 
yet distant given the right 
positive incentives.
But El Salvador’s decision has 
closed that future off entirely, 
as well as attracted the ire of 
a country already teetering 
on 
domestic 
pressures 
and 
instability. The United States 
should be wary of attaining 
the same result: After all, it’s 
conventional 
wisdom, 
and 
perhaps 
intuitive 
political 
reasoning, that honey works 
better than vinegar.

Addressing racial disparities within the student debt crisis

JARED STOLOVE | COLUMN

O

ver the past 17 years, the 
amount of outstanding 
student loan debt in the 
U.S. has increased more than 
sixfold, from less than $240 billion 
to $1.46 trillion. As the value of 
student loan debt has increased, 
so has the longevity of the loans. 
More than 7 million Americans 
over the age of 50 were still paying 
off their student loans in 2017, as 
compared to less than 5 million 
in 2007. With college tuition 
continuing to outpace inflation 
year after year, this trajectory is 
set to continue.
In response to this crisis, almost 
all of the Democratic presidential 
candidates have proposed some 
sort of student debt forgiveness 
policy. 
For 
example, 
Sen. 
Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has 
proposed cancelling up to $50,000 
in student loan debt for over 40 
million Americans who qualify 
based on their income. More 
radically, Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., has proposed forgiving all 
student loan debt, even for the 
very rich. While many of the 
other candidates’ plans are less 
ambitious than those of Warren 
and 
Sanders, 
all 
remaining 
candidates 
have 
identified 
student loan debt alleviation as an 
important issue.
These policies are much more 
than “handouts” to individuals 
who took on more debt than they 
could possibly repay. While the 
causes of the student loan crisis 
are complex, it’s undeniable that 
government policies, such as the 
deregulation of for-profit colleges 
and the utilization of private 
student 
loan 
servicers, 
have 
greatly exacerbated the issue. 
Given the federal government’s 
role in causing this crisis, it has 
a responsibility to address its 
consequences.
Moreover, 
the 
negative 
consequences of excessive student 
debt affect all Americans, not just 
debtors. Studies have shown that 
excessive student debt dampens 
wealth accumulation, hampers the 

growth of small businesses and 
pushes individuals out of lower-
paying public service professions. 
The explanation here is simple: 
College 
graduates 
with 
large 
amounts of student loan debt are 
forced to take jobs that maximize 
their ability to meet their debt 
payments, reducing their ability 
to take risks or invest in long-term 
careers. Forgiving the existing pool 
of student debt is therefore in the 
interest of all Americans.
While 
the 
Democratic 
candidates should be praised for 
their ambitious plans to tackle this 
issue, each of their proposals fail 
to address the way that the student 
loan crisis has disproportionately 
affected people of color. Data 
released by the Department of 
Education in 2017 revealed that 
the student debt crisis has affected 
Black 
and 
white 
Americans 
significantly 
differently. 
Most 
shockingly, the data shows that, 
12 years after taking out student 
loans, 
the 
average 
African 
American 
borrower 
owes 
12 
percent more than they initially 
borrowed. In contrast, the average 
white borrower is three times 
more likely to have paid off their 
debt at that same 12-year mark.
These numbers aren’t simply 
reflective 
of 
the 
correlation 
between race and other factors, 
such as income and geography; 
they reflect additional challenges 
that Black students face at every 
stage of their loan’s life cycle. 
Lawsuits 
against 
for-profit 
colleges that have defrauded their 
students have revealed that these 
businesses intentionally target 
minority students through their 
branding. For example, Ashford 
University, a largely online for-
profit university with a 16 percent 
graduation rate, bragged in a 2018 
press release that it had been 
recognized as a “Top 100 Minority 
Degree Producer.”
Moreover, 
Black 
borrowers 
may be pushed into paying higher 
interest rates on their student 
loans than their white peers. 

While relatively little is known 
about discrimination in student 
loan markets, many studies have 
found that Black borrowers are 
discriminated against when they 
apply for credit cards, auto loans 
and mortgages. For example, 
one study found that African 
Americans are twice as likely as 
whites with similar risk profiles to 
be charged a subjective “markup” 
over their base interest rate on 
auto loans.
However, emerging evidence 
shows that the largest divergence 
between Black and white student 
debt 
burden 
appears 
after 
college. A Brookings Institution 
study found that, at graduation, 
Black students owe $7,400 more 
than their white counterparts, 
a number that balloons to over 
$25,000 in the next four years. 
The study found that a quarter of 
this difference was attributable 
to lower repayment rates, which 
partly reflects the large degree 
of racial discrimination present 
in the labor market. However, 
most of the postgraduate increase 
in the Black-white debt gap 
stemmed from African Americans 
attending 
for-profit 
graduate 
schools at higher rates, suggesting 
that for-profit colleges also target 
minorities for graduate school 
enrollment. 
Each Democratic presidential 
candidate 
has 
attempted 
to 
position himself or herself as an 
advocate for people of color. Yet, 
no Democratic candidate has 
addressed any of these widespread 
issues in their student debt policies 
thus far. If Democrats are to truly 
enact social justice, they need to 
engage with the ways that every 
policy is filtered through a structure 
of intentional and unintentional 
racial discrimination. The existing 
plans, which only forgive loans 
based on income and attempt to 
control costs, will simply leave this 
structure intact.

UK singer Rina Sawayama’s mini-album 
RINA is conspicuously missing from the 2017 
editions of those top-50 album lists every 
major publication puts out at the end of each 
year: Not Pitchfork, not Rolling Stone, not 
NPR, Billboard, SPIN, Consequence of Sound, 
nothing. Maybe it’s just a side effect of writers 
on mainstream 
outlets 
only 
listening 
to 
mainstream 
music. I can’t 
really 
knock 
them for it. I 
didn’t listen to 
RINA 
myself 
until it started 
picking 
up 
steam 
almost 
a 
year 
later, 
but it quickly 
cemented 
itself 
as 
one 
of my favorite 
records 
ever. 
So I wonder 
if, when Rina 
eventually 
(inevitably) 
skyrockets 
into 
pop 
superstardom, 
those same critics will go back and retroactively 
cite it as one of 2017’s best albums.
I call Rina’s superstardom inevitable because 
there is no keeping talent that enormous 
under wraps for long. Her songwriting puts a 
spotlight on some seriously relevant shit right 
from the get-go, with the hilariously titled 
“Ordinary Superstar” calling out celebrities 
that pretend to be normal people through a 
highly curated performance on social media. 
Her woke lyricism on the ordinary superstar 
phenomenon pairs 
well 
with 
her 
own rise to fame. 
She 
brings 
this 
same 
savvy 
wit 
when she sings on 
everything 
from 
East Asian media 
fetishization to the 
anxiety of face-to-
face 
interaction 
in 
the 
digital 
era. No subject is 
safe 
when 
Rina 
is shredding it in 
song. What other 
pop 
artist 
can 
so deftly discuss 
the pressure on 
marginalized 
identities 
and 
sexualities — Rina 
is 
a 
Japanese 
immigrant to the 
UK and identifies 
as 
pansexual 
— 
while still making 
every song a total 
slapper?
My 
most 
personal 
connection to the writing on RINA comes 
on the song “10-20-40.” It delves into Rina’s 
experience with antidepressants, specifically 
citalopram (as identified in her interview 
with The Guardian), a drug prescribed in 
dosages of 10, 20 or 40. Her lyrics speak to 
my own experience taking citalopram with 
startling precision: “Wanted to feel you but I’m 
numb / Don’t even realize who I’ve become.” 
Most unsettling is the way she captures such 
a specific, hard-to-explain experience of 
citalopram, something only another SSRI-taker 
could understand. I 
felt 
misunderstood, 
yet at the same time, 
I couldn’t find clarity 
in my own feelings. 
“See 
they 
don’t 
understand / Don’t 
know who I am / 
But do I?” brings to 
life that paradoxical 
sense 
of 
self-
misunderstanding.
There’s a sweeping 
connection 
in 
the 
image Rina paints on 
“Cyber 
Stockholm 
Syndrome,” a pithy 
song title that invokes 
a 
psychological 
trauma 
in 
her 
relationship 
with 
social media. Such 
an 
invocation 
is 
not 
uncalled 
for: 
An endless pool of 
scholarly 
sources 
show just how much 
social media users feel like shit when they 
use social media but we keep doing it. It’s 
a disturbing and anxiety-inducing subject 
— I wrote a ten-page term paper on the 
dystopia that is social media, so naturally, I 

was intrigued when I saw “Cyber Stockholm 
Syndrome” show up on my Spotify. Rina pulls 
listeners in with a vivid oral illustration — “Girl 
in the corner / Stirring her soda / Biting the shit 
out of her straw” — then amps the track up with 
a quaking drop to the chorus. It’s gorgeous and 
sticky and addictive and that beat drop feels 
like a blast of dopamine to the brain, probably 
not unlike what actually happens in our heads 
when we are validated on social media.
From the very first time I heard “Cyber 
Stockholm 
Syndrome,” 
something 
about 
Rina’s 
music 
felt 
incredibly 
close to home, 
like overnight 
nostalgia. 
It 
was only just 
last 
month 
when 
the 
synaptic 
connection 
finally struck: 
RINA 
is 
caked in the 
influence 
of 
Japanese pop 
icon 
Utada 
Hikaru, 
an 
inspiration so 
clear in Rina’s 
’90s-R&B-
vibe voice that 
the Utada superfan in me felt stupid for not 
noticing it before. (Sure enough, the day after 
my realization, Rina tweeted about meeting 
Utada for the first time.) I don’t think Rina 
ever eclipses Utada’s superhuman singing 
talent — Heart Station remains unrivaled 
in that regard — but Rina has an ace up her 
sleeve.
A 
reflection 
on 
RINA 
wouldn’t 
be 
complete without crediting Clarence Clarity, 
a mysterious and mostly anonymous UK 
musician whose 
experimental 
solo 
material 
seems 
stolen 
from 
an 
elevated 
plane 
of 
existence. 
His 
bizarre 
brilliance 
will 
inevitably be a 
future 
subject 
of my own over-
analysis, 
and 
I 
will 
probably 
only scratch the 
surface 
of 
his 
wicked 
musical 
wizardry. 
For 
now, it’s enough 
to 
know 
that 
his 
creativity 
shines 
just 
as 
strong 
beneath 
Rina’s 
vocals. 
Her smooth diva 
performance 
glows 
over 
Clarence’s cosmic 
beats. If I were to 
inappropriately 
compare 
his 
production on RINA to a natural wonder of 
the United States, I would compare it to none 
other than Crater Lake in Oregon: Pretty and 
shiny on the surface, with layers upon layers of 
depth beneath it (The retro-textured beat on 
“Alterlife” is surely 1,949 feet deep). Clarence 
left his glitchy footprints all over RINA — 
fellow UK producer HOOST produced “Tunnel 
Vision” and “Through The Wire Interlude,” 
and the two collaborated for “Cyber Stockholm 
Syndrome,” but the rest of the album is all 
Clarence. As long as Rina has his Midas touch 
backing her up, she 
is going places.
It’s a mystery to 
me how Rina can 
be so full of wit in 
her writing, and 
how she managed 
to 
connect 
with 
an 
enigmatic 
musical 
savant-
like 
Clarence 
Clarity, but thank 
the 
Lord 
that 
she is a goddess 
with the pen and 
she did make a 
match in heaven 
with one of the 
most 
interesting 
producers 
in 
the game. RINA 
is 
a 
tongue-in-
cheek take on the 
digital landscape’s 
destruction 
of 
interpersonal 
relationships. It’ll 
stay relevant until society overthrows its 
cyber oppression, a revolution I have no faith 
in, so RINA might just be — dare I say it — a 
timeless record.

AMC’s five-part documentary miniseries 
“The Preppy Murder: Death in Central Park” 
examines Jennifer Levin’s murder, a case made 
infamous by the media circus surrounding the 
trial of her killer. The docuseries retraces how 
one murder came to represent an entire decade 
and illustrate the role of class and racial privilege 
in the justice system.
In the early morning of Aug. 26th, 1986, a 
bicyclist discovered an 18-year-old woman’s 
body under a tree in Central Park. Later identified 
as Jennifer Levin, the victim was assaulted and 
strangled to death some time after she was 
seen leaving popular teen hangout, Dorrian’s 
Red Hand. The crime rate in New York was 
reaching new heights due to the crack epidemic, 
but the circumstances 
of 
Jennifer’s 
death 
were unlike the drug-
related 
murders 
the 
NYPD 
had 
investigated. A young 
white woman found 
dead in Central Park 
immediately 
piqued 
police interest, and 
made Levin’s case a 
top priority. 
Within 
hours, 
police had identified 
the 
popular 
and 
wealthy 
19-year-old 
Robert Chambers as 
a person of interest in 
her murder. Although police first approached 
him as a potential witness, Chambers appeared 
to have multiple injuries consistent with Levin’s 
attack and later confessed to accidentally killing 
her after rejecting her advances. He quickly 
hired lawyers who built their defense around 
Chambers’ claim that Levin died as a result of 
him accidentally injuring her when he rejected 
her attempt to initiate “rough sex.”
Much of the series consists of personal 
interviews with Jennifer’s close friends and 
family who describe how she came to enter the 
prep school social circles as an outsider. The 
documentary also interviews various tabloid 
writers and field reporters who followed the 
case from its start and were largely responsible 
for creating public interest in the killing. Many 
of these media representatives explicitly stated 

they felt the murder of a white female was more 
“interesting” than crimes against minorities, 
which were often assumed to be drug-related. 
Reporters also jumped on the sexual element 
of the case and put emphasis on Jennifer’s, not 
Robert’s, social history.
“The Preppy Murder” uses its first two parts 
to make its purpose clear: Depict Jennifer Levin 
as she was, not as she was portrayed by the 
defense, and ask how a seemingly open-and-
shut case became one of the most controversial 
trials of the decade. Intertwined with the facts 
of the case, the experiences of family members, 
friends, police officers, lawyers and reporters 
connected to Jennifer’s story are included 
in order to emphasize the importance of the 
crime’s social and political context. In addition 
to the grisly details of Levin’s injuries, one of 
the most disturbing features of the docuseries is 
how familiar the whole case feels. 
The current social 
conversation 
about 
acknowledging 
privilege 
has 
made 
the case of Jennifer 
Levin one of a host 
of other examples of 
what happens when 
actions 
are 
rarely 
met with appropriate 
consequences. An air 
of entitlement infects 
every aspect of the case 
and is most evident in 
footage of Chambers’s 
interrogation 
and 
subsequent 
confession. In every 
alteration to his story, every denigration of 
Jennifer’s character, every outburst against 
his interviewers, Chambers oozes the smug, 
sociopathic confidence of a man who thinks 
the investigation is beneath him. This attitude 
is hauntingly reminiscent of the arrogance 
exhibited by many of the men facing accusations 
of sexual assault in the #MeToo era. 
Like 
many 
other 
recent 
true 
crime 
documentaries, “The Preppy Murder” knows 
that just acknowledging what went wrong in 
this case has not and will not change things. 
The manipulation of the media and pervasive 
bias in favor of Chambers cannot be undone 
or erased. However, for “The Preppy Murder,” 
understanding the injustice and prejudice of this 
case will remind the American public of what it 
still owes Jennifer Levin and victims like her.

Billie Holiday once famously sang, “Autumn 
in New York, why does it seem so inviting?” 
Indeed, there’s a certain magic inherent to 
the fall season. But, while New York holds an 
alluring sway (I’m a New Yorker myself), I would 
argue that there’s a greater force at work than 
the call of the Big Apple when the leaves change 
color. Holiday is right about one thing: Fall is the 
season of jazz and swing. 
Think about it — there’s something incredibly 
fitting about embracing the music of an age 
gone by as nature sheds it summer green in 
exchange for autumnal reds and golds. There’s 
just something about the gravelly voice of Louis 
Armstrong when the wind howls, the warmth of 
a blazing saxophone solo and the romance of the 
music combining with that of the season.
But listening to swing doesn’t mean you have 
to barrel back into the past. The old hits are 
classics, but it’s time to make some room on 
the stage for new artists to continue the grand 
tradition of the genre. Here are a handful of 
contemporary bands who might just bring forth 
the new “Roaring ’20s” — after all, 2020 sits on 
the horizon, and history tends to repeat itself. 
Postmodern Jukebox, or PMJ, is an interesting 
beast. Created from the musical imagination of 
Scott Bradlee with the intent to bring “classic 
sounds (he) loved back into the mainstream,” 
PMJ quickly grew in scope, talent and popularity. 
The PMJ roster hosts nearly 100 musicians in all, 
including both vocalists and instrumentalists. 
Rather than a traditional band with the same 
members performing every track, PMJ “rotates” 
their musicians, with every song, album, or 
live performance offering a different musical 
combination, or as Bradlee puts it, a “rotating 
collective of musical outcasts.” The most fun 
thing about PMJ, however, is that they don’t just 
cover classic swing or jazz songs, or even write 
their own — no, they take modern, contemporary 
hits from any and every genre, and reshape 
them into vintage-style jazz/swing tracks. Like, 
for instance, a swing cover of Florence and the 
Machine’s “Dog Days Are Over,” or a smokey 
jazz-club version of Radiohead’s “Creep.”
Pink Martini, founded by politician Thomas 
Lauderdale, started as a musical group meant to 

provide entertainment to lackluster fundraisers 
and political events. Then, Lauderdale met 
vocalist China Forbes, and thus Lauderdale’s 
“little orchestra” became the multilingual jazz 
band Pink Martini we know today. To jump 
into the world of Pink Martini, start with their 
original hit “Hang on Little Tomato.” Not only 
is it a fun song — as the title suggests, about a 
lonely tomato who’s stuck in the rain — but 
the track works as a great example that not 
everything has been done before. When it comes 
to revitalizing genres whose heyday has come 
and past, there tends to be a general sense of 
“Well, what left is there to do?” Pink Martini’s 
answer: Sing about vegetables. And you know 
what? It works. Garden veggies aside, the band 
is unique in its strong dose of “international 
flavor.” Lead singer China Forbes regularly 
performs in various languages, including tracks 
(and even entire albums) sung in French or 
Spanish. Take “Sympathique,” a song composed 
in the traditional style of old-French music. Pink 
Martini, like many modern groups who foray 
into jazz and swing, do not limit themselves 
solely to those two genres. A characteristic that 
makes them even more fun to listen to — you 
never know exactly what to expect, but secure 
in the knowledge that disappointment is a non-
player. 
One would think Madeleine Peyroux had 
hopped right out of Woody Allen’s “Midnight 
in Paris” if common sense didn’t reason better. 
Her voice, slow and hypnotic, was born to be 
matched with the slow beat of a double bass and 
easy improvisation of the piano. Notable songs 
include her cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Dance Me 
to the End of Love,” her take on Frank Sinatra’s 
beloved “The Summer Wind,” and more. Yet her 
songs, while seemingly timeless, still contain a 
modern touch in the lilt of her voice. Her songs 
also lack the busy instrumentation characteristic 
of classic swing or jazz bands, but this absence 
allows Peyroux to maximize the charm of her 
voice, as if she’s a snake charmer and we’re the 
coiled serpent rising to her coaxing song. 
A special mention for Jeff Goldblum, too — 
but read our latest review of Goldblum’s new 
album for the full scoop. Take a chance to see 
how different the streets of Ann Arbor feel on 
a blisteringly cold evening with a well-formed 
swing playlist to keep you company on the 
journey.

BOOK REVIEW

I know mysteries. I read them all the time. 
Before applying my Origins overnight face 
mask, I might sneak in a couple of pages of 
Ruth Ware’s latest release. At airports, I make 
it my tradition to stop at Hudson Booksellers 
to grab a New York Times best-selling 
thriller to keep me preoccupied during my 
flight. They’re easy. 
They’re formulaic. 
There’s that mantra 
of “not everything 
is 
as 
it 
seems” 
embedded in each 
page. There’s the 
unreliable narrator 
and, if we’re lucky, 
the 
alcoholic 
detective. To top 
it off, there’s the 
clichéd twist at the 
very end. I know 
what to expect. 
“The 
Family 
Upstairs” 
is 
different. 
The 
novel opens from 
the perspective of 
Libby, phoning her 
mother 
to 
reveal 
news 
that 
she’s 
been 
waiting 
for 
her 25th birthday 
to announce. Libby 
simply 
tells 
her 
mom, 
“They’ve 
left me the house.” 
Hidden in this seemingly blasé report is 
the news that Libby has transitioned from 
a woman that splurged on inconsequential 
cosmetics and saved up six months of her 
hard-earned money for a weekend trip to 
Barcelona to the owner of a multi-million 
dollar mansion on Sixteen Cheyne Walk, 
SW3 Chelsea. It’s easy to understand the 
magnitude of her transformation by her own 
thoughts: “Now she owns a house in Chelsea 
and the proportions of her existence have 
been 
blown 
apart.” 
Indeed, 
Libby’s 
“existence has 
been 
blown 
apart,” but not 
in the way that 
she thinks. In 
the 
process 
of 
becoming 
a 
very 
rich 
woman, Libby 
investigates 
the 
sinister 
origins of the 
Chelsea house. 
Twenty-five years earlier, police were called 
by a “concerned” neighbor to 16 Cheyne 
Walk. There, in the kitchen, were three dead 
bodies: An elegant woman, a man with salt-
and-pepper hair and another unidentifiable 

man. They were dressed in black, hands 
clasped together. Upstairs, a baby was 
crying. According to the police report, their 
deaths have been deemed a suicide, but the 
circumstances are strange. Why hasn’t the 
family been seen in public for months? Who 
took care of the baby weeks after the parents 
died? And, most importantly, where are the 
other four children who supposedly lived in 
the Chelsea house? 
The novel is told in three perspectives 
— Libby Jones, Lucy 
and Henry — during 
the past and present. 
Whenever 
I’m 

immersed in the point-
of-views 
of 
several 
characters 
early 
in 
the novel, I tend to get 
distracted. I’m usually 
not 
invested 
enough 
in each character to 
continue reading. I 
didn’t feel that with 
“The Family Upstairs.” 
Each character offered 
relevant 
information 
that served to spur my 
curiosity more. Libby, 
Lucy and Henry could 
have easily been written 
as plot devices solely to 
heighten the stakes of 
the mystery. Instead, 
we delve deeply into 
their personal history 
and characterizations. 
Certainly, 
they 

are 
related 
to 
the 
mysterious 
Chelsea 
deaths in some way, but we’re only given bits 
and crumbs in each chapter. In the process, 
we learn the ways that Lucy juggles life as 
a homeless single mother and, in the past, 
Henry’s tumultuous relationship with his 
father as well as his burgeoning romance 
with a lanky blond-haired boy. Even as I 
approached the half-way point of the novel, 
I couldn’t have predicted where it would 
end up. Deliciously cult-ish, dark and 
surprisingly touching, “The Family Upstairs” 
subverts 
the 
traditional 
mystery-
thriller, 
blending 
together 
multiple 
genres. Don’t 
get me wrong, 
“The 
Family 
Upstairs” 
is 
still 
the 
perfect 
book 
to 
grab 
in 
between 
layovers, 
though 
at 
the same time, the mystery tropes are not 
overwrought. This attentive style and plot 
that Jewell has crafted will leave even a 
jaded mystery expert like myself guessing 
until the very end.

‘Family Upstairs’ is more

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

This past Thursday evening, Hankinson Rehearsal Hall 
hosted an improvisational performance from the Creative Arts 
Orchestra. The orchestra consisted of SMTD students with a 
combination of violin, viola, trumpet, piano, melodica, voice and 
various percussion instruments.
The element of improvisation is what 
sets the Creative Arts Orchestra apart 
from other musical groups at SMTD. 
Improvisation involves a lack of musical 
guidance — no conductors, sheet music 
or organized practicing — in addition 
to the creative use of instruments, such 
as banging on stringed instruments or 
applying paper to piano strings for a 
crunch-like sound.
Each of the six musicians were free 
to play whatever they pleased, with 
no prior restrictions on what to play. 
That said, for some pieces there were 
certain “filters,” as SMTD professor 
Mark Kirschenmann called them, in 
place for the orchestra to fall in line 
with.
For one set, Kirschenmann informed 
the 
audience, 
“We 
will 
all 
play 
keyboard instruments, and we are all going to sing, other than 
that I have no idea what is going to happen.”
For another set, Weston Gilbert, the orchestra’s violinist, 
presented the orchestra with a brief sheet of music with certain 
chords and soloing sections for the individual musicians to 
follow. Outside of the framework of pitches for each musician to 
choose from, the rest of the set was all improvisational. In fact, 
I had a chance to take a look at the sheet of musical frameworks 
written by Gilbert. It was a sparse piece of music with only a few 

complex chord progressions. The final measure featured a single 
note for each musician to aim for as an end goal.
Outside of the musical framework, I was curious as to how each 
musician decided what to play and what noises to make. After 
the show, I spoke with Maya Johnson, an SMTD composition 
Master’s student, who was on the viola for the group.
“I pay attention to what is or is not being done,” Johnson said 
when asked how she decided what to play. “If everyone is playing 
long notes, I tend to do the opposite.” It is this sense of opposites 
attracting that I believe made the show 
so interesting. “I also have my bag of 
tricks ... I’m the only viola, so a low 
C is never a bad move.” Johnson took 
into account the unique properties of 
her own instrument and used these 
properties to add a new dimension to 
the improvisational work.
The improvisation involved little 
harmonization and few instances of 
synchronized sound. However, the few 
moments of resolve were welcomed, 
like an oasis in a sea of musical 
confusion. I found that I wanted to 
keep listening in hopes of hearing such 
a satisfying resolve or a discernable 
melody.
In terms of the sounds themselves, 
much of the improvisation actually 
had repeating tropes. Much of the 
concert sounded very “L.A. Noire” or like “The Twilight Zone,” 
an eerie and unsettling soundtrack for a winter night. With a 
muted trumpet and a ringing vibraphone, I felt as though I was 
supposed to be solving a mystery.
I felt unsettled, discontented with the music being played 
and what I was hearing, which is perhaps the purpose behind 
this improvisational method. The dissonance and discomfort 
builds to a point of relief, when the sounds finally assemble and 
come to a close.

Juwan Howard has already 
been the Michigan basketball 
coach for nearly six months, 
and you’d still be hard-pressed 
to find a day that’s gone by 
without 
him 
mentioning 
confidence.
A 
19-year 
NBA 
veteran 
himself, Howard understands 
the value of confidence better 
than most. Though he’s a first-
time head coach, he saw it 
first-hand during his six-year 
stint as an assistant with the 
Miami Heat.
Now, he’s applying it in Ann 
Arbor.
Sophomore 
guard 
David 
DeJulius is the perfect case 
study. As a high school senior, 
the Detroit native averaged 
26.3 points, 8.1 assists and 7.7 
rebounds en route to a third-
place 
finish 
in 
Michigan’s 
Mr. Basketball voting. Fast 
forward to the next year, when 
he played a grand total of just 
five minutes in the Wolverines’ 
eight January games and didn’t 
score a point.
“Last year, you might get a 
few minutes at a time, so you’re 
trying to make sure that you 
make a basket or something,” 
DeJulius said. “(It) was really, 
really rough for me because 
I really spent a lot of time 
devoting my life to basketball, 
so it was really tough not 
playing.”
That’s no longer the case, 
and DeJulius has Howard to 
thank.
DeJulius 
has 
posted 
a 
combined 19 points and 15 
rebounds 
on 
60-percent 
shooting across the last two 
games. He hasn’t hesitated 
to let it fly from beyond the 
arc, with seven of his 10 shots 
during that span coming from 
deep. Despite barely scraping 
the six-foot mark, DeJulius 
ranks second on the team in 

rebounds, trailing only 7-foot-1 
center Jon Teske.
So far this season, DeJulius 
has 
been 
visibly 
more 
comfortable with the ball in his 
hands, especially in transition. 
Though a three-game stretch is 
a small sample size, he’s played 
at least 30 more minutes than 
any other reserve.
“This is like giving CPR to 
my basketball career,” DeJulius 
said.
Under Howard, DeJulius’ 
fellow 
sophomores 
are 
undergoing 
a 
similar 
renaissance. Forwards Brandon 
Johns Jr. and Colin Castleton 
have provided a combined 82 
frontcourt minutes off the 
bench, while sophomore guard 
Adrien Nunez, who saw more 
than five minutes of action in 
only one game last season, has 
started each of Michigan’s first 
three contests.
“I feel confident out there on 
the offensive floor,” Castleton 
said. “(Howard) is just saying 
the 
same 
things 
everyday, 
preaching the same things into 
our ears everyday so we hear 

it every single day whether it’s 
film, walkthroughs, practice or 
even (when he) sees us outside 
of practice, just implementing 
that into our heads so we can 
hear positive things, positive 
thoughts no matter what it is 
on the court. (He’s) telling us 
that he trusts us, and having a 
coach that trusts you gives you 
a lot of confidence.
For a Michigan program 
that 
could’ve 
easily 
spent 
the first month of the season 
reeling from the departures 
of former coach John Beilein 
and last year’s three leading 
scorers, the emergence of the 
sophomore class has provided 
a much-needed spine. Even 
with prized freshman wing 
Franz Wagner on the shelf due 
to a wrist fracture, the early-
season 
confidence 
appears 
contagious.
With 
the 
Wolverines 
nearing a stretch of games 
against ranked opponents, they 
might just score a few resumé-
building wins if the confidence 
Howard has instilled continues 
giving way to on-court results.

Half of Michigan’s backcourt 
for the season has never been in 
doubt. 
Zavier Simpson, senior point 
guard and leader of the Michigan 
men’s basketball team, has had 
his starting spot locked up since 
before Juwan Howard came on as 
head coach.
The 
other 
guard, 
though, 
has been a question mark since 
an injury to freshman forward 
Franz Wagner has forced Eli 
Brooks into starting at the 
‘3.’ For the beginning of the 
season, Howard has turned to 
sophomore guard Adrien Nunez 
to complete his starting five. 
But as Nunez has struggled on 
both ends of the court, Howard 
has 
relied 
increasingly 
on 
another sophomore guard: David 
DeJulius.
Usually the first off the bench, 
DeJulius has embraced his sixth-
man role on this team.
“That’s kind of my identity,” 
DeJulius said. “Before the season, 
we had our meeting to make sure 

I can affect the game, and make 
sure that I’m improving and 
getting to another level, so that’s 
my job. That’s my main focus.
“I just try to be aggressive — 
take what the defense gives me, 
and at the same time, defend. I 
don’t get any plays ran for me, 
really, but I just continue to stay 
aggressive. I just play my role and 
do whatever I can to stay out there 
on the floor.”
But he may not be the sixth 
man for long. 
Despite having started in all 
three of the Wolverines’ games 
this season, Nunez has only 
played 41 minutes 
—the other four 
starters average 
98.5. As it stands 
now, 
DeJulius 
ranks 
fifth 
on 
the 
team 
in 
minutes played, 
with 81 on the 
season, followed 
sophomore 
forward Brandon 
Johns 
Jr., 
and 
then Nunez.
In 
crunch 
time 
during 
the 
season 
opener 
against 
Appalachian State, when the 
Mountaineers 
whittled 
the 
Wolverines’ 30-point lead to a 
slim four-point margin, DeJulius 
— not Nunez – was Michigan’s 
second guard.
Howard, 
it 
seems, 
trusts 
DeJulius, and is leaning on him 
more and more.
“He’s super confident, and 
that’s great – he’s a competitor,” 
Howard said after Michigan’s 
20-point defeat over Elon on 
Friday. “David wants it. He puts in 
a lot of work – comes in at practice, 
comes in on off days. Now he’s 
just getting up shots, but he’s also 
getting into the film, learning the 
game, and that’s some of the best 
teaching right there, so overall, 
I’m so happy for him.”
DeJulius has not let his coach 
down. He’s shooting 46.2 percent 
from the field, and an impressive 

37.5 percent on his three-point 
attempts. 
In statistic after statistic, he 
leads the bench. His rebounding 
— a favorite point of Howard’s — 
has looked better and better over 
each game, notching 17 on the 
season so far, second-highest on 
the team behind only Teske.
“We talk about rebounding a 
lot, but that’s just something that 
I do, because every game, I don’t 
hit shots – that’s just kind of how 
it is – but at the end of the game, I 
want to know that I affected the 
game defensively, and rebounded 
the ball,” DeJulius said. “You 
can’t be mad at 
yourself if you 
know you gave it 
your all at the end 
of the game.”
Nunez, 
though, 
has 
been less than 
stellar, shooting 
41.7 
percent 
from the field, 
and 30 percent 
from the arc. At 
times, he’s appeared to struggle 
defensively, 
playing 
just 
11 
minutes in last Tuesday’s game 
against Creighton, easily the 
most talented competition this 
Michigan team has faced so far 
this season.
More and more, it seems that 
DeJulius is the natural choice to 
start, and that it’s only a matter 
of time before he does. After 
riding the bench for much of his 
freshman year, looking up to 
and learning from Simpson, it’s a 
challenge DeJulius is ready for. 
“Every game, I’m just trying to 
continue to grow, I’m continuing 
to grow,” DeJulius said. “I’m still 
going through growing pains, 
getting more experience, so I try 
not to rush anything. I just try to 
take whatever the defense gives 
me.
“Each and every game, I watch 
film, and see where I can be more 
aggressive, and I just feel like it’s 
more of a feeling thing.”

Wolverines drop Big Ten final on PKs

It took penalties to decide 
the winner of the Big Ten 
Tournament.
A 
high-intensity 
Big 
Ten 
championship match resulted in 
a battle between Michigan (11-
4-5 overall, 4-1-3 Big Ten) and 
Indiana’s (14-2-4, 7-1-0) freshmen 
goalkeepers. 
The 
Wolverines 
ultimately fell to the eighth-
ranked 
Hoosiers 
4-3 
during 
penalty kicks.
“I’m really, really proud of their 
effort, their commitment, their 
quality today, and certainly we’re 
disappointed,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “We thought 
that we could be champions. PKs 
is a harsh way to lose, but at some 
point you gotta decide the game.”
At the start of the game, 
Indiana 
had 
control 
of 
the 
midfield, using its physicality to 
block off Michigan players from 
the ball and aggressively maintain 
possession. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
midfielders’ attempts to push back 
were often thwarted. However, 
Michigan’s back line proved to be 
its reliable strength as the defense 
limited Indiana’s opportunities on 
goal. Freshman goalkeeper Owen 
Finnerty made an impressive save 
14 minutes into the half to stop 
Indiana forward Victor Bezerra’s 
powerful shot from just outside 
of the box. Finnerty deflected the 

shot for a corner kick, showing 
that he has what it takes to fill the 
cleats of Big Ten goalkeeper of the 
year, Michigan senior Andrew 
Verdi, who has been out since 
October 25 after suffering an 
injury against Wisconsin.
The Wolverines’ front line 
was finally able to ramp up the 
pressure on the Indiana goal in 
the final two minutes of the first 
half, and they kept that aggressive 
mentality in the second half 
when they started to dominate 
possession.
The Wolverines earned their 
spot in Sunday’s championship 
after defeating Penn State 1-0 in 
the semifinals Friday afternoon, 
when 
senior 
forward 
Jack 
Hallahan scored a strong free 
kick shot up and over the wall of 
Penn State defenders and chipped 
off the post before connecting 
inside the net.
Sophomore forward Derick 
Broche continued to be involved 
in plays towards the box during 
Friday’s semifinal, being one of 
the main point-producers for the 
team overall this season with six 
goals and three assists. But in 
Sunday’s championship, Broche 
missed a golden opportunity in 
the second half for the Wolverines 
to secure a goal in the second half 
inside the six-yard box when his 
attempt to hit the far post missed 
over the net.
The Wolverines had other 

opportunities during the second 
half with six shots on goal, 
while the Hoosiers had zero — a 
surprise, 
considering 
Indiana 
had 22 shots during its semifinal 
matchup against Maryland.
Michigan’s final fate would 
have been different if it could have 
capitalized on one of its chances 
on goal during the second half.
In 
the 
penalty 
shootout, 
Finnerty was unable to make a 
second save to maintain the 3-3 
tie and the Hoosiers celebrated 
their second straight Big Ten 
Tournament victory.
The Wolverines held the No. 
8 team to just four shots during 
the match. Despite the loss, this 
championship game marked their 
10th shut-out of the season, a 
program record.
Now, Michigan awaits the 
announcement of the NCAA 
DI men’s soccer bracket on 
Monday. The top-16 teams will 
host the opening rounds of the 
tournament.
“We’ll play another home game 
at Michigan in the near future, 
hopefully it’s Sunday so our guys 
can get a little bit of rest and we’ll 
go from there. But I think we’re 
definitely deserving of a top-16 
seed,” Daley said. “It’s the first 
time in our program’s history 
we’ve gone for three NCAA 
Tournaments in a row, so it’s an 
exciting time for the growth of 
our program.”

The Michigan men’s soccer team lost to Indiana, 4-3, in the Big Ten Tournament final on Sunday afternoon.

Lambert’s woes emblematic of team

With one quick look up 
the ice, Cam York knew his 
teammate had a chance to make 
a game-tying play.
The freshman defenseman 
saw sophomore forward Jimmy 
Lambert streaking through the 
neutral zone and fired a stretch 
pass from blueline to blueline, 
right to the tape on Lambert’s 
stick. Lambert had a step on 
defenseman 
Jerad 
Rosburg, 
and freshman forward Nick 
Granowicz was just behind 
Lambert coming down the right 
side of the ice.
Lambert had a split second 
to decide whether to shoot the 
puck himself or pass across to 
Granowicz on the backdoor. 
That split second grew into 
a full second, then two. The 
hesitation 
gave 
Rosburg 
a 
chance to sprawl across the ice 
to block the shot he thought was 
coming — but it never came.
As he searched for the right 
decision, Lambert overhandled 
the puck and lost 
control of it. A 
brief moment of 
lost control led 
to a neutralized 
scoring chance. 
Instantly, 
Michigan’s 
chance to tie the 
game was gone.
“He was trying 
to 
rush 
and 
then whether to 
shoot or pass, I think he was 
in between and he just lost 
control of it,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson on Monday. 
“That sort of sums up not only 
how the weekend went but 
how our season is going right 
now. We get a great play, great 
stretch pass coming in and 
then you get overthinking and 
you overhandle it and the next 
thing you know, you’re losing 
the puck.”
It wasn’t the first time in 
the 
Wolverines’ 
seven-game 
winless skid that Lambert has 
missed on a Grade-A scoring 
chance.
On Nov. 8 against Minnesota, 
freshman 
forward 
Johnny 

Beecher sent a pass to a wide-
open Lambert on the doorstep 
of the net. Lambert fanned on 
his attempt at a shot before 
tumbling onto the ice, his 
chance at a game-winning goal 
gone.
“Good opportunity coming 
down the slot, just whiffs on it,” 
Pearson said after that game. 
“He had three or four (whiffs). 
Once you’re not scoring and 
you’re a forward, you really 
start to press. 
... It can get in 
your head, and 
we’ve 
got 
to 
get 
somebody 
in here to calm 
these guys and 
have them relax 
and not worry 
about 
that, 
because 
it’ll 
come.”
For Lambert, 
so far, it hasn’t.
He has been held without 
a point since Oct. 19 and has 
only one goal and one assist all 
season.
“I don’t really care, honestly,” 
Lambert said. “I’ve been getting 
chances every night, so — a lot 
of people in my life have always 
told me that if you’re not getting 
chances, then it’s time to be 
worried. But I’ve been getting 
chances every night, so sooner 
or later, it’s going to go in.”
And 
while 
Lambert’s 
offensive slump stands out after 
he led all freshmen in points 
last year with four goals and 
nine assists, his difficulties are 
only one example of a problem 

that’s spread throughout the 
locker room for Michigan. In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
seven-game 
skid, they’ve scored two or more 
goals in a game just twice and 
have been shut out once.
“I think we’re so uptight 
right now,” Pearson said. “Just 
relax and be the player you 
are and just simplify it. We are 
overhandling the puck. The 
more you handle it, the more 
opportunity you have to lose it 
or to miscue with it. Just keep 
it simple.”
No one around the program 
seems overly concerned about 
the lack of offensive output. 
The common refrain is that 
Michigan is getting chances and 
working hard, and eventually 
the Wolverines’ luck will turn 
and pucks will go in the net.
But 
through 
12 
games, 
Michigan ranks 43rd of 60 
teams in the nation with 23 
total goals and 51st in goals per 
game at 1.92. The Wolverines 
are dead last in the Big Ten 
standings with only one point of 
the 18 possible.
If Michigan is going to 
turn this around, players like 
Lambert will need to step up and 
become consistent contributors.
But as Lambert has shown 
lately, 
getting 
opportunities 
isn’t 
enough. 
Games 
aren’t 
decided by shot differential, 
they’re decided by goals scored 
— and the Wolverines have 
demonstrated an inability to put 
the puck in the net.
And there’s no prize at the 
end of the season for the team 
with the most opportunities.

Ahead of matchup with Hoosiers, Wolverines shrug off ‘trap game’ cliche

There are tropes that should 
naturally come along with this 
week, narratives pre-constructed 
to fill a certain template.
The week after… The week 
before… Trap game in between… 
In the aftermath of a 44-10 
drubbing 
of 
in-state 
rival 
Michigan State and less than two 
weeks from The Game, there is a 
propensity to look past Indiana — 
the foe sandwiched in between.
That’s also, in some ways, 
become an expired cliché.
In the four times the Wolverines 
have played the Hoosiers in the 
Jim Harbaugh era, two of those 
matchups have ended in overtime. 
The other two were close games 
in which the host pulled away late. 
At Monday’s press availability, 
reporters thus lined up to ask how 
Michigan would avoid looking 
past its opponent. What was 
lacking was the natural follow-
up: Is it really a trap game if the 
players and coaches pretty clearly 
see the bait?
“I don’t think it’s difficult to 
look past this week at all,” said 
fifth-year senior left tackle Jon 

Runyan. “Indiana was ranked in 
the AP Poll last week, they were 
down by three to Penn State 
with, I think, nine minutes to go. 
... They’re a good offense, kind of 
similar to what we do. It’ll be fun 
to see how they match up with our 
defense, but definitely can’t look 
past this Indiana team. Last few 
times we’ve been to Bloomington 
and gone to overtime. 
“There’s just something about 
them that they kind of always get 
the best of us.”
This year, in particular, few in 
and around Schembechler Hall 
are under any illusions about the 
challenge of going to Indiana. The 
Hoosiers boast the top passing 
offense in the Big Ten, now led 
by senior quarterback Peyton 
Ramsey, 
who 
has 
completed 
over 72 percent of his passes and 
tossed 10 touchdowns to just 
three interceptions in five games 
this year.
Indiana has totaled at least 
27 points in each of its last six 
games. The Hoosiers will be one 
of the most difficult offenses — 
schematically and talent-wise — 
Michigan faces all year. 
That’s the only real trap here.
“Sometimes, 
the 
Indiana 

offenses have been a little bit of 
a departure from what we’ve 
played throughout the year — the 
potential of hurry-up, the threat 
of that,” said fifth-year senior 
linebacker 
Jordan 
Glasgow. 
“Obviously spacing you out as 
much as they can. We need to 
prepare for that.”
Added Harbaugh: “I think 
it’s challenging as any offense 
in the Big Ten. Receivers that 
are dynamic and can make plays 
down the field. Fast. Catch the 
ball and run with it.”
For now, the Wolverines are 
riding high, undoubtedly playing 
their best football of the season. 
Saturday’s win marked the high 
point for an offense that had 
slowly grown from its early season 
mishaps.
In an honest moment, players 
would admit the rest of this 
season boils down to the outcome 
of the Ohio State game. As that 
allure draws closer — the chance 
to re-configure narratives and 
dynamics — it’s mere human 
nature 
to 
prepare. 
That’s 
accentuated in a year where the 
self-assigned 
“game-by-game” 
mentality is cheapened by a lack 
of viable postseason aspirations.

Asked 
whether 
suppressing 
that 
foresight 
needs 
to 
be 
expressed verbally, Harbaugh did 
not even entertain the premise.
“Yeah, I mean, we come off a 
big game against Michigan State,” 
he said, “and you come back to 
work, regroup, refit, retool, get 
ready for your next opponent.”
It just so turns out that the 

next opponent comes with a set 
of challenges all its own. A game 
that could sneakily make the case 
for most impressive road win of 
the Harbaugh era, were it to come 
to fruition. 
“They 
kind 
of 
have 
this 
momentum 
carrying 
them, 
having a good season,” Runyan 
said. “I’m sure they’re going to 

have a lot of fans come out, more 
than usual. I haven’t watched too 
much film on them yet, but I know 
there’s something really special 
going on over there.”
Which is to say, if anyone’s 
peering down the track past 
Saturday, 
they 
sure 
seem 
cognizant of the hurdle waiting in 
between.

Cam McGrone growing beyond speed

Every time Cam McGrone took 
to the practice field during the week 
leading up to Michigan’s game 
against Rutgers, his body shook 
with nerves.
A 
few 
days 
earlier, 
junior 
linebacker Josh Ross went down 
with an injury against Wisconsin, 
thrusting 
the 
Wolverines’ 
established 
starting 
linebacker 
trio into peril. As the top choice to 
step in for Ross, McGrone’s first 
impressions weren’t resoundingly 
positive 
— 
his 
highlight-reel 
goal-line stuff contrasted missed 
assignments in a 35-14 loss to the 
Badgers.
Still, the redshirt freshman 
linebacker was the clear choice to 
take over as Michigan’s starting 
middle linebacker when Ross’ 
injury developed into a multi-
week absence. The message from 
defensive coordinator Don Brown 
was simple: Just be ready.
Two months later, McGrone 
has done that and then some, 
developing into a permanent starter 
as a now-healthy Ross watches 
from the sidelines to preserve his 
redshirt.
“(McGrone brings) physicality, 
speed,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “And getting better and 
better with understanding all the 

adjustments to the defensive calls. 
His responsibilities and the others 
around him. Just playing really 
good football.”
Those attributes — namely his 
speed — are what pop off the field 
on Saturdays. They’re what draw 
comparisons to Devin Bush and 
have the Wolverines salivating 
about what McGrone could become.
To get there, he had to become 
more than just speed.
“Seeing him as a freshman, I 
thought that he was very mature 
for where he stood when he came 
in,” said fifth-year senior linebacker 
Jordan Glasgow. “I felt, physically 
and mentally, that he was at a 
pretty high level already. And then 
he made a big improvement from 
freshman to sophomore year. And 
obviously you can see how good of 
a player he is now.”
As 
the 
MIKE 
linebacker 
in 
Brown’s 
defense, 
McGrone 
is 
sandwiched 
between 
the 
experienced duo of Glasgow and 
senior VIPER Khaleke Hudson. 
And yet, he carries the most 
responsibility, 
diagnosing 
an 
offense’s formation as it unfolds.
“As a MIKE linebacker, you have 
everything on your shoulders,” 
McGrone said. “So it hasn’t gotten 
any worse, any better. But it’s 
definitely just been fun to be there, 
kinda like the middle of the defense, 
helping everybody out.”

It’s a responsibility seemingly at 
odds with McGrone’s inexperience, 
but through seven career starts, 
that’s the marriage he’s making.
“Just being out there, running 
the plays that I’ve been running for 
over a year and really seeing it in 
real time on the big stage, it kinda 
clicks like that,” McGrone said. 
“Because it has to because the next 
play, it could be the same thing.”
Ask McGrone himself and he’ll 
tell you he’s a slow learner — the 
type of player who needs a year 
of experience before being ready 
to jump into heavy playing time. 
Ask anyone else and they’ll extoll 
his ability to step in for Ross and 
immediately become the linchpin of 
Michigan’s defense.
It’s why, when Glasgow — a 
Butkus Award semifinalist for the 
nation’s best linebacker — was 
asked about his personal accolades, 
he deflected, saying, “I feel like I 
play with better linebackers than 
myself.”
Throughout his career, that’s 
been true because of players more 
experienced than him — players 
who were expected to be stars 
entering the season.
Now, it’s true because of a 
redshirt freshman.
“Cam, if he started all the 
games,” Glasgow said, “I wouldn’t 
be surprised if he was up there 
instead of myself.”
