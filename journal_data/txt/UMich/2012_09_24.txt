Obama's lead
in polls means
state sees fewer
presidential spots
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
Though many television
viewers in Michigan have
grown irate by the inundation
of campaign advertisements
leading up to Election Day,
they may have noticed that a
decreasing number of them are
for the two presidential candi-
dates.
Experts said the decision
among campaign organizations
affiliated with the candidates
to not spend money on political
ads within the state signifies
that Michigan is not a swing
state. Still, viewers are sure to
get their dose of political ads,
as supporters and opponents
of the state's six ballot initia-
tives have been quick to fill the
Iairwaves that would otherwise
have been dominated by presi-
dential campaign efforts.
Nicholas Valentino, a pro-
fessor of political science and
a political communication
expert, said that while ads are
by no means the greatest deter-

minant of votes, they do often
have the ability to influence up
to 1-2 percent of the electorate.
"The biggest way in which
advertisements can influence
the vote is actually when one
candidate runs out of money in
a state and stops spending, and
the other one maintains a pres-
ence," Valentino said. "It's that
persistent visibility in the state
that's important and that ads
can really help with."
The Michi-
gan Campaign
Finance Net-
work, nonpar-
tisan groups
that track
campaign spending, reported
that pro-Romney groups, par-
ticularly the political action
committees Restore our Future
and American Crossroads,
spent $10.9 million on politi-
cal advertisements in the state
prior to Sept. 6. Since then,
those organizations and the
Romney campaign have dis-
continued their television ads
in Michigan in an effort to
focus attention and resources
on other key states as Obama
continues to grow his lead in
polling.
On Sunday, Obama was lead-
ing Romney 52 percent to 44
percent among likely voters in

Building a Better
Michigan aims to
improve campus
facilities
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
In addition to the Universi-
ty's ongoing efforts to renovate
its residence halls, one student
group has big plans for further
modernization of student facili-
ties on campus.
Building a Better Michigan, a
student advisory group in its sec-
ond year of operation, is working
to fund renovations and upgrades
for University buildings most
frequented by students. E. Roys-
ter Harper, the University's vice
president for student affairs, said
she is working actively with the
student group to raise awareness
about the campaign.
"We really just have to reno-
vate the facilities," Harper said.
"We just want to make sure we
get it right."
The group would like to see
renovations occur in three phas-

es, beginning with the Central
Campus Recreational. Build-
ing, the Michigan Union and
the North Campus Recreational
Building. Inthe second phase, the
group envisions changes to the
Intramural Sports Building and
the Michigan League. Finally,
the third phase involves replac-
ing Pierpont Commons with a
union and recreational sports
facility, according to LSA senior
Caroline Canning, the president
of LSA Student Government and
the co-chair of Building a Better
Michigan.
Each phase will require an
individual vote and approval
by the University's Board of
Regents. According to Canning,
the group would like to receive
the board's approval by the end
of the year for a student fee that
will help fund phase one.
Harper said improvements to
the athletic compounds and the
unions are necessary, because
each facility attracts different,
but equally large, groups of stu-
dents.

in recreational sports and some
students are really active in the

Amid a slow sprinkle of

strumming emanated from a
corner of the Diag Friday eve-
ning in support of Troy Davis,
a Georgia man many believe
was wrongly executed last
year after being convicted of
murdering a police officer.
The guitar piece opened
a vigil, attended by about 25
students, to commemorate the
execution of Davis on Sept.
21, 2011, and honor him for

becoming a symbol for fight-
ing injustice within the legal
system.
Davis was convicted of
murdering Burger King secu-

who was stopping an assault
in a nearby parking loton Aug.
19, 1989. Davis was sentenced
to execution in August 1991,

Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi speaks to reporters during a joint news conference in July with Tunisian President
Moncef Marzouki, unseen, at the Presidential palace in Cairo, Egypt.
Egypt's president wants to
distance country from U.S

Morsi tells NYT
that Egypt will be
more independent
CAIRO (AP) - On the eve of
his first visit to the United States
as Egypt's president, Islamist
Mohammed Morsi said he will
demonstrate more independence
from the U.S. in decision-mak-
ing than his predecessor Hosni
Mubarak and told Washington
not to expect Egypt to live by its
rules.
Morsi sent that message in
an interview with the New York
Times after a wave of violence
erupted across the Muslim world
over an amateur film produced in
the U.S. that was deemed offen-
sive to Islam and its prophet
Muhammed. The film raised
news tensions between Washing-
ton and Egypt.
Morsi criticized U.S. dealings
with the Arab world, saying it is
not possible to judge Egyptian
behavior and decision-making by
American cultural standards. He
said Washington earned ill will in
the region in the past by backing
dictators and taking"avery clear"
biased approach against the Pal-
estinians and for Israel.

"Successive American admin-
istrations essentially purchased
with American taxpayer money
the dislike,ifnotthehatred, of the
peoples of the region," he told the
paper in the interview published
late Saturday, drawing a clear dis-
tinction between the American
government and the American
people. Those administrations
"have taken a very clear biased
approach against something that
(has) very strong emotional ties to
the people of the region that is the
issue of Palestine."
He stressed that unlike his
predecessor, Mubarak, he will
behave "according to the Egyp-
tian people's choice and will,
nothingelse."
But with an Islamist presi-
dent at the helm of the Arab
world's most populous country,
there are already differences and
changes of focus. Morsi has been
expected to distance himself
from what many Egyptians saw
as Mubarak's compliance with
Washington's agenda in the Mid-
dle East, especially because his
Muslim Brotherhood group has
been a vocal critic of U.S. policy
in the region and in the Muslim
world.
In the interview, Morsi dis-
missed criticism that he respond-

ed too slowly when protesters
managed to scale the walls of the
heavily fortified U.S. Embassy in
Cairo on Sept. 11. The demonstra-
tors replaced the American flag
with a banner carrying the Islam-
ic declaration of faith.
While he praised President
Barack Obama for moving "deci-
sively and quickly" to support
Arab Spring uprisings against
longtime authoritarian leaders,
he said Arabs like Americans
want to live "free in their own
land, according to their customs
and values, in a fair and demo-
cratic fashion."
He has strongly criticized the
Syria regime for violently repress-
ing the uprising there, tried to
warm relations with the Palestin-
ians, and has dealt with tensions
between the Middle East and the
West over the anti-Islam film.
The Times asked Morsi if the
U.S. was an ally, to which he
replied with a laugh by saying:
"That depends on your definition
of ally."
But he quickly followed by
saying he wants a real friendship
with the U.S.
"I think what I am trying
seriously (is to) look into the
future and to see that we are real
friends."

Philadelphia man
confirms he was an
SS guard
BERLIN (AP) - Germany has
launched a war crimes investiga-
tion against an 87-year-old Phila-
delphia man it accuses of serving
as an SS guard at the Auschwitz
death camp, The Associated
Press has learned, follow-
ing years of failed U.S. Justice
Department efforts to have the
man stripped of his American
citizenship and deported.
Johann "Hans" Breyer, a
retired toolmaker, admits he was
a guard at Auschwitz during
World War II, but told the AP
he was stationed outside the
facility and had nothing to do
with the wholesale slaughter of
some 1.5 million Jews and oth-
ers behind the gates.
The special German office
that investigates Nazi war
crimes has recommended
that prosecutors charge him
with accessory to murder and
extradite him to Germany for
trial on suspicion of involve-
ment in the killing of at least
344,000 Jews at the Aus-
chwitz-Birkenau death camp
in occupied Poland.
The AP also has obtained
documents that raise doubts
about Breyer's testimony about
the timing of his departure
from Auschwitz.
Experts estimate that at
least 80 former camp guards
or others who would fall into
the same category are likely
still alive today, almost 70 years
after the end of the war.
Authorities in the Bavar-
ian town of Weiden, who have
jurisdiction, are currently try-
ing to determine if the evidence
is sufficient for prosecution.
Breyer acknowledged in an
interview in his modest row
house in northeastern Phila-
delphia that he was in the
Waffen SS at Auschwitz but
that he never served at the
part of the camp responsible
for the extermination of Jews.
He said he was aware of
what was going on inside the
death camp, but did not wit-
ness it himself. "We could

only see the outside, the gates,"
he said.
For more than a decade, the
Justice Department waged court
battles to try to have Breyer
deported. They largely revolved
around whether Breyer had lied
about his Nazi past in applying
for immigration or whether he
could have citizenship through
his American-born mother. That
legal saga ended in 2003, with a
ruling that allowed him to stay in
the United States, mainly on the
grounds that he had joined the
SS as a minor and could therefore
not be held legally responsible
for participation in it.
Breyer testified in U.S. court

that he served as a perimeter
guard at Auschwitz I, which
was largely for prisoners used
as slave laborers, though it als
had a makeshift gas chamber
used early in the war; it was also
the camp where SS doctor Josef
Mengele carried out sadistic
experiments on inmates.
But he denied ever serving in
Auschwitz II, better known as
Auschwitz-Birkenau, the death
camp area where the bulk of the
people were killed. He also said
he deserted in August, 1944 and
never returned to the camp,
though eventually rejoined his
unit fighting outside Berlin in
the final weeks of the war.

DETROIT
Detroit in line to
set world record
for hop scotch
 Several groups set out to cre-
ate the world's largest hopscotch
course in the city on Saturday.
They invited artists, communi-
ty leaders, children, families and
businesses to come out and chalk
up 22,720 feet worth of Detroit's
sidewalks. That's a 4.2-mile
course, which would be good for a
new world record. Mlive.com says
the results are being submitted to
recoredsetter.com for validation.
Guinness World Records says
the longest hopscotch game until
now was 3.4 miles set last year in
Eden Mills, Ontario.
Organizers say their idea is to
bring people together in the city
and encourage community, play,
imagination and the creative use
of design.

Man jumps in cage
with Siberian tiger,
accomplishes goal
Before his now-infamous tan-

Villalobos adorned his Facebook
page with New Age odes to Moth-
er Earth and affirmations like,
"Be love and fearless."
Police said Saturday that Vil-
lalobos had told detectives that it
was without fear that, he leaped
from an elevated train into the
animal's den. His reason, they
said, was that "he wanted to be
one with the tiger."
Villalobos also recounted how,
after he landed on all fours, the
400-pound beast attacked him
and dragged around by his foot,
said New York Police Department
spokesman Paul Browne. Despite
serious injuries, he claimed he
was able to get his wish and pet
the tiger - a male Siberian named
Bashuta - before his rescue, the
spokesman added.

HILLSBORO, Ore.
Attempted

burgalar found
sleeping on floor
Sheriff's deputies respond-
ing to a burglary call say they
found a 20-year-old man asleep
on the kitchen floor of a home in
Oregon.
The Washington County sher-
iff's office says the homeowner
discovered the sleeping stranger
early Friday. Deputies arrived to
find Cristian Villarreal-Castillo,
who had in his pockets small
electronic devices believed to be
stolen from unlocked vehicles.
Deputies say many items in
the home in the Rock Creek
neighborhood of Hillsboro had
been ransacked in an appar-
ent attempt to find valuables.
They believe Villarreal-Castillo
entered the home through an
unlocked door and was in the
process of gathering items when
he fell asleep.
He is charged with burglary,
attempted theft, trespassing
and criminal mischief. Investi-
gators also linked him to a bur-
glary that happened a few hours
before his arrest.

found at DC zoo
WASHINGTON (AP) -
The giant panda cub born a
week ago at the National Zoo
in Washington died Sunday
morning, saddening zoo offi-
cials and visitors who had her-
alded its unexpected arrival.
The 4-ounce cub, about the
size of a stick of butter, showed
no obvious signs of distress and
made its final recorded noise
shortly before 9 a.m. Sunday,
zoo officials said at a news con-
ference.
The cub's mother, Mei
Xiang, then made an unusual
honking sound at 9:17 a.m. that
her keepers interpreted as a
distress call, and she moved
away from where she had been
nesting with the cub. About
an hour later, one keeper dis-
tracted her with honey water
while another used an instru-
ment similar to a lacrosse stick
to pick up the cub.
The cub, whose gender
could not be determined
externally, was not breathing
and its heart had stopped. A
veterinarian attempted CPR
before it was pronounced dead
at 10:28 a.m.
"This is devastating for
all of us here," National Zoo
director Dennis Kelly said at
a news conference. "It's hard
to describe how much passion
and energy and thought and
care has gone into this."
Four American zoos have
pandas, but Washington's pan-

das are treated like royalty.
The zoo was given its first set
of pandas in 1972 as a gift from
China to commemorate Presi-
dent Richard Nixon's historic
visit to the country.
Mei Xiang's first cub, Ta;
Shan, born in 2005, enjoyed
enormous popularity before he
was returned to China in 2010.
The new cub, born Sept. 16,
had been a surprise at the zoo.
Fourteen-year-old Mei Xiang
had five failed pregnancies
before giving birth.
Panda mothers are about
1,000 times heavier than their
cubs, and sometimes they acci-
dentally crush them. On any
given day in the first two weeks
of life, cubs have a mortality
rate of 17 to 18 percent, zoo offi-
cials said.
A necropsy was being con-
ducted to determine the cause
of death, and preliminary find-
ings were expected Monday,
said Suzan Murray, the zoo's
chief veterinarian. The cub
showed no external signs of
trauma, she said.
As they did after Tai Shan
was born, keepers had been
leaving Mei Xiang alone with
her offspring, monitoring her
on video feeds that were also
streamed on the zoo's website.
Mei Xiang was resting com-
fortably after the cub's death,
officials said.
The cub had not yet been
named in accordance with
Chinese tradition - it was to
receive a name after 100 days
on Dec. 24. Had the cub sur-
vived until then, it would have
been roughly the size of a loaf
of bread and weighed around
10 pounds. It will not be named
posthumously, Kelly said.

Focus on Holder betrays real issues of 'Furious'
n October 2011, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives made headlines in newspapers all over the country
when illegal American firearms - which had been allowed by
U.S. officials to cross the U.S.-Mexico border - were first implicated
in the December 2010 death of U.S. border patrol agent Brian Terry.
Initially, the public and certain members of Congress began to blame
President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, until
recent reports by the Justice Department revealed that President
Obama and Holder weren't connected to the operation. Despite these
findings, Republicans have continued to use this event for political
purposes along the campaign trail. They should stop trying to politi-
cize this tragedy in the interest of figuring out the real actors and
preventing the reoccurrence of such a misuse of governance.

Beginning in 2006, the ATF conducted
various sting operations to track and destroy
major drug cartels in Mexico. However, it
was not until late 2011 when it was formally
recognized that the ATF was responsible for
guns that had appeared at the scenes of this
operation, known as Fast and Furious. In
this operation, the ATF allowed about 2,000
"potentially illegal firearms" to tross the
Mexican border. The aftermath of the failed
operation culminated in the first instance in
American history in which Congress held an
Attorney General in contempt.
According to last week's reports from the
Justice Department, Holder and President
Obama did not have any prior knowledge of
Operation Fast and Furious until the details
of the fiasco were made public in February
2011. Instead of pointing fingers at each other
and accusing "murder," Congress should be
looking for the real culprits behind this scan-
dal. Implicating one another in the media and
turning it into a election issue has made the
situation worse, particularly in light of vot-
ers's waning faith in the Congress.
Sting operations in which illegal materi-
als are allowed to leave government hands
are questionable enough. However, Opera-

tion Fast and Furious is even more obscene
because the "traced" weapons could only be
recovered at the scene of a crime. This sort
of retroactive investigative strategy implies
a troubling lack of concern for public welfare.
When the scandal first broke, it was hard to
separate fact from fiction. For example, it took
about four months for the Justice Depart-
ment to determine that President Obama and
Holder weren't involved. On Wednesday, the
independent inspector general of the Justice
Department released a report that may result
in the punishment ofuip to 14 government offi-
cials. It's a start, but further measures must
be taken to ensure that everyone involved in
the mismanagement of Fast and Furious is
answers for their mistakes.
While neither President Obama nor Attor-
ney General Holder were involved in
the scandal, it is time for the government to
ensure the use of efficient safety protocol
in all future covert operations. This was a
damaging blow to our government's credibil-
ity, and it's imperative that the government
establishes a legal precedent to avoid needless
deaths in the future. In the words of Holder,
"the use of this misguided tactic is inex-
cusable, and it must never happen again."

ZACHERY MCKINNON I
Make Mond
Last month, Ann Arbor Public Schools
joined dozens of other school districts, hospi-
tals and universities in implementing "Meat-
less Monday" in their cafeterias as part of an
initiative to improve student health and envi-
ronmental sustainability. I want to urge din-
ing services at the University to follow suit by
adding more meat-free options and empha-
sizing them on Mondays.
It's clear that the University recognizes the
importance of environmental sustainability
with its programs to reduce waste, support'
local farms and compost, but if we want to
seriously address sustainability on campus,
we need to look at reducing meat consump-
tion. Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the chair of the
United Nation's climate change panel, argues
in a 2008 article from The Guardian that in
terms of having an immediate impact on the
environment, meat reduction "clearly is the
most attractive opportunity" and suggests
that we "give up meat for one day [per week]
initially, and decrease it from there." Accord-
ing to a 2008 study from Carnegie Mellon
University, going without meat and dairy just
one day a week reduces more greenhouse gas
emissions than eating locally the entire year.
Meatless Monday can also help with weight
loss and longevity. After recently goingvegan,
Bill Clinton said he lost 24 pounds and has
never felt better. A study from the Harvard
School of Public Health this year found that
when people replace meat with healthy plant

ays meatless
proteins, including beans, other legumes and
nuts, their chances of mortality can decrease.
by as much as 11 percent.
Finally, if every American participated in
Meatless Monday, more than a billion fewer
land animals would be subjected to the inhu-
mane conditions of factory farms each year.
To put that into perspective, if every Uni-
versity of Michigan student participated in
Meatless Monday, each year 140,000 fewer
land animals would be factory farmed.
By now, most of my friends and classmates
know that many animals raised for food do
not live on open pastures or die of old age. The
vast majority of farm animals today live on fac-
tory farms, where they are crammed by the
thousands into large, ammonia-ridden sheds
with no fresh air or sunlight, until the day of
their slaughterhouse deaths. Mother pigs are
crammed into cages so small they can't even
turn around and egg-laying hens are given less
space than the screen of an iPad to live on for
their entire lives.
Each time we sit down to eat, we yield enor-
mous power to change the world to our greedy
stomachs. Meatless Monday is a simple switch
that can have a profound impact on our ani-
mals, health and planet. I hope my fellow stu-
dents and the University will join me and Ann
Arbor Public School students by participating
in Meatless Monday on campus and at home.

I imagine it was an otherwise
average day in Romneyville this
past Monday until a campaign aide,
phone placed delicately on a gold
platter strapped across his back,
frantically crawled toward the Mitt
Man himself. Tim Pawlenty was on
the line.
"Mitt," Pawlenty said. "Do you
remember that fundraiser you had
awhile back in Boca Raton? The one
that was $50,000 a plate?"
"Were we having a clearance sale
or something?" Mitt chortled with
self-satisfaction.
"Mitt, I assure you this is no
laughing matter. Do the words '47
percent' mean anything to you?"
Romney thought for a minute. As
the realization of his gaffe dawned
upon him, he lowered his head into
his hands.
"Goddammit."
"I'm out, Mitt. Good luck with
the rest of your year."
Again, I imagine. That's what
it seemed like anyway, when the
Republican presidential nominee
called a shotgun press conference
on Sept. 17 to announce that he
hadn't really meant to denounce
47 percent of the nation as "depen-
dent" or "entitled" during a closed-
door luncheon for 30 of his most
lucrative donors. The question, he
claimed, was taken out of context.
No, there definitely hadn't been
enough context when he said that
"my job is to not worry about those
people." Perhaps, had we really
known whatwas going on, we
would've seen that he was merely
referring to the sorry state of the

Boston Red Sox. C'mon guys, it's an
election year. He doesn't have time
to take a stance on Bobby V!
All kidding aside though, the guy
looked like he was going to have a
heart attack on that podium during
his quasi-apology. And truthfully,
I can't blame him. Even when you
ignore the fact that the price of get-
ting a seat at that lunch was higher
than the annual income of the aver-
age American, Romney managed to
make himself look more hopelessly
out of touch with this nation than
ever. "There are 47 percent ... who
are dependent upon government,
who believe they are victims ... who
believe they are entitled to health-
care, to food, to housing, to you
name it," Romney said. Regardless
of what his policies reflect, isn't it a
little disconcerting that the poten-
tial leader of our nation doesn't
seem to care about whether his fel-
low Americans are sick, homeless
or hungry? Mitt, I've got another
question too: does education fall
into that "you-name-it" category?
Am I considered one of those "enti-
tled" 47 percenters who will never
embrace my personal responsibili-
ties because of the financial aid I
receive every year that helps me
attend this university?
In his defense, Romney made sure
to counter back to these criticisms
by saying during his press confer-
ence: "I want to help all Americans,
all Americans, have a bright and
prosperous future." Yet, should his
campaign prove successful, I still
can't help but feel that the concerns
of America's less well-to-do citizens

will be flicked away like a speck of
dirt on one of his immaculately man-
icured fingernails.
It's been abundantly clear
throughout his campaign that
Romney is in dire need of a reality
check. Here's a quick and easy one:
Mitt, once upon a time, your father
was dependent on the government.
Yes, George Romney, the former
governor of Michigan, was also, in
fact, a former recipient of welfare
himself. Isn't it just adorable when
kids grow up and completely forget
about their-roots?
Despite his family history, Rom- 4
ney has never made his allianceswith
high society a secret, with this latest
incident only serving as evidence of
how deeply ingrained he is into the
fabric of the American upper-crust.
Have you ever wondered what goes
on during all those hush-hush meet- 4
ings in private boardrooms? Well,
we just saw it, and it wasn't pretty.
Honestly, the most shocking thing
about this entire affair was that the
Monopoly man wasn't in attendance.
Of course, Romney has every
right to yuk it up and rub elbows
with the financial elite as much as
he'd like. Certainly after his years
as a governor and a successful busi-
nessman, he's earned it. Plus, I'm
sure that $50 can buy you a pretty
tasty filet mignon. Come Election
Day, though, I hope that the Ameri-
can citizens will do the right thing:
show him that 47 percent is sup-
posed to count for a whole lot more
than 1 percent does.

The poetry
behind those
three little words

Mastering introsuection

T here's never a worse
time to fall in love than
whenever you do. You
become painfully aware of all
your shortcomings, all the times
you don't
make your
bed, comb
your hair or
check your
teeth for
food. It's a
messy, weird
ride.
Things ANNA
only get SADOVSKAYA
weirder the
longer you
stay on: All of a sudden, it might
feel strange to have a Tuesday
night to yourself. A text that
reads "Hey dood" makes you
happy. Certain songs make you
sigh. You're vaguely crazy and
you know it - and the weirdest
part is, almost everyone wants
their slice of this insane cake,
and to eat it too.
No one really knows what's
going on, ever. Falling in love is
a lot like a rowdy game of "red
light, green light" that starts
and stops as unexpectedly and
sloppily as a four-year-old on a
sugar high.
"I just. She's just so ... I mean
...You know?"
Yeah man, the thing is, I do
know. But she does not. Put-
ting feelings into words comes
as naturally as engineering the
Mars rover landing, for some.
And for whatever reason, "I like
you 'cause you're like ... pretty,"
isn't romantic enough. And it
should be - you skipped going
to Meijer so you could spend
r 20 extra minutes with her. You
sacrificed bacon for her. You love
her.
Chivalry might be dead,
but you better hope that you
can Frankenstein a bit of it for
the sake of your relationship.
Where's the poetry? If Univer-
sity relationships were albums,
most would be bumpingto Lil'
Wayne's lyrics. Highly quixotic.
"I wish he'd just tell me how
he feels," say all girls every-
where. But what do they know?
They're equally lost when it
comes to working out how they
feel - just much more vocal
about the process. And where
there are girls loudly proclaim-
ing their indecisive decisions
every hour, there are lost boys
meandering through the battle-
field of love.
There's no foolproof plan to
follow. There's no "Say This To
Make Her Happy" book - but,
thankfully, there's poetry.

Poets are wounded souls, peo-
ple that experience feelings on
another level: Everything makes
just enough sense to be beautiful
and not enough to be painless.
So rather than drive themselves
'crazy with emotion, they've let it
out in the form of poetry, yours
to quote and take hints from.
Shakespeare wrote 154 son-
nets. William Butler Yeats
meditated on love and loss.
John Keats was one of the main
romantic poets of his time. All
are waiting for you in the near-
est library.
"I am not artsy" is no longer
an excuse. A long time ago,
someone somewhere decided
that feelings and art go hand-
in-hand, and that unless you're
a starving-artist hipster, it was
weird to express yourself in an
artful way. Painting the person
you love a picture? Cute when
you're eight, a bit strange at 18.
"Roses are red, violets are blue,
it's your birthday, I like you,"
doesn't quite make the cut for
meaningful irerse.
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
'Sup dude?
Let's hang out.
It's not about reinventing
yourself into the next e. e. Cum-
mings - it's about reading
something profoundly relat-
able. Mussed up musings aside,
relationships center on being in
touch with the emotional half
of things, and expressing that
is difficult when you're unsure
of how you feel. Read poetry to
connect with something insight-
ful, to witness sentiment playing
out properly, to finally see your
angst put to words.
If there ever comes a time
when it's appropriate to say,
"hut, soft! What light through
yonder window breaks," take
it. Use it. Nail that line and feel
proud to have used Shakespeare
to your advantage. But if there's
ever a time you start fearing for
your lexicon and stop under-
standing how to explain a par-
ticular thought, crack open "The
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"
and settle down for some light,
cathartic reading.

Anderson was able to force his
audience into the depraved mind
of a maniac.
And as we sat there and
watched, Anderson slowly suf-
focated us with the tension and
unease he quietly used to weave
together his masterpiece. In
short, it was the type of filmmak-
ing that changes one's perception
of what a movie can do. Ander-
son's latest film, "The Master,"
never reaches the heights he was
able to achieve in "Blood." It is in
most senses a weaker film, but
nevertheless still an amazing
movie that has the capability to
engross and challenge a patient
audience.
The movie opens on a shot of
Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoe-
nix, "Gladiator") pretending to
have sex with a sand sculpture

"Oh, we know soylent green is peopleJoin us?

on a military base in post-WWII
Guam. After a few psychiatric
evaluations, it's made clear that
Quell is a very disturbed indi-
vidual battling with alcoholism
- not even the most significant of
his many self-destructive tenden-
cies. As Quell struggles to come to
terms with the normality of life
after living in a state of constant
war, he begins making his own
alcohol - by combining paint
thinner with hard liquor.
Ultimately, he catches the
interest of Lancaster Dodd (Phil-
lip Seymour Hoffman, "Mon-
eyball"), a charismatic and
magnetically compelling indi-
vidual who claims to know the
secret to curing Quell of his des-
perate dependence on destruc-
tive behavior. Dodd peddles his
"process" to a cult of followers
only identified as "The Cause."
As the film gradually hones in on

the volatile relationship between
Quell and Dodd, Anderson lets go
of the reins and allows the actors
to dictate the flow of the movie.
It's also at this point that "The
Master" becomes probably the
best movie released so far this
year. Mitch like "There Will Be
Blood" was Daniel Day-Lewis's
film, "The Master" belongs to
Phoenix and Seymour Hoffman.
The performances they deliver
are nothing short of extraordi-
nary and serve as perfect foils
to each other. On the one hand,
there's Phoenix's visceral, car-
nally violent embodiment of a
man tormented by his own inept-
itudes. At its core, the rawness
that Phoenix brings to his por-
trayal of Freddie Quell gives him
the emotional composure of a
parentless child or caged animal.
On the other end of the spec-
trum is Lancaster Dodd, a man so

in love with the idea of being in
absolute control that he attempts
to use Quell as proof that his
"process" is valid. When things
quickly get out of hand, Dodd's
fractured personality surfaces
and Seymour Hoffman subtly
molds it in a way that incites deep
feelings of self-doubt in anyone
watching.
That ability to force audience
members to look inward and
question the self is classic Paul
Thomas Anderson, who has made
a career out of doing character
studies of deeply troubled men.
Even if it isn't a masterpiece, it
has what we've come to expect
from Anderson - a deep and
thoroughly fleshed-out vision
that grips and rattles our core
until we see things a little dif-
ferently. And when all's said and
done, that's what meaningful cin-
ema is really about.

Don't judge 'Dredd' by
uninspired original

"No, I'm not Julia Roberts."V
Gere delivers deceit

Plot twists in
'Arbitrage' keep
viewers engaged
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
In the aftermath of the
financial crisis, Hollywood
has produced a string of Wall
Street-themed
thrillers that
document the
systemic melt- Arbitrage
down and the
narcissism of At the State
the bankers
who caused Lionsgate
it. As another
name on a fairly accomplished
list, "Arbitrage" had a lot to do to
distinguish itself. But it manages
to justify its existence with rela-
tive finesse and wit. This film is
a financial-thriller-meets-mur-
der-mystery that captivates its
audience, even if it doesn't quite
meet the full potential of either
mystery or thriller.
To picture Richard Gere ("The
Double") playing a leading busi-
ness tycoon while not romancing
Julia Roberts is a little strange
at first. But it's refreshing to see
him in something other than a
romantic comedy. Gere plays
Robert Miller, a hedge fund
magnate whose thriving compa-

ny is on the verge of going broke
after a bad investment in copper
- the profits from his business
can't make it to America. The
details of this 'arbitrage' are too
economically complex for this
writer to elaborate, but luckily
one doesn't need to be an eco-
nomics major to enjoy the film.
Miller decides to replace the
lost money with his friend's - but
only long enough to sell his com-
pany to a hesitant competitor. But
he hasn't seen the worst of it yet.
Miller unexpectedly gets into
an accident, killing the woman
he's having an affair with, Julie
(Laetitia Casta, "War of the But-
tons"). He can't call the cops for
fear of exposing his affair and
ending the pending sale of his
company. Instead, he has to con-
struct a string of lies to make sure
he's not associated with the acci-
dent, making Julie's death seem
like a homicide instead of invol-
untary manslaughter.
What follows is a smart, quick
thriller about a man who's try-
ing to get himself and his fam-
ily out of both financial and
criminal crisis. The lies he has
to construct are complex and
unpredictable, and one has to
credit first-time director and
writer Nicholas Jarecki for his
bold script and enticing filming.
The fact that this movie keeps
the audience guessing is cause
alone for it to be commended.

And then there's the film's
almost over-qualified cast.
Susan Sarandon ("Robot and
Frank") as Robert's wife Ellen
is too good for her part, but her
talent is crucial to making this
film more than just a financial
thriller. Her fear and frustration
at Robert's lies make this movie
more endearing than its purely
money-minded counterparts.
Tim Roth ("The Incred-
ible Hulk") as Detective Bryer
is equally charming in his role.
And Gere is, well, Gere, but
better. Jarecki endows his lead
with a character simultaneously
flawed, complex and powerful -
and Gere delivers.
The only problem with this
film is that it doesn't live up to
everything it promises. It's not
fast-paced enough to be a thriller,
it's not as unexpected or twist-
ridden as a mystery and, thank-
fully, it's not dry enough to be a
documentary. And that leaves it
on the cusp of everything, but not
quite the master of any one thing.
But that's far from saying that
it's not entertaining or interest-
ing. "Arbitrage" has a plot that
will keep you guessing, and a
cast that delivers some pow-
erhouse performances. And of
course, there's the charm of
watching Gere's dimpled face
play a part worthy of his talents
in a film that's neither a romance
nor a comedy.

Remaking
movies is often
a fruitless attempt - the prod-
uct usually unsatisfying. Now,
remaking a film that already
sucks - well, that's ballsy. But
not this time. This time, pure guts
(literally) have paid off: "Dredd"
is bloody, funny and ferocious.
In a world laid to waste by
nuclearwarfare,onecityremains:
Mega-City One, a vast metropolis
of 800 million inhabitants, where
over 17,000 crimes are reported
daily.To keep a relative amount
of order in the city, the police
department's elite units, Judges,
are proclaimed judge, jury and
executioner. Its most reputed
operative, Judge Dredd (Karl
Urban, "Star Trek") and a recruit
named Cassandra Anderson
(Olivia Thirlby, "Being Flynn")
investigate a triple homicide in a
200-story slum tower block. But
things take a turn for the worst
and their assignment explodes
into an all-out war against a drug
clan led by a fearsome kingpin
named Ma-Ma (Lena Headey,
"Game of Thrones").
There's nothing novel about
the story. You could call it "Blade
Runner" meets "The Raid:
Redemption." Yet "Dredd" is
exhilarating. The action is snappy
and brutal. Tracheas get crushed,
people get skinned, there are hal-
lucinogenic drugs, brain matter,
images of violent sex - on a scale
of one to ten on the ultra-violence
meter, "Dredd" gets a Quentin
Tarantino. This remake is unusu-
ally unapologetic.
And in that, it's'glorious. Final-
ly, here's a film that knows how to
do shoot-em-ups. Director Pete

Michigan, according to a CNN/
ORC poll.
Those numbers were met with
no response from the Obama
campaign or pro-Obama inter-
est groups, who have spent no
money on TV advertising within
Michigan to date. Robinson said if
viewers do see presidential adver-
tisements at this time, they would
be on national cable networks or
major news channels.
Valentino said the lack of pres-
ence from both presidential cam-
paigns on the airwaves clearly
points to decrease in the competi-
tiveness of the race in Michigan.
"A better indication that Michi-
gan is competitive will be when
the Obama campaign spends
money, because right now they
don't feel a need to," Rich Robin-
son, executive director of MCFN,
said.
According to Robinson, Restore
our Future will go back to air-
ing pro-Romney ads for the next
few weeks, a move that he said he
believes is strategically smart.
Valentino said this careful dis-
tribution of nationwide advertise-
ments is part of a growing trend
to exclusively target voters in
important swing states such as
Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois, Florida
and Virginia.

unions," she said. "We're wanting
to make sure that the facilities are
good, the fields are good."
Though it will be challenging
to renovate all three of the athlet-
ic compounds and all three of the
unions, Harper said she believes
the University is capable of the
task.
"We're really trying to think
creatively," she said.
Canning said Building a Better
Michigan's efforts to add a small
fee to students' tuition, as a sup-

"Many Americans will see no
political ads whatsoever or very
few and other Americans will be
absolutely inundated, seeing more
than 10 per person, (or) 20 differ-
ent ads in the course of the last
several weeks of the campaign,"
Valentino said.
As of Sunday, neither the Obama
nor Romney campaigns had replied
to requests for comment.
Even with an increased reliance
on social media campaigning, as
well as door-to-door outreach,
Robinson estimates that approxi-
mately two-thirds of a campaign's
budget is typically spent on TV
advertising.
However, MCFN reported that
more than 70 percent of Romney's
advertising is sponsored by undis-
closed donors in the form of 501(c)
(4) corporations that, unlike PACs
and SuperPACs, do not disclose
their financial reports or donors.
Robinson said ads that discuss
the unsuitability of a candidate
rather than explicitlytelling view-
ers to vote for them are typically
funded by the 501(c)(4) corpora-
tions.
Advocates and opponents of
Proposition 3 in Michigan, which
would require all electric power
companies to provide 25 percent
of their services from renewable
resources by 2025, have raised
about $8.9 million, $6.2 million
of which is in opposition, accord-
ing to the National Institute on
plement to using University fund-
ing to pay for the renovations, is
critical to implementing the pro-
gram. She added that the club
received overwhelming support
in favor of the student fee when
it surveyed 5,000 students and
faculty last year, and if passed
among the regents, the fee would
be implemented in the next aca-
demic year.
Canning added that the club
has observed the amenities avail-
able at other schools and is hop-
ing to establish some of the more
popular services at the Univer-
sity.
"At other schools they have

Money in State Politics, a political
spending tracking group.
To date, the oppositional fund-
ing has come from the Clean
Affordable Renewable Energy for
Michigan Coalition, whose pri-
marily donors include DTE and
CMS Energy - the parent organi-
zation of Consumers Energy.
Robinson also noted that Prop-
osition 6, which would require
voter consent on new bridges and
tunnels between Michigan and
Canada, will continue to have a
large presence on statewide TV.
Robinson said the Moroun family
- of which Matty Moroun owns
the Ambassador Bridge linking
Detroit and Windsor - spent $10
million on TV ads promoting the
measure even before it was on the
ballot.
"They'll continue to spend
their half million (dollars) a week
right up until Election Day," Rob-
inson said.
Valentino predicted that Prop-
osition 2, which would protect
the right for unions to collec-
tively bargain, will get significant
airtime due to its controversial
nature.
Protect Our Jobs, the com-
mittee supporting the collective
bargaining ballot initiative, has
already raised $8,143,307with the
support of numerous Michigan
unions, according to MCFN. The
committee had spent $1,153,619 as
of July.

eatery in their gyms for after

also be more trainers and classes
available."
The group is holding a town
hall meeting on Monday from 7 to
8 p.m. in the Michigan League for
student's to voice their opinions,
which Canning said she hopes
students will take advantage of in
order to make suggestions.
"We get a ton of e-mails about
renovations and why buildings
around campus could be more
functional," she said. "But we
really need (student) support to
make that happen."

You tell yourself that was solid

fact that he just passed Chad

abysmal performances of his
college career. You scroll further

he also surpassed Henne's mark

Hash, an assistant professor of
emergency medicine, will facili-
tate a surveythat will be sent to a
random sample of 10,000 under-
graduate and graduate students,
where they will answer a series of
questions about eating habits.
"It would be great if we get
a really good response rate,"
Dooley-Hash said. "I know that
people get a lot of surveys and it's
hard to find time to fill them all
out but we're keeping our fingers
crossed that we get a fairly decent
response rate."
Lipson met Dooley-Hash after
starting her doctoral program in
the University's School of Edu-
cation. She expressed interest in
mental health of post-secondary
students with an emphasis on
eating and eating disorders, and
was later introduced to Dooley-
Hash after working with Daniel
Eisenberg, an assistant professor
of health management and policy.
When the duo discovered that
a $20,000 grant from the Global
Foundation For Eating Disorders
could help fund their research
initiatives, they decided to pro-
ceed together.

oping eating order prevention
methods as diets and eating
become increasingly popular in
today's culture.
"It seems important to look
at the whole campus and the
whole student body so that we
can design interventions and ...
prevention methods that apply
to everybody," Dooley-Hash said.
"What we're hoping to come out
of it is that we get a better idea of
how campus life influences peo-
ple as far as their eating behaviors
and body image and all of those
kind of things."
Lipson said U-SHAPE is dif-
ferent from previous studies
because the survey is campus
wide, as opposed to previous
studies that have been conduct-
ed within subgroups of campus,
such as sororities.
"We're casting the umbrella
much wider to say we're inter-
ested in a student's life that might
just be a little bit more difficult
because they have negative body
image and what can we try to do
help that student," Lipson said.
"So the questions were asking are
different because they're inter-
ested inthisbroader range of top-
ics related to eating, body image

the most common result.

In wake of rape comment,
Akin seeks to restore image

Congressmen
shows no sign of
dropping out as
deadline looms
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP)
- Written off by many in his
own party a mere month ago,
Republican Rep. Todd Akin has
been slowly rebuilding his Sen-
ate campaign after apologizing
for inflammatory remarks about
pregnancy and rape.
Now Akin is approaching a
critical week that could deter-
mine whether his re-emerging
campaign can gain enough
momentum to put Missouri
back in the battleground col-
umn as Republicans attempt to
win control of the Senate from
Democrats.
Tuesday is the deadline for
Akin to get a court order to
drop his challenge of Demo-
cratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.
But Akin says he won't do so.
Instead, Akin plans to ramp up
his campaign. He's holding a
fundraiser Monday with for-
mer Republican presidential
candidate Newt Gingrich. He's
addressing a potentially influ-
ential group of pastors Tuesday
morning. Then as the drop-out
clock ticks down, he's kick-
ing off a statewide bus tour for
his Senate bid that will include
venerable conservative activist
Phyllis Schlafly.
"I believe the state of the
campaign is looking better and
better," Akin said Friday after
engaging McCaskill in their
first debate and then rallying on
the Missouri Capitol lawn with
supporters of a newly formed
women-for-Akin coalition.
Akin has apologized repeat-
edly since a TV interview aired
Aug. 19 in which he suggested
that women's bodies have a nat-
ural defense against pregnancy
in cases of "legitimate rape."
He has repeatedly rejected calls
of top national Republicans -
including presidential candidate
Mitt Romney - to quit the race
so the state GOP committee
can appoint a replacement can-
didate. Yet some have doubted

Akin's resolve.
"There are a lot of donors who
have satlon the sidelines and are
waiting" for Tuesday's drop-out
deadline to pass, said Rick Tyler,
a former Gingrich aide who
joined Akin's campaign as part
of the re-building effort. "We
are tilling that hard soil now -
that is, reaching out to people
who could potentially give sig-
nificant amounts of dollars."
Come Tuesday, "those donors
are going to see that Todd's
going to be on the ballot," Tyler
adds.
Whether that triggers an
avalanche of money for Akin
remains one of the most impor-
tant questions facing his cam-
paign.
Akin already was starting
from behind against McCaskill
financially after spending all
but a few hundred thousand dol-
lars to win a contentious Aug.
7 Republican primary. After
his rape remark, Akin lost the
financial support of the Repub-
lican National Committee, the
Republican senators' political
committee and the deep-pock-
eted Crossroads group affiliated
with Republican strategist Karl
Rove. That zapped millions of
dollars of planned TV advertis-
ing.
Since then, Akin has raised
nearly $600,000 through a
small-dollar, online appeal
that has cast his candidacy as
an anti-establishment crusade
against both Republican Party
bosses and President Barack
Obama's administration. For-
mer Republican presidential
candidate Mike Huckabee has
aided the Internet fundraising
drive. But Gingrich's event Mon-
day - at $500 a person or $750
per couple - will be Akin's first
prominent headliner for a tradi-
tional fundraiser in at least five
weeks.
"This is an act of conscience
on my part - I didn't like seek-
ing a guy getting beaten up by
the power structure," Gingrich
said.
But Gingrich also is prag-
matic.
"If the Republicans are going
to win control of the Senate,
they need Missouri," said Gin-

grich, who led the Republican
takeover of the U.S. House in
1994.
Others also are considering
coming to Akin's aid, including
Sen. Jim DeMint, of South Caro-
lina, who has built the Senate
Conservatives Fund into a for-
midable fundraising organiza-
tion for its favored candidates.
Republicans need a net gain
of four seats in the November
elections to take control of the
Senate. But Republican-held
seats in Maine and Massachu-
setts are jeopardy, and losses
there would increase the num-
ber of seats the GOP must wrest
away from Democrats. Missouri
had been considered one of the
Republicans' best chances for a
pick-up until Akin's rape remark
undercut his campaign.
Regardless, Republican

paign.

Findings indicate
advancements
in olfactory
dysfunctions
By IAN DILLINGHAM
For the Daily
Researchers at the Universi-
ty's Medical School are one step
closer to understanding congen-
ital anosmia, a rare disease that
inhibits the sense of smell from
birth.
Jeffrey Martens, an associate
professor in the Department of
Pharmacology, and his research
team published a report in early
September documenting their
findings in increasing the nasal
function in rats suffering from a
strain of the disease that is fatal
in humans.
Though the breakthrough
won't apply specifically to
humans - since humans with
the strain don't survive beyond
birth - the findings have
broad implications for future
research on sensory dysfunc-
tions that result from ciliopathy,
a dysfunction of the cilia - small
hair-like structures that reside
on the cells of the nasal cavity
and are crucial for the brain's
detection and interpretation of
odors.
"We're very optimistic
because, not only was this one
of the first reports to treat anos-
mia, but this was, as far as we
know, one of the first reports to
actually treat a ciliopathy," Mar-
tens said.
Congenital anosmia is one
of many diseases that result
from complications with the

cilia. Odors dissolve in the nasal
mucus, which then bond to an
odor receptor on the cilia, which
sends a signal to the brain that
enables it to interpret the smell.
Ciliopathy can also impact
other organs of the body where
cilia exists, including the heart,
eyes and kidneys.
Martens said congenital
anosmia in humans is difficult
to study because of the lack of
known cases. He noted that two
to four million Americans have
anosmia or other olfactory dys-
functions, but it is unclear what
percentage of those cases is con-
genital.
Martens explained that lack
of clarity has to do with the dis-
ease going under-diagnosed or
unreported by patients.
"A lot of people don't know
that they can't smell, especially
if they haven't been able to smell
since birth or they don't go to
the doctor thinking it's a major
issue," he said.
The first author of the most
recent paper, Jeremy McIntyre,
a post-doctoral research fel-
low at the University Medical
School, has been working in
Martens's lab for about three
years. He said though the
research process can be ardu-
ous, reaching the point of publi-
cation makes the hard work pay
off.
"In the middle of research, it
can be painful at times," Mar-
tens said. "It can be alot of work.
It can be frustrating trying to
get the conditions right so that
you can answer the questions
that you need and work out all
the technicalities of doing these
experiments ... butthen you pub-
lish it, and everything up until
this point, for me, has been the

reward of publishing the paper."
For people battling the dis-
ease, Martens cautioned that
human applications are still
many years away.
"Our next step is to bet-
ter understand the system and
translate this into a potential
therapy for patients," Martens
said. "I think it's something
coming down the line but we're
not there yet."
Martens said a cure for
humans would require more
extensive research, which will
take time. However, he said he is
optimistic, calling the research
"an exciting first step," adding
that the research is reward-
ing because of the potential for
drastically improving the qual-
ity of life for those affected.
"When I got into this, I didn't
fully understand the impact it
has on people's lives and now it's
really changed my perspective
and I'm very excited because,
for the first time... I can see that
clear translational component,"
he said.
Martens said one of the most
satisfying outcomes of the
breakthrough is the response
he has received from patients
around the world who have vol-
unteered for clinical studies.
Martens lauded the support-
ive atmosphere of the University
in aiding their research endeav-
ors.
"We're just excited to be able
to do this work here at Michigan
and the environment here has
really provided us an oppor-
tunity to be able to make an
impact on the field," Martens
said. "There's tremendous sci-
ence going on throughout this
University and we're excited by
that."

Iraq executions on the rise,
raises concerns for civil rights

96 people killed in
2012 for allegedly
partaking in
terrorist activities
BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraq has
executed nearly 100 people so
far this year, a big increase over
previous years that has inten-
sified concern about whether
defendants are receiving fair
trials in a country where the
United States has spent billions
of dollars trying to reform the
judicial system after decades of
dictatorship.
The government says most
of the executed had been con-
victed of terrorism as bomb-
ings and shootings persist in
Iraq, albeit not at the levels at
the height of its conflict years

ago. However, international
observers worry that the legal
process is faulty and that some
trials are politically motivated
- including this month's death
sentence against Iraq's fugi-
tive Sunni vice president, Tariq
al-Hashemi, a longtime foe of,
Shiite Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki who was convicted
in absentia of running death
squads.
The executions in 2012 of at
least 96 people, all by hanging,
amount to more than a quarter
of all convicts who have been
put to death in the last eight
tumultuous years under lead-
ers who struggled to stabilize
a country at war after dictator
Saddam Hussein was ousted in
the U.S.-led war.
Christof Heyns, the U.N.
investigator on arbitrary exe-
cutions, described the govern-

ment-sanctioned executions
as "arbitrary killing" that is
"committed behind a smoke-
screen of flawed legal pro-
cesses." He warned that the "
continued lack of transparency
about the implementation of
the death penalty in Iraq, and
the country's recent record,
raise serious concerns about
the question of what to expect
in the future."
He made the remarks in a
statement in August after more
than two dozen people were
executed in one week.
Since 2005, Iraq's govern-
ment has executed 372 people,
including at least nine women
and number of foreigners
convicted of terror charges,
according to Justice Ministry
data. The number of foreigners
among those killed this year
was not available.

final game against Notre Dame, But for all the heroics he's
the night for Denard Robinson to displayed in the past against the

Irish, Denard Robinson finally
ran out of magic.
A series of missed opportuni-
ties and head-shaking mistakes -
none more prominent, nor more
crippling, than Robinson's own -
doomed No.18 Michigan in a 13-6
loss to No. 11 Notre Dame.
It's the first time the Wolver-
ines have fallen to the Fighting
Irish since 2008. That's also the
last time Notre Dame forced six
turnovers in a game, which is
likely no coincidence.

"This is the most disappoint-
ed I've been in myself in I don't
know how long," Robinson said.
"Twenty-two years I've been liv-
ing, that's the most disappointed
I've been in myself."
Beginning with the Wolver-
ines' third drive of the game,
those turnovers came on six
straight possessions for Michigan
(2-2). They explain how the team
could lose a game in which it out-
gained its opponent, 299 yards-
239 yards, and how it could look

so punchless while also moving
the ball fluidly at times.
Thanks to inspired play from
the defense - which looked much
improved from its rough perfor-
mances against Alabama and Air
Force - the Wolverines stayed in
it. Down 10-0 entering the fourth
quarter, they finally got on the
board via a 33-yard field goal from
redshirt junior Brendan Gibbons.
After Notre Dame (4-0) picked
up three points of its own, a
31-yarder from Gibbons got

Michigan within one score again
with 3:27 remaining in the game.
That was the end of the come-
back attempt, though - the Irish
picked up a first down after get-
ting the ball back and ran out the
clock from there.
"When yqu're in position to
make plays, you have to make
plays," saidMichigan coach Brady
Hoke. "You have to execute. We'll
learn a lot from this."

SOUTH BEND - Durrel Rob-
inson came back here on Satur-

little brother, Denard, began.
Now, at halftime, the magic had
eluded the younger Robinson,
but Durrel wasn't nervous.
That would come later.
Durrel sat with his girlfriend
Paris, Robinson's best friend
Steve and Robinson's girlfriend,
who requested anonymity.
Robinson had thrown four

interceptions on four straight
passes by halftime, but Durrel
had seen Robinson's rise, his
502 yards against Notre Dame
two years ago. "It made me feel
proud of him," he said.
The logic is inexplicable.
Except in Michigan, except
with Robinson. We had seen his
astonishing comeback against
the FightingIrish last year. Rob-
inson makes mistakes, plenty of
them, but he never breaks. Not
against Notre Dame.
Plus, Durrell had seen worse
halves from his little brother,

and so with a serious calm,
Durrel said this: "We don't lose
faith."
And why lose faith? They had
weathered the storm. The fun
part was about to begin.

The Notre Dame fan, dressed in

The Fighting Irish were pre-

"I'm serious," he said. "This

It's an easy model to follow:
The earlier and more frequently
a team shoots, the more likely it
is for them to score.
The No. 17 Michigan field
hockey team learned this as it fell
to No. 6 Penn State, 4-3, on Sun-
day after giving up three early
first-half goals in its Big Ten
opener.
After MICHIGAN 3

ing two
straight shutouts against Buck-
nell and then-No. 23 Fairfield on
Sept. 16 and 23, the Wolverines (
0-1 Big Ten, 6-4 overall) gave up
two quick goals to the Nittany
Lions' Ashtin Klinger.
"We just weren't playing our
game and sticking to our game
plan," said redshirt sophomore
defender Leslie Smith. "We were
letting them beat us to the ball."
Kleiger's first goal came off of
a cross by Hannah Allison that
Kleiger reflected with her stick
into the right corner of the net
at the 3:57 mark. It was the first
goal and the first shot on goal of
the game.
Before Michigan could get
off its first shot of the game, the
Nittany Lions (2-0, 10-2) scored
again - 10 minutes later. Klingler
added her second of the game
and seventh of the season after a
scramble in front of the net.
The goal resulted in a timeout
by the Wolverines that aimed to
calm the players down.
"We had to make a couple of
adjustments," said Michigan
coach Marcia Pankratz. "(The
timeout) worked really well and
we came out toe-to-toe with
them the rest of the way."
Three minutes after the time-
out, Michigan was finally able to
register its first shot - albeit not
on goal.
This brief moment of success
did not last for long, as Penn
State tallied its third goal of the
first half at the 18:40 mark off a

By NATE SELL
For the Daily
When the physical and men-
tal aspects of running finally
come together during a race, it's
a great moment for a competitive
runner.
That's exactly what happened
for sophomore Mason Ferlic,
who ran a career-best 24:28 for
the Michigan men's cross coun-
try team at the Panorama Farms
Invitational 8,000 meter race in
Earlysville, Va. on Saturday to
give the Wolverines a fourth-
place finish in a field of 10 teams.
"I knew I had it in me," Ferlic
said. "I was just looking for
smart decisions both mentally
and physically during the race,
and I really just took control
leading the chase pack after the
mile. I felt smooth, I felt strong,
and confident."
Ferlic's time earned him a
sixth-place finish - something
the second-year runner said he
was thrilled about.
"Coming down the straight-
away toward the finish line I
saw five guys in front of me and
I thought, 'Wow this was a good
race,' " Ferlic said. "I powered
home to the finish."
Junior Mark Beams finished
seconds behind Ferlic with a
time of 24:31, a career-best for
him as well.
"When I wanted to move for-
ward, I used the down hills and
flats to my advantage and just
relaxed on the up hills and just
picked guys off one at a time,"
said Beams. "I wasn't really con-
cerned with time while I was'
racing - really I was just com-
peting with theo guys around
me."
Ferlic and Beams stepped
up on a day where senior Dan
Lowry, a transfer from Brown
University, had some difficul-
ties, including a nasty fall about
two and a half miles into the

race. Lowry is typically the
team's fastest runner, but with
the miscues he was the third
Wolverine to cross the finish line
with a time of 24:34.
Junior Morsi Rayyan and
senior Zach Ornelas finished
with times 24:46 and 24:52,
respectively, wrapping up Mich-
igan's scoring five.
"We did some things really
well but we were a little bit slop-
py in our mid-race execution,"
said Michigan coach Alex Gibby.
The season is still very young,
though, and the course that
Michigan traveled to is no cake
walk. The Wolverines also had
to perform in 80-degree weather
- somethingno Michigan native
is accustomed to in late Septem-
ber.
The Michigan runners and
coaches emphasized that in pre-
paring for the race, nobody was
worried about times.
"It's all process related stuff,
we don't talk about specific
splits; it's more about feel, relat-
ing, and being prepared when
the time comes to make the right
decision," Gibby said.
"(Ferlic and Beams) were
rewarded for good decision-
making which is nice to see their
first time out."
Added Ferlic: "(We're) estab-
lishing a pattern for champion-
ship races when it really counts,
and I came out with a PR as just
kind of a benefit of the process."
This year's team has high
goals - in both the Big Ten and
nationally. When asked how he
feels about reaching these goals
after seeing the team run, Gibby
stayed positive.
"Certainly a lot better than
years past," he said. "We are
going to see definitive improve-
ment, but the question is how
much? We will be better than
last year but I think we are capa-
ble of being a very good national-
level team."

"We won the second half of

level of play by the end of the

Michigan was outshot 30-14

Due to the amount of shots
by the Nittany Lions, redshirt
junior Haley Jones was able to
record a career-high 14 saves -
nine of which came in the sec-

"Penn State is a really strong
team," Pankratz said. "I was
really proud of how hard we
fought."

zone, gained just five total yards
and never got inside the six-yard
line.
Prior to Saturday evening, the
Wolverines hadn't gone without a
red-zone touchdown since a loss
to Toledo on Oct. 11, 2008.
The numbers are as much a
testament to the Notre Dame
defense as they are an admonish-
ment of the Michigan offense.
The Fighting Irish have held
two Big Ten forces, Michigan
and Michigan State, to nine total
points and no touchdowns over
the last two weeks.
"When your defense is disap-
pointed that they kicked a field
goal and made it, that's when you
know, like, dang, we're going to
be good," said Notre Dame senior
linebacker Manti Teo, who inter-
cepted two passes in the game.
Entering the game, the Wol-
verines were a perfect 9-for-9
in red-zone conversions, with
eight touchdowns and a field goal
to their record. They were in a
similar position a year ago, when
the offense was 13-for-13 with 13
touchdowns through four games.
"Why did you say that?" offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges said
on Sept. 28, 2011 when asked
about the sterling red-zone effi-
ciency. "Doggone it. It's just like
that kiss of death, OK?"
OK. Except this time no one

best friend's varsity jacket.
The two girls wore "Shoelace"

This section is different.
Here, the hits sound louder. The
mistakes sting more.
From here, you can reach
out and touch the bass drums
in the Michigan band. When a
Notre Dame wide receiver was
open on the goal line, the par-
ents shouted and pointed, so
Thomas Gordon bumped over
and covered.
Robinson's supporters sat in
the fifth row, tucked in between
friends and family of freshman
linebacker James Ross III and
the family of fifth-year senior
J.T. Floyd.
Robinson's parents come to
games "very rarely, very rarely,"
J.T.'s father, James, said. Nor-
mally the Robinson clan gathers
in Robinson's grandmother's
house in Deerfield Beach, Fla.
around a television.
"Every Saturday," Durrel
said. "Everybody (goes). I can't
even tell you who don't go."
After Robinson's first three
interceptions, Durrel hardly
reacted. Remember Robinson's
three interceptions last year?
His miserable first half?
After his third and fourth
interceptions, Durrel mumbled
for just an instant, but it was out
of frustration more than worry.
"One thing about him,
though, he ain't never gonna
give up," Durrel said.
Now, in the third quarter,
Robinson was driving again
when he fumbled on the Notre
Dame 11-yard line.
This time, Durrel swore to

Steve quietly. Paris put her
hands over her mouth. Robin-
son's girlfriend put her hands
over her head as in disbelief.
"It's a heart attack," Paris
said. "I feel like I'm having a
heart attack."
But this was all part of the
Robinson script, and by the end
of the quarter, the poise was
back.
"I'm good," Durrel said. "I'm
confident."
Steve nodded and grinned.
Notre Dame maintained,

Roundtree said. "Coach Hoke
says you've got to finish. It's
something we gotta deal with
now."
Though Robinson had what
he called the worst game of his
career, his five interceptions and
the dismal red-zone showing
weren't connected - Robinson
passed in the red zone as much as
Smith did: just once.
The breakdown of red-zone
snaps is equal parts peculiar and
alarming: five runs, three sacks,
an incomplete pass and an inter-
ception.
The first and only pass Robin-
son got off on Saturday in the red
zone was an incomplete heave to
junior receiver Devin Gardner
in the corner of the end zone on
a last-ditch effort with less than
four minutes remaining in the
game.
The ratio, though, shouldn't
necessarily be a surprise. Against
Massachusetts last week, Michi-
gan ran 13 running plays and four
pass plays in the red zone.
When asked what caused the
red-zone futility, Notre Dame's
scheme or Michigan's execution,
Hoke admitted, "It's always a lit-
tle bit of both."
The remedy?
"Score touchdowns," Hoke
said. "How do you do that? You
keep working your red-zone
offense, you keep knocking holes
in the defense, you keep running
crisp routes, you keep throwing
the ball on target."

ERINKIRKLAND/Daily
Michigan coach Brady Hoke and Michigan drove into the red zone five times but came away with just six points.

asked about it. Michigan just self-
destructed on its own.
It began with a drive that start-
ed on the Notre Dame 10-yard
line midway through the first
quarter. After a rush by redshirt
junior Fitzgerald Toussaint lost
two yards, Robinson was sacked
on consecutive plays for losses
of three and 10 yards. Already
backed beyond the red zone, red-
shirt junior Brendan Gibbons
missed the 43-yard field goal.
Later in the quarter, after Rob-
inson scampered down to the
Notre Dame 10 once again for a
first down, Borges called for a
toss sweep to the right. Senior
this time, there was no Heming-
way there to catch it, so he
started running. Six times that
drive he ran, but Notre Dame
had seen this before, too, and
held Michigan to a field goal.
Michigan was within strik-
ing distance, 10-3.
Relieved, Robinson's girl-
friend returned to her row. This
was what it was supposed to
look like.
Something happened. It was
hard to see at the time.
Michigan just doesn't kick
many field goals. Robinson
is too explosive to not score
touchdowns.
The Fighting Irish answered
Michigan's score with a field
goal of their own, and what's
more, they chewed up clock.
Notre Dame led 13-3. Robin-
son's girlfriend was back at the
wall, this time joined by Paris.
Again, Robinson drove
downfield for a field goal. The
three points made sense, cut-
ting the lead to one score, but
only 3:27 remained. For the first
time, this did not look right.
Last year, Michigan had more
time.
"It's close, man," Durrel said.
For the first time, Durrel was
nervous.
Remember when it was over
a year ago, you hugged your
friends and waved your pom
poms and screamed? This
year, the Notre Dame students
embraced their players and
waved Irish flags and yelled.
Remember how late you
stayed? Sang songs into the
night?
This year, the Notre Dame
faithful stayed until well after
the game, singing "Oh What a
Night!" while the band danced
along.
For all the fireworks, magic
and electrifying runs that have
marked Robinson's first two
games against Notre Dame, this
one ended with a thud.
The Fighting Irish had finally
solved the problem of Robinson
on the game's final possession:
don't let Robinson have the ball
of the game's final possession.
The game ended with two
Notre Dame first downs and a
Tommy Rees kneel.
"It's about time," said Eugene
Sharp, the usher in the parents
section. "About damn time. I
was still mad from last year."
Durrel and his companions

lingered for a few minutes.
Usually, Robinson doesn't like
to talk after a game, and Dur-
rel said he hadn't planned any-
thing to say to his little brother.
Under the stadium, Robinson
called the loss "the most disap-
pointed I've been in myself" in
22 years.
Finally, Robinson's bigbroth-
er, best friends and girlfriend -
shocked, just like you - got up
and left.
There was nothing to say.

running back Vincent Smith
took the pitch and immediately
looked to pass. He rose over an
unrushing defender and aimed
for junior receiver Drew Dileo at
the goal line, but he misfired and
was intercepted by Notre Dame
freshman Nicky Baratti.
"If we get behind the guy and
throw the ball a little deeper it's
a good play," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke.
The third trip to the red zone
saw Robinson take the first snap
and bust up the middle for an
eight-yard gain - before fum-
bling the ball away on a hit by
junior linebacker Danny Spond.
NOTRE DAME
From Page1B
came when fifth-year senior run-
ning back Vincent Smith was
intercepted on a halfback pass
play after the team had driven to
the Notre Dame 10-yard line.
It seemed like a fluke, a gim-
mick play that overshadowed
how crisply Robinson's passing
had moved the offense down the
field. But it proved to be just the
start of Robinson's nightmarish
night - the quarterback's next
three pass attempts were picked
off. (Though the last of which was
a low-risk Hail Mary at the end of
the first half.)
And after it appeared that the
Michigan offense had rediscov-
ered its rhythm, putting together
a sustained drive in its first pos-
session after halftime, it just as
quickly lost it when Robinson
fumbled the ball at Notre Dame's
eight-yard line.
The struggles in the passing
game weren't completely Rob-
inson's fault. Fifth-year senior
Roy Roundtree admitted that he
and the receivers weren't always
doing their part, and he credited
the Notre Dame defense for its
confusing looks.
But Robinson would have none
of that after the game. He called it
the "worst game of (his) career,"
and seemed to put all the blame
on his shoulders.
The Fighting Irish offense
wasn't exactly a well-oiled
machine either, with Everett Gol-
son benched in favor of former
starter Tommy Rees in the sec-
ond quarter. But the unit was able

to do just enough to take advan-
tage of the Wolverines'-mistakes,
tallying what proved to be the
decisive 10 points in that same
period.
After Golson threw two early
interceptions, Notre Dame played
largely mistake-free the rest of
the way. In a grinder of a game,
that was all that the home team
had to do - the six turnovers
it forced provided just enough
breathing room.
"I mean, (Robinson's) gotten
me the past two years, and total,
Michigan's got me three years,"
said Notre Dame linebacker
Manti Teo, who caught two of
Robinson's interceptions justover
a week after his grandmother and,
girlfriend both passed away.
"So I'm just glad on my last
one, on my last hurrah, I was
finally able to have something to
celebrate about, you know?"

The disappointment was an
unfamiliar feeling for the Wol-
verines, who themselves had
gotten used to celebrating after
this rivalry game in recent years.
But their six turnovers - five
from Robinson - made a win an
impossibility in the final try for
the quarterback and his fellow
seniors.
In the wake of his perfor-
mance, Robinson said he was
going to talk to the team on
Sunday about how he would be
accountable to them going for-
ward. And as the fans filed out on
Saturday night after Michigan's
reversal of fortune, his promise to
never play like this again seemed
to echo around Notre Dame Sta-
dium.
"Whatever it takes for the team
to win, that's what I'm going to
do," Robinson said. "I don't want
to feel like this anymore."

Another red-zone mishap
came when a 14-play march
downfield stalled on the 15-yard
line and Gibbons banged home a
chip-shot field goal.
And the fifth and final trip to
the red zone came with Michi-
gan scrambling to make up a
two-score deficit. Robinson engi-
neered a six-play drive that took
the Wolverines down to the six-
yard line before a sack forced
another field goal.
Michigan never got another
chance. Robinson and Roundtree
couldn't repeat the play they'd
dreamed of for a year.
"We've got to finish, man,"

Senior quarterback Denard Robinson threw four interceptions.

10-0.

Michigan opens Big Ten play
with split vs. Indiana, Purdue

Redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Adam Grinwis allowed a pair of goals in Michigan's 2-0 loss on Sunday.
Northwestern edges past
in conference opener

By RAJAT KHARE
Daily Sports Writer
Facing Northwestern in
Evanston, Ill. on the opening
day of Big Ten play, the Michi-
gan men's soccer team entered
the competition with high
hopes of a victory. Instead, it left
with a 2-0
loss to the MICHIGAN 0
Wildcats. N'WESTERN 2
And to
say that Michigan Head coach
Chaka Daley wasn't pleased
with the teams past three per-
formances would be a grave
understatement.
After losing twice to ranked
opponents two weekends ago,
Michigan's struggles continued
against the Wildcats. The Wol-
verines competed formidably
against both Marquette and
Notre Dame - in fact they had
even been in positions to upset
both teams - but were unable to
come away with wins.
"It's a very challenging
schedule, the first seven games,"
Daley said. "It's a tough stretch
early on."
The Wolverines started off

in less than ideal fashion for a
team looking to pull off an upset
against Northwestern. Within
the first five minutes of the
game, the Wildcats (1-0 Big Ten,
6-0-2 overall) generated a cor-
ner kick and two shots, while
Michigan's first shot didn't
come untill the 31st minute of
the game.
The Wolverines' chances
were dealt their first blow in
the 21st minute when junior
Dylan Mencia was shown a yel-
low card. On the resulting free
kick, Northwestern's Chris Rit-
ter serviced the ball into the
box, and a quick pass by Nick
Gendron to Grant Wilson beat
redshirt sophomore goalkeeper
Adam Grinwis to give the Wild-
cats the lead.
"(Our approach) didn't
change much," Daley said after
the goal. "You've gotta move
on."
Going into the game, Daley
said he emphasized to his play-
ers the importance of defend-
ing, especially on set pieces.
Northwestern continued to
push for a second goal - pepper-
ing Michigan with 10 shots and

earning five corners before the
end of the first half.
Despite the deficit, Michigan
was familiar with the fact that
1-0 is by no means a formidable
score. Two games ago, the Wol-
verines led Marquette 1-0 at
half but ended up losing, 2-1.
But any hopes of a comeback
were shot when in the 53rd min-
ute Mencia earned his second
yellow card, which resulted in
his ejection, put the Wolverines
a man down.
"Mencia's red card, his sec-
ond yellow, really changed the
game," Daley said. "It became a
lot harder to keep up."
Northwestern exploited its
man advantage and, in the 61st
minute, tallied its second goal
of the match. Ritter headed the
ball in past Grinwis off a cross
by Wilson from the left flank
in the 63rd minute for the final
tally of the match.
Any positives to take away?
"It's only one game," Daley
said.
Michigan will look to bounce
back from its loss against rival
Ohio State in its Big Ten home
opener next Sunday.

senior Claire McElheny and
junior outside hitters Molly

with junior middle blocker Jen-
nifer Cross, the Wolverines put
out their most experienced line-
up of the season.
Fortunately, the array started
when needed most.
"Bottom line is, we're going
to play whoever is best," Rosen
said. "At practice, this group has
been playing pretty well. If we
need to make changes, and we
were close to that today, the nice
thing is that we have options."
Michigan (1-1 Big Ten, 13-3

(0-2 Big Ten, 8-2, overall) in four
sets on Friday before falling to
No. 17 Purdue (2-0 Big Ten, 13-2
overall) on Saturday in five sets
to begin conference play. It was a
similar start to last season, when
the Wolverines also topped Indi-
ana and fell to the Boilermakers.
Downby two to begin the first
set to Indiana, the Wolverines
used a 6-0 run to take the lead
and a 5-0 run midway through
the set to seize the lead for good.
The Hoosiers served at fresh-
man libero Tiffany Morales early
and often on Friday, testing her
inexperience. Morales struggled
to handle the increased action at
first, unable to control the ball,
but the freshman rebounded for
a solid day and ultimately a solid
weekend, totaling 17 digs both

Morales shines in loss to Boilermakers

By DAVID BORGHARD
For the Daily
There was a silver lining for
the Michigan volleyball team,
despite losing a heartbreaker
against No. 17 Purdue (1-1 Big
Ten, 11-2 overall) on Sunday.
Freshman libero Tiffany
Morales emerged as a defensive
force, diving on the court for 17
digs.
Sophomore Jennifer Cross
and fifth-year senior Claire
McElheny were other bright
spots, and each recorded 14 kills.
Junior Molly Toon contributed
13 kills and junior Lexi Erwin
had 12. Erwin finished off the
night with a double-double, but
it was the freshman Morales
who, with her defense, led the
Wolverines the entire way.
"We want to
run our offense
... and have our
tenacity."
"We were going to go out
playing our game," Morales said.
"We want to run our offense and
our defense and have our tenac-
ity."
Morales proved to be a defen-
sive anchor for the Wolverines
(1-1, 13-3), and she led the squad
to a comeback victory on the
third set. Morales steered the
Wolverines in two major rallies.
When it looked as if Michigan
would lose the point, Morales
dove deep into the backcourt for
a save, and the crowd erupted.
She had even more digs in the
fourth set, bringing her total
to 13, but Michigan's offensive
game was nowhere to be seen.
The last set was nogdifferent,
with Morales finishing the night
up 17 digs, but Michigan ulti-
mately came up short.

THE DEFENSIVE LINE:
For the first time all
season, the embattled
defensive line held Notre
Dame to less than 100
yards rushing, Plus, they
generated enough pressure
on freshman quarterback
Everett Golson to force
the mistakes that got him
yanked from the game.
The game was far from
perfect - senior Will
Campbell led the unit with
just two solo tackles and
two assists, and the line
failed to record a sack -
but it's a step forward.
Most expected the
Fighting Irish to control
the line of scrimmage,
but the defensive line
answered with its best
performance all season.

SENIOR QUARTERBACK
DENARD ROBINSON:
Robinson's 22nd birthday
wasn't exactly happy.
Robinson threw four
straight interceptions. On
four straight attempts. And
he lost a fumble, It's tough
to win a football game
when the quarterback turns
the ball over five times.
Michigan failed to score
a touchdown for the first
time all season, largely
because the Fighting Irish
held Robinson to 3.5 yards
per carry. After the game,
Robinson apologized to the
fans, promised to get better
and called the loss the most
disappointed in himself he's
been in his life. But other
than that, Mr.- Robinson,
how was the game?
