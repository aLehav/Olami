Daily Staff Reporter 

Jawad Sukhanyar, a University 
of 
Michigan 
Knight-Wallace 
journalism fellow, presented on 
his experiences as both a civilian 
and reporter in Afghanistan 
in 
“Warzone 
Reporting: 
Experiences of a Journalist in 
Afghanistan” at the International 
House Ann Arbor. The event 
was co-sponsored by the Center 
for South Asian Studies and the 
Center for Middle Eastern and 
North African Studies. 
Sukhanyar 
is 
an 
Afghan 
reporter for The New York 
Times based in his home country. 
Working for The New York Times 
since 2011, Sukhanyar is the 
longest-serving reporter in The 
Times’ Kabul Bureau, covering 
women’s issues and human rights 
in Afghanistan.
Knight-Wallace 
Fellow 
Stephen Ssenkaaba introduced 
Sukhanyar and explained the 
prestigious 
Knight-Wallace 
fellowship.
“The 
Knight-Wallace 
journalism fellowship recognizes 

accomplished 
journalists 
committed to the future of 
journalism,” 
Ssenkaaba 
said. 
“(The 
journalists) 
deepen 
knowledge, develop new ideas, 
learn new skills and address 
challenges 
facing 
journalism 
today.” 
Sukhanyar 
began 
his 
presentation by explaining why 
he decided to pursue journalism. 
He reflected on the assassination 
of Afghan politician Ahmad 
Shah Massoud on Sept. 9, 2001, 
explaining he was terrified of 
the possibility of the Taliban 
taking control of Afghanistan. 
Sukhanyar 
described 
the 
climate of Afghanistan after the 
assassination as “the darkest days 
of Afghanistan.”
“When we heard about this we 
were shocked, we didn’t know 
what to do,” Sukhanyar said. “I 
asked my family, my brother, 
‘What’s coming next for us? What 
are we going to do?’”
Currently, the majority of 
Afghanistan is controlled by the 
Taliban. Sukhanyar expressed 
concern for the continuation of 
the war in Afghanistan.

University Students Against Rape, community members recognize , celebrate survivors

Wednesday evening, students 
and community members gath-
ered in the Michigan League for 
the 41st annual Take Back the 
Night Ann Arbor. Campus rep-
resentatives from University of 
Michigan’s University Students 

Against Rape, in cooperation 
with community leaders from 
Standing Tough Against Rape 
Society, organized the rally, 
march and vigil to recognize 
and celebrate the stories of sex-
ual assault survivors.
Public Policy senior Nicole 
Kozlowski, University Students 
Against Rape senior student 
leader, hoped to encourage 
a conversation about sexual 
assault prevention and recov-

ery.
“First and foremost, we’re 
here to raise awareness 
about sexual violence not 
only on college campuses, but 
in our community,” Kozlowski 
said. “So I think just being able 
to recognize that it is a problem 
and it is a problem that every-
one can work on and fix, that is 
the overall message.” 
Information senior Stepha-
nie Schouman, also a University 

Students Against Rape senior 
student leader, discussed the 
welcoming space they hope to 
create with the event.
“Whoever you are or whatev-
er your story or background is 
… this is a place where you can 
come and be believed, and be 
heard, and that there are people 
out there who care about you, 
and you are never alone in this 
fight,” Schouman said.

KARTIK SUNDARAM/Daily
Students and community members participate in a rally against sexual violence at the Take Back the Night rally and march at the in downtown 
Ann Arbor Wednesday evening.

On Wednesday evening, Hillel’s 
Israel Leadership, Engagement, 
Advocacy & Dialogue student 
group invited Professor Victor 
Lieberman to host a lecture in 
Hillel’s auditorium to discuss 
Israeli-Palestinian 
relations. 
Lieberman drew largely on the 
curriculum of his course, titled 
The History of the Arab-Israeli 
Conflict, during his discussion, 
which was planned in preparation 
for the upcoming Israeli election 
next week.
Lieberman’s lecture provided 
an in-depth background of the 
historical 
conflict 
between 
Israelis and Palestinians. His 
outline of Israeli and Palestinian 
politics spread across many facets 
of the issue, from an analysis 
of Palestinian popular opinion 
and Israel’s political spectrum 
to a discussion of the differences 
and similarities between the 
groups. He provided the audience 
with a list of the key parties 
and organizations involved to 
familiarize the audience with 
the political situation in the two 
nations.

Offering donuts, candy and 
engaging conversations, the Uni-
versity of Michigan’s Islamic 
Society of Ahl-ul-Bayt, along 
with the Muslim Students’ Asso-
ciation, hosted a “Meet a Muslim” 
table in Mason Hall Wednesday 
to open dialogue between Mus-
lim and non-Muslim students 
on campus. The event is part of 
a series of events hosted by ISA 
during their Muslim Engagement 
week. 
According to Syed Rizvi, ISA 
president and LSA junior, the 
event was designed to allow non-
Muslim students as well as Mus-
lim students of different sects to 

engage in conversations to better 
understand different student per-
spectives on campus.
“We want to spread aware-
ness about what Islam is, and an 
opportunity with a non-Muslim 
to talk with a Muslim and get 
familiar with Muslims,” Rizvi 
said. “By doing that, people will 
feel more comfortable with each 
other, but also for other Muslims 
to meet other types of Muslims 
like Sunnis and Shias can meet 
one another. It’s pretty fun meet-
ing new people, people are actu-
ally talking and learning more 
about us.”
ISA advisor and LSA senior 
Shabber Syed said conversations 
about student differences do not 
always happen on campus and 

are necessary to recognize and 
give voices to smaller communi-
ties.
“I feel like sometimes we don’t 
have the conversations we should 
be having to essentially empower 
some of the communities we 
have,” Syed said. “I feel like this is 
a good way to have people come 
up and talk to us, not only to 
decrease ignorance but increase 
knowledge and empower Mus-
lims and feel like we are here and 
people actually want to talk to us 
about what makes us different. 
You can come talk to us about 
anything you want, not necessar-
ily to normalize us only but again 
just to let people know its ok to 
come ask us questions.”
Another ISA advisor, Fatima 

Haidar, said practicing these 
interactions with students from 
different backgrounds and cul-
tures is key to developing com-
fortable discussion.
“It can go both ways, it can be 
either really great or really not. I 
used to avoid having these con-
versations but I think when you 
become more comfortable with 
your identity in a space where 
your identity stands out i feel like 
it becomes easier to have those 
conversations because you begin 
to know how to navigate it even if 
the other person doesn’t.”
LSA freshman Noelle Seward 
visited the table and said hearing 
different perspectives helps com-
bat stereotypes about different 
students.

On Wednesday night, about 
25 students gathered in the 
School of Education for an event 
held by Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs as part of Arab Heritage 
Month. The event centered 
around Arab masculinity and 
mental health.
It was hosted by Robbie 
Abdelhoq, a program manager 
for 
the 
Office 
of 
Student 
Conflict Resolution, and Jad 
Elharake, a program lead at 
the Office for Health Equity 
and Inclusion and the Office of 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
Abdelhoq began by discussing 
the context surrounding the 
event.
“We 
are 
having 
this 
conversation in the #MeToo 
era, in the era in which the 
conversation 
around 
sexual 
assault, 
sexual 
harassment, 
behavior of men, the complicity 
of men. This is the backdrop to 
this conversation,” he said. 
Before beginning the formal 
presentation, he explained what 
he hoped attendees would take 
away from the conversation.

What made you want to 
start your own clothing 
company? 

I’ve been interested in fashion 
since about my freshman 
year in high school, more 
specifically repurposed 
fashion. I started thrift 
shopping a lot and had ideas 
for very vintage-type clothes 
with combined patterns, but 
I wasn’t great at sewing at 
that point. So, a few years ago 
my mom decided she wanted 
to start making versatile 
headbands and later taught 
me how to sew. I then realized 
I could finally start creating 
other clothing products that 
would fit the vintage style I 
had in mind. I then wanted to 
take it outside of headbands 
and turn it into a real clothing 
company.

LSA SG hosts mental health discussion

“Health Experiences and Expressions Speak-Out” talks anxiety, depression 

BEN ROSENFELD
Daily Staff Reporter 

On 
Wednesday 
night, 
LSA 
student 
government 
held an event titled “Health 
Experiences and Expressions 
Speak-Out” at the School of 
Education, facilitating an open 
discussion 
of 
the 
physical 
and mental health struggles 
students face over the course of 
their college careers.
During 
the 
discussion, 
students 
shared 
their 
experiences 
with 
physical 
and mental health in a college 

setting.
LSA 
student 
government 
representative Natalie Suh, an 
LSA freshman, explained the 
goal of the Speak-Out was to 
provide an opportunity for open 
conversation between students, 
in order to normalize struggles 
with anxiety and mental health. 
“We wanted to host this 
event to destigmatize talking 
about 
mental 
health,” 
Suh 
said. “So whatever spectrum 
you’re on, whatever you fall 
under, we want everybody to 
be comfortable talking about 
it, 
and 
to 
be 
comfortable 

expressing themselves without 
any fear of judgment.”
During the open discussion 
portion 
of 
the 
event, 
one 
student explained the tendency 
for professors to take physical 
health issues more seriously 
than mental health issues with 
regards to students’ academic 
needs. Later, another attendee 
explained 
the 
difficulty 
in 
expressing 
depression 
and 
anxiety to family members.
LSA freshman Madison Burt 
shared a personal story about 
coping with problems of mental 
health in a collegiate setting. 
Burt told The Daily after the 
event that the small setting 
of the Speak-Out and the 
receptiveness of participants 
encouraged her to share her 
own experiences with others.
“It was really cool to be 
able to do that,” Burt said. 
“Definitely being able to get 
some things off my chest and 
hear about some different 
resources 
and 
really 
just 
understand 
that 
everybody 
goes through it, was definitely 
a nice way to end the day.”
Burt was also one of two 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center 
representatives present at the 
Speak-Out. She said a central 
goal of events held by SAPAC 
and LSA Student Government 
such as the Speak-Out is to 
help 
students 
understand 
they can approach University 
resources with any range of 
concerns. 
“It’s 
not 
just 
sexual 
harassment necessarily,” Burt 
said regarding SAPAC’s scope. 
“Stalking, they take care of 
things like that too, or just bad 
relationships in general. So 

understanding that you don’t 
necessarily need to fit a certain 
position to be able to use the 
resources — just if you need 
help, we’re here.”
In addition to volunteers 
from SAPAC, Carol Tucker, 
a Wolverine Wellness health 
educator, participated in the 
discussion, informing students 
about the numerous resources 
the 
University 
provides 
to 
students. Tucker talked about 
her work with students seeking 
help related to physical and 
mental health problems.
“People come to me with all 
kinds of things, anywhere from 
procrastination, to dealing with 
something going on in your 
family, to wanting to exercise 
more, 
the 
whole 
gambit,” 
Tucker said. “You can talk about 
anything, and we have wellness 
coaches, not only at UHS and 
Wolverine Wellness but also 
other places around campus.”
Among the other resources, 
Tucker 
referenced 
was 
the 
Well-being page developed by 
University Health Services last 
year, located on each University 
of Michigan student’s Canvas 
site.
“The 
Well-being 
site 
on 
Canvas developed out of a 
widespread 
recognition 
that 
students 
wanted 
to 
have 
at-their-fingertips 
access 
to 
(mental 
health) 
resources,” 
Tucker said. “It was a student 
suggestion that it lived on 
Canvas. We worked with a wide 
variety of people, the Wolverine 
Support Network, CSG, CAPS, 
lots of other places.”

By examining the intentions 
of Israeli and Palestinian groups, 
both past and present, Lieberman 
engaged in a conversation with 
attendees, contemplating the future 
of negotiations between the two 
nations. 
“From the 1990s to about 2014, 
the two-state solution was the 
official goal of the Israeli government 
and the Palestinian Authority, the 
PA,” Lieberman said. “Today most 
commentators agree that the two-
state solution is on life support, if it’s 
not dead completely. So what’s next? 
How do Israelis and Palestinians 
see the future, and what do they say 
they want? In each case, what’s the 
mix between rational thinking and 
irrational impulse?”
Lieberman later expressed some 
doubt that Israeli and Palestinian 
groups will reach an agreement 
regarding the ongoing land dispute 
between the two nations, which 

provoked a broad spectrum of 
reactions from audience members.
LSA 
freshman 
Henry 
Wolle 
shared his own interpretation of 
Lieberman’s words to The Daily after 
the event, as well as some thoughts 
about the issue.
“I take it that this professor 
imagines the state of affairs as locked 
in one way and his understanding 
is both sides can’t come to a real 
reconciliation,” Wolle said. “So, 
that’s sort of where he bases his 
speculation. That’s my understanding 
of his presentation… I agree with the 
frozen-ness that he presented, and I 
recognize that from the conversations 
that I’ve had with people.”
Following the lecture portion of 
the event, Lieberman opened up the 
floor for attendees to share their own 
thoughts, ideas and questions. Orr 
Viznitser, a Jewish Agency Israel 
Fellow, added to the conversation 
by sharing her personal beliefs and 
experiences as an Israel native.

MICHIGAN DAILY ALUMNI TALK

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Former Michigan Daily Editorial Page Editor Mark Dillen discusses his career in journalism and the foreign services in an 
alumni talk held in the Paul Brentlinger Conference Room of the Stanford Lipsey Student Publications Building Wednesday.

“It has been 18 years since the 
war began … there is no end to 
this war,” Sukhanyar said. “What 
is going on? You don’t see any 
sign of victory.”
Sukhanyar 
also 
addressed 
problems regarding security in 
Afghanistan. He said the lack 
of training in Afghan security 
forces causes the country to 
suffer from external danger.
“The security is not improving, 
it’s reversing,” Sukhanyar said. 
“You don’t see any improvement 
on the ground. Afghan security 
forces lack resources, they’re not 
as professional as international 
forces … that means life is harder, 
it’s more dangerous for us, for the 
civilians.”
While reporting for the The 
New York Times in Afghanistan, 
Sukhanyar interviewed a man 
later featured in The Times’ 
video “Injured and Abandoned in 
Afghanistan.” The video features 
a former Afghan police officer 
who lost his leg, and his struggle 
to survive on the streets of Kabul, 
Afghanistan.
Sukhanyar said he first got into 
contact with the man after he 
noticed him begging for money in 
the street while driving home. He 
said he approached the man for 
several consecutive days to ask 
about what he was doing before 
revealing he was a reporter and 
requesting an interview.
According to Sukhanyar, the 
man joined the police academy 
in 
which 
American 
troops 
were involved. While training 
in 
southeastern 
Afghanistan, 
a bomb detonated on the man, 
resulting in him and two of 
his colleagues suffering severe 
injuries. As result, the men were 
unable to continue to work as 
officers. After this happened, the 
man’s family, including his wife 
and two children, disowned him.
“This 
young 
Afghan 
was 
trained by the Americans, fought 
in this war, and finally this is what 
his life is,” Sukhanyar said. “He’s 
living on the streets of Kabul, and 
he’s (begging) during the evening 

when it’s dark because he doesn’t 
want to be seen by his friends and 
by people that knew him.”
Sukhanyar also highlighted 
another reporting experience 
where he interviewed a man 
whose young son was shot point-
blank by the Taliban.
“When I was talking to this 
man, who himself was a warrior 
during the Soviet division of 
Afghanistan, he told me that 
it’s very painful to lose his son,” 
Sukhanyar said. “It’s very, very 
horrible to lose his son … it was 
very moving and emotional for 
me.”
While discussing the future 
of 
Afghanistan, 
Sukhanyar 
said he does not know what 
is coming. After he completes 
his Knight-Wallace fellowship 
at the University, Sukhanyar 
said he plans to move back to 
Afghanistan, despite the current 
corruption in the country.
“I was hoping to go back to my 
country, to live in my country, 
even though I know it’s not 
going to be as fun as I expect.,” 
Sunhanyar said. “... I know living 
here would be much, much better 
for me, for my kids, they would 
have a good future, but I don’t 
want to close the door for other 
Afghans who are working there. 
They might get an opportunity to 
come to programs like the one I 
came and get a job.”
Bruce 
Martin, 
executive 
director of International House 
Ann Arbor, commented on the 
importance of both telling and 
listening to stories. He said he 
thought it was important for 
Americans to hear stories such 
as Sukhanyar’s because what 
the United States does in other 
countries has a direct impact on 
their lives.
“I always like to say to 
people, we’re all about stories, 
and everybody has a story,” 
Martin said. “Everybody also 
has a right to tell those stories 
in their own voice and listen to 
others’ stories. What they do 
with that information is up to 
them, but stories can be powerful 
motivators, impact lives and 
shape responses.”

“What 
I 
hope 
you 
will 
leave with today is what is my 
obligation to helping change to 
helping this situation that we’re 
in,” Abdelhoq said. “And also 
you helping to understand in a 
healthy way what masculinity 
means.”
The first topic centered around 
how masculinity has typically 
been portrayed. They explained 
academic writing on masculinity 
has often been written by and 
for white men and why this is 
problematic 
when 
discussing 
Arab masculinity.
“That 
conversation 
really 
transitions and does a shift 
when it comes to Arab men, and 
this is also true for other men of 
color,” Elharake said. “Even as I 
think about myself, I was born 
in Lebanon and immigrated here 
when I was seven. Masculinity 
looks very different in Lebanon.”
 
Abdelhoq 
and 
Elharake 
then began discussing social 
constructions 
of 
masculinity 
and how they influence men’s 
behavior. 
They 
described 
three 
categories: 
hegemonic 
masculinity, 
the 
traditional 
stereotype 
of 
masculinity, 
complicit 
masculinity, 
where 
men receive the benefits of 
masculinity, and marginalized 
masculinity, where men are 
given power based on their 
gender while being marginalized 
in other ways.
Abdelhoq said he believed 
many men fit into the category 
of complicit masculinity. He 
said though they aren’t directly 

perpetuating 
inequality, 
they 
are still receiving the benefits of 
their masculinity.
“My sense is that a lot of men 
fall into this category,” he said. 
“A lot of men don’t fit into all the 
characteristics or all the defining 
factors 
of 
what 
hegemonic 
masculinity looks like, but also 
don’t challenge how they were 
socialized.”
Abdelhoq also explained many 
men of color are often unwilling 
to stand up for women when 
discussing issues of gender. 
“A lot of times (for) men of color, 
this discussion of community 
will hinge on their marginalized 
identity,” Abdelhoq said. “They 
will really go to bat for people 
when it comes to issues of race, 
and then fall deadly silent when 
it comes to issues of sexism.”
The event then transitioned to 
how stereotypes of masculinity 
are formed at a young age. The 
presenters put a list of phrases 
up on the screen that men 
commonly hear and asked the 
men in the audience to raise their 
hands if they had ever received 
the comment. When asked about 
the phrase “man up,” every man 
in the audience raised their hand. 
They 
also 
discussed 
how 
traditional notions of masculinity 
are perpetuated by “groupthink.” 
They explained that though it’s 
commonly assumed that men 
act masculine for women, the 
opposite is true; men often act 
masculine around men to be 
accepted.
Abdelhoq 
and 
Elharake 
explained how Arab identity 
interacts with both masculinity 
and 
femininity, 
offering 
examples of traditional gender 
roles in Arab families.

“We see this even thinking 
about our roles in our families 
— who cooks, who cleans, who 
eats where?” Elharake asked. 
“At least in my experience, often 
Arab men are allowed to go out 
past a certain time and often 
Arab women have to be back by 
six or seven.”
Abdelhoq pointed out this 
inequality has been made clear, 
especially as progress is made 
towards equality.
“There has been an uptick in 
the need to reinforce traditional 
values,” Adelhoq said. “Men’s 
knee jerk response has been 
to 
re-establish 
traditional 
boundaries that perhaps some 
movement has been made on.”
The event concluded with 
interactive exercises. The first 
asked the audience to choose 
which of two men better fit the 
mold of traditional masculinity 
— those chosen included Russian 
President Vladimir Putin, rapper 
Meek Mill and Portuguese soccer 
player Cristiano Ronaldo.
The 
audience 
was 
also 
prompted 
to 
guess 
what 
percentage of men surveyed 
reported being uncomfortable 
when the terms “bitch” and “slut” 
were used in reference to women. 
Though 
audience 
members 
guessed five and 12 percent, the 
answer was revealed to be 81.
When asked how one could 
help challenge negative effects of 
masculinity, both Abdelhoq and 
Elharake provided input.
“Have the courage to say 
something when and if it comes 
up,” Abdelhoq said. “I think 
inherently and intuitively you’re 
going to know this when it 
happens, it’s having the courage 
to say something about it.” 

Elharake 
offered 
similar 
advice for students, both for 
those who identify as Arab men 
and those who do not.
“We think about spaces that 
we’re in — small classrooms and 
large ones — a lot of comments 
are really thrown out that 
promote or encourage this toxic 
masculinity and behavior,” he 
said. “And obviously I’m looking 
at it through a larger lens, realize 
how 
that 
impacts 
everyone, 
those who are men, and women, 
and outside those binary genders 
as well. It’s really important to 
recognize masculinity has an 
impact on everyone.”
Business 
graduate 
student 
Rajiv 
Khattar 
attended 
the 
event, and in an interview 
with 
The 
Daily 
after 
the 
event he commented on the 
importance of understanding 
intersectionality 
when 
discussing masculinity. 
“When we just look at 
masculinity there’s a lot we 
could talk about,” Khattar 
said. “Then we talk about 
the 
Arab 
identity, 
there’s 
a lot we could talk about. 
Then we add mental health. 
It’s understanding all these 
individual identities take on a 
slightly different flavor with 
the other ones is important.”
When explaining why he 
came to the event Khattar 
discussed the lack of visibility 
this topic receives.
“I 
thought 
it 
was 
an 
interesting 
event,” 
Khattar 
said. 
“The 
intersection 
of 
masculinity and mental health 
from a person of color lens 
isn’t exactly something we see 
a lot.”

alone in this fight,” Schouman 
said.
LSA senior Sabrina Angel 
volunteers for University Stu-
dents Against Rape and became 
involved with the group after 
coming to TBTN her freshman 
year.
“I’m a survivor myself, so 
this has really been an organi-
zation which helped me kind 
of come to terms with my story 
and really be able to support 
others who had the same kind 
of experience I had,” Angel 
said. “It means a lot to me that 
I get to support other people, 
especially because I didn’t feel 
like I had a support system until 
I came to Take Back the Night.”
Angel said she appreciates 
the refreshing positivity of 
TBTN.
“This event is not really 
about sadness or dwelling on 
experiences of the past,” Angel 
said. “We’re here to support 
the growth that survivors have 
achieved.”
TBTN is a national organi-
zation that started when Cali-
fornian sex workers decided 
to protest their working condi-
tions. Kozlowski explained the 
tradition as being purposefully 
radical and disruptive.
“It’s going into the streets, 
being like, ‘We’re out here. 
We’re loud. We’re going into 

the streets. We’re taking back 
the night,’” Kozlowski said.
Kozlowski said TBTN Ann 
Arbor is unique because it exists 
at an intersection between 
campus and community activ-
ism. Community organizer Pam 
Swider, director of STARS, first 
became involved with TBTN 
Ann Arbor 11 years ago.
“I am a survivor myself, and I 
wanted to do something to give 
back,” Swider said. “When I was 
going through therapy, Take 
Back the Night was important 
to me so I always kind of imag-
ined participating.”
Swider believes TBTN Ann 
Arbor is strengthened by the 
constant presence of certain 
community 
members 
which 
complements 
the 
transient 
nature of student leaders as 
they periodically graduate and 
move away.
“I think it’s important to see 
that the community cares and 
that they can come together to 
help,” Swider said.
This year’s TBTN event was 
“Uplifting Voices.” Organizers 
made an effort over the years 
to showcase intersectionality 
in the event. Swider said this 
year, TBTN’s theme attempts 
to reflect an increased sense of 
inclusion.
“We want to recognize that 
we can’t know everything, but 
we want to celebrate everyone,” 
Kozlowski said.
Schouman said she hopes 
efforts to combat sexual assault 

will expand as the variety 
of those identities which are 
actively welcomed into spaces 
such as TBTN increases.
“We’re trying to have an air 
of inclusivity,” Schouman said. 
“...It’s obviously not a just a 
women’s issue, it’s obviously 
not just a white person’s issue, 
like bringing everybody into 
that space.”
Schouman 
discussed 
the 
power the march has to spread 
its message throughout the 
community.
“People will stare at you but 
there’s also people that will 
applaud you going by,” Schou-
man said. “If they find out 
that this is what it’s for, they 
might get angry, or they might 
be like ‘Oh I didn’t know this 
was something we had in Ann 
Arbor’ and like it can spark that 
sort of interest … It’s definitely 
about causing a disturbance to 
start a conversation.”
The event’s keynote speaker 
was Internet performer, poet 
and actor Kevin Kantor. Kan-
tor shared their experience as 
a queer victim of sexual assault. 
Kantor appreciated how TBTN 
Ann Arbor made a special 
effort to recognize the stories 
of non-female sexual assault 
survivors.
“This is what I like,” Kantor 
said. “This is the unity.”
Kantor encouraged survivors 
to be “selfish” in their recovery 
and said people are more than 
their survivorship.

“You deserve joy,” Kantor 
said. “You deserve your rage. 
Get to work.”
Throughout the night, speak-
ers echoed a repeated call to 
action. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
recorded a video for the rally 
to be played in her absence, in 
which she encouraged attend-
ees to also “get to work.”
LSA freshman Chloe Carl-
son attended the event as an 
ally with sisters from the Uni-
versity’s feminist sorority, Zeta 
Omega Eta. She said there is 
still a lot of work to be done 
through the feminist move-
ment.
“I feel like it’s gotten better, 
then it’s gotten worse,” Carlson 
said.
Schouman also emphasized 
the importance of involving as 
many people as possible in the 
cause.
“Whether you have a story, 
or not, whether you’ve told your 
story before, or you haven’t, or 
if you’re even just an ally just to 
be here and to celebrate survi-
vors and taking a stand against 
sexual assault...we’re glad that 
you’re here,” Schouman said.
Engineering 
junior 
Rosie 
Van Alsburg, also a member of 
Zeta Omega Eta, hopes she and 
her sisters’ presence will show 
survivors they have support on 
campus.
“I hope just being here will 
let survivors know that we’re 
here for them,” Van Alsburg 
said.

“I think it’s a really good way 
to share your culture with people 
because there are a lot of things 
people don’t know and people 
just assume things,” Seward said. 
“It was interesting, I like to hear 
from other people’s perspectives 
because so many people just make 
assumptions about others.
According to Haidar, helping 
attendees feel comfortable asking 
questions was critical to creating 
productive dialogue.
“I’ve already engaged in some 
good conversations,” Haidar said. 
“I try to break the ice by starting 
off with questions that may seem 
ridiculous but i’ve gotten like oh 
are you bald, and I tell them no, 
or do you shower with that on, 
like no. I feel like it cracks the ice 
because once you start with the 
dumbest questions it goes on from 
there.”
According to Business senior 
Mohammad Shaikh, the series of 
events was previously titled their 
Islamic Awareness week, Shaikh 
said the change came from their 
desire to have more hands-on and 
engaging conversations with the 

Muslim community on campus. 
“Beyond just raising awareness 
— while that is important — we’re 
trying to get people to actually 
not just be aware of what Islam 
is but actually engage with it,” 
Shaikh said. “In the past it was 
called Islamic Awareness Week, 
but we intentionally changed it to 
engagement week so people can 
engage with Muslims and their 
contributions to society at large.”
Syed said he hopes the engag-
ing conversations will continue 
outside the conversations had at 
the table.
“I feel like usually these kind 
of events are very successful, but 
the problem is after they happen 
it kind of just goes back to nor-
mal, people don’t ask questions 
anymore,” Syed said. “What’s’ 
actually really unfortunate some-
times is I feel like other Muslims 
don’t actually ask other Muslims, 
by different denominations, they 
sometimes don’t ask questions 
that they should be. I feel like 
those are conversations we need 
to start having more on campus, 
especially to be more inclusive 
like we try to promote here at the 
University of Michigan.”

F

ormer Vice President 
Joe Biden is without 
a doubt one of the 
most 
beloved 
political 
figures in the Democratic 
Party. He’s so likeable that 
even 
Republicans 
respect 
him — he was known to be 
good friends with former 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., 
before his passing — and he 
has consistently stayed at 
the top of the Democratic 
presidential primary polls. 
People don’t just love Joe 
Biden. They idolize him as 
“Uncle Joe”: patron of ice 
cream, man of the people 
and forever partner-in-crime 
to President Barack Obama. 
Until recently, I was one of 
these people.
However, in the wake of 
the recent news surrounding 
his behavior towards former 
Nevada 
state 
legislator 
Lucy Flores — as well as his 
response to her article — I’m 
reminded of why idolizing 
public figures is incredibly 
dangerous.
On 
March 
29, 
Flores 
published a piece in The 
Cut 
titled 
“An 
Awkward 
Kiss Changed How I Saw 
Joe Biden.” In it, she sets 
the 
scene 
in 
which 
the 
awkward 
kiss 
happened: 
it’s 2014, and Joe Biden is 
attending a political event in 
Nevada to help Democratic 
candidates 
like 
Flores 
in 
the gubernatorial election. 
She then details the moment 
Biden invaded her personal 
space, writing, “I felt him get 
closer to me from behind… He 
proceeded to plant a big slow 
kiss on the back of my head.” 
She then goes on to explain, 
“as a young Latina in politics, 
I had gotten used to feeling 
like an outsider in rooms 
dominated by white men… he 
made me feel uneasy, gross 
and 
confused. 
The 
vice-
president of the United States 
of America had just touched 
me 
in 
an 
intimate 
way 
reserved for close friends, 
family or romantic partners 
— and I felt powerless to do 
anything about it.”
Flores’s incident is only 
one in a long list of moments 
when 
Biden 
has 
touched 
women 
inappropriately. 
The New York Post recently 
published 
a 
slideshow 
of 
other 
times 
he’s 
touched 
women and young girls. In 
one photo, he’s seen placing 
the same “big slow kiss” 
on the niece of Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, 
R-Ky., 
at 
a 
Capitol Hill event. In others, 
he’s captured kissing women 
on the lips, grabbing them 
around the waist, hugging 
them from behind and more.
A representative for Biden 
responded to Flores’s article, 
stating: “Vice President Biden 
believes that Ms. Flores has 
every right to share her own 

recollection and reflections, 
and that it is a change for 
better in our society that she 
has the opportunity to do so. 
He respects Ms. Flores as a 
strong and independent voice 
in our politics and wishes her 
only the best.”
Biden 
then 
responded 
directly to Flores article a 
couple of days later, stating, 
“In 
my 
many 
years 
on 
the campaign trail and in 
public life, I have offered 
countless handshakes, hugs, 
expressions 
of 
affection, 
support and comfort. And not 
once — never — did I believe 
I acted inappropriately… I 
may not recall these moments 
the same way, and I may be 
surprised at what I hear. 
But we have arrived at an 
important time when women 
feel they can and should 
relate their experiences, and 
men should pay attention. 
And I will.”
According 
to 
his 
statement, Biden didn’t mean 
to make Flores uncomfortable, 
and his actions were simply 
supposed to offer comfort 
and 
camaraderie. 
This 
is 
probably true, given that he 
always touched women in 
plain sight, and the media 
always made light of his 
actions in the past. Some of 
the other women whom he 
touched might have even 
welcomed his actions. Some 
were probably moved that the 
vice president of the United 
States showed his affection 
so openly and loved him even 
more for it.
None of that matters.
Bottom 
line, 
men, 
especially ones who hold 
as much power as Biden, 
should 
not 
touch 
women 
without consent. He may 
not be “grabbing them by 
the pussy” or condemning 
Flores’s account as part of 
the “#MeToo witch hunt,” 
but he still needs to be held 
accountable for his actions 
because he acted without 
the women’s consent and 
elicited the same feelings of 
helplessness 
and 
violation 
that 
come 
with 
being 
sexually assaulted. Flores is 
not arguing that his actions 
discount all of the great 
things he’s done for the 
United States.
Yet, 
many 
people 
are 
choosing to stand by Biden 
and believe he is simply 
a 
victim 
of 
a 
woman 
overreacting to some well-
intentioned affection. Others 
are angry President Donald 
Trump’s 
assault 
survivors 
are receiving no coverage 
while 
Flores’s 
article 
continues to gain traction, 
and are urging Biden to run 
for 
president 
despite 
the 
allegations 
against 
him. 
Herein lies the crux of the 
problem. People idolize Biden 

not only for his personality, 
but because many believe he 
is the Democratic candidate 
with the greatest chance of 
beating Trump. Maybe Biden 
does have a creepy habit of 
touching women — but he’s 
still better than Trump. And 
isn’t it unfair that he’s getting 
steamrolled by the news for 
simply kissing a woman on 
the head while Trump gets 
to sit in the Oval Office after 
several women have accused 
him of sexually assaulting 
them, with the most recent 
allegation 
coming 
out 
in 
February?
However, 
discounting 
Flores’s account won’t give 
justice 
to 
other 
sexual 
assault survivors. In fact, if 
Democrats don’t hold Biden 
accountable for his actions in 
the fear it’ll hurt his chances 
at presidency, then they are 
part of the same problem they 
condemn Trump supporters 
of having.
I idolized Joe Biden. I 
believed with certainty that 
he could win the 2020 election 
and anticipated the moment 
he 
would 
announce 
his 
candidacy. However, given his 
responses to Flores’s account 
— both of which skirt around 
actually 
apologizing 
or 
admitting to wrongdoing — as 
well as his ardent supporters, 
who seem largely incapable 
of holding him accountable 
for his actions — not unlike 
Trump’s 
supporters 
— 
I 
wonder if his supporters will 
continue to turn a blind eye 
to his mistakes should he 
become president.
It’s 
incredibly 
difficult 
to 
criticize 
someone 
who 
I grew up with as my vice 
president and respect so much 
for handling every situation 
with grace and kindness. But 
Biden has failed to handle 
this situation with either of 
those qualities, and while 
I am saddened by it, it is my 
duty as both his supporter 
and a decent human being to 
hold him accountable. I hope 
he personally apologizes to 
Flores and they’re both able 
to receive closure from this 
situation. I hope Biden uses 
this moment to prove he is the 
advocate for women he claims 
to be and is willing to own up 
to his faults, even if it may 
damage his image.
Idolization is dangerous, 
and we must not forget that 
even the most respectable 
public figures are not perfect. 
A crucial part of supporting 
someone 
is 
holding 
them 
responsible when they engage 
in problematic behavior, no 
matter how difficult that may 
be. Even if that person is your 
beloved Uncle Joe.

AARON BAKER | COLUMN

The battle for Israel’s soul
O

n April 9, Israel will 
have elections for the 
premiership. 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu, Israel’s current prime 
minister, will be Israel’s longest 
serving prime minister if re-elected.
Netanyahu 
has 
long 
used 
demagogic tactics to get votes. 
Under investigation for corruption, 
he demonizes Israel’s press and 
legal system. In a previous election, 
he demonized Israeli Arabs by 
telling voters that Israeli Arabs were 
“heading to the polling stations in 
droves” to vote. Then there was the 
nation-state bill, which endorsesd 
settlement construction, and, most 
recently, a bizarre Trumpian social 
media feud with an Israeli actress 
in which Netanyahu declared 
that Israel was not a state for all its 
citizens, but rather only its Jewish 
citizens.
Netanyahu has undoubtedly 
pushed his party, the Likud-
National 
Liberal 
Movement, 
further to the right. This is most 
clear in his decision to form a 
coalition with Otzma Yehudit 
(“Jewish Power”), an extremist 
and openly racist party. The Israeli 
Supreme Court has barred Jewish 
Power candidates from running 
for prime minister due to their 
incitements of racism, but that 
hasn’t stopped Netanyahu from 
forming a coalition with them. 
Likud 
had 
previously 
denied 
Jewish Power’s strain of vitriolic 
politics from its coalition. Yitzhak 
Shamir, a Likudnik and former 
prime minister, rejected Meir 
Kahane, the extremist ideological 
predecessor to Jewish Power, by 
refusing to form a coalition with 
him and by condemning him.
Netanyahu’s biggest opponent 
is Benny Gantz, who formed the 
Blue and White Party, a centrist 
challenger to Netanyahu’s Likud 
Party. Gantz is a former high 
ranking general, whom many see 
as quintessentially Israeli. Raised 
on a kibbutz and a decorated 
former chief of staff in the Israel 
Defense Forces, Gantz may be the 
kryptonite to Netanyahu’s enduring 
grip on Israel’s political leadership. 
Electing Blue and White into the 
Knesset (Israel’s parliament) and 
Gantz into the prime minister’s seat 
would at worst mean an extension 
of the status quo, at best, the type 
of ingenuity and leadership Israel 
witnessed with Yitzhak Rabin as 
prime minister. Rabin initiated 
the greatest peace initiative in the 
history of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, 
which 
produced 
the 
Oslo accords. Both possibilities 
are far superior to the prospect of 

Netanyahu’s racism, populism and 
illiberalism being reaffirmed and 
strengthened.
As an American Jew, Israel can 
be an unnecessarily tricky subject. 
The discourse surrounding Israel 
is dominated by extremes. On one 
hand, there is the position that 
Israel can do nothing wrong. On 
the other, that Israel is to blame 
entirely for the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict 
and 
even 
broader 
instability in the Middle East. 
Supporting Israel’s right to exist as 
a homeland for Jews is not mutually 
exclusive with supporting the 
individual and collective rights 
and wellbeing of Palestinians. By 
supporting a two-state solution, 
it is possible to support both Jews 
and Palestinians.
In a perfect world a one-state 
solution would be ideal, where the 
land serves as a homeland for both 
Israelis and Palestinians under one 
state. There is nothing innate that 
prevents Jews and Arabs or Jews 
and Muslims from living among 
each other. Jews lived in the Arab 
world for centuries, facing far less 
persecution than in Christian 
Europe for most of history. 
Maimonides, arguably the most 
important rabbi in Jewish history, 
left Spain to escape the inquisition 
and went to the Ottoman empire, 
where Arab Muslim rationalists 
influenced his rabbinical thought, 
thus influencing Judaism. And 
in America, Jews and Arabs live 
side by side. No cultural, racial, 
religious or ethnic identity is 
predisposed with animus toward 
another. 
These 
identities 
are 
constructed over the complex 
course of history. Unfortunately, 
this course can include the 
development of some resented 
“other” which strengthens the 
internal bonds of the identity’s 
in-group dynamic. 
Both sides of the conflict have 
legitimate grievances. Israelis have 
the 1967 war, when the dictator of 
Egypt swore to drive the Jews to 
the sea in service of Pan-Arabism. 
There were decades of PLO 
terrorism, the intifada suicide 
bombings, followed by Hamas 
terrorism today. Israelis would also 
point to the peace deals the Israeli 
government has made in the last 20 
years that the Palestinian leadership 
has rejected. Palestinians in the 
West Bank have experienced half a 
century of occupation, checkpoints 
and resultant humiliation and 
abuse. They live with the fear of 
arrest and the presence of soldiers 
intruding in their daily lives 
and extremist settlers harassing 

them as the settlers seek to create 
an 
expansionist 
greater-Israel. 
Palestinians in Gaza have meager 
living conditions maintained by 
an Israeli blockade and the specter 
of Israeli airstrikes that devastate 
Gaza’s infrastructure and have 
deadly consequences. And for all 
Palestinians there is the memory 
of 1948, what they call the “Great 
Catastrophe” and Israelis call the 
“War of Independence.” Picking a 
side to assign total moral culpability 
is the wrong approach. Neither 
side is a monolith collectively 
responsible for the actions of each 
member of their group. But in the 
dynamics of the conflict, Jews 
against Palestinians, both have 
done wrong over the last 100 years. 
Continuing to bicker over who is 
worse stymies real momentum to 
change the status quo.
Given 
the 
intensity 
and 
length of the conflict, it is hard to 
envision how the two populations 
could live together peacefully 
in the near future, nonetheless 
create a cohesive national identity. 
Integrating the two populations 
would be a long, messy process 
likely mired by violence and what 
political scientists call “spoilers,” 
where 
extremists 
seek 
to 
undermine reconciliation between 
two groups in a conflict. A single 
state would probably devolve into 
a civil war type situation, in which 
either Israel would reassert military 
dominance or substantial third 
party intervention would need 
to assuage the violence between 
Israelis and Palestinians.
A two-state solution is thus 
the favorable solution for the near 
future. Israelis and Palestinians 
need to negotiate borders that can 
accommodate both groups. Israel 
has significantly more power and 
thus bears more responsibility to 
initiate negotiations and a deal. But 
these same power dynamics mean 
the Palestinian leadership needs a 
greater willingness to compromise. 
Since the Oslo accords, Palestinian 
leaders in the West Bank have not 
dropped the demand for the right of 
return to Israel proper, essentially 
meaning that they only support a 
one-state solution. And in Gaza, 
Hamas calls for the destruction 
of Israel and the death of Jews 
globally.

M

y story is probably 
different 
than 
many 
of 
the 
stories you’ll read here. I 
was sexually abused by my 
(now ex) boyfriend during 
my freshman year of college, 
repeatedly. 
The 
abuse 
started slowly and subtly 
at first; pushing me to go 
farther than I wanted, saying 
“please.” 
And 
gradually 
over time he became more 
demanding and even violent 
before descending into frank 
disregard for my consent or 
lack thereof. Once when I 
asked him to stop, he said 
he couldn’t because I was 
“too sexy” and therefore he 
couldn’t help himself. After 
that, I didn’t feel comfortable 
with my naked body and for 
a period of time would wear 
swimsuits to shower. It got 
to the point where I knew I 
couldn’t say “no” because if 
I did, he wouldn’t care and 
having him blatantly ignore 
my pleas to stop hurt more 
than going along with what 
he wanted. I used to think 
I was weak for not putting 
up more of a fight, but I’ve 
realized it was a form of self-
preservation and may have 
saved me from something 
worse.
He was smart enough to 
not leave marks and to avoid 
triggering the usual “red 
flags” we’re warned about 
for abusers like being overly 
possessive or jealous. The 
truth is, I didn’t escape in the 
night to a domestic violence 
shelter or triumphantly break 

up with him; he broke up 
with me. I didn’t understand 
why until I learned through 
therapy that he is a sexual 
narcissist, 
someone 
who 
uses sexual abuse to control 
someone’s behavior.
This 
helped 
me 
to 
understand 
what 
had 
happened to me, why it was so 
difficult to get out even when 
the abuse kept getting worse 
and why he broke up with me. 
He was betting that he would 
be able to continue to control 
me without us being in an 
official relationship, but him 
breaking up with me also 
gave me an out. Even after 
the break up, he still tried to 
control me, but thankfully as 
school started up, I was in 
closer contact with friends 
and less in contact with him.
In 
some 
ways 
I 
feel 
guilty 
even 
sharing 
this, 
knowing that most others 
who 
experienced 
assault 
vehemently did not consent, 
but 
I 
sometimes 
had 
consented 
to 
intercourse 
with my boyfriend. But I 
also faced my perpetrator 
over and over again while 
loving and caring for him. 
Sometimes I feel like I should 
have left him earlier, that I 
should have known better. 
My 
friends 
and 
family’s 
disapproval for him and the 
subsequent isolation made 
me feel I couldn’t be honest 
about what was happening 
with anyone who cared about 
me and only made it more 
difficult to escape my abusive 
relationship.
In 
the 
aftermath, 
I 
dealt 
with 
symptoms 
that 
would 
likely 
qualify 
as 
Posttraumatic 
Stress 

Disorder. I had recurrent 
nightmares 
about 
the 
assaults 
and 
would 
scan 
my surroundings for him 
on campus and plan escape 
routes. 
My 
relationship 
with him had lasted a little 
over a year and there were 
reminders of him all over 
campus. 
He 
even 
started 
working at two of the same 
jobs I did after we broke up. 
It felt like I couldn’t escape. 
I had panic attacks, trouble 
concentrating 
at 
school, 
became depressed and even 
suicidal. 
Seeing 
him 
on 
campus would make my heart 
pound in my chest and make 
me feel like I needed to vomit 
— my mind would race about 
how to get away. It took a lot 
to reclaim my life and sense 
of self. I went to therapy and 
started on antidepressants. 
I explored reporting him to 
the police, but was told off-
the-record by an officer that 
a jury would find it difficult 
to convict him for assault 
when there were times it was 
consensual.
It’s 
been 
over 
seven 
years since I escaped that 
relationship. It has been a 
long road and it has not always 
been easy, but here’s what I 
will say: I am not destroyed. 
I am capable of and worthy of 
healthy relationships. I can 
love and be loved. Things do 
get better.

itcoms are as American as 
television can get: They display our 
signature appreciation for tight-
knit circles and the eerie feeling 
that although time is pushing 
onwards, you keep reaching the 
same equilibrium. In their take on 
“time,” Daily Arts Writers, Maxwell 
Schwarz and Sophia Yoon tackle 
recent changes to the sitcom form 
over time, particularly the recent 
popularization of single-camera 
comedies. While Sophia emphasizes 
the ’90s versus ’00s sitcom debate, 
Maxwell 
analyzes 
further 
to 
decipher how changes in camera 
style and humor ultimately reflects 
the changing tastes of audiences. 

If you grew up sometime within 
the past four decades, chances 
are you fall under one of three 
categories: ’90s sitcom watcher, 
’00s sitcom watcher or the kid 
who had to resort to watching 
reruns of “Judge Judy” as a 
result of having strict parents. 
In the past, I was stuck in the 
third category, yet despite 
my exclusion, the genre of 
situation comedy never ceased 
its evolution.
Situation 
comedies 
are 
shows that revolve around the 
same 
recurring 
characters 
played by the same actors in 
a shared environment. Over 
the course of their 30-minute 
run-times, weekly conflicts 
are resolved cleanly, bringing 
the show back to its natural 
equilibrium. 
Traditional 
sitcoms are either filmed in 
front of a live studio audience 
or use laugh tracks, but this 
format has been challenged 
as the genre changed over 
time. The constant debate on 
what era of sitcom reigns over 
the others will never find a 
resolution — it’s like comparing 
apples and oranges. Let me 
explain why.
The great majority of ’90s 
sitcom fans will cite classics like 
“Friends,” “Seinfeld” and “The 
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” as the best 
the genre has to offer. They can 
probably recite lines and sing along 
to the theme songs with ease. 
The same goes for 2000s sitcom 
watchers with shows like “The 
Office,” “How I Met Your Mother” 
and 
“Parks 
and 
Recreation.” 
There’s definitely some crossover 
in style between these eras and 
their TV shows, but, over time, 
sitcoms have adapted other genres 
and transformed themselves into a 
modernized new normal, making 
any new or currently running 
sitcoms with a live audience 
or laugh track structure seem 
outdated and often tacky. For 
instance, sitcoms still consist of 
a group of recurring characters 
in 
the 
same 
environment, 
but depending on where the 
environment is and how the show 
is shot makes all the difference 
in how the show’s plot is set up. 
House-based sitcoms will most 
likely be about the nuclear family 
and domestic living, workplace-
based sitcoms will vary more 
but follow along with the lines of 
the struggles of each workplace 
industry, and so on and so forth.
An extremely familiar and 
renowned style of sitcom is the 
mockumentary, 
which 
existed 
long before in movies like “This is 
Spinal Tap,” but was popularized 
with shows like “The Office” and 
“Modern Family.” Its divergence 
from 
the 
multi-camera, 
live 

studio audience is pretty evident, 
and the mockumentary sitcom’s 
development is merely a branch 
off of the classic format — nothing 
more, nothing less. Think about 
it. 
In 
mockumentaries, 
we 
never see the audience, but it’s 
presumed when the characters are 
interviewed by the “camera crews” 
following them. In “The Office,” 
they explicitly mention the release 
of the documentary, and we are 
even able to see a cameraman 
in the later seasons (which is an 
entirely different rabbit hole we 
can’t get into right now). In shows 
like “Modern Family” and “Parks 
and Recreation,” the characters 
make eye contact with the camera 
and have interviews, but nobody 
really mentions why they’re being 
recorded. Nevertheless, they’re 
aware the audience is there. 

Somewhat 
similarly, 
’90s 
sitcoms 
never 
address 
the 
audience 
directly, 
but 
scripts 
and jokes are tailor-made to fit 
between audience responses. The 
environment is nothing like the 
sleek, cinematic atmosphere of 
most modern sitcoms. But to its 
credit, live studio audiences and 
laugh tracks create the perfect 
environment to heighten reactions 
for whatever might be going on in 
the show’s plotline. Depending 
on 
your 
preferences, 
hearing 
audience reactions might be like 
nails on a chalkboard, but I’ve 
found that some people just can’t 
follow quick-witted humor when 
there’s not an audience telling you 
when to laugh. 
I’m not here to judge, but I will 
always reserve a little side-eye for 
people who try and compare the 
different but equally iconic forms 
of ’90s sitcoms and ’00s sitcoms. 
Each come with their own factor 
of nostalgia, which makes it even 
more impossible to objectively 
compare these distant relatives. 
So don’t. Take them as they are 
for what they are — funny shows 
with loveable characters and quick 
resolution.

 —Sophia Yoon, Daily Arts Writer

 
Sitcoms 
are 
a 
timeless 
television staple. From 1946’s 
“Pinwright’s Progress” to the 
comedy powerhouse that was “I 
Love Lucy,” to television’s current 
comedy darling “Master of None,” 
sitcoms have been been around for 

a long time. But if you compare “I 
Love Lucy” to something like “The 
Office,” you might have trouble 
equating them. We might call them 
the same genre, but their forms are 
very different. They reflect the era 
in which they were made — which 
only begs the question, where does 
it go from here?
When you think of a sitcom, you 
probably imagine a very particular 
kind of standard. A multi-camera 
set up with regular locations and 
the almighty laugh track. This 
form has persisted for decades now, 
with classic staples like “Friends,” 
“Seinfeld,” and “Cheers.” But 
these are the sitcoms of old. Our 
modern sitcoms are single-camera 
shows, they move freely between 
locations and are devoid of laugh 
tracks. The camera snaps between 
characters with rapid-fire dialogue 
and subtle jokes. Shows like “30 
Rock,” “Parks and Recreation” 
and “It’s Always Sunny in 
Philadelphia” 
do 
not 
look 
like standard sitcoms. They 
almost look like low-budget 
independent films with their 
low lighting, dark humor and 
shaking cameras.
The modern shows that 
follow the more traditional 
form also seem to get an awful 
lot of flack. Consider “The Big 
Bang Theory.” If you look that 
show up on Google, followed by 
the word “sucks,” you’ll get an 
astounding amount of results. 
Or, how about “Two and a Half 
Men”? How often do you hear 
about that show? 
If the ubiquity of white 
girls with “I love ‘The Office’” 
in their Tinder bios is any 
indication, then our generation 
clearly favors the single-cam 
approach. It seems like the 
evolution of the sitcom is a kind 
of devolution, where the fewer 
the cameras and the more open 
the world onscreen is, the better 
it is for audiences. However, this 
shift makes it difficult to predict 
how the form is supposed to 
progress from here. The multi-
camera, laugh track standard has 
been around for decades, and with 
the relatively new invention of the 
single-camera sitcom, the genre 
shows no signs of departing soon 
from our TV guides. 
I think it’s worth considering 
what the laugh track actually does, 
and perhaps, it will elucidate the 
causes for its decline in popularity. 
It doesn’t just cue viewers into 
the joke. It creates a sense of 
community, a collectivity that just 
isn’t present in single-cam sitcoms. 
If you think about it, single-cam 
shows are kind of lonely. Under 
what circumstances did you last 
watch “Parks and Rec”? Alone, 
in your bed, with the lights off? 
Do we really think laugh tracks 
make us feel stupid, or are we just 
more lonely that we used to be? 
Maybe this trend of single-camera 
shows won’t last. Maybe it’ll fizzle 
out soon. Or maybe it’ll get to the 
point where the only way we can 
connect with a show is by making 
the camera a character — including 
us in the situations, letting us live 
somehow with the characters, 
like a distorted concoction of VR 
and meta-television. I guess the 
answer isn’t so much how sitcoms 
will change, but how sitcoms will 
interact with the overarching 
feelings we project onto them.

If you think about it,

“Parks & Rec”? Alone,

For our discussion of time, 
Senior Arts Editor Samantha 
Della Fera and Daily TV Editor 
Ally Owens discuss the beast that 
is syndication, the cryogenic tank 
of television. Through looking at 
the process behind syndication 
itself, they are better able to 
theorize what privileges certain 
shows to last the test of time, while 
others are forgotten forever.

We’ve all seen the memes. 
Insert clip of someone jumping in 
slow-motion; insert trite caption 
related to being startled awake 
by the unmistakable horns of 
War’s “Low Rider” signaling 
the commencement of the 4:30 
a.m. “George Lopez.” If you 
understand the joke within this 
meme, then there’s a good chance 
you’ve had some sort of contact 
with 
syndicated 
television. 
SYNDICATION: It’s the reason 
why Matthew Perry has been 
able to stave off a middle-class 
existence despite not 
appearing in anything 
of note for over a decade, 
why 
Jerry 
Seinfeld 
is nearly a billionaire 
and why, to this day, 
I hold nothing but an 
irrational 
resentment 
towards the actor who 
played Carl Winslow on 
“Family Matters.”
Using 
industry 
terms, when a television 
show is syndicated, it 
has been specifically 
selected and purchased 
by a television network 
separate 
from 
the 
channel that originally 
aired the program. The 
show then runs on this 
new network at random 
times 
of 
the 
day, 
normally in the gaps 
between daytime and primetime 
or during the graveyard shift 
before the infomercials begin. 
Using layman’s terms, the entire 
process is a bit like the afterlife 
depicted 
in 
“Coco”: 
Those 
that are popular enough to be 
remembered get access to the 
afterlife syndication provides, 
and those that are not … well … 
have you ever heard of “Small 
Wonder”? By the book, it seems 
like a pretty simple process, 
but when I took a step back and 
compared the endless amount of 
television shows produced over 
the years with the oligarchy of 
shows that dominate various 
networks’ syndication rotations, 
I had to wonder what made these 
shows so special. Was there 
someone out there really pushing 
for “The Big Bang Theory” 
to run simultaneously on six 
different networks at 7 p.m. 
on a Wednesday night? What 
prioritizes shows like this over 
“Don’t Trust the B in Apartment 
23?” Just why was I forced to 
spend my childhood pretending 
Dave Coulier was funny on “Full 
House,” when Alanis Morissette 
worked so hard to inform the 
country that he was a mondo 
douche?
The first clue that I received 
on my hunt for answers was a 
concept called the “100-episode” 
rule. 
The 
100-episode 
rule 
decrees that television shows 
must have over 100 episodes in 
their original series run to have 
a better shot at being purchased 
for syndication. Think about 
it: 
A 
show 
like 
“American 

Dad!” with over 256 episodes 
spanning 15 seasons is better 
suited for the basic cable mid-
afternoon 
programming 
lull 
than something like “Freaks and 
Geeks” with only 18 episodes to 
its name. If TBS chose the latter 
over the former for syndication, 
almost weekly, the same episodes 
would air in sequential order. 
Take this from someone who has 
spent many summers parked in 
front of the TV during this block 
— repetition of the same episodes 
is enough to drive someone to 
madness. Or worse, reading a 
book!
In realizing this, it becomes 
very clear that the key to 
syndication lies in how the show 
was received — not by fans — by 
network executives during its 
original run. Big, bloated shows 
like “Friends” are selected for 
syndication because they easily 
have more than 100 episodes to 
its history, but then this presents 

the question of what factors were 
at play to ensure that it continued 
to get renewed during the 1990s? 
It is easy to draw the line between 
length and syndication when 
comparing “Friends” to “Pushing 
Daisies,” but not as clear when 
you compare to two titans such 
as “Friends” to “NYPD Blue.” 
Why is one seen so much for 
frequently than the other?

— Ally Owens, Daily TV Editor

 
Syndication is not always a 
bad thing; I discovered some 
of my favorite shows (“Scrubs” 
binge anyone?) through their 
repeated airings far after the 
last episode premiered live. But 
syndication has become much 
like an annoying public policy 
class — some people take up 
way too much airtime, with 
little or nothing to say. We’ve 
all seen the “pivot” episode of 
“Friends” far too many times 
to find it funny anymore, and 
I can recite entire episodes of 
“Law and Order: SVU” from 
2003 better than I can recite the 
“Star-Spangled Banner.” These 
shows have survived the test of 
time, infiltrating laptop stickers 
and Instagram bios with jokes 
and quotes that should’ve died in 
2004. They’ve been dug up time 
and time again, but what about 
the shows who weren’t given 
enough time? The ones who were 
laid to rest forever? The ones not 
deemed good enough in their 
first runs, catapulting them into 
obscurity for the rest of eternity?

With the exception of “Scrubs” 
and maybe “The Nanny,” some of 
the best shows are those that are 
left alone. This isn’t a snobbish 
declaration that I know what’s 
better for TV more than the 
“common man,” it’s actually quite 
the opposite. Most of the shows 
cancelled or ignored before they 
get their chance to make it big are 
fan and critic favorites — it’s the 
corporations that don’t like them. 
Take “Arrested Development,” 
for example. Seasons one through 
three of the show were wildly 
popular among critics, yet it was 
cancelled due to low viewership 
(partly due to low publicity, as 
the show was slapped with a 
lawsuit in its first season). Yet, 
today “Arrested Development” 
has a cult following.
This example of cancellation 
despite high critical acclaim 
is not exclusive to “Arrested 
Development.” 
Just 
look 
at 
two 
more 
recent 
examples: 
“Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine” 
and “One Day at a Time.” 
“Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine” 
was 
cancelled 
after 
five popular seasons to 
make room for “Bob’s 
Burgers” and “Thursday 
Night 
Football,” 
two 
programs 
that 
FOX 
wanted to prioritize. Yet, 
the cancellation caused 
universal outrage and, in 
an unprecedented move, 
NBC snatched up the 
show barely a day later. 
“One Day at a Time” 
hasn’t been so lucky.
At risk of sounding 
like 
a 
tin-hatter, 
it’s 
interesting that shows 
like 
“Brooklyn 
Nine-
Nine” and “One Day at a 
Time,” two shows praised 
for their diversity, were 
not given the time and effort 
to 
properly 
succeed. 
Much 
like 
“Arrested 
Development,” 
“One Day at a Time” received 
high critical praise and a cult 
following, yet that still wasn’t 
enough to save it. The effects 
of cable syndication has seeped 
into streaming services, as just 
months before Netflix cancelled 
“One Day at a Time,” they spent 
thousands to keep “Friends” 
on the platform. Apparently 
people need to watch Ross and 
Rachel fight for one more time 
and a group of white twenty-
somethings drinking coffee more 
than they care to watch a diverse 
family go through real issues 
with grace and humor. But, that’s 
none of my business.
Does syndication prevent new 
shows from succeeding? No — 
well, not exactly. What it does is 
force outdated casts and humor 
on to audiences. People love 
“The Office” and “Friends,” and 
that’s fine, but watching these 
shows over and over cause them 
to crave material just like them, 
and networks want to feed that 
craving. Critics and audiences 
are telling TV companies what 
they want — they just aren’t 
listening. As hit shows like 
“Broad City,” “Jane the Virgin, 
“Veep” and “Game of Thrones” 
end this year, what is lining up 
to take their place? Society has 
been through enough, another 
repeat of “Friends” just won’t cut 
it anymore.

Many 
people, 
myself 
included, are fascinated by 
home videos. They evoke a 
sense of comfort and wonder. 
They make us consider how 
much we and the people we 
love have changed. In “how we 
live — messages to the family,” 
the final feature film screened 
at last weekend’s 57th Ann 
Arbor Film Festival, Austrian 
director 
Gustav 
Deutsch explores 
the 
beauty 
of 
home 
videos 
as 
an 
art 
form 
with 
remarkable 
compassion.
Deutsch begins 
the film by asking 
his 
audience 
to 
suspend 
their 
disbelief. 
He 
says, 
“Imagine 
we are sitting at 
home, the screen 
is set up, the projector ready 
and we start watching home 
movies together.” He then 
proceeds 
to 
present 
the 
footage, found through film 
archives across the globe, of a 
select few families that come 
from different backgrounds, 
nationalities and time periods, 
all the while commenting on 
the specifics of their lives.
“how we live” doesn’t seize 
you. It doesn’t demand that you 
pay attention to it. It doesn’t 
aspire to entertain. Because 
of this, it’s very easy to detach 
yourself from the images being 

presented. Admittedly, I found 
myself doing this at times. I 
struggled to connect to and 
invest myself in people I’ve 
never met, many of whom are 
long gone. However, there’s 
another, far more interesting 
way to engage with the film 
that I found myself embracing 
by the end of it. You can either 
view the faces and places 
shown on-screen as people 
you never knew and places you 
have never been, or you can 
try to adopt the perspective of 

the person behind the camera, 
someone who sees what they’re 
filming as something worth 
capturing.
In a particularly striking 
piece of film from the 1950s, 
a man on a ship films his wife 
overlooking the New York City 
skyline as they prepare to leave 
for Greece, their homeland. 
She is beautiful and she seems 
happy, but that’s about all 
that can be inferred from the 
footage alone. However, when 
you consider the image from 
the perspective of a husband 
in love, everything changes. 

“How We Live” is a myriad 
of moments just like this. In 
understanding that the people 
captured in these videos were 
once alive, with thoughts and 
feelings just like our own, we 
come to love them. Deutsch 
challenges us to practice our 
own empathy, to try our best 
to care about people and places 
we will never know ourselves.
Despite 
being 
an 
active 
participant 
in 
it, 
I 
often 
find 
myself 
criticizing 
my 
generation’s 
relationship 
with 
technology 
and its devotion 
to 
broadcasting 
all aspects of life 
on social media. 
After seeing “how 
we live,” my view 
has been altered. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
breakthroughs 
in 
technology, 
we’ve been given 
the wholly unique 
ability to capture 
our 
experiences 
with our phones and share 
them 
with 
others 
with 
unprecedented ease. And even 
though the majority of us will 
almost inevitably be forgotten 
by history, documenting the 
parts of our lives that best 
represent who we were and 
what we felt is our closest 
chance to becoming immortal. 
Perhaps one day a filmmaker 
from the future will want to 
resurrect us from the past and 
show the world how we lived. 
By acting as documentarians 
of our lives now, we can give 
them the chance.

‘how we live’ is a waltz

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘DOWNHILL LULLABY’

After a nearly six-year 
hiatus, 
Sky 
Ferreira 
has 
returned 
with 
the 
new 
single “Downhill Lullaby” 
from a forthcoming 
untitled 
studio 
album. This time, 
she 
has 
forsaken 
her typical synthy 
production 
and 
uptempo rhythm in 
favor 
of 
haunting 
strings and a dark, 
rolling 
bass 
line. 
It is a downbeat 
and 
atmospheric 
track 
that 
toes 
the 
line 
between 
being a slow burner 
and being a dirge, 
almost redolent of 
Lana Del Rey — a far cry 
from the grungy electropop 
of Night Time, My Time. 
The highlight of the song is 
the surreal, swelling string 
arrangement, 
performed 

by 
Danish 
violinist 
Nils 
Gröndahl.
The song was co-produced 
by the “Twin Peaks” music 

supervisor 
Dean 
Hurley, 
which is fitting given its 
Lynchian, 
“out-of-time” 
feeling and foreboding tone 
(Ferreira cameoed in “Twin 
Peaks: The Return” a year 

ago). It is not a pop song — 
it’s not exactly hummable, 
and it’s certainly not catchy. 
It feels as though it would be 
best listened to late 
at night at a point 
in your life when 
everything 
feels 
wrong.
It 
is 
pleasant 
as a one-off, but 
an 
album 
full 
of 
“Downhill Lullaby”-
style tracks would 
quickly 
turn 
into 
a 
slog. 
Luckily, 
Ferreira has stated 
that the rest of her 
upcoming 
project 
will be more poppy 
— but it remains to 
be seen whether it will be as 
bold.

After a long break, “Game of 
Thrones” will return to HBO in 
a few weeks for its final season. 
The first four episodes will clock 
in at 54, 58, 60 and 70 minutes, 
respectively. The final two are 
slated at 80 minutes each. “It’s 
a spectacle,” the chairman of 
HBO told Variety in January. 
“The guys have done six movies. 
The reaction I had while 
watching them was, ‘I’m 
watching a movie.’ ” The 
slight 
wrinkle 
in 
this 
compliment was that the 
guys in question — that 
is, 
showrunners 
David 
Benioff and D.B. Weiss — 
had already said at a panel 
years 
before 
that 
they 
saw their series not as a 
television show, and not 
as a collection of movies, 
but rather as one grand 
73-hour movie. 
This sort of thinking 
has suddenly become very 
en vogue among the prestige TV 
creative class. Television that 
aspires to the long, cinematic and 
amorphous is now considered 
nothing less than a hallmark 
of genius. And freed from the 
traditional 
mindset 
of 
the 
medium, with the gates of cinema 
in sight, what’s to stop episodes of 
television from creeping slowly 
past the hour mark and toward 
90-minute territory? 
The appeal of the streaming 
age is that it has made obsolete 
the less savory constraints of 
television. A show no longer 

needs to be 22 or 45 minutes 
because 
there’s 
nothing 
necessarily scheduled to come 
before or after it; it exists in its 
own space. Scripts and scenes 
don’t have to be timed for act 
breaks anymore because there 
are no ads. No advertisements 
means no advertisers, and thus 
no need for creators to hew to 
the plots and characters and 
premises 
that 
conventional 
wisdom dictates will win over 
the most viewers. In many ways, 

this is a good thing — without 
these developments, we don’t 
end up with “Orange is the New 
Black” or “Shrill” or “BoJack 
Horseman.” It is a kind of radical 
conceit: art for art’s sake. Art 
that doesn’t have to mold itself to 
network contours. Art made just 
because it can be made.
And artistic freedom is great, 
sure. But with great power 
comes great responsibility. For 
every Dalí painting there is an 
“Episode I: Phantom Menace.” 
For every Mahler symphony, 
a (shudder) montage set to 

“Fix You” by Coldplay on “The 
Newsroom.” Just because you 
can do something doesn’t mean 
you should. There is — believe it 
or not — value in constraint and 
discipline. Maybe in theory there 
are circumstances in which it’s 
appropriate for an episode to 
run 70 minutes long, but if “Mad 
Men” could lay bare the show’s 
central relationship in one utterly 
perfect 48-minute episode, if 
“The Good Place” can upend its 
entire plot and sprinkle in some 
eschatological ruminations 
in 22 minutes every week, 
I’m having a difficult time 
imagining 
what 
exactly 
those circumstances are. 
There has always been 
a lot of handwringing in 
the art world about the 
relationship 
between 
content 
and 
form. 
Are 
they distinct elements? Is 
the message inextricable 
from the messenger? There 
are no easy answers here, 
except that when you’re 
making television, both of 
them are very important. 
Cable and streaming shows these 
days deal in profound ideas and 
metaphors, and when done well, 
they are moving and beautiful 
and impossible not to appreciate. 
But when the pacing is sluggish, 
when the scenes feel a slog, when 
you are angrily checking your 
watch and wondering why HBO 
spends so much money on CGI-
ing dragons and not, say, on one 
editor, the profundity is all for 
naught. I love TV that challenges, 
that experiments and subverts. 
More importantly, though, I love 
TV that ends. 

Your television show does 
not need to be as long as it is

At end of season, Poole carries weight of unfulfilled expectations

As Jordan Poole sat by his 
locker on the eve of Michigan’s 
NCAA 
Tournament 
opener 
against Montana two weeks ago, 
the questions flowed toward 
the sophomore forward. They 
always do, positive or negative.
This 
time 
— 
three 
days 
removed 
from 
Poole 
not 
speaking 
with 
media 
after 
his 
3-for-11 
performance in 
the Wolverines’ 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
title game loss 
to 
Michigan 
State 
— 
they 
were 
negative, 
ranging from his shot selection 
down the stretch against the 
Spartans to his mood amid a 
season filled with personal ups 
and downs.
Eventually, Poole had enough.
“We lost five games,” he said. 
“What have we lost, five or six? 
It felt like all hell broke loose, 
right? Won 28 games? Welcome 
to 
college 
basketball. 
Think 
about that. Won 28 games, lost 
six and it feels like the world’s 
about to fall down.”
This is who Poole is — at 
least outwardly. He’s carefree 
and habitually rejects anything 
negative, or so 
his persona will 
tell you.
But two days 
before 
Poole’s 
dismissive 
answers 
filled 
that locker room 
in Des Moines, 
Iowa, 
Jim 
Gosz, his high 
school 
coach 
at Rufus King 
in Milwaukee, sang a different 
tune.
“He’s pissed off,” Gosz told 
The Daily. “It’s a scary thought, 
too, because when he’s pissed off, 

he delivers down the stretch.”
Within the Michigan team, 
though, 
there 
was 
a 
pre-
packaged 
dismissal 
of 
any 
mention of Poole’s struggles.
When a reporter asked John 
Beilein about his frustration 
with Poole against Michigan 
State — the Michigan coach 
had spent Sunday afternoon in 
Chicago shaking his head and 
slamming 
the 
floor with each 
ill-advised shot — 
his response was 
denial.
“You 
or 
I? 
I never said I 
wasn’t 
pleased 
with his plays,” 
Beilein said. “… 
If 
you’re 
mind 
readers, 
you’re 
mind readers.”
Ignas 
Brazdeikis, 
too, 
claimed ignorance when asked 
about Poole’s struggles. Isaiah 
Livers, typically an open book, 
dismissed it as something “that’s 
gonna come with the game of 
basketball.”
And at the time, Michigan 
could ignore Poole’s struggles, 
despite a preseason in which 
Beilein pegged him as its sole 
elite shooter, pinning him with 
the expectations of replacing its 
three best deep threats. He had 
shot just 30 percent from three 
over the final two months of 
Big Ten play as the Wolverines 
squandered 
regular-season 
and 
tournament 
Big 
Ten 
titles 
while losing all 
three 
meetings 
with 
Michigan 
State. But none 
of 
that 
really 
matters 
if 
you 
deliver in March, 
a 
lesson 
that 
Poole, built on the 
legend of one immortalized shot 
against Houston last postseason, 
knows better than anyone.
“He has such a short-term 
memory, 
where 
whatever 

happened in the last game, he’s 
gonna correct it this game,” Gosz 
said on Mar. 4. “That’s why I 
can’t wait to see what they do, 
cause I think Michigan’s gonna 
be a tough out. … I 
have them to win 
it.”
For two games, 
Gosz’ 
prediction 
came to fruition, 
as Poole left Des 
Moines with 29 
points 
in 
two 
games, 
helping 
send 
Michigan 
to 
consecutive 
double-digit wins 
and its third-straight Sweet 
Sixteen.
Then came Thursday night in 
Anaheim.
Poole, in 31 minutes, finished 

with just eight points. None of 
his three 3-pointers fell and the 
Wolverines were sent packing 
with a 63-44 loss to Texas Tech, 
just 30 miles from the building 
where they cut 
down the West 
Regional nets a 
year ago.
After 
the 
game, his ever-
present 
smile 
was locked shut, 
eyes red with 
the receipts of 
recently-dried 
tears as he tried 
to purvey his 
signature optimism.
“Obviously in this current 
moment, we lost and we definitely 
still want to be playing,” Poole 
said. “But you can’t change the 

fact that we won 17 games in a 
row or had a top-two defense in 
the country or won 30 games in 
the season. There’s so much to 
look back at stuff like that.”
Livers 
confirmed 
that 
his 
postgame 
message 
to 
Poole 
would 
be one of a 
proud friend. 
Poole, Livers 
said, 
had 
played a good 
season, fixing 
the defensive 
issues that had kept him off the 
floor in his freshman year.
But 
when 
the 
cameras 
turned 
off 
and 
the 
media 
departed, Livers’ message was 

no consolation. As the last of 
the reporters trickled out of 
Michigan’s locker room, assistant 
coach DeAndre Haynes — done 
with his media responsibility — 
made his way over to 
Poole.
Haynes, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
go-to 
players 
coach, 
appeared to offer 
up a few words of 
support. But Poole, 
head wrapped in one 
last March Madness 
towel 
and 
eyes 
buried in Haynes’ 
shoulder, 
had 
no 
need for words. His trademark 
optimism, pervasive to the last 
possible moment, was gone, 
replaced by the tears of unfilled 
expectations.

Rockets bottled

Wolverines extend winning streak to six, dominate Toledo, 8-2, in tune-up for series against Minnesota this weekend

Jeff Criswell’s attempt at 
a spotless night was over in 
the first inning. With one out, 
Toledo’s Brad Boss managed to 
squeeze a single through the 
right side of the infield. Then, 
as the Rockets’ Chris Meyers 
swung six inches below junior 
right-hander 
Criswell’s 
high 
fastball, Boss beat catcher Joe 
Donovan’s throw to second base 
by mere milliseconds.
The 
defense’s 
busy 
first 
inning would set the tone 
for the rest of 
Wednesday 
evening 
as 
a 
carousel 
of 
Michigan 
pitchers 
took 
the 
mound 
against Toledo.
For Criswell, 
his 
pitches 
ranged 
from 
unhittable 
to 
Little 
League 
— in the second inning, he 
allowed a single and a walk 
to put two runners on with no 
outs. After a quick strikeout 

and a groundout, he walked 
the Rockets’ nine-hole hitter 
Thomas Eitniear to load the 
bases, only to come back and 
entice Boss to swing past a 
bullet of a fastball.
Criswell 
— 
a 
weekend 
starter who missed a game last 
Sunday against Michigan State 
after it was suspended — was 
pulled after two innings. His 
replacement was freshman left-
hander Walker Cleveland, who 
promptly let up a single.
An error by senior second 
baseman Ako Thomas on a 
fielder’s choice would extend 
the 
inning, 
allowing 
a 
sacrifice 
bunt 
and 
a 
ground 
out 
to 
push 
Toledo’s 
John 
Servello 
from 
second base to 
home, 
scoring 
an unearned run 
— the Rockets’ 
first run of the 
game.
The next inning was smooth 
sailing for Cleveland with one 
strikeout and two first-pitch 
groundouts, closing his two-

inning term as president of the 
mound. Now, it was freshman 
right-hander 
Isaiah 
Paige’s 
opportunity to give the defense 
some work.
“We had some momentum 
plays on defense, some ball 
security plays,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “We’ve been 
talking about ball security, 
playing fast, accurate catch and 
just taking care of the baseball.”
The first batter, Servello, 
punched a clear, clean single to 
left-center field. Facing the next 
batter, Paige gave sophomore 
shortstop Jack Blomgren an 
opportunity to make a web 
gem-esque play, but despite 
Blomgren’s best efforts, Meyers 
beat the throw. Fortunately for 
Paige, his next gift to the defense 
was accepted wholeheartedly — 
a clean 5-4-3 double play ended 
the threatening inning.
“Our pitchers do a really 
good 
job 
of 
attacking 
the 
strike zone and keeping our 
defense engaged as defenders 
and make those plays,” Bakich 
said. “It’s always nice when we 
can make the web gem plays 
or turn a double play, it turns 
the momentum for ourselves 
offensively the next inning.”
Continuing to follow the rule 
of two, Paige returned for the 
sixth inning. Allowing a leadoff 
single just past a diving senior 
third baseman Blake Nelson 
and following it up with a 
passed ball to advance Toledo’s 
Darryn Davis, putting him in 
perfect position to score off the 
next single.
Only 
when 
junior 
right-
hander 
Jack 
Weisenburger 
came into the game did the 
defense have the opportunity to 
breathe in a one-two-three top 
of the seventh.
It 
was 
clear 
today 
that 
Michigan’s defense was hard 
to break, no matter how much 
it bent. There were 15 ground-
outs and just two fly-outs, 
holding the Rockets to two 
runs. While none of the pitchers 
on Wednesday threw gems, the 
defense stepped up and had a 
gem of its own.

Wednesday’s 
matchup 
against Toledo was supposed to 
be a tune-up for the Michigan 
baseball team as they head into 
a big weekend series against 
Minnesota. 
That’s 
exactly 
what it was. 
Behind strong a defensive 
performance and consistently 
solid 
pitching 
out 
of 
the 
bullpen, 
the 
Wolverines 
rolled past the Rockets to a 
comfortable 8-2 victory.
“I thought all the pitchers 
that got in there today did 
fine,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “We played good 
defense, and we got some 
timely hits. We were able to 
put the pressure on them with 
some stolen bases. We created 
some scoring opportunities. 
Overall, it wasn’t our best day, 
but we’ll certainly take it.”
The 
game 
stayed 
close 
through 
the 
first 
three 
innings, but Michigan got on 
the board first in the bottom 
of the second. Redshirt senior 
left 
fielder 
Miles 
Lewis 
reached on a single to left field, 
and eventually came home 
on a single from sophomore 
shortstop Jack Blomgren. 
Toledo answered with a run 
of its own in the top of the third 
inning. John Servello reached 
first 
on 
a 
leadoff 
single, 
and after staying alive on a 
throwing error from senior 
second baseman Ako Thomas 
and taking third on a sacrifice 
bunt from Trace Hatfield, he 
scored on an RBI groundout 
from Darryn Davis.
The 
Wolverines 
were 
unshaken, though. Freshman 
left-hander Walker Cleveland 
ended the inning on the next 
batter he faced, and sophomore 
catcher Joe Donovan homered 
to lead off the bottom of the 
third inning, putting Michigan 
back on top. Cleveland then 
retired the side in the top of 
the fourth as the Wolverines’ 
defense faultlessly backed him 
up.

“I just trust my pitchers 
to 
get 
me 
ground 
balls,” 
Blomgren said. “I just try to 
make the plays most of the 
time, try to limit my errors as 
much as possible, and thank 
my pitchers for giving me 
ground balls.”
In the bottom of the fourth 
inning, the Wolverines broke 
the game open. After Michigan 
loaded 
the 
bases, 
Brewer 
scored on a wild pitch. Senior 
first baseman Jimmy Kerr 
and Blomgren each notched 
RBI, scoring Lewis and senior 
third baseman Blake Nelson, 
respectively.
The Rockets 
showed 
some 
fight in the top 
of 
the 
fifth, 
putting 
two 
runners 
on 
base off a pair 
of singles from 
Servello 
and 
Chris Meyers, 
but 
redshirt 
freshman 
right-hander Walker Cleveland 
calmly got the Wolverines 
out of the inning without any 
additional damage.
“We did have some good 
momentum plays on defense,” 
Bakich said. “It’s just ball 
security. We’ve been talking a 
lot about ball security, playing 
fast, accurate catch and just 
taking care of the baseball.”
In 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
fifth, Michigan held onto its 
momentum. 
After 
singling 
to right and stealing second, 
sophomore designated hitter 
Jordan Nwogu scored on a 
base hit from Brewer, who 
then stole second and scored 
on a wild pitch. After three 
straight walks, right-hander 
Kyle Bischoff hit Blomgren to 
score Lewis, bringing the score 
to 8-1.
Toledo 
took 
advantage 
when redshirt freshman right-
hander Isaiah Paige struggled 
in the bottom of the sixth 
as Davis singled, advancing 
on a passed ball by Donovan 
before scoring off a single 

from second baseman Riley 
Campbell. But the Wolverines 
ended the inning as sophomore 
left-hander 
Angelo 
Smith 
struck out two Rocket batters 
and forced a third to ground 
out.
After a virtual offensive 
take-off in the middle of the 
game, both teams settled down 
in the last third of the game; 
the last three innings were 
scoreless.
The Wolverines will now 
look ahead to their weekend 
series against Minnesota, likely 
their 
toughest 
competition 
in the Big Ten, 
and one of the 
more 
difficult 
matchups 
of 
their season.
“It’ll 
be 
a 
big 
challenge 
for us,” Bakich 
said. 
“Against 
a 
great 
team 
like Minnesota, 
it’s 
going 
to 
come down to 
pitching, defense and timely 
hitting, so the team that plays 
the best is going to come away 
with the series this weekend.”

Sophomore guard Jordan Poole struggled to maintain consistency this season, despite occasionally meeting high expectations placed on him in the fall.

change the fact 
that we won 17 
games in a row.

You or I? I 
never said I 
wasn’t pleased 
with his plays.

We lost and 
we definitely 
still want to be 
playing.

That’s gonna 
come with 
the game of 
basketball.

Notebook: Harbaugh details spring depth chart, updates on injuries

About five minutes into his 
press conference Wednesday 
morning, Jim Harbaugh was 
asked about Ben VanSumeran. 
Questions about younger guys 
— in this case, a sophomore 
running back who appeared 
in four games last season, 
narrowly avoiding a redshirt — 
are what spring pressers are for. 
Hype builds and, most often, 
recedes by the time the season 
gets underway. The media tries 
to figure out the depth chart, 
and who’s playing where.
In the case of Michigan 
football under Harbaugh, the 
operative word in that sentence 
has been tries.
Harbaugh 
is 
famously 
secretive, rarely forthcoming. 
He dismisses questions about 
injuries. When an outlet tried 
to file a Freedom of Information 
Request to figure out the most 
basic of things: the roster, 
before the 2017 season, it was 
stonewalled. A depth chart has 
long been considered out of the 
question. Let alone as a response 
to a question that didn’t ask for 
it.
“I would call it a hybrid in the 
sense that a tailback can also 
be an H-back,” Harbaugh said 
of VanSumeran’s position. “But 
he is definitely cemented in the 
running back rotation as well.”
Then he kept going.
“Right now Tru Wilson is 
the starter (at running back). 
Julian Garrett’s backing up or 
— Ben VanSumeren’s the backup 
tailback right now, second team, 
then Julian. Nick Capatina is a 
person who tried out who’s in 
school here and tried out and 
looks like he’s making the team.
“Christian Turner is—I think 
we’ll have Christian back either 
this Sunday or by the following 
Friday practice, so Christian 
should make it back for four 
or five practices. He had a soft 
tissue, hamstring, early on in 
practice, like day two. But he’s 

progressing well.
“Hassan Haskins has also 
been limited this spring. He has 
a prior meniscus that’s—trying 
to get through what he can in 
spring ball, and so far it’s been 
a couple practices. May make it 
back for some practices toward 
the end but I think he’s gonna 
need a procedure when spring 
football practice is over. Zach 
Charbonnet is coming along 
really well. He had an existing 
injury coming out of high school 
that was fixed when he got here 
in January. Not going to be able 
to do any spring ball this session 
but he’ll be back and will do 
fine.”
Got that? Good, because it 
wasn’t the end. By the end, 
Harbaugh 
had 
noted 
Lucas 
Andrighetto’s ACL tear, as well 
as the sophomore’s achievements 
in his high school championship 
game. Andrighetto, mind you, 
played zero games last year, and 
likely wouldn’t this year even if 
healthy.
By the end, Harbaugh had 
been talking for 10 minutes 
straight, touching on seven 
different positional groups and 
giving a verbal depth chart for 
each of them.
Offensive line
No 
surprises 
here. 
The 
Wolverines return four starters 
— Jon Runyan Jr., Ben Bredeson, 
Cesar 
Ruiz 
and 
Michael 
Onwenu, from left to right — 
and according to Harbaugh, 
they will remain the starters.
At 
right 
tackle, 
where 
Michigan 
is 
looking 
for 
a 
replacement for the graduated 
Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty, 
Harbaugh said junior Andrew 
Stueber and sophomore Jalen 
Mayfield are “neck and neck.”
Still, for a unit that was a 
constant source of questions last 
year, this is a welcome calm.
“We’ve got the guys all around 
and one of the things that we 
really have is an offensive line 
that can drive our offense,” 
said offensive coordinator Josh 
Gattis on Mar. 22. “I would 

say that’s the strength of our 
offense right now.”
Wide receiver
If the offensive line looks 
every bit as expected, the 
receiving corps is the complete 
opposite. 
Harbaugh 
named 
early 
enrollee 
Mike Sainristil, 
junior 
Oliver 
Martin 
and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Tarik 
Black 
as the current 
starters.
That 
comes 
with 
some 
injury 
caveats 
— junior Nico 
Collins, the Wolverines’ leading 
receiver last season, is rehabbing 
from surgery, per Harbaugh, 
and progressing well. Things 
may not be quite as good for 
Donovan Peoples-Jones.
The junior is dealing with 

a 
soft-tissue 
groin 
injury, 
according 
to 
Harbaugh, 
that’s lingering longer than 
the 
program 
anticipated. 
Harbaugh 
grouped 
Peoples-
Jones in with defensive tackle 
Michael Dwumfour as having, 
“more 
serious 
injuries 
than 
we 
previously 
thought,” 
saying 
they 
could 
potentially 
miss 
game-time.
It 
does, 
however, 
seem 
that 
Sainristil’s 
chances of getting 
on the field are 
very much real.
“He has a level of quickness, 
change of direction, speed,” 
Harbaugh said. “Been really 
eye-opening and really good for 
the team.”
Defensive line
With 
Dwumfour’s 
injury 

potentially 
lasting 
into 
the 
season, 3-technique becomes a 
question in need of an answer. 
For now, Harbaugh is turning 
to junior Donovan Jeter, who he 
says, “appears hellbent on being 
the starting defensive tackle,” 
though Ben Mason has gotten in 
the mix as well.
The rest of the front four 
— Aidan Hutchinson, Carlo 
Kemp and Kwity Paye — seem 
fairly 
set, 
though 
there 
is 
some fluctuation amongst the 
backups. In addition to Mason, 
Harbaugh named Mazi Smith, 
Luiji Vilain, Julius Welschof, 
Taylor 
Upshaw 
and 
Gabe 
Newburg as players competing 
for time.
Notes
• 
Harbaugh named the 
current quarterback depth chart 
last week: Shea Patterson, Dylan 
McCaffrey and Joe Milton, and 
it remains unchanged.
• 
Unsurprisingly, 
Sean 

McKeon and Nick Eubanks are 
the current starters at tight end.
• 
Right now, Josh Uche, 
Devin Gil and Josh Ross lead the 
two-deep at Sam, Will and Mike 
linebackers, respectively.
• 
Quinn 
Nordin 
and 
Jake Moody, who took the 
starting kicking job at the end 
of last season, are in a tight 
competition for the role this 
season.
• 
Peoples-Jones 
and 
Dwumfour are the only injuries 
deemed serious by Harbaugh. 
Cornerback 
Lavert 
Hill 
is 
currently rehabbing from a 
procedure, Harbaugh said, but 
may be able to make it back for 
some of spring ball.
• 
With Hill out, Vince 
Gray 
is 
starting 
at 
corner 
alongside 
Ambry 
Thomas, 
with Brad Hawkins at nickel. 
Harbaugh also named Josh 
Metellus and J’Marick Woods 
as the two starting safeties.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh gave updates on the Wolverines’ depth chart and various injuries during his press conference on Wednesday morning.

We really have ... 
an offensive line 
that can drive 
our offense.

Wolverines crush Toledo, 24-3

Early in the first inning, 
senior 
first 
baseman 
Alex 
Sobczak hit a line drive single 
to right field to move senior 
second baseman Faith Canfield 
to home plate.
And the runs kept coming.
With 13 walks and 12 hits for 
the No. 23 Michigan softball 
team, the Wolverines shredded 
Toledo on Wednesday, 24-3, 
running through the batting 
order almost four times in the 
first two innings alone to win 
by run rule. By the end of the 
second inning, several walks 
with bases loaded resulted in 
more runs than hits and a 19-0 
lead for Michigan.
Starting the game with a big 
first inning, the Wolverines 
ran through the batting order, 
with four walks contributing 
to six runs on the inning. But 
Michigan’s avalanche of runs 
didn’t take shape until, up 2-0 
off a walk that forced senior 
outfielder Natalie Peters home, 
junior Haley Hoogenraad hit a 
ground ball to third base. The 
Rockets’ third baseman tossed 
the ball to the catcher, who 
dropped it, allowing Sobczak 
to slide home on the error, 
along with senior Mackenzie 
Nemitz. A line drive hit by 

senior 
Faith 
Canfield 
also 
increased the score to 6-0.
“We took advantage of 23 
free bases,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “You 
can score six runs in the first 
inning and not score again, 
so it doesn’t necessarily carry 
over, but as you have runs on 
the board, your hitters can be a 
little more loose and confident 
and not feel that pressure and 
get tight, so you see some of 
that.”
But the day’s real highlight 
was the second inning.
After 
freshman 
Lexie 
Blair hit a fly ball for the 
inning’s first out and Sobczak 
slammed a double into center 
field, Toledo’s pitcher walked 
Nemitz, 
foreshadowing 
the 
end of the inning.
Though 
junior 
Haley 
Hoogenraad hit a line drive for 
two RBI, the Wolverines’ next 
six runs all came in on walks 
or players hit by pitches with 
bases loaded.
During 
the 
onslaught, 
Hutchins started putting in 
bench players, and freshman 
catcher 
Hannah 
Carson 
stepped to the plate. For her 
first home run as a Wolverine, 
Carson blasted a grand slam 
to right-center field to empty 
the loaded bases and move the 
lead to 19-0. As she rounded 

the bases, Hutchins threw an 
M&M at her.
“I didn’t know at first 
because it was a low line drive, 
but then when I saw it go out I 
was just super excited because 
I’d never hit a grand slam 
before,” Carson said. “It was 
really exciting.”
Even after that monster 
inning, 
Michigan’s 
power 
didn’t diminish. For her first 
college home run, freshman 
infielder Gianna Carosone hit 
a flyout. Hits by Hoogenraad 
and Carson brought the score 
after the third inning to 24-0.
And the defense thrived 
as well as the offense. Before 
leaving the game after the 
third inning, freshman right-
hander Alex Storako allowed 
no hits.
After the bench took over 
the infield, Michigan allowed 
three runs and scored none 
in the fourth inning, but the 
win nonetheless remained a 
blowout.
“I told them to come back 
tomorrow and be ready for a 
hard practice because I like 
confidence, but you don’t want 
to get soft,” Hutchins said. “I 
love home runs, but it’s just fun 
that everybody but (sophomore 
left-hander Meghan Beaubien) 
got in that game and held their 
own and did well.”
