Protesters interrupt 
Michigan Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) during 
his remarks at the

MACKINAW CITY, Mich. — 

Chanting “Shut down Line 5” in 
the direction of Mackinac Island, 

protesters of the Pipe Up, Pipe Out, 
Shut Down Line 5 Rally assembled 
in Conkling Heritage Park — next 
to the ferry livery — in hopes 
of influencing policy makers to 
remove Pipeline 5.

Members of the Oil and Water 

Don’t Mix Coalition gathered with 
the Food and Water Watch, Clean 
Water Action, the Little River 
Band of Ottawa Indians, the Lit-
tle Traverse Bay Band of Ottawa 
Indians, the Northern Michigan 
Environmental Action Council, 
the Michigan Student Power Net-
work and Concerned Citizens of 

Cheboygan and Emmet County. 
Together, they were a group of 
over 100 from across the state, the 
majority coming from the Tra-
verse City area.

Built in 1953 by Enbridge, 

Pipeline 5 sits in the Straits of 
Mackinac and, at the time of its 
construction, was projected to 
have a lifespan of 40 to 50 years. 
Sixty-two years later, these groups 
fear there will be an oil spill in the 
Great Lakes. For protesters like 
Lynna Kaucheck of the Food and 
Water Watch, the dire situation 
seems imminent.

“With the oil spill in Santa Bar-

bara making headlines, and the 
community there and the environ-
ment there begin on a long road to 
recovery, today is a really impor-
tant time and opportunity for us 
to talk about our pipeline infra-
structure right here in Michigan,” 
Kaucheck said. “When it comes to 
Line 5, it’s not a question of if the 
pipeline will fail, but when.”

Kaucheck said she believes the 

likelihood of a spill is increased 
because of another Enbridge spill 
that occurred in the Great Lakes

Michigan baseball wins Big Ten Tournament

BASEBALL

Clinches postseason 
for first time since 

2008 

By ZACH SHAW

Managing Sports Editor

MINNEAPOLIS — Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich was missing all 
the fun. 

Doing 
post-game 
interviews 

while the team’s celebration moved 
to the outfield, the Michigan base-

ball team shouted for its leader. 
Bakich eventually headed toward 
the heart of Target Field’s outfield. 

Much like his team, he picked up 

steam the closer he got to the cel-
ebration, eventually working into 
a full sprint that could rival the 
Wolverines’ five straight wins over 
NCAA Tournament teams to end 
the season. 

But he wasn’t done yet, and nei-

ther is Michigan.

Seeing the “2015 Big Ten Cham-

pions” banner held by his team, 
Bakich lunged into a headfirst 

slide, dousing his brand-new cham-
pionship T-Shirt in the rain-soaked 
grass before sliding right into posi-
tion for the photo. 

Safe.
Michigan’s coach made it into 

the photo, and the Wolverines 
(14-10 Big Ten, 37-23 overall) have 
secured a spot in their first NCAA 
Tournament in seven years. 

Sophomore left-handed start-

ing pitcher Brett Adcock earned 
his third win in eight days, junior 
right-hander Jacob Cronenworth 
earned his fourth save of the four-

game tournament and Michigan 
— seen as the only one of the eight 
tournament teams that didn’t have 
a chance to make the NCAA Tour-
nament — took down Maryland, 
4-3, and is a champion once again.

***
“I’m so proud,” said Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich. “I’m so proud 
for our kids, proud for this pro-
gram — standing on 148 years of 
baseball tradition with a lot of 
great men and a lot of great teams 
that have come before us. Our guys

New data science 
major to launch 
in fall semester 

Faculty members 

estimate 150 

students will declare 

the major by 2019

By SAM COREY

For the Daily

The 
University 
estab-

lished a new data science 
major, which will be sub-
sumed under LSA’s Statis-
tics Department and the 
College 
of 
Engineering’s 

Division of Computer Sci-
ence and Engineering. The 
new major will be available 
in Fall 2015 to both LSA and 
Engineering students.

According 
to 
Atul 

Prakash, professor of elec-
trical engineering and com-
puter science, working to 
craft a data science major 
has been a joint effort for 
several years.

“(The) 
Department 
of 

Statistics 
and 
Computer 

Science 
and 
Engineering 

(CSE) Division have been 
collaborating for close to a 
decade on curriculum inno-
vation and both programs 
observed that there is going 
to be a need for majors that 
have strong foundations in 
both computing and statis-
tics to help drive data-driv-
en knowledge discovery in a 
wide range of fields includ-
ing medical sciences and 
healthcare, transportation, 
robotics, insurance, social 
networks, natural scienc-
es and other engineering 
fields,” Prakash said in an 
e-mail interview.

The new program will 

include theory and prac-
tice from disciplines such 
as statistics, computer sci-
ence, math and information 
science.

Vijay Nair, professor of 

statistics as well as indus-
trial and operations engi-
neering, said in an e-mail 
interview that the cross-
discipline focus is neces-
sary to adequately prepare 
students for the “big data 
phenomenon” 
that 
will 

drive the work environ-
ment.

“Massive amounts of data 

are now collected routine-
ly in all areas: science and 
technology, business, medi-
cine and daily applications 
(Facebook, Twitter, smart 
phones, World Wide Web, 
etc.). We are seeing a huge 
demand for data scientists, 
people who have the skills 
to work with massive data-
bases — manage, analyze 
and transform data into 
useful information quickly 
in order to make critical 
decisions.”

Nair said data science 

is becoming more vital in 
the corporate and medical 
world.

“Most companies are rely-

ing more and more on data 
for their business, and even 
hospitals, governments and 
research institutions will 
need people with skills in 
data science,” he said. “To 
name a few: Google, Micro-
soft, Facebook, LinkedIn; 
Amazon, IBM, SAS; Banks 
and Financial Institutions 
such as Citibank, Bank of 
America, Capital One, and 
so on. A recent report esti-
mated that, by 2018, the 
demand for Data Scientists 
will be close to 500,000 and 
there will be a shortfall of 
about 150,000 people with 
the right skills.”

According to Nair, data 

science 
faculty 
members 

have 
estimated 
that 
by 

2019, 150 students will have 
declared the major.

Detroit resident Jamisha Kearney remembers the Black women and girls 
who have lost their lives to police brutality and state violence at the #Say-
HerName Silent Protest: National Day of Action for Black Women and Girls 
in front of the Washtenaw County Circuit Court on Thursday.

PROTEST FOR SOCIAL J USTICE


safety the Sierra Club and Clean 
Water Action created with several 
Michigan Representatives, includ-
ing Jeff Irwin (D–Ann Arbor). He 
said he is hopeful for future invest-
ment in renewable resources that 
will help mitigate the dependence 
on oil.

“We know that we can do more 

to protect our air and water by 
investing in renewable energy 
technology,” Clark said as the pro-
testers cheered, “and so we need 
more investments like that in the 
state of Michigan.”

Kaucheck emphasized that an 

oil spill affects more areas than 
the environment and discussed the 
effects a spill would have on public 
health. Sprag talked about how an 
oil spill would impact the economy.

“A spill here puts longstand-

ing economies at risk. It puts the 
economy we share together at risk. 
It puts this great part of the world, 
with 20 percent of the world’s 
freshwater, at risk,” Sprag said. 
“We do not need oil cleanup jobs, 
we do not need respiratory special-
ist jobs at the hospital, we need jobs 
to pull out that pipeline. We need to 
rethink our economy. We need to 
get this thing back on track.”

At 3 p.m., the protesters all 

called Snyder’s office with their 
grievances in an effort to overflow 
his phone lines.

U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D–Mich.) 

did not attend the protest but heard 
of it while at the Policy Conference 
on Mackinac Island. Peters, who 
sits on the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee, which oversees the federal 
agency that oversees pipelines, said 
he sympathizes with the protesters

Poll finds implications on child mental health

Mott’s survey 

finds 60 percent of 
parents fail to report 

severe emotional 

behavior in children

By SANJAY REDDY

Daily Staff Reporter

For years, there has been a 

stigma associated with behav-
ioral and emotional issues such 
as temper tantrums, anxiety, 
homework trouble and attention 
deficit. In particular, parents 

sometimes are reluctant to dis-
cuss these issues with medical 
personnel when their children 
exhibit such behaviors. A new 
University poll confirms this 
reality, and sheds light on its 
implications.

C.S. 
Mott 
Children’s 
and 

Women’s 
Hospital’s 
National 

Poll on Children’s Health found 
that many parents of children 
ages five to 17 fail to notify doc-
tors when their children exhibit 
severe emotional behaviors.

Sixty percent of parents who 

were polled stated they would 
only speak to a doctor if their 
child was extremely sad for 
more than a month — which 

is an indicator of depression. 
However, only half said they 
would contact doctors if their 
child was showing excessive 
temper tantrums or was more 
worried or anxious than usual. 
Moreover, only 37 percent said 
they would tell their doctor if 
their child had trouble organiz-
ing homework.

Matthew 
Davis, 
profes-

sor of pediatrics and internal 
medicine, directed the poll and 
said parents sometimes don’t 
bring awareness to these issues 
because they think doctors can’t 
help. He said doctors are indeed 
able to help and that more par-
ents need to realize this.

“Although some parents may 

not see their child’s medical 
doctor as a source of advice or 
information about behavioral 
health, it turns out that many 
pediatricians and family physi-
cians are very ready and willing 
to help out,” he said.

Other common reasons par-

ents cited were that they did 
not believe these problems were 
“medical,” and they would rath-
er handle the issues themselves.

Sarah 
Clark, 
associate 

research scientist in the Depart-
ment of Pediatrics and an asso-
ciate director of the poll, said 
parents should learn from this 
poll.

“Parents need to think about 

two situations to explain to 
the doctor when we are talk-
ing about the behavioral and 
emotional health of their child: 
When something is out of the 
ordinary for the child him/her-
self, and when the child is out of 
step with his or her peers,” she 
said.

Clark said doctors should 

learn as well.

“Doctors need to create a 

space and cues that indicate to 
parents that these are issues 
that they can tell them about,” 
she said.

five years ago.
“When Enbridge’s Line B rup-

tured near Kalamazoo in 2010, 
residents there suffered from neu-
rological, respiratory and gastro-
intestinal problems, and a third of 
the families in that area had to be 
relocated,” Kaucheck said. “Let’s 
be real, Enbridge has a shaky track 
record, from 1996 to 2013, Enbridge 
has 1,244 reported spills, leaks or 
releases. Just last summer, they 
were found in violation of require-
ments for the very pipeline we’re 
here to discuss.”

Her statement elicited boos 

against Enbridge.

The last time an event of this size 

was held by the Oil and Water Don’t 
Mix Coalition regarding Pipeline 5 
was when hundreds of protesters 
met in St. Ignace in 2013.

The major organizers set up 

tents. Protesters encouraged pass-
ersby and event attendees to sign 
a petition to remove the pipe-
line, carried signs that said, “Shut 
Down Line 5 Pipeline,” umbrellas 
that read “Save My World, Save 
My Water,” and chanted along the 
roadside.

LSA junior Harry Freedman is 

interning with Clean Water Action 
over the summer and manned 
a tent at the protest. He said he 
was shocked when he learned the 
extremity of the issue.

“When I heard all of the details 

on it, I was astounded and disap-
pointed that it still exists and that 
we have legislation that allows 
businesses to use loopholes to their 
own advantage,” Freedman said. 
“It’s such a dangerous thing.”

Lee Sprag, a representative from 

the Ottawa Indians, led the pro-
testers in a traditional Ottawa wel-
come song with his drum. Several 
representatives from local tribes 
also spoke during the event.

During remarks at the protest, 

Nick Clark, organizer and mem-
ber of the Oil and Water Don’t Mix 
Coalition, said protesters were 
signing in, tweeting using the 
hashtag #shutdownline5 and send-
ing postcards to their represen-
tatives as well as demonstrating. 
Some Clean Water Action members 
such as LSA senior Molly Lefanow-
icz, who is a canvasser for the orga-
nization, said that after the protest 
they planned to inform commu-
nity members about the issue and 
encourage them to sign postcards 
that the organization will send to 
their representatives.

“We came up for the day to help 

out at this event and also we’re 
going to canvass in communities,” 
Lefanowicz said. “We’re going to 
knock on doors and let them know 
what’s going on and how they can 
get involved.”

Clark said he was interested in 

seeing the Pipeline 5 status report 
from Gov. Rick Snyder’s (R) Pipe-
line Task Force, which is sched-
uled to be released in the upcoming 
days. Clark also condemned state 
Rep. Ed McBroom (R–Vulcan) for 
signing House Bill 4540. The legis-
lation has been introduced into the 
House, and would amend the Free-
dom of Information Act to effec-
tively exempt Enbridge, if passed 
— thus rendering records regard-
ing the pipeline inaccessible to the 
public. 

However, Clark said he still has 

faith in the legislature, highlighting 
the four-bill package for pipeline

OPINION

M

y eight month campaign 
of the ’14-’15 school year is 
over. At times like these, I 

undoubtedly think 
back 
to 
winter 

workouts for my 
high school base-
ball team. Asking our coach why we 
were sweating so hard five months 
before the season began, he respond-
ed confidently: “If you ever want to be 
great, you have to work even harder in 
the off-season.”

I remember thinking that statement 

was so lame, so cliché. However, I’m not 
sure anything has contributed more to 
me trying to become a “person of let-
ters” — carrying a pencil around under 
the sun, reading and writing all day.

I figure you can make some excep-

tions though. I still need friends to 
work with, and we need a spot to 
work, quote unquote, the hangout 
spot. Through the first month of sum-
mer, the spot has been Bandemer Park 
on the river. Why? Because it’s gor-
geous. It’s everything you dreamed of 
throughout all 13 months of February.

Hear me out:
You can drive here, but we don’t. 

My friends pick me up on Division. 
My house is the last stop. They walk 
as a big group — 11 or 12 people — but 
not as a large cluster, more like three 
groups of three or four. I like to mean-
der from one to the other so I can hear 
everyone’s voice at least once. They all 

sound so young. Each group develops its 
own train of thought. One group will be 
amidst a heated debate over which res-
taurant has the best falafel pita: Jerusa-
lem Garden or Pita Kabob. I’m partial 
to the latter. Another might be taking 
collective shots at Teddy Cruz and the 
lunacy of his Tea Party constituents 
while the third might be having the 
more dire panel discussion over what 
the best Spike Jonze movie is. I try to 
drop a one-liner joke before departing 
every verbal hurrah for the next.

“Being John Malkovich? More like 

being Eli Sparkman, am I right or am 
I right?”

We cross the train tracks. I can do 

five steps in a row walking along a rail 
before losing my balance. We walk 
along the Argo trail on the west side of 
the river. It’s the nature zone. Friends 
who are Program in the Environment 
majors point at every tree and tell me 
its name in Latin. I smile and nod and 
confuse the names for one another. 
It’s perfect. I usually see a frog or two. 
There’s this light, muddy clay-colored 
one I see the most. I like to think it’s 
the same frog every time. I named him 
Roger because I’m a little more ironic 
than I should be.

Things are beginning to open up: 

a parking lot to the left, a bench and 
more trail to the center and the dock 
on the right. There are bikers in their 
undeniably lame looking spandex, 
bicycle gear. They sport helmets. They 

I 
 

grew up admiring super-
heroes. My first roller 
coaster was based on The 

Hulk. 
My 

first PG-13 
movie 
was 
Spi-

der-Man 
(played 
by 
Tobey 

Magu-
ire), 
and 

many of my 
mornings 
were spent 
watching 
Batman cartoons. Even today, 
most people who know me well 
know I’m a Batman fanatic. 
Throughout the years, though, 
I could never truly admire the 
female superheroes or villains 
presented to me.

Though there were times 

when I thought the female 
characters were more interest-
ing or more fun to watch, they 
were simply never as visible in 
the cartoons, and later in the 
movies. Every time a female 
character was presented to me, 
I wanted to love them, I really 
did, but I was always put off 
by their skin-tight costumes 
that I could never see myself 
wearing or their stories that 
always revolved around men. 
They always looked like cheap 
knock-offs of their male coun-
terparts. Superman was cooler 
than Wonder Woman. Batman 
was cooler than Catwoman, 
and the Joker was creepier 
than Harley Quinn.

In comics, I found the 

occasional 
female 
Muslim 

superhero, but they were also 
usually 
disappointments. 

Really, a burka-wearing super-

woman named Dust whose 
power is to turn herself into a 
cloud of sand? So in class last 
semester when I was told we 
were going to read Ms. Mar-
vel — a Marvel comic based on 
a Pakistani-American super-
hero — I was a bit skeptical. A 
Muslim girl in a mainstream 
comic book? Come on, what’s 
the catch?

To my surprise, this story 

was in no way a disappoint-
ment. While reading the comic, 
I sat next to my mother, and I 
pointed out to her all the simi-
larities: “Look, her parents are 
speaking in Urdu to her.” The 
comic book was well written, 
not just as a representation of 
a Pakistani-American Muslim, 
but also as a relatable superher-
oine. Kamala Khan, with her 
secret identity as a comic book 
fangirl, struggles with her real 
identity as a Muslim and a teen-
age girl. She 
is similar to 
the teenage 
superhero 
Spiderman, 
as she is a 
little geeky 
and doesn’t 
quite fit in 
with 
the 

popular 
crowd. 
As 

a female superhero, she makes 
the choice to wear a less reveal-
ing costume, as it fits with her 
personal identity better.

Though her character is a 

female and a minority whose 
story does not revolve around 
a man, it doesn’t put a dent in 
her popularity. In fact, it com-
pliments it. Ms. Marvel is one 
of Marvel’s best-selling comic 

books and is sitting well with 
fans as people relate to the 
familiarity of her struggles 
with her identity.

As Marvel and DC “experi-

ment” with diverse characters, 
one thing seems clear: charac-
ters from diverse backgrounds 
are as marketable as any other 
character when they’re well 
written. As readers and writers 
question whether diversifying 
characters will detract from 
their stories, the real question 
is why not have superheroes 
living with others in a world 
as diverse as the world around 
us? The rebooted Ms. Marvel 
as a woman of color attracts an 
audience without needing to 
be objectified in any way, and 
more power to her.

Despite the popularity of 

this version of Ms. Marvel, 
whether a character as “wildly” 
diverse as her would ever make 

it to the big 
screen 
is 

something 
I 
highly 

doubt will 
happen 
in 

the 
near 

future. 
When 
it 

comes 
to 

minority 
represen-

tation in movies, I’m usually 
disappointed. But maybe I’m 
just 
pessimistic. 
On-screen, 

the original secret identities, 
or personas, of the superhe-
roes are usually used, and most 
of the original or mainstream 
characters are white and male. 
Much of the problem is that 
instead of bringing characters 
that are already diverse to the 

An homage to the Huron

Their own heroes

forefront, or creating new superheroes, 
the characters in the comics are just 
temporarily rebooted.

Then, every time the movies are 

rebooted, these companies are faced 
with a choice between choosing 
between the character’s more main-
stream persona and the newer, diver-
sified persona, and they tend to stick 
with the original. Yet, if a comic book 
heroine that’s already diverse has 
become popular, why not make a movie 
about her? Why are these companies 
able to trust their readers with diver-
sity, but not their movie audience?

My hope is that these movies, as 

well every other superhero movie, 
has dynamic female characters so 
that young girls and boys can grow 
up without constantly finding weak 
female characters. No more Mary 
Jane, damsels in distress. No more 
finding Sue Storm naked in public 
two movies in a row. No more making 
superhero movies with hyper-sexual-
ized female characters meant only to 
appeal to men.

We know when you add a token 

female or a token minority into your 
story just to say you tried, but the 

truth is we also can see when you do 
not. That is why female superhero 
movies have flopped in the past. We 
want more real superheroes from 
diverse backgrounds, but that means 
putting real thought into their stories.

For anyone looking for strong 

female characters in superhero mov-
ies, we might be getting what we 
wanted. DC plans on releasing a 
Wonder Woman movie in 2017, and 
Marvel is planning on releasing a Cap-
tain Marvel movie in 2018. However, 
Kamala Khan will not be the persona 
because they are using the identity of 
Carol Danvers, who is white. This may 
be a logical choice considering that 
she’s an older and possibly more estab-
lished identity, but maybe if Kamala 
Khan was given a separate identity 
instead of living in the shadows of a 
past identity, she could one day make 
it to theaters or be featured in a 
 

television series.

Maybe one day, diverse heroes 

will be good enough to truly be their 
 

own heroes.

Tonya Allen, president and CEO 
of the Skillman Foundation, 
John Rakolta Jr., CEO of Wal-
bridge and Sandy Baruah, presi-
dent and CEO of the Detroit 
Regional Chamber composed 
the panel “The Choice is Ours: 
Road to Fixing Detroit’s Strug-
gling Schools Begins in Detroit.” 
This panel discussed poten-
tial solutions to educational 
challenges in Michigan. On 
Wednesday May 27, this discus-
sion kicked off the first full day 
of the Mackinac Policy Confer-
ence on Mackinac Island. The 
panelists spoke bluntly and pas-
sionately about the current state 
of Detroit schools and Michigan 
schools as they outlined the rec-
ommendations that their group, 
the Coalition for the Future of 
Detroit 
Schoolchildren, 
pro-

posed for remedying Detroit’s 
educational 
problems.

At 
times, 

panelist Rakol-
ta’s voice shook 
with 
anger 

as 
he 
spoke 

about the lack 
of educational 
attainment 
in 
Detroit, 

declaring 
the 

situation to be 
a crisis.

“How much more proof do we 

need that we are failing our chil-
dren?” asked Rakolta.

The frankness of the panel 

came as a surprise and chal-
lenged my preconceived notions 
of the conference. It’s hard, after 
all, to take a policy conference 
seriously as a legitimate source 
of discussion, debate and prog-
ress when it feels so much like 
an elitist schmoozefest. Times 
between events and meals seem 
to be reserved for making con-
nections with other successful, 
wealthy people who can afford 
to spend the week on Macki-

nac Island. The hefty price tag 
(onsite prices for registration 
at the conference are $2,150 for 
Chamber members and $2,925 
for future members), means that 
there’s undoubtedly a lack of 
socioeconomic diversity repre-
sented at the conference. A quick 
scan of the guest list shows an 
abundance of politicians, law-
yers, businessmen and journal-
ists — other fields are clearly 
underrepresented. Furthermore, 
a multitude of corporate spon-
sors and thus intertwined politi-
cal and corporate agendas, made 
me question how deep these 
discussions and speeches would 
be allowed to go. How effective 
can a policy conference be when 
it only has certain perspectives 
and is limited in depth?

Yet, at the panel on educa-

tional issues in Michigan and 

Detroit, the 
panelists 
spoke genu-
inely, if not 
paternal-
istically, 
for 
strug-

gling people 
in 
Detroit 

and 
across 

Michigan. 
Rakol-
ta 
spoke 

frankly about his anger at leg-
islators in Lansing for failing to 
fund education for our children 
properly and then failing to take 
responsibility. The moderator, 
Mary Kramer, even encouraged 
attendees to look for the legisla-
tors at the conference and talk to 
them about the issue.

This goes to show the power of 

the conference to enact change 
by informing and educating citi-
zens about important issues and 
putting them in an environment 
where they can easily access 
their legislators and voice their 
concerns. Despite the fact that 
the panel was led by CEOs, I 

found its members spoke about 
these issues after having spent 
ample time discussing them 
with people directly affected by 
them. Furthermore, they didn’t 
shy away from controversial dis-
cussions, and they encouraged 
action from their audience. If the 
rest of the conference continues 
in this direction, it can be a pow-
erful force for change.

However, 
the 
conference 

is still cost-inhibitive. It can 
encourage dialogue and civic 
action, but only amongst those 
who can afford to attend. It con-
nects citizens with legislators 
but only those privileged enough 
to be able to shell out over two 
grand to simply attend the con-
ference. It can talk seriously and 
genuinely about problems facing 
certain communities and groups 
but without really including 
their voices in the discussion.

When asked by the Daily 

how he thought the conference 
was going, Sen. Gary Peters 
(D–Mich.) 
said, 
“We 
come 

together, share ideas and it’s 
very productive.”

Which it is. The conference 

might be elitist, but it’s pro-
ductive. The event is going to 
tackle major issues in the next 
few days, such as diversity and 
equity. These are important 
topics to discuss and having 
these discussions can bring 
about real, positive change. If 
the panel on education set the 
tone for the rest of the confer-
ence, it will be an informational 
and powerful week of policy 
discussions. However, it would 
be an altogether more produc-
tive, democratic, informative 
and change-inducing confer-
ence if there were more people 
of different backgrounds com-
ing together and more ideas 
being shared.

aren’t too cool for helmets. I won-
der if they ever were.

About half of the time the dock 

is unusable because it’s already 
occupied by the rowing team. 
They are also adorned in less 
than — perhaps the word is com-
fortable — apparel. I roll the toes 
of my bare feet. We are trekking 
across the grass now to the wood-
en bench just behind the rower’s 
dock. I step on a rock, and the pain 
feels right.

Here, I have front row seats to 

the object of 
my desire: the 
Huron 
River. 

I 
feel 
every 

ripple pull at 
the strings of 
my heart. The 
light from the 
sun bounces off 
of its surface 
and spins into 
my eyes, like 
a ping-pong serve from your best 
friend. It would be offensive to 
wear sunglasses in front of a beam 
like this.

I pull out the notebook I bought 

from Walgreens for $1.50. I have 
a brief moment of contemplation 
over whether or not I should feel 
guilty for shopping there. I’m not 
sure what kind of behavior I’m 
above. I move on. The thought 
feels like a loose end.

I want to become a better writ-

er. I’m not really sure how one 
does so, but I assume that if I keep 
trying new exercises and tech-
niques then something will hap-
pen sooner or later.

Today I start a list. At the top I 

write, “100 ways to describe the 
Huron River.”

The first five are: 1) It’s like 

when you’re at the Big House, and 
they put a giant American flag over 
an entire section. Thousands of 
people push their hands and fin-

gers up against the bottom of it. 
These are those ripples. 2) It flows 
like the treadmill at your parent’s 
house that your dad’s trying to get 
in shape on. 3) It — like anyone else 
— has obstacles: rocks, branches 
and rapids. 4) In the beginning God 
made the Huron, and it was good. 
5) At the bottom of the Huron is 
the Devil’s treasure. Let’s stay here 
and float — me and you.

It can be discouraging when 

your descriptions always turn into 
bad, semi-romantic song lyrics. I 

figure I’ve got 
to write it out 
of me: let it 
flow like the 
Huron.

We 
do 

timed 
free 

writes. 
That 

is, 
ask 
a 

stranger for a 
random word, 
throw 
the 

timer on somebody’s iPhone for 
however many minutes you want 
to go — be it five, seven or 10 min-
utes — and then write continu-
ously for the duration. It makes 
you write. So often it’s easy to 
pretend you’re working on a col-
umn in your head. Put it down 
on paper. Read it out loud to your 
friends. Know yourself.

The most recent free write 

we did was based on the word 
“grumpy.” A very close friend of 
mine wrote how she was lying in 
bed this morning feeling irritable, 
feeling grumpy. That is, until she 
received a text from us asking 
if she felt like hanging out at the 
Huron. Five hours later it was 
another perfect Ann Arbor day.

It’s summertime in A2. Where’s 

your hangout spot? What are you 
up to?

ALBUM REVIEW

‘Between’ fails 
with lacking plot

TV REVIEW

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

“Between,” a new Canadian series 

on City and Netflix, belongs to the 
genre that channels like the CW and 
MTV have been 
milking 
enter-

taining 
shows 

out of for years: 
YA science fic-
tion combining 
supernatural 
and 
dystopian 

elements 
with 

teen drama. Shows like “The Vam-
pire Diaries,” “Teen Wolf” and 
“iZombie” have been doing this with 
lots of success because, for all the 
stigma attached to the “paranor-
mal romance” and “dystopian YA” 
genres, they’re enormously enter-
taining.

“Between” follows an ensemble 

cast of characters living in the small 
town of Pretty Lake, where a strange 
disease suddenly strikes and kills 
everyone over 22 years old. As the 
pilot episode progresses and adults 
quickly die off, the military raises 
a fence around the city, effectively 
quarantining everyone inside.

In the hands of creator Michael 

McGowan (the critically acclaimed 
“Still Mine”), who wrote the pre-
miere, the show doesn’t deliver the 
thrills its genre often suggests. One 
of the problems is that while shows 
like “Teen Wolf” both commit to 
their goofy premises and don’t take 
themselves too seriously, “Between” 
doesn’t show a lot of self-awareness. 
There’s almost no real fun to be 
had here; subplots basically revolve 
around the teen characters’ parents 
dying and there isn’t much variety.

“Between” could be entertain-

ing if the actors hinted at a sense of 
humor that the script itself doesn’t 
suggest, but the cast is almost uni-
formly bland. Jennette McCurdy, 
who showed some sense of comic 
timing in “iCarly,” gives the vibe of 
a poor man’s Juno in her first scene 
as Wiley, walking down the hallway 
at school with her best friend Adam 
(Jesse Carere, “Finding Carter”), but 
the sarcastic charm of Sam Puck-
ett is toned down here in favor of 
Wiley’s uninteresting teen pregnan-
cy subplot. Besides, any chemistry 
Wiley might have with Adam grinds 
to halt whenever Jesse Carere opens 

his mouth. Carere’s acting is surpris-
ingly bad, his line deliveries all read 
in the same emotionless voice and 
his unblinking eyes always staring 
blankly at whatever poor actor he’s 
sharing the screen with.

Those are only two of the char-

acters who round out the ensemble 
cast. There’s also Wiley’s religious 
sister Melissa Day (Brooke Palsson, 
“Less than Kind”), jail inmate Mark 
(Jack Murray, “The Prize Winner of 
Defiance, Ohio”), rich kid Chuck Lott 
(Justin Kelly, “Degrassi”), farmer 
Gord (Ryan Allen, “Get Rich or Die 
Tryin’”), drug dealer Ronnie (Kyle 
Mac, “Carrie”) and Pat (Jim Watson, 
“The Strain”). Notice how I couldn’t 
even pair Pat with an interesting 
character epithet? That shows how 
hard it is to find anything intriguing 
about these characters.

It’s difficult to get remotely 

invested in any of these characters 
because the pilot episode spends 
so little time with only of them, 
sketching them out with extremely 
expository dialogue in brief interac-
tions before moving on to the next 
character. The episode becomes 
marginally more entertaining when 
the unrelated plot lines begin to 
intertwine, just because the episode 
can be more efficient with its time. 
Gord interrupts a conflict between 
Chuck’s cartoonish, rich father and 
Pat and Ronnie, then rushes over to 
help deliver Wiley’s baby. Still, the 
intersection of conflicts is kept to 
a minimum, leaving the audience 
with a number of disparate subplots 
that don’t demand next Thursday’s 
follow-up.

It’s hard to see what future epi-

sodes of “Between” could look like, 
both content-wise and quality-wise. 
With the right cast and crew, later 
episodes could prove more inter-
esting, since there’s potential for 
the idea of an isolated “Lord of the 
Flies”-esque society without adults. 
Perhaps putting Wiley, Ronnie 
and Chuck in a situation in which 
they’re forced into becoming the 
leaders of a new society will bring 
out something new and fascinat-
ing in the conflicts. Still, based on 
the performances and writing of 
the lackluster pilot episode alone, 
“Between” might not be capable of 
something like that. Besides, most 
viewers might not have the patience 
to wait that long.

Rocky LP revives Yams

Following ‘To Pimp 
a Butterfly,’ ‘A.L.L.A’ 
gives voice to the dead

By ADAM DEPOLLO

Managing Arts Editor

“We catchin’ spirits. We ain’t 

even really rappin’, we just lettin’ 
our dead homies tell stories for us.”

Those words 

are 
the 
last 

spoken by the 
ghost of Tupac 
Shakur 
on 

“Mortal Man” 
— the closing 
track on Ken-
drick Lamar’s 
To Pimp a But-
terfly— 
and 

they offer what is perhaps the best 
characterization thus far of the 
otherworldly 
aura 
surrounding 

2015’s most ambitious projects in 
hip hop and R&B. Starting with 
Flying Lotus’s October release 
You’re Dead!, continuing through 
D’Angelo’s 
Black 
Messiah 
and 

finally to Kendrick’s masterpiece, 
a new canon of technically and 
lyrically stunning work is rapidly 
being assembled as America’s most 
critically acclaimed Black artists 
open themselves up to conversa-
tions with an ever-expanding host 
of spirits.

I bring up the race of these musi-

cians in part because their music 
expresses a hyper-awareness of 
their own identity as Black men, 
but mostly because the spirit realm 
their songs belong to hangs over a 
physical world increasingly cov-
ered with Black bodies. The shoot-
ing and death of unarmed teenager 
Trayvon Martin in 2012 served as 
an introduction to what now seems 
like an unending litany of Black 
victims gunned down by white 
authority figures. The sheer weight 
of this reality should be inescapable 
for any American, but it is particu-
larly so for African-Americans, who 
make up a disproportionate per-
centage of the casualties of police 
violence in this country. “Trayvon 
Martin could have been me,” Presi-
dent Obama famously said. 

These artists find themselves in a 

landscape covered in bodies, but it’s 
unclear whether they’re standing 
in a cemetery or in front of a mass 
grave. The difference between the 
two scenes hinges largely on the 

cyclical debate over whether people 
like Mike Brown, for example, were 
criminals who received their just 
desserts or innocent victims of a 
society that unjustly singles them 
out for destruction. While the offi-
cial report invariably describes 
the former scenario, often the only 
witness who might contradict the 
powers that be is the dead man with 
a policeman’s bullet in his chest 
— and, as the old adage goes, dead 
men tell no tales. 

But it would seem that dead men 

can in fact rap, and nowhere is that 
fact more apparent than on the lat-
est release from Harlem-bred MC 
A$AP Rocky, At.Long.Last.A$AP, 
which features posthumous vocals 
from Texas rapper Pimp C and 
A$AP Mob founder A$AP Yams, 
both of whom died young of a pro-
methazine overdose complicated by 
sleep apnea. While Tupac’s benevo-
lent ghost offers guidance to a 
troubled young rapper on To Pimp a 
Butterfly, A.L.L.A.’s cover artwork, 
which features the upper half of 
Yams’s face eerily superimposed 
onto Rocky’s forehead, suggests a 
much more ambiguous relationship 
between the artist and the ghosts 
trying to speak through him. 

The source of that ambiguity is 

left somewhat unclear by the end 
of the album, but the emotional and 
philosophical fluctuation between 
A.L.L.A.’s first nine pot- and LSD-
laden tracks, to the homage-heavy 
quartet running from “Jukebox 
Joints” to “Wavybone” and finally 
to the frenetic rumination on the 
overlaps between love, drugs and 
money on the LP’s final six tracks 
makes it clear that this album is 
something of a musical disembow-
elment for A$AP Rocky. He’s put-
ting himself out there with a type of 
frankness and self-confidence that 
simply wasn’t present in his metic-
ulously crafted Long.Live.A$AP 
and Live.Love.A$AP personae, and 
this frankness occasionally leads 
him to blurt out things that really 
should have stayed inside his head, 
like the “Type of hate that make 
you feel worse than a rape victim” 
line off of “Back Home.” Yet other 
quotable lines — like “Left ‘em Har-
lem shaking on the pavement” from 
“Pharsyde” or “This year I turned 
racist, all I wanna see is green 
faces” from “Electric Body” — 
reveal a beautifully macabre sense 
of humor that lends Rocky’s crudity 
and goofiness a significant political 
and philosophical weight. The guts 

he leaves on the table are perhaps 
hard to look at, but they’re there in 
all their gory detail. While mean-
ing is there to be found, grabbing 
onto it means getting your hands 
dirty.

And I think the best way to think 

of A.L.L.A. is as A$AP Rocky run-
ning his hands through his own 
entrails, painfully searching for a 
way to define himself among that 
pile of skin, blood and intestines. 
Part of that process involves exor-
cising the ghosts he finds inside 
himself, which leads, of course, 
to the voice of A$AP Yams filling 
the same role on “Back Home” 
that Tupac played for Kendrick on 
“Mortal Man.” He closes out the 
album with a Dame Dash-esque 
invocation accompanied by haunt-
ing, reverb-heavy piano melodies, 
concluding Rocky’s self-vivisec-
tion on a definitely unsettling 
note. His speech evokes Harlem, 
fashion, cultural influence and the 
A$AP Mob, and it might have been 
a spot-on description of Rocky’s 
pre-A.L.L.A. ethos. But Yams is 
dead, and while talking to his ghost 
might explain everything leading 
up to his death, it doesn’t explain 
what comes after.

And what does come after? For 

now, Rocky’s answer is an image 
he provides at the end of “Dreams”: 
“Police brutality was on my TV 
screen / Harmony, love, drugs and 
peace is all we need.” But some-
how that doesn’t satisfy either, in 
part because it doesn’t do enough 
to bridge the gap between the two 
lines. What it has done, however, is 
demonstrate that Rocky is tapping 
into the same issues facing the best 
artists in hip hop right now, issues 
that have already produced some of 
the best and most socially engaged 
albums of the last 20 years. This 
album is not one of those mas-
terpieces — though if it came out 
in any year other than 2015, I 
would be writing a much differ-
ent conclusion to this piece — but 
it suggests to me that we’re look-
ing at the prelude to an explosion 
of depth and maturity in Rocky’s 
sound, and I wouldn’t be surprised 
if we’ll be looking at A.L.L.A. in the 
afterglow of Rocky’s next album 
in much the same way that we’re 
looking at good kid, m.A.A.d. city 
now. 

In the meantime, the dead don’t 

rest easy — but they just found 
another rapper who can make 
them speak.

‘Tomorrowland’ 
builds to failure

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

I can say this for “Tomorrow-

land”: it gets an A for effort.

When a film like this falls short 

of both audience 
expectations and 
its 
own 
goals, 

it’s a small mis-
fortune. 
There 

are so few films 
today, 
family-

friendly or oth-
erwise, that are 
wholly 
original 

and creative and 
carry 
messages 

both inspiring and meaningful. 
“Tomorrowland” wants to be one 
of those films, and for roughly 
two-thirds of its runtime, it very 
nearly gets there. But, plagued by 
a poorly conceived and even more 
poorly executed third act and 30 
minutes of unnecessary runtime, 
what begins as an homage to won-
der and innovation devolves into a 
cross between “An Inconvenient 
Truth” and the worst James Bond 
movie imaginable. 

Our story follows high school 

student Casey Newton (Britt Rob-
ertson, “The Longest Ride”), the 
daughter of a NASA engineer and 
a genius in her own right. Sci-
ence and ingenuity run in Casey’s 
blood; ever the optimist, she 
believes innovation can fix a world 
beset by global warming, the 
threat of nuclear extermination 
and various other dour subjects 
she learns about in school. Chosen 
to join the ranks of Tomorrow-
land, Casey sets off on a journey 
to get there, along the way meet-
ing Frank (George Clooney, “The 
Monuments Men”), a former resi-
dent of Tomorrowland and the 
pessimist to Casey’s optimist.

The bulk of the film consists 

of backstory and the journey to 
Tomorrowland, 
which 
actually 

proves rather entertaining, almost 
like a more kid-friendly (but no less 
dangerous) and futuristic version 
of “Indiana Jones.” Director Brad 
Bird (“Mission Impossible: Ghost 
Protocol”) creates tense action 
without sacrificing clarity, and the 
camera moves freely throughout 
the sets, creating a great sense of 
space and openness. Of particu-

lar note is one breathtaking, long 
tracking shot that follows Casey 
through Tomorrowland. 

But the film breaks the ever-

important “show, don’t tell” rule 
and suffers as a result. “Tomor-
rowland” is hounded by lengthy 
exposition that eventually resorts 
to preachy diatribes about hope 
and belief in a world on the verge of 
darkness. Of course, a monologue 
here or there does no damage, but 
“Tomorrowland” shoots for pro-
found and ends, unfortunately, in 
slog several times over. 

Blame rests in the screenplay — 

co-writers Bird and Damon Lin-
delof (TV’s “Lost”) invest so much 
time in crafting an engaging and 
exciting setup that they end up 
with a half-assed, very forced third 
act and expect us to settle for it. 
Further, something gets lost in the 
fact that the true villain turns out 
to be humanity’s own folly, igno-
rance and pessimism, rather than 
someone or something tangible.

Thus the tragedy of the film: 

Everything so very nearly works. 
Clooney and Robertson have great 
chemistry and play off each other 
nicely. The camerawork is top 
notch, the special effects equally 
so. Everything works except this 
one, very big, very important third 
act.

And “Tomorrowland” ‘s inten-

tions are so admirable; it’s that 
much harder to accept its failure. 
As far as blockbusters go, we live 
in a world of sequels, in which cit-
ies are destroyed, and superhero 
flicks, in which cities are destroyed. 
“Tomorrowland” is the first film 
I’ve seen in a long time about build-
ing rather than breaking. It’s the 
kind of movie Spielberg might’ve 
directed 30 years ago, a film some-
where between “E.T.” and “AI.” It’s 
hard to be mad at that.

But good intentions don’t make 

good endings (or movies in gen-
eral). Maybe that’s to be expected 
from the guy who created “Lost.”

MOVIE REVIEW

More than just a journal

On the necessity of 
written, narcissistic 

notebooks

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editor

Notebooks are rarely treated well 

in my care — hoarded away until I 
record a few clusters of airy, beau-
tiful words, then unceremoniously 
discarded far before my scrawl 
reaches their last leaves. Mostly, 
this is because my writing oscillates 
between loose and undisciplined 
workmanship (and penmanship) 
and clenched knots of taut words. 
This rhythm cannot sustain, so I 
abandon the project.

Occasionally I’ll flip through 

an old notebook. But in the day of 
screens, of articles, of epistolary 
communication, of writing (we can 
write an essay, submit it and have it 
returned spider-webbed with edits 
without ever pressing that increas-
ingly un-pressed “print” icon), it’s 
harder to extrapolate what I meant 
from that foreign hand — at least 
compared to the uniform type of 
Cambria, font 12.

An inherited perfectionism grav-

itates to the Word document, which 
contains the pen’s boldness and 
the pencil’s irresolution. The Word 
document’s most attractive feature: 
on a blankly expectant page, that 
blinking cursor that promises to 
efface all trace of uncertainty, all 
mistake. By surgical precision of 
that wand, the polished sentence is 
turned out by the Word machine. 
You see no proof of the 50 back-
spaces per line, the itinerary of side 
trips to the thesaurus, the smudged 
corners of a read, re-read and read 
again paper.

By the same turn, though, this 

pangs as a loss, probably because we 
have loaded in us a desperate and 
corrective urge to preserve what we 
can in the age of crystalline screens. 
In paperless culture, we ache for the 
mess of paper to remind us, if not of 
something as grand as our human-
ity, at least our rough margins.

If writing on Word represents 

the Hegelian arc of progress, with 
each antithetical deletion molding 
its rhetorical bearings into the qua 
sentence, this means foundational 
changes are harder to muster. With-
out record, each blow to the struc-
ture may prove that the center will 
not hold — and the rubble is irrecov-

erable (hence my neurotic impulse 
to copy and paste sections onto sep-
arate documents until it is scattered 
piecemeal through my computer).

But writing in a notebook is for 

anchoring those flits of brilliance 
firmly onto a page, without care 
of organization. We jot, scribble, 
very rarely compose. To write in 
a notebook is to force yourself to 
abandon the project of Writing with 
a capital W and instead become a 
scribe to your mind, to take down 
all its tyrannical interruptions and 
detours. Where a typed document 
circumscribes the id’s creative 
fancy within a careful line of attack, 
the notebook lets it lope across the 
college-ruled lines. The Word docu-
ment is just that — a document — a 
feat of logical determination that 
demands to be read.

The 
unreadability 
of 
other 

people’s musings — their chicken 
scratch, their questionable syn-
tax, their strange fixations — is the 
notebook’s ultimate defense against 
literary legacy. And concomitant 
with puzzles of the psyche is the 
notebook’s fixation on mundane, 
of which the sentimental value 
belongs only to the writer. We imag-
ine the lurid confessions other peo-
ple’s journals must contain, while 
ours also simply logs, as mine does, 
that last 30th of May I was “sitting 
outside Babo, after I flirted again 
with that cute coffee guy.”

Or the trajectory of prior rela-

tionships, which my journal fol-
lows via a predictable through line 
of preliminary excitement, then 
intimacy-cum-complacency, before 
inevitable spates of verbal violence 
broken up by boredom. Reading 
accounts of my relationships does 
little to rekindle old desire. Rather, 
it is with a detached and anthropo-
logical curiosity that I fall into the 
pages. All that passion feels sterile 
now, like a preserved part of me 
before it was inoculated by time and 
further experience.

But it does remind me that the 

twinges of immediacy aren’t des-
tined to reverberate endlessly into 
the future, or even be folded neatly 
into an essay, but perhaps just be 
filed away in the cluttered archives 
of an old journal. Stresses like an 
unfound internship, triumphs like 
a terrific Bloody Mary finally found 
lose their gleam under an inch of 
dust. If there is a retrospective pay-
off to the journal, it is to show that 
this — yes, that — shall pass.

Mostly, though, the journal’s 

worth is found in its current under-
taking. In a health-centric culture 
where recreation doubles as self-
improvement, journaling is often 
labeled as therapeutic. Yet this 
imposes a wholesome utilitarianism 
onto an act whose definitive trait is 
unapologetic self-indulgence, even 
narcissism. Take lists, which are a 
reccurring feature in my journals. 
What I ate last night: gluten-free 
pizza (heirloom tomatoes, mozza-
rella, basil from our garden), salad 
(shaved zucchini, lemon and olive 
oil, basil, pine nuts), beer (Magic 
Hat). What I wore to the airport: 
leotard (black), white eyelet shirt, 
shorts (vintage, Levis), tan sandals 
(to show off my new pedicure).

All together, these notebook 

lists comport the girl I like to think 
I am. After all, it’s a flattering 
gaze, visualizing ourselves by dis-
crete attributes, which both reveal 
everything and abstract us into 
conglomerates of products. I am 
the type of person who wears pastel 
ballet flats with an oxford cloth but-
ton down and drinks a small black 
coffee. The truth lies somewhere in 
the middle; we are neither a com-
pendium of attributes nor describ-
able by one fluid stroke.

But the notebook invites us to 

imagine our lives are worthy of 
analysis, allows us to transform 
our daily routine into pattern — of 
which presumably some grand and 
imaginary statistician will pore 
over. Taking down the details of my 
day is playing director for my own 
movie: fishhooks of wisdom that 
have latched onto my skin, lines 
of poetry, warm recounts of sunny 
days. I don’t write on the ugly days, 
and if I do it tends to be short and 
ominous (“so-and-so didn’t text 
and I feel February looming”).

What I think is that we jour-

nal in case there is no God’s-eye 
surveillance, in case our closests 
aren’t turning their careful scru-
tiny to us (they aren’t), and so 
that the fascinating trivia of our 
life doesn’t languish unacknowl-
edged. By putting pen to paper, 
we draw ourselves from the slip-
stream of day-to-day life, which 
can churn days into weeks and 
weeks into months of rote rou-
tine. Writing quells those lapses 
in meta-awareness. Like a mirror 
facing a mirror, the mind’s con-
siderations on itself can echo into 
infinity. Eventually, though, your 
hand starts to cramp.

Specifically, Clark said pro-

viding checklists for parents to 
fill out and putting up posters 
identifying behavioral and emo-
tional issues in the exam rooms 
can help alert parents to remem-
ber to discuss these issues with 
doctors.

Davis said future research 

regarding what messages and 
cues are the most effective in 
eliciting 
these 
conversations 

between parents and doctor is 
pending.

One specific approach Clark 

mentioned is integrated behavioral 
health, in which doctors consult 
with patients and parents in the 
presence of trained behavioral 
therapists or counselors.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com SPORTS

wrote their own page when no 

one expected them to, and that’s 
awesome.”

Before 
the 
celebration, 
it 

was about doing enough to win. 
Although he didn’t look like his 
usual overpowering self, Adcock 
(10-4) earned his third win in eight 
days, pitching 5.2 innings and 
allowing just two hits.

At the plate, Michigan — enter-

ing the game as the conference’s top 
offense — struggled to get things 
going, only accumulating six hits in 
the game. After falling behind, 1-0, 
in the third inning, however, the 
bats seized every 
opportunity from 
a Terrapin error 
to 
extend 
the 

inning.

Seeing-eye 

RBI singles by 
junior 
designat-

ed hitter Cody 
Bruder and senior outfielder Kevin 
White opened the scoring, and from 
there the Wolverines rolled, batting 
around in the inning and providing 
enough offense to win.

“We always go out there and try 

to make the pitcher throw as many 
pitches as we can and see a lot of 
pitches, and when he makes a mis-
take, that’s when we strike,” said 
senior outfielder Jackson Glines, 
who led the Tournament with 
nine hits. “We’re an opportunistic 
offense, (Bakich) doesn’t always 
like that, but we try to take what we 
can when we can.”

With the eight teams combining 

for a .238 batting average through-
out the tournament, hits were at a 
premium on both sides. In addition 
to Adcock, the Wolverines’ defense 
ensured that the four-run fourth 

inning was more than enough, rob-
bing base hits and killing rallies.

Sophomore first baseman Carmen 

Benedetti made the most notable of 
the plays, leaving his feet to snag a 
foul ball that had drifted into the sec-
ond row of the stands. With plenty of 
errors from high-seeded teams, the 
Wolverines’ ability to stay composed 
and avoid mistakes stood out.

“We didn’t necessarily avoid 

those mistakes in the season,” 
Bakich said. “We dug ourselves a 
hole, and we had moments early in 
the year — starting 2-5 or 0-3 in the 
Big Ten — where those were learn-
ing moments for us.”

“We’ve had our struggles, and 

those struggles have made us stron-
ger. That’s what you saw this week-

end.”

Tensions 

mounted 
in 

the top of the 
seventh, 
when 

Maryland grew 
upset with home 
plate 
umpire 

Jim 
Schaly’s 

strike zone. After multiple delays, 
Maryland coach John Szefc was 
ejected from the game.

The Terrapins responded by tal-

lying a second run in the eighth 
inning, but third baseman Jose 
Cuas was thrown out stretching a 
double into a triple, ending the rally 
with just one run. But Maryland 
wasn’t done yet.

***
Brandon Lowe lived for moments 

like this.

Maryland’s second baseman — 

seen as one of the best players in the 
conference — strolled to the plate 
with the bases loaded and two outs 
in the ninth inning. The Terrapins 
already scored one run to make it 
4-3 in the ninth inning, and were 
one swing of the bat away from a 
lead. They were a swing away from 

erasing the four-run Michigan 
fourth inning made possible by an 
error, a swing away from complet-
ing a three-run comeback effort and 
a swing away from punching their 
own NCAA Tournament ticket.

Lowe had gone 0-for-3 in the 

game, but his team-leading .342 bat-
ting average suggested he wouldn’t 
be hitless for long.

In the other dugout, Bakich took 

a walk.

Usually perched on the top step, 

the coach felt compelled to calm his 
team down. As he told everyone they 
were fine, then turned to give his 
fielders adjustments without blink-
ing, it became clear that the same 
coach who mentioned ‘Champion-
ship’ 19 times in his opening press 
conference three years ago wasn’t 
going to miss his first chance at one 
— not if he could help it.

Cronenworth, who would later 

be named the tournament’s Most 
Outstanding Player, tried every-
thing to stay loose. He clicked his 
heels to get the mud off, did a couple 
arm circles and took a deep breath. 
Turning himself into a high-profile 
prospect in his time in Ann Arbor, 
Cronenworth was one Lowe swing 
away from ending his career at 
Michigan.

But he wasn’t ready for that, not 

yet. Strike one.

The next pitch was even better 

than a strike. Lowe popped up, the 
dugout exploded, but restrained 
itself because in a rain-soaked game 
and a tournament that had seen even 
the nation’s best teams self destruct 
from errors, you just don’t know.

It was a high floater to left and 

senior outfielder Kevin White, who 
drove in the winning run with a 
seeing-eye single to left in the fourth 
inning, camped out under it. White 
captured the ball, and Michigan 
captured its 36th Big Ten Champi-
onship.

For the 22nd time, but just 

the first since 2008, the Michi-
gan baseball team is postseason-
bound.

In Monday’s NCAA Tournament 

selection show, it was announced 
that the Wolver-
ines (14-10 Big 
Ten, 37-23 over-
all) 
will 
travel 

to Louisville to 
play in a regional 
hosted by No. 3 
Louisville.

Michigan will 

be the third seed 
in 
the 
tourna-

ment. In addition 
to the Cardinals, 
No. 19 Bradley 
and 
Morehead 

State will partici-
pate as the second 
and fourth seeds, 
respectively.

The Wolverines will play Bradley 

on Friday at 2 p.m. at Jim Patter-
son Stadium. The Braves (9-11 Mis-
souri Valley, 35-19) hold a 3-6 record 
against ranked teams and beat their 
one Big Ten opponent, Iowa, 5-4 on 
April 14.

The tournament is double-elim-

ination format, so Michigan will 
need to win at least three games to 

advance to a Super Regional. It last 
did so in 2007, when it upset No. 1 
Vanderbilt in Nashville. Likely its 
largest obstacle will be the Car-
dinals (25-5 Atlantic Coast, 45-18 
overall).

Louisville is 10-5 against ranked 

teams, and went 1-2 in three 
games against Big Ten teams, 
beating Purdue but falling to Indi-
ana and Ohio State. The Cardinals 
are no stranger to regional action, 
hosting a regional for the third-
straight year and having made the 
College World Series each of the 
last two seasons.

To make it into the Tourna-

ment, Michigan got hot at the 
right time, winning the Big Ten 
Tournament to secure an auto-
matic bid. All five of its victories 
in the past week were over teams 
that made the Tournament — No. 
14 Oklahoma State, Indiana, No. 
19 Iowa, No. 4 Illinois and Mary-
land.

“It’s still settling in for some of 

the guys,” said junior right-hand-
er Jacob Cronenworth after the 
announcement. “It’s a whirlwind of 
emotions these past 24 hours. It’s 
been awesome. I don’t think a lot 
of people expected us to win it, and 
when we got that final out, it was 
awesome.”

Senior outfielder Kevin White looks to help carry Michigan’s success to Louisville.

“We’ve had our 

struggles.”


By BEN FIDELMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

MINNEAPOLIS — Like a tree’s 

rings signaling age, outfield walls 
at college baseball stadiums show 
how a program has grown through 
the years. Michigan added to that 
legacy in a big way on Sunday by 
winning the Big Ten Tournament 
and clinching the team’s first bid 
to the NCAA Tournament since 
2008.

“We talked the other day about 

changing the 35 to 36 on the wall 
(at Ray Fisher Stadium),” said 
Michigan closer Jacob Cronen-
worth. “We all had a common goal, 
and that’s what 
helped us with 
our 
confidence 

in today’s game.”

With 
the 

bases 
loaded 

and 
two 
outs 

with Maryland 
fighting in what 
could be its last 
at-bat, 
Bakich 

descended down from his usual 
perch on the top rung of the dug-
out stairs. He stood at the side of 
the bench, with his hands on his 
hips and bright-maize jacket glow-
ing with pride. “Now this is base-
ball,” he said, gazing out over the 
field.

Assistant coach Nick Schnabel, 

who’s been alongside Bakich since 
their playing days at East Carolina, 
could sense the end was near even 
though the Terrapins were threat-
ening. “I can smell it,” he exhaled 
to nobody in particular.

Maryland’s Brandon Lowe, the 

team’s leading hitter, popped a ball 
to left fielder Kevin White, and 
the celebration began.

Players were already halfway 

from the dugout to the mound 
when the ball touched down 
in White’s glove, engulfing the 
already-embracing 
Wolverine 

battery of Cronenworth and Ken-
dall Patrick. The cluster of players 
jumped around the infield before 
toppling to the ground from the 
weight of the bullpen that had 
suddenly arrived and dragged 
everyone down to a dog-pile.

Hats and shirts with “B1G 

Tournament Champions” were 
quickly distributed, and play-

ers took turns 
taking pictures 
with the slick 
trophy.

But 
Bakich 

wasn’t in the 
celebration with 
the other coach-
es and players. 
He was leaning 
against the dug-

out rail, arms crossed in front of 
him and a smile in his eyes, just 
soaking it all in.

“This is what it’s all about. It’s 

unbelievable.”

The third-year coach of the 

Wolverines (37-23) had taken the 
team back to college baseball’s 
promise land: the NCAA Tourna-
ment.

***
After Michigan home games, 

the coaching staff’s children own 
the turf at Ray Fisher Stadium. 
Whether it’s running the bases 
or taking batting practice in the 

cages, people with the last name 
Bakich and Schnabel often out-
number everyone else on the field.

It gives a family feel to Michi-

gan baseball. Players will be 
doing interviews for TV or print 
media and little Colt Bakich sud-
denly sprints through his legs, 
prompting a surprised smile from 
the sometimes grumpy athletes.

Though 
using 
youngsters 

to help facilitate the feeling is 
unconventional, the family feel-
ing is nothing exclusive to Team 
149.

Stretching back to Michigan 

baseball’s “decade of dominance” 
in the 1980s, many program 
alumni from that period say that 
their resume of 10 Big Ten regular 
season titles, nine NCAA regional 
appearances and four trips to the 
College 
World 

Series probably 
wouldn’t 
have 

happened if not 
for the Michi-
gan 
baseball 

bond.

“When 
you 

sign on to come 
to 
Michigan, 

part 
of 
it 
is 

because of the 
Michigan base-
ball family,” said Jeff Jacobson, 
who played for the Wolverines 
from 1980-83. His son, Eric, is 
currently a senior second base-
man for the team. “It’s a very 
strong group, and there has been 
a lot of success in the program. 
There’s a bond that develops 
through hard work and success.

“Being with each other through 

at your worst moments when 
you’re exposed to thousands of 
people, all the errors or walk-off 
home runs that you give up. There 
are the highest moments as well. 
Everyone shares that bond.”

The evidence from this season 

— the last week in particular — has 
been clear to agree with the idea 
that winning catalyzes the Michi-
gan bond. Throughout the tourna-
ment, Michigan became known 
as the most confident bunch, even 
though they were ranked lowest of 
the eight teams in Rating Percent-
age Index.

Playing with 

a swagger, the 
team looks and 
feels 
like 
it’s 

growing 
clos-

er with every 
game.

“I’m 
so 

happy for the 
guys,” 
said 

former Michi-
gan and major 
league pitcher Jim Abbott, who 
won two Big Ten Tournaments in 
his college career. “There’s tre-
mendous pride when you get to 
do something impactful for the 
program, like winning a cham-
pionship, there’s nothing better 
than that.”

And the Wolverines will have 

a shot next weekend at adding 
another number to the outfield 
wall, another ring to the tree of 
Michigan’s oldest varsity sport 
having become the eighth squad 
from Ann Arbor to reach the Col-
lege World Series in Omaha.

“We’re standing on the shoul-

ders of 148 years of proud Michi-
gan baseball tradition and being 
lifted up by many great teams 
and great men that came before 

us,” said Michi-
gan coach Erik 
Bakich after it 
was announced 
that the team 
would advance 
to Regional play 
to take on No. 19 
Bradley in Lou-
isville.

“We’re 
just 

trying to write 
our chapter on 

page 149 and just trying to con-
tribute and do our piece.”

***
In early February, Bakich gath-

ered Michigan baseball players, 
their families, program alumni 
and community members for a 
pre-season banquet to kick off the 
spring practices schedule. Called 
the leadoff banquet, the evening 

started off with a catered meal, 
before Bakich settled the room 
down and addressed the few hun-
dred people that comprised the 
crowd.

From the first words he said, it 

was clear that his words would set 
a tone for the rest of the season.

About five minutes into the 

speech, he said that this would be 
the “interactive” portion of the eve-
ning. Bakich asked that all Michi-
gan baseball alumni in the room 
stand, yielding about 30 adults. 
Next, he asked for those who were 

Big Ten Champi-
ons for the pro-
gram to stand, 
and about three-
quarters of the 
original 
group 

remained stand-
ing. Finally, he 
asked those who 
had won the Col-
lege World Series 
to stand — and 
three 
elderly 

gentlemen responded.

Hailing from the 1962 Wol-

verine squad that took home the 
program’s lone national cham-
pionship, the elder men drew a 
standing ovation from the crowd. 
Current players could be seen 
straining on their tiptoes to get a 
look at the heroes — the men who 
epitomize what it is that they all 
work so hard for.

More recently, other program 

alumni have reached out to give 
their support to the team as it 
heads into NCAA play this week-
end at Louisville.

“We’re standing on the shoul-

ders of 148 years of great Michi-
gan teams and all the support 
we’ve received from guys on the 
1953

sent a message, he was the cap-
tain of that team. Ed Hood, Dick 
Hoenig from the 1962 team sent a

“It’s awesome, you see all these

a lot of positive energy being

The players can feel the back-

ing of Michigan’s oldest varsity

something happen with it.

When they return to the lead-

Baseball all in the family

The Michigan baseball team thrives on the support of past times, which have won 36 Big Ten and two national titles.

“It gives them 
strength and it 
fires them up.”

“When you sign 
on to Michigan, 
part of it is the 
baseball family.”

“We’re just 

trying to write 
our own chapter 

on Page 149.”

Softball to battle 
Alabama Thursday

By TYLER SCOTT 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan softball team plays 

its first game in the Women’s Col-
lege World Series at 7:00pm Thurs-
day against Alabama, a rematch of a 
preseason two-game set where the 
Wolverines took both games.

Michigan won both times before, 

but that was back in February, a 
long time ago. When the two teams 
last squared off in the Easton Bama 
Bash at Tuscaloosa, there was still 
snow on Alumni field.

But the Wolverines did get a look at 

Crimson Tide pitcher Alexis Osorio in 
the second of those two games back in 
February, and she got a look at them.

Osorio gave up two home runs in 

the third inning to give Michigan 
its second win over Alabama on the 
season, 4-1. Now, that game seems 
like just one win out of many, but 
at the time it was significant for the 
Wolverines.

“I think it 

really started 
clicking when 
we 
were 
at 

Alabama,” said 
sophomore 
right-hander 
Megan Betsa. 
“We 
started 

realizing, 
‘Hey, we’re a 
really 
good 

team. We have 
really good chemistry, and that’s 
something that (Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins) preaches about 
from the very first meeting.”

Since that realization, Michigan 

has swept the Big Ten Champion-
ships and won every postseason 
game along the way to get to the 
WCWS. Alabama does not have the 
conference championships to boast, 
and they dropped the first game of 
their Super Regional series to No. 
11 Oklahoma before punching their 
own ticket to the series.

Osorio threw 241 pitches in last 

Saturday’s doubleheader against 
the Sooners. The Crimson Tide 
weren’t certain they’d have a spot 
reserved in Oklahoma City until 
the sixth inning of the forced game 
three when Infielder Marissa Run-
yon hit a grand slam that allowed 
Alabama to take the lead for good.

The Crimson Tide and the Wol-

verines took different paths to their 
round one WCWS matchup, but 
Michigan isn’t going to underesti-
mate its opponent.

“(Alabama) is a great team,” said 

junior second baseman Sierra Rome-
ro. “They’re a great hitting team and 
they have a great pitching staff as well. 
It’s going to be a good game, and we 
expect every game in the World Series 
to be a good game because it’s the top-
eight teams in the nation now.”

The Wolverines also have the 

added benefit of rest after wrapping 
up the Super Regionals in just two 
games before the weekend. Whether 
Osorio will be at all fatigued by her 
high pitch count remains to be seen, 
but with a 1.68 ERA and opposing bat-
ting average of just .166.

That’s why it might be helpful to 

look back to those early games after all.

All of the four runs Osorio 

allowed against Michigan, includ-
ing the two home runs, came in the 
third inning or earlier. After that, 

she allowed only one 
hit, and nothing else.

Since the postsea-

son, and really all 
year long, Hutchins 
and the Wolverines 
have underlined the 
importance of com-
ing out “attacking” 
and being aggressive 
with every at bat to 
get on base.

“We did well last 

time we saw Alabama’s pitching, 
but again that has no bearing on this 
time,” Hutchins said. “Because Oso-
rio is a lot better. She’s a lot closer 
to the zone, she’s able to nibble the 
zone. I was impressed watching 
her. She was able to keep Oklahoma 
off balance and Oklahoma is a good 
hitting team. So I’m going to have to 
say that runs will be precious.”

The Wolverines will be swinging 

their bats out of the gate like they 
always do. Forty-four of the 76 runs 
that Michigan has scored this post-
season have crossed the plate during 
the first three innings of the game.

Hutchins assumes run will be at 

premium cost. Osorio has the tal-
ent to shut down any lineup in the 
country, but if she slips up early, 
the Wolverines could make her 
pay – just like in February – and it 
wouldn’t matter how well she pitch-
es after that.

Michigan takes down 
’Dogs, on to World Series

By TYLER SCOTT 

Daily Sports Wrter

If anyone thought that just 

because Georgia had been beat-
en soundly the day before that 
it would quietly accept defeat in 
Friday’s second game of the Super 
Regional, they were mistaken.

“That Georgia team,” said 

Michigan 
coach Carol 
Hutchins. 
“They 
are 

fighters, they are scrappy. That’s 
a tough team to play and a tough 
team to beat.”

The Michigan softball team 

had to battle back from an early 
deficit to survive the Bulldog’s 
best efforts, but clinched the the 
victory 7 - 6, and booked itself 
a trip to the Women’s College 
World Series.

“My 
kids 
were 
fantastic. 

They’ve been fantastic all year,” 
Hutchins said. “I’m really proud 
of them. I said, ‘Don’t be proud 
because you won. Be proud of 
what you’ve worked so hard to 
accomplish.’”

Just like Georgia right-hand-

er Chelsea Wilkinson the night 
before, sophomore right-hander 
Megan Betsa was overwhelmed 
by early hitting, and her day was 
done before the first inning was 
over.

In total, Betsa allowed two hits 

in two thirds of an inning pitched. 
Both of them were homers. Geor-

gia first baseman Tina Iosefa put 
the Bulldogs up 3-0 with the sec-
ond long ball of the inning, and 
that was the end for Betsa. At least 
for the time being.

Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins sent out senior left-
hander Haylie Wagner to take 
over in the circle. All eyes were on 
her to give Michigan some time 
before the game got out of reach.

It didn’t take long thanks to 

Kelsey Susalla. The junior right 
fielder put Michigan on the board 
with a solo shot of her own in the 
second inning.

A third inning RBI single hit 

past first base by junior second 
baseman Sierra Romero scored 
another run for Michigan, and a 
comeback was in the works. With 
only one out, junior centerfielder 
Sierra Lawrence, the best Michi-
gan baserunner and the tying 
run, was standing on third.

Sophomore left fielder Kelly 

Christner smacked a 0-1 pitch 
into right field, where Georgia 
outfielder Sydni Emmanuel made 
a spectacular diving grab, but 
couldn’t get to her feet to make 
the throw in time.

Lawrence 
tagged 
up 
and 

scored before any throw at all, 
and the Wolverines breathed a 
collective sigh of relief. 

Susalla was 3-for-3 at the plate 

on the day, and insured Michi-
gan’s lead with a few additional 
runs. She knocked in an RBI dou-
ble in the fifth inning, eventually 

coming around to score herself.

“The coaches were drilling us 

to ‘see the back of the ball hit the 
back of the ball,” Susalla said. “So 
I was just looking for something 
low in the zone and looking to put 
a good swing on the ball.”

After scoring one run to cut 

Michigan’s lead to two, Wag-
ner struck out designated player 
Kaylee Puailoa to end the threat 
in the sixth.

Georgia, after starting the 

game so full of vigor, was down 
to its last hope. After Wagner 
struck out Hugo – the power 
slugger that started it all for the 
Bulldogs – Michigan was on vic-
tory’s doorstep.

The crowd was still roaring 

for Wagner when, without warn-
ing, senior third baseman Anna 
Swafford belted a two-run shot 
past the confines of the center-
field wall.

Wagner went out after seven 

hits and three runs through six 
innings pitched. Betsa came back 
in with the hopes to earn a com-
plete inning on the day in a fash-
ion opposite to how she started.

Griffin popped up. The ball 

arced through the air, and came 
down inside the glove of Romero. 
After a day full of drama, Michi-
gan had finished the job. With 
the final catch Romero ensured 
for her team that the dream of 
making it to the Women’s College 
World Series was now indeed a 
reality.
