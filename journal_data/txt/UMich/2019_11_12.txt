The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
recently 
conducted 
an 
internal 
investigation 
into 
sexual 
harassment 
in 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
termed #MedToo, per the 
recommendations of a 2018 
National Academies study.
The National Academies 
report investigated how 
women 
are 
treated 
in 
science, 
technology, 
engineering 
and 
math 
fields, 
now 
that 
more 
women 
are 
entering 
historically 
male-
dominated 
spaces. 
The 
report 
found 
that 
the 
field 
of 
medicine 
has 
a higher rate of sexual 
harassment 
across 
academic disciplines, with 
female medical students 
experiencing 
sexual 
harassment from faculty 
and staff at a rate 220 
percent higher than female 
students in any non-STEM 
field. The report concluded 
by calling on universities 
to examine the prevelance 
of 
sexual 
harassment 

within their own health 
care institutions.
One of the Michigan 
study’s 
authors, 
Dr. 
Reshma Jagsi, is deputy 
chair of radiation oncology 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine 
and also a co-founder of 
the 
national 
movement, 
Time’s 
Up 
Healthcare. 
In 
an 
interview 
with 
The Daily, Jagsi recalled 
initial conversations with 
the Medical School deans 
regarding the University’s 
response to the national 
study. 
Jagsi explained to the 
administration the risk of 
being the first university 
to 
collect 
and 
publish 
these results; because no 
other 
universities 
had 
conducted 
investigations 
following 
the 
National 
Academies report, readers 
may incorrectly assume 
the issue is specific to 
Michigan Medicine.
“When I talked to our 
deans, Marschall Runge 
and 
Carol 
Bradford, 
they were so incredibly 
supportive of this,” Jagsi 
said. 

Lieutenant 
General 
James Clapper, Lieutenant 
General Michael K. Nagata 
and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, 
D-Lansing, participated in 
a panel at the Ford School 
of Public Policy Monday 
night on national security, 
public service and foreign 
policy.
In an auditorium packed 
with more than 200 people, 
the 
national 
security 
experts honored Veteran’s 
Day 
by 
discussing 
the 
value of service and the 
greatest 
challenges 
the 
U.S. 
national 
security 

apparatus faces today. 
According to Lt. Gen. 
Nagata, 
his 
decades 
of 
service had a profound 
impact on the ways in 
which 
he 
approached 
policy challenges over the 
course of his intelligence 
career 
at 
the 
National 
Counterterrorism Center. 
In 
facing 
constantly 
changing 
global 
and 
political dynamics, Nagata 
says today’s intelligence 
and elected officials should 
modify the ways in which 
they view the very concept 
of service.
“How 
I 
defined 
that 
word, service, when I first 
joined the military in 1981 is 
not the same way in which 
I view that word today,” 

Nagata said. “My view of 
that word now is much 
larger. It’s subordinating 
what 
I 
may 
wish 
for 
personally, or what my 
family and loved ones may 
need, for a purpose that is 
more important than me or 
even my family.” 
In an interview with 
The 
Daily, 
Nagata 
explained 
changing 
domestic politics — namely 
political polarization and 
increased partisanship — 
have complicated public 
servants’ ability to work 
together 
and 
problem-
solve in order to respond to 
shifting global dynamics. 
“Our ability to do things 
effectively internationally 
requires 
both 
sides 
of 

the political spectrum of 
the U.S. government to 
find ways to compromise 
enough that they can work 
together,” 
Nagata 
said. 
“Our ability to compromise 
politically 
has 
been 
steadily eroding for a very 
long time.”
Both Nagata and Clapper 
agreed that the current 
political atmosphere has 
also made the job of public 
servants 
difficult, 
as 
political pressures applied 
by 
the 
president 
and 
other partisan forces have 
attempted 
to 
politicize 
the jobs of intelligence 
officials.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The 
Senate 
Advisory 
Committee on University 
Affairs 
representatives 
met 
in 
the 
Fleming 
Administrative 
Building 
to discuss University of 
Michigan 
funding 
and 
challenges 
facing 
the 
University library system 
and the University Press on 
Monday afternoon.
James Hilton, University 
librarian 
and 
dean 
of 
libraries, 
and 
Charles 
Watkinson, director of the 
U-M Press, both attended 

the meeting to offer insights 
and answer questions from 
faculty representatives.
The 
first 
topic 
of 
discussion was open access, 
or the ability for University 
faculty and students to get 
access to research materials 
and e-books without facing 
a paywall.
“The way that I think 
people here have tended 
to talk about open access 
— and (the way) people in 
library communities tend 
to talk about open access 
— is as almost a moral right 
of readers to have access to 
information,” Hilton said.

According 
to 
Hilton, 
the 
issue 
of 
copyrights 
is related to open access. 
Copyrights 
can 
often 
hinder the ability of the 
University to gain access to 
potential library resources. 
Hilton says the issue of 
copyrights is something all 
universities must contend 
with in developing their 
library systems, and one 
that is more complex than 
many would assume. 
“Lots of people think 
that the only things that 
are 
copywritten 
are 
things that are formally 
published, or things that 

you 
attach 
a 
copyright 
notice to, or something like 
that,” Hilton said. “That is 
not true. If I sit down right 
now and take that piece 
of paper and write some 
new creative expression, it 
is protected by copyright 
from the moment that I 
write it.”
Hilton also addressed a 
recent push to enter into an 
agreement with the other 13 
Big Ten universities which 
could reduce the costs of 
publishing and purchasing 
library 
resources 
like 
e-books.

Study finds medicine has higher rate of 
sexual misbehavior than other fields 

The Office of Institutional 
Equity released two annual 
reports related to faculty and 
staff sexual misconduct and 
prohibited 
student 
conduct 
Monday. Both reports reveal 
decreased numbers of sexual 
misconduct claims submitted 
to OIE.
Since 2013, OIE has published 
annual 
reports 
on 
student 
sexual misconduct to disclose 
information about how many 
instances of sexual misconduct 
are reported to the University 
each year. Last year, OIE began 
releasing an additional annual 
report on instances of sexual 
misconduct 
perpetrated 
by 
faculty, staff and third parties. 
The 
University’s 
sexual 
misconduct policy, and OIE’s 
handling of sexual misconduct 
cases, have been under debate 
for more than a year. This 
past January, the University 
amended its sexual misconduct 
policy 
to 
incorporate 
an 
in-person hearing after the 
U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruled that a student 
must be given an opportunity 
to cross-examine the accuser. 
The University has also spent 
$1.6 million defending against 
the Doe v. Baum lawsuit, which 
alleges the University’s policies 
violate due process of those 
accused of sexual misconduct. 

The report on prohibited 
student conduct found that 
between July 1, 2018 and June 
30, 2019, OIE received 272 
reports 
of 
actions 
labelled 
“prohibited conduct” — 126 
of which were sexual assault 
claims. 
According 
to 
the 
University Record, this is 23 
fewer sexual assault claims 
than were reported last year. 
In total, the number of reports 
decreased slightly from 277 last 
year to 272 this year.
In October, the results of 
a campus climate survey and 
a Division of Public Safety 
and 
Security 
report 
found 
differences in rates of sexual 
misconduct 
for 
minority 
students, women, members of 
the LGBTQ+ community and 
students with disabilities. The 
DPSS report also noted the 
number of reported on-campus 
sexual assaults increased in 
2018 from previous years.
In 
the 
report, 
OIE 
also 
discusses 
how 
reports 
were 
addressed 
and 
offers 
educational and preventative 
measures to counter sexual 
misconduct. Jeffery Frumkin, 
associate 
vice 
provost 
and 
interim senior director of OIE, 
told 
the 
University 
Record 
more information about how to 
report instances of misconduct 
have 
changed 
reporting 
patterns in the past few years.

About 15 students and 
community 
members 
came 
to 
hear 
USS 
Liberty Survivor Larry 
L. Bowen speak at the 
Michigan League about 
the true story of the USS 
Liberty incident on June 
8, 1967. This event was 
sponsored by the Veteran 
and 
Military 
Services 
in 
conjunction 
with 
Veterans Week sponsored 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan. 
Bowen 
is 
a 
Purple 
Heart 
recipient 
for 
his service on the USS 
Liberty incident. Philip 
Larson, program director 
for Veteran and Military 
Services, 
introduced 
Bowen 
before 
talking 
about the USS Liberty 

incident. Bowen is part 
of 
the 
USS 
Liberty 
Veterans 
Association, 
an organization that has 
spent the past 55 years 
telling their first hand 
accounts of USS Liberty 
attack.
There 
were 
34 
American 
casualties 
on the USS Liberty on 
June 8, 1967, caused by 
torpedo 
and 
bombing 
attacks from the Israeli 
Defense Forces on the 
Mediterranean 
Sea. 
The event was officially 
considered an accident 
by both countries. Israel 
apologized 
and 
paid 
the 
victims’ 
families 
compensation, according 
to Haaretz. 
According to Bowen, 
the U.S. Government told 
the survivors of the attack 
to never mention the USS 

Liberty 
incident 
and 
that the government has 
maintained this position 
— even today, he said, the 
issue is currently being 
treated this way. 
“I 
feel 
like 
a 
man 
without 
a country because the 
government is refusing 
to 
acknowledge 
what 
happened,” Bowen said. 
“And then after the attack, 
we were told never to 
talk about it or we would 
be threatened with fines 
or imprisonment. For all 
this time, we’ve not been 
allowed to speak, been 
treated 
like 
criminals 
and we’re still not getting 
support.”
“Justice 
for 
the 
Liberty,” a documentary 
about the USS Liberty 
incident, 
was 
shown 
during the event. The 
documentary 
included 
personal 
accounts 
from 
USS 
Liberty 
survivors 
James 
Ennes, 
Richard 
Keipher, 
Larry 
Weaver and Ernest 
Gallo. 
Kurt Hill, retired 
Veteran 
liaison 
for the College of 
Engineering, 
told 
The 
Daily 
that 
the 
movie 
really 
showed how the USS 
Liberty 
survivors 
did everything they 
were supposed to do 
for the country and 
how they were let 
down. 
“I 
liked 
the 
historical 
events 
to 
look 
at 
how 
our 
servicemen 
did their job and 
were kind of left 
hanging in there,” 
Hill said. “National 
security 
and 
that 
whole operation put 
in 
effort 
for 
(the 
story) to not be told 

and that was the most 
important part.”
The 
movie 
also 
discussed post traumatic 
stress 
disorder 
and 
how 
it 
affected 
the 
lives of the USS Liberty 
survivors. Bowen shared 
his own story of how he 
discovered he had PTSD.
“I’m one of the late 
respondents 
of 
PTSD, 
never knew I had it,” 
Bowen said. “I walked in 
to talk to the psychiatrist 
and she asked some of the 
difficult questions that 
(people in the movie) 
were talking about and 
she says ‘Larry, you’ve 
got PTSD’. I guess I 
never really heard of the 
term before, so it was 
completely new to me.”
At the event, Bowen 
brought 
many 
books 
and 
pamphlets 
with 
information 
about 
his 
account 
of 
the 
USS 
Liberty incident. There 
were some books written 
by survivors of the event, 
including 
Ennes, 
who 
wrote about his first-
hand account in his novel 
“Assault on Liberty.”
LSA junior Matthew 
Iamarino also told The 
Daily that he hopes this 
talk will spread the word 
about the USS Liberty 
incident and bring justice 
to the survivors. 
“I was very happy to see 
the USS Liberty incident 
event on the email for 
Veterans Day. I was very 
excited 
to 
see 
that,” 
Iamarino said. “It’s been 
50 years since the event 
occurred and the people 
on the ship still have 
not received justice. So 
hopefully more talks like 
this will bring attention 
to the event and we’ll be 
able to speak about what 
happened that day.”

USS Liberty incident survivor talks 
experience in honor of Veterans Day
Purple Heart recipient Larry L. Bowen reflects on military experiences

JASMIN LEE
Daily Staff Reporter 


“We 
believe 
that 
the 
dramatic 
increase 
in 
reporting 
last 
year 
and 
subsequent 
decrease 
this 
year represents stabilization 
of reporting following the 
significant 
attention 
and 
raised awareness at U-M of 
these issues and how to report 
concerns,” Frumkin said.
When contacted by The 
Daily, a representative from 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center 

declined to comment on the 
report on behalf of SAPAC. 
The report on faculty and 
staff 
sexual 
misconduct 
also 
revealed 
a 
decrease 
in the number of reports 
from the year before. In the 
fiscal year 2019, 178 reports 
of 
misconduct 
by 
faculty 
and staff were submitted to 
OIE, while 235 reports were 
made last year. In the report, 
Frumkin said as the University 
works to create an umbrella 
policy for students, faculty 
and staff, they will most likely 
begin publishing only one 
report discussing all claims 
in the future. In October, the 

University officially released 
its draft umbrella policy. 
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
said 
these reports are released 
each year to make issues of 
sexual misconduct, and the 
University’s response to these 
claims, more widely known 
across the University.
“We share this information 
in order to be transparent, 
to acknowledge that these 
behaviors occur within our 
community, 
and 
to 
show 
how the university responds 
to 
sexual 
misconduct,” 
Broekhuizen wrote.

“First of all they said, 
‘Absolutely 
you 
should 
do this. This is what the 
national academies is calling 
for, we have the expertise 
here, we should lead the 
way.’”
The researchers surveyed 
faculty 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine 
using 
validated 
measures 
adapted 
from 
the 
Sexual 
Experiences 
Questionnaire, 
and 
examined the experiences 
of men and women in the 
field, distinguishing sexual 
harassment 
perpetrators 
between 
insiders 
(staff, 
students and faculty), and 
patients or patient family 
members. 
At 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
the study writes, “82.5% of 
women and 65.1% of men, 
reported at least one incident 
of sexual harassment from 
insiders in the past year.”
Esther 
Choo, 
associate 
professor 
in 
emergency 
medicine at Oregon Health 
& Science University, is one 
of the founders of Time’s Up 
Healthcare. Choo’s greatest 
concern about the study 

is its fairly low response 
rate, which indicates the 
possibility of participation 
bias. 
“I would also say that 
the rates were so high, 
that even if in the unlikely 
circumstance 
that 
every 
single person who didn’t 
respond to the study had 
never experienced sexual 
harassment, 
(the 
results) 
would still be significant,” 
Choo said.
The 
rates 
of 
gender 
harassment are far more 
prevalent 
than 
sexual 
coercion at Michigan and 
nationwide, 
according 
to 
the 
study. 
#MedToo 
states 
82.2 
percent 
of 
women 
experienced 
gender 
harassment 
from 
insiders, and 64 percent of 
women experienced gender 
harassment from patients or 
patient families within the 
past year. On the contrary, 
only 0.6 percent of women 
experienced sexual coercion 
from insiders in the past 
year. 
“Even though we may 
think 
that 
they’re 
less 
consequential 
than 
the 
egregious behaviors that we 
tend to focus on, the Harvey 
Weinstein-type 
aggressors 

in our society organizational, 
psychologists 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
those 
gender 
harassment 
behaviors 
are 
actually 
associated with meaningful 
impact on any point we care 
about: physical well-being, 
psychological 
well-being 
and on professional well-
being,” Jagsi said.
Kate Brown, a fourth-year 
Medical student involved 
with 
sexual 
harassment 
education in the medical 
school, was not suprised by 
the overall findings of the 
study, but explained that 
this study did provide a 
new perspective into how 
the #MeToo era is also 
empowering men.
“It’s 
been 
expected 
that men just enjoy those 
things, and that it’s just 
part of being a man, but I 
think it’s probably always 
bothered 
people,” 
Brown 
said. “I think finally in the 
context of #MeToo, men 
are being empowered to say, 
‘You know, this really is not 
okay.’”
Although 
#MedToo 
examined 
the 
impacts 
of sexual harassment on 
men in addition to women, 
it 
did 
not 
examine 
the 

impacts on indivuals with 
intersectional identities. 
“This 
is 
the 
first 
of 
many, many papers that 
will come out of this …” 
Jagsi said. “There will be 
separate analyses that will 
look at the intersection of 
race and gender, looking at 
the intersection of sexual 
orientation 
and 
gender, 
those are coming.”
However, 
Choo 
cautions that researchers 
must 
consider 
specific 
aspects 
when 
collecting 
intersectional 
data, 
explaining 
that 
despite 
inclusive intentions, it may 
end up isolating those who 
responded. Choo gave the 
example that if there were 
only five Black gay women 
in an institution, reporting 
on their responses would 
threaten their anonymity. 
“Those 
with 
intersectional 
experiences 
in healthcare are in the 
minority, and so you want to 
protect the most vulnerable 
… so sometimes we try to 
highlight 
intersectional 
experiences, and what we’ve 
done is violate principles of 
privacy and confidentiality,” 
Choo said.
In 
addition 
to 
intersectional 
identities, 
sexual harassment occurs 
in 
spaces 
where 
gender 
inequity is present more 
generally. 
At 
Michigan 
Medicine, the student body 
has been more than 40 
percent women for the past 
25 years, however women 
are still underrepresented 
in 
leadership 
positions, 
Jagsi said. Jagsi explains 
this lack of gender equity 
is both a cause and effect 
of 
gender 
harassment; 
when few women are in 
leadership positions, gender 
harassment 
prevails 
and 
discourages other women 
from moving up in the 
ranks.
Jagsi called for a change 
in 
leadership 
to 
change 
the 
culture 
of 
sexual 
harassment.
“Equity 
is 
essential,” 
Jagsi said. “So we need 
to 
hire 
more 
women, 
promote more women, and 
insure 
that 
women 
are 
represented at all levels of 

our organization, and in all 
positions of authority and 
influence.”
Fourth-year 
Medical 
student Anitha Menon also 
reflected 
on 
the 
issues 
of gender inequity in an 

interview with The Daily.
“I can only imagine that 
that level of harassment 
amplifies as you progress 
up the career ladder and are 
more and more isolated,” 
Menon said. “Statistically 
speaking, 
there 
are 
women, and in particular 
women 
of 
color, 
really 
underrepresented in higher 
levels 
of 
the 
academic 
ladder, especially in tenured 
professorships.”
Menon said many medical 
students have taken it upon 
themselves 
to 
catalyze 
change 
in 
the 
culture 
of sexual harassment at 
Michigan Medicine.
“My 
real 
interest 
has 
always 
been 
to 
try 
to 
educate medical students 
on the prevalance of sexual 
harassment and its impacts 
on medical students — in 

particular, again, women of 
color, queer women, trans 
folks — because I feel like 
medical students are not — 
we don’t really recieve that 
kind of education, and we’re 
definitely not taught skills 
of how to intervene in sexual 
harassment,” Menon said.
Similarly, 
Brown 
is 
involved 
with 
addressing 
sexual 
harassment 
in 
Michigan Medicine through 
a 
student 
organization 
created by her and her 
classmates, 
SafeMD. 

Originally 
focused 
on 
medical 
students, 
the 
organization has expanded 
to 
also 
teach 
medical 
students how to help patients 
that 
have 
experienced 
sexual harassment or abuse. 
Brown said she believes 
Michigan Medicine is taking 
a step in the right direction 
through 
conducting 
this 
study. But she also believes 
the toxic environment of 
sexual 
harassment 
needs 
to be addressed by both 
students and administrators.
“I think reducing sexual 
harassment has to come both 
from the bottom up, where 
there’s 
grassroots 
efforts 
for people on the ground 
— whether that’s students 
or faculty — to demand 
change and also to step up 
as bystanders, but I also 
think it needs to come from 
the top down,” Brown said. 
“Institutional 
leadership 
needs to say, ‘Harassment 
is not okay,’ and then needs 
to take steps to make sure 
it doesn’t happen, and then 
make sure that if it does 
happen, that situation is not 
tolerated,” Brown said.
Menon 
said 
when 
she 
spoke 
with 
University 
administrators, they were 
open to student feedback on 
how to combat the current 
environment.
“They 
want 
student 
involvement 
and 
student 
ideas on how to address 
sexual harassment,” Menon 
said. “When I presented 
this to some of the folks 
who 
are 
involved 
with 
the 
curriculum, 
they 
were really interested in 
potentially, 
potentially, 
incorporating it into the 
curriculum.”

According to Hilton, this 
policy — while seemingly 
appealing 
 
— 
could 
disadvantage U-M more than 
other Big Ten schools.
“It’s probably pretty easy 
to assume that across the Big 
Ten, we’re all kind of readers,” 
Hilton said. “So if you just 
take iPads, and you split up 
the consortium subscription 
by bodies, you get a pretty fair 
distribution. That is not true 
if you shift pay for publishing. 
We publish disproportionately 
more. So even if we went in 
with a consortium agreement 
with 
the 
Big 
Ten, 
what 
Michigan might have to pay 
would be very different.”
Hilton also discussed the 
University Press, which he 
explained is an important tool 
for a university to improve 
its reputation, rather than 
simply a means of bringing in 
revenue.
“I 
would 
argue 
the 
University 
presses 
collectively 
provide 
the 
infrastructure that supports 
scholarly publishing in the 
humanities and humanistic 
social sciences,” Hilton said. 

“Historically, that has been 
based on the notion that you 
can sell enough books to make 
back costs. That is not true 
now and has not been true 
for the majority of presses for 
quite some time.”
Hilton explained because 
of this challenge of meeting 
costs, the University must 
find other sources of revenue, 
whether from donations or 
receiving a larger portion of 
the University’s endowment.
“(The fact) that there are 
100 presses out there is really 
important for the humanities 
and social sciences,” Hilton 
said. “So our proposal is 
basically over time, we have 
to find a way to fund the press 
commission. What do I mean 
by that? I mean we need to 
figure out what it costs to 
publish 90 or so manuscripts 
a year, books a year. And 
what would you need in base 
funding to support that?”
Watkinson also provided 
input 
on 
the 
challenges 
facing the University Press, 
arguing that depending on 
the discipline, the University 
faces 
competition 
from 
several other presses.
“African 
Studies, 
for 
example, it would be the 
Ohio University Press, which 

is not a very well-known 
press elsewhere,” Watkinson 
said. 
“Political 
science 
is 
interesting because it’s a lot of 
commercial publishers now — 
Routledge, Palgrave. Classics, 
I think we often lose books to 
Cambridge University Press. 
So it does depend on the 
discipline, who the competing 
press would be.”
Following the committee’s 
conversation 
with 
Hilton 
and Watkinson, the session 
concluded with a unanimous 
vote to approve e-voting for 
faculty senate, which would 
expedite the decision making 
process of Senate Assembly. 
SACUA member Neil Marsh 
explained how this policy 
would make it easier for 
members to vote on important 
proposals, especially if they 
could not be present at votes 
themselves.
“Basically this in a way of 
asking the Senate just to green 
light a move into the 21st 
century which had become 
hamstrung by the quorum 
rule, (which is that) you can’t 
change the rules because you 
never get enough people,” 
Marsh said. “So this is a way 
to eventually be able to give 
more of the faculty more 
saying opinion.”

“There’s always been 
an aura of suspicion about 
intelligence 
anyway,” 
Clapper 
said. 
“That’s 
inherent because of its 
secrecy, and there has to 
be a certain amount of 
secrecy involved with the 
conduct of intelligence. 
If 
there’s 
no 
secrecy, 
you know, you’re out of 
luck. So the atmosphere 
now has amplified that 
suspicion 
and 
all 
the 
references to the deep 
state, the whistleblower 
complainant 
being 
a 
member of the intelligence 
community. 
All 
that 
contributes 
to 
— 
even 
heightens — the suspicion 
and, 
unfortunately, 
distrust.”
Beyond the intelligence 
community, 
Slotkin 
spoke 
about 
how 
her 
experience 
serving 
in 
the military informs her 
mission-driven approach 
to policy-making against 
the 
backdrop 
of 
an 
increasingly 
polarized 
political climate.
“My 
service 
really 
colors how I view other 
people,”Slotkin 
said. 
“When I walk into a room, 
and we’re talking about the 
issue of an impeachment 
inquiry, and there’s one 
side who’s just chomping 
at the bit to make political 
hay out of it, and the other 
side is rejecting the whole 
thing 
and 
refusing 
to 
acknowledge (the other 
side’s perspective), all I 
can think of is: where is 
your sense of mission of 
what we’re trying to do 
to protect and defend the 
Constitution?” 
The panel as a whole 
spoke to the importance 
of integrating values into 

American 
institutions 
to ensure that citizens’ 
physical safety does not 
come at the cost of their 
rights, beliefs, and ways 
of life. Lt. Gen. Nagata 
said Americans need to 
more passionately engage 
in 
conversations 
about 
how 
the 
intelligence 
community 
should 
balance American values 
against the need to combat 
the growth of domestic 
terrorism. 

“We 
are 
seeing 
a 
significant 
growth 
of 
all 
forms 
of 
violent 
extremism 
within 
the 
United States… I hope 
that the United States 
as a government and as 
a people start becoming 
more 
energetic 
about 
a debate,” Nagata said. 
“How do we reconcile 
these 
very 
important 
values, 
privacy 
rights, 

constitutional 
rights, 
societal norms… versus 
the 
need 
to 
ensure 
the safety of our own 
people 
against 
violent 
extremists?” 
The 
panelists 
each 
highlighted both physical 
and 
international 
threats 
to 
national 
security. 
Lieutenant 
Generals 
Clapper 
and 
Nagata pointed towards 
terrorism, 
China 
and 
Russia 
as 
menaces 
as 
well as an assault on 
institutions that support 
truth 
and 
the 
erosion 
of 
confidence 
between 
populations 
and 
their 
governments. 
They 
agreed 
the 
United 
States 
military 
must 
become 
more 
agile, 
adaptable 
and 
risk-tolerant in order to 
confront 
21st 
century 
challenges. 
“The 
United 
States 
military has to get better 
at training and educating 
for 
complexity 
and 
uncertainty,” Nagata said. 
“We need to inculcate a 
tradition in the United 
States 
military… 
(that 
21st century threats are) 
an 
incredibly 
complex, 
multi-dimensional 
security challenge, there 
is no solution, there is no 
answer.” 
Though 
panelists 
were 
concerned 
about 
young people’s declining 
interest in military and 
government service, LSA 
junior Noa Sreden shared 
her excitement for the 
panelists’ discussion.
“I think they’re very 
unique 
perspectives 
that the presenters give, 
especially 
on 
foreign 
policy,” 
Sreden 
said. 
“That’s something that’s 
pretty unique and goes 
above what we typically 
learn here in Michigan.”

Less suppression, more representation

MAX STEINBAUM | COLUMN

Jefferson, Hamilton and Hong Kong

A 

revolutionary tide began 
to wash over France in 
1789. Across the Atlantic, 
the American public — 
fresh off its own war 
of independence that 
had ended only six 
years prior — watched 
the early stages of the 
revolution unfold with 
a sense of republican 
solidarity. In 1793, the 
revolutionary French 
government executed 
King Louis XVI and 
prepared 
for 
war 
with Great Britain. The nascent 
American republic faced its most 
pressing foreign policy question 
yet: Should the United States, 
ideologically sympathetic to the 
revolutionaries, 
champion 
the 
French war effort? Or, should the 
U.S. pursue the more strategic 
policy of military neutrality?
The conflict pitted two of the 
era’s political giants, Secretary 
of 
State 
Thomas 
Jefferson 
and Secretary of the Treasury 
Alexander Hamilton, in a bid 
for the support of President 
George Washington. Jefferson, 
a 
Democratic-Republican 
and staunch supporter of the 
revolutionaries, 
argued 
the 
United States’ republican ideals 
necessitated support of France. 
Hamilton, a Federalist, promoted 
non-intervention, 
casting 
the 
revolution as anarchic chaos 
and emphasizing the value of 
America’s commercial ties to 
Britain. Washington eventually 
sided with his fellow Federalist, 
and in April 1793 issued a 
Proclamation of Neutrality. Even 
if most Americans supported 
France’s 
efforts 
against 
monarchical Britain, the United 
States would not commit troops to 
its cause.
The struggle between Jefferson 
and Hamilton was as philosophical 
as it was political. Hamilton, a 
supreme pragmatist, felt that 
1793 America was too susceptible 
to mob rule to participate in a 
European war. More importantly, 
he recognized that a policy 
of intervention on behalf of 
democratic 
movements, 
even 
if noble, could force the United 
States into perpetual war around 
the globe. Jefferson, informed 
by a sense of Enlightenment 

idealism, believed America had 
an existential duty to promote the 
spread of democracy around the 
world. 
Policymakers 
and 
the 
public 
have grappled over 
whether idealism or 
pragmatic realpolitik 
ought 
to 
inform 
American 
foreign 
policy 
since 
our 
nation’s 
founding. 
226 years later, the 
debate has witnessed 
a flare-up over the 
United States’ posture towards 
the ongoing Hong Kong protests. 
As the streets of Hong Kong flood 
with pro-democracy protesters 
angered by Beijing’s crackdown 
on the city’s autonomy, the 
question of to what degree the U.S. 
should support Hongkongers pits 
idealism against pragmatism.
As believers in democracy and 
free speech — and viewing the 
United States as a defender of 
these rights — some Hong Kong 
protesters have publicly waved 
the Stars and Stripes and sung 
the Star Spangled Banner. Others 
have even “chanted pleas for the 
U.S. to ‘liberate’ Hong Kong” from 
Chinese oppression, according to 
a BBC report. It’s clear that these 
Hongkongers look in part to the 
United States as a champion of their 
aims and want to inspire feelings 
of 
camaraderie 
in 
American 
audiences over our shared ideals.
The Hongkongers’ pleas have 
not fallen on deaf ears. American 
lawmakers of all stripes have 
voiced their support for Hong 
Kong’s autonomy, viewing the 
protection of its democratic society 
a responsibility of the free West. In 
September, Sen. Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., warned Beijing that violent 
suppression of Hong Kong’s rights 
would be unacceptable, stating that 
it would require “America, which is 
known internationally for standing 
up for human rights … to take 
more forceful action.” Former Vice 
President Joe Biden also defined 
America’s responsibilities to Hong 
Kong in idealistic terms, saying last 
June that “all of us must stand in 
support of democratic principles 
and freedom.”
The White House, however, 
has 
taken 
a 
contradictory 
stance towards the democratic 

movement. 
While 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
expressed 
goodwill 
towards 
the 
Hong 
Kong protesters and condemned 
China’s crackdown in an address 
to the U.N. in September, he also 
“promised Chinese president Xi 
Jinping that the U.S. would remain 
quiet” on the Hong Kong turmoil 
during summer trade talks. 
Clearly, 
Trump’s 
rhetorical 
support of the protests has 
been 
tempered 
by 
practical 
considerations of how his words 
will impact trade with Beijing. 
Even if America’s sympathies lie 
with the Hong Kong protesters, 
idealist 
policy 
could 
prove 
destructive to trade arrangements.
Trump’s lukewarm approach, 
rooted 
in 
realpolitik, 
has 
evidently not been championed by 
Congress. On Oct. 15, the House 
of Representatives unanimously 
passed the Hong Kong Human 
Rights and Democracy Act, a 
measure reaffirming American 
commitment 
to 
the 
region’s 
integrity. A similar version of the 
bill exists in the Senate, and is 
sponsored by both Democrats and 
Republicans.
That the bill has enjoyed such 
an 
outpouring 
of 
bipartisan 
support in our hopelessly polarized 
times speaks volumes as to its 
significance: 
It 
represents 
a 
situation in which America will 
either rise to its democratic ideals, 
or will shy away from them out of 
political expediency. 
It boils down to a simple 
question: Is America to stand 
up to China and make good on 
its dedication to freedom? As 
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fl., echoed 
in August, “We have to decide: 
Do we want to be a defender of 
democracy?”
Jefferson — and really anyone 
who values America’s role as a 
moral lighthouse — would respond 
to Rubio with a resounding yes. 
There are few situations in our 
world today that so obviously 
present the chance to stand for 
democracy against authoritarian 
encroachment. 
Come what may of our challenge 
to Beijing. Across the Pacific, 
American flags are waving. If we 
ignore them, what do we stand for?

n North Carolina, a state 
court ruled a previously 
drawn 
district 
map 
unconstitutional on the basis 
that the constructed lines were 
blatantly partisan. This is just 
one example of the ongoing 
gerrymandering problem that has 
invaded our electoral system and 
unfairly displaced voter choices 
for the sake of party power.
Gerrymandering 
entails 
redrawing congressional district 
lines to sway elections in favor of 
certain parties, which suppresses 
voters’ voices. Voters of one party 
become a majority in some districts, 
ultimately handing that party a 
guaranteed vote. The outcome of 
more and more districts engaged 
in gerrymandering becomes all 
but predetermined, undermining 
the democratic process. The North 
Carolina court’s latest ruling is not 
only a win for voters, but also can set 
a precedent for strictly regulating 
the future of gerrymandering to 
ensure a fairer democratic process. 
Our electoral system does not need 
any further interference. With 
Russian meddling in our 2016 
presidential election still fresh in our 
minds, we should strive to preserve 
the integrity of our democracy and 
work harder to value the voices of 
the people.
When the U.S. Supreme Court 
stated it would not take action 
on state gerrymandering cases 
this summer, it felt like a win for 
Republicans. With a conservative 
judicial majority sitting on the Court 
and gerrymandering historically 
giving Republicans an advantage, 
it seemed like Republicans would 
get away with rigging election 
outcomes. This meant several of 
the heavily manipulated states 
would stay weighted unfairly to 
Republicans and would be subject 
to extreme gerrymandering prior to 
key elections.
At this point, it feels like 
politicians will do anything to hold 
on to their seats of power, going 
so far as to disregard the purpose 
of the government we have 

established. America prides itself 
so much on being a democracy, yet 
we seem to be falling far from it as 
the next election looms. If a certain 
outcome is already secured, the 
votes of some become meaningless, 
so why bother holding elections? 
Manipulating which districts votes 
are counted for is undemocratic 
and clearly violates “one person, 
one vote” — if you can’t win fairly, 
then you clearly don’t deserve the 
seat.
However, there may still be 
some hope for our broken system, 
as Democrats have found a way 
to 
challenge 
gerrymandering: 
appealing to state courts. North 
Carolina 
ordered 
the 
district 
map to be redrawn for the 2020 
election after the state court’s 
judgment, which is a win for 
Democrats and voters alike. Since 
the Supreme Court delegated 
states the authority to decide on 
their own gerrymandering cases, 
approaching it at the state level 

could potentially benefit those who 
live in states subject to extreme 
gerrymandering. Districts with 
absurdly-drawn maps could be 
reversed if state courts rule them 
invalid. Voters would then have 
their votes counted meaningfully 
and 
their 
interests 
fairly 
represented. If anything, it loosens 
the Republican grip on election 
outcomes and restores some honor 
to our democracy.
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
is 
also 
important 
to 
remember 
Republicans are not the only 
ones guilty of gerrymandering. 

Maryland 
is 
an 
example 
of 
Democrats’ 
own 
attempts 
at 
gerrymandering, where they tried 
to take back a seat that had turned 
Republican by redrawing the 
district to include more Democratic 
voters in the district. Even in the 
North Carolina case, is hard to 
completely believe Democrats had 
no partisan motivations. It happens 
that voters’ rights and interests 
are also upheld when challenging 
Republican-drawn district maps.
With 
the 
upcoming 
2020 
elections, there is a lot riding on 
which party will control the House 
of Representatives, given that the 
presidential election is occurring 
at the same time. On one hand, if 
other district maps are challenged 
in state courts, questioning their 
legitimacy could give candidates 
running a fair chance at previously 
uncontestable seats. Furthermore, 
voters would have a chance to 
have their voices accounted for 
properly.
While the Supreme Court is 
reluctant to set standards for 
gerrymandering 
because 
the 
question of what a “fair” district 
looks like is a subjective one, 
there still needs to be a way to 
fairly determine congressional 
districts. District lines should 
be separated from party lines; 
some states employ nonpartisan 
commissions to help draw their 
districts. Since there is no way to 
ensure anyone who is politically 
affiliated will produce a fair map, 
these committees employ a mix 
of partisan commissioners to 
keep each other in check. While 
there is a National Democratic 
Redistricting Committee, there 
should be an independent version 
to help states draw and maintain 
fair district lines. To keep our 
electoral process from corruption 
and preserve its integrity, we 
need to work harder to make sure 
that our elections can uphold the 
values of our democracy.

FROM THE DAILY

Katie Hill and scandal in the social media age
I

n the last week of October, Democratic Rep. Katie Hill of 
California’s 25th District gave a farewell speech as she resigned 
following allegations that she had a sexual relationship with a 
member of her congressional staff. Hill was elected nearly a year ago 
and was seen as a rising star in the Democratic party. Though Hill 
resigned after the House Ethics Committee announced an inquiry into 
the allegations, she maintains her innocence while acknowledging a 
relationship with a member of her campaign team. Relations between 
candidates and campaign team members are not covered by House rules. 

Despite 
her 
denial 
of 
sexual 
relations 
with 
a 
congressional staff member, 
Hill chose to resign because 
of the inappropriate nature 
of 
her 
relationship 
with 
her 
campaign 
staffer. 
However, her private life was 
sensationalized by right-wing 
media stemming from her 
estranged husband’s release 
of her nude photos with a 
campaign staffer. Hill and 
her husband, Kenny Heslep, 
are 
currently 
in 
divorce 
proceedings. 
This 
use 
of 
revenge porn, or the public 
release of private sexual media 
without the consent of those 
they depict, is a shameful 
tactic of abuse. It is this 
abuse – not the affair alone – 
that led to the outpouring of 
misogynistic rhetoric against 
Hill and her female staffer. 
The double standard that Hill 
was subjected to throughout 
the ordeal is a demonstration 
of the hardships that women 
have to endure when they 
obtain positions of power. 
Hill’s 
resignation 
is 
a 
resulted 
from 
her 
acknowledgment of what she 
views as an inappropriate 
relationship with a campaign 
staffer. While her decision to 
engage in such a relationship 
may have been misguided, 
the actions of her estranged 
husband 
deserve 
more 
scrutiny. Not only is revenge 
porn illegal in many states, 
including 
California, 
it 
is 
also a clear violation of Hill’s 
privacy and dignity. Heslep’s 
actions are far more shameful 
than Hill’s and are far more 
deserving of criticism and 
legal reprimand. Yet, when 
the photographs were first 
released, right-wing websites 
such as RedState spread the 
images in an attempt to smear 
Hill’s reputation. The abusive 
nature of these actions cannot 
be overstated. Hill’s estranged 
husband violated her as an 

individual in an attempt to 
blackmail her. Far-right media 
outlets then pounced upon 
this violation, publicizing her 
intimate moments as a means 
of invalidating her and her 
position of power.
Hill’s circumstances bring 
to light the significant media 
presence of new generations of 
politicians that will be elected. 
Because these new politicians 
are growing up with modern 
technology, social media begs 
the question if we will become 
desensitized 
to 
intimate 
content 
being 
released. 
Given 
that 
the 
internet 
personalizes politicians, and 

how social media platforms 
such as Twitter are one way 
for people to connect with 
and 
understand 
leaders, 
our 
puritanical 
standards 
for politicians may need to 
change. We must also question 
our cultural standards, and 
possibly lower our high social 
standards 
of 
politicians, 
as more and more elected 
officials 
will 
most 
likely 
have 
promiscuous 
content 
somewhere online. It also 
needs to be further discussed 
how 
we 
hold 
officials 
accountable. Where do we 
draw the line between being 
silly and innapropriate on the 
internet? There needs to be 
recognition that the internet 
has a strong influence on 
politicians’ images, and could 
easily cause trouble for them 
in the future. 

It is also integral to note 
that women, people of color 
and LGBTQ+ people will face 
the brunt of this transition. 
Minority groups are often 
smeared 
when 
it 
comes 
politics and face significantly 
more criticism online. We 
have seen instances of past 
videos and photos reemerge 
with elected officials, such 
as the leaked video of Rep. 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., dancing in college 
while wearing conservative 
clothing, 
for 
which 
her 
clothing was criticized for 
being “too nice for a girl 
who 
struggles.” 
Former 
president Barack Obama was 
criticized for a tan suit he 
wore, due to claims of the 
“lack of seriousness” and that 
it was an inappropriate and 
disrespectful 
appearance. 
Many media platforms have 
noted 
that 
Hill 
identifies 
as bisexual, and how that 
specific part of her identity 
contributes to the controversy. 
There were several ethical 
issues with regards to Hill’s 
intimate relationships during 
her time as a representative, as 
power dynamics of intra-office 
relations should be carefully 
monitored. It should be known 
that regardless of technology or 
social media, there is a degree 
of professionalism that needs 
to be endorsed. However, the 
manner in which her mentally-
abusive husband and right-
wing media worked in concert 
to ruin her reputation is clearly 
an act of premeditated abuse. 
These actions mimic what has 
been seen before with current 
and former politicians, which 
reminds the public to be aware 
of 
young 
people 
entering 
office and the lasting digital 
footprints they leave. With 
this in mind, it demands us to 
think about what our internet 
history says about our elected 
officials and in forming our 
digital standards.

The internet has 
a strong influence 
on politicians’ 
images

If you can’t win 
fairly, then you 
clearly don’t 
deserve the seat.

In a world of hip-thrusting Luke Bryans and 
muscular Tim McGraws, Luke Combs stands 
out. Baby-faced and beer-bellied, he looks 
like someone you’d expect to see in the crowd 
of a country music concert, not on the stage. 
But in a genre that claims to represent “real 
people,” that image is a good thing. Following 
a massively successful first album This One’s 
For You, Combs continues to deliver catchy, 
’90s-country-sounding tunes on his sophomore 
effort, What You See Is What You Get. He proves 
himself to be just what today’s Nashville needs 
— a reality check. 
A stomping anthemic love letter to “long 
neck ice-cold beer,” the album opener might 
give listeners the wrong first impression. But 
even 
“Beer 
Never 
Broke 
My 
Heart” 
breaks 
the 
“bro-country” 
mold for its lack 
of scantily-clad 
women and use 
of real drums as 
opposed to snap 
tracks. Further 
dodging 
the 
frat-party 
subgenre 
of 
country, Combs 
quickly 
pivots 
to 
chronicling 
life’s smaller, sweeter moments.
“Refrigerator Door” is an ode to the 
kitchen appliance as a kind of time capsule. 
Combs lovingly details the “Couple magnets, 
recipes and Polaroids” against a simple chord 
progression. In “Even Though I’m Leavin’,” 
Combs follows a father and son from monster-
in-my-closet worries to the father’s deathbed. 
“Even though I’m leavin’ / I ain’t goin’ 
nowhere,” the pair consistently reassure one 
another.
A Brooks & Dunn assist on “1, 2 Many” starts 
the party up again. An uptempo song about 
drinking “5-4-3-2-1, too many” in the style 
they perfected in the ’90s, Combs sounds like 
the perfect addition to make the legendary 
duo a trio. “C’mon that’s a country song right 
there,” Combs concludes in the outro, sounding 

like the harbinger for the next wave of neo-
traditionalism in the genre.
In “New Every Day,” “Reasons” and “Every 
Little Bit Helps” Combs keeps finding new ways 
to rationalize a break-up. However, on a 17-track 
album, a listener doesn’t have time for a three-
song lull stuck in the same thematic problem. All 
lyrically clever and instrumentally sound, they 
make sense on their own, but grouped together 
they can’t help but bleed into one another.
On the title track, “What You See Is What You 
Get,” Combs finally hits his stride. “With me ain’t 
no tricks up these sleeves / An acquired taste 
/ a constant work in progress” Combs admits. 
At this point in the album, it’s easy to get what 
he means. Consistently backed by an electric 
guitar and steady drums, Combs doesn’t make 
room for any surprises. All of his songs exist 
in the same sonic landscape — a modern take 
on ’90s country. But if appreciating that takes 
an 
“acquired 
taste,” 
it’s 
safe 
to 
say 
contemporary 
country 
fans 
are hungry for 
it. 
“All 
Over 
Again” is the 
only track that 
veers into the 
snap-track trap 
of his country 
radio 
peers. 
Still, the chorus 
can’t help but 
explode 
into 
real drums as Combs laments “falling over 
again” for the relationship to be “all over 
again” just as quickly as it started. Ultimately 
Combs can’t give in to pop-country, even when 
he tries. 
What You See Is What You Get confirms 
that Combs knows his lane in country music 
and plans on sticking to it. By not taking any 
genre-bending risks, he takes the greatest risk 
of all — trusting country music to stand on its 
own. And it works. “So say I’m a middle of the 
road / not much to show / underachieving, 
average Joe,” Combs shrugs in “Does to Me.” 
He recognizes the value in being an everyman. 
That’s why listeners are lucky to be getting 
what they see when it comes to Luke Combs. 
A real person.what they see when it comes to 
Luke Combs. A real person.

There’s room for more
than one Luke in country

KATIE BEEKMAN
Daily Arts Writer

In a 2017 essay about Zadie Smith’s recent work, 
the critic Mara Smith posits that the common thread 
running through her first five novels is her use of “an 
omniscient narrator able to hold multiple voices in 
suspension.” For Mara Smith, these novels are mostly 
concerned with balancing disparate voices, cultures 
and sensibilities — a thematic concern that works 
well with the lengthy, digressive form Zadie Smith’s 
novels tend to take. 
Anyone familiar with her wonderful and 
often more tightly constructed essays (collected 
in “Changing My Mind” and “Feel Free”) knows 
that Smith is capable of another style, which is less 
omniscient and more everywhere-at-once. Her 
reviews and criticism have a playful, airy exuberance 
that feels like the counterpart 
to the narrative drive of her 
novels, while retaining her 
characteristic 
stylishness. 
Every 
name-drop 
lands 
exactly in the right place, 
every turn of phrase is both 
utterly correct and wryly 
illuminating. She has a way 
of gradually sketching out 
the field, detail by detail, and 
then effecting a resolution or 
a twist at the exact point when 
it is needed. Other times, one 
reaches the end of an essay 
frictionlessly only to realize 
that they’ve ended up in a 
completely different place than 
they started. 
I mention her essays because 
it’s worth keeping them in mind 
when reading Smith’s first 
collection of short stories, “Grand Union.” The stories 
sometime seem like they’re outgrowths of the more 
experimental essays in “Feel Free” — they are airy, 
exuberant constructions unmoored from the essay’s 
fidelity to literal reality. Absent the usual structures 
she works with, Smith is free to try new approaches, 
to experiment with pastiche, to sketch with a soft, 
loose pencil. The result is as uneven as it is thrilling 
— it feels like documentation of experimentation 
rather than a polished, tightly-woven collection of 
the kind that writers like Jhumpa Lahiri or Deborah 
Eisenberg create. In other words, this book has 
much the same roundabout, baggy energy of her 
novels. The essay form 
also seems like something 
of a touchpoint for some 
of the stories here, in that 
Smith frequently eschews 
conflict, plot and even 
character 
development 
in favor of scene, texture 
and voice. Her game is 
not to tell a story but to 
describe a situation via the 
accumulation of details, and, in the process, to tease 
out tensions and contradictions. 
One story that works like this is the fourth in the 
collection, “Words And Music.” The story begins 
with a moving portrait of two sisters separated by 
the circumstances of their lives, as one returns to 
other’s Manhattan townhouse after she has died, 
having inherited it from her. “She sits in Candice’s 
accidental gold mine and rips up the little postcards 
as they arrive, a few each week, the ones that explain 
how much the house is worth and how easy it would 
be to sell. She doesn’t doubt it.” This thread only lasts 
a couple pages, though — the second half of the story 
pivots to an unnamed first-person narrator who goes 
on to describe a disabled man who has become “a 
piece of city choreography,” a man who walks around 
dressed as Abraham Lincoln, a “cipher” under 
the Washington Square arch that she describes as 
“inauthentic, like me.” 

This little quip is never explained, but it’s clear what 
it means. Many of the narrators in Smith’s stories 
work like apparitions of the third-person omniscient 
voice, and it helps that many of them live lives similar 
to Smith’s. Many of the narrators of the Manhattan 
stories are middle-aged creative professionals, often 
biracial, entertaining variously conflicted feelings 
about personal identity. Another story that resembles 
a personal essay, “Downtown,” documents a visit 
from two Jamaican aunts during the Kavanaugh 
hearings, which are only one element of the narrator’s 
elusive “funk.” She goes to a Black church and prays 
for a long list of Black people killed by police in 
recent years. The narrator feels weird about this — 
“You don’t say to a witch: The reason they’re dunking 
you is because you’re a witch. You say: The reason 
they’re dunking you is these motherfuckers believe 
in witchcraft!” This tiny semantic point is not taken 
well by the other churchgoers. Elsewhere in the 
story, the narrator meets a 
taciturn 
Austrian 
painter 
who lives in a Hungarian 
forest and represents a kind of 
absurd pole of purity that she 
simultaneously 
desires 
and 
feels guilty for desiring. The 
story doesn’t try to connect 
these disparate incidents. In 
many cases their meaning is 
self-evident, it’s more that their 
juxtaposition creates elusive 
flashes of meaning. This is a 
kind of fiction that is less about 
situations as it is about affects 
— the lack of plot development 
hardly makes the stories less 
rich, in the same way that deep 
water is never still no matter 
what the wind is doing. 
The 
more 
character-
driven stories tend toward 
portraiture, which is sometimes wonderful, as in the 
first section of “Words And Music,” and sometimes 
tiresome, as in the maudlin “Big Week,” a portrait of 
a Boston ex-cop, a fount of guilt and wishful thinking, 
who is trying to reconnect with this family after 
recovering from a problem with opiates. Other stories 
in the collection show Smith engaging, with mixed 
success, with science fiction, parable, folk tale, 
metafiction. Most of these stories experiment with 
fragmentation or disjunction to varying degrees. 
Smith’s style has gotten more terse with each book 
she has written, and in “Grand Union” her prose is 
honed down to a fine edge. Even the few stories that 
confer more traditional 
narrative pleasures, like 
“Sentimental Education,” 
often open with bursts of 
disjunct energy:
“Back 
then, 
she 
unnerved 
men. 
But 
couldn’t 
understand 
why, and sought answers 
from 
unreliable 
sources. 
Women’s 
magazines 
— 
women themselves. Later, in midlife, she came to 
other conclusions. Lay on the grassy pavilion above 
the Serpentine café, admiring a toddler, her own son, 
as he waded in and out of the wading pool. Suddenly 
her daughter appeared at her shoulder: ‘You look at 
him like you’re in love with him. Like you want to paint 
him.’”
In a paragraph like this, the length of the 
sentences is almost as important as what is being 
conveyed. The prose has a blocky, forceful character 
that undercuts the literal things that happen within 
it. Smith’s prose is like a flashlight that shines on 
her subject — revealing only what is immediately 
relevant or salient in what feels like a much deeper 
structure. It’s this — Smith’s consistent, masterly 
wryness, her control over every detail — that 
makes this story collection such a joy to read. Even 
though there are occasional misfires in the book, it’s 
wonderful to follow her wherever she might go.

Smith’s story debut glows

“Let It Snow,” the latest John Green novel-
to-film adaptation (originally a collaboration 
with authors Lauren Myracle and Maureen 
Johnson), is great in the way that cold pizza 
is great. It may not look good, taste good or go 
down very well, but the idea of it is casually 
spectacular. “Snow” leans so clumsily into 
its own clichés that the result is a charming 
holiday romance-fest that hides nothing about 
its eventual destination, but still manages to 
savor the journey along the beaten path.
Like the original source material, “Snow” 
is a euphoric display of adolescent hormones, 
an emulation and a caricature of teen years 
that 
resonates 
not 
despite 
its 
exaggeration, 
but 
because 
of 
it. 
When 
a 
particularly 
robust snowstorm 
hits 
a 
small, 
unnamed 
suburban 
town, 
the 
lives 
of 
several 
high 
schoolers become 
entangled 
with 
awkward 
sexual 
tension. 
The 
writers 
hold nothing back, 
offering characters that fit precisely into every 
trope a viewer can imagine. Among a tapestry 
of main players, there’s Tobin (Mitchell Hope, 
“Descendants”), a shy dork who has been on 
the verge of admitting his love for his best 
friend for his entire life; Addie, (Odeya Rush, 
“Lady Bird”), a committed friend paranoid 
her boyfriend is cheating on her; Keon, (Jacob 
Batalon, “Spider-Man: Far From Home”), an 
aspiring DJ who will do anything to throw one 
great party for his friends; Stuart, (Shameik 
Moore, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse”), a 
popstar on tour who might just be ready to find 
love; and (most quizzically) Oscar-nominated 

Joan Cusack (“Toy Story 4”) as an unnamed, 
tin-foil-donning snow plower.
Once these pieces of the story are set, it’s 
hard not to enjoy the way they unfold, cross 
paths and explode against each other. In that 
way, “Snow” is like a rollercoaster whose entire 
trajectory is visible, but that doesn’t mute its 
angsty and harmless thrills. Conversations 
are stilted emotional gushes, often ending in 
sweeping declarations or stinging rebukes. As 
the blizzard picks up, emotions only run hotter. 
Friendships fracture and plans collapse. But 
the piercing, irresistible power of “Snow” is a 
viewer’s knowledge that everything will work 
itself out in the end. 
“Snow” is the kind of movie that elicits 
laughter more frequently at its schlock than at 
the jokes in its dialogue. But laughter is laughter, 
and 
intentions 
aside, 
the 
film 
was substantially 
humorous. 
Needless 
to 
say, “Snow” will 
not 
change 
the 
course of modern 
cinema. But then 
again, who cares? 
What 
the 
film 
achieves is pure 
and concentrated 
joy, a lazy removal 
from 
life’s 
problems. 
The 
characters 
deal 
with issues that 
are, for the vast majority, miniscule versions 
of actual obstacles, and to see them persevere 
is a simple and careless kind of pleasure. It is 
an experience that calls for some hot cocoa, 
a snowflake-patterned blanket, a couch that 
sinks down further than it should and curtains 
that block all afternoon sunlight from the 
windows.
Above all, “Snow” is a warm welcome to the 
holiday season. With a recent blanket of snow 
spread upon Ann Arbor’s streets and nose-
diving temperatures that won’t recover until 
late spring, it might be exactly what you need 
now.

‘Snow’ is a wonderfully
timely guilty pleasure

FILM REVIEW
TV REVIEW

Without a single member of the original “High 
School Musical” trilogy, Disney waved its magic 
wand once again to give us a program we never 
knew we wanted. If you get past the layered 
and convoluted title as well as the promotional 
hashtag; #HSMTMTS, you will most certainly 
enjoy the program that was absolutely made to 
lure my generation to Disney’s new streaming 
platform, Disney+. Let me lay this out for you, 
because the concept is really not that confusing 
once it is explained, but you may need to re-read 
the sentence a few times before it clicks. “High 
School Musical: The Musical: The Series” is 
about what would happen to the lives of teens 
currently attending the real East High, where 
Disney Channel’s “High School Musical” movies 
were filmed, if they were to put on a production 
of the movie “High School Musical” as a musical. 
Got it?
I am reluctant to judge programs by their pilot 
episode because 
what 
happens 
in 
that 
first 
episode is so 
different 
than 
what a show 
may 
actually 
be 
about 
— 
pilots primarily 
function as an 
establishing 
episode, where 
you get a taste 
of each of the 
characters. 
The plot of this 
episode creates 
the 
storylines 
that will drive 
the rest of the season. It is not until the audience 
sees how the plots established in this episode are 
carried out over the remaining episodes of the 
season that they can reach a verdict on whether 
or not “High School Musical: The Musical: The 
Series” is worth trying to understand. 
This show is set in the real world in which 
“High School Musical” remains a cultural 
phenomenon of successful television movies 
starring Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens, where 

real kids are putting on a stage production of those 
real movies. Comically, these fictional students 
happen to fictionally go to the real school used as 
the set, which has everyone talking about “High 
School Musical” on the set of “High School 
Musical.” When I put it like that, it sounds like 
a recipe for another disastrously-made program 
in an age in which good television is increasingly 
hard to find, despite more television than ever 
before being produced. This is far from the case. 
The pilot extremely self-aware and comic. The 
tone, which is established by the ridiculousness 
of the title, drives home the point of the series 
and why it works — moments range from silly, 
sarcastic and serious in the same way when you 
are a teenager that everything feels like life or 
death. 
The show stars a group of exceptionally 
talented teenagers, most of whom I have 
never heard of, and might be more talented 
than the original cast. Nini (Olivia Rodrigo, 
“Bizaardvark”) and Gina (Sofia Wylie, “Andi 
Mack”) are just two of the standout performances 
from Disney alums. Could this be their 
breakout 
role, 
introducing 
them 
to 
an 
older television 
audience? 
Also, Seb (Joe 
Serafini) 
is 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan alum. 
So, go blue.
The 
show 
simultaneously 
pokes 
fun 
at 
the 
absurdity 
of high school, 
theater people, 
Disney 
and 
show business. 
You name it, the 
show has it. The parallels to the original plot of 
“High School Musical” are prevalent, which 
kind of makes this “High School Musical,” but 
reimagined through the lens of “The Office.” 
And as crazy as it sounds, somehow … it works. 
There is no other program with multiple colons

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

André Aciman’s book tour for “Find Me” was hosted by 
Literati bookstore in Rackham Auditorium this past Saturday 
and featured a conversation with Zahir Janmohamed, M.F.A. 
creative writer in the Helen Zell program. I approached the 
event with great admiration for Aciman, being that I am 
particularly fond of “Call Me By Your Name,” his 2007 novel 
which was made into a film with Timothée Chalamet in 2017. 
The novel follows 17-year old American Italian-Jewish boy 
named Elio who falls in love with a visiting scholar, a 24-year 
old American Jewish man named Oliver, in 1980s Italy. 
The 
piece 
showcases 
a 
thoughtful 
commitment 
to 
relationships under the circumstances of Elio and Oliver, while 
bridging love and naiveté through their coquettish desires for 
each other and eventually wonders about loss and connection. 
But the sequel surprises us. We’d assume it would center on 
the immediate aftermath of the fiery passion between Elio and 
Oliver, but instead Aciman takes a more unique route. 
“At first I was writing about Elio,” Aciman said when asked 
about the new book. “I was writing an Elio that was 18, 19, 20 
but then I thought, ‘Okay Elio misses Oliver … Oliver misses 
Elio, that’s all. It ends there.’ I knew that I had to go somewhere 
else. I needed a conflict.” 
Some time later, Aciman was writing a story about a man 
on a train going to Rome. At first he wasn’t sure what he was 
writing about, but then he realized he was writing about a 
father going to visit his son — his son being a now older Elio. 
Janmohamed steered the conversation well, shedding light 
onto not just “Call Me by Your Name,” but some of Aciman’s 
other major works as well. Despite the author’s blunt yet 
romantic caveats and tangents, Janmohamed asked poignant, 
astute questions that led to some really interesting takeaways. 
When asked about his many essay collections and nonfiction 
pieces, which center around his family being exiled from 
Egypt in the ’60s, Aciman said, “You write about a thing to 
understand it. We work around painful moments and look for 
the undisclosed humor to survive. That’s the gift of writing, it’s 
like going into an old attic to find things there that you haven’t 

paid much attention to.” Aciman takes a mature, seasoned 
approach to his writing. Throughout the talk, it became clear 
that he follows his own impulse over commonly recited wisdom 
about writing. 
“I don’t use the word ‘love’ at all in my writing. It does not 
appear once in ‘Call Me by Your Name,’” he said, when asked 
about the role romance plays in his work. “I don’t write ‘I love 
you’ because if you use that word ‘love’ in writing, you close the 
door to everything else. You want to express the inflections of 
desire and wanting. If you mention the word ‘love,’ you don’t 
have the courage to examine all the tension that comes with 
it.” 
In “Call Me by Your Name,” homoerotic love and the fumbles 
of falling for someone are explored, and Jewish identity plays 
a subtle role, bridging an initial connection between the two 
men. 
“It’s the first thing they have in common. Being Jewish. 
Even if nothing were to happen, they have something binding 
them. They cannot undo it, they can only build upon it.” 
Despite not being extremely religious himself, Aciman 
writes about his Jewish identity often in his writing. In “Call 
Me by Your Name,” he specifically states he uses Judaism as 
a metaphor for Elio and Oliver’s larger feelings toward one 
another. Other than that integral part of their identity, both 
men are not overtly described in the novel. 
“I give you three sensations in the book. The smell of 
rosemary, the sound of the knives being sharpened on 
Wednesdays, and when everyone naps, the coffee being made. 
I do not care for physical description in my writing because it 
does not interest me. I don’t want to know what the people or 
places look like, I want to know what goes on in the heads of 
two human beings who are sitting, drinking coffee, trying to 
find out if there’s anything between them,” 
His new book is no exception. Its commitment to the internal 
emotions which drive the characters’s impulses and actions is 
flowery and articulate. 
“Writing is about doing better than what real life has given 
you. What writers do, is that we put our work between us and 
life. And reality. It’s a filter, and that filter is how some of us 
survive,” Aciman said before reading some passages from his 
new novel.

Quick turnaround helps shake dust

Both of the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s matchups this 
past weekend felt closer than 
its 20-point margins of victory 
would suggest.
On Friday, the Wolverines 
demonstrated an inability to 
hold onto the ball, tallying 19 
turnovers and 22 fouls.
“Hailey Brown got in foul 
trouble 
early, 
(Akienreh 
Johnson) got in foul trouble 
early, (Naz Hillmon) got in foul 
trouble,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “We’ve got 
to work on staying out of foul 
trouble, and we’ve got to work 
on being able to adjust to the 
officiating.”
It was an ugly game defined 
by mistakes, but after a day’s 
worth of rest and the experience 
of 40 minutes of basketball, 
Michigan managed to gain a 
grip on its mistakes. Against 
Bradley, it was cleaner — despite 
still committing 12 turnovers, it 
limited itself to 13 fouls.
Unlike Friday, there wasn’t 
a series of five plays in which 
four ended with turnovers, and 

a player fouling out on Sunday. 
There 
wasn’t 
five 
straight 
possessions 
that 
ended 
in 
turnovers either. 
Instead, there was precise 
ball movement. At one moment, 
Hillmon was able to gather a 
rifled pass from Brown, before 
quickly recognizing a triple team 
and, in the blink 
of an eye, finding 
a 
wide 
open 
senior 
guard 
Kayla Robbins for 
a layup.
The precision 
picked 
up 
in 
the second half 
Sunday with only 
four 
turnovers 
against 
nine 
assists 
as 
the 
stakes grew higher and the 
Wolverines faced adversity from 
a comeback push by Bradley.
“The third quarter, they were 
able to knock down some threes, 
but I thought the start of the 
fourth quarter we regrouped 
and finished the game strong,” 
Barnes Arico said. “(We) did a 
better job of taking care of the 
basketball in the second half, 
which was great to see.”
Another 
big 
part 
of 

Michigan’s growth from Friday 
to Sunday was Hillmon — its star 
player — making herself a force. 
She was stifled Friday, fighting 
against double teams and trying 
to come into her new role as the 
focal point of the offense. None 
of those troubles presented 
themselves Sunday on her way to 
a double-double 
as she racked 
up 12 rebounds 
with 10 second-
chance points.
“Last 
game 
I 
was 
really 
lacking in that 
category,” 
Hillmon 
said. 
“I 
just 
really 
wanted to go 
out and just say 
that every rebound was mine, 
and really just try to hustle and 
get to the boards, like offensively 
and defensively, but really just 
trying to work in and hustle 
every play.”
Perhaps it was simply first 
game jitters, or an adjustment 
back 
into 
the 
harshness 
of 
college 
basketball, 
but 
Michigan’s growth in just one 
day showed what it was capable 
of.

Michigan tops Michigan State, 2-1 
in Big Ten Tournament first round

With 
the 
game 
tied 
up 
and 20 minutes remaining in 
regulation, 
senior 
forward 
Jack Hallahan took a free kick 
from the right-side that sailed 
through the box untouched. The 
Michigan faithful released an 
anguished sigh of frustration.
Missed scoring opportunities 
were mounting, and it appeared 
this was another miss for the 
Wolverines. 
Just a split second later, 
though, vexation transformed 
into 
euphoria. 
Hallahan’s 
curling ball took a fortuitous 
bounce high off the turf, flying 
into the top left corner of the 
goal and giving the Michigan 
men’s soccer team the lead. 
Hallahan 
lept 
emphatically 
into the air and pumped his 
fist, the stadium buzzing at the 
sight of his heroics. His goal 
proved to be the difference, as 
the Wolverines (10-4-4 overall, 
4-1-3 Big Ten) held on to defeat 
rival Michigan State (3-12-3, 
3-3-1) 2-1 in the first round of the 
Big Ten Tournament on Sunday. 
“When we got the draw, 
we knew it was going to be 
difficult,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “In a game like 
this, with the rivalry, records 
are thrown out the window. 
From that standpoint, to get 
over the hump and find a way 
to win the game in come-from-
behind fashion is really good.”
First half struggles painted 
an all-too familiar picture for 
the Wolverines. Despite holding 
an advantage in shots and time 
of possession, Michigan entered 
the locker room trailing at the 
half, 1-0, thanks to a goal by 
Spartan forward Gianni Ferri. 
“The mentality, at that point, 
is to still keep playing,” Daley 
said. “We want to be positive as 
a group. When we came here, 
you had to score to win the game 
in the end. So, if you’re down 
one goal, that doesn’t change the 
mentality.”
Sophomore forward Derick 
Broche sparked the Wolverines 

in the second half. Coming off 
the bench, Broche consistently 
pushed up the left flank, setting 
a more aggressive tone. In the 
60th minute, Broche broke the 
scoring spell — a shot by junior 
forward Umar Farouk Osman 
brushed off junior defenseman 
Jackson Ragen in the center 
of the box, trickling past the 
last line of Spartan defense. 
All alone, Broche buried the 
ball into the bottom left corner, 
energizing the team and tying 
the game.
“When it came to me, I was 
like ‘just shoot 
it,’ ” Broche said. 
“It was on my 
strong foot, and 
luckily I was able 
to put it in. I had 
one five minutes 
earlier 
that 
I 
didn’t, and I was 
like, ‘can’t miss 
this one.’ ”
Throughout 
the 
second 
half, Michigan proved more 
relentless on attack, challenging 
the Michigan State defense with 
fastbreaks and strong crosses, 
which resulted in an increase 
in shots. The team grew to 
embrace the match’s physicality 
— each team committed double-
digit foul totals — showcasing 
a tangible sense of hunger and 
aggression. 
On the other end, after 
allowing the early goal, the 
Wolverine defense shaped into 
form as a wall between the 

ball and freshman goalkeeper 
Owen Finnerty. The Spartans 
were kept in check offensively, 
mustering only one shot on 
goal in the second half. Even 
when junior defenseman Austin 
Swiech left the match due to 
injury, the defense persisted, 
as junior forward Mohammed 
Zakyi filled in seamlessly at left 
back until Swiech could return. 
“The guys tightened it up 
after the goal, making sure they 
fought,” Daley said. “And these 
guys have been doing it all year, 
fighting like crazy all along and 
you really can’t 
say 
enough 
about 
them. 
They’ve grinded 
for us.”
With 
the 
win, 
Michigan 
extended 
its 
season, 
advancing 
to 
play 
Penn 
State 
in 
the 
tournament 
semifinals 
on 
Friday. 
The 
victory was also paramount 
for the team’s hopes of earning 
a bid in the upcoming NCAA 
tournament. 
“We can use our whole 
season, especially this game, as 
a springboard,” Hallahan said. 
“We’ve been doing well, beat 
our rivals again — twice in a 
row — and came from behind. 
We know that we can grit it out 
if we’re ever down in a game and 
come back and win the game. 
It’s a huge step for the team.”

The Michigan men’s soccer team beat Michigan State, 2-1, on Sunday.

If you’re down 
one goal, that 
doesn’t change 
the mentality.

‘It’s gonna start coming’: How Michigan is addressing power play woes

Sitting in a waiting area outside 
of his office, Mel Pearson’s mind 
wandered to Mo Farah.
Farah is a distance runner who 
represented Great Britain in the 
2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, 
running the 10,000 meters.
He came in the favorite and 
came out winning gold — his 
fourth.
The track event, the distance 
runner and his accolades have little 
to do with the Michigan hockey 
team, yet when Pearson brought 
up the athlete while discussing the 
team’s offensive struggles, there 
was no confusion on why.
The Wolverines are no favorites, 
nor has this group of players won it 
all even once — let alone multiple 
times. But it was the events within 
the race that drew the comparison 
from Pearson.
Farah 
had 
fallen 
midway 
through the run after getting 
clipped on the back of his heel by 
another runner during the 10th 
lap. It wasn’t intentional, nor was 
it Farah’s fault. But as a result, the 
British runner fell, costing him his 
pace and place. 
“He could have just laid there,” 
Pearson said. “Already had his 
gold, was knocked down, but he 
got up and ended up winning.
“Once you get knocked down 
and sometimes it seems like it’s 
hard to get back up, but that’s all 
we have to do.”
It was the type of tenacity 
Pearson has seen in the Michigan 
players 
during 
their 
current 
power-play slump.
Against 
Minnesota, 
the 
Wolverines 
went 
0-for-9 
on 
power plays, reflecting the pains 
of their overall lack of offensive 
production 
for 
the 
weekend. 
Four of the man-advantages went 
without a single shot on goal for 
Michigan. The team just couldn’t 
find a breakthrough on offensive 
special teams.
And it derives from a multitude 

of reasons. There was no single 
answer, as Pearson liked to put it, 
or else he would have it fixed. But 
something that stuck out to him 
was the unnatural way the puck 
moved — “choreographed,” in his 
words.
Having 
things 
forced goes hand-
in-hand with the 
mentality of players 
as the goals refuse 
to drop. There’s 
a hill to climb for 
players, 
forwards 
in particular, when 
their role is to score 
goals, 
and 
they 
can’t. So, to combat 
the mental stain the scoring 
drought has, the team practices 
with more figurative weight on 
their sticks so that when gametime 

comes, those weights are removed, 
and feel a little more natural.
“I just say a little bit more of a 
sense of urgency to do the little 
things right in practice,” said 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Nick 
Blankenburg. 
“So 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
game, we’re not 
gripping 
our 
sticks too tight 
or then we can 
just go out there 
and 
have 
the 
confidence 
to 
make the right 
place 
and 
not 
be nervous or 
anything.
“I 
think 
we’ve 
just 
been 
preaching, ‘Yeah, you know, to talk 
going our way can’t feel bad for 

ourselves.’ ” 
It’s easy to get crestfallen when 
the losses start piling up, and the 
goals don’t. But the team mentality 
on the crux of the struggle is the 
same. Play through it, because the 
process is exactly 
what it’s supposed 
to be.
“But I think 
soon it’s gonna 
start 
coming,” 
Blankenburg 
said. “The offense 
and we just gotta 
stick to good team 
defense and the 
rest will come.”
Pearson 
had 
seen it before, even in his most 
successful year as Michigan’s 
coach. Coming in with seniors 
Cooper 
Marody 
and 
Tony 

Calderone on the power play, it 
wasn’t hard to see why that unit 
brought so much success. But even 
that dominant line had its times of 
trouble, as Pearson likes to remind 
the team. No matter how good you 
are, adversity is 
going to hit even 
the best of players.
“And 
even 
at 
times 
when 
you’re rolling and 
know you have a 
good power play 
it 
struggles 
at 
times,” 
Pearson 
said. “I think my 
first year, Cooper 
and 
Tony 
and 
those guys are really good. But we 
went through, you know, moments 
where we weren’t very good, and 
we just couldn’t get anything 

going.”

Added 
Blankenburg: 

“Sometimes the pucks just aren’t 
going in and that’s on the power 
play, even strength. I think it just 
happens. And that’s part of the 
adversity that we’re going to face 
(as) the year goes on.”
And it’s more than just not 
scoring goals. 
Part of adversity is the doubt — 
the fear that the gameplans, the 
strategies, the systems just aren’t 
working. But as Michigan falls 
deeper in the hole, it’s the belief 
in the process that keeps them 
running on through.
“There’s a ton of example, you 
know, adversity,” Pearson said. “I 
mean, if you call this real adversity 
by not scoring any goals? We’ll be 
fine.”

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
Sophomore defenseman Nick Blankenburg said that Michigan’s struggles on the power play are just part of the adversity the team will face throughout the season.

“

Throw out the records,” 
said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh early Monday 
afternoon, a wry smile subtly 
forming on his face. “There’s a 
cliché you can use when you play 
this type of 
game.”
Whether 
he believes 
that or not 
— his team 
staring down 
the barrel of 
a bout against 
4-5 Michi-
gan State on 
Saturday — 
matters little. 
This is a week that annually 
breeds the kind of teeth-gritting 
clichés of coachspeak, muttered 
monotonously and meaning-
lessly. Respect for the opponent. 
The importance of rivalry games. 
All business.
Those clichés will evaporate 
the moment the ball is snapped 
and will be ripped to shreds after 
a victor is crowned mid-after-
noon Saturday. 
Then everyone 
will gather again 
one year from 
now to rehearse 
this charade 
once more.
The reality is 
you can’t throw 
out the records. 
You can’t ignore 
the nosedive the 
Spartans have 
taken, nor the ramifications of 
what a beatdown on Saturday 
might mean. This is not 2015, 
two ranked opponents duking 
it out in Harbaugh’s first year, 
surely an even-handed promise 
of things to come. It’s not 2016, 
one side rampaging toward real 
postseason hopes, the other just 
praying to play spoiler. It’s not 
2017, two hapless sides assigning 
meaning to a game that other-
wise would have none. And it’s 
not 2018, two ranked opponents 
playing an ostensible elimination 
game.
You can’t throw out the 
records here because the records 
tell all. This is one side trying 
to cling to a fading sense of who 
it once was, the other looking 

to send that crisis into turbo. 
This is Jim Harbaugh trying 
to deliver a knockout punch to 
his most formidable foe. This is 
Michigan trying to bludgeon a 
Michigan State program slowly 
sinking in quicksand. The onus is 
on the Wolverines to grab hold of 
the reins.
Underneath those annual 
platitudes Monday, the hints 
of that mentality were readily 
apparent.
“You can’t let them get their 
heads up,” said junior corner-
back Ambry Thomas. “Try to 
step on their throat and stay 
there all game. You know that 
they’re going to treat this game 
like their Super Bowl.”
Then asked what he sees of 
the Spartans’ offense, a group 
that ranks 96th of 130 teams in 
total offense, Thomas said: “I see 
a team with a lot of talent, hon-
estly. They just haven’t figured it 
out yet.”
Harbaugh’s hesitancy this 
week is understandable, though. 
His counterpart, Mark Danto-
nio, has beaten 
Michigan eight 
of his 12 years at 
Michigan State, 
including two 
wins in four 
tries against 
Harbaugh. Even 
with a talent gap, 
the Spartans 
have found ways 
to muck these 
games up, slow 
them down and even win them. 
In 2017, Dantonio’s crew ran the 
ball 40 times, picked off Michi-
gan quarterback John O’Korn 
three times and held on for a 
14-10 win in the pouring rain. It 
was a master class in coaching, 
beginning to end.
That’s what guides Har-
baugh’s trepidation heading into 
a game in which all signs point 
toward a blowout.
“On high alert for every-
thing,” Harbaugh said. “Specifi-
cally, we understand that Coach 
Dantonio is a master motivator. 
There could be trick plays on 
special teams. Punt fakes, field 
goal fakes. Everything needs 
to be alerted and prepared and 
ready for.”

Still, what exists amidst Har-
baugh’s suppressed fears cannot 
simply eliminate what’s right 
there in plain sight. Dantonio 
and Michigan State are 15-18 in 
Big Ten play over the past three-
plus years. They are fresh off 
blowing a 28-3 lead at home to 
a mediocre Illinois team. There 
are questions swirling about the 
future of the greatest coach in 
that program’s modern history. 
Those questions are real, and 
perhaps lasting.
“Whatever’s happened to 
them, has happened,” said 
sophomore defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson. “Regardless of what 
happened to them, we’re going 
to go out there and play our 
game.”
Play our game. Throw out the 
records. High alert. This week, 
the typical clichés are out there 
to grab onto if you so choose. But 
they do a disservice to the abnor-
mal stakes at play this weekend.
How about instead of throw-
ing out the records, we throw out 
the pretense: If Michigan does 
what it should do on Saturday, it 
will shatter the balance of power 
in this rivalry for the foreseeable 
future.

at maxmarco@umich.edu or on 

Twitter @Max_Marcovitch.

Aidan Hutchinson knows what 
this rivalry is all about. He grew 
up in Dearborn, less than 100 miles 
from both schools. He heard stories 
about it from his dad, a standout 
linebacker at Michigan in the 
early 1990s. In high school, he was 
recruited by both sides.
Monday afternoon, standing 
in front of a rivalry-sized swarm 
of cameras inside Schembechler 
Hall, that experience is what led 
him to declare Michigan State “our 
biggest rival,” before realizing what 
he said and pausing. “Or, maybe our 
biggest rival.”
It’s a declaration that would 
seem ridiculous in 49 states, with 
Ohio State looming in two weeks. 
But not here, where this rivalry 
— and your side of it — defines 
friendships and shapes childhoods.
That’s 
the 
reality 
that’s 
encompassed Hutchinson’s life for 
the past 19 years. And now, four 
days from the Spartans’ biannual 
trip to Michigan Stadium, it’s the 

reality that stares him in the face.
Because for all his experience on 
periphery of this rivalry, Saturday 
is Hutchinson’s first time truly 
on the inside, as a key cog in the 
Wolverines’ defense.
“It’s completely different (to play 
in it),” Hutchinson said. “I think it 
intensifies the rivalry even more. 
You watch it, you kind of get the 
feel of the rivalry. But when you’re 
actually in it — you’re hitting them, 
you’re talking a little bit — that’s 
when things kind of intensify.”
The preparation, in a football 
sense, isn’t any different. Film 
study 
started 
the 
day 
after 
Michigan’s last game, much like 
it will for Indiana next week. 
More experienced players haven’t 
been inundating underclassmen 
with words of advice. When the 
Wolverines take the field, there 
won’t be any special ceremonies or 
alterations to the routine.
But the difference is tangible.
“It’s about who’s the big brother 
and who’s the little sister in this 
state,” said junior cornerback 
Ambry Thomas, providing the 

day’s requisite viral rivalry quote. 
“That’s what it’s really about.”
For Hutchinson, the difference 
is more understated, coming from 
his ingrained knowledge of what 
this game means.
It’s also more personal, coming 
from his friendship with Theo 
Day, a reserve quarterback for the 
Spartans.
“The talking has definitely 
started between me and him,” 
Hutchinson said. “… I don’t know 
if I can tell you what he said, but 
some words were said between 
us. He was talking a little bit about 
the game. I’m just pumped to play 
him.”
It’s a familiar refrain for anyone 
who listens to these rivalry week 
pump-up speeches masquerading 
as press conferences.
Every year, in-state players 
position themselves in front of 
cameras and talk about their 
relationships on the other side, 
often with brash declarations 
included. And then, every year, 
the in-game jawing follows suit, 
crescendoing in the most physical, 
personal game of the Wolverines’ 
season.
“Obviously there’s going to 
be a little bit more stuff after the 
whistle,” Hutchinson said. “I’m 
expecting that because of how this 
rivalry has been in the past.”
For players like Ben Bredeson or 
Carlo Kemp, that part is normal by 
now. They’re the ones who know 
better than to provide any bulletin-
board material, instead emitting 
a respect for the opponent that 
won’t land them any cheap shots 
Saturday afternoon.
Hutchinson might be expecting 
it, having gotten a few snaps last 
year. But for now, all he can do is 
wait.
That, and get ready for the self-
described most important game 
he’s ever started.
“Last year, I came in as a backup, 
only got a couple plays,” Hutchinson 
said. “But I’m expecting to do some 
big things in the game.”

‘M’ tries to weaponize two-big looks

If you can’t think of a 
time when Jon Teske played 
alongside another big man last 
season, it’s for good reason.
For the Michigan basketball 
team, those instances were 
few and far between. Now-
departed 
forwards 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
and 
Charles 
Matthews played significant 
minutes on last year’s team, 
and 
then-sophomore 
wing 
Isaiah Livers also saw time off 
the bench. That, coupled with 
the fact that the Wolverines’ 
didn’t have a true backup ‘5,’ 
prevented 
then-freshmen 
Brandon Johns Jr. and Colin 
Castleton from making a major 
impact.
That’s no longer the case.
After 
Brazdeikis 
and 
Matthews left for the NBA 
Draft, Livers assumed a role 
as a starter. Now sophomores, 
Johns and Castleton spent 
the summer in Ann Arbor, 
where 
they 
gained 
much-
needed muscle ahead of their 
anticipated spikes in playing 
time. Howard envisions both 
players as pieces capable of 
scoring at all three levels, 
holding their own on the 
glass and guarding multiple 
positions.
Against Appalachian State 
last 
Tuesday, 
Johns 
and 
Castleton all looked much-
improved. The duo accounted 
for 13 points on 5-of-9 shooting 
and grabbed five rebounds. 
Perhaps it was the undersized 
opponent or natural maturity 
of being a year older, but it 
shouldn’t come as a surprise to 
see the immediate returns of 
hiring first-year coach Juwan 
Howard, who developed young 
big men like Hassan Whiteside 
and 
Bam 
Adebayo 
as 
an 
assistant with the Miami Heat.
“Everyday, 
(Howard) 
is 
working us out one-on-one, 
all the big guys, and he’s the 
coach that’s getting down and 
dirty with us,” Castleton said 
at Michigan’s media day in 
October. “He’ll push us, bump 
us and stuff like that, and he’ll 
teach us while we do it. … I 

don’t think it’s like (what) any 
other coach can do because 
he’s that position player.”
With 
no 
shortage 
of 
frontcourt talent in the Big 
Ten this season, Howard used 
last Tuesday’s season-opener 
to flex his own team’s muscle. 
After Teske scored 11 points 
in just over four minutes, 
the 
Wolverines 
showcased 
variations of his lineup that 
featured multiple big men.
While Teske may be the 
lone center in the starting 
lineup, two of Michigan’s three 
rotational big men were on the 
floor together for 14 minutes of 
the first half. The Wolverines 
reaped the benefits, outscoring 
the Mountaineers by 10 points 
in that timespan.
“As far as defense-wise, 
we can show the other team 
multiple lineups,” Castleton 
said. “I think it’s great as far as 
versatility and on the offensive 
end it’s good too because we 
have a great high-low game, 
and me and (Teske) can both 
shoot the ball. … We can spread 
the floor out and we’re both 
two really big bodies on the 
glass as well.”
There 
weren’t 
many 
interior challenges against an 
Appalachian State team that 
doesn’t have a player taller 
than 6-foot-9 on its roster, 
while the Wolverines’ three 
rotational big men are at least 
that tall.
Tuesday night, a Creighton 
team with only one healthy 
player taller than 6-foot-8 
visits 
Crisler 
Center. 
That 
player 
is 
6-foot-11 
center 

Kelvin Jones, who is now on 
his fourth college after stints 
at UTEP, Odessa College and 
Idaho State.
From Howard’s perspective, 
though, his team’s interior 
success boils down to more 
than just size.
“It’s 
been 
effective 
for 
us,” Howard said. “Jon is an 
excellent passer, a high-IQ 
player, (he’s) always going 
to make the right play, never 
going to try to do anything he 
cannot do. … Brandon, with his 
activity and energy, he’s been 
ready every time his name has 
been called on. He’s been able 
to produce, and so has Colin.”
Added Castleton: “(Passing) 
is one of the things in (Teske’s) 
game that people don’t really 
talk about. He has so many 
other tools he can show and 
different things on offense 
and defense he does so well 
that overpower the passing 
ability he shows, but passing 
is probably one of his best 
attributes.”
Teske’s 
passing 
could 
become the key to sustaining 
success with multiple big men 
on the floor against formidable 
Big 
Ten 
defenses. 
When 
Michigan 
can’t 
overwhelm 
teams with size alone, high-
low ball movement between big 
men can open opportunities 
that 
otherwise 
wouldn’t 
present themselves.
But to Johns, the appeal is 
simpler.
“It’s like huge towers out 
there,” Johns said. “We’re so 
big, our size disrupts a lot of 
defenses.”
