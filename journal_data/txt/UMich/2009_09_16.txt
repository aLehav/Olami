The Halfway Inn, a favorite hangout among Residential College students located in the basement of East Quad, recently shed its much-beloved food operation and became
simply a lounge (left). The food service moved upstairs where officials say a wider and healthier menu can be available to students.

On the floor of the U.S. House
of Representatives today, legis-
lators will consider a bill that, if
passed, would completely revamp
the American financial aid sys-
tem.
Carved out in Rep. George
Miller's Committee on Education
and Labor, the Student Aid and
Fiscal Responsibility Act (H.R.
3221), would invest $40 billion to
increase Pell Grant scholarships,
strengthen low-interest Perkins
Loans for students most in need
and bolster college access and
completion rates with a $3 million
funding injection, among other
things.
The legislation would overhaul
the lending industry by rout-
ing all new federal student loans
through the government's Direct
Loan program, effectively end-
ing the practice of subsidizing
lenders with taxpayer money. It
would, for all intents and purpos-
es, remove the lending industry
as a middleman between the fed-
eral government doling out finan-
cial aid and the students who are

students adjusting to
lose of the 'Halfass'
By LIBBY ASHTON
For the Daily
The start of this school year
brought more change to East Quad
than just a new freshman class and
some yellow room keys.
The Halfway Inn, which used
to be a cafe, convenience store and
lounge in the basement of the resi-

dence hall, is now only a lounge.
East Quad's new wave of resi-
dents won't share the experience
of waiting for their late-night que-
sadillas to blasting music and the
aroma of "funk" in the East Quad
basement at the establishment af-
fectionately referred to as "the
Half-ass In."
However, according to Michigan
Housing Communications Director
Peter Logan, the quesadillas are the
only missing element.
"The Halfway Inn will continue
to operate as a center for commu-
nity events and programs for all of

East Quad," Logan said, addingthat.
"the only change" would be the re-
location of the food service compo-
nent to the South Dining Room on
the ground floor.
Abbie Stauffer, an LSA senior
working as an East Quad resident
assistant for a second year, said she
was initially disappointed to hear
that the Halfway Inn would be con-
verted to a basic lounge.
"It was a classic East Quad
place," Stauffer said. "It was funky
in the original sense of the word-
smelly, nasty funk.'
Stauffer said she can now ap-

preciae the calmness and conve-
nience of the new area. Also, she
expects the new service to be more
efficient.
"The packaging will be more
consistent now," she said. "(The
students) used to charge you the
same price for different sizes."
Along with its inconsistencies,
Logan explained that the base-
ment location of the food service
was limited in its ability to provide
a variety of options to the custom-
ers. The move upstairs has allowed
for an expanded grill menu and

MYSTERY IN THE DIAG
Several Circle K
ad boards torn up

USPS could close South U. store

In past 10 months,
five signs for group
have been vandalized
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily Staff Reporter
Circle K President Charlie Goelz
doesn't feel his organization is
controversial. Who could possibly
have a problem with community
service?
Yet the volunteer group has been
the target of a string of vandalism
on campus lately.
In the past 10 months, five of
Circle K's Diag boards have been
vandalized, most recently on Sept
1. The previous three incidents
occurred during the summer, and
the first last November.
On July 13 and July 29, respec-
tively, two of the group's Diag
boards were reported stolen by the
Student Organization Resource
Center.
A Diag board was found in some
bushes Aug. 8, and after the Sept
1 incident, the missing board was
found near the Michigan Union.
CircleKnotified the Department
of Public Safety of the thefts after
the July 29 incident.
Goelz, an LSA senior, said the
vandalism frustrates the group
since no other organization has
had their signs torn down as often

as Circle K's.
But the group doesn't know
why.
"SORC told us that it's not abnor-
mal to have one banner ripped
down just because vandalism hap-
pens," he said. "I do know other
organizations that this has hap-
pened to recently. But it is very
abnormal to have it happen to one
group four different times and from
what I know, they were in different
locations, as well."
Afterthefirstvandalismincident
last November, Goelz said Circle K
thought it was an isolated incident.
Since then, he said, the group has
become increasingly puzzled by
the phenomenon.
"We're not a controversial
organization," he said. "We're an
organization that tries to remain
nonpartisan, and we don't cause a
lot of drama."
Many of Circle K's service proj-
ects deal with hunger and environ-
mental issues, but that certainly
doesn't make them unique on cam-
pus, he said.
LSA junior Natalie Kittikul,
Circle K's associate secretary, has
been in charge of organizing the
repainting of the Diag boards and
also found the two that were torn
down.
She said she was trying to keep
an optimistic spin on the whole
situation.

Location is one of
410 stores on the
chopping block
By EMILY ORLEY
Daily StaffReporter
On Oct. 2, a final decision will
be made regarding the closure of
the post office at 1214 S. University
Ave.
The location was one of more
than 700 post offices nation-
wide that were proposed to close
this fall. The list is now down to
approximately 410 stores, and in
two weeks the remaining stores'
fates will be determined.
But Ann Arbor officials and resi-
dents are workingto keep the loca-
tion off the chopping block.
City leaders drafted and sent a
proposal to their representatives
in Washington D.C. last week, ask-
ing them to rally in support of the
location.
U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-Dear-
born) responded urging the Postal
Service to preserve the South Uni-
versity Avenue location.
"Located in the heart of the
University of Michigan's cam-
pus, this post office serves the
needs of thousands of students
who have limited transporta-
tion options," Dingell said in his
statement.

has also expressed discontent.

Feeding our furry friends

Ann Arbor han some of the
friendliest squirrels around. A
fact not at all hindered by the
780 studenta who have joined
a club committed to feeding
them.
The University's Squirrel
Club, founded in 2002 by stu-
dents Jason Colman and Justin
Hyatt, aims to feed and maintain
the community's squirrel popu-
lation, according to the club's
president, Engineering sopho-
more Peter Feng.
"Jason and Justin just brought
im p randomly and were justctalk-
log about squirrels, and thought
it would be cool to have a squir-
rel feeding club," Feng said.'
The club meets each Sunday at
4 p.m. outside the Hatcher Grad-
uate Library, Feng said. During

the meetings, members seek out
and feed hungry squirrels.
Peng explained the "tech-
nique" of feeding squirrels that
the club teaches new members.
"Obtain the peanuts, and then
make a clicking noise with your
mouth. and then wave your arm
up and down that has the peanut
so that the squirrel can see it,"
Feng said. "Then you bend down
so the squirrel can take the pea-
nut from your hand."
Members say they typical-
ly join out of compassion for
Ann Arbor's chubby furry crit-
ters. Though he initially joined
because his friend Feng con-
vinced him to, Engineering
sophomore Jake Askari said he
was taken by the joy of squirrel
feeding from the very first meet-

ing. >"
"It's fuan to do, and it gives"
them food," he said. "And they
like food."
Feng said he thinks the Ann
Arbor squirrels play an integral
role in campus life, and the clubr,
serves as a means of keepinghmaiendgon.
"You don't really find any ,fr +El
friendlier squirrels around," he
said. "And we think it's healthier
for them to eat peanuts than the
garbage they eat."
Those who hope to do more
than feed squirrels will be disap-
pointed, though. When asked if'
the club has any goals aside from"
feeding the squirrels, Feng aid
"No. None at all."'

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Dems query 0bama's
view on immigrant
health care
House Democrats want the
White House to clarify the tougher
view it has taken on illegal immi-
grants and health care reform, say-
ing they can't buy insurance with
their own money from a govern-
ment-created marketplace.
The White House said last week
that President Barack Obama will
oppose allowing illegal immigrants
to buy insurance through the pur-
chasing exchanges, including from
participating private companies.
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said
that is what Obama intended all
along. Also, a system would be cre-
ated to verify people buying from
the exchange are in the country
legally, he said.
"I'm not sure if Gibbs misspoke,"
Rep. Xavier Becerra, vice chairman
of the House Democratic Caucus,
said yesterday.
Asked to clarify Gibbs' com-
ments, White House spokeswoman
Gannett Tseaggai repeated the
White House view that undocu-
mented immigrants would not be
allowed to purchase health care
insurance on the exchange.
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
Great Lakes toxic
cleanups lagging
Cleanup of the most polluted
sites in the Great Lakes is moving
so slowly it will take 77 more years
to finish the job at the existing pace,
according to a federal report.
The U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency still does not know
the full extent of the problem even
though the highly contaminated
spots were identified two decades
ago, said the report by the agency's
inspector general.
"Without improved manage-
ment, coordination and account-
ability, EPA will not succeed in
achieving the results intended"
for the recovery program, said the
report, issued Monday.
Toxic sediment cleanup is among
the goals of a $20 billion Great
Lakes restoration plan developed
by government agencies and non-
profit groups in 2005.
President Barack Obama has
pledged $5 billion toward carry-
ing out the plan and requested $475
million in his 2010 budget. Roughly
one-fourth of that amount would
be devoted to the cleanups.
ATLANTA
Jimmy Carter:
Wilson comments
'based on racism
Former President Jimmy Carter
says Congressman Joe Wilson's out-
burst to President Barack Obama
last week was an act "based on rac-
ism." Carter says Wilson's comment
was part of an "inherent feeling" of
some in this country who feel that a
black man should not be president.
Carter called Wilson's comment
"dastardly" and said the president

should be treated with respect.
The South Carolina Republican
lawmaker was formally rebuked
Tuesday in a House vote divided by
party lines. Wilson shouted "You
lie!" during Obama's speech to Con-
gress last Wednesday.
fCarter was responding to a ques-
tion submitted yesterday night at
a town hall held at his presidential
center in Atlanta.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.
'Person of interest'
identified in killing
of Yale grad student
Police have identified a"personof
interest" in the killing of a Yale Uni-
versity graduate student whose body
was hidden for days in a wall in a
university research building, a Con-
necticut state official said yesterday.
The official has firsthand knowl-
edge of the police investigation into
the death of 24-year-old Annie Le
and would not elaborate on what was
meant by "person of interest." The
official spoke on condition of ano-
nymity because the investigation is
continuing.
A spokesman for New Haven
police, who have been extraordi-
narily tight-lipped during the inves-
tigation, did not immediately return
a call seeking comment.
Police said early yesterday that
they had questioned 150 people in
connection with the death of Le, who
vanished Sept.8 from aYaleresearch

UN probe finds
evidence of war
crimes in Gaza

President Barack Obama addresses the AFL-CIO convention yesterday at the David L Lawrence Convention Center in Pittsburgh.
Obamna tells autoworkers,
unions his policies work

At convention, Obama
rally's support for
health care overhaul
PITTSBURGH (AP) - Shoring
up a key part of his political base,
President Barack Obama turned
to blue-collar crowds yesterday to
rally support for health care over-
haul and claim credit for policies
that have "stopped our economic
free fall."
He found a receptive audience
at the AFL-CIO convention, where
delegates to the nation's largest
labor federation were passing a
resolution calling for changes to
health care that include a govern-
ment-run plan to compete with
private insurance companies.
"Few have fought for this cause
harder, and few have championed
it longer than you, our brothers
and sisters in organized labor,"
Obama told more than a thousand
cheering union members. "You're

making phone calls, knocking on
doors, and showing up at rallies
because you know why this is so
important."
His appearance before the AFL-
CIO - and earlier at a General
Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio
- was part of Obama's aggressive
new effort to sell his health care
overhaul following a speech last
week to a joint session of Con-
gress. He has another health care
rally scheduled for College Park.,
Md., on Thursday and is appear-
ing in six network television inter-
views Sunday and Monday.
Incoming AFL-CIO president
Richard Trumka sought to erase
any doubts that labor would stand
behind Obama, even though the
president has left the door open
to proposals that do not include a
government-run insurance option.
"The president just said he's
going to fight for the public option,"
Trumka told reporters. "We are
going to fight with him to make
sure the public option gets done."

Obama praised organized labor
for creating a middle class and pro-
pelling the economy forward dur-
ing last century. He said labor must
help push the economy ahead now.
"Oneofthefundamentalreasons
I ran for president was to stand up
for working families," Obama said.
"When our middle class succeeds,
that's when the United States of
America succeeds. That's what
we're fighting for."
At the General Motors plant,
Obama claimed credit for an
improving economy. He defended
his administration's intervention
to prevent the collapse of automak-
ers. He also told GM employees that
their company has retooled itselfand
is heading backto a solidbusiness, in
part, because of its work force.
"Your survival and the success
of our economy depended on mak-
ing sure that we got the U.S. auto
industry back on its feet," Obama
said, standing near a production
line where compact Chevrolet
Cobalts are produced.

Officials may seek
prosecution against
both sides of conflict
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
A U.N. investigation concluded
yesterday that both sides in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza
committed war crimes and possible
crimes against humanity, raising
the prospect that officials may seek
prosecution in the International
Criminal Court.
The probe led by former South
African judge Richard Goldstone
concluded that "Israel committed
actions amounting to war crimes,
possibly crimes against humanity,"
during its Dec. 27-Jan. 18 military
operations against Palestinian rock-
et squads in the Gaza Strip.
In a 575-page report, Goldstone
and three other investigators also
found evidence "that Palestin-
ian armed groups committed war
crimes, as well as possibly crimes
against humanity."
Goldstone said the probe, which
included interviews as well as a
review of documents, photos and
30 videos, was completed yesterday
morning, just hours before the hast-
ily called news conference.
"There should be no impunity for
international crimes that are com-
mitted," said Goldstone, a veteran
war crimes investigator who has
served as chief prosecutor for the
U.N. criminal tribunals for the for-
mer Yugoslavia and Rwanda. "It's
very important that justice should
be done."
The report said that Israel's
attacks in the Zeitoun neighborhood
of Gaza City, including the shelling
of a house where soldiers had forced
Palestinian civilians to assemble,

amounted to war crimes.
It found seven incidents in which
civilians were shot while leaving
their homes trying to run for safety,
waving white flags and sometimes
even following Israeli instructions,
as well as the targeting of a mosque
at prayer time, killing 15 people,
were also war crimes.
Investigators found no evidence
the mosque was used to store weap-
ons or for any military activity by Pal-
estinian armed groups, but said they
were unable to look more broadly at
Israel's allegation that the mosques
were used generally by Palestinian
groups for storing weapons.
A "direct and intentional attack"
onthe Al Quds Hospital and anadja-
cent ambulance depot in Gaza City
"may constitute war crimes," the
report said.
Several Palestinians told the mis-
siontheywereused ashumanshields
by the Israeli forces, the report said,
noting the case of Majdi Abd Rabbo,
a 39-year-old intelligence officer of
the Palestinian authority who was
forcedto walk ahead of the troops as
they searched his and his neighbor's
house. Rabbo was forced to undress
down to his underwear in front of
the soldiers and his sons had to strip
naked, the report said.
On the Palestinian side, the
report found that armed groups fir-
ingrockets into southernIsraelfrom
Gaza failed to distinguish between
military targets and the civilian
population.
"Where there is no intended mili-
tary target andthe rockets and mor-
tars are launched into civilian areas,
they constitute a deliberate attack
against the civilian population," the
report said.
"These actions would constitute
war crimes and may amount to
crimes against humanity."

Top military adviser wants more troops in Afghan war

President's top
military adviser says
war is growing more
complicated
WASHI'NGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama's top military
adviser endorsed an increase in
U.S. forces for the worsening war
in Afghanistan yesterday, setting
up a split with leading Democrats
in Congress and complicating an
already-tough decision for the
president himself.
Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the
war is growing more complicated
and the enemy gaining in sophisti-
cation. Winning will require more
resources from outside Afghani-
stan, including more troops, Mul-
len told Congress.
"A properly resourced counter-
insurgency probably means more
forces, and without question, more
time" and dedication, Mullen said.
Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the
U.S. commander in charge of
both American and NATO forces
in Afghanistan, delivered a grim

assessment of the war to Washing-
ton last month and is expected to
follow up soon with a request for
thousands of additional troops and
more equipment.
That will leave Obama to decide
whether to expanda war that polls
say is rapidly losing public support
in the U.S. and drawing pointed
criticism in Congress. He has
already roughly doubled the size
of the American military force in
Afghanistan since taking office,
with only limited gains to show.
Obama has an ambitious strategy
to turn around a war that will soon
enter its ninth year, and his aides
say the plan needs time to work.
Mullen said he does not know
how many additional troops
McChrystal will request, but he
left no doubt that the commander
has concluded that the 21,000
U.S. troops Obama has already
approved are not enough.
Sitting opposite Mullen, the
Democratic chairman of the Sen-
ate Armed Service Committee was
unswayed.
Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan
warned the White House last week
that he does not want to see a request
for more troops until the United

prior to testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on his reappointment.

States takes bolder action to expand
Afghanistan's own armed forces.
"Providing the resources needed
for the Afghan Army and Afghan
police to become self-sufficient
would demonstrate our commit-
mentcto the success of a mission that
is in our national security inter-
est, while avoiding the risks asso-
ciated with a further increase in
U.S. ground combat troops," Levin

declared at yesterday's hearing.
Several other Democrats have
said they want a clearer timeline
and measures of progress from
the administration before approv-
ing large expansions of the troop
commitment or mission. Congress
has approved most of the money
Obama requested for the war so
far, but a large troop increase
would probably require a separate

add-on spending bill.
The head of the House's defense
spending panel, Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa., this week questioned the
logic of adding troops.
"In Vietnam it took 500,000
troops and that didn't solve the
problem," the Vietnam veteran
told the foreign policy blog The
Cable. "We have totake a different
approach."

Key legislative
leaders settle on a
'process' to fix $2.7
billion deficit
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - With
about two weeks left to strike a
state budget deal, two key legisla-
tive leaders said yesterday they had
settled on a "process" to hopefully
break a logjam and address a $2.7
billion deficit, but that sticking
points remained.
Republican Senate Majority
Leader Mike Bishop said he and
Democratic House Speaker Andy
Dillon agreed on how to move for-
ward with budget talks.
But many major issues remained
to be ironed out, including cuts in
college Promise scholarships, state
aid to local governments and the
health care budget. Avoiding those
Senate-passed reductions likely
would require new tax revenue to
be passed by the House - either by
raisingtaxes and fees, reducingtax
breaks orctrying other ways to gen-
erate more money.
"We have an agreement on the
process," said Bishop, of Rochester.
If anything, the budget picture
became murkier.
Dillon, of Redford Townshi,

told reporters he wanted House-
Senate conference committees to
start meeting yesterday or first
thing today. But no hearings were
scheduled, and Dillon did not
appoint members to the panels.
Bishoptold reportersthat House
and Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee members negotiating indi-
vidual budget bills were expected
to shoot for at least $1.2 billion in
Senate-approved cuts as their tar-
get. Yet he added: "We don't know
if those meetings are going to be
fruitful."
Dillon said he was prepared to
pass "very difficult" budget bills.
"But I need some comfort that
I'm going to protect those values
of the Democratic House and the
governor," he said.
House Appropriations Chair-
man George Cushingberry Jr.,
D-Detroit, said the intent was for
the House to pass $1.2 billion in
cuts, but not necessarily the same
reductions the Senate approved
months ago. The House would
pass tax proposals to offset some
cuts, he said.
Bishop said there was no agree-
ment on tax increases.
Talk of cuts to the level pro-
posed by Senate Republicans irked
Senate Democrats, whose votes
would be needed for two-thirds
of the Senate to give the budget

immediate effect so it could start
on time Oct. 1.
If the budget contains cuts to
early childhood education and
other Democratic priorities, "this
caucus will not stand behind that
budget ... regardless of any deal
that is cut in the back room with
the promise of some magical rev-
enue appearing after the budget is
put to bed," said Senate Minority
Leader Mike Prusi, D-Ishpeming.
Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm has proposed cutting
spending by $862 million, raising
$685 million by increasing certain
taxes and trimming tax credits,
and phasing out a business tax sur-
charge. All sides would use a large
chunk of federal stimulus dollars
to help balance the budget.
Dillon, who met with Granholm
Tuesday, said House Democrats
were studying which of her tax
proposals they could support.
Asked if the governor told him
she would veto a budget with only
cuts and not additional tax reve-
nue, Dillon said "she's aware of the
strategy, where we're heading and
she's keeping an open mind."
Granholm spokeswoman Liz
Boyd said the Senate cuts would go
too far.
"We'll have to temper bud-
get cuts with similar cuts in tax
expenditures, she said.

Shifting gears
Wixom energy park will benefit economy and environment
Y ou mayhave never heard ofWixom, Mich., butone day soon,
you might be counting on the city to power your house or
car. Two companies dealing in alternative energy, Xtreme
Power and Clairvoyant Energy, will soon manufacture high effi-
ciency solar panels and energy storage systems at the location of
the former Wixom Ford Plant. This is excellent news for Michigan
as the state struggles to get back on its feet after the decimation of
much of its traditional manufacturing base. New energy projects
are a great way to kick-start the state economy, and the state legis-
lature should continue to push for more of these.

In my view, by apologizing to the president, the most
important person in the history of the world,
that applied to everyone."
- Representative Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) ,commenting on why he has not apologized to other government leaders
for his "You lie!" outburst during President Barack Obama's speech last week, as reported yesterday by CNN.

In 2007, the Wixom Ford Plant closed
after 50years, eliminating about a 1,000 jobs.
But last week, Texas-based Xtreme Power
and Clairvoyant Energy out of California
announced a plan to redevelop the 320-
acre site into an energy park housing new
manufacturing plants by 2011. The project is
expected to cost $725 million but will receive
$100 million in tax breaks from the state.
The new factories will produce environmen-
tally friendly solar panels and storage batter-
les and are expected to directly create 4,000
jobs, as well as indirectly support other state
industries like the glass industry.
On a national level, the park is part of a
necessary movement for cleaner energy.
The age of dependence on non-renew-
able, carbon-emission-producing oil and
unhealthy fossil fuels is coming to an end
- the rising demand for fuel-efficient vehi-
cles is evidence of that. Solar panels and
storage batteries are a vital component of
renewable energy and efficiency, and that's
the direction the country is headed.
But renewable energy options are par-
ticularly important for Michigan, because
they help diversify our staggering economy.
Gov. Jennifer Granholm has been advocat-
ing this point for years, focusing specifical-

ly on increasing the wind and solar energy
industries - with good reason. Alternative
energy is a growing industry, and with the
creation of the Wixom energy park, Michi-
gan has the opportunity to be a leader in
this field. The state desperately needs to
move beyond its traditional base of heavy
manufacturing, and being at the forefront
of the clean energy movement will spell
success for the state economy.
The energy park will also directly benefit
Wixom residents, creating much-needed
jobs in a state with the highest unemploy-
ment rate in the country - about 15 percent,
according to the Michigan Department of
Energy, Labor & Economic Growth. four
thousand jobs might seem like nothing,
but the industry should grow, and with it,
attract more jobs.
The costs can hardly be compared to the
benefits for the generations to come - the
state's $100 million investment should pay
large dividends. The energy park should
serve as a successful paradigm for future
endeavors in solar and renewable power.
Now if only the legislature can follow up
,the Wixom plant with an even greater push
for clean energy, Michigan can truly join
the 21st century as a leader in the field.

henever I hear legislators,
TV pundits or my fellow
classmates praising Presi-
dent Barack Obama
for saving the
national economy
with last Febru-
ary's stimulus
plan, I am infuriat-
ed. It is impossible
for the American
Recovery and
Reinvestment ActV
of 2009 to have VINCENT
done anything but PATSY
made the economy_
worse. The govern-
ment can't just rise out of the system
and save it - it is akin to trying to fill
the deep end of a pool by taking water
from the shallow end. In its attempt
to stimulate the economy, the govern-
ment borrows money, takes resources
away from the public and depresses
another part of the economy. For
this reason, all governmental policy
directed at stimulating the economy,
namely fiscal and monetary mea-
sures, are doomed to failure. The
government can only create jobs by
destroying other ones.
The inability of stimulus plan sup-
porters to understand this may stem
from misconceptions about the roles
of the public and private sectors of the
economy. The truth is that the private
economy consists of people working
cooperatively to produce goods and
satisfy consumer demand. The public
sector - that is, the government sec-
tor - can only maintain itself by seiz-
ing resources from the private sector
to fund whatever political goals cur-
rently exist, whether they unemploy-
ment benefits, public works, bailouts,
wars or anything else. The govern-
ment does this through either taxation
or borrowing. Far from stimulating
the economy, the government is really
just leeching off of it.

All this government leeching is
actually a double tax. By using my
money to buy goods and services, the
price of these goods and services goes
up. When the government taxes the
public, it decreases their amount of
resources, thus decreasingthe amount
of consumption. If the government
builds a bridge, it costs more for pri-
vate contractors and business owners
to build their own projects because
workers and materialshavebeentaken
out of the economy. The stimulus plan
essentially takes my money and uses it
to outbid me in the market.
But just as taxation hurts the econ-
omy, so too does government borrow-
ing from the private sector. Every
dollar that the government borrows
makes it more difficult for small and
large businesses to find credit. The
sheer lunacy of this is that while the
government spends money on unem-
ployment benefits, business owners
lack the ability to buy machines or to
keep people employed because the
government is using all of the sav-
ings. All things equal, the increased
borrowing by the government leads to
either a rise in interest rates and/or a
decrease in private consumption. This
has the same effect as taxation, except
not only do the taxpayers have to pay
the original amount but they have to
pay the interest, too.
Although we have all been indoctri-
nated to think that there exists some-
where an "economy" and we interact
with it when we have a job or buy
things, this is not the case at all. Your
wages ultimately do notcome from you
employer, but rather from what you
produce and exchange with other peo-
ple. We are all consumers, and those
of us who are producers - those of us
who have private sector jobs - produce
goods to satisfy consumer demand. We
receive money wages which represent
what we have produced.
In our modern economy, dollar bills

are essentially claims to goods. One
hundred dollars can be exchanged for
$100 worth of goods. Since money is
in a state of perpetual barter between
all goods, once there is enough money,
there is no need for any more. This is
especially true in our paper money
standard of today. Money, like the
yard or meter, is just a relative value
by which we can measure value and
coordinate action. When the Federal
Reserve creates new money, the only
social effect is to dilute the purchasing
power of the existing units. If the Fed
doubled the money supply overnight,
would we be richer? If the Fed adds
three percent per year, which is its
current policy goal, will we be richer?
All that will happen is that the value of
our existing dollars will become hope-
lessly diluted.
The government
can't magically
fix the economy.
So in response to an economic cri-
sis, if the government can only cre-
ate jobs by destroying others and the
Federal Reserve can only create more
money by diluting the current supply,
the only possible conclusion to govern-
ment policy is a chronic and perpetu-
al depression. As supposed experts
debate the merits of the first stimulus
(actually the second - Bush's failed,
as well) and the possibility of enacting
a second, I hope that they will remem-
ber this. No government stimulus can
make you wealthier without making
everyone else poorer.

A failed method of assessment

Last fall, my test scores were noth-
ing short of abysmal. These low scores
have forced me to reconsider what ben-
efit, if any, one gains from the test-tak-
ing culture's prevalence in academia.
Too often, I find myself cramming for
tests and memorizinginformation only
to find that after the exam has passed,
most of that knowledge is gone from
my memory. I'm sure other students
can relate.
While this rote style of learning is
conducive to test taking, it's largely
detrimental to substantive learning.
Most unfortunately, rote exams tend
to assess minor details rather than a
broader understanding of philosophi-
cal concepts or ideas that lie at the crux
of all disciplines. Typically, testing and
grades are primarily used for assess-
ment. Butthey are also used as a means
of motivation. Learning motivated by
grades often results in a superficial
approach to studying that offers little
benefit to the student.
Instead, substantive learning should
be motivated by genuine interest from
both the student and instructor. It is
essential that professors demonstrate
passionforthesubject.Afterall,profes-
sors are in a unique position to inspire
passion in students that won't come
from test preparation. This is an essen-
tial tools to facilitate the sustained and
substantive learning process that leads
students to one of the ultimate goals of
higher education - a commitment to

lifelong learning.
Exams are an academic convention,
and our culture rewards individu-
als that excel at taking tests. But this
is a skill that is only useful within the
academic context. Imagine a boss that
evaluated employees' performance
with an exam and a letter grade. This
would provide little substantive feed-
back and offer no tangible guidance
for improvement. This raises another
question - shouldn't academia assess
and reward students using real-world
methods? Wouldn't this better prepare
students for their professional careers?
To answer this we must consider the
skills that are most valuable in a profes-
sional setting.
In my experience, persuasive writ-
ingis anindispensible skill inthework-
place, which is why many organizations
evaluate applicants using writing sam-
ples. In addition, the ability to collabo-
rate in a productive manner is essential
because the most pressing challenges
in science or the humanities are often
complex - solving them requires the
integration of multiple perspectives.
Effective problem solving also requires
that individuals be able to think cre-
atively and offer innovative insight.
The test-taking culture doesn't con-
tribute to these ends. In fact, test tak-
ing, which is almost always a solitary
endeavor, is antithetical to the collab-
orative culture that is at the core of
real-world problem solving.

Alternatively, academia could imple-
ment more realistic means of assess-
ment by encouraging creative thinking
and communication from students as
well as group projects that emphasize
collaboration. This approach would
expose students to complex realities
and foster critical thinking abilities
that ultimately enable real learning.
In turn, this will instill students with
a lifelong love of learning and prepare
for aknowledge-basedeconomy,which
will champion innovation above pure
knowledge.
While academia is often considered
to be rational and forward-thinking,
it's utterly conservative when it comes
to modes of assessment. This conserva-
tism places tradition and convenience
for the assessors above the potential
benefits of new ways of evaluation.
It's time to seriously consider and
experiment with novel methods to
better prepare students for real-world
challenges. A new group for graduates
and undergraduates called Students for
Assessment Reform is starting. SAR's
mission is to promote a cross-campus
dialogue on new methods of student
assessment and provide recommenda-
tions to University leaders. If you're
interested in joining or learning more,

'Steve' is all about awful

By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
An abhorrently poor excuse
for art and an insult to crossword
puzzle-lovers
everywhere, a
new film has
opened this All About
weekend to
remind us all Steve
of the inepti-
tude of certain At Quality16
members of the and Showcase
movie indus- 20th Century Fox
try. Low bud-
get, poor actors,
weak scripts - thrdw Sandra
Bullock into the mix as an annoy-
ing faux-nerd and you may end up
with "All About Steve."
Bullock ("The Proposal") plays a
crossword-puzzle designer named
Mary Horowitz who works for a
Sacramento, CA paper. Sexually
frustrated and over-the-top eccen-
tric, she struggles with the monot-
ony of her everyday life. When her
parents - with whom she is tem-
porarily living - arrange a date
for her, she discovers that her ini-
tial misgivings about her parents'
taste in dates are unfounded. Steve
(Bradley Cooper, "The Hangover")

immediately arouses her, and she
proceeds to embark upon one of
the most awkward sexual endeav-
ors that many viewers will ever
have the misfortune of seeing.
During the odd tryst, Mary's
encyclopedic rant (trust me, you'd
actually have to see it to believe
it) confuses and repulses the mild-
mannered Steve, who interrupts
their experience to inform her that
he has been called to work. Since
he works as an on-site TV camera-
man with an ambitious news team,
he explains he'll be traveling cross-
country to follow current events.
During the course of his explana-
tion, Mary misinterprets him and
decides that she is madly in love
with Steve and would sooner stalk
him like a serial killer than aban-
don her feelings.
On the surface, the plot seems
to have potential, but any and all of
that potential is ruined by the intel-
lectually ineptfashion in which the
movie presents itself, The screen-
writer, Kim Barker, must have
assumed the film's viewers are just
as stupid as she is, and considering
the only other film in her portfolio
is "License to Wed," they actually
might be. It seems ridiculous and
patronizing to reiterate plot devel-

opment to viewers in the dialogue
rather than letting them figure it
out for themselves.
Even worse is the stance the
movie takes on the subject of
female stalkers. Since rom-coms
are generally marketed toward
women, it's understandable that
many of them take a pro-fem
stance. However, when the pro-
tagonist is a character study in
Sandra Bullock
makes anything
even worse.
mental illness, it doesn't seem
apropos to portray Steve as crazy
for not taking advantage of his sit-
uation. If Mary could carry herself
with even a hint of typical sanity,
viewers might sympathize with
her position. But sanity is nowhere
to be found in this film, as is evi-
denced by numerous plot holes,
forced acting and a sensationalist
ending. More derision could be
expressed about "Steve," but why
waste perfectly good derision?

Wow. He has a really big ... forehead.
Same old Leno

Jay's new talkshow
basically revives his
'Tonight Show' stint
By ERIC CHIU
DailyArts Writer
Whenever "The Tonight Show"
changes hands, things don't go
smoothly. When
Jay Leno took
over NBC's "The
Tonight Show"
in 1992, a dis-
gruntled David Leno Show
Letterman
jumped ship for Weekdays
CBS. Likewise, at10p'm.
this spring's NBC
Leno-to-Conan
O'Brien "Tonight
Show" handover has been dismal
for ratings, with Letterman con-
sistently walloping O'Brien.
It's into this less-than-favorable
environmentthat NBC has launched
"The Jay Leno Show," a nightly talk
show that moves Leno's "Tonight
Show" shtick into primetime. The
set notwithstanding, Leno on "The
Jay Leno Show" is virtually identical
to Leno on "The Tonight Show" - a
testament to how much NBC wanted
Leno to stay with the network.
From the opening minutes
(where Leno high-fives the audi-
ence before going into his usual
monologue), to the return of old
segments from "The Tonight
Show," viewers will be hard-
pressed to notice much of a differ-
ence between this "new" show and

the Leno they're used to.
The show does try to make
some minor additions to Leno's
"Tonight Show" formula, add-
ing segments filled by a rotating
roster of comedians to the usual
interviews and musical perfor-
mances. Even still, "The Jay Leno
Show" retreads familiar territory.
This is, for all intents and pur-
poses, "The Tonight Show With
Jay Leno, Again," and admittedly,
NBC didn't set the bar much high-
er than that. Giving Leno another
show was presumably driven more
by the fear of Leno defecting after
his contract expired than by any
altruism on NBC's part.
As Monday's premiere showed
repeatedly, watching Leno essen-
tially do the same thing he's been
doing since the early '90s only
underscores Leno's unambitious
middlebrow appeal. An obnoxious-
ly unfunny pre-taped segment early
in the show with comedian Dan
Finnerty was forgettable enough,
with Finnerty singing about a car
wash for an excruciatingly long five
minutes. And the interview seg-
ments didn't fare much better.
Granted, the sit-down interview
is virtually archaic at this point,
but it doesn't play well to Leno's
relative strengths as a host. Leno's
interviewing style has never been
especially compelling, lacking the
congeniality of Craig Ferguson
("The Late Late Show") or the
curmudgeonly unpredictability
of Letterman. Unfortunately, the
show's interview format - which
eschews Leno's traditional desk
for a pair of chairs - only empha-

sizes Leno's weaknesses.
His opening interview with
Jerry Seinfeld, which had the two
batting around softball questions
before Oprah made a surprise
appearance, was lifeless enough to
make Jimmy Fallon's interviews
seem dynamic.
Likewise, his interview with
Kanye West was cringe-worthy,
with Leno making West tear up
after asking him how West's moth-
er - who died in 2007 - would
have felt about his outburst at
the MTV Video Music Awards on
Sunday. Outside of that, though,
the show's inaugural outing was
wholly surprise-free, with prat-
falls, jokes about erectile dysfunc-
tion and "Headlines" (a "Tonight
Show" segment where Leno high-
lights funny newspaper headlines)
padding out the hour.
If all this sounds familiar, it's
because Leno'sbeen doing it for the
past 17 years, and he carries it over
into "The Jay Leno Show" largely
untouched. Leno has always been
a comic who delivers, in his own
words, "big tent" comedy, and the
show is a perfect vehicle for that.
Leno, the experienced comedian,
delivers jokes that everyone can
laugh with at 10 p.m.
But at the same time, the new
show's eagerness to please, along
with the fact that it's essentially a
rebranded "Tonight Show," won't
do much to win Leno many new
converts. After all, aiming toward
the middle certainly might be com-
fortable for Leno, but playing it safe
all the time tends to get dull after a
while.

dropouts, middle-aged divorcees
and old people keeping their minds
active as they circle the drain of
eternity."
This may or may not be true
for most community colleges, but
either way, the Greendale bunch
is a motley crew that makes for
amusing television.
In "Community," former lawyer
Jeff Winger (Joel McHale, "The
Soup") returns to Greendale Com-
munity College to earn a degree
after his first one gets revoked.
Thinking he can bribe and barter
his way through school just as eas-
ily as in the court room, he starts a
study group with the sole intention
of getting closer to the cute girl,
Britta (newcomer Gillian Jacobs).
Of course, word spreads, the group
grows and Jeff finds himself over-
whelmed, realizing he may need to

do a little work after all.
The premise and storyline
behind the show aren't anything
incredibly unique. The protago-
nist always had it easy and sud-
denly finds he can't just glide
through life. He also unintention-
ally becomes the leader of a group
of social misfits and helps them
all find their sense of self. It's like
"Freaks and Geeks" meets "The
Simple Life."
Fortunately, the writers aren't
blind to their conventional for-
mula and make fun of it through-
out the show. Ironic humor ensues.
Jeff apologizes for confiding in the
cafeteria worker by telling her
he was raised on television and
"conditioned to believe that every
black woman over SO was a cosmic
mentor." And Abed (Danny Pudi,
"Greek") frequently makes allu-
sions to how similar their situation
is to "The Breakfast Club."
The cast of "Community"
is nothing short of impressive,
including accomplished actors
such as Chevy Chase ("Saturday
Night Live"), Alison Brie ("Mad
Men") and Donald Glover ("30
Rock"). More important, though,
is the quality of the characters
they'reportraying.Everyoneinthe
study group is incredibly eccen-
tric yet still somehow believable
and maybe even a little relatable.
It's a worn-out ploy, but everyone
is a little bit of an outcast in their

own way and, by exaggerating that
notion, "Community" makes itself
surprisingly relevant.
A large fault in the show is that
it's unclear where exactly these
characters are headed. The pilot
is cute, but it doesn't really give
any clues as to what will hap-
pen throughout the season, aside
from the fact that Winger is defi-
nitely going to have to study for
that Spanish test. Without any
idea of what anyone is working
Funny with no
staying power.
toward (Finish the semester? Get
a degree?), it's tough to find the
motivation to continue watching.
Chances are the characters will
all learn something about them-
selves, Jeff's world will continue
to be shaken up and there will be
plenty of biting sarcasm along the
way (or at least there'd better be
sarcasm - otherwise this might
all get a little too heartwarming).
"Community" is not a force that
will change the way people think
about community college. It also
isn't a show that'll keep you wait-
ing for the next episode. It's simply
a funny show with agreat cast, and
maybe that's all it needs.

By KAVI PANDEY
DailyArts Writer
A murder mystery in Antarctica
is an intriguing concept, especially
considering the
sheer original-
ity of its seques-
tered setting. Whtout
The gravely cold
temperatures At Qualityl6
and lack of a per- and Showcase
manent human Warer Bros.
population have
made the chilly
continent mostly extrinsic in cin-
ema circles (save for "March of
the Penguins"), but its isolation
and hazardous environment are
ideal for inciting thrills and plac-
ing characters in peril. Still, "Whi-
teout" fails to capitalize on its
unusual locale, instead becoming a
film that relies upon enough genre
conventions to leave one scouring
for synonyms of the word "cliche."
Based on the graphic novel of
the same name, "Whiteout" fol-
lows U.S. Marshall Carrie Stetko
(Kate Beckinsale, "Underworld").
She is stationed on an Antarctic
base as she investigates the grisly
death of a geologist. Stetko is also
under a severe time constraint -
the base is going to be evacuated
in three days before the devastat-
ing Antarctic winter sets in. Stetko
must confront animportant moral

dilemma: Should she get the hell
out of Antarctica and leave the
crime to other authorities, or fol-
low her case to the end and be
stranded on the base for the next
six months? Naturally, our virtu-
ous (read: generic) lead chooses
the latter.
Other characters in "Whiteout"
fill out a checklist of unabashed
stereotypes: the nurturing doctor
nearing retirement (Tom Sker-
ritt, TV's "Brothers & Sisters"),
the straight arrow U.N. officer
(Gabriel Macht, "The Spirit") and
the cocky pilot with an unquench-
able libido (Alex O'Loughlin,
It has Antarctica
and nothing else.
TV's "Moonlight"). As expected,
any sort of development for each
lethargically performed character
is nonexistent.
This lack of character depth
isn't solely responsible for tank-
ing the film, as Stetko's own "dark
past" is yet another hackneyed,
superfluous element of the story.
This backstory, supposedly show-
ing the audience her vulnerability
and toughness, unfolds through
a series of sepia-toned flashbacks
(just go you know it was a lorig

time ago). Her character's "revela-
tion" is not only predictable - it
severely disrupts the flow of the
film, often causing it to feel more
like a Lifetime Original Movie
than a high-tension thriller.
This is unfortunate, as "White-
out" sets a perfect pace with a mar-
velous plane crash in its opening
sequence. The filmmakers, how-
ever, included too much dialogue,
too many extraneous subplots and
too little action to maintain the
level of excitement.
Among the film's few bright
spots is its clever mixing of genres.
Stetko's encounters with the
pickaxe-wielding villain resemble
scenes from decent slasher mov-
ies - a frenetic camera follows
the silent, menacing killer as he
chases his prey through gale-force
blizzards. If the entire film had
followed the approach of these
well-crafted but sparse confronta-
tions, the result may have been a
competent horror movie.
"Whiteout" features several
breathtaking shots of the Ant-
arctic landscape (hopefully they
weren't constructed through CGI,
but they probably were). Of course,
since there's little else the film-
makers have to be proud of in the
film, these shots are frustratingly
overused, contributing to the bru-
tally slow pace of this poor excuse
for an action thriller.

For Thursday, Sept. 17, 2009
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
You might feel so discouraged about
something at work today (or possibly to
do with your health) that you end up in
an argument with someone.
Understandable - but not cool.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Today, romance seems to be in the toi-
let. Your relations with children also are
burdensome. Don't let this get you
down, because it will lead to arguments
with others.
GEMINI
(May 21 toJune 20)
Something at home or within your
family is either depressing or oppressive.
You feel world-weary. Don't react by
having verbal power struggles with oth-
ers.
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
Today your glass is half-empty, not
half-full. Don't worry - millions of
people feel the same way today. (It's
always darkest before it gets pitch
hlack.)
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Financial matters are disappointing.
This could discourage you. Actually,
next year you can benefit from the
resources of wealth from others. Don't
be worried.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
You feel like you have the burdens of
the world on your shoulders. But actu-
ally, you're getting stronger. Avoid ver-
bal confrontations with others about
money and possessions. (Not a good day
for these!)
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Privately, you're worried and anxious
about something. In turn, this makes
your communication with others too
aggressive. (Acknowledge to yourself

that this is a poor day to have an argu-
ment!)
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Someone older or more experienced
might be critical of your efforts today.
Bummer. Don't take this to heart. (And
don't have an explosive response,
because you'll regret it later.)
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22to Dec. 21)
It's discouragingto deal with authority
figures - parents, bosses, teachers and
the police - today. Nevertheless, hold
your temper in check. Don't get in an
argument!
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22to Jan. 19)
News about travel, publishing, the
media and higher education might be
disappointing today. Don't worry
even a hurricane only lasts one day.
Soon this will be history.
AQUARIUS
(Jan.20to Feb. 18)
You might be disappointed in your
share of something or how something is
divided. Don't lash out at others. This
wilt make things worse.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
Relations with partners and close
friends definitely are rocky right now.
Do yourself a favor and make important
decisions when everything is calm.
(Then you'll know what you're doing.)
YOU BORN TODAY Once you
choose your course, you persevere. It is
this dogged persistence that is the key to
your success in life. Obstacles do not
deter you. In fact, you function well
under pressure. People enjoy your wry
sense of humor. You have a strong
respect for justice. This year, all kinds of
new beginnings have opened doors for
you. Next year, relationships are impor-
tant.

.Administration
unveils rules for
fuel efficiency

Standards call for
new vehicles to
average 35.5 miles
per gallon by 2016
WASHINGTON (AP) - With
global talks on climate change
looming, the Obama administra-
tion sought to gain momentum
yesterday by unveiling its plan to
require better gas mileage for cars
and trucks and the first-ever rules
on vehicle greenhouse gas emis-
sions. 1
Transportation Secretary Ray
LaHood and EPA Administrator
Lisa Jackson released the proposed
regulations at the White House,
the follow-up to President Barack
Obama's announcement in May
that the government regulations
would link emissions and fuel econ-
omy standards.
"This action will give our auto

"This marks asignificant advance

nation to a sustainable economy in

The new standards call for the
auto industry's fleet of new vehicles
to average 35.5 miles per gallon by
2016.
The proposal will cover vehicle
model years 2012 through 2016,
allowing auto companies to comply
at once with all federal require-
ments as well as standards pushed
by California and about a dozen
other states.
The administration estimated
the requirements would cost up
to $1,300 per new vehicle by 2016
- but that it would take just three
years to pay off that investment and
that the standards would save more
than $3,000 over the life of the
vehicle through better gas mileage.
Jackson said the new standards
will have the effect of taking 42
million cars off the road.
The proposal is expected to

sell a limited number of vehicles
in the United States could meet a

Goo e's 'Green Ener Czar'talks
COmpany's projects in campus visit

Bill Weihl talked
about the role of
private companies in
future of energy
By VALIANT LOWITZ
Daily StaffReporter
Google "Green Energy Czar" Bill
Weihl gave the keynote address at the
University's 14th annual Energy Fest
yesterday. The lecture, titled "Invent-
ing aClean Energy Future at Google,"
focused primarily on Google's newly
launched green initiatives.
Weihlheadsthegreenenergydivi-
sion at Google, which means he over-
sees the research and development
of new technologies with which to
reduce not just Google's carbon foot-

print but also world's carbon impact
at large.
The speech began with a discus-
sion of Google's latest energy pro-
gram, RE<C. The program focuses
on engineering ways to reduce the
cost of producing clean energy.
The point of the project, accord-
ing to Google's website, is "to cre-
ate renewable energy cheaper than
coal (and) will focus on advanced
solar thermal power, wind power
technologies, and enhanced geo-
thermal systems."
Weihl also spoke about Google
PowerMeter, which, if put into oper-
ation, would provide detailed infor-
mation about a specific household's
energy consumption.
"If you give people this kind of
data," Weihl said, "just through
simple behavior changes, with peo-
ple now aware of how much they're

using, they will on average reduce
their electricity use between 5and 15
percent."
Other initiatives Weihl talk-
ed about in the speech include
RechargeIT, aimed at accelerating
the adoption of electric vehicles
and Clean Energy 2030, a project
to find "a potential path to weaning
the U.S. off of coal and oil for elec-
tricity generation by 2030 (with
some remaining use of natural gas
as well as nuclear), and cutting oil
use for cars by 40 percent," accord-
ing to Google's official blog.
Weihl said he hoped Google's
leadership would drive innovation in
the clean energy sector. Areas Weihl
mentioned specifically included
solar, thermal, high-altitude wind
and enhanced geothermal energy.
Business senior Akash Jaggi said
he found the lecture to be "pretty

informative," but would have like to
have heard more about "what under-
graduates could do aboutstudying or
personal initiatives."
Rackham student Greg Buzzell,
who holds a Master of Business
Administration from the Business
School and a Master of Science from
the School of Natural Resources and
Environment, said that the big take-
away point from the lecture was that
"the private sector is going to have to
take the lead in this effort in order to
see results."
He added: "It'sgreatthat...Google
is tackling this problem, even if it's
not their core competency."
"We have an opportunity, no an
obligation, to take a stand," Weihl
said to the crowd.

Lutz: GM changed course with commercials

GM's new marketing
guru aims to change
company's image
HIGHLAND TOWNSHIP,
Mich. (AP) - Bob Lutz, General
Motors' new marketing guru, jok-
ingly wants to put a new ending
on a much-panned ad featuring
a movie director hugging a new
Buick LaCrosse sedan and treating
it like a model on a beach.
In Lutz's version, a tidal wave
would crash over the ad set, wash-
ing everything away but the car,
which is where the focus should
have been, he says.
Vice Chairman Lutz, formerly
head of product development, says
GM has spent too much time and
money on advertising that hasn't
changed with widespread percep-
tion that the company's.vehicles
aren't as good as its competitors.
Speaking yesterday at an event

north of Detroit, Lutz said mem-
bers of the government's auto task
force and new board Chairman
Edward Whitacre Jr. agreed and
also pushed for change.
Whitacre, who is featured in
the first round of ads, as well as
task force members, told GM
executives that the company had
made great strides in product
development and manufacturing
quality, "but we were seriously
deficient in getting the word out,"
Lutz said.
GM emerged from bankruptcy
protection in July and has received
$50 billion in federal aid. The com-
pany is 60.8 percent owned by the
government, which ousted the old
CEO and has been pulling other
strings despite statements that
it doesn't want to run a car com-
pany.
The old ads, Lutz said, showed
happy families washing their cars
and GM vehicles on winding roads,
but did little to change the pub-

lic perception that the automaker
builds inferior vehicles.
Lutz has scrapped the direc-
tor and other ads in favor of those
focused on vehicles. GM kicked off
the campaign last weekend with
spots featuring Whitacre chal-
lenging people to try the compa-
ny's vehicles and offering a 60-day
money-back guarantee. A new
wave of ads starting Sept. 21 will
compare new GM vehicles directly
with competitors.
"Where we are competitively
superior we will say so," Lutz said.
He spoke at a dealership where
he marked the arrival of the new
GMC Terrain. It's a midsize cross-
over vehicle designed to take on
the Toyota RAV-4, Honda CRV
and the BMW X3.
Lutz said GM will greatly
increase its ad spending, making
claims that its products are better
than models from topflight brands
such as Lexus, BMW or Acura.
GM's corporate and brand

advertising have gone to a large
number of different ad agencies
over the years. Leo Burnett cur-
rently has Buick and GMC and
had Pontiac until GM decided to
shed the brand. Campbell-Ewald
has had the Chevrolet account for
years. Modernista now has Cadil-
lac.
Jack Nerad, executive market
analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said
GM's strategy will give more pub-
licity to competitors, but GM has
little to lose because it wasn't on
the consideration list for many
buyers anyway.
"That might at least pique some
curiosity," he said. "I think one
of the keys with General Motors
is getting butts into seats. Once
people sample, I think they will be
impressed."
GM's newer products are com-
petitive with the best automakers,
Nerad said, but some older vehicles
are mediocre and may not impress
people.


FINANCIAL AID
From Page 1A
anteed student loan program sim-
ply wasn't efficient for taxpayers or
operating in the best interest of stu-
dents and families," Miller said.
"Lenders and banks had a great
deal," Miller continued. "They
received taxpayer subsidies for
doing business that has become
highly profitable to them, but the
subsidies continue."
An analysis of the legislation by
the non-partisan Congressional
Budget Office found that by end-
ing the guaranteed loans, the new
program would save taxpayers
about $87 billion in mandatory fees
owed to lenders over the next 10
years, while only adding $7 billion
in discretionary spending - mostly
administrative costs - for the fed-
eral government.
Hence, the CBO estimates that
the net impact on federal spending
of the proposed changes would be a
reduction of about $80 billion over
the next decade.
With thatsurplus, Congressional
leaders have big plans for revamp-
ing the nation's higher education
landscape with more financial aid
being available to students of both
public and private institutions.
Most notable among the new
spending would be a $40 billion
investment in the Pell Grant schol-
arship program. With that money,
the maximum annual Pell Grant
scholarship would increase from

$5,550 in 2010 to $6,900 by 2019.
Additionally, starting in 2011, the
amount of the award would be like-
ly to outpace rises in the Consumer
Price Index by 1 percent.
On the conference call, Duncan
stressed the long-term impact these
Pell Grant investments could have
on the aspirations of young people
around the country.
"To me that's so important not
just for our current college stu-
dents, not just for our juniors and
seniors who are about to go to col-
lege," Duncan said of the additional
Pell Grant investments, "but reilly
for our fifth and sixth graders who
are smart, who are working hard
but because mom and dad might
have lost a job or because they've
taken a huge pay cut that dream of
college too often starts to die at a
very early age."
For the 2007-2008 academic
year, 3,349 University students
received more than $9 million in aid
from Pell Grants, Margaret Rodri-
guez, senior associate director of
the office of Financial Aid told the
Daily in February. That means that
each student receiving a Pell Grant
got an average of $2,776.
Another aspect of the legisla-
tion, that Duncan termed a brand-
new program that he's "never seen
anything like ... before," is $3 billion
to strengthen college access oppor-
tunities and programs to help stu-
dents complete their degrees.
"The goal here is to dramatically
increase attainment," Duncan said.
"The presidet has drawn a line in

the sand. He said by 2020 we have
to again be the country that leads
the world in the percent of college
graduates."
According to the Organiza-
tion for Economic Cooperation
and Development's Education at
a Glance 2008 report, the United
States ranks behind nine other
industrialized countries in the per-
centage of the population aged 25
to 34 that has attained a post-sec-
ondary education.
"We're convinced that we
have to educate our way to a bet-
ter economy," Duncan said, "and
that college access and completion
fund will reward those states and
those schools that are dramati-
cally increasing not just access but
attainment."
According to Duncan, the legis-
lation will also funnel an additional
$6 billion to the Perkins Loan pro-
gram - a campus-based program
that provides low-cost federal loans
to students, according to the com-
mittee's website.
Additionally, the legislation will
simplify the well-known FAFSA
form, which dictates how much a
family is expected to contribute
financially to their child's costs for
college.
The most ardent opponent of the
legislation is, not surprisingly, the
lending industry itself.
In a Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion article from last week, Martha
Holler, a spokeswoman for Sallie
Mae, the largest financer of student
loans, downplayed the importance

of the CBO's analysis of the pro-
posed legislation.
"This CBO score confirms that
mandatory savings of $87 billion
are achievable," Holler said, ref-
erencing that such gains could be
attained by both the House bill or
through a proposed bill that the
industry has been pushing.
The lending industry's Student
Loan Community Proposal, which
was drafted as an alternative to
the House Democrats' legislation,
would result in net federal savings
of $67 billion in the next decade,
compared to $80 billion in the
Democrats version.
Despite their objections to the
House proposal, Holler said lenders
would "continue to work with the
(Obama) administration and Con-
gress to create the best program
for students, families, schools and
taxpayers."
Rep. Miller said that the House
would start taking up the bill today
and complete the amendment pro-
cess tomorrow afternoon.
The legislation would then go to
Senate, where Miller said there is "a
lot of anticipation" about the bill.
"Some people say it's going to be
more difficult in the Senate," Miller
said. "But I think we're relying on
students and others to persuade the
Senate that this is the right thing to
do."
He added: "And I think we're
goingto be successful."
Ultimately,Millersaidhe expects
the legislation to be on "the presi-
dent'sdesk before the holidays."

Former Michigan
defensive coordinator
is now head coach at
Eastern Michigan
By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
He may be two years removed
from the minds of Wolverine
fans, but he works 10. minutes
down Washtenaw Ave. First-year
Eastern Michigan football coach
Ron English was responsible for
recruiting the two oldest classes of
Michigan's current defense.
That may make this upcoming
weekend a bit awkward.
"It will be weird because (Eng-
lish) actually recruited me, and
he's the reason Im here rightnow,"
junior safety Troy Woolfolk said.
The voice he will hear from the
other sideline this weekend will
be the same screaming he heard
as a freshman on English's stellar
Michigan defense in 2007.
"(I want to) show him that he
recruited me for a reason, so I'm
going to try and go hard against
him," Woolfolk said.
English worked under former
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr for
five seasons before Wolverine
coach Rich Rodriguez came to
Ann Arbor.
With Michigan, English
coached the secondary for three
years before taking over as the
defensive coordinator for his final

D ear Freshmen,
You're spoiled. There's no way to
sugarcoat it.
Your first two football games really couldn't
have gone better. A blowout home opener win
-the first one I've experienced, too, and I'm
a junior. A last-minute,
come-from-behind victory _
behind a true freshman
quarterback. And against
larger-than-life Charlie
Weis and his Fighting Irish,
no less.
Hell, the last time I saw
Michigan beat Notre Dame,-
a matchup of two 0-2 teams NICOLE
with little dignity left AUERBACH
to lose, it was more of a -
relief than anything. And
last year, after a three-and-a-half hour trek
to rainy South Bend, my friends and I were
rewarded with a six-fumble performance by
the Wolverines.
For two years, we Michigan students have

found ourselves the butt of college football
jokes.
We've been sent YouTube videos of the
Appalachian State game, received the doz-
ens of "LOL Michigan football" texts and sat
through last year's Toledo disaster.
You probably think Saturday nights are
the best party nights of the week. Everyone's
happy, everyone's singing the fight song.
That hasn't always been the case. Last year,
people would limp out of the Big House with
frowns on their faces until Tuesdays. You're
familiar with the postgame singing and smiles
in the student section? Imagine the exact
opposite.
To make matters worse, the Wolverines
haven't beaten Ohio State since you were in
seventh grade. And Rich Rod lost that recruit-
ing battle for Terrelle Pryor, even after Green-
wood hosted a block party in his honor. But I
guess those are things you might realize that
third weekend in November.
For now, relish what you've so luckily been
given - wins. I only saw three of them last

year, so you're two-thirds of the way there
already.
So, where do you go from here, young Wol-
verines?
Well, on paper, there are two "easy" games
coming up, and both will have noon starts. But
that doesn't mean you should get lazy.
Wake up. Put onyour maize student T-shirt.
Go to the game, and don't miss kickoff. Maybe
even paint your face.
(Side note: Girls, I don't care how large those
T-shirts are. They are shirts, not dresses. It's not
time to impressboys. Do you really think they're
focusing on girls when it's a Football Saturday?)
And I'll repeat this: Go to the game. It
doesn't matter if you can't pronounce Ypsilan-
ti or that you didn't know Indiana had varsity
teams other than basketball. Just go.
You'll only get eight home games this year.
And if you're lucky - which you obviously
have been thus far - you'll get about 30 Foot-
ball Saturdays as an undergraduate at Michi-
gan. Winning makes them better, and you
shouldn't miss a game that could end in sing-
ing "The Victors."
A few more precious pieces of
advice:
Don't stay in to do homework.
This is especially true in Sep-
tember. All your 100-level intro
classes and one-credit mini-
courses won't get tough, well,
ever.
Don't ever complain about
waking up at 7 a.m. to tailgate.
How often can you grab a beer
before breakfast, really?
And last but not least (and I'm
not trying to sound like the ridic-
ulous paragraph on the back of
the student T-shirts, but it's good
advice), don't leave the games
early - for any reason.
I'once lost my ticket, forgot
money, blistered my feet and got
sunburned on half of my body.
(And walked uphill in the snow
both ways, of course.) It was still
worth staying till the very last
snap.
And that was the App State
game, too.

One moment, decades of progress

f I reduce my mother and sis-
ter's college experiences to
just a few sentences, they have
similar profiles. Both were admit-
ted into elite private universities
(Harvard for my sister, Williams
College for my mother), both were
(or are) serious students and both
are people ofcolor.
But there are a few important
differences. For one, my mother is
black and my sister, like myself, is
biracial. For another, my mother
went to college in the '70s, while
my sister is a freshman this year. I
didn't realize how profound a dif-
ference her race would make in
Isabel's college experience until
my family dropped her off in Cam-
bridge last month.
In the past, my parents seldom
talked about their experiences of
race relations during college. But
when they did, they mentioned how
the divides were very strict. If you
were black and didn't hang around
with the few other black kids a lot,
you were criticized. My sister and I
find this difficult to relate to, since
in neither of our academic careers
had we ever experienced anything
like it and we had both gone to very
diverse schools.
The first change we noticed was

when my parents and I were wait-
ing to meet my sister and drop her
things off at her dorm room. Dur-
ing prefrosh move-in, parents must
drive to the Harvard football sta-
dium and wait in a long line of cars
leading to the Yard, where each
student's family gets thirty min-
utes to unload outside the dorms.
We were in our cars, waiting in the
line, looking around and making
abrupt observations about the other
families ("Looks like a lot of people
from New Jersey," I noted from the
license plates in line) when I saw
that behind our rental minivan was
a silver Mercedes and two black
adults in front.
"Mom, look, we're not the only
black family here," I said. "Where?"
my mom asked, and looked around
until she saw where I was pointing.
It may have been the 21st century,
but there was a part of all of us that
hadn't expected to see black and
minority students at Harvard. We-
were excited.
The column of vehicles was mov-
ing every few minutes, so there
were a lot of people getting out and
strolling around. My mom got out of
the car and played it cool. The lady
in the other car took the bait, exit-
ing her car after a few moments.

I stayed inside, behind the tinted she and the other mother had gravi-

seemed almost like cosmic fashion, some famous Harvard parents, but

not as many black Harvard par-

from the traditional stereotype of
what kind of family sends a child
to Harvard. My mom had gone to
the elite Williams College, after all.
She was one of less than two dozen
black students there, and by my
mom's senior year, a large fraction
of them had dropped out. So it was
reassuring for my mother, who had
grown up in the more modest ech-
elons of America, to know she had
worked hard and gotten into a top-
notch school - and that years later,
she wouldn't need scholarships or
financial aid to send her children to
this kind of school.
When we were getting ready
to leave Isabel to catch our flight
back to Chicago, my mom cried and
hugged us both. Most of her tears
came from sending her last child
off to college, but I suspect a few
of them were also for being able to
send her daughter to a school she
had wished she could go to. She
knew that the divisiveness that had
colored her college years wouldn't
loom as large for her daughter, if it
even made an appearance at all.

FUTURE PROSPECTS
As a forum for the community
and by the community, AnnArbor.
com has vowed to evolve based on
readers'feedback.Onechangethat's
already on the agenda, according to
Dearing, is to add clear bylines to
stories on the homepage so read-
ers can more easily differentiate
between professional journalists
and bloggers.
With all of the community
involvement and even nationalhype
regarding the launch of AnnArbor.
com, many wonder where it stands
in terms of site traffic, to get a sense

for the site's popularity.
AnnArbor.com won't publicly
release numbers representing
site traffic, such as the number of
unique viewers on an hourly and
daily basis and how long readers
stay on the site, until the company
has had more time to determine
traffic trends with another month
or so. Dearing said that so far the
site activity he has monitored is
promising for the e-newspaper, and
that site traffic numbers have far
exceeded original expectations.
Although promising numbers
can suggest an optimistic future,
the community will determine the
fate of AnnArbor.com, and Dearing
knows this.
"What we're seeing is that peo-
ple are coming to the site, people
are using the site, we're hearing
encouragement from people," Dear-
ingsaid. "ButI thinkthat people are
still judging us and still waiting to
see us really prove ourselves, and I
understand that."

FROM HIGH COURT TO BIG HOUSE
Chief Justice John Roberts attended Saturday's game against
Notre Dame in Michigan Stadium as part of his visit marking
the 150th anniversary of Michigan Law School. From the presi-
dent's box, Roberts witnessed the neck-in-neckgame that ulti-
matelyended in Michigan'sfavor, 38-34.taut the Indiana native
didn't revel in the win with the rest of the stadium. Rumor has it
he has motioned for a recount to decide the game. We should
know theaofficial score sometime in January.

WHAT WOULD YOUR MAMA SAY, KANYE?
Kanye West once again made a fool of himself at the Video
Music Awards when he stole the mic from Best Female Video
winner Taylor Swift to proclaim that the award should have
gone to Beyonce. Jay Leno admonished West during his new
show: "What would your late mother say about your behav-
ior?" West pouted and looked remorseful, then got up and
performed his hit with Jay-Z and Rihanna. Considering the pun-
ishment for celebrity misbehavior is increased attention, Mrs.
West probably would have told her son to keep at it. No one
wins the fame game by being boring.

Not-so-trivial
pursuits
Behind students' grunt work
on the "Trivial Pursuit" set
At Ingalls Mall on the night of
Sept. 4, actor Chris Gorham was
portraying fictional University stu-
dent Paul Tarson in "Trivial Pur-
suits", a film that recently wrapped
up shooting in Ann Arbor. Having
just returned from losing abar triv-
ia tournament, he drunkenly blun-
dered through Roxette's "Joyride,"
barely balancing on the edge of the
fountain. "Hello, you fool!" he bel-
lowed, slapping his team T-shirt.
into the water. "I love you!"
Tarson, a college bar trivia mas-
ter, is a figure easily recognizable
on a college campus. He seems to
know everything except how to
approach his looming and uncer-
tain future. He also has a lot in
common with the few dozen Uni-
versity students who watched from
the sidelines of the Ingalls Mall
set. They were Screen Arts and
Cultures majors, movie buffs who
seem to know everything about
film except how to get a job mak-
ing it.
That's where the Michigan Film
Initiative makes things a tad easier.
The students on the set of "Trivial
Pursuits" weren't just looking in
longingly - they were earning a
highly needed line for their resu-
mes as production assistants:
Many students are no strang-
ers to entry-level grunt work, but
film students without connections
really might have to endure the
most grueling and mundane jobs
in all of interned servitude. And
that's only if they're able to land an
internship.
But a film like "Trivial Pursuits"
- an independent, feature-length
comedy starring Chris Parnell
("Saturday Night Live") - offers
a valuable opportunity to actually
help produce a feature film instead

of just file paperwork related to
one.
"When I go over there, it's
like going to a Screen Arts class,
because it's all of our students,"
said Mary Lou Chlipala, the pro-
gram coordinator for the Screen
Arts and Cultures Department.
Of course, that experience came
at a price for the 30 or so University
students who worked as produc-
tion assistants: long work weeks,
difficult requests and little to no
pay.
Chlipala said that the film's
producer, Anna Wenger, asked
her early in production to refer
four film students to work as pro-
duction assistants on the shoot.
But soon after, Wenger decided
to meet with 40 students in two
days, about 24 of whom ended up
on the "Trivial Pursuits" payroll
or receiving grant money from the
University to work. And when paid
positions filled up, more students
volunteered to work unpaid as pro-
duction assistants.
"We ended up with kids that
were like, 'We want to work for
free!"' Wenger said.
LSA senior Samara Rosenbaum
was happy to find some worth-
while production work on the set of
"Trivial Pursuits", even though she
wasn't being paid. Her prospects
in Los Angeles were anything but
promising.
"I was determined to find an
internship there," she said. "I tried
everything I could to stay in L.A.
and I found this mediocre intern-
ship."
But instead of making photo-
copies at a documentary company,
Rosenbaum grudgingly came back
to spend the summer in Michigan.
Soon after returning to Ann
Arbor, she heard about "Trivial
Pursuits" and started volunteer-
ing six days a week as the assistant
extras coordinator.
"We're not just getting coffee,"
she said. "We're doing things that
we can learn from and actually

made beer in Ann Arbor. The contest will take place at
the end of October, so get a batch fermenting. All types of
beer welcome - no mead, moonshine or hard cider.

contribute a lot to the film."
Katie Magill, a paid production
assistant and University alum,
said she has been working 80-hour
weeks filing paperwork, escorting
actors to and from set and insuring
equipment since the end of June.
The opportunity to do more on
a film than the average entry-level
production assistant also means
being obligated to put in long hours
- and being expected to accom-
plish any number of oddball tasks
necessary to keep production run-
ning smoothly.
Wenger introduced me to a pro-
duction assistant so versatile and
indomitable that she gave her a
nickname to match: Megan "The
Rock" Gilliam, a 2009 graduate
who received University money to
work on "Trivial Pursuits"
Gilliam has not only worked on
set, she has had to make sure that
the set would exist at all - like
when she was put in charge of find-

ing trailers for the cast and crew.
"I was not expecting to come in
and have to find six motor homes,"
Gilliam said. "They were like, 'Hey,
Megan, you're in transportation,
so you're gonna go find the motor
homes"'
Visibly tired but still attentive,
Gilliam was stationed Sept. 4 next
to the Law Quad overseeing the
base camp: a line of parked motor
homes for actors, trailers filled
with huge monitors and equipment
for editors, and a tented table filled
with all the catered food necessary
to keep cast and crew happy for a
14-hour workday.
"How to get coffee," she said,
gesturing to extension cords and a
generator set up on the lawn. "You
wouldn't believe how something
that simple can turn into a major
issue."
Fellow intern and LSA senior
Liam White made $100 for a 100-
hour week where he was respon-

sible for keeping passersby out of
the camera's eye. His voice could
be heard above all others as he told
the crew to secure the set before
the camera started rolling: "Lock
it down! Lock it down!"
"It steered me toward the idea of
being a director or writer," he said.
"I realized how stressful some of
the other parts can be. I learned
about getting shit done. It gave me
a real-world expectation of what
kind of hours I'll be working."
White and his coworkers
worked from sundown on Sept. 4
until 6 a.m. the next day. But such
long hours foster camaraderie, and
as any intern knows, making good
connections in the field is almost
more important than the real-
world work experience.
"Since I met all these people
through it, there's a lot more peo-
ple that I can call when I get out to
L.A.," White said.

Three things you can talk about this week:
1. The fate of the Michigan Promise Scholarship
2. Ladies Specials trains in India -
3. The anniversary of Wall Street's collapse
And three things you can't:

-ROBERT GIBBS, White House press
secretary, chiding CNN last Friday for
reporting that the Coast Guard had tried to
stop a boat on the Potomac River and that
shots were fired not far from Obama. The
Coast Guard was doing a training exercise

- ROBERT KUECH, an officer at the Coatesville
Police Department in Pennsylvania, describing a

busy street. Her mother, who was also in the car, had
smoked pot and then decided to let the girl drive

"I think it would be the third world war."
- MAKHENKESI STOFILE, sports minister for South Africa, expressing how he and his country will

YOUTUBE
VIDEO OF
THE WEEK
A "Mad Men" recap
Viewer beware:If you're a diehard
fan of the celebrated television show
"Mad Men," this video might offend.
Titled "Mad Men in 60 Seconds,"
this video flippantly and irreverently
mocks the show and its themes of
racial, class and gender conflict in just
over a minute. This parody is astute,
funny and, if you've seen the show,
right on target.
The video starts with the protago-
nist Don Draper strutting down the
halls of his New York advertising
agency, while a colleague says, "Morn-
ing, Don. How's the most genius ad
man in 1960s Manhattan doing?"
"Great," Don suavely replies, "except
for that history-changing event that
happened today." Pete offers a bit of
reprieve: "Scotch."
A few scenes later, an ad man and
a female receptionist are talking inti-
mately in a hallway. The man says that
he really enjoys the "aesthetics of this
era." To which she responds, "I don't
care much for black people." Then
they start making out in the hallway.
Without a doubt, the best scene
comes at the end, when a weary Drap-
er and his client are found in a dark
room, rubbing up against each other.
She moans, "scotch, cigarettes, skin-
ny ties" and "racism."
All the while, they're both smoking
cigarettes and Draper is drinking a
glass of scotch.

Dan Brown debate - Whether you love him or
hate him, it'll be hard to ignore the release yester-
day of Dan Brown's new book, "The Lost Symbol."
Brown provoked a firestorm with his previous
bestsellers, with literary snobs as well as many
Christians deriding him as a quack. It's time to
defuse the tension. Gather all your friends from the
two opposing camps and have a civil debate. Some
red winemight help keep things in check.

STUDY OF THE WEEK
Multitaskers are more easily distracted than others
People who multitask most frequently are more easily distracted
and less capable of disregarding irrelevant information than those who
don't multitask as often, according to a study published in Proceed-
ings of the National Academy of Sciences by researchers at Stanford
University.
In the study, the researchers examined 262 college undergradu-
ates, categorizing them into groups of high and low multitaskers.
To determine the level of multitasking, students were given a list of
different forms of media, including print, television, and computer-
based, and for each one they indicated what other forms they used at
the same time. The researchers then tested the students for memory,
ability to change from one task to another and ability to concentrate
on a single task.
The study found that the high multitaskers had lower scores on
these assessments than those who multitasked less often.

THE NEW FACE OF NEVW
AFTER THE ANN ARBOR NEWS CLOSED SHOP THIS SUMMER, ANNARBOR.COM EMERGED TO TAKE IT.
THE WEBSITE'S PUBLISHERS HERALD IT AS THE FUTURE OF JOURNALISM. BUT DO ANN ARBOR READ
BY LARISA ZADE I MAGAZINE STAFF WRITER

IS?
S PLACE.
ERS AGREE?


W hen The Ann Arbor News announced
March 23 it was closing after 174 years,
it left local readers at a loss for where to turn
to for city news.
But never fear, the News's upper echelon
declared. Ann Arbor's only daily wasn't really
dying-- it was being reborn as AnnArbor.com,
a web-based media company that would be a
pioneer in the news industry's inevitable turn
to paperless production.
It was a bold plan, one that tried to find a
silver lining in the otherwise consistent doom
and gloom of faltering newspapers across the
country. True, Ann Arbor is so far the largest
city to lose its only newspaper. But perhaps
also true is the fact that the publication's tran-
sition to something like AnnArbor.com was
bound to happen eventually anyway. And in a
brave new world of web-based news outlets, a
head start in mastering the market could only
help.
But as a business, the ,road to AnnArbor.
com's prosperity is laden with obstacles. The
website not only has to win former News read-
ers over to a new format but also has to solve
the riddle of how to finance a company almost
exclusively through online ad revenue. -
Since making the transition July 23 from
The Ann Arbor News to AnnArbor.com, ques-
tions press the publication: how well is Ann
Arbor's new news source serving the com-
munity? Could it stand to do it better than its
predecessor? And when AnnArbor.com does
get it right, will former News readers appreci-
ate it?
WHAT THE NEWS WAS NOT
The Ann Arbor News and the majority of its
readers were not the most agreeable of bedfel-
lows. The News's conservative editorial board
- which endorsed George Bush in 2000 and
2004- alienated the liberal epicenter it wrote
for. In a large way, confrontational conserva-
tism in the face of local values helped to put
the last nail in the News's coffin.
But politics aside, Ann Arbor still valued
its local daily as any medium-sized city with a
high level of community involvement would.
Karin Aarrak, an Ann Arbor resident of 35
years and a long-time News subscriber, was
disappointed by the News' closing and didn't

understand why it had to happen.
Former subscribers like Aarrak may miss
the thud of the News landing on their doorstep.
each evening. But when it comes to accessing
articles around the clock online, the replace-
ment of mlive.com, the News's former web-
site, is nothing to cry over.
AnnArbor.com currently posts articles on
mlive.com as well, which undoubtedly helped
direct old readers to the new site.
But the host site for Michigan-based Booth
Newspapers, mlive.com is an online news
sourcethatmightactuallydetractedfrompub-
lications' accessibility. It is ugly, cluttered and
confusing. Its search engine often redirects
News readers to articles from other newspa-
pers that are years old. The current mlive.com
has gotten a face-lift, but the same problems
with searching and finding articles persist.
THE FACE OF ANNARBOR.COM
It may seem suspect that the company that
owned The Ann Arbor News - Booth News-
papers' parent company, Advance Publica-
tions - would choose to stage an experiment
in Internet-only journalism. But they have,
and AnnArbor.com is it.
AnnArbor.com hasn't completely aban-
doned print. It still publishes a print version
(with the awkward masthead "Ann Arbor.
com") available to purchase Thursdays and
Sundays. But the publication's hopeful bread-
winner is its website.
According to Tony Dearing, the chief con-
tent officer of AnnArborcom, the purpose of
the site is to offer hyper-local news that will
present that news in a variety of different
mediums.
AnnArbor.com is different from the stan-
dard newspaper website, Dearing said,
because it provides readers with tools to
access news coverage in ways that traditional
journalism has shunned in the past. The site
features articles, blog posts, videos and more
from AnnArbor.com's staff, community blog-
gers and even The Michigan Daily.
As unnatural as it may seem for two com-
peting news outlets, the Daily and AnnArbor.
com have made a content sharing agreement
through which the publications will link to
selected articles from the other publication to

offer more to their web readers.
It's one more unconventional step in many
that AnnArbor.com has taken to deliver the
news. The site pushes its top local stories
every morning to those signed up to receive
the digital newsletter. Viewers can browse
posts like local concert reviews complete with
MP3 links in the site's entertainment section,.
The Deuce, or skim through a photo slideshow
of the most unique storefronts in the city.
"We want to be people's source for news
and we are as committed to news as we ever
have been," Dearing said. "But we kind of
want to use all of the tools of the digital age
and take advantage of social media to really
reflect the community and life in the commu-
nity in a way that is really. everything that's
happening in Ann Arbor - and not just news
in Ann Arbor."
Innovative content production is more
important than ever for AnnArbor.com, which
has a much smaller staff than what the News
used to boast. The site employs a full-time staff
of about 60, including 35 reporters - a drastic
decrease from the News's 316-member staff.
Rather than emulating a more traditional,
hierarchical style of layout, AnnArbor.com
features what Dearing calls a "river of news"
concept, which updates the homepage with
headlines by both staff reporters and blogcon-
tributors as they come in. Resembling Twitter
or a Facebook.com news feed, the site is fairly
easy to navigate, featuring headlines in the
center of the homepage with topics of inter-
est at both the top and right-hand side of the
page.
"One of our goals with the new layout and
just the whole site was that the site be fairly
intuitive, fairly easy to navigate, and I think
people that are comfortable with computers
and websites have not had much trouble get-
ting around our site," Dearing said. "It's pretty
simple and it's designed to be simple."
TEPID COMMUNITY RECEPTION
Since the launch in late July, residents have
perused both the website and print edition to
see what Ann Arbor's first e-newspaper has to
offer, and being about seven weeks in, opin-
ions vary about the design and content of the
site. But residents seem to be most uncertain

as to where AnnArbor.com lies on hard-hit-
ting issues.
The News was known for a fairly conserva-
tive voice, which was not always well received
in such a liberal town. AnnArbor.com's opin-
ion section is a far cry from that, consisting of
daily blog posts by staff members linking to
other publications' editorials. Whether or not
these "opinionated" posts offer a much-need-
ed liberal respite is a question that residents
like Vicki Honeyman can't yet answer.
"I don't really have a sense of its editorial
position yet," Honeyman said.
As an Ann Arbor resident for forty years
and local business owner, Honeyman was an
avid News reader and was aware of its conser-
vative tastes. But even though she often dis-
agreed with the opinion of the News, she felt
that its strong editorial voice catered to the
wide spectrum of opinions in the community.
To her, AnnArbor.com can't fully reach out to
the community until it has found its voice.
Other readers have alot lessto sayaboutthe
site because its content is catered to an online-
oriented readership. Aarrak reads the print
edition of AnnArbor.com and said that she
thinks the style of the paper is very similar to
The Ann Arbor News, but has to get used to
not receiving it on a daily basis.
She couldn't offer an opinion of the website
because of her inability to access the Internet.
"I'm waiting for my husband to set up the
computer," Aarrak said.
Aarrak falls in the 8 percent of Ann Arbor
residents who don't have online access at
home and who don't read some of their news
online, according to an estimate made my
AnnArbor.com administrators last March. It
was the other 92 percent that led Dearing and
co-executives atAnnArbor.com to believe that
the site would be successful in the web-savvy
Ann Arbor community.
"One of the reasons we did this here is
because so many of the people in Ann Arbor
are web savvy," Dearing said. "But, that being
said, we still knew there would be people who
have been traditional newspaper readers who
weren't very comfortable online and who
would nowhave to be going online to get their
news."
