Sylvia Burwell touts 
federal aid to the city 
following water crisis

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the 

U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, visited a Flint 
health center to observe firsthand 
the 
city’s 
recovery 
efforts 

Thursday.

“I came here today to spend time 

on the ground — listening, hearing 
what people are saying about the 
issues and what we are doing as a 
federal response,” Burwell said.

Burwell 
and 
Nicole 
Lurie, 

U.S. 
assistant 
secretary 
for 

preparedness and response, who 
is leading the federal response and 
recovery effort in Flint, met with 
community leaders and elected 
officials, 
including 
Gov. 
Rick 

Snyder (R). Federal officials have 
provided assistance to the city 
amist the water crisis.

The 
federal 
and 
state 

government both declared a state 

of emergency for the city of Flint 
due to toxic levels of lead in the 
water supply following a switch 
to the Flint River in April 2014. 
President Barack Obama declared 
the emergency on Jan. 16, following 
Snyder’s declaration on Jan. 12. 
The water being supplied to the 
residents and businesses of Flint is 
laced with lead due to corrosion in 
the city’s pipes from the effects of 
the Flint River water, though the 
supply has been switched back to 
Detroit water since October.

Burwell

HCHN was founded in 1982 in 
response to the medical needs 
of low-income families in Flint.

University Provost Martha Pollack, who recommended Alec Gallimore for the position of the Dean of Engineering, speaks with Regent Denise Ilitch (D) after a 
Board of Regents meeting in the Michigan Union Thursday.

Alec Gallimore to 

succeed Dave Munson 

effective in June 

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

At Thursday’s Board of Regents 

meeting, Alec D. Gallimore was 
appointed 
as 
the 
University 

of Michigan’s next Dean of 
Engineering, effective July 1, 2016 
through June 30, 2021.

“As 
a 
successful 
scholar, 

educator and administrator who 
has dedicated his entire career 
to advancing the study and 
profession of engineering, Alec D. 
Gallimore is uniquely qualified to 
lead the College of Engineering,” 
University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack said in a statement.

Gallimore 
is 
currently 
a 

tenured professor of areospace 
engineering, and the recipient of 
two named professorships: he is 
an Arthur F. Thurnau professor 
and the Richard F. and Eleanor 

Towner Professor of Engineering.

He 
will 
be 
succeeding 

Engineering Dean David Munson, 
who announced he would step 
down as dean in 2015. Munson 
began his tenure in 2006, and 
over the past 10 years has formed 
interdisciplinary 
collaborations 

with the Medical School and other 
schools, as well as brought about 
more entrepreneurship efforts. He 
has also aimed to unite students 
and faculty on North Campus 
through videos and Halloween 
parties.

Gallimore joined the University 

community 
in 
1992 
as 
an 

assistant professor in Aerospace 
Engineering. Since then, he has 
earned tenure in that department 
as well as held a joint appointment 
in the Applied Physics Program 
in 
LS&A. 
Additionally, 
from 

2005-2011 he served as associate 
dean for academic programs and 
initiatives in the Rackham School 
of Graduate Studies as well as 
associate dean for research and 
graduate education in the College 

Confirmation of 

illness, suspected to 
be norovirus, to be 
announced soon

BY ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

By Thursday afternoon, the 

number of cases of suspected 
norovirus on campus had grown 
by an additional 30 cases reported 
as 
of 
Wednesday 
according 

to Robert Winfield, executive 
director of University Health 
Services. Confirmation of whether 
the outbreak is indeed norovirus 
is expected by Friday or Monday, 
The University’s Office of Public 
Affairs said.

While the origin of the outbreak 

remains 
unknown, 
Winfield 

said most cases from earlier in 
the week could be traced back to 
South and West Quad dining halls. 
However he noted the outbreak 
may have now spread beyond the 
dining halls. 

“It appears that most (cases) 

have been identified as at South 
and West Quads, but we’ve had 
as of yesterday — and I don’t 
know (the information as of) this 
morning — cases that have been 
seen in North Quad, Baits and 
Markley,” Winfield said. “Those 
are small numbers as far as I 
know. I really don’t have numbers 
with respect to housing, this is 
just what we’ve seen in health 
services.”

Dining hall attendance seems 

to have drastically decreased over 
the past few days, as demonstrated 

by a feature in the Michigan app 
that shows how full the dining 
halls are at any given moment.

However, Winfield said now 

there is no need for students to 
be concerned about eating at the 
dining halls. All of the food present 
in South Quad on Monday was 
taken away and the area has been 
extensively cleaned, according to 
Winfield.

In an e-mail to all LSA 

department chairs, to be shared 
with faculty members Thursday 
night, 
Monika 
R. 
Dressler, 

Director, 
LSA 
Instructional 

Support 
Services, 
provided 

protocol for if a student throws up 
or becomes sick in a classroom.

Protocol 
includes, 
“Have 

someone escort the student to 
University Health Services or, if 
the student is in severe distress, 
call 911. Call LSA Instructional 
Support Services 734-615-0100 
immediately. ISS staff will call 
Plant Operations to send out a 
cleaning crew. LSA ISS and the 
Registrar’s Office will work to 
find alternate spaces for classes (if 
possible) until Building Services 
has had time to execute their 
cleaning protocol.”

In 
the 
e-mail, 
Dressler 

confirmed at least one student has 
thrown up in a classroom so far. 
Have your students leave the room 
as best as they are able.

Winfield also noted that the 

number of cases being reported at 
this time are just rough estimates, 
saying that the University has 
encouraged students to avoid 
seeking medical services unless 
absolutely necessary, to avoid 
further spread of the illness. 

Political experts 
discuss impact on 
global economy 

and security

By TIM COHN

For the Daily

Phillip Lohaus, a research 

fellow at the conservative think 
tank 
American 
Enterprise 

Institute, discussed the role 
of America in international 
leadership at the Ford School of 
Public Policy Thursday.

Lohaus, who worked as an 

analyst at the Department of 

Defense from 2006 to 2012, was 
the editor for the AEI report 
“Why American Leadership 
Still 
Matters,” 
which 
was 

authored 
by 
former 
Sen. 

Joseph Lieberman (I–Conn.) 
and former Sen. Jon Kyl (R–
Ariz.). The report advocates 
for an increase in United States 
involvement in foreign affairs, 
and the promotion of free 
enterprise principles globally.

In 
his 
opening 
address, 

Lohaus 
told 
the 
audience 

that 
U.S. 
involvement 
in 

international 
affairs 
has 

had a positive impact on the 
international 
economy 
and 

global security, and current 
patterns of disengagement have 

had troubling consequences.

“Events, since 2013, have 

highlighted just how much is 
at stake when America pulls 
back from its leadership role 
in world affairs,” Lohaus said. 
“In Europe, Russia’s president, 
Vladimir Putin, has annexed 
the Crimean Peninsula and 
conducted an undeclared war 
in Eastern Ukraine, and in the 
Middle East the ongoing Syrian 
Civil War has had a devastating 
toll in lives lost and refugees 
created and has created a space 
for the armies of the Islamic 
State to conquer key Iraqi cities 
of Ramadi and Mosul.”

not factor ties to

By MARLEE BREAKSTONE

Daily Staff Reporter

Two University of Michigan 

faculty members were introduced 
as 
possible 
appointments 
to 

Ann Arbor city commissions at 
City Council on Tuesday — but 
councilmembers said their ties to 
the University will not be a factor 
in the Council’s decision.

David Baum, assistant dean 

of Student Life and special 
counsel to the dean, is applying 
to be on the Ann Arbor Human 
Rights Commission and Karie 
Slavik, associate director of UM 
Biological Station, is interested 
in serving on the Ann Arbor 
Environmental Commission.

Baum has been a resident of 

Ann Arbor for more than 20 
years and said in an interview he 
was drawn to the city after his 
acceptance at the University. He 
graduated in 1989, completing 
undergraduate and law degrees. 
During his time in the city, 
Baum has developed ties both to 
the community and the current 
councilmembers, he said.

Baum 
and 
councilmember 

Julie Grand (D-Ward 3) are 
longtime friends and neighbors, 
and Baum attended law school 
with Grand’s husband. Grand 
said she believes Baum’s empathy 
makes him a strong candidate

Ann Arbor’s 

groundwater is center 
of talks with officials, 

activists

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Amid some public concerns 

over the safety of Ann Arbor’s 
groundwater, 
representatives 

of the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality took 

questions from local leaders 
at Washtenaw County’s Board 
of 
Commissioners 
working 

session on Thursday evening.

The 
contaminated 
plume 

of groundwater that several 
residents have raised concerns 
about — which lies beneath 
Scio 
Township 
and 
Ann 

Arbor and is slowly moving 
toward the Huron River — 
originated 
from 
Gelman 

Sciences, 
which 
improperly 

disposed of 1,4-dioxane into 
the groundwater between 1966 
and 1986.

However, 
1,4-dioxane 

has never been detected in 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
water 
supply, 

and a network of monitoring 
wells have been maintained 
by the DEQ and Gelman-
Pall 
Corporation, 
Gelman’s 

successor company as of 1992.

Public scrutiny regarding the 

Gelman Plume had been largely 
dormant for years, and was 
reignited after the Flint water 
crisis.

On Feb. 1, Ann Arbor City 

Council unanimously approved 
a resolution demanding the 
DEQ 
adopt 
more 
stringent 

cleanup standards, in response 
to calls for action from members 
of the public.

Current 
DEQ 
cleanup 

standards 
for 
dioxane 
are 

set at 85 parts per billion in 
groundwater, despite the fact 
that 
EPA 
guidelines 
state 

that dioxane carries a one in 
100,000 cancer risk at 3.5 parts 
per billion. At the plume’s most 
concentrated points, test wells 
have detected concentrations 

in excess of 1,000 parts per 
billion.

At 
Thursday’s 
meeting, 

local officials and members 
of the Washtenaw County 
Coalition 
for 
Remediation 

of Dioxane — a consortium 
of 
local 
activists 
and 

governments — put forth 
a series of complaints and 
requests to the DEQ.

CARD members Kristen 

Schweighoefer, 
Washtenaw 

County environmental health 
director, and Roger Rayle, 
chair of Scio Residents for 
Safe Water, demanded the 
state take more assertive 
legal 
action 
against 
Pall 

Corporation to compel a more 
thorough cleanup. They also 
said they wanted DEQ to 
revise its cleanup standards 
to be in line with the EPA, 
and voiced worry that a new 

northward growth of the plume 
poses an immediate threat to 
numerous residential drinking 
wells in Ann Arbor.

“How long can we really let 

this plume expand without 
taking 
aggressive 
action?” 

Rayle said.

Mike Moran, Ann Arbor 

Township 
supervisor, 

expressed frustration toward 
the 
state 
government 
for 

failing to address the issue, 
adding that he was actively 
exploring turning the plume 
into a superfund site that would 
prompt 
EPA 
intervention. 

Superfunds are sites targeted 
by the agency for cleanup.

“Simply stated, I have lost 

my confidence in the state of 
Michigan to do what needs 
to be done to bring this to a 
satisfactory conclusion,” Moran 
said.

In response, Bob Wagner, 

chief of the DEQ Remediation 

and Redevelopment Division, 
acknowledged the importance 
of the group’s concerns and said 
the DEQ was acting on them. 
He added, however, that he is 
operating under court-imposed 
constraints limiting what the 
Gelman-Pall Corporation can 
be compelled to comply with.

“We’re not in a situation 

where groundwater restoration 
is going to happen; we are in 
a risk management situation” 
said Wagner.

Wagner also said the state’s 

dioxane 
safety 
standards 

would 
be 
revised 
soon, 

though 
he 
acknowledged 

that previous deadlines for 
revision had been missed due 
to unforeseen complications in 
the department’s calculations.

“While it has taken us some 

time, and I’ll be the first to say 
that we didn’t hit our projected 
end date, we are still working 
on it, we are working on it every 

day, every weekend. This will 
get done,” Wagner said.

Yousef Rabhi (D), county 

vice chair of the Board of 
Commissioners, 
criticized 

Wagner for what he viewed as 
DEQ’s inadequate answers. He 
also accused the department 
of not being beholden to public 
interests.

“Frankly, if you guys give 

me a timeline, I’m just as much 
going to assume you’re not 
going to get it done in 30 years,” 
Rabhi said to Wagner. “Your 
timelines have no credibility 
with me because you’ve broken 
my trust multiple times.”

“What am I going to tell my 

constituents, 
‘Sorry, 
you’re 

never going to get that water 
cleaned up?’ That’s what I 
heard,” continued Rabhi. “I am 
going to do everything in my 
power to fight that, and to make 
sure the DEQ must clean up this 
environmental catastrophe.

be divided equally amongst HCHN 
and the Genesee Health System.

Social workers at HCHN are 

helping Flint children and adults 
cope with emotional trauma from 
the crisis. Part of the $250,000 
going toward HCHN will address 
these behavioral issues, as well as 
another $250,000 grant given to 
the Genesee Health System.

“We are … including behavioral 

health issues. It will be important 
both to the children and to the 
community as well,” Burwell said.

Burwell was met with many 

questions regarding plans for future 
funding toward the Flint recovery 
during her visit. While Burwell 
couldn’t give exact numbers, the 
department released a statement 
on a proposed major expansion of 
Medicaid coverage for the children 
and pregnant women of Flint. This 
expansion would cover blood-lead 
level monitoring, behavioral health 
services, nutritional support and 
targeted case management.

“I don’t 
think 
the 
money 

numbers perfectly reflect all that 
the federal government is doing 
at this point. Medicare expansion 
will be a large part of the effort,” 
Burwell said. “Our objective is 
the community and the problem. 
When we get up every day we look 
at the charts, and we look at the 
progress of the two fundamental 
things we are trying to do.”

According 
to 
Burwell, 
the 

federal government hopes to reach 
the point where clean and safe 
water is accessible to every citizen 
of Flint both in the short and long 
term. The government is also 
working to discern the cause of the 
lead contamination and how best 
to mitigate it.

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D–Flint), 

who attended the event, met 
with Burwell and her team to 
address localized plans and assess 
the effectiveness of the federal 
government’s aid in Flint.

“The 
president 
responded 

almost immediately. He asked 
the director of a federal agency 
to take the lead, which is a big 
commitment,” Kildee said. “This 
isn’t about anything but trying to 
get solutions for the people of Flint 
and spending time with citizens 
and community leaders. I think 
they really felt that they had a 
listening ear today.”

During her visit, Burwell also 

addressed the general outline of 
a plan coordinated for everyone 
involved in Flint’s recovery. The 
federal government has put 70 
people in Flint to help maintain 
a coordinated response between 
Flint and all the groups involved in 
its relief, she said.

“I think what is fair to say is that 

we are working very hard … I think 
we can always be more coordinated 
and do better and more,” Burwell 
said. “I think most people are 
agreeing of the basic plan of 
distributing water and figuring out 
the interim steps… There is a basic 
agreement on those as being the 
general steps we need to take.”

of Engineering.

According to a press release, his 

research interests include electric 
propulsion, plasma diagnostics, 
space plasma simulation, electrode 
physics 
and 
nano-particle 

energetics. In 1992, he created 
the Plasmadynamics and Electric 
Propulsion Laboratory, which has 
become a successful laboratory 
with 50 graduate alumnae incuding 
36 Ph.D and 14 Master’s alumni.

His achievements have been 

recognized with several academic 
awards, including the 2002 Aerospace 
Engineering Award for Outstanding 
accomplishments. In 2005, he was 
awarded the University’s Harold R. 
Johnson Diversity Service Award 
as well as the Air Force Decoration 
for Meritorious Civilian Service. 
Gallimore’s contributions to the Air 
Force earned him a spot on the U.S. 
Air Force Scientific Advisory Board 
from 2001-2005.

Gallimore received his B.S. in 

aeronautical engineering in 1986 
from 
Rensselaer 
Polytechnic 

Institute, later receiving his M.A. 
and Ph.D. degrees in aerospace 
engineering from Princeton in 1988 
and 1992.

“I am confident that he brings 

the 
experience, 
energy, 
and 

demonstrated leadership to guide 
the college to greater visibility as a 
true exemplar of innovation, thus 
placing it in the highest echelon of 
institutions worldwide,” Pollack 
said.

to serve on the Human Rights 
Commission.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Human 

Rights Commission, previously 
called the Human Relations 
Commission, was created by 
City Council in 1957 under 
Mayor Sam Eldersveld. The 
commission is comprised of 
nine 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents, 

appointed by the mayor and City 
Council, who are responsible 
for 
dealing 
with 
issues 

pertaining to discrimination in 
employment, housing and public 
accommodations. 
According 

to the commission’s mission 
statement, “(The commission) 
serves as a watchdog to protect 
the human and civil rights of the 
people of Ann Arbor.”

Grand said she thought Baum’s 

personality would make him well 
suited for this position, noting 
that the role has little to do with 
his University experience.

“He’s incredibly smart and 

just a lovely person,” Grand said. 
“He’s the type of person that you 
want to see serving the city to 
some capacity.”

For Grand, Baum’s University 

connection 
does 
not 
affect 

his status as an Ann Arbor 
resident. She said the city and 
the University are essentially 
separate entities.

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman 
(D–Ward 
3) 
has 

known Baum since elementary 
school, when Baum was his his 
third and fourth grade baseball 
coach, and said he thinks he 
would be a good addition to the 
Human Rights Commission.

“His reputation as a dean of the 

Law School is as a fair and honest 
educator 
and 
administrator,” 

Ackerman said.

Baum said he was contacted 

directly by Mayor Christopher 
Taylor and asked to apply for 
this position. Taylor was a law 
student at the University when 
Baum began his career as an 
administrator.

“We’ve 
been 
friends 
and 

colleagues really for about the 
last 15 years, so I think he thought 
of me based on his experiences 
with me as somebody who might 
be willing and interested,” Baum 
said.

In his application for the 

position, Baum said he believed 
he would be a good fit for the 

Human 
Rights 
Commission 

because of his values.

“I believe strongly in the 

inherent 
worth 
and 
dignity 

of 
every 
person, 
and 
also 

that our society should strive 
constantly to eliminate wrongful 
discrimination,” Baum wrote. 
“I believe I would contribute 
positively to the community by 
serving on the AAHRC.”

Additionally, 
Baum 
said 

his tenure on the Educational 
Environment Committee at the 
Law School, during which he 
worked with students, faculty 
and administrators to promote 
diversity, equity and inclusion, 
will help him in his new role with 
the city.

“I, at the Law School, have 

been involved for years working 
with students who are minorities 
— racial minorities, gay and 
lesbian or disabled students 
amongst others,” Baum said.

“My experiences will help 

provide me with some very 
helpful context with which to 
approach my work on the Ann 
Arbor Human Rights Council,” 
he added.

This has resulted in there being 
no reliable way of knowing for 
sure what percentage of those 
affected are coming in and 
what percentage are not seeking 
medical help.

“Now that the word is out, 

which is, ‘it’s going around’ and 
‘don’t come in unless you need 
to,’ we really have no good way 
of grasping the total number,” 
Winfield said. “From that, we can 
say it is continuing, but we don’t 
know whether it’s continuing 
up, flattening out or starting 
to drop down, and we won’t be 
able to find that out from these 
numbers.”

The best treatment, he added, 

depends on how sick a student is.

 “We encourage people to 

start with ice chips if they’ve 
been vomiting, and then see if 
they can tolerate sips of water,” 
he said.

Once a student can drink 

water, doctors suggest drinking 
liquids such as Gatorade to 
rehydrate. Winfield said it could 
take anywhere between a couple 
of hours up to three days for 
someone to start feeling better.

Over the past few days students 

have expressed concerns about 
the University’s spread of the 
notification about the virus 
and ongoing efforts related to 
academic accomodations for sick 
students.

Engineering freshman Steven 

McPherson, also a resident of 
South Quad, said he would have 
prefered to be made aware of the 
illness sooner.

“ I really would have liked a 

notification e-mail earlier than 
two days after people started 
throwing 
up 
everywhere,” 

McPherson said.

Both McPherson and LSA 

freshman Cameron Misko said 
they found out about the illness 
from social media, particularly 
Yik Yak, and word of mouth.

Winfield said there were 

initial doubts about what was 
happening that justified the 
delay.

“There’s something that seems 

it’s in common with South Quad 
and West Quad dining services, 
but we have cases where we can’t 
make that connection,” Winfield 
said. “Those foods are available 
to us for trying to identify source 
of illness, but they are gone from 
the service of food.”

“I really wasn’t sure what 

was going on at first and 
perhaps 
overly 
cautious 
in 

getting out a communication 
before I understood what was 
going on,” Winfield said. “I was 
hesitant to communicate before 
I had a better sense of what was 
happening.”

Kim 
Broekhuizen, 
public 

affairs 
and 
media 
relations 

representative for Public Affairs, 
highlighted in an e-mail to 
the Daily that the University 
e-mail to students specified that 
students who were affected 
by the illness should isolate 
themselves 
until 
they 
are 

without symptoms for 48 hours.

The Office of the Provost has 

also released an e-mail to deans, 
encouraging faculty members 
to be flexible with regard to 
accommodating students who 
report being ill and would be 
unable to attend class, take 
exams or turn in assignments, 
Broekhuizen said.

“We are still waiting for test 

results 
to 
confirm 
whether 

the 
outbreak 
is 
norovirus,” 

Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“That 

information 
is 
expected 

tomorrow afternoon or Monday.”

Professors of Stats 250, the 

most 
enrolled-in 
course 
on 

campus, 
released 
an 
e-mail 

Thursday 
specifying 
special 

midterm accommodations for 
students who are sick or who 
feel they may be sick. Reports 
of similar e-mails have been 
confirmed in various University 
classes.

“If you have experienced 

the symptoms that have been 
reported ... in the past few days 
and have not felt well for two 
days past the experience of these 
symptoms, do not attend Exam 
1 this evening,” the e-mail read. 
“We do not want you to have to 
take the exam while ill and do 
not want to expose students who 
would not otherwise be exposed 
to this illness.”

Amir Baghdadchi, director of 

communications for University 
Housing, said the most crucial 
thing sick students can do is 
isolate themselves from others.

“We have to remember that 

illnesses like this are extremely 
contagious,” Baghdadchi said. 
“We’re encouraging students 
to stay in their rooms and avoid 
going to classes. If you want to 
get well, until 48 hours after you 
feel those symptoms, you should 
stay in your room.”

Baghdadchi 
acknowledged 

that many students, especially 
those sick, are concerned about 
getting their meals.

“Students are using Feel-

better meals, and what the 
students sick can do, is they can 
actually work with a friend to 
order that meal and then have 
that friend deliver it for them,” 
Baghdadchi said. “We’re making 
this as available as we can for 
all the students who have meal 
plans who live in the halls.”

For students who are not 

affected, 
Baghdadchi 
agreed 

with Winfield and said there is 
little reason to hesitate going to 
the dining halls.

“Those who aren’t ill will find 

when they go to the dining halls 
that we have stepped up cleaning 
procedures across our system, 
in all residence halls and in all 
dining centers,” Baghdadchi said. 
“We are, across all residence hall 
bathrooms and all dining halls, 
using a higher level protocol for 
cleaning. Extra measures are 
being taken to keep it safe.”

There are indicators that this 

is not a foodborne illness but a 
viral-based illness, Baghdadchi 
added.

“We are using this special 

higher-level protocol, where we 
use cleaning agents approved 
by the federal government that 
targets specifically norovirus,” 
Baghdadchi said. “The intensity 
of cleaning is much greater and 
it’s actually designed to target 
this kind of outbreak.”

Jeff Bogos, kitchen manager 

at Au Bon Pain said the staff at 
Au Bon Pain has been working 
to maintain cleaning procedures 
and has brought in extra hand 
sanitation.

“We don’t want that to spread 

any worse than it already has,” 
Bogos said.

Because produce at Au Bon 

Pain is ordered daily, Bogos said 
the restaurant has been ordering 
extra food to keep up with the 
high demands.

“We’re up probably 40 to 50 

percent (in sales),” Bogos said. 
“The feedback from the students 
is they don’t want to eat (at South 
Quad) and I don’t blame them.”

Sick 
students 
have 
also 

complained 
about 
having 

difficulty getting in contact with 
their professors and getting 
special 
accommodations, 

particularly for midterms.

“The 
University 
is 

communicating all across faculty 
and through the Record and 
many channels so that all faculty 
and instructors know that this is 
going on on campus, and this is 
what students are dealing with,” 
Baghdadchi said.

LSA freshman Kyra Jamison 

lives in West Quad and said she 
knows two people who have 
been affected by the suspected 
norovirus.

“One of them went to UHS,” 

Jamison said, adding she later 
decided to go home to Sterling 
Heights to recover. “The other 
one said she didn’t want to walk 
there so she’s staying in her room 
all day.”

Misko who lives in South 

Quad, said the majority of his hall 
has been experiencing telltale 
symptoms of the norovirus.

“A lot of friends from my hall 

(got sick),” Misko said. “One of 
them did (go to UHS), but most 
of the other ones are just trying 
to handle it on their own. They 
are isolating themselves.”

For students who have not 

yet caught the illness, yet live 
with roommates who are sick, 
Misko said from what he has 
seen, many people are trying 
to 
avoid 
their 
roommates. 

However, 
considering 
close 

quarters, Misko noted it seemed 
impossible to avoid the illness 
completely.

Freshman 
Javin 
Etchison, 

who studies exercise science at 
Washtenaw Community College 
and works at South Quad dining 
hall, said the dining hall has been 
making adjustments based on 
the recent outbreak.

“We’re still preparing the 

same food, just a little more 
cautiously, a lot more washing 
hands, 
changing 
gloves,” 

Etchison 
said. 
“Instead 
of 

students being able to grab the 
food themselves, we serve the 
food to them, so they can’t touch 
food and put it back.”

Leadership 
Still 
Matters,” 

Lohaus said the collaborators on 
the report identified three pillars 
of American engagement in the 
world, which he stated were 
military security, economics and 
human freedom. 

Former 
ambassadors 
and 

current 
Ford 
School 
Profs. 

Richard Boucher and Melvyn 
Levitsky 
also 
joined 
the 

discussion panel.

Boucher, 
a 
former 
U.S. 

Ambassador 
to 
Cyprus, 

responded to Lohaus, saying he 
believed the report relied too 
heavily on platitudes. 

“It 
uses 
phrases 
like 

‘proactive,’ 
‘persistent’ 
and 

‘powerful’ — which, frankly to 
most of the world sounds like 
‘pushy,’ ‘preachy’ and ‘punchy,’ ” 
Boucher said.

He urged that the government 

should instead take a more active 
role in diplomacy rather than 
military confrontation, and use 
the military as a means of dealing 
in international affairs. In regard 
to the role of the military, he 
warned, “If you are a hammer, 
then everything you see becomes 
a nail.”

Levitsky, former ambassador 

to Brazil, praised the AEI report, 
which he said was reminiscent 
of President Barack Obama’s 
2015 report on national security 
strategy. 

Levitsky’s remarks focused 

on 
American 
commitment 

to 
international 
human 

rights. Speaking to American 
diplomatic successes in that 
arena, he cited the pressure 
that former Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger placed on USSR 
ministers during World War II, 
which he said then led to the 
release of roughly 120,000 Soviet 
Jews from prisons and gulags. 

“One of the things that was 

interesting about the (Edward) 
Snowden WikiLeaks was that 
many (of the released documents) 
were international cables, reports 
that showed how much America 
was doing in quiet diplomacy in 
a number of countries,” he said. 
“We were trying to convince 
several governments, that we 
had relationships with, to treat 
the oppositions better, to not jail 
them, and to release those who 
were jailed.”

Public Policy senior Grace 

Lutfy, who helped organize the 
event, said after the event that 
she thought the discussion was a 
success.

“We had a really good turnout 

across all generations, which 
was really nice to see,” Lutfy 
said. “I thought the panelists 
were fabulous; they were very 
knowledgeable about the issues, 
and the question-and-answer 
section really brought out their 
strengths on the subjects.”

I 

was only 50 pages or so into 
“The Turner House,” a 2015 
National 

Book 
Award 

finalist, when I 
thought to myself 
that the author, 
Angela Flournoy, 
must have been 
from Detroit.

I was wrong.
A story about 

a living but aging 
matriarch, Viola; 
a dead patriarch, 
Francis; and their 
13 children, “The Turner House” is 
set in Detroit and details the fam-
ily’s current struggles living in the 
city as well as the history of how 
Francis and Viola arrived in Michi-
gan to start their family.

The book is mainly focused on 

two characters: Cha Cha, Fran-
cis and Viola’s oldest child, who 
is experiencing somewhat of a 
mental breakdown and Lelah, 
the youngest child, who suffers 
from gambling addiction, which 
takes her through several twists 
and turns with her family and old 
acquaintances.

The plotline itself is worth giv-

ing the book a read; it delves deep 
into the significance and strength 
of family relationships, and had 
me thinking how my divorced par-
ents’ families have stuck together 
through difficult times. It’s the 
setting, though, that gives the 
book its veracity. Nearly every 
detail rang true: the description of 
the casinos, streets and houses, for 
example. The discussions of white 
flight 
and 
deindustrialization 

were on point. Clearly, Flournoy 
has a unique, intimate knowledge 
of Detroit.

But again, Flournoy is not from 

Detroit. Though her father grew up 
in Detroit and she visited once or 
twice a year growing up, she’s from 
Los Angeles, lived in Iowa and now 
lives in Brooklyn.

So how exactly did she gain this 

insight? I spoke with her on the 
phone last week to find out.

“I read a lot of books,” Flournoy 

explained. “Mostly nonfiction, sort 
of urban histories or histories sort 

of like early industrialization in 
Detroit and then population change 
in Detroit. And then I also read 
some oral histories.”

“But also, I watched movies and 

YouTube videos and just random 
things. One of the most useful 
things actually was Google Maps, 
particularly the street view because 
all those photos in street view are 
dated, so you know exactly what 
a place looked like, say in 2009, 
which was really useful.”

I noted one crucial part of 

Flournoy’s 
research 
that 
was 

absent: She did not interview any 
Detroiters to gain an understand-
ing of the city at the most individual 
level. But, Flournoy made a compel-
ling point as to why it can actually 
be more harmful than helpful when 
your knowledge of a place becomes 
too vast.

“When you’re not from a city, 

there’s a way that you can sort 
of channel information without 
the burden of feeling like every 
little detail needs to be included,” 
Flournoy told me. “So I’m from LA, 
but I have not successfully written 
anything set in LA because the set-
ting always feels insufficient when 
I write it. So that’s because my 
knowledge of the city is so sort of 
detailed that it’s hard to figure out 
what information to prioritize and 
help the reader feel like they get an 
understanding of the place. And so 
in Detroit, I had a background of 
the city, but I wasn’t from the city, 
so then when I did research, I could 
really choose what details about 
the city were important to my char-
acters versus what was important 
personally to me, which I think is 
the challenge.”

And according to her, writing as an 

outsider about Detroit has paid off.

“The response has been over-

whelmingly positive, and it’s been 
humbling because I really wanted 
to do the city justice and I wanted 
to really empathize with people 
who lived there,” she said. “But I 
don’t think I paint a rosy picture.”

I wrote a column in January 

touching on the influence and abil-
ity of outsiders to come into Detroit 
and monetize its culture. Clearly, 
Shinola (the company I discussed) 

and Flournoy’s book are very differ-
ent things, but it had me question-
ing once again, both through fiction 
and nonfiction, who should be tell-
ing Detroit’s story. I think if I was 
asked a month ago who was best 
suited to do so (not that outsiders 
haven’t tried before), I would have 
said hands-down a native Detroiter.

After 
reading 
“The 
Turner 

House” and speaking with Flourn-
oy, my views have certainly shifted. 
Anyone, even if he or she isn’t from 
the city, can write about Detroit — 
or any place, for that matter — hon-
estly and effectively, but there is a 
prerequisite: the need to be open 
and honest about the subject you’re 
writing about.

When discussing this point, 

Flournoy recited a quote by an 
author who has influenced her writ-
ing greatly, Zora Neale Hurston: 
“Mouths don’t empty themselves 
unless the ears are sympathetic and 
knowing.”

“The 
reason 
why 
that 
line 

was important for this book was 
because I wasn’t from the place,” 
she explained. “I had to do the work 
of trying to be sympathetic and the 
knowing part was the research. The 
sympathetic part was just as impor-
tant, or rather maybe empathetic. I 
really thought it was important to 
try to be fair, but not be judgmen-
tal as far as various characters and 
their relationship to place and also 
their history in the place. I think 
if the book has succeeded on a set-
ting level, it’s because I really tried 
to learn first and try to synthesize 
that into fiction second.”

For that reason — to confront 

difficult truths that make up the 
history of Detroit — it was obvious 
to me from our conversation that 
Flournoy has a deep affection for 
Detroit. 

So I asked the natural question: 

“Have you thought about moving to 
Detroit?”

“I don’t love a Midwestern win-

ter,” she replied.

Well, I tried. At least she told a 

story worth telling and did so with 
sympathetic and knowing ears.

M

ost mornings, I am awoken by the 
shrill ring of my alarm clock alert-
ing me that it is time to stumble out 

of bed and sleepily begin my day — an unset-
tling tactic, but also effective. However, this 
particular Wednesday morning, I was awoken 
by something much more troubling. While I 
grabbed my phone to turn off my alarm, I 
opened a picture message that caused my jaw 
to rapidly drop in disbelief. When my friend 
Meg thrust open her door to go to the bath-
room, she was immediately confronted with 
the remnants of someone’s vomit splattered 
across the dimly lit hallway of West Quad. 
Of course, she had to document the moment, 
along with the caption, “Oh, hell no.”

For something that had once been mere 

distant chatter, the norovirus outbreak 
entered our lives in a manner similar to the 
suddenness with which it strikes its victims. 
Eating pre-packaged oatmeal safe in the con-
fines of my dorm room, I grew more and more 
fearful as the reports of widespread vomit-
ing accumulated — especially on Yik Yak, the 
perfect breeding ground for fear-mongering 
alarmists.

As the day wore on, I 

began to feel like I was 
starring in some sort of 
twisted quarantine-style 
horror film. I had already 
been wary of dining halls 
in the past, and the virus’s 
suspected connection to 
South Quad Dining Hall 
completely destroyed my 
appetite for any food that 
had been set out in the 
vicinity of potentially ill 
students. I didn’t take 
the buses due to reports 
of people getting sick on the already jam-
packed transportation. The Ross Academic 
Center was closed early to be deep cleaned. 
A friend that had been perfectly healthy 
at lunchtime was puking by the afternoon. 
Despite how terrible the events occurring 
are, I heard multiple people make remarks 
that the mass hysteria was sort of “entertain-
ing” and “exciting.”

Why is it that humans tend to lose all sense 

of rationality when outbreaks occur, and 
seem to delight in doing so?

Though the term “contagion” is usually 

used to refer to the spread of illness, the more 
specific phrase “social contagion” refers to 
the idea that moods and thoughts can become 
contagious in large group settings. As soon 
as individuals enter into a group, they begin 
to feel that they are both “anonymous and 
invincible” — a feeling accelerated today by 
the influx of social media apps and online 
messaging sites available. People say what-
ever they want, with no fear of the repercus-
sions because they seemingly have the entire 
group on their side. Then the “contagion” 
occurs, and the members of the group fall 
susceptible to extreme suggestibility. High 
on emotion and fear, they engage in a period 
of extreme interaction, finely attuned to the 
stress that other group members face.

An “us against them” mentality is quickly 

created: students versus norovirus, or maybe 
even more so, students against the admin-
istration’s handling of the norovirus. This 
type of contagion was prevalent during such 
events as the French Revolution, the Cold 

War and the Ebola outbreak, and still exists 
today… right in the middle of campus.

However, these feelings of heightened 

fear can actually weaken one’s immune sys-
tem rather than protect it. Worrying will 
not necessarily let germs into the body, but 
worrying increases the level of cortisol in 
one’s immune system, which will in turn 
reduce the antibodies that help fight infec-
tion. When one experiences a time of pro-
longed stress, his or her body needs white 
blood cells, but cortisol will continue to 
suppress these blood cells. A weak immune 
system, without the necessary cells need-
ed for protection, is much more likely to 
become infected.

As I sat in West Quad realizing I was still 

healthy and unaffected by the virus, the 
humor behind my earlier hysterics rapidly 
set in. With my friends, it was so easy to get 
all wrapped up in the frenzy and pretend 
that we were all inevitably going to con-
tract the sickness and go down in flames. 
But now, by myself, I realized that I was 
simply falling victim to the crowd mental-
ity. With something like a sickness, this 

type of social contagion is a 
little more benign. But when 
a crowd gathers about ideas 
dealing with important soci-
etal issues, this behavior can 
quickly become insidious. 
How many times have you 
started believing something 
just because those around 
you said it was true?

As I’m writing this, the 

sun is shining brightly from 
a sky unblemished by clouds, 
the temperature is warm 
and two more of my friends 

spent their nights hunched over the toilet, 
victims of the norovirus. Yet, I’m OK.

In this situation, just as much as any 

situation, it’s extremely important to main-
tain a calm exterior and not let oneself get 
wrapped up into the craziness. I’m choos-
ing to go about my routine as normal, with 
a little extra hand-washing thrown in of 
course, and calmly acknowledging the extra 
precautions the University has instituted to 
keep students safe and housecleaners bran-
dishing disinfectants and face masks. Chief 
Health Officer Robert Winfield sent out an 
e-mail Feb. 17 reminding students to wash 
their hands frequently and isolate them-
selves for at least 48 hours after symptoms 
subside.

I can never predict what the future may 

bring. I’m sure that as the number of days 
remaining until Spring Break continues to 
dwindle, the sick toll will only rise. I myself 
have a very real chance of getting sick. Yet, 
unless I actually do, I’m going to actively try 
to reduce my own contribution to all of nor-
ovirus’ hype. Norovirus, in all of its grimy 
glory, is extremely unpleasant and worthy of 
discussion, but soon it will pass and students 
will find a new cause or issue to rally around. 
Students will begin to return to classes, vomit 
remnants will be scrubbed from the halls and 
one day — one fateful day — the South Quad 
dining hall will be restored to its former 
glory.

Life in the time of norovirus

O

n Feb. 6, I attended the 
University of Michigan’s 
first tri-campus summit at 

the UM-Flint campus, where I had 
the opportunity to meet inspiring, 
engaged students from all three 
campuses. I heard the stories of 
students from Dearborn and Flint 
who do so much admirable work 
toward social justice and equity in 
their communities — those of whom 
I wouldn’t have been able to know 
about otherwise. In particular, I met 
students from the Flint campus who 
not only are committed to respond-
ing to their city’s water crisis, but 
are living it every day. Unlike many 
of us in Ann Arbor — no matter how 
much we think we know or want to 
help in this situation — these stu-
dents have the experience of going 
to university while in the midst of 
one of the most public urban crises 
in the United States.

For more than two years, Flint, 

Mich., has been on the receiving 
end of state-sanctioned violence. 
The city of about 100,000 people 
is about 57-percent Black/African 
American, and has been dealing 
with lead-laden water since the for-
mer emergency manager, Darnell 
Earley, decided to switch the water 
infrastructure from the Detroit 
supply to the Flint River. As many 
of us know by now, this had dire 
consequences: The chemistry of the 
river water proved corrosive almost 
immediately 
after 
the 
switch 

occurred, exposing lead in many 
of the pipes carrying the water — a 
problem that continued even after 
the supply was switched back to 
Detroit in October because of the 
corrosion. Flint residents started 
reporting dirty, smelly water and 
health impacts (rashes, hair loss, 
breathing problems, burning eyes, 
etc.) in the first months after the 
switch. This was in April 2014 — 
almost two years ago. Since then 
nearly a dozen people in Flint have 
died of Legionnaires’ disease (posi-
tively correlated with lead expo-
sure), all of Flint’s children are 
being treated as though they were 
exposed to unreasonably high lev-
els of lead, the city is under a state 
of emergency and communities 
are feeling the impact of this cri-
sis. While community organizers 
and others in the Flint community 

resist the water crisis by supporting 
each other and finding ways to care 
for themselves, Gov. Rick Snyder 
and others in the state government 
quietly talk about reactionary solu-
tions.

The problem I and so many oth-

ers see here is that the emergency 
management that led to this prob-
lem in Flint is bound to the poli-
tics of race and class. Michigan’s 
current administration sought to 
— and continues to seek — ways 
to restrict democracy in Michi-
gan’s urban centers. Since most 
white people left these centers in 
the decades following World War 
II, the cities — including Detroit, 
Flint, Saginaw, Pontiac and Ben-
ton Harbor — who’ve experienced 
emergency management have been 
home to majorities of people of 
color. These are people who vote 
for their officials, like every other 
community in the United States, 
but are then are told by the state 
that they are not fit to choose their 
leaders. Would this happen in 
“white” cities? I severely doubt it.

As a non-Black person of color, 

I write this article in solidarity 
with those in Flint who are criti-
cally resisting abuse in the form 
of water poisoning, emergency 
management and downright negli-
gence — I’m close to calling it “stu-
pidity” — on the part of Snyder and 
his administration. As a brown 
Middle Easterner, I see the state 
violence in Flint tied to the impe-
rial colonialism that is tied to the 
history of almost every person of 
color in our society. I can’t be the 
first to find similarities between 
U.S. involvement in the Middle 
East and the politics of racial 
domination within our nation. In 
1953, when U.S. and British forces 
initiated a coup d’état to oust Ira-
nian Prime Minister Mohammad 
Mosaddegh in the name of petro-
leum interests, they sent my fam-
ily’s country down a road that led 
to extreme Islamist control. Iran, 
once a close ally to the United 
States, finds itself always serving 
Western interests. Iran, once a 
nation where human rights were 
practiced daily, has become a place 
where those who are suspected of 
being gay or of political subver-
sion are routinely killed. Really, 

the white “West” has determined 
the course of Middle Eastern poli-
tics and economics by meddling 
in ways that are completely self-
serving; this is why I say we still 
live in colonial times. And the 
psyche of colonization there works 
in the same ways here. When the 
white governor of a state effec-
tively replaces the elected offi-
cials of Black-majority cities, we 
— Black and non-Black people of 
color — call out racial domination. 
When these emergency managers 
make decisions that lead to the 
wholesale poising of urban popu-
lations, we raise our voices against 
imperial colonialism. And when 
the same government continues 
charging water bills to those with 
tainted water — those whose well-
being has been jeopardized by vio-
lent government practices — we 
see very clearly how unrelenting 
oppression can be.

I want to highlight that we 

people of color share common his-
tories, and as much as the world 
tries to divide us — telling us that 
we are too dissimilar to hold a 
conversation, let alone struggle 
together or love one another — 
that history cannot be erased. 
 

When the students I met at UM-
Flint described their experiences, 
and those of others in their com-
munity, I understood where they 
were coming from, at least in part. 
Though I’m wary of co-opting 
racial/ethnic struggles as my own, 
I affirm that our oppressions are 
linked. Not only that, I affirm that 
our resistance as well as prosper-
ity are tied to each other’s as well. 
 

If we are to overcome racism (or 
the “imperialist-white suprem-
acist-capitalist-patriarchy”) 
we 

must stand in solidarity with each 
other. I attest that it’s in our best 
interest as non-Black people of 
color to find points of solidarity 
and work in alliance with Black 
communities as we all carve paths 
in life and work toward mutual 
liberation.

In praise of SWMRS

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

On the rare occasion that I 

actually did the reading for my 
Women’s Studies class, I read 
something interesting about punk. 
In the context of feminism, punk 
is more significant than you might 
think. According to Milestone and 
Meyer (or to anyone capable of 
observation), before punk, the only 
involvement girls had in music 
was as members of the audience. 
If women ever did make it in the 
music industry, they made it in 
wholesome pop, never provocative 
rock. Once punk came along, how-
ever, gender relations in the music 
industry 
completely 
changed. 

Punk disrupted all preconceived 
stereotypes — it inspired youth 
cultures, it lacked the manufac-
tured nature of the music industry 
— its origins were underground. 
As a result of this organic music, 
according to my Women’s Stud-
ies reading, women were able to 
express anger. Yay.

Now, obviously it’s hard for us, 

in 2016, to really see the profound 
effects of punk, but they’re there. 
The problem is the lack of OG punk 
bands existing today, which led 
me to wonder if any modern band 
could really reflect the same sound 
and eventual change as past music.

The issue I encountered as I 

pondered is that no band is real-
ly pure punk. Green Day’s Billie 
Joe Armstrong has expressed 
frustration in this dilemma — 
most modern bands are slapped 
with 
the 
label 
“pop-punk” 

which, even if this label isn’t 
necessarily accurate, constricts 
bands to a certain image, effec-

tively diluting their potential 
punk persona.

I’m sure there are bonafide punk 

bands out there, but there’s really 
only one new-age punk band that 
came to mind: SWMRS. Originally 
known as Emily’s Army, SWMRS 
is a four-piece garage-rock/punk 
band from Oakland, CA. I first 
stumbled upon the band a year ago 
when I saw Green Day perform at 
the House of Blues Cleveland — 
my position pressed against the 
barricade to the stage enabled me 
to have an excellent view of Bil-
lie Joe’s son, Joey, standing back-
stage. Now here’s the thing — Joey 
is quite attractive, so after the 
show I was like, yeah, let’s google 
Joey. When I googled Joey, I found 
his band. The problem was that 
SWMRS had no music under its 
current name until now. With the 
album set to be released on Febru-
ary 12th, Rolling Stone released the 
single “Drive North” early and it’s 
fucking incredible.

The entire album is clearly 

garage-rock, but there are com-
plex and flagrant punk under-
tones that give SWMRS a unique 
edge. They aren’t just any old rock 
band — they’re young, they’re bold 
and they encapsulate a new sound 
— a new punk sound. Describ-
ing their genre as “Hawaiianage” 
and showing a Facebook interest 
in feminism, their album reflects 
everything they claim to be.

“Uncool,” the same name of 

their self-run record label, is the 
epitome of SWMRS. The song 
is angsty, punk, Californian and 
accessible, despite being so dif-
ferent from any other music out 
there. All of these elements shine 
through on each of the 12 tracks 

on the record, but in entirely dif-
ferent ways. For example, “Miley” 
is angsty yet simple to let the lyrics 
stand-out. An ode to Miley Cyrus, 
SWMRS sing their praise for the 
“punk-rock queen.” While songs 
like “Drive North” and “Harry 
Dean” are the most traditional 
punk on the album, “Silver Bul-
let” and “Hannah” are more mel-
low, “I’m going to drive from LA to 
San Francisco in my convertible” 
tunes. Personally, my favorites are 
“Miss Yer Kiss” and “Turn Up,” 
but truthfully that’s not saying 
much because I love every song on 
this album. “Miss Yer Kiss” is great 
though because the solid beat and 
unique rhythm counter most of the 
fast-paced songs comprising the 
album — “Turn Up” is just a jam.

I feel as if I could go on for end-

less paragraphs about how incredi-
ble SWMRS and their debut album 
is, but for your sake and mine, I’ll 
quit my digression. Essentially, 
SWMRS is about to blow up. Their 
massive headlining US tour kicks 
off on February 12th, they just put 
on a music festival (“Uncool Fest”) 
and their record label is still a thing. 
This, in addition to appearances in 
magazines like Rolling Stone and 
Alternative Press, is foretelling 
of what’s to come, especially con-
sidering their debut album hasn’t 
even been officially released.

My message to you: listen to 

SWMRS. Love SWMRS or at 
the very least pretend to love 
SWMRS, because at the rate 
they’re going they could very 
easily be the next Nirvana meets 
Green Day meets something more 
tropical and you’re going to want 
to say you knew them when they 
were rookies.

ALBUM REVIEW
‘Pablo’ illustrates 
the life of Kanye

Yeezy’s career-
defining latest 
shows us exactly 
why we need him 

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

In 2002, Kanye West totaled 

his Lexus and almost died in a 
car accident. Fortunately for 
all of us, he 
survived, had 
his 
mouth 

sewn up and 
continued 
to 

work through 
the wire. The 
accident is an 
often-over-
looked catalyst 
for his career, 
and there’s no guarantee that 
we would be hearing the same 
Kanye West today had he not 
almost died at 25.

Near-death experiences have 

a funny way of realigning pri-
orities; you exit the other side 
more conscious of your privi-
lege of just being here. You 
take your pursuits more seri-
ously, because you know you 
almost had the opportunity 
taken from you. You fight your 
oppressors more aggressively, 
because the force that almost 
took your life is the great equal-
izer. You express yourself to the 
fullest extent, because there’s 
a heightened awareness that 
the same force will inevitably 
return, and next time it won’t 
miss.

Records about self-actual-

ization are always difficult, 
because no one wants to be set 
on their ass. No one wants to 
be reminded how much work is 
left, or hear a Black man from 
the Southside of Chicago bridge 
the gap between actual self 
and ideal self. The Kanye West 
Experience 
inherently 
pres-

ents a challenge, and though 
the packages have varied over 
the course of his sprawling 
seven-solo-album discography, 
the message has remained the 
same.

On Late Registration’s “Gone” 

he rapped “They say you don’t 
know what you got ’til it’s gone 
/ I know I got it, I don’t know 
what y’all on.” Fast-forward 
eleven years, and on “Freestyle 
4” he drunkenly snarls “Y’all 
motherfuckers only live like 
half of ya level, half of ya life.” 
He considers the prospect of 
“fucking right now in the mid-
dle of this dinner table” and 
whether or not everyone else 
would follow suit. Kanye is con-
fident that they would, and he’s 
right. Where most are hesitant 
to act on impulse, what Pastor 
’Ye ultimately preaches on this 
“gospel album” is to live fear-
lessly. When someone address-
es the elephant in the room, it 
opens the floodgates.

The biblical tone of the 

album seems a natural develop-
ment for an aging West. We’ve 
seen so many artists grow more 
reflective as they get older and 
produce 
increasingly 
auto-

biographical works; much of 
Pablo juxtaposes a return to 
traditional 
Midwest 
values 

with the Blackness of South-
side ’Ye. We get gospel, but we 
also get a reminder he’s “from 
a tribe called ‘Check-A-Hoe.’ ” 
Beware of the culture vultures 
who laugh along when he jokes 
as “ghetto Oprah” at the end of 
“Feedback,” but call him crazy 
when he wilds out at the end of 
an SNL performance.

Pablo is as Black and unapol-

ogetic as West himself — divine 
album 
opener 
“Ultralight 

Beam” makes way for a sermon 
from a Black toddler. Even gos-
pel singer and choir director 
Kirk Franklin makes an appear-
ance on the intro. Clunky, 
mechanical drums pound away 
at growling synths while Kelly 
Price howls a melody as soulful 
as anything else you’ll find in 
Kanye’s discography. And then, 
there’s that Chance feature.

Two years ago I was in the 

crowd with Chance at Kanye’s 
2014 Bonnaroo performance, 
and I remember watching him 
spaz to every cut from The Col-
lege Dropout. The intro to his 
breakout mixtape, Acid Rap, 
even samples a soulful trumpet 
melody from an early Kanye 
tape. Point being, Chance is 
a “real soulful dude,” and his 
fingerprints are all over the 
feel-good soul of “Ultralight 
Beam.” He drops an absolutely 
show-stopping verse (arguably 
the best of the album), where 
he even intertwines his narra-
tive with Big Brother: “I made 
‘Sunday Candy,’ I’m never going 
to Hell / I met Kanye West, I’m 
never going to fail.” You can 
practically hear how giddy he 
is to share the stage with ’Ye, 
and it’s great to see “Lil Channo 
from 79th” make the most of 
the occasion.

The 
intro 
segues 
direct-

ly into two-part whirlwind, 
“Father Stretch My Hands.” 
The song moves at breakneck 
speeds, 
transitioning 
from 

stretched-out soul samples, to 
Metro Boomin tags, to lyrics 
about “bleached assholes.” By 
the time it doubles in tempo for 
“Pt. 2,” Kanye frantically drops 
pixelated raps about his 2002 
accident, his mother’s death 
and his father’s financial losses 
in the market. Oh, and the song 
completely 
transforms 
into 

Brooklyn-emcee 
Desiigner’s 

“Panda.” Yes, a totally different 
song, which ’Ye had no affili-
ation with until now (though 
it should be noted that Desii-
gner has just signed to G.O.O.D. 
Music). No rules. In the first 
10 minutes of the album we’re 
completely sucked into the 
schizophrenia that’s driven so 
much of West’s most dynamic 
and troubling work.

While Kanye has a lengthy 

repertoire of music that raises 
red flags for mental health con-
cerns, there’s something about 
his recent public behavior that 
has an element of genuine, 
bona fide craziness. In just one 
week he’s publicly defended Bill 
Cosby, begged the founder of 
Facebook for funding via Twit-
ter and turned his Madison 
Square Garden album listening 
session into a Kanye & Friends 
Show and Tell.

There’s an overall air of 

incompleteness 
and 
sloppi-

ness about the album that just 
doesn’t seem to matter. He 
answers a goddamn phone call 
while recording “30 Hours” and 
yet nothing feels out of place. 
He stitches together samples 
on the latter half of “Pt. 2” with 
the seams uncharacteristical-
ly showing. Most interesting, 
though, is how he simply decid-
ed that the album rollout is an 
indefinite window. The track-
list grew 80% in length the day 
after the scheduled release, and 
he’s just announced that the 
album will never be for sale. 
The rollout itself has become a 
performance art piece.

The general consensus in 

America has been that this 
“New Kanye” is crazy, and that 
the “Old Kanye” is the one we 
all know and love. The Old 
Kanye rapped about stealing 
khakis from The Gap, called the 
president racist and interrupt-
ed Taylor Swift at the VMAs. 
The New Kanye just announced 
that he still thinks he and Tay-
lor will have sex. He has been 
stepping on our toes for over a 
decade; there’s nothing “new” 
about this Kanye.

If you approach this album 

expecting Kanye West to be 
your Lord and Savior, and are 
disappointed to find elements 
of humanity, perhaps you need 

a moment of self-reflection. 
His 
shameless 
transparency 

has defined the zeitgeist of the 
past decade precisely because 
of his willingness to broadcast 
his flaws. He’s already told us 
that everything he’s not makes 
him everything he is. He is, 
and always has been, the life-
affirming 
car 
accident 
you 

never had.

Pablo is cluttered with evi-

dence that his cultural mar-
tyrdom will outlive him. He 
looks around and sees “so many 
Kanyes,” and some of them are 
even recruited for the album. 
On “FML,” The Weeknd makes 
an appearance to let us know 
that all the hate isn’t help-
ing his already self-destruc-
tive lifestyle: “Even though I 
always fuck my life up / Only 
I can mention me.” Synths jerk 
around asymmetrically, making 
the song feel like one of those 
violent 
bathroom-meltdown 

scenes; Kanye even recalls a 
specific episode he had in Mex-
ico while “off his Lexapro.”

“Highlights” 
features 
the 

premier weirdo-rapper of the 
moment: 
Young 
Thug. 
You 

can’t help but feel that the post-
verbal rap we’re seeing from 
Thugger wouldn’t be so widely 
accepted had ’Ye not kicked the 
door in with 808s & Heartbreak. 
Unsurprisingly, Thug sounds 
right at home in the middle of 
the orchestral accompaniment, 
triumphantly shouting “Tell 
my mama that I want my whole 
life to only be mine!” Their 
public respect for one another 
shouldn’t be surprising given 
that Thug “goes motherfuckin’ 
viral” every time he redefines 
what a rapper looks like. Ten 
years ago that was ’Ye in a pink 
polo and backpack.

Away from his fledglings, the 

realest moments on the album 
have Kanye noticeably shaken 
and rattled — like when he con-
fesses to paying his cousin a 
quarter of a million dollars to 
get his stolen laptop back, on 
“Real Friends.” Ty Dolla $ign’s 
voice cracks and eventually 
breaks under the weight of the 
occasion. Kanye pauses to col-
lect his thoughts, and the beat 
leaves him behind.

He used to be so proud of 

his animalistic work ethic, 
shamelessly 
boasting 
the 

months spent locked away in 
his room. Yet even after gain-
ing the family he yearned for 
on spiritual-prequel “Welcome 
to Heartbreak,” the intensity of 
his aspirations has left much of 
Life still elusive to the “num-
ber one rockstar on the planet.” 
Brother Kanye obviously prac-
tices what he preaches, but on 
Pablo he comes to terms with 
being human.

Even if Kanye never releas-

es another album again, he 
can rest easy knowing that his 
canon of work will be revis-
ited as the definitive arbiter of 
our time. His public obsession 
with emulating Michael Jack-
son brings to mind a specific 
quote of his that could have just 
as easily belonged to Mr. West: 
“Music has been my outlet, my 
gift to all of the lovers in this 
world. Through it — my music, I 
know I will live forever.” Root-
ed in the Black Experience of 
being denied the human right 
to express, the inherent per-
manence of Kanye’s art is more 
than enough justification for 
him to scream at us.

Kanye’s 
screaming 
is 
as 

imperative for us as it is for 
him. Just as Kirk Franklin 
says on the prayer that closes 
“Ultralight Beam”: “Father, this 
prayer is for everyone that feels 
they’re not good enough. This 
prayer’s for everybody that feels 
that they’re too messed up. For 
everybody that feels they’ve 
said ‘I’m sorry’ too many times. 
You can never go too far when 
you can’t come back home again 
… That’s why I need faith!” 

We need each other as much 

as Kanye West needs God; we 
need to listen as long as there 
are muffled truths. We need 
to love one another like Kanye 
loves Kanye.

TV NOTEBOOK
‘House’ of nostalgia

By MEGAN MITCHELL

For the Daily

When I was in the fourth 

grade, there were two things 
that assured your status in the 
“it” crowd. One: You had to own 
a remarkable collection of Bobby 
Jack apparel with accompany-
ing flare capri yoga pants. Two: 
You had to be well versed in all 
of the current happenings of 
“Full House.” And let me tell you, 
fourth grade Megan was very, 
very in the “it” crowd.

If you’re a millennial, chances 

are this all sounds vaguely famil-
iar. The original “Full House” 
came and went before most of us 
were born, yet it’s a staple of the 
later millennial generation due 
to the daily reruns during our 
more pivotal years. Personally, my 
childhood revolved around “Full 
House,” crowding the television 
with friends at sleepovers and 
clutching our bowls of macaroni 
during elementary school days 
when we went home for lunch. 
Keep in mind that this exposure 
to “Full House” occurred during 
a pre-Netflix era, when our par-
ents had to tape the episodes on 
the VCR for us to enjoy later, or we 
had to plan to watch the show live. 
There was no binge-watching or 
hitting the “rewind” button if we 
missed the punch line, so much 
like “Friends,” every episode was 
unique in its own right. Between 
the years 1987 to 1995, the Tanner 
family was America’s family.

This past week, the first full-

length trailer for Netflix’s original 
series “Fuller House” premiered. 
And let me tell you, pre-recorded 
laughter never sounded oh so 
good.

The sequel follows eldest sis-

ter DJ Tanner-Fuller (Candace 
Cameron-Bure, “The View”) as 
she struggles to raise her three 
sons after her husband passes 
away. Reminiscent of the original 
sitcom, younger sister Stephanie 
Tanner (Jodie Sweetin, “Walt 
Before 
Mickey”) 
and 
child-

hood best friend Kimmy Gibbler 
(Andrea Barber, “The Skateboard 
Kid 2”) move into the San Fran-
cisco home to lend a hand and 
add to the overstuffed craziness 
that was “Full House.” But that’s 
exactly the dynamic that made 
the show work.

The Tanner family was a 

diverse family that lived under 
one very small roof. The playboy 
and rocker brother-in-law Uncle 
Jesse (John Stamos, “Grandfa-
thered”) and comedian friend 
Joey (Dave Coulier, “Muppet 
Babies”) kept the laughs rolling in 
through domestic circumstances, 
usually with a ridiculous twist. 
(Can we also just mention the fact 
that John Stamos hasn’t aged like, 
a single day??) Changing baby 
diapers turned into a fiasco that 
took two grown men and a roll of 
paper towels to complete while 
bath time called for a “Love Me 
Tender” rendition in the bath-
tub. Overall, Jesse and Joey kept 
Danny Tanner (Bob Saget, “How 
I Met Your Mother”) sane and 
kept the series light and airy in 
a role I can only assume Kimmy 
and Steph will later play into in 
the sequel. Given what is featured 
in the trailer, Stamos and Coulier 
aren’t likely to reprise their roles 
as the caretakers, but rather as 
background leads while Kimmy 
and Steph take the reins and fulfill 
their roles as the obligatory aunts.

In 2013, Pixar Studios released 

their first ever prequel, “Mon-
sters University,” as an accom-
paniment 
to 
the 
childhood 

favorite “Monsters Inc.” The 
release dates between the movies 
were 12 years apart, which unin-
tentionally lined up with the age 
of the original audience. When 
Mike Wazowski went to college, 
so did we.

Now, Netflix producers are tak-

ing a page out of Pixar Studios’s 
playbook with their reboot of 
“Full House”. In fact, I wouldn’t 
go as far as to call “Fuller House” 
a reboot, but rather a continuation 
of the original series. Whereas 
reboots are strikingly different 
and compete for the popular opin-
ion of battling fanbases, this mini-
series will continue the story of 
the Tanner family almost 21 years 
after we left them. By bringing the 
original cast back, they’re speak-
ing directly to the original audi-
ence and relating to the struggles 
that life may have handed some 
of us over the past twenty years. 
They could have chosen to reboot 
the entire series for a new audi-
ence, but they’re providing a 
sequel for our generation and the 
next to equally enjoy. We grew up 
with the Tanners, so it’s only fair 
that they’ve grown up with us.

All I can say for now is that I 

hope “Fuller House” stays true to 
the original. Without the grainy 
picture of the 1990s to revive the 
ambiance of the original, we have 
to rely on the cast to bring us back 
to the Lower Pacific Heights of 
the Tanner residence. As far as 
the trailer has us covered, I think 
we’re all in for a major flashback.

“Fuller House” will be available 

on Netflix starting Feb. 26, 2016.

A 

lot of binaries we use 
are helpful; by placing 
parts of the world in 

opposing categories, we create 
order out of what is otherwise 
chaos.

In the 

same vein, a 
lot of these 
binaries are 
also bullshit 
oversimplifi-
cations that 
can be just 
as harm-
ful as they 
are helpful. 
Gender and 
sexuality, for 
example, both exist on a spec-
trum, but throughout our lives, 
we’re taught otherwise. You 
either enter a men’s restroom 
or a women’s one. If you’re a 
guy, you either go to prom with 
a girl or (assuming you attend 
a progressive high school and 
feel safe enough to) a fellow 
dude. One or the other. No in-
between. No overlap. And you’d 
better believe this logic is ever 
present in hip hop as well: The 
binary of interest is none other 
than underground vs. main-
stream. I’d like to apologize in 
advance for writing about this 
— it’s always an annoying con-
versation because it’s always 
impossible to come to a resolu-
tion. But the fact that these 
conversations never result in an 
answer is the answer.

The guidelines determin-

ing whether much of hip hop 
belongs to the gritty under-
ground or the glamorous 
mainstream are built on a weak 
foundation, and with just a 
few case examples, the binary 
comes apart at the seams.

“If skills sold, truth be told/ 

I’d probably be/ Lyrically/ Talib 
Kweli/ Truthfully I wanna 
rhyme like Common Sense/ But I 
did 5 mill — I ain’t been rhyming 
like Common since”

In just a few bars in 

“Moment of Clarity,” Jay Z 
summarizes the entire sup-
posed foundational distinc-
tion between underground 

and mainstream rap. Intricate 
rhymes that may take multiple 
listens to reason through, like 
Talib’s, aren’t found in the 
mainstream because they don’t 
have mass appeal. Nonetheless, 
they’re more impressive, so it’s 
likely that the most talented, 
technical MCs are down below 
in the dungeons of rap. But even 
the earliest rappers wanted 
to be able to eat off rhyming. 
And there’s no money in that 
complex, usually conscious and 
often political underground 
shit. That’s why Hov dumbed 
down his lyrics — to “double 
(his) dollars.”

There are categories 

spawned in academia that are 
relevant and actually line up 
really nicely here. Shorthose 
and Strange (2004) describe 
pure artistic work as that 
which is an “expression of 
one’s creative capacity through 
self-determined labor.” On the 
other hand, managed creativ-
ity is “alienated work within 
orthodox capitalist relations 
of production.” Regardless of 
which explanation you resonate 
with more, they both distin-
guish art in the same respect. 
The real, the raw, the good stuff 
is in the underground because 
it isn’t confined to commercial 
stipulations for success, which 
also means it isn’t going to pay 
any bills.

From Eyedea & Abilities and 

Big L, to MF Doom and Immor-
tal Tech — yes, some of the 
most multifaceted rappers with 
uncanny abilities to manipulate 
the English language never 
breach the mainstream. But the 
most critically acclaimed and 
almost most commercially suc-
cessful album of 2015 (behind 
only Drizzy in units moved) 
was from a rapper many would 
dub conscious, even if he denies 
it: Kendrick. An adequate 
account of the genius that is 
To Pimp A Butterfly requires 
an entire column of its own. 
Needless to say, it’s as intricate 
as it is intense, confronting 
still-unresolved racial skel-
etons lying in America’s closet. 
TPAB is bold, brooding and 
extremely Black — far from the 
“money, clothes, hoes” mantra 
so strongly associated with Bill-
board top charts. With topics 
as explicitly political as police 
brutality and Black power, 
complemented with a funky 
soundtrack fused with jazz and 
sprinkled with soul, the kid 
from Compton still went plati-
num. How Sway? Doesn’t that 
go against the guidelines?

This rule is often broken in 

the alternative sense as well 
— when underground rappers 
think they’re being revolution-
ary, key word think. Brand 
Nubian’s 1990 release One for 
All is widely lauded as being 
one of the coolest, most colorful 
and socially-conscious projects 
of its time. The biggest hit, 
“Slow Down,” may be accom-
panied with a melodic hook 
and hypnotic beat, but there’s 
nothing mesmerizing about the 
relentless misogyny, only grow-
ing worse from verse to verse. 
It culminates in Grand Puba 
expressing his anger at “stunts” 
[’90s for “hoes”] who like to 
have sex, maybe in exchange 
for “a forty and a blunt, that’s 
all she really wants.” He ever-
so-intellectually ponders “what 
makes a bitch want to act in 
this way,” but, in the end, real-
izes he doesn’t care: “If you 
want to live foul and be a dumb 
diddy dumb dumb bitch/ Well 
go ahead.” He’s still not down 
with it though, and so con-
tinues to pass judgment and 
wants to make sure you know 
it through the use of redundant 
word choice: “You’re living 
foul.” Great, got it.

The underground can be 

just as regressive as the main-
stream. But the mainstream can 
also be as monetarily discour-
aging as the underground.

“Y’all a disgrace to C-P-T/ 

Cause you’re getting fucked out 
your green by a white boy, with 
no Vaseline.”

Jerry Heller is the white boy 

Ice Cube refers to, infamously 
known for managing NWA and 

favoring some members over 
others while doing so. Though 
Eazy-E was best taken care of 
by Heller, it was Cube who was 
the best writer in the group 
and composed the majority of 
the lyrics heard on Straight 
Outta Compton, the group’s 
best selling release. Remember 
“Express Yourself”? Remember 
thinking, damn, Dre can really 
rap after hearing it? Yeah, Cube 
wrote that too. Eventually, 
Cube said fuck it and left. And 
understandably so. Though 
Eazy was something like the 
star of the show, the compensa-
tion simply wasn’t fair; in fact, 
E didn’t write much if anything 
at all. But it was Eazy who 
founded Ruthless Records with 
Heller, so it was Eazy who’d 
see most of the returns. Lesson 
learned: Just because you make 
it, doesn’t necessarily mean 
you’re going to make much 
anyway.

And NWA isn’t an exception 

to the rule. It actually is the 
rule: Specifically, “Industry 
rule number four thousand and 
eighty/ Record company people 
are shady.” There’s a long his-
tory of labels exploiting their 
artists. I’m not going to get into 
the TLC story because, hon-
estly, it’s too sad. But read up if 
you’re unfamiliar. In this day 
and age, though, exploitation 
follows a perfected pattern: 
Sign the artist after he drops 
a dance hit that catapults him 
onto the scene, milk him for all 
he’s got, and either shelve any 
projects he’s interested in or 
release him soon after. Much 
of the exploitation — the only 
way you can get some dollars is 
if you dance for it — bears eerie 
resemblance to the legacies of 
slavery. So going mainstream 
doesn’t guarantee a steady 
income; in some cases, it can 
actually threaten it. Mean-
while, there’s a host of under-
ground artists who release 
projects predominantly for 
free, yet are able to put food on 
the table through touring, mer-
chandise sales and the like. And 
avoid dealing with any label 
execs along the way.

There are a lot of important 

conversations to have regarding 
underground vs. mainstream 
rap. Many have to do with the 
transition from the former to 
the latter and the stages artists 
go through, beginning with 
the humble come-up and ide-
ally culminating in platinum 
plaques. In the Internet age, 
where so many have the abil-
ity to release music of their 
own, what implications does 
this oversaturation of talent 
have? In addition, there’s a 
lot of contention surrounding 
going commercial and it being 
equated to selling out; and in 
the world of hip hop, not much 
is more important than keeping 
it real. How is this assumption 
complicated by artists who 
maintain their artistic integ-
rity and still manage to reach 
best-seller lists? And when 
artists evolve upon garner-
ing mainstream attention, and 
their sounds change, is it unfair 
to get mad at them for not hav-
ing a static identity throughout 
their career?

I don’t have the answer to 

many of these questions, but 
before we can really get into 
any of this, it’s important to 
complicate the underground vs. 
mainstream distinction. When 
categories are placed on oppos-
ing ends of a spectrum, they’re 
easier to understand but more 
difficult to work with. A little 
confusion can actually bring us 
some clarity. By accepting that 
there are a lot of exceptions 
to the rules used to differen-
tiate between underground 
and mainstream, so many 
that it’s questionable to even 
refer to them as exceptions, 
there’s room for variation, for 
richer propositions. Finally, it 
becomes possible that the next 
time you do engage with this 
topic, you won’t end up wanting 
to hurt somebody.

New documentary 
explores American 

ideals abroad

By DANIEL HENSEL

For the Daily

“Oh, we live in sick times, 

sick, sick times.” About two 
minutes into his 1997 film 
“The Big One,” 
documentar-
ian 
Michael 

Moore (“Roger 
& Me”) relays 
his 
political 

outlook to an 
audience 
at 

Northwestern 
University. 
During 
the 

presidential 
campaign 
that year, Moore had sent $100 
checks signed by groups with 
objectionable 
names 
(Pedo-

philes for Free Trade and Abor-
tionists for [Pat] Buchanan 
are two examples) to each of 
the four prominent candidates 
at the time. “And who do you 
think cashed the check first?” 
Moore asks the audience.

Nearly 20 years later, in his 

new 
documentary, 
“Where 

to Invade Next,” Moore is as 
unabashedly 
progressive 
as 

ever. This film, though, takes 
a more subversive path. While 
Moore’s previous films promi-
nently featured the documen-
tarian and his crew attempting 
to speak to CEOs at their offices 
to question their efforts to out-
source labor and lay off Ameri-
can 
workers 
during 
record 

profits, “Where to Invade Next” 
finds Moore off American soil, 
seeking to improve America by 
“invading” other nations and 
claiming their ideas as our own. 
Moore finds himself speaking 
to Italian business executives 
and Portuguese police officers, 
Norwegian prison guards and 
Icelandic politicians.

“Where to Invade Next” is 

endlessly hopeful. Though each 

interview features cutaways to 
relevant tragedies in contempo-
rary American history, the end 
of each segment seems to stare 
into the eyes of Americans and 
say, “We can do this. We can 
fix these problems.” And while 
Michael Moore could have 
cemented his work’s legacy as 
a response to Bush-era politics, 
“Where to Invade Next” finds 
relevance in the still-unsolved 
problems in American poli-
tics and society over the last 
few decades. Labor, education, 
nutrition, student debt, drugs, 
prisons and women’s rights 
are all discussed, and it is in 
this way that Moore creates 
his most relevant film in some 
time. His ability to touch on all 
these matters with a height-
ened sophistication — rather 
than attempting to ambush 
executives to identify prob-
lems, here he talks to problem 
solvers who discuss their solu-
tions — demonstrates his dedi-
cation to actually address these 
issues in the real world, beyond 
the cinemas.

And 
although 
he’s 
more 

sophisticated, Moore is still 
his acerbic, subversive self. By 
framing the film as a form of 
non-violent 
and 
self-serving 

imperialism, Moore not-so-sub-
tly reminds his audience that 
the practice of invading nations 
to steal their good ideas can 
be as American as actual mili-
tary invasion. “Make Love, Not 
War” becomes “Steal Ideas, Not 
Lives.” And as we learn near the 
conclusion of the film, these 
ideas all came out of America in 
the first place. The Norwegian 
practice of putting prisoners in 

more trusting and friendly pris-
ons was adapted from Ameri-
ca’s 8th Amendment, forbidding 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
Tunisia’s recent wave of wom-
en’s rights bills was inspired by 
the Equal Rights Amendment, 
which was heavily debated in 
1972 but never passed.

At 119 minutes, “Where to 

Invade Next” certainly drags 
and feels redundant, especially 
later in the film. We see two 
different segments on labor 
rights, two different segments 
on education and two different 
segments on women’s rights. 
Moore’s unapologetic progres-
sivism also prevents him, and 
us, from effectively under-
standing the complexities of 
each issue. Sure, these are great 
solutions for these countries, 
but what are the drawbacks? 
What are the sacrifices? Would 
these solutions work in Ameri-
ca? Further, what should we do 
about it? Those with the fore-
sight to stay through the credits 
will be able to see what Moore 
makes of his ending message of 
guidance, but for all the solu-
tions Moore provides, he ends 
the documentary without guid-
ing the audience to knowing 
how to actually institute these 
changes. The important ques-
tions are left unanswered, per-
haps strategically so, to leave a 
slightly disillusioned aftertaste.

Still, “Where to Invade Next” 

shows Moore at his most poi-
gnant. One particular scene 
features a German school, with 
young students learning about 
the Holocaust. Their education 
teaches them to be critical of 
their government, but the stu-
dents are no less proud of their 
country. They’re Germans who 
are aware their government 
failed their people and other 
countries’ people in the past. 
This scene is an apt analogy for 
Michael Moore and his rela-
tionship with America; regard-
less of one’s opinion of him, it’s 
hard to deny that Moore doesn’t 
have its citizens’ best interests 
at heart.

Wolverines to take on Ferris State

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 6 Michigan hockey 

team takes a break from Big Ten 
play to take on in-state rival 
Ferris State on 
Friday night at 
Yost Ice Arena.

The unusual 

disruption 
in 

conference play 
will be a rare 
opportunity 
to watch the 
Wolverines 
play 
a 
stout 

defensive 
opponent. 
The 
Bulldogs 

have posted a 
respectable 2.5 
goals-against 
average 
this 

season — good enough for 20th 
in the NCAA — but have been 
especially impressive in the 
second half. Since Jan. 1, they 
have lowered that mark to 1.7. 
In contrast, Michigan’s GAA of 
3.0 ranks in the bottom half of 
Division I hockey.

The game is a throwback to 

the CCHA era for the Wolverines 
in terms of opposition — Ferris 
State was a fellow member — 
and playing style. The Bulldogs 
have given Michigan (9-2-3 Big 
Ten, 18-4-5 overall) fits since 
the dissolution of the conference 
three years ago, compiling two 
wins and a tie in three games.

“Ferris State has been good 

about reaching out to Michigan,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. “When the Big Ten 
formed three years ago, instead 
of us having to schedule four 
non-conference games, we have 
to schedule 14. Why not play 
some of the teams from the 
CCHA that still want to play us?”

This year, Ferris State (12-8-4 

WCHA, 14-10-6) has been held 
together by standout freshman 

goaltender Darren Smith. Since 
assuming 
the 
starting 
role, 

Smith has provided a solid 
foundation for a team that has 
been 
otherwise 
tumultuous. 

His .932 save percentage is the 
second best among freshmen, 
and the best when limiting that 
group to netminders who logged 
over 1000 minutes.

“They can skate and they can 

play, but their DNA has been 
their defense,” Berenson said.

Wolverine fans will also be 

happy to see freshman forward 
Cooper Marody return to the 
ice after a prolonged absence 
from illness. Berenson plans to 
play Marody alongside senior 
forward 
Justin 
Selman 
and 

freshman 
forward 
Brendan 

Warren.

“(Cooper) 
feels 
good,” 

Berenson said. “He wants to 
play and he’s had a few practices 
now. It’s going to take him a little 
while to get caught up in terms 
of quickness and conditioning, 
but that’s why you have to play.”

Marody’s 
return, 
and 
a 

potential shakeup on defense, 
will result in a lineup shuffle. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone 
is 
out, 
while 

sophomore 
defender 
Cutler 

Martin took reps at forward 
in practice. He would give 
Michigan 
a 
bigger 
physical 

presence 
on 
offense 
while 

sophomore defender Sam Piazza 

fills the void on defense.

As senior goaltender Steve 

Racine’s play has improved, 
much of the spotlight has been 
focused on the shaky defensive 
unit. Michigan’s coaching staff 
has reiterated the emphasis on 
bringing down the goals-against 
average before the postseason, 
but one stat supporting the 
Wolverines’ case as contenders 
is goal margin. Michigan’s goal 
margin per game mark of 1.78 is 
fourth in the nation.

When Ferris arrives with its 

hard-nosed style Friday night, 
it should offer the best chance 
yet to evaluate just how far the

Michigan set for 
Seminole faceoff

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

On Feb. 21 of last year, fifth-

year senior right-handed pitcher 
Sara Driesenga threw five solid 
innings to lead the Michigan 
softball team to a 13-1 victory over 
Oklahoma.

It turned out to be her last 

game of the season.

As the Wolverines chased their 

second national championship in 
Oklahoma City, Driesenga could 
only help her teammates from the 
dugout due to a rib injury.

Now, a healthy Driesenga has 

No. 2 Michigan (4-1) in prime 
position to make another deep 
run in the Women’s College 
World Series.

In four games — including 

two starts — Driesenga leads the 
Wolverines pitching staff with a 
1.85 ERA and 11.1 innings pitched.

Needless to say, Driesenga 

loves pitching in the circle again.

“We had our fall games and it 

was good to get back out there,” 
Driesenga said. “(But) to be out 
there when it matters, to know 
that everyone is still behind me no 
matter what happens, it’s great.”

Driesenga and the Wolverines 

will look to build on their 
successful showing from their 
first weekend in Tallahassee, 
where they will take on Florida 
State and Virginia Tech in the 
ACC/Big Ten Challenge.

The 
Wolverines 
have 

experience playing against the 
Hokies, defeating them, 3-1, in 
the final game of last week’s USF 
Wilson-Demarini tournament.

Despite the previous result, 

though, Michigan has chosen to 
downplay the victory, instead 
focusing on how it can improve. 
The game was the only one that 
lasted the full seven innings, and 
the Wolverines scored just three 
runs, their lowest total in their 
four wins.

As a result, Michigan coach 

Carol Hutchins believes her team 
must play better both offensively 
and defensively this time around, 
as it may once again face Hokies 
right-handed 
pitcher 
Maggie 

Tyler, their innings-eater and No. 
1 starter.

“We were definitely getting 

behind and swinging at her 

pitches,” Hutchins said. “When 
a pitcher is ahead, and they’re 
smart, they won’t give you 
something good to hit. So I think 
we can command the zone better 
and force (Tyler) to bring it in, 
that will be our strategy.”

Some 
Wolverines, 
though, 

believe 
the 
rematch 
against 

Virginia 
Tech 
will 
prove 

beneficial in preparing for games 
later in the season when the 
team will compete in three-game 
series.

“If we do see that pitcher 

again, a lot of us will have a 
game plan in mind,” said senior 
outfielder Olivia Richvalsky. “We 
will definitely be taking what we 
learned from the first game to get 
ready for Big Ten.”

In 
Michigan’s 
other 
two 

games, it will face the Seminoles, 
who it defeated twice last season.

The Wolverines will pay close 

attention to Florida State’s two 
Jessicas: infielder Jessica Warren, 
who hit 19 home runs last year 
and has seven RBI thus far, and 
redshirt junior pitcher Jessica 
Burroughs, who has a 1.65 ERA 
on the season.

In last weekend’s tournament, 

Michigan drew 22 walks, a 
testament to the team’s emphasis 
on patience at the plate.

“We 
definitely 
emphasize 

commanding the zone, (taking) 
what they give you,” Hutchins 
said. “If they give you a meatball, 
smack it. If they give you a ball, 
take it, because walks are as good 
as hits. We emphasize being on 
base, anything you can do to be on 
base (because) walks are equally 
effective.”

While Driesenga is back and 

injury-free, junior right-hander 
Megan Betsa is still ailing. She 
was 
considered 
questionable 

before last week’s slate of games 
but managed to pitch 10 innings 
and strike out 20.

Hutchins believes Betsa will 

play, but how much remains 
unclear.

“She’s improving. I expect 

she’ll 
pitch 
some 
innings,” 

Hutchins said. “How many will 
be dictated by how she’s feeling.”

But with a healthy Driesenga 

and a strong, patient offense, 
Michigan will have a good chance 
regardless of its ace’s health.

SOFTBALL

‘M’ hosts Penn State on Senior Day

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Sitting at No. 9 in the Big 

Ten standings, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team is still 
on pace to avoid 
the four-team 
play-in 
series 

that kicks off 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament.

But 
as 

Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes 
Arico 

has 
said 

countless times 
this 
season, 

anything 
can 

happen on any 
given day, so 
all is still up for 
grabs in this 
final stretch.

The Wolverines (7-8 Big Ten, 

15-11 overall) have three games 

left to solidify a spot in the 
Big Ten’s top 10, and it starts 
Saturday when they host Penn 
State.

Michigan played the Lady 

Lions (5-10, 10-16) back on Jan. 
17, escaping Happy Valley with 
its first win there since 2001.

The 15-year drought ended 

when 
three 
of 
Michigan’s 

guards — sophomore Katelynn 
Flaherty, 
freshman 
Boogie 

Brozoski and senior Madison 
Ristovski — combined to go 
13-for-14 from the free-throw 
line in the last minute of play.

Penn State remained in the 

game down the stretch, but 
Michigan was able to seal it from 
the charity stripe.

“Anytime you get a win (at 

Penn State)… well, it’s not an 
easy place to win,” Barnes Arico 
said after the game. “To come 
away with a win is satisfying. We 
led most of the game and really 
made great runs, but they made 

big baskets.”

In that game, Flaherty scored 

a team-high 23 points to lead the 
Wolverines to a 91-87 victory. 
The midseason 
game 
was 

a 
huge 

confidence 
boost for the 
Wolverines, 
who 
were 

coming off a 
narrow loss to 
Maryland.

Oddly 

enough, 
Michigan 
has 

a similar script written this 
weekend.

Having lost to No. 6 Maryland 

on Wednesday by 20 points, 
despite 
leading 
at 
halftime, 

Michigan has yet another chance 
to bounce back after the Terrapins 
halted its three-game win streak.

A 
flight 
delay 
scrambled 

the Wolverines’ travel plans, 

landing them in Maryland at 3 
a.m., much later than scheduled. 
Barnes Arico commented after 
the game that the delay and lack 

of rest may 
have 
been 

part 
of 
the 

reason 
the 

Wolverines 
“were 
exhausted 
in the fourth 
quarter.”

This 

weekend, 
though, 
Michigan 

stays home and there are no 
excuses.

Saturday’s game at Crisler 

Center also marks the last 
scheduled 
home 
game 
for 

Michigan’s 
three 
seniors 
— 

guards Madison Ristovski and 
fifth-year Halle Wangler and 
forward Kelsey Mitchell.

Wangler 
does 
not 
make 

regular appearances, but both 
Mitchell 
and 
Ristovski 
have 

taken on larger roles as starters 
this season, and their additions 
have supported the Wolverines 
at crucial times. Ristovski (6.7 
points per game, 3.4 assists, 2.6 
rebounds) and Mitchell (7.2 points 
per game, 4.8 rebounds) have both 
been consistent in boosting an 
underclassmen-heavy team.

While Michigan could return 

to Crisler in the postseason for 
the WNIT, the seniors have been 
nostalgic about their last run 
since early in the campaign.

“It’s very weird that I’m 

already a senior,” Ristovski 
said on the team’s media day 
in October. “I feel like the last 
three years have gone by so 
quickly.”

Ristovski’s 
career 
has 

seen many ups and downs, 
highlighted 
by 
an 
NCAA 

Tournament 
appearance 
her 

freshman year and a deep run to 
the WNIT semifinals last year.

NCAA Tournament chances 

are waning, and making a run 
in Big Ten Tournament is the 
team’s best hope.

Another win against Penn 

State this weekend can put the 
Wolverines in a position to do 
just that.

Donnal finds himself as ‘M’ big man

After long quest for 
confidence, junior 
forward appears 
ready to carry load

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

As a high-school sophomore, 

Mark Donnal sat down with 
Bryan Borcherdt, a longtime 
coach and family friend, to 
discuss his future prospects.

Borcherdt asked Donnal a 

simple question: How do you 
envision your future?

The coach saw a 6-foot-9 

prospect who could run, shoot 
and defend, one with the potential 
to succeed at the highest level. 
For some reason, Donnal saw 
something different.

“I remember him looking 

at me, saying, ‘Maybe a mid-
major?’ ” Borcherdt said. “I 
don’t think he realized.”

Donnal may not have been 

aware of his potential then, but 
his abilities soon became obvious 
and unavoidable.

That 
potential 
was 
never 

more apparent than on June 15, 
2011, when Borcherdt let a call 
he never expected to receive 
go to voicemail. He had since 
been hired as the head coach at 
Anthony Wayne High School 
in Monclova, Ohio, and was 
engrossed in running a summer 
youth basketball camp, too busy 
for the unrecognized number on 
the other end.

When Borcherdt checked his 

messages a few hours later, he 
saw the call might have been 
worth taking after all. Waiting in 
his voicemail was a brief greeting 
from Chris Collins, then an 
assistant coach at Duke and now 
the head coach at Northwestern. 
Collins wanted to speak with 
Anthony Wayne’s budding star in 
the low post: Mark Donnal.

The Blue Devils had come 

calling for a player who had 

thought, 
albeit 
fleetingly, 

his 
potential 
more 
closely 

corresponded to a program like 
Toledo or Bowling Green. But 
upon consulting with Donnal, 
then a rising junior at Anthony 
Wayne, Borcherdt could only 
smile. Duke was too late.

As it happened, June 15, 

2011, was also the day Donnal 
committed to play for Michigan 
and for John Beilein.

“Mark said, ‘Tell them I’m a 

Wolverine,’ ” Borcherdt recalled.

It was a day Donnal never 

could have envisioned, even 
during 
his 
check-in 
with 

Borcherdt a season before.

In that year, Donnal morphed 

from a player who didn’t think 
he had a shot to play in the Big 
Ten to a player comfortable 
enough in his destination — Ann 
Arbor — to turn away interest 
from a program that had won 
the national championship the 
year before.

Donnal 
says 
the 
decision 

seems stranger now than it did 
four years ago. Turning down 
any level of interest from Duke 
simply seemed like the natural 
thing to do at the time, and he has 
never regretted the decision not 
to pursue Collins’ interest, saying 
he was “locked in” at Michigan.

It’s not that Donnal had a 

crisis in confidence. It’s simply 
that those around him assumed, 
perhaps too optimistically, that 
he knew his 
true potential. 
In 
the 
end, 

Borcherdt 
and the other 
influences 
in 

Donnal’s 
life 

needed 
to 

spell 
things 

out 
more 

explicitly. 
They 
told 

Donnal 
he 

was destined for a successful 
program 
in 
a 
Power 
Five 

conference, not a run-of-the-mill 
Midwestern mid-major.

“Just 
to 
hear 
somebody 

express that level of confidence 
in me was huge,” Donnal said 
of his early-career conversation 
with Borcherdt. “I think that was 
something of a turning point.”

Borcherdt 
was 
eventually 

proven right. Donnal is averaging 

10.2 points per 
game 
in 
Big 

Ten play this 
season and has 
embraced 
his 

role as a big 
man who can 
rebound, take 
charges 
and 

play 
defense, 

even 
against 

players 
who 

dwarf him in 

the low post.

Donnal’s 
junior-year 

emergence, however, was difficult 
to predict. He spent his freshman 
season redshirting, working to 
build strength and size so he 
could contend in a conference 
where big men take a beating.

The work paid off, at least in 

the short term. Donnal began his 
sophomore season as Michigan’s 
starter at the ‘5’ position, but 
struggled in the early going 
and quickly lost the job to true 
freshman Ricky Doyle.

This year, Donnal once again 

began the season as Michigan’s 
starter, but once again, his early-
season 
performance 
wasn’t 

enough to keep Doyle out of the 
starting five.

Donnal scored just 3.4 points 

per game that season, serving 
as a jarring symbol of the 
Wolverines’ lackluster year, in 
which they finished 16-16 and 
missed the postseason entirely — 
all on the heels of an Elite Eight 
appearance during Donnal’s first 
year and a Final Four run the 
season before.

Playing 
time 
came 

inconsistently for Donnal last 
season, 
especially 
as 
Doyle 

excelled in the early season and 
Max Bielfeldt came on strong 
toward the end. Donnal played 15 
minutes or more just seven times, 
leaving him far short of where 

he’d hoped to be after his year on 
the bench.

To 
add 
insult 
to 
injury, 

Michigan 
announced 
at 
the 

beginning of the 2015-16 season 
that Donnal had been reclassified 
from a redshirt sophomore to a 
junior, meaning that a potential 
fifth year would have to be 
earned, not assumed.

“There 
are 
really 
two 

directions people can go when 
they’re frustrated,” said Donnal’s 
brother 
Andrew, 
a 
former 

offensive lineman at Iowa who 
currently plays for the NFL’s Los 
Angeles Rams. “Some people 
introvert. They go inside, they 
kind of clam up. Other guys come 
out, and that’s definitely Mark. 
He definitely excels in his game 
when things aren’t good.”

Determined to not let his 

sophomore season repeat itself, 
the younger Donnal did exactly 
that, 
punctuating 
an 
early-

season comeback with a 26-point 
outburst at Illinois on Dec. 30.

That performance harkened 

back to a similarly defining 
moment during Donnal’s high-
school days. His AAU squad, 
the Indiana Elite, traveled to 
Bloomington in May 2011 to face 
a team featuring three future 
college stars: Indiana’s James 
Blackmon Jr., Xavier’s Trevon 
Blueitt and current Utah Jazz 
forward Trey Lyles, who left 
for the NBA last year after his 
freshman season at Kentucky.

Donnal was unfazed.
“Mark kicked the living hell 

out of them,” said Dan Dakich, 
the current ESPN analyst and 
former assistant at Indiana, 
who coached the Elite at the 
time. “He tore up Trey Lyles in 
Assembly Hall when those kids 
were sophomores and juniors.”

Donnal’s 23 points paced the 

Elite, and his block of Blueitt’s 
buzzer-beating 
shot 
attempt 

sealed the 78-77 upset.

“I think there are definitely 

parallels,” 
Donnal 
said, 

comparing the AAU performance 
to 
the 
breakout 
game 
in 

Champaign. “Both were huge 
confidence boosters.”

After 
the 
Illinois 
game, 

Donnal said, he felt as if a 
weight had been lifted from 
his back. On the court, the 
difference in his confidence is 
palpable, especially in games 
when he’s forced head to head 
with some of the country’s elite 
interior players, like Maryland’s 
Diamond Stone or Purdue’s A.J. 
Hammons. Donnal seems to be 
in the right place at the right 
time far more often, and after 
fighting off a bout of early-
season foul trouble, he’s playing 
vertical defense and rebounding 
against 7-footers, keying the 
Wolverines’ upsets of then-No. 
18 Purdue on Feb. 13 and No. 3 
Maryland on Jan. 12.

It’s similar to the process 

that took place after the early-
high school conversation with 
Borcherdt, after which Donnal 
says he was more able to embrace 
his ability to excel. Playing with 
the mentality of a player who 
can excel at Michigan, Donnal 
says, has been a similar process, 
one that seems to be nearing its 
final stages.

Confidence, though, is hardly 

the only aspect of Donnal’s 
emotional profile that has changed 

since high school, when many 
close to Donnal say he needed to 
be angry to play his best.

“I told John Beilein, and I 

told Jeff Meyer when they were 
recruiting him, look, you can’t 
be nice to Mark,” Dakich said. 
“If you were nice to Mark, that 
was a problem. Because if you 
want him to be angry, you need 
to be angry.”

Donnal chalks that up to “high-

school Mark,” saying Dakich’s 
assessment rang more true in 
high school than it does now.

“Coach Dakich was always 

good about letting me know 
there’s another gear,” Donnal 
said. “The coaching staff here is 
the same way. I don’t know if it’s 
necessarily about a need to be 
frustrated, but they definitely 
let me know there’s always 
another level.”

Regardless of whether he plays 

to that level, Donnal displays little 
emotion during games, especially 
compared to teammates like 
Spike Albrecht or Zak Irvin.

Donnal prefers to do his talking 

on the court, and whether he’s 
getting stonewalled or playing 
the game of his career, that’s the 
way 
things 

have 
always 

been. 
The 

quiet on-court 
persona, 
however, isn’t 
necessarily 
intentional.

“It’s 
not 

necessarily 
that I prefer to 
fly under the radar,” Donnal said. 
“It’s just that I haven’t spent that 
much time in the spotlight.”

If there’s anybody who knows 

how Donnal behaves when he’s 
frustrated, it’s Andrew, who 
claims to hold an advantage over 
his younger brother in a one-on-
one driveway basketball series 
that now dates back more than 
a decade.

“Everything 
was 
a 

competition,” 
Andrew 
said. 

“Who could drink their drink 
the fastest, who could eat dinner 
the fastest. We loved going in the 
driveway and playing basketball 
and beating up on each other.”

Mark disputes his brother’s 

claim 
that 
he 
was 
at 
a 

disadvantage in their sibling 
rivalry, 
three-year 
age 
gap 

notwithstanding. 
The 
two 

have obvious strengths and 
weaknesses. Mark, a willowy 6 
foot 9, has a body better suited 
for basketball; Andrew’s stocky, 
6-foot-6 frame is suited better to 
the duties of an NFL offensive 
lineman.

As Andrew recalled, a loss in the 

driveway used to generate roughly 
the same emotional response — 
outwardly, anyway — as a win at 
Crisler Center does today.

Mark agrees that he’s not 

one to clue somebody into his 
emotional state or his mind’s 
inner workings unless they’re 
in his inner circle to begin with. 
Donnal is as reserved when 
speaking to the media as he was 
before he was a starter averaging 
double-digit scoring totals, and 
rarely lets his frustration after 
a loss — or, for that matter, his 
elation after a win — show.

Andrew, 
of 
course, 
is 
a 

member of that inner circle, and 
Mark hasn’t hesitated to use 

his older brother as a resource, 
especially given their similar 
experiences as Big Ten athletes. 
Andrew 
also 
redshirted 
his 

freshman year, and though the 
hiatus was more expected for 
a developing offensive lineman 
than for a basketball player, he 
made sure to discuss the proper 
mentality for a year off during 
Mark’s freshman season.

“A lot of guys are physically 

ready and have the skill set out 
of high school,” Andrew said. 
“And it’s not that Mark didn’t 
— I just think that for him to be 
able to compete better in the Big 
Ten, he did need to get bigger 
and stronger. I just told him that 
it can be frustrating, because 
you’re the only one that’s gonna 
be redshirting. All the other 
freshmen he came in with were 
going to be playing.”

To add to the frustration, one 

of those classmates — junior 
guard Zak Irvin — made 3-point 
shooting his ticket to playing time 
during his freshman campaign. 
Donnal, known as much for his 
shooting ability as with anything 
else during high school, was 
forced to learn quickly that as a 

‘5’ at Michigan, 
he wouldn’t get 
the perimeter 
looks 
he 

enjoyed in high 
school.

“In 
our 

league, in our 
area, having a 
6-foot-9 player, 
I’d have been 

foolish to not have him in the 
post,” Borcherdt said of Donnal’s 
inside-out game in high school, 
when he dealt with the same 
dilemma.

Beilein has spoken similarly 

of Donnal’s transition, saying 
he likely came to Michigan 
assuming 3-point shooting would 
be his meal ticket. Michigan, in 
its media guides last season, even 
dubbed Doyle “The Rim Rocker” 
and Donnal “The Shooter.”

Donnal prefers the simpler 

set 
of 
nicknames 
bestowed 

upon the pair by assistant coach 
Bacari Alexander: “Thunder” 
and “Lightning.”

In his renaissance, Donnal 

has learned to play more like 
Thunder, showing off the type 
of 
competitiveness 
Andrew 

remembers from him as a child.

“He is emotional, but he’s 

emotional in his own way,” 
Andrew Donnal said. “He’s not 
outgoing, he’s not a hoo-rah guy 
— he’s a guy who’s going to come 
to work every day and do his job 
and not make a fuss about it.”

Donnal has certainly never 

made a fuss — not when Beilein 
told him he’d be redshirting his 
freshman year, or when Doyle 
beat him out for the starting job 
last season, or when it seemed for 
a two-week stretch this year that 
recent history had repeated itself.

Now carrying the confidence 

of a Big Ten big man, Donnal 
seems ready to carry the load 
down low for the Wolverines, 
doing whatever’s asked for a team 
still reeling from two season-long 
injuries impacting its two senior 
stars and struggling to stay afloat.

For that responsibility, Donnal 

finally 
seems 
ready. 
“High-

school Mark,” as Donnal put it, 
might be surprised.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Junior forward Mark Donnal, who lost the starting job at the ‘5’ position in each of the past two years, is now back in the lineup and averaging 10.3 points in Big Ten play.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Donnal burst onto the scene with a 26-point outing at Illinois on Dec. 30.

“It’s just that I 
haven’t spent 
that much time 
in the spotlight.”

“Mark kicked 
the living hell 
out of them.”
