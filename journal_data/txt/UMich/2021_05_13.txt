Editor’s Note: The following 

article 
contains 
potentially 

triggering accounts and mentions 
of sexual assault

The 
law 
firm 
WilmerHale 

released a report on Tuesday 
summarizing 
their 
year-long 

investigation 
of 
sexual 
abuse 

allegations against Dr. Robert 
Anderson, finding “no doubt” 
that 
hundreds 
of 
allegations 

against Anderson are credible 
and 
represent 
a 
devastating 

pattern of misconduct The report 
tells of Anderson’s misconduct, 
awareness 
of 
Anderson’s 

misconduct at the University, 
and recommendations for the 
University 
“to 
help 
prevent, 

identify, investigate, and respond 
to the kind of misconduct in which 
Dr. Anderson engaged.”

Anderson was first hired as a 

physician at University Health 
System (UHS) in 1966, and was 
promoted to UHS director from 
1968 until 1980, when he resigned 
from his position as director but 
remained a physician at UHS. 
In 1981, Anderson transferred to 
the athletic department, where 
he remained a physician until 
1999. Anderson remained at the 
University as a faculty member 

until 2003.

WilmerHale 
outlined 
three 

main goals in their report: to 
“investigate the nature and scope 
of any misconduct by Dr Anderson 
as a University employee”, to 
“determine who at the University 
knew or should have known 
about such misconduct and what 
was done to address it” and 
to “recommend measures the 
University should take to help 
prevent, detect and address such 
misconduct in the future.” 

More than 300 patients told 

WilmerHale 
about 
Anderson’s 

misconduct in multiple positions 
he held during his 37-year tenure 
at the University. More than 
200 current and former U-M 
employees were interviewed for 
the 
investigation. 
WilmerHale 

additionally 
hired 
medical 

experts 
to 
better 
understand 

relevant standards of care, as 
well as social science experts to 
better understand how and why 
reports of sexual misconduct may 
not be noticed in institutional and 
medical settings.

WilmerHale wrote that the 

investigation 
was 
completely 

independent from the University, 
and that no person or department 
at 
the 
University 
sought 
to 

interfere, influence or impede the 
investigation. They also said that 
they are fully confident in the 
patterns of abuse revealed in the 

investigation because of certain 
behaviors and details that were 
consistent across all interviewed 
patients.

The 
investigation 
outlined 

how exactly Anderson typically 
engaged 
in 
misconduct: 

conducting invasive procedures 
that 
patients 
“perceived 
as 

unnecessary, 
performed 

inappropriately, or both” under 
the guise of legitimate medical 
treatment.

“For example, approximately 

one hundred patients described 
inappropriate prostate or rectal 
examinations; nearly 150 patients 
detailed 
inappropriate 
hernia 

and/or genital examinations; and 
a half-dozen patients told us about 
inappropriate breast and/or pelvic 
examinations,” the report said

Victims 
of 
Anderson’s 

misconduct experienced various 
appalling forms of sexual abuse, 
as reported to WilmerHale and 
DPSS. In 1965 or 1966, one patient 
was instructed to “‘strip down’” 
and “perform jumping jacks while 
naked.” Following the jumping 
jacks, Anderson inappropriately 
performed a prostate exam and 
“‘stroked’ the patient’s penis until 
he ejaculated.” After the patient 
ejaculated, Anderson said, “Nice 
color.”

Independent report finds 37 years of sexual 
abuse by former U-M doctor Robert Anderson

ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM 
michigandaily.com

U-M athletic department 
implicated in Anderson 
sexual misconduct report

The 
law 
firm 
WilmerHale 

released 
an 
independent 

investigation report detailing the 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
against 
former 
University 
of 

Michigan 
physician 
Robert 

Anderson on Tuesday. 

In the 240-page report, former 

Wolverine 
football 
coach 
Bo 

Schembechler was mentioned 10 
times. According to the document, 
numerous former student athletes 
on the football team approached 
Schembechler 
with 
serious 

concerns 
about 
Anderson’s 

behavior. 

One 
former 
student 
athlete 

questioned Schembechler about 
Dr. 
Anderson’s 
methods 
but 

according to the student athlete, 
Schembechler told him to “toughen 
up.” The student athlete told the 
UM Department of Public Safety 
and Security (DPSS) that “you do 
not mess with Bo, and the matter 
was dropped.” 

Another former student athlete 

told DPSS that, “his position coach 
used the threat of an examination 
with Dr. Anderson as a motivational 
tool. (WilmerHale) interviewed the 
coach, who denied the allegation.”

The failure of the Athletic 

Department to protect students 
from abuse by those in authority 
goes beyond the football team. A 
former track athlete alleged that 
former coaches Jack Harvey and 
Ron Warhurst both “‘laughed’ and 
refused” when the student asked 
to see another physician after 
Anderson “(groped) his genitals.” 
Both Harvey and Warhurst deny 
the allegation.

misconduct report against Dr. Anderson. 


Social distancing requirements 

and 
remote 
learning 
have 

substantially 
altered 
previous 

conceptions 
concerning 
how 

education can be accessed by 
students, facilitated by faculty 
and applied beyond the classroom. 
From primary school teachers to 
the deans of graduate programs, 
educators and administrators have 
learned a lesson or two themselves 
about 
adapting 
education 

methodology to best meet the 
needs of their students.

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
spoke 

with teaching faculty from the 
University of Michigan’s various 
schools and colleges about the 
past months of virtual and hybrid 
learning and what they are taking 
away from it all going forward. 

As COVID-19 cases among the 

campus community increased in 
the late fall and into the winter 
term, 
in-person 
learning 
was 

rarely a viable option. However, 
some 
professors 
had 
the 

opportunity to experiment with a 
hybrid classroom in the fall. In this 
format, professors simultaneously 
teach students online and in 
person. Typically, small cohorts 
of students rotate in and out of the 
physical classroom during certain 
days or times to reduce class sizes, 
while the remainder of the class 
attends virtually.

Dennis Oswald, an accounting 

lecturer and visiting assistant 
professor, 
adopted 
a 
hybrid 

teaching style at the start of the 
year. Although hybrid teaching can 
be difficult in practice, Oswald said 
for him, the benefits outweighed 

the 
drawbacks. 
He 
enjoyed 

delivering lectures in person to 
students in a classroom setting.

“I was still teaching in person, 

I was still in a classroom,” Oswald 
said. “I didn’t make a lot of changes 
in terms of the way in which my 
material 
was 
being 
delivered 

because I was still teaching it, just 
I was teaching to a camera (too).”

While Oswald did not have 

to make drastic changes to his 
teaching style, he admits the 
sudden shift to hybrid teaching 
was not ideal.

“I’ve been teaching for 20 

years,”Oswald said. “This is the 
first time I’ve ever had to do 
hybrid, so I didn’t have the skills of 
20 years of hybrid teaching behind 
me.”

The majority of professors at 

the University taught completely 
remote with either synchronous 
live instruction or asynchronous 
pre-recorded activities—or in some 
cases, a mix of both. 

Mary Gell, a lecturer in the 

German department, said she 
switched to remote learning as 
soon as the University sent students 
home last March and has not 
physically taught in the classroom 
since then. She said the transition 
to virtually teaching a foreign 
language was stressful because she 
had to quickly reevaluate how to 
present several aspects of her usual 
curriculum.

“There’s so much to think 

about,” Gell said. “You have to 
rethink your whole course. That’s 
what can be so overwhelming, just 
thinking, ‘how do I have this make 
the most sense for this (online) 
format.’”

What the pandemic has taught 
U-M faculty about virtual learning

Former Ann Arbor coffee shop 

Espresso Royale and boba shop Bubble 
Island both closed in April 2020 due 
to financial constraints caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. David Lin, 
former owner of both of these Ann 
Arbor staples, has since dedicated his 
time to assisting other small businesses 
in the endless fight to remain open and 
continue to generate revenue amid 
changing COVID-19 restrictions. Lin’s 
fundraiser, the COVID Rescue Fund, 
holds the goal of helping to bring back 
100 small businesses across the United 
States through community donations. 

On the fund’s website, visitors are 

able to vote for a small business they 
believe deserves financial assistance. 
Based on the amount of votes they 
receive and their current financial 
situations, businesses can be granted 
up to $100,000 to make up the revenue 
they have lost in the last 14 months. 
These grants are awarded monthly 
based on a variety of eligibility 
requirements, such as having fewer 
than three locations in 2019. 

From his own experiences with 

Bubble Island and Espresso Royale, Lin 
said he has a great deal of empathy for 
similarly struggling business owners. 
Lin said he knows first hand that 
entrepreneurs who have dedicated 
their lives to their establishments can 
be left empty-handed and emotionally 
distraught. 

“Most of these people have been hit 

so hard financially that they don’t have 
resources to go start a new business, 
and their credit might be so destroyed 
that no one will loan the money,” Lin 

said. “So the only outcome for most of 
these people is to go work minimum-
wage jobs, and it’s just a huge mismatch 
of what their talents are, and I think 
that’s a huge tragedy.”

Businesses across the country, from 

dance studios to coffee shops, have 
applied for the potentially life-altering 
grant Lin is offering. Lin highlighted a 
Tae Kwon Do instructor from Texas 
who is on the brink of permanent 
closure of his studio. 

“(The 
instructor) 
has 
trained 

Olympians, he has trained U.S. 
national team members, his son was 
one of the coaches of the U.S. national 
team,” Lin said. “He’s been doing this 
his whole life, and his dojo is about to 
go out of business. We need to help 
people like that, who are excellent at 
what they do, get back to work so they 
can be productive and help society.”

One of the fund’s current featured 

applicants is Ann Arbor’s very own 
aUM Yoga, which formerly had studios 
on North University Avenue and South 
University Avenue. The owner, Jessie 
Lipkowitz, is a University of Michigan 
alum who is deeply invested in the 
Ann Arbor community. Lipkowitz 
said she hopes to receive a grant from 
the COVID Rescue Fund in order 
to continue to provide a space for 
improving health and wellness in Ann 
Arbor.

“I care wholeheartedly about the 

demographics that I work with and the 
communities that I serve,” Lipkowitz 
said. “I do a lot of community work 
through the yoga studio, and I hope 
that I’m given an opportunity so that I 
can continue the mission statement of 
this business.”

Faculty have had to adapt to new teaching methods. 

JARETT ORR/Daily

David Lin hopes to bring back 100 small businesses. 


The 
Michigan 
House 

Appropriations 
Committee 

released a proposal on Monday 
to 
change 
how 
the 
state 

allocates 
funding 
to 
public 

colleges and universities. The 
proposed 
legislation 
would 

assign 
operational 
funding 

increases to universities based 
on student population instead of 
six performance metrics. This 
would effectively redistribute 
money from the University of 
Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus 
and 
other 
institutions 
that 

previously 
received 
large 

performance 
increases 
to 

universities that received lower 
increases but have comparable 
student body sizes, including the 
University of Michigan’s Flint 
and Dearborn campuses. 

The 
Republican-led 
House 

Appropriations 
Committee 

released the draft as part of 
the ongoing budget negotiation 
process that began Feb. 11 when 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer first 
presented her budget proposal 
for fiscal year 2022 to the state 
legislature. 
Legislators 
must 

send their finalized budget for 
Whitmer to sign by July 1, as the 
new fiscal year starts Oct. 1.

The 
proposal 
would 
alter 

the 
distribution 
formula 
for 

state 
appropriations, 
which 

currently 
determines 
annual 

increases to funding at public 
universities based on a number of 
performance metrics including 
research 
expenditures, 
six-

year graduation rates and total 
degree completions. Under the 
new House proposal, the funding 
each university receives would 
instead be determined by the size 
of the student body, with each 
student earning their university 
an average of $6,299. 

If passed, the University of 

Michigan-Ann 
Arbor 
would 

receive 12.2% less state funding 
— about a $40 million decrease — 
in fiscal year 2022. Meanwhile, 
some 
institutions 
that 
have 

traditionally received less state 
money in the past, including the 
University 
of 
Michigan-Flint 

and the University of Michigan-
Dearborn, would receive a 10% 
increase — about $2.5 million for 
each campus.

The 
Appropriations 

Committee 
capped 
increases 

in funding at 10% for each 
university. A May 4 version 
of the bill released by the 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee 

on 
Higher 
Education 
and 

Community Colleges did not 
include the cap, and universities 
received funding increases as 
high as 33%. The recent proposal 
would take any increases larger 
than 10% and reallocate those 
funds 
to 
universities 
who 

saw smaller increases or even 
decreases in the subcommittee 
proposal. If that proposal had 
passed, the Ann Arbor campus 
would have lost over 13% of its 
2020-21 funding.

Whitmer’s proposed budget 

called for the state to increase 
higher education funding by 
over $29 million. Each university 
would be given a one-time 2% 
increase 
over 
its 
FY2020-21 

funding. The House proposal 
would 
remove 
the 
one-time 

increase, 
funding 
only 
the 

mandatory increase in funding 
for the state’s Michigan Indian 
Tuition Waiver program, which 
waives tuition for eligible Native 
American students.

Funding based on student 

enrollment, 
also 
known 
as 

formula 
funding, 
has 
been 

criticized 
in 
the 
past 
for 

incentivizing high enrollment 
rates rather than encouraging 
high-quality education.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel wrote in a letter to 
House 
Appropriations 
Chair 

Thomas Albert, R-Lowell, that 
if passed, the proposal would 
hurt the University’s ability to 
provide quality education to 
lower-income 
Michiganders 

through financial aid programs 
such as the Go Blue Guarantee.

“Michigan 
ranks 
below 

the 
national 
average 
in 

postsecondary degree attainment 
and 33rd in median household 
income,” Schlissel wrote. “This 
is not coincidental. The data have 
shown consistently that workers 
with higher levels of education 
earn higher wages, yet Michigan 
ranks 44th in per-capita support 
for higher education.”

Albert was not immediately 

available for comment at the time 
of publication.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

Over 700 University of Michigan 

instructors 
are 
calling 
on 
the 

University to mandate COVID-19 
vaccinations for all students attending 
in-person classes next fall, as well as 
all employees, according to a petition 
that began circulating Wednesday. 
If the University does not institute a 
mandate, the petition requests that 
any instructor be able to opt out of 
in-person teaching and engagement 
with students. The petition cites 
the 228 peer institutions that have 
mandated vaccines for the upcoming 
school year, 76 of which are public.

“We are concerned that students 

who refuse to be vaccinated may be 
overrepresented among our incoming 
class precisely because we do not 
mandate vaccination, while students 
and parents who are concerned about 
COVID safety would prefer to attend a 
school with more safety precautions,” 
the petition reads.

The instructors petition that the 

hypothetical vaccination requirement 
go into effect on the first day of Fall 
2021 classes if the FDA has given full 
approval to at least one COVID-19 
vaccine by then. Pfizer is expected 
to file by the end of May for full FDA 
approval. 

The instructors are also petitioning 

for exemptions to in-person teaching 
regardless of a vaccine mandate for 
those with unvaccinated children, 
citing expectations that the FDA will 
likely not approve vaccines for young 
children until the end of 2021 at the 
earliest. This request also stems from 
the concern that faculty will still face 
some pandemic-related issues such 
as childcare and/or family members 
with 
underlying 
conditions, 
the 

petition says. 

The 
instructors 
suggest 
only 

the University only grants vaccine 
exemptions required by law.

“Any person who is not vaccinated 

endangers the community, especially 
those who are prevented from getting 
vaccinated for medical reasons,” the 
petition reads. “The approach used 
by the State of Michigan for K-12 
should be used as a guide: The state 
requires childhood immunization 
for those who attend public schools, 
and parents who claim a non-medical 
exemption are required to meet with a 
health educator.”

The University announced in 

March that the vast majority of small 
and medium-sized classes would 

be delivered in-person. The petition 
claims one of the University’s schools 
had indicated courses would be hybrid 
or virtual before changing the format 
to in-person without the consent or 
knowledge of the instructors. It also 
states that instructors at another 
school were given the choice between 
teaching 
in-person 
and 
taking 

medical leave.

Lastly, the petition calls for the 

University to “provide full financial 
support for each school to test and 
repair ventilation systems in their 
respective classrooms to ensure safe/
sufficient ventilation for instruction.” 

The petition comes just weeks 

after the University announced a 
vaccination requirement for students 
living in on-campus housing for the 
fall semester. Oakland University is so 
far the only other college in Michigan 
to announce any such requirement.

In an email to The Daily, U-M 

spokesperson 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 

wrote that while the University is 
continuing to strongly encourage all 

members of the campus community 
to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, 
the University currently has no plans 
to institute a campus-wide vaccine 
mandate beyond the requirement 
for residence halls. Fitzgerald wrote 
students and employees who do not 
get a vaccination will be subjected to 
similar virus mitigation strategies that 
were implemented in the Winter 2021 
semester (such as weekly COVID-19 
testing).

“We remain confident that as 

we progress together toward a 
residential 
fall 
term 
experience 

with most classes offered with 
in-person instruction, we will have 
a sufficiently high percentage of our 
community vaccinated.” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “Encouragement may be more 

effective than a mandate to achieve 
the goal of maximizing vaccinations 
against COVID-19 in the months 
ahead.”

Fitzgerald further explained the 

University’s thought process for only 
requiring vaccinations for students in 
on-campus housing.

“We do not require students to live 

in residence halls, so students who 
object have other options,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “Also, the public health 
benefits of a vaccinated residence hall 
community are compelling because of 
the densely populated conditions of 
residence-hall living.”

Fitzgerald also noted an effort in 

the Michigan Legislature seeking 
to prohibit public universities from 
requiring vaccinations to enroll or 
attend classes.

“While we oppose such a measure, 

we must respect the legislative process 
as it plays out,” Fitzgerald wrote.

After choosing to receive the 

vaccine, 
LSA 
freshman 
Emma 

Kortmansky expressed excitement 

as she prepares to attend in-person 
classes for the first time this upcoming 
fall semester.

“In the fall, there are going to be a 

lot of changes with students attending 
classes in person for the first time,” 
Kortmansky said. “I think it is really 
important that everyone attending 
classes or in person activities is 
vaccinated to protect everyone on 
campus, especially those at high risk.”

In an interview in March with The 

Daily, U-M President Mark Schlissel 
displayed optimism about the fall 
semester and said that much of what 
the fall semester will look like will 
depend on how many students are 
vaccinated.

OPINION

A

s a child, I assumed I would 
be a much more interesting 
college student than I really 

am. I thought life would be full of 
swashbuckling 
adventures 
and 

huge declarations of love — with 
a few musical numbers thrown in, 
of course. Now, I view existence 
differently: I’ve fallen in love with 
the mundanity and meaninglessness 
of the world around me. 

I don’t dislike having a “boring” 

life — I value tranquility. The 
moments I remember are the quiet 
ones: watching the clouds drift by, 
trading hesitant laughs with soon-
to-be-not-strangers and gazing out 
the window on long drives with 
my mother. I expect my “future” to 
become more boring: I’ll work a 
mediocre nine-to-five job to support 
myself, take my dog for walks and 
read. Genuinely, I can’t wait. 

As I grow older and days slip by 

at startling speeds, I can’t help but 
notice how my life is, for lack of a 
better word, unremarkable. This 
seems especially true when I speak 
to my friends, who all effortlessly bag 
internships, maintain their 4.0 grade 
point averages and travel voraciously 
around the world — all of which 
is faithfully documented on social 
media. I suppose it makes sense; 
the communities many of us come 
from are filled with expectations of 
medical school, McMansions and 
the (false) meritocracy. It prides the 
fruits of “productivity” above all else. 
I would be considered a failure by 
any of these standards — I haven’t 
given my parents much to brag about.

However, I don’t think of myself 

as a failure, and I don’t think of 
anyone as a failure. Recently, I’ve 
begun reading basic philosophy. I 
know, another classic college kid 
trying to philosophize their way 
out of existential dilemmas while 
having fake-deep conversations in 
their residence hall room. But hear 

me out: I refuse to ascribe meaning 
and purpose to existence. 

Nihilism, 
absurdism 
and 

existentialism are three similar 
schools of thought you might be 
familiar with. They all operate 
under the same basic principle — 
that life has no meaning — but have 
notable differences. As someone 
who has anxiety, embracing the 
meaningless and the mundane 
was the kindest thing I could do 
for myself. I used to spend nights 
awake agonizing about the past, 
being anxious about the future I felt 
locked into and figuring out how 
to finish the puzzle of what I was 
supposed to be. Especially during 
the pandemic, when my world 
became confined to my residence 
hall room, I felt so overwhelmed by 
anxiety that my hands often shook 
with fear. Put simply, I needed 
to “touch grass” to be reminded 
of my insignificance. Thus, after 
a breaking point, I decided to 
reevaluate my worldview.

After 
researching 
different 

schools of thought, nihilism, which 
says that existence is completely 
meaningless and therefore futile, 
seemed like the obvious choice 
for further research. However, 
upon discovering that all three 
philosophies are also known for 
their lack of societally accepted 
“morality,” I felt lost again. As much 
as I wanted to abandon all concern 
for the conventions of societal 
existence, I was hesitant to fully 
accept these philosophies. I believe 
in the importance of treating others 
with kindness and a general concept 
of socially accepted “morality” — 
whatever that could mean. 

L

ike many American students, 
I grew up being told by 
my parents that attending 

college was not optional — it was 
mandatory. Because of this, I had 
no plan B for what to do after high 
school. My parents believed in 
the power of education to serve as 
a vessel of social mobility and to 
provide me and my siblings with a 
more fulfilling life than we would 
have otherwise had. The question 
of whether college is still worth it, 
especially with the rise in student 
debt and increasing tuition costs, is 
hotly debated. After a few minutes 
of scrolling through any social media 
platform, you will find an abundance 
of day traders, entrepreneurs and 
influencers claiming that college 
is a waste of time. Even Elon 
Musk has questioned whether the 
workforce needs college graduates. 
As a recent college graduate who 
has often contemplated the value 
of my University of Michigan 
undergraduate 
degree, 
I 
can 

confidently answer that yes, college 
is still worth it. 

While there are people like 

Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark 
Zuckerberg who have led extremely 
successful careers without earning 
a college degree, their stories are 
exceptions to the rule. For the 
average person, earning a college 
degree, 
including 
a 
two-year 

degree, results in higher annual 
earnings, a lower chance of being 
unemployed, a lower chance of 
living in poverty and higher job 

satisfaction compared to those 
with no postsecondary education. 
Additionally, the median annual 
earnings has continued to climb 
for people with Bachelor’s degrees, 
while 
those 
without 
are 
not 

experiencing these increases. 

Of course, there are people who 

have been financially successful 
without going to college, but if the 
pandemic economy and the Great 
Recession 
taught 
us 
anything, 

it’s how insecure the job market 
is. While business ventures may 
fall apart, a college degree never 
expires. Whether it is ethical to judge 
someone’s abilities or intellect based 
on a college degree is a separate 
issue. From an economic standpoint, 
a college education can be one of 
the greatest investments a person 
makes. There are caveats, including 
the long-term return-on-investment 
when 
high 
student 
debts 
are 

considered, but overall, there is still 
clear evidence that a college degree 
is worth it. 

The financial benefits of a 

college degree are not the only 
things that make college worth 
it. We often treat college as a 
means to an end — typically a 
high-paying job — but there is so 
much more we can take away from 
the experience. College provides 
an abundance of opportunities 
that give us new passions, new 
skills and new perspectives. Clubs, 
Fraternity & Sorority Life and 
on-campus job opportunities give 
students the ability to explore 

new and varied interests in a way 
they wouldn’t be able to otherwise. 
Student organizations can serve 
as creative outlets, opportunities 
for humanitarian activities and 
resources for developing skills that 
are vital in and out of the workforce. 

The skills we learn and develop 

in college are necessary for every 
aspect of life. Embedded in college 
curriculums are the coursework 
and projects which provide tools 
that help us navigate the world. 
Though I hated each and every 
one of the presentations I had to 
give in front of a lecture hall filled 
with my peers, I developed the 
ability to effectively communicate 
big ideas concisely to a variety of 
audiences. Even though group 
projects are usually dreaded, they 
provide the perfect opportunity 
to progress our ability to work 
with others and manage multiple 
tasks 
simultaneously. 
The 

exorbitant amount of reading 
and writing that is required for 
many classes expands our ability 
to problem solve, think critically 
and analytically and identify the 
main points of an argument. If 
any of those sound like lines from 
a job posting, it’s because those are 
the skills employers want and that 
colleges provide. 

Nothing matters, hopefully

Yes, college is still worth it

I 

once had an interaction with my 
high school physics teacher that 
has stuck with me ever since. Dur-

ing one of the weekly chats we’d have 
in her classroom after school, I won-
dered out loud why neither evolution 
nor the Big Bang theory were covered 
in the biology or physics curricula. My 
teacher explained to me that being in 
a town drenched in parochial ideol-
ogy, there was a don’t ask, don’t tell 
policy covering the teaching of evolu-
tion. Science instructors were encour-
aged to not teach the subject and to 
only field questions when asked. While 
not surprising to me in light of the cul-
ture of my hometown — Ortonville, 
Mich. — it was infuriating to know 
that social pressure was pushing my 
science teachers to avoid evolution in 
their general science courses. No law 
was restricting them. Only the fear of 
becoming a social pariah was in the 
way of them providing students with a 
scientifically complete education. 

What is happening in my hometown 

is not an anomaly in the contemporary 
United States. A 2019 survey reported 
that only 67% of public high school biol-
ogy teachers present Charles Darwin’s 
theory of evolution by natural selec-
tion as the scientific consensus. This 
is an increase from past surveys, but 
still quite low given that the theory of 
evolution is one of the most champi-

oned theories in all of biology. One out 
of every three teachers is not portray-
ing evolution by natural selection as 
the robust scientific theory that it is 
— a theory that has been fortified with 
new evidence every year since it was 
first proposed. This presents obstacles 
to students who wish to further their 
science education at postsecondary 
institutions. More worrisome is that 
evolution denial propagates ignorance 
and scientific illiteracy — issues all the 
more pertinent in light of the COVID-
19 pandemic. 

Legal prohibitions on the public 

instruction of evolutionary theory do 
not hold anymore, but teachers’ appre-
hension about teaching evolution as 
agreed-upon science indicates that 
traditionalist mores still weigh down 
the American public education system. 
Bans on teaching evolution in public 
schools is as old as the theory itself. One 
of the first major conflicts between 
scientific educators and conservative 
policy makers in U.S. history was the 
Scopes Trial of 1925. This legal case 
concerned a Tennessee public school 
teacher who taught evolutionary the-
ory despite a Tennessee law prohibit-
ing instruction of human evolution in 
any school that received state funding. 
This trial catalyzed the debate between 
creationism and evolutionary theory. 
From then on, legal challenges to the 

instruction of evolution and natural 
selection in public schools have been 
mounted by many Christian groups 
— usually those from evangelical tradi-
tions — with varying degrees of success. 

Now, I cannot criticize those 1920s 

Tennessee creationist policy makers 
too virulently, as at that time evolution 
was not a majority-held belief among 
Christians nor society at large. But crit-
icism is warranted for contemporary 
teachers and education boards who 
are still reluctant to teach evolutionary 
theory and natural selection in light of 
the now 160 years of evidence — includ-
ing the crucial discovery of DNA and 
genes — that provide robust support for 
evolution. 

And while I understand that some 

regions of the country have intense 
negative social sanctions against anti-
creationist rhetoric that can be hard 
for teachers to overcome, it is more 
important that teachers plan science 
curriculum around empirical obser-
vations than socially-pressured tradi-
tional beliefs. 

This is not to say that learning about 

religious practice has no room in edu-
cation — just that it does not belong in 
scientific curriculum at the expense 
of silencing scientific fact. A more 
apt place would be in the domain of 
social studies, with an emphasis on 
the diversity of religious practice. But 

having evolutionary theory not pre-
sented to students within their sci-
ence courses promotes widespread 
ignorance and scientific illiteracy, 
two issues detrimental if a soci-
ety wishes to better itself. Denying 
students the knowledge that many 
biologists view as foundational to 
their discipline serves ideology much 
more than it serves education. If the 
American educational system is to 
ever become the best it can be, a thor-
ough vetting of educational policies 
has to be conducted. Creationism can 
be taught to students as one of many 
spiritual beliefs, but not as empirical 
fact. Censoring evolution in favor of 
creationism in public education not 
only sustains ignorance, but is a vio-
lation of the civil liberties of freedom 
of religion guaranteed in the Consti-
tution, as the teaching of creationism 
as fact promotes a Christian-centric 
ideology within the walls of an insti-
tution of the state.

While the trend is moving in the 

right direction, more teachers must 
embrace evolution by natural selection 
as a well supported scientific theory 
instead of tacitly mentioning it or not 
even discussing the subject. Parts of the 
U.S. education system are hell-bent on 
sustaining a pre-Scopes trial evangeli-
cal worldview. Again, the pushback of 
1920s creationists is not without war-

rant as the debate over fundamental-
ism and modernity were in their infant 
stages. However, for teachers and edu-
cation boards to still deny evolution in 
the 21st century is downright asinine. 
This will only lead to continued igno-
rance among the American public. If the 
United States wants to keep progressing, 
Americans must first reckon with the 
rejection of fact that is occurring within 
their educational institutions.

I

t’s Dec. 19, 2019, 11 p.m. Indian 
Standard Time, and the early 
action decisions for the Univer-

sity of Michigan undergraduate class 
of 2024 aren’t out yet. I’m not super-
stitious, but the last few times I stayed 
up to wait for an application result, I 
received a rejection. All of them stated 
how “large this year’s applicant pool 
was” and how they “couldn’t accept 
all of the talented people who applied.” 
I also have school the next day, so I call 
it a night. A few hours later, I wake to 
the sound of my parents bursting in to 
tell me that the result came out. I got 
in! 

March rolls around, and with it 

comes an almost overwhelming bout 
of senioritis. I spend hours reading 
about campus life — about the differ-
ent residence halls in the cardinal-
direction quadrangles, the apparently 
cockroach-infested Mary Markley 
Residence Hall (mental note: avoid 
Markley at all costs!), the libraries 
with nicknames like the “UGLi” and 

the “Dude” and outdoor spaces like 
“the Arb.” These daydreams sadly coin-
cide with my high school’s final exams. 
After a quick search and panic about 

rescinding offers, my focus returns to 
my studies. 

Then, this novel virus that had 

seemed too distant to cause any 
trouble hits home. India goes into a 
nationwide lockdown two days before 
my last exam. Just like that, we enter 
a state of limbo, learning more with 
each passing day. As someone who 
only vaguely remembers the 2009 
H1N1 pandemic, I watch in horror as 
stories of overwhelmed hospitals and 

mass graves spread online. Masks, 
hand sanitizer and social distancing 
are all part of the new normal. Amid 
this chaos, the University still has in-
person course listings for the fall. A 
nagging voice tells me that surely we 
wouldn’t be in person come August.

Orientation rolls around. The 

guides emphatically proclaim that 
“college is what you make of it!” None-
theless, rumor has it that instruction 
might be mostly, if not completely, vir-
tual. I have to create a schedule that 
will be doable regardless of whether 
I’m in Ann Arbor or Bangalore. I set-
tle for a course load that won’t be too 
early for an in-person semester or too 
late if I stayed home. 

A few days later, the courses are 

updated to reflect their new, virtual 
status. Reality truly sinks in when I 
cancel my housing contract, know-
ing then that there is no turning back. 
A few months later, freshman year 
starts at my desk while awkwardly 
engaging in Zoom icebreakers.

Now, on the other side of my vir-

tual freshman year, I’m still thinking 
about a few questions that I, like many 
others, have wrestled with since start-
ing class: What can I make of college 
without being in college? What does it 
mean to be a Wolverine?

Is it in academics? I had newfound 

freedom in crafting my course sched-
ule this year. My classes challenged 
me in a way that I had never experi-
enced before. I was exposed to new 
ideas, new pedagogical methods and 
incredible peers. At the same time, I 
experienced these things at either 3 
a.m. or via sets of pre-recorded videos. 

Maybe it lies in the many student 

organizations and clubs. I heard of 
events like Festifall and Winterfest, 
featuring hundreds of clubs. Typi-
cally, they would be ripe examples of 
how each student individualizes their 
experience. However, they held vir-
tual meetings at times inaccessible to 
me. Then again, I applied on a whim 
to The Michigan Daily and now find 

myself in the middle of another col-
umn.

I am an avid sports fan. Perhaps 

sports are the secret ingredient? I 
remember hearing about the magic 
atmosphere on campus during game 
days, be it in tailgating or joining thou-
sands of fans in the Big House. COVID-
19 ensured that none of that happened. 

The pandemic couldn’t, however, 

stop me from following Michigan bas-
ketball. I was delighted when we beat 
the Ohio State University in Colum-
bus, Ohio. I was exasperated with the 
University of Illinois over their efforts 
to undermine our regular-season 
championship. I was gutted when Isa-
iah Livers became injured just before 
March Madness. All for a sport, mind 
you, I had never watched regularly 
before this year.

My passion for baking started at a 

very young age. I can’t tell you about 
the very first time I ever baked because 
I quite honestly don’t remember, but I 
do remember what became a weekly 
ritual at my house starting when I was 
about five years old. Every Sunday, 
my dad and I spent our afternoons in 
the kitchen whipping up some sort 
of dessert. As he and I sped through 
our tiny kitchen, my sisters blasted 
Nancy Ajram (only one of the most 
iconic Arabic singers) in the living 
room while my brothers played video 
games and my mother tried to remain 
ahead of of the disaster the kitchen 
would soon become. It was beautiful 
chaos. We measured, whipped, mixed, 
frosted and sprinkled our way through 
our Sunday. But do not be fooled. After 
all our efforts, we were always left 
with nothing more than a prepared 
Betty Crocker vanilla cake mix that 
was topped with heaping amounts of 
pink frosting and rainbow sprinkles. 
But, in my five-year-old eyes, it was 

worth more than the entire world. 
My affinity for baking grew with me 
throughout the years, and I often 
think back to those Sunday afternoons 
with feelings of nostalgia as I consider 
what initially set my love for baking 
into motion. 

After informally taking orders 

from customers all over Ann Arbor 
for years, I launched my independent 
baking business, Confections by Reem, 
during the summer before my senior 
year of high school. I was motivated 
by a mixture of boredom and finally 
pulled the trigger on something I 
had wanted to do professionally for 
years — but it was no smooth-sailing 
journey. As any small-business owner 
would, I experienced great highs but 
also very low lows. There were times 
when I absolutely thrived and reached 
heights I never thought I could, and 
there were times I failed. Over time, 
I watched my order counts double, 
triple and even lead me to book out 
full weekends. Simultaneously, I 
watched my social media presence 
grow and gain more traction within 
my community and beyond. These, as 
well as countless other achievements, 

were highs. However, things like 
the occasional failed cake or various 
attempts to navigate the complexity of 
Instagram marketing with its forever-
changing algorithm seemed to drown 
out all previous joy and pride. 

Running my small business spurred 

and intensified notions about myself 
that I never knew I had. Through all 
the roses and thorns, one persisted: 
I never felt qualified or worthy to 
be in my position. I didn’t feel like I 
deserved the title of “entrepreneur” 
or “small-business owner” and quite 
honestly felt like my achievements 
were more of a product of luck 
rather than my own hard work. I 
allowed my minor failures to define 
my capabilities and refrained from 
talking about my business to strangers 
and even friends and family. But at 
the same time, I also could not help 
but question the paradox in my own 
struggle: How could I be hyperaware 
of the fact that I was doing so well with 
my business yet still approach it with 
so much self-doubt? Out of frustration, 
I connected with other small-business 
owners on Instagram, particularly 
those who carried similar identities 

as me and were in the same field as 
me. By interacting with these like-
minded women of color and hearing 
their experiences, I discovered that 
my feelings were purely a result 
of imposter syndrome. People of 
color, some of who carry multiple 
marginalized identities, are prone to 
experiencing an increased sense of 
imposter syndrome. Connecting with 
these small-business owners helped 
me understand these insecurities 
but also motivated me to fight back 
against them. I actively sought to 
minimize the extent to which I allow 
my imposter syndrome to stunt the 
growth and potential of my business. 
Easier said than done? Most definitely. 
I would be lying if I said that my 
impostorism has disappeared entirely 
because every day is a constant battle. 
I began by implementing small goals 
in my everyday actions and thoughts. 
While I initially found it challenging 
to refer someone to my page, I now 
shamelessly plug my business in any 
social setting and rant about the work 
I do to any person who is willing 
to listen. And although I initially 
struggled with delegating and asking 

for help when I needed it, I now take 
full advantage of any resource that I 
cross paths with. 

I take immense pride in the fact 

that I am an entrepreneur of color. 
By recognizing my self-worth and 
my business’ potential, I regained 
excitement to do what I do, and it has 
even managed to spill over into other 
spheres of my life.

When I arrived in Ann Arbor 

in January, I embarked on a quest 
to survive my second semester of 
college. Along my epic journey, I 
faced powerful foes such as Calculus 
2 and second year-level Japanese. 
Night after night, I crossed swords 
with Taylor polynomials and kanji 
characters. Despite several defeats 
over the course of the semester, I 
vanquished my last final exams 
and claimed the ultimate treasure, 

an ancient relic I had long since 
forgotten: free time. Immediately 
after my Calc 2 final, I swiftly exited 
Gradescope and navigated over to 
Steam; it was time I enjoyed myself 
with a good video game after months 
of non-stop work. Combing through 
my backlog of games, I stumbled 
across “Omori,” a psychological 
horror game set in a deceptively 
bright and colorful, nostalgic, 8-bit 
fantasy 
world 
brimming 
with 

amusing characters and heartfelt 
moments.

I bought Omori just a few days 

after its release after seeing a video 

showing the game’s cute art style 
on Tiktok. I had anticipated the 
game’s horror elements from its 
description on Steam; nevertheless 
I was still a little shocked when 
my player character began in a 
sparse, eerie white room called 
Whitespace. After poking around 
the area and obtaining a knife as a 
weapon, a door became accessible 
and let me venture through the 
world with other friendly characters 
I met. The pastel world design 
and charming characters were so 
adorable that I pretty much forgot 
that this was a horror game. And 
because I was familiar with the 
fairly simple combat system found 
in other turn-based role-playing 
games like “Pokémon,” I was 
immediately 
comfortable 
with 

Omori. As a result, I never wondered 
why there was an inaccessible menu 
option labelled “???” on the top-left 
corner of my screen (Since I was still 
in the tutorial, I figured this would 
be a normal tool that would open up 
to me later). And when my character 
learned a combat skill bluntly 
labelled “stab,” I never viewed it as 
anything more than a basic element 

One Friday morning, as I exited 

my anatomy class, a tall brunette 
with a black backpack nudged me 
and asked, “Wait, you listen to The 
Moth?” I was taken aback because 
I was in fact listening to an episode 
of “The Moth Radio Hour” podcast. 
“The Moth” was founded in 1997 by 
novelist George Dawes Green, “who 
wanted to recreate in New York the 
feeling of sultry summer evenings 
in his native Georgia, when moths 
were attracted to the light on the 
porch where he and his friends 
would gather to spin spellbinding 
tales.” “The Moth” holds a variety 
of events from “StorySLAMs,” 
an open-mic setting where any 
attendees can tell a story in front of 
a small audience, to the “Mainstage,” 
where tellers spend time with 
producers from “The Moth” to 
develop their stories and curate them 
for a large audience. The podcast 
features selected stories recorded at 
those events with commentary from 
the hosts as well as behind-the-scenes 
details. 

That day, The Moth’s logo was 

visible on my phone — sparking 
a conversation between us about 
“The Moth,” our love for stories and 
why storytelling is so important 
to us. We spoke about our favorite 
episodes and shared more podcast 
recommendations with each other. 
She loved the Ed Gavagan episodes, 
where he speaks about a horrific 
stabbing accident he went through 
and its aftermath. I recommended to 
her my favorites: Moran Cerf’s story 
in “The Call” and Janna Levin’s 
“Life on a Möbius Strip.” After that, 
I would go on to attend different 
StorySLAMs, become a Hall Of 
Flame member, even pitch my own 
story to “The Moth” and continue 
listening till this day. 

I have always been interested 

in 
people’s 
stories 
and 
lived 

experiences. To deal with my culture 
shock after moving here from 
Syria, my first steps of acclimating 
consisted of observing people’s 
behavior around me and writing 
about things that seemed different, 
new and strange to me. I remember 
one of the first things that puzzled 
me is how students behaved in the 
classroom.

The bitter gourd dances across 

the sharp blade of a mandolin, 
uniform slices falling from the 
vegetable and landing silently on 
the cutting board below. Its gator-
like, green skin flashes brightly 
against the utensil’s yellow plastic. 
With every stroke, the vegetable 
gets smaller and smaller, until I 
hold just the stubby stem in my 
hand. 

Karela, or bitter gourd in English, 

is a controversial vegetable. Most 
people don’t like its sour taste or 
ragged exterior, but my siblings and 
I love it — so did my grandfather. It 
smells like clean water and eating 
it makes my mouth pucker, but in a 
good way. After frying in hot oil for 
half an hour, the slices shrivel like 
spinach and become crispy on the 
outside but stay soft on the inside. 

I love karela, but I hate the seeds. 

They are more bitter than the 
vegetable itself and are practically 
pebble-like when cooked. 

English is my second language. 

Because of this, I didn’t learn how to 
write properly or put my thoughts 
into coherent English words until 
the end of elementary school, and 
even then I still struggled immensely. 
Before moving from Urbana, Illinois 
to Dearborn, Michigan, my brothers 
and I were the only Arabs at my 
elementary school. During first grade, 
I would always beg my mama to stop 
packing the wild thyme and olive oil 
sandwiches she would wake up early 
to make for me. Instead, I would ask for 
a peanut butter grape jelly sandwich 
(even though I hated the taste of 
grape jelly) because I couldn’t find the 
English words to explain the “green 
oily stuff” to my classmates when I 
took it out at lunch. When third grade 
rolled around and classmates wanted 
to have playdates with me, I pleaded 
with my baba to take down the wheat 
woven trays and calligraphy pieces 
hung up on the walls of our home 
and replace them with family picture 
frames and “normal” paintings. At 
school talent shows and science fairs, 
I would inwardly cringe at my mama’s 

broken English as she greeted my 
friends and would quickly change the 
subject at the mere sound of my baba’s 
“Ana fakhour fiki.” I would have much 
rathered the regular “I’m proud of 
you’s” everyone else was receiving. 

By the time I was a fifth grader, I 

never fully understood the extent of 
what I was giving up to fit in with my 
classmates, not until I sauntered back 
inside one summer night after picking 
mint from my mama’s prized mini 
herb garden, which reminded her of 
home. The garden filled with aromatic 
greens was complimented by all our 
neighbors when she’d offer them the 
fragrant samples. With her improved 
yet still imperfect English, she’d 
instruct, “Drink with tea” or “Sprinkle 
on chicken” — all paired with her 
pleased smile. Coming back into the 
house, I found my parents resting as 
my three brothers were throwing a 
ball around the sacred guest living 
room filled with priceless, fragile 
pieces, each with a half-finished 
mango drink on the table. My baba’s 
cup of evening tea awaited the fresh 
mint leaves I carried in my basket as 
the sage we had dried and stored the 
night before sank to the bottom of 
my mama’s cup. My eyes scanned the 
room and finally landed on my mama’s 

as if asking “this must be huge if you’re 
allowing Ali, Ahmed and Amin to step 
foot into the precious guest room and 
aimlessly toss a ball around as their 
mango juice itches to be spilled.” Her 
simple nod left me in a puzzled state, 
but I went to wash the mint leaves. 
Walking back with my own mango 
drink, I handed my dad the mint. He 
took a sip of his tea and dropped the 
bomb: we were moving.

After the initial shock had passed 

and many tear-filled conversations 
with my mom, I eventually came to 
accept the move. Packing the few 
books I had into one of many boxes, I 
could barely remember a thing about 
my classmates or their lives for that 
matter. “No one will miss me, they 
won’t even know I left” I convinced 
myself. Boy did I speak that one into 
reality because on July 4, 2013, all 
of my family’s life possessions were 
packed into a UHAUL and we were on 
our way to Michigan. I quickly came to 
realize the beauty behind the madness 
of uprooting and starting new as not a 
“friend” came to say goodbye.

Three months later, as I arrived at 

the steps of my new school for the first 
time, I wasn’t sure what to expect. 
My heart was racing as I walked 
through the front doors. On my way 

to my first class, the hallways were 
bustling with noise and I could faintly 
make out some Arabic greetings and 
jokes in the process. Walking into my 
math class, I was stunned, thinking, 
They’re speaking Arabic in school? 
Why would they do that — aren’t they 
afraid people will make fun of them? 
An assigned seat chart was taped to 
the wall and I could see my name 
near the back row, sitting next to a 
girl whose name sounded Arabic too. 
As a matter of fact, most of the kids in 
my class were Arab themselves and 
even though they didn’t know me like 
their childhood friends, they were all 
so funny and kind and welcoming. 
From math to language arts to history 
to science class, there were a plethora 
of Arabic words casually being used. 
Even some of the teachers slipped a 
few in as they introduced themselves 
and went over their syllabi. 

My table partner didn’t show up 

that first week because she was still 
visiting her family overseas, but on the 
day that she came back, I walked into 
class to find “The Mark of Athena” on 
my desk and “The Son of Neptune” on 
hers. She apologized and stacked them 
both on her desk, introducing herself 
as Zeinab. I commented on how 
carrying all that book weight probably 

meant she had some serious muscle 
gains and she laughed and told me all 
about how much the “Percy Jackson 
& the Olympians” series had changed 
her life over the summer. She spent so 
much time in Lebanon reading instead 
of enjoying the scenery and food, that 
her mother thought she was taking 
summer classes. By lunch time, we 
had figured out our schedules were 
identical and she introduced me to her 
friends. They were all on a different 
point in the series, pleading with 
Zeinab not to spoil the next book for 
them. The shine in their eyes as they 
discussed the contents of the series 
with me, their descriptions laced with 
the slightest hint of an enthralling life-
changing experience motivated me as 
I skipped lunch with them to peruse 
the school library’s odd assortment of 
books. Excitedly, I checked out their 
recommendation of the first book in 
the series, “The Lightning Thief.” As 
the end of the school day drew near, 
Zeinab expressed how wonderful it 
had been to meet me and how she was 
looking forward to discussing more 
about Percy Jackson tomorrow. On 
my way home with my mama, I was 
nearly jumping in my seat, happier 
than ever. I proudly explained to my 
mom in Arabic, I finally belonged. 

I have been using makeup ever 

since I was in fourth grade. In reality, 
I did not have much of a choice since 
my dance teacher required it for 
our performances. My mother was 
never a fan of this idea, but I didn’t 
really mind it. I liked wearing it. I 
would spend my free time watching 
tutorials 
and 
reviews, 
making 

desperate 
attempts 
to 
recreate 

looks with the few products on my 
mother’s vanity. It was only when I 
entered high school that my mother 
would let me buy my own makeup 
instead of using hers.

Out of a sense of newfound 

independence 
and 
excitement, 

I started shopping for products 
through websites and in stores. 
I would spend hours browsing 
through 
each 
foundation 
and 

concealer shade, reading off their 
pretty names: Cloud, Swan, Snow, 
Pearl, Porcelain, Seashell… But all 
this did was disappoint me, since 
none of these shades were even 
remotely close to my brown skin. If 

I wanted to get one that matched, 
I had to walk through the dessert 
aisle: Butter Pecan, Caramel, Praline, 
Chai, Cocoa, Tiramisu, Ganache, 
Truffle… 

I was always annoyed that the 

shades I had to choose from were 
not as pretty and delicate as the 
lighter shades. But, at the time, I did 
not realize how problematic these 
sweet-inspired names actually were. 
The association of dark skin tones 
with chocolate and other foods is so 
normalized and deeply entrenched 
in our society through makeup, 
dating and daily conversations. Many 
people find it flattering to compare 
our skin to caramel or mocha, but it 
is blatantly dehumanizing. And yes, 
white skin is occasionally labeled 
as white chocolate, but only when 
the context includes brown or Black 
people. These dessert based labels 
were likely popularized as a way to 
show people that brown and Black 
skin can be beautiful, since they 
resemble foods we crave so much. 
But it has gone too far and reduced us 
to just those labels. When I see these 
names, I start to feel as if people 
can only see me as beautiful if they 

compare my skin to desserts. My 
skin should not have to be compared 
to food to be seen as attractive. It’s 
attractive on its own.

This verbiage is dehumanizing 

because it implies that dark-skinned 
women are consumable products. 
While lighter shades are marketed 
as abstract and intangible, darker 
shades are named after purchasable 
items. All the shade names are also 
unhealthy desserts that people 
refer to as guilty pleasures. I felt 
as though even if people liked my 
skin color, the same people would 
still feel embarrassed by it. These 
shade names are a textbook example 
of fetishization, reducing people 
of color to merely their race and 
its corresponding stereotypes. It 
contributes to the idea that the 
lives of people of color must center 
around white people, implying that 
whiteness is the norm and thus 
dessert-based 
comparables 
are 

necessary context for darker skin 
tones. By reducing our skin color to 
just something to be consumed, the 
beauty industry is fetishizing us.

I wasn’t particularly into “New 

Pokémon Snap” for the first couple of 
hours. I’ve been a fan of the franchise 
since I got my first Pokémon card on 
the playground in first grade, but the 
spinoff games have historically been 
hit-or-miss. Although Game Freak’s 
most recent release “Pokémon Mystery 
Dungeon: Rescue Team DX” left me 
utterly disappointed, I had very high 
hopes for “New Pokémon Snap”. 
These hopes led to me to unrealistic 
expectations, and upon starting the 
game it felt repetitive to a fault and 
overall 
unremarkable. 
However, 

about two and a half hours in, I had 
a realization — this game was never 
meant to be a grand undertaking, it was 
meant to be simple and relaxing. As 
soon as I let go and let myself enjoy the 
simplicity, I was positively hooked.

“New Pokémon Snap” is the 

sequel to 1999’s “Pokémon Snap” for 
Nintendo 64. The game follows the 

same formula as its predecessor: take 
pictures of Pokémon while riding 
along a set path, this time in one of the 
wide range of natural environments 

in the all-new Lental region. Once the 
player returns to the appropriately 
named Laboratory of Ecological and 
Natural Sciences (L.E.N.S.), biological 
researcher Professor Mirror judges 

the photos based on a four star system 
that’s organized by the quality of the 
Pokémon’s pose, placement, and size, 
among other categories. These photos 

are then saved in the “Photodex,” 
documenting each Pokémon in the 
game. The goals are simply to take 
photos that qualify for each of the star 
categories and to capture the “Illumina 

phenomenon,” which causes plants 
and Pokémon to glow.

There’s a story to pull the player 

through the game, which boils down 
to taking photos that provide Professor 
Mirror with more information on the 
phenomenon he’s investigating. With 
help from the professor’s assistant, Rita, 
and a few tools — including Fluffruits, 
a melody player, and a scanner — the 
player can gain enough trust with 
Pokémon to raise their research level 
and discover exciting new Pokémon 
behaviors.

If you’re looking for an intense and 

complex adventure, this isn’t that 
game, but it’s still well worth your 
time. “New Pokémon Snap’’ feels like 
taking a vacation without an itinerary: 
just sit back, enjoy the ride, and 
observe cute Pokémon in their natural 
habitats. In a world that typically 
presents its creatures as having some 
sort of purpose or benefit to humans, 
it’s a breath of fresh air to watch an 
ecosystem do nothing but exist. There’s 
no doubt that it’s repetitive, but it’s 
a joyful escape that’s surprisingly 

addicting. It also happens to have 
the most impressive graphics of any 
Pokémon game to date, so each picture 
can more accurately represent Lental 
in all its bright, colorful glory.

Due in part to the quality graphics, 

the game is also perfect social media 
bait. Sharing photos is explicitly 
encouraged both in-game and in 
reality. Online features include a built 
in hub to share your own photos and 
view your friends’. Pictures can also 
be enhanced with the game’s editing 
capabilities, which allow the player to 
retake photos or add filters and stickers. 
Players can view their total Photodex 
score and see how their photography 
skills stack up against their friends and 
players worldwide. With the ability to 
save photos onto the Nintendo Switch’s 
album and then share them on social 
media, “New Pokémon Snap” is sure to 
explode online. The entire world needs 
to see Bouffalant in a flower crown, 
and I now have the power to grant that 
wish. 

Dodie’s ‘Build a Problem’ celebrates where she’s been and where 

she’s going

The day before the release of her 

debut album Build a Problem, British 
singer-songwriter Dodie marked the 
10 year anniversary of her YouTube 
channel with a cover of ABBA’s “Thank 
You For the Music.” Over the last 
decade, Dodie has established herself 
as a steady presence on the platform, 
an exceedingly rare kind of content 
creator who never left to focus on other 
ventures, avoided controversy and 
grew up right alongside her audience. 
Those who have followed her over the 
years know about her mental health 
struggles, who her friends are and 
have already celebrated the release of 
multiple EPs with her.

Her work as a musician and an 

online creator is linked in a way that 
her contemporaries (for example, 
Troye Sivan, who also found fame 
through YouTube but stopped posting 
vlogs leading up to the release of his 
debut album Blue Neighborhood) 
have actively rejected. This is part 
of what makes her celebration of 10 
years on YouTube so notable. Unlike 
the shallow, cash-grabbing music of 
YouTubers and influencers like Jake 
Paul and Addison Rae, Dodie’s music 

has always been honest and grounded. 
The core of her fan base — those who 
have been around since her breakout 
song “Absolutely Smitten” or even 
longer — is loyal and was earned slowly 
but organically. Her songs often touch 
on dependency in love, her deep-
seated feelings of inadequacy, and her 
struggles with fame and her mental 
health — topics she’s never shied away 
from talking about online.

Build a Problem, Dodie’s first full-

length album, comes after 10 years and 
three EPs, and it manages to feel both 
like a culmination of everything she’s 
done so far and the very beginning of 
something big.

References to her previous work 

are scattered through the album and 
act both as easter eggs for her fans and 
reflections of her growth as an artist. 
Three songs on her new album — “Air 
So Sweet,” “Cool Girl” and “Rainbow” 
— had been previously released on 
her YouTube channel as one-take, 
unpolished videos in which she’s 
accompanied by little more than her 
ukulele.

The clearest reference and the 

thing that makes the album feel most 
like Dodie’s work coming full circle 
is “When,” a reworked version of the 
track which closed Intertwined. In 
the song, Dodie confesses to living life 

with one foot in the present and one 
in the past, “busy begging the past to 
stay.” The lyrics in the new version 
are unchanged, but Build a Problem’s 
“When” is noticeably fuller. The 
single piano, violin and cello which 
accompanied Dodie in the original 
version are replaced by a thirteen-piece 
orchestra that creates a rich, cresting, 
almost Disney-like wall of sound 
behind her voice, which has clearly 
matured since 2016.

Dodie’s intelligence as a songwriter 

and musician is emphasized by the 
changes she has made. The new 
orchestrations make the song feel fuller 
and effectively underscore the longing 
at the core of the song. The presence 
of “When” on both her debut EP and 
debut album feels like the loveliest of 
bookends, marking the beginning of 
an era and then ushering it out lovingly. 
Even though Dodie tells us that 
she’s still stuck in the past, the clear 
development in her skill as a producer 
from one “When” to another shows us 
how much she continues to grow.

Many of the album’s musical 

elements will also feel familiar to fans. 
Dodie, who through her career has 
fallen into and then elevated the “white 
girl with a ukulele” trope, employs a 
baritone ukulele as a centerpiece of 
multiple songs. It’s a trademark of hers, 

but it never feels quirky or gimmicky; 
instead, it purposefully creates a 
throughline in the album. However, 
where her YouTube videos tend to 
stick to a more minimal sound, she’s 
joined by a full set of strings on multiple 
tracks, a well-placed cello and clarinet 
in “Special Girl” and heavy percussion 
in “Boys Like You” that adds to the 
groove of the album.

Thematically, Build a Problem is rife 

with uncertainty and regret. “Hate 
Myself” and “Sorry” are the most 
obvious examples. The former is an 
upbeat, one-sided conversation with 

a partner who is prone to going silent 
during arguments, and the latter feels 
like it takes place in the immediate 
aftermath of a brutal falling out in which 
both parties have said things they wish 
they could take back. Still, there are 
pockets of hopefulness. “Rainbow” 
is an acknowledgment of Dodie’s 
bisexuality and her frustration with 
the label and public misunderstanding 
of it, but also a recognition of belonging 
to the queer community and refusal to 
change who she is.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“Ariadne” by Jennifer Saint is, at 

first, a retelling of the Greek myth of 
Theseus, but it doesn’t stay that way 
for long. Saint has not written another 
tale of men performing great feats of 
bravery and strength, but a portrait of 
the lives left devastated in their callous 
wake. The women that fill these pages 
are painted with an incisive brush, the 
result of which is female characters 
that are full of nuance and complexity 
rarely afforded to historical women. 
Saint takes a well-known myth that 
exalts the exploits of men and draws 
from it a stunning story of female 
resilience and solidarity.

For those unfamiliar with the myth 

of Theseus, the basic premise is as 
follows: Theseus is an Athenian prince 
and demigod who travels to Crete to 
slay the minotaur, a monster that dwells 
in the labyrinth and feasts on live 
human sacrifices brought from Athens. 
The princess of Crete, Ariadne, betrays 
her father to help Theseus on this quest. 
Theseus, having freed the Athenians 
from the horror of sacrificing their 
children, goes on to become the king of 
Athens and a legendary hero. Even for 
most of us who know the story, Ariadne 

fades into obscurity as soon as Theseus 
is no longer in need of her assistance. 
Jennifer Saint is determined to change 
that — to carve a place for women 
amongst tall tales of men’s heroics and 
glory.

This book does not shy away from 

explicitly feminist themes. The early 
lives of the two female protagonists 

(Ariadne and her younger sister, 
Phaedra) are entirely defined by 
the whims of proud, power-hungry 
men, from their father King Minos to 
Poseidon himself. They feel themselves 
to be little more than tools, important 
only as a means by which to further 
the ambitions and desires of men. 
But though they know themselves to 

be helpless in the face of the world’s 
demands, they struggle to resign 
themselves to this fate. As a young 
woman, Ariadne swears to never go 
down without a fight, to never be the 
broken victim she sees in her mother: 
“I would be Medusa, if it came to it, I 
resolved. If the gods… came for me to 
punish a man’s actions, I would… wear 
that coronet of snakes, and the world 
would shrink from me instead.”

It is this resoluteness, then, that 

motivates her to help Theseus. She 
isn’t just lovestruck, as is commonly 
depicted (though she’s certainly that 
too) — she’s also desperate to claim her 
own destiny and to escape from under 
the crushing thumb of her father. She 
falls hard and fast, not just for Theseus’s 
handsomeness and bravery, but for the 
possibilities he presents to her. And 
though she is foolish in her trust more 
than once, as she readily admits in 
hindsight, she is equally fierce in her 
loyalty to her fellow women and her 
love and protection of the vulnerable 
and suffering. This is her strength, 
and though she does not wield a club 
to crush monsters or gallivant through 
cities parading her godly heritage as 
Theseus does, it easily rivals Theseus’s 
power in its own, quiet way. Ariadne 
develops into a hero in her own right, 
and in doing so she challenges our 

assumptions about who and what 
heroes have to be and want.

Phaedra, on the other hand, is 

stubborn and daring; if she had been 
born a boy, she would have been the one 
slaying monsters. She is determined 
to make her mark on the world and 
incapable of watching as it passes her 
by, even while inexorably relegated to 
the sphere of hospitality and childcare. 
Just a girl when the story begins, she, 
too, finds a way to loosen the ropes 
that bind her to her lowly station of 
“woman.” But try as they might, and 
despite their differences, each sister 
will learn in turn that they can never 
truly be free of them.

“Ariadne” toys with the heart and 

stomach. Horror, dread and anger — so 
much anger — are interspersed with 
relief and joy in a loop that grinds to a 
halt only in the very last paragraph. 
Ariadne and Phaedra feel real, even 
though 
their 
life 
circumstances 

are so fantastical. They are at once 
surrounded by gods and magic and 
torn by the same forces women across 
the world and throughout time have 
been burdened with. They know the 
unsteadiness of finding one’s own two 
feet and the determination to take 
fate by the reigns anyway. 

What the modern blockbuster can learn from ‘Interstellar’

The current state of the moden 

blockbuster can be a bit tricky to pin 
down at the moment. Due to the fact 
that most big-budget projects have 
been pushed back into the next couple 
of years, only a handful of blockbusters 
have been released over the past year 
or so. But those few releases are still 
able to key us into where the genre is 
headed. Almost all were sequels or 
remakes for existing films, and the 
reception settled around a consensus of 
“it’s good to distract from the world, but 
it could be so much more.” 

This has been a trend for a while 

now. Of the thirty most expensive 
movies ever made, just one is not based 
on a pre-existing property (though you 
could say two if you don’t count the 
Rapunzel fairytale). It is very clear what 
Hollywood’s money is being pumped 
into, and from a business perspective 
it makes sense. If you’re going to spend 
hundreds of millions of dollars making 
a film, you want to be sure people want 
to see it, and one of the easiest ways to 

do that is by basing it off of something 
that already exists and people enjoy.

It’s worked out well so far for the 

studios, as only about three of the films 
could really be considered failures (all 
by Disney who has more than made 
up the profits). They don’t really care 
that the reception among critics and 
audiences ranges from “that was bad” 
to “that was surprisingly good.” As long 
as the money keeps rolling in, they’ll 
keep putting most of their eggs in safe 
baskets.

Not to respark the Scorsese vs. 

Marvel debate, but his criticisms 
are relevant to discussions about the 
medium of film as an art form. Most 
of the money in the film industry isn’t 
currently going into art, it’s going into 
products. Studios aren’t interested in 
telling meaningful stories or pushing 
the technical limits of film, they are 
solely interested in making money. And 
when you’re solely interested in making 
money, you’re much less likely to take 
chances on films that don’t satisfy the 
largest demographic possible.

But original films that take big risks 

can be very successful. Up until 2019, 
the two highest grossing films of all 

time were “Avatar” and “Titanic”, 
two original films that pushed the 
boundaries of what was possible with 
film technology at the time. Sure, the 
hit rate might not be as high, and the 
return isn’t always going to be as much 

as an Avengers film, but if invested in 
and marketed well, these riskier films 
can be very successful commercially 
and critically.

Unfortunately, at the moment, these 

films and potential filmmakers aren’t 
being given the chance. Apart from 

James Cameron — who directed the 
aforementioned highest grossing films 
of all time, and who doesn’t appear to 
be working on any non-Avatar sequels 
in the foreseeable future — there’s 
really only one filmmaker who can get 

risky, original, big-budget films made: 
Christopher Nolan.

Whether he can still do that after the 

pandemic-induced failure of his latest 
release “Tenet” is to be determined, 
but his track record suggests that the 
big-budget features that Hollywood 

doesn’t want to make can be extremely 
successful at the box office, as well 
as thought-provoking pieces of art. 
After the success of his Dark Knight 
Trilogy, based on the characters from 
Batman comics and previous movies, 
Nolan was given a blank check to make 
whatever he wished. The first was 
“Inception”, a heist film that dealt with 
ideas of dream states and alternate 
realities. It was a smash at the box 
office, and it even found itself among 
that year’s Oscar nominees for Best 
Picture, indicating that despite its large 
budget it was able to garner a sense of 
prestige not typically associated with 
bigger, blockbuster features.

“Inception” is a fantastic film, but it 

probably falls a bit more on the side of 
“The Avengers” than “Citizen Kane.” 
That’s not a bad thing necessarily, and 
was probably part of the reason it was 
so successful, but despite all of the 
interesting things Nolan and his crew 
do with structure and visual effects, it 
still lacks the emotional resonance of 
something that Martin Scorsese might 
describe as “cinema.”

Billy Magic and the internet’s unabashed enthusiasm for public transit

“

Americans only love the college 
experience because it’s the only 
time in their lives they live in a 

walkable community,” reads a viral 
January 2020 tweet. Ann Arbor fits 
the bill, hosting most campus buildings 
and housing within about a one-mile 
radius and offering free transit to 
students. I’ve always found pleasure in 
proximity. 

I like to imagine the buildings on 

campus opened up like Richard Scarry 
books to allow peeks into what goes 
on. Scientists bait lab rats a short walk 
from where swimmers count down to 
the Olympics a step away from where 
a mother delivers a baby a hallway 
across from where a loved one is lost 
to an incurable disease. Elementary 
schoolers learn addition a block from 
where frat brothers play daytime 
pong; a world-class map collection sits 
steps away from the spot where I once 
laughed so hard that coffee came out of 
my nose.

In a dense area like Ann Arbor, 

the marvelous and the mundane are 
neighbors, and you can catch peeks of 
them from the windows of the Blue 
Bus. What a joy it is to get around. 

Luckily, I’m not alone in my love for 

transportation. Bus sentiment varies, 
but a community of half-serious transit 
enthusiasts has risen up around an 
eminently meme-able transportation 
guru named Billy Magic. 

Residing among University of 

Michigan meme royalty like Reggie 
Bee and Big Flappo, Billy Magic has 
become an integral figure of freshman 
orientation in the nine years since the 

Michigan Transportation Musical was 
created. Breaking the fourth wall, Billy 
Magic looks straight into the eyes of the 
eighteen-year-olds packed into lecture 
halls and preaches a gospel of new 
urbanism.

“The masses… need to know that safe 

ride offers a variety of free and low-cost 
options for a ride home!” Magic says.

With 
its 
slightly 
censorious 

cheerfulness 
and 
ever-changing 

ratio of irony and sincerity, the video 
has built a cult-like obsession for the 
campus’s decidedly unsexy fleet of blue 
diesel buses. How did this happen?

Baby you can drive my bus

I 

tracked down the writer behind 
the 12-minute musical, a Brooklyn-
based director and social-impact 

storyteller named Emily Lyon. When I 
asked how the character of Billy Magic 
was born, she responded carefully. 

“I was staring at a blank page and 

realized that my script about the magic 
bus needed a guide,” Lyon told me over 
the phone. “And then Billy Magic just 
came to me.” 

She paused, deliberating. 
“I can’t attribute it to anything except 

… inspiration from the gods,” Lyon said.

The former Music, Theatre & Dance 

student 
had 
made 
informational 

PSA-style videos for the University 
before with a student-run production 
company called Filmic, but no project 
had been this big. Tasked with 
replacing the previous transportation 
video, Lyon knew she wanted to use 
humor.

She felt an obligation to preserve 

the endearing cringe-worthiness of 
the video’s precursor, a late-nineties 
production that was memorable for its 
lack of self-awareness. Lyon described 
it as a “run-of-the-mill PSA video” 

“But sort of dramatic, like D.A.R.E,” 

she said. “I loved it,.”

With that in mind, she and a team 

from Filmic let goofy ideas fly. 

“We were aware that this was a 

ridiculous topic, and our audience is 
teenagers who are dubious of content 
… we decided to play into it,” Lyon said. 
“Few people show up to orientation 
thinking, ‘You know what I want to 
talk about? Buses!’ … Except maybe 
Billy Magic.”

The video’s three days of filming 

were chock-full of improvisation. 
Boundaries were pushed. 

“We had a lot of fun with it … a lot,” 

recounted Lyon. 

Others agreed, including co-star 

Nick Skardarasy. I called him on 
the phone to discuss his reflections 
on the project nearly nine years 
after he co-starred as a kid — “The 
Kid,” according to the credits — to 
whom Billy Magic explained campus 
transportation. Skardarasy told me 
that the team had a good time. 

He also hinted that some scenes 

were cut on account of their suggestive 
content. One of those deleted scenes 
stuck with him for nearly ten years, 
and though he couldn’t tell me exactly 
what it was, he disclosed that it implied 
a sexual relationship between Billy and 
a bus.

As a creator, Lyon still has a knack for 

using humor to make dry but important 
topics palatable. I asked her what PSAs 
should be revamped to be funny, and 
her immediate response was “all of 
them.” Specifically, she’d like to see 
more jokes and gags in “Terms and 
Conditions” (the average American’s 
digital contracts would take 250 hours 
to read!). 

“One of my favorite quotes is this: 

‘Laughter is the sound of recognition,’ 
meaning that an audience that laughs 
is still with you,” Lyon explained. 

Meme page fame

T

here’s a contagiousness to Billy 
Magic’s pure and uncomplicated 
adoration 
for 
buses 
that 

catapulted the video to meme fame 
almost 
immediately. 
Skardarasy 

recalls freshmen pointing at him and 
approaching him after the video’s 
first showing in fall 2012; nearly eight 
years later, C.J. Eldred (who played 
Billy) was repeatedly asked to sign 
autographs on the Diag during a recent 
visit. Borderline evangelical zeal for the 
short film continues to this day. 

In the poll the Facebook group 

UMich Memes for Wolverteens used 
to determine its official endorsement 
for 2020 Democratic nominee for 
president, Billy Magic got 11.52% of the 
vote, coming in third place only behind 
Reggie Bee and Bernie Sanders. He 
later appeared in a meme captioned 
“AND WITH 100% OF PRECINCTS 
REPORTING, BILLY MAGIC HAS 
WON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION!” Meme page admin 

Zachary Wernet made the short film its 
own IMDB page. A Billy Magic design 
for wall art in Animal Crossing got 
over 450 likes. Seniors get graduation 
photos in front of M-buses in honor 
of the video, and the team behind the 
video even reunited to speak at the 
virtual 2020 graduation. A quirky 
12-minute informational video has 
made buses, of all things, inexplicably 
cool for almost ten years. 

Over the phone, Lucas Renno, 

renowned admin of UMich Memes for 
Wolverteens, recounted to me his first 
impression of Billy Magic. 

“I remember sitting turning to the 

girl next to me in the auditorium and 
saying ‘What the hell did I just watch?’” 
Renno told me.

In his opinion, the Michigan 

Transportation 
Musical 
is 
great 

because it tries just hard enough. 

“Too many big institutions try 

too hard,” Renno said. “They make 
communications that are obviously 
intended to be funny or ‘hip with 
the youths,’ and they fall flat on their 
face. It’s clear from the beginning that 
this video was written and directed 
by students rather than school 
bureaucrats.”

Planes, trains, not automobiles

The 
Michigan 
Transportation 

Musical isn’t the only corner of the 
internet where deliberately over-
the-top 
enthusiasm 
for 
public 

transportation runs free.

An incomplete journey of identity and self-acceptance

Trigger Warning: Homophobia; 
internalized homophobia
W

hen I was 12 years old, my 
mother told me to unbutton 
my collar because I looked 

like a lesbian. She assured me only a 
moment later, after I had undone two 
of the buttons, that it wasn’t bad to be a 
lesbian — I just shouldn’t misrepresent 
who I was. Years later, she would call 
me a “d*ke,” but I would laugh it off 
and pretend it didn’t haunt me all the 
way into adulthood.

When I was 16 years old, my 

grandmother asked my mother if I 
was a lesbian because I had never 
had a long-term relationship with a 
boy. My mother assured her I was 
no such thing; I was just focusing on 
my grades. I didn’t have time for a 
relationship – I was trying to get into 
a good college, and that required most 
of my attention. 

Growing up, words like “gay” and 

“lesbian” were never intrinsically 
linked with being “sinful” or “amoral” 
despite my Christian upbringing and 

eight-year attendance to a Christian 
school. But those words were treated 
as something you shouldn’t say, 
something you should never assume 
about someone. They were treated 
as the ultimate marring of character, 
but never a sin. That is to say, I was 
never told I was going to Hell nor 
that I would be disowned, but it was 
still thought of as an unfortunate 
affliction. It was still something to feel 
shame over, not take pride in.

I truly believed that I hadn’t grown 

up in a homophobic environment 
because I knew my family wouldn’t 
kick me out for being different — and 
don’t get me wrong, I’m incredibly 
privileged in that way. I am incredibly 
privileged to know that my parents 
would still accept me no matter who 
I loved. But, that being said, I’ve still 
spent the last several years of my life 
trying to come to terms with who I 
am and trying to unlearn the harmful 
words that my family used around me 
during my adolescence.

I was 15 years old when I first 

started questioning my sexuality. My 
best friend of 10 years had just come 
out, and he’d explained to me some 
of the experiences he’d had. I found 
myself relating more than I thought 
I would. The way he described his 
feelings towards girls was exactly the 
same feeling I’d had toward boys my 
whole life: this utter lack of desire to 
have any sort of romantic or sexual 
relationship with them. But I had 
also convinced myself that I felt the 
same way towards women. I hadn’t 
even thought about the possibility 
of being attracted to women — I 
also don’t remember seeing a wlw 
(woman-loving-woman) couple on 
television, in the books I was reading 
or in my real life until late into my 
teenage years. And any same-sex 
relationship I had seen was treated as 
something different. Something other. 
Something I knew I needed to avoid 
for myself. 

The outcome of the 2015 Obergefell 

vs. Hodges Supreme Court case, 
legalizing 
same-sex 
marriage 

nationwide, sent a barrage of mixed 
emotions through me. At the time, I 
was still deeply rooted in my family’s 
religion and hadn’t yet come to 
understand any of my own views – I 
was simply parroting theirs. I knew 
my parents weren’t thrilled about the 
outcome, but they also didn’t think 
it was going to cause “America’s 
moral downfall,” or any of the other 
things I’d heard many Christians 
in my own church say. However, I 
also believed that the court case was 
never supposed to be something 
that affected me personally – it was 
something others were allowed to 
take pride in.

So, for the entirety of high school, 

I distanced myself from any possible 
bi-curious tendencies. I used the 
label asexual – a person who doesn’t 
experience 
sexual 
attraction 
to 

anyone, regardless of gender. I knew 
this wasn’t quite true, but it was a good 
enough fit for the time. 

* * *

I 

still have so much pride associated 
with the label asexual, despite no 
longer identifying with it as closely 

as I once did. It was my first connection 
to the LGBTQ+ community and to 
the word “queer.” It was my first 
experience with separating different 
types of attraction and understanding 
the complexities of human love. 

We are not told that there is more 

than one way to love someone — that 
there are more than two ways to love 
someone. Sexuality is not as clean and 
simple as some people think it is. 

At some point in my life, my mother 

told me that she didn’t understand 
bisexuality. You either liked men or 
you liked women, she believed. I knew 
then that I would never try to explain 
asexuality to my family. They didn’t 
need to know about it, I reasoned — 
only my partner and I would need to 
know about it.

However, it was still pivotal to my 

understanding of my identity.

A battle between the top two 

teams in the Big Ten conference 
ensued over the weekend, with 
No. 23 Minnesota (26-10 Big 
Ten) playing host to the No. 19 
Michigan softball team (32-6) in a 
four-game series. 

With the Golden Gophers only 

four games behind the top spot 
entering the series, the stakes 
were high, but the Wolverines 
prevailed. They clinched the Big 
Ten regular season championship 
by winning the first three games 
of the series, before dropping the 
finale on Sunday. 

“I think (winning the Big 

Ten championship) is a great 
accomplishment by this group,” 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
said. “It’s a great accomplishment 
in a season that was difficult.”

Senior first baseman Lou Allan 

opened the series with a bang on 
Friday night. She clobbered an 
inside pitch from Minnesota’s 
Amber Fiser in the top of the first 
inning, redirecting it high over 
the left-centerfield fence for a 
solo home run to give Michigan a 
lead it would not relinquish, going 
on to win 3-0. 

“As soon as she hit that we 

were like, ‘man this is going to 
be a great start to everything,’” 
sophomore second baseman Julia 
Jimenez said. “We just wanted to 
attack right after that … so it gave 
us a good start.”

Despite the early miscue, Fiser 

held her own throughout the tilt. 
She allowed only four hits in the 
complete game performance, but 
each mistake she made proved 
costly. 
With 
the 
combined 

performance of the Wolverines’ 
co-aces, who pitched a 14 strikeout 
shutout, the three runs were more 
than enough. 

Senior 
left-hander 
Meghan 

Beaubien, who saw action in each 
game of the series, started the 
game and commanded the circle 
early. After allowing a leadoff 
single in the bottom of the sixth, 
junior right-hander Alex Storako 
came in for relief. She struck out 
all six batters faced, securing 
the opening game victory for 
Michigan. 

The series shifted to a double 

header on Saturday, where the 
Wolverines took care of business, 
winning the first game 10-4, and 
the second 3-1. 

A two run home run to right field 

by Jimenez put the Wolverines up 
3-0 in the top of the third inning 
in the day’s opening game, and a 
two RBI single up the middle by 

Allan gave Michigan a sizable 5-0 
advantage in the fourth.

In the top of the sixth, freshman 

catcher Keke Tholl recorded the 
first RBIs of her career, pinch 
hitting with the bases loaded, and 
dropping a single into right field 
to score two. 

The Wolverines led 10-0 when 

Minnesota responded offensively 
in the bottom of the sixth. Storako 
— who posted nine strikeouts 
in her five innings— and senior 
right-hander Sarah Schaefer saw 
four runs (two earned) come 
across in the frame, leaving 
Beaubien to close the door in the 

seventh. 

Saturday’s second game was a 

pitcher’s duel between Beaubien 
and the Golden Gophers’ stud 
right-hander Autumn Pease. 

Although 
Minnesota 
struck 

first, jumping to a 1-0 lead in the 
second inning, Beaubien went 
the rest of the game unscathed. 
The Michigan offense slowly got 
to Pease, and a sacrifice fly from 
Blair in the sixth proved to be the 
winning run in the conference 
title clinching affair. 

The Wolverines, though, were 

unable to carry their momentum 
into the series closer on Sunday. 

They fell 7-3 in a wire-to-wire 
defeat — losing their 11-game win 
streak in the process. 

After an Allan double put 

Michigan up 1-0 in the top of the 
first, Minnesota took control, 
handing Storako her worst outing 
of the season. After allowing four 
total home runs all season prior 
to the game, the Gophers blasted 
three home runs off the right-
hander in the first two innings to 
go up 4-1. 

Storako 
then 
hit 
Natalie 

Denhartog with the first pitch 
of the top of the third, and 
walked Katelyn Kemmetmueller 
the very next at-bat, ending 
her uninspiring day. She went 
two plus innings, allowing five 
earned runs in her third loss of 
the season. By the game’s end, 
Minnesota would end up plating 
seven runs, and the Wolverines 
were unable to rally. 

Despite the lackluster final 

game, Michigan managed to win a 
key road series against the Golden 
Gophers 
to 
secure 
its 
third 

straight conference title. 

“The goal is to be able to 

compete and win against the 
quality 
opponents,” 
Hutchins 

said. “It’s what we’re trained to 
do, and we executed it three out 
of four … so (it feels) pretty good, 
pretty darn good.”

Frontline starters showcase potential against MSU

Redshirt 
sophomore 
left-

hander Steven Hajjar hopped 
out of the dugout to congratulate 
sophomore 
right-hander 
Cam 

Weston as Weston strolled off 
the field against Michigan State. 
The pair allowed just two hits 
between them as they dominated 
the Spartan hitters and led the 
Wolverines to 5-1 and 3-1 victories, 
respectively.

Hajjar has gotten much of 

the plaudits this season, but he 
put together his best outing of 
the season on Friday with six 
scoreless innings. Hajjar racked 
up a whopping 13 strikeouts, 
allowing just one hit and one walk.

a lot of strong arms,” Weston 

said. “We just have trust in 
our guys to put up zeros when 
it matters, to have shut-down 
innings, getting a lot of strikeouts, 

things like that.”

Yet his performance was one-

upped 
by 
his 
rotation-mate, 

Weston. Weston threw a complete 
game, allowing just one hit while 
striking out nine. He was dominant 
for large parts, including a stretch 
where he retired 20 consecutive 
batters.

“He throws hard,” Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich said. “He has 
good stuff and he usually is a guy 
that gets strike one and strike two 
very quickly. He’s one of the best 
pitchers in not just the conference 
but the country, so we’re very glad 
he’s on our team.”

Weston has had several strong 

outings earlier this year, including 
a three-game stretch in which he 
tossed 18.2 scoreless innings in a 
row. Weston now has a 2.93 ERA 
over 61.1 innings. Hajjar has been 
consistent as well, sporting a 2.88 
ERA and a 3-0 record over 56.1 
innings.

While 
Michigan 
dropped 

the final game of the series 
to Michigan State, 10-2, the 
performance 
of 
its 
top 
two 

pitchers was very encouraging.

“Hajjar’s 
just 
been 
very 

consistent, Weston’s been pretty 
consistent,” Bakich said. “Using 
those other three guys in Jacob 
Denner and Ben Dragani and Blake 
Beers, we’ve mixed and matched 
after (Hajjar and Weston).”

In 
the 
NCAA 
tournament, 

the first two starters are vital. If 
the Wolverines can stay in the 
winner’s bracket in the regional 
round, a 2-0 start in the double 
elimination format would force 
opponents into a tough spot. In 
the 2019 tournament, 12 of the 16 
regional champions started 2-0 — 
including Michigan.

“We know that Hajjar and 

Weston will go game one and game 
two,” Bakich said. “We’ll have to 
figure out, based on the numbers 
and the data and information that 
we have, who’s going to be the best 

third starter and who’s going to be 
best coming out of the bullpen.”

Those first two games — and the 

first two starters in those games 
— will prove vital, particularly as 
the Wolverines will likely face a 
higher-seeded team in the second 

round, based on current rankings 
and projections; Baseball America 
currently projects Michigan to 
be a two seed in the South Bend 
regional.

For Spencer Heslop, commitment to faith requires 

difficult decisions

For 
Michigan’s 
wheelchair 

tennis team, their competitive 
debut went about as well as 
anyone could’ve hoped. 

In 
the 
team’s 
first 
ever 

appearance at the Collegiate 
Wheelchair 
Tennis 
National 

Championships, the Wolverines’ 
athletes were finalists in the 
team competition and all but one 
of the individual competitions. 
The team racked up other 
accolades 
as 
well, 
bringing 

home 
three 
academic 
all-

American awards in addition to 
Graduate Student Chris Kelley’s 
sportsmanship honor. In doing 
so, Michigan established itself 
as a force to be reckoned with 
on the collegiate adaptive sports 
scene, 
gaining 
respect 
and 

recognition from competitors 
and doubters alike. 

Still, a sense of “What could’ve 

been?” lingers. 

A pesky asterisk sits alongside 

one of the Wolverines’ finalist 

designations. Graduate student 
Spencer 
Heslop 
forwent 
his 

chance to potentially be crowned 
a champion in both his and the 
Wolverines’ 
first 
competitive 

wheelchair tennis appearance. 

Heslop didn’t really know 

what to expect coming into 
the tournament. Primarily a 
wheelchair 
basketball 
player 

— Heslop played basketball for 
four years at the University of 
Illinois — he only began training 
seriously for wheelchair tennis 
within the past year. Truthfully, 
all that mattered to Heslop 
before his debut is that he gave 
it his all.

And that he did. In Tier 2, the 

intermediate-level 
individual 

tier, 
the 
unknown 
Heslop 

shocked his more experienced 
opponents, 
performing 

dominantly in each of his three 
matches. In all, Heslop dropped 
only a single set on his path to 
the Tier 2 final. 

In 
the 
team 
competition, 

Heslop partnered with Kelley, 
Michigan’s 
highest-ranked 

and most experienced player, 

admirably well. The pair blew 

away Biola University’s duo before 

upsetting 
the 
second-ranked 

San Diego State University in a 

thrilling contest, setting Michigan 

up for a final showdown against 

the five-time champion University 

of Alabama. 

But for Heslop, this was the 

end of the road. The Tier 2 trophy 

was handed to Clemson’s Jeff 

Townsend, and Michigan’s Caiden 

Baxter would take Heslop’s place 

in the team final. 

Heslop, a lifelong member of 

the Church of Jesus Christ of 

Latter-Day Saints, is a committed 

observer of the Sabbath. While 

different people and religious 

groups observe the Sabbath in 

different ways, for Heslop, it 

means that he doesn’t study, 

work, or compete in any athletic 

competitions on Sundays. 

“It’s not that he says ‘thou 

shalt not play on Sundays,’” 
Heslop said. “It’s something that 
I’ve chosen to do as a sign of 
my commitment to try to follow 
him, to take a day to try to be a 
little bit more kind, a little more 

loving in terms of reaching out 
to others and helping them feel 
loved.” 

Undoubtedly, setting aside an 

entire day each week to observe 
the Sabbath is a significant 
commitment, 
and 
it 
hasn’t 

come without its challenges 
for Heslop. A lifelong athlete, 
Heslop has sat out a considerable 
number of games throughout his 
life to uphold the commitment to 
his faith. 

“Especially 
when 
I 
was 

younger, it was even harder than 
it is now. It was important for me 
to find out if this is what I truly 
believed, if I was committed to 
this personally,” Heslop said. 
“I did a lot of soul searching. 
But 
ultimately, 
I 
made 
this 

commitment and I feel like I’ve 
become a better person because 
of it.”

So, while Heslop’s decision to 

sit out the Tier 2 and team finals 
may incite disbelief for some, his 
mind was made up a long time 
ago. Going into the tournament, 
Heslop knew that if he played well 
enough to make it to the final day, 

he would have to accept 
finishing as the Tier 2 
runner-up by default and 
watch the team final from 
the sidelines.

For 
some, 
knowing 

that they couldn’t win 
the championship even if 
they played well enough 
to 
deserve 
it 
would 

significantly 
impact 

their performance. But 
for Heslop, competition 
is about far more than 
individual accolades. 

“It definitely weighs on 

my mind a little bit, but at 
the end of the day, it’s for 
the team. In the individual 
competition, I just wanted 
to perform as well as I 
could, and as far as that 
got me, so be it,” Heslop 
said. “And as much I’d like 
to be able to take part in 
the team final, I also know 
that my teammates want 
to and deserve to, and I 
think that strengthened 
my resolve to get us (to the 
final).

“I can’t say that there 

aren’t 
moments 
where 

I 
don’t 
wonder 
‘what 

if’, 
but 
focusing 
on 

those moments doesn’t get you 
anywhere other than in a tougher 
place. So I try to channel that 
energy to being a voice of support 
from the sideline.”

While 
Heslop 
has 
been 

committed 
to 
observing 
the 

Sabbath for a long time now, 
the experience of having to sit 
Sundays out hasn’t become any 
easier. The team, however, stands 
proudly behind Heslop and his 
beliefs.

“We 
talked 
about 
this 

possibility at the beginning of 
the season and they’ve been 
behind me this whole time,” 
Heslop said. “As we ourselves are 
trying to find our recognition 
within the University and in 
our sphere of DEI, they turned 
around and extended that same 
welcoming atmosphere to me as 
far as religion is concerned. 

“That goes a long way into 

demonstrating 
the 
character 

of the people we have on our 
team.”

While Michigan had been 

in talks with the tournament’s 
organizer, the United States 
Tennis Association (USTA), to 
get the finals moved back to 
Saturday, they were ultimately 
unsuccessful. With Heslop on 
the sidelines, Michigan’s Baxter 
and Kelley put up a valiant fight 
against Alabama’s heavyweights 
in the team final, but fell short 
in the end. 

Heslop’s would-be opponent 

in the Tier 2 final, Clemson’s 
Townsend, was willing to try to 
work out a schedule change — 
the two are former teammates 
and members of the same church 
— but concluded that a Saturday 
final would be too quick a 
turnaround time after already 
playing three matches that day 
in the scorching Orlando heat. 

So, 
for 
Heslop 
and 
for 

Michigan, 
despite 
performing 

better than anyone had expected, 
there will always remain a small 
sense of what might have been. 

For Heslop, though, that’s quite 

alright.

“I feel like I left it all out there 

in the matches I got to play in,” 
Heslop said. “I don’t think I left 
anything unsaid, so to speak. And 
that’s what I focus on more — 
what I did accomplish, instead of 
worrying too much about what I 
could have accomplished.”

STATE 
COLLEGE, 
Pa. 
— 

There’s an old adage in sports that 
it’s hard to beat a team three times 
in a season.

Heading 
into 
its 
matchup 

against 
undefeated 
Maryland, 

the Michigan men’s lacrosse team 
hoped that that adage would once 
again rear its head. After a historic 
win over Ohio State in the first 
round of the Big Ten Tournament, 
the Wolverines were primed to 
catch the Terrapins — who had not 
played in over a week — dozing.

Against Michigan’s best wishes, 

though, the abilities of Maryland’s 
usual 
suspects 
were 
on 
full 

display on Thursday afternoon. 
On the back of a career-high 
10-point, eight-goal outing from 
attackman Jared Bernhardt, the 
No. 1-ranked Terrapins (11-0 Big 
Ten) ended the Wolverines’ (3-9) 
season in the semifinals of the Big 
Ten Tournament, defeating them, 
16-8.

“I think (our last) game, the 

last game of the year, maybe we 
walked off the field feeling like 
we didn’t play our best game,” 

Maryland coach John Tillman 
said. “Having that week off, I 
thought was really helpful for our 
guys just to kind of step away and 
catch their breath. … They were 
really excited (today).”

The Wolverines’ offense began 

the contest with the same tenacity 
and confidence that propelled it to 
victory against the Buckeyes.

Three minutes in, Michigan 

sophomore 
attackman 
Josh 

Zawada opened the scoring when 
he dodged from behind the crease 
and snuck a goal past Terrapins’ 
goalkeeper Logan McNaney. Just 
minutes later, graduate transfer 
midfielder Tyler Papa dodged 
hard down the right alley and fired 
a low-angle shot to the top left 
corner, extending the Wolverines 
lead to two.

Meanwhile, 
Maryland 
was 

kept silent for the first half of the 
opening quarter: partly due to 
a string of saves from Michigan 
junior goalkeeper John Kiracofe, 
partly due to the fact that a trio of 
its shots ricocheted off the post.

The Wolverines’ composure, 

and the Terrapins’ dormancy, 
would only last for so long, though.

As a 16-minute scoring drought 

ensued for Michigan, largely a 

consequence of several errant 
passes 
on 
offense, 
Maryland 

began to capitalize off its own 
possessions. Using speed to their 
advantage, the Terrapins picked 
apart a disjointed Wolverines’ 

defense and rattled off six-straight 
goals — four of which came from 
Bernhardt.

“The 
ball 
just 
zips, 
and 

(Bernhardt) is just too dynamic,” 
Michigan coach Kevin Conry said. 

“We just didn’t have the guy to 
really keep up with them. … He’s 
just special. He’s the best player in 
the country.”

Michigan falls in overtime to North Carolina in National Championship

The 2nd-ranked Michigan field 

hockey team knew it had its work 
cut out for itself in the National 
Championship game. 

The Wolverines (15-2 overall, 

6-0 Big Ten) faced off against the 
top-ranked University of North 
Carolina (19-1, 9-1 ACC), one of the 
best teams in the history of NCAA 
field hockey. The Tar Heels were 
chasing their third consecutive 
national 
championship 
and 

secured it after beating Michigan 
in overtime, 4-3. 

Carolina 
has 
maintained 
a 

37-0 record at home — where the 
championship game was played — 
since 2018, and has only lost one 
game in the past three years. 

Regardless, the Wolverines left 

their hearts out on the field and did 
what they’ve done well all season 
long: persevere. 

Unlike the Tar Heels in the 

ACC, Michigan didn’t play a fall 
season, and were forced to play 

in the spring due to the COVID-
19 pandemic. The Wolverines’ 
didn’t let that get the best of them, 
going on to earn an undefeated 
conference record and winning the 
Big Ten Tournament. One of the 
most impressive parts of the team 
was the season-long performance 
of junior goalkeeper Anna Spieker, 
who allowed only seven goals 
all season until the national 
championship game.

Michigan 
is 
considered 
a 

blue-chip field hockey program, 
qualifying 
for 
the 
NCAA 

tournament eight times since 2010 
under the leadership of coach 
Marcia Pankratz, but the team 
hadn’t made it to the championship 
game since 2001.

“I just couldn’t be more proud 

of how hard (the team) worked all 
season,” Pankratz said after the 
overtime loss. “(They) learned a 
lot and grew and came together as 
a team and respected each other.”

The Wolverines drew first blood 

in the first period as redshirt junior 
forward Kate Burney was able to 
score off the foot of an opposing 

player. Carolina was quick to 
follow-up, scoring 33 seconds later. 

The Tar Heels scored again in 

the second period off of a corner 

and built up a 3-1 lead in third. 
Where other teams would have 
staggered, Michigan rose up to the 
challenge. The team dug their heels 
in and engineered a comeback 
against the defending champs. 

After trimming the deficit to 

one, sophomore forward Sarah 
Pyrtek reacted to a wild ball off of 
a Carolina stick and scored, tying 

the game at three and forcing 
overtime. 

“They’re 
opportunistic. 
We 

knew it was going to be a hard-
fought battle,” Carolina coach 
Karen Shelton said. “Credit to 

them for not folding when they got 
down two goals. They almost got 
better (the more they trailed).” 

The Wolverines had a strong 

opportunity to end the game in 
overtime but missed the game-
ending goal by a few feet. In 
response to the threat, the Tar 
Heels pushed back immediately 
and were able to draw a penalty 
corner. Carolina controlled the 
ball and fired a backhanded shot 
that found its way to the back 
of the goal — ending Michigan’s 
championship hopes in devastating 
fashion. 

Still, the future is bright for 

the Wolverines. When a normal 
fall season gets underway in a 
few months, Michigan expects to 
be right back to competing for a 
national championship. 

“We didn’t give up and we kept 

fighting. And I mean, what more 
can you ask for?” senior fullback 
Halle O’Neill said. “We are such a 
young team. And thankfully, we get 
to get back at it in three months.”
