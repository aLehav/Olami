'U' requests
2.6-percent

state fund ing

FLINT, Mich. - The Univer-
sity's Board of Regents unani-
mously approved a letter to be sent
to the state's
budget direc- NOTEBOOK
tor requesting
a 2.6-percent increase in state
appropriations for the University
at its monthly meeting at the Uni-
versity's campus here.
Written by University President
Mary Sue Coleman and presented
to the regents by University Pro-
vost Philip Hanlon, the letter is
submitted to State Budget Director
Robert Emerson annually by the
University. The document details
the University's cost containment
efforts and its economic influence
on the state as a whole.
In the letter, Coleman wrote
that the University is a catalyst
for economic recovery in Michi-
gan. The additional 2.6 percent in
funding, she wrote, would cover
inflationary costs as well as a one-

percent loss in need-based state
scholarships like the Michigan
Promise Scholarship.
"We acknowledge the fiscal
circumstances of the state," Cole-
man wrote. "Nevertheless, the
University of Michigan plays a
critical role in the stabilization
and revitalization of the Michi-
gan economy. And, we play a criti-
cal role in the development and
education of our workforce and
cannot risk jeopardizing the qual-
ity of our institution, research
and service."
Though the regents voted unan-
imously to approve the letter, there
was some level of dissent within
the board.
Regent Andrea Fischer New-
man (R-Ann Arbor) said she
thinks the University should
have requested more than just a
2.6-percent increase.
"I don't understand why, if
we're doing this, why we wouldn't
ask them for more," Newman said.
"This is an opportunity to lay some
things out and I don't think we
took it."
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Newman said it's inappro-
priate to only ask the state for a
2.6-percent increase, but then
charge students more through
tuition increases.

University President Mary Sue Coleman at the monthly meeting of the University's Board of Regents yesterday. At the meeting, held in Flint, the regents voted to extend
Coleman's contract for an additional two years.
Regents extend President
Coleman's contract to 2014

Board also lays out
goals for Coleman
to focus on
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
FLINT, Mich. - The Univer-
sity's Board of Regents voted
unanimously yesterday here to
approve a motion extending Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man's contract for an additional
two years.
Coleman's current contract
with the University was sched-
uled to end in July 2012, but the
two-year extension approved
yesterday means Coleman will

serve through July 2014. Cole-
man joined the University in 2002
after serving as the president of
the University
of Iowa.
The motion '?
to extend
Coleman's'
contracts
was made t,
by Board of KYLE SWANSON
Regents Chair
Julia Dar- C vrng the
low (D-Ann
Arbor), who
read a statement in support of the
action.
"Throughout her service to the
University, President Coleman
has performed to extraordinarily
high standards and has gained

extraordinarily wide recogni-
tion for her excellence," Darlow
said. "President Coleman has kept
our focus firmly on our mission,
and we have achieved outstand-
ing accomplishments on global,
national and local levels. For the
entire University community, she
has preserved and strengthened
our balance, our direction and our
self-confidence."
Coleman's compensation pack-
age will remain the same in her
new contract, though the Board
of Regents will continue to evalu-
ate her pay each year for possible
merit increases, Darlow said.
"(Coleman's salary) will contin-
ue to be reviewed annually by the
Board and any increases will be
set at the discretion of the Board,

taking into consideration perfor-
mance and other relevant factors
as we did at our last Board meet-
ing in October," Darlow said dur-
ing the meeting.
However, the contract does add
an additional $100,000 to Cole-
man's deferred compensation
package for the current contract
year and the remaining years
on her new contract. However,
because it is deferred compensa-
tion, Coleman will not receive the
money until she retires.
"The amendment is designed
to build a substantial contribu-
tion to her retirement over the
remainder of her term," Darlow
said of Coleman. "Certainly, she
has earned it."

Coleman calls

By DEVON THORSBY
Daily News Editor
The legal directoroftheAmeri-
can Civil Liberties Union of Mich-
igan is raising questions about the
constitutionality of the Depart-
ment of Public Safety's tres-

pass policy in light of its recent
trespass order against Andrew
Shirvell - the former Michigan
assistant attorney general known
for his derisive criticisms of Mich-
igan Student Assembly President
Chris Armstrong.
Michael Steinberg, legal direc-
tor for the ACLU of Michigan,
told annarbor.com yesterday that
he hopes the University will alter
the policy to better follow the
Constitution without the need for
a lawsuit.
"Now that a light has been
shined on the deficient process for

banning individuals from campus
for life, our hope is that the Uni-
versity will take a second look at
this problem, and take action,
without the need for a lawsuit,"
Steinberg told the online outlet
yesterday.
Once a trespass order is issued
it can only be lifted or modified
through a meeting with the DPS
director.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS
Logistical issues delay results

With Transgender Awareness Week, 'U
aims to educate about gender expression

ITS error and high
number of exception
ballots the cause for
unofficial results
* By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
Though the polls for fall stu-
dent government elections closed
at midnight last night, the official
results have yet to be determined
due to logistical issues.

An Information Technology
Services error made it difficult
for School of Nursing students to
vote in the election. In addition an
unusually high number of excep-
tion ballots were cast overall.
According to Michigan Student
Assembly Election Director Sagar
Deshpande, because many of the
elections are extremely close, the
exception ballots will have to be
validated before official results
can be released.
The exception ballots are those
cast by students that for a variety
of reasons were not on the official

list of eligible voters, and there-
fore need to be verified by com-
munication between ITS and the
election director in determining
which of the votes are valid. Those
valid ballots will be converted to
actual votes and counted toward
the total.
According to an e-mail sent
out by Deshpande last night, ITS
loaded an incorrect eligibility list
for the Nursing School election.
Deshpande wrote in the e-mail
that MSA officials discovered the
error after some Nursing students

Ceremony tonight
to honor victims
of hate crimes
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
According to transgenderdor.
org, 30 people worldwide were
murdered this year as a result of
their gender identity or gender
expression. And in actuality this
number is a gross underestimate,

because the website only lists the
deaths that have been reported.
In recognition of those victims
and to increase awareness about
gender expression on campus, the
University's Spectrum Center is
currently hosting Transgender
Awareness Week.
WilliamSherry, assistant direc-
tor of the Spectrum Center, said
the week - which occurs annu-
ally - is essential in educating the
University community because
gender expression is commonly
misunderstood.

"A lot of people can say I know
someone that's gay or lesbian but
when we go out and do presen-
tations we get a lot of questions
about gender identity," Sherry
said.
The week began on Monday
Nov. 15 and continues through
this coming Monday and features
a variety of activities includ-
ing sessions on transgender and
gender-neutral language and film
screenings about people who
faced obstacles as a result of their

COLEMAN
From Page 1A
As partofthe contract, the Board
of Regents laid out seven primary
goals for Coleman to address over
the remaining years of her contract.
Among them, the regents
have asked Coleman to continue
strengthening the University's
academic mission and developing
financial policies that will preserve
the fiscal health of the University.
During her tenure at the Univer-
sity, Coleman worked with other
University officials to eliminate
$135 million inrecurring costs from
the general fund budget in order to
reallocate money to higher prior-
ity projects. Additionally, Coleman
has called for an additional $100
million to be eliminated from the
budget by 2012 and another $120
million by 2017.
At the same time, Coleman led
a faculty hiring initiative aimed at
increasing the number of interdis-
ciplinary faculty and programs at
the University. Coleman allocated
enough money in the University's
budget for the current year to hire
an additional 50 junior faculty
members.
The regents also requested that
Coleman work to improve campus

facilities like student housing and
to grow and strengthen the Uni-
versity of Michigan Health Sys-
tem. In addition, they asked that
Coleman create a leadership plan
that includes developing strong
candidates for leadership positions
throughout the University.
Coleman spearheaded phase one
of a residence life initiative that led
to the renovation of several resi-
dence halls on campus. Officials in
the administration have told The
Michigan Daily that the second
phase of the project is currently
being planned.
Additionally, Coleman played
a major role in planning and over-
seeing the construction of the new
C.S. Mott Children's and Von Voigt-
lander Women's Hospital, which is
set to open in November 2011 - a
year ahead of schedule.
Coleman is also to develop plans
for the University's next capital
campaign. The last University-
wide capital campaign ended in
2008 under Coleman's leadership,
when the University set an all-time
record for the most money raised in
a single capital campaign by a pub-
lic university - $3.2 billion.
Coleman's early career at the
University is often defined by her
role in the two admissions lawsuits
that went before the U.S. Supreme

Court in 2003, less than one year
after Coleman took over. The case
forced the University to modify
it's undergraduate admissions cri-
teria, which gave additional points
to underrepresented minority
applicants in a numerical evalua-
tion process, but reinforced a pro-
cess used by the University's Law
School where ethnicity was one of
many factors considered in admis-
sions.
Speaking at the meeting after her
contract extension was approved,
Coleman thanked the regents and
executive officers for their support.
"I can't imagine working with a
better group of people," Coleman
said. "I look forward to the next
four years. It's been a great expe-
rience and it's going to be a great
experience going forward."
In an interview following the
meeting, Coleman echoed that sen-
timent, saying the University is the
best place she's ever had the privi-
lege to work.
"I love this place and I love the
work I'm doing and the fact that I
can doit for an additional two years
is terrific," Coleman said.
Asked whether she planned to
retire after her new contract ended
in July 2014, Coleman said she
hasn't made any final decisions yet.
"I don't know what I'm doing

yet," Coleman said of her retire-
ment. "I think for me, I'm very
excited for the next four years."
In an interview following yester-
day's meeting, Ora Pescovitz, the
University's executive vice presi-
dent for medical affairs, said she
was "delighted" and "thrilled" that
Coleman will be leading the Uni-
versity for another four years.
"It's great news for the entire
faculty and staff of the University,"
Pescovitz said.
University Provost Philip Han-
lon echoed Pescovitz's sentiment
in a separate interview after yester-
day's meeting. '
"I'm thrilled," Hanlon said of
Coleman's contract extension.
"She's a president at the top of her
game and I'm privileged to be able
to work for her and watch her in
action and learn from her."
Hanlon added, "She's an out-
standing leader for the University."
Other University officials,
including Regent Andrea Fischer
Newman (R-Ann Arbor) and E.
Royster Harper, vice president for
student affairs, said they were also
extremely pleased with the con-
tract extension.
"She's just a dream boss,"
Harper said in an interview. "The
leadership she's providing is phe-
nomenal."

ELECTIONS
From Page 1A
reported that they were unable
to vote and instead had to cast
exception ballots.
In addition to extending the
election for 24 hours, ITS plans
to contact Nursing students to
explain the error and provide
instructions for how to vote,
according to Deshpande's e-mail.
Deshpande added that officials
will vet any exception ballots
cast by Nursing students, and if
the ballots are shown to be valid,
then they'll be counted. In addi-
tion, Nursing students who cast
their ballots won't be able to do so
again.
In an interview last night,
Deshpande said he is working
with ITS to get an accurate pro-
jection of the number of student
voters. He said the large crop of
exception ballots made it difficult
to determine the total number of
voters.
In the student government
election in March, 14 percent of
the student body cast ballots. Last
November, 9 percent of students
voted.
As of 11:59 p.m. night, 11.9 per-
cent - or 2,290 students - voted
in the LSA Student Government
elections. Of the 6,023 Engineer-
ing students who were eligible to
vote in the University of Michi-
gan Engineering Council election,
814 students voted. of the 8,005
eligible Rackham student voters,
583 voted in the Rackham Student
Government. However, because
of the Nursing School and excep-
tion ballots issue, Deshpande said
overall voter turnout for the elec-
tion isn't available yet.
While MSA, LSA-SG, UMEC
and RSG have not collaborated in
previous elections, the governing
bodies worked together this elec-
tion cycle in an attempt to sig-
nificantly increase student voter
turnout.
Rather than promoting one spe-

cific student government election,
MSA, LSA-SG, UMEC and RSG
urged students to vote through
Facebook, e-mails and posting fly-
ers around campus.
Last night, 32 representatives
were elected to MSA.
The majority of candidates
for LSA representatives to MSA
came from the Defend Affirma-
tive Action Party, MForward and
Michigan Vision Party. Eleven
candidates ran under the Defend
Affirmative Action Party, 10 can-
didates ran under the MForward
and six candidates ran under the
Michigan Vision Party.
In the MSA all campus elec-
tion, LSA senior Rebecca Egler
of MForward was elected to fill
the open position on the DPS
Oversight Committee, accord-
ing to unofficial results. The DPS
Oversight Committee reviews
grievances filed against the
Department of Public Safety.
Five students campaigned for
the position including LSA senior
Cory Smith as the Serious Busi-
ness Party candidate, Egler as the
MForward candidate and inde-
pendent candidates LSA freshman
Christina Beckman, LSA sopho-
more David Baird and School of
Public Health graduate student
Katherine Murkowski.
This is the second student-wide
election for the position. In previ-
ous years, MSA appointed student
representatives to the position,
but after an investigation by The
Michigan Daily last year found
the appointment procedure in
violation of a state statute, MSA
revised its election process.
In the LSA-SG election, 16
undergraduate students ran to fill
the 10 open representative spots.
UMEC also elected 10 represen-
tatives to the council. According
to unofficial results, Engineering
senior Kunal Mehta was elected
president of the UMEC and Engi-
neering sophomore Claire Martin
was elected vice president.
In the RSG election, 13 candi-
dates were elected.

Tom Izzo receives
$500,000 raise
Tom Izzo vowed he would be a
"lifer" at Michigan State after turn-
ing down a chance last summer to
coach in the NBA.
Michigan State just made life a
lot more comfortable for Izzo.
Izzo's newly amended contract
gives him a $500,000 raise -
increasing his annual compensa-
tion to $3.49 million - and use of
a private plane for up to 25 hours
each year for personal use. It comes
just a few months after Cleveland
tried to lure him to coach in the
NBA.
"Tom Izzo provides so much
value to the state of Michigan and
to Michigan State that coming up
with his true value is difficult,"
athletic director Mark Hollis said
Thursday. "What we wanted to
do was make sure he's among the
highest-paid coaches in the nation
because I would say he is the best
coach in college basketball.
"If Tom Izzo had left the state, it
would've been like LeBron James
leaving Cleveland - it would've
been a blow - because he's one of
our icons who is from here and
stayed here."
WASHINGTON
Ethics committee
votes 9-1 to censure
Rep. Charles Rangel
The House ethics committee
yesterday recommended censure
for longtime Rep. Charles Rangel,
suggesting that the New York Dem-
ocrat suffer the embarrassment
of standing before his colleagues
while receiving an oral rebuke by
the speaker for financial and fund-
raisingmisconduct.
Censure is the most serious
congressional discipline short of
expulsion. The House, which could
change the recommended disci-
pline by making it more serious or
less serious, probably will consider
the recommendation after Thanks-
giving.
The ethics committee voted 9-1
to recommend censure and that
Rangel pay any taxes he owes on
income from a vacation villa in
the Dominican Republic. The five
Democrats and five Republicans
on the panel deliberated for about
three hours behind closed doors.
WASHINGTON
Troops need more
African language
skills, general says
The Pentagon needs more
troops trained in the cultures and
languages of Africa in order to bet-
ter confront the increasing terror
threat from the continent, a top
general said yesterday.
Army Gen. Carter Ham, who
has been nominated to head U.S.
Africa Command, told a Senate
committee that the threat of ter-
ror from Somalia and other areas
of East Africa is one of the com-
mand's greatest challenges.

And he said that while a number
of Special Operations forces are
trained in African languages and
cultures, the military is not mov-
ing fast enough to provide similar
training to other troops.
Al-Qaida-linked terrorist
groups in Yemen and Africa have
increasingly targeted Western
interests, with al-Shabab in Soma-
lia luring Somali-Americans home
for terror training in hopes of
sending them back to the U.S. to
wage attacks.
MOUNT VERNON, Ohio
Bodies of 2 women,
missing boy found
Three people who vanished
from a blood-spattered home more
than a week ago were found dead
inside a hollow tree Thursday,
days after the teenage daughter
of one of the victims was rescued
- bound and gagged - from the
basement of an ex-convict who
worked as a tree-trimmer.
Authorities said all three were
murdered in the home, though
they did not say how, and the ex-
convict gave information that led
investigators to the bodies in gar-
bage bags in woods in central Ohio.
He remained jailed on kidnapping
charges and was the only suspect
in the killings, Knox County Sher-
iff David Barber said.
"The tragedy today is just
devastating," said Knox County
pronecutor John Thatcher. "The
results aren't what we wanted
them to be."

Fireworks show New technology measures electric

will include 10
minute display
after Big Chill

brain activity in people as they move

From Page 1A
The regents unanimously
voted in favor of having a close-
proximity fireworks display at
the Big Chill at the Big House
- the outdoor hockey game
against Michigan State Univer-
sity to be played at Michigan
Stadium on Dec. 11. The game
is expected to break the world
record for attendance at a hock-
ey game.
The fireworks, which will be
supplied by ACE Pyro, LLC, will
be set off from the roofs of the
new luxury boxes during player
introductions before the game
and during a 10-minute display
after the game, according to a
communication to the regents
from Tim Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president
and chief financial officer. He
wrote that fireworks will also
be shot up from the field after
every Wolverines goal.
"tm told by the Athletic
Director (David Brandon) that
to further enhance the fan expe-
rience we'd like to display some
close proximity fireworks,"
Slottow said at yesterday's
meeting. "We're going to have
a demonstration here today, no
just kidding."
Slottow assured the regents
that all precautions will be
taken to ensure the safety of the
display.
"This has been extensively
reviewed with the fire marshal,
with the general counsel and
with risk management," Slot-
tow said. "We've run these guys
through all the paces, and the
Ann Arbor Fire Department,
(too)."
State law requires that the
regents approve any such fire-
work displays, and the regents
expressed concern that any
future requests for fireworks
would have to be brought before
them for a vote.
Suellyn Scarnecchia, vice
president and general counsel
of the University, said such mat-
ters would be brought before
the regents at least once more.
"We brought this one because
it was the first request (for
close-proximity fireworks),"
Schrnecchia said. "Our intent is
to bring a second one the next
time they wish to do it and have
that blanket approval for a peri-
od of time. We think that we can
do that under state law."

In addition to the activities,
volunteers visited Ann Arbor
restaurants with gender-neutral
bathrooms and gave them win-
dow decals that indicate the
presence of those bathrooms.
"This way, when people are
walking around looking for
somewhere to eat they can know
where there's a restroom they

can feel safe using," Sherry said.
In addition to the Spectrum
Center, LGBTQ student groups
like OUTbreak - an organiza-
tion that works to bridge the gap
between the LGBTQ and School
of Public Health communities
- put on various events for the
week.
"I think for this year our goal
was to make sure that students
are putting on the events that
they want to see," Sherry said.
"We try to have a diverse group
of people - people who iden-
tify as transgender, people who
identify as allies, people with
other varying identities - to get
a multitude of perspectives."
Sherry said overall, the group
of participants has been very
diverse.
"We had undergraduate stu-
dents, graduate students, com-
munity members," he said.
"There really is a strong trans-
gender community in Ann
Arbor and we're sort of capi-
talizing on the strength of that
comm nity."

of the MLB.
As part of the renovations,
the former space of the Lan-
guage Resource Center, which
is now located in North Quad-
rangle, will be turned into the
LSA Instructional Support
Services Media Center, cur-
rently in an off-campus build-
ing rented by the University,
according to Slottow. Addition-
ally, Slottow told the regents
at yesterday's meeting that
the film editing studios in the
media center will be moved to
the MLB.
"This is a follow up from the
opening of North Quad that
allows us to request approval to
proceed with a $2-million proj-
ect to renovate 24,000 square
feet of the MLB building to cre-
ate classrooms, offices and film
editing rooms," Slottow said.
Construction is expected to
be completed next summer.

- the result of a $1.4- million
donation by Athletic Director
David Brandon and his wife Jan,
as well as investment returns
and funds from the School of
Education - will be created
through a repurposing of stor-
age space in the School of Edu-
cation building. The project is
expected to be completed next
autumn.
REGENTS APPROVE
WINTER COMMENCE-
MENT SPEAKER
The regents also unani-
mously approved the Winter
Commencement speaker and
honorary degree recipients.
Nobel laureate Daniel Kahn-
eman, who won the 2002 Nobel
Prize in economics for his
groundbreaking Prospect The-
ory, will be the commencement
speaker, in addition to receiv-
ing a Doctor of Science degree.
Kahneman developed the theo-
ry at the University as a visiting
scientist in the mid-1960s.
"It's very wonderful, and I'm
very happy that he's going to be
the speaker," Coleman said of
Kahneman in an interview last
week.
World-renowned astronomer
Sandra Faber will be awarded
a Doctor of Sciences degree,
and Charles Munger, a Univer-
sity alum and vice chairman
of investment firm Berkshire
Hathaway, will be presented a
Doctor of Laws degree.
Students who hadn't partici-
pated in LGBTQ community-
sponsored events in previous
years also took part in the week's
events.
LSA junior Garrett Descote-
aux-Friday said he decided to
attend a screening of the film
"Transgeneration" as part of
Transgender Awareness Week
after hearing about it from his
Sexuality in Western Culture
professor.
"I was just hoping to learn
more in general about the topic,"

he said.
Tonight there will be a cer-
emony commemorating people
who lost their lives because
of their gender identities. The
ceremony recognizes the Inter-
national Transgender Day of
Remembrance - an event that's
been taking place for 15 years.
This year marks the ninth
time the University has com-
memorated the day. The names
of those who died will be read at
the ceremony, along with a brief
description of what happened
to them. Last year, 100 people
attended the event.
The goal of the week, as well
as an overall aim of the Spec-
trum Center, is to educate all
students, regardless of their
involvement with the LGBTQ
community, Sherry said.
"Wemarea space where you
can tome and sort of admit what
you don't know," he said, "and
talk to someone whose job it is
to help you to understand things
that you may not have ever been
I exposed to."

Technique
created at 'U' may
be used to harness
brain activity
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
Researchers from the Universi-
ty's School of Kinesiology and the
Swartz Center for Computational
Neuroscience at the University of
California, San Diego have devel-
oped a new, noninvasive technol-
ogy to measure and potentially
harness electrical brain activity in
moving people.
According to a press release
issued by the University earlier
this month, the technology allows
scientists to identify when and
where impulses occur in the brain
by recording subjects' movements
in natural environments. In the
past, electrical brain activity could
only be measured in stationary
subjects.
Rackham student Joseph Gwin,
a graduate research assistant in
the School of Kinesiology and the
Department of Mechanical Engi-

neering who worked on the proj-
ect, wrote in an e-mail interview
that he and his research colleagues
have been able to examine brain
function during physical steps.
"(Our) techniques enable us to
study the neural control of move-
ment in ways never before pos-
sible," he wrote.
School of Kinesiology Associ-
ate Prof. Daniel Ferris, a primary
researcher on the project, said the
new technology's ability to dis-
tinguish between various neural
signals provides a unique way of
looking at the brain.
He added that there is potential
for applying the technology to a
number of fields, including medi-
cine.
"Patients with Parkinson's dis-
ease often suffer from freezing
gait, in which they physically lock
up and can't move anymore," he
explained. "Eventually we can see
installing some type of deep brain
stimulator to prevent freezing gait
from happening."
He added that the United States
military has also shown interest in
the research thanks to its potential
practicality in the field.
"The military would like to be
able to monitor brain activity of

soldiers ... such as their stress lev-
els or fatigue levels," Ferris said.
Gwin echoed Ferris's state-
ments, adding that there is the
potential for the development of
mobile brain-computer interfaces
- pathways that could allow brain
waves to control a computer or a
physical device - using the tech-
nology.
"Conventionally, brain-com-
puter interfaces have only been
possible under stationary condi-
tions," he explained. "It may now
be possible to develop interfaces
that can be used in dynamic envi-
ronments, such as while walking,
which opens up a whole new world
of possibilities."
Researchers plan to continue
improving this technology, which
Ferris referred to as a "collabora-
tive effort" between private com-
panies and academic researchers.
Gwin wrote that the next step is
to study brain activity during more
complex movement tasks, such as
walking over obstacles.
"It is not out of the realm of pos-
sibility that we could use brain
waves to help control a device that
could restore mobility to people
with severe walking impair-
ments," he wrote.


TRESPASS
From Page 1A
it is "appropriate" for the Office of
General Council to review the tres-
pass policy to determine if it needs
to be updated.
Coleman added that creating the
policy involves balancing a variety
of concerns.
"You're always walking this fine"
line," Coleman said.
Shirvell was given a trespass
order and banned from campus
on Sept. 14 after he showed up to

multiple campus events, including
an MSA meeting, where he called
for Armstrong to resign. Prior to
appearing on campus, Shirvell
attacked Armstrong on his blog
called Chris Armstrong Watch
and accused the MSA President of
promoting a "radical homosexual
agenda" on campus.
On Nov. 5, DPS modified its
trespass order against Shirvell. He
is now allowed on campus, though
ie can't appear at events that it's
reasonably expected Armstrong
will attend and he must leave any
event where he sees Armstrong

present.
The University's undergradu-
ate chapter of the ACLU sent a
letter to Coleman and DPS direc-
tor Ken Magee Tuesday, con-
demning DPS's actions toward
Shirvell and asked the Univer-
sity to review its trespass policy.
In the letter, ACLU-UM officials
said they believe the current tres-
pass policy allows the DPS direc-
tor "wide discretion in issuing
trespass bans."

Diversify graduation
'U' must increase minority enrollment numbers
diverse student body is an important aspect of a uni-
versity. But in spite of having several thousand students
on campus, the University population fails to represent
the country's diversity. The University's Office of the Registrar
released figures last month regarding the demographics of the
University's student population. The underrepresented minor-
ity enrollment rate increased by 1.5 percent for this year. An
increase in the number of underrepresented minority students
is an achievement for the University. But the enrollment rate still
remains lower than it should be. Efforts should be made to reach
out to - and retain - underrepresented minorities.

Back off, Potterheads

In a Oct. 25 article in the Daily, it was
revealed that underrepresented minority
enrollment as well as overall enrollment
was up this year. Reactions from campus
revealed in a Nov. 15 Daily article that the
Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs -
more commonly referred to as MESA -
has met with University officials over the
past year to discuss ways to more actively
recruit underrepresented minority stu-
dents and encourage them to enroll at the
University if accepted. Other organiza-
tions focused on increasing enrollment of
underrepresented students have proposed
that by offering more application fee waiv-
ers, scholarships and financial aid, these
rates may increase further. There have
been concerns that the banning of affirma-
tive action in 2006 is one of the reasons for
low underrepresented minority student
enrollment at the University.
This is the first year since 2003 that the
University has seen an increase in under-
represented minority student enrollment,
according to an Oct. 25 Daily article. The
increase may reflect the increased recruit-
ment outreach to underrepresented minor-
ities. It could also be because this year the
University saw the largest enrollment in its
history and a recent change in the way that
ethnicity figures are collected. Regardless
of the specific reasons for the increase in
minority student enrollment, the Univer-
sity should continue increasing minority
figures by working with campus groups to
reach out to these students.
Though the increase in underrepresent-
ed minority student enrollment is a suc-

cess, improvements can still be made. With
the University seeing its highest enroll-
ment numbers to date this year, minority
students remain a disproportionally small
percentage of the student population.
The University should continue to devote
resources to bringing underrepresented
minority students to Ann Arbor. MESA,
members of the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, the Office of the Provost and
the Center for Educational Outreach have
been working together to increase minor-
ity recruitment. Multicultural groups have
also been active in encouraging underrep-
resented minority students to apply to the
University. These efforts should be main-
tained so that these students continue
enrolling in the University.
But increasing acceptance rates for
underrepresented minorities is a hol-
low victory if these students continue to
have low matriculation and graduation
rates. There was a gap of about 19 per-
cent between the graduation rates of black
and white students here at the University
between 2001 and 2006, according to a
2008 Education Sector report. The Uni-
versity should work with MESA and stu-
dent groups throughout campus to create a
stronger support system to help these stu-
dents make it to commencement.
Even though the University saw an
increase in underrepresented minority
enrollment this year, more can be done
to improve diversity on campus. The Uni-
versity should continue to work to attract
underrepresented minority students -
and keep them through graduation.

n case you were wondering
what my plans are this week-
end (and I'm sure you were), I
know one thing
for sure: they'll
have nothing to do.
with the release of
"Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hal-
lows." And no, it's
not just because
I couldn't find a
date or because
they'll miss me MELANIE
at Singles Bingo KRUVELIS
night, thanks. The
problem? Every-
one - and I mean
everyone - apparently has no shame
in wanting to be a fictional wizard
virgin. And it's taking over my Face-
book news feed.
Pardon me for this digression, but
I'd like to take a quick moment here
to kindly ask if the Quidditch Team
wouldn't mind setting down their
broomsticks - ouch, dammit, that's
my arm. And hey, if you kids from
the Honors College could kindly
put down those calculators aimed
directly at my forehead, I'd greatly
appreciate it. To be honest, I can't tell
if I'm more terrified or impressed -
seriously, how did you all fit into my
dorm room?
Look, I'm not here to argue the lit-
erary value of a children's novel. So
please take a deep artificial breath
from your inhaler and relax, all you
Potterheads. After all, I read the
books too and it's not the lack of
character development, the repeti-
tive plot or the overused archetypes
that bother me. It's the buildup for
a children's movie that's driving me
berserk.
The problem began several weeks
ago. I was in the back of my political

science lecture trolling the Internet
when I noticed a particularly disturb-
ing Facebook status: "Harry Potter is
the single definition of our genera-
tion, and I love it." Maybe this alone
wouldn't be a cause for concern, but
then I noticed the amount of atten-
tion this status received: there were
over a dozen likes. Suddenly I felt
nauseous - and it wasn't just my tra-
ditional breakfastofleftover ham and
Pop-Tarts at work.
I know you love the movies, and I
don't have a problem with that, hon-
est. But seriously, the definition of our
generation? The baby boomers had
The Beatles and Woodstock. Genera-
tion X had MTV. And we get Harry
Potter? Come on, people! There's
much more to Generation Y-Bother
than a teenage wizard who can never
seem to get laid. What about child-
hood obesity? The destruction of
our atmosphere? "Jersey Shore?" I'd
rather have Snookie as our poster
child - at least she has some sub-
stance (correction: substance abuse
problems).
What's worse is no one seems to be
ashamed of this desire to be a wizard.
For the past several weeks, my entire
news feed has been jam-packed with
Potter. Quiz results confirming that
you do indeed belong in Hufflepuff
(tough break, kid), countless wall posts
whining about acceptance letters to
Hogwarts that must've been lost in
the mail - this is not the Facebook I
know and love. Where are the embar-
rassing photos of my ex-boyfriend,
drunken updates from hallmates and
general ignorance? Harry Potter's
renewed popularity is ruining my abil-
ity to effectively creep, leavingme with
nothing left to do but drink chocolate
milk and listen to Dido by myself.
Even old people are buying into the
phenomenon, posting status after sta-

tus about how groovy Albus Dumb-
ledore is. As if it wasn't creepy enough
when our relatives started joining
Facebook, now they want to cash in on
a children's book? In case you haven't
seen this disturbing new development,
here's an actual snippet of my dear old
Uncle Ichabod's status:
"Uncle Ichabod has midnite tix for
HP7!!!!!! Workin on my Hagrid cos-
tume...good thing I don't have a date
for tonite, this costume's gonna take up
at least three seats lol lol"
Sorry, but I don't
buyin tothe Harry
Potter obsession.-
But I digress. The point here is that
all this hubbub is over a children's
novel. Sure, it's all fine and dandy
to reminisce over some book series
that was a substitute for friends back
when you were in elementary school.
But come on, isn't it time to grow up?
Aren't we a little too old for this non-
senseThere's a worldoutside of Harry
Potter, a beautiful place vhere literary
worth isn't defined by dressing up in
costumes. It's a poetic kingdom with
depth, vision, meaning and beauty in
which we become submerged in the
prose of -
Whoops,I almostexceededmyword
limit. Well, you get my point. It's time
we move beyond the juvenile and head
toward the sublime, where we find the
truth - ah, wait, has anyone seen my
copy of "New Moon?"

Bring arts back

On Nov. 12, Hill Auditorium played host
to the largest student run production in the
nation. The Indian American Student Asso-
ciation put on its annual cultural show for a
sold out crowd. This year's show - Samasti:
Elements of Illusion - featured nine different
dance styles from all over India. It included
everything from iconic Bollywood to tradi-
tional Indian Classical to a fusion combining
both East and West. For the 4,000 individuals
in the audience, it was a night of mesmerizing
costumes, songs and performances.
I was both a spectator and a performer for
this grand event. While I had heard a lot about
the "amazing" show that IASA puts on, this
was my first time actually witnessing it. I was
taken aback by how well organized everything
was. Even with over 200 participants and thou-
sands of audience members wandering around
Hill Auditorium, there was little to no chaos.
Everyone was seated or taken backstage in an
orderly fashion, by the time the show began.
And the overall presentation was very pro-
fessional - each dance was introduced by short
videos. Also thrown into the mix were videos
introducing IASA executive board and the
show coordinators. It speaks volumes about
the University that students put together such
a polished production. Everything from adver-
tising to coordinating technology to providing
holding rooms and food for the participants
was taken care of by the students. The months
up to the show featured many late nights for
the show coordinators chalking, flyering and
managing dress rehearsals, but this dedication
and initiative paid off. Both the IASA board
and the show coordinators do a phenomenal
job each year making sure the show lives up to
its reputation and hype.
And if I've learned anything being a part of
an IASA dance, it's that tlsfxe's a lot of hype. I

was a part of the Bollywood dance this year -
yes, we "taught you how to Bolly." What struck
me the most was that being in a dance wasn't
simply learning the steps and performing,
which was the case in previous performances
I've participated in. It wasn't just about prac-
ticing and getting the choreography. It was
about meeting all different people and building
relationships that will last long after the show
has ended.
In the months leading up to the show, I
found a new family here at the University - my
Bollywood family. And, the same can be said
for any of the nine dances. Each dance made up
its own chant, held "bondings" and got t-shirts
and sweats. We not only danced the steps, we
belted out every word of the songs and smiled
until our faces hurt. We bonded over sore legs
and sleepless nights. Going to practice every
night at Mason Hall was not just a part of my
daily routine, but also a much anticipated event
- I got to dance off the stress of a long day and
see all my new friends.
Participating in the IASA show is the expe-
rience of a lifetime. The show in itself is the
epitome of students coming together to create
something magical. It stands as a testimony to
what dedication and hard work can produce.
It's a display of Indian culture, reflecting the
rich diversity that exists within the nation
itself. But above all, it's a chance to form some
of the most amazing friendships one will find
here at the University.
If you missed it this year, I highly suggest
attending next year or checking out the videos
of the dances on YouTube. And if you were shy
this year or didn't have the time, really con-
sider participating next year. It will be the best
two-and-a-half months of your life.

Creativity has come under attack in our nation's educa-
tion system. Detroit Public Schools are a prime example
of this ill-fated trend. Budget cutbacks have forced many
schools to downsize tremendously at the expense of art
programs.
Unfortunately, students are the victims - particu-
larly those who excel in the arts rather than traditional
academic subjects. It is obvious that math, science and
literature will never be obsolete - we need their help
to instill continuity and convergence in thinking pat-
terns. But creative endeavors play an equally important
role in cognitive development and real world applica-
tion. Improvisation and the ability to think non-linearly
are imperative. For this reason, we need a paradigm shift
that emphasizes the importance of arts in our education
systems.
Though the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act labels arts
as a core subject on paper, in practice art programs are
disproportionally eliminated. Today, only 40 percent of
Detroit Public Schools have art teachers - down from 80
percent just 10 years ago. Only 55 percent of schools have
music teachers and the decline is steady. Just last month,
my own mother Phyllis Toles was forced from her art
room to teach a second grade class, to the dismay of her
colleagues and hundreds of students. There was nothing
the principal or parents could do about it.
The overarching problem is that many parents and
administrators fail to consider the elimination of these
programs a salient issue. My mother said, "There is noth-
ing that is not art. Every man-made product we come in
contact with was a design in the head of an artist at some
point. Art is crucial for societal progress." I also agree
with international education advisor Sir Ken Robinson,
who said in a recent speech that emphasized the arts in
education that "creativity is just as important as litera-
cy." And I am not biased because my mother is a former
art teacher. In school, ironically enough, the arts were
always where I got my lowest grades. Seriously.
The arts (music, dance, drama and drawing/painting/
sculpting) are indispensable because of their subjective
nature, which encourages trial and error. This translates
into students attempting various approaches in other life
experiences that may demand creative thought. Mistakes

are often stigmatized in subjects like math and science, in
which there's only one objectively correct answer. With-
out the presence of the arts, preparation for standardized
testing in these subjects and rote memorization stifle cre-
ative impulses. With a creative outlet, students might do
better in all areas of study.
The arts help us grow into productive beings. And it's
no secret that as humans we are most productive when
motivated. Bestselling author and Yale Law graduate
Dan Pink reported in a recent study that optimal moti-
vation consists of the following three things: autonomy
(as opposed to inflexible prompts), mastery (as opposed to
memorization) and purpose (other than achievement for
achievement's sake). The arts embody each component.
Autonomy is the most important of these - the intrin-
sic motivation required for artistic endeavors fosters the
same development of self-direction outside of the class-
room, increasing students' independence.
Emerging from the age of industrialization, it's clear
that our public education systems are outdated. As Robin-
son notes, schools were modeled after the factory system
and the assembly line - with strict bells, departmental-
ized subjects and atomized "workers." In contrast, the
arts engender community and collaborative efforts for
everyone's mutual benefit. Indeed, innovation occurs
when groups work together and are encouraged to
express various perspectives in unique ways.
Many districts around the country have recognized
this problem. And many colleges and universities are
changing the way they train their teachers to better suit
today's non-factory based economy. Some schools - like
Community High School in Ann Arbor - allow students
the option of molding their schooling experience to fit
their personal needs and desires. Until this mode of oper-
ation is readily available to all students, arts programs
must do the best job of fostering personal fulfillment,
creative development and the requirements of motivation
that Pink lists. Eliminating arts from schools is counter-
productive to the paradigmatic shift that our education,
culture and economy are undergoing. It's time to bring
art back.

Since the passage of the film tax incen-

Power

nies based in Michigan itself.
One such company is First Element
Entertainment, a start-up production com-
pany in Detroit. Started by University alum
Adrian Walker, the company works with
film, music and other media, with the goal of
gathering industry professionals together to
bring original forms of entertainment into
the mainstream.
Walker described the fateful meeting at
the University that propelled him to start
the company in Michigan.
"I went to a (business) school event where
Spike Lee was coming to speak to the stu-
dents," he said. "I was able to have a one-on-
one conversation with him and he actually
suggested that instead of trying to go to Hol-
lywood, we should just start up and try to do
our thing here."
About two years later, the company is
prepared to complete its first foray into film
production with the release of "The Art of
Power," which will roll out its red carpet for
a premiere on Nov. 20 at the Michigan The-
ater. The film follows Wesley (Scott Nor-
man), a young D.C. adult who looks to exact

revensge against a powerful senator (Peter
Carey), embroiling two women (Erin Nicole
and Marisa Stober) into his life as his plan
unfolds.
Shot on a miniscule budget in both Michi-
gan and Washington D.C. and starring new-
comers, the film is emblematic of the new
Michigan film industry - small, burgeoning
and ambitious.
. "The production was very large-scale
for our budget," said Walker, who serves as
writer and executive producer for "The Art
of Power." "We ran a skeleton crew in D.C.
of about 16 people, but when we came back
here it probably went up to about 30 people
without extras or actors ... it was basically
12 days production in D.C. and 17 days in
Michigan."
The scale of the production was made
possible by advancements in camera tech-
nology, which allowed the filmmakers to
achieve state-of-the-art picture quality
without investing the time and money asso-
ciated with film stock. The crew shot on the
Red camera, the premiere digital film-alter-
native camera currently taking Hollywood
- and particularly independent filmmaking
- by storm.
"The cost of production would have been
over a million dollars if we had used film
stock," Walker said.
Beyond its production, however, it was
important that almost all post-production
on the film took place in-state, and not just
the incentivized film shoot.
"I feel like incentives are just the cata-
lysts that spur the industry forward," Walk-
er said. "They're not the long-term vision I
think this state should have."
The exception to the Michigan post-
production is the film's score, which fea-
tures two different composers. Half of the
score was recorded in Chennai, India by
The Acoustricks, a group stemming from
the KM Music Conservatory, which is run
by Academy Award-winning composer A.R.
Rahman ("Slumdog Millionaire").

Entertainment hopes to continue producing

"Aida," MUSKET's first musical of the
season, a powerhouse of contemporary
music and ancient themes, bridges its
extremes with a uni-
versal plotline: a love
triangle.
"Aida" has origins Tonight and
in an opera by the tomorrow at
same name. The story 8 p.m., Sunday
focuses on the strug- at 2 p m.
gle of Aida, a Nubian
princess and recently Power Center
captured slave, and Ticketsfrom $7
an Egyptian captain,
Radames, to pursue
their romance while remaining loyal to
their combating countries.
"Aida" fulfilled the producers' crite-
ria of a show that was commercial and
attention-grabbing, as well as artistical-
ly pleasing and comedic. Casting for the
show began during the second or third
week of classes with rehearsals immedi-
ately following.
MUSKET is a student-run theater
group sponsored by the University
Activities Center.
"I feel like Aida was a good compro-
mise, because it's a big show ... but at the
same time not many people have seen
it because it hasn't gone on tours," said
Patrick Fromuth, a senior in the school
of Music, Theatre & Dance and one of
the show's producers.
With music written by Elton John
and Tim Rice, "Aida" covers a broad
spectrum of genres, ranging from
rock to gospel to disco. The powerful
soundtrack will reverberate through the
Power Center via a 14-member student
orchestra.
"The music can be removed from
the musical and out of context it is still
really relevant, and I think that's just

Elton John's genius," said Jake McClory
an MT&D senior and music director for
"Aida." "There's three songs that (Aida
and Radames) sing twice. I thought it
was really repetitive, but when you put
it with the story, it made sense that they
were going through these changes but
feeling the same."
The choreography mirrors the music's
variety of styles, but many of the dancers
had minimal previous experience.
"It's a blessing and a curse to work
with a cast that doesn't have a lot of
dance training, but it's been a beautiful
challenge," said Edith Freyer, a junior in
LSA and MT&D and the show's choreog-
rapher. "It came down to looking sharp
and keeping things simple and trying to
tell a greater story."
"Aida" will still show off beautiful
choreography with a featured dancer,
Sadie Yarrington an LSA and MT&D
senior.
MUSKET's 'Aida'
is modernized with
the addition of
video projections.
"I'm not somebody who really under-
stands dance, but when (Sadie) dances,
I'm just in complete awe," Fromuth
added. "Seeing Sadie and Edith work
truly makes me see the value and the tal-
ent it takes to do all of that."
In addition to the music and dance
spectacles of "Aida," the set design is
augmented with video projections,
which will be operated by two alumni
who came back to the University in
order to use this equipment.

"It's going to be like a movie mixed
with theater, but it's more or less high-
lighting what's happening in the scene,"
said Kathryn Pamula, a Business and
MT&D junior and one of the producers.
"This is where theater is going, and we
have the opportunity to take more risks
than otherwise."
"It's not one of those plays where we
black out and there's a scene change -
its constantly flowing, kind of like our
dreams," added director Richard Gras-
so, an MT&D junior. "We're not remem-
bering everything, but the big impact
moments of the dream."
Evoking this dreamlike narrative
state, the show begins and ends with a
set resembling a modern-day museum.
With the aid of video projectors, the
audience is transported into the hazy
storytelling space that exists for the
majority of the musical. The artifacts
and pieces in the museum will unravel
an ancient Egyptian set in a surreal
fashion.
"It's book-ended with this museum
scene so we can be reminded of the mod-
ern day audience and how this musical is
still relevant to us regardless of the time
period," Grasso said. "It's a timeless
story ... and we can relate to that today
- whether it be through racial segre-
gation, orientation segregation, we can
still see that in modern times."
Bringing "Aida" to a college stage
brings increased relevance, as many of
the themes in the show are applicable
to students, particularly on this campus
with our theme semester, "What makes
life worth living?"
"Not only is it striking and stirring
and sexy, it kind of plays into Mary Sue
Coleman's widening your worldview
and cultural diversity at Michigan,
which we take alot of pride in," Fromuth
said. "The show is kind of a celebration
of crossing those cultural divides."

The title character of "Aida" is a Nubian slave princess.

Not good music

By JASMINE ZHU
DailyArts Writer
Stereolab - an experimental post-rock
band formed in 1990 that created the 1996
sonic gem Emperor Tomato Ketchup -
announced in 2009 that it was going on
hiatus indefinitely, much
to the disappointment of
the band's devoted fan **
base. But less than a year
later, the group is back Stereolab
with a new album, Not Not Music
Music. Unfortunately, Not
Music's content sounds sragly
just as bland and unexcit-
ing as the title implies.
On Not Music, the songs seamlessly shift
from one to the next while Letitia Sadi-
er's breathy vocals blend from English to
French intermittently - and often ideci-
pherably. The album's purpose seems puz-
zling - it doesn't really add anything new
or innovative to Stereolab's discography,
and it's not a fun listen. Kind of an ironic
bummer for a band hailed by The Indepen-
dent as "one of the most fiercely indepen-
dent and original groups of the Nineties."
The album does have its bright moments.
"Silver Sands," remixed by Emperor
Machine, is a 10-minute synth-heavy dance
jam that recalls Stereolab's glory days as a
krautrock-influenced band. The motorik

rhythm is reminiscent of German electron-
icband Kraftwerk's repetitious mechanical
sound. The song has a denser, more fore-
boding feel in comparison to the album's
throwaway tracks.
However, these enjoyable moments are
sparsely found on Not Music. Not that any
of the songs are objectionable - it's only
that they could be much better if the band
returned to its garage-rock roots. "Delu-
geoisie" is about as cheery as a deluge. Sadi-
er drones on while a sagging tempo and
tragic trombone provides the background.
Overall, the album is eminently forget-
table. The "Neon Beanbag" remix that
Atlas Sound provides on the record's final
track is a reminder of this. The original,
which was the first track on Stereolab's
2008 release Chemical Chords, is just bet-
ter. Sorry, Bradford Coix.
Through the years, Stereolab's sound has
devolved from its more innovative roots
toward more inoffensively lighthearted
pop songs. Consequently, listening to
the 13-track LP feels a lot like swimming
through tepid, lukewarm water. It's not an
altogether unpleasant experience, but it's
still relatively mind-numbing. Likewise,
most of the tracks fail to stir listeners'
interest and don't leave much of a lasting
impression. Instead, the album serves only
as a minor ripple in Stereolab's consider-
able discography.

At UMMA, performance
puts the museum on exhibit

By DANIEL CARLIN
For theDaily
When walking through a museum,
it's easy to dismiss the mundane and
irrelevant elements and focus on a
curated journey. How-
ever, the conventional Collections:
concept of "museum- UMMA
going" is challenged
at University of Michi- Saturday at
gan Museum of Art's 1:30 p.m.
latest and one-day-
only show, "Collec- UMMA
tions: UMMA." Free
The site-specific
performance includes
an impromptu score coupled with a
pre-recorded film of UMMA's archi-
tecture. The video, created by School of
Art & Design MFA candidate John Kan-
nenberg, provides a structure for the
live improvisational sounds by various
musicians, including School of Music,
Theatre & Dance professor Stephen
Rush.
While many Art & Design students
travel to UMMA to examine the art-
work behind the cases, Kannenberg
spent his time listening in the galler-
ies. The sounds encouraged him to then
seek the visual oddities around the
museum.
"I've done all of this visual research
around the museum - collecting all of
these images in the museum, which is
everything but the art," he explained.
This unconventional process led him to
create a piece about UMMA itself.
As the project began to unfold, both
the environment and the video dem-
onstrate a sense of new meets old; the
video score is displayed in both the
original building (Apse Gallery) and
the rscently added Maxine and Stuart

Frankel Family Wing (Vertical Gal-
lery). In fact, each frame in Kannen-
berg's video is sliced and shows one
image from each the Apse and Vertical
galleries. He primarily focused on the
tiniest of details that typically remain
unnoticed, like chairs for museum-
goers and case work for exhibit pieces.
The site and film present a clear dichot-
omy between the new and old aspects
of the museum, giving this unconven-
tional piece a sense of familiarity.
"I am setting up a situation where
a group of sound artists can react to
the look and sound of the space at the
same time," Kannenberg said. "So I am
thinking of this as an improvisational
dialogue, with the sound and the visual
aspects of the space, which is filtered
or mediated through this situation that
I've set up - the video."
Kannenberg's interest in the rela-
tionship between sound and images
brought him into the world of "picture
scores," the concept that explores how
an image can affect sound, and vice
versa, when the two are juxtaposed. In
the past, his focus has been on single
images, but he has also been working
to develop a video that can be used as
moving "graphic score."
"(A) graphic score is like taking a
picture and turning it into sound," he
explained, but with multiple images.
There is no canvas needed.
In addition to the video, the exhibit
includes musicians spread throughout
each space, forcing spectators to actu-
ally interact with their surroundings.
"I am directing the gaze of these
musicians and sound artists who are
going to be forming (music)," he stated.
"From there they are going to be both
looking and listening to the space and
reacting to it in an autonomit way."

Though the sound created is
unknown until the show, Kannenberg
expects quieter music that will not
detract from the video or space. Rush,
Kannenberg's former professor, said
he plans to use an eclectic variety of
instruments like the wind instrument
ocarina - not the iPhone application -
and a sopranino trombone, also known
as a slide whistle.
"(I don't have) intentionality about
the performance, but (I) hope that it is
cohesive and provides a good environ-
ment," Rush said.
In 'Collections:
UMMA,' recorded
video meets
improvised sound.
Lisa Borgsdorf, the manager of
UMMA, feels that havingKannenberg's
piece at the museum is an obvious and
appropriate marriage. This symbiotic
relationship provides museum-goers
at UMMA a meta-viewpoint and a new
perspective on the familiar spaces.
"It will be an opportunity for audi-
ences to reflect on the space in a dif-
ferent way because they will be looking
at images of the space that they are in,"
Borgsdof said.
"John is looking at it with a differ-
ent eye, especially by focusing at the
very small details. And I think that will
heighten people's awareness of how
they are interacting with the space -
which is an interesting opportunity for
us."

The program also features pil-
lars of classical repertoire, such as
the overture to Richard Wagner's
opera "The Flying Dutchman." This
orchestral tour-de-force from Wag-
ner's ghostly fourth opera has per-
sonal significance to Maestro Segal.
"It's actually the first piece Iever
conducted with an orchestra," Segal
said. "It was in a rehearsal when
I was, I think, 17 years old. This is
(my) first time actually doing it in
a concert. I love that piece. I think
Wagner is an amazing composer,
how he writes for the orchestra ...
and tells a story using the instru-

Sunday's concert also offers a
rare chance for classical enthusi-
asts to hear a piece by contemporary
Chinese-American composer Bright
Sheng, a composition professor in
the School of MT&D.
"It's called 'Fanfare' from a suite
called China Dreams," Segal said.
"It's also a great thing for us to (play
this piece) because he's aliving com-
poser, he's in the Michigan commu-
nity, he writes for orchestra."
"He's a superb composer and a
superb orchestrator. I think there's
nothing else on the program like
that music," he added.
Pops concerts also give students

in the School of MT&D an oppor-
tunity to show off their vocal per-
formance skills. Sunday's concert
features a performance of Figaro's
famous aria "Largo al Factorum"
from "The Barber of Seville" by
baritone graduate student Steven
Eddy. Senior Rachel Bahler will
perform "Don't Cry for me Argen-
tina," from Andrew Lloyd Weber's
"Evita."
"She's actually sung with us sev-
eral times," Segal saidof Bahler.
"She's like a Pops favorite because
she's amazing."
Segal also stressed that Pops
showcases the talents of students
who may not otherwise get a chance
to perform in an ensemble.
"There's a hundred people on
stage, and the majority of them
are non-music majors," Segal said.
"They juggle their own academic
work, and some of them are gradu-
ate students and nursing students
and Ph.Ds and engineers, and yet
they all love to come together once
or more a week to rehearse for
Pops.'
"I think that they really love play-
ing music, and this orchestra gives
them a vehicle to have a lot of fun
and play exciting music at a high
level," he added. "It's very reward-
ing for me to work with them."

films while alsobranchingoff and
spending more time on its other
media.
First Element COO Robert
Presnell is a second-year MBA in
the Ross School of Business. He
compared the evolution of the
film industry to similar events
in the music industry, when file-
trading of mp3s began in the late
1990s, and firms were slow to
realize the business opportuni-
ties therein.
"Movies and everything going
forward are going to be really
different," he said. "It's going to
be interesting coming up ... see-
ing who makes the first move and
what itis."
Walker echoed the sentiment,
comparing the film industry
going forward to the auto indus-
try of the past few decades.
"I kind of liken it to where (the
auto industry) was at one point in
time," he said. "I feel like a lot of
your biggest players for decades,
if they're not careful, if they fall
asleep, they're going to end up
having a lot of new companies
emerge that end up taking their
place."
First Element Entertainment
hopes for "The Art of Power" to
propel the company forward and
lead it into further endeavors in
film;animation, music videos and

other media.
"We've got about six scripts in
the pipeline," Presnell said.
Before it can move on, though,
First Element's must find a dis-
tributor for "The Art of Power"
after its Saturday premiere at the
Michigan.
"I've been in contact with
about 80 to 90 companies," Walk-
er said. "It's an exciting time (in
the industry); it's crazy right now.
We've been in talks with a lot of
digital media companies who
have never really done film distri-
bution before."
As the industry progresses,
First Element is riding that evo-
lution to position itself within
the state of Michigan as a prime
example of homegrown filmmak-
ing. Modeling itself after early
iterations of corporations like
Apple and 3M, the company hopes
to foster creative ideas internally
and be the next step in the enter-
tainment industry as a whole.
That said, its leaders understand
the challenges of that ambition.
"It's a constant chess game,"
Presnell said.
With the Michigan Theater
premiere of "The Art of Power,"
First Element makes its open-
ing move. With a background of
Michigan alumni and students
involved at different levels, the
company looks well suited to
maneuver itself through a grow-
ing and constantly changing
industry.

Michigan looks to extend

'M' to face Knights

NCAA Tournament

ByMICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Last year, the Michigan hock-
ey team's sweep of Lake Supe-
rior State in the first round of
the CCHA playoffs started a six-
game win streak that earned the
Wolverines an appearance in the
NCAA Tourna-

straight year.

This week-
end's matchup
with Lake Supe-
rior State (3-4-1-0 CCHA, 5-5-2
overall) should be a lot easier on
the Wolverines - they only have
one streak to worry about.
The last time the Lakers won
a game against Michigan was in
early 2007, and the current class
of seniors had yet to enroll at the
University. But this weekend's
main goal isn't about extending
the streak (few, if any, players
actually know about it). It's about
coming away with six points in a
crowded CCHA in which the top
seven teams are separated by just
seven points.
"Obviously you look at the big
events on your schedule like the
Showcase, the Big Chill, the Tour-
nament, stuff like that but when it
comes down to it, every weekend
counts," senior forward Matt Rust

The Wolverines face a home
matchup against Central Florida
(12-4-3) on Sunday afternoon. The
Knights received their first-ever at
large bid to the NCAA Tournament
and are coming off a 3-0 shutout of
Southern Florida in the first round
of the tournament.
The game will be a battle of two
potent offenses, as Michigan and

UCF rank 10th and 12th in the nation
respectively in total team offense.
The Wolverines flashed their bal-
anced striking abilities in their 4-1
rout of Penn State in the Big Ten
Championship game in State Col-
lege. Senior forward Justin Meram
scored two goals for Michigan,
while the Saad brothers - sopho-
more midfielder Hamoody and
freshman forward Soony -rounded
out the scoring attack.
But to stifle UCF's attack, the
Wolverines will rely heavily on their
experienced defenders, starting with
redshirt junior goalkeeper Chris
Blais. Blais made nine saves in Mich-
igan's win over Penn State and led
the Wolverines to a shutout of Wis-
consin the round before. The Seattle
native is a captain this year andlooks
to lead Michigan on Sunday.
Michigan has found success at
home this season, boasting an 8-2-1
record at the U-M Soccer Complex.
Soony leads the nation in goals with
18 and earned the TopDrawerSoc-
cer.com National Player of the Week
award for his performance against
the Nittany Lions. He will try to
help the Wolverines carry their
momentum through to the NCAA
Tournament this weekend.

road stretch.
The Golden
Eagles (2-0) were
ranked in the middle of the Big
East conference prior to the start
of the season. They feature six
seniors and return seven letter-
winners, including three starters.
Heading into the matchup with
Marquette, Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth is imposing a three-item
agenda for his team for Friday's
game.
One main focus is to win the
offensive rebound battle. In Mon-
day night's 85-76 loss to No.5 Xavi-
er, the Wolverines only grabbed
six offensive rebounds to Xavier's
14. Granted, the Musketeers have
two 6-foot-6 All-Americans; but,
height is the name of the game.
"We are going to see Big Ten
teams just like that," Borseth said
after Monday's game against Xavi-
er "Everybody in the Big Ten has
big kids that play and we just have
to get used to that."
If the Wolverines don't adjust
soon, they will pay the price in
points. On Monday, Xavier put
the game away on second efforts,
scoring 22 second-chance points.
When playing tall teams that are
difficult to stop on the defensive
end of the court, the Wolverines
are going to have to put up the
points to match.
Michigan will also need to win
the boards, it will need to play the
entire 40 minutes. In last week's
game against Alcorn State and in
the recent matchup against Xavi-
er, the Wolverines had periods of
lackluster performance.
In the home opener against the
Braves, Michigan went into half-
time with a 41-9 lead. And when
the Wolverines returned to the
court a little flat, Alcorn State
attempted a comeback. Although
Michigan continued to hold a safe
lead, the Braves managed to tally
34 points in just 20 minutes of play.

Trio of Badger backs present big
challenge for Wolverines' defense

He's built more like a refrigerator
than a normal human being. That's
how Wisconsin likes him. After all,

All of those carries weren't for
naught - the junior ran for more than
1,500 yards and scored 18 touchdowns
that year for the Badgers (9-1 overall,
5-1 Big Ten). He then spent time in the
offseason recovering from surgery on
both of his ankles.
Clay - the 2009 Big Ten Offensive
Player of the Year - is uncertain for
Saturday as he is still recovering from
a sprained knee suffered two weeks
ago.
He's still listed as the starter, but
he now has two young hot shots nip-
ping at his heels and vying for carries
in freshman James White and sopho-
more Montee Ball.
White could be described as the
speed to Clay's bruiser. And Ball is
somewhere between the two.
The sixth-ranked Badgers' plan
has always been simple: find the big-
gest, strongest offensive linemen, geta
great running back and pound the ball.

When I was in the zone, I took on
qualities that no longer paralleled the
qualities of the Troy character people
previously knew. I personally think
this other character is a little crazy.
For example, where do you think my
paws tattoos came from? I don't like
pain, so that was not my idea. He
clearly made that decision. I needed
to clear up the confusion so I decided
to give the person you see on the field
a name, and the name I chose was
T-Woolf. T-Woolf is only about two
years old now.
My senior year during fall camp

"It all starts with their running
game," Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez said on Monday. "They'll come
downhill at you. They're very big up
front. They've got big backs, big tight
ends. They'll pound you and do a great
job blocking on the perimeter with
their wideouts. So you've got to be able
to stop that. I think everything comes
off of that - their bootlegs, their play-
action passes and all that start when
they can run the ball effectively. When
they can do that, they've been good
against everybody they've played."
Wisconsin's offensive line is con-
sidered one of the best in the country,
anchored by a senior left side of tackle
Gabe Carimi, John Moffitt and Bill
Nagy, with Carimi the most heralded
of the group. He was an All-Big Ten
performer last year and was on every-
one's preseason All-American list in
2010.
"I love watching, when we're break-
ing down film, watching the Wiscon-
sin games," fifth-year senior guard
Steve Schilling said. "They've always
got greatoffensive linemen. If you ever
watch the other defenses go against
them, it helps me. Especially watch-
ing Carimi and Moffitt on the left side,
(they're) two of the best in the nation
at their positions. So I think I'm going
to watch them."
Last week against Indiana, that
line paved the way for a huge day.
The Badger offense scored on every
single offensive possession, notching
83 points. White and Ball combined to
run for more than 300 yards and five
touchdowns while Clay sat out with an
injury.
The Wolverines (7-3, 3-3) have been
gashed for 164 yards per game and
Clay, combined with Bell and Mon-
tee, could pose problems for the home
T-Woolf became as perfect as a play-
er as anyone could be. He was in the
best shape of his life - the fastest and
strongest he had ever been. It seemed
as if every day during camp he would
make a greatplay. Scouts were coming
to look at him and everything.
One day about a week and a half
into camp, T-Woolf was practicing like
every other day. It wasn't a two-a-day,
so we were in full pads and hitting.
Toward the end of practice, we were
simulating a two-minute drill to get
us accustomed to pressure situations.
The offense hiked the ball and the
tight end, Kevin Koger, caught it after
running an out pattern. T-Woolf saw

Junior defensive tackle Mike Martin and the Michigan defense will have their hands full with the Wisconsin running game.

team's defense. But the team is coming
off of its best defensive performance
of the season, a 27-16 win over Purdue
last Saturday in West Lafayette.
Michigan held its opponent to fewer
than 20 points for the second time this
season while playing without two of
their best defensive players: junior
nose guard Mike Martin (ankles) and
senior linebacker Jonas Mouton (chest
muscle). Martin fully participated in
practice on Wednesday and Mouton
was limited. Rodriguez said he was
"hopeful" they would return against
Wisconsin and both players were list-
ed as "probable" on Thursday's injury
report.
Martin and Mouton sure would
remember. Right before the point of
explosion, another offensive player
hit T-Woolf from the side with just
enough force to knock him off balance,
causing him to fall to his side. Before
T-Woolf was hit, he planted his right
foot into the ground to help explode
off after expecting to hit the ball carri-
er. As T-Woolf's body tumbled over to
the side, his foot was still planted into
the ground. His foot couldn't move
with the body, and it couldn't take
the pressure. This caused his ankle
to violently come out of socket, tear-
ing the tendons inside. If that wasn't
bad enough, he found out later he also
broke his leg.
T-Woolf was in tremendous pain,
but it didn't stop there. It was vital to

help in defending the run. It will be
key for Michigan to get off blocks and
make tackles on the Badger's running
backs - the Wolverines will have to
match Wisconsin's physical play.
"If they want to come out and play
hard-nosed football and run up the
middle, we're just going to have to man
up and just play with them," senior
cornerback James Rogers said.
In recent weeks, the Wolverines
have swarmed to the football and
stopped opponents quickly, even if the
runner broke the initial tackle. Young-
er players have stepped into starting
roles and shown energy, too. Junior
linebacker J.B. Fitzgerald, redshirt
sophomore linebacker Kenny Demens
get the ankle back in socket, because
the longer it is out, the more danger it
can do to the leg. The trainers prepped

place. The trainer said, "on the count.
to three, I am going to pull.1 ... 2 ... 3."
He then violently pulled T-Woolf's
foot. T-Woolf was in extreme agony
but you couldn't tell by looking at his
face. You could only tell by looking at
the insanely tight grip he had on two
people who were holding his hands for
support. From their grimacing faces,
you would think T-Woolf's friends
were in more pain than T-Woolf.
It took the trainer two more
attempts, and on the third, T-Woolf

and freshman safety Ray Vinopal
haven't been afraid to stick their noses
around the ball.
But tackling Clay isn't fun for any-
one.
He has rushed for 929 yards and 13
touchdowns this season. White has
scored 11 touchdowns and averages
nearly seven yards per carry. And Bell
has more than 500 yards and nine
touchdowns, despite being listed as
the third running back on the depth
chart.
Rogers was confident that the
defense was up for the challenge of
Clay and the Wisconsin offense.
"He ain't bigger than Ron Dayne,"
he said.
could no longer hide the pain. He let
out a yell. Then he started to laugh
between screams of pain. The trainer
pulled and pulled, and all of a sudden
a "pop" was heard, and his ankle was
back in place.
He doesn't know at this point that
he also has a broken bone, so T-Woolf's
first words were, "Thanks, OK now
let me finish practice." But since the
paramedics were on their way, he had
to go to the hospital.
The paramedics came and put him
on the stretcher and carted him off to
the hospital. T-Woolf has not been seen
since, but his return will be better than
ever. All the receivers acrossthe nation
dread the day T-Woolf steps back onto
the field.

Two bizarre weeks, two bizarre wins. After a 132-point, triple-
overtime marathon, the Wolverines came out and played their
best defense of the year. Weird, right? So now, they have some-
thing to prove in the last two weeks. Wisconsin just scored 83
points. Ohio State is still Ohio State. The easy ones are definitely
over. For Michigan, it's crunch time.

2010 Schedule

Connecticut (Sept. 4): Denard ran all over
UConn. He proved he could pass the ball too,
and Rich Rod's hot seat began to cool down.
Notre Dame (Sept. 11): After UConn, the ND
game was Denard's encore on steroids, with a
game-winning drive.
Massachusetts (Sept. 18): Michigan squeaked
by the Minutemen, winning by less than a touch- IL
down. A win is a win is a win.
Bowling Green (Sept. 25): Michigan piled on the
points against the Falcons, somewhat curing the
Massachusetts hangover.V
Indiana (Oct. 2): The Wolverines survived their
first Big Ten test - but defense was once again
suspect. Denard saved the day with 494 yards.
Michigan State (Oct. 9): The game itself didn't
live up to the hype, due to Denard's three INT. It
was over by halftime, State's third in a row.

Iowa (Oct. 16): Michigan looked to rebound
from arguably its worst loss in two years. Iowa's
vaunted front four stood in the Wolverines' way.
Penn State (Oct. 30): Oh, Matt McGloin. Penn
State's walk-on-at-quarterback experiment
worked a little better than 08-09 Michigan's.
Illinois (Nov. 6): More than 100 points, 10 turn-
overs, and all I got was this stupid win. Just kid-
ding, Michigan will take any late conference win.
Purdue (Nov. 13): The Boilermakers did some-
thing no one has done all season: Make Michi-
gan's defense look good.
Wisconsin (Nov. 20): After putting up 83 points
against Indiana, Michigan's 'D' must be shaking
in their boots.
Ohio State (Nov. 27): In a perfect world, Michi-
gan may be going for its ninth win here. But the
Wolverines don't need a reason to try in Columbus.

y dad played in the NFL for about eight years. To
make it to that level in football, you have to have an
edge over the millions of other players across the
country with whom you're competing for the chance to go pro.
Fortunately for my dad, he had enough edge to sell to the high-
est bidder. He was fast, strong and tall, but most important, he
was fearless. My father played running back, and on the field he
played like a man among boys. It was as if he went into an ani-
mal-like zone where he was a predator and his prey was waiting
for him in the end zone. Nothing would stop him from eating.
This zone that he would tap into whenever he stepped on the
field is actually a trait that is carried down the family line. We're
African American mixed with Native American. The tribe from
which my family descends worshipped a powerful creature that
rules the night and strikes fear in its potential victims with every
howl. This animal is a wolf. The people of my tribe would emu-
late the wolf lifestyle, copying the way it hunts and travels in
packs. Among males in the tribe there was a gene shared only by
a few random tribe members.
This gene allowed the individual to actually take on the
aggressive nature of a wolf, its focus, senses and its animalistic
ways. This was notpermanent, and it was notsomethingthatyou
could simply turn on when you wanted to. It is only triggered in
order to help the body in times of need. For example, the body
needs food, so ifa host carryingthis gene hadn't eaten in a while
and was hungry, he would go in the zone in search for food. This
gene can lie dormant in a kid's bodyuntil he has reached his ado-
lescent years and sometimes even later.
Since my dad played sports, he was adamant that I played a
sport. He figured speed is essential for every sport, so I started
running track at a very young age. With some good coaching
from my dad mixed with some of his genes, I became one of the
top sprinters in the nation. By the time Ihit high school, I started
playing football and seemed naturally good at it. I began to get
scholarship letters from schools. I made my dad proud, but there
was just one thing that my dad hated that held me back from

reaching my full potential as an athlete.
The problem was that I was too silly. I have been the class
clown my whole life. My parents received numerous phone calls
about me making jokes causing other students to laugh, creating
a huge disruption in class. It was an ongoing problem on the foot-
ball field as well. Before the play would start, I would dance or
do something silly like that and not even know the play started,
which would cause me to give up a touchdown. I was just never
focused or ready to play. Luckily, my ability still offered me a
chance to go to college regardless of my flaws.
When I got to Michigan and started practicing with the rest of
the players on the team, I realized that I seriously needed to make
some changes. My silliness started to get me into even more trou-
ble on the field, ranging from punishments to missed assignments.
It wasn't until the end of my sophomore year during spring
ball that I started to change. I remember it like it was yesterday.
When I got home from practice one night, I received a call from
my coach, who told meI got the starting job at my position. I was
ecstatic. That whole night I couldn't sleep, I just kept imagin-
ing gameday and what it would be like coming onto the field and
playing in front of the big crowd.
The next day in practice I was extremely nervous because I
That night I stayed up for
hours pondering what was
going on and what happened to
me. Then I finally realized - I,
too, was blessed with the gene
of my family's ancient tribe.

could just feel the coaches' eyes grilling me to see whether they
made the right decision in giving me the starting job. I could feel
my hands violently shaking as if I was in the middle of Alaska
butt-naked with nothing but one sock on. When I finally made it
to the field after purposely taking my precious time in the locker
room, my violent shaking amplified, making it nearly impossible
for me to put on my gloves.
The whistle blew to start the play, and all of a sudden, a sense
of calmness came over me. I was no longer nervous or worried
about living up to the expectations of my coaches. The only thing
I was focused on was the football and my assignments. When the
receiver came off the ball, he tried to give me a juke move to get
me to open my hips the wrong way. When he did it, it was as if
time suddenly slowed down so I could watch his every move in
slow motion. I didn't know what was going on. I thought he was
tired or something so I asked him. He became angry, thinking
I was trying to insult him after locking him down on the play. I
was kind of glad though, because I knew that on the next play he
would give it his all to get revenge for what he perceived as trash
talking. But the next play was the repeat of the previous one: he
came off the ball and tried to juke me and once again it appeared
to be in slow motion.
That night I stayed up for hours pondering what was going on
and what happened to me. Then I finally realized - I, too, was
blessed with the gene of my family's ancient tribe. Due to the fact
that football is a competitive sport, my body felt as if it was being
threatened by the opponent, which triggered the wolf gene to
come out. The next day and for the rest of spring ball, my gene
became stronger and stronger within me. It startled my team-
mates because it was as if I was an entirely different person on
the field from who I was off the field. My friends were used to
the regular, silly, making-people-laugh Troy. They didn't know
what happened to me once I stepped on the field, because there
I was, strictly business with no room for smiles - mean, aggres-
sive and feisty.

TROY
From Page 5
Even though T-Woolf will be absent, Troy
will be on the sidelines coaching and
cheering for Michigan till all the air has
vacated my lungs.
!7sArg : a m .d.a cof0on.
Troy's injury hits junior wide receiver Darryl
Stonum nearly as hard as it does Rodriguez.
"I think I took it worse than (Troy) did," Sto-
num says. "When I went back to the room, I was
getting teary-eyed for him. He was smiling, say-
ing, 'You all go out there and do what you're sup-
posed to do.' He kept his spirits up better than
I did."
As teammates grapple with the reality of the
injury, Troy heads to the hospital. On the way, he
texts his father, Butch.
"I think my season's over," he writes as the
shock of the afternoon's event wears off.
Butch calls his son to make sure he isn't kid-
ding. Troy's a jokester, but this isn't a laughing
matter.
A few days later, after Butch and his wife
Regina fly up to Ann Arbor from Sugar Land,
Texas, Troy undergoes surgery for a dislocat-
ed ankle and broken fibula at the University of
Michigan hospital.
Regina stays with Troy for a few days. Butch
stays for a week longer. It's a tag-team effort,
they say.
Butch cooks for his son, cleans the apartment
and walks "the damn dog." The damn dog - as
Butch calls it - is Julius, a mixbetween alab and
a beagle. After Butch leaves, he hires someone to
come walk Julius twice a day.
Butch says: "It was pretty easy when I was
there. ... It's after those two weeks that it got
hard."
"I was basically bed-ridden," Troy says. "I
couldn'tget up and do stuff because IShad to keep
my leg elevated."
Troy watches the pounds slip off his six-foot
frame. He drops 20 pounds in the first month,
and his legs get skinny.
All he can do is lie around with his right leg
up and watch his body deteriorate, a body that
had been so fit and so ready for a strong senior
season.
"That's the worst part of it because this sum-
mer, I put the time in," Troy says. "I stayed in the
weight room. I stayed on the field trying to get
my speed up. To have it all taken away from you
is just a big slap in the face. It makes it seem like
I wasted all that time. IShave to go back and doit
all over again."
The physical struggle is an uphill battle. But
according to Butch, the mental recovery could be
the hardest part. That's what he has to prepare
his son for.

that has since been surpassed.
But he's also no stranger to devastating inju-
ries. Butch's seven-year NFL career ended in
1988 when he blew out his knee in the Detroit
Lions' third game of the season. Surgery fol-
lowed, but he never made it back onto a profes-
sional football field.
So Butch knows a little something about lying
in a hospital room, watching his own football
career turn into a major question mark. But the
football questions take a backseat to the emo-
tional ones.
"He was just telling me that people are going
to start to fade away - all your friends are going
to fade away from you," Troy says. "Life is going
to change from the way you know it now. You
just have to expect that. Expect people to go
away from you so you won't be hurt."
Butch encourages Troy to stay connected -
go watch practice, watch game film, give the
defensive backs pointers.
"Injured players can really get lost and sepa-
rated from the team," Butch says. "I didn't want
that to happen for him."
Troy lives alone - well, besides Julius. Since
he doesn't like living with roommates, he doesn't
really get to see his teammates as much during
his rehab process.
It's not just the living arrangement, though.
It's the out-of-sight, out-qf-mind way college
students naturally act.
"I don't think it's a conscious decision of peo-
ple just leaving, it's just that since they can't ben-
efit from knowing you in a certain way, they just
tend to forget about you," Troy says. "Some of my
close friends even on the football team don't call
as much, don't talk or anything.
"Iunderstand. It could be just because they're
busy with the season now. I was always so busy
myself."
There's no sense of sadness in Troy's eyes. His
voice remains steady. He knows it's just a fact of
post-injury life.
But as November rolls around and upper-body
workouts pick up, Troy runs into his teammates
more often in Schembechler Hall. Rodriguez
says he -sees Troy in the weight room nearly
every day.
"It's probably hard when you're first injured
because you want to be in there and you feel like,
'Man, I should be playing.' It's hard to watch
- especially Troy, because he's a competitor,"
Rodriguez says.
Teammates laugh when they talk about how
hard Troy has worked to be around the team
as much as possible. They say he likes to drive
Rodriguez's golf cart around the practice field -
anything to be close to the action.
Off the field, Troy still sees some teammates
on a regular basis. He and Stonum, who have
been close since their days as teammates at Dull-
es High School in Texas, play video games and
spend time at each other's places often.
But life is a little quieter now. And noth-
ing makes Troy feel more alone than watching
Michigan football games from the stands or his
couch.

Michigan gives up consecutive touchdowns,
and suddenly the Hawkeyes have a command-
ing 21-7 lead. The Wolverines are on their way
to losing their second game of the season as
Iowa picks apart Michigan's secondary.
"To watch Tiny watch a Michigan football
game on TV, I mean, he's workingit like acoach
- except he doesn't havea headset on and can't
make any calls," Butch says. "He's criticizing
the defense, being critical of the good things
they do, the bad things they do. 'He's out of
position right here.' 'Do this right here.' 'Come
up and hit him.'"
During games, Troy has to find a way to
relieve these frustrations. Good thing his cell
phone is an arm's reach away. And that phone
has a Twitter app.
Troy jokes that it's not always the best idea
to tweet during games. He's landed himself in
trouble for messages like "Kicker wanted" -
a tweet sent after Seth Broekhuizen missed a
field goal against Massachusetts to make the
Wolverines 1-for-5 on the season.
Some of Troy's most frustrating moments,
however, come when he's watching the defense
- or more specifically, the secondary.
"The hardest part is just looking at the games
and seeing how I would be able to impact the
team, make them that much better," Troy says.
"I see our defense struggling. I feel like it's kind
of my fault because of my injury, and I can't
help them out."
Troy says he didn't mind watching the Con-
necticut game, when the defense let up 10
points. But starting the next Saturday at Notre
Dame, opponents began tossing touchdowns
at will. Even backup quarterbacks, like Penn
State's Matt McGloin, put up near-Heisman
stats against the Wolverine secondary.
Excluding the Connecticut and Purdue
games, Michigan surrenders more than 36
points per game.
Troy started every game last year - six at
corner, six at safety - and posted a career-best
46 tackles.
Teammates notice Troy's absence on a daily
basis, not just in games.
"Normally, corners are kind of quiet.
They're not physical or aggressive in the way
you think a linebacker or defensive lineman
would be," redshirt junior defensive end Ryan
Van Bergen says. "But Troy brings a really
aggressive attitude, mentality to the second-
ary. I think a lot of guys look to him for leader-
ship by example."
The Wolverines planned on leaning on that
aggression on and off the field in 2010. In the
offseason, All-Big Ten cornerback Donovan
Warren passed on his final season at Michi-
gan to enter the NFL Draft. Justin Turner, the
team's highest-rated cornerback out of high
school, left the program before the season got
underway.
Once Woolfolk goes down, the secondary
is left with paper-thin - and young - depth.
Fifth-year senior James Rogers, a career back-
up who has shuffled between wide receiver
and cornerback the past four years, is the lone
upperclassman left on the depth chart.
Redshirt sophomore J.T. Floyd starts in
Woolfolk's place until Floyd's own season-end-
ing ankle injury in early November.
Essentially, Woolfolk's injury sets off a chain
reaction that leads to three true freshman cor-
ners being forced to play this year. All three
would have been prime redshirt candidates,
particularly Courtney Avery - who starts for

the first time against Illinois on Nov. 6. Avery
spent 2009 playing quarterback in high school.
Twelve months later, he's a starting cornerback
in a Big Ten game.
"This is probably unprecedented, to play
(this many freshmen)," Rodriguez says. "It was
a perfect storm of injuries and misfortune that
got us here."
A perfect storm that leads to many imperfect
performances.

Troy and Stonum (@CornellStone22) tweet
at each othera lot. It's just another way for Troy
to stay connected to his friends and teammates.
But as the season progresses, his tweets
become less about this season and more about
the next. And so does the discussion.
Stonum can't wait to get his practice oppo-
nent back. He says he's missed going against
him one-on-one and the trash-talking that
comes with it. And even sometimes, the bizarre
stories that follow, like the time Troy sneezed
while Stonum was going up for the ball. The
receiver lost focus, laughed and received a ver-
bal lashing from the coaches.
Troy can't wait to get back to his island,
either. Butch says he talks about next season all
the time.
"He's a college kid who tries to play it cool,
but he's so fired up and anxious for next year,"
Butch says. "He thinks he's learned so much
about the mental aspect of the game, having
been forced to watch it combined with the
physical aspect that he thinks he'll be so far
advanced next year."
The games that Troy watches each Saturday?
Well, the freshmen play in them. And while the
young players don't always play exceptionally
well, they gain experience they can't get on the
practice field.
Troy thinks another summer of workouts
and fall camp will help him get back into play-
ing shape, and they'll help younger players get
tougher, which is something he thinks needs to
improve throughout the defense.
"The secondary has the potential to be the
strength of the defense next year," Van Ber-
gen says. "I really think that the criticism
they've been taking this year, they're going
to have motivation to get better. The players
they get back in J.T. and Troy, the experience
that they'll have with the young guys - I think
they'll be really strong."
Sept. 3, 2011 will mark the first day of Troy's
"senior' season as a Wolverine, one that will
begin 364 days later than it should have. He'll
be taking graduate-level classes.
This wasn't how his career was supposed to
go. But the difference is the one thought driv-
ing him, motivating him throughout this fall -
that while things may never turn out how he
expected them to, they might turn out better.
"(Doctors) said the surgery and everything
went great, and he should be back 100 per-
cent," Rodriguez says. "Sometimes when you
lose something, it makes you want it that much
more. I think he'll come back even hungrier
next year."

Breakdown: Wolverines could struggle
to stop Wisconsin's classic power o ffense

By RYAN KARTJE
DailySportsEditor
It's been two weeks and two bail-
out efforts from Michigan's defense
- a far cry from the Wolverines' first
eight weeks of the season. The two
straight wins have given Michigan
(3-3 Big Ten, 7-3 overall) an awful
lot of momentum, especially on the
defensive side of the ball.
But Wisconsin (5-1, 9-1) comes
into the Big House having just put
up 83 points on Indiana, and the
Badger offense, one predicated on
power, power and more power, could
pose quite a problem for Michigan's
defense as it tries to take its win
streak to three.
MICHIGAN RUN OFFENSE VS.
WISCONSIN RUN DEFENSE
Though the Michigan passing
attack struggled against Purdue, the
running game came into its own a
bit. Sophomore running back Vincent
Smith had one of his most productive
performances of the season, finishing
one yard short of the century mark.
And the Wolverines should real-
ize sooner or later that they need to
make Robinson's speed an important
part of the game.
Robinson has been quiet the last
few weeks - especially against Pur-
due - as the holes he saw in the sea-
son's first half seem to be eluding
him. Everyone expected a drop-off,
and this could be it. But expect Mich-
igan coach Rich Rodriguez to lean on
Robinson at home with the Wolver-
ines far from being favorites in this
contest.
The Badgers come in at 25th in the
nation in rush defense, so they're no
slouch. The Wolverines, however,
still rank ninth in the nation in rush-
ing - that's after a bad week against
the Boilermakers. So expecta bounce
back big time, as Michigan makes
sure that the running game is estab-
lished as early as the first drive.

MICHIGAN PASS OFFENSE VS. .
WISCONSIN PASS DEFENSE
Last week's matchup at Purdue
was without a doubt Denard Robin-
son's worst performance of the sea-
son, one that he surely would like to
forget. He was benched for fellow
sophomore Tate Forcier, who also
proved to be quite ineffective.
The Wolverines had never strug-
gled that much through the air, and
there's little reason to expect any
kind of pattern coming from last
week's effort. Terrible weather, more

than anything, should be blamed for
Michigan's inefficiencies in the pass-
ing game.
Wisconsin's pass defense is pretty
good, but nothing Michigan can't
overcome with a few clever play calls.
Michigan State's Kirk Cousins picked
the Badgers apart in Wisconsin's
only loss of the season, and if Michi-
gan has any chance of upsetting the
Badgers, it will start with Robinson's
arm.
Robinson should bounce back, but
it may be too close to call, consider-
ing his recent turnover problem

WISCONSIN RUN OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN RUN DEFENSE
Aside from Purdue quarterback
Rob Henry's 20-yard scampers, the
Wolverines did a pretty good job at
stopping the Boilermaker run game
last week.
Problem is, Wisconsin's run
offense is more like Purdue on all
kinds of steroids.
The Badgers' running backs are
some of the best in the country, led
by junior ballcarrier John Clay, who
may be the hardest back to take down
in the NCAA. Lucky for Michigan,
Clay might be out this week. If he
does see the field, he'll be playing at
around 75 percent.
Now, you might think that would
be a positive sign for the Wolver-
ines, but Wisconsin's No. 2 and No.
3 backs are both nothing to shrug
about. James White, a speedy fresh-
man who averages almost seven
yards per carry, could create prob-
lems. And sophomore Montee Ball,
who came onto the scene in Wis-
consin's 83-point scoring attack last
week, should provide the best of both
worlds with a combo of speed and
strength.
All in all, it's not looking good for
Michigan.

WISCONSIN PASS OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN PASS DEFENSE
If Michigan's pass defense wasn't in
the cellar of the NCAA, this category
could have been where the Wolverines
took advantage of their counterpart's
weakness.
The Badgers are not very good
through the air, and quarterback
Scott Tolzein hasn't done anything
that impressive, aside from managing
games, week after week. Tolzein does
have some solid skill players around
him, as wideout Nick Toon is one of
the best in the Big Ten.
Oh yeah, and his offensive line is

composed of mammoth players who
create a huge wall around the pocket.
Michigan's pass defense will depend
on how much pressure the Wolverines
are able to put on Tolzein. If they can't
get any pressure, there isn't much
hope of the inexperienced secondary
stopping Tolzein, even if he's doing his
best Trent Dilfer impression.
EDGE: WISCONSIN
SPECIAL TEAMS
Another week, another disap-
pointing effort by Seth Broekhuizen.
This week, Rodriguez said he'd open
up the conversation, with Brendan
Gibbons getting a few looks in the
kicking game. But asit has been with
Michigan's kicking game, your guess
is as good as mine who takes the field.
The Wolverines also haven't had
much in terms of a return game, so
special teams should again be an
ignore-it-till-it-hurts category.
Philip Welch, Wisconsin's kick-
er, hasn't been great this season,
either. But it's hard to get worse than
Broekhuizen. The Badgers take this
category.
EDGE: WISCONSIN
INTANGIBLES
The Wolverines definitely have
some momentum. After losing three
in a row, Michigan has bounced back
to win two straight and would love
nothing more than to take a three-

game win streak into Columbus next
weekend.
The Badgers have only lost one
game this season and have an outside
chance of winning the Big Ten.
Of those two circumstances, Wis-
consin should have the advantage as it
knows one loss means no Big Ten title.
Michigan would just like to improve
its bowl standing as much as possible.

There's a pretty distinct advantage
on the Badgers' side in this game, and
they're nothing like Michigan's last
two opponents -- Purdue and Illinois.
This might be a rude awakening for a
defense that was starting to get confi-
dence the week before The Game.
EDGE: WISCONSIN
FINAL SCORE:
WISCONSIN 42, MICHIGAN 24
