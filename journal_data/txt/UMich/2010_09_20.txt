here were no smiles on the
sideline late in the fourth
quarter. After all, the
Michigan players were witnessing
a train wreck right before their
eyes.
All sophomore quarterback
Denard Robinson could do was
put his hands on his hips and
shake his head
as he watched
Massachusetts
score its 37th
point and pick
up its 439th ,
yard with less
than two min-
utes. TIM
Michigan ROHAN
did win the __HA __
game, but it
didn't feel like
a win - more like an accident that
everyone walked away from alive,
but scarred and perhaps with a
new perspective.
The Wolverines put up 525
total yards of offense on the day -
that's expected. Beating a Football
Championship Subdivision school
by just five points - that's not.
Robinson's Heisman-hyped
start to the season clouded fans'
perception of this Michigan team.
But the Minutemen cut through

the fog and revealed Michigan's
true identity: a potentially historic
offense that has to make up for the
defense's mistakes.
The fog was gone right from
the start as a Massachusetts team
built a 17-7 lead over Michigan
which it held it until late in the
second quarter. The visitors led
the game for more than 20 min-
utes in the first half. Remember,
this team plays StonyBrook next
week.
After the Minutemen scored
their last touchdown and kicked
an onside kick out of bounds,
Rohinson walked hack onto the
field and hailed out the defense
handing the ball off to junior run-
ning back Mike Shaw three times
for one final first down to end the
game.
Earlier on, it was junior wide
receiver Darryl Stonum and
Robinson who connected for two
touchdowns in 45 seconds to take
a 21-17 lead at the half. And Shaw
had a career day runningthe ball,
scoring three touchdowns.
They did their job.
The outcome of Saturday's
game could have been like Toledo.
It could have been another Appa-
lachian State episode. Thanks

Campus landmark
area costs city
hundreds, at times
thousands, to clean
By ROBIN VEECK
Daily StaffReporter
Painting "The Rock" on the
corner of Hill Street and Washt-
enaw Avenue is a beloved campus
tradition for many students and
alumni. However, the antics asso-

ciated with the University land-
mark are less popular among Ann
Arbor city officials and residents
of the neighborhoods surround-
ing George Washington Park,
home of The Rock.
While the city never attempts
to remove paint from The Rock
itself, paint intended to decorate
the boulder frequently ends up
on city property, including side-
walks, trash cans and signs. In
previous years, the city has spent
hundreds, and at times thousands,
of dollars to clean the area that
will likely never remain pristine.

Ann Arbor park maintenance
employees are responsible for
periodically cleaning the area and
responding to complaints from
residents.
In a January 2009 e-mail to
Ann Arbor City Council members,
Karla Henderson, former Ann
Arbor field operations supervisor,
reported that the city spent more
than $2,500 in 2007 on remov-
ing graffiti at George Washington
Park, according to a2docs.org - a
website, which posts documents
regarding the city of Ann Arbor
obtained by residents and organi-

zations.
"We spent $2,662 for 2 visits
(painting) and 24 visits to check
to make sure that there was no
vandalism," Henderson wrote in
the e-mail.
But, Matt Warba, the city's cur-
rent field operations supervisor,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
the 2007 cleaning expenses were
larger than what the city usually
spends to clean up the area.
"The city expended less than
$100 in time and material last cal-
endar year addressing graffiti at

EN MEMO RIAM PERFORMING FOR PEACE
At Michigan Stadium, fans
honor UMass band director :

George N. Parks
passed away en
route to Ann Arbor
By A. BRAD SCHWARTZ
Daily StaffReporter
A somber mood swept through
Michigan Stadium on Saturday
as the loud speakers called atten-
tion to the recent death of Univer-
sity of Massachusetts Amherst
marching band director George
N. Parks. The halftime show at
the game was in honor of Parks'

memory.
Parks, the director of the
UMass's Minuteman Marching
Band for 33 years, passed away
Thursday night while with the
UMass band in Cuyahoga Falls,
Ohio, the Boston Globe reported.
He was 57 years old.
Massachusetts Chancel-
lor Robert C. Holub sent a mass
e-mail to the UMass community
Friday morning expressing his
grief, saying that Parks "repre-
sented thebest of UMass."
"George's devotion to excel-
lence, his creativity and his pas-
sion for teaching inspired us all

and shaped the lives of thousands
of students during the three
decades that he directed
The Power and Class of New
England," Holub wrote in the
statement.
UMass Student Band Manager
Caity Bogdan has spent five years
playing the mellophone in the
Minuteman Marching Band. In
an interview, Bogdan described
Parks as "a father to the family" -
referring to the band - and some-
one who has taught her how to be
a student leader.
"He's just been a fantastic

To pedestrians walking down
Main Street on Friday, the
streetscape might have looked a
bit odd.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Government may
* look abroad for GM
investors
Investment bankers handling
the upcoming General Motors Co.
stock sale are expected to court
foreign investors as well as those
in North America, according to a
U.S. Treasury Department state-
ment.
GM and the Treasury Depart-
ment would not comment yester-
day on reports that the automaker
is in talks with its current part-
ner in China, SAIC, about buying
a stake in the Detroit company.
SAIC is owned by the Chinese gov-
ernment.
" The Treasury Department, in a
statement issued late Friday, said
investors in GM would be sought
across "multiple geographies,"
with a focus on North America.
The U.S. Treasury loaned GM
about $50 billion to help it through
bankruptcy protection last year.
GM has repaid $6.7 billion. The
rest of the bailout money was con-
verted to a 61 percent government
stake in the company.
The government hopes to get
the remaining $43 billion back
with stock sales that could start in
mid-November.
WASHINGTON
Obama says gov.
remains committed
to Gulf relief efforts
President Barack Obama is call-
ing the successful "kill" for the
blown-out well in the Gulf of Mex-
ico a milestone in his administra-
tion's response to the disaster that
leaked hundreds of millions of gal-
lons of oil.
The federal government's point
man on the response, retired Coast
Guard Adm. Thad Allen, said yes-
terday that tests show BP's well "is
effectively dead" and poses no fur-
ther threat.
Obama said in a statement that
his administration remains com-
mitted to doing everything possible
to ensure that the Gulf Coast recov-
ers fully from the disaster.
Obama pledged that his adminis-
tration will continue to work close-
ly with people who live in the Gulf
region as they rebuild their liveli-
hoods and restore the environment.
KABUL, Afghanistan
Concerns over
possible fraud at
Afghan polls
The main Afghan election
observer group said it had serious
concerns about the legitimacy of
this weekend's parliamentary vote
because of reported fraud, even
as President Hamid Karzai com-
mended the balloting as a solid
success.
The conflicting statements
underscored the difficulty of
determining the credibility of the
vote also hit by militant attacks
that hurt the turnout. Afghan

officials started gathering and
tallying results yesterday in a
process that could last weeks if
not months.
The country's international
backers praised those who voted
Saturday despite bomb and rock-
et attacks and voiced hoped for a
democratic result. A repeat of the
pervasive fraud that tainted a pres-
idential election a year ago would
only erode further the standing of
Karzai administration - both at
home and abroad - as it struggles
against a Taliban insurgency.
CIUDAD IUAREZ, Mexico
Mexico border
newspaper seeks
truce with cartels
The largest newspaper in Ciu-
dad Juarez asked the border city's
warring drug cartels yesterday for
a truce after the killing last week
of its second journalist in less than
two years.
In a front-page editorial, El Dia-
rio de Juarez asked the cartels what
they want from the newspaper so it
can continue its work without fur-
ther death, injury or intimidation of
its staff.
"Leaders of the different orga-
nizations that are fighting for con-
trol of Ciudad Juarez: The loss of
two reporters from this publishing
house in less than two years rep-
resents an irreparable breakdown
for all of us who work here, and, in
particular, for their families," the
editorial said.

U.S. woman
freed from
Iran: I'm
not a spy

Members of a breakaway religious sect prepare to leave after they were located yesterday by Los Angeles County Sheriff
officers at Jackie Robinson Park in Littlerock, Calif. The group was found praying at the park.
After members go missing,
authorities hold cult leader

Members of Calif.
religious sect later
found in park
PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) - The
leader of a breakaway -religious
sect was hospitalized yesterday
for a mental evaluation, after
members of her group went miss-
ing and left behind evidence that
they were awaiting the rapture or
some catastrophic event.
Reyna Marisol Chicas was
placed under a 72-hour manda-
tory hold after it was determined
she was not able to care for her-
self or others, said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Deputy Thomas
Kim.
Chicas gave investigators a
false name and was rambling dur-
ing questioning, Kim said. She
told deputies she had no children,
even though her two kids were
with her.
Ending a frantic search, depu-
ties found Chicas and 12 others
just before noon at Jackie Rob-
inson Park near Palmdale after
getting a tip from a local resident,
said sheriff's spokesman Steve
Whitmore. He said all members
are safe.
Officers had been searching a
wide swath of Southern Califor-

nia since Saturday after family
members found letters saying the
group was awaiting an apoca-
lyptic event and would soon see
Jesus and their dead relatives in
heaven.
The group of El Salvadoran
immigrants described as "cult-
like" by sheriff's officials, was led
by Chicas, a 32-year-old woman
from Palmdale in northeast Los
Angeles county, sheriff's Captain
Mike Parker said.
Members left behind cell
phones, identifications, deeds to
property, and letters indicating
they were awaiting the Rapture.
The items came from a purse
that a member of the group had
left with her husband Saturday
and asked him to pray over. He
eventually looked inside and he
and another member's husband
called authorities, authorities
said.
"These letters read like a will
and testament. They read like
goodbye letters," said Whitmore.
"Coupled with the two husbands
that come in and tell us 'Our wives
are missing, we believe they are
under the spell of this lady,"' dep-
uties had no choice but to treat the
matter seriously, he said.
Whitmore said he didn't know
if the members had done anything
like this before.

Sheriff's officials said there
was no criminal investigation
planned.
The men told investigators
they believe group members had
been "brainwashed" by Chicas,
and one expressed worries that
they might harm themselves,
Parker said. One of the children
is 3, and the others range from12
to 17.
When deputies arrived at the
park they found the children play-
ing on swings and the adults on a
blanket praying out loud in Span-
ish.
The adults expressed shock at
the notion that they might harm
themselves, Parker said.
A sheriff's deputy had spoken
to members of the group at 3 a.m.
Saturday while they were praying
in their parked vehicles outside
of a Palmdale high school, Parker
said.
When the deputy made con-
tact, adults in the group told
him they were praying against
violence in schools and against
sexual immorality, specifically
premarital sex.
The 13 adults and children
were in three vehicles outside
Pete Knight High School, Parker
said. The deputy reported every-
one appeared safe and he went on
his way.

Woman calls arrest
and detention 'a huge
misunderstanding'
NEW YORK (AP) --An Ameri-
can woman who was held in Iran
for more than 13 months and
accused of espionage said yes-
terday she and two men detained
with her never spied or commit-
ted any crime, calling their arrest
"a huge misunderstanding."
Discussing her experience at
the most length since her release
Tuesday, Sarah Shourd under-
scored her gratitude at being
released but said she felt only
"one-third free" because her fian-
ce, Shane Bauer, and their friend
Josh Fattal remain in Tehran's
notorious Evin Prison.
"This is not the time to cel-
ebrate," Shourd, 32, said at a New
York news conference. "The only
thing that enabled me to cross the
gulf from prison to freedom alone
was the knowledge that Shane
and Josh wanted with all their
hearts for my suffering to end."
Meanwhile, Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrived
in New York to attend the U.N.
General Assembly. He later met
with U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon to discuss devel-
opments in Iraq, Afghanistan
and the Middle East as well as
efforts to resolve the dispute over
Iran's nuclear program, the U.N.
spokesperson's office said.
Ahmadinejad told The Associ-
ated Press, "We're very glad that
that lady was released. (Due) to
the humanitarian perspective the
Islamic Republic chose to adopt
on the subject, she was released
on bail. And we hope that the
other two will soon be able to
prove and provide evidence to
the court that they had no ill
intention in crossing the border,
so that their release can also be
secured."
Tying the case to Iran's asser-
tion that some of its citizens are
being held unjustly in the Unit-
ed States, he said, "It certainly
does not give us joy when we see
people in prison, wherever in the
world that may be, and even when
we think of prisoners here."
Composed but occasionally
pausing when her voice wavered
with emotion, Shourd thanked
Iranians and Ahmadinejad in a
carefully scripted return that
spoke to the continuing delicacy
of her situation. She didn't take
questions or discuss the condi-
tions in which she'd been held,
walking away from the podium at
a Manhattan hotel hand-in-hand
with her mother, Nora, before

Fattal's and Bauer's mothers
answered reporters' queries.
Iran has issued espionage-
related indictments against her,
Bauer and Fattal; the indictments
could bring trials for the two men
and proceedings in absentia for
Shourd.
But Shourd stressed their inno-
cence in a case that has added to
the roster of tensions between
the U.S. and Iran.
The three were detained in
July 2009 after Iranian officials
said they intentionally crossed
the country's border from Iraq.
Echoing accounts their fami-
lies have given in their absence,
Shourd said Sunday that the
three had been hiking in a popu-
lar tourist area - near a waterfall
in Iraq's Kurdistan region - and
had no idea the border was near-
by.
"If we were indeed near the
Iraq-Iran border, that border was
entirely unmarked and indistin-
guishable," she said.
"Shane and Josh do not
deserve to be in prison one day
longer than I was," she said. "We
committed no crime and we are
not spies. We in no way intended
any harm to the Iranian govern-
ment or its people and believe a
huge misunderstanding led to our
detention and prolonged impris-
onment."
Shourd's mother has said she
had health problems including
a breast lump and precancerous
cervical cells. Shourd said Sun-
day that doctors in Oman, where
she went immediately after her
release, had determined she was
physically well.
Officials in Oman - an ally of
both Iran and the United States
- mediated a $500,000 bail for
Shourd that satisfied Iranian
authorities and apparently did
not violate U.S. economic sanc-
tions against Iran. The source
of the bail payment has not been
disclosed.
After 410 days in Iranian cus-
tody, "I walked out of prison with
my spirit bruised but unbroken,"
she said.
Shourd left Oman on Saturday
for Dubai, United Arab Emirates,
and took a commercial flight from
there to Dulles International
Airport, near Washington, the
Americans' families said.
Shourd and Bauer had been liv-
ing together in Damascus, Syria,
where Bauer was working as a
freelance journalist and Shourd
as an English teacher. Fattal, an
environmental activist and a fel-
low graduate of the University of
California at Berkeley, came to
visit them last July, and the three
went hiking.

Chinese government halts
high-level talks with Japan

Fishing boat
captain's extended
detention led to
countries' dispute
BEIJING (AP) - China broke
off high-level government con-
tacts with Japan over the extend-
ed detention of a fishing boat
captain arrested near disputed
islands. The rare move pushed
already tense relations to a new
low, and showed China's will-
ingness to play hardball with its
Asian rival on issues of territorial
integrity.
The move late yesterday came
a day after anti-Japanese protests
were held across China on the
anniversary of the start of a Japa-
neseinvasion of Chinain 1931 that
has historically cast a shadow
over ties between the world's sec-
ond- and third-largesteconomies.
The latest spat between Tokyo
and Beijing was sparked when
the Chinese vessel collided with
two Japanese coast guard ships
on Sept. 7 near islands in the
East China Sea claimed by both
countries. The 14 Chinese crew
were released last week, but the
captain's detention for further
questioning - pending a decision
about whether to press charges
- has inflamed ever-present anti-
Japanese sentiment in China.
China's Foreign Ministry said
that Japan's refusal to release the
boat captain had caused "severe
damage" to relations.
A ministry statement said
Beijing had suspended ministe-
rial and provincial-level contacts,
halted talks on aviation issues
and postponed a meeting to dis-
cuss coal.
"If Japan acts willfully, mak-
ing mistake after mistake, China
will take strong countermea-
sures, and all the consequences
will be borne by the Japanese

side," Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said in a
statement.
Takeshi Matsunaga, a spokes-
man for Japan's Foreign Ministry,
said the reported measures were
unilateral.
"We ask China to respond
calmly so as not to escalate the
problem further," he said.
The move raises questions
aboutcooperation between China
and Japan at international forums
such as this week's summit in
New York on United Nations
goals to fight poverty, which Chi-
nese Premier Wen Jiabao and
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto
Kan are attending.
It also throws into doubt
whether China's President Hu
Jintao will attend the annual
summit of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum leaders to
be held in Yokohama, Japan, in

November. Leaders of the two
countries were also due to attend
a G-20 summit in Seoul the same
month.
This is the lowest bilateral
relations have fallen to since the
2001-2006 term of ftrmer Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
whose repeated visits to a war
shrine in Japan during his tenure
angered China.
The two countries halted
ministerial-level defense talks
for three years from 2003. But
even in those tense times, Japan's
foreign minister visited China in
2004 and met Wen.
China's decision to cut high-
level contacts appears to reflect a
worry about losing face in front of
the Chinese public, which might
trigger a nationalistic backlash
against the government if it
appears weak or unable to protect
the country's sovereignty.

Bingvs. Detroi t
Mayor needs to outline redevelopment plans
There was a time when Detroit was Michigan's industrial
powerhouse. The home of the automotive industry that
sustained the state for decades, Detroit seemed to be invin-
cible. That is no longer the case. The city needs a new direction -
and Mayor Dave Bing has a plan to bring Detroit hope. Recently,
Bing's plan to redevelop Detroit, The Detroit Works Program, has
spurred criticism from many residents. Despite the opposition,
this initiative would be beneficial for the city. Though their con-
cerns are legitimate, residents need to realize the plan's potential
to reinvent the city. At the same time, Bing owes it to his city to
create a concrete and practical plan for urban redevelopment.

A need for unionization

n last Tuesday's Daily, Rachel Van
Gilder, editorial page editor and
fellow columnist, raised my blood
pressure when she
argued that unions
are unnecessary
and that Michigan
should become a
right-to-work state'
(An unholy union
policy, 09/14/2010).
I'll be blunt:
She's wrong. Not
only does she base PATRICK
her arguments on
faulty logic, but O'MAHEN
she fails to support
many of her conten-
tions with evidence.
Start with her naive assertion that
unions aren't necessary because we
now have state and federal laws that
set minimum wages and workplace
safety standards that protect workers.
One of the major reasons why we have
all those laws and standards is because
unions have lobbied hard for them
against determined employer opposi-
tion. And union pressure helps federal
inspectors do their jobs by informing
workers of their rights and giving them
legal backing if they get fired for trying
to exercise them.
Then Van Gilder claims - without a
shred of evidence - that we don't need
unions because steelworkers don't
work 14-hour days for no pay in unsafe
conditions any more. That's true in
some job classes, but farm workers,
coal miners and others still labor in
very dangerous conditions.
And plenty of more mundane
employers abuse their workers. Local-
ly, the Michigan Restaurant Opportu-
nities Center has detailed numerous
problems in local eateries, includ-
ing violation of minimum wage laws,
denial of overtime pay and health and
safety violations.
Finally Van Gilder failed to under-
stand that basic economics demon-
strates that instead of giving workers
more flexibility, right-to-work laws

isolate worker's and reduce their bar-
gaining power.
Most workers are what economists
would call price-takers - that is, they
have very little negotiating power.
The only people with individual
leverage in negotiations tend to be at
the top of the pyramid - CEOs and
highly skilled professionals. A Uni-
versity example is newly minted Pro-
vost Philip Hanlon, who wrangled a
28-percent raise despite state aid cuts
and a massive recession. As a GSI, I
don't have that sort of power, nor do
lecturers, custodians, bus drivers,
restaurant servers or wait staff.
The analogy to alabor-management
relationship is that of a consumer and
a merchant. When I go to the grocery
store, I don't haggle with the produce
manager over the price of an orange. I
either buyit at$1.99 apound or I don't.
If we don't like our job, we can always
try toget another one - the equivalent
of going to another store. But search-
ing for a job costs time and money, like
searching for cheaper oranges wastes
an afternoon.
Notice how union membership
does not affect the ability to search for
another job, undercutting Van Gilder's
contention that unionization hurts
worker's individual ability to negoti-
ate. In fact, many union contracts help
workers acquire more skills and better
position themselves in the job market
by setting up free training courses or
allowing for other development. An
example is the Lecturers' Employee
Organization contract, which man-
dates that the University set aside
grants to help lecturers implement
teaching innovations.
Of course, I think what Van Gilder
specifically objects to is being forced
to join a union when she is on the job,
which she calls "bizarre." But she
fails to understand the dynamics of
free-rider problems.
Right-to-work laws undermine
workers by making union benefits
apply to all workers, but don't make
workers join the union. The set-up

encourages some workers to free ride
on the organizing and dues of others
without sanction. As a result, right-
to-work greatly weakens the union's
resources that fund its ability to bar-
gain, protect workers and lobby for
worker-friendly laws. As a result all
workers lose out.
Unionization
doesn't hurt *
individual choice.
I've been pretty hard on Van Gilder
in this column, so I'll close by sympa-
thizing with her implicit contentions
that suggest unions might not always
recognize her own views. The way to
solve that problem is not to abandon
your union (an action which hurts you
and your fellow workers), but to get
involved with it. Make your union rep-
resentyou - and ifthatmeans you want
to settle for a 3-percent raise instead of
striking for a 5-percent raise, there's
nothing wrong withcthat.
I know dozens of activists (includ-
ing myself) who have gotten involved
in our union, the Graduate Employees'
Organization, because we were-upset 0
with some of the union's stances at
the bargaining table. Because we
got involved, the union is both more
pragmatic in its actions and takes into
account the needs of groups - like
parents and disabled workers, who
often fall through the cracks in tradi-
tional labor negotiations.
Van Gilder and I agree that unions
should be democratic and broadly rep-
resentative of the wishes of their mem-
bers, but before she becomes a teacher,
she needs to do some homework on the
reality of right-to-work laws.

On Sept.14, Bing held a community forum
at Detroit City Hall for citizens to discuss
redevelopment ideas for the city. Currently,
60,000 of Detroit's 387,000 lots are vacant,
according to a Sept. 15 Detroit Free Press
article. In his address, the mayor expressed
his belief that removing blighted properties
and centralizing the population closer to
downtown would create a safer, more suc-
cessful and more appealing city. Many resi-
dents aren't happy with Bing's plan - which
is still very much in the planning stages
- and voiced their views at the forum last
week. Bing has planned four more forums in
order to gather more community input.
While Bing's ambitious urban redevel-
opment plan is a large project for the frail
city to undertake, it's a good idea. The city's
economy has struggled for years. Economic
hardship has led to increased crime and an
unsustainable local budget. The city needs
a radical change to eradicate urban decay
and resurrect the economy. Demolish-
ing blighted properties would combat low
property values and open land for redevel-
opment and help balance the city's budget.
Yet, city residents' objections are valid.
Because many of these residents are liv-
ing in poverty, many simply don't have

the financial resources to move toward
the center of the city. And Bing hasn't
explained how he would make moving
realistic. Confusion about how the plan
would be implemented has led many to
believe that they are simply being forced
from their homes. In a Free Press article,
Detroit resident Denise Greer said, "Bing
just wants to take us out ... they are going
to take away our city."
For the plan to garner public support
and move forward, Bing needs to create a
plan that will make it economically viable
for low-income households to relocate to
more dense parts of the city. As mayor,
Bing has a responsibility to his citizens to
make their lives better. This implicit con-
tract with the people of Detroit means he
owes them a concrete description of how
his urban redevelopment plan will work -
and he needs to ensure that residents will
have a voice.
The plan to eliminate blight and create
new options appears to be a viable option
for the future of Detroit. Residents should
work with Bing in order to make the proj-
ect a success. But the burden is on Bing to
give residents a good reason to get on board
with the plan.

Renewed xenophobia

The Daily opinion blog wants you to weigh in. Will Butler wonders if Tea Party
candidates can win November elections - and if Dems realize that they're a threat.
DAVID HALPERIN I
Dear Attorney General

Dear Mr. Cox,
As a professor at the University of Michigan,
I am surprised that you condone the violent
harassment and abuse by one of your employees,
Andrew Shirvell, toward the president of our stu-
dent body, Chris Armstrong.
Armstrong has not, so far as I know, done any-
thingto offend your employee nor has he broken
any law. It is unfathomable to me that you could
tolerate this sort of behavior by anyone who
works in your office. It seems extraordinary for
a member of the Attorney General's staff to carry

out a lengthy and prolonged campaign of public
harassment against a private citizen on account
of that citizen's private life. Are we now to imag-
ine a scenario in which a student at the Univer-
sity of Michigan is obliged to go to court to seek a
restraining order against a member of the Attor-
ney General's staff?
I am frankly perplexed, and I would be
grateful for an explanation.
Yours,
Dr. David M. Halperin
LSA professor

it's a common perception that
democracy protects and cel-
ebrates fundamental human
rights, freedoms
and diversity. But
over the past few
weeks, multiple
incidents have chal-
lenged these fun- "
damental notions.
Nine years after
the events of Sept.
11, 2001, it seems
Muslims resid- TOMMASO
log in democracies
across the world PAVONE
are facing renewed
xenophobia. Let me
shed light on a few
incidents that have taken place from
France to the United Kingdom to New
York City that should be of concern to
all of us.
On Sept. 14, the French Senate
voted 246 to 1 to pass legislation that
bans all forms of dress covering the
face - the burqa being the primary
target. Now, any woman found wear-
ing a burqa in public will face a choice
between a fine of 150 euros - $195 -
and a citizenship course. If it's deter-
mined that the woman was forced to
wear the veil, then the perpetrator
can be fined up to 30,000 euros and
face prison time. French President
Nicolas Sarkozy, who lobbied for
the legislation, and the 82 percent
of french citizens surveyed in a Pew
Global Attitudes Project poll who
support the ban seem to have finally
gotten their wish.
Simultaneouslyin Britain, an Irani-
an mother of two, Farah Ghaemi, was
in the process of packing her bags. In
August, the UK Border Agency pro-
vided Ghaemi with an ultimatum:
return to Iran or face deportation. She
refused to leave voluntarily because

Iranian police had recently raided
her house and found a copy of Salman
Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," and
now she faced the possibility of death
by stoning for what an Iranian arrest
warrant termed, "propagating against
the sacred system of the Islamic
Republic of Iran." But the British con-
servative government, elected on a
distinctly anti-immigration platform,
had no intention of appearing soft on
immigration. Thankfully, on the very
day that Ghaemi's deportation was to
take place, activists won an injunc-
tion from a High Court judge blocking
her removal. So Ghaemi can breathe a
sigh of relief-- for now.
In New York City, a Muslim com-
munity center set to be built approxi-
mately two blocks from the ground
zero site has become the focal point of
a national controversy. Referred to as
the "World Trade Center mosque" by
political pundits and conservative poli-
ticians, many have called the project a
provocation. The fact that the center
was approved by the city's Landmarks
Preservation Commission on Aug.
3 and that both the neighborhood's
community board and Mayor Michael
Bloomberg support it didn't seem to
matter. In fact, the community board
received so many angry calls - many
from non-New York City residents -
that it was forced to request riot police
for its next meeting.
It's well-known that minorities
often feel the wrath of the majority
during times of challenge. Perhaps it's
the stresses of a weak global economy
combined with the remnants of the
Bush era's "us versus them" mental-
ity that has rendered xenophobic sen-
timents so enticing. But as students at
the University who pride ourselves as
being progressive, we have a duty to
critically engage these caustic issues.
What kind of precedent is set by a

national law targeting a specific reli-
gious dress? What does it say about
democracy when a government tries
to deport an individual to a repres-
sive regime in large part because of
domestic politics? And how do we
reconcile our devotion to freedom
and the Constitution with the public
outcry in favor of dictating where a
house of worship is to be built?
Challenging
our notion of
democracy.
I don't have clear, simple answers
to these questions. However, as an
immigrant first and a student of pub-
lic policy and political science second,
I do find these events extremely con-
cerning for the state of democracy.
And if we're to transform these chal-
lenges into opportunities to improve
society, we must fundamentally chal-
lenge our notions of democracy, free-
dom, human rights and equality and
ask ourselves if our actions are in
compliance with our ideals.
This process of self-questioning
should be intrinsic to our develop-
ment as democratic citizens. As
students, we shouldn't just absorb
knowledge like sponges - we should
strive to acquire the critical thinking
necessary to help make the world a
better place for everyone. And that
includes people who challenge us to
reconsider what we think democracy
is all about.

in the American auto industry's
long-term ability to compete in the
global market.
"I am not concerned with Ford
competing with anybody in the
world," Mulally said.
Mulally talked about how global-
ization and economic policy relates
to the auto industry, including how
he disagrees with the North Ameri-
can Free Trade Agreement, which
he believes is hurting the economy.
NAFTA was an agreement estab-
lished in 1994, which aims to elimi-
nate trade barriers between the
United States, Canada and Mexico.
Critics argue that the treaty leads to
job losses inthe U.S.
"Thisis not afreetradeagreement
that makes sense," Mulally said.
Mulally has been the CEO of Ford
Motor Co. since2006. He previously
was the executive vice president of
The Boeing Company and president
and CEO of Boeing Commercial Air-
planes.
About 600 people came to see
Mulally speak at Stamps Audito-
rium, which seats 450 people. After
it overflowed, the unseated audience
members were directed to two class-
rooms in the nearby Chrysler Center,
where a live screening of Mulally's

and wondering why no one else
in Ann Arbor had participated in
the past.
"After complaining that it
wasn't happening for so many
years, I was like, 'Guess I've got
to do it myself,"' Panozzo said.
Panozzo explained that the
park in front of Workantile
Exchange was loosely organized,
with a call to Ann Arbor gar-
dening store Pot & Box for a few
loaned plants, as well as an invi-
tation to young musicians at Ann
Arbor's Community High School
who played music for part of the
day.
"It's a completely open source
project, which means every group
adapts it a different way and does
different things with it," Panozzo
said.

speech was shown.
Students enrolled in Engineering
407: Entrepreneurship Hour made
up a large part of the audience. The
College of Engineering asked Mulal-
ly to speak for the approximately 350
students enrolled in the class, who
were required to attend Mulally's
lecture.
Engineering junior Laura Willm-
ing, a peer advisor for the college
who helped run the event, said
Panozzo described his goal as
merely to spark a conversation
about public-space use.
"My intention is to just open
the dialogue ... (for people to) just
stop and be like, 'What are these
people doing here? Why are there
trees and plants in a parking
spot?"' Panozzo said.
City Council member Sandi
Smith (D-Ward 1), who sits on the
board for the Downtown Devel-
opment Authority, said she sup-
ports (PARK)ing day and the idea
behind it.
"Personally I absolutely love
it," Smith said. "There is an ele-
ment, I think, of creativity and
playfulness in it. I think it makes
people stop and pause and think
about things a little bit. You're not
used to seeing a potted palm and a
couch in a parking space on Main
Street, so it just makes one recon-
sider their paradigms."
While this year's event was
relatively small in scale - Ann

she organized a previous lecture
where three Traverse City entre-
preneurs spoke. Later this semes-
ter, organizers intend to invite
Niklas Zennstrtm and Janus Friis,
the founders of Skype, who will
potentially Skype with the audience,

Anup Jadhav, an Engineering
freshman who is enrolled in Engi-
neering 407, said Mulally's talk fit
well with the theme of the class.
Arbor had two metered spaces -
other cities reserved hundreds of
metered parking spots. Panozzo
admitted that little promotion
was done for the event.
"I hope that this year is almost
just like a launching pad for peo-
ple to know the event exists for
future years," Panozzo said.
As midday drew close, Pan-
ozzo described the course of the
day as having surpassed expecta-
tions, with a peak of 25 visitors
at one point filling every chair.
However, Panozzo said there are
many elements to consider before
planning next year's event, like
getting other groups and organi-
zations involved and helping the
event to grow citywide.
Joel Batterman, a graduate stu-
dent in the University's Urban and
Regional Planning program and
a participant in the event, said it
was good to see people benefit-
ing from a space that is typically
used for an explicit purpose, but

"I understand more about entre-
preneurship now," Jadhavsaid. "Itis
nice to hear from leaders around the
world in engineering."
Aida Mandic, an LSA junior who is
also enrolled in Engineering 407, said
she found the lecture "inspiring."
"(Mulally) said 'necessity is the
mother of innovation,' and I really
believe that," Mandic said. "Wher-
ever you need something, is where
you will find genius."
he too saw greater potential for
next year.
"I'm a student, and you know,
I think it would be wonderful to
have more places next year clos-
er to campus," Batterman said.
"Maybe I'll take the wheel on
that."
Rachel Pastiva, manager of
Main Street's Crazy Wisdom
Bookstore and Tea Room, said she
was pleasantly surprised to walk
into her store and see plants set
up out front. She added that she
wished she had known about the
event beforehand.
"It would be helpful if we
were more aware of it because
we would love to be able to help
them promote the event because
I think we were kind of honored
that it was taking place in front of
Crazy Wisdom," Pastiva said.
She added that she would be
"very happy" if (PARK)ing Day
took place outside her store again
next year.

Dantonio's heart attack sheds light on
unhealthy lifestyle of a college coach

MSU coach suffered
a heart attack on
Saturday night
after win over ND
NEW YORK (AP) - Imagine if
every decision you made at work
was scrutinized by millions of peo-
ple and your livelihood was essen-
tially tied to the performance of a
bunch of college students.
That's the life of big-time college
football head coaches such as Mich-
igan State's Mark Dantonio, who
had a heart attack after his team's
thrilling 34-31victory against Notre
Dame on Saturday night.
It's a 24/7 job that once a week
requires a major presentation.
Except for a coach, the conference
room is a stadium packed with.
crazy fans and television cameras.
While it'd be a stretch to say
coaching is hazardous to one's
health, the fact is the lifestyle is not
conducive to staying fit. Late nights
in the film room, meals grabbed
here and there, hours away from
family and precious little down
time - all of it contributes to stress.

teacher to all of us and a friend
when we need one," she said.
In addition to the announce-
ment dedicating both marching
bands' halftime performances to
Parks' memory, the University held
a moment of silence before the Min-
uteman Marching Band's pregame
performance.
E. Royster Harper, vice president
for student affairs at the University
of Michigan, sent a mass e-mail to
students on Friday asking for their
support.
"We ask for your sensitivity and
participation in showing our collec-
tive sympathy during this difficult
time for our guests," Harper wrote.
Michigan Athletic Department
spokesman Bruce Madej offered
words of support in an interview on
Friday.
"We were shocked and saddened
by the news, and our prayers and
sympathies go out to the entire
University of Massachusetts com-
munity and especially the march-
ing band," he said.
John Pasquale, assistant direc-
tor of bands at the University, also
expressed sympathy for UMass
students and faculty.
"They have lost an invaluable
person both to the field of march-

"There is nothing healthy about
it," former Texas Tech coach Mike
Leach said Sunday.
The 54-year-old Dantonio is
expected to make a full recovery
after having surgery early Sunday
to put a stent in a blocked blood ves-
sel leading to hisheart. He's expect-
ed to remain in the hospital a few
more days, but when he returns to
the sideline is unclear.
He definitely won't be back to
work when Michigan State plays
Northern Colorado on Saturday.
And to be sure, the news of Dan-
tonio's condition caused more than a
few coaches to take notice yesterday.
"Obviously, it hits you right away,
not only for the individual and the
person Mark Dantonio, but as a
coach in the profession," Notre
Dame coach Brian Kelly said. "You
go through the emotions of the
game and obviously you think about
your own self in terms of are you
taking care of yourself, are you get-
ting the right checkups and those
kinds of things?"
Dantonio's heart attack comes
less than ayear after Florida's Urban
Meyer was hospitalized with chest
pains after the Southeastern Con-
ference championship game. Meyer
ing and pageantry arts, in addition
to just a great person," he said in
an interview on Friday. "(Parks)
was always so full of life and such
an inspiring teacher and the entire
marching band community is sad-
dened by his passing."
On Thursday night, Parks con-
ducted a performance with the
band at Cuyahoga Heights High
School before heading to Ann
Arbor - a destination Parks had
looked forward to performing at for
some time, according to Jim Lend-
vay, the father of a UMass march-
ing band trombonist.
"When we met him last year ... he
talked about coming to play Michi-
gan this year and playing in the Big
House, and that it's the mecca of
college marching bands, and that
he was going to take his band -
come hell or high water - he was
taking his band to Michigan and
we were going to make it a show,"
Lendvay said. "And he did that."
Bogdan, the student band man-
ager, agreed that playing at the Big
House was important to Parks.
"[Parks] kept saying, all the way
here, 'You're going into mecca for us.
This is going into one of the homes
of marching bands ... a place where
people appreciate marching bands
and their traditions and the way of
life it represents,"' Bogdan said.
Bogdan added that Parks has
become such an important part of

he took a leave of absence after
being diagnosed with esophageal
spams. He is taking medication to
fight the problem.
Doctors say the type of work-
related stress that can lead to medi-
cal problems is often caused by lack
of time and lack of control - two
items football coaches deal with
every day.
Leach was the coach at Texas
Tech for 10 years before being fired
after last season.
He said eating right and getting
regular exercise was almost impos-
sible for him during the football
season. It wasn't just the practices,
meetings and game planning that
consumed his day. Being the foot-
ball coach at a major university is
a lot like being the CEO of a huge
company, multimillion-dollar sal-
ary included.
"There's the stress of dealing
with the day-to-dayand the ups and
downs of 120 different people, most
of them ages18-22," said Leach, who
is working as a television analystfor
CBS College Sports this season and
hopes to be back in coaching next
year. "There is also the politics that
the Minuteman Marching Band's
traditions.
"There's no way to divorce him
from what we do now," she said.
UMass band members wore
black armbands in memory of Parks
during Saturday's game. After the
game both bands played a post-
game set as per tradition, and many
of the UMass students and parents
became visibly emotional during
the final song - a rendition of "My
Way"- the song the Minuteman
Marching Band traditionally ends
each game with.
"On Thursday night that was the
last song that we got to play with
him, soit's very emotional ... Some-
thing tells me there's going to be a
lot of crying during 'My Way' every
time we play it for the next couple
of months," Bogdan said.
Since Parks's passing, the UMass
band has received an outpouring
of support from alumni and the
UMass band community. One of the
band's conductors even flew to Ann
Arbor after hearing about Parks'
death.
"The fact that we can pull
together, even through all of this, I
think speaks a lot to the family that
(Parks) built forus here, and that is
going to go on even without him,"
Bogdan said.
Parks led the band during per-
formances at three presidential
inaugurations, in 1981, 1985 and

go into a university and some of the
bureaucracy."
Add to that media obligations
and the time it takes to act as an
ambassador for the program with
fans and alumni, and it's no surprise
Leach says he would generally sleep
4-6 hours a night.
"Then I'd throw in a 10-hour
(night)," he said. "I'm living proof
that you can cram for sleep."
The 49-year-old Leach said
after years of poor eating habits
- unhealthy foods and not eating
frequently enough - he assigned a
graduate assistant the job of mak-
ing sure the head coach would stop
what he was doinga few times a day
and eat a proper meal.
Joker Phillips is 47 and in his first
season as Kentucky's head coach
after 20 years as an assistant. He
said he has made sure to keep good
habits despite the demands of the
job.
"I still work out every day. I still
get the same amount of sleep. I just
think this game is important to me,
but my family and personal health
is more important," he said. "I am
a competitor and I do want to win,
but I'm not going to let this game
ruin my life."
2001. In 1998, the band won the
Louis C. Sudler Trophy, which the
UMass statement describes as "the
nation's top marching band honor."
Parks was inducted into the
Bands of America Hall of Fame in
2006.
He also worked as a professor
of music at UMass, teaching music
conducting and tuba.
He was awarded numerous
teaching honors, including a Dis-
tinguished Teaching Award in
1989 and an honorary degree from
the UMass Alumni Association,
according to the statement.
Parks was a driving force behind
the construction of a new $5.7 mil-
lion facility for the Minuteman
Marching Band, which is sched-
uled to open next spring and will be
named in honor of him, according
to the Globe.
Bogdan said that the naming
of the new band building "was
decided well before this all hap-
pened, but I think these things are
all going to be a part of who we are,
and he's forever going tobe a part of
who we are."
Born in Buffalo, N.Y., Parks
earned his bachelor's degree at
West Chester University in Penn-
sylvania and completed a master
of music degree at Northwestern
University.
Parks is survived by his wife
Jeanne and two children.

Rohan: There
are no easy
solutions for
this def ense

From Page 1A
to Robinson and the offense, it
wasn't.
When the Wolverines ran to
the northwest corner of the Big
House to sing "The Victors,"
the crowd joined the team in a
lackluster version of the usually
boisterous and proud anthem.
Rodriguez said that the locker
room was quiet after the game.
It's clear that even after a win,
they were aware.
They were aware that the
defense had allowed a FCS school
to rush and pass for more than
220 yards.
"Let's not pretend that we're
the 1985 Chicago Bears," Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez said
after the game. "Let's not pretend
we're that ... Three games in we
should get a little bit better and
the disappointing part is that we
didn't get better today."
Rodriguez said it was missed
tackles and a lack of attention to
fundamentals that doomed his
defense. Against Connecticut
in the opening week, that might
have been a valid excuse, but
not against the Minutemen from
Massachusetts. Michigan will
face offenses much more explo-
sive and talented when Big Ten
play starts.
Tackling and maintaining
assignments were the big issues
for the defense entering the sea-
son. But we've heard this before.
Those issues with the defense
were the same sentiments echoed
a year ago, during one of the
worst seasons defensively in
Michigan football history. Satur-
day, everyone seemed aware of
what the problem was, but how do

you fix it?
"We just didn't come out pre-
pared enough," sophomore line-
backer Craig Roh said. "I thought
we were very focused this week
in our preparation, but the thing
with this defense is we're just
going to come back here and fight
even harder. We're going to pre-
pare even harder. The concentra-
tion and drive of this defense will
not let this happen again."
A solution won't be found eas-
ily, though. Defensive coordina-
tor Greg Robinson doesn't have
the depth to rotate players who
are not performing at the level
they should be. It all starts with
Michigan's front seven. If the
Wolverines can get pressure on
the quarterback and keep the
opponents' running game in
check, the secondary can follow
suit. Michigan's most talented and
experienced defensive players are
on the line.
The talk of the offseason was
that the defense would be simpler
so that the inexperienced players
didn't have to think as much and
could just react. Michigan looked
a step behind Massachusetts all
day. The Wolverines are lucky this
wake-up call cane in a win.
When the going gets tough,
we'll see if the defense gets going.
The offense certainly will, espe-
cially if Robinson can remain
healthy.
The Massachusetts game did
reveal this: the play of the defense
could be the difference between a
January 1st bowl game and a short
drive to Detroit to play in the Lit-
tle Caesar's Pizza, Pizza Bowl.

In planning the show, Jenks

does see and learn a lot in the
30-minute span, the limitations
of the runtime take away a lot of
possibilities for further delving

but if he comes back to his audi-

stories like Maino's and presents
them in a similarly captivating
manner, it won't be long before he,
too, is thrust right into the spot-

style of show before, but Jenks
has something special going on. It
will be truly exciting to see what
he does each week.

enormously successful."
For her UMS debut, Cash will be
applying her cutting-edge style to
a very traditional set of songs from
her newest album, The List. The
album was inspired bythe advice of
Cash's legendary father.
When Cash was singing backup
vocals on her father's tour, John-
ny Cash noticed that his teenage
daughter knew very little about
country music. In order to expand
his daughter's knowledge, Cash
jotted down a list of "100 Essesntial

Country Songs" for her to explore.
"I think he was alarmed that I

had a deeply intuitive understand-
ing and overview of every criti-
cal juncture in Southern music
... These songs are as important
as the Civil War to who we are as
Americans."
More than 30 years later, Cash
selected 12 of these songs for The
List. The album includes original
covers of classics such as Hank
Cochran's "She's Got You," Danny
Dill and Marijohn Wilkin's "Long
Black Veil" and folk song "Moth-
erless Children," as well as duets
with Bruce Springsteen, Elvis
Costello and Rufus Wainwright.
Cash's concert will be the sea-
son's first Arts & Eats concert. For
$15, students will receive a ticket
to the concert, a pizza dinner and
a pre-show lecture.
In addition to Arts & Eats, fans
can find other Cash-related events
at Manheim's lecture "American
Roots/American Routes 101 -
Part 1 - Country Music" at Cob-
blestone Farms Barn tonight at 7
p.m. He will discuss the origins of
country music and its importance
in American culture, and examine

how Cash and her father contrib-
uted to this genre. Manheim also
plans to play some of the original
recordings of the songs that Cash
covered in The List.
Although this Saturday will
be Cash's UMS debut, the singer
is no stranger to Ann Arbor. In
fact, this past January, Cash per-
formed many of the songs from
The List as part of the 33rd Annu-
al Ann Arbor Folk Festival.
"It should be a great show,"
Manheim said. "I saw her do basi-
cally this show at the Ann Arbor
Folk Festival."
Manheim remembers how
humble Cash was at that perfor-
mance.
"They brought out all the art-
ists at the end with Richie Havens
and (Cash) said, 'I can't believe I
get to stand on stage with Richie
Havens.'"
Mirroring the daring nature
of Cash and her father as art-
ists, UMS is making a bold move
including a country singer in
its season lineup, which centers
around an Americas/Americans
theme. For Manheim and other
Ann Arbor country enthusiasts,
this move to "broaden the reper-
toire" is a welcome change.

'Easy A'F makes the grade.

High-school comedy

The smell of freshly ground cof-
fee beans and the chatter of stu-
dents streaming across the Diag
can only mean
one thing: the

semester. And
what better way EasyA
to usher in a AtQualityl6
shiny new school and Rave
year than with an Screen Gems
easy-breezy high
school comedy -
an heir to 2004's "Mean Girls"?
Gradually breaking out of the
role of "that-chick-who-got-
punched-in-the-eye-by-Jonah-
Hill-in-'Superbad'," Emma Stone
plays Olive, a smart, wonderfully
self-aware girl invisible to the
walking cliches strutting around
her high school. When Olive can't
admit to her best friend that the
majority of her weekend was spent
dancing on her dresser belting out
the lyrics to "Pocketful of Sun-
shine," she fabricates an initially
harmless lie about losing her vir-
ginity to an anonymous commu-
nity college guy. A few periods
later, the rumor circulates rapidly
around the school community,
instantly metamorphosing her
into the class floozy.
But instead of running away
from her new title, Olive embrac-
es it. For the price of a Home
Depot gift card, or, in the case of
one frugal desperate, a 20-per-
cent-off coupon to Bath & Body
Works, she begins a black-market
enterprise soliciting fake sex to
geeky boys and closeted gays. She
even goes as far as embroidering
a scarlet "A" (a la Hester Prynne
in "The Scarlet Letter") onto her
lacy black corsets, looking like
she emerged straight out of a
Parisian boudoir.
"I always thought pretending to
lose my virginity would be a little
more special. Judy Blume should
have prepared me for that," the
c'est la vie Olive proclaims.

"A' is for "Why are you wearing A corset to school!?"

Confidently grabbing hold of
the film's reins, director Will
Gluck ("Fired Up!") imbues "Easy
A" with enough barb to zing, but
without sacrificing the good cheer
of a comedy - its bright, scissor-
sharp dialogue never recedes to
toxic snark. It also helps that the
film is supported by a cast of gold.
Patricia Clarkson ("Cairo Time")
and the always-great Stanley
Tucci ("The Devil Wears Prada")
play Olive's happy-go-lucky, hip-
pie parents with screwball 6lan.
Amanda Bynes ("She's the Man"),
who announced and then shortly
unannounced her retirement from
acting on Twitter, almost steals
the show as the goody-goody
Christian girl thirsting after the
salvation of Olive's supposedly
depraved soul.
None of this means, however,
that "Easy A" is without its stum-
bling points. Olive undergoes a

bizarre quest for morality and
religion late in her charade, and
the film spends too much time
indulging in its array of admitted-
ly stock characters. Yet for each
of its missteps, "Easy A" rewards
the viewer with more than double
the charm. In this kind of genre
film, it's really about the attitude
behind the celluloid, and "Easy A"
possesses this in spades.
A lot of this has to do with the
film's young heroine. With her
flowy auburn waves and rockstar
rasp, Stone is truly a pre-rehab
Lindsay Lohan reincarnated. If
the '80s brought us the cherub-
faced, misunderstood Molly Ring-
wald, the '90s California-sweet,
dizzy dame Alicia Silverstone in
"Clueless" and the '00s foaming-
at-the-mouth-for-popularity
Lohan in "Mean Girls," Stone's
Olive is everything we want our
new decade to represent. She's a

protagonist self-aware enough
to envy and understand her pop-
culture predecessors, but mired
in enough teenaged insecurity
junk to be relatable. Although
Olive is a role that any of Disney's
pretty young things could poten-
tially pull off, Stone's cool, genu-
ine deadpan singlehandedly pulls
the film into the pantheon of teen
culture classics. Make no mistake,
Hollywood - Stone has the stuff
of a superstar.
This fame, however, might last
more transiently than expected.
With Silverstone having retreated
into the background only, a short
while after catapulting into super-
stardom, and Lohan going down
the express train to celebrity
annihilation, the future has never
been too friendly to these talented
young ingenues. Let's just hope
that Stone isn't met with similar
obstacles.

The unthinkable was about to
happen.
The Michigan football team
stood 73 seconds away from head-
ing into halftime down by double
digits. Massachusetts running
back Jonathan Hernandez had just
pranced into the endzonecto put the
Minutemen up 17-7, and an Appala-
chian State-level upset was clearly
brewing in Michigan Stadium.

No better time to turn to blind
faith.
Or, as sophomore quarterback
sensation Denard Robinson and
junior wide receiver Darryl Sto-
num would say, trustaand timing.
With 1:17 leftinthesecond quar-
ter, Robinson threw a screen pass
to Stonum, who simply out-weaved
and outran the Massachusetts
defense for a 66-yard touchdown.
The play was followed up by a
Michigan fumble recovery, and
eventually a nine-yard touchdown

pass to Stonum.
The Wolverines had a lead at
halftime, and they would manage
to hold on for a42-37victory.
Ship righted - starting with the
one big play.
"I know where (Robinson) is
going to be; he knows where to
throw it," Stonum said. "I can't
really see him - our line is so tall,
he's not the tallest guy on the field.
I know where the ball is going to
squirt out, and he knows where I'm
going to be. That's all trust and tim-

ing."
Stonum's play, Michigan's
recovered fumble and Stonum's
subsequent touchdown gave the
Wolverines momentum heading
into the second half. Michigan
received the ball first to start the
half, and opened with two consecu-

After the U-M Soccer Complex's
dedication ceremony in front of a
record crowd of 3,503 on Friday,
the Michigan men's soccer team had
fans on the edge of their seats, as it
played 110:00 minutes of back-and-

Notre Dame.
Both teams ended the night with
seven shots on goal, but none found
their way past either keeper as the
match ended in a 0-0 tie after double

The Wolverines (3-1-3) came out
strong and looked to capitalize on
their momentum from their 1-0 win

but couldn't seem to finish any of

At everyone of the Daily's mass meetings,
I try to take some time to talk sports with any
students interested in writing for the sports sec-
tion.
Usually I start off by ask-
ing them what sportthey're
most passionate about and -
want to cover the most on
campus. For me, and most of
the other students who come
out to write sports, that's
football. And it's often not RYAN
even close. KARTJE
But at the latest mass
meetings, the majority of students said they
were interested in a different kind of football -
the one with a "u" and an "o" and a significantly
different ball. And each time, I did a double-
take.
This is the University of Michigan, after all,
and all ofyou just want to cover soccer?
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watchingsoc-
cer. My roommates and I woke up every day for
weeks at 7 a.m. in order to watch every single
World Cup match we could possibly consume.
And the Americans' win over Algeria in the
match's waning seconds is one of the best fin-
ishes I've ever seen in a sporting event.
But I'm not an avid follower of Manchester
United. I don't scour ESPNSoccer for Premier
League highlights. And I surely can't saythat
I'm the proud owner of an Ibrahimovic, No. 8
Inter-Milan jersey, whatever that is.
But it's becoming increasingly obvious that
the restof the Michigan sports environment may
be slowly shifting, albeit slightly, in a fdtbol, not
football, direction.
On Friday, when the athletic department
christened the brand new, beautiful U-M Soc-
cer Complex, 3,503 people came out to watch an
incredible, double-overtime draw with Notre
Dame that saw probably 100 people confined
to standing room only, behind the South goal.
There wasn't even sitting room for some Notre
Dame players' parents.
And now with a relevant student group - the
Michigan Ultras - planting the seeds for a great
student section, it's clear that this whole Michi-
gan soccer thingcould be going somewhere -
and fast.
By my rules, a program budding in popularity
needs three things to remain relevant: a great

Youth movement
gives Blue a boost

niordefenseman Chase Tennant executes a throw-in during the Wolverin(

By BRIAN MECHANICK
Daily Sports Editor
A youth movement has been
felt early and often for the Michi-
gan women's soccer team.
Freshmen Nkem Ezurike
and Tori McCombs entered the
weekend with three and two
goals respectively, finishing as
the top two on the team. The
dynamic duo continued their
torrid pace on Friday against
Massachusetts, as Ezurike
scored a pair of goals, while
McCombs added another.
But two new rookies on
the squad emerged and made
their presence felt Friday.
Freshmen Kayla Manino and
Meghan Toohey each got on the
scoresheet for the first time, as
Manino tallied her first goal and
Toohey earned her first assist.
Manino played just 24 min-
utes, but made her presence felt
in scoring the second goal of the
game.
After receiving a pass from
Ezurike, Manino dribbled in on
a breakaway and calmly beat the
keeper on a low finish to the side
netting. The impact of her first
collegiate goal seemed not to hit
Manino immediately judging by
her modest celebration on the
field.
"I didn't really know what
to think," Kayla Manino said.
"It didn't quite hit me at first, it
wasn't until I was in the locker
room at halftime that it sunk in.
On the field, it was all kind of a
big blur."
Though Toohey stands at just
5-feet even, she was a giant in the
middle of the field for the Wol-
verines.
In her 80 minutes, Toohey
made a massive impact, playing

the part of a box-to-box midfield-
er with much more poise than
one would expect of a player six
games into her career.
The assist from Toohey first
came from tackling a UMass
player in her own half, then deliv-
ering a beautiful through-ball 30
yards down the field to set up
Ezurike's second goal.
"[Getting my first assist] was
really great," Meghan Toohey
said. "I'm really confident in our
team. The environment we play
in pumps everybody up, and it
was great to take part in it."
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
worked hard to recruit a dynam-
ic attacking freshman class to
complement his veteran defense,
and he was proud to see two new
inexperienced players rise to the
challenge.
"Meaghan Toohey is such
a dynamic player," Ryan said.
"She can run through defenses
by herself and she can do work
on the defensive end. One of the
best two-way players I've ever
coached. Kayla is very smooth,
confident, and composed with
the ball, so when she got a chance
she made it look easy. Other play-
ers think they have to bang it
hard, she just rolls it under the
keeper. They're both doing really
well."
With conference play coming
up, the Wolverines will have to
rely more and more on their
talented freshman class. Still,
this pair seems as humble as
ever, even on a day when they
shined.
"The older girls have taught us
so much already," Toohey said.
"How hard they work is very
inspiring for us, so I think we all
bust our butt to make this team a

The great place to play is obvious, as the$6
million, state-of-the-art soccer complex is, bar
none, one of the best places to play in college soc-
cer.
The women's soccer team - despite it's sub-
par record in the past few years - is coached by
much-talked-about headman Greg Ryan who
helmed the U.S. Women's Soccer team to a 45-1-9
record from 2005 to 2007. If not for a controver-
sial call to bench goalie Hope Solo, Ryan would
still be the team's coach. Fired or not, he's got to
be a hell of a coach to amass that kind of record.
And men's soccer coach Steve Burns is no
slouch either, basically having the built the pro-
gram with his bare hands into a Big Ten title
contender.
But most important, both teams are winning
and doing it in exciting ways.
The Saad brothers, Hamoody and Soony have
taken the men's soccer team by storm, scoring
at will and accounting for six of the team's nine

goals. Plus, the possibilities of Saad brothers-
themed student section chants and small cult
followings seem absolutely endless.
And the women's team boasts a similar pair
of exciting young players in Nkem Ezurike and
Meghan Toohey who are just as exciting, with
just as many possibilities for students to get
behind.
Look, I'm not foolish enough to think that this
past summer's World Cup is ready to vault soc-
cer into the hierarchy of American sports. It's
just not that simple. And every argument to that
effect that always falls short.
But a seed has most definitely been planted
in Ann Arbor, and it may only be a short time
before the whole campus wears their Soony Saad
or Meghan Toohey jerseys down State Street on
Futbol Saturday.

Blue, led by Hunt, sweeps on Arizona trip

M' wins twice in
uneven weekend

By ZAK PYZIK
Daily Sports Editor
After a rough first set against Arizona State,
frustration kicked in for the Michigan volleyball
team. Early in the second, junior outside hitter
Alex Hunt nailed the ball over the net from the
back row and it pegged a Sun Devil in the face,
providing the Wolverines with some momen-
tum. From there, they took control.
Arizona State outplayed Michigan 25-12 in
that first set on Friday. Eleven months and 94
sets have gone by since the Wolverines last lost a
set by such a wide margin.
Though No. 21 Michigan has some newer
faces this year, it didn't take the team much time
to realize what it had to do to defeat the Sun
Devils and win another tournament title, their
second in two weeks. The Wolverines focused
on getting into a rhythm, and they did that on
Friday night by winning the next three sets in
their opening match of the Arizona State Uni-
versity Sheraton Tournament.

Michigan carried its offensive momentum
into the second half, netting three more goals to
seal the deal. The Wolverines showed their abil-

coach Mark Rosen said. "You can't always play
at the same level. They started off really well but
we had to try to figure them out. As the match
progressed, we found our rhythm. It would be
nice to dominate the entire time but that's not
how it is in any sport really."
The Wolverines (11-1) continued their run by
defeating Utah and then Pacific, both in four-set
matches to claim the tournament title. Michi-
gan boasts a 4-0 record in four-set matches this
season.
Michigan lost its first set to Pacific 25-16 but
then claimed three straight by no fewer than six
points in each.
Junior outside hitter Alex Hunt led the Wol-
verines with 23 kills and four service aces in
their final match.
"There were times we went to Alex and went
out of balance on purpose because she was so
hot," Rosen said. "You want to feed the hot play-
er ... Other players were playing so well so they
couldn't just focus on her. She didn't get the ball
much more, she just played it more efficiently."
Hunt tallied 68 kills over the entire weekend
ity to score notionlylin live-action play, butoffset-
pieces as well.
But the story was different as Michigan tal-
lied its second win of the weekend against
Youngstown State (2-7-0). The Wolverines con-
trolled the game once again, with the majority
of the 90-minute game spent not just in the Pen-
guins' half of the field, but within their 18-yard
box.

"The concentration just wasn't

Even with the faults of the newly
recruited attacking talent, the
Wolverines still have a solid defen-
sive line that was able to maintain
composure. The strength of the
back line is led mostly by the vet-
eran players on the team, including
senior co-captain defender Jackie
Carron.
Defensively, Michigan only
allowed two shots on goal and
stomped over any offensive oppor-

have had to tie up the game.
"We are really solid as a group

A joint effort of both the offense
and defense will be needed this
upcoming weekend as the team
breaks into Big Ten play, opening up
at home against Ohio State.
"It's gonna be a really hard bat-

on Sunday, one day after pulling
out a 4-3 double-overtime win
against No. 19 Albany.
Michigan (4-4) outshot the
Bobcats 16-1 by halftime and 30-5
over the entire game. Quinnipac
(2-5) never even threatened to
score, whereas the Wolverines
could have reached double dig-
its in goals if not for a few near
misses.
"Our passing was really
strong," Michigan coach Marcia
Pankratz said. "We followed the
gameplan, set up alot of chances,
and shot the ball pretty accu-
rately."
Senior forward/midfielder
Alicia Mayer continued her scor-
ing tear with two goals Sunday.
She also had two goals and two
assists on Saturday against Alba-
ny (4-2).
"I feel like I've gotten my spark
back the last couple of games,"
Mayer said.
Mayer is the team's leading
scorer, with five goals and four
assists for a total of 14 points this
season.
"Alicia is one of the keys to
our team," Pankratz said. "She's
a senior, has a lot of experience
and brings great energy to the
game. So when she's on it's big
for us."
Senior midfielder Meredith

JsAe-sOMM/Daily
Senior Meredith Way (pictured here) is one of the top 10 scorers in school history.

Way also got in on the act, scor-
ing the team's third goal off a
penalty corner on assists from
senior forward/midfielder Paige
Laytos and freshman midfielder
Mallory Albini. It was the 35th
goal of her career, putting her on
Michigan's top 10 career goals
list.
"Mallory made a good inside
stop on the ball," Way said. "Then
I just shot it low and hard, and it
bounced off a defender's foot and
went in."
A major weakness of last year's
team was that it relied too heav-
ily on Way for goals. In fact, she
scored more than half of the Wol-
verines' goals in 2009. This year,
however, the team has been far
more balanced and Way is only
fourth on the team in goals this
season.
"My role has definitely
changed a lot this year," Way
said. "Because everyone else is
stepping up and carrying the
scoring load, I'm able to be a lot
more defensive-minded."
Victory against Albany on Sat-
urday didn't come as easily as it
would on Sunday.
The Wolverines twice took
leads only to see their opponents
rally and tie the game each time.
Junior forward/midfielder Katie
Adams won the game in double-
overtime with a goal in the 92nd
minute.
Michigan's pair of wins this
weekend mean the team has won
its last four games after losing
the first four of the season.
"I absolutely think we can
keep this winning streak up,"
Mayer said. "We've worked on
a few things since the first four
games, and now we're really
connecting well as a team. Our
vision's improved; We're bet-
ter at anticipating where our
teammates will be on every
play."

Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez has a message for the Wol-
verinestudenttbody:
"Any student out there who's
enrolled at the
University and NOTEBOOK
is in good aca-
demic standing and a good guy
and can kick field goals and can
kick the ball into the end zone,"
Rodriguez said. "We'll have
another tryout for yu."
It maybe more of a message to
Michigan's kickers.
Michigan's special teams
struggled mightily once again
this week during the Wolver-
ines' 42-37 win over Massachu-
setts.
Redshirt freshman Seth
Broekhuizen missed the only
Michigan field goal attempt, a
39-yarder in the third quarter,
making Wolverine placekickers
a combined 1-for-5 on the sea-
son.
But it's not only the field
goals the coaches are worried
about. Brendan Gibbons, also
a redshirt freshman, has been
handling the kickoff duties for
the first two weeks of the sea-
son with unsatisfying results.
His kicks often land near the 10
or 15-yard line and have little
hangtime, which doesn't give the
kickoff team enough time to get
downfield.
The coaches gave Broekhui-
zen a shot at kicking off on Sat-
urday and were happier with his
performance.
"I thought Seth kicked bet-
ter," Rodriguez said after the
game. "He got down to the five a
couple times, with better hang-
time. Brendan hadn't been kick
ing well."
The placekickers weren't the
only ones struggling. Highly-
touted freshman punter Will
Hagerup has also had his share
of trials this season, and they
continued on Saturday. Hag-

After Robinson carried the ball
29 and 28 times in the first twoo
games, respectively, he only had
to carry the ball 16 times against
Massachusetts. That decrease
can almost entirely be credited
to Shaw and fellow running back
VincenttSmith, who accounted for
45yards on11 carries.
"That was part of the plan to be
quite honest with you," offensive
coordinator Calvin Magee said.
"We went into it since game one,

game.
The Michigan defense was truly
the story of the night. The Wol-
verines were forced to defend nine
Fighting Irish corner kicks, but on
a night when Blais tied his then-
careerlhigh forsaves (seven), Mich-
igan wasn't letting Notre Dame
capitalize on any of them.
Defender Chase 'Tennant cred-
ited the discipline of the back line
and Blais, as the Fighting Irish
offense was visibly frustrated all
night.
"(Notre Dame) came on
full force," ennant said. -
"They had some really
good forwards that were
very fast. But defensively,
we've been playing great,
and one of the things
we've been working on is
to not let the other team
score and to not let them
get in behind us.
"I was so proud of the
whole backline, because
as soon as a ball slipped
in behindus, wewould get
back and block the shots
or crosses or anything
thatwas comioighbock." t
Coming off thec tic at
home on Friday, Michi-
gan had little time to
regroup as the team trav-
eled to Milwaukee totake
on Marquette on Sunday.

middle of the toughest
portion of their sched-
ule, playing five games
in ten days starting with

two pints and fumbled a snap,
which resulted in the punt being
blocked.
"It's an inexperience thing,"
Hagerup said. "Yougo from high
school with a couple thousand
people, then you play out here.
It's getting experience, getting
used to the game and getting
comfortable. It'll come ...special
teams is definitely something
that sticks out as something our
team has to get better at."
Hagerup alsosaid that despite
the struggles of the kickers, he
has not been asked to kick field
goals.
BACKUPS STAY ON THE
BENCH: The plan going into the
game on Saturday was to give
the backups an opportunity to
play. Massachusetts is, after all,
a Football Championship Sub-
division team.
Especially pressing was get-
ting some snaps for the backup
quarterbacks, freshman Devin
Gardner and sophomore Tate
Forcier. Not only did the coach-
es want to get the two some game
action, but they also wanted to
rest sophomore Denard Rob-
inson, who took a lot of punish-
ment in the first two weeks of the
season.
But the Minutemen flipped
feeding them, and I'm glad (they)
did okay."
Running backs coach Fred
Jackson said much of Shaw's and
Smith's previous struggles in the
run game had to do with the ball-
carrier's impatience after receiv-
ing thehandoff. Instead ofwaiting
for their blocks, Shaw and Smith
often darted straight intoothe hole,
which led to a lot of tackles in the
backfield.
Against the Minutemen, how-
ever, Shaw made sure to hesitate
and see his blocks. Andwith a brief
stutter on a handoff in the third
quarter, Shaw'spatiencepaidoffas
he took it tolthe house for a 34-yard
touchdown.
Jackson said a running back's
patience with those handoffs is
something that comes with expe-
rience, which Shaw and Smith

the script and kept the game
close, forcing Michigan to keep
Robinson and most of its start-
ers in the entire game.
"If we would have played bet-
ter, we could have played more
guys," Rodriguez said. "But that
didn't happen."
Still, fans were looking for-
ward to seeing other players get
some action, including running
backs freshman Stephen Hop-
kins, redshirt sophomore Mike
Cox and redshirt freshman
Fitzgerald Toussaint
In the end, it wasn't meant
to be. The incumbent running
backs, junior Michael Shaw and
sophomore Vincent Smith, got
all the carries and excelled.
"It was the plan to get the
other guys in, but obviously we
didn't play well enough to do
that," Smith said.
One backup who did get
some playing time was redshirt
freshman offensive lineman
Taylor Leian. The 6-foot-8
294-pound left tackle hadn't
played in the first two games,
other than one snap against
Notre Dame last week. He was
neck-and-neck with the starter,

third quarter on Saturday.
"The first drive, I was so ner-
vous. My heart was leating a
thousand milesperhour," Lewan
said. "At the end of the drive, I
was so tired. I was wondering,
'Why am I so tired right now?'
because usually I'm not tired at
all. Then I realized, that's just
first-game jitters. After the first
series, things started going real
well."
FIRST TURNOVER OF THE
YEAR: For the first two games of
this season, Michigan had been
turnover-free.
After tallying 16 turnovers
last year, holding onto the ball
on offense was a point ofoempha-
sis th roughout the offseason. It's
clearly paid off - while Michi-
gan has fumbled the ball three
times, the Wolverines have yet
to lose one.
And until Robinson's first
pass on Saturday, he hadn't
thrown an interception.
After lie threw the pick early
in the game against Massachu-
setts, Robinson came back to the
bench smiling.
"He came off to the sidelines
with a smile on his face," junior
wideout Darryl Stonum said.
"And he looked at us and was
like 'Look guys, I got that off my
system.'"

UMASS
From Page 1B
Robinson's own eight-yard dash
into the endzone. By the middle of
the third quarter, all facets of the
offense were final ly clicking.
""They created a couple of prob-
lems for us on the first few drives,"
senior offensive lineman Steve
Schilling said. "We just had to
get the motor going - took a little
while to start up."
But Michigan's sloppy play in
the fourth quarter from missed
tackles to a seemingly flustered
special teams unit - allowed the
Minutemen to claw their way back
into the game. Massachusetts
torched the Wolverines for three
touchdowns in the fourth. Michi-
gan's 35-17 lead at the beginning
of the quarter melted into a 42-37
edge with just over two minutes
remaining.
Massachusetts's onside kick
went out of bounds at the 2:05
mark, giving Michigan the ball,
and it was all but over then. Rob-
inson and the rest of the offense
remained poised and got the first
down they needed to run out the
clock.
After the game, the Wolverines'
mood was rather subdued. Schil-
ling said the win was more of a
relief than anything, and that he
felt lucky to leave the stadium with
a victory.
Redshirt freshman tackle Tay-
lor Lewan called it a "bittersweet
feeling."
"You can't be upset with a win,
but you can be upset with the way
you played, and we did not play
well," Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez said in the post-game press
conference.
Robinson's final statistics were
impressive (though not quite on
par with his record-breaking
performances from the past two
weeks): 10-of-14 for 241 yards and
two touchdowns in the air, 17 car-
ries for 104 yards and one rushing
touchdown.
"I guess you could say the one
thing to take away was we held
Robinson to only about 350 yards
- if that's a bonus," Massachusetts
coach Kevin Morris said.
If Morris wanted to hit a more
positive note, he'd point outthat his
offense exposed quite a few holes
in the Michigan defense through-
out the game. Massachusetts quar-
terback Kyle Havens picked apart
the Wolverine secondary at will,
going 22-of-29 for 222 yards with
two touchdowns.
Members of Michigan's defense
were adamant after the game that
they would learn from their mis-
takes and improve by next week-
end's matchup.
"Bowling Green they're not
going to see this team next week,"
redshirt freshman safety Thomas
Gordan said.
Added sophomore linebacker
Craig Roh: "The thing with this
defense is we're just going to come
back here and fight even harder.
We're going to prepare even hard-
er. The concentration and drive of
th is defense will not let this hap-
pen again."

THE OUICK BREAKDOWN


MAIZE GAUGE

The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Spread-o-Meter measures the success of quarterbacks, the Rod-o-Meter
judges how emotional (positive or negative) Rich Rodriguez was following the game and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

4/4
Denards

If Michigan's offense is going to put up 42 points with
525 total yards (241 passing, 284 rushing), the Wolver-
ines are going to continue earning four Denards. Sopho-
more quarterback Denard Robinson got sharper as the
game went on, and he impressed with his arm this week.

2/
Rich Rods

Michigan coach Rich Rodriguezwas less than thrilled
after his team defeated an FCS opponent by five
points (but it's better than losing - ask coach Carr).
He called out his kickers, expressed disappointment
in the defense and seemed relieved to be 3-0.

weak FCS opponent, Michigan Stadium wasfull
and lively. Add in the well executed double wave
Big Houses late in the game, and we've got to hand it to the stu-
dent section - especially on a holiday weekend.

Right guard Patrick Omameh got up the field and put a block on the
other defensive back on the left side of the defense. Stonum ran around
the block and then broke his run to the outside. The defensive back did
get off of Omameh's block to catch Stonum down the field. But Stonum
broke the tackle and beat the other Massachusetts defenders to the
endzone. Stonum scored the go-ahead touchdown 45 seconds later.
