The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

transition to online classes has 

presented 
unique 
obstacles 
for 

fine arts students, who have had 

their recitals impacted, face issues 

obtaining necessary materials and 

experience difficulty practicing their 

disciplines remotely.

The University announced plans 

to move to online classes on March 

11 amid an outbreak of coronavirus 

in the state. As students transition 

to attending lectures, discussions, 

office hours and lab meetings on 

online teaching programs such as 

Zoom and BlueJeans, students in the 

School of Art & Design and the School 

of Music, Theatre & Dance said their 

departments have been particularly 

impacted by the end of in-person 

learning and events. 

Music, Theatre & Dance senior 

Cole Abod said the change has added 

further uncertainty to students in his 

program. 

“There’s just a lot of instability 

being piled on top of an already 

uncertain field where you’re jumping 

from freelance job to freelance job,” 

Abod said. “It is just an incredibly 

unfortunate situation no matter how 

you slice it.” 

Abod said he was unable to 

perform his senior recital in-person 

because of the outbreak.

“I’m losing out on a senior recital 

and a premiere of an original 

theatrical work that I wrote,” Abod 

said. “The senior recital is required 

for me to get my degree, and I think 

the handling of that was not ideal 

— originally, we were all told that 

we had to hold our degree recitals 

throughout 
this 
while 
central 

administration was telling students 

to go home … My department has 

given us the flexibility to hold live 

stream recitals or create some other 

senior project.” 

Music, Theatre & Dance senior 

Johanna Kepler noted that with 

a 
physical 
discipline, 
virtual 

instruction is a significant change 

of pace, but noted that the dance 

department has kept its students 

informed during this period of 

uncertainty. 

“It’s been a big challenge,” Kepler 

said. “We do such a physical daily 

practice and taking a dance class 

online is nothing like being in a room 

with other dancers.” 

In an email to The Daily, Music, 

Theatre & Dance Dean Mark Clague 

outlined how the administration 

planned to mitigate the disruption 

and noted things are going better 

than expected. He said the school 

is constantly searching for ways to 

adapt to remote learning.

“We’ve had a sequence of faculty 

conference calls to share ideas, tips and 

discoveries about how to make remote 

instruction in the arts successful 

and we’ve shared online resources 

and provided technical support to 

individual faculty,” Clague wrote. 

Each month, The Michigan Daily 

sits down with the University of 

Michigan President Mark Schlissel 

to discuss important questions about 

University policy, commitments and 

challenges. This month, the interview 

was 
conducted 
virtually. 
Topics 

discussed in this month’s interview 

included COVID-19, sexual misconduct 

allegations against faculty and GEO 

bargaining. 

This interview has been edited and 

condensed for clarity.

President 
Schlissel 
started 
off 

the interview by emphasizing the 

importance of the census and urged all 

University students to fill it out.

Mark Schlissel: You know, one is a 

reminder to students about the census. 

Every 10 years — and it happens to be 

this year — we’re doing this nationwide 

census. It’s in the constitution, it is 

important to determine the distribution 

of all kinds of federal benefits and also 

how many Congresspeople represent 

each part of each state. So it’s a really 

big deal. And if you live in the dorm, 

you’re automatically counted, but if 

you live off campus or no longer on or 

near campus, you should use your off 

campus address and go ahead and file 

for the census. 

The Michigan Daily: Have you or 

any other members of the University of 

Michigan administration been tested 

for COVID-19?

University of Michigan President: ‘We’ve adapted pretty darn fast’

Cancellation of 
March Madness 
hurts local business

While some local Ann Arbor 

businesses have continued operations 

amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many 

are struggling to maintain profits. A 

new study from data and technology 

company Womply shows businesses 

may lose even more revenue due to 

the cancellation of the NCAA March 

Madness basketball tournament.

Brad 
Plothow, 
vice 
president 

of brand and communications at 

Womply, said major sporting events 

like the tournament typically bring 

in a significant amount of business, 

especially in a college city. 

“Not only are businesses missing 

out on general revenue because 

people aren’t leaving their homes 

right now, but they’re also missing 

out on the major increase in revenue 

that they would typically see during 

this time of year because of the 

NCAA tournament,” Plothow said. 

“College towns are especially prone 

to the economic consequences of 

something like this because the 

universities are shut down and so a 

lot of students have gone home.”

According 
to 
Plothow, 
local 

restaurants saw a consumer spending 

increase of 7 percent during the 

tournament last year. Plothow noted 

the largest spike in sales occurred 

during 
the 
championship 
game 

when spending was up 36 percent. 

His team used data from 36,000 

restaurants across the United States 

to find out what business owners 

could have expected for 2020 

before the COVID-19 outbreak. He 

said some of the data came from 

Womply’s customers, but most of it 

was from non-affiliated businesses.

“I think our point of view is that 

public health is the most important 

thing, but the question is, ‘How 

do you contain the impact of the 

pandemic so that you also contain 

the impact on small businesses?’” 

Plothow said. “This data is for small 

businesses so that they could see 

what the seasonality of their business 

might look like so that they can make 

better decisions about how they 

think about staffing or promotions.”

Plothow 
estimates 
U.S. 

restaurants may lose up to $1.1 

billion due to the cancellation of the 

tournament. He added retail stores 

may not be as affected because they 

don’t have fixed costs or perishable 

items.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 

D-Mich., held a conference call 

this afternoon with various media 

outlets to briefly discuss the details 

of the Coronavirus Relief Bill passed 

by Congress. According to Dingell, 

the $2 trillion would be sectioned 

off into seven main categories: 

individual, small businesses, large 

businesses/corporations, hospitals 

and public health, local and state 

governments, federal safety net 

and education. 

Dingell 
said 
the 
bill 
will 

hopefully boost the economy and 

keep the workforce intact. 

“My prayer is at the end of this 

they’re going to have jobs to go back 

to,” Dingell said. “That’s one of the 

things we worked really hard to get 

into this bill, that any help was tied 

into protecting the workers.”

Dingell highlighted some of the 

areas the bill focuses on and said 

it will boost supplies for personal 

protection 
equipment, 
which 

includes masks and gloves. 

“(The bill) provides direct aid 

to the healthcare institutions, it 

boosts supplies of the personal 

protection equipment in critical 

medical care,” Dingell said. 

The bill will also supply funding 

for both small and large businesses. 

Dingell emphasized how important 

funding for the auto industry would 

be, saying that there are roughly 17 

million jobs directly connected to 

the auto industry. 

Dingell 
likened 
the 
global 

pandemic to “an invisible enemy” 

and said this bill will hopefully give 

them enough for their “arsenal.”

“We’re at war … with an invisible 

enemy, and we don’t have enough 

tools in our arsenal,” Dingell said. 

“This bill is going to get us there 

and if it’s not enough, we’re going 

to have to do more. But we need to 

give people hope. We need to put 

stimulus into the economy.”

Dingell 
emphasized 
how 

dependent America is on getting 

medicine and medical supplies 

from China. She said she hopes that 

there is some type of investment to 

change this dependency.

“We 
need 
a 
massive 

infrastructure bill,” Dingell said. 

“Hopefully, when we come out of 

this we’re going to invest in what 

we need to invest in — at the same 

time, we’re going to be creating 

jobs which ultimately make our 

economy stronger. We’ll put more 

money in and we’ll create more 

revenue.”

Dingell urged everyone to follow 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s call to 

“stay home and stay safe,” and to 

use technology to remain in contact 

with others during this time. 

“We got to do what we got to 

do which is stay home,” Dingell 

said. “(But) we have to remain in 

contact and check in with each 

other. We have to stay together as a 

community and if we stay together 

as a community, we’re going to get 

through this.”

One 
reporter 
asked 
about 

unemployment benefits for the self-

employed since many have had their 

claims rejected. According to NPR, 

the new bill creates a temporary 

Pandemic 
Unemployment 

Assistance program that will serve 

through the end of the year. 

Dingell 
responded 
that 
she 

was 
unsure 
if 
unemployment 

claims will now be automatically 

reviewed. 

“This 
legislation 
is 
dealing 

with 
people 
directly 
impacted 

by 
coronavirus,” 
Dingell 
said. 

“If they have lost their job or are 

not getting income related to the 

coronavirus, they should, I hate to 

say this, reapply. If they are having 

problems, my office is open seven 

days a week.”

WXYZ-TV news reporter Jim 

Kiertzner 
asked 
Dingell 
about 

President Donald Trump’s tweets 

directing 
criticism 
at 
General 

Motors and Ford Motor Company.

“He’s going after General Motors 

and Ford for not wrapping up 

production of ventilators, of masks 

and so on,” Kiertzner said. 

Dingell replied that she has also 

read the tweets, but would prefer 

to deal with the pandemic over the 

politics. 

“I have stayed on top of this 

issue from day one,” Dingell said. 

“We need all the help we can get 

in Michigan. We’re going to be the 

epicenter. We’re going to be like 

New York, faster than any of us 

wants to think about it. Nobody 

wants to get into a pissing contest 

with the president, we need his 

leadership right now.”

Dingell said she believed the 

large three auto companies — Ford, 

Chrysler and GM — are doing what 

they can to provide ventilators, 

but she said some type of federal 

“management” is necessary. 

MediaNews 
Group 
journalist 

Dave Herndon asked Dingell if 

there was a plan for those still in 

school, K-12 specifically. 

“Governor Whitmer was talking 

about the possibility of the school 

year being over in Michigan, I was 

wondering, is there something 

that the Congress is working on?” 

Herndon asked. 

Dingell replied that though there 

are currently no plans on a national 

level because education is largely 

a state issue, the schools will only 

reopen when it is completely safe 

to do so, regardless of the timeline. 

“We probably won’t hit an apex 

in Michigan for two to three 

weeks,” Dingell said. “I don’t know 

when we’re going to reopen. We’ll 

open the schools when it’s safe to 

open the schools. The first priority 

right now is to keep people safe and 

that means not gathering in large 

groups, and quite frankly I don’t 

know what’s going to happen, but I 

think it’s pretty likely that we will 

not open schools until the fall.”

i painstakingly paint my nails every week last 

week it was bubblegum blue. from up close

 

they must look so trite and clumsy. i need to stop

biting them, but blood from my fingertips

 

tastes sweeter than from anywhere else. 

i know this, i don’t know why. sometimes

 

i like to pretend i am folding in on myself i am

jealous of origami swans and the way they know

 

how to bend in all the right places i am jealous

of their fragility my body is all too big, too sturdy

to bend it is all points and hard edges in places

not conducive for swan-ness i don’t know how to 

 

unfold them. i keep dreaming of myself pulling out 

my nails one by one to sell for something

 

i can never remember what i don’t think i should’ve been 

given a body shouldn’t have been trusted with this one 

bodies are made for worship and i can only hear 

God’s voice at the bottom of my own desperation 

my mother says why do you insist on ruining these 

hands that God gave you? well, these hands came 

 

with a lot of strings attached is it not obvious i am 

trying to sever them. i am willing to make a trade,

however, i want a small metamorphosis. after all, 

this thing that God loves most? i am willing to 

give it back that is worth at least becoming a house cat

or a raccoon. my nails are bright red and it is not enough 

to stop me from tearing into myself. my mouth is rattling 

against its cage like an animal awaiting slaughter

According to the CDC, 160 to 

214 million Americans could be 

infected by the novel coronavirus 

over the course of the pandemic. 

Of those infected, 200,000 to 1.7 

million are projected to die. The 

sudden onslaught of COVID-19 

has taken the nation by surprise. 

Cracks in the United States health 

infrastructure have been exposed, 

amplifying 
feeble 
preparedness 

and ability to protect the average 

Americans, let alone the most 

vulnerable populations. The elderly 

and those with predisposed health 

issues have been found to have a 

higher risk of developing severe 

symptoms, and while this is true, 

this analysis only scratches the 

surface of understanding what 

populations 
remain 
especially 

vulnerable. In addition to class 

differences, which have already 

been noted due to unequal access 

to tests between the rich and the 

poor, environmental quality is also 

a factor. In her book Farming While 

Black, environmental activist Leah 

Penniman outlines the relationship 

between 
environmental 
racism 

and 
negative 
health 
outcomes 

in Black, Brown and Indigenous 

communities. 
Using 
this 

framework, 
we 
can 
apply 
an 

intersectional lens to understand 

how gaps in environmental justice 

and public health are setting 

communities of color up for tragedy. 

Environmental racism describes 

the disproportionate impact of 

environmental hazards, including 

toxic 
waste 
facilities, 
garbage 

dumps and other polluters which 

ultimately 
lower 
the 
quality 

of life for low socioeconomic 

groups. Spearheading the birth 

of 
the 
Environmental 
Justice 

movement of the 1970s, discourse 

on environmental racism works to 

uncover how policy, enforcement 

of laws and regulations, deliberate 

targeting of people of color for 

toxic waste facilities and exclusion 

of people of color from ecology 

movements affect environmental 

quality. In 2018, EPA researchers 

confirmed that race, not poverty, is 

the strongest predictor of exposure 

to health-threatening particulate 

matter. The EPA also found that 

Black Americans are significantly 

more exposed to air pollutants, 

resulting in higher rates of lung 

disease, heart disease and cancer. 

Applying these frameworks at a local 

level, The University of Michigan’s 

School of Public Health estimates 

that air pollution kills more than 

650 Detroiters a year — more than 

twice the number of residents killed 

by gun violence annually. As stated 

previously, the severity and death 

rate of the coronavirus increases 

for those with chronic heart and 

lung conditions. By looking at 

the current health prognosis for 

many Black American citizens, we 

can anticipate that Black people 

and others in low-socioeconomic 

statuses are going to be among 

those most strongly affected by 

COVID-19. 

Considering the longstanding, 

generational 
influences 
of 

environmental 
racism 
and 
the 

pitiful response of the Trump 

administration 
towards 
the 

coronavirus, 
the 
potential 
for 

positive change is bleak. Since his 

election, the Trump administration 

has rolled back 95 environmental 

rules and protections at the expense 

of environmental preservation and 

public health. The administration 

has steadily chipped away at 

the 
EPA’s 
funding, 
minimized 

environmental 
liabilities 
for 

corporations 
and 
has 
notably 

withdrawn from the Paris climate 

agreement. 
Nevertheless, 
more 

people are becoming knowledgeable 

about 
the 
incompetencies 
in 

U.S. environmental and health 

policies 
and 
are 
demanding 

more from their elected officials. 

Some of these proposed solutions 

include 
establishing 
Medicare 

for All, enforcing more stringent 

regulations for air and water purity, 

relocation of landfills and increased 

access to COVID-19 testing facilities 

for low-income individuals. 

When 
outlining 
populations 

especially vulnerable to COVID-

19, 
it 
is 
imperative 
that 
we 

apply a conscious, critical and 

intersectional lens that considers 

populations in the context of social 

dynamics and systems of power. 

By doing so, we can begin to more 

correctly 
project 
COVID-19’s 

impacts and develop a plan of action 

to keep vulnerable populations safe, 

healthy and alive.

NA’KIA CHANNEY

Former MiC Co-Managing Editor

In these times of uncertainty 

and social distancing, it can be 

really easy for us to justify habits 

that aren’t always conducive to 

our mental health—spending days 

lazing on the couch, staying inside 

all day, binge-watching Tiger King 

on Netflix (this I’m totally guilty 

of). While some laziness and being 

stagnant can definitely be justified 

as therapeutic, acting in self-care 

and self-love is essential during 

these stressful times.

Here are a couple of activities 

you can do to soothe your mind, 

body and soul during these stressful 

times:

1) Listen to yourself: Let your 

inner voice be your guide and tell 

you which self-care ritual you need 

to act on. If you have high energy, 

take on a task you’ve been ignoring 

for a long time, like organizing your 

closet or going through your camera 

roll. If you’re tired and want to relax, 

allow yourself that! Take a nap, 

listen to music, look at airline prices 

and imagine all the trips you’d 

hypothetically take if we weren’t in 

the middle of a pandemic, etc.

2) Journal: Journaling is one 

of the most effective ways you can 

keep track of your wellbeing, and is 

a great way to just take some time 

away and focus on yourself and your 

thoughts. It can act as a great source 

for self-reflection or even a cathartic 

way to dump all of your feelings 

into a single place. Start each entry 

by making a list of all of the things 

you’re grateful for.

3) Write letters to your loved 

ones: Honestly, I’m using this 

quarantine to become my idealized 

self: a Jane Austen protagonist. 

There’s just something really nice 

about opening a letter from someone, 

and knowing that they took time 

out of their day to handwrite and 

address a letter to you. You could 

send each other printed out memes, 

polaroids, 
pictures, 
even 
little 

presents to one another. 

4) Go out for a walk: A lot of us 

might not realize it, but we walk a lot 

when we’re on campus. From classes 

to on-campus jobs to org meetings to 

events, it’s hard to go from clocking 

in at almost 10k steps a day and 

then barely hitting 500 when you’re 

sitting at home. Going on a daily 

walk around in your neighborhood 

or at a local park can 

be a helpful way to 

just take a breath 

and, as my Lebanese 

mother says, kahli el 

shams shouf wijak 

(translation: let the 

sun see your face).

5) Pick up a new 

hobby! Have you 

ever thought “Man, 

I would love to learn 

how to do X/Y/Z, 

but I just don’t have 

the time” — well, 

quarantine 
is 
the 

perfect time to learn! 

Start a garden, learn 

how to sew your own clothes, write 

poetry, get really good at winged 

eyeliner, start a blog, make jewelry, 

play video games: The possibilities 

are pretty much endless. We’re all 

ignoring the constant rush of canvas 

notifications anyways, might as well 

learn a new skill while doing so.

hile all the arenas 

of 
our

have 
undergone 

tremendous change in these last 

few weeks as many

it’s imperative that

on 

the

While

mental 
illness, 
isolation 

can be particularly lonely and 

damaging as many of us have 

established new identities and 

support systems away from 

home. 

It’s 
easy 
to 
sink 
into 

depressive episodes or feel 

unsupported in isolation as 

the 
quick 
departure 
from 

campus and a lack of stability 

in educational routines has 

left 
many 
without 
closure. 

While sitting in bed all day and 

watching lectures or streaming 

services seems to be the new 

norm, it’s important to ensure 

those in your support system 

and friend groups are still 

connected 
and 
functioning. 

Many 
of 
the 
symptoms 

associated with depression and 

depressive episodes consist of 

feelings of hopelessness, loss of 

interest in activities, irregular 

eating patterns and persistence 

of empty moods, all of which can 

be compounded by the current 

pandemic and isolation. All of 

these feelings and symptoms 

are all too familiar for LGBTQ+ 

individuals, 80 percent of whom 

reported feelings of depression 

in the last week.

Only one in four LGBTQ+ 

youth identify having families 

that support them at home, while 

78 percent cited not being out 

to their families due to negative 

comments surrounding their 

identities. In a quarantined 

environment, 
LGBTQ+ 

individuals will likely find 

unsupportive family systems 

that can exacerbate feelings 

of 
isolation 
and 
loneliness. 

Many 
in 
our 
community 

find 
alternative 

homes 
when 
they 

move out for the 

first time and can 

pursue new avenues 

to 
express 
their 

identity. 
Coming 

home 
to 
histories 

of 
unsupportive 

communities 
or 

family systems can be 

extremely 
difficult 

for LGBTQ+ individuals, and 

we rely on those in our support 

systems, 
schools 
or 
social 

circles to uplift us in times of 

isolation and discrimination. 

The presence of depression 

and 
mental 
illness 
in 
the 

LGBTQ+ 
community 
is 
all 

too common due to stigma 

and discrimination, in both 

youth and adult individuals. 

31.5 percent of LGBTQ+ youth 

cited being so hopeless or sad 

they had stopped doing their 

usual activities, which can 

translate into our current day-

to-day uncertainties about the 

COVID-19 
pandemic. 
With 

higher rates of mental illness, 

suicide 
and 
homelessness 

than the general population, 

the LGBTQ+ community is 

uniquely at risk in times of 

separation like these. Further, 

the LGBTQ+ community is far 

too familiar with stigmatization 

and isolation in public health 

emergencies — as we saw in the 

HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Throughout 
the 
HIV/

AIDS epidemic, the federal 

government 
largely 
ignored 

the 
LGBTQ+ 
community, 

resulting 
in 
massive 
losses 

and distrust in many of the 

institutions 
intended 
to 

protect those at risk. With 

an abysmal past in epidemic 

conditions, 
coupled 
with 

the current administration’s 

war on LGBTQ+ rights, the 

community can tend to feel lost 

and reluctant to reach out for 

support from institutions and 

support groups.

In response to struggles at 

home and stigmas surrounding 

our identities, many LGBTQ+ 

individuals move to create 

“chosen families.” The “chosen 

family” stems from ballroom 

culture in New York City but 

has taken on a new form for 

many 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals. 

A chosen family serves as a 

support system separate from 

the biological family or home. 

Many 
LGBTQ+-identifying 

individuals 
find 
themselves 

creating a family in college 

when they are away and able 

to build a system that supports 

them and allows them to 

explore their identities in a 

loving 
environment. 
These 

chosen 
families 
stand 
in 

for 
the 
reinforcement 
and 

direction that many lack at 

home but, with online courses 

and mandates to return home, 

many have found themselves 

separated from their families. 

Many LGBTQ+ individuals 

rely on their support systems 

and chosen families for support 

in times of uncertainty, so reach 

out to your LGBTQ+ friends and 

family. With so many symptoms 

masking themselves in status-

quo quarantine behavior, go out 

of your way to FaceTime and 

check in with your friends who 

might not have support systems 

outside of those at school or 

in their chosen communities. 

The 
same 
goes 
for 
other 

at-risk 
communities 
and 

those without the resources 

necessary to maintain a healthy 

mindset in times of chaos and 

uncertainty. It is imperative we 

support our LGBTQ+ family, 

especially as we find ourselves 

in uncomfortable environments 

without the institutional or 

societal support that those with 

mainstream identities benefit 

T

he views at the top were 

certainly beautiful — the blue 

of Lake Michigan stretching 

out 
forever. 
However, 
nothing 

compared to what was at the bottom 

of the hill, which took my breath away. 

Windows shattered, paint peeling, roof 

caving in, doors flung open to rooms 

with mattresses torn apart and water 

dripping. I was looking at what used 

to be the most popular ski destination 

in the Midwest — Sugarloaf Mountain. 

When the resort was at its prime it 

attracted up to 4,000 skiers a day. This 

past Wednesday, 20 years after its 

closure, I was the only one there. 

Within the resort, the atmosphere 

only became more apocalyptic. It felt 

like an ideal setting for a horror movie. 

There was one picture hanging on the 

wall that hadn’t been broken. The date 

on the bottom of the frame read 1972. 

The picture was of what looked like 

an après-ski party — the outdoor patio 

crowded with people in multicolored 

retro snowsuits, laughing and holding 

drinks. I then looked out at what was 

left of the back patio, all of the chairs 

broken and the wood deck rotting. It 

felt surreal to see the photo of how 

vibrant this place used to be and 

compare that to the lifeless scene in 

front of me. 

The eeriness of this abandoned 

resort gave me the same chills I felt 

scrolling through photos by The New 

York Times of deserted places around 

the world during this pandemic. The 

photos included the Eiffel Tower, 

Times Square, the streets of Rome and 

the Sydney Opera House — emptiness 

spreading globally like the virus. This 

is a virus that does not recognize 

borders. Across the world, the most 

popular destinations are completely 

abandoned. There are public spaces, 

places built for humans, but no 

humans. 

The 
desolation 
is 
evident 
on 

campus. On March 10, I was weaving 

around other students, trying to make 

it on time to my morning lecture. Two 

weeks later, the only signs of life on 

the Diag are the squirrels fighting 

over nuts, a sight all too reminiscent 

of the shoppers I witnessed at Meijer 

bickering over the last rolls of toilet 

paper. Our lives changed abruptly 

with no indication of when things will 

get better.

COVID-19 
has 
rightfully 
been 

the only thing in the news recently. 

I’ve heard “stay six feet apart” and 

“wash your hands” hundreds of times. 

We are reshaping our lives around 

this virus. It feels as though this 

is only the beginning of a timeless, 

emotional, medical pandemic and 

financial recession. 

We 
are 
currently 
a 
part 
of 

something that will be known as an 

infamous historical event. Twenty 

years from now, previously lively 

spaces like Sugarloaf in the 1970s, 

could look very different. As a result 

of the coronavirus, jobs will be lost, 

businesses will close, buildings will 

be boarded up and places will be 

abandoned. 

The eeriness of abandonment is 

already evident in airports, national 

parks, subways, wedding venues, 

concert 
halls, 
schools, 
churches, 

travel destinations, stadiums, etc. 

What is the cost of these places being 

closed? The source of income that 

previously circulated through these 

places is all of a sudden inaccessible, 

cooped up in their homes under 

“shelter in place” orders. 

Realistically, if businesses cannot 

innovate and reinvent themselves 

virtually many may not survive. 

Wuhan, China, where the virus first 

emerged, has been in lockdown for 

almost two months. Many businesses 

in the United States could have to 

endure two months without income. 

It is hard to believe that the economy 

is “going to all bounce back and it’s 

going to bounce back very big,” as 

President 
Donald 
Trump 
claims, 

when so many people are risking 

unemployment.

Within this pandemic we can still 

find hope. The emptiness around the 

world does not instill eeriness alone. 

There are hints of aspiration and 

realization. Aspirations for things 

we often took for granted, like social 

connection. When you are restricted 

to FaceTime, the value of in-person 

conversation becomes evident. There 

is also a realization that places are 

only worth the people in them. Many 

of the currently abandoned spaces 

around the world have beauty in 

themselves, but the actual beauty is 

the presence of others within these 

spaces.

For right now we can empathize, 

accept and look ahead. Empathize 

with those most vulnerable during 

this pandemic, accept that things are 

not going to be normal and look ahead 

to when places will be full of people, 

instead of abandoned.

This week, Nine Inch Nails posted the following 

message on its website:

AS THE NEWS SEEMS TO TURN EVER 

MORE GRIM BY THE HOUR, WE’VE FOUND 

OURSELVES 
VACILLATING 
WILDLY 

BETWEEN FEELING LIKE THERE MAY 

BE HOPE AT TIMES TO UTTER DESPAIR — 

OFTEN CHANGING MINUTE TO MINUTE 

… MUSIC — WHETHER LISTENING TO IT, 

THINKING ABOUT IT OR CREATING IT — HAS 

ALWAYS BEEN THE THING THAT HELPED 

US GET THROUGH ANYTHING — GOOD OR 

BAD. WITH THAT IN MIND, WE DECIDED TO 

BURN THE MIDNIGHT OIL AND COMPLETE 

THESE NEW GHOSTS RECORDS AS A MEANS 

OF STAYING SOMEWHAT SANE.

As I admitted to a friend on the phone later 

that day, getting out of bed and discovering the 

release of new Nine Inch Nails material is one of 

the best things I could have possibly woken up to 

at this strange, isolated point in my life. What’s 

more is that these two new albums aren’t exactly 

standalones. They are sequels to Ghosts I-IV, an 

ambient instrumental album that recently turned 

12 years old and marks a fascinating turning point 

in the band’s career. 

Ghosts I-IV is something of a toy box for Trent 

Reznor’s most introspective musical ideas. In 

stepping away from the realm of industrial rock, 

the frontman demonstrated the haunting power 

of his compositional abilities. In fact, a few tracks 

from the album went on to score what I consider 

the greatest movie of the 2010s. Reznor and Ross 

would hardly pause from writing film and TV 

scores after Ghosts I-IV. One piece, “34 Ghosts IV,” 

was sampled by Lil Nas X to become Billboard’s 

longest running No. 1 song, ultimately winning 

Reznor his first (and likely last) Country Music 

Award. 

With all that said, while Ghosts V: Together 

and Ghosts VI: Locusts lack the gritty, combustive 

charm of their oddly imposing predecessor, they 

are mature and deeply affecting additions to the 

Nine Inch Nails canon. Both albums sacrifice 

that distinct, thrummy intensity of previous NIN 

records, trading this quality in for a focus on an 

all-consuming atmosphere. And yet, the albums 

could not differ more in tone. 

Ghosts V: Together is a warm yet unsettling 

hug. The best way to listen to the album is with 

your eyes closed and your head down, allowing 

Reznor’s bouts of ethereal humming dissonance 

to fill your mind. Like the best NIN records, 

Together weaves through slow and rewarding 

apexes with intensity, drawing one in completely 

before unleashing the naked core of its ideas. Both 

“Letting Go While Holding On” and the title track 

achieve this gradual release expertly.

There is no shortage of what I call the “NIN 

chord” here, (a major third on top of a flat seventh, 

if you’re dying to know), a conflicting set of notes 

that thrive in the band’s typically ambiguous 

emotional settings. If 

you’ve listened to some 

NIN, 
you 
probably 

know what these notes 

evoke — a reluctant, 

fleeting smile. 

Reznor appears to 

cite composer Vangelis 

(“Blade 
Runner”) 

with the patient depth 

of tones; each layer 

of sound feels both 

vividly 
human 
and 

distantly digital at the 

same time. This is a theme that Together relishes 

in, most notably on “Your Touch.” Despite the 

tactile impressions of the track’s title, its melodies 

are wispy, warped electronic phrases. It made 

me consider what human connection often feels 

like in a global pandemic: faces as grainy laptop 

camera images, voices as feeble phone speaker 

audio, conversation as iMessage notifications. 

If Together in an album that exists outside of 

time — bleary, pulsating and digital — then Locusts 

is a panicking, frazzled human heart crushed by 

urgency. 

Look no further than its opening track, “The 

Cursed Clock,” to understand how drastically 

morbid everything becomes. Cool vibrating 

synths are replaced with a piano and strange 

whirring. The minimalist uniformity of the notes 

would make John Carpenter proud: If one were 

to insert them into a “Halloween” movie, I don’t 

think anyone would question it.

Here, musical ideas are no longer nine-minute 

waves of sweet kinetic force — they are indecent 

little trios of short notes that attack like hornets. 

It’s no secret that NIN writes dark music, but never 

before has it been so overtly present in the band’s 

musical direction. NIN often coats its bleakness 

in grimy headbangability, but Locusts takes a far 

blunter approach to the abyss. Moreover, not since 

2002’s Still has NIN tried to feel so intimate. The 

rendition of “Something I Can Never Have” on that 

record makes it sound as though Reznor’s voice is 

echoing in a tiny room. 

That effect is attempted 

here, though without 

vocals we merely hear 

the pianist’s rustling 

and breathing.

Locusts 
continues 

with many of these 

same 
components, 

sinking deeper into its 

listener with unbending 

claws. Aside from its 

ambient backgrounds, 

most 
elements 
of 

Locusts are organic; Reznor brings out some brass 

on top of the piano, delving further into the bumpy 

noir style he employed on the “Watchmen” score. 

The newest installment of the Ghosts series 

certainly breaks new ground. But the question 

of where it will take Nine Inch Nails is an open 

one. Trent Reznor is so utterly capable of musical 

excellence that the question isn’t a matter of if, but 

how. Is this full-throated evil going to remain a part 

of the band’s songwriting? I’m curious to see how 

that would play with its more digestible material.

The thesis of Nine Inch Nails is something like, 

“The world is a void and nothing matters, but it’s 

OK to feel that way.” I’m guessing that sentiment 

is not an unpopular one right now. Together and 

Locusts managed to amplify all the feelings I had 

about living inside all day while the world seems 

to have halted. By embracing the tenet that made 

them who they are, NIN did us all a favor by 

expediting this release.

ALBUM REVIEW

This is it. A little over a year since Netflix 

pulled the plug on the critically-acclaimed Latinx-

centered family sitcom, “One Day at a Time,” and 

after numerous fan campaigns and a last minute 

save by POP TV, the show has finally returned 

to our screens. Regardless of whether you’ve 

watched the series from the beginning — either 

the 
1975 
original 

created by Norman 

Lear or the reboot 

in 2017 — or are only 

discovering it for the 

first time, the premiere 

is very aware of its 

need to appeal to both 

audiences. Becoming 

the first ever show to 

be saved by a linear 

television 
network 

from 
a 
streaming 

platform, the Cuban-

American 
Alvarez 

family has no problem sticking it to their old 

platform with the son Alex (Marcel Ruiz, 

“Breakthrough”) declaring, “there’s nothing good 

on Netflix anymore.” 

The premiere focuses on reintroducing us to 

the Alvarez family, who have all changed over 

the course of the last three seasons, while still 

retaining their most beloved qualities. Penelope 

(Justina Machado, “Jane the Virgin”) is still a hard-

loving single mother, now a nurse practitioner. 

That doesn’t stop her mother, Lydia (Rita Moreno, 

“West Side Story”), from trying to retain her status 

as the matriarch of the household. Elena (Isabella 

Gomez, “Big Hero 6: The Series”) remains an 

overachieving, lovable and preachy high school 

dork. Alex is a cool teenager (seriously, that’s 

all there is to him), while Dr. Leslie Berkowitz 

(Stephen Tobolowsky, “Silicon Valley”) and the 

Alvarezes’ landlord Schneider (Todd Grinnell, 

“Grace and Frankie”) are the opposite of that and 

are the essential not-

blood-related overstay-

their-welcome 
family 

members.

With 
the 
show’s 

transition 
from 
a 

streaming 
service 
to 

cable channel, episodes 

are shorter, as they must 

fit within the 21-minute 

window. Unfortunately, 

that meant cutting the 

addictively catchy theme 

song down to a simple 

title card. Aside from 

that, “One Day” maintains its balance of socially 

conscious storylines with family comedy, like 

when Ray Romano (“The Big Sick”) had a cameo 

role as a census taker. Penelope slams the door 

in his face while Elena stresses the importance 

of participating in the census, highlighting the 

generational gap. Or Penelope grappling with 

the fact that being a single “badass feminist” and 

wanting to be in a relationship because you’re 

feeling alone aren’t always mutually exclusive. It’s 

also not always subtle in its messages — like when 

Romano reminds the Alvarezes that the census 

does not ask about citizenship. It’s these kinds of 

conversations that make the Alvarezes uniquely 

Latino and entirely American.

It’ll be interesting to see how the rest of the 

season unfolds, given that its move to cable also 

means episodes will be released on a weekly basis, 

rather than all at once. This makes the show feel 

too structured at times, as a certain amount of 

the plot must be accomplished within a specific 

amount of time before the commercial break. 

One of the things that drew me to “One Day” 

initially was how it differed from most multi-

camera sitcoms in that the episodes were a little 

longer, and how it perfectly balanced season-long 

arcs with episodic storylines. While I wouldn’t 

expect the latter to change, the shortened episode 

run times give the impression that the writers 

are racing against the clock to fit into unnatural 

feeling act breaks. This could simply be due to fans 

of the show having to get used to the new format. 

One thing that was obvious, however, was the lack 

of balancing plotlines outside of Penelope’s. Still, 

it’s safe to say that the humor and heart of “One 

Day at a Time” has been captured. 

With the coronavirus pandemic halting 

production on several television shows, who 

knows how many more episodes we’ll get. Even if 

there are some elements that we’ll miss — like the 

slightly longer episodes — it’s better than no new 

episodes at all. All I have to say is thank you to POP 

TV for taking a chance on a show I will excitedly 

tune in to every week.

An ode to Michigan wolverines

PHOTO ESSAY

“Can you edit a photo of 

the Big House empty?”

As a photo editor, that’s 

not a normal question to get 

asked. A picture of a Maize 

out at Yost? Sure, we have 

that. Protests on the Diag? 

Of course. But an empty 

stadium, let alone the Big 

House? Well that just isn’t 

in the job description.

I spent all night looking 

through the archives of 

Daily photos trying to find 

one, but the task was nearly 

impossible. Thousands and 

thousands of photos, yet 

not a single one of an empty 

Big House. Every photo was 

saturated with life. With 

maize and blue crowds, 

rally 
towels, 
sunglasses, 

posters, etc. From Crisler to 

Yost to the Big House, all I 

could find was pictures of 

beaming students, proud to 

be a Michigan Wolverine.

Stadiums should be full of 

an obnoxiously loud student 

section and a marching 

band that plays the Victors 

Song three times in a row 

but it never getting old. Fists 

should be punching through 

the air as the crowd dances 

to the Blues Brothers song 

during the final period of 

each game. Mr. Brightside 

should be blasting through 

the speakers as students 

jump through the bleachers, 

not knowing the Killers 

would retweet this ordinary 

rite. 
Traditions 
show 

these stadiums should be 

anything but empty. 

It’s 
not 
just 
the 

stadiums. It’s the theaters 

too. 
The 
restaurants. 

The 
auditoriums. 
The 

classrooms. 
It’s 
working 

hard at rehearsal every night 

just to see a performance 

get 
cancelled. 
Spending 

hours in the UGLI on a 

presentation just to deliver 

it via a computer screen. 

Dedicating every day of the 

semester to the Daily and 

the newsroom just to see 

the paper not get printed. 

It’s a lot of heartbreaking 

disappointment. But this 

disappointment 
doesn’t 

take away from the hard 

work, the late nights or the 

dedication.

Here we are, spending 

what may be our final days 

of the semester and school 

year on an almost empty 

campus. In the midst of this 

chaos, a lot of us have taken 

the time to reflect back on 

the year, scanning through 

old photos and posting them 

to Instagram or Facebook. 

It’s devastating to see it 

come to this abrupt halt 

as some say their final 

goodbyes. 
As 
someone 

who works every day to 

capture these moments on 

campus, I decided to try and 

summarize this past year 

via photos. I know it’s not 

quite the closure we were 

all hoping to get out of this 

year, but I’m hoping it will 

serve for something.

So Wolverines, through 

the lens of my camera 

and that of several Daily 

photographers, 
I 
invite 

you to take a look back at 

this past year. Full of joy, 

tears and lots of late nights. 

COVID-19 may have cut 

our time short, but let’s not 

forget how lucky we are to 

be a Michigan Wolverine. 

Let’s begin with one of 

Michigan’s obvious pride 

and 
joys: 
sports. 
Those 

warm 
summer 
Saturday 

afternoons spent in the 

Big House or cold winter 

walks to Crisler are some 

of 
everyone’s 
fondest 

memories. 
From 
beating 

Notre Dame in the pouring 

rain to snagging the Paul 

Bunyan Trophy, yet again, 

it was an exciting season 

for football (that is, up until 

November 30th, but we 

won’t talk about that). 

ALLISON ENGKVIST

Managing Photo Editor

We 
watched 
a 
new 

basketball team take the 

court and kick off the season 

by winning the Battle 4 

Atlantis tournament. Yes, 

the season had its ups and 

downs, but don’t let that take 

away from the highlights. 

We beat Michigan State 

in Crisler and witnessed 

Juwan 
Howard’s 
first 

season as head coach. 

And of course, Michigan 

Hockey 
had 
a 
strong 

season as well. We made 

it to the semifinals in the 

Big Ten Tournament and 

who 
knows, 
maybe 
we 

would have won. It’s also 

worth noting that we beat 

Michigan State in football, 

basketball 
and 
hockey 

this 
year...something 
to 

definitely remember.

Beyond sports, we were 

fortunate to have some 

interesting speakers visit 

campus. Politics aside, it’s 

always unique to have the 

opportunity to listen to 

some of these speakers. How 

many other universities had 

Bernie Sanders on their diag 

or Hillary Clinton in their 

auditorium? Ann Arbor and 

Detroit are big campaign 

stops for the presidential 

candidates, meaning we get 

to see everything up close. 

Plus, next fall Crisler won’t 

just be for basketball or 

gymnastics--we get to host 

the final presidential debate 

next fall. 

The year was also full 

of 
protests 
and 
rallies. 

From passionate students 

projecting their ideas across 

the Diag to hanging posters 

up in the Union opening, 

people’s voices were heard.

After months of waiting, 

we finally got the Union 

back! Even though it didn’t 

come with the promised 

Panda Express or Taco Bell, 

that’s something to look 

forward to next year. The 

LSA building also had a nice 

renovation and turned into 

a great study spot. And of 

course, Reggie was there to 

bless it during its opening. 

And finally, here are some 

of our favorite spots in Ann 

Arbor. We welcomed Joe’s 

Pizza to its first location 

outside of NYC and have 

worshipped it since. From 

walking through the arb 

to getting a sandwich from 

Zingerman’s, there’s a place 

for everyone in Ann Arbor.

It’s easy to feel empty 

during 
this 
time 
of 

crisis. 
Walking 
around 

campus and seeing empty 

restaurants, 
stores 
and 

libraries. 
Not 
having 
a 

graduation or getting to 

see our best friends once 

more 
before 
next 
fall. 

Our 
traditional 
sense 

of community has been 

completely 
compromised. 

But in these past few weeks, 

I think we’ve created a new 

kind of community. The 

encouragement 
and 
aid 

I’ve seen students offer one 

another is truly incredible. 

People have offered beds 

in their houses, food, cars, 

etc. in a mutual aid sheet 

to ensure that everyone 

is 
safe 
and 
healthy. 

Professors, 
advisors 
and 

peers have reached out 

and offered a shoulder to 

lean on for anyone who 

needs. 
Restaurants 
have 

provided free meals and the 

Maize and Blue Cupboard 

continues to provide food 

for those who need it. 

I’ve seen everyone come 

together to lend a hand and 

that shouldn’t go unnoticed.

Yes, it’s heartbreaking 

not being able to see the 

semester come to the close 

that 
we 
all 
envisioned. 

There’s no bandaid to heal 

that. But seeing this support 

network from my fellow 

classmates, that has to make 

up 
for 
something. 
This 

experience has united us all 

and reminds us how lucky 

we are to be a Wolverine.
