SAN ANTONIO, Texas — Down 10 with 

14 minutes to go, John Beilein scooped his 
jawline and paced the sidelines with his 
head down, overlooking his bench. What 
happened to his team?

He knew not to take No. 11-seeded Loyola-

Chicago lightly. In his eyes, the Ramblers 
weren’t a Cinderella anymore after they made 
it to the Sweet Sixteen two weeks ago. But his 
Wolverines? After all they’d been through, they 
weren’t supposed to be down double-digits, 
struggling to buy a bucket in the Final Four.

“We’re not like that where we can go and 

just school anybody,” Beilein said. “We’ve got 
really good players, don’t get me wrong, but 
every team that’s playing right now is playing 
because they play great defense.”

It wasn’t until eight minutes later that 

Moritz Wagner converted a putback and-one 
and flexed his muscles towards his bench 
that Beilein griped at. What happened to 
his team? Wagner’s and-one — three of 
his 24 total points, and one of his 15 total 
rebounds — was the nightcap to a 17-2 run 
and a 53-47 lead. It was as good of a spurt 
as they’ve had all year. That is what a 
Beilein-led, March team looks like.

It’s a resiliency that found its footing 

and persisted. Michigan (33-7 overall) 
willed its way over Loyola (32-6) in front 
of nearly 70,000 people at the Alamodome, 
69-57. What once seemed an impossibility is 
now reality — the Wolverines are playing in 
the National Championship against Villanova 
on Monday.

The high stakes of the contest — and the 

nerves coupled with it — were evident from the 
get-go. By the under-eight media timeout in the 
first half, sophomore point guard Zavier Simpson, 
who has a 2.69 assist-turnover ratio, coughed it up 
three times without scoring. Abdur-Rahkman — 
who finished 2-for-11 — also felt the pressure, forcing 
up seven errant, unfruitful attempts in the first half. 
Their efforts headlined one of the Wolverines worst 
first half outputs of the season.

“We had eight turnovers in the first half. We were 

one (assist) and eight,” Beilein said. “I don’t think 
you’ve ever seen one of our teams ever be one assist to 
eight turnovers. … We had to adjust to how quickly they 
were rotating to some of our action, because they were 
switching so much.”

Wagner and redshirt sophomore Charles Matthews 

were the lone Wolverines to impress in the first 20 minutes. 
Wagner was nearly unstoppable on the boards, collecting a 
double-double at the 3:08 mark of the first frame. Matthews’ 
eight points and four rebounds also made up for an otherwise-
abysmal 9-for-31 first-half display by Michigan.

The Ramblers were able to capitalize marginally through 

center Cameron Krutwig, who met Wagner in kind. Krutwig 
bullied his way for eight of his 17 total points in the paint in 
the first half.

His performance highlighted the Ramblers’ quiet 

10-for-24 first-half shooting performance from the 
field, as well as 9-for-10 from the free throw line. The 
defensive dogfight, a 29-22 halftime advantage for 
Loyola, was a snoozer with a Final Four sticker 
slapped on top of it.

“I knew they were trying to punch us,” 

Wagner said. “First of all, you’ve got to give 
them a lot of credit; their set plays are 

incredible. Tough to guard. And their big 
man does an incredible job down there as a 
freshman. So we had to cover that somehow 
defensively.

“And I tried to do my job, tried not to foul 

and stay solid, build walls and grab rebounds. 
And it worked out.”

The second half began as a mirror opposite 

to the previous half. Michigan and Loyola 
exchanged baskets, with the Wolverines unable 
to carve into the deficit. 

Then Wagner went to work. He continued his 

impressive play with a dunk to open Michigan’s 
scoring and two steals from telegraphed passes that 
led to baskets. But this time, Wagner was no longer 
the only life raft in the Wolverines’ 17-2 run.

Fifth-year senior point guard Jaaron Simmons hit 

a corner trey — his first since the first round matchup 
against Iowa in the Big Ten Tournament. Then 
freshman guard Jordan Poole, who played just two 
minutes against Florida State in the Elite Eight, drove 
to the hoop for an unexpected two points. Fifth-year 
senior forward Duncan Robinson followed with 
a long 3-pointer. The Wolverines were down just 
three points with building momentum.

“I just knew it, it had that feeling,” Abdur-

Rahkman said. “One of these times down we 
were gonna get a stop, turn it into offense and 
keep going and going. We just needed that spark 
plug.”

And the run that Michigan needed so 

badly became legitimate. Down 47-44 with 
6:05 remaining, Wagner calmly corralled a 
low-post pass, dribbled to the corner and 
knocked down a triple.

Tie game.
Wagner’s villainy wasn’t finished, of 

course. He had his and-one putback and 
his flex — an exclamation point on the 
best game of his life.

“I mean, 24 and 15 — If I need to 

explain anything more than that, it’s a 
problem,” Simpson said. “That’s what 
a leader does.”

A poster reading “Bye Bye Sista” 

— a dig at Loyola’s team chaplain 
and media sensation, Sister Jean 
— flashed to the camera. The 
Wolverines’ stout defense made 
sure it really was goodbye.

“They did what great 

teams do,” said Ramblers 
coach Porter Moser. “They 
capitalized on that run where 
we made six turnovers in a 
row.”

It was enough to put 

Cinderella — or whoever they 
are, if you’re Beilein — to 
bed and secure a spot in the 
championship.

Maybe you could go back to 

March 17 and credit Poole’s 
buzzer-beater against Houston 
to Michigan’s success. But 
when the Wolverines had to 
show up, they did. It’s equally 
plausible that they were meant 
to be here the whole time.

“I feel like we’ve kinda 

controlled the games we’ve 
played in,” Robinson said. “I 
don’t think it’s an accident that 
we’re here. We’re playing well at 
the right time.”

But it doesn’t matter how it 

happened — they made it to the 
biggest stage in college basketball. You 
don’t get there with just luck.

MomentUM appeals Central Student Judiciary 
Decision, delays certification of election results

ANDREW HIYAMA 
Daily News Editor

Incoming Central Student 
Government 
representatives 
may not be able to officially 
gather until a week or more 
after 
their 
intended 
first 
meeting April 3 due to pending 
election 
litigation 
that 
prevents the certification of 
election results.
The 
case 
in 
question 
is 
MVision’s 
allegations 
against 
Engineering 
junior 
Michael Nwansi, the elected 
MomentUM 
Engineering 
representative. 
MVision 
reportedly 
observed 
and 
photographed 
Nwansi 
influencing a student while 
voting in the CSG election, 
a violation of CSG’s election 

code.
In a written decision dated 
March 
28, 
the 
University 
Elections 
Commission 
ruled 
against 
Nwansi 
and 
MomentUM, 
issuing 
Nwansi four demerits and 
the MomentUM party one 
demerit, reducing Nwansi’s 
vote count by 12 percent and 
MomentUM’s vote count by 
three percent. According to 
CSG Election Director Brian 
Koziara, a law student, the 
demerits would cost Nwansi 
the seat he won, though the 
runner-up is also a member 
of MomentUM. Koziara said 
the one demerit issued to 
MomentUM would not affect 
any other representatives.
MomentUM 
is 
now 
appealing the decision to the 
Central 
Student 
Judiciary 

on the grounds that the UEC 
issued its decision outside 
the 
36-hour 
time 
frame 
following a hearing. Koziara 
said MomentUM argued the 
36 hours should have begun 
at 9:15 p.m. on March 26, after 
the UEC heard MVision vs. 
Nwansi. But Koziara argued 
the 36 hours began at 1:00 a.m. 
on March 27, after all cases 
had been heard. MomentUM 
is also challenging the UEC’s 
issuance 
of 
a 
preliminary 
order ahead of a full opinion, 
which Koziara said they had 
to do because they also had to 
rule on a number of “frivolous” 
cases.
“MomentUM was one of the 
parties that brought a lot of 
cases right before the deadline, 
so it’s funny that they’re 
complaining that we didn’t 
get them their full opinion 
within 36 hours when all 
of their complaints that 
they brought were part 
of the reason we were so 
swamped 
with 
work,” 
Koziara said.
In an email to several 
members of the current 
CSG 
executive 
board, 
Koziara 
emphasized 
MomentUM was “free to 
withdraw their appeal at 
any time,” which would 
allow the UEC to certify 
election 
results 
and 
expedite 
the 
transition 
process for the next CSG 
assembly.
Law student Tom Allen, 
who is serving as counsel 
to MVision, said because 
the case has been appealed 
to the CSJ, MVision no 
longer had the option to 
drop the case themselves.
“Although we definitely 
stand 
by 
the 
decision, 
just in terms of getting 
the assembly in as soon 
as possible is of a much 
higher interest to us than 

really any case,” Allen said. 
“But the ability to drop has 
been taken out of our hands, 
and at this point the election 
director is defending his own 
decision.”
Representatives 
of 
MomentUM 
declined 
to 
provide comment before the 
case was resolved.
Incoming 
CSG 
President 
Daniel 
Greene, 
a 
Public 
Policy junior and member 
of MVision, said while he 
respected MomentUM’s and 
Nwansi’s right to due process, 
he was concerned about the 
consequences of not being able 
to convene the new assembly 
until April 10 or later.
“It’s now a weird –– I don’t 
want to say unprecedented, 
but an abnormal situation 
because the seventh assembly, 
or the individuals who served 
this past semester, were told 
that last Tuesday was their 
last meeting,” Greene said. 
“So what’s really happening 
is that this case pending will 
likely result in CSG not having 
quorum on Tuesday, rendering 
it ineffective and unable to 
take any actions.”
Greene 
said 
the 
appeal 
delays his official confirmation 
along with the nomination and 
confirmation of other CSG 
executives, meaning he can’t 
meaningfully reach out to 
student organizations.
“Unfortunately, the student 
buy-in 
and 
willingness 
to 
meet, considering upcoming 
finals, is different from just 
the candidate who won versus 
Central Student Government 
formally 
reaching 
out 
to 
student organizations, and I’d 
prefer to use CSG executive 
resources in terms of the 
listserv information and the 
contact people, which I can’t 
get until the official transition 
begins,” he said.

ON THE DAILY: WILD YET MILD 

In the immediate minutes after 
the Michigan men’s basketball team 
claimed its spot in the NCAA Cham-
pionship game after beating Loyola 
University Chicago Saturday night, 
hundreds of University of Michigan 
students and fans flooded the inter-
section of South University Avenue 
and Church Street to celebrate.
LSA junior Mikayla Easley was at 
Garage Bar watching the game with 
friends when the Wolverines won. 
After the game ended, she and her 
friends, along with many patrons of 
Garage Bar and other nearby bars, 
headed to the streets to celebrate.
“After we won, everybody at 
Garage Bar poured out of Garage 
and just into the streets, and every-
one from Rick’s was pouring out, 
Charley’s, Cantina was pouring out 
and just running to the center where 
Church (St.) is,” Easley said.
LSA sophomore Jack Finkel was 
headed to Pizza House on Church 
St. to celebrate after watching the 
game at home with his friends. He 

describes a scene of mass rejoic-
ing and unity as students and fans 
gathered to chant U-M sayings such 
as, “Who’s got it better than us?” and, 
“It’s great to be a Wolverine!”
“All the cars were honking, people 
were just running, people were 
screaming one thing or another,” 
Finkel said. “On the corner of South 
U. and Church, right under the street 
light, there must have been maybe 
300, 400 students chanting the usual 
chants.”
According to a Detroit News 
article, there were four arrests for 
disorderly conduct as well as a trash-
can and couch fire, which prompted 
the arrival of the Ann Arbor Fire 
Department. However, on-duty Ann 
Arbor Police officers said the couch 
fire was extinguished before the fire 
department arrived.
Despite the several arrests and 
brief fires, the Ann Arbor Police 
Department sent a tweet out around 
10:30 p.m. Saturday night thank-
ing the Ann Arbor community for 

celebrating responsibly.
Easley said the gathering was 
very orderly and after most of the 
fans had left the area, she saw people 
picking up trash from the streets.
“It was very much a celebrating 
thing — no one was angry at any-
body,” Easley said.
LSA sophomore Taylor King 
echoed Easley’s statements and 
described how proud she felt to be a 
Wolverine on Saturday night. King 
was present during the celebrations 
in the streets, but she said despite 
the excitement and moments of 
chaos, fans knew how to celebrate 
but remain in control at the same 
time.
“I was expecting people to be a lot 
crazier than they were,” King said. 
“Like I know people were climb-
ing light poles and other people’s 
shoulders, but compared to how 
other schools have done it, I think 
we did a pretty good job. We know 
how to rage, but not destroy the 
whole town.”


This is part three of a series 

showcasing 
underrepresented 

narratives within the Asian/
Pacific 
Islander-American 

community. Kai Mason is a 
junior majoring in English on a 
pre-law track. On campus, she 
is the president of the University 
of Michigan Slam Poetry and 
creative 
director 
of

The Michigan Daily: Tell me a 

little about your family history.

Mason: My mom and dad are 

both immigrants. My mom came 
here from Japan for graduate 
school. My dad came here from 
Jamaica when he was six. They 
met at a café.

I grew up with a really 

strong influence by my mom, 
who was a Japanese teach er at 
both American and Japanese 
schools. She really pressed our 
Japanese side on us, and we 
went to Japanese school every 
Saturday and school in Japan 
every summer. We didn’t really 
get a chance to learn about 
Jamaican culture from my dad. 
I still identify as both Black and 
Asian, though, because I was 
always the “other” wherever I 
was. I was very aware of the fact 
that I didn’t look like everyone 
else or live like everybody else. 
So I identify as both; I usually tell 
people that I’m half-Japanese 
and half-Jamaican.

TMD: 
How 
has 
your 

perception of your identity as an 
A/PIA shifted over the course of 
your life?

Mason: I grew up in very white 

environments, so until about 
first grade, I really believed I 
was white. In first grade, though, 
we were learning about Martin 
Luther King Jr. and someone 
said, “If it weren’t for MLK, 
Kai wouldn’t be here.” I was so 
confused, because even though I 
knew that I was a different color 
than everyone else, I didn’t think 

anyone else noticed. It was also 
around this time that whenever 
I went to Japan, people would 
ask me if I was 
(a 
Black 

person). I didn’t 
know what 

this word meant at the time, so I 
would say that I didn’t know.

In middle school, my school’s 

friend 
groups 
were 
very 

segregated by race. The white 
kids hung out with each other, 
and the Black kids hung out with 
each other. There weren’t many 
Asian kids, but the ones we had 
were absorbed into the white 
kids. I started feeling really 
conflicted about where to go — 
was I more Black, or more Asian? 
I ended up hanging out with 
white people, because that’s who 
I felt the most at home with.w

One day, I just had a random 

epiphany: I wasn’t more of one 
thing than another — I was 
both at the same time. I could 
create my identity, and I could be 
whatever I wanted to be. I was 
reading a lot of books by mixed 
authors at this time — my mom 
had this book called “Half and 
Half”, which was an anthology 
of short stories by mixed writers. 
I was also reading “The Color 
of Water”. I think this really 
helped me, because until then, 
I had never read anything by 
mixed people about being mixed. 
I didn’t know that other people 
could relate to my experiences.

TMD: 
Among 
these 

experiences of grappling with 
your identity, how have you 
found ways to celebrate who you 
are? 

Mason: I can get caught up in 

the social justice aspect of my 
identity sometimes, but it has 
been so cool to be able to live 
multiple cultures. Who gets all 
of the opportunities that I have? 
Who has my mom and my dad? 
That’s the first thing that people 
usually say, like, “Wow, that’s so 
cool,” and it is! It’s really easy to 
forget how fun it has been.

I’m also so thankful for how 

close these experiences have 
made me to my brother. He’s 
the person I can most closely 
identify with, since we grew up 
experiencing the same things 
in (and in-between) the same 
communities. We talk a lot about 
our identities, and I’m so glad to 

have him. If I were alone in this, 
it would be a lot tougher.

It’s also really cool how 

close you get with people who 
understand you. I’m so close 
with the mixed people in JSA 
(Japan Student Organization) 
because we get it. Yeah, I’m just 
really thankful for how cool life 
has been.

TMD: Earlier, you mentioned 

being asked about your identity 
in Japan. As you move about the 
world, how do you feel like other 
people might label you at first 
glance?

Mason: It really depends on 

the person — everyone but Black 
people think I’m just Black. 
They’re not wrong — I am Black, 
but I’m also Asian. They’re both 
huge parts of my identity that you 
can’t factor out, and I especially 
can never factor out. But I think a 
lot of Black people know that I’m 
mixed. They’re like, “Oh, are you 
mixed Asian?”

TMD: Do you think that has 

affected your relationship with 
the larger A/PIA community on 
campus?

Mason: I don’t really know, 

actually. I know that it has 
definitely affected the way that I 
perceive myself and others, but I 
don’t know if it really affects my 
relationship with the community 
because that’s always been my 
relationship with the community. 
It’s really exhausting, but I’m 
so used to Asian people being 
like, “Oh, why are you so good 
at Japanese?” Every time I meet 
a new Japanese person, I have 
to give them my whole life story, 
like, “So, I actually am Japanese.” 
I grew up speaking Japanese — 
it’s my first language — but every 
time I meet a new person, I have 
to explain myself.

I 
don’t 
think 
that 
has 

happened as much here as it 
does in Japan. The U.S. is a lot 
less homogeneous than Japan, so 
people understand more quickly 
and are more open to the idea 
of multiculturalism. In Japan, I 
could tell people my entire life 
story and they still could reply 
to me in English, because they 
cannot get over the fact that

lack of knowledge about my 
family, you could ask me to 
recite the preamble of the U.S. 
Constitution and I would chant 
it verbatim to the tune of a 
Schoolhouse Rock song.

When I was in first grade, my 

sister was the only third grader 
moved to tears during our school 
play while singing “This Land 
is My Land” to a montage of 
veterans’ homecomings. I knew 
then nobody loved this country 
as much as we, as immigrants, 
did.

Then we moved to Florida, 

and it was abundantly clearer to 
me this love was unrequited.

In second grade, my sister and 

I were on the bus to the YMCA 
after school when we were asked 
if we were Christian. When we 
replied that we were Muslim, 
my classmate conspiratorially 
informed us that we were going 
— here he paused dramatically, 
so I will too — “down there,” 
whispering and pointing to 
the ground like the fact that 
we were going to hell was the 
world’s most obvious truth.

In third grade, I was delighted 

to be in with the cool kids. The 
most popular boy in class even 
graced me with an inside joke. 
We would bond over our shared 
love of Harry Potter, and he 
would greet me with a, “Look 
out, she’s got an AK-47 in her 
pocket!” and a boisterous laugh. 
I had no idea what an AK-47 

was and at the time I only had 
the vaguest concept of 9/11, so 
I would giggle along with him, 
thinking nothing of it.

In fourth grade, a new girl 

joined our class, and from 
the second I saw her, we had 
a connection. I saw her tan 
skin like black tea in a sea of 
milk and I latched onto this 
girl whose darkness mirrored 
mine. We were delighted when 
people asked if we were twins, 
and it didn’t even occur to 
us this question was rooted 
in a racist veil that couldn’t 
distinguish 
between 
our 

different ethnicities, features 
and colorations and instead only 
saw “Brown.”

In fifth grade, I was on my 

way home from Egypt with my 
mom and my sister, running to 
get through customs to catch 
our connecting flight. At this 
point, I was unfazed by the 
disgusted gaze of onlookers as 
my mom frantically directed 
us in Arabic because I had 
experienced the same look in 
grocery stores as she walked 
silently, 
shoppers 
grimacing 

at the sight of her hijab alone. 
However, up until that point, I 
truly had more faith in authority 
figures. My mom walked up 
to one of the TSA agents in 
charge and made our case that 
we had less than an hour to get 
to our gate, asking if there was 
anything he could do — just as 
we had seen another family ask. 
He had given her an obvious 
onceover and promptly directed 
us to another line leading into 
a separate room. Our relief at 
the five-person line was short 
lived as we noticed that there 
was an obvious demographic 
in this alternate room of other 
Brown people in turbans and 
cultural identifiers. The TSA 
agent forcefully told my mother 
not to touch the bags, saying 
my scrawny sister and I could 
carry the bags from our month-
long trip onto a table almost as 

tall as I was. Our bag had been 
thoroughly 
examined, 
each 

article of clothing scrutinized 
and our souvenirs confiscated. 
We left the room later than 
people behind us in the first 
line, and my fifth-grade self 
felt naked, violated and close to 
tears.

I could go through every 

year of my life with a traumatic 
incident, 
concluding 
how 
I 

came to terms with racism and 
learned to not let it affect me. 
I could say I learned to laugh 
in the face of ignorance and 
racist people around me were 
rendered speechless by the 
American confidence that oozed 
red, white and blue with every 
step I took and word I spoke.

But that isn’t the truth. I was 

so scared of becoming the scary 
Arab-Muslim everyone feared 
that I lost myself, retreating 
into a shell of a person who hid 
her culture and religion and felt 
the constant need to reaffirm 
her Americanness, to prove her 
patriotism.

I’m here now to say that I am 

an angry Arab.

I’m angry my best friend 

in 
elementary 
school 

recommended a skin lightening 
cream to me, and I’m angry I 
begged my mom to buy it for me.

I’m angry I was so obsessed 

with being fully American that 
I never had the chance to speak 
to my grandmother in Arabic 
before she passed.

I’m angry a woman in our 

small town took off her head 
scarf because she didn’t want 
her kid to be bullied at school.

I’m angry I was never taught 

to feel beautiful with my dark 
skin and darker body hair.

Most of all, I’m angry I felt 

the need to prove myself to a 
country that I never made prove 
itself to me. I was taught as the 
daughter of immigrants to love 
America, and I think it’s about 
time America showed love to its 
immigrants.

4A — Monday, April 2, 2018

I

t is Wednesday night and 
I am crawling into bed 
after yet another busy 

day. I have class from 11am to 
7pm with a lunch break in the 
middle and practice shortly 
after, which then lasts until 
11pm. I come home, shower, 
find some food, finish (or start) 
my homework and before I 
know it, it’s 3 a.m. again. I look 
at my schedule for tomorrow 
and it isn’t any better. Between 
classes, 
different 
meetings, 

a doctor’s appointment and 
lifting times, I’m not entirely 
sure if I will even have time to 
eat, so I jump out of bed and 
throw a couple extra granola 
bars and a fruit pack into my 
backpack.

As I lay back down in bed, 

I think. I think of the four 
different papers I have due this 
week and about how I’m going 
to write them. I think about 
how badly I need to vacuum 
and how I’m down to my last 
pair of clean socks. I think 
about writing this article. And 
I think about how lucky I am to 
be so terrifically busy.

Now don’t get me wrong, 

this is not a common thought. 
Usually I go to bed thinking 
about how much I hate school 
and doing chores and just 
general adulting. I tell myself 
the same “poor me” story, 
hoping to find comfort in my 
excuses. But tonight I have this 
foreign sense of optimism and 
I think I like it. I think I need 
to go to bed less often with that 
“poor me” attitude and more 
often with the knowledge that 
I am blessed beyond compare.

Every day, I am able to eat 

all the food I need and sleep 

just enough (I haven’t quite 
succumbed to sleep deprivation 
yet). I am currently receiving 
one of the best educations in 
the world. I have many good 
friends by my side and man’s 
best friend curled up at my feet. 
I have a family who loves me 

and a roof over my head.

Meanwhile, 
every 
day, 

people 
are 
dying 
from 

starvation, about 21,000 to 
be exact. Most of the world’s 
population is unable to even 
attend college and, in fact, in 
2010 only 6.7 percent actually 
hold a degree of any kind. As I 
sit in bed with the furnace on 
(set to 63 degrees Fahrenheit 
because I don’t like paying 
bills), more than 100 million 
people are sleeping outside 
because they don’t have a place 
to call home. Yes, I do indeed 
have a good life.

I don’t have a nice car—mine 

is actually held together by 
duct tape,—but I do have a car. 
I don’t have a nice house, my 
living room floor is caving in 
and there is a wonderful draft 
through the whole house, but I 
do have a place to live. I don’t go 
to the single best school in the 
world but it’s pretty damn close 

and there is no other school I’d 
rather attend. When I am done 
with school, I will be joining 
a rather elite 7 percent of the 
world’s populace. Because I am 
just too damn lucky.

Some 
say, 
“You 
aren’t 

lucky, you make lucky.” I love 
and agree with this saying, but 
only to an extent. Yes, I had 
to work hard and continue to 
do so every day. Yes, I have 
had to make many sacrifices 
to get where I am, but none 
of this would be possible 
without all the good fortune 
and blessings I have had so 
far. I was lucky enough to be 
born in the United States (or 
any developed country), to 
start. I was lucky enough to 
have access to every person 
and program that was able and 
willing to help take care of me 
when I needed it. And I was 
lucky enough to have friends 
and family that support me 
through 
own 
journey 
of 

adulthood.

Too often, we get too 

caught up in our own lives, too 
caught up in the daily race to 
the top. We are too busy trying 
to satisfy our own selfish 
wants and needs that we never 
stop to appreciate where we 
are and how far we have come. 
We fail to acknowledge how 
lucky we all are in our own 
right. I’m not saying we should 
cease to be hungry for more 
and stop reaching for greater 
heights, I’m only saying we 
should stop to realize how 
truly blessed each and every 
one of us really is.

Busy and blessed

A few words on crosswords

JULIA COHN | COLUMN

T

his year I started doing 
the New York Times 
Daily 
Crossword 

puzzle. Little did I know, this 
game would become a huge 
part of my everyday routine. 
If you would’ve asked me 
what a crossword was a year 
ago, I probably wouldn’t have 
been able to give you a concise 
answer. I would have told you 
that my dad completes them 
wearing his reading glasses, 
sitting at the kitchen table, 
pen held high, fixated on 
clues at hand. But now, my 
daily crossword elicits the 
same kind of excitement as 
seeing a puppy on the Diag. 
This sounds like the nerdiest 
thing, right? If you answered 
yes, you are definitely correct. 
But crosswords, like most 
activities that become central 
in one’s life, have allowed me 
to embrace the nontraditional 
aspects of passion.

In defense of crosswords, 

they are extremely applicable 
to 
current 
events. 
Clues 

range from categories like 
politicians 
to 
animals 
to 

sports. The diverse range 
of 
questions 
expose 
me 

to a much wider base of 
knowledge. I have a theory 
that 
every 
time 
you 
are 

presented with a new piece 
of information, you become 
a smarter and more well-
rounded individual. Solving 
the answer to one clue might 
not seem like you are on track 
to become a genius. But over 
time, this new information 
becomes extremely valuable.

On Mondays, the puzzles 

are the shortest and easiest. 
As 
the 
week 
progresses, 

the clues get increasingly 
longer and more difficult. 
As a very, very untalented — 
but motivated — crossword 
solver, it takes me hours 
to get through the Monday 
crossword 
(compared 
to 

my dad, for example, who 
usually solves the puzzle in 
15 minutes). Tuesday and 
Wednesday usually offer me 
a 50 percent success rate, but 
after that it is a lost cause. 
Nonetheless, 
perseverance 

is the name of the crossword 

game: There is always value 
in an attempt to solve the 
hardest puzzles.

One of the most rewarding 

experiences is opening the 
extremely daunting Sunday 
crossword puzzle and being 
able to solve a few of the 
clues. I may spend 30 minutes 
scanning the clues, willing my 
mind to pull out phrases and 
names buried in my mental 
archive. When you finally 
reach a eureka moment, not 
only do you feel like a puzzle 
genius, but you are able to 
complete 
something 
that 

represents 
an 
underlying 

challenge and test of mental 
application. 

In addition to the pure 

enjoyment I take in solving 
crossword puzzles, I have 
begun to recognize how they 
represent my freshman-year 
experience at the University. 
I have encountered difficulty 
and reward. I have challenged 
my abilities as a critical 
thinker, grown as a learner 
and, 
most 
importantly, 

embraced 
my 
passions. 

Economics 
101 
presents 

itself as an obstacle, but 
perseverance got me through 
the semester. I have had the 
opportunity to engage and 
learn from my peers, who 
either challenge or support 
my beliefs. And I recognize 
that as unconventional as 
solving 
a 
crossword 
for 

pleasure may appear, life is 
about embracing what makes 
you happy.

Crosswords 
offer 
the 

opportunity to engage with 
and accept help from others. 
My roommate, for example, 
always knows the science 

questions. My friends from 
political science class can 
help 
with 
the 
political 

questions, and my parents 
are always willing to give 
me answers with old movie 
and song titles. This is a 
nontraditional 
mindset 
to 

the crossword: using those 
around you to answer specific 
questions. But it has begun to 
help me engage and connect 
with groups of people and 
their specialized knowledge 
bases. Getting an answer is 
even more rewarding when 
you are able to work with 
your incredibly smart peers.

In the beginning of my 

crossword experience, I was 
often met with a chuckle and 
sly smile from my friends: 
Was I an 80-year-old who 
had nothing else to do? But 
as I remained committed to 
my activity, these reactions 
were 
transformed 
into 

mild interest and eventual 
engagement in the crossword 
world. Passions and interests 
are fluid—they are subjective 
and often situational.

I don’t deny the fact that 

I am a quirky person, but it 
has taken time to embrace 
these 
characteristics. 
In 

college, I have been able to 
grow and accept the fact 
that I enjoy a pastime that 
could be considered a little 
peculiar. But my outward 
passion 
and 
engagement 

with crosswords has spread 
to those around me. I am no 
longer met with eyerolls from 
my friends, and instead they 
turn to me for help on their 
Sunday crosswords, too. Life 
is about discovering your 
passions and sticking to them. 
Hearing others talk about 
what they love can empower 
you to recognize what you 
truly care about. And now 
I know at the end of a long 
day, when I am still unable 
to remember the answer to 
“What is the powerhouse of 
the cell,” my roommate will 
always be there to respond 
“Mitochondria.”

SABEEN KHAN | OP-ED

A

few weeks ago, when I 
was sitting in bed and I 
recieved the email from 

MVision offering me a position 
to run as a representative 
candidate with them, I was 
truly overjoyed. I felt that 
everything that I had worked so 
hard on this year was building 
and that good things would be 
coming my way. I was proud 
to be a part of something that 
was not only a campaign, but 
also a message to the people 
on this campus. I am so glad I 
accepted that offer and that I 
am writing now as an elected 
representative. I want nothing 
more than what Daniel and Izzy 
want: to bring communities 
together 
to 
solve 
common 

ground 
issues. 
However, 

the criticism, backlash and 
negativity 
surrounding 
the 

campaign and my identity as a 
Pakistani-Muslim has left me 
shattered. I have been called 
a token and have become both 
the ammunition and the target 
for people in their never-ending 
fight against the winners of the 
CSG election.

I am not a token. Calling me 

a token de-legitimizes all of the 
work I did on this campaign. 
My achievements have been 
invalidated as a person of color. 

On this campaign, my identity 

was never used to promote the 
platform or target voters. I 
was treated just as every other 
person on this team was, and 
I worked hard to win my seat 
in this assembly. I was asked 
to join this party because I am 
highly 
qualified, 
extremely 

passionate, 
and 
very 
hard 

working. That is also why our 

message resonated with the 
student body andI won my seat. 

I am not a diversion. I am 

a woman with thoughts and 
opinions. Claiming that my 
purpose on this campaign was 
to assuage concerns of Muslim 
representation in CSG diverts 
attention 
from 
important 

causes we need to talk about, 
like building bridges between 
communities that haven’t found 
compromises 
and 
providing 

more access to mental health 
and survivor resources. We 
should always strive to have 
diverse 
representation 
in 

CSG and this party has only 
attempted to begin achieving 
this goal by creating a team 

both 
predominantly 
diverse 

and comprised of powerful 
women 
representing 
many 

visible and invisible identities. 
While CSG has a long way to 
go, as does the community, my 
election is a start, but I can 
assure you it is not the end. 
I will always fight for more 
representation and support of 
those of all communities and 
backgrounds because all of our 
voices deserve to be heard. As a 
woman and a person of color I 

can understand how frustrating 
it is to feel underrepresented, 
especially after making strides 
in a community. I applaud 
those who stand up for their 
communities 
and 
continue 

to 
promote 
inclusivity 
and 

representation. 

I am not going to back down. 

In dealing with criticism from 
both sides I have been attacked 
and tormented by strangers 
and peers. I encourage people 
to use their voices not only 
critically 
but 
effectively. 

Daniel, Izzy, and I have been 
elected, and we promise to 
serve you and work with you to 
enact the change you wish to 
see on campus. As one of your 
elected representatives, I want 
to work with you to act to make 
productive change. We concede 
that, like every other campaign 
that ran in this election, there 
are 
things 
MVision 
could 

have done better. However, 
we were voted into office 
because students believed in 
us and our message. Nothing 
can change the results of the 
election, but we can change 
the culture on campus into one 
that ensures every person is 
heard and supported. I invite 
you to criticize. I invite you to 
complain. But I invite you to 
do it in a way that pushes us 
forward. In a way that works 
with us, and not against us. As a 
constituent you are responsible 
for what happens next in our 
community. I can assure you 
that our MVision family wants 
to help you make it a better one. 

Confessions of an MVision rep

Sabeen Khan is an LSA Freshman

Calling me a token 
de-legitimizes all 
of the work I did 
on this campaign.

L

earning a new language 
is not easy, and as a 
consequence 
neither 

are its courses. Mathematics 
and 
the 
sciences 
are 
also 

languages, 
and 
language 
is 

something that one can never 
be fully fluent in, even for native 
speakers, 
who 
occasionally 

err 
orthographically 
and 

grammatically.

As a math major who speaks 

six languages and is fluent in 
four out of six, I may easily 
assert that with learning a 
language comes an expectation 
to put in a considerable and 
consistent amount of time and 
effort into gaining something 
fruitful out of it. Having taken 
the entire French sequence at 
the University of Michigan with 
only a year of studying the 

language before college, I used 
to perceive the grading for these 
French courses as stringent, and 
the workload only exacerbated 
my anguish.

However, upon taking Asian 

language and German courses 
I realized how erroneous I was. 
Language courses are difficult, 
though 
there 
are 
certain 

aspects of the language (such 
as pronunciation, three genders 
for nouns, or a completely 
different 
character 
system) 

that 
differentiates 
difficulty. 

Additionally, 
points 
are 

deducted for seemingly trivial 
faults, but with good intention 
and the end goal of facilitating 
a strong language foundation, 
which I now greatly appreciate.

The rigor of these and other 

courses make quotidian college 

life hard. However, we consent to 
the schedules that we construct 
and 
should 
be 
accountable 

and responsible to meet them. 
As 
already 
mentioned 
by 

language instructors at the 
beginning 
of 
the 
semester, 

course expectations should be 
taken with a grain of salt since 
the required time to finish an 
assignment and learn a new 
concept is relative for each 
student. The “A” grade that 
a student receives is thus not 
contingent upon whether the 
student is “better” at French but 
upon the amount of effort and 
determination put in to make as 
few errors as possible

A lot of people spent this past 
weekend celebrating something. 
There was Passover and then 
Easter, either of which you 
might have gone home for if 
you’re lucky enough to live close 
to Ann Arbor. Either way, and 
even if you don’t observe these 
holidays, there was one event 
this weekend that swept the 
entire University as cause for 
celebration: We beat Loyola!
The basketball team is now 
on its way to the national 
championship, so since we’re 
due for a new Poetry Playlist, 
this one is going to follow the 
theme of celebration. I tried to 
track down some poems that 
feature outpourings of positive 
emotion and some that involve 
a quieter sense of happiness, 
so there should be a little 
something for everybody. And if 
you’re not celebrating basketball 
or Easter or Passover, then you 
can either take this moment to 
celebrate something else (You 
exist! School is nearly out! It’s 
springtime and soon you’ll be 
able to walk around outside 
in a tee shirt!) or you can skip 
this list altogether and find 
something sadder to read.
“Song,” by Muriel Rukeyser
If this poem doesn’t make 
you want to read every single 
thing 
Muriel 
Rukeyser 
has 
ever written, then I don’t know 
what will. “Make and be eaten. 
Lie in the arms of nightlong 
fire.” Rukeyser was known for 
her poetry and her political 
activism, both of which often 

centered on themes of feminism, 
social justice and Judaism. This 
is one of those poems where the 
diction itself is so electric that it 
demands the reader’s attention 
right out of the gate.
“Catalog 
of 
Unabashed 
Gratitude,” by Ross Gay
Ross Gay, one of the biggest 
names in current Midwestern 

poetry, is probably the king of 
poetic celebration. It would 
have been impossible to make a 
list like this without him. Once, 
a group of friends and I spent 
a night at a remote cabin for a 
makeshift writers’ retreat, and 
one friend read this poem aloud 
to the whole table over breakfast 
the next morning. There are few 
better ways to start the day, 
and I’d recommend trying it 
out, particularly on a day when 
there’s 
something 
extra 
to 
celebrate.
“What Is,” by Jeffrey Yang
Understated and peaceful, 
this one is a bit of a palate-

cleanser after Ross Gay, but 
still well worth the read. It 
takes several themes commonly 
associated 
with 
serenity 
— 
community, 
nature, 
love, 
children 
— 
and 
condenses 
them all into several short but 
impactful phrases and lines.
“More than Enough,” by 
Marge Piercy
This poem is about June, so it 
might be just a little premature, 
but I couldn’t help it. It’s a 
beautiful account of nature and 
a welcome to the “season of joy 
for the bee.” Like Rukeyser, 
Piercy was also a social activist, 
plus she wrote a lot of poetry 
about Judaism — including 
this lovely one about the Seder, 
which you can check out in the 
spirit of Passover, if you’re so 
inclined!
“Odes,” by Fernando Pessoa
This one is kind of framed as 
a love poem, but it does feel like 
it’s in the spirit of a bigger kind 
of celebration, especially toward 
the end. I’m placing it at the 
end of this list because it’s soft 
and thoughtful, but also intent 
upon a kind of closure. The best 
lines come in the final stanza: 
“Nothing that’s you / Should 
you exaggerate or exclude. / In 
each thing, be all. Give all you 
are / In the least you ever do.” 
It’s a poem about appreciating 
moments, and people, for all 
that they are — and celebration 
is a kind of appreciation, after 
all, for the moment that you’re 
in and for the people you get to 
share it with.

COMMUNITY CULTURE 
The absurdism in ‘The 
Death of Abbie Hoffman’

Picture a Friday night on 
North Campus. It is early spring, 
not yet warm enough to have an 
enjoyable walk from one place 
to another. I see two couples 
running late to the show. The men 
take advantage of their longer 
legs to make swift, long strides in 
the direction of the auditorium. 
The women, following close 
behind, visibly let out a breath 
of relief when they entered the 
building. The doors to the studio 
where the play was to take place 
were still closed due to technical 
difficulties. They were not late 
after all.
The studio was small, and the 
set up was unusual. Instead of 
encountering the elevated stage 
and staggered, ascending seating 
typical of theatre, the two couples 
were met by a semi-empty room 
with a few platforms of various 
heights in the middle, more 
resembling a dance studio than 
anything else. Based on Indian 
street theatre and written by an 
Indian playwright, Rana Bose, 
“The Death of Abbie Hoffman” 
is supposed to evoke a feeling 
of inclusiveness and informality 
between 
the 
audience 
and 
the actors by breaking the 
stereotypical roles in which they 
both normally reside.
Having expected something 
else when they entered the room, 
the couples looked confused 
when the ushers quickly directed 
them to sit on the platforms, 
which were already partly filled 
by actors. Soon after, the lights 
unexpectedly went off and the 
actors stood and started speedily 

walking around the platforms.
“Consensus,” 
they 
yelled. 
“Consensus. 
Consensus. 
Consensus,” and nothing else.
Someone died in the play, and 
nobody noticed. “She dies every 
day,” the actors said. “A girl 
named Nina dies every day, and 
nobody notices.”
As for the couples and the rest 
of the audience, myself included, 
it was hard to keep up with the 
action of the play. Heads were 
turning as fast as possible, but 
the actors never stopped. They 
ran, they danced, they screamed, 
they stood. The platforms were 
not comfortable to sit on, and 
there was a constant awareness 
of the actors, as well as an 
inevitable and natural reluctance 
to make eye contact with them. 
What will they do next? Where 
are they? Why did they just hand 
me a water bottle?
Minds were racing as the 
audience tried to decipher the 
connections between characters 
and scenes. The platforms we sat 
on were getting more and more 
uncomfortable by the minute, 
but the frustration kept anyone 
from moving. This was not the 
experience we were expecting. 
We 
could 
see 
the 
actors’ 
calloused feet and feel their 
breath as they ran past us on the 
stage. This unorthodox setting 
made some of the audience 
members feel uncomfortable, as 
it wasn’t what they had encoded 
in their minds for a night at the 
theatre. 
Everyone 
expected 
to be a passive member of the 
audience, but this wasn’t the 
case.
The actors never stop dancing, 
singing or running while looking 
to or engaging with the audience 

in some way. However, every 
song or line they recited, even 
though unrecognizable, had a 
hint of familiarity within it. At 
one point, they broke into a song, 
which the audience recognized 
as “Hey Jude,” but we looked at 
each other, puzzled. The words 
weren’t correct. They sang about 
Donald Trump and campus 
climate. “Hey Jude” sounded 
more like, “Hey dude, have you 
read the news lately?” All the 
actors did was take something 
familiar and turn it upside down.
There 
were 
hints 
of 
familiarity in all of the lines, 
but no line ultimately formed 
a coherent sentence, no scene 
formed a coherent plot and no 
character formed a coherent 
relationship. However, themes 
of social change, revolutions, 
generational 
conflicts 
and 
activism 
were 
present 
throughout the play. Roles of 
actor and audience were broken, 
as well as expectations for a 
play. Rising action, climax and 
resolution were replaced by 
nonsensical songs and lines 
that ultimately added up to a 
bigger theme. The ’60s are dead. 
Protests are dead. We go to 
plays to be entertained. We read 
the news to be validated. We 
are deaf. Nobody is murdered. 
Nobody disagrees. Theatre can 
be used for change, but it is used 
for assimilation.
“This is the end, folks. Have 
a nice weekend,” the actors said 
as they clapped for themselves. 
The actors stood up and walked 
away from the room, leaving the 
audience wide-eyed and silent. 
Nothing had ever been more 
unclear. Who is Abbie Hoffman 
anyway?

TV SERIES
Revisiting TV: ‘The Wire’

Toward 
the 
end 
of 
“All 
the Pieces Matter,” Jonathan 
Abrams’s 
fabulous 
new 
oral 
history of “The Wire,” Chris 
Bauer (“The Deuce”), who played 
stubborn union leader Frank 
Sobotka in the second season, 
remarks that “the show asked a 
lot of anyone who watched it.” 
You couldn’t, he says, “make a 
casserole and watch ‘The Wire’ in 
the background.”
That’s precisely what makes 
“The Wire” so striking to revisit 
in 2018 — a time when streaming 
platforms have made passive 
television watching easier than 
ever, and about a million things 
are competing for our limited 
attention.
It takes a certain amount of 
self-confidence to make a show 
like “The Wire,” which threw 
all the rules for “watchable 
television” out the window. The 
pacing could be glacial, details 
easy to miss, dialogue peppered 
with slang and undeciphered 
police jargon, but “The Wire” 
wouldn’t dumb itself down or 
explain itself or clean itself up 
because it didn’t have to. It’s just 
that good. The show’s brilliance, 
rather infamously, was never 
recognized by Emmy voters. And 
creator David Simon (“Treme”) 
admits that every season of “The 
Wire” was close to being its last, 
given the unimpressive ratings. 
Somehow, though, its legacy 
has endured. Years after it left 
the air, it has rightfully carved a 
place for itself as one of the best 
television shows — maybe the best 
— of all time. Why? It’s a show that 
has — save some pagers and boxy 
computers — aged unbelievably 
well. Just a few themes it 
managed to cover in its five-
season run: the futility of the war 
on drugs, the decline of American 
manufacturing, 
political 
corruption, 
underinvesting 
in 
schools, 
modern 
media 
consumption. 
Sound 
familiar? 
“The Wire” speaks to our current 
political moment in a way no other 
show from that era could ever 

come close to.
Who, after all, can bear to 
watch “The West Wing” anymore? 
Who can look at that world, with 
its 
starry-eyed 
idealists 
and 
orchestral grandeur, without it 
all feeling painfully naive? If “The 
West Wing” was institutions at 
their purest, guided and evolved 
by people dedicated to service, 
“The Wire” is the opposite 
— institutions at their worst, 
crippling, corrupt and stagnant. 
Anyone who tried to reform them, 

or find some agency in them was 
embarking on a Sisyphean task. To 
quote the thoughtful drug dealer 
D’Angelo Barksdale (Lawrence 
Gilliard Jr., “The Walking Dead”), 
“The king stay the king.” You could 
try to change things in Baltimore, 
but you sure as hell weren’t 
going to succeed. Strangely, it’s 
Barack Obama’s favorite show, 
an odd pick for someone whose 
presidency 
was 
characterized 
by an almost frustrating belief 
in the fundamental goodness of 
American institutions.
Obama told David Simon he 
liked the show for its empathy. 
Every season of “The Wire” 
focused on different institutions 

in the city — the first season 
on the drug trade, the second 
on stevedores at the Port of 
Baltimore, the third on local 
politicians, the fourth on public 
schools and the fifth on the media. 
The transitions could be jarring, 
but by the end of the show, we see 
so much of a city and so much of 
its people.
It makes “The Wire” one of 
the most fascinating character 
studies on television. Everyone 
on the show, no matter how 
morally 
corrupt, 
is 
also 
so 
deeply, strangely human. Wee-
Bey (Hassan Johnson, “ER”), an 
enforcer for the Barksdale crime 
organization, 
has 
no 
qualms 
about killing people, but he’s 
also a doting owner of several 
pet fish. Stringer Bell (Idris 
Elba, “Luther”), the Barksdale 
organization’s stoic second-in-
command, audits econ classes 
at City College. When Detective 
Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, 
“The Affair”) searches through 
Stringer’s apartment, he finds 
a copy of Adam Smith’s “The 
Wealth of Nations” on a bookshelf 
and asks, “Who in the fuck was I 
chasing?” It wasn’t a warm show, 
but there’s a real affection for each 
character that shines throughout.
“The Wire,” with its narrative 
elegance and careful rhythms, 
has sometimes been thought of 
as a work of literature. Dickens 
is the easy parallel here — the 
street urchins of West Baltimore 
in all their squalor, with names to 
rival Pip and the Artful Dodger, 
made palatable to the bourgeois 
audiences of HBO. But Simon 
doesn’t think the show was 
Dickensian; he thinks Tolstoy a 
more appropriate comparison, 
and that certainly rings true in the 
sweeping canvas of characters, 
the soul of a nation told through 
the 
people 
who 
inhabit 
it. 
There’s even a hint of inner-city 
Steinbeck to the “The Wire” with 
its lucidity and reverence for the 
downtrodden. In so many ways, 
the show functions as a rich, 
sprawling novel.

Barry Berkman (Bill Hader, 
“Saturday Night Live”) is just 
your 
average 
guy, 
perhaps 
worryingly 
so. 
Literally, 
he ticks all the boxes. He’s 
presumably middle-aged, lives 
in the Midwest and is going 
through a crisis of sorts. You 
know, the typical daily onset of 
existential dread and general 
dissatisfaction 
with, 
well, 
everything. Furthermore, his 
past as a Marine continues to 
play a role in his life, haunting 
him in the process. To put it quite 
frankly, his life simply sucks. 
You can even probably guess his 
occupation. Accountant? Tax 
attorney? Disgruntled engineer? 
Nope — hitman.
As he explains towards the 
end of episode one of HBO’s 
titular show, he was approached 
by a close family friend, Monroe 
Fuches (Stephen Root, “Get 
Out”), to continue doing what 
he was always good at doing: 
killing people. To shake things 
up a bit, Fuches assigns Barry to 
travel to L.A. to carry out a job 
for the (gulp) Chechen mob — a 
group he calls one of the scariest 
he’s ever worked with. Once in 

L.A., he unwittingly walks into 
an acting class while stalking 
his prey, and like thousands 
who flock to the city every year, 
he develops a slow realization 
that no, he doesn’t want to be a 
hitman. He wants to be an actor.

Just 
one 
episode 
in, 
I 
think that this show can be 
summarized by one sentence: 
Bill 
Hader 
is 
an 
all-star. 
Channeling his inner Orson 
Welles, he steps into the role 
of executive producer, writer 
and lead actor, but in a role 
that feels strikingly different 
from 
what 
we’ve 
come 
to 
expect from him. He is tight-
lipped and convincingly plays a 
man who is just sick of his life. 
Rather than expressing his skill 
in more flamboyant ways, his 
acting as Barry is subtle and 
understated. Killing for him is 
just a job. There’s no glamour, 
no excitement, nor the danger 

one would expect from such a 
profession. He doesn’t actually 
relish any kills and takes a 
nonchalant, passive view to his 
job.
Compounding 
everything, 
he is completely alone, which 
is why his life changes as he 
finds a community in the group 
of actors he meets. Taught by 
the brilliant Gene Cousineau 
(Henry 
Winkler, 
“Better 
Late Than Never”), the group 
consists 
of 
several 
out-of-
towners who come to L.A. to 
pursue their dreams. Most work 
during the day as bartenders or 
personal trainers rather than 
hitmen, but Barry finds himself 
drawn to them nonetheless, 
regaining some sort of spark 
in his humdrum life. Despite 
this massive change, Hader’s 
acting makes this surprisingly 
believable.
Barry’s stonefaced, robotic 
nature makes him quite an 
effective 
hitman, 
but 
it’s 
not quite clear how he will 
eventually open up to become 
an actor, especially one that 
Cousineau will come to respect. 
Nonetheless, “Barry”’s mix of 
violence and comedy already 
prevalent in the season premiere 
are encouraging and make this 
show one to keep your eye on.

TV REVIEW

I don’t know about you, but 
I think political satire has lost 
some of its edge. Maybe that’s 
a reflection of the changing 
times, or maybe the current 
presidential 
administration 
has simply made it too easy. 
Regardless, as iteration after 
iteration of the dumb, tactless 
attempts 
at 
commentary 
brought to us by such offerings 
as Showtime’s “Our Cartoon 
President” manage to hold our 
societal attention, one can’t 
help but feel disappointed in 
the state of modern satire. 
That’s not to say the genre has 
completely declined — Alec 
Baldwin and co. of Saturday 
Night Live remain as savvy as 
ever — however it feels as if our 
societal supply of fresh insights 
on 
the 
American 
political 
landscape is dwindling.
Enter “The Death of Stalin,” 
the latest release from writer 
and director Armando Iannucci. 
The film centers around the 
Soviet Council of Ministers — 
including appearances from the 
likes of Steve Buscemi (“Leo”) 
as Nikita Kruschev and Jeffrey 
Tambor (“55 Steps”) as Georgy 
Malenkov — as they frantically 
try to make sense of the chaos 
that follows the death of Soviet 
dictator 
Josef 
Stalin. 
The 
world of “The Death of Stalin” 
is one where the political 
is inextricably tied to the 
personal, where an impulsive 
despot presides over a nation, 
and where everything is taken 
to the most extreme degree. 
There’s no better illustration 
of the type of world the film 
occupies than in the opening 
sequence, where Stalin requests 
a recording of a concerto being 
performed 
in 
Moscow, 
but 
there’s only one problem: The 
performance has just ended. 

Fearing 
grim 
consequences, 
the employees of the concert 
hall frantically scramble to get 
the audience to return to their 
seats and for the orchestra to 
start over from the beginning. 
It’s gut-bustingly hilarious, but 
it’s also a grave reminder of 

how the world quakes beneath 
the boots of tyrants with every 
action they make. 
The film spends its entire 
runtime performing this very 
balancing act, never letting 
the audience forget the gravity 

of 
its 
own 
ridiculousness, 
while 
simultaneously 
never 
letting itself stray too far from 
its 
absurdity. 
Many 
other 
aspects of the film carry this 
duplicitous nature, such as 
how a film can offer biting 
satire 
of 
American 
politics 
while being set in a different 
country 
during 
a 
different 
time period. In some ways, this 
dichotomy is crucial; the Soviet 

Union and communism stand 
as the supposed antitheses 
to 
Trumpist 
Republicanism, 
and yet one can’t help but 
draw 
parallels. 
The 
brash, 
reactionary nature of Stalin’s 
rule conjures images of the 
reported culture of “fear and 
intimidation” in the White 
House today. 
Despite 
these 
parallels, 
Iannucci’s satire never feels 
heavy handed. The film makes 
no direct comparisons to the 
Trump administration, or even 
to American politics in general, 
because that’s not quite the 
point of the film. Iannucci isn’t 
trying to say that Donald Trump 
is a tyrant, or responsible for 
anywhere near the level of 
horror that Stalin inflicted upon 
his people; rather, watching the 
film is like looking in a funhouse 
mirror at an absurd and vaguely 
horrifying 
image 
in 
which 
we can’t help but see vestiges 
of our reality. The film does 
less to harpoon any specific 
administration than it does to 
draw attention to the insanity 
of an entire branch of political 
development, 
one 
centered 
around despotism, fear and the 
cult of personality. 
Throughout 
the 
film’s 
runtime, 
this 
omnipresent 
sense of foreboding never fully 
lets the audience go. As fits of 
laughter turn to sickened gasps, 
we are reminded again and 
again of how shockingly human 
— that is to say, how shockingly 
cruel and illogical — governance 
can be. Iannucci poses greater 
questions concerning why and 
how man seeks power, and 
what it turns him into when he 
obtains it. “The Death of Stalin” 
toys with this dark streak in 
human nature, as if playing 
jump rope with it. It’s in this 
way that Iannucci masterfully 
paints a vivid — and often 
uproariously funny — picture of 
the insanity of despotism.

FILM REVIEW

eONE FILMS

I was fooled by “Leave it In 
My Dreams,” the first single 
off The Voidz’s sophomore 
effort, Virtue. I thought this 
was going to be a Strokes 
album. The muted riffs and 
sharp lyrics sound like an 
Angles bonus track.
But this is not a Strokes 
album, and it’s not exactly 
an album either. Virtue feels, 
instead, like a collection of 
everything frontman Julian 
Casablancas couldn’t do with 
that 
aforementioned 
band. 
It’s an outpouring of musical 
frustration.
It’s a mess, one that isn’t 
well served by determinations 
of “good” or “bad.” Some 
tracks excel, others confuse, 
but Virtue isn’t the sum of its 
unbalanced parts.
And 
Casablancas 
would 
probably love that designation. 
After his bonkers interview 
with Vulture, we know he’s a 

man whose steadfast ideologies 
are all but completely removed 
from reality. He’s easy to 
confuse with a certain love 
interest from a certain Best 
Picture Nominee. Yes, that’s 

right. L’Enfance Nue is older, 
but in no way grown up.
And 
the 
Julian/Kyle 
parallel has never been more 
apparent than on Virtue. “I 
was soon sent off to school / 
Where the teachers gave me 
poison / And I drank it like a 
fool,” Casablancas sings on 
“Think Before You Drink, ” 
a track sonically reminiscent 
of “I’ll Try Anything Once.” 
He’s rightfully preoccupied 
with the world’s suffering and 
decay, but hasn’t yet grown out 
of seeing himself at its center.
On “Lazy Boy” — a song 
that lyrically could’ve been 

written by that one band from 
your high school (see previous 
“Lady 
Bird” 
reference) 
— 
Casablancas sings: “Jackets 
are the eyes to the soul,” 
proving he can actually be 
self reflective. Casablanca’s 
rebranding 
of 
a 
specific 
downtown cool for the new 
millennium 
cemented 
The 
Strokes in the visual cultural 
memory. He seems, here, to be 
trying to reconcile his desire 
for musical recognition and his 
whole-hearted condemnation 
of music the world deems 
“popular.” It’s a true Catch-22 
for Julian: Fame is for frauds 
and obsolescence is for the 
untalented.
For brief moments — “Leave 
it in My Dreams” and “All 
Wordz Are Made Up” — Virtue 
sees The Voidz letting go, 
leaning wholeheartedly into a 
kind of joyful existentialism. 
Nothing matters! Isn’t that 
sort of fun? “No one will care 
about this in 10 years,” he 
sings on “All Wordz Are Made 
Up,” in another moment of

self awareness. He seems to 
understand the shelf life of 

his specific celebrity brand, 
and his precarious position 

in 
popular 
culture. 
But 
these tracks lack the self-
lamentation found in other 
corners of the album. They’re, 
even 
if 
only 
momentarily, 
carefree in their nihilism.
Virtue is an operation in 
nostalgia that tries to front as 
forward thinking. Casablancas 
got slammed for rewriting the 
’70s with The Strokes. With 
The Voidz, he’s moved his 
musical homage a decade into 
the future — mining the ’80s in 
all their synth-filled, vocally 
distorted glory. In that sense, 
Virtue is progressive for an 
artist obsessed with the past. 
But it’s not progressive for 
2018, not really.
Casablancas isn’t looking 
into the future at all. In many 
ways, Virtue feels like a last 
ditch effort — one final shot to 
get all the things in his head 
into an album. In a move that 
leans more towards a mixtape 
than a cohesive album, The 
Voidz bounce from art rock to 
synth pop to a weird attempt 
at metal (the aptly titled 

“Pyramid of Bones”). It’s as 
disjointed as it is unbalanced. 
But, 
as 
we 
know, 
when 
Casablancas is on, he’s on and 
when he’s not, he’s so earnest 
in his attempt that you can’t 
help but applaud it.
For moments he feels jaded 
in his surrender to middle age. 
While his primary business 
has always been nostalgia, 
Casablancas 
seems 
to 
be 
looking back on his own life: 
his youth, his angst, his glory. 
And it’s hard to blame him, 
The Strokes rocked. So we can 
revel in this mess of an album 
a little longer than most, cut 
it’s chaos more slack than 
we otherwise would. Virtue 
is exactly what we knew 
would happen when Julian 
Casablancas had to finally 
grow up.
There are very few things 
I know to be absolute truths 
but among them are these: 
New York rock isn’t dead yet 
and Julian Casablancas is no 
longer it’s savior. And maybe 
he never was.

In the biggest moment of the season, a leader was born

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — 

After the game, Jordan Poole sat 
by his locker with the radiant 
smile that hasn’t left his face 
since February. 

A television reporter asked 

Poole what he’ll say to himself 
when he looks in the mirror 
Saturday night, knowing he 
was going to the national title 
game. For the uber-confident, 
ever-boisterous Poole, this is his 
favorite type of question.

“I’m gonna be like, ‘I look 

good,’ ya feel me?”

There isn’t much with Jordan 

Poole you don’t see. 

His excitement comes across 

with every highlight-reel play. 
His personality shines through 
with every interview and every 
new water-related pun that 
surfaces by the day. When he 
smiles, you see his clear braces, 
a 
fresh 
reminder 
that 
the 

18-year-old’s exuberance is still 
very much youthful. When he 
gets straddled to the bench for a 
careless turnover or ill-advised 
shot, you see the frustration. 
When he hit the shot, you saw 
him run into the Wichita night.

But as his team headed to the 

locker room down, 29-22, in 
the national semifinal, stifled 
by a swarming Loyola-Chicago 
defense 
and 
frustratingly 

listless offensive showing, it was 
Poole who stepped up. 

This time, behind the scenes.
“We 
work 
so 
hard 
and 

everybody on this team is a 
really good player,” Poole said. 
“We work behind the scenes and 
we know what we’re capable 
of doing. Sometimes, if things 
aren’t going our way, I know 
how really good players think. 
You kinda get down, and you can 
be a little bit negative. But at this 
time, it’s bigger than yourself. 
You know what I’m saying?”

Twenty minutes from an 

aggravating ending to a magical 
run, halftime would seem the 
opportune time for a veteran 
leader to take a vocal stance. 

Instead, Poole took initiative in 
the downtrodden locker room.

“Jordan is not a veteran at all, 

actually,” said junior forward 
Brent 
Hibbits. 
“But 
Jordan 

Poole went through each player 
at halftime and said, like, what 
they were gonna do better in the 
second half.”

Added 
fifth-

year 
senior 

Jaaron Simmons: 
“He 
really, 

literally, 
went 

around 
each 

player, especially 
the starters,”

He 

approached 
fifth-year 
senior 
Duncan 

Robinson.

Duncan, you haven’t been 

shooting well this first half, but 
you’re going to come out in the 
second half and make shots.

Robinson, a team captain in 

his own right, scored all nine 
of his points in the second half, 
including two key 3-pointers in 
the late comeback.

Next was Charles Matthews.
Charles, keep being aggressive. 

Land on two feet in the paint. 

Just take over. 

Matthews 

finished with 17 
points on 7-of-
12 
shooting, 

a 
continuing 

resurgence from 
the 
redshirt 

sophomore who 
has been vital 
to 
Michigan’s 

postseason 
success.

Then came Moritz Wagner, 

the junior responsible for half 
of the Wolverines’ first-half 
points.

Moe, keep being a beast down 

there, they obviously can’t stop 
you.

And they didn’t stop Wagner, 

who 
danced, 
dunked 
and 

dominated his way to just the 
third Final-Four performance of 
20 points and 15 rebounds.

Next, Poole went straight 

to 
Zavier 

Simpson, 
the 

comandeering 
point 
guard 

who 
entered 

the 
halftime 

locker 
room 

as 
frustrated 

as 
anyone, 

going 
0-for-

3 in the first 
half with three 
turnovers.

X, you’re going to lock the 

other team’s point guard up the 
entire second half.

The freshman told senior 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-

Rahkman to just relax, that 
his shots would come. He told 
Isaiah Livers, his roommate, to 
get involved in the game, to be 
aggressive in his minutes and 
to continue doing the simple 
things.

In 
the 
second 
half, 
the 

Wolverines 
scored 47 points, 
shooting 
57 

percent from the 
field to win 69-57. 
They forced an 
overwhelmed 
Loyola 
squad 

into 10 second-
half 
turnovers, 

holding 
the 

Ramblers to just 
22 points. 

Michigan will play Villanova 

on Monday night for a national 
title, and it has a second-half 
blitz — and some halftime 
words of encouragment from a 

confident freshman leader — to 
thank for that. 

“It’s impressive, it really is,” 

Hibbits said. “Such a big stage, 
and such a young kid. I mean, 
he’s only 18 or 19 years old. 
Obviously he’s never been here 
before. But for him to have a 
perspective about it himself 
really helped the older guys 
realize, you know, Jordan Poole, 
this outgoing, emotional, young 
dude is having a lot of confidence 
going into the second half. We 
should, too.”

This 
was 
more 
than 
a 

teammate 
offering 
words 

of 
encouragement 
for 
his 

struggling 
team. 
It 
was 
a 

freshman growing into a role he 
knew he could own. 

“It’s leadership,” Livers said. 

“He can be a natural leader, and 
he can be a natural freshman. 
I think at this stage now, he’s 
going to obviously take that 
leadership (role). He may even 
be a captain next year. … I won’t 
be surprised.”

Poole played four minutes in 

the first half, just the eighth-
most 
on 
the 
team, 
before 

offering an on-court spark with 
six second-half points of his 
own. Poole’s role has fluctuated 
as much as anyone throughout 
the 
year, 
with 
Saturday’s 

national semifinal being no 
different. That didn’t stop him 
from taking the reigns of a team 
20 minutes from its end. 

It’s a moment that won’t 

accompany 
his 
game-winner 

on this year’s “One Shining 
Moment” but may well be just 
as important. You can quantify 
a 
shot. 
You 
can’t 
quantify 

leadership.

“I don’t think I played too 

much in the first half, but I 
know that Moe was going to 
start hitting shots and (Abdur-
Rahkman) was going to start 
getting to the basket,” Poole 
said. “If you go out there with 
a positive mindset and speak 
it into existence, everything is 
going to go well. 

“That’s what happened when 

we went out for the second half.”

With Michigan trailing Loyola-Chicago by seven at halftime,Jordan Poole gave a speech that reinvigorated his team

This only comes around so often

G

ood morning, Ann 
Arbor.

If you haven’t heard, 

your Wolverines won another 
basketball 
game Satur-
day night. 
They only 
have one 
more left. It’s 
kind of a big 
deal.

Just how 

big of a deal?

Well, 

the Ann 
Arbor Police 
Department closed down South 
University Avenue after the 
game. People were rioting. 
Police cars were out and about. 
Someone climbed a light pole 
outside Cantina.

I, for one, was at Skeeps 

again. After the game ended, I 
watched five grown men take 
their shirts off. They had a sur-
prising lack of chest hair.

But I’m not planning on mak-

ing you suffer through another 
detailed account of my own 
drunken escapade. Instead, 
I’d like to provide a predictive 
anecdote.

A chance to experience a 

national championship in men’s 
basketball only comes around 
so often (unless you go to North 
Carolina). I want to make sure 
you do this thing right. So, shall 
we begin?

 ***

9:30 a.m. — Wake up. What’s 

that? You slept through your 
8:30? That’s ok I’ll cut you some 
slack. It’s basically a national 
holiday.

9:35 a.m. — Just so we’re 

clear, the United States isn’t 
recognizing today as a national 
holiday. That means your pro-
fessors won’t either, unless they 
do, in which case I’d like to 
know their name. I’ll buy them 
a small gift.

Anyway, you can’t be a com-

plete degenerate. Get in the 

shower. You’ve gotta make 
your 10 a.m. Sing “One Shining 
Moment” if you want to set the 
mood.

10:09 a.m. — You get to the 

MLB. You wonder how this 
building hasn’t been con-
demned yet. You take your seat 
in a lecture hall. The professor 
asks if people will be watching 
the game tonight. Everyone 
rolls their eyes.

The only thing keeping you 

alive is the thought of Jordan 
Poole’s buzzer beater against 
Houston. Literally. You’ve 
watched it 177 times in this lec-
ture alone.

11:35 a.m. — Your class 

should be over, but your profes-
sor has zero respect for Michi-
gan Time. They joke about 
making sure that paper is done 

by tomorrow morning. No one 
is laughing.

11:40 a.m. — This is where 

it gets tricky. There are two 
types of people. 
Choose wisely:

Person 

A. You have 
another class. 
You’re already 
late, so you 
don’t go. Or you 
couldn’t focus 
in the last one, 
so you don’t 
go. Or lunch 
sounds really 
good right now, 
so you don’t go. 
But really, your friends have 
been texting in your group chat 
all morning and are going to 
(insert bar here) at noon. Either 

way, you’ve missed your second 
class of the day.

Person B. You go to the sec-

ond class. Your next professor 

makes the same 
jokes. You go to 
the gym after, 
and plan what’s 
next. Person A is 
already drunk. 
They might not 
remember the 
game. Keep that 
in mind.

1:00 p.m. — 

Regardless of 
your path, you’ll 
need to do some 
pregame reading. 

What’s that? You don’t know 
what to read or where to go for 
it? Lucky for you, I know some 
people.

Read about Michigan being 

an underdog. Read about Zavier 
Simpson’s matchup with Jalen 
Brunson. Read about the losses 
that the Wolverines took to get 
here. Read about how Michigan 
knows it took a bit of luck to 
reach the title game.

Read it all on michigandaily.

com. Shameless plug. 

2:00 p.m. — Get lunch. Buy a 

coffee. You’re gonna be up late 
tonight.

4:00 p.m. — If you’re Person 

A, you’re already drunk. You 
look outside and see a line of 
people down the street who 
will never make it into the bar 
for tip off, or will have to pay 
to do so. You smile to yourself. 
Skipping that class was worth 
it. You reward yourself with 
your second — or 11th — pitcher.

If you’re Person B, you 

scramble fervently to finish 
your schoolwork. You didn’t go 
out Friday. You wanted to save 
money so you could skip the 
line.

5:00 p.m. — Person B throws 

on some Michigan gear. You 
get to (insert bar here), and pay 
that line-skipping fee. As you’re 
walking inside, you see some-
one stumbling out of the bar 
with the help of two bouncers. 
That’s Person A.

8:00 p.m. — Person B is with 

their friends, getting settled 
in for the game. Person A 
wakes up in a panic. They can’t 
remember what happened, but 
they’re oddly buzzed. They 
walk to their friends’ house for 
a viewing party.

9:00 p.m. — Go to the bath-

room. Get a beer. No, you can’t 
do both at the same time. I 
know those two things are 
counterintuitive, but this is the 
last chance you have before 
halftime. Don’t risk it during 
the commercials, especially if 
you’re Person B.

9:20 p.m. — The game starts. 

Breathe.

11:50 p.m. — I’m estimating 

here, but the game is over.

Maybe Michigan wins. You 

riot and don’t go to bed.

Maybe Michigan loses. You 

riot and then you go home and 
wonder what could have been.

Regardless of if you’re at a 

bar, at a viewing party or sitting 
in your bed, you just watched 
something you’re never going 
to forget.

So again: good morning, Ann 

Arbor.

You want the truth? It 

doesn’t matter what you do 
tomorrow.

You’re going to remember 

this for the rest of your life.

Wagner turns in best performance yet on biggest stage

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — 

Moritz Wagner left his hotel 
room early on Friday.

The 
junior 
forward 
was 

anxious about the Michigan 
men’s basketball team’s Final 
Four matchup with Loyola-
Chicago, and he couldn’t stand 
sitting still anymore, letting the 
nerves fester.

So he told his roommate, 

sophomore center Jon Teske, 
that he was leaving.

“I was a little restless and 

wanted 
to 
get 
out 
there,” 

Wagner 
said. 
“When 
you 

prepare for a week for a game, 
I hate that. I want to play 
basketball, that’s why I play.”

Who could blame Wagner for 

getting restless? In a postseason 
where every game is the new 
biggest game of Wagner’s and 
every other Wolverine’s career, 
Saturday’s game was the next 
one up.

In hindsight, Wagner had 

nothing to worry about.

When 
all 
was 
said 
and 

done, he dropped 24 points 
and 15 rebounds in front of 
68,000-plus, fueling his team 
to an appearance in the NCAA 
Championship 
game. 
The 

performance was the third time 
in history that a player had a 
20-point, 15-rebound game in 
the semifinals, putting Wagner 
in the same company as Hakeem 
Olajuwon and Larry Bird.

“Wow. If you put it like that, 

it’s probably cool,” Wagner 
said of the distinction. “But 
to be honest, I kept looking 
possession by possession, we 
had trouble scoring (in) the first 
half. We scored 22 points and 
that was kind of the only way 
we found our way to the basket. 
Grab offensive rebounds and 
get second-shot opportunities.”

It’s typical of Wagner to 

shrug off his accomplishment. 

After all, this is the same 
guy who has said he doesn’t 
understand America’s obsession 
with awards.

But 
especially 
on 
the 

rebounding side 
of 
things, 
the 

performance is a 
standout one.

Part 
of 

Wagner’s 
success 
can 

be credited to 
John 
Beilein’s 

gameplan. 
Instead 
of 

the 
pick-and-

pops 
that 

have become Wagner’s bread 
and butter, Beilein decided 
that, against the undersized 
Ramblers, Wagner could be 
used as an asset on the glass. 

So Beilein told him to dive 
down to the block when a guard 
switched onto him.

But most of the success 

should be credited to Wagner 

himself. 
His 

immense growth 
on the boards 
was 
evident 

in 
Saturday’s 

national 
semifinal.

The 
knock 

on Wagner had 
always 
been 

his defense and 
rebounding, 
and 
he’s 

acknowledged that before. He’s 
worked tirelessly to improve 
those parts of his game, and it’s 
shown, in flashes, over the year.

Never like Saturday, though. 

Against a smaller opponent, 
Wagner feasted on the glass. 
Six of his 15 boards were on the 
offensive end, both good enough 
for career highs. It seems his 
hard work has paid off.

 “I think we all forget when 

we’re recruiting, which players 
are gonna grow? Or which ones 
are gonna transfer because they 
aren’t growing fast enough, 
because they’re probably not 
putting in the work?” Beilein 
said. “Moe puts in the work.

“You know, his freshman 

year, we had to get him off the 
court over and over again. He’d 
have a flash, and then we’d say, 
‘What is going on?’ Gradually, 
he’s growing and he’s growing. 
He’ll misstep, but he grows. 
That’s what good players do, and 
that’s how college teams win. 

And that’s also how you have a 
great career after college.”

Early in his career, Beilein 

had to take Wagner off the 
court. Saturday, there was no 
option 
but 
to 

leave 
him 
out 

there. 
That 

was 
partially 

because of his 
play, but it was 
also 
because 

Teske, Wagner’s 
backup, 
picked 

up 
two 
early 

fouls.

So 
Wagner 

played 19 first-
half minutes, getting a double-
double in the frame with 11 
points and 11 boards. If he 
hadn’t, the Wolverines, who 
shot just 29 percent from the 

field and 15.4 from three, may 
not have been within reaching 
distance of Loyola.

As Wagner jogged up the 

tunnel at halftime, his jersey 
was so drenched with sweat 
it was nearly see-through. He 
finished with 36 minutes, tied 
for the most he’s ever played in 
a game without overtime.

“He’ll be able to hold up, but 

we’ve gotta get him a lot of rest 
tomorrow,” Beilein said. “… But 
Moe, we played him a lot. We 
played him a lot — probably too 
many minutes — but I thought 
we had to to win the game, so 
we can play Monday. But he’ll 
have a day of rest. He’s pretty 
good at that.”

For all the new sides to 

Wagner’s game that Saturday’s 
performance showed, there was 
all the old stuff, too.

He still exhibited the deep 

range, 
going 
3-for-7 
from 

beyond the arc, and he still 
was his goofy self, flexing and 
celebrating 
for 
the 
crowd. 

He even leapt over the CBS 
announcing team at one point.

For now, Wagner says he’s 

exhausted, and for good reason.

In 
a 
game 
that 
many 

expected to be decided by the 
matchup between the big men, 
Wagner came out on top. And in 
a season when the Wolverines 

have looked to 
Wagner 
time 

and time again 
to 
provide 
a 

spark, he came 
through again.

On Saturday, 

the old and new 
parts of Wagner 
combined 
to 

form 
the 
best 

version of him 
yet. 
Despite 

the sweat and the grind and 
the weight of his team on his 
shoulders and a near collision 
with an announcers table, they 
couldn’t take him off the floor.

exhausted, and

Matthews mean mugs his way to title game

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — 

After the final buzzer sounded, 
Charles 
Matthews 
was 
the 

last player to climb down the 
elevated floor and swagger his 
way to the concrete underbelly 
of the Alamodome. Many of his 
teammates, smiling from ear-
to-ear and yelling at full throat, 
had chosen to go through a line 
of high-fives with Michigan 
students. Moritz Wagner even 
jumped to meet the hands draped 
over the railing above, reenacting 
an NBA combine vertical test.

Matthews took a different 

approach. He trotted down the 
steps, showed the camera the 
name across the front of his 
bright-maize jersey and sashayed 
down the tunnel unbothered. His 
chin pointed high, he molded a 
half-smiled smirk. It was a look 
of confidence — one of those, “I’m 
good, and I know it,” faces.

Matthews 
breathed 
that 

moxie throughout Saturday. The 
redshirt sophomore guard scored 
17 points, grabbed five boards 
and added three steals against 
the darlings of his hometown 
Chicago, helping to send the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
to the national championship.

“Charles was a beast,” said 

freshman forward Isaiah Livers. 
“We see him like that all the time 
in practice. I was wondering 
when it was going to come out 
again, and it came out at the right 
time.”

It came out early. When the 

Ramblers switched a screen 
on 
the 
Wolverines’ 
second 

possession, 
Matthews 
found 

himself in a glaring mismatch 
against 
Ramblers’ 
center 

Cameron Krutwig. Matthews 
knew what to do: Jab step, 
pump fake and then pop it for 
Michigan’s first three points. 
Five minutes later, he drove 
inside and sunk a layup with 
a foul, “mean mugging” as he 
swaggered across the baseline in 
celebration.

“We feel like we’re at our best 

when he’s aggressive,” said fifth-
year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson, “and that’s been the 

case all season.”

Matthews was essentially one 

of two consistent options for 
the Wolverines offensively, as 
the rest of the team desperately 
struggled to hit shots. As such, 
Matthews was the go-to option 
when Loyola clung to a seven-
point lead early in the second 
half, slashing his way to a pair of 
scores to keep things close.

“I really saw an intense look 

in his eyes — he really wanted to 
win,” said freshman guard C.J. 
Baird. “Nobody was going to let 
anybody stop him.”

Wagner, of course, eventually 

charged the comeback for the 
Wolverines, finishing with a 
monstrous 24-point, 15-rebound 
performance. 
But 
it 
was 

Matthews who helped Wagner 
and the Wolverines get there.

Up 
a 
nickel, 
Matthews 

penetrated and collapsed the 
defense, then kicked to a wide-
open 
Wagner 
outside, 
who 

essentially put the game away 
with just over 3:03 to go.

And if it wasn’t over then, it 

certainly was two minutes later 
when 
Matthews 
punctuated 

his night with a two-handed 
tomahawk jam.

“It’s the big stage. Charles has 

been waiting for this for a while,” 
Livers said. “He transferred 
from one of the top-tier teams in 
the country, and he comes here 
wanting to do that same thing. 
He’s going to put on a show no 
matter what.”

There were long stretches 

where 
Matthews 
was 
far 

from that. After leading the 
Wolverines in scoring during 
non-conference play, his play 
halted in January and February. 
Matthews pressed, settling for 
contested fadaways and low-
percentage 
two-pointers. 
He 

traveled like clockwork, his feet 
shuffling instead of moving in 
harmony.

Things hit rock bottom when 

Matthews went scoreless against 
Penn State in February — a 
surprising turn for a player who 
was once Michigan’s leading 
scorer. 
Coach 
John 
Beilein 

thought 
Matthews 
wasn’t 

playing with much confidence.

But Matthews has certainly 

found 
it 
in 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament. 
He 
had 
31 

combined points in the first 
two rounds, then 35 and a West 
Regional MVP Award in the 
second weekend.

“This young man has done 

such a good job of just growing 
as a player,” Beilein said. “And 
it’s showing off every day that he 
goes out there.

“His 
future 
is 
brilliant. 

Absolutely brilliant.”

Saturday was still Wagners’ 

night. 
But 
Matthews 
was 

undoubtedly 
essential 
to 

Michigan’s win, playing Robin to 
Wagner’s Batman along the way.

And if his walk off the floor 

is any indication, Mattthews is 
perfectly okay with that.

Charles Matthews tallied 17 points, five rebounds and three steals.

Even though Saturday’s storm 

had long passed by the time Tera 
Blanco set foot on Alumni Field, 
the senior right-hander showed 
that when it rains, it pours.

With the Michigan softball 

team nursing a 1-0 lead heading 
into the fifth inning, it was time 
to make something happen. In 
the previous inning, Blanco was 
pulled from her pitching duties 
after Purdue loaded the bases. 
While she could no longer help 
in the circle, she could make 
something happen at the plate.

The Wolverines had the bases 

loaded when Blanco settled into 
her hitting stance and sized 
up 
Boilermakers’ 
right-hander 

Sydney Bates’ first pitch.

Smack. Grand slam. Almost 

effortlessly, it was 5-0.

“Right before that at-bat Hutch 

told me don’t try too hard, and 
I think that was my motto all 
weekend: Don’t try all weekend 
and be short to the ball,” Blanco 
said. “That was really successful 
for me and I had a feeling they 
were going to throw me outside 
that pitch.”

For much of Michigan’s 6-0 

win, which concluded a three-
game sweep of Purdue, the 
Wolverines put pressure on Bates. 

Junior outfielder Natalie Peters 
reached third base in both the first 
and third innings off Boilermaker 
errors, and each time it seemed 
like Michigan was ready to blow 
the game wide open. Even senior 
utility player Nikki Wald spent 
some time on third base in the 
fourth.

In 
each 
instance 
though, 

the Wolverines simply couldn’t 
convert. 
Freshman 
designated 

hitter Lou Allan grounded out to 
third base to strand Peters in the 
first inning. Two innings later, 
Peters watched Allan ground 
out again, this time to first. In 
the fourth, junior catcher Katie 
Alexander watched Bates’ pitch 
sail by her for a strikeout, and the 
crowd let out an audible groan.

But 
Purdue 

wasn’t 
having 

much 
luck 
at 

the plate either. 
Even 
though 

they 
threatened 

in 
the 
fourth, 

freshman 
left-

hander Meghan 
Beaubien 
came 

in 
for 
Blanco 

and baited the 
Boilermakers into 
a groundout.

“We weren’t sure if she was 

ready,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins on Beaubien. “I went 

to to the mound to give Meghan 
a little extra time. I think Tera 
was ready but our offense wasn’t 
exactly zooming along, so we 
needed to hold them down. I just 
told her to do her part. We need 
everyone to do their part.”

From that point on, Purdue 

struggled to consistently get on 
base, which Beaubien credited to 
coming in with a positive mindset.

“When you come in with the 

bases loaded you can’t go in with 
that mindset that ‘oh the bases are 
loaded’,” Beaubien said. “You just 
gotta go in and throw your pitch, 
and I trust that the pitch I throw is 
good enough to get them out.”

In a game filled with stranded 

baserunners 
and 
inconsistent 

pitching, Beaubien and Blanco 

reminded 
Michigan, 
the 

Boilermakers 
and 
everyone 

in 
attendance 

that 
softball, 

in the words of 
Hutchins, has to 
be played one ball 
and one pitch at a 
time.

After 
all, 

Blanco 
only 

needed one towering hit and one 
ill-placed pitch to ensure Purdue 
stormed back to West Lafayette 
winless.

Blanco’s grand slam leads Michigan to 5-0 win

‘M’ embraces underdog role again

SAN 
ANTONIO, 
Texas 
— 

The Michigan men’s basketball 
team is playing in the NCAA 
Championship game against No. 
1-seeded Villanova on Monday 
Night.

No need to go to check your 

glasses, you read that correctly.

The Wolverines (33-7 overall) 

have 
juggled 
elite 
defensive 

performances, scattered offensive 
spurts and a dash of luck to get to 
this point. But on paper, Michigan’s 
performance isn’t an accident 
— it’s been the favorite in all five 
tournament games its played in 
thus far.

But now, the Wolverines come 

in as the underdog, and even 
that’s an understatement. Some 
media members have asked if the 
championship trophy can be gifted 
prematurely to the Wildcats.

The overreaction is baseless 

but unsurprising. Villanova (35-4) 
rained 13 3-pointers just in the first 
half as part of a 95-79 walloping 
against Kansas on Saturday. It was 
a game that Michigan coach John 
Beilein said he was glad he didn’t 
have time to watch. The Wildcats 
are led by guard Jalen Brunson — 
who averages 19.2 points per game 
— on an already-complete roster.

“As a point guard, and one who 

wants to be elite at the next level, 
who wouldn’t want to look forward 
to a matchup like Brunson (who 
is) a National Player of the Year?” 
questioned 
sophomore 
point 

guard Zavier Simpson. “They’re 
a great team. They aren’t No. 1 in 
the country for no reason. We have 
to come ready to play, or we’ll get 
embarrassed.”

Added assistant coach Saddi 

Washington: “At this point in the 
season, you’re not really gonna out-
trick your opponent. You’ve just 
gotta be the best version of who you 
are and hope that’s good enough.”

So yes, Michigan is the clear 

underdog. But that’s right where 
this team wants to be.

“When 
you’re 
the 
favorite, 

especially playing against lower 
seeds in the NCAA Tournament, it 
just adds more pressure,” said senior 
guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman. “You just don’t want to 
be that team that gets upset. I think 
our identity from the beginning has 
been being underdogs throughout 
the season.”

Michigan coach John Beilein 

said that the Wildcats have many 
similarities 
to 
Loyola-Chicago, 

with more size and another 
shooter at the “5” spot. Villanova’s 
frontcourt of Omari Spellman 
and Eric Paschall not only brings 
athletic shot-blocking prowess, but 
the duo has also combined for 100 
triples this season.

The Wildcats’ strategy isn’t new 

to the Wolverines. But Villanova 
spaces the floor well and knocks 
down shots at a higher clip than 
anyone Michigan has faced this 
year.

“We’ve faced some shooting 

post 
players 
like 
Nebraska, 

Michigan State when they would 
go with a smaller lineup with Jaren 
Jackson Jr., those types of teams,” 
Washington 
said. 
“Spellman, 

Paschall — those guys are playing 
at an unbelievable level right now. 
What they did last night (against 
Kansas) was impressive.”

For a team as volatile as 

Michigan, it knows not to get 

intimidated by how the Wildcats 
breezed through the tournament to 
get to this point. It’s another chip on 
the Wolverines’ shoulders, who are 
comfortable “getting in the mud,” 
according to fifth-year senior point 
guard Jaaron Simmons.

But they will have their work 

cut out stopping Villanova’s 3-point 
shooting. The Wildcats have made 
the most treys in the country, ahead 
of the second-place team by 1.6 
threes per game. In the tournament, 
Michigan has held opponents to 
just 24 percent on 3-pointers, while 
Villanova has converted on 42.3 
percent of their attempts.

If 
the 
Wildcats 
can’t 
hit 

their threes, it could turn into a 
rockfight — a type of game that 
the Wolverines are accustomed 
to playing. It’s not flashy. Perhaps 
it’s why Michigan was hardly on 
the national radar before the Big 
Ten Tournament. But now the 
Wolverines are here in the title 
game, and they don’t care how they 
are being labeled.

“Very few people have been 

paying attention to us all year. 
That’s fine with us,” Washington 
said. “We just go about our 
business each and every day. That’s 
the beauty of athletics — one day 
you’re the darling, one day you’re 
the hunted and one day you’re the 
hunter.”

Wolverines recognize role of luck

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — 

Before Saturday’s game, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
huddled around Jordan Poole 
just outside its tunnel.

The fiery freshman is adept 

at hyping up his team, and he 
looked around before giving a 
galvanizing message.

“We’re not supposed to be 

here.”

Poole was almost definitely 

referring to how the Wolverines 
have been doubted all season. 
Nobody expected them to be in 
the Final Four.

But there’s an underlying 

message that comes with Poole’s 
statement. 
Along 
Michigan’s 

run to this point, it needed some 
lucky breaks to stay alive. Poole’s 
buzzer beater to beat Houston, 
even with the preparation to 
make it possible, needed some 
luck to go down. The Wolverines’ 
path to the NCAA Championship 
game, littered with lower-seeded 
teams, needed a bit of luck to 
materialize.

Those 
are 
fortunate 

happenings that could have gone 
either way. Perhaps Michigan 
isn’t supposed to be here.

That’s not a slight. Michigan 

coach John Beilein recognizes it’s 
necessary to have some luck this 
time of year.

“It’s been an incredible year 

for Michigan with very few 
injuries, a ton of breaks to be to 
this point,” Beilein said. “And I 
feel guilty sometimes about some 
of the games we won because we 
just had this grace fall on us all of 
a sudden. But at the same time it’s 
gone the other way many times 
for some of our teams and you 
beat yourself up as a coach, and 
what could I have done. But as I 
get more experience in this game, 
I realize that’s what it’s about, 
and you can’t do anything about 
those things.”

Fifth-year 
senior 
forward 

Duncan Robinson understands 
this balance too. The year he 
redshirted, after transferring to 
Ann Arbor, the Wolverines went 
16-16. His next three seasons, 
they barely made the tournament, 
lost in the Sweet Sixteen and now 
have made it to the title game.

Robinson 

has seen things 
break both for 
and against him 
and his teams. It 
helps him value 
just how tough 
it is to get to this 
spot.

“I would just 

say 
you 
learn 

very easily not 
to take things 
for granted, in particular in that 
Houston game,” Robinson said. 
“You know, Jordan doesn’t hit 
that miraculous shot, none of us 
are sitting here. ... So, I mean, 
when you think about it like 
that, the only thing you can do 
is just be appreciative that, for 
whatever reason, it’s you and it’s 
your team.”

For Beilein and Robinson, 

experience 
has 
given 
them 

perspective. For the younger 
Michigan players, the perspective 
hasn’t come yet.

It’s easy for them to take it for 

granted, because this is the only 

thing they’ve experienced. The 
veterans try to let them know 
how lucky they are, though.

“Moe was telling Jordan and I, 

I think we were like traveling and 
we said something (that) doesn’t 
really matter,” said freshman 
forward Isaiah Livers. “And Moe 
was like, ‘What? Do you know 
how hard we’ve worked to get 
to the place we are at right now? 
You guys are spoiled.’ Moe was 
saying, ‘You’re spoiled. You’re 
spoiled.’ I said, ‘Hey, I guess we’re 
just lucky to be spoiled people.’ ”

Added Robinson: “It’s hard 

because you can say that, but 
they’re just words. You’ve gotta 
experience it for yourself. Like 
I try to tell the freshmen, ‘The 
next three years here, you could 
have a team that’s far better than 
us, and you still won’t get to this 
point.’ And I’m not saying that 
won’t happen for them, but it 
very well could. Getting here 
is obviously, it’s so tough to do. 
And really good teams and really 

good 
coaches 

and really good 
players 
haven’t 

gotten 
to 
this 

point 
in 
their 

careers.”

Whether 
by 

luck or skill or 
more 
likely 
a 

combination 
of 

both, 
though, 

the 
Wolverines 

are 
here 
now. 

They’ve used their underdog 
feeling as motivation. Now, their 
ability to stay alive is fueling 
them.

Michigan 
will 
play 
in 

Monday’s NCAA Championship 
Game for just the seventh time in 
program history, so close to a goal 
that’s almost impossible to reach.

With one game left, Michigan 

could be a few good bounces 
away from winning it all.

“Sometimes I feel like we’re 

not 
supposed 
to 
be 
here,” 

said sophomore guard Zavier 
Simpson. “So we’ve got to give it 
our all.”

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — John 

Beilein looked despondent. 

The Michigan head coach was 

unhappy with the result, an 86-71 
throat-slashing at the hands of 
North Carolina, and even less 
happy with the effort.

“(North Carolina) might be 

that good,” Beilein said after that 
Nov. 29 contest in Chapel Hill, 
“but we’re definitely not that bad.”

Then he added a remarkably 

confident quibble about his young 
team, one that aged quite well in 
hindsight.

“Just watch this team grow. 

You’ll like what they do.”

Fast forward five months, 

and the Wolverines are on the 
doorstep of a national title — 
assistant coach Saddi Washington 
says he can hardly remember 
the last time they lost. But these 
staggering peaks didn’t come 
without deep valleys.

That 
defeat 
that 
slipped 

Washington’s mind came 56 days 
ago, a 61-52 loss at Northwestern 
that 
saw 
Michigan’s 
offense 

wither at the feet of the Wildcats’ 
sprawling 
zone. 
Since, 
the 

Wolverines have won 15 games 
in a row. A 16th would bring a 
national title back to Ann Arbor.

And ask anyone in Michigan’s 

locker room: the turning points 
of the season didn’t come in big 
wins, but in those stinging lossess.

Just 
24 
hours 
from 
the 

Wolverines’ biggest basketball 
game in five years, and the 
biggest of each player’s life, the 
athletes and coaches were able to 
appreciate the depths that helped 
them reach these heights.

“(Northwestern) played this 

really crazy matchup zone,” said 
freshman guard C.J. Baird, on 
the last time his team lost. “That 
threw us for a loop. We were 
definitely wondering, ‘Where do 
we go from here? What’s our next 
step?’ ”

Since then, Michigan has faced 

several zone defenses, including 
Texas A&M’s in the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament, one 
the Wolverines torched to the 
tune of 99 points and 14 made 
threes.

Less than a month prior to 

the loss to the Wildcats, the 
Wolverines went to Lincoln and 
were dealt their worst loss of 
the season, a 72-52 shellacking 
at the hands of the Cornhuskers. 
Nebraska notoriously switched 
every ball screen in that game, 
a strategy that held Michigan 
center Moritz Wagner to just two 
points. The loss sent shockwaves 
through a team whose offensive 
flow hardly resembled Beilein’s 
trademark offenses. 

At the time, it seemed to be a 

team more likely destined for the 
NIT than the Final Four.

“That was definitely a turning 

point with the coaching staff,” 
Baird said, “because they noticed 
teams would do that now and 
follow suit. I mean, we lost by 20.” 

Instead 
of 
praying 
teams 

wouldn’t 
mimic 
Nebraska’s 

formula, Beilein and his staff 
devised a plan to beat it.

Nearly 
every 
team 
since 

then has tried to reenact the 
Cornhuskers’ 
success, 
and 

guided by increasingly aggressive 
guard play, the offense has 
made the necessary adjustment. 
Resoundingly. 

Monday 
night, 
Michigan 

will invariably see it again, as 
Villanova thrives on defensive 
versatility 
and 
athleticism. 

It’s only right that the truest 

measuring stick of growth will 
come on the sport’s biggest stage.

“I think our losses have shown 

through really throughout the 
entirety of our season — just with 
handling adversity, also with 
handling success,” said fifth-year 
senior Duncan Robinson. “With 
us, it’s all about growing through 
everything, victory (and) defeat. 
That’s something Coach Beilein 
stresses with us, the good teams 
grow from both.”

Added Washington: “I think 

that speaks to the genius of Coach 
Beilein. Whether you win or lose 
a game, it’s an opportunity to 
grow. It’s an opportunity to learn 
something new about yourself.”

“Growth” for Beilein’s squad 

doesn’t 
come 
in 
heaps 
and 

mounds. He’s not big on “rah-rah” 
speeches or big-picture turning 
points. It comes in incremental, 
day-to-day dedication. As cliche as 
it may sound, there was no magic 
elixir that transformed an early 
season pretender into a national 
championship participant.

“It’s just one of those things 

Coach has been saying lately,” 
Washington 
recalled 
Sunday 

afternoon. “‘You don’t try to eat 
the whole elephant, you just take 
a bite at a time.’ ”

That 
elephant 
has 
been 

reduced to a morsel. There’s only 
one more bite left to take.

The losses that shaped a contender 

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — 

Standing against a ten-foot 
mural of Moritz Wagner, John 
Beilein spoke to a herd of 
reporters with a pleasant tone. 
The Michigan men’s basketball 
coach had just earned the 
second 
National 
Semifinal 

victory of his career, largely due 
to Wagner’s historical showing 
of 24 points and 15 rebounds.

But 
when 
probed 
to 

articulate his starting point 
guard’s performance, the mood 
shifted.

 “Zavier (Simpson) did not 

have a great day with the 
ball,” Beilein said. “A couple of 
(turnovers) were just careless.”

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

managed to escape Loyola, 
Saturday was one of Simpson’s 
worst 
performances 

of 
the 
season. 
He 
was 

uncharacteristically 
sloppy 

with four turnovers, and his 
shot was well off the mark, 
finishing scoreless on 0-of-6 
shooting.

“You 
cannot 
play 
that 

way,” Beilein said. “Michigan 
basketball cannot win if we’re 
careless with the ball.”

Though it was indeed a 

blanket 
statement, 
Beilein’s 

comment 
carries 
serious 

weight 
as 
the 
Wolverines 

get set for Monday’s title 
matchup. 
Against 
Villanova 

— the country’s most efficient 
offensive team — Michigan 
can’t afford as many miscues 
from Simpson.

Yet, that’s not even the 

sophomore’s most prominent 
obligation. Simpson will be 
tasked with defending Jalen 
Brunson, the AP Player of 
the Year who averages 19.2 
points per game on 53-percent 
shooting. 

Simpson, of course, is known 

as a shutdown defender. He 
has forced elite point guards 
like Houston’s Rob Gray, Penn 
State’s Tony Carr and Michigan 
State’s 
Cassius 
Winston 
to 

substandard nights. A week 
ago, Simpson made T.J. Starks 
— Texas A&M’s self-described 
“unstoppable” point guard — 
look foolish.

But Brunson is a different 

animal. He can ball-handle 
defenders into submission. He 
can shoot, he can pass. He can 
even post up.

“You got two pitbulls playing 

against each other, that’s what 
it’s going to be,” said assistant 
coach DeAndre Hayes. “He’s 
gonna do some things we 
haven’t seen out of a guard.”

But Simpson has two things 

working in his favor. 

For 
one, 
Saturday’s 

performance is already behind 
him. Players make statements 
about amnesia and how they’re 
not thinking about this or that. 
But when the no-nonsense 
Simpson says it, it feels more 
truthful, and that’s evident to 
those around him.

“One thing about X is that 

he’s strong-minded — he doesn’t 
dwell on the past, he always 
moves forward,” Haynes said. 
“When I played in college, my 
coaches they made me write on 
my shoe, ‘Short-term memory.’ 
I tell all my guards that now.”

When 
it 
comes 
to 

understanding his opponent, 
however, Simpson’s memory 
is indelible. On Sunday, he 
and the Wolverines will go 
through a rigorous preparation 

routine 
— 
one 
that 
has 

endured throughout Beilein’s 
tournament runs.

First, Simpson will read the 

scouting report on Brunson, 
which is usually prepared on a 
white board in the team locker 
room. Then he’ll watch film, 
with each clip corresponding to 
a certain aspect of the Wildcats.

It’s all taken to practice, 

where it’s the scout team’s 
responsibility 
to 
mimic 

Brunson’s game.

That 
responsibility 
falls 

on freshman Luke Wilson, 
Michigan’s 
walk-on 
point 

guard. His job won’t be easy. 
Both 
are 
left-handed, 
but 

Brunson posts up like a big 
man. Wilson’s post moves … 
well, let his teammates assess 
them. 

“(Luke) can’t post up,” barked 

Eli Brooks in the Wolverines’ 
locker room.

“I’ll make him turn red 

today,” Simpson added.

“You’re 
all 
talk, 
dude,” 

Wilson responded.

“Alright, say that for 40 

minutes.”

The 
back-and-forth, 
right 

in front of a media scrum, is 
emblematic of the everlasting 
intensity Simpson carries.

A month ago, he and Wilson 

nearly fought in practice. In one 
drill, Simpson was guarding 
Wilson, denying consistently 
and pushing the ball out of 
bounds. When Wilson finally 
caught the ball, Simpson got in 
his face — so close that Wilson 
pushed him over.

“Everyone was like ‘Oh my 

gosh,’ 
” 
recalled 
freshman 

guard C.J. Baird.

That’s 
just 
the 
type 
of 

competitor 
Simpson 
is. 
It 

doesn’t matter if he’s facing a 
walk-on or star. He’s not in it 
to lose.

On Monday, in the biggest 

game of the year against the 
country’s best player, that’s 
what Simpson will attempt to 
prove once again.

“Definitely a matchup that 

I’m looking forward to. Who 
wouldn’t?” Simpson said. “In 
order to be the best, you have to 
compete with the best.”

Simpson’s ultimate test: Jalen Brunson
