ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

In a large upset victory, 

Republican 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump won the presidential 
election 
after 
capturing 

Wisconsin, North Carolina and 
Pennsylvania, which Democrats 
had considered crucial to their 
victory. The race was called at 
2:30 a.m. by the Associated Press.

On campus, which largely 

voted against Trump, his election 
sparked some celebration, but also 
significant anxiety and concern 
from many students because of 
his policies on immigrants,

Trump 
will 
be 
the 
first 

candidate to be elected to the 
White House without having 
previously served in elected office 
or the military, and his victory 
comes after most polls predicted 
strong chances of a Clinton 
victory.

As 
of 
early 
Wednesday 

morning, Michigan’s electoral 
votes were still too close to call, 
but their outcome will not impact 
Trump’s win. The state, along 
with several of the ones that 

spurred Trump to victory, was 
originally supposed to be a part 
of Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton’s “blue wall” in the 
Midwest. Polls throughout the 
election season showed the state 
leaning towards Clinton but in the 
days prior to the election, similar 
to other states that emerged as 
unexpected 
battlegrounds 
in 

Trump’s path to victory Tuesday 
evening, the state came into 
question again as a potential 
upset for Trump as the race 
narrowed. As of 2:30 a.m., Trump 
was leading with 48.1 percent in 
Michigan. If he wins, he will be 
the first GOP nominee to carry 
the state since 1988.

Because 
of 
the 
closeness 

of the race, both Trump and 
Clinton made some of their final 
campaign pitches in the state. The 
University was also one of several 
places nationwide to receive 
a visit from President Barack 
Obama Monday, who campaigned 
for Clinton on campus in a bid to 
enthuse students and other state 
residents.

Monday night in Grand Rapids, 

at Trump’s final rally, he told the 
crowd that a victory in Michigan 

would translate to a nationwide 
triumph.

“If we win Michigan, we will 

win this historic election and then 
we truly will be able to do all of 
the things we want to do,” he said.

Upon the first announcement 

of his candidacy, Trump was 
not taken seriously by both 

the media and the public, but 
he quickly gained support and 
corresponding media coverage. 
He has built his campaign around 
what now makes his presidency 
unique — being the first president 
elected with no experience in 
politics or the military — and 
overcoming 
significant 
doubt 

along the way.

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

president of the University’s 
chapter 
of 
the 
College 

Republicans, wrote in an email 
interview that he is excited to see 
the country elect a leader who 
he believes will best guide the 
country. The College Republicans 
endorsed Trump early in the 
semester, several months after he 
was selected as the nominee.

“We are incredibly blessed to 

see how the American people 
have recognized that Trump is 
the candidate to truly represent 
the American people, Christian 
values, and conservative ideals,” 
he wrote. “We are exuberant to 
see the end of 8 years of Obama, 
and cannot wait to help continue 
to 
bridge 
the 
gap 
between 

millennials and politics under a 
Trump presidency.”

However, for many University 

students, comments that Trump 
made throughout his campaign 
both in speeches and online on 
immigrants, Muslim Americans, 
African Americans and women 
sparked 
significant 
concern 

Wednesday morning. 

Several 
students 
expressed 

fear for the safety of their family 

Throughout the 2016 presidential 

election, candidates from both 
major political parties visited the 
University of Michigan and other 
locations across the state leading 
up to the primaries and general 
election to mobilize millennial 
voters. While this key electorate has 
had low voter participation rates 
historically, University students 
have deviated from that trend in 
this presidential election.

Over the past few months, The 

Michigan Daily polled a sample 
of University students about their 
voting habits and priorities in the 
election, in effect creating a profile 
of student voters on campus.

In terms of overall preference in 

the election, the most recent poll, 
conducted on Nov. 6, upheld the 
ongoing trend that most University 
student identified as a Democrat. 
In the Nov. 6 poll, 54 percent of 
respondents said their beliefs most 
aligned with the Democratic Party. 
In contrast, 19 percent identified 
with the Republican Party, similar 

to earlier polls as well.

Over the past few weeks of 

polling, 
those 
numbers 
have 

shifted. The data has shown 
support for the Democratic Party 
has grown marginally among 
students, from 51 percent on Sept. 
30 to 55 percent as of Nov. 6. For 
Republican supporters, alignment 
with the party has also grown at a 
narrow rate over this time, rising 
from 16 percent to 19 percent.

In comparison to millennials on 

a national level, University students 
identify less strongly with the 
Republican Party, instead spreading 
their support amongst third parties 
or identifying as independents. Pew 
Research found that voters aged 18 
to 33 tilt Democratic 51 percent of 
the time and Republican 35 percent 
of the time.

As well, University students 

are also more civically engaged 
during elections than national data 
indicates the average student is. 
In particular for the 2016 election, 
student and residential turnout in 
Ann Arbor was exceptionally high 
compared to the national 2016 
average.

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily


As University of Michigan 

students line up at the polls 
Tuesday to select either 
Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton or Republican 
presidential nominee Donald 
Trump as the 45th President 
of the United States, some are 
expressing more hesitancy than 
enthusiasm as they cast their 
ballot and wait for the results.

The race in Michigan has 

significantly narrowed in the 
final weeks leading up to the 
election, after Clinton’s lead in 
Michigan of 11 percent as late as 
October 21st diminished to a lead 
of only three percent t heading 
into Election Day, according to 
the RealClearPolitics polling 
average.

Both the Clinton and 

Trump campaigns have spent 
considerable amounts of time in 
the state during the last week. 
On Monday, both Clinton and 
Trump held events in Allendale 
and Grand Rapids, and multiple 
surrogates visited as well, 
including a stop from President 
Barack Obama in Ann Arbor.

In the final Michigan Daily 

student survey before the 
election completed on November 
6th, 76 percent said they would 
vote for Clinton, 13 percent would 
vote for Trump and six percent 
for Gary Johnson. However, 
in the same survey, only 32.1 
percent of Clinton voters and 
11.5 percent of Trump voters 
said they were “excited” at the 
prospect of a presidency of their 
chosen candidate. This trend 
mirrors the national perception 
of the two candidates, with 
54.4 percent viewing Clinton 
as “unfavorable” and 58.5 
percent viewing Trump as 
“unfavorable,” according to the 
RealClearPolitics polling average.

Some students at the polls 

Tuesday echoed this sentiment, 
including LSA senior Anam Shah 
who said he cast his ballot for 
Clinton, but may have chosen 
differently if he had a choice of 
other candidates.

“Honestly, it’s pretty much a 

lesser of two evils,” Shah said. “I 
am not a fan of her foreign policy, 
domestically, she’s perfectly 
fine; given any other Democratic 
nominee and I had a choice, I 
may not have gone with her.”

Echoing Shah’s sentiments, 

LSA junior Dom Hamid said he 
doesn’t find either candidate 
appealing, but cast his ballot 
for Trump as a vote against the 
political establishment that he 
feels Clinton embodies.

“Both candidates are the 

most unfavorable candidates in 
modern history; I don’t care for 
either of them, I don’t respect 
either of them,” Hamid said. “I 
voted for Trump because my vote 
was mostly an anti-establishment 
vote, I think that the Clintons 
really encapsulate about what is 
really wrong about government 
these days just in general.”

Law student Michael 

Trombetta said he voted for 
Clinton, but also expressed 
discontent with the choices.

“It sucks that we picked these 

two people, because they’re both 
clowns, honestly, they’re both 
clowns.” Trombetta. “It just 
sucks that this is what we’re left 
with, but honestly, I just want 
to be alive in four years and I 
feel like Hillary gives me that 
chance.”

Ann Arbor resident Ryan 

Wolande, who graduated from 
the University in April, wouldn’t 
share who he voted for, but 
expressed distaste by saying 
he thinks this election is an 
extremely poor reflection on the 
United States. 

“I am not going to say who 

I am voting for but you can say 
it is not either of the two main 
candidates,” Wolande said. “This 
is a shit show, this is terrible, 
this is an embarrassment as a 
country.”

Vicki Lawrence, also an Ann 

Arbor resident, said she cast her 
vote for Clinton. She also said 
though she’s been voting since 
the 1970s, this election cycle was 

her most tumultuous.

“Oh it was horrible! We all 

know that, I don’t know anybody 
on any side who doesn’t say 
that,” Lawrence said. “I think 
the amount of vilification, the 
amount of negativity, and of 
course the craziness of it, but I 
think Hillary’s been by and large 
a voice of sanity in the midst of an 
awful lot of craziness.”

LSA junior Drew 

Summersett, said he voted for 
libertarian candidate Johnson 
because he felt he couldn’t justify 
a vote for Clinton or Trump. 
He said he found Trump to be 
rude and selfish, and cited his 
questionable business tactics as 
reasons for his decision.

“I cannot in good conscience 

vote for the main party 
candidates,” Summersett 
said. “Trump’s not a good 
businessman in terms of other 
people besides himself, and I 
don’t want that kind of person as 
my president.

Clinton’s email scandal also 

played a role in his decision, 
Summersett said. He added that 
as a member of the military, he 
questions Clinton’s responsibility 
despite her being recently 
acquitted by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation.

“For Hillary, yes, she’s 

been acquitted twice for the 
email thing, but I’m actually 
a military member myself 
and for us if anything like 
that happened even once 
that’s enough to go to jail 
for,” Summersett said. “For 
someone who has so much more 
authority and responsibility 
than me to be able to get away 
with something like that, not 
to mention she should know 
better, I don’t want that as my 
commander in chief.”

Similarly, LSA freshman 

Sarah Riedel said the choice for 
president wasn’t preferable, but

“I voted for Trump because I 

believe that he is the lesser of two 
evils in this campaign,” Riedel 
said.

However, some students were 

more enthusiastic about their 
choice — either because of the 
candidate they selected, or over 
concerns about their opponent. 
LSA senior Matt Sehrsweeney 
said although he doesn’t love 
Clinton, it was an easy choice 
for him to vote for her because 
he believes Clinton has many 
similarities to Obama.

“I don’t love her at all, but 

I think in many respects, she’d 
make a very good President,” 
Sehrsweeney said. “I don’t like 
her foreign policy at all, but she 
is astoundingly well prepared 
to be President and I think 
domestically she supports some 
important things.”

Another student, LSA senior 

Molly Weiss, also said she was 
enthusiastic to vote for Clinton, 
rather than simply voting for 
her because the alternative was 
Trump.

“I’m definitely excited to be 

voting for her (Hillary),” Weiss 
said. “It’s not just to sort of 
outrule the other candidate.”

Rackham student Nikolas 

Midtunn also voted for Clinton, 
but said he misses when the 
tone between candidates was 
more civil and the prospect of 
the Republican winning was less 
frightening.

“I’m almost nostalgic for 

previous elections, like Mitt 
Romney and George Bush, they 
seemed so innocent,” Midtunn 
said. “I’ve voted Democrat my 
whole life, but the stakes just 
seemed so much lower, it was so 
much safer.”

Law Prof. Michael Bloom, 

who voted for Clinton, instead 
expressed fear at the prospect of 
a Trump presidency.

“It (the election) has gotten 

me more fired up about politics,” 
Bloom said. “I went to college 
here, I graduated 10 years ago, 
and I was a history major, and 
I took classes on the rise of 
Naziism and vimer Germany, and 
a lot of that redirect sounded too 
familiar.”

Many students are facing long 

wait times to vote as lines snake 
through University buildings 
with peak waits of up to two 
hours, and both state election 
limitations or higher than usual 
voter turnout could be factors.

At 8:00 p.m. when the polls 

closed, 1,200 people had voted 
in Ward 1 Precinct 1 and 868 
people had voted in Ward 1 
Precinct 4 at the Michigan 
Union; at the Michigan League, 
1,067 people had voted in Ward 
3 precinct 1 and 1,137 people had 
voted in Ward 3 precinct 2. As of 
Tuesday afternoon, wait times 
were estimated at 40 minutes 
for Ward 3 precinct 2 and over 
90 minutes at Ward 1 precinct 
1. Since then, wait time at the 
League’s precincts has dropped 
to about 10 minutes. At 8:00 

p.m. at the Union, the lines were 
empty. 

Engineering 
junior 
Karen 

Xiong said she was frustrated 
with the long voting lines on 
Election Day, adding if she had 
more classes today she may not 
have waited to vote.

“I think the waiting times are 

ridiculous and they should even 
it out more, because I’ve heard 
people saying other places don’t 
really have lines,” Xiong said. 
“Honestly, if I had more classes 
today, I probably wouldn’t have 
waited this long.”

LSA 
freshman 
Lauren 

Chapman also said she had 
been in the line for Ward 1, 
Precinct 1 for about a half an 
hour around 5 p.m. She said she 
was not going to leave and come 
back, but wait - even though 
she said organizers told her the 
wait would be two hours due to 
incorrect districting this year.

“I debated not voting just 

because of the wait,” Chapman 
said. “I don’t think anyone wants 
to wait in this line, especially 
because in Ward 4, there’s no 
line, so that’s super frustrating.”

A third student, Engineering 

sophomore Andrew Kruper said 
he got to the polls around 4 p.m. 
At the time of his interview with 
the Daily, he had been waiting 
an hour. He said he expected to 
wait at least two hours total with 
what poll officials were telling 
students waiting in line.

“(The election process) has 

been really annoying to hear 
about for the past year and 
a half, but it’s almost over,” 
Kruper said, highlighting that 
though the wait was long, he was 
enthusiastic to vote and see the 
results later in the evening.

Ecology 
and 
evolutionary 

biology professor Meghan Duffy 
also 
expressed 
concern 
on 

Twitter over the long lines at the 
Michigan Union, even though it 

was not her polling place.

“Very long voting lines at 

Michigan 
League,” 
Duffy 

tweeted. “Student leaving 
said she waited an hour to 
vote but line is now twice as 
long.”

Contrary to what other 

election officials at polling 
places may have announced 
to voters, Jim Wessel Walker, 
Precinct Chairman in Ward 
1, Precinct 1 said the delay in 
voting was not due to an Ann 
Arbor ordinance, but rather 
due to a lack of preparation 
for the high number of voters.

“It’s not a city ordinance 

or anything like that, it’s just 
that’s how many electronic 
poll books. The hang up is 
the poll book. We’re issuing 
about one ballot a minute 
with our two poll books.” 

A poll book is the machine 

that 
reads 
and 
records 

ballots.

They 
cheered 
when 

Republican 
presidential 

nominee Donald Trump won 
Alabama. They smiled when 
they saw Rubio win Senator 
of Florida. Like the rest of 
America, they shifted nervously 
back and forth in their seats. 
Some gripped their phones as 
they received notifications of 
results.This was how some of 
the University of Michigan’s 
Republican students watched 
the 
2016 
election 
unfold 

Tuesday night.

Over 
50 
students 
from 

varying University of Michigan 
conservative groups gathered 
in Rackham Assembly Hall 
Tuesday night to watch Fox 
News’ coverage of the 2016 
election — until 10 p.m., when 
they had to leave because they 
had only reserved the room 
until then.

As of 10:45 p.m., Trump is 

winning in Michigan with 49.0 
percent, behind Clinton’s 46.0 
percent.

Students 
from 
campus-

sponsored 
groups, 
such 
as 

Young Americans for Freedom, 
Students for Life and Campus 

Republicans all gathered around 
tables in the hall awaiting the 
result of each state as the polls 
closed, cheering when Donald 
Trump took hold of a state. The 
event was sponsored by Fox 
News.

LSA junior Grant Strobl, who 

organized the event, said he 
wanted to promote engagement 
with the process.

“I put on this event because 

I think it’s important that 
students are engaged in the 
electoral 
process,” 
Strobl 

said. “It’s a lot more fun to be 
engaged in this process when 
you’re with peers.”

Given that Ann Arbor and 

the University of Michigan have 
historically swung left at the 
polls, many students in these 
conservative groups said they 
found solidarity in watching 
the election with like-minded 
peers, such as LSA freshman 
Nicole Hocott, a member of 
Michigan Students for Life.

“I think Michigan is a very 

liberal place, so to be in a 
community where other people 
are like-minded or open minded 
is really refreshing and nice,” 
Hocott said. “Otherwise I would 
probably feel really lonely that 
I’m rooting for one thing when 
everybody around me is rooting 

for the other.” 

Of the students in the crowd, 

the majority said they predicted 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton would 
win the presidency, though 
many students believed the 
election would be close.

“I think it’s gonna be a toss-

up. Right now the polls say 
Hillary is gonna win, but the 
challenge is going to be, are 
Hillary supporters going to turn 
out?” Strobl said.

Hocott said she attributed 

media bias to why she believed 
Clinton is likely to win.

“I think Clinton will probably 

win just because the media has 
misrepresented Trump as super 
racist and misogynistic,” she 
said.

Though many students at the 

event were reluctant to share 
their political views, some were 
open with why they support 
Trump. 
LSA 
junior 
James 

Brown explained that it was not 
the candidate’s ideas that won 
him over, but rather his overall 
disdain for Clinton.

“Really it’s not because I 

wanted Donald Trump to be 
president, but because I wanted 
Hillary Clinton to be president 
less. It’s really choosing between 
the lesser of two evils in this 

election for me,” Brown said.

Music Theater and Dance 

senior 
Bret 
Patterson 
said 

he wore his “Make America 
Great Again Hat” to the event 
to display his loyalty to the 
nominee.

“I voted because of his 

outsider status and just to try 
to break the system of special 
interests 
and 
how 
much 

influence they have on politics,” 
he said. 

Other students said they 

voted 
for 
Trump 
because 

of 
specific 
issues 
that 
he 

supported.

“One of my most important 

issues is abortion, and so that 
was really important to me that 
we have a pro-life president,” 
Hocott said. 

Regardless of their reasons, 

most students admitted that 
they would be disappointed 
if Trump lost, but said the 
Republican party would recover 
from the defeat.

But no matter what the result, 

Patterson said he was very 
tempted to wear his Trump hat 
on campus Wednesday.

“I 
probably 
wouldn’t 

wear the hat to my classes,” 
Patterson said. “I would not sit 
in an auditorium in Angell Hall 
wearing the hat.”

For the Daily

Mirroring the closeness of the 

presidential 
election, 
the 
race 

for two seats on the University 
of Michigan Board of Regents 
remained too close to call as of early 
Wednesday morning.

As of 2 a.m., incumbent Regent 

Denise Ilitch (D) was pulling ahead 
of three other major contenders 
in most key counties as of 2 a.m. 
Wednesday morning. Following 
close behind, fellow incumbent 
regent Laurence Deitch (D) and 
former 
U.S. 
ambassador 
Ron 

Weiser, one of two Republican 
candidates for regent, were locked 
in a tight race for the second spot. 

In 47 of 83 total counties that 

had finished counting precincts 
as of 2:30 a.m., Weiser and fellow 
Republican candidate Carl Meyers 
had received 795,881 votes and 
771,232 votes respectively. Ilitch 
and Deitch were behind with just 
637,245 and 552,657 respective 
votes. However, the state’s most 
populous counties that had not 
finished counting showed Ilitch 
leading significantly, with Weiser 
close behind.

Among large counties that had 

not yet fully reported, including 
Oakland, Washtenaw, Macomb and 
Genesee, results varied.

As of 2 a.m., Weiser and Deitch 

were tied at 22.59 percent of the 
votes in Oakland County, one of 
the biggest in the state, with 515 
out of 520 precincts reported and 
Weiser ahead by just 15 votes. 
Ilitch pulled away from both in 
the area with 302,864 total votes, 
or 26.3 percent.

In Washtenaw County, Deitch 

and Ilitch had pulled ahead of 
Republican 
challengers 
with 

about 50 percent of precincts fully 
reported, receiving 83,794 and 
92,643 votes respectively.

In Macomb County, Ilitch and 

Weiser had pulled ahead with 
almost all precincts reported. Ilitch 
received 175,057 total votes and 
Weiser received 164,465, while 
Deitch had 140,413. Ilitch and 
Deitch gained the most votes in 
Genesee County after 76 percent of 
precincts counted with 80,127 and 
71,971, respectively.

Wayne County — the district 

of 
1.7 
million 
residents 
that 

includes Detroit — had not yet 
reported its results in aggregate 
as of Wednesday morning. Wayne 
usually swings Democratic.

If Weiser were to be elected, 

he 
would 
become 
the 
third 

Republican voice on the Board, 
a significant chance from the 
past decade of a 6-2 Democratic 
majority in the body. The last time 
three Republicans sat on the Board 
was in 2006, when former athletic 
director David Brandon joined 
Andrea Newman (R) and Andrew 
Richner (R).

Weiser, 
a 
prominent 
state 

Republican party member and 

University alumni, campaigned on 
using his finance expertise as the 
founder of McKinley Associates 
to rework the budget to lower 
tuition. This is Weiser’s second time 
running a full campaign for regent, 
after an unsuccessful bid for the 
seat in 2014.

In an interview early Wednesday 

morning, Weiser said he is wary 
of the outcome without Wayne 
County fully reported, noting that 
he was up by 160,000 votes at one 
point in 2014 but lost after Wayne’s 
votes came in.

However, he said the fact that 

Trump is pulling ahead on the top 
of the ballot benefits other local 
Republican elections.

Overall, he said if elected, 

his focus remains on keeping 
the University affordable for all 
students around the state if elected 
to the Board.

“My biggest priority is seeing how 

we can keep tuition for freshman 
coming in at the same level for all 4 
years that they’re in school,” Weiser 
said. “The other is trying to make 
sure the people going to Flint and 
Dearborn have the same quality of 
education as in Ann Arbor.”

Ilitch, a Detroit businesswoman, 

ran for her second term on the Board 
on a platform focusing on student 
affordability 
and 
minimizing 

tuition costs.

“I want to stay laser-focused on 

an affordable, accessible, quality 
education for all students,” she said 
in an October interview with The 
Michigan Daily.

Deitch, in his 24th year on the 

board, emphasized his experience 
and commitment to diversity during 
his campaign. Both he and Ilitch 
criticized Republican presidential 
nominee 
Donald 
Trump 
and 

“Trumpism” at a Clinton rally on 
Monday featuring President Barack 
Obama, with Deitch tying Weiser 
to Trump. Weiser is a finance vice 
chair for the Trump campaign.

Early 
Wednesday 
morning, 

Deitch said he was shocked by the 
results of the national election, as 
Donald Trump had 248 electoral 
votes as of 2:30 a.m. in a race many 
predicted would swing toward 
Hillary Clinton, but he was honored 
to serve for the past 24 years.

“If I win, I’m happy to serve,” he 

said. “If I lose, I’m honored to have 
served my time on the board but 
again, I’m just not sure what’s going 
to happen.”

Meyers, 
a 
Republican 
from 

Dearborn, has focused his campaign 
on three main issues: freezing 
tuition, improving transparency 
between the board and students, 
and increasing in-state enrollment 
at Flint and Dearborn campuses.

“I think the conversation needs 

to be bigger than just the number of 
underrepresented minorities who 
go here,” Meyers said in October 
interview with The Michigan Daily. 
“Focus on black, white, and brown 
statistics does not do justice to the 
challenge here.”

and friends given plans outlined 
by Trump including a proposal 
to ban all Muslim immigration, 
offensive 
comments 
about 

undocumented immigrants and 
bragging about inappropriately 
touching women.

LSA senior Stuart Inahuazo 

said as a Latino student, he 
believes Trump’s victory suggests 
that he is not accepted in the U.S.

“This 
election 
has 
shown 

me that the United States is not 
welcome to other people and 
other cultures,” he said. “It has 
shown that people have come 
out of the shadows by supporting 
an individual who has tarnished 
the culture of America and has 
hurt me on the basis of my latino 
heritage. It has spit in the face of 
my Latino culture.”

LSA freshman Arwa Gayar 

wrote in an email interview that 

she is concerned for the safety 
of Muslims like herself across 
the country under a Trump 
presidency.

“What do you think having 

a president that openly targets 
minorities 
will 
do 
to 
this 

country?” she wrote. “Racist 
remarks have already become 
normalized 
since 
he 
started 

running, I can only imagine the 
climate if he actually becomes 
president. As a Muslim American 
I would truly fear sharing my 
religious affiliations. I can only 
imagine what women who wear 
hijab feel as their religious views 
are openly visible to all.”

On campus, many students 

reacted with shock and distress 
as the results were released. Prior 
to Election Day, Michigan Daily 
election 
surveys 
consistently 

showed 70 percent of students 
supporting Clinton. As well, many 
students 
worked 
throughout 

the election season with College 
Democrats 
and 
Students 
for 

Hillary towards a Clinton victory

Though some students did not 

appear enthused about voting for 
either candidate on Election Day, 
voter turnout was still higher in 
precincts with large number of 
students than it was in 2012.

Before the race was officially 

called, LSA freshman Mihir Bala 
said she hopes Clinton wins but 
does not believe the result will be 
catastrophic for the country.

“I will be pretty disappointed. 

I wouldn’t say I would be 
absolutely devastated because I 
really do love this country a lot 
and I hold out a little bit of hope,” 
she said. “There are people out 
there who believe what I believe. 
We will stand up to racism and 
sexism. Yes, we had a bad day 
today, but we have to roll with it 
and we have to keep fighting for 
what we believe in.”

However many students on 

campus were genuinely excited 
about electing Clinton.

College Democrats declined 

to comment at the time that the 
results were released.

Social work graduate student 

Samantha Cooley, who attended a 
watch party in the Union, said she 
is very upset by Trump’s victory 
due to his lack of background 
relevant to the position, compared 
to Clinton.

“I’m devastated. I’m disgusted,” 

she said. “It’s just sad to me that 
a woman who has 40 years of 
experience in this kind of work 
and then just lose this election 
to a man who has no experience 
whatsoever.”

LSA freshman Ryan Clemmons 

said he was shocked by the results, 
and believes he was insulated 
from the opinions of much of the 
rest of the country due to living in 
Ann Arbor.

“I feel a giant pit in my stomach. 

I didn’t think that this would 
happen,” he said. “Living in the 
college bubble, we’re surrounded 
by so many educated people and 
we all kind of have the same idea 
about this election and I didn’t 
really think about the rest of the 
country.”

From Page 1A

During 
the 
Democratic 

primary, turnout in Washtenaw 
County was reported at almost 
40 percent, playing a role in 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.)’s 
upset victory over now-eventual 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton. That 
turnout rate was more than triple 
the national average Democratic 
turnout, at 14.4 percent.

For the general election, 83 

percent of respondents in the 
most recent Daily polling said 
that they plan to vote in the 
upcoming election, though the 
Daily cannot confirm whether 
they did so. In comparison, 57.5 
percent of registered voters 

participated in the 2012 election.

The 2016 election overall 

differs 
from 
previous 
ones 

as it features two of the most 
unpopular 
candidates 
in 

election 
history. 
According 

to an aggregate of polls from 
RealClearPolitics reports that 
Clinton’s unfavorability is at 
54.4 percent, and GOP candidate 
Donald Trump’s unfavorability 
is at 58.5 percent. In the 

Daily’s survey, 66.7 percent of 
University students gave Clinton 
a rating ranging from neutral 
to very favorable opinion. In 
contrast, 87 percent of students 
ranked Trump as either a high 
dislike or dislike.

FROM THE DAILY

Together we must repair our wounds
W

hat we feel — and what most of our campus feels — is an 
enormous loss in Hillary Clinton’s defeat in this election. 
With Trump’s victory, racism, misogyny and hate appear 

to have won. People who have stood in staunch opposition to Trump 
are now left disenfranchised with him as our leader, and some are 
fearful for their livelihoods. Now we must move forward, both as a 
nation and a campus community. Nationally, we hope the structure 
of our government places strong enough checks on the president to 
prevent our commander-in-chief from doing anything catastrophic 
for the country or the world. And as students, we must mobilize 
to repair the wounds this intensely polarized election has inflicted 
upon our campus community.

On 
a 
national 
scale, 

American politics have taken 
a 
turn 
toward 
nativism, 

populism and anger. By defying 
conventional 
wisdom 
and 

rejecting 
Clinton’s 
message 

of “Stronger Together,” the 
nation has signaled its strong 
distaste for the status-quo 
politician, messages of hope 
and a more inclusive nation 
where all people’s rights are 
protected. With Republicans 
keeping control of both the 
House 
of 
Representatives 

and the Senate and Trump’s 
presidency, our country will 
be forced to reject progressive 
initiatives many thought were 
the future of federal policy.

We as a nation will have to 

rely on federalism to check 
Trump’s power as president. 
Though Republicans hold a 
majority in the House and 
Senate, over 30 have openly 
opposed Trump. We hope these 
legislators form a coalition with 
like-minded Republicans — as 
well as Democrats — to block 
the passage of more extreme 
policies Trump has proposed, 
like 
banning 
Muslims 
and 

building a wall on the country’s 

southern border. If extremely 
exclusionary policies like these 
do 
pass 
in 
the 
legislature, 

governors at the state level could 
play a crucial role in enforcing 
these types of laws.

What is of utmost importance 

about the next four years is the 
status of the empty seat on the 
Supreme Court of the United 
States. If Trump appoints a 
justice whose views align with 
any degree of closeness to 
Trump’s most extreme policy 
proposals, the best we can hope 
for is that the Senate rejects 
the appointment. However, a 
conservative of any kind on 
the court could seem better 
in the eyes of the Republican-
majority Senate than the even-
numbered court that would 
result from the Senate denying 
approval of a Trump appointee.

Perhaps 
of 
the 
most 

immediate concern, though, is 
how to move forward from this 
election as a campus community 
that has been fractured by 
highly 
polarized 
partisan 

politics. Across the nation and 
among 
students, 
individuals’ 

unique identities, beliefs and 
vulnerabilities 
have 
been 

exploited by the media and pitted 
against one another for political 
gain. 
It 
is 
imperative 
that 

students respect one another’s 
voices as the University works to 
heal these wounds.

Though 
the 
results 
of 

this 
election 
come 
as 
a 

disappointment for many of 
us in the campus community, 
we cannot let defeat stand in 
our way. Trump as president 
will set us back on the progress 
our nation has made toward 
a government that is by the 
people, for the people. But our 
efforts on the grassroots level 
can still have a positive impact. 
To recall President Barack 
Obama’s words at the get-out-
the-vote rally Monday morning, 
the 
most 
important 
office 

in a democracy is that of the 
citizen. It is upon us as citizens 
to be champions of inclusivity 
— be that of race, ethnicity, 
religion, sexual orientation, 
socioeconomic status or even 
political affiliation — and to 
work for the change we want 
to see. Together, even in the 
face of hatred, we can build a 
stronger campus community 
and a stronger America.

The real problem with city elections

DAVID DONNANTUONO | OP-ED

L

ast week, The Michigan 
Daily’s Editorial Board 
endorsed a controversial 

City Council ballot initiative to 
extend council members’ terms 
from two years to four years. 
This proposal made its way onto 
Tuesday’s ballot by a 7-4 vote this 
past July and has been a divisive 
topic in Ann Arbor local politics 
ever since, showing a close vote as 
of 2:30 a.m. Wednesday morning. 

Proponents argued that by 

moving council elections to even-
numbered years, there would be 
an increase in voter turnout for 
local elections, as the elections 
would coincide with top-ticket 
races. Those in opposition to the 
proposal believe that it is a self-
serving tactic for City Council 
members because it will decrease 
incumbent 
accountability 
by 

severely reducing the time they 
spend engaging with voters.

Despite each side’s opposing 

views, there is one common 
thread 
in 
each 
argument: 

the need for council member 
accountability. Those in favor 
assert that increasing the volume 
of the electorate in each cycle 
would result in a council that 
is more accountable to a more 
diverse group of constituents, 
whereas 
opponents 
of 
the 

ballot initiative feel that more 
frequent elections and a smaller, 
more invested electorate is a 
more effective way to ensure 
council 
members 
answer 
to 

their constituents. Though both 
arguments have merits, they 
each neglect the real problem: 
the fact that all but two of the 
six local candidates (including 
the mayor) ran unopposed on 
Tuesday’s ballot.

How do we increase voter 

turnout for local elections in a 
way that doesn’t give an unfair 
advantage to incumbent City 
Council members by extending 
City Council terms? The answer 
is fairly simple: Restructure so 
that the general elections are 
contested. If it’s clear that the 
victor in an August primary 
will not face an opponent in 
November, then that election 
should take place in November. If 
such a primary has more than two 

candidates, then the top two vote-
getters move on to a contested 
race in November. Those extra 
three months could be crucial for 
another candidate to gain support 
and mount a real challenge to 
an incumbent. Such a revision 
would ensure contested general 
elections 
without 
eliminating 

the possibility of a Republican 
or Independent running for City 
Council or mayor.

Such an approach is not 

without precedent. California, 
as an exceedingly Democratic 
state, sought to put an end to 
elections for state legislative and 
U.S. congressional offices being 
decided in primaries. In January 
2011, 
California 
implemented 

the Top Two Candidates Open 
Primary Act. This law altered 
primaries so that all prospective 
candidates — regardless of party 
affiliation — share one ballot, and 
the two candidates who receive 
the most votes move on to the 
general election.

Though California’s law does 

not apply to local office and 
puts Republicans, Independents 
and Democrats on the same 
primary ticket, differing from 
my proposed solution, it echoes 
the same sentiment: Uncontested 
general elections are a detriment 
to the democratic process. Thus, 
if it is greater accountability 
that seven of our City Council 
members demand, then let’s 
demand a real answer, because 
ensuring greater turnout in an 
uncontested election is not one.

Given the fact that Ann Arbor 

is a predominantly Democratic 
city, it is no shock that Republican 
candidates have difficulty gaining 
traction in local elections. With 
this 
absence 
of 
Republican 

challengers, a majority of the 
council seats in any given election 
cycle are determined in the 
August primaries, where many 
incumbent council members face 
other 
Democratic 
candidates. 

The only incumbent facing an 
opponent on Tuesday was Chuck 
Warpehoski (D), who defeated 
David Silkworth (I). 

If 
proponents 
of 
a 
term 

extension are actually concerned 
about 
greater 
turnout 
for 

local elections, their proposal 
doesn’t show it. Though it is 
true that turnout is higher in 
even-numbered years, the fact 
remains that there is no real 
competition 
come 
November. 

Because incumbents are running 
unopposed in the general election, 
doubling their terms would do 
less to increase accountability 
and more to reduce the frequency 
of council members interacting 
with and being evaluated by their 
constituents.

In the August primary, voter 

turnout in Ann Arbor stood at 
a dismal 15.5 percent and every 
incumbent 
candidate 
who 

was in a contested race came 
out victorious. Though their 
victories could be partially 
attributed to a solid track 
record as council members, it 
could also be a product of their 
experience and the resources at 
their disposal (as incumbents) 
to 
galvanize 
the 
relatively 

small number of votes required 
to win a primary. In this case, 
for all but one council member, 
a victory in August meant a 
victory in November.

Despite 
its 
shortcomings, 

this misguided ballot proposal 
did achieve one critical feat: It 
illuminated the rarely discussed 
problem of underrepresentation 
in local elections. However, 
rather than seeking a viable 
solution 
to 
this 
issue, 
the 

City Council leveraged it as 
a guise to further entrench 
themselves in their seats. If 
greater accountability is truly 
what our council desires, a term 
extension is senseless. A four-
year term would only diminish 
the 
ability 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 

residents to assess our local 
policymakers 
while 
limiting 

the ability of outside candidates 
to challenge incumbents. In 
contrast, reforming Ann Arbor’s 
local primaries would ensure 
a contested general election, 
empower non-incumbents and 
make our City Council members 
accountable to a larger group of 
constituents.

ARIANA SULEJMAN | OP-ED
Muslim women and the patriarchy

I

slamophobia 
is 
a 
huge 

problem in the West in this 
day and age. An argument 

often cited against Islam is that 
it calls for the oppression of 
women, but this is simply untrue. 
The patriarchal system we see 
today was set forth culturally, 
under the guise of religion, 
to the point that even a vast 
number of women believe their 
subordinance is a religious truth. 
Empowering Muslim women is 
essential to combatting sexism 
within Islamic countries. 

On Oct. 26, Shirin Ebadi, 

Iranian human rights activist 
and Nobel Peace Prize winner, 
visited 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan and spoke about 
the role of gender and culture 
in 
Islam. 
She 
explained 

that since the 1979 Iranian 
Revolution, women have been 
discriminated against worse 
than ever before. For example, 
in Iranian court, the testimony 
of two women is equivalent to 
the testimony of one man. In the 
treatment of homosexuality, 
women are punished far less 
severely than men because 
“(they) do not really have a 
dignity and reputation to lose.”

Of 
course, 
levels 
of 

discrimination between Islamic 
countries vary, but Iran is not 
alone 
in 
propogating 
such 

practices. 
In 
2006, 
Ratna 

Sarumpaet, 
a 
renowned 

playwright 
in 
Indonesia, 

very 
succinctly 
addressed 

the underlying problem here 
when speaking out against a 
controversial anti-pornography 
bill. She stated, “Religion these 
days has become trapped into 
being a tool for power.”

So, how exactly is religion 

being used to justify oppression? 
Ebadi delves into this question 
during 
her 
discussion. 
She 

breaks down many of the parts 
of the Quran that today are 
considered sexist, but had a 
place in their time. For example, 
the Quran states that a woman is 
only entitled to half the amount 

of wealth of a man. This made 
sense because, at the time, men 
were the people who created 
all wealth. But this is no longer 
the case: Women, too, do their 
part in the workforce, and 
because the social conditions 
have changed, so too should the 
laws of Islamic countries. Ebadi 
also cites slavery as an example: 
Though slavery is conditionally 
permitted in the Quran, all 
Islamic countries have since 
prohibited it. If slavery has 
become unacceptable with time 
due to social progress, why 
aren’t the laws against women 
being changed?

How then will the situation 

of women ever improve in 
places like Iran? Just like work 
that must be done in feminist 
movements in the west, women 
in Islamic countries need to first 
recognize that they are being 
treated unjustly and then stand 
up and fight for the rights they 
deserve. Of course, this does not 
excuse men of responsibility. 
They, too, should stand in 
solidarity for the rights of the 
women in their societies. But I 
specifically suggest that women 
not be passive when it comes 
to their own fates. They should 
play the leading role in pushing 
for change and enhancing their 
lives. After all, it was less than 
100 years ago that women gained 
the right to vote in the United 
States. We as a country have 

come a long way because women 
have fought for progress.

This is not to say that similar 

processes have not already begun 
in the Islamic world. A group 
called Musawah, launched in 
2009, works to promote gender 
equality without compromising 
Islamic tradition. Many Islamic 
countries 
are 
participants. 

To combat sexism, this group 
creates educational materials 
that reveal that Islam and 
equality are not incompatible. A 
prominent member of the group, 
Zainah Anwar, states that many 
Muslim women spend their 
entire lives believing that their 
oppression is justified by Islamic 
teachings 
and 
that 
“when 

they are exposed to this new 
knowledge, they feel duped.” 
Musawah represents a route 
for change. And though we are 
on the other side of the globe, 
we as Americans can do our 
part, too. We can both work to 
raise awareness of the existing 
inequalities in these countries 
and also to support groups like 
Musawah, which are fighting 
for change within these Islamic 
countries. 
As 
history 
has 

shown, progress will occur as 
more and more women become 
enlightened and impassioned to 
their disposition in society, and 
the international community 
should certainly support these 
women in the process.

It is often said that history 

repeats 
itself, 
or 
perhaps, 

comes in waves. The wave of 
feminism hit the west first, and 
now, perhaps, it is time for a 
new wave. Olympe de Gouges, 
a French feminist of the 18th 
century, may have been alive 
long ago, but her words written 
in 1791 in the “Declaration of 
the Rights of Woman” still 
have great relevance to the 
women suffering discrimination 
in 
Islamic 
countries 
today: 

“Woman, wake up; the tocsin of 
reason is being heard throughout 
the whole universe; discover 
your rights.”

The bird-man is maybe more attractive than Benedict Cumberbatch.

In the 41 years that “Saturday 

Night Live” has been on the air, 
the long-standing live sketch 
comedy series has thrived on 
the special material that ensues 
during electoral years. This 

year has been no exception to 
that rule, with Kate McKinnon 
(“Ghostbusters”) 
and 
Alec 

Baldwin’s (“30 Rock”) respective 
portrayals of Hillary Clinton 
and Donald Trump taking the 
stage for one last laugh. With no 
debates left as comedic fodder, 
this week’s “SNL” focused on 

political commentary of Trump

SNL contemplates Trump, 
Clinton and Cumberfolk

MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

Benedict Cumberbatch hosts final episode before the election

open for an appeal for voters to 
get to the polls.

The sketch pushed Cecily 

Strong’s 
(“The 
Boss”) 
Erin 

Burnett 
together 
with 

McKinnon 
and 
Baldwin 

on 
her 
CNN 

news 
show, 

“OutFront.” 
Starting 
off 

strong, 
the 

sketch mocked 
Trump’s 
suspicious 
affiliations 
while Clinton was questioned 
over the ongoing investigation 
of her email scandal. After a 
brief interlude in which Trump 
pursed his lips for kisses coming 
from the likes of the FBI, 
KKK and Vladimir Putin and 
Clinton pleaded for America 
to reconsider our options, the 
camera panned out to Baldwin 
and McKinnon, alone on the 
stage. “I just hate yelling all this 
stuff at you like this,” Baldwin 
confessed, “Don’t you guys (the 
audience) feel gross all the time 
about 
this?” 
he 
questioned, 

turning to an audience that 
roared with laughter. The two 
held hands and dashed outside 
the Rainbow Room to join 
hands with Trump and Clinton 
supporters 
alike, 
returning 

not too long afterward to urge 
viewers to vote on Tuesday, 
regardless 
of 
the 
candidate 

they’re supporting.

One of the more noticeable 

and planned breaks in character 
for the series, the cold open 
succeeds in focusing on the 
exhausting 
controversies 

brought on by both candidates 
during the presidential race. 
McKinnon portrays Clinton as 
deeply exasperated, with her 

concerns 
over 

the 
election 

closing in and 
the 
closeness 

of 
the 
race 

showing 
through in the 
sketch.

Benedict 

Cumberbatch 
(“Sherlock”) 
hosted 
— 
a 

first 
for 
the 

40-year-old British actor, who 
is fresh off of the Marvel film 
“Dr. 
Strange” 
— 
alongside 

musical guest Solange. In an 
excellent counterpoint to his 
stereotyped intellectual roles, 
Cumberbatch showed the silly 
side that he is known for during 
personal interviews and off-the-
record taping sessions. Playing 
characters such as an emo British 
magician (obviously a play on 
Criss Angel) and a construction 
worker-turned-male stripper à 
la “Weekend at Bernie’s” style, 
Cumberbatch pulled his comedic 
side out for the camera. From 
an Apple iToilet advertisement 
modeled after the 1984 Mac 
commercial to another hilarious 
sketch, a game show titled “Why 
is Benedict Cumberbatch Hot?,” 
Cumberbatch 
explored 
his 

sexuality within his fan base, 
the self-titled “Cumberbitches” 
— a fact that Cumberbatch 
makes sure to clarify in his 
opening monologue. “Can’t they 
be 
Cumberfolk?” 
The 
game 

show in particular showed off 
Cumberbatch’s 
modesty, 
as 

Aidy Bryant (“Brother Nature”), 
Vanessa Bayer (“Trainwreck”) 
and 
Cumberbatch 
played 

contestants left to ponder the 
long-questioned mystery — why 
exactly is Benedict Cumberbatch 
hot? The answer — nobody 
really knows. Maybe it’s the 
hammerhead shark look.

Emmy 
winning 
comedian 

and “SNL” alum Dana Carvey 
returned as the “Church Lady” 
for Weekend Update, coming 
after Donald Trump in this 
sketch. Belligerently pushing Jost 
to accept his homosexuality and 
to spend his nights away from 
the criticism of social media, the 
church lady played on the material 
that has been surging around 

Trump’s Twitter account since his 
presidential run announcement. 
On a more lighthearted note, 
“SNL” alum Bill Murray also 
returned to the screen to root on 
the Chicago Cubs, following their 
recent World Series win against 
the Cleveland Indians. Overall, 
balancing the comedy standard 
of “SNL” during an election year 
with the cast’s more serious notes 
regarding the fast-approaching 
decision day was a daring move 
by “SNL” — but it certainly paid 
off in the end with McKinnon and 
Baldwin in the lead.

“Why is Benedict 

Cumberbatch 

hot?” a game show 

asks.

O

n October 27, Twitter 
announced that they 
would be discontinuing 

one of its most popular and 
universal 
apps: 
Vine. 
While 

the 
company 
said 

that they will keep 
existing Vine videos 
for archival purposes, 
users will no longer 
be able to create six-
second looped clips. 
For those who don’t 
use Vine or are not 
particularly familiar 
with the app, this 
may not be relevant 
news at all. But for 
those who do use it, 
the death of Vine is an immense 
tragedy.

Since 
that 
fateful 

announcement, Vine users have 
been mourning the loss of the app. 
To commemorate Vine’s legacy, 
popular Viners, such as chloe lmao 
(920.4k followers) have, generated 
specialized remakes of the Vines 
that made them viral. They’re also 
changing their usernames to their 
Instagram and Twitter accounts, 
hoping that their followers will 
continue to interact with them, 
post-Vine mortem. Other popular 
Viners, like leathershirts (311.3k 
followers), 
GETTER 
(396k 

followers) and J. Cyrus (1.5 million 
followers) showcased their sense 
of dread for Vine’s ending with 
comically dark clips. Users have 
also created mini montages of 
viral Vines and reposted old viral 
Vines for nostalgia’s sake.

It’s strange and sad to think 

that an app that has given so much 
joy to so many people will soon 
be gone. But what was it about 
Vine that made it so special? Was 
it having the ability to produce 
memes at a remarkably rapid 
pace? Or was it the physical and 
virtual community it formed 
among the app’s active content 
creators? 

Despite all of its flaws and 

detractors, 
Vine 
possesses 
a 

myriad of wonderful qualities. 
During its first month of activity 
in January 2013, BBC News 
called Vine “mesmerizing” and 
a “bewildering carousel of six-
second slices of ordinary life rolls 
past.” But since then, the app has 
become a triumphant achievement 
in online creativity, encouraging 
tech-savvy millennials to go out 
and make their own content on 
their mobile devices.

The app’s hook of recording 

something under six seconds 
may have been daunting at first, 
but the six-second limit ended 

up cultivating a plethora of 
videos that were a combination 
of surreal, hilarious, iconic and 
singular. With the right music, 
editing, 
setting, 
acting 
and 

timing, Vine could 
make anything seem 
possible.

Users would mash 

up pop music with 
infamous 
scenes 

from TV and film, 
incorporate 
hip 

hop into awkward 
situations 
and 

synchronized dance 
routines, capture cool 
moments 
in 
slow-

motion and poke fun 

at current dance trends. Vine also 
created its own vernacular that 
would bewilder any baby boomer 
or Gen-Xer, producing phrases 
like “A potato flew around my 
room,” “Suh dude,” “Do you gotta 
bae or nah?” “Do it for the Vine” 
and “Eyebrows on fleek.”

Like its video counterpart 

YouTube and its parent company 
Twitter, 
Vine 
provided 
a 

landscape 
for 
today’s 
youth 

to integrate pop culture with 
comedy, shed light on national 
issues through relatable content 
and 
— 
most 
importantly 
— 

connect with one another through 
an online, globalized community, 
all within six seconds.

In addition to all that, Vine 

was a major source in making 
talented (and even untalented) 
people famous. Andrew “King 
Bach” 
Bachelor 
(16.2 
million 

followers) was one of the first 
Viners who gained an enormous 
amount of popularity. Most of his 
Vines, which garnered thousands 
of likes and revines, were filled 
with racially tinged humor and 
funny catchphrases like “But 
that backflip tho.” Though he 
is currently the most followed 
person on Vine, Bachelor is now 
an established online personality, 
having taken his Vine fame and 
put it to good use on Instagram, 
YouTube and even film and TV. 
He starred in the Wayan Brothers 
parody film “Fifty Shades of 
Black” last January and had a 
guest spot in Joe Swanberg’s 
Netflix anthology series “Easy.”

Even if Bachelor and his 

other Vine compadres may not 
be everyone’s cup of tea — they 
mostly perpetuated and satirized 
racial stereotypes in their Vines 
— it still goes to show how much 
power Vine obtained as a tool for 
stardom. 
Previously 
unknown 

musicians Bobby Shmurda and 
Shawn Mendes received record 

deals after Vines of their work 
(Shmurda’s “Hot N****a” and 
Mendes’ renditions of pop jingles) 
became viral. Songs that already 
existed, such as OG Maco’s “U 
Guessed It,” Chedda Da Connect’s 
“Flicka Da Wrist” and T-Wayne’s 
“Nasty Freestyle,” also became 
well-known after Vine users 
popularized them. Essentially, 
Vine 
recognized 
voices 
that 

would have otherwise not been 
seen or heard by social media 
users, paving the way for artists to 
express their creative selves.

Vine also encouraged people 

to infuse the medium with social 
commentary. 
For 
example, 

the app became a huge part 
of documenting the Ferguson 
protests in 2014. Recorded Vines 
of the protests helped catalyze a 
national conversation on police 
brutality after police shot and 
killed Michael Brown. Had Vine 
not existed or reached the peak 
of its popularity at that time, 
Ferguson’s 
social 
significance 

would have been much more 
diluted.

Why, then, has Twitter decided 

to take away Vine from its loyal 
followers? The reasons given 
for Vine’s demise are varied, 
including a decline in the app’s 
popularity and changes in the 
company’s goals. But perhaps 
the main reason could be that 
Viners have outgrown Vine. Most 
of the app’s bad aspects involve 
vapid imitators who aggressively 
replicate trends in a deceptively 
simple and unoriginal way. Users 
also tend to make Vines that 
require a minimal amount of 
work. This pertains specifically to 
condensed Vines that use scenes 
from TV shows and movies with 
the addition of a few visual or 
audio changes for comic effect. 
Sometimes, they would make for 
clever Vines, but mostly they fail 
to capture what made Vine so 
good in the first place. 

Regardless 
of 
its 
defects, 

though, Vine will be forever 
missed. It gave our generation an 
accessible, short-form platform 
of entertainment, a place to 
joke around and express our 
individuality through the ever-
growing medium of social media. 
Until Twitter announces the app’s 
official death date, at least we can 
continue to watch and laugh at 
our favorite Vines loop endlessly 
until there’s nothing left to fill the 
existential void of reality.

A eulogy for Vine

Fashion, with its air of magic 

and 
enchantment, 
has 
long 

fashioned 
fairy 
godmothers 

of its own — Coco Chanel and 
Miuccia Prada in particular 
come to mind. But Christian 
Dior, 
equally 
iconic 
and 

unforgettable, 
stands 
one 

of 
fashion’s 
greatest 
fairy 

godfathers.

In 2014, the Tribeca Film 

Festival 
released 
Frederic 

Tcheng’s 
(“Diana 
Vreeland: 

The 
Eye 
Has 
to 
Travel”) 

documentary “Dior and I” to 
illustrate the continuation of 
Christian Dior’s legacy through 
the eyes of new creative director 
Raf Simons. The film is mostly 
in French but utilizes English 
subtitling.

The opening presents the tall, 

intimate and quintessentially 
French character of Christian 
Dior, 
followed 
by 
the 
less 

abstract, charming and shy 
figure of Raf Simons. Simons 
and his team face the priceless 
privilege and daunting pressure 
of carrying out Dior’s particular 
brand of craft, to create a 

breathtaking collection in mere 
weeks.

Faced with every imaginable 

obstacle in the business, the 
team faces crippling challenges 
but triumphs by the skin of their 
teeth. The show goes underway 
and 
achieves 
overwhelming 

success, especially in harkening 
back to days of classic haute 
couture.

Tcheng gives his viewers 

an exclusive look into the 
mechanics of bringing such 
art to life, only hinted at in the 
layers of tulle and hand stitching 
floating down the runway. Each 
of the team members has their 
own snippet of the film, a chance 
to comment on their own role 
in the process while running 
around to finish the day’s work.

But the chaos, stress, and 

scramble of putting together 
the 
modern 
collection 
are 

juxtaposed by shadowy intervals 
of Dior’s history. Women dressed 
in vintage Dior framed in black 
and white cinematography swirl 
to Christian Dior’s soft, alluring 
voice.

The film does two things 

admirably. 
Primarily, 

almost akin to the feeling of 
desperate hope inspired by an 

inspirational sports movie, the 
audience is breathlessly rooting 
for Simon, and his team to win 
the metaphorical trophy of high 
fashion approval. While they 
pray to the spirit of Christian 
Dior, the audience is praying for 
the flustered seamstresses and 
the nearly faint Simons.

Secondly, the film resurrects 

the 
word 
“sublime.” 
Every 

stroke 
of 
genius, 
fortunate 

moment or execution of another 
piece is marked by someone’s 
proclamation of “sublime!”(in 
a perfect French accent, of 
course) making us wonder why 
anyone ever stopped saying that 
word.

The film reminds us why we 

find ourselves so fascinated by 
fashion. “Dior and I” bestows 
a glimpse into the raw vision 
that is molded by blood, sweat 
and tears in order to make true 
couture. And more than any 
sports team, the house of Dior’s 
teamwork behind the scenes 
was 
unparalleled 
and 
awe-

inspiring. Much like the work it 
displays, the film is sublime in 
its portraiture and reminds us 
why Dior will continue to mark 
the pages of Vogue for years to 
come.

Look at alllllll that #content.

“XOXO,” a film set at an 

electronic dance music festival, 
tells the story å six strangers 
who float in and out of each 
other’s music fest 
experiences. 
Just 

like an EDM fest in 
real life, there are 
too many flashing 
neon 
lights, 
too 

many people doing 
too many drugs and 
an aggressively bro-
ey crowd. But to say 
there is a real plot 
or character development would 
certainly be an overstatement.

Most suprisingly, “XOXO” is 

one of the recent productions put 
out by Netflix as original content. 
For the most part, Netflix has 
put out middling to high quality 
original content ranging from 
likes of Tallulah” to “Beasts of 
No Nation”. Recently, however, 
there seems to have been a 
lowering of the bar as exemplified 
by “Crouching Tiger, Hidden 
Dragon: Sword of Destiny,” “The 
Ridiculous 6” and most recently, 
the underwhelming “XOXO.”

In the film, Ethan (Graham 

Parker, “The Good Wife”) has 
recently had his new single, 
featuring vocals from his mom, 
go viral on YouTube. His best 
friend and manager, Tariq (Brett 
DelBuono, “Let Me In”), books 
him a spot at XOXO, a music 
festival that spans less than 12 
hours. From there on out the 
movie primarily consists of EDM 
intercut with shots of women’s 

cleavage. That’s about it. Ethan 
has trouble getting into the 
festival because his manager 
hasn’t made proper arrangements 
for him. Tariq gets held up 
working at his father’s restaurant. 
But when Tariq finally arrives at 
the festival, he ends up making 

out with a scantily 
clad 
woman 

who he finds out 
had acid on her 
tongue. 
Many 

more 
shots 
of 

characters kissing 
women 
wearing 

few 
articles 
of 

clothing and ass 
shots follow. The 

movie indulges the viewer in the 
excess of EDM culture without he 
or she having to attend an actual 
event.

“XOXO” is voyeuristic in how 

it looks at the EDM subculture. 
Screenwriter 
and 
director 

Christopher 
Louie 
(“Lucky”) 

doesn’t leave much room for 
critical thought or exploration 
of the culture it presents. This is 
not to say that people shouldn’t 
be able to act, dress and party the 
way they want to, but rather that 
the way it should be presented 
in a film is a critical and artistic 
choice. “XOXO” reduces other 
aspects of EDM culture and 
affirms that there is only one 
acceptable 
behavior. 
When 

Kyrstal (Sarah Hyland, “Modern 
Family”) is getting ready for the 
festival, she puts on an outfit but 
is told by her friends that it isn’t 
sexy and revealing enough. She 
succumbs to peer pressure and 
changes. Although there is an 
obvious questioning by Krystal, 

the movie ultimately presents 
peer pressure as acceptable. 
At another point in the film, a 
group of “bros” want to beat up 
a character, but are convinced by 
a tripping Tariq that they need 
to be happy and loving and all 
end up dancing together. There 
are clear attempts to show the 
misinformed actions of certain 
characters, but no character 
is developed enough to lend 
the feeling that they learned 
something and their behavior 
will permanently changed. The 
troubling thing is it seems Netflix 
is OK with putting out this kind 
of low-quality content.

There is no doubt that movies 

like this have long been made 
and will continue to be made. 
There will always be a place for 
B-grade movies, and there should 
be. They can be fun, entertaining 
and enjoyable in a way that more 
serious works simply can’t be. 
Using tropes and stereotypes 
that people have seen so much 
they know them by heart is part 
of the fun of the B-movie, yet it 
doesn’t seem that Netflix should 
be the company producing and 
distributing movies of this sort. 
The 
company 
should 
more 

carefully choose the original 
movies it puts out and think about 
how they reflect the company. 
The Netflix banner at one point 
denoted a show or a movie you 
could expect to be good, but now 
this doesn’t seem to be the case. 
Netflix shouldn’t demean itself 
or its audience by producing 
movies like “XOXO” that only 
use stereotypical characters and 
erotic images to engage their 
audience.

Wagner seeks breakout year

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team hopes it can look 
back at summer 2016 as not only 
one of the healthiest summers in 
recent memory, but also as “The 
Summer of Mo.”

By the end of the 2015-16 

season, 
sophomore 
forward 

Moritz Wagner was beginning 
to break through and make 
an impact for the Wolverines. 
His eight-rebound, four-block 
performance against Tulsa in 
the NCAA First Four helped 
Michigan into the next round of 
the NCAA Tournament.

In the win over the Golden 

Hurricane, Wagner displayed 
he had the talent to lead the 
Wolverines at the post for 
seasons to come. But there was 
still much he had to work on.

Wagner showed he was having 

a tough time adjusting to the 
physicality of college basketball 
compared to what he experienced 
playing in Germany. The forward 
was getting into foul trouble too 
often and knew he needed to be 
stronger to find any sort of success 
in the college game.

So, Wagner decided it was 

essential for him to spend his 
summer months in Ann Arbor, 
focusing on strengthening himself 
and all aspects of his game.

And on Friday, in Michigan’s 

exhibition against Armstrong 
State, Wagner began delivering 
the fruits of his labor.

In 25 minutes, the sophomore 

was 7-for-9 from the floor, 
scoring 15 points while grabbing 
two rebounds. It didn’t matter 
that the Pirates were a lowly 
Division II team — Wagner 
was still making intelligent and 
confident plays.

He wasn’t perfect in the 

exhibition, still struggling in 
some areas of rebounding, but it 
seems Wagner has come out of 
the summer as the Wolverines’ 
most improved player and will 

likely open up Michigan to 
more options offensively as the 
season begins.

“(Wagner’s) going to have to 

get out there,” said Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein. 
“His 

defense is better, and he stayed 
out of foul trouble. He really 
understands 
that. 
The 
big 

thing is right now, we think he 
can take a lot of guys his size 
off the bounce. … You can play 
through him.”

In past seasons, several of 

Beilein’s most prolific players 
have made huge leaps between 
their freshman and sophomore 
years. After spending hours 
in the gym like Wagner, past 
guards Trey Burke and Nik 
Stauskas 
went 
from 
above-

average Big Ten talents to NBA 
lottery picks.

But Beilein’s greatest hits have 

always been in the backcourt.

Former Michigan forwards 

Glenn 
Robinson 
III 
and 

Jordan Morgan saw decreased 

production in rebounds and 
points per game, respectively, 
between their first and second 
seasons, while Mitch McGary’s 
sophomore year was cut short 
due to an injury.

But some changes may lead to 

Wagner breaking the trend.

Changes on Beilein’s staff may 

create the right conditions for a 
frontcourt player to finally break 
through. New assistant coaches 
Saddi Washington and Billy 
Donlon bring expertise in post 
and defensive play that Michigan 
hasn’t had in years past.

Wagner 
also 
brings 
a 

mentality completely different 
from 
the 
Wolverines’ 
past 

forward 
talents. 
Coming 

from Germany, Wagner had 
to simultaneously adjust to 
playing 
American 
college 

basketball 
and 
living 
an 

American college life. He also 
had the extra hurdle last year of 
overcoming cultural and even 
language gaps that no other 

player under Beilein has gone 
through. For Wagner, spending 
the summer in Ann Arbor was 
as much about learning more 
about Michigan culture as it 
was about Michigan basketball.

“I didn’t realize it last year,” 

Wagner said. “But now that I’m 
here, I realize it’s easier to focus 
if you know what to expect and 
don’t ask yourself what’s coming 
and what’s next.”

Despite his struggles last 

season, 
Wagner 
still 
had 

flashes of his true ability that 
broke through, including the 
tournament game against Tulsa 
and a 19-point outing versus 
Charlotte. He’s hoping his work 
over the summer can lead to 
more consistency in being able 
to perform at that level.

“I feel very good right now,” 

Wagner said. “I wasn’t confident 
there when I didn’t play a lot, 
but in practice I always try and 
keep it as high as possible. That 
doesn’t really change a lot.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Freshmen adjust well 
in first career game

A high school gym is much 

different than Crisler Center. 
Understandably, 
the 
TV 

coverage, brighter lights and 
sizable crowd induce nerves into 
freshmen who are gearing up for 
their first season.

But for seasoned players like 

junior guard Jillian Dunston, 
Crisler is the norm.

“I didn’t say anything to (the 

freshmen) 
before 
the 
game 

because 
their 
nerves 
were 

inevitable,” Dunston said. “But 
afterwards I just said, ‘Welcome 
to college basketball.’ ”

The goal of the upperclassmen’s 

relationship with the new players, 
according to sophomore guard 
Nicole Munger, is to keep them 
positive. Especially for Munger 
and the rest of the sophomore 
class, they’re well aware of how 
intimidating freshman year is. 

When the freshmen on the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team returned to their locker 
room 
after 
the 
Wolverines’ 

exhibition game against Wayne 
State on Thursday, they were able 
to finally know what it’s like to 
play for the Wolverines. 

The freshman class consists of 

guards Kysre Gondrezick, Kayla 
Robbins and Akienreh Johnson, 
as well as forward KeAsja Peace. 
In the 93-41 domination of the 
Warriors, all four were able to see 
some playing time, with Johnson 
making a definite statement in 
just eight minutes on the court. 

Johnson, who committed to 

Michigan almost four years ago 
— a Wolverine longer than some 
upperclassmen — scored a total of 
three points and garnered three 
rebounds. Her rebounds in the 
second half helped her teammates 
erase a somewhat disappointing 
first half in which Wayne State 
and Michigan were neck and neck. 

Gondrezick, on the other hand, 

didn’t perform her free throws 
like she had been in practices, but 
the Wolverines aren’t concerned.

“She’s played pretty consistently 

up to this point,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “I think 
she pressed a bit (on Thursday) and 
I think that’s probably a common 
thing for a freshman when they 
get an opportunity to get out on 
the court.

“Kysre is going to be a special 

player for us. But I think any 
time you have a local kid that’s a 
superstar, there’s a tremendous 
amount of pressure. She’s a far 
better player than everybody saw 
(on Thursday). I’m not worried 
about her. She just needs to let the 
game come to her sometimes. I’m 
confident that she will.” 

Robbins scored two points for 

Michigan in field goals, but like 
Gondrezick, 
underperformed 

in her free throws. Peace went 
1-for-4 in free throws to round 
out the freshmen’s contributions. 

Part of the nerves — and 

excitement — for the freshmen 
came from being able to put 
on the Michigan uniform and 
compete in it. In her pre-game 
speech, Barnes Arico made sure 
to emphasize the honor of being 
able to defend the block ‘M’. 

Though the freshmen may 

not have played up to their own 
expectations, 
Barnes 
Arico 

wanted them to know that the 
Wayne State exhibition game was 
just the beginning. 

“(Their 
performance) 
was 

unbelievable,” Barnes Arico said. 
“There are local kids and they 
had their family and their fan 
section here tonight and they’ve 
been waiting to just get out there 
to get on that court. 

“They’ve been watching for 

years other players come and play 
before them. For them to get out 
there was an exciting opportunity 
to get in and contribute.”

WOMEN’S GOLF
Wolverines win rain-
shortened tournament

The 
tournament 
didn’t 

play out exactly the way it 
anticipated, but the Michigan 
women’s golf team took home 
the victory at the Trinity Forest 
Invitational in Dallas in its last 
tournament of the fall season.

The 
14-team 
tournament, 

which was hosted by Southern 
Methodist 
University, 
was 

originally a 54-hole competition 
set to be played on Monday and 
Tuesday. But due to heavy rain, 
the tournament ended up being 
cut short after just 18 holes.

In Monday’s first round, the 

Wolverines made it to the 11th 
hole before the rain forced them 
into the clubhouse. Two hours 
later, they were back on the 
course, and by the end of the 
round, they found themselves 
with a score of 304 and a one-
stroke lead over Texas A&M.

Rain canceled the second 

round that was also scheduled 
to be played that day, and in the 
morning, the Wolverines found 
out the final round would be 
called off as well, giving them 
their first team title since 2012.

While the Wolverines were 

disappointed that they weren’t 
able to play a full tournament, 
coach Jan Dowling was quick 
to point out the positives from 
their performance.

“We put ourselves in a great 

position going into the final 
round,” Dowling said. “It would 
have been a really fun and really 
competitive 
experience 
for 

our program, but at the same 
time, we have to give credit to 
our round that was played. We 
played well in tough conditions, 
and we beat a lot of good teams.”

Michigan was powered by 

sophomore Elodie Van Dievoet 
and junior Emily White, both of 
whom posted scores of 75 (plus-
3) to finish tied for sixth place, 

four strokes back of the winner. 
Juniors Megan Kim and Kathy 
Lim were two strokes behind 
them, tying for 20th.

The weather wasn’t the only 

factor that had a substantial 
impact 
on 
the 
Wolverines’ 

performance on Monday. Trinity 
Forest Country Club, a newly 
built seaside links-style course 
with no trees, was already one 
of the most challenging courses 
the Wolverines had experienced 
all year. In particular, Dowling 
mentioned the greens, which 
despite the rain remained hard 
and fast.

“They’re huge greens, and 

because it’s a very new course, 
they were really, really firm,” 
Dowling said. “You’re landing 
your ball on a flat area or a 
downslope, and the ball almost 
100 percent of the time rolls to 
the back of the green.”

However, Dowling believes 

that this apparent disadvantage 
actually 
worked 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ favor, as it allowed 
them to strategize more and 
rely more on mental attributes.

“You really had to plot your 

way around the golf course, 
almost like you had to think one 
or two shots ahead,” Dowling 
said. “It became a chess game, 
which played into our favor.”

With the fall season over, 

Michigan has a three-month 
break before its next tournament, 
the Lady Puerto Rico Classic in 
February. During this time away 
from competition, the Wolverines 
will be motivated to build on the 
momentum from their victory as 
they prepare for the second half 
of their campaign.

“The 
players 
have 
some 

individual things they need 
to work on, and we’re excited 
to attack them at the right 
time,” Dowling said. “It’s a 
great confidence booster and 
motivator for us heading into 
the spring.”

Marody putting in extra work during absence

He 
may 
not 
be 
making 

an impact on the ice during 
games because of an academic 
suspension, but Cooper Marody 
still manages to contribute for 
the No. 17 Michigan hockey team.

While the stat sheet was once 

filled with his own scores in the 
goal column, the sophomore 
center now keeps tabs of his 
teammates’ chances as he sits 
on the bench with the coaching 
staff during games.

“Particularly 
during 
the 

games, in the weekend, we’ll 
give him something to do and 
then he can get back to us in 
between periods as to what he 
sees,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “Because he’s a center, 
I want him to be dialed in on 
faceoffs. We’ve had him critique 
our power play as well. We try 
to keep his head into the games, 
especially the home games.”

This 
weekend, 
as 
the 

Wolverines take on No. 4 
Boston University, Marody will 
have the chance to spend time 
with his teammates on game 
day again — something he was 
unable to do the past two weeks 
because he is prohibited from 
traveling. He will resume his 
typical duties of stat-tracking at 
Yost Ice Arena, though.

Last week, he took advantage of 

the team’s early departure. While 
his team prepared its gameplan 
in Tempe, Ariz., Marody skated 
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday mornings.

Six weeks remain before 

Marody can put on the new 
Nike maize-and-blue sweater 
for the first time. For now, 
though, he continues to push 
himself in practices. Mornings 
when he doesn’t have class, 
he will work out in the weight 
room, oftentimes by himself 
— something that Berenson 
and Marody’s fellow players 
recognize.

“The only thing he can do 

right now is work hard in 
practice,” said senior goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort. “He can make 
the guys better in practice by 
playing his hardest, working 

hard every single rep. That’s 
where he’s going to be able to 
make a difference to this team 
right now.”

Added junior forward Tony 

Calderone: “He knows he can’t 
play. But, he’s in the gym every 
day, being a positive influence, 
trying to make everyone better. 
Playing against a guy like that 
in practice will make you better 
(because) you’re playing against 
guys like that all the time in 
games. I think he’s making 
everyone 
better 
out 
there. 

(Marody’s a) very skilled player, 
and it’s very cool to watch him 
out there.”

When Marody practices, his 

physical skills on the ice become 
obvious. He shows his ability to 
shoot the puck from all across 
the ice and continues to improve 
his 
skate 
speed. 
According 

to 
Berenson, 
Marody’s 

skills separate him from his 
teammates, as he focuses on 
developing his skating, puck 
touches and strength.

“Certain 
times, 
he’ll 
get 

the puck and he’ll score from 
anywhere,” Berenson said. “He 
knows how to score. He can be 
a special player with the puck. 
We all wish he was playing, (but 
he’s) taking advantage of the 
practices, (and putting in) extra 
work in the weight room.”

The time off the ice during 

games 
allowed 
Marody 
to 

focus on becoming a mentor for 
the younger players. He may 
be just a sophomore, but on a 
young Michigan 
team, his year 
of 
experience 

could 
prove 

invaluable.

Marody 

endured 
some 

highs last year 
— like scoring 
a goal in four 
straight games, 
including 
the 

game-winner 
against Niagara last November 
— and some unfortunate lows, 
like missing six games due to 
mononucleosis.

“He played a big role last 

year,” Calderone said. “He can 
give all his advice to those guys, 

the younger guys. Spreading 
(his) knowledge and experience 
that he had will be helpful to the 
younger guys.”

Added Berenson: “(His role 

is) to be a good teammate. To 
be a good mentor for the young 
players, especially. For our team 
as a whole, push other guys 

in 
practice 
so 

that he’s trying 
to make them 
better 
so 
our 

team 
will 
be 

better.”

It is unclear 

which 
line 

Marody 
will 

join 
once 
he 

returns in late 
December 
for 

the Great Lakes 

Invitational. 
In 
practices, 

Marody pairs up with players 
who are not normally a part of 
the regular line chart, like junior 
forward Alex Talcott and — 
before he returned from his own 
suspension — freshman forward 

Adam Winborg. Marody has 
not yet played with first-line 
players like senior Alex Kile 
and freshman Will Lockwood, 
or even his former line partner 
Calderone. This will happen 
in the week before he returns, 
according to Berenson. 

When Marody returns for 

the puck drop against Michigan 
Tech on Dec. 29, he is sure to 
have an instant effect.

“He has a chance to make 

an impact on our team when 
he comes back,” Berenson said. 
“He’s had a chance to watch 
games, but he hasn’t played 
them. It’s one thing to watch, 
another thing to play, but I still 
think he’s got the pulse of the 
team and he knows what he has 
to do to be an impact player. 
He’ll get the chance, and all this 
work should pay off the minute 
that he plays his first game.”

And maybe the next time he 

looks at a stat sheet, he’ll see his 
name alongside his teammates 
in the goal column again.

Calmer Speight wins Harbaugh over

Coming into fall camp a year 

ago, Wilton Speight was pretty 
sure he was never going to be 
Jim Harbaugh’s quarterback — 
and it wasn’t just because he’s 
allergic to milk.

In the new coach’s first spring 

camp in 2015, Speight struggled 
through four-hour practices, 
took 
expletive-filled 
tongue-

lashings from Harbaugh and 
found himself buried on the 
depth chart. Heading into the 
fall, the then-redshirt freshman 
had had enough.

“I was on the phone with my 

parents, basically saying, ‘OK, 
I’m out. Let’s find a different 
school,’ ” Speight said.

Speight had his parents reach 

out to other colleges — North 
Carolina State emerged as an 
early favorite because of some 
family ties there — and he was 
dead-set on leaving Ann Arbor. 
He told some of his teammates 
he was leaving, including his 
camp roommate, then-redshirt 
freshman 
receiver 
Drake 

Harris, and he planned to go to 
Harbaugh’s office the first week 
of camp and tell him the same.

On the morning Speight woke 

up to do it, though, Harris asked 
him, “Are you sure?”

Speight wasn’t. He never 

made it to Harbaugh’s office, and 
he ended up playing through the 
rest of camp.

He 
ultimately 
won 
the 

second-string job, and the rest 
is history. A season later, he is 
the starting quarterback for the 
third-ranked, 9-0 Wolverines 
and has thrown 15 touchdowns 
and just three interceptions.

If there was any lingering 

doubt 
about 
Speight 
from 

Harbaugh, 
the 
second-year 

coach shattered it in a press 
conference 
the 
Monday 

following Michigan’s win over 
Michigan State last week.

“I think we’re looking at a 

budding — really good player,” 
Harbaugh said. “I almost said 
‘budding star.’ I mean, it’s 
really close to that. He’s doing 
so many good things, and he’s 
been almost flawless, really, 
when he has time and space to 
see things.”

Now, Speight can look back 

at the exhausting practices 
and tough-love coaching and 
realize that he was getting 
tougher and stronger the whole 
time. That realization didn’t 
come to him until this spring, 
when he emerged as the clear 
frontrunner for the starting 
job over redshirt juniors John 
O’Korn and Shane Morris.

More 
importantly, 
he’s 

appeared calm on the field all 
season, which is a feat that 

hasn’t always come easy for 
him. Speight said he’s the type 
of person to break a paddle if he 
loses a ping-pong game. When 
he was younger, he would stop 
speaking to his mom if she beat 
him in a game 
of “HORSE” in 
their backyard.

But thanks to 

his high school 
basketball 
coach, 
who 

doubles 
as 
a 

“mindfulness 
teacher,” Speight 
has found a way 
to 
maintain 
a 

level head when 
he’s under center.

“I practiced a ton with him, 

almost like a meditation-type 

thing,” 
Speight 
said. 
“We 

figured out whenever I click my 
buckle in my helmet or lick my 
fingers before a snap, that kind 
of brings me back to this chill 
mode. In football, I feel like I’ve 

kind of mastered 
it, but I’m still 
working on the 
other stuff.”

That 

calmness 
has 

helped 
him 

improve 
every 

week. 
Multiple 

teammates, 
including fifth-
year 
senior 

offensive 

lineman Ben Braden on Tuesday 
night, have compared Speight’s 
trajectory to last year’s starter, 

Jake Rudock, who rode his late-
season success to become an 
NFL draft pick.

And 
finally, 
Speight 
has 

earned 
the 
endorsement 
of 

Harbaugh, 
who 
speculated 

that it might be time “to throw 
(Speight’s) hat in the ring” for 
Heisman Trophy consideration.

As for Speight’s milk allergy 

— which often forced his family 
to buy raw milk in a Whole 
Foods parking lot (“The cow’s 
name was Apple, if you guys 
were wondering,” he said) — he 
hasn’t told Harbaugh yet. After 
all, it was a long road to get on 
his coach’s good side.

“He just gets so into his milk 

brand and his whole milk and 
stuff,” Speight said. “I’ll let him 
have his whole milk.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight was once a long way from running the show, but he stuck around and became one of Michigan’s leaders.

Michigan’s defense facing struggles on edge

There’s 
not 
much 
the 

Michigan football team doesn’t 
do well on defense.

By 
now, 
the 
statistics 

have been well covered. The 
Wolverines are the best in the 
country in scoring defense, 
passing 
defense 
and 
total 

defense. 
They 
rarely 
allow 

teams to extend drives, much 
less score touchdowns.

So it was a bit of a surprise 

Saturday when Maryland was 
able to repeatedly exploit the 
same apparent weakness in the 
Wolverines’ defense.

“(Maryland 
coach 
DJ) 

Durkin, he was our (defensive 
coordinator) last year, and when 
he was here he felt as though we 
struggled with tempo and on the 
edges,” said redshirt sophomore 
linebacker Jabrill Peppers. “So 
we kind of thought that we were 
going to get a game plan similar to 
that. We didn’t know how much 
spread it was going to be and how 
open they were going to have us.”

Throughout 
the 
game, 

Maryland 
continuously 

attacked the edges when it 
needed a play. Sometimes it was 
on an outside rush. Other times 
it was a tunnel screen. Usually, 
it was effective — at least as 
effective as an offense can be 
while scoring just three points. 
But the low point total wasn’t 
necessarily indicative of how 
effective they were when using 
the screen game.

On the final play before 

halftime, wide receiver D.J. 
Moore took a screen 47 yards 
and looked bound for the end 
zone. But at the 1-yard line, 
redshirt junior linebacker Mike 
McCray was able to stop him 
short and preserve the shutout.

“Great effort can cancel out 

a lot of those things,” said fifth-
year senior defensive tackle Ryan 
Glasgow. “Clock ran out. That was 
a really big play for our defense, 
big stop by Mike and (senior 
safety) Dymonte (Thomas).”

The screen was the main factor 

that led the Wolverines to allow 
more passing yards (289) against 
the Terrapins than they had all 
season. Michigan’s vaunted pass 
defense was still highly effective 
in coverage, as evidenced by its 
six pass breakups and three sacks, 
but on screens, the dynamic was 
different.

The quarterback gets the 

ball out fast to avoid some of 

the pressure from the defensive 
line, and the cornerbacks are 
rarely close enough to break 
up the pass. That leaves the 
play’s outcome up to pursuit 
from defenders and blocking 
by the offense. And when it 
came to screens on Saturday, 
Maryland’s offense appeared to 
have the edge.

Peppers said the effectiveness 

of 
the 
screen 
was 
more 

about good play-calling from 
Maryland than it was any 
specific challenge inherent to 
the play. (“It’s not really tough 
to tackle,” he said.)

Glasgow even offered an 

antidote to the problem, simple 
as it may be.

“It’s just smelling a rat,” 

Glasgow said. “Someone getting 
in the way, causing a cutback 
and people hustling to the ball. 
That’s basically all. It comes 
down to effort.”

It’s a concept Michigan may 

be tested on soon. Even while the 
Wolverines run up blowout wins 
over Maryland, Rutgers and 
other Big Ten non-contenders, 
there are real threats still out 
there. Ohio State is plenty 
capable of running the same 
types of plays, and the Buckeyes 
would do so with significantly 

better talent.

There’s no reason to believe 

Michigan 
can’t 
correct 
the 

issue — earlier in the year, it 
had trouble in contain, but it 
worked out those kinks rather 
quickly. But still, the members 
of the Wolverines’ defense are 
cognizant of the urgency.

“We 
didn’t 
make 
the 

adjustment we needed to, and 
I feel like (we will) learn from 
that right now,” McCray said. 
“We’re going to improve on 
this game because we know 
they’re probably going to try 
to do the same thing. So we’re 
ready for it.”

Michigan’s defense had issues setting the edge Saturday against Maryland, giving up a season-high 289 passing yards even in an otherwise dominant performance.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 9, 2016


I 

was talking to a friend of mine about a recent episode 
of “This Is Us,” a show I’ve written about substantially 
in the past. She was telling me how she’s dreading the 

moment when the show goes off the cliff. It’s a general fear 
about the show not being able to maintain its quality over its 
run. My response, though, was why not trust the show to be 
good and enjoy it while it’s at its peak? Every TV show fades 
at least a little before it ends, but there are too many strong 
moments in great shows to not celebrate them.

The problem with this view is I sometimes end up spurned 

by TV that lost its quality over its run. Last summer, thinking 
about this phenomenon, I wrote about “Scandal.” At its best, 
the series ran like a runaway freight train, moving through 
story and plot twists at a breakneck pace. But this season, 
it seemed to run out of momentum and doubled down on 
boring stories and ideas that stopped surprising me. There 
were fleeting moments, but I kept wishing for more from it 
and for it to show me why I liked it in the first place.

That failure on the part of “Scandal” left a bitter taste in 

my mouth, but there were times when skepticism almost got 
the better of me in my viewing. My favorite show on the air 
right now is “Jane the Virgin.” If you read the logline at face 
value — “a virgin is accidentally artificially inseminated by 
another man’s sperm” — it sounds completely ridiculous. 
But I gave the show a chance, and I am so grateful I did. It’s 
one of the kindest, warmest and funniest shows on network 
TV right now, but if I had maintained my skepticism, I 
would never have stuck with it.

I think this sense of taking a chance on TV comes from an 

inherent sense of optimism from which I look at the world. 
I’ve always looked at situations with a sense of “why this 
will be good” rather than “how this can and will go wrong.” 
That’s just a part of who I am as a person, and, in this case, it 
extends to how I watch my TV.

To go back to “This Is Us” though, I can see why someone 

would be doubtful about its ability to continue on its path. It 
has a very high degree of difficulty for what it wants to do. 
But, for now, watching Sterling K. Brown, who’s so good in 
his role, and the family dynamics are enough for me to very 
much enjoy what I’m seeing.

At this point, I’ve reviewed dozens of shows and watched 

dozens of others. However, I don’t approach TV with the 
skepticism of a veteran TV watcher. I still try to give every 
new show a chance to prove itself before I write it off. 
Whether it’s a serialized drama or the most basic sitcom, 
there’s always the chance it will go off the rails, but why not 
try to give it a shot? Maybe I’m inherently optimistic, but 
there’s still every reason to enjoy something I like, without 
having to worry about when the experience will go bad.

ou could call me a socializing 
addict. I’m not an extrovert — 
though I am extroverted. I’m 

not an introvert — though I crave my 
alone time. I fall somewhere in the 
middle (I think many of us do), with a 
slight tilt on the extroverted side. The 
thing is, people are wonderful. And 
though I crave myself, people teach 
me about myself, and so I crave them 
all the more — their idiosyncrasies, 
foibles, hugs and shrugs. I have to be 
around it. I need to be around it. Some-
times I don’t even know why, and I sac-
rifice my own wellbeing for the high. 
Alack: addiction.

“Flavor of the Weak” — American 

Hi-Fi

The philosophy my mind has adopt-

ed these past three hazy years in Ann 
Arbor is that this is college, and this 

is the time for ballyhoo. When will my 
best friends and I be within a virtual 
arms-length of each other ever again? 
And in a bustling town with lights 
and clubs and people-filled streets all 
around us? And those sweaty, dark 
house parties and boxed wine and 
drunken conversation about the holi-
ness of “Stacy’s Mom” and other early-
2000s sonic relics? I can’t miss those 
things. I just can’t.

“Stacy’s Mom” — Fountains of 

Wayne

Right now, it’s a Friday night. I’m 

sitting in my room — in an apartment 
that houses six girls, five of whom have 
gone out — dead alone. And I’m trying 
my best to make it alive alone.

I just got off the Ferris wheel that 

was my craziest week of the semester: a 
huge English paper, an original sonnet 

and ekphrastic poem, five nights in a 
row of work, a photo shoot, a film to see 
and review, and smiles, endless smiles, 
to present to the world throughout it 
all. In essence, I am utterly exhausted, 
and a few hours ago I was making plans 
from my bed until I realized I literally 
could not get up from my bed. So I did 
something I most certainly never do: I 
sent my best friend a text that said I’d 
be taking a rain check for the night to 
lay low. Sorry. I love you. I’m so sorry. 
I owe you one.

“Sorry” — Simple Plan

Now what? I haven’t left my bed. 

Social media has given me all it could 
for the evening. I just pulled out the 
poems I wrote and discussed with 
my brilliant professor this morning, 
three classes and a pile of No Thai ago, 
though it feels like a lifetime. He loved 
the poems, and I teared up as he was 
complimenting me. Poetry is some-
thing I want to be good at. I recite them 
aloud in my room, as if I’m Dorothy 
Parker or Truman Capote at a reading. 
I’m in New York; I’m draped in pearls, 
a black turtleneck. I’ve got just enough 
age in my face to be respected, but 
enough youth left to be felt. People like 
my writing. People cheer after those 
last few lines.

“Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” 

— Good Charlotte

Oh, there’s my MC5 poster. I’m still 

in my room, and the Franzia is gone. 
I’ve still only written two good poems 
in my life, by other people’s standards.

There it is again: people. People are 

still plaguing my thoughts. How in the 
hell did Emily Dickinson do it? It was 
just her and her flowers and the immi-
nence of death. And J.D. Salinger? 
He didn’t leave his house for, what, 
50 years? What was there to do? To 
see? Ironically, in writing about these 
recluses, I am still writing about peo-
ple. Somebody stop me.

“In Too Deep” — Sum 41

OK, let me shavasana (a yoga position 

in which you lay on your back and do 
nothing) for a minute here. Just feel my 
heart beating. My hands and my head.

I am spectacularly alone, and I am 

writing. The only activity that — every 
single damn time — makes me feel sane. 
It’s my other favorite addiction. And I 
do feel sane right now. And thankful. 
And for the first time in a long time I 
don’t want anyone to come back to the 
apartment. I want to be here with my 
pen and diary and fingers and key-
board until I get it so right that I can’t 
hear applause anymore — I can just see 
the words in front of me.

nd so we drove, taking his way, the way he always 
takes, we always take, past the trees and fields that 
form, I imagine, the mental landscape of his child-
hood, a time lost and, with each passing, not quite 

regained. We drove past those fields, those trees, that granite sky, 
the ones we’ve always passed, the ones that haven’t changed. It was 
during the liminal season between winter and spring, when the 
snow cakes the grass. He sat in the driver’s seat — my dad, reticent, 
reserved, quiet in his familiar way, with a resignation that isn’t 
quite melancholy — navigating us through the roads in northern 
Michigan, where he grew up, served as the pastor of Grace Luther-
an Church and now spends his retirement. He was driving me back 
to school, like he usually does, to Ann Arbor, where I rarely leave 
now. We drove down Herron Road, the quickest way, he always 
says. Perhaps it is. I know no other.

And so we sat there, quietly, looking out our respective windows 

at the place he calls home, that I don’t, can’t. And so we sat there, 
just looking, and we let the silence grow.

***
A scar, somewhere between a foot and 18 inches in length, runs 

down my dad’s right leg. It’s a record of an irrevocable change. It’s 
from one of his first surgeries — he’s had eight now, I think, just on 
the lower extremities with hip replacements likely to come. It’s a 
mark that divides two times of his life: before his body was dam-
aged and after.

For my entire life and before it, my dad has suffered through var-

ious health problems. Right before I was born, when he was around 
35, there was an accident, the details of which are still ambiguous 
to me, that ravaged his joints and started a cycle of knee surgeries 
that ended with replacements for both. This accident, coupled with 
years of wear from playing baseball, weakened his joints. Eventu-
ally, sometime when I was in elementary school, he developed 
psoriatic arthritis, which not only inflames the joints but produces 
red lesions on the skin. I can’t remember when he didn’t have it. I 
can’t remember a time when his beard was without gray, when he 
walked without the tired rhythm of old age, when he didn’t seem 
old. It’s strange, even now, to name it, the arthritis, to articulate it 
as though it weren't the structuring condition of his life but a mere 
disease. It seems, rather, the very mark of his experience in the 
world, of my experience with him, of the man that I know.

When arthritis was all that plagued his body, my dad, stubborn 

and implacable, retained his independence. He still worked outside, 
cutting wood for the fires that heat our house and tinkering with 
this boat. But in recent years he’s suffered from a growing number 
of vertigo attacks and a nascent deafness. His independence wanes. 
He’s only 55, but his body bears the weight of a man of 70.

I have more diligence in our interactions than I once did, now, 

more of an awareness in his needs and discomforts. When he visits, 
we eat at the place closest to his parking spot, saving him the trou-
ble of a long walk. And I have the growing awareness that, perhaps 
sooner than later, he’ll need me to take care of him.

But when I was younger, I felt as though he and his body’s failure 

had robbed me of something, that because he wasn’t like the usual 
dad, which exists only in the mind of a child, that I was deprived of 
an essential aspect of my childhood.

***
I’ve always been a pastor’s son. It’s a moniker I’ve worn with 

bewilderment and, at times, disdain. I spent much of my childhood 
in church. I didn’t just attend services, after which old women 
would approach me and my mom, complimenting us on how 
handsome and intelligent a boy I was, squeezing my cheeks with 
wrinkled hands, but I’d also roam throughout while my dad was 
at work. I’d sit in his office while he wrote his sermons, his shelves 
lined with books, ancient texts and scriptures in German, ancient 
Greek and Hebrew. I remember sitting there, awed by his knowl-
edge, his apparent wisdom.

The church, however, never provided the moral and intellectual 

education for me that, it seems, it does for so many that attend. 
Church was often a place where I was hounded with attention and 
expectations I didn’t want. Whatever spiritual beliefs I may have 
developed, the social life that the church entailed pushed me away 
from it.

I’ve never known why my dad became a pastor nor understood 

it. But, I suspect, it has less to do with doctrine than its social mis-
sion. Most of his work was outside of the church. Many times, dur-
ing the week, he traveled to meet with parishioners, in hospitals 
most often, giving them communion. He worked with the people 
on the social periphery — the poor, the addicted, the forgotten 
people that populate a place like Alpena, our hometown. Chris-
tianity, preaching, isn’t so much a system through which he can 
arrange the world and make sense of its chaos but a place for moral 
action. Religion and the church, it seems, were a means by which 
he can take care of the world. For example, when our dog, Lucky, 
who I named and subsequently cursed, developed cancer and had 
his right front leg amputated, my dad made four-egg omelets and 
bacon every morning for him to help rebuild the tissue damaged in 
the operation. He’s dedicated his life to taking care of the world. 
The misery, then, of these accumulated ailments — the arthritis, 
the vertigo, the deafness — isn’t the just the pain they bring; it’s 
that he can no longer take care of the world because he can no lon-
ger take care of himself.

Body of the Father:

 Sifting through a changing relationship with my dad

BY KARL WILLIAMS, STATEMENT EDITOR

Besides the home, cars are the primary 

domestic space in my family, and it’s where my 
dad and I have shared the most time. In our 
home, with the exception of dinner, we rarely 
see each other. He has always been the driver 
in my family. My mom, though she has been 
driving for 40 years, can barely parallel park. 
He could do it blind.

My dad, who can’t sleep past the sunrise 

both because of habit and the stiff pain that 
sleep causes in his joints, used to drive me to 
school on most days and pick me up. I can’t 
remember, now, what happened during those 
or what we talked about — the Tigers, prob-
ably, or the Bush administration, which he 
hated as much as he loves the Tigers — but I 
remember the silences, the moments of shared 
solitude that formed our relationship.

Those silences, now, hold an anxiety that 

seems both new and inveterate. I feel guilty 
letting my dad drive me back to college. I have 
no idea if he will have an attack of vertigo 
while driving home alone, and I don’t want 
to be responsible for forcing him into one. As 
much as I know he probably wants to take me, 
it worries me that he’ll get an attack and be 
stranded on the highway. It worries me that, 
as he gets older, he won’t be able to take care 
of himself. It worries me that I won’t be there 
to help him.

And it worries him, now, that I won’t have 

a job when I graduate, that I’ll continue to rely 
on him and my mom, that I’ll remain depen-
dent. Our conversations turn without fail to 
the question of my life plans. “What are you 
doing after graduation?” he’ll ask me. “Fuck if I 
know,” I respond, and we end there and repeat 
for the next time. College is a swamp between 
adolescence and adulthood where one is stuck 
in the medial space between dependence and 
independence. And its end poses an unavoid-
able question: How do I take care of my dad 
when I haven’t even figured out how to take 
care of myself?

***
As fathers tend to do, my grandpa enjoys 

bragging about my dad. A star catcher on his 
high school baseball team, he could’ve gone 
pro, my grandpa tells me, not infrequently, in 
the way that the elderly repeat the stories that 
have solidified enough as to be easy to recall. 
He was the fastest kid in school, from kin-
dergarten through high school, I’m told. My 
grandpa had never seen anyone that fast. In 
the prime of his life, he says, my dad could pick 
up a 500-lb. car engine alone. It’s all bullshit, 
probably, or at least so altered by memory as 
to have erased enough of the truth to be clas-
sified as bullshit.

When I was younger, I used to assemble the 

spare details that fell through conversations 
with family, verbal artifacts at once vanished 
and resurrected, and imagine who he was 
before I was born. There’s a strangeness in 
this gap of memory, of imagination, in which 
the absence of an alternative life and the pos-
sibilities of what he once was linger. But I’ve 
never been able to mythologize, even in the 
benign way my grandpa does, who he once 
was. I can’t, even in a fiction, summon another 
vision of my dad as a star baseball player. He’s 
still the old man.

Then, there’s the intellectual. Somehow, 

my dad is intellectual without being snobbish 
in a place where education is itself a form of 
arrogance. In Alpena, a small town on the 
eastern coast of northern Michigan where we 
both grew up and where little has changed in 
the intervening decades between our youths, 
intellect, specifically intellectualism, is abnor-
mal. Once, as it was later told to me, a kid I 
knew in high school said to my friends that I 
was so smart it was like I was autistic.

My grandma once told me, furtively, with 

an admonishment that he wouldn’t want me to 
know, a story about a night my dad went miss-
ing. My grandpa woke up one morning when 
the sun was rising, like always, to begin work 
on the farm, and went to wake my dad up. He 
wasn’t in his bed. After searching across the 
farm, my grandpa found him near the out-
skirts of their farm, lying in the grass with a 
flashlight and a Bible.

To be intellectual, to have interests outside 

of that small sphere of rural experience — 
especially as a male — was, is a transgression. 
I remember, in 10th grade, reading “Hamlet” 
in the secrecy of my grandparents’ guest room, 
because I knew, know still, that if my friends 
found out they’d call me a faggot, or a queer, 
or one of the other dozens of epithets that cir-
culated through my high school’s walls. There 
was, is, a shame in reading, in learning.

It always seemed strange, somewhat incon-

ceivable, then, why my dad decided to — why 
he even wanted to — preach there. The name, 
the word itself, Alpena, cannot leave my 
tongue without a taste of contempt, of rejec-
tion. When I was in high school, I resented my 
parents’ choice to live there, to have me live 
there. I spent most of 10th grade petitioning 
them to send me to private school somewhere, 
anywhere. It’s a place antithetical to my val-
ues, to my being, which was formed, of course, 
by its opposition to my hometown. Reading 
and my interests, weren’t developed out of 
some passion within me, but from the environ-
ment without. More than my mom, I blamed 
my dad for this, for being born in a place that 
I grew to hate, in a home that was alien to me. 
Reading, learning, was a method of defiance to 
the people I grew up with. I did it out of arro-
gance and alienation, out of a sense that I was 
better than them.

But I think, now, of that story my grandma 

told me, of that night in the Bible, and I real-
ize now how much, like myself, he needed the 
intensity of that private mental space, of learn-
ing, of wrestling with the ambiguities outside 
of that small, simple, formative town.

***
Two scars run down my left leg, each, per-

haps, six inches long. They’re from my first 
surgery, one of few, from when I was hit by a 
car and broke both of my legs and my left pel-
vis. I was 4. I hadn’t even gone to school yet. A 
year before, in daycare, I was playing tag in the 
woods and tripped whereupon a stick on the 
ground struck through my skin right under-
neath my left eyeball. From an early age I had 
a keen ability for self-destruction. After my car 
accident, the surgeon inserted two metal rods 
into my legs, which stayed there for six weeks. 
My dad waited outside the surgery, my mom 

told me years later, more upset than she’d ever 
seen him.

We’ve never gotten along, my dad and I, in 

the way it seems fathers and sons should, with 
a gentle, intimate camaraderie. My dad and 
grandpa have this — they hunt and fish togeth-
er, watch the baseball game and work on their 
boat. Ours, my dad's and mine, isn’t a relation-
ship filled with conflict but one with a distance, 
quiet yet impassable.

During my freshman year of college, I had a 

sort of eureka moment, an insight that both ter-
rified me and clarified a central question in our 
relationship. I realized how much I had inher-
ited from him, how much I had been formed by 
his presence in my life. Ah yes, I thought, we’re 
too similar. It’s not much of an epiphany — of 
course I was influenced by my dad. But there’s 
some incongruence in our similarities, in the 
ways we crave solitude and the ways we with-
draw into ourselves, that makes it impossible to 
bridge those silences that disturb and sustain 
our relationship.

There’s a shame that followed me, still fol-

lows me, that I hadn’t quite repaid him for the 
life he’s given me, a solid, comfortable, middle-
class life, and that now, or soon, when the debt 
is due, I’ll be penniless. But there’s another 
shame, now, a shame that comes with the 
thought of his dependence, of that condescen-
sion, of somehow taking from him what he’s 
given to me — the opportunity to live indepen-
dently.

And then there’s a silent shame, the core 

shame, which flares now and then, a quiet con-
flagration, the shame I feel for resenting him 
for his body’s failures, for a life that, like me, 
was formed by some fate he didn’t choose.

***
And so we arrived. I took my baggage out of 

the car. I made sure to take as much as I could. 
I knew he’d try to help me and that he’s stub-
born enough to succeed. He put some of the 
lighter things on the porch, and for others, I 
met him halfway to grab them.

“All right. Well, have a good semester,” he 

said.

“Thanks, I’ll see you.”
He opened the door then stopped.
“Do you know how to get back onto the free-

way?”

“Yeah, one second, I’ll look it up on my 

phone. But I think you just have to go back 
down

Packard and turn at Main.”
“Ah, don’t worry about it. I’ll figure it out.”
“Just one second,” I insisted.
“Actually, you know what, you’ll find your 

way.”

The first time I ever went on a date, it was 

with a girl from Tinder. I was 19, fresh off my freshman 
year and spending the summer back home in New York. 
So innocent. So pure. So skinny. I remember seeing the 
notification that Eleanor had messaged me flash on my 
phone and immediately thought she was a bot. Usually 
these bots present themselves as very attractive women 
whose low standards are only matched by the low 
resolution of their photos and a very high interest in your 
routing number. Since she had instead complimented 
my alliterative bio, I took the plunge and messaged back. 
We spoke back and forth mainly in alliteration, then 
assonance, then consonance, then in French, then like 
normal people about Kurt Vonnegut, Soulja Boy’s descent 
from godhood and the trailer for the new SpongeBob 
movie. Our conclusions were as follows: The movie was a 
sham. The whole premise is that SpongeBob and his pals 
are finally adventuring above water. They already did 
this in “Pressure” (Episode 32, Season 2). SpongeBob and 
his posse were all popsicle stick puppets for the above-
water scenes. The movie sold out by making them CGI. 
We would’ve paid good money for a feature-length, 
popsicle-stick, puppet movie. Anyhow, one thing 
lead to another and I asked her on a low-key 
Tinder date.

I don’t drive so my dad offered to dress like 

a Secret Service agent and chauffeur me to 
and from the date. The main problem with 
this plan was that he drove a 2004 Honda 
Odyssey. The windows aren’t even tinted. 
I ended up taking a train two stops over 
to meet her. I still have the ticket stubs 
floating around my room. 

We wandered around town and saw 

the hipster version of Teddy Roosevelt 
and left a bunch of pennies heads up for 
people to find. I accidentally got over-
caffeinated at a Starbucks, which has 
become a reoccurring theme in my love 
life. A lot of that relationship involved 
hooking up in cars, which fortunately 
did not become a reoccurring theme 
in my love life. One day I’ll properly 
delineate the difference between “going 
on dates with,” “dating” and “seeing” 
(and all other variations ad infinitum) 
someone. That day isn’t today. That was 
prelude to disarm the follow: We ended up 
going on dates for the rest of the summer. 

Jenni*

This was my first Tinder booty call. I 

marveled at how she mixed blueberry vodka 
with seltzer. My childlike fascination with basic 
mixed drinks would also become a recurring 
theme in my love life. I had been reading a lot of 
people’s last words and we talked about what we 
wanted ours to be. The word scrimshaw was said at 
some point.

I’ve suppressed the rest of our conversation due to 

what happened when we started hooking up. I had 
whiskey dick (really blueberry vodka and seltzer dick, 

but whatever) and she was very keen on that fact. She 
repeatedly let me know that I was having technical 
difficulties. My expression, not hers. I think I would fall 
in love with someone who referred to my impotency as 
technical difficulties.

Eventually I finished and she told me I really seem like 

I’m autistic, which was not very cool of her. My silence 
was punctuated by the still playing episode of “It’s 
Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Eventually we went back 
to the sex thing and she asked me what she could do to fix 
my poor performance. I was pretty bitter about the whole 
autism thing and asked her to make pterodactyl noises or 
recite the U.S. constitution. I have the subtle belief my 
life is a movie and I do things that would only be funny to 
a live studio audience. Once I broke up with a girl while 

wearing a Drake sweatshirt and smattered Drake lyrics 
throughout the conversation. I love Drake so much. 
Anyhow, digressions aside, she looked at me quizzically. I 
mumbled never mind and kept thrusting. I came; she left. 
I think to do mission work in Africa.

I asked Eleanor* if she thought I seemed autistic; 

she said I was cool and idiosyncratic. We drew Twitter 
participation trophies for one another on the back of 
index cards and sent them back and forth.

I was back in New York a little while ago and Jenni 

and I matched on Tinder, then she unmatched me. So at 
least I now know that this was a sufficiently traumatic 
experience for everyone involved.

Girl Who I Have Literally Zero Idea What Her Name Is

We went to a decent diner and I had an anxiety attack. 

I couldn’t make eye-contact for the majority of the date. 
That went over about as well as you would expect it to. I 
shook her hand and told her this was a very solid two out 
of 10 experience. On the bus ride home, Eleanor* and I 
discussed whether my campers calling me their favorite 

gringo was a compliment or not.

Eleanor* pt. 2 (October 2016)

A couple months ago, I was visiting a friend 

from high school who goes to the same college 
as her and asked if she wanted to get a cup of 
joe. Eleanor did me one better, and invited 
me to her literary society’s wine tour.

It was weird. The conversation didn’t 

flow like it should have even though 
we were both drunk. The pauses were 
punctuated by the wheels on the bus 
going round and round. We had both 
changed a lot but in a lot of the same 
ways, which is to say that we both 
became somewhat depressed leftists 
with an affinity for meme culture. The 
usual millennial liberal arts evolution.

Later that night, we went to a vegan 

dim sum joint and talked about how 
it’s often impossible to fully appreciate 
potato curries. Too often, potatoes are 
left bland despite being drenched in 
sauce. They just don’t absorb flavor 
as well as tofu, really unfortunate 
stuff. It felt like a sufficiently quirky 
conversation. I got what I came for.

All of our dates had ended on public 

transport; some things don’t change. I 
turned around to get one last glimpse of her 
and the bus blurred her form into the street 
lights. I surveyed the crowd of my fellow 

Greyhounders; there was a man resting his 

amputated leg on a CVS basket to keep himself 

steady. It’s impolite to stare so I did what’s natural: 

looked down at my phone and began swiping again.

A Toast to Grandpa John

I

’d wake up feeling sticky. The inside of my mouth, my 
hair, my skin. I would lurch out of the twin bed and 
stumble over to the sink in my dorm room to survey 

the damage. It was all a smudge. My eyeliner down my 
face. My memories of the night before.

I always knew if I had smoked because my chest hurt 

and my fingers tasted salty. I knew what I had eaten 
because it was smeared on my sheets. I knew what I was 
wearing because it would be crumpled on the floor. I had 
clues, and with those I could piece together what I could 
not remember.

This past summer I studied abroad in Oxford, England, 

for five weeks. I stayed at Magdalen College, one of the 
38 colleges that make up the university — which can get 
confusing. Founded in 1458, Magdalen has its own living 
quarters, classrooms, chapel, graveyard, library and lec-
ture halls. It even has its own bar.

I adored that bar for being so peculiar and un-Ameri-

can. There’s nothing like it at the University of Michigan, 
where I would be continuing my senior year that fall. I 
can only imagine the wealth of furious emails the Office 
of Student Life would receive if the Michigan Union 
started serving happy hour for undergrads. But here 
it was commonplace, part of the tradition with which I 
would dive in head-first to engage. The bar was situated 
near the stairs to the dining hall, and after dinner I would 
wait until its doors opened at 7 p.m. Charmed as I am by 
young men in black T-shirts pouring me drinks, I spent a 
great deal of my time and money at the Old Kitchen Bar. I 
was unaware, however, that I toasted each hard cider and 
single malt scotch to my departed grandfather.

Grandpa John, with his funny quirk of getting drunk 

and belting his children, was the nightmare that haunt-
ed my youth and young adult life. He was an anecdote, a 
punchline, a warning and a promise. But more than that, 
he was a folk story, dusted off by my aunt and occasion-
ally my mother every time I went out to a party or, when I 
became of age, a bar with my friends.

It was in England when I first began to think seriously 

about my grandfather John, a man I had never met nor 
had anything in common with besides one-quarter of my 
genes. John had been a soldier during WWII, when he 
met my grandmother while stationed in her tiny Italian 
village. He survived a Russian labor camp, and left his 
entire family behind to start a new life in Canada and 
then eventually America. He died in the 1980s of prostate 
cancer and it was one of those deaths that wasn’t sad for 
everyone. Because John was an asshole.

My grandmother — my Nona, as they say in Italy — 

wears a hearing aid. It used to malfunction constantly. It’s 
probably the most irritating part of my childhood, listen-
ing to it whistle and chirp at me. “What? What? What did 
she say?”

He broke that ear, John did. More specifically, the 

eardrum, by throwing her up against the wall time after 
time, day after day. It ripped or shattered or whatever 
eardrums do when they stop working. Thirty years after 
his death, technological advancement replaced what he 
took from her. But my grandmother’s whistling ear was a 
reminder growing up, that somewhere in the mess of spi-
rals and double-helixes was the capacity to lose myself to 
an addiction and use it against the ones I love.

Our last evening at Magdalen was my worst. I will never 

forget what I can remember about that night. During our 

final formal dinner we had, as usual, a champagne recep-
tion on the gorgeous green lawns of the Harry Potter-
esque quadrangle. One glass per student was the rule. But 
for a special bon voyage, they’d “top up” our glasses, the 
posh British way of saying bottomless bubbly. The server, 
an Italian whose name sounded like a cleaning product, 
was particularly generous.

Throughout the program, they would serve us wine 

just once a week during Monday night dinners. For the 
first course we’d always have a white wine that tasted like 
vinegar. Tonight, it was sweet. But the red wine with the 
entree was seductive, wet and deep. I had three of those. 
My speech began to slur. Speaking to my tutor — who had 
yet to finalize my grade — across the dining table was a 
struggle. My dress felt tight and my face grew increas-
ingly hotter. I couldn’t hear her over the sound of my 
drunkenness, as if the wine was sloshing around in my 
ears. I couldn’t even hear me. I must have known to slow 
down because I only had two glasses of port, a heavily 
saccharine wine, when it was served with chocolate and 
strawberries. Delicious.

I ran wild that last night in Oxford. Only flashes remain. 

We ended up, as one does, at the Half Moon, because it 
was a townie bar that opened late. It was the definition of 
quaint, with low ceilings with wooden beams and a juke-
box in the corner. It was where the old English drunks 
would wash in like debris from the tide. We washed in, 
too, with bodies full of wine that clouded our vision and 
judgement.

That night was a hazy kaleidoscope of semi-familiar 

faces. Someone thought it was a good idea to buy me a 
shot of vodka. I remember finding this hilarious, and 
then very little after that. I shouted instead of speaking. I 
tripped as I was walking. I left when I should have stayed.

One of the bartenders at the Half Moon — I told you, I 

have a thing for bartenders — was called Tobias. He had 
studied philosophy, pulled his hair back into a bun and 
could roll a perfect joint. We went out for a cigarette and 
he took me around the bar, pressing me up against the 
wall. He kissed me sloppily, or I could have been the slop-
py one, his hands gripping my arms to keep them against 
the bricks. One of his hands shifted to stabilize my shoul-
der while the other slipped down my pants.

I retained enough sense, enough self, to shove Tobias 

off, my own back still against the bricks of the Half Moon. 
He was grinning, having gotten more than he’d expected. 
He asked if I wanted to come back to his place. I mostly 
wanted to throw up.

It was late. We stumbled back to the front of the bar 

where my friends stood waiting. They wanted to go home. 
His hand was still around my waist.

I found out later from a friend that he had a girlfriend. 

I found out later that he asked that same friend if she was 
interested in having a threesome. I found out later the 
plan was to include me.

I was swaying lightly in the shadows in front of the bar 

while my friends looked on with pained expressions. I 
said things no rational person would. I leaned against him 
heavily. I deliberated when I should have been deliberate. 
I lingered, but I should have left.

The hangover lasted until the plane cleared 

Greenland. For every minute of the eight-hour 
flight, I felt that I deserved it. I felt like a dried-
up starfish without a sand dollar to my name. 

Mostly because I had run out of money. I had worked and 
saved all summer, and now I didn’t have enough cash left 
for the bus ticket to the airport, or even a cup of coffee. 
My friends paid my way. My friends held my hand. My 
friends got me home.

After Oxford, I had scared the living shit out of myself. 

I felt guilty for what I had put my friends through, for 
forcing his weaknesses on them. Mine or his? Who was 
driving that night: John, or me? I resolved to abstain from 
alcohol. 

This plan backfired quickly. By not drinking, I didn’t 

feel a return to self. I felt that I was depriving myself. 
“You’re not drinking?” they’d say, like they didn’t know 
what else to do with me if I was sober. “Is something 
wrong?”

Yes, I would argue to myself. Something is wrong. It’s 

my damn Grandpa John. I let him win.

I started drinking again about two weeks after I got 

back from Oxford. I was sitting on my couch in my old 
apartment next to a friend. I had a long conversation with 
the man behind the counter at the liquor store. He hadn’t 
seen me in a while. Wanted to know where I’d been

I got drunk that night, but was focused on not losing 

myself. I sent my friend home at a respectable hour and 
went to bed. It was a test, and by my standards, I had 
passed.

I’m certainly not the first student to overindulge while 

abroad. Many of my friends have described similar expe-
riences where nights bled into days and afternoons try-
ing to study or travel through hangovers. But without the 
threat of John, I wouldn’t have taken it so seriously. Or 
so personally.

I haven’t given up drinking. I may never. I don’t think I 

have a problem. Regardless, it’s not in my nature to quit. 
It’s not in my genes.

Over 400 people were present to protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline 
in North Dakota, which will cross land belonging to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and has 
the potential to contaminate their water access. The protest was planned and run by Native 
Americans who came from across Michigan to stand up for Standing Rock.
